74,A LIFE-DRAMA.,
75,"WALTER,","WALTER,"
76,"WALTER,",_Reading from a paper on which he has been writing_.
77,"WALTER,",
78,"WALTER,","As a wild maiden, with love-drinking eyes,"
79,"WALTER,","Sees in sweet dreams a beaming Youth of Glory,"
80,"WALTER,","And wakes to weep, and ever after, sighs"
81,"WALTER,",For that bright vision till her hair is hoary;
82,"WALTER,","Ev'n so, alas! is my life's-passion story."
83,"WALTER,","For Poesy my heart and pulses beat,"
84,"WALTER,","For Poesy my blood runs red and fleet,"
85,"WALTER,","As Aaron's serpent the Egyptians' swallow'd,"
86,"WALTER,",One passion eats the rest. My soul is follow'd
87,"WALTER,","By strong ambition to out-roll a lay,"
88,"WALTER,","Whose melody will haunt the world for aye,"
89,"WALTER,",Charming it onward on its golden way.
90,"WALTER,",[_Tears the paper and paces the room with disordered steps._
91,"WALTER,","Oh, that my heart were quiet as a grave"
92,"WALTER,",Asleep in moonlight!
93,"WALTER,","For, as a torrid sunset boils with gold"
94,"WALTER,","Up to the zenith, fierce within my soul"
95,"WALTER,",A passion burns from basement to the cope.
96,"WALTER,","Poesy! Poesy! I'd give to thee,"
97,"WALTER,","As passionately, my rich-laden years,"
98,"WALTER,","My bubble pleasures, and my awful joys,"
99,"WALTER,",As Hero gave her trembling sighs to find
100,"WALTER,",Delicious death on wet Leander's lip.
101,"WALTER,","Bare, bald, and tawdry, as a fingered moth,"
102,"WALTER,","Is my poor life, but with one smile thou canst"
103,"WALTER,",Clothe me with kingdoms. Wilt thou smile on me?
104,"WALTER,",Wilt bid me die for thee? O fair and cold!
105,"WALTER,",As well may some wild maiden waste her love
106,"WALTER,",Upon the calm front of a marble Jove.
107,"WALTER,",I cannot draw regard of thy great eyes.
108,"WALTER,","I love thee, Poesy! Thou art a rock,"
109,"WALTER,","I, a weak wave, would break on thee and die."
110,"WALTER,",There is a deadlier pang than that which beads
111,"WALTER,","With chilly death-drops the o'er-tortured brow,"
112,"WALTER,","When one has a big heart and feeble hands,--"
113,"WALTER,",A heart to hew his name out upon time
114,"WALTER,","As on a rock, then in immortalness"
115,"WALTER,",To stand on time as on a pedestal;
116,"WALTER,","When hearts beat to this tune, and hands are weak,"
117,"WALTER,","We find our aspirations quenched in tears,"
118,"WALTER,","The tears of impotence, and self-contempt"
119,"WALTER,","That loathsome weed, up-springing in the heart,"
120,"WALTER,",Like nightshade 'mong the ruins of a shrine;
121,"WALTER,","I am so cursed, and wear within my soul"
122,"WALTER,","A pang as fierce as Dives' drowsed with wine,"
123,"WALTER,",Lipping his leman in luxurious dreams;
124,"WALTER,",Waked by a fiend in hell!----
125,"WALTER,","'T is not for me, ye Heavens! 't is not for me"
126,"WALTER,","To fling a Poem, like a comet, out,"
127,"WALTER,",Far-splendouring the sleepy realms of night.
128,"WALTER,","I cannot give men glimpses so divine,"
129,"WALTER,","As when, upon a racking night, the wind"
130,"WALTER,","Draws the pale curtains of the vapoury clouds,"
131,"WALTER,","And shows those wonderful, mysterious voids,"
132,"WALTER,",Throbbing with stars like pulses.--Naught for me
133,"WALTER,",But to creep quietly into my grave;
134,"WALTER,",Or calm and tame the swelling of my heart
135,"WALTER,","With this foul lie, painted as sweet as truth."
136,"WALTER,","That ""great and small, weakness and strength, are naught,"
137,"WALTER,","That each thing being equal in its sphere,"
138,"WALTER,","The May-night glow-worm with its emerald lamp,"
139,"WALTER,",Is worthy as the mighty moon that drowns
140,"WALTER,","Continents in her white and silent light."""
141,"WALTER,","This--this were easy to believe, were I"
142,"WALTER,",The planet that doth nightly wash the earth's
143,"WALTER,",Fair sides with moonlight; not the shining worm.
144,"WALTER,","But as I am--beaten, and foiled, and shamed,"
145,"WALTER,",The arrow of my soul which I have shot
146,"WALTER,","To bring down Fame, dissolved like shaft of mist--"
147,"WALTER,","This painted falsehood, this most damned lie,"
148,"WALTER,","Freezes me like a fiendish human face,"
149,"WALTER,",With all its features gathered in a sneer.
150,"WALTER,","Oh, let me rend this breathing tent of flesh;"
151,"WALTER,","Uncoop the soul--fool, fool, 't were still the same,"
152,"WALTER,","'T is the deep soul that's touch'd, _it_ bears the wound;"
153,"WALTER,","And memory doth stick in 't like a knife,"
154,"WALTER,",Keeping it wide for ever.             [_A long pause._
155,"WALTER,",I am fain
156,"WALTER,",To feed upon the beauty of the moon!
157,"WALTER,",[_Opens the casement._
158,"WALTER,","Sorrowful moon! seeming so drowned in woe,"
159,"WALTER,","A queen, whom some grand battle-day has left"
160,"WALTER,","Unkingdomed and a widow, while the stars,"
161,"WALTER,","Thy handmaidens, are standing back in awe,"
162,"WALTER,",Gazing in silence on thy mighty grief!
163,"WALTER,","All men have loved thee for thy beauty, moon!"
164,"WALTER,","Adam has turned from Eve's fair face to thine,"
165,"WALTER,",And drunk thy beauty with his serene eyes.
166,"WALTER,","Anthony once, when seated with his queen,"
167,"WALTER,","Worth all the East, a moment gazed at thee:"
168,"WALTER,","She struck him on the cheek with jealous hand,"
169,"WALTER,","And chiding said,--""Now, by my Egypt's gods,"
170,"WALTER,",That pale and squeamish beauty of the night
171,"WALTER,",Has had thine eyes too long; thine eyes are mine!
172,"WALTER,",Alack! there's sorrow in my Anthony's face!
173,"WALTER,","Dost think of Rome? I'll make thee, with a kiss,"
174,"WALTER,","Richer than CÃ¦sar! Come, I'll crown thy lips."""
175,"WALTER,",[_Another pause._
176,"WALTER,",How tenderly the moon doth fill the night!
177,"WALTER,",Not like the passion that doth fill my soul;
178,"WALTER,",It burns within me like an Indian sun.
179,"WALTER,","A star is trembling on the horizon's verge,"
180,"WALTER,","That star shall grow and broaden on the night,"
181,"WALTER,",Until it hangs divine and beautiful
182,"WALTER,",In the proud zenith--
183,"WALTER,",Might I so broaden on the skies of fame!
184,"WALTER,",O Fame! Fame! Fame! next grandest word to God!
185,"WALTER,",I seek the look of Fame! Poor fool--so tries
186,"WALTER,",Some lonely wanderer 'mong the desert sands
187,"WALTER,","By shouts to gain the notice of the Sphynx,"
188,"WALTER,",Staring right on with calm eternal eyes.
189,"WALTER,",
190,"WALTER,",

197,LADY.,LADY.
198,LADY.,
199,LADY.,"Halt! Flora, halt! This race"
200,LADY.,"Has danced my ringlets all about my brows,"
201,LADY.,And brought my cheeks to bloom. Here will I rest
202,LADY.,And weave a garland for thy dappled neck.
203,LADY.,[_Weaves flowers._
204,LADY.,"I look, sweet Flora, in thine innocent eyes,"
205,LADY.,And see in them a meaning and a glee
206,LADY.,Fitting this universal summer joy:
207,LADY.,"Each leaf upon the trees doth shake with joy,"
208,LADY.,"With joy the white clouds navigate the blue,"
209,LADY.,"And, on his painted wings, the butterfly,"
210,LADY.,"Most splendid masker in this carnival,"
211,LADY.,"Floats through the air in joy! Better for man,"
212,LADY.,Were he and Nature more familiar friends!
213,LADY.,His part is worst that touches this base world.
214,LADY.,"Although the ocean's inmost heart be pure,"
215,LADY.,Yet the salt fringe that daily licks the shore
216,LADY.,"Is gross with sand. On, my sweet Flora, on!"
217,LADY.,[_Rises and approaches_ WALTER.
218,LADY.,"Ha! what is this? A bright and wander'd youth,"
219,LADY.,"Thick in the light of his own beauty, sleeps"
220,LADY.,"Like young Apollo, in his golden curls!"
221,LADY.,"At the oak-roots I've seen full many a flower,"
222,LADY.,"But never one so fair. A lovely youth,"
223,LADY.,"With dainty cheeks and ringlets like a girl,"
224,LADY.,And slumber-parted lips 'twere sweet to kiss!
225,LADY.,Ye envious lids! I fain would see his eyes!
226,LADY.,Jewels so richly cased as those of his
227,LADY.,"Must be a sight. So, here's a well-worn book,"
228,LADY.,From which he drinks such joy as doth a pale
229,LADY.,"And dim-eyed worker who escapes, in Spring,"
230,LADY.,"The thousand-streeted and smoke-smothered town,"
231,LADY.,And treads awhile the breezy hills of health.
232,LADY.,"[LADY _opens the book, a slip of paper falls out;"
233,LADY.,she reads._
234,LADY.,
235,LADY.,"The fierce exulting worlds, the motes in rays,"
236,LADY.,"The churlish thistles, scented briers,"
237,LADY.,"The wind-swept blue-bells on the sunny braes,"
238,LADY.,"Down to the central fires,"
239,LADY.,
240,LADY.,"Exist alike in Love. Love is a sea,"
241,LADY.,Filling all the abysses dim
242,LADY.,"Of lornest space, in whose deeps regally"
243,LADY.,Suns and their bright broods swim.
244,LADY.,
245,LADY.,"This mighty sea of Love with wondrous tides,"
246,LADY.,Is sternly just to sun and grain;
247,LADY.,"'Tis laving at this moment Saturn's sides,--"
248,LADY.,'Tis in my blood and brain.
249,LADY.,
250,LADY.,All things have something more than barren use;
251,LADY.,"There is a scent upon the brier,"
252,LADY.,"A tremulous splendour in the autumn dews,"
253,LADY.,Cold morns are fringed with fire;
254,LADY.,
255,LADY.,The clodded earth goes up in sweet-breathed flowers;
256,LADY.,"In music dies poor human speech,"
257,LADY.,"And into beauty blow those hearts of ours,"
258,LADY.,When Love is born in each.
259,LADY.,
260,LADY.,Life is transfigured in the soft and tender
261,LADY.,"Light of Love, as a volume dun"
262,LADY.,Of rolling smoke becomes a wreathÃ¨d splendour
263,LADY.,In the declining sun.
264,LADY.,
265,LADY.,"Driven from cities by his restless moods,"
266,LADY.,"In incense-glooms and secret nooks,"
267,LADY.,A miser o'er his gold--the lover broods
268,LADY.,"O'er vague words, earnest looks."
269,LADY.,
270,LADY.,Oft is he startled on the sweetest lip;
271,LADY.,Across his midnight sea of mind
272,LADY.,"A Thought comes streaming, like a blazing ship"
273,LADY.,"Upon a mighty wind,"
274,LADY.,
275,LADY.,"A Terror and a Glory! Shocked with light,"
276,LADY.,His boundless being glares aghast;
277,LADY.,"Then slowly settles down the wonted night,"
278,LADY.,All desolate and vast.
279,LADY.,
280,LADY.,"Daisies are white upon the churchyard sod,"
281,LADY.,"Sweet tears, the clouds lean down and give."
282,LADY.,"This world is very lovely. O my God,"
283,LADY.,I thank Thee that I live!
284,LADY.,
285,LADY.,"Ringed with his flaming guards of many kinds,"
286,LADY.,"The proud Sun stoops his golden head,"
287,LADY.,Grey Eve sobs crazed with grief; to her the winds
288,LADY.,"Shriek out, ""The Day is dead."""
289,LADY.,
290,LADY.,"I gave this beggar Day no alms, this Night"
291,LADY.,"Has seen nor work accomplished, planned,"
292,LADY.,Yet this poor Day shall soon in memory's light
293,LADY.,A summer rainbow stand!
294,LADY.,
295,LADY.,There is no evil in this present strife;
296,LADY.,"From th' shivering Seal's low moans,"
297,LADY.,"Up through the shining tiers and ranks of life,"
298,LADY.,"To stars upon their thrones,"
299,LADY.,
300,LADY.,The seeming ills are Loves in dim disguise;
301,LADY.,"Dark moral knots, that pose the seer,"
302,LADY.,"If _we_ are lovers, in our wider eyes"
303,LADY.,"Shall hang, like dew-drops, clear."
304,LADY.,
305,LADY.,"Ye are my menials, ye thick-crowding years!"
306,LADY.,Ha! yet with a triumphant shout
307,LADY.,"My spirit shall take captive all the spheres,"
308,LADY.,And wring their riches out.
309,LADY.,
310,LADY.,God! what a glorious future gleams on me;
311,LADY.,"With nobler senses, nobler peers,"
312,LADY.,"I'll wing me through Creation like a bee,"
313,LADY.,And taste the gleaming spheres!
314,LADY.,
315,LADY.,"While some are trembling o'er the poison-cup,"
316,LADY.,"While some grow lean with care, some weep,"
317,LADY.,"In this luxurious faith I'll wrap me up,"
318,LADY.,"As in a robe, and sleep."
319,LADY.,
320,LADY.,"Oh, 'tis a sleeping Poet! and his verse"
321,LADY.,Sings like the syren-isles. An opulent Soul
322,LADY.,"Dropt in my path like a great cup of gold,"
323,LADY.,All rich and rough with stories of the gods!
324,LADY.,"Methinks all poets should be gentle, fair,"
325,LADY.,"And ever young, and ever beautiful:"
326,LADY.,"I'd have all Poets to be like to this,--"
327,LADY.,"Gold-haired and rosy-lipped, to sing of Love."
328,LADY.,"Love! Love! Old song that Poet ever chanteth,"
329,LADY.,Of which the listening world is never weary.
330,LADY.,"Soul is a moon, Love is its loveliest phase."
331,LADY.,Alas! to me this Love will never come
332,LADY.,Till summer days shall visit dark December.
333,LADY.,"Woe's me! 'tis very sad, but 'tis my doom"
334,LADY.,"To hide a ghastly grief within my heart,"
335,LADY.,"And then to coin my lying cheek to smiles,"
336,LADY.,"Sure, smiles become a victim garlanded!"
337,LADY.,Hist! he awakes----
338,LADY.,
339,LADY.,WALTER (_awakening_).
340,LADY.,
341,LADY.,"Fair lady, in my dream"
342,LADY.,"Methought I was a weak and lonely bird,"
343,LADY.,"In search of summer, wander'd on the sea,"
344,LADY.,"Toiling through mists, drenched by the arrowy rain,"
345,LADY.,"Struck by the heartless winds: at last, methought"
346,LADY.,I came upon an isle in whose sweet air
347,LADY.,"I dried my feathers, smoothed my ruffled breast,"
348,LADY.,And skimmed delight from off the waving woods.
349,LADY.,"Thy coming, lady, reads this dream of mine:"
350,LADY.,"I am the swallow, thou the summer land."
351,LADY.,
352,LADY.,LADY.
353,LADY.,
354,LADY.,"Sweet, sweet is flattery to mortal ears,"
355,LADY.,"And, if I drink thy praise too greedily,"
356,LADY.,My fault I'll match with grosser instances.
357,LADY.,Do not the royal souls that van the world
358,LADY.,Hunger for praises? Does not the hero burn
359,LADY.,To blow his triumphs in the trumpet's mouth?
360,LADY.,And do not poets' brows throb feverous
361,LADY.,"Till they are cooled with laurels? Therefore, sir,"
362,LADY.,If such dote more on praise than all the wealth
363,LADY.,"Of precious-wombÃ¨d earth and pearlÃ¨d mains,"
364,LADY.,Blame not the cheeks of simple maidenhood.
365,LADY.,"Fair sir, I am the empress of this wood!"
366,LADY.,"The courtier oaks bow in proud homages,"
367,LADY.,And shake down o'er my path their golden leaves.
368,LADY.,Queen am I of this green and summer realm.
369,LADY.,This wood I've entered oft when all in sheen
370,LADY.,"The princely Morning walks o'er diamond dews,"
371,LADY.,"And still have lingered, till the vain young Night"
372,LADY.,Trembles o'er her own beauty in the sea.
373,LADY.,
374,WALTER.,WALTER.
375,WALTER.,
376,WALTER.,"And as thou passest some mid-forest glade,"
377,WALTER.,"The simple woodman stands amazed, as if"
378,WALTER.,An angel flashed by on his gorgeous wings.
379,WALTER.,
380,LADY.,LADY.
381,LADY.,
382,LADY.,I am thine empress. Who and what art thou?
383,LADY.,"Art thou Sir Bookworm? Haunter of old tomes,"
384,LADY.,Sitting the silent term of stars to watch
385,LADY.,"Your own thought passing into beauty, like"
386,LADY.,An earnest mother watching the first smile
387,LADY.,"Dawning upon her sleeping infant's face,"
388,LADY.,Until she cannot see it for her tears?
389,LADY.,"And when the lark, the laureate of the sun,"
390,LADY.,"Doth climb the east, eager to celebrate"
391,LADY.,"His monarch's crowning, goeth pale to bed,--"
392,LADY.,"Art thou such denizen of book-world, pray?"
393,LADY.,
394,WALTER.,WALTER.
395,WALTER.,
396,WALTER.,"Books written when the soul is at spring-tide,"
397,WALTER.,When it is laden like a groaning sky
398,WALTER.,"Before a thunder-storm, are power and gladness,"
399,WALTER.,And majesty and beauty. They seize the reader
400,WALTER.,"As tempests seize a ship, and bear him on"
401,WALTER.,"With a wild joy. Some books are drenchÃ¨d sands,"
402,WALTER.,"On which a great soul's wealth lies all in heaps,"
403,WALTER.,Like a wrecked argosy. What power in books!
404,WALTER.,"They mingle gloom and splendour, as I've oft,"
405,WALTER.,"In thund'rous sunsets, seen the thunder-piles"
406,WALTER.,Seamed with dull fire and fiercest glory-rents.
407,WALTER.,"They awe me to my knees, as if I stood"
408,WALTER.,In presence of a king. They give me tears;
409,WALTER.,"Such glorious tears as Eve's fair daughters shed,"
410,WALTER.,"When first they clasped a Son of God, all bright"
411,WALTER.,"With burning plumes and splendours of the sky,"
412,WALTER.,In zoning heaven of their milky arms.
413,WALTER.,How few read books aright! Most souls are shut
414,WALTER.,"By sense from grandeur, as a man who snores,"
415,WALTER.,"Night-capped and wrapt in blankets to the nose,"
416,WALTER.,"Is shut in from the night, which, like a sea,"
417,WALTER.,Breaketh for ever on a strand of stars.
418,WALTER.,"Lady, in book-world have I ever dwelt,"
419,WALTER.,This book has domed my being like a sky.
420,WALTER.,
421,LADY.,LADY.
422,LADY.,
423,LADY.,And who was its creator?
424,LADY.,
425,WALTER.,WALTER.
426,WALTER.,
427,WALTER.,He was one
428,WALTER.,"Who could not help it, for it was his nature"
429,WALTER.,"To blossom into song, as 'tis a tree's"
430,WALTER.,To leaf itself in April.
431,WALTER.,
432,LADY.,LADY.
433,LADY.,
434,LADY.,Did he love?
435,LADY.,
436,WALTER.,WALTER.
437,WALTER.,
438,WALTER.,Ay; and he suffered.--His was not that love
439,WALTER.,That comes on men with their beards. His soul was rich;
440,WALTER.,"And this his book unveils it, as the night"
441,WALTER.,"Her panting wealth of stars. The world was cold,"
442,WALTER.,And he went down like a lone ship at sea;
443,WALTER.,And now the fame that scorned him while he lived
444,WALTER.,Waits on him like a menial.----
445,WALTER.,When the dark dumb Earth
446,WALTER.,"Lay on her back and watched the shining stars,"
447,WALTER.,A Soul from its warm body shuddered out
448,WALTER.,To the dim air and trembled with the cold;
449,WALTER.,"Through the waste air it passed as swift and still,"
450,WALTER.,"As a dream passes through the lands of sleep,"

497,LADY.,"The Lady Blanche was saintly fair,"

540,WALTER.,Still o'er him rose those melancholy stars!
541,WALTER.,"Unknown his childhood, save that he was born"
542,WALTER.,'Mong woodland waters full of silver breaks;
543,WALTER.,That he grew up 'mong primroses moon-pale
544,WALTER.,In the hearts of purple hills; that he o'er ran
545,WALTER.,"Green meadows golden in the level sun,"
546,WALTER.,"A bright-haired child; and that, when these he left"
547,WALTER.,"To dwell within a monstrous city's heart,"
548,WALTER.,"The trees were gazing up into the sky,"
549,WALTER.,Their bare arms stretched in prayer for the snows.
550,WALTER.,"When first we met, his book was six months old,"
551,WALTER.,And eagerly his name was buzzed abroad;
552,WALTER.,"Praises fell thick on him. Men said, ""This Dawn"
553,WALTER.,Will widen to a clear and boundless Day;
554,WALTER.,And when it ripens to a sumptuous west
555,WALTER.,"With a great sunset 'twill be closed and crowned."""
556,WALTER.,Lady! he was as far 'bove common men
557,WALTER.,"As a sun-steed, wild-eyed and meteor-maned,"
558,WALTER.,"Neighing the reeling stars, is 'bove a hack"
559,WALTER.,With sluggish veins of mud. More tremulous
560,WALTER.,Than the soft star that in the azure east
561,WALTER.,"Trembles with pity o'er bright bleeding day,"
562,WALTER.,Was his frail soul; I dwelt with him for years;
563,WALTER.,I was to him but Labrador to Ind;
564,WALTER.,His pearls were plentier than my pebble-stones.
565,WALTER.,"He was the sun, I was that squab--the earth,"
566,WALTER.,And basked me in his light until he drew
567,WALTER.,"Flowers from my barren sides. Oh! he was rich,"
568,WALTER.,"And I rejoiced upon his shore of pearls,"
569,WALTER.,"A weak enamoured sea. Once did he say,"
570,WALTER.,"""My Friend! a Poet must ere long arise,"
571,WALTER.,"And with a regal song sun-crown this age,"
572,WALTER.,As a saint's head is with a halo crown'd;--
573,WALTER.,"One, who shall hallow Poetry to God"
574,WALTER.,"And to its own high use, for Poetry is"
575,WALTER.,The grandest chariot wherein king-thoughts ride;--
576,WALTER.,"One, who shall fervent grasp the sword of song"
577,WALTER.,"As a stern swordsman grasps his keenest blade,"
578,WALTER.,To find the quickest passage to the heart.
579,WALTER.,A mighty Poet whom this age shall choose
580,WALTER.,To be its spokesman to all coming times.
581,WALTER.,"In the ripe full-blown season of his soul,"
582,WALTER.,"He shall go forward in his spirit's strength,"
583,WALTER.,"And grapple with the questions of all time,"
584,WALTER.,And wring from them their meanings. As King Saul
585,WALTER.,Called up the buried prophet from his grave
586,WALTER.,"To speak his doom, so shall this Poet-king"
587,WALTER.,Call up the dead Past from its awful grave
588,WALTER.,To tell him of our future. As the air

591,WALTER.,"Reflects the flower, tree, rook, and bending heaven,"
592,WALTER.,Shall he reflect our great humanity;
593,WALTER.,And as the young Spring breathes with living breath
594,WALTER.,"On a dead branch, till it sprouts fragrantly"
595,WALTER.,"Green leaves and sunny flowers, shall he breathe life"
596,WALTER.,"Through every theme he touch, making all Beauty"
597,WALTER.,"And Poetry for ever like the stars."""
598,WALTER.,"His words set me on fire; I cried aloud,"
599,WALTER.,"""Gods! what a portion to forerun this Soul!"""
600,WALTER.,"He grasped my hand,--I looked upon his face,--"
601,WALTER.,"A thought struck all the blood into his cheeks,"
602,WALTER.,Like a strong buffet. His great flashing eyes
603,WALTER.,"Burned on mine own. He said, ""A grim old king,"
604,WALTER.,Whose blood leapt madly when the trumpets brayed
605,WALTER.,"To joyous battle 'mid a storm of steeds,"
606,WALTER.,Won a rich kingdom on a battle-day;
607,WALTER.,"But in the sunset he was ebbing fast,"
608,WALTER.,Ringed by his weeping lords. His left hand held
609,WALTER.,"His white steed, to the belly splashed with blood,"
610,WALTER.,That seemed to mourn him with its drooping head;
611,WALTER.,"His right, his broken brand; and in his ear"
612,WALTER.,His old victorious banners flap the winds.
613,WALTER.,"He called his faithful herald to his side,--"
614,WALTER.,"'Go! tell the dead I come!' With a proud smile,"
615,WALTER.,"The warrior with a stab let out his soul,"
616,WALTER.,"Which fled and shrieked through all the other world,"
617,WALTER.,'Ye dead! My master comes!' And there was pause
618,WALTER.,"Till the great shade should enter. Like that herald,"
619,WALTER.,"Walter, I'd rush across this waiting world"
620,WALTER.,"And cry, '_He_ comes!'"" Lady, wilt hear the song?"
621,WALTER.,[_Sings._
622,WALTER.,
623,WALTER.,"In the street, the tide of being, how it surges, how it rolls!"
624,WALTER.,"God! what base ignoble faces, God! what bodies wanting souls,"
625,WALTER.,"'Mid this stream of human being, banked by houses tall and grim,"
626,WALTER.,"Pale I stand this shining morrow with a pant for woodlands dim,"
627,WALTER.,"To hear the soft and whispering rain, feel the dewy cool of leaves,"
628,WALTER.,"Watch the lightnings dart like swallows round the brooding thunder-eaves,"
629,WALTER.,"To lose the sense of whirling streets, 'mong breezy crests of hills,"
630,WALTER.,"Skies of larks, and hazy landscapes, with fine threads of silver rills,--"
631,WALTER.,"Stand with forehead bathed in sunset on a mountain's summer crown,"
632,WALTER.,"And look up and watch the shadow of the great night coming down,"
633,WALTER.,"One great life in my myriad veins, in leaves, in flowers, in cloudy cars,"
634,WALTER.,"Blowing, underfoot, in clover; beating, overhead, in stars!"
635,WALTER.,"Once I saw a blissful harvest-moon, but not through forest-leaves;"
636,WALTER.,"'Twas not whitening o'er a country, costly with the pilÃ¨d sheaves;"
637,WALTER.,"Rose not o'er the am'rous ocean, trembling round his happy isles;"
638,WALTER.,"It came circling large and queenly o'er yon roof of smoky tiles,"
639,WALTER.,"And I saw it with such feeling, joy in blood, in heart, in brain,"
640,WALTER.,"I would give to call the affluence of that moment back again,"
641,WALTER.,"Europe, with her cities, rivers, hills of prey, sheep-sprinkled downs,--"
642,WALTER.,"Ay, a hundred sheaves of sceptres! Ay, a planet's gathered crowns!"
643,WALTER.,"For with that resplendent harvest-moon, my inmost thoughts were shared"
644,WALTER.,"By a bright and shining maiden, hazel-eyed and golden-haired;"
645,WALTER.,"One blest hour we sat together in a lone and silent place,"
646,WALTER.,"O'er us, starry tears were trembling on the mighty midnight's face."
647,WALTER.,"Gradual crept my arm around her, 'gainst my shoulder came her head,"
648,WALTER.,"And I could but draw her closer, whilst I tremulously said,--"
649,WALTER.,"""Passion as it runs grows purer, loses every tinge of clay,"
650,WALTER.,"As from Dawn all red and turbid flows the white transparent Day,"
651,WALTER.,"And in mingled lives of lovers, the array of human ills"
652,WALTER.,"Breaks their gentle course to music, as the stones break summer rills."""
653,WALTER.,"""You should give the world,"" she murmured, ""such delicious thoughts as"
654,WALTER.,"these."""
655,WALTER.,"""They are fit to line portmanteaus;"" ""Nay,"" she whispered, ""Memories."""
656,WALTER.,"And thereat she looked upon me with a smile so full of grace,"
657,WALTER.,All my blood was in a moment glowing in my ardent face!
658,WALTER.,"Half-blind, I looked up to the host of palpitating stars,"
659,WALTER.,"'Gainst my sides my heart was leaping, like a lion 'gainst his bars,"
660,WALTER.,"For a thought was born within me, and I said within my mind,"
661,WALTER.,"""I will risk all in this moment, I will either lose or find."""
662,WALTER.,"""Dost thou love me?"" then I whispered; for a minute after this,"
663,WALTER.,I sat and trembled in great blackness--On my lips I felt a kiss;--
664,WALTER.,"Than a roseleaf's touch 'twas lighter,--on her face her hands she prest,"
665,WALTER.,And a heaven of tears and blushes was deep buried in my breast.
666,WALTER.,"I could make _her_ faith, _my_ passion, a wide mark for scorn and sneers,"
667,WALTER.,I could laugh a hollow laughter but for these hot bursting tears;
668,WALTER.,"In the strong hand of my frenzy, laws and statutes snapt like reeds,"
669,WALTER.,And furious as a wounded bull I tore at all the creeds;
670,WALTER.,"I rushed into the desert, where I stood with hopeless eyes,"
671,WALTER.,"Glaring on vast desolations, barren sands, and empty skies!"
672,WALTER.,"Soon a trembling naked figure, to the earth my face was bowed,"
673,WALTER.,For the curse of God gloomed o'er me like a bursting thunder-cloud.
674,WALTER.,"Rolled away that fearful darkness, pass'd my weakness, pass'd my grief,"
675,WALTER.,Washed with bitter tears I sat full in the sunshine of belief.
676,WALTER.,"Weary eyes are looking eastward, whence the golden sun upsprings,"
677,WALTER.,"Cry the young and fervid spirits, clad with ardour as with wings,"
678,WALTER.,"""Life and Soul make wretched jangling, they should mingle to one Sire"
679,WALTER.,As the lovely voices mingle in a holy temple choir.
680,WALTER.,"O! those souls of ours, my brothers! prisoned now in mortal bars,"
681,WALTER.,"Have been riched by growth and travel, by the round of all the stars."
682,WALTER.,"Soul, alas! is unregarded; Brothers! it is closely shut:"
683,WALTER.,"All unknown as royal Alfred in the Saxon neatherd's hut,"
684,WALTER.,"In the Dark house of the Body, cooking victuals, lighting fires,"
685,WALTER.,"Swelters on the starry stranger, to our nature's base desires."
686,WALTER.,From its lips is 't any marvel that no revelations come?
687,WALTER.,We have wronged it; we do wrong it--'tis majestically dumb!
688,WALTER.,God! our souls are aproned waiters! God! our souls are hired slaves:
689,WALTER.,"Let us hide from Life, my Brothers! let us hide us in our graves."
690,WALTER.,O! why stain our holy childhoods? Why sell all for drinks and meats?
691,WALTER.,"Why degrade, like those old mansions, standing in our pauper streets,"
692,WALTER.,"Lodgings _once_ of kings and nobles, silken stirs and trumpet's din,"
693,WALTER.,"_Now_, where crouch 'mong rags and fever, shapes of squalor and of sin?"""
694,WALTER.,"Like a mist this wail surrounds me; Brothers, hush; the Lord Christ's"
695,WALTER.,hands
696,WALTER.,Ev'n now are stretched in blessing o'er the sea and o'er the lands.
697,WALTER.,"Sit not like a mourner, Brother! by the grave of that dear Past,"
698,WALTER.,"Throw the Present! 'tis thy servant only when 'tis overcast,--"
699,WALTER.,"Give battle to the leaguÃ¨d world, if thou'rt worthy, truly brave,"
700,WALTER.,"Thou shalt make the hardest circumstance a helper or a slave,"
701,WALTER.,"As when thunder wraps the setting sun, he struggles, glows with ire,"
702,WALTER.,"Rifts the gloom with golden furrows, with a hundred bursts of fire,"
703,WALTER.,"Melts the black and thund'rous masses to a sphere of rosy light,"
704,WALTER.,Then on edge of glowing heaven smiles in triumph on the night.
705,WALTER.,Lo! the song of Earth--a maniac's on a black and dreary road--
706,WALTER.,"Rises up, and swells, and grandeurs, to the loud triumphal ode--"
707,WALTER.,"Earth casts off a slough of darkness, an eclipse of hell and sin,"
708,WALTER.,"In each cycle of her being, as an adder casts her skin;"

724,WALTER.,With their last gladness filled his dying eyes.
725,WALTER.,No sooner was he hence than critic-worms
726,WALTER.,"Were swarming on the body of his fame,"
727,WALTER.,"And thus they judged the dead: ""This Poet was"

871,WALTER.,"Dies with faint kisses and a murmured joy,"
872,WALTER.,"In the clear blue the lark hangs like a speck,"
873,WALTER.,And empties his full heart of music-rain
874,WALTER.,"O'er sunny slopes, where tender lambkins bleat,"
875,WALTER.,"And new-born rills go laughing to the sea,"
876,WALTER.,"O'er woods that smooth down to the southern shore,"
877,WALTER.,"Waving in green, as the young breezes blow"
878,WALTER.,O'er the sea sphere all sweet and summer smells.
879,WALTER.,"Not of these years, but by-gone minstrel times,"
880,WALTER.,"Of shepherd-days in the young world's sunrise,"
881,WALTER.,"Was this warm clime, this quiet land of health,"
882,WALTER.,"By gentle pagans filled, whose red blood ran"
883,WALTER.,"Healthy and cool as milk,--pure, simple men:"
884,WALTER.,"Ah, how unlike the swelterers in towns!"
885,WALTER.,Who ne'er can glad their eyes upon the green
886,WALTER.,"Sunshine-swathed earth; nor hear the singing rills,"
887,WALTER.,Nor feel the breezes in their lifted hair.
888,WALTER.,
889,WALTER.,"A lovely youth, in manhood's very edge,"
890,WALTER.,Lived 'mong these shepherds and their quiet downs;
891,WALTER.,"Tall and blue-eyed, and bright in golden hair,"
892,WALTER.,"With half-shut dreamy eyes, sweet earnest eyes,"
893,WALTER.,"That seemed unoccupied with outward things,"
894,WALTER.,"Feeding on something richer! Strangely, oft,"
895,WALTER.,A wildered smile lay on his noble lips.
896,WALTER.,The sunburnt shepherds stared with awful eyes
897,WALTER.,"As he went past; and timid girls upstole,"
898,WALTER.,"With wond'ring looks, to gaze upon his face,"
899,WALTER.,"And on his cataract of golden curls,"
900,WALTER.,"Then lonely grew, and went into the woods"
901,WALTER.,"To think sweet thoughts, and marvel why they shook"
902,WALTER.,"With heart-beat and with tremor when he came,"
903,WALTER.,And in the night he filled their dreams with joy.
904,WALTER.,But there was one among that soft-voiced band
905,WALTER.,"Who pined away for love of his sweet eyes,"
906,WALTER.,And died among the roses of the spring.
907,WALTER.,"When Eve sat in the dew with closÃ¨d lids,"
908,WALTER.,Came gentle maidens bearing forest flowers
909,WALTER.,To strew upon her green and quiet grave.
910,WALTER.,They soothed the dead with love-songs low and sweet;
911,WALTER.,"Songs sung of old beneath the purple night,"
912,WALTER.,"Songs heard on earth with heart-beat and a blush,"
913,WALTER.,Songs heard in heaven by the breathless stars.
914,WALTER.,
915,WALTER.,"Thought-wrapt, he wandered in the breezy woods"
916,WALTER.,"In which the Summer, like a hermit, dwelt."
917,WALTER.,"He laid him down by the old haunted springs,"
918,WALTER.,"Up-bubbling 'mid a world of greenery,"
919,WALTER.,"Shut-eyed, and dreaming of the fairest shapes"
920,WALTER.,That roam the woods; and when the autumn nights
921,WALTER.,"Were dark and moonless, to the level sands"
922,WALTER.,"He would betake him, there to hear, o'er-awed,"
923,WALTER.,The old Sea moaning like a monster pained.
924,WALTER.,
925,WALTER.,One day he lay within the pleasant woods
926,WALTER.,"On bed of flowers edging a fountain's brim,"
927,WALTER.,And gazed into its heart as if to count
928,WALTER.,"The veined and lucid pebbles one by one,"
929,WALTER.,Up-shining richly through the crystal clear.
930,WALTER.,"Thus lay he many hours, when, lo! he heard"
931,WALTER.,A maiden singing in the woods alone
932,WALTER.,"A sad and tender island melody,"
933,WALTER.,"Which made a golden conquest of his soul,"
934,WALTER.,Bringing a sadness sweeter than delight.
935,WALTER.,"As nightingale, embowered in vernal leaves,"
936,WALTER.,"Pants out her gladness the luxurious night,"
937,WALTER.,"The moon and stars all hanging on her song,"
938,WALTER.,"She poured her soul in music. When she ceased,"
939,WALTER.,"The charmÃ¨d woods and breezes silent stood,"
940,WALTER.,As if all ear to catch her voice again.
941,WALTER.,"Uprose the dreamer from his couch of flowers,"
942,WALTER.,"With awful expectation in his look,"
943,WALTER.,"And happy tears upon his pallid face,"
944,WALTER.,"With eager steps, as if toward a heaven,"
945,WALTER.,"He onward went, and, lo! he saw her stand,"
946,WALTER.,"Fairer than Dian, in the forest glade."
947,WALTER.,"His footsteps startled her, and quick she turned"
948,WALTER.,"Her face,--looks met like swords. He clasped his hands,"
949,WALTER.,And fell upon his knees; the while there broke
950,WALTER.,A sudden splendour o'er his yearning face;
951,WALTER.,'Twas a pale prayer in its very self.
952,WALTER.,"""I know thee, lovely maiden!"" then he cried;"
953,WALTER.,"""I know thee, and of thee I have been told:"
954,WALTER.,"Been told by all the roses of the vale,"
955,WALTER.,"By hermit streams, by pale sea-setting stars,"
956,WALTER.,And by the roaring of the storm-tost pines;
957,WALTER.,"And I have sought for thee upon the hills,"
958,WALTER.,"In dim sweet dreams, on the complacent sea,"
959,WALTER.,"When breathless midnight, with her thousand hearts,"
960,WALTER.,Beats to the same love-tune as my own heart.
961,WALTER.,"I've waited for thee many seasons through,"
962,WALTER.,Seen many autumns shed their yellow leaves
963,WALTER.,"O'er the oak-roots, heard many winters moan"
964,WALTER.,Through the leafless forests drearily.
965,WALTER.,"Now am I joyful, as storm-battered dove"
966,WALTER.,"That finds a perch in the Hesperides,"
967,WALTER.,"For thou art found. Thou, whom I long have sought,"
968,WALTER.,"My other self! Our blood, our hearts, our souls,"
969,WALTER.,"Shall henceforth mingle in one being, like"
970,WALTER.,The married colours in the bow of heaven.
971,WALTER.,"My soul is like a wide and empty fane,"
972,WALTER.,"Sit thou in 't like a god, O maid divine!"
973,WALTER.,With worship and religion 'twill be filled.
974,WALTER.,"My soul is empty, lorn, and hungry space;"
975,WALTER.,"Leap thou into it like a new-born star,"
976,WALTER.,And 'twill o'erflow with splendour and with bliss.
977,WALTER.,More music! music! music! maid divine!
978,WALTER.,"My hungry senses, like a finch's brood,"
979,WALTER.,"Are all a-gape. O feed them, maid divine!"
980,WALTER.,"Feed, feed my hungry soul with melodies!"""
981,WALTER.,"Thus, like a worshipper before a shrine,"
982,WALTER.,"He earnest syllabled, and, rising up,"
983,WALTER.,He led that lovely stranger tenderly
984,WALTER.,Through the green forest toward the burning west.
985,WALTER.,"He never, by the maidens of the isle"
986,WALTER.,"Nor by the shepherds, was thereafter seen"
987,WALTER.,"'Mong sunrise splendours on the misty hills,"
988,WALTER.,"Or stretched at noon by the old haunted wells,"
989,WALTER.,Or by the level sands on autumn nights.
990,WALTER.,
991,WALTER.,I've heard that maidens have been won by song.
992,WALTER.,"O Poesy, fine sprite! I'd bless thee more"
993,WALTER.,"If thou would'st bring that lady's love to me,"
994,WALTER.,Than immortality in twenty worlds.
995,WALTER.,"I'd rather win her than God's youngest star,"
996,WALTER.,With singing continents and seas of bliss.----
997,WALTER.,"Thou day beyond to-morrow, haste thee on!"

1003,SCENE IV.,
1004,LADY.,LADY.
1005,LADY.,
1006,LADY.,The stream of sunsets?
1007,LADY.,
1008,WALTER.,WALTER.
1009,WALTER.,
1010,WALTER.,'Tis that loveliest stream.
1011,WALTER.,I've learned by heart its sweet and devious course
1012,WALTER.,"By frequent tracing, as a lover learns"
1013,WALTER.,The features of his best-beloved's face.
1014,WALTER.,"In memory it runs, a shining thread,"
1015,WALTER.,"With sunsets strung upon it thick, like pearls."
1016,WALTER.,From yonder trees I've seen the western sky
1017,WALTER.,"All washed with fire, while, in the midst, the sun"
1018,WALTER.,"Beat like a pulse, welling at ev'ry beat"
1019,WALTER.,A spreading wave of light. Where yonder church
1020,WALTER.,"Stands up to heaven, as if to intercede"
1021,WALTER.,"For sinful hamlets scattered at its feet,"
1022,WALTER.,"I saw the dreariest sight. The sun was down,"
1023,WALTER.,And all the west was paved with sullen fire.
1024,WALTER.,"I cried, ""Behold! the barren beach of hell"
1025,WALTER.,"At ebb of tide."" The ghost of one bright hour"
1026,WALTER.,Comes from its grave and stands before me now.
1027,WALTER.,"'Twas at the close of a long summer day,"
1028,WALTER.,"As we were sitting on yon grassy slope,"
1029,WALTER.,The sunset hung before us like a dream
1030,WALTER.,That shakes a demon in his fiery lair;
1031,WALTER.,The clouds were standing round the setting sun
1032,WALTER.,"Like gaping caves, fantastic pinnacles,"
1033,WALTER.,"Citadels throbbing in their own fierce light,"
1034,WALTER.,"Tall spires that came and went like spires of flame,"
1035,WALTER.,"Cliffs quivering with fire-snow, and peaks"
1036,WALTER.,"Of pilÃ¨d gorgeousness, and rocks of fire"
1037,WALTER.,"A-tilt and poised, bare beaches, crimson seas,"
1038,WALTER.,"All these were huddled in that dreadful west,"
1039,WALTER.,"All shook and trembled in unsteadfast light,"
1040,WALTER.,"And from the centre blazed the angry sun,"
1041,WALTER.,Stern as the unlashed eye of God a-glare
1042,WALTER.,O'er evening city with its boom of sin.
1043,WALTER.,"I do remember, as we journeyed home,"
1044,WALTER.,"(That dreadful sunset burnt into our brains),"
1045,WALTER.,With what a soothing came the naked moon.
1046,WALTER.,"She, like a swimmer who has found his ground,"
1047,WALTER.,"Came rippling up a silver strand of cloud,"
1048,WALTER.,And plunged from the other side into the night.
1049,WALTER.,"I and that friend, the feeder of my soul,"
1050,WALTER.,"Did wander up and down these banks for years,"
1051,WALTER.,"Talking of blessed hopes and holy faiths,"
1052,WALTER.,How sin and weeping all should pass away
1053,WALTER.,In the calm sunshine of the earth's old age.
1054,WALTER.,"Breezes are blowing in old Chaucer's verse,"
1055,WALTER.,'Twas here we drank them. Here for hours we hung
1056,WALTER.,O'er the fine pants and trembles of a line.
1057,WALTER.,"Oft, standing on a hill's green head, we felt"
1058,WALTER.,"Breezes of love, and joy, and melody,"
1059,WALTER.,"Blow through us, as the winds blow through the sky."
1060,WALTER.,Oft with our souls in our eyes all day we fed
1061,WALTER.,"On summer landscapes, silver-veined with streams,"
1062,WALTER.,O'er which the air hung silent in its joy--
1063,WALTER.,"With a great city lying in its smoke,"
1064,WALTER.,A monster sleeping in its own thick breath;
1065,WALTER.,"And surgy plains of wheat, and ancient woods,"
1066,WALTER.,"In the calm evenings cawed by clouds of rooks,"
1067,WALTER.,"Acres of moss, and long black strips of firs,"
1068,WALTER.,"And sweet cots dropt in green, where children played"
1069,WALTER.,"To us unheard, till, gradual, all was lost"
1070,WALTER.,"In distance-haze to a blue rim of hills,"
1071,WALTER.,Upon whose heads came down the closing sky.
1072,WALTER.,Beneath the crescent moon on autumn nights
1073,WALTER.,"We paced its banks with overflowing hearts,"
1074,WALTER.,"Discoursing long of great thought-wealthy souls,"
1075,WALTER.,And with what spendthrift hands they scatter wide
1076,WALTER.,"Their spirit-wealth, making mankind their debtors:"
1077,WALTER.,"Affluent spirits, dropt from the teeming stars,"
1078,WALTER.,"Who come before their time, are starved, and die,"
1079,WALTER.,Like swallows that arrive before the summer.
1080,WALTER.,"Or haply talked of dearer personal themes,"
1081,WALTER.,Blind guesses at each other's after fate;
1082,WALTER.,"Feeling our leaping hearts, we marvelled oft"
1083,WALTER.,"How they should be unleashed, and have free course"
1084,WALTER.,To stretch and strain far down the coming time--
1085,WALTER.,But in our guesses never was the _grave_.
1086,WALTER.,
1087,LADY.,LADY.
1088,LADY.,
1089,LADY.,The tale! the tale! the tale! As empty halls
1090,LADY.,"Gape for a coming pageant, my fond ears"
1091,LADY.,To take its music are all eager-wide.
1092,LADY.,
1093,WALTER.,WALTER.
1094,WALTER.,
1095,WALTER.,"Within yon grove of beeches is a well,"

1097,WALTER.,
1098,LADY.,LADY.
1099,LADY.,
1100,LADY.,"As I suppose, by way of recompense,"

1102,LADY.,
1103,WALTER.,WALTER.
1104,WALTER.,
1105,WALTER.,Memories grow around it thick as flow
1106,WALTER.,That well is loved and haunted by a star.
1107,WALTER.,The live-long day her clear and patient eye
1108,WALTER.,"Is open on the soft and bending blue,"
1109,WALTER.,Just where she lost her lover in the morn.
1110,WALTER.,But with the night the star creeps o'er the trees
1111,WALTER.,"And smiles upon her, and some happy hours"
1112,WALTER.,She holds his image in her crystal heart.
1113,WALTER.,Beside that well I read the mighty Bard
1114,WALTER.,"Who clad himself with beauty, genius, wealth,"
1115,WALTER.,Then flung himself on his own passion-pyre
1116,WALTER.,And was consumed. Beside that lucid well
1117,WALTER.,The whitest lilies grow for many miles.
1118,WALTER.,"'Tis said that, 'mong the flowers of perished years,"
1119,WALTER.,"A prince woo'd here a lady of the land,"
1120,WALTER.,"And when with faltering lips he told his love,"
1121,WALTER.,Into her proud face leapt her prouder blood;
1122,WALTER.,"She struck him blind with scorn, then with an air"
1123,WALTER.,"As if she wore the crowns of all the world,"
1124,WALTER.,She swept right on and left him in the dew.
1125,WALTER.,"Again he sat at even with his love,"
1126,WALTER.,He sent a song into her haughty ears
1127,WALTER.,"To plead for him;--she listened, still he sang."
1128,WALTER.,"Tears, drawn by music, were upon her face,"
1129,WALTER.,"Till on its trembling close, to which she clung"
1130,WALTER.,"Like dying wretch to life, with a low cry"
1131,WALTER.,"She flung her arms around him, told her love,"
1132,WALTER.,"And how she long had loved him, but had kept"
1133,WALTER.,"It in her heart, like one who has a gem"
1134,WALTER.,"And hoards it up in some most secret place,"
1135,WALTER.,While he who owns it seeks it and with tears.
1136,WALTER.,Won by the sweet omnipotence of song!
1137,WALTER.,He gave her lands! she paid him with herself.
1138,WALTER.,"Brow-bound with gold she sat, the fairest thing"
1139,WALTER.,Within his sea-washed shores.
1140,WALTER.,
1141,LADY.,LADY.
1142,LADY.,
1143,LADY.,Most fit reward!
1144,LADY.,A poet's love should ever thus be paid.

1148,WALTER.,Ha! Dost thou think so?

1154,WALTER.,WALTER.
1155,WALTER.,
1156,WALTER.,"On balcony, all summer roofed with vines,"
1157,WALTER.,"A lady half-reclined amid the light,"
1158,WALTER.,"Golden and green, soft-showering through the leaves,"
1159,WALTER.,Silent she sat one-half the silent noon;
1160,WALTER.,"At last she sank luxurious in her couch,"
1161,WALTER.,"Purple and golden-fringÃ¨d, like the sun's,"
1162,WALTER.,"And stretched her white arms on the warmÃ¨d air,"
1163,WALTER.,As if to take some object wherewithal
1164,WALTER.,To ease the empty aching of her heart.
1165,WALTER.,"""Oh, what a weariness of life is mine!"""
1166,WALTER.,"The lady said, ""soothing myself to sleep"
1167,WALTER.,"With my own lute, floating about the lake"
1168,WALTER.,"To feed my swans; with nought to stir my blood,"
1169,WALTER.,Unless I scold my women thrice a-day.
1170,WALTER.,Unwrought yet in the tapestry of my life
1171,WALTER.,Are princely suitors kneeling evermore.
1172,WALTER.,"I, in my beauty, standing in the midst,"
1173,WALTER.,"Touching them, careless, with most stately eyes."
1174,WALTER.,"Oh, I could love, methinks, with all my soul!"
1175,WALTER.,But I see nought to love; nought save some score
1176,WALTER.,"Of lisping, curl'd gallants, with words i' their mouths"
1177,WALTER.,"Soft as their mothers' milk. Oh, empty heart!"
1178,WALTER.,"Oh, palace, rich and purple-chambered!"
1179,WALTER.,When will thy lord come home?
1180,WALTER.,
1181,WALTER.,"""When the grey morn was groping 'bout the east"
1182,WALTER.,The Earl went trooping forth to chase the stag;
1183,WALTER.,"I trust he hath not, to the sport he loves"
1184,WALTER.,"Better than ale-bouts, ta'en my cub of Ind."
1185,WALTER.,My sweetest plaything. He is bright and wild
1186,WALTER.,"As is a gleaming panther of the hills,--"
1187,WALTER.,"Lovely as lightning, beautiful as wild!"
1188,WALTER.,His sports and laughters are with fierceness edged;
1189,WALTER.,"There's something in his beauty all untamed,"
1190,WALTER.,"As I were toying with a naked sword,"
1191,WALTER.,Which starts within my veins the blood of earls.
1192,WALTER.,I fain would have the service of his voice
1193,WALTER.,"To kill with music this most languid noon."""
1194,WALTER.,She rang a silver bell: with downcast eyes
1195,WALTER.,The tawny nursling of the Indian sun
1196,WALTER.,"Stood at her feet. ""I pr'ythee, Leopard, sing;"
1197,WALTER.,"Give me some stormy song of sword and lance,"
1198,WALTER.,"Which, rushing upward from a hero's heart,"
1199,WALTER.,"Straight rose upon a hundred leaguered hills,"
1200,WALTER.,Ragged and wild as pyramid of flame.
1201,WALTER.,"Or, better, sing some hungry lay of love"
1202,WALTER.,Like that you sang me on the eve you told
1203,WALTER.,How poor our English to your Indian darks;
1204,WALTER.,"Shaken from od'rous hills, what tender smells"
1205,WALTER.,Pass like fine pulses through the mellow nights;
1206,WALTER.,"The purple ether that embathes the moon,--"
1207,WALTER.,"Your large round moon, more beautiful than ours;"
1208,WALTER.,"Your showers of stars, each hanging luminous,"
1209,WALTER.,"Like golden dewdrops in the Indian air."""
1210,WALTER.,"""I know a song, born in the heart of love,"
1211,WALTER.,"Its sweetest sweet, steeped ere the close in tears."
1212,WALTER.,'Twas sung into the cold ears of the stars
1213,WALTER.,Beside the murmured margent of the sea.
1214,WALTER.,"'Tis of two lovers, matched like cymbals fine,"
1215,WALTER.,"Who, in a moment of luxurious blood,"
1216,WALTER.,"Their pale lips trembling in the kiss of gods,"
1217,WALTER.,"Made their lives wine-cups, and then drank them off,"
1218,WALTER.,And died with beings full-blown like a rose;
1219,WALTER.,"A mighty heart-pant bore them like a wave,"
1220,WALTER.,"And flung them, flowers, upon the next world's strand."
1221,WALTER.,
1222,WALTER.,"Night the solemn, night the starry,"
1223,WALTER.,'Mong the oak-trees old and gnarry;
1224,WALTER.,"By the sea-shore and the ships,"
1225,WALTER.,'Neath the stars I sat with Clari;
1226,WALTER.,"Her silken bodice was unlaced,"
1227,WALTER.,"My arm was trembling round her waist,"
1228,WALTER.,I plucked the joys upon her lips;
1229,WALTER.,Joys that plucked still grow again!
1230,WALTER.,"Canst thou say the same, old Night?"
1231,WALTER.,Ha! thy life is vain.
1232,WALTER.,
1233,WALTER.,"Oh, that death would let me tarry"
1234,WALTER.,"Like a dewdrop on a flower,"
1235,WALTER.,Ever on those lips of Clari!
1236,WALTER.,"Our beings mellow, then they fall,"
1237,WALTER.,Like o'er-ripe peaches from the wall;
1238,WALTER.,"We ripen, drop, and all is o'er;"
1239,WALTER.,On the cold grave weeps the rain;
1240,WALTER.,"I weep it should be so, old Night."
1241,WALTER.,Ah! my tears are vain.
1242,WALTER.,
1243,WALTER.,"Night the solemn, night the starry,"
1244,WALTER.,"Say, alas! that years should harry"
1245,WALTER.,"Gloss from life and joy from lips,"
1246,WALTER.,Love-lustre from the eyes of Clari!
1247,WALTER.,"Moon! that walkest the blue deep,"
1248,WALTER.,Like naked maiden in her sleep;
1249,WALTER.,Star! whose pallid splendour dips
1250,WALTER.,In the ghost-waves of the main.
1251,WALTER.,"Oh, ye hear me not! old Night,"
1252,WALTER.,"My tears and cries are vain."""
1253,WALTER.,
1254,WALTER.,"He ceased to sing; queenly the lady lay,"
1255,WALTER.,One white hand hidden in a golden shoal
1256,WALTER.,"Of ringlets, reeling down upon her couch,"
1257,WALTER.,"And heaving on the heavings of her breast,"
1258,WALTER.,"The while the thoughts rose in her eyes like stars,"
1259,WALTER.,Rising and setting in the blue of night.
1260,WALTER.,"""I had a cousin once,"" the lady said,"
1261,WALTER.,"""Who brooding sat, a melancholy owl,"
1262,WALTER.,Among the twilight-branches of his thoughts.
1263,WALTER.,"He was a rhymer, and great knights he spoiled,"
1264,WALTER.,"And damsels saved, and giants slew--in verse."
1265,WALTER.,"He died in youth; his heart held a dead hope,"
1266,WALTER.,As holds the wretched west the sunset's corpse:
1267,WALTER.,"He went to his grave, nor told what man he was."
1268,WALTER.,"He was unlanguaged, like the earnest sea,"
1269,WALTER.,"Which strives to gain an utterance on the shore,"
1270,WALTER.,But ne'er can shape unto the listening hills
1271,WALTER.,The lore it gathered in its awful age;
1272,WALTER.,The crime for which 'tis lashed by cruel winds;
1273,WALTER.,"The thought, pain, grief, within its labouring breast."
1274,WALTER.,"To fledge with music, wings of heavy noon,"
1275,WALTER.,I'll sing some verses that he sent to me:--
1276,WALTER.,
1277,WALTER.,"Where the west has sunset-bloomed,"
1278,WALTER.,"Where a hero's heart is tombed,"
1279,WALTER.,"Where a thunder-cloud has gloomed,"
1280,WALTER.,
1281,WALTER.,"Seen, becomes a part of me."
1282,WALTER.,Flowers and rills live sunnily
1283,WALTER.,In gardens of my memory.
1284,WALTER.,
1285,WALTER.,"Through its walks and leafy lanes,"
1286,WALTER.,Float fair shapes 'mong sunlight rains;
1287,WALTER.,Blood is running in their veins.
1288,WALTER.,
1289,WALTER.,"One, a queenly maiden fair,"
1290,WALTER.,"Sweepeth past me with an air,"
1291,WALTER.,Kings might kneel beneath her stare.
1292,WALTER.,
1293,WALTER.,"Round her heart, a rosebud free,"
1294,WALTER.,"Reeled I, like a drunken bee;"
1295,WALTER.,Alas! it would not ope to me.
1296,WALTER.,
1297,WALTER.,"One comes shining like a saint,"
1298,WALTER.,"But her face I cannot paint,"
1299,WALTER.,For mine eyes and blood grow faint.
1300,WALTER.,
1301,WALTER.,"Eyes are dimmed as by a tear,"
1302,WALTER.,"Sounds are ringing in mine ear,"
1303,WALTER.,"I feel only, she is here,"
1304,WALTER.,
1305,WALTER.,"That she laugheth where she stands,"
1306,WALTER.,That she mocketh with her hands;
1307,WALTER.,I am bound in tighter bands.
1308,WALTER.,
1309,WALTER.,"Laid 'mong faintest blooms is one,"
1310,WALTER.,"Singing in the setting sun,"
1311,WALTER.,And her song is never done.
1312,WALTER.,
1313,WALTER.,She was born 'mong water-mills;
1314,WALTER.,"She grew up 'mong flowers and rills,"
1315,WALTER.,In the hearts of distant hills.
1316,WALTER.,
1317,WALTER.,"There, into her being stole"
1318,WALTER.,"Nature, and embued the whole,"
1319,WALTER.,And illumed her face and soul.
1320,WALTER.,
1321,WALTER.,She grew fairer than her peers;
1322,WALTER.,Still her gentle forehead wears
1323,WALTER.,Holy lights of infant years.
1324,WALTER.,
1325,WALTER.,"Her blue eyes, so mild and meek,"
1326,WALTER.,"She uplifteth, when I speak,"
1327,WALTER.,Lo! the blushes mount her cheek.
1328,WALTER.,
1329,WALTER.,"Weary I of pride and jest,"
1330,WALTER.,"In this rich heart I would rest,"
1331,WALTER.,Purple and love-linÃ¨d nest.
1332,WALTER.,
1333,WALTER.,"""My dazzling panther of the smoking hills,"
1334,WALTER.,"When the hot sun hath touched their loads of dew,"
1335,WALTER.,"What strange eyes had my cousin, who could thus"
1336,WALTER.,(For you must know I am the first o' the three
1337,WALTER.,That pace the gardens of his memory)
1338,WALTER.,"Prefer before the daughter of great earls,"
1339,WALTER.,"This giglot, shining in her golden hair,"
1340,WALTER.,Haunting him like a gleam or happy thought;
1341,WALTER.,"Or her, the last, up whose cheeks blushes went"
1342,WALTER.,As thick and frequent as the streamers pass
1343,WALTER.,"Up cold December nights. True, she might be"
1344,WALTER.,"A dainty partner in the game of lips,"
1345,WALTER.,"Sweet'ning the honeymoon; but what, alas!"
1346,WALTER.,When redhot youth cools down to iron man?
1347,WALTER.,"Could her white fingers close a helmet up,"
1348,WALTER.,"And send her lord unkissed away to field,"
1349,WALTER.,Her heart striking with his arm in every blow?
1350,WALTER.,"Would joy rush through her spirit like a stream,"
1351,WALTER.,When to her lips he came with victory back:
1352,WALTER.,"Acclaims and blessings on his head like crowns,"
1353,WALTER.,"His mouthÃ¨d wounds brave trumpets in his praise,"
1354,WALTER.,"Drawing huge shoals of people, like the moon,"
1355,WALTER.,Whose beauty draws the solemn-noisÃ¨d seas?
1356,WALTER.,Or would his bright and lovely sanguine-stains
1357,WALTER.,"Scare all the coward blood into her heart,"
1358,WALTER.,Leaving her cheeks as pale as lily leaves?
1359,WALTER.,"And at his great step would she quail and faint,"
1360,WALTER.,And pay his seeking arms with bloodless swoon?
1361,WALTER.,"My heart would leap to greet such coming lord,"
1362,WALTER.,"Eager to meet him, tiptoe on my lips."""
1363,WALTER.,
1364,WALTER.,"""This cousin loved the Lady Constance; did"
1365,WALTER.,"The Lady Constance love her cousin, too?"""
1366,WALTER.,
1367,WALTER.,"""Ay, as a cousin. He woo'd me, Leopard mine,"
1368,WALTER.,I speared him with a jest; for there are men
1369,WALTER.,"Whose sinews stiffen 'gainst a knitted brow,"
1370,WALTER.,"Yet are unthreaded, loosened by a sneer,"
1371,WALTER.,And their resolve doth pass as doth a wave:
1372,WALTER.,"Of this sort was my cousin. I saw him once,"
1373,WALTER.,"Adown a pleachÃ¨d alley, in the sun,"
1374,WALTER.,Two gorgeous peacocks pecking from his hand;
1375,WALTER.,"At sight of me he first turned red, then pale."
1376,WALTER.,"I laughed and said, 'I saw a misery perched"
1377,WALTER.,"I' the melancholy corners of his mouth,"
1378,WALTER.,Like griffins on each side my father's gates.'
1379,WALTER.,"And, 'That by sighing he would win my heart,"
1380,WALTER.,"Somewhere as soon as he could hug the earth,"
1381,WALTER.,And crack its golden ribs.' A week the boy
1382,WALTER.,"Dwelt in his sorrow, like a cataract"
1383,WALTER.,"Unseen, yet sounding through its shrouding mists."
1384,WALTER.,"Strange likings, too, this cousin had of mine."
1385,WALTER.,"A frail cloud trailing o'er the midnight moon,"
1386,WALTER.,Was lovelier sight than wounded boar a-foam
1387,WALTER.,"Among the yelping dogs. He'd lie in fields,"
1388,WALTER.,"And through his fingers watch the changing clouds,"
1389,WALTER.,"Those playful fancies of the mighty sky,"
1390,WALTER.,With deeper interest than a lady's face.
1391,WALTER.,"He had no heart to grasp the fleeting hour,"
1392,WALTER.,"Which, like a thief, steals by with silent foot,"
1393,WALTER.,In his closed hand the jewel of a life.
1394,WALTER.,He scarce would match this throned and kingdom'd earth
1395,WALTER.,Against a dew drop.
1396,WALTER.,
1397,WALTER.,"""Who'd leap into the chariot of my heart,"
1398,WALTER.,"And seize the reins, and wind it to his will,"
1399,WALTER.,"Must be of other stuff, my cub of Ind;"
1400,WALTER.,"White honour shall be like a plaything to him,"
1401,WALTER.,"Borne lightly, a pet falcon on his wrist;"
1402,WALTER.,"One who can feel the very pulse o' the time,"
1403,WALTER.,"Instant to act, to plunge into the strife,"
1404,WALTER.,And with a strong arm hold the rearing world.
1405,WALTER.,"In costly chambers hushed with carpets rich,"
1406,WALTER.,"Swept by proud beauties in their whistling silks,"
1407,WALTER.,Mars' plait shall smooth to sweetness on his brow;
1408,WALTER.,"His mighty front whose steel flung back the sun,"
1409,WALTER.,"When horsed for battle, shall bend above a hand"
1410,WALTER.,"Laid like a lily in his tawny palm,"
1411,WALTER.,With such a grace as takes the gazer's eye.
1412,WALTER.,"His voice that shivered the mad trumpet's blare,--"
1413,WALTER.,"A new-raised standard to the reeling field,--"
1414,WALTER.,"Shall know to tremble at a lady's ear,"
1415,WALTER.,"To charm her blood with the fine touch of praise,"
1416,WALTER.,And as she listens--steal away the heart.
1417,WALTER.,"If the good gods do grant me such a man,"
1418,WALTER.,"More would I dote upon his trenchÃ¨d brows,"
1419,WALTER.,"His coal-black hair, proud eyes, and scornful lips,"
1420,WALTER.,"Than on a gallant, curled like Absalom,"
1421,WALTER.,"Cheek'd like Apollo, with his luted voice."
1422,WALTER.,
1423,WALTER.,"""Canst tell me, Sir Dark-eyes,"
1424,WALTER.,"Is 't true what these strange-thoughted poets say,"
1425,WALTER.,That hearts are tangled in a golden smile?
1426,WALTER.,That brave cheeks pale before a queenly brow?
1427,WALTER.,That mail'd knees bend beneath a lighted eye?
1428,WALTER.,That trickling tears are deadlier than swords?
1429,WALTER.,That with our full-mooned beauty we can slave
1430,WALTER.,"Spirits that walk time, like the travelling sun,"
1431,WALTER.,With sunset glories girt around his loins?
1432,WALTER.,That love can thrive upon such dainty food
1433,WALTER.,"As sweet words, showering from a rosy lip,"
1434,WALTER.,"As sighs, and smiles, and tears, and kisses warm?"""
1435,WALTER.,The dark Page lifted up his Indian eyes
1436,WALTER.,"To that bright face, and saw it all a-smile;"
1437,WALTER.,"And then half grave, half jestingly, he said,--"
1438,WALTER.,"""The devil fisheth best for souls of men"
1439,WALTER.,When his hook is baited with a lovely limb;
1440,WALTER.,"Love lights upon the heart, and straight we feel"
1441,WALTER.,"More worlds of wealth gleam in an upturned eye,"
1442,WALTER.,Than in the rich heart of the miser sea.
1443,WALTER.,Beauty hath made our greatest manhoods weak.
1444,WALTER.,"There have been men who chafed, leapt on their times,"
1445,WALTER.,And reined them in as gallants rein their steeds
1446,WALTER.,"To curvetings, to show their sweep of limb;"
1447,WALTER.,Yet love hath on their broad brows written 'fool.'
1448,WALTER.,"Sages, with passions held in leash like hounds;"
1449,WALTER.,"Grave Doctors, tilting with a lance of light"
1450,WALTER.,"In lists of argument, have knelt and sighed"
1451,WALTER.,"Most plethoric sighs, and been but very men;"
1452,WALTER.,"Stern hearts, close barred against a wanton world,"
1453,WALTER.,Have had their gates burst open by a kiss.
1454,WALTER.,"Why, there was one who might have topped all men,"
1455,WALTER.,Who bartered joyously for a single smile
1456,WALTER.,"This empired planet with its load of crowns,"
1457,WALTER.,"And thought himself enriched. If ye are fair,"
1458,WALTER.,Mankind will crowd around you thick as when
1459,WALTER.,"The full-faced moon sits silver on the sea,"
1460,WALTER.,"The eager waves lift up their gleaming heads,"
1461,WALTER.,"Each shouldering for her smile."""
1462,WALTER.,
1463,WALTER.,"The lady dowered him with her richest look,"
1464,WALTER.,"Her arch head half aside, her liquid eyes,"
1465,WALTER.,"From 'neath their dim lids drooping slumberous,"
1466,WALTER.,"Stood full on his, and called the wild blood up"
1467,WALTER.,"All in a tumult to his sun-kissed cheek,"
1468,WALTER.,As if it wished to see her beauty too--
1469,WALTER.,"Then asked in dulcet tones, ""Dost think _me_ fair?"""
1470,WALTER.,"""Oh, thou art fairer than an Indian morn,"
1471,WALTER.,Seated in her sheen palace of the east.
1472,WALTER.,Thy faintest smile out-prices the swelled wombs
1473,WALTER.,"Of fleets, rich-glutted, toiling wearily"
1474,WALTER.,To vomit all their wealth on English strands.
1475,WALTER.,The whiteness of this hand should ne'er receive
1476,WALTER.,A poorer greeting than the kiss of kings;
1477,WALTER.,"And on thy happy lips doth sit a joy,"
1478,WALTER.,"Fuller than any gathered by the gods,"
1479,WALTER.,"In all the rich range of their golden heaven."""
1480,WALTER.,"""Now, by my mother's white enskied soul!"""
1481,WALTER.,"The lady cried, 'twixt laugh and blush the while,"
1482,WALTER.,"""I'll swear thou'st been in love, my Indian sweet."
1483,WALTER.,"Thy spirit on another breaks in joy,"
1484,WALTER.,Like the pleased sea on a white-breasted shore--
1485,WALTER.,"That blush tells tales. And now, I swear by all"
1486,WALTER.,"The well-washed jewels strewn on fathom-sands,"
1487,WALTER.,"That thou dost keep her looks, her words, her sighs,"
1488,WALTER.,"Her laughs, her tears, her angers, and her frowns,"
1489,WALTER.,Balmed between memory's leaves; and ev'ry day
1490,WALTER.,"Dost count them o'er and o'er in solitude,"
1491,WALTER.,As pious monks count o'er their rosaries.
1492,WALTER.,"Now, tell me, did she give thee love for love?"
1493,WALTER.,"Or didst thou make Midnight thy confidant,"
1494,WALTER.,"Telling her all about thy lady's eyes,"
1495,WALTER.,"How rich her cheek, how cold as death her scorn?"
1496,WALTER.,"My lustrous Leopard, hast thou been in love?"""
1497,WALTER.,The Page's dark face flushed the hue of wine
1498,WALTER.,In crystal goblet stricken by the sun;
1499,WALTER.,"His soul stood like a moon within his eyes,"
1500,WALTER.,Suddenly orbed; his passionate voice was shook
1501,WALTER.,"By trembling into music.--""Thee I love."""
1502,WALTER.,"""Thou!"" and the Lady, with a cruel laugh,"
1503,WALTER.,"(Each silver throb went through him like a sword,)"
1504,WALTER.,Flung herself back upon her fringÃ¨d couch.
1505,WALTER.,"From which she rose upon him like a queen,"
1506,WALTER.,She rose and stabbed him with her angry eyes.
1507,WALTER.,"""'Tis well my father did not hear thee, boy,"
1508,WALTER.,Or else my pretty plaything of an hour
1509,WALTER.,"Might have gone sleep to-night without his head,"
1510,WALTER.,And I might waste rich tears upon his fate.
1511,WALTER.,I would not have my sweetest plaything hurt.
1512,WALTER.,"Dost think to scorch me with those blazing eyes,"
1513,WALTER.,My fierce and lightning-blooded cub o' the sun?
1514,WALTER.,"Thy blood is up in riot on thy brow,"
1515,WALTER.,"I' the face o' its monarch. Peace! By my grey sire,"
1516,WALTER.,"Now could I slay thee with one look of hate,"
1517,WALTER.,One single look! My Hero! my Heart-god!
1518,WALTER.,"My dusk Hyperion, Bacchus of the Inds!"
1519,WALTER.,"My Hercules, with chin as smooth as my own!"
1520,WALTER.,"I am so sorry maid, I cannot wear"
1521,WALTER.,This great and proffered jewel of thy love.
1522,WALTER.,"Thou art too bold, methinks! Didst never fear"
1523,WALTER.,That on my poor deserts thy love would sit
1524,WALTER.,Like a great diamond on a threadbare robe?
1525,WALTER.,"I tremble for 't. I pr'ythee, come to-morrow"
1526,WALTER.,And I will pasture you upon my lips
1527,WALTER.,"Until thy beard be grown. Go now, sir, go."""
1528,WALTER.,"As thence she waved him with arm-sweep superb,"
1529,WALTER.,"The light of scorn was cold within her eyes,"
1530,WALTER.,"And withered his bloom'd heart, which, like a rose,"
1531,WALTER.,"Had opened, timid, to the noon of love."
1532,WALTER.,
1533,WALTER.,"The lady sank again into her couch,"
1534,WALTER.,Panting and flushed; slowly she paled with thought;
1535,WALTER.,"When she looked up the sun had sunk an hour,"
1536,WALTER.,And one round star shook in the orange west.
1537,WALTER.,"The lady sighed, ""It was my father's blood"
1538,WALTER.,"That bore me, as a red and wrathful stream"
1539,WALTER.,"Bears a shed leaf. I would recall my words,"
1540,WALTER.,And yet I would not.
1541,WALTER.,Into what angry beauty rushed his face!
1542,WALTER.,What lips! what splendid eyes! 'twas pitiful
1543,WALTER.,To see such splendours ebb in utter woe.
1544,WALTER.,His eyes half-won me. Tush! I am a fool;
1545,WALTER.,"The blood that purples in these azure veins,"
1546,WALTER.,"Rich'd with its long course through a hundred earls,"
1547,WALTER.,Were fouled and mudded if I stooped to him.
1548,WALTER.,My father loves him for his free wild wit;
1549,WALTER.,I for his beauty and sun-lighted eyes.
1550,WALTER.,"To bring him to my feet, to kiss my hand,"
1551,WALTER.,"Had I it in my gift, I'd give the world,"
1552,WALTER.,"Its panting fire-heart, diamonds, veins of gold;"
1553,WALTER.,"Its rich strands, oceans, belts of cedared hills,"
1554,WALTER.,Whence summer smells are struck by all the winds.
1555,WALTER.,But whether I might lance him through the brain
1556,WALTER.,"With a proud look,--or whether sternly kill"
1557,WALTER.,"Him with a single deadly word of scorn,--"
1558,WALTER.,"Or whether yield me up,"
1559,WALTER.,"And sink all tears and weakness in his arms,"
1560,WALTER.,And strike him blind with a strong shock of joy--
1561,WALTER.,Alas! I feel I could do each and all.
1562,WALTER.,"I will be kind when next he brings me flowers,"
1563,WALTER.,"Plucked from the shining forehead of the morn,"
1564,WALTER.,Ere they have oped their rich cores to the bee.
1565,WALTER.,"His wild heart with a ringlet will I chain,"
1566,WALTER.,"And o'er him I will lean me like a heaven,"
1567,WALTER.,"And feed him with sweet looks and dew-soft words,"
1568,WALTER.,"And beauty that might make a monarch pale,"
1569,WALTER.,And thrill him to the heart's core with a touch;
1570,WALTER.,"Smile him to Paradise at close of eve,"
1571,WALTER.,"To hang upon my lips in silver dreams."""
1572,WALTER.,
1573,LADY.,LADY.
1574,LADY.,
1575,LADY.,"What, art thou done already? Thy tale is like"
1576,LADY.,A day unsealed with sunset. What though dusk?

1587,WALTER.,O may my spirit on hope's ladder climb
1588,WALTER.,"From hungry nothing up to star-packed space,"
1589,WALTER.,Thence strain on tip-toe to thy love beyond--
1590,WALTER.,The only heaven I ask!

1600,WALTER.,
1601,WALTER.,What dost thou murmur?
1602,WALTER.,Thy cheeks burn mad as mine. O untouched lips!
1603,WALTER.,I see them as a glorious rebel sees
1604,WALTER.,A crown within his reach. I'll taste their bliss
1605,WALTER.,Although the price be death----

1607,WALTER.,LADY (_springing up_).
1608,WALTER.,
1609,WALTER.,Walter! beware!
1610,WALTER.,These tell-tale heavens are list'ning earnestly.
1611,WALTER.,O Sir! within a month my bridal bells
1612,WALTER.,Will make a village glad. The fainting Earth
1613,WALTER.,"Is bleeding at her million golden veins,"
1614,WALTER.,And by her blood I'm bought. The sun shall see
1615,WALTER.,"A pale bride wedded to grey hair, and eyes"
1616,WALTER.,Of cold and cruel blue; and in the spring
1617,WALTER.,A grave with daisies on it.               [_A pause._
1618,WALTER.,O my friend!
1619,WALTER.,"We twain have met like ships upon the sea,"
1620,WALTER.,"Who hold an hour's converse, so short, so sweet;"
1621,WALTER.,"One little hour! and then, away they speed"
1622,WALTER.,"On lonely paths, through mist, and cloud, and foam,"
1623,WALTER.,"To meet no more. We have been foolish, Walter!"
1624,WALTER.,I would to God that I had never known
1625,WALTER.,"This secret of thy heart, or else had met thee"
1626,WALTER.,Years before this. I bear a heavy doom.
1627,WALTER.,"If thy rich heart is like a palace shattered,"
1628,WALTER.,"Stand up amid the ruins of thy heart,"
1629,WALTER.,And with a calm brow front the solemn stars.
1630,WALTER.,[LADY _pauses;_ WALTER _remains silent._
1631,WALTER.,"'Tis four o'clock already. She, the moon,"

1634,WALTER.,"So let thy soul be up and ready armed,"
1635,WALTER.,In waiting till occasion comes like night;
1636,WALTER.,As night to moons to souls occasion comes.
1637,WALTER.,"I am thine elder, WALTER! in the heart,"
1638,WALTER.,I read thy future like an open book:
1639,WALTER.,I see thou shalt have grief; I also see
1640,WALTER.,Thy grief's edge blunted on the iron world.
1641,WALTER.,"Be brave and strong through all thy wrestling years,"
1642,WALTER.,A brave soul is a thing which all things serve;
1643,WALTER.,"When the great Corsican from Elba came,"

1646,WALTER.,"He spoke--they broke their ranks, they clasped his knees,"

1668,WALTER.,"If memory shall ever lead thee there,"
1669,WALTER.,Through daisies I'll look up into thy face

1692,WALTER.,Night mounts her chariot in the eastern glooms
1693,WALTER.,"To chase the flying Sun, whose flight has left"
1694,WALTER.,Footprints of glory in the clouded west:
1695,WALTER.,"Swift is she haled by wingÃ¨d swimming steeds,"
1696,WALTER.,"Whose cloudy manes are wet with heavy dews,"
1697,WALTER.,And dews are drizzling from her chariot wheels.
1698,WALTER.,"Soft in her lap lies drowsy-lidded Sleep,"
1699,WALTER.,"Brainful of dreams, as summer hive with bees;"
1700,WALTER.,And round her in the pale and spectral light
1701,WALTER.,Flock bats and grisly owls on noiseless wings.
1702,WALTER.,"The flying sun goes down the burning west,"
1703,WALTER.,"Vast night comes noiseless up the eastern slope,"
1704,WALTER.,And so the eternal chase goes round the world.
1705,WALTER.,
1706,WALTER.,Unrest! unrest! The passion-panting sea
1707,WALTER.,Watches the unveiled beauty of the stars
1708,WALTER.,Like a great hungry soul. The unquiet clouds
1709,WALTER.,"Break and dissolve, then gather in a mass,"
1710,WALTER.,And float like mighty icebergs through the blue.
1711,WALTER.,"Summers, like blushes, sweep the face of earth;"
1712,WALTER.,Heaven yearns in stars. Down comes the frantic rain;
1713,WALTER.,We hear the wail of the remorseful winds
1714,WALTER.,In their strange penance. And this wretched orb
1715,WALTER.,"Knows not the taste of rest; a maniac world,"
1716,WALTER.,Homeless and sobbing through the deep she goes.

1722,WALTER.,'Tis ages since he made his younger star.
1723,WALTER.,"His hand was on thee as 'twere yesterday,"
1724,WALTER.,"Thou later Revelation! Silver Stream,"
1725,WALTER.,Breaking with laughter from the lake divine
1726,WALTER.,Whence all things flow! O bright and singing babe!
1727,WALTER.,What wilt thou be hereafter?--Why should man
1728,WALTER.,Perpetuate this round of misery
1729,WALTER.,When he has in his hand the power to close it?
1730,WALTER.,"Let there be no warm hearts, no love on earth."
1731,WALTER.,No Love! No Love! Love bringeth wretchedness.
1732,WALTER.,No holy marriage. No sweet infant smiles.
1733,WALTER.,No mother's bending o'er the innocent sleep
1734,WALTER.,With unvoiced prayers and with happy tears.
1735,WALTER.,"Let the whole race die out, and with a stroke,"

1778,WALTER.,"Thou canst not draw down fame upon thy head,"
1779,WALTER.,And yet would cling to life! I'll not believe it;
1780,WALTER.,"The faces of all things belie their hearts,"
1781,WALTER.,Each man's as weary of his life as I.
1782,WALTER.,This anguish'd earth shines on the moon--a moon.
1783,WALTER.,The moon hides with a cloak of tender light
1784,WALTER.,A scarr'd heart fed upon by hungry fires.
1785,WALTER.,"Black is this world, but blacker is the next;"
1786,WALTER.,There is no rest for any living soul:
1787,WALTER.,We are immortals--and must bear with us
1788,WALTER.,Through all eternity this hateful being;
1789,WALTER.,"Restlessly flitting from pure star to star,"
1790,WALTER.,"The memory of our sins, deceits, and crimes,"
1791,WALTER.,Eating into us like a poisoned robe.

1935,SCENE VI.,Gazing in utter misery
1936,SCENE VI.,"Upon that sad and silent place,"

1942,SCENE VI.,I turned and asked her of the child.
1943,SCENE VI.,"""She is gone hence,"" quoth she,"
1944,SCENE VI.,"""To be with Christ in Paradise."
1945,SCENE VI.,"Oh, sir! I stilled her infant cries,"

1947,SCENE VI.,"Though we were ever at her side,"
1948,SCENE VI.,"And saw life fading in her cheek,"

1950,SCENE VI.,Till just before she died;
1951,SCENE VI.,"In the wild heart of that eclipse,"

1953,SCENE VI.,
1954,SCENE VI.,"'The callow young were huddling in the nests,"

1961,SCENE VI.,
1962,SCENE VI.,"I gave Him all my being, like a flower"

2110,WALTER.,"Its hope, its yearning, told to earth and heaven,"
2111,WALTER.,"Our troubled age shall pass, as doth a day"
2112,WALTER.,That leaves the west all crimson with the promise
2113,WALTER.,"Of the diviner morrow, which even then"
2114,WALTER.,Is hurrying up the world's great side with light.
2115,WALTER.,"Father! if I should live to see that morn,"
2116,WALTER.,"Let me go upward, like a lark, to sing"
2117,WALTER.,One song in the dawning!
2118,WALTER.,
2119,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2120,EDWARD.,
2121,EDWARD.,"Ah, my ardent friend!"
2122,EDWARD.,"You need not tinker at this leaking world,"
2123,EDWARD.,'Tis ruined past all cure.
2124,EDWARD.,
2125,WALTER.,WALTER.
2126,WALTER.,
2127,WALTER.,"Edward, for shame!"
2128,WALTER.,Not on a path of reprobation runs
2129,WALTER.,The trembling earth. God's eye doth follow her
2130,WALTER.,"With far more love than doth her maid, the moon."
2131,WALTER.,"Speak no harsh words of Earth, she is our mother,"
2132,WALTER.,"And few of us, her sons, who have not added"
2133,WALTER.,"A wrinkle to her brow. She gave us birth,"
2134,WALTER.,"We drew our nurture from her ample breast,"
2135,WALTER.,"And there is coming, for us both, an hour"
2136,WALTER.,When we shall pray that she will ope her arms
2137,WALTER.,"And take us back again. Oh, I would pledge"
2138,WALTER.,"My heart, my blood, my brain, to ease the earth"
2139,WALTER.,Of but one single pang!
2140,WALTER.,
2141,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2142,EDWARD.,
2143,EDWARD.,So would not I.
2144,EDWARD.,Because the pangs of earth shall ne'er be eased.
2145,EDWARD.,"We sleep on velvets now, instead of leaves;"
2146,EDWARD.,"The land is covered with a net of iron,"
2147,EDWARD.,"Upon whose spider-like, far-stretching lines,"
2148,EDWARD.,"The trains are rushing, and the peevish sea"
2149,EDWARD.,"Frets 'gainst the bulging bosoms of the ships,"
2150,EDWARD.,Whose keels have waked it from its hour's repose.
2151,EDWARD.,Walter! this height of civilisation's tide
2152,EDWARD.,Measures our wrong. We've made the immortal Soul
2153,EDWARD.,Slave to the Body. 'Tis the Soul has wrought
2154,EDWARD.,"And laid the iron roads, evoked a power"
2155,EDWARD.,"Next mightiest to God, to drive the trains"
2156,EDWARD.,That bring the country butter up to town;
2157,EDWARD.,"Has drawn the terrible lightning from its cloud,"
2158,EDWARD.,"And tamed it to an eager Mercury,"
2159,EDWARD.,Running with messages of news and gain;
2160,EDWARD.,"And still the Soul is tasked to harder work,"
2161,EDWARD.,"For Paradise, according to the world,"
2162,EDWARD.,Is scarce a league a-head.
2163,EDWARD.,
2164,WALTER.,WALTER.
2165,WALTER.,
2166,WALTER.,The man I loved
2167,WALTER.,"Wrought this complaint of thine into a song,"
2168,WALTER.,Which I sung long ago.
2169,WALTER.,
2170,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2171,EDWARD.,
2172,EDWARD.,We must reverse
2173,EDWARD.,"The plans of ages. Let the Body sweat,"
2174,EDWARD.,"So that the soul be calm, why should _it_ work?"
2175,EDWARD.,"Say, had I spent the pith of half my life,"
2176,EDWARD.,"And made me master of our English law,"
2177,EDWARD.,"What gain had I on resurrection morn,"
2178,EDWARD.,"But such as hath the body of a clown,"
2179,EDWARD.,That it could turn a summerset on earth?
2180,EDWARD.,"A single soul is richer than all worlds,"
2181,EDWARD.,"Its acts are only shadows of itself,"
2182,EDWARD.,And oft its wondrous wealth is all unknown;
2183,EDWARD.,"'Tis like a mountain-range, whose rugged sides"
2184,EDWARD.,"Feed starveling flocks of sheep; pierce the bare sides,"
2185,EDWARD.,And they ooze plenteous gold. We must go down
2186,EDWARD.,"And work our souls like mines, make books our lamps,"
2187,EDWARD.,"Not shrines to worship at, nor heed the world--"
2188,EDWARD.,Let it go roaring past. You sigh for Fame;
2189,EDWARD.,"Would serve as long as Jacob for his love,"
2190,EDWARD.,So you might win her. Spirits calm and still
2191,EDWARD.,"Are high above your order, as the stars"
2192,EDWARD.,Sit large and tranquil o'er the restless clouds
2193,EDWARD.,"That weep and lighten, pelt the earth with hail,"
2194,EDWARD.,And fret themselves away. The truly great
2195,EDWARD.,"Rest in the knowledge of their own deserts,"
2196,EDWARD.,Nor seek the confirmation of the world.
2197,EDWARD.,Wouldst thou be calm and still?
2198,EDWARD.,
2199,WALTER.,WALTER.
2200,WALTER.,
2201,WALTER.,I'd be as lieve
2202,WALTER.,"A minnow to leviathan, that draws"
2203,WALTER.,A furrow like a ship. Away! away!
2204,WALTER.,You'd make the world a very oyster-bed.
2205,WALTER.,"I'd rather be the glad, bright-leaping foam,"
2206,WALTER.,Than the smooth sluggish sea. O let me live
2207,WALTER.,To love and flush and thrill--or let me die!
2208,WALTER.,
2209,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2210,EDWARD.,
2211,EDWARD.,"And yet, what weariness was on your tongue"
2212,EDWARD.,An hour ago!--you shall be wearier yet.

2220,WALTER.,
2221,WALTER.,"The lark is singing in the blinding sky,"
2222,WALTER.,Hedges are white with May. The bridegroom sea
2223,WALTER.,"Is toying with the shore, his wedded bride,"
2224,WALTER.,"And, in the fulness of his marriage joy,"
2225,WALTER.,"He decorates her tawny brow with shells,"
2226,WALTER.,"Retires a space, to see how fair she looks,"
2227,WALTER.,"Then proud, runs up to kiss her. All is fair--"
2228,WALTER.,"All glad, from grass to sun! Yet more I love"
2229,WALTER.,"Than this, the shrinking day, that sometimes comes"
2230,WALTER.,"In Winter's front, so fair 'mong its dark peers,"
2231,WALTER.,"It seems a straggler from the files of June,"
2232,WALTER.,"Which in its wanderings had lost its wits,"
2233,WALTER.,"And half its beauty; and, when it returned,"
2234,WALTER.,"Finding its old companions gone away,"
2235,WALTER.,"It joined November's troop, then marching past;"
2236,WALTER.,"And so the frail thing comes, and greets the world"
2237,WALTER.,"With a thin crazy smile, then bursts in tears,"
2238,WALTER.,And all the while it holds within its hand
2239,WALTER.,A few half-withered flowers. I love and pity it!
2240,WALTER.,
2241,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2242,EDWARD.,
2243,EDWARD.,Air is like Happiness or Poetry.
2244,EDWARD.,"We see it in the glorious roof of day,"
2245,EDWARD.,"We feel it lift the down upon the cheek,"
2246,EDWARD.,"We hear it when it sways the heavy woods,"
2247,EDWARD.,We close our hand on 't--and we have it not.
2248,EDWARD.,
2249,WALTER.,WALTER.
2250,WALTER.,
2251,WALTER.,I'd be above all things the summer wind
2252,WALTER.,"Blowing across a kingdom, rich with alms"
2253,WALTER.,"From ev'ry flower and forest, ruffling oft"
2254,WALTER.,"The sea to transient wrinkles in the sun,"
2255,WALTER.,Where ev'ry wrinkle is a flash of light.
2256,WALTER.,
2257,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2258,EDWARD.,
2259,EDWARD.,"Like God, I would pervade Humanity,"
2260,EDWARD.,"From bridegroom dreaming on his marriage morn,"
2261,EDWARD.,To a wild wretch tied on the farthest bough
2262,EDWARD.,"Of oak that roars on edge of an abyss,"
2263,EDWARD.,The while the desperate wind with all its strength
2264,EDWARD.,"Strains the whole night to drive it down the gulf,"
2265,EDWARD.,Which like a beast gapes wide for man and tree.
2266,EDWARD.,I'd creep into the lost and ruined hearts
2267,EDWARD.,"Of sinful women dying in the streets,--"
2268,EDWARD.,"Of pinioned men, their necks upon the block,"
2269,EDWARD.,Axe gleaming in the air.
2270,EDWARD.,
2271,WALTER.,WALTER.
2272,WALTER.,
2273,WALTER.,"Away, away!"
2274,WALTER.,"Break not, my Edward, this consummate hour;"
2275,WALTER.,For very oft within the year that's past
2276,WALTER.,I've fought against thy drifts of wintry thought
2277,WALTER.,"Till they put out my fires, and I have lain,"
2278,WALTER.,A volcano choked with snow. Now let me rest!
2279,WALTER.,"If I should wear a rose but once in life,"
2280,WALTER.,"You surely would not tear it leaf from leaf,"
2281,WALTER.,And trample all its sweetness in the dust!
2282,WALTER.,Thy dreary thoughts will make my festal heart
2283,WALTER.,As empty and as desolate's a church
2284,WALTER.,When worshippers are gone and night comes down.
2285,WALTER.,"Spare me this happy hour, and let me rest!"
2286,WALTER.,
2287,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2288,EDWARD.,
2289,EDWARD.,The banquet you do set before your joys
2290,EDWARD.,"Is surely but indifferently served,"
2291,EDWARD.,When they so readily vacate their seats.
2292,EDWARD.,
2293,EDWARD.,WALTER (_abstractedly_).
2294,EDWARD.,
2295,EDWARD.,Would I could raise the dead!
2296,EDWARD.,I am as happy as the singing heavens--
2297,EDWARD.,"There was one very dear to me that died,"
2298,EDWARD.,With heart as vacant as a last-year's nest.
2299,EDWARD.,"Oh, could I bring her back, I'd empty mine,"
2300,EDWARD.,And brim hers with my joy!--enough for both.
2301,EDWARD.,
2302,EDWARD.,EDWARD (_after a pause_).
2303,EDWARD.,
2304,EDWARD.,"The garrulous sea is talking to the shore,"
2305,EDWARD.,Let us go down and hear the greybeard's speech.
2306,EDWARD.,[_They walk along the sands._
2307,EDWARD.,I shall go down to Bedfordshire to-morrow.
2308,EDWARD.,Will you go with me?
2309,EDWARD.,
2310,WALTER.,WALTER.
2311,WALTER.,
2312,WALTER.,Whom shall we see there?
2313,WALTER.,
2314,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2315,EDWARD.,
2316,EDWARD.,"Why, various specimens of that biped, Man."
2317,EDWARD.,I'll show you one who might have been an abbot
2318,EDWARD.,"In the old time; a large and portly man,"
2319,EDWARD.,"With merry eyes, and crown that shines like glass."
2320,EDWARD.,"No thin-smiled April he, bedript with tears,"
2321,EDWARD.,"But appled-Autumn, golden-cheeked and tan;"
2322,EDWARD.,A jest in his mouth feels sweet as crusted wine.
2323,EDWARD.,"As if all eager for a merry thought,"
2324,EDWARD.,The pits of laughter dimple in his cheeks.
2325,EDWARD.,"His speech is flavorous, evermore he talks"
2326,EDWARD.,"In a warm, brown, autumnal sort of style."
2327,EDWARD.,"A worthy man, Sir! who shall stand at compt"
2328,EDWARD.,"With conscience white, save some few stains of wine."
2329,EDWARD.,
2330,WALTER.,WALTER.
2331,WALTER.,
2332,WALTER.,Commend me to him! He is half right. The Past
2333,WALTER.,"Is but an emptied flask, and the rich Future"
2334,WALTER.,A bottle yet uncorked. Who is the next?
2335,WALTER.,
2336,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2337,EDWARD.,
2338,EDWARD.,"Old Mr. Wilmott; nothing in himself,"
2339,EDWARD.,But rich as ocean. He has in his hand
2340,EDWARD.,"Sea-marge and moor, and miles of stream and grove,"
2341,EDWARD.,"Dull flats, scream-startled, as the exulting train"
2342,EDWARD.,"Streams like a meteor through the frighted night,"
2343,EDWARD.,"Wind-billowed plains of wheat, and marshy fens,"
2344,EDWARD.,"Unto whose reeds on midnights blue and cold,"
2345,EDWARD.,Long strings of geese come clanging from the stars.
2346,EDWARD.,Yet wealthier in one child than in all these!
2347,EDWARD.,Oh! she is fair as Heaven! and she wears
2348,EDWARD.,The sweetest name that woman ever wore.
2349,EDWARD.,And eyes to match her name--'Tis Violet.
2350,EDWARD.,
2351,WALTER.,WALTER.
2352,WALTER.,
2353,WALTER.,"If like her name, she must be beautiful."
2354,WALTER.,
2355,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2356,EDWARD.,
2357,EDWARD.,"And so she is; she has dark violet eyes,"
2358,EDWARD.,A voice as soft as moonlight. On her cheek
2359,EDWARD.,The blushing blood miraculous doth range
2360,EDWARD.,From tender dawn to sunset. When she speaks
2361,EDWARD.,"Her soul is shining through her earnest face,"
2362,EDWARD.,As shines a moon through its up-swathing cloud--
2363,EDWARD.,"My tongue's a very beggar in her praise,"
2364,EDWARD.,It cannot gild her gold with all its words.
2365,EDWARD.,
2366,WALTER.,WALTER.
2367,WALTER.,
2368,WALTER.,Hath unbreeched Cupid struck your heart of ice?
2369,WALTER.,You speak of her as if you were her lover.
2370,WALTER.,Could _you_ not find a home within her heart?
2371,WALTER.,"No, no! you are too cold, you never loved."
2372,WALTER.,

2379,WALTER.,A desolate hearth! Did fire leap on it once?

2388,WALTER.,
2389,WALTER.,"So be it, large he sinks! Repentant Day"
2390,WALTER.,Frees with his dying hand the pallid stars
2391,WALTER.,He held imprisoned since his young hot dawn.
2392,WALTER.,Now watch with what a silent step of fear
2393,WALTER.,"They'll steal out one by one, and overspread"
2394,WALTER.,The cool delicious meadows of the night.
2395,WALTER.,
2396,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2397,EDWARD.,
2398,EDWARD.,"And lo, the first one flutters in the blue"
2399,EDWARD.,With a quick sense of liberty and joy!
2400,EDWARD.,
2401,EDWARD.,"(_Two hours afterwards_), WALTER."
2402,EDWARD.,
2403,EDWARD.,"The rosy glow has faded from the sky,"

2418,WALTER.,That shudders o'er the mournful hill of pines!
2419,WALTER.,"'Twould almost make you weep, it seems so sad."
2420,WALTER.,'Tis like an orphan trembling with the cold
2421,WALTER.,Over his mother's grave among the pines.
2422,WALTER.,Like a wild lover who has found his love
2423,WALTER.,"Worthless and foul, our friend, the sea, has left"
2424,WALTER.,"His paramour the shore; naked she lies,"
2425,WALTER.,Ugly and black and bare. Hark how he moans!
2426,WALTER.,The pain is in his heart. Inconstant fool!
2427,WALTER.,"He will be up upon her breast to-morrow,"
2428,WALTER.,As eager as to-day.

2448,WALTER.,A theatre magnificently lit
2449,WALTER.,"For sorry acting, undeserved applause?"
2450,WALTER.,Dost think there's any music in the spheres?
2451,WALTER.,"Or doth the whole creation, in thine ear,"

2472,WALTER.,Edward and I were sauntering on the shore
2473,WALTER.,Yawning with idleness; and so we came
2474,WALTER.,To kill the tedium of slow-creeping days.
2475,WALTER.,On such slight hinges an existence turns!
2476,WALTER.,How frequent in the very thick of life
2477,WALTER.,We rub clothes with a fate that hurries past!

2479,WALTER.,"We part, and turning, meet fate in the teeth."
2480,WALTER.,A moment more or less had 'voided it.

2483,WALTER.,"The sunlight falls upon a bed of flowers,"

2500,VIOLET.,"Rich with quick bouts of merry argument,"
2501,VIOLET.,"And witty sallies quenched in laughter sweet,"

2544,ARTHUR.,"Through his thin scarf of mist,"
2545,ARTHUR.,Ben-More to the sun heaves his wet shining shoulders!
2546,ARTHUR.,"I've tumbled in hay with the fresh ruddy lasses,"
2547,ARTHUR.,"I've drunk with the reapers,"

2556,ARTHUR.,"Our studious Edward from his Lincoln fens,"
2557,ARTHUR.,"And home quaint-gabled hid in rooky trees,"
2558,ARTHUR.,"Seen distant is the sun in the arch of noon,"
2559,ARTHUR.,"Seen close at hand, the same sun large and red,"
2560,ARTHUR.,"His day's work done, within the lazy west"
2561,ARTHUR.,"Sitting right portly, staring at the world"
2562,ARTHUR.,"With a round, rubicund, wine-bibbing face--"
2563,ARTHUR.,"Ha! like a dove, I see a merry song"
2564,ARTHUR.,Pluming itself for flight upon his lips.
2565,ARTHUR.,
2566,ARTHUR.,EDWARD _sings._
2567,ARTHUR.,
2568,ARTHUR.,"My heart is beating with all things that are,"
2569,ARTHUR.,My blood is wild unrest;
2570,ARTHUR.,With what a passion pants yon eager star
2571,ARTHUR.,Upon the water's breast!
2572,ARTHUR.,"Clasped in the air's soft arms the world doth sleep,"
2573,ARTHUR.,"Asleep its moving seas, its humming lands;"
2574,ARTHUR.,With what an hungry lip the ocean deep
2575,ARTHUR.,Lappeth for ever the white-breasted sands;
2576,ARTHUR.,"What love is in the moon's eternal eyes,"
2577,ARTHUR.,Leaning unto the earth from out the midnight skies!
2578,ARTHUR.,
2579,ARTHUR.,"Thy large dark eyes are wide upon my brow,"
2580,ARTHUR.,Filled with as tender light
2581,ARTHUR.,"As yon low moon doth fill the heavens now,"
2582,ARTHUR.,This mellow autumn night!
2583,ARTHUR.,"On the late flowers I linger at thy feet,"
2584,ARTHUR.,"I tremble when I touch thy garment's rim,"
2585,ARTHUR.,"I clasp thy waist, I feel thy bosom's beat--"
2586,ARTHUR.,O kiss me into faintness sweet and dim!
2587,ARTHUR.,"Thou leanest to me as a swelling peach,"
2588,ARTHUR.,"Full-juiced and mellow, leaneth to the taker's reach."
2589,ARTHUR.,
2590,ARTHUR.,"Thy hair is loosened by that kiss you gave,"
2591,ARTHUR.,It floods my shoulders o'er;
2592,ARTHUR.,"Another yet! Oh, as a weary wave"
2593,ARTHUR.,"Subsides upon the shore,"
2594,ARTHUR.,"My hungry being with its hopes, its fears,"
2595,ARTHUR.,"My heart like moon-charmed waters, all unrest,"
2596,ARTHUR.,"Yet strong as is despair, as weak as tears,"
2597,ARTHUR.,Doth faint upon thy breast!
2598,ARTHUR.,"I feel thy clasping arms, my cheek is wet"
2599,ARTHUR.,"With thy rich tears. One kiss! Sweet, sweet, another yet!"
2600,ARTHUR.,
2601,ARTHUR.,"I sang this song some twenty years ago,"
2602,ARTHUR.,"(Hot to the ear-tips, with great thumps of heart),"
2603,ARTHUR.,"On the gold lawn, while, CÃ¦sar-like, the sun"
2604,ARTHUR.,Gathered his robes around him as he fell.
2605,ARTHUR.,
2606,ARTHUR.,ARTHUR.
2607,ARTHUR.,
2608,ARTHUR.,"Struck by some country cousin, a rosy beauty"
2609,ARTHUR.,"Of the Dutch-cheese order, riched with great black eyes,"
2610,ARTHUR.,"Which, when you planned a theft upon her lips,"
2611,ARTHUR.,Looked your heart quite away!
2612,ARTHUR.,"Oh, Love! oh, Wine! thou sun and moon o' our lives,"
2613,ARTHUR.,What oysters were we without love and wine!
2614,ARTHUR.,"Our host, I doubt not, vaults a mighty tun,"
2615,ARTHUR.,"Wide-wombed and old, cobwebbed and dusted o'er."
2616,ARTHUR.,Broach! and within its gloomy sides you'll find
2617,ARTHUR.,"A beating heart of wine. The world's a tun,"
2618,ARTHUR.,"A gloomy tun, but he who taps the world"
2619,ARTHUR.,"Will find much sweetness in 't. Walter, my boy,"
2620,ARTHUR.,Against this sun of wine's most purple light
2621,ARTHUR.,Burst into song.
2622,ARTHUR.,
2623,WALTER.,WALTER.
2624,WALTER.,
2625,WALTER.,"I fear, Sir, I have none."
2626,WALTER.,
2627,ARTHUR.,ARTHUR.
2628,ARTHUR.,
2629,ARTHUR.,"Hang nuts in autumn woods? Then 't is your trade,"
2630,ARTHUR.,"Spin us a new one. Come! some youth love-mad,"
2631,ARTHUR.,"Reading the thoughts within his lady's eyes,"
2632,ARTHUR.,"Earnest as One that looks into the Book,"
2633,ARTHUR.,Seeking the road to bliss--
2634,ARTHUR.,Clothe me this bare bough with your sunny flowers.
2635,ARTHUR.,
2636,WALTER.,WALTER.
2637,WALTER.,
2638,WALTER.,The evening heaven is not always dressed
2639,WALTER.,"With frail cloud-empires of the setting sun,"
2640,WALTER.,Nor are we always in our singing-robes.
2641,WALTER.,"I have no song, nor can I make you one;"
2642,WALTER.,"But, with permission, I will tell a tale."
2643,WALTER.,
2644,ARTHUR.,ARTHUR.
2645,ARTHUR.,
2646,ARTHUR.,"If short and merry, Heaven speed your tongue;"
2647,ARTHUR.,"If long and sad, the Lord have mercy on us!"
2648,ARTHUR.,
2649,WALTER.,WALTER.
2650,WALTER.,
2651,WALTER.,"Within a city One was born to toil,"
2652,WALTER.,Whose heart could not mate with the common doom
2653,WALTER.,To fall like a spent arrow in the grave.
2654,WALTER.,"'Mid the eternal hum, the boy clomb up"
2655,WALTER.,"Into a shy and solitary youth,"
2656,WALTER.,"With strange joys and strange sorrows, oft to tears"
2657,WALTER.,"He was moved, he knew not why, when he has stood"
2658,WALTER.,"Among the lengthening shadows of the eve,"
2659,WALTER.,Such feeling overflowed him from the sky.
2660,WALTER.,"'Mong crowds he dwelt, as lonely as a star"
2661,WALTER.,"Unsphered and exiled, yet he knew no scorn."
2662,WALTER.,"Once did he say, ""For me, I'd rather live"
2663,WALTER.,"With this weak human heart and yearning blood,"
2664,WALTER.,"Lonely as God, than mate with barren souls;"
2665,WALTER.,"More brave, more beautiful, than myself must be"
2666,WALTER.,The man whom truly I can call my Friend;
2667,WALTER.,"He must be an Inspirer, who can draw"
2668,WALTER.,"To higher heights of Being, and aye stand"
2669,WALTER.,"O'er me in unreached beauty, like the moon;"
2670,WALTER.,"Soon as he fail in this, the crest and crown"
2671,WALTER.,"Of noble friendship, he is nought to me."
2672,WALTER.,What so unguessed as Death? Yet to the dead
2673,WALTER.,It lies as plain as yesterday to us.
2674,WALTER.,"Let me go forward to my grave alone,"
2675,WALTER.,"What need have I to linger by dry wells?"""
2676,WALTER.,Books were his chiefest friends. In them he read
2677,WALTER.,"Of those great spirits who went down like suns,"
2678,WALTER.,And left upon the mountain-tops of Death
2679,WALTER.,A light that made them lovely. His own heart
2680,WALTER.,Made him a Poet. Yesterday to him
2681,WALTER.,Was richer far than fifty years to come.
2682,WALTER.,Alchymist Memory turned his past to gold.
2683,WALTER.,"When morn awakes against the dark wet earth,"
2684,WALTER.,"Back to the morn she laughs with dewy sides,"
2685,WALTER.,Up goes her voice of larks! With like effect
2686,WALTER.,"Imagination opened on his life,"
2687,WALTER.,_It_ lay all lovely in that rarer light.
2688,WALTER.,
2689,WALTER.,He was with Nature on the sabbath-days;
2690,WALTER.,Far from the dressed throngs and the city bells
2691,WALTER.,"He gave his hot brows to the kissing wind,"
2692,WALTER.,While restless thoughts were stirring in his heart.
2693,WALTER.,"""These worldly men will kill me with their scorns,"
2694,WALTER.,But Nature never mocks or jeers at me;
2695,WALTER.,Her dewy soothings of the earth and air
2696,WALTER.,Do wean me from the thoughts that mad my brain.
2697,WALTER.,"Our interviews are stolen, I can look,"
2698,WALTER.,Nature! in thy serene and griefless eyes
2699,WALTER.,"But at long intervals; yet, Nature! yet,"
2700,WALTER.,Thy silence and the fairness of thy face
2701,WALTER.,Are present with me in the booming streets.
2702,WALTER.,"Yon quarry shattered by the bursting fire,"
2703,WALTER.,"And disembowelled by the biting pick,"
2704,WALTER.,Kind Nature! thou hast taken to thyself;
2705,WALTER.,"Thy weeping Aprils and soft-blowing Mays,"
2706,WALTER.,"Thy blossom-buried Junes, have smoothed its scars,"
2707,WALTER.,And hid its wounds and trenches deep in flowers.
2708,WALTER.,"So take my worn and passion-wasted heart,"
2709,WALTER.,"Maternal Nature! Take it to thyself,"
2710,WALTER.,"Efface the scars of scorn, the rents of hate,"
2711,WALTER.,"The wounds of alien eyes, visit my brain"
2712,WALTER.,"With thy deep peace, fill with thy calm my heart,"
2713,WALTER.,"And the quick courses of my human blood."""
2714,WALTER.,"Thus would he muse and wander, till the sun"
2715,WALTER.,"Reached the red west, where all the waiting clouds,"
2716,WALTER.,"Attired before in homely dun and grey,"
2717,WALTER.,Like Parasites that dress themselves in smiles
2718,WALTER.,"To feed a great man's eye, in haste put on"
2719,WALTER.,"Their purple mantles rimmed with ragged gold,"
2720,WALTER.,"And congregating in a shining crowd,"
2721,WALTER.,Flattered the sinking orb with faces bright.
2722,WALTER.,"As slow he journeyed home, the wanderer saw"
2723,WALTER.,"The labouring fires come out against the dark,"
2724,WALTER.,For with the night the country seemed on flame:
2725,WALTER.,"Innumerable furnaces and pits,"
2726,WALTER.,"And gloomy holds, in which that bright slave, Fire,"
2727,WALTER.,"Doth pant and toil all day and night for man,"
2728,WALTER.,"Threw large and angry lustres on the sky,"
2729,WALTER.,And shifting lights across the long black roads.
2730,WALTER.,
2731,WALTER.,"Dungeoned in poverty, he saw afar"
2732,WALTER.,"The shining peaks of fame that wore the sun,"
2733,WALTER.,"Most heavenly bright, they mocked him through his bars,"
2734,WALTER.,"A lost man wildered on the dreary sea,"
2735,WALTER.,"When loneliness hath somewhat touched his brain,"
2736,WALTER.,"Doth shrink and shrink beneath the watching sky,"
2737,WALTER.,Which hour by hour more plainly doth express
2738,WALTER.,"The features of a deadly enemy,"
2739,WALTER.,Drinking his woes with a most hungry eye.
2740,WALTER.,"Ev'n so, by constant staring on his ills,"
2741,WALTER.,"They grew worse-featured; till, in his great rage,"
2742,WALTER.,"His spirit, like a roused sea, white with wrath,"
2743,WALTER.,"Struck at the stars. ""Hold fast! Hold fast! my brain!"
2744,WALTER.,"Had I a curse to kill with, by yon Heaven!"
2745,WALTER.,"I'd feast the worms to-night."" Dreadfuller words,"
2746,WALTER.,"Whose very terror blanched his conscious lips,"
2747,WALTER.,He uttered in his hour of agony.
2748,WALTER.,"With quick and subtle poison in his veins,"
2749,WALTER.,"With madness burning in his heart and brain,"
2750,WALTER.,"With words, like lightnings, round his pallid lips,"
2751,WALTER.,He rushed to die in the very eyes of God.
2752,WALTER.,"'Twas late, for as he reached the open roads,"
2753,WALTER.,"Where night was reddened by the drudging fires,"
2754,WALTER.,The drowsy steeples tolled the hour of One.
2755,WALTER.,"The city now was left long miles behind,"
2756,WALTER.,"A large black hill was looming 'gainst the stars,"
2757,WALTER.,"He reached its summit. Far above his head,"
2758,WALTER.,"Up there upon the still and mighty night,"
2759,WALTER.,"God's name was writ in worlds. Awhile he stood,"
2760,WALTER.,"Silent and throbbing like a midnight star,"
2761,WALTER.,"He raised his hands, alas! 'twas not in prayer--"
2762,WALTER.,"He long had ceased to pray. ""Father,"" he said,"
2763,WALTER.,"""I wished to loose some music o'er Thy world,"
2764,WALTER.,"To strike from its firm seat some hoary wrong,"
2765,WALTER.,"And then to die in autumn with the flowers,"
2766,WALTER.,"And leaves, and sunshine I have loved so well."
2767,WALTER.,Thou might'st have smoothed my way to some great end--
2768,WALTER.,But wherefore speak? Thou art the mighty God.
2769,WALTER.,This gleaming wilderness of suns and worlds
2770,WALTER.,"Is an eternal and triumphant hymn,"
2771,WALTER.,Chanted by Thee unto Thine own great self!
2772,WALTER.,"Wrapt in Thy skies, what were my prayers to Thee?"
2773,WALTER.,My pangs? My tears of blood? They could not move
2774,WALTER.,Thee from the depths of Thine immortal dream.
2775,WALTER.,"Thou hast forgotten me, God! Here, therefore, here,"
2776,WALTER.,"To-night upon this bleak and cold hill-side,"
2777,WALTER.,"Like a forsaken watch-fire will I die,"
2778,WALTER.,"And as my pale corse fronts the glittering night,"
2779,WALTER.,"It shall reproach Thee before all Thy worlds."""
2780,WALTER.,His death did not disturb that ancient Night.
2781,WALTER.,Scornfullest Night! Over the dead there hung
2782,WALTER.,"Greats gulfs of silence, blue, and strewn with stars--"
2783,WALTER.,No sound--no motion--in the eternal depths.
2784,WALTER.,
2785,EDWARD.,EDWARD.
2786,EDWARD.,
2787,EDWARD.,"Now, what a sullen-blooded fool was this,"
2788,EDWARD.,At sulks with earth and Heaven! Could he not
2789,EDWARD.,"Out-weep his passion like a blustering day,"
2790,EDWARD.,"And be clear-skied thereafter? He, poor wretch,"
2791,EDWARD.,Must needs be famous! Lord! how Poets geck
2792,EDWARD.,"At Fame, their idol. Call 't a worthless thing,"
2793,EDWARD.,"Colder than lunar rainbows, changefuller"
2794,EDWARD.,"Than sleeked purples on a pigeon's neck,"
2795,EDWARD.,"More transitory than a woman's loves,"
2796,EDWARD.,The bubbles of her heart--and yet each mocker
2797,EDWARD.,Would gladly sell his soul for one sweet crumb
2798,EDWARD.,To roll beneath his tongue.
2799,EDWARD.,
2800,WALTER.,WALTER.
2801,WALTER.,
2802,WALTER.,Alas! the youth
2803,WALTER.,"Earnest as flame, could not so tame his heart"
2804,WALTER.,As to live quiet days. When the heart-sick Earth
2805,WALTER.,"Turns her broad back upon the gaudy sun,"
2806,WALTER.,"And stoops her weary forehead to the night,"
2807,WALTER.,"To struggle with her sorrow all alone,"
2808,WALTER.,"The moon, that patient sufferer, pale with pain,"
2809,WALTER.,"Presses her cold lips on her sister's brow,"
2810,WALTER.,Till she is calm. But in _his_ sorrow's night
2811,WALTER.,He found no comforter. A man can bear
2812,WALTER.,A world's contempt when he has that within
2813,WALTER.,"Which says he's worthy--when he contemns himself,"
2814,WALTER.,There burns the hell. So this wild youth was foiled
2815,WALTER.,"In a great purpose--in an agony,"
2816,WALTER.,"In which he learned to hate and scorn himself,"
2817,WALTER.,"He foamed at God, and died."

2830,VIOLET.,Dead on the hem of May.

2861,WALTER.,"And as the sunset dies along the west,"
2862,WALTER.,"Eve higher lifts her front of trembling stars,"
2863,WALTER.,"Till she is seated in the middle sky,"
2864,WALTER.,"So gradual, one passion slowly died,"
2865,WALTER.,"And from its death the other drew fresh life,"
2866,WALTER.,Until 't was seated in his soul alone--
2867,WALTER.,"The dead was Love--the living, Poetry."

2877,WALTER.,"When with his golden hand he plucked that flower,"
2878,WALTER.,"And would have smelt it, lo! it paled and shrank,"
2879,WALTER.,"And withered in his grasp. And when she died,"
2880,WALTER.,The rivers of his heart ran all to waste;
2881,WALTER.,"They found no ocean, dry sands sucked them up."
2882,WALTER.,
2883,WALTER.,Lady! he was a fool--a pitiful fool.
2884,WALTER.,"She said she loved him, would be dead in spring--"
2885,WALTER.,She asked him but to stand beside her grave--
2886,WALTER.,She said she would be daisies--and she thought
2887,WALTER.,'Twould give her joy to feel that he was near.
2888,WALTER.,"She died like music; and, would you believe 't?"
2889,WALTER.,He kept her foolish words within his heart
2890,WALTER.,As ceremonious as a chapel keeps
2891,WALTER.,A relic of a saint. And in the spring
2892,WALTER.,The doting idiot went!
2893,WALTER.,

2900,WALTER.,"Laugh till your sides ache! Oh, he went, poor fool!"

2903,WALTER.,"Amid the comfortless rain he stood and wept,"
2904,WALTER.,"Bare-headed, in the mocking, pelting rain."
2905,WALTER.,He might have known 'twas ever so on earth.

2940,WALTER.,What mean you?

2943,VIOLET.,
2944,VIOLET.,That like the moon you need not wrap yourself
2945,VIOLET.,In any cloud; you shine through each disguise;
2946,VIOLET.,You are a masker in a mask of glass.
2947,VIOLET.,"You've such transparent sides, each casual eye"

2968,VIOLET.,
2969,VIOLET.,"A new-born power,"

2972,VIOLET.,May nurture it to either.
2973,VIOLET.,
2974,WALTER.,WALTER.

2976,WALTER.,To thee I'm bare.
2977,WALTER.,"My heart lies open to you, as the earth"

2979,WALTER.,The finger of my soul doth point it out;
2980,WALTER.,I trust God's finger points it also out.
2981,WALTER.,"I must attempt it; if my sinews fail,"
2982,WALTER.,"On my unsheltered head men's scorns will fall,"
2983,WALTER.,Like a slow shower of fire. Yet if one tear

2987,VIOLET.,
2988,VIOLET.,I'll give thee tears.--
2989,VIOLET.,
2990,WALTER.,WALTER.
2991,WALTER.,
2992,WALTER.,That were as queenly Night
2993,WALTER.,"Would loosen all the jewels from her hair,"
2994,WALTER.,"And hail them on this sordid thing, the earth."
2995,WALTER.,Thy tears keep for a worthier head than mine.
2996,WALTER.,
2997,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
2998,VIOLET.,
2999,VIOLET.,I will not cope with you in compliment.
3000,VIOLET.,"I'll give you tears, and pity, and true thoughts;"

3002,VIOLET.,"I know 'tis little worth, but any hut,"
3003,VIOLET.,"However poor, unto a homeless man,"

3005,VIOLET.,But if you conquer Fame----

3007,WALTER.,WALTER.
3008,WALTER.,
3009,WALTER.,With eager hands
3010,WALTER.,"I'll bend the awful thing into a crown,"

3023,ARTHUR.,The night is out at elbows. Laughter's dead.
3024,ARTHUR.,"To the rescue, Violet! A song! a song!"
3025,ARTHUR.,
3026,ARTHUR.,VIOLET _sings._
3027,ARTHUR.,
3028,ARTHUR.,"Upon my knee a modern minstrel's tales,"
3029,ARTHUR.,"Full as a choir with music, lies unread;"
3030,ARTHUR.,My impatient shallop flaps its silken sails
3031,ARTHUR.,"To rouse me, but I cannot lift my head."
3032,ARTHUR.,"I see a wretched isle, that ghost-like stands,"
3033,ARTHUR.,Wrapt in its mist-shroud in the wint'ry main;
3034,ARTHUR.,"And now a cheerless gleam of red-ploughed lands,"
3035,ARTHUR.,O'er which a crow flies heavy in the rain.
3036,ARTHUR.,
3037,ARTHUR.,I've neither heart nor voice!
3038,ARTHUR.,[_Rises and draws the curtain._
3039,ARTHUR.,"You've sat the night out, Masters! See, the moon"

3062,VIOLET.,"You loved, then, very much, this friend of thine?"
3063,VIOLET.,
3064,WALTER.,WALTER.
3065,WALTER.,
3066,WALTER.,The sound of his voice did warm my heart like wine.
3067,WALTER.,"He's long since dead; but if there is a heaven,"
3068,WALTER.,He's in its heart of bliss.
3069,WALTER.,
3070,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3071,VIOLET.,
3072,VIOLET.,How did you live?
3073,VIOLET.,
3074,WALTER.,WALTER.
3075,WALTER.,
3076,WALTER.,"We read and wrote together, slept together;"
3077,WALTER.,"We dwelt on slopes against the morning sun,"
3078,WALTER.,"We dwelt in crowded streets, and loved to walk"
3079,WALTER.,"While Labour slept; for, in the ghastly dawn,"
3080,WALTER.,"The wildered city seemed a demon's brain,"
3081,WALTER.,The children of the night its evil thoughts.
3082,WALTER.,"Sometimes we sat whole afternoons, and watched"
3083,WALTER.,"The sunset build a city frail as dream,"
3084,WALTER.,"With bridges, streets of splendour, towers; and saw"
3085,WALTER.,"The fabrics crumble into rosy ruins,"
3086,WALTER.,And then grow grey as heath. But our chief joy
3087,WALTER.,Was to draw images from everything;
3088,WALTER.,"And images lay thick upon our talk,"
3089,WALTER.,As shells on ocean sands.
3090,WALTER.,
3091,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3092,VIOLET.,
3093,VIOLET.,From everything!
3094,VIOLET.,"Here is the sunset, yonder grows the moon,"
3095,VIOLET.,What image would you draw from these?
3096,VIOLET.,
3097,WALTER.,WALTER.
3098,WALTER.,
3099,WALTER.,"Why, this."
3100,WALTER.,The sun is dying like a cloven king
3101,WALTER.,"In his own blood; the while the distant moon,"
3102,WALTER.,"Like a pale prophetess, whom he has wronged,"
3103,WALTER.,"Leans eager forward, with most hungry eyes,"
3104,WALTER.,"Watching him bleed to death, and, as he faints,"
3105,WALTER.,"She brightens and dilates; revenge complete,"
3106,WALTER.,She walks in lonely triumph through the night.
3107,WALTER.,
3108,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3109,VIOLET.,
3110,VIOLET.,Give not such hateful passion to the orb
3111,VIOLET.,"That cools the heated lands; that ripes the fields,"
3112,VIOLET.,"While sleep the husbandmen, then hastes away"
3113,VIOLET.,"Ere the first step of dawn, doing all good"
3114,VIOLET.,In secret and the night. 'Tis very wrong.
3115,VIOLET.,Would I had known your friend!
3116,VIOLET.,
3117,WALTER.,WALTER.
3118,WALTER.,
3119,WALTER.,Iconoclast!
3120,WALTER.,'Tis better as it is.
3121,WALTER.,
3122,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3123,VIOLET.,
3124,VIOLET.,Why is it so?
3125,VIOLET.,
3126,WALTER.,WALTER.
3127,WALTER.,
3128,WALTER.,"Because you would have loved him, and then I"
3129,WALTER.,"Would have to wander outside of all joy,"
3130,WALTER.,Like Neptune in the cold.                [_A pause._
3131,WALTER.,
3132,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3133,VIOLET.,
3134,VIOLET.,Do you remember
3135,VIOLET.,You promised yesterday you'd paint for me
3136,VIOLET.,Three pictures from your life?
3137,VIOLET.,
3138,WALTER.,WALTER.
3139,WALTER.,
3140,WALTER.,I'll do so now.
3141,WALTER.,"On this delicious eve, with words like colours,"
3142,WALTER.,I'll limn them on the canvass of your sense.
3143,WALTER.,
3144,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3145,VIOLET.,
3146,VIOLET.,"Be quick! be quick! for see, the parting sun"
3147,VIOLET.,"But peers above yon range of crimson hills,"
3148,VIOLET.,Taking his last look of this lovely scene.
3149,VIOLET.,Dusk will be here anon.
3150,VIOLET.,
3151,WALTER.,WALTER.
3152,WALTER.,
3153,WALTER.,And all the stars!
3154,WALTER.,
3155,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3156,VIOLET.,
3157,VIOLET.,Great friends of yours; you love them overmuch.
3158,VIOLET.,
3159,WALTER.,WALTER.
3160,WALTER.,
3161,WALTER.,I love the stars too much! The tameless sea
3162,WALTER.,"Spreads itself out beneath them, smooth as glass."
3163,WALTER.,"You cannot love them, lady, till you dwell"
3164,WALTER.,"In mighty towns; immured in their black hearts,"
3165,WALTER.,The stars are nearer to you than the fields.
3166,WALTER.,"I'd grow an Atheist in these towns of trade,"
3167,WALTER.,Were 't not for stars. The smoke puts heaven out;
3168,WALTER.,"I meet sin-bloated faces in the streets,"
3169,WALTER.,"And shrink as from a blow. I hear wild oaths,"
3170,WALTER.,"And curses spilt from lips that once were sweet,"
3171,WALTER.,And sealed for Heaven by a mother's kiss.
3172,WALTER.,"I mix with men whose hearts of human flesh,"
3173,WALTER.,"Beneath the petrifying touch of gold,"
3174,WALTER.,Have grown as stony as the trodden ways.
3175,WALTER.,"I see no trace of God, till in the night,"
3176,WALTER.,"While the vast city lies in dreams of gain,"
3177,WALTER.,He doth reveal himself to me in heaven.
3178,WALTER.,My heart swells to Him as the sea to the moon;
3179,WALTER.,Therefore it is I love the midnight stars.
3180,WALTER.,
3181,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3182,VIOLET.,
3183,VIOLET.,I would I had a lover who could give
3184,VIOLET.,"Such ample reasons for his loving me,"
3185,VIOLET.,As you for loving stars! But to your task.
3186,VIOLET.,
3187,WALTER.,WALTER.
3188,WALTER.,
3189,WALTER.,Wilt listen to the pictures of my life?
3190,WALTER.,
3191,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3192,VIOLET.,
3193,VIOLET.,Patient as evening to the nightingale!
3194,VIOLET.,
3195,WALTER.,WALTER.
3196,WALTER.,
3197,WALTER.,'Mong the green lanes of Kent--green sunny lanes--
3198,WALTER.,"Where troops of children shout, and laugh, and play,"
3199,WALTER.,"And gather daisies, stood an antique home,"
3200,WALTER.,"Within its orchard, rich with ruddy fruits,"
3201,WALTER.,For the full year was laughing in his prime.
3202,WALTER.,"Wealth of all flowers grew in that garden green,"
3203,WALTER.,And the old porch with its great oaken door
3204,WALTER.,"Was smothered in rose-blooms, while o'er the walls"
3205,WALTER.,The honeysuckle clung deliriously.
3206,WALTER.,"Before the door there lay a plot of grass,"
3207,WALTER.,"Snowed o'er with daisies,--flower by all beloved,"
3208,WALTER.,"And famousest in song--and in the midst,"
3209,WALTER.,"A carvÃ¨d fountain stood, dried up and broken,"
3210,WALTER.,On which a peacock perched and sunned itself;
3211,WALTER.,"Beneath, two petted rabbits, snowy white,"
3212,WALTER.,Squatted upon the sward.
3213,WALTER.,"A row of poplars darkly rose behind,"
3214,WALTER.,"Around whose tops, and the old-fashioned vanes,"
3215,WALTER.,"White pigeons fluttered, and o'er all was bent"
3216,WALTER.,"The mighty sky, with sailing sunny clouds."
3217,WALTER.,"One casement was thrown open, and within,"
3218,WALTER.,"A boy hung o'er a book of poesy,"
3219,WALTER.,Silent as planet hanging o'er the sea.
3220,WALTER.,In at the casement open to the noon
3221,WALTER.,"Came sweetest garden-odours, and the hum--"
3222,WALTER.,"The drowsy hum--of the rejoicing bees,"
3223,WALTER.,Heavened in blooms that overclad the walls;
3224,WALTER.,"And the cool wind waved in upon his brow,"
3225,WALTER.,And stirred his curls. Soft fell the summer night.
3226,WALTER.,"Then he arose, and with inspired lips said,--"
3227,WALTER.,"""Stars! ye are golden-voicÃ¨d clarions"
3228,WALTER.,To high-aspiring and heroic dooms.
3229,WALTER.,"To-night, as I look up unto ye, Stars!"
3230,WALTER.,"I feel my soul rise to its destiny,"
3231,WALTER.,Like a strong eagle to its eyrie soaring.
3232,WALTER.,"Who thinks of weakness underneath ye, Stars?"
3233,WALTER.,"A hum shall be on earth, a name be heard,"
3234,WALTER.,An epitaph shall look up proud to God.
3235,WALTER.,"Stars! read and listen, it may not be long."""

3237,WALTER.,VIOLET (_leaning over him_).
3238,WALTER.,
3239,WALTER.,I'll see that grand desire within your eyes--
3240,WALTER.,"Oh, I only see myself!"
3241,WALTER.,
3242,WALTER.,WALTER.
3243,WALTER.,
3244,WALTER.,Violet!
3245,WALTER.,"Could you look through my heart as through mine eyes,"
3246,WALTER.,"You'd find yourself there, too."
3247,WALTER.,
3248,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3249,VIOLET.,
3250,VIOLET.,"Hush, flatterer!"

3254,WALTER.,
3255,WALTER.,"Three blue days passed,"
3256,WALTER.,"Full of the sun, loud with a thousand larks;"
3257,WALTER.,An evening like a grey child walked 'tween each.
3258,WALTER.,"'Twas in the quiet of the fourth day's noon,"
3259,WALTER.,The boy I speak of slumbered in the wood.
3260,WALTER.,"Like a dropt rose at an oak-root he lay,"
3261,WALTER.,A lady bent above him. He awoke;
3262,WALTER.,"She blushed like sunset, 'mid embarrassed speech;"
3263,WALTER.,"A shock of laughter made them friends at once,"
3264,WALTER.,"And laughter fluttered through their after-talk,"
3265,WALTER.,As darts a bright bird in and out the leaves.
3266,WALTER.,All day he drank her splendid light of eyes;
3267,WALTER.,Nor did they part until the deepening east
3268,WALTER.,Gan to be sprinkled with the lights of eve.
3269,WALTER.,
3270,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3271,VIOLET.,
3272,VIOLET.,Go on! go on!

3275,WALTER.,
3276,WALTER.,June sang herself to death.
3277,WALTER.,"They parted in the wood, she very pale,"
3278,WALTER.,And he walked home the weariest thing on earth.
3279,WALTER.,"That night he sat in his unlighted room,"
3280,WALTER.,"Pale, sad, and solitary, sick at heart,"
3281,WALTER.,"For he had parted with his dearest friends,"
3282,WALTER.,"High aspirations, bright dreams golden-winged,"
3283,WALTER.,Troops of fine fancies that like lambs did play
3284,WALTER.,"Amid the sunshine and the virgin dews,"
3285,WALTER.,Thick-lying in the green fields of his heart.
3286,WALTER.,"Calm thoughts that dwelt like hermits in his soul,"
3287,WALTER.,"Fair shapes that slept in fancifullest bowers,"
3288,WALTER.,"Hopes and delights,--He parted with them all."
3289,WALTER.,"Linked hand in hand they went, tears in their eyes,"
3290,WALTER.,"As faint and beautiful as eyes of flowers,"
3291,WALTER.,And now he sat alone with empty soul.
3292,WALTER.,"Last night his soul was like a forest, haunted"
3293,WALTER.,"With pagan shapes; when one nymph slumbering lay,"
3294,WALTER.,"A sweet dream 'neath her eyelids, her white limbs"
3295,WALTER.,Sinking full softly in the violets dim;
3296,WALTER.,When timbrelled troops rushed past with branches green.
3297,WALTER.,"One in each fountain, riched with golden sands,"
3298,WALTER.,"With her delicious face a moment seen,"
3299,WALTER.,And limbs faint-gleaming through their watery veil.
3300,WALTER.,"To-night his soul was like that forest old,"
3301,WALTER.,"When these were reft away, and the wild wind"
3302,WALTER.,"Running like one distract 'mong their old haunts,"
3303,WALTER.,"Gold-sanded fountains, and the bladed flags."
3304,WALTER.,[_A pause._
3305,WALTER.,It is enough to shake one into tears.
3306,WALTER.,"A palace full of music was his heart,"
3307,WALTER.,An earthquake rent it open to the rain;
3308,WALTER.,The lovely music died--the bright throngs fled--
3309,WALTER.,"Despair came like a foul and grizzly beast,"
3310,WALTER.,And littered in its consecrated rooms.
3311,WALTER.,
3312,WALTER.,Nature was leaping like a Bacchanal
3313,WALTER.,"On the next morn, beneath its sky-wide sheen"
3314,WALTER.,The boy stood pallid in the rosy porch.
3315,WALTER.,"The mad larks bathing in the golden light,"
3316,WALTER.,"The flowers close-fondled by the impassioned winds,"
3317,WALTER.,"The smells that came and went upon the sense,"
3318,WALTER.,"Like faint waves on a shore, he heeded not;"
3319,WALTER.,He could not look the morning in the eyes.
3320,WALTER.,That singing morn he went forth like a ship;
3321,WALTER.,"Long years have passed, and he has not returned,"
3322,WALTER.,"Beggared or laden, home."
3323,WALTER.,
3324,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3325,VIOLET.,
3326,VIOLET.,"Ah, me, 'tis sad!"
3327,VIOLET.,And sorrow's hand as well as mine has been
3328,VIOLET.,"Among these golden curls. 'Tis past, 'tis past;"
3329,VIOLET.,"It has dissolved, as did the bank of cloud"
3330,VIOLET.,That lay in the west last night.
3331,VIOLET.,
3332,WALTER.,WALTER.
3333,WALTER.,
3334,WALTER.,"I yearned for love,"

3336,WALTER.,Yearns to the heavens for rain--none ever came.
3337,WALTER.,
3338,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3339,VIOLET.,
3340,VIOLET.,"Oh, say not so! I love thee very much;"
3341,VIOLET.,Let me but grow up like a sweet-breathed flower

3345,WALTER.,WALTER.
3346,WALTER.,
3347,WALTER.,By thy tears
3348,WALTER.,I love thee as my own immortal soul.
3349,WALTER.,"Weep, weep, my Beautiful! Upon thy face"
3350,WALTER.,There is no cloud of sorrow or distress.
3351,WALTER.,"It is as moonlight, pale, serene, and clear."
3352,WALTER.,"Thy tears are spilt of joy, they fall like rain"
3353,WALTER.,From heaven's stainless blue.
3354,WALTER.,"Bend over me, my Beautiful, my Own."
3355,WALTER.,"Oh, I could lie with face upturned for ever,"
3356,WALTER.,And on thy beauty feed as on a star!
3357,WALTER.,[_Another pause._
3358,WALTER.,Thy face doth come between me and the heaven--
3359,WALTER.,"Start not, my dearest! for I would not give"
3360,WALTER.,Thee in thy tears for all yon sky lit up
3361,WALTER.,For a god's feast to-night. And I am loved!
3362,WALTER.,"Why did you love me, Violet?"
3363,WALTER.,
3364,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3365,VIOLET.,
3366,VIOLET.,The sun
3367,VIOLET.,"Smiles on the earth, and the exuberant earth"
3368,VIOLET.,Returns the smile in flowers--'twas so with me.
3369,VIOLET.,I love thee as a fountain leaps to light--
3370,VIOLET.,I can do nothing else.
3371,VIOLET.,
3372,WALTER.,WALTER.
3373,WALTER.,
3374,WALTER.,"Say these words again,"
3375,WALTER.,And yet again; never fell on my ear
3376,WALTER.,Such drops of music.
3377,WALTER.,
3378,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3379,VIOLET.,
3380,VIOLET.,"Alas! poor words are weak,"
3381,VIOLET.,"So are the daily ills of common life,"
3382,VIOLET.,To draw the ingots and the hoarded pearls
3383,VIOLET.,From out the treasure-caverns of my heart.
3384,VIOLET.,"Suffering, despair, and death alone can do it:"
3385,VIOLET.,Poor Walter!                             [_Kisses him._

3389,WALTER.,Gods! I could out-Anthony

3391,WALTER.,Kingdoms life halfpence. I am drunk with joy.
3392,WALTER.,This is a royal hour--the top of life.
3393,WALTER.,Henceforth my path slopes downward to the grave--
3394,WALTER.,"All's dross but love. That largest Son of Time,"
3395,WALTER.,"Who wandered singing through the listening world,"
3396,WALTER.,Will be as much forgot as the canoe
3397,WALTER.,That crossed the bosom of a lonely lake
3398,WALTER.,A thousand years ago. My Beautiful!
3399,WALTER.,I would not give thy cheek for all his songs--
3400,WALTER.,Thy kiss for all his fame. Why do you weep?
3401,WALTER.,
3402,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3403,VIOLET.,
3404,VIOLET.,"To think that we, so happy now, must die."
3405,VIOLET.,
3406,WALTER.,WALTER.
3407,WALTER.,
3408,WALTER.,That thought hangs like a cold and slimy snail
3409,WALTER.,On the rich rose of love--shake it away--
3410,WALTER.,"Give me another kiss, and I will take"
3411,WALTER.,"Death at a flying leap. The night is fair,"
3412,WALTER.,"But thou art fairer, Violet! Unloose"
3413,WALTER.,"The midnight of thy tresses, let them float"
3414,WALTER.,Around us both. How the freed ringlets reel
3415,WALTER.,"Down to the dewy grass! Here lean thy head,"
3416,WALTER.,Now you will feel my heart leap 'gainst thy cheek;
3417,WALTER.,Imprison me with those white arms of thine.
3418,WALTER.,"So, so. O sweet upturnÃ¨d face! (_Kisses her._) If God"
3419,WALTER.,"Told you to-night He'd grant your dearest wish,"
3420,WALTER.,What would it be?
3421,WALTER.,
3422,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3423,VIOLET.,
3424,VIOLET.,That He would let you grow

3426,VIOLET.,
3427,WALTER.,WALTER.
3428,WALTER.,
3429,WALTER.,A greater boon than Satan's forfeit throne!
3430,WALTER.,That He would keep us beautiful and young
3431,WALTER.,"For ever, as to-night. Oh, I could live"
3432,WALTER.,"Unwearied on thy beauty, till the sun"

3446,SCENE X.,
3447,WALTER.,WALTER.
3448,WALTER.,
3449,WALTER.,Adam lost Paradise--eternal tale
3450,WALTER.,Repeated in the lives of all his sons.
3451,WALTER.,"I had a shining orb of happiness,"
3452,WALTER.,God gave it me; but sin passed over it
3453,WALTER.,"As small-pox passes o'er a lovely face,"
3454,WALTER.,Leaving it hideous. I have lost for ever
3455,WALTER.,"The Paradise of young and happy thoughts,"
3456,WALTER.,And now stand in the middle of my life
3457,WALTER.,Looking back through my tears--ne'er to return.
3458,WALTER.,"I've a stern tryst with Death, and must go on,"
3459,WALTER.,Though with slow steps and oft-reverted eyes.
3460,WALTER.,
3461,WALTER.,"'Tis a thick, rich-hazed, sumptuous autumn night;"
3462,WALTER.,The moon grows like a white flower in the sky;
3463,WALTER.,The stars are dim. The tired year rests content
3464,WALTER.,"Among her sheaves, as a fond mother rests"
3465,WALTER.,Among her children; all her work is done.
3466,WALTER.,There is a weight of peace upon the world;
3467,WALTER.,It sleeps: God's blessing on it. Not on _me_!
3468,WALTER.,"Oh, as a lewd dream stains the holy sleep,"
3469,WALTER.,"I stain the holy night, yet dare not die!"
3470,WALTER.,"I knew this river's childhood, from the lake"
3471,WALTER.,"That gave it birth, till, as if spilt from heaven,"
3472,WALTER.,"It floated o'er the face of jet-black rocks,"
3473,WALTER.,Graceful and gauzy as a snowy veil.
3474,WALTER.,"Then we were pure as the blue sky above us,"
3475,WALTER.,Now we are black alike. This stream has turned
3476,WALTER.,"The wheels of commerce, and come forth distained;"
3477,WALTER.,"And now trails slowly through a city's heart,"
3478,WALTER.,Drawing its filth as doth an evil soul
3479,WALTER.,Attract all evil things; putrid and black
3480,WALTER.,It mingles with the clear and stainless sea.
3481,WALTER.,So into pure eternity my soul
3482,WALTER.,Will disembogue itself.
3483,WALTER.,Good men have said
3484,WALTER.,"That sometimes God leaves sinners to their sin,--"
3485,WALTER.,"He has left me to mine, and I am changed;"
3486,WALTER.,"My worst part is insurgent, and my will"
3487,WALTER.,Is weak and powerless as a trembling king
3488,WALTER.,When millions rise up hungry. Woe is me!
3489,WALTER.,My soul breeds sins as a dead body worms!
3490,WALTER.,"They swarm and feed upon me. Hear me, God!"
3491,WALTER.,Sin met me and embraced me on my way;
3492,WALTER.,"Methought her cheeks were red, her lips had bloom;"
3493,WALTER.,"I kissed her bold lips, dallied with her hair:"
3494,WALTER.,She sang me into slumber. I awoke--
3495,WALTER.,"It was a putrid corse that clung to me,"
3496,WALTER.,"That _clings_ to me like memory to the damned,"
3497,WALTER.,That rots into my being. Father! God!
3498,WALTER.,"I cannot shake it off, it clings, it clings;--"
3499,WALTER.,I soon will grow as corrupt as itself.        [_A pause._
3500,WALTER.,"God sends me back my prayers, as a father"
3501,WALTER.,Returns unoped the letters of a son
3502,WALTER.,Who has dishonoured him.
3503,WALTER.,"Have mercy, Fiend!"
3504,WALTER.,"Thou Devil, thou wilt drag me down to hell."
3505,WALTER.,"Oh, if she had proclivity to sin"
3506,WALTER.,"Who did appear so beauteous and so pure,"
3507,WALTER.,Nature may leer behind a gracious mask.
3508,WALTER.,"And God himself may be----I'm giddy, blind,"
3509,WALTER.,The world reels from beneath me.
3510,WALTER.,[_Catches hold of the parapet._
3511,WALTER.,(_An outcast approaches._) Wilt pray for me?

3516,WALTER.,
3517,WALTER.,WALTER.
3518,WALTER.,
3519,WALTER.,Why is it so?

3521,WALTER.,That neither tears can cleanse nor fires eterne?
3522,WALTER.,
3523,GIRL.,GIRL.
3524,GIRL.,
3525,GIRL.,But few request _my_ prayers.
3526,GIRL.,
3527,WALTER.,WALTER.
3528,WALTER.,
3529,WALTER.,I request them.
3530,WALTER.,For ne'er did a dishevelled woman cling
3531,WALTER.,"So earnest-pale to a stern conqueror's knees,"
3532,WALTER.,"Pleading for a dear life, as did my prayer"
3533,WALTER.,"Cling to the knees of God. He shook it off,"
3534,WALTER.,And went upon His way. Wilt pray for me?
3535,WALTER.,
3536,GIRL.,GIRL.
3537,GIRL.,
3538,GIRL.,Sin crusts me o'er as limpets crust the rocks.
3539,GIRL.,I would be thrust from ev'ry human door;
3540,GIRL.,I dare not knock at heaven's.
3541,GIRL.,
3542,WALTER.,WALTER.
3543,WALTER.,
3544,WALTER.,Poor homeless one!
3545,WALTER.,There is a door stands wide for thee and me--
3546,WALTER.,The door of hell. Methinks we are well met.
3547,WALTER.,"I saw a little girl three years ago,"
3548,WALTER.,"With eyes of azure and with cheeks of red,"
3549,WALTER.,A crowd of sunbeams hanging down her face;
3550,WALTER.,Sweet laughter round her; dancing like a breeze.
3551,WALTER.,I'd rather lair me with a fiend in fire
3552,WALTER.,Than look on such a face as hers to-night.
3553,WALTER.,"But I can look on thee, and such as thee;"
3554,WALTER.,"I'll call thee ""Sister;"" do thou call me ""Brother."""
3555,WALTER.,"A thousand years hence, when we both are damned,"
3556,WALTER.,"We'll sit like ghosts upon the wailing shore,"
3557,WALTER.,And read our lives by the red light of hell.
3558,WALTER.,"Shall we not, Sister?"
3559,WALTER.,
3560,GIRL.,GIRL.
3561,GIRL.,
3562,GIRL.,"O thou strange, wild man!"
3563,GIRL.,Let me alone: what would you seek with me?
3564,GIRL.,
3565,WALTER.,WALTER.
3566,WALTER.,
3567,WALTER.,"Your ear, my Sister. I have that within"
3568,WALTER.,Which urges me to utterance. I could accost
3569,WALTER.,"A pensive angel, singing to himself"
3570,WALTER.,"Upon a hill in heaven, and leave his mind"
3571,WALTER.,"As dark and turbid as a trampled pool,"
3572,WALTER.,To purify at leisure.--I have none
3573,WALTER.,"To listen to me, save a sinful woman"
3574,WALTER.,"Upon a midnight bridge.--She was so fair,"
3575,WALTER.,God's eye could rest with pleasure on her face.
3576,WALTER.,"Oh, God, she was so happy! Her short life,"
3577,WALTER.,As full of music as the crowded June
3578,WALTER.,Of an unfallen orb. What is it now?
3579,WALTER.,"She gave me her young heart, full, full of love:"
3580,WALTER.,"My return--was to break it. Worse, far worse;"
3581,WALTER.,"I crept into the chambers of her soul,"
3582,WALTER.,"Like a foul toad, polluting as I went."
3583,WALTER.,
3584,GIRL.,GIRL.
3585,GIRL.,
3586,GIRL.,I pity her--not you. Man trusts in God;
3587,GIRL.,"He is eternal. Woman trusts in man,"

3589,GIRL.,
3590,WALTER.,WALTER.
3591,WALTER.,
3592,WALTER.,"Poor child, poor child!"
3593,WALTER.,"We sat in dreadful silence with our sin,"
3594,WALTER.,Looking each other wildly in the eyes:
3595,WALTER.,"Methought I heard the gates of heaven close,"
3596,WALTER.,"She flung herself against me, burst in tears,"
3597,WALTER.,As a wave bursts in spray. She covered me
3598,WALTER.,"With her wild sorrow, as an April cloud"
3599,WALTER.,With dim dishevelled tresses hides the hill
3600,WALTER.,On which its heart is breaking. She clung to me
3601,WALTER.,"With piteous arms, and shook me with her sobs,"
3602,WALTER.,"For she had lost her world, her heaven, her God,"
3603,WALTER.,And now had nought but me and her great wrong.
3604,WALTER.,"She did not kill me with a single word,"
3605,WALTER.,But once she lifted her tear-dabbled face--
3606,WALTER.,Had hell gaped at my feet I would have leapt
3607,WALTER.,"Into its burning throat, from that pale look."
3608,WALTER.,Still it pursues me like a haunting fiend:
3609,WALTER.,"It drives me out to the black moors at night,"
3610,WALTER.,"Where I am smitten by the hissing rain,"
3611,WALTER.,"And ruffian winds, dislodging from their troops,"
3612,WALTER.,"Hustle me shrieking, then with sudden turn"
3613,WALTER.,Go laughing to their fellows. Merciful God!
3614,WALTER.,"It comes--that face again, that white, white face,"
3615,WALTER.,"Set in a night of hair; reproachful eyes,"
3616,WALTER.,"That make me mad. Oh, save me from those eyes!"
3617,WALTER.,"They will torment me even in the grave,"
3618,WALTER.,And burn on me in Tophet.

3640,WALTER.,From shaking wind-flowers to the tarnished gold
3641,WALTER.,That rustles sere on Autumn's aged boughs.
3642,WALTER.,"I went three years ago, and now return,"
3643,WALTER.,As stag sore-hunted a long summer day
3644,WALTER.,Creeps in the eve to its deep forest-home. [_A pause._
3645,WALTER.,This is my home again! Once more I hail
3646,WALTER.,The dear old gables and the creaking vanes.
3647,WALTER.,"It stands all flecked with shadows in the moon,"
3648,WALTER.,"Patient, and white, and woeful. 'Tis so still,"
3649,WALTER.,"It seems to brood upon its youthful years,"

3652,WALTER.,"'Twas here I spent my youth, as far removed"

3654,WALTER.,As unknown isle asleep in unknown seas.
3655,WALTER.,"Gone my pure heart, and with it happy days;"
3656,WALTER.,"No manna falls around me from on high,"
3657,WALTER.,Barely from off the desert of my life
3658,WALTER.,I gather patience and severe content.
3659,WALTER.,God is a worker. He has thickly strewn
3660,WALTER.,Infinity with grandeur. God is Love;
3661,WALTER.,"He yet will wipe away Creation's tears,"

3663,WALTER.,Why work I not? The veriest mote that sports
3664,WALTER.,Its one-day life within the sunny beam
3665,WALTER.,Has its stern duties. Wherefore have I none?
3666,WALTER.,"I will throw off this dead and useless past,"
3667,WALTER.,"As a strong runner, straining for his life,"
3668,WALTER.,Unclasps a mantle to the hungry winds.
3669,WALTER.,A mighty purpose rises large and slow
3670,WALTER.,"From out the fluctuations of my soul,"
3671,WALTER.,"As, ghost-like, from the dim and tumbling sea"
3672,WALTER.,Starts the completed moon.          [_Another pause._
3673,WALTER.,"I have a heart to dare,"
3674,WALTER.,And spirit-thews to work my daring out;
3675,WALTER.,"I'll cleave the world as a swimmer cleaves the sea,"

3677,WALTER.,"With tilting full-blown chest, and scattering"

3754,CHARLES.,"And beautiful, as is the rainbowed air"
3755,CHARLES.,After May showers. Within this pleasant lair
3756,CHARLES.,He passed in writing all the winter moons;
3757,CHARLES.,"But when May came, with train of sunny noons,"
3758,CHARLES.,He chose a leafy summer-house within

3760,CHARLES.,"Oft a fine thought would flush his face divine,"

3877,SCENE XIII.,
3878,SCENE XIII.,_Afternoon._--WALTER _and_ VIOLET _entering the garden from the
3879,SCENE XIII.,house._
3880,SCENE XIII.,
3881,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3882,VIOLET.,
3883,VIOLET.,"This is the dwelling you have told me of,--"
3884,VIOLET.,"Summer again hath dressed its bloomy walls,"
3885,VIOLET.,Its fragrant front is populous with bees;
3886,VIOLET.,"This is the garden--all is very like,"
3887,VIOLET.,And yet unlike the picture in my heart;
3888,VIOLET.,I know not which is loveliest. I see
3889,VIOLET.,"Afar the wandering beauty of the stream,"
3890,VIOLET.,And nearer I can trace it as it shows
3891,VIOLET.,Its broad and gleaming back among the woods.
3892,VIOLET.,Is that the wood you slept in?
3893,VIOLET.,
3894,WALTER.,WALTER.
3895,WALTER.,
3896,WALTER.,That is it.
3897,WALTER.,"And every nook and glade and tangled dell,"
3898,WALTER.,"From its wide circle to its leafy heart,"
3899,WALTER.,Is as familiar to me as my soul.
3900,WALTER.,"Memories dwell like doves among the trees,"
3901,WALTER.,"Like nymphs in glooms, like naÃ¯ads in the wells;"
3902,WALTER.,"And some are sweet, and sadder some than death."
3903,WALTER.,[_A pause._
3904,WALTER.,"I could have sworn the world did sing in air,"
3905,WALTER.,I was so happy once. The eagle drinks
3906,WALTER.,"The keen blue morning, and the morn was mine."
3907,WALTER.,"I bathed in sunset, and to me the night"
3908,WALTER.,Was a perpetual wonder and an awe.
3909,WALTER.,"Oft, as I lay on earth and gazed at her,"
3910,WALTER.,The gliding moon with influence divine
3911,WALTER.,Would draw a most delicious tide of tears
3912,WALTER.,And spill it o'er my eyes. Sadness was joy
3913,WALTER.,Of but another sort. My happiness
3914,WALTER.,"Was flecked with vague and transitory griefs,"
3915,WALTER.,As sweetly as the shining length of June
3916,WALTER.,With evanescent eves; and through my soul
3917,WALTER.,"At intervals a regal pageant passed,"
3918,WALTER.,As through the palpitating streets the corse
3919,WALTER.,"Of a great chieftain, rolled in music rich,"
3920,WALTER.,Moves slow towards its rest. In these young days
3921,WALTER.,Existence was to me sufficient joy;
3922,WALTER.,"At once a throne and kingdom, crown and lyre."
3923,WALTER.,"Now it is but a strip of barren sand,"
3924,WALTER.,On which with earnest heart I strive to rear
3925,WALTER.,A temple to the Gods. I will not sadden you.
3926,WALTER.,[_They move on._
3927,WALTER.,This is the fountain: once it flashed and sang
3928,WALTER.,(Possessed of such exuberance of joy)
3929,WALTER.,"To golden sunrise, the blue day, and when"
3930,WALTER.,"The night grew gradual o'er it, star by star,--"
3931,WALTER.,Now it is mute as Memnon.
3932,WALTER.,
3933,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3934,VIOLET.,
3935,VIOLET.,Sad again!
3936,VIOLET.,Its brim is written over--o'er and o'er;
3937,VIOLET.,'Tis mute; but have you made its marble lips
3938,VIOLET.,As sweet as Music's?
3939,VIOLET.,
3940,WALTER.,WALTER.
3941,WALTER.,
3942,WALTER.,Miserable words!
3943,WALTER.,The offspring of some most unhappy hours.
3944,WALTER.,To me this fountain's brim is sad as though
3945,WALTER.,'Twere splashed with my own blood.
3946,WALTER.,
3947,WALTER.,
3948,WALTER.,
3949,WALTER.,VIOLET (_reads_).
3950,WALTER.,
3951,WALTER.,"""Nature cares not"
3952,WALTER.,Although her loveliness should ne'er be seen
3953,WALTER.,"By human eyes, nor praised by human tongues."
3954,WALTER.,"The cataract exults among the hills,"
3955,WALTER.,And wears its crown of rainbows all alone.
3956,WALTER.,"Libel the ocean on his tawny sands,"
3957,WALTER.,"Write verses in his praise,--the unmoved sea"
3958,WALTER.,Erases both alike. Alas for man!
3959,WALTER.,Unless his fellows can behold his deeds
3960,WALTER.,"He cares not to be great."" 'Tis very true."
3961,WALTER.,The next is written in a languid hand:
3962,WALTER.,"""Sin hath drunk up my pleasure, as eclipse"
3963,WALTER.,Drinks up the sunlight. On my spirit lies
3964,WALTER.,A malison and ban. What though the Spring
3965,WALTER.,"Makes all the hills and valleys laugh in green,--"
3966,WALTER.,"Is the sea healed, or is the plover's cry"
3967,WALTER.,Merry upon the moor? I now am kin
3968,WALTER.,"To these, and winds, and ever-suffering things."""
3969,WALTER.,"Oh, I could blot these words out with my tears!"
3970,WALTER.,
3971,WALTER.,WALTER.
3972,WALTER.,
3973,WALTER.,So could I when I wrote them.
3974,WALTER.,
3975,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
3976,VIOLET.,
3977,VIOLET.,What is next?
3978,VIOLET.,"""A sin lies dead and dreadful in my soul,"
3979,VIOLET.,Why should I gaze upon it day by day?
3980,VIOLET.,"Oh, rather, since it cannot be destroyed,"
3981,VIOLET.,Let me as reverently cover it
3982,VIOLET.,"As with a cloth we cover up the dead,"
3983,VIOLET.,"And place it in some chamber of my soul,"
3984,VIOLET.,"Where it may lie unseen as sound, yet _felt_,--"
3985,VIOLET.,"Making life hushed and awful."""
3986,VIOLET.,
3987,WALTER.,WALTER.
3988,WALTER.,
3989,WALTER.,No more. No more.
3990,WALTER.,Let God wash out this record with His rain!
3991,WALTER.,This is the summer-house.               [_They enter._
3992,WALTER.,It is as sweet
3993,WALTER.,As if enamoured Summer did adorn
3994,WALTER.,It for his Love to dwell in. I love to sit
3995,WALTER.,"And hear the pattering footsteps of the shower,"
3996,WALTER.,"As he runs over it, or watch at noon"
3997,WALTER.,The curious sunbeams peeping through the leaves.
3998,WALTER.,
3999,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
4000,VIOLET.,
4001,VIOLET.,I've always pictured you in such a place
4002,VIOLET.,"Writing your Book, and hurrying on, as if"
4003,VIOLET.,"You had a long and wondrous tale to tell,"
4004,VIOLET.,And felt Death's cold hand closing round your heart.
4005,VIOLET.,
4006,WALTER.,WALTER.
4007,WALTER.,
4008,WALTER.,Have you read my Book?
4009,WALTER.,
4010,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
4011,VIOLET.,
4012,VIOLET.,I have.
4013,VIOLET.,
4014,WALTER.,WALTER.
4015,WALTER.,
4016,WALTER.,It is enough.
4017,WALTER.,"The Book was only written for two souls,"
4018,WALTER.,And they are thine and mine.
4019,WALTER.,
4020,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
4021,VIOLET.,
4022,VIOLET.,"For many weeks,"
4023,VIOLET.,"When I was dwelling by the moaning sea,"
4024,VIOLET.,"Your name was blown to me on ev'ry wind,"
4025,VIOLET.,And I was glad; for by that sign I knew
4026,VIOLET.,"You had fulfilled your heart, and hoped you would"
4027,VIOLET.,"Put off the robes of sorrow, and put on"
4028,VIOLET.,The singing crown of Fame. One dreary morn
4029,VIOLET.,"Your Book came to me, and I fondled it,"
4030,VIOLET.,As though it were a pigeon sent from thee
4031,VIOLET.,With love beneath its wing. I read and read
4032,VIOLET.,Until the sun lifted his cloudy lids
4033,VIOLET.,"And shot wild light along the leaping deep,"
4034,VIOLET.,"Then closed his eyes in death. I shed no tear,"
4035,VIOLET.,"I laid it down in silence, and went forth"
4036,VIOLET.,Burdened with its sad thoughts: slowly I went;
4037,VIOLET.,"And, as I wandered through the deepening gloom,"
4038,VIOLET.,I saw the pale and penitential moon
4039,VIOLET.,"Rise from dark waves that plucked at her, and go"
4040,VIOLET.,Sorrowful up the sky. Then gushed my tears--
4041,VIOLET.,The tangled problem of my life was plain--
4042,VIOLET.,"I cried aloud, ""Oh, would he come to me!"
4043,VIOLET.,I know he is unhappy; that he strives
4044,VIOLET.,"As fiercely as that blind and desperate sea,"
4045,VIOLET.,"Clutching with all its waves--in vain, in vain."
4046,VIOLET.,"He never will be happy till he comes."""
4047,VIOLET.,As I went home the thought that you would come
4048,VIOLET.,"Filled my lorn heart with gladness, as the moon"
4049,VIOLET.,"Filled the great vacant night with moonlight, till"
4050,VIOLET.,Its silver bliss ran o'er--so after prayer
4051,VIOLET.,I slept in the lap of peace--next morn you came.
4052,VIOLET.,
4053,WALTER.,WALTER.
4054,WALTER.,
4055,WALTER.,And then I found you beautiful and pale--
4056,WALTER.,"Pale as that moonlight night! O Violet,"
4057,WALTER.,I have been undeceived. In my hot youth
4058,WALTER.,I kissed the painted bloom off Pleasure's lips
4059,WALTER.,"And found them pale as Pain's,--and wept aloud."
4060,WALTER.,Never henceforward can I hope to drain
4061,WALTER.,The rapture of a lifetime at a gulp.
4062,WALTER.,My happiness is not a troubled joy;
4063,WALTER.,"'Tis deep, serene as death. The sweet contents,"
4064,WALTER.,"The happy thoughts from which I've been estranged,"
4065,WALTER.,"Again come round me, as the old known peers"
4066,WALTER.,"Surround and welcome a repentant spirit,"
4067,WALTER.,Who by the steps of sorrow hath regained
4068,WALTER.,His throne and golden prime. The eve draws nigh!
4069,WALTER.,"The prosperous sun is in the west, and sees"
4070,WALTER.,"From the pale east to where he sets in bliss,"
4071,WALTER.,"His long road glorious. Wilt thou sing, my love,"
4072,WALTER.,And sadden me into a deeper joy?
4073,WALTER.,
4074,WALTER.,VIOLET _sings._
4075,WALTER.,
4076,WALTER.,"The wondrous ages pass like rushing waves,"
4077,WALTER.,"Each crowned with its own foam. Bards die, and Fame"
4078,WALTER.,Hangs like a pallid meteor o'er their graves.
4079,WALTER.,"Religions change, and come and go like flame."
4080,WALTER.,
4081,WALTER.,"Nothing remains but Love, the world's round mass"
4082,WALTER.,"It doth pervade, all forms of life it shares,"
4083,WALTER.,The institutions that like moments pass
4084,WALTER.,Are but the shapes the masking spirit wears.
4085,WALTER.,
4086,WALTER.,"Love is a sanctifier; 'tis a moon,"
4087,WALTER.,"Turning each dusk to silver. A pure light,"
4088,WALTER.,Redeemer of all errors----
4089,WALTER.,"[_Ceases, and bursts into tears._"
4090,WALTER.,
4091,WALTER.,WALTER.
4092,WALTER.,
4093,WALTER.,"What ails you, Violet?"
4094,WALTER.,Has music stung you like a very snake?
4095,WALTER.,Why do you weep?
4096,WALTER.,
4097,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
4098,VIOLET.,
4099,VIOLET.,Walter! dost thou believe
4100,VIOLET.,"Love will redeem all errors? Oh, my friend,"
4101,VIOLET.,"This gospel saves you! doubt it, you are lost."
4102,VIOLET.,"Deep in the mists of sorrow long I lay,"
4103,VIOLET.,"Hopeless and still, when suddenly _this_ truth"
4104,VIOLET.,"Like a slant sunbeam quivered through the mist,"
4105,VIOLET.,And turned it into radiance. In the light
4106,VIOLET.,"I wrote these words, while you were far away"
4107,VIOLET.,"Fighting with shadows. Oh! Walter, in one boat"
4108,VIOLET.,"We floated o'er the smooth, moon-silvered sea;"
4109,VIOLET.,The sky was smiling with its orbs of bliss;
4110,VIOLET.,"And while we lived within each other's eyes,"
4111,VIOLET.,"We struck and split, and all the world was lost"
4112,VIOLET.,In one wild whirl of horror darkening down;
4113,VIOLET.,"At last I gained a deep and silent isle,"
4114,VIOLET.,"Moaned on by a dim sea, and wandered round,"
4115,VIOLET.,"Week after week, the happy-mournful shore,"
4116,VIOLET.,Wond'ring if you had 'scaped.
4117,VIOLET.,
4118,WALTER.,WALTER.
4119,WALTER.,
4120,WALTER.,"Thou noble soul,"
4121,WALTER.,"Teach me, for thou art nearer God than I!"
4122,WALTER.,"My life was a long dream; when I awoke,"
4123,WALTER.,"Duty stood like an angel in my path,"
4124,WALTER.,"And seemed so terrible, I could have turned"
4125,WALTER.,"Into my yesterdays, and wandered back"
4126,WALTER.,"To distant childhood, and gone out to God"
4127,WALTER.,"By the gate of birth, not death. Lift, lift me up"
4128,WALTER.,"By thy sweet inspiration, as the tide"
4129,WALTER.,Lifts up a stranded boat upon the beach.
4130,WALTER.,"I will go forth 'mong men, not mailed in scorn,"
4131,WALTER.,But in the armour of a pure intent.
4132,WALTER.,"Great duties are before me and great songs,"
4133,WALTER.,"And whether crowned or crownless, when I fall"
4134,WALTER.,"It matters not, so that God's work is done."
4135,WALTER.,"I've learned to prize the quiet lightning-deed,"
4136,WALTER.,Not the applauding thunder at its heels
4137,WALTER.,Which men call Fame. Our night is past;
4138,WALTER.,"We stand in precious sunrise, and beyond"
4139,WALTER.,A long day stretches to the very end.
4140,WALTER.,"Look out, my beautiful, upon the sky!"
4141,WALTER.,"Even puts on her jewels. Look! she sets,"
4142,WALTER.,Venus upon her brow. I never gaze
4143,WALTER.,"Upon the evening but a tide of awe,"
4144,WALTER.,"And love, and wonder, from the Infinite,"
4145,WALTER.,"Swells up within me, as the running brine"
4146,WALTER.,"From the smooth-glistening, wide-heaving sea,"
4147,WALTER.,Grows in the creeks and channels of a stream
4148,WALTER.,"Until it threats its banks. It is not joy,"
4149,WALTER.,'Tis sadness more divine.
4150,WALTER.,
4151,VIOLET.,VIOLET.
4152,VIOLET.,
4153,VIOLET.,"How quick they come,--"
4154,VIOLET.,World after world! See the great moon above
4155,VIOLET.,Yon undistinguishable clump of trees
4156,VIOLET.,Is slowly from the darkness gathering light!
4157,VIOLET.,You used to love the moon!
4158,VIOLET.,
4159,WALTER.,WALTER.
4160,WALTER.,
4161,WALTER.,This mournful wind
4162,WALTER.,"Has surely been with Winter, 'tis so cold;"
4163,WALTER.,"The dews are falling, Violet! Your cloak--"
4164,WALTER.,Draw it around you. Let the still night shine!
4165,WALTER.,"A star's a cold thing to a human heart,"
4166,WALTER.,And love is better than their radiance. Come!
4167,WALTER.,Let us go in together.
4168,WALTER.,
4169,WALTER.,
4170,WALTER.,
4171,WALTER.,
4172,AN EVENING AT HOME.,AN EVENING AT HOME.
4173,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4174,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4175,AN EVENING AT HOME.,To-day a chief was buried--let him rest.
4176,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"His country's bards are up like larks, and fill"
4177,AN EVENING AT HOME.,With singing the wide heavens of his fame.
4178,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"To-night I sit within my lonely room,"
4179,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"The atmosphere is full of misty rain,"
4180,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Wretched the earth and heaven. Yesterday
4181,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"The streets and squares were choked with yellow fogs,"
4182,AN EVENING AT HOME.,To-morrow we may all be drenched in sleet!
4183,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Stretched like a homeless beggar on the ground,"
4184,AN EVENING AT HOME.,The city sleeps amid the misty rain.
4185,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Though Rain hath pitched his tent above my head,"
4186,AN EVENING AT HOME.,'Tis but a speck upon the happy world.
4187,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Since I've begun to trace these lines, Sunrise"
4188,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Has struck a land and woke its bleating hills;
4189,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Afar upon some black and silent moor
4190,AN EVENING AT HOME.,The crystal stars are shaking in the wind;
4191,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"An ocean gurgles, for the stooping moon"
4192,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Hath kissed him into peace, and now she smooths"
4193,AN EVENING AT HOME.,The well-pleased monster with her silver hand.
4194,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Come, naked, gleaming Spring! great crowds of larks"
4195,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Fluttering above thy head, thy happy ears"
4196,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Loud with their ringing songs, Bright Saviour, come!"
4197,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And kill old Winter with thy glorious look,"
4198,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And turn his corse to flowers!
4199,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4200,AN EVENING AT HOME.,I sit to-night
4201,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"As dreary as the pale, deserted East,"
4202,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"That sees the Sun, the Sun that once was hers,"
4203,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Forgetful of her, flattering his new love,"
4204,AN EVENING AT HOME.,The happy-blushing West. In these long streets
4205,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Of traffic and of noise, the human hearts"
4206,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Are hard and loveless as a wreck-strewn coast.
4207,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Eternity doth wear upon her face
4208,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"The veil of Time. They only see the veil,"
4209,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And thus they know not what they stand so near.
4210,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Oh, rich in gold! Beggars in heart and soul!"
4211,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Poor as the empty void! Why, even I,"
4212,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Sitting in this bare chamber with my thoughts,"
4213,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Am richer than ye all, despite your bales,"
4214,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Your streets of warehouses, your mighty mills,"
4215,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Each booming like a world faint heard in space:
4216,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Your ships; unwilling fires, that day and night"
4217,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Writhe in your service seven years, then die"
4218,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Without one taste of peace. Do ye believe
4219,AN EVENING AT HOME.,A simple primrose on a grassy bank
4220,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Forth-peeping to the sun, a wild bird's nest,"
4221,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"The great orb dying in a ring of clouds,"
4222,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Like hoary Jacob 'mong his waiting sons;
4223,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"The rising moon, and the young stars of God,"
4224,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Are things to love? With _these_ my soul is brimmed;
4225,AN EVENING AT HOME.,With a diviner and serener joy
4226,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Then all thy heaven of money-bags can bring
4227,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Thy dry heart, Worldling!"
4228,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4229,AN EVENING AT HOME.,The terror-stricken rain
4230,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Flings itself wildly on the window-panes,"
4231,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Imploring shelter from the chasing wind.
4232,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Alas! to-night in this wide waste of streets
4233,AN EVENING AT HOME.,It beats on human limbs as well as walls!
4234,AN EVENING AT HOME.,God led Eve forth into the empty world
4235,AN EVENING AT HOME.,From Paradise. Could our great Mother come
4236,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And see her children now, what sight were worst;"
4237,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"A worker woke by cruel Day, the while"
4238,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"A kind dream feeds with sweetest phantom-bread,"
4239,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Him, and his famished ones; or when the Wind,"
4240,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"With shuddering fingers, draws the veil of smoke,"
4241,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And scares her with a battle's bleeding face?
4242,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4243,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Most brilliant star upon the crest of Time
4244,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Is England. England! Oh, I know a tale"
4245,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Of those far summers when she lay in the sun,"
4246,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Listening to her own larks, with growing limbs,"
4247,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And mighty hands, which since have tamed the world,"
4248,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Dreaming about their tasks. This dreary night
4249,AN EVENING AT HOME.,I'll tell the story to my listening heart.
4250,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"I sang 't to thee, O unforgotten Friend!"
4251,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"(Who dwellest now on breezy English downs,"
4252,AN EVENING AT HOME.,While I am drowning in the hateful smoke)
4253,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Beside the river which I long have loved.
4254,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"O happy Days! O happy, happy Past!"
4255,AN EVENING AT HOME.,O Friend! I am a lone benighted ship;
4256,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Before me hangs the vast untravelled gloom,"
4257,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Behind, a wake of splendour, fading fast"
4258,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Into the hungry gloom from whence it came.
4259,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4260,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Two days the Lady gazed toward the west,"
4261,AN EVENING AT HOME.,The way that he had gone; and when the third
4262,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"From its high noon sloped to a rosy close,"
4263,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Upon the western margin of the isle,"
4264,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Feeding her petted swans by tossing bread
4265,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Among the clumps of water-lilies white,"
4266,AN EVENING AT HOME.,She stood. The fond Day pressed against her face;
4267,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"His am'rous, airy fingers, with her robe"
4268,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Fluttered and played, and trembling, touched her throat,"
4269,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And toying with her ringlets, could have died"
4270,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Upon her sweet lips and her happy cheeks!
4271,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"With a long rippling sigh she turned away,"
4272,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And wished the sun was underneath the hills.
4273,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Anon she sang; and ignorant Solitude,"
4274,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Astonished at the marvel of her voice,"
4275,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Stood tranced and mute as savage at the door
4276,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Of rich cathedral when the organ rolls,"
4277,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And all the answering choirs awake at once.
4278,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Then she sat down and thought upon her love;
4279,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Fed on the various wonders of his face
4280,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"To make his absence rich. ""'Tis but three days"
4281,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Since he went from me in his light canoe,"
4282,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And all the world went with him, and to-night"
4283,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"He will be back again. Oh, when he comes,"
4284,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And when my head is laid upon his breast,"
4285,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And in the pauses of the sweetest storm
4286,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Of kisses that e'er beat upon a face,"
4287,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"I'll tell him how I've pined, and sighed, and wept,"
4288,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And thought of those sweet days and nights that flew
4289,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"O'er us unheeded as a string of swans,"
4290,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"That wavers down the sky toward the sea,--"
4291,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And he will chide me into blissful tears,"
4292,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Then kiss the tears away."" Quick leapt she up,"
4293,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"""He comes! he comes!"" She laughed, and clapt her hands,"
4294,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"A light canoe came dancing o'er the lake,"
4295,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And he within it gave a cry of joy.
4296,AN EVENING AT HOME.,She sent an answer back that drew him on.
4297,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"The swans are scared,--the lilies rippled--now"
4298,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Her happy face is hidden in his breast,"
4299,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And words are lost in joy. ""My Bertha! let"
4300,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Me see myself again in those dear orbs.
4301,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Have you been lonely, love?"" She raised her head,"
4302,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"""You surely will not leave me so again!"
4303,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"I'll grow as pale 's the moon, and my praised cheeks"
4304,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Will be as wet as April's if you do."""
4305,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"As when the moon hath sleeked the blissful sea,"
4306,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"A light wind wrinkles it and passes off,"
4307,AN EVENING AT HOME.,So ran a transient trouble o'er his face.
4308,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"""My Bertha! we must leave this isle to-night."
4309,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Thy shining face is blanked! We will return
4310,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Ere thrice the day, like a great bird of light"
4311,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Flees 'cross the dark, and hides it with his wings."""
4312,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"""Ah, wherefore?"" ""Listen, I will tell you why."
4313,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4314,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"""I stood afar upon the grassy hills,"
4315,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"I saw the country with its golden slopes,"
4316,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And woods, and streams, run down to meet the sea."
4317,AN EVENING AT HOME.,I saw the basking ocean skinned with light.
4318,AN EVENING AT HOME.,I saw the surf upon the distant sands
4319,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Silent and white as snow. Above my head
4320,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"A lark was singing, 'neath a sunny cloud,"
4321,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Around the playing winds. As I went down
4322,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"There seemed a special wonder on the shore,"
4323,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Low murmuring crowds around a temple stood:
4324,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"There was a wildered music on the air,"
4325,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Which came and went, yet ever nearer grew,"
4326,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"When, lo! a train came upward from the sea"
4327,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"With snowy garments, and with reverend steps,"
4328,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Full in their front a silver cross they bore,"
4329,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And this sweet hymn they strewed along the winds.
4330,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4331,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"'Blest be this sunny morning, sweet and fair!"
4332,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Blest be the people of this pleasant land!
4333,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Ye unseen larks that sing a mile in air,"
4334,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Ye waving forests, waving green and grand,"
4335,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Ye waves, that dance upon the flashing strand,"
4336,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Ye children golden-haired! we bring, we bring"
4337,AN EVENING AT HOME.,A gospel hallowing.'
4338,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Then one stood forth and spoke against the gods;
4339,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"He called them 'cruel gods,' and then he said,"
4340,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"'We have a Father, One who dwells serene,"
4341,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"'Bove thunder and the stars, Whose eye is mild,"
4342,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And ever open as the summer sky;
4343,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Who cares for everything on earth alike,"
4344,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Who hears the plovers crying in the wind,"
4345,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"The happy linnets singing in the broom,"
4346,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Whose smile is sunshine.' When the old man ceased,"
4347,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Forth from the murmuring crowd there stepped a youth,"
4348,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"As bright-haired as a star, and cried aloud,"
4349,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"'Friends! I've grown up among the wilds, and found"
4350,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Each outward form is but a window whence
4351,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Terror or Beauty looks. Beauty I've seen
4352,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"In the sweet eyes of flowers, along the streams,"
4353,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And in the cold and crystal wells that sleep
4354,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Far in the murmur of the summer woods;
4355,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Terror in fire and thunder, in the worn"
4356,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And haggard faces of the winter clouds,"
4357,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"In shuddering winds, and oft on moonless nights"
4358,AN EVENING AT HOME.,I've heard it in the white and wailing fringe
4359,AN EVENING AT HOME.,That runs along the coast from end to end.
4360,AN EVENING AT HOME.,The mountains brooded on some wondrous thought
4361,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Which they would ne'er reveal. I seemed to stand
4362,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Outside of all things; my desire to know
4363,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Grew wild and eager as a starving wolf.
4364,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"To gain the secret of the awful world,"
4365,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"I knelt before the gods, and then held up"
4366,AN EVENING AT HOME.,My heart to them in the pure arms of prayer--
4367,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"They gave no answer, or had none to give."
4368,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Friends! I will test these sour and sullen gods:
4369,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"If they are weak, 'tis well, we then may list"
4370,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Unto the strangers; but if my affront
4371,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Draw angry fire, I shall be slain by gods,"
4372,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And Death may have no secrets. A spear! a steed!'
4373,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"A steed was brought by trembling hands, he sprang"
4374,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And dashed towards the temple with a cry.
4375,AN EVENING AT HOME.,A shudder ran through all the pallid crowds.
4376,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"I saw him enter, and my sight grew dim,"
4377,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And on a long-suspended breath I stood,"
4378,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Till one might count a hundred beats of heart:
4379,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Then he rode slowly forth, and, wondrous strange!"
4380,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Although an awful gleam lay on his face,"
4381,AN EVENING AT HOME.,His charger's limbs were drenched with terror-sweat.
4382,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Amid the anxious silence loud he cried,"
4383,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"'Gods, marvellously meek! Why, any child"
4384,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"May pluck them by the beard, spit in their face,"
4385,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Or smite them on the mouth; they can do nought,"
4386,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"But sit like poor old foolish men, and moan."
4387,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"I flung my spear.'--Here, as a singing rill"
4388,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Is in the mighty noise of ocean drowned,"
4389,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"His voice was swallowed in the shout that rose,"
4390,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And touched the heavens, ran along the hills,"
4391,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Thence came on after silence, strange and dim."
4392,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4393,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"A voice rose 'mong the strangers like a lark,"
4394,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And warbled out its joy, then died away."
4395,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And the old man that spoke before went on,"
4396,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And, oh! the gentle music of his voice"
4397,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Stirred through my heart-strings like a wind through reeds.
4398,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"He said, 'It was God's hand that shaped the world"
4399,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And laid it in the sunbeams:' and that 'God,"
4400,AN EVENING AT HOME.,With His great presence fills the universe.
4401,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"That, could we dwell like night among the stars,"
4402,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Or plunge with whales in the unsounded sea,"
4403,AN EVENING AT HOME.,He still would be around us with His care.'
4404,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And also, 'That, as flowers come back in Spring,"
4405,AN EVENING AT HOME.,We would live after Death.' I heard no more.
4406,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"I thought of thee in this delightful isle,"
4407,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Pure as a prayer, and wished that I had wings"
4408,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"To tell you swiftly, that the death we feared"
4409,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Was but a grey eve 'tween two shining days,"
4410,AN EVENING AT HOME.,That we would love for ever! Then I thought
4411,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Our home might be in that transparent star
4412,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Which we have often watched from off this verge,"
4413,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Stand in the dying sunset, large and clear--"
4414,AN EVENING AT HOME.,The humming world awoke me from my dream.
4415,AN EVENING AT HOME.,I saw the old gods tumbled on the grass
4416,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Like uncouth stones, they threw the temple wide,"
4417,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And Summer, with her bright and happy face,"
4418,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Looked in upon its gloom, and pensive grew."
4419,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"The while among the tumult of the crowds,"
4420,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Divinest hymns the white-robed strangers sang.
4421,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"I wearied for thee, Bertha! and I came."
4422,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Wilt go and hear these strangers?"" She turned on him"
4423,AN EVENING AT HOME.,A look of love--a look that richly crowned
4424,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"A moment heavenly rich, and murmured ""Yes."""
4425,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"He kissed her proudly, while a giddy tear,"
4426,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Wild with its happiness, ran down her cheek"
4427,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And perished in the dew. They took their seats,"
4428,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"And as the paddles struck, grey-pinioned Time"
4429,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Flew through the gates of sunset into Night,"
4430,AN EVENING AT HOME.,And held through stars to gain the coasts of Morn.
4431,AN EVENING AT HOME.,
4432,AN EVENING AT HOME.,'Tis done! The phantoms of my soul have fled
4433,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"Into the night, and I am left alone"
4434,AN EVENING AT HOME.,With that sweet sadness which doth ever dwell
4435,AN EVENING AT HOME.,On the brink of tears; I stare i' th' crumbling fire
4436,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Which from my brooding eye takes strangest shapes.
4437,AN EVENING AT HOME.,"The Past is with me, and I scarcely hear"
4438,AN EVENING AT HOME.,Outside the weeping of the homeless rain.

4445,LADY BARBARA.,
4446,LADY BARBARA.,"Earl Gawain wooed the Lady Barbara,--"
4447,LADY BARBARA.,"High-thoughted Barbara, so white and cold!"
4448,LADY BARBARA.,"'Mong broad-branched beeches in the summer shaw,"
4449,LADY BARBARA.,In soft green light his passion he has told.
4450,LADY BARBARA.,"When rain-beat winds did shriek across the wold,"
4451,LADY BARBARA.,The Earl to take her fair reluctant ear
4452,LADY BARBARA.,Framed passion-trembled ditties manifold;
4453,LADY BARBARA.,"Silent she sat his am'rous breath to hear,"
4454,LADY BARBARA.,"With calm and steady eyes, her heart was otherwhere."
4455,LADY BARBARA.,
4456,LADY BARBARA.,He sighed for her through all the summer weeks;
4457,LADY BARBARA.,Sitting beneath a tree whose fruitful boughs
4458,LADY BARBARA.,"Bore glorious apples with smooth-shining cheeks,"
4459,LADY BARBARA.,"Earl Gawain came and whispered, ""Lady, rouse!"
4460,LADY BARBARA.,Thou art no vestal held in holy vows;
4461,LADY BARBARA.,"Out with our falcons to the pleasant heath."""
4462,LADY BARBARA.,Her father's blood leapt up unto her brows--
4463,LADY BARBARA.,"He who, exulting on the trumpet's breath,"
4464,LADY BARBARA.,"Came charging like a star across the lists of death,"
4465,LADY BARBARA.,
4466,LADY BARBARA.,"Trembled, and passed before her high rebuke:"
4467,LADY BARBARA.,"And then she sat, her hands clasped round her knee:"
4468,LADY BARBARA.,"Like one far-thoughted was the lady's look,"
4469,LADY BARBARA.,For in a morning cold as misery
4470,LADY BARBARA.,She saw a lone ship sailing on the sea;
4471,LADY BARBARA.,"Before the north 'twas driven like a cloud,"
4472,LADY BARBARA.,High on the poop a man sat mournfully:
4473,LADY BARBARA.,The wind was whistling thorough mast and shroud.
4474,LADY BARBARA.,And to the whistling wind thus did he sing aloud:--
4475,LADY BARBARA.,
4476,LADY BARBARA.,"""Didst look last night upon my native vales,"
4477,LADY BARBARA.,Thou Sun! that from the drenching sea hast clomb?
4478,LADY BARBARA.,"Ye demon winds! that glut my gaping sails,"
4479,LADY BARBARA.,"Upon the salt sea must I ever roam,"
4480,LADY BARBARA.,Wander for ever on the barren foam?
4481,LADY BARBARA.,"O happy are ye, resting mariners."
4482,LADY BARBARA.,"O Death, that thou wouldst come and take me home!"
4483,LADY BARBARA.,"A hand unseen this vessel onward steers,"
4484,LADY BARBARA.,And onward I must float through slow moon-measured years.
4485,LADY BARBARA.,
4486,LADY BARBARA.,"""Ye winds! when like a curse ye drove us on,"
4487,LADY BARBARA.,"Frothing the waters, and along our way,"
4488,LADY BARBARA.,"Nor cape nor headland through red mornings shone,"
4489,LADY BARBARA.,"One wept aloud, one shuddered down to pray,"
4490,LADY BARBARA.,"One howled, 'Upon the Deep we are astray.'"
4491,LADY BARBARA.,On our wild hearts his words fell like a blight:
4492,LADY BARBARA.,"In one short hour my hair was stricken grey,"
4493,LADY BARBARA.,For all the crew sank ghastly in my sight
4494,LADY BARBARA.,As we went driving on through the cold starry night.
4495,LADY BARBARA.,
4496,LADY BARBARA.,"""Madness fell on me in my loneliness,"
4497,LADY BARBARA.,"The sea foamed curses, and the reeling sky"
4498,LADY BARBARA.,Became a dreadful face which did oppress
4499,LADY BARBARA.,Me with the weight of its unwinking eye.
4500,LADY BARBARA.,"It fled, when I burst forth into a cry--"
4501,LADY BARBARA.,A shoal of fiends came on me from the deep;
4502,LADY BARBARA.,"I hid, but in all corners they did pry,"
4503,LADY BARBARA.,"And dragged me forth, and round did dance and leap;"
4504,LADY BARBARA.,"They mouthed on me in dream, and tore me from sweet sleep."
4505,LADY BARBARA.,
4506,LADY BARBARA.,"""Strange constellations burned above my head,"
4507,LADY BARBARA.,"Strange birds around the vessel shrieked and flew,"
4508,LADY BARBARA.,"Strange shapes, like shadows, through the clear sea fled,"
4509,LADY BARBARA.,"As our lone ship, wide-winged, came rippling through,"
4510,LADY BARBARA.,"Angering to foam the smooth and sleeping blue."""
4511,LADY BARBARA.,"The lady sighed, ""Far, far upon the sea,"
4512,LADY BARBARA.,"My own Sir Arthur, could I die with you!"
4513,LADY BARBARA.,"The wind blows shrill between my love and me."""
4514,LADY BARBARA.,Fond heart! the space between was but the apple-tree.
4515,LADY BARBARA.,
4516,LADY BARBARA.,"There was a cry of joy, with seeking hands"
4517,LADY BARBARA.,"She fled to him, like worn bird to her nest;"
4518,LADY BARBARA.,"Like washing water on the figured sands,"
4519,LADY BARBARA.,"His being came and went in sweet unrest,"
4520,LADY BARBARA.,As from the mighty shelter of his breast
4521,LADY BARBARA.,The Lady Barbara her head uprears
4522,LADY BARBARA.,"With a wan smile, ""Methinks I'm but half blest:"
4523,LADY BARBARA.,"Now when I've found thee, after weary years,"
