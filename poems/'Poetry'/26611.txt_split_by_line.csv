165,ENTHUSIASM.,Oh for the spirit which inspired of old
166,ENTHUSIASM.,The seer's prophetic song--the voice that spake
167,ENTHUSIASM.,Through Israel's warrior king. The strains that burst
168,ENTHUSIASM.,"In thrilling tones from Zion's heaven-strung harp,"
169,ENTHUSIASM.,"Float down the tide of ages, shedding light"
170,ENTHUSIASM.,On pagan shores and nations far remote:
171,ENTHUSIASM.,"Eternal as the God they celebrate,"
172,ENTHUSIASM.,"Their fame shall last when Time's long race is run,"
173,ENTHUSIASM.,"And you refulgent eye of this fair world,--"
174,ENTHUSIASM.,"Its light and centre,--into darkness shrinks,"
175,ENTHUSIASM.,Eclipsed for ever by the glance of Him
176,ENTHUSIASM.,Whose rising sheds abroad eternal day.
177,ENTHUSIASM.,"Almighty, uncreated Source of life!"
178,ENTHUSIASM.,To Thee I dedicate my soul and song;
179,ENTHUSIASM.,In humble adoration bending low
180,ENTHUSIASM.,Before thy footstool. Thou alone canst stamp
181,ENTHUSIASM.,"A lasting glory on the works of man,"
182,ENTHUSIASM.,"Tuning the shepherd's reed, or monarch's harp,"
183,ENTHUSIASM.,To sounds harmonious. Immortality
184,ENTHUSIASM.,Exists alone in Thee. The proudest strain
185,ENTHUSIASM.,"That ever fired the poet's soul, or drew"
186,ENTHUSIASM.,"Melodious breathings from his gifted lyre,"
187,ENTHUSIASM.,"Unsanctioned by thy smile, shall die away"
188,ENTHUSIASM.,Like the faint sound which the soft summer breeze
189,ENTHUSIASM.,Wins from the stately lily's silver bells;
190,ENTHUSIASM.,"A passing murmur, a half-whispered sigh,"
191,ENTHUSIASM.,Heard for a moment in the deep repose
192,ENTHUSIASM.,Of Nature's midnight rest--then hushed for ever!
193,ENTHUSIASM.,"Parent of genius, bright Enthusiasm!"
194,ENTHUSIASM.,"Bold nurse of high resolve and generous thought,"
195,ENTHUSIASM.,'Tis to thy soul-awakening power we owe
196,ENTHUSIASM.,"The preacher's eloquence, the painter's skill,"
197,ENTHUSIASM.,"The poet's lay, the patriot's noble zeal,"
198,ENTHUSIASM.,"The warrior's courage, and the sage's lore."
199,ENTHUSIASM.,"Oh! till the soul is quickened by thy breath,"
200,ENTHUSIASM.,"Wit, wisdom, eloquence, and beauty, fail"
201,ENTHUSIASM.,To make a just impression on the heart;
202,ENTHUSIASM.,"The tide of life creeps lazily along,"
203,ENTHUSIASM.,"Soiled with the stains of earth, and man debased"
204,ENTHUSIASM.,Sinks far below the level of the stream.
205,ENTHUSIASM.,Alas! that thy bright flame should be confined
206,ENTHUSIASM.,To passion's maddening vortex; and the soul
207,ENTHUSIASM.,Waste all its glorious energies on earth!--
208,ENTHUSIASM.,The world allows its votaries to feel
209,ENTHUSIASM.,"A glowing ardour, an intense delight,"
210,ENTHUSIASM.,On every subject but the one that lifts
211,ENTHUSIASM.,"The soul above its sensual, vain pursuits,"
212,ENTHUSIASM.,And elevates the mind and thoughts to God!
213,ENTHUSIASM.,Zeal in a sacred cause alone is deemed
214,ENTHUSIASM.,An aberration of our mental powers.
215,ENTHUSIASM.,The sons of pleasure cannot bear that light
216,ENTHUSIASM.,Of heavenly birth which penetrates the souls
217,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of men, who, deeply conscious of their guilt,"
218,ENTHUSIASM.,"Mourn o'er their lost, degraded state, and seek,"
219,ENTHUSIASM.,"Through faith in Christ's atonement, to regain"
220,ENTHUSIASM.,The glorious liberty of sons of God!
221,ENTHUSIASM.,"Who, as redeemed, account it their chief joy"
222,ENTHUSIASM.,To praise and celebrate the wondrous love
223,ENTHUSIASM.,"That called them out of darkness into light,--"
224,ENTHUSIASM.,"Severed the chain which bound them to the dust,"
225,ENTHUSIASM.,"Unclosed the silent portals of the grave,"
226,ENTHUSIASM.,And gave Hope wings to soar again to heaven!--
227,ENTHUSIASM.,
228,ENTHUSIASM.,"Oh, thou bright spirit, of whose power I sing,"
229,ENTHUSIASM.,"Electric, deathless energy of mind,"
230,ENTHUSIASM.,"Harp of the soul, by genius swept, awake!"
231,ENTHUSIASM.,"Inspire my strains, and aid me to portray"
232,ENTHUSIASM.,The base and joyless vanities which man
233,ENTHUSIASM.,Madly prefers to everlasting bliss!--
234,ENTHUSIASM.,"Come! let us mount gay Fancy's rapid car,"
235,ENTHUSIASM.,And trace through forest and o'er mountain rude
236,ENTHUSIASM.,"The bounding footsteps of the youthful bard,"
237,ENTHUSIASM.,Yet new to life--a stranger to the woes
238,ENTHUSIASM.,His harp is doomed to mourn in plaintive tones.
239,ENTHUSIASM.,"His ardent unsophisticated mind,"
240,ENTHUSIASM.,"On all things beautiful, delighted, dwells."
241,ENTHUSIASM.,Earth is to him a paradise. No cloud
242,ENTHUSIASM.,Floats o'er the golden promise of the morn.
243,ENTHUSIASM.,"Hope daily weaves fresh roses for his brow,"
244,ENTHUSIASM.,"Shrouding the grim and ghastly phantom, Death,"
245,ENTHUSIASM.,Beneath her soft and rainbow-tinted wings.
246,ENTHUSIASM.,Ere Care has tainted with her poisonous breath
247,ENTHUSIASM.,"Life's opening buds, all objects wear to him"
248,ENTHUSIASM.,"A lovely aspect, and he peoples space"
249,ENTHUSIASM.,With creatures of his own. The glorious forms
250,ENTHUSIASM.,"Which haunt his solitude, and brightly fill"
251,ENTHUSIASM.,"Imagination's airy hall, atone"
252,ENTHUSIASM.,For all the faults and follies of his kind.
253,ENTHUSIASM.,Nor marvel that he cannot comprehend
254,ENTHUSIASM.,The speculative aims of worldly men:
255,ENTHUSIASM.,"Dearer to him a leaf, or bursting bud,"
256,ENTHUSIASM.,"Culled fresh from Nature's treasury, than all"
257,ENTHUSIASM.,The golden dreams that cheat the care-worn crowd.
258,ENTHUSIASM.,His world is all within. He mingles not
259,ENTHUSIASM.,In their society; he cannot drudge
260,ENTHUSIASM.,To win the wealth they toil to realize.
261,ENTHUSIASM.,A different spirit animates his breast.
262,ENTHUSIASM.,"Their eager calculations, hopes, and fears,"
263,ENTHUSIASM.,"Still flit before him, like dim shadows thrown"
264,ENTHUSIASM.,"By April's passing clouds upon the stream,"
265,ENTHUSIASM.,"A moment mirrored in its azure depths,"
266,ENTHUSIASM.,Till the next sunbeam turns them into light!--
267,ENTHUSIASM.,
268,ENTHUSIASM.,"Rashly confiding, still to be deceived,"
269,ENTHUSIASM.,Our youthful poet overleaps the bounds
270,ENTHUSIASM.,Of probability. He walks this earth
271,ENTHUSIASM.,"Like an enfranchised spirit; and the storms,"
272,ENTHUSIASM.,"That darken and convulse a guilty world,"
273,ENTHUSIASM.,"Come like faint peals of thunder on his ear,"
274,ENTHUSIASM.,"Or hoarser murmurs of the mighty deep,"
275,ENTHUSIASM.,Which heard in some dark forest's leafy shade
276,ENTHUSIASM.,But add a solemn grandeur to the scene.--
277,ENTHUSIASM.,The genial tide of thought still swiftly flows
278,ENTHUSIASM.,"Rejoicing onward, ere the icy breath"
279,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of sorrow falls upon the sunny fount,"
280,ENTHUSIASM.,And chains the music of its dancing waves.--
281,ENTHUSIASM.,What is the end of all his lovely dreams--
282,ENTHUSIASM.,The bright fulfilment of his earthly hopes?
283,ENTHUSIASM.,"Too often penury and dire disease,"
284,ENTHUSIASM.,"Neglect, a broken heart, an early grave!--"
285,ENTHUSIASM.,"Oh, had he tuned his harp to truths divine,"
286,ENTHUSIASM.,"With saints and martyrs sought a heavenly crown,"
287,ENTHUSIASM.,How had his theme immortalized his song!--
288,ENTHUSIASM.,
289,ENTHUSIASM.,"Behold the man, who to the poet's fire"
290,ENTHUSIASM.,Unites the painter's fascinating art;
291,ENTHUSIASM.,His touch embodies all that fancy brings
292,ENTHUSIASM.,"To charm the mental vision, and he dives"
293,ENTHUSIASM.,"Into the rich and shadowy world of thought,"
294,ENTHUSIASM.,"Soars up to heaven, or plunges down to hell,"
295,ENTHUSIASM.,"In search of forms to mortal eyes unknown,"
296,ENTHUSIASM.,To animate the canvass. His bold eye
297,ENTHUSIASM.,Confronts the king of terrors. Through the gates
298,ENTHUSIASM.,Of that dark prison-house of woe and dread
299,ENTHUSIASM.,"Hails the infernal monarch on his throne,"
300,ENTHUSIASM.,Crowned with ambition's diadem of fire.--
301,ENTHUSIASM.,Unsatisfied with all that Nature gives
302,ENTHUSIASM.,"To charm the wandering heart and roving eye,"
303,ENTHUSIASM.,He would portray Omnipotence.--Rash man!
304,ENTHUSIASM.,Reason revolting shudders at the act.--
305,ENTHUSIASM.,God is a Spirit without form or parts;
306,ENTHUSIASM.,"And canst thou, from a human model, trace"
307,ENTHUSIASM.,The awful grandeur of Creation's King?
308,ENTHUSIASM.,Nature supplies thee with no perfect draught
309,ENTHUSIASM.,Of human beauty in its sinless state.
310,ENTHUSIASM.,"Man bears upon his brow the curse of guilt,"
311,ENTHUSIASM.,"The shadow of mortality, that marks,"
312,ENTHUSIASM.,"E'en in the sunny season of his youth,"
313,ENTHUSIASM.,The melancholy sentence of decay.--
314,ENTHUSIASM.,Is it from such the painter would depict
315,ENTHUSIASM.,"The vision of Jehovah?--and from eyes,"
316,ENTHUSIASM.,"Dimmed with the tears of passion, woe, and pain,"
317,ENTHUSIASM.,"Seek to portray the dread all-seeing eye,"
318,ENTHUSIASM.,Which at a momentary glance can read
319,ENTHUSIASM.,"The inmost secrets of all hearts, and pierce"
320,ENTHUSIASM.,The dark and fathomless abyss of night?
321,ENTHUSIASM.,"Oh, drop the pencil!--Angels cannot gaze"
322,ENTHUSIASM.,"On Him who sits upon the jasper throne,"
323,ENTHUSIASM.,Robed in the splendour of immortal light;
324,ENTHUSIASM.,But cast their crowns before him whilst they veil
325,ENTHUSIASM.,The brow in rapt devotion and adore!--
326,ENTHUSIASM.,
327,ENTHUSIASM.,Nature will furnish subjects far beyond
328,ENTHUSIASM.,"The grasp of human genius. Didst thou e'er,"
329,ENTHUSIASM.,"On mossy bank or grassy plot reclined,"
330,ENTHUSIASM.,Watch the effect of sunlight on the boughs
331,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of some tall graceful ash, or maple tree?"
332,ENTHUSIASM.,Each leaf illumin'd by the noon-tide beam
333,ENTHUSIASM.,Transparent shines.--Anon a heavy cloud
334,ENTHUSIASM.,"Floats for a moment o'er the car of day,"
335,ENTHUSIASM.,And gloom descends upon the forest bowers;
336,ENTHUSIASM.,A ray steals forth--and on the topmost twig
337,ENTHUSIASM.,"Falls, like a silver star. From leaf to leaf"
338,ENTHUSIASM.,"The glory spreads, shoots down the rugged trunk"
339,ENTHUSIASM.,"And gilds each spray, till the whole tree stands forth"
340,ENTHUSIASM.,Arrayed in light.--This is beyond thy art.
341,ENTHUSIASM.,"All thy enthusiasm, all thy boasted skill,"
342,ENTHUSIASM.,But poorly imitates a forest tree.
343,ENTHUSIASM.,
344,ENTHUSIASM.,But let us leave the painter. Let us turn
345,ENTHUSIASM.,"To those, who never swept the sounding lyre"
346,ENTHUSIASM.,"Or grasped the pencil,--ardent minds that hold"
347,ENTHUSIASM.,"A deep communion with the winds and waves,"
348,ENTHUSIASM.,The youthful worshippers at Nature's shrine:
349,ENTHUSIASM.,"What says the soft voice of the plaintive breeze,"
350,ENTHUSIASM.,"Mournfully sweeping through the forest boughs,"
351,ENTHUSIASM.,In airy play moved gently by its breath?
352,ENTHUSIASM.,"To such it hath a language, and it wins"
353,ENTHUSIASM.,A tender echo from the youthful heart.--
354,ENTHUSIASM.,
355,ENTHUSIASM.,With throbbing bosom Nature's student treads
356,ENTHUSIASM.,"The sylvan haunts, exultingly leaps forth"
357,ENTHUSIASM.,"To hail the coming of the genial spring,"
358,ENTHUSIASM.,"Shedding around from her green lap the buds,"
359,ENTHUSIASM.,"In winter's rugged casket long enshrined,"
360,ENTHUSIASM.,To form the chaplet of the infant year.--
361,ENTHUSIASM.,Young pensive moralist!--'tis sweet to muse
362,ENTHUSIASM.,"On beauties which escape the vulgar eye,"
363,ENTHUSIASM.,"To talk with Nature 'mid her woodland paths,"
364,ENTHUSIASM.,And hear an answering voice in every breeze.--
365,ENTHUSIASM.,You court her beauties with a lover's zeal;
366,ENTHUSIASM.,"You hear her voice, nor understand the sound"
367,ENTHUSIASM.,Which speaks to you--to all. The volume spread
368,ENTHUSIASM.,"Before your dazzled eyes, so rich with life,"
369,ENTHUSIASM.,"Is a closed book--a fair illumined scroll,"
370,ENTHUSIASM.,"Traced in strange characters, unknown to you."
371,ENTHUSIASM.,"Would you unfold the mystery, and read"
372,ENTHUSIASM.,The record the eternal hand of God
373,ENTHUSIASM.,"Has, of himself, on Nature's tablets graved?"
374,ENTHUSIASM.,"You must explore another wondrous book,"
375,ENTHUSIASM.,Of deeper interest far--the book of life--
376,ENTHUSIASM.,The glorious volume of unsullied truth!--
377,ENTHUSIASM.,Time's rapid and undeviating march
378,ENTHUSIASM.,"Tramples down empires, blots out names that once"
379,ENTHUSIASM.,Bid fair for perpetuity of fame.
380,ENTHUSIASM.,Truth is alone eternal as the God
381,ENTHUSIASM.,Who on this everlasting basis placed
382,ENTHUSIASM.,His own immutable and moveless throne.
383,ENTHUSIASM.,"Time to these writings daily adds new force,"
384,ENTHUSIASM.,"Deepening the traces of Jehovah's love,"
385,ENTHUSIASM.,"His fathomless, unbounded love to man.--"
386,ENTHUSIASM.,"Peruse this volume, and then walk abroad"
387,ENTHUSIASM.,And meditate in silence on the scenes
388,ENTHUSIASM.,"Which lately charmed your unassisted sense,"
389,ENTHUSIASM.,"Till your soul burns within you, and breaks forth"
390,ENTHUSIASM.,In holy hymns of gratitude and praise.--
391,ENTHUSIASM.,
392,ENTHUSIASM.,"Faith gives a grandeur to created things,"
393,ENTHUSIASM.,"Beyond the poet's lay or painter's art,"
394,ENTHUSIASM.,Or upward flight of Fancy's eagle wing;--
395,ENTHUSIASM.,Earth is the vista through which heaven is seen
396,ENTHUSIASM.,"By him who, journeying through life's narrow vale,"
397,ENTHUSIASM.,Seeks in the objects which around him rise
398,ENTHUSIASM.,To hold communion with his God! to trace
399,ENTHUSIASM.,"The wisdom, goodness, majesty, and love,"
400,ENTHUSIASM.,"That clothed the lilies of the field, and twined"
401,ENTHUSIASM.,"The simple diadem of buds and leaves,"
402,ENTHUSIASM.,"So rich in their diversity of shade,"
403,ENTHUSIASM.,"Round Nature's brow,--and o'er the rugged hills"
404,ENTHUSIASM.,"Cast the light floating veil of purple haze,"
405,ENTHUSIASM.,Which harmonizes to its own soft hue
406,ENTHUSIASM.,The broken precipice and barren heath.
407,ENTHUSIASM.,Here admiration may have ample scope:
408,ENTHUSIASM.,The spirit soaring upward drinks in light
409,ENTHUSIASM.,"From other worlds, and in the choral song"
410,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of happy birds among the forest bowers,"
411,ENTHUSIASM.,Hears the seraphic and harmonious strains
412,ENTHUSIASM.,That angels chant around the eternal throne!--
413,ENTHUSIASM.,"To him there is an anthem in the breeze,"
414,ENTHUSIASM.,"A burst of triumph in the thunder's peal,"
415,ENTHUSIASM.,"Which, slowly rolling through the troubled air,"
416,ENTHUSIASM.,"Strikes man with terror, and yet praises God!--"
417,ENTHUSIASM.,
418,ENTHUSIASM.,"O'er Fancy's glass another shadow flits,"
419,ENTHUSIASM.,Which shows a bolder aspect than the gay
420,ENTHUSIASM.,Impassioned votaries of Nature wear.
421,ENTHUSIASM.,"Mark his majestic port, his eagle eye,"
422,ENTHUSIASM.,"The stern erection of his haughty brow,"
423,ENTHUSIASM.,Partially shaded by the snowy plumes
424,ENTHUSIASM.,That lightly wave and wanton in the breeze.--
425,ENTHUSIASM.,Is this a pensioner of hope?--Is this
426,ENTHUSIASM.,A dreamer of wild dreams?--All eyes are turned
427,ENTHUSIASM.,"To gaze upon him, as with measured step"
428,ENTHUSIASM.,The weaponed warrior slowly passes by.--
429,ENTHUSIASM.,"Oh, this is one of War's tremendous sons,"
430,ENTHUSIASM.,Glory's intrepid champion: his stout heart
431,ENTHUSIASM.,"Leaps, as the war-horse, to the trumpet's sound,"
432,ENTHUSIASM.,And hails the storm of battle from afar.
433,ENTHUSIASM.,"He loves the press, the tumult, and the strife,"
434,ENTHUSIASM.,"Where horror holds the gory steeds of death,"
435,ENTHUSIASM.,And slaughter hews a passage for the brave!--
436,ENTHUSIASM.,He too is an enthusiast!--his zeal
437,ENTHUSIASM.,"Impels him onward with resistless force,"
438,ENTHUSIASM.,"Severs his heart from nature's kindred ties,"
439,ENTHUSIASM.,And feeds the wild ambition which consumes
440,ENTHUSIASM.,All that is good and lovely in his path.
441,ENTHUSIASM.,"He flashes, like a meteor, on the sight,"
442,ENTHUSIASM.,"Seen 'mid the angry thunder-clouds of war,"
443,ENTHUSIASM.,Seeking a living name in fields where Death
444,ENTHUSIASM.,"Holds his imperial banquet, and the blood"
445,ENTHUSIASM.,Of thousands flows to furnish forth the feast.
446,ENTHUSIASM.,
447,ENTHUSIASM.,There was a time when softer feelings held
448,ENTHUSIASM.,Their mild dominion o'er that haughty breast;
449,ENTHUSIASM.,"When at his mother's feet, a rosy boy,"
450,ENTHUSIASM.,"He wove bright garlands for his artless brow,"
451,ENTHUSIASM.,"And sought, with playful dalliance, to detain"
452,ENTHUSIASM.,The busy hand that could not pause to bind
453,ENTHUSIASM.,"His cumbrous wreath, or answer the caress"
454,ENTHUSIASM.,Of him who climbed her knees to steal the kiss.
455,ENTHUSIASM.,"But even at those tender years, his braid"
456,ENTHUSIASM.,Of April blossoms was his crown; the twig
457,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of golden willow, with white daisies bound,"
458,ENTHUSIASM.,"His jewelled sceptre; and the mossy bank,"
459,ENTHUSIASM.,"Where he reclined in floral state, his throne;"
460,ENTHUSIASM.,The lambs that sported in the yellow meads
461,ENTHUSIASM.,His lawful subjects; while his azure eye
462,ENTHUSIASM.,"Looked up to heaven with all a child's delight,"
463,ENTHUSIASM.,And thought that earth was only made for him.--
464,ENTHUSIASM.,"How often has he wept for that fair moon,"
465,ENTHUSIASM.,That shed her trembling glory o'er his path;
466,ENTHUSIASM.,Wearied his slender limbs to reach the spot
467,ENTHUSIASM.,"On which the rainbow based its splendid arch,"
468,ENTHUSIASM.,And felt his heart with disappointment beat
469,ENTHUSIASM.,When the fair pageant faded from his view.--
470,ENTHUSIASM.,
471,ENTHUSIASM.,"Ah, simple boy!--well had it been for thee"
472,ENTHUSIASM.,Had thy ambitious longings been confined
473,ENTHUSIASM.,To objects wisely placed beyond thy grasp.
474,ENTHUSIASM.,But years stole on--thy ardent spirit broke
475,ENTHUSIASM.,"Its childish trammels, and with eager joy"
476,ENTHUSIASM.,"Explored the warlike annals of the past,"
477,ENTHUSIASM.,"And called up spirits of the mighty dead,"
478,ENTHUSIASM.,"To set their hostile armies in array,"
479,ENTHUSIASM.,And fight for thee their sanguine battles o'er.
480,ENTHUSIASM.,"Oh, while such visions burst upon thy sight,"
481,ENTHUSIASM.,Whilst shouts of victory and dying groans
482,ENTHUSIASM.,"Rang on thine ear--time backward rolled his tide,"
483,ENTHUSIASM.,"Rome in her ancient splendour proudly rose,"
484,ENTHUSIASM.,And murdered Cæsar lived again in thee!
485,ENTHUSIASM.,
486,ENTHUSIASM.,Young fiery soldier!--let us track thy steps
487,ENTHUSIASM.,"Through danger's stormy paths, to win the goal"
488,ENTHUSIASM.,Of all thy lofty and ambitious hopes.
489,ENTHUSIASM.,"Wedded to glory, thy brave heart springs forth"
490,ENTHUSIASM.,"To win thy bride from valour's armed hand,"
491,ENTHUSIASM.,And pluck the laurel from the brow of death.
492,ENTHUSIASM.,"A novice in the camp and new to arms,"
493,ENTHUSIASM.,"The bugle lulls thee to repose, the trumpet"
494,ENTHUSIASM.,"Thrills on thy sleeping ear, and bids thee dream"
495,ENTHUSIASM.,Of deathless fields in fancy fought and won.
496,ENTHUSIASM.,At length the day of trial comes--the day
497,ENTHUSIASM.,Which puts thy boasted courage to the proof--
498,ENTHUSIASM.,"Thy first in battle, and perchance thy last."
499,ENTHUSIASM.,"The camp is broken up, the air is rent"
500,ENTHUSIASM.,"With strains of martial music, the loud neigh"
501,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of prancing steeds, impatient for the strife,"
502,ENTHUSIASM.,"With clang of arms, and oft-repeated shouts"
503,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of warriors, who impatiently leap forth"
504,ENTHUSIASM.,With reckless hardihood to meet their doom.
505,ENTHUSIASM.,
506,ENTHUSIASM.,"With beating heart, firm step, and flashing eye,"
507,ENTHUSIASM.,The young recruit of glory proudly grasps
508,ENTHUSIASM.,The standard he must only yield with life.
509,ENTHUSIASM.,The march commences--deep excitement grows
510,ENTHUSIASM.,"To fiery expectation--he forgets,"
511,ENTHUSIASM.,"Amidst the hurried interest of the scene,"
512,ENTHUSIASM.,The crown he fights for only can be won
513,ENTHUSIASM.,Through seas of slaughter and the waste of life.
514,ENTHUSIASM.,Alas! how few devoted hearts like his
515,ENTHUSIASM.,Survive their first engagement with the foe.
516,ENTHUSIASM.,Death strikes the hero to the dust. He falls
517,ENTHUSIASM.,"In honour's mantle, the triumphant cry"
518,ENTHUSIASM.,Of victory on his pallid lip expires!
519,ENTHUSIASM.,"But what are conquests of the bow and spear,"
520,ENTHUSIASM.,"And Alexander's victories, compared"
521,ENTHUSIASM.,With the stern warfare which the soul maintains
522,ENTHUSIASM.,Against the subtle tempter of mankind--
523,ENTHUSIASM.,The base corruptions of a sinful world--
524,ENTHUSIASM.,An evil conscience and a callous heart?
525,ENTHUSIASM.,"Oh, vanquish these!--and through the gates of death"
526,ENTHUSIASM.,Triumphant pass and win a heavenly crown!--
527,ENTHUSIASM.,
528,ENTHUSIASM.,"Oh, that my soul could find a voice to speak;"
529,ENTHUSIASM.,That human language could express the thoughts
530,ENTHUSIASM.,Which fill the secret chambers of the brain.
531,ENTHUSIASM.,In vain the lips pour forth harmonious sounds;
532,ENTHUSIASM.,"In vain the eager eye is raised to heaven,"
533,ENTHUSIASM.,"Swimming in tears, and bright with ecstasy,--"
534,ENTHUSIASM.,"The senses still are debtors to the heart,"
535,ENTHUSIASM.,"Which, trembling, throbs for utterance in vain."
536,ENTHUSIASM.,Does the salvation of a deathless soul
537,ENTHUSIASM.,Kindle no hope in the possessor's breast?
538,ENTHUSIASM.,Awaken no desire to be restored
539,ENTHUSIASM.,To that most pure and perfect state of bliss
540,ENTHUSIASM.,Man by transgression lost?--the noble thought
541,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of claiming kindred with the skies, give birth"
542,ENTHUSIASM.,To no anticipations of delight--
543,ENTHUSIASM.,"Joys such as angels share, and saints, who dwell"
544,ENTHUSIASM.,Within the circle of Jehovah's throne?
545,ENTHUSIASM.,A light is breaking on my mental eye;
546,ENTHUSIASM.,Visions of glory in succession rise
547,ENTHUSIASM.,And fill the airy palace of the soul.
548,ENTHUSIASM.,I see afar the promised land. An arch
549,ENTHUSIASM.,Of golden radiance canopies the gates
550,ENTHUSIASM.,Of that celestial city--Beautiful!
551,ENTHUSIASM.,Unbuilt by hands--the New Jerusalem--
552,ENTHUSIASM.,And holy to the Lord; the happy home
553,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of pilgrims, who to reach that heavenly shrine"
554,ENTHUSIASM.,"Sojourned as strangers on this goodly earth,"
555,ENTHUSIASM.,"Counting all things but loss--yea, life itself--"
556,ENTHUSIASM.,"To win an entrance through those gates of pearl,"
557,ENTHUSIASM.,And dwell within the temple of their God!
558,ENTHUSIASM.,Alas! earth's dusky shadow lies between
559,ENTHUSIASM.,My ardent spirit and that blissful shore:
560,ENTHUSIASM.,"Eye hath not seen, nor mortal ear hath heard,"
561,ENTHUSIASM.,"How then can mortal pen portray, the joys"
562,ENTHUSIASM.,Prepared for those who live and die in Christ!
563,ENTHUSIASM.,
564,ENTHUSIASM.,"Before me flows the rapid stream of time,"
565,ENTHUSIASM.,"Dark, fathomless, encumbered with the wrecks"
566,ENTHUSIASM.,Of twice three thousand years. They too shall sink
567,ENTHUSIASM.,"Beneath those turbid waters, swallowed up"
568,ENTHUSIASM.,In the vast ocean of eternity;
569,ENTHUSIASM.,Leaving few fragments on the boundless waste
570,ENTHUSIASM.,To tell to coming years that such have been.
571,ENTHUSIASM.,"How shall the naked spirit cross the flood,"
572,ENTHUSIASM.,And land in safety on the happy shore?
573,ENTHUSIASM.,'Tis not an earthly pilot that can steer
574,ENTHUSIASM.,So frail a bark through such a stormy tide.
575,ENTHUSIASM.,Cannot the eye of faith look up and see
576,ENTHUSIASM.,The clouds of sorrow part--the day-star rise
577,ENTHUSIASM.,"Above life's trackless ocean, shedding light"
578,ENTHUSIASM.,Upon the darkened nations? From its beams
579,ENTHUSIASM.,"The mist of error flies, the angry waves"
580,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of passion, which so long have vexed the world,"
581,ENTHUSIASM.,Are hushed to rest; controlled by Him who rose
582,ENTHUSIASM.,"From tranquil sleep, and to the roaring waste"
583,ENTHUSIASM.,"Of midnight waters, mustering all their wrath,"
584,ENTHUSIASM.,"Said, ""Peace, be still."" The howling winds obeyed,"
585,ENTHUSIASM.,And silence sank upon the storm-tossed main!--
586,ENTHUSIASM.,
587,ENTHUSIASM.,Oh look to Him! and to his glorious word.
588,ENTHUSIASM.,His universal sovereignty demands
589,ENTHUSIASM.,That deep devotion of the heart which men
590,ENTHUSIASM.,Miscall enthusiasm!--Zeal alone deserves
591,ENTHUSIASM.,The name of madness in a worldly cause.
592,ENTHUSIASM.,Light misdirected ever leads astray;
593,ENTHUSIASM.,But hope inspired by faith will guide to heaven!
594,ENTHUSIASM.,To win the laurel wreath the soldier fights;
595,ENTHUSIASM.,To free his native land the patriot bleeds;
596,ENTHUSIASM.,And to secure his crown the martyr dies!
597,ENTHUSIASM.,For beauteous Rachel Isaac's son endured
598,ENTHUSIASM.,"Seven years of bitter servitude, and deemed"
599,ENTHUSIASM.,The weary months but moments to obtain
600,ENTHUSIASM.,From crafty Laban's hand his promised bride.
601,ENTHUSIASM.,"To prove his friendship for the man he loved,"
602,ENTHUSIASM.,The generous Jonathan forgot his claims
603,ENTHUSIASM.,"To royalty, intent to save the life"
604,ENTHUSIASM.,Of him whom God had called to fill his throne.
605,ENTHUSIASM.,And wilt thou feel less zealous to regain
606,ENTHUSIASM.,"The love and favour of thy heavenly King,"
607,ENTHUSIASM.,And shrink because the path to glory lies
608,ENTHUSIASM.,"Up the steep hill of duty? He who saved,"
609,ENTHUSIASM.,"Amidst the tempest on Gennesaret,"
610,ENTHUSIASM.,"Peter, when sinking in the waves, will aid"
611,ENTHUSIASM.,"Thy feeble steps, and guide thee to the rock"
612,ENTHUSIASM.,Of everlasting strength!--
613,ENTHUSIASM.,
614,ENTHUSIASM.,Spirit divine!
615,ENTHUSIASM.,"Whose name I erst invoked, whose influence fills"
616,ENTHUSIASM.,"The narrow confines of this human breast,--"
617,ENTHUSIASM.,"If I have dared to sing of truths sublime,"
618,ENTHUSIASM.,"Oh, shed a glory round my rugged lyre--"
619,ENTHUSIASM.,Hallow the feeble strains that would reveal
620,ENTHUSIASM.,"The dazzling light, which streaming from thy wings,"
621,ENTHUSIASM.,Gilds all the dark and troubled tide of thought.
622,ENTHUSIASM.,Lifted by thee above the gulf of time
623,ENTHUSIASM.,"My eye explores the regions of the blessed,"
624,ENTHUSIASM.,And hopes long chained to earth are raised to heaven.
625,ENTHUSIASM.,"Never, while reason holds her steady rein,"
626,ENTHUSIASM.,"To curb imagination's fiery steeds,"
627,ENTHUSIASM.,May I to joyless apathy resign
628,ENTHUSIASM.,The high and holy thoughts inspired by thee!
629,ENTHUSIASM.,
630,ENTHUSIASM.,
631,ENTHUSIASM.,
632,ENTHUSIASM.,
633,FAME.,FAME.
634,FAME.,
635,FAME.,
636,FAME.,Oh ye! who all life's energies combine
637,FAME.,"The fadeless laurel round your brows to twine,"
638,FAME.,"Pause but one moment in your brief career,"
639,FAME.,Nor seek for glory in a mortal sphere.
640,FAME.,Can figures traced upon the shifting sand
641,FAME.,"Washed by the mighty tide, its force withstand?"
642,FAME.,"Time's stern resistless torrent onward flows,"
643,FAME.,"The restless waves above your labours close,"
644,FAME.,And He who bids the bounding billows roll
645,FAME.,Sweeps out the feeble record from the soul.
646,FAME.,
647,FAME.,The glorious hues that flush the evening sky
648,FAME.,"Melt into night, and on her bosom die;"
649,FAME.,Through the wide fields of heaven's immensity
650,FAME.,The gold-tipped billows of that crimson sea
651,FAME.,"Flash on the awe-struck gazer's dazzled sight,"
652,FAME.,The rich out-gushings from the fount of light;
653,FAME.,"Yet oft, concealed beneath that splendid form,"
654,FAME.,We hail the herald of the coming storm;
655,FAME.,The fiery spirit over half a globe
656,FAME.,"Spreads the bright tissue of his beamy robe,"
657,FAME.,"And, ere the day-king veils his glowing crest,"
658,FAME.,Shrouds the dark tempest in his burning vest;
659,FAME.,"O'er earth and heaven his gorgeous banner flings,"
660,FAME.,And gilds with borrowed light his sable wings--
661,FAME.,And those who view with rapture-lifted eyes
662,FAME.,"The short-lived pageant of the summer skies,"
663,FAME.,"Behold it vanish like a fearful dream,"
664,FAME.,And death and desolation mar its beam.
665,FAME.,So when we seek above life's sea of tears
666,FAME.,"To raise a monument for future years,"
667,FAME.,"If built on earth the fabric will decay,"
668,FAME.,Oblivion's hand will sweep the pile away;
669,FAME.,The proudest trophies of the mightiest mind
670,FAME.,"Fade in her grasp, nor leave a wreck behind;"
671,FAME.,"She o'er earth's ruins spreads her misty pall,"
672,FAME.,And time's unsparing ocean swallows all;
673,FAME.,"Hope for a moment gilds the spoiler's shroud,"
674,FAME.,As parting sunbeams tinge the lurid cloud;
675,FAME.,The transient glory cheats the gazer's sight;
676,FAME.,The storm rolls on--'tis universal night!
677,FAME.,
678,FAME.,"Say did not man inherit, at his birth,"
679,FAME.,A higher promise than the things of earth;
680,FAME.,"Views more exalted than this world can give,"
681,FAME.,"And hopes that, deathless as the soul, outlive"
682,FAME.,"The wreck of nature, and the common doom"
683,FAME.,That hourly sweeps her myriads to the tomb?
684,FAME.,"His mental powers, unfettered by the clod,"
685,FAME.,"Soar o'er time's gulf, and reach the throne of God."
686,FAME.,Oh what a privilege it is to know
687,FAME.,That death chains not the immortal soul below!
688,FAME.,"Through the dark portals of the grave upborne,"
689,FAME.,"Leaving the care-worn sons of earth to mourn,"
690,FAME.,On wings of light the new-born spirit flies
691,FAME.,To seek a home and kindred in the skies.
692,FAME.,
693,FAME.,"Oh what are earthly crowns and earthly bliss,"
694,FAME.,"And pride's delusive dreams, compared with this?"
695,FAME.,"Ambition's laurel, purchased with a flood"
696,FAME.,"Of human tears and stained with kindred blood,"
697,FAME.,"Once gained, converted to a crown of thorns,"
698,FAME.,Pierces the aching temples it adorns--
699,FAME.,"Not Sappho's lyre, nor Raphael's deathless art"
700,FAME.,Can twine the olive round the bleeding heart;
701,FAME.,"In heaven alone the promised blessing lies,"
702,FAME.,And those who seek--must seek it in the skies!
703,FAME.,"Seek it through Him who, humbling human pride,"
704,FAME.,"Wept o'er man's fall, and for his ransom died;"
705,FAME.,"Poured out his blood on the accursed tree,"
706,FAME.,To break the chain and set the captive free.
707,FAME.,Heaven bowed its glory on the cross to teach
708,FAME.,"That greatness man's lost nature could not reach,"
709,FAME.,"The true humility, which stoops to rise,"
710,FAME.,"And, leaving earth, claims kindred with the skies."
711,FAME.,
712,FAME.,How many pages have been blotted o'er
713,FAME.,"With heartfelt tears, that now are read no more;"
714,FAME.,"And, like the eyes that long have ceased to weep,"
715,FAME.,In dust and darkness quite forgotten sleep!
716,FAME.,Dead to the world as if they ne'er had been
717,FAME.,The favoured actors in one little scene.
718,FAME.,"The scene is changed--and, like their fleeting-fame,"
719,FAME.,The fickle world adores another name.
720,FAME.,They knew the price at which its praise was bought;
721,FAME.,The glittering bauble was not worth a thought;
722,FAME.,"Yet, Esau like, a better birthright sold,"
723,FAME.,And for base counterfeit exchanged the gold!
724,FAME.,
725,FAME.,"Ere man presumptuously his genius boasts,"
726,FAME.,"Let him reflect upon the countless hosts,"
727,FAME.,"The untold myriads, of each age and clime,"
728,FAME.,That sleep forgotten in the grave of time.
729,FAME.,What were their names! Go ask the silent sod
730,FAME.,Their deeds--their record lives but with their God!
731,FAME.,"At every step we tread on kindred earth,"
732,FAME.,Nor know the spot that gave our fathers birth.
733,FAME.,Oh! could we call before our wondering eyes
734,FAME.,"All that have lived--and bid the dead arise,"
735,FAME.,From the first moment the Creator spoke
736,FAME.,"The word of power, and light through darkness broke,"
737,FAME.,And see earth covered with the mighty tide
738,FAME.,"Of all who on her bosom lived and died,"
739,FAME.,What a stupendous thought would fill the soul
740,FAME.,Could we behold life's breathing ocean roll
741,FAME.,Its human billows onward--and the mass
742,FAME.,"The grave has swallowed, down from Adam, pass"
743,FAME.,In one unbroken stream--the brain would reel--
744,FAME.,"Lost in immensity, would cease to feel!"
745,FAME.,"Whilst living, ah, how few were known to fame!"
746,FAME.,"One in a million has not left a name,--"
747,FAME.,"A single token, on life's shifting scene,"
748,FAME.,To tell to other years that such has been.
749,FAME.,"Yet man, unaided by a hope sublime,"
750,FAME.,Thinks that his puny arm can cope with time;
751,FAME.,"That his vast genius can reverse the doom,"
752,FAME.,And shed a deathless light upon his tomb;
753,FAME.,"That distant ages shall his worth admire,"
754,FAME.,And young hearts kindle at the sacred fire
755,FAME.,"Of him whose fame no envious clouds o'ercast,"
756,FAME.,Yet died forgotten and unknown at last.
757,FAME.,
758,FAME.,"Oh think not genius, with its hallowed light,"
759,FAME.,Can break the gloom of an eternal night;
760,FAME.,For splendid talents often lead astray
761,FAME.,"The unguarded heart, and hide the narrow way,"
762,FAME.,"While the unlearned and those of low estate,"
763,FAME.,"With faith's clear eye behold the living gate,"
764,FAME.,Whose portals open on the shoreless sea
765,FAME.,Where time's strong ocean meets eternity.
766,FAME.,Across the gulf that stretches far beneath
767,FAME.,Lies the dark valley of the shade of death--
768,FAME.,"A land of deep forgetfulness,--a shore"
769,FAME.,"Which all must traverse, but return no more"
770,FAME.,"To this sad earth, to dissipate our dread,"
771,FAME.,And tell the mighty secrets of the dead.
772,FAME.,Enough for us that those drear realms were trod
773,FAME.,"By heavenly footsteps, that the Son of God"
774,FAME.,"Passed the dark bourne and vanquished Death, to save"
775,FAME.,The weary wanderers of life's stormy wave.
776,FAME.,
777,FAME.,Why then should man thus cleave to things of earth?
778,FAME.,Daily experience proves their little worth--
779,FAME.,"Or waste those noble qualities of mind,"
780,FAME.,"For wise and better purposes designed,"
781,FAME.,"In the pursuit of trifles, which confer"
782,FAME.,No solid pleasure on their worshipper;
783,FAME.,Or in the search of causes that are known
784,FAME.,And guided by Omnipotence alone?
785,FAME.,"A height his finite reason cannot reach,"
786,FAME.,And all his boasted learning fails to teach?
787,FAME.,"While the bewildering thought overwhelms his brain,"
788,FAME.,Death comes to prove his speculations vain!
789,FAME.,
790,FAME.,Is he deserving of a better doom
791,FAME.,Who will not raise a hope beyond the tomb?
792,FAME.,"Who, quite enamoured with his fallen state,"
793,FAME.,Clings to the world and leaves the rest to fate;
794,FAME.,"Prefers corruption to his Maker's smile,"
795,FAME.,"""And shuns the light because his deeds are vile?"""
796,FAME.,"The man who feels the value of his soul,"
797,FAME.,Presses unwearied towards a higher goal;
798,FAME.,"Leaving this earth, he seeks a brighter prize,"
799,FAME.,And claims a crown immortal in the skies.
800,FAME.,"The child of pleasure may despise his aim,"
801,FAME.,"And heap reproach upon the Christian's name,"
802,FAME.,"May laugh his faith, as foolishness, to scorn:--"
803,FAME.,These by the man of God are meekly borne.
804,FAME.,His glorious hope no infidel can shake;
805,FAME.,He suffers calmly for his Saviour's sake.--
806,FAME.,
807,FAME.,The world's poor votary seeks in vain for peace:
808,FAME.,He cannot bid the voice of conscience cease
809,FAME.,Its dire upbraidings; in his heartless course
810,FAME.,"He meets at every turn the fiend Remorse,"
811,FAME.,"Who glares upon him with her tearless eye,"
812,FAME.,That sears his heart--but mocks its agony.
813,FAME.,"He hears that voice, amid the festive throng,"
814,FAME.,"Speak in the dance and murmur in the song,"
815,FAME.,"A death-bell, pealing in the midnight chime,"
816,FAME.,"Whose awful tones proclaim the lapse of time,"
817,FAME.,And e'en the winged moments as they fly
818,FAME.,"Seem to proclaim--""Rash mortal, thou must die!"
819,FAME.,"Soon must thou tread the path thy fathers trod,"
820,FAME.,"And stand before the judgment-seat of God!""--"
821,FAME.,He hears--but seeks in pleasure's cup to drown
822,FAME.,The dread that weighs his ardent spirit down;
823,FAME.,Derides the warning voice in mercy sent;
824,FAME.,Rejects the thought of after-punishment;
825,FAME.,"In folly's vortex wastes the spring of youth,"
826,FAME.,"Nor, till death summons, owns the awful truth;"
827,FAME.,Feels it too late to calm the agonies
828,FAME.,"Remorse has kindled--and despairing, dies!"
829,FAME.,
830,FAME.,But in the breast where true religion reigns
831,FAME.,There is a balm for all these mental pains;
832,FAME.,"A sweet contentment, felt, but undefined,"
833,FAME.,A full and free surrender of the mind
834,FAME.,To its divine-original; a trust
835,FAME.,Which lifts to heaven the dweller of the dust.
836,FAME.,"The pilgrim, glowing with a hope divine,"
837,FAME.,Counts not the distance to the heavenly shrine;
838,FAME.,"He meets with guardian spirits on the road,"
839,FAME.,Who cheer his steps and ease his heavy load.
840,FAME.,Serenely journeying to a better clime
841,FAME.,He does not shudder at the lapse of time;
842,FAME.,"But calmly drinks the cup of mortal woe,"
843,FAME.,And finds that peace the world cannot bestow;
844,FAME.,"That promised joy which brightens all beneath,"
845,FAME.,And smooths his pillow on the bed of death;
846,FAME.,"That perfect love which casteth out all fear,"
847,FAME.,And wafts his spirit to a happier sphere!--
848,FAME.,
849,FAME.,Fame is a dream--the praise of man as brief
850,FAME.,As morning dew upon the folded leaf;
851,FAME.,"The summer sun exhales the pearly tear,"
852,FAME.,And leaves no trace of its existence there.
853,FAME.,"Seek not for immortality below,"
854,FAME.,"But fix your hopes beyond this vale of woe,"
855,FAME.,"That when oblivion gathers round thy sod,"
856,FAME.,A lasting record may be found with God!--
857,FAME.,

868,THE DELUGE.,Creatures of that elder world
869,THE DELUGE.,"Now in dust and darkness hurled,"

871,THE DELUGE.,Of a long forsaken God!
872,THE DELUGE.,

884,THE DELUGE.,"War-chief with his lifted lance,--"
885,THE DELUGE.,"Beauty with her jewelled brow,"
886,THE DELUGE.,Hoary age with locks of snow:
887,THE DELUGE.,"Prince, and peer, and statesman grave,"
888,THE DELUGE.,"White-stoled priest, and dark-browed slave,--"
889,THE DELUGE.,"Plumed helm, and crowned head,"
890,THE DELUGE.,By one mighty impulse led--
891,THE DELUGE.,"Mingle in the living mass,"
892,THE DELUGE.,That onward to the desert pass!
893,THE DELUGE.,
894,THE DELUGE.,"With song and shout and impious glee,"
895,THE DELUGE.,What rush earth's myriads forth to see?
896,THE DELUGE.,Hark! the sultry air is rent
897,THE DELUGE.,With their boisterous merriment!
898,THE DELUGE.,"Are they to the vineyards rushing,"
899,THE DELUGE.,Where the grape's rich blood is gushing?
900,THE DELUGE.,Or hurrying to the bridal rite
901,THE DELUGE.,Of warrior brave and beauty bright?
902,THE DELUGE.,"Ah no! those heads in mockery crowned,"
903,THE DELUGE.,"Those pennons gay with roses bound,"
904,THE DELUGE.,Hie not to a scene of gladness--
905,THE DELUGE.,Theirs is mirth that ends in madness!
906,THE DELUGE.,All recklessly they rush to hear
907,THE DELUGE.,"The dark words of that gifted seer,"
908,THE DELUGE.,Who amid a guilty race
909,THE DELUGE.,Favour found and saving grace;
910,THE DELUGE.,Rescued from the doom that hurled
911,THE DELUGE.,To chaos back a sinful world.--
912,THE DELUGE.,"Self-polluted, lost, debased,"
913,THE DELUGE.,"Every noble trait effaced,"

918,THE DELUGE.,"Alas! all fatally opposed,"
919,THE DELUGE.,The heart of erring man is closed
920,THE DELUGE.,"Against that warning, and he deems"
921,THE DELUGE.,"The prophet's counsel idle dreams,"
922,THE DELUGE.,And laughs to hear the preacher rave
923,THE DELUGE.,Of bursting cloud and whelming wave!
924,THE DELUGE.,
925,THE DELUGE.,Tremble Earth! the awful doom
926,THE DELUGE.,That sweeps thy millions to the tomb
927,THE DELUGE.,"Hangs darkly o'er thee,--and the train"

929,THE DELUGE.,Shall never raise those laughing eyes
930,THE DELUGE.,To welcome summer's cloudless skies;
931,THE DELUGE.,Shall never see the golden beam
932,THE DELUGE.,"Of day light up the wood and stream,"
933,THE DELUGE.,Or the rich and ripened corn
934,THE DELUGE.,"Waving in the breath of morn,"
935,THE DELUGE.,Or their rosy children twine
936,THE DELUGE.,Chaplets of the clustering vine:--
937,THE DELUGE.,The bow is bent! the shaft is sped!

939,THE DELUGE.,
940,THE DELUGE.,What arrests their frantic course?

944,THE DELUGE.,Lips are quivering--cheeks are pale--
945,THE DELUGE.,Palsied limbs all trembling fail;
946,THE DELUGE.,Eyes with bursting terror gaze
947,THE DELUGE.,"On the sun's portentous blaze,"
948,THE DELUGE.,"Through the wide horizon gleaming,"

951,THE DELUGE.,"Armed for elemental war,"
952,THE DELUGE.,"Clouds in quick succession rise,"
953,THE DELUGE.,Darkness spreads o'er all the skies;

969,THE DELUGE.,Hark! that loud tremendous roar!
970,THE DELUGE.,"Ocean overleaps the shore,"
971,THE DELUGE.,Pouring all his giant waves
972,THE DELUGE.,O'er the fated land of graves;
973,THE DELUGE.,"Where his white-robed spirit glides,"

3399,THE DREAM.,
3400,THE DREAM.,
3401,THE DREAM.,"Methought last night I saw thee lowly laid,"
3402,THE DREAM.,"Thy pallid cheek yet paler, on the bier;"
3403,THE DREAM.,And scattered round thee many a lovely braid
3404,THE DREAM.,"Of flowers, the brightest of the closing year;"
3405,THE DREAM.,"Whilst on thy lips the placid smile that played,"
3406,THE DREAM.,"Proved thy soul's exit to a happier sphere,"
3407,THE DREAM.,In silent eloquence reproaching those
3408,THE DREAM.,Who watched in agony thy last repose.
3409,THE DREAM.,
3410,THE DREAM.,"A pensive, wandering, melancholy light"
3411,THE DREAM.,"The moon's pale radiance on thy features cast,"
3412,THE DREAM.,"Which, through the awful stillness of the night,"
3413,THE DREAM.,"Gleamed like some lovely vision of the past,"
3414,THE DREAM.,"Recalling hopes once beautiful and bright,"
3415,THE DREAM.,"Now, like that struggling beam, receding fast,"
3416,THE DREAM.,"Which o'er the scene a softening glory shed,"
3417,THE DREAM.,And kissed the brow of the unconscious dead.
3418,THE DREAM.,
3419,THE DREAM.,"Yes--it was thou!--and we were doomed to part,"
3420,THE DREAM.,Never in this wide world to meet again.
3421,THE DREAM.,"The blow that levelled thee was in my heart,"
3422,THE DREAM.,And thrilled my breast with more than mortal pain.
3423,THE DREAM.,Despair forbade the gathering tears to start;
3424,THE DREAM.,But soon the gushing torrents fell like rain
3425,THE DREAM.,"O'er thy pale form, as free and unrepressed"
3426,THE DREAM.,As the rash shower that rocks the storm to rest.
3427,THE DREAM.,
3428,THE DREAM.,"For all this goodly earth contained for me,"
3429,THE DREAM.,"Of bright or beautiful, lay withering there:"
3430,THE DREAM.,What were its gayest scenes bereft of thee--
3431,THE DREAM.,What were its joys in which thou couldst not share?
3432,THE DREAM.,"While memory recalled each spot, where we"
3433,THE DREAM.,"Had twined together many a garland fair,"
3434,THE DREAM.,"Of hope's own wreathing, and the summer hours"
3435,THE DREAM.,"Smiled not on happier, gayer hearts than ours."
3436,THE DREAM.,
3437,THE DREAM.,"Hearts, chilled and silent, as the pensive beam,"
3438,THE DREAM.,"Whose shadowy glory resting on the pall,"
3439,THE DREAM.,"Casts on the dead a sad portentous gleam,"
3440,THE DREAM.,"And serves past hours of rapture to recall,"
3441,THE DREAM.,"Till the soul roused herself with one wild scream,"
3442,THE DREAM.,"As shuddering nature felt the powerful call,"

3451,THE RUIN.,
3452,THE RUIN.,"I know a cliff, whose steep and craggy brow"
3453,THE RUIN.,"O'erlooks the troubled ocean, and spurns back"
3454,THE RUIN.,The advancing billow from its rugged base;
3455,THE RUIN.,Yet many a goodly rood of land lies deep
3456,THE RUIN.,"Beneath the wild wave buried, which rolls on"
3457,THE RUIN.,Its course exulting o'er the prostrate towers
3458,THE RUIN.,"Of high cathedral--church--and abbey fair,--"
3459,THE RUIN.,Lifting its loud and everlasting voice
3460,THE RUIN.,"Over the ruins, which its depths enshroud,"
3461,THE RUIN.,"As if it called on Time, to render back"
3462,THE RUIN.,"The things that were, and give to life again"
3463,THE RUIN.,All that in dark oblivion sleeps below:--
3464,THE RUIN.,Perched on the summit of that lofty cliff
3465,THE RUIN.,"A time-worn edifice o'erlooks the wave,"
3466,THE RUIN.,"""Which greets the fisher's home-returning bark,"""
3467,THE RUIN.,And the young seaman checks his blithesome song
3468,THE RUIN.,To hail the lonely ruin from the deep.
3469,THE RUIN.,
3470,THE RUIN.,"Majestic in decay, that roofless pile"
3471,THE RUIN.,"Survives the wreck of ages, rising still"
3472,THE RUIN.,"A mournful beacon o'er the sea of time,"
3473,THE RUIN.,The lonely record of departed years:--
3474,THE RUIN.,Yes--those who view that ruin feel an awe
3475,THE RUIN.,"Sink in the heart, like those who look on death"
3476,THE RUIN.,"For the first time, and hear within the soul"
3477,THE RUIN.,"A voice of warning whisper,--""Thus, e'en thus,"
3478,THE RUIN.,"All human glories perish--rent from time,"
3479,THE RUIN.,"And swallowed up in that unmeasured void,"
3480,THE RUIN.,"O'er which oblivion rolls his sable tide.""--"
3481,THE RUIN.,Such thoughts as these that moss-grown pile calls forth
3482,THE RUIN.,"To those who gaze upon its shattered walls,"
3483,THE RUIN.,"Or, musing, tread its grass-grown aisles, or pause"
3484,THE RUIN.,"To contemplate the wide and barren heath,"
3485,THE RUIN.,"Spreading in rude magnificence around,"
3486,THE RUIN.,With scarce a tree or shrub to intersect
3487,THE RUIN.,"Its gloomy aspect, save the noble ash"
3488,THE RUIN.,"That fronts the ruins, on whose hoary trunk"
3489,THE RUIN.,"The hurricanes of years have vainly burst,"
3490,THE RUIN.,"To mar its beauty;--there sublime it stands,"
3491,THE RUIN.,Waving its graceful branches o'er the soil
3492,THE RUIN.,That wraps the mouldering children of the land.
3493,THE RUIN.,
3494,THE RUIN.,The shadowy splendour of an autumn sky
3495,THE RUIN.,Was radiant with the hues of parting day;
3496,THE RUIN.,"The glorious sun seemed loth to leave the west,"
3497,THE RUIN.,That glowed like molten gold--a saffron sea
3498,THE RUIN.,"Fretted with crimson billows, whose rich tints"
3499,THE RUIN.,Gave to the rugged cliff and barren heath
3500,THE RUIN.,A ruddy diadem of living light!
3501,THE RUIN.,
3502,THE RUIN.,Hark!--'tis the lonely genius of the place
3503,THE RUIN.,Sighs through the wind-stirred branches and bewails
3504,THE RUIN.,"Its desolation to the moaning blast,"
3505,THE RUIN.,That sweeps the ivy on the dark gray walls!--
3506,THE RUIN.,No--'twas a sound of bitter agony
3507,THE RUIN.,"Wrung from the depths of some o'erburdened heart,"
3508,THE RUIN.,Which in life's early morning had received
3509,THE RUIN.,A sad inheritance of sighs and tears.
3510,THE RUIN.,
3511,THE RUIN.,"Starting, I turned--and seated on the ground"
3512,THE RUIN.,Beside the broken altar I beheld
3513,THE RUIN.,"A female figure, whose fantastic dress"
3514,THE RUIN.,And hair enwreathed with sprigs of ash and yew
3515,THE RUIN.,Bespoke a mind in ruins. On her brow
3516,THE RUIN.,Despair had stamped his iron seal; her cheek
3517,THE RUIN.,Was pale as moonlight on the misty wave;
3518,THE RUIN.,"Her hollow eyes were fixed on vacancy,"
3519,THE RUIN.,Or wildly sent their hurried glances round
3520,THE RUIN.,"With quick impatient gesture, as in quest"
3521,THE RUIN.,"Of some loved object, present to her mind,"
3522,THE RUIN.,But shut for ever from her longing view.
3523,THE RUIN.,
3524,THE RUIN.,The sun went down. She slowly left her seat
3525,THE RUIN.,And cast one long sad look upon the wave;
3526,THE RUIN.,Then poured the anguish of her breaking heart
3527,THE RUIN.,"In a low plaintive strain of melody,"
3528,THE RUIN.,"That rose and died away upon the breeze,"
3529,THE RUIN.,The mournful requiem of her perished hopes:--
3530,THE RUIN.,
3531,THE RUIN.,Hark! the restless spirits of ocean sigh;
3532,THE RUIN.,I can hear them speak as the wind sweeps by.
3533,THE RUIN.,"See, the ivy has heard their mystic call,"
3534,THE RUIN.,"And shivering clings to the broken wall,"
3535,THE RUIN.,"The dark green leaves take a sadder shade,"
3536,THE RUIN.,And the flowers turn pale and begin to fade;
3537,THE RUIN.,"The landscape grows dim in the deepening gloom,"
3538,THE RUIN.,And the dead awake in the silent tomb.
3539,THE RUIN.,"I have watched the return of my true-love's bark,"
3540,THE RUIN.,From the sun's uprising till midnight dark;
3541,THE RUIN.,"I have watched and wept through the weary day,"
3542,THE RUIN.,But his ship on the deep is far away;
3543,THE RUIN.,I have gazed for hours on the whitening track
3544,THE RUIN.,"Of the pathless waters, and called him back,"
3545,THE RUIN.,"But my voice returned on the moaning blast,"
3546,THE RUIN.,And the vessel I sought still glided past.
3547,THE RUIN.,
3548,THE RUIN.,We parted on just such a lovely night:
3549,THE RUIN.,"The billows were tossing in cloudless light,"
3550,THE RUIN.,And the full bright moon on the waters slept;
3551,THE RUIN.,"And the stars above us their vigils kept,"
3552,THE RUIN.,"And the surges whispered a lullaby,"
3553,THE RUIN.,As low and as sweet as a lover's sigh--
3554,THE RUIN.,"And he promised, as gently he pressed my hand,"
3555,THE RUIN.,He would soon return to his native land.
3556,THE RUIN.,
3557,THE RUIN.,"But long months have fled, and this burning brain"
3558,THE RUIN.,Is seared with weeping and watching in vain.
3559,THE RUIN.,"A dark dark shade on my bosom lies,"
3560,THE RUIN.,And nights of sorrow have dimmed these eyes;
3561,THE RUIN.,"The roses have fled from my pallid cheek,"
3562,THE RUIN.,And the grief that I feel no words can speak;
3563,THE RUIN.,"I have made my home with the graves of the dead,"
3564,THE RUIN.,And the cold earth pillows my aching head!
3565,THE RUIN.,
3566,THE RUIN.,He will come!--he will come!--I know it now;
3567,THE RUIN.,The waves are dancing before his prow;
3568,THE RUIN.,"He comes to speak peace to my aching heart,"
3569,THE RUIN.,To tell me we never again shall part;
3570,THE RUIN.,"I can hear his voice in the freshening breeze,"
3571,THE RUIN.,"As his bark glides o'er the rippling seas,"
3572,THE RUIN.,"And my heart will break forth into laughter and song,"
3573,THE RUIN.,When I lead him back through the gazing throng.
3574,THE RUIN.,
3575,THE RUIN.,"Ah, no--where yon shade on the water lies"
3576,THE RUIN.,"The slow-rising moon deceives my eyes,"
3577,THE RUIN.,And the tide of sorrow within my breast
3578,THE RUIN.,Rolls on like the billows that never rest;
3579,THE RUIN.,"I will look no more on the heaving deep,"
3580,THE RUIN.,But return to my lowly bed and weep:
3581,THE RUIN.,"He will come to my dreams in the darksome night,"
3582,THE RUIN.,And his bark will be here with the dawn of light!
3583,THE RUIN.,
3584,THE RUIN.,"When the song ceased, she turned her heavy eyes"
3585,THE RUIN.,With such a piteous glance upon my face;
3586,THE RUIN.,"It pierced my heart, and fast the gathering tears"
3587,THE RUIN.,Blinded my sight. Alas! poor maniac;
3588,THE RUIN.,For thee no hope shall dawn--no tender thought
3589,THE RUIN.,Wake in thy blighted heart a thrill of joy.
3590,THE RUIN.,"The immortal mind is levelled with the dust,"
3591,THE RUIN.,Ere the tenacious cords of life give way.
3592,THE RUIN.,Hers was a common tale--she early owned
3593,THE RUIN.,"The ardent love that youthful spirits feel,"
3594,THE RUIN.,And gave her soul in blind idolatry
3595,THE RUIN.,To one dear object; and his ship was lost
3596,THE RUIN.,In sight of port--lost on the very morn
3597,THE RUIN.,That should have smiled upon their bridal rite.
3598,THE RUIN.,She saw the dreadful accident like one
3599,THE RUIN.,Who saw it not; and from that fatal hour
3600,THE RUIN.,"All memory of it faded from her mind,"
3601,THE RUIN.,And still she watches for the distant sail
3602,THE RUIN.,"Of him, who never, never can return!"
3603,THE RUIN.,
3604,THE RUIN.,"Poor stricken maid! thy best affections,"
3605,THE RUIN.,"Thy hopes, thy wishes centred all in earth--"
3606,THE RUIN.,Earth has repaid thee with a broken heart!
3607,THE RUIN.,"Love to thy God had known no rash excess,"
3608,THE RUIN.,For in his service there is joy and peace;
3609,THE RUIN.,"A light, which on thy troubled mind had shed"
3610,THE RUIN.,"Its holy influence, and those tearful eyes"
3611,THE RUIN.,"Had then been raised in gratitude to heaven,"
3612,THE RUIN.,Nor chased delusive phantoms o'er the deep!

3662,THE WIND FROST.,The sallow leaves from the groaning bough;

3781,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,
3782,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,There's joy in childhood's merry voice
3783,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,When the laugh rings blithe and clear;
3784,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,And the sounds that bid young hearts rejoice
3785,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,Are music to the ear.
3786,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"There's joy in the dreams of early youth,"
3787,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,Ere care has cast a shade
3788,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"O'er scenes which, though drest in the guise of truth,"
3789,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,Our reason dooms to fade.
3790,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,
3791,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,There's joy in the youthful lover's breast
3792,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"When his bride by the altar stands,"
3793,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,When his trembling lip to hers is pressed
3794,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,And the priest has joined their hands.
3795,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,There's joy in the smiling mother's heart
3796,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"When she clasps her first-born son,"
3797,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,When the holy tears of rapture start
3798,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,To bless the lovely one.
3799,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,
3800,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,There's joy when the war-worn soldier hears
3801,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"The notes that breathe of peace,"
3802,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"That dry the anxious matron's tears,"
3803,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,And bid stern slaughter cease.
3804,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,There's joy when he treads the village green
3805,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,And views his father's cot;
3806,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,The horrors of the battle-scene
3807,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,Are in that hour forgot.
3808,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,
3809,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"There's joy in the shipwrecked seaman's heart,"
3810,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,Who has clung all night to the shrouds;
3811,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"When the morning breeze rives the rack apart,"
3812,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,And the sun breaks through the clouds.
3813,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"There's joy when he nears his native land,"
3814,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"And the tedious voyage is o'er,"
3815,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,And he feels the grasp of the kindred hand
3816,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,He thought to enfold no more.
3817,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,
3818,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"There's joy above, around, beneath,"
3819,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,But tis a fleeting ray;
3820,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"The world's stern strife, the hand of death,"
3821,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,Bid mortal hopes decay.
3822,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"But there's a better joy than earth,"
3823,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"With all her charms, can give,"
3824,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,"Which marks the Christian's second birth,"
3825,CHORUS OF SPIRITS.,When man but dies to live!

3836,LOVE.,The brightest mirror of the joys of heaven.
3837,LOVE.,"Child of Eternity's unclouded clime,"
3838,LOVE.,"Too fair for earth, too infinite for time:"
3839,LOVE.,"A seraph watching o'er Death's sullen shroud,"

3857,MORNING HYMN.,From the burning throne of light:
3858,MORNING HYMN.,"Where their glorious wings unfold,"
3859,MORNING HYMN.,There the east is streaked with gold;
3860,MORNING HYMN.,Gilding with celestial dyes
3861,MORNING HYMN.,The azure curtain of the skies.
3862,MORNING HYMN.,High in air their matin song

3924,EVENING HYMN.,And the blushing heavens awhile
3925,EVENING HYMN.,Long retain his parting smile.
3926,EVENING HYMN.,"Ere gray evening's sullen eye,"
3927,EVENING HYMN.,Bids those tints of beauty die;
3928,EVENING HYMN.,Ere her tears have washed away
3929,EVENING HYMN.,"The footsteps of departing day,"
3930,EVENING HYMN.,Nature from her verdant bowers
3931,EVENING HYMN.,Her last long strain of rapture pours;

3938,EVENING HYMN.,"Night resumes her ancient sway,"
3939,EVENING HYMN.,Round her sable tresses twining
3940,EVENING HYMN.,Countless hosts of stars are shining;
3941,EVENING HYMN.,Weaving round the brow of night
3942,EVENING HYMN.,A coronet of living light:
3943,EVENING HYMN.,"O'er the couch of nature bending,"
3944,EVENING HYMN.,"Their beauteous glances downward sending,"
3945,EVENING HYMN.,"A silent watch of glory keeping,"

3952,EVENING HYMN.,"Echo far, Jehovah reigns!"
3953,EVENING HYMN.,
3954,EVENING HYMN.,Creation sleeps--but many a sound
3955,EVENING HYMN.,Of melody is floating round--
3956,EVENING HYMN.,Where the moon-lit sea is flinging
3957,EVENING HYMN.,Its snowy foam and upward springing
3958,EVENING HYMN.,"To meet the shore advancing nigh,"
3959,EVENING HYMN.,"Pours, in many a broken sigh,"
3960,EVENING HYMN.,A mournful dirge o'er those who rest
3961,EVENING HYMN.,Forgotten in its stormy breast.
3962,EVENING HYMN.,"Restless ocean, onward rave;"
3963,EVENING HYMN.,"He who trod the boisterous wave,"
3964,EVENING HYMN.,"Shall to life those forms restore,"

3969,EVENING HYMN.,"Lord of all, Jehovah, reigns!"
3970,EVENING HYMN.,
3971,EVENING HYMN.,This is night;--her mantle gray
3972,EVENING HYMN.,She flings across the brow of day
3973,EVENING HYMN.,To hide from mortal ken awhile
3974,EVENING HYMN.,The splendour of his kingly smile.
3975,EVENING HYMN.,But what magic beauties lie
3976,EVENING HYMN.,"In her dark and shadowy eye,"
3977,EVENING HYMN.,When the moon with glory crowned
3978,EVENING HYMN.,Checkers o'er the distant ground;
3979,EVENING HYMN.,"Bathing now in floods of light,"
3980,EVENING HYMN.,"Now retreating from the sight,"
3981,EVENING HYMN.,As the heavy vapoury cloud
3982,EVENING HYMN.,Flings athwart its sable shroud;
3983,EVENING HYMN.,"Onward as her course is steering,"
3984,EVENING HYMN.,"Now through broken cliffs appearing,"
3985,EVENING HYMN.,She shows the brightness of her form
3986,EVENING HYMN.,And laughs exulting at the storm;
3987,EVENING HYMN.,Whilst misty hills and moon-lit plains
3988,EVENING HYMN.,"Echo far, Jehovah reigns!"
3989,EVENING HYMN.,
3990,EVENING HYMN.,"Night,--thy end is hastening fast,"
3991,EVENING HYMN.,Eternal day will dawn at last;

3994,EVENING HYMN.,And men redeemed from dust shall spring
3995,EVENING HYMN.,To hail the advent of their King;
3996,EVENING HYMN.,"Till heaven's wide arch repeats their strains,"
3997,EVENING HYMN.,"Christ, our own Immanuel, reigns!"
