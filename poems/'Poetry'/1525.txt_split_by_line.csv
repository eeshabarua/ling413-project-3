12,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,by William Shakespeare
13,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
14,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
15,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
16,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
17,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
18,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
19,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Let the bird of loudest lay,"
20,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"On the sole Arabian tree,"
21,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Herald sad and trumpet be,"
22,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,To whose sound chaste wings obey.
23,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
24,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"But thou shrieking harbinger,"
25,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Foul precurrer of the fiend,"
26,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Augur of the fever’s end,"
27,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,To this troop come thou not near.
28,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
29,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,From this session interdict
30,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Every fowl of tyrant wing,"
31,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Save the eagle, feather’d king;"
32,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Keep the obsequy so strict.
33,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
34,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Let the priest in surplice white,"
35,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"That defunctive music can,"
36,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Be the death-divining swan,"
37,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Lest the requiem lack his right.
38,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
39,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"And thou treble-dated crow,"
40,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,That thy sable gender mak’st
41,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"With the breath thou giv’st and tak’st,"
42,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,’Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.
43,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
44,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Here the anthem doth commence:
45,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Love and constancy is dead;
46,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Phoenix and the turtle fled
47,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,In a mutual flame from hence.
48,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
49,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"So they lov’d, as love in twain"
50,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Had the essence but in one;
51,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Two distincts, division none:"
52,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Number there in love was slain.
53,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
54,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Hearts remote, yet not asunder;"
55,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Distance and no space was seen
56,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,’Twixt this turtle and his queen;
57,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,But in them it were a wonder.
58,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
59,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"So between them love did shine,"
60,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,That the turtle saw his right
61,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Flaming in the phoenix’ sight;
62,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Either was the other’s mine.
63,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
64,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Property was thus appalled,"
65,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,That the self was not the same;
66,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Single nature’s double name
67,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Neither two nor one was called.
68,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
69,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Reason, in itself confounded,"
70,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Saw division grow together;
71,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"To themselves yet either neither,"
72,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Simple were so well compounded.
73,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
74,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"That it cried, How true a twain"
75,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Seemeth this concordant one!
76,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Love hath reason, reason none,"
77,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,If what parts can so remain.
78,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
79,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,Whereupon it made this threne
80,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"To the phoenix and the dove,"
81,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,"Co-supremes and stars of love,"
82,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,As chorus to their tragic scene.
83,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
84,THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE,
85,THRENOS,THRENOS
86,THRENOS,
87,THRENOS,"Beauty, truth, and rarity."
88,THRENOS,"Grace in all simplicity,"
89,THRENOS,Here enclos’d in cinders lie.
90,THRENOS,
91,THRENOS,Death is now the phoenix’ nest;
92,THRENOS,And the turtle’s loyal breast
93,THRENOS,To eternity doth rest.
94,THRENOS,
95,THRENOS,Leaving no posterity:—
96,THRENOS,"’Twas not their infirmity,"
97,THRENOS,It was married chastity.
98,THRENOS,
99,THRENOS,"Truth may seem, but cannot be;"
100,THRENOS,"Beauty brag, but ’tis not she;"
101,THRENOS,Truth and beauty buried be.
102,THRENOS,
103,THRENOS,To this urn let those repair
104,THRENOS,That are either true or fair;
105,THRENOS,For these dead birds sigh a prayer.
