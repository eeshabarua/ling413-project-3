8,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Before this book was printed, I thoughtlessly concluded there must be a preface; but, on consideration, see no particular purpose it would answer, and gladly decline a task I should have undertaken with much timidity and reluctance. All I feel necessary to premise, is, that the tale in the Old Shepherd's Recollections is founded on an event which happened in Ireland; and that last spring I suppressed the song ending in page 65 [The Old Man's Farewell], some time after it had been in the hands of the composer, from meeting accidentally with a quotation in a magazine that resembled it.

14,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'My bosom is chill'd with the cold, My limbs their lost vigour deplore! Alas! to the lonely and old, Hope warbles her promise no more! "
15,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Worn out with the length of my way, I must rest me awhile on the beach, To feel the salt dash of the spray, If haply so far it may reach. "
16,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'As the white-foaming billows arise, I reflect on the days that are past, When the pride of my strength could despise The keen-driving force of the blast. "
17,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Though the heavens might menace on high, I would still push my vessel from shore; At my calling undauntedly ply, And sing as I handled the oar. "
18,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'When fortune rewarded my toil, And my nets, deeply-laden, I drew, I hurried me home with the spoil, And its inmates rejoic'd at the view. "
19,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Though the winds and the waves were perverse, I was sure to be welcom'd with glee; My presence the cares would disperse, That were only awaken'd for me. "
20,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Whether weary, with toiling in vain, Or gay, from abundant success, I heard the same blessing again,-- I met the same tender caress: "
21,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'I fancied the perils repay'd, That could such affection ensure; By fondness and gratitude sway'd, I was eager to dare and endure. "
22,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'My cot did each comfort contain, And that gave my bosom delight; When drench'd by the winterly rain, I watch'd in my vessel at night. "
23,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'But, alas! from the tyrant, Disease, What love or what caution can save! A fever, more harsh than the seas, Consign'd my poor wife to the grave. "
24,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'My children, so tenderly rear'd, And pining for want of her care, Though more by my sorrows endear'd, Could not rescue my heart from despair. "
25,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'I tempted the dangers of night, And still labour'd hard at the oar, My sufferings appear'd to be light, But I suffer'd with pleasure no more. "
26,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'And yet, when some seasons had roll'd, I seem'd to awaken anew; My children I lov'd to behold, How tall and how comely they grew. "
27,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'My boy became hardy and bold, His spirit was buoyant and free; And, as I grew thoughtful and old, Was loud and oppressive to me. "
28,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'But the girl, like a bird in the bower, Awaken'd my hope and my pride; She won on my heart ev'ry hour, And I could not the preference hide. "
29,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'I mark'd the address and the care, The manner endearing and mild, Not dreaming those qualities rare Were to murther the peace of my child: "
30,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'That grandeur would ever descend To seek for so lowly a bride, Or his fair one, a lover pretend, From all she held dear to divide: "
31,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'That beauty was priz'd like a gem, Expected to dazzle and shine, Whose value the world would contemn, Unless trac'd to some Indian mine: "
32,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Alas! hapless girl! had I known Thou hadst learnt to repine at thy lot; That splendour and rank were thy own, Thy home and thy father forgot: "
33,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'That lore and ambition assail'd, Thou hadst left us, whatever befel! My pardon and prayers had prevail'd, I had blest thee, and bade thee farewel! "
34,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'With thy husband, from this happy clime, I had seen thee for ever depart! Still hoping affection and time Might soften the pride of his heart: "
35,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'That a moment perhaps would arise, When, fondling a child on the knee, He might read, in its innocent eyes A lesson of pity for me. "
36,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'But lips, which till then never said A word to cause any one pain, Inform'd me, when reason had fled, Of a conflict it could not sustain. "
37,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'And he, who had wish'd to conceal That the woman he lov'd had been poor, Began all his folly to feel, When the victim could hearken no more. "
38,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Yet still for himself did he mourn, And, indignant, I fled from the view: For my wrongs were not easily borne, And my anger was hard to subdue. "
39,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'One prop, one sole comfort, remain'd, Who saw me o'erladen with grief, Who saw (though I never complain'd) My heart was too sick for relief. "
40,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'One, who always attentive and dear, Every effort exerted to please, My desolate prospect to cheer, To study my health and my ease. "
41,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'For his was each toil and each care, The due observations to keep; To sit watching amid the night air, And fancy his father asleep. "
42,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Yet, dejected, and sadly forlorn, I dar'd in my heart to repine,-- To lament that I ever was born, Though such worth and affection were mine. "
43,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Alas! I was destin'd to know, However intense my despair, I still was reserv'd for a blow, More painful and cruel to bear. "
44,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Yes! this only one fell in the main! --I eagerly struggled to save; But I strove with the current in vain, And saw him sink under the wave! "
45,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'My head was astounded and wild,-- Incessant I roam'd on the shore, To seek the dead corse of my child, And to weep on his bosom once more. "
46,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Seven days undisturb'd was the sky, The eighth was a tempest most drear, I saw the huge billow rise high! I saw my lost treasure appear! "
47,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Like a dream it seem'd passing away:-- I hurried me onward to meet, And clasp the inanimate clay, When senseless I sunk at his feet. "
48,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'These hands, now enfeebled by time, The last pious offices paid! Age sorrow'd o'er youth in its prime, And my boy near his mother was laid. "
49,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Now scar'd by the griefs I have known, Wounds, apathy only can heal, My joys and my sorrows are flown, For I have forgotten to feel. "
50,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'But I know my Creator is just, That his hand will deliver me soon; I have learnt to submit and to trust, Though I finish my journey alone.' "

55,ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.,"Enchantress! whose transcendant pow'rs, With ease, the massy fabric raise;-- Beneath whose sway the tempest low'rs, Or lucid stream me√§nd'ring plays;-- "
56,ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.,"Accept the tribute of a heart, Which thou hast often made to glow With transport, oft with terror start, Or sink at strains of solemn woe! "
57,ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.,"Invention, like a falcon, tam'd By some expert and daring hand, For pride, for strength and fierceness fam'd, Implicit yields to thy command. Now mounts aloft in soaring flight, Shoots, like a star, beyond the sight; Or, in capricious windings borne, Mocks our faint hopes of safe return; Delights in trackless paths to roam, But hears thy call, and hurries home; Checks his bold wing when tow'ring free, And sails, without a pause, to thee! Enchantress, thy behests declare! And what thy strong delusions are! "
58,ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.,"When spirits in thy circle rise, Gaunt Wonder, panic-struck, and pale, Impatient Hope, and dread Surmise, Attendants on the mystic tale! "

60,ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.,"Say! do the nymphs of classic lore, So simply graceful, light, and fair, Forsake their consecrated shore, Their hallow'd groves, and purer air? "
61,ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.,"Tir'd of the ancient Grecian loom, And smit with Fancy's wayward glance, Weave they amid the Gothic gloom, The high-wrought fiction of Romance? "
62,ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.,"While the dark Genius of our northern clime, Whose giant limbs the mist of years enshrouds, Bursts through the veil which hides his head sublime, And moves majestic through recoiling clouds! "
63,ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.,"O yes! they own the wond'rous spell, And to each form their hands divine Give, with nice art, the temper'd swell, The chasten'd touch and faultless line! "
64,ON FIRST READING THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO.,"Each fiction under their command, Assumes an air severely true, And, every vision, wildly grand, Life's measur'd pace and modest hue. "

70,THE HEIR.,"Long kept in exile by paternal pride, He feels no joy beneath this splendid dome; For, till the elder child of promise died, He knew a dearer, though a humbler home. "
71,THE HEIR.,"Then the proud sail was spread! The youth obey'd, Left ev'ry friend, and every scene he knew; For ever left the soul-affianc'd maid, Though his heart sicken'd as he said--Adieu; And nurses still, with superstitious care, The sigh of fond remembrance and despair. "

As pilgrims, who, with zealous care, Some little treasur'd relic bear, To re-assure the doubtful mind, When pausing memory looks behind; I, from a more enlighten'd shrine, Had made this sweet memento mine: But, lo! its fainting head reclines; It folds the pallid leaf, and pines, As mourning the unhappy doom, Which tears it from so sweet a home!

78,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI.,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI. 
79,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI.,"Forlornly I wander, forlornly I sigh, And droop my head sadly, I cannot tell why: When the first breeze of morning blows fresh in my face, As the wild-waving walks of our woodlands I trace, Reviv'd for the moment I look all around, But my eyes soon grow languid, and fix on the ground. "
80,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI.,"I have yet no misfortune to rob me of rest, No love discomposes the peace of my breast; Ambition ne'er enter'd the verge of my thought, Nor by honours, by wealth, nor by power am I caught; Those phantoms of folly disturb not my ease, Yet Time is a tortoise, and Life a disease. "
81,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI.,"With the blessings of youth and of health on my side, A temper untainted by envy or pride; No guilt to corrode, and no foes to molest; There are many who tell me my station is blest. This I cannot dispute; yet without knowing why-- I feel that my bosom is big with a sigh. "
82,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI.,"Oh! why do I see that all knowledge is vain; That Science finds Error still keep in her train; That Imposture or Darkness, with Doubt and Surmise, Will mislead, will perplex, and then baffle the wise, Who often, when labours have shorten'd their span, Declare--not to know--is the province of man? "
83,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI.,"In life, as in learning, our views are confin'd, Our discernment too weak to discover the mind, Which, subdued and irresolute, keeps out of sight; Or if, for a moment, her presence delight, Our air is too gross for the stranger to stay; And, back to her prison she hurries away! "
84,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI.,"If my own narrow precincts I seek to explore, My wishes how vain, my attainments how poor! Tenacious of virtue, with caution I move; I correct, and I wrestle, but cannot approve; Till, bewilder'd and faint, I would yield up the rein, But I dare not in peace with my errors remain! "
85,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI.,"With zeal all awake in the cause of a friend, With warmth unrepress'd by my fear to offend, With sympathy active in hope or distress, How keen and how anxious I cannot express, I shrink, lest an eye should my feelings behold, And my heart seems insensible, selfish and cold. "
86,L'HOMME DE L'ENNUI.,"I strive to be gay, but my efforts are weak, And, sick of existence, for pleasure I seek; I mix with the empty, the loud, and the vain, Partake of their folly, and double my pain. In others I meet with depression and strife; Oh! where shall I seek for the music of life? "

91,THE GRANDFATHER'S DEPARTURE.,"And dearly did he love to take A rosy grandchild on his knee; To part his shining locks, and say, ""Just such another boy was he!"" "
92,THE GRANDFATHER'S DEPARTURE.,"And never felt he greater pride, And never did he look so gay, As when the little urchins strove To make him partner in their play. "
93,THE GRANDFATHER'S DEPARTURE.,"But when, in some more gentle mood, They silent hung upon his arm, Or nestled close at ev'ning pray'r, The old man felt a softer charm; "
94,THE GRANDFATHER'S DEPARTURE.,"And upward rais'd his closing eye, Whence slow effus'd a grateful tear, As if his senses own'd a joy, Too holy for endurance here. "
95,THE GRANDFATHER'S DEPARTURE.,"No heart e'er pray'd so fervently, Unprompted by an earthly zeal, None ever knew such tenderness, That did not true devotion feel. "

99,OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF FRIENDS.,OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF FRIENDS. 
100,OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF FRIENDS.,"My happiness was once a goodly tree, Which promis'd every day to grow more fair, And rear'd its lofty branches in the air, In sooth, it was a pleasant sight, to see! Amidst, fair honey-suckles crept along, Twin'd round the bark, and hung from every bough, While birds, which Fancy held by slender strings, Plum'd the dark azure of their shining wings, Or dipp'd them in the silver stream below, With many a joyful note, and many a song! "
101,OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF FRIENDS.,"When lo! a tempest hurtles in the sky! Dark low'r the clouds! the thunders burst around! Fiercely the arrowy flakes of lightning fly! While the scar'd songsters leave the quiv'ring bough, The blasted honey-suckles droop below, And many noble branches strew the ground! "
102,OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF FRIENDS.,"Though soon the air is calm, the sky serene, Though wide the broad and leafy arms are spread, Yet still the scars of recent wounds are seen; Their shelter henceforth seems but insecure; The winged tribes disdain the frequent lure, Where many a songster lies benumb'd or dead; And when I would the flow'ry tendrils train, I find my late delightful labour vain. "
103,OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF FRIENDS.,"Affection thus, once light of heart, and gay, Chasten'd by memory, and, unnerv'd by fear, Shall sadden each endearment with a tear, Sorrowing the offices of love shall pay, And scarcely dare to think that good her own, Which fate's imperious hand may snatch away, In the warm sunshine of meridian day, And when her hopes are full and fairest blown.

123,FRAGMENT.,FRAGMENT. 
124,FRAGMENT.,"A Pilgrim weary, toil-subdued, I reach'd a country, strange and rude, And trembled, lest approaching eve My hope of shelter might deceive; When I espied a hunter train, Prowling at leisure o'er the plain, And hasten'd on to ask relief, Of the ill-omen'd, haughty chief. His eye was artful, keen, and bold, His smile malevolently cold, And had not all my fire been fled, And every earthly passion dead, His pity to contempt allied, Had rous'd my anger and my pride; But, as it was, I bent my way, Where his secluded mansion lay, Which rose before my eyes at length, A fortress of determin'd strength, And layers of every colour'd moss The lofty turrets did emboss, As tho' the hand of father Time, Prepar'd a sacrifice sublime,-- Giving his daily rites away, To aggrandize some future day. Here as I roam'd the walk along, I heard a plaintive broken song; And ere I to the portal drew, An open window caught my view, Where a fair dame appear'd in sight, Array'd in robes of purest white. Large snowy folds confin'd her hair, And left a polish'd forehead bare. O'er her meek eyes, of deepest blue, The sable lash long shadows threw; Her cheek was delicately pale, And seem'd to tell a piteous tale, But o'er her looks such patience stole, Such saint-like tenderness of soul, That never did my eyes behold, A beauty of a lovelier mold. "
125,FRAGMENT.,"The Lady sigh'd, and closely prest A sleeping infant to her breast; Shook off sweet tears of love, and smil'd, Kissing the fingers of the child, Which round her own unconscious clung, Then fondly gaz'd, and softly sung: "
126,FRAGMENT.,"Once like that sea, which ebbs and flows, My bosom never knew repose, And heavily each morn arose. "
127,FRAGMENT.,"I bore with anger and disdain, I had no power to break my chain, No one to whom I dar'd complain. "
128,FRAGMENT.,"And when some bird has caught my eye, Or distant sail been flitting by, I wish'd I could as freely fly. "
129,FRAGMENT.,"But I can now contented be, Can tell, dear babe, my griefs to thee. And feel more brave, and breathe more free. "

137,FRAGMENT.,"I cannot thy affection draw, By childhood's first admiring awe; Be tender pity then thy law! "
138,FRAGMENT.,"This heart would bleed at every vein, I could not even life sustain, If ever thou should'st give me pain. "
139,FRAGMENT.,"O! soul of sweetness! can it be, That thou could'st prove unkind to me! That I should fear this blow from thee! "
140,FRAGMENT.,"Alas! e'en then I would not blame, My love to thee should be the same, And judge from whence unkindness came! "

259,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Low, heavy clouds are hanging on the hills, And half-impatient of the sun's approach, Shake sullenly their cold and languid wings! Oh! it is fine to see his morning beams Burst on the gloom, while, in disorder'd flight, The shuddering, mournful vapours steal away; Like the tenacious spirit of a man, Shrinking from the loud voice of cheerfulness, When it breaks in, so sadly out of tune, Upon his quiet musing, and dispels The waking dream of a dejected heart: The dream I cherish in this solitude, In all the wanderings of my little flock, That which beguiles my loneliness, and takes Its charm and change from the surrounding scene. "
260,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Oh! how unwelcome often are to me The gayest, most exhilarating sounds! When slow and sickly Memory, tempted forth By dint of soft persuasion, brings to light His treasures--and, with childish eagerness, Arranges and collects--then suddenly To have him startled by discordance, drag, Without discrimination, all away-- And with them leap to his deep hollow cave-- Not easily to be withdrawn again, Grieves one who loves to think of other times, To talk with those long silent in the grave, And pass from childhood to old age again. "
261,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Behold this stony rock! whose rifted crest, Lets the rough, roaring torrent force a way, And, foaming, pour its waters on the vale! Behold them tumbling from their dizzy height, Like clouds, of more than snowy whiteness, thrown Precipitate from heav'n, which, as they fall, Diffuse a mist, in form of glory, round! This was my darling haunt a long time past! Here, when a boy, in pleasing awe, I sate, Wistfully silent, with uplifted eye, And heart attun'd to the sad, lulling sound They made descending. Far below my feet, Near where yon little, ruin'd cottage lies, Oft, at the pensive hour of even-tide I saw young Osborne bearing on his harp, And, trusting to an aged mother's care, His darkling steps: Beneath that falling beech, Whose wide-spread branches touch the water's edge, He lov'd to sit, and feel the freshen'd gale Breathe cool upon him. "
262,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Then that falling beech Was a young, graceful tree; which, starting up, Amid the looser fragments of the rock, Rear'd boldly in the air its lofty head, While, struggling with the stone, the nervous roots Pursued their own direction, elbowing out, Their flinty neighbour; who, o'erspread with moss, Of varied hues, and deck'd with flow'ring heath, That from each fissure hung luxuriant down, Became a seat, where, king of all the scene, The harper sate, and, in sweet melodies, Now like the lark rejoicing at the dawn, Now soothing as the nightingale's sad note, Hail'd the departing sun, whose golden rays Glitter'd upon the surface of the wave, And, as a child upon its mother's arm Seeks to delay the coming hour of rest, Till sudden slumbers steal upon his smiles And veil him in a dream of love and joy, He seem'd reluctant to withdraw his beams; And, rich in roseate beauty, for awhile Kept the green waves beneath his glowing head. "
263,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Kind, gentle Osborne! half a century Has silver'd o'er the crisp and yellow locks Of thy young auditor, but memory still Grasps the torn record of my weary life. And finds full many a page to tell of thee! Oh! ye who have a friend ye truly love, One whom your hearts can trust, whose excellence Was not obtruded boastingly to view, But time and happy circumstance reveal'd, Rays of quick light upon a diamond Which else had lain unnotic'd in the waste! Oh! hasten! hasten speedily to pay Each debt of fond affection! lock not up So cautiously the tribute due to worth! Nor let reserve, as I have often done, Enslave the sweetest feelings of the soul! And hang around them like an envious mist, O'er the bright radiance of the morning star, Leaving us nothing but a spot of light Bereav'd of all its lustre! For my friend, He never knew that there was one on earth, After a parent felt the touch of death, And Love, a weeping pilgrim, turn'd away Far from his dwelling--Oh! he never knew, That there was one who would have follow'd him, With steady kindness, even to the grave! "
264,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Thou dear, neglected friend! to whom I owe All that sustains my heart, and makes me think The gift of life a blessing, Oh! forgive That in thy sorrows, my forgetful tongue Spake not of zeal and service; of the debt Which gratitude was emulous to pay! I might have trimm'd the dying lamp of hope, And cheer'd the bitter hours of banishment: But Oh! my youth was fearful, and I felt So deep an awe of that unspotted worth And saint-like gentleness--such a mistrust Of my own powers to tell him what I wish'd, That I resisted all my feelings claim'd, In anguish I resisted; but a spell Hung o'er me and compell'd me to be mute. "
265,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Methinks I still behold him! tall and fair, He had a look so tranquil and so mild, That something holy stole upon the sense When he appear'd; his language had such power In converse, that the hearer, as entranced Sate lingering on to listen; while in song, Or skill upon the many-stringed harp Was never heard his equal! Then he knew All our old ballads, all our father's tales, All the adventurous deeds of early times, The punishment of blood or sacrilege, And the reward of virtue, when it seem'd Deserted by the world, and left alone, A prey to scorn, oppression, contumely And all the ills which make the good despair. When-e'er we circled round him, one young girl Was always present, of a nicer ear, And more refin'd perception than the rest. Now she was lost in thought, while on her cheek Lay silent tears--and then that cheek grew pale In wild amazement--but, when he began To speak of noble deeds, she rais'd her head, Bending with looks of mingled awe and love, And zealous admiration, on the youth, Alone insensible of all around, To the soft charm of symmetry and grace, The smile intelligent, the look benign, And all the outward raiment of the soul. Yet, though he saw her not, it was his fate To have an inward and discerning sense, Which spake of Lora's gentleness and worth. He lov'd in her the fondness of his art, And taught her many wild and simple airs, Suiting the plaintive tenor of her voice, Which he would mimic with sweet minstrelsy. When she was absent, and with strange delight, Repeat her parting words, her kind adieu, Or sweetly-spoken promise of return. "
266,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"And that return was prompt: she linger'd oft Till evening wet the ground with heavy dew, Or came to take her lesson in the morn, Before her father's anxious eyes unclos'd, To look upon her beauty with delight, And soothe the rugged temper of his soul, By views of future grandeur for his child: Not thinking that her elegance of mind, The modest dignity of humble worth Which fits the low-born peasant to become A crowned monarch, and to wield with grace The golden sceptre, had instructed her To feel no paltry jealousy of power, No bold aspiring, and no wish beyond The bounded confines of her present state: Had counsell'd her, that even mines of wealth, Could purchase nothing to content the wise, Esteem or friendship, tenderness or love: That power at best was but a heavy weight; If well employ'd, a dubious, unpaid toil, If ill, a curse, to tempt men to their fate. "
267,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Her cheek had often felt the blush of shame, At his proud boasting; and her heart had sunk At the cold arrogance that scorn'd the poor; But she was fain to turn aside, and weep, To wring her hands in secret, and to raise The eye of silent anguish up to heaven; For though he dearly lov'd her, he would ne'er Submit to hear a murmur at his will. Oft with her heart oppress'd, and her blue eyes Full of unshedden tears, she bent her way Alone to Osborne's lowly cot, and when Her faint voice call'd the fond inquiry forth, Would say, ""'tis true, my friends, that I am sad, Nay sick, with vain repining. O! I wish, That I were either indigent myself, Or that I had the power, the blessed power Of cheering the unhappy! for I want, By kindness to prevent the act of guilt, And ward the arrows of incroaching Death, Who comes, before the time, upon his prey. Think that there should be means to stay his wrath, To purchase health, life, comfort, innocence, And yet those means withholden! "
268,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"""O! my heart! It dies with sorrow! and where most I love, Sheds all its bitterness; delighting still To tell the many miseries that flit At times across me! Those I lightly prize Partake the sunshine of my happier hours, Although I seek them with far less delight! The loud laugh dwells not here, the sportive dance, The carol of unconscious levity, And yet how oft, how willingly I come!"" "
269,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"""Know'st thou not, Lora,"" cried the youthful sage, ""That there are things the mind must prize above What captivates the senses! That in them She feels no interest, and she takes no care! That though sometimes an alien, she receives Delighted back the ensigns of her power, And takes her truant vassals into grace! That when thou bring'st to us that wounded mind, The grave of many feelings, language is As yet too poor to utter, thou canst give No richer, dearer token of regard."" "
270,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"""Were man indeed the only hope of man, I never would reprove thee for thy tears! But, they are vain! man has a surer trust! The helpless, weary, miserable wretch, Left by his fellows in the wilderness, Shall be supported in that trying hour, By a right arm, which, in his days of strength, He did not lean upon! A gracious arm, Which wounds the sick, and heals them by the stroke. O! Lora! to the Father of the world, A Judge so patient and so merciful. That he refuses not the latest sigh. Nor suffers sorrow but as means to save, Canst thou not trust the objects of thy care! "
271,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"""Hadst thou the power to help them--it were well, To be most anxious. To collect thy freight Of human sorrow, and, by merchandize, Exchange it for the riches of the world: For health, for comfort, nay, perchance for life, That gem of countless value, which sometimes, Not all the treasures of the East can buy, Tendered with supplications and with tears, Is often purchas'd at a petty price, Nay, in exchange for courtesy. What joy Must in that moment fill the merchant's heart, To win a jewel, kings monopolize The sole disposal of! Be patient then! This glorious privilege may yet be thine! Deserve it only by fulfilling all The gentler duties that have present claims With cheerfulness and zeal--Let no neglect Press on thy father's age, no discontent Sour thee with thy companions, no mistrust Give pain to friendship, and thy usefulness Though calm and bounded, has no mean award."" "
272,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Thus, like a prophet, did he still enforce Only the virtues and rare qualities Congenial with her after destiny; Yet, not foreseeing evil, he himself Was unprepared, and when her father led, Her opposition and entreaty past, The hapless Lora forth, to promise love And honour to a man, whose vacant mind, Throughout a course of long succeeding years, She vainly strove to soften and to raise, Though he had taught her patience till that hour, His own at once forsook him, and he fled. "
273,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"She murmur'd not, nor even seem'd to mourn, But losing all her love of solitude, Appear'd so active in each new pursuit, So wholly what her anxious father wish'd, That he repented not his cruelty. Believing in her happiness, he felt Himself the author, and became more proud Of his own wisdom: yet she often heard His wayward taunt or querulous complaint, And, from the lordly partner of her fate, The harsher sound of ignorant rebuke. She was a matchless woman, when she lost The timid graces of retiring youth, She still was lovely, for her shaded eyes Beam'd with a lofty sweetness, a content Beyond the pow'r of fortune to destroy. Careless of let or hindrance, she went on, Nor shrunk nor started at the many thorns Strew'd in her toilsome path; still looking forth To others' weal, forgetful it would seem, Perchance in heart despairing of her own. The friend, the help, the comforter of all, No voice was heard so cheerful, nor a step So bounding and so light. 'Twas wonderful! For I have seen her, when her polish'd arm Has clasp'd the nurseling, with her face conceal'd Bent fondly o'er; and I have mark'd each limb To boast a fine expansion, as if thrill'd With the deep feelings of maternal love And aching tenderness, too highly wrought For happy souls to cherish! they delight In painless joys, and, on the infant's cheek, Rounded and glowing with a finer bloom Than the wild-rose, careless imprint the kiss, Which sorrow always sanctions by a prayer. They in the radiance of its glancing eyes See nothing to suffuse with their own tears! Borne forward on the easy wing of Time, They travel on, they scarcely meet with Thought, Or, like a summer cloud, he passes by, His shadow rests one instant, and again The scene is calm and brilliant as before! "
274,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Not so with Lora, trouble, sickness, death, Were busy with the residue of peace, When years and care had weaken'd her regrets, Veil'd the sad recollection of past days, And overgrown the softness of her mind, As the close-creeping ivy hides and rusts The smooth and silver surface of the beech. An orphan and a widow--she became Decisive, watchful, prudent, nay severe To wilful disobedience or neglect; Though generous where she perceiv'd desert. She taught her children with unceasing zeal, Sought knowledge for their sakes, and, more than all, Anxious, inquisitive about the heart, Search'd all the motives, all the incidents In which it was unfolded; fencing still Each treacherous failing with a double guard, And oft repeated warnings; well conceal'd, Or given with so much kindness, that they serv'd To draw more closely every knot of love. Nor did she cease to urge her pious cares By constant vigilance, till riper age Had fix'd the moral sense, when, as a bow For a long active season tightly strain'd Relaxes, tumult and contention o'er, She sunk into indulgence, glad to yield To mildness, nature, and herself again. "
275,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"Youth, e'en when wise and good, requires a change, Delights in novelty, and hears of nought Which suddenly it asks not to behold; And Lora's children oft assail'd her ear To let them journey to some rumour'd scene, Some feast, or village wake, or sprightly dance, Urging her still to bear them company. She lov'd to give them pleasure, and one time (The fav'rite legend of our country folk Hath oft the tale repeated) as they mix'd Carelessly in the crowd, remember'd notes Struck by a harper in a distant tent, Sweet and soul-piercing as the midnight songs Which are, they say, the harbingers of death, Flow'd on her ear--when, with impulsive spring, As if a magic spell had wing'd her feet, Fearing the sounds would vanish into air, And prove delusion ere she reach'd the spot, She forward rush'd, and soon beheld the friend, The dear companion of her youth. She seiz'd The hand that lay upon the quivering chords, Stopping their melody and resting mute. The pause was awful--He at length exclaim'd, In a deep, laboured cry, ""Ye heavenly powers! If Lora lives, the hand I feel is hers!"" She could not speak, but with her other hand Clasp'd his, and sigh'd and rais'd her eyes to heaven, When straight the big, round tears began to flow; ""And is it thee, dear Lora! Art thou come Again to gladden one, who never found 'Mid countless who are good, a heart like thine! Oh! speak! that I may know if still my ear Retains a true remembrance of that voice! For since, it has not drank so sweet a sound."" "
276,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"""Hail happy day!"" cried Lora, ""which restores The friend whose absence I have mourn'd so long! For thou, O! Osborne! must with me return, Me and my children! They shall hear again Those counsels which inform'd their mother's heart; Gave courage in the hour of enterprize, Calmness in danger, patience under ills That like a swarm of insects buz around, And vex the spirit which they cannot rouse. Return, my early, long-lost friend! with us Thou shalt enjoy repose: our cheerful home Shall gather round thee many an honest heart Which knows thy virtues, and will hold thee dear."" "
277,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"She paus'd, and Osborne joyful gave assent. Fair hopes of joy engaged his faultering mind, For long-time had he dragg'd a weary life, Lone, or bereav'd of relative or friend, Careful to tend his health, and to divert His sadness; each succeeding hour had press'd With its slow-passing wing his gentle head Drooping and prematurely silver'd o'er, (Like snows depending on the autumn leaf) Yet warm, benevolent, serene, resign'd, And like an angel save in youth and joy. "
278,THE OLD SHEPHERD'S RECOLLECTIONS.,"A winding path round yonder wooded hill, Leads to a spot where Nature decks herself In loveliness and beauty: far below Spreads the green valley, where a silent stream Turns, like a serpent writhing in its course; And, rarified by distance, kissing heaven, In many noble and fantastic shapes, A giant range of purple mountains sleeps. Grand is the scene, and in the centre stands The tomb of Osborne--after many years Of happiness and friendship, Lora rais'd This plain memorial, and her children plac'd A mother's near, to tell succeeding years Their talents and their virtue. They themselves More forcibly express the worth of both, For they are wise and good, without a shade Of cold severity or selfish pride. "

296,THE DAUGHTER.,"""He will not know my pain and my despair, When that dread scene arises on my view, Where my poor father would not hear my pray'r, Or grant his only child a last adieu! "
297,THE DAUGHTER.,"""He will not know that still the hour I mourn, When death all hopes of pardon snatch'd away; That still this heart by sad remembrance torn, Repeats the dreadful mandate of that day. "
298,THE DAUGHTER.,"""Luckless for him has been my constant love, Luckless the destiny I bade him brave, For since a parent did our vows reprove, Sorrow was all the gift my fondness gave. "
299,THE DAUGHTER.,"""Then, though I knew my father's stern command, The short-liv'd conflict of affection o'er, I offer'd to the youth my dowerless hand, And fondly reason'd thus on being poor, "
300,THE DAUGHTER.,"""'Can pomp or splendour elevate the soul, Brighten the lustre that illumes the eye! Make the rough stream of life more smoothly roll, Suppress the tear, or waft away the sigh! "
301,THE DAUGHTER.,"""'Can happiness a purer joy receive, In the proud mansions of the rich and great? Or, tell me, can the wounded bosom heave With blunted anguish under robes of state! "
