93,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,
94,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,
95,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,There is no length of days
96,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"But yours, boys who were children once.  Of old"
97,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"The past beset you in your childish ways,"
98,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,With sense of Time untold!
99,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,
100,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,What have you then forgone?
101,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,A history?  This you had.  Or memories?
102,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"These, too, you had of your far-distant dawn."
103,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"No further dawn seems his,"
104,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,
105,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"The old man who shares with you,"
106,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"But has no more, no more.  Time's mystery"
107,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,Did once for him the most that it can do:
108,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,He has had infancy.
109,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,
110,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"And all his dreams, and all"
111,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"His loves for mighty Nature, sweet and few,"
112,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,Are but the dwindling past he can recall
113,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,Of what his childhood knew.
114,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,
115,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,He counts not any more
116,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"His brief, his present years.  But O he knows"
117,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"How far apart the summers were of yore,"
118,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,How far apart the snows.
119,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,
120,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,Therefore be satisfied;
121,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,Long life is in your treasury ere you fall;
122,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,"Yes, and first love, like Dante's.  O a bride"
123,TO THE EARLY DEAD IN BATTLE,For ever mystical!
