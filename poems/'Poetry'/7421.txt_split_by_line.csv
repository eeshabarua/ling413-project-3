279,THE MEN-MADE GODS,Said the Kaiser’s god to the god of the Czar:
280,THE MEN-MADE GODS,"‘Hark, hark, how my people pray."
281,THE MEN-MADE GODS,"Their faith, methinks, is greater by far"
282,THE MEN-MADE GODS,Than all the faiths of the others are;
283,THE MEN-MADE GODS,They know I will help them slay.’
284,THE MEN-MADE GODS,
285,THE MEN-MADE GODS,Said the god of the Czar: ‘My people call
286,THE MEN-MADE GODS,In a medley of tongues; they know
287,THE MEN-MADE GODS,I will lend my strength to them one and all.
288,THE MEN-MADE GODS,Wherever they fight their foes shall fall
289,THE MEN-MADE GODS,Like grass where the mowers go.’
290,THE MEN-MADE GODS,
291,THE MEN-MADE GODS,Then the god of the Gauls spoke out of a cloud
292,THE MEN-MADE GODS,To the god of the King nearby:
293,THE MEN-MADE GODS,"‘Our people pray, tho’ they pray not loud;"
294,THE MEN-MADE GODS,"They ask for courage to slaughter a crowd,"
295,THE MEN-MADE GODS,"And to laugh, tho’ themselves may die.’"
296,THE MEN-MADE GODS,
297,THE MEN-MADE GODS,And far out into the heart of Space
298,THE MEN-MADE GODS,"Where a lonely pathway crept,"
299,THE MEN-MADE GODS,"Up over the stars, to a secret place,"
300,THE MEN-MADE GODS,"Where no light shone but the light of His face,"

307,THE GHOSTS,
308,THE GHOSTS,"There was no wind, and yet the air"
309,THE GHOSTS,Seemed suddenly astir;
310,THE GHOSTS,"There were no forms, and yet all space"
311,THE GHOSTS,Seemed thronged with growing hosts.
312,THE GHOSTS,"They came from Where, and from Nowhere,"
313,THE GHOSTS,Like phantoms as they were;
314,THE GHOSTS,They came from many a land and place—
315,THE GHOSTS,"The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts."
316,THE GHOSTS,
317,THE GHOSTS,"And some were white, and some were grey,"
318,THE GHOSTS,And some were red as blood—
319,THE GHOSTS,Those ghosts of men who met their death
320,THE GHOSTS,Upon the field of war.
321,THE GHOSTS,"Against the skies of fading day,"
322,THE GHOSTS,Like banks of cloud they stood;
323,THE GHOSTS,"And each wraith asked another wraith,"
324,THE GHOSTS,‘What were we fighting for?’
325,THE GHOSTS,
326,THE GHOSTS,"One said, ‘I was my mother’s all;"
327,THE GHOSTS,And she was old and blind.’
328,THE GHOSTS,"Another, ‘Back on earth, my wife"
329,THE GHOSTS,And week-old baby lie.’
330,THE GHOSTS,"Another, ‘At the bugle’s call,"
331,THE GHOSTS,I left my bride behind;
332,THE GHOSTS,Love made so beautiful my life
333,THE GHOSTS,I could not bear to die.’
334,THE GHOSTS,
335,THE GHOSTS,In voices like the winds that moan
336,THE GHOSTS,"Among pine trees at night,"
337,THE GHOSTS,"They whispered long, the newly dead,"
338,THE GHOSTS,While listening stars came out.
339,THE GHOSTS,"‘We wonder if the cause is known,"
340,THE GHOSTS,"And if the war was right,"
341,THE GHOSTS,"That killed us in our prime,’ they said,"
342,THE GHOSTS,‘And what it was about.’
343,THE GHOSTS,
344,THE GHOSTS,They came in throngs that filled all space—
345,THE GHOSTS,Those whispering phantom hosts;

347,THE GHOSTS,"The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts."

834,HE,One decade and a half since first we came
835,HE,With hearts aflame
836,HE,"Into Love’s Paradise, as man and mate;"
837,HE,And now we separate.
838,HE,"Soon, all too soon,"
839,HE,Waned the white splendour of our honeymoon.
840,HE,We saw it fading; but we did not know
841,HE,How bleak the path would be when once its glow
842,HE,Was wholly gone.
843,HE,And yet we two were forced to follow on—
844,HE,"Leagues, leagues apart while ever side by side."
845,HE,"Darker and darker grew the loveless weather,"
846,HE,"Darker the way,"
847,HE,Until we could not stay
848,HE,Longer together.
849,HE,"Now that all anger from our hearts has died,"
850,HE,"And love has flown far from its ruined nest,"
851,HE,"To find sweet shelter in another breast,"
852,HE,"Let us talk calmly of our past mistakes,"
853,HE,And of our faults; if only for the sakes
854,HE,Of those with whom our futures will be cast.
855,HE,You shall speak first.
856,HE,
857,HE,
858,SHE,SHE
859,SHE,
860,SHE,
861,SHE,A woman would speak last—
862,SHE,Tell me my first grave error as a wife.
863,SHE,
864,SHE,
865,HE,HE
866,HE,
867,HE,
868,HE,Inertia.  My young veins were rife
869,HE,With manhood’s ardent blood; and love was fire
870,HE,Within me.  But you met my strong desire
871,HE,"With lips like frozen rose leaves—chaste, so chaste"
872,HE,That all your splendid beauty seemed but waste
873,HE,Of love’s materials.  Then of that beauty
874,HE,Which had so pleased my sight
875,HE,You seemed to take no care; you felt no duty
876,HE,To keep yourself an object of delight
877,HE,For lover’s-eyes; and appetite
878,HE,And indolence soon wrought
879,HE,Their devastating changes.  You were not
880,HE,The woman I had sworn to love and cherish.
881,HE,"If love is starved, what can love do but perish?"
882,HE,Now will you speak of my first fatal sin
883,HE,"And all that followed, even as I have done?"
884,HE,
885,HE,
886,SHE,SHE
887,SHE,
888,SHE,
889,SHE,I must begin
890,SHE,With the young quarter of our honeymoon.
891,SHE,You are but one
892,SHE,Of countless men who take the priceless boon
893,SHE,"Of woman’s love and kill it at the start,"
894,SHE,Not wantonly but blindly.  Woman’s passion
895,SHE,"Is such a subtle thing—woof of her heart,"
896,SHE,Web of her spirit; and the body’s part
897,SHE,Is to play ever but the lesser rôle
898,SHE,To her white soul.
899,SHE,"Seized in brute fashion,"
900,SHE,It fades like down on wings of butterflies;
901,SHE,Then dies.
902,SHE,So my love died.
903,SHE,"Next, on base Mammon’s cross you nailed my pride,"
904,SHE,Making me ask for what was mine by right:
905,SHE,"Until, in my own sight,"
906,SHE,I seemed a helpless slave
907,SHE,To whom the master gave
908,SHE,"A grudging dole.  Oh, yes, at times gifts showered"
909,SHE,Upon your chattel; but I was not dowered
910,SHE,By generous love.  Hate never framed a curse
911,SHE,Or placed a cruel ban
912,SHE,"That so crushed woman, as the law of man"
913,SHE,That makes her pensioner upon his purse.
914,SHE,That necessary stuff called gold is such
915,SHE,"A cold, rude thing it needs the nicest touch"
916,SHE,"Of thought and speech when it approaches love,"
917,SHE,Or it will prove the certain death thereof.
918,SHE,
919,SHE,
920,HE,HE
921,HE,
922,HE,
923,HE,Your words cut deep; ’tis time we separate.

1244,PROTEST,To sit in silence when we should protest

1247,PROTEST,"Against injustice, ignorance and lust"
1248,PROTEST,The Inquisition yet would serve the law
1249,PROTEST,And guillotines decide our least disputes.
1250,PROTEST,The few who dare must speak and speak again
1251,PROTEST,"To right the wrongs of many.  Speech, thank God,"
1252,PROTEST,No vested power in this great day and land
1253,PROTEST,Can gag or throttle; Press and voice may cry
1254,PROTEST,"Loud disapproval of existing ills,"
1255,PROTEST,May criticise oppression and condemn
1256,PROTEST,The lawlessness of wealth-protecting laws
1257,PROTEST,That let the children and child-bearers toil
1258,PROTEST,"To purchase ease for idle millionaires,"
1259,PROTEST,Therefore do I protest against the boast
1260,PROTEST,Of independence in this mighty land.
1261,PROTEST,"Call no chain strong which holds one rusted link,"
1262,PROTEST,Call no land free that holds one fettered slave

1266,PROTEST,The precious one beneath her heart; until

1331,THE STATUE,
1332,THE STATUE,
1333,THE STATUE,A granite rock in the mountain side
1334,THE STATUE,Gazed on the world and was satisfied.
1335,THE STATUE,"It watched the centuries come and go,"
1336,THE STATUE,"It welcomed the sunlight yet loved the snow,"
1337,THE STATUE,"It grieved when the forest was forced to fall,"
1338,THE STATUE,Yet joyed when steeples rose white and tall
1339,THE STATUE,"In the valley below it, and thrilled to hear"
1340,THE STATUE,The voice of the great town roaring near.
1341,THE STATUE,
1342,THE STATUE,When the mountain stream from its idle play
1343,THE STATUE,Was caught by the mill-wheel and borne away
1344,THE STATUE,"And trained to labour, the gray rock mused,"
1345,THE STATUE,‘Tree and verdure and stream are used
1346,THE STATUE,"By man the master, but I remain"
1347,THE STATUE,"Friend of the mountain and star and plain,"
1348,THE STATUE,Unchanged forever by God’s decree
1349,THE STATUE,While passing centuries bow to me.’
1350,THE STATUE,
1351,THE STATUE,"Then all unwarned, with a mighty shock"
1352,THE STATUE,Out of the mountain was wrenched the rock;
1353,THE STATUE,"Bruised and battered, and broken in heart"
1354,THE STATUE,It was carried away to the common mart.
1355,THE STATUE,"Wrenched, and ruined in peace and pride,"
1356,THE STATUE,"‘Oh, God is cruel,’ the granite cried,"
1357,THE STATUE,"‘Comrade of mountain, of star the friend,"
1358,THE STATUE,By all deserted—how sad my end.’
1359,THE STATUE,
1360,THE STATUE,A dreaming sculptor in passing by
1361,THE STATUE,Gazed on the granite with thoughtful eye;
1362,THE STATUE,Then stirred with a purpose supremely grand
1363,THE STATUE,He bade his dream in the rock expand.
1364,THE STATUE,And lo! from the broken and shapeless mass
1365,THE STATUE,"That grieved and doubted, it came to pass"
1366,THE STATUE,That a glorious statue of priceless worth
1367,THE STATUE,And infinite beauty adorned the earth.

1407,WHAT THEY SAW,"The awful alms-house, where the living dead rot slowly in their"

1409,WHAT THEY SAW,And there were shameful things;
1410,WHAT THEY SAW,"Soldiers and forts, and industries of death, and devil ships, and"

1453,HIS LAST LETTER,
1454,HIS LAST LETTER,"Well, you are free;"
1455,HIS LAST LETTER,"The longed for, lied for, waited for decree"
1456,HIS LAST LETTER,Is yours to-day.
1457,HIS LAST LETTER,"I made no protest; and you had your say,"
1458,HIS LAST LETTER,And left me with no vestige of repute.
1459,HIS LAST LETTER,"Neglect, abuse, and cruelty you charge"
1460,HIS LAST LETTER,With broken marriage vows.  The list is large
1461,HIS LAST LETTER,But not to be denied.  So I was mute.
1462,HIS LAST LETTER,
1463,HIS LAST LETTER,Now you shall listen to a few plain facts
1464,HIS LAST LETTER,Before you go out wholly from my life
1465,HIS LAST LETTER,As some man’s wife.
1466,HIS LAST LETTER,Read carefully this statement of your acts
1467,HIS LAST LETTER,Which changed the lustre of my honeymoon
1468,HIS LAST LETTER,"To sombre gloom,"
1469,HIS LAST LETTER,And wrenched the cover from Pandora’s box.
1470,HIS LAST LETTER,
1471,HIS LAST LETTER,In those first talks
1472,HIS LAST LETTER,"’Twixt bride and groom I showed you my whole heart,"
1473,HIS LAST LETTER,Showed you how deep my love was and how true;
1474,HIS LAST LETTER,With all a strong man’s feeling I loved YOU:
1475,HIS LAST LETTER,"(God, how I loved you, my one chosen mate.)"
1476,HIS LAST LETTER,But I learned this
1477,HIS LAST LETTER,(So poorly did you play your little part):
1478,HIS LAST LETTER,"You married marriage, to avoid the fate"
1479,HIS LAST LETTER,Of having ‘Miss’
1480,HIS LAST LETTER,"Carved on your tombstone.  Love you did not know,"
1481,HIS LAST LETTER,But you were greedy for the showy things
1482,HIS LAST LETTER,That money brings.
1483,HIS LAST LETTER,Such weak affection as you could bestow
1484,HIS LAST LETTER,"Was given the provider, not the lover."
1485,HIS LAST LETTER,
1486,HIS LAST LETTER,The knowledge hurt.  Keen pain like that is dumb;
1487,HIS LAST LETTER,"And masks itself in smiles, lest men discover."
1488,HIS LAST LETTER,But I was lonely; and the feeling grew
1489,HIS LAST LETTER,The more I studied you.
1490,HIS LAST LETTER,"Into your shallow heart love could not come,"
1491,HIS LAST LETTER,But yet you loved my love; because it gave
1492,HIS LAST LETTER,The prowess of a mistress o’er a slave.
1493,HIS LAST LETTER,You showed your power
1494,HIS LAST LETTER,"In petty tyranny hour after hour,"
1495,HIS LAST LETTER,"Day after day, year after lengthening years."
1496,HIS LAST LETTER,"My tasks, my pleasures, my pursuits were not"
1497,HIS LAST LETTER,"Held near or dear,"
1498,HIS LAST LETTER,Or made to seem important in your thought.
1499,HIS LAST LETTER,My friends were not your friends; you goaded me
1500,HIS LAST LETTER,"By foolish and ignoble jealousy,"
1501,HIS LAST LETTER,"Till, through suggestion’s laws"
1502,HIS LAST LETTER,I gave you cause.
1503,HIS LAST LETTER,The beauteous ideal Love had hung
1504,HIS LAST LETTER,"In my soul’s shrine,"
1505,HIS LAST LETTER,"And worshipped as a something all divine,"
1506,HIS LAST LETTER,With wanton hand you flung
1507,HIS LAST LETTER,Into the dust.  And then you wondered why
1508,HIS LAST LETTER,My love should die.
1509,HIS LAST LETTER,My sins and derelictions cry aloud
1510,HIS LAST LETTER,To all the world: my head is bowed
1511,HIS LAST LETTER,Under its merited reproaches.  Yours
1512,HIS LAST LETTER,Is lifted to receive
1513,HIS LAST LETTER,The sympathy the court’s decree insures.
1514,HIS LAST LETTER,The world loves to believe
1515,HIS LAST LETTER,In man’s depravity and woman’s worth;
1516,HIS LAST LETTER,But I am one of many men on earth
1517,HIS LAST LETTER,Whose loud resounding fall
1518,HIS LAST LETTER,Is like the crashing of some well-built wall
1519,HIS LAST LETTER,Which those who seek can trace
1520,HIS LAST LETTER,To the slow work of insects at its base.
1521,HIS LAST LETTER,. . . . . . .

1642,A WISH,It cannot ever be flowing;
1643,A WISH,The high-water mark in the night and the dark—
1644,A WISH,"Then dawn, and the outward going."
1645,A WISH,
1646,A WISH,But the people who pull at my heart-strings hard
1647,A WISH,Are the ones whom destiny hurries
1648,A WISH,"Through commonplace ways to the end of their days,"
1649,A WISH,And pesters with paltry worries.
1650,A WISH,The peddlers who trudge with a budget of wares
1651,A WISH,To the door that is slammed unkindly;
1652,A WISH,The vendor who stands with his shop in his hands
1653,A WISH,Where the hastening hosts pass blindly;
1654,A WISH,
1655,A WISH,The woman who holds in her poor flat purse
1656,A WISH,"The price of her rent-room only,"
1657,A WISH,While her starved eye feeds on the comfort she needs
1658,A WISH,To brighten the lot that is lonely;
1659,A WISH,"The man in the desert of endless work,"
1660,A WISH,Unsoftened by islands of leisure;
1661,A WISH,"And the children who toil in the dust and the soil,"
1662,A WISH,While their little hearts cry for pleasure;
1663,A WISH,
1664,A WISH,"The people who labour, and scrimp, and save,"
1665,A WISH,"At the call of some thankless duty,"
1666,A WISH,"And carefully hide, with a mien of pride,"
1667,A WISH,Their ravening hunger for beauty;
1668,A WISH,"These ask no pity, and seek no aid,"

2100,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,There was once a little comet who lived near the Milky Way!
2101,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,She loved to wander out at night and jump about and play.
2102,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,The mother of the comet was a very good old star—
2103,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,She used to scold her reckless child for venturing out too far;
2104,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"She told her of the ogre, Sun, who loved on stars to sup,"
2105,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,And who asked no better pastimes than gobbling comets up.
2106,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,
2107,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"But instead of growing cautious and of showing proper fear,"
2108,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"The foolish little comet edged up near, and near, and near."
2109,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"She switched her saucy tail along right where the Sun could see,"
2110,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,And flirted with old Mars and was bold as bold could be.
2111,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"She laughed to scorn the quiet stars, who never frisked about;"
2112,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,She said there was no fun in life unless you ventured out.
2113,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,
2114,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"She liked to make the planets stare, and wished no better mirth"
2115,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,Than just to see the telescopes aimed at her from the Earth.
2116,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"She wondered how so many stars could mope through nights and days,"
2117,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,And let the sickly faced old moon get all the love and praise.
2118,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"And as she talked and tossed her head and switched her shining trail,"
2119,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"The staid old mother star grew sad, her cheek grew wan and pale."
2120,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,
2121,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"For she had lived there in the skies a million years or more,"
2122,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,And she had heard gay comets talk in just this way before.
2123,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,And by and by there came an end to this gay comet’s fun—
2124,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,She went a tiny bit too far—and vanished in the Sun!
2125,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,"No more she swings her shining trail before the whole world’s sight,"
2126,A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET,But quiet stars she laughed to scorn are twinkling every night.

2273,MY FAITH,A beauteous heaven; a heaven of thought all clarified
2274,MY FAITH,Of hate and fear and doubt; a heaven of rarefied

2519,A VISION,A VISION
2520,A VISION,
2521,A VISION,
2522,A VISION,My soul beheld a vision of the Master:
2523,A VISION,"Methought He stood with grieved and questioning eyes,"
2524,A VISION,Where Freedom drove its chariot to disaster
2525,A VISION,"And toilers heard, unheeding, toilers’ cries."
2526,A VISION,"Where man withheld God’s bounties from his neighbour,"
2527,A VISION,And fertile fields were sterilised by greed;
2528,A VISION,"Where Labour’s hand was lifted against labour,"
2529,A VISION,And suffering serfs to despots turned when freed.
2530,A VISION,
2531,A VISION,Majestic rose tall steeple after steeple;
2532,A VISION,Imperious bells called worshippers to prayer;
2533,A VISION,"But as they passed, the faces of the people"
2534,A VISION,"Were marred by envy, anger and despair."
2535,A VISION,"‘Christ the Redeemer of the world has risen,"
2536,A VISION,"Peace and good will,’ so rang the major strain;"
2537,A VISION,"But forth from sweat-shops, tenement and prison"
2538,A VISION,"Wailed minor protests, redolent with pain."
2539,A VISION,
2540,A VISION,"Methought about the Master, all unseeing,"
2541,A VISION,"Fought desperate hosts of striking clan with clan,"
2542,A VISION,"Their primal purpose, meant for labour’s freeing,"
2543,A VISION,Sunk in vindictive hate of man for man.
2544,A VISION,"Pretentious Wealth, in unearned robes of beauty,"
2545,A VISION,"Flung Want a pittance from her bulging purse,"
2546,A VISION,"While ill-paid Toil went on dull rounds of duty,"
2547,A VISION,"Hell in her heart, and on her lips a curse."
2548,A VISION,
2549,A VISION,Then spoke the Christ (so wondrous was my vision)
2550,A VISION,"(Deep, deep, His voice, with sorrow’s cadence fraught):"
2551,A VISION,‘This world to-day would be a realm elysian
2552,A VISION,Had my disciples lived the love I taught.
2553,A VISION,Un-Christlike is the Christian creed men fashion
2554,A VISION,"Who kneel to worship, and who rise to slay."
2555,A VISION,"Profane pretenders of my holy Passion,"
2556,A VISION,Ye nail Me newly to the cross each day.’
