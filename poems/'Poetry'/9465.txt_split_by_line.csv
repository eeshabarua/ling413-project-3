25,I,I
26,I,
27,I,Last night I dreamed this dream: That I was dead;
28,I,"And as I slept, forgot of man and God,"
29,I,"That other dreamless sleep of rest,"
30,I,"I heard a footstep on the sod,"
31,I,"As of one passing overhead,--"
32,I,"And lo, thou, Dear, didst touch me on the breast,"
33,I,"Saying: ""What shall I write against thy name"
34,I,"That men should see?"""
35,I,"Then quick the answer came,"
36,I,"""I was beloved of thee."""
37,I,
38,I,
39,II,II
40,II,
41,II,"Dear Giver of Thyself when at thy side,"
42,II,"I see the path beyond divide,"
43,II,"Where we must walk alone a little space,"
44,II,"I say: ""Now am I strong indeed"
45,II,"To wait with only memory awhile,"
46,II,"Content, until I see thy face,--"""
47,II,"Yet turn, as one in sorest need,"
48,II,"To ask once more thy giving grace,"
49,II,"So, at the last"
50,II,"Of all our partings, when the night"
51,II,Has hidden from my failing sight
52,II,"The comfort of thy smile,"
53,II,My hand shall seek thine own to hold it fast;
54,II,"Nor wilt thou think for this the heart ingrate,"
55,II,"Less glad for all its past,"
56,II,Less strong to bear the utmost of its fate.
57,II,
58,II,
59,III,III
60,III,
61,III,"As once through forest shade I went,"
62,III,"I heard a flower call, and bent--"
63,III,Then strove to go. Should love not spare?
64,III,"""Nay, Dearest, this is love's sweet share"
65,III,"Of selfishness. For which is best,"
66,III,To die alone or on thy breast?
67,III,"If thou hast heard my call,"
68,III,"Take fearlessly, thou art my guest--"
69,III,"To give is all"""
70,III,"Hush! O Love, thou casuist!"
71,III,
72,III,
73,IV,IV
74,IV,
75,IV,"Ask me not why,--I only _know_,"
76,IV,It were thy loss if I could show
77,IV,Thee cause as for a lesser thing.
78,IV,"Remember how we searched the spring,"
79,IV,"But found no source,--so clear the sky"
80,IV,"Within its earth bound depths did lie,"
81,IV,"Give to thy joy its wings,"
82,IV,"And to thy heart its song, nor try"
83,IV,With questionings
84,IV,The throbbing throat that sings.
85,IV,
86,IV,
87,V,V
88,V,
89,V,For in thy clear and steadfast eyes
90,V,"Thine own self wonder deepest lies,"
91,V,Nor any words that lips can teach
92,V,Are sweeter than their wonder speech.
93,V,"And when thou givest them to me,"
94,V,"Through dawns of tenderness I see,--"
95,V,"As in the water-sky,"
96,V,The sun of certainly appear.
97,V,"So, _ask_ me why,"
98,V,"For then thou knowest, Dear."
99,V,
100,V,
101,VI,VI
102,VI,
103,VI,"To give is more than to receive, men say."
104,VI,"But thou hast made them one! What if, some day,"
105,VI,"Men bade me render back the gifts I cannot pay,--"
106,VI,Since all were undeserved! should I obey?
107,VI,"Lo, all these years of giving, when we try"
108,VI,"To own our thanks, we hear the giver cry;"
109,VI,"""Nay, it was thou who givest, Dear, not I."""
110,VI,"If Wisdom smile, let Wisdom go!"
111,VI,All things above
112,VI,"This is the truest; that we know because we love,"
113,VI,Not love because we know.
114,VI,
115,VI,
116,VII,VII
117,VII,
118,VII,"Let it not grieve thee, Dear, that Love is sad,"
119,VII,"Who, changeless, loveth so the things that change,--"
120,VII,"The morning in thine eyes, the dusk within thy hair,"
121,VII,Were it not strange
122,VII,If he were glad
123,VII,"Who cannot keep thy heart from care,"
124,VII,Or shelter from the whip of pain
125,VII,The bosom where his head hath lain?
126,VII,"Poor sentinel, that may not guard"
127,VII,The door that love itself unbarred!
128,VII,Who in the sweetness
129,VII,"Of his service knows its incompleteness,"
130,VII,And while he sings
131,VII,"Of life eternal, feels the coldness of Death's wings."
132,VII,
133,VII,
134,VIII,VIII
135,VIII,
136,VIII,"Stoop with me, Dearest, to the grass"
137,VIII,One little moment ere we pass
138,VIII,"From out these parched and thirsty lands,"
139,VIII,See! all these tiny blades are hands
140,VIII,"Stretched supplicating to the sky,"
141,VIII,"And listen, Dearest, patiently,--"
142,VIII,Dost thou not hear them move?
143,VIII,"The myriad roots that search, and cry"
144,VIII,"As hearts do, Love,"
145,VIII,"""Feed us, or let us die!"""
146,VIII,
147,VIII,
148,IX,IX
149,IX,
150,IX,"Beloved, when far up the mountain side"
151,IX,"We found, almost at eventide,"
152,IX,"Our spring, how far we did fear"
153,IX,Lest it should dare the trackless wood
154,IX,And disappear!
155,IX,And lost all heart when on the crest we stood
156,IX,And saw it spent in mist below!
157,IX,"Yet ever surer was its flow,"
158,IX,"And, ever gathering to its own"
159,IX,"New springs of which we had not known,"
160,IX,To fairer meadows
161,IX,Swept exultant from the woodland shadows;
162,IX,And when at last upon the baffling plain
163,IX,"We thought it scattered like a ravelled skein,--"
164,IX,"Lo, tranquil, free,"
165,IX,"Its longed-for home, the wide unfathomable sea!"
166,IX,
167,IX,
168,X,X
169,X,
170,X,Thy names are like sweet flowers that grow
171,X,"Within a garden where I go,"
172,X,"Sometimes at dawn, to see each one"
173,X,Life its head proudly in the sun;
174,X,"Sometimes at night,"
175,X,"When only by the fragrant air,"
176,X,I know them there.
177,X,And none are grieved or think I slight
178,X,"Their worth, if closest to my breast,"
179,X,This one I take which holds within its own
180,X,"Each single fragrance of the rest,--"
181,X,"My friend, my friend!"
182,X,"And as I loved it first alone,"
183,X,"So shall I love it to the end,"
184,X,For none were half so dear were it not best.
185,X,
186,X,
187,XI,XI
188,XI,
189,XI,"My every purpose fashioned by some thought of thee,"
190,XI,Though as a feather's weight that shapes the arrow's flight it be;
191,XI,"No single joy complete in which thou hast no fee,"
192,XI,Though thy share be the star and mine its shadow in the sea;
193,XI,"Thy very pulse my pulse, thy every prayer my prayer."
194,XI,"Thy love my blue o'erreaching sky that bounds me everywhere,--"
195,XI,"Yet free, Beloved, free! for this encircling air"
196,XI,"I cannot leave behind, doth but love's boundlessness declare."
197,XI,
198,XI,
199,XII,XII
200,XII,
201,XII,Last night the angel of remembrance brought
202,XII,"Me while I slept--think, Dear! of all his store"
203,XII,Just that one memory I thought
204,XII,Banished forever from our door!
205,XII,Thy sob of pain when once I hurt thee sure.
206,XII,Then in my dream I suddenly was ware
207,XII,"Of God above me saying: ""Reach"
208,XII,"Thy hand to Me in prayer,"
209,XII,"And I will give thee pardon yet."""
210,XII,"Thou? Nay, she hath forgiven, teach"
211,XII,Her to forget.
212,XII,
213,XII,
214,XIII,XIII
215,XIII,
216,XIII,"Love me not, Dearest, for the smile,"
217,XIII,"The tender greeting, or the wile"
218,XIII,"By which, unconscious of its road,"
219,XIII,My soul seeks thine in its abode;
220,XIII,"Nor say ""I love thee of thine eyes,--"""
221,XIII,"For when Death shuts them, where thy skies?"
222,XIII,"But love me for my love,"
223,XIII,"Then am I safe from all surprise,"
224,XIII,And thou above
225,XIII,The loss of all that dies.
226,XIII,
227,XIII,
228,XIV,XIV
229,XIV,
230,XIV,"Dear hands, forgiving hands,"
231,XIV,There is no speech so sure as thing.
232,XIV,Lips falter with so much
233,XIV,"To tell, eyes fill with thoughts I scarce divine,"
234,XIV,But thy least touch
235,XIV,Soul understands.
236,XIV,"Dear giving, taking hands,"
237,XIV,There are no gifts so free as thine.
238,XIV,"One last gem from the heart of the mine,"
239,XIV,"One last cup from the veins of the vine,"
240,XIV,"From the rose to the wind one last sweet breath,"
241,XIV,"Then poverty, and death!"
242,XIV,But thy dear palms
243,XIV,"Are richest empty, asking alms."
244,XIV,
245,XIV,
246,XV,XV
247,XV,
248,XV,A little moment at the end
249,XV,"Of day, left over in the candle light"
250,XV,"On the shore of dreams, on the edge of sleep,"
251,XV,"Too small to throw away,"
252,XV,Too poor to keep!
253,XV,"But it holds two words for thee, dear Friend,--"
254,XV,"Good-night, Good night!"
255,XV,"And so this remnant of the day,"
256,XV,Left over in the candle-light
257,XV,"On the shore of dreams, on the edge of sleep,"
258,XV,"Becomes too great to throw away,"
259,XV,Too dear to keep!
260,XV,
261,XV,
262,XVI,XVI
263,XVI,
264,XVI,"Beloved, when I read some fine conceit,"
265,XVI,Wherein are wrought as in glass
266,XVI,"The features love hath made so sweet,"
267,XVI,I marvel at so bold an art;
268,XVI,Seeing thou art too dear to praise
269,XVI,Upon the highway where men pass.
270,XVI,For when I seek
271,XVI,To tell the ways
272,XVI,God's hand of tenderness
273,XVI,"Hath touched thine earthly part,"
274,XVI,Again I hear
275,XVI,"Thy first own cry of happiness,"
276,XVI,"And, sweetest of God's sounds, the dear"
277,XVI,"Remonstrance of thy giving heart,--"
278,XVI,And cannot speak!
279,XVI,
280,XVI,
281,XVII,XVII
282,XVII,
283,XVII,Across the plain of Time
284,XVII,"I saw them marching all night long,--"
285,XVII,The endless throng
286,XVII,Of all who ever dared to fight with wrong.
287,XVII,"All the blood of their hearts, the prime"
288,XVII,"And crown of their fleeting years,"
289,XVII,"All the toil of their hands, the tears"
290,XVII,"Of their eyes, the thought of their brain,"
291,XVII,"For a word from the lips of Truth,"
292,XVII,"For a glimpse of the scroll of Fate,"
293,XVII,Ere love and youth
294,XVII,"Were spent in vain,"
295,XVII,And even truth too late!
296,XVII,"Oh, when the Silence speaks, and the scroll"
297,XVII,"Unrolls to the eye of the soul,"
298,XVII,What will it be that shall pay the cost
299,XVII,Of the pain gone waste and the labor lost!
300,XVII,"And then, Dear, waking, I saw you---"
301,XVII,And knew.
302,XVII,
303,XVII,
304,XVIII,XVIII
305,XVIII,
306,XVIII,"We thought when Love at last should come,"
307,XVIII,"The rose would lose its thorn,"
308,XVIII,And every lip but Joy's be dumb
309,XVIII,"When Love, sweet Love, was born;"
310,XVIII,"That never tears should start to rise,"
311,XVIII,"No night o'ertake our morn,"
312,XVIII,"Nor any guest of grief surprise,"
313,XVIII,"When Love, sweet Love, was born."
314,XVIII,
315,XVIII,"And when he came, O Heart of mine!"
316,XVIII,"And stood within our door,"
317,XVIII,No joy our dreaming could divine
318,XVIII,Was missing from his store.
319,XVIII,"The thorns shall wound our hearts again,"
320,XVIII,"But not the fear of yore,"
321,XVIII,for all the guests of grief and pain
322,XVIII,Shall serve him evermore.

327,XIX,"Dost thou remember, Dear, the day"
328,XIX,We met in those bare woods of May?
329,XIX,"Each had a secret unconfessed,"
330,XIX,"Each sound a promise, in each nest."
331,XIX,"Young wings a-tremble for the air,--"
332,XIX,How we joined hands?--not knowing where
333,XIX,The springs that touch set free
334,XIX,Should find their sea.
335,XIX,Speechless--so sure we were to share
336,XIX,The unknown good to be.

338,XIX,
339,XX,XX
340,XX,
341,XX,The woods are bare again. There are
342,XX,"No secrets now, the bud's a scar;"
343,XX,"No promises,--this is the end!"
344,XX,"Ah, Dearest, I have seen thee bend"
345,XX,Above thy flowers as one who knew
346,XX,The dying wood should bloom anew.
347,XX,"Come, let us sleep, Perchance"
348,XX,"God's countenance,"
349,XX,"Like thine above thy flowers, smiles through"
350,XX,The night upon us two.

360,MY FRIEND,
361,MY FRIEND,"I have a friend who came,--I know not how,"
362,MY FRIEND,"Nor he. Among the crowd, apart,"
363,MY FRIEND,"I feel the pressure of his hand, and hear"
364,MY FRIEND,In very truth the beating of his heart.
365,MY FRIEND,
366,MY FRIEND,"My soul had shut the door of abode,"
367,MY FRIEND,So poor it seemed for any guest
368,MY FRIEND,"To tarry there a night,--until he came,"
369,MY FRIEND,"Asking, not entertainment, only rest."
370,MY FRIEND,
371,MY FRIEND,"Our hands were empty,-his and mine alike,"
372,MY FRIEND,He says--until they joined. I see
373,MY FRIEND,The gifts he brought; but where were mine
374,MY FRIEND,"That he should say ""I too have need of thee?"""
375,MY FRIEND,
376,MY FRIEND,Without the threshold of his heart I wait
377,MY FRIEND,"Abashed, afraid to enter where"
378,MY FRIEND,"So radiant a company do meet,"
379,MY FRIEND,"Yet enter boldly, knowing I am there."
380,MY FRIEND,
381,MY FRIEND,"Whether his hand shall press my latch to-night,"
382,MY FRIEND,"To-morrow, matters not. He came"
383,MY FRIEND,"Unsummoned, he will come again; and I,"
384,MY FRIEND,"Though dead, shall answer to my name."
385,MY FRIEND,
386,MY FRIEND,"And yet, dear friend, in whom I rest content,"
387,MY FRIEND,Speak to me _now_--lest when we meet
388,MY FRIEND,"Where tears and hunger have no grace,"
389,MY FRIEND,A little word of friendship be less sweet.

416,ON NE BADINE PAS AVEC LA MORT,As in winter's hand the rivers do.
417,ON NE BADINE PAS AVEC LA MORT,"How could he hear its secret cry,"
418,ON NE BADINE PAS AVEC LA MORT,The cry of the dove when the cummers die!
