19,POETRY,"""Trust in good verses then:"
20,POETRY,"They only shall aspire,"
21,POETRY,"When pyramids, as men"
22,POETRY,"Are lost i'the funeral fire."""
23,POETRY,
24,POETRY,"As the tale is told by Plato, in the tenth book of his _Republic_, one"
25,POETRY,"Er the son of Arminius, a Pamphylian, was slain in battle; and ten days"
26,POETRY,"afterwards, when they collected the bodies for burial, his body alone"
27,POETRY,"showed no taint of corruption. His relatives, however, bore it off to"
28,POETRY,"the funeral pile; and on the twelfth day, lying there, he returned to"
29,POETRY,life and told them what he had seen in the other world. Many wonders he
30,POETRY,"related concerning the dead, for example, with their rewards and"
31,POETRY,punishments: but most wonderful of all was the great Spindle of
32,POETRY,Necessity which he saw reaching up into heaven with the planets
33,POETRY,"revolving around it in whorls of graduated width and speed, yet all"
34,POETRY,concentric and so timed that all complete the full circle punctually
35,POETRY,"together.--""The Spindle turns on the knees of Necessity: and on the rim"
36,POETRY,"of each whorl sits perched a Siren, who goes round with it, hymning a"
37,POETRY,"single note; the eight notes together forming one harmony."""
38,POETRY,
39,POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
40,POETRY,
41,POETRY,The fable is a pretty one: but Er the Pamphylian comes back to report no
42,POETRY,more than the one thing Man already grasps for a certainty amid his
43,POETRY,welter of guesswork about the Universe--that its stability rests on
44,POETRY,"ordered motion--that the ""firmament"" stands firm on a balance of active"
45,POETRY,"and tremendous forces somehow harmoniously composed. Theology asks ""By"
46,POETRY,"_whom_?"": Philosophy inclines rather to guess ""_How?_"" Natural Science,"
47,POETRY,"allowing that these questions are probably unanswerable, contents itself"
48,POETRY,with mapping and measuring what it can of the various forces. But all
49,POETRY,agree about the harmony: and when a Newton discovers a single rule of it
50,POETRY,"for us, he but makes our assurance surer."
51,POETRY,
52,POETRY,"For uncounted centuries before ever hearing of ""Gravitation"" men knew"
53,POETRY,"of the sun that he rose and set at hours which, though mysteriously"
54,POETRY,"appointed, could be accurately predicted; of the moon that she regularly"
55,POETRY,"waxed and waned, drawing the waters of the earth in a flow and ebb, the"
56,POETRY,gauge of which and the time-table could be advertised beforehand in the
57,POETRY,"almanack; of the stars, that they swung as by clockwork around the pole."
58,POETRY,Says the son of Sirach concerning them--
59,POETRY,
60,POETRY,"_At the word of the Holy one they will stand in due order,"
61,POETRY,And they will not faint in their watches._
62,POETRY,
63,POETRY,"So evident is this celestial harmony that men, seeking to account for it"
64,POETRY,"by what was most harmonious in themselves or in their experience,"
65,POETRY,supposed an actual Music of the Spheres inaudible to mortals; Plato (who
66,POETRY,"learned of Pythagoras) inventing his Octave of Sirens, spinning in the"
67,POETRY,whorls of the great planets and intoning as they spin; Chaucer (who
68,POETRY,learned of Dante and makes the spheres nine) in his _Parliament of
69,POETRY,"Foules_ telling, out of Cicero's _Somnium Scipionis_, how the great"
70,POETRY,Scipio Africanus visited his descendant in a dream and--
71,POETRY,
72,POETRY,"_Shewed he him the litel erthe, that heer is,"
73,POETRY,In regard of the hevenes quantité:
74,POETRY,"And after shewed he him the nynè sperés,"
75,POETRY,And after that the melodye herde he
76,POETRY,That cometh of thilke sperés thryés-three
77,POETRY,That welle is of musicke and melodye
78,POETRY,"In this world heer, and cause of armonye._"
79,POETRY,
80,POETRY,While Shakespeare in the last Act of _The Merchant of Venice_ makes all
81,POETRY,"the stars vocal, and not the planets only:"
82,POETRY,
83,POETRY,_There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdest
84,POETRY,"But in his motion like an angel sings,"
85,POETRY,Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims..._
86,POETRY,
87,POETRY,And Milton in _Arcades_ goes straight back to Plato (save that his
88,POETRY,"spheres are nine, as with Chaucer):"
89,POETRY,
90,POETRY,_then listen I
91,POETRY,To the celestial Sirens' harmony
92,POETRY,That sit upon the nine enfolded spheres
93,POETRY,And sing to those that hold the vital shears
94,POETRY,And turn the adamantine spindle round
95,POETRY,Of which the fate of gods and men is wound.
96,POETRY,Such sweet compulsion doth in music lie
97,POETRY,"To lull the daughters of Necessity,"
98,POETRY,"And keep unsteady Nature to her law,"
99,POETRY,And the low world in measured motion draw
100,POETRY,After the heavenly tune._
101,POETRY,
102,POETRY,"From the greater poets let us turn to a lesser one, whom we shall have"
103,POETRY,occasion to quote again by and by: to the _Orchestra_ of Sir John Davies
104,POETRY,"(1596), who sees this whole Universe treading the harmonious measures of"
105,POETRY,"a dance; and let us select one stanza, of the tides:"
106,POETRY,
107,POETRY,"_For lo, the sea that fleets about the land,"
108,POETRY,"And like a girdle clips her solid waist,"
109,POETRY,Music and Measure both doth understand;
110,POETRY,For his great Crystal Eye is always cast
111,POETRY,"Up to the Moon, and on her fixèd fast;"
112,POETRY,"And as she daunceth in her pallid sphere,"
113,POETRY,So daunceth he about the centre here._
114,POETRY,
115,POETRY,This may be fantastic. As the late Professor Skeat informed the world
116,POETRY,"solemnly in a footnote, ""Modern astronomy has exploded the singular"
117,POETRY,"notion of revolving hollow concentric spheres...."" (The Professor wrote"
118,POETRY,"""singular"" when he meant ""curious.""--The notion was never ""singular."")"
119,POETRY,"""These 'spheres,'"" he adds, ""have disappeared, and their music with"
120,POETRY,"them, except in poetry."" Nevertheless the fable presents a truth, and"
121,POETRY,one of the two most important truths in the world. This Universe is not
122,POETRY,"a Chaos. (If it were, by the way, we should be unable to reason about it"
123,POETRY,at all.) It stands and is continually renewed upon an ascertained
124,POETRY,"harmony: and what Plato called ""Necessity"" is the duty in all things of"
125,POETRY,"obedience to that harmony, the Duty of which Wordsworth sings in his"
126,POETRY,"noble Ode,"
127,POETRY,
128,POETRY,"_Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong,"
129,POETRY,"And his most ancient heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong._"
130,POETRY,
131,POETRY,Now the other and only equally important truth in the world is that this
132,POETRY,"macrocosm of the Universe, with its harmony, cannot be apprehended at"
133,POETRY,"all except as it is focussed upon the eye and intellect of Man, the"
134,POETRY,"microcosm. All ""transcendental"" philosophy,--all discussions of the"
135,POETRY,"""Absolute,"" of mind and matter, of ""subjective"" and ""objective"""
136,POETRY,"knowledge, of ""ideas"" and ""phenomena,"" ""flux"" and ""permanence""--all"
137,POETRY,"""systems"" and ""schools,"" down from the earliest to be found in ""Ritter"
138,POETRY,"and Preller,"" through Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Epicurus, on to Aquinas,"
139,POETRY,"to Abelard, to the great scholastic disputants between Realism and"
140,POETRY,"Nominalism; again on to Bacon, Spinoza, Locke, Comte, Hegel, and yet"
141,POETRY,"again on to James and Bergson--all inevitably work out to this, that the"
142,POETRY,Universal Harmony is meaningless and nothing to Man save in so far as he
143,POETRY,"apprehends it, and that he can only apprehend it by reference to some"
144,POETRY,"corresponding harmony within himself. Lacking him, the harmony (so far"
145,POETRY,as he knows) would utterly lack the compliment of an audience: by his
146,POETRY,"own faulty instrument he must seek to interpret it, if it is to be"
147,POETRY,"interpreted at all: and so, like the man at the piano, he goes on ""doing"
148,POETRY,"his best."""
149,POETRY,
150,POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
151,POETRY,
152,POETRY,"""God created Man in His image,"" says the Scripture: ""and,"" adds Heine,"
153,POETRY,"""Man made haste to return the compliment."" It sounds wicked, but is one"
154,POETRY,"of the truest things ever said. After all, and without vanity, it is the"
155,POETRY,"best compliment Man can pay, poor fellow!--and he goes on striving to"
156,POETRY,"pay it, though often enough rebuked for his zeal. ""Canst _thou_,"""
157,POETRY,demands the divine Interlocutor in the _Book of Job_--
158,POETRY,
159,POETRY,"_""Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands"
160,POETRY,of Orion? Canst thou bring forth Mazaroth in his season? Or canst thou
161,POETRY,"guide Arcturus with his sons?""_"
162,POETRY,
163,POETRY,"To this, fallen and arraigned man, using his best jargon, responds that"
164,POETRY,"""the answer is in the negative. I never pretended to _do_ these things,"
165,POETRY,"only to guess, in my small way, how they are done."""
166,POETRY,
167,POETRY,Nor is there any real irreverence in answering thus: for of course it is
168,POETRY,"not the Almighty who puts the questions, but someone audaciously"
169,POETRY,personating Him. And some of us find this pretension irritating; as
170,POETRY,Douglas Jerrold meeting a pompous stranger on the pavement was moved to
171,POETRY,"accost him with, ""I beg your pardon, Sir, but would you mind informing"
172,POETRY,"me--Are you anybody in particular?"""
173,POETRY,
174,POETRY,"Again, in the sixth chapter of the Second Book of Esdras, someone"
175,POETRY,usurping the voice of the Almighty and using (be it said to his credit)
176,POETRY,"excellent prose, declares:"
177,POETRY,
178,POETRY,"_""In the beginning, when the earth was made, before the waters of"
179,POETRY,"the world stood, or ever the wind blew,"
180,POETRY,
181,POETRY,"Before it thundered or lightened, or ever the foundations of"
182,POETRY,"paradise were laid,"
183,POETRY,
184,POETRY,"Before the fair flowers were seen, or ever_ _the moveable powers"
185,POETRY,were established; before the innumerable multitude of angels were
186,POETRY,"gathered together,"
187,POETRY,
188,POETRY,"Or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before the measures"
189,POETRY,"of the firmament were named, or ever the chimneys of Zion were hot._"
190,POETRY,
191,POETRY,"Then _did I consider these things, and they all were made through Me"
192,POETRY,"alone, and through none other: by Me also they shall be ended, and"
193,POETRY,"by none other.""_"
194,POETRY,
195,POETRY,It is all very beautiful: but (for aught that appears) no one was
196,POETRY,denying it. It has been shrewdly objected against the arguments of the
197,POETRY,"""affable Archangel"" in the later books of _Paradise Lost_ that argument"
198,POETRY,by its nature admits of being answered: and the fatal fallacy of putting
199,POETRY,"human speech into a divine mouth, as in the above passage, is that it"
200,POETRY,invites retort.
201,POETRY,
202,POETRY,A sensible man does not aspire to bind the sweet influences of Pleiades:
203,POETRY,"but he may, and does, aspire to understand something of the universal"
204,POETRY,"harmony in which he and they bear a part, if only that he may render it"
205,POETRY,"a more perfect obedience. ""Let me know,"" he craves, ""that I may accept"
206,POETRY,"my fate intelligently, even though it prove that under the iron rule of"
207,POETRY,"Necessity I have no more freedom of will than the dead,"
208,POETRY,
209,POETRY,_Roll'd round in earth's diurnal course
210,POETRY,"With rocks, and stones, and trees._"""
211,POETRY,
212,POETRY,The claim (as Man must think) is a just one--for why was he given
213,POETRY,intelligence if not to use it? And even though disallowed as
214,POETRY,"presumptuous, it is an instinctive one. Man is, after all, a part of the"
215,POETRY,"Universe, and just as surely as the Pleiades or Arcturus: and moreover"
216,POETRY,he _feels_ in himself a harmony correspondent with the greater harmony
217,POETRY,of his quest. His heart beats to a rhythm: his blood pulses through
218,POETRY,"steady circuits; like the plants by which he is fed, he comes to birth,"
219,POETRY,"grows, begets his kind, dies, and returns to earth; like the tides, his"
220,POETRY,days of gestation obey the moon and can be reckoned by her; in the sweat
221,POETRY,"of his body he tills the ground, and by the seasons, summer and winter,"
222,POETRY,"seedtime and harvest, his life while it lasts is regulated. But above"
223,POETRY,"all he is the microcosm, the tiny percipient centre upon which the"
224,POETRY,immense cosmic circle focusses itself as the sun upon a
225,POETRY,burning-glass--and he is not shrivelled up by the miracle! Other
226,POETRY,"creatures (he notes) share his sensations; but, so far as he can"
227,POETRY,"discover, not his intelligence--or, if at all, in no degree worth"
228,POETRY,"measuring. So far as he can detect, he is not only an actor in the grand"
229,POETRY,"cosmic pageant, but the sole intelligent spectator. As a poor Welsh"
230,POETRY,"parson, Thomas Traherne, wrote of the small town of his childhood:--"
231,POETRY,
232,POETRY,"_The streets were mine, the temple was mine, the people were mine, their"
233,POETRY,"clothes and gold and silver were mine, as much as their sparkling eyes,"
234,POETRY,"their skins and ruddy faces. The skies were mine, and so were the sun"
235,POETRY,"and moon and stars; and all the world was mine, and I the only spectator"
236,POETRY,and enjoyer of it...._
237,POETRY,
238,POETRY,_But little did the infant dream
239,POETRY,That all the treasures of the world were by;
240,POETRY,And that himself was so the cream
241,POETRY,And crown of all which round about did lie.
242,POETRY,"Yet thus it was: the Gem,"
243,POETRY,"The Diadem,"
244,POETRY,The ring enclosing all
245,POETRY,"That stood upon this earthly ball,"
246,POETRY,"The heavenly Eye,"
247,POETRY,Much wider than the sky
248,POETRY,"Wherein they all included were,"
249,POETRY,"The glorious soul that was the King,"
250,POETRY,"Made to possess them, did appear"
251,POETRY,A small and little thing!_
252,POETRY,
253,POETRY,"We may safely go some way even beyond this, and lay it down for"
254,POETRY,unchallengeable truth that over and above Man's consciousness of being
255,POETRY,"the eye of the Universe and receptacle, however imperfect, of its great"
256,POETRY,"harmony, he has a native impulse to merge himself in that harmony and be"
257,POETRY,"one with it: a spirit in his heart (as the Scripture puts it) ""of"
258,POETRY,"adoption, whereby we cry, _Abba, Father_""--_And because ye are sons, God"
259,POETRY,"hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba,"
260,POETRY,Father._ In his daily life he is for ever seeking after harmony in
261,POETRY,"avoidance of chaos, cultivating personal habits after the clock; in his"
262,POETRY,"civic life forming governments, attempting hierarchies, laws,"
263,POETRY,"constitutions, by which (as he hopes) a system of society will work in"
264,POETRY,"tune, almost automatically. When he fights he has learnt that his"
265,POETRY,"fighting men shall march in rhythm and deploy rhythmically, and they do"
266,POETRY,"so to regimental music. If he haul rope or weigh anchor, setting out to"
267,POETRY,"sea, or haul up his ship on a beach, he has proved by experiment that"
268,POETRY,these operations are performed more than twice as easily when done to a
269,POETRY,"tune. But these are dull, less than half-conscious, imitations of the"
270,POETRY,"great harmony for which, when he starts out to understand and interpret"
271,POETRY,"it consciously, he must use the most godlike of all his gifts. Now the"
272,POETRY,most godlike of all human gifts--the singular gift separating Man from
273,POETRY,the brutes--is speech. If he can harmonise speech he has taught his
274,POETRY,"first and peculiar faculty to obey the great rhythm: ""I will sing and"
275,POETRY,"give praise,"" says the Psalmist, ""with the best member that I have."""
276,POETRY,"Thus by harmonising speech (in a fashion we will discuss by and by), he"
277,POETRY,arrives at _Poetry_.
278,POETRY,
279,POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
280,POETRY,
281,POETRY,"But an objection may be raised. ""_Is_ the tongue, rather than the brain,"
282,POETRY,"the best member that I have?"" or (to put it in another way), ""Surely a"
283,POETRY,man's _thoughts_ about the Universe have more value than his words about
284,POETRY,"it?"""
285,POETRY,
286,POETRY,"The answer is, that we cannot separate them: and Newman has put this so"
287,POETRY,"cogently that I must quote him, making no attempt to water down his"
288,POETRY,"argument with words of my own. ""Thought and speech are inseparable from"
289,POETRY,one another. Matter and expression are parts of one: style is a thinking
290,POETRY,"out into language. This is literature; not _things_, but the verbal"
291,POETRY,"symbols of things; not on the other hand mere _words_, but thoughts"
292,POETRY,expressed in language. Call to mind the meaning of the Greek word which
293,POETRY,expresses this special prerogative of Man over the feeble intelligence
294,POETRY,of the lower animals. It is called Logos. What does Logos mean? It
295,POETRY,"stands both for _reason_ and for _speech_, and it is difficult to say"
296,POETRY,which means more properly. It means both at once: why? Because really
297,POETRY,"they cannot be divided.... When we can separate light and illumination,"
298,POETRY,"life and motion, the convex and the concave of a curve, then will it be"
299,POETRY,possible for thought to tread speech under foot and to hope to do
300,POETRY,without it--then will it be conceivable that the vigorous and fertile
301,POETRY,"intellect should renounce its own double, its instrument of expression"
302,POETRY,"and the channel of its speculations and emotions."" Words, in short, are"
303,POETRY,"the outward and visible signs of thought: that, and something"
304,POETRY,more--since you may prove by experiment that the shortest and simplest
305,POETRY,train of thought cannot be followed unless at every step the mind
306,POETRY,silently casts it into the mould of words.
307,POETRY,
308,POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
309,POETRY,
310,POETRY,As an instrument for reconciling Man's inward harmony with the great
311,POETRY,"outer harmony of the Universe, Poetry is notoriously imperfect. Men have"
312,POETRY,tried others therefore--others that appeared at first sight more
313,POETRY,"promising, such as Music and Mathematics--yet on the whole to their"
314,POETRY,disappointment.
315,POETRY,
316,POETRY,Take Mathematics. Numbers inhere in all harmony. By numbers harmony can
317,POETRY,"be expressed far more severely than by Poetry, and so successfully up to"
318,POETRY,"a point, that poets have borrowed the very word to dignify their poor"
319,POETRY,"efforts. They ""lisp in numbers""--or so they say: and the curious may"
320,POETRY,"turn to the _Parmenides_, to Book vii. of _The Republic_ and others of"
321,POETRY,"the _Dialogues_ and note how Plato, hunting on the trail of many"
322,POETRY,"distinguished predecessors, pursues Mathematics up to the point where,"
323,POETRY,"as a means of interpreting to Man the Universal harmony, Mathematics,"
324,POETRY,"like Philosophy, inevitably breaks down. Mathematics, an abstract"
325,POETRY,"science, breaks down just because it is abstract and in no way personal:"
326,POETRY,because though it may calculate and time and even weigh parts of the
327,POETRY,"greater Universe, it cannot, by defect of its nature, bring its"
328,POETRY,discoveries back to bear on the other harmony of Man. It is impersonal
329,POETRY,and therefore nescient of his need. Though by such a science he gain the
330,POETRY,"whole world, it shall not profit a man who misses from it his own soul."
331,POETRY,
332,POETRY,"Philosophy, too, fails us over this same crux of ""personality""; not by"
333,POETRY,"ignoring it, but by clinging with obstinacy to the wrong end of the"
334,POETRY,stick. The quarrel between Philosophy and Poetry is notorious and
335,POETRY,inveterate: and at ninety-nine points in the hundred Philosophy has the
336,POETRY,better of the dispute; as the Fox in the fable had ninety-nine ways of
337,POETRY,"evading the hounds, against the Cat's solitary one. But the Cat could"
338,POETRY,climb a tree.
339,POETRY,
340,POETRY,"So Philosophy has almost all the say in this matter, until Poetry"
341,POETRY,"interjects the fatal question, ""I beg your pardon, Madam, but do you"
342,POETRY,"happen to be the Almighty, or are you playing Egeria to his Numa? You"
343,POETRY,are constructing admirably comprehensive schemes and systems for _His_
344,POETRY,"guidance, if your hints will but be taken. But if you address yourself"
345,POETRY,"to Man, you will find that his business is not at all to _comprehend_"
346,POETRY,"the Universe; for this, if he could achieve it, would make him equal"
347,POETRY,"with God. What he more humbly aspires to, is to _apprehend_; to pierce"
348,POETRY,"by flashes of insight to some inch or so of the secret, to some star to"
349,POETRY,"which he can hitch his waggon. Now there are,"" Poetry goes on, ""certain"
350,POETRY,"men, granted to dwell among us, of more delicate mental fibre than their"
351,POETRY,fellows; men whose minds have as it were exquisite filaments which they
352,POETRY,"throw out to intercept, _apprehend_ and conduct home to Man stray"
353,POETRY,messages between the outer mystery of the Universe and the inner mystery
354,POETRY,"of his soul; even as modern telegraphy has learnt to search out, snatch"
355,POETRY,and gather home messages wandering astray over waste waters of Ocean.
356,POETRY,"Such men are the poets, my servants."""
357,POETRY,
358,POETRY,"""Moreover,"" Poetry will continue, ""these men do not collect their"
359,POETRY,"messages as your philosophers do, by vigorous striving and learning;"
360,POETRY,"nor, as the priests of Baal did, by cutting themselves and crying; but"
361,POETRY,by schooling their souls to harmony and awaiting the moment of
362,POETRY,apprehension with what one of them has called 'a wise passiveness.' For
363,POETRY,"it is not their method to wrestle with God, like Jacob, or to hold Him"
364,POETRY,up with a 'Stand and deliver.' It is enough for them to be receptacles
365,POETRY,"of His passing breath, as the harps abandoned and hung on willow-trees"
366,POETRY,"by the waters of Babylon may have caught, at evening, and hummed the"
367,POETRY,"wind whispering from Israel. And for this, while they hang and wait,"
368,POETRY,"they will be despised by the commonalty for indolent fellows, as indeed"
369,POETRY,"they are; as when the wind inspires and sets them hymning, they will be"
370,POETRY,"accused of insobriety. Yet always they excel your philosophers, insomuch"
371,POETRY,as they accept the transcendental as really transcendental and do not
372,POETRY,"profess to instruct the Almighty in it; and chiefly, perhaps, they excel"
373,POETRY,"your philosophers by opposing a creativeness, potential at any rate,"
374,POETRY,against a certain and foredoomed barrenness. For the philosophers would
375,POETRY,"get at the secret by reason, contemning emotion; whereas the poet knows"
376,POETRY,"that creation implies fatherhood, and fatherhood implies emotion, even"
377,POETRY,passionate emotion. It is (take it as a cold fact) only on the impulse
378,POETRY,"of yearning, on the cry of Abba, that the creature can leap to any real"
379,POETRY,"understanding of the Creator."""
380,POETRY,
381,POETRY,"Yet the philosopher will go on to the end of time despising the poet,"
382,POETRY,"who grasps at mysteries _per saltum_, neglecting the military road of"
383,POETRY,logic.
384,POETRY,
385,POETRY,"Shall we then, by a violent recoil, abandon Mathematics and Philosophy"
386,POETRY,"and commit our faith to Music? Music is, above all things, harmonious:"
387,POETRY,Music has the emotion in which Mathematics and Philosophy have been
388,POETRY,"found wanting. Music can be ""personal""; Music, since the invention of"
389,POETRY,"counterpoint, is capable of harmonies deeper and more intricate than any"
390,POETRY,"within the range of human speech. In short, against Poetry, Music can"
391,POETRY,set up a very strong claim.
392,POETRY,
393,POETRY,But first we note that--_securus judicat orbis terrarum_--in the
394,POETRY,beginning Poetry and Music did their business together (with the Dance
395,POETRY,"conjoined as third partner); and that, by practice, men have tended to"
396,POETRY,"trust Poetry, for an interpreter, more and more above Music, while"
397,POETRY,"Dancing has dropped out of the competition. The ballad, the sonnet, have"
398,POETRY,"grown to stand on their merits as verse, though their names--_ballata,"
399,POETRY,sonata_--imply that they started in dependence upon dance and
400,POETRY,"orchestra. This supersession of music by verse, whether as ally or"
401,POETRY,"competitor, is a historical fact, if a startling one, which Mr."
402,POETRY,"Watts-Dunton, in his famous article on Poetry in the _Encyclopædia"
403,POETRY,"Britannica_, has been at pains to examine. He starts by admitting a"
404,POETRY,"little more than I should grant. ""There is one great point of"
405,POETRY,"superiority,"" says he, ""that musical art exhibits over metrical art."
406,POETRY,"This consists, not in the capacity for melody, but in the capacity for"
407,POETRY,"harmony in the musician's sense...."" ""Why, of course,"" is my comment"
408,POETRY,"upon this: ""every art can easily claim excellence, if it take that"
409,POETRY,"excellence in its own sense."" Mr. Watts-Dunton proceeds: ""The finest"
410,POETRY,"music of Æschylus, of Pindar, of Shakespeare, of Milton, is after all,"
411,POETRY,"only a succession of melodious notes, and in endeavouring to catch the"
412,POETRY,"harmonic intent of strophe, antistrophe and epode in the Greek chorus"
413,POETRY,"and in the true ode (that of Pindar), we can only succeed by pressing"
414,POETRY,"memory into our service."" But I, for one, should not seek counterpoint"
415,POETRY,in these any more than in the recurrent themes of a sonata. I should
416,POETRY,"seek it rather in the running line which he pronounces (mistakenly, as I"
417,POETRY,"think) to be ""after all, only a succession of melodious notes."" C sharp,"
418,POETRY,"B, A, A, A, E, A are a succession of melodious notes and spell the"
419,POETRY,"opening phrase of ""The Death of Nelson"": as the vowels E, O, U, U, O, O,"
420,POETRY,"E, E, U are a succession of melodious notes, and, if notes alone"
421,POETRY,"counted, would spell a phrase of Milton's great Invocation to Light. But"
422,POETRY,"when we consider the consonantal value, the interplay and the exquisite"
423,POETRY,repetition of--
424,POETRY,
425,POETRY,_Seasons return; but not to me returns
426,POETRY,"Day,..._"
427,POETRY,
428,POETRY,"or note the vowel-peals throughout the passage, now shut and anon opened"
429,POETRY,"by the scheme of consonants; now continuous, anon modulated by delicate"
430,POETRY,pauses; always chiming obediently to the strain of thought; then I hold
431,POETRY,"that if we have not actual counterpoint here, we have something"
432,POETRY,"remarkably like it,--as we certainly have harmony--"
433,POETRY,
434,POETRY,_thoughts that move
435,POETRY,"Harmonious numbers,_"
436,POETRY,
437,POETRY,"or I know not what harmony is. In truth, if counterpoint be (as the"
438,POETRY,"dictionary defines it), ""a blending of related but independent"
439,POETRY,"melodies,"" then Poetry achieves it by mating a process of sound to a"
440,POETRY,process of thought: and Mr. Watts-Dunton disposes of his own first
441,POETRY,"contention for music when he goes on to say (very rightly), ""But if"
442,POETRY,"Poetry falls behind Music in rhythmic scope, it is capable of rendering"
443,POETRY,"emotion after emotion has become disintegrated into thoughts."" Yet I"
444,POETRY,"should still object to the word ""disintegrated"" as applied to thought,"
445,POETRY,unless it be allowed that emotion undergoes the same process at the same
446,POETRY,"time and both meet in one solution. To speak more plainly, Music is"
447,POETRY,"inferior to Poetry because, of any two melodies in its counterpoint,"
448,POETRY,both may be (and in practice are) emotional and vague: while of any two
449,POETRY,melodies in the counterpoint of Poetry one must convey thought and
450,POETRY,"therefore be intelligible. And, to speak summarily, Poetry surpasses"
451,POETRY,"Music because it carries its explanation, whereas the meaning of a"
452,POETRY,_concerto_ has to be interpreted into dull words on a programme.
453,POETRY,
454,POETRY,"We have arrived at this, then; that Poetry's chief function is to"
455,POETRY,"reconcile the inner harmony of Man (his Soul, as we call it) with the"
456,POETRY,"outer harmony of the Universe. With this conception of ""peerless Poesie"""
457,POETRY,"in our minds, we turn to Aristotle's _Poetics_, and it gives us a"
458,POETRY,"sensible shock to read on the first page, that ""Epic Poetry and Tragedy,"
459,POETRY,"Comedy also and dithyrambic Poetry, and the greater part of the music of"
460,POETRY,"the flute and of the lyre are all, generally speaking, modes of"
461,POETRY,"imitation"" ([Greek: _pasai tynchhanoysin ohysai mimhêseis to hynolon_])."
462,POETRY,"""What?"" we say--""Nothing better than _that_?""--for ""imitation"" has a bad"
463,POETRY,"name among men and is apt to suggest the ape. But, first bearing in mind"
464,POETRY,that there are imitations and imitations (the _Imitatio Christi_ among
465,POETRY,"them), let us go on to see what it is that in Aristotle's opinion Poetry"
466,POETRY,"imitates or copies. It is ""the Universal"" ([Greek: _tho chathholoy_]):"
467,POETRY,and as soon as we realise this we know ourselves to be on the same track
468,POETRY,"as Aristotle, after all. ""Imitation,"" as he uses it, is not an apish or"
469,POETRY,a slavish imitation; it is no mere transcribing or copying of phenomena
470,POETRY,"as they pass (he even allows that the poet may ""imitate"" men as ""better"
471,POETRY,"than they are""): it is an expressing, in fiction and harmonious speech,"
472,POETRY,"intelligible to his fellow-men, of what truth, order, harmony, and ""law"""
473,POETRY,the poet's mind has apprehended in the outer Universe. No fair-minded
474,POETRY,"reader of the _Poetics_, as he lays down the treatise, will doubt that"
475,POETRY,"this, or something like this, was Aristotle's meaning, nor is it"
476,POETRY,probable that he will find any essential difference (or any difference
477,POETRY,"that seriously disturbs agreement) between Aristotle's ""Universal"" and"
478,POETRY,"the Platonic ""Idea"" or pattern of things ""laid up somewhere in the"
479,POETRY,"heavens."""

481,POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
482,POETRY,
483,POETRY,Now the Poet's way of apprehending the Universal is (as I have
484,POETRY,"indicated) by keeping true to himself, attending to his soul's inner"
485,POETRY,"harmony, and listening, waiting, brooding with a ""wise passiveness"""
486,POETRY,until the moment when his and the larger harmony fall into tune
487,POETRY,"together. The Psalmist describes the process accurately: ""While I was"
488,POETRY,"thus musing the fire kindled, and at the last I spake with my tongue."""
489,POETRY,"""Poetry,"" writes Shelley, ""is not, like reasoning, a power to be exerted"
490,POETRY,"according to the determination of the will. A man cannot say, _I will"
491,POETRY,"compose poetry_. The greatest poet, even, cannot say it: for the mind in"
492,POETRY,"creation is as a fading coal, which some invisible influence, like an"
493,POETRY,"inconstant wind, awakens to transitory brightness."" But the Poet's way"
494,POETRY,"of reporting these apprehensions to his fellows, since he deals with"
495,POETRY,"Universals or ideas, is by ""universalising"" or ""idealising"" his story:"
496,POETRY,"and upon these two terms, which properly mean much the same thing, we"
497,POETRY,must pause for a moment.
498,POETRY,
499,POETRY,"The word ""idealise,"" which is the more commonly used, has unfortunately"
500,POETRY,"two meanings, a true and a false; and, again unfortunately, the false"
501,POETRY,"prevails in vulgar use. To ""idealise"" in the true sense is to disengage"
502,POETRY,"an ""idea"" of all that is trivial or impertinent or transient or"
503,POETRY,"disturbing, and present it to men in its clearest outline, so that its"
504,POETRY,"own proper form shines in on the intelligence, as you would wipe away"
505,POETRY,from a discovered statue all stains or accretions of mud or moss or
506,POETRY,"fungus, to release and reveal its true beauty. False ""idealising,"" on"
507,POETRY,"the other hand, means that, instead of trusting to this naked"
508,POETRY,"manifestation, we add to it some graces of our invention, some touches"
509,POETRY,"by which we think to improve it; that we ""paint the lily,"" in short. But"
510,POETRY,"the true ""idealisation"" and the first business of the poet is a"
511,POETRY,"_denuding_ not an _investing_ of the Goddess, whether her name be"
512,POETRY,"""Life,"" ""Truth,"" ""Beauty,"" or what you will: a revealing, not a"
513,POETRY,"coverture of embroidered words, however pretty and fantastic; as has"
514,POETRY,"been excellently said by Shelley: ""A poem _is the very image of life"
515,POETRY,expressed in its external truth_. There is this difference between a
516,POETRY,"story and a poem, that a story is a catalogue of detached facts, which"
517,POETRY,"have no other connection than time, place, circumstance, cause and"
518,POETRY,effect; the other is the erection of actions according to the
519,POETRY,"unchangeable forms of human nature, as existing in the mind of the"
520,POETRY,"Creator, which is itself the image of all other minds."" Let us enforce"
521,POETRY,this account of the true idealisation by a verse or two of our old
522,POETRY,friend Sir John Davies (quoted by Coleridge in his _Biographia
523,POETRY,"Literaria_). ""What an unworldly mass of impressions the mind would be,"""
524,POETRY,"says Sir John in effect, ""did not the soul come to the rescue and reduce"
525,POETRY,"these crowding bodies by 'sublimation strange.'""--"
526,POETRY,
527,POETRY,"_From their gross Matter she abstracts the Forms,"
528,POETRY,"And draws a kind of Quintessence from things,"
529,POETRY,Which to her proper nature she transforms
530,POETRY,To bear them light on her celestial wings.
531,POETRY,This doth She when from things particular
532,POETRY,She doth abstract the Universal kinds...._
533,POETRY,
534,POETRY,But it is time to descend from these heights (such as they are) of
535,POETRY,"philosophising, and illustrate the difference between true and false"
536,POETRY,"""idealising"" in Poetry by concrete example: and no two better examples"
537,POETRY,"occur to me, for drawing this contrast, than Webster's _Duchess of"
538,POETRY,Malfy_ and Shakespeare's _Macbeth_. Each of these plays excites horror
539,POETRY,and is calculated to excite horror; both have outlived three hundred
540,POETRY,"years, there or thereabouts; both may be taken as having established an"
541,POETRY,"indefinitely long lease on men's admiration--but to any critical mind,"
542,POETRY,"how different an admiration! Webster is an expert, a _virtuoso_ in"
543,POETRY,"horrifics; in flesh-creeping effects lies his skill; and, indulging that"
544,POETRY,"skill, he not only paints the lily, but repaints it and daubs it yet a"
545,POETRY,third time. There is no reason on earth--she has offended against no
546,POETRY,moral law on earth or in the heavens--that could possibly condemn the
547,POETRY,Duchess to the hellish tortures she is made to endure. At the worst she
548,POETRY,has married a man beneath her in station. To punish her in Webster's
549,POETRY,"extravagant fashion every other character, with the whole story of the"
550,POETRY,"play, has to be dehumanised. To me--as I penetrate the Fourth Act--the"
551,POETRY,"whole business becomes ludicrous: not sanely comic, or even quite sanely"
552,POETRY,"absurd: but bizarre, and ridiculously bizarre at that. It has no ""idea"""
553,POETRY,"at all, no relation to the Universal in the shape of any moral order,"
554,POETRY,"""law,"" fate, doom, destiny. It is just a box of tricks, of raw heads and"
555,POETRY,"bloody bones, left with the lid open. That is false ""idealising"";"
556,POETRY,"Webster choosing his effect and ""improving"" it for all he was"
557,POETRY,worth--which (let it be added) was a great deal.

561,POETRY,"Turn from _The Duchess of Malfy_ to _Macbeth_, and you find an English"
562,POETRY,"poet as sensitive of fate, doom, destiny, ""law,"" the moral order, as"
563,POETRY,"ever was Aeschylus; nay, interpreting it perhaps more effectively than"
564,POETRY,ever did Aeschylus. In the First Act we see it suggested to Macbeth by
565,POETRY,witchcraft (which is the personified foe of moral order) that he can
566,POETRY,"achieve an ambition by an unlawful path, the ambition itself being"
567,POETRY,suggested along with the way to it and growing as the way opens. We see
568,POETRY,"them both communicated to a feminine mind, narrower, more intent and"
569,POETRY,"practical; because narrower, because more intent and practical, for the"
570,POETRY,"moment more courageous. (It was Eve that the Serpent, wily enough,"
571,POETRY,selected to tempt.) Both Macbeth and his lady move to the deed under a
572,POETRY,law which--for a while--has usurped the true moral order and reversed
573,POETRY,"it, he not without misgivings: the spectators all the while knowing the"
574,POETRY,"true order, yet held silent, watching the event. Outside the castle an"
575,POETRY,"owl hoots as Duncan is slain. The guilty man and woman creep back,"
576,POETRY,whispering; and thereupon--what happens? A knocking on the door--a
577,POETRY,knocking followed by the growls of a drowsy if not drunken porter:
578,POETRY,"""Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell-gate, he should"

593,POETRY,law of the great moral powers ordering the Universe (Man along with it)
594,POETRY,"and are overtaken in that trespass and punished, Shakespeare"
595,POETRY,"disencumbers it of all that is trivial, irrelevant, non-essential. He"
596,POETRY,takes the wickedest crime of which man can be guilty; not a mere naked
597,POETRY,"murder, nor even a murder for profit, but the murder of a king by his"
598,POETRY,"sworn soldier, of a guest by his host, of a sleeping guest by the hand"
599,POETRY,on which he has just bestowed a diamond. Can criminality be laid barer?
600,POETRY,He illustrates it again in two persons lifted above the common station;
601,POETRY,and he does this not (as I think) for the practical reason for which
602,POETRY,Aristotle seems to commend it to tragic writers--that the disasters of
603,POETRY,great persons are more striking than those of the small fry of
604,POETRY,"mankind--that, as the height is, so will be the fall--or not for that"
605,POETRY,"reason alone; but, still in the process of ""idealising,"" because such"
606,POETRY,"persons, exalted above the obscuring petty cares of life, may reasonably"
607,POETRY,"be expected to see the Universe with a clearer vision than ours, to have"
608,POETRY,more delicate ears for its harmonies. Who but a King should know most
609,POETRY,concerning moral law? Why is he with our consent lifted up so that he
610,POETRY,"may hear the divine commandments better than we, and dictate them down"
611,POETRY,"to us? He is greater, but yet--and this is the point--_a man like"
612,POETRY,ourselves_ ([Greek: _omoios_]). He cannot for purposes of tragedy be
613,POETRY,"wholly good: for not only is this extremely rare in real life, and"
614,POETRY,"almost inconceivable, but the ruin of a wholly good man would merely"
615,POETRY,"shock, without teaching us anything. The disaster of a tragic figure"
616,POETRY,"must come, and be seen to come, through some fault--or, at least, some"
617,POETRY,"mistake--of his own. But again he must not be wholly bad, for the"
618,POETRY,disasters of the wholly bad do not affect us save with disgust. Such
619,POETRY,"men, we know, are not _like ourselves_. What happens to them may serve"
620,POETRY,for _The Police News_. Tragedy does not deal with the worthless. How
621,POETRY,"then are Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, beings like ourselves, to fall into"
622,POETRY,crime so heinous? Again Shakespeare strips the Idea bare: their trespass
623,POETRY,"comes through ambition, ""last infirmity of noble minds,"" under the"
624,POETRY,"blinding persuasion of witchcraft, which (an actual belief in"
625,POETRY,"Shakespeare's time) is a direct negation of the moral law, and puts"
626,POETRY,Satan in place of God.

631,POETRY,"this tremendous theme, another attempt on it was being meditated, and by"
632,POETRY,the man whom the most of us rank next after Shakespeare in the hierarchy
633,POETRY,"of English poets. Among the treasures in the library at Trinity College,"
634,POETRY,"Cambridge, lies a manuscript, the hand-writing undoubtedly Milton's,"
635,POETRY,containing a list compiled by him of promising subjects for the great
636,POETRY,"poem for which, between his leaving the University and the outbreak of"
637,POETRY,"the Civil War, all his life was a deliberate preparation. The list is"
638,POETRY,"long; the subjects proposed run to no fewer than ninety-nine. Of these,"
639,POETRY,fifty-three are derived from Old Testament history (with a recurring
640,POETRY,"inclination for the theme of _Paradise Lost_), eight from the New"
641,POETRY,Testament; thirty-three from the history of Britain (with a leaning
642,POETRY,towards the Arthurian legend); while five of them are legendary tales of
643,POETRY,"Scotland or North Britain, the last being headed ""Macbeth. Beginning at"
644,POETRY,the arrival of Malcolm at Macduff. The matter of Duncan may be expressed
645,POETRY,"by the arrival of his ghost."" Now that Milton (an adorer of"
646,POETRY,"Shakespeare's genius, as everyone knows) should have taken so deep an"
647,POETRY,impression from the play that its theme possessed him and he longed to
648,POETRY,"transfer it to _Epic_, is credible enough. That he, with his classical"
649,POETRY,"bent, should choose to attempt in Drama an improvement upon the most"
650,POETRY,"""classical"" of all Shakespeare's tragedies seems to me scarcely"
651,POETRY,"credible. But if the credibility of this be granted, then I can only"
652,POETRY,conceive Milton's designing to improve the play by making it yet more
653,POETRY,"""classical,"" _i.e._ by writing it (after the fashion he followed in"
654,POETRY,_Samson Agonistes_) closely upon the model of Athenian Tragedy.

656,POETRY,For my part I always consider Milton's _Macbeth_ the most fascinating
657,POETRY,"poem--certainly, if play it were, the most fascinating play--ever"
658,POETRY,unwritten. But of this any man may be sure; that (since they were both
659,POETRY,"great poets) one made, as the other would have made, a story of far more"
660,POETRY,value to us than Shakespeare or Milton or any man before or after could
661,POETRY,"have made by a strict biography of Macbeth, the man as he lived. For any"
662,POETRY,such biography would clog the lesson for us with details which were more
663,POETRY,the less irrelevant because they really happened. Here I must quote
664,POETRY,"Aristotle again, and for the last time in this little book: but no"
665,POETRY,sentences in his treatise hold a deeper import than these:--
666,POETRY,
667,POETRY,"""It is not the function of the Poet to relate what has happened, but"
668,POETRY,what may happen of likelihood or must happen of necessity. The Poet and
669,POETRY,the Historian are not different because one writes in verse and the
670,POETRY,"other in prose. Turn what Herodotus tells into verse, and none the less"
671,POETRY,it will be a sort of history; the metre makes no difference. The real
672,POETRY,"difference lies in the Historian's telling what has happened, the Poet's"
673,POETRY,"telling what may happen. _Thus Poetry is a more philosophical thing, and"
674,POETRY,"a more serious, than History: for Poetry tells of the Universal, History"
675,POETRY,of the Particular_. Now the business of the Universal is to tell us how
676,POETRY,it will fall to such and such a person to speak or act in such or such
677,POETRY,circumstances according to likelihood or necessity: and it is at this
678,POETRY,that Poetry aims in giving characters names of its own: whereas the

707,POETRY,without seeing? Say it be the shortest of rambles on an afternoon in
708,POETRY,early November. The light fades early: but before he reaches home in the
709,POETRY,"dark, how many of the myriad falling leaves has he counted?--a dozen at"
710,POETRY,"most. Of the myriad leaves changing colour does he preserve, unless by"
711,POETRY,"chance, the separate image of one? Rather from the mass over which his"
712,POETRY,"eyes have travelled he has abstracted an ""idea"" of autumnal"
713,POETRY,"colouring--yellow, red, brown--and with that he carries home a"
714,POETRY,"sentimental, perhaps even a profound, sense of the falling leaf, the"
715,POETRY,"falling close of the year. So--and just so, save more deftly--the Poet"
716,POETRY,abstracts:--
717,POETRY,
718,POETRY,_Where is the prime of Summer--the green prime--
719,POETRY,"The many, many leaves all twinkling?--Three"
720,POETRY,On the moss'd elm; three on the naked lime
721,POETRY,Trembling; and one upon the old oak tree!_
722,POETRY,
723,POETRY,"(As a matter of fact, oak leaves are singularly tenacious, and the"
724,POETRY,"autumnal oak will show a thousand for the elm's one. Hood, being a"
725,POETRY,"Cockney, took his seven leaves at random. But what does it matter? He"
726,POETRY,"was a poet, and seven leaves sufficed him to convey the idea.)"
727,POETRY,
728,POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
729,POETRY,
730,POETRY,"Nor does our Poet, unless he be a charlatan, pretend to bring home some"
731,POETRY,hieratic message above the understanding of his fellows: for he is an
732,POETRY,"interpreter, and the interpreter's success depends upon hitting his"
733,POETRY,"hearer's intelligence. Failing that, he misses everything and is null."
734,POETRY,"To put it in another way--at the base of all Literature, of all Poetry,"
735,POETRY,"as of all Theology, stands one rock: _the very highest Universe Truth is"
736,POETRY,something so absolutely simple that a child can understand it._ This is
737,POETRY,what Emerson means when he tells us that the great writers never _seem
738,POETRY,to condescend_; that yonder slip of a boy who has carried off
739,POETRY,"Shakespeare to the window-seat, can feel with King Harry or Hamlet or"
740,POETRY,"Coriolanus, with Rosalind or Desdemona or Miranda. For the moment he"
741,POETRY,"_is_ any given one of these, because any human soul contains them all."
742,POETRY,And some such thought we must believe to have been in Our Lord's mind
743,POETRY,"when He said, ""I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that"
744,POETRY,"Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and hast"
745,POETRY,"revealed them unto babes."" For as the Universe is one, so the individual"
746,POETRY,"human souls that apprehend it have no varying values intrinsically, but"
747,POETRY,"one equal value. They differ only in power to apprehend, and this may be"
748,POETRY,more easily hindered than helped by the conceit begotten of finite
749,POETRY,knowledge. I would even dare to quote of this Universal Truth the words
750,POETRY,I once hardily put into the mouth of John Wesley concerning divine Love:
751,POETRY,"""I see now that if God's love reaches up to every star and down to every"
752,POETRY,"poor soul on Earth, it must be something vastly simple, so simple that"
753,POETRY,all dwellers on earth may be assured of it--as all who have eyes may be
754,POETRY,assured of the planet shining yonder at the end of the street--and so
755,POETRY,"vast that all bargaining is below it, and they may inherit it without"
756,POETRY,"considering their deserts."" The message, then, which one Poet brings"
757,POETRY,"home, is no esoteric one: as Johnson said of Gray's _Elegy_, ""it abounds"
758,POETRY,"with images which find a mirror in every mind, and with sentiments to"
759,POETRY,"which every bosom returns an echo."" It exalts us through the best in us,"
760,POETRY,"by telling it, not as anything new or strange, _but so as we recognise"
761,POETRY,it_.
762,POETRY,
763,POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
764,POETRY,
765,POETRY,"And here let us dwell a moment on Johnson's phrase, ""to which every"
766,POETRY,"bosom returns an echo"": for it recalls us to a point, which we noted"
767,POETRY,"indeed on p. 22, but have left (I fear) somewhat under-emphasised--the"
768,POETRY,"emotion that enters into poetical truth, which only by the help of"
769,POETRY,"emotion is apprehended; as through emotion it is conveyed, and to an"
770,POETRY,emotional understanding in the hearer addresses its appeal. For the
771,POETRY,"desire of man's soul after the Universal, to be in harmony with it, is"
772,POETRY,"(as a matter of fact, and when all pulpit eloquence has been"
773,POETRY,discounted) something more than a mere intellectual attraction: a
774,POETRY,[Greek: _storghê_] rather; a yearning felt in its veins to know its
775,POETRY,"fatherhood. Saint Paul goes farther and assures us that ""the earnest"
776,POETRY,"expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation,"" so that ""the"
777,POETRY,"whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now."" ""And"
778,POETRY,"not only they,"" he goes on, ""but ourselves also"": while the pagan poet"
779,POETRY,has tears that reach the heart of the transitory show: _Sunt lacrimæ
780,POETRY,"rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt_--""Tears are for Life, mortal things"
781,POETRY,"pierce the soul."""
782,POETRY,
783,POETRY,And why not? For the complete man--_totus homo_--has feelings as well as
784,POETRY,"reason, and should have both active, in fine training, to realise the"
785,POETRY,"best of him. Shelley obviously meant this when he defined Poetry as ""the"
786,POETRY,"record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest and best minds."""
787,POETRY,He did not mean that they are happy only in the sense of being
788,POETRY,"""fortunate,"" _felices_, in such moments, but that they were happy in the"
789,POETRY,"sense of being ""blessed,"" _beati_; and this feeling of blessedness they"
790,POETRY,"communicate. ""We are aware,"" he goes on, ""of evanescent visitations of"
791,POETRY,"thought and feeling sometimes associated with place or person, sometimes"
792,POETRY,"requiring our own mind alone, and always arising unforeseen and"
793,POETRY,"departing unbidden, but elevating _and delightful_ beyond all expression"
794,POETRY,"... so that even in the desire and the regret they leave, _there cannot"
795,POETRY,"but be pleasure_, participating as it does in the nature of its object."
796,POETRY,It is as it were the interpenetration of a divine nature through our
797,POETRY,"own, ... and the state of mind produced is at war with every base"
798,POETRY,"desire. The _enthusiasm_ of virtue, love, patriotism, and friendship is"
799,POETRY,"essentially linked with such emotions; and whilst they last, self"
800,POETRY,"appears as what it is--an atom in the universe."" Every word italicised"
801,POETRY,above by me carries Shelley's witness that Poetry and joyous emotion are
802,POETRY,"inseparable. ""Poetry,"" he winds up, ""redeems from decay the visitations"
803,POETRY,"of the Divinity in Man."" How can we dissociate from joy the news of such"
804,POETRY,visitations either on the lips that carry or in the ears that receive?
805,POETRY,
806,POETRY,"Yet, as has been hinted, the very simplicity of it puzzles the ordinary"
807,POETRY,"man, and not only puzzles the philosopher but exasperates him. It annoys"
808,POETRY,"the philosopher, first, that the poet apparently takes so little"
809,POETRY,"trouble. (As a fact he takes endless trouble; but, to be sure, he saves"
810,POETRY,an immense deal by going the right way to work.) All knowledge is
811,POETRY,"notoriously painful (that is to say, to philosophers). Moreover, the"
812,POETRY,fellow mixes it up with emotion (an integral part of man which
813,POETRY,"philosophy ignores, and stultifies itself, as a rule, by ignoring). He"
814,POETRY,"is one with the Oracles, a suspected tribe. He idles like an Oracle,"
815,POETRY,"attending on inspiration, and when he has received the alleged afflatus,"
816,POETRY,the fellow--so different from us--is neither to hold nor to bind. The
817,POETRY,"easiest way with him seems to be a pitying contempt. ""For all good"
818,POETRY,"poets,"" says Socrates sagely in the Ion, ""epic as well as lyric, compose"
819,POETRY,"their lovely strains, not by art, but because they are inspired and"
820,POETRY,"possessed. And as the Corybantian dances are not quite 'rational,' so"
821,POETRY,"the lyric poets are, so to speak, not quite '_all there_.' ... They tell"
822,POETRY,"us,"" he goes on condescendingly, ""that they bring songs from honeyed"
823,POETRY,"fountains, culling them from the gardens and dells of the Muses; that,"
824,POETRY,"like the bees, they wing from one flower to another. Yes of a truth: the"
825,POETRY,"Poet is a light and a winged and a holy thing, without invention in him"
826,POETRY,"until he is inspired and out of his senses, and out of his own wit;"
827,POETRY,"until he has attained to this he is but a feeble thing, unable to utter"
828,POETRY,"his oracles."" I can imagine all this reported to Homer in the Shades and"
829,POETRY,"Homer answering with a smile: ""Well, and who in the world is denying it?"
830,POETRY,"I certainly did not, while I lived and sang upon earth. Nay, I never"
831,POETRY,"even sang, but invited the Muse to sing to me and through me. [Greek:"
832,POETRY,"_Mênin haeide theha ... Handra moi hennepe, Moysa_.]--Surely the dear"
833,POETRY,fellow might remember the first line of my immortal works! And if he
834,POETRY,"does remember, and is only bringing it up against me that in the"
835,POETRY,"intervals of doing my work in life I was a feeble fellow, go back and"
836,POETRY,"tell him that it is likely enough, yet I fail to see how it can be any"
837,POETRY,"business of his, since it was only my work that I ever asked for"
838,POETRY,recognition. They say that I used to go about begging a dinner on the
839,POETRY,"strength of it. Did I?... I cannot remember. Anyhow, that nuisance is"
840,POETRY,"over sometime ago, and _his_ kitchen is safe!"""
841,POETRY,
842,POETRY,"To you, who have followed the argument of this little book, the theory"
843,POETRY,"of poetic ""inspiration"" will be intelligible enough. It earned a living"
844,POETRY,"in its day and, if revived in ours, might happily supersede much modern"
845,POETRY,chatter about art and technique. For it contains much truth:--
846,POETRY,
847,POETRY,_When the flicker of London sun falls faint on the Club-room's green
848,POETRY,"and gold,"
849,POETRY,The sons of Adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould--
850,POETRY,"They scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves, and the ink"
851,POETRY,"and the anguish start,"
852,POETRY,"For the Devil mutters behind the leaves, ""It's pretty, but is it Art?""_"
853,POETRY,
854,POETRY,The philosophers did poetry no great harm by being angry with it as an
855,POETRY,"""inspired"" thing: for that, in a measure, it happens to be. They did it"
856,POETRY,far more harm when they took it seriously and made it out to be a form
857,POETRY,of _teaching_. For by the nature of things there happens to be something
858,POETRY,of the pedant in every philosopher and the incurable propensity of the
859,POETRY,pedant is to remove everything--but Literature especially--out of the
860,POETRY,category to which it belongs and consider it in another with which it
861,POETRY,has but a remote concern. (Thus a man will talk of Chaucer as though his
862,POETRY,inflexions were the most important thing about him.) Now to acclaim
863,POETRY,"Homer as a great teacher, and use him in the schools, was right enough"
864,POETRY,"so long as the Athenians remembered (and is right enough for us, so long"
865,POETRY,"as we remember) _how_ he teaches us, or rather _educates_. What we have"
866,POETRY,described the Poet as doing for men--drawing forth the inner harmonies
867,POETRY,of the soul and attuning them to the Universal--is _educative_ in the
868,POETRY,"truest sense as in the highest degree. So long as we remember this, the"
869,POETRY,old dispute whether the aim of Poetry be to teach or to delight is seen
870,POETRY,"to be futile: for she does both, and she does the one by means of the"
871,POETRY,"other. On the other hand, you cannot leave a delicate instrument such as"
872,POETRY,Poetry lying within reach of the professional teacher; he will
873,POETRY,"certainly, at any risk of marring or mutilating, seize on it and use it"
874,POETRY,"as a hammer to knock things into heads; if rebuked for this, plaintively"
875,POETRY,"remonstrating, ""But I thought you told me it was useful to teach with!"""
876,POETRY,"(So Gideon taught the men of Succoth.) And therefore, we need not be"
877,POETRY,"astonished: coming dawn to Strabo, to find him asserting that ""the"
878,POETRY,"ancients held poetry to be a kind of elementary philosophy, introducing"
879,POETRY,"us from childhood to life and pleasureably instructing us in character,"
880,POETRY,"behaviour and action."" The Greeks, he tells us, chose poetry for their"
881,POETRY,children's first lessons. Surely (he argues) they never did that for the
882,POETRY,"sake of sweetly influencing the soul, but rather for the correction of"
883,POETRY,"morals! Strabo's mental attitude is absurd, of course, and preposterous:"
884,POETRY,for this same influencing of the soul--[Greek: _phychagôghia_] (a
885,POETRY,"beautiful word)--is, as we have seen, Poetry's main business: but the"
886,POETRY,mischief of the notion did not end with making the schooldays of
887,POETRY,"children unhappy: it took hold of the poets themselves, and by turning"
888,POETRY,them into prigs dried up the children's well of consolation. The Fathers
889,POETRY,"of the Church lent a hand too, and a vigorous one; and for centuries the"
890,POETRY,face of the Muse was sicklied o'er with a pale determination to combine
891,POETRY,amusement with instruction. Even our noble Sidney allowed his modesty to
892,POETRY,"be overawed by the pedantic tradition, though as a man of the world he"
893,POETRY,"tactfully gave it the slip. ""For suppose it be granted,"" he says, ""(that"
894,POETRY,which I suppose with great reason may be denied) that the Philosopher in
895,POETRY,respect of his methodical proceeding doth teach more perfectly than the
896,POETRY,Poet: yet do I thinke that no man is so much _Philosophus_ as to compare
897,POETRY,"the Philosopher, in _mooving_, with the Poet. And that mooving is of a"
898,POETRY,"higher degree than teaching, it may by this appeare: that it is welnigh"
899,POETRY,"the cause and the effect of teaching. For who will be taught, if hee bee"
900,POETRY,"not mooved with desire to be taught?"" Then, after a page devoted to"
901,POETRY,"showing ""which constant desire whosoever hath in him hath already past"
902,POETRY,"halfe the hardness of the way,"" Sidney goes on: ""Now therein of all"
903,POETRY,"Sciences (I speak still of human, and according to the human conceit) is"
904,POETRY,"our Poet the Monarch. For he dooth not only show the way, but giveth so"
905,POETRY,"sweete a prospect into the way, as will intice any man to enter into it."
906,POETRY,"Nay he dooth as if your journey should lye through a fayre Vineyard, at"
907,POETRY,"the first give you a cluster of Grapes, that full of that taste you may"
908,POETRY,"long to passe further. He beginneth not with obscure definitions, which"
909,POETRY,must blur the margent with interpretations and load the memory with
910,POETRY,doubtfulnesse: but hee commeth to you with words set in delightful
911,POETRY,"proportion, either accompanied with, or prepared for, the"
912,POETRY,well-inchaunting skill of Musicke; and with a tale forsooth he commeth
913,POETRY,unto you: with a tale which holdeth children from play and old men from
914,POETRY,"the chimney-corner."""
915,POETRY,
916,POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
917,POETRY,
918,POETRY,"""And with a tale, forsooth, he commeth to you.""--For having stripped"
919,POETRY,"the Idea bare, he has to reclothe it again and in such shape as will"
920,POETRY,strike forcibly on his hearer's senses. A while back we broke off midway
921,POETRY,in a stanza of Sir John Davies. Let us here complete it. There are two
922,POETRY,versions. As first Davies wrote:--
923,POETRY,
924,POETRY,"_This doth She when from things particular,"
925,POETRY,"She doth abstract the Universal kinds,"
926,POETRY,"Which bodiless and immaterial are,"
927,POETRY,And can be lodged but only in our minds._
928,POETRY,
929,POETRY,--the last two lines of which are weak and unnecessary. Revising the
930,POETRY,"stanza, he wrote:--"
931,POETRY,
932,POETRY,"_This does She, when from individual states"
933,POETRY,"She doth abstract the Universal kinds,"
934,POETRY,Which then reclothed in divers names and fates
935,POETRY,"Steal access through our senses to our minds,_"
936,POETRY,
937,POETRY,"--which exactly describes the whole process. Having laid bare the Idea,"
938,POETRY,"our Poet, turning from analysis to synthesis, proceeds to reclothe it in"
939,POETRY,"new particulars of his own inventing, carefully chosen that they may"
940,POETRY,strike home hardest upon the hearer's perceptions. Now that which
941,POETRY,strikes home hardest on a man is a tale which he can grasp by the
942,POETRY,concretest images conveyed in the concretest language. '_Labor improbus
943,POETRY,omnia vincit_' tells him not half so much as a tale of the labours of
944,POETRY,Hercules; so he will learn more of patience from Job or Griselda; more
945,POETRY,of chivalrous courage from Hector or Roland or Launcelot or the tale of
946,POETRY,Palamon and Arcite; more of patriotism from the figures in
947,POETRY,"history--Leonidas, Horatius, Regulus, Joan of Arc, William Tell,"
948,POETRY,"Garibaldi, Gordon--that have translated the Idea back into their own"
949,POETRY,"lives with the noblest simplicity, so that we say of them that they are"
950,POETRY,"""epical figures"" or ""figures worthy of romance,"" thereby paying them the"
951,POETRY,highest compliment in our power: yes and more of Christian simplicity
952,POETRY,"from my Uncle Toby, Colonel Newcome, even Mr. Pickwick; than from a"
953,POETRY,hundred copybook maxims concerning these virtues: all these figures
954,POETRY,"indeed illustrating the tritest copybook maxim of all--that ""Example"
955,POETRY,"is better than Precept."" Thus Charles Lamb praises the Plays of"
956,POETRY,"Shakespeare as ""enrichers of the fancy, strengtheners of virtue, a"
957,POETRY,"withdrawing from all selfish and mercenary thoughts, a lesson of all"
958,POETRY,"sweet and honourable thoughts and actions, to teach courtesy, benignity,"
959,POETRY,"generosity, humanity: for,"" say he, ""of _examples_, teaching those"
960,POETRY,"virtues, his pages are full."""
961,POETRY,
962,POETRY,*       *       *       *       *
963,POETRY,
964,POETRY,"The Poet then, having seized on the Idea and purged it of what is"
965,POETRY,"trivial or accidental, reclothes it in a concrete dress and so"
966,POETRY,represents it to us. And you will generally remark in the very greatest
967,POETRY,poets that not only are the images they represent to us extraordinarily
968,POETRY,"definite and concrete and therefore vivid--as Dante, for example, will"
969,POETRY,describe a Scene in Hell or in Paradise with as much particularity as
970,POETRY,though he were writing a newspaper report; but this concreteness of
971,POETRY,vision translates itself into a remarkable concreteness of speech. I
972,POETRY,"suppose there was never a more concrete writer than Shakespeare, and his"
973,POETRY,practice of translating all his idea into things which you can touch or
974,POETRY,"see grew steadily stronger throughout his career, so that any competent"
975,POETRY,critic can in a moment distinguish his later writing from his earlier by
976,POETRY,"its compression of images in words, its forcible concretion of the"
977,POETRY,"various ""parts of speech,"" its masterful _corvée_ of nouns substantive"
978,POETRY,"to do the work of verbs, and so on. Even in very early work such as"
979,POETRY,"_Venus and Adonis_ we cannot but note this gift of vision, how quick and"
980,POETRY,particular it is....
981,POETRY,
982,POETRY,"_Upon this promise did he raise his chin,"
983,POETRY,"Like a dive-dipper, peering through a wave,"
984,POETRY,"Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in...._"
985,POETRY,
986,POETRY,But in his later plays--so fast the images teem--he has to reach out
987,POETRY,"among nouns, verbs, adverbs, with both strong hands, grasping what comes"
988,POETRY,and packing it ere it can protest. Take for example:--
989,POETRY,
990,POETRY,_Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care._
991,POETRY,
992,POETRY,Or--
993,POETRY,
994,POETRY,"_The multitudinous sea incarnadine,"
995,POETRY,Making the green one red._
996,POETRY,
997,POETRY,Or--
998,POETRY,
999,POETRY,_In the dark backward and abysm of time._
1000,POETRY,
1001,POETRY,Or this from Lear:--
1002,POETRY,
1003,POETRY,"_My face I'll grime with filth,"
1004,POETRY,"Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots"
1005,POETRY,And with presented nakedness outface
1006,POETRY,The winds and persecutions of the sky._
1007,POETRY,
1008,POETRY,"Or (for vividness) this, from _Antony and Cleopatra_, when Cleopatra"
1009,POETRY,cries out and faints over Antony's body:--
1010,POETRY,
1011,POETRY,"_O! withered is the garland of the war,"
1012,POETRY,The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
1013,POETRY,"Are level now with men; the odds is gone,"
1014,POETRY,And there is nothing left remarkable
1015,POETRY,Beneath the visiting moon ..._
1016,POETRY,
1017,POETRY,"""Madam! Madam!"" ""Royal Egypt!"" ""Empress!"" cry the waiting-maids as she"
1018,POETRY,swoons. She revives and rebukes them:--
1019,POETRY,
1020,POETRY,"_No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded"
1021,POETRY,By such poor passion as the maid that milks
1022,POETRY,And does the meanest chares. It were for me
1023,POETRY,To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
1024,POETRY,To tell them that this world did equal theirs
1025,POETRY,Till they had stolen my jewel._
1026,POETRY,
1027,POETRY,"When a poet can, as Shakespeare does here, seize upon a Universal truth"
1028,POETRY,"and lay it bare; when, apprehending _passion_ in this instance, he can"
1029,POETRY,"show it naked, the master of gods and levelling queens with"
1030,POETRY,milkmaids--_totus est in armis idem quando nudus est Amor;_ when he can
1031,POETRY,"reclothe it in the sensuous body of Cleopatra, ""Royal Egypt,"" and,"
1032,POETRY,"rending the robe over that bosom, reveal the Idea again in a wound so"
1033,POETRY,"vividly that almost we see the nature of woman spirting, like brood,"
1034,POETRY,against the heaven it defies; then we who have followed the Poet's
1035,POETRY,"ascending claims arrive at his last and highest, yet at one which has"
1036,POETRY,"lain implicit all along in his title. He is a Poet--a ""Maker."" By that"
1037,POETRY,"name, ""Maker,"" he used to be known in English, and he deserves no lesser"
1038,POETRY,one.

1052,POETRY,"yearly; but _solus rex, aut poeta, non quotannis nascitur_""--these two"
1053,POETRY,"only, a King and a Poet, are not born every year. The Poet ""makes""--that"
1054,POETRY,"is to say, creates--which is a part of the divine function; and he"
