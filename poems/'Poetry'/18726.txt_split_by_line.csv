204,I,"Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour"
205,I,"of winter had passed out of sight,"
206,I,The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that
207,I,fulfil us in sleep with delight;
208,I,The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and
209,I,branches that glittered and swayed
210,I,Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that
211,I,outlightens all flowers till it fade
212,I,"That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night"
213,I,"than the day, nor the day than the night,"
214,I,Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had
215,I,"the madness and might in thee made,"
216,I,"March, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that"
217,I,enkindle the season they smite.

222,II,And now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and
223,II,"ravin and spoil of the snow,"
224,II,"And the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the"
225,II,"tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low,"
226,II,"How should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the"
227,II,year that exults to be born
228,II,So strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose
229,II,laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn?
230,II,"Thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy"
231,II,forehead is molten: thy lips are aglow
232,II,"As a lover's that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment"
233,II,"and tresses yet wasted and torn,"
234,II,Takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel
235,II,through her spirit the sense of thee flow.

240,III,"Fain, fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the"
241,III,"sun have dispelled and consumed,"
242,III,Those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous
243,III,burden the branches implumed
244,III,"Hung heavily, curved as a half-bent bow, and fledged not as birds"
245,III,"are, but petalled as flowers,"
246,III,"Each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved, or a"
247,III,"fountain that shines as it showers,"
248,III,"But fixed as a fountain is fixed not, and wrought not to last till"
249,III,"by time or by tempest entombed,"
250,III,As a pinnacle carven and gilded of men: for the date of its doom is
251,III,"no more than an hour's,"
252,III,One hour of the sun's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the
253,III,snow-flowers that froze as they bloomed.

258,IV,"As the sunshine quenches the snowshine; as April subdues thee, and"
259,IV,yields up his kingdom to May;
260,IV,So time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes
261,IV,"in passion away,"
262,IV,And leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with
263,IV,"tears or thanksgivings; but thou,"
264,IV,"Bright god that art gone from us, maddest and gladdest of months,"
265,IV,to what goal hast thou gone from us now?
266,IV,"For somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens, the"
267,IV,"beat of thy wings that play,"
268,IV,"Must flame as a fire through the world, and the heavens that we"
269,IV,know not rejoice in thee: surely thy brow
270,IV,"Hath lost not its radiance of empire, thy spirit the joy that"
271,IV,impelled it on quest as for prey.

833,III,"grace was upon them as night,"
834,III,And faith as the blackness of darkness: the fume of their balefires
835,III,"was fair in his sight,"
836,III,The reek of them sweet as a savour of myrrh in his nostrils: the
837,III,"world that he made,"
838,III,"Theirs was it by gift of his servants: the wind, if they spake in"
839,III,"his name, was afraid,"
840,III,"And the sun was a shadow before it, the stars were astonished with"
841,III,fear of it: fire
842,III,"Went up to them, fed with men living, and lit of men's hands for a"
843,III,shrine or a pyre;
844,III,"And the east and the west wind scattered their ashes abroad, that"
845,III,his name should be blest

875,II,Were swept from her waves like shadows that pass with the clouds

890,III,"All filled full of the war, full-fraught with battle and charged"
891,III,with bale;
892,III,Then store-ships weighted with cannon; and all were an hundred and

894,III,The measureless menace of darkness anhungered with hope to prevail
895,III,"upon light,"
896,III,"The shadow of death made substance, the present and visible spirit"

1140,I,"Whose banners on all winds fly,"
1141,I,"Soul-stricken, he saith, by the shadow of death, holds off him, and"

1143,I,
1144,I,And the wind and the dawn together

1146,I,And fain of the wild glad weather
1147,I,"As famine is fain of feast,"
1148,I,"And fain of the fight, forth sweeps in its might the host of the"
1149,I,Lord's high priest.
1150,I,
1151,I,And lightly before the breeze

1162,I,"Leaps up as the foe's heart leaps, and glows with lustrous rapture"
1163,I,of light.
1164,I,
1165,I,And stinted of gear for battle
1166,I,"The ships of the sea's folk lie,"
1167,I,"Unwarlike, herded as cattle,"
1168,I,Six miles from the foeman's eye
1169,I,"That fastens as flame on the sight of them tame and offenceless,"

1171,I,

1179,I,"And the windless weather is kindly,"
1180,I,And comforts the host in these;
1181,I,"And their hearts are uplift in them blindly,"
1182,I,And blindly they boast at ease
1183,I,"That the next day's fight shall exalt them, and smite with"
1184,I,destruction the lords of the seas.

1187,II,

1189,II,"And lightly the dawn draws nigh,"
1190,II,The dawn of the doom of the battle
1191,II,When these shall falter and fly;
1192,II,No day more great in the roll of fate filled ever with fire the
1193,II,sky.
1194,II,
1195,II,"To fightward they go as to feastward,"
1196,II,And the tempest of ships that drive
1197,II,"Sets eastward ever and eastward,"
1198,II,Till closer they strain and strive;
1199,II,And the shots that rain on the hulls of Spain are as thunders afire
1200,II,and alive.
1201,II,
1202,II,And about them the blithe sea smiles
1203,II,And flashes to windward and lee
1204,II,Round capes and headlands and isles
1205,II,That heed not if war there be;
1206,II,"Round Sark, round Wight, green jewels of light in the ring of the"
1207,II,golden sea.
1208,II,
1209,II,But the men that within them abide
1210,II,Are stout of spirit and stark
1211,II,"As rocks that repel the tide,"
1212,II,As day that repels the dark;
1213,II,And the light bequeathed from their swords unsheathed shines lineal
1214,II,on Wight and on Sark.
1215,II,
1216,II,"And eastward the storm sets ever,"
1217,II,The storm of the sails that strain
1218,II,And follow and close and sever
1219,II,And lose and return and gain;
1220,II,And English thunder divides in sunder the holds of the ships of
1221,II,Spain.
1222,II,
1223,II,"Southward to Calais, appalled"
1224,II,"And astonished, the vast fleet veers;"
1225,II,"And the skies are shrouded and palled,"
1226,II,But the moonless midnight hears
1227,II,And sees how swift on them drive and drift strange flames that the
1228,II,darkness fears.
1229,II,
1230,II,"They fly through the night from shoreward,"
1231,II,"Heart-stricken till morning break,"
1232,II,And ever to scourge them forward
1233,II,"Drives down on them England's Drake,"
1234,II,"And hurls them in as they hurtle and spin and stagger, with storm"
1235,II,to wake.

1238,VI,VI
1239,VI,
1240,I,I

1244,I,"With the shallows of Flanders ahead, with destruction and havoc"
1245,I,"at heel,"
1246,I,"With God for their comfort only, the God whom they serve; and"
1247,I,here
1248,I,"Their Lord, of his great loving-kindness, may revel and make"
1249,I,good cheer;
1250,I,"Though ever his lips wax thirstier with drinking, and hotter the"
1251,I,lusts in him swell;

1255,II,II
1256,II,
1257,II,Fierce noon beats hard on the battle; the galleons that loom to
1258,II,the lee
1259,II,"Bow down, heel over, uplifting their shelterless hulls from the"
1260,II,sea:
1261,II,"From scuppers aspirt with blood, from guns dismounted and dumb,"
1262,II,"The signs of the doom they looked for, the loud mute witnesses"
1263,II,come.
1264,II,They press with sunset to seaward for comfort: and shall not they
1265,II,find it there?
1266,II,"O servants of God most high, shall his winds not pass you by, and"
1267,II,his waves not spare?
1268,II,
1269,III,III
1270,III,
1271,III,The wings of the south-west wind are widened; the breath of his
1272,III,"fervent lips,"
1273,III,"More keen than a sword's edge, fiercer than fire, falls full on the"
1274,III,plunging ships.
1275,III,"The pilot is he of their northward flight, their stay and their"
1276,III,steersman he;
1277,III,"A helmsman clothed with the tempest, and girdled with strength to"
1278,III,constrain the sea.
1279,III,"And the host of them trembles and quails, caught fast in his hand"
1280,III,as a bird in the toils;
1281,III,"For the wrath and the joy that fulfil him are mightier than man's,"
1282,III,whom he slays and spoils.
1283,III,"And vainly, with heart divided in sunder, and labour of wavering"
1284,III,"will,"
1285,III,The lord of their host takes counsel with hope if haply their star
1286,III,"shine still,"
1287,III,If haply some light be left them of chance to renew and redeem the
1288,III,fray;
1289,III,But the will of the black south-wester is lord of the councils of
1290,III,war to-day.
1291,III,"One only spirit it quells not, a splendour undarkened of chance or"
1292,III,time;
1293,III,"Be the praise of his foes with Oquendo for ever, a name as a star"
1294,III,sublime.
1295,III,"But here what aid in a hero's heart, what help in his hand may be?"
1296,III,For ever the dark wind whitens and blackens the hollows and heights
1297,III,"of the sea,"
1298,III,"And galley by galley, divided and desolate, founders; and none"
1299,III,"takes heed,"
1300,III,"Nor foe nor friend, if they perish; forlorn, cast off in their"

1310,III,And torn by the scourge of the storm-wind that smites as a harper
1311,III,"smites on a lyre,"
1312,III,And consumed of the storm as the sacrifice loved of their God is
1313,III,"consumed with fire,"
1314,III,And devoured of the darkness as men that are slain in the fires of

1326,III,"Day upon day upon day confounds them, with measureless mists that"

1374,III,yet find grace;
1375,III,"But grace, if another be hardened against him, he gets not at this"
1376,III,man's face.
1377,III,For his ear that hears and his eye that sees the wreck and the wail
1378,III,"of men,"
1379,III,"And his heart that relents not within him, but hungers, are like as"
1380,III,the wolf's in his den.
1381,III,"Worthy are these to worship their master, the murderous Lord of"
1382,III,"lies,"

1384,III,the keys of the skies.
1385,III,"Wild famine and red-shod rapine are cruel, and bitter with blood"

1388,III,hearts of priests.
1389,III,"God, God bade these to the battle; and here, on a land by his"

1393,III,"These also were fed of his priests with faith, with the milk of his"

1397,III,"And here, cast up from the ravening sea on the mild land's merciful"

1400,III,theirs of their quest.
1401,III,"Death was captain, and doom was pilot, and darkness the chart of"

2242,A WORD WITH THE WIND,"Well as yet we love the strength of the iron-tongued north-easter,"

2244,A WORD WITH THE WIND,"All thy ways are good, O wind, and all the world should fester,"
2245,A WORD WITH THE WIND,"Were thy fourfold godhead quenched, or stilled thy strife:"

2252,A WORD WITH THE WIND,"Sharp and strange from inland sounds thy bitter note of battle,"

2293,A WORD WITH THE WIND,"Half the world abhors thee beating back the sea, and blackening"
2294,A WORD WITH THE WIND,Heaven with fierce and woful change of fluctuant form:
2295,A WORD WITH THE WIND,"All the world acclaims thee shifting sail again, and slackening"
2296,A WORD WITH THE WIND,Cloud by cloud the close-reefed cordage of the storm.
2297,A WORD WITH THE WIND,Sweeter fields and brighter woods and lordlier hills than waken
2298,A WORD WITH THE WIND,Here at sunrise never hailed the sun and thee:

2356,NEAP-TIDE,Now no light is in heaven; and now
2357,NEAP-TIDE,Not a note of the sea-wind's tune
2358,NEAP-TIDE,Rings hither: the bleak sky's boon

2361,NEAP-TIDE,
2362,NEAP-TIDE,More sad than a moon that clouds beleaguer
2363,NEAP-TIDE,"And storm is a scourge to smite,"
2364,NEAP-TIDE,The sick sun's shadowlike light
2365,NEAP-TIDE,"Grows faint as the clouds and the waves wax eager,"
2366,NEAP-TIDE,And withers away from sight.

3759,DEDICATION,"The years are many, the changes more,"
3760,DEDICATION,Since wind and sun on the wild sweet shore
3761,DEDICATION,Where Joyous Gard stands stark by the sea
3762,DEDICATION,With face as bright as in years of yore
3763,DEDICATION,
3764,DEDICATION,"Shone, swept, and sounded, and laughed for glee"
3765,DEDICATION,"More deep than a man's or a child's may be,"
3766,DEDICATION,"On a day when summer was wild and glad,"
3767,DEDICATION,And the guests of the wind and the sun were we.
3768,DEDICATION,
3769,DEDICATION,The light that lightens from seasons clad
3770,DEDICATION,"With darkness now, is it glad or sad?"
3771,DEDICATION,"Not sad but glad should it shine, meseems,"
3772,DEDICATION,On eyes yet fain of the joy they had.
3773,DEDICATION,
3774,DEDICATION,For joy was there with us; joy that gleams
3775,DEDICATION,And murmurs yet in the world of dreams
3776,DEDICATION,"Where thought holds fast, as a constant warder,"
3777,DEDICATION,"The days when I rode by moors and streams,"
3778,DEDICATION,
3779,DEDICATION,Reining my rhymes into buoyant order
3780,DEDICATION,Through honied leagues of the northland border.
3781,DEDICATION,"Though thought or memory fade, and prove"
3782,DEDICATION,"A faithless keeper, a thriftless hoarder,"
3783,DEDICATION,
3784,DEDICATION,"One landmark never can change remove,"
3785,DEDICATION,"One sign can the years efface not. Love,"
3786,DEDICATION,"More strong than death or than doubt may be,"
3787,DEDICATION,"Treads down their strengths, and abides above."
3788,DEDICATION,
3789,DEDICATION,"Yea, change and death are his servants: we,"
3790,DEDICATION,"Whom love of the dead links fast, though free,"
3791,DEDICATION,May smile as they that beheld the dove
3792,DEDICATION,Bear home her signal across the sea.
