13,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,MY MOTHER'S KISS. 
14,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"My mother's kiss, my mother's kiss, I feel its impress now; As in the bright and happy days She pressed it on my brow. "
15,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,You say it is a fancied thing Within my memory fraught; To me it has a sacred place-- The treasure house of thought. 
16,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"Again, I feel her fingers glide Amid my clustering hair; I see the love-light in her eyes, When all my life was fair. "
17,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"Again, I hear her gentle voice In warning or in love. How precious was the faith that taught My soul of things above. "

22,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,And friends have placed upon my brow The laurels of renown; But she first taught me how to wear My manhood as a crown.

26,A GRAIN OF SAND.,A GRAIN OF SAND. 
27,A GRAIN OF SAND.,"Do you see this grain of sand Lying loosely in my hand? Do you know to me it brought Just a simple loving thought? When one gazes night by night On the glorious stars of light, Oh how little seems the span Measured round the life of man. "
28,A GRAIN OF SAND.,"Oh! how fleeting are his years With their smiles and their tears; Can it be that God does care For such atoms as we are? Then outspake this grain of sand ""I was fashioned by His hand In the star lit realms of space I was made to have a place. "
29,A GRAIN OF SAND.,"""Should the ocean flood the world, Were its mountains 'gainst me hurled All the force they could employ Wouldn't a single grain destroy; And if I, a thing so light, Have a place within His sight; You are linked unto his throne Cannot live nor die alone. "

36,THE CROCUSES.  5,THE CROCUSES.  5 
37,THE CROCUSES.  5,Though a tremor of the winter Did shivering through them run; Yet they lifted up their foreheads To greet the vernal sun. 
38,THE CROCUSES.  5,And the sunbeams gave them welcome. As did the morning air And scattered o'er their simple robes Rich tints of beauty rare. 
39,THE CROCUSES.  5,Soon a host of lovely flowers From vales and woodland burst; But in all that fair procession The crocuses were first. 
40,THE CROCUSES.  5,First to weave for Earth a chaplet To crown her dear old head; And to beautify the pathway Where winter still did tread. 
41,THE CROCUSES.  5,"And their loved and white haired mother Smiled sweetly 'neath the touch, When she knew her faithful children Were loving her so much. "

52,THE PRESENT AGE. 7,"From centuries of servile toil The Negro finds release, And builds the fanes of prayer and praise Unto the God of Peace. "
53,THE PRESENT AGE. 7,"England and Russia face to face With Central Asia meet; And on the far Pacific coast, Chinese and natives greet. "
54,THE PRESENT AGE. 7,Crusaders once with sword and shield The Holy Land to save; From Moslem hands did strive to clutch The dear Redeemer's grave.

599,THE BURDENS OF ALL.,"We may sigh o'er the heavy burdens Of the black, the brown and white; But if we all clasped hands together The burdens would be more light. How to solve life's saddest problems, Its weariness, want and woe, Was answered by One who suffered In Palestine long ago. "
600,THE BURDENS OF ALL.,"He gave from his heart this precept, To ease the burdens of men, ""As ye would that others do to you Do ye even so to them."" Life's heavy, wearisome burdens Will change to a gracious trust When men shall learn in the light of God To be merciful and just. "
601,THE BURDENS OF ALL.,"Where war has sharpened his weapons, And slavery masterful had, Let white and black and brown unite To build the kingdom of God. And never attempt in madness To build a kingdom or state, Through greed of gold or lust of power, On the crumbling stones of hate. "
602,THE BURDENS OF ALL.,"The burdens will always he heavy, The sunshine fade into night, Till mercy and justice shall cement The black, the brown and the white. And earth shall answer with gladness, The herald angel's refrain, When ""Peace on earth, good will to men"" Was the burden of their strain. "
