176,FIRST HORIZONS,"No lingering then;--a hundred things,"
177,FIRST HORIZONS,"New schemes, imagined happenings,"
178,FIRST HORIZONS,Called us away to wood and field--
179,FIRST HORIZONS,For any hour of life might yield
180,FIRST HORIZONS,"Some wonder, some unthought of bliss,"
181,FIRST HORIZONS,Some miracle we dared not miss.
182,FIRST HORIZONS,"And gladness, hidden in the springs"
183,FIRST HORIZONS,"Of purpose at the heart of things,"
184,FIRST HORIZONS,"Showed us a world where work was play,"
185,FIRST HORIZONS,And common labours of the day
186,FIRST HORIZONS,Sweet service; but we knew not then
187,FIRST HORIZONS,"The burdens men have laid on men,--"
188,FIRST HORIZONS,"Nay, only those perennial tasks"
189,FIRST HORIZONS,Which earth of all her children asks
190,FIRST HORIZONS,For fruitfulness; and glad were we
191,FIRST HORIZONS,Of that good fellowship to be;
192,FIRST HORIZONS,Nor sought more honour than to share
193,FIRST HORIZONS,"The sower’s toil, the shepherd’s care."
194,FIRST HORIZONS,But most we loved the merry ring
195,FIRST HORIZONS,"Of whetted scythes, the rhythmic swing"
196,FIRST HORIZONS,"Of mowers, and with fork and rake"
197,FIRST HORIZONS,All day to follow in their wake;
198,FIRST HORIZONS,And homeward in the eventide
199,FIRST HORIZONS,"On the piled waggon load to ride,"
200,FIRST HORIZONS,"While, half asleep amid the hay,"
201,FIRST HORIZONS,"Dim fields we saw and uplands grey,"
202,FIRST HORIZONS,And heard beneath our swaying load
203,FIRST HORIZONS,The rumbling wheel along the road.
204,FIRST HORIZONS,
205,FIRST HORIZONS,No need had we the world to roam
206,FIRST HORIZONS,"To find new shores, for round our home"
207,FIRST HORIZONS,Our undiscovered lands arose
208,FIRST HORIZONS,"In autumn mists, in winter snows."
209,FIRST HORIZONS,On summer nights in whispering trees
210,FIRST HORIZONS,"We heard the wash of Indian seas,"
211,FIRST HORIZONS,And ripening waves of harvest rolled
212,FIRST HORIZONS,Over our hills the realms of gold;
213,FIRST HORIZONS,And flood-time mapped familiar lands
214,FIRST HORIZONS,With island shores and foreign strands;
215,FIRST HORIZONS,And tidings of unventured ways
216,FIRST HORIZONS,We gathered in the darkening days
217,FIRST HORIZONS,When leafless woods began to moan
218,FIRST HORIZONS,And twilight opened gates unknown.
219,FIRST HORIZONS,"A narrower, homelier world we knew"
220,FIRST HORIZONS,"In winter time, and kinder grew"
221,FIRST HORIZONS,The sheltering bounds of landmarks old;
222,FIRST HORIZONS,"And, gathered within farm and fold,"
223,FIRST HORIZONS,The sound of voices and the stir
224,FIRST HORIZONS,Of labour seemed the merrier
225,FIRST HORIZONS,Because so lonely and so wide
226,FIRST HORIZONS,And homeless was the world outside.
227,FIRST HORIZONS,"Then we discovered golden shores,"
228,FIRST HORIZONS,"Our El Dorado’s treasure stores,"
229,FIRST HORIZONS,Amid the piled up sheaves of grain
230,FIRST HORIZONS,Within the barn; and while the rain
231,FIRST HORIZONS,Beat on the roofs we burrowed deep
232,FIRST HORIZONS,"In rustling caves, or from the heap"
233,FIRST HORIZONS,"Threw down our golden citadel,"
234,FIRST HORIZONS,While girls unbound the sheaves that fell
235,FIRST HORIZONS,"For threshing, and as each new load"
236,FIRST HORIZONS,"Between the spinning rollers flowed,"
237,FIRST HORIZONS,"The hum of wheels, the engine’s drone"
238,FIRST HORIZONS,A sudden octave fell in tone;
239,FIRST HORIZONS,"And grain was stored, and billows soft"
240,FIRST HORIZONS,"Of straw went rolling to the loft,"
241,FIRST HORIZONS,And out on skies of cheerless grey
242,FIRST HORIZONS,The winnowed chaff was blown away.
243,FIRST HORIZONS,
244,FIRST HORIZONS,But after days of winter rains
245,FIRST HORIZONS,Came mornings when our window-panes
246,FIRST HORIZONS,Were bright with sunshine and embossed
247,FIRST HORIZONS,With silver trellises of frost;
248,FIRST HORIZONS,"And out we rushed across the yard,"
249,FIRST HORIZONS,"Down rutty cart tracks, frozen hard,"
250,FIRST HORIZONS,And round the farm sheds and the fold
251,FIRST HORIZONS,To match our blood against the cold;
252,FIRST HORIZONS,"And every one we met was gay,"
253,FIRST HORIZONS,And had the pleasant word to say.
254,FIRST HORIZONS,"What, then, were dreams of summer worth,"
255,FIRST HORIZONS,While magic regions of the north
256,FIRST HORIZONS,"Lay round us, and o’er fields of snow,"
257,FIRST HORIZONS,"Along the river’s overflow,"
258,FIRST HORIZONS,"Were Arctic seas, with many a shore"
259,FIRST HORIZONS,And frozen inlet to explore?--
260,FIRST HORIZONS,Or while we tracked through forests bare
261,FIRST HORIZONS,Wild creatures to their hidden lair?
262,FIRST HORIZONS,"Or, when the snow had drifted deep,"
263,FIRST HORIZONS,"We helped to find the scattered sheep,"
264,FIRST HORIZONS,"Or, with the shepherds and their dogs,"
265,FIRST HORIZONS,Sat round a fire of brush and logs
266,FIRST HORIZONS,"At nightfall, when old tales were told"
267,FIRST HORIZONS,"Of other days, and clear and cold"
268,FIRST HORIZONS,The starlight shone above the fold?
269,FIRST HORIZONS,
270,FIRST HORIZONS,"Not then, but when the wild South-west"
271,FIRST HORIZONS,Filled the dim land with its unrest
272,FIRST HORIZONS,"At twilight, and the woods began"
273,FIRST HORIZONS,"To talk of things unknown to man,"
274,FIRST HORIZONS,And on the garden paths we heard
275,FIRST HORIZONS,"Strange footsteps, but no answering word"
276,FIRST HORIZONS,Came to our call;--
277,FIRST HORIZONS,’twas then the spell
278,FIRST HORIZONS,"Of mystery about us fell,"
279,FIRST HORIZONS,The awe that held us half-afraid
280,FIRST HORIZONS,"To pass beyond our gates, but made"
281,FIRST HORIZONS,The shelter of our homely bounds
282,FIRST HORIZONS,"So welcome, and familiar sounds"
283,FIRST HORIZONS,So sweet; ’twas then before us rose
284,FIRST HORIZONS,"The vision of ancestral foes,"
285,FIRST HORIZONS,And in our ears old battle calls
286,FIRST HORIZONS,At night around beleaguered walls
287,FIRST HORIZONS,"Rang; and, though all was safe and still,"
288,FIRST HORIZONS,"Old dangers set our hearts a-thrill,"
289,FIRST HORIZONS,And in the silent courtyard made
290,FIRST HORIZONS,Each door and arch an ambuscade;
291,FIRST HORIZONS,And passing through our sleeping camp
292,FIRST HORIZONS,"We heard the stabled horses champ,"
293,FIRST HORIZONS,And started as a halter whirred
294,FIRST HORIZONS,Along the chain rings when they stirred.
295,FIRST HORIZONS,
296,FIRST HORIZONS,"Then, with our day’s adventures o’er,"
297,FIRST HORIZONS,"Safe housed, we heard the muffled roar"
298,FIRST HORIZONS,"Of winds without, and round the fire"
299,FIRST HORIZONS,"Sought for the land of heart’s desire,"
300,FIRST HORIZONS,Or sailed across the Spanish main
301,FIRST HORIZONS,In well-loved books; or lived again
302,FIRST HORIZONS,"In knightly days of long ago,"
303,FIRST HORIZONS,And heard the horn of Ivanhoe
304,FIRST HORIZONS,"At Ashby lists; or, on his steed"
305,FIRST HORIZONS,"At Acre, saw King Richard lead"
306,FIRST HORIZONS,"His pilgrim soldiers, worn and thin,"
307,FIRST HORIZONS,That broke the ranks of Saladin:--
308,FIRST HORIZONS,"Till, in the thickest of some fight,"
309,FIRST HORIZONS,Or when the captive maiden’s plight
310,FIRST HORIZONS,"Was sorest, suddenly the spell"
311,FIRST HORIZONS,"Was broken, and a welcome bell"
312,FIRST HORIZONS,Our own forgotten days restored
313,FIRST HORIZONS,And called us to the supper board;
314,FIRST HORIZONS,"Where, with our elders gathered round,"
315,FIRST HORIZONS,"Good cheer and fellowship we found,"
316,FIRST HORIZONS,And oft a neighbour or a guest
317,FIRST HORIZONS,To tell the news or speed the jest.
318,FIRST HORIZONS,
319,FIRST HORIZONS,And all too quickly afterwards
320,FIRST HORIZONS,"Our bedtime came, and at their cards"
321,FIRST HORIZONS,And talk we left them. In the hall
322,FIRST HORIZONS,"The firelight flickered on the wall,"
323,FIRST HORIZONS,"Deep shadows thronged the winding stair,"
324,FIRST HORIZONS,"And overhead, we knew not where,"
325,FIRST HORIZONS,A footstep fell upon the floor
326,FIRST HORIZONS,Of some deserted corridor.
327,FIRST HORIZONS,
328,FIRST HORIZONS,"But, once within our cheerful room,"
329,FIRST HORIZONS,No hidden phantom of the gloom
330,FIRST HORIZONS,Came near us; and in bed we lay
331,FIRST HORIZONS,And heard the wind that far away
332,FIRST HORIZONS,"Now seemed to blow,--as storms outside"
333,FIRST HORIZONS,Might seem to those whose vessels ride
334,FIRST HORIZONS,Rocked on the gentle rise and fall
335,FIRST HORIZONS,Of tides within the haven wall.

341,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,
342,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,
343,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Were they not memories of things known before,--"
344,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Not the strange vision of an unknown shore,"
345,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,That met us when in childhood we began
346,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"To look upon our dwelling-place, and ran"
347,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Fearless to meet our fortune; when our eyes
348,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Saw life with wonder, but without surprise;"
349,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"When, though newcomers, no strange note we heard"
350,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,In voice of wind or wave or song of bird;
351,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,And looking on the hills and trees and flowers
352,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"We loved, and without question made them ours;"
353,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,And trusted the dumb creature and the hand
354,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"That guided us, nor sought to understand?"
355,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Were they not greetings of things old and dear,--"
356,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Not the strange voices of an alien sphere,--"
357,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"That greeted us and linked us, with a bond"
358,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Of speech familiar, to some home beyond?"
359,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,
360,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,We were a part of all that we beheld
361,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,In those young days: it was our joy that welled
362,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Into the sunshine with the mountain rill,"
363,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Our heart that in the rose’s heart lay still,"
364,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Our wings that held the sea-bird o’er the foam,"
365,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Our feet that brought the wandering outcast home.
366,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Earth had no secret that we could not share,"
367,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,For everything we saw and loved we were.
368,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,
369,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Not when defenceless on the earth we stood
370,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,In childhood doubted we that life was good.
371,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Not when love made us part of everything
372,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Could we distrust the hidden fountain-spring.
373,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,But when the years began to separate
374,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"From Life our lives, when all that once seemed great"
375,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"In heaven and earth, all wonder and delight"
376,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Were narrowed to the measure of our sight;
377,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,When knowledge of the suffering and wrong
378,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"That nature dealt the weak to serve the strong,"
379,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,When records of man’s greed and lust and pride
380,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Defaced life’s beauty, and its hope belied,--"
381,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"How had we then that mockery withstood,"
382,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Or trusted that the source of life was good,"
383,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Had not the memory of its old caress
384,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Reproached our hearts in their unfaithfulness;
385,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Had we not once beheld a face so sweet
386,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,It could not but express a heart that beat
387,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"For us, and knew what waited us, the while"
388,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,It armed us for the darkness with its smile;
389,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Had we not known those vanished hours that wove
390,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,Of homely human bonds immortal love;
391,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"Of flowers, and stars, and woods, and mountain streams,"
392,THE FOUNTAIN-SPRINGS,"And things that die, imperishable dreams?"

489,THE FOREST,
490,THE FOREST,
491,THE FOREST,"Far away to hills of blue,"
492,THE FOREST,"Sunlit pastures, uplands wide,"
493,THE FOREST,"Ways familiar, homes we knew,"
494,THE FOREST,Round us lay on every side
495,THE FOREST,"Save on one; on one alone,"
496,THE FOREST,"Where the ancient forest spread,"
497,THE FOREST,"Paths began with ends unknown,"
498,THE FOREST,Twilight loomed in daylight’s stead.
499,THE FOREST,
500,THE FOREST,Soft as waves of summer seas
501,THE FOREST,"Flowing on a lonely strand,"
502,THE FOREST,Rolled along that wall of trees
503,THE FOREST,Shining waves of meadow-land;
504,THE FOREST,Bright as founts of lighted spray
505,THE FOREST,"Tossed against a rocky ledge,"
506,THE FOREST,"Banks of primrose, boughs of May"
507,THE FOREST,Fringed the forest’s sombre edge.
508,THE FOREST,
509,THE FOREST,Here the wild domain began
510,THE FOREST,"Touched not by the hand of man,"
511,THE FOREST,"Tangled, orderless, o’er-grown,"
512,THE FOREST,"Tended not nor reaped nor sown,"
513,THE FOREST,Yet majestically decked
514,THE FOREST,"In the robes of its neglect,"
515,THE FOREST,With the forms that beauty shaped
516,THE FOREST,Out of its confusion draped:--
517,THE FOREST,Beauty that our youthful eyes
518,THE FOREST,"Sought not, but in other guise"
519,THE FOREST,"Reached us, and before our feet"
520,THE FOREST,"With a reassurance sweet,"
521,THE FOREST,When the path was dark and drear
522,THE FOREST,Into wonder changed our fear.
523,THE FOREST,Soon the spirit of the woods
524,THE FOREST,"Made us creatures of its own,"
525,THE FOREST,"Charmed us to its ancient moods,"
526,THE FOREST,Tuned us to its sombre tone;
527,THE FOREST,"Whispered in the tangled deeps,"
528,THE FOREST,"Showed us, in the twilight rays,"
529,THE FOREST,"Secrets that the noonday keeps,"
530,THE FOREST,Wonders lost on homely ways.
531,THE FOREST,Where the forest creatures led
532,THE FOREST,Lay our path;--the fox that crept
533,THE FOREST,"Through the fern, or, overhead,"
534,THE FOREST,"Squirrels that before us leapt,"
535,THE FOREST,"These we followed, or perchance"
536,THE FOREST,"Startled herds that past us flew,"
537,THE FOREST,Leaving but an antler’s glance
538,THE FOREST,Through the tree trunks for a clue.
539,THE FOREST,In their wildness something stirred
540,THE FOREST,"Eager passion of the chase,"
541,THE FOREST,"Made us foes of beast and bird,"
542,THE FOREST,Spoilers of the nesting-place;
543,THE FOREST,"Yet their wildness we could share,"
544,THE FOREST,"We were creatures of the wood,"
545,THE FOREST,With them reached the hidden lair
546,THE FOREST,"Not pursuing, but pursued."
547,THE FOREST,"These, the wild and timid things,"
548,THE FOREST,"Kinship in our hearts awoke,--"
549,THE FOREST,These we knew; but whisperings
550,THE FOREST,"Came of strange unearthly folk,--"
551,THE FOREST,"Dwarfs, and Leprechauns and elves,--"
552,THE FOREST,"Seen by others, not ourselves;"
553,THE FOREST,"Though at times a cry’s escape,"
554,THE FOREST,"Or a gliding shadow-shape,"
555,THE FOREST,Proved them near us as they stole
556,THE FOREST,Out of sight from hole to hole;
557,THE FOREST,Or when from the unknown track
558,THE FOREST,"Half afraid we hastened back,"
559,THE FOREST,While the night began to close
560,THE FOREST,Round us and the wind arose:
561,THE FOREST,Then throughout the forest stirred
562,THE FOREST,"Old enchantments, and we heard"
563,THE FOREST,Rushing wings of phantom hosts
564,THE FOREST,"Overhead; and whispering ghosts,"
565,THE FOREST,Outcasts of forgotten tombs
566,THE FOREST,"Wandering through the forest glooms,"
567,THE FOREST,Crossed our path; and demons grim
568,THE FOREST,Hung on every creaking limb.
569,THE FOREST,Then how glad were we to near
570,THE FOREST,"Homely ways and human cheer,"
571,THE FOREST,"When, beyond the forest bounds,"
572,THE FOREST,Once again familiar sounds
573,THE FOREST,"Reached us, and the end of day"
574,THE FOREST,"Glimmered on horizons grey,"
575,THE FOREST,Over uplands far away.
576,THE FOREST,
577,THE FOREST,"Golden morrows showed no mark,"
578,THE FOREST,"Glittering pathways gave no trace,"
579,THE FOREST,Where those legions of the dark
580,THE FOREST,Made their noonday hiding-place.
581,THE FOREST,"Where the elfin hosts had rushed,"
582,THE FOREST,Where had fallen the wizard bane
583,THE FOREST,"Not a flower had been crushed,"
584,THE FOREST,Never dewdrop had a stain.
585,THE FOREST,
586,THE FOREST,Then an idle way we took
587,THE FOREST,"Where the little wandering brook,"
588,THE FOREST,"Overflowing mossy wells,"
589,THE FOREST,"Flashing out of twilight shades,"
590,THE FOREST,"Beckoned us to secret dells,"
591,THE FOREST,Led us into fairy glades.
592,THE FOREST,Here the sunlight filtered through
593,THE FOREST,"Woven trellises of blue,"
594,THE FOREST,Dropping from a sky unseen
595,THE FOREST,Into hollows golden-green.
596,THE FOREST,"Jays, in azure flashes, slid"
597,THE FOREST,Out of hollows where they hid;
598,THE FOREST,Golden crested wrens among
599,THE FOREST,Feathery boughs of larches hung;
600,THE FOREST,Gentle winds in dreaming firs
601,THE FOREST,Touched æolian dulcimers;
602,THE FOREST,Dancing shadows fell across
603,THE FOREST,Fairy rings on floors of moss;
604,THE FOREST,Over rocks of weathered grey
605,THE FOREST,Tapestries of wild rose lay;
606,THE FOREST,Here the forest’s magic spells
607,THE FOREST,Hung on dappled foxglove bells;
608,THE FOREST,"Here the dreams of twilight pale,"
609,THE FOREST,"Stealing out to golden light,"
610,THE FOREST,Shaped themselves in petals frail
611,THE FOREST,Clothed themselves in blossoms white.
612,THE FOREST,
613,THE FOREST,Not within the golden dell
614,THE FOREST,Could we rest:--the wild and lone
615,THE FOREST,"Laid on us a stronger spell,"
616,THE FOREST,Called us to a world unknown.
617,THE FOREST,Down untrodden paths would break
618,THE FOREST,"Gleams remote, that still foretold"
619,THE FOREST,"New discoveries to make,"
620,THE FOREST,Always greater than the old.
621,THE FOREST,"There, beyond us, never gained,"
622,THE FOREST,"Lay the regions of our quest,"
623,THE FOREST,There our wonderlands remained
624,THE FOREST,"Unbeholden, unpossessed;--"
625,THE FOREST,"Wonderlands no truth could mar,"
626,THE FOREST,"Dreams no wakening could blot,"
627,THE FOREST,"Lovelier because so far,"
628,THE FOREST,Real because we found them not.

640,FIRST LOVE,
641,FIRST LOVE,"We had no aims nor joys apart,"

645,FIRST LOVE,

663,FIRST LOVE,Its wonder too.
664,FIRST LOVE,
665,FIRST LOVE,Her heart my secret never guessed;

676,THE WORLD’S END,"Where did they end,--those pathways wild and lone"
677,THE WORLD’S END,Through the dark forest? Lay some shore unknown
678,THE WORLD’S END,"Beyond them, where the wind first taught the trees"
679,THE WORLD’S END,The sweet sad voices of the murmuring seas?
680,THE WORLD’S END,"Oh, whither did they call? The long arcades"
681,THE WORLD’S END,"Led ever to remoter, dimmer shades;"
682,THE WORLD’S END,And from the farthest crest a pathway dipped
683,THE WORLD’S END,Down to some lonelier aisle or darker crypt.
684,THE WORLD’S END,"Dear were the open fields to us, and dear"
685,THE WORLD’S END,"The homely path, the sound of human cheer;"
686,THE WORLD’S END,"But ’twas the way no foot of man had worn,"
687,THE WORLD’S END,"The forest’s undiscoverable bourne,"
688,THE WORLD’S END,"That made our world so wide, its end so far:"
689,THE WORLD’S END,"And when, in the evening through the trees, a star"
690,THE WORLD’S END,"Shone o’er the darkening solitudes, it seemed"
691,THE WORLD’S END,Nearer than those long quests of which we dreamed.
692,THE WORLD’S END,
693,THE WORLD’S END,One day we wandered farther than before
694,THE WORLD’S END,Through leafy maze and dusky corridor
695,THE WORLD’S END,"Into the forest’s heart, when far away"
696,THE WORLD’S END,We saw a low horizon line of grey
697,THE WORLD’S END,Where all before was dark; and by degrees
698,THE WORLD’S END,Through wider openings among the trees
699,THE WORLD’S END,The daylight grew; and we who thought we stood
700,THE WORLD’S END,Deep in the hidden cloisters of the wood
701,THE WORLD’S END,"Were at its end,--only at last to find"
702,THE WORLD’S END,A world like that which we had left behind.
703,THE WORLD’S END,"There, out beyond us in the evening gold,"
704,THE WORLD’S END,"Lay homely meadowlands, and farm and fold:"
705,THE WORLD’S END,The path we followed to the unknown shore
706,THE WORLD’S END,Led in the end but to some cottage door.
707,THE WORLD’S END,
708,THE WORLD’S END,"There, with the forest’s end, those regions vast"
709,THE WORLD’S END,"That childhood showed us, into dreamland passed."
710,THE WORLD’S END,"The great world was beyond us; far away,"
711,THE WORLD’S END,"Over the hills, the lands we knew not lay,--"
712,THE WORLD’S END,But others knew them! Now the secret clue
713,THE WORLD’S END,"We followed melted in the noonday’s blue,"
714,THE WORLD’S END,Or hid among the stars. That broken road
715,THE WORLD’S END,"Taught us the boundaries of our abode,--"
716,THE WORLD’S END,The gulf ’twixt heaven and earth. A bridge unseen
717,THE WORLD’S END,The hope or faith of man might build between
718,THE WORLD’S END,Our home on earth and some celestial shore;
719,THE WORLD’S END,But ’twas for us no longer to explore
720,THE WORLD’S END,The paths of brave adventure which we trod

739,YOUTH,"Of paths that once were endless, who ascends"
740,YOUTH,"The peaks that once in heaven seemed to glow,"

754,YOUTH,"Pleasures beguile him, and that light within"

761,YOUTH,That shall reveal the maiden of his dream.
762,YOUTH,His faith is in himself: he would reform
763,YOUTH,"The world with love, and take his Heaven by storm."
764,YOUTH,The great adventure calls him: he would build

870,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Each ripple of the mountain stream that flowed
871,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Beside us, every drop of sunlit dew"
872,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"That filled the flowers that on the wayside grew,"
873,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,The laughter of the south-west wind at play
874,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Along its own untrodden path of blue,"
875,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"All made the earth forget its yesterday,"
876,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And with their own youth touched that old and beaten way.
877,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,
878,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,They told us that our road would lead at last
879,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Into the world,--not that which once was spread"
880,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Before our childhood’s dream, unknown and vast,"
881,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,But one which man had fashioned in its stead.
882,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"This world lay now before us, and we sped"
883,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"To drink its wonders, counting not the cost."
884,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Our endless pathways to their ends had led;
885,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,The bounds of our unbounded we had crossed;
886,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"The unknown way was found, but our old world was lost."
887,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,
888,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"We had exchanged our infinite domains,"
889,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"The undiscovered regions of our quest,"
890,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,For the round earth wherein no sea remains
891,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Uncharted, and no land is unpossessed;"
892,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,But still our hearts were filled with the old zest
893,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,To travel and adventure and explore:
894,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"The unknown called us, we could find no rest"
895,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Till, by those paths which men had trod before,"
896,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,We found the world they found and bore the loads they bore.
897,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,
898,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,With every soul that on the earth is born
899,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,The whole creation is made young again;
900,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And all the paths that pilgrim feet have worn
901,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Are new for those who follow,--every stain"
902,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"That marred them is washed out by sun and rain,"
903,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And verdure fresh makes all their borders sweet.
904,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"So on that road of bygone joy and pain,"
905,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"With the day’s new-born flowers about our feet,"
906,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,We sought an ancient world grown young our youth to greet.
907,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,
908,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"And pleasant of that world it was to think,"
909,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And all that we had heard in song and lore
910,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Of old grey cities on the ocean’s brink,"
911,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Where to their anchorage the great ships bore
912,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Bales from the Orient, and golden store"
913,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"From the far south, and, dark and grim and tall,"
914,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Behind the dreaming masts rose floor on floor,"
915,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Warehouse and granary, and over all"
916,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Loomed some great tower or dome of Mary or of Paul.
917,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,
918,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,The vanished regions of our old surmise
919,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"We mourned not now, for eager we had grown"
920,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"To read the record of the centuries,"
921,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And enter the great kingdoms of the known.
922,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Ay! better than the unexplored and lone
923,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,We deemed that world in which the human heart
924,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Was written, where mankind had built and sown,"
925,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"And fought for truth and love, and taken part"
926,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,In the eighth day’s creation--God-inspired Art.
927,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,
928,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"And now our island earth, our bounded home"
929,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Took new dimensions,--Time transfigured Space;"
930,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And we beheld vast realms through which to roam
931,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Within the limits of our dwelling-place.
932,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Dim pathways of the past we turned to pace,"
933,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And far receding vistas of the years
934,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Opened old wonderlands; ’twas ours to trace
935,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"The labyrinths of love, the vales of tears,"
936,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And toward the unknown future march as pioneers.
937,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,
938,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Along the borders of that beaten way
939,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Was many a landmark of man’s mortal fate;
940,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"But hope was ever written in decay,"
941,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And simple things interpreted the great.
942,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,A charm was in the wild flowers to translate
943,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Death’s ruth, a benediction in the stone"
944,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Of ruined abbey walls to consecrate
945,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"The skies that roofed them, and to link the lone"
946,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Illimitable paths of heaven with our own.
947,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,
948,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,But for far heavenly paths we had no care
949,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"While still that road before us was untried,"
950,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"And the world called to us its joys to share,"
951,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Its lore to read, its destinies to guide."
952,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Our hearts were filled with a terrestrial pride;
953,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,We loved our world and gloried in the fame
954,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Of those who in its service lived and died,"
955,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Who fought and laboured to create its claim
956,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,Amid the countless spheres to hold an honoured name.
957,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,
958,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"To other gods than ours the past has knelt,"
959,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And creed and cause may sever us or bind;
960,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,But here upon our common road we felt
961,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"The bond of bonds that links all humankind,--"
962,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"Man’s pilgrim fellowship. Through rain and wind,"
963,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"In sunshine and beneath the starry deep,"
964,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"There is one goal for all the world to find,"
965,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,"A sacred hope to guard, a watch to keep,"
966,THE ROAD INTO THE WORLD,And in a little while the comradeship of sleep.

975,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,A valley of ancient homes and fields with shadowy trees.
976,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,The south-west wind was soft with the breath of the south-west seas;
977,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,Our unknown pathway followed the wandering song of a rill.

982,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"Gold of the evening, rose of the sunset, twilight grey."
983,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,
984,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"But the way, the way was unknown, and each turn of the way unguessed,"

986,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"And filled the whispering woods and the flowers that hung in the dew,"
987,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,And dreamed on the darkening hills and the roselit cloud in the west.

989,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"Twilight fell on the land, and clear against vistas dim"
990,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"Near things stood large,--the towers of ancient elms"
991,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"Loomed on glimmering fields, dark keeps of shadowy realms;"
992,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,And the first stars shone in the eastern sky on the upland’s rim.
993,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,
994,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"One by one around us, golden lights in the dusk"
995,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,Glowed in many a window of unseen cottage and farm:
996,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,And sweet through the cool of the dew came ripples of air still warm
997,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,From the shelter of old walled gardens that breathed of honey and musk.
998,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,
999,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,We came to a little village and our rest at the long day’s close:

1001,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,The stars looked down on the stars in the dark pool under the mill;
1002,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,The infinite deeps of the heaven were touched with the earth’s repose.
1003,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,
1004,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,Bright heavenly tracts outshone; but never a way so sweet
1005,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"As a homely path on the earth where the wild flowers hid in the dew,"
1006,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"And a girl went home through the fields, and the darkness thrilled"
1007,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,with a clue
1008,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,That linked the loneliest star with the flowers she touched with

1011,THE COUNTRY OVER THE HILL,"And pleasant it was to rest awhile in that old-world nook,"

1020,YOUTH AND LOVE,
1021,YOUTH AND LOVE,
1022,YOUTH AND LOVE,Over our pilgrim fellowship there came
1023,YOUTH AND LOVE,"A change, and though our road was still the same"
1024,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Our dreams divided us, and visions fair"
1025,YOUTH AND LOVE,Filled us with longings that we could not share.
1026,YOUTH AND LOVE,All that once called us to the unknown quest
1027,YOUTH AND LOVE,Was hidden now within a maiden’s breast;
1028,YOUTH AND LOVE,All that was far away and wild and sweet
1029,YOUTH AND LOVE,Shone in her eyes and blossomed at her feet.
1030,YOUTH AND LOVE,"She was our wonderland, our golden shore,"
1031,YOUTH AND LOVE,"The unknown world we travelled to explore,"
1032,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Our goal, not one far distant and unseen,"
1033,YOUTH AND LOVE,"But near, and with no barrier between"
1034,YOUTH AND LOVE,"To check us or to hide it from our sight,"
1035,YOUTH AND LOVE,Save our own hesitation or her flight.
1036,YOUTH AND LOVE,Across the beaten road she passed; she led
1037,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Through trackless regions, beckoned us or fled,"
1038,YOUTH AND LOVE,We knew not which; we knew not if her face
1039,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Appealed for help, or called us to the chase."
1040,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Strife and confusion to our lives she brought,"
1041,YOUTH AND LOVE,But life itself in lovelier hues she wrought.
1042,YOUTH AND LOVE,"She was our spirit’s guide, our passion’s lure:"
1043,YOUTH AND LOVE,She was the world’s undoing and its cure.
1044,YOUTH AND LOVE,
1045,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Of this enchantment, of the wild pursuit"
1046,YOUTH AND LOVE,"That woke in us the errant knight or brute,"
1047,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Of this confusion that upon us fell,"
1048,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Some do not speak, and none the same thing tell;"
1049,YOUTH AND LOVE,And some were lost or made themselves a track
1050,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Through lands unknown, and some at last came back,--"
1051,YOUTH AND LOVE,"One with a new light shining in his eyes,"
1052,YOUTH AND LOVE,"One with the burden of his memories,"
1053,YOUTH AND LOVE,"One with his blood for new pursuit on fire,"
1054,YOUTH AND LOVE,One weary seeking for his heart’s desire;
1055,YOUTH AND LOVE,And one who brought back to the beaten road
1056,YOUTH AND LOVE,A song of love that lightened half our load.
1057,YOUTH AND LOVE,
1058,YOUTH AND LOVE,Comrades we met again; but though the way
1059,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Was still the same, and though the night and day,"
1060,YOUTH AND LOVE,"The flowers at our feet, the stars above,"
1061,YOUTH AND LOVE,"Shone as before,--the mystery of love"
1062,YOUTH AND LOVE,Filled heaven and earth with something new and sweet
1063,YOUTH AND LOVE,"And wild and sorrowful and incomplete,"
1064,YOUTH AND LOVE,And once more called us to the unknown quest
1065,YOUTH AND LOVE,To seek the unfulfilled and unpossessed.
1066,YOUTH AND LOVE,

1075,I,"She tempted him; for such was Nature’s plan,"
1076,I,"Who, thinking of the fruit, the flowers arrayed,"
1077,I,And seeking for the surest guardian
1078,I,"Of life to be, gave beauty to the maid."
1079,I,
1080,I,"He courted her with glowing flatteries,"
1081,I,"With praises that he then deemed nought but truth,"
1082,I,"While all he sought seemed hidden in her eyes,"
1083,I,And all the joy of earth was in her youth.
1084,I,
1085,I,He gave her the brief homage of desire;
1086,I,She gave him what a maid but once can give;
1087,I,"She lit, but could not keep alight, love’s fire;"
1088,I,"They parted, they had still their lives to live."
1089,I,
1090,I,And many a merry bout with many a lass
1091,I,"Had he, until a wiser course he saw,"
1092,I,And wedded a fair lady of his class
1093,I,Who bore him children sanctioned by the law.
1094,I,
1095,I,"She kept her secret and her love of life,"
1096,I,"And, wistful sometimes when that episode"
1097,I,"Her dreams recalled, became an honest wife,"
1098,I,And shared with a good man the common load.
1099,I,
1100,I,
1101,II,II
1102,II,
1103,II,"Another of our comrades, in those days"
1104,II,"When wisdom has for youth no argument,"
1105,II,And conscience on him no commandment lays
1106,II,"That can prevail against a maid’s consent,--"
1107,II,
1108,II,He also found that ’twas the hot pursuit
1109,II,And not the maiden that inspired his zest;
1110,II,And other fairer maids of fleeter foot
1111,II,Called him from one too easily possessed.
1112,II,
1113,II,But she was not of those who make the slip
1114,II,"And miss the fall, like many a merry dame:"
1115,II,"She felt the tightening of dishonour’s grip,"
1116,II,Still loving him who brought on her the shame.
1117,II,
1118,II,"And one day walking by a river bank,"
1119,II,He found a little group of villagers
1120,II,"Standing beside a body, dead and dank,--"
1121,II,And when he looked the face he saw was hers.
1122,II,
1123,II,"The conduct of these comrades was akin,"
1124,II,Though the world read it in the sequel’s light:
1125,II,The one through life recalled a pleasant sin;
1126,II,Remorse pursued the other day and night.
1127,II,
1128,II,"And, are you Nature’s weakling instrument,"
1129,II,Your fortune may be such as prompts a laugh
1130,II,Among good fellows; or the fire she lent
1131,II,May burn into your soul an epitaph.
1132,II,
1133,II,
1134,III,III
1135,III,
1136,III,He was a man whose instincts all inclined
1137,III,"To virtue, when the path of virtue led"
1138,III,"Through pleasant places; venial, but too kind"
1139,III,"To wrong a woman, and too poor to wed."
1140,III,
1141,III,"She, weak and all too generously dowered"
1142,III,"By Nature with the warmth of womanhood,--"
1143,III,Her Tree of Life was wantonly deflowered
1144,III,Ere she had learned the evil and the good.
1145,III,
1146,III,She joined the outcast sisterhood who play
1147,III,"The loveless parts of love that they may live,"
1148,III,"And feigned the passion that had ebbed away,"
1149,III,And sold what she was born on earth to give.
1150,III,
1151,III,"See love, that once like crystal springs welled up"
1152,III,"In cloisters of the hills without a stain,"
1153,III,Here served as from a common drinking cup
1154,III,Held at a city fountain by a chain!
1155,III,
1156,III,"Chance brought these two together, and they played"
1157,III,"At lover’s parts, while each the falsehood guessed:"
1158,III,"She read old Brute Desire’s masquerade,"
1159,III,He knew that ’twas his gold that she caressed.
1160,III,
1161,III,His heart was touched with less of scorn than ruth
1162,III,For her and for her sisters; soon he paid
1163,III,"Not with gold only, but with dreams of youth,"
1164,III,And half his former faith in man and maid.
1165,III,
1166,III,Soon was her brief career of folly run;
1167,III,"And, beauty fading, left her poor indeed;"
1168,III,"Nor, of her hundred lovers, was there one"
1169,III,To help her in the hour of pain and need.

1172,IV,IV
1173,IV,
1174,IV,Of those whom Passion’s wandering desires
1175,IV,"Drove or beguiled to gates that duty barred,"
1176,IV,The contest of the elemental fires
1177,IV,"Of flesh and spirit strengthened some, some marred."
1178,IV,
1179,IV,"These conscious of the right, to sin afraid,"
1180,IV,"Obedient in deed but not in heart,--"
1181,IV,"These never brought dishonour on a maid,"
1182,IV,Nor left their gold with women of the mart;
1183,IV,
1184,IV,"But, while the outward evil they eschewed,"
1185,IV,They lusted for the fruit they dared not touch;
1186,IV,"The path they feared to tread their dreams pursued,"
1187,IV,And left them bondsmen in temptation’s clutch;
1188,IV,
1189,IV,"Who ruled by appetites they dared not feed,"
1190,IV,"And cursed by passions that were meant to bless,"
1191,IV,Learnt that to such abstention is decreed
1192,IV,Punishment stern as that which smites excess.
1193,IV,
1194,IV,"The others no less warm of blood than they,"
1195,IV,"Like them by duty checked in the pursuit,"
1196,IV,"Disdained to peer through gates that barred the way,"
1197,IV,And feed their fancies on forbidden fruit.
1198,IV,
1199,IV,"Their faith in love, like the clear noonday lit"
1200,IV,"Those tangled pathways of the lure, the mesh:"
1201,IV,They went their way refusing to submit
1202,IV,To tyrannies of conscience or of flesh.
1203,IV,
1204,IV,"They matched their wills with nature’s brutal force,"
1205,IV,And readily their servant it became:
1206,IV,Their joy was like the rider’s in the horse
1207,IV,Whose spirit he controls but would not tame.
1208,IV,
1209,IV,"Life’s keen activities, the toil, the play,"
1210,IV,"The venture, all that put their strength to test,--"
1211,IV,These sped their thoughts and turned their hearts away
1212,IV,From sloth’s seductions and desire’s unrest.
1213,IV,
1214,IV,But Love was with them: no unchecked desires
1215,IV,"Or wandering fancies ever brought the thrill,"
1216,IV,"The joy in womanhood, that lit love’s fires"
1217,IV,In these of the clean blood and strengthened will.
1218,IV,
1219,IV,"For them love’s passion, when it found its rest,"
1220,IV,"Glowed with a light no after-gloom could mar,"
1221,IV,Soft as the wild-rose glory in the west
1222,IV,"That, fading, lifts the veil that hides a star."

1227,IN THE WORLD,IN THE WORLD
1228,IN THE WORLD,
1229,IN THE WORLD,
1230,IN THE WORLD,Is this the world we sought? Is this our dream
1231,IN THE WORLD,Of life’s warm heart; and yon divided host!
1232,IN THE WORLD,Is that the camp that marks the latest stage
1233,IN THE WORLD,On man’s adventurous quest? Full well we knew
1234,IN THE WORLD,That we had left behind the peace that dwells
1235,IN THE WORLD,"In quiet woodland ways. Yes, for we dreamed"
1236,IN THE WORLD,"Of danger and of strife, of sorrow and sin;"
1237,IN THE WORLD,But always in our dream a battle song
1238,IN THE WORLD,"Called us to fields unwon, and evermore,"
1239,IN THE WORLD,"Above the failure and the sacrifice,"
1240,IN THE WORLD,We heard the voice of hope that told the world
1241,IN THE WORLD,It laboured not in vain. Is this that world?
1242,IN THE WORLD,This the great comrade host? Our eyes are dim;
1243,IN THE WORLD,"For we have seen the saddest sight on earth,--"
1244,IN THE WORLD,Her faithless millions.
1245,IN THE WORLD,"Toil and strife and sin,"
1246,IN THE WORLD,Pity and love we see; but what that speaks
1247,IN THE WORLD,Of man’s belief in a great destiny?
1248,IN THE WORLD,What symbol shines before us? Not the sword!--
1249,IN THE WORLD,The noble cause unsheaths it not: we fight
1250,IN THE WORLD,"Not to save others, nay, we hardly dare"
1251,IN THE WORLD,To fight to save our honour or ourselves.
1252,IN THE WORLD,"The cross? It stands aloft on spire and dome,"
1253,IN THE WORLD,"An ornament above the empty church,"
1254,IN THE WORLD,While underneath it in the market-place
1255,IN THE WORLD,"We kneel, we bow before the Belly-god."
1256,IN THE WORLD,He is our own! Behold we fashioned him!
1257,IN THE WORLD,"We fattened him, as bees create their queen,"
1258,IN THE WORLD,"Shaped him with our inventions, in his frame"
1259,IN THE WORLD,Ordered blind forces to mechanic law.
1260,IN THE WORLD,But lo! his breath is but an engine throb;
1261,IN THE WORLD,"He knows not love nor ruth; he has no soul,--"
1262,IN THE WORLD,"This idol in our midst, our Belly-god."
1263,IN THE WORLD,"He offers us the substance of the known,"
1264,IN THE WORLD,"He asks no faith in the unseen, he prompts"
1265,IN THE WORLD,No sacrifice that earns not its reward.
1266,IN THE WORLD,"Comfort and wealth he promises to man,"
1267,IN THE WORLD,He shows the poor the gold he gave the rich
1268,IN THE WORLD,"And bids them take it, and the rich he arms"
1269,IN THE WORLD,Against the poor.
1270,IN THE WORLD,How different a world
1271,IN THE WORLD,"From that we pictured, when we watched the dawn"
1272,IN THE WORLD,Break on the blue horizon of the hills
1273,IN THE WORLD,"That ringed our quiet homeland, and we dwelt"
1274,IN THE WORLD,Among the scattered friendly folk. Our dreams
1275,IN THE WORLD,"Then told us of profounder tides of life,"
1276,IN THE WORLD,"Nobler activities, more glorious tasks,"
1277,IN THE WORLD,Born of the strength of numbers; now we see
1278,IN THE WORLD,"Weakness, not strength, in numbers, where no cause,"
1279,IN THE WORLD,No common faith unites them; now we hear
1280,IN THE WORLD,The sound of the great moving multitude
1281,IN THE WORLD,"That marches without goal or leader, nay,"
1282,IN THE WORLD,"That marches not, but spreads."
1283,IN THE WORLD,What profits it
1284,IN THE WORLD,That man shall gain the world and lose his soul?
1285,IN THE WORLD,What that he conquer nature and enslave
1286,IN THE WORLD,"Her forces, if he stands himself a slave"
1287,IN THE WORLD,Ruled by his own inventions? What that bread
1288,IN THE WORLD,"Be cheaper to the poor, if life itself"
1289,IN THE WORLD,"Have lost its savour, and the daily toil"
1290,IN THE WORLD,"Grown so mechanical, themselves become"
1291,IN THE WORLD,But parts of the machine they tend? ’Twere well
1292,IN THE WORLD,If they could see in this dull servitude
1293,IN THE WORLD,"Some noble purpose, or behold at last"
1294,IN THE WORLD,Its help to the world; but they discern no end
1295,IN THE WORLD,"Save riches gathered, and the luxury"
1296,IN THE WORLD,They envy but can never hope to share.
1297,IN THE WORLD,What have we gained in welfare to atone
1298,IN THE WORLD,For beauty lost? This spreading human mass
1299,IN THE WORLD,"Has marred earth’s lovely ways with steam and oil,"
1300,IN THE WORLD,And soon will desecrate the paths of heaven
1301,IN THE WORLD,With loud excursions. Soon the earth will keep
1302,IN THE WORLD,"No hiding-place for Pan, no solitude"
1303,IN THE WORLD,"Among the hills, no cloisters of the woods."
1304,IN THE WORLD,And what of that if Nature’s loveliness
1305,IN THE WORLD,Were but a sacrifice? if for that loss
1306,IN THE WORLD,The world had gained new joy? if the wild charm
1307,IN THE WORLD,"Of solitude, the beauty that the feet"
1308,IN THE WORLD,"Of men destroy had passed into their souls,"
1309,IN THE WORLD,And gave the weary toilers of the town
1310,IN THE WORLD,New hope? But no! the beauty we destroy
1311,IN THE WORLD,Leaves us no child behind: humanity
1312,IN THE WORLD,"Is robbed for ever; and the poor, for whom"
1313,IN THE WORLD,"Beauty was the one priceless thing on earth,"
1314,IN THE WORLD,"Save love, that without payment was their own,--"
1315,IN THE WORLD,They are the most bereft.
1316,IN THE WORLD,How shall we stay
1317,IN THE WORLD,"This thing called progress, this machinery"
1318,IN THE WORLD,"Fashioned by man to drive and crush himself,"
1319,IN THE WORLD,"This crafty servant of the Belly-god,"
1320,IN THE WORLD,That multiplies our wealth and starves our souls?
1321,IN THE WORLD,Was it for this vile servitude that man
1322,IN THE WORLD,Contended through the ages with the powers
1323,IN THE WORLD,"Of darkness, till at last he saw the star"
1324,IN THE WORLD,Of Freedom shining on his onward way?
1325,IN THE WORLD,"Out of that vast contention, from that Hell"
1326,IN THE WORLD,Of suffering and sacrifice at last
1327,IN THE WORLD,"Rising victorious, the victory"
1328,IN THE WORLD,"Should be indeed heroic, and the goal"
1329,IN THE WORLD,Beyond it something nobler than the quest
1330,IN THE WORLD,"Of treasure upon earth;--ay, though that wealth"
1331,IN THE WORLD,"Be subdivided, and mankind become"
1332,IN THE WORLD,A brotherhood of prosperous shareholders.
1333,IN THE WORLD,
1334,IN THE WORLD,This is the world! Our dream of life’s warm heart
1335,IN THE WORLD,"Beating with greater purposes, and fired"
1336,IN THE WORLD,"With nobler aims, where the great companies"
1337,IN THE WORLD,Of men are gathered:--all is unfulfilled;
1338,IN THE WORLD,And yet our dream lives on!
1339,IN THE WORLD,"Oh, cherish it!"
1340,IN THE WORLD,’Twas given us to guard: ’tis the design
1341,IN THE WORLD,"Of the Eternal Architect, revealed"
1342,IN THE WORLD,To earthly toilers; and ’tis not for man
1343,IN THE WORLD,"To shape his dreams to fit the world he finds,"
1344,IN THE WORLD,But to rebuild the world to fit his dreams.
1345,IN THE WORLD,
1346,IN THE WORLD,"What of ourselves, who looking on the world"
1347,IN THE WORLD,Condemn its faithlessness? How weak indeed
1348,IN THE WORLD,Must be our own faith if our hope for man
1349,IN THE WORLD,Fails because here the march is retrograde
1350,IN THE WORLD,And there the goal is hidden. We have mourned
1351,IN THE WORLD,"Beauty deflowered, and paths of old romance"
1352,IN THE WORLD,Trodden to dust; but we remembered not
1353,IN THE WORLD,"The waste reclaimed, the pestilential swamp"
1354,IN THE WORLD,Drained of its poison. While in vain we sought
1355,IN THE WORLD,The faith that led the old world’s pioneers
1356,IN THE WORLD,"Through desert places, we forget that Hell"
1357,IN THE WORLD,"Of superstition, bigotry, and fear"
1358,IN THE WORLD,"That tortured countless souls, that bondage vile"
1359,IN THE WORLD,From which the world has freed itself at last.
1360,IN THE WORLD,Foul things that never shall be seen again
1361,IN THE WORLD,"Have been uprooted; but the beautiful,"
1362,IN THE WORLD,"The old and lovely things that now are not,--"
1363,IN THE WORLD,"These are not dead, but in our dreams they hide,"
1364,IN THE WORLD,Till love shall charm them back into the world.
1365,IN THE WORLD,
1366,IN THE WORLD,’Tis man’s to build; our dream shows God’s design:
1367,IN THE WORLD,"The misinterpretation of our dream,"
1368,IN THE WORLD,"Our faithlessness, is written in the world;"
1369,IN THE WORLD,But still the dream remains;--’tis born again
1370,IN THE WORLD,With every child that comes from the unknown
1371,IN THE WORLD,Into our mortal life. ’Twas not for us
1372,IN THE WORLD,"To look for the fulfilment of our dream,"
1373,IN THE WORLD,Or find our heart’s desire upon the earth:
1374,IN THE WORLD,"But it is ours to labour; ay, ’tis ours"
1375,IN THE WORLD,Into our labour to translate our dreams.
1376,IN THE WORLD,
1377,IN THE WORLD,"Come! for our labour calls us to the world,--"
1378,IN THE WORLD,The world that bows before the Belly-god
1379,IN THE WORLD,To whom men sacrifice their dreams divine
1380,IN THE WORLD,For meats that perish. Are they satisfied?
1381,IN THE WORLD,"Are they not crying, Give us back our dreams?"
1382,IN THE WORLD,Come! ’tis for those who have not sold their dreams
1383,IN THE WORLD,To stand together and to lead the world.

1408,HEARTH LIGHT,The winter sound of wind and rain
1409,HEARTH LIGHT,"That filled the land on evenings drear,"

1411,HEARTH LIGHT,That hearth whose light has since out-flowed
1412,HEARTH LIGHT,"On every dark and wintry road,--"
1413,HEARTH LIGHT,Whose memory has come to raise
1414,HEARTH LIGHT,"A shelter round our homeless days,"
1415,HEARTH LIGHT,And brought us on our unknown quest

1422,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1423,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1424,THE TEST OF FAITH,We had no need of faith in those young days
1425,THE TEST OF FAITH,"When we went forth on the world’s unknown ways,"
1426,THE TEST OF FAITH,"When joy from every fount of life welled out,"
1427,THE TEST OF FAITH,And beauty over-ran its crystal springs.
1428,THE TEST OF FAITH,We could not ask if life were good or ill
1429,THE TEST OF FAITH,"When all our dreams it promised to fulfil,"
1430,THE TEST OF FAITH,"We could not fear the unknown road, nor doubt"

1433,THE TEST OF FAITH,"All is the same, all but ourselves, and we!"
1434,THE TEST OF FAITH,Do our eyes fail or but too clearly see?

1437,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Was it then but a vision we beheld,"
1438,THE TEST OF FAITH,"And but our youthful spirits that out-welled,"
1439,THE TEST OF FAITH,"That now the fountain is an unfilled cup,"
1440,THE TEST OF FAITH,And where we looked for harvest there is dearth?
1441,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1442,THE TEST OF FAITH,"We know not when our faith began to wane,"
1443,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Or whether ’twas the sight of wrong and pain,"
1444,THE TEST OF FAITH,The knowledge of a world wherein the strong
1445,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Preyed on the weak, that wakened our distrust;"
1446,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Whether it was the torture that we saw,"
1447,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Dealt in obedience to Nature’s law,"
1448,THE TEST OF FAITH,That made us ask if such a world of wrong
1449,THE TEST OF FAITH,From dust evolved should not return to dust.
1450,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1451,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Was God, we asked, the shaper of that plan"
1452,THE TEST OF FAITH,Of brutal strife from which the soul of man
1453,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Emerged? could man, a creature born of earth,"
1454,THE TEST OF FAITH,Find beyond earth a place to house his soul?
1455,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Or was it all a pattern chance had traced,"
1456,THE TEST OF FAITH,A pattern that would be again erased;
1457,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Were strife, and wrong, and love, and death, and birth,"
1458,THE TEST OF FAITH,But motions of a force without a goal?
1459,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1460,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Give us, we cry, a pilgrimage of pain,"
1461,THE TEST OF FAITH,"However long, so it be not in vain!"
1462,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Show us a task, however desperate,"
1463,THE TEST OF FAITH,So that our labour be not all for nought!
1464,THE TEST OF FAITH,"We would not mourn a lot, however hard,"
1465,THE TEST OF FAITH,If we were sure we had a trust to guard;
1466,THE TEST OF FAITH,"We could fight on, careless of our own fate,"
1467,THE TEST OF FAITH,If we were sure that not in vain we fought.
1468,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1469,THE TEST OF FAITH,"But we have looked upon the ants and bees,"
1470,THE TEST OF FAITH,"And asked ourselves if we be more than these,"
1471,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Who haply find their sunlit hours sweet,"
1472,THE TEST OF FAITH,And for their common weal their lives lay down.
1473,THE TEST OF FAITH,We! we who claim to be the Lord’s elect;
1474,THE TEST OF FAITH,"We! we the vile, the outcast, and the wrecked;"
1475,THE TEST OF FAITH,We! the gay rabble of a Paris street;
1476,THE TEST OF FAITH,We! the low millions of a Chinese town.
1477,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1478,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Then, in disdain of all the shame and strife,"
1479,THE TEST OF FAITH,We wish no more to be a part of life.
1480,THE TEST OF FAITH,The vital force that we miscalled a soul
1481,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Ebbs, and our feet grow weary; we would rest."
1482,THE TEST OF FAITH,Since toil and sacrifice can but avail
1483,THE TEST OF FAITH,"To nurse a hope that in the end must fail,"
1484,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Better, we cry, the graveyard for a goal"
1485,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Than any further hopeless, aimless quest."

1488,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1489,THE TEST OF FAITH,Now is the test of faith: there was no room
1490,THE TEST OF FAITH,"For faith when life put forth its vernal bloom,"
1491,THE TEST OF FAITH,And brave adventures promised to fulfil
1492,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Our dreams, and danger made us long to prove"
1493,THE TEST OF FAITH,Our fighting strength; but now that we have spent
1494,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Our treasure and beheld our punishment,"
1495,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Oh! now, when we already feel the chill"
1496,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Of death, and hear the passing bell of love,"
1497,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1498,THE TEST OF FAITH,Now while the laws no deeds nor prayers can move
1499,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Bear witness against all we long to prove,"
1500,THE TEST OF FAITH,Now is the test of faith:--still to be true
1501,THE TEST OF FAITH,To those great purposes our dreams have shown;
1502,THE TEST OF FAITH,"And, as a son defends a mother’s name"
1503,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Although a thousand voices cry her shame,"
1504,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Because he knows the heart they never knew,"
1505,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Still, still to trust the life whence springs our own."
1506,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1507,THE TEST OF FAITH,"We have beheld the evil and the good,"
1508,THE TEST OF FAITH,"And know, ourselves, the strength of wrong withstood."
1509,THE TEST OF FAITH,May it not be that God is everywhere
1510,THE TEST OF FAITH,Striving Himself against eternal wrong?
1511,THE TEST OF FAITH,May it not be that on that battle-field
1512,THE TEST OF FAITH,He needs the help of those His love would shield?
1513,THE TEST OF FAITH,May not His arm be bound by our despair?
1514,THE TEST OF FAITH,May not our courage help to make it strong?
1515,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1516,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Come! ere strength fail us, be it ours to guard"
1517,THE TEST OF FAITH,"That good which now can be upheld or marred,--"
1518,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Tending, it may be, in our earth-born dust,"
1519,THE TEST OF FAITH,The mortal seed of some immortal bloom.
1520,THE TEST OF FAITH,Come! can we dare to pause or hesitate
1521,THE TEST OF FAITH,"When we may be the conquerors of fate,--"
1522,THE TEST OF FAITH,When fighting on God’s side for life’s great trust
1523,THE TEST OF FAITH,Our victory may break the bonds of doom?
1524,THE TEST OF FAITH,
1525,THE TEST OF FAITH,"And if no hope appears, yet having seen"
1526,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Dreams of what should be and what might have been,--"
1527,THE TEST OF FAITH,"If as a crippled battle-ship that sinks,"
1528,THE TEST OF FAITH,"Flying her fighting colours to the fleet,"
1529,THE TEST OF FAITH,"We face the end,--is there no fountain-head"
1530,THE TEST OF FAITH,Of strength divine from which such strength is fed?
1531,THE TEST OF FAITH,Must not our lives be bound with unseen links
1532,THE TEST OF FAITH,To some great heart that cannot know defeat.

1563,A RUINED CHAPEL,
1564,A RUINED CHAPEL,"A few stones piled together long ago,"
1565,A RUINED CHAPEL,"And fallen again to ruin, have a charm"
1566,A RUINED CHAPEL,To hallow all the world. The sweetest sounds
1567,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Are those most near akin to silences,"
1568,A RUINED CHAPEL,Such as sea whispers rippling at the prow
1569,A RUINED CHAPEL,"When the loud engine ceases, muffled bells,"
1570,A RUINED CHAPEL,Or wandering waves of dying harmony
1571,A RUINED CHAPEL,In echoing minsters; and the sweetest notes
1572,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Of Life are those that reach us from afar,--"
1573,A RUINED CHAPEL,Those wafted whispers of humanity
1574,A RUINED CHAPEL,"And Love and Death, that none can ever hear"
1575,A RUINED CHAPEL,Amid the mighty voices of the world.
1576,A RUINED CHAPEL,This is a little spot of neutral ground
1577,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Beside the pilgrim road, between the world"
1578,A RUINED CHAPEL,We know of and the world of which we dream.
1579,A RUINED CHAPEL,The summer wind that blows outside and bends
1580,A RUINED CHAPEL,The flowers that grow upon the chancel wall
1581,A RUINED CHAPEL,Sounds far away; the sunbeams falling here
1582,A RUINED CHAPEL,Look other than the common light that floods
1583,A RUINED CHAPEL,"The meadowlands beyond, and overhead"
1584,A RUINED CHAPEL,The roof of noonday sky is all its own.
1585,A RUINED CHAPEL,The story written now upon these walls
1586,A RUINED CHAPEL,Is not of scenes in long forgotten hours:
1587,A RUINED CHAPEL,Another meaning and another life
1588,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Which keeps that past within it, as a tree"
1589,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Hides vanished sunlight, has outlived the old:"
1590,A RUINED CHAPEL,"These ruins hold our hearts, not theirs who built."
1591,A RUINED CHAPEL,For though erewhile I fell into a dream
1592,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Of summer on a morning long ago,"
1593,A RUINED CHAPEL,Saw knightly men and noble ladies cross
1594,A RUINED CHAPEL,The sward of green and climb the winding stair
1595,A RUINED CHAPEL,And enter at the doorway one by one;
1596,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Though of their fellowship a while I seemed,"
1597,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Knelt there at matins, watched the sunlight fall"
1598,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Through the dim traceries, and stain the floor"
1599,A RUINED CHAPEL,"With rose and gold where now the grass is green,--"
1600,A RUINED CHAPEL,"I looked for something which I could not find,"
1601,A RUINED CHAPEL,"There was a want of something I had known,"
1602,A RUINED CHAPEL,"An emptiness at heart, as though all life"
1603,A RUINED CHAPEL,Had dwindled from its high significance.
1604,A RUINED CHAPEL,And soon the sound of the Gregorian
1605,A RUINED CHAPEL,Grew ghostly in my ears; the simpler faith
1606,A RUINED CHAPEL,My soul accepted in that former world
1607,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Was troubled, and once more the chapel walls"
1608,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Were ruined, and the infinite blue sky"
1609,A RUINED CHAPEL,Became a roof above the empty nave.
1610,A RUINED CHAPEL,"But lo! the wind, which was the same soft wind"
1611,A RUINED CHAPEL,"That roamed about the chapel walls of old,"
1612,A RUINED CHAPEL,Had gathered from the ages a new voice
1613,A RUINED CHAPEL,And breathed the soul of an unfathomed life;
1614,A RUINED CHAPEL,The skies were deeper; in the wayside flowers
1615,A RUINED CHAPEL,The beauty dreaming at the heart of things
1616,A RUINED CHAPEL,Seemed nearer than before; and in my heart
1617,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Beat the strong pulses of the larger hope,"
1618,A RUINED CHAPEL,"The grander sorrows, the sublimer wrongs,"
1619,A RUINED CHAPEL,"The nobler freedom and the truer love,"
1620,A RUINED CHAPEL,Which the great world has won upon its way
1621,A RUINED CHAPEL,And learned from century to century.
1622,A RUINED CHAPEL,
1623,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Nay! from our world we cannot long escape,--"
1624,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Its voices are around me, even here"
1625,A RUINED CHAPEL,Within the ruined cloisters of the past;
1626,A RUINED CHAPEL,But here to pilgrim wayfarers they sound
1627,A RUINED CHAPEL,"No longer clamorous and harsh, but met"
1628,A RUINED CHAPEL,By dreams of the eternal and unknown
1629,A RUINED CHAPEL,"They make a whispered music in our ears,--"
1630,A RUINED CHAPEL,Even as sea-tides flowing up the stream
1631,A RUINED CHAPEL,"Meet the strong rapids breaking among rocks,"
1632,A RUINED CHAPEL,And lull their tumult to a rippled song.

1639,NORTH AND SOUTH,
1640,NORTH AND SOUTH,In foam of rose the long waves broke below
1641,NORTH AND SOUTH,"The lemon trees, and gold and amethyst"
1642,NORTH AND SOUTH,The inland mountains gleamed.
1643,NORTH AND SOUTH,It was the land we dreamed of long ago;
1644,NORTH AND SOUTH,But now we looked on it we somewhere missed
1645,NORTH AND SOUTH,The light of which we dreamed.
1646,NORTH AND SOUTH,
1647,NORTH AND SOUTH,"Beside the oleander and the clove,"
1648,NORTH AND SOUTH,And alien midst many a flaming plant
1649,NORTH AND SOUTH,"Of gold and cinnabar,"
1650,NORTH AND SOUTH,Beyond the garden stood a black-green grove
1651,NORTH AND SOUTH,"Of pine-trees, set by some old emigrant"
1652,NORTH AND SOUTH,Who knew the polar star.
1653,NORTH AND SOUTH,
1654,NORTH AND SOUTH,The shadows deepened in that land unknown;
1655,NORTH AND SOUTH,And presently great stars appeared above
1656,NORTH AND SOUTH,In unfamiliar deeps.
1657,NORTH AND SOUTH,The wind’s voice and the water’s undertone
1658,NORTH AND SOUTH,Were soft as a forgotten touch of love
1659,NORTH AND SOUTH,That comes to one who sleeps.
1660,NORTH AND SOUTH,
1661,NORTH AND SOUTH,The night began the garden scents to steal;
1662,NORTH AND SOUTH,"The sea grew silver in the rising moon,"
1663,NORTH AND SOUTH,And violet the sky.
1664,NORTH AND SOUTH,We looked on splendour that we did not feel;
1665,NORTH AND SOUTH,"Strange charms, to which our souls were not in tune,"
1666,NORTH AND SOUTH,Touched us and drifted by.
1667,NORTH AND SOUTH,
1668,NORTH AND SOUTH,Then the wind rose and from the pines drew forth
1669,NORTH AND SOUTH,"Ancestral whispers of their land of birth,--"
1670,NORTH AND SOUTH,Dark heath and stormy shore;
1671,NORTH AND SOUTH,And all the wistful magic of the north
1672,NORTH AND SOUTH,And all the old enchantment of the earth
1673,NORTH AND SOUTH,Enfolded us once more.
1674,NORTH AND SOUTH,
1675,NORTH AND SOUTH,The north interpreted the south: dreams dreamed
1676,NORTH AND SOUTH,"In childhood gave reality its soul,"
1677,NORTH AND SOUTH,And filled the earth again
1678,NORTH AND SOUTH,With vanished wonder; while far off I seemed
1679,NORTH AND SOUTH,To hear wild seas beyond a pine-wood roll
1680,NORTH AND SOUTH,At dusk in wind and rain.

1697,INTERPENETRATIONS,The sorrow borne on the wind’s song
1698,INTERPENETRATIONS,The note of a bird made sweet;

1700,INTERPENETRATIONS,Seemed written in blue and golden staves

1702,INTERPENETRATIONS,Secrets hid from the flowers of the field
1703,INTERPENETRATIONS,In the wandering wind we heard;

1705,INTERPENETRATIONS,"Of the wild flowers, gave us again the clue"

1707,INTERPENETRATIONS,And something the winds and seas forgot
1708,INTERPENETRATIONS,And the wild flowers left untold
1709,INTERPENETRATIONS,Lay dim in the rose of the twilight sky
1710,INTERPENETRATIONS,And shone in the starlight’s gold.

1838,FIRST PATHWAYS,"Its shelter was the kindest you have found,"
1839,FIRST PATHWAYS,Its pathways were the best.

1841,FIRST PATHWAYS,And even in the city’s smoke and mire

1843,FIRST PATHWAYS,"On those first paths, and that they also led"
1844,FIRST PATHWAYS,To lands of heart’s desire.
1845,FIRST PATHWAYS,
1846,FIRST PATHWAYS,"And where the children in dark alleys penned,"

1850,FIRST PATHWAYS,"Or where they gathered, dancing hand in hand,"
1851,FIRST PATHWAYS,"About the organ man, for them, too, lay"
1852,FIRST PATHWAYS,"Beyond the dismal alley’s entrance way,"
1853,FIRST PATHWAYS,The gates of wonderland.

1855,FIRST PATHWAYS,For ’tis my faith that Earth’s first words are sweet

1888,HIDDEN PATHS,"Elsewhere is your enchanted ground,"
