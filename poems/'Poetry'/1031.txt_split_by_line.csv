83,I.,
84,I.,"HE was a Grecian lad, who coming home"
85,I.,With pulpy figs and wine from Sicily
86,I.,"Stood at his galley’s prow, and let the foam"
87,I.,"Blow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,"
88,I.,And holding wave and wind in boy’s despite
89,I.,Peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night.
90,I.,
91,I.,Till with the dawn he saw a burnished spear
92,I.,"Like a thin thread of gold against the sky,"
93,I.,"And hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,"
94,I.,And bade the pilot head her lustily
95,I.,"Against the nor’west gale, and all day long"
96,I.,"Held on his way, and marked the rowers’ time with measured song."
97,I.,
98,I.,And when the faint Corinthian hills were red
99,I.,"Dropped anchor in a little sandy bay,"
100,I.,"And with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,"
101,I.,"And brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,"
102,I.,"And washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold"
103,I.,"Brought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,"
104,I.,
105,I.,And a rich robe stained with the fishers’ juice
106,I.,Which of some swarthy trader he had bought
107,I.,"Upon the sunny quay at Syracuse,"
108,I.,"And was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,"
109,I.,And by the questioning merchants made his way
110,I.,"Up through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day"
111,I.,
112,I.,"Had spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,"
113,I.,"Clomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet"
114,I.,Crept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd
115,I.,"Of busy priests, and from some dark retreat"
116,I.,Watched the young swains his frolic playmates bring
117,I.,"The firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling"
118,I.,
119,I.,"The crackling salt upon the flame, or hang"
120,I.,His studded crook against the temple wall
121,I.,To Her who keeps away the ravenous fang
122,I.,Of the base wolf from homestead and from stall;
123,I.,"And then the clear-voiced maidens ’gan to sing,"
124,I.,"And to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,"
125,I.,
126,I.,"A beechen cup brimming with milky foam,"
127,I.,A fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery
128,I.,"Of hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb"
129,I.,Dripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee
130,I.,"Had ceased from building, a black skin of oil"
131,I.,"Meet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked spoil"
132,I.,
133,I.,Stolen from Artemis that jealous maid
134,I.,"To please Athena, and the dappled hide"
135,I.,Of a tall stag who in some mountain glade
136,I.,"Had met the shaft; and then the herald cried,"
137,I.,And from the pillared precinct one by one
138,I.,Went the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had
139,I.,done.
140,I.,
141,I.,And the old priest put out the waning fires
142,I.,Save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed
143,I.,"For ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres"
144,I.,"Came fainter on the wind, as down the road"
145,I.,"In joyous dance these country folk did pass,"
146,I.,And with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.
147,I.,
148,I.,"Long time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,"
149,I.,"And heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,"
150,I.,And the rose-petals falling from the wreath
151,I.,"As the night breezes wandered through the shrine,"
152,I.,And seemed to be in some entrancèd swoon
153,I.,Till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon
154,I.,
155,I.,"Flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,"
156,I.,"When from his nook up leapt the venturous lad,"
157,I.,And flinging wide the cedar-carven door
158,I.,Beheld an awful image saffron-clad
159,I.,And armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared
160,I.,"From the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared"
161,I.,
162,I.,"Like a red rod of flame, stony and steeled"
163,I.,"The Gorgon’s head its leaden eyeballs rolled,"
164,I.,"And writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,"
165,I.,And gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold
166,I.,"In passion impotent, while with blind gaze"
167,I.,The blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.
168,I.,
169,I.,The lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp
170,I.,"Far out at sea off Sunium, or cast"
171,I.,"The net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp"
172,I.,"Of horses smite the waves, and a wild blast"
173,I.,"Divide the folded curtains of the night,"
174,I.,"And knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright."
175,I.,
176,I.,And guilty lovers in their venery
177,I.,"Forgat a little while their stolen sweets,"
178,I.,Deeming they heard dread Dian’s bitter cry;
179,I.,And the grim watchmen on their lofty seats
180,I.,"Ran to their shields in haste precipitate,"
181,I.,Or strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.
182,I.,
183,I.,"For round the temple rolled the clang of arms,"
184,I.,"And the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,"
185,I.,And the air quaked with dissonant alarums
186,I.,"Till huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,"
187,I.,"And on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,"
188,I.,And the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.
189,I.,
190,I.,"Ready for death with parted lips he stood,"
191,I.,And well content at such a price to see
192,I.,"That calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,"
193,I.,"The marvel of that pitiless chastity,"
194,I.,"Ah! well content indeed, for never wight"
195,I.,Since Troy’s young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.
196,I.,
197,I.,"Ready for death he stood, but lo! the air"
198,I.,"Grew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,"
199,I.,"And off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,"
200,I.,And from his limbs he throw the cloak away;
201,I.,For whom would not such love make desperate?
202,I.,"And nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate"
203,I.,
204,I.,"Undid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,"
205,I.,"And bared the breasts of polished ivory,"
206,I.,Till from the waist the peplos falling down
207,I.,Left visible the secret mystery
208,I.,"Which to no lover will Athena show,"
209,I.,"The grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of snow."
210,I.,
211,I.,Those who have never known a lover’s sin
212,I.,"Let them not read my ditty, it will be"
213,I.,To their dull ears so musicless and thin
214,I.,"That they will have no joy of it, but ye"
215,I.,"To whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,"
216,I.,"Ye who have learned who Eros is,—O listen yet awhile."
217,I.,
218,I.,A little space he let his greedy eyes
219,I.,"Rest on the burnished image, till mere sight"
220,I.,"Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,"
221,I.,And then his lips in hungering delight
222,I.,"Fed on her lips, and round the towered neck"
223,I.,"He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion’s will to check."
224,I.,
225,I.,"Never I ween did lover hold such tryst,"
226,I.,"For all night long he murmured honeyed word,"
227,I.,"And saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed"
228,I.,"Her pale and argent body undisturbed,"
229,I.,"And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed"
230,I.,His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.
231,I.,
232,I.,It was as if Numidian javelins
233,I.,"Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,"
234,I.,And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins
235,I.,"In exquisite pulsation, and the pain"
236,I.,Was such sweet anguish that he never drew
237,I.,His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.
238,I.,
239,I.,They who have never seen the daylight peer
240,I.,"Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,"
241,I.,And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear
242,I.,"And worshipped body risen, they for certain"
243,I.,"Will never know of what I try to sing,"
244,I.,"How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering."
245,I.,
246,I.,"The moon was girdled with a crystal rim,"
247,I.,The sign which shipmen say is ominous
248,I.,"Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,"
249,I.,And the low lightening east was tremulous
250,I.,"With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,"
251,I.,Ere from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.
252,I.,
253,I.,Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast
254,I.,"Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,"
255,I.,"And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,"
256,I.,And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran
257,I.,Like a young fawn unto an olive wood
258,I.,Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;
259,I.,
260,I.,"And sought a little stream, which well he knew,"
261,I.,For oftentimes with boyish careless shout
262,I.,"The green and crested grebe he would pursue,"
263,I.,"Or snare in woven net the silver trout,"
264,I.,And down amid the startled reeds he lay
265,I.,"Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day."
266,I.,
267,I.,"On the green bank he lay, and let one hand"
268,I.,"Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,"
269,I.,And soon the breath of morning came and fanned
270,I.,"His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly"
271,I.,"The tangled curls from off his forehead, while"
272,I.,He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.
273,I.,
274,I.,And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak
275,I.,"With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,"
276,I.,And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke
277,I.,"Curled through the air across the ripening oats,"
278,I.,And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed
279,I.,As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.
280,I.,
281,I.,And when the light-foot mower went afield
282,I.,"Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,"
283,I.,"And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,"
284,I.,"And from its nest the waking corncrake flew,"
285,I.,Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream
286,I.,"And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,"
287,I.,
288,I.,"Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,"
289,I.,"‘It is young Hylas, that false runaway"
290,I.,Who with a Naiad now would make his bed
291,I.,"Forgetting Herakles,’ but others, ‘Nay,"
292,I.,"It is Narcissus, his own paramour,"
293,I.,Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.’
294,I.,
295,I.,"And when they nearer came a third one cried,"
296,I.,‘It is young Dionysos who has hid
297,I.,His spear and fawnskin by the river side
298,I.,"Weary of hunting with the Bassarid,"
299,I.,And wise indeed were we away to fly:
300,I.,They live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.’
301,I.,
302,I.,"So turned they back, and feared to look behind,"
303,I.,And told the timid swain how they had seen
304,I.,"Amid the reeds some woodland god reclined,"
305,I.,"And no man dared to cross the open green,"
306,I.,"And on that day no olive-tree was slain,"
307,I.,"Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,"
308,I.,
309,I.,"Save when the neat-herd’s lad, his empty pail"
310,I.,"Well slung upon his back, with leap and bound"
311,I.,"Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail,"
312,I.,"Hoping that he some comrade new had found,"
313,I.,"And gat no answer, and then half afraid"
314,I.,"Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade"
315,I.,
316,I.,"A little girl ran laughing from the farm,"
317,I.,"Not thinking of love’s secret mysteries,"
318,I.,And when she saw the white and gleaming arm
319,I.,"And all his manlihood, with longing eyes"
320,I.,Whose passion mocked her sweet virginity
321,I.,"Watched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily."
322,I.,
323,I.,"Far off he heard the city’s hum and noise,"
324,I.,And now and then the shriller laughter where
325,I.,The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys
326,I.,"Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,"
327,I.,And now and then a little tinkling bell
328,I.,As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.
329,I.,
330,I.,"Through the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,"
331,I.,"The grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,"
332,I.,In sleek and oily coat the water-rat
333,I.,Breasting the little ripples manfully
334,I.,"Made for the wild-duck’s nest, from bough to bough"
335,I.,"Hopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the slough."
336,I.,
337,I.,On the faint wind floated the silky seeds
338,I.,"As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,"
339,I.,The ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds
340,I.,"And flecked with silver whorls the forest’s glass,"
341,I.,Which scarce had caught again its imagery
342,I.,Ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.
343,I.,
344,I.,But little care had he for any thing
345,I.,"Though up and down the beech the squirrel played,"
346,I.,And from the copse the linnet ’gan to sing
347,I.,To its brown mate its sweetest serenade;
348,I.,"Ah! little care indeed, for he had seen"
349,I.,The breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.
350,I.,
351,I.,But when the herdsman called his straggling goats
352,I.,"With whistling pipe across the rocky road,"
353,I.,And the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes
354,I.,"Boomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode"
355,I.,"Of coming storm, and the belated crane"
356,I.,"Passed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain"
357,I.,
358,I.,"Fell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,"
359,I.,And from the gloomy forest went his way
360,I.,"Past sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,"
361,I.,"And came at last unto a little quay,"
362,I.,"And called his mates aboard, and took his seat"
363,I.,"On the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping sheet,"
364,I.,
365,I.,"And steered across the bay, and when nine suns"
366,I.,"Passed down the long and laddered way of gold,"
367,I.,And nine pale moons had breathed their orisons
368,I.,"To the chaste stars their confessors, or told"
369,I.,Their dearest secret to the downy moth
370,I.,"That will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth"
371,I.,
372,I.,Came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes
373,I.,"And lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked"
374,I.,As though the lading of three argosies
375,I.,"Were in the hold, and flapped its wings and shrieked,"
376,I.,"And darkness straightway stole across the deep,"
377,I.,"Sheathed was Orion’s sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,"
378,I.,
379,I.,And the moon hid behind a tawny mask
380,I.,"Of drifting cloud, and from the ocean’s marge"
381,I.,"Rose the red plume, the huge and hornèd casque,"
382,I.,"The seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!"
383,I.,And clad in bright and burnished panoply
384,I.,Athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!
385,I.,
386,I.,To the dull sailors’ sight her loosened looks
387,I.,"Seemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet"
388,I.,"Only the spume that floats on hidden rocks,"
389,I.,"And, marking how the rising waters beat"
390,I.,"Against the rolling ship, the pilot cried"
391,I.,To the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side
392,I.,
393,I.,"But he, the overbold adulterer,"
394,I.,"A dear profaner of great mysteries,"
395,I.,"An ardent amorous idolater,"
396,I.,When he beheld those grand relentless eyes
397,I.,"Laughed loud for joy, and crying out ‘I come’"
398,I.,Leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.
399,I.,
400,I.,"Then fell from the high heaven one bright star,"
401,I.,"One dancer left the circling galaxy,"
402,I.,And back to Athens on her clattering car
403,I.,In all the pride of venged divinity
404,I.,"Pale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,"
405,I.,And a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.
406,I.,
407,I.,And the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew
408,I.,"With mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,"
409,I.,And the old pilot bade the trembling crew
410,I.,"Hoist the big sail, and told how he had seen"
411,I.,"Close to the stern a dim and giant form,"
412,I.,And like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.
413,I.,
414,I.,And no man dared to speak of Charmides
415,I.,"Deeming that he some evil thing had wrought,"
416,I.,And when they reached the strait Symplegades
417,I.,"They beached their galley on the shore, and sought"
418,I.,"The toll-gate of the city hastily,"
419,I.,And in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.
420,I.,
421,II.,II.
422,II.,
423,II.,"BUT some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare"
424,II.,"The boy’s drowned body back to Grecian land,"
425,II.,And mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair
426,II.,"And smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand;"
427,II.,"Some brought sweet spices from far Araby,"
428,II.,And others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.
429,II.,
430,II.,"And when he neared his old Athenian home,"
431,II.,A mighty billow rose up suddenly
432,II.,Upon whose oily back the clotted foam
433,II.,"Lay diapered in some strange fantasy,"
434,II.,And clasping him unto its glassy breast
435,II.,"Swept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!"
436,II.,
437,II.,Now where Colonos leans unto the sea
438,II.,There lies a long and level stretch of lawn;
439,II.,"The rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee"
440,II.,"For it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun"
441,II.,"Is not afraid, for never through the day"
442,II.,Comes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.
443,II.,
444,II.,But often from the thorny labyrinth
445,II.,And tangled branches of the circling wood
446,II.,The stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth
447,II.,"Hurling the polished disk, and draws his hood"
448,II.,"Over his guilty gaze, and creeps away,"
449,II.,"Nor dares to wind his horn, or—else at the first break of day"
450,II.,
451,II.,The Dryads come and throw the leathern ball
452,II.,"Along the reedy shore, and circumvent"
453,II.,Some goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal
454,II.,"For fear of bold Poseidon’s ravishment,"
455,II.,"And loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,"
456,II.,Lest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.
457,II.,
458,II.,"On this side and on that a rocky cave,"
459,II.,"Hung with the yellow-belled laburnum, stands"
460,II.,"Smooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave"
461,II.,"Leaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,"
462,II.,As though it feared to be too soon forgot
463,II.,"By the green rush, its playfellow,—and yet, it is a spot"
464,II.,
465,II.,"So small, that the inconstant butterfly"
466,II.,Could steal the hoarded money from each flower
467,II.,"Ere it was noon, and still not satisfy"
468,II.,"Its over-greedy love,—within an hour"
469,II.,"A sailor boy, were he but rude enow"
470,II.,"To land and pluck a garland for his galley’s painted prow,"
471,II.,
472,II.,"Would almost leave the little meadow bare,"
473,II.,"For it knows nothing of great pageantry,"
474,II.,Only a few narcissi here and there
475,II.,"Stand separate in sweet austerity,"
476,II.,"Dotting the unmown grass with silver stars,"
477,II.,And here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars.
478,II.,
479,II.,"Hither the billow brought him, and was glad"
480,II.,"Of such dear servitude, and where the land"
481,II.,Was virgin of all waters laid the lad
482,II.,"Upon the golden margent of the strand,"
483,II.,And like a lingering lover oft returned
484,II.,"To kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,"
485,II.,
486,II.,"Ere the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,"
487,II.,"That self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,"
488,II.,Ere grisly death with chill and nipping frost
489,II.,Had withered up those lilies white and red
490,II.,"Which, while the boy would through the forest range,"
491,II.,Answered each other in a sweet antiphonal counter-change.
492,II.,
493,II.,"And when at dawn the wood-nymphs, hand-in-hand,"
494,II.,"Threaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied"
495,II.,"The boy’s pale body stretched upon the sand,"
496,II.,"And feared Poseidon’s treachery, and cried,"
497,II.,And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade
498,II.,Each startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.
499,II.,
500,II.,"Save one white girl, who deemed it would not be"
501,II.,So dread a thing to feel a sea-god’s arms
502,II.,"Crushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,"
503,II.,And longed to listen to those subtle charms
504,II.,Insidious lovers weave when they would win
505,II.,"Some fencèd fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin"
506,II.,
507,II.,"To yield her treasure unto one so fair,"
508,II.,"And lay beside him, thirsty with love’s drouth,"
509,II.,"Called him soft names, played with his tangled hair,"
510,II.,And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth
511,II.,"Afraid he might not wake, and then afraid"
512,II.,"Lest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,"
513,II.,
514,II.,"Returned to fresh assault, and all day long"
515,II.,"Sat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,"
516,II.,"And held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,"
517,II.,Then frowned to see how froward was the boy
518,II.,"Who would not with her maidenhood entwine,"
519,II.,Nor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine;
520,II.,
521,II.,"Nor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,"
522,II.,"But said, ‘He will awake, I know him well,"
523,II.,He will awake at evening when the sun
524,II.,Hangs his red shield on Corinth’s citadel;
525,II.,This sleep is but a cruel treachery
526,II.,"To make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea"
527,II.,
528,II.,Deeper than ever falls the fisher’s line
529,II.,"Already a huge Triton blows his horn,"
530,II.,And weaves a garland from the crystalline
531,II.,And drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn
532,II.,"The emerald pillars of our bridal bed,"
533,II.,"For sphered in foaming silver, and with coral crownèd head,"
534,II.,
535,II.,"We two will sit upon a throne of pearl,"
536,II.,"And a blue wave will be our canopy,"
537,II.,And at our feet the water-snakes will curl
538,II.,In all their amethystine panoply
539,II.,"Of diamonded mail, and we will mark"
540,II.,"The mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,"
541,II.,
542,II.,Vermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold
543,II.,"Like flakes of crimson light, and the great deep"
544,II.,"His glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,"
545,II.,And we will see the painted dolphins sleep
546,II.,Cradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks
547,II.,Where Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous flocks.
548,II.,
549,II.,And tremulous opal-hued anemones
550,II.,Will wave their purple fringes where we tread
551,II.,"Upon the mirrored floor, and argosies"
552,II.,Of fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread
553,II.,"The drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,"
554,II.,And honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.’
555,II.,
556,II.,But when that baffled Lord of War the Sun
557,II.,With gaudy pennon flying passed away
558,II.,"Into his brazen House, and one by one"
559,II.,The little yellow stars began to stray
560,II.,"Across the field of heaven, ah! then indeed"
561,II.,"She feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,"
562,II.,
563,II.,"And cried, ‘Awake, already the pale moon"
564,II.,"Washes the trees with silver, and the wave"
565,II.,"Creeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,"
566,II.,"The croaking frogs are out, and from the cave"
567,II.,"The nightjar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,"
568,II.,And the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky grass.
569,II.,
570,II.,"Nay, though thou art a god, be not so coy,"
571,II.,For in yon stream there is a little reed
572,II.,That often whispers how a lovely boy
573,II.,"Lay with her once upon a grassy mead,"
574,II.,Who when his cruel pleasure he had done
575,II.,Spread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.
576,II.,
577,II.,"Be not so coy, the laurel trembles still"
578,II.,"With great Apollo’s kisses, and the fir"
579,II.,Whose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill
580,II.,Hath many a tale of that bold ravisher
581,II.,"Whom men call Boreas, and I have seen"
582,II.,The mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar’s silvery sheen.
583,II.,
584,II.,"Even the jealous Naiads call me fair,"
585,II.,And every morn a young and ruddy swain
586,II.,"Woos me with apples and with locks of hair,"
587,II.,And seeks to soothe my virginal disdain
588,II.,By all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;
589,II.,But yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove
590,II.,
591,II.,"With little crimson feet, which with its store"
592,II.,Of seven spotted eggs the cruel lad
593,II.,Had stolen from the lofty sycamore
594,II.,"At daybreak, when her amorous comrade had"
595,II.,Flown off in search of berried juniper
596,II.,"Which most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager"
597,II.,
598,II.,"Of the blue grapes, hath not persistency"
599,II.,So constant as this simple shepherd-boy
600,II.,"For my poor lips, his joyous purity"
601,II.,And laughing sunny eyes might well decoy
602,II.,A Dryad from her oath to Artemis;
603,II.,"For very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss;"
604,II.,
605,II.,"His argent forehead, like a rising moon"
606,II.,"Over the dusky hills of meeting brows,"
607,II.,"Is crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon"
608,II.,Leads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse
609,II.,"For Cytheræa, the first silky down"
610,II.,"Fringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and brown;"
611,II.,
612,II.,"And he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds"
613,II.,"Of bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,"
614,II.,And many an earthen bowl of yellow curds
615,II.,Is in his homestead for the thievish fly
616,II.,"To swim and drown in, the pink clover mead"
617,II.,"Keeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed."
618,II.,
619,II.,And yet I love him not; it was for thee
620,II.,I kept my love; I knew that thou would’st come
621,II.,"To rid me of this pallid chastity,"
622,II.,Thou fairest flower of the flowerless foam
623,II.,"Of all the wide Ægean, brightest star"
624,II.,Of ocean’s azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!
625,II.,
626,II.,"I knew that thou would’st come, for when at first"
627,II.,"The dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of spring"
628,II.,Swelled in my green and tender bark or burst
629,II.,To myriad multitudinous blossoming
630,II.,Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons
631,II.,"That did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes’ rapturous tunes"
632,II.,
633,II.,"Startled the squirrel from its granary,"
634,II.,"And cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,"
635,II.,Through my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy
636,II.,"Crept like new wine, and every mossy vein"
637,II.,"Throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,"
638,II.,And the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem’s maidenhood.
639,II.,
640,II.,The trooping fawns at evening came and laid
641,II.,"Their cool black noses on my lowest boughs,"
642,II.,And on my topmost branch the blackbird made
643,II.,"A little nest of grasses for his spouse,"
644,II.,And now and then a twittering wren would light
645,II.,On a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight.
646,II.,
647,II.,"I was the Attic shepherd’s trysting place,"
648,II.,"Beneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,"
649,II.,And round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase
650,II.,"The timorous girl, till tired out with play"
651,II.,"She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,"
652,II.,"And turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful snare."
653,II.,
654,II.,Then come away unto my ambuscade
655,II.,Where clustering woodbine weaves a canopy
656,II.,"For amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade"
657,II.,Of Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify
658,II.,The dearest rites of love; there in the cool
659,II.,"And green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool,"
660,II.,
661,II.,"The ouzel’s haunt, the wild bee’s pasturage,"
662,II.,For round its rim great creamy lilies float
663,II.,"Through their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,"
664,II.,Each cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat
665,II.,"Steered by a dragon-fly,—be not afraid"
666,II.,"To leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place was made"
667,II.,
668,II.,"For lovers such as we; the Cyprian Queen,"
669,II.,"One arm around her boyish paramour,"
670,II.,"Strays often there at eve, and I have seen"
671,II.,The moon strip off her misty vestiture
672,II.,"For young Endymion’s eyes; be not afraid,"
673,II.,The panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.
674,II.,
675,II.,"Nay if thou will’st, back to the beating brine,"
676,II.,"Back to the boisterous billow let us go,"
677,II.,And walk all day beneath the hyaline
678,II.,"Huge vault of Neptune’s watery portico,"
679,II.,And watch the purple monsters of the deep
680,II.,"Sport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap."
681,II.,
682,II.,For if my mistress find me lying here
683,II.,"She will not ruth or gentle pity show,"
684,II.,"But lay her boar-spear down, and with austere"
685,II.,"Relentless fingers string the cornel bow,"
686,II.,"And draw the feathered notch against her breast,"
687,II.,"And loose the archèd cord; aye, even now upon the quest"
688,II.,
689,II.,"I hear her hurrying feet,—awake, awake,"
690,II.,Thou laggard in love’s battle! once at least
691,II.,"Let me drink deep of passion’s wine, and slake"
692,II.,My parchèd being with the nectarous feast
693,II.,"Which even gods affect!  O come, Love, come,"
694,II.,Still we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.’
695,II.,
696,II.,Scarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees
697,II.,"Shook, and the leaves divided, and the air"
698,II.,"Grew conscious of a god, and the grey seas"
699,II.,"Crawled backward, and a long and dismal blare"
700,II.,"Blew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,"
701,II.,And like a flame a barbèd reed flew whizzing down the glade.
702,II.,
703,II.,And where the little flowers of her breast
704,II.,"Just brake into their milky blossoming,"
705,II.,"This murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,"
706,II.,"Pierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,"
707,II.,"And ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,"
708,II.,"And dug a long red road, and cleft with wingèd death her heart."
709,II.,
710,II.,Sobbing her life out with a bitter cry
711,II.,"On the boy’s body fell the Dryad maid,"
712,II.,"Sobbing for incomplete virginity,"
713,II.,"And raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,"
714,II.,"And all the pain of things unsatisfied,"
715,II.,And the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing side.
716,II.,
717,II.,"Ah! pitiful it was to hear her moan,"
718,II.,And very pitiful to see her die
719,II.,"Ere she had yielded up her sweets, or known"
720,II.,"The joy of passion, that dread mystery"
721,II.,"Which not to know is not to live at all,"
722,II.,And yet to know is to be held in death’s most deadly thrall.
723,II.,
724,II.,"But as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,"
725,II.,Who with Adonis all night long had lain
726,II.,"Within some shepherd’s hut in Arcady,"
727,II.,On team of silver doves and gilded wain
728,II.,"Was journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar"
729,II.,"From mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,"
730,II.,
731,II.,"And when low down she spied the hapless pair,"
732,II.,"And heard the Oread’s faint despairing cry,"
733,II.,Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air
734,II.,"As though it were a viol, hastily"
735,II.,"She bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,"
736,II.,"And dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous"
737,II.,doom.
738,II.,
739,II.,For as a gardener turning back his head
740,II.,"To catch the last notes of the linnet, mows"
741,II.,"With careless scythe too near some flower bed,"
742,II.,"And cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,"
743,II.,And with the flower’s loosened loneliness
744,II.,Strews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness
745,II.,
746,II.,Driving his little flock along the mead
747,II.,"Treads down two daffodils, which side by aide"
748,II.,Have lured the lady-bird with yellow brede
749,II.,"And made the gaudy moth forget its pride,"
750,II.,Treads down their brimming golden chalices
751,II.,Under light feet which were not made for such rude ravages;
752,II.,
753,II.,Or as a schoolboy tired of his book
754,II.,Flings himself down upon the reedy grass
755,II.,"And plucks two water-lilies from the brook,"
756,II.,"And for a time forgets the hour glass,"
757,II.,"Then wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,"
758,II.,"And lets the hot sun kill them, even go these lovers lay."
759,II.,
760,II.,"And Venus cried, ‘It is dread Artemis"
761,II.,"Whose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,"
762,II.,Or else that mightier maid whose care it is
763,II.,To guard her strong and stainless majesty
764,II.,"Upon the hill Athenian,—alas!"
765,II.,That they who loved so well unloved into Death’s house should pass.’
766,II.,
767,II.,So with soft hands she laid the boy and girl
768,II.,In the great golden waggon tenderly
769,II.,(Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl
770,II.,Just threaded with a blue vein’s tapestry
771,II.,"Had not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast"
772,II.,Swayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest)
773,II.,
774,II.,"And then each pigeon spread its milky van,"
775,II.,"The bright car soared into the dawning sky,"
776,II.,And like a cloud the aerial caravan
777,II.,"Passed over the Ægean silently,"
778,II.,Till the faint air was troubled with the song
779,II.,From the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.
780,II.,
781,II.,But when the doves had reached their wonted goal
782,II.,Where the wide stair of orbèd marble dips
783,II.,"Its snows into the sea, her fluttering soul"
784,II.,Just shook the trembling petals of her lips
785,II.,"And passed into the void, and Venus knew"
786,II.,"That one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,"
787,II.,
788,II.,And bade her servants carve a cedar chest
789,II.,"With all the wonder of this history,"
790,II.,Within whose scented womb their limbs should rest
791,II.,Where olive-trees make tender the blue sky
792,II.,"On the low hills of Paphos, and the Faun"
793,II.,"Pipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn."
794,II.,
795,II.,"Nor failed they to obey her hest, and ere"
796,II.,The morning bee had stung the daffodil
797,II.,"With tiny fretful spear, or from its lair"
798,II.,The waking stag had leapt across the rill
799,II.,"And roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept"

801,II.,
802,II.,"And when day brake, within that silver shrine"
803,II.,"Fed by the flames of cressets tremulous,"
804,II.,Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine

806,II.,"Should beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,"

818,III,There by a dim and dark Lethæan well
819,III,Young Charmides was lying; wearily
820,III,"He plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,"
821,III,And with its little rifled treasury
822,III,"Strewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,"
823,III,"And watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a dream,"
824,III,
825,III,When as he gazed into the watery glass
826,III,And through his brown hair’s curly tangles scanned
827,III,"His own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass"
828,III,"Across the mirror, and a little hand"
829,III,"Stole into his, and warm lips timidly"
830,III,"Brushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a sigh."
831,III,
832,III,"Then turned he round his weary eyes and saw,"
833,III,"And ever nigher still their faces came,"
834,III,And nigher ever did their young mouths draw
835,III,"Until they seemed one perfect rose of flame,"
836,III,"And longing arms around her neck he cast,"
837,III,"And felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,"
838,III,
839,III,"And all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,"
840,III,"And all her maidenhood was his to slay,"
841,III,And limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss
842,III,"Their passion waxed and waned,—O why essay"
843,III,"To pipe again of love, too venturous reed!"
844,III,"Enough, enough that Eros laughed upon that flowerless mead."
845,III,
846,III,"Too venturous poesy, O why essay"
847,III,To pipe again of passion! fold thy wings
848,III,O’er daring Icarus and bid thy lay
849,III,Sleep hidden in the lyre’s silent strings
850,III,"Till thou hast found the old Castalian rill,"
851,III,Or from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho’s golden quid!
852,III,
853,III,"Enough, enough that he whose life had been"
854,III,"A fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,"
855,III,Could in the loveless land of Hades glean
856,III,One scorching harvest from those fields of flame
857,III,Where passion walks with naked unshod feet
858,III,"And is not wounded,—ah! enough that once their lips could meet"
859,III,
860,III,In that wild throb when all existences
861,III,Seemed narrowed to one single ecstasy
862,III,Which dies through its own sweetness and the stress
863,III,"Of too much pleasure, ere Persephone"
864,III,Had bade them serve her by the ebon throne
865,III,Of the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone.

1069,HUMANITAD,Burst from its sheathèd emerald and disclose

1120,HUMANITAD,By every forest idyll;—do I change?

1123,HUMANITAD,"Nay, nay, thou art the same: ’tis I who seek"
1124,HUMANITAD,"To vex with sighs thy simple solitude,"
1125,HUMANITAD,And because fruitless tears bedew my cheek
1126,HUMANITAD,Would have thee weep with me in brotherhood;
1127,HUMANITAD,Fool! shall each wronged and restless spirit dare
1128,HUMANITAD,To taint such wine with the salt poison of own despair!
1129,HUMANITAD,
1130,HUMANITAD,Thou art the same: ’tis I whose wretched soul

1133,HUMANITAD,"Of what should be its servitor,—for sure"

1137,HUMANITAD,"To burn with one clear flame, to stand erect"
1138,HUMANITAD,"In natural honour, not to bend the knee"
1139,HUMANITAD,In profitless prostrations whose effect
1140,HUMANITAD,"Is by itself condemned, what alchemy"

1142,HUMANITAD,Will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued?
1143,HUMANITAD,
1144,HUMANITAD,"The minor chord which ends the harmony,"
1145,HUMANITAD,And for its answering brother waits in vain
1146,HUMANITAD,"Sobbing for incompleted melody,"
1147,HUMANITAD,"Dies a swan’s death; but I the heir of pain,"
1148,HUMANITAD,"A silent Memnon with blank lidless eyes,"
1149,HUMANITAD,Wait for the light and music of those suns which never rise.

1154,HUMANITAD,Were not these better far than to return
1155,HUMANITAD,"To my old fitful restless malady,"
1156,HUMANITAD,Or spend my days within the voiceless cave of misery?
1157,HUMANITAD,
1158,HUMANITAD,Nay! for perchance that poppy-crownèd god

1160,HUMANITAD,Who talks of sleep but gives it not; his rod
1161,HUMANITAD,"Hath lost its virtue, and, when all is said,"

1164,HUMANITAD,
1165,HUMANITAD,"And Love! that noble madness, whose august"
1166,HUMANITAD,And inextinguishable might can slay
1167,HUMANITAD,"The soul with honeyed drugs,—alas! I must"
1168,HUMANITAD,"From such sweet ruin play the runaway,"
1169,HUMANITAD,Although too constant memory never can
1170,HUMANITAD,Forget the archèd splendour of those brows Olympian
1171,HUMANITAD,
1172,HUMANITAD,Which for a little season made my youth
1173,HUMANITAD,So soft a swoon of exquisite indolence
1174,HUMANITAD,That all the chiding of more prudent Truth
1175,HUMANITAD,"Seemed the thin voice of jealousy,—O hence"
1176,HUMANITAD,Thou huntress deadlier than Artemis!
1177,HUMANITAD,Go seek some other quarry! for of thy too perilous bliss.
1178,HUMANITAD,
1179,HUMANITAD,"My lips have drunk enough,—no more, no more,—"
1180,HUMANITAD,Though Love himself should turn his gilded prow
1181,HUMANITAD,Back to the troubled waters of this shore
1182,HUMANITAD,"Where I am wrecked and stranded, even now"
1183,HUMANITAD,"The chariot wheels of passion sweep too near,"
1184,HUMANITAD,"Hence!  Hence!  I pass unto a life more barren, more austere."
1185,HUMANITAD,
1186,HUMANITAD,"More barren—ay, those arms will never lean"
1187,HUMANITAD,Down through the trellised vines and draw my soul
1188,HUMANITAD,In sweet reluctance through the tangled green;
1189,HUMANITAD,"Some other head must wear that aureole,"
1190,HUMANITAD,For I am hers who loves not any man
1191,HUMANITAD,Whose white and stainless bosom bears the sign Gorgonian.
1192,HUMANITAD,
1193,HUMANITAD,"Let Venus go and chuck her dainty page,"
1194,HUMANITAD,"And kiss his mouth, and toss his curly hair,"
1195,HUMANITAD,With net and spear and hunting equipage
1196,HUMANITAD,"Let young Adonis to his tryst repair,"
1197,HUMANITAD,But me her fond and subtle-fashioned spell
1198,HUMANITAD,"Delights no more, though I could win her dearest citadel."
1199,HUMANITAD,
1200,HUMANITAD,"Ay, though I were that laughing shepherd boy"
1201,HUMANITAD,Who from Mount Ida saw the little cloud
1202,HUMANITAD,Pass over Tenedos and lofty Troy
1203,HUMANITAD,"And knew the coming of the Queen, and bowed"
1204,HUMANITAD,"In wonder at her feet, not for the sake"
1205,HUMANITAD,Of a new Helen would I bid her hand the apple take.
1206,HUMANITAD,
1207,HUMANITAD,Then rise supreme Athena argent-limbed!
1208,HUMANITAD,"And, if my lips be musicless, inspire"
1209,HUMANITAD,At least my life: was not thy glory hymned
1210,HUMANITAD,By One who gave to thee his sword and lyre
1211,HUMANITAD,"Like Æschylos at well-fought Marathon,"
1212,HUMANITAD,And died to show that Milton’s England still could bear a son!
1213,HUMANITAD,
1214,HUMANITAD,And yet I cannot tread the Portico
1215,HUMANITAD,"And live without desire, fear and pain,"
1216,HUMANITAD,Or nurture that wise calm which long ago
1217,HUMANITAD,"The grave Athenian master taught to men,"
1218,HUMANITAD,"Self-poised, self-centred, and self-comforted,"
1219,HUMANITAD,To watch the world’s vain phantasies go by with unbowed head.
1220,HUMANITAD,

1223,HUMANITAD,"Rest in their own Colonos, an eclipse"
1224,HUMANITAD,"Hath come on Wisdom, and Mnemosyne"
1225,HUMANITAD,Is childless; in the night which she had made
1226,HUMANITAD,For lofty secure flight Athena’s owl itself hath strayed.
1227,HUMANITAD,
1228,HUMANITAD,"Nor much with Science do I care to climb,"
1229,HUMANITAD,Although by strange and subtle witchery
1230,HUMANITAD,She drew the moon from heaven: the Muse Time
1231,HUMANITAD,Unrolls her gorgeous-coloured tapestry
1232,HUMANITAD,To no less eager eyes; often indeed
1233,HUMANITAD,In the great epic of Polymnia’s scroll I love to read
1234,HUMANITAD,
1235,HUMANITAD,How Asia sent her myriad hosts to war
1236,HUMANITAD,"Against a little town, and panoplied"
1237,HUMANITAD,"In gilded mail with jewelled scimitar,"
1238,HUMANITAD,"White-shielded, purple-crested, rode the Mede"
1239,HUMANITAD,Between the waving poplars and the sea
1240,HUMANITAD,"Which men call Artemisium, till he saw Thermopylæ"
1241,HUMANITAD,
1242,HUMANITAD,"Its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall,"
1243,HUMANITAD,And on the nearer side a little brood
1244,HUMANITAD,Of careless lions holding festival!
1245,HUMANITAD,"And stood amazèd at such hardihood,"
1246,HUMANITAD,"And pitched his tent upon the reedy shore,"
1247,HUMANITAD,"And stayed two days to wonder, and then crept at midnight o’er"
1248,HUMANITAD,
1249,HUMANITAD,"Some unfrequented height, and coming down"
1250,HUMANITAD,The autumn forests treacherously slew
1251,HUMANITAD,What Sparta held most dear and was the crown
1252,HUMANITAD,"Of far Eurotas, and passed on, nor knew"
1253,HUMANITAD,How God had staked an evil net for him
1254,HUMANITAD,"In the small bay at Salamis,—and yet, the page grows dim,"
1255,HUMANITAD,
1256,HUMANITAD,"Its cadenced Greek delights me not, I feel"
1257,HUMANITAD,With such a goodly time too out of tune
1258,HUMANITAD,To love it much: for like the Dial’s wheel
1259,HUMANITAD,That from its blinded darkness strikes the noon
1260,HUMANITAD,"Yet never sees the sun, so do my eyes"
1261,HUMANITAD,Restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies.
1262,HUMANITAD,
1263,HUMANITAD,O for one grand unselfish simple life
1264,HUMANITAD,To teach us what is Wisdom! speak ye hills
1265,HUMANITAD,"Of lone Helvellyn, for this note of strife"
1266,HUMANITAD,"Shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills,"
1267,HUMANITAD,Where is that Spirit which living blamelessly
1268,HUMANITAD,Yet dared to kiss the smitten mouth of his own century!
1269,HUMANITAD,
1270,HUMANITAD,Speak ye Rydalian laurels! where is he
1271,HUMANITAD,"Whose gentle head ye sheltered, that pure soul"
1272,HUMANITAD,Whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty
1273,HUMANITAD,Through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal
1274,HUMANITAD,Where love and duty mingle!  Him at least
1275,HUMANITAD,"The most high Laws were glad of, he had sat at Wisdom’s feast;"
1276,HUMANITAD,
1277,HUMANITAD,"But we are Learning’s changelings, know by rote"
1278,HUMANITAD,The clarion watchword of each Grecian school
1279,HUMANITAD,"And follow none, the flawless sword which smote"
1280,HUMANITAD,The pagan Hydra is an effete tool
1281,HUMANITAD,"Which we ourselves have blunted, what man now"
1282,HUMANITAD,Shall scale the august ancient heights and to old Reverence bow?
1283,HUMANITAD,
1284,HUMANITAD,"One such indeed I saw, but, Ichabod!"
1285,HUMANITAD,"Gone is that last dear son of Italy,"
1286,HUMANITAD,"Who being man died for the sake of God,"
1287,HUMANITAD,"And whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully,"
1288,HUMANITAD,"O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto’s tower,"
1289,HUMANITAD,Thou marble lily of the lily town! let not the lour
1290,HUMANITAD,
1291,HUMANITAD,"Of the rude tempest vex his slumber, or"
1292,HUMANITAD,The Arno with its tawny troubled gold
1293,HUMANITAD,"O’er-leap its marge, no mightier conqueror"
1294,HUMANITAD,Clomb the high Capitol in the days of old
1295,HUMANITAD,"When Rome was indeed Rome, for Liberty"
1296,HUMANITAD,"Walked like a bride beside him, at which sight pale Mystery"
1297,HUMANITAD,
1298,HUMANITAD,Fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell
1299,HUMANITAD,"With an old man who grabbled rusty keys,"
1300,HUMANITAD,"Fled shuddering, for that immemorial knell"
1301,HUMANITAD,With which oblivion buries dynasties
1302,HUMANITAD,"Swept like a wounded eagle on the blast,"
1303,HUMANITAD,As to the holy heart of Rome the great triumvir passed.
1304,HUMANITAD,
1305,HUMANITAD,"He knew the holiest heart and heights of Rome,"
1306,HUMANITAD,"He drave the base wolf from the lion’s lair,"
1307,HUMANITAD,And now lies dead by that empyreal dome
1308,HUMANITAD,Which overtops Valdarno hung in air
1309,HUMANITAD,By Brunelleschi—O Melpomene
1310,HUMANITAD,Breathe through thy melancholy pipe thy sweetest threnody!
1311,HUMANITAD,
1312,HUMANITAD,Breathe through the tragic stops such melodies
1313,HUMANITAD,"That Joy’s self may grow jealous, and the Nine"
1314,HUMANITAD,"Forget awhile their discreet emperies,"
1315,HUMANITAD,Mourning for him who on Rome’s lordliest shrine
1316,HUMANITAD,"Lit for men’s lives the light of Marathon,"
1317,HUMANITAD,And bare to sun-forgotten fields the fire of the sun!
1318,HUMANITAD,
1319,HUMANITAD,"O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto’s tower!"
1320,HUMANITAD,Let some young Florentine each eventide
1321,HUMANITAD,Bring coronals of that enchanted flower
1322,HUMANITAD,"Which the dim woods of Vallombrosa hide,"
1323,HUMANITAD,And deck the marble tomb wherein he lies
1324,HUMANITAD,Whose soul is as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eyes;
1325,HUMANITAD,
1326,HUMANITAD,"Some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings,"
1327,HUMANITAD,Being tempest-driven to the farthest rim
1328,HUMANITAD,Where Chaos meets Creation and the wings
1329,HUMANITAD,Of the eternal chanting Cherubim
1330,HUMANITAD,"Are pavilioned on Nothing, passed away"
1331,HUMANITAD,"Into a moonless void,—and yet, though he is dust and clay,"
1332,HUMANITAD,
1333,HUMANITAD,"He is not dead, the immemorial Fates"
1334,HUMANITAD,"Forbid it, and the closing shears refrain."
1335,HUMANITAD,Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates!
1336,HUMANITAD,"Ye argent clarions, sound a loftier strain"
1337,HUMANITAD,For the vile thing he hated lurks within
1338,HUMANITAD,"Its sombre house, alone with God and memories of sin."
1339,HUMANITAD,
1340,HUMANITAD,Still what avails it that she sought her cave
1341,HUMANITAD,That murderous mother of red harlotries?
1342,HUMANITAD,At Munich on the marble architrave
1343,HUMANITAD,"The Grecian boys die smiling, but the seas"
1344,HUMANITAD,Which wash Ægina fret in loneliness
1345,HUMANITAD,Not mirroring their beauty; so our lives grow colourless
1346,HUMANITAD,
1347,HUMANITAD,"For lack of our ideals, if one star"
1348,HUMANITAD,Flame torch-like in the heavens the unjust
1349,HUMANITAD,"Swift daylight kills it, and no trump of war"
1350,HUMANITAD,Can wake to passionate voice the silent dust
1351,HUMANITAD,Which was Mazzini once! rich Niobe
1352,HUMANITAD,"For all her stony sorrows hath her sons; but Italy,"
1353,HUMANITAD,
1354,HUMANITAD,"What Easter Day shall make her children rise,"
1355,HUMANITAD,Who were not Gods yet suffered? what sure feet
1356,HUMANITAD,Shall find their grave-clothes folded? what clear eyes
1357,HUMANITAD,Shall see them bodily?  O it were meet
1358,HUMANITAD,To roll the stone from off the sepulchre
1359,HUMANITAD,"And kiss the bleeding roses of their wounds, in love of her,"
1360,HUMANITAD,
1361,HUMANITAD,Our Italy! our mother visible!
1362,HUMANITAD,"Most blessed among nations and most sad,"
1363,HUMANITAD,For whose dear sake the young Calabrian fell
1364,HUMANITAD,That day at Aspromonte and was glad
1365,HUMANITAD,That in an age when God was bought and sold
1366,HUMANITAD,"One man could die for Liberty! but we, burnt out and cold,"
1367,HUMANITAD,
1368,HUMANITAD,See Honour smitten on the cheek and gyves
1369,HUMANITAD,Bind the sweet feet of Mercy: Poverty
1370,HUMANITAD,Creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives
1371,HUMANITAD,"Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily,"
1372,HUMANITAD,And no word said:—O we are wretched men
1373,HUMANITAD,Unworthy of our great inheritance! where is the pen
1374,HUMANITAD,
1375,HUMANITAD,Of austere Milton? where the mighty sword
1376,HUMANITAD,Which slew its master righteously? the years
1377,HUMANITAD,"Have lost their ancient leader, and no word"
1378,HUMANITAD,Breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears:
1379,HUMANITAD,While as a ruined mother in some spasm
1380,HUMANITAD,"Bears a base child and loathes it, so our best enthusiasm"
1381,HUMANITAD,
1382,HUMANITAD,"Genders unlawful children, Anarchy"
1383,HUMANITAD,"Freedom’s own Judas, the vile prodigal"
1384,HUMANITAD,Licence who steals the gold of Liberty
1385,HUMANITAD,"And yet has nothing, Ignorance the real"
1386,HUMANITAD,"One Fraticide since Cain, Envy the asp"
1387,HUMANITAD,"That stings itself to anguish, Avarice whose palsied grasp"
1388,HUMANITAD,
1389,HUMANITAD,"Is in its extent stiffened, moneyed Greed"
1390,HUMANITAD,For whose dull appetite men waste away
1391,HUMANITAD,Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed
1392,HUMANITAD,"Of things which slay their sower, these each day"
1393,HUMANITAD,"Sees rife in England, and the gentle feet"
1394,HUMANITAD,Of Beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street.
1395,HUMANITAD,
1396,HUMANITAD,What even Cromwell spared is desecrated
1397,HUMANITAD,"By weed and worm, left to the stormy play"
1398,HUMANITAD,"Of wind and beating snow, or renovated"
1399,HUMANITAD,By more destructful hands: Time’s worst decay
1400,HUMANITAD,"Will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness,"
1401,HUMANITAD,But these new Vandals can but make a rain-proof barrenness.
1402,HUMANITAD,
1403,HUMANITAD,Where is that Art which bade the Angels sing
1404,HUMANITAD,"Through Lincoln’s lofty choir, till the air"
1405,HUMANITAD,Seems from such marble harmonies to ring
1406,HUMANITAD,With sweeter song than common lips can dare
1407,HUMANITAD,To draw from actual reed? ah! where is now
1408,HUMANITAD,The cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches bow
1409,HUMANITAD,
1410,HUMANITAD,"For Southwell’s arch, and carved the House of One"
1411,HUMANITAD,Who loved the lilies of the field with all
1412,HUMANITAD,Our dearest English flowers? the same sun
1413,HUMANITAD,Rises for us: the seasons natural
1414,HUMANITAD,Weave the same tapestry of green and grey:
1415,HUMANITAD,The unchanged hills are with us: but that Spirit hath passed away.
1416,HUMANITAD,
1417,HUMANITAD,"And yet perchance it may be better so,"
1418,HUMANITAD,"For Tyranny is an incestuous Queen,"
1419,HUMANITAD,"Murder her brother is her bedfellow,"
1420,HUMANITAD,And the Plague chambers with her: in obscene
1421,HUMANITAD,And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set;
1422,HUMANITAD,Better the empty desert and a soul inviolate!
1423,HUMANITAD,
1424,HUMANITAD,"For gentle brotherhood, the harmony"
1425,HUMANITAD,"Of living in the healthful air, the swift"
1426,HUMANITAD,Clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free
1427,HUMANITAD,"And women chaste, these are the things which lift"
1428,HUMANITAD,Our souls up more than even Agnolo’s
1429,HUMANITAD,"Gaunt blinded Sibyl poring o’er the scroll of human woes,"
1430,HUMANITAD,
1431,HUMANITAD,Or Titian’s little maiden on the stair
1432,HUMANITAD,"White as her own sweet lily and as tall,"
1433,HUMANITAD,"Or Mona Lisa smiling through her hair,—"
1434,HUMANITAD,Ah! somehow life is bigger after all
1435,HUMANITAD,"Than any painted angel, could we see"
1436,HUMANITAD,The God that is within us!  The old Greek serenity
1437,HUMANITAD,
1438,HUMANITAD,Which curbs the passion of that level line
1439,HUMANITAD,"Of marble youths, who with untroubled eyes"
1440,HUMANITAD,And chastened limbs ride round Athena’s shrine
1441,HUMANITAD,"And mirror her divine economies,"
1442,HUMANITAD,And balanced symmetry of what in man
1443,HUMANITAD,"Would else wage ceaseless warfare,—this at least within the span"
1444,HUMANITAD,
1445,HUMANITAD,Between our mother’s kisses and the grave
1446,HUMANITAD,"Might so inform our lives, that we could win"
1447,HUMANITAD,Such mighty empires that from her cave
1448,HUMANITAD,"Temptation would grow hoarse, and pallid Sin"
1449,HUMANITAD,"Would walk ashamed of his adulteries,"
1450,HUMANITAD,And Passion creep from out the House of Lust with startled eyes.
1451,HUMANITAD,
1452,HUMANITAD,To make the body and the spirit one
1453,HUMANITAD,"With all right things, till no thing live in vain"
1454,HUMANITAD,"From morn to noon, but in sweet unison"
1455,HUMANITAD,With every pulse of flesh and throb of brain
1456,HUMANITAD,"The soul in flawless essence high enthroned,"
1457,HUMANITAD,"Against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned,"
1458,HUMANITAD,
1459,HUMANITAD,Mark with serene impartiality
1460,HUMANITAD,"The strife of things, and yet be comforted,"
1461,HUMANITAD,Knowing that by the chain causality
1462,HUMANITAD,All separate existences are wed
1463,HUMANITAD,"Into one supreme whole, whose utterance"
1464,HUMANITAD,"Is joy, or holier praise! ah! surely this were governance"
1465,HUMANITAD,
1466,HUMANITAD,"Of Life in most august omnipresence,"
1467,HUMANITAD,Through which the rational intellect would find
1468,HUMANITAD,"In passion its expression, and mere sense,"
1469,HUMANITAD,"Ignoble else, lend fire to the mind,"
1470,HUMANITAD,And being joined with it in harmony
1471,HUMANITAD,"More mystical than that which binds the stars planetary,"
1472,HUMANITAD,
1473,HUMANITAD,Strike from their several tones one octave chord
1474,HUMANITAD,Whose cadence being measureless would fly
1475,HUMANITAD,"Through all the circling spheres, then to its Lord"
1476,HUMANITAD,Return refreshed with its new empery
1477,HUMANITAD,"And more exultant power,—this indeed"
1478,HUMANITAD,"Could we but reach it were to find the last, the perfect creed."
1479,HUMANITAD,
1480,HUMANITAD,Ah! it was easy when the world was young
1481,HUMANITAD,"To keep one’s life free and inviolate,"
1482,HUMANITAD,"From our sad lips another song is rung,"
1483,HUMANITAD,"By our own hands our heads are desecrate,"
1484,HUMANITAD,"Wanderers in drear exile, and dispossessed"
1485,HUMANITAD,"Of what should be our own, we can but feed on wild unrest."
1486,HUMANITAD,
1487,HUMANITAD,"Somehow the grace, the bloom of things has flown,"
1488,HUMANITAD,And of all men we are most wretched who
1489,HUMANITAD,Must live each other’s lives and not our own
1490,HUMANITAD,For very pity’s sake and then undo
1491,HUMANITAD,All that we lived for—it was otherwise
1492,HUMANITAD,When soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies.
1493,HUMANITAD,
1494,HUMANITAD,But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
1495,HUMANITAD,"With weary feet to the new Calvary,"
1496,HUMANITAD,"Where we behold, as one who in a glass"
1497,HUMANITAD,"Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,"
1498,HUMANITAD,And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze
1499,HUMANITAD,Learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise.
1500,HUMANITAD,
1501,HUMANITAD,O smitten mouth!  O forehead crowned with thorn!
1502,HUMANITAD,O chalice of all common miseries!
1503,HUMANITAD,Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne
1504,HUMANITAD,"An agony of endless centuries,"
1505,HUMANITAD,And we were vain and ignorant nor knew
1506,HUMANITAD,That when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we slew.
1507,HUMANITAD,
1508,HUMANITAD,"Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds,"
1509,HUMANITAD,"The night that covers and the lights that fade,"
1510,HUMANITAD,"The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,"
1511,HUMANITAD,The lips betraying and the life betrayed;
1512,HUMANITAD,The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we
1513,HUMANITAD,Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.
1514,HUMANITAD,
1515,HUMANITAD,Is this the end of all that primal force
1516,HUMANITAD,"Which, in its changes being still the same,"
1517,HUMANITAD,"From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,"
1518,HUMANITAD,"Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame,"
1519,HUMANITAD,Till the suns met in heaven and began
1520,HUMANITAD,"Their cycles, and the morning stars sang, and the Word was Man!"
1521,HUMANITAD,
1522,HUMANITAD,"Nay, nay, we are but crucified, and though"
1523,HUMANITAD,The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain
1524,HUMANITAD,"Loosen the nails—we shall come down I know,"
1525,HUMANITAD,"Staunch the red wounds—we shall be whole again,"
1526,HUMANITAD,"No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,"
1527,HUMANITAD,"That which is purely human, that is godlike, that is God."
