44,PREFACE,
45,PREFACE,"These verses were written in India between the years 1881 and 1899,"
46,PREFACE,mostly during my researches on malaria. Friends who have read that part
47,PREFACE,of them which is called _In Exile_ complained that they could not easily
48,PREFACE,follow the movement of it; and as I am now publishing the poems together
49,PREFACE,with a text-book on malaria—and also because I desire very strongly to
50,PREFACE,rid my mind of this subject which has occupied it for twenty years—I
51,PREFACE,take the opportunity to give such explanation of the work as I can find
52,PREFACE,expression for.
53,PREFACE,
54,PREFACE,"In 1881 I joined the military medical service of India, and was called"
55,PREFACE,"upon to serve during the next seven years in Madras, Bangalore, Burma,"
56,PREFACE,"and the Andaman Islands. Having abundant leisure, I occupied most of it"
57,PREFACE,"in the study of various sciences and arts, in all of which I attempted"
58,PREFACE,some works to the best of my ability. For this I make no excuse to my
59,PREFACE,"conscience, since to my mind art and science are the same, and efforts"
60,PREFACE,"in both, however poor the result may be, are to be commended more than"
61,PREFACE,"idleness. Near the end of the seven years, however, I began to be drawn"
62,PREFACE,toward certain thoughts which from the first had occurred to me in my
63,PREFACE,"profession, especially as to the cause of the widespread sickness and of"
64,PREFACE,the great misery and decadence of the people of India. Racked by
65,PREFACE,"poverty, swept by epidemics, housed in hovels, ruled by superstitions,"
66,PREFACE,they presented the spectacle of an ancient civilisation fallen for
67,PREFACE,centuries into decay. One saw there both physical and mental
68,PREFACE,degeneration. Since the time of the early mathematicians science had
69,PREFACE,"died; and since that of the great temples art had become ornament, and"
70,PREFACE,religion dogma. Here was the living picture of the fate which destroyed
71,PREFACE,"Greece, Rome, and Spain; and I saw in it the work of nescience—the"
72,PREFACE,"opposite of science. . . . Returning to Britain in 1888, I qualified"
73,PREFACE,"myself for pathological researches, and about 1890 or 1891 entered upon"
74,PREFACE,"a careful study of malarial fever, in the hope of finding out accurately"
75,PREFACE,"how it is caused and may be prevented. On August 20, 1897, I was"
76,PREFACE,"fortunate enough to find the clue to the problem—which, I believe,"
77,PREFACE,would not have been discovered but for such good fortune; and the next
78,PREFACE,year I ascertained the principal facts which I had been in search of.
79,PREFACE,
80,PREFACE,"These poems are the notes of the wayside. As for _In Exile_, I do not"
81,PREFACE,remember the date—but it was early in the course of the labour—when my
82,PREFACE,thoughts began to shape themselves into a kind of sonnet of three short
83,PREFACE,stanzas. It was a pleasure and relief after the day’s work to mould them
84,PREFACE,"thus, for each set of stanzas required a different balance and structure"
85,PREFACE,"within its narrow limits, and was, so to speak, inscribed on small"
86,PREFACE,"squares of stone, to be put away and arranged thereafter. Later, when my"
87,PREFACE,"researches had attained to success, a sudden disastrous interruption of"
88,PREFACE,"them compelled me to set aside the verses also, and it was not until"
89,PREFACE,nine years afterwards that I found time to arrange them for rough
90,PREFACE,"printing. They were then put nearly in the order of writing, some"
91,PREFACE,fragments being finished but most omitted. I have blamed myself for
92,PREFACE,"this, because the omissions give to the whole a more sombre cast than is"
93,PREFACE,"natural to me, or than I had intended; but now I judge I was right in"
94,PREFACE,"it. The poem, such as it is, is not a diary in verse, but rather the"
95,PREFACE,figure of a work and of a philosophy. . . . I find I cannot rise with
96,PREFACE,those who would soar above reason in the chase of something supernal.
97,PREFACE,Infinities and absolutes are still beyond us; though we may hope to come
98,PREFACE,nearer to them some day by the patient study of little things. Our first
99,PREFACE,duty is the opposite of that which many prophets enjoin upon us—or so I
100,PREFACE,think. We must not accept any speculations merely because they now
101,PREFACE,"appear pleasant, flattering, or ennobling to us. We must be content to"
102,PREFACE,creep upwards step by step; planting each foot on the firmest finding of
103,PREFACE,the moment; using the compass and such other instruments as we have;
104,PREFACE,observing without either despair or contempt the clouds and precipices
105,PREFACE,above and beneath us. Especially our duty at present is to better our
106,PREFACE,present foothold; to investigate; to comprehend the forces of nature; to
107,PREFACE,"set our state rationally in order; to stamp down disease in body, mind,"
108,PREFACE,"and government; to lighten the monstrous misery of our fellows, not by"
109,PREFACE,"windy dogmas, but by calm science. The sufferings of the world are due"
110,PREFACE,"to this, that we despise those plain earthly teachers, reason, work, and"
111,PREFACE,"discipline. Lost in many speculations, we leave our house disordered,"
112,PREFACE,"unkept, and dirty. We indulge too much in dreams; in politics which"
113,PREFACE,organise not prosperity but contention; in philosophies which expressly
114,PREFACE,"teach irrationalism, fakirism, and nescience. The poor fakir seated"
115,PREFACE,begging by the roadside; with his visions—and his sores! Such is
116,PREFACE,man. . . . An old philosophy this—like the opposite one. The poem
117,PREFACE,gathers itself under it and attempts to use the great symbols of that
118,PREFACE,"wonderful Land, the drought, the doubt, the pains of self, the arid"
119,PREFACE,"labour, the horrors of whole nations diseased, the crime of Nescience,"
120,PREFACE,"parodying God’s words, and the victory of His thunder and rain."
121,PREFACE,
122,PREFACE,"The dated stanzas near the end, except the first two lines of the second"
123,PREFACE,"quatrain, were written the day after the discovery of the parasites of"
124,PREFACE,"malaria in mosquitos. There are some repetitions, and I fear worse"
125,PREFACE,faults; but it is too late to mend them. I am much indebted to Mr. John
126,PREFACE,Masefield and Mrs. Masefield for assisting me in the correction of the
127,PREFACE,proofs.

222,INDIA,The same fate fall on thee.
223,INDIA,
224,INDIA,Lo here the iron winter of curst caste
225,INDIA,Has made men into things that creep;
226,INDIA,The leprous beggars totter trembling past;
227,INDIA,The baser sultans sleep.
228,INDIA,
229,INDIA,Not for a thousand years has Freedom’s cry

232,INDIA,That yet have never lived.
233,INDIA,

238,INDIA,
239,INDIA,"O Heaven, shall man rebelling never take"

255,THOUGHT,"Thou seëst the heavens, and earth, and marts and towers"
256,THOUGHT,Of teeming man; the battle smoke that lours
257,THOUGHT,Above the nations where they strive below;—

259,THOUGHT,Of shrieking peoples yielding to the brink—

275,SCIENCE,No high-piled monuments are theirs who chose
276,SCIENCE,Her great inglorious toil—no flaming death;
277,SCIENCE,"To them was sweet the poetry of prose,"
278,SCIENCE,But wisdom gave a fragrance to their breath.
279,SCIENCE,"Alas! we sleep and snore beyond the night,"
280,SCIENCE,Tho’ these great men the dreamless daylight show;

3384,I,This day relenting God
3385,I,Hath placed within my hand
3386,I,A wondrous thing; and God
3387,I,"Be praised. At His command,"
3388,I,
3389,I,Seeking His secret deeds
3390,I,"With tears and toiling breath,"
3391,I,"I find thy cunning seeds,"
3392,I,O million-murdering Death.
3393,I,
3394,I,I know this little thing
3395,I,A myriad men will save.
3396,I,"O Death, where is thy sting?"
3397,I,"Thy victory, O Grave?"

3404,II,"Before Thy feet I fall,"
3405,II,"Lord, who made high my fate;"
3406,II,For in the mighty small
3407,II,Thou showedst the mighty great.
3408,II,
3409,II,Henceforth I will resound
3410,II,But praises unto Thee;
3411,II,"Tho’ I was beat and bound,"
3412,II,Thou gavest me victory.
3413,II,
3414,II,Tho’ in these depths of night
3415,II,"Deep-dungeon’d I was hurl’d,"
3416,II,Thou sentest me a light
3417,II,Wherewith to mend the world.
3418,II,
3419,II,"O Exile, while thine eyes"
3420,II,Were weary with the night
3421,II,Thou weepedst; now arise
3422,II,And bless the Lord of Light.
3423,II,
3424,II,Hereafter let thy lyre
3425,II,Be bondsman to His name;
3426,II,His thunder and His fire
3427,II,Will fill thy lips with flame.
3428,II,
3429,II,He is the Lord of Light;
3430,II,He is the Thing That Is;
3431,II,He sends the seeing sight;
3432,II,And the right mind is His.

3437,III,The cagèd bird awake
3438,III,"All night laments his doom,"
3439,III,And hears the dim dawn break
3440,III,About the darken’d room;
3441,III,
3442,III,"But in the day he sips,"
3443,III,"Contented in his place,"
3444,III,"His food from human lips,"
3445,III,And learns the human face.
3446,III,
3447,III,So tho’ his home remain
3448,III,"Dark, and his fields untrod,"
3449,III,"The exile has this gain,"
3450,III,To have found the face of God.
3451,III,
3452,III,"Confounded at the close,"
3453,III,Confounded standing where
3454,III,"No further pathway shows,"
3455,III,We find an angel there
3456,III,
3457,III,To guide us. God is good;
3458,III,The seeing sight is dim;
3459,III,He gives us solitude
3460,III,That we may be with Him.
3461,III,
3462,III,By that we have we lose;
3463,III,"By what we have not, get;"
3464,III,And where we cannot choose
3465,III,The crown of life is set.
3466,III,
3467,III,"Lo, while we ask the stars"
3468,III,"To learn the will of God,"
3469,III,His answer unawares
3470,III,Strikes sudden from the sod.
3471,III,
3472,III,Not when we wait the word
3473,III,The word of God is giv’n;
3474,III,The voice of God is heard
3475,III,As much from earth as heav’n.
3476,III,
3477,III,The voice of God is heard
3478,III,Not in the thunder-fit;
3479,III,"A still small voice is heard,"
3480,III,"Half-heard, and that is it."
