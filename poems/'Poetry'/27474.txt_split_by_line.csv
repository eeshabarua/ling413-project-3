35,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Long ere the Sun the heaven arrayed,"
36,QUEEN BERNGERD,For her morning gift her Lord she prayed:
37,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""Give me Samsoe to have and to hold,"
38,QUEEN BERNGERD,"And from every maiden a crown of gold."""
39,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
40,QUEEN BERNGERD,
41,QUEEN BERNGERD,The King he answered Berngerd thus:
42,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""Madam, crave something less of us,"
43,QUEEN BERNGERD,For many a maid lives 'neath our sway
44,QUEEN BERNGERD,"To 'scape from death could the like not pay."""
45,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
46,QUEEN BERNGERD,
47,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""My gentle Lord, then hear my prayer,"
48,QUEEN BERNGERD,Suffer not ladies the scarlet to wear;
49,QUEEN BERNGERD,"And, Sir, you must grant me this boon beside,"
50,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Let no boor's son a good courser ride."""
51,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
52,QUEEN BERNGERD,
53,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""What ladies can buy to wear they are free,"
54,QUEEN BERNGERD,And hindrance none they shall meet from me;
55,QUEEN BERNGERD,"If the son of a Boor can a horse support,"
56,QUEEN BERNGERD,"'Fore God, I'll never destroy his sport!"""
57,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
58,QUEEN BERNGERD,
59,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""My Lord, we'll that matter let drop to the ground;"
60,QUEEN BERNGERD,"With chains of steel let the land be bound,"
61,QUEEN BERNGERD,So that man or woman thereout or therein
62,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Withouten toll cannot hope to win."""
63,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
64,QUEEN BERNGERD,
65,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""How should we so much steel obtain,"
66,QUEEN BERNGERD,As to bind therewith the land and main?
67,QUEEN BERNGERD,"O Madam! some mercy and kindness shew,"
68,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Or expect the curse of the people now."""
69,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
70,QUEEN BERNGERD,
71,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""To Ribe, to winter there, we'll depart,"
72,QUEEN BERNGERD,There smiths we shall find well skilled in their art;
73,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Both locks and keys will we have made,"
74,QUEEN BERNGERD,"And toeen and iron palisade."""
75,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
76,QUEEN BERNGERD,
77,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""Faggot and coal shall the boor give free,"
78,QUEEN BERNGERD,The smith shall work without thanks or fee.
79,QUEEN BERNGERD,"My Lord, be persuaded, I rede ye do,"
80,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Much benefit thence shall to thee accrue."""
81,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
82,QUEEN BERNGERD,
83,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""My father was King in the land before me,"
84,QUEEN BERNGERD,And a King for his father also had he;
85,QUEEN BERNGERD,The Kings of the Danes to live contrive
86,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Without Boor and Burger skinning alive."""
87,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
88,QUEEN BERNGERD,
89,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""Sir, what would a peasant more"
90,QUEEN BERNGERD,Than a latticed window and wicker door?
91,QUEEN BERNGERD,What shall a peasant keep in his stall
92,QUEEN BERNGERD,Save one draught ox and a cow withall?
93,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
94,QUEEN BERNGERD,
95,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""Each peasant's wife of a son made light"
96,QUEEN BERNGERD,Shall give me an ounce of gold so bright;
97,QUEEN BERNGERD,"But if to a daughter birth she give,"
98,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Only the half I'm content to receive."""
99,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
100,QUEEN BERNGERD,
101,QUEEN BERNGERD,"The King he turned on his other side,"
102,QUEEN BERNGERD,He'd heard enough to suffice for that tide.
103,QUEEN BERNGERD,"As soon as sleep his brow came o'er,"
104,QUEEN BERNGERD,Dagmar he thought stood his face before.
105,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
106,QUEEN BERNGERD,
107,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""The bitter flower, Sir King, you hold,"
108,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Brings you trouble, as I foretold."
109,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Be sure if this year you seek the fray,"
110,QUEEN BERNGERD,You suffer not Berngerd at home to stay.
111,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
112,QUEEN BERNGERD,
113,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""If she with her flatteries blind your eyes,"
114,QUEEN BERNGERD,The child will weep in the cradle that lies.
115,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Take her with you, I rede and beseech,"
116,QUEEN BERNGERD,"How that will boot you time will teach."""
117,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
118,QUEEN BERNGERD,
119,QUEEN BERNGERD,"The King has proclaimed through the whole country,"
120,QUEEN BERNGERD,To the war with him each tenth man should hie.
121,QUEEN BERNGERD,"""My dearest Lady, worthy thou art"
122,QUEEN BERNGERD,"In the field of honour to bear a part."""
123,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
124,QUEEN BERNGERD,
125,QUEEN BERNGERD,The first shaft shot on the battle day
126,QUEEN BERNGERD,To the heart of Berngerd found its way;
127,QUEEN BERNGERD,No soul was seen with a tearful eye--
128,QUEEN BERNGERD,Who for Berngerd would sorrow or sigh?
129,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
130,QUEEN BERNGERD,
131,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Now lies Berngerd in the cold black ground,"
132,QUEEN BERNGERD,Oxen are still in the Boor's stall found.
133,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Berngerd she lies 'neath the dingy sward,"
134,QUEEN BERNGERD,The Danes their Monarch love and regard.
135,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."
136,QUEEN BERNGERD,
137,QUEEN BERNGERD,"Now Berngerd lies in eternal pains,"
138,QUEEN BERNGERD,The boor his horse and cow retains.
139,QUEEN BERNGERD,"A name she left of such evil savour,"
140,QUEEN BERNGERD,So little the poor man did she favour.
141,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_,_ Berngerd_."
142,QUEEN BERNGERD,
143,QUEEN BERNGERD,"'Tis better to live in humble state,"
144,QUEEN BERNGERD,Than rich with a poor man's curse and hate;
145,QUEEN BERNGERD,After virtue better to ceaseless strain
146,QUEEN BERNGERD,Than the wealth of the world with scorn obtain.
147,QUEEN BERNGERD,"_Woe befall her_, _Berngerd_."

152,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN
153,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
154,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
155,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"Dame Martha dwelt at Karisegaard,"
156,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,So many kind deeds she wrought:
157,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"If the winter were sharp and the rich man hard,"
158,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,Her gate the indigent sought.
159,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
160,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"With her hand the hungry she loved to feed,"
161,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,To the sick she lent her aid;
162,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"The prisoner oft from his chains she freed,"
163,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,And for souls of sinners pray'd.
164,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
165,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"Denmark's land was in peril dire,"
166,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,The Swede around burnt and slew;
167,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"The castle of Martha was wrapped in fire,"
168,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,To the church the good lady flew.
169,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
170,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"She dwelt in the tower both night and day,"
171,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,There unto her none repaired;
172,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"'Neath the church roof sat the dull owl gray,"
173,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,And at the good lady stared.
174,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
175,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,In the house of the Lord she dwelt safe and content
176,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,'Till the foes their departure had ta'en;
177,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"Then back to her ruined castle she went,"
178,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,And bade it be builded again.
179,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
180,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"There found the houseless a cover once more,"
181,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,And the mouths of the hungry bread;
182,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,But all in Karise-By {14} wept sore
183,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,When they knew Dame Martha dead.
184,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
185,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"And when the Dame lay in her coffin and smil'd,"
186,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"So calm with her pallid face,"
187,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,O there was never so little a child
188,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,But was brought on her to gaze.
189,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
190,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"The bell on the day of the burial toll'd,"
191,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,And youth and age shed the tear;
192,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,No man was ever so weak or old
193,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,But helped to lift the bier.
194,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
195,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"When they the bier set down for a space,"
196,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"And rested upon the road,"
197,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"A fountain sprang forth in that very place,"
198,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,To this hour has it flow'd.
199,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
200,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"God bless for ever the pious soul,"
201,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,Her blessings no lips can tell;
202,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"For oft have the sick become sound and whole,"
203,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,Who drank at Dame Martha's well!
204,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,
205,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"The tower yet stands with gloomy nook,"
206,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,Where Dame Martha sat of old;
207,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,"The stranger comes thereon to look,"
208,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,And to hear the story told.
209,DAME MARTHA'S FOUNTAIN,

213,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS
214,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
215,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
216,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,O'er the sweet smelling meads with his lyre in his hand
217,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,The bard was straying;
218,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"In the twilight of evening, refreshing and bland,"
219,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,His chords were playing.
220,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"He sang of the flowrets that slept in the tomb,"
221,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"He sang of the flowrets that poured their perfume,"
222,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,He sang of the flowrets that yet were to bloom.
223,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
224,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And the rose departed,"
225,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,A smile from its sepulchre darted;
226,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,And the rose yet living with blushes of red
227,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Breathed sweets o'er his head.
228,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And the rose which unborn concealed yet lies,"
229,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Seemed to open before his eyes.
230,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,By a fountain's side with verdure array'd
231,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Himself he laid.
232,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
233,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And the murmur and hum of the pure water fleeting,"
234,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And the strains, which the birds of the wood were repeating,"
235,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And the innocent heart, which so peaceful was beating,"
236,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Shed health-giving slumbers,"
237,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,On lids which no sorrow cumbers.
238,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
239,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,In the visions of sleep there came to his side
240,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,A sire with locks snow-hoary;
241,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,And the songster sped with that sire for his guide
242,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,To an unknown territory.
243,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
244,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"On ruins majestic himself he found,"
245,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,The mouldering bones of old heroes lay round;
246,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Their ghosts awaking
247,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Rose from their graves wild gestures making.
248,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,The youth was quaking--
249,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,But the old man smiled as his mind he led
250,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,To the kempion times long fled.
251,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
252,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Then a lamp in the night's deep silence shone
253,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Through the dingy mould,"
254,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,And under the masses of fallen stone
255,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,There glittered gold.
256,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
257,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"To the harp then pointing the sage disappears,"
258,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,And the youth shed tears.
259,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""Yes, yes, the young bard thy countenance knows,"""
260,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,So sang in wild passion the boy--
261,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""Not in vain in my bosom a holy fire glows,"
262,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Not in vain thy bright lamp the grave's mystery shews,"
263,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"The bard will obey thee with joy."""
264,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
265,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Again there appeared in the dreams of the stripling
266,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,A being who held him intent;
267,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"It came as in flood come the high billows rippling,"
268,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Like billows when ebbing it went.
269,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
270,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Though the look of an aged and slow female wearing,"
271,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"It ran like the breezes in spring time careering,"
272,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Full often it vanished with threatening bearing.
273,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"But suddenly caught he the fugitive wild,"
274,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,And then by his breast a maiden smil'd.
275,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""Thee often I've met on life's journey,"" he said,"
276,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""And when like a meteor thou past me hast sped,"
277,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,I've seen thee look backward--and threaten.
278,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
279,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""O! kiss me, sweet maiden, ere on thou dost stray,"
280,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,I've seen thee with flowers strew the wanderer's way.
281,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"They lived in their brightness,"
282,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"When thou in this lightness,"
283,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Had'st fled farthest off; and sometimes they became
284,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,A Bauta-stone over the worm-wasted frame.
285,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
286,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""Vouchsafe me a smile,"" said the youth, ""I entreat,"
287,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,I know thy course lightning-fleet.
288,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Thy light pinions ever
289,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Thou pliest, sweet giver"
290,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Of palms, verdant palms, to the stripling so clever,"
291,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Who caught thee, though lightning fleet."""
292,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
293,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Again to his eye a fair vision was given,"
294,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,A being angelical stood in the heaven.
295,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,In morn's fresh rose-hues drest
296,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Stood the spirit blest.
297,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,As shines from above
298,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,The starlet of love
299,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,So kindled his glance toward earth's gentle child.
300,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"As the maid to her beckons the youth she loves dearly,"
301,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"When vespers are chiming and Luna shines clearly,"
302,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"So toward him beckoned the Angel, and smil'd."
303,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
304,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"With rapture the songster took thither his way,"
305,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Where the winged one of heaven stood beauteous and gay.
306,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"But, just as he hoped that the height was surmounted,"
307,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Far distant again they each other confronted.
308,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And still the Angel beckoned there,"
309,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"But--never, never near."
310,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""My seraph! wilt ever avoid my embrace?"""
311,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,--Said the songster with mortified mien--
312,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""But though I'm unable to climb to thy place,"
313,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"My eye thou hast blest from the mansions of grace,"
314,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And thy heaven, thou distant, I've seen."""
315,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
316,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"His slumber departed, his visions they fled,"
317,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,But oft when he harped they came into his head.
318,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""Blest, trebly blest, may our life be regarded,"
319,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Far unto me hear threefold life is awarded.
320,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
321,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"""See the roselet departed,"
322,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,A smile from its tomb has darted.
323,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"And the rose, which yet lives in blushes and bloom,"
324,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,Breathes o'er me perfume.
325,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Yes, from its concealment, the unborn rose"
326,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,"Before me seems to unclose."""
327,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
328,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,
329,THE BARD AND THE DREAMS,

331,KING OLUF THE SAINT,KING OLUF THE SAINT
332,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
333,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
334,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"King Oluf and his brother bold,"
335,KING OLUF THE SAINT,'Bout Norroway's rocks a parley hold.
336,KING OLUF THE SAINT,(_So sweet in Drontheim 'tis to dwell_!)
337,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
338,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""The one of us two who best can sail,"
339,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Shall rule o'er Norroway's hill and dale.
340,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
341,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Who first of us reaches our native ground,"
342,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"O'er all the region shall King be crown'd."""
343,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
344,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Then Harald Haardrode answer made:
345,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Aye, let it be even as thou hast said."
346,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
347,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""But if I to-day must sail with thee,"
348,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Thou shalt change vessels, I swear, with me."
349,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
350,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""For thou hast got the Dragon of speed,"
351,KING OLUF THE SAINT,I shall make with the Ox a poor figure indeed.
352,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
353,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""The dragon is swift as the clouds in chase,"
354,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"The ox he moveth at lazy pace."""
355,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
356,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Hear, Harald, what I shall say to thee,"
357,KING OLUF THE SAINT,What thou hast proposed well pleaseth me.
358,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
359,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""If my ship in aught be better than thine,"
360,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"I'm readily, cheerfully lend thee mine."
361,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
362,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Do thou the Dragon so sprightly take,"
363,KING OLUF THE SAINT,And I with the Ox will the journey make.
364,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
365,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""But first to the Church we'll bend our way,"
366,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Ere our hand on sail or on oar we lay."""
367,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
368,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"And into the Church Saint Oluf trode,"
369,KING OLUF THE SAINT,His beautiful hair like the bright gold glow'd.
370,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
371,KING OLUF THE SAINT,But soon out of breath there came a man:
372,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Thy brother is sailing off, fast as he can."""
373,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
374,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Let them sail, my friend, who to sail may choose,"
375,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"The word of our Lord we will not lose,"
376,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
377,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""The Mass is the word of our blessed Lord."
378,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Take water, ye swains, for our table board."
379,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
380,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""We will sit at board, and the bread we will taste,"
381,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Then unto the sea-shore will we haste."""
382,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
383,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Now down they all sped to the ocean strand,"
384,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Where the Ox lay rocking before the land.
385,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
386,KING OLUF THE SAINT,And speedily they to the ocean bore
387,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"The anchor, and cable, the sail and oar."
388,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
389,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Saint Oluf he stood on the prow when on board:
390,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Now forward, thou Ox, in the name of the Lord!"""
391,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
392,KING OLUF THE SAINT,He grappled the Ox by the horn so white:
393,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Hie now as if thou went clover to bite!"""
394,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
395,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Then forward the Ox began to hie,"
396,KING OLUF THE SAINT,In his wake roll'd the billows boisterously.
397,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
398,KING OLUF THE SAINT,He hallooed to the lad on the yard so high:
399,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Do we the Dragon of Harald draw nigh?"""
400,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
401,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""No more of the pomps of the world I see,"
402,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Than the uppermost top of the good oak tree.
403,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
404,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""I see, 'neath the land of Norroway, skim"
405,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Bright silken sails with a golden rim.
406,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
407,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""I see, 'neath Norroway's mountains proud,"
408,KING OLUF THE SAINT,The Dragon bearing of sail a cloud.
409,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
410,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""I see, I see, by Norroway's side,"
411,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"The Dragon gallantly forward stride!"""
412,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
413,KING OLUF THE SAINT,On the ribs of the Ox a blow he gave:
414,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Now faster, faster, over the wave!"""
415,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
416,KING OLUF THE SAINT,He struck the Ox on the eye with force:
417,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""To the haven much speedier thou must course!"""
418,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
419,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Then forward the Ox began to leap,"
420,KING OLUF THE SAINT,No sailor on deck his stand could keep.
421,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
422,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Then cords he took, and his mariners fast"
423,KING OLUF THE SAINT,He tied to the vessel's sheets and mast.
424,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
425,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"'Twas then, 'twas then, the steersman cried:"
426,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""But who shall now the vessel guide?"""
427,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
428,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"His white gloves off Saint Oluf throws,"
429,KING OLUF THE SAINT,And he himself to the rudder goes.
430,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
431,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""O we will sail o'er cliff and height,"
432,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"The nearest way like a line of light."""
433,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
434,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"So o'er the hills and dales they career,"
435,KING OLUF THE SAINT,To them they became like water clear.
436,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
437,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"They sailed along o'er the mountains blue,"
438,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Then out came running the Elfin crew.
439,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
440,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Who sails o'er the gold in which we joy?"
441,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Our ancient father who dares annoy?"""
442,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
443,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Elf, turn to stone and a stone remain,"
444,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Till I by this path return again!"""
445,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
446,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"So they sailed o'er Skaaney's mountains tall,"
447,KING OLUF THE SAINT,And stones became the little elves all.
448,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
449,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Out came a Carline, with spindle and rok:"
450,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Saint Oluf! why sailest thou us to mock?"
451,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
452,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Saint Oluf, thou who the red beard hast,"
453,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Through my chamber wall thy ship hath passed."""
454,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
455,KING OLUF THE SAINT,With a glance of scorn did Saint Oluf say:
456,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"""Stand there a flint rock for ever and aye!"""
457,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
458,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Unchided, unhindered, they bravely sailed on,"
459,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Before them yielded both stock and stone.
460,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
461,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Still onward they sailed in such gallant guise,"
462,KING OLUF THE SAINT,That no man upon them could fix his eyes.
463,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
464,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Saint Oluf a bow before his knee bent,"
465,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Behind the sail dropped the shaft he sent.
466,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
467,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"From the prow Saint Oluf a barb shot free,"
468,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Behind the Ox fell the shaft in the sea.
469,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
470,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Saint Oluf he trusted In Christ alone,"
471,KING OLUF THE SAINT,And therefore home by three days he won.
472,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
473,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"That made Harald with fury storm,"
474,KING OLUF THE SAINT,Of a laidly dragon he took the form.
475,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
476,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"But the Saint was a man of devotion full,"
477,KING OLUF THE SAINT,And the Saint gat Norroway's land to rule.
478,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
479,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Into the Church Saint Oluf strode,"
480,KING OLUF THE SAINT,He thanked the Saviour in fervent mode.
481,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
482,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Saint Oluf walked the Church about,"
483,KING OLUF THE SAINT,There shone a glory his ringlets out.
484,KING OLUF THE SAINT,
485,KING OLUF THE SAINT,"Whom God doth help makes bravely his way,"
486,KING OLUF THE SAINT,His enemies win but shame and dismay.
