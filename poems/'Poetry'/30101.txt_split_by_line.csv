53,FOREWORD,Paul Brown has a carborundum eye for the most
54,FOREWORD,extreme poetic minutia at a time when most of the
55,FOREWORD,"younger poets indulge in introspective rhetoric, dulling"
56,FOREWORD,"that faint minority of poem tasters. However, in"
57,FOREWORD,Brown's case one can instantly sense the private and
58,FOREWORD,resonant landscape in the delicate - nature and
59,FOREWORD,"anthro-pomorphic poems, radiant creations - exciting water"
60,FOREWORD,"colour, a true painter of words."
61,FOREWORD,The Three Trees Press should be congratulated for
