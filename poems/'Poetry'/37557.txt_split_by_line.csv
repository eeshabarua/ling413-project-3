118,A FOREWORD,
119,A FOREWORD,To even the casual reader of poetry who may chance to turn to the
120,A FOREWORD,following pages it will be evident that the lyrics contained therein
121,A FOREWORD,have been written without what is commonly known as end-rhyme.  It may
122,A FOREWORD,also be claimed by this reader that the lyrics before him are without
123,A FOREWORD,"rhythm.  As such, it may at first seem that they mark an effort in"
124,A FOREWORD,revolt against two of the primary assets of modern versification.
125,A FOREWORD,
126,A FOREWORD,"All art, of course, has its ancestry.  While it is the duty of poetry"
127,A FOREWORD,"both to remember and to honour its inherited grandeurs, the paradoxical"
128,A FOREWORD,fact remains that even this most convention-ridden medium of emotional
129,A FOREWORD,expression is a sort of warfare between the embattled soul of the
130,A FOREWORD,"artist, seeking articulation, and the immuring traditions with which"
131,A FOREWORD,time and the prosodian have surrounded him.
132,A FOREWORD,
133,A FOREWORD,"In painting and in music, as in sculpture and the drama, there has been"
134,A FOREWORD,"a movement of late to achieve what may be called formal emancipation, a"
135,A FOREWORD,struggle to break away from the restraints and the technical
136,A FOREWORD,obligations imposed upon the worker by his artistic predecessors.  In
137,A FOREWORD,"one case this movement may be called Futurism, and in another it may be"
138,A FOREWORD,"termed Romanticism, but the tendency is the same.  The spirit of man is"
139,A FOREWORD,seen in rebellion against a form that has become too intricate or too
140,A FOREWORD,fixed to allow him freedom of utterance.
141,A FOREWORD,
142,A FOREWORD,"Poetry alone, during the last century, seems to have remained stable,"
143,A FOREWORD,"in the matter of structure.  Few new forms have been invented, and with"
144,A FOREWORD,one or two rare exceptions success has been achieved through
145,A FOREWORD,ingeniously elaborating on an already established formula and through
146,A FOREWORD,"meticulously re-echoing what has already been said.  This has resulted,"
147,A FOREWORD,"on the one hand, in a technical dexterity which often enough resembles"
148,A FOREWORD,"the strained postures of acrobatism, and, on the other, in that"
149,A FOREWORD,constantly reiterated complaint as to the hollowness and aloofness of
150,A FOREWORD,"modern poetry.  Yet this poetry is remote and insincere, not because"
151,A FOREWORD,"the modern spirit is incapable of feeling, but because what the singer"
152,A FOREWORD,of to-day has felt has not been directly and openly expressed.  His
153,A FOREWORD,"apparel has remained mediæval.  He must still don mail to face Mausers,"
154,A FOREWORD,and wear chain-armour against machine-guns.  He must scout through the
155,A FOREWORD,"shadowy hinterlands of consciousness in attire that may be historic,"
156,A FOREWORD,yet at the same time is distressingly conspicuous.  And when he begins
157,A FOREWORD,his assault on those favouring moments or inspirational moods which
158,A FOREWORD,"lurk in the deeper valleys and by-ways of sensibility, he must begin it"
159,A FOREWORD,"as a marked man, pathetically resplendent in that rigid steel which is"
160,A FOREWORD,an anachronism and no longer an armour.
161,A FOREWORD,
162,A FOREWORD,"Rhyme, from the first, has been imposed upon him.  His only escape from"
163,A FOREWORD,rhyme has been the larger utterance of blank verse.  Yet the iambic
164,A FOREWORD,"pentameter of his native tongue, perfected in the sweeping sonority of"
165,A FOREWORD,the later Shakespearean tragedies and left even more intimidatingly
166,A FOREWORD,"austere in the organ-like roll of Milton, has been found by the later"
167,A FOREWORD,singer to be ill-fitted for the utterance of those more intimate moods
168,A FOREWORD,and those subjective experiences which may be described as
169,A FOREWORD,"characteristically modern.  Verse, in the nature of things, has become"
170,A FOREWORD,"less epic and racial, and more and more lyric and personal.  The poet,"
171,A FOREWORD,"consequently, has been forced back into the narrower domain so formally"
172,A FOREWORD,and so rigidly fenced in by rhyme.  And before touching on the
173,A FOREWORD,"limitations resulting from this incarceration, it may be worth while to"
174,A FOREWORD,venture a brief glance back over the history of what Milton himself
175,A FOREWORD,"denominated as ""the jingling sounds of like endings"" and Goldsmith"
176,A FOREWORD,"characterized as ""a vile monotony"" and even Howells has spoken of as"
177,A FOREWORD,"""the artificial trammels of verse."""
178,A FOREWORD,
179,A FOREWORD,It has been claimed that those early poets of Palestine who affected
180,A FOREWORD,the custom of beginning a number of lines or stanzas with the same
181,A FOREWORD,letter of the alphabet unconsciously prepared the way for that
182,A FOREWORD,latter-day ornamental fringe known as end-rhyme.  Others have claimed
183,A FOREWORD,that this insistence of a consonance of terminals is a relique of the
184,A FOREWORD,"communal force of the chant, where the clapping of hands, the stamping"
185,A FOREWORD,"of feet, or the twanging of bow-strings marked the period-ends of"
186,A FOREWORD,"prehistoric recitative.  The bow-string of course, later evolved into"
187,A FOREWORD,"the musical instrument, and when poetry became a written as well as a"
188,A FOREWORD,spoken language the consonantal drone of rhyming end-words took the
189,A FOREWORD,place of the discarded instrument which had served to mark a secondary
190,A FOREWORD,and wider rhythm in the progress of impassioned recitative.
191,A FOREWORD,
192,A FOREWORD,"It must be admitted, however, even in the face of this ingenious"
193,A FOREWORD,"pleading, that rhyme is a much more modern invention than it seems."
194,A FOREWORD,That it is not rudimentary in the race is evidenced by the fact that
195,A FOREWORD,"many languages, such as the Celtic, the Teutonic, and the Scandinavian,"
196,A FOREWORD,"are quite without it.  The Greeks, even in their melic poetry, saw no"
197,A FOREWORD,"need for it.  The same may be said of the Romans, though with them it"
198,A FOREWORD,will occasionally be found that the semi-feet of the pentameter
199,A FOREWORD,"constitute what may be called accidental rhyme.  Rhyming Latin verse,"
200,A FOREWORD,"indeed, does not come into existence until the end of the fourth"
201,A FOREWORD,"century, and it is not until the time of the Conquest that end-rhyme"
202,A FOREWORD,"becomes in any way general in English song.  Layman, in translating"
203,A FOREWORD,"Wace's _Le Brut d'Angleterre_, found the original work written in"
204,A FOREWORD,"rhymed lines, and in following that early model produced what is"
205,A FOREWORD,probably the first rhymed poem written in England.
206,A FOREWORD,
207,A FOREWORD,With the introduction of end-rhymes came the discovery that a
208,A FOREWORD,decoration so formal could convert verse into something approaching the
209,A FOREWORD,architectural.  It gave design to the lyric.  With this new
210,A FOREWORD,"definiteness of outline, of course, came a newer rigidity of medium."
211,A FOREWORD,Form was acknowledged as the visible presentation of this particular
212,A FOREWORD,art.  Formal variations became a matter of studious attention.  Efforts
213,A FOREWORD,"were made to leave language in itself instrumental, and in these"
214,A FOREWORD,efforts sound frequently comes perilously near triumphing over sense.
215,A FOREWORD,The exotic formal growths of other languages were imported into
216,A FOREWORD,England.  No verbal _tour de force_ of _troubadour_ or _trouvère_ or
217,A FOREWORD,_jongleur_ or Ronsardist was too fantastic for imitation and adoption.
218,A FOREWORD,The one-time primitive directness of English was overrun by such forms
219,A FOREWORD,"as the ballade, the chant royal, the rondel, the kyrielle, the rondeau"
220,A FOREWORD,"and the rondeau redoublé, the virelai and the pantoum, the sestina, the"
221,A FOREWORD,"villanelle, and last, yet by no means least, the sonnet.  But through"
222,A FOREWORD,the immense tangle of our intricate lyric growths it can now be seen
223,A FOREWORD,"that mere mechanics do not always make poetry.  While rhyme has,"
224,A FOREWORD,"indeed, served its limited purposes, it must be remembered that the"
225,A FOREWORD,highest English verse has been written without rhyme.  This verbal
226,A FOREWORD,"embroidery, while it presents to the workman in words a pleasingly"
227,A FOREWORD,"decorative form, at the same time imposes on him both an adventitious"
228,A FOREWORD,restraint and an increased self-consciousness.  The twentieth century
229,A FOREWORD,"poet, singing with his scrupulously polished vocalisation, usually"
230,A FOREWORD,finds himself content to re-echo what has been said before.  He is
231,A FOREWORD,"unable to ""travel light""; pioneering with so heavy a burden is out of"
232,A FOREWORD,the question.  Rhyme and meter have compelled him to sacrifice content
233,A FOREWORD,for form.  It has left him incapable of what may be called abandonment.
234,A FOREWORD,And the consciousness of his technical impedimenta has limited the
235,A FOREWORD,roads along which he may adventure.  His preoccupation with formal
236,A FOREWORD,exactions has implanted in him an instinctive abhorrence for anything
237,A FOREWORD,beyond the control of what he calls common-sense.  Dominated by this
238,A FOREWORD,"emotional and intellectual timidity, he has attributed to end-rhyme and"
239,A FOREWORD,"accentual rhythm the self-sufficiency of mystic rites, in the face of"
240,A FOREWORD,the fact that the fewer the obstacles between feeling and expression
241,A FOREWORD,"the richer the literary product must be, and forgetting, too, that"
242,A FOREWORD,poetry represents the extreme vanguard of consciousness both
243,A FOREWORD,adventuring and pioneering along the path of future progress.
244,A FOREWORD,
245,A FOREWORD,"For the poet to turn his back on rhythm, as at times he has been able"
246,A FOREWORD,"to do with rhyme, is an impossibility.  For the rhythmising instinct is"
247,A FOREWORD,"innate and persistent in man, standing for a law which permeates every"
248,A FOREWORD,manifestation of energy.  The great heart of Nature itself beats with a
249,A FOREWORD,"regular systole and diastole.  But, rhythmically, the modern versifier"
250,A FOREWORD,has been a Cubist without quite comprehending it.  He has been viewing
251,A FOREWORD,the world mathematically.  He has been crowding his soul into a
252,A FOREWORD,geometrically designed mould.  He has bowed to a rule-of-thumb order of
253,A FOREWORD,"speech, arbitrarily imposed on him by an ancestry which wrung its"
254,A FOREWORD,ingenuous pleasure out of an ingenuous regularity of stress and accent.
255,A FOREWORD,To succeed under that law he must practise an adroit form of
256,A FOREWORD,"self-deception, solemnly pretending to fit his lines to a mould which"
257,A FOREWORD,he actually over-runs and occasionally ignores.  He has not been
258,A FOREWORD,"satisfied with the rhythm of Nature, whose heart-beats in their"
259,A FOREWORD,manifold expressions are omnipresent but never confined to any single
260,A FOREWORD,sustained pulse or any one limited movement.  It is not argued that he
261,A FOREWORD,"should ignore rhythm altogether.  To do so, as has already been said,"
262,A FOREWORD,"would be impossible, since life itself is sustained by the rise and"
263,A FOREWORD,fall of mortal breasts and the beat and throb of mortal hearts.  Rhythm
264,A FOREWORD,is in man's blood.  The ear of the world instinctively searches for
265,A FOREWORD,cadences.  The poet's efforts towards symphonic phrasing have long
266,A FOREWORD,since become habitual and imperative.  But that he should confine
267,A FOREWORD,"himself to certain man-made laws of meter, that he should be shackled"
268,A FOREWORD,"by the prosodian of the past, is quite another matter.  His"
269,A FOREWORD,"predecessors have fashioned many rhythms that are pretty, many"
270,A FOREWORD,"accentual forms that are cunningly intricate, but at a time when his"
271,A FOREWORD,manner of singing has lost its vital swing it is well for man to forget
272,A FOREWORD,these formal prettinesses and equally well to remember that poetry is
273,A FOREWORD,not an intellectual exercise but the immortal soul of perplexed
274,A FOREWORD,mortality seeking expression.
275,A FOREWORD,
276,A FOREWORD,"To abandon fixed rhythm, or meter, for the floating rhythm of the chant"
277,A FOREWORD,may not be an immediate solution of the problem.  To follow the Psalms
278,A FOREWORD,"of David, for example, will not suddenly conjure a new school of verse"
279,A FOREWORD,"into the world.  But to return to the more open movement of the chant,"
280,A FOREWORD,"which is man's natural and rudimentary form of song, may constitute a"
281,A FOREWORD,"step towards freedom.  The mere effort towards emancipation, in fact,"
282,A FOREWORD,is not without its value.  It may serve to impress on certain minds the
283,A FOREWORD,fact that poetry is capable of exhausting one particular form of
284,A FOREWORD,"expression, of incorporating and consuming one particular embodiment of"
285,A FOREWORD,perishable matter and passing on to its newer fields.  Being a living
286,A FOREWORD,"organism, it uses up what lies before it, and to find new vigour must"
287,A FOREWORD,"forever feed on new forms.  Being the product of man's spirit, which is"
288,A FOREWORD,"forever subject to change, verse must not be worshipped for what it has"
289,A FOREWORD,"been, but for what it is capable of being.  No necrophilic regard for"
290,A FOREWORD,its established conventions must blind the lover of beautiful verse to
291,A FOREWORD,the fact that the primary function of poetry is both to intellectualize
292,A FOREWORD,sensation and to elucidate emotional experience.  If man must worship
293,A FOREWORD,"beauty only as he has known it in the past, man must be satisfied with"
294,A FOREWORD,worshipping that which has lived and now is dead.

1001,THE HOUSE OF LIFE,And its corridors dim with age.

1014,ULTIMATA,"I am desolate,"
1015,ULTIMATA,Desolate because of a woman.
1016,ULTIMATA,When at midnight walking alone
1017,ULTIMATA,"I look up at the slow-wheeling stars,"
1018,ULTIMATA,I see only the eyes of this woman.
1019,ULTIMATA,"In bird-haunted valleys and by-ways secluded,"
1020,ULTIMATA,"Where once I sought peace,"
1021,ULTIMATA,I find now only unrest
1022,ULTIMATA,And this one unaltering want.
1023,ULTIMATA,When the dawn-wind stirs in the pine-tops
1024,ULTIMATA,I hear only her voice's whisper.
1025,ULTIMATA,When by day I gaze into the azure above me
1026,ULTIMATA,I see only the face of this woman.
1027,ULTIMATA,"In the sunlight I cannot find comfort,"
1028,ULTIMATA,Nor can I find peace in the shadows.
1029,ULTIMATA,"Neither can I take joy in the hill-wind,"
1030,ULTIMATA,Nor find solace on kindlier breasts;
1031,ULTIMATA,For deep in the eyes of all women I watch
1032,ULTIMATA,I see only her eyes stare back.
1033,ULTIMATA,Nor can I shut the thought of her out of my heart
1034,ULTIMATA,And the ache for her out of my hours.
1035,ULTIMATA,Ruthlessly now she invades even my dreams
1036,ULTIMATA,And wounds me in sleep;
1037,ULTIMATA,"And my body cries out for her,"
1038,ULTIMATA,"Early and late and forever cries out for her,"

1044,ULTIMATA,And mine own people have come to mean naught to me;
1045,ULTIMATA,"And with many about me still am I utterly alone,"
1046,ULTIMATA,And quite solitary now I take my way
1047,ULTIMATA,Where men are intent on puny things
1048,ULTIMATA,And phantasmal legions pace!
1049,ULTIMATA,"And a wearisome thing is life,"
1050,ULTIMATA,And forever the shadow of this one woman
1051,ULTIMATA,Is falling across my path.
1052,ULTIMATA,The turn in the road is a promise of her.
1053,ULTIMATA,The twilight is thronged with her ghosts;
1054,ULTIMATA,"The grasses speak only of her,"
1055,ULTIMATA,The leaves whisper her name forever;
1056,ULTIMATA,The odorous fields are full of her.
1057,ULTIMATA,"Her lips, I keep telling myself,"
1058,ULTIMATA,Are a cup from which I must drink;
1059,ULTIMATA,Her breast is the one last pillow
1060,ULTIMATA,Whereon I may ever find peace!
1061,ULTIMATA,"Yet she has not come to me,"
1062,ULTIMATA,"And being denied her, everything stands denied,"
1063,ULTIMATA,And all men who have waited in vain for love
1064,ULTIMATA,Cry out through my desolate heart;
1065,ULTIMATA,And the want of the hungering world
1066,ULTIMATA,Runs like fire through my veins
1067,ULTIMATA,And bursts from my throat in the cry
1068,ULTIMATA,_That I want this woman!_
1069,ULTIMATA,
1070,ULTIMATA,I am possessed of a great sickness
1071,ULTIMATA,"And likewise possessed of a great strength,"
1072,ULTIMATA,And the ultimate hour has come.
1073,ULTIMATA,"I will arise and go unto this woman,"
1074,ULTIMATA,And with bent head and my arms about her knees
1075,ULTIMATA,"I shall say unto her: ""Beloved beyond all words,"
1076,ULTIMATA,"Others have sought your side,"
1077,ULTIMATA,"And many have craved your kiss,"
1078,ULTIMATA,"But none, O body of flesh and bone,"
1079,ULTIMATA,Has known a hunger like mine!
1080,ULTIMATA,"And though evil befall, or good,"
1081,ULTIMATA,"This hunger is given to me,"
1082,ULTIMATA,"And is now made known to you,--"
1083,ULTIMATA,"For I must die,"

1398,MARCH TWILIGHT,Black with a batter of mud
1399,MARCH TWILIGHT,Stippled with silvery pools
1400,MARCH TWILIGHT,Stands the pavement at the street-end;
1401,MARCH TWILIGHT,And the gutter snow is gone
1402,MARCH TWILIGHT,From cobble and runnelling curb;
1403,MARCH TWILIGHT,And no longer the ramping wind
1404,MARCH TWILIGHT,Is rattling the rusty signs;
1405,MARCH TWILIGHT,And moted and soft and misty
1406,MARCH TWILIGHT,"Hangs the sunlight over the cross-streets,"
1407,MARCH TWILIGHT,And the home-bound crowds of the city
1408,MARCH TWILIGHT,Walk in a flood of gold.
1409,MARCH TWILIGHT,
1410,MARCH TWILIGHT,And suddenly out of the dusk
1411,MARCH TWILIGHT,There comes the ancient question:
1412,MARCH TWILIGHT,Can it be that I have lived
1413,MARCH TWILIGHT,In earlier worlds unknown?
1414,MARCH TWILIGHT,Or is it that somewhere deep
1415,MARCH TWILIGHT,In this husk that men call Me
1416,MARCH TWILIGHT,Are kennelled a motley kin
1417,MARCH TWILIGHT,"I never shall know or name,--"
1418,MARCH TWILIGHT,Are housed still querulous ghosts
1419,MARCH TWILIGHT,"That sigh and awaken and move,"

1433,I,Have all been uttered before.
1434,I,In many another heart
1435,I,"The selfsame song was born,"

1853,PROTESTATIONS,And I in my grief have gazed
1854,PROTESTATIONS,In eyes that were not yours;
1855,PROTESTATIONS,And my emptier hours have known
1856,PROTESTATIONS,"The sigh of kindlier bosoms,"
1857,PROTESTATIONS,The kiss of kindlier mouths!
1858,PROTESTATIONS,"Yet the end of all is written,"
1859,PROTESTATIONS,"And nothing, O rose-leaf woman,"
1860,PROTESTATIONS,You ever may dream or do
1861,PROTESTATIONS,Henceforth can bring me anguish
1862,PROTESTATIONS,Or crown my days with joy!
1863,PROTESTATIONS,
1864,PROTESTATIONS,"_Three tears, O stately woman,"
1865,PROTESTATIONS,"You said could float your soul,"
1866,PROTESTATIONS,So little a thing it seemed!
1867,PROTESTATIONS,Yet all that's left of life
1868,PROTESTATIONS,"I'd give to know your love,"
1869,PROTESTATIONS,"I'd give to show my love,"
1870,PROTESTATIONS,And feel your kiss again!_
1871,PROTESTATIONS,
1872,PROTESTATIONS,
1873,PROTESTATIONS,
1874,PROTESTATIONS,
1875,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT
1876,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1877,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,I sat in the sunlight thinking of life;
1878,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,"I sat there, dreaming of Death."
1879,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,"And a moth alit on the sun-dial's face,"
1880,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,"And the birds sang sleepily,"
1881,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,"And the leaves stirred,"
1882,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,"And the sun lay warm on the hills,"
1883,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,And the afternoon grew old.
1884,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1885,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,"So, some day I knew the birds would sing,"
1886,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,"And the leaves would stir,"
1887,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,And the afternoon grow old--
1888,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,And I would not be there.
1889,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,"And the warmth went out of the day,"
1890,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,"And a wind blew out of the West where I sat,"
1891,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,And the birds were still!
1892,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1893,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1894,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1895,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1896,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1897,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1898,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1899,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1900,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1901,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1902,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1903,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
1904,I SAT IN THE SUNLIGHT,
