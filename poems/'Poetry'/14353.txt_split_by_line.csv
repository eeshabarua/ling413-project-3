33,PREFACE,PREFACE
34,PREFACE,
35,PREFACE,The works of Jonathan Swift in prose and verse so mutually illustrate
36,PREFACE,"each other, that it was deemed indispensable, as a complement to the"
37,PREFACE,"standard edition of the Prose Works, to issue a revised edition of the"
38,PREFACE,"Poems, freed from the errors which had been allowed to creep into the"
39,PREFACE,"text, and illustrated with fuller explanatory notes. My first care,"
40,PREFACE,"therefore, in preparing the Poems for publication, was to collate them"
41,PREFACE,"with the earliest and best editions available, and this I have done."
42,PREFACE,
43,PREFACE,"But, thanks to the diligence of the late John Forster, to whom every"
44,PREFACE,"lover of Swift must confess the very greatest obligation, I have been"
45,PREFACE,able to do much more. I have been able to enrich this edition with some
46,PREFACE,"pieces not hitherto brought to light--notably, the original version of"
47,PREFACE,"""Baucis and Philemon,"" in addition to the version hitherto printed; the"
48,PREFACE,"original version of the poem on ""Vanbrugh's House""; the verses entitled"
49,PREFACE,"""May Fair""; and numerous variations and corrections of the texts of"
50,PREFACE,"nearly all the principal poems, due to Forster's collation of them with"
51,PREFACE,"the transcripts made by Stella, which were found by him at Narford"
52,PREFACE,"formerly the seat of Swift's friend, Sir Andrew Fountaine--see Forster's"
53,PREFACE,"""Life of Swift,"" of which, unfortunately, he lived to publish only the"
54,PREFACE,"first volume. From Swift's own copy of the ""Miscellanies in Prose and"
55,PREFACE,"Verse,"" 1727-32, with notes in his own handwriting, sold at auction last"
56,PREFACE,"year, I was able to make several corrections of the poems contained in"
57,PREFACE,"those four volumes, which serve to show how Swift laboured his works, and"
58,PREFACE,revised and improved them whenever he had an opportunity of doing so. It
59,PREFACE,is a mistake to suppose that he was indifferent to literary fame: on the
60,PREFACE,"contrary, he kept some of his works in manuscript for years in order to"
61,PREFACE,"perfect them for publication, of which ""The Tale of a Tub,"" ""Gulliver's"
62,PREFACE,"Travels,"" and the ""Verses on his own Death"" are examples."
63,PREFACE,
64,PREFACE,"I am indebted to Miss Wilmot-Chetwode, of Wordbrooke, for the loan of a"
65,PREFACE,"manuscript volume, from which I obtained some various readings. By the"
66,PREFACE,"advice of Mr. Elrington Ball, I applied to the librarians of Trinity"
67,PREFACE,"College and of the National Library, and from the latter I received a"
68,PREFACE,number of pieces; but I found that the harvest had already been reaped so
69,PREFACE,"fully, that there was nothing left to glean which could with certainty be"
70,PREFACE,"ascribed to Swift. On the whole, I believe that this edition of the Poems"
71,PREFACE,will be found as complete as it is now possible to make it.
72,PREFACE,
73,PREFACE,"In the arrangement of the poems, I have adopted nearly the same order as"
74,PREFACE,"in the Aldine edition, for the pieces seem to fall naturally into those"
75,PREFACE,"divisions; but with this difference, that I have placed the pieces in"
76,PREFACE,their chronological order in each division. With regard to the notes in
77,PREFACE,"illustration of the text, many of them in the Dublin editions were"
78,PREFACE,"evidently written by Swift, especially the notes to the ""Verses on his"
79,PREFACE,"own Death."" And as to the notes of previous editors, I have retained them"
80,PREFACE,so far as they were useful and correct: but to many of them I have made
81,PREFACE,"additions or alterations wherever, on reference to the authorities cited,"
82,PREFACE,"or to other works, correction became necessary. For my own notes, I can"
83,PREFACE,"only say that I have sought to make them concise, appropriate to the"
84,PREFACE,"text, and, above all, accurate."
85,PREFACE,
86,PREFACE,"Swift and the educated men of his time thought in the classics, and his"
87,PREFACE,"poems, as well as those of his friends, abound with allusions to the"
88,PREFACE,"Greek and Roman authors, especially to the latter. I have given all the"
89,PREFACE,"references, and except in the imitations and paraphrases of so familiar a"
90,PREFACE,"writer as Horace, I have appended the Latin text. Moreover, Swift was,"
91,PREFACE,"like Sterne, very fond of curious and recondite reading, in which it is"
92,PREFACE,not always easy to track him without some research; but I believe that I
93,PREFACE,have not failed to illustrate any matter that required elucidation.

265,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
266,INTRODUCTION,
267,INTRODUCTION,
268,INTRODUCTION,"Dr. Johnson, in his ""Life of Swift,"" after citing with approval Delany's"
269,INTRODUCTION,"character of him, as he describes him to Lord Orrery, proceeds to say:"
270,INTRODUCTION,"""In the poetical works there is not much upon which the critic can"
271,INTRODUCTION,"exercise his powers. They are often humorous, almost always light, and"
272,INTRODUCTION,"have the qualities which recommend such compositions, easiness and"
273,INTRODUCTION,"gaiety. They are, for the most part, what their author intended. The"
274,INTRODUCTION,"diction is correct, the numbers are smooth, and the rhymes exact. There"
275,INTRODUCTION,seldom occurs a hard laboured expression or a redundant epithet; all his
276,INTRODUCTION,verses exemplify his own definition of a good style--they consist of
277,INTRODUCTION,"'proper words in proper places.'"""
278,INTRODUCTION,
279,INTRODUCTION,Of his earliest poems it is needless to say more than that if nothing
280,INTRODUCTION,"better had been written by him than those Pindaric Pieces, after the"
281,INTRODUCTION,"manner of Cowley--then so much in vogue--the remark of Dryden, ""Cousin"
282,INTRODUCTION,"Swift, you will never be a Poet,"" would have been fully justified. But"
283,INTRODUCTION,"conventional praise and compliments were foreign to his nature, for his"
284,INTRODUCTION,strongest characteristic was his intense sincerity. He says of himself
285,INTRODUCTION,that about that time he had writ and burnt and writ again upon all manner
286,INTRODUCTION,of subjects more than perhaps any man in England; and it is certainly
287,INTRODUCTION,"remarkable that in so doing his true genius was not sooner developed, for"
288,INTRODUCTION,it was not till he became chaplain in Lord Berkeley's household that his
289,INTRODUCTION,"satirical humour was first displayed--at least in verse--in ""Mrs. Frances"
290,INTRODUCTION,"Harris' Petition.""--His great prose satires, ""The Tale of a Tub,"" and"
291,INTRODUCTION,"""Gulliver's Travels,"" though planned, were reserved to a later time.--In"
292,INTRODUCTION,"other forms of poetry he soon afterwards greatly excelled, and the title"
293,INTRODUCTION,"of poet cannot be refused to the author of ""Baucis and Philemon""; the"
294,INTRODUCTION,"verses on ""The Death of Dr. Swift""; the ""Rhapsody on Poetry""; ""Cadenus"
295,INTRODUCTION,"and Vanessa""; ""The Legion Club""; and most of the poems addressed to"
296,INTRODUCTION,"Stella, all of which pieces exhibit harmony, invention, and imagination."
297,INTRODUCTION,
298,INTRODUCTION,Swift has been unduly censured for the coarseness of his language upon
299,INTRODUCTION,"Certain topics; but very little of this appears in his earlier poems, and"
300,INTRODUCTION,"what there is, was in accordance with the taste of the period, which"
301,INTRODUCTION,"never hesitated to call a spade a spade, due in part to the reaction from"
302,INTRODUCTION,"the Puritanism of the preceding age, and in part to the outspeaking"
303,INTRODUCTION,"frankness which disdained hypocrisy. It is shown in Dryden, Pope, Prior,"
304,INTRODUCTION,of the last of whom Johnson said that no lady objected to have his poems
305,INTRODUCTION,"in her library; still more in the dramatists of that time, whom Charles"
306,INTRODUCTION,"Lamb has so humorously defended, and in the plays of Mrs. Aphra Behn,"
307,INTRODUCTION,"who, as Pope says, ""fairly puts all characters to bed."" But whatever"
308,INTRODUCTION,"coarseness there may be in some of Swift's poems, such as ""The Lady's"
309,INTRODUCTION,"Dressing Room,"" and a few other pieces, there is nothing licentious,"
310,INTRODUCTION,"nothing which excites to lewdness; on the contrary, such pieces create"
311,INTRODUCTION,"simply a feeling of repulsion. No one, after reading the ""Beautiful young"
312,INTRODUCTION,"Nymph going to bed,"" or ""Strephon and Chloe,"" would desire any personal"
313,INTRODUCTION,"acquaintance with the ladies, but there is a moral in these pieces, and"
314,INTRODUCTION,the latter poem concludes with excellent matrimonial advice. The
315,INTRODUCTION,coarseness of some of his later writings must be ascribed to his
316,INTRODUCTION,"misanthropical hatred of the ""animal called man,"" as expressed in his"
317,INTRODUCTION,"famous letter to Pope of September 1725, aggravated as it was by his"
318,INTRODUCTION,"exile from the friends he loved to a land he hated, and by the reception"
319,INTRODUCTION,"he met with there, about which he speaks very freely in his notes to the"
320,INTRODUCTION,"""Verses on his own Death."""
321,INTRODUCTION,
322,INTRODUCTION,"On the morning of Swift's installation as Dean, the following scurrilous"
323,INTRODUCTION,"lines by Smedley, Dean of Clogher, were affixed to the doors of St."
324,INTRODUCTION,Patrick's Cathedral:
325,INTRODUCTION,
326,INTRODUCTION,To-day this Temple gets a Dean
327,INTRODUCTION,"Of parts and fame uncommon,"
328,INTRODUCTION,"Us'd both to pray and to prophane,"
329,INTRODUCTION,To serve both God and mammon.
330,INTRODUCTION,When Wharton reign'd a Whig he was;
331,INTRODUCTION,"When Pembroke--that's dispute, Sir;"
332,INTRODUCTION,"In Oxford's time, what Oxford pleased,"
333,INTRODUCTION,"Non-con, or Jack, or Neuter."
334,INTRODUCTION,"This place he got by wit and rhime,"
335,INTRODUCTION,"And many ways most odd,"
336,INTRODUCTION,"And might a Bishop be in time,"
337,INTRODUCTION,Did he believe in God.
338,INTRODUCTION,"Look down, St. Patrick, look, we pray,"
339,INTRODUCTION,On thine own church and steeple;
340,INTRODUCTION,"Convert thy Dean on this great day,"
341,INTRODUCTION,Or else God help the people.
342,INTRODUCTION,"And now, whene'er his Deanship dies,"
343,INTRODUCTION,"Upon his stone be graven,"
344,INTRODUCTION,"A man of God here buried lies,"
345,INTRODUCTION,Who never thought of heaven.
346,INTRODUCTION,
347,INTRODUCTION,"It was by these lines that Smedley earned for himself a niche in ""The"
348,INTRODUCTION,"Dunciad."" For Swift's retaliation, see the poems relating to Smedley at"
349,INTRODUCTION,"the end of the first volume, and in volume ii, at p. 124, note."
350,INTRODUCTION,
351,INTRODUCTION,"This bitterness of spirit reached its height in ""Gulliver's Travels,"""
352,INTRODUCTION,"surely the severest of all satires upon humanity, and writ, as he tells"
353,INTRODUCTION,"us, not to divert, but to vex the world; and ultimately, in the fierce"
354,INTRODUCTION,"attack upon the Irish Parliament in the poem entitled ""The Legion Club,"""
355,INTRODUCTION,"dictated by his hatred of tyranny and oppression, and his consequent"
356,INTRODUCTION,passion for exhibiting human nature in its most degraded aspect.
357,INTRODUCTION,
358,INTRODUCTION,"But, notwithstanding his misanthropical feelings towards mankind in"
359,INTRODUCTION,"general, and his ""scorn of fools by fools mistook for pride,"" there never"
360,INTRODUCTION,existed a warmer or sincerer friend to those whom he loved--witness the
361,INTRODUCTION,"regard in which he was held by Oxford, Bolingbroke, Pope, Gay, Arbuthnot,"
362,INTRODUCTION,"and Congreve, and his readiness to assist those who needed his help,"
363,INTRODUCTION,"without thought of party or politics. Although, in some of his poems,"
364,INTRODUCTION,"Swift rather severely exposed the follies and frailties of the fair sex,"
365,INTRODUCTION,"as in ""The Furniture of a Woman's Mind,"" and ""The Journal of a Modern"
366,INTRODUCTION,"Lady,"" he loved the companionship of beautiful and accomplished women,"
367,INTRODUCTION,amongst whom he could count some of his dearest and truest friends; but
368,INTRODUCTION,He loved to be bitter at
369,INTRODUCTION,A lady illiterate;
370,INTRODUCTION,"and therefore delighted in giving them literary instruction, most notably"
371,INTRODUCTION,"in the cases of Stella and Vanessa, whose relations with him arose"
372,INTRODUCTION,"entirely from the tuition in letters which they received from him. Again,"
373,INTRODUCTION,"when on a visit at Sir Arthur Acheson's, he insisted upon making Lady"
374,INTRODUCTION,"Acheson read such books as he thought fit to advise, and in the doggerel"
375,INTRODUCTION,"verses entitled ""My Lady's Lamentation,"" she is supposed to resent his"
376,INTRODUCTION,"""very imperious"" manner of instruction:"
377,INTRODUCTION,
378,INTRODUCTION,No book for delight
379,INTRODUCTION,Must come in my sight;
380,INTRODUCTION,"But instead of new plays,"
381,INTRODUCTION,"Dull Bacon's Essays,"
382,INTRODUCTION,And pore every day on
383,INTRODUCTION,That nasty Pantheon.
384,INTRODUCTION,
385,INTRODUCTION,"As a contrast to his imperiousness, there is an affectionate simplicity"
386,INTRODUCTION,in the fancy names he used to bestow upon his female friends. Sir William
387,INTRODUCTION,"Temple's wife, Dorothea, became Dorinda; Esther Johnson, Stella; Hester"
388,INTRODUCTION,"Vanhomrigh, Vanessa; Lady Winchelsea, Ardelia; while to Lady Acheson he"
389,INTRODUCTION,"gave the nicknames of Skinnybonia, Snipe, and Lean. But all was taken by"
390,INTRODUCTION,them in good part; for his rather dictatorial ways were softened by the
391,INTRODUCTION,fascinating geniality and humour which he knew so well how to employ when
392,INTRODUCTION,"he used to ""deafen them with puns and rhyme."""
393,INTRODUCTION,
394,INTRODUCTION,Into the vexed question of the relations between Swift and Stella I do
395,INTRODUCTION,not purpose to enter further than to record my conviction that she was
396,INTRODUCTION,"never more to him than ""the dearest friend that ever man had."" The"
397,INTRODUCTION,suggestion of a concealed marriage is so inconsistent with their whole
398,INTRODUCTION,"conduct to each other from first to last, that if there had been such a"
399,INTRODUCTION,"marriage, instead of Swift having been, as he was, a man of _intense"
400,INTRODUCTION,"sincerity_, he must be held to have been a most consummate hypocrite."
401,INTRODUCTION,"In my opinion, Churton Collins settled this question in his essays on"
402,INTRODUCTION,"Swift, first published in the ""Quarterly Review,"" 1881 and 1882. Swift's"
403,INTRODUCTION,relation with Vanessa is the saddest episode in his life. The story is
404,INTRODUCTION,"amply told in his poem, ""Cadenus and Vanessa,"" and in the letters which"
405,INTRODUCTION,passed between them: how the pupil became infatuated with her tutor; how
406,INTRODUCTION,"the tutor endeavoured to dispel her passion, but in vain, by reason; and"
407,INTRODUCTION,"how, at last, she died from love for the man who was unable to give love"
408,INTRODUCTION,"in return. That Swift ought, as soon as Hester disclosed her passion for"
409,INTRODUCTION,"him, at once to have broken off the intimacy, must be conceded; but how"
410,INTRODUCTION,many men possessed of his kindness of heart would have had the courage to
411,INTRODUCTION,"have acted otherwise than he did? Swift seems, in fact, to have been"
412,INTRODUCTION,"constitutionally incapable of the _passion_ of love, for he says,"
413,INTRODUCTION,"himself, that he had never met the woman he wished to marry. His annual"
414,INTRODUCTION,tributes to Stella on her birthdays express the strongest regard and
415,INTRODUCTION,"esteem, but he ""ne'er admitted love a guest,"" and he had been so long"
416,INTRODUCTION,"used to this Platonic affection, that he had come to regard women as"
417,INTRODUCTION,"friends, but never as lovers. Stella, on her part, had the same feeling,"
418,INTRODUCTION,"for she never expressed the least discontent at her position, or ever"
419,INTRODUCTION,"regarded Swift otherwise than as her tutor, her counsellor, her friend."
420,INTRODUCTION,"In her verses to him on his birthday, 1721, she says:"
421,INTRODUCTION,
422,INTRODUCTION,Long be the day that gave you birth
423,INTRODUCTION,"Sacred to friendship, wit, and mirth;"
424,INTRODUCTION,Late dying may you cast a shred
425,INTRODUCTION,Of your rich mantle o'er my head;
426,INTRODUCTION,To bear with dignity my sorrow
427,INTRODUCTION,"One day alone, then die tomorrow."
428,INTRODUCTION,
429,INTRODUCTION,"Stella naturally expected to survive Swift, but it was not to be. She"
430,INTRODUCTION,died in the evening of the 28th January 1727-8; and on the same night he
431,INTRODUCTION,"began the affecting piece, ""On the Death of Mrs. Johnson."" (See ""Prose"
432,INTRODUCTION,"Works,"" vol. xi.)"
433,INTRODUCTION,
434,INTRODUCTION,"With the death of Stella, Swift's real happiness ended, and he became"
435,INTRODUCTION,more and more possessed by the melancholy which too often accompanies the
436,INTRODUCTION,"broadest humour, and which, in his case, was constitutional. It was, no"
437,INTRODUCTION,"doubt, to relieve it, that he resorted to the composition of the doggerel"
438,INTRODUCTION,"verses, epigrams, riddles, and trifles exchanged betwixt himself and"
439,INTRODUCTION,"Sheridan, which induced Orrery's remark that ""Swift composing Riddles is"
440,INTRODUCTION,"Titian painting draught-boards;"" on which Delany observes that ""a Riddle"
441,INTRODUCTION,may be as fine painting as any other in the world. It requires as strong
442,INTRODUCTION,"an imagination, as fine colouring, and as exact a proportion and keeping"
443,INTRODUCTION,"as any other historical painting""; and he instances ""Pethox the Great,"""
444,INTRODUCTION,"and should also have alluded to the more learned example--""Louisa to"
445,INTRODUCTION,"Strephon."""
446,INTRODUCTION,
447,INTRODUCTION,"On Orrery's seventh Letter, Delany says that if some of the ""coin is"
448,INTRODUCTION,"base,"" it is the fine impression and polish which adds value to it, and"
449,INTRODUCTION,"cites the saying of another nobleman, that ""there is indeed some stuff"
450,INTRODUCTION,"in it, but it is Swift's stuff."" It has been said that Swift has never"
451,INTRODUCTION,taken a thought from any writer ancient or modern. This is not literally
452,INTRODUCTION,"true, but the instances are not many, and in my notes I have pointed out"
453,INTRODUCTION,"the lines snatched from Milton, Denham, Butler--the last evidently a"
454,INTRODUCTION,great favourite.
455,INTRODUCTION,
456,INTRODUCTION,It seems necessary to state shortly the causes of Swift not having
457,INTRODUCTION,obtained higher preferment. Besides that Queen Anne would never be
458,INTRODUCTION,"reconciled to the author of the ""Tale of a Tub""--the true purport of"
459,INTRODUCTION,which was so ill-understood by her--he made an irreconcilable enemy of
460,INTRODUCTION,"her friend, the Duchess of Somerset, by his lampoon entitled ""The Windsor"
461,INTRODUCTION,"Prophecy."" But Swift seldom allowed prudence to restrain his wit and"
462,INTRODUCTION,"humour, and admits of himself that he ""had too much satire in his vein"";"
463,INTRODUCTION,"and that ""a genius in the reverend gown must ever keep its owner down"";"
464,INTRODUCTION,and says further:
465,INTRODUCTION,
466,INTRODUCTION,Humour and mirth had place in all he writ;
467,INTRODUCTION,He reconciled divinity and wit.
468,INTRODUCTION,
469,INTRODUCTION,But that was what his enemies could not do.
470,INTRODUCTION,
471,INTRODUCTION,"Whatever the excellences and defects of the poems, Swift has erected, not"
472,INTRODUCTION,"only by his works, but by his benevolence and his charities, a"
473,INTRODUCTION,"_monumentum aere perennius,_ and his writings in prose and verse"
474,INTRODUCTION,will continue to afford instruction and delight when the malevolence of
475,INTRODUCTION,"Jeffrey, the misrepresentations of Macaulay, and the sneers and false"
476,INTRODUCTION,statements of Thackeray shall have been forgotten.

525,II,"In its reception to the eye,"

527,II,"The figures all inverted show,"

681,VIII,I mean the way which leads to Christ:
682,VIII,"Mistaken idiots! see how giddily they run,"
683,VIII,"Led blindly on by avarice and pride,"
684,VIII,What mighty numbers follow them;
685,VIII,Each fond of erring with his guide:

687,VIII,"In Caesar's court, or in Jerusalem:"
688,VIII,"Others, ignorantly wise,"

731,X,Fortune in both extremes

1339,VII,"Because, alas! when we all die,"
1340,VII,"Careless and ignorant posterity,"
1341,VII,"Although they praise the learning and the wit,"

1349,VII,Is at a loss for figures to express
1350,VII,"Men's folly, whimseys, and inconstancy,"
1351,VII,And by a faint description makes them less.
1352,VII,"Then tell us what is Fame, where shall we search for it?"
1353,VII,"Look where exalted Virtue and Religion sit,"
1354,VII,Enthroned with heavenly Wit!
1355,VII,Look where you see
1356,VII,The greatest scorn of learned vanity!
1357,VII,(And then how much a nothing is mankind!
1358,VII,"Whose reason is weigh'd down by popular air,"
1359,VII,"Who, by that, vainly talks of baffling death;"
1360,VII,"And hopes to lengthen life by a transfusion of breath,"
1361,VII,Which yet whoe'er examines right will find
1362,VII,To be an art as vain as bottling up of wind!)

1410,IX,With a long sweeping train
1411,IX,"Of comments and disputes, ridiculous and vain,"
1412,IX,All of old cut with a new dye:

1414,IX,"And rid her of her lumber and her books,"

1437,X,The fatal time when that could be!)
1438,X,Have even increased their pride and cruelty.
1439,X,"Woman seems now above all vanity grown,"
1440,X,Still boasting of her great unknown
1441,X,"Platonic champions, gain'd without one female wile,"

1468,XI,"I grieve, this nobler work, most happily begun,"

1478,XI,E'er flourished under a successor or a son;
1479,XI,"It lost some mighty pieces through all hands it pass'd,"

1727,"WRITTEN IN NOVEMBER, 1693","Here, on a better day, some druid dwelt,"

4201,CHARIOT,Drawn damnably low by your sorrel mare.
4202,CHARIOT,We know how your lady was on you befriended;

5696,VIRG.,
5697,VIRG.,"Five hundred chariots just bespoke,"
5698,VIRG.,"Are sunk in these devouring waves,"
5699,VIRG.,"The horses drown'd, the harness broke,"
5700,VIRG.,And here the owners find their graves.
5701,VIRG.,
5702,VIRG.,"Like Pharaoh, by directors led,"
5703,VIRG.,They with their spoils went safe before;
5704,VIRG.,"His chariots, tumbling out the dead,"
5705,VIRG.,Lay shatter'd on the Red Sea shore.
5706,VIRG.,
5707,VIRG.,"Raised up on Hope's aspiring plumes,"
5708,VIRG.,The young adventurer o'er the deep
5709,VIRG.,"An eagle's flight and state assumes,"
5710,VIRG.,And scorns the middle way to keep.
5711,VIRG.,
5712,VIRG.,"On paper wings he takes his flight,"
5713,VIRG.,With wax the father bound them fast;
5714,VIRG.,"The wax is melted by the height,"
5715,VIRG.,And down the towering boy is cast.
5716,VIRG.,
5717,VIRG.,A moralist might here explain
5718,VIRG.,The rashness of the Cretan youth;[1]
5719,VIRG.,"Describe his fall into the main,"
5720,VIRG.,And from a fable form a truth.
5721,VIRG.,
5722,VIRG.,"His wings are his paternal rent,"
5723,VIRG.,He melts the wax at every flame;
5724,VIRG.,"His credit sunk, his money spent,"
5725,VIRG.,In Southern Seas he leaves his name.
5726,VIRG.,
5727,VIRG.,"Inform us, you that best can tell,"
5728,VIRG.,"Why in that dangerous gulf profound,"
5729,VIRG.,"Where hundreds and where thousands fell,"
5730,VIRG.,"Fools chiefly float, the wise are drown'd?"
5731,VIRG.,
5732,VIRG.,So have I seen from Severn's brink
5733,VIRG.,A flock of geese jump down together;
5734,VIRG.,"Swim where the bird of Jove would sink,"
5735,VIRG.,"And, swimming, never wet a feather."
5736,VIRG.,
5737,VIRG.,"But, I affirm, 'tis false in fact,"
5738,VIRG.,Directors better knew their tools;
5739,VIRG.,"We see the nation's credit crack'd,"
5740,VIRG.,Each knave has made a thousand fools.
5741,VIRG.,
5742,VIRG.,"One fool may from another win,"
5743,VIRG.,And then get off with money stored;
5744,VIRG.,"But, if a sharper once comes in,"
5745,VIRG.,"He throws it all, and sweeps the board."
5746,VIRG.,
5747,VIRG.,"As fishes on each other prey,"
5748,VIRG.,"The great ones swallowing up the small,"
5749,VIRG.,So fares it in the Southern Sea;
5750,VIRG.,The whale directors eat up all.
5751,VIRG.,
5752,VIRG.,"When stock is high, they come between,"
5753,VIRG.,Making by second-hand their offers;
5754,VIRG.,"Then cunningly retire unseen,"
5755,VIRG.,With each a million in his coffers.
5756,VIRG.,
5757,VIRG.,"So, when upon a moonshine night,"
5758,VIRG.,"An ass was drinking at a stream,"
5759,VIRG.,"A cloud arose, and stopt the light,"
5760,VIRG.,By intercepting every beam:
5761,VIRG.,
5762,VIRG.,"The day of judgment will be soon,"
5763,VIRG.,Cries out a sage among the crowd;
5764,VIRG.,An ass has swallow'd up the moon!
5765,VIRG.,The moon lay safe behind the cloud.
5766,VIRG.,
5767,VIRG.,Each poor subscriber to the sea
5768,VIRG.,"Sinks down at once, and there he lies;"
5769,VIRG.,"Directors fall as well as they,"
5770,VIRG.,Their fall is but a trick to rise.
5771,VIRG.,
5772,VIRG.,"So fishes, rising from the main,"
5773,VIRG.,Can soar with moisten'd wings on high;
5774,VIRG.,"The moisture dried, they sink again,"
5775,VIRG.,And dip their fins again to fly.
5776,VIRG.,
5777,VIRG.,"Undone at play, the female troops"
5778,VIRG.,Come here their losses to retrieve;
5779,VIRG.,"Ride o'er the waves in spacious hoops,"
5780,VIRG.,Like Lapland witches in a sieve.
5781,VIRG.,
5782,VIRG.,"Thus Venus to the sea descends,"
5783,VIRG.,As poets feign; but where's the moral?
5784,VIRG.,It shows the Queen of Love intends
5785,VIRG.,To search the deep for pearl and coral.
5786,VIRG.,
5787,VIRG.,"The sea is richer than the land,"
5788,VIRG.,"I heard it from my grannam's mouth,"
5789,VIRG.,Which now I clearly understand;
5790,VIRG.,For by the sea she meant the South.
5791,VIRG.,
5792,VIRG.,"Thus, by directors we are told,"
5793,VIRG.,"""Pray, gentlemen, believe your eyes;"
5794,VIRG.,"Our ocean's cover'd o'er with gold,"
5795,VIRG.,"Look round, and see how thick it lies:"
5796,VIRG.,
5797,VIRG.,"""We, gentlemen, are your assisters,"
5798,VIRG.,"We'll come, and hold you by the chin.""--"
5799,VIRG.,"Alas! all is not gold that glisters,"
5800,VIRG.,Ten thousand sink by leaping in.
5801,VIRG.,
5802,VIRG.,"O! would those patriots be so kind,"
5803,VIRG.,"Here in the deep to wash their hands,"
5804,VIRG.,"Then, like Pactolus,[2] we should find"
5805,VIRG.,The sea indeed had golden sands.
5806,VIRG.,
5807,VIRG.,"A shilling in the bath you fling,"
5808,VIRG.,"The silver takes a nobler hue,"
5809,VIRG.,"By magic virtue in the spring,"
5810,VIRG.,And seems a guinea to your view.
5811,VIRG.,
5812,VIRG.,"But, as a guinea will not pass"
5813,VIRG.,"At market for a farthing more,"
5814,VIRG.,"Shown through a multiplying glass,"
5815,VIRG.,Than what it always did before:
5816,VIRG.,
5817,VIRG.,"So cast it in the Southern seas,"
5818,VIRG.,Or view it through a jobber's bill;
5819,VIRG.,"Put on what spectacles you please,"
5820,VIRG.,Your guinea's but a guinea still.
5821,VIRG.,
5822,VIRG.,One night a fool into a brook
5823,VIRG.,"Thus from a hillock looking down,"
5824,VIRG.,"The golden stars for guineas took,"
5825,VIRG.,And silver Cynthia for a crown.
5826,VIRG.,
5827,VIRG.,The point he could no longer doubt;
5828,VIRG.,"He ran, he leapt into the flood;"
5829,VIRG.,"There sprawl'd a while, and scarce got out,"
5830,VIRG.,All cover'd o'er with slime and mud.
5831,VIRG.,
5832,VIRG.,"""Upon the water cast thy bread,"
5833,VIRG.,"And after many days thou'lt find it;""[3]"
5834,VIRG.,"But gold, upon this ocean spread,"
5835,VIRG.,"Shall sink, and leave no mark behind it:"
5836,VIRG.,
5837,VIRG.,"There is a gulf, where thousands fell,"
5838,VIRG.,"Here all the bold adventurers came,"
5839,VIRG.,"A narrow sound, though deep as Hell--"
5840,VIRG.,'Change Alley is the dreadful name.
5841,VIRG.,
5842,VIRG.,"Nine times a-day it ebbs and flows,"
5843,VIRG.,"Yet he that on the surface lies,"
5844,VIRG.,Without a pilot seldom knows
5845,VIRG.,"The time it falls, or when 'twill rise."
5846,VIRG.,
5847,VIRG.,"Subscribers here by thousands float,"
5848,VIRG.,And jostle one another down;
5849,VIRG.,"Each paddling in his leaky boat,"
5850,VIRG.,"And here they fish for gold, and drown."
5851,VIRG.,
5852,VIRG.,"""Now buried in the depth below,"
5853,VIRG.,"Now mounted up to Heaven again,"
5854,VIRG.,"They reel and stagger to and fro,"
5855,VIRG.,"At their wits' end, like drunken men.""[4]"
5856,VIRG.,
5857,VIRG.,"Meantime, secure on Garway[5] cliffs,"
5858,VIRG.,"A savage race, by shipwrecks fed,"
5859,VIRG.,"Lie waiting for the founder'd skiffs,"
5860,VIRG.,And strip the bodies of the dead.
5861,VIRG.,
5862,VIRG.,"But these, you say, are factious lies,"
5863,VIRG.,From some malicious Tory's brain;
5864,VIRG.,"For, where directors get a prize,"
5865,VIRG.,The Swiss and Dutch whole millions drain.
5866,VIRG.,
5867,VIRG.,"Thus, when by rooks a lord is plied,"
5868,VIRG.,"Some cully often wins a bet,"
5869,VIRG.,"By venturing on the cheating side,"
5870,VIRG.,Though not into the secret let.
5871,VIRG.,
5872,VIRG.,"While some build castles in the air,"
5873,VIRG.,Directors build them in the seas;
5874,VIRG.,"Subscribers plainly see them there,"
5875,VIRG.,For fools will see as wise men please.
5876,VIRG.,
5877,VIRG.,Thus oft by mariners are shown
5878,VIRG.,(Unless the men of Kent are liars)
5879,VIRG.,"Earl Godwin's castles overflown,"
5880,VIRG.,"And palace roofs, and steeple spires."
5881,VIRG.,
5882,VIRG.,"Mark where the sly directors creep,"
5883,VIRG.,Nor to the shore approach too nigh!
5884,VIRG.,"The monsters nestle in the deep,"
5885,VIRG.,To seize you in your passing by.
5886,VIRG.,
5887,VIRG.,"Then, like the dogs of Nile, be wise,"
5888,VIRG.,"Who, taught by instinct how to shun"
5889,VIRG.,"The crocodile, that lurking lies,"
5890,VIRG.,"Run as they drink, and drink and run."
5891,VIRG.,
5892,VIRG.,"Antæus could, by magic charms,"
5893,VIRG.,Recover strength whene'er he fell;
5894,VIRG.,"Alcides held him in his arms,"
5895,VIRG.,And sent him up in air to Hell.
5896,VIRG.,
5897,VIRG.,"Directors, thrown into the sea,"
5898,VIRG.,Recover strength and vigour there;
5899,VIRG.,"But may be tamed another way,"
5900,VIRG.,Suspended for a while in air.
5901,VIRG.,
5902,VIRG.,"Directors! for 'tis you I warn,"
5903,VIRG.,By long experience we have found
5904,VIRG.,What planet ruled when you were born;
5905,VIRG.,We see you never can be drown'd.
5906,VIRG.,
5907,VIRG.,"Beware, nor overbulky grow,"
5908,VIRG.,Nor come within your cully's reach;
5909,VIRG.,"For, if the sea should sink so low"
5910,VIRG.,"To leave you dry upon the beach,"
5911,VIRG.,
5912,VIRG.,You'll owe your ruin to your bulk:
5913,VIRG.,"Your foes already waiting stand,"
5914,VIRG.,"To tear you like a founder'd hulk,"
5915,VIRG.,While you lie helpless on the sand.
5916,VIRG.,
5917,VIRG.,"Thus, when a whale has lost the tide,"
5918,VIRG.,The coasters crowd to seize the spoil:
5919,VIRG.,"The monster into parts divide,"
5920,VIRG.,"And strip the bones, and melt the oil."
5921,VIRG.,
5922,VIRG.,Oh! may some western tempest sweep
5923,VIRG.,"These locusts whom our fruits have fed,"
5924,VIRG.,"That plague, directors, to the deep,"
5925,VIRG.,Driven from the South Sea to the Red!
5926,VIRG.,
5927,VIRG.,"May he, whom Nature's laws obey,"
5928,VIRG.,"Who lifts the poor, and sinks the proud,"
5929,VIRG.,"""Quiet the raging of the sea,"
5930,VIRG.,"And still the madness of the crowd!"""
5931,VIRG.,
5932,VIRG.,"But never shall our isle have rest,"
5933,VIRG.,"Till those devouring swine run down,"
5934,VIRG.,(The devils leaving the possest)
5935,VIRG.,And headlong in the waters drown.
5936,VIRG.,

6067,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",And yet has been fed by a benefit-night.
6068,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","The custom is frequent, on my word I assure ye,"
6069,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","In our famed elder house, of the Hundreds of Drury."
6070,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","But then you must know, those players still act on"
6071,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","Some very good reasons, for such benefaction."
6072,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","A deceased poet's widow, if pretty, can't fail;"
6073,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","From Cibber she holds, as a tenant in tail."
6074,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","Your emerited actors, and actresses too,"
6075,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",For what they have done (though no more they can do)
6076,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","And sitters, and songsters, and Chetwood and G----,"
6077,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",And sometimes a poor sufferer in the South Sea;
6078,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","A machine-man, a tire-woman, a mute, and a spright,"
6079,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",Have been all kept from starving by a benefit-night.
6080,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","Thus, for Hoppy's bright merits, at length we have found"
6081,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","That he must have of us ninety-nine and one pound,"
6082,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",Paid to him clear money once every year:
6083,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","And however some think it a little too dear,"
6084,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","Yet, for reasons of state, this sum we'll allow,"
6085,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",Though we pay the good man with the sweat of our brow.
6086,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","First, because by the King to us he was sent,"
6087,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",To guide the whole session of this parliament.
6088,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","To preside in our councils, both public and private,"
6089,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","And so learn, by the by, what both houses do drive at."
6090,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","When bold B---- roars, and meek M---- raves,"
6091,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","When Ash prates by wholesale, or Be----h by halves,"
6092,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","When Whigs become Whims, or join with the Tories;"
6093,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","And to himself constant when a member no more is,"
6094,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","But changes his sides, and votes and unvotes;"
6095,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","As S----t is dull, and with S----d, who dotes;"
6096,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","Then up must get Hoppy, and with voice very low,"
6097,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","And with eloquent bow, the house he must show,"
6098,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",That that worthy member who spoke last must give
6099,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","The freedom to him, humbly most, to conceive,"
6100,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",That his sentiment on this affair isn't right;
6101,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",That he mightily wonders which way he came by't:
6102,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","That, for his part, God knows, he does such things disown;"
6103,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","And so, having convinced him, he most humbly sits down."
6104,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","For these, and more reasons, which perhaps you may hear,"
6105,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","Pounds hundred this night, and one hundred this year,"
6106,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","And so on we are forced, though we sweat out our blood,"
6107,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",To make these walls pay for poor Hoppy's good;
6108,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",To supply with rare diet his pot and his spit;
6109,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",And with richest Margoux to wash down a tit-bit.
6110,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","To wash oft his fine linen, so clean and so neat,"
6111,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","And to buy him much linen, to fence against sweat:"
6112,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",All which he deserves; for although all the day
6113,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","He ofttimes is heavy, yet all night he's gay;"
6114,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","And if he rise early to watch for the state,"
6115,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",To keep up his spirits he'll sit up as late.
6116,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","Thus, for these and more reasons, as before I did say"
6117,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY","Hop has got all the money for our acting this play,"
6118,"TO MR. HOPPY'S BENEFIT-NIGHT, AT SMOCK-ALLEY",Which makes us poor actors look _je ne sçai quoy_.

6145,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"Their pockets empty, and their stomachs sharp."
6146,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"Provoked, in loud complaints to you they cry;"
6147,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"Ladies, relieve the weavers; or they die!"
6148,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,Forsake your silks for stuff's; nor think it strange
6149,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"To shift your clothes, since you delight in change."
6150,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,One thing with freedom I'll presume to tell--
6151,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,The men will like you every bit as well.
6152,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"See I am dress'd from top to toe in stuff,"
6153,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"And, by my troth, I think I'm fine enough;"
6154,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"My wife admires me more, and swears she never,"
6155,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"In any dress, beheld me look so clever."

6157,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,What great advantage must it give the fair!
6158,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,Our wool from lambs of innocence proceeds;
6159,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"Silks come from maggots, calicoes from weeds;"
6160,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,Hence 'tis by sad experience that we find
6161,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,Ladies in silks to vapours much inclined--
6162,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,And what are they but maggots in the mind?
6163,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"For which I think it reason to conclude,"
6164,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,That clothes may change our temper like our food.
6165,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"Chintzes are gawdy, and engage our eyes"
6166,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,Too much about the party-colour'd dyes;
6167,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"Although the lustre is from you begun,"
6168,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"We see the rainbow, and neglect the sun."
6169,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"How sweet and innocent's the country maid,"
6170,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,With small expense in native wool array'd;
6171,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"Who copies from the fields her homely green,"
6172,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,While by her shepherd with delight she's seen!
6173,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"Should our fair ladies dress like her, in wool"
6174,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"How much more lovely, and how beautiful,"
6175,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,"Without their Indian drapery, they'd prove!"
6176,BY DR. SHERIDAN. SPOKEN BY MR. ELRINGTON. 1721,While wool would help to warm us into love!

6200,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,The poet had no more who made the play.
6201,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,But whence this wondrous charity in players?
6202,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"They learn it not at sermons, or at prayers:"
6203,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"Under the rose, since here are none but friends,"
6204,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,(To own the truth) we have some private ends.
6205,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"Since waiting-women, like exacting jades,"
6206,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,Hold up the prices of their old brocades;
6207,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,We'll dress in manufactures made at home;
6208,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,Equip our kings and generals at the Comb.[2]
6209,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,We'll rig from Meath Street Egypt's haughty queen
6210,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,And Antony shall court her in ratteen.
6211,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"In blue shalloon shall Hannibal be clad,"

6213,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"In drugget drest, of thirteen pence a-yard,"
6214,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,See Philip's son amidst his Persian guard;
6215,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"And proud Roxana, fired with jealous rage,"
6216,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,With fifty yards of crape shall sweep the stage.
6217,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"In short, our kings and princesses within"
6218,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,Are all resolved this project to begin;
6219,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"And you, our subjects, when you here resort,"
6220,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,Must imitate the fashion of the court.
6221,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"O! could I see this audience clad in stuff,"
6222,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"Though money's scarce, we should have trade enough:"
6223,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"But chintz, brocades, and lace, take all away,"
6224,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,And scarce a crown is left to see the play.
6225,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,Perhaps you wonder whence this friendship springs
6226,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,Between the weavers and us playhouse kings;
6227,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,But wit and weaving had the same beginning;
6228,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,Pallas[3] first taught us poetry and spinning:
6229,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"And, next, observe how this alliance fits,"
6230,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,For weavers now are just as poor as wits:
6231,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"Their brother quillmen, workers for the stage,"
6232,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,For sorry stuff can get a crown a page;
6233,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"But weavers will be kinder to the players,"
6234,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,And sell for twenty pence a yard of theirs.
6235,BY THE DEAN. SPOKEN BY MR. GRIFFITH,"And to your knowledge, there is often less in"

6398,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Dan, growing drowsy, like a thief"
6399,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,Steals off to doze away his beef;
6400,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,And this must pass for reading Hammond--
6401,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,While George and Dean go to backgammon.
6402,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"George, Nim, and Dean, set out at four,"
6403,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"And then, again, boys, to the oar."

6409,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,And leave the flood when he goes in it.
6410,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Now stinted in the shortening day,"
6411,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"We go to prayers and then to play,"
6412,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,Till supper comes; and after that

6414,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"'Tis late--the old and younger pairs,"
6415,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"By Adam[3] lighted, walk up stairs."

6418,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"So when the circle we have run,"
6419,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,The curtain falls and all is done.
6420,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"I might have mention'd several facts,"

6422,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"And tell who loses and who wins,"
6423,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Who gets a cold, who breaks his shins;"
6424,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"How Dan caught nothing in his net,"
6425,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,And how the boat was overset.
6426,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,For brevity I have retrench'd
6427,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,How in the lake the Dean was drench'd:
6428,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"It would be an exploit to brag on,"
6429,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,How valiant George rode o'er the Dragon;
6430,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"How steady in the storm he sat,"
6431,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"And saved his oar, but lost his hat:"
6432,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,How Nim (no hunter e'er could match him)
6433,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Still brings us hares, when he can catch 'em;"
6434,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,How skilfully Dan mends his nets;
6435,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,How fortune fails him when he sets;
6436,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,Or how the Dean delights to vex
6437,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"The ladies, and lampoon their sex:"
6438,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,I might have told how oft Dean Perceval
6439,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Displays his pedantry unmerciful,"
6440,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"How haughtily he cocks his nose,"
6441,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,To tell what every schoolboy knows:
6442,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"And with his finger and his thumb,"
6443,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Explaining, strikes opposers dumb:"
6444,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"But now there needs no more be said on't,"
6445,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Nor how his wife, that female pedant,"
6446,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,Shews all her secrets of housekeeping:
6447,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,For candles how she trucks her dripping;
6448,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Was forced to send three miles for yeast,"
6449,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"To brew her ale, and raise her paste;"
6450,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Tells everything that you can think of,"
6451,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,How she cured Charley of the chincough;
6452,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"What gave her brats and pigs the measles,"
6453,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,And how her doves were killed by weasels;
6454,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"How Jowler howl'd, and what a fright"
6455,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,She had with dreams the other night.
6456,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"But now, since I have gone so far on,"
6457,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,A word or two of Lord Chief Baron;
6458,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,And tell how little weight he sets
6459,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,On all Whig papers and gazettes;
6460,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"But for the politics of Pue,[4]"
6461,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,Thinks every syllable is true:
6462,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,And since he owns the King of Sweden [5]
6463,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Is dead at last, without evading,"
6464,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,Now all his hopes are in the czar;
6465,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"""Why, Muscovy is not so far;"
6466,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Down the Black Sea, and up the Straits,"
6467,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,And in a month he's at your gates;
6468,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Perhaps from what the packet brings,"
6469,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"By Christmas we shall see strange things."""
6470,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Why should I tell of ponds and drains,"
6471,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,What carps we met with for our pains;
6472,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Of sparrows tamed, and nuts innumerable"
6473,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"To choke the girls, and to consume a rabble?"
6474,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"But you, who are a scholar, know"
6475,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"How transient all things are below,"
6476,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,How prone to change is human life!
6477,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,Last night arrived Clem[6] and his wife--
6478,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,This grand event has broke our measures;
6479,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,Their reign began with cruel seizures;
6480,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,The Dean must with his quilt supply
6481,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,The bed in which those tyrants lie;
6482,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Nim lost his wig-block, Dan his Jordan,"
6483,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"(My lady says, she can't afford one,)"
6484,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"George is half scared out of his wits,"
6485,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,For Clem gets all the dainty bits.
6486,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"Henceforth expect a different survey,"
6487,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,This house will soon turn topsyturvy;
6488,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,"They talk of farther alterations,"
6489,DRAMATIS PERSONAE,Which causes many speculations.

6520,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"A single crow can make it night,"
6521,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],When o'er your farm she takes her flight:
6522,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"Yet, in this narrow compass, we"

6524,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"Both walks, walls, meadows, and parterres,"
6525,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"Windows and doors, and rooms and stairs,"
6526,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"And hills and dales, and woods and fields,"

6530,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"A razor, though to say't I'm loth,"
6531,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],Would shave you and your meadows both.
6532,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"Though small's the farm, yet here's a house"
6533,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],Full large to entertain a mouse;
6534,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],But where a rat is dreaded more
6535,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],Than savage Caledonian boar;
6536,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"For, if it's enter'd by a rat,"

6540,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"Like tears adown a wrinkled cheek,"
6541,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],Like rain along a blade of leek:
6542,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"And this you call your sweet meander,"
6543,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"Which might be suck'd up by a gander,"
6544,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],Could he but force his nether bill
6545,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],To scoop the channel of the rill.
6546,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"For sure you'd make a mighty clutter,"

6549,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],Where one poor mouse would fare but hard in;
6550,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],And round this garden is a walk
6551,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],No longer than a tailor's chalk;
6552,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"Thus I compare what space is in it,"
6553,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],A snail creeps round it in a minute.
6554,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],One lettuce makes a shift to squeeze
6555,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],Up through a tuft you call your trees:
6556,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"And, once a year, a single rose"
6557,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],"Peeps from the bud, but never blows;"
6558,DR. DELANY'S VILLA[1],In vain then you expect its bloom!

6689,ON MR. FORD[1],"And, whispering, charged me not to say"

6694,ON MR. FORD[1],Be sure conceal the time and place;
6695,ON MR. FORD[1],"And not my compliment to spoil,"
6696,ON MR. FORD[1],By calling this your native soil;
6697,ON MR. FORD[1],"Or vex the ladies, when they knew"
6698,ON MR. FORD[1],That you are turning forty-two:

6701,ON MR. FORD[1],"I think, though you judge hardly of it,"
6702,ON MR. FORD[1],Good manners must give place to profit.
6703,ON MR. FORD[1],"The nymphs, with whom you first began,"
6704,ON MR. FORD[1],Are each become a harridan;
6705,ON MR. FORD[1],"And Montague so far decay'd,"
6706,ON MR. FORD[1],Her lovers now must all be paid;
6707,ON MR. FORD[1],"And every belle that since arose,"

6738,ON MR. FORD[1],When fortune hither drove me first;

6740,ON MR. FORD[1],Nor persons' names nor places knew:
6741,ON MR. FORD[1],"But now I act as other folk,"
6742,ON MR. FORD[1],Like prisoners when their gaol is broke.
6743,ON MR. FORD[1],"If you have London still at heart,"

6745,ON MR. FORD[1],The difference is not much between
6746,ON MR. FORD[1],St. James's Park and Stephen's Green;
6747,ON MR. FORD[1],And Dawson Street will serve as well
6748,ON MR. FORD[1],To lead you thither as Pall Mall.
6749,ON MR. FORD[1],"Nor want a passage through the palace,"
6750,ON MR. FORD[1],"To choke your sight, and raise your malice."
6751,ON MR. FORD[1],"The Deanery-house may well be match'd,"
6752,ON MR. FORD[1],"Under correction, with the Thatch'd.[2]"
6753,ON MR. FORD[1],"Nor shall I, when you hither come,"
6754,ON MR. FORD[1],Demand a crown a-quart for stum.
6755,ON MR. FORD[1],"Then for a middle-aged charmer,"

6758,ON MR. FORD[1],And has a thousand times her wit
6759,ON MR. FORD[1],"The Dean and Sheridan, I hope,"
6760,ON MR. FORD[1],Will half supply a Gay and Pope.
6761,ON MR. FORD[1],"Corbet,[4] though yet I know his worth not,"
6762,ON MR. FORD[1],"No doubt, will prove a good Arbuthnot."
6763,ON MR. FORD[1],I throw into the bargain Tim;

6765,ON MR. FORD[1],"What think you of my favourite clan,"

6767,ON MR. FORD[1],"Fellows of modest worth and parts,"
6768,ON MR. FORD[1],With cheerful looks and honest hearts?
6769,ON MR. FORD[1],Can you on Dublin look with scorn?
6770,ON MR. FORD[1],Yet here were you and Ormond born.
6771,ON MR. FORD[1],"O! were but you and I so wise,"
6772,ON MR. FORD[1],To see with Robert Grattan's eyes!
6773,ON MR. FORD[1],"Robin adores that spot of earth,"
6774,ON MR. FORD[1],That literal spot which gave him birth;
6775,ON MR. FORD[1],"And swears, ""Belcamp[6] is, to his taste,"

6780,ON MR. FORD[1],"We gladly hear you, and submit;"

6782,ON MR. FORD[1],"For this or that side of a gutter,"
6783,ON MR. FORD[1],"To live in this or t'other isle,"
6784,ON MR. FORD[1],We cannot think it worth your while;
6785,ON MR. FORD[1],"For, take it kindly or amiss,"
6786,ON MR. FORD[1],"The difference but amounts to this,"
6787,ON MR. FORD[1],We bury on our side the channel
6788,ON MR. FORD[1],In linen; and on yours in flannel.[7]
6789,ON MR. FORD[1],You for the news are ne'er to seek;
6790,ON MR. FORD[1],"While we, perhaps, may wait a week;"
6791,ON MR. FORD[1],You happy folks are sure to meet
6792,ON MR. FORD[1],A hundred whores in every street;
6793,ON MR. FORD[1],While we may trace all Dublin o'er
6794,ON MR. FORD[1],Before we find out half a score.
6795,ON MR. FORD[1],"You see my arguments are strong,"
6796,ON MR. FORD[1],I wonder you held out so long;

7316,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"But still at variance with each other,"
7317,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,Were seen contending in a race;

7319,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"'Tis said, their course continued long,"
7320,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"For this was active, that was strong:"
7321,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Till Envy, Slander, Sloth, and Doubt,"
7322,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,Misled them many a league about;
7323,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Seduced by some deceiving light,"

7327,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Desire, the swifter of the two,"
7328,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,Along the plain like lightning flew:
7329,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Till, entering on a broad highway,"
7330,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Where power and titles scatter'd lay,"
7331,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"He strove to pick up all he found,"
7332,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,And by excursions lost his ground:
7333,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"No sooner got, than with disdain"
7334,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,He threw them on the ground again;
7335,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,And hasted forward to pursue
7336,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Fresh objects, fairer to his view,"
7337,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,In hope to spring some nobler game;
7338,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,But all he took was just the same:
7339,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Too scornful now to stop his pace,"
7340,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,He spurn'd them in his rival's face.
7341,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Possession kept the beaten road,"
7342,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,And gather'd all his brother strew'd;

7345,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,Desire had now the goal in sight;
7346,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,It was a tower of monstrous height;
7347,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Where on the summit Fortune stands,"
7348,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,A crown and sceptre in her hands;
7349,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Beneath, a chasm as deep as Hell,"
7350,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,Where many a bold adventurer fell.
7351,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Desire, in rapture, gazed awhile,"
7352,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,And saw the treacherous goddess smile;
7353,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"But as he climb'd to grasp the crown,"
7354,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,She knock'd him with the sceptre down!
7355,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,He tumbled in the gulf profound;
7356,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,There doom'd to whirl an endless round.
7357,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"Possession's load was grown so great,"
7358,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,He sunk beneath the cumbrous weight;
7359,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"And, as he now expiring lay,"
7360,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,Flocks every ominous bird of prey;
7361,DESIRE AND POSSESSION 1727,"The raven, vulture, owl, and kite,"

8750,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Array'd in lace, brocades, and tissues."

8755,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Whereof, to make the matter clear,"
8756,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,An inventory follows here.
8757,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"And, first, a dirty smock appear'd,"
8758,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Beneath the arm-pits well besmear'd;
8759,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Strephon, the rogue, display'd it wide,"
8760,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And turn'd it round on ev'ry side:
8761,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"On such a point, few words are best,"
8762,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And Strephon bids us guess the rest;
8763,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"But swears, how damnably the men lie"
8764,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,In calling Celia sweet and cleanly.
8765,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Now listen, while he next produces"
8766,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,The various combs for various uses;
8767,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Fill'd up with dirt so closely fixt,"
8768,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,No brush could force a way betwixt;
8769,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"A paste of composition rare,"
8770,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Sweat, dandriff, powder, lead, and hair:"
8771,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"A fore-head cloth with oil upon't,"
8772,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,To smooth the wrinkles on her front:
8773,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Here alum-flour, to stop the steams"
8774,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Exhaled from sour unsavoury streams:
8775,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"There night-gloves made of Tripsey's hide,"
8776,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,[1]Bequeath'd by Tripsey when she died;
8777,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"With puppy-water, beauty's help,"
8778,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Distil'd from Tripsey's darling whelp.
8779,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Here gallipots and vials placed,"
8780,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Some fill'd with washes, some with paste;"
8781,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Some with pomatums, paints, and slops,"
8782,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And ointments good for scabby chops.
8783,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Hard by a filthy bason stands,"
8784,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Foul'd with the scouring of her hands:

8790,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"When he beheld and smelt the towels,"
8791,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Begumm'd, bematter'd, and beslim'd,"
8792,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"With dirt, and sweat, and ear-wax grim'd;"
8793,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,No object Strephon's eye escapes;
8794,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Here petticoats in frouzy heaps;
8795,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot,"
8796,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,All varnish'd o'er with snuff and snot.
8797,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"The stockings why should I expose,"
8798,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Stain'd with the moisture of her toes,[2]"
8799,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Or greasy coifs, and pinners reeking,"
8800,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Which Celia slept at least a week in?
8801,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"A pair of tweezers next he found,"
8802,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,To pluck her brows in arches round;
8803,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Or hairs that sink the forehead low,"
8804,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Or on her chin like bristles grow.
8805,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,The virtues we must not let pass
8806,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Of Celia's magnifying glass;
8807,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"When frighted Strephon cast his eye on't,"
8808,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,It shew'd the visage of a giant:
8809,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,A glass that can to sight disclose
8810,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"The smallest worm in Celia's nose,"
8811,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And faithfully direct her nail
8812,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,To squeeze it out from head to tail;
8813,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"For, catch it nicely by the head,"
8814,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"It must come out, alive or dead."
8815,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Why, Strephon, will you tell the rest?"
8816,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And must you needs describe the chest?
8817,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,That careless wench! no creature warn her
8818,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,To move it out from yonder corner!
8819,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"But leave it standing full in sight,"
8820,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,For you to exercise your spight?
8821,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"In vain the workman shew'd his wit,"
8822,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"With rings and hinges counterfeit,"
8823,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,To make it seem in this disguise
8824,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,A cabinet to vulgar eyes:
8825,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Which Strephon ventur'd to look in,"
8826,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Resolved to go thro' thick and thin.
8827,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"He lifts the lid: there needs no more,"
8828,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,He smelt it all the time before.
8829,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"As, from within Pandora's box,"
8830,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"When Epimetheus op'd the locks,"
8831,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,A sudden universal crew
8832,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Of human evils upward flew;
8833,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,He still was comforted to find
8834,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,That hope at last remain'd behind:
8835,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"So Strephon, lifting up the lid,"
8836,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"To view what in the chest was hid,"
8837,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,The vapours flew from up the vent;
8838,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"But Strephon, cautious, never meant"
8839,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"The bottom of the pan to grope,"
8840,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And foul his hands in search of hope.
8841,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,O! ne'er may such a vile machine
8842,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Be once in Celia's chamber seen!
8843,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,O! may she better learn to keep
8844,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Those ""secrets of the hoary deep."" [3]"
8845,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"As mutton-cutlets, prime of meat,"
8846,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Which, tho' with art you salt and beat,"
8847,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"As laws of cookery require,"
8848,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And toast them at the clearest fire;
8849,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,If from upon the hopeful chops
8850,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"The fat upon a cinder drops,"
8851,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"To stinking smoke it turns the flame,"
8852,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Pois'ning the flesh from whence it came,"
8853,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"And up exhales a greasy stench,"
8854,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,For which you curse the careless wench:
8855,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"So things which must not be exprest,"
8856,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"When drop'd into the reeking chest,"
8857,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Send up an excremental smell
8858,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,To taint the part from whence they fell:
8859,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"The petticoats and gown perfume,"
8860,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And waft a stink round ev'ry room.
8861,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Thus finishing his grand survey,"
8862,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Disgusted Strephon slunk away;
8863,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Repeating in his amorous fits,"
8864,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"""Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia sh--!"""
8865,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"But Vengeance, goddess never sleeping,"
8866,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Soon punish'd Strephon for his peeping:
8867,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,His foul imagination links
8868,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Each dame he sees with all her stinks;
8869,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"And, if unsavoury odours fly,"
8870,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Conceives a lady standing by.
8871,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"All women his description fits,"
8872,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And both ideas jump like wits;
8873,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"By vicious fancy coupled fast,"
8874,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,And still appearing in contrast.
8875,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"I pity wretched Strephon, blind"
8876,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,To all the charms of woman kind.
8877,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"Should I the Queen of Love refuse,"
8878,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Because she rose from stinking ooze?
8879,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"To him that looks behind the scene,"
8880,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,Statira's but some pocky quean.
8881,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"When Celia in her glory shews,"
8882,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,"If Strephon would but stop his nose,"
8883,THE LADY'S DRESSING-ROOM. 1730,(Who now so impiously blasphemes

9224,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Strephon had long perplex'd his brains,"
9225,STREPHON AND CHLOE,How with so high a nymph he might
9226,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Demean himself the wedding-night:
9227,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"For, as he view'd his person round,"
9228,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Mere mortal flesh was all he found:
9229,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"His hand, his neck, his mouth, and feet,"
9230,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Were duly wash'd, to keep them sweet;"
9231,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"With other parts, that shall be nameless,"
9232,STREPHON AND CHLOE,The ladies else might think me shameless.
9233,STREPHON AND CHLOE,The weather and his love were hot;
9234,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And, should he struggle, I know what--"
9235,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Why, let it go, if I must tell it--"
9236,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"He'll sweat, and then the nymph may smell it;"
9237,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"While she, a goddess dyed in grain,"
9238,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Was unsusceptible of stain,"
9239,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And, Venus-like, her fragrant skin"
9240,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Exhaled ambrosia from within.
9241,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Can such a deity endure
9242,STREPHON AND CHLOE,A mortal human touch impure?
9243,STREPHON AND CHLOE,How did the humbled swain detest
9244,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"His prickly beard, and hairy breast!"
9245,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"His night-cap, border'd round with lace,"
9246,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Could give no softness to his face.
9247,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Yet, if the goddess could be kind,"
9248,STREPHON AND CHLOE,What endless raptures must he find!
9249,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And goddesses have now and then
9250,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Come down to visit mortal men;
9251,STREPHON AND CHLOE,To visit and to court them too:

9253,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"(As in a book he heard it read,)"
9254,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Took Col'nel Peleus[6] to her bed.
9255,STREPHON AND CHLOE,But what if he should lose his life
9256,STREPHON AND CHLOE,By vent'ring on his heavenly wife!
9257,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"(For Strephon could remember well,"
9258,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"That once he heard a school-boy tell,"
9259,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"How Semele,[7] of mortal race,"
9260,STREPHON AND CHLOE,By thunder died in Jove's embrace.)
9261,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And what if daring Strephon dies
9262,STREPHON AND CHLOE,By lightning shot from Chloe's eyes!
9263,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"While these reflections fill'd his head,"
9264,STREPHON AND CHLOE,The bride was put in form to bed:
9265,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"He follow'd, stript, and in he crept,"
9266,STREPHON AND CHLOE,But awfully his distance kept.

9278,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Forbidding his disciples beans.[8]
9279,STREPHON AND CHLOE,O! think what evils must ensue;
9280,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Miss Moll, the jade, will burn it blue;"
9281,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And, when she once has got the art,"
9282,STREPHON AND CHLOE,She cannot help it for her heart;

9286,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Will damp all passion sympathetic;
9287,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And Love such nicety requires,"
9288,STREPHON AND CHLOE,One blast will put out all his fires.
9289,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Since husbands get behind the scene,"
9290,STREPHON AND CHLOE,The wife should study to be clean;
9291,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Nor give the smallest room to guess
9292,STREPHON AND CHLOE,The time when wants of nature press;
9293,STREPHON AND CHLOE,But after marriage practise more
9294,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Decorum than she did before;
9295,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"To keep her spouse deluded still,"
9296,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And make him fancy what she will.
9297,STREPHON AND CHLOE,In bed we left the married pair;
9298,STREPHON AND CHLOE,'Tis time to show how things went there.
9299,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Strephon, who had been often told"
9300,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"That fortune still assists the bold,"
9301,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Resolved to make the first attack;
9302,STREPHON AND CHLOE,But Chloe drove him fiercely back.
9303,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"How could a nymph so chaste as Chloe,"
9304,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"With constitution cold and snowy,"
9305,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Permit a brutish man to touch her?
9306,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Ev'n lambs by instinct fly the butcher.
9307,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Resistance on the wedding-night
9308,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Is what our maidens claim by right;
9309,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And Chloe, 'tis by all agreed,"
9310,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Was maid in thought, in word, and deed."
9311,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Yet some assign a different reason;
9312,STREPHON AND CHLOE,That Strephon chose no proper season.
9313,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Say, fair ones, must I make a pause,"
9314,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Or freely tell the secret cause?
9315,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Twelve cups of tea (with grief I speak)
9316,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Had now constrain'd the nymph to leak.
9317,STREPHON AND CHLOE,This point must needs be settled first:
9318,STREPHON AND CHLOE,The bride must either void or burst.
9319,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Then see the dire effects of pease;
9320,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Think what can give the colic ease.
9321,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"The nymph oppress'd before, behind,"
9322,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"As ships are toss'd by waves and wind,"
9323,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Steals out her hand, by nature led,"
9324,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And brings a vessel into bed;
9325,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Fair utensil, as smooth and white"
9326,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"As Chloe's skin, almost as bright."
9327,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Strephon, who heard the fuming rill"
9328,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"As from a mossy cliff distil,"
9329,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Cried out, Ye Gods! what sound is this?"
9330,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Can Chloe, heavenly Chloe,----?"
9331,STREPHON AND CHLOE,But when he smelt a noisome steam
9332,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Which oft attends that lukewarm stream;
9333,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"(Salerno both together joins,[10]"
9334,STREPHON AND CHLOE,As sov'reign med'cines for the loins:)
9335,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And though contriv'd, we may suppose,"
9336,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"To slip his ears, yet struck his nose;"
9337,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"He found her while the scent increast,"
9338,STREPHON AND CHLOE,As mortal as himself at least.
9339,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"But soon, with like occasions prest"
9340,STREPHON AND CHLOE,He boldly sent his hand in quest
9341,STREPHON AND CHLOE,(Inspired with courage from his bride)
9342,STREPHON AND CHLOE,To reach the pot on t'other side;
9343,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And, as he fill'd the reeking vase;"
9344,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Let fly a rouser in her face.
9345,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"The little Cupids hov'ring round,"
9346,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"(As pictures prove) with garlands crown'd,"
9347,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Abash'd at what they saw and heard,"
9348,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Flew off, nor ever more appear'd."
9349,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Adieu to ravishing delights,"
9350,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"High raptures, and romantic flights;"
9351,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"To goddesses so heav'nly sweet,"
9352,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Expiring shepherds at their feet;
9353,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"To silver meads and shady bowers,"
9354,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Dress'd up with amaranthine flowers.
9355,STREPHON AND CHLOE,How great a change! how quickly made!
9356,STREPHON AND CHLOE,They learn to call a spade a spade.
9357,STREPHON AND CHLOE,They soon from all constraint are freed;
9358,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Can see each other do their need.
9359,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"On box of cedar sits the wife,"
9360,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And makes it warm for dearest life;
9361,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And, by the beastly way of thinking,"
9362,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Find great society in stinking.
9363,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Now Strephon daily entertains
9364,STREPHON AND CHLOE,His Chloe in the homeliest strains;
9365,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And Chloe, more experienc'd grown,"
9366,STREPHON AND CHLOE,With int'rest pays him back his own.
9367,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"No maid at court is less asham'd,"
9368,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Howe'er for selling bargains fam'd,"
9369,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Than she to name her parts behind,"
9370,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Or when a-bed to let out wind.
9371,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Fair Decency, celestial maid!"
9372,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Descend from Heaven to Beauty's aid!
9373,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Though Beauty may beget desire,"
9374,STREPHON AND CHLOE,'Tis thou must fan the Lover's fire;
9375,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"For Beauty, like supreme dominion,"
9376,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Is best supported by Opinion:
9377,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"If Decency bring no supplies,"
9378,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Opinion falls, and Beauty dies."
9379,STREPHON AND CHLOE,To see some radiant nymph appear
9380,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"In all her glitt'ring birth-day gear,"
9381,STREPHON AND CHLOE,You think some goddess from the sky
9382,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Descended, ready cut and dry:"
9383,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"But ere you sell yourself to laughter,"
9384,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Consider well what may come after;
9385,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"For fine ideas vanish fast,"
9386,STREPHON AND CHLOE,While all the gross and filthy last.
9387,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"O Strephon, ere that fatal day"
9388,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"When Chloe stole your heart away,"
9389,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Had you but through a cranny spy'd
9390,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"On house of ease your future bride,"
9391,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"In all the postures of her face,"
9392,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Which nature gives in such a case;
9393,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Distortions, groanings, strainings, heavings,"
9394,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"'Twere better you had lick'd her leavings,"
9395,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Than from experience find too late
9396,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Your goddess grown a filthy mate.
9397,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Your fancy then had always dwelt
9398,STREPHON AND CHLOE,On what you saw and what you smelt;
9399,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Would still the same ideas give ye,"
9400,STREPHON AND CHLOE,As when you spy'd her on the privy;
9401,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And, spite of Chloe's charms divine,"
9402,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Your heart had been as whole as mine.
9403,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Authorities, both old and recent,"
9404,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Direct that women must be decent;
9405,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And from the spouse each blemish hide,"
9406,STREPHON AND CHLOE,More than from all the world beside.
9407,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Unjustly all our nymphs complain
9408,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Their empire holds so short a reign;
9409,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Is, after marriage, lost so soon,"
9410,STREPHON AND CHLOE,It hardly lasts the honey-moon:
9411,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"For, if they keep not what they caught,"
9412,STREPHON AND CHLOE,It is entirely their own fault.
9413,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"They take possession of the crown,"
9414,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And then throw all their weapons down:
9415,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Though, by the politician's scheme,"
9416,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Whoe'er arrives at power supreme,"
9417,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Those arts, by which at first they gain it,"
9418,STREPHON AND CHLOE,They still must practise to maintain it.
9419,STREPHON AND CHLOE,What various ways our females take
9420,STREPHON AND CHLOE,To pass for wits before a rake!
9421,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And in the fruitless search pursue
9422,STREPHON AND CHLOE,All other methods but the true!
9423,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Some try to learn polite behaviour
9424,STREPHON AND CHLOE,By reading books against their Saviour;
9425,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Some call it witty to reflect
9426,STREPHON AND CHLOE,On ev'ry natural defect;
9427,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Some shew they never want explaining
9428,STREPHON AND CHLOE,To comprehend a double meaning.
9429,STREPHON AND CHLOE,But sure a tell-tale out of school
9430,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Is of all wits the greatest fool;
9431,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Whose rank imagination fills
9432,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Her heart, and from her lips distils;"
9433,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"You'd think she utter'd from behind,"
9434,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Or at her mouth was breaking wind.
9435,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Why is a handsome wife ador'd
9436,STREPHON AND CHLOE,By every coxcomb but her lord?
9437,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"From yonder puppet-man inquire,"
9438,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Who wisely hides his wood and wire;
9439,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Shows Sheba's queen completely drest,"
9440,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And Solomon in royal vest:
9441,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"But view them litter'd on the floor,"
9442,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Or strung on pegs behind the door;
9443,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Punch is exactly of a piece
9444,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"With Lorrain's duke, and prince of Greece."
9445,STREPHON AND CHLOE,A prudent builder should forecast
9446,STREPHON AND CHLOE,How long the stuff is like to last;
9447,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"And carefully observe the ground,"
9448,STREPHON AND CHLOE,To build on some foundation sound.
9449,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"What house, when its materials crumble,"
9450,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Must not inevitably tumble?
9451,STREPHON AND CHLOE,What edifice can long endure
9452,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Raised on a basis unsecure?
9453,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Rash mortals, ere you take a wife,"
9454,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Contrive your pile to last for life:
9455,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Since beauty scarce endures a day,"
9456,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And youth so swiftly glides away;
9457,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Why will you make yourself a bubble,"
9458,STREPHON AND CHLOE,To build on sand with hay and stubble?
9459,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"On sense and wit your passion found,"
9460,STREPHON AND CHLOE,By decency cemented round;
9461,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Let prudence with good-nature strive,"
9462,STREPHON AND CHLOE,To keep esteem and love alive.
9463,STREPHON AND CHLOE,"Then come old age whene'er it will,"
9464,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Your friendship shall continue still:
9465,STREPHON AND CHLOE,And thus a mutual gentle fire
9466,STREPHON AND CHLOE,Shall never but with life expire.

9655,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"How could you, Gay, disgrace the Muse's train,"
9656,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],To serve a tasteless court twelve years in vain![2]
9657,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Fain would I think our female friend [3] sincere,"
9658,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Till Bob,[4] the poet's foe, possess'd her ear."
9659,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Did female virtue e'er so high ascend,"
9660,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],To lose an inch of favour for a friend?
9661,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Say, had the court no better place to choose"
9662,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"For triee, than make a dry-nurse of thy Muse?"
9663,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"How cheaply had thy liberty been sold,"
9664,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],To squire a royal girl of two years old:
9665,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"In leading strings her infant steps to guide,"
9666,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Or with her go-cart amble side by side![5]
9667,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"But princely Douglas,[6] and his glorious dame,"
9668,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Advanced thy fortune, and preserved thy fame."
9669,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Nor will your nobler gifts be misapplied,"
9670,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],When o'er your patron's treasure you preside:
9671,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"The world shall own, his choice was wise and just,"
9672,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],For sons of Phoebus never break their trust.
9673,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Not love of beauty less the heart inflames
9674,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Of guardian eunuchs to the sultan's dames,"
9675,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Their passions not more impotent and cold,"
9676,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Than those of poets to the lust of gold.
9677,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"With Pæan's purest fire his favourites glow,"
9678,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],The dregs will serve to ripen ore below:
9679,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"His meanest work: for, had he thought it fit"
9680,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"That wealth should be the appanage of wit,"
9681,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],The god of light could ne'er have been so blind
9682,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],To deal it to the worst of human kind.
9683,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"But let me now, for I can do it well,"
9684,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Your conduct in this new employ foretell.
9685,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And first: to make my observation right,"
9686,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"I place a statesman full before my sight,"
9687,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"A bloated minister in all his gear,"
9688,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],With shameless visage and perfidious leer:
9689,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Two rows of teeth arm each devouring jaw,"
9690,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],And ostrich-like his all-digesting maw.
9691,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"My fancy drags this monster to my view,"
9692,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],To shew the world his chief reverse in you.
9693,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Of loud unmeaning sounds, a rapid flood"
9694,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Rolls from his mouth in plenteous streams of mud;
9695,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"With these the court and senate-house he plies,"
9696,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Made up of noise, and impudence, and lies."
9697,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Now let me show how Bob and you agree:
9698,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"You serve a potent prince,[7] as well as he."
9699,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"The ducal coffers trusted to your charge,"
9700,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Your honest care may fill, perhaps enlarge:"
9701,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"His vassals easy, and the owner blest;"
9702,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"They pay a trifle, and enjoy the rest."
9703,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Not so a nation's revenues are paid;
9704,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],The servant's faults are on the master laid.
9705,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"The people with a sigh their taxes bring,"
9706,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And, cursing Bob, forget to bless the king."
9707,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Next hearken, Gay, to what thy charge requires,"
9708,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"With servants, tenants, and the neighbouring squires,"
9709,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Let all domestics feel your gentle sway;
9710,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Nor bribe, insult, nor flatter, nor betray."
9711,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Let due reward to merit be allow'd;
9712,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Nor with your kindred half the palace crowd;
9713,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Nor think yourself secure in doing wrong,"
9714,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],By telling noses [8] with a party strong.
9715,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Be rich; but of your wealth make no parade;
9716,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"At least, before your master's debts are paid;"
9717,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Nor in a palace, built with charge immense,"
9718,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Presume to treat him at his own expense.[9]
9719,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Each farmer in the neighbourhood can count
9720,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],To what your lawful perquisites amount.
9721,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"The tenants poor, the hardness of the times,"
9722,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Are ill excuses for a servant's crimes.
9723,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"With interest, and a premium paid beside,"
9724,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],The master's pressing wants must be supplied;
9725,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],With hasty zeal behold the steward come
9726,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],By his own credit to advance the sum;
9727,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Who, while th'unrighteous Mammon is his friend,"
9728,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],May well conclude his power will never end.
9729,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],A faithful treasurer! what could he do more?
9730,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],He lends my lord what was my lord's before.
9731,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"The law so strictly guards the monarch's health,"
9732,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],That no physician dares prescribe by stealth:
9733,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],The council sit; approve the doctor's skill;
9734,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],And give advice before he gives the pill.
9735,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],But the state empiric acts a safer part;
9736,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And, while he poisons, wins the royal heart."
9737,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],But how can I describe the ravenous breed?
9738,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Then let me now by negatives proceed.
9739,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Suppose your lord a trusty servant send
9740,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],On weighty business to some neighbouring friend:
9741,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Presume not, Gay, unless you serve a drone,"
9742,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],To countermand his orders by your own.
9743,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Should some imperious neighbour sink the boats,"
9744,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And drain the fish-ponds, while your master dotes;"
9745,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Shall he upon the ducal rights intrench,"
9746,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Because he bribed you with a brace of tench?
9747,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Nor from your lord his bad condition hide,"
9748,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"To feed his luxury, or soothe his pride."
9749,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Nor at an under rate his timber sell,"
9750,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And with an oath assure him, all is well;"
9751,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Or swear it rotten, and with humble airs [10]"
9752,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Request it of him, to complete your stairs;"
9753,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Nor, when a mortgage lies on half his lands,"
9754,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Come with a purse of guineas in your hands.
9755,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Have Peter Waters [11] always in your mind;
9756,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"That rogue, of genuine ministerial kind,"
9757,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Can half the peerage by his arts bewitch,"
9758,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Starve twenty lords to make one scoundrel rich:
9759,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And, when he gravely has undone a score,"
9760,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Is humbly pray'd to ruin twenty more.
9761,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"A dext'rous steward, when his tricks are found,"
9762,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Hush-money sends to all the neighbours round;
9763,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"His master, unsuspicious of his pranks,"
9764,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Pays all the cost, and gives the villain thanks."
9765,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And, should a friend attempt to set him right,"
9766,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],His lordship would impute it all to spite;
9767,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Would love his favourite better than before,"
9768,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],And trust his honesty just so much more.
9769,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Thus families, like realms, with equal fate,"
9770,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Are sunk by premier ministers of state.
9771,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Some, when an heir succeeds, go bodily on,"
9772,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And, as they robb'd the father, rob the son."
9773,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"A knave, who deep embroils his lord's affairs,"
9774,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Will soon grow necessary to his heirs.
9775,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"His policy consists in setting traps,"
9776,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"In finding ways and means, and stopping gaps;"
9777,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"He knows a thousand tricks whene'er he please,"
9778,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Though not to cure, yet palliate each disease."
9779,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"In either case, an equal chance is run;"
9780,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"For, keep or turn him out, my lord's undone."
9781,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],You want a hand to clear a filthy sink;
9782,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],No cleanly workman can endure the stink.
9783,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],A strong dilemma in a desperate case!
9784,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"To act with infamy, or quit the place."
9785,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"A bungler thus, who scarce the nail can hit,"
9786,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],With driving wrong will make the panel split:
9787,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Nor dares an abler workman undertake
9788,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"To drive a second, lest the whole should break."
9789,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],In every court the parallel will hold;
9790,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And kings, like private folks, are bought and sold."
9791,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"The ruling rogue, who dreads to be cashler'd,"
9792,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Contrives, as he is hated, to be fear'd;"
9793,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Confounds accounts, perplexes all affairs:"
9794,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"For vengeance more embroils, than skill repairs."
9795,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"So robbers, (and their ends are just the same,)"
9796,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"To 'scape inquiries, leave the house in flame."
9797,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"I knew a brazen minister of state,[12]"
9798,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Who bore for twice ten years the public hate.
9799,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],In every mouth the question most in vogue
9800,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Was, when will they turn out this odious rogue?"
9801,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],A juncture happen'd in his highest pride:
9802,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"While he went robbing on, his master died.[13]"
9803,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],We thought there now remain'd no room to doubt;
9804,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"The work is done, the minister must out."
9805,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],The court invited more than one or two:
9806,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Will you, Sir Spencer?[14] or will you, or you?"
9807,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],But not a soul his office durst accept;
9808,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],The subtle knave had all the plunder swept:
9809,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"And, such was then the temper of the times,"
9810,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],He owed his preservation to his crimes.
9811,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],The candidates observed his dirty paws;
9812,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],Nor found it difficult to guess the cause:
9813,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"But, when they smelt such foul corruptions round him,"
9814,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Away they fled, and left him as they found him."
9815,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"Thus, when a greedy sloven once has thrown"
9816,AN EPISTLE TO MR. GAY[1],"His snot into the mess, 'tis all his own."

9890,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Every error I could find
9891,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Through the mazes of your mind,"
9892,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Have my busy Muse employ'd,"
9893,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Till the company was cloy'd.
9894,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Are you positive and fretful,"
9895,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Heedless, ignorant, forgetful?"
9896,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Those, and twenty follies more,"
9897,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I have often told before.
9898,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Hearken what my lady says:
9899,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Have I nothing then to praise?
9900,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Ill it fits you to be witty,"
9901,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Where a fault should move your pity.
9902,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"If you think me too conceited,"
9903,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Or to passion quickly heated;
9904,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,If my wandering head be less
9905,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Set on reading than on dress;
9906,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,If I always seem too dull t'ye;
9907,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I can solve the diffi--culty.
9908,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,You would teach me to be wise:
9909,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Truth and honour how to prize;
9910,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"How to shine in conversation,"
9911,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,And with credit fill my station;
9912,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,How to relish notions high;
9913,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"How to live, and how to die."
9914,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,But it was decreed by Fate--
9915,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Mr. Dean, you come too late."
9916,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Well I know, you can discern,"
9917,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I am now too old to learn:
9918,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Follies, from my youth instill'd,"
9919,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Have my soul entirely fill'd;
9920,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"In my head and heart they centre,"
9921,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Nor will let your lessons enter.
9922,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Bred a fondling and an heiress;
9923,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Drest like any lady mayoress:
9924,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Cocker'd by the servants round,"
9925,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Was too good to touch the ground;
9926,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Thought the life of every lady
9927,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Should be one continued play-day--
9928,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Balls, and masquerades, and shows,"
9929,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Visits, plays, and powder'd beaux."
9930,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Thus you have my case at large,"
9931,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,And may now perform your charge.
9932,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Those materials I have furnish'd,"
9933,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"When by you refined and burnish'd,"
9934,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Must, that all the world may know 'em,"
9935,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Be reduced into a poem.
9936,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"But, I beg, suspend a while"
9937,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"That same paltry, burlesque style;"
9938,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Drop for once your constant rule,"
9939,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Turning all to ridicule;
9940,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Teaching others how to ape you;
9941,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Court nor parliament can 'scape you;
9942,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Treat the public and your friends
9943,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Both alike, while neither mends."
9944,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Sing my praise in strain sublime:
9945,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Treat me not with dogg'rel rhyme.
9946,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"'Tis but just, you should produce,"
9947,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"With each fault, each fault's excuse;"
9948,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Not to publish every trifle,"
9949,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,And my few perfections stifle.
9950,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"With some gifts at least endow me,"
9951,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Which my very foes allow me.
9952,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Am I spiteful, proud, unjust?"
9953,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Did I ever break my trust?
9954,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Which of all our modern dames
9955,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Censures less, or less defames?"
9956,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,In good manners am I faulty?
9957,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Can you call me rude or haughty?
9958,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Did I e'er my mite withhold
9959,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,From the impotent and old?
9960,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,When did ever I omit
9961,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Due regard for men of wit?
9962,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,When have I esteem express'd
9963,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,For a coxcomb gaily dress'd?
9964,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Do I, like the female tribe,"
9965,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Think it wit to fleer and gibe?
9966,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Who with less designing ends
9967,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Kindlier entertains her friends;
9968,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"With good words and countenance sprightly,"
9969,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Strives to treat them more politely?
9970,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Think not cards my chief diversion:
9971,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"'Tis a wrong, unjust aspersion:"
9972,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Never knew I any good in 'em,"
9973,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,But to dose my head like laudanum.
9974,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"We, by play, as men, by drinking,"
9975,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Pass our nights to drive out thinking.
9976,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"From my ailments give me leisure,"
9977,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I shall read and think with pleasure;
9978,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Conversation learn to relish,"
9979,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,And with books my mind embellish.
9980,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Now, methinks, I hear you cry,"
9981,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Mr. Dean, you must reply."
9982,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Madam, I allow 'tis true:"
9983,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,All these praises are your due.
9984,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"You, like some acute philosopher,"
9985,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Every fault have drawn a gloss over;[1]
9986,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Placing in the strongest light
9987,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,All your virtues to my sight.
9988,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Though you lead a blameless life,"
9989,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Are an humble prudent wife,"
9990,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Answer all domestic ends:
9991,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,What is this to us your friends?
9992,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Though your children by a nod
9993,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Stand in awe without a rod;
9994,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Though, by your obliging sway,"
9995,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Servants love you, and obey;"
9996,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Though you treat us with a smile;
9997,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Clear your looks, and smooth your style;"
9998,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Load our plates from every dish;
9999,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,This is not the thing we wish.
10000,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Colonel ***** may be your debtor;
10001,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,We expect employment better.
10002,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"You must learn, if you would gain us,"
10003,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,With good sense to entertain us.
10004,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Scholars, when good sense describing,"
10005,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Call it tasting and imbibing;
10006,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Metaphoric meat and drink
10007,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Is to understand and think;
10008,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,We may carve for others thus;
10009,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,And let others carve for us;
10010,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"To discourse, and to attend,"
10011,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Is, to help yourself and friend."
10012,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Conversation is but carving;
10013,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Carve for all, yourself is starving:"
10014,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Give no more to every guest,"
10015,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Than he's able to digest;
10016,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Give him always of the prime;
10017,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,And but little at a time.
10018,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Carve to all but just enough:
10019,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Let them neither starve nor stuff:
10020,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"And, that you may have your due,"
10021,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Let your neighbours carve for you.
10022,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"This comparison will hold,"
10023,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Could it well in rhyme be told,"
10024,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"How conversing, listening, thinking,"
10025,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Justly may resemble drinking;
10026,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"For a friend a glass you fill,"
10027,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,What is this but to instil?
10028,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,To conclude this long essay;
10029,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Pardon if I disobey,"
10030,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Nor against my natural vein,"
10031,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Treat you in heroic strain.
10032,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"I, as all the parish knows,"
10033,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Hardly can be grave in prose:
10034,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Still to lash, and lashing smile,"
10035,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Ill befits a lofty style.
10036,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,From the planet of my birth
10037,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I encounter vice with mirth.
10038,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Wicked ministers of state
10039,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I can easier scorn than hate;
10040,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,And I find it answers right:
10041,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Scorn torments them more than spight.
10042,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,All the vices of a court
10043,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Do but serve to make me sport.
10044,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Were I in some foreign realm,"
10045,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Which all vices overwhelm;
10046,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Should a monkey wear a crown,"
10047,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Must I tremble at his frown?
10048,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Could I not, through all his ermine,"
10049,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,'Spy the strutting chattering vermin;
10050,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Safely write a smart lampoon,"
10051,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,To expose the brisk baboon?
10052,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,When my Muse officious ventures
10053,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,On the nation's representers:
10054,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Teaching by what golden rules
10055,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Into knaves they turn their fools;
10056,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"How the helm is ruled by Walpole,"
10057,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"At whose oars, like slaves, they all pull;"
10058,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Let the vessel split on shelves;
10059,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,With the freight enrich themselves:
10060,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Safe within my little wherry,"
10061,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,All their madness makes me merry:
10062,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Like the waterman of Thames,"
10063,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"I row by, and call them names;"
10064,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Like the ever-laughing sage,[2]"
10065,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,In a jest I spend my rage:
10066,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"(Though it must be understood,"
10067,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I would hang them if I could;)
10068,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"If I can but fill my niche,"
10069,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I attempt no higher pitch;
10070,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Leave to d'Anvers and his mate
10071,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Maxims wise to rule the state.
10072,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Pulteney deep, accomplish'd St. Johns,"
10073,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Scourge the villains with a vengeance;
10074,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Let me, though the smell be noisome,"
10075,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Strip their bums; let Caleb[3] hoise 'em;
10076,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Then apply Alecto's[4] whip
10077,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Till they wriggle, howl, and skip."
10078,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Deuce is in you, Mr. Dean:"
10079,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,What can all this passion mean?
10080,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Mention courts! you'll ne'er be quiet
10081,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,On corruptions running riot.
10082,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,End as it befits your station;
10083,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Come to use and application;
10084,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Nor with senates keep a fuss.
10085,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I submit; and answer thus:
10086,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"If the machinations brewing,"
10087,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"To complete the public ruin,"
10088,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Never once could have the power
10089,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,To affect me half an hour;
10090,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Sooner would I write in buskins,"
10091,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Mournful elegies on Blueskins.[5]
10092,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,If I laugh at Whig and Tory;
10093,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"I conclude _à fortiori_,"
10094,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,All your eloquence will scarce
10095,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Drive me from my favourite farce.
10096,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"This I must insist on; for, as"
10097,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"It is well observed by Horace,[6]"
10098,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Ridicule has greater power
10099,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,To reform the world than sour.
10100,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Horses thus, let jockeys judge else,"
10101,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Switches better guide than cudgels.
10102,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Bastings heavy, dry, obtuse,"
10103,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Only dulness can produce;
10104,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,While a little gentle jerking
10105,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Sets the spirits all a-working.
10106,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Thus, I find it by experiment,"
10107,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Scolding moves you less than merriment.
10108,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I may storm and rage in vain;
10109,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,It but stupifies your brain.
10110,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"But with raillery to nettle,"
10111,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Sets your thoughts upon their mettle;
10112,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Gives imagination scope;
10113,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Never lets your mind elope;
10114,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Drives out brangling and contention.
10115,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Brings in reason and invention.
10116,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"For your sake as well as mine,"
10117,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I the lofty style decline.
10118,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"I should make a figure scurvy,"
10119,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,And your head turn topsy-turvy.
10120,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,I who love to have a fling
10121,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Both at senate-house and king:
10122,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"That they might some better way tread,"
10123,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,To avoid the public hatred;
10124,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Thought no method more commodious,"
10125,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Than to show their vices odious;
10126,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Which I chose to make appear,"
10127,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Not by anger, but by sneer."
10128,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"As my method of reforming,"
10129,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Is by laughing, not by storming,"
10130,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,(For my friends have always thought
10131,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Tenderness my greatest fault,)"
10132,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Would you have me change my style?
10133,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,On your faults no longer smile;
10134,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"But, to patch up all our quarrels,"
10135,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Quote you texts from Plutarch's Morals,"
10136,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Or from Solomon produce
10137,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Maxims teaching Wisdom's use?
10138,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"If I treat you like a crown'd head,"
10139,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,You have cheap enough compounded;
10140,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Can you put in higher claims,"
10141,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Than the owners of St. James?
10142,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"You are not so great a grievance,"
10143,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,As the hirelings of St. Stephen's.
10144,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,You are of a lower class
10145,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Than my friend Sir Robert Brass.
10146,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,None of these have mercy found:
10147,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"I have laugh'd, and lash'd them round."
10148,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Have you seen a rocket fly?
10149,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,You would swear it pierced the sky:
10150,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"It but reach'd the middle air,"
10151,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Bursting into pieces there;
10152,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Thousand sparkles falling down
10153,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Light on many a coxcomb's crown.
10154,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,See what mirth the sport creates!
10155,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Singes hair, but breaks no pates."
10156,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Thus, should I attempt to climb,"
10157,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Treat you in a style sublime,"
10158,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Such a rocket is my Muse:
10159,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Should I lofty numbers choose,"
10160,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Ere I reach'd Parnassus' top,"
10161,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"I should burst, and bursting drop;"
10162,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"All my fire would fall in scraps,"
10163,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Give your head some gentle raps;
10164,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Only make it smart a while;
10165,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"Then could I forbear to smile,"
10166,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,When I found the tingling pain
10167,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Entering warm your frigid brain;
10168,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Make you able upon sight
10169,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,To decide of wrong and right;
10170,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Talk with sense whate'er you please on;
10171,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Learn to relish truth and reason!
10172,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,Thus we both shall gain our prize;
10173,IN THE HEROIC STYLE,"I to laugh, and you grow wise."

10425,PREFACE,"greater mistake, or of worse consequences through the commerce of"
10426,PREFACE,"mankind, than the wrong judgments they are apt to entertain of their"
10427,PREFACE,"own talents. I knew a stuttering alderman in London, a great frequenter"
10428,PREFACE,"of coffeehouses, who, when a fresh newspaper was brought in, constantly"
10429,PREFACE,"seized it first, and read it aloud to his brother citizens; but in a"
10430,PREFACE,manner as little intelligible to the standers-by as to himself. How many
10431,PREFACE,"pretenders to learning expose themselves, by choosing to discourse on"
10432,PREFACE,those very parts of science wherewith they are least acquainted! It is
10433,PREFACE,the same case in every other qualification. By the multitude of those
10434,PREFACE,"who deal in rhymes, from half a sheet to twenty, which come out every"
10435,PREFACE,"minute, there must be at least five hundred poets in the city and suburbs"
10436,PREFACE,"of London: half as many coffeehouse orators, exclusive of the clergy,"
10437,PREFACE,"forty thousand politicians, and four thousand five hundred profound"
10438,PREFACE,"scholars; not to mention the wits, the railers, the smart fellows, and"
10439,PREFACE,critics; all as illiterate and impudent as a suburb whore. What are we
10440,PREFACE,"to think of the fine-dressed sparks, proud of their own personal"
10441,PREFACE,"deformities, which appear the more hideous by the contrast of wearing"
10442,PREFACE,"scarlet and gold, with what they call toupees[1] on their heads, and all"
10443,PREFACE,"the frippery of a modern beau, to make a figure before women; some of"
10444,PREFACE,"them with hump-backs, others hardly five feet high, and every feature"
10445,PREFACE,of their faces distorted: I have seen many of these insipid pretenders
10446,PREFACE,"entering into conversation with persons of learning, constantly making"
10447,PREFACE,"the grossest blunders in every sentence, without conveying one single"
10448,PREFACE,idea fit for a rational creature to spend a thought on; perpetually
10449,PREFACE,"confounding all chronology, and geography, even of present times. I"
10450,PREFACE,"compute, that London hath eleven native fools of the beau and puppy kind,"
10451,PREFACE,for one among us in Dublin; besides two-thirds of ours transplanted
10452,PREFACE,"thither, who are now naturalized: whereby that overgrown capital exceeds"
10453,PREFACE,ours in the articles of dunces by forty to one; and what is more to our
10454,PREFACE,"farther mortification, there is no one distinguished fool of Irish birth"
10455,PREFACE,"or education, who makes any noise in that famous metropolis, unless the"
10456,PREFACE,London prints be very partial or defective; whereas London is seldom
10457,PREFACE,"without a dozen of their own educating, who engross the vogue for half a"
10458,PREFACE,"winter together, and are never heard of more, but give place to a new"
10459,PREFACE,"set. This has been the constant progress for at least thirty years past,"
10460,PREFACE,only allowing for the change of breed and fashion.
10461,PREFACE,
10462,PREFACE,The poem is grounded upon the universal folly in mankind of mistaking
10463,PREFACE,their talents; by which the author does a great honour to his
10464,PREFACE,"own species, almost equalling them with certain brutes; wherein, indeed,"
10465,PREFACE,"he is too partial, as he freely confesses: and yet he has gone as"
10466,PREFACE,"low as he well could, by specifying four animals; the wolf, the ass, the"
10467,PREFACE,"swine, and the ape; all equally mischievous, except the last, who outdoes"
10468,PREFACE,them in the article of cunning: so great is the pride of man!

10470,PREFACE,"When beasts could speak, (the learned say"
10471,PREFACE,"They still can do so every day,)"

10476,PREFACE,"The king of brutes (to make it plain,"

10478,PREFACE,"By proclamation gave command,"
10479,PREFACE,That every subject in the land
10480,PREFACE,Should to the priest confess their sins;
10481,PREFACE,And thus the pious Wolf begins:
10482,PREFACE,"Good father, I must own with shame,"
10483,PREFACE,That often I have been to blame:
10484,PREFACE,"I must confess, on Friday last,"
10485,PREFACE,Wretch that I was! I broke my fast:
10486,PREFACE,But I defy the basest tongue
10487,PREFACE,To prove I did my neighbour wrong;
10488,PREFACE,"Or ever went to seek my food,"
10489,PREFACE,"By rapine, theft, or thirst of blood."
10490,PREFACE,"The Ass approaching next, confess'd,"
10491,PREFACE,That in his heart he loved a jest:
10492,PREFACE,"A wag he was, he needs must own,"
10493,PREFACE,And could not let a dunce alone:
10494,PREFACE,"Sometimes his friend he would not spare,"
10495,PREFACE,And might perhaps be too severe:
10496,PREFACE,"But yet the worst that could be said,"
10497,PREFACE,He was a wit both born and bred;
10498,PREFACE,"And, if it be a sin and shame,"
10499,PREFACE,Nature alone must bear the blame:
10500,PREFACE,"One fault he has, is sorry for't,"
10501,PREFACE,His ears are half a foot too short;
10502,PREFACE,"Which could he to the standard bring,"
10503,PREFACE,He'd show his face before the king:
10504,PREFACE,"Then for his voice, there's none disputes"
10505,PREFACE,That he's the nightingale of brutes.
10506,PREFACE,"The Swine with contrite heart allow'd,"
10507,PREFACE,His shape and beauty made him proud:
10508,PREFACE,"In diet was perhaps too nice,"
10509,PREFACE,But gluttony was ne'er his vice:
10510,PREFACE,"In every turn of life content,"
10511,PREFACE,And meekly took what fortune sent:
10512,PREFACE,"Inquire through all the parish round,"
10513,PREFACE,A better neighbour ne'er was found;
10514,PREFACE,His vigilance might some displease;
10515,PREFACE,"'Tis true, he hated sloth like pease."
10516,PREFACE,"The mimic Ape began his chatter,"
10517,PREFACE,How evil tongues his life bespatter;
10518,PREFACE,"Much of the censuring world complain'd,"
10519,PREFACE,"Who said, his gravity was feign'd:"
10520,PREFACE,"Indeed, the strictness of his morals"
10521,PREFACE,Engaged him in a hundred quarrels:
10522,PREFACE,"He saw, and he was grieved to see't,"
10523,PREFACE,His zeal was sometimes indiscreet:
10524,PREFACE,He found his virtues too severe
10525,PREFACE,For our corrupted times to bear;
10526,PREFACE,Yet such a lewd licentious age
10527,PREFACE,Might well excuse a stoic's rage.
10528,PREFACE,"The Goat advanced with decent pace,"
10529,PREFACE,And first excused his youthful face;
10530,PREFACE,Forgiveness begg'd that he appear'd
10531,PREFACE,('Twas Nature's fault) without a beard.
10532,PREFACE,"'Tis true, he was not much inclined"
10533,PREFACE,To fondness for the female kind:
10534,PREFACE,"Not, as his enemies object,"
10535,PREFACE,"From chance, or natural defect;"
10536,PREFACE,Not by his frigid constitution;
10537,PREFACE,But through a pious resolution:

10548,PREFACE,The Lawyer swears (you may rely on't)
10549,PREFACE,He never squeezed a needy client;
10550,PREFACE,"And this he makes his constant rule,"
10551,PREFACE,For which his brethren call him fool;
10552,PREFACE,"His conscience always was so nice,"
10553,PREFACE,He freely gave the poor advice;

10555,PREFACE,A hundred fees last Easter term;

10565,PREFACE,"He fail'd, because he could not flatter;"
10566,PREFACE,"He had not learn'd to turn his coat,"
10567,PREFACE,Nor for a party give his vote:
10568,PREFACE,His crime he quickly understood;
10569,PREFACE,Too zealous for the nation's good:
10570,PREFACE,"He found the ministers resent it,"
10571,PREFACE,Yet could not for his heart repent it.
10572,PREFACE,"The Chaplain vows, he cannot fawn,"
10573,PREFACE,Though it would raise him to the lawn:
10574,PREFACE,He pass'd his hours among his books;

10576,PREFACE,"He might, if he were worldly wise,"
10577,PREFACE,"Preferment get, and spare his eyes;"
10578,PREFACE,But owns he had a stubborn spirit.
10579,PREFACE,That made him trust alone to merit;

10587,PREFACE,He quite forgot to say his prayers.
10588,PREFACE,"He cannot help it, for his heart,"
10589,PREFACE,Sometimes to act the parson's part:
10590,PREFACE,"Quotes from the Bible many a sentence,"
10591,PREFACE,That moves his patients to repentance;
10592,PREFACE,"And, when his medicines do no good,"
10593,PREFACE,Supports their minds with heavenly food:
10594,PREFACE,"At which, however well intended,"
10595,PREFACE,He hears the clergy are offended;
10596,PREFACE,"And grown so bold behind his back,"
10597,PREFACE,To call him hypocrite and quack.
10598,PREFACE,In his own church he keeps a seat;
10599,PREFACE,Says grace before and after meat;
10600,PREFACE,"And calls, without affecting airs,"
10601,PREFACE,His household twice a-day to prayers.
10602,PREFACE,"He shuns apothecaries' shops,"

10605,PREFACE,Nor bribes my lady's favourite maid.
10606,PREFACE,"Old nurse-keepers would never hire,"
10607,PREFACE,To recommend him to the squire;

10610,PREFACE,"The Statesman tells you, with a sneer,"
10611,PREFACE,His fault is to be too sincere;
10612,PREFACE,"And having no sinister ends,"
10613,PREFACE,Is apt to disoblige his friends.

10623,PREFACE,"To serve the king, and please the nation."
10624,PREFACE,Though hard to find in every case
10625,PREFACE,The fittest man to fill a place:

10643,PREFACE,He's poorer by ten thousand pound.
10644,PREFACE,"He owns, and hopes it is no sin,"
10645,PREFACE,He ne'er was partial to his kin;
10646,PREFACE,"He thought it base for men in stations,"
10647,PREFACE,To crowd the court with their relations:
10648,PREFACE,"His country was his dearest mother,"

11956,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Pronounces you a stupid rogue,"
11957,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Damns all your thoughts as low and little,"
11958,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Sit still, and swallow down your spittle;"
11959,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Be silent as a politician,"
11960,A RHAPSODY. 1733,For talking may beget suspicion;
11961,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Or praise the judgment of the town,"
11962,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And help yourself to run it down.
11963,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Give up your fond paternal pride,"
11964,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Nor argue on the weaker side:
11965,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"For, poems read without a name"
11966,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"We justly praise, or justly blame;"
11967,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And critics have no partial views,"
11968,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Except they know whom they abuse:
11969,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And since you ne'er provoke their spite,"
11970,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Depend upon't their judgment's right.
11971,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"But if you blab, you are undone:"
11972,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Consider what a risk you run:
11973,A RHAPSODY. 1733,You lose your credit all at once;
11974,A RHAPSODY. 1733,The town will mark you for a dunce;
11975,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"The vilest dogg'rel Grub Street sends,"
11976,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Will pass for yours with foes and friends;
11977,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And you must bear the whole disgrace,"
11978,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Till some fresh blockhead takes your place.
11979,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Your secret kept, your poem sunk,"
11980,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And sent in quires to line a trunk,"
11981,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"If still you be disposed to rhyme,"
11982,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Go try your hand a second time.
11983,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Again you fail: yet Safe's the word;
11984,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Take courage and attempt a third.
11985,A RHAPSODY. 1733,But first with care employ your thoughts
11986,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Where critics mark'd your former faults;
11987,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"The trivial turns, the borrow'd wit,"
11988,A RHAPSODY. 1733,The similes that nothing fit;
11989,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"The cant which every fool repeats,"
11990,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Town jests and coffeehouse conceits,"
11991,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Descriptions tedious, flat, and dry,"
11992,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And introduced the Lord knows why:
11993,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Or where we find your fury set
11994,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Against the harmless alphabet;
11995,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"On A's and B's your malice vent,"
11996,A RHAPSODY. 1733,While readers wonder whom you meant:
11997,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"A public or a private robber,"
11998,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"A statesman, or a South Sea jobber;"
11999,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"A prelate, who no God believes;"
12000,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"A parliament, or den of thieves;"
12001,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"A pickpurse at the bar or bench,"
12002,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"A duchess, or a suburb wench:"
12003,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Or oft, when epithets you link,"
12004,A RHAPSODY. 1733,In gaping lines to fill a chink;
12005,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Like stepping-stones, to save a stride,"
12006,A RHAPSODY. 1733,In streets where kennels are too wide;
12007,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Or like a heel-piece, to support"
12008,A RHAPSODY. 1733,A cripple with one foot too short;
12009,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Or like a bridge, that joins a marish"
12010,A RHAPSODY. 1733,To moorlands of a different parish.
12011,A RHAPSODY. 1733,So have I seen ill-coupled hounds
12012,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Drag different ways in miry grounds.
12013,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"So geographers, in Afric maps,"
12014,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"With savage pictures fill their gaps,"
12015,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And o'er unhabitable downs
12016,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Place elephants for want of towns.
12017,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"But, though you miss your third essay,"
12018,A RHAPSODY. 1733,You need not throw your pen away.
12019,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Lay now aside all thoughts of fame,"
12020,A RHAPSODY. 1733,To spring more profitable game.
12021,A RHAPSODY. 1733,From party merit seek support;
12022,A RHAPSODY. 1733,The vilest verse thrives best at court.
12023,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And may you ever have the luck
12024,A RHAPSODY. 1733,To rhyme almost as ill as Duck;[6]
12025,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And, though you never learn'd to scan verse"
12026,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Come out with some lampoon on D'Anvers.
12027,A RHAPSODY. 1733,A pamphlet in Sir Bob's defence
12028,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Will never fail to bring in pence:
12029,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Nor be concern'd about the sale,"
12030,A RHAPSODY. 1733,He pays his workmen on the nail.[7]
12031,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Display the blessings of the nation,"
12032,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And praise the whole administration.
12033,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Extol the bench of bishops round,"
12034,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Who at them rail, bid ---- confound;"
12035,A RHAPSODY. 1733,To bishop-haters answer thus:
12036,A RHAPSODY. 1733,(The only logic used by us)
12037,A RHAPSODY. 1733,What though they don't believe in ----
12038,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Deny them Protestants--thou lyest.
12039,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"A prince, the moment he is crown'd,"
12040,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Inherits every virtue round,"
12041,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"As emblems of the sovereign power,"
12042,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Like other baubles in the Tower;
12043,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Is generous, valiant, just, and wise,"
12044,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And so continues till he dies:

12046,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"In all their speeches, votes, addresses."
12047,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"But once you fix him in a tomb,"
12048,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"His virtues fade, his vices bloom;"
12049,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And each perfection, wrong imputed,"
12050,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Is fully at his death confuted.
12051,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"The loads of poems in his praise,"
12052,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Ascending, make one funeral blaze:"
12053,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"His panegyrics then are ceased,"
12054,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"He grows a tyrant, dunce, or beast."
12055,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"As soon as you can hear his knell,"
12056,A RHAPSODY. 1733,This god on earth turns devil in hell:
12057,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And lo! his ministers of state,"
12058,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Transform'd to imps, his levee wait;"
12059,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Where in the scenes of endless woe,"
12060,A RHAPSODY. 1733,They ply their former arts below;
12061,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And as they sail in Charon's boat,"
12062,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Contrive to bribe the judge's vote;
12063,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"To Cerberus they give a sop,"
12064,A RHAPSODY. 1733,His triple barking mouth to stop;
12065,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Or, in the ivory gate of dreams,[8]"
12066,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Project excise and South-Sea[9] schemes;
12067,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Or hire their party pamphleteers
12068,A RHAPSODY. 1733,To set Elysium by the ears.
12069,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Then, poet, if you mean to thrive,"
12070,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Employ your muse on kings alive;
12071,A RHAPSODY. 1733,With prudence gathering up a cluster
12072,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Of all the virtues you can muster,"
12073,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Which, form'd into a garland sweet,"
12074,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Lay humbly at your monarch's feet:
12075,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Who, as the odours reach his throne,"
12076,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Will smile, and think them all his own;"
12077,A RHAPSODY. 1733,For law and gospel both determine
12078,A RHAPSODY. 1733,All virtues lodge in royal ermine:
12079,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"I mean the oracles of both,"
12080,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Who shall depose it upon oath.
12081,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Your garland, in the following reign,"
12082,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Change but the names, will do again."
12083,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"But, if you think this trade too base,"
12084,A RHAPSODY. 1733,(Which seldom is the dunce's case)
12085,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Put on the critic's brow, and sit"
12086,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"At Will's, the puny judge of wit."
12087,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"A nod, a shrug, a scornful smile,"
12088,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"With caution used, may serve a while."
12089,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Proceed no further in your part,"
12090,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Before you learn the terms of art;
12091,A RHAPSODY. 1733,For you can never be too far gone
12092,A RHAPSODY. 1733,In all our modern critics' jargon:
12093,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Then talk with more authentic face
12094,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Of unities, in time and place:"
12095,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Get scraps of Horace from your friends,"
12096,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And have them at your fingers' ends;
12097,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Learn Aristotle's rules by rote,"
12098,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And at all hazards boldly quote;
12099,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Judicious Rymer[10] oft review,"
12100,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Wise Dennis,[11] and profound Bossu.[12]"
12101,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Read all the prefaces of Dryden,"
12102,A RHAPSODY. 1733,For these our critics much confide in;
12103,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Though merely writ at first for filling,"
12104,A RHAPSODY. 1733,To raise the volume's price a shilling.
12105,A RHAPSODY. 1733,A forward critic often dupes us
12106,A RHAPSODY. 1733,With sham quotations _peri hupsous_:
12107,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And if we have not read Longinus,"
12108,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Will magisterially outshine us.
12109,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Then, lest with Greek he overrun ye,"
12110,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Procure the book for love or money,"
12111,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Translated from Boileau's translation,[13]"
12112,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And quote quotation on quotation.
12113,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"At Will's you hear a poem read,"
12114,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Where Battus[14] from the table head,"
12115,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Reclining on his elbow-chair,"
12116,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Gives judgment with decisive air;
12117,A RHAPSODY. 1733,To whom the tribe of circling wits
12118,A RHAPSODY. 1733,As to an oracle submits.
12119,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"He gives directions to the town,"
12120,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"To cry it up, or run it down;"
12121,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Like courtiers, when they send a note,"
12122,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Instructing members how to vote.
12123,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"He sets the stamp of bad and good,"
12124,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Though not a word be understood.
12125,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Your lesson learn'd, you'll be secure"
12126,A RHAPSODY. 1733,To get the name of connoisseur:
12127,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And, when your merits once are known,"
12128,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Procure disciples of your own.
12129,A RHAPSODY. 1733,For poets (you can never want 'em)
12130,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Spread through Augusta Trinobantum,[15]"
12131,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Computing by their pecks of coals,"
12132,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Amount to just nine thousand souls:
12133,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"These o'er their proper districts govern,"
12134,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Of wit and humour judges sovereign.
12135,A RHAPSODY. 1733,In every street a city bard
12136,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Rules, like an alderman, his ward;"
12137,A RHAPSODY. 1733,His undisputed rights extend
12138,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Through all the lane, from end to end;"
12139,A RHAPSODY. 1733,The neighbours round admire his shrewdness
12140,A RHAPSODY. 1733,For songs of loyalty and lewdness;
12141,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Outdone by none in rhyming well,"
12142,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Although he never learn'd to spell.
12143,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Two bordering wits contend for glory;
12144,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And one is Whig, and one is Tory:"
12145,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And this, for epics claims the bays,"
12146,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And that, for elegiac lays:"
12147,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Some famed for numbers soft and smooth,"
12148,A RHAPSODY. 1733,By lovers spoke in Punch's booth;
12149,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And some as justly fame extols
12150,A RHAPSODY. 1733,For lofty lines in Smithfield drolls.
12151,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Bavius[16] in Wapping gains renown,"
12152,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And Mævius[16] reigns o'er Kentish town:
12153,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Tigellius[17] placed in Phooebus' car
12154,A RHAPSODY. 1733,From Ludgate shines to Temple-bar:
12155,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Harmonious Cibber entertains
12156,A RHAPSODY. 1733,The court with annual birth-day strains;
12157,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Whence Gay was banish'd in disgrace;[18]
12158,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Where Pope will never show his face;
12159,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Where Young must torture his invention
12160,A RHAPSODY. 1733,To flatter knaves or lose his pension.[19]
12161,A RHAPSODY. 1733,But these are not a thousandth part
12162,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Of jobbers in the poet's art,"
12163,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Attending each his proper station,"
12164,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And all in due subordination,"
12165,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Through every alley to be found,"
12166,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"In garrets high, or under ground;"
12167,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And when they join their pericranies,"

12169,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Hobbes clearly proves, that every creature"
12170,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Lives in a state of war by nature.[20]
12171,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"The greater for the smaller watch,"
12172,A RHAPSODY. 1733,But meddle seldom with their match.
12173,A RHAPSODY. 1733,A whale of moderate size will draw
12174,A RHAPSODY. 1733,A shoal of herrings down his maw;
12175,A RHAPSODY. 1733,A fox with geese his belly crams;
12176,A RHAPSODY. 1733,A wolf destroys a thousand lambs;
12177,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"But search among the rhyming race,"
12178,A RHAPSODY. 1733,The brave are worried by the base.

12182,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"On you shall rail and criticise,"
12183,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And strive to tear you limb from limb;
12184,A RHAPSODY. 1733,While others do as much for him.
12185,A RHAPSODY. 1733,The vermin only teaze and pinch
12186,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Their foes superior by an inch.
12187,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"So, naturalists observe, a flea"
12188,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Has smaller fleas that on him prey;
12189,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And these have smaller still to bite 'em,"
12190,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And so proceed _ad infinitum_.
12191,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Thus every poet, in his kind,"
12192,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Is bit by him that comes behind:
12193,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Who, though too little to be seen,"
12194,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Can teaze, and gall, and give the spleen;"
12195,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Call dunces, fools, and sons of whores,"
12196,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Lay Grub Street at each other's doors;
12197,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Extol the Greek and Roman masters,"
12198,A RHAPSODY. 1733,And curse our modern poetasters;
12199,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Complain, as many an ancient bard did,"
12200,A RHAPSODY. 1733,How genius is no more rewarded;
12201,A RHAPSODY. 1733,How wrong a taste prevails among us;
12202,A RHAPSODY. 1733,How much our ancestors outsung us:
12203,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Can personate an awkward scorn
12204,A RHAPSODY. 1733,For those who are not poets born;
12205,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"And all their brother dunces lash,"
12206,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Who crowd the press with hourly trash.
12207,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"O Grub Street! how do I bemoan thee,"
12208,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Whose graceless children scorn to own thee!
12209,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Their filial piety forgot,"
12210,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Deny their country, like a Scot;"
12211,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Though by their idiom and grimace,"

12214,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Ashamed of them, than they of thee,"
12215,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Degenerate from their ancient brood
12216,A RHAPSODY. 1733,Since first the court allow'd them food.
12217,A RHAPSODY. 1733,"Remains a difficulty still,"

13515,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,

13517,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Whose conscience always was her care,"
13518,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Thoughtful upon a point of moment,"
13519,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Would have the text as well as comment:
13520,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"So hearing of a grave divine,"
13521,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,She sent to bid him come to dine.
13522,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"But, you must know he was not quite"
13523,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,So grave as to be unpolite:
13524,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Thought human learning would not lessen
13525,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,The dignity of his profession:
13526,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"And if you'd heard the man discourse,"
13527,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Or preach, you'd like him scarce the worse."
13528,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"He long had bid the court farewell,"
13529,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Retreating silent to his cell;
13530,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Suspected for the love he bore
13531,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,To one who sway'd some time before;
13532,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Which made it more surprising how
13533,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,He should be sent for thither now.
13534,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"The message told, he gapes, and stares,"
13535,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,And scarce believes his eyes or ears:
13536,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Could not conceive what it should mean,"
13537,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,And fain would hear it told again.
13538,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"But then the squire so trim and nice,"
13539,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,'Twere rude to make him tell it twice;
13540,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"So bow'd, was thankful for the honour;"
13541,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,And would not fail to wait upon her.
13542,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"His beaver brush'd, his shoes, and gown,"
13543,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Away he trudges into town;
13544,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Passes the lower castle yard,"
13545,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"And now advancing to the guard,"
13546,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,He trembles at the thoughts of state;
13547,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"For, conscious of his sheepish gait,"
13548,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,His spirits of a sudden fail'd him;
13549,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"He stopp'd, and could not tell what ail'd him."
13550,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,What was the message I received?
13551,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Why certainly the captain raved?
13552,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,To dine with her! and come at three!
13553,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Impossible! it can't be me.
13554,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Or maybe I mistook the word;
13555,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,My lady--it must be my lord.
13556,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,My lord 's abroad; my lady too:
13557,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,What must the unhappy doctor do?
13558,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"""Is Captain Cracherode[1] here, pray?""--""No."""
13559,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"""Nay, then 'tis time for me to go."""
13560,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Am I awake, or do I dream?"
13561,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,I'm sure he call'd me by my name;
13562,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Named me as plain as he could speak;
13563,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,And yet there must be some mistake.
13564,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Why, what a jest should I have been,"
13565,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Had now my lady been within!
13566,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,What could I've said? I'm mighty glad
13567,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,She went abroad--she'd thought me mad.
13568,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,The hour of dining now is past:
13569,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Well then, I'll e'en go home and fast:"
13570,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"And, since I 'scaped being made a scoff,"
13571,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,I think I'm very fairly off.
13572,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"My lady now returning home,"
13573,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Calls ""Cracherode, is the Doctor come?"""
13574,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"He had not heard of him--""Pray see,"
13575,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"'Tis now a quarter after three."""
13576,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"The captain walks about, and searches"
13577,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Through all the rooms, and courts, and arches;"
13578,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Examines all the servants round,"
13579,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,In vain--no doctor's to be found.
13580,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,My lady could not choose but wonder;
13581,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"""Captain, I fear you've made some blunder;"
13582,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"But, pray, to-morrow go at ten;"
13583,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,I'll try his manners once again;
13584,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"If rudeness be th' effect of knowledge,"
13585,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"My son shall never see a college."""
13586,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"The captain was a man of reading,"
13587,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"And much good sense, as well as breeding;"
13588,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Who, loath to blame, or to incense,"
13589,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Said little in his own defence.
13590,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Next day another message brought;
13591,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"The Doctor, frighten'd at his fault,"
13592,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Is dress'd, and stealing through the crowd,"
13593,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Now pale as death, then blush'd and bow'd,"
13594,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Panting--and faltering--humm'd and ha'd,"
13595,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"""Her ladyship was gone abroad:"
13596,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,The captain too--he did not know
13597,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Whether he ought to stay or go;"""
13598,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Begg'd she'd forgive him. In conclusion,"
13599,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"My lady, pitying his confusion,"
13600,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Call'd her good nature to relieve him;
13601,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Told him, she thought she might believe him;"
13602,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"And would not only grant his suit,"
13603,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"But visit him, and eat some fruit,"
13604,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Provided, at a proper time,"
13605,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,He told the real truth in rhyme;
13606,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"'Twas to no purpose to oppose,"
13607,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,She'd hear of no excuse in prose.
13608,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"The Doctor stood not to debate,"
13609,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Glad to compound at any rate;
13610,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"So, bowing, seemingly complied;"
13611,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Though, if he durst, he had denied."
13612,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"But first, resolved to show his taste,"
13613,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Was too refined to give a feast;
13614,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"He'd treat with nothing that was rare,"
13615,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,But winding walks and purer air;
13616,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Would entertain without expense,"
13617,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Or pride or vain magnificence:
13618,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"For well he knew, to such a guest"
13619,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,The plainest meals must be the best.
13620,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,To stomachs clogg'd with costly fare
13621,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Simplicity alone is rare;
13622,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"While high, and nice, and curious meats"
13623,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Are really but vulgar treats.
13624,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Instead of spoils of Persian looms,"
13625,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"The costly boast of regal rooms,"
13626,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Thought it more courtly and discreet
13627,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,To scatter roses at her feet;
13628,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Roses of richest dye, that shone"
13629,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"With native lustre, like her own;"
13630,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Beauty that needs no aid of art
13631,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Through every sense to reach the heart.
13632,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"The gracious dame, though well she knew"
13633,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"All this was much beneath her due,"
13634,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Liked everything--at least thought fit
13635,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,To praise it _par manière d'acquit_.
13636,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Yet she, though seeming pleased, can't bear"
13637,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"The scorching sun, or chilling air;"
13638,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Disturb'd alike at both extremes,"
13639,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Whether he shows or hides his beams:
13640,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Though seeming pleased at all she sees,"
13641,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Starts at the ruffling of the trees,"
13642,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"And scarce can speak for want of breath,"
13643,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,In half a walk fatigued to death.
13644,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"The Doctor takes his hint from hence,"
13645,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,T' apologize his late offence:
13646,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"""Madam, the mighty power of use"
13647,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Now strangely pleads in my excuse;
13648,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,If you unused have scarcely strength
13649,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,To gain this walk's untoward length;
13650,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"If, frighten'd at a scene so rude,"
13651,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Through long disuse of solitude;
13652,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"If, long confined to fires and screens,"
13653,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,You dread the waving of these greens;
13654,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"If you, who long have breathed the fumes"
13655,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Of city fogs and crowded rooms,"
13656,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Do now solicitously shun
13657,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,The cooler air and dazzling sun;
13658,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"If his majestic eye you flee,"
13659,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Learn hence t' excuse and pity me.
13660,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Consider what it is to bear
13661,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,The powder'd courtier's witty sneer;
13662,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,To see th' important man of dress
13663,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Scoffing my college awkwardness;
13664,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"To be the strutting cornet's sport,"
13665,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"To run the gauntlet of the court,"

13669,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,Quite through the tribe of waiting gentry;
13670,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"To pass so many crowded stages,"
13671,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,And stand the staring of your pages:
13672,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"And after all, to crown my spleen,"

13674,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,"Or, if you are, be forced to bear"

13679,AN APOLOGY TO LADY CARTERET,A scene so glorious and so new?
