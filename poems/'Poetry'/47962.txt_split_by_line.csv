65,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",might properly be entrusted to one who had heard _The Hidden Servants_
66,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",and many another of these poems from the lips of Francesca herself.
67,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",
68,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","Yet, rightly considered, could any experience have better served to"
69,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","banish from the mind such irrelevant intruders as facts,—those literal"
70,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",facts and data at least which the uninitiated might be so mistaken as to
71,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","desire, but which none who knew Francesca’s work could regard as of the"
72,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",slightest consequence?
73,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",
74,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","Imagine a quiet, green-latticed room in Venice overlooking the Grand"
75,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",Canal whose waters keep time in gently audible lappings to the lilt of
76,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","the verse,—that lilt that is apparent even in the printed line, but"
77,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",which only a voice trained to Italian cadences can perfectly give.
78,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","Imagine that voice half chanting, half reciting, these old, old legends,"
79,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",and with an absolute sincerity of conviction which stirs the mind of the
80,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","listeners, mere children of to-day though they be, to a faith akin to"
81,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",that which conceived the tales. Where is there place for facts in such a
82,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","scene, in such an experience?  Or, if facts must be, are not all that"
83,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",are requisite easily to be gleaned from the poems themselves?  Why state
84,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","that Francesca is the daughter of an American artist, or that she has"
85,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","spent her life in Italy, when the artist inheritance, the Italian"
86,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","atmosphere, breathes in every poem our little book contains?  Why make"
87,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","mention even of Ruskin’s enthusiastic heralding of her work, when the"
88,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",very spirit of it is so essentially that which the great idealist was
89,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",seeking all his life that he could scarcely have failed to discover and

92,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","Venice, since it is Italy itself that lives in Francesca’s work; nor"
93,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","that she is Protestant rather than Catholic, when it is religion pure"
94,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","and simple, unrestricted by any creed, that makes vital each line she"
95,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",writes or draws.
96,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",
97,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","Yet of the poems, if not of the writer, there remained still something"
98,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","to learn, and accordingly a letter of inquiry was sent her; and her own"
99,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","reply, written with no thought of publication, is a better report than"
100,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",another could give. This is what she says:—
101,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",
102,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","""With regard to this present collection of ballads, I can tell its"
103,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",history in a few words. When I was a young girl many old and curious
104,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",books fell into my hands and became my favourite reading (next to the
105,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","Bible, and, perhaps, the _Divina Commedia_), as I found in them the"
106,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",strong faith and simple modes of thought which were what I liked and
107,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","wanted.  Afterwards, in my constant intercourse with the country people,"
108,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","and especially with old people whom I always loved, I heard a great many"
109,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","legends and traditions, often beautiful, often instructive, and which,"
110,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","as far as I knew, had never been written down.  I was always in request"
111,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","with children for the stories which I knew and could tell, and, as I"
112,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","found they liked these legends, I thought it a pity they should be lost"
113,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","after I should have passed away, and so I always meant to write them"
114,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",down; all the more that I had felt the need of such reading when I was a
115,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",child myself. But I never had time to write them as long as my eyes
116,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","permitted me to work at my drawing, and afterwards, when I wanted to"
117,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","begin them, I found myself unable to write at all for more than a few"
118,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",minutes at once.  Finally I thought of turning the stories into rhyme
119,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","and learning them all by heart, so that I could write them down little"
120,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","by little.  I thought children would not be very particular, if I could"
121,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","just make the dear old stories vivid and comprehensible, which I tried"
122,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","to do.  If, as you kindly hope, they may be good for older people as"
123,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","well, then it must be that when the Lord took from me one faculty He"
124,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",gave me another; which is in no way impossible.  And I think of the
125,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","beautiful Italian proverb: ’When God shuts a door He opens a window.’"""
126,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",
127,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",After such an account of the origin and growth of these poems no further
128,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","comment would seem fitting, unless it be that made by Cardinal Manning"
129,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",when writing to Mr. Ruskin in 1883 to thank him for a copy of
130,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",Francesca’s _Story of Ida_.  He writes:—
131,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",
132,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","""It is simply beautiful, like the _Fioretti di San Francesco_.  Such"
133,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""",flowers can grow in one soil alone.  They can be found only in the
134,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","Garden of Faith, over which the world of light hangs visibly, and is"
135,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","more intensely seen by the poor and the pure in heart than by the rich,"
136,"AUTHOR OF ""THE STORY OF IDA,""","or the learned, or the men of culture."""

147,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,
148,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_In my upper chamber here,_"
149,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Still I wait from year to year;_
150,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Wondering when the time will come_
151,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_That the Lord will call me home._
152,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_All the rest have been removed,—_"
153,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Those I worked for, those I loved;_"
154,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_And, at times, there seems to be_"
155,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Little use on earth for me._
156,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Still God keeps me—He knows why—_
157,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_When so many younger die!_
158,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,
159,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_From my window I look down_
160,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_On the busy, bustling town._"
161,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_But beyond its noise and jar_
162,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_I can see the hills afar;_
163,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_And above it, the blue sky,_"
164,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_And the white clouds sailing by;_
165,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_And the sunbeams, as they shine_"
166,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_On a world that is not mine._
167,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,
168,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Here I wait, while life shall last,_"
169,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_An old relic of the past,_"
170,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Feeling strange, and far away_"
171,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_From the people of to-day;_
172,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Thankful for the memory dear_
173,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Of a morning, always near,_"
174,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Though long vanished, and so fair!_"
175,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Dewy flowers and April air;_
176,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Thankful that the storms of noon_
177,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Spent their force and died so soon;_
178,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Thankful, as their echoes cease,_"
179,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_For this twilight hour of peace._
180,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,
181,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_But my life, to evening grown,_"
182,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Still has pleasures of its own._
183,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Up my stairway, long and steep,_"
184,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Now and then the children creep;_
185,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Gather round me, where I sit_"
186,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_All day long, and dream, and knit;_"
187,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Fill my room with happy noise—_
188,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_May God bless them, girls and boys!_"
189,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Then sweet eyes upon me shine,_"
190,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Dimpled hands are laid in mine;_
191,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_And I never ask them why_
192,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_They have sought to climb so high;_
193,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_For ’twere useless to enquire!_
194,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_’Tis a story they desire,_"
195,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Taken from my ancient store,_"
196,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_None the worse if heard before;_
197,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_And they turn, with pleading looks,_"
198,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_To my shelf of time-worn books,_"
199,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Bound in parchment brown with age._
200,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Little in them to engage_
201,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Children’s fancy, one would say!_"
202,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Yet, when tired with noisy play,_"
203,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Nothing pleases them so well_
204,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_As the stories I can tell_
205,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_From those pages, old and gray,_"
206,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_With their edges worn away;_
207,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Spelling queer, and Woodcut quaint._"
208,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Angel, demon, prince, and saint,_"
209,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Much alike in face and air;_
210,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Houses tipping here and there,_"
211,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Lion, palm-tree, hermit’s cell,_"
212,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_And much more I need not tell._
213,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,
214,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Then they all attentive wait,_"
215,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_While the story I relate,_"
216,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_And, before the half is told,_"
217,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_I forget that I am old!_
218,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_But one age there seems to be_
219,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_For the little ones and me._
220,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_What though all be new and strange,_"
221,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Little children never change;_
222,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_All is shifting day by day,—_"
223,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Worse or better, who can say?_"
224,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Much we lose, and much we learn,_"
225,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_But the children still return,_"
226,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_As the flowers do, every year;_"
227,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Just as innocent and dear_
228,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_As those babes who first did meet_
229,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_At our Heavenly Master’s feet._
230,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_In His arms He took them all:_
231,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Oh, ’tis precious to recall—_"
232,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Blessèd to believe it true—_
233,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_That what we love He loved too!_
234,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,
235,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Since the time when life was new,_"
236,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_All my long, long journey through,_"
237,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_I have story-teller been._
238,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_When a child I did begin_
239,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_To my playmates; later on,_"
240,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Other children, long since gone,_"
241,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Came to listen; and of some,_"
242,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Still the children’s children come!_
243,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,
244,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Some, the dearest, took their flight,_"
245,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_In the early morning light,_"
246,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_To the glory far away,_"
247,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Made for them and such as they._
248,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_I have lingered till the last;_
249,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_All the busy hours are past;_
250,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Now my sun is in the west,_"
251,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Slowly sinking down to rest_
252,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Ere it wholly fades from view,_"
253,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_One thing only I would do:_
254,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_From my stories I would choose_
255,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Those ’t would grieve me most to lose._
256,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_And would tell them once again_
257,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_For the children who remain,_"
258,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_And for others, yet to be,_"
259,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_Whom on earth I may not see._
260,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Here, within this volume small,_"
261,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_I have thought to write them all;_
262,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_And to-day the work commence,_"
263,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_Trusting, ere God call me hence,_"
264,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,_I may see the whole complete._
265,*THE OLD STORY-TELLER*,"_It will be a labour sweet,_"

311,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
312,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
313,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A sheltered nook on a mountain side,"
314,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Shut in, and guarded, and fortified"
315,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"By rocks that hardly a goat would climb,"
316,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,All smoothed by tempest and bleached by time—
317,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Such was the spot that the hermit chose,"
318,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"From youth to age, for his life’s repose."
319,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"There had he lived for forty years,"
320,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Trying, with penance and prayers and tears,"
321,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To make his soul like a polished stone
322,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In God’s great temple; for this alone
323,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Was the one dear wish that his soul possessed,"
324,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And ’t was little he cared for all the rest,"
325,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
326,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Nothing had changed since first he came;
327,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The sky and the mountain were all the same,"
328,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Only a beech-tree, that there had grown"
329,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Ere ever he builded his cell of stone,"
330,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Had risen and spread to a stately grace,"
331,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And its shifting shadow filled half the place.
332,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Many a winter its storms had spent,"
333,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Many a summer its sunshine lent
334,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To the little cell, till it came to look"
335,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Like another rock in the peaceful nook.
336,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Mosses and lichen had veiled the wall,"
337,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till it hardly seemed like a dwelling at all.
338,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
339,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’T was a peaceful home when the days were soft,"
340,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And spring in her sweetness crept aloft
341,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"From the plains below where her work was done,"
342,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the hills grew green in the warming sun.
343,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And in summer the cell of the hermit seemed
344,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Like part of that heaven of which he dreamed:
345,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For the turf behind those walls of flint
346,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Was sprinkled with flowers of rainbow tint;
347,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And never a sound but the bees’ low hum,"
348,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,As over the blossoms they go and come;
349,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Or—when one listened—the fainter tones
350,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of a spring that bubbled between the stones.
351,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
352,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But dreary it was on a winter’s night,"
353,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,When the snow fell heavy and soft and white.
354,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And at times, when the morn was cold and keen,"
355,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The footprints of wolves at his door were seen.
356,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But cold or hunger he hardly felt,"
357,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,So near to heaven the good man dwelt;
358,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And as for danger—why, death, to him,"
359,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Meant only joining the Seraphim!
360,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
361,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Poorly he lived, and hardly fared;"
362,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And when the acorns and roots he shared
363,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With mole or squirrel, he asked no more,"
364,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But thanked the Lord for such welcome store.
365,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The richest feast he could ever know
366,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Was when the shepherds who dwelt below,"
367,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Whose sheep in the mountain pastures fed,"
368,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Would bring him cheeses, or barley bread,"
369,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Or—after harvest—a bag of meal;
370,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And then they would all before him kneel,"
371,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"On flowery turf or on moss-grown rocks,"
372,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To ask a blessing for them and their flocks,"
373,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
374,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And once or twice he had wandered out
375,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To preach in the country round about,"
376,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where unto many his words were blest;
377,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Then back he climbed to his quiet nest.
378,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,By all in trouble his aid was sought;
379,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And women their pining children brought,"
380,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For a touch of his hand to ease their pain,"
381,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And his prayers to make them strong again.
382,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
383,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And now one wish in his heart remained:
384,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He longed to know what his soul had gained,"
385,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And how he had grown in the Master’s grace,"
386,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Since first he came to that lonely place.
387,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"This wish was haunting him night and day,"
388,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He never could drive the thought away.
389,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Until at length in the beech-tree’s shade
390,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He knelt, and with all his soul he prayed"
391,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That God would grant him to know and see
392,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A man, if such in the world might be,"
393,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown
394,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To the self-same measure as his own;
395,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Whose treasure on the celestial shore
396,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Could neither be less than his nor more.
397,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He prayed with faith, and his prayer was heard;"
398,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He hardly came to the closing word
399,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Before he felt there was some one there!
400,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He looked, and saw in the sun-lit air"
401,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"An angel, floating on wings of white;"
402,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Nor did he wonder at such a sight:
403,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For angels often had come to cheer
404,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"His soul, and he thought them always near."
405,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Happy and humble, he bowed his head,"
406,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And listened, while thus the angel said:"
407,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Go to the nearest town, and there,"
408,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To-morrow, will be in the market square"
409,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A mountebank, playing his tricks for show:"
410,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He is the man thou hast prayed to know;
411,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"His soul, as seen by the light divine,"
412,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Is neither better nor worse than thine.
413,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,His treasure on the celestial shore
414,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Is neither less than thine own nor more."""
415,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
416,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Next day, in the dim and early morn,"
417,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"By a slippery path that the sheep had worn,"
418,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The hermit went from his loved abode
419,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To the farms below, and the beaten road."
420,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The reapers, out in the field that day,"
421,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who saw him passing, did often say,"
422,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,What a mournful look the old man had!
423,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And his very voice was changed and sad.
424,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Troubled he was, and much perplexed;"
425,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With endless doubting his mind was vexed.
426,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,What—He?  A mountebank?  Both the same?
427,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,What could it mean to his soul but shame?
428,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Had his forty years been vainly spent?
429,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And then, alas! as he onward went,"
430,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"There came an evil and bitter thought,—"
431,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Had he been serving the Lord for nought?
432,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But in his fear he began to pray,"
433,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the black temptation passed away.
434,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
435,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Perhaps the mountebank yet might prove
436,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To have a soul in the Master’s love.
437,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He almost felt that it must be so,"
438,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In spite of a life that seemed so low.
439,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Perhaps he was forced such life to take,"
440,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"It might be, even for conscience’ sake;"
441,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Some cruel master the order gave,"
442,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Perhaps, for scorn of a pious slave."
443,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Or, stay—there were saints in ancient days,"
444,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Who had such terror of human praise
445,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That, but to gain the contempt they prized,"
446,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They did such things as are most despised;
447,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Feigned even madness; and more than one,"
448,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Accused of sins he had never done,"
449,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Had willingly borne disgrace and blame,"
450,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Nor said a word for his own good name!
451,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
452,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In thoughts like these had the day gone by;
453,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The sun was now in the western sky:
454,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The road, grown level and hot and wide,"
455,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With dusty hedges on either side,"
456,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Had led him close to the city gate,"
457,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where he must enter to learn his fate.
458,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
459,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Now fear did over his hope prevail:
460,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He almost wished in his search to fail,"
461,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And find no mountebank there at all!
462,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For then his vision he well might call
463,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A dream that came of its own accord,"
464,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Instead of a message from the Lord!
465,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A few more minutes, and then he knew"
466,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That all which the angel said was true!
467,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
468,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A mountebank, in the market square,"
469,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Was making the people laugh and stare.
470,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With antics more befitting an ape
471,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Than any creature in human shape!
472,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The hermit took his place with the rest,"
473,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Not heeding the crowd that round him pressed,"
474,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And earnestly set his eyes to scan
475,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The face of the poor, unsaintly man."
476,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Alas, there was little written there"
477,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of inward peace or of answered prayer!
478,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For all the paint, and the droll grimace,"
479,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’T was a haggard, anxious, weary face."
480,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
481,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The mountebank saw, with vague surprise,"
482,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The patient, sorrowful, searching eyes,"
483,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Whose look, so solemn, and kindly too,"
484,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Seemed piercing all his disguises through.
485,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They made him restless, he knew not why:"
486,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He could not play; it was vain to try!
487,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"His face grew sober, his movements slow;"
488,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And, soon as might be, he closed the show."
489,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
490,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He saw that the hermit lingered on,"
491,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,When all the rest of the crowd were gone.
492,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Then over his gaudy clothes he drew
493,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A ragged mantle of faded hue;
494,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And he himself was the first to speak:
495,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Good Father, is it for me you seek?"""
496,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""My son, I have sought you all the day;"
497,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Would you come with me a little way,"
498,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Into some quiet corner near,"
499,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Where no one our words can overhear?"""
500,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
501,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Not far away, in a lonely street,"
502,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,By a garden wall they found a seat.
503,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"It now was late, and the sun had set,"
504,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Though a golden glory lingered yet,"
505,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the moon looked pale in it overhead.
506,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They sat them down, and the hermit said:"
507,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""My son, to me was a vision sent,"
508,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And as yet I know not what it meant;
509,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But I think that you, and you alone,"
510,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Are able to make its meaning known.
511,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Answer me then—I have great need—
512,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And tell me, what is the life you lead?"""
513,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
514,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""My life’s a poor one, you may suppose!"
515,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I ’ve many troubles that no one knows;
516,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For I have to keep a smiling face.
517,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I wander, friendless, from place to place,"
518,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Risking my neck for a scanty gain;
519,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But I must do it, and not complain."
520,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I know, whatever may go amiss,"
521,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That I have deserved much worse than this."""
522,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
523,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To the hermit this a meaning bore
524,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of deep humility, nothing more."
525,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"So, gaining courage, ""But this,"" he said,"
526,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Is not the life you have always led."
527,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,So much the vision to me revealed;
528,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I know there ’s something you keep concealed."""
529,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
530,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The mountebank answered sadly: ""Yes!"
531,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’T is true: you ask, and I must confess."
532,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But keep my secret, good Father, pray;"
533,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Or my life will not be safe for a day!
534,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Alas, I have led a life of crime!"
535,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I ’ve been an evil man in my time.
536,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I was a robber—I think you know—
537,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till little more than a year ago;
538,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One of a desperate, murderous band,"
539,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A curse and terror to all the land!"""
540,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
541,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The hermit’s head sank down on his breast;
542,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,His trembling hands to his eyes he pressed.
543,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Has God rejected me?"" then he moaned:"
544,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Are all my service and love disowned?"
545,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Have I been blind, and my soul deceived?"""
546,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
547,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The other, seeing the old man grieved,"
548,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Said: ""Father, why do you care so much"
549,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For one not worthy your robe to touch?
550,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The Lord is gracious, and if He will,"
551,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He can forgive and save me still.
552,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And as for my wicked life, ’t is I,"
553,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Not you, who have reason to weep and sigh!"
554,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Your prayers may help me, and bring me peace."""
555,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
556,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The hermit made him a sign to cease;
557,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then raised his head, and began to speak,"
558,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With tears on his wrinkled, sun-browned cheek."
559,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""If you could remember even one"
560,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Good deed that you in your life have done,"
561,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I need not go in despair away.
562,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Think well; and if you can find one, say!"""
563,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
564,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Once,"" said the mountebank, ""that was all,"
565,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I did for the Lord a service small,"
566,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And never yet have I told the tale!
567,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But if you wish it, I will not fail."
568,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A few of our men had gone one day—
569,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’T was less for plunder, I think, than play—"
570,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To a certain convent, small and poor,"
571,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where a dozen sisters lived secure
572,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For very poverty! dreaming not
573,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That any envied their humble lot.
574,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"There, finding the door was locked and barred,"
575,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They climbed the wall of a grass-grown yard.
576,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Some vines were planted along its side,"
577,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Their trailing branches left room to hide;
578,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Where, neither by pity moved nor shame,"
579,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They crouched, till one of the sisters came"
580,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To gather herbs for the noonday meal;
581,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Then out from under the leaves they steal!
582,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"So she was taken, poor soul, and bound,"
583,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And carried off to our camping ground.
584,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A harmless creature, who knew no more"
585,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of the world outside her convent door,"
586,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Than you or I of the moon up there!
587,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A shame, to take her in such a snare!"
588,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
589,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""But, Father, I wished that I had been"
590,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Ten miles away, when they brought her in,"
591,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To hold for ransom; or if that failed—
592,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Oh, well, we knew when the pirates sailed!"
593,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"We knew their captain, who paid us well,"
594,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And carried our prisoners off to sell.
595,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They never beheld their country more,"
596,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Being bought for slaves on a foreign shore.
597,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
598,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""But oh! ’t was enough the tears to bring,"
599,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To see that innocent, frightened thing,"
600,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Looking, half hopeful, from face to face,"
601,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"As if she thought, in that wicked place,"
602,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,There might be one who would take her part!
603,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She looked at me, and it stung my heart."
604,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But I, with a hard, disdainful air,"
605,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Turned from her as one who did not care,"
606,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I heard her sighing: she did not know
607,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That her gentle look had hurt me so!
608,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
609,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""That night they set me the watch to keep;"
610,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And when the others were all asleep,"
611,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And I had been moving to and fro,"
612,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With branches keeping the fire aglow,"
613,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I crept along to the woman’s side,—"
614,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She sat apart, and her arms were tied,—"
615,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And said,—’t was only a whispered word;"
616,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"We both were lost if the others heard,—"
617,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’If you will trust me and with me come,"
618,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I ’ll bring you safe to your convent home.’
619,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She started, into my face she gazed;"
620,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Said she, ’I’ll trust you—the Lord be praised!’"
621,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
622,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""I very quickly the cords unbound."
623,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She rose; I led her without a sound
624,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Between the rows of the sleeping men,"
625,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till we left the camp behind; and then
626,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I found my horse, that was tied near by."
627,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The woman mounted, and she and I"
628,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Set off in haste, through the midnight shade,"
629,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,On the wildest journey I ever made!
630,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"By wood and thicket the horse I led,"
631,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And over a torrent’s stony bed,—"
632,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For along the road I dared not go,"
633,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For fear that the others our flight should know,"
634,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And follow after; the woman prayed.
635,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I, quick and cautious, but not afraid,"
636,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Went first, with the stars for guide, until"
637,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"We saw the convent, high on a hill."
638,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,We reached the door as the east grew red.
639,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,’God will remember!’ was all she said;
640,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Her face was full of a sweet content.
641,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She knocked, they opened, and in she went."
642,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The door was closed—she was safe at last!
643,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I heard the bolt as they made it fast—
644,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And I in the twilight stood alone,"
645,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With the lightest heart I had ever known!
646,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
647,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""So, Father, my robber days were o’er;"
648,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I could not be what I was before.
649,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I wandered on with a thankful mind,"
650,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For I left the old bad life behind,"
651,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And tried, as I journeyed day by day,"
652,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To gain my bread in an honest way.
653,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But little work could I find to do;
654,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And so, as some juggling tricks I knew,"
655,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I took this business which now you see:
656,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’T is good enough for a man like me!"""
657,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
658,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"While yet the story was going on,"
659,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The cloud from the hermit’s face had gone;
660,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And if his eyes in the moonlight shone,"
661,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They glistened with thankful tears alone.
662,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He listened in solemn awe until
663,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The mountebank’s tale was done; and still,"
664,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Some moments, he neither spoke nor stirred,"
665,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But silently pondered every word.
666,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
667,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then humbly speaking, ""The Lord,"" said he,"
668,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Has had great mercy on you and me!"
669,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And now, my son, I must tell you why"
670,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I came to speak with you—know that I
671,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Have tried with the Lord alone to dwell,"
672,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For forty years, in my mountain cell;"
673,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In prayer and solitude, day and night,"
674,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Have striven to keep my candle bright!
675,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And there, but yesterday, while I prayed,"
676,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"An angel came to my side, and said"
677,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That I should seek you,—and told me where,—"
678,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And should your life with my own compare;
679,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For in God’s service and love and grace
680,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Your soul with mine has an equal place,"
681,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"We both alike have his mercy shared,"
682,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The same reward is for both prepared.
683,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I came; I sought you—and you know how
684,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I found you out in the square just now!
685,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,At which—may the Lord forgive my pride!—
686,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,At first I was poorly satisfied.
687,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But now I have heard your story through—
688,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,What you in a single night could do!—
689,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And know that this to the Lord appears
690,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Worth all my service of forty years;
691,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I can but wonder, and thank His grace"
692,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Which raised us both to an equal place,"""
693,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
694,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""But, Father, it never can be true!"
695,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,What?—I by the side of a saint like you?
696,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Ah no!  You never to me were sent.
697,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’T was some one else whom the angel meant!"""
698,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
699,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""No!  Listen to me—’T was _you_, my son!"
700,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Our Master said that a service done
701,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To a child of His in time of need
702,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Is done to Himself in very deed,"
703,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And is with love by Himself received!
704,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"So do not think I have been deceived,"
705,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But keep those words on your heart engraved
706,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of the humble woman whose life you saved,"
707,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"_God will remember_, and trust His care."
708,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He will not forget you here nor there!"""
709,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
710,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""O Father, Father!  And can it be"
711,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That the Lord in heaven remembers me?
712,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And yet I had felt it must be true,"
713,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For the woman spoke as if she knew!
714,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But when was ever such mercy shown,"
715,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And is this the love He bears His own?
716,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Are these the blessings He holds in store?
717,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Oh, let me serve Him for evermore!"""
718,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
719,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And when, at the close of another day,"
720,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The hermit wearily made his way
721,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Up the mountain path, from stone to stone,"
722,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He did not climb to his cell alone.
723,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The mountebank, still with wondering face,"
724,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Came with him up to that peaceful place!
725,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
726,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Together with thankful hearts they went,"
727,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Thenceforth together their lives were spent.
728,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And, ere the summer had reached its close,"
729,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Another cell from the rocks arose;
730,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The beech, in its strong and stately growth,"
731,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Spread one green canopy over both.
732,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"On summer evenings, when shepherds guide"
733,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Their flocks to rest on the mountain side,"
734,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They heard above, in the twilight calm,"
735,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Two voices, chanting the evening psalm;"
736,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And one was agèd, and one was young,"
737,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But never was hymn more sweetly sung!
738,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
739,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In love and patience, by deed and word,"
740,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They helped each other to serve the Lord,—"
741,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Together to pray, to learn, to teach,—"
742,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till a deeper blessing fell on each.
743,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Their souls grew upward from day to day;
744,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But he who farthest had gone astray,"
745,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who, lowest fallen, had hardest striven,"
746,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who most had sinned and been most forgiven,"
747,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Erelong in the heavenly race outran
748,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The older, milder, and wiser man."
749,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Two years he dwelt with his agèd friend,"
750,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Then made a blessèd and peaceful end;
751,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And, when his penitent life was done,"
752,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The hermit wept as he would for a son!
753,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
754,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Ten years had over the mountain passed,"
755,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Since that poor mountebank breathed his last,"
756,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Helped, to the end, by a woman’s prayer,"
757,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Ten years; and the hermit still was there.
758,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Grown older, thinner, with shoulders bent,"
759,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He seldom forth from his shelter went.
760,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But those he had helped in former days
761,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With prayers and counsel, in thousand ways,"
762,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Were mindful of him, and brought him all"
763,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He needed now, for his wants were small."
764,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And happy they were their best to give,"
765,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,If only their mountain saint would live!
766,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For in his living their lives were blest;
767,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And if he longed for the perfect rest,"
768,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Patient he was, and content to wait,"
769,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"While God should please, at the heavenly gate."
770,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Beautiful now his face had grown,"
771,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But the beauty was something not his own,—"
772,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A solemn light from the blessèd land
773,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Within whose border he soon must stand.
774,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Little he said, but his every word"
775,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Was saved and treasured by those who heard,"
776,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To be a blessing in years to come,"
777,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,When he should be theirs no more; and some
778,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who brought their little to help his need,"
779,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Went home with their souls enriched indeed!
780,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
781,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One autumn morning he sat alone,"
782,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Outside his cell; and the warm sun shone
783,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With a friendly light on his silver hair,"
784,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Through the branches, smooth and almost bare,"
785,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of the beech-tree, now, like him, grown old."
786,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The night before had been sharp and cold;
787,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the frost was white on leaf and stem
788,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Wherever the rocks still shaded them,"
789,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But where the sunbeams had found their way,"
790,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In glittering, crystal drops it lay;"
791,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And fallen leaves at his feet were strewn,"
792,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Yellow and wet, over turf and stone."
793,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
794,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He sat and dreamed, as the agèd do,"
795,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"While, drifting backward, he lived anew"
796,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The years that never again should be.
797,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A placid dream—for his soul was free
798,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"From all the troubles of long ago,"
799,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The doubts, the conflict he used to know!"
800,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Doubts of himself, and a contest grim"
801,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With evil spirits that strove for him.
802,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Now all was over; that troubled day
803,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Was like a storm that had passed away.
804,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
805,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,It seemed to him that his voyage was o’er;
806,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,His ship already had touched the shore.
807,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Yet once he sighed; for he knew that he
808,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Was not the man he had hoped to be,"
809,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And, looking back on his journey past,"
810,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He felt—what all of us feel at last!
811,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And his soul was moved to pray once more
812,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The prayer he had made twelve years before,"
813,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Only to know, before he died,"
814,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,If he were worthy to stand beside
815,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One of God’s children, or great or small,"
816,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Who served Him truly; and that was all!
817,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
818,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"It was not long ere the angel came,"
819,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who, gently calling the saint by name,"
820,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Said: ""Come, for thou hast not far to go."
821,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One step, and I to thine eyes will show"
822,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The very dwelling that shelters now
823,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Two souls as near to the Lord as thou!"""
824,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
825,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The hermit rose; and with reverent tread
826,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He followed on as the angel led.
827,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where a single cleft the rocks between
828,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Gave passage out of the valley green
829,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They passed, and stood in the pathway steep:"
830,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The rocks about them were sunken deep
831,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In fern, and bramble, and purple heath,"
832,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That sloped away to the woods beneath;
833,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"While far below, and on every side,"
834,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Were endless mountains, and forests wide,"
835,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And scattered villages here and there,"
836,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That all looked near in the clear, dry air."
837,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And here a church, with its belfry tall;"
838,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And there a convent, whose massive wall"
839,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Rose grave and stately above the trees.
840,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The hermit willingly looked at these;
841,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For hope they gave him that now, at least,"
842,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Some praying brother or toiling priest
843,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Might be his mate; but it was not so!
844,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The angel showed him, away below,"
845,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A slope where a little mountain-farm
846,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Lay, all spread out in the sunshine warm,"
847,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Along the side of a wooded hill.
848,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,It looked so peaceful and far and still!
849,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And when his eye on the farmhouse fell,"
850,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The angel said: ""It is there they dwell!"
851,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Two women in heart and soul like thee.
852,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Go, find them, Brother, and thou shalt see"
853,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"All that thou art in their lives displayed."""
854,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Before the hermit an answer made,"
855,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The angel back to the skies had flown;
856,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He stood in the rocky path alone.
857,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
858,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Along the broken and winding way
859,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Between the heath and the boulders gray;
860,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Through lonely pastures that led him down
861,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To oaken woods in their autumn brown;
862,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And o’er the stones of a rippling stream,"
863,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The hermit passed, like one in a dream!"
864,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"As though the vision, had made him strong:"
865,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He hardly knew that the way was long.
866,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
867,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,’T was almost noon when he came in sight
868,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of the little farmhouse, low and white:"
869,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A sheltered lane by the orchard led,"
870,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Where mountain ash, with its berries red,"
871,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Rose high above him; and brambles, grown"
872,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"All over the rough, low wall of stone,"
873,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And tangled brier with thorny spray,"
874,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And feathered clematis, edged the way."
875,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then, turning shortly, a view he caught"
876,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of both the women for whom he sought.
877,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
878,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One, spinning, sat by the open door;"
879,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Her spindle danced on the worn stone floor.
880,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The other, just from the forest come,"
881,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Had brought a bundle of branches home,"
882,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And spread them now in the sun to dry;
883,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But both looked up as the saint drew nigh.
884,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then, on a sudden, the spindle stopped,"
885,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The branches all on the grass were dropped.
886,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He heard them joyfully both exclaim,"
887,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""The Saint!  The hermit!""  And forth they came"
888,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To bid him welcome, and made request"
889,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That he would enter their house to rest.
890,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
891,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But when a blessing they both implored,"
892,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He had not courage to speak the word.
893,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The only blessing his lips let fall
894,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Was this: ""May the good Lord bless us all,"
895,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And keep our hearts in His peace divine!"""
896,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With hand uplifted, he made the sign,"
897,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Then entered in (to their joy complete!)
898,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And willingly took the offered seat.
899,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
900,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And soon before him a meal was spread,"
901,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of chestnuts, of goat’s milk cheese, and bread;"
902,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,While one with her pitcher went to bring
903,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Some water fresh from the ice-cold spring.
904,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
905,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He could not taste of the food prepared
906,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till he his errand to both declared.
907,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Said he: ""My friends, I have come to-day"
908,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With something grave on my mind to say,"
909,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And more to hear; and I pray you now
910,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To answer truly, and not allow"
911,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A feeling, whether of pride or shame,"
912,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Or any shrinking from praise or blame,"
913,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To change the answer you both may give,"
914,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of what you are and of how you live."""
915,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
916,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then she with distaff still at her side,"
917,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of speech more ready, at once replied."
918,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In years the elder, but not in face,"
919,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She kept a little of youthful grace:
920,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The dark eyes under her snow-white hair
921,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Were keen and clear as the autumn air!
922,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
923,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""We are but what we appear to be:"
924,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Two toiling women, as you may see!"
925,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And neither so young nor strong as when
926,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In field and forest we helped the men.
927,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"We now have only the lesser care,"
928,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To keep the house, and the meals prepare,"
929,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And other labours of small account,"
930,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Yet something worth in the week’s amount.
931,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But in our youth, and a lifetime through,"
932,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"We laboured, much as the others do!"
933,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Through storm and sunshine we still have tried
934,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To do our best by our husbands’ side.
935,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And keep their hearts and our own at rest
936,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,When sickness came or when want oppressed.
937,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For even famine our house assailed
938,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That year when the corn and chestnuts failed.
939,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And once—that winter ten years ago—
940,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Our house was buried beneath the snow,"
941,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And ere it melted and light returned,"
942,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The very benches for warmth we burned!
943,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Nor is there want, in our busy hive,"
944,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of children keeping the house alive:
945,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For she has seven, and I have nine;"
946,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But three of hers and the first of mine
947,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Are safe with Jesus,—more happy they!"
948,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Two more have married and gone away.
949,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"My son’s young wife, with her infant small,"
950,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Make up the household—fourteen in all."""
951,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
952,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""In this,"" he said, ""there is much to praise:"
953,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In humble service you pass your days,"
954,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And spend your life for your children’s needs.
955,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But tell me now of the pious deeds
956,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"(For such there are) that you seek to hide,"
957,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To me in a vision signified!"""
958,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
959,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""But, sir, we are just two poor old wives."
960,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Who never have done in all our lives
961,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A pious deed that was worth the name!"""
962,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She said; and her white head drooped with shame.
963,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
964,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then said the other: ""And yet, ’t is true,"
965,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,We help in all that our husbands do.
966,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"When twice a year they have killed a sheep,"
967,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,’T is only half for ourselves we keep;
968,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Our poorer neighbours have all the rest.
969,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And this, I fear, is the very best"
970,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"We ever do!""  ""And,"" said he, ""’t is well!"
971,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But think—is there nothing more to tell?"""
972,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
973,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They both were silent a little space,"
974,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And each one questioned the other’s face,"
975,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Till, doubtful, when she had thought awhile,"
976,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The elder said, with a modest smile:"
977,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""This summer have forty years gone by,"
978,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Since she—my sister-in-law—and I
979,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Together came in this house to dwell;
980,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And, Father, it is not much to tell,"
981,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But in all these years, from first to last,"
982,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"No angry word has between us passed,"
983,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Nor even a look that was less than kind.
984,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And that is all I can call to mind."""
985,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
986,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Enough it was for the hermit’s need!
987,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He rose, like one from a burden freed."
988,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Thank God!"" he said; ""if indeed He sees"
989,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,My soul as worthy and white as these!
990,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And great the mercy He doth bestow,"
991,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That I should His hidden servants know!"""
992,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
993,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A sudden flash, as of heavenly light,"
994,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then shone within him, and all was bright;"
995,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And in a moment were things made clear
996,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Had vexed him many a weary year!
997,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For he, who had thought on earth to view"
998,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"God’s people only a scattered few,"
999,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Saw now, in spirit, an army great"
1000,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of hidden servants who on Him wait.
1001,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"No saintly legends their names disclose,"
1002,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And no man living their number knows,"
1003,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Nor can their service and place declare.
1004,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The hidden servants are everywhere!
1005,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And some are hated, despised, alone;"
1006,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And some to even themselves unknown.
1007,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But the Father’s house has room for all,"
1008,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And never one from His hand can fall!
1009,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The one brave deed of a desperate man,"
1010,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Grown hard in crime since his youth began,"
1011,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who yet, for a helpless woman’s sake,"
1012,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Had strength to rise, and his chain to break;"
1013,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The holy sweetness that fills the heart
1014,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of him who dwells from the world apart,"
1015,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"His life one dream of celestial things,"
1016,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till almost heaven to earth he brings;
1017,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Or yet the humble, unnoticed life"
1018,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of toiling mother and patient wife,"
1019,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who, year on year, has had grace to bear"
1020,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Her changeless burden of daily care,—"
1021,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Are all accepted with equal love,"
1022,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And laid with treasures that wait above
1023,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Until the day when we all believe
1024,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That every man shall his deeds receive.
1025,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1026,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And when, that evening, with weary feet"
1027,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The hermit stood by his lone retreat,"
1028,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And watched awhile, with a tranquil gaze,"
1029,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The mountains soft in the sunset haze,"
1030,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And sleeping forest, and field below,"
1031,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He said, as he saw the star-like glow"

1119,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Made an ever cool retreat,—"
1120,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1121,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"These good brethren had assembled,"
1122,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,On their abbot to attend;
1123,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"All were sad, and many trembled,"
1124,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Thinking how the day would end.
1125,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1126,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of their little congregation
1127,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One who long had faithful been,"
1128,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Had, beneath a sore temptation,"
1129,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Fallen into grievous sin.
1130,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1131,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"What it was they have not told us,"
1132,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But we know, whatever the blame,"
1133,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"If God’s hand should cease to hold us,"
1134,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,You or I might do the same.
1135,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1136,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And for judgment’s wise completing
1137,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"(Now the crime was certified),"
1138,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,All were called in solemn meeting
1139,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,On the sentence to decide.
1140,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1141,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Much in doubt, they craved assistance,"
1142,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Sent to convents far away,"
1143,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Even to that fair blue distance
1144,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where their eyes had loved to stray.
1145,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1146,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Fathers learnèd, fathers saintly,"
1147,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Abbots used to think and rule,"
1148,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Gathered where the brook sang faintly
1149,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In the shadow, green and cool."
1150,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1151,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Oh the beauty that was wasted
1152,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"On that day, remembered oft!"
1153,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Oh the sweetness, all untasted,"
1154,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of the morning, still and soft!"
1155,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1156,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"At their feet the water glistened,"
1157,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Birds were nesting overhead;
1158,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"No one saw, and no one listened"
1159,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Save to what the speakers said.
1160,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1161,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Long and sad was their debating,"
1162,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Voices low and faces grave,"
1163,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"While, the gloomy tale relating,"
1164,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Each in turn his judgment gave.
1165,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1166,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Send him from you!"" one was saying"
1167,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Calmly, as of reason sure;"
1168,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""All are tainted by his staying,"
1169,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Let men know your hands are pure!
1170,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1171,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""For the shame and sorrow brought you,"
1172,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Let him be to all as dead!
1173,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Harm sufficient has he wrought you!"""
1174,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But the abbot shook his head.
1175,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1176,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For the sin which had undone him,"
1177,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For much evil brought about,"
1178,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He would lay a burden on him,"
1179,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But he could not cast him out!
1180,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1181,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"All night long the distant howling,"
1182,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"While he waked, of beasts of prey,"
1183,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Made him think of demons prowling,"
1184,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Come to snatch that soul away.
1185,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1186,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Said another: ""I would rather"
1187,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That his shame by all were seen.
1188,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Do not spare him, O my Father;"
1189,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Let the blow be swift and keen!
1190,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1191,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Let not justice be evaded!"
1192,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Keep him, bound to labour hard,"
1193,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With you, but apart degraded,"
1194,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And from speech with all debarred!"""
1195,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1196,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"This the abbot not refusing,"
1197,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Only wondered, while he thought,"
1198,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Was there no one feared the losing
1199,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of a soul the Lord had bought?
1200,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1201,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One, more thoughtless, recommended"
1202,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That in prison closely pent
1203,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He should stay till life was ended!
1204,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But to this would none consent.
1205,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1206,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In the cell where first they closed him,"
1207,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Shrinking back, as best he might,"
1208,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,From a window that exposed him
1209,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Sometimes to a passer’s sight,"
1210,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1211,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He, the black offender, waited,"
1212,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,From them parted since his fall:
1213,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Once beloved, now scorned and hated"
1214,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"By himself, he thought by all!"
1215,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1216,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Nothing asking, nothing pleading,"
1217,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Speechless, tearless, in despair;"
1218,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But, like one in pain exceeding,"
1219,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Moving ever here and there.
1220,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1221,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Little did his fate alarm him:
1222,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,What had he to fear or shun?
1223,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,What could others do to harm him
1224,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,More than he himself had done?
1225,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1226,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But without were minds divided,"
1227,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the morning wore away;
1228,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Noon had come, and undecided"
1229,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Still the heavy question lay.
1230,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1231,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Though they looked so stern and fearless,"
1232,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Some with sinking hearts had come,—"
1233,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Hearts that wept when eyes were tearless,"
1234,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Pleaded when the lips were dumb.
1235,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1236,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One who had that morning seen him,"
1237,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Seeking from their gaze to hide,"
1238,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Tried from heavy doom to screen him;
1239,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But his reasons were denied.
1240,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1241,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He of other days was thinking,—"
1242,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Happy days, and still so near!—"
1243,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"When that brother, shamed and shrinking,"
1244,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Had to all their souls been dear.
1245,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1246,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Others tried their hearts to harden,"
1247,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Felt their pity to be sin;
1248,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Silent, prayed the Lord to pardon"
1249,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Kinder thoughts that rose within.
1250,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1251,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Some proposed and some objected,"
1252,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"While, the long debate to end,"
1253,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One old Father they expected,"
1254,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And on him would all depend.
1255,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1256,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He—their honoured, best adviser—"
1257,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Dwelt in desert cave retired;
1258,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Older than the rest, and wiser:"
1259,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Many thought his words inspired;
1260,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1261,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Said he knew what passed within them
1262,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,When by sin or doubt assailed;
1263,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"True it is, his words could win them,"
1264,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Often, when all else had failed."
1265,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1266,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He would find what all were seeking,"
1267,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Justice pure, and judgment right!"
1268,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Still the abbot, seldom speaking,"
1269,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Pale and sober, prayed for light."
1270,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1271,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Light was sent!  For, toiling slowly"
1272,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"O’er the sun-baked desert road,"
1273,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Came that Father, wise and holy,"
1274,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Bent beneath a weary load!
1275,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1276,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Scarce his failing limbs sustained him,"
1277,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For the burden sorely pressed:
1278,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Many times, as though it pained him,"
1279,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Would he stand to breathe and rest.
1280,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1281,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One who watched for his arriving,"
1282,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Went and told them he was near.
1283,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Up they rose, and ceased their striving,"
1284,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In their joy such news to hear!
1285,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1286,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then they all went forth and met him,"
1287,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,By their reverent love compelled:
1288,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Nevermore could one forget him,"
1289,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Who that day his face beheld!
1290,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1291,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Wasted, worn, yet strong to aid them;"
1292,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Peaceful, though by conflict tried;"
1293,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Shining with a light that made them
1294,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Feel the Lord was by his side!
1295,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1296,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But it grieved their souls to see him
1297,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,By that burden bowed and strained!
1298,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Many stretched their hands to free him,"
1299,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Wondering what the sack contained.
1300,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1301,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Why this burden?"" one addressed him;"
1302,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""All unfit for arms like thine!"""
1303,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He, while yet the weight oppressed him,"
1304,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Answered: ""These are sins of mine."
1305,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1306,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""I must bear them all, my brother,"
1307,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Ever with me while I go
1308,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,On my way to judge another!
1309,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"These have made my journey slow."""
1310,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1311,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then the abbot, growing bolder,"
1312,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Raised the load with trembling hand
1313,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,From the Father’s bended shoulder;
1314,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Looked—and found it filled with sand.
1315,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1316,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of them all, there was not any"
1317,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But was silent for a while;
1318,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For the best had sins as many
1319,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,As the sand-grains in that pile!
1320,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1321,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then they heard the abbot saying,"
1322,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""God alone must judge us all!"""
1323,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And a burden, heavy weighing,"
1324,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Seemed from every heart to fall.
1325,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1326,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Awed and hushed, but no more keeping"
1327,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Pity crushed, or love restrained,"
1328,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Some were smiling, some were weeping;"
1329,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of their striving what remained?
1330,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1331,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Many bowed in veneration;
1332,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Others all in haste to go
1333,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With a word of consolation
1334,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To their brother fallen low.
1335,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1336,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Hope they brought, and gentler feeling,"
1337,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To his torn, despairing breast,"
1338,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And that evening found him kneeling
1339,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In the chapel with the rest.
1340,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1341,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,None arose to judge or sentence:
1342,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He whose sin they most deplored,"
1343,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In his long and sad repentance,"
1344,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Was with charity restored.
1345,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1346,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1347,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1348,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1349,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,*Il Crocifisso della Providenza*
1350,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1351,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1352,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The crucifix about which this story is told is still to be seen in the
1353,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"church of the Carmine, where it is kept in the Corsini chapel; and it is"
1354,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"always shown to the public on the first of May, when also (as the ballad"
1355,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,relates) a _festa_ is held in the house once occupied by the three
1356,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"sisters, in the Via dell’ Orto."
1357,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1358,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The house seems to have been little changed since they lived there; it
1359,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"now bears the number 10, and is easily recognized by a niche in the"
1360,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"wall, containing a representation of the crucifix, and the chest piled"
1361,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,with loaves.
1362,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1363,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"From time immemorial, a lamp burns every night before this little"
1364,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,shrine: the oil is provided by the poor women of the vicinity (and they
1365,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"are very poor indeed), each one laying by a few _centesimi_ every week"
1366,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,for the purpose.
1367,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1368,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1369,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,*Il Crocifisso della Providenza*
1370,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1371,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1372,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The streets of Florence are fair to see,"
1373,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With palace and church and tower,"
1374,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And there the mighty of earth have dwelt,"
1375,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the whole world feels their power.
1376,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1377,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And many come from the East and West
1378,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To gaze on its beauty rare;
1379,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To stand where the wise and great have stood,"
1380,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For their presence is ever there.
1381,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1382,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But they never think of the narrow streets
1383,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where the poor of the city dwell;
1384,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Those humble houses, so bare and plain,"
1385,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Have tales of their own to tell.
1386,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1387,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"There’s one by the San Frediano gate,"
1388,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Not far from the city wall;
1389,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Some Latin words on its front engraved
1390,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The memory still recall
1391,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1392,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of one, a beggar, to all unknown,"
1393,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Who knocked at the door one day;
1394,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of what a blessing he left behind
1395,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That morn when he went his way,"
1396,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1397,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"It happened hundreds of years ago,"
1398,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But they tell the story still;
1399,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"So listen now to the legend old,"
1400,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And smile at it if you will.
1401,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1402,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But if you smile, be it not in scorn;"
1403,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The tale which I now relate
1404,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Has lightened many a heavy heart
1405,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,By the San Frediano gate.
1406,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1407,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Long since, they say, in that ancient house"
1408,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"There were orphan maidens three,"
1409,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And in the chamber above the door,"
1410,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Whose window you still may see,"
1411,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1412,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They worked and prayed, by the world unseen;"
1413,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And ever, the long day through,"
1414,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The needles stitched, and the spindle twirled,"
1415,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the knitted garment grew.
1416,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1417,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"So young, and one of them yet a child,"
1418,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With never an earthly friend;
1419,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They prayed each day for the daily bread
1420,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Which they knew the Lord would send.
1421,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1422,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And toiling cheerfully, lived content,"
1423,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Nor ever of want complained,"
1424,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But freely shared with the needy poor
1425,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The little their labour gained.
1426,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1427,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But evil days to the sisters came,"
1428,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And their faith was sorely tried:
1429,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A merchant, one of the first in town,"
1430,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That winter had failed and died.
1431,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1432,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And many debts had he left behind,"
1433,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And their work was all unpaid;
1434,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For he it was who had bought and sold
1435,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The delicate wares they made.
1436,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1437,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They prayed for help, and they sought for work;"
1438,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But awhile they sought in vain.
1439,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They pledged the ring that their father wore,"
1440,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And their mother’s golden chain.
1441,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1442,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then work they found, but for neighbours poor,"
1443,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And some of them could not pay;
1444,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’T was well for them that the spring began,"
1445,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the cold had passed away.
1446,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1447,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And one by one, as the days went on,"
1448,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Were the household treasures sold,—"
1449,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The copper pitcher, the brazen lamp,"
1450,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And the nut-wood table old,"
1451,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1452,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The pot of pinks from the window-sill—
1453,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But when they had sold them all,"
1454,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"An ancient crucifix, carved in wood,"
1455,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Still hung on the whitewashed wall
1456,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1457,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Above the chest where the loaves were kept;
1458,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Such blessing its presence shed,"
1459,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"It seemed to them like a living friend,"
1460,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And not like an image dead!
1461,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1462,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In all their troubles, in all their joys,"
1463,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That crucifix bore a part;
1464,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Above all comfort, or wealth, or gain,"
1465,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,’T was dear to the sisters’ heart!
1466,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1467,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"As babes, before they could understand,"
1468,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Or ever a prayer repeat,"
1469,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Each day their father had held them up,"
1470,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,While they kissed the carven feet.
1471,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1472,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"So April came, and so April went;"
1473,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And they lived, the Lord knows how!"
1474,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The elder sister had saved and spared,"
1475,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But the chest was empty now.
1476,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1477,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That very evening she broke in halves,"
1478,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And gave to the younger two,"
1479,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,One piece of bread—’t was the last they had;
1480,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"There was nothing more to do,"
1481,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1482,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Unless, unless—and she looked at them,"
1483,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And then at the image dear:
1484,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She touched it once; but her hand drew back
1485,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With a guilty, shrinking fear."
1486,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1487,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Her sisters saw, and they started up,"
1488,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And they said in haste, ""Not so!"
1489,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Take back the bread, if there be no more;"
1490,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The crucifix must not go!"""
1491,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1492,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And she took courage, and kissed them both,"
1493,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And smiled, though her eyes were wet;"
1494,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then looked again at the face beloved,"
1495,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And said, ""He will help us yet!"""
1496,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1497,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They rose next day with the early dawn,"
1498,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And their hearts were almost light!
1499,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The young need little to make them glad,"
1500,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the day was fair and bright.
1501,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1502,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And pleasant ’t is to behold the sun,"
1503,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Though his rosy-tinted ray
1504,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Could only shine on the moss-grown tiles
1505,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of the roof across the way.
1506,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1507,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the air was sweet in the narrow street
1508,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where the swallows toss and glide;
1509,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For a perfume came on the morning breeze
1510,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"From the hills on every side,—"
1511,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1512,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A perfume faint from the woods afar,"
1513,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,From blossoming fields of corn;
1514,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And bells already their chimes began,"
1515,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For this was a sacred morn.
1516,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1517,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The Carmine church is near at hand,"
1518,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the sisters thither hied;
1519,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,’T was there they had knelt in happy days
1520,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,By the dear dead mother’s side.
1521,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1522,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then home, through the gay and festive street,"
1523,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till they reached the chamber bare:
1524,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The time had come for the morning meal,"
1525,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And alas, no bread was there!"
1526,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1527,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The elder girl on her sisters looked,"
1528,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And her face grew white with pain.
1529,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then said the one who was next in age,"
1530,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Let us ask the Lord again!"""
1531,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1532,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"So down they knelt on the red-tiled floor,"
1533,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And the elder bowed her head,"
1534,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And said aloud, while the others joined,"
1535,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The prayer for their daily bread.
1536,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1537,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And then, with a tempest in her heart"
1538,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That she could no more withstand,"
1539,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With her arm around the younger girl,"
1540,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And the other by the hand,"
1541,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1542,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She pleaded, raising her tearful face"
1543,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To the dying face above,"
1544,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For those she loved in their helpless state
1545,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With more than a sister’s love.
1546,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1547,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""O blessed Jesus!  O Lord divine!"
1548,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Have pity, we wait for Thee!"
1549,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Look down—Thou seest our empty chest,"
1550,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Thou knowest how poor we be!
1551,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1552,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Oh, send some bread to my sisters dear,"
1553,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For the cornfields all are Thine!
1554,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I ’d rather lie in my grave to-day
1555,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Than to see these children pine!
1556,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1557,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Thou knowest, Lord, I have done my best;"
1558,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But my hands have failed at length:
1559,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A mother’s burden is on me laid
1560,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With only a maiden’s strength.
1561,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1562,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Come, help me!  Look at these orphan girls!"
1563,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Oh, save them from want and woe!—"""
1564,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Her praying ceased, for they heard a sound,"
1565,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A knock at the door below.
1566,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1567,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They rose, and all to the window went:"
1568,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A beggar was at the door,"
1569,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A poor, pale stranger, with staff in hand,"
1570,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Who had never come before.
1571,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1572,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The Month of Mary was coming in;
1573,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And many were on their way
1574,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To ask for alms in the Virgin’s name
1575,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,On that beautiful first of May.
1576,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1577,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""My little sisters,"" the beggar said,"
1578,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"(And bowed to the maidens three,)"
1579,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""I pray you spare from your table spread"
1580,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A morsel of bread for me!
1581,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1582,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""I come from far, and I ’ve far to go;"
1583,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And I ’ve eaten nought to-day!"""
1584,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The elder wept, but she answered not;"
1585,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the second turned away.
1586,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1587,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The younger looked with her innocent eyes
1588,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In the beggar’s pleading face:
1589,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""And if we could, we would give you food;"
1590,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But we ’re in as hard a case!
1591,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1592,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""We finished yesterday all we had—"
1593,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The half of a loaf, no more!—"
1594,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"We just were asking the Lord for bread,"
1595,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"When we heard you at the door."""
1596,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1597,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Go, look in the chest, my little maid;"
1598,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"You ’ll find there is bread to spare!"""
1599,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Alas, we have looked so many times,"
1600,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And never a crust is there!"""
1601,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1602,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Look once again, for the love of Him"
1603,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Whose image I see within:
1604,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He never has failed to help His own,"
1605,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And He will not now begin."""
1606,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1607,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,So only lest it should seem unkind
1608,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To refuse the small request,"
1609,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The elder girl with a patient smile
1610,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Went back to the empty chest.
1611,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1612,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She looked—and down on her knees she fell,"
1613,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With a cry of glad surprise:
1614,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The others turned, and their breath stood still,"
1615,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They could scarce believe their eyes!
1616,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1617,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,’T was full!  And the loaves were piled so high
1618,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They could close the lid no more.
1619,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Their tears fell faster for joy that day
1620,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Than they fell for grief before!
1621,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1622,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But in the midst of their thankful praise
1623,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They thought of the starving man:
1624,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The little one seized the topmost loaf,"
1625,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And back to the window ran.
1626,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1627,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She looked, she called him—he was not there!"
1628,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They sought him, but all in vain:"
1629,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He passed away from their sight that day,"
1630,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And he came no more again.
1631,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1632,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,So ends the story; but ever since
1633,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That crucifix bears the name
1634,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,_La Providenza_; and even now
1635,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The house has a sacred fame.
1636,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1637,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And many kneel where the sisters knelt
1638,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Each year on the first of May;
1639,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And the floor is all bestrewn with flowers,"
1640,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And leaves of the scented bay.
1641,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1642,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The humble room is with roses decked.
1643,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And bright with the candles’ glow;
1644,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And smoke of incense, and sound of psalm,"
1645,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Float over the street below.
1646,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1647,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A woman agèd and silver-haired
1648,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Once told me, with solemn thrill,"
1649,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"How she herself had beheld the chest,"
1650,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Which stands in the chamber still.
1651,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1652,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I asked her: ""Who was that beggarman?"
1653,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"An angel, do you suppose?"
1654,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A saint from heaven?""  Her face grew grave,"
1655,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And she answered me, ""Who knows?"""
1656,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1657,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And then, with voice to a whisper dropped,"
1658,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With an awed, mysterious air,"
1659,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Some think,"" she said, ""’t was the Lord Himself"
1660,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who came at the maiden’s prayer."""
1661,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1662,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1663,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1664,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1665,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,*Angels in the Churchyard*
1666,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1667,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1668,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The story of the ""Angels in the Churchyard"" was told me by Signore"
1669,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Bortolo Zanchetta of Bassano, who said that he read it in an old book,"
1670,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"but he had lost the book, and could not even remember its name."
1671,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1672,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1673,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,*Angels in the Churchyard*
1674,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1675,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1676,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A saint there was, long time ago,"
1677,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And all in vain I tried
1678,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"His name to learn, or whence he came,"
1679,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Or how or where he died.
1680,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1681,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For he from whom the tale I heard
1682,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Could tell me nothing more
1683,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Save only that within him dwelt
1684,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of love an endless store.
1685,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1686,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And in the churchyard once he passed
1687,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A summer night in prayer,"
1688,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For pity of the nameless dead
1689,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Who lie forgotten there.
1690,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1691,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He knew not when the sun went down,"
1692,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,So earnestly he prayed!
1693,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He knew not when the twilight glow
1694,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Was lost in deepening shade.
1695,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1696,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And when the fair, round moon arose"
1697,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Behind the wooded hill,"
1698,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She looked across the churchyard wall,"
1699,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And found him praying still.
1700,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1701,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But when the night was far along,"
1702,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And when the moon was high,"
1703,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"When all the village lights were out,"
1704,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And closed was every eye,—"
1705,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1706,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,When low above the sleeping dead
1707,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The folded daisies slept,"
1708,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And he alone his patient watch
1709,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Until the morning kept,—"
1710,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1711,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Came angels through the churchyard gate,"
1712,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But in no heavenly guise;
1713,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"So unadorned, he little thought"
1714,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They came from Paradise!
1715,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1716,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The moon lit up their robes of white;
1717,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,No other glory shone.
1718,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He watched them, as they paused before"
1719,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One sunken, moss-grown stone,"
1720,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1721,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And thrice their silver censers swung,"
1722,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"As at some saintly shrine,"
1723,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But never incense burnt on earth
1724,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Had perfume so divine.
1725,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1726,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Between the graves they glided on:
1727,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Toward a cross they turned—
1728,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A wooden cross that bore no name—
1729,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And there the incense burned.
1730,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1731,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A fading garland on it hung,"
1732,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of wild flowers simply twined;
1733,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Whoever lay in that poor grave
1734,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Had left some love behind.
1735,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1736,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But next they sought a dreary place
1737,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Against the northern wall;
1738,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He could not see if mound were there,"
1739,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The nettles grew so tall!
1740,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1741,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And on to others, three or four,"
1742,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Their noiseless steps they bent:
1743,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Where’er they stayed, the incense rose;"
1744,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then, as they came, they went."
1745,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1746,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But often to that churchyard green
1747,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Did he at night repair;
1748,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And ever, when the hour returned,"
1749,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The angels all were there.
1750,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1751,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He thought them only white-robed priests;
1752,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And much he wondered why
1753,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Each night at certain graves they stayed,"
1754,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,While others they passed by.
1755,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1756,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Till, after waiting, wondering long,"
1757,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One night he forward pressed,"
1758,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And spoke with one who walked apart,"
1759,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A step behind the rest.
1760,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1761,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,’T was starlight now; the moon had waned:
1762,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He hardly saw the face
1763,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of him he talked with; but he felt
1764,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Great peace was in the place.
1765,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1766,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Of God’s own saints,"" the angel said,"
1767,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""A few lie buried here;"
1768,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And He so loves them that to Him
1769,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Their very dust is dear!
1770,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1771,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""So, while their souls with perfect peace"
1772,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Are in His presence blest,"
1773,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He will not that these humble graves
1774,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Should all unhonoured rest.
1775,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1776,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Each night from heaven He sends us down."
1777,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where’er His flowers are sown—
1778,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"These bodies that shall one day rise,"
1779,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"All glorious like His own!"""
1780,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1781,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The saint was silent, for his lips"
1782,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Could find no word to say:
1783,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He stood entranced, and like to one"
1784,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Whose soul is far away.
1785,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1786,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"At length he roused; the stars were dim,"
1787,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The night had half withdrawn:
1788,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A light was in the eastern sky,"
1789,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The clear pale light of dawn.
1790,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1791,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then came a freshening in the air,"
1792,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A twitter in the trees,"
1793,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A ripple in the dewy grass
1794,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That felt the early breeze;
1795,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1796,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And sounded from the tower above
1797,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The sweet-toned, ancient bell;"
1798,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,While bright and busy over all
1799,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The summer morning fell.
1800,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1801,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The daisies opened; happy birds
1802,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Sang in the sunshine free.
1803,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The dead alone are sleeping now;
1804,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Their morning is to be.

1809,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,*The Origin of the Indian Corn*
1810,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1811,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1812,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,This story was told me by the Contessa Vittoria Percoto Antonini of
1813,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Palmanuova, who said that she heard it in her youth at a _Fila_, which"
1814,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,is a sort of social gathering held in the winter evenings by the
1815,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,_contadini_ in that part of the country.
1816,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1817,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The winter is cold, and these _contadini_, who are very poor and can ill"
1818,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"afford the wood for a fire, meet in the cattle-shed, where the breath of"
1819,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,cows and oxen warms the air a little.
1820,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1821,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They often say, ""It is the way that the Gesù Bambino was warmed!""  A"
1822,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"lantern hangs from one of the beams overhead, and by its dim light the"
1823,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"women spin or knit.  All talk together, and (as the Contessa Vittoria"
1824,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"expresses it) ""the boys make themselves agreeable to the girls, very"
1825,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"much as though it were a party of ladies and gentlemen."""
1826,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1827,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And from time to time the elder people entertain the company with
1828,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"stories, of which this is a pretty fair specimen."
1829,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1830,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,

1833,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,*A Legend of Friuli*
1834,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1835,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1836,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In the far Italian border land,"
1837,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With its rolling hills and mountains grand,"
1838,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And the Alps of Carnia rising near,"
1839,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where the snow lies more than half the year;
1840,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With crags where the clinging fir-trees grow
1841,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Above the chestnuts and vines below,"
1842,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"From the weary, changing world remote,—"
1843,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,There age on age doth a legend float.
1844,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The young have learnt it from agèd men;
1845,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,It never was written yet with pen.
1846,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"It seems at first, when they tell it o’er,"
1847,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A childish fancy, and nothing more;"
1848,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And bearing the impress, deep indeed,"
1849,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of the hard and struggling lives they lead:
1850,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A thing to smile at, and then forget,"
1851,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Scarce worthy a passing thought—and yet
1852,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The simple tale may a lesson teach
1853,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,If only one can its meaning reach!
1854,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Like one of their living, hill-side springs,"
1855,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That shows the image of common things;
1856,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,So he who looks on its surface sees
1857,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The bending flowers, the arching trees,"
1858,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The sun, the shadow, the rocks, the sky,"
1859,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The busy birds that go flitting by,"
1860,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,While deep below is the endless wealth
1861,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of water, given for life and health."
1862,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1863,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In homely form is the lesson taught;
1864,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But worthy still of a reverent thought.
1865,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"So listen, think; if you have a mind"
1866,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To seek, and the hidden treasure find:"
1867,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For Truth, most precious and fair, doth dwell"
1868,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In the crystal depth of this mountain well.
1869,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1870,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And this is the story, often told"
1871,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In the winter evenings long and cold;
1872,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In the low-roofed, dimly lighted shed,"
1873,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Where the breath of oxen serves instead
1874,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of a blazing hearth to warm the place:
1875,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A smile of peace is on every face,"
1876,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And hearts are light, and they often say,"
1877,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Our Lord was warmed in the self-same way,"
1878,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That night when He on the earth was born!"""
1879,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And the shed no longer seems forlorn,"
1880,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For it makes them feel Him near at hand:
1881,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And they the better can understand
1882,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,How by His pity and timely aid
1883,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The beautiful Indian corn was made.
1884,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1885,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’T was in the days when He dwelt below,"
1886,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Before ’t was given to man to know
1887,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Or who He was or from whence He came;
1888,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the world had hardly heard His name!
1889,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He journeyed over the country roads,"
1890,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He taught the poor, and He eased their loads."
1891,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He had no dwelling wherein to rest
1892,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With the one or two who loved Him best,"
1893,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And once in seeking a friendly door
1894,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They came to a farmer’s threshing-floor.
1895,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The hot July had but just begun;
1896,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The road lay white in the blinding sun;
1897,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The air was heavy with odours sweet;
1898,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The sky was pale, as if faint with heat."
1899,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Two weary men and two women pale
1900,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Were threshing, each with a heavy flail,—"
1901,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A mile away you could hear the sound
1902,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In measured cadence along the ground.
1903,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then, moved with pity at such a sight,"
1904,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,It pleased Him to make their burden light.
1905,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,At first He prayed them to pause and rest;
1906,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They only smiled at the strange request,"
1907,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And laboured on till He spoke again:
1908,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Fear not, Myself I will thresh the grain!"""
1909,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1910,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"At sound of His holy voice, they knew"
1911,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That what He said He would surely do!
1912,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He bade them bring Him a burning brand,"
1913,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And, though they little could understand,"
1914,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The brand was brought, and they saw Him bend,"
1915,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And touch the corn with the lighted end.
1916,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then swiftly, as by a tempest blown,"
1917,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The straw to the farther side was thrown;
1918,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The wheaten kernels, all clear and bright,"
1919,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Lay piled on high—’t was a pleasant sight!
1920,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Another and smaller heap contained
1921,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The chaff, and whatever else remained."
1922,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’T was threshed and winnowed, and all in one;"
1923,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The work of days in a moment done!
1924,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The happy threshers, with one accord,"
1925,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Gave thanks and praise to the blessèd Lord;
1926,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And grateful tears at His feet were shed.
1927,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1928,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Meanwhile the news through the village spread;
1929,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For more than one had been near, and seen"
1930,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The miracle of the wheat made clean.
1931,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"From field and garden and cottage door,"
1932,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The people flocked to the threshing-floor.
1933,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Then came a time of such joy supreme
1934,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,As never had been in thought or dream.
1935,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For when they looked on the clean-threshed wheat,"
1936,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And heard the threshers their tale repeat,"
1937,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And knew that He had this wonder done,"
1938,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They knelt and worshipped Him, every one!"
1939,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Oh, think how happy they were and blest,"
1940,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Who might awhile in His presence rest!
1941,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Think what it would be for you or me
1942,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That voice to hear and that face to see!
1943,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The children run to Him where He stands,"
1944,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And cling with their little sunbrowned hands
1945,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To His garment; and the parents feel
1946,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Their burden lightened while yet they kneel.
1947,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Thank God, who spared us!"" the agèd say,"
1948,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""To look on Thy blessèd face to-day!"""
1949,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The sick are healed, and the weak made strong,"
1950,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And hearts consoled that had suffered long:
1951,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A sound of gladness, of praise and prayer,"
1952,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Floats far away on the summer air.
1953,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1954,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Amid such transports of young and old,"
1955,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,How was it that one could still be cold?
1956,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A certain widow whom all confessed
1957,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To be the bravest, perhaps the best,"
1958,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Among the women the place contained—
1959,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Why was it that she aloof remained?
1960,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1961,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Handsome and stately, and strong of arm"
1962,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To guard her fatherless babes from harm,"
1963,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,With five little hungry mouths to fill;
1964,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For them she laboured with might and will!
1965,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But, proud of spirit, she could not bear"
1966,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That other hearts should her burden share.
1967,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of soul too high for an evil deed,"
1968,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She scorned the others, but helped their need."
1969,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In wit and wisdom the rest excelled,"
1970,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And yet their kindness too oft repelled;
1971,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Accepted nothing, though free to give,"
1972,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And almost rather had ceased to live
1973,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Than share the loaf from a neighbour’s shelf.
1974,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Yes, proud of her very pride itself!"
1975,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1976,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She nursed it, cherished it, thought it grand,"
1977,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To guide unaided her house and land,"
1978,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And thanked the Lord, when she knelt to pray,"
1979,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That never one in the place could say,"
1980,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""I help the widow!""  And now she stood"
1981,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Apart from the kneeling multitude,"
1982,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And half impatient and half amused,"
1983,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She smiled at the simple words they used,"
1984,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of praise and wonder, and thought how she"
1985,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Could never so weak and childish be!
1986,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1987,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For her ’t was a proud and happy day,"
1988,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For rest and plenty before her lay:
1989,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Herself had sown and herself had reaped;
1990,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And now the beautiful sheaves lay heaped,"
1991,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Not far away, by her open door;"
1992,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Her heart rejoiced in the ample store!
1993,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A neighbour saw her, and called her name:"
1994,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Come near! perhaps He will do the same"
1995,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For thee, and thy summer’s work complete;"
1996,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I know that thou hast not threshed thy wheat!"""
1997,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
1998,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She tossed her head with a smile of pride:
1999,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""I never yet, since my husband died,"
2000,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Asked help or favour of any one!
2001,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Besides, I saw how the thing was done."
2002,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And I can do it as well as He;
2003,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He need not turn from His way for me!"""
2004,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She looked on the awed, adoring crowd,"
2005,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In scorn a moment; then laughed aloud,"
2006,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To see the horror among them spread,"
2007,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,At sound of the evil words she said.
2008,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2009,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Our Lord’s disciples, though saints they were,"
2010,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Had no good wishes that day for her!
2011,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Indeed, their patience was greatly tried"
2012,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To see Him slighted and thrust aside.
2013,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One even whispered, ""Hast Thou not heard?"""
2014,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But He said never an angry word!
2015,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"One look of pity He on her cast,"
2016,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then turned, and forth from the village passed,"
2017,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Along the lane where the grass was brown,"
2018,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And birds were plucking the thistle-down,"
2019,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till under the olives’ silver screen
2020,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He turned aside, and no more was seen."
2021,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2022,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And now the widow of heart so proud
2023,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Would show to the grave, indignant crowd"
2024,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Her greater wisdom; with this intent
2025,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She calmly in to her fireside went;
2026,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Some coals she brought in an iron pan—
2027,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""If one can do it, another can!"""
2028,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She said; and then with a careless smile
2029,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She touched the coals to her golden pile.
2030,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2031,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A flash, a crackle, a blinding blaze"
2032,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of flame, that struggles, and soars, and sways,"
2033,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And sinks a moment, and soars again—"
2034,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That was the end of the widow’s grain!
2035,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A few short moments, and nought remained"
2036,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of all that her loving toil had gained
2037,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But blackened tinder, and embers red,"
2038,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And the sullen smoke-cloud overhead!
2039,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2040,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Her friends and neighbours, I fear, meanwhile"
2041,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Were far less minded to weep than smile;
2042,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And hardly one was with pity moved,"
2043,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For the woman was not greatly loved.
2044,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And all were angry, as well as grieved,"
2045,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To think of the slight our Lord received,"
2046,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"After his wonderful goodness shown,"
2047,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And when He had made their cares His own!
2048,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2049,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The boys were ready to dance and shout,"
2050,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,At seeing the red sparks blown about;
2051,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The maidens whispered and laughed aside;
2052,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Their parents talked on the sin of pride.
2053,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To help or comfort her, no one planned,"
2054,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Except the poorest of all the band;
2055,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"An agèd woman, who near her came,"
2056,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And drew her back from the scorching flame.
2057,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Poor soul!"" she said, ""thou hast children five!"
2058,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And I have none in the world alive.
2059,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Keep up thy heart!  I am well content
2060,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To share with thee what the Lord has sent.
2061,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I just have gathered my harvest store,"
2062,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And when ’t is gone, He will send us more!"""
2063,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2064,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In vain they spoke to her, ill or good;"
2065,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She neither listened nor understood.
2066,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She minded not if they frowned or smiled;
2067,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Her face was white, and her eyes were wild,"
2068,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"As, lost in horror, she stood and gazed"
2069,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To see the corn by her labour raised,"
2070,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Their store of food for the coming year,"
2071,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Consume before her and disappear!
2072,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then came the cry of a little child,"
2073,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"From sleep awakened, in terror wild."
2074,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That cry brought life to her fainting heart;
2075,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She turned around with a sudden start,"
2076,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And said, in a husky voice and low,"
2077,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Which way did that Blessèd Stranger go?"""
2078,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2079,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A storm of voices around her rose;
2080,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The woman’s purpose they all oppose.
2081,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""_Which way?_"" they angrily say; ""but how?"
2082,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Wilt thou have courage to seek him now?
2083,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And after thy shameful words to-day,"
2084,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Is He to stop for thee on His way?
2085,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Is He to come when He hears thy call?
2086,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But, woman, hast thou no shame at all?"""
2087,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Nay, go not near Him!"" another said:"
2088,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""That man has power to strike thee dead,"
2089,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And thou hast angered Him!  Let Him go—
2090,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Thy pride has ruined thee; be it so!"""
2091,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2092,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Though none to help her a hand would lend,"
2093,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That gray-haired woman was still her friend;
2094,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She could not speak, for her voice was drowned"
2095,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In such a tumult of angry sound.
2096,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She only made with her wrinkled hand
2097,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A sign the widow could understand,"
2098,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And quick as thought, and before they knew,"
2099,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Away on her wild pursuit she flew.
2100,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2101,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Our Blessèd Lord, with His followers few,"
2102,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Had journeyed on for a mile or two,"
2103,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"When, on the brow of a rocky hill,"
2104,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The others noticed that He stood still
2105,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And looked behind Him; they did the same.
2106,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A woman running toward them came,"
2107,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Running and stumbling, and falling oft,"
2108,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And throwing wildly her arms aloft,"
2109,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,As if entreating them still to stay
2110,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till she could finish the toilsome way!
2111,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They looked; and pity their souls possessed
2112,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,At first in seeing her thus distressed;
2113,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But when they knew her, their hearts grew hard,"
2114,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Nor would they longer her prayers regard.
2115,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Good Lord, that woman it is,"" they say,"
2116,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Who scorned and slighted Thee so to-day."
2117,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"She knows her folly, perhaps, too late;"
2118,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For her, most surely, we should not wait!"""
2119,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""She needs me now!"" was His sole reply;"
2120,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And still He waited—they wondered why!
2121,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2122,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Down in the dust at His feet she fell:
2123,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Her doleful story she could not tell,"
2124,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For speech had failed, and she vainly tried:"
2125,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But, stretching her helpless hands, she cried"
2126,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"(With lips that hardly the words could form,"
2127,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They trembled so with the inward storm),"
2128,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Good Lord, have patience, and pity take"
2129,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"On me, for the innocent children’s sake!"""
2130,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And then from her eyes began to pour
2131,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A flood of tears, and she said no more."
2132,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She dropped her head on her heaving breast;
2133,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But He in His wisdom knew the rest.
2134,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And when He looked on her, bowed and crushed,"
2135,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Her pride all broken, her boasting hushed,"
2136,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Take heart!"" He said: ""I will give thee more"
2137,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And better grain than thou hadst before."""
2138,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2139,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The day was drawing toward a close,"
2140,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The sky was clear in its deep repose;
2141,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The sun, just sinking away from sight,"
2142,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Had touched with a solemn crimson light
2143,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The smoky column that, dark and thin,"
2144,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Still rose where the widow’s sheaves had been.
2145,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The neighbours lingered, or came and went"
2146,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To look, and talk of the day’s event."
2147,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And, smiling grimly the wreck to view,"
2148,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Some said: ""The widow has had her due!"""
2149,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But more of them shook their heads and sighed,"
2150,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,To think of the bitter fruits of pride.
2151,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And one old woman looked down the lane,"
2152,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And wished the widow would come again!
2153,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The five poor little ones sat forlorn,"
2154,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Beside the blackened and wasted corn;
2155,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And ate the bread that the neighbours brought:
2156,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For them, at least, there was pitying thought."
2157,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"No sin of theirs, if the corn was burned!"
2158,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And then it was that the Lord returned.
2159,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2160,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Returned, as ever, to save and bless!"
2161,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And while the people around Him press,"
2162,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The widow kneels and the children weep,"
2163,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He lays His hand on the smouldering heap.
2164,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,His touch has the evil work undone;
2165,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And in the light of the setting sun
2166,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The corn returned where the ashes lay;
2167,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But not as it was at noon that day.
2168,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To twice their size had the kernels grown,"
2169,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And each with a burning lustre shone.
2170,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For, since that grain through the fire has passed,"
2171,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,’T will bear its colour until the last!
2172,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2173,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A few, in seeing the store increased"
2174,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of her who seemed to deserve it least,"
2175,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Began to murmur; and yet, maybe,"
2176,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Themselves were more in the wrong than she!
2177,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With all her folly, with all her sin—"
2178,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For all her ignorant pride had been
2179,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Far more, alas, than her reason strong,—"
2180,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,She never did Him that grievous wrong
2181,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of thinking He could refuse the prayer
2182,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of one who sought Him in her despair;
2183,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Or that her sin, were it twice as great,"
2184,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Could close His heart to her woful state;
2185,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Or lie so heavily on her soul
2186,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But what His love could outweigh the whole!
2187,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But most rejoiced in the happy sight
2188,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Of evil conquered and wrong made right.
2189,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2190,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And so from ruin and wreck was born
2191,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The beautiful, flame-hued Indian corn!"
2192,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2193,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2194,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,

2200,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"especially interesting, as being without doubt true in all their"

2202,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"written by St. Leontius, Bishop of Napolis, in Cyprus, who visited"
2203,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Alexandria after the Patriarch’s death, and wrote in great part from the"
2204,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"dictation of the Patriarch’s servant, by name Zaccarias, himself a man"
2205,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,of saintly character.  The stories must have been written by St.

2226,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2227,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To comfort all who suffer,—this alone"
2228,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,His soul desired; for this he prayed and strove

2230,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Too high for pity, nor too low for love."
2231,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2232,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And often was he rich, and often poor;"
2233,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For God upon him had great wealth bestowed,"

2249,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The holy vision that had blessed his youth,"
2250,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And changed, of all his life, the course and plan."
2251,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2252,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""A boy I was, and in my father’s home"
2253,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I slept; ’t was night, and I was all alone,"
2254,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,When to my side I felt a presence come;
2255,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A hand awakened me that touched my own.
2256,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2257,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""I saw the chamber all ablaze with light,"
2258,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And there, before me, stood a lady fair,"
2259,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With olive crowned, and clad in raiment bright,"
2260,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Such as, I think, the saints in Heaven may wear."
2261,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2262,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Hers was no earthly beauty, but a grace"
2263,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Most sweet and solemn that no words can reach;
2264,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"I looked awhile in her celestial face,"
2265,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And then addressed her, but with timid speech:"
2266,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2267,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""’Who art thou, O my lady, that dost bring"
2268,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Such glory in the night?’ Then answered she:
2269,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"’I am the eldest daughter of the King,"
2270,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And more than all my sisters, he loves me."
2271,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2272,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""’For me He left His glory: it was I"
2273,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who led Him on along the thorny road,"
2274,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To suffer, and for others’ sin to die;"
2275,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For me He shared thy sorrow, bore thy load."
2276,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2277,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""’Take me for thy companion: I will be"
2278,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Thy friend as I was His, and by the hand"
2279,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Will lead thee where at evening thou shalt see
2280,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The emperor’s face, and in his presence stand."
2281,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2282,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""While yet the voice was sounding in my ear"
2283,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,The vision ceased; I saw the light no more:
2284,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The moon was shining through the window near,"
2285,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And all the house was silent as before.
2286,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2287,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""And, waiting till I saw the dawn ascend,"
2288,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I lay and mused upon this wondrous thing;
2289,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And tried, with my child’s mind, to comprehend"
2290,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who was the eldest daughter of the King,"
2291,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2292,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""I prayed, I pondered long in vain; until"
2293,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,A light from Heaven was on my spirit shed:
2294,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And not by wisdom, nor by earthly skill,"
2295,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,I knew the meaning of the words she said.
2296,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2297,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""When Christ our blessèd Lord to earth came down,"
2298,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And gave His life for lost and thankless men,"
2299,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And changed His glory for a thorny crown,"
2300,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,’T was Mercy led and did constrain Him then.
2301,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2302,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"""Ah, woe to us, if Mercy had not been"
2303,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"His eldest daughter, and His guide that day!"
2304,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then had we died, and perished in our sin,"
2305,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Unpitied, unforgiven, cast away."""
2306,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2307,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Such was the Patriarch’s story, and we know"
2308,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That Mercy in his heart her dwelling made,"
2309,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,As in no other; and his life below
2310,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Was Mercy, in a thousand forms displayed."
2311,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2312,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And when the summons came that comes to all,"
2313,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,As on a journey distant far he went;
2314,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"While he, rejoicing, heard the heavenly call,"
2315,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,This token to the stricken church was sent.
2316,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2317,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A humble convent had his bounty shared,"
2318,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,From Alexandria some few miles away:
2319,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And there, where he for rest had oft repaired,"
2320,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,An agèd brother sick and dying lay.
2321,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2322,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For years infirm and helpless had he lain,"
2323,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But strong in faith, and happy in God’s will,"
2324,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Through all the weary days and nights of pain,"
2325,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,His only work to suffer and lie still.
2326,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2327,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They two were friends, the Patriarch and he,"
2328,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,For oft the busy saint had loved to turn
2329,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"From care and work, that peaceful face to see,"
2330,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And from those patient lips some lesson learn.
2331,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2332,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And now as he lay dying, glad to go,"
2333,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Yet thinking, maybe, of his absent friend,"
2334,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To him was granted in a dream to know,"
2335,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of that most holy life, the blessèd end."
2336,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2337,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For, sleeping, he beheld in vision clear"
2338,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"That sombre palace by the poor beloved,"
2339,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Where the good Patriarch, year after year,"
2340,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Had all their burdens lightened or removed.
2341,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2342,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And down the stairway moved a long array
2343,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Of priests and others; slowly did they tread,"
2344,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A grave procession, as on festal day,"
2345,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And he, the Patriarch, was at their head."
2346,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2347,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The loved companions of his toil were there,"
2348,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who helped him long to labour and endure,"
2349,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Who knelt beside him in the church at prayer,"
2350,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Or bore his secret bounty to the poor.
2351,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2352,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"They passed the door where none had knocked in vain,"
2353,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They crossed the courtyard with its well of stone;
2354,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,But at the outer gate did all remain
2355,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"With saddened look, while he went forth alone."
2356,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2357,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And now the vision changed, he walked no more"
2358,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The city street that knew his step so well,"
2359,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"But trod a pleasant path, unknown before,"
2360,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Through a fair land, where peace did ever dwell."
2361,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2362,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"There rose the emperor’s palace on a hill,"
2363,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"O’erlooking all the country, where it lay"
2364,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Spread out beneath it, beautiful and still,"
2365,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,In all the sweetness of an April day.
2366,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2367,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Grand was that mansion, stately to behold;"
2368,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"To tell its beauty words can ne’er begin,—"
2369,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The thousand columns, and the domes of gold,"
2370,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And shining all as from a light within.
2371,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2372,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,He neared the palace—of their own accord
2373,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The lofty gates before him open swing,"
2374,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And in the glory, as it outward poured,"
2375,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Came forth the eldest daughter of the King,"
2376,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2377,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Came as he saw her on that far-off night
2378,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Which star-like through his life’s long journey shone,"
2379,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Wearing her olive crown, her robe of light,"
2380,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And came to meet him, where he walked alone,"
2381,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2382,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He bowed and knelt before her, for he knew"
2383,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,That presence which had blessed him long before;
2384,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,While from her folded mantle forth she drew
2385,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"A crown of olive, like the one she wore,"
2386,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2387,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,And placed it on the saintly silvered head;
2388,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Then took his hand.  He rose; nor did they wait:
2389,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"The dreamer watched them as they onward sped,"
2390,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Till, hand in hand, they entered through the gate."
2391,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2392,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And then, as light concealed them, he awoke,"
2393,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And to the brethren, gathered in his cell,"
2394,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In tearful silence listening while he spoke,"
2395,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"He did the story of his vision tell,"
2396,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2397,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"And bade them note what hour the dream was sent,"
2398,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Which some with anxious hearts made haste to do;
2399,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Then waited, fearing what the vision meant;"
2400,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,Till time had shown them all they feared was true.
2401,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2402,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"For when the dreaded tidings came at last,"
2403,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,They knew that on that very hour and day
2404,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"Their much-loved father from this life had passed,"
2405,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,"In his own isle of Cyprus, far away."
2406,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2407,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2408,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2409,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2410,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,*Bishop Troilus*
2411,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2412,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2413,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,*Bishop Troilus*
2414,*THE HIDDEN SERVANTS*,
2415,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*
2416,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2417,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2418,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In pomp and state, with following great, the Bishop Troilus came"
2419,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To the town of Alexandria, which knew him long by fame,"
2420,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To see the holy Patriarch, who had been his friend of old,"
2421,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To hear his words of wisdom, and his saintly life behold."
2422,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In youth their paths together lay, and both with one accord"
2423,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Had chosen then the better part, and thought to serve the Lord;"
2424,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For half a century now and more had each one gone his way.
2425,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"The Patriarch nearer was to God, far nearer than that day;"
2426,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For his soul was like a garden where the flowers that then were
2427,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"sown,"
2428,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With care and patient tending, had to perfect beauty grown."
2429,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2430,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And Troilus? ... In the world’s esteem he stood as high, or"
2431,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,higher;
2432,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"His piety did all men praise, his eloquence admire;"
2433,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He had fiery words to thrill them, he had flowery words to"
2434,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"please,"
2435,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And when he preached on festal days, the people swarmed like"
2436,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,bees;
2437,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,From altar steps to open door there was hardly room to stand.
2438,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And ’t was not the sermon only, but his presence was so grand;"
2439,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With his grave and agèd beauty, with his form erect and tall,"
2440,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With saintly face and silver hair, he won the hearts of all."
2441,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"When through the city he returned, so lofty and serene,"
2442,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"A train of priests attended him, all with obsequious mien;"
2443,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And children followed open-eyed, and gentle ladies bent"
2444,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,From balcony and window high to see him as he went.
2445,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Indeed he was a stately sight in silken raiment clad,"
2446,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,The ring he wore was valued more than aught the Patriarch had;
2447,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the cross upon his bosom, that the people wondering viewed,"
2448,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Gave back the sunshine, when he walked, from jewels many-hued."
2449,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And men said his life was blameless, but it still must be"
2450,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"confessed,"
2451,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Though the saints were glad to own him, yet the sinners loved"
2452,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,him best.
2453,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He was rich, and he was famous, and, as all his life had shown,"
2454,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He was great in worldly wisdom, and the world will love its own."
2455,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2456,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But while saints and shiners praised him, there was one who did"
2457,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"not praise,"
2458,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But whose eyes forever watched him with a sad and anxious gaze;
2459,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For the Patriarch, simple-hearted, was not dazzled like the"
2460,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"rest,"
2461,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And he knew the deadly passion that the Bishop’s soul
2462,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"possessed,—"
2463,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Yes, more deadly than another, for it lay so still and cold,"
2464,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Like a serpent coiled within him,—’twas the growing love of"
2465,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,gold.
2466,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2467,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"It had choked away his pleasure, it had eaten up his peace,"
2468,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,As with every year that left him he had seen his wealth
2469,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"increase,"
2470,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Till his heart grew dry and withered in the smoke of worldly
2471,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,care;
2472,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But it dulled him with its poison, and he knew not it was there."
2473,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Oh, the Patriarch longed to see him from such cruel bondage"
2474,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"free,"
2475,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And he pleaded hard for Troilus every night on bended knee;
2476,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For there yet was time to save him, so he hoped and so believed,"
2477,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But the days and weeks were passing, and no answer he received."
2478,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2479,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But with praying he grew bolder, and to combat he began,"
2480,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And he left his door one morning with a wise and hopeful plan;
2481,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he said in solemn murmur, as he walked along the way,"
2482,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""I must go and fight with Satan for my brother’s soul to-day;"
2483,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He is cruel, he is cunning, but his arts will be in vain,"
2484,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,The strongest net he ever wove will never bear the strain
2485,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Of seeing and of hearing what each day I hear and see,"
2486,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the Lord has saved my brother if he will but come with me."""
2487,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2488,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"It was in the early morning, long before the noise and heat,"
2489,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the life was just beginning in the shady city street,"
2490,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"When he saw a church door open, and he turned and entered in."
2491,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""I will ask the Lord to help me in this work that I begin."""
2492,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2493,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There were some who entered near him, and he saw they came in"
2494,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"haste,"
2495,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Toiling men and burdened women, who had little time to waste;"
2496,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But they stole some precious minutes in that church to kneel and
2497,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"pray,"
2498,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,To refresh their souls and cheer them for the labours of the
2499,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,day;
2500,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And they gathered close around him on the pavement, for they"
2501,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,felt
2502,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,That their prayers would rise the higher if their father with
2503,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,them knelt.
2504,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then he said to them: ""My children, you must help me now indeed,"
2505,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For my heart and soul are troubled for a friend in sorest need;
2506,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He is low with mortal sickness, but no earthly skill can cure."
2507,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Pray the Lord to show His mercy to the poorest of the poor."""
2508,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So they knelt and prayed together, till the morning sun was"
2509,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"high,"
2510,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For the Patriarch’s heart was kindled, and the time went quickly"
2511,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,by.
2512,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2513,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Troilus too had risen early, and had said his morning prayers,"
2514,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But he said them somewhat coldly, being filled with other cares."
2515,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"At that moment he was thinking, while he counted up his store,"
2516,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Upon certain silver goblets he had seen the day before,"
2517,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Which a silversmith had brought him, and had hoped that he would"
2518,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,buy.
2519,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"They were nobly wrought and chiselled, and the price indeed was"
2520,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"high,"
2521,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But he thought upon his table they would look exceeding fine
2522,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"When his friends, the rich and noble, should come in with him to"
2523,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,dine;
2524,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then how all of them would envy, and the thought his spirit"
2525,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"cheered,—"
2526,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"When a gentle knock aroused him, and the Patriarch appeared."
2527,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Very bright his eyes were shining, and his face was all aglow,"
2528,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But his voice was strange and solemn, when he told him, ""I must"
2529,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,go
2530,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To the hospital, my brother, and I came here on my way;"
2531,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"If we both could go together, it would be a happy day."
2532,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There I find my greatest blessing, every morning fresh and new,"
2533,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But far greater, but far sweeter could I share it once with"
2534,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"you."""
2535,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"How the heart of Troilus softened, as those eyes upon him shone,"
2536,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"At their look of earnest pleading, at the tremor in the tone!"
2537,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Strange it was that look could melt him and that voice could
2538,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"change him so,"
2539,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Calling back to life, a moment, what had withered long ago,—"
2540,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Some old good that stirred within him, often spurned and thrust"
2541,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,aside.
2542,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But the flowers the Lord had planted, though they dwindled, had"
2543,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,not died;
2544,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He was poor in heavenly treasure, but he loved the Patriarch"
2545,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,still.
2546,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""I will come,"" he answered quickly; ""you may lead me where you"
2547,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"will."""
2548,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2549,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There were looks and tones of wonder in the hospital that day,"
2550,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"From the rows of low white couches where the sick and dying lay,"
2551,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"As, with all his train about him, in his splendour and his"
2552,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"pride,"
2553,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"On he walked, the Bishop Troilus, by the simple Patriarch’s"
2554,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,side.
2555,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But erelong the two were parted, for as Troilus looked around,"
2556,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,He recoiled in shrinking horror from each doleful sight and
2557,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,sound;
2558,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"While the Patriarch loved to linger for a while by every bed,"
2559,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,With his strong arms ever ready to sustain a drooping head;
2560,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Happy in each humble service, and forgetting all his state,"
2561,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,While he thanked the Lord who sent him on these stricken ones to
2562,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,wait.
2563,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"How the pale sad faces brightened into smiles as he drew near,"
2564,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And what loving words were murmured, faintly murmured in his"
2565,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,ear!
2566,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2567,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Does he well,"" said Bishop Troilus, as he saw him turn and go"
2568,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"From one bedside to another, ""does he well to stoop so low?"""
2569,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Yet had Troilus only known it, they were not the poor alone"
2570,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Whom his brother served that morning, but their Master and his"
2571,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,own.
2572,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There was one but just recovered, light of heart, though poor"
2573,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"and weak,"
2574,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With a journey long before him, going forth his home to seek,"
2575,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Far away among the mountains where his wife and children stayed;
2576,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But the Patriarch’s love had found him ere the stranger sought
2577,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"his aid,"
2578,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Giving money for the journey, giving blessèd words of cheer."
2579,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then he turned, for time was pressing, and a sadder face lay"
2580,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"near,"
2581,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Worn by months of pain and languor; he was young, had once been"
2582,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"strong,"
2583,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He was fading now, but slowly, and perhaps would suffer long,"
2584,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the hundred wants of sickness who can know that has not
2585,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,proved?
2586,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He had wearied all about him, but the Patriarch’s heart was"
2587,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,moved;
2588,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So he heard the long complaining to which no one else gave heed,"
2589,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then he left him, soothed and peaceful, with enough for all his"
2590,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,need.
2591,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So with one and with another for a moment he would stay,"
2592,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"At each bed he left a blessing, and a blessing brought away,"
2593,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Till his purse grew light and empty, as had happened oft before;"
2594,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Though he turned it up and shook it, there was not one penny"
2595,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,more.
2596,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2597,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then he turned and sought for Troilus, who that moment, as it"
2598,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"chanced,"
2599,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With a look subdued and solemn, stood and gazed, like one"
2600,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"entranced,"
2601,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"On the strange, unearthly beauty, on the light of perfect peace"
2602,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In a woman’s face before him; she was nearing her release,"
2603,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And a glory rested on her from the opening door above;
2604,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Yet one shadow marred its splendour when she looked with anxious
2605,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,love
2606,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"On a little maid, her daughter, with a pretty, careworn face,"
2607,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Who had brought two younger children, waiting now for her"
2608,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"embrace,"
2609,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Wondering why she did not give it, why so deadly still she lay,"
2610,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For they knew not, though she knew it, she would not live out"
2611,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,the day.
2612,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Said the Patriarch: ""Brother Troilus, have you nothing you could"
2613,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,give
2614,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To this woman and her children, for she has not long to live?"
2615,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And I see her mind is troubled, and I think, before they part,"
2616,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Had she something she could leave them, it would ease her"
2617,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,burdened heart;
2618,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For myself, I freely promise I will make these babes my care,"
2619,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But to-day my purse is empty, so I pray you not to spare."""
2620,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2621,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Oh! alas, poor Bishop Troilus! how this pleading broke the spell"
2622,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"That the woman’s look had woven, and how low his spirit fell!"
2623,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For he dearly loved his money, with a passion deep and blind,"
2624,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"As a scholar loves his learning, or a saint his peace of mind."
2625,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But the eyes of all were on him at that moment, and he knew"
2626,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,’T was in hopeful expectation of what such a saint would do;
2627,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There were many who had entered from the busy street to gaze,"
2628,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He would not be shamed before them, they should still have cause"
2629,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,to praise;
2630,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But his purse would have to open, so he turned and waved his"
2631,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,hand
2632,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To the priest who always bore it, with a gesture of command."
2633,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""For this woman for her daughter and the two poor babes,"" said"
2634,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"he,"
2635,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Lay down thirty golden pieces in the Patriarch’s hand for me."""
2636,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2637,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There were none who had not heard him, for his voice was loud"
2638,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"and clear,"
2639,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And a low, admiring murmur rose from all the couches near,"
2640,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,While the Patriarch stood rejoicing in the deed his friend had
2641,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,done;
2642,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"By himself he judged another, and he thought the victory won."
2643,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For one moment Bishop Troilus feels his narrow heart expand,"
2644,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"When the maiden thanks him weeping, and the children kiss his"
2645,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"hand,"
2646,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the mother, just departing, from the pillow where she lies,"
2647,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Turns one happy smile upon him, with a blessing in her eyes."
2648,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2649,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But alas! on home returning, when the sacrifice was made,"
2650,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"When the Patriarch’s holy presence was no longer there to aid,"
2651,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He did much bewail his money; half in anger, half in pain,"
2652,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,To have parted in a moment with what took so long to gain.
2653,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And his heart was in a turmoil, and a pain was in his head,"
2654,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Till the raging turned to fever, and he threw him on his bed"
2655,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,In a storm of angry passion that no reason could control;
2656,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For to him to part with money was like parting with his soul.
2657,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But he said no word to any of this rage and inward strife,"
2658,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the priests who waited on him were in terror for his life,"
2659,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And as nothing made him better, they took counsel, and agreed"
2660,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"That the Patriarch, and he only, was the man to meet their need;"
2661,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,So they sent and humbly prayed him if to come he would be
2662,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"pleased,"
2663,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For his friend the Bishop Troilus was with sudden illness
2664,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,seized.
2665,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2666,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In his chamber lay the Bishop, sick in body, sick in mind;"
2667,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But the Patriarch, wise in spirit, had his malady divined."
2668,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So he came and sat beside him, patient still, but pale with"
2669,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"grief,"
2670,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,While he made one last endeavour for that troubled soul’s
2671,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,relief.
2672,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But his friend was sore and angry, and his words he would not"
2673,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"hear,"
2674,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For the presence now disturbed him that had lately been so dear.
2675,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he lay with face averted, till he heard the Patriarch say,"
2676,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""I have brought you back the money that you gave away to-day."""
2677,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then indeed he started wildly, and his eyes he opened wide,"
2678,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And he turned and faced his brother with a joy he could not
2679,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,hide;
2680,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For with sudden hope he trembled, and it paled his fevered"
2681,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,cheek;
2682,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the Patriarch’s heart was sinking, but he still went on to"
2683,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,speak:
2684,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""When I asked your help this morning, I had nothing of my own,"
2685,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,So I left to you the blessing which had else been mine alone;
2686,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For those three dear orphan children I had gladly done the
2687,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"whole,"
2688,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,So their mother up in heaven might be praying for my soul.
2689,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And I now have come to ask you if this grace you will resign,—"
2690,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Will you take again the money, and let your good deed be mine?"
2691,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Yet I pray you to consider, ere you grant it or refuse,"
2692,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,What a great and heavenly treasure I shall win and you will
2693,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,lose;
2694,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For indeed I would not wrong you, though to me the gain be"
2695,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,great.
2696,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So then do not answer rashly,—there is time, we both can wait,"
2697,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And ’t were well to think a little on the words our Master said,"
2698,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"How He left the poor behind, that we might serve them in His"
2699,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,stead;
2700,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And whatever help we grant them, be it great or be it small,"
2701,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To our blessèd Lord we give it, to our Lord, who gave us all."""
2702,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2703,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then made answer Bishop Troilus, ""As for what you now propose,"
2704,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"If it please you I am ready, and the bargain we can close."
2705,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There are many kinds of service, and each needful in its way,"
2706,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And I think the Lord has set me in His church to preach and
2707,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"pray,"
2708,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And to save the souls that perish, and to teach men how to live,"
2709,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"While your own vocation, brother, is with open hand to give."
2710,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Let not one defraud the other, take your part and leave me mine,"
2711,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For however we may divide it, all the service is divine."
2712,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Let us feed God’s flock together, for His needy children care,"
2713,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"I the souls, and you the bodies, so the burden we may share."""
2714,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Then so be it,"" said the other, but his voice was low and"
2715,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"grave,"
2716,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And he prayed to God in silence for the soul he could not save.
2717,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""We must write it all in order, we must sign and seal it too,"
2718,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So that mine may be the blessing, while the gold remains with"
2719,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"you."""
2720,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2721,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So they wrote a contract solemn, to which each one signed his"
2722,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"name,"
2723,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In which he, the Bishop Troilus, did relinquish every claim"
2724,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To whatever reward or merit his one pious deed had earned,"
2725,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Since the thirty golden pieces to his hand had been returned.
2726,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then the Patriarch counted slowly all the pieces, one by one,"
2727,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In the open hand of Troilus, and his last attempt was done."
2728,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"All had failed, and heavy-hearted from that chamber forth he"
2729,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"went,"
2730,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,While his friend lay still and smiling in the fullness of
2731,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,content;
2732,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For the fever now had left him, and ’t was sweet to lie and"
2733,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"rest,"
2734,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With no more a thorn to vex him in his smooth, untroubled"
2735,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,breast.
2736,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,With a dreamy satisfaction he was thinking all the while
2737,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,How those pretty shining pieces would increase the golden pile
2738,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,In that chest of hoarded treasure that already held so much;
2739,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And he laid his hand upon them with a fond caressing touch.
2740,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But his thoughts began to wander, and his eyes were closing"
2741,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"soon,"
2742,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,In the drowsy heat and stillness of the summer afternoon.
2743,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2744,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then a dream was sent to bless him, as in quiet sleep he lay,"
2745,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And it bore him in a vision to the country far away;
2746,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he saw the holy city, where the saints and angels dwell;"
2747,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Of its glory, of its beauty, mortal tongue can never tell."
2748,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There were palm-trees growing stately by the water, crystal"
2749,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,clear;
2750,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There was music ever swelling, sometimes far and sometimes near,"
2751,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,As it rose in mystic cadence from the hearts that overflowed
2752,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,With the joy that reigns forever in their beautiful abode.
2753,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the people of that city whom he met along the way
2754,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"On the shining golden pavement, oh, how full of peace were they!"
2755,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For he thought some heavenly vision shone forever in their
2756,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"sight,"
2757,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he looked where they were gazing, but he only saw the light"
2758,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"As it flooded all with glory, and the air it seemed to fill;"
2759,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But he saw not what they looked on, for his eyes were mortal"
2760,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,still.
2761,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Now among those lighted faces there were some he knew before,"
2762,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Of the poor to whom so often he had closed his heart and door;
2763,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Such as in the heavenly city he had little thought to find,"
2764,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For the sad and sick and needy had been never to his mind:
2765,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Of the rich were not so many, yet a few of these beside,"
2766,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Who by deeds of love and mercy had their Master glorified.
2767,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And in perfect health and beauty, among all that bright array,"
2768,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Was the woman he saw dying in the hospital that day.
2769,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2770,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"All along the road he travelled, to the left and to the right,"
2771,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Rose the palaces they dwelt in, each a mansion of delight,"
2772,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But all varying in their beauty, far away as eye could reach,"
2773,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With a name in golden letters, high above the door of each."
2774,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And sweet faces smiled upon him, from the windows here and"
2775,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"there,"
2776,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Gentle faces free forever from the shade of earthly care;
2777,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And he heard the happy voices of the children as they played
2778,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In the fair and peaceful gardens, where the roses never fade;"
2779,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the things he left behind him seemed so very poor and small,"
2780,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"That he wondered, in that glory, why men cared for them at all."
2781,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2782,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But oh, wonder of all wonders, when he saw a name that shone"
2783,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"O’er a high and arching doorway, yes, a name that was his own!"
2784,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Could it be his eyes deceived him?  No, he read it o’er and"
2785,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,o’er;
2786,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""This,"" it said, ""of Bishop Troilus is the home forevermore."""
2787,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Oh the beauty of that palace, with such light and splendour"
2788,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"filled,"
2789,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,That he thought the clouds of sunset had been hewn its walls to
2790,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,gild;
2791,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the golden door stood open, he could catch a glimpse within"
2792,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Of the vast illumined chambers where no foot had ever been.
2793,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He could only gaze bewildered, for the wonder was too great,"
2794,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the joy so poured upon him he could hardly bear the weight.
2795,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then he took one step toward it, but a servant of the King"
2796,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Who from far-off earth that morning had returned on busy wing,"
2797,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And was bearing gifts and tokens from the scattered church
2798,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"below,"
2799,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Came and passed and stood before him, in the courtyard’s golden"
2800,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,glow.
2801,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2802,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then he turned to his companions, for a few had gathered near,"
2803,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And his words fell hard and heavy on the Bishop’s listening
2804,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"ear,—"
2805,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""We must cancel that inscription from the stone, and write"
2806,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,thereon
2807,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"That Troilus hath this palace sold unto the Patriarch John,"
2808,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And that thirty golden pieces were the price that he received."""
2809,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Up then started Bishop Troilus, for his soul was sorely grieved,"
2810,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he tried to speak, but could not, and awoke in his dismay,"
2811,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,With his hand upon the money close beside him where he lay.
2812,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2813,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Now the long bright day was over; as he saw the sun descend,—"
2814,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Weary day,"" the Patriarch thought it; he was glad to see it"
2815,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,end.
2816,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He was walking in his garden where the freshening shadows lay,"
2817,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the flowers that drooped at noontime stood erect in beauty
2818,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,gay;
2819,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But their brightness could not cheer him, and he bent his head"
2820,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"and sighed,"
2821,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For he thought, with wondering sadness, that the Lord his prayer"
2822,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"denied,"
2823,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2824,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then he heard a step behind him, and he looked; but who was"
2825,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"there,"
2826,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Wild of look, like one who struggled with a pain he could not"
2827,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,bear?
2828,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Could it be the stately Bishop?  Yes, but oh, how changed to"
2829,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,see!
2830,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he said with tears and trembling, ""O my brother, pray for"
2831,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"me!"""
2832,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,How the Patriarch’s heart rebounded from the weight that on it
2833,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"pressed,"
2834,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"At the change so deep and sudden, in those broken words"
2835,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,expressed!
2836,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"How his cheek grew red with gladness, how it smoothed his"
2837,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,troubled brow!
2838,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""God forgive me if I doubted, all my prayers are answered now."""
2839,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2840,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Come,"" he said, ""my brother Troilus, sit beside me, tell me"
2841,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"all;"""
2842,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he led him, pale and helpless, to a seat beside the wall."
2843,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And there Troilus, clinging closely to that strong and helpful"
2844,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"hand,"
2845,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Trusting in the heart that loved him and his thoughts could
2846,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"understand,"
2847,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Told the story of his vision to his awed and listening friend,—"
2848,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"All that dream of light and glory, with its sad, unlooked-for"
2849,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,end:
2850,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But his voice, which trembled ever, wellnigh failed him when he"
2851,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,told
2852,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Of the horror of that waking, with his hand upon the gold;"
2853,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"When his eyes, long blind, were opened, and he saw the wreck"
2854,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"within,"
2855,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And one fearful moment, showed him what his wasted life had"
2856,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,been.
2857,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Now,"" he said, ""my courage fails me when I think to mend my"
2858,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,ways.
2859,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"I have wasted all God gave me,—mind, and strength, and length of"
2860,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"days,—"
2861,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the gold I gave my soul for pulls me downward with its
2862,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,weight;
2863,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Help me if you can, oh, help me!  Say it is not yet too late."""
2864,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he looked with eyes beseeching at the Patriarch, who replied"
2865,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,With a smile that fell like sunshine on the faint heart by his
2866,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"side,—"
2867,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2868,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""What! too late for God’s forgiveness, when He calls you to"
2869,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,repent?
2870,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T was to save you, not to lose you, that the blessèd dream was"
2871,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,sent;
2872,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T is His help, not mine, my brother, you are needing, and you"
2873,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"know,"
2874,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"If we ask it, He will give it, for Himself has told us so."
2875,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the prodigal returning shall be welcomed all the more
2876,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,If the years were long and many since he left his Father’s
2877,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"door."""
2878,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""But,"" said Troilus, ""I am agèd, and my manhood’s strength is"
2879,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,past;
2880,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"After such a life ungodly, can I hope for grace at last?"""
2881,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Never fear,"" the Patriarch answered, ""there is joy in heaven"
2882,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"to-day,"
2883,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And they ask not in their gladness if your hair be black or
2884,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"gray."""
2885,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2886,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So then Troilus gathered courage, and that night, by deed and"
2887,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"word,"
2888,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Gave himself and all his substance to the service of the Lord;
2889,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Yet in his own strength mistrusting, he implored his friend anew"
2890,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With his daily prayer to aid him, and he promised so to do."
2891,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the thirty golden pieces he returned to him again,"
2892,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Yes, and other thirty with them, for the change was not in vain,"
2893,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2894,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then he left the past behind him, and a better life began;"
2895,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,From that evening in the garden he became another man.
2896,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,There was no more train about him when he walked the city
2897,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"through,"
2898,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For the priests who once attended now had better work to do;
2899,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the ladies cared no longer from their balconies to lean,"
2900,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,When of worldly pomp and splendour there was nothing to be seen.
2901,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For the cross of many jewels on his bosom shone no more,"
2902,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Having gone on works of mercy to increase his heavenly store.
2903,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But the poor and needy sought him; he was now their faithful
2904,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"friend,"
2905,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And they knew, whatever befell them, on his love they might"
2906,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,depend.
2907,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2908,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So his closing days were happy, after years of sordid care,"
2909,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For no gain can bring contentment till the poor have had their
2910,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,share;
2911,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he lightened many a burden, and he righted many a wrong,"
2912,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the wealth became a blessing that had been a curse so long;
2913,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And his secret hoard was scattered, and men said that he died"
2914,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"poor,"

2923,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"This beautiful legend has for me a most peculiar interest, owing to the"
2924,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,circumstances under which I first heard it.  It was taught to me by a
2925,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,very dear young friend whom I had known and loved from his
2926,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"infancy,—Piero, the only surviving child of Count Giuseppe Pasolini"
2927,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Zanelli of Faenza.  It was only last October—eight months ago—and we
2928,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,were all staying together in the home of his beloved and still beautiful
2929,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"grandmother, at Bassano, in the Veneto.  It was the last evening that we"
2930,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"expected to pass together, and Pierino (we had never been able to give"
2931,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"up calling him by that childish diminutive) brought a book with him, a"
2932,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"collection of popular legends compiled by De Gubernatis, and said that"
2933,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"he had a story to read us.  It was ""The Crosses on the Wall,"" and it has"
2934,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,always seemed to me as though he read it on that particular evening to
2935,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,prepare us for what was to come.  For some months he had been not quite
2936,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"so strong as usual, yet no one felt any particular apprehension, until"
2937,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"on the twenty-eighth of November he died, almost without warning. He was"
2938,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"twenty-two years old, of a very beautiful character,—so good that we"
2939,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,ought to have known he was not for us.
2940,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2941,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With him two great and ancient families come to an end,—the"
2942,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Pasolini-Zanelli of Faenza, and the Baroni-Semitecolo of Bassano: these"
2943,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,last are the only descendants of that Semitecolo who worked in mosaic at
2944,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Torcello.

2951,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2952,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Come, children, listen to what I tell,"
2953,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For my words are wise to-day:
2954,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,From Primiero among the hills
2955,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Was the legend brought away.
2956,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2957,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And Primiero among the hills
2958,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Is a little world apart,"
2959,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Where is much to love and much to learn,"
2960,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,If you have a willing heart.
2961,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2962,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"It lies on high, like a stranded ship,"
2963,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,From the parted wave of time;
2964,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Not far from the troubled world we know,"
2965,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But the way is hard to climb.
2966,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2967,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For the mountains rise and close it in,"
2968,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,With their walls of green and gray;
2969,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With crag and forest and smooth-worn cliff,"
2970,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Where the clouds alone can stray.
2971,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2972,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And when a house they have builded there,"
2973,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"If a blessing they would win,"
2974,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Above the door do they write a prayer,"
2975,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,That Christ may dwell therein.
2976,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2977,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And I think, throughout the ancient town,"
2978,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"On its steep ascending road,"
2979,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In many a heart, in many a home,"
2980,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Has He taken His abode.
2981,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2982,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And when a burden is hard to bear—
2983,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And such burdens come to all—
2984,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"They tell the story I ’m telling now,"
2985,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Of the crosses on the wall.
2986,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2987,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T is a pearl of wisdom, gathered far"
2988,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,In the dim and distant past;
2989,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But ever needed, but ever new,"
2990,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,As long as the world shall last.
2991,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2992,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For never has been since earth was made,"
2993,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And surely shall never be,"
2994,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"A man so happy or wise or great,"
2995,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,He might from the cross be free.
2996,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
2997,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"The tale it is of a widow poor,"
2998,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And by trouble sorely pressed;
2999,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Of how, through sorrow and many tears,"
3000,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,At the end her soul was blest.
3001,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3002,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She had not been always poor and sad,"
3003,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For her early years were bright,"
3004,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With a happy home, and with parents kind,"
3005,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And herself their hearts’ delight!
3006,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3007,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"A mother’s darling, a father’s pride,"
3008,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,She was fair in form and face;
3009,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"A sunny creature, a joy to all,"
3010,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For her sweet and winning grace.
3011,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3012,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then, early married to one she loved,"
3013,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,She had still been shielded well;
3014,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For her he laboured, for her he thought,"
3015,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And on her no burden fell.
3016,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3017,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She worked, indeed; but what work was hers"
3018,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Through the short and happy hours?
3019,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To pluck the fruit from her orchard trees,"
3020,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Or to tend the garden flowers;
3021,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3022,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To sit and spin, and to sing the while"
3023,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,In her porch with roses gay;
3024,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To spread the table with plenty piled,"
3025,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And to watch the children play.
3026,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3027,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Their home was a little nest of peace;
3028,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T was a mile beyond the town,"
3029,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In that sheltered valley, green with woods,"
3030,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Where the river murmurs down.
3031,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3032,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And she never dreamed of change to come,"
3033,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"(Though a change must all expect,)"
3034,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Till the blow, like lightning, on her fell,"
3035,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And her happy life was wrecked.
3036,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3037,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But who could have thought the man would die?
3038,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,There were few so strong as he!
3039,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"From his forest work they bore him home,"
3040,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Struck dead by a falling tree.
3041,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3042,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"A petted child, and a wife beloved,"
3043,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She had hardly sorrow known,"
3044,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Till the strong, brave man was borne away,"
3045,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she faced the world alone.
3046,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3047,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Alone, with a babe too young to speak,"
3048,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And with other children five:
3049,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Oh, why,"" she asked, ""are the strong removed"
3050,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the feeble left alive?"""
3051,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3052,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But where is the good of asking
3053,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,When our helpers disappear?
3054,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"That question never was answered yet,"
3055,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And it never will be, here."
3056,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3057,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,There was little time to sit and weep;
3058,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She must rise, and bear the strain;"
3059,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Alone she stood, with the home to keep,"
3060,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the children’s bread to gain.
3061,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3062,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,The best of herself had gone with him;
3063,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,She had no more faith nor trust:
3064,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She could not bow to the Lord’s decree,"
3065,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For she felt it all unjust.
3066,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3067,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"The good Lord cares for a widow’s need,"
3068,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But on Him she did not call.
3069,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She laboured hard, and she fought with fate,"
3070,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And they lived—but that was all.
3071,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3072,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She fought her battle with fate, and failed,"
3073,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,As many have failed before;
3074,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"If against the thorns we push and press,"
3075,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,They will only prick the more.
3076,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3077,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She could not bear with the children now,"
3078,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she called them rude and wild;
3079,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Forgetting quite, in her sullen grief,"
3080,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,That she had been once a child.
3081,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3082,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Yes, wild they were; and like all wild things"
3083,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,They were light and swift and strong;
3084,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And her poor, sick spirit turned away"
3085,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"From the gay, unruly throng."
3086,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3087,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"They swam the river, they climbed the trees,"
3088,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,They were full of life and play;
3089,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But oft, when their mother’s voice they heard,"
3090,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,They hid from her sight away.
3091,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3092,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"They did not love her, and that she knew,"
3093,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And of that she oft complained;
3094,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But not by threats nor by angry words
3095,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Could the children’s love be gained.
3096,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3097,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Respect and honour we may command;
3098,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,They will come at duty’s call:
3099,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But love, the beautiful thornless rose,"
3100,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Grows wild, when it grows at all."
3101,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3102,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And she grew bitter, as time went on,"
3103,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Grew bitter and hard and sore.
3104,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Till one day she cried in her despair,"
3105,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""I can bear my life no more!"
3106,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3107,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Look down from Heaven, good Lord, and see"
3108,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And pity my cruel fate!
3109,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Oh, come, and in mercy take away"
3110,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"My burden, for ’t is too great!"
3111,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3112,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""My heart is breaking with all its load,"
3113,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And I feel my life decline;
3114,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Never I think did the woman live
3115,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Who has borne a cross like mine!"""
3116,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3117,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To her cry for help an answer came,"
3118,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And solemn it was, and strange!"
3119,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For a silence deep around her fell,"
3120,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the place seemed all to change.
3121,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3122,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She stood in a sad and sombre room,"
3123,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Where from ceiling down to floor,"
3124,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Along the wall and on every side,"
3125,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,There were crosses—nothing more.
3126,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3127,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There were crosses old, and crosses new,"
3128,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,There were crosses large and small;
3129,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And in their midst there was One who stood
3130,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,As the Master of them all.
3131,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3132,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Before His presence her eyes dropped low,"
3133,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And her wild complaining died;
3134,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For she knew the cross that He had borne
3135,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Was greater than all beside.
3136,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3137,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And He bade her choose, and take away,"
3138,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"From among the many there,"
3139,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Another cross, in exchange for hers,"
3140,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,That she found too great to bear.
3141,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3142,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She looked for those that were least in size,"
3143,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she quickly lifted one;
3144,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But oh, ’t was heavy, and pained her more"
3145,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Than her own had ever done!
3146,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3147,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,She laid it back with a trembling hand—
3148,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""And whose cross is that?"" she cried;"
3149,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""For heavier ’t is than even mine!"""
3150,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And a solemn voice replied:
3151,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3152,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""That cross belongs to a maiden young,"
3153,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But of youth she little knows;
3154,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For the days to her are days of pain,"
3155,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the night brings scant repose.
3156,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3157,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""A helpless, suffering, useless thing!"
3158,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And her pain will never cease,"
3159,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Till death in pity will come one day,"
3160,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And her troubles end in peace.
3161,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3162,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""She never has walked the pleasant fields,"
3163,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Nor has sat beneath the trees;
3164,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,The hospital wall that shuts her in
3165,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Is the only world she sees.
3166,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3167,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""She has no mother, she has no home,"
3168,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And in strangers’ hands she lies;
3169,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With none to care for her while she lives,"
3170,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Nor weep for her when she dies."""
3171,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3172,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""But why is the cross so small, my Lord,"
3173,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And why does her heart not break?"""
3174,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""She counts it little,"" the answer came,"
3175,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""For she bears it for my sake."""
3176,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3177,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,The widow blushed with a sudden shame;
3178,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,To her eyes the tears arose:
3179,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She dried them soon, and again she turned,"
3180,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And another cross she chose.
3181,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3182,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"It fell from her hand against the wall,"
3183,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she let it there remain:
3184,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""That cross shall never be mine,"" she said,"
3185,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Though I take my own again!"
3186,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3187,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""And whose is this that I cannot hold?"
3188,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For it seems to burn my hand!
3189,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And never, I think, was heart so strong"
3190,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"That could such a weight withstand."""
3191,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3192,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""The cross it is of a gentle wife,"
3193,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she wears it all unseen;
3194,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With early sorrow her hair is white,"
3195,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But she keeps a smile serene.
3196,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3197,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""She gave her heart to an evil man,"
3198,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she thought him good and true;
3199,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And long she trusted and long believed,"
3200,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But at last the truth she knew.
3201,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3202,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""She knows that his soul is stained with crime,"
3203,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But the worst she still conceals;
3204,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Abuse and terror her sole reward,"
3205,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the Lord knows what she feels!
3206,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3207,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""She cannot leave him, for love dies hard,"
3208,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And her children bear his name;
3209,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But she prays for grace, to keep and guard"
3210,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Their innocent lives from shame.
3211,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3212,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""She trembles oft when his step she hears"
3213,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,On a lonely winter night;
3214,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she hides her frightened babes afar
3215,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,From their cruel father’s sight.
3216,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3217,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""And she dares not even hope for death,"
3218,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Though his hand might set her free:
3219,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,’T were well for her in the grave to rest;
3220,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But where would the children be?"""
3221,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3222,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"The widow shuddered, her face grew pale,"
3223,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she no more turned to look:
3224,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She reached her hand to the wall near by,"
3225,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And a cross by chance she took.
3226,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3227,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T was not so large as the first had been,"
3228,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But it seemed a fearful weight!
3229,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""And whose am I holding now?"" she asked,"
3230,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For it did not look so great.
3231,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3232,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""A mother’s cross is the one you bear,"""
3233,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So the voice in answer said,"
3234,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""And she once had children six like you;"
3235,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But her children all are dead.
3236,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3237,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""She has all besides that earth can give;"
3238,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She has friends and wealth to spare,"
3239,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And house and land—but she counts them not,"

3242,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Time passes slowly, and she grows old;"
3243,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But she may not yet depart.
3244,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In lonely splendour she counts the years,"
3245,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With an empty, hungry heart."
3246,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3247,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""And she knows by whom the cross was sent,"
3248,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she tries her head to bow;
3249,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But six green mounds by the churchyard wall
3250,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Are the most she cares for now."""
3251,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3252,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"The widow thought of her own wild brood,"
3253,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she felt a creeping chill:
3254,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And, ""Oh, give me back my cross!"" she said,"
3255,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""I will keep and bear it still."
3256,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3257,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Forgive me, Lord"" (and with that she knelt,"
3258,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And for very shame she wept).
3259,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""I know my sin, that I could not bow,"
3260,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Nor Thy holy will accept.
3261,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3262,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""Oh, give me patience, for life is hard;"
3263,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the daily strength I need!
3264,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And by Thy grace I will try to bear
3265,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,The burden for me decreed.
3266,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3267,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""I’ll change my ways with the children now,"
3268,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Though they give me added cares.
3269,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Poor babes!  I know, if they love me not,"
3270,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"That the blame is mine, not theirs!"""
3271,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3272,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She kept her word as the weeks went on,"
3273,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she fought with fate no more:
3274,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T was now with a patient, humble heart"
3275,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,That her daily cross she bore.
3276,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3277,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,The children wondered to see her change
3278,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,So greatly in look and speech!
3279,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She met them now with a smile so kind,"
3280,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And a gentle word for each.
3281,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3282,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And soon they learned, from her altered ways,"
3283,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,What her words had vainly taught;
3284,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Their love, that long she had claimed in vain,"
3285,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Came back to her all unsought.
3286,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3287,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There were merry shouts and dancing feet,"
3288,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,When the mother came in sight;
3289,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There were little arms around her thrown,"
3290,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,There were eyes with joy alight.
3291,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3292,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With love for teacher, they learned to help,"
3293,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,There was work for fingers small:
3294,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Her heart grew soft like the earth in spring,"
3295,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she thanked the Lord for all!
3296,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3297,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Her girls so pretty, her boys so brave,"
3298,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And so helpful all and kind!
3299,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She wondered often, and thought with shame"
3300,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Of how she had once repined.
3301,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3302,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For in their presence she oft forgot
3303,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Her burden of want and care,"
3304,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Forgot her trouble—forgot, almost,"
3305,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,That she had a cross to bear!
3306,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3307,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3308,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3309,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3310,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,*Suora Marianna*
3311,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3312,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3313,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,*Suora Marianna*
3314,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3315,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3316,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Little children, will you listen to a simple tale of mine,"
3317,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"That I learned at San Marcello, in the Tuscan Apennine,"
3318,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"From an agèd, saintly woman, gone to heaven long ago?"
3319,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"It has helped me on my journey, and as yet you cannot know"
3320,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Half the wisdom stored within it, nor the comfort it can give;"
3321,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But still, try and not forget it!  You will need it if you live,"
3322,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And some day, when life is waning and your hands begin to tire,"
3323,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"You will think of Marianna, and her vision by the fire."
3324,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3325,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In a convent, old and quiet, near a little country town,"
3326,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"On a chestnut-shaded hillside, to the river sloping down,"
3327,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Dwelt a few of those good sisters who go out among the poor,"
3328,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Who must labour late and early, and much weariness endure;"
3329,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the one who did in patience and in all good works excel
3330,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Was the Sister Marianna, she whose story now I tell."
3331,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3332,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She was ever kind and willing, for each heavy task prepared:"
3333,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"No one ever thought to spare her, and herself she never spared."
3334,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"All unpraised and all unnoticed, bearing burdens not her own,"
3335,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Yet she lived as rich and happy as a queen upon her throne!
3336,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3337,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She was rich, though few would think it; for God gave her grace"
3338,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"to choose,"
3339,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Not the world’s deceitful riches, but the wealth one cannot"
3340,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,lose.
3341,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There are many heap up treasure, but it is not every one"
3342,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Who will take his treasure with him when his earthly life is
3343,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,done.
3344,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3345,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Was she beautiful?  I know not.  She had eyes of peaceful light,"
3346,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And her face looked sweet and blooming in its frame of linen
3347,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,white.
3348,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"To the sick and heavy-hearted she was pleasant to behold,"
3349,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And she seemed a heavenly vision to the feeble and the old.
3350,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She was happy when she wandered up the wandering mountain road,"
3351,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Bearing food and warmth and blessing to some desolate abode,"
3352,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Though the ice-cold winds were blowing and her woman’s strength
3353,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,was tried;
3354,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For she knew who walked there with her, in her heart and by her"
3355,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,side.
3356,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She was happy—oh, so happy!—in her little whitewashed cell"
3357,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Looking out among the branches, where they gave her leave to"
3358,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,dwell
3359,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In her scanty hours of leisure; for there, looking from the"
3360,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"wall,"
3361,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Were the dear and holy faces that she loved the best of all.
3362,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3363,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T was an old and faded picture, poorly painted at the best,"
3364,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Of Our Lord, the Holy Infant, in His Mother’s arms at rest."
3365,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But her faith and loving fancy had a glory to it lent,"
3366,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the faces that she saw there were not what the artist meant
3367,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the wooden shelf before it she would often-times adorn
3368,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With the buttercup and bluebell, and the wild rose from the"
3369,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"thorn,"
3370,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Which she gathered, when returning, while the morning dew was"
3371,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"bright,"
3372,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"From some home, remote and lonely, where she watched the sick by"
3373,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,night.
3374,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So her life was full of sunshine, for in toiling for the Lord"
3375,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,She had found the hidden sweetness that in common things lies
3376,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,stored:
3377,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"He has strewn the earth with flowers, and each eye their"
3378,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,brightness sees;
3379,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But He filled their cups with honey, for His humble working"
3380,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,bees.
3381,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3382,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But there came a time—poor sister!—when her rosy cheek grew
3383,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"pale,"
3384,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And her eyes, with all their sunlight, seemed to smile as"
3385,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,through a veil;
3386,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And her step was weak and heavy, as she trod the steep ascent,"
3387,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Where through weeks of wintry weather to her loving work she
3388,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,went.
3389,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T was a foot-path, lone and narrow, winding up among the trees,"
3390,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And ’t was hard to trace in winter, when the slippery ground"
3391,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"would freeze,"
3392,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the snow fall thick above it, hiding every sign and mark;"
3393,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But she went that way so often she could climb it in the dark!
3394,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T was to nurse a poor young mother, by fierce malady assailed,"
3395,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"That she made the daily journey, and she never once had failed."
3396,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Now the short sharp days were over, and the spring had just"
3397,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,begun;
3398,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Every morn the light came sooner, and more strength was in the"
3399,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,sun.
3400,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3401,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"All around the grass was springing, and its tender verdure"
3402,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"spread,"
3403,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Mid the empty burrs of chestnuts, and the old leaves, brown and"
3404,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"dead,"
3405,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Low and small, but creeping, creeping till it almost touched the"
3406,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,edge
3407,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Of the daily lessening snow-drifts, under rock or thorny hedge."
3408,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"From the wreck of last year’s autumn life awakened, strong and"
3409,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"new,"
3410,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the buds were crowding upward, though as yet the flowers"
3411,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,were few.
3412,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3413,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Many nights had she been watching, and with little rest by day,"
3414,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,For her heart was in the chamber where that helpless woman lay;
3415,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"There the flame of life she cherished, when it almost ceased to"
3416,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"burn,"
3417,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Praying God to help and keep them till the husband should
3418,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,return.
3419,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3420,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T was the old and common story, such as all of us can hear,"
3421,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"If we care to, in the mountains, every day throughout the year!"
3422,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She who languished, weak and wasting, in the garret chamber"
3423,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"there,"
3424,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,Had been once as strong and happy as the wild birds in the air.
3425,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"She had been a country beauty, for the boys to serenade;"
3426,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And the poets sang about her, in the simple rhymes they made,"
3427,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And with glowing words compared her to the lilies as they grew,"
3428,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Or to stars, or budding roses, as their manner is to do."
3429,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then the man who played at weddings with his ancient violin,"
3430,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With his sad, impassioned singing, had contrived her heart to"
3431,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,win;
3432,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And one brilliant April morning he had brought her home, a"
3433,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"bride,"
3434,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,To his farm and low-built cottage on the mountain’s terraced
3435,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,side.
3436,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"’T was a poor, rough home to look at, and from neighbours far"
3437,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"away,"
3438,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,But with love and health and music there was much to make it
3439,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,gay.
3440,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"They were happy, careless people, and they thought not to"
3441,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"complain,"
3442,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Though the door were cracked and broken, or the roof let in the"
3443,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,rain:
3444,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"They could pile the fire with branches, while the winter storms"
3445,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,swept by;
3446,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3447,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"For the rest, their life was mostly out beneath the open sky."
3448,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Time had come, and brought its changes,—sunshine first, and then"
3449,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"the shade,"
3450,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Frost untimely, chestnuts blighted.  Sickness came, and debts"
3451,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,were made;
3452,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Fields were sold, alas, to pay them; yet their troubles did not"
3453,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"cease,"
3454,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,And the poor man’s heart was troubled thus to see his land
3455,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,decrease!
3456,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Fields were gone, and bread was wanting, for there now were"
3457,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,children small;
3458,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Much he loved them, much he laboured—but he could not feed them"
3459,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,all.
3460,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3461,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"So he left them, heavy-hearted, and his fortune went to try"
3462,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"In the low Maremma country, where men gain or where they die,"
3463,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"With its soft and treacherous beauty, with its fever-laden air;"
3464,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"But as yet the fever spared him, and they hoped it yet would"
3465,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,spare.
3466,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,’T was a long and cruel winter in the home he left behind:
3467,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Lonely felt the house without him, and the young wife moped and"
3468,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,pined:
3469,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Still her children’s love sustained her, till this sickness laid"
3470,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,her low;
3471,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"When good Sister Marianna came to nurse her, as you know."
3472,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3473,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Week on week had hope been waning, as more feeble still she"
3474,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,grew:
3475,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Marianna tried, but vainly, every simple cure she knew."
3476,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Then the doctor gave up hoping, and his long attendance ceased:"
3477,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"""I can do no more,"" he told her; ""you had better call the"
3478,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,priest.
3479,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,To her husband I have written; he will have the news to-day:
3480,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"If he cares again to see her, he had best be on his way!"""
3481,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,
3482,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"Now the priest has done his office; at the open door he stands,"
3483,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"And he says to Marianna: ""I can leave her in your hands,—"
3484,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"I have other work that calls me; if to-night she chance to die,"
3485,*THE MANSION IN HEAVEN*,"You can say the prayers, good sister, for her soul as well as"
3486,"I.""","I."""
3487,"I.""",
3488,"I.""","So they left her, all unaided, in the house forlorn and sad,"
3489,"I.""",Still to watch and think and labour with what failing strength
3490,"I.""",she had.
3491,"I.""","There was none to share her burden, none to speak to, none to"
3492,"I.""",see—
3493,"I.""","Save a helpful boy of seven, and a restless one of three,"
3494,"I.""","And their little dark-eyed sister (she was five, and came"
3495,"I.""","between),"
3496,"I.""","And a baby, born that winter, which the father had not seen."
3497,"I.""",
3498,"I.""","Two days more!  Her friend lay sleeping, and she watched beside"
3499,"I.""",the bed:
3500,"I.""","In her arms she rocked the baby, while the Latin prayers she"
3501,"I.""","said,—"
3502,"I.""",Prayers to help a soul departing;—yet she never quite despaired!
3503,"I.""","Might not yet the Lord have pity, and that mother’s life be"
3504,"I.""",spared?
3505,"I.""","’T was so hard to see her going—such a mother, kind and dear!"
3506,"I.""","There was ne’er another like her in the country, far or near!"
3507,"I.""",(So thought Sister Marianna.)  Yet to murmur were a sin.
3508,"I.""","But her tears kept rising, rising, though she tried to hold them"
3509,"I.""","in,"
3510,"I.""","Till one fell and lay there shining, on the head that she"
3511,"I.""","caressed,"
3512,"I.""","Small and pretty, dark and downy, lying warm against her breast,"
3513,"I.""",She was silent; something moved her that had neither place nor
3514,"I.""",part
3515,"I.""",In the grave and stately cadence of the prayers she knew by
3516,"I.""",heart.
3517,"I.""","Then she spoke, with eyes dilated, with her soul in every word,"
3518,"I.""","As to one she saw before her—""Thou hast been a child, my Lord!"
3519,"I.""",Thou hast lain as small and speechless as this infant on my
3520,"I.""",knees;
3521,"I.""",Thou hast stretched toward Thy Mother little helpless hands like
3522,"I.""",these:
3523,"I.""","Thou hast known the wants of children, then—  Oh, listen to my"
3524,"I.""","plea,"
3525,"I.""","For one moment, Lord, remember what Thy Mother was to Thee!"
3526,"I.""","Think, when all was dark around Thee how her love did Thee"
3527,"I.""",enfold;
3528,"I.""","How she tended, how she watched Thee; how she wrapped Thee from"
3529,"I.""",the cold!
3530,"I.""","How her gentle heart was beating, on that night of tears and"
3531,"I.""","strife,"
3532,"I.""","When the cruel guards pursued Thee, when King Herod sought Thy"
3533,"I.""",life!
3534,"I.""","How her arms enclosed and hid Thee, through that midnight"
3535,"I.""",journey wild!
3536,"I.""","Oh, for love of Thine own Mother, save the mother of this"
3537,"I.""","child!"""
3538,"I.""",
3539,"I.""",Now she paused and waited breathless; for she seemed to know and
3540,"I.""",feel
3541,"I.""","That the Lord was there, and listened to her passionate appeal."
3542,"I.""","Then she bowed her head, all trembling; but a light was in her"
3543,"I.""","eye,"
3544,"I.""",For her soul had heard the answer: that young mother would not
3545,"I.""",die!
3546,"I.""","Yes, the prayer of faith had saved her!  And a change began that"
3547,"I.""",day:
3548,"I.""","When she woke her breath was easy, and the pain had passed away."
3549,"I.""","So the day that dawned so sadly had a bright and hopeful close,"
3550,"I.""","And a solemn, sweet thanksgiving from the sister’s heart arose."
3551,"I.""",
3552,"I.""","Now the night had closed around them, and a lonesome night it"
3553,"I.""",seemed!
3554,"I.""","For the sky was black and starless, and for hours the rain had"
3555,"I.""",streamed:
3556,"I.""","And the wind and rain together made a wild and mournful din,"
3557,"I.""","As they beat on door and window, madly struggling to come in."
3558,"I.""",
3559,"I.""","Marianna, faint and weary with the strain of many days,"
3560,"I.""","On the broad stone hearth was kneeling, while she set the fire"
3561,"I.""","ablaze,"
3562,"I.""","For the poor lone soul she cared for would, ere morning, need to"
3563,"I.""",eat.
3564,"I.""","""Now, God help me,"" said the sister, ""this night’s labour to"
3565,"I.""","complete!"""
3566,"I.""","’T was a meal she knew would please her, which she lovingly"
3567,"I.""","prepared,"
3568,"I.""","Of that best and chosen portion, from the convent table spared,"
3569,"I.""","Which she brought, as was her habit, with much other needed"
3570,"I.""","store,"
3571,"I.""","In the worn old willow basket, standing near her on the floor."
3572,"I.""",
3573,"I.""","On her work was much depending, so she planned to do her best;"
3574,"I.""","And she set the earthen pitcher on the coals as in a nest,"
3575,"I.""","With the embers laid around it; then she thought again, and cast"
3576,"I.""","On the pile a few gray ashes, that it might not boil too fast."
3577,"I.""","But the touch of sleep was on her, she was dreaming while she"
3578,"I.""","planned,"
3579,"I.""",And the wooden spoon kept falling from her limp and listless
3580,"I.""",hand.
3581,"I.""","Then she roused her, struggling bravely with this languor, which"
3582,"I.""",she viewed
3583,"I.""","As a snare, a sore temptation, to be fought with and subdued."
3584,"I.""",But another fear assailed her—what if she should faint or fall?
3585,"I.""",And to-night the storm-swept cottage seems so far away from all!
3586,"I.""",How the fitful wind is moaning!  And between the gusts that
3587,"I.""","blow,"
3588,"I.""","She can hear the torrent roaring, in the deep ravine below."
3589,"I.""",
3590,"I.""","And her head is aching strangely, as it never did before:"
3591,"I.""","""Good Lord, help me!"" she is saying: ""this can last but little"
3592,"I.""",more!
3593,"I.""","O my blessèd Lord and Master, only help me through the night—"
3594,"I.""",Only keep my eyes from closing till they see the morning light!
3595,"I.""","For that mother and that baby do so weak and helpless lie,"
3596,"I.""","And with only me to serve them,—if I leave them, they may die!"
3597,"I.""","She is better—yes, I know it, but a touch may turn the scale."
3598,"I.""","I can send for help to-morrow, but to-night I must not fail!"""
3599,"I.""","’T was in vain; for sleep had conquered, and the words she tried"
3600,"I.""",to say
3601,"I.""","First became a drowsy murmur, then grew faint and died away."
3602,"I.""","And she slept as sleep the weary, heedless how the night went"
3603,"I.""","on,"
3604,"I.""","With her pitcher all untended, with her labour all undone;"
3605,"I.""","On the wall her head reclining, in the chimney’s empty space,"
3606,"I.""",While the firelight flared and flickered on her pale and
3607,"I.""",peaceful face.
3608,"I.""","Was her humble prayer unanswered?  Oh, the Lord has many a way"
3609,"I.""","That His children little think of, to send answers when they"
3610,"I.""",pray!
3611,"I.""",It was long she sat there sleeping—do you think her work was
3612,"I.""",spoiled?
3613,"I.""","No, the fir-wood fire kept burning, and the pitcher gently"
3614,"I.""",boiled:
3615,"I.""","Ne’er a taint of smoke had touched it, nor one precious drop"
3616,"I.""",been spilt;
3617,"I.""","When she moved and looked around her, with a sudden sense of"
3618,"I.""",guilt.
3619,"I.""","But her eyes, when first they opened, saw a vision, strange and"
3620,"I.""","sweet,"
3621,"I.""",For a little Child was standing on the hearth-stone at her feet.
3622,"I.""","And He seemed no earthly infant, for His robe was like the snow,"
3623,"I.""",And a glory shone about Him that was not the firelight glow.
3624,"I.""","And Himself her work was doing!  For He kept the fire alive,"
3625,"I.""","And He watched the earthen pitcher, that no danger might arrive"
3626,"I.""","To the simple meal, now ready, with the coals around it piled;"
3627,"I.""","Then He turned His face toward her, and she knew the Holy Child."
3628,"I.""",’T was her Lord who stood before her!  And she did not shrink
3629,"I.""",nor start—
3630,"I.""",There was more of joy than wonder in her all-believing heart.
3631,"I.""","When her willing hands were weary, when her patient eyes were"
3632,"I.""","closed,"
3633,"I.""","He had finished all she failed in, He had watched while she"
3634,"I.""",reposed.
3635,"I.""",Do you ask of His appearance?  Human words are weak and cold;
3636,"I.""",’T is enough to say she knew Him—that is all she ever told.
3637,"I.""","Yes, as you and I will know Him when that happy day shall come,"
3638,"I.""","When, if we on earth have loved Him, He will bid us welcome"
3639,"I.""",home!
3640,"I.""","But with that one look He left her, and the vision all had"

3642,"I.""",(Though the peace it left within her to her dying hour would
3643,"I.""",last!)
3644,"I.""","Storm had ceased, and wind was silent, there was no more sound"
3645,"I.""","of rain,"
3646,"I.""",And the morning star was shining through the window’s broken
3647,"I.""",pane.
3648,"I.""",
3649,"I.""","Later, when the sun was rising, Marianna looked to see,"
3650,"I.""","O’er the stretch of rain-washed country, what the day was like"
3651,"I.""","to be,"
3652,"I.""","While the door she softly opened, letting in the morning breeze,"
3653,"I.""",As it shook the drops by thousands from the wet and shining
3654,"I.""",trees.

4106,*THE MOUNTAIN*,*THE MOUNTAIN*
4107,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4108,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4109,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"A wild, sad story I tell to-day,"
4110,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And I pray you to listen all!
4111,*THE MOUNTAIN*,You cannot think how my heart is moved
4112,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"As the legend I recall,—"
4113,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4114,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"The legend that made me weep so oft,"
4115,*THE MOUNTAIN*,When I was a child like you!
4116,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"I tell it now, in my life’s decline,"
4117,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And it brings the tears anew.
4118,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4119,*THE MOUNTAIN*,It came to us down through ages long;
4120,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For this story had its scene
4121,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In the far-away, gorgeous, stormy days"
4122,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Of the empire Byzantine.
4123,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4124,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And it tells of a famous mountain chief,"
4125,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"A terrible, fierce brigand,"
4126,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Who ravaged the country, far and wide,"
4127,*THE MOUNTAIN*,At the head of an armèd band.
4128,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4129,*THE MOUNTAIN*,So hard of heart was this evil man
4130,*THE MOUNTAIN*,That he spared not young nor old:
4131,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"He killed and plundered, and burned and spoiled,"
4132,*THE MOUNTAIN*,In his maddening thirst for gold;
4133,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4134,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Would come with a swoop on a merchant troop,"
4135,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"That peacefully went its way,"
4136,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And the counted gains of a journey long
4137,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Were scattered in one short day!
4138,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4139,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"He knew no pity, he owned no law,"
4140,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Nor human, nor yet divine;"
4141,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Would take the gold from a Prince’s chest,"
4142,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Or the lamp from a wayside shrine.
4143,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4144,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In hidden valley, in wild ravine,"
4145,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"On desolate, heath-grown hill,"
4146,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"He buried his treasure away from sight,"
4147,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And most of it lies there still.
4148,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4149,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And none were free in that land to dwell,"
4150,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Except they a tribute paid;
4151,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"For the robber chief, who was more than king,"
4152,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Had this burden on them laid.
4153,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4154,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"If any dared to resist the claim,"
4155,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He was met with vengeance dire;
4156,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"His lands were wasted before the dawn,"
4157,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And his harvest burned with fire.
4158,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4159,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And some day maybe himself was slain,"
4160,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And left in the road to lie;
4161,*THE MOUNTAIN*,To fill with terror the quaking heart
4162,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Of the next who journeyed by.
4163,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4164,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And many fled to the towns afar,"
4165,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And their fields were left untilled;
4166,*THE MOUNTAIN*,While want and trouble and trembling fear
4167,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Had the stricken country filled.
4168,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4169,*THE MOUNTAIN*,High up on a mountain’s pathless side
4170,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Had the robber made his den,"
4171,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In a rocky cave, where he reigned supreme"
4172,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Over twenty lawless men.
4173,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4174,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"A price had long on his head been set,"
4175,*THE MOUNTAIN*,But for that he little cared;
4176,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"For few were they who could climb the way,"
4177,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And fewer were those who dared.
4178,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4179,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For those who hunted him long before
4180,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Had a fearful story brought:
4181,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"They were not men on the mountain side,"
4182,*THE MOUNTAIN*,But demons who with them fought!
4183,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4184,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"For horrible forms arose, they said,"
4185,*THE MOUNTAIN*,As if from the earth they grew;
4186,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And rolled down rocks from the cliffs above
4187,*THE MOUNTAIN*,On any who might pursue.
4188,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4189,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"From town to town and from land to land,"
4190,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Had his evil fame been spread;
4191,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And voices lowered and lips grew grave
4192,*THE MOUNTAIN*,When the hated name they said.
4193,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4194,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"The people’s heart had grown faint with fear,"
4195,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And they thought no hope remained;
4196,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"But hope again on their vision dawned,"
4197,*THE MOUNTAIN*,When the Emperor’s ear they gained.
4198,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4199,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Mauritius reigned o’er the nations then;
4200,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"He was great in warlike fame,"
4201,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And he was not one to shrink or quake
4202,*THE MOUNTAIN*,At a mountain bandit’s name.
4203,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4204,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He sent a band of a hundred strong
4205,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"For the troubled land’s release,"
4206,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"To kill the man and his bloody crew,"
4207,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And to give the country peace.
4208,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4209,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For what was a robber chief to him?
4210,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He had conquered mighty kings;
4211,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"He gave the order, and then ’t was done,"
4212,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And he thought of other things.
4213,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4214,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"But few, alas, of that troop returned,"
4215,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And they told a ghostly tale;
4216,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And women wept, and the strongest men,"
4217,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"As they heard, grew mute and pale."
4218,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4219,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Those soldiers oft in the war had been,"
4220,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And they counted danger light;
4221,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"From mortal foe had they never turned,"
4222,*THE MOUNTAIN*,But with demons who could fight?
4223,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4224,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"The Emperor silent was and grave,"
4225,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For his thoughts were deep and wise;
4226,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He saw that the robber chief was one
4227,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Whom he could not well despise.
4228,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4229,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"There might be reason in what they said,"
4230,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"That the demons gave him aid,"
4231,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And earthly weapon would ne’er be found
4232,*THE MOUNTAIN*,That could make such foes afraid.
4233,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4234,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"But yet they will flee from sacred things,"
4235,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And the martyred saints, he knew,"
4236,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Have holy virtue, that to them clings,"
4237,*THE MOUNTAIN*,That can all their spells undo.
4238,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4239,*THE MOUNTAIN*,But how could such weapon reach the soul
4240,*THE MOUNTAIN*,That for years had owned their sway?
4241,*THE MOUNTAIN*,A question grave that he pondered long;
4242,*THE MOUNTAIN*,But at length he found a way.
4243,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4244,*THE MOUNTAIN*,A reliquary he made prepare;
4245,*THE MOUNTAIN*,It was all of finest gold:
4246,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"For as monarch might with monarch treat,"
4247,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He would serve this bandit bold.
4248,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4249,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"The gold was his, but the work he gave"
4250,*THE MOUNTAIN*,To the skilled and patient hand
4251,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Of an artist monk, who counted then"
4252,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For the first in all the land.
4253,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4254,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Now see him close to his labour bent,"
4255,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In a cell remote and high,"
4256,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Where all he saw of the world without
4257,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Was a square of roof and sky.
4258,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4259,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"A holy man was this artist monk,"
4260,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And for gain he did not ask,"
4261,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"If only the Lord his work would bless,"
4262,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For his heart was in the task.
4263,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4264,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And day by day from his touch came forth
4265,*THE MOUNTAIN*,The image of holy things;
4266,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"The cross was there, and the clustered vine,"
4267,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And the dove with outspread wings,—"
4268,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4269,*THE MOUNTAIN*,The dove that bore in her golden beak
4270,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"The olive in sign of peace,"
4271,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And still, as he wrought, his hand kept time"
4272,*THE MOUNTAIN*,To the prayer that would not cease!
4273,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4274,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For pity stirred in him when he thought
4275,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Of that dark and stormy breast,"
4276,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"So hard, so hopeless, from God so far,"
4277,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Where the little shrine would rest.
4278,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4279,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And perhaps if angels were looking on,"
4280,*THE MOUNTAIN*,(And I doubt not some were there!)
4281,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"They saw that the work was sown with pearls,"
4282,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And each pearl a burning prayer.
4283,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4284,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"So weeks went on, and the shrine was done,"
4285,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And within it, sealed and closed,"
4286,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Were holy relics of martyred saints
4287,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Who near in the church reposed.
4288,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4289,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And trusted messengers bore it forth
4290,*THE MOUNTAIN*,To the distant mountain land;
4291,*THE MOUNTAIN*,With such a weapon they need not fear;
4292,*THE MOUNTAIN*,They could meet the famed brigand.
4293,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4294,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"’T was winter now on the mountain-side,"
4295,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And the way was long and hard,"
4296,*THE MOUNTAIN*,As the faithful envoys upward toiled
4297,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In their bandit escort’s guard,—"
4298,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4299,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Toiled up to a grove of ancient firs,"
4300,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"For that was the place designed,"
4301,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Where, after parley and long delay,"
4302,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Had the meeting been combined.
4303,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4304,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"No sound but their feet that crushed the snow,"
4305,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And the world looked sad and dead;
4306,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"They thought of lives on the mountain lost,"
4307,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And it was not much they said.
4308,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4309,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"The sun, as it shone with slanting ray"
4310,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Through the stripped and silent trees,"
4311,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Could melt but little the clinging ice
4312,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Which to-night again would freeze.
4313,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4314,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"They reached the grove, and the chief was there,"
4315,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Like a king in savage state;
4316,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Erect and fearless, above them all,"
4317,*THE MOUNTAIN*,While his men around him wait.
4318,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4319,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"He stood before them like what he was,"
4320,*THE MOUNTAIN*,A terrible beast of prey;
4321,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"But even tigers have something grand,"
4322,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And he looked as grand as they.
4323,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4324,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"But, oh, the look that he on them turned!"
4325,*THE MOUNTAIN*,It was fearful to behold;
4326,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"It chilled their hearts, but they did not shrink,"
4327,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For their faith had made them bold.
4328,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4329,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And looking straight in those gloomy eyes,"
4330,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"With their hard and cruel glare,"
4331,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"""We come,"" said one, ""in the Emperor’s name,"
4332,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And from him a token bear."""
4333,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4334,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Then said the chief, with a mocking smile,"
4335,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"""And what may my Lord command?"""
4336,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And made a sign with his evil eye,"
4337,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For the men on guard to stand.
4338,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4339,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"No faith had he in a tale so wild,"
4340,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And he somewhat feared a snare;
4341,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"There might be others in hiding near,"
4342,*THE MOUNTAIN*,But he did not greatly care.
4343,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4344,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Then forth came he who the relics bore,—"
4345,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"’T was a prudent man and brave,—"
4346,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And into the hand that all men feared,"
4347,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He the holy token gave.
4348,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4349,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"""This gift to you has the Emperor sent,"
4350,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In token of his good will,"""
4351,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He said; and at first the fierce brigand
4352,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Stood in wonder, hushed and still."
4353,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4354,*THE MOUNTAIN*,What felt he then as that holy thing
4355,*THE MOUNTAIN*,In his guilty hand he took?
4356,*THE MOUNTAIN*,What changed his face for a moment’s time
4357,*THE MOUNTAIN*,To an almost human look?
4358,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4359,*THE MOUNTAIN*,There lay the shrine in his open palm.
4360,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Yet he thought it could not be:
4361,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"""For me?"" he asked, but his voice was strange."
4362,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And again he said, ""for me?"""
4363,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4364,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Three times the messenger told his tale,"
4365,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And he said ’t was all he knew;
4366,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"The bandit looked at the wondrous work,"
4367,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And he could not doubt ’t was true.
4368,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4369,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"So over his neck the chain he hung,"
4370,*THE MOUNTAIN*,The shrine on his bosom lay
4371,*THE MOUNTAIN*,With all its wealth of a thousand prayers;
4372,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And they were not cast away.
4373,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4374,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Day followed day in the bandit’s cave,"
4375,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And a restless man was he;
4376,*THE MOUNTAIN*,A heart so hard and so proud as his
4377,*THE MOUNTAIN*,With the saints could ill agree.
4378,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4379,*THE MOUNTAIN*,The holy relics that on it lay
4380,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Did a strange confusion make;
4381,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In all that most he had loved before,"
4382,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He could no more pleasure take.
4383,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4384,*THE MOUNTAIN*,A charm there was in the golden shrine
4385,*THE MOUNTAIN*,That had all his soul possessed;
4386,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He sat and looked at each sacred sign
4387,*THE MOUNTAIN*,With a dreamy sense of rest.
4388,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4389,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"’T was not the gold that could soothe him thus,"
4390,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And ’t was not the work so fine:
4391,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"’T was the holy soul of the artist monk,"
4392,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For it lived in every line.
4393,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4394,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Like one who sleeps when the day begins,"
4395,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And, before his slumbers end,"
4396,*THE MOUNTAIN*,The morning light and the morning sounds
4397,*THE MOUNTAIN*,With his dreaming fancies blend;
4398,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4399,*THE MOUNTAIN*,So now and then would his heart be stirred
4400,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"By a feeling strange and new,"
4401,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And thoughts he never had known before
4402,*THE MOUNTAIN*,In his mind unconscious grew.
4403,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4404,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Till on a sudden his blinding pride,"
4405,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Like a bubble, failed and broke;"
4406,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"With eyes wide open, the guilty man"
4407,*THE MOUNTAIN*,From his life-long dream awoke.
4408,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4409,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"From graves forgotten his crimes came forth,"
4410,*THE MOUNTAIN*,In his face they seemed to stare:
4411,*THE MOUNTAIN*,To all one day will such waking come;
4412,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"God grant it be here, not there."
4413,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4414,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Then wild remorse on his heart took hold,"
4415,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And beneath its burning sting
4416,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He shrank from himself as one might shrink
4417,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"From a venomous, hateful thing."
4418,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4419,*THE MOUNTAIN*,For scenes of blood from the years gone by
4420,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Forever before him came;
4421,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"He closed his eyes, and his face he hid,"
4422,*THE MOUNTAIN*,But he saw them just the same.
4423,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4424,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And in the horror he dared not pray,"
4425,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"For he felt his soul accurst,"
4426,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And he feared to live, and he feared to die,"
4427,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And he knew not which was worst.
4428,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4429,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Yet far on high, and beyond his reach,"
4430,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"He could see a vision dim,"
4431,*THE MOUNTAIN*,A far-off glory of peace and love;
4432,*THE MOUNTAIN*,But he felt ’t was not for him.
4433,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4434,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Awhile his trouble he hid from all,"
4435,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"For his will was iron strong,"
4436,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"But never was man, since man was made,"
4437,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Who could bear such torment long,"
4438,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4439,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"A strange, sick longing was growing up"
4440,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In his spirit, day by day,"
4441,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"A longing for what he most had feared,—"
4442,*THE MOUNTAIN*,To let justice have her way;
4443,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4444,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Until the will to a purpose grew,"
4445,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"To the Emperor’s feet to fly,"
4446,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"To own his sin without prayer or plea,"
4447,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And then give up all and die.
4448,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4449,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And so one night, without sound or word,"
4450,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Away in the dark he stole,"
4451,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And all that he took for his journey long
4452,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Was the weight of a burdened soul.
4453,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4454,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"They waited long in that den of crime,"
4455,*THE MOUNTAIN*,But they saw their chief no more;
4456,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Or dead or living, they found him not,"
4457,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Though they searched the mountain o’er.
4458,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4459,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And in the country, so long oppressed,"
4460,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"When his sudden flight was known,"
4461,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"They spoke of a wild and fearful night,"
4462,*THE MOUNTAIN*,When the fiends had claimed their own.
4463,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4464,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And soon the tale to a legend turned,"
4465,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And men trembling used to tell
4466,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Of how they carried him, body and soul,"
4467,*THE MOUNTAIN*,To the place where demons dwell.
4468,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4469,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"His men, so bold, were in mortal fear"
4470,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Of what might themselves befall;
4471,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"So some in a convent refuge sought,"
4472,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And the rest were scattered all.
4473,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4474,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And no one climbed to their empty cave,"
4475,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"For ’t was called a haunted place,"
4476,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Though soon the summer had swept away
4477,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Of its horror every trace,"
4478,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4479,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And mountain strawberries nestled low,"
4480,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And delicate harebells hung,"
4481,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In beauty meek, from its broken arch,"
4482,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Where the swallows reared their young.
4483,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4484,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"But where had he gone, that man of woe?"
4485,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Had he found the rest he sought?
4486,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In haste he went, but with noiseless tread,"
4487,*THE MOUNTAIN*,As his bandit life had taught.
4488,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4489,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And going downward he met the spring,"
4490,*THE MOUNTAIN*,With its mingled sun and showers;
4491,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"But storms of winter he bore within,"
4492,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And he did not see the flowers.
4493,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4494,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And how did he live from day to day,"
4495,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And the ceaseless strain endure?
4496,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Kind hearts there are that can feel for all,"
4497,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And the poor will help the poor.
4498,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4499,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"In frightened pity, a shepherd girl,"
4500,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"As she fled o’er the daisied grass,"
4501,*THE MOUNTAIN*,Would let the bread from her apron fall
4502,*THE MOUNTAIN*,On the turf where he should pass;
4503,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4504,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Or workmen, eating their noonday meal"
4505,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"On a bank beside the way,"
4506,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Would give him food, but with outstretched arm,"
4507,*THE MOUNTAIN*,And they asked him not to stay.
4508,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4509,*THE MOUNTAIN*,He went like a shadow taken shape
4510,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"From some vague and awful dream,"
4511,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And word of comfort for him was none,"
4512,*THE MOUNTAIN*,In his misery so extreme.
4513,*THE MOUNTAIN*,
4514,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Alas, from himself he could not flee,"
4515,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"Though he tried, poor haunted man;"
4516,*THE MOUNTAIN*,"And he reached the city beside the sea,"
4517,*THE MOUNTAIN*,As the Holy Week began.

4551,_PART SECOND_,"The nobles all in their rich array,"
4552,_PART SECOND_,And the guards with sounding march.
4553,_PART SECOND_,
4554,_PART SECOND_,"And stay, the square is as still as death,"
4555,_PART SECOND_,For the Emperor passes now;
4556,_PART SECOND_,"The girls at the window hold their breath,"
4557,_PART SECOND_,And the people bend and bow.
4558,_PART SECOND_,
4559,_PART SECOND_,But who is this that among them moves
4560,_PART SECOND_,With that quick and stately pace?
4561,_PART SECOND_,"What see they all in his rigid look,"
4562,_PART SECOND_,That they shrink and give him place?
4563,_PART SECOND_,
4564,_PART SECOND_,"Too late the guards would have barred the way,"
4565,_PART SECOND_,"For he darted swiftly by,"
4566,_PART SECOND_,"As hunted creatures, when hard beset,"
4567,_PART SECOND_,To man in their terror fly.
4568,_PART SECOND_,
4569,_PART SECOND_,And sinking low at the feet of him
4570,_PART SECOND_,"He had come so far to see,"
4571,_PART SECOND_,"He waited silent with folded hands,"
4572,_PART SECOND_,Nor asked what his fate should be.
4573,_PART SECOND_,
4574,_PART SECOND_,"""Who are you, come in such deep distress,"
4575,_PART SECOND_,"And what is the grace you seek?"""
4576,_PART SECOND_,"The Emperor’s voice was grave and kind,"
4577,_PART SECOND_,And the stranger tried to speak.
4578,_PART SECOND_,
4579,_PART SECOND_,"The golden casket he raised in sight,"
4580,_PART SECOND_,While he bent his eyes for shame;
4581,_PART SECOND_,"Then said he, ""I am that wicked man,"""
4582,_PART SECOND_,And he told the dreaded name.
4583,_PART SECOND_,
4584,_PART SECOND_,"A shudder fell upon all who heard,"
4585,_PART SECOND_,But the people nearer drew;
4586,_PART SECOND_,"From mouth to mouth, in a whisper low,"
4587,_PART SECOND_,The name of the bandit flew.
4588,_PART SECOND_,
4589,_PART SECOND_,"While he, uplifting those woful eyes,"
4590,_PART SECOND_,"In the boldness of despair,"
4591,_PART SECOND_,"With ne’er a thought of the crowd who heard,"
4592,_PART SECOND_,His errand did thus declare:
4593,_PART SECOND_,
4594,_PART SECOND_,"""I come not here to confess my sins,"
4595,_PART SECOND_,For you know them all too well;
4596,_PART SECOND_,"My crimes are many and black and great,"
4597,_PART SECOND_,They are more than tongue can tell.
4598,_PART SECOND_,
4599,_PART SECOND_,"""But here at your feet my life I lay,"
4600,_PART SECOND_,I have nothing else to give;
4601,_PART SECOND_,"So now, if it please you, speak the word,"
4602,_PART SECOND_,"For I am not fit to live."""
4603,_PART SECOND_,
4604,_PART SECOND_,The words came straight from his broken heart
4605,_PART SECOND_,"In such sad and simple style,"
4606,_PART SECOND_,"That the Emperor’s firm, proud lips were moved"
4607,_PART SECOND_,To a somewhat softened smile.
4608,_PART SECOND_,
4609,_PART SECOND_,For his warlike spirit felt the charm
4610,_PART SECOND_,"Of that savage strength and grace,"
4611,_PART SECOND_,And the strange fierce beauty that lingered still
4612,_PART SECOND_,In the dark and troubled face.
4613,_PART SECOND_,
4614,_PART SECOND_,"So grand of form and so lithe of limb,"
4615,_PART SECOND_,"And still in his manhood’s prime,"
4616,_PART SECOND_,’T would be a pity for one like him
4617,_PART SECOND_,To perish before his time.
4618,_PART SECOND_,
4619,_PART SECOND_,"And ’t was well to see him kneeling there,"
4620,_PART SECOND_,"Whose terror had filled the land,"
4621,_PART SECOND_,"Like a captive tiger, caught and tamed"
4622,_PART SECOND_,By his own imperial hand.
4623,_PART SECOND_,
4624,_PART SECOND_,"""Arise,"" he said, ""you have nought to fear,"
4625,_PART SECOND_,"Take comfort and go your way,"
4626,_PART SECOND_,"And may God in heaven my sins forgive,"
4627,_PART SECOND_,"As I pardon yours to-day."""
4628,_PART SECOND_,
4629,_PART SECOND_,"A murmur rose from the crowded square,"
4630,_PART SECOND_,At the sound of words like these;
4631,_PART SECOND_,"For some rejoiced in the mercy shown,"
4632,_PART SECOND_,And others it did not please.
4633,_PART SECOND_,
4634,_PART SECOND_,"Some thanked the Lord for the pardoned man,"
4635,_PART SECOND_,And some were to scorn inclined;
4636,_PART SECOND_,"And motherly women wiped their eyes,"
4637,_PART SECOND_,For the women’s hearts are kind.
4638,_PART SECOND_,
4639,_PART SECOND_,"""God bless our Emperor,"" many said;"
4640,_PART SECOND_,But others began to frown.
4641,_PART SECOND_,"And asked, ""Will he turn this wild brigand"
4642,_PART SECOND_,"Adrift in our peaceful town?"""
4643,_PART SECOND_,
4644,_PART SECOND_,"No word of thanks did the bandit say,"
4645,_PART SECOND_,But he raised one shining fold
4646,_PART SECOND_,"Of the robe imperial, trailing low"
4647,_PART SECOND_,With its weight of gems and gold.
4648,_PART SECOND_,
4649,_PART SECOND_,"The border first to his lips he pressed,"
4650,_PART SECOND_,And then to his heavy heart;
4651,_PART SECOND_,"Then rose and waited with bended head,"
4652,_PART SECOND_,Till he saw them all depart.
4653,_PART SECOND_,
4654,_PART SECOND_,"No eye had he for the gorgeous train,"
4655,_PART SECOND_,As along the square it passed;
4656,_PART SECOND_,"One stately presence was all he knew,"
4657,_PART SECOND_,And he watched it till the last.
4658,_PART SECOND_,
4659,_PART SECOND_,"A heavy sigh, and he turned away,"
4660,_PART SECOND_,But with slow and weary tread;
4661,_PART SECOND_,"No rest as yet on the earth for him,"
4662,_PART SECOND_,Not even among the dead.
4663,_PART SECOND_,
4664,_PART SECOND_,"He lived, and he bore his burden still,"
4665,_PART SECOND_,But the dumb despair had ceased:
4666,_PART SECOND_,"That word of mercy had brought a change,"
4667,_PART SECOND_,"And he now had tears, at least;"
4668,_PART SECOND_,
4669,_PART SECOND_,"He now could pray, though it brought not light,"
4670,_PART SECOND_,"And he seemed to ask in vain,"
4671,_PART SECOND_,"And his prayer had more of tears than words,"
4672,_PART SECOND_,But it helped him bear the pain.
4673,_PART SECOND_,
4674,_PART SECOND_,And oft in church did they see him kneel
4675,_PART SECOND_,"In some corner all alone,"
4676,_PART SECOND_,And weep till the great hot drops would fall
4677,_PART SECOND_,On the floor of varied stone.
4678,_PART SECOND_,
4679,_PART SECOND_,"And children clung to their mothers’ hand,"
4680,_PART SECOND_,"When they saw that vision wild,—"
4681,_PART SECOND_,"That haggard face, and that wasting form,"
4682,_PART SECOND_,And those lips that never smiled.
4683,_PART SECOND_,
4684,_PART SECOND_,"But grief was wearing his life away,"
4685,_PART SECOND_,And for him perhaps ’t was well;
4686,_PART SECOND_,It was not long on the city street
4687,_PART SECOND_,That his saddening shadow fell.
4688,_PART SECOND_,
4689,_PART SECOND_,"A fever slowly within him burned,"
4690,_PART SECOND_,"Till the springs of life were dry,"
4691,_PART SECOND_,And glad he was when they laid him down
4692,_PART SECOND_,On a hospital bed to die.
4693,_PART SECOND_,
4694,_PART SECOND_,"His heart was broken, his strength was gone,"
4695,_PART SECOND_,He had no more wish to live;
4696,_PART SECOND_,"He almost hoped that the Lord on high,"
4697,_PART SECOND_,"Like the Emperor, might forgive;"
4698,_PART SECOND_,
4699,_PART SECOND_,That somewhere down in the peaceful earth
4700,_PART SECOND_,"He should find a refuge yet,"
4701,_PART SECOND_,"A place to rest and his eyes to close,"
4702,_PART SECOND_,And the woful past forget.
4703,_PART SECOND_,
4704,_PART SECOND_,"He could not lie where the others lay,"
4705,_PART SECOND_,"For such gloom around him spread,"
4706,_PART SECOND_,That soon in a chamber far away
4707,_PART SECOND_,Had they set his friendless bed.
4708,_PART SECOND_,
4709,_PART SECOND_,"’T was there he suffered and wept and prayed,"
4710,_PART SECOND_,From the eyes of all concealed:
4711,_PART SECOND_,Alas! but it takes a weary time
4712,_PART SECOND_,For a life like his to yield.
4713,_PART SECOND_,
4714,_PART SECOND_,The grand old hospital where he died
4715,_PART SECOND_,Was beneath the watchful care
4716,_PART SECOND_,"Of a certain doctor, famed afar"
4717,_PART SECOND_,For his skill and learning rare.
4718,_PART SECOND_,
4719,_PART SECOND_,But more than learning and more than skill
4720,_PART SECOND_,"Was his heart, so large and kind,"
4721,_PART SECOND_,That knew the trouble and felt the needs
4722,_PART SECOND_,Of the sick who near him pined.
4723,_PART SECOND_,
4724,_PART SECOND_,With conscience pure had he served the Lord
4725,_PART SECOND_,"From youth till his hair was grey,"
4726,_PART SECOND_,"Yet only pity he felt, not scorn,"
4727,_PART SECOND_,For the many feet that stray.
4728,_PART SECOND_,
4729,_PART SECOND_,In troubled scenes had his life been passed;
4730,_PART SECOND_,"He was used to woe and sin,"
4731,_PART SECOND_,And when men suffered he did not ask
4732,_PART SECOND_,If their lives had blameless been.
4733,_PART SECOND_,
4734,_PART SECOND_,"His part was but to relieve their pain,"
4735,_PART SECOND_,And he helped and soothed and cheered;
4736,_PART SECOND_,But most he cared for the stricken man
4737,_PART SECOND_,Whom the others shunned and feared.
4738,_PART SECOND_,
4739,_PART SECOND_,"Each art to save him he tried in vain,"
4740,_PART SECOND_,"And it could but useless prove,"
4741,_PART SECOND_,For the poisoned thorn that pierced his heart
4742,_PART SECOND_,"Could no earthly hand remove,"
4743,_PART SECOND_,
4744,_PART SECOND_,"When hope had failed, he would kneel and pray,"
4745,_PART SECOND_,"And his heart with tears outpour,"
4746,_PART SECOND_,That God in mercy would comfort send
4747,_PART SECOND_,To that soul in torment sore.
4748,_PART SECOND_,
4749,_PART SECOND_,"And though the burden he might not lift,"
4750,_PART SECOND_,He could help its weight to bear;
4751,_PART SECOND_,"He talked of mercy, of peace to come,"
4752,_PART SECOND_,And he bade him not despair.
4753,_PART SECOND_,
4754,_PART SECOND_,"And so, on the last sad night of all,"
4755,_PART SECOND_,"’T was the brave, good doctor came"
4756,_PART SECOND_,"To watch alone by the bandit’s side,"
4757,_PART SECOND_,When he died of grief and shame.
4758,_PART SECOND_,
4759,_PART SECOND_,"The spring to summer was wearing on,"
4760,_PART SECOND_,"’T was the fairest night in May,"
4761,_PART SECOND_,"When sleep to those eyes in mercy came,"
4762,_PART SECOND_,And the deadly strain gave way.
4763,_PART SECOND_,
4764,_PART SECOND_,"No candle burned, for the moon was full,"
4765,_PART SECOND_,And the peaceful splendour fell
4766,_PART SECOND_,"Through the open window, lighting all:"
4767,_PART SECOND_,It was like a kind farewell.
4768,_PART SECOND_,
4769,_PART SECOND_,"And scents from the garden floated in,"
4770,_PART SECOND_,"And the silent fireflies came,"
4771,_PART SECOND_,"And breathed and vanished, and breathed again,"
4772,_PART SECOND_,With their soft mysterious flame.
4773,_PART SECOND_,
4774,_PART SECOND_,"The doctor watched with a heavy heart,"
4775,_PART SECOND_,His head on his hand was bowed;
4776,_PART SECOND_,"He thought how many his prayers had been,"
4777,_PART SECOND_,But they could not lift the cloud.
4778,_PART SECOND_,
4779,_PART SECOND_,"’T was over now, there was nothing left"
4780,_PART SECOND_,For his pitying love to do;
4781,_PART SECOND_,"The worn-out body would rest at last,"
4782,_PART SECOND_,"But the guilty soul,—who knew?"
4783,_PART SECOND_,
4784,_PART SECOND_,No more to do but to watch and wait
4785,_PART SECOND_,Till the failing breath should cease;
4786,_PART SECOND_,"He longed, as the counted minutes flew,"
4787,_PART SECOND_,For one parting smile of peace.
4788,_PART SECOND_,
4789,_PART SECOND_,"He looked: a handkerchief veiled the eyes,"
4790,_PART SECOND_,"For they wept until the end,"
4791,_PART SECOND_,And sadly still on the wasted cheek
4792,_PART SECOND_,Did a few slow drops descend.
4793,_PART SECOND_,
4794,_PART SECOND_,The peace that oft to the dying comes
4795,_PART SECOND_,"Was to him as yet denied,—"
4796,_PART SECOND_,"No sunset clear after stormy day,"
4797,_PART SECOND_,And no brightening ere he died.
4798,_PART SECOND_,
4799,_PART SECOND_,"""Alas! he will go away to-night,"
4800,_PART SECOND_,"And without one hopeful sign,"
4801,_PART SECOND_,"Away from pity, away from care,"
4802,_PART SECOND_,"And from such poor help as mine!"""
4803,_PART SECOND_,
4804,_PART SECOND_,"The doctor sighed, but he hoped as well,"
4805,_PART SECOND_,"For he said, ""It cannot be"
4806,_PART SECOND_,"That the Lord, who died for all, will have"
4807,_PART SECOND_,"No mercy for such as he."""
4808,_PART SECOND_,
4809,_PART SECOND_,"’T was then that sleep on the doctor fell,"
4810,_PART SECOND_,"And before him stood revealed,"
4811,_PART SECOND_,"In dreaming vision, a wondrous sight,"
4812,_PART SECOND_,From his waking eyes concealed.
4813,_PART SECOND_,
4814,_PART SECOND_,"For other watchers were in the room,"
4815,_PART SECOND_,And he knew the ghastly throng
4816,_PART SECOND_,"Of demon spirits, the very same"
4817,_PART SECOND_,Whom the man had served so long.
4818,_PART SECOND_,
4819,_PART SECOND_,"And two were leaning across the bed,"
4820,_PART SECOND_,"And another pressed behind,"
4821,_PART SECOND_,"And some in the shadow waiting stood,"
4822,_PART SECOND_,With a chain his soul to bind.
4823,_PART SECOND_,
4824,_PART SECOND_,But angels watched by the bedside too;
4825,_PART SECOND_,"’T was a strange and solemn scene,—"
4826,_PART SECOND_,"The angels here and the demons there,"
4827,_PART SECOND_,And the dying man between.
4828,_PART SECOND_,
4829,_PART SECOND_,The angels looked with a troubled gaze
4830,_PART SECOND_,"On the face consumed with grief,"
4831,_PART SECOND_,"And over the pillow bent and swayed,"
4832,_PART SECOND_,As in haste to bring relief.
4833,_PART SECOND_,
4834,_PART SECOND_,And one on the bowed and burdened head
4835,_PART SECOND_,"Did a hand in blessing lay,"
4836,_PART SECOND_,"And he said, ""Poor soul, come home with us."
4837,_PART SECOND_,"Where the tears are wiped away."""
4838,_PART SECOND_,
4839,_PART SECOND_,"""Not so,"" cried one of the demon troop,"
4840,_PART SECOND_,"""He is black with every sin;"
4841,_PART SECOND_,And you may not touch our lawful prey
4842,_PART SECOND_,That we laboured years to win.
4843,_PART SECOND_,
4844,_PART SECOND_,"""We bought his soul, and the price we paid,"
4845,_PART SECOND_,And our part has well been done;
4846,_PART SECOND_,"We helped him ever from crime to crime,"
4847,_PART SECOND_,Till his buried wealth was won;
4848,_PART SECOND_,
4849,_PART SECOND_,"""And we almost thought him one of us,"
4850,_PART SECOND_,He had so well learned our ways;
4851,_PART SECOND_,"So go, for we do but seek our own,"
4852,_PART SECOND_,"And be done with these delays."""
4853,_PART SECOND_,
4854,_PART SECOND_,"The angel said, ""He has wept his sin,"
4855,_PART SECOND_,"As none ever wept before,"
4856,_PART SECOND_,"Has mourned till his very life gave way,"
4857,_PART SECOND_,And what could a man do more?
4858,_PART SECOND_,
4859,_PART SECOND_,"""And our Blessèd Lord, who pities all,"
4860,_PART SECOND_,"And the sins of all has borne,"
4861,_PART SECOND_,Will never His mercy turn away
4862,_PART SECOND_,"From a heart so bruised and torn."""
4863,_PART SECOND_,
4864,_PART SECOND_,"""But how? and shall mercy be for him"
4865,_PART SECOND_,Who has mercy never shown?
4866,_PART SECOND_,"Can his sorrow bring the dead to life,"
4867,_PART SECOND_,Or can tears for blood atone?
4868,_PART SECOND_,
4869,_PART SECOND_,"""Is he to rest with the angels now,"
4870,_PART SECOND_,Has he done with tears and pain?
4871,_PART SECOND_,To-morrow morn he will wish he lay
4872,_PART SECOND_,On the hospital bed again;
4873,_PART SECOND_,
4874,_PART SECOND_,"""There is somewhat more to weep for down"
4875,_PART SECOND_,"In the place where he must stay!"""
4876,_PART SECOND_,The demon looked at his fiendish mates;
4877,_PART SECOND_,"And he laughed, and so did they."
4878,_PART SECOND_,
4879,_PART SECOND_,"And they gathered close, like hungry wolves,"
4880,_PART SECOND_,In their haste to rend and tear;
4881,_PART SECOND_,But they could not touch the helpless head
4882,_PART SECOND_,While that strong white hand was there.
4883,_PART SECOND_,
4884,_PART SECOND_,"Then out of the shadow one came forth,"
4885,_PART SECOND_,’T was a demon great and tall;
4886,_PART SECOND_,"An iron balance he held on high,"
4887,_PART SECOND_,As he stood before them all.
4888,_PART SECOND_,
4889,_PART SECOND_,"And fiercely he to the angels called,"
4890,_PART SECOND_,"""Do you dare to claim him still?"
4891,_PART SECOND_,"Then come, for the scales are in my hand,"
4892,_PART SECOND_,"We will weigh the good and ill."""
4893,_PART SECOND_,
4894,_PART SECOND_,"And into the nearest scale he threw,"
4895,_PART SECOND_,"As he spoke, a parchment roll,"
4896,_PART SECOND_,With on it a note of every sin
4897,_PART SECOND_,That had stained the parting soul.
4898,_PART SECOND_,
4899,_PART SECOND_,"’T was closely written, without, within,"
4900,_PART SECOND_,And the balance downward flew
4901,_PART SECOND_,"And struck the ground with a blow, as though"
4902,_PART SECOND_,It would break the pavement through.
4903,_PART SECOND_,
4904,_PART SECOND_,"""He is ours forever,"" the demons said,"
4905,_PART SECOND_,"""If justice the world controls;"
4906,_PART SECOND_,"For sins so heavy do on him lie,"
4907,_PART SECOND_,They would sink a hundred souls!
4908,_PART SECOND_,
4909,_PART SECOND_,"""Come, hasten, angels, the time is short,"
4910,_PART SECOND_,And words are of no avail;
4911,_PART SECOND_,"Come, bring the note of your friend’s good deeds,"
4912,_PART SECOND_,"To lay in the empty scale."""
4913,_PART SECOND_,
4914,_PART SECOND_,"The angels searched, but they searched in vain,"
4915,_PART SECOND_,There was no good deed to bring;
4916,_PART SECOND_,"In all that ever that hand had done,"
4917,_PART SECOND_,They could find no worthy thing.
4918,_PART SECOND_,
4919,_PART SECOND_,"A taunting shout from the demons broke,"
4920,_PART SECOND_,And each hard malignant face
4921,_PART SECOND_,With joy and triumph was all aflame;
4922,_PART SECOND_,"But the angels held their place,"
4923,_PART SECOND_,
4924,_PART SECOND_,Though dimness fell like a passing cloud
4925,_PART SECOND_,On their pure and holy light;
4926,_PART SECOND_,"And if ever angel eyes have tears,"
4927,_PART SECOND_,There were some in theirs that night.
4928,_PART SECOND_,
4929,_PART SECOND_,"But he who had been the first to speak,"
4930,_PART SECOND_,"With a glimmering hope possessed,"
4931,_PART SECOND_,"Still sought some good that would turn the scale,"
4932,_PART SECOND_,Though it seemed a useless quest.
4933,_PART SECOND_,
4934,_PART SECOND_,"He saw the handkerchief where it lay,"
4935,_PART SECOND_,"And he raised it off the bed,"
4936,_PART SECOND_,"All wet and clinging, and steeped in tears"
4937,_PART SECOND_,That the dying eyes had shed.
4938,_PART SECOND_,
4939,_PART SECOND_,"He turned around, but his face was pale,"
4940,_PART SECOND_,As the last poor chance he tried;
4941,_PART SECOND_,"He laid it down in the empty scale,"
4942,_PART SECOND_,"And he said, ""Let God decide!"""
4943,_PART SECOND_,
4944,_PART SECOND_,"When, lo! it fell till it touched the earth,"
4945,_PART SECOND_,And the demons stood dismayed;
4946,_PART SECOND_,"It seemed so little and light a thing,"
4947,_PART SECOND_,But it all his sins outweighed.
4948,_PART SECOND_,
4949,_PART SECOND_,But who shall ever the anger tell
4950,_PART SECOND_,"Of that black and hateful band,"
4951,_PART SECOND_,"When most in triumph they felt secure,"
4952,_PART SECOND_,The prey had escaped their hand.
4953,_PART SECOND_,
4954,_PART SECOND_,"They stood one moment in speechless rage,"
4955,_PART SECOND_,"And then, with a fearful sound"
4956,_PART SECOND_,"Of shrieks and curses and rattling chains,"
4957,_PART SECOND_,They vanished beneath the ground.
4958,_PART SECOND_,
4959,_PART SECOND_,"Then holy peace on the chamber fell,"
4960,_PART SECOND_,Till it flooded all the air;
4961,_PART SECOND_,"The angels praised and they thanked the Lord,"
4962,_PART SECOND_,Who so late had heard their prayer.
4963,_PART SECOND_,
4964,_PART SECOND_,"And their clouded glory shone again,"
4965,_PART SECOND_,"With a clear celestial ray,"
4966,_PART SECOND_,"As the trembling soul, which that moment passed,"
4967,_PART SECOND_,They bore in their arms away.
4968,_PART SECOND_,
4969,_PART SECOND_,"Then through the room, as they took their flight,"
4970,_PART SECOND_,"Did a flood of music stream,"
4971,_PART SECOND_,"So loud, so sweet, and so close at hand,"
4972,_PART SECOND_,That it waked him from his dream.
4973,_PART SECOND_,
4974,_PART SECOND_,He looked around; there was nothing stirred
4975,_PART SECOND_,"In the empty, moonlit room,"
4976,_PART SECOND_,"Where a faint, sweet odour filled the air"
4977,_PART SECOND_,From the orange-trees in bloom.
4978,_PART SECOND_,
4979,_PART SECOND_,And the notes divine he had thought to hear
4980,_PART SECOND_,Were only the liquid flow
4981,_PART SECOND_,"Of a nightingale’s song, that came up clear"
4982,_PART SECOND_,From the garden just below.
4983,_PART SECOND_,
4984,_PART SECOND_,"Then up from his seat the doctor rose,"
4985,_PART SECOND_,And he stood beside the bed;
4986,_PART SECOND_,"He knew, when he touched the quiet hand,"
4987,_PART SECOND_,That the poor brigand was dead.
4988,_PART SECOND_,
4989,_PART SECOND_,"The handkerchief on the pillow lay,"
4990,_PART SECOND_,"But its weary use was o’er,"
4991,_PART SECOND_,"And he raised it, heavy and wet with tears,"
4992,_PART SECOND_,From the eyes that could weep no more.
4993,_PART SECOND_,
4994,_PART SECOND_,
4995,_PART SECOND_,
4996,_PART SECOND_,
4997,_PART SECOND_,
4998,_PART SECOND_,
4999,_PART SECOND_,
5000,_PART SECOND_,
