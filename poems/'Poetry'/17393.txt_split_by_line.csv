56,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
57,INTRODUCTION,
58,INTRODUCTION,"Thirteen years after the publication, in 1855, of the Poems, in two"
59,INTRODUCTION,"volumes, entitled ""Men and Women,"" Browning reviewed his work and"
60,INTRODUCTION,made an interesting reclassification of it.  He separated the
61,INTRODUCTION,simpler pieces of a lyric or epic cast--such rhymed presentations
62,INTRODUCTION,"of an emotional moment, for example, as ""Mesmerism"" and ""A Woman's"
63,INTRODUCTION,"Last Word,"" or the picturesque rhymed verse telling a story of an"
64,INTRODUCTION,"experience, such as ""Childe Roland"" and ""The Statue and the"
65,INTRODUCTION,"Bust""--from their more complex companions, which were almost"
66,INTRODUCTION,"altogether in blank verse, and, in general, markedly personified a"
67,INTRODUCTION,"typical man in his environment, a Cleon or Fra Lippo, a Rudel or a"
68,INTRODUCTION,Blougram.  These boldly sculptured figures he set apart from the
69,INTRODUCTION,others as the fit components of the more closely related group which
70,INTRODUCTION,"ever since has constituted the division now known as ""Men and"
71,INTRODUCTION,"Women."""
72,INTRODUCTION,
73,INTRODUCTION,Possibly the poet took some pleasure in thus bringing to confusion
74,INTRODUCTION,"those critics who, beginning first to take any notice of his work"
75,INTRODUCTION,"after the issue of these volumes of 1855, discovered therein poems"
76,INTRODUCTION,they praised chiefly by means of contrasting them with foregoing
77,INTRODUCTION,work they found unnoticeable and later work they declared
78,INTRODUCTION,"inscrutable.  Their bland discrimination, at any rate, in favor of"
79,INTRODUCTION,"""Men and Women"" became henceforth inapplicable, since the poet not"
80,INTRODUCTION,only cast out from the division they elected to honor the little
81,INTRODUCTION,"lyrical pieces that caught their eye, but also brought to the front,"
82,INTRODUCTION,from his earlier neglected work of the same kind as the monologues
83,INTRODUCTION,"retained, his Johannes Agricola of 1836, Pictor Ignotus of 1845, and"
84,INTRODUCTION,"Rudel of 1842. Later criticism, moreover, that even yet assumes to"
85,INTRODUCTION,"ring the old changes of discrimination against everything but ""Men"
86,INTRODUCTION,"and Women,"" is made not merely inapplicable by this re-arrangement,"
87,INTRODUCTION,"but uninformed, a meaningless echo of a borrowed opinion which has"
88,INTRODUCTION,had the very ground from under it shifted.
89,INTRODUCTION,
90,INTRODUCTION,The self-criticism of which this re-arrangement gives a hint is more
91,INTRODUCTION,valuable.
92,INTRODUCTION,
93,INTRODUCTION,"All the shorter poems accumulated up to this period, various as they"
94,INTRODUCTION,"are in theme and metrical form, are uniform in the fashioning of"
95,INTRODUCTION,their contour and color. As soon as this underlying uniformity of
96,INTRODUCTION,make is recognized it may be seen to be the coloring and relief
97,INTRODUCTION,"belonging to any sort of poetic material, whether ordinarily"
98,INTRODUCTION,"accounted dramatic material or not, which is imaginatively"
99,INTRODUCTION,externalized and made concrete. This peculiarity of make Browning
100,INTRODUCTION,early acknowledged in his estimate of his shorter poems as
101,INTRODUCTION,"characteristic of his touch, when he called his lyrics and romances"
102,INTRODUCTION,dramatic. He became consciously sensitive later to slight variations
103,INTRODUCTION,effected by his manipulation in shape and shade which it yet takes a
104,INTRODUCTION,"little thought to discern, even after his own redivision of his"
105,INTRODUCTION,work has given the clew to his self-judgments.
106,INTRODUCTION,
107,INTRODUCTION,"Not only events, deeds, and characters--the usual subject-matter"
108,INTRODUCTION,"moulded and irradiated by dramatic power--but thoughts, impressions,"
109,INTRODUCTION,"experiences, impulses, no matter how spiritualized or complex or"
110,INTRODUCTION,"mobile, are transfused with the enlivening light of his creative"
111,INTRODUCTION,energy in his shorter poems. Perhaps the very path struck out
112,INTRODUCTION,through them by the poet in his re-division may be traced between
113,INTRODUCTION,the leaves silently closing together again behind him if it be
114,INTRODUCTION,noticed that among these poems there are some with footholds firmly
115,INTRODUCTION,rooted in the earth and others whose proper realm is air. These have
116,INTRODUCTION,"wings for alighting, for flitting thither and hither, or for"
117,INTRODUCTION,pursuing some sudden rapt whirl of flight in Heaven's face at
118,INTRODUCTION,fancy's bidding. They are certainly not less original than those
119,INTRODUCTION,"other solider, earth-fast poems, but they are less unique. Being"
120,INTRODUCTION,"motived in transient fancy, they are more akin to poems by other"
121,INTRODUCTION,"hands, and could be classed more readily with them by any observer,"
122,INTRODUCTION,"despite all differences, as little poetic romances or as a species"
123,INTRODUCTION,of lyric.
124,INTRODUCTION,
125,INTRODUCTION,"They were probably first found praiseworthy, not only because they"
126,INTRODUCTION,"were simpler, but because, being more like work already understood"
127,INTRODUCTION,"and approved, adventurous criticism was needed to taste their"
128,INTRODUCTION,"quality. The other longer poems in blank verse, graver and more"
129,INTRODUCTION,"dignified, yet even more vivid, and far more life-encompassing,"
130,INTRODUCTION,"which bore the rounded impress of the living human being, instead of"
131,INTRODUCTION,the shadowy motion of the lively human fancy--these are the birth of
132,INTRODUCTION,a process of imaginative brooding upon the development of man by
133,INTRODUCTION,"means of individuality throughout the slow, unceasing flow of human"
134,INTRODUCTION,history. Browning evidently grew aware that whatever these poems of
135,INTRODUCTION,"personality might prove to be worth to the world, these were the"
136,INTRODUCTION,"ones deserving of a place apart, under the early title of ""Men and"
137,INTRODUCTION,"Women,"" which he thought especially suited to the more roundly"
138,INTRODUCTION,modelled and distinctively colored exemplars of his peculiar
139,INTRODUCTION,faculty.
140,INTRODUCTION,
141,INTRODUCTION,"In his next following collection, under the similar descriptive"
142,INTRODUCTION,"title of ""Dramatis Personae,"" he added to this class of work,"
143,INTRODUCTION,"shaping in the mould of blank verse mainly used for ""Men and Women"""
144,INTRODUCTION,"his personifications of the Medium Mr. Sludge, the embryo theologian"
145,INTRODUCTION,"Caliban, the ripened mystical saint of ""A Death in the Desert"";"
146,INTRODUCTION,"while Abt Vogler, the creative musician, Rabbi ben Ezra, the"
147,INTRODUCTION,"intuitional philosopher, and the chastened adept in loving, James"
148,INTRODUCTION,"Lee's wife, although held within the embrace of their maker's"
149,INTRODUCTION,"dramatic conception of them, as persons of his stage, were made to"
150,INTRODUCTION,pour out their speech in rhyme as Johannes Agricola in the earlier
151,INTRODUCTION,"volume uttered his creed and Rudel his love-message, as if the heat"
152,INTRODUCTION,of their emotion-moved personality required such an outlet.  Some
153,INTRODUCTION,"such general notion as this of the scope of this volume, and of the"
154,INTRODUCTION,"design of the poet in the construction, classification, and orderly"
155,INTRODUCTION,arrangement of so much of his briefer work as is here contained
156,INTRODUCTION,seems to be borne out upon a closer examination.  On the threshold
157,INTRODUCTION,of this new poetic world of personality stands the Poet of the poem
158,INTRODUCTION,"significantly called ""Transcendentalism,"" who is speaking to another"
159,INTRODUCTION,"poet about the too easily obvious, metaphor-bare philosophy of his"
160,INTRODUCTION,opus in twelve books.  That the admonishing poet is stationed there
161,INTRODUCTION,at the very door-sill of the Gallery of Men and Women is surely not
162,INTRODUCTION,"accidental, even if Browning's habit of plotting his groups of poems"
163,INTRODUCTION,symmetrically by opening with a prologue-poem sounding the right
164,INTRODUCTION,"key, and rounding the theme with an epilogue, did not tend to prove"
165,INTRODUCTION,"it intentional. It is an open secret that the last poem in ""Men and"
166,INTRODUCTION,"Women,"" for instance, is an epilogue of autobiographical interest,"
167,INTRODUCTION,"gathering up the foregoing strains of his lyre, for a few last"
168,INTRODUCTION,"chords, in so intimate a way that the actual fall of the fingers may"
169,INTRODUCTION,"be felt, the pausing smile seen, as the performer turns towards the"
170,INTRODUCTION,"one who inspired ""One Word More.""  The appropriateness of"
171,INTRODUCTION,"""Transcendentalism"" as a prologue need be no more of a secret than"
172,INTRODUCTION,"that of ""One Word More"" as an epilogue, although it is left to"
173,INTRODUCTION,"betray itself.  Other poets writing on the poet, Emerson for"
174,INTRODUCTION,"example, and Tennyson, place the outright plain name of their"
175,INTRODUCTION,"thought at the head of their verses, without any attempt to make"
176,INTRODUCTION,their titles dress their parts and keep as thoroughly true to their
177,INTRODUCTION,roles as the poems themselves.  But a complete impersonation of his
178,INTRODUCTION,thought in name and style as well as matter is characteristic of
179,INTRODUCTION,"Browning, and his personified poets playing their parts together in"
180,INTRODUCTION,"""Transcendentalism"" combine to exhibit a little masque exemplifying"
181,INTRODUCTION,their writer's view of the Poet as veritably as if he had named it
182,INTRODUCTION,"specifically ""The Poet.""  One poet shows the other, and brings him"
183,INTRODUCTION,visibly forward; but even in such a morsel of dramatic workmanship
184,INTRODUCTION,"as this, fifty-one lines all told, there is the complexity and"
185,INTRODUCTION,"involution of life itself, and, as ever in Browning's monologues,"
186,INTRODUCTION,over the shoulder of the poet more obviously portrayed peers as
187,INTRODUCTION,livingly the face of the poet portraying him. And this one--the
188,INTRODUCTION,"admonishing poet--is set there with his ""sudden rose,"" as if to"
189,INTRODUCTION,indicate with that symbol of poetic magic what kind of spell was
190,INTRODUCTION,sought to be exercised by their maker to conjure up in his house of
191,INTRODUCTION,song the figures that people its niches. Could a poem be imagined
192,INTRODUCTION,"more cunningly devised to reveal a typical poetic personality, and a"
193,INTRODUCTION,"typical theory of poetic method, through its way of revealing"
194,INTRODUCTION,another?  What poet could have composed it but one who himself
195,INTRODUCTION,employed the dramatic method of causing the abstract to be
196,INTRODUCTION,"realizable through the concrete image of it, instead of the contrary"
197,INTRODUCTION,mode of seeking to divest the objective of its concrete form in
198,INTRODUCTION,order to lay bare its abstract essence? This opposite theory of the
199,INTRODUCTION,"poetic function is precisely the Boehme mode, against which the"
200,INTRODUCTION,"veiled dramatic poet, who is speaking in favor of the Halberstadtian"
201,INTRODUCTION,"magic, admonishes his brother, while he himself in practical"
202,INTRODUCTION,substantiation of his theory of poetics brings bodily in sight the
203,INTRODUCTION,"boy-face above the winged harp, vivified and beautiful himself,"
204,INTRODUCTION,although his poem is but a shapeless mist.
205,INTRODUCTION,
206,INTRODUCTION,"Not directly, then, but indirectly, as the dramatic poet ever"
207,INTRODUCTION,"reveals himself, does the sophisticated face of the subtle poet of"
208,INTRODUCTION,"""Men and Women"" appear as the source of power behind both of the"
209,INTRODUCTION,"poets of this poem, prepossessing the reader of the verity and"
210,INTRODUCTION,beauty of the theory of poetic art therein exemplified.  Such an
211,INTRODUCTION,"interpretation of ""Transcendentalism,"" and such a conception of it"
212,INTRODUCTION,"as a key to the art of the volume it opens, chimes in harmoniously"
213,INTRODUCTION,"with the note sounded in the next following poem, ""How it Strikes a"
214,INTRODUCTION,"Contemporary.""  Here again a typical poet is personified, not,"
215,INTRODUCTION,"however, by means of his own poetic way of seeing, but of the"
216,INTRODUCTION,"prosaic way in which he is seen by a contemporary, the whole, of"
217,INTRODUCTION,"course, being poetically seen and presented by the"
218,INTRODUCTION,"over-poet. Browning himself, and in such a manifold way that the"
219,INTRODUCTION,reader is enabled to conceive as vividly of the talker and his
220,INTRODUCTION,mental atmosphere and social background--the people and habitudes of
221,INTRODUCTION,the good old town of Valladolid--as of the betalked-of Corregidor
222,INTRODUCTION,himself; while by the totality of these concrete images an
223,INTRODUCTION,impression is conveyed of the dramatic mode of poetic expression
224,INTRODUCTION,which is far more convincing than any explicit theoretic statement
225,INTRODUCTION,"of it could be, because so humanly animated."
226,INTRODUCTION,
227,INTRODUCTION,"""Artemis Prologizes"" seems to have been selected to close this"
228,INTRODUCTION,"little opening sequence of poems on the poet, because that fragment"
229,INTRODUCTION,of a larger projected work could find place here almost as if it
230,INTRODUCTION,were a poet's exercise in blank verse. Its smooth and spacious
231,INTRODUCTION,"rhythm, flawless and serene as the distant Greek myth of the hero"
232,INTRODUCTION,"and the goddess it celebrates, is in striking contrast with the"
233,INTRODUCTION,"rougher, but brighter and more humanly colloquial blank verse of"
234,INTRODUCTION,"""Bishop Blougram's Apology,"" for example, or the stiff carefulness"
235,INTRODUCTION,"of the ""Epistle"" of Karshish.  It might alone suffice, by comparison"
236,INTRODUCTION,"with the metrical craftsmanship of the other poems of ""Men and"
237,INTRODUCTION,"Women,"" to assure the observant reader that never was a good workman"
238,INTRODUCTION,more baselessly accused of metrical carelessness than the poet who
239,INTRODUCTION,designedly varies his complicated verse-effects to suit every inner
240,INTRODUCTION,impulse belonging to his dramatic subject.  A golden finish being in
241,INTRODUCTION,"place in this statuesque, ""Hyperion""-like monologue of Artemis,"
242,INTRODUCTION,"behold here it is, and none the less perfect because not merely the"
243,INTRODUCTION,outcome of the desire to produce a polished piece of poetic
244,INTRODUCTION,mechanism.
245,INTRODUCTION,
246,INTRODUCTION,"Browning, perhaps, linked his next poem, ""The Strange Medical"
247,INTRODUCTION,"Experience of Karshish, the Arab Physician,"" with the calm"
248,INTRODUCTION,"prologizing of the Hellenic goddess, by association of the ""wise"
249,INTRODUCTION,"pharmacies"" of AEsculapius, with the inquisitive sagacity of"
250,INTRODUCTION,"Karshish, ""the not-incurious in God's handiwork.""  By this ordering"
251,INTRODUCTION,"of the poems, the reader may now enjoy, at any rate, the contrasts"
252,INTRODUCTION,between three historic phases of wisdom in bodily ills: the phase
253,INTRODUCTION,presented in the dependence of the old Greek healer upon simple
254,INTRODUCTION,"physical effects, soothing ""with lavers the torn brow,"" and laying"
255,INTRODUCTION,"""the stripes and jagged ends of flesh even once more""; and the"
256,INTRODUCTION,"phases typified, on the one side, by the ingenious Arab, sire of the"
257,INTRODUCTION,"modern scientist, whose patient correlation of facts and studious,"
258,INTRODUCTION,sceptical scrutiny of cause and effect are caught in the bud in the
259,INTRODUCTION,"diagnosis transmitted by Karshish to Abib, and, on the other side,"
260,INTRODUCTION,"by the Nazarene physician, whose inspired secret of summoning out of"
261,INTRODUCTION,the believing soul of man the power to control his body--so baffled
262,INTRODUCTION,"and fascinated Karshish, drawing his attention in Lazarus to just"
263,INTRODUCTION,that connection of the known physical with the unknown psychical
264,INTRODUCTION,nature which is still mystically alluring the curiosity of
265,INTRODUCTION,investigators.
266,INTRODUCTION,
267,INTRODUCTION,"From the childlike, over-idealizing mood of Lazarus toward the God"
268,INTRODUCTION,"who had succored him, inducing in him so fatalistic an indifference"
269,INTRODUCTION,"to human concerns, there is but a step to the rapture of absolute"
270,INTRODUCTION,theology expressed in the person of Johannes Agricola.  Such poems
271,INTRODUCTION,as these put before the cool gaze of the present century the very
272,INTRODUCTION,men of the elder day of religion. Their robes shine with an
273,INTRODUCTION,"unearthly light, and their abstracted eyes are hypnotized by the"
274,INTRODUCTION,effulgence of their own haloes.  Yet the poet never fails to
275,INTRODUCTION,"insinuate some naive foible in their personification, a numbness of"
276,INTRODUCTION,"the heart or an archaism of soul, which reveals the possessed one as"
277,INTRODUCTION,"but a human brother, after all, shaped by his environment, and"
278,INTRODUCTION,embodying the spirit of an historic epoch out of which the current
279,INTRODUCTION,of modern life is still streaming.
280,INTRODUCTION,
281,INTRODUCTION,The group of art poems which follows similarly presents a dramatic
282,INTRODUCTION,synthesis of the art of the Renaissance as represented by three
283,INTRODUCTION,"types of painters. The religious devotion of the monastic painter,"
284,INTRODUCTION,"whose ecstatic spirit breathes in ""Pictor Ignotus,"" probably gives"
285,INTRODUCTION,this poem its place adjoining Agricola and Lazarus.  His artist's
286,INTRODUCTION,hankering to create that beauty to bless the world with which his
287,INTRODUCTION,"soul refrains from grossly satisfying, unites the poem with the two"
288,INTRODUCTION,"following ones.  In the first of these the realistic artist, Fra"
289,INTRODUCTION,"Lippo, is graphically pictured personally ushering in the high noon"
290,INTRODUCTION,"of the Italian efflorescence. In the second, the gray of that day of"
291,INTRODUCTION,art is silvering the self-painted portrait of the prematurely
292,INTRODUCTION,"frigid and facile formalist, Andrea del Sarto.  In ""Pictor Ignotus"""
293,INTRODUCTION,not only the personality of the often unknown and unnamed
294,INTRODUCTION,"painting-brother of the monasteries is made clear, but also the"
295,INTRODUCTION,nature of his beautiful cold art and the enslavement of both art and
296,INTRODUCTION,"personality to ecclesiastical beliefs and ideals. In ""Fra Lippo"
297,INTRODUCTION,"Lippi"" not alone the figure of the frolicsome monk appears caught in"
298,INTRODUCTION,"his pleasure-loving escapade, amid that picturesque knot of"
299,INTRODUCTION,"alert-witted Florentine guards, ready to appreciate all the good"
300,INTRODUCTION,points in his story of his life and the protection the arms of the
301,INTRODUCTION,"Church and the favor of the Medici have afforded his genius, but,"
302,INTRODUCTION,"furthermore, is illustrated the irresistible tendency of the"
303,INTRODUCTION,art-impulse to expand beyond the bounds set for it either by laws of
304,INTRODUCTION,"Church or art itself, and to find beauty wheresoever in life it"
305,INTRODUCTION,"chooses to turn the light of its gaze. So, also, in ""Andrea del"
306,INTRODUCTION,"Sarto,"" the easy cleverness of the unaspiring craftsman is not"
307,INTRODUCTION,embodied apart from the abject relationship which made his very soul
308,INTRODUCTION,"a bond-slave to the gross mandates of ""the Cousin's whistle.""  Yet"
309,INTRODUCTION,in all three poems the biographic and historic conditions
310,INTRODUCTION,contributing toward the individualizing of each artist are so
311,INTRODUCTION,"unobtrusively epitomized and vitally blended, that, while scarcely"
312,INTRODUCTION,any item of specific study of the art and artists of the Renaissance
313,INTRODUCTION,would be out of place in illustrating the essential truth of the
314,INTRODUCTION,"portraiture and assisting in the better appreciation of the poem,"
315,INTRODUCTION,there is no detail of the workmanship which does not fall into the
316,INTRODUCTION,background as a mere accessory to the dominant figure through whose
317,INTRODUCTION,relationship to his art his station in the past is made clear.
318,INTRODUCTION,
319,INTRODUCTION,"This sort of dramatic synthesis of a salient, historical epoch is"
320,INTRODUCTION,again strikingly disclosed in the following poem of the Renaissance
321,INTRODUCTION,"period, ""The Bishop Orders his Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church.""  In"
322,INTRODUCTION,"this, again, the art-connoisseurship of the prelacy, so important"
323,INTRODUCTION,"an element in the Italian movement towards art-expression, is"
324,INTRODUCTION,revealed to the life in the beauty-loving personality of the dying
325,INTRODUCTION,"bishop.  And by means, also, of his social ties with his nephews,"
326,INTRODUCTION,"called closer than they wish about him now; with her whom ""men would"
327,INTRODUCTION,"have to be their mother once""; with old Gandolf, whom he fancies"
328,INTRODUCTION,leering at him from his onion-stone tomb; and with all those strong
329,INTRODUCTION,"desires of the time for the delight of being envied, for marble"
330,INTRODUCTION,"baths and horses and brown Greek manuscripts and mistresses, the"
331,INTRODUCTION,"seeds of human decay planted in the plot of Time, known as the"
332,INTRODUCTION,"Central Renaissance, by the same lingering fleshliness and"
333,INTRODUCTION,"self-destroying self-indulgence as was at home in pagan days, are"
334,INTRODUCTION,livingly exposed to the historic sense.
335,INTRODUCTION,
336,INTRODUCTION,"Is the modern prelate portrayed in ""Bishop Blougram's Apology,"" with"
337,INTRODUCTION,"all his bland subtlety, complex culture, and ripened perceptions,"
338,INTRODUCTION,"distant as the nineteenth century from the sixteenth, very different"
339,INTRODUCTION,"at bottom from his Renaissance brother, in respect to his native"
340,INTRODUCTION,hankering for the pleasure of estimation above his fellows?
341,INTRODUCTION,"Gigadibs is his Gandolf, whom he would craftily overtop.  He is the"
342,INTRODUCTION,one raised for the time above the commonalty by his criticism of the
343,INTRODUCTION,"bishop, to whom the prelate would fain show how little he was to be"
344,INTRODUCTION,"despised, how far more honored and powerful he was among men.  As"
345,INTRODUCTION,"for Gigadibs, it is to be noticed that Browning quietly makes him do"
346,INTRODUCTION,more than leer enviously at his complacent competitor from a
347,INTRODUCTION,"tomb-top.  The ""sudden healthy vehemence"" that struck him and made"
348,INTRODUCTION,"him start to test his first plough in a new world, and read his last"
349,INTRODUCTION,chapter of St. John to better purpose than towards
350,INTRODUCTION,"self-glorification beyond his fellows, is a parable of the more"
351,INTRODUCTION,profitable life to be found in following the famous injunction of
352,INTRODUCTION,"that chapter in John's Gospel, ""Feed my sheep!"" than in causing"
353,INTRODUCTION,"those sheep to motion one, as the bishop would have his obsequious"
354,INTRODUCTION,"wethers of the flock motion him, to the choice places of the sward."
355,INTRODUCTION,
356,INTRODUCTION,"So, as vivid a picture of the materialism and monopolizing of the"
357,INTRODUCTION,present century sowing seeds of decay and self-destruction in the
358,INTRODUCTION,"movement of this age toward love of the truth, of the beauty of"
359,INTRODUCTION,"genuineness in character and earnestness in aim, is portrayed"
360,INTRODUCTION,"through the realistic personality of the great modern bishop, in his"
361,INTRODUCTION,"easy-smiling after-dinner talk with Gigadibs, the literary man, as"
362,INTRODUCTION,is presented of the Central Renaissance period in the companion
363,INTRODUCTION,picture of the Bishop of Saint Praxed's.
364,INTRODUCTION,
365,INTRODUCTION,"In Cleon, the man of composite art and culture, the last ripe"
366,INTRODUCTION,"fruitage of Greek development, is personified and brought into"
367,INTRODUCTION,"contact, at the moment of the dawn of Christianity in Europe, with"
368,INTRODUCTION,the ardent impulse the Christian ideal of spiritual life supplied to
369,INTRODUCTION,human civilization. How close the wise and broad Greek culture came
370,INTRODUCTION,"to being all-sufficing, capable of effecting almost enough of"
371,INTRODUCTION,"impetus for the aspiring progress of the world, and yet how much it"
372,INTRODUCTION,lacked a warmer element essential to be engrafted upon its lofty
373,INTRODUCTION,"beauty, the reader, upon whose imaginative vision the personality of"
374,INTRODUCTION,"Cleon rises, can scarcely help but feel."
375,INTRODUCTION,
376,INTRODUCTION,The aesthetic and religious or philosophical interests vitally
377,INTRODUCTION,"conceived and blended, which link together so many of the main poems"
378,INTRODUCTION,"of ""Men and Women,"" close with ""Cleon.""  Rudel, the troubadour,"
379,INTRODUCTION,"presenting, in the self-abandonment of his offering of love to the"
380,INTRODUCTION,"Lady of Tripoli, an impersonation of the chivalric love"
381,INTRODUCTION,"characteristic of the Provencal life of the twelfth century,"
382,INTRODUCTION,"intervenes, appropriately, last of all, between the preceding poems"
383,INTRODUCTION,"and the epilogue, which devotes heart and brain of the poet himself,"
384,INTRODUCTION,"with the creatures of his hand, to his ""Moon of Poets."""
385,INTRODUCTION,
386,INTRODUCTION,"As these poetic creations now stand, they all seem, upon"
387,INTRODUCTION,"examination, to incarnate the full-bodied life of distinctive types"
388,INTRODUCTION,"of men, centred amid their relations with other men within a"
389,INTRODUCTION,"specific social environment, and fulfilling the possibilities for"
390,INTRODUCTION,"such unique, dramatic syntheses as were revealed but partially or in"
391,INTRODUCTION,embryo here and there among the other shorter poems of this period

402,INTRODUCTION,what does it matter that the advantage gained by nicely selecting
403,INTRODUCTION,"the poems properly belonging together, both in conception and"

414,INTRODUCTION,"now, is still near enough at hand in the revised order to account"
415,INTRODUCTION,for the allusion. These are all trifles--mere sins against literal
416,INTRODUCTION,accuracy. But the discrepancy in the title occasioned by the absence
417,INTRODUCTION,"of women is of more importance.  It is of especial interest, in"

490,NOTES,"""Transcendentalism"" is a criticism, placed in the mouth of a poet,"
491,NOTES,"of another poet, whose manner of singing is prosaic, because it"
492,NOTES,"seeks to transcend (or penetrate beyond) phenomena, by divesting"
493,NOTES,poetic expression of those concrete embodiments which enable it to
494,NOTES,appeal to the senses and imagination.  Instead of bare abstractions
495,NOTES,"being suited to the developed mind, it is the primitive mind, which,"
496,NOTES,"like Boehme's, has the merely metaphysical turn, and expects to"
497,NOTES,discover the unincarnate absolute essence of things. The maturer
498,NOTES,"mind craves the vitalizing method of the artist who, like the"
499,NOTES,"magician of Halberstadt, recreates things bodily in all their"
500,NOTES,beautiful vivid wholeness.  Yet the poet who sincerely holds so
501,NOTES,fragmentary a conception of art is himself a poem to the poet who
502,NOTES,holds the larger view.  His boy-face singing to God above his

1327,NOTES,"""Johannes Agricola in Meditation"" presents the doctrine of"
1328,NOTES,predestination as it appears to a devout and poetic soul whose
1329,NOTES,conviction of the truth of such a doctrine has the strength of a
1330,NOTES,divine revelation. Those elected for God's love can do nothing to
1331,NOTES,"weaken it, those not elected can do nothing to gain it, but it is"
1332,NOTES,"not his to reason why; indeed, he could not praise a god whose ways"

1337,NOTES,"antinomian, because it rejected the Law of the Old Testament as of"
1338,NOTES,no use under the Gospel dispensation.  In a note accompanying the
1339,NOTES,"first publication of this poem, Browning quotes from ""The Dictionary"
1340,NOTES,"of All Religions"" (1704): ""They say that good works do not further,"
1341,NOTES,"nor evil works hinder salvation; that the child of God cannot sin,"
1342,NOTES,"that God never chastiseth him, that murder, drunkenness, etc., are"
1343,NOTES,"sins in the wicked but not in him, that the child of grace being"
1344,NOTES,"once assured of salvation, afterwards never doubteth . . . that God"
1345,NOTES,"doth not love any man for his holiness, that sanctification is no"
1346,NOTES,"evidence of justification.""  Though many antinomians taught thus,"
1347,NOTES,"says George Willis Cooke in his ""Browning Guide Book,"" it does not"
1348,NOTES,"correctly represent the position of Agricola, who in reality held"
1349,NOTES,"moral obligations to be incumbent upon the Christian, but for"
1350,NOTES,guidance in these he found in the New Testament all the principles
1351,NOTES,and motives necessary.

1581,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,For admonition from the hunger-pinch.
1582,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I had a store of such remarks, be sure,"
1583,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Which, after I found leisure, turned to use."
1584,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I drew men's faces on my copy-books,"
1585,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Scrawled them within the antiphonary's marge,             130"
1586,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes,"
1587,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and B's,"
1588,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And made a string of pictures of the world
1589,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun,"
1590,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"On the wall, the bench, the door.  The monks looked black."
1591,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Nay,"" quoth the Prior, ""turn him out, d' ye say?"
1592,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,In no wise.  Lose a crow and catch a lark.
1593,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"What if at last we get our man of parts,"
1594,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"We Carmelites, like those Camaldolese"
1595,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And Preaching Friars, to do our church up fine            140"
1596,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And put the front on it that ought to be!"""
1597,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And hereupon he bade me daub away.
1598,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank,"
1599,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Never was such prompt disemburdening.
1600,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"First, every sort of monk, the black and white,"
1601,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I drew them, fat and lean : then, folk at church,"
1602,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,From good old gossips waiting to confess
1603,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends--"
1604,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot,"
1605,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there             150"
1606,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,With the little children round him in a row
1607,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Of admiration, half for his beard and half"
1608,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,For that white anger of his victim's son
1609,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm,"
1610,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Signing himself with the other because of Christ
1611,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,(Whose  sad face on the cross sees only this
1612,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,After the passion of a thousand years)
1613,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head,"
1614,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,(Which  the intense eyes looked through) came at eve
1615,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf,                160"
1616,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers
1617,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"(The  brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone,"
1618,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I painted all, then cried ""'T is ask and have;"
1619,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Choose, for more's ready!""--laid the ladder flat,"
1620,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And showed  my covered bit of cloister-wall.
1621,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The monks closed in a circle and praised loud
1622,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Till checked, taught what to see and not to see,"
1623,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Being simple bodies--""That's the very man!"
1624,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog!
1625,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,That woman's like the Prior's niece who comes             170
1626,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To care about his asthma: it's the life!"""
1627,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funked;
1628,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Their betters took their turn to see and say:
1629,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The Prior and the learned pulled a face
1630,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And stopped all that in no time.  ""How? what's here?"
1631,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all!"
1632,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Faces, arms, legs and bodies like the true"
1633,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,As much as pea and pea! it's devil's-game!
1634,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Your business is not to catch men with show,"
1635,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"With homage to the perishable clay,                       180"
1636,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"But lift them over it, ignore it all,"
1637,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh.
1638,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Your business is to paint the souls of men--
1639,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke . . . no, it's not . . ."
1640,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,It's vapor done up like a new-born babe--
1641,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,(In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth)
1642,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"It's . . . well, what matters talking, it's the soul!"
1643,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Give us no more of body than shows soul!
1644,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Here's Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God,"
1645,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,That sets us praising--why not stop with him?             190
1646,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head
1647,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"With wonder at lines, colors, and what not?"
1648,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Paint the soul, never mind the legs and arms!"
1649,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Rub all out, try at it a second time."
1650,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts,"
1651,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"She's just my niece . . . Herodias, I would say--"
1652,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off!
1653,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Have it all out!  ""Now,  is this sense, I ask?"
1654,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A fine way to paint soul, by painting body"
1655,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"So ill, the eye can't stop there, must go further         200"
1656,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And can't fare worse!  Thus, yellow does for white"
1657,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"When what you put for yellow's simply black,"
1658,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And any sort of meaning looks intense
1659,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,When all beside itself means and looks naught.
1660,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn,"
1661,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Left foot and right foot, go a double step,"
1662,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Make his flesh liker and his soul more like,"
1663,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Both in their order? Take the prettiest face,"
1664,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The Prior's niece . . . patron-saint--is it so pretty
1665,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You  can't discover if it means hope, fear,               210"
1666,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Sorrow or joy? won't beauty go with these?
1667,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue,"
1668,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash,"
1669,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And then add soul and heighten them three-fold?
1670,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Or say there's beauty with no soul at all--
1671,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,(I never saw it--put the case the same--)
1672,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"If you get simple beauty and naught else,"
1673,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You get about the best thing God invents:
1674,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed,"
1675,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Within yourself, when you return him thanks.              220"
1676,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Rub all out!  ""Well, well, there's my life, in short,"
1677,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And so the thing has gone on ever since.
1678,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I'm grown a man no doubt, I've broken bounds:"
1679,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You should not take a fellow eight years old
1680,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And make him swear to never kiss the girls.
1681,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I'm my own master, paint now as I please--"
1682,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house!"
1683,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front--"
1684,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Those great rings serve more purposes than just
1685,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse!                    230"
1686,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes"
1687,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work,"
1688,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The heads shake still--""It's art's decline, my son!"
1689,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You're not of the true painters, great and old;"
1690,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Brother Angelico's the man, you'll find;"
1691,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Brother Lorenzo stands his single peer:
1692,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Fag on at flesh, you'll never make the third!"""
1693,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"<Flower o' the pine,"
1694,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You keep your mistr . . . manners, and I'll stick to mine!>"
1695,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I'm not the third, then: bless us, they must know!        240"
1696,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Don't you think they're the likeliest to know,"
1697,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage,"
1698,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint"
1699,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,To please them--sometimes do and sometimes don't;
1700,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come"
1701,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints--"
1702,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A laugh, a cry, the business of the world--"
1703,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"<(Flower o' the peach,"
1704,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Death for us all, and his own life for each!)>"
1705,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over,            250"
1706,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The world and life's too big to pass for a dream,"
1707,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And I do these wild things in sheer despite,"
1708,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And play the fooleries you catch me at,"
1709,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"In pure rage!  The old mill-horse, out at grass"
1710,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so,"
1711,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Although the miller does not preach to him
1712,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The only good of grass is to make chaff.
1713,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,What would men have?  Do they like grass or no--
1714,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,May they or may n't they? all I want's the thing
1715,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Settled forever one way.  As it is,                       260"
1716,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You tell too many lies and hurt yourself:
1717,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You don't like what you only like too much,"
1718,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You do like what, if given you at your word,"
1719,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You find abundantly detestable.
1720,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"For me, I think I speak as I was taught;"
1721,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I always see the garden and God there
1722,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned,"
1723,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The value and significance of flesh,"
1724,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards,"
1725,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
1726,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You understand me: I'm a beast, I know.                   270"
1727,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"But see, now--why, I see as certainly"
1728,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"As that the morning-star's about to shine,"
1729,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,What will hap some day.  We've a youngster here
1730,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Comes  to our convent, studies what I do,"
1731,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Slouches and stares and lets no atom drop:
1732,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,His name is Guidi--he'll not mind the monks--
1733,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"They call him Hulking Tom, he lets them talk--"
1734,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"He picks my practice up--he'll paint apace,"
1735,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I hope so--though I never live so long,"
1736,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I know what's sure to follow.  You be judge!              280
1737,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You speak no Latin more than I, belike;"
1738,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"However, you're my  man, you've seen the world"
1739,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"--The  beauty and the wonder and the power,"
1740,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The shapes of things, their colors, lights and shades,"
1741,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Changes, surprises,--and God made it all!"
1742,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"--For what?  Do you feel thankful, ay or no,"
1743,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"For this fair town's face, yonder river's line,"
1744,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The mountain round it and the sky above,"
1745,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Much more the figures of man, woman, child,"
1746,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,These are the frame to? What's it all about?              290
1747,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To be passed over, despised? or dwelt upon,"
1748,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Wondered at? oh, this last of course!--you say."
1749,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,But why not do as well as say--paint these
1750,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Just as they are, careless what comes of it?"
1751,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"God's works--paint any one, and count it crime"
1752,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To let a truth slip.  Don't object, ""His works"
1753,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Are here already; nature is complete:
1754,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Suppose you reproduce her (which  you can't)
1755,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"There's no advantage! you must beat her, then."""
1756,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"For, don't you mark? we're made so that we love           300"
1757,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"First when we see them painted, things we have passed"
1758,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;
1759,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And so they are better, painted--better to us,"
1760,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Which is the same thing.  Art was given for that;
1761,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"God uses us to help each other so,"
1762,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lending our minds out.  Have you noticed, now,"
1763,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Your cullion's hanging face?  A bit of chalk,"
1764,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And trust me but you should, though! How much more,"
1765,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,If I drew higher things with the same truth!
1766,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"That were to take the Prior's pulpit-place,               310"
1767,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Interpret God to all of you! Oh, oh,"
1768,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,It makes me mad to see what men shall do
1769,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And we in our graves!  This world's no blot for us,"
1770,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good:"
1771,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,To find its meaning is my meat and drink.
1772,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Ay, but you don't so instigate to prayer!"""
1773,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Strikes in the Prior: ""when your meaning's plain"
1774,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"It does not say to folk--remember matins,"
1775,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Or, mind you fast next Friday!  ""Why, for this"
1776,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"What need of art at all?  A skull and bones,              320"
1777,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Two bits of stick nailed crosswise, or, what's best,"
1778,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A bell to chime the hour with, does as well."
1779,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I painted a Saint Laurence six months since
1780,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"At Prato, splashed the fresco in fine style:"
1781,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,""" How looks my painting, now the scaffold's down?"""
1782,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I ask a brother: ""Hugely,"" he returns--"
1783,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Already not one phiz of your three slaves"
1784,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Who turn the Deacon off his toasted side,"
1785,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"But's scratched and prodded to our heart's content,"
1786,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The pious people have so eased their own                  330
1787,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,With coming  to say prayers there in a rage:
1788,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,We get on fast to see the bricks beneath.
1789,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Expect another job this time next year,"
1790,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,For pity and religion grow i' the crowd--
1791,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Your painting serves its purpose!  Hang the fools!
1792,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
1793,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,--That is--you'll not mistake an idle word
1794,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Spoke in a huff by a poor monk.  God wot,"
1795,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Tasting the air this spicy night which turns
1796,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The unaccustomed head like Chianti wine!
1797,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Oh, the church knows! don't misreport me, now!            340"
1798,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,It's natural a poor monk out of bounds
1799,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Should have his apt word to excuse himself:
1800,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And hearken how I plot to make amends.
1801,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I have bethought me: I shall paint a piece
1802,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,". . . There's for you!  Give  me six months, then go, see"
1803,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Something in Sant' Ambrogio's!  Bless the nuns!
1804,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,They want a cast o' my office. I shall paint
1805,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"God in the midst.  Madonna and her babe,"
1806,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Ringed by a bowery flowery angel-brood,"
1807,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lilies and vestments and white faces, sweet               350"
1808,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,As puff on puff of grated orris-root
1809,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,When ladies crowd to Church at midsummer.
1810,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And then i' the front, of course a saint or two--"
1811,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Saint John, because he saves the Florentines,"
1812,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Saint Ambrose, who puts down in black and white"
1813,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The convent's friends and gives them a long day,"
1814,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And Job, I must have him there past mistake,"
1815,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The man of Uz (and Us without the z,"
1816,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Painters who need his patience).  Well, all these"
1817,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Secured at their devotion, up shall come                  360"
1818,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Out of a corner when you least expect,"
1819,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"As one by a dark stair into a great light,"
1820,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Music and talking, who but Lippo!  I!--"
1821,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Mazed, motionless and moonstruck--I'm the man!"
1822,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Back I shrink--what is this I see and hear?
1823,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I, caught up with my monk's-things by mistake,"
1824,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"My old serge gown and rope that goes all round,"
1825,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I, in this presence, this pure company!"
1826,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Where's a hole, where's a corner for escape?"
1827,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Then steps a sweet angelic slip of a thing                370
1828,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Forward, puts out a soft palm--""Not so fast!"""
1829,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"--Addresses the celestial presence, ""nay--"
1830,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"He made you and devised you, after all,"
1831,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Though he's none of you!  Could Saint John there draw--
1832,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,His camel-hair make up a painting-brush?
1833,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"We come to brother Lippo for all that,"
1834,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"<Iste perfecit opus.>""  So, all smile--"
1835,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I shuffle sideways with my blushing face
1836,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Under the cover of a hundred wings
1837,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Thrown like a spread of kirtles when you're gay           380
1838,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And play hot cockles, all the doors being shut,"
1839,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Till, wholly unexpected, in there pops"
1840,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The hothead husband!  Thus I scuttle off
1841,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To some safe bench behind, not letting go"
1842,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The palm of her, the little lily thing"
1843,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"That spoke the good word for me in the nick,"
1844,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Like the Prior's niece . . . Saint Lucy, I would say."
1845,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And so all's saved for me, and for the church"
1846,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A pretty picture gained.  Go, six months hence!"
1847,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Your hand, sir, and good-bye: no lights, no lights!       390"
1848,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The street's hushed, and I know my own way back,"
1849,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Don't fear me!  There's the gray beginning.  Zooks!

1853,NOTES,"""Fra Lippo Lippi"" is a dramatic monologue which incidentally conveys"
1854,NOTES,the whole story of the occurrence the poem starts from--the seizure
1855,NOTES,"of Fra Lippo by the City Guards, past midnight, in an equivocal"
1856,NOTES,"neighborhood--and the lively talk that arose thereupon, outlines the"
1857,NOTES,character and past life of the Florentine artist-monk (1412-1469)
1858,NOTES,and the subordinate personalities of the group of officers; and
1859,NOTES,makes all this contribute towards the presentation of Fra Lippo as a
1860,NOTES,type of the more realistic and secular artist of the Renaissance who
1861,NOTES,"valued flesh, and protested against the ascetic spirit which strove"
1862,NOTES,to isolate the soul.
1863,NOTES,
1864,NOTES,7. The Carmine: monastery of the Del Carmine friars.
1865,NOTES,

1871,NOTES,53. Flower o' the broom: of the many varieties of folk-songs in
1872,NOTES,Italy that which furnished Browning with a model for Lippo's songs
1873,NOTES,is called a stornello.  The name is variously derived.  Some take it
1874,NOTES,"as merely short for ritornillo; others derive it from a storno, to"
1875,NOTES,"sing against each other, because the peasants sing them at their"
1876,NOTES,"work, and as one ends a song, another caps it with a fresh one, and"
1877,NOTES,so on.  These stornelli consist of three lines. The first usually
1878,NOTES,"contains the name of a flower which sets the rhyme, and is five"
1879,NOTES,syllables long.  Then the love theme is told in two lines of eleven

2579,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2580,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Thus much conceded, still the first fact stays--"

2590,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"--That, my ideal never can include,"
2591,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Upon that element of truth and worth                       60
2592,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Never be based! for say they make me Pope--
2593,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,(They can't--suppose it for our argument!)
2594,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Why, there I'm at my tether's end, I've reached"
2595,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"My height, and not a height which pleases you:"
2596,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"An unbelieving Pope won't do, you say."
2597,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"It's like those eerie stories nurses tell,"
2598,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Of how some actor on a stage played Death,"
2599,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"With pasteboard crown, sham orb and tinselled dart,"
2600,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And called himself the monarch of the world;
2601,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Then, going in the tire-room afterward,                    70"
2602,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Because the play was done, to shift himself,"
2603,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Got touched upon the sleeve familiarly,"
2604,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The moment he had shut the closet door,"
2605,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,By Death himself.  Thus God might touch a Pope
2606,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"At unawares, ask what his baubles mean,"
2607,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And whose part he presumed to play just now.
2608,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Best be yourself, imperial, plain and true!"
2609,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2610,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"So, drawing comfortable breath again,"
2611,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You weigh and find, whatever more or less"
2612,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I boast of my ideal realized                               80
2613,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Is nothing in the balance when opposed
2614,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To your ideal, your grand simple life,"
2615,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Of which you will not realize one jot.
2616,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I am much, you are nothing; you would be all,"
2617,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I would be merely much: you beat me there.
2618,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2619,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"No, friend, you do not beat me: hearken why!"
2620,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The common problem, yours, mine, every one's,"
2621,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Is--not to fancy what were fair in life
2622,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Provided it could be--but, finding first"
2623,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"What may be, then find how to make it fair                 90"
2624,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Up to our means: a very different thing!
2625,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,No abstract intellectual plan of life
2626,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Quite irrespective of life's plainest laws,"
2627,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But one, a man, who is man and nothing more,"
2628,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,May lead within a world which (by your leave)
2629,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Is Rome or London, not Fool's-paradise."
2630,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Embellish Rome, idealize away,"
2631,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Make paradise of London if you can,"
2632,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You're welcome, nay, you're wise."
2633,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2634,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,A  simile!
2635,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We mortals cross the ocean of this world                  100
2636,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Each in his average cabin of a life;
2637,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The best's not big, the worst yields elbow-room."
2638,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Now for our six months' voyage--how prepare?
2639,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You come on shipboard with a landsman's list
2640,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Of things he calls convenient: so they are!
2641,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"An India screen is pretty furniture,"
2642,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"A piano-forte is a fine resource,"
2643,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"All Balzac's novels occupy one shelf,"
2644,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The new edition fifty volumes long;
2645,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And little Greek books, with the funny type               110"
2646,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"They get up well at Leipsic, fill the next:"
2647,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Go on! slabbed marble, what a bath it makes!"
2648,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And Parma's pride, the Jerome, let us add!"
2649,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,'T were pleasant could Correggio's fleeting glow
2650,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Hang full in face of one where'er one roams,"
2651,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Since he more than the others brings with him
2652,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Italy's self--the marvellous Modenese!--
2653,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Yet was not on your list before, perhaps."

2656,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You see him screw his face up; what's his cry
2657,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Ere you set foot on shipboard?  ""Six feet square!"""
2658,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"If you won't understand what six feet mean,"
2659,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Compute and purchase stores accordingly--
2660,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And if, in pique because he overhauls"

2662,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Bare--why, you cut a figure at the first"
2663,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,While sympathetic landsmen see you off;
2664,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Not afterward, when long ere half seas over,"
2665,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You peep up from your utterly naked boards                130
2666,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Into some snug and well-appointed berth,"
2667,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Like mine for instance (try the cooler jug--
2668,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Put back the other, but don't jog the ice!)"
2669,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And mortified you mutter ""Well and good;"
2670,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,He sits enjoying his sea-furniture;

2672,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Though I've the better notion, all agree,"
2673,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Of fitting rooms up.  Hang the carpenter,"

2676,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And meantime you bring nothing: never mind--
2677,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You've proved your artist-nature: what you don't
2678,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You might bring, so despise me, as I say."
2679,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2680,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Now  come, let's backward to the starting-place."
2681,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"See my way: we're two college friends, suppose."
2682,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Prepare together for our voyage, then;"
2683,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Each note and check the other in his work--
2684,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Here's mine, a bishop's outfit; criticise!"
2685,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,What's wrong?  why won't you be a bishop too?
2686,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2687,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Why first, you don't believe, you don't and can't,      150"
2688,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"(Not statedly, that is, and fixedly"
2689,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And absolutely and exclusively)
2690,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,In any revelation called divine.
2691,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,No dogmas nail your faith; and what remains
2692,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But say so, like the honest man you are?"
2693,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"First, therefore, overhaul theology!"
2694,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Nay, I too, not a fool, you please to think,"
2695,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Must find believing every whit as hard:
2696,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And if I do not frankly say as much,"
2697,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The ugly consequence is clear enough.                     160
2698,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2699,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Now wait, my friend: well, I do not believe--"
2700,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"If you'll accept no faith that is not fixed,"
2701,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Absolute and exclusive, as you say."
2702,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You're wrong--I mean  to prove it in due time.
2703,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Meanwhile, I know where difficulties lie"
2704,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I could not, cannot solve, nor ever shall,"
2705,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,So give up hope accordingly to solve--
2706,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"(To you, and over the wine).  Our dogmas then"
2707,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"With both of us, though in unlike degree,"
2708,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Missing full credence--overboard with them!               170
2709,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I mean to meet you on your own premise:
2710,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Good, there go mine in company with yours!"
2711,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2712,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And now what are we? unbelievers both,"
2713,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Calm and complete, determinately fixed"
2714,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To-day, to-morrow and forever, pray?"
2715,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You'll guarantee me that?  Not so, I think!"
2716,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"In no wise! all we've gained is, that belief,"
2717,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"As unbelief before, shakes us by fits,"
2718,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Confounds us like its predecessor.  Where's
2719,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The gain? how can we guard our unbelief,                  180"
2720,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Make it bear fruit to us?--the problem here.
2721,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Just when we are safest, there's a sunset-touch,"
2722,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"A fancy from a flower-bell, some one's death,"
2723,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,A chorus-ending from Euripides--
2724,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And that's enough for fifty hopes and fears
2725,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"As old and new at once as nature's self,"
2726,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To rap and knock and enter in our soul,"
2727,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Take hands and dance there, a fantastic ring,"
2728,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Round the ancient idol, on his base again--"
2729,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The grand Perhaps!  We look on helplessly.                190
2730,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"There the old misgivings, crooked questions are--"
2731,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"This good God--what he could do, if he would,"
2732,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Would, if he could--then must have done long since:"
2733,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"If so, when, where and how? some way must be--"
2734,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Once feel about, and soon or late you hit"
2735,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Some sense, in which it might be, after all."
2736,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Why not, ""The Way, the Truth, the Life?"""
2737,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2738,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,--That way
2739,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Over the mountain, which who stands upon"
2740,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Is apt to doubt if it be meant for a road;
2741,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"While, if he views it from the waste itself,              200"
2742,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Up goes the line there, plain from base to brow,"
2743,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Not vague, mistakable! what's a break or two"
2744,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Seen from the unbroken desert either side?
2745,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And then (to bring in fresh philosophy)
2746,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,What if the breaks themselves should prove at last
2747,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The most consummate of contrivances
2748,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To train a man's eye, teach him what is faith?"
2749,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And so we stumble at truth's very test!
2750,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,All we have gained then by our unbelief
2751,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Is a life of doubt diversified by faith,                  210"
2752,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,For one of faith diversified by doubt:
2753,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We called the chess-board white--we call it black.
2754,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2755,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"""Well,"" you rejoin, ""the end's no worse, at least;"
2756,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We've reason for both colors on the board:
2757,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Why not confess then, where I drop the faith"
2758,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And you the doubt, that I'm as right as you?"""
2759,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2760,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Because, friend, in the next place, this being so,"
2761,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And both things even--faith and unbelief
2762,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Left to a man's choice--we'll proceed a step,"
2763,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Returning to our image, which I like.                     220"
2764,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2765,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"A man's choice, yes--but a cabin-passenger's--"
2766,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The man made for the special life o' the world--
2767,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Do you forget him? I remember though!
2768,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Consult our ship's conditions and you find
2769,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,One and but one choice suitable to all;
2770,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The choice, that you unluckily prefer,"
2771,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Turning things topsy-turvy--they or it
2772,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Going to the ground.  Belief or unbelief
2773,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Bears upon life, determines its whole course,"
2774,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Begins at its beginning.  See the world                   230
2775,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Such as it is--you made it not, nor I;"
2776,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I mean to take it as it is--and you,"
2777,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Not so you'll take it--though you get naught else.
2778,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I know the special kind of life I like,"
2779,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"What suits the most my idiosyncrasy,"
2780,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Brings out the best of me and bears me fruit
2781,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"In power, peace, pleasantness and length of days."
2782,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I find that positive belief does this
2783,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"For me, and unbelief, no whit of this."
2784,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"--For you, it does, however?--that, we'll try!            240"
2785,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"'T is clear, I cannot lead my life, at least,"
2786,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Induce the world to let me peaceably,"
2787,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Without declaring at the outset, ""Friends,"
2788,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I absolutely and peremptorily
2789,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Believe!""--I say, faith is my waking life:"
2790,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"One sleeps, indeed, and dreams at intervals,"
2791,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"We know, but waking's the main point with us,"
2792,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And my provision's for life's waking part.
2793,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Accordingly, I use heart, head and hand"
2794,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"All day, I build, scheme, study, and make friends;        250"
2795,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And when night overtakes me, down I lie,"
2796,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Sleep, dream a little, and get done with it,"
2797,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The sooner the better, to begin afresh."
2798,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,What's midnight's doubt before the dayspring's faith?
2799,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You, the philosopher, that disbelieve,"
2800,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"That recognize the night, give dreams their weight--"
2801,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To be consistent you should keep your bed,"
2802,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Abstain from healthy acts that prove you man,"
2803,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,For fear you drowse perhaps at unawares!
2804,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And certainly at night you'll sleep and dream,            260"
2805,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Live through the day and bustle as you please.
2806,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And so you live to sleep as I to wake,"
2807,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,To unbelieve as I to still believe?
2808,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Well, and the common sense o' the world calls you"
2809,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Bed-ridden--and its good things come to me.
2810,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Its estimation, which is half the fight,"
2811,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,That's the first-cabin comfort I secure:
2812,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The next . . . but you perceive with half an eye!
2813,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Come, come, it's best believing, if we may;"
2814,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You can't but own that!
2815,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Next, concede again,             270"
2816,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"If once we choose belief, on all accounts"
2817,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"We can't be too decisive in our faith,"
2818,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Conclusive and exclusive in its terms,"
2819,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,To suit the world which gives us the good things.
2820,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,In every man's career are certain points
2821,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Whereon he dares not be indifferent;
2822,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The world detects him clearly, if he dare,"
2823,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"As baffled at the game, and losing life."
2824,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,He may care little or he may care much
2825,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"For riches, honor, pleasure, work, repose,                280"
2826,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Since various theories of life and life's
2827,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Success are extant which might easily
2828,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Comport with either estimate of these;
2829,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And whoso chooses wealth or poverty,"
2830,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Labor or quiet, is not judged a fool"
2831,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Because his fellow would choose otherwise;
2832,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We let him choose upon his own account
2833,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,So long as he's consistent with his choice.
2834,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But certain points, left wholly to himself,"
2835,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"When once a man has arbitrated on,                        290"
2836,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We say he must succeed there or go hang.
2837,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Thus, he should wed the woman he loves most"
2838,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Or needs most, whatsoe'er the love or need--"
2839,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"For he can't wed twice.  Then, he must avouch,"
2840,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Or follow, at the least, sufficiently,"
2841,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The form of faith his conscience holds the best,"
2842,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Whate'er the process of conviction was:
2843,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,For nothing can compensate his mistake
2844,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"On such a point, the man himself being judge:"
2845,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"He cannot wed twice, nor twice lose his soul.             300"
2846,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2847,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Well now, there's one great form of Christian faith"
2848,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I happened to be born in--which to teach
2849,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Was given me as I grew up, on all hands,"
2850,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,As best and readiest means of living by;
2851,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The same on examination being proved
2852,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The most pronounced moreover, fixed, precise"
2853,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And absolute form of faith in the whole world--
2854,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Accordingly, most  potent of all forms"
2855,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"For working on the world.  Observe, my  friend!"
2856,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Such as you know me, I am free to say,                    310"
2857,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"In these hard latter days which hamper one,"
2858,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Myself--by no immoderate exercise
2859,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Of intellect and learning, but the tact"
2860,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To let external forces work for me,"
2861,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,--Bid the street's stones be bread and they are bread;
2862,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Bid Peter's creed, or rather, Hildebrand's,"
2863,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Exalt me o'er my fellows in the world
2864,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And make my life an ease and joy and pride;
2865,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"It does so--which for me 's a great point gained,"
2866,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Who have a soul and body that exact                       320
2867,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,A comfortable care in many ways.
2868,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,There's power in me and will to dominate
2869,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Which I must exercise, they hurt me else:"
2870,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"In many ways I need mankind's respect,"
2871,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Obedience, and the love that's born of fear:"
2872,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"While at the same time, there's a taste I have,"
2873,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"A toy of soul, a titillating thing,"
2874,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Refuses to digest these dainties crude.
2875,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The naked life is gross till clothed upon:
2876,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I must take what men offer, with a grace                  330"
2877,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"As though I would not, could I help it, take"
2878,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,An uniform I wear though over-rich--
2879,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Something imposed on me, no choice of mine;"
2880,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,No fancy-dress worn for pure fancy's sake
2881,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And despicable therefore! now folk kneel
2882,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And kiss my hand--of course the Church's hand.
2883,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Thus I am made, thus life is best for me,"
2884,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And thus that it should be I have procured;
2885,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And thus it could not be another way,"
2886,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I venture to imagine.
2887,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2888,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You'll reply,                      340"
2889,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"So far my choice, no doubt, is a success;"
2890,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But were I made of better elements,"
2891,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"With nobler instincts, purer tastes, like you,"
2892,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I hardly would account the thing success
2893,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Though it did all for me I say.
2894,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2895,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But, friend,"
2896,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"We speak of what is; not of what might be,"
2897,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And how 'twere better if 'twere otherwise.
2898,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I am the man you see here plain enough:
2899,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Grant I'm a beast, why, beasts must lead beasts' lives!"
2900,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Suppose I own at once to tail and claws;                  350
2901,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The tailless man exceeds me: but being tailed
2902,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I'll lash out lion fashion, and leave apes"
2903,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,To dock their stump and dress their haunches up.
2904,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"My business is not to remake myself,"
2905,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,But make the absolute best of what God made.
2906,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Or--our first simile--though you prove me doomed
2907,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To a viler berth still, to the steerage-hole,"
2908,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The sheep-pen or the pig-stye, I should strive"
2909,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,To make what use of each were possible;
2910,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And as this cabin gets upholstery,                        360"
2911,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,That hutch should rustle with sufficient straw.
2912,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2913,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But, friend, I don't acknowledge quite so fast"
2914,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I fail of all your manhood's lofty tastes
2915,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Enumerated  so complacently,"
2916,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,On the mere ground that you forsooth can find
2917,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,In this particular life I choose to lead
2918,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,No fit provision for them.  Can you not?
2919,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Say you, my fault is I address myself"
2920,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,To grosser estimators than should judge?
2921,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And that's no way of holding up the soul,                 370"
2922,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Which, nobler, needs men's praise perhaps, yet knows"
2923,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,One wise man's verdict outweighs all the fools'--
2924,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Would like the two, but, forced to choose, takes that."
2925,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I pine among my million imbeciles
2926,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,(You think) aware some dozen men of sense
2927,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Eye me and know me, whether I believe"
2928,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"In the last winking Virgin, as I vow,"
2929,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And am a fool, or disbelieve in her"
2930,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And am a knave--approve in neither case,"
2931,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Withhold their voices though I look their way:            380
2932,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Like Verdi when, at his worst opera's end"
2933,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,(The thing they gave at Florence--what's its name?)
2934,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,While the mad houseful's plaudits near outbang
2935,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"His orchestra of salt-box, tongs and bones,"
2936,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,He looks through all the roaring and the wreaths
2937,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Where sits Rossini patient in his stall.
2938,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2939,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Nay, friend, I meet you with an answer here--"
2940,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,That even your prime men who appraise their kind
2941,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Are men still, catch a wheel within a wheel,"
2942,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"See more in a truth than the truth's simple self,         390"
2943,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Confuse themselves.  You see lads walk the street
2944,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Sixty the minute; what's to note in that?
2945,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You see one lad o'erstride a chimney-stack;
2946,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Him you must watch--he's sure to fall, yet stands!"
2947,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Our interest's on the dangerous edge of things.
2948,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The honest thief, the tender murderer,"
2949,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The superstitious atheist, demirep"
2950,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,That loves and saves her soul in new French books--
2951,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We watch while these in equilibrium keep
2952,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The giddy line midway: one step aside,                    400"
2953,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"They're classed and done with.  I, then, keep the line"
2954,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Before your sages--just the men to shrink
2955,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"From the gross weights, coarse scales and labels broad"
2956,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You offer their refinement.  Fool or knave?
2957,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Why needs a bishop be a fool or knave
2958,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,When there's a thousand diamond weights between?
2959,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"So, I enlist them.  Your picked twelve, you'll find,"
2960,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Profess themselves indignant, scandalized"
2961,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,At thus being held unable to explain
2962,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,How a superior man who disbelieves                        410
2963,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,May not believe as well: that's Schelling's way!
2964,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"It's through my coming in the tail of time,"
2965,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Nicking the minute with a happy tact.
2966,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Had I been born three hundred years ago
2967,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"They'd say, ""What's strange?  Blougram of course believes;"""
2968,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And, seventy years since, ""disbelieves of course."""
2969,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But now, ""He may believe; and yet, and yet"
2970,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"How can he?""  All eyes turn with interest."
2971,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Whereas, step off the line on either side--"
2972,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You, for example, clever to a fault,                      420"
2973,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The rough and ready man who write apace,"
2974,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Read somewhat seldomer, think perhaps even less--"
2975,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You disbelieve!  Who wonders and who cares?
2976,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Lord So-and-so--his coat bedropped with wax,"
2977,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"All Peter's chains about his waist, his back"
2978,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Brave with the needlework of Noodledom--
2979,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Believes!  Again, who wonders and who cares?"
2980,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But I, the man of sense and learning too,"
2981,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The able to think yet act, the this, the that,"
2982,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I, to believe at this late time of day!                   430"
2983,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Enough; you see, I need not fear contempt."
2984,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
2985,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"--Except it's yours! Admire me as these may,"
2986,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You don't.  But whom at least do you admire?
2987,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Present your own perfection, your ideal,"
2988,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Your pattern man for a minute--oh, make haste,"
2989,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Is it Napoleon you would have us grow?
2990,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Concede the means; allow his head and hand,"
2991,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"(A large concession, clever as you are)"
2992,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Good!  In our common primal element
2993,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Of unbelief (we can't believe, you know--                 440"
2994,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"We're still at that admission, recollect!)"
2995,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Where do you find--apart from, towering o'er"
2996,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The secondary temporary aims
2997,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Which satisfy the gross taste you despise--
2998,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Where do you find his star?--his crazy trust
2999,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,God knows through what or in what? it's alive
3000,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And shines and leads him, and that's all we want."
3001,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Have we aught in our sober night shall point
3002,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Such ends as his were, and direct the means"
3003,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Of working out our purpose straight as his,               450"
3004,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Nor bring a moment's trouble on success
3005,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,With after-care to justify the same?
3006,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"--Be a Napoleon, and yet disbelieve--"
3007,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Why, the man's mad, friend, take his light away!"
3008,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"What's the vague good o' the world, for which you dare"
3009,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,With comfort to yourself blow millions up?
3010,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We neither of us see it! we do see
3011,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The blown-up millions--spatter of their brains
3012,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And writhing of their bowels and so forth,"
3013,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,In that bewildering entanglement                          460
3014,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Of horrible eventualities
3015,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Past calculation to the end of time!

3017,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,(Which were my ample warrant for it all)
3018,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"His puff of hazy instinct, idle talk,"
3019,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"""The State, that's I,"" quack-nonsense about crowns,"
3020,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And (when one beats the man to his last hold)

3022,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Policing people efficaciously,"

3024,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The whole to end that dismallest of ends
3025,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"By an Austrian marriage, cant to us the Church,"
3026,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And resurrection of the old regime?
3027,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Would I, who hope to live a dozen years,"
3028,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Fight Austerlitz for reasons such and such?
3029,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"No: for, concede me but the merest chance"
3030,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Doubt may be wrong--there's judgment, life to come"
3031,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"With just that chance, I dare not.  Doubt proves right?"

3038,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Therefore I will not.
3039,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
3040,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Take another case;
3041,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Fit up the cabin yet another way.
3042,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,What say you to the poets? shall we write
3043,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Hamlet, Othello--make the world our own,"
3044,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Without a risk to run of either sort?
3045,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I can't!--to put the strongest reason first.              490
3046,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"""But try,"" you urge, ""the trying shall suffice;"

3052,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"If I'm a Shakespeare, let the well alone;"
3053,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Why should I try to be what now I am?

3055,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,His power and consciousness and self-delight              500

3066,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,But does he say so? look upon his life!
3067,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Himself, who only can, gives judgment there."
3068,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,He leaves his towers and gorgeous palaces
3069,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,To build the trimmest house in Stratford town;

3078,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,From where I stand now (some degree like mine
3079,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Being just the goal he ran his race to reach)
3080,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"He would have run the whole race back, forsooth,"
3081,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And left being Pandulph, to begin write plays?"

3088,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"--Terni's fall, Naples' bay and Gothard's top--"
3089,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Eh, friend?  I could not fancy one of these;"
3090,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But, as I pour this claret, there they are:"
3091,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I've gained them--crossed St. Gothard last July
3092,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,With ten mules to the carriage and a bed
3093,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Slung inside; is my hap the worse for that?
3094,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"We want the same things, Shakespeare and myself,"

3096,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Could fancy he too had them when he liked,"
3097,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But not so thoroughly that, if fate allowed,"
3098,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,He would not have them ...also in my sense.
3099,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We play one game; I send the ball aloft
3100,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,No less adroitly that of fifty strokes
3101,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Scarce five go o'er the wall so wide and high
3102,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Which sends them back to me: I wish and get.
3103,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"He struck balls higher and with better skill,"
3104,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But at a poor fence level with his head,"
3105,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And hit--his Stratford house, a coat of arms,             550"
3106,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Successful dealings in his grain and wool--
3107,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,While I receive heaven's incense in my nose
3108,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And style myself the cousin of Queen Bess.
3109,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Ask him, if this life's all, who wins the game?"
3110,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
3111,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Believe--and our whole argument breaks up.
3112,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Enthusiasm's the best thing, I repeat;"
3113,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Only, we can't command it; fire and life"
3114,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Are all, dead matter's nothing, we agree:"
3115,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And be it a mad dream or God's very breath,"
3116,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The fact's the same--belief's fire, once in us,           560"
3117,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Makes of all else mere stuff to show itself;
3118,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We penetrate our life with such a glow
3119,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"As fire lends wood and iron--this turns steel,"
3120,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"That burns to ash--all's one, fire proves its power"
3121,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"For good or ill, since men call flare success."
3122,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But paint a fire, it will not therefore burn."
3123,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Light one in me, I'll find it food enough!"
3124,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Why, to be Luther--that's   a life to lead,"
3125,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Incomparably better than my own.
3126,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"He comes, reclaims God's earth for God, he says,          570"
3127,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Sets up God's rule again by simple means,"
3128,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Re-opens a shut book, and all is done."
3129,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,He flared out in the flaring of mankind;
3130,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Such Luther's luck was: how shall such be mine?
3131,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"If he succeeded, nothing's left to do:"
3132,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And if he did not altogether--well,"
3133,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Strauss is the next advance.  All Strauss should be
3134,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I might be also.  But to what result?
3135,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,He looks upon no future: Luther did.
3136,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,What can I gain on the denying side?                      580
3137,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Ice makes no conflagration.  State the facts,"
3138,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Read the text right, emancipate the world--"
3139,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,The emancipated world enjoys itself
3140,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,With scarce a thank-you: Blougram told it first
3141,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,It could not owe a farthing--not to him
3142,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"More than Saint Paul! 't would press its pay, you think?"
3143,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Then add there's still that plaguy hundredth chance
3144,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Strauss may be wrong.  And so a risk is run--
3145,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"For what gain? not for Luther's, who secured"
3146,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"A real heaven in his heart throughout his life,           590"
3147,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Supposing death a little altered things.
3148,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
3149,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"""Ay, but since really you lack faith,"" you cry,"
3150,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"""You run the same risk really on all sides,"
3151,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,In cool indifference as bold unbelief.
3152,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,As well be Strauss as swing 'twixt Paul and him.
3153,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"It's not worth having, such imperfect faith,"
3154,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,No more available to do faith's work
3155,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Than unbelief like mine.  Whole faith, or none!"""
3156,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
3157,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Softly, my friend!  I must dispute that point."
3158,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Once own the use of faith, I'll find you faith.           600"
3159,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,We're back on Christian ground.  You call for faith;
3160,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I show you doubt, to prove that faith exists."
3161,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The more of doubt, the stronger faith, I say,"
3162,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,If faith o'ercomes doubt.  How I know it does?
3163,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,By life and man's free will.  God gave for that!
3164,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To mould life as we choose it, shows our choice:"
3165,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"That's our one act, the previous work's his own."
3166,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You criticise the soul? it reared this tree--
3167,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,This broad life and whatever fruit it bears!
3168,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"What matter though I doubt at every pore,                 610"
3169,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Head-doubts, heart-doubts, doubts at my fingers' ends,"
3170,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Doubts in the trivial work of every day,"
3171,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Doubts at the very bases of my soul
3172,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,In the grand moments when she probes herself--
3173,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"If finally I have a life to show,"
3174,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The thing I did, brought out in evidence"
3175,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Against the thing done to me underground
3176,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"By hell and all its brood, for aught I know?"
3177,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I say, whence sprang this? shows it faith or doubt?"
3178,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,All's doubt in me; where's break of faith in this?        620
3179,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"It is the idea, the feeling and the love,"
3180,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,God means mankind  should strive for and show forth
3181,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Whatever be the process to that end--
3182,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And not historic knowledge, logic sound,"

3184,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"""What think ye of Christ,"" friend? when all's done and said,"

3187,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Has it your vote to be so if it can?
3188,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Trust you an instinct silenced long ago                   630
3189,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,That will break silence and enjoin you love
3190,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"What mortified philosophy is hoarse,"

3194,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You form a notion of me, we'll suppose,"

3211,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Some think, Creation's meant to show him forth:"
3212,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I say it's meant to hide him all it can,"
3213,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And that's what all the blessed evil's for.
3214,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Its use in Time is to environ us,"

3223,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Feels God a  moment, ichors o'er the place,"
3224,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Plays on and grows to be a man like us.
3225,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"With me, faith means perpetual unbelief"
3226,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Kept quiet like the snake 'neath Michael's foot

3245,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,He saw the ark a-top of Ararat
3246,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,But did not climb there since 'twas getting dusk
3247,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And robber-bands infest the mountain's foot!

3272,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"As some folk do.  He's tried--no case is proved,"
3273,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Philosophy is lenient--he may go!

3353,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Halfway into the next, which having reached,"
3354,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,It shoots with corresponding foolery
3355,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Halfway into the next still, on and off!"

3374,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"All special-pleading done with--truth is truth,"
3375,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And justifies itself by undreamed ways.
3376,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You don't fear but it's better, if we doubt,"
3377,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To say so, act up to our truth perceived                  810"
3378,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,However feebly.  Do then--act away!
3379,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,'T  is there I'm on the watch for you.  How one acts
3380,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Is, both of us agree, our chief concern:"

3384,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"As I of mine, live up to its full law"
3385,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Since there's no higher law that counterchecks.
3386,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Put natural religion to the test
3387,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You've just demolished the revealed with--quick,          820"
3388,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Down to the root of all that checks your will,"
3389,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"All prohibition to lie, kill and thieve,"
3390,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Or even to be an atheistic priest!
3391,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Suppose a pricking to incontinence--
3392,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Philosophers deduce you chastity
3393,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Or shame, from just the fact that at the first"
3394,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Whoso embraced  a woman in the field,"

3398,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Hence saw the use of going out of sight
3399,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,In wood or cave to prosecute his loves:
3400,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,I read this in a French book t' other day.
3401,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Does law so analyzed coerce you much?
3402,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Oh, men spin clouds of fuzz where matters end,"
3403,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But you who reach where the first thread begins,"
3404,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You'll soon cut that!--which means you can, but won't,"
3405,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Through certain instincts, blind, unreasoned-out,"
3406,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You dare not set aside, you can't tell why,"
3407,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But there they are, and so you let them rule.             840"
3408,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Then, friend, you seem as much a slave as I,"
3409,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"A liar, conscious coward and hypocrite,"
3410,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Without the good the slave expects to get,"
3411,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,In case he has a master after all!
3412,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You own your instincts? why, what else do I,"
3413,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Who want, am  made for, and must have a God"
3414,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Ere I can be aught, do aught?--no mere name"
3415,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Want, but the true thing with what proves its truth,"
3416,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"To wit, a relation from that thing to me,"
3417,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Touching from head to foot--which touch I feel,           850"

3424,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"For simple men: knowledge and power have rights,"
3425,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,But ignorance and weakness have rights too.
3426,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,There needs no crucial effort to find truth
3427,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,If here or there or anywhere about:
3428,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"We ought to turn each side, try hard and see,             860"
3429,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And if we can't, be glad we've earned at least"
3430,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"The right, by one laborious proof the more,"

3435,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And  swear to each detail the most minute
3436,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"In what I think a Pan's face--you, mere cloud:"
3437,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I swear I hear him speak and see him wink,"
3438,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"For fear, if once I drop the emphasis,                    870"
3439,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Mankind  may doubt there's any cloud at all.
3440,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You take the simple life--ready to see,"
3441,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Willing to see (for no cloud 's worth a face)--
3442,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And leaving quiet what no strength can move,"
3443,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And which, who bids you move? who has the right?"
3444,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"I bid you; but you are God's sheep, not mine;"
3445,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"<""Pastor est tui Dominus."">  You find"
3446,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,In this the pleasant pasture of our life

3448,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Much you don't eat because your maw objects,              880"
3449,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Much you would eat but that your fellow-flock
3450,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Open great eyes at you and even butt,"
3451,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And thereupon you like your mates so well
3452,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"You cannot please yourself, offending them;"
3453,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Though when they seem exorbitantly sheep,"
3454,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,You weigh your pleasure with their butts and bleats
3455,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And strike the balance.  Sometimes certain fears
3456,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Restrain you, real checks since you find them so;"
3457,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Sometimes you please yourself and nothing checks:
3458,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"And thus you graze through life with not one lie,         890"
3459,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,And like it best.
3460,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,
3461,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"But do you, in truth's name?"
3462,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"If so, you beat--which means you are not I--"
3463,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,Who needs must make earth mine and feed my fill
3464,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,"Not simply unbutted at, unbickered with,"
3465,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,But motioned to the velvet of the sward
3466,BISHOP BLOUGRAM'S APOLOGY,By those obsequious wethers' very selves.

3590,NOTES,NOTES
3591,NOTES,
3592,NOTES,"""Bishop Blougram's Apology"" is made over the wine after dinner to"
3593,NOTES,"defend himself from the criticisms of a doubting young literary man,"
3594,NOTES,who despises him because he considers that he cannot be true to his
3595,NOTES,convictions in conforming to the doctrines of the Catholic Church.
3596,NOTES,He builds up his defence from the proposition that the problem of
3597,NOTES,"life is not to conceive ideals which cannot be realized, but to find"
3598,NOTES,what is and make it as fair as possible.  The bishop admits his
3599,NOTES,"unbelief, but being free to choose either belief or unbelief, since"
3600,NOTES,"neither can be proved wholly true, chooses belief as his guiding"
3601,NOTES,"principle, because he finds it the best for making his own life and"
3602,NOTES,that of others happy and comfortable in this world.  Once having
3603,NOTES,"chosen faith on this ground, the more absolute the form of faith,"
3604,NOTES,"the more potent the results; besides, the bishop has that desire of"
3605,NOTES,"domination in his nature, which the authorization of the Church"
3606,NOTES,makes safer for him.  To Gigadibs' objection that were his nature
3607,NOTES,"nobler, he would not count this success, he replies he is as God"
3608,NOTES,"made him, and can but make the best of himself as he is.  To the"
3609,NOTES,objection that he addresses himself to grosser estimators than he
3610,NOTES,"ought, he replies that all the world is interested in the fact that"
3611,NOTES,"a man of his sense and learning, too, still believes at this late"
3612,NOTES,hour.  He points out the impossibility of his following an ideal
3613,NOTES,"like Napoleon's, for, conceding the merest chance that doubt may be"
3614,NOTES,"wrong, and judgment to follow this life, he would not dare to"
3615,NOTES,slaughter men as Napoleon had for such slight ends.  As for
3616,NOTES,"Shakespeare's ideal, he can't write plays like his if he wanted to,"
3617,NOTES,but he has realized things in his life which Shakespeare only
3618,NOTES,"imagined, and which he presumes Shakespeare would not have scorned"
3619,NOTES,"to have realized in his life, judging from his fulfilled ambition to"
3620,NOTES,"be a gentleman of property at Stratford.  He admits, however, that"
3621,NOTES,"enthusiasm in belief, such as Luther's, would be far preferable to"
3622,NOTES,"his own way of living, and after this, enthusiasm in unbelief, which"
3623,NOTES,he might have if it were not for that plaguy chance that doubt may
3624,NOTES,be wrong.  Gigadibs interposes that the risk is as great for cool
3625,NOTES,indifference as for bold doubt.  Blougram disputes that point by
3626,NOTES,"declaring that doubts prove faith, and that man's free will"
3627,NOTES,preferring to have faith true to having doubt true tips the balance
3628,NOTES,"in favor of faith, and shows that man's instinct or aspiration is"
3629,NOTES,"toward belief; that unquestioning belief, such as that of the Past,"
3630,NOTES,"has no moral effect on man, but faith which knows itself through"
3631,NOTES,"doubt is a moral spur.  Thus the arguments from expediency,"
3632,NOTES,"instinct, and consciousness, all bear on the side of faith, and"
3633,NOTES,convince the bishop that it is safer to keep his faith intact from
3634,NOTES,"his doubts.  He then proves that Gigadibs, with all his assumption"
3635,NOTES,"of superiority in his frankness of unbelief, is in about the same"
3636,NOTES,"position as himself, since the moral law which he follows has no"
3637,NOTES,"surer foundation than the religious law the bishop follows, both"
3638,NOTES,"founded upon instinct.  The bishop closes as he began, with the"
3639,NOTES,consciousness that rewards for his way of living are of a
3640,NOTES,"substantial nature, while Gigadibs has nothing to show for his"
3641,NOTES,"frankness, and does not hesitate to say that Gigadibs will consider"
3642,NOTES,his conversation with the bishop the greatest honor ever conferred
3643,NOTES,"upon him.  The poet adds some lines, somewhat apologetic for the"
3644,NOTES,"bishop, intimating that his arguments were suited to the calibre of"
3645,NOTES,"his critic, and that with a profounder critic he would have made a"
3646,NOTES,more serious defence.  Speaking of a review of this poem by Cardinal
3647,NOTES,"Wiseman (1801-1865), Browning says in a letter to a friend, printed"
3648,NOTES,"in <Poet-lore>, May, 1896: ""The most curious notice I ever had was"
3649,NOTES,"from Cardinal Wiseman on <Blougram>--<i.e.>, himself.  It was in the"
3650,NOTES,"<Rambler>, a Catholic journal of those days, and certified to be his"
3651,NOTES,"by Father Prout, who said nobody else would have dared put it in."""
3652,NOTES,"This review praises the poem for its ""fertility of illustration and"
3653,NOTES,"felicity of argument,"" and says that ""though utterly mistaken in the"
3654,NOTES,"very groundwork of religion, though starting from the most unworthy"
3655,NOTES,"notions of the work of a Catholic bishop, and defending a"

3965,CLEON,"The fish strikes through the sea, the snake both swims    200"
3966,CLEON,"And slides, forth range the beasts, the birds take flight,"
3967,CLEON,Till life's mechanics can no further go--
3968,CLEON,And all this joy in natural life is put

3998,CLEON,"Watch-tower and treasure-fortress of the soul,"
3999,CLEON,Which whole surrounding flats of natural life
4000,CLEON,Seemed only fit to yield subsistence to;
4001,CLEON,"A tower that crowns a country.  But alas,"
4002,CLEON,The soul now climbs it just to perish there!
4003,CLEON,For thence we  have discovered ('t is no dream--
4004,CLEON,"We know  this, which we had not else perceived)"
4005,CLEON,That there's a world of capability
4006,CLEON,"For joy, spread round about us, meant for us,             240"
4007,CLEON,"Inviting us; and still the soul craves all,"
4008,CLEON,"And still the flesh replies, ""Take no jot more"
4009,CLEON,Than ere thou clombst the tower to look abroad!
4010,CLEON,"Nay, so much less as that fatigue has brought"
4011,CLEON,"Deduction to it.""  We struggle, fain to enlarge"
4012,CLEON,"Our bounded physical recipiency,"
4013,CLEON,"Increase our power, supply fresh oil to life,"
4014,CLEON,"Repair the waste of age and sickness: no,"
4015,CLEON,"It skills not! life's inadequate to joy,"
4016,CLEON,"As the soul sees joy, tempting life to take.              250"
4017,CLEON,They praise a fountain in my garden here
4018,CLEON,Wherein a Naiad sends the water-bow
4019,CLEON,Thin from her tube; she smiles to see it rise.
4020,CLEON,"What if I told her, it is just a thread"
4021,CLEON,"From that great river which the hills shut up,"
4022,CLEON,And mock  her with my  leave to take the same?
4023,CLEON,The artificer has given her one small tube
4024,CLEON,Past power to widen or exchange--what boots

4026,CLEON,She cannot lift beyond her first thin thread;             260
4027,CLEON,And so a man can use but a man's joy
4028,CLEON,"While he sees God's.  Is it for Zeus to boast,"
4029,CLEON,"""See, man, how happy I live, and despair--"
4030,CLEON,"That I may be still happier--for thy use!"""
4031,CLEON,"If this were so, we could not thank our Lord,"
4032,CLEON,As hearts beat on to doing; 'tis not so--
4033,CLEON,Malice it is not.  Is it carelessness?
4034,CLEON,"Still, no.  If care--where is the sign? I ask,"

4044,CLEON,"For, such a poem, such a painting lives."
4045,CLEON,"What? dost thou verily trip upon a word,"
4046,CLEON,Confound the accurate view of what joy is
4047,CLEON,(Caught somewhat  clearer by my eyes than thine)          280

4049,CLEON,And showing how to live (my faculty)
4050,CLEON,With actually living?--Otherwise
4051,CLEON,Where is the artist's vantage o'er the king?
4052,CLEON,Because in my great epos I display
4053,CLEON,"How divers men young, strong, fair, wise, can act--"
4054,CLEON,"Is this as though I acted? if I paint,"
4055,CLEON,"Carve the young Phoebus, am I therefore young?"

4058,CLEON,"Indeed, to know is something, and to prove"
4059,CLEON,"How all this beauty might be enjoyed, is more;"
4060,CLEON,"But, knowing naught, to enjoy is something too."
4061,CLEON,"Yon rower, with the moulded muscles there,"

4519,NOTES,"which was appended to ""Men and Women"" as first published when it"
4520,NOTES,contained fifty poems since distributed under other titles.
4521,NOTES,
4522,NOTES,"The poet, recalling how Rafael when he would all-express his love,"
4523,NOTES,"wrote sonnets to the loved one, and how Dante prepared to paint an"
4524,NOTES,"angel for Beatrice, draws the conclusion that there is no artist but"
4525,NOTES,longs to give expression to his supreme love in some other art than
4526,NOTES,"his own which would be the medium of a spontaneous, natural outburst"
4527,NOTES,of feeling in a way impossible in the familiar forms of his own art.
4528,NOTES,"Thus he would gain a man's joy and miss the artist's sorrow, for,"
4529,NOTES,"like the miracles of Moses, the work of the artist is subject to the"
4530,NOTES,"cold criticism of the world, which expects him nevertheless always"
4531,NOTES,"to be the artist, and has no sympathy for him as a man.  Since there"
4532,NOTES,is no other art but poetry in which it is possible for Browning to
4533,NOTES,"express himself, he will at least drop his accustomed dramatic form"
4534,NOTES,"and speak in his own person; though it be poor, let it stand as a"
4535,NOTES,"symbol for all-expression.  Yet does she not know him, for he has"
4536,NOTES,shown her his soul-side as one might imagine the moon showing
4537,NOTES,"another side to a mortal lover, which would remain forever as much a"
4538,NOTES,"mystery to the outside world as the vision seen by Moses, etc."
4539,NOTES,"Similarly, he has admired the side his moon of poets has shown the"
4540,NOTES,"whole world in her poetry, but he blesses himself with the thought"
4541,NOTES,of the other side which he alone has seen.

4544,NOTES,"sonnets on the back of sketches for his wall painting, the"
4545,NOTES,"""Disputa,"" which are still preserved in collections, one of them in"
4546,NOTES,the British Museum.  The Italian text of these sonnets with English
4547,NOTES,translations are given in Wolzogen's Life of him translated by
4548,NOTES,F. E. Bunn<e`>tt.  Did he ever write a hundred?  It is supposed that
4549,NOTES,"the lost book once owned by Guido Reni, apparently the one referred"

4570,NOTES,"Mr. W. M.  Rossetti makes him obtuse here, as he and other"
4571,NOTES,commentators seem to be in their understanding of Browning
4572,NOTES,throughout this stanza.  Browning evidently contrasts Dante's
4573,NOTES,tenderness here towards Beatrice with the remorselessness of his pen
4574,NOTES,"in the ""Inferno"" (see Cantos 32 and 33), where he stigmatized his"
4575,NOTES,"enemies as if using their very flesh for his parchment, so that ever"
4576,NOTES,after in the eyes of all Florence they seemed to bear the marks of
4577,NOTES,"the poet's hate of their wickedness.  It was people of this sort,"
