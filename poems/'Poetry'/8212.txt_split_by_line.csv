41,SONNET.,With wayworn feet a Pilgrim woe-begone
42,SONNET.,"Life's upward road I journeyed many a day,"
43,SONNET.,And hymning many a sad yet soothing lay
44,SONNET.,Beguil'd my wandering with the charms of song.
45,SONNET.,"Lonely my heart and rugged was my way,"
46,SONNET.,Yet often pluck'd I as I past along
47,SONNET.,"The wild and simple flowers of Poesy,"
48,SONNET.,And as beseem'd the wayward Fancy's child
49,SONNET.,Entwin'd each random weed that pleas'd mine eye.
50,SONNET.,"Accept the wreath, BELOVED! it is wild"
51,SONNET.,And rudely garlanded; yet scorn not thou
52,SONNET.,"The humble offering, where the sad rue weaves"
53,SONNET.,"'Mid gayer flowers its intermingled leaves,"
54,SONNET.,And I have twin'd the myrtle for thy brow.

59,SONNET.,I have collected in this Volume the productions of very distant periods.
60,SONNET.,The lyric pieces were written in earlier youth; I now think the Ode the
61,SONNET.,"most worthless species of composition as well as the most difficult, and"
62,SONNET.,"should never again attempt it, even if my future pursuits were such as"
63,SONNET.,allowed leisure for poetry. The poems addressed to the heart and the
64,SONNET.,understanding are those of my maturer judgment. The Inscriptions will be
65,SONNET.,found to differ from the Greek simplicity of Akenside's in the point
66,SONNET.,"that generally concludes them. The Sonnets were written first, or I"
67,SONNET.,"would have adopted a different title, and avoided the shackle of rhyme"
68,SONNET.,and the confinement to fourteen lines.

183,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
184,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,THE TRIUMPH of WOMAN.
185,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
186,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
187,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Glad as the weary traveller tempest-tost
188,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To reach secure at length his native coast,"
189,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Who wandering long o'er distant lands has sped,"
190,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The night-blast wildly howling round his head,"
191,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Known all the woes of want, and felt the storm"
192,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Of the bleak winter parch his shivering form;
193,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The journey o'er and every peril past
194,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Beholds his little cottage-home at last,"
195,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And as he sees afar the smoke curl slow,"
196,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Feels his full eyes with transport overflow:
197,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"So from the scene where Death and Anguish reign,"
198,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And Vice and Folly drench with blood the plain,"
199,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Joyful I turn, to sing how Woman's praise"
200,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Avail'd again Jerusalem to raise,"
201,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Call'd forth the sanction of the Despot's nod,"
202,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And freed the nation best-belov'd of God.
203,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
204,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Darius gives the feast: to Persia's court,"
205,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Awed by his will, the obedient throng resort,"
206,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Attending Satraps swell the Prince's pride,"
207,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And vanquish'd Monarchs grace their Conqueror's side.
208,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"No more the Warrior wears the garb of war,"
209,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Sharps the strong steel, or mounts the scythed car;"
210,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"No more Judaea's sons dejected go,"
211,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And hang the head and heave the sigh of woe.
212,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,From Persia's rugged hills descend the train.
213,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"From where Orontes foams along the plain,"
214,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"From where Choaspes rolls his royal waves,"
215,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And India sends her sons, submissive slaves."
216,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Thy daughters Babylon to grace the feast
217,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Weave the loose robe, and paint the flowery vest,"
218,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,With roseate wreaths they braid the glossy hair.
219,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"They tinge the cheek which Nature form'd so fair,"
220,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Learn the soft step, the soul-subduing glance,"
221,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Melt in the song, and swim adown the dance."
222,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Exalted on the Monarch's golden throne
223,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,In royal state the fair Apame shone;
224,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
225,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Her form of majesty, her eyes of fire"
226,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Chill with respect, or kindle with desire."
227,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The admiring multitude her charms adore,"
228,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And own her worthy of the crown she wore.
229,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
230,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Now on his couch reclin'd Darius lay,"
231,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Tir'd with the toilsome pleasures of the day;
232,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Without Judaea's watchful sons await
233,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,To guard the sleeping pageant of the state.
234,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Three youths were these of Judah's royal race,"
235,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Three youths whom Nature dower'd with every grace,"
236,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To each the form of symmetry she gave,"
237,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And haughty Genius curs'd each favorite slave;
238,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"These fill'd the cup, around the Monarch kept,"
239,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Serv'd as he spake, and guarded whilst he slept."
240,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
241,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Yet oft for Salem's hallowed towers laid low
242,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The sigh would heave, the unbidden tear would flow;"
243,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And when the dull and wearying round of Power
244,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Allowed Zorobabel one vacant hour,"
245,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He lov'd on Babylon's high wall to roam,"
246,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And stretch the gaze towards his distant home,"
247,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Or on Euphrates' willowy banks reclin'd
248,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Hear the sad harp moan fitful to the wind.
249,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
250,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"As now the perfum'd lamps stream wide their light,"
251,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And social converse chears the livelong night,"
252,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Thus spake Zorobabel, ""too long in vain"
253,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""For Sion desolate her sons complain;"
254,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""In anguish worn the joyless years lag slow,"
255,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""And these proud conquerors mock their captive's woe."
256,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Whilst Cyrus triumph'd here in victor state"
257,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""A brighter prospect chear'd our exil'd fate,"
258,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Our sacred walls again he bade us raise,"
259,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""And to Jehovah rear the pile of praise."
260,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Quickly these fond hopes faded from our eyes,"
261,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""As the frail sun that gilds the wintry skies,"
262,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""And spreads a moment's radiance o'er the plain,"
263,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Soon hid by clouds that dim the scene again."
264,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
265,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Opprest by Artaxerxes' jealous reign"
266,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""We vainly pleaded here, and wept in vain."
267,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Now when Darius, chief of mild command,"
268,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Bids joy and pleasure fill the festive land,"
269,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Still shall we droop the head in sullen grief,"
270,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""And sternly silent shun to seek relief?"
271,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""What if amid the Monarch's mirthful throng"
272,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Our harps should echo to the chearful song?"
273,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
274,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Fair is the occasion,"" thus the one replied,"
275,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""And now let all our tuneful skill be tried."
276,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Whilst the gay courtiers quaff the smiling bowl,"
277,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""And wine's strong fumes inspire the madden'd soul,"
278,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Where all around is merriment, be mine"
279,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""To strike the lute, and praise the power of Wine."
280,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
281,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""And whilst"" his friend replied in state alone"
282,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Lord of the earth Darius fills the throne,"
283,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Be yours the mighty power of Wine to sing,"
284,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""My lute shall sound the praise of Persia's King."""
285,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
286,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To them Zorobabel, on themes like these"
287,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Seek ye the Monarch of Mankind to please;"
288,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""To Wine superior or to Power's strong arms,"
289,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Be mine to sing resistless Woman's charms."
290,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""To him victorious in the rival lays"
291,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Shall just Darius give the meed of praise;"
292,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""The purple robe his honor'd frame shall fold,"
293,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""The beverage sparkle in his cup of gold;"
294,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""A golden couch support his bed of rest,"
295,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""The chain of honor grace his favor'd breast;"
296,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""His the soft turban, his the car's array"
297,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""O'er Babylon's high wall to wheel its way;"
298,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""And for his wisdom seated on the throne,"
299,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""For the KING'S COUSIN shall the Bard be known."""
300,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
301,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Intent they meditate the future lay,"
302,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And watch impatient for the dawn of day.
303,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The morn rose clear, and shrill were heard the flute,"
304,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The cornet, sackbut, dulcimer, and lute;"
305,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To Babylon's gay streets the throng resort,"
306,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Swarm thro' the gates, and fill the festive court."
307,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"High on his throne Darius tower'd in pride,"
308,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The fair Apame grac'd the Sovereign's side;
309,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And now she smil'd, and now with mimic frown"
310,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Placed on her brow the Monarch's sacred crown.
311,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"In transport o'er her faultless form he bends,"
312,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Loves every look, and every act commends."
313,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
314,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And now Darius bids the herald call
315,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Judaea's Bard to grace the thronging hall.
316,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Hush'd is each sound--the attending crowd are mute,"
317,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The Hebrew lightly strikes the chearful lute:
318,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
319,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"When the Traveller on his way,"
320,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Who has toil'd the livelong day,"
321,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Feels around on every side
322,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The chilly mists of eventide,"
323,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Fatigued and faint his wearied mind
324,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Recurs to all he leaves behind;
325,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He thinks upon the well-trimm'd hearth,"
326,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The evening hour of social mirth,"
327,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And her who at departing day
328,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Weeps for her husband far away.
329,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Oh give to him the flowing bowl,"
330,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Bid it renovate his soul;
331,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Then shall sorrow sink to sleep,"
332,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And he who wept, no more shall weep;"
333,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"For his care-clouded brow shall clear,"
334,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And his glad eye shall sparkle thro' the tear.
335,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
336,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When the poor man heart-opprest
337,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Betakes him to his evening rest,"
338,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And worn with labour thinks in sorrow
339,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Of the labor of to-morrow;
340,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When sadly musing on his lot
341,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He hies him to his joyless cot,"
342,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And loathes to meet his children there,"
343,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The rivals for his scanty fare:
344,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Oh give to him the flowing bowl,"
345,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Bid it renovate his soul;
346,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The generous juice with magic power
347,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Shall cheat with happiness the hour,"
348,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And with each warm affection fill
349,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The heart by want and wretchedness made chill.
350,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
351,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"When, at the dim close of day,"
352,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The Captive loves alone to stray
353,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Along the haunts recluse and rude
354,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Of sorrow and of solitude;
355,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When he sits with moveless eye
356,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To mark the lingering radiance die,"
357,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And lets distemper'd Fancy roam
358,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Amid the ruins of his home,--"
359,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Oh give to him the flowing bowl,"
360,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Bid it renovate his soul;
361,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The bowl shall better thoughts bestow,"
362,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And lull to rest his wakeful woe,"
363,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And Joy shall bless the evening hour,"
364,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And make the Captive Fortune's conqueror.
365,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
366,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When the wearying cares of state
367,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Oppress the Monarch with their weight,"
368,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When from his pomp retir'd alone
369,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He feels the duties of the throne,"
370,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Feels that the multitude below
371,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Depend on him for weal or woe;
372,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When his powerful will may bless
373,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"A realm with peace and happiness,"
374,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Or with desolating breath
375,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Breathe ruin round, and woe, and death:"
376,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Oh give to him the flowing bowl,"
377,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Bid it humanize his soul;
378,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He shall not feel the empire's weight,"
379,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He shall not feel the cares of state,"
380,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The bowl shall each dark thought beguile,"
381,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And Nations live and prosper from his smile.
382,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
383,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Husht was the lute, the Hebrew ceas'd the song;"
384,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Long peals of plaudits echoed from the throng;
385,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Each tongue the liberal words of praise repaid,"
386,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,On every cheek a smile applauding play'd;
387,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The rival Bard advanced, he struck the string,"
388,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And pour'd the loftier song to Persia's King.
389,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
390,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Why should the wearying cares of state
391,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Oppress the Monarch with their weight?
392,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Alike to him if Peace shall bless
393,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The multitude with happiness;
394,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Alike to him if frenzied War
395,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Careers triumphant on the embattled plain,"
396,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And rolling on o'er myriads slain,"
397,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,With gore and wounds shall clog his scythed car.
398,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,What tho' the tempest rage! no sound
399,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Of the deep thunder shakes his distant throne,"
400,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And the red flash that spreads destruction round,"
401,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Reflects a glorious splendour on the Crown.
402,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
403,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Where is the Man who with ennobling pride
404,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Beholds not his own nature? where is he
405,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Who but with deep amazement awe allied
406,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Must muse the mysteries of the human mind,"
407,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The miniature of Deity.
408,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,For Man the vernal clouds descending
409,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Shower down their fertilizing rain,"
410,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,For Man the ripen'd harvest bending
411,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Waves with soft murmur o'er the plenteous plain.
412,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He spreads the sail on high,"
413,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The rude gale wafts him o'er the main;
414,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"For him the winds of Heaven subservient blow,"
415,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Earth teems for him, for him the waters flow,"
416,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He thinks, and wills, and acts, a Deity below!"
417,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
418,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Where is the King who with elating pride
419,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Sees not this Man--this godlike Man his Slave?
420,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Mean are the mighty by the Monarch's side,"
421,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Alike the wife, alike the brave"
422,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"With timid step and pale, advance,"
423,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And tremble at the royal glance;
424,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Suspended millions watch his breath
425,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Whose smile is happiness, whose frown is death."
426,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
427,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Why goes the Peasant from that little cot,"
428,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Where PEACE and LOVE have blest his humble life?
429,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,In vain his agonizing wife
430,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"With tears bedews her husband's face,"
431,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And clasps him in a long and last embrace;
432,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"In vain his children round his bosom creep,"
433,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And weep to see their mother weep,"
434,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Fettering their father with their little arms;
435,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,What are to him the wars alarms?
436,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,What are to him the distant foes?
437,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He at the earliest dawn of day
438,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,To daily labor went his way;
439,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And when he saw the sun decline,"
440,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,He sat in peace beneath his vine:--
441,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The king commands, the peasant goes,"
442,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"From all he lov'd on earth he flies,"
443,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And for his monarch toils, and fights, and bleeds, and dies."
444,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
445,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,What tho' yon City's castled wall
446,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Casts o'er the darken'd plain its crested shade?
447,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,What tho' their Priests in earnest terror call
448,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,On all their host of Gods to aid?

450,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,In vain her gallant youths expose
451,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Their breasts, a bulwark, to the foes."
452,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"In vain at that tremendous hour,"
453,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Clasp'd in the savage soldier's reeking arms,"
454,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Shrieks to tame Heaven the violated Maid.
455,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,By the rude hand of Ruin scatter'd round
456,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Their moss-grown towers shall spread the desart ground.
457,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Low shall the mouldering palace lie,"
458,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Amid the princely halls the grass wave high,"
459,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And thro' the shatter'd roof descend the inclement sky.
460,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
461,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Gay o'er the embattled plain
462,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Moves yonder warrior train,"
463,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Their banners wanton on the morning gale!
464,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Full on their bucklers beams the rising ray,"
465,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Their glittering helmets flash a brighter day,"
466,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The shout of war rings echoing o'er the vale:
467,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Far reaches as the aching eye can strain
468,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The splendid horror of their wide array.
469,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Ah! not in vain expectant, o'er"
470,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Their glorious pomp the Vultures soar!
471,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Amid the Conqueror's palace high
472,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Shall sound the song of victory:
473,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Long after journeying o'er the plain
474,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The Traveller shall with startled eye
475,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,See their white bones then blanched by many a winter sky.
476,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
477,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Lord of the Earth! we will not raise
478,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The Temple to thy bounded praise.
479,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"For thee no victim need expire,"
480,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,For thee no altar blaze with hallowed fire!
481,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The burning city flames for thee--
482,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Thine altar is the field of victory!
483,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Thy sacred Majesty to bless
484,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Man a self-offer'd victim freely flies;
485,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To thee he sacrifices Happiness,"
486,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And Peace, and Love's endearing ties,"
487,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To thee a Slave he lives, to thee a Slave he dies."
488,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
489,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
490,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Husht was the lute, the Hebrew ceas'd to sing;"
491,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The shout rush'd forth--for ever live the King!
492,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Loud was the uproar, as when Rome's decree"
493,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Pronounc'd Achaia once again was free;
494,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Assembled Greece enrapt with fond belief
495,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Heard the false boon, and bless'd the villain Chief;"
496,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Each breast with Freedom's holy ardor glows,"
497,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,From every voice the cry of rapture rose;
498,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Their thundering clamors burst the astonish'd sky,"
499,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And birds o'erpassing hear, and drop, and die."
500,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Thus o'er the Persian dome their plaudits ring,"
501,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And the high hall re-echoed--live the King!
502,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The Mutes bow'd reverent down before their Lord,"
503,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The assembled Satraps envied and ador'd,"
504,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Joy sparkled in the Monarch's conscious eyes,"
505,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And his pleas'd pride already doom'd the prize.
506,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
507,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Silent they saw Zorobabel advance:
508,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Quick on Apame shot his timid glance,"
509,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"With downward eye he paus'd a moment mute,"
510,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And with light finger touch'd the softer lute.
511,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Apame knew the Hebrew's grateful cause,"
512,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And bent her head and sweetly smil'd applause.
513,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
514,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Why is the Warrior's cheek so red?
515,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Why downward droops his musing head?
516,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Why that slow step, that faint advance,"
517,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,That keen yet quick-retreating glance?
518,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"That crested head in war tower'd high,"
519,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"No backward glance disgrac'd that eye,"
520,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,No flushing fear that cheek o'erspread
521,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When stern he strode o'er heaps of dead;
522,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Strange tumult now his bosom moves--
523,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The Warrior fears because he loves.
524,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
525,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Why does the Youth delight to rove
526,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Amid the dark and lonely grove?
527,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Why in the throng where all are gay,"
528,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"His wandering eye with meaning fraught,"
529,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Sits he alone in silent thought?
530,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Silent he sits; for far away
531,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,His passion'd soul delights to stray;
532,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Recluse he roves and strives to shun
533,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,All human-kind because he loves but One!
534,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
535,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Yes, King of Persia, thou art blest;"
536,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,But not because the sparkling bowl
537,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,To rapture lifts thy waken'd soul [1]
538,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"But not because of Power possest,"
539,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Not that the Nations dread thy nod,"
540,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And Princes reverence thee their earthly God,"
541,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Even on a Monarch's solitude
542,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Care the black Spectre will intrude,"
543,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The bowl brief pleasure can bestow,"
544,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The Purple cannot shield from Woe.
545,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"But King of Persia thou art blest,"
546,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,For Heaven who rais'd thee thus the world above
547,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Has made thee happy in Apame's love!
548,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
549,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Oh! I have seen his fond looks trace
550,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Each angel feature of her face,"
551,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Rove o'er her form with eager eye,"
552,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And sigh and gaze, and gaze and sigh."
553,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Lo! from his brow with mimic frown,"
554,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Apame takes the sacred crown;
555,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Her faultless form, her lovely face"
556,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Add to the diadem new grace
557,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And subject to a Woman's laws
558,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Darius sees and smiles applause!
559,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
560,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"He ceas'd, and silent still remain'd the throng"
561,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Whilst rapt attention own'd the power of song.
562,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Then loud as when the wintry whirlwinds blow
563,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,From ev'ry voice the thundering plaudits flow;
564,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Darius smil'd, Apame's sparkling eyes"
565,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Glanc'd on the King, and Woman won the prize."
566,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
567,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Now silent sat the expectant crowd, alone"
568,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,The victor Hebrew gaz'd not on the throne;
569,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"With deeper hue his cheek distemper'd glows,"
570,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"With statelier stature, loftier now he rose;"
571,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Heavenward he gaz'd, regardless of the throng,"
572,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And pour'd with awful voice sublimer song.
573,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
574,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Ancient of Days! Eternal Truth! one hymn
575,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"One holier strain the Bard shall raise to thee,"
576,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Thee Powerful! Thee Benevolent! Thee Just!
577,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Friend! Father! All in All! the Vines rich blood,"
578,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The Monarch's might, and Woman's conquering charms,--"
579,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,These shall we praise alone? Oh ye who sit
580,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Beneath your vine, and quaff at evening hour"
581,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The healthful bowl, remember him whose dews,"
582,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Whose rains, whose sun, matur'd the growing fruit,"
583,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Creator and Preserver! Reverence Him,"
584,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,O thou who from thy throne dispensest life
585,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And death, for He has delegated power."
586,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And thou shalt one day at the throne of God
587,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Render most strict account! O ye who gaze
588,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Enrapt on Beauty's fascinating form,"
589,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Gaze on with love, and loving Beauty, learn"
590,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,To shun abhorrent all the mental eye
591,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Beholds deform'd and foul; for so shall Love
592,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Climb to the Source of Virtue. God of Truth!
593,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,All-Just! All-Mighty! I should ill deserve
594,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Thy noblest gift, the gift divine of song,"
595,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"If, so content with ear-deep melodies [2]"
596,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"To please all profitless, I did not pour"
597,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Severer strains; of Truth--eternal Truth,"
598,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Unchanging Justice, universal Love."
599,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Such strains awake the soul to loftiest thoughts,"
600,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Such strains the Blessed Spirits of the Good
601,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Waft, grateful incense, to the Halls of Heaven."
602,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
603,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"The dying notes still murmur'd on the string,"
604,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,When from his throne arose the raptur'd King.
605,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"About to speak he stood, and wav'd his hand,"
606,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And all expectant sat the obedient band.
607,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
608,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Then just and gen'rous, thus the Monarch cries,"
609,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Be thine Zorobabel the well earned prize."
610,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""The purple robe of state thy form shall fold,"
611,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""The beverage sparkle in thy cup of gold;"

618,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Fall'n is Jerusalem!"" the Hebrew cries."
619,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"And patriot anguish fills his streaming eyes,"
620,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Hurl'd to the earth by Rapine's vengeful rod,"
621,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Polluted lies the temple of our God,"
622,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Far in a foreign land her sons remain,"
623,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Hear the keen taunt, and drag the captive chain:"
624,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""In fruitless woe they wear the wearying years,"

628,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""Allow our race to rear that sacred dome,"
629,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"""To live in liberty, and die at Home."""
630,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
631,ROBERT SOUTHEY.,So spake Zorobabel--thus Woman's praise

657,PREFACE.,
658,PREFACE.,"When first the Abolition of the SLAVE-TRADE was agitated in England, the"
659,PREFACE.,friends of humanity endeavoured by two means to accomplish it.--To
660,PREFACE.,destroy the Trade immediately by the interference of Government or by
661,PREFACE.,the disuse of West-Indian productions: a slow but certain method. For a
662,PREFACE.,"while Government held the language of justice, and individuals with"
663,PREFACE.,enthusiasm banished sugar from their tables. This enthusiasm soon
664,PREFACE.,cooled; the majority of those who had made this sacrifice (I prostitute
665,PREFACE.,"the word, but they thought it a sacrifice) persuaded themselves that"
666,PREFACE.,"Parliament would do all, and that individual efforts were no longer"
667,PREFACE.,necessary. Thus ended the one attempt; and the duplicity with which Mr.
668,PREFACE.,"Wilberforce has been amused, and the Slave-Merchants satisfied, has now"
669,PREFACE.,effectually destroyed the other.
670,PREFACE.,
671,PREFACE.,"There are yet two other methods remaining, by which this traffic will"
672,PREFACE.,probably be abolished. By the introduction of East-Indian or Maple
673,PREFACE.,"Sugar, or by the just and general rebellion of the Negroes: by the"
674,PREFACE.,"vindictive justice of the Africans, or by the civilized Christians"
675,PREFACE.,finding it their interest to be humane.
676,PREFACE.,
677,PREFACE.,To these past and present prospects the following Poems occasionally
678,PREFACE.,allude: to the English custom of exciting wars upon the Slave Coast that
679,PREFACE.,"they may purchase prisoners, and to the punishment sometimes inflicted"
680,PREFACE.,"upon a Negro for murder, of which Hector St. John was an eye-witness."

1655,HUMPHREY:,"""Shall Hero Humphrey still be Numps the plough-boy?"

1670,HUMPHREY:,When tir'd and sore amid the piteous throng
1671,HUMPHREY:,"Hungry and cold and wet I limp'd along,"
1672,HUMPHREY:,"And growing fainter as I pass'd and colder,"
1673,HUMPHREY:,Curs'd that ill hour when I became a soldier!
1674,HUMPHREY:,In town I found the hours more gayly pass

3002,XII.,"Yet the ruins were lonely and wild, and their shade"

3005,XII.,
3006,XIII.,XIII.
3007,XIII.,
3008,XIII.,"All around her was silent, save when the rude blast"

3010,XIII.,"Over weed-cover'd fragments still fearless she past,"
3011,XIII.,And arrived in the innermost ruin at last
3012,XIII.,Where the elder tree grew in the aisle.
3013,XIII.,
3014,XIII.,
3015,XIV.,XIV.
3016,XIV.,
3017,XIV.,"Well-pleas'd did she reach it, and quickly drew near"
3018,XIV.,And hastily gather'd the bough:
3019,XIV.,"When the sound of a voice seem'd to rise on her ear,"
3020,XIV.,"She paus'd, and she listen'd, all eager to hear,"
3021,XIV.,Aud her heart panted fearfully now.

3024,XV.,XV.
3025,XV.,
3026,XV.,"The wind blew, the hoarse ivy shook over her head,"

3028,XV.,"The wind ceas'd, her heart sunk in her bosom with dread"
3029,XV.,For she heard in the ruins distinctly the tread
3030,XV.,Of footsteps approaching her near.
3031,XV.,
3032,XV.,
3033,XVI.,XVI.
3034,XVI.,
3035,XVI.,Behind a wide column half breathless with fear
3036,XVI.,She crept to conceal herself there:
3037,XVI.,"That instant the moon o'er a dark cloud shone clear,"
3038,XVI.,And she saw in the moon-light two ruffians appear
3039,XVI.,And between them a corpse did they bear.
3040,XVI.,
3041,XVI.,
3042,XVII.,XVII.
3043,XVII.,

3045,XVII.,"Again the rough wind hurried by,--"
3046,XVII.,"It blew off the hat of the one, and behold"

3093,XXI.,"In Finland there is a Castle which is called the New Rock, moated about"
3094,XXI.,"with a river of unfounded depth, the water black and the fish therein"
3095,XXI.,"very distateful to the palate. In this are spectres often seen, which"
3096,XXI.,"foreshew either the death of the Governor, or some prime officer"
3097,XXI.,belonging to the place; and most commonly it appeareth in the shape of
3098,XXI.,"an harper, sweetly singing and dallying and playing under the water."
3099,XXI.,
3100,XXI.,"It is reported of one Donica, that after she was dead, the Devil walked"
3101,XXI.,"in her body for the space of two years, so that none suspected but that"
3102,XXI.,"she was still alive; for she did both speak and eat, though very"
3103,XXI.,"sparingly; only she had a deep paleness on her countenance, which was"
3104,XXI.,the only sign of death. At length a Magician coming by where she was
3105,XXI.,"then in the company of many other virgins, as soon as he beheld her he"
3106,XXI.,"said, ""fair Maids, why keep you company with the dead Virgin whom you"
3107,XXI.,"suppose to be alive?"" when taking away the magic charm which was tied"
3108,XXI.,"under her arm, the body fell down lifeless and without motion."

3123,DONICA.,"Durst never cast his net,"
3124,DONICA.,Nor ever swallow in its waves
3125,DONICA.,Her passing wings would wet.
3126,DONICA.,
3127,DONICA.,The cattle from its ominous banks
3128,DONICA.,"In wild alarm would run,"
3129,DONICA.,Tho' parched with thirst and faint beneath
3130,DONICA.,The summer's scorching sun.
3131,DONICA.,
3132,DONICA.,For sometimes when no passing breeze
3133,DONICA.,"The long lank sedges waved,"
3134,DONICA.,All white with foam and heaving high
3135,DONICA.,Its deafening billows raved;
3136,DONICA.,
3137,DONICA.,And when the tempest from its base
3138,DONICA.,"The rooted pine would shake,"
3139,DONICA.,The powerless storm unruffling swept
3140,DONICA.,Across the calm dead lake.
3141,DONICA.,
3142,DONICA.,And ever then when Death drew near
3143,DONICA.,"The house of Arlinkow,"
3144,DONICA.,Its dark unfathom'd depths did send
3145,DONICA.,Strange music from below.
3146,DONICA.,
3147,DONICA.,"The Lord of Arlinkow was old,"
3148,DONICA.,"One only child had he,"
3149,DONICA.,Donica was the Maiden's name
3150,DONICA.,As fair as fair might be.
3151,DONICA.,
3152,DONICA.,A bloom as bright as opening morn
3153,DONICA.,"Flush'd o'er her clear white cheek,"
3154,DONICA.,"The music of her voice was mild,"
3155,DONICA.,Her full dark eyes were meek.
3156,DONICA.,
3157,DONICA.,"Far was her beauty known, for none"
3158,DONICA.,"So fair could Finland boast,"
3159,DONICA.,"Her parents loved the Maiden much,"
3160,DONICA.,Young EBERHARD loved her most.
3161,DONICA.,
3162,DONICA.,Together did they hope to tread
3163,DONICA.,"The pleasant path of life,"
3164,DONICA.,For now the day drew near to make
3165,DONICA.,Donica Eberhard's wife.
3166,DONICA.,
3167,DONICA.,"The eve was fair and mild the air,"
3168,DONICA.,Along the lake they stray;
3169,DONICA.,The eastern hill reflected bright
3170,DONICA.,The fading tints of day.
3171,DONICA.,
3172,DONICA.,And brightly o'er the water stream'd
3173,DONICA.,The liquid radiance wide;
3174,DONICA.,Donica's little dog ran on
3175,DONICA.,And gambol'd at her side.
3176,DONICA.,
3177,DONICA.,"Youth, Health, and Love bloom'd on her cheek,"
3178,DONICA.,Her full dark eyes express
3179,DONICA.,In many a glance to Eberhard
3180,DONICA.,Her soul's meek tenderness.
3181,DONICA.,
3182,DONICA.,"Nor sound was heard, nor passing gale"
3183,DONICA.,"Sigh'd thro' the long lank sedge,"
3184,DONICA.,"The air was hushed, no little wave"
3185,DONICA.,Dimpled the water's edge.
3186,DONICA.,
3187,DONICA.,Sudden the unfathom'd lake sent forth
3188,DONICA.,"Strange music from beneath,"
3189,DONICA.,And slowly o'er the waters sail'd
3190,DONICA.,The solemn sounds of Death.
3191,DONICA.,
3192,DONICA.,"As the deep sounds of Death arose,"
3193,DONICA.,"Donica's cheek grew pale,"
3194,DONICA.,And in the arms of Eberhard
3195,DONICA.,The senseless Maiden fell.
3196,DONICA.,
3197,DONICA.,"Loudly the youth in terror shriek'd,"
3198,DONICA.,"And loud he call'd for aid,"
3199,DONICA.,And with a wild and eager look
3200,DONICA.,Gaz'd on the death-pale Maid.
3201,DONICA.,
3202,DONICA.,But soon again did better thoughts
3203,DONICA.,"In Eberhard arise,"
3204,DONICA.,And he with trembling hope beheld
3205,DONICA.,The Maiden raise her eyes.
3206,DONICA.,
3207,DONICA.,And on his arm reclin'd she moved
3208,DONICA.,"With feeble pace and slow,"
3209,DONICA.,And soon with strength recover'd reach'd
3210,DONICA.,
3211,DONICA.,Yet never to Donica's cheek
3212,DONICA.,"Return'd the lively hue,"
3213,DONICA.,"Her cheeks were deathy, white, and wan,"
3214,DONICA.,Her lips a livid blue.
3215,DONICA.,
3216,DONICA.,Her eyes so bright and black of yore
3217,DONICA.,"Were now more black and bright,"
3218,DONICA.,And beam'd strange lustre in her face
3219,DONICA.,So deadly wan and white.
3220,DONICA.,
3221,DONICA.,"The dog that gambol'd by her side,"
3222,DONICA.,"And lov'd with her to stray,"
3223,DONICA.,Now at his alter'd mistress howl'd
3224,DONICA.,And fled in fear away.
3225,DONICA.,
3226,DONICA.,Yet did the faithful Eberhard
3227,DONICA.,Not love the Maid the less;
3228,DONICA.,"He gaz'd with sorrow, but he gaz'd"
3229,DONICA.,With deeper tenderness.
3230,DONICA.,
3231,DONICA.,And when he found her health unharm'd
3232,DONICA.,"He would not brook delay,"
3233,DONICA.,But press'd the not unwilling Maid
3234,DONICA.,To fix the bridal day.
3235,DONICA.,
3236,DONICA.,"And when at length it came, with joy"
3237,DONICA.,"They hail'd the bridal day,"
3238,DONICA.,And onward to the house of God
3239,DONICA.,They went their willing way.
3240,DONICA.,
3241,DONICA.,And as they at the altar stood
3242,DONICA.,"And heard the sacred rite,"
3243,DONICA.,The hallowed tapers dimly stream'd
3244,DONICA.,A pale sulphureous light.
3245,DONICA.,
3246,DONICA.,And as the Youth with holy warmth
3247,DONICA.,"Her hand in his did hold,"
3248,DONICA.,Sudden he felt Donica's hand
3249,DONICA.,Grow deadly damp and cold.
3250,DONICA.,
3251,DONICA.,"And loudly did he shriek, for lo!"
3252,DONICA.,"A Spirit met his view,"
3253,DONICA.,And Eberhard in the angel form
3254,DONICA.,His own Donica knew.
3255,DONICA.,
3256,DONICA.,That instant from her earthly frame
3257,DONICA.,"Howling the Daemon fled,"
3258,DONICA.,And at the side of Eberhard
3259,DONICA.,The livid form fell dead.

3265,DONICA.,
3266,DONICA.,Divers Princes and Noblemen being assembled in a beautiful and fair
3267,DONICA.,"Palace, which was situate upon the river Rhine, they beheld a boat or"
3268,DONICA.,"small barge make toward the shore, drawn by a Swan in a silver chain,"
3269,DONICA.,"the one end fastened about her neck, the other to the vessel; and in it"
3270,DONICA.,"an unknown soldier, a man of a comely personage and graceful presence,"
3271,DONICA.,"who stept upon the shore; which done, the boat guided by the Swan left"
3272,DONICA.,"him, and floated down the river. This man fell afterward in league with"
3273,DONICA.,"a fair gentlewoman, married her, and by her had many children. After"
3274,DONICA.,"some years, the same Swan came with the same barge into the same place;"
3275,DONICA.,"the soldier entering into it, was carried thence the way he came, left"
3276,DONICA.,"wife, children and family, and was never seen amongst them after."
3277,DONICA.,
3278,DONICA.,Now who can judge this to be other than one of those spirits that are
3279,DONICA.,"named Incubi? says Thomas Heywood. I have adopted his story, but not his"
3280,DONICA.,"solution, making the unknown soldier not an evil spirit, but one who had"
3281,DONICA.,"purchased happiness of a malevolent being, by the promised sacrifice of"
3282,DONICA.,his first-born child.

3291,RUDIGER.,
3292,RUDIGER.,And many a one from Waldhurst's walls
3293,RUDIGER.,"Along the river stroll'd,"
3294,RUDIGER.,As ruffling o'er the pleasant stream
3295,RUDIGER.,The evening gales came cold.
3296,RUDIGER.,
3297,RUDIGER.,So as they stray'd a swan they saw
3298,RUDIGER.,"Sail stately up and strong,"
3299,RUDIGER.,And by a silver chain she drew
3300,RUDIGER.,"A little boat along,"
3301,RUDIGER.,
3302,RUDIGER.,Whose streamer to the gentle breeze
3303,RUDIGER.,"Long floating fluttered light,"
3304,RUDIGER.,Beneath whose crimson canopy
3305,RUDIGER.,There lay reclin'd a knight.
3306,RUDIGER.,
3307,RUDIGER.,With arching crest and swelling breast
3308,RUDIGER.,On sail'd the stately swan
3309,RUDIGER.,And lightly up the parting tide
3310,RUDIGER.,The little boat came on.
3311,RUDIGER.,
3312,RUDIGER.,And onward to the shore they drew
3313,RUDIGER.,"And leapt to land the knight,"
3314,RUDIGER.,And down the stream the swan-drawn boat
3315,RUDIGER.,Fell soon beyond the sight.
3316,RUDIGER.,
3317,RUDIGER.,Was never a Maid in Waldhurst's walls
3318,RUDIGER.,"Might match with Margaret,"
3319,RUDIGER.,"Her cheek was fair, her eyes were dark,"
3320,RUDIGER.,Her silken locks like jet.
3321,RUDIGER.,
3322,RUDIGER.,And many a rich and noble youth
3323,RUDIGER.,"Had strove to win the fair,"
3324,RUDIGER.,But never a rich or noble youth
3325,RUDIGER.,Could rival Rudiger.
3326,RUDIGER.,
3327,RUDIGER.,At every tilt and turney he
3328,RUDIGER.,"Still bore away the prize,"
3329,RUDIGER.,For knightly feats superior still
3330,RUDIGER.,And knightly courtesies.
3331,RUDIGER.,
3332,RUDIGER.,"His gallant feats, his looks, his love,"
3333,RUDIGER.,"Soon won the willing fair,"
3334,RUDIGER.,And soon did Margaret become
3335,RUDIGER.,The wife of Rudiger.
3336,RUDIGER.,
3337,RUDIGER.,Like morning dreams of happiness
3338,RUDIGER.,"Fast roll'd the months away,"
3339,RUDIGER.,For he was kind and she was kind
3340,RUDIGER.,And who so blest as they?
3341,RUDIGER.,
3342,RUDIGER.,Yet Rudiger would sometimes sit
3343,RUDIGER.,Absorb'd in silent thought
3344,RUDIGER.,And his dark downward eye would seem
3345,RUDIGER.,With anxious meaning fraught;
3346,RUDIGER.,
3347,RUDIGER.,But soon he rais'd his looks again
3348,RUDIGER.,"And smil'd his cares eway,"
3349,RUDIGER.,And mid the hall of gaiety
3350,RUDIGER.,Was none like him so gay.
3351,RUDIGER.,
3352,RUDIGER.,"And onward roll'd the waining months,"
3353,RUDIGER.,"The hour appointed came,"
3354,RUDIGER.,And Margaret her Rudiger
3355,RUDIGER.,Hail'd with a father's name.
3356,RUDIGER.,
3357,RUDIGER.,But silently did Rudiger
3358,RUDIGER.,"The little infant see,"
3359,RUDIGER.,And darkly on the babe he gaz'd
3360,RUDIGER.,And very sad was he.
3361,RUDIGER.,
3362,RUDIGER.,And when to bless the little babe
3363,RUDIGER.,"The holy Father came,"
3364,RUDIGER.,To cleanse the stains of sin away
3365,RUDIGER.,"In Christ's redeeming name,"
3366,RUDIGER.,
3367,RUDIGER.,Then did the cheek of Rudiger
3368,RUDIGER.,"Assume a death-pale hue,"
3369,RUDIGER.,And on his clammy forehead stood
3370,RUDIGER.,The cold convulsive dew;
3371,RUDIGER.,
3372,RUDIGER.,And faltering in his speech he bade
3373,RUDIGER.,"The Priest the rites delay,"
3374,RUDIGER.,"Till he could, to right health restor'd,"
3375,RUDIGER.,Enjoy the festive day.
3376,RUDIGER.,
3377,RUDIGER.,When o'er the many-tinted sky
3378,RUDIGER.,"He saw the day decline,"
3379,RUDIGER.,He called upon his Margaret
3380,RUDIGER.,To walk beside the Rhine.
3381,RUDIGER.,
3382,RUDIGER.,"""And we will take the little babe,"
3383,RUDIGER.,"""For soft the breeze that blows,"
3384,RUDIGER.,"""And the wild murmurs of the stream"
3385,RUDIGER.,"""Will lull him to repose."""
3386,RUDIGER.,
3387,RUDIGER.,"So forth together did they go,"
3388,RUDIGER.,"The evening breeze was mild,"
3389,RUDIGER.,And Rudiger upon his arm
3390,RUDIGER.,Did pillow the sweet child.
3391,RUDIGER.,
3392,RUDIGER.,And many a one from Waldhurst's walls
3393,RUDIGER.,"Along the banks did roam,"
3394,RUDIGER.,"But soon the evening wind came cold,"
3395,RUDIGER.,And all betook them home.
3396,RUDIGER.,
3397,RUDIGER.,Yet Rudiger in silent mood
3398,RUDIGER.,"Along the banks would roam,"
3399,RUDIGER.,Nor aught could Margaret prevail
3400,RUDIGER.,To turn his footsteps home.
3401,RUDIGER.,
3402,RUDIGER.,"""Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,"
3403,RUDIGER.,"""The rising mists behold,"
3404,RUDIGER.,"""The evening wind is damp and chill,"
3405,RUDIGER.,"""The little babe is cold!"""
3406,RUDIGER.,
3407,RUDIGER.,"""Now hush thee--hush thee Margaret,"
3408,RUDIGER.,"""The mists will do no harm,"
3409,RUDIGER.,"""And from the wind the little babe"
3410,RUDIGER.,"""Lies sheltered on my arm."""
3411,RUDIGER.,
3412,RUDIGER.,"""Oh turn thee--turn thee Rudiger,"
3413,RUDIGER.,"""Why onward wilt thou roam?"
3414,RUDIGER.,"""The moon is up, the night is cold,"
3415,RUDIGER.,"""And we are far from home."""
3416,RUDIGER.,
3417,RUDIGER.,"He answered not, for now he saw"
3418,RUDIGER.,"A Swan come sailing strong,"
3419,RUDIGER.,And by a silver chain she drew
3420,RUDIGER.,A little boat along.
3421,RUDIGER.,
3422,RUDIGER.,"To shore they came, and to the boat"
3423,RUDIGER.,"Fast leapt he with the child,"
3424,RUDIGER.,And in leapt Margaret--breathless now
3425,RUDIGER.,And pale with fear and wild.
3426,RUDIGER.,
3427,RUDIGER.,With arching crest and swelling breast
3428,RUDIGER.,"On sail'd the stately swan,"
3429,RUDIGER.,And lightly down the rapid tide
3430,RUDIGER.,The little boat went on.
3431,RUDIGER.,
3432,RUDIGER.,The full-orb'd moon that beam'd around
3433,RUDIGER.,"Pale splendor thro' the night,"
3434,RUDIGER.,Cast through the crimson canopy
3435,RUDIGER.,A dim-discoloured light.
3436,RUDIGER.,
3437,RUDIGER.,And swiftly down the hurrying stream
3438,RUDIGER.,"In silence still they sail,"
3439,RUDIGER.,And the long streamer fluttering fast
3440,RUDIGER.,Flapp'd to the heavy gale.
3441,RUDIGER.,
3442,RUDIGER.,And he was mute in sullen thought
3443,RUDIGER.,"And she was mute with fear,"
3444,RUDIGER.,Nor sound but of the parting tide
3445,RUDIGER.,Broke on the listening ear.
3446,RUDIGER.,
3447,RUDIGER.,The little babe began to cry
3448,RUDIGER.,"And waked his mother's care,"
3449,RUDIGER.,"""Now give to me the little babe"
3450,RUDIGER.,"""For God's sake, Rudiger!"""
3451,RUDIGER.,
3452,RUDIGER.,"""Now hush thee, hush thee Margaret!"
3453,RUDIGER.,"""Nor my poor heart distress--"
3454,RUDIGER.,"""I do but pay perforce the price"
3455,RUDIGER.,"""Of former happiness."
3456,RUDIGER.,
3457,RUDIGER.,"""And hush thee too my little babe,"
3458,RUDIGER.,"""Thy cries so feeble cease:"
3459,RUDIGER.,"""Lie still, lie still;--a little while"
3460,RUDIGER.,"""And thou shalt be at peace."""
3461,RUDIGER.,
3462,RUDIGER.,"So as he spake to land they drew,"
3463,RUDIGER.,"And swift he stept on shore,"
3464,RUDIGER.,And him behind did Margaret
3465,RUDIGER.,Close follow evermore.
3466,RUDIGER.,
3467,RUDIGER.,"It was a place all desolate,"
3468,RUDIGER.,"Nor house nor tree was there,"
3469,RUDIGER.,And there a rocky mountain rose
3470,RUDIGER.,"Barren, and bleak, and bare."
3471,RUDIGER.,
3472,RUDIGER.,"And at its base a cavern yawn'd,"
3473,RUDIGER.,"No eye its depth might view,"
3474,RUDIGER.,For in the moon-beam shining round
3475,RUDIGER.,That darkness darker grew.
3476,RUDIGER.,
3477,RUDIGER.,"Cold Horror crept thro' Margaret's blood,"
3478,RUDIGER.,"Her heart it paus'd with fear,"
3479,RUDIGER.,When Rudiger approach'd the cave
3480,RUDIGER.,"And cried, ""lo I am here!"""
3481,RUDIGER.,
3482,RUDIGER.,A deep sepulchral sound the cave
3483,RUDIGER.,"Return'd ""lo I am here!"""
3484,RUDIGER.,And black from out the cavern gloom
3485,RUDIGER.,Two giant arms appear.
3486,RUDIGER.,
3487,RUDIGER.,And Rudiger approach'd and held
3488,RUDIGER.,The little infant nigh;
3489,RUDIGER.,"Then Margaret shriek'd, and gather'd then"
3490,RUDIGER.,New powers from agony.
3491,RUDIGER.,
3492,RUDIGER.,And round the baby fast and firm
3493,RUDIGER.,"Her trembling arms she folds,"
3494,RUDIGER.,And with a strong convulsive grasp
3495,RUDIGER.,The little infant holds.
3496,RUDIGER.,
3497,RUDIGER.,"""Now help me, Jesus!"" loud she cries."
3498,RUDIGER.,And loud on God she calls;
3499,RUDIGER.,Then from the grasp of Rudiger
3500,RUDIGER.,The little infant falls.
3501,RUDIGER.,
3502,RUDIGER.,"And now he shriek'd, for now his frame"
3503,RUDIGER.,"The huge black arms clasp'd round,"
3504,RUDIGER.,And dragg'd the wretched Rudiger
3505,RUDIGER.,Adown the dark profound.
3506,RUDIGER.,
3507,RUDIGER.,
3508,RUDIGER.,
3509,RUDIGER.,
3510,RUDIGER.,
3511,RUDIGER.,Hymn
3512,RUDIGER.,
3513,TO THE,TO THE
3514,TO THE,
3515,TO THE,Penates.
3516,TO THE,
3517,TO THE,Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches;
3518,TO THE,feed me with food convenient for me.
3519,TO THE,
3520,TO THE,The words of Agur.
3521,TO THE,
3522,TO THE,
3523,TO THE,
3524,TO THE,The Title of the following Poem will probably remind the Reader of
3525,TO THE,"Akenside's Hymn to the Naiads, but the manner in which I have treated"
3526,TO THE,the subject fortunately precludes comparison.
3527,TO THE,
3528,TO THE,
3529,TO THE,HYMN to the PENATES.
3530,TO THE,
3531,TO THE,Yet one Song more! one high and solemn strain
3532,TO THE,Ere PAEAN! on thy temple's ruined wall
3533,TO THE,"I hang the silent harp: there may its strings,"
3534,TO THE,"When the rude tempest shakes the aged pile,"
3535,TO THE,Make melancholy music. One Song more!
3536,TO THE,PENATES! hear me! for to you I hymn
3537,TO THE,"The votive lay. Whether, as sages deem,"
3538,TO THE,"Ye dwell in the [1]inmost Heaven, the [2]COUNSELLORS"
3539,TO THE,"Of JOVE; or if, SUPREME OF DEITIES,"
3540,TO THE,"All things are yours, and in your holy train"
3541,TO THE,"JOVE proudly ranks, and JUNO, white arm'd Queen."
3542,TO THE,
3543,TO THE,"And wisest of Immortals, aweful Maid"
3544,TO THE,ATHENIAN PALLAS. Venerable Powers!
3545,TO THE,Hearken your hymn of praise! tho' from your rites
3546,TO THE,"Estranged, and exiled from your altars long,"
3547,TO THE,"I have not ceased to love you, HOUSEHOLD GODS!"
3548,TO THE,In many a long and melancholy hour
3549,TO THE,"Of solitude and sorrow, has my heart"
3550,TO THE,With earnest longings prayed to rest at length
3551,TO THE,Beside your hallowed hearth--for PEACE is there!
3552,TO THE,
3553,TO THE,Yes I have loved you long. I call on you
3554,TO THE,"Yourselves to witness with what holy joy,"
3555,TO THE,"Shunning the polished mob of human kind,"
3556,TO THE,I have retired to watch your lonely fires
3557,TO THE,And commune with myself. Delightful hours
3558,TO THE,"That gave mysterious pleasure, made me know"
3559,TO THE,"All the recesses of my wayward heart,"
3560,TO THE,Taught me to cherish with devoutest care
3561,TO THE,"Its strange unworldly feelings, taught me too"
3562,TO THE,The best of lessons--to respect myself!
3563,TO THE,
3564,TO THE,Nor have I ever ceas'd to reverence you
3565,TO THE,DOMESTIC DEITIES! from the first dawn
3566,TO THE,"Of reason, thro' the adventurous paths of youth"
3567,TO THE,"Even to this better day, when on mine ear"
3568,TO THE,"The uproar of contending nations sounds,"
3569,TO THE,But like the passing wind--and wakes no pulse
3570,TO THE,To tumult. When a child--(for still I love
3571,TO THE,"To dwell with fondness on my childish years,"
3572,TO THE,Even as that Persian favorite would retire
3573,TO THE,"From the court's dangerous pageantry and pomp,"
3574,TO THE,"To gaze upon his shepherd garb, and weep,"
3575,TO THE,Rememb'ring humble happiness.) When first
3576,TO THE,"A little one, I left my father's home,"
3577,TO THE,"I can remember the first grief I felt,"
3578,TO THE,And the first painful smile that cloathed my front
3579,TO THE,With feelings not its own: sadly at night
3580,TO THE,I sat me down beside a stranger's hearth;
3581,TO THE,"And when the lingering hour of rest was come,"
3582,TO THE,First wet with tears my pillow. As I grew
3583,TO THE,"In years and knowledge, and the course of Time"
3584,TO THE,"Developed the young feelings of my heart,"
3585,TO THE,When most I loved in solitude to rove
3586,TO THE,Amid the woodland gloom; or where the rocks
3587,TO THE,"Darken'd old Avon's stream, in the ivied cave"
3588,TO THE,"Recluse to sit and brood the future song,"
3589,TO THE,"Yet not the less, PENATES, loved I then"
3590,TO THE,"Your altars, not the less at evening hour"
3591,TO THE,"Delighted by the well-trimm'd fire to sit,"
3592,TO THE,Absorbed in many a dear deceitful dream
3593,TO THE,Of visionary joys: deceitful dreams--
3594,TO THE,"Not wholly vain--for painting purest joys,"
3595,TO THE,They form'd to Fancy's mould her votary's heart.
3596,TO THE,
3597,TO THE,"By Cherwell's sedgey side, and in the meads"
3598,TO THE,Where Isis in her calm clear stream reflects
3599,TO THE,"The willow's bending boughs, at earliest dawn"
3600,TO THE,"In the noon-tide hour, and when the night-mists rose,"
3601,TO THE,I have remembered you: and when the noise
3602,TO THE,Of loud intemperance on my lonely ear
3603,TO THE,"Burst with loud tumult, as recluse I sat,"
3604,TO THE,Pondering on loftiest themes of man redeemed
3605,TO THE,"From servitude, and vice, and wretchedness,"
3606,TO THE,"I blest you, HOUSEHOLD GODS! because I loved"
3607,TO THE,Your peaceful altars and serener rites.
3608,TO THE,"Nor did I cease to reverence you, when driven"
3609,TO THE,"Amid the jarring crowd, an unfit man"
3610,TO THE,"To mingle with the world; still, still my heart"
3611,TO THE,"Sighed for your sanctuary, and inly pined;"
3612,TO THE,"And loathing human converse, I have strayed"
3613,TO THE,"Where o'er the sea-beach chilly howl'd the blast,"
3614,TO THE,"And gaz'd upon the world of waves, and wished"
3615,TO THE,"That I were far beyond the Atlantic deep,"
3616,TO THE,In woodland haunts--a sojourner with PEACE.
3617,TO THE,
3618,TO THE,"Not idly fabled they the Bards inspired,"
3619,TO THE,Who peopled Earth with Deities. They trod
3620,TO THE,The wood with reverence where the DRYADS dwelt;
3621,TO THE,At day's dim dawn or evening's misty hour
3622,TO THE,They saw the OREADS on their mountain haunts.
3623,TO THE,"And felt their holy influence, nor impure"
3624,TO THE,Of thought--or ever with polluted hands
3625,TO THE,Touched they without a prayer the NAIAD'S spring;
3626,TO THE,Yet was their influence transient; such brief awe
3627,TO THE,Inspiring as the thunder's long loud peal
3628,TO THE,"Strikes to the feeble spirit. HOUSEHOLD GODS,"
3629,TO THE,Not such your empire! in your votaries' breasts
3630,TO THE,No momentary impulse ye awake--
3631,TO THE,"Nor fleeting like their local energies,"
3632,TO THE,The deep devotion that your fanes impart.
3633,TO THE,"O ye whom YOUTH has wilder'd on your way,"
3634,TO THE,"Or VICE with fair-mask'd foulness, or the lure"
3635,TO THE,Of FAME that calls ye to her crowded paths
3636,TO THE,"With FOLLY's rattle, to your HOUSEHOLD GODS"
3637,TO THE,"Return! for not in VICE's gay abodes,"
3638,TO THE,Not in the unquiet unsafe halls of FAME
3639,TO THE,Does HAPPINESS abide! O ye who weep
3640,TO THE,"Much for the many miseries of Mankind,"
3641,TO THE,"More for their vices, ye whose honest eyes"
3642,TO THE,"Frown on OPPRESSION,--ye whose honest hearts"
3643,TO THE,Beat high when FREEDOM sounds her dread tocsin;--
3644,TO THE,O ye who quit the path of peaceful life
3645,TO THE,Crusading for mankind--a spaniel race
3646,TO THE,"That lick the hand that beats them, or tear all"
3647,TO THE,Alike in frenzy--to your HOUSEHOLD GODS
3648,TO THE,"Return, for by their altars VIRTUE dwells"
3649,TO THE,And HAPPINESS with her; for by their fires
3650,TO THE,TRANQUILLITY in no unsocial mood
3651,TO THE,"Sits silent, listening to the pattering shower;"
3652,TO THE,"For, so [3]SUSPICION sleep not at the gate"
3653,TO THE,"Of WISDOM,--FALSEHOOD shall not enter there."
3654,TO THE,
3655,TO THE,"As on the height of some huge eminence,"
3656,TO THE,"Reach'd with long labour, the way-faring man"
3657,TO THE,"Pauses awhile, and gazing o'er the plain"
3658,TO THE,"With many a sore step travelled, turns him then"
3659,TO THE,"Serious to contemplate the onward road,"
3660,TO THE,"And calls to mind the comforts of his home,"
3661,TO THE,"And sighs that he has left them, and resolves"
3662,TO THE,To stray no more: I on my way of life
3663,TO THE,"Muse thus PENATES, and with firmest faith"
3664,TO THE,Devote myself to you. I will not quit
3665,TO THE,"To mingle with the mob your calm abodes,"
3666,TO THE,"Where, by the evening hearth CONTENTMENT sits"
3667,TO THE,And hears the cricket chirp; where LOVE delights
3668,TO THE,"To dwell, and on your altars lays his torch"
3669,TO THE,That burns with no extinguishable flame.
3670,TO THE,
3671,TO THE,Hear me ye POWERS benignant! there is one
3672,TO THE,Must be mine inmate--for I may not chuse
3673,TO THE,But love him. He is one whom many wrongs
3674,TO THE,Have sicken'd of the world. There was a time
3675,TO THE,When he would weep to hear of wickedness
3676,TO THE,And wonder at the tale; when for the opprest
3677,TO THE,"He felt a brother's pity, to the oppressor"
3678,TO THE,A good man's honest anger. His quick eye
3679,TO THE,"Betray'd each rising feeling, every thought"
3680,TO THE,Leapt to his tongue. When first among mankind
3681,TO THE,"He mingled, by himself he judged of them,"
3682,TO THE,"And loved and trusted them, to Wisdom deaf,"
3683,TO THE,And took them to his bosom. FALSEHOOD met
3684,TO THE,"Her unsuspecting victim, fair of front,"
3685,TO THE,"And lovely as [4]Apega's sculptured form,"
3686,TO THE,Like that false image caught his warm embrace
3687,TO THE,And gored his open breast. The reptile race
3688,TO THE,"Clung round his bosom, and with viper folds"
3689,TO THE,"Encircling, stung the fool who fostered them."
3690,TO THE,"His mother was SIMPLICITY, his sire"
3691,TO THE,BENEVOLENCE; in earlier days he bore
3692,TO THE,His father's name; the world who injured him
3693,TO THE,Call him MISANTHROPY. I may not chuse
3694,TO THE,"But love him, HOUSEHOLD GODS! for we were nurst"
3695,TO THE,In the same school.
3696,TO THE,
3697,TO THE,PENATES! some there are
3698,TO THE,"Who say, that not in the inmost heaven ye dwell,"
3699,TO THE,Gazing with eye remote on all the ways
3700,TO THE,"Of man, his GUARDIAN GODS; wiselier they deem"
3701,TO THE,A dearer interest to the human race
3702,TO THE,"Links you, yourselves the SPIRITS OF THE DEAD."
3703,TO THE,"No mortal eye may pierce the invisible world,"
3704,TO THE,No light of human reason penetrate
3705,TO THE,That depth where Truth lies hid. Yet to this faith
3706,TO THE,My heart with instant sympathy assents;
3707,TO THE,And I would judge all systems and all faiths
3708,TO THE,"By that best touchstone, from whose test DECEIT"
3709,TO THE,"Shrinks like the Arch-Fiend at Ithuriel's spear,"
3710,TO THE,"And SOPHISTRY'S gay glittering bubble bursts,"
3711,TO THE,"As at the spousals of the Nereid's son,"
3712,TO THE,"When that false [5] Florimel, by her prototype"
3713,TO THE,"Display'd in rivalry, with all her charms"
3714,TO THE,Dissolved away.
3715,TO THE,
3716,TO THE,Nor can the halls of Heaven
3717,TO THE,"Give to the human soul such kindred joy,"
3718,TO THE,"As hovering o'er its earthly haunts it feels,"
3719,TO THE,When with the breeze it wantons round the brow
3720,TO THE,Of one beloved on earth; or when at night
3721,TO THE,"In dreams it comes, and brings with it the DAYS"
3722,TO THE,"And JOYS that are no more, Or when, perchance"
3723,TO THE,With power permitted to alleviate ill
3724,TO THE,"And fit the sufferer for the coming woe,"
3725,TO THE,"Some strange presage the SPIRIT breathes, and fills"
3726,TO THE,"The breast with ominous fear, and disciplines"
3727,TO THE,"For sorrow, pours into the afflicted heart"
3728,TO THE,"The balm of resignation, and inspires"
3729,TO THE,With heavenly hope. Even as a Child delights
3730,TO THE,To visit day by day the favorite plant
3731,TO THE,"His hand has sown, to mark its gradual growth,"
3732,TO THE,And watch all anxious for the promised flower;
3733,TO THE,"Thus to the blessed spirit, in innocence"
3734,TO THE,"And pure affections like a little child,"
3735,TO THE,Sweet will it be to hover o'er the friends
3736,TO THE,"Beloved; then sweetest if, as Duty prompts,"
3737,TO THE,With earthly care we in their breasts have sown
3738,TO THE,"The seeds of Truth and Virtue, holy flowers"
3739,TO THE,Whose odour reacheth Heaven.
3740,TO THE,
3741,TO THE,"When my sick Heart,"
3742,TO THE,"(Sick [6] with hope long delayed, than, which no care"
3743,TO THE,Presses the crush'd heart heavier;) from itself
3744,TO THE,"Seeks the best comfort, often have I deemed"
3745,TO THE,That thou didst witness every inmost thought
3746,TO THE,"SEWARD! my dear dead friend! for not in vain,"
3747,TO THE,Oh early summon'd in thy heavenly course!
3748,TO THE,Was thy brief sojourn here: me didst thou leave
3749,TO THE,With strengthen'd step to follow the right path
3750,TO THE,Till we shall meet again. Meantime I soothe
3751,TO THE,"The deep regret of Nature, with belief,"
3752,TO THE,My EDMUND! that thine eye's celestial ken
3753,TO THE,"Pervades me now, marking no mean joy"
3754,TO THE,The movements of the heart that loved thee well!
3755,TO THE,
3756,TO THE,"Such feelings Nature prompts, and hence your rites"
3757,TO THE,DOMESTIC GODS! arose. When for his son
3758,TO THE,"With ceaseless grief Syrophanes bewail'd,"
3759,TO THE,"Mourning his age left childless, and his wealth"
3760,TO THE,"Heapt for an alien, he with fixed eye"
3761,TO THE,Still on the imaged marble of the dead
3762,TO THE,"Dwelt, pampering sorrow. Thither from his wrath"
3763,TO THE,"A safe asylum, fled the offending slave,"
3764,TO THE,And garlanded the statue and implored
3765,TO THE,His young lost Lord to save: Remembrance then
3766,TO THE,"Softened the father, and he loved to see"
3767,TO THE,"The votive wreath renewed, and the rich smoke"
3768,TO THE,Curl from the costly censer slow and sweet.
3769,TO THE,From Egypt soon the sorrow-soothing rites
3770,TO THE,Divulging spread; before your [7] idol forms
3771,TO THE,"By every hearth the blinded Pagan knelt,"
3772,TO THE,"Pouring his prayers to these, and offering there"
3773,TO THE,"Vain sacrifice or impious, and sometimes"
3774,TO THE,With human blood your sanctuary defil'd:
3775,TO THE,"Till the first BRUTUS, tyrant-conquering chief,"
3776,TO THE,"Arose; he first the impious rites put down,"
3777,TO THE,"He fitliest, who for FREEDOM lived and died,"
3778,TO THE,The friend of humankind. Then did your feasts
3779,TO THE,Frequent recur and blameless; and when came
3780,TO THE,"The solemn [8] festival, whose happiest rites"
3781,TO THE,"Emblem'd EQUALITY, the holiest truth!"
3782,TO THE,"Crown'd with gay garlands were your statues seen,"
3783,TO THE,"To you the fragrant censer smok'd, to you"
3784,TO THE,The rich libation flow'd: vain sacrifice!
3785,TO THE,For nor the poppy wreath nor fruits nor wine.
3786,TO THE,"Ye ask, PENATES! nor the altar cleans'd"
3787,TO THE,With many a mystic form; ye ask the heart
3788,TO THE,"Made pure, and by domestic Peace and Love"
3789,TO THE,Hallowed to you.
3790,TO THE,
3791,TO THE,"Hearken your hymn of praise,"
3792,TO THE,"PENATES! to your shrines I come for rest,"
3793,TO THE,"There only to be found. Often at eve,"
3794,TO THE,Amid my wanderings I have seen far off
3795,TO THE,"The lonely light that spake of comfort there,"
3796,TO THE,"It told my heart of many a joy of home,"
3797,TO THE,And my poor heart was sad. When I have gazed
3798,TO THE,From some high eminence on goodly vales
3799,TO THE,"And cots and villages embower'd below,"
3800,TO THE,The thought would rise that all to me was strange
3801,TO THE,"Amid the scene so fair, nor one small spot"
3802,TO THE,"Where my tir'd mind might rest and call it home,"
3803,TO THE,There is a magic in that little word;
3804,TO THE,It is a mystic circle that surrounds
3805,TO THE,Comforts and Virtues never known beyond
3806,TO THE,The hallowed limit. Often has my heart
3807,TO THE,"Ached for that quiet haven; haven'd now,"
3808,TO THE,I think of those in this world's wilderness
3809,TO THE,Who wander on and find no home of rest
3810,TO THE,Till to the grave they go! them POVERTY
3811,TO THE,"Hollow-eyed fiend, the child of WEALTH and POWER,"
3812,TO THE,"Bad offspring of worse parents, aye afflicts,"
3813,TO THE,Cankering with her foul mildews the chill'd heart--
3814,TO THE,Them WANT with scorpion scourge drives to the den
3815,TO THE,Of GUILT--them SLAUGHTER with the price of death
3816,TO THE,Buys for her raven brood. Oh not on them
3817,TO THE,GOD OF ETERNAL JUSTICE! not on them
3818,TO THE,Let fall thy thunder!
3819,TO THE,
3820,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!
3821,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,Then only shall be Happiness on earth
3822,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"When Man shall feel your sacred power, and love"
3823,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,Your tranquil joys; then shall the city stand
3824,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"A huge void sepulchre, and rising fair"
3825,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,Amid the ruins of the palace pile
3826,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"The Olive grow, there shall the TREE OF PEACE"
3827,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,Strike its roots deep and flourish. This the state
3828,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"Shall bless the race redeemed of Man, when WEALTH"
3829,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,And POWER and all their hideous progeny
3830,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"Shall sink annihilate, and all mankind"
3831,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,Live in the equal brotherhood of LOVE.
3832,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,Heart-calming hope and sure! for hitherward
3833,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"Tend all the tumults of the troubled world,"
3834,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"Its woes, its wisdom, and its wickedness"
3835,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,Alike: so he hath will'd whose will is just.
3836,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,
3837,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"Meantime, all hoping and expecting all"
3838,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"In patient faith, to you, DOMESTIC GODS!"
3839,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,"I come, studious of other lore than song,"
3840,HOUSEHOLD DEITIES!,Of my past years the solace and support:
