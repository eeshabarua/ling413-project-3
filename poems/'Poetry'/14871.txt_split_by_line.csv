39,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"The Poems contained in this booklet composed when ill, and either blind or"
40,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"nearly so, are given to the public for the purpose of strengthening faith"
41,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"in God. Those outlining in part, a life that has been more than filled by"
42,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"the disciplinarian, sorrow, are but a glimpse of the many heavy crosses"
43,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,borne. In my retrospection I can only believe the Father deemed me worthy
44,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"to be tested, at the same time giving wonderful revelations of Himself and"
45,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"many answers to prayer. Thanks be to Him, that I was brought through the"
46,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"fire with unshaken faith in Christ, for this end, to prove that those who"
47,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"stand firm in faith will not only be given a victory, but be brought to a"
48,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"greater joy and fellowship with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."
49,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,
50,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"Life's battles well waged, victoriously fought,"
51,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,Rich jewels of pearls in Cross will be wrought;
52,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,"E'er trusting in One who knoweth no wrong,"
53,TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER,Forever we'll live in Land of the Strong.
