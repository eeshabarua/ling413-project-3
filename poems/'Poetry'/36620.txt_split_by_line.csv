81,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,
82,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,
83,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,As I stand waiting in the rain
84,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"For the foggy hoot of the London train,"
85,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Gazing at silent wall and lamp
86,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"And post and rail and platform damp,"
87,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,What is this power that comes to my sight
88,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"That I see a night without the night,"
89,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"That I see them clear, yet look them through,"
90,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"The silvery things and the darkly blue,"
91,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"That the solid wall seems soft as death,"
92,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"A wavering and unanchored wraith,"
93,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,And rails that shine and stones that stream
94,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Unsubstantial as a dream?
95,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"What sudden door has opened so,"
96,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"What hand has passed, that I should know"
97,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,This moving vision not of trance
98,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"That melts the globe of circumstance,"
99,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,This sight that marks not least or most
100,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,And makes a stone a passing ghost?
101,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,
102,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Is it that a year ago
103,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,I stood upon this self-same spot;
104,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Is it that since a year ago
105,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,The place and I have altered not;
106,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Is it that I half forgot,"
107,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"A year ago, and all despised"
108,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,For a space the things that I had prized:
109,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"The race of life, the glittering show?"
110,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Is it that now a year has passed
111,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Of vain pursuit of glittering things,"
112,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Of fruitless searching, shouting, running,"
113,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"And greedy lies and candour cunning,"
114,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Here as I stand the year above
115,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Sudden the heats and the strivings fail
116,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"And fall away, a fluctuant veil,"
117,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,And the fixed familiar stones restore
118,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"The old appearance-buried core,"
119,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"The moveless and essential me,"
120,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,The eternal personality
121,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Alone enduring first and last?
122,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,
123,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"No, this I have known in other ways,"
124,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"In other places, other days."
125,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Not only here, on this one peak,"
126,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Do fixity and beauty speak
127,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Of the delusiveness of change,"
128,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Of the transparency of form,"
129,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"The bootless stress of minds that range,"
130,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,The awful calm behind the storm.
131,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"In many places, many days,"
132,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,The invaded soul receives the rays
133,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Of countries she was nurtured in,"
134,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Speaks in her silent language strange
135,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,To that beyond which is her kin.
136,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Even in peopled streets at times
137,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,A metaphysic arm is thrust
138,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Through the partitioning fabric thin,"
139,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,And tears away the darkening pall
140,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Cast by the bright phenomenal,"
141,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,And clears the obscured spirit's mirror
142,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"From shadows of deceptive error,"
143,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"And shows the bells and all their ringing,"
144,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"And all the crowds and all their singing,"
145,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Carillons that are nothing's chimes
146,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,And dust that is not even dust....
147,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,But rarely hold I converse thus
148,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Where shapes are bright and clamorous,"
149,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,More often comes the word divine
150,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,In places motionless and far;
151,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Beneath the white peculiar shine
152,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Of sunless summer afternoons;
153,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,At eventide on pale lagoons
154,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Where hangs reflected one pale star;
155,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Or deep in the green solitudes
156,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Of still erect entrancèd woods.
157,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,
158,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"O, in the woods alone lying,"
159,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Scarce a bough in the wind sighing,"
160,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Gaze I long with fervid power
161,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"At leaf and branch and grass and flower,"
162,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Breathe I breaths of trembling sight
163,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Shed from great urns of green delight,"
164,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Take I draughts and drink them up
165,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Poured from many a stalk and cup.
166,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Now do I burn for nothing more
167,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Than thus to gaze, thus to adore"
168,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,This exquisiteness of nature ever
169,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,In silence....
170,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,
171,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,But with instant light
172,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Rends the film; with joy I quiver
173,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,To see with new celestial sight
174,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Flower and leaf and grass and tree,"
175,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Doomed barks on an eternal sea,"
176,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Flit phantom-like as transient smoke.
177,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Beauty herself her spell has broke,"
178,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Beauty, the herald and the lure,"
179,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Her message told, may not endure;"
180,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Her portal opened, she has died,"
181,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Supreme immortal suicide.
182,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Yes, sleepless nature soundless flings"
183,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Invisible grapples round the soul,"
184,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Drawing her through the web of things
185,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"To the primal end of her journeyings,"
186,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,Her ultimate and constant pole.
187,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,
188,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,For Beauty with her hands that beckon
189,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Is but the Prophet of a Higher,"
190,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"A flaming and ephemeral beacon,"
191,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,A Phoenix perishing by fire.
192,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Herself from us herself estranges,"
193,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Herself her mighty tale doth kill,"
194,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"That all things change yet nothing changes,"
195,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,That all things move yet all are still.
196,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,
197,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"I cannot sink, I cannot climb,"
198,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Now that I see my ancient dwelling,"
199,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"The central orb untouched of time,"
200,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,And taste a peace all bliss excelling.
201,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Now I have broken Beauty's wall,"
202,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,"Now that my kindred world I hold,"
203,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,I care not though the cities fall
204,ANTINOMIES ON A RAILWAY STATION,And the green earth go cold.

210,THE THREE HILLS,
211,THE THREE HILLS,
212,THE THREE HILLS,There were three hills that stood alone
213,THE THREE HILLS,With woods about their feet.
214,THE THREE HILLS,They dreamed quiet when the sun shone
215,THE THREE HILLS,And whispered when the rain beat.
216,THE THREE HILLS,
217,THE THREE HILLS,They wore all three their coronals
218,THE THREE HILLS,Till men with houses came
219,THE THREE HILLS,And scored their heads with pits and walls
220,THE THREE HILLS,And thought the hills were tame.
221,THE THREE HILLS,
222,THE THREE HILLS,Red and white when day shines bright
223,THE THREE HILLS,"They hide the green for miles,"
224,THE THREE HILLS,Where are the old hills gone? At night
225,THE THREE HILLS,The moon looks down and smiles.
226,THE THREE HILLS,
227,THE THREE HILLS,"She sees the captors small and weak,"
228,THE THREE HILLS,"She knows the prisoners strong,"
229,THE THREE HILLS,She hears the patient hills that speak:
230,THE THREE HILLS,"""Brothers, it is not long;"
231,THE THREE HILLS,
232,THE THREE HILLS,"""Brothers, we stood when they were not"
233,THE THREE HILLS,Ten thousand summers past.
234,THE THREE HILLS,"Brothers, when they are clean forgot"
235,THE THREE HILLS,We shall outlive the last;
236,THE THREE HILLS,
237,THE THREE HILLS,"""One shall die and one shall flee"
238,THE THREE HILLS,"With terror in his train,"
239,THE THREE HILLS,"And earth shall eat the stones, and we"
240,THE THREE HILLS,"Shall be alone again."""

248,A CHANT,Gently the petals fall as the tree gently sways
249,A CHANT,That has known many springs and many petals fall
250,A CHANT,Year after year to strew the green deserted ways
251,A CHANT,"And the statue and the pond and the low, broken wall."
252,A CHANT,
253,A CHANT,"Faded is the memory of old things done,"
254,A CHANT,Peace floats on the ruins of ancient festival;
255,A CHANT,"They lie and forget in the warmth of the sun,"
256,A CHANT,And a sky silver-blue arches over all.
257,A CHANT,
258,A CHANT,"O softly, O tenderly, the heart now stirs"
259,A CHANT,"With desires faint and formless; and, seeking not, I find"
260,A CHANT,Quiet thoughts that flash like azure king-fishers
261,A CHANT,Across the luminous tranquil mirror of the mind.

268,ARTEMIS ALTERA,
269,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"O full of candour and compassion,"
270,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"Whom love and worship both would praise,"
271,ARTEMIS ALTERA,Love cannot frame nor worship fashion
272,ARTEMIS ALTERA,The image of your fearless ways!
273,ARTEMIS ALTERA,
274,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"How show your noble brow's dark pallor,"
275,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"Your chivalrous casque of ebon hair,"
276,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"Your eyes' bright strength, your lips' soft valour,"
277,ARTEMIS ALTERA,Your supple shoulders and hands that dare?
278,ARTEMIS ALTERA,
279,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"Our souls when naïvely you examine,"
280,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"Your sword of innocence, flaming, huge,"
281,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"Sweeps over us, and there is famine"
282,ARTEMIS ALTERA,Within the ports of subterfuge.
283,ARTEMIS ALTERA,
284,ARTEMIS ALTERA,You hate contempt and love not laughter;
285,ARTEMIS ALTERA,With your sharp spear of virgin will
286,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"You harry the wicked strong; but after,"
287,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"O huntress who could never kill,"
288,ARTEMIS ALTERA,
289,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"Should they be trodden down or pierced,"
290,ARTEMIS ALTERA,"Swift, swift, you fly with burning cheek"
291,ARTEMIS ALTERA,To place your beauty's shield reversed
292,ARTEMIS ALTERA,Above the vile defenceless weak!

299,STARLIGHT,
300,STARLIGHT,Last night I lay in an open field
301,STARLIGHT,And looked at the stars with lips sealed;
302,STARLIGHT,"No noise moved the windless air,"
303,STARLIGHT,And I looked at the stars with steady stare.
304,STARLIGHT,
305,STARLIGHT,There were some that glittered and some that shone
306,STARLIGHT,"With a soft and equal glow, and one"
307,STARLIGHT,"That queened it over the sprinkled round,"
308,STARLIGHT,Swaying the host with silent sound.
309,STARLIGHT,
310,STARLIGHT,"""Calm things,"" I thought, ""in your cavern blue,"
311,STARLIGHT,I will learn and hold and master you;
312,STARLIGHT,"I will yoke and scorn you as I can,"
313,STARLIGHT,"For the pride of my heart is the pride of a man."""
314,STARLIGHT,
315,STARLIGHT,Grass to my cheek in the dewy field
316,STARLIGHT,"I lay quite still with lips sealed,"
317,STARLIGHT,And the pride of a man and his rigid gaze
318,STARLIGHT,Stalked like swords on heaven's ways.
319,STARLIGHT,
320,STARLIGHT,But through a sudden gate there stole
321,STARLIGHT,The Universe and spread in my soul;
322,STARLIGHT,"Quick went my breath and quick my heart,"
323,STARLIGHT,And I looked at the stars with lips apart.

330,FLORIAN'S SONG,
331,FLORIAN'S SONG,"My soul, it shall not take us,"
332,FLORIAN'S SONG,O we will escape
333,FLORIAN'S SONG,This world that strives to break us
334,FLORIAN'S SONG,And cast us to its shape;
335,FLORIAN'S SONG,"Its chisel shall not enter,"
336,FLORIAN'S SONG,"Its fire shall not touch,"
337,FLORIAN'S SONG,"Hard from rim to centre,"
338,FLORIAN'S SONG,We will not crack or smutch.
339,FLORIAN'S SONG,
340,FLORIAN'S SONG,'Gainst words sweet and flowered
341,FLORIAN'S SONG,"We have an amulet,"
342,FLORIAN'S SONG,We will not play the coward
343,FLORIAN'S SONG,For any black threat;
344,FLORIAN'S SONG,If we but give endurance
345,FLORIAN'S SONG,To what is now within--
346,FLORIAN'S SONG,The single assurance
347,FLORIAN'S SONG,That it is good to win.
348,FLORIAN'S SONG,
349,FLORIAN'S SONG,Slaves think it better
350,FLORIAN'S SONG,"To be weak than strong,"
351,FLORIAN'S SONG,Whose hate is a fetter
352,FLORIAN'S SONG,And their love a thong.
353,FLORIAN'S SONG,But we will view those others
354,FLORIAN'S SONG,"With eyes like stone,"
355,FLORIAN'S SONG,And if we have no brothers
356,FLORIAN'S SONG,We will walk alone.

369,THE ONE,"moans like moaning of the sea,"
370,THE ONE,And sour's the taste now culled in haste of
371,THE ONE,"lovely things I won too late,"
372,THE ONE,And loud and loud above the crowd the

380,THE OTHER,Were you so insolent to think its rope would
381,THE OTHER,never circle you?
382,THE OTHER,Did you then beastlike live and walk with
383,THE OTHER,ears and eyes that would not turn?
384,THE OTHER,Who bade you hope your service 'scape in

390,THE ONE,No; for I swear now bare's the tree and loud
391,THE ONE,"the moaning of the wind,"
392,THE ONE,"I walked no rut with eyelids shut, my ears"
393,THE ONE,"and eyes were never blind,"
394,THE ONE,Only my eager thoughts I bent on many
395,THE ONE,things that I desired
396,THE ONE,To make my greedy heart content ere flesh
397,THE ONE,and blood I left behind.

401,THE OTHER,
402,THE OTHER,"Ignorance, then, was all your fault and"
403,THE OTHER,"filmèd eyes that could not know,"
404,THE OTHER,That half discerned and never learned the
405,THE OTHER,temporal way that men must go;
406,THE OTHER,You set the image of the world high for
407,THE OTHER,"your heart's idolatry,"
408,THE OTHER,Though with your lips you called the world
409,THE OTHER,"a toy, a ghost, a passing show."
410,THE OTHER,

412,THE ONE,THE ONE
413,THE ONE,
414,THE ONE,"No, no; this is not true; my lips spoke"
415,THE ONE,only what my heart believed.
416,THE ONE,Called I the world a toy; I spoke not echo-like
417,THE ONE,or self-deceived.
418,THE ONE,But that I thought the toy was mine to play
419,THE ONE,"with, and the passing show"
420,THE ONE,"Would sate at least my passing lusts, and did"
421,THE ONE,"not, therefore am I grieved."
422,THE ONE,
423,THE ONE,What did I do that I must bear this lifelong
424,THE ONE,"tyranny of my fate,"
425,THE ONE,That I must writhe in bonds unsought of
426,THE ONE,accidental love and hate?
427,THE ONE,"Had chance but joinèd different dice, but"
428,THE ONE,"once or twice, but once or twice,"
429,THE ONE,All lovely things that I desired I should have
430,THE ONE,held before too late.
431,THE ONE,
432,THE ONE,Surely I knew that flesh was grass nor valued
433,THE ONE,"overmuch the prize,"
434,THE ONE,But all the powers of chance conspired to
435,THE ONE,cheat a man both just and wise.
436,THE ONE,Happy I'd been had I but had my due
437,THE ONE,"reward, and not a sword"
438,THE ONE,Flaming in diabolic hand between me and
439,THE ONE,my Paradise.

442,THE OTHER,
443,THE OTHER,No hooded band of fates did stand your

446,THE OTHER,"thrust across your way,"
447,THE OTHER,"Only the things all men must meet, the"

582,II,"Till some bright afternoon, athwart"

848,(F.T.),(F.T.)
849,(F.T.),
850,(F.T.),
851,(F.T.),"The cord broke, and the tent"
852,(F.T.),"Slipped, and the silken roof"
853,(F.T.),Lay prone beneath the viewless hoof
854,(F.T.),Of the deliberate firmament.
855,(F.T.),Yet cared we not; how should we care?
856,(F.T.),Knowing that labourless now he breathes
857,(F.T.),A golden paradisal air
858,(F.T.),Where with more certain craft he wreathes
859,(F.T.),Bright braids of words more wise and fair
860,(F.T.),"Than ever his earthly fabrics were,"
861,(F.T.),"That his unwavering eyes made fresh,"
862,(F.T.),"Purged and regarbed in fadeless flesh,"
863,(F.T.),"What he then darkly guessed behold,"
864,(F.T.),And watch with an abiding joy
865,(F.T.),The eternal mysteries unfold
866,(F.T.),Which do his now transfigured songs evermore employ.
867,(F.T.),
868,(F.T.),"Brother, yet great thy power;"
869,(F.T.),Thou stood'st as on a tower
870,(F.T.),Small 'neath the stars yet high above the fields;
871,(F.T.),In thy alembic song
872,(F.T.),Imagination strong
873,(F.T.),Distilled what essences the quest to mortals yields.
874,(F.T.),"This thy reward well-won,"
875,(F.T.),For every morning's sun
876,(F.T.),Found thy heart's firm allegiance still unshaken;
877,(F.T.),No temporal ache or smart
878,(F.T.),"Drave Beauty from thy heart,"
879,(F.T.),And by thy mighty mistress never wast forsaken.
880,(F.T.),
881,(F.T.),"Yes; for though stringent was the test,"
882,(F.T.),"When that thy trial was bitterest,"
883,(F.T.),Steadfast thou did'st remain; unshod
884,(F.T.),"The harrows of Pain thy feet once trod,"
885,(F.T.),Humiliate as thy sad song tells
886,(F.T.),Before the vault's white sentinels.
887,(F.T.),"Friendless and faint thou sojourned'st there,"
888,(F.T.),"A bowed, brave, timid wanderer,"
889,(F.T.),"A lonely nomad of the spirit,"
890,(F.T.),"Who did a triple curse inherit,"
891,(F.T.),"Hunger, regret and memory."
892,(F.T.),Yet never did they vanquish thee;
893,(F.T.),"When nighest broken, most alone,"
894,(F.T.),Thy unassuagèd thoughts could clamber
895,(F.T.),To beauty on her ageless throne;
896,(F.T.),Thou wert as one in torture chamber
897,(F.T.),Who sees the blue through an open casement
898,(F.T.),And hammers his soul to endure the time
899,(F.T.),Of his corporeal abasement;
900,(F.T.),"Nor writhed'st at thine or others' fault,"
901,(F.T.),But with grim tenderness did salt
902,(F.T.),Thy cicatrices with a rhyme.
903,(F.T.),Not the most sable flame of gloom
904,(F.T.),Could penetrate thy inmost room;
905,(F.T.),But through the walls thy spirit sucked
906,(F.T.),Into that cloistral hermitage
907,(F.T.),"Stray lovely things, moonbeams and snows"
908,(F.T.),"The far sky shed into thy cage,"
909,(F.T.),"And, from the very gutter plucked,"
910,(F.T.),A lost and mired campestral rose.
911,(F.T.),
912,(F.T.),"Ended that purgatorial period,"
913,(F.T.),"Filled was thy wallet and thy feet were shod,"
914,(F.T.),"The leaden weights were moved, the rack withdrawn,"
915,(F.T.),"Thou didst traverse the dewy fields of dawn,"
916,(F.T.),"Watch sunsets blazoning over upland turf,"
917,(F.T.),"Pull poppies from the frontiers of the surf,"
918,(F.T.),Dwelled'st with love and human eyes
919,(F.T.),"Vigilant, calm and wise."
920,(F.T.),But still as when thy bark did ride
921,(F.T.),"Derelict on the city's tide,"
922,(F.T.),As then for penury now for pride
923,(F.T.),Thy bodily senses were denied;
924,(F.T.),"Though they cried out and would not sleep,"
925,(F.T.),Ascetic thou didst armour them
926,(F.T.),Lest acid pleasure should eat thine art's pure gem.
927,(F.T.),Hourly the tempter's ambuscades
928,(F.T.),But thou didst guard the gates and keep
929,(F.T.),Thy senses' hungry colonnades
930,(F.T.),"Accessible but to Beauty's ministers,"
931,(F.T.),Unlit by any ruby flame but hers.
932,(F.T.),Immuring so thy spirit eager
933,(F.T.),"Within a body frail and meagre,"
934,(F.T.),"Far from the meads of earthly milk and honey,"
935,(F.T.),"Yet franchised of more wondrous territories,"
936,(F.T.),Like those poor Bedouin of Arabia the Stony
937,(F.T.),Who roam spare-fed and hollow-eyed but free
938,(F.T.),By day to wander and by night to camp
939,(F.T.),"In vast serenity,"
940,(F.T.),Compassed by God's great silent glories
941,(F.T.),"The sun's gold splendour and the moon's white lamp,"
942,(F.T.),Folded and safe from harm
943,(F.T.),Beneath the mighty sky's protecting arm.
944,(F.T.),
945,(F.T.),Ha! but the Titan's ardour
946,(F.T.),"Wherewith thou scour'dst the vast,"
947,(F.T.),To spoil the starry larder
948,(F.T.),Of fruits of heavenly taste!
949,(F.T.),"Urania's fiercest servant,"
950,(F.T.),With thirst as furnace fervent
951,(F.T.),"And serene burning brow,"
952,(F.T.),"Worthy of thy great lineage, thou"
953,(F.T.),Drankest without a shudder
954,(F.T.),In proud humility
955,(F.T.),Milk from that vast primæval udder
956,(F.T.),"That swells for such as thee,"
957,(F.T.),Milk from the fountains of the Universe
958,(F.T.),"That cowards deem infected with a curse,"
959,(F.T.),That flushes him who drinks
960,(F.T.),Nor shrinks
961,(F.T.),The exalted anguish of diurnal draughts
962,(F.T.),"To a clear vision, more intolerable"
963,(F.T.),"In its blissful pain, than love's most ardent shafts,"
964,(F.T.),"Of the seats where she doth dwell,"
965,(F.T.),"She, whom thou didst confess"
966,(F.T.),Enticed
967,(F.T.),Thee hot to her throne to press
968,(F.T.),For the greater glory of Christ
969,(F.T.),To uplift the curtains of her closed eyes.
970,(F.T.),
971,(F.T.),Not all was for thy learning
972,(F.T.),Nor any mortal's else;
973,(F.T.),Only for thy discerning
974,(F.T.),Sporadic syllables
975,(F.T.),Of those supernal glances
976,(F.T.),"Coffer of which her marble countenance is,"
977,(F.T.),"Yet vain was not the adventure,"
978,(F.T.),"Reluctant though the prize,"
979,(F.T.),Thou gainedst a debenture
980,(F.T.),On the fringe of Beauty's eyes;
981,(F.T.),Such fragmentary trophy
982,(F.T.),As some cross-tunic'd knight
983,(F.T.),From Saladin or Sophy
984,(F.T.),"May have won in sword's despite,"
985,(F.T.),Not the dear polar shrines
986,(F.T.),Held captive by the Paynim
987,(F.T.),But still as fruit of wars
988,(F.T.),"Some stone from Sion's lines,"
989,(F.T.),Some relic that might sain him
990,(F.T.),Of life's uncounted scars.
991,(F.T.),
992,(F.T.),"Self-dedicated anchorite,"
993,(F.T.),"Never disdainful of the dust,"
994,(F.T.),But conscious of the overcoming night
995,(F.T.),"That must engulph the blooms and berries of lust,"
996,(F.T.),And unforgetful of the enveloping day beyond;
997,(F.T.),Though a sweet show was spread for thy delight
998,(F.T.),Resolved not to be so fond
999,(F.T.),"As, in ephemeral gauds caparisoned,"
1000,(F.T.),To station feet upon a world of vapour
1001,(F.T.),Soft as a dream and fleeting as a taper;
1002,(F.T.),Thou thoughtest nevertheless that thou shouldst occupy
1003,(F.T.),"Thyself, as it seemed to thee, most worthily"
1004,(F.T.),Until the rapid hour when thou shouldst die;
1005,(F.T.),"So, in a world of seemings,"
1006,(F.T.),"Of shadows and of dreamings,"
1007,(F.T.),Busied thyself to fashion and record
1008,(F.T.),"Unto the greater glory of thy Lord,"
1009,(F.T.),For thy proud lady Beauty His
1010,(F.T.),Most excellent and humble handmaid is.
1011,(F.T.),"Says one thy service was too ceremonial,"
1012,(F.T.),"Thy vestments irised overmuch, thy ritual"
1013,(F.T.),"Too elaborate and thy rubric too obscure,"
1014,(F.T.),Therefore thy gift of chant and orison
1015,(F.T.),Beneath the perfect service men have done.
1016,(F.T.),"O but thy notes were pure,"
1017,(F.T.),And in a day like this we now endure
1018,(F.T.),No fault it was in thee to set thy camp
1019,(F.T.),"Remote, aloof, aloof,"
1020,(F.T.),In a far fastness proof
1021,(F.T.),'Gainst the mephitic odours of the swamp.
1022,(F.T.),"Which being so, no gain"
1023,(F.T.),'Twere to explain
1024,(F.T.),An exquisiteness too meticulous;
1025,(F.T.),"Let us but say it pleased thee thus,"
1026,(F.T.),"Dowered with imagination heavy-fruited,"
1027,(F.T.),To raise a column garlanded and fluted
1028,(F.T.),For Him thy heavenly abacus.
1029,(F.T.),This was thine offering thou didst make
1030,(F.T.),In founded hope that He
1031,(F.T.),The craftsman's best would take
1032,(F.T.),Well knowing its unobscure sincerity.
1033,(F.T.),
1034,(F.T.),The cord broke and the tent
1035,(F.T.),Slipped and the silken roof
1036,(F.T.),Lay prone beneath the viewless hoof
1037,(F.T.),Of the deliberate firmament.
1038,(F.T.),We still in this terrene abode
1039,(F.T.),"Forlorn must tread the difficult road,"
1040,(F.T.),And all meek thanks and all belief
1041,(F.T.),Hardly suffice to rampart grief.
1042,(F.T.),For gone is Beauty's votary apostolic
1043,(F.T.),And are her temples now delivered over
1044,(F.T.),To blindworms and libidinous goats that frolic
1045,(F.T.),In places hallowed by that celestial lover.
1046,(F.T.),Save only two or three
1047,(F.T.),"With undivided minds like thee,"
1048,(F.T.),None now remains that girds
1049,(F.T.),"The peregrinal loin,"
1050,(F.T.),"None reverent of Beauty's holy tongue,"
1051,(F.T.),"But counterfeiters of her imaged coin,"
1052,(F.T.),"Iconoclasts, breakers of carven words,"
1053,(F.T.),"Seekers of worthless treasure in the dung,"
1054,(F.T.),"Mock mages and cacophonous charlatans,"
1055,(F.T.),And pismire artisans
1056,(F.T.),Labouring to make
1057,(F.T.),Such mirrored replicas of Nature's face
1058,(F.T.),As might the surface of a stagnant lake.
1059,(F.T.),
1060,(F.T.),"Yet we should anger not,"
1061,(F.T.),"Nor let that be forgot,"
1062,(F.T.),The testament of stateliest worth
1063,(F.T.),He left us when he fled the earth.
1064,(F.T.),"The mausoleum made of rhyme,"
1065,(F.T.),"Fair in its unfrequented field,"
1066,(F.T.),Which shall invulnerably shield
1067,(F.T.),His memory to the end of Time;
1068,(F.T.),The house with curtain-flaming halls
1069,(F.T.),And roof of gold and jewelled walls
1070,(F.T.),For which the fisher sank his net
1071,(F.T.),"Into the deepest pools of speech,"
1072,(F.T.),Scooping rich conchs and ribbons wet
1073,(F.T.),"That a less venturous could not reach,"
1074,(F.T.),The hunter tracked the metaphor
1075,(F.T.),On many a foamy silver coast
1076,(F.T.),A hundred leagues beyond the most
1077,(F.T.),Fabulous Tellurian shore.
1078,(F.T.),
1079,(F.T.),"Magnificent he was and mild,"
1080,(F.T.),"Glad to be still and glad to speak,"
1081,(F.T.),"Daring yet delicate as a child,"
1082,(F.T.),"Faithful, compassionate and holy,"
1083,(F.T.),"And, being human, strong and weak,"
1084,(F.T.),And full of hope and melancholy.
1085,(F.T.),"No more than we, able to shed"
1086,(F.T.),"Man's nature he inherited,"
1087,(F.T.),"Neither sin's garrison to kill,"
1088,(F.T.),Yet at the last with constancy so great
1089,(F.T.),"As the world's vanities to abnegate,"
1090,(F.T.),Sternly to will the sacrifice of will
1091,(F.T.),"Upon the altars of the Uncreate,"
1092,(F.T.),So that he lived before he died
1093,(F.T.),As one who hourly to himself denied
1094,(F.T.),"All joys save those that cannot pall,"
1095,(F.T.),Who having nothing yet had all.

1109,I,
1110,I,"We slank like stoats and fled like foxes,"
1111,I,"We put cigarettes in the pillar-boxes,"
1112,I,Lighted cigarettes and letters all aflame--
1113,I,O the surprise when the postman came!
1114,I,
1115,I,We stole eggs and apples and made fine hay
1116,I,"In people's houses when people were away,"
1117,I,"We broke street lamps and away we ran,"

1128,II,We met again the other night
1129,II,"With people; you were quite polite,"
1130,II,Shook my hand and spoke awhile
1131,II,Of common things with cautious smile;
1132,II,Paid the usual debt men owe
1133,II,To fellows whom they used to know.
1134,II,"But, when our eyes met full, yours dropped,"
1135,II,"And sudden, resolute, you stopped,"
1136,II,Moving with hurried syllables
1137,II,To make remarks to some one else.
1138,II,"I caught them not, to me they said:"
1139,II,"""Let the dead past bury its dead,"
1140,II,"Things were very different then,"
1141,II,"Boys are fools and men are men."""
1142,II,Several times the other night
1143,II,You did your best to be polite;
1144,II,When in the conversation's round
1145,II,You heard my tongue's familiar sound
1146,II,You bent in eager pose my way
1147,II,To hear what I had got to say;
1148,II,"Trying, you thought with some success,"
1149,II,To hide the chasm's nakedness.
1150,II,But on your eyes hard films there lay;
1151,II,"No mock-interest, no pretence"
1152,II,Could veil your blank indifference;
1153,II,And if thoughts came recalling things
1154,II,"Far-off, far-off, from those old springs"
1155,II,When underneath the moon and sun
1156,II,"Our separate pulses beat as one,"
1157,II,Vagrant tender thoughts that asked
1158,II,Admittance found the portal masked;
1159,II,"You spurned them; when I'd said my say,"
1160,II,With laugh and nod you turned away
1161,II,To toss your friends some easy jest
1162,II,That smote my brow and stabbed my breast.
1163,II,Foolish though it be and vain
1164,II,"I am not master of my pain,"
1165,II,And when I said good-night to you
1166,II,"I hoped we should not meet again,"
1167,II,And wondered how the soul I knew
1168,II,Could change so much; have I changed too?

1173,III,There was a man whom I knew well
1174,III,Whose choice it was to live in hell;
1175,III,Reason there was why that was so
1176,III,But what it was I do not know.
1177,III,
1178,III,"He had a room high in a tower,"
1179,III,"And sat there drinking hour by hour,"
1180,III,"Drinking, drinking all alone"
1181,III,With candles and a wall of stone.
1182,III,
1183,III,"Now and then he sobered down,"
1184,III,And stayed a night with me in town.
1185,III,"If he found me with a crowd,"
1186,III,He shrank and did not speak aloud.
1187,III,
1188,III,"He sat in a corner silently,"
1189,III,And others of the company
1190,III,"Would note his curious face and eye,"
1191,III,His twitching face and timid eye.
1192,III,
1193,III,When they saw the eye he had
1194,III,They thought perhaps that he was mad.
1195,III,I knew he was clear and sane
1196,III,But had a horror in his brain.
1197,III,
1198,III,He had much money and one friend
1199,III,And drank quite grimly to the end.
1200,III,Why he chose to die in hell
1201,III,"I did not ask, he did not tell."

1479,I,"Beneath my skull-bone and my hair,"

1481,I,There is a land: if you looked there
1482,I,What you saw you'd quail to tell.
1483,I,"You that sit there smiling, you"
1484,I,Know that what I say is true.
1485,I,

1491,I,How could countries be in this?
1492,I,
1493,I,"Yet, when I watch with eyelids shut,"
1494,I,"It glimmers forth, now dark, now clear,"
1495,I,"The city of Cis-Occiput,"

1506,II,"The city stands, unstained of sin;"
1507,II,White thoughts and wishes pure
1508,II,Walk the streets with steps demure.
1509,II,
1510,II,In its clean groves and spacious halls
1511,II,The quiet-eyed inhabitants
1512,II,Hold innocent sunny festivals
1513,II,And mingle in decorous dance;
1514,II,"Things that destroy, distort, deface,"
1515,II,Come never to that lovely place.
1516,II,
1517,II,"Never could evil enter thither,"
1518,II,"It could not live in that sweet air,"
1519,II,The shadow of an ill deed must wither
1520,II,And fall away to nothing there.
1521,II,You would say as there you stand
1522,II,That all was beauty in the land.

1531,II,Of sticks and parchèd barrenness.
1532,II,
1533,II,"The middle of the land is this,"
1534,II,"A tawny desert midmost set,"
1535,II,"Barren of living things it is,"
1536,II,Saving at night some vampires flit
1537,II,That nest them in the farther marish
1538,II,Where all save vilest things must perish.
1539,II,
1540,II,Here in this reedy marsh of green
1541,II,"And oily pools, swarm insects fat"
1542,II,"And birds of prey and beasts obscene,"
1543,II,"Things that the traveller shudders at,"
1544,II,All cunning things that creep and fly
1545,II,To suck men's blood until they die.
1546,II,
1547,II,Rarely from hence does aught escape
1548,II,"Into the world of outer light,"
1549,II,But now and then some sable shape
1550,II,Outward will dash in sudden flight;
1551,II,And men stand stonied or distraught
1552,II,To know the loathly deed or thought.
1553,II,
1554,II,"But, ah! beyond the marsh you reach"
1555,II,"A purulent place more vile than all,"
1556,II,"A festering lake too foul for speech,"
1557,II,"Rotten and black, with coils acrawl,"
1558,II,Where writhe with lecherous squeakings shrill
1559,II,Horrors that make the heart stand still.
1560,II,
1561,II,"There, 'neath a heaven diseased, it lies,"
1562,II,"The mere alive with slimy worms,"
1563,II,"With perverse terrible infamies,"
1564,II,And murders and repulsive forms
1565,II,"That have no name, but slide here deep"
1566,II,"Whilst I, their holder, silence keep."

1575,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,
1576,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,
1577,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Not, I suppose, since I deny"
1578,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Appearance is reality,"
1579,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And doubt the substance of the earth
1580,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Does your remonstrance come to birth;
1581,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Not that at once I both affirm
1582,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,'Tis not the skin that makes the worm
1583,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And every tactile thing with mass
1584,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Must find its symbol in the grass
1585,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And with a cool conviction say
1586,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Even a critic's more than clay
1587,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And every dog outlives his day.
1588,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"This kind of vagueness suits your view,"
1589,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,You would not carp at it; for you
1590,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Did never stand with those who take
1591,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Their pleasures in a world opaque.
1592,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,For you a tree would never be
1593,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Lovely were it but a tree,"
1594,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And earthly splendours never splendid
1595,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,If by transience unattended.
1596,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Your eyes are on a farther shore
1597,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Than any of earth; you not adore
1598,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"As godhead God's dead hieroglyph,"
1599,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Nor would you be perturbed if
1600,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Some prophet with a voice of thunder
1601,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And avalanche arm should blast and founder
1602,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,The logical pillars that maintain
1603,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"This visible world which loads the brain,"
1604,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Loads the brain and withers the heart
1605,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And holds man from his God apart.
1606,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,
1607,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,But still with you remains the craving
1608,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"For some more solid substance, having"
1609,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Surface to touch, colour to see,"
1610,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And form compact in symmetry.
1611,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,You are not satisfied with these
1612,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Vague throbbings, utterless ecstasies,"
1613,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Void finds your spirit of delight
1614,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"This great indefinite white light,"
1615,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Not with such sickles can you reap;
1616,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,If a dense earth you cannot keep
1617,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,You want a dense heaven as substitute
1618,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"With trees of plump celestial fruit,"
1619,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Red apples, golden pomegranates,"
1620,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And a river flowing by tall gates
1621,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Of topaz and of chrysolite
1622,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And walls of twenty cubits height.
1623,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,
1624,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Frank, you cry out against the age!"
1625,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Nor you nor I can disengage
1626,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Ourselves from that in which we live
1627,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Nor seize on things God does not give.
1628,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Thirsty as you, perhaps, I long"
1629,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"For courtyards of eternal song,"
1630,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Even as yours my feet would stray
1631,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,In a city where 'tis always day
1632,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And a green spontaneous leafy garden
1633,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,With God in the middle for a warden;
1634,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,But though I trust with strengthening faith
1635,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,I'll taste when I have traversed death
1636,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,The unimaginable sweetness
1637,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Of certitude of such concreteness,"
1638,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,How should I draw the hue and scope
1639,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Of substances I only hope
1640,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Or blaze upon a mortal screen
1641,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,The evidence of things not seen?
1642,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,This art of ours but grows and stirs
1643,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Experience when it registers,"
1644,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And you know well as I know well
1645,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,This autumn of time in which we dwell
1646,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Is not an age of revelations
1647,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Solid as once, but intimations"
1648,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,That touch us with warm misty fingers
1649,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Leaving a nameless sense that lingers
1650,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,That sight is blind and Time's a snare
1651,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And earth less solid than the air
1652,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And deep below all seeming things
1653,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,There sits a steady king of kings
1654,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"A radiant ageless permanence,"
1655,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,A quenchless fount of virtue whence
1656,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,We draw our life; a sense that makes
1657,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,A staunch conviction nothing shakes
1658,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Of our own immortality.
1659,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"And though, being man, with certain glee"
1660,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"I eat and drink, though I suffer pain,"
1661,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And love and hate and love again
1662,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Well or in mode contemptible,"
1663,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Thus shackled by the body's spell
1664,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,I see through pupils of the beast
1665,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Though it be faint and blurred with mist
1666,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,A Star that travels in the East.
1667,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,
1668,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"I see what I can, not what I will"
1669,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"In things that move, things that are still,"
1670,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Thin motion, even cloudier rest,"
1671,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,I see the symbols God hath drest
1672,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"The moveless trees, the trees that wave"
1673,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"The clouds that heavenly highways have,"
1674,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Horses that run, rocks that are fixt,"
1675,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Streams that have rest and motion mixt,"
1676,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"The main with its abiding flux,"
1677,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,The wind that up my chimney sucks
1678,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"A mounting waterfall of flame,"
1679,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Sticks, straws, dust, beetles and that same"
1680,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Old blazing sun the Psalmist saw
1681,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,A testifier to the law.
1682,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Divinely to the heart they speak
1683,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Saying how they are but weak
1684,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Wan will o' the wisps o'er the crystal sea;
1685,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,But stays that sea still dark to me.
1686,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,
1687,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Did I now glibly insolent
1688,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Chart the ulterior firmament,"
1689,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Would you not know my words were lies,"
1690,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Where not my testimonial eyes
1691,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Mortal or spiritual lodge,"
1692,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Mere uncorroborated fudge?
1693,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Praise me, though praise I do not want,"
1694,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Rather, that I have cast much cant,"
1695,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,That what I see and feel I write
1696,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Read what I can in this dim light
1697,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Granted to me in nether night.
1698,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And though I am vague and shrink to guess
1699,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"God's everlasting purposes,"
1700,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And never save in perplext dream
1701,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Have caught the least authentic gleam
1702,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Of the great kingdom and the throne
1703,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"In the world that lies behind our own,"
1704,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"I have not lacked my certainties,"
1705,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"I have not haggard moaned the skies,"
1706,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Now waged unnecessary strife
1707,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Nor scorned nor overvalued life.
1708,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And though you say my attitude
1709,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Is questioning, concede my mood"
1710,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Does never bring to tongue or pen
1711,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Accents of gloomy modern men
1712,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Who wail or hail the death of God
1713,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"And weigh and measure man the clod,"
1714,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Or say they draw reluctant breath
1715,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And musically mourn that Death
1716,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,Is a queen omnipotent of woe
1717,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"And Life her lean cicisbeo,"
1718,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"Abject and pale, whom vampire-like"
1719,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,"She playeth with ere she shall strike,"
1720,A REASONABLE PROTESTATION,And pose sad riddles to the Sphinx

1871,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,

1873,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,The queenly shade of antique Venus thrills
1874,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Scentlike above thy level seas and fills
1875,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Our souls with languor and all amorous things.

1879,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Where the faint sighs of spirits that adore
1880,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"Float like rose-incense through the quiet hours,"
1881,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1882,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,And dovelike sounds each murmured orison:--
1883,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"Cythera lay there barren 'neath bright skies,"
1884,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,A rocky waste rent by discordant cries:
1885,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Natheless I saw a curious thing thereon.
1886,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1887,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"No shady temple was it, close enshrined"
1888,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,I' the trees; no flower-crowned priestess hither came
1889,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"With her young body burnt by secret flame,"
1890,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Baring her breast to the caressing wind;
1891,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1892,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,But when so close to the land's edge we drew
1893,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Our canvas scared the sea-fowl--gradually
1894,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,We knew it for a three-branched gallows tree
1895,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Like a black cypress stark against the blue.
1896,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1897,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"A rotten carcase hung, whereon did sit"
1898,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,A swarm of foul black birds; with writhe and shriek
1899,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Each sought to pierce and plunge his knife-like beak
1900,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Deep in the bleeding trunk and limbs of it.
1901,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1902,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,The eyes were holes; the belly opened wide
1903,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Streaming its heavy entrails on the thighs;
1904,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"The grim birds, gorged with dreadful delicacies,"
1905,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Had dug and furrowed it on every side.
1906,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1907,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Beneath the blackened feet there strove and pressed
1908,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"A herd of jealous beasts with upward snout,"
1909,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,And in the midst of these there turned about
1910,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"One, the chief hangman, larger than the rest...."
1911,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1912,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Lone Cytherean! now all silently
1913,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Thou sufferest these insults to atone
1914,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"For those old infamous sins that thou hast known,"
1915,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,The sins that locked the gate o' the grave to thee.
1916,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1917,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"Mine are thy sorrows, ludicrous corse; yea, all"

1919,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"And, like a bitter vomit, to my teeth"
1920,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,There rose old shadows in a stream of gall.
1921,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1922,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"O thou unhappy devil, I felt afresh,"
1923,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"Gazing at thee, the beaks and jaws of those"
1924,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"Black savage panthers and those ruthless crows,"
1925,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Who loved of old to macerate my flesh.
1926,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1927,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"The sea was calm, the sky without a cloud;"
1928,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Henceforth for me all things that came to pass
1929,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"Were blood and darkness,--round my heart, alas!"
1930,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,"There clung that allegory, like a shroud."
1931,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,
1932,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Naught save mine image on a gibbet thrust
1933,A VOYAGE TO CYTHERA,Found I on Venus island desolate....
