18,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Publisher's Note 
19,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The present volume is made up of poems from Mr. Carman's three latest books, _The Rough Rider_, _Echoes from Vagabondia_, and _April Airs_, together with a number of more recent poems which have not before been issued in book form. "
20,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Bliss Carman: An Appreciation 
21,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"How many Canadians--how many even among the few who seek to keep themselves informed of the best in contemporary literature, who are ever on the alert for the new voices--realise, or even suspect, that this Northern land of theirs has produced a poet of whom it may be affirmed with confidence and assurance that he is of the great succession of English poets?  Yet such--strange and unbelievable though it may seem--is in very truth the case, that poet being (to give him his full name) William Bliss Carman.  Canada has full right to be proud of her poets, a small body though they are; but not only does Mr. Carman stand high and clear above them all--his place (and time cannot but confirm and justify the assertion) is among those men whose poetry is the shining glory of that great English literature which is our common heritage. "
22,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"If any should ask why, if what has been just said is so, there has been--as must be admitted--no general recognition of the fact in the poet's home land, I would answer that there are various and plausible, if not good, reasons for it. "
23,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"First of all, the poet, as thousands more of our young men of ambition and confidence have done, went early to the United States, and until recently, except for rare and brief visits to his old home down by the sea, has never returned to Canada--though for all that, I am able to state, on his own authority, he is still a Canadian citizen.  Then all his books have had their original publication in the United States, and while a few of them have subsequently carried the imprints of Canadian publishers, none of these can be said ever to have made any special effort to push their sale.  Another reason for the fact above mentioned is that Mr. Carman has always scorned to advertise himself, while his work has never been the subject of the log-rolling and booming which the work of many another poet has had--to his ultimate loss.  A further reason is that he follows a rule of his own in preparing his books for publication.  Most poets publish a volume of their work as soon as, through their industry and perseverance, they have material enough on hand to make publication desirable in their eyes.  Not so with Mr. Carman, however, his rule being not to publish until he has done sufficient work of a certain general character or key to make a volume. As a result, you cannot fully know or estimate his work by one book, or two books, or even half a dozen; you must possess or be familiar with every one of the score and more volumes which contain his output of poetry before you can realise how great and how many-sided is his genius. "
24,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"It is a common remark on the part of those who respond readily to the vigorous work of Kipling, or Masefield, even our own Service, that Bliss Carman's poetry has no relation to or concern with ordinary, everyday life.  One would suppose that most persons who cared for poetry at all turned to it as a relief from or counter to the burdens and vexations of the daily round; but in any event, the remark referred to seems to me to indicate either the most casual acquaintance with Mr. Carman's work, or a complete misunderstanding and misapprehension of the meaning of it.  I grant that you will find little or nothing in it all to remind you of the grim realities and vexing social problems of this modern existence of ours; but to say or to suggest that these things do not exist for Mr. Carman is to say or to suggest something which is the reverse of true.  The truth is, he is aware of them as only one with the sensitive organism of a poet can be; but he does not feel that he has a call or mission to remedy them, and still less to sing of them.  He therefore leaves the immediate problems of the day to those who choose, or are led, to occupy themselves therewith, and turns resolutely away to dwell upon those things which for him possess infinitely greater importance. "
25,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"""What are they?"" one who knows Mr. Carman only as, say, a lyrist of spring or as a singer of the delights of vagabondia probably will ask in some wonder.  Well, the things which concern him above all, I would answer, are first, and naturally, the beauty and wonder of this world of ours, and next the mystery of the earthly pilgrimage of the human soul out of eternity and back into it again. "
26,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The poems in the present volume--which, by the way, can boast the high honor of being the very first regular Canadian edition of his work--will be evidence ample and conclusive to every reader, I am sure, of the place which "
27,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The perennial enchanted Lovely world and all its lore 
28,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"occupy in the heart and soul of Bliss Carman, as well as of the magical power with which he is able to convey the deep and unfailing satisfaction and delight which they possess for him.  They, however, represent his latest period (he has had three well-defined periods), comprising selections from three of his last published volumes: _The Rough Rider_, _Echoes from Vagabondia_, and _April Airs_, together with a number of new poems, and do not show, except here and there and by hints and flashes, how great is his preoccupation with the problem of man's existence-- "
29,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,the hidden import Of man's eternal plight. 
30,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"This is manifest most in certain of his earlier books, for in these he turns and returns to the greatest of all the problems of man almost constantly, probing, with consummate and almost unrivalled use of the art of expression, for the secret which surely, he clearly feels, lies hidden somewhere, to be discovered if one could but pierce deeply enough.  Pick up _Behind the Arras_, and as you turn over page after page you cannot but observe how incessantly the poet's mind--like the minds of his two great masters, Browning and Whitman--works at this problem.  In ""Behind the Arras,"" the title poem; ""In the Wings,"" ""The Crimson House,"" ""The Lodger,"" ""Beyond the Gamut,"" ""The Juggler""--yes, in every poem in the book--he takes up and handles the strange thing we know as, or call, life, turning it now this way, now that, in an effort to find out its meaning and purpose.  He comes but little nearer success in this than do most of the rest of men, of course; but the magical and ever-fresh beauty of his expression, the haunting melody of his lines, the variety of his images and figures and the depth and range of his thought, put his searchings and ponderings in a class by themselves. "
31,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Lengthy quotation from Mr. Carman's books is not permitted here, and I must guide myself accordingly, though with reluctance, because I believe that in a study such as this the subject should be allowed to speak for himself as much as possible.  In ""Behind the Arras"" the poet describes the passage from life to death as "
32,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"A cadence dying down unto its source In music's course, "
33,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,and goes on to speak of death as 
34,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"the broken rhythm of thought and man, The sweep and span Of memory and hope About the orbit where they still must grope For wider scope, "
35,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"To be through thousand springs restored, renewed, With love imbrued, With increments of will Made strong, perceiving unattainment still From each new skill. "
36,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Now follow some verses from ""Behind the Gamut,"" to my mind the poet's greatest single achievement; "
37,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"As fine sand spread on a disc of silver, At some chord which bids the motes combine, Heeding the hidden and reverberant impulse, Shifts and dances into curve and line, "
38,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The round earth, too, haply, like a dust-mote, Was set whirling her assigned sure way, Round this little orb of her ecliptic To some harmony she must obey. "
39,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And what of man? 
40,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Linked to all his half-accomplished fellows, Through unfrontiered provinces to range-- Man is but the morning dream of nature, Roused to some wild cadence weird and strange. "
41,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Here, now, are some verses from ""Pulvis et Umbra,"" which is to be found in Mr. Carman's first book, _Low Tide on Grand Pr√©_, and in which the poet addresses a moth which a storm has blown into his window: "
42,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"For man walks the world with mourning Down to death and leaves no trace, With the dust upon his forehead, And the shadow on his face. "
43,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Pillared dust and fleeing shadow As the roadside wind goes by, And the fourscore years that vanish In the twinkling of an eye. "
44,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"""Pillared dust and fleeing shadow.""  Where in all our English literature will one find the life history of man summed up more briefly and, at the same time, more beautifully, than in that wonderful line? Now follows a companion verse to those just quoted, taken from ""Lord of My Heart's Elation,"" which stands in the forefront of _From the Green Book of the Bards_.  It may be remarked here that while the poet recurs again and again to some favorite thought or idea, it is never in the same words.  His expression is always new and fresh, showing how deep and true is his inspiration.  Again it is man who is pictured: "
45,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"A fleet and shadowy column Of dust and mountain rain, To walk the earth a moment And be dissolved again. "
46,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"But while Mr. Carman's speculations upon life's meaning and the mystery of the future cannot but appeal to the thoughtful-minded, it is as an interpreter of nature that he makes his widest appeal.  Bliss Carman, I must say here, and emphatically, is no mere landscape-painter; he never, or scarcely ever, paints a picture of nature for its own sake. He goes beyond the outward aspect of things and interprets or translates for us with less keen senses as only a poet whose feeling for nature is of the deepest and profoundest, who has gone to her whole-heartedly and been taken close to her warm bosom, can do.  Is this not evident from these verses from ""The Great Return""--originally called ""The Pagan's Prayer,"" and for some inscrutable reason to be found only in the limited _Collected Poems_, issued in two stately volumes in 1905 (1904)? "
47,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"When I have lifted up my heart to thee, Thou hast ever hearkened and drawn near, And bowed thy shining face close over me, Till I could hear thee as the hill-flowers hear. "
48,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"When I have cried to thee in lonely need, Being but a child of thine bereft and wrung, Then all the rivers in the hills gave heed; And the great hill-winds in thy holy tongue-- "
49,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"That ancient incommunicable speech-- The April stars and autumn sunsets know-- Soothed me and calmed with solace beyond reach Of human ken, mysterious and low. "
50,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Who can read or listen to those moving lines without feeling that Mr. Carman is in very truth a poet of nature--nay, Nature's own poet?  But how could he be other when, in ""The Breath of the Reed"" (_From the Green Book of the Bards_), he makes the appeal? "
51,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Make me thy priest, O Mother, And prophet of thy mood, With all the forest wonder Enraptured and imbued. "
52,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"As becomes such a poet, and particularly a poet whose birth-month is April, Mr. Carman sings much of the early spring.  Again and again he takes up his woodland pipe, and lo! Pan himself and all his train troop joyously before us.  Yet the singer's notes for all his singing never become wearied or strident; his airs are ever new and fresh; his latest songs are no less spontaneous and winning than were his first, written how many years ago, while at the same time they have gained in beauty and melody.  What heart will not stir to the vibrant music of his immortal ""Spring Song,"" which was originally published in the first _Songs from Vagabondia_, and the opening verses of which follow? "
53,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Make me over, mother April, When the sap begins to stir! When thy flowery hand delivers All the mountain-prisoned rivers, And thy great heart beats and quivers To revive the days that were, Make me over, mother April, When the sap begins to stir! "
54,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Take my dust and all my dreaming, Count my heart-beats one by one, Send them where the winters perish; Then some golden noon recherish And restore them in the sun, Flower and scent and dust and dreaming, With their heart-beats every one! "
55,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"That poem is sufficient in itself to prove that Bliss Carman has full right and title to be called Spring's own lyrist, though it may be remarked here that not all his spring poems are so unfeignedly joyous. Many of them indeed, have a touch, or more than a touch, of wistfulness, for the poet knows well that sorrow lurks under all joy, deep and well hidden though it may be. "
56,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Mr. Carman sings equally finely, though perhaps not so frequently, of summer and the other seasons; but as he has other claims upon our attention, I shall forbear to labor the fact, particularly as the following collection demonstrates it sufficiently.  One of those other claims is as a writer of sea poetry.  Few poets, it may be said, have pictured the majesty and the mystery, the beauty and the terror of the sea, better than he.  His _Ballads of Lost Haven_ is a veritable treasure-house for those whose spirits find kinship in wide expanses of moving waters.  One of the best known poems in this volume is ""The Gravedigger,"" which opens thus: "
57,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Oh, the shambling sea is a sexton old, And well his work is done. With an equal grave for lord and knave, He buries them every one. "
58,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Then hoy and rip, with a rolling hip, He makes for the nearest shore; And God, who sent him a thousand ship, Will send him a thousand more; But some he'll save for a bleaching grave, And shoulder them in to shore-- Shoulder them in, shoulder them in, Shoulder them in to shore. "
59,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In ""The City of the Sea"" (_Last Songs from Vagabondia_) Mr. Carman speaks of the seabells sounding "
60,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The eternal cadence of sea sorrow For Man's lot and immemorial wrong-- The lost strains that haunt the human dwelling With the ghost of song. 
61,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Elsewhere he speaks of 
62,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The great sea, mystic and musical. "
63,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And here from another poem is a striking picture: 
64,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,... the old sea Seems to whimper and deplore Mourning like a childless crone With her sorrow left alone-- The eternal human cry To the heedless passer-by. 
65,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"I have said above that Mr. Carman has had three distinct periods, and intimated that the poems in the following collection are of his third period.  The first period may be said to be represented by the _Low Tide_ and _Behind the Arras_ volumes, while the second is displayed in the three volumes of _Songs from Vagabondia_, which he published in association with his friend Richard Hovey.  Bliss Carman was from the first too original and individual a poet to be directly influenced by anyone else; but there can be no doubt that his friendship with Hovey helped to turn him from over-preoccupation with mysteries which, for all their greatness, are not for man to solve, to an intenser realisation of the beauty and loveliness of the world about him and of the joys of human fellowship.  The result is seen in such poems as ""Spring Song,"" quoted in part above, and his perhaps equally well-known ""The Joys of the Road,"" which appeared in the same volume with that poem, and a few verses from which follow: "
66,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Now the joys of the road are chiefly these: A crimson touch on the hardwood trees; 
67,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"A vagrant's morning wide and blue, In early fall, when the wind walks, too; "
68,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"A shadowy highway cool and brown, Alluring up and enticing down "
69,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"From rippled waters and dappled swamp, From purple glory to scarlet pomp; "
70,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The outward eye, the quiet will, And the striding heart from hill to hill. "
71,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Some of the finest of Mr. Carman's work is contained in his elegiac or memorial poems, in which he commemorates Keats, Shelley, William Blake, Lincoln, Stevenson, and other men for whom he has a kindred feeling, and also friends whom he has loved and lost.  Listen to these moving lines from ""Non Omnis Moriar,"" written in memory of Gleeson White, and to be found in _Last Songs from Vagabondia_: "
72,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"There is a part of me that knows, Beneath incertitude and fear, I shall not perish when I pass Beyond mortality's frontier; "
73,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"But greatly having joyed and grieved, Greatly content, shall hear the sigh Of the strange wind across the lone Bright lands of taciturnity. "
74,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In patience therefore I await My friend's unchanged benign regard,-- Some April when I too shall be Spilt water from a broken shard. "
75,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In ""The White Gull,"" written for the centenary of the birth of Shelley in 1892, and included in _By the Aurelian Wall_, he thus apostrophizes that clear and shining spirit: "
76,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"O captain of the rebel host, Lead forth and far! Thy toiling troopers of the night Press on the unavailing fight; The sombre field is not yet lost, With thee for star. "
77,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Thy lips have set the hail and haste Of clarions free To bugle down the wintry verge Of time forever, where the surge Thunders and trembles on a waste And open sea. "
78,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In ""A Seamark,"" a threnody for Robert Louis Stevenson, which appears in the same volume, the poet hails ""R.L.S."" (of whose tribe he may be said to be truly one) as "
79,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The master of the roving kind, "
80,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,and goes on: 
81,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"O all you hearts about the world In whom the truant gypsy blood, Under the frost of this pale time, Sleeps like the daring sap and flood That dreams of April and reprieve! You whom the haunted vision drives, Incredulous of home and ease. Perfection's lovers all your lives! "
82,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"You whom the wander-spirit loves To lead by some forgotten clue Forever vanishing beyond Horizon brinks forever new; Our restless loved adventurer, On secret orders come to him, Has slipped his cable, cleared the reef, And melted on the white sea-rim. "
83,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"""Perfection's lovers all your lives.""  Of these, it may be said without qualification, is Bliss Carman himself. "
84,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"No summary of Mr. Carman's work, however cursory, would be worthy of the name if it omitted mention of his ventures in the realm of Greek myth.  _From the Book of Myths_ is made up of work of that sort, every poem in it being full of the beauty of phrase and melody of which Mr. Carman alone has the secret.  The finest poems in the book, barring the opening one, ""Overlord,"" are ""Daphne,"" ""The Dead Faun,"" ""Hylas,"" and ""At Ph√¶dra's Tomb,"" but I can do no more here than name them, for extracts would fail to reveal their full beauty.  And beauty, after all is said, is the first and last thing with Mr. Carman.  As he says himself somewhere: "
85,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The joy of the hand that hews for beauty Is the dearest solace under the sun. 
86,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,And again 
87,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,The eternal slaves of beauty Are the masters of the world. 
88,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"A slave--a happy, willing slave--to beauty is the poet himself, and the world can never repay him for the message of beauty which he has brought it. "
89,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Kindred to _From the Book of Myths_, but much more important, is _Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics_, one of the most successful of the numerous attempts which have been made to recapture the poems by that high priestess of song which remain to us only in fragments.  Mr. Carman, as Charles G. D. Roberts points out in an introduction to the volume, has made no attempt here at translation or paraphrasing; his venture has been ""the most perilous and most alluring in the whole field of poetry""--that of imaginative and, at the same time, interpretive construction.  Brief quotation again would fail to convey an adequate idea of the exquisiteness of the work, and all I can do, therefore, is to urge all lovers of real poetry to possess themselves of _Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics_, for it is literally a storehouse of lyric beauty. "
90,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"I must not fail here to speak of _From the Book of Valentines_, which contains some lovely things, notably ""At the Great Release.""  This is not only one of the finest of all Mr. Carman's poems, but it is also one of the finest poems of our time.  It is a love poem, and no one possessing any real feeling for poetry can read it without experiencing that strange thrill of the spirit which only the highest form of poetry can communicate.  ""Morning and Evening,"" ""In an Iris Meadow,"" and ""A letter from Lesbos"" must be also mentioned.  In the last named poem, Sappho is represented as writing to Gorgo, and expresses herself in these moving words: "
91,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"If the high gods in that triumphant time Have calendared no day for thee to come Light-hearted to this doorway as of old, Unmoved I shall behold their pomps go by-- The painted seasons in their pageantry, The silvery progressions of the moon, And all their infinite ardors unsubdued, Pass with the wind replenishing the earth "
92,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Incredulous forever I must live And, once thy lover, without joy behold, The gradual uncounted years go by, Sharing the bitterness of all things made. "
93,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Mention must be now made of _Songs of the Sea Children_, which can be described only as a collection of the sweetest and tenderest love lyrics written in our time-- "
94,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"the lyric songs The earthborn children sing, When wild-wood laughter throngs The shy bird-throats of spring; When there's not a joy of the heart But flies like a flag unfurled, And the swelling buds bring back The April of the world. "
95,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"So perfect and complete are these lyrics that it would be almost sacrilege to quote any of them unless entire.  Listen however, to these verses: "
96,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The day is lost without thee, The night has not a star. Thy going is an empty room Whose door is left ajar. "
97,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,Depart: it is the footfall Of twilight on the hills. Return: and every rood of ground Breaks into daffodils. 
98,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"There are those who will have it that Bliss Carman has been away from Canada so long that he has ceased to be, in a real sense, a Canadian. Such assume rather than know, for a very little study of his work would show them that it is shot through and through with the poet's feeling for the land of his birth.  Memories of his childhood and youthful years down by the sea are still fresh in Mr. Carman's mind, and inspire him again and again in his writing.  ""A Remembrance,"" at the beginning of the present collection, may be pointed to as a striking instance of this, but proof positive is the volume, _Songs from a Northern Garden_, for it could have been written only by a Canadian, born and bred, one whose heart and soul thrill to the thought of Canada.  I would single out from this volume for special mention as being ""Canadian"" in the fullest sense ""In a Grand Pr√© Garden,"" ""The Keeper's Silence,"" ""At Home and Abroad,"" ""Killoleet,"" and ""Above the Gaspereau,"" but have no space to quote from them. "
99,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"But Mr. Carman is not only a Canadian, he is also a Briton; and evidence of this is his _Ode on the Coronation_, written on the occasion of the crowning of King Edward VII in 1902.  This poem--the very existence of which is hardly known among us--ought to be put in the hands of every child and youth who speaks the English tongue, for no other, I dare maintain--nothing by Kipling, or Newbolt, or any other of our so-called ""Imperial singers""--expresses more truly and more movingly the deep feeling of love and reverence which the very thought of England evokes in every son of hers, even though it may never have been his to see her white cliffs rise or to tread her storied ground: "
100,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"O England, little mother by the sleepless Northern tide, Having bred so many nations to devotion, trust, and pride, Very tenderly we turn With welling hearts that yearn Still to love you and defend you,--let the sons of men discern Wherein your right and title, might and majesty, reside. "
101,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"In concluding this, I greatly fear, lamentably inadequate study, I come to the collection which follows, and which, as intimated above, represents the work of Mr. Carman's latest period.  I must say at once that, while I yield to no one in admiration for _Low Tide_ and the other books of that period, or for the work of the second period, as represented by the _Songs from Vagabondia_ volumes, I have no hesitation in declaring that I regard the poet's work of the past few years with even higher admiration.  It may not possess the force and vigor of the work which preceded it; but anything seemingly missing in that respect is more than made up for me by increased beauty and clarity of expression.  The mysticism--verging, or more than verging, at times on symbolism--which marked his earlier poems, and which hung, as it were, as a veil between them and the reader, has gone, and the poet's thought or theme now lies clearly before us as in a mirror. What--to take a verse from the following pages at random--could be more pellucid, more crystal clear in expression--what indeed, could come closer to that achieving of the impossible at which every real poet must aim--than this from ""In Gold Lacquer"" (page 12)? "
102,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"Gold are the great trees overhead, And gold the leaf-strewn grass, As though a cloth of gold were spread To let a seraph pass. And where the pageant should go by, Meadow and wood and stream, The world is all of lacquered gold, Expectant as a dream. "
103,PUBLISHERS -- TORONTO,"The poet, happily, has fully recovered from the serious illness which laid him low some two years ago, and which for a time caused his friends and admirers the gravest concern, and so we may look forward hopefully to seeing further volumes of verse come from the press to make certain his name and fame.  But if, for any reason, this should not be--which the gods forfend!--_Later Poems_, I dare affirm, must and will be regarded as the fine flower and crowning achievement of the genius and art of Bliss Carman.

137,THE GATE OF PEACE,Later Poems 
138,THE GATE OF PEACE,Vestigia. 
139,THE GATE OF PEACE,"_I took a day to search for God, And found Him not.  But as I trod By rocky ledge, through woods untamed, Just where one scarlet lily flamed, I saw His footprint in the sod._ "
140,THE GATE OF PEACE,"_Then suddenly, all unaware, Far off in the deep shadows, where A solitary hermit thrush Sang through the holy twilight hush-- I heard His voice upon the air._ "
141,THE GATE OF PEACE,"_And even as I marvelled how God gives us Heaven here and now, In a stir of wind that hardly shook The poplar leaves beside the brook-- His hand was light upon my brow._ "
142,THE GATE OF PEACE,"_At last with evening as I turned Homeward, and thought what I had learned And all that there was still to probe-- I caught the glory of His robe Where the last fires of sunset burned._ "
143,THE GATE OF PEACE,_Back to the world with quickening start I looked and longed for any part In making saving Beauty be.... And from that kindling ecstasy I knew God dwelt within my heart._ 
144,THE GATE OF PEACE,A Remembrance. 
145,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Here in lovely New England When summer is come, a sea-turn Flutters a page of remembrance In the volume of long ago. "
146,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Soft is the wind over Grand Pr√©, Stirring the heads of the grasses, Sweet is the breath of the orchards White with their apple-blow. "
147,THE GATE OF PEACE,"There at their infinite business Of measuring time forever, Murmuring songs of the sea, The great tides come and go. "
148,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Over the dikes and the uplands Wander the great cloud shadows, Strange as the passing of sorrow, Beautiful, solemn, and slow. "
149,THE GATE OF PEACE,"For, spreading her old enchantment Of tender ineffable wonder, Summer is there in the Northland! How should my heart not know? "
150,THE GATE OF PEACE,The Ships of Yule 
151,THE GATE OF PEACE,"When I was just a little boy, Before I went to school, I had a fleet of forty sail I called the Ships of Yule; "
152,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Of every rig, from rakish brig And gallant barkentine, To little Fundy fishing boats With gunwales painted green. "
153,THE GATE OF PEACE,"They used to go on trading trips Around the world for me, For though I had to stay on shore My heart was on the sea. "
154,THE GATE OF PEACE,"They stopped at every port to call From Babylon to Rome, To load with all the lovely things We never had at home; "
155,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With elephants and ivory Bought from the King of Tyre, And shells and silk and sandal-wood That sailor men admire; "
156,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With figs and dates from Samarcand, And squatty ginger-jars, And scented silver amulets From Indian bazaars; "
157,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With sugar-cane from Port of Spain, And monkeys from Ceylon, And paper lanterns from Pekin With painted dragons on; "
158,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With cocoanuts from Zanzibar, And pines from Singapore; And when they had unloaded these They could go back for more. "
159,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And even after I was big And had to go to school, My mind was often far away Aboard the Ships of Yule. "
160,THE GATE OF PEACE,The Ships of Saint John 
161,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Where are the ships I used to know, That came to port on the Fundy tide Half a century ago, In beauty and stately pride? "
162,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In they would come past the beacon light, With the sun on gleaming sail and spar, Folding their wings like birds in flight From countries strange and far. "
163,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Schooner and brig and barkentine, I watched them slow as the sails were furled, And wondered what cities they must have seen On the other side of the world. "
164,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Frenchman and Britisher and Dane, Yankee, Spaniard and Portugee, And many a home ship back again With her stories of the sea. "
165,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Calm and victorious, at rest From the relentless, rough sea-play, The wild duck on the river's breast Was not more sure than they. "
166,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The creatures of a passing race, The dark spruce forests made them strong, The sea's lore gave them magic grace, The great winds taught them song. "
167,THE GATE OF PEACE,And God endowed them each with life-- His blessing on the craftsman's skill-- To meet the blind unreasoned strife And dare the risk of ill. 
168,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Not mere insensate wood and paint Obedient to the helm's command, But often restive as a saint Beneath the Heavenly hand. "
169,THE GATE OF PEACE,"All the beauty and mystery Of life were there, adventure bold, Youth, and the glamour of the sea And all its sorrows old. "
170,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And many a time I saw them go Out on the flood at morning brave, As the little tugs had them in tow, And the sunlight danced on the wave. "
171,THE GATE OF PEACE,"There all day long you could hear the sound Of the caulking iron, the ship's bronze bell, And the clank of the capstan going round As the great tides rose and fell. "
172,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The sailors' songs, the Captain's shout, The boatswain's whistle piping shrill, And the roar as the anchor chain runs out,-- I often hear them still. "
173,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I can see them still, the sun on their gear, The shining streak as the hulls careen, And the flag at the peak unfurling,--clear As a picture on a screen. "
174,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The fog still hangs on the long tide-rips, The gulls go wavering to and fro, But where are all the beautiful ships I knew so long ago? "
175,THE GATE OF PEACE,The Garden of Dreams 
176,THE GATE OF PEACE,"My heart is a garden of dreams Where you walk when day is done, Fair as the royal flowers, Calm as the lingering sun. "
177,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Never a drouth comes there, Nor any frost that mars, Only the wind of love Under the early stars,-- "
178,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The living breath that moves Whispering to and fro, Like the voice of God in the dusk Of the garden long ago. "
179,THE GATE OF PEACE,Garden Magic 
180,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Within my stone-walled garden (I see her standing now, Uplifted in the twilight, With glory on her brow!) "
181,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love to walk at evening And watch, when winds are low, The new moon in the tree-tops, Because she loved it so! "
182,THE GATE OF PEACE,"And there entranced I listen, While flowers and winds confer, And all their conversation Is redolent of her. "
183,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the trees that guard it, Upstanding and serene, So noble, so undaunted, Because that was her mien. "
184,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the brook that bounds it, Because its silver voice Is like her bubbling laughter That made the world rejoice. "
185,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the golden jonquils, Because she used to say, If soul could choose a color It would be clothed as they. "
186,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the blue-gray iris, Because her eyes were blue, Sea-deep and heaven-tender In meaning and in hue. "
187,THE GATE OF PEACE,"I love the small wild roses, Because she used to stand Adoringly above them And bless them with her hand. "
188,THE GATE OF PEACE,"These were her boon companions. But more than all the rest I love the April lilac, Because she loved it best. "
189,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Soul of undying rapture! How love's enchantment clings, With sorcery and fragrance, About familiar things! "
190,THE GATE OF PEACE,In Gold Lacquer 
191,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Gold are the great trees overhead, And gold the leaf-strewn grass, As though a cloth of gold were spread To let a seraph pass. And where the pageant should go by, Meadow and wood and stream, The world is all of lacquered gold, Expectant as a dream. "
192,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Against the sunset's burning gold, Etched in dark monotone Behind its alley of grey trees And gateposts of grey stone, Stands the Old Manse, about whose eaves An air of mystery clings, Abandoned to the lonely peace Of bygone ghostly things. "
193,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In molten gold the river winds With languid sweep and turn, Beside the red-gold wooded hill Yellowed with ash and fern. The streets are tiled with gold-green shade And arched with fretted gold, Ecstatic aisles that richly thread This minster grim and old. "
194,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The air is flecked with filtered gold,-- The shimmer of romance Whose ageless glamour still must hold The world as in a trance, Pouring o'er every time and place Light of an amber sea, The spell of all the gladsome things That have been or shall be. "
195,THE GATE OF PEACE,Aprilian 
196,THE GATE OF PEACE,"When April came with sunshine And showers and lilac bloom, My heart with sudden gladness Was like a fragrant room. "
197,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Her eyes were heaven's own azure, As deep as God's own truth. Her soul was made of rapture And mystery and youth. "
198,THE GATE OF PEACE,"She knew the sorry burden Of all the ancient years, Yet could not dwell with sadness And memory and tears. "
199,THE GATE OF PEACE,"With her there was no shadow Of failure nor despair, But only loving joyance. O Heart, how glad we were! "
200,THE GATE OF PEACE,Garden Shadows 
201,THE GATE OF PEACE,"When the dawn winds whisper To the standing corn, And the rose of morning From the dark is born, All my shadowy garden Seems to grow aware Of a fragrant presence, Half expected there. "
202,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In the golden shimmer Of the burning noon, When the birds are silent And the poppies swoon, Once more I behold her Smile and turn her face, With its infinite regard, Its immortal grace. "
203,THE GATE OF PEACE,"When the twilight silvers Every nodding flower, And the new moon hallows The first evening hour, Is it not her footfall Down the garden walks, Where the drowsy blossoms Slumber on their stalks? "
204,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In the starry quiet, When the soul is free, And a vernal message Stirs the lilac tree, Surely I have felt her Pass and brush my cheek, With the eloquence of love That does not need to speak! "
205,THE GATE OF PEACE,In The Day of Battle 
206,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In the day of battle, In the night of dread, Let one hymn be lifted, Let one prayer be said. "
207,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Not for pride of conquest, Not for vengeance wrought, Nor for peace and safety With dishonour bought! "
208,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Praise for faith in freedom, Our fighting fathers' stay, Born of dreams and daring, Bred above dismay. "
209,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Prayer for cloudless vision, And the valiant hand, That the right may triumph To the last demand. "
210,THE GATE OF PEACE,Trees 
211,THE GATE OF PEACE,"In the Garden of Eden, planted by God, There were goodly trees in the springing sod,-- "
212,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Trees of beauty and height and grace, To stand in splendor before His face. "
213,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Apple and hickory, ash and pear, Oak and beech and the tulip rare, "
214,THE GATE OF PEACE,"The trembling aspen, the noble pine, The sweeping elm by the river line; "
215,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Trees for the birds to build and sing, And the lilac tree for a joy in spring; "
216,THE GATE OF PEACE,Trees to turn at the frosty call And carpet the ground for their Lord's footfall; 
217,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Trees for fruitage and fire and shade, Trees for the cunning builder's trade; "
218,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Wood for the bow, the spear, and the flail, The keel and the mast of the daring sail; "
219,THE GATE OF PEACE,He made them of every grain and girth For the use of man in the Garden of Earth. 
220,THE GATE OF PEACE,"Then lest the soul should not lift her eyes From the gift to the Giver of Paradise, "
221,THE GATE OF PEACE,"On the crown of a hill, for all to see, God planted a scarlet maple tree. "
222,THE GATE OF PEACE,The Givers of Life 
223,I,I 
224,I,"Who called us forth out of darkness and gave us the gift of life, Who set our hands to the toiling, our feet in the field of strife? "
225,I,"Darkly they mused, predestined to knowledge of viewless things, Sowing the seed of wisdom, guarding the living springs. "
226,I,"Little they reckoned privation, hunger or hardship or cold, If only the life might prosper, and the joy that grows not old. "
227,I,"With sorceries subtler than music, with knowledge older than speech, Gentle as wind in the wheat-field, strong as the tide on the beach, "
228,I,"Out of their beauty and longing, out of their raptures and tears, In patience and pride they bore us, to war with the warring years. "
229,II,II 
230,II,"Who looked on the world before them, and summoned and chose our sires, Subduing the wayward impulse to the will of their deep desires? "
231,II,"Sovereigns of ultimate issues under the greater laws, Theirs was the mystic mission of the eternal cause; "
232,II,"Confident, tender, courageous, leaving the low for the higher, Lifting the feet of the nations out of the dust and the mire; Luring civilization on to the fair and new, Given God's bidding to follow, having God's business to do. "
233,III,III 
234,III,"Who strengthened our souls with courage, and taught us the ways of Earth? Who gave us our patterns of beauty, our standards of flawless worth? "
235,III,"Mothers, unmilitant, lovely, moulding our manhood then, Walked in their woman's glory, swaying the might of men. "
236,III,"They schooled us to service and honor, modest and clean and fair,-- The code of their worth of living, taught with the sanction of prayer. They were our sharers of sorrow, they were our makers of joy, Lighting the lamp of manhood in the heart of the lonely boy. "
237,III,"Haloed with love and with wonder, in sheltered ways they trod, Seers of sublime divination, keeping the truce of God. "
238,IV,IV 
239,IV,"Who called us from youth and dreaming, and set ambition alight, And made us fit for the contest,--men, by their tender rite? "
240,IV,"Sweethearts above our merit, charming our strength and skill To be the pride of their loving, to be the means of their will. "
241,IV,"If we be the builders of beauty, if we be the masters of art, Theirs were the gleaming ideals, theirs the uplift of the heart. "
242,IV,"Truly they measure the lightness of trappings and ease and fame, For the teeming desire of their yearning is ever and ever the same: "
243,IV,"To crown their lovers with gladness, to clothe their sons with delight, And see the men of their making lords in the best man's right. "
244,IV,"Lavish of joy and labor, broken only by wrong, These are the guardians of being, spirited, sentient and strong. "
245,IV,"Theirs is the starry vision, theirs the inspiriting hope, Since Night, the brooding enchantress, promised that day should ope. "
246,V,V 
247,V,"Lo, we have built and invented, reasoned, discovered and planned, To rear us a palace of splendor, and make us a heaven by hand. "
248,V,"We are shaken with dark misgiving, as kingdoms rise and fall; But the women who went to found them are never counted at all. "
249,V,"Versed in the soul's traditions, skilled in humanity's lore, They wait for their crown of rapture, and weep for the sins of war. "
250,V,"And behold they turn from our triumphs, as it was in the first of days, For a little heaven of ardor and a little heartening of praise. "
251,V,"These are the rulers of kingdoms beyond the domains of state, Martyrs of all men's folly, over-rulers of fate. These we will love and honor, these we will serve and defend, Fulfilling the pride of nature, till nature shall have an end. "
252,VI,VI 
253,VI,"This is the code unwritten, this is the creed we hold, Guarding the little and lonely, gladdening the helpless and old,-- "
254,VI,"Apart from the brunt of the battle our wondrous women shall bide, For the sake of a tranquil wisdom and the need of a spirit's guide. "
255,VI,"Come they into assembly, or keep they another door, Our makers of life shall lighten the days as the years of yore. "
256,VI,"The lure of their laughter shall lead us, the lilt of their words shall sway. Though life and death should defeat us, their solace shall be our stay. "
257,VI,"Veiled in mysterious beauty, vested in magical grace, They have walked with angels at twilight and looked upon glory's face. "
258,VI,"Life we will give for their safety, care for their fruitful ease, Though we break at the toiling benches or go down in the smoky seas. "
259,VI,"This is the gospel appointed to govern a world of men. Till love has died, and the echoes have whispered the last Amen. "
260,VI,A Fireside Vision 
261,VI,"Once I walked the world enchanted Through the scented woods of spring, Hand in hand with Love, in rapture Just to hear a bluebird sing. "
262,VI,"Now the lonely winds of autumn Moan about my gusty eaves, As I sit beside the fire Listening to the flying leaves. "
263,VI,"As the dying embers settle And the twilight falls apace, Through the gloom I see a vision Full of ardor, full of grace. "
264,VI,"When the Architect of Beauty Breathed the lyric soul in man, Lo, the being that he fashioned Was of such a mould and plan! "
265,VI,"Bravely through the deepening shadows Moves that figure half divine, With its tenderness of bearing, With its dignity of line. "
266,VI,"Eyes more wonderful than evening With the new moon on the hill, Mouth with traces of God's humor In its corners lurking still. "
267,VI,"Ah, she smiles, in recollection; Lays a hand upon my brow; Rests this head upon Love's bosom! Surely it is April now! "
268,VI,A Water Color 
269,VI,"There's a picture in my room Lightens many an hour of gloom,-- "
270,VI,Cheers me under fortune's frown And the drudgery of town. 
271,VI,"Many and many a winter day When my soul sees all things gray, "
272,VI,"Here is veritable June, Heart's content and spirit's boon. "
273,VI,"It is scarce a hand-breadth wide, Not a span from side to side, "
274,VI,"Yet it is an open door Looking back to joy once more, "
275,VI,"Where the level marshes lie, A quiet journey of the eye, "
276,VI,And the unsubstantial blue Makes the fine illusion true. 
277,VI,"So I forth and travel there In the blessed light and air, "
278,VI,Miles of green tranquillity Down the river to the sea. 
279,VI,"Here the sea-birds roam at will, And the sea-wind on the hill "
280,VI,"Brings the hollow pebbly roar From the dim and rosy shore, "
281,VI,With the very scent and draft Of the old sea's mighty craft. 
282,VI,"I am standing on the dunes, By some charm that must be June's, "
283,VI,When the magic of her hand Lays a sea-spell on the land. 
284,VI,And the old enchantment falls On the blue-gray orchard walls 
285,VI,"And the purple high-top boles, While the orange orioles "
286,VI,Flame and whistle through the green Of that paradisal scene. 
287,VI,"Strolling idly for an hour Where the elder is in flower, "
288,VI,I can hear the bob-white call Down beyond the pasture wall. 
289,VI,"Musing in the scented heat, Where the bayberry is sweet, "
290,VI,I can see the shadows run Up the cliff-side in the sun. 
291,VI,"Or I cross the bridge and reach The mossers' houses on the beach, "
292,VI,Where the bathers on the sand Lie sea-freshened and sun-tanned. 
293,VI,"Thus I pass the gates of time And the boundaries of clime, "
294,VI,Change the ugly man-made street For God's country green and sweet. 
295,VI,"Fag of body, irk of mind, In a moment left behind, "
296,VI,Once more I possess my soul With the poise and self-control 
297,VI,Beauty gives the free of heart Through the sorcery of art. 
298,VI,Threnody for a Poet 
299,VI,"Not in the ancient abbey, Nor in the city ground, Not in the lonely mountains, Nor in the blue profound, Lay him to rest when his time is come And the smiling mortal lips are dumb; "
300,VI,"But here in the decent quiet Under the whispering pines, Where the dogwood breaks in blossom And the peaceful sunlight shines, Where wild birds sing and ferns unfold, When spring comes back in her green and gold. "
301,VI,"And when that mortal likeness Has been dissolved by fire, Say not above the ashes, ""Here ends a man's desire."" For every year when the bluebirds sing, He shall be part of the lyric spring. "
302,VI,"Then dreamful-hearted lovers Shall hear in wind and rain The cadence of his music, The rhythm of his refrain, For he was a blade of the April sod That bowed and blew with the whisper of God. "
303,VI,Dust of the Street 
304,VI,"This cosmic dust beneath our feet Rising to hurry down the street, "
305,VI,"Borne by the wind and blown astray In its erratic, senseless way, "
306,VI,Is the same stuff as you and I-- With knowledge and desire put by. 
307,VI,"Thousands of times since time began It has been used for making man, "
308,VI,"Freighted like us with every sense Of spirit and intelligence, "
309,VI,To walk the world and know the fine Large consciousness of things divine. 
310,VI,"These wandering atoms in their day Perhaps have passed this very way, "
311,VI,"With eager step and flowerlike face, With lovely ardor, poise, and grace, "
312,VI,"On what delightful errands bent, Passionate, generous, and intent,-- "
313,VI,"An angel still, though veiled and gloved, Made to love us and to be loved. "
314,VI,"Friends, when the summons comes for me To turn my back (reluctantly) "
315,VI,"On this delightful play, I claim Only one thing in friendship's name; "
316,VI,"And you will not decline a task So slight, when it is all I ask: "
317,VI,Scatter my ashes in the street Where avenue and crossway meet. 
318,VI,"I beg you of your charity, No granite and cement for me, "
319,VI,To needlessly perpetuate An unimportant name and date. 
320,VI,"Others may wish to lay them down On some fair hillside far from town, "
321,VI,"Where slim white birches wave and gleam Beside a shadowy woodland stream, "
322,VI,"Or in luxurious beds of fern, But I would have my dust return "
323,VI,To the one place it loved the best In days when it was happiest. 
324,VI,To a Young Lady on Her Birthday 
325,VI,The marching years go by And brush your garment's hem. The bandits by and by Will bid you go with them. 
326,VI,"Trust not that caravan! Old vagabonds are they; They'll rob you if they can, And make believe it's play. "
327,VI,"Make the old robbers give Of all the spoils they bear,-- Their truth, to help you live,-- Their joy, to keep you fair. "
328,VI,"Ask not for gauds nor gold, Nor fame that falsely rings; The foolish world grows old Caring for all these things. "
329,VI,"Make all your sweet demands For happiness alone, And the years will fill your hands With treasures rarely known. "
330,VI,The Gift 
331,VI,"I said to Life, ""How comes it, With all this wealth in store, Of beauty, joy, and knowledge, Thy cry is still for more? "
332,VI,"""Count all the years of striving To make thy burden less,-- The things designed and fashioned To gladden thy success! "
333,VI,"""The treasures sought and gathered Thy lightest whim to please,-- The loot of all the ages, The spoil of all the seas! "
334,VI,"""Is there no end of labor, No limit to thy need? Must man go bowed forever In bondage to thy greed?"" "
335,VI,"With tears of pride and passion She answered, ""God above! I only wait the asking, To spend it all for love!"" "
336,VI,The Cry of the Hillborn 
337,VI,I am homesick for the mountains-- My heroic mother hills-- And the longing that is on me No solace ever stills. 
338,VI,"I would climb to brooding summits With their old untarnished dreams, Cool my heart in forest shadows To the lull of falling streams; "
339,VI,"Hear the innocence of aspens That babble in the breeze, And the fragrant sudden showers That patter on the trees. "
340,VI,"I am lonely for my thrushes In their hermitage withdrawn, Toning the quiet transports Of twilight and of dawn. "
341,VI,"I need the pure, strong mornings, When the soul of day is still, With the touch of frost that kindles The scarlet on the hill; "
342,VI,"Lone trails and winding woodroads To outlooks wild and high, And the pale moon waiting sundown Where ledges cut the sky. "
343,VI,"I dream of upland clearings Where cones of sumac burn, And gaunt and gray-mossed boulders Lie deep in beds of fern; "
344,VI,"The gray and mottled beeches, The birches' satin sheen, The majesty of hemlocks Crowning the blue ravine. "
345,VI,"My eyes dim for the skyline Where purple peaks aspire, And the forges of the sunset Flare up in golden fire. "
346,VI,"There crests look down unheeding And see the great winds blow, Tossing the huddled tree-tops In gorges far below; "
347,VI,"Where cloud-mists from the warm earth Roll up about their knees, And hang their filmy tatters Like prayers upon the trees. "
348,VI,"I cry for night-blue shadows On plain and hill and dome,-- The spell of old enchantments, The sorcery of home. "
349,VI,A Mountain Gateway 
350,VI,"I know a vale where I would go one day, When June comes back and all the world once more Is glad with summer.  Deep in shade it lies A mighty cleft between the bosoming hills, A cool dim gateway to the mountains' heart. "
351,VI,"On either side the wooded slopes come down, Hemlock and beech and chestnut.  Here and there Through the deep forest laurel spreads and gleams, Pink-white as Daphne in her loveliness. Among the sunlit shadows I can see That still perfection from the world withdrawn, As if the wood-gods had arrested there Immortal beauty in her breathless flight. "
352,VI,"The road winds in from the broad river-lands, Luring the happy traveller turn by turn Up to the lofty mountains of the sky. And as he marches with uplifted face, Far overhead against the arching blue Gray ledges overhang from dizzy heights, Scarred by a thousand winters and untamed. "
353,VI,"And where the road runs in the valley's foot, Through the dark woods a mountain stream comes down, Singing and dancing all its youth away Among the boulders and the shallow runs, Where sunbeams pierce and mossy tree trunks hang Drenched all day long with murmuring sound and spray. "
354,VI,"There light of heart and footfree, I would go Up to my home among the lasting hills. Nearing the day's end, I would leave the road, Turn to the left and take the steeper trail That climbs among the hemlocks, and at last In my own cabin doorway sit me down, Companioned in that leafy solitude By the wood ghosts of twilight and of peace, While evening passes to absolve the day And leave the tranquil mountains to the stars. "
355,VI,"And in that sweet seclusion I should hear, Among the cool-leafed beeches in the dusk, The calm-voiced thrushes at their twilight hymn. So undistraught, so rapturous, so pure, They well might be, in wisdom and in joy, The seraphs singing at the birth of time The unworn ritual of eternal things. "
356,VI,Morning in the Hills 
357,VI,"How quiet is the morning in the hills! The stealthy shadows of the summer clouds Trail through the ca√±on, and the mountain stream Sounds his sonorous music far below In the deep-wooded wind-enchanted cove. "
358,VI,"Hemlock and aspen, chestnut, beech, and fir Go tiering down from storm-worn crest and ledge, While in the hollows of the dark ravine See the red road emerge, then disappear Towards the wide plain and fertile valley lands. "
359,VI,"My forest cabin half-way up the glen Is solitary, save for one wise thrush, The sound of falling water, and the wind Mysteriously conversing with the leaves. "
360,VI,"Here I abide unvisited by doubt, Dreaming of far-off turmoil and despair, The race of men and love and fleeting time, What life may be, or beauty, caught and held For a brief moment at eternal poise. "
361,VI,"What impulse now shall quicken and make live This outward semblance and this inward self? One breath of being fills the bubble world, Colored and frail, with fleeting change on change. "
362,VI,"Surely some God contrived so fair a thing In a vast leisure of uncounted days, And touched it with the breath of living joy, Wondrous and fair and wise!  It must be so. "
363,VI,A Wood-path 
364,VI,"At evening and at morning By an enchanted way I walk the world in wonder, And have no word to say. "
365,VI,"It is the path we traversed One twilight, thou and I; Thy beauty all a rapture, My spirit all a cry. "
366,VI,"The red leaves fall upon it, The moon and mist and rain, But not the magic footfall That made its meaning plain. "
367,VI,Weather of the Soul 
368,VI,"There is a world of being We range from pole to pole, Through seasons of the spirit And weather of the soul. "
369,VI,"It has its new-born Aprils, With gladness in the air, Its golden Junes of rapture, Its winters of despair. "
370,VI,And in its tranquil autumns We halt to re-enforce Our tattered scarlet pennons With valor and resource. 
371,VI,"From undiscovered regions Only the angels know, Great winds of aspiration Perpetually blow, "
372,VI,"To free the sap of impulse From torpor of distrust, And into flowers of joyance Quicken the sentient dust. "
373,VI,"From nowhere of a sudden Loom sudden clouds of fault, With thunders of oppression And lightnings of revolt. "
374,VI,"With hush of apprehension And quaking of the heart, There breed the storms of anger, And floods of sorrow start. "
375,VI,"And there shall fall,--how gently!-- To make them fertile yet, The rain of absolution On acres of regret. "
376,VI,"Till snows of mercy cover The dream that shall come true, When time makes all things wondrous, And life makes all things new. "
377,VI,Here and Now 
378,VI,"Where is Heaven?  Is it not Just a friendly garden plot, Walled with stone and roofed with sun, Where the days pass one by one, Not too fast and not too slow, Looking backward as they go At the beauties left behind To transport the pensive mind! "
379,VI,"Is it not a greening ground With a river for its bound, And a wood-thrush to prolong Fragrant twilights with his song, When the peonies in June Wait the rising of the moon, And the music of the stream Voices its immortal dream! "
380,VI,"There each morning will renew The miracle of light and dew, And the soul may joy to praise The Lord of roses and of days; There the caravan of noon Halts to hear the cricket's tune, Fifing there for all who pass The anthem of the summer grass! "
381,VI,"Does not Heaven begin that day When the eager heart can say, Surely God is in this place, I have seen Him face to face In the loveliness of flowers, In the service of the showers, And His voice has talked to me In the sunlit apple tree. "
382,VI,"I can feel Him in my heart, When the tears of knowledge start For another's joy or woe, Where the lonely soul must go. Yea, I learned His very look, When we walked beside the brook, And you smiled and touched my hand. God is love...  I understand. "
383,VI,The Angel of Joy 
384,VI,There is no grief for me Nor sadness any more; For since I first knew thee Great Joy has kept my door. 
385,VI,"That angel of the calm All-comprehending smile, No menace can dismay, No falsity beguile. "
386,VI,"Out of the house of life Before him fled away Languor, regret, and strife And sorrow on that day. "
387,VI,"Grim fear, unmanly doubt, And impotent despair Went at his bidding forth Among the things that were,-- "
388,VI,"Leaving a place all clean, Resounding of the sea And decked with forest green, To be a home for thee. "
389,VI,The Homestead. 
390,VI,"Here we came when love was young. Now that love is old, Shall we leave the floor unswept And the hearth acold? "
391,VI,"Here the hill-wind in the dusk. Wandering to and fro, Moves the moonflowers, like a ghost Of the long ago. "
392,VI,"Here from every doorway looks A remembered face, Every sill and panel wears A familiar grace. "
393,VI,"Let the windows smile again To the morning light, And the door stand open wide When the moon is bright. "
394,VI,"Let the breeze of twilight blow Through the silent hall, And the dreaming rafters hear How the thrushes call. "
395,VI,"Oh, be merciful and fond To the house that gave All its best to shelter love, Built when love was brave! "
396,VI,"Here we came when love was young, Now that love is old, Never let its day be lone, Nor its heart acold! "
397,VI,"""The Starry Midnight Whispers"" "
398,VI,"The starry midnight whispers, As I muse before the fire On the ashes of ambition And the embers of desire, "
399,VI,"""Life has no other logic, And time no other creed, Than: 'I for joy will follow. Where thou for love dost lead!'"" "
400,VI,A Lyric 
401,VI,"Oh, once I could not understand The sob within the throat of spring,-- The shrilling of the frogs, nor why The birds so passionately sing. "
402,VI,"That was before your beauty came And stooped to teach my soul desire, When on these mortal lips you laid The magic and immortal fire. "
403,VI,"I wondered why the sea should seem So gray, so lonely, and so old; The sigh of level-driving snows In winter so forlornly cold. "
404,VI,I wondered what it was could give The scarlet autumn pomps their pride. And paint with colors not of earth The glory of the mountainside. 
405,VI,"I could not tell why youth should dream And worship at the evening star, And yet must go with eager feet Where danger and where splendor are. "
406,VI,"I could not guess why men at times, Beholding beauty, should go mad With joy or sorrow or despair Or some unknown delight they had. "
407,VI,"I wondered what they had received From Time's inexorable hand So full of loveliness and doom. But now, ah, now I understand! "
408,VI,"""April now in Morning Clad"" "
409,VI,"April now in morning clad Like a gleaming oread, With the south wind in her voice, Comes to bid the world rejoice. "
410,VI,"With the sunlight on her brow, Through her veil of silver showers, April o'er New England now Trails her robe of woodland flowers,-- "
411,VI,"Violet and anemone; While along the misty sea, Pipe at lip, she seems to blow Haunting airs of long ago. "
412,VI,Nike 
413,VI,"What do men give thanks for? I give thanks for one, Lovelier than morning, Dearer than the sun. "
414,VI,"Such a head the victors Must have praised and known, With that breast and bearing, Nike's very own-- "
415,VI,"As superb, untrammeled, Rhythmed and poised and free As the strong pure sea-wind Walking on the sea; "
416,VI,"Such a hand as Beauty Uses with full heart, Seeking for her freedom In new shapes of art; "
417,VI,"Soft as rain in April, Quiet as the days Of the purple asters And the autumn haze; "
418,VI,"With a soul more subtle Than the light of stars, Frailer than a moth's wing To the touch that mars; "
419,VI,"Wise with all the silence Of the waiting hills, When the gracious twilight Wakes in them and thrills; "
420,VI,With a voice more tender Than the early moon Hears among the thrushes In the woods of June; 
421,VI,Delicate as grasses When they lift and stir-- One sweet lyric woman-- I give thanks for her. 
422,VI,The Enchanted Traveller 
423,VI,"We travelled empty-handed With hearts all fear above, For we ate the bread of friendship, We drank the wine of love. "
424,VI,"Through many a wondrous autumn, Through many a magic spring, We hailed the scarlet banners, We heard the blue-bird sing. "
425,VI,"We looked on life and nature With the eager eyes of youth, And all we asked or cared for Was beauty, joy, and truth. "
426,VI,"We found no other wisdom, We learned no other way, Than the gladness of the morning, The glory of the day. "
427,VI,"So all our earthly treasure Shall go with us, my dears, Aboard the Shadow Liner, Across the sea of years. "
428,VI,Spring's Saraband 
429,VI,"Over the hills of April With soft winds hand in hand, Impassionate and dreamy-eyed, Spring leads her saraband. Her garments float and gather And swirl along the plain, Her headgear is the golden sun, Her cloak the silver rain. "
430,VI,"With color and with music, With perfumes and with pomp, By meadowland and upland, Through pasture, wood, and swamp, With promise and enchantment Leading her mystic mime, She comes to lure the world anew With joy as old as time. "
431,VI,"Quick lifts the marshy chorus To transport, trill on trill; There's not a rod of stony ground Unanswering on the hill. The brooks and little rivers Dance down their wild ravines, And children in the city squares Keep time, to tambourines. "
432,VI,"The bluebird in the orchard Is lyrical for her, The blackbird with his meadow pipe Sets all the wood astir, The hooded white spring-beauties Are curtsying in the breeze, The blue hepaticas are out Under the chestnut trees. "
433,VI,"The maple buds make glamor, Viburnum waves its bloom, The daffodils and tulips Are risen from the tomb. The lances of Narcissus Have pierced the wintry mold; The commonplace seems paradise Through veils of greening gold. "
434,VI,"O heart, hear thou the summons, Put every grief away, When all the motley masques of earth Are glad upon a day. Alack, that any mortal Should less than gladness bring Into the choral joy that sounds The saraband of spring! "
435,VI,Triumphalis 
436,VI,"Soul, art thou sad again With the old sadness? Thou shalt be glad again With a new gladness, When April sun and rain Mount to the teeming brain With the earth madness. "
437,VI,"When from the mould again, Spurning disaster, Spring shoots unfold again, Follow thou faster Out of the drear domain Of dark, defeat, and pain, Praising the Master. "
438,VI,"Hope for thy guide again, Ample and splendid; Love at thy side again, All doubting ended; (Ah, by the dragon slain, For nothing small or vain Michael contended!) "
439,VI,"Thou shalt take heart again, No more despairing; Play thy great part again, Loving and caring. Hark, how the gold refrain Runs through the iron strain, Splendidly daring! "
440,VI,"Thou shalt grow strong again, Confident, tender,-- Battle with wrong again, Be truth's defender,-- Of the immortal train, Born to attempt, attain, Never surrender! "
441,VI,"""Now the Lengthening Twilights Hold"" "
442,VI,"Now the lengthening twilights hold Tints of lavender and gold, And the marshy places ring With the pipers of the spring. "
443,VI,"Now the solitary star Lays a path on meadow streams, And I know it is not far To the open door of dreams. "
444,VI,"Lord of April, in my hour May the dogwood be in flower, And my angel through the dome Of spring twilight lead me home. "
445,VI,The Soul of April 
446,VI,"Over the wintry threshold Who comes with joy to-day, So frail, yet so enduring, To triumph o'er dismay? "
447,VI,"Ah, quick her tears are springing, And quickly they are dried, For sorrow walks before her, But gladness walks beside. "
448,VI,"She comes with gusts of laughter,-- The music as of rills; With tenderness and sweetness,-- The wisdom of the hills. "
449,VI,"Her hands are strong to comfort, Her heart is quick to heed. She knows the signs of sadness, She knows the voice of need. "
450,VI,"There is no living creature, However poor or small, But she will know its trouble, And hasten to its call. "
451,VI,"Oh, well they fare forever, By mighty dreams possessed, Whose hearts have lain a moment On that eternal breast. "
452,VI,An April Morning 
453,VI,Once more in misted April The world is growing green. Along the winding river The plumey willows lean. 
454,VI,"Beyond the sweeping meadows The looming mountains rise, Like battlements of dreamland Against the brooding skies. "
455,VI,"In every wooded valley The buds are breaking through, As though the heart of all things No languor ever knew. "
456,VI,The golden-wings and bluebirds Call to their heavenly choirs. The pines are blued and drifted With smoke of brushwood fires. 
457,VI,"And in my sister's garden Where little breezes run, The golden daffodillies Are blowing in the sun. "
458,VI,Earth Voices 
459,I,I 
460,I,"I heard the spring wind whisper Above the brushwood fire, ""The world is made forever Of transport and desire. "
461,I,"I am the breath of being, The primal urge of things; I am the whirl of star dust, I am the lift of wings. "
462,I,"""I am the splendid impulse That comes before the thought, The joy and exaltation Wherein the life is caught. "
463,I,"""Across the sleeping furrows I call the buried seed, And blade and bud and blossom Awaken at my need. "
464,I,"""Within the dying ashes I blow the sacred spark, And make the hearts of lovers To leap against the dark."" "
465,II,II 
466,II,"I heard the spring light whisper Above the dancing stream, ""The world is made forever In likeness of a dream. "
467,II,"""I am the law of planets, I am the guide of man; The evening and the morning Are fashioned to my plan. "
468,II,"""I tint the dawn with crimson, I tinge the sea with blue; My track is in the desert, My trail is in the dew. "
469,II,"""I paint the hills with color, And in my magic dome I light the star of evening To steer the traveller home. "
470,II,"""Within the house of being, I feed the lamp of truth With tales of ancient wisdom And prophecies of youth."" "
471,III,III 
472,III,"I heard the spring rain murmur Above the roadside flower, ""The world is made forever In melody and power. "
473,III,"""I keep the rhythmic measure That marks the steps of time, And all my toil is fashioned To symmetry and rhyme. "
474,III,"""I plow the untilled upland, I ripe the seeding grass, And fill the leafy forest With music as I pass. "
475,III,"""I hew the raw, rough granite To loveliness of line, And when my work is finished, Behold, it is divine! "
476,III,"""I am the master-builder In whom the ages trust. I lift the lost perfection To blossom from the dust."" "
477,IV,IV 
478,IV,"Then Earth to them made answer, As with a slow refrain Born of the blended voices Of wind and sun and rain, "
479,IV,"""This is the law of being That links the threefold chain: The life we give to beauty Returns to us again."" "
480,IV,Resurgam 
481,IV,"Lo, now comes the April pageant And the Easter of the year. Now the tulip lifts her chalice, And the hyacinth his spear; All the daffodils and jonquils With their hearts of gold are here. Child of the immortal vision, What hast thou to do with fear? "
482,IV,"When the summons wakes the impulse, And the blood beats in the vein, Let no grief thy dream encumber, No regret thy thought detain. Through the scented bloom-hung valleys, Over tillage, wood and plain, Comes the soothing south wind laden With the sweet impartial rain. "
483,IV,"All along the roofs and pavements Pass the volleying silver showers, To unfold the hearts of humans And the frail unanxious flowers. Breeding fast in sunlit places, Teeming life puts forth her powers, And the migrant wings come northward On the trail of golden hours. "
484,IV,Over intervale and upland Sounds the robin's interlude From his tree-top spire at evening Where no unbeliefs intrude. Every follower of beauty Finds in the spring solitude Sanctuary and persuasion Where the mysteries still brood. 
485,IV,"Now the bluebird in the orchard, A warm sighing at the door, And the soft haze on the hillside, Lure the houseling to explore The perennial enchanted Lovely world and all its lore; While the early tender twilight Breathes of those who come no more. "
486,IV,"By full brimming river margins Where the scents of brush fires blow, Through the faint green mist of springtime, Dreaming glad-eyed lovers go, Touched with such immortal madness Not a thing they care to know More than those who caught life's secret Countless centuries ago. "
487,IV,"In old Egypt for Osiris, Putting on the green attire, With soft hymns and choric dancing They went forth to greet the fire Of the vernal sun, whose ardor His earth children could inspire; And the ivory flutes would lead them To the slake of their desire. "
488,IV,"In remembrance of Adonis Did the Dorian maidens sing Linus songs of joy and sorrow For the coming back of spring,-- Sorrow for the wintry death Of each irrevocable thing, Joy for all the pangs of beauty The returning year could bring. "
489,IV,"Now the priests and holy women With sweet incense, chant and prayer, Keep His death and resurrection Whose new love bade all men share Immortality of kindness, Living to make life more fair. Wakened to such wealth of being, Who would not arise and dare? "
490,IV,"Seeing how each new fulfilment Issues at the call of need From infinitudes of purpose In the core of soul and seed, Who shall set the bounds of puissance Or the formulas of creed? Truth awaits the test of beauty, Good is proven in the deed. "
491,IV,"Therefore, give thy spring renascence,-- Freshened ardor, dreams and mirth,-- To make perfect and replenish All the sorry fault and dearth Of the life from whose enrichment Thine aspiring will had birth; Take thy part in the redemption Of thy kind from bonds of earth. "
492,IV,"So shalt thou, absorbed in beauty, Even in this mortal clime Share the life that is eternal, Brother to the lords of time,-- Virgil, Raphael, Gautama,-- Builders of the world sublime. Yesterday was not earth's evening Every morning is our prime. "
493,IV,"All that can be worth the rescue From oblivion and decay,-- Joy and loveliness and wisdom,-- In thyself, without dismay Thou shalt save and make enduring Through each word and act, to sway The hereafter to a likeness Of thyself in other clay. "
494,IV,"Still remains the peradventure, Soul pursues an orbit here Like those unreturning comets, Sweeping on a vast career, By an infinite directrix, Focussed to a finite sphere,-- Nurtured in an earthly April, In what realm to reappear? "
495,IV,Easter Eve 
496,IV,"If I should tell you I saw Pan lately down by the shallows of Silvermine, Blowing an air on his pipe of willow, just as the moon began to shine; Or say that, coming from town on Wednesday, I met Christ walking in Ponus Street; You might remark, ""Our friend is flighty!  Visions, for want of enough red meat!"" "
497,IV,"Then let me ask you.  Last December, when there was skating on Wampanaw, Among the weeds and sticks and grasses under the hard black ice I saw An old mud-turtle poking about, as if he were putting his house to rights, Stiff with the cold perhaps, yet knowing enough to prepare for the winter nights. "
498,IV,"And here he is on a log this morning, sunning himself as calm as you please. But I want to know, when the lock of winter was sprung of a sudden, who kept the keys? Who told old nibbler to go to sleep safe and sound with the lily roots, And then in the first warm days of April--out to the sun with the greening shoots? "
499,IV,"By night a flock of geese went over, honking north on the trails of air, The spring express--but who despatched it, equipped with speed and cunning care? Hark to our bluebird down in the orchard trolling his chant of the happy heart, As full of light as a theme of Mozart's--but where did he learn that more than art? "
500,IV,"Where the river winds through grassy meadows, as sure as the south wind brings the rain, Sounding his reedy note in the alders, the redwing comes back to his nest again. Are these not miracles?  Prompt you answer: ""Merely the prose of natural fact; Nothing but instinct plain and patent, born in the creatures, that bids them act."" "
501,IV,"Well, I have an instinct as fine and valid, surely, as that of the beasts and birds, Concerning death and the life immortal, too deep for logic, too vague for words. No trace of beauty can pass or perish, but other beauty is somewhere born; No seed of truth or good be planted, but the yield must grow as the growing corn. "
502,IV,"Therefore this ardent mind and spirit I give to the glowing days of earth. To be wrought by the Lord of life to something of lasting import and lovely worth. If the toil I give be without self-seeking, bestowed to the limit of will and power, To fashion after some form ideal the instant task and the waiting hour, "
503,IV,"It matters not though defeat undo me, though faults betray me and sorrows scar, Already I share the life eternal with the April buds and the evening star. The slim new moon is my sister now; the rain, my brother; the wind, my friend. Is it not well with these forever?  Can the soul of man fare ill in the end? "
504,IV,Now is the Time of Year 
505,IV,"Now is the time of year When all the flutes begin,-- The redwing bold and clear, The rainbird far and thin. "
506,IV,In all the waking lands There's not a wilding thing But knows and understands The burden of the spring. 
507,IV,"Now every voice alive By rocky wood and stream Is lifted to revive The ecstasy, the dream. "
508,IV,"For Nature, never old, But busy as of yore, From sun and rain and mould Is making spring once more. "
509,IV,"She sounds her magic note By river-marge and hill, And every woodland throat Re-echoes with a thrill. "
510,IV,"O mother of our days, Hearing thy music call. Teach us to know thy ways And fear no more at all! "
511,IV,The Redwing 
512,IV,"I hear you, Brother, I hear you, Down in the alder swamp, Springing your woodland whistle To herald the April pomp! "
513,IV,"First of the moving vanguard, In front of the spring you come, Where flooded waters sparkle And streams in the twilight hum. "
514,IV,"You sound the note of the chorus By meadow and woodland pond, Till, one after one up-piping, A myriad throats respond. "
515,IV,"I see you, Brother, I see you, With scarlet under your wing, Flash through the ruddy maples, Leading the pageant of spring. "
516,IV,"Earth has put off her raiment Wintry and worn and old, For the robe of a fair young sibyl. Dancing in green and gold. "
517,IV,"I heed you, Brother.  To-morrow I, too, in the great employ, Will shed my old coat of sorrow For a brand-new garment of joy. "
518,IV,The Rainbird 
519,IV,I hear a rainbird singing Far off.  How fine and clear His plaintive voice comes ringing With rapture to the ear! 
520,IV,"Over the misty wood-lots, Across the first spring heat, Comes the enchanted cadence, So clear, so solemn-sweet. "
521,IV,"How often I have hearkened To that high pealing strain Across wild cedar barrens, Under the soft gray rain! "
522,IV,"How often I have wondered, And longed in vain to know The source of that enchantment, That touch of human woe! "
523,IV,"O brother, who first taught thee To haunt the teeming spring With that sad mortal wisdom Which only age can bring? "
524,IV,Lament 
525,IV,"When you hear the white-throat pealing From a tree-top far away, And the hills are touched with purple At the borders of the day; "
526,IV,"When the redwing sounds his whistle At the coming on of spring, And the joyous April pipers Make the alder marshes ring; "
527,IV,"When the wild new breath of being Whispers to the world once more, And before the shrine of beauty Every spirit must adore; "
528,IV,"When long thoughts come back with twilight, And a tender deepened mood Shows the eyes of the beloved Like the hepaticas in the wood; "
529,IV,"Ah, remember, when to nothing Save to love your heart gives heed, And spring takes you to her bosom,-- So it was with Golden Weed! "
530,IV,Under the April Moon 
531,IV,"Oh, well the world is dreaming Under the April moon, Her soul in love with beauty, Her senses all a-swoon! "
532,IV,"Pure hangs the silver crescent Above the twilight wood, And pure the silver music Wakes from the marshy flood. "
533,IV,"O Earth, with all thy transport, How comes it life should seem A shadow in the moonlight, A murmur in a dream? "
534,IV,The Flute of Spring 
535,IV,"I know a shining meadow stream That winds beneath an Eastern hill, And all year long in sun or gloom Its murmuring voice is never still. "
536,IV,"The summer dies more gently there, The April flowers are earlier,-- The first warm rain-wind from the Sound Sets all their eager hearts astir. "
537,IV,"And there when lengthening twilights fall As softly as a wild bird's wing, Across the valley in the dusk I hear the silver flute of spring. "
538,IV,Spring Night 
539,IV,"In the wondrous star-sown night, In the first sweet warmth of spring, I lie awake and listen To hear the glad earth sing. "
540,IV,"I hear the brook in the wood Murmuring, as it goes, The song of the happy journey Only the wise heart knows. "
541,IV,"I hear the trilling note Of the tree-frog under the hill, And the clear and watery treble Of his brother, silvery shrill. "
542,IV,"And then I wander away Through the mighty forest of Sleep, To follow the fairy music To the shore of an endless deep. "
543,IV,Bloodroot 
544,IV,"When April winds arrive And the soft rains are here, Some morning by the roadside These Fairy folk appear. "
545,IV,"We never see their coming, However sharp our eyes; Each year as if by magic They take us by surprise. "
546,IV,"Along the ragged woodside And by the green spring-run, Their small white heads are nodding And twinkling in the sun. "
547,IV,"They crowd across the meadow In innocence and mirth, As if there were no sorrow In all this wondrous earth. "
548,IV,"So frail, so unregarded, And yet about them clings A sorcery of welcome,-- The joy of common things. "
549,IV,Perhaps their trail of beauty Across the pasture sod In jubilant procession Is where an angel trod. 
550,IV,Daffodil's Return 
551,IV,"What matter if the sun be lost? What matter though the sky be gray? There's joy enough about the house, For Daffodil comes home to-day. "
552,IV,"There's news of swallows on the air, There's word of April on the way, They're calling flowers within the street, And Daffodil comes home to-day. "
553,IV,"O who would care what fate may bring, Or what the years may take away! There's life enough within the hour, For Daffodil comes home to-day. "
554,IV,Now the Lilac Tree's in Bud 
555,IV,"Now the lilac tree's in bud, And the morning birds are loud. Now a stirring in the blood Moves the heart of every crowd. "
556,IV,Word has gone abroad somewhere Of a great impending change. There's a message in the air Of an import glad and strange. 
557,IV,"Not an idler in the street, But is better off to-day. Not a traveller you meet, But has something wise to say. "
558,IV,"Now there's not a road too long, Not a day that is not good, Not a mile but hears a song Lifted from the misty wood. "
559,IV,Down along the Silvermine That's the blackbird's cheerful note! You can see him flash and shine With the scarlet on his coat. 
560,IV,"Now the winds are soft with rain, And the twilight has a spell, Who from gladness could refrain Or with olden sorrows dwell? "
561,IV,White Iris 
562,IV,"White Iris was a princess In a kingdom long ago, Mysterious as moonlight And silent as the snow. "
563,IV,"She drew the world in wonder And swayed it with desire, Ere Babylon was builded Or a stone laid in Tyre. "
564,IV,"Yet here within my garden Her loveliness appears, Undimmed by any sorrow Of all the tragic years. "
565,IV,"How kind that earth should treasure So beautiful a thing-- All mystical enchantment, To stir our hearts in spring! "
566,IV,The Tree of Heaven 
567,IV,"Young foreign-born Ailanthus, Because he grew so fast, We scorned his easy daring And doubted it would last. "
568,IV,"But lo, when autumn gathers And all the woods are old, He stands in green and salmon, A glory to behold! "
569,IV,Among the ancient monarchs His airy tent is spread. His robe of coronation Is tasseled rosy red. 
570,IV,"With something strange and Eastern, His height and grace proclaim His lineage and title Is that celestial name. "
571,IV,"This is the Tree of Heaven, Which seems to say to us, ""Behold how rife is beauty, And how victorious!"" "
572,IV,Peony 
573,IV,"""_Pionia virtutem habet occultam._"" Arnoldus Villanova--1235-1313. "
574,IV,"_Arnoldus Villanova Six hundred years ago Said Peonies have magic, And I believe it so. There stands his learned dictum Which any boy may read, But he who learns the secret Will be made wise indeed._ "
575,IV,"_Astrologer and doctor In the science of his day, Have we so far outstripped him? What more is there to say? His medieval Latin Records the truth for us, Which I translate--virtutem Habet occultam--thus:_ "
576,IV,"She hath a deep-hid virtue No other flower hath. When summer comes rejoicing A-down my garden path, In opulence of color, In robe of satin sheen, She casts o'er all the hours Her sorcery serene. "
577,IV,"A subtile, heartening fragrance Comes piercing the warm hush, And from the greening woodland I hear the first wild thrush. They move my heart to pity For all the vanished years, With ecstasy of longing And tenderness of tears. "
578,IV,"By many names we call her,-- Pale exquisite Aurore, Luxuriant Gismonda Or sunny Couronne D'Or. What matter,--Grandiflora, A queen in some proud book, Or sweet familiar Piny With her old-fashioned look? "
579,IV,"The crowding Apple blossoms Above the orchard wall; The Moonflower in August When eerie nights befall; Chrysanthemum in autumn, Whose pageantries appear With mystery and silence To deck the dying year; "
580,IV,"And many a mystic flower Of the wildwood I have known, But Pionia Arnoldi Hath a transport all her own. For Peony, my Peony, Hath strength to make me whole,-- She gives her heart of beauty For the healing of my soul. "
581,IV,"_Arnoldus Villanova, Though earth is growing old, As long as life has longing Your guess at truth will hold. Still works the hidden power After a thousand springs,-- The medicine for heartache That lurks in lovely things._ "
582,IV,The Urban Pan 
583,IV,"Once more the magic days are come With stronger sun and milder air; The shops are full of daffodils; There's golden leisure everywhere. I heard my Lou this morning shout: ""Here comes the hurdy-gurdy man!"" And through the open window caught The piping of the urban Pan. "
584,IV,"I laid my wintry task aside, And took a day to follow joy: The trail of beauty and the call That lured me when I was a boy. I looked, and there looked up at me A smiling, swarthy, hairy man With kindling eye--and well I knew The piping of the urban Pan. "
585,IV,"He caught my mood; his hat was off; I tossed the ungrudged silver down. The cunning vagrant, every year He casts his spell upon the town! And we must fling him, old and young, Our dimes or coppers, as we can; And every heart must leap to hear The piping of the urban Pan. "
586,IV,"The music swells and fades again, And I in dreams am far away, Where a bright river sparkles down To meet a blue Aegean bay. There, in the springtime of the world, Are dancing fauns, and in their van, Is one who pipes a deathless tune-- The earth-born and the urban Pan. "
587,IV,"And so he follows down the block, A troop of children in his train, The light-foot dancers of the street Enamored of the reedy strain. I hear their laughter rise and ring Above the noise of truck and van, As down the mellow wind fades out The piping of the urban Pan. "
588,IV,The Sailing of the Fleets 
589,IV,"Now the spring is in the town, Now the wind is in the tree, And the wintered keels go down To the calling of the sea. "
590,IV,"Out from mooring, dock, and slip, Through the harbor buoys they glide, Drawing seaward till they dip To the swirling of the tide. "
591,IV,"One by one and two by two, Down the channel turns they go, Steering for the open blue Where the salty great airs blow; "
592,IV,"Craft of many a build and trim, Every stitch of sail unfurled, Till they hang upon the rim Of the azure ocean world. "
593,IV,"Who has ever, man or boy, Seen the sea all flecked with gold, And not longed to go with joy Forth upon adventures bold? "
594,IV,"Who could bear to stay indoor, Now the wind is in the street, For the creaking of the oar And the tugging of the sheet! "
595,IV,"Now the spring is in the town, Who would not a rover be, When the wintered keels go down To the calling of the sea? "
596,IV,'Tis May now in New England 
597,IV,"'Tis May now in New England And through the open door I see the creamy breakers, I hear the hollow roar. "
598,IV,"Back to the golden marshes Comes summer at full tide, But not the golden comrade Who was the summer's pride. "
599,IV,In Early May 
600,IV,"O my dear, the world to-day Is more lovely than a dream! Magic hints from far away Haunt the woodland, and the stream Murmurs in his rocky bed Things that never can be said. "
601,IV,"Starry dogwood is in flower, Gleaming through the mystic woods. It is beauty's perfect hour In the wild spring solitudes. Now the orchards in full blow Shed their petals white as snow. "
602,IV,"All the air is honey-sweet With the lilacs white and red, Where the blossoming branches meet In an arbor overhead. And the laden cherry trees Murmur with the hum of bees. "
603,IV,"All the earth is fairy green, And the sunlight filmy gold, Full of ecstasies unseen, Full of mysteries untold. Who would not be out-of-door, Now the spring is here once more! "
604,IV,Fireflies 
605,IV,The fireflies across the dusk Are flashing signals through the gloom-- Courageous messengers of light That dare immensities of doom. 
606,IV,"About the seeding meadow-grass, Like busy watchmen in the street, They come and go, they turn and pass, Lighting the way for Beauty's feet. "
607,IV,"Or up they float on viewless wings To twinkle high among the trees, And rival with soft glimmerings The shining of the Pleiades. "
608,IV,"The stars that wheel above the hill Are not more wonderful to see, Nor the great tasks that they fulfill More needed in eternity. "
609,IV,The Path to Sankoty 
610,IV,It winds along the headlands Above the open sea-- The lonely moorland footpath That leads to Sankoty. 
611,IV,"The crooning sea spreads sailless And gray to the world's rim, Where hang the reeking fog-banks Primordial and dim. "
612,IV,"There fret the ceaseless currents, And the eternal tide Chafes over hidden shallows Where the white horses ride. "
613,IV,"The wistful fragrant moorlands Whose smile bids panic cease, Lie treeless and cloud-shadowed In grave and lonely peace. "
614,IV,"Across their flowering bosom, From the far end of day Blow clean the great soft moor-winds All sweet with rose and bay. "
615,IV,"A world as large and simple As first emerged for man, Cleared for the human drama, Before the play began. "
616,IV,"O well the soul must treasure The calm that sets it free-- The vast and tender skyline, The sea-turn's wizardry, "
617,IV,"Solace of swaying grasses, The friendship of sweet-fern-- And in the world's confusion Remembering, must yearn "
618,IV,"To tread the moorland footpath That leads to Sankoty, Hearing the field-larks shrilling Beside the sailless sea. "
619,IV,Off Monomoy 
620,IV,"Have you sailed Nantucket Sound By lightship, buoy, and bell, And lain becalmed at noon On an oily summer swell? "
621,IV,"Lazily drooped the sail, Moveless the pennant hung, Sagging over the rail Idle the main boom swung; "
622,IV,"The sea, one mirror of shine A single breath would destroy, Save for the far low line Of treacherous Monomoy. "
623,IV,"Yet eastward there toward Spain, What castled cities rise From the Atlantic plain, To our enchanted eyes! "
624,IV,"Turret and spire and roof Looming out of the sea, Where the prosy chart gives proof No cape nor isle can be! "
625,IV,Can a vision shine so clear Wherein no substance dwells? One almost harks to hear The sound of the city's bells. 
626,IV,"And yet no pealing notes Within those belfries be, Save echoes from the throats Of ship-bells lost at sea. "
627,IV,"For none shall anchor there Save those who long of yore, When tide and wind were fair, Sailed and came back no more. "
628,IV,"And none shall climb the stairs Within those ghostly towers, Save those for whom sad prayers Went up through fateful hours. "
629,IV,"O image of the world, O mirage of the sea, Cloud-built and foam-impearled. What sorcery fashioned thee? "
630,IV,"What architect of dream, What painter of desire, Conceived that fairy scheme Touched with fantastic fire? "
631,IV,Even so our city of hope We mortal dreamers rear Upon the perilous slope Above the deep of fear; 
632,IV,"Leaving half-known the good Our kindly earth bestows, For the feigned beatitude Of a future no man knows. "
633,IV,"Lord of the summer sea, Whose tides are in thy hand, Into immensity The vision at thy command "
634,IV,"Fades now, and leaves no sign,-- No light nor bell nor buoy,-- Only the faint low line Of dangerous Monomoy. "
635,IV,In St. Germain Street 
636,IV,"Through the street of St. Germain March the tattered hosts of rain, "
637,IV,While the wind with vagrant fife Whips their chilly ranks to life. 
638,IV,"From the window I can see Their ghostly banners blowing free, "
639,IV,As they pass to where the ships Crowd about the wharves and slips. 
640,IV,"There at day's end they embark To invade the realms of dark, "
641,IV,And the sun comes out again In the street of St. Germain. 
642,IV,Pan in the Catskills 
643,IV,"They say that he is dead, and now no more The reedy syrinx sounds among the hills, When the long summer heat is on the land. But I have heard the Catskill thrushes sing, And therefore am incredulous of death, Of pain and sorrow and mortality. "
644,IV,"In these blue ca√±ons, deep with hemlock shade, In solitudes of twilight or of dawn, I have been rapt away from time and care By the enchantment of a golden strain As pure as ever pierced the Thracian wild, Filling the listener with a mute surmise. "
645,IV,"At evening and at morning I have gone Down the cool trail between the beech-tree boles, And heard the haunting music of the wood Ring through the silence of the dark ravine, Flooding the earth with beauty and with joy And all the ardors of creation old. "
646,IV,"And then within my pagan heart awoke Remembrance of far-off and fabled years In the untarnished sunrise of the world, When clear-eyed Hellas in her rapture heard A slow mysterious piping wild and keen Thrill through her vales, and whispered, ""It is Pan!"" "
647,IV,A New England June 
648,IV,"_These things I remember Of New England June, Like a vivid day-dream In the azure noon, While one haunting figure Strays through every scene, Like the soul of beauty Through her lost demesne._ "
649,IV,"Gardens full of roses And peonies a-blow In the dewy morning, Row on stately row, Spreading their gay patterns, Crimson, pied and cream, Like some gorgeous fresco Or an Eastern dream. "
650,IV,"Nets of waving sunlight Falling through the trees; Fields of gold-white daisies Rippling in the breeze; Lazy lifting groundswells, Breaking green as jade On the lilac beaches, Where the shore-birds wade. "
651,IV,"Orchards full of blossom, Where the bob-white calls And the honeysuckle Climbs the old gray walls; Groves of silver birches, Beds of roadside fern, In the stone-fenced pasture At the river's turn. "
652,IV,"_Out of every picture Still she comes to me With the morning freshness Of the summer sea,-- A glory in her bearing, A sea-light in her eyes, As if she could not forget The spell of Paradise._ "
653,IV,"Thrushes in the deep woods, With their golden themes, Fluting like the choirs At the birth of dreams. Fireflies in the meadows At the gate of Night, With their fairy lanterns Twinkling soft and bright. "
654,IV,"Ah, not in the roses, Nor the azure noon, Nor the thrushes' music, Lies the soul of June. It is something finer, More unfading far, Than the primrose evening And the silver star; "
655,IV,"Something of the rapture My beloved had, When she made the morning Radiant and glad,-- Something of her gracious Ecstasy of mien, That still haunts the twilight, Loving though unseen. "
656,IV,"_When the ghostly moonlight Walks my garden ground, Like a leisurely patrol On his nightly round, These things I remember Of the long ago, While the slumbrous roses Neither care nor know._ "
657,IV,The Tent of Noon 
658,IV,"Behold, now, where the pageant of high June Halts in the glowing noon! The trailing shadows rest on plain and hill; The bannered hosts are still, While over forest crown and mountain head The azure tent is spread. "
659,IV,The song is hushed in every woodland throat; Moveless the lilies float; Even the ancient ever-murmuring sea Sighs only fitfully; The cattle drowse in the field-corner's shade; Peace on the world is laid. 
660,IV,"It is the hour when Nature's caravan, That bears the pilgrim Man Across the desert of uncharted time To his far hope sublime, Rests in the green oasis of the year, As if the end drew near. "
661,IV,"Ah, traveller, hast thou naught of thanks or praise For these fleet halcyon days?-- No courage to uplift thee from despair Born with the breath of prayer? Then turn thee to the lilied field once more! God stands in his tent door. "
662,IV,Children of Dream 
663,IV,"The black ash grows in the swampy ground, The white ash in the dry; The thrush he holds to the woodland bound, The hawk to the open sky. "
664,IV,"The trout he runs to the mountain brook, The swordfish keeps the sea; The brown bear knows where the blueberry grows. The clover calls the bee. "
665,IV,"The locust sings in the August noon, The frog in the April night; The iris loves the meadow-land, The laurel loves the height. "
666,IV,"And each will hold his tenure old Of earth and sun and stream, For all are creatures of desire And children of a dream. "
667,IV,Roadside Flowers 
668,IV,"We are the roadside flowers, Straying from garden grounds,-- Lovers of idle hours, Breakers of ordered bounds. "
669,IV,"If only the earth will feed us, If only the wind be kind, We blossom for those who need us, The stragglers left behind. "
670,IV,"And lo, the Lord of the Garden, He makes his sun to rise, And his rain to fall with pardon On our dusty paradise. "
671,IV,"On us he has laid the duty,-- The task of the wandering breed,-- To better the world with beauty, Wherever the way may lead. "
672,IV,"Who shall inquire of the season, Or question the wind where it blows? We blossom and ask no reason. The Lord of the Garden knows. "
673,IV,The Garden of Saint Rose 
674,IV,"This is a holy refuge, The garden of Saint Rose, A fragrant altar to that peace The world no longer knows. "
675,IV,"Below a solemn hillside, Within the folding shade Of overhanging beech and pine Its walls and walks are laid. "
676,IV,"Cool through the heat of summer, Still as a sacred grove, It has the rapt unworldly air Of mystery and love. "
677,IV,"All day before its outlook The mist-blue mountains loom, And in its trees at tranquil dusk The early stars will bloom. "
678,IV,"Down its enchanted borders Glad ranks of color stand, Like hosts of silent seraphim Awaiting love's command. "
679,IV,"Lovely in adoration They wait in patient line, Snow-white and purple and deep gold About the rose-gold shrine. "
680,IV,"And there they guard the silence, While still from her recess Through sun and shade Saint Rose looks down In mellow loveliness. "
681,IV,"She seems to say, ""O stranger, Behold how loving care That gives its life for beauty's sake, Makes everything more fair! "
682,IV,"""Then praise the Lord of gardens For tree and flower and vine, And bless all gardeners who have wrought A resting place like mine!"" "
683,IV,The World Voice 
684,IV,I heard the summer sea Murmuring to the shore Some endless story of a wrong The whole world must deplore. 
685,IV,"I heard the mountain wind Conversing with the trees Of an old sorrow of the hills, Mysterious as the sea's. "
686,IV,And all that haunted day It seemed that I could hear The echo of an ancient speech Ring in my listening ear. 
687,IV,"And then it came to me, That all that I had heard Was my own heart in the sea's voice And the wind's lonely word. "
688,IV,Songs of the Grass 
689,I,I 
690,ON THE DUNES.,ON THE DUNES. 
691,ON THE DUNES.,"Here all night on the dunes In the rocking wind we sleep, Watched by sentry stars, Lulled by the drone of the deep. "
692,ON THE DUNES.,"Till hark, in the chill of the dawn A field lark wakes and cries, And over the floor of the sea We watch the round sun rise. "
693,ON THE DUNES.,"The world is washed once more In a tide of purple and gold, And the heart of the land is filled With desires and dreams untold. "
694,II,II 
695,LORD OF MORNING.,LORD OF MORNING. 
696,LORD OF MORNING.,"Lord of morning, light of day, Sacred color-kindling sun, We salute thee in the way,-- Pilgrims robed in rose and dun. "
697,LORD OF MORNING.,"For thou art a pilgrim too, Overlord of all our band. In thy fervor we renew Quests we do not understand. "
698,LORD OF MORNING.,"At thy summons we arise, At thy touch put glory on. And with glad unanxious eyes Take the journey thou hast gone. "
699,III,III 
700,THE TRAVELLER.,THE TRAVELLER. 
701,THE TRAVELLER.,"Before the night-blue fades And the stars are quite gone, I lift my head At the noiseless tread Of the angel of dawn. "
702,THE TRAVELLER.,"I hear no word, yet my heart Is beating apace; Then in glory all still On the eastern hill I behold his face. "
703,THE TRAVELLER.,"All day through the world he goes, Making glad, setting free; Then his day's work done, On the galleon sun He sinks in the sea. "
704,THE TRAVELLER.,The Choristers 
705,THE TRAVELLER.,"When earth was finished and fashioned well, There was never a musical note to tell How glad God was, save the voice of the rain And the sea and the wind on the lonely plain And the rivers among the hills. And so God made the marvellous birds For a choir of joy transcending words, That the world might hear and comprehend How rhythm and harmony can mend The spirits' hurts and ills. "
706,THE TRAVELLER.,"He filled their tiny bodies with fire, He taught them love for their chief desire, And gave them the magic of wings to be His celebrants over land and sea, Wherever man might dwell. And to each he apportioned a fragment of song-- Those broken melodies that belong To the seraphs' chorus, that we might learn The healing of gladness and discern In beauty how all is well. "
707,THE TRAVELLER.,"So music dwells in the glorious throats Forever, and the enchanted notes Fall with rapture upon our ears, Moving our hearts to joy and tears For things we cannot say. In the wilds the whitethroat sings in the rain His pure, serene, half-wistful strain; And when twilight falls the sleeping hills Ring with the cry of the whippoorwills In the blue dusk far away. "
708,THE TRAVELLER.,"In the great white heart of the winter storm The chickadee sings, for his heart is warm, And his note is brave to rally the soul From doubt and panic to self-control And elation that knows no fear. The bluebird comes with the winds of March, Like a shred of sky on the naked larch; The redwing follows the April rain To whistle contentment back again With his sturdy call of cheer. "
709,THE TRAVELLER.,"The orioles revel through orchard boughs In their coats of gold for spring's carouse; In shadowy pastures the bobwhites call, And the flute of the thrush has a melting fall Under the evening star. On the verge of June when peonies blow And joy comes back to the world we know, The bobolinks fill the fields of light With a tangle of music silver-bright To tell how glad they are. "
710,THE TRAVELLER.,"The tiny warblers fill summer trees With their exquisite lesser litanies; The tanager in his scarlet coat In the hemlock pours from a vibrant throat His canticle of the sun. The loon on the lake, the hawk in the sky, And the sea-gull--each has a piercing cry, Like outposts set in the lonely vast To cry ""all's well"" as Time goes past And another hour is gone. "
711,THE TRAVELLER.,"But of all the music in God's plan Of a mystical symphony for man, I shall remember best of all-- Whatever hereafter may befall Or pass and cease to be-- The hermit's hymn in the solitudes Of twilight through the mountain woods, And the field-larks crying about our doors On the soft sweet wind across the moors At morning by the sea. "
712,THE TRAVELLER.,The Weed's Counsel 
713,THE TRAVELLER.,"_Said a traveller by the way Pausing, ""What hast thou to say, Flower by the dusty road, That would ease a mortal's load?""_ "
714,THE TRAVELLER.,"Traveller, hearken unto me! I will tell thee how to see Beauties in the earth and sky Hidden from the careless eye. I will tell thee how to hear Nature's music wild and clear,-- Songs of midday and of dark Such as many never mark, Lyrics of creation sung Ever since the world was young. "
715,THE TRAVELLER.,And thereafter thou shalt know Neither weariness nor woe. 
716,THE TRAVELLER.,"Thou shalt see the dawn unfold Artistries of rose and gold, And the sunbeams on the sea Dancing with the wind for glee. The red lilies of the moors Shall be torches on the floors, Where the field-lark lifts his cry To rejoice the passer-by, In a wide world rimmed with blue Lovely as when time was new. "
717,THE TRAVELLER.,And thereafter thou shalt fare Light of foot and free from care. 
718,THE TRAVELLER.,"I will teach thee how to find Lost enchantments of the mind All about thee, never guessed By indifferent unrest. Thy distracted thought shall learn Patience from the roadside fern, And a sweet philosophy From the flowering locust tree,-- While thy heart shall not disdain The consolation of the rain. "
719,THE TRAVELLER.,Not an acre but shall give Of its strength to help thee live. 
720,THE TRAVELLER.,"With the many-wintered sun Shall thy hardy course be run. And the bright new moon shall be A lamp to thy felicity. When green-mantled spring shall come Past thy door with flute and drum, And when over wood and swamp Autumn trails her scarlet pomp, No misgiving shalt thou know, Passing glad to rise and go. "
721,THE TRAVELLER.,So thy days shall be unrolled Like a wondrous cloth of gold. 
722,THE TRAVELLER.,"When gray twilight with her star Makes a heaven that is not far, Touched with shadows and with dreams, Thou shalt hear the woodland streams Singing through the starry night Holy anthems of delight. So the ecstasy of earth Shall refresh thee as at birth, And thou shalt arise each morn Radiant with a soul reborn. "
723,THE TRAVELLER.,And this wisdom of a day None shall ever take away. 
724,THE TRAVELLER.,"What the secret, what the clew The wayfarer must pursue? Only one thing he must have Who would share these transports brave. Love within his heart must dwell Like a bubbling roadside well, For a spring to quicken thought, Else my counsel comes to naught. For without that quickening trust We are less than roadside dust. "
725,THE TRAVELLER.,"This, O traveller, is my creed,-- All the wisdom of the weed! "
726,THE TRAVELLER.,"_Then the traveller set his pack Once more on his dusty back, And trudged on for many a mile Fronting fortune with a smile._ "
727,THE TRAVELLER.,The Blue Heron 
728,THE TRAVELLER.,"I see the great blue heron Rising among the reeds And floating down the wind, Like a gliding sail With the set of the stream. "
729,THE TRAVELLER.,"I hear the two-horse mower Clacking among the hay, In the heat of a July noon, And the driver's voice As he turns his team. "
730,THE TRAVELLER.,"I see the meadow lilies Flecked with their darker tan, The elms, and the great white clouds; And all the world Is a passing dream. "
731,THE TRAVELLER.,Woodland Rain 
732,THE TRAVELLER.,"Shining, shining children Of the summer rain, Racing down the valley, Sweeping o'er the plain! "
733,THE TRAVELLER.,"Rushing through the forest, Pelting on the leaves, Drenching down the meadow With its standing sheaves; "
734,THE TRAVELLER.,"Robed in royal silver, Girt with jewels gay, With a gust of gladness You pass upon your way. "
735,THE TRAVELLER.,"Fresh, ah, fresh behind you, Sunlit and impearled, As it was in Eden, Lies the lovely world! "
736,THE TRAVELLER.,Summer Storm 
737,THE TRAVELLER.,"The hilltop trees are bowing Under the coming of storm. The low, gray clouds are trailing Like squadrons that sweep and form, With their ammunition of rain. "
738,THE TRAVELLER.,Then the trumpeter wind gives signal To unlimber the viewless guns; The cattle huddle together; Indoors the farmer runs; And the first shot lashes the pane. 
739,THE TRAVELLER.,"They charge through the quiet orchard; One pear tree is snapped like a wand; As they sweep from the shattered hillside, Ruffling the blackened pond, Ere the sun takes the field again. "
740,THE TRAVELLER.,Dance of the Sunbeams 
741,THE TRAVELLER.,"When morning is high o'er the hilltops, On river and stream and lake, Wherever a young breeze whispers, The sun-clad dancers wake. "
742,THE TRAVELLER.,"One after one up-springing, They flash from their dim retreat. Merry as running laughter Is the news of their twinkling feet. "
743,THE TRAVELLER.,"Over the floors of azure Wherever the wind-flaws run, Sparkling, leaping, and racing, Their antics scatter the sun. "
744,THE TRAVELLER.,"As long as water ripples And weather is clear and glad, Day after day they are dancing, Never a moment sad. "
745,THE TRAVELLER.,"But when through the field of heaven The wings of storm take flight, At a touch of the flying shadows They falter and slip from sight. "
746,THE TRAVELLER.,"Until at the gray day's ending, As the squadrons of cloud retire, They pass in the triumph of sunset With banners of crimson fire. "
747,THE TRAVELLER.,The Campfire of the Sun 
748,THE TRAVELLER.,"Lo, now, the journeying sun, Another day's march done, Kindles his campfire at the edge of night! And in the twilight pale Above his crimson trail, The stars move out their cordons still and bright. "
749,THE TRAVELLER.,"Now in the darkening hush A solitary thrush Sings on in silvery rapture to the deep; While brooding on her best, The wandering soul has rest, And earth receives her sacred gift of sleep. "
750,THE TRAVELLER.,Summer Streams 
751,THE TRAVELLER.,"All day long beneath the sun Shining through the fields they run, "
752,THE TRAVELLER.,Singing in a cadence known To the seraphs round the throne. 
753,THE TRAVELLER.,"And the traveller drawing near Through the meadow, halts to hear "
754,THE TRAVELLER.,Anthems of a natural joy No disaster can destroy. 
755,THE TRAVELLER.,"All night long from set of sun Through the starry woods they run, "
756,THE TRAVELLER.,Singing through the purple dark Songs to make a traveller hark. 
757,THE TRAVELLER.,"All night long, when winds are low, Underneath my window go "
758,THE TRAVELLER.,"The immortal happy streams, Making music through my dreams. "
759,THE TRAVELLER.,The God of the Wood 
760,THE TRAVELLER.,"Here all the forces of the wood As one converge, To make the soul of solitude Where all things merge. "
761,THE TRAVELLER.,"The sun, the rain-wind, and the rain, The visiting moon, The hurrying cloud by peak and plain, Each with its boon. "
762,THE TRAVELLER.,"Here power attains perfection still In mighty ease, That the great earth may have her will Of joy and peace. "
763,THE TRAVELLER.,"And so through me, the mortal born Of plasmic clay, Immortal powers, kind, fierce, forlorn, And glad, have sway. "
764,THE TRAVELLER.,"Eternal passions, ardors fine, And monstrous fears, Rule and rebel, serene, malign, Or loosed in tears; "
765,THE TRAVELLER.,"Until at last they shall evolve From griefs and joys Some steady light, some firm resolve, Some Godlike poise. "
766,THE TRAVELLER.,At Sunrise 
767,THE TRAVELLER.,"Now the stars have faded In the purple chill, Lo, the sun is kindling On the eastern hill. "
768,THE TRAVELLER.,"Tree by tree the forest Takes the golden tinge, As the shafts of glory Pierce the summit's fringe. "
769,THE TRAVELLER.,"Rock by rock the ledges Take the rosy sheen, As the tide of splendor Floods the dark ravine. "
770,THE TRAVELLER.,"Like a shining angel At my cabin door, Shod with hope and silence, Day is come once more. "
771,THE TRAVELLER.,"Then, as if in sorrow That you are not here, All his magic beauties Gray and disappear. "
772,THE TRAVELLER.,At Twilight 
773,THE TRAVELLER.,"Now the fire is lighted On the chimney stone, Day goes down the valley, I am left alone. "
774,THE TRAVELLER.,"Now the misty purple Floods the darkened vale, And the stars come out On the twilight trail. "
775,THE TRAVELLER.,"The mountain river murmurs In his rocky bed, And the stealthy shadows Fill the house with dread. "
776,THE TRAVELLER.,"Then I hear your laughter At the open door,-- Brightly burns the fire, I need fear no more. "
777,THE TRAVELLER.,Moonrise 
778,THE TRAVELLER.,"At the end of the road through the wood I see the great moon rise. The fields are flooded with shine, And my soul with surmise. "
779,THE TRAVELLER.,"What if that mystic orb With her shadowy beams, Should be the revealer at last Of my darkest dreams! "
780,THE TRAVELLER.,What if this tender fire In my heart's deep hold Should be wiser than all the lore Of the sages of old! 
781,THE TRAVELLER.,The Queen of Night 
782,THE TRAVELLER.,"Mortal, mortal, have you seen In the scented summer night, Great Astarte, clad in green With a veil of mystic light, Passing on her silent way, Pale and lovelier than day? "
783,THE TRAVELLER.,"Mortal, mortal, have you heard, On an odorous summer eve, Rumors of an unknown word Bidding sorrow not to grieve,-- Echoes of a silver voice Bidding every heart rejoice? "
784,THE TRAVELLER.,"Mortal, when the slim new moon Hangs above the western hill, When the year comes round to June And the leafy world is still, Then, enraptured, you shall hear Secrets for a poet's ear. "
785,THE TRAVELLER.,"Mortal, mortal, come with me, When the moon is rising large, Through the wood or from the sea, Or by some lone river marge. There, entranced, you shall behold Beauty's self, that grows not old. "
786,THE TRAVELLER.,Night Lyric 
787,THE TRAVELLER.,"In the world's far edges Faint and blue, Where the rocky ledges Stand in view, "
788,THE TRAVELLER.,"Fades the rosy, tender Evening light; Then in starry splendor Comes the night. "
789,THE TRAVELLER.,"So a stormy lifetime Comes to close, Spirit's mortal strifetime Finds repose. "
790,THE TRAVELLER.,"Faith and toil and vision Crowned at last, Failure and derision Overpast,-- "
791,THE TRAVELLER.,"All the daylight splendor Far above, Calm and sure and tender Comes thy love. "
792,THE TRAVELLER.,The Heart of Night 
793,THE TRAVELLER.,"When all the stars are sown Across the night-blue space, With the immense unknown, In silence face to face. "
794,THE TRAVELLER.,"We stand in speechless awe While Beauty marches by, And wonder at the Law Which wears such majesty. "
795,THE TRAVELLER.,"How small a thing is man In all that world-sown vast, That he should hope or plan Or dream his dream could last! "
796,THE TRAVELLER.,"O doubter of the light, Confused by fear and wrong, Lean on the heart of night And let love make thee strong! "
797,THE TRAVELLER.,"The Good that is the True Is clothed with Beauty still. Lo, in their tent of blue, The stars above the hill! "
798,THE TRAVELLER.,Peace 
799,THE TRAVELLER.,"The sleeping tarn is dark Below the wooded hill. Save for its homing sounds, The twilit world grows still. "
800,THE TRAVELLER.,"And I am left to muse In grave-eyed mystery, And watch the stars come out As sandalled dusk goes by. "
801,THE TRAVELLER.,"And now the light is gone, The drowsy murmurs cease, And through the still unknown I wonder whence comes peace. "
802,THE TRAVELLER.,"Then softly falls the word Of one beyond a name, ""Peace only comes to him Who guards his life from shame,-- "
803,THE TRAVELLER.,"""Who gives his heart to love, And holding truth for guide, Girds him with fearless strength, That freedom may abide."" "
804,THE TRAVELLER.,The Old Gray Wall 
805,THE TRAVELLER.,"Time out of mind I have stood Fronting the frost and the sun, That the dream of the world might endure, And the goodly will be done. "
806,THE TRAVELLER.,"Did the hand of the builder guess, As he laid me stone by stone, A heart in the granite lurked, Patient and fond as his own? "
807,THE TRAVELLER.,"Lovers have leaned on me Under the summer moon, And mowers laughed in my shade In the harvest heat at noon. "
808,THE TRAVELLER.,"Children roving the fields With early flowers in spring, Old men turning to look, When they heard a bluebird sing, "
809,THE TRAVELLER.,"Have seen me a thousand times Standing here in the sun, Yet never a moment dreamed Whose likeness they gazed upon. "
810,THE TRAVELLER.,"Ah, when will ye understand, Mortals who strive and plod,-- Who rests on this old gray wall Lays a hand on the shoulder of God! "
811,THE TRAVELLER.,Te Deum 
812,THE TRAVELLER.,"If I could paint you the autumn color, the melting glow upon all things laid, The violet haze of Indian summer, before its splendor begins to fade, When scarlet has reached its breathless moment, and gold the hush of its glory now, That were a mightier craft than Titian's, the heart to lift and the head to bow. "
813,THE TRAVELLER.,"I should be lord of a world of rapture, master of magic and gladness, too,-- The touch of wonder transcending science, the solace escaping from line and hue; I would reveal through tint and texture the very soul of this earth of ours, Forever yearning through boundless beauty to exalt the spirit with all her powers. "
814,THE TRAVELLER.,"See where it lies by the lake this morning, our autumn hillside of hardwood trees, A masterpiece of the mighty painter who works in the primal mysteries. A living tapestry, rich and glowing with blended marvels, vermilion and dun, Hung out for the pageant of time that passes along an avenue of the sun! "
815,THE TRAVELLER.,"The crown of the ash is tinged with purple, the hickory leaves are Etruscan gold, And the tulip-tree lifts yellow banners against the blue for a signal bold; The oaks in crimson cohorts stand, a myriad sumach torches mass In festal pomp and victorious pride, when the vision of spring is brought to pass. "
816,THE TRAVELLER.,"Down from the line of the shore's deep shadows another and softer picture lies, As if the soul of the lake in slumber should harbor a dream of paradise,-- Passive and blurred and unsubstantial, lulling the sense and luring the mind With the spell of an empty fairy world, where sinew and sap are left behind. "
817,THE TRAVELLER.,"So men dream of a far-off heaven of power and knowledge and endless joy, Asleep to the moment's fine elation, dull to the day's divine employ, Musing over a phantom image, born of fantastic hope and fear, Of the very happiness life engenders and earth provides--our privilege here. "
818,THE TRAVELLER.,"Dare we dispel a single transport, neglect the worth that is here and now, Yet dream of enjoying its shadowy semblance in the by-and-by somewhere, somehow? I heard the wind on the hillside whisper, ""They ill prepare for a journey hence Who waste the senses and starve the spirit in a world all made for spirit and sense. "
819,THE TRAVELLER.,"""Is the full stream fed from a stifled source, or the ripe fruit filled from a blighted flower? Are not the brook and the blossom greatened through many a busy beatified hour? Not in the shadow but in the substance, plastic and potent at our command, Are all the wisdom and gladness of heart; this is the kingdom of heaven at hand."" "
820,THE TRAVELLER.,"So I will pass through the lovely world, and partake of beauty to feed my soul. With earth my domain and growth my portion, how should I sue for a further dole? In the lift I feel of immortal rapture, in the flying glimpse I gain of truth, Released is the passion that sought perfection, assuaged the ardor of dreamful youth. "
821,THE TRAVELLER.,"The patience of time shall teach me courage, the strength of the sun shall lend me poise. I would give thanks for the autumn glory, for the teaching of earth and all her joys. Her fine fruition shall well suffice me; the air shall stir in my veins like wine; While the moment waits and the wonder deepens, my life shall merge with the life divine. "
822,THE TRAVELLER.,In October 
823,THE TRAVELLER.,"Now come the rosy dogwoods, The golden tulip-tree, And the scarlet yellow maple, To make a day for me. "
824,THE TRAVELLER.,"The ash-trees on the ridges, The alders in the swamp, Put on their red and purple To join the autumn pomp. "
825,THE TRAVELLER.,"The woodbine hangs her crimson Along the pasture wall, And all the bannered sumacs Have heard the frosty call. "
826,THE TRAVELLER.,"Who then so dead to valor As not to raise a cheer, When all the woods are marching In triumph of the year? "
827,THE TRAVELLER.,By Still Waters 
828,THE TRAVELLER.,"""_He leadeth me beside the still waters; He restoreth my soul._"" "
829,THE TRAVELLER.,"""My tent stands in a garden Of aster and goldenrod, Tilled by the rain and the sunshine, And sown by the hand of God,-- An old New England pasture Abandoned to peace and time, And by the magic of beauty Reclaimed to the sublime. "
830,THE TRAVELLER.,"About it are golden woodlands Of tulip and hickory; On the open ridge behind it You may mount to a glimpse of sea,-- The far-off, blue, Homeric Rim of the world's great shield, A border of boundless glamor For the soul's familiar field. "
831,THE TRAVELLER.,In purple and gray-wrought lichen The boulders lie in the sun; Along its grassy footpath The white-tailed rabbits run. The crickets work and chirrup Through the still afternoon; And the owl calls from the hillside Under the frosty moon. 
832,THE TRAVELLER.,"The odorous wild grape clambers Over the tumbling wall, And through the autumnal quiet The chestnuts open and fall. Sharing time's freshness and fragrance, Part of the earth's great soul, Here man's spirit may ripen To wisdom serene and whole. "
833,THE TRAVELLER.,"Shall we not grow with the asters-- Never reluctant nor sad, Not counting the cost of being, Living to dare and be glad? Shall we not lift with the crickets A chorus of ready cheer, Braving the frost of oblivion, Quick to be happy here? "
834,THE TRAVELLER.,"Is my will as sweet as the wild grape, Spreading delight on the air For the passer-by's enchantment, Subtle and unaware? Have I as brave a spirit, Sprung from the self-same mould, As this weed from its own contentment Lifting its shaft of gold? "
835,THE TRAVELLER.,"The deep red cones of the sumach And the woodbine's crimson's sprays Have bannered the common roadside For the pageant of passing days. These are the oracles Nature Fills with her holy breath, Giving them glory of color, Transcending the shadow of death. "
836,THE TRAVELLER.,"Here in the sifted sunlight A spirit seems to brood On the beauty and worth of being, In tranquil, instinctive mood; And the heart, filled full of gladness Such as the wise earth knows, Wells with a full thanksgiving For the gifts that life bestows: "
837,THE TRAVELLER.,"For the ancient and virile nurture Of the teeming primordial ground, For the splendid gospel of color, The rapt revelations of sound; For the morning-blue above us And the rusted gold of the fern, For the chickadee's call of valor Bidding the faint-heart turn; "
838,THE TRAVELLER.,"For fire and running water, Snowfall and summer rain; For sunsets and quiet meadows, The fruit and the standing grain; For the solemn hour of moonrise Over the crest of trees, When the mellow lights are kindled In the lamps of the centuries; "
839,THE TRAVELLER.,"For those who wrought aforetime, Led by the mystic strain To strive for the larger freedom, And live for the greater gain; For plenty of peace and playtime, The homely goods of earth, And for rare immaterial treasures Accounted of little worth; "
840,THE TRAVELLER.,"For art and learning and friendship, Where beneficent truth is supreme,-- Those everlasting cities Built on the hills of dream; For all things growing and goodly That foster this life, and breed The immortal flower of wisdom Out of the mortal seed. "
841,THE TRAVELLER.,"But most of all for the spirit That cannot rest nor bide In stale and sterile convenience, Nor safety proven and tried, But still inspired and driven, Must seek what better may be, And up from the loveliest garden Must climb for a glimpse of sea. "
842,THE TRAVELLER.,Lines for a Picture 
843,THE TRAVELLER.,"When the leaves are flying Across the azure sky, Autumn on the hill top Turns to say good-by; "
844,THE TRAVELLER.,"In her gold-red tunic, Like an Eastern queen, With untarnished courage In her wilding mien. "
845,THE TRAVELLER.,"All the earth below her Answers to her gaze, And her eyes are pensive With remembered days. "
846,THE TRAVELLER.,"Yet, with cheek ensanguined, Gay at heart she goes On the great adventure Where the north wind blows. "
847,THE TRAVELLER.,The Deserted Pasture 
848,THE TRAVELLER.,"I love the stony pasture That no one else will have. The old gray rocks so friendly seem, So durable and brave. "
849,THE TRAVELLER.,"In tranquil contemplation It watches through the year. Seeing the frosty stars arise, The slender moons appear. "
850,THE TRAVELLER.,"Its music is the rain-wind, Its choristers the birds, And there are secrets in its heart Too wonderful for words. "
851,THE TRAVELLER.,"It keeps the bright-eyed creatures That play about its walls, Though long ago its milking herds Were banished from their stalls. "
852,THE TRAVELLER.,"Only the children come there, For buttercups in May, Or nuts in autumn, where it lies Dreaming the hours away. "
853,THE TRAVELLER.,"Long since its strength was given To making good increase, And now its soul is turned again To beauty and to peace. "
854,THE TRAVELLER.,"There in the early springtime The violets are blue, And adder-tongues in coats of gold Are garmented anew. "
855,THE TRAVELLER.,"There bayberry and aster Are crowded on its floors, When marching summer halts to praise The Lord of Out-of-doors. "
856,THE TRAVELLER.,"And there October passes In gorgeous livery,-- In purple ash, and crimson oak, And golden tulip tree. "
857,THE TRAVELLER.,"And when the winds of winter Their bugle blasts begin, The snowy hosts of heaven arrive And pitch their tents therein. "
858,THE TRAVELLER.,Autumn 
859,THE TRAVELLER.,"Now when the time of fruit and grain is come, When apples hang above the orchard wall, And from the tangle by the roadside stream A scent of wild grapes fills the racy air, Comes Autumn with her sunburnt caravan, Like a long gypsy train with trappings gay And tattered colors of the Orient, Moving slow-footed through the dreamy hills. The woods of Wilton at her coming wear Tints of Bokhara and of Samarcand: The maples glow with their Pompeian red, The hickories with burnt Etruscan gold; And while the crickets fife along her march, Behind her banners burns the crimson sun. "
860,THE TRAVELLER.,November Twilight 
861,THE TRAVELLER.,"Now Winter at the end of day Along the ridges takes her way, "
862,THE TRAVELLER.,Upon her twilight round to light The faithful candles of the night. 
863,THE TRAVELLER.,"As quiet as the nun she goes With silver lamp in hand, to close "
864,THE TRAVELLER.,The silent doors of dusk that keep The hours of memory and sleep. 
865,THE TRAVELLER.,She pauses to tread out the fires Where Autumn's festal train retires. 
866,THE TRAVELLER.,The last red embers smoulder down Behind the steeples of the town. 
867,THE TRAVELLER.,"Austere and fine the trees stand bare And moveless in the frosty air, "
868,THE TRAVELLER.,Against the pure and paling light Before the threshold of the night. 
869,THE TRAVELLER.,On purple valley and dim wood The timeless hush of solitude 
870,THE TRAVELLER.,"Is laid, as if the time for some Transcending mystery were come, "
871,THE TRAVELLER.,"That shall illumine and console The penitent and eager soul, "
872,THE TRAVELLER.,Setting her free to stand before Supernal beauty and adore. 
873,THE TRAVELLER.,"Dear Heart, in heaven's high portico It is the hour of prayer.  And lo, "
874,THE TRAVELLER.,"Above the earth, serene and still, One star--our star--o'er Lonetree Hill! "
875,THE TRAVELLER.,The Ghost-yard of the Goldenrod 
876,THE TRAVELLER.,"When the first silent frost has trod The ghost-yard of the goldenrod, "
877,THE TRAVELLER.,"And laid the blight of his cold hand Upon the warm autumnal land, "
878,THE TRAVELLER.,"And all things wait the subtle change That men call death, is it not strange "
879,THE TRAVELLER.,"That I--without a care or need, Who only am an idle weed-- "
880,THE TRAVELLER.,"Should wait unmoved, so frail, so bold, The coming of the final cold! "
881,THE TRAVELLER.,Before the Snow 
882,THE TRAVELLER.,"Now soon, ah, very soon, I know The trumpets of the north will blow, And the great winds will come to bring The pale, wild riders of the snow. "
883,THE TRAVELLER.,"Darkening the sun with level flight, At arrowy speed, they will alight, Unnumbered as the desert sands, To bivouac on the edge of night. "
884,THE TRAVELLER.,"Then I, within their somber ring, Shall hear a voice that seems to sing, Deep, deep within my tranquil heart, The valiant prophecy of spring. "
885,THE TRAVELLER.,Winter 
886,THE TRAVELLER.,"When winter comes along the river line And Earth has put away her green attire, With all the pomp of her autumnal pride, The world is made a sanctuary old, Where Gothic trees uphold the arch of gray, And gaunt stone fences on the ridge's crest Stand like carved screens before a crimson shrine, Showing the sunset glory through the chinks. There, like a nun with frosty breath, the soul, Uplift in adoration, sees the world Transfigured to a temple of her Lord; While down the soft blue-shadowed aisles of snow Night, like a sacristan with silent step, Passes to light the tapers of the stars. "
887,THE TRAVELLER.,A Winter Piece 
888,THE TRAVELLER.,"Over the rim of a lacquered bowl, Where a cold blue water-color stands, I see the wintry breakers roll And heave their froth up the freezing sands. "
889,THE TRAVELLER.,"Here in immunity safe and dull, Soul treads her circuit of trivial things. There soul's brother, a shining gull, Dares the rough weather on dauntless wings. "
890,THE TRAVELLER.,Winter Streams 
891,THE TRAVELLER.,"Now the little rivers go Muffled safely under snow, "
892,THE TRAVELLER.,"And the winding meadow streams Murmur in their wintry dreams, "
893,THE TRAVELLER.,"While a tinkling music wells Faintly from there icy bells, "
894,THE TRAVELLER.,Telling how their hearts are bold Though the very sun be cold. 
895,THE TRAVELLER.,"Ah, but wait until the rain Comes a-sighing once again, "
896,THE TRAVELLER.,Sweeping softly from the Sound Over ridge and meadow ground! 
897,THE TRAVELLER.,"Then the little streams will hear April calling far and near,-- "
898,THE TRAVELLER.,Slip their snowy bands and run Sparkling in the welcome sun. 
899,THE TRAVELLER.,Winter Twilight 
900,THE TRAVELLER.,"Along the wintry skyline, Crowning the rocky crest, Stands the bare screen of hardwood trees Against the saffron west,-- Its gray and purple network Of branching tracery Outspread upon the lucent air, Like weed within the sea. "
901,THE TRAVELLER.,"The scarlet robe of autumn Renounced and put away, The mystic Earth is fairer still,-- A Puritan in gray. The spirit of the winter, How tender, how austere! Yet all the ardor of the spring And summer's dream are here. "
902,THE TRAVELLER.,"Fear not, O timid lover, The touch of frost and rime! This is the virtue that sustained The roses in their prime. The anthem of the northwind Shall hallow thy despair, The benediction of the snow Be answer to thy prayer. "
903,THE TRAVELLER.,"And now the star of evening That is the pilgrim's sign, Is lighted in the primrose dusk,-- A lamp before a shrine. Peace fills the mighty minster, Tranquil and gray and old, And all the chancel of the west Is bright with paling gold. "
904,THE TRAVELLER.,"A little wind goes sifting Along the meadow floor,-- Like steps of lovely penitents Who sighingly adore. Then falls the twilight curtain, And fades the eerie light, And frost and silence turn the keys In the great doors of night. "
905,THE TRAVELLER.,The Twelfth Night Star 
906,THE TRAVELLER.,"It is the bitter time of year When iron is the ground, With hasp and sheathing of black ice The forest lakes are bound, The world lies snugly under snow, Asleep without a sound. "
907,THE TRAVELLER.,"All the night long in trooping squares The sentry stars go by, The silent and unwearying hosts That bear man company, And with their pure enkindling fires Keep vigils lone and high. "
908,THE TRAVELLER.,"Through the dead hours before the dawn, When the frost snaps the sill, From chestnut-wooded ridge to sea The earth lies dark and still, Till one great silver planet shines Above the eastern hill. "
909,THE TRAVELLER.,"It is the star of Gabriel, The herald of the Word In days when messengers of God With sons of men conferred, Who brought the tidings of great joy The watching shepherds heard; "
910,THE TRAVELLER.,"The mystic light that moved to lead The wise of long ago, Out of the great East where they dreamed Of truths they could not know, To seek some good that should assuage The world's most ancient woe. "
911,THE TRAVELLER.,"O well, believe, they loved their dream, Those children of the star, Who saw the light and followed it, Prophetical, afar,-- Brave Caspar, clear-eyed Melchior, And eager Balthasar. "
912,THE TRAVELLER.,"Another year slips to the void, And still with omen bright Above the sleeping doubting world The day-star is alight,-- The waking signal flashed of old In the blue Syrian night. "
913,THE TRAVELLER.,"But who are now as wise as they Whose faith could read the sign Of the three gifts that shall suffice To honor the divine, And show the tread of common life Ineffably benign? "
914,THE TRAVELLER.,"Whoever wakens on a day Happy to know and be, To enjoy the air, to love his kind, To labor, to be free,-- Already his enraptured soul Lives in eternity. "
915,THE TRAVELLER.,"For him with every rising sun The year begins anew; The fertile earth receives her lord, And prophecy comes true, Wondrously as a fall of snow, Dear as a drench of dew. "
916,THE TRAVELLER.,"Who gives his life for beauty's need, King Caspar could no more; Who serves the truth with single mind Shall stand with Melchior; And love is all that Balthasar In crested censer bore. "
917,THE TRAVELLER.,A Christmas Eve Choral 
918,THE TRAVELLER.,_Halleluja! What sound is this across the dark While all the earth is sleeping?  Hark! Halleluja!  Halleluja!  Halleluja!_ 
919,THE TRAVELLER.,"Why are thy tender eyes so bright, Mary, Mary? On the prophetic deep of night Joseph, Joseph, I see the borders of the light, And in the day that is to be An aureoled man-child I see, Great love's son, Joseph. "
920,THE TRAVELLER.,"_Halleluja! He hears not, but she hears afar, The Minstrel Angel of the star. Halleluja!  Halleluja!  Halleluja!_ "
921,THE TRAVELLER.,"Why is thy gentle smile so deep, Mary, Mary? It is the secret I must keep, Joseph, Joseph,-- The joy that will not let me sleep, The glory of the coming days, When all the world shall turn to praise God's goodness, Joseph. "
922,THE TRAVELLER.,_Halleluja! Clear as the bird that brings the morn She hears the heavenly music borne. Halleluja!  Halleluja!  Halleluja!_ 
923,THE TRAVELLER.,"Why is thy radiant face so calm, Mary, Mary? His strength is like a royal palm, Joseph, Joseph; His beauty like the victor's psalm. He moves like morning o'er the lands And there is healing in his hands For sorrow, Joseph. "
924,THE TRAVELLER.,_Halleluja! Tender as dew-fall on the earth She hears the choral of love's birth. Halleluja!  Halleluja!  Halleluja!_ 
925,THE TRAVELLER.,"What is the message come to thee, Mary, Mary? I hear like wind within the tree, Joseph, Joseph, Or like a far-off melody His deathless voice proclaiming peace, And bidding ruthless wrong to cease, For love's sake, Joseph. "
926,THE TRAVELLER.,_Halleluja! Moving as rain-wind in the spring She hears the angel chorus ring. Halleluja!  Halleluja!  Halleluja!_ 
927,THE TRAVELLER.,"Why are thy patient hands so still, Mary, Mary? I see the shadow on the hill, Joseph, Joseph, And wonder if it is God's will That courage, service, and glad youth Shall perish in the cause of truth Forever, Joseph. "
928,THE TRAVELLER.,_Halleluja! Her heart in that celestial chime Has heard the harmony of time. Halleluja!  Halleluja!  Halleluja!_ 
929,THE TRAVELLER.,"Why is thy voice so strange and far, Mary, Mary? I see the glory of the star, Joseph, Joseph; And in its light all things that are, Made glad and wise beyond the sway Of death and darkness and dismay, In God's time Joseph. "
930,THE TRAVELLER.,_Halleluja! To every heart in love 'tis given To hear the ecstasy of heaven. Halleluja!  Halleluja!  Halleluja._ 
931,THE TRAVELLER.,Christmas Song 
932,THE TRAVELLER.,"Above the weary waiting world, Asleep in chill despair, There breaks a sound of joyous bells Upon the frosted air. And o'er the humblest rooftree, lo, A star is dancing on the snow. "
933,THE TRAVELLER.,"What makes the yellow star to dance Upon the brink of night? What makes the breaking dawn to glow So magically bright,-- And all the earth to be renewed With infinite beatitude? "
934,THE TRAVELLER.,"The singing bells, the throbbing star, The sunbeams on the snow, And the awakening heart that leaps New ecstasy to know,-- They all are dancing in the morn Because a little child is born. "
935,THE TRAVELLER.,The Wise Men from the East 
936,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON) 
937,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"_Why were the Wise Men three, Instead of five or seven?""_ They had to match, you see, The archangels in Heaven. "
938,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"God sent them, sure and swift, By his mysterious presage, To bear the threefold gift And take the threefold message. "
939,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Thus in their hands were seen The gold of purest Beauty, The myrrh of Truth all-clean, The frankincense of Duty. "
940,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And thus they bore away The loving heart's great treasure, And knowledge clear as day, To be our life's new measure. "
941,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),They went back to the East To spread the news of gladness. There one became a priest To the new word of sadness; 
942,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And one a workman, skilled Beyond the old earth's fashion; And one a scholar, filled With learning's endless passion. "
943,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"God sent them for a sign He would not change nor alter His good and fair design, However man may falter. "
944,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"He meant that, as He chose His perfect plan and willed it, They stood in place of those Who elsewhere had fulfilled it; "
945,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Whoso would mark and reach The height of man's election, Must still achieve and teach The triplicate perfection. "
946,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"For since the world was made, One thing was needed ever, To keep man undismayed Through failure and endeavor-- "
947,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A faultless trinity Of body, mind, and spirit, And each with its own three Strong angels to be near it; "
948,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Strength to arise and go Wherever dawn is breaking, Poise like the tides that flow, Instinct for beauty-making; "
949,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Imagination bold To cross the mystic border, Reason to seek and hold, Judgment for law and order; "
950,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Joy that makes all things well, Faith that is all-availing Each terror to dispel, And Love, ah, Love unfailing. "
951,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"These are the flaming Nine Who walk the world unsleeping, Sent forth by the Divine With manhood in their keeping. "
952,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"These are the seraphs strong His mighty soul had need of, When He would right the wrong And sorrow He took heed of. "
953,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And that, I think, is why The Wise Men knelt before Him, And put their kingdoms by To serve Him and adore Him; "
954,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"So that our Lord, unknown, Should not be unattended, When He was here alone And poor and unbefriended; "
955,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"That still He might have three (Rather than five or seven) To stand in their degree, Like archangels in Heaven. "
956,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The Sending of the Magi 
957,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In a far Eastern country It happened long of yore, Where a lone and level sunrise Flushes the desert floor, That three kings sat together And a spearman kept the door. "
958,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Caspar, whose wealth was counted By city and caravan; With Melchior, the seer Who read the starry plan; And Balthasar, the blameless, Who loved his fellow man. "
959,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"There while they talked, a sudden Strange rushing sound arose, And as with startled faces They thought upon their foes, Three figures stood before them In imperial repose. "
960,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"One in flame-gold and one in blue And one in scarlet clear, With the almighty portent Of sunrise they drew near! And the kings made obeisance With hand on breast, in fear. "
961,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""Arise,"" said they, ""we bring you Good tidings of great peace! To-day a power is wakened Whose working must increase, Till fear and greed and malice And violence shall cease."" "
962,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The messengers were Michael, By whom all things are wrought To shape and hue; and Gabriel Who is the lord of thought; And Rafael without whose love All toil must come to nought. "
963,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then Rafael said to Balthasar, ""In a country west from here A lord is born in lowliness, In love without a peer. Take grievances and gifts to him And prove his kingship clear! "
964,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""By this sign ye shall know him; Within his mother's arm Among the sweet-breathed cattle He slumbers without harm, While wicked hearts are troubled And tyrants take alarm."" "
965,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And Gabriel said to Melchior, ""My comrade, I will send My star to go before you, That ye may comprehend Where leads your mystic learning In a humaner trend."" "
966,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And Michael said to Gaspar, ""Thou royal builder, go With tribute of thy riches! Though time shall overthrow Thy kingdom, no undoing His gentle might shall know."" "
967,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then while the kings' hearts greatened And all the chamber shone, As when the hills at sundown Take a new glory on And the air thrills with purple, Their visitors were gone. "
968,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then straightway up rose Gaspar, Melchior and Balthasar, And passed out through the murmur Of palace and bazar, To make without misgiving The journey of the Star. "
969,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The Angels of Man 
970,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The word of the Lord of the outer worlds Went forth on the deeps of space, That Michael, Gabriel, Rafael, Should stand before his face, The seraphs of his threefold will, Each in his ordered place. "
971,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Brave Michael, the right hand of God, Strong Gabriel, his voice, Fair Rafael, his holy breath That makes the world rejoice,-- Archangels of omnipotence, Of knowledge, and of choice; "
972,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Michael, angel of loveliness In all things that survive, And Gabriel, whose part it is To ponder and contrive, And Rafael, who puts the heart In every thing alive. "
973,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Came Rafael, the enraptured soul, Stainless as wind or fire, The urge within the flux of things, The life that must aspire, With whom is the beginning, The worth, and the desire; "
974,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And Gabriel, the all-seeing mind, Bringer of truth and light, Who lays the courses of the stars In their stupendous flight, And calls the migrant flocks of spring Across the purple night; "
975,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And Michael, the artificer Of beauty, shape, and hue, Lord of the forges of the sun, The crucible of the dew, And driver of the plowing rain When the flowers are born anew. "
976,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then said the Lord: ""Ye shall account For the ministry ye hold, Since ye have been my sons to keep My purpose from of old. How fare the realms within your sway To perfections still untold?"" "
977,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Answered each as he had the word. And a great silence fell On all the listening hosts of heaven To hear their captains tell,-- With the breath of the wind, the call of a bird. And the cry of a mighty bell. "
978,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then the Lord said: ""The time is ripe For finishing my plan, And the accomplishment of that For which all time began. Therefore on you is laid the task Of the fashioning of man; "
979,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""In your own likeness shall he be, To triumph in the end. I only give him Michael's strength To guard him and defend, With Gabriel to be his guide, And Rafael his friend. "
980,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""Ye shall go forth upon the earth, And make there Paradise, And be the angels of that place To make men glad and wise, With loving-kindness in their hearts, And knowledge in their eyes. "
981,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""And ye shall be man's counsellors That neither rest nor sleep, To cheer the lonely, lift the frail, And solace them that weep. And ever on his wandering trail Your watch-fires ye shall keep; "
982,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""Till in the far years he shall find The country of his quest, The empire of the open truth, The vision of the best, Foreseen by every mother saint With her new-born on her breast."" "
983,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),At the Making of Man 
984,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"_First all the host of Raphael In liveries of gold, Lifted the chorus on whose rhythm The spinning spheres are rolled,-- The Seraphs of the morning calm Whose hearts are never cold._ "
985,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"He shall be born a spirit, Part of the soul that yearns, The core of vital gladness That suffers and discerns, The stir that breaks the budding sheath When the green spring returns,-- "
986,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The gist of power and patience Hid in the plasmic clay, The calm behind the senses, The passionate essay To make his wise and lovely dream Immortal on a day. "
987,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The soft, Aprilian ardors That warm the waiting loam Shall whisper in his pulses To bid him overcome, And he shall learn the wonder-cry Beneath the azure dome. "
988,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And though all-dying nature Should teach him to deplore, The ruddy fires of autumn Shall lure him but the more To pass from joy to stronger joy, As through an open door. "
989,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"He shall have hope and honor, Proud trust and courage stark, To hold him to his purpose Through the unlighted dark, And love that sees the moon's full orb In the first silver arc. "
990,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And he shall live by kindness And the heart's certitude, Which moves without misgiving In ways not understood, Sure only of the vast event,-- The large and simple good. "
991,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"_Then Gabriel's host in silver gear And vesture twilight blue, The spirits of immortal mind, The warders of the true, Took up the theme that gives the world Significance anew._ "
992,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"He shall be born to reason, And have the primal need To understand and follow Wherever truth may lead,-- To grow in wisdom like a tree Unfolding from a seed. "
993,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A watcher by the sheepfolds, With wonder in his eyes, He shall behold the seasons, And mark the planets rise, Till all the marching firmament Shall rouse his vast surmise. "
994,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Beyond the sweep of vision, Or utmost reach of sound, This cunning fire-maker, This tiller of the ground, Shall learn the secrets of the suns And fathom the profound. "
995,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"For he must prove all being Sane, beauteous, benign, And at the heart of nature Discover the divine,-- Himself the type and symbol Of the eternal trine. "
996,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"He shall perceive the kindling Of knowledge, far and dim, As of the fire that brightens Below the dark sea-rim, When ray by ray the splendid sun Floats to the world's wide brim. "
997,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And out of primal instinct, The lore of lair and den, He shall emerge to question How, wherefore, whence, and when, Till the last frontier of the truth Shall lie within his ken. "
998,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"_Then Michael's scarlet-suited host Took up the word and sang; As though a trumpet had been loosed In heaven, the arches rang; For these were they who feel the thrill Of beauty like a pang._ "
999,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"He shall be framed and balanced For loveliness and power, Lithe as the supple creatures, And colored as a flower, Sustained by the all-feeding earth, Nurtured by wind and shower, "
1000,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"To stand within the vortex Where surging forces play, A poised and pliant figure Immutable as they, Till time and space and energy Surrenders to his sway. "
1001,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"He shall be free to journey Over the teeming earth, An insatiable seeker, A wanderer from his birth, Clothed in the fragile veil of sense, With fortitude for girth. "
1002,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"His hands shall have dominion Of all created things, To fashion in the likeness Of his imaginings, To make his will and thought survive Unto a thousand springs. "
1003,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The world shall be his province, The princedom of his skill; The tides shall wear his harness, The winds obey his will; Till neither flood, nor fire, nor frost, Shall work to do him ill. "
1004,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A creature fit to carry The pure creative fire, Whatever truth inform him, Whatever good inspire, He shall make lovely in all things To the end of his desire. "
1005,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),St. Michael's Star 
1006,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In the pure solitude of dusk One star is set to shine Above the sundown's dying rose, A lamp before a shrine. It is the star of Michael lit In the minster of the sun, That every toiling hand may give Thanks for the day's work done. "
1007,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"For when the almighty word went forth To bid creation be,-- The glimmering star-tracks on the blue, The tide-belts on the sea,-- Perfect as planned, from Michael's hand The lasting hills arose, Their bases on the poppied plain, Their peaks in bannered snows. "
1008,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Cedar and thorn and oak were born; Green fiddleheads uncurled In the spring woods; gold adder-tongues Came forth to glad the world;-- The magic of the punctual seeds, Each with its pregnant powers, As the lord Michael fashioned them To keep their days and hours. "
1009,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Frail fins to ride the monstrous tide, Soft wings to poise and gleam, He formed the pageant tribe by tribe As vivid as a dream. And still must his beneficence Renew, create, sustain, Sorcery of the wind and sun, Alchemy of the rain. "
1010,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Teeming with God, the kindly sod Yearns through the summer days With the mute eloquence of flowers, Its only means of praise. At dusk and dawn the tranquil hills Throb to the song of birds, And all the dim blue silence thrills To transport not of words. "
1011,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"For earth must breed to spirit's need, Clay to the finer clay, That soul through sense find recompense And rapture on her way. And man, from dust and dreaming wrought, To all things must impart The trend and likeness of his thought, The passion of his heart. "
1012,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The love and lore he shall acquire To word and deed must dare; Resemblances of God his sire His voice and mien must bear. His children's children shall portray The skill which he bestows On living; and what life must mean His craftsman's instinct knows. 
1013,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Line upon line and tone by tone, The visioned form he gives To sound and color, wood and stone, Takes loveliness and lives. He sees his project's soaring hope Grow substance, and expand To measure a diviner scope Beneath his patient hand. "
1014,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"To pencil, brush, and burnisher His wizardry he lends, And to the care of lathe and loom His secret he commends. In hues and forms and cadences New beauty he instills, A brother by the right of craft To Michael of the hills. "
1015,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The Dreamers 
1016,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Charlemagne with knight and lord, In the hill at Ingelheim, Slumbers at the council board, Seated waiting for the time. "
1017,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With their swords across their knees In that chamber dimly lit, Chin on breast life effigies Of the dreaming gods, they sit. "
1018,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Long ago they went to sleep, While great wars above them hurled. Taking counsel how to keep Giant evil from the world. "
1019,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Golden-armored, iron-crowned, There in silence they await The last war,--in war renowned, Done with doubting and debate. "
1020,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"What is all our clamor for? Petty virtue, puny crime, Beat in vain against the door Of the hill at Ingelheim. "
1021,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"When at last shall dawn the day For the saving of the world, They will forth in war array, Iron-armored, golden-curled. "
1022,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In the hill at Ingelheim, Still, they say, the Emperor, Like a warrior in his prime, Waits the message at the door. "
1023,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Shall the long enduring fight Break above our heads in vain, Plunged in lethargy and night, Like the men of Charlemagne? "
1024,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Comrades, through the Council Hall Of the heart, inert and dumb, Hear ye not the summoning call, ""Up, my lords, the hour is come!"" "
1025,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),El Dorado 
1026,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"This is the story Of Santo Domingo, The first established Permanent city Built in the New World. "
1027,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Miguel Dias, A Spanish sailor In the fleet of Columbus, Fought with a captain, Wounded him, then in fear Fled from his punishment. "
1028,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Ranging the wilds, he came On a secluded Indian village Of the peace-loving Comely Caguisas. There he found shelter, Food, fire, and hiding,-- Welcome unstinted. "
1029,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Over this tribe ruled-- No cunning chieftain Grown gray in world-craft, But a young soft-eyed Girl, tender-hearted, Loving, and regal Only in beauty, With no suspicion Of the perfidious Merciless gold-lust Of the white sea-wolves,-- Roving, rapacious, Conquerors, destroyers. Strongly the stranger Wooed with his foreign Manners, his Latin Fervor and graces; Beat down her gentle, Unreserved strangeness; "
1030,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Made himself consort Of a young queen, all Loveliness, ardor, And generous devotion. Her world she gave him, Nothing denied him, All, all for love's sake Poured out before him,-- Lived but to pleasure And worship her lover. "
1031,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Such is the way Of free-hearted women, Radiant beings Who carry God's secret; All their seraphic Unworldly wisdom Spent without fearing Or calculation For the enrichment Of--whom, what, and wherefore? "
1032,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Ask why the sun shines And is not measured, Ask why the rain falls Aeon by aeon, Ask why the wind comes Making the strong trees Blossom in springtime, Forever unwearied! Whoever earned these gifts, Air, sun, and water? Whoever earned his share In that unfathomed Full benediction, "
1033,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Passing the old earth's Cunningest knowledge, Greater than all The ambition of ages, Light as a thistle-seed, Strong as a tide-run, Vast and mysterious As the night sky,-- The love of woman? Not long did Miguel Dias abide content With his good fortune. Back to his voyaging Turned his desire, Restless once more to rove With boon companions, Filled with the covetous Thirst for adventure,-- The white man's folly. "
1034,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then poor Zamcaca, In consternation Lest she lack merit Worthy to tether His wayward fancy, Knowing no way but love, Guileless, and sedulous Only to gladden, Quick and sweet-souled As another madonna, Gave him the secret Of her realm's treasure,-- Raw gold unweighed, Stored wealth unimagined; Decked him with trappings Of that yellow peril; And bade him go Bring his comrades to settle In her dominion. "
1035,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Not long the Spaniards Stood on that bidding. Gold was their madness, Their Siren and Pandar. Trooping they followed Their friend the explorer, Greed-fevered ravagers Of all things goodly, Hot-foot to plunder The land of his love-dream. They swooped on that country, Founded their city, Made Miguel Dias Its first Alcalde,-- Flattered and fooled him, Loud in false praises For the great wealth he had By his love's bounty. "
1036,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then the old story, Older than Adam,-- Treachery, rapine, Ingratitude, bloodshed, Wrought by the strong man On unsuspecting And gentler brothers. The rabid Spaniard, Christian and ruthless (Like any modern Magnate of Mammon), Harried that fearless, Light-hearted, trustful folk Under his booted heel. Tears (ah, a woman's tears,-- The grief of angels,--) Fell from Zamcaca, Sorrowing, hopeless, Alone, for her people. "
1037,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Sick from injustice, Distraught, and disheartened, Tortured by sight and sound Of wrong and ruin, When the kind, silent, Tropical moonlight, Lay on the city, In the dead hour When the soul trembles Within the portals Of its own province, While far away seem "
1038,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"All deeds of daytime, She rose and wondered; Gazed on the sleeping Face of her loved one, Alien and cruel; Kissed her strange children, Longingly laying a hand In farewell on each, Crept to the door, and fled Back to the forest. "
1039,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Only the deep heart Of the World-mother, Brooding below the storms Of human madness, Can know what desolate Anguish possessed her. "
1040,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Only the far mind Of the World-father, Seeing the mystic End and beginning, Knows why the pageant Is so betattered With mortal sorrow. "
1041,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),On the Plaza 
1042,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"One August day I sat beside A caf√© window open wide To let the shower-freshened air Blow in across the Plaza, where In golden pomp against the dark Green leafy background of the Park, St. Gaudens' hero, gaunt and grim, Rides on with Victory leading him. "
1043,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The wet, black asphalt seemed to hold In every hollow pools of gold, And clouds of gold and pink and gray Were piled up at the end of day, Far down the cross street, where one tower Still glistened from the drenching shower. "
1044,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A weary, white-haired man went by, Cooling his forehead gratefully After the day's great heat.  A girl, Her thin white garments in a swirl Blown back against her breasts and knees, Like a Winged Victory in the breeze, Alive and modern and superb, Crossed from the circle of the curb. "
1045,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"We sat there watching people pass, Clinking the ice against the glass And talking idly--books or art, Or something equally apart From the essential stress and strife That rudely form and further life, Glad of a respite from the heat, When down the middle of the street, Trundling a hurdy-gurdy, gay In spite of the dull-stifling day, Three street-musicians came.  The man, With hair and beard as black as Pan, Strolled on one side with lordly grace, While a young girl tugged at a trace Upon the other.  And between The shafts there walked a laughing queen, Bright as a poppy, strong and free. What likelier land than Italy Breeds such abandon?  Confident And rapturous in mere living spent Each moment to the utmost, there With broad, deep chest and kerchiefed hair, With head thrown back, bare throat, and waist Supple, heroic and free-laced, Between her two companions walked This splendid woman, chaffed and talked, Did half the work, made all the cheer Of that small company. "
1046,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"No fear Of failure in a soul like hers That every moment throbs and stirs With merry ardor, virile hope, Brave effort, nor in all its scope Has room for thought or discontent, Each day its own sufficient vent And source of happiness. "
1047,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Without A trace of bitterness or doubt Of life's true worth, she strode at ease Before those empty palaces, A simple heiress of the earth And all its joys by happy birth, Beneficent as breeze or dew, And fresh as though the world were new And toil and grief were not.  How rare A personality was there! "
1048,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),A Painter's Holiday 
1049,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"We painters sometimes strangely keep These holidays.  When life runs deep And broad and strong, it comes to make Its own bright-colored almanack. Impulse and incident divine Must find their way through tone and line; The throb of color and the dream Of beauty, giving art its theme From dear life's daily miracle, Illume the artist's life as well. A bird-note, or a turning leaf, The first white fall of snow, a brief Wild song from the Anthology, A smile, or a girl's kindling eye,-- And there is worth enough for him To make the page of history dim. Who knows upon what day may come The touch of that delirium Which lifts plain life to the divine, And teaches hand the magic line No cunning rule could ever reach, Where Soul's necessities find speech? None knows how rapture may arrive To be our helper, and survive Through our essay to help in turn All starving eager souls who yearn Lightward discouraged and distraught. Ah, once art's gleam of glory caught And treasured in the heart, how then We walk enchanted among men, And with the elder gods confer! So art is hope's interpreter, And with devotion must conspire To fan the eternal altar fire. Wherefore you find me here to-day, Not idling the good hours away, But picturing a magic hour With its replenishment of power. "
1050,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Conceive a bleak December day, The streets all mire, the sky all gray, And a poor painter trudging home Disconsolate, when what should come Across his vision, but a line On a bold-lettered play-house sign, _A Persian Sun Dance_. "
1051,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In he turns. A step, and there the desert burns Purple and splendid; molten gold The streamers of the dawn unfold, Amber and amethyst uphurled Above the far rim of the world; The long-held sound of temple bells Over the hot sand steals and swells; A lazy tom-tom throbs and dones In barbarous maddening monotones; While sandal incense blue and keen Hangs in the air.  And then the scene Wakes, and out steps, by rhythm released, The sorcery of all the East, In rose and saffron gossamer,-- A young light-hearted worshipper Who dances up the sun.  She moves Like waking woodland flower that loves To greet the day.  Her lithe, brown curve Is like a sapling's sway and swerve Before the spring wind.  Her dark hair Framing a face vivid and rare, Curled to her throat and then flew wild, Like shadows round a radiant child. The sunlight from her cymbals played About her dancing knees, and made A world of rose-lit ecstasy, Prophetic of the day to be. "
1052,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Such mystic beauty might have shone In Sardis or in Babylon, To bring a Satrap to his doom Or touch some lad with glory's bloom. And now it wrought for me, with sheer Enchantment of the dying year, Its irresistible reprieve From joylessness on New Year's Eve. "
1053,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),Mirage 
1054,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Here hangs at last, you see, my row Of sketches,--all I have to show Of one enchanted summer spent In sweet laborious content, At little 'Sconset by the moors, With the sea thundering by its doors, Its grassy streets, and gardens gay With hollyhocks and salvia. "
1055,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And here upon the easel yet, With the last brush of paint still wet, (Showing how inspiration toils), Is one where the white surf-line boils Along the sand, and the whole sea Lifts to the skyline, just to be The wondrous background from whose verge Of blue on blue there should emerge This miracle. "
1056,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"One day of days I strolled the silent path that strays Between the moorlands and the beach From Siasconset, till you reach Tom Nevers Head, the lone last land That fronts the ocean, lone and grand As when the Lord first bade it be For a surprise and mystery. A sailless sea, a cloudless sky, The level lonely moors, and I The only soul in all that vast Of color made intense to last! The small white sea-birds piping near; The great soft moor-winds; and the dear Bright sun that pales each crest to jade, Where gulls glint fishing unafraid. "
1057,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Here man, the godlike, might have gone With his deep thought, on that wild dawn When the first sun came from the sea, Glowing and kindling the world to be, While time began and joy had birth,-- No wilder sweeter spot on earth! "
1058,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"As I sat there and mused (the way We painters waste our time, you say!) On the sheer loneliness and strength Whence life must spring, there came at length Conviction of the helplessness Of earth alone to ban or bless. I saw the huge unhuman sea; I heard the drear monotony Of the waves beating on the shore With heedless, futile strife and roar, Without a meaning or an aim. "
1059,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And then a revelation came, In subtle, sudden, lovely guise, Like one of those soft mysteries Of Indian jugglers, who evoke A flower for you out of smoke. I knew sheer beauty without soul Could never be perfection's goal, Nor satisfy the seeking mind With all it longs for and must find One day.  The lovely things that haunt Our senses with an aching want, And move our souls, are like the fair Lost garments of a soul somewhere. Nature is naught, if not the veil Of some great good that must prevail And break in joy, as woods of spring Break into song and blossoming. "
1060,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"But what makes that great goodness start Within ourselves?  When leaps the heart With gladness, only then we know Why lovely Nature travails so,-- Why art must persevere and pray In her incomparable way. In all the world the only worth Is human happiness; its dearth The darkest ill.  Let joyance be, And there is God's sufficiency,-- Such joy as only can abound Where the heart's comrade has been found. "
1061,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"That was my thought.  And then the sea Broke in upon my revery With clamorous beauty,--the superb Eternal noun that takes no verb But love.  The heaven of dove-like blue Bent o'er the azure, round and true As magic sphere of crystal glass, Where faith sees plain the pageant pass Of things unseen.  So I beheld The sheer sky-arches domed and belled, As if the sea were the very floor Of heaven where walked the gods of yore In Plato's imagery, and I Uplifted saw their pomps go by. "
1062,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The House of space and time grew tense As if with rapture's imminence, When truth should be at last made clear, And the great worth of life appear; While I, a worshipper at the shrine, For very longing grew divine, Borne upward on earth's ecstasy, And welcomed by the boundless sky. "
1063,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"A mighty prescience seemed to brood Over that tenuous solitude Yearning for form, till it became Vivid as dream and live as flame, Through magic art could never match, The vision I have tried to catch,-- All earth's delight and meaning grown A lyric presence loved and known. "
1064,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"How otherwise could time evolve Young courage, or the high resolve, Or gladness to assuage and bless The soul's austere great loneliness, Than by providing her somehow With sympathy of hand and brow, And bidding her at last go free, Companioned through eternity? "
1065,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"So there appeared before my eyes, In a beloved, familiar guise, A vivid, questing human face In profile, scanning heaven for grace, Up-gazing there against the blue With eyes that heaven itself shone through; The lips soft-parted, half in prayer, Half confident of kindness there; A brow like Plato's made for dream In some immortal Academe, And tender as a happy girl's; A full dark head of clustered curls Round as an emperor's, where meet Repose and ardor, strong and sweet, Distilling from a mind unmarred The glory of her rapt regard. "
1066,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"So eager Mary might have stood, In love's adoring attitude, And looked into the angel's eyes With faith and fearlessness, all wise In soul's unfaltering innocence, Sure in her woman's supersense Of things only the humble know. My vision looks forever so. "
1067,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"In other years when men shall say, ""What was the painter's meaning, pray? Why all this vast of sea and space, Just to enframe a woman's face?"" Here is the pertinent reply, ""What better use for earth and sky?"" "
1068,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"The great archangel passed that way Illuming life with mystic ray. Not Lippo's self nor Raphael Had lovelier, realer things to tell Than I, beholding far away How all the melting rose and gray Upon the purple sea-line leaned About that head that intervened. "
1069,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"How real was she?  Ah, my friend, In art the fact and fancy blend Past telling.  All the painter's task Is with the glory.  Need we ask The tulips breaking through the mould To their untarnished age of gold, Whence their ideals were derived That have so gloriously survived? Flowers and painters both must give The hint they have received, to live,-- Spend without stint the joy and power That lurk in each propitious hour,-- Yet leave the why untold--God's way. "
1070,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),My sketch is all I have to say. 
1071,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The Winged Victory 
1072,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Thou dear and most high Victory, Whose home is the unvanquished sea, Whose fluttering wind-blown garments keep The very freshness, fold, and sweep They wore upon the galley's prow, By what unwonted favor now Hast thou alighted in this place, Thou Victory of Samothrace? "
1073,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"O thou to whom in countless lands With eager hearts and striving hands Strong men in their last need have prayed, Greatly desiring, undismayed, And thou hast been across the fight Their consolation and their might, Withhold not now one dearer grace, Thou Victory of Samothrace! "
1074,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Behold, we, too, must cry to thee, Who wage our strife with Destiny, And give for Beauty and for Truth Our love, our valor and our youth. Are there no honors for these things To match the pageantries of kings? Are we more laggard in the race Than those who fell at Samothrace? "
1075,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Not only for the bow and sword, O Victory, be thy reward! The hands that work with paint and clay In Beauty's service, shall not they Also with mighty faith prevail? Let hope not die, nor courage fail, But joy come with thee pace for pace, As once long since in Samothrace. "
1076,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Grant us the skill to shape the form And spread the color living-warm, (As they who wrought aforetime did), Where love and wisdom shall lie hid, In fair impassioned types, to sway The cohorts of the world to-day, In Truth's eternal cause, and trace Thy glory down from Samothrace. "
1077,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"With all the ease and splendid poise Of one who triumphs without noise, Wilt thou not teach us to attain Thy sense of power without strain, That we a little may possess Our souls with thy sure loveliness,-- That calm the years cannot deface, Thou Victory of Samothrace? "
1078,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then in the ancient, ceaseless war With infamy, go thou before! Amid the shoutings and the drums Let it be learned that Beauty comes, Man's matchless Paladin to be, Whose rule shall make his spirit free As thine from all things mean or base, Thou Victory of Samothrace. "
1079,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),The Gate of Peace 
1080,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Ah, who will build the city of our dream, Where beauty shall abound and truth avail, With patient love that is too wise for strife, Blending in power as gentle as the rain With the reviving earth on full spring days? Who now will speed us to its gate of peace, And reassure us on our doubtful road? "
1081,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Three centuries ago a fearless man, Yearning to set his people in the way, Threw all his royal might into a plan To found an ideal city that should give Freedom to every instinct for the best, From humblest impulse in his own domain To rumored wisdom from the world's far ends. Strengthened with ardor from a high resolve, Beneath the patient smile of Indian skies This fair dream flourished for a score of years, Until the blight of evil touched its bloom With fading, and transformed its vivid life Into a ghost-flower of its fair design. "
1082,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Now ruined nursery tower and gay boudoir, A sad custodian of sacred tombs, And scattered feathers from the purple wings Of doves who reign in undisputed calm Over this Eden of hope and fair essay, Recall the valor of this ancient quest. "
1083,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Great Akbar,--grandfather of Shah Jehan, The artist Emperor of India Who built the Taj for love of one held dear Beyond all other women in the world, And left that loveliest memorial, The most supreme of wonders wrought by man, To move for very joy all hearts to tears Beholding how great beauty springs from love,-- Akbar the wisest ruler over Ind, Grandson of Babar in whose veins were mixed The blood of Tamerlane and Chinghiz Khan, Who beat the Afghans and the Rajputs down At Paniput and Buxar in Bengal, Making himself the lord of Hindustan, And with his restless Tartars founded there The Mogul empire with its Moslem faith, Its joyousness, enlightenment, and art,-- Akbar of all the sovereigns of the East Is still most deeply loved and gladly praised. "
1084,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"For he who conquered with so strong a hand Cabul, Kashmir, and Kandahar, and Sind, Oudh and Orissa, Chitor and Ajmir, With all their wealth to weld them into one, Upholding justice with his sovereignty Throughout his borders and imposing peace, Was first and last a seeker after truth. "
1085,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"No craven unlaborious truce he sought, But that great peace which only comes with light, Emerging after chaos has been quelled In some long struggle of enduring will, To be a proof of order and of law, Which cannot rest on falsehood nor on wrong, But spreads like generous sunshine on the earth When goodness has been gained and truth made clear, At whatsoe'er incalculable cost. Returning once with his victorious arms And war-worn companies on the homeward march To Agra and his court's magnificence, From a campaign against some turbulent folk, He came at evening to a quiet place Near Sikri by the roadside through the woods, Where there were many doves among the trees. "
1086,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"There Salim Chisti a holy man had made His lonely dwelling in the wilderness, Seeking perfection.  And the solitude Was sweet to Akbar, and he halted there And went to Salim in his lodge and said, ""O man and brother, thy long days are spent In meditation, seeking for the path Through this great world's impediments to peace, Here in the twilight with the holy stars Or when the rose of morning breaks in gold; Tell me, I pray, whence comes the gift of peace With all its blessings for a people's need, And how may true tranquillity be found On which man's restless spirit longs to rest?"" "
1087,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And Salim answered, ""Lord, most readily In Allah's out-of-doors, for there men live More truly, being free from false constraint, For learning wisdom with a calmer mind. For they who would find peace must conquer fear And ignorance and greed,--the ravagers Of spirit, mind, and sense,--and learn to live Content beneath the shade of Allah's hand. Who worships not his own will shall find peace."" "
1088,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then Akbar answered, ""I have set my heart On making beauty, truth, and justice shine As the ordered stars above the darkened earth. Are not these also things to be desired, And striven for with no uncertain toil? And save through them whence comes the gift of peace?"" "
1089,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Then Salim smiled, and with his finger drew In the soft dust before his door, and said, ""O king, thy words are true, thy heart most wise. Thou also shalt find peace, as Allah wills, Through following bravely what to thee seems best. When any question, 'What is peace?' reply, 'The shelter of the Gate of Paradise, The shadow of the archway, not the arch, Within whose shade at need the poor may rest, The weary be refreshed, the weak secure, And all men pause to gladden as they go.'"" "
1090,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And Akbar pondered Salim Chisti's words. Then turning to his ministers, he said, ""Here will I build my capital, and here The world shall come unto a council hall, And in a place of peace pursue the quest Of wisdom and the finding out of truth, That there be no more discord upon earth, But only knowledge, beauty, and good will."" "
1091,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And it was done according to Akbar's word. There in the wilderness as by magic rose Futtehpur Sikri, the victorious city, Of marble and red sandstone among the trees, A rose unfolding in the kindling dawn. Palace and mosque and garden and serai, Bazaars and baths and spacious pleasure grounds, By favor of Allah to perfection sprang. "
1092,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Thus Akbar wrought to make his dream come true. From the four corners of the world he brought His master workmen, from Iran and Ind, From wild Mongolia and the Arabian wastes; Masons from Bagdad, Delhi, and Multan; Dome builders from the North, from Samarkand; Cunning mosaic workers from Kanauj; And carvers of inscriptions from Shiraz; And they all labored with endearing skill, Each at his handicraft, to make beauty be. "
1093,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"When the first ax-blade on the timber rang, The timid doves, as if foreboding ill, Had fled from Sikri and its quiet groves. "
1094,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"But as he promised, Akbar sent and bade The wise men of all nations to his court, Brahman and Christian, Buddhist and Parsee, Jain and stiff Mohammedan and Jew, All followers of the One with many names, Bringing the ghostly wisdom of the earth. "
1095,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And so they came of every hue and creed. From the twelve winds of heaven their caravans Drew into Sikri as Akbar summoned them, To spend long afternoons in council grave, Sifting tradition for the seed of truth, In the great mosque in Futtehpur at peace. And Salim Chisti lived his holy life, Beloved and honored there as Akbar's friend. "
1096,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"But light and changeable are the hearts of men. Soon in that city dedicate to peace Dissensions spread and rivalries grew rife, Envy and bitterness and strife returned Once more, and truth before them fled away. Then Salim Chisti, coming to Akbar spoke, ""Lord, give thy servant leave now to depart And follow where the fluttered wings have gone, For here there is no longer any peace, And truth cannot prevail where discord dwells."" "
1097,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"""Nay then,"" said Akbar, ""'tis not thou but I Who am the servant here and must go hence. I found thee master of this solitude, Lord of the princedom of a quiet mind, A sovereign vested in tranquillity, And I have done thee wrong and stayed thy feet From following perfection, with my horde Of turbulent malcontents; and my loved dream To build a city of abiding peace Was but a vain illusion.  Therefore now This foolish people shall be driven forth From this fair place, to live as they may choose In disputance and wrangling longer still, Until they learn, if Allah wills it so, To lay aside their folly for the truth."" "
1098,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"And as the king commanded, so it was. More quickly than he came, with all his court And hosts of followers he went away, Leaving the place to solitude once more,-- A rose to wither where it once had blown. "
1099,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"To-day the all-kind unpolluted sun Shines through the marble fret-work with no sound; The winds play hide and seek through corridors Where stately women with dark glowing eyes Have laughed and frolicked in their fluttering robes; The rose leaves drop with none to gather them, In gardens where no footfall comes with eve, Nor any lovers watch the rising moon; And ancient silence, truer than all speech, Still holds the secrets of the Council Hall, Upon whose walls frescoes of many faiths Attest the courtesy of open minds. "
1100,(A LITTLE BOY'S CHRISTMAS LESSON),"Before the last camp-follower was gone, The doves returned and took up their abode In the main gate of those deserted walls. And in their custody this ""Gate of Peace"" Bears still the grandeur of its origin, Firing anew the wistful hearts of men To brave endeavor with replenished hope, Though since that time three hundred years ago, The magic hush of those forsaken streets And empty courtyards has been undisturbed Save by the gentle whirring of grey wings, With cooing murmurs uttered all day long, And reverent tread of those from near and far, Who still pursue the immemorial quest.
