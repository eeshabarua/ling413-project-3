90,I.,I.
91,I.,
92,I.,
93,I.,"At the extremity of the roadstead of Brest, in the open space that lies"
94,I.,"stretched out between the Ile Longue and Point Kelerne, may be seen two"
95,I.,"rocks crowned with massive granite buildings, and standing boldly up. On"
96,I.,"the former, the lazaretto of Trébéron has been established; the latter,"
97,I.,which in other days was used as a burial-ground and thence took its name
98,I.,"of the Ile des Morts, now contains the principal powder-magazine of the"
99,I.,"naval arsenal. The two rocks separated by an arm of the sea, are about"
100,I.,six miles distant from Brest. In appearance these little islands are not
101,I.,"unlike. Beyond the ground occupied by the buildings upon them, they"
102,I.,"offer nothing to the eye save a succession of stony slopes, dotted here"
103,I.,and there with coarse moss and prickly thorn-broom. Vainly there might
104,I.,you look for any other shelter than that afforded by the fissures of the
105,I.,"rocks, for any other shade than that of the walls, for any other walk"
106,I.,than the short terrace contrived in front of the buildings. Naked and
107,I.,"sterile, the two isles remind you of a couple of immense sentry-boxes"
108,I.,"in stone, placed there for the purpose of keeping guard over the sea,"
109,I.,which is roaring beneath them. But if the foot that treads them remains
110,I.,"imprisoned within a narrow circle, the view from their summit extends"
111,I.,"over an infinite space. Here, you have the bay of Lanvoc, bordered by a"
112,I.,"dull-looking and stunted vegetation; there, Roscanvel with its shadows"
113,I.,"crossed by the graceful spire of its church; there, Spanish Point"
114,I.,"bristling with batteries; and lastly, close upon the horizon lies Brest,"
115,I.,"with its dock-yards, its forts, and the hundred masts of its ships,"
116,I.,"visible through a veil of mist. Midway opens out the Goulet, the harbour"
117,I.,"of this marvellous lake, through which arrive and depart unceasingly"
118,I.,"those wandering sails, that issue forth to flaunt the ensign of France"
119,I.,"upon the waters, or to bring it home again from far-away lands."
120,I.,
121,I.,"A cannon-shot, the echo of which was still booming along the shores, had"
122,I.,"just announced one of these arrivals, and a frigate, with a light"
123,I.,"breeze, was doubling the Point under a cloud of canvas. From the"
124,I.,"esplanade of Trébéron a man, wrapped in a pilot-cloth cape and wearing a"
125,I.,"narrow-brimmed glazed hat, under which it might be seen that his locks"
126,I.,"were turning grey, was looking at the noble vessel as she glided along"
127,I.,"in the distance, between the azure of the sea and of the sky. It was"
128,I.,obvious that the keeper of the lazaretto (for he it was) gave but casual
129,I.,"attention to the sight, with which his long residence at Trébéron had"
130,I.,"familiarized him. His look, for a moment resting carelessly upon the"
131,I.,"frigate which had begun to brail up her upper sails, soon reverted to"
132,I.,"his more immediate neighbourhood, and settled itself at the foot of the"
133,I.,"pathway, that led from the esplanade to the sea, upon a group which"
134,I.,appeared more decidedly to interest him. And in truth the object of this
135,I.,rivetted gaze was of that sort which might have attracted the least
136,I.,attentive eye. A pupil of Phidias would have traced in it the germ of
137,I.,"one of those antique bas-reliefs, of which the marble has become more"
138,I.,precious than gold.
139,I.,
140,I.,Two little girls and a goat were coming up the winding path together.
141,I.,"The elder of the two, who might be eleven years old, was holding the"
142,I.,freakish animal by one of those long pieces of sea-weed that resemble
143,I.,strips of Spanish leather. Her black hair fell down upon a neck
144,I.,"embrowned like a raven's wing, and threw something of a wild hardihood"
145,I.,"into her expression, tempered however by the velvety softness of her"
146,I.,"eye. The younger, seated on the goat as though it were her customary"
147,I.,"place, was of such rosy-white complexion as you see in the flower of the"
148,I.,"eglantine. A tuft of broom, mingling with her golden hair, fell down"
149,I.,"upon her shoulder, and gave her an indescribably coquettish grace. The"
150,I.,"two sisters compelled the goat, which submitted most unwillingly, to"
151,I.,"moderate its pace; but still, as they proceeded, they were obliged to"
152,I.,"double the slender reins by which they kept it within bounds, and anon"
153,I.,to catch hold of the wreath of sea-flowers twisted about its horns.
154,I.,"Then what joyous shouts and peals of laughter were there without end,"
155,I.,broken in upon by the gentle bleatings of _Brunette_ as she pawed the
156,I.,"ground with her foot, and shook her saucy little head! Any other hands"
157,I.,but those of Josèphe and Francine would have tried in vain to make her
158,I.,even so far submissive; but for the latter the goat had been a
159,I.,"foster-mother, a circumstance evidently not forgotten."
160,I.,
161,I.,Mathieu Ropars had been watching for some time this pleasant little
162,I.,"contest between the fantastic _Brunette_ and his daughters, when he felt"
163,I.,"a hand laid upon his arm; he turned round and encountered, so to say,"
164,I.,close against his shoulder the bronzed and smiling face of their mother.
165,I.,
166,I.,"--""Just look at those children,"" said he, nodding his head in the"
167,I.,direction of the merry group.
168,I.,
169,I.,"--""Heavens! Francine will fall,"" exclaimed the mother, stepping towards"
170,I.,the path. He drew her back.
171,I.,
172,I.,"--""Let them be,"" said he; ""don't you know that there is nothing to fear"
173,I.,"when Josèphe has her eye upon them? Besides, _Brunette_ loves them"
174,I.,better than her own kids; nor are they behind-hand in returning it.
175,I.,"Heaven forgive me, if that creature isn't what they think most of--after"
176,I.,"us!"""
177,I.,
178,I.,"--""And after Monsieur Gabriel,"" chimed in their mother--""at least so far"
179,I.,as Josèphe is concerned; for although he scarcely stayed more than a
180,I.,"week in the lazaretto, and that's three years ago, the child never lets"
181,I.,"a day pass by without speaking of him."""
182,I.,
183,I.,"--""To tell the truth, the Lieutenant is a sort of man not easily to be"
184,I.,"forgotten,"" replied Ropars, ""especially by the little one yonder, to"
185,I.,"whom he was so kind and made so many promises. Why, wasn't he to bring"
186,I.,"her all manner of wonderful things from the East? And by the bye, if"
187,I.,"nothing has happened to him, I believe that we shall pretty soon see him"
188,I.,"again, as well as the _Thetis_."""
189,I.,
190,I.,"--""In the meantime I must tell the children of another visit, which will"
191,I.,"also be no small treat for them."""
192,I.,
193,I.,"--""Whose?"""
194,I.,
195,I.,"--""Cousin's, and little Michael's."""
196,I.,
197,I.,"--""Dorot's coming?"" inquired Mathieu, looking towards the platform of"
198,I.,"the Ile des Morts. ""How do you know?"""
199,I.,
200,I.,"--""Can't we talk by signal just as well as his Majesty's ships?"" said"
201,I.,"Geneviève laughing. ""Look, he has hung out of his window three small red"
202,I.,"handkerchiefs; that's to tell us that he's coming over. Besides, I saw"
203,I.,"Michael going down to the Superintendent's."""
204,I.,
205,I.,"--""Bravo!"" cried Ropars, his face lighting up; ""your cousin and the boy"
206,I.,"must sup with us--that is to say, if your pantry is not quite so empty"
207,I.,"as your hospital."""
208,I.,
209,I.,"Geneviève protested, and then enumerated with an air of complacency all"
210,I.,"her culinary resources, which had fortunately been replenished, two"
211,I.,"days before, by the Superintendent, who supplied at the same time the"
212,I.,powder-magazine and the lazaretto. Mathieu promised to complete the
213,I.,feast by broaching for the artillery-man an old bottle of Rousillon
214,I.,"wine, stowed away for a long time under the sand of his cellar."
215,I.,
216,I.,The two little girls at this moment came up on to the terrace.
217,I.,
218,I.,"--""Quick, here!"" cried Geneviève, ""quick; there's somebody coming."""
219,I.,
220,I.,"--""Monsieur Gabriel?"" asked Josèphe, springing forward with this"
221,I.,exclamation.
222,I.,
223,I.,"--""No, no, goose-cap--cousin Dorot and little Michael."""
224,I.,
225,I.,An involuntary gesture of disappointment escaped from the child; but
226,I.,"Francine clapped her hands and broke out into shouts of joy. The goat,"
227,I.,"left to herself, bounded along the precipitous slopes of the rocks,"
228,I.,where she set to work browsing on the tufts of brackish herbage; the
229,I.,sisters took each other's hand to go down towards the little
230,I.,landing-place; whilst their mother went into the house with a view of
231,I.,getting everything in readiness.
232,I.,
233,I.,"As had been remarked by the last-named, the special affection of Josèphe"
234,I.,for Monsieur Gabriel was already of several years standing. It dated
235,I.,"from a quarantine performed at Trébéron by the Lieutenant, who, charmed"
236,I.,"by her grace, bordering though it was upon the savage, had exhibited"
237,I.,"towards her a marked regard, to which the child had responded with what"
238,I.,amounted almost to a passion. Having entered the navy against his
239,I.,"inclination, Monsieur Gabriel had adopted little of it but its uniform."
240,I.,"In the midst of a life of change, hardship, and adventure, he dreamed"
241,I.,"unceasingly of the unchangeableness of the domestic hearth, and of"
242,I.,"peaceful family enjoyments. He was one of those lovers of solitude, who"
243,I.,"are born to live amongst labourers, and women, and children. Confined to"
244,I.,"the lazaretto of Trébéron, he had brought thither a few favourite books,"
245,I.,"and his violin, on which he played for hours at a time, with no other"
246,I.,"end than the listening to its melodious vibrations. When he went out,"
247,I.,"Josèphe ran to meet him, acted as his guide along the rocks, and"
248,I.,"escorted him to their most secluded recesses, in which, day by day, he"
249,I.,"discovered some unknown plant, or moss that was new to him. In the"
250,I.,"evening, be paid a visit to the old quarter-master whose quiet enjoyment"
251,I.,of life had attracted his notice. Geneviève talked to him of her
252,I.,children; Josèphe begged of him a story or a song; and when it was time
253,I.,"for him to retire for the night, he went back to his cell, light hearted"
254,I.,and with tranquil mind. A fortnight thus slipped away as if it had been
255,I.,"an hour; so that when his quarantine was at length performed, and it was"
256,I.,"necessary for him to leave Trébéron, his deliverance did but awaken in"
257,I.,him a feeling of regret. He came back several times to pass whole days
258,I.,upon the lonely islet; and when finally he was embarking for a distant
259,I.,"voyage of discovery, he promised the solitary family that he would"
260,I.,occasionally write to them. Ropars had in fact received some letters
261,I.,"from him; and, as we have seen, was expecting his speedy return. For the"
262,I.,"moment, the visit announced by Geneviève exclusively occupied the keeper"
263,I.,"of the lazaretto. He remained alone upon the esplanade, whence he"
264,I.,continued to look towards the Ile des Morts. The distance rendered
265,I.,visible everything done there; it was easy to recognize persons and to
266,I.,distinguish their movements. He could therefore see Dorot take his way
267,I.,"towards the skiff, set up the mast, and hoist the sail; and the little"
268,I.,"Michael catching hold, with some difficulty, of the tiller."
269,I.,
270,I.,"Previously to the two families becoming allied by marriage, the keepers"
271,I.,of the powder-magazine and of the lazaretto had known each other in the
272,I.,"navy, wherein one was a quarter-master and the other a sergeant of"
273,I.,"artillery. Appointed to Trébéron, Mathieu Ropars had rejoiced at the"
274,I.,"idea of meeting his old ship-mate Dorot, already several years"
275,I.,"established at the Ile des Morts, with his wife, his son, and a female"
276,I.,"orphan relative. The lazaretto being almost always deserted, he was left"
277,I.,"with ample leisure for frequent visits to the powder-magazine, and for"
278,I.,"becoming well known there and thoroughly appreciated. Geneviève, Dorot's"
279,I.,"cousin, was particularly taken with such a character, so"
280,I.,"straight-forward and yet so gentle. She had been tried, until she was"
281,I.,"sixteen, by all the pains and penalties of misery. Taken then, from"
282,I.,"charitable motives, into the house of her cousin whose wife occasionally"
283,I.,"made her pay dearly enough for his hospitality, the poor orphan had"
284,I.,"accustomed herself to expecting nothing at any one's hands, and to"
285,I.,receiving as a favour whatever was accorded her. Thus the frank
286,I.,cordiality of Mathieu was more touching in her eyes than it would have
287,I.,"been in those of another. She welcomed it with a gratitude half filial,"
288,I.,"to which insensibly became added that shade of a more tender feeling,"
289,I.,always blended into the attachments of a woman whose heart is
290,I.,"disengaged. An intimacy between herself and Ropars went on,"
291,I.,"strengthening from day to day, whilst neither of them took account of"
292,I.,their predilections. As he marked the young girl in the bloom of her
293,I.,"expanding beauty, Mathieu, who already felt the weight of years upon"
294,I.,"him, would never have dreamed of asking her to share his existence;"
295,I.,"whilst Geneviève, happy in seeing him daily and in the consciousness of"
296,I.,"his immediate neighbourhood, thought not of desiring anything further."
297,I.,"It needed the offer of a situation for her at Brest, and the consequent"
298,I.,"prospect of a separation, to enlighten them as to their mutual"
299,I.,"dependence on each other. Perceiving that Geneviève shed tears, Ropars,"
300,I.,"who could not shut his eyes to his own distress of mind, took courage"
301,I.,and brought matters to a point. He told her that she might dispense with
302,I.,"this separation, if the isle of Trébéron were no more irksome to her"
303,I.,"than the Ile des Morts, and if his society were as agreeable to her as"
304,I.,"that of her cousin. The poor girl, weeping, blushing and overjoyed,"
305,I.,could only reply by letting herself fall into his arms. The old
306,I.,quarter-master forthwith opened his mind to Dorot. The marriage took
307,I.,"place; and he carried off Geneviève to his islet, of which henceforth"
308,I.,he mistrusted not the solitude.
309,I.,
310,I.,The difference in their respective ages did not seem to mar the
311,I.,happiness of the keeper and the orphan girl. Both were possessed of that
312,I.,which renders marriage a blessing--the simple mind and the heart of
313,I.,"kindly impulse. Children came, to draw still closer these ties, and to"
314,I.,"enliven their hearth. The younger was just born, when Dorot lost his"
315,I.,"wife, and was left alone with his son Michael, thirteen years of age."
316,I.,This premature widowerhood had revived the friendship of the two old
317,I.,shipmates. Their intercourse became more frequent. The skiff that served
318,I.,both establishments was stationed at the little haven of the Ile des
319,I.,"Morts, and was thus at the disposition of the artillery-man, who missed"
320,I.,no opportunity of coming to pass a few hours with his neighbours. But
321,I.,"notwithstanding their proximity, and the ease with which the passage was"
322,I.,"made, these visits could not be of daily occurrence. Dorot was obliged"
323,I.,to be constantly on the watch; his official orders were equally sudden
324,I.,and unforeseen; nor could he expose himself to the risk of too frequent
325,I.,absence. His appearance therefore at the lazaretto had not ceased to be
326,I.,"a happy exception to the rule. Father, mother, and children alike found"
327,I.,in it a festal occasion; and it was never without great rejoicing that
328,I.,"the signal was observed announcing the agreeable visit, and the boat"
329,I.,seen putting out from the little landing-place and stretching over
330,I.,towards Trébéron.
331,I.,
332,I.,"This time, so soon as Ropars saw her on the way, he went down to meet"
333,I.,"her. Scarcely had she touched the ground, when Michael jumped ashore,"
334,I.,"threw his arms about the keeper, then about the two little girls, and"
335,I.,then ran off with the latter towards the house. Dorot stepping out in
336,I.,"turn, shook hands heartily with Mathieu; and the pair, chatting, slowly"
337,I.,"began the ascent. Having reached the summit of the cliff, they faced"
338,I.,"about by force of habit, to take a look out to sea. The artillery-man"
339,I.,remarked that the frigate had just clewed up her lower sails.
340,I.,
341,I.,"--""God help us! she's going to anchor,"" said he; ""did you ever see,"
342,I.,"Mathieu, a homeward-bound ship let go so far from land?"""
343,I.,
344,I.,"--""That depends,"" replied the old quarter-master; ""we hold off when we"
345,I.,"mistrust a fort, or are afraid of reefs."""
346,I.,
347,I.,"--""But there's nothing of that sort here,"" remarked Dorot; ""the frigate"
348,I.,has no need to fear the guns of the Castle which are her very good
349,I.,"friends, or the roadstead which is as safe an anchorage as if she were"
350,I.,"fast in the dry-dock. There must be something extraordinary."""
351,I.,
352,I.,"--""Perhaps the ship has to perform quarantine,"" suggested Ropars; ""the"
353,I.,"_Thetis_ is expected."""
354,I.,
355,I.,"--""That's it; you've named her,"" cried the artillery-man, winking his"
356,I.,eye and shading his forehead with one hand so as to look more fixedly at
357,I.,"the distant vessel; ""it is the _Thetis_, or I'm a heathen. I had her"
358,I.,"down yonder for a week, when she took her powder on board; I know her"
359,I.,"by the set of her masts and by her bearing on the water."""
360,I.,
361,I.,"--""The _Thetis_!"" echoed Mathieu; ""then we shall soon see Monsieur"
362,I.,"Gabriel. What delight for Josèphe! Quick; let's tell her."""
363,I.,
364,I.,"He was hurrying off, but Dorot kept him back. ""No hurry,"" said he;"
365,I.,"""never reckon too surely on what a ship brings home. Pick people out,"
366,I.,and they're just those that are missing when the roll's called. Better
367,I.,"wait till the Lieutenant brings his own news."""
368,I.,
369,I.,"--""You're right,"" replied the quarter-master; ""the more so since the"
370,I.,"frigate comes, if I don't mistake, from the Havannah."""
371,I.,
372,I.,"--""Who knows whether she won't bring you some lodgers for your"
373,I.,"lazaretto?"""
374,I.,
375,I.,"--""So be it; they'll be welcome. With Geneviève and the children, one"
376,I.,can't be dull; but once in a while there's no harm in a little company.
377,I.,"You fellows at the Ile des Morts, you have the artillery"
378,I.,"despatch-carrier, who keeps you up to all that goes on, to say nothing"
379,I.,of inspections and your convoys of powder; whilst here--never a thing!
380,I.,"Not one visitor in a twelvemonth! At least, if you have to put people"
381,I.,"sometimes into quarantine, you hear what's done on land there, and that"
382,I.,"leaves you some thing to talk about for months."""
383,I.,
384,I.,"The artillery-man shrugged his shoulders--""That's all very well, when"
385,I.,they don't bring disease with them; but the old coasters still talk of a
386,I.,quarantine in which the lazaretto ran short of both earth and rock for
387,I.,"burying the dead, and when the bodies were of necessity thrown into the"
388,I.,"sea with a shot attached to their necks, as in vessels out on a voyage."""
389,I.,
390,I.,"--""Now may Christ spare us such a trial!"" exclaimed Ropars, respectfully"
391,I.,"touching his hat, as he was used to do whenever he pronounced the"
392,I.,"Saviour's name. ""But you're speaking of a long time ago, Dorot; please"
393,I.,"Heaven, we won't see such again. There are no heathen here now; and I"
394,I.,"believe that God's good will will take care of us."""
395,I.,
396,I.,"Dorot nodded his acquiescence. In fact this confidence, springing from a"
397,I.,"simple faith, had up to that time been justified by experience. During"
398,I.,"the thirteen years that the keeper had spent at Trébéron, he had only"
399,I.,"received healthy persons into quarantine, who were complying with a"
400,I.,"formal regulation, and were obliged to make proof of their good health"
401,I.,by undergoing this preventive sequestration. There were indeed rare
402,I.,"exceptions. Like all lazarettos, that of Trébéron remained generally"
403,I.,"unoccupied; and the keeper kept watch there alone, like an ever-living"
404,I.,"sentinel posted in advance of the continent, for the purpose of warding"
405,I.,off contagion.
406,I.,
407,I.,"As they chatted, Dorot and he had reached the house. Geneviève was"
408,I.,"waiting for them at the doorway, surrounded by the three children who"
409,I.,laid hold of and talked to her all at once. After an exchange of their
410,I.,"accustomed friendly greetings, she went in, with the two keepers, whilst"
411,I.,"Michael drew off Francine and Josèphe towards _Brunette_, who was"
412,I.,"waiting for them on a pinnacle of rock, eyeing them and bleating at"
413,I.,"them. The youngster, accustomed to chase his father's sheep upon the"
414,I.,"declivities of the Ile des Morts, endeavored to get at her; but the"
415,I.,"capricious creature sprung from point to point along the precipices,"
416,I.,"letting herself at every moment almost be caught, and at every moment"
417,I.,bounding away from the hand that just could touch her.
418,I.,
419,I.,"Whilst the children kept up this chase, with a thousand calls to one"
420,I.,"another and a thousand peals of laughter, Ropars and Dorot entered the"
421,I.,eating-room in which Geneviève was already laying the cloth. It was a
422,I.,"room of middling size, furnished by the keeper himself at the period of"
423,I.,"his marriage, and ornamented with a few marine engravings. Amongst these"
424,I.,"was particularly distinguished a portrait of Jean Bart, that nautical"
425,I.,"Hercules on whom, as all the world knows, his traditional celebrity has"
426,I.,fastened all manner of superhuman exploits and impossible adventures.
427,I.,
428,I.,"Having made his guest sit down, Mathieu went off to disinter his bottle"
429,I.,"of Rousillon wine; and brought it back all whitened with the sand, and"
430,I.,capped with a green-waxed cork that bespoke its noble birth-place. Dorot
431,I.,"good-temperedly complained of such extravagance, and hinted that he"
432,I.,"could not make his visit a long one, inasmuch as the officer commanding"
433,I.,the post of the Ile des Morts had charged him to bring the skiff back
434,I.,before sunset. Geneviève therefore hurried herself to serve up the
435,I.,"dinner, and called the children to take their places at table."
436,I.,
437,I.,With persons whose entire life was contracted within the narrow limits
438,I.,"of two small islands, the conversation could not be much varied. Mathieu"
439,I.,"talked of his still-lines set between the headlands of Trébéron, and"
440,I.,Dorot of his small cherry-tree. The latter might be regarded as the one
441,I.,"stumbling block of pride, over which the habitual modesty of the worthy"
442,I.,sergeant was sure to trip. No other keeper before his time had succeeded
443,I.,"in securing what he planted, from the sea wind; this was the only tree"
444,I.,that had ever been seen in the two islands; and Lucullus might well have
445,I.,"been less proud of the first cherry-tree that he brought from Persia,"
446,I.,for the purpose of gracing his triumph. Humble as regards everything
447,I.,"else, Dorot drew himself up proudly when there was any question of his"
448,I.,poor wild-stock; he only let it be seen by his friends and his
449,I.,"superiors, and then at their urgent solicitation. Objects resemble human"
450,I.,"kind, and very often assume the importance that is given them, in place"
451,I.,of that to which they are entitled. Thus overcharged and carefully
452,I.,"tended, the fame of the cherry-tree of the Ile des Morts went abroad"
453,I.,from Plougastel to Camaret; it was everywhere talked of as a prodigy.
454,I.,"The pride of Dorot had increased in a corresponding degree, and was just"
455,I.,now swollen to the highest pitch by an event no less extraordinary than
456,I.,"unforseen. He brought the news of it to Trébéron, but would not make it"
457,I.,"known too abruptly. All supposable things were first to be run over, as"
458,I.,in the famous letter of Madame de Sevigné on the marriage of
459,I.,"Mademoiselle. Finally, when every one had given it up, he determined to"
460,I.,"enlighten them, and announced ... that the cherry-tree was in blossom!"
461,I.,
462,I.,Unanimous was the cry of astonishment and delight. Prisoners in their
463,I.,"island, it was several years since Ropars and Geneviève had seen a tree"
464,I.,in blossom; and the two little girls could not recall to mind that they
465,I.,"had ever seen one. Loudly and both at once, they beset Michael with"
466,I.,questions. Was the cherry-tree flowering in gold-colour like the
467,I.,"thorn-broom, or in the colour of blood like the sea-furze? How could the"
468,I.,blossoms ever become fruit? Must they wait a long time? Would the tree
469,I.,"bear the red cherries of the coast, or the black-hearts of the upper"
470,I.,"country? Dorot cut all these inquiries short, by declaring that he would"
471,I.,"come over next day, for the whole of the family, that they might see the"
472,I.,wondrous tree and dine at the Ile des Morts. The ecstacies of the
473,I.,sisters may be imagined. Their mother could not check their laughing and
474,I.,"their clapping of hands. They continued their cry of ""to-morrow,"
475,I.,"to-morrow!"" just as Æneas' look-out men kept up their cry of ""Italy,"
476,I.,"Italy!"" when they saw through the empurpled vapours that goal of so many"
477,I.,efforts and such longings.
478,I.,
479,I.,"Remarking their impatience, the sergeant proposed to carry them over,"
480,I.,"that very evening, with Michael. There would be still day-light enough"
481,I.,"on their arrival, for them to see the cherry-tree covered with its coat"
482,I.,"of summer-snow, and their parents could fetch them, next day. The"
483,I.,"children backed this offer with their entreaties; Ropars smiled,"
484,I.,without replying; but Geneviève entered her protest against it. What
485,I.,"would she do, if Francine and Josèphe were away? Many a time ere this,"
486,I.,"on waking in the middle of the night, she had fretted herself at not"
487,I.,"hearing their gentle breathings; she had jumped up in agony, and had"
488,I.,"crept on tip-toe to their bed, to touch them and to listen to them; how"
489,I.,"would it be then, if they were not there; how could she herself sleep"
490,I.,quietly without fancying some danger? She would dream that the
491,I.,"powder-magazine was on fire, or that the Ile des Morts was going down"
492,I.,like a vessel foundering--and all this was said betwixt a laugh and a
493,I.,"tear. The little maidens, bent at first on setting off, were soon"
494,I.,"hanging on their mother's shoulders, touched by her contagious"
495,I.,"tenderness, and declaring that they preferred to remain. The"
496,I.,artillery-man insisted no longer. He took with Mathieu the path that led
497,I.,"down to the sandy shore, and was followed by Geneviève and the children,"
498,I.,all silent for the moment.
499,I.,
500,I.,"The sun declining to the horizon lit up the promontory of Kelerne, and"
501,I.,painted in the passage of Goulet a stream of purple and gold. A breeze
502,I.,"began to play over the bay, and chequered it with undulating ripples."
503,I.,The perfume exhaled from the saps was wafted in puffs of wind from the
504,I.,"main land, as were the tinklings of the Angelus, and the lowing of the"
505,I.,cattle driven home. A consciousness of strength in repose was
506,I.,"perceivable, together with an indescribable air of serenity, that stole"
507,I.,"from surrounding objects upon the senses, and found its way to the very"
508,I.,"depths of the soul. The sky, the earth, and the water seemed by mutual"
509,I.,"consent to have subdued their voices, in order to mingle them in one"
510,I.,harmonious murmur. Without analyzing the soft but not enervating
511,I.,"influence that surrounded them, the two keepers with their families were"
512,I.,"alive to its effects. Silently they went down the foot-path, pausing"
513,I.,"upon their steps, as though to lengthen out the sense of enjoyment, or"
514,I.,"to taste of it drop by drop. Having, however, reached the boat, it"
515,I.,became necessary to part. Josèphe made the sergeant promise to come for
516,I.,"them early in the morning. The sail at last was hoisted; and the skiff,"
517,I.,"launched out upon the yielding waves, sped her way towards the"
518,I.,powder-magazine.
519,I.,
520,I.,At the moment when she reached the middle of the channel that separates
521,I.,"the two islands, a ship's long-boat, unobserved hitherto in the"
522,I.,"excitement of leave-taking, appeared to leeward of Trébéron. Her"
523,I.,"peculiar build, her black color traversed only by a single white ribbon"
524,I.,"at the water-line, and the perfect condition of her spars and sails,"
525,I.,"would have sufficed to show what she was, even if the costume of the"
526,I.,double row of sailors ranged along the thwarts had not betrayed the
527,I.,"man-of-war's men. On crossing the skiff steered by the sergeant, she was"
528,I.,sheered suddenly off; and by the last glimpse of day-light might be
529,I.,discerned the yellow flag of the Health Office.
530,I.,
531,I.,"At this sight, Geneviève and the children uttered an involuntary cry."
532,I.,All three at once comprehended that these were occupants coming to the
533,I.,"lazaretto; that they would put the island into quarantine, and prevent"
534,I.,all external intercourse. The next day's visit must be indefinitely
535,I.,"postponed, and the cherry-tree would have finished blossoming before"
536,I.,they could have regained their liberty. This dashing down of a
537,I.,newly-raised anticipation had in it something so abrupt and so
538,I.,"unexpected, that Francine and Josèphe could by no means resign"
539,I.,"themselves to it. Desolate was the look that they exchanged, and"
540,I.,"silently did they begin to weep, as their mother took one of them in"
541,I.,"either hand, and sorrowfully remounted the path. Geneviève herself felt"
542,I.,"her heart oppressed; on reaching the platform, she could not but pause"
543,I.,"for a moment. The skiff with rose-coloured sail, that bore away the"
544,I.,"promise of another meeting and of a festival, had disappeared; the black"
545,I.,"long-boat was there at her feet--and with it had come to shore,"
546,I.,"seclusion, melancholy, and disease. Geneviève kissed her children; but"
547,I.,scarcely could she keep back a tear that had gathered beneath her
548,I.,"eyelids, as without the inclination to prolong her look she hastily"
549,I.,entered the house.
550,I.,
551,I.,Mathieu in the meantime had gone to receive the persons placed in
552,I.,"quarantine, and to open the lazaretto for them. On returning, he looked"
553,I.,"somewhat pale, and his face wore an expression with which Geneviève was"
554,I.,"struck; but at the first question she asked him, he abruptly interrupted"
555,I.,"her, to inquire where Francine and Josèphe were."
556,I.,
557,I.,"--""Don't you see them?"" she replied, pointing to the two little girls"
558,I.,"sitting down in a dark corner, still sobbing, and with eyes still moist;"
559,I.,"""did you think that they had gone with their cousin?"""
560,I.,
561,I.,"""Would to God, they had!"" murmured Mathieu in an agonized voice, but not"
562,I.,overheard by the children.
563,I.,
564,I.,"Geneviève looked at him, stupefied. ""Why so?"" she asked; ""what has"
565,I.,"happened? Tell me, Mathieu, in the name of the Holy Trinity! what is the"
566,I.,"matter?"""
567,I.,
568,I.,"--""Well, then,"" answered the keeper, ""there is ... there is ... death"
569,I.,"upon the island."""
570,I.,
571,I.,"--""How do you mean?"""
572,I.,
573,I.,"--""I mean, my poor wife, just what I have seen! The _Thetis's_ long-boat"
574,I.,"has landed her hospital-mates and doctors, with eight sick men; not one"
575,I.,"of whom will ever touch the main-land again."""
576,I.,
577,I.,"--""Holy Virgin! what is it?"""
578,I.,
579,I.,"--""The yellow fever!"""
580,I.,
581,I.,
582,II.,II.
583,II.,
584,II.,
585,II.,"For him who dwells in-land, the yellow fever is but a disease similar to"
586,II.,"a thousand others, of which he knows nothing save the name. Family"
587,II.,"tradition and personal experience can attach to it, for him, neither"
588,II.,"terror or regret. But amongst our maritime population, the word sounds"
589,II.,"like a knell; not only bringing to mind a risk to be encountered, but"
590,II.,"reviving affliction, of recent or of ancient date. There, where every"
591,II.,family has one at least of its loved members absent in foreign
592,II.,"countries, the terrible scourge is all too well identified with the"
593,II.,number of widows and orphans that it has made. It ranks with the storm
594,II.,"and the reef of rocks, as a deadly foe. Its name, let fall, produces the"
595,II.,"same effect as the wind that whistles, or the surf that roars. Looks are"
596,II.,"interchanged on hearing it; and thought recurs to the absent, if not to"
597,II.,the dead.
598,II.,
599,II.,"Ropars, on this occasion, dwelt mainly on those about him; and in truth,"
600,II.,no one could have better right than he to be ill at ease. Thrown in
601,II.,"former days upon a station where the yellow fever was epidemic, he had"
602,II.,"seen the seamen of the fleet decimated around him, and had himself"
603,II.,"barely escaped, as if by miracle. The remembrance of that butchery, as"
604,II.,"he termed it, was too vivid, and he had too often described it to"
605,II.,"Geneviève, for their firmness not now to be shaken. They troubled not"
606,II.,"themselves on their own account, but on account of those whose existence"
607,II.,was so dear to them. Mathieu's first thought was of his wife and of his
608,II.,"children; the first impulse of Geneviève was to fold them in her arms,"
609,II.,and to declare that they must all go away. Some trouble had the old
610,II.,"sailor in making her comprehend that, even if retreating were not"
611,II.,"dishonorable for him, it had become impossible. The long-boat had made"
612,II.,"sail for the frigate, and the yellow flag was hoisted at the lazaretto."
613,II.,Quarantine had begun for all who happened to be at Trébéron. Not a soul
614,II.,could henceforth pass beyond its limits: and Ropars pointed out to
615,II.,"Geneviève the gun-boat sent by the health officer, which had been"
616,II.,"brought to bear at half cable's-length distance from the island, and cut"
617,II.,off from it all intercourse by boats. They were in fact definitively
618,II.,"penned in with the epidemic, and condemned to run its risk to the end."
619,II.,
620,II.,"But the agitation of Mathieu, in which surprise had worked its part, did"
621,II.,not last long. The quarter-master soon regained his original strength of
622,II.,"mind, which had been slightly unhinged in the tendernesses of his"
623,II.,"domestic life; and, regardless of his own previous words, he set himself"
624,II.,seriously to soothing the terror of Geneviève by underrating the danger
625,II.,"that they incurred. After all, they were not here in a state of things"
626,II.,that favoured the disease; they had not to contend against the
627,II.,enervating sun of the Havannah or Brazil; this was not one of those
628,II.,"awful contagions that spread from house to house like a fire, leaving"
629,II.,"behind it the dead alone--it was a disorder partly spent, and from"
630,II.,"which, with certain precautions, escape was easy. The chief and the most"
631,II.,indispensable of these precautions was to avoid going near the
632,II.,"apartments occupied by those who had been brought into quarantine, and"
633,II.,never to stay to leeward of the lazaretto. Josèphe and Francine were at
634,II.,once informed of this. Geneviève explained to them every thing that they
635,II.,"were to do, with a minuteness of detail, that savoured alternately of"
636,II.,"threatening and of endearment. At first, as the punishment for any"
637,II.,"failure of obedience, she pointed out to them the disease, or even death"
638,II.,"itself; then seeing them turn pale with fear, she drew them within her"
639,II.,caressing arms and re-assured them by her kisses. Mathieu added to her
640,II.,"exhortations something more definite and more secure. Next morning, he"
641,II.,"marked out a space enclosed with stakes joined together by a cord, as"
642,II.,"the children's permitted bounds. By way of increased precaution, the"
643,II.,"goat herself was brought within this enclosure, picketted to a stake,"
644,II.,"and fed upon winter fodder. The keeper, on his part, held aloof from"
645,II.,habitual intercourse with the infirmary-men and the doctors of the
646,II.,lazaretto. He would even have been ignorant of the fate of those who
647,II.,"were in quarantine if, every evening, the descent of a few men towards"
648,II.,"the sandy shore of the little isle, and the tinkling of a bell that"
649,II.,"warned him to stand out of their way, had not made it obvious that their"
650,II.,"errand was to dig a grave. The vacancies, besides, were rapidly filled"
651,II.,"by fresh invalids brought on shore by the frigate's long-boat, for the"
652,II.,epidemic did not seem as yet to decrease or to relax its severity. No
653,II.,convalescent inmate had yet appeared upon the terrace of the lazaretto.
654,II.,"The skiff belonging to the gun-boat, that enforced the sanitary"
655,II.,"regulations, came near the landing place every morning; but no one"
656,II.,landed. Provisions and medicines were put ashore by means of a
657,II.,"travelling pass-rope, set up in the creek; the Surgeon's report was"
658,II.,received at the end of a boat-hook; and then the skiff sailed away in an
659,II.,"apparent hurry, that bespoke the fear of contagion."
660,II.,
661,II.,"However, after the first few days were past, Ropars and Geneviève felt"
662,II.,somewhat re-assured. The blows that death dealt around them were mute
663,II.,and hidden; the edge of inquietude became insensibly blunted. Seeing
664,II.,"that it was possible to live in contact with the formidable malady, they"
665,II.,"half forgot, both of them, that is was also possible to die. It was with"
666,II.,"them as with the inhabitants of a besieged city, who no longer tremble"
667,II.,"at the roar of cannon. In vain did the bell tinkle every evening, and"

676,II.,"Ropars had made inquiries for Monsieur Gabriel, on the first arrival of"
677,II.,the sick. The epidemic had not then attacked him; but his own breaking
678,II.,"off from all intercourse with the hospital-mates, and with the crew, had"
679,II.,prevented his seeking further information. Several boat-loads had been
680,II.,"brought ashore, without any opportunity for his hearing of the"
681,II.,"Lieutenant, when he received a note, cut through with scissors and"
682,II.,"steeped in vinegar. It contained only these few words, written in"
683,II.,pencil:

805,"GABRIEL.""","Francine, in dire alarm, had hidden her head upon Josèphe's knees; she,"

808,"GABRIEL.""","laid down the corpse upon the ground, wrapped-up in a coarse linen"

810,"GABRIEL.""","emptied its contents into the grave. The white dust, that rose up from"
811,"GABRIEL.""","it as a cloud, was wafted to the children in a sour odour of lime. This"
812,"GABRIEL.""","was carefully spread over the bottom of the hole, so as to form a bed"
813,"GABRIEL.""","for the dead body, and was then sprinkled with water drawn from the sea."
814,"GABRIEL.""",These preparatory measures had all been taken in gloomy silence. Nought

816,"GABRIEL.""",monotonous bubbling of the tiny waves that rippled with the evening
817,"GABRIEL.""","breeze upon the shore. Josèphe, her neck out-stretched, her large eyes"
818,"GABRIEL.""","dilated, and with a painful sense of tightening at her heart-strings,"
819,"GABRIEL.""",continued on the watch.
820,"GABRIEL.""",
821,"GABRIEL.""","At this moment, two of the bearers took up the body, and brought it"

824,"GABRIEL.""","burden, a gust of wind unrolled one of the corners of the covering"
825,"GABRIEL.""",cloth; a livid head was visible by the last glimmering of light; and
826,"GABRIEL.""",Josèphe uttered a stifled cry. The fall of the body into the pit
827,"GABRIEL.""",prevented her being heard; but the moment's glance had sufficed--the
828,"GABRIEL.""",child thought she recognized the face of Monsieur Gabriel. She threw
829,"GABRIEL.""","herself back, in inexpressible horror. It was the first time that death"
830,"GABRIEL.""","had come before her eyes, and it appeared to her in a guise that filled"
831,"GABRIEL.""","her with grief and terror. Clinging to Francine, she began to tremble in"
832,"GABRIEL.""","every limb. The noise of the earth and flint-stones, that were shovelled"
833,"GABRIEL.""","into the grave, held her as one petrified. It was only when the four"
834,"GABRIEL.""","grave-diggers had left the ravine and disappeared in the pathway, that"
835,"GABRIEL.""",her agony found vent. Francine raised her head and asked what had
836,"GABRIEL.""","happened; but receiving no reply, threw herself into Josèphe's arms, and"
837,"GABRIEL.""",began in turn to sob.

839,"GABRIEL.""","The distress of her little sister seemed to counteract that of Josèphe,"

879,"GABRIEL.""","--""There, stop, Zine!"" said she, with broken voice; ""... we must be calm"

883,"GABRIEL.""",
884,"GABRIEL.""",With these words the two little maidens rose from the ground; quitting

888,"GABRIEL.""","Geneviève was waiting there for them; but it was already dark, and this"

894,III,III
895,III,
896,III,
897,III,"Josèphe slept badly; and the next morning, when she got up, was pale and"
898,III,"drooping. Geneviève, who did not fail to notice it, questioned her with"
899,III,nervous solicitude; but the child answered that nothing was the matter.
900,III,"Only, at every inquiry, her eyes filled with tears, and her voice"
901,III,trembled. Thus languidly for her did the day wear away. In the evening
902,III,"she was still more depressed, but still not suffering pain. She passed a"
903,III,restless night; and on the following morning Ropars went for the Surgeon
904,III,"of the lazaretto. He examined the child, and put several questions that"
905,III,"darkened the brow of Mathieu. Geneviève, whose looks went direct from"
906,III,"the Surgeon to her husband, perceived this; and she felt a blow stricken"
907,III,"upon her heart. At the moment when the two crossed the thresh-hold, she"
908,III,"followed, shut the door abruptly, and stopped them."
909,III,
910,III,"--""It is the ... disease, ... is it not?"" she asked in anguish. She had"
911,III,not dared to name the yellow fever; the Surgeon seemed to hesitate in
912,III,his reply.
913,III,
914,III,"--""Ah! I'm certain of it,"" she exclaimed, confirmed by this very"
915,III,"hesitation; ""so, our precautions have all been useless! The blow has"
916,III,"come, and all is over!"""
917,III,
918,III,"She could not avoid sinking down upon the stone bench, placed beside the"
919,III,door; and she covered her face with her apron. The Surgeon taxed himself
920,III,to console her with vague assurances; but it was evident that he himself
921,III,had no longer confidence in his efforts. Overcome by the implacable
922,III,"power of the contagion, he persevered in struggling against it, without"
923,III,"hope and from a sense of duty, as soldiers, for the honour of their"
924,III,"flag, defend silently a post that has been abandoned. So, perceiving"
925,III,"that his words, far from soothing the grief of Geneviève, did but"
926,III,"redouble it, he turned towards the keeper, and, having briefly repeated"
927,III,"to him some directions already given for the child, he went his way."
928,III,
929,III,"Ropars remained some moments on one spot, with his arms crossed and his"
930,III,head upon his breast; but a still deeper groan from Geneviève caused him
931,III,to raise his eyes. He took her hand.
932,III,
933,III,"--""It isn't time for despair yet,"" said he, with gentle firmness; ""when"
934,III,"God shall have decided against us, your whole life-time will be left for"
935,III,"grief. At present, let us devote ourselves to our duty, and follow"
936,III,"strictly the injunctions of the doctor."""
937,III,
938,III,"--""And he has told us nothing at all!"" said the mother, who at heart"
939,III,"felt half-incensed against the Surgeon, for not having more vigorously"
940,III,"combatted her fears; ""he has not given us any hope!"""
941,III,
942,III,"--""God is the master,"" replied Mathieu, in all simplicity, ""and so long"
943,III,"as he has not declared his pleasure, we may believe that all will work"
944,III,"well; but if the darling creature must be taken from our hands, let us"
945,III,"at least to the last moment show him, how keen is our desire to keep"
946,III,"her."""
947,III,
948,III,Hereupon the feverish voice of the child reached their ears.
949,III,
950,III,"--""Hark, she's calling me!"" cried Geneviève, rising in urgent haste to"
951,III,go in. Ropars stopped her.
952,III,
953,III,"--""Dry your eyes first,"" said he, passing his own hand with fond"
954,III,"compassion over the poor mother's moistened eyelids; ""Josèphe mustn't"
955,III,think that you are anxious. Don't you know that her life may depend on
956,III,"this?"""
957,III,
958,III,"--""Yes, yes,"" she answered, ""fear not, Mathieu, I will not cry any"
959,III,"more;"" and she forcibly restrained the tears that were filling her eyes"
960,III,"afresh... ""Look, no one would notice it now... And the doctors, besides,"
961,III,"may be mistaken, mayn't they?... And after all, God will have pity on"
962,III,"us."""
963,III,
964,III,"--""We must hope so,"" replied the keeper, much moved; ""but if it is his"
965,III,"part to have pity, it is ours to show resignation. Bear up, then, good"
966,III,heart; go to the child with a smile; it will do her good; and first of
967,III,"all ... kiss me ... that we may keep up each other's resolution."""
968,III,
969,III,"Josèphe's mother threw her arms around her husband's neck, and gave way"
970,III,to a new flood of tears. But she checked them at the sound of the sick
971,III,"one's voice calling her for the second time, and, by a supreme effort"
972,III,"thrusting down her despair into the very depths of her heart, she rushed"
973,III,into the house with calm brow and a smile upon her lips.
974,III,
975,III,"Josèphe, nevertheless, grew rapidly worse. In the evening the fever was"
976,III,"doubly hot upon her. One after another, she spoke of sister Francine, of"
977,III,"Michael, of the cherry-tree in blossom, and of her good friend Monsieur"
978,III,Gabriel. At one moment she fancied that she heard the last-named; she
979,III,called him; she wished to know if he had brought her the promised
980,III,"presents. At another time, the scene in the ravine appeared to be"
981,III,vividly in her recollection; she cried out that Monsieur Gabriel was
982,III,dead; and she heard the earth grating over him in the pit. The Surgeon
983,III,"came to see her repeatedly, and multiplied his prescriptions, without"
984,III,power to arrest the onward march of the disease. That night was an awful
985,III,"one for the hapless mother; she kept her child clasped in her arms, the"
986,III,little one's mind wandering more and more. At sunrise the turbulent
987,III,"delirium was over, to give place to the torpor that precedes death. At"
988,III,"length, towards the middle of the day, Josèphe opened her eyes, and"
989,III,uttered one sigh--it was the last.
990,III,
991,III,"The blow had been so decidedly expected, that the despair of Ropars and"
992,III,of Geneviève could scarcely be violent. The bitterness of their loss
993,III,"had, so to say, preceded it; both had tasted it, drop by drop, during"
994,III,the protracted agony. And yet the mother's calmness had in it a
995,III,"something haggard, that would have startled a looker-on less troubled"
996,III,than Mathieu himself. Bent upon rendering the last offices to her
997,III,"daughter, she was long occupied in combing out her beautiful black hair;"
998,III,"she dressed the body in her best clothes, and laid it out with the hands"
999,III,"crossed over the breast, as Josèphe had been used to carry them when"
1000,III,"asleep. All this was done slowly, tranquilly, with a sort of complacency"
1001,III,"even, and often intermingled with kisses. It was but at intervals that a"
1002,III,"tear trickled over her cheeks, that were marbled with glowing spots; it"
1003,III,"was but a slight trembling that shook the hand, as it performed its"
1004,III,"sorrowful duty. At length, when she who had brought this child into the"
1005,III,"world, and who had nourished it with her milk and with her affection,"
1006,III,"had herself sewed it up in its shroud, she went to the window, broke the"
1007,III,stalk of a gilly-flower--the only one that the sea-winds had
1008,III,"spared--pulled off its leaves, and scattered them over the winding"
1009,III,sheet.
1010,III,
1011,III,"In the meantime, night had fallen. Deposited at the head of the darkened"
1012,III,"alcove, the dead form might indistinctly be traced through its covering"
1013,III,"of linen, as though it were sketched in marble. Higher up hung a Christ,"
1014,III,"in ivory, the head bent forward, and the arms extended. Geneviève knelt"
1015,III,"down near the bed, and remained there for a long time, with her head"
1016,III,leaning upon her joined hands. Half-aloud she murmured a prayer; but
1017,III,"whilst her lips repeated faithfully every word, their meaning was not"
1018,III,"taken in by her mind. When she had finished it, she raised herself up"
1019,III,"mechanically, and looked about her; her brain was a gloomy chaos."
1020,III,"Putting up both hands to her forehead, she pressed it, with a stifled"
1021,III,"cry, as though she sought to stay that whirlwind of confused and"
1022,III,"lacerating thoughts. There was, for some few moments, a struggle between"
1023,III,her will and her despair; finally the former gained the ascendant; she
1024,III,stepped towards the door and opened it.
1025,III,
1026,III,"Her husband had taken refuge on the platform with Francine, to remove"
1027,III,her from the harrowing sight of placing the body in its shroud.
1028,III,Geneviève could see him standing near the parapet; the little girl was
1029,III,"at his feet, with her head resting on his knees. Since the death of her"
1030,III,"sister, she had not spoken a word. Fixed in one place, with eyes dilated"
1031,III,"and lips compressed, she seemed to be endeavouring to comprehend what"
1032,III,"had occurred. Her two small hands hung down inactive, and her naked feet"
1033,III,"appeared to be glued to the ground. Seeing her thus, under the early"
1034,III,"rays of the moon that were playing in her light-coloured tresses,"
1035,III,"Geneviève was, as it were, brought back to herself. A flash passed"
1036,III,across the blankness of her expression; her nostrils dilated; a flood of
1037,III,"tears gushed from her eyes. Springing towards the child, she seized it"
1038,III,"in her arms with a sort of doleful passionateness, to which Francine at"
1039,III,"once and amply responded, by an outburst of sobs and caresses. For a"
1040,III,long time there was nothing but an interchange of broken appeals and
1041,III,"unfinished phrases. The little girl would go on asking for her sister,"
1042,III,"while the mother, whose despair was revived by such demands, compelled"
1043,III,"herself to smother them beneath her kisses. At last, her strength"
1044,III,"exhausted, she let her arms, that upheld Francine, drop down, and felt"
1045,III,"that she was gently withdrawn from her. It was Mathieu, who placed the"
1046,III,"child upon the ground. He then led the mother a little further apart,"
1047,III,"and obliged her to sit down upon the stone-bench, leaning her back"
1048,III,"against the parapet. She tried to raise herself up, as she stretched out"
1049,III,her hands.
1050,III,
1051,III,"--""My child!"" she stammered through her sobbings; ""I want my child!"""
1052,III,
1053,III,"--""In good time thou shalt see her,"" said Ropars, who according to the"
1054,III,"custom of the Bretagne peasantry only _thee'd_ and _thou'd_ Geneviève,"
1055,III,"when under the influence of strong emotion; ""but first thou must listen"
1056,III,"with all attention, for what I have to tell thee is of the deepest"
1057,III,"consequence."""
1058,III,
1059,III,"--""Ah! I would, I would!"" was her reply, putting both hands up to her"
1060,III,"head; ""but don't be hurt, Mathieu, if it be impossible. I hear yonder,"
1061,III,"look you, something that hushes up all the rest; it is her death-rattle,"
1062,III,my good man!... And ... do you know?... I like the anguish that it
1063,III,"causes me, to hear it; I can fancy that there still is breath in her."
1064,III,"Oh! Jesus! who would have told me, that I should yearn after the dying"
1065,III,"breath of my child?"" Ropars laid a hand upon the head of the miserable"
1066,III,"woman, whose sobbings had recommenced."
1067,III,
1068,III,"--""Be soothed at heart,"" he said to her with touching firmness; ""the"
1069,III,"good God wills that we should submit, and not thus give way. The dead"
1070,III,"one is now in her Paradise, where she has no more need of us; but she"
1071,III,"leaves behind her a sister, whose life is in our charge."""
1072,III,
1073,III,"--""How do you mean?"" asked Geneviève, raising towards him her eyes, in"
1074,III,which alarm had arrested the tears.
1075,III,
1076,III,"--""Don't you understand?"" returned the keeper, lowering his voice; ""the"
1077,III,breath of the disease is like the sea-wind; it spares no one; and it may
1078,III,"send, at any instant, the living to rejoin the dead."""
1079,III,
1080,III,"--""Heavenly Saviour! is this a warning?"" demanded Geneviève, clasping"
1081,III,"her hands. ""Must this child too, be struck down?... Have you remarked"
1082,III,"any thing?... Ah! tell the truth, Mathieu, tell it at once; I would"
1083,III,"rather be killed at one blow."""
1084,III,
1085,III,"--""So far, the child suffers from nothing but her distress,"" rejoined"
1086,III,"Ropars; ""but if she remains in this deadly air, who can guarantee us"
1087,III,"that she will escape?"""
1088,III,
1089,III,"--""Evil upon us!"" cried Geneviève, raising her joined hands over her"
1090,III,"head; ""why did you remind me of it, Mathieu? I did not wish to think of"
1091,III,"it; and now I shall see her dying, every hour. God forgive you for thus"
1092,III,"turning the blade that is within my heart!"""
1093,III,
1094,III,"--""If I touch it, it is but to withdraw it,"" was the quarter-master's"
1095,III,"answer. ""It won't do now to shut one's eyes and let the squall overtake"
1096,III,us; we must work ship with all our might for the little one's safety....
1097,III,"If she remains on the island, you have too many chances of sewing up her"
1098,III,"winding-sheet, Geneviève; she must leave it forthwith."""
1099,III,
1100,III,"--""But how?"""
1101,III,
1102,III,"Ropars threw his eyes around him, to satisfy himself that he was not"
1103,III,overheard.
1104,III,
1105,III,"--""There is a way,"" he replied cautiously."
1106,III,
1107,III,"--""The powder-magazine skiff?"""
1108,III,
1109,III,"--""No!"""
1110,III,
1111,III,"--""The gun-boat?"""
1112,III,
1113,III,"--""She's there, you know, to keep guard over the island."""
1114,III,
1115,III,"--""But who then can help us?"""
1116,III,
1117,III,"--""The tide."""
1118,III,
1119,III,"Geneviève looked at her husband, but without understanding what he"
1120,III,meant.
1121,III,
1122,III,"--""It is now high-water,"" continued Mathieu; ""in less than an hour the"
1123,III,sea will have gone down enough to leave only four feet of water upon the
1124,III,line of reefs that runs from Trébéron to the Ile des Morts. With
1125,III,"courage, and by the help of God, the passage may be tried. I am going to"
1126,III,"carry the child over to Dorot."""
1127,III,
1128,III,"And as the mother could not restrain a cry of terror;--""Speak lower,"
1129,III,"unhappy one!"" he added vehemently; ""are you desirous of betraying me?"
1130,III,"Except the Superintendent of the powder-magazine and myself, no one"
1131,III,knows the way. We have often passed along it when we were fishing
1132,III,"together, and always passed it safely."""
1133,III,
1134,III,"--""But not at night,"" interrupted Geneviève; ""not burdened with a"
1135,III,"child."""
1136,III,
1137,III,"--""The child weighs scarcely anything, and the moon is full,"" replied"
1138,III,"Ropars somewhat impatiently. ""Besides, I have been thinking of it all"
1139,III,"the evening; and there is no other means. My mind is made up, and I"
1140,III,"shall do what must be done, happen what may. Your remarks may lessen my"
1141,III,"confidence, but cannot hold me back. Try rather, then, to brace up my"
1142,III,"nerves, as is the duty of a brave wife, and to prepare the child to go."
1143,III,"When the outer point of the high rock is bare, it will be time for me to"
1144,III,"make the attempt, and for you to pray God that he may open us a way of"
1145,III,"safety in the sea."""
1146,III,
1147,III,"The quarter-master's tone was so determined, that Geneviève saw at once"
1148,III,the uselessness of resistance. With little will of his own in the
1149,III,"ordinary transactions of life, Mathieu rarely formed a resolution; but,"
1150,III,"once decided on, he maintained it immovably. Moreover, when the first"
1151,III,"shock was passed, his explanations and assurances somewhat tranquillized"
1152,III,"Francine's mother, and indeed half convinced her. There remained the"
1153,III,"child, whose opposition or fright was apprehended by Ropars. Geneviève"
1154,III,"went and raised her up from the ground, and the father and the mother"
1155,III,"seated her upon their knees, which they purposely placed close"
1156,III,together.
1157,III,
1158,III,"--""You want to see the cherry-tree in blossom, don't you?"" said the"
1159,III,"former, embracing her."
1160,III,
1161,III,"--""Not any more, now,"" was the low-toned reply."
1162,III,
1163,III,"--""Nay, nay, it is just the time,"" added the poor mother with an effort;"
1164,III,"""over there, you will be more at liberty ... happier ... you'll have"
1165,III,"Michael for a play-fellow."""
1166,III,
1167,III,"--""No,"" said the child with changing voice, ""I would rather stay with"
1168,III,"Josèphe."""
1169,III,
1170,III,Geneviève clasped her hands and closed her eyes; speech failed her. It
1171,III,"was Ropars' turn. Drawing Francine close up to his breast, and"
1172,III,"whispering in her ear,"
1173,III,
1174,III,"--""Listen,"" said he; ""we are in trouble. You would not wish to make it"
1175,III,"worse, would you? You love us too well for that."""
1176,III,
1177,III,"In place of answer, the child threw both her arms about her father's"
1178,III,"neck, and pressed her little rosy cheek against the wrinkled cheek of"
1179,III,the mariner.
1180,III,
1181,III,"--""Yes, yes, I was certain of it,"" continued Mathieu; ""and you will do"
1182,III,"whatever we ask you?"""
1183,III,
1184,III,Francine made an affirmative sign.
1185,III,
1186,III,"--""Well, then,"" Ropars went on, ""you must go and pass a few days with"
1187,III,"Uncle Dorot; and as we have no boat, I am going to carry you over the"
1188,III,"passage. Won't you be quiet in the middle of the sea, when you have"
1189,III,"papa's shoulders for a skiff?"""
1190,III,
1191,III,"The child shuddered.--""I would rather stay,"" said she, in hurried"
1192,III,accents.
1193,III,
1194,III,"--""But that's impossible,"" rejoined the father; ""I want to carry you to"
1195,III,"the powder-magazine. It must be so, and we are to set out directly. But"
1196,III,"if you are not brave, if you think of calling out, the way will be"
1197,III,"harder, and perhaps something serious may happen to me. Do you"
1198,III,"understand?"""
1199,III,
1200,III,"--""Yes ... yes ... I won't go,"" replied the little girl, beginning to"
1201,III,tremble.
1202,III,
1203,III,"Geneviève drew her once more into her arms. ""Hush, hush!"" said she,"
1204,III,"laying her lips upon Francine's hair, and rocking her upon her breast,"
1205,III,"""children ought to obey.... God has ordained it ... do what you are"
1206,III,"bidden ... for your papa, ... for me ... for Josèphe.... If she could"
1207,III,speak she would tell you to be good and obedient.... Would you make her
1208,III,"sorrowful in Heaven?"""
1209,III,
1210,III,"--""Oh! no,"" cried the child, throwing herself again into Mathieu's arms."
1211,III,
1212,III,"--""Then you will come?"" asked he."
1213,III,
1214,III,"--""Yes,"" murmured the little girl."
1215,III,
1216,III,"--""And you won't be afraid; you won't say a word?"""
1217,III,
1218,III,"--""No."""
1219,III,
1220,III,"--""Let's be going then!"" exclaimed the keeper, who had got up and was"
1221,III,"looking over the parapet. ""The high rock is out of water; we mustn't"
1222,III,"wait any longer."""
1223,III,
1224,III,He took Francine in his arms and went rapidly down one of the foot-paths
1225,III,"leading to the shore of the islet. Geneviève followed, in inexpressible"
1226,III,anguish. All three reached a rocky point that stretched far out into
1227,III,the waters. It was the extremity of the line of reefs that connected the
1228,III,"powder-magazine with Trébéron. Ropars placed the child on the ground, in"
1229,III,"order to take note of his direction. The passage, under the rays of the"
1230,III,"moon, was tinged with pale green, varied by small lines of white that"
1231,III,were made by the light fringe of foam upon the waves. So gentle were
1232,III,"their undulations, that one might have fancied a field of green wheat"
1233,III,"chequered with white camomile flowers. Beyond, the Ile des Morts in all"
1234,III,"its breadth was illumined by the moonlight, with its yellowish"
1235,III,"buildings, its long slated roofs, and its lightning-rods, standing out"
1236,III,"against the sky. So calm was the night that the sentry's step was heard,"
1237,III,"as he paced up and down before the watch-box of granite, built at the"
1238,III,"corner of the esplanade. At the forked head of the two islands, and"
1239,III,"partially in shadow, lay the silent gun-boat, balancing at anchor."
1240,III,
1241,III,Ropars examined every thing with scrupulous attention. He pointed out to
1242,III,"Geneviève the direction of the submarine causeway, indicated by a faint"
1243,III,"shadow on the surface of the water, as he threw aside his waistcoat and"
1244,III,"hat; then taking both of his wife's hands, who looked at him with"
1245,III,"haggard eyes,--""the time is come, Geneviève,"" said he; ""kiss me, and"
1246,III,"pray the good God to be with us."""
1247,III,
1248,III,"The poor woman responded at first to his embrace, without power to utter"
1249,III,a word; but when she felt that he had disengaged himself and was
1250,III,"returning towards the child, a cry escaped her; she was not mistress of"
1251,III,"herself. She forgot all that Mathieu had said to her, all that she"
1252,III,"herself had promised, and encircled him with her arms in all the"
1253,III,desperation of terror.
1254,III,
1255,III,"--""You shall not go,"" she stammered out, ""you shall not go!... It is"
1256,III,"rushing on to death ... in the name of your marriage-vow, remain to be"
1257,III,"my succour, my companion!... Would you then leave me here alone with"
1258,III,"Josèphe?... Look, how broad the sea is, and how deep! You and Francine,"
1259,III,"you will be lost in it!... Ah! if it be God's will, let us all die here;"
1260,III,"but at least let us die together! Mathieu, I will not have you quit me;"
1261,III,"you shall not carry off my child; you shall not go!"""
1262,III,
1263,III,"Ropars endeavoured to calm her, and struggled to release himself from"
1264,III,"her hold; but she clung to him, and refused to hear a word. And as he"
1265,III,"recalled to her that she had, a minute before, induced Francine's"
1266,III,"consent,"
1267,III,
1268,III,"--""I was wrong,"" she wildly interrupted him; ""I will no longer have it"
1269,III,"so. If you leave me, I will follow; and you will be responsible before"
1270,III,"God for what may happen. Mathieu, do not tempt me! Mathieu, have pity on"
1271,III,"me!... What have I done to you, that you should thus go voluntarily to"
1272,III,destruction? Do you no longer care for life with me?... Ah! if I have
1273,III,"failed in my duty, be not angry with me, dear soul! If my too great"
1274,III,"anguish has offended you, forgive me! I will not cry any more; I will be"
1275,III,every thing that you desire. Hold; look on me rather; forgive me; but
1276,III,"say that you will stay."""
1277,III,
1278,III,"She had sunk down upon her knees, and held Ropars' hands pressed firmly"
1279,III,against her lips. He exerted himself to raise her up.
1280,III,
1281,III,"--""Enough, Geneviève,"" said he, in a tone wherein commiseration disputed"
1282,III,"with impatience; ""I thought that you were braver.... This is not what"
1283,III,"you promised me. Think, think, unhappy woman, that the time is passing"
1284,III,"away!"""
1285,III,
1286,III,"Geneviève groaned, and recommenced the same entreaties. He cast an"
1287,III,"anxious look towards the sea, and saw that the farthest jags of the high"
1288,III,"rock were dry. Longer delay would increase the danger, and might render"
1289,III,"the passage impossible. Mathieu seized Geneviève sharply by the elbows,"
1290,III,"and raised her upon her feet, with her face opposite his own."
1291,III,
1292,III,"--""On your salvation, listen!"" said he, in accent so decided that she"
1293,III,"trembled at it; ""this is the first time that I have reminded you that I"
1294,III,"am your master, and, if you be not wiser, it will perhaps be the last;"
1295,III,"but by the God who saved us, you shall obey, and that without further"
1296,III,discussion! The child's life is to be preserved; nothing can stay me
1297,III,"now. Remain there, I solemnly command you, and make not one step, nor"
1298,III,"utter one single cry, or, so surely as I am my mother's son, I will"
1299,III,"never forgive you, even until the day of Judgment!"""
1300,III,
1301,III,"At these words, he seated Geneviève, petrified by the shock, ran to his"
1302,III,"little daughter, whom he took upon his shoulders, and dashed with her"
1303,III,into the waves.
1304,III,
1305,III,"When Geneviève turned round, at the noise made by his plunge into the"
1306,III,"water, Ropars was on the causeway of the submerged reefs, and the waves"
1307,III,were rolling against his breast. She tried to get up; but her strength
1308,III,"failed her, and she could but utter a feeble cry. Mathieu heard it and"
1309,III,looked back. He could see through the moonlight the indistinct form of
1310,III,"Geneviève who, half-lying down upon the rock, was wringing her joined"
1311,III,"hands as though towards him. He found his heart, which he had steeled by"
1312,III,"an effort of will, sinking within him in pity for her. Taking note of"
1313,III,"the waters, green and deep, whose abysses were opening around him,"
1314,III,hearing over his head the breathings of the child who panted with
1315,III,"terror, and thinking that the hapless creature from whom they had just"
1316,III,"parted violently might perchance never see them more, there came across"
1317,III,"him a feeling of commiseration so tender, that tears almost filled his"
1318,III,"eyes; he paused, in spite of himself, in the midst of the murmuring"
1319,III,"waves, turned his head backwards towards the shore, and called to her in"
1320,III,"a voice, restrained but full of gentleness--""Don't cry Geneviève; and"
1321,III,"God bless you! all will go well."""
1322,III,
1323,III,"Then, without waiting for an answer, which he feared might unman him, he"
1324,III,"went on his way, his eyes fixed upon the line along the water that"
1325,III,"marked the direction of the reef. Soon, however, he ceased to"
1326,III,distinguish that particular appearance of the waves which rendered it
1327,III,"easy to trace this line from the shore. Immersed in the sea, he no"
1328,III,"longer saw anything beyond him, but a surface uniform and agitated,"
1329,III,without any distinctive movement or colour. He was therefore compelled
1330,III,to shape his course direct for the rock on the Ile des Morts whereon the
1331,III,"causeway abutted, and which with its pointed ridges was visible,"
1332,III,far-away in the obscurity.
1333,III,
1334,III,"Armed with a broken boat-hook, Mathieu sounded at each step that he"
1335,III,"took; but notwithstanding all his care, the difficulty of his course"
1336,III,increased at every moment. The unevenness of the rocks exposed him to
1337,III,"incessant stumbling. Lifted off his feet by the waves, half-stunned by"
1338,III,"the deep rumbling noise that was around him, groping along a path"
1339,III,"irregular and strange to him and bounded on either side by an abyss, he"
1340,III,"advanced with the greatest deliberation, his strong will controlling his"
1341,III,"impatience, and his whole soul rivetted upon his every movement. His"
1342,III,fixed gaze sought to pierce the liquid veil of the waters; his hands
1343,III,glued to the boat-hook seemed to long to solder it to the reef; his
1344,III,"feet, in an agony of search, seemed to force themselves to guess at"
1345,III,"their path, before they would select it. Thus he reached the middle of"
1346,III,"the passage, where he came into the neighbourhood of the gun-boat. All"
1347,III,"there was silent; nothing stirred. The cries of ""Watch, Watch!"" uttered"
1348,III,"at intervals by the look-out at each cat-head, had for some time ceased"
1349,III,"to be heard; their two shadows even were not perceptible, for they had"
1350,III,long been immovable at their post. Certain that their look-out was
1351,III,"altogether needless, the sailors on watch were without doubt asleep."
1352,III,
1353,III,"Mathieu, who was afraid that they might awake, was anxious to avoid this"
1354,III,danger by hurrying on; but at the very moment when he came within the
1355,III,"shadow thrown, abaft the gun-boat, over the glittering waters, his"
1356,III,footing of rock failed him by suddenly shelving downwards. Francine felt
1357,III,"him sinking, as a vessel that founders, and the waves washed up over her"
1358,III,hair. She could not restrain a piercing shriek.
1359,III,
1360,III,"Her father, in extreme alarm, lowered her down against his breast, and"
1361,III,pressed one hand upon her lips. But it was too late; the cry had
1362,III,"undoubtedly been overheard, for a shadow immediately rose up, forward,"
1363,III,and the noise of footsteps echoed along the deck. Ropars had but time to
1364,III,"throw himself under the taffrail of the stationary vessel, and to grasp"
1365,III,"a boom, whereto he remained suspended."
1366,III,
1367,III,"One of the sailors on watch came aft, and was immediately joined by his"
1368,III,comrade.
1369,III,
1370,III,"--""The devil take me, if I didn't hear a cry,"" said the former."
1371,III,
1372,III,"--""Pardieu! it half-woke me up,"" added the second."
1373,III,
1374,III,"--""But I've looked about, and it's no use; I don't see any thing."""
1375,III,
1376,III,"--""Nor I."""
1377,III,
1378,III,"The couple were leaning over the sea, which kept up its gentle"
1379,III,"murmurings, and on which only light undulations were visible, fringed"
1380,III,with half-phosphorescent foam. The second man of the watch seemed all at
1381,III,"once to be seized with inquietude, that caused his voice to tremble."
1382,III,
1383,III,"--""I say, Morvan,"" he cautiously began, ""those Roscanvel and Lanvoc"
1384,III,"barks haven't passed by, without leaving some christian soul under water"
1385,III,"here--don't you think so?"""
1386,III,
1387,III,"--""Why so?"" asked Morvan."
1388,III,
1389,III,"--""Why so?"" returned the sailor, who seemed half-afraid and"
1390,III,"half-ashamed; ""why, parbleu! ... you know what they say ... I didn't"
1391,III,"invent it ... there are some people who tell you that shipwrecked men,"
1392,III,"dying in mortal sin, leave their souls upon the waves that drowned them:"
1393,III,"and that every year, on the day and at the exact time of the accident,"
1394,III,"they utter a cry of anguish, just by way of asking prayers for"
1395,III,"themselves."""
1396,III,
1397,III,"--""And you believe that, you, Lascar?"" said Morvan with a laugh more"
1398,III,blustering than assured.
1399,III,
1400,III,"--""It isn't I,"" rejoined the sailor, ""it's our mess-mates.... But, none"
1401,III,"the less, the voice wasn't like any body else's; it was sharp and thin,"
1402,III,"as one might say that of a child."""
1403,III,
1404,III,"--""Get out, nonsense!"" interrupted the first seaman, evidently"
1405,III,"disquieted by his comrade's explanation; ""you see there's nothing more"
1406,III,"to be heard, and there is nothing afloat but the moonlight, and the"
1407,III,night-chill that will make us sneeze. It's well that we both kept our
1408,III,"allowance of wine. Come on, let's go and drink it; that'll put your"
1409,III,"morality into trim again."""
1410,III,
1411,III,"The two sailors went off. After waiting a moment, Mathieu replaced the"
1412,III,"child on his shoulders, enjoined strict silence, at the same time"
1413,III,"cheering her up, and let go the boom for the purpose of regaining the"
1414,III,"causeway; but he had lost the direction, and his feet encountered only"
1415,III,"empty space. Forced to swim with his precious burden, he hoped that a"
1416,III,few fathoms' distance would bring him back to his pathway on the reefs;
1417,III,he had already gone beyond it. Fresh attempts were not more successful;
1418,III,"and twenty times did he renew his search, finding only, at each, deep"
1419,III,water.
1420,III,
1421,III,"Frightened and panting for breath, he swam about without aim,"
1422,III,"endeavouring to touch ground, and no longer able to distinguish the Ile"
1423,III,"des Morts from Trébéron. After having long shifted his course, struggled"
1424,III,"against the tide in which every moment he plunged still deeper, been a"
1425,III,"thousand times brought back from despair to hope, and run the full"
1426,III,"length of his endurance and his courage, he felt at last that he was"
1427,III,"overcome. His respiration grew painful, his eyes were covered with a"
1428,III,film; all things were to him but as a revolving chaos; his mind
1429,III,"wandered. A moment more, and he and Francine had disappeared beneath the"
1430,III,"waters. The gun-boat, which he had wished to avoid, but which he could"
1431,III,"no longer perceive, was his sole means of safety. He summoned all his"
1432,III,"remaining strength to utter a cry for help; a surge, more powerful,"
1433,III,stifled it on his lips. Half-fainting and having nothing left him but
1434,III,"that instinctive self-defence which survives the will, he struggled"
1435,III,"still an instant, buffeted from wave to wave; then felt that he was"
1436,III,"going down. But all at once, he was arrested; his feet had fallen on to"
1437,III,"the reef; they were fastened on it, and steadied themselves thereon;"
1438,III,his body straightened up; the water that blinded him seemed to lower
1439,III,"itself. He took breath and looked before him, and could see at the"
1440,III,distance of a hundred steps the cleft rock of the Ile des Morts. A few
1441,III,minutes sufficed for reaching it. Touching the shore he fell down upon
1442,III,"it, and called Francine with expiring voice. The child, terrified, could"
1443,III,"only reply by throwing herself upon his breast, where he held her for"
1444,III,some time in his embrace. His first thought had been for her; his second
1445,III,"carried him back to Geneviève who was expecting his return, to know that"
1446,III,"they were safe. Still tottering, he raised himself up, took his little"
1447,III,"daughter by the hand, and set himself to climbing the steep slope that"
1448,III,led to the terrace.
1449,III,
1450,III,"It was necessary to make the tour of the powder magazine, to avoid the"
1451,III,sentinel placed at the angle which commanded the main roadside; and
1452,III,"also, on reaching the magazine keeper's door, to knock gently, for fear"
1453,III,of being heard from without. Dorot fortunately had the light sleep of
1454,III,"old soldiers; he awoke at the first knocking, and appeared at the"
1455,III,window.
1456,III,
1457,III,"--""Open the door!"" said Mathieu to him in a low voice."
1458,III,
1459,III,"--""Ropars!"" cried the sergeant, thunderstruck."
1460,III,
1461,III,"--""Lower! and be quick!"" returned the seaman ""our lives' safety is at"
1462,III,"stake."""
1463,III,
1464,III,"Dorot went down rapidly, drew back the bolt, and made them enter the"
1465,III,"house. Mathieu paused, when across the thresh-hold, with the child"
1466,III,pressed against his knees.
1467,III,
1468,III,"--""Heaven protect us! whence come you, Ropars?"" inquired the sergeant."
1469,III,
1470,III,"--""You see,"" replied the sailor, ""we have come out of the sea, and we"
1471,III,"have crossed over it, to come hither."""
1472,III,
1473,III,"Dorot drew back, exclaiming, ""Can it be? in God's name, what has"
1474,III,"happened, that you should thus expose your life?"""
1475,III,
1476,III,"--""It has happened,"" rejoined Mathieu, ""that Josèphe died this morning"
1477,III,"of the contagion! ... that""--"
1478,III,
1479,III,"--""What's that you say?"""
1480,III,
1481,III,"--""'Tis just so, Dorot; and as Geneviève and I were anxious to save the"
1482,III,"other one, I have brought her to you."""
1483,III,
1484,III,"--""And Heaven reward you for the thought!"" said the sergeant; ""the child"
1485,III,"is dearly welcome."""
1486,III,
1487,III,He had offered his hand to Mathieu; but the latter did not take it.
1488,III,
1489,III,"--""Think well what it is I am asking you,"" said he; ""perhaps the child"
1490,III,"may be bringing here disease and desolation upon you!"""
1491,III,
1492,III,"""I hope there will be nothing of the kind,"" returned Dorot; ""but God's"
1493,III,"will be done!"""
1494,III,
1495,III,"--""Bear in mind also,"" continued the quarter-master, insisting, ""that if"
1496,III,"the thing gets wind, you run a risk of punishment for having violated"
1497,III,"the quarantine."""
1498,III,
1499,III,"--""Then the will of man be done!"" was the sergeant's simple observation."
1500,III,
1501,III,"--""But still think."""
1502,III,
1503,III,"--""Of nothing further, Ropars,"" interrupted the sergeant; ""there! enough"
1504,III,said--too much. No words about the matter; you have brought me the
1505,III,"little one; I accept her."""
1506,III,
1507,III,"He had stooped down to Francine, whom he then took up in his arms, and"
1508,III,with her remounted to the small chamber formerly occupied by Geneviève.
1509,III,"He, himself, stripped off from the child her dripping clothes, and put"
1510,III,her to sleep in an old cot of Michael's.
1511,III,
1512,III,"The father, who had followed them, remained at the door with his arms"
1513,III,"hanging down at his side, the very picture of gratitude deeply felt, but"
1514,III,"unable to vent itself in words. Only, when Dorot turned round towards"
1515,III,"him, he seized one of his hands and held it silently grasped. Dorot, who"
1516,III,"desired to avoid a scene, began at once to talk of the means of"
1517,III,concealing the little girl's change of abode. It was sufficient that her
1518,III,absence from Trébéron would not be remarked; as for her being at the Ile
1519,III,"des Morts, it could not give rise to any suspicion, since the guard of"
1520,III,"artillery that did duty at the magazine, and that might have been"
1521,III,"surprised at this increase in the keeper's family, was to be changed on"
1522,III,the following day. Ropars arranged certain signals for transmitting
1523,III,mutually the news between the neighbour islands. These were to be
1524,III,"renewed several times a day, and thus relieve them at least from the"
1525,III,"anguish of uncertainty. At length, when all had been agreed upon,"
1526,III,"Mathieu drew near the window and looked out. The breeze had freshened,"
1527,III,"the sky appeared less starry, and a transparent vapour was beginning to"
1528,III,creep over the sea.
1529,III,
1530,III,"--""It is time to start,"" said he, returning towards the sergeant; ""may"
1531,III,"God pay you for what you do, Dorot! As for Geneviève and myself, we"
1532,III,"shall remain your debtors to all eternity."""
1533,III,
1534,III,"--""We'll talk of that, by and by,"" replied the keeper; ""just now, the"
1535,III,"main thing, and that which troubles me, is the passage over."""
1536,III,
1537,III,"--""Don't be uneasy about that,"" answered Ropars; ""now that the child is"
1538,III,"in safety, I shall cross the channel just as easily as one goes to"
1539,III,church. The limbs are firm when the heart doesn't tremble. But I wish I
1540,III,"were already on the other side; I've stayed here too long for Geneviève,"
1541,III,"who is looking for me."""
1542,III,
1543,III,"--""Away, then! if it must be,"" cried the sergeant; ""but for God's sake,"
1544,III,"Ropars, be careful, and don't forget that you have two lives to save"
1545,III,"with your own."""
1546,III,
1547,III,"--""I'll do all that a man can do,"" returned the quarter-master; ""and"
1548,III,"believe me, cousin, I've no desire to die this night!... But too much"
1549,III,"talk; the time is slipping away; I mustn't wait for the change of tide."""
1550,III,
1551,III,"He went up to Francine's cot, to take leave of her; but the child,"
1552,III,"wearied out by so many emotions, had dropped off to sleep. One of her"
1553,III,"arms was doubled beneath her head, and lost in the loosened tresses of"
1554,III,"her golden hair; the other, folded on her breast, pressed to it a little"
1555,III,"relic formerly given to Geneviève who, in her superstitious motherly"
1556,III,"devotedness, had deprived herself of it that it might be a safe-guard"
1557,III,"for her child. Although her breathing was equal and easy, still was it"
1558,III,"broken at intervals by a long drawn sigh; whilst her cheeks, that in her"
1559,III,"sleep were beginning to re-assume their rosy tint, still showed some"
1560,III,traces of tears. Mathieu looked at her for some moments in touching
1561,III,"silence; then bending himself slowly down, imprinted a light kiss upon"
1562,III,"Francine's tiny hand, then one upon her hair, then one upon her cheek."
1563,III,"Without opening her eyes, the child made a gesture of annoyance; he"
1564,III,stood up.
1565,III,
1566,III,"--""Yes, yes, there, sleep, poor creature of a merciful God!"" he"
1567,III,"half-muttered; ""I will not wake you."""
1568,III,
1569,III,Once more he seemed to enwrap her in a look overflowing with tenderness;
1570,III,"then returned to Dorot, and took his hand."
1571,III,
1572,III,"--""I bequeath her to you, cousin,"" said he, moved in the extreme; ""no"
1573,III,"one knows what may happen. Only ... I can trust in your kindly heart,"
1574,III,"and if ever the child should become an orphan...."""
1575,III,
1576,III,"--""Now God preserve her from it!"" the sergeant took him up; ""but if such"
1577,III,"misfortune should occur to her, Mathieu, you know well that she would"
1578,III,"become Michael's sister."""
1579,III,
1580,III,"--""Thanks!"" abruptly broke in the seaman; ""that's exactly what I was"
1581,III,longing to hear.... And now I set out calmly. I am prepared for every
1582,III,"thing."""
1583,III,
1584,III,"--""But you shan't set out thus, shivering and pulled down,"" objected the"
1585,III,"sergeant; ""you must take something to cheer up your spirits."""
1586,III,
1587,III,"--""Nothing,"" said Ropars, eagerly; ""you have given me all that can give"
1588,III,"me strength, in giving me the assurance that the child will not remain"
1589,III,unaided. Providence will do the rest. Your hand! and good-bye till we
1590,III,"meet--here, or elsewhere!"""
1591,III,
1592,III,"They heartily embraced; then Mathieu went down to the shore, and"
1593,III,committed himself again to the waters. Although the tide had begun to
1594,III,"rise, the passage was effected without overmuch danger. He reached,"
1595,III,"unharmed, the high rock of Trébéron which the floodtide had already"
1596,III,"encroached upon, and he ran to the place where he had left Geneviève."
1597,III,She was there no longer.
1598,III,
1599,III,"Astonished that she should not have awaited his return, he rapidly"
1600,III,"mounted the foot-path, reached his door, and called aloud. There was no"
1601,III,reply. The darkness did not allow him to distinguish any thing. He
1602,III,"groped his way to the hearth, and threw around him the trembling light"
1603,III,"of a lamp hurriedly lighted. Attracted to the alcove, his glance soon"
1604,III,"made out, beside the white form of the dead sewed up in its shroud, the"
1605,III,"outline of another and a larger form, extended without moving. Mathieu"
1606,III,approached in agony. It was Geneviève in a swoon.
1607,III,
1608,III,
1609,IV.,IV.
1610,IV.,
1611,IV.,
1612,IV.,"Thanks to the Surgeon's skill, Ropars' wife at length regained her"
1613,IV.,"senses; but it was to fall into convulsive spasms, followed by the"
1614,IV.,annihilation of all her faculties. The whole day passed without her
1615,IV.,shaking off the torpor that belonged at once to sleep and to death. One
1616,IV.,"might have said that so many shocks had snapped asunder her existence,"
1617,IV.,"and that the quiverings of life, still flitting across her state of"
1618,IV.,"languor, were but the movements of a machine on the point of stopping."
1619,IV.,"However, towards evening, the fever declared itself. The patient passed"
1620,IV.,insensibly from lethargy to delirious agitation; she did but recognize
1621,IV.,"Mathieu at intervals; and falling back, with her senses, upon her"
1622,IV.,"sorrows, she soon fell again into wandering."
1623,IV.,
1624,IV.,None of these symptoms seemed to belong to the malady that ravaged the
1625,IV.,"lazaretto; and the Surgeon, disconcerted, let Mathieu divine his"
1626,IV.,inability to make it out. Accustomed to the coarse medicines required by
1627,IV.,"the robust patients of our ships, he was perforce a stranger, as are all"
1628,IV.,"like him, to the ailments of more delicate natures. Thus did he stand"
1629,IV.,"baffled before this woman, dying of a disorder such as he vainly sought"
1630,IV.,"to trace in his experiences. He could not conceal his doubts, and his"
1631,IV.,"need of more enlightened advice. Science, to which these mysterious and"
1632,IV.,"redoubtable symptoms were familiarized, might find there an index, where"
1633,IV.,"he perceived only confusion, and point out a remedy, which he dared but"
1634,IV.,essay at hap-hazard.
1635,IV.,
1636,IV.,"This avowal, wrung from his loyal truth, was for Mathieu a new source of"
1637,IV.,torture. Shut up within prescribed limits which forbid strangers to
1638,IV.,"approach Trébéron, he could not invoke that experience to which"
1639,IV.,"Geneviève might perchance owe her safety. In vain did he see, at his"
1640,IV.,"feet, boats for transporting him across the sea, and on the horizon a"
1641,IV.,town whence aid might be brought to him; an obstacle invincible and
1642,IV.,insurmountable linked him to his source of trouble.
1643,IV.,
1644,IV.,"Two whole days passed away for him, as one long agony, in alternations"
1645,IV.,of mute dejection and of furious despair. After sitting for several
1646,IV.,"hours at the bedside of the dying woman, when he saw the fever that had"
1647,IV.,"been lulled for an instant now returning with increased force, he ran"
1648,IV.,"down to the edge of the reefs, gazed upon the waters in the midst of"
1649,IV.,"which he found himself imprisoned, upon the armed vessel that guarded"
1650,IV.,"the passage, upon the ravines of the island dotted with graves recently"
1651,IV.,"dug, and pressing his closed fists against his forehead he cursed the"
1652,IV.,day on which he had accepted this voluntary imprisonment. Angrily did he
1653,IV.,"call God to account for the blows with which he was stricken; then,"
1654,IV.,"restored to his religious faith, he joined his hands, and with tears"
1655,IV.,besought the Almighty to spare Geneviève.
1656,IV.,
1657,IV.,"Towards the morning of the third day, he had cause for believing that"
1658,IV.,"his prayers had been heard. The fever abated, and the patient recovered"
1659,IV.,all her clearness of mind. But this change did not induce her to share
1660,IV.,the delight or the hopes of Mathieu.
1661,IV.,
1662,IV.,"--""Never believe that this is a cure, dear soul,"" said she in tones"
1663,IV.,"scarcely audible, and alternating every phrase with periods of silence;"
1664,IV.,"""the disease is going ... but it carries all with it.... That evening,"
1665,IV.,when you went across the channel ... when I heard the child's cry from
1666,IV.,out of the sea itself ... I thought it was all over with you both ...
1667,IV.,and then ... I can't say what took place ... but it seemed to me ...
1668,IV.,that within me ... the main string of life was snapped.... So I feel
1669,IV.,"now, that it's all over."""
1670,IV.,
1671,IV.,"Ropars combatted these fears, repeating that the Surgeon was encouraged,"
1672,IV.,"and that all would go well. Geneviève, whose eyes were closed, raised"
1673,IV.,the lids with difficulty and threw a glance upon him that was full of
1674,IV.,melancholy sweetness.
1675,IV.,
1676,IV.,"--""God is the master, Mathieu,"" said she; ""he knows whether I am happy"
1677,IV.,"in living with you.... Only, ... believe me, poor husband, and don't"
1678,IV.,"rejoice too much ... it were wiser to expect the worst."""
1679,IV.,
1680,IV.,"--""It were wiser,"" interrupted the quarter-master, ""to take rest, and"
1681,IV.,"have confidence. I, too, trust in what I feel. This very night, I had a"
1682,IV.,weight of lead upon my heart; it is light now; I can breathe in one
1683,IV.,"single breath. In God's name, let your health be restored to you, and be"
1684,IV.,"anxious for a continuance of life, if it were but for my sake."""
1685,IV.,
1686,IV.,Geneviève made an effort to lay her cold and moistened hand upon that of
1687,IV.,Ropars.
1688,IV.,
1689,IV.,"--""You are good, Mathieu,"" said she, letting fall two little tears, the"
1690,IV.,last that emotion could drain from eyes already exhausted with weeping.
1691,IV.,"""Ah me! my chief regret now is at not having always thought of this ..."
1692,IV.,at not having shown myself sufficiently grateful.... Heavens! how much
1693,IV.,"worthier we should be of those we love, if we did but remember that some"
1694,IV.,"day we must leave them.... Since my mind has returned, this idea has"
1695,IV.,haunted me; I now perceive all my faults; ... I feel remorse for
1696,IV.,"them.... Oh! tell me in mercy, Mathieu, do you forgive me now ... for"
1697,IV.,"never having been what I ought to have been?"""
1698,IV.,
1699,IV.,"--""Talk not so, Geneviève,"" said the seaman quickly, and with deep"
1700,IV.,"feeling; ""you know well that I could not have asked from God a better"
1701,IV.,"wife. Since you have been mine, I have wanted for nothing; it is I who"
1702,IV.,"should be grateful to you."""
1703,IV.,
1704,IV.,"--""No, no,"" replied the sick woman with increasing animation; ""many a"
1705,IV.,time have I lacked courage and patience.... Not with you alone ... but
1706,IV.,"with Francine ... with Josèphe! ... poor child of my heart, who had so"
1707,IV.,"few years to live!... And to think, Mathieu, that I have often made her"
1708,IV.,"cry! ... her, who is now beneath the ground!... Ah! it is the tears of"
1709,IV.,"the dead that weigh heavily here.... And other persons, whom I may have"
1710,IV.,injured ... and God against whom I have sinned!... Cannot I then hope
1711,IV.,"for mercy?"""
1712,IV.,
1713,IV.,"Then, as if this idea had awakened in her a sort of terror:"
1714,IV.,
1715,IV.,"--""Ah! it is impossible!"" added she, sitting up; ""Mathieu, Mathieu, I"
1716,IV.,"must see a confessor!"""
1717,IV.,
1718,IV.,"--""But how to get him here?"" said the quarter-master sorrowfully; ""have"
1719,IV.,"you forgotten that the island is in quarantine?"""
1720,IV.,
1721,IV.,"--""What! not to be able to save even one's soul?"" returned Geneviève,"
1722,IV.,"clasping her hands. ""Alas! am I then doomed to die without"
1723,IV.,reconciliation? My God! what is to be done? The most miserable sinner is
1724,IV.,"allowed to confess his sins, and to ask absolution for them; my God!"
1725,IV.,"must I alone remain without help?"""
1726,IV.,
1727,IV.,"She stopped abruptly, putting up both hands to her forehead."
1728,IV.,
1729,IV.,"--""Ah! I remember now,"" she resumed; ""have you not told me that on board"
1730,IV.,"your ships, when at the moment of death no priest was to be had, any"
1731,IV.,"Christian might take his place? ... that God looked to the intention?"""
1732,IV.,
1733,IV.,"--""I have said so,"" replied Ropars, ""and all the seamen hereabouts will"
1734,IV.,"tell you the same thing, upon the assurance of their pastors."""
1735,IV.,
1736,IV.,"--""Then,"" replied the dying woman, turning towards the seaman her eye"
1737,IV.,"lustrous with the fever, ""I desire to confess myself to you!"""
1738,IV.,
1739,IV.,"She raised herself upon her elbow, and crossed herself. Mathieu seemed"
1740,IV.,"overwhelmed, but could make no objection to her will. As we have"
1741,IV.,"remarked, he belonged to that race almost extinct, even in Brittany, in"
1742,IV.,whom still existed the earnest and the simple faith of other days.
1743,IV.,"Often, on occasion of shipwreck, men such as he might have been seen,"
1744,IV.,"after exhausting all means of saving themselves, to kneel down in the"
1745,IV.,"expectation of death, and confess themselves one to another, as did the"
1746,IV.,ancient cavaliers on the eve of combat. Therefore was he more troubled
1747,IV.,than surprised at the request of Geneviève; and when he heard her murmur
1748,IV.,"the prayer that precedes confession, he took off his hat and made the"
1749,IV.,"sign of the cross, ready to fulfill the holy office that necessity had"
1750,IV.,entrusted to him.
1751,IV.,
1752,IV.,And something mournful and touching was it. The early dawn of day light
1753,IV.,doubtfully illumined the alcove; the dishevelled head of Geneviève was
1754,IV.,bent towards the grizzled head of Mathieu; and one might have heard the
1755,IV.,"murmur of that supremest confidence carried on in lowered voice, often"
1756,IV.,"interrupted by the failure of the dying woman's strength, or by the"
1757,IV.,seaman's entreaties that she would curtail it. But she persisted in
1758,IV.,"resuming it, with the determination peculiar to those severe consciences"
1759,IV.,"which are never satisfied with their self-accusations. At length, when"
1760,IV.,"she had concluded, Ropars detached the ivory crucifix from the head of"
1761,IV.,"the bed; he approached it to the lips of Geneviève, and placing his hand"
1762,IV.,"upon her brow with mournful solemnity,"
1763,IV.,
1764,IV.,"--""May God pardon thee as I do to the utmost of my power,"" said he; ""and"
1765,IV.,"if it be not his will that thou shouldst live for my happiness, may he"
1766,IV.,"provide for thee a place in his Paradise!"""
1767,IV.,
1768,IV.,Her face assumed an expression of ineffable serenity.
1769,IV.,
1770,IV.,"--""Thanks,"" murmured she; ""your absolution shall prevail before the"
1771,IV.,"Trinity, Mathieu; now I feel at peace."""
1772,IV.,
1773,IV.,A ray of sunlight creeping in through the window-curtain reached her
1774,IV.,bed; she turned round.
1775,IV.,
1776,IV.,"--""It is day,"" continued she; ""I did not hope to see another.... God has"
1777,IV.,given me a respite!... He is willing that I should taste of the latest
1778,IV.,"joy that I looked for upon earth ... nor will you refuse it to me,"
1779,IV.,"Mathieu?"""
1780,IV.,
1781,IV.,"--""Ask it, Geneviève,"" said the mariner; ""what man can do, I will do."""
1782,IV.,
1783,IV.,She took his hand and looked at him.
1784,IV.,
1785,IV.,"--""You have told me, haven't you, that cousin could see and make out"
1786,IV.,"your signals?"""
1787,IV.,
1788,IV.,"--""Yes, and it is true."""
1789,IV.,
1790,IV.,"--""Then by all the affection you bear me, Mathieu, I beseech you to"
1791,IV.,signalize him at once to bring Francine out upon his terrace; when she
1792,IV.,"is there, you will take me in your arms, you will carry me to the high"
1793,IV.,"rock, and if God grant me grace, I shall reach it with still life enough"
1794,IV.,"left to see my child once more, and to embrace her in spirit."""
1795,IV.,
1796,IV.,"--""It shall be done so as you desire, Geneviève,"" said the"
1797,IV.,"quarter-master, who, impressed by the presentiments of the dying one,"
1798,IV.,"had abandoned hope, and had not strength to refuse her anything."
1799,IV.,
1800,IV.,"--""Quickly, then, very quickly!... for I feel that God is calling me."""
1801,IV.,
1802,IV.,"Ropars rushed out, as though he feared there would scarcely be time; but"
1803,IV.,"he came in again almost in a moment, exclaiming that Francine was"
1804,IV.,already on the terrace of the magazine with Dorot. Stretching out her
1805,IV.,"hands to him, the dying woman uttered a feeble cry of joy. He wrapped"
1806,IV.,"her up in his winter-cape, and carried her gently in his arms as far as"
1807,IV.,the parapet of their platform.
1808,IV.,
1809,IV.,"--""Where is she?"" inquired Geneviève, her eyes blinded by the light of"
1810,IV.,"day, and trying in vain to look steadily; ""I can't make out anything,"
1811,IV.,"Mathieu! where is the child: show me the child!"""
1812,IV.,
1813,IV.,"--""Look down there at our feet,"" replied the seaman; ""can you see the"
1814,IV.,"high rock?"""
1815,IV.,
1816,IV.,"--""Yes."""
1817,IV.,
1818,IV.,"--""Can you follow the bubbling of the sea along the reef?"""
1819,IV.,
1820,IV.,"--""Yes, yes."""
1821,IV.,
1822,IV.,"--""And away, yonder, over the reefs, can you distinguish the stone-work"
1823,IV.,"of the terrace?"""
1824,IV.,
1825,IV.,"--""Down there? ... no ... there's only a cloud! I can see nothing...."
1826,IV.,"Oh! if it be too late!... if she be there under my very eyes, and I can"
1827,IV.,"no longer see her!... My God, my God, once more, only once, let me see"
1828,IV.,"my child!"""
1829,IV.,
1830,IV.,"These words, or rather these mother's cries, had been so full of"
1831,IV.,"sadness, that Ropars could not restrain his tears. He seated his sinking"
1832,IV.,"wife upon the parapet, and himself kneeled down to support her."
1833,IV.,
1834,IV.,"--""Courage, Geneviève!"" he stammered out; ""look well to this side ..."
1835,IV.,"between the line of the sea and the sky."""
1836,IV.,
1837,IV.,"--""I am looking,"" said Geneviève, appearing in the effort to rally all"
1838,IV.,"the life left in her "".... Raise my head, Mathieu ... screen me from the"
1839,IV.,"sun...."""
1840,IV.,
1841,IV.,She checked herself with a stifled exclamation.
1842,IV.,
1843,IV.,"--""Ah! there she is! there she is!... She sees me ... she is lifting up"
1844,IV.,"her arms.... Francine ... my daughter ... my child!"""
1845,IV.,
1846,IV.,"So impulsively did she lean forward, that but for Ropars, she would"
1847,IV.,have thrown herself upon the rocks that sloped down to the sea. A
1848,IV.,flitting ray of life had lighted up her features; she sent kisses on her
1849,IV.,"fingers to the child, and talked to it as though it could hear her; she"
1850,IV.,"raised her hands to Heaven, with rapid and broken ejaculations; she"
1851,IV.,"smiled and wept at once. Finally, her strength failed to endure so great"
1852,IV.,"emotion, and her head fell upon the quarter-master's shoulder. In alarm,"
1853,IV.,"he took her again in his arms, to carry her back into the house; but she"
1854,IV.,made signs to him that she wished to remain out of-doors. He laid her
1855,IV.,"down upon the bench, whereon the family had been used to sit together in"
1856,IV.,"the evening, in front of the sea, which was now lighted up by the rising"
1857,IV.,"sun. After a swoon that lasted some time, she opened her eyes, and asked"
1858,IV.,for her daughter. Mathieu looked towards the powder magazine and said
1859,IV.,that Dorot had taken her away. She bowed her head with sorrowing
1860,IV.,resignation.
1861,IV.,
1862,IV.,"--""He has done right,"" she went on, in feeble accents; ... ""besides, I"
1863,IV.,feel ... that my sight grows thick.... I couldn't see her any more ...
1864,IV.,"and ... I still have something to say to you.... Come closer, Mathieu"
1865,IV.,... closer ... my voice is failing.... Give me your hand.... I want to
1866,IV.,"be sure that you hear me."""
1867,IV.,
1868,IV.,"Ropars knelt upon the sand, with one hand in that of his dying wife, and"
1869,IV.,"the other placed behind her, to support her."
1870,IV.,
1871,IV.,"--""You are going to stay alone,"" she continued. ""Elsewhere, you could"
1872,IV.,"perhaps endure it; but here, in the midst of the ocean, it is not the"
1873,IV.,"life of a man, or of a Christian.... You are used to having some one"
1874,IV.,keep you company ... some one to love you.... When I am gone ... another
1875,IV.,"one must take my place."""
1876,IV.,
1877,IV.,"--""Never!"" broke in Ropars."
1878,IV.,
1879,IV.,With her hand she silenced him.
1880,IV.,
1881,IV.,"--""Hush!"" said she gently; ""you must needs think this, so long as I am"
1882,IV.,"before your eyes ... but when I am laid in the grave, you will then feel"
1883,IV.,"your want.... Believe not that I would reproach you, my poor husband...."
1884,IV.,I do not wish to carry away your happiness with me in my winding
1885,IV.,"sheet.... No ... no ... wherever I may be, I shall need to know that you"
1886,IV.,"are well cared for."""
1887,IV.,
1888,IV.,"--""Enough, Geneviève!"" murmured the seaman, choking with emotion."
1889,IV.,
1890,IV.,"--""Let me go on to the end,"" she resumed; ""I have still one plea to"
1891,IV.,"urge.... When you take off the crape from your arm, Mathieu ... promise"
1892,IV.,me to think of the dear creature who is our child ... the child of both
1893,IV.,"... and who will remain with you, to remind you of me ... choose a wife"
1894,IV.,"who may fill my place towards her."""
1895,IV.,
1896,IV.,"--""What is it that you are asking me, and whom could I give her for a"
1897,IV.,"mother, after yourself?"" rejoined Ropars."
1898,IV.,
1899,IV.,"--""Some one"" ... Geneviève went on ... ""who would not grudge me the"
1900,IV.,having been chosen first ... some honest heart that would take kindly to
1901,IV.,an orphan ... who would talk to her of me ... who would teach her to
1902,IV.,love God ... and to obey you!... If you promise me that this shall be
1903,IV.,"so, Mathieu ... if you promise it on your honour ... and on your"
1904,IV.,"salvation, I shall fall asleep, at peace, and blessing you."""
1905,IV.,
1906,IV.,"Ropars made the promise, amidst sighs and groans; but this was the dying"
1907,IV.,"woman's last effort. After having thanked him by an embrace, she let"
1908,IV.,herself sink into her husband's arms. It almost seemed as though the
1909,IV.,"power of her will had slackened the steps of Death, for the sake of this"
1910,IV.,"final compact. Scarcely was it completed, when her sufferings"
1911,IV.,"recommenced. Carried back to the alcove, she died there towards the"
1912,IV.,"close of the day. Her last words were a prayer, in which her husband's"
1913,IV.,and her daughter's names were intermingled.
1914,IV.,
1915,IV.,"On the ensuing day, the grave in which Josèphe already reposed was"
1916,IV.,"re-opened to receive Geneviève, for, during the past month, Death had"
1917,IV.,reaped so abundantly that the barren island lacked space for his doleful
1918,IV.,"harvest. Informed of what had happened, by means of the signals agreed"
1919,IV.,"upon, the keeper of the powder-magazine brought Francine to the edge of"
1920,IV.,"his rock, and the child, on her knees, uttered a prayer for her mother's"
1921,IV.,"spirit, at the moment the funeral ceremony was ended, across the water."
1922,IV.,
1923,IV.,"This death was the last. Like those expiatory victims who, in"
1924,IV.,"sacrificing themselves, were wont to appease the anger of the Gods,"
1925,IV.,"Geneviève seemed, in going down to the tomb, as though she closed its"
1926,IV.,"doors behind her. A fortnight later, and the yellow flag slid down the"
1927,IV.,"flag staff that over-topped the lazaretto, and those who had been"
1928,IV.,"quarantined, now cured, went away in the frigate's long-boat. They only"
1929,IV.,"left behind them, on the dreary island, a man whose hair had become"
1930,IV.,"perfectly white, and a child in mourning clothes."

1938,I,
1939,I,
1940,I,Do not imagine that this is to be a love-story. Very few experiences
1941,I,furnish material for such. Rarer still is the ability to use the
1942,I,"material, when it falls in one's way. At any rate, I make no pretension"
1943,I,thereto.
1944,I,
1945,I,But it sometimes happens during the earlier and more tumultuous period
1946,I,"of a man's life, that casual occurrences take place, which do not indeed"
1947,I,"at the time immediately influence his actions or his fortunes, but which"
1948,I,in later days may be recalled with interest. Of this sort--if I mistake
1949,I,"not, or if I do not mar them in the telling--were my three meetings with"
1950,I,Mary Verner. I only met her thrice.
1951,I,
1952,I,"The first time--many a year has sped away since; but it seems, if I shut"
1953,I,my mental eye to events and feelings with which the interval has been
1954,I,"crowded, and my bodily eye to the library table before me, as if the"
1955,I,"little scene were being enacted here, now, to-day."
1956,I,
1957,I,Whence this power of summoning up the ghosts of long ago? Why should the
1958,I,"comparatively recent refuse to be stamped upon the memory, and the old"
1959,I,impressions refuse to fade? Let philosophers answer; I have no more
1960,I,inclination to write an essay than to tell a love-tale. My purpose I
1961,I,have already stated; though I omitted to mention that I write my own
1962,I,"veritable experience--with a change of names, a studied obscurity of"
1963,I,"dates, and a very slight change otherwise."
1964,I,
1965,I,"The precise year I do not remember, nor, consequently, my own exact age;"
1966,I,"but I must have been about fourteen. George Verner, Mary's brother--poor"
1967,I,"fellow! I saw his death registered, the other day, in that odious corner"
1968,I,of the _Times_--was my class-mate and play-mate at a school some few
1969,I,"miles from London. He was a good-looking and good-tempered fellow, if"
1970,I,not remarkable for his abilities. It chanced that I was--in the choice
1971,I,"language of the time and place--""a dab at Latin verses."" I helped George"
1972,I,once in a while with his exercises; and once in a while with the
1973,I,"mince-pies, that his mother's a cook used to send him on the sly. The"
1974,I,"first time that I saw her--Mary Verner I mean, not the cook--was on a"
1975,I,"whole holiday; George, who lived in the neighbourhood, had invited me to"
1976,I,"pass it with him. The old family coach came for us at ten o'clock, with"
1977,I,"the fat old horses and the fat old family coachman, just for all the"
1978,I,world as you may often meet them in the story-books that are called
1979,I,"""exceedingly natural,"" and as you now-a-days rarely find them in real"
1980,I,"life. Pony-phaetons, britzkas, coupés, ""Croydon-baskets,"" and"
1981,I,"nondescript vehicles that, being neither close carriages nor open, are"
1982,I,palmed off as both--these have superseded the full-bodied of my early
1983,I,recollections.
1984,I,
1985,I,I fancy that I see her now.... You perceive that though I note the
1986,I,"modern change in the carriage department, I recognize none such in the"
1987,I,"phraseology of our tongue. I fancy I see her now. You may, if you"
1988,I,"please, alter the wording; but that's the plain English of it."
1989,I,
1990,I,As we drove up the sweep that led from the lodge to the front entrance
1991,I,"of a very beautiful suburban villa, I leaned out of the window, with the"
1992,I,"curiosity natural to a boy of fourteen, on strange ground."
1993,I,
1994,I,"Mary Verner--I knew, by the family likeness, that she was George's elder"
1995,I,"sister, the moment my eye lighted on her--was trimming or watering her"
1996,I,"geraniums, in one of the recesses on either side of the porch."
1997,I,
1998,I,"""Here, Mary, here's Cuthbert _tertius_,"" said George, running up the"
1999,I,"steps, and pushing me before him."
2000,I,
2001,I,"""I know him; how d'ye do? I'm glad to see you,"" was the frank reception,"
2002,I,"spoken in a clear, round-toned, springy voice, that seemed to drop"
2003,I,without effort out of a rose-lipped mouth well-filled with well-knit
2004,I,"teeth. And as she spoke smilingly, she opened a pair of large brown eyes"
2005,I,that I have since thought--for boys don't know much about the law of
2006,I,colours--were designed to harmonize with what we call a clear brunette
2007,I,"complexion. Certainly, if the ballad of ""The Nut Brown Mayde"" be a model"
2008,I,"imitation of the antique, Mary Verner might have sat for the portrait."
2009,I,
2010,I,"But it was not so much her eyes that took hold of me, open though they"
2011,I,"did by degrees, wider and wider, until I wondered when they would cease"
2012,I,"opening; nor her coal-black hair, dressed as you may see it in the"
2013,I,likenesses by Sir Thomas Lawrence; nor her rosy mouth; nor her even
2014,I,"teeth; nor her figure full of grace, _svelte_ as the French call it, for"
2015,I,"which we have no answering word. It was not these, or any of them. It"
2016,I,"was the carolling of her few words, so free and unconcerned in tone. If"
2017,I,"I had not met her subsequently, I might have forgotten her looks; I"
2018,I,doubt whether her voice could have passed from me.
2019,I,
2020,I,I need not tax my memory or my invention about the trifling though happy
2021,I,"events of that day. It was pretty evident who was mistress of the house,"
2022,I,though the fond and proud mother of Mary Verner had the air of a
2023,I,"dignified and well-bred woman. Silent or talking, it was Mary who"
2024,I,"dispensed the honours, at least so far as the stranger was concerned."
2025,I,Probably it was the same with all comers; but this is only a surmise.
2026,I,
2027,I,"Well; the whole holiday came to an end, and we were driven back to the"
2028,I,"old school by the old coachman, our pockets full of chestnuts, and our"
2029,I,"boyish hearts full of a sense of supreme enjoyment, such we believe as,"
2030,I,"in later life, women feel after the best ball of the season, and men"
2031,I,after a splendid whitebait dinner at Blackwall. I recollect telling the
2032,I,"fellows in the dormitory what a jolly time we had been having, and how"
2033,I,"capitally George's pony leaped the fence on the common, round the"
2034,I,"corner, out of sight of the house. By the way, it was partly owing to"
2035,I,"that pony having engrossed so much of our time, that I had not regularly"
2036,I,"fallen in love with Mary Verner. Partly, I say, because I was further"
2037,I,saved from this predicament by a standing devotion to my pretty cousin
2038,I,"Rose, which the temptation had been strong enough, but not long enough"
2039,I,to disturb. I never went to George's house again; and ere long the image
2040,I,of his sister was stowed away on one of the upper shelves of my memory.
2041,I,"There it might have been smothered in dust, or even converted into it,"
2042,I,if chance had not taken it down and given it an airing.
2043,I,
2044,I,
2045,II,II
2046,II,
2047,II,
2048,II,Twenty-one--what a change from fourteen! How the pulse of life beats and
2049,II,"bounds! I was running a tilt at the pastimes, and doffing aside the"
2050,II,"cares of early manhood, when for the second time, I came across Mary"
2051,II,"Verner. Plump upon her, I would say, if I thought you would pardon the"
2052,II,coarseness of the expression. At any rate--and to be genteel--it was
2053,II,unexpectedly. Twenty-one gives very few thoughts to fourteen. It may be
2054,II,"a much longer distance thither, when one starts at seventy to go back;"
2055,II,but it is surprising how much more quickly you get over the intermediate
2056,II,ground. Let that be; only I don't believe I had given a thought to Mary
2057,II,"Verner, since the week or two that followed my first interview with her."
2058,II,
2059,II,"""Do come and dine with us on Monday,"" said my friend Mrs. F.; ""there"
2060,II,"will be a very charming girl here, whom you would like to see."""
2061,II,
2062,II,"""Positively?"""
2063,II,
2064,II,"""_Sans faute!_"""
2065,II,
2066,II,"""Then keep a place for me; I'll come."""
2067,II,
2068,II,"I went. It was a formal dinner-party. In the drawing-room, before going"
2069,II,"to table, Mrs. F. came across to me."
2070,II,
2071,II,"""Now I'll introduce you to our belle of the evening. You may escort her"
2072,II,"down to dinner. There she is, half-hidden behind that drapery. You can't"
2073,II,"have noticed her."""
2074,II,
2075,II,"""Miss Verner, let me present Mr. Cuthbert."""
2076,II,
2077,II,"I should have recognized Mary Verner, as she looked up, with those"
2078,II,"widely-opening brown eyes of hers, if her name had not been mentioned."
2079,II,"As it was, it was quite natural for me to remark that I believed I had"
2080,II,had the pleasure of seeing Miss Verner before.
2081,II,
2082,II,"And so in a few moments we were gossipping cosily about ""old times,"" as"
2083,II,"we, not very old people, called them."
2084,II,
2085,II,"The beautiful child had expanded into a very lovely woman, preserving"
2086,II,still the same characteristics of person and expression. The charm of
2087,II,"her voice was the same. You may be sure that when seated by her side,"
2088,II,"with the becoming glow of lamp-light overhead heightening, if possible,"
2089,II,those attractions which I rather hint than attempt to describe--you may
2090,II,"be sure, I say, that I found her very captivating."
2091,II,
2092,II,We talked of her brother George; of the pleasant house wherein I first
2093,II,"met her, and which was still her home; of her amiable and lady-like"
2094,II,mother who was still living; of the old pony now gathered to his sires;
2095,II,"of the old chestnut-trees even--in short, of all those unimportant"
2096,II,"associations, out of which, under such circumstances, one endeavours to"
2097,II,establish a trivial and flitting but very pleasant little bond of
2098,II,sympathy.
2099,II,
2100,II,I declare I was half ready to fall head over ears in love with her. And
2101,II,"she took it all with a simple unaffected grace, that seemed to be her"
2102,II,very nature.
2103,II,
2104,II,But we did not have all the talk to ourselves. I had not the presumption
2105,II,to engross her entirely. Nor would it have been possible. She was--there
2106,II,is no need to go over it all again--she was Mary Verner.
2107,II,
2108,II,"Nearly opposite to us at table sat a Mr. Easton, a young"
2109,II,"barrister--young, that is professionally, for he was apparently a man of"
2110,II,thirty or thereabouts. He would not have been singled out as a
2111,II,"lady-killer, for he was none of your regular Adonises, such as hang by"
2112,II,"dozens, in portraiture, upon the walls of our Royal Academy Exhibitions,"
2113,II,"and lounge complacently in our Fop's Alley at the Opera. When, however,"
2114,II,the excitement of conversation--in which he took an active and most
2115,II,"intelligent part--developed the fine play of his features, you would"
2116,II,"have pronounced him a man who added, to a cultivated and superior mind,"
2117,II,"a look that bespoke such gift. In fact there was a manly air about him,"
2118,II,"that claimed respect, if it did not challenge attention."
2119,II,
2120,II,"About the time when I made this notable discovery, I recollected that at"
2121,II,"the moment of my introduction to Miss Verner, Mr. Easton was gossipping"
2122,II,"with her in the secluded corner half-hidden by the drapery, though he"
2123,II,"moved away, with perfect good breeding, to give place to the new-comer."
2124,II,
2125,II,"About this time, too, there began--at which end of the table, I"
2126,II,"forget--an occasional play of badinage, whereof Mr. Easton was the"
2127,II,"subject. For a grave and earnest man, he seemed to receive it all in"
2128,II,exceedingly good part. To my surprise also--to say nothing of
2129,II,"annoyance--my fair neighbour was brought, after a while, within its"
2130,II,scope. Neither did she--I was forced to acknowledge within
2131,II,myself--evince either _mauvaise honte_ or sensitiveness. The truth was
2132,II,plain. They were engaged.
2133,II,
2134,II,"As a child's card-built house tumbles down when the table is shaken, so"
2135,II,"down went one of the prettiest little castles-in-the-air, that ever"
2136,II,simpleton built out of cards of his own shaping.
2137,II,
2138,II,"Down it went; though I flatter myself I was too much a man of the world,"
2139,II,"to let a glimpse of its dislocated plan be apparent. Indeed, in a few"
2140,II,"seconds, I had rallied myself on my own absurdity; gulped down my"
2141,II,disappointment; and resigned myself again to the charm that Mary Verner
2142,II,"still shed around her, if its tint was somewhat changed. Besides, I"
2143,II,"availed myself of the sudden opportunity thus afforded, for testing the"
2144,II,"practical value of one of my favourite theories, when I was a young"
2145,II,"fellow and affected to bask in the sunshine of human nature: to wit,"
2146,II,"that, apart from serious love-making, when a woman in either married or"
2147,II,"betrothed, she has therefrom an additional feather in her social cap. So"
2148,II,have I found it through life--always provided that the attractive and
2149,II,companionable qualities were otherwise in abundance. And this theory has
2150,II,at least given heartiness to my good wishes for my fairer acquaintances
2151,II,and friends. Is it not better to come to such a philosophical
2152,II,"conclusion, than to be always envying other people's good fortune?"
2153,II,
2154,II,"Shifting, therefore, my ground, I was rapidly possessed by a strong"
2155,II,interest in Miss Verner's future welfare--much of which was undoubtedly
2156,II,genuine.
2157,II,
2158,II,"Delicately, and by gently leading her on, I gathered something of the"
2159,II,"story of her courtship, though I must needs confess that I cannot now"
2160,II,call to mind a word of it. It may be of more interest to state that she
2161,II,"was to make Mr. Easton the happiest of men, within six weeks or so of"
2162,II,that time; and that the honey-moon was to be spent in a ramble on the
2163,II,Continent. Very emphatically and very sincerely did I wish her a
2164,II,pleasant time of it.
2165,II,
2166,II,But the most agreeable evenings will come to a close. This one--with its
2167,II,"revival of a boy's casual acquaintance, with its momentary"
2168,II,"castle-building, and its subsequent benevolence of feeling--this one,"
2169,II,"like all others, passed away. It did not die out, as the fag-end of a"
2170,II,"dinner-party sometimes will; it was cut short to me by the ""good night!"""
2171,II,"of Mary Verner, as she took her departure, leaning on Mr. Easton's arm,"
2172,II,in the train of an elderly female relative.
2173,II,
2174,II,"When the drawing-room door closed upon her graceful figure, I felt for a"
2175,II,"moment as though the gas had been suddenly turned off. I recollect,"
2176,II,"however, the hostess's observation, dropped to the accompaniment of a"
2177,II,playfully malicious smile:
2178,II,
2179,II,"""Didn't I tell you, you would like my friend Mary Verner?"""
2180,II,
2181,II,"""Yes,"" was the reply, ""and I have passed a most delightful evening; but"
2182,II,"I don't think it quite fair, Mrs. F.""--here there was a terrible smash"
2183,II,"of the theory--""to open the gates of Paradise, and then slam them in a"
2184,II,"poor fellow's face?"""
2185,II,
2186,II,"I was to have gone, that night, to a ball in Devonshire Place, expressly"
2187,II,to meet--Never mind; I was not in the humour for dancing or flirting. I
2188,II,"went straight home, and to bed. I tossed about a good deal, and finally"
2189,II,"dreamed about George and the pony, and that I was climbing the old"
2190,II,"chestnut-trees. As for Mary Verner, I couldn't in my sleep conjure up"
2191,II,"her image. When I thought I had it--as is the way in dreams, you know,"
2192,II,if you ever studied them--I couldn't get nearer to her than the plaguy
2193,II,"old family coachman. It was only when broad awake, the next morning,"
2194,II,"that I found myself strongly impressed by this, my second meeting. But"
2195,II,again--such is life and such is youth--the impression was soon stowed
2196,II,away on an upper shelf in memory's garret.
2197,II,
2198,II,

2200,III.,
2201,III.,
2202,III.,Two years later; two years and two months.
2203,III.,
2204,III.,Did you ever notice the marked difference between youth and old
2205,III.,"age--aye, and middle age, too--in the matter of reading newspapers?"
2206,III.,We--I speak of myself now as the writer--who are in the vanguard of the
2207,III.,"march through life, must have our _Times_ or our _Chronicle_, as"
2208,III.,"regularly as our morning meal. Is it, as some spitefully assert, that we"
2209,III.,grow more self-complacent as we pore over the misfortunes or the errors
2210,III.,"of our fellows; or is it, that we seek refuge from the cares and"
2211,III.,"disappointments of our own lot, in a close scrutiny of that of all the"
2212,III.,"world beside, with the minutiæ of which the diligent, prying, gossipping"
2213,III.,"press so unceasingly plies our curiosity? It is folly, perhaps, to raise"
2214,III.,"the question, since this is not the place to discuss it; though it were"
2215,III.,"not far from the truth to attribute much of the pettiness of our race,"
2216,III.,"in these days, to this habit of abandoning our thoughts and impulses to"
2217,III.,the guidance of journalists who trade in them.
2218,III.,
2219,III.,"I only mean to say that being still youthful at twenty-three, I ""cared"
2220,III.,"for none of these things,"" As for heeding who was born, or buried, or"
2221,III.,"married, beyond the circle of one's own intimate connections--I should"
2222,III.,as soon have set to work to trace the pedigree of a New Zealander.
2223,III.,"Probably, I heard in due time that Mary Verner had become Mrs. Easton."
2224,III.,"Certainly I did not learn it from the usual printed record. In short, I"
2225,III.,then very seldom read newspapers at all; and this I beg you to bear in
2226,III.,"mind. What a shocking ignoramus I should be voted, if I were to say so"
2227,III.,of this present time.
2228,III.,
2229,III.,"That, too, was the season of darkness, ere Albert Smith was the Lecturer"
2230,III.,"_par excellence_; ere Oxford and Cambridge men, returning from their"
2231,III.,"""long-vacation"" rambles, disputed in the daily papers their respective"
2232,III.,"prowess in scaling the precipices of Monte Rosa, or discovering new"
2233,III.,pathways up Mont Blanc. How changed are we to-day! Save for the
2234,III.,"voluminous records of the Crimean war, what Mamelons and Malakoffs would"
2235,III.,"the pedestrians, Smith and Jones, be now fighting over, in the _Times_!"
2236,III.,
2237,III.,"Nevertheless, though they made less fuss about it, Englishmen were then,"
2238,III.,"as now, prone to scurrying off to Switzerland in the Autumn--some in the"
2239,III.,true cockney spirit--some because they found there the most sublime of
2240,III.,"all spectacles, together with the most exhilarating exercise for the"
2241,III.,"body, and relaxation of mind in its fullest sense. With myself it"
2242,III.,"amounted to a passion; ""Cuthbert's hobby"" it was dubbed by"
2243,III.,"acquaintances, who could eke out delight from Leamington and Cheltenham."
2244,III.,
2245,III.,"Profiting by the leisure afforded me during successive seasons, I had"
2246,III.,become tolerably familiar with the Alps; with what exquisite and
2247,III.,inexhaustible enjoyment I am not going here to trouble you. But August
2248,III.,"had come round again. The knapsack was stitched, where it wanted"
2249,III.,"mending. The Alpenstock was dragged to light, from the lumber-room. The"
2250,III.,thick-soled gaiter-boots were freshly studded with hobnails. The
2251,III.,"well-worn Swiss map was conned over once more, and a new route, leading"
2252,III.,"over yet untrodden passes, was set down in the Autumnal programme."
2253,III.,
2254,III.,Suddenly I changed my mind--under the influence of an hour's talk with
2255,III.,"an enthusiastic mountaineer--who had, during the previous season,"
2256,III.,"explored the Pyrenees. ""You may not find,"" said he, ""quite so much"
2257,III.,"grandeur; but the valleys are decidedly more picturesque, the foliage"
2258,III.,"more varied, the very tints of the mountains glowing with warmer"
2259,III.,"colours."" Thereupon, a change of plan and passport. Behold me at"
2260,III.,"Cauterets in France, instead of at Grindelwald in Switzerland!"
2261,III.,
2262,III.,"Were my object merely to fill a certain number of pages, I might here"
2263,III.,descant at length upon the comparative beauties of the Alps and the
2264,III.,"Pyrenees--the latter having, at present, the advantage of not being done"
2265,III.,to death by tourists. But I will abstain. I will speak only of one day's
2266,III.,"adventure; the day whereon, for the third and last time, I found myself"
2267,III.,associated with Mary Verner.
2268,III.,
2269,III.,"Cauterets may be a pleasant place enough to those who bathe in, or"
2270,III.,"imbibe for medicinal purposes, the mineral waters that have made its"
2271,III.,"fame. It is finely placed too, pitched in, as it were, into a nook, with"
2272,III.,lofty peaks and fringes of fir forests over-topping its somewhat formal
2273,III.,"streets. It does not, however, offer much attraction to the connoisseur"
2274,III.,in fine scenery. One excursion alone is to be made. Its objects are the
2275,III.,Pont d'Espagne and the Lac de Gaube. The former is a group of pine
2276,III.,trunks bridging a cascade. The latter is a tarn at the foot of the
2277,III.,"glaciers of the Vignemale, which, you know, is one of the"
2278,III.,mountain-monarchs hereabouts.
2279,III.,
2280,III.,"Before proceeding further, I may mention that I am enabled to set down"
2281,III.,"my reminiscences of this particular time and place, by reference to my"
2282,III.,"rough notes penned on the spot, journal-wise. The little memorandum book"
2283,III.,"lies under my hand, with its pages written in ink of various tints, as"
2284,III.,"hotel, or cabaret, or hut furnished the material at the moment. I like"
2285,III.,to preserve these records. Such _souvenirs_ are the _bonnes fortunes_ of
2286,III.,those whose travels are ended. You see that I incline to be sentimental
2287,III.,as I draw towards the _dénouement_ of my story.
2288,III.,
2289,III.,"Heavens and earth, how it rains in the Pyrenees! What a young deluge"
2290,III.,"swept down the steep stone-guttered pavements, on the morning of the"
2291,III.,"29th of August! Still, I did not choose to devote more than one day to"
2292,III.,"the neighbourhood of Cauterets; and so, having made, from my window, a"
2293,III.,"few such profound observations as the one just set down, I ordered a"
2294,III.,"horse and guide. The polite waiter was astonished, and protested, to the"
2295,III.,"extent of two or three ""_Mais Monsieur!_"" The guide thought the storm"
2296,III.,would expend itself in twenty-four hours; but on my hinting that the
2297,III.,"path would not be difficult to find, without his aid, nor"
2298,III.,"impracticable, on foot, he subsided, with an air of conviction, into"
2299,III.,"the accustomed ""_Bien, Monsieur!_"""
2300,III.,
2301,III.,"And so we started. I had borrowed one of the long, thick, hooded Spanish"
2302,III.,"cloaks, commonly used in that region which borders on Spain; and a very"
2303,III.,effectual protection it was against the steady down-pouring of the rain.
2304,III.,"But what is perfect in this world? A German counterpane, on a summer's"
2305,III.,"night, is not more oppressive than was this excellent protection from"
2306,III.,the wet.
2307,III.,
2308,III.,"Handing, then, the heavy encumbrance to the guide, I was drenched to the"
2309,III.,skin in about two minutes. This was a comfort. It settled the point. I
2310,III.,"dislike uncertainty. I could be at my ease, and look about. Remember it"
2311,III.,was yet August.
2312,III.,
2313,III.,"And the Val de Jéret, up which I was riding, was so grandly gloomy; the"
2314,III.,state of the weather excluding all but close views! My note-book thus
2315,III.,"speaks of it, the writer never dreaming that his impressions would be"
2316,III.,"told to the readers of a newspaper, with many of whom Niagara and"
2317,III.,"Montmorenci are familiar sights: ""The valley presents a succession of"
2318,III.,"splendid waterfalls; and, singularly enough, as your route lies upwards,"
2319,III.,"they increase in size and beauty, from the Mahourat, the first, to the"
2320,III.,"Pont d'Espagne, the last and most celebrated. The three intervening,"
2321,III.,"that are dignified with names, are the Cérizet, the Boussé, and the Pas"
2322,III.,"de l'Ours. Besides these, there are an infinity of smaller falls, the"
2323,III.,whole course of the Gave (or torrent) de Marcadaou--along which the path
2324,III.,lies--boiling over broken masses of rock. The eye is charmed by endless
2325,III.,"variety, amid perpetual repetition. The deluge of rain, which covered"
2326,III.,"the lofty rocks on each side of the defile with clouds, had gloriously"
2327,III.,swollen the turbulent waters. I know of nothing in natural scenery--thus
2328,III.,the manuscript rather enthusiastically proceeds--that impresses one so
2329,III.,"forcibly as a cascade of large dimensions. By large I mean broad, not"
2330,III.,"lofty. The effect is apt to diminish, with vast height. These, in the"
2331,III.,"Val de Jéret, I found absolutely bewitching; for is it not a sort of"
2332,III.,"infatuation, by which we are beguiled into drawing nearer and nearer,"
2333,III.,"until you almost touch the foaming sheets as they flurry past, and are"
2334,III.,"yourself driven back, for your pains, half blind and breathless? One"
2335,III.,fine waterfall would be enough to digest in a day. During these two or
2336,III.,"three hours, I had a very feast of them."""
2337,III.,
2338,III.,"If I extract this somewhat rhapsodical passage, it is to show that my"
2339,III.,"inward man was not dampened, by the dampening process externally"
2340,III.,"applied. On the contrary, I am disposed to be jubilant, almost defiant,"
2341,III.,in proportion to the fury of the storm; that is to say when no serious
2342,III.,personal inconvenience is caused by stress of weather. In a mountain
2343,III.,"region too, above all others, clouds play so great a part in the"
2344,III.,"combination of fine effects, that I have many times fairly welcomed a"
2345,III.,tempestuous spell.
2346,III.,
2347,III.,"Thus from the Pont d'Espagne I continued my ride an hour or so further,"
2348,III.,"in order to reach the Lac de Gaube, knowing perfectly well that the"
2349,III.,chances were a hundred to one against my getting a glimpse of the
2350,III.,"glaciers of the Vignemale, at whose feet this small sheet of water is"
2351,III.,"imbedded. Small it may well be termed, for it is not quite three miles"
2352,III.,"in circumference, though the largest lake in the Pyrenees."
2353,III.,
2354,III.,"On the rocky shore where the rough pathway terminates, stands, or stood"
2355,III.,"at the period of which I write, a solitary hut. There, during the short"
2356,III.,"summer season, might be found a family who earned a scanty subsistence,"
2357,III.,by catching the lake trout and serving them up to chance travellers; by
2358,III.,"rowing, in the solitary punt, any one who cared to paddle about the dark"
2359,III.,waters; or by escorting any still more adventurous stranger desirous of
2360,III.,"exploring the glaciers above-named, or ascending the lower heights of"
2361,III.,the Vignemale.
2362,III.,
2363,III.,"Stepping up to the door of this cabin, I entered into conversation with"
2364,III.,"its chief occupant, who probably combined in his own person the various"
2365,III.,"offices of restaurateur, fisherman, muleteer, guide, and smuggler."
2366,III.,Possibly I libel him in the last respect; but along that frontier of
2367,III.,"France and Spain, it is rare to find a mountaineer guiltless of the"
2368,III.,contraband trade.
2369,III.,
2370,III.,"A visitor on such a day was a welcome sight to the poor fellow, who was"
2371,III.,eloquent in regrets that _his_ mountain and _his_ glaciers and _his_
2372,III.,other local points of interest were all wrapped in the impenetrable
2373,III.,"mist. He seemed, I remember now, to care more about it than I did; for I"
2374,III.,"had revelled in the exhibition of cascades, and was rather tickled at"
2375,III.,"the notion of having come up to this lone and savage spot, where nothing"
2376,III.,whatever was to be seen.
2377,III.,
2378,III.,"If a spirit had whispered me, that the moment of my third _rencontre_"
2379,III.,"was close at hand, I should have smiled incredulously."
2380,III.,
2381,III.,The fog lifted. I could see to a distance of half a dozen yards.
2382,III.,
2383,III.,"""What's that?"""
2384,III.,
2385,III.,"""If Monsieur will give himself the trouble of walking up to it, he will"
2386,III.,"see."""
2387,III.,
2388,III.,"It was on a jutting promontory of rock, close at hand. A small enclosure"
2389,III.,"was railed in. It held what was obviously a monumental tablet, in white"
2390,III.,"marble, but discoloured by exposure."
2391,III.,
2392,III.,"""A favourite poodle, perhaps, of the Duchesse de Berri--or one of our"
2393,III.,"eccentric Englishmen doing honour to a Pyrenean bear!"" Such I thought it"
2394,III.,"might be, as I carelessly lounged up to it, and stooped to read the"
2395,III.,inscription.
2396,III.,
2397,III.,It was in French and English. I took no copy of the words. But it was
2398,III.,"placed there in memory of Mr. and Mrs. Easton, drowned in the lake,"
2399,III.,"within one month of their marriage, on the 20th of September, 18--! The"
2400,III.,facts were simply stated. I wish the record of them had been placed a
2401,III.,little further off from the rendezvous of the thoughtless and
2402,III.,light-hearted.
2403,III.,
2404,III.,This was the last of my associations with her. But it would not interest
2405,III.,"the reader, to be told with what feelings of surprise and sorrow I thus"
2406,III.,"learned the close of a career, which bid so fair for happiness and"
2407,III.,usefulness. Poor Mary Verner!
2408,III.,
2409,III.,"Before setting-off on my return to Cauterets, I heard, from the lips of"
2410,III.,"the man with whom I had been conversing, the sad particulars of this"
2411,III.,"harrowing event. Never could the common phrase, that speaks of ""painful"
2412,III.,"curiosity,"" have been more applicable than it was in my case, as I stood"
2413,III.,and listened to him. Poor fellow; he had been an eye-witness. He saw my
2414,III.,"emotion. ""Monsieur knew the young couple?""--thus did he break the thread"
2415,III.,"of his little narrative, more than once."
2416,III.,
2417,III.,I cannot pretend to set down his words. This is the substance of what he
2418,III.,told me.
2419,III.,
2420,III.,"The season was nearly over. The weather was splendidly fine, but very"
2421,III.,cold. Travellers were scarcely expected; when on that brilliant
2422,III.,"September morning, up rode the bride and bridegroom. After resting"
2423,III.,"awhile, they took the single skiff that was there, Mr. Easton offering"
2424,III.,"to row his wife across the lake, to which she very reluctantly assented."
2425,III.,I recollect the narrator dwelling on this fact.
2426,III.,
2427,III.,"The shore shelves off very rapidly. The water, in some parts, reaches to"
2428,III.,the depth of three or four hundred feet. At all times it is of
2429,III.,"marvellous clearness--as I observed myself--and, except during the heats"
2430,III.,"of summer, so piercingly cold, as to be altogether unbearable to the"
2431,III.,swimmer.
2432,III.,
2433,III.,My informant helped them into the boat. Mr. Easton was evidently used to
2434,III.,the handling of oars. The tragedy was immediately--perhaps one should
2435,III.,"say, ostensibly--caused by those two qualities of the water of the Lac"
2436,III.,"de Gaube, to which I have just alluded--its clearness and its coldness."
2437,III.,
2438,III.,The boat was at some considerable distance from the shore. The boatman
2439,III.,"was watching them. Suddenly, Mr. Easton paused in his rowing. He and his"
2440,III.,"wife looked over the side, as though guessing at the depth. Mr. Easton"
2441,III.,"then stood up, and plunged one oar downwards into the water, with the"
2442,III.,confident action of a man who is certain that he shall touch the bottom.
2443,III.,The transparency had deceived him. His oar met no resistance; and he
2444,III.,himself plunged heavily overboard. Such at least was the impression of
2445,III.,the boatman on land; and he could scarcely be mistaken.
2446,III.,
2447,III.,"So far as he could see, Mr. Easton did not rise to the surface. The cold"
2448,III.,"numbed him, and he sunk, not to rise again. The bereaved wife stood"
2449,III.,"upright for a moment in the boat, gazing on the water that had swallowed"
2450,III.,up her husband before her eyes. Then she too was seen to be in it; but
2451,III.,"not one of the two or three, who witnessed the fearful sight, could tell"
2452,III.,"whether she threw herself in, or whether she fell in, senseless. That"
2453,III.,"secret will never be solved; and what matters it to us, though the"
2454,III.,"manner of the widowed wife's death was so remarkable, that I cannot"
2455,III.,"refrain from mentioning it? In talking it over, they agreed that she did"
2456,III.,"not sink at all. As she fell, the water inflated her dress, and she was"
2457,III.,"buoyed-up, floating; though there was no sign of life or movement on her"
2458,III.,"part, observable to the agonized spectators. After a time--I forget"
2459,III.,"whether it was half an hour, or half a day--the remains of what once was"
2460,III.,loved as Mary Verner were wafted tranquilly to the shore. Assistance
2461,III.,"also having been procured, Mr. Easton's body was dragged-up from the"
2462,III.,bottom of the lake. One grave in a church-yard in Essex now holds the
2463,III.,coffins of the ill-fated pair.
2464,III.,
2465,III.,And was there no effort at rescue? Could nothing be done? This idea will
2466,III.,"have crossed the reader's mind. It suggested many questions to me, with"
2467,III.,"which I plied the boatman, who seemed to feel keenly in them the"
2468,III.,bitterness of unintended reproach. But his explanation--grievous as it
2469,III.,"was--was satisfactory. There was no boat, no raft, no means of reaching"
2470,III.,"the spot. ""Two of us,"" said he, ""plunged up to our necks into the water,"
2471,III.,in the irrepressible desire to swim out to them; though we knew that it
2472,III.,"was certain death to go beyond our depth. Besides, Monsieur,"" he added"
2473,III.,"with touching simplicity, ""I can't help fancying that the poor lady was"
2474,III.,dead before she fell out of the boat. Monsieur knew her; doesn't he

2489,I.,
2490,I.,"The Marchioness was at her toilet. Florine and Aspasia, her two"
2491,I.,"ladies'-maids, were busy powdering, as it were with hoar-frost, the"
2492,I.,bewitching widow.
2493,I.,
2494,I.,"She was a widow, this Marchioness, a widow of twenty-three; and wealthy,"
2495,I.,"as very few persons were any longer at the court of Louis XV., her"
2496,I.,godfather.
2497,I.,
2498,I.,"Three-and-twenty years earlier, his Majesty had held her at the"
2499,I.,"baptismal font of the chapel at Marly, and had settled upon her an"
2500,I.,"income of a hundred thousand livres, by way of proving to her father,"
2501,I.,"the Baron Fontevrault, who had saved his life in the battle of Fontenoy,"
2502,I.,"that kings can be grateful, whatever people choose to say to the"
2503,I.,contrary.
2504,I.,
2505,I.,"The Marchioness then was a widow. She resided during the summer, in a"
2506,I.,"charming little chateau, situated half-way up the slope overhanging the"
2507,I.,"water, on the road from Bougival to Saint Germain. Madame Dubarry's"
2508,I.,"estate adjoined hers; and on opening her eyes she could see, without"
2509,I.,"rising, the white gableends and the white-spreading chestnut-trees of"
2510,I.,"Luciennes, perched upon the heights. On this particular day--it was"
2511,I.,"noon--the Marchioness, whilst her attendants dressed her hair and"
2512,I.,"arranged her head-dress with the most exquisite taste, gravely employed"
2513,I.,"herself in tossing up, alternately, a couple of fine oranges, which"
2514,I.,"crossed each other in the air, and then dropped into the white and"
2515,I.,delicate hand that caught them in their fall.
2516,I.,
2517,I.,This sleight-of-hand--which the Marchioness interrupted at times whilst
2518,I.,"she adjusted a beauty-spot on her lip, or cast an impatient glance on"
2519,I.,the crystal clock that told how time was running away with the fair
2520,I.,"widow's precious moments--had lasted for ten minutes, when the"
2521,I.,"folding-doors were thrown open, and a valet, such as one sees now only"
2522,I.,"on the stage announced with pompous voice--""The King!"""
2523,I.,
2524,I.,"Apparently, the Marchioness was accustomed to such visits, for she but"
2525,I.,"half rose from her seat, as she saluted with her most gracious smile the"
2526,I.,personage who entered.
2527,I.,
2528,I.,"It was indeed Louis XV. himself--Louis XV. at sixty-five; but robust,"
2529,I.,"upright, with smiling lip and beaming eye, and jauntily clad in a"
2530,I.,"close-fitting, pearl-grey hunting-suit, that became him to perfection."
2531,I.,"He carried under his arm a handsome fowling-piece, inlaid with"
2532,I.,"mother-of-pearl; a small pouch, intended for ammunition alone, hung over"
2533,I.,his shoulder.
2534,I.,
2535,I.,"The King had come from Luciennes, almost alone, that is but with a"
2536,I.,"Captain of the Guard, the old Marshal de Richelieu, and a single"
2537,I.,"Equerry on foot. He had been amusing himself with quail-shooting,"
2538,I.,"loading his own gun, as was the fashion with his ancestors, the later"
2539,I.,"Valois and the earlier Bourbons. His grandsire, Henry IV., could not"
2540,I.,have been less ceremonious.
2541,I.,
2542,I.,But a shower of hail had surprised him; and his Majesty had no relish
2543,I.,for it. He pretended that the fire of an enemy's battery was less
2544,I.,"disagreeable than those drops of water, so small and so hard, that wet"
2545,I.,"him through, and reminded him of his twinges of rheumatism."
2546,I.,
2547,I.,"Fortunately, he was but a few steps from the gateway of the chateau,"
2548,I.,when the shower commenced. He had come therefore to take shelter with
2549,I.,"his god-daughter, having dismissed his suite, and only keeping with him"
2550,I.,"a magnificent pointer, whose genealogy was fully established by the Duc"
2551,I.,"de Richelieu, and traced back, with a few slips in orthography, directly"
2552,I.,"to Nisus, that celebrated greyhound, given by Charles IX. to his friend"
2553,I.,"Ronsard, the poet."
2554,I.,
2555,I.,"""Good morning, Marchioness,"" said the King, as he entered, putting down"
2556,I.,"his fowling-piece in a corner. ""I have come to ask your hospitality. We"
2557,I.,were caught in a shower at your gate--Richelieu and I. I have packed off
2558,I.,"Richelieu."""
2559,I.,
2560,I.,"""Ah, Sire, that wasn't very kind of you."""
2561,I.,
2562,I.,"""Hush!"" replied the King, in a good-humored tone. ""It's only mid-day;"
2563,I.,"and if the Marshal had forced his way in here at so early an hour, he"
2564,I.,"would have bragged of it every where, this very evening. He is very apt"
2565,I.,"to compromise one, and he is a great coxcomb too, the old Duke. But"
2566,I.,"don't put yourself out of the way, Marchioness. Let Aspasia finish this"
2567,I.,"becoming pile of your head-dress, and Florine spread out with her silver"
2568,I.,knife the scented powder that blends so well with the lilies and the
2569,I.,"roses of your bewitching face.... Why, Marchioness, you are so pretty,"
2570,I.,"one could eat you up!"""
2571,I.,
2572,I.,"""You think me so, Sire?"""
2573,I.,
2574,I.,"""I tell you so every day. Oh, what fine oranges!"""
2575,I.,
2576,I.,"And the King seated himself upon the roomy sofa, by the side of the"
2577,I.,"Marchioness, whose rosy finger-tips he kissed with an infinity of grace."
2578,I.,"Then taking up one of the oranges that he had admired, he proceeded"
2579,I.,leisurely to examine it.
2580,I.,
2581,I.,"""But,"" said he at length, ""what are oranges doing by the side of your"
2582,I.,Chinese powder-box and your scent bottles? Is there any connection
2583,I.,"between this fruit and the maintenance--easy as it is, Marchioness--of"
2584,I.,"your charms?"""
2585,I.,
2586,I.,"""These oranges,"" replied the lady, gravely, ""fulfilled just now, Sire,"
2587,I.,"the functions of destiny."""
2588,I.,
2589,I.,"The King opened wide his eyes, and stroked the long ears of his dog, by"
2590,I.,way of giving the Marchioness time to explain her meaning.
2591,I.,
2592,I.,"""It was the Countess who gave them to me,"" she continued."
2593,I.,
2594,I.,"""Madame Dubarry?"""
2595,I.,
2596,I.,"""Exactly so, Sire."""
2597,I.,
2598,I.,"""A trumpery gift, it seems to me, Marchioness."""
2599,I.,
2600,I.,"""I hold it, on the contrary, to be an important one; since I repeat to"
2601,I.,"your Majesty, that these oranges decide my fate."""
2602,I.,
2603,I.,"""I give it up,"" said the King."
2604,I.,
2605,I.,"""Imagine, Sire; yesterday I found the Countess occupied in tossing her"
2606,I.,"oranges up and down, in this way."" And the Marchioness recommenced her"
2607,I.,game with a skill that cannot be described.
2608,I.,
2609,I.,"""I see,"" said the King; ""she accompanied this singular amusement with"
2610,I.,"the words, 'Up, Choiseul! up, Praslin!' and, on my word, I can fancy how"
2611,I.,"the pair jumped."""
2612,I.,
2613,I.,"""Precisely so, Sire."""
2614,I.,
2615,I.,"""And do you dabble in politics, Marchioness? Have you a fancy for"
2616,I.,"uniting with the Countess, just to mortify my poor ministers?"""
2617,I.,
2618,I.,"""By no means, Sire; for, in place of Monsieur de Choiseul and the Duc de"
2619,I.,"Praslin, I was saying to myself, just now, 'Up, Menneval! up,"
2620,I.,"Beaugency!'"""
2621,I.,
2622,I.,"""Ay, ay,"" returned the King; ""and why the deuce would you have them"
2623,I.,"jumping, those two good-looking gentlemen--Monsieur de Menneval, who is"
2624,I.,"a Croesus, and Monsieur de Beaugency, who is a statesman, and dances the"
2625,I.,"minuet to perfection?"""
2626,I.,
2627,I.,"""I'll tell you,"" said the dame. ""You know, Sire, that Monsieur de"
2628,I.,"Menneval is an accomplished gentleman, a handsome man, a gallant"
2629,I.,"cavalier, an indefatigable dancer, witty as Monsieur Arouet, and longing"
2630,I.,"for nothing so much as to live in the country, on his estate in"
2631,I.,"Touraine, on the banks of the Loire, with the woman whom he loves or"
2632,I.,"will love, far from the court, from grandeur, and from turmoil."""
2633,I.,
2634,I.,"""And, on my life, he's in the right of it,"" quoth the King. ""One does"
2635,I.,"become so wearied at court."""
2636,I.,
2637,I.,"""Aye, and no,"" rejoined the widow as she put on her last beauty-spot...."
2638,I.,"""Nor are you unaware, Sire, that Monsieur de Beaugency is one of the"
2639,I.,"most brilliant courtiers of Marly and Versailles; ambitious, burning"
2640,I.,with zeal for the service of your Majesty; as brave as Monsieur de
2641,I.,"Menneval, and capable of going to the end of the earth ... with the"
2642,I.,"title of Ambassador of the King of France."""
2643,I.,
2644,I.,"""I know that,"" chimed in Louis XV., with a laugh. ""But, alas, I have"
2645,I.,more ambassadors than embassies. My ante-chambers overflow every
2646,I.,"morning."""
2647,I.,
2648,I.,"""Now,"" continued the Marchioness, ""I have been a widow ... these two"
2649,I.,"years past."""
2650,I.,
2651,I.,"""A long time, there's no denying."""
2652,I.,
2653,I.,"""Ah,"" sighed she, ""there's no need to tell me so, Sire. But Monsieur de"
2654,I.,"Menneval loves me ... at least he says so, and I am easily persuaded."""
2655,I.,
2656,I.,"""Very well; then marry Monsieur de Menneval."""
2657,I.,
2658,I.,"""I have thought of it, Sire; and, in truth, I might do much worse. I"
2659,I.,"should like well enough to live in the country, under the willow-trees,"
2660,I.,"on the borders of the river, with a husband, fond, yielding, loving, who"
2661,I.,would detest the philosophers and set some little value on the poets.
2662,I.,"When no external noises disturb the honey-moon, that month, Sire, may be"
2663,I.,"indefinitely prolonged. In the country, you know, one never hears a"
2664,I.,"noise."""
2665,I.,
2666,I.,"""Unless it be the north-wind moaning in the corridor, and the rain"
2667,I.,"pattering on the window-panes."" And the King shivered slightly on his"
2668,I.,sofa.
2669,I.,
2670,I.,"""But,"" added the dame, ""Monsieur de Beaugency loves me equally well."""
2671,I.,
2672,I.,"""Ah, ah! the ambitious man!"""
2673,I.,
2674,I.,"""Ambition does not shut out love, Sire. Monsieur de Beaugency is a"
2675,I.,Marquis; he is twenty-five; he is ambitious--I should like a husband
2676,I.,vastly who was longing to reach high offices of state. Greatness has its
2677,I.,"own particular merit."""
2678,I.,
2679,I.,"""Then marry Monsieur de Beaugency."""
2680,I.,
2681,I.,"""I have thought of that, also; but this poor Monsieur de Menneval.""..."
2682,I.,
2683,I.,"""Very good,"" exclaimed the King, laughing: ""now I see to what purpose"
2684,I.,the oranges are destined. Monsieur de Menneval pleases you; Monsieur de
2685,I.,Beaugency would suit you just as well; and since one can't have more
2686,I.,"than one husband, you make them each jump in turn."""
2687,I.,
2688,I.,"""Just so, Sire. But observe what happens."""
2689,I.,
2690,I.,"""Ah, what does happen?"""
2691,I.,
2692,I.,"""That, unwilling and unable to play unfairly, I take equal pains to"
2693,I.,"catch the two oranges as they come down; and that I catch them both,"
2694,I.,"each time."""
2695,I.,
2696,I.,"""Well, are you willing that I should take part in your game?"""
2697,I.,
2698,I.,"""You, Sire? Ah, what a joke that would be!"""
2699,I.,
2700,I.,"""I am very clumsy, Marchioness. To a certainty, in less than three"
2701,I.,"minutes Beaugency and Menneval, will be rolling on the floor."""
2702,I.,
2703,I.,"""Ah!"" exclaimed the lady; ""and if you have any preference for one or the"
2704,I.,"other?"""
2705,I.,
2706,I.,"""No; we'll do better. Look, I take the two oranges ... you mark them"
2707,I.,"carefully--or, better still, you stick into one of them one of these"
2708,I.,"toilet pins, making up your own mind which of the two is to represent"
2709,I.,"Monsieur de Beaugency, and leaving me, on that point, entirely in the"
2710,I.,"dark. If Monsieur de Beaugency touches the floor, you shall marry his"
2711,I.,"rival; if it happen just otherwise, you shall resign yourself to become"
2712,I.,"an ambassadress."""
2713,I.,
2714,I.,"""Excellent! Now, Sire, let's see the result."""
2715,I.,
2716,I.,The King took the two oranges and plied shuttle with them above his
2717,I.,"head. But at the third pass, the two rolled down upon the embroidered"
2718,I.,"carpet, and the Marchioness broke out into a merry fit of laughter."
2719,I.,
2720,I.,"""I foresaw as much,"" exclaimed his Majesty. ""What a clumsy fellow I am!"""
2721,I.,
2722,I.,"""And we more puzzled than ever, Sire?"""
2723,I.,
2724,I.,"""So we are, Marchioness; but the best thing we can do, is to slice the"
2725,I.,"oranges, sugar them well, and season them with a dash of West India rum."
2726,I.,"Then you can beg me to taste them, and offer me some of those preserved"
2727,I.,cherries and peaches that you put up just as nicely as my daughter
2728,I.,"Adelaide."""
2729,I.,
2730,I.,"""And Monsieur de Menneval? and Monsieur de Beaugency?"" said the"
2731,I.,"Marchioness, in piteous accents. ""How is the question to be settled?"""
2732,I.,
2733,I.,Louis XV. began to cogitate.
2734,I.,
2735,I.,"""Are you quite sure,"" said he, ""that both of them are in love with you?"""
2736,I.,
2737,I.,"""Probably so,"" returned she, with a little coquettish smile, sent back"
2738,I.,to her from the mirror opposite.
2739,I.,
2740,I.,"""And their love is equally strong?"""
2741,I.,
2742,I.,"""I trust so, Sire."""
2743,I.,
2744,I.,"""And I don't believe a word of it."""
2745,I.,
2746,I.,"""Ah!"" said the Marchioness, ""but that is, in truth, a most terrible"
2747,I.,"supposition. Besides, Sire, they are on their way hither."""
2748,I.,
2749,I.,"""Both of them?"""
2750,I.,
2751,I.,"""One after the other: the Marquis at one o'clock precisely; the Baron at"
2752,I.,"two. I promised them my decision to-morrow, on condition that they would"
2753,I.,"pay me a final visit to-day."""
2754,I.,
2755,I.,"As the Marchioness finished, the valet, who had announced the King, came"
2756,I.,"to inform his mistress, that Monsieur de Beaugency was in the"
2757,I.,"drawing-room, and solicited the favour of admission to pay his respects."
2758,I.,
2759,I.,"""Capital!"" said Louis XV., smiling as though he were eighteen; ""show"
2760,I.,"Monsieur de Beaugency in. Marchioness, you will receive him, and tell"
2761,I.,"him the price that you set upon your hand."""
2762,I.,
2763,I.,"""And what is the price, Sire?"""
2764,I.,
2765,I.,"""You must give him the choice--either to renounce you, or to consent to"
2766,I.,"send in to me his resignation of his appointments, in order that he may"
2767,I.,"go and bury himself with his wife on his estate of Courlac, in Poitou,"
2768,I.,"there to live the life of a country gentleman."""
2769,I.,
2770,I.,"""And then, Sire?"""
2771,I.,
2772,I.,"""You will allow him a couple of hours for reflection, and so dismiss"

2774,I.,
2775,I.,"""And in the end?"""
2776,I.,
2777,I.,"""The rest is my concern."" And the King got up, taking his dog and his"
2778,I.,"gun, and concealed himself behind a screen, drawing also a curtain, that"
2779,I.,he might be completely hidden.
2780,I.,
2781,I.,"""What is your intention, Sire?"" asked the Marchioness."
2782,I.,
2783,I.,"""I conceal myself like the kings of Persia, from the eyes of my"

2790,II.,
2791,II.,
2792,II.,"The Marquis was a charming cavalier; tall, slight, with a moustache"
2793,II.,"black and curling upwards, an eye sparkling and intelligent, a Roman"
2794,II.,"nose, an Austrian lip, a firm step, a noble and imposing presence."
2795,II.,
2796,II.,"The Marchioness blushed slightly, at sight of him, but offered him her"
2797,II.,"hand to kiss; and as she begged him by a gesture to be seated, thus"

2799,II.,
2800,II.,"""Decidedly, I believe that the test is useless; it is Monsieur de"

2883,II.,
2884,II.,"""With my whole soul, Marchioness!"""

2887,II.,
2888,II.,"""Every one, Madam."""
2889,II.,
2890,II.,"""That is fortunate indeed; for to be prepared for all, is to accomplish"
2891,II.,"one, without the slightest difficulty; and it is but a single one that I"
2892,II.,"require."""
2893,II.,
2894,II.,"""Oh, speak! Must a throne be conquered?"""
2895,II.,
2896,II.,"""By no means, sir. You must only call to mind that you own a fine"

2899,II.,"""Pooh!"" said Monsieur de Beaugency, ""a shed."""
2900,II.,

2903,II.,
2904,II.,"""For what purpose?"""
2905,II.,
2906,II.,"""To carry me off to Courlac. It is there that your almoner shall unite"
2907,II.,"us, in the chapel, in presence of your domestics and your vassals, our"
2908,II.,"only witnesses."""
2909,II.,
2910,II.,"""A singular whim, Marchioness; but I submit to it."""
2911,II.,
2912,II.,"""Very well. We will set out this evening.... Ah! I forgot."""
2913,II.,
2914,II.,"""What, further?"""
2915,II.,
2916,II.,"""Before starting, you will send in your resignation to the King."""
2917,II.,
2918,II.,Monsieur de Beaugency almost bounded from his seat.
2919,II.,
2920,II.,"""Do you dream of that, Marchioness?"""
2921,II.,
2922,II.,"""Assuredly. You will not, at Courlac, be able to perform your duties at"
2923,II.,"court."""
2924,II.,
2925,II.,"""And on returning?"""
2926,II.,
2927,II.,"""We will not return."""
2928,II.,
2929,II.,"""We will--not--return!"" slowly ejaculated Monsieur de Beaugency. ""Where"
2930,II.,"then shall we proceed?"""
2931,II.,
2932,II.,"""Nowhere. We will remain at Courlac."""
2933,II.,
2934,II.,"""All the winter?"""
2935,II.,
2936,II.,"""And all the summer. I count upon settling myself there, after our"
2937,II.,marriage. I have a horror of the court. I do not like the turmoil.
2938,II.,Grandeur wearies me.... I look forward only to a simple and charming
2939,II.,"country life, to the tranquil and happy existence of the forgotten lady"
2940,II.,of the castle.... What matters it to you? You were ambitious for my
2941,II.,love's sake. I care but little for ambition; you ought to care for it
2942,II.,"still less, since you are in love with me."""
2943,II.,
2944,II.,"""But, Marchioness--"""
2945,II.,
2946,II.,"""Hush! it's a bargain.... Still, for form's sake, I give you one hour to"
2947,II.,"reflect. There, pass out that way; go into the winter drawing-room that"
2948,II.,"you will find at the end of the gallery, and send me your answer upon a"
2949,II.,"leaf of your tablets. I am about to complete my toilet, which I left"
2950,II.,"unfinished, to receive you."""
2951,II.,
2952,II.,"And the Marchioness opened a door, bowed Monsieur de Beaugency into the"
2953,II.,"corridor, and closed the door upon him."
2954,II.,
2955,II.,"""Marchioness,"" cried the King, from his hiding place and through the"
2956,II.,"screen, ""you will offer Monsieur de Menneval the embassy to Prussia,"
2957,II.,"which I promise you for him."""
2958,II.,
2959,II.,"""And you will not emerge from your retreat?"""
2960,II.,
2961,II.,"""Certainly not, Madame; it is far more amusing to remain behind the"
2962,II.,"scenes. One hears all, laughs at one's ease, and is not troubled with"
2963,II.,"saying any thing."""
2964,II.,
2965,II.,It struck two. Monsieur de Menneval was announced. His Majesty remained
2966,II.,"snug, and shammed dead."

2968,II.,
2969,III.,III.
2970,III.,
2971,III.,
2972,III.,"Monsieur de Menneval was, at all points, a cavalier who yielded nothing"
2973,III.,"to his rival, Monsieur de Beaugency. He was fair. He had a blue eye, a"
2974,III.,"broad forehead, a mouth that wore a dreamy expression, and that somewhat"
2975,III.,pensive air which became so well the Troubadours of France in the olden
2976,III.,time.
2977,III.,
2978,III.,We cannot say whether Monsieur de Menneval had perpetrated verse; but he
2979,III.,"loved the poets, the arts, the quiet of the fields, the sunsets, the"
2980,III.,"rosy dawn, the breeze sighing through the foliage, the low and"
2981,III.,"mysterious tones of a harp, sounding at eve from the light bark"
2982,III.,shooting over the blue waters of the Loire--all things in short that
2983,III.,"harmonize with that melodious concert of the heart, which passes by the"
2984,III.,name of love.
2985,III.,
2986,III.,"He was timid, but he passionately loved the beautiful widow; and his"
2987,III.,"dearest dream was of passing his whole life at her feet, in well chosen"
2988,III.,"retirement, far from those envious lookers-on who are ever ready to"
2989,III.,"fling their sarcasms on quiet happiness, and who dissemble their envy"
2990,III.,under cloak of a philosophic scepticism.
2991,III.,
2992,III.,"He trembled, as he entered the Marchioness's boudoir. He remained"
2993,III.,"standing before her, and blushed as he kissed her hand. At length,"
2994,III.,"encouraged by a smile, emboldened by the solemnity of this coveted"
2995,III.,"interview, he spoke to her of his love, with a poetic simplicity and an"
2996,III.,"unpremeditated warmth of heart--the genuine enthusiasm of a priest, who"
2997,III.,has faith in the object of his adoration.
2998,III.,
2999,III.,"And as he spoke, the Marchioness sighed, and said within herself:"
3000,III.,
3001,III.,"""He is right. Love is happiness. Love is to be two indeed, but one at"
3002,III.,"the same time; and to be free from those importunate intermeddlers, the"
3003,III.,"indifference or the mocking attention of the world."""
3004,III.,
3005,III.,"She remembered, however, the advice of the King, and thus addressed the"
3006,III.,Baron:
3007,III.,
3008,III.,"""What will you indeed do, in order to convince me of your affection?"""
3009,III.,
3010,III.,"""All that man can do."""
3011,III.,
3012,III.,"The Baron was less bold than Monsieur de Beaugency, who had talked of"
3013,III.,conquering a throne. He was probably more sincere.
3014,III.,
3015,III.,"""I am ambitious,"" said the widow."
3016,III.,
3017,III.,"""Ah!"" replied Monsieur de Menneval, sorrowfully."
3018,III.,
3019,III.,"""And I would that the man, whom I marry, should aspire to every thing,"
3020,III.,"and achieve every thing."""
3021,III.,
3022,III.,"""I will try so to do, if you wish it."""
3023,III.,
3024,III.,"""Listen; I give you an hour to reflect. I am, you know, the King's"
3025,III.,"god-daughter. I have begged of him an embassy for you."""
3026,III.,
3027,III.,"""Ah!"" said Monsieur de Menneval, with indifference."
3028,III.,
3029,III.,"""He has granted my request. If you love me, you will accept the offer."
3030,III.,"We will be married this evening, and your Excellency the Ambassador to"
3031,III.,Prussia will set off for Berlin immediately after the nuptials. Reflect;
3032,III.,"I grant you an hour."""
3033,III.,
3034,III.,"""It is useless,"" answered Monsieur de Menneval; ""I have no need of"
3035,III.,"reflection, for I love you. Your wishes are my orders: to obey you is my"
3036,III.,"only desire. I accept the embassy."""
3037,III.,
3038,III.,"""Never mind!"" said she, trembling with joy and blushing deeply. ""Pass"
3039,III.,"into the room, wherein you were just now waiting. I must complete my"
3040,III.,"toilet, and I shall then be at your service. I will summon you."""
3041,III.,
3042,III.,"The Marchioness handed out the Baron by the right-hand door, as she had"
3043,III.,handed out the Marquis by the left; and then said to herself:
3044,III.,
3045,III.,"""I shall be prettily embarrassed, if Monsieur de Beaugency should"
3046,III.,"consent to end his days at Courlac!"""
3047,III.,
3048,III.,"Thereupon, the King removed the screen and reappeared."
3049,III.,
3050,III.,"His Majesty stepped quietly to the round table, whereupon he had"
3051,III.,"replaced the oranges, and took up one of them."
3052,III.,
3053,III.,"""Ah!"" exclaimed the Marchioness, ""I perceive, Sire, that you foresee the"
3054,III.,"difficulty that is about to spring up, and go back accordingly to the"
3055,III.,"oranges, in order to settle it."""
3056,III.,
3057,III.,"As his sole reply, Louis XV. took a small ivory handled pen-knife from"
3058,III.,"his waistcoat pocket, made an incision in the rind of the orange, peeled"
3059,III.,"it off very neatly, divided the fruit into two parts, and offered one to"
3060,III.,the astonished Marchioness.
3061,III.,
3062,III.,"""But, Sire, what are you doing?"" was her eager inquiry."
3063,III.,
3064,III.,"""You see that I am eating the orange."""
3065,III.,
3066,III.,"""But--"""
3067,III.,
3068,III.,"""It was of no manner of use to us."""
3069,III.,
3070,III.,"""You have decided then?"""
3071,III.,
3072,III.,"""Unquestionably. Monsieur de Menneval loves you better than Monsieur de"
3073,III.,"Beaugency."""
3074,III.,
3075,III.,"""That is not quite certain yet; let us wait."""
3076,III.,
3077,III.,"""Look,"" said the King, pointing to the valet, who entered with a note"
3078,III.,"from the Marquis, ""You'll soon see."""
3079,III.,
3080,III.,"The widow opened the note, and read:"
3081,III.,
3082,III.,"""Madam, I love you--Heaven is my witness; and to give you up is the"
3083,III.,most cruel of sacrifices. But I am a gentleman. A gentleman belongs to
3084,III.,"the King. My life, my blood are his. I cannot, without forfeit of my"
3085,III.,"loyalty, abandon his service----."""
3086,III.,
3087,III.,"""Et cetera,"" chimed in the King, ""as was observed by the Abbé Fleury, my"
3088,III.,"tutor. Marchioness, call in Monsieur de Menneval."""
3089,III.,
3090,III.,"Monsieur de Menneval entered, and was greatly troubled to see the King"
3091,III.,in the widow's boudoir.
3092,III.,
3093,III.,"""Baron,"" said his Majesty, ""Monsieur de Beaugency was deeply in love"
3094,III.,with the Marchioness; but he was more deeply still in love--since he
3095,III.,"would not renounce it, to please her--with the embassy to Prussia. And"
3096,III.,"you, you love the Marchioness so much better than you love me, that you"
3097,III.,would only enter my service for her sake. This leads me to believe that
3098,III.,"you would be but a lukewarm public servant, and that Monsieur de"
3099,III.,Beaugency will make an excellent ambassador. He will start for Berlin
3100,III.,this evening; and you shall marry the Marchioness. I will be present at
3101,III.,"the ceremony."""
3102,III.,
3103,III.,"""Marchioness,"" whispered Louis XV. in the ear of his god-daughter, ""true"

3107,III.,of the widow in that of the Baron.
3108,III.,
3109,III.,"""I have been making three persons happy: the Marchioness, whose"
3110,III.,"indecision I have relieved; the Baron, who shall marry her; and Monsieur"
3111,III.,"do Beaugency, who will perchance prove a sorry ambassador. In all this,"
3112,III.,"I have only neglected my own interests, for I have been eating the"
3113,III.,oranges without sugar.... And yet they pretend to say that I am a

3138,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3139,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"You remember, perhaps, the bitter cold night and the flurry of a snow"
3140,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"storm, that came abruptly upon us, a few weeks since. That was the time"
3141,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,of which I write--the place was a country village. And what a freezing
3142,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,night it was! The east wind blew gustily and drearily. It was
3143,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"moonlight, but dull and grey; and as I lay in bed, without raising my"
3144,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"head from the starveling bolster vainly eked out by a meagre carpet bag,"
3145,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"I could see a single pine tree, on a steep bank right opposite my"

3150,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"There was no snow yet; but I listened to the rush of each driving blast,"

3173,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Then I knew that it was a balloon. It rose at the instant, and sped"

3235,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,upheaving waves compelled them perilously to embrace each other; and
3236,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,their greeting was as the roar of thunder-storms. And uncouth walrusses
3237,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"were playing their clumsy antics on detached fragments of the ice, and"
3238,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the seal was basking in the sun, and the huge whale was spouting, and"
3239,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the seagull was skimming the surface of the loosened deep, dipping"
3240,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"therein the tips of his wings, as though to assure himself that it was"
3241,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"indeed liquid. Landward, too--for there was land, also, beneath us--I"
3242,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,seemed to see the scanty blades of a dwarfish vegetation thrusting
3243,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,themselves pertinaciously through the snow; and anon the garb of the
3244,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"earth seemed changing from one universal white, to varied hues of brown"
3245,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,and green.
3246,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3247,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Those things and other such, rare and beautiful, were visible to the"
3248,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,bodily eye; but the eye of my mind was not therewith content. It
3249,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"strained its utmost, but saw not what it longed for; and my voice broke"
3250,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"out in bitterness, ""Oh, the ships and the men, the men and the ships,"
3251,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the good Sir John and his daring crews!"""
3252,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3253,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,Then I was conscious that my attendant spirit impelled the balloon in a
3254,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"direction hitherto unexplored, and lo! there beneath us was a ship--a"
3255,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"ship, one of the objects of my search!"
3256,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3257,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,A ship! and my heart bounded within me at the first glimpse I caught of
3258,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"it. But ah! how the blood curdled in my veins, when, at the next moment,"
3259,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"I saw that the ship had not, and could not have occupants. Poor,"
3260,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"ill-fated, ill-treated vessel; never surely did typhoon or whirlwind so"
3261,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,displace thee from thy proper bearings. The troubled waters of the
3262,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Atlantic or the Caribbean Sea might indeed have reared thee upwards, and"
3263,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"plunged thee downwards, and made thee reel to and fro, like a drunkard;"
3264,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"but it was alone the frozen waters of the Arctic, that could have forced"
3265,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"thee into this unnatural position, and then cruelly nailed thee there,"
3266,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,to rot into decay.
3267,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3268,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Ay, stout ship _Erebus_ or _Terror_--I wot not which--there wert thou"
3269,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"lying, or rather there didst thou stand upright, thy bows grovelling in"
3270,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the ice, thy stern uplifted high in air, thy keel propped up against a"
3271,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"sheer precipice of ice, thy bowsprit shivered into splinters, thy masts"
3272,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"and yards, and tackle, fallen all, and tangled in most inextricable"
3273,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,confusion. One stick alone remained set out horizontally from the deck.
3274,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,From it drooped the tattered remnant of a flag; it was the blood-red
3275,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,standard of England!
3276,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3277,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"As the balloon glided downwards towards the wreck, I could have peered"
3278,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,into the after-cabin windows; but a single glance had already satisfied
3279,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,me that no living being would be found on board. I have said that my
3280,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,blood curdled in my veins. Turning hastily with a sudden movement of
3281,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"indignation, I obtained a moment's glance at my guide--his form was"
3282,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"shadowy; but by his hideous features I recognized him as Despair, and"
3283,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,felt that he and I were one.
3284,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3285,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"But ho, a pleasant change! Down we floated, till my tiny car was almost"
3286,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"on a level with the vessel's bows; and there--oh, joy of joys--were"
3287,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"signs, palpable and undoubted, that the crew had fared better than their"
3288,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"ship--that they had escaped, and were gone, and had carried what they"
3289,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,pleased away with them. At one view I comprehended this--I read it in
3290,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the aperture sawn through the doubled planking, and in the fragments of"
3291,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,casks and cases with which the ice was bestrewn around. There was a
3292,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"board, too, with writing upon it, nailed up conspicuously; but I tried"
3293,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"in vain to decipher it. Under the impulse of strong excitement, I again"
3294,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"turned abruptly toward my guide; this time, I could not obtain a glimpse"
3295,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"of him. Methought, however, that I heard a rustle like the sound of"
3296,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"wings, and that the inflated silk over my head became suddenly tinted"
3297,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,with the hues of the rainbow. And so I knew that I was under the
3298,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,guidance of Hope; and that Despair would trouble me no more. Whither my
3299,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"countrymen were gone I could not conjecture; but, at least, I deemed"
3300,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,them safe.
3301,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3302,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,*       *       *       *       *
3303,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3304,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Away, and away, we soared upwards and sped onwards; how far, and how"
3305,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"long, I marked not. And lo, another object! not a ship--it is a house,"
3306,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"this time; yes, a house in the lonely wilderness of that frozen ocean, a"
3307,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,hut upon the waves of that boundless _mer de glace_. And it was
3308,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,fashioned in rude form; and the material was rough blocks of ice; and
3309,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,snow seemed to have been used as their cement. The roof was formed by
3310,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,poles and spars; and across them yet hung a sailcloth covering.
3311,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Roundabout the hut was a lofty wall, built apparently to shelter it from"
3312,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"storms, and snowdrifts; and the wall was built with the same material as"
3313,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the house, for Nature's plentiful quarry fails not in those Polar"
3314,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"regions, if man's hand and man's axe be brought there, to hew and shape."
3315,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"But for whom the shelter, and whither had they gone, who tenanted it? I"
3316,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"knew well that the long lost had been here. None but they--no miserable,"
3317,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,wandering tribe of Esquimaux--could have left such unmistakable marks of
3318,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"forethought, and skill, and energy. Near by, too, was plainly visible"
3319,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the icy cradle wherein a vessel had been lying, and on an even keel. But"
3320,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"ships and men were gone--gone, but how gone, and whither? Earnestly did"
3321,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"I gaze for some solution of this mystery; and at length I solved it, ay,"
3322,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,plain enough; a line along the surface of the ice became distinctly
3323,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"visible, rugged and indented indeed, but straight, and stretching far"
3324,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,away to the Westward. Then was I assured that Sir John and his brave
3325,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"comrades had been here, that they had cut out a channel for their"
3326,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"barque, and that the ice had closed in behind them, so soon as they had"
3327,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"passed on their way. Yes, I was on their track. And again I heard the"
3328,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,soft rustling of the wings of Hope; and the rainbow-tinted hues of the
3329,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,balloon were three-fold more brilliant than before.
3330,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3331,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"One other circumstance only could I note, ere we sped away again upon"
3332,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the search--all who came hither had not departed hence. Side by side, in"
3333,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"a sheltered nook, beneath a towering pinnacle of ice, two wooden"
3334,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"crosses, peering above the snow, told plainly that beneath it two of the"
3335,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,Mariners were sleeping in death. And their names were rudely carved upon
3336,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the crosses; but again my sight, though in some respects preternaturally"
3337,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"sharpened, refused to satisfy my curiosity. Never mind, thought I, 'tis"
3338,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,a small proportion in so large a company. We must all die once; and
3339,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"those who rest here, rest as well as though they were laid beneath the"
3340,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"""long-drawn aisle;"" and their bodies are more enduringly embalmed by the"
3341,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"servants of the great Frost-King, than in olden days they could have"
3342,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,been by the hand of the cunning men of Egypt.
3343,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3344,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,*       *       *       *       *
3345,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3346,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Upwards, and onwards, and steering ever a Westwardly course. And lo, at"
3347,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"length--oh, God be praised--yes I found the men I sought! Yes--no more"
3348,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"doubt--there I saw them below me, although, with the caprice incident to"
3349,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"dreams, I was prevented from dropping down in the midst of them, or"
3350,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,rendering myself either visible or audible.
3351,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3352,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"A strange scene it was, independent of its surpassing interest. Rocky"
3353,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"islands--vast packs and floes of ice--a lone ship beset, impeded,"
3354,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"entangled--a hundred pairs of lusty arms at work with ice-saws and axes,"
3355,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"striving to extricate her, by cutting a channel in the direction where"
3356,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,open water was visible. A little apart from the busy groups stood one
3357,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"whom I instantly recognised as the Chief. Care had furrowed his brow,"
3358,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"and somewhat whitened his locks, and bowed his vigorous form; but manly"
3359,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"resolution was stamped upon his features, and command was in every"
3360,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,gesture. Bethink you how I strove to shout--how I struggled even to
3361,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,throw myself down into their arms; but the dream-spell was on me; I was
3362,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"invisible, perforce, and my tongue refused to give utterance."
3363,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3364,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"How I watched them! and look, the burly seaman who is a few steps ahead"
3365,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"of his comrades, tracking out the pathway to be dug--look, he starts as"
3366,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,though a rattlesnake were issuing from the snow under his feet. What is
3367,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"it? He stoops, and I see his big brown hand tremble, as it assuredly"
3368,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"would not have done, if picking up a burning grenade. What is it, bold"
3369,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"tar, that moves thee thus? Ay, I see now, and know the cause, 'tis"
3370,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,yonder little slip of gay coloured silk on which are printed a few short
3371,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"words. Jack could not read, it was evident enough; but he held up his"
3372,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"prize, and called out something which I could not hear, and his"
3373,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,mess-mates bounded to the spot. Foremost in the race was an athletic
3374,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"young man, in the threadbare uniform of a Midshipman, who had left his"
3375,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"father's halls, five years ago, a beardless boy. Nor was the Chieftain"
3376,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"himself the last. How did it pass rapidly from hand to hand, that little"
3377,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,silken slip! How did its fall amongst them seem to change the whole
3378,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"spirit of the scene! But look again, a gesture from the Chief, not as"
3379,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"one of authority this time, but rather as one of suggestion. It is"
3380,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"obeyed, however, and a hundred heads are bared; and by the movements of"
3381,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"their lips, I could see that every living man amongst them ejaculated a"
3382,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"hearty ""amen"" to the Chieftain's short but earnest thanksgiving to"
3383,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Heaven, for the assistance now known to be at hand. Then I remembered"
3384,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,that the brave Sir John was a pious and a God-fearing man; and that the
3385,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"veriest infidel sneers not at religion in the mouth of him, whose heart"
3386,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,is fearless and true.
3387,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3388,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Visible to me, if not audible, what extravagant demonstrations of joy"
3389,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"ensued! I felt my little car vibrating to their force, as cheers, peal"
3390,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"upon peal, came rolling up into the welkin. Singular was it, too, that"
3391,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"though in my dream my ears were stopped, I could read in the expressive"
3392,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"features of those rejoicing Mariners their varied emotions, as they"
3393,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"vociferated their glee. I could see in their honest countenances, which"
3394,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,cheer was for Old England--which for their Queen--which for their
3395,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,homes--which for their wives and little ones. Then they burst forth into
3396,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"grotesque dancing, and slapping of each others' hands, and jumping on to"
3397,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"each others' backs, and a thousand merry antics, as though they were"
3398,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"children just let loose from school. And anon, in their mirth, running"
3399,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"races hither and thither, one, an officer amongst them, picked up"
3400,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"another printed silken slip, in general aspect like the former, but"
3401,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"addressed, it seemed, to the Chieftain by name. A second look would have"
3402,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"been sufficient to master its contents, but the young man looked not the"
3403,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"second time, he hurried with it straightway to Sir John. Rare instance"
3404,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"this, methought, of the working of a high sense of honour!"
3405,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3406,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"And the veteran, what did it convey to him? I saw not; but I saw a tear"
3407,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,course down his furrowed cheek; and for the moment my ears were opened
3408,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"to hear his half-smothered ejaculation, ""Jane, Jane, God bless"
3409,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"thee--true wife, noble woman--we shall meet, thank God, we shall meet!"""
3410,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3411,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"So I watched the merry throng, and strove in vain to catch portions of"
3412,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"their earnest talk. Suddenly, all eyes were turned upon the Captain; he"
3413,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"was speaking, and pointing to the West. A few words only seemed to come"
3414,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"from his lips; but those surely were words of command. In a moment,"
3415,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"every man, though half delirious with delight, seized upon his axe or"
3416,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,his saw. Work recommenced; labour was distributed in gangs. Every arm
3417,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"was vigorously plied. The watch, descended from the mast-head to hear"
3418,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the wondrous tidings, mounted lustily again to his look-out station."
3419,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,Each man was busy at his post; and though there was perchance some
3420,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"display of increased energy and activity, you would not have surmised"
3421,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,that these patient labourers had just exchanged the gathering gloom of
3422,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Despair for the radiant smiles of Hope. O gallant hearts of oak, thought"
3423,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"I--resolute, unflinching, enduring, in the prospect of the dreariest of"
3424,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"fates--orderly, obedient, loyal, in the thrill of unexpected"
3425,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,deliverance.
3426,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3427,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,*       *       *       *       *
3428,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3429,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,The remainder of my dream came upon me in snatches.
3430,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3431,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Midway in a narrow strait, between lofty and sterile banks, a battered"
3432,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,and crippled barque was steering South. I knew the place to be Behring's
3433,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Straits, the vessel the Discovery Ship that I had just left amidst the"
3434,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"ice. So bruised, however, was she, so rent, and strained, and"
3435,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"maltreated, that but for the friendly aid of a consort's tow-rope, she"
3436,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,could scarcely have adventured even on this comparatively easy
3437,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,navigation. At her peak floated the standard of England; but I strove in
3438,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"vain to make out the colours of her welcome escort. Once, I thought I"
3439,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,saw plainly the Stars and Stripes of America; but these either faded
3440,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"away, or assumed the appearance of the double-headed eagle of Russia. Be"
3441,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"that as it may, my sense of hearing was restored; and I could both hear"
3442,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"and see signs of continuous rejoicing and festivity. Sounds of mirth,"
3443,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"and song, and music, came upwards to me from those pleasant waters."
3444,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Many a canoe, too, filled with outlandish people, visited the ships; all"
3445,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"was wonder, and delight, and congratulation."
3446,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3447,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,*       *       *       *       *
3448,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3449,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,Hitherto there had been some consistency in my dream; for if my mode of
3450,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"seeing were dream-like and fantastical, what I saw had the"
3451,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"verisimilitude of reality. But this was over, or at least was changed."
3452,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"In place of being seated in the car of a balloon, I was now in the"
3453,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"maintop of Sir John's battered and leaky ship, a witness to what could"
3454,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"only have existence in the wild imaginings of a vision. For, methought"
3455,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"we were still steering to the South, when on our larboard hand uprose a"
3456,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"range of lofty hills, upon which it seemed to me that I could almost"
3457,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,have jumped. Down their sides rolled hundreds of little streams; and in
3458,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"the waters, waist-deep, were myriads of human beings, delving, and"
3459,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"scraping, and washing, and picking up what seemed to me to be gold. But"
3460,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"they paused in their busy occupations, when they saw the approach of the"
3461,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"ships; and, holding up shining masses of the golden ore, shouted to the"
3462,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"long missing mariners to come to the mines, and gather a plentiful"
3463,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"harvest after their toils. Yardarm were we to the glittering hill-sides,"
3464,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,and the miners wore the air of men who rarely tempted in vain; but the
3465,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"crew of the worn-out ship gaily shook their heads, laughed a pleasant"
3466,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"little laugh of defiance, and the words, ""home, home,"" came floating up"
3467,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,to me from her deck.
3468,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3469,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,*       *       *       *       *
3470,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,
3471,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Another trial. The men had theirs, and were staunch. It was the master's"
3472,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"turn. Heading still to the southwards, but almost becalmed, I saw a"
3473,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,swift steamer ranging fast up with us from astern. This time the Stars
3474,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,and Stripes were plainly evident. She came alongside. Her captain was on
3475,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"our deck in a moment, and engaged in earnest conversation with the good"
3476,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"Sir John. By the wave of his hand and a word caught here and there, I"
3477,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,knew that the kindly American was pressing the veteran to take passage
3478,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"in his steamer. He drew a little almanac from his pocket, and there"
3479,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"seemed to be some comparison as to dates; but Sir John finally, with a"
3480,A DREAM OF THE ARCTIC SEAS.,"moistened eye, touched the other on the shoulder, pointed upwards to the"

3579,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"""A philosopher had compiled a very large collection of all the tricks"
3580,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"our sex can play; and so, to guard himself against our wiles, he carried"
3581,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"this constantly about him. One day, in travelling, he found himself near"
3582,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"an Arabian encampment. A young woman, sitting under the shade of a"
3583,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"palm-tree, got up suddenly, on the approach of the stranger, and invited"
3584,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,him so obligingly to repose under her tent that he could not resist
3585,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,accepting. The husband of this lady was then absent. The philosopher had
3586,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"scarcely established himself upon the soft carpets, when his graceful"
3587,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,hostess presented him with fresh dates and a vessel full of milk; he
3588,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,could not help seeing the rare perfection of the hands which offered the
3589,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,beverage and the fruit. But to recover from the confusion into which the
3590,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"charms of the young Arabian had thrown him, and whose snares he began to"
3591,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"dread, the wise man drew out his book and read! The enchanting creature,"
3592,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"piqued at this disdain, said to him in the sweetest voice, 'That book"
3593,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"must be very interesting, since it seems to be the only thing you"
3594,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,consider worthy of notice. Would it be an indiscretion to ask the name
3595,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,of the science of which it treats!' The philosopher replied without
3596,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"raising his eyes, 'The subject of this book is beyond the comprehension"
3597,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,of woman.' This refusal excited more and more the curiosity of the young
3598,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,Arabian. She put forward the prettiest little foot that ever left its
3599,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,transient trace upon the fleeting sands of the desert. The sage began to
3600,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,waver; his truant looks would wander toward those dainty feet till his
3601,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"eyes, too powerfully tempted, finally mingled the flame of their"
3602,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,admiration with the fire that darted from the ardent and black orbs of
3603,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"the young Asiatic. Again, then, she asked in her soft low tones, 'what"
3604,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"is the book?' and the charmed philosopher replied, 'I am the author of"
3605,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,this work. It contains a record of all the tricks that woman ever

3607,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,

3615,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,her Eastern eyes she made him forget in one instant his valuable book
3616,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,and its invaluable contents. Behold my philosopher the most impassioned
3617,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,of men!

3619,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"""Thinking that he perceived in the manner of his young hostess a slight"
3620,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"touch of coquetry, the stranger hazarded an avowal of his adoration. How"
3621,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"could he have resisted? The sky was so blue, the sand shone in the"
3622,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"distance like a blade of gold; the wind brought love upon its wings, and"
3623,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,the wife of the absent Arab seemed to reflect all the brilliancy with
3624,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"which she was surrounded. Her bright eyes, too, became liquid; and she"

3635,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"shut it down, locked it, and took the key. She went to meet her spouse,"
3636,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"and after several caresses, which put him into the best of humour, 'I"

3657,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"of her lord, and trembling under the menacing steel of the poniard, she"
3658,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"pointed out the coffer, with a single look, as prompt as it was timid."
3659,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"Then rising, ashamed, she drew the key from her girdle and gave it to"

3662,WOMAN NEVER AT A LOSS.,"his shoulder, 'Iadeste!' she exclaimed; 'at last, I shall have my"

3691,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,indulgence in too frequent cups of Souchong? Perhaps you are
3692,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"endeavouring, in spite of yourself, to solve some knotty problem in"
3693,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"politics, or love, or chess, or mathematics. Perhaps you have a"

3708,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"plenteous store of ""elegant extracts"" garnered up in his memory, and as"
3709,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,though authors specially aimed at being somniferous. There are indeed
3710,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"not a few among them, who unavoidably achieve this distinction; and the"
3711,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"advice might not really be bad, if you could con over--once would be"
3712,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"sufficient--Mr. A.'s last pamphlet on political economy, or the Rev. Mr."
3713,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"B.'s last sermon. On the whole however, inasmuch as your favourite"
3714,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,passages--should you know any of them by heart--may be the very opposite
3715,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"of soothing in their tendencies, this mode of wooing slumber can"
3716,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,scarcely be pronounced successful.
3717,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
3718,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"You must commence, I say, by dreaming, if you would compel yourself"
3719,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,gently to sleep; but before I proceed to introduce to you my list of
3720,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"available prescriptions in this line, I note one with which my readers"
3721,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"may possibly be familiar, having learned it in their school-boy days."
3722,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"You will not now be told for the first time, that a drowsy sensation may"
3723,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"be induced by musing upon--or dreaming of, which is the same thing--a"
3724,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"field of tall and ripe barley, swept by fresh autumnal gales. The rise"
3725,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"and fall of each bowed head, with its feathery and graceful spikes,"
3726,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,combines well with the undulating motion of the whole and the varied
3727,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,play of light and shade. The idea is otherwise expressed by the British
3728,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Laureate in ""The Poet's Song,"" one of his minor pieces; ""and waves of"
3729,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"shadow,"" says he, ""went over the wheat."" Nevertheless it is clear that"
3730,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"he missed the proper application of the thought, for, in place of"
3731,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"lulling the beholder to forgetful repose, the sight seems to have made"
3732,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,him break out into a song so loud that wild swans paused to listen in
3733,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"their flight, larks fluttered down to earth, swallows gave up hunting"
3734,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"bees, snakes slipped under sprays, wild hawks stared over sparrows"
3735,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"stricken under their claws, and the very nightingales were set"
3736,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,a-thinking. Truly a sad perversion this of a golden opportunity! But
3737,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,your rhymsters were ever a crazy race. When they deal with their fellows
3738,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"generally, we all know how they botch poor human nature. What, then, can"
3739,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"be expected, when poets undertake to figure out one of themselves?"
3740,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Still, let us improve the occasion. Barley-fields or wheat-fields are"
3741,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"well enough in their way; only, if you conjure up this image, I would"
3742,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,advise you to season it with an abundance of red poppies intermingled
3743,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"with the legitimate crop, and a very careful attempt on your part to"
3744,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"number these interlopers one by one, preparatory, if so it please you,"
3745,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"to flipping off their heads. With due allowance, therefore, for its lack"
3746,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"of novelty, this dream may be admitted into our collection."
3747,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
3748,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"And it may be proper to remark at the outset that, though the dreams"
3749,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"whereof I propose to treat are sufficiently distinct in their kind, it"
3750,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"is desirable, in the practical use of them, to run them one into"
3751,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"another--to fuse them unconsciously as it were, without being over-nice"
3752,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,as to the point at which one ends and another begins. It is not
3753,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"requisite, however, for this reason, that they should all be packed into"
3754,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"one paragraph, like a daily paper's report of one of Mr. Morrill's"
3755,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"speeches on the Tariff, or a Secretary of the Treasury's Report. You"
3756,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"shall have each dainty conceit served up in its own dish, so that,"
3757,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"furthermore by the way, you can take them in such order as suits your"
3758,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,own good pleasure. This view of the matter relieves me also from the
3759,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,necessity of formal arrangement. It is altogether unimportant which
3760,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,fancy comes uppermost. The main thing is to shut off all thought
3761,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"concerning the actualities of life, eschewing reference to your loves,"
3762,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"your hates, your wrestlings with circumstance, your mental cares, your"
3763,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"bodily ailments. I repeat it: you must dream, if you would sleep."
3764,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Counting the breezy barley-field above mentioned as one, I believe I can"
3765,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,supply you with a dozen subjects.
3766,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
3767,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Your physical eye is closed, of course--your mind's eye being, on that"
3768,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"account, all the more keenly alive to impression, and the better able to"
3769,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"compass an unembarrassed range. Set it, then, upon a spiral stairway"
3770,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"endless so far as I can imagine it, though you may perchance by looking"
3771,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"earnestly upward discover whereto it leads, or by peering intently"
3772,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,downward find out its base. But did I say a stairway? That was not what
3773,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"I meant; and dreamers, of all men, are at liberty to change or modify"
3774,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"their views. I should have said an inclined plane. Let it be steep,"
3775,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"smooth, slippery, broad enough to admit the passage of several figures"
3776,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"simultaneously, and guarded by bannisters on either side. When, fatigued"
3777,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,with the vain attempt to satisfy your doubts as to the safety of this
3778,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"strange structure, your curiosity craves enlightenment as to its uses, I"
3779,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,pray you to observe how I would have it peopled. Sliding tumultuously
3780,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"adown the balustrades, lo and behold an innumerable throng of Cherubs in"
3781,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"unbroken succession, coming whence and going whither you know not, but"
3782,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"each the counterpart of his predecessors, and each flapping his little"
3783,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"wings to maintain his balance, rendered precarious as it is by his"
3784,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,inability to sit a-straddle. As for the inclined plane itself thus
3785,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"fantastically flanked, you soon perceive that it is the _via sacra_ of"
3786,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"many an Ethardo, whom you have known in the flesh or in the"
3787,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"spirit--Ethardo, the marvellous gymnast, who mounted and descended steep"
3788,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"slopes at the Sydenham Crystal Palace, by trundling inflated balls"
3789,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"beneath his feet. Up and down, down and up, some painfully and some"
3790,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"skilfully pediculating, your Ethardi pass and repass each other,"
3791,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,disorderly yet in order. Name them and salute them as they go by. You
3792,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,have probably more acquaintances among them than I; but I recognise
3793,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Robinson Crusoe and Count Bismarck, Tarquinius Priscus and Horace"
3794,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Greeley, John Ruskin and Lucrezia Borgia, Mrs. Fry and Edgar Poe, Mr."
3795,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Gladstone and Dion Boucicault, John Bright and Mrs. Grundy, Ben. Wade"
3796,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"and Victor Hugo, Pio Nono and the Great Mogul. Note, too, the various"
3797,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"material moulded into circular form, and blown up by way of ambulant"
3798,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"footstool; now it is a crown, now a crozier, now a bag of gold, now a"
3799,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"wind-bag, now a woman's heart, now a man's fame done up in a newspaper"
3800,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,and properly puffed. Ring the changes upon these Ethardi and the motive
3801,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"power that each applies, O my wakeful friend; and at least you may lose"
3802,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"sight of your own individuality. Or, take a slide down the banisters"
3803,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"with the young Cherubs, and perchance you may touch bottom--in Lethe."
3804,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
3805,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Not so? Let us proceed. There's a man at our Club, whose reputation is"
3806,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"so solidly built up, though on an ethereal basis, that I never knew any"
3807,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,one presume to question it. He is an absolute master of one
3808,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"accomplishment; unrivalled, and--to the best of my belief, though I"
3809,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,can't vouch for the fact--unenvied. Admiring spectators gather round him
3810,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"and applaud; but, if he have ambitious imitators, they rehearse in"
3811,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"secret. So far, he does well--ay, with consummate tact and unfailing"
3812,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"certainty--what few men can do at all, unless once in a while at dreary"
3813,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"intervals, and then by accident. Not to keep you in suspense, which is"
3814,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"antagonistic to repose and slumber, this young paragon contrives to"
3815,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"throw off his cigar-smoke from his lips, at will, in an unerring series"
3816,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"of the most lovely rings or wreaths, which, as they float and rise in"
3817,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"tremulous succession, strangely fascinate the looker-on. It may be that"
3818,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"this feat is not much of an achievement, morally or physically or"
3819,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,intellectually considered. It may be also that the Club does not do
3820,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"itself much honour, in setting so high a value on this performance. But"
3821,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"what will you? In the palmy days of Greece, a man acquired a certain"
3822,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,celebrity by his precision and address in throwing peas through a
3823,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"needle's eye--the peas being, I presume, much smaller or the needles"
3824,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"much larger, than any with which we sow or make soup in these degenerate"
3825,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"days. Still, so highly do I appreciate perseverance in the acquirement"
3826,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"of any difficult art, that I purpose doing much more for my proficient"
3827,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"in smoke, than was done for his man of peas by Philip of Macedon. That"
3828,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"bushel of ammunition was a scurvy reward. I confer immortality, by thus"
3829,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,registering a fact and hinting a name. And I do this from a sense of
3830,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"gratitude, wherein I trust that you will participate, so soon as you"
3831,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"perceive the connection that may surely be traced, between the smoke"
3832,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"thus artistically and gracefully jetted into air, and the drowsiness by"
3833,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,which you would fain be possessed. Do but imagine a score of your
3834,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"acquaintances round a table, each an adept in this way, and each filling"
3835,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,the atmosphere with coronet after coronet of vapour thrown up from
3836,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"meerschaum or cheroot. Whose are the most frequent, whose the most"
3837,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"perfect, whose retain their form the longest? Watch the little circlets"
3838,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"as they wave and tremble; and award the palm of merit fairly. Nay, even"
3839,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,if you tell me that you are innocent of the weed and nauseated by its
3840,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"odour, none the less shall this fantasy be available. I saw once a"
3841,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"ship-of-war firing a salute; and lo, from one of the guns went up to the"
3842,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"pure sky, in magnified proportions, just such a wreath as those I have"
3843,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"described, as delicate yet as clearly defined, and touched withal with a"
3844,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,suspicion of prismatic colours as it caught the rays of the sun. An
3845,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,enthusiastic painter might have deemed it an invisible Fairy's aureole;
3846,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,a sentimental milliner would have set it down as the flounce of her
3847,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,unseen robe. Whether the gunner of this occasion had taken a lesson from
3848,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"my friend at the Club, I cannot pretend to decide; I only assure you"
3849,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"that I witnessed the phenomenon. You have, therefore, but to multiply as"
3850,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"well as magnify. Think of a squadron, a fleet, all the navies of the"
3851,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"world, sailing slowly and majestically in unending circuit, as the"
3852,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,custom is when they bombard some hapless fort. The saluting is
3853,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,continuous; the movement never ceases; but the big cannon are noiseless
3854,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,now and harmless. Space is joyous with the innumerable wreaths of bluish
3855,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,vapour; but the red slaughter and the accursed tumult of the sea-fight
3856,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"are not heard or seen. Ponder long and lazily, I counsel you, over the"
3857,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,evolutions of the ships and the convolutions of the smoke. Those may
3858,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"lure you, possibly, into the Waters of Oblivion; these may spirit you"
3859,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,away to the land of the Lotos-Eaters.
3860,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
3861,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Another dream invites you; but it must be sketched with more reticence,"
3862,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"and this for two reasons. In the first place, the subject has become"
3863,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,identified with that portion of theatrical entertainments usually found
3864,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"to be the least soporific. In the second place, if your imagination were"
3865,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"encouraged to free range hereupon, you might be foolish enough to"
3866,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,connect its poetic motion and its charm with certain souvenirs of a
3867,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"certain fair friend of yours, whom it were wiser to forget if you desire"
3868,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"to profit by this Mandragorean system. Briefly, then, I commend a"
3869,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Ballet, as not altogether unworthy of trial--but not, be it observed,"
3870,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"that thing of gas lamps, and pink tights, and leers, and _poses"
3871,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"plastiques_, over which young America goes into raptures. By no means."
3872,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Picture to yourself a smooth sward beneath clustered pines, a tender"
3873,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"moonlight, and Nymphs--not semi-nude as is the fashion of our day,"
3874,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,neither affecting the contortions of the gymnast as in our modern
3875,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"caricature of dancing--but robed in swansdown, with nodding plumes and"
3876,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"tasseled fuschias pendent, tripping it, if you will, on ""light fantastic"
3877,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"toe,"" yet through stately and solemn measures. You remember Giulio"
3878,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,Romano's dance of Apollo and the Muses in the Pitti at Florence? Take
3879,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,that for your model; then place the figures to your liking. Nor forget
3880,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,to add an orchestra of Æolian harps. Let them hang among the
3881,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"pine-branches, and sigh forth Weber's Last Waltz, just to set the groups"
3882,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"in motion. Then fail not in your breathings, O soft night-wind; foot it"
3883,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"daintily, ye wildwood Nymphs--so may sleep steal gently upon the"
3884,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"restless one, while yet his ear and eye are unsated!"
3885,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
3886,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Another dream: blue water again, though, this time, with a golden beach."
3887,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"It is calm; but the surf rolls in languidly, with low murmurous sound,"
3888,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"as it will roll, be the sea's surface never so smooth, beyond the"
3889,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"involuntary breakers. What graceful bends and curves are marked, for an"
3890,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"instant, with frothy pencil, upon the shining sands! How they sparkle"
3891,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,with evanescent light! How soon the tiny bubbles disappear! But you have
3892,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"watched all this, many and many a time; and stale indeed hereon were"
3893,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"description and moralizing! Why, then, this present allusion? What is"
3894,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"there in it, tending to lull the acuter sensibilities? What offers it of"
3895,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,gently-soothing exercise to the overwrought and throbbing brain? This is
3896,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"the reply. Popular belief gives to every ninth or tenth wave, tumbling"
3897,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"in upon the shore, supremacy over its fellows. It swells up into fuller"
3898,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,volume. It sweeps landward with a more majestic force. This is the
3899,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"story; but I would have you test its correctness. Is it the ninth, or"
3900,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"the tenth? So, lie down yonder upon the mass of dry sea-weed piled"
3901,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"against the rocks, and count patiently a dozen, a score, a hundred, a"
3902,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"thousand waves as they come in. You shall tell me, to-morrow morning,"
3903,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"whether the ninth have it, or the tenth--whether there be any regularity"
3904,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,at all.
3905,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
3906,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Again: if we do not, like the Roman Augurs, watch and interpret the"
3907,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"flight of birds as of good or evil omen, some of them--I mean some of"
3908,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"the birds, not of the Augurs--may help us to become, for a while,"
3909,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"independent of fate and fortune. Did you ever, for instance, sit at a"
3910,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"window on a summer's evening, and take note how a flight of swallows"
3911,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"skims the air? They are not very numerous, perhaps; but as they dart to"
3912,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"and fro, and cross and recross before you, their number appears"
3913,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"indefinite, and the zigzag peculiarity of their movements can only be"
3914,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,verified by the closest possible scrutiny. I have satisfied myself that
3915,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"the motion is regular, and that it describes an elongated figure of 8,"
3916,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,traced as I am sure you have often traced it upon ice with the outer
3917,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"edge of your skates. Now, though I tell you this on the faith of my own"
3918,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"personal observation, you are not bound to accept my word for it. Dream"
3919,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"therefore that, while you are blending two ovals into one figure upon"
3920,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"the frozen pond, swallows overhead are keeping time to your gyrations."
3921,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"The winter sport and the summer bird may be made to harmonize, as it is"
3922,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,only in a dream; and close watching will enable you hereafter to support
3923,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,or disavow my theory.
3924,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
3925,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Again: return, if you please, from air to water, for you have by no"
3926,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"means exhausted the resources of this latter element, in the way of"
3927,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,material for dreams. Are you an angler? Did you never drowse and doze
3928,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"over your rod, when ""sitting in a pleasant shade,"" on a sultry"
3929,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"afternoon, not a nibble disturbed the equanimity of your float? The mere"
3930,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"thought were suggestive of a nap--suggestive, that is, to the indolently"
3931,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"disposed, with whom however you may not be classed, seeing that your"
3932,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"mind is in a state of unwholesome excitement, the which it is my"
3933,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"business to allay. And so, I pray you, look deeper into this matter; pry"
3934,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"down into the blue transparent depths, and mark the fish that swarm"
3935,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"about your hook. Is it paste thereon, or a wriggling worm? Never mind;"
3936,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,the bait is singularly attractive. To say nothing of the float gently
3937,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"bobbing ever and anon, and of the tell-tale ripples rising to the"
3938,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"surface, you can see with your own eyes how victims dally with"
3939,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"temptation; how they course to and fro, and round and round; how one"
3940,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"eyes the bait, and another smells it, and another mumbles it; how one"
3941,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"swims away, and presently returns, and with him his mate in size and"
3942,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"colour. Are they over-fed or over-cautious, that they thus play round,"
3943,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,but will not gorge? Does one egg on his brother to try the suspicious
3944,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"morsel, hoping himself to profit by his brother's experience? Is there"
3945,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"so much resemblance to human foibles discernible down there, among these"
3946,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,poor little inhabitants of the waters under the Earth? The question is
3947,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"worth studying out--especially by a sleepless man, who, while"
3948,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"contemplating the forms, the motions, the manners, and the minds of"
3949,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"fish, may unconsciously swallow the bait that is thus dropped before"
3950,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,him.
3951,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
3952,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,It was my intention to devote a long and distinct paragraph to each of
3953,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"four other subjects, that appear to me no less adapted for the"
3954,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"consideration of waking dreamers. These are, respectively, Ghosts,"
3955,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Labyrinths, Regattas, and the Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne. But it"
3956,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,is well to leave something to the reader's perspicacity and inventive
3957,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"powers. Indeed, why should he not fancy--dream is the more appropriate"
3958,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,term--that he himself has undertaken to complete these special
3959,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"paragraphs? Let his imaginary pen glide, swift and effortless, over his"
3960,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"imaginary foolscap. Ten to one, he will fill in and elaborate my"
3961,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"outlines, far better than I could work them out myself. For instance, I"
3962,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"do but mention Ghosts; he might summon to his presence, and bid troop"
3963,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"before him, hosts upon hosts of his friends or relatives, or of his"
3964,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,chosen heroes and heroines in romance and history. He might clothe them
3965,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,in white or in grey; he might attire them in their ordinary habiliments;
3966,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"in short, he might parade them according to his own taste, without"
3967,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"reference to mine, which whould be a clear point in his favour."
3968,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Accidentally, I might call up some spirit that had vexed and thwarted"
3969,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"him through life, for no man whose experience is worth remembering hath"
3970,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"not had his enemies, hidden or revealed, and very few are the men, fewer"
3971,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"the women, who have never disposed of a rival. My reader of the moment,"
3972,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"invested with my functions, will of course evoke none but his familiars,"
3973,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"the well-bred and well-behaved. Let me be grateful accordingly that, by"
3974,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"transferring the responsibility to him, I escape the chance of bringing"
3975,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"forward, innocently and inopportunely, some social Banquo. And so I pass"
3976,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"on, with one single word of caution to my substitute in completing this"
3977,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,paragraph: let him not convert his pen into a Pre-Raphaelitish
3978,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,paint-brush. Airy beings must be rather hinted than described. The
3979,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"realism of anatomical plates, applied to them, would spoil the reader's"
3980,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"dream _in toto_, and wake him up perhaps more hopelessly than ever.--As"
3981,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"to Labyrinths, the course is obvious. Take a dozen of these quaint"
3982,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"contrivances, and place them side by side, as Paulsen or Paul Morphy may"
3983,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"place the sundry chess-boards whereat he is to play, simultaneously and"
3984,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"blindfolded, an equivalent number of games. Pop, over the hedges and"
3985,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"into the very core of each one, any personage against whom you have a"
3986,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"grudge, or any one of the Ghosts just convened that may have been"
3987,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,troublesome; and then challenge the incarcerated individuals to find
3988,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"their way out of limbo, by the gravelled pathways. Should one of the"
3989,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"whole number emerge, through extraordinary good luck, quietly tip him"
3990,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"back again over the hedge, or defy him to retrace his steps and regain"
3991,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"the centre. You may enlarge this suggestion, I think, into a paragraph"
3992,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,reasonably long.--The same with Regattas. I am almost sorry that I gave
3993,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,up to you so felicitous a topic; for all ages and all waters may be laid
3994,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,under contribution. From Noah's Ark shall float the commodore's broad
3995,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"pendant. The ocean shall be covered, so far as eye can range, with"
3996,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,countless craft of every build and rig. And all shall glide about in
3997,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"quiet, inasmuch as oars shall be muffled, and steamers, having learned"
3998,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"to consume their own smoke, shall be taught equally to swallow their"
3999,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,hideous noises. The marshalling of the competitors and the order of the
4000,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,racing are left to your discretion; but there need be no lack of
4001,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,interest. Caiques from Stamboul and gondolas from Venice shall be
4002,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,frequent; and pirogues from the Malayan peninsula shall over-haul the
4003,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,three trim yacht-schooners that raced across the Atlantic from New-York.
4004,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,Here Cleopatra's barge shall be matched against an Esquimaux kayak;
4005,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,there a catamaran from Coringa shall bump the Yale College eight. If
4006,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"you cannot make something out of all this picturesque confusion, and if"
4007,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,you cannot contrive to lose therein both yourself and the reader of your
4008,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"paragraph, the fault will be yours, not mine.--There remain the Eleven"
4009,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,Thousand Virgins of Cologne. What are you to do with them? Simply this.
4010,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,Endow each one of them with personal attributes; let each have form and
4011,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"features, distinct from the others of her sisterhood. Is the task"
4012,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,difficult? So much the better. After a cool thousand or so of these
4013,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"individual portraitures, you may begin to fumble in vain for separate"
4014,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"identities. In fact, who knows whether you may not be compelled to take"
4015,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"refuge hopelessly in sleep, the very mark at which both of us are"
4016,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,aiming?

4018,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"And now, the foregoing long and subdivided paragraph being brought at"
4019,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"last to an end, it were disingenuous to shirk an admission, that the"
4020,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"""who's who"" is not so plainly discernible therein as it might be. You"
4021,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"and I, and the reader and the writer, and the giver and recipient of"
4022,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"advice, will be accused by the critic of being somewhat queerly mixed"
4023,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"up. What, then? Are not vagueness and uncertainty of style specially"
4024,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"appropriate to the circumstances? Who would thank us for precision? No,"
4025,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"no; carry clearness, if you like, into your mathematical definitions;"
4026,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"but leave us our mistiness when we treat of the mysterious. Nor, on the"
4027,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"whole, am I otherwise than content with my suggested assumption of"
4028,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"temporary and imaginary authorship, as one of the methods for quieting"
4029,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,a fevered brain. How pleasant to dream that rival Publishers are
4030,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,contending for your manuscript poems; that rival Managers are waylaying
4031,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"you for a sight of your unwritten comedy! Besides, by adding authorship"
4032,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"to the list that closed with the damsels of Cologne, the number is"
4033,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"brought up to eleven, so that, when I wind up with my trump card, the"
4034,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"promised dozen of dreams will be complete, and I shall be enabled to"
4035,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"dispense with the ""waves of shadow"" on the wheat-field, which I"
4036,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,acknowledged were not my original conception.
4037,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,
4038,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,But am I too late in bringing forward my last and happiest idea?--though
4039,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"for that matter, when the tale of Mazeppa was concluded, ""the King had"
4040,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"been an hour asleep,"" and yet Mazeppa's story was told out ne'ertheless."
4041,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"For your immediate purpose therefore, or for use on your next sleepless"
4042,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"night, I entrust you with the crowning opiate. Recollect that you are"
4043,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"dreaming; and dream that all your intimates and relatives, all of whom"
4044,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"you have ever heard or read with interest, men and women and children,"
4045,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"people of every age and clime--imagine them, I say, all seated before"
4046,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,you at a round table. How any table is to accommodate so vast a
4047,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"multitude, is their affair, and yours; the dreamer is never baulked by"
4048,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,technical impediments. Have your eye upon them all at once--another
4049,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"little difficulty, to be overcome only by mortals in the incipient stage"
4050,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"of somnolency. Or, if your mind's eye obstinately refuses to enlarge its"
4051,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"orbit in this direction, so as to embrace such a vast and heterogeneous"
4052,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"assemblage, gather, I beseech you, into one focus any such crowd as you"
4053,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,habitually see. The Sunday audience of the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher
4054,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,will answer the purpose; or you may fancy yourself at one of the old
4055,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"Tammany Hall Meetings; or at the Opera, on a fashionable night; or in"
4056,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,the Senate at Washington during the impeachment of Mr. Johnson. It
4057,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,matters not when and where; but the proceedings strike you as
4058,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"insufferably dull, and you give vent to your feelings in a yawn that may"
4059,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"neither be suppressed nor concealed. Suddenly, moved by the same impulse"
4060,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"and unable also to control or hide its effect, the jaw of every soul"
4061,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"present is dropped to the lowermost, and all mouths are open in a"
4062,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"universal yawn. It is not catching; it is caught. Beecher gapes, and the"
4063,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"elect are gaping round him. Isaiah Rynders the same, and the same with"
4064,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"his ""unterrified"" hearers. Parepa-Rosa stands open-mouthed in dumb show"
4065,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"of singing, while humming-birds perched on chignons vibrate, as they"
4066,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"vainly try to resist the irresistible. Gape the Republicans, and gape"
4067,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"the Democrats, in response to the gaping Butler on his legs. There is,"
4068,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,in Shakespeare's words--though his ignorant editors have transformed it
4069,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"into a ""gap""--there is, I say, ""a gape in Nature."" Will you alone hold"
4070,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"out: I can't believe it. You have yawned in concert, I am morally"
4071,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"certain. Indeed, if, as these long-drawn prescriptions come to an end,"
4072,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,"you be not far on the road to forgetfulness, I can give you but one"
4073,MANDRAGORA--BY THE DOZEN.,parting counsel. Nothing else can serve and save you--you must

4087,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"as the subject of it is a remarkable personage, and this unexpected"
4088,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,meeting with him in print has revived in us not a few pleasant
4089,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"recollections, we will take the liberty of informing our readers how we"
4090,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"came to have personal knowledge of Don Pablo--for this, and not Doctor"
4091,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Pablo, was his cognomen, at least amongst his friends."
4092,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,
4093,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Embarking at Bombay, many a long year since, in the East India Company's"
4094,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"steamer _Atalanta_, for passage up the Red Sea, we soon fell into"
4095,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"acquaintance with a party of foreigners, partially isolated as they were"
4096,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"from the crowd of Anglo-Indians--men, women, and children--returning by"
4097,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,the over-land route to their native country. They (the foreigners) were
4098,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"five in number, two Frenchmen, two Dutchmen, and a Spaniard. Of the"
4099,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"three last-mentioned we have small recollection. Of the Frenchmen, one"
4100,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,was Don Pablo.
4101,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,
4102,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"The other, who headed the whole party, was Monsieur Adolphe Barrot, a"
4103,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"brother of Odilon and Ferdinand Barrot, whose names are familiar to"
4104,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,those conversant with recent French history. He was at the time bound to
4105,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Paris, on leave, from his post of Consul-General at Manilla. At an early"
4106,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,period of his career he had been attached to the French Legation at
4107,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Washington, or at least had travelled through this country."
4108,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Subsequently, when Consul at Carthagena, he distinguished himself by his"
4109,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,resolute and humane interposition on occasion of a certain revolutionary
4110,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"outbreak. After his return from the East, he served as French Minister"
4111,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"to Naples and to Lisbon, and now, we believe, holds the same appointment"
4112,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"at Brussels. Between this man of cultivated mind, polished manners, and"
4113,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"companionable qualities, and Don Pablo, whose exterior smacked but"
4114,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"little of intercourse with ""the world,"" there was evidently a bond of no"
4115,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"common sort. Blunt, earnest, truthful, with quick perceptions and"
4116,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"impulses of the kindest nature, there was something very fresh and"
4117,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,irresistibly attractive in the character of Don Pablo. We did not wonder
4118,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,at the intimacy. Opposites are drawn together. In friendly and social
4119,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,intercourse the time sped away.
4120,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,
4121,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"At that period, the steamers bound from Bombay to Suez touched at"
4122,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Cosseir, a port two days' sail South of Suez, and about 150 miles East"
4123,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,of Thebes on the Nile. The object was to land passengers who cared to
4124,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"cross the intervening Desert, as the quickest mode of gaining Upper"
4125,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,Egypt. To Cosseir we were ourselves destined; our new friends being on
4126,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"their way direct to France, _viâ_ Suez, Cairo, and the Mediterranean,"
4127,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,and having made none of the ordinary provision for the less-frequented
4128,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"route. But we plied them strongly with argument and entreaty, to divert"
4129,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,them from their intended limited course; not forgetting the threat of
4130,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"ridicule in a Parisian drawing-room, where a man who had missed such a"
4131,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"chance would never be able to hold up his head. Finally, they consented."
4132,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"After a voyage of sixteen days, the coaling process at Aden included,"
4133,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,three groups of travellers landed at Cosseir. We had dealings with two
4134,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,of them.
4135,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,
4136,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"For although we had persuaded Mr. Barrot, Don Pablo and their"
4137,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"associates, to take our route, we could not precisely undertake to"
4138,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"accompany them. We were to travel over the same ground, but not"
4139,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"together; for we had engaged, ere we left Bombay, to join fortunes with"
4140,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,a small party of veterans and valetudinarians who had made elaborate
4141,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"preparations for the journey, and were not sorry to have the aid of one"
4142,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"who did not belong to either class, but who was perhaps for that very"
4143,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,reason more competent than they themselves to take charge of their
4144,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"caravan. And then there was a lady, and a lady's maid, and a valet, and"
4145,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,the thousand and one encumbrances that are incidental to such
4146,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,appendages. What scenes we had with the camel-drivers! What tons of
4147,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,baggage to be loaded! what irritations! what drollery! what delay!
4148,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Landing early in the morning, the preparations for a start occupied us"
4149,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,till a late hour in the afternoon; nor had we ever a more laboursome
4150,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"time of it. Lightly cumbered, and with only a twentieth part of the"
4151,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"fuss, Don Pablo and the others had preceded us; but as the same"
4152,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"camping-places in this five days' journey are generally frequented, we"
4153,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,hoped to see them from time to time. Fortune kindly ordained that we
4154,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,should join them permanently.
4155,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,
4156,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"It was on a Saturday afternoon that we started from Cosseir, with a"
4157,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"train ""too numerous to mention."" Night had fallen, ere we pitched our"
4158,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,tents--the writer sharing that of Sir C. M. At day-light on the
4159,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"following morning, we strolled off to the French encampment; were again"
4160,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,pressed to join its occupants; were again compelled reluctantly to
4161,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"refuse. Away they went. We returned to our own quarters, where to our"
4162,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"horror, in place of hearing ""boot and saddle"" sounded, the edict was"
4163,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"issued from my lady's tent, that there was to be no marching that day."
4164,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,Bah! how provoking! we could not ask for an honourable discharge; but
4165,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"how we longed to desert! Matters fell out, however, more pleasantly then"
4166,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"we had a right to expect. Breakfast was served, with the elaborateness"
4167,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"of a _fête champêtre_, at eleven o'clock; and as the hostess gracefully"
4168,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"poured out the coffee, the talk turned upon those who had sped onward."
4169,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Presently, by a lucky chance, it occured to her, or to the nominal head"
4170,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"of the party, that dawdling away a Sunday on a barren speck of"
4171,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,Mahommedan sand was not in itself the essential duty of a plain
4172,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Christian, nor specially agreeable to a man whose thoughts were keenly"
4173,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"set upon the marvels of Luxor and Karnac. In short, it was mildly"
4174,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"suggested to us that, as the organization and first move of the"
4175,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"caravan--the real and only difficulties--were accomplished, there would"
4176,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,be nothing ungallant in leaving the party to its more orthodox or more
4177,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,leisurely progress. Our coyness may be imagined; but we consented at
4178,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"length to take this view of the matter, and at noon called up our"
4179,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,camels. Soon were our trunks and slender stock of kettles and sauce-pans
4180,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"slung upon one; ourselves astride of a second; and on a third, the Arab"
4181,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"driver, with whom there was no communicating but by signs. A twelve"
4182,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,hours' ride brought us at midnight to the tent of our friends--they
4183,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,having luckily found one available at Cosseir. We raised the canvas from
4184,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"the pegs, and saluted Don Pablo with a ""Here I am!"" Many years have"
4185,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"elapsed since that night, but we can fancy now that we hear his genial"
4186,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"rejoinder, ""I knew you'd come!"" In less time than it takes to tell it,"
4187,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"we had edged in our bedding upon the sand, and were one of the"
4188,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Seven--no, six--Sleepers."
4189,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,
4190,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,Had not a _Howadji_ of this Western hemisphere made the Desert and the
4191,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Nile so peculiarly his own, that it is presumption for a common pen to"
4192,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"follow in his track, we might be tempted still further to ransack our"
4193,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"memory for pleasant recollections of Don Pablo. Let it suffice to say,"
4194,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,that with these pleasant companions we roughed it across the
4195,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"camel-track, in a style of discomfort and good humour rarely surpassed;"
4196,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,explored the wonders of Thebes and the Tombs of the Kings; floated down
4197,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,to Cairo; clambered the Great Pyramid; smoked pipes with Pashas; and
4198,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"finally embarked at Alexandria, on the blue waters of the"
4199,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Mediterranean. The farewell was said at Syra, one of the islands of the"
4200,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Ægean. The ""five we supped with yesternight"" were bound to Malta and"
4201,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,Marseilles--we to Athens and Constantinople. As we shook hands at
4202,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"parting with Don Pablo, he quietly remarked, with that cheerful gravity"
4203,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"that so well became him, and in allusion to a young lady who had been"
4204,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"our three days' acquaintance on board the steamer--""_Adieu, mon cher;"
4205,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"vous épouserez Mademoiselle._"""
4206,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,
4207,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"We never saw Don Pablo, but once afterwards. Several months had elapsed."
4208,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"His prophecy had been fulfilled. The lady in question was on our arm, as"
4209,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"in sauntering under the arcades of the Palais Royale in Paris, we met"
4210,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,our old associate. There was a hearty greeting; but when we reminded him
4211,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"of his prediction and formally introduced him, we remember that he cut"
4212,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"the colloquy abruptly short (as it then seemed to us), and turned away"
4213,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"with an expression of face for which we were at a loss to account, being"
4214,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,ignorant of all the details of his history. Did the memory of the
4215,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"Peninsula of Iala-Iala, and of the loving wife whom he had buried there,"
4216,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,fall too suddenly and too sadly upon his sensitive and affectionate
4217,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,spirit?--We cannot say; but this was the beginning and the ending of our
4218,DOCTOR PABLO'S PREDICTION.,"knowledge of Doctor Pablo, until we unexpectedly met him in print."

4226,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,It is not very much of a walk from the Glen House up the Eastern face of
4227,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,Mount Washington--less than three hours at a leisurely pace will
4228,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,accomplish it; and on a fine day it would be next to impossible to lose
4229,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"one's-self, if alone. Half the distance or thereabouts, your track lies"
4230,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"through a wood, acceptable enough as offering shelter from a July sun,"
4231,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"but curtailing your views annoyingly. However, all things end; and if"
4232,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"your range of sight be somewhat ""cabined, cribbed, confined,"" at the"
4233,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"start, you have no cause for complaint on that score after once emerging"
4234,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"from covert, for the rocks, bleak, bare, and irregular, that are"
4235,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"scattered all around, though large enough to compel a careful picking of"
4236,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,the way between them by no means limit the vision. But the approach has
4237,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"been a hundred times described, and I will only say of it, at the risk"
4238,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"of repetition, that he who comes up from the Glen House, and fails to"
4239,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"turn his eye continually over his right shoulder, to dwell lovingly upon"
4240,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"the near and noble outlines of Mounts Jefferson, Adams, and Madison, has"
4241,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,no appreciation of this sort of scenery.
4242,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,
4243,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"The morning had been superlatively fine, and troops of mounted dames"
4244,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,and damsels and cavaliers made the various pathways lively with their
4245,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,glee. But caprice is the rule of these high regions; and when I was
4246,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"within ten minutes of the summit, clouds of misty vapour came suddenly"
4247,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"scudding up, whence I knew not, but shutting out a peep here and a vista"
4248,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"there, as they caracolled in fantastic evolutions. Presently, to these"
4249,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,kaleidoscopic effects succeeded a slight hailstorm--it was rain visibly
4250,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"beneath us, attended with thunder and lightning--but anon all was"
4251,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"comparatively clear again, and from the congregated spectators went up"
4252,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"many a genuine burst of enthusiastic admiration, as point after point"
4253,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,opened out or was shut in by the scud.

4255,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,The two rough stone buildings upon the small plateau that crowns the
4256,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"mountain, built for the accommodation of travellers, are called"
4257,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"respectively the ""Summit"" and the ""Tip-top"" House. Once rivals, they now"
4258,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"form a single establishment--one being used as a restaurant, the other"
4259,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"as a dormitory. On this particular day, nearly a hundred persons must"
4260,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,have refreshed themselves in the former--a dozen or fifteen in the
4261,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"latter; and I must own, it was not without a sense of relief that I saw"
4262,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"the last of the descending parties set forth about 2 P. M., being myself"
4263,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,of the select few about to take the chance of sunset and sunrise.
4264,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,
4265,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"For the afternoon, then--for the interval of time was to be occupied--a"
4266,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"guide was summoned, to show half-a-dozen of us the wonders of"
4267,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"Tuckerman's Ravine, a _cul-de-sac_ between two great buttresses of"
4268,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"Mount Washington, that prop it up towards the South and West. The sides"
4269,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,of this ravine are very precipitous the head of it being formed of
4270,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"layers of rock, at an angle of about ninety-five degrees, over which a"
4271,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"cascade precipitates itself, fed by the springs and melted snows above."
4272,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"In the bed of this hollow, to which the descent is sufficiently sharp to"
4273,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"gratify the keenest amateur pedestrian, the accumulated snow of the"
4274,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"winter, blown over from the impending heights, lies packed in such"
4275,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,enormous masses that it seldom entirely disappears until the latter part
4276,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"of August. At the period of my visit, on Friday, the 29th of July, a"
4277,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"huge portion thereof remained, and the famous ""Snow-Arch"" was not only"
4278,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,visible but practicable. This natural curiosity is a cave channelled out
4279,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"from the vast snow bank as a passage for the descending waters, the roof"
4280,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"of which, gradually melting away, leaves height and space for walking"
4281,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,along this gallery as it were in the very bed of the torrent. You enter
4282,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"perforce, be it observed, where the stream emerges. The length was"
4283,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"certainly not less than two hundred feet, the breadth of the tunnel"
4284,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"perhaps forty or fifty. Of the thickness of the roof I cannot speak, not"
4285,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,having essayed it; but the little knot of adventurers trusted that it
4286,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"would not cave-in whilst they were groping their difficult way, one"
4287,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"after the other, wet-footed and in semi-obscurity, up-stream, from end"
4288,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,to end of the arched way. The object of the exploration it would be
4289,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,difficult to define. It certainly was not scientific; it offered no
4290,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"rare beauties; it might have been very well imagined, without the"
4291,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"trouble and subsequent risk--but it was an adventure, and it had its"
4292,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,charm. Day-light appeared as we neared the waterfall--luckily not very
4293,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"full--which, as I have already said, comes down the head of the ravine"
4294,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"and is the origin of the ""Arch"" itself. What next? The snow had"
4295,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,separated bodily from the face of the rocks to the width of two or three
4296,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"feet, as you see ice fields in a thaw detach themselves from the land"
4297,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"whereto they have been joined. We could therefore emerge, and clamber up"
4298,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"the abrupt face of the rocks, though the first start was not inviting,"
4299,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,inasmuch as we had to hoist ourselves up by unequal pressure upon soft
4300,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,snow on one side and hard rock on the other. The alternative was a
4301,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,return. This would have been inglorious; up we went. It was a rough
4302,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"business. The guide had been over the ground once before, this"
4303,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"season--so he said, at least--but he ""harked back"" occasionally, as"
4304,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,though not quite certain of his way. It seemed impossible to diverge
4305,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"either to the right or left, and so gain the comparatively easier slope."
4306,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"We were doomed to mount, in the hope of finding successive steps,"
4307,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,inasmuch as a retracing of those taken was not for a moment to be
4308,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,thought of; descent in such cases is always far more dangerous and
4309,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,troublesome. It was fortunate that in crossing twice or thrice the
4310,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"waterfall itself, we were not pumped on to any serious extent. I was"
4311,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"moistened only, being garnished with a Macintosh; and I have only two"
4312,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"scars now left on my shins, the result of scraping too close an"
4313,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,acquaintance with sundry rocks. The whole affair lasted between three
4314,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"and four hours. I cannot recommend it, save to very enthusiastic"
4315,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"mountaineers, or to _ci-devant jeunes hommes_ anxious to test the"
4316,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,effects of Time upon their powers of walking and of endurance.
4317,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,
4318,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,Regaining the hurricane-deck of the Tip-top House--for the roof is the
4319,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"principal promenade, and often times assuredly deserves the name I give"
4320,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"it, how gratefully, as the sun went down, stole the sense of ineffable"
4321,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,grandeur over the somewhat wearied frame! It was a superb evening; and
4322,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"though it would not suit me to cull a leaf from the Guide-book, and tell"
4323,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"all that is therein narrated, I must mention one particular wherein this"
4324,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"locality is notable, if not quite unique. I think I remember something"
4325,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"of the kind, but not so marked, at sunrise as seen from the summit of"
4326,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"Etna; but not thus, on the Righi and Faulhorn in Switzerland, on the Pic"
4327,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"du Midi de Bigorre in the Pyrenees, or on other peaks that I have"
4328,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"climbed in the days of long ago, to salute the coming or speed the"
4329,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"parting day. The nearest approach to it that I have seen, was at the"
4330,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,Great Pyramid of Ghizeh. I allude to the wonderful distinctness and
4331,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"regularity with which the shadow of the great cone itself is traced, at"
4332,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"sunset, striding over heights and lowlands, mound and lake--all the"
4333,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"intervening surface, in fact, between the spectator and the far distant"
4334,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,horizon--until it contracts almost to a point where earth and sky merge
4335,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,into one. The sharpness of these converging parallel lines of shadow in
4336,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"that luminous atmosphere absolutely astounded me. They were as crisp, as"
4337,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"clearly defined, as those that you may see in antique pictures of"
4338,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"Jacob's Dream, leading ladder-wise from Heaven to the head of the"
4339,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"slumbering Patriarch. Sunrise, next morning--for I was again favoured"
4340,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,with clear weather and only sufficient frost to render the roof of the
4341,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"restaurant slightly slippery--sunrise, I say, reserved all this. The"
4342,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"narrow lines, now on the Western horizon, broadened out and came upwards"
4343,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"and forwards, as in the evening they had elongated and gone down. It was"
4344,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"in truth a rare spectacle, not to be forgotten, and individualizes this"
4345,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,natural observatory.
4346,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,
4347,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"As for the view itself, it has been described _ad nauseam_, and I have"
4348,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"only a few words to say about it. It happened, as it often does happen,"
4349,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,that I fell in with an untravelled admirer of the prospect spread out
4350,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"before us, not charmed however with it more than I was myself. But he"
4351,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"would persist in drawing from me an answer to the common question--""how"
4352,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,does this compare with some of the famous points of view in the Swiss
4353,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"Alps?"" Such tests I hold to be absurd, thanking my stars that I can"
4354,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,unreservedly enjoy all fair things that are good of their kind. And so I
4355,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"told the inquirer this simple fact. If, in a mountainous country,"
4356,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"varied, broken, studded with lakes, and rife with all the elements of"
4357,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"the picturesque, you ascend some such superior elevation as this, you"
4358,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"have, _looking down__wards_, a striking panoramic scene, like this in"
4359,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"its general features--more striking perhaps than beautiful, though this"
4360,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"is all matter of taste. The difference lies herein. Here, you plunge"
4361,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"your look downward, or sweep it over surrounding objects--and that's the"
4362,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"end of it. In those other Alps, you add to the four or five or six"
4363,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"thousand feet, below you, as much above--and it is that _upward_ glance"
4364,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,which takes in the marvels of glacier and snow-field and inaccessible
4365,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"peaks. My new acquaintance asked for no more comparisons, but let me"
4366,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,enjoy myself in my own quiet way.
4367,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,
4368,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"The walk down Mount Washington to Crawford's at the Great Notch, as I"
4369,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"believe it is called, is rather a long affair. It must be ten miles, and"
4370,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"parts of it are of the roughest. It took me four hours, in company with"
4371,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"two intelligent and companionable young students of Harvard College,"
4372,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"travelling (in the true way) a-foot, with knapsacks on their backs. But"
4373,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"we hurried it too much, especially as the ridge over and along Mount"
4374,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"Pleasant, and some of its fellows bearing Presidential names, abound in"
4375,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,points of view worth dwelling on. Moreover I was foot-galled; and this
4376,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"reminds me that, inasmuch as I cannot to-day conclude my rambling"
4377,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"reminiscences, I may as well wind up with a touch of information and of"
4378,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,advice. The one is intended for the benefit of pedestrians who make
4379,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"excursions of this sort; the other for stay-at-homes in flat countries,"
4380,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,who have no definite notion whatever of the ups and downs of hilly
4381,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,regions.
4382,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,
4383,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"In the first place, then, you who walk are painfully aware that a sore"
4384,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"foot is almost a calamity, if it befall you whilst _en route_. Remedy"
4385,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"there is none; be thankful that there is an infallible preventive, of"
4386,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,whose unfailing excellence I can speak with unreserved commendation. On
4387,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,its simple merits I once averaged in Switzerland twenty-five miles a
4388,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"day, for thirty successive days; and this without gall or blister. Fool"
4389,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"that I was, to neglect it, two or three weeks ago. Nothing is easier."
4390,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"Ere you start in the morning, soap or grease the naked foot thoroughly,"
4391,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"and then draw the stocking over it. Wash off, with a dash of brandy in"
4392,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"the water, on finishing your day's work. The play of the foot is the"
4393,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"preservative against abrasion--a certain one, I assure you."
4394,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,
4395,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"In the second place, if--passing your life amid prairies or"
4396,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,savannahs--you are sometimes puzzled to comprehend allusions to
4397,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"buttresses, shoulders, ridges, peaks, cones, ravines, and the various"
4398,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"terms in use among enthusiastic mountaineers, I think I can put you on a"
4399,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"very simple explanatory track. Next time you lie in bed, with a few"
4400,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"spare moments for reflection upon this grave topic, just turn on to your"
4401,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,back and elevate one knee or both knees. The coverlid or sheet will
4402,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,immediately assume--I am serious in saying--a curiously correct
4403,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"semblance, I might almost term it a model in relief, of the face of any"
4404,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"mountainous country. Laugh not, but try it. A slight movement on your"
4405,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"part varies the form and outline and relative bearing of hill and vale,"
4406,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"raises a pinnacle here, or there sinks a gorge precipitously steep. If I"
4407,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"had the misfortune to be confined to bed by sickness--excluding gout,"
4408,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"which might render the process impossible--I could thus, with the aid of"
4409,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"a map and some tables of distances, design a passable fac-simile of the"
4410,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,leading White Mountains themselves. Why Yankee ingenuity should not long
4411,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,"ago have manufactured _papier-maché_ plans thereof, in relief,"
4412,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,altogether passes my comprehension. They would sell well as souvenirs of
4413,THE NEW HAMPSHIRE ALPS.,travel.

4652,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"information I only set down, because I think it contains a hint that may"
4653,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,be made practically useful in certain enterprising circles of New York.
4654,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,
4655,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,We were in the Arena at Arles. It was a splendid day--barring the
4656,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"Mistral, that windy nuisance, which, as it eddied through the antique"
4657,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"and ample Roman corridors, brought to my recollection certain"
4658,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"North-Westers experienced on a fine March day in Union Square. In fact,"
4659,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,it was far too cold for sentimentalizing or tracing measurements. But
4660,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"the guardian, it seemed, had not latterly had much chance of exercising"
4661,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"his vocation, and his tongue was too nimble to be frozen. And so at it"
4662,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"he went. Only, being himself more interested in certain proceedings that"
4663,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,had lately taken place within a boarded fence that now encloses the
4664,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"arena, than in historical or legendary lore, his subject was by many"
4665,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"centuries more fresh than the ruins whereon we stood, sunning ourselves"
4666,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"and crouching out of the wind's way. Arles, it appeared, had been"
4667,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"favoured with a bull fight, real Spanish matadors doing the beastly"
4668,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"honours; but to the credit of the city, be it said, the spectacle was"
4669,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"received with intense disapprobation. The gentle Provencals, whose"
4670,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"tastes are more Italian than Spanish, could not brook the sport dear to"
4671,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"their fair Empress who sets fashions in Paris. Indeed, the beauteous"
4672,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"Eugénie, I fear, will hold them to be the merest milk-sops, for when the"
4673,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"grand climax of a disembowelled horse was exhibited before them, the"
4674,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"Arlesians, male and female--in place of shouts of triumphant"
4675,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"approval--gave vent to loud cries of shame and execration, and in short"
4676,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,hissed the Spanish heroes incontinently from the scene of their
4677,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,performance.
4678,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,
4679,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"But what has all this to do with the future of New York, it may be asked"
4680,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"by any reader of these rambling reminiscences. Stay, a moment; I am only"
4681,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"at the commencement. I, too inquired if this were all. ""By no means,"
4682,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"Sir,"" was the reply. ""We had then the real _courses aux taureaux_, and"
4683,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"excellent they were."" Now I must own that my notions of this branch of"
4684,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,the tauromachia were somewhat indistinct. I knew it was not precisely
4685,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"the same thing as buffalo-hunting on the prairies, or as a steeple-chase"
4686,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,in Warwickshire or Yorkshire; but I could not have defined it to save my
4687,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"life. ""Perhaps, Monsieur, has never seen one"" was the next appropriate"
4688,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"suggestion, and it led very naturally to my enlightenment. Briefly,"
4689,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"then, after the torture of the quadrupeds, and the indignant dismissal"
4690,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"of the Spanish matadors, the young gentlemen of the town took the place"
4691,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"of the latter, and began a diversion, which must have been infinitely"
4692,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"amusing, and which, I humbly submit, might be adopted on a different"
4693,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"soil. A lively young bull was turned into the arena, and was followed by"
4694,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"a number of lively youths, armed only with light staves whereon"
4695,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,fluttered blood-red pennons. The fun consists in provoking the excitable
4696,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"animal by the red flags thrust before his face, and eluding the"
4697,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"consequences by a run, a dodge, or a jump. The fence, which was a"
4698,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"barrier for the bull, could easily be vaulted by a nimble-footed"
4699,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,youth--and none but such would venture upon the field. There was just
4700,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,enough danger to make the game piquant; scarcely enough to make it
4701,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,objectionable. One indiscreet young fellow did indeed narrowly escape a
4702,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,catastrophe on the occasion described to me; but the fault was entirely
4703,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"his own. He had been breakfasting at some Arlesian Delmonico's, and had"
4704,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"partially lost his wits before coming to the encounter, while retaining"
4705,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,all his courage. Therefore it happened--and I only tell the story as it
4706,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"was told me--that the youth, when pursued by the bull, tripped and fell,"
4707,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,and the horns of the brute were immediately thrust into the fullest part
4708,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,of his peg-top trousers. A great sensation among the spectators! The
4709,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,bull succeeded in raising and throwing over his head the object of his
4710,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"attack, but by no means in disentangling himself therefrom. His frantic"
4711,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,efforts to bring about a summary toss were for some minutes
4712,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,unsuccessful; and the reader may conceive the mingled sense of the
4713,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"ludicrous and the fearful, that pervaded the assembly. Finally--for even"
4714,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"French cassimere will give way in the end--he, the bull that is,"
4715,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"achieved his aim, and threw his unconscious tormentor a summerset, being"
4716,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,diverted from ulterior measures of vengeance by fresh attacks made upon
4717,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"him, while the crest-fallen hero of the adventure was promptly bundled"
4718,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"over the paling. To sum up this sketch of the sport, in the humane and"
4719,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"pithy words of the guardian of the Amphitheatre--""it does no harm"
4720,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"whatever to the bull, and very little to the young gentleman."""
4721,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,
4722,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"Now then, Mr. Niblo; why should you not establish a Tauro-drome in the"
4723,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,centre of civilization? The leaning of the day is toward athletic
4724,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"exercise. In England, at present, there is a run upon rifle-corps; and"
4725,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,the boldest riders are all bent upon becoming the crackest shots. In New
4726,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"York, I have read since my absence in Europe, that the great English"
4727,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,Eleven have begotten a very rage for cricket. An excellent move this;
4728,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"but then the climate is against it, and the summer is short, and the"
4729,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"game is utterly incomprehensible to the gentler sex, who are always"
4730,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"prompt to encourage the manly prowess of their admirers. Besides, for"
4731,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"lack of a permanent Bude light of adequate strength, we have not yet"
4732,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,achieved the desideratum of playing cricket during those special hours
4733,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,when the youth of a commercial community finds itself prone to
4734,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,relaxation. The _courses aux taureaux_ might just as well take place by
4735,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"gas-light and in a New York circus, as amid Roman ruins and under the"
4736,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,blaze of sunshine. The dandies of Broadway have the two main requisites
4737,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,for brilliant success in this suggested entertainment. Their pluck may
4738,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"not be doubted; and who that has seen them, agile and unwearied in the"
4739,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"German or the _valse à deux temps_, could question their ability to"
4740,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,outfoot the fleetest bull that Andalusia itself could supply? I commend
4741,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,the matter then to the serious consideration of Managers in search of
4742,THE GENTLE ARLESIANS.,"novelties, and to belles who would discover what stuff their beaux are"

4749,AT NUREMBURG.,"For these thirty-eight years past, the _Albion_ hath been protesting"
4750,AT NUREMBURG.,"once a week, in the Latin tongue, that they who skip over the water"
4751,AT NUREMBURG.,"change only their sky, not their mental existence. Nor did I ever"
4752,AT NUREMBURG.,"doubt--indeed I ought to have faith therein--the truth of this motto,"
4753,AT NUREMBURG.,until I found myself yesterday in one of the streets of this old city of
4754,AT NUREMBURG.,"Nuremburg, with no promenaders at the moment save myself. There was not"
4755,AT NUREMBURG.,"a man in sight, tiled with a black beaver chimney-pot; nor a woman"
4756,AT NUREMBURG.,redolent of the Rue de la Paix or Regent Street. Then it was that I
4757,AT NUREMBURG.,incontinently asked myself if I were truly a Briton by birth and an
4758,AT NUREMBURG.,Anglo-American by local ties; or whether I were not in fact a German
4759,AT NUREMBURG.,burgher of the middle ages. I should scarcely have been surprised at
4760,AT NUREMBURG.,"sight of grave Albert Durer himself coming round the corner, or at"
4761,AT NUREMBURG.,"hearing Hans Sachs, the cobbler poet, trolling one of his six thousand"
4762,AT NUREMBURG.,ditties.
4763,AT NUREMBURG.,
4764,AT NUREMBURG.,"To say this, is simply to add the testimony of another witness to that"
4765,AT NUREMBURG.,which has set down Nuremburg as the city of all Europe least changed
4766,AT NUREMBURG.,with changing times. The very little that has been done of late years in
4767,AT NUREMBURG.,"the way of repairing and rebuilding, within the walls, has been done in"
4768,AT NUREMBURG.,strict accordance with the prevalent mediæval style. The result is
4769,AT NUREMBURG.,"that--whereas elsewhere, when you stumble upon a private dwelling of"
4770,AT NUREMBURG.,moderate proportions showing plainly that it was built some two or three
4771,AT NUREMBURG.,"or four or five centuries ago, you congratulate yourself upon having"
4772,AT NUREMBURG.,"discovered a curiosity (as such a one really would be in Paris, for"
4773,AT NUREMBURG.,"instance)--here the difficult search would be for a house, modern and"
4774,AT NUREMBURG.,spruce. Not that a rectangularly-ornamented gable-end is the
4775,AT NUREMBURG.,"quintessence of architectural beauty, or that a basement front of low"
4776,AT NUREMBURG.,iron-barred windows suggests an agreeable or hospitable interior. By no
4777,AT NUREMBURG.,"means. If this were all, there would be considerable quaintness, and"
4778,AT NUREMBURG.,nought beyond. But it is otherwise. Some of the decorative bits that
4779,AT NUREMBURG.,"catch the eye right and left, are absolute gems in their way--whether"
4780,AT NUREMBURG.,"oriel windows, or fantastic turrets, or figures and devices embossed and"
4781,AT NUREMBURG.,"sculptured. Taste, generally for the Gothic, but diverging at a later"
4782,AT NUREMBURG.,"date into the Renaissance style, seems to have run riot here in wilful"
4783,AT NUREMBURG.,playfulness.
4784,AT NUREMBURG.,
4785,AT NUREMBURG.,"Of the regular sights set down in the hand-books, and explored by"
4786,AT NUREMBURG.,"conscientious Englishmen with their Murrays under their arms, it would"
4787,AT NUREMBURG.,not be appropriate to speak at length. I may however indulge in an
4788,AT NUREMBURG.,"allusion to the different material, whereof are constructed two of the"
4789,AT NUREMBURG.,"most highly-laboured marvels, here exhibited. Now the city itself is"
4790,AT NUREMBURG.,"divided into two nearly equal parts by the small river Pegnitz, these"
4791,AT NUREMBURG.,parts bearing the names respectively of the principal church that stands
4792,AT NUREMBURG.,"in either. The one is dedicated to St. Sebald, the other to St."
4793,AT NUREMBURG.,"Lawrence. The former, as its chief curiosity, contains the shrine of its"
4794,AT NUREMBURG.,"patron Saint, an elaborate and most exquisitely wrought fretwork canopy,"
4795,AT NUREMBURG.,"about fifteen feet in height, beneath which repose his remains. The"
4796,AT NUREMBURG.,"design is in a measure architectural, and Gothic of course; but the"
4797,AT NUREMBURG.,"ornamentation is its great glory, though one is staggered somewhat at"
4798,AT NUREMBURG.,the irreverent juxtaposition of the twelve Apostles with Cupids and
4799,AT NUREMBURG.,"Mermaids, and at sundry Fathers of the Church disporting themselves amid"
4800,AT NUREMBURG.,clusters of fruit and bouquets of flowers. This monument of artistic
4801,AT NUREMBURG.,"skill was the work of Peter Vischer, one of the worthies of Nuremburg,"
4802,AT NUREMBURG.,"and has been completed three hundred and forty years. The able worker,"
4803,AT NUREMBURG.,having dispensed with consistency in the admixture of Christian and
4804,AT NUREMBURG.,"Pagan accessories, as I have mentioned, was at least justified in"
4805,AT NUREMBURG.,introducing a figure of himself as one of the human animals; and a very
4806,AT NUREMBURG.,"fine statuette he makes, with chisel in hand and his working apron about"
4807,AT NUREMBURG.,"him. Now mark, if you please, O attentive reader, this shrine of St."
4808,AT NUREMBURG.,"Sebald is entirely cast in bronze. To say that the effect is beautiful,"
4809,AT NUREMBURG.,is too limited praise. It is harmonious; thoroughly satisfying to the
4810,AT NUREMBURG.,eye; perfect.
4811,AT NUREMBURG.,
4812,AT NUREMBURG.,"Cross with me now, if you be not weary, one of the dozen picturesque"
4813,AT NUREMBURG.,"bridges over the Pegnitz, and let us see what Adam Krafft, another great"
4814,AT NUREMBURG.,"Nuremburger of that same age, has done in the same line of Gothic"
4815,AT NUREMBURG.,"decoration for the Church of St. Lawrence. His work is a shrine, or I"
4816,AT NUREMBURG.,should rather say a repository for the sacramental wafer of the Roman
4817,AT NUREMBURG.,"Catholic rite. It is an open-work spire, tapering to the height of sixty"
4818,AT NUREMBURG.,"feet, with an infinity of graceful detail, and rare sculptures in high"
4819,AT NUREMBURG.,"and low relief. One fantasy is, I think, unique of its kind. The roof is"
4820,AT NUREMBURG.,"a little too low to admit the crowning summit fairly; and the top,"
4821,AT NUREMBURG.,"therefore, has been made to bend over. The effect--purposely designed, I"
4822,AT NUREMBURG.,cannot doubt--is odd; nor can I agree with the fantastic remark of
4823,AT NUREMBURG.,"Murray's Handbook, that it ""has the air of a plant which is chocked in"
4824,AT NUREMBURG.,"its further growth."" Spires and plants are not endowed with equal"
4825,AT NUREMBURG.,"pliability, and the idea of one of the former waving about, or nodding"
4826,AT NUREMBURG.,"gracefully, suggests an immediate ""stand from under."" And this all the"
4827,AT NUREMBURG.,"more in this instance, because--which brings me thus round-aboutedly to"
4828,AT NUREMBURG.,"my main point--the material hereon employed is stone, a clean and"
4829,AT NUREMBURG.,"white-toned stone, that looks as though its excellent carvings and"
4830,AT NUREMBURG.,mouldings had been completed only for the last Crystal Palace
4831,AT NUREMBURG.,Exhibition. The apparent newness is downright provoking; and if Adam
4832,AT NUREMBURG.,"Krafft could peep at it from his honoured grave, he would never dream"
4833,AT NUREMBURG.,that he has lain therein three centuries and a half. Let me say
4834,AT NUREMBURG.,further--having thus stumbled upon personalities--that he too made
4835,AT NUREMBURG.,himself as durable as his work. And with more modesty than Master Peter
4836,AT NUREMBURG.,"Vischer above named, who moulded for himself a niche in his monument"
4837,AT NUREMBURG.,"corresponding, in size and position, to the one assigned to the patron"
4838,AT NUREMBURG.,"Saint, though being at the opposite end of the shrine, the glorifier and"
4839,AT NUREMBURG.,the glorified could not be taken into one glance and a comparison
4840,AT NUREMBURG.,"forced. There was more modesty, I say, in Adam Krafft's mode of"
4841,AT NUREMBURG.,"travelling down the stream of Time as showman of his show, though he was"
4842,AT NUREMBURG.,"not methinks without a dash of _craft_, as befits the bearer of his"
4843,AT NUREMBURG.,name. Down upon their marrow-bones (as the school boys have it) with
4844,AT NUREMBURG.,"rounded backs grope Adam and his two apprentices, the three backs"
4845,AT NUREMBURG.,"forming a base of operations, or in plainer words upholding the"
4846,AT NUREMBURG.,"sixty-feet structure, and doing for it that which is done beneath his"
4847,AT NUREMBURG.,"rival's shrine by a snail at each of the four corners. Perhaps, after"
4848,AT NUREMBURG.,"all, the sculptor-architect was wiser than the bronze-caster, in his"
4849,AT NUREMBURG.,mode of identifying himself with his work. Amid a multitude of figures
4850,AT NUREMBURG.,"and emblems, Peter Vischer, as well as St. Sebald, may be overlooked,"
4851,AT NUREMBURG.,"for they are small in size; but you can scarcely avoid asking ""who are"
4852,AT NUREMBURG.,"these three?"" when you note how lofty is the edifice that the large"
4853,AT NUREMBURG.,quasi-Atlases bear.
4854,AT NUREMBURG.,
4855,AT NUREMBURG.,"Enough, touching these minor differences. The essential one, whereof I"
4856,AT NUREMBURG.,"intended to speak, is the material in which the pair wrought"
4857,AT NUREMBURG.,respectively. I have said that the bronze entirely satisfied my
4858,AT NUREMBURG.,"critical eye, which is tantamount to saying that it charmed me. Not so"

4864,AT NUREMBURG.,"that the famous Eleanor's Crosses in England never quite pleased me,"
4865,AT NUREMBURG.,because therein the tracery and dainty delicacies of the design are not
4866,AT NUREMBURG.,backed by anything massive. The greater part of my readers will not
4867,AT NUREMBURG.,"agree with me. I am sorry, but can't help it. Only, I don't want to see"
4868,AT NUREMBURG.,any more open-work baskets in stone. Give me the most fantastical of
4869,AT NUREMBURG.,"Gothic devices, as many as you please, so long as they have something to"
4870,AT NUREMBURG.,cling to.
4871,AT NUREMBURG.,
4872,AT NUREMBURG.,"Finally, I have fallen quite in love with this quaint, irregular old"
4873,AT NUREMBURG.,"place. Nor do I know how long I might have loitered, had not the"
4874,AT NUREMBURG.,"inevitable disillusion come, as come it will over so many promising"

4876,AT NUREMBURG.,"those honest old times of Durer, Vischer, Krafft, and Company, and"
4877,AT NUREMBURG.,imagined myself a free burgher of a free city. But the spell was doubly
4878,AT NUREMBURG.,broken. At the old castle--whereof some small apartments are
4879,AT NUREMBURG.,unpretendingly fitted up for the King and Queen of Bavaria--there comes
4880,AT NUREMBURG.,"upon one, in another part thereof, a vision of certain instruments of"
4881,AT NUREMBURG.,"torture, used undoubtedly in those good old times to keep the burghers"
4882,AT NUREMBURG.,submissive to their oligarchy of merchant princes. And again at the
4883,AT NUREMBURG.,"Rath-haus, or Hotel de Ville; the maidenly show-woman lighted us by"
4884,AT NUREMBURG.,"lanthorn-light through a set of subterranean dungeons, too numerous to"
4885,AT NUREMBURG.,"have been destined for offenders only against the criminal laws, too"
4886,AT NUREMBURG.,horrible to be sanctioned under our creed of comparative gentleness. And
4887,AT NUREMBURG.,"so, on the whole, I returned back to actual existence, and to all the"
4888,AT NUREMBURG.,"boredom of Parliamentary conflicts and Presidential elections, with a"
4889,AT NUREMBURG.,certain sense of relief.

4899,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"suggested; all come before you in confused array; not unfrequently,"

4902,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"between walls that were put up long before the Christian era, and under"
4903,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,a roof supported by pillars whereon the sun of Phrygia has shone. Pagan
4904,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"and Christian--all is jumbled; until finally, unless you have the"
4905,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"patience of Job and the zeal of an antiquarian, you begin to doubt all"
4906,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"legendary and historic lore, and to measure what you see by its"
4907,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"external attractiveness alone. One thing, however, is clearly marked."
4908,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"You are groping about, in a state of vexed uncertainty; suddenly you"
4909,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"come upon an inscription, conspicuous, in large legible letters, often"
4910,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"gilded. Now you are grateful. You stride up; and lo, there stands,"
4911,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,emblazoned before you the interesting fact that such or such a Pontifex
4912,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"Maximus, some Benedict, or Clemens, or Pius, or Leo, or Gregory,"
4913,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"restored, excavated, ornamented, or built, as the case may have been,"

4916,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,up chronological knowledge in regard to the Papacy. These fulsome
4917,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"records omit, not only all description that might be useful; they fail"
4918,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"to mention the year of the World, or the year of Grace, altogether. In"
4919,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"place thereof, you learn that the digging or decoration in question took"
4920,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,place in a certain year of the reign of a certain Pope; but as the chair
4921,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"of St. Peter has had one hundred and sixteen occupants, between A.D."
4922,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"1000 and A.D. 1860, ""Anno VI. of Innocent VI."" or ""Anno II. of Julius"

4924,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,after chiselled or painted immortality is nowhere more contemptibly
4925,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"exhibited than in Raphael's famous Loggie at the Vatican, where, over"
4926,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"each separate window, one reads in staring type, ""Leo X., Pontifex"
4927,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"Maximus."" Surely there is something strangely inconsistent, in a power"
4928,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"that boasts its remote origin and its endowment in perpetuity, thus"
4929,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,taking infinite pains to isolate its historical fragments.

4931,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,A smile only--not a grunt of indignation--is elicited by another
4932,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"peculiarity of Rome, which comes under the lounger's notice. Something"
4933,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,of the same sort is perhaps also observable in all large cities; but it
4934,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,never struck me so strongly. I allude to the names of the streets and
4935,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"squares and public places, which names by the way are carefully and"
4936,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"prominently labelled. The jumble is curious, though one starts a little"
4937,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"at times from what to Protestant eyes seems irreverent. Take a sample,"
4938,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,dispensing with the titles in Italian. You may stroll through the street
4939,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"of the Three Virgins, of the Three Robbers, of Jesus, of the Tarpeian"
4940,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"Rock, of the Two Butchers' Shops, of the Baboon, of Divine Love, of the"

4944,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"Lion's Mouth, of the Five Moons, of Minerva, of the Incurables, of the"
4945,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"Wind, of the Wolf, of St. John Beheaded. You may halt in the square of"
4946,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"the Mouth of Truth, in that of the Field of Flowers, in that of the"
4947,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"Satyrs, in that of Consolation, in that of the Goose. It is evident that"
4948,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,no ruling mind or principle has regulated this public nomenclature. _Tot

4952,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"Here is a specimen. Two young men of my acquaintance, who have been"

4955,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,who was bringing a protracted sojourn to a close; and to him the cavalry
4956,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"officers were in a measure consigned. ""Can you tell me what's to be seen"
4957,ROMAN NOMENCLATURE.,"at Ostia and Veii?"" said one of them to me, forty-eight hours after"

5114,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"The first tickled me exceedingly, as a genuine specimen of the so-called"
5115,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"Irish Bull. Mr. Somebody had entered his name, and added thereto this"
5116,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"valuable bit of information: ""Walked up from Chamouni in four hours and"
5117,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"a-half, _having lost the greater part of his way_?"" The italics are"
5118,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"mine, of course; but is not the _mot_ worth its space in print?"
5119,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,
5120,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"My other extract concerns some of my young countrywomen, and I trust"
5121,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,that their countrywomen who may read it will forgive me for putting it
5122,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"into circulation. They are very poor laughers, who never laugh when the"
5123,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,joke tells against themselves; in this instance it is we who pay the
5124,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,piper. A party of English school girls had been lately at Montanvert
5125,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"with their governess, and had set down their names one after another in"
5126,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"the big book, as is the custom there. A waggish Frenchman, waiting of"
5127,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"course until their backs were turned, had bracketted the list, and"
5128,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"written against the conclave this pithy and caustic criticism: ""_Teint"
5129,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"rouge; appétit géant; langage embarrassé._"" What an ungallant scamp! Yet"
5130,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,it must be owned that the same absurd album is rich in provocatives. A
5131,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,"running fire of sarcasm, exchanged between English and French tourists,"
5132,LIVRES DES VOYAGEURS.,marks almost every page.

5225,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Wholesome, and needful for the public good."
5226,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",He has denied his Governors the power
5227,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","To sanction laws of pressing urgency,"

5229,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Till his assent should be obtained; and when
5230,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Suspended thus, he has failed wilfully"
5231,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",To give them further thought. He has refused

5233,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","To districts thickly peopled, unless they,"
5234,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Who dwelt therein, would basely throw away"
5235,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Their right to representatives--a right

5240,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",The Legislative Bodies to assemble
5241,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","At places inconvenient, and unusual,"
5242,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",And whence their public records were remote.
5243,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",He has repeatedly dissolved the Houses
5244,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Of Representatives for interfering
5245,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","With manly firmness, when he has invaded"
5246,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","The People's rights. Long time he has refused,"

5256,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","To check the population of these States,"
5257,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Thwarting the laws for naturalization
5258,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Of foreigners, withholding his assent"

5269,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","New offices in multitudes, and sent"
5270,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Swarms of his officers to harass us,"
5271,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","And to eat out our substance. He has kept,"
5272,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","In times of peace, among us, standing armies,"
5273,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Without the sanction of our Legislatures.
5274,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",His aim has been to place the military
5275,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Above the civil power, and beyond"

5277,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","To make us subject to a jurisdiction,"
5278,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","In spirit foreign to our Constitution,"
5279,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",And unacknowledged by our laws; assenting

5295,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Of English laws; establishing therein
5296,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",An arbitrary power; and enlarging
5297,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Its boundaries, to render it at once"
5298,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","The fit example, and the instrument"
5299,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",For bringing into these our Colonies
5300,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",The same despotic rule: For taking from us
5301,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Our Charters; and abolishing our laws
5302,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Most valued; changing thus, in principle,"
5303,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Our forms of Government: And for suspending
5304,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Our Legislatures, with the declaration"
5305,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","That they, themselves, in each and every case,"
5306,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Were vested with supreme authority
5307,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",To legislate for us.
5308,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",He has laid down
5309,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","His sway, by holding us without the pale"
5310,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Of his protection, and by waging war"
5311,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Against us. He has plundered on our seas;
5312,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Ravaged our coasts; our cities burnt; and taken
5313,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Our people's lives. He is transporting hither
5314,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Armies composed of foreign mercenaries,"
5315,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","To end the works of death, and desolation,"
5316,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","And tyranny, begun with circumstances"

5319,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",The Ruler of a nation civilized.
5320,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","He has constrained our fellow-citizens,"
5321,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","On the high seas made captive, to bear arms"
5322,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Against their country, and of friends and brothers"
5323,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",
5324,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","To be the executioners, or fall"
5325,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Beneath his creatures' hands. He has excited
5326,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Amongst ourselves domestic insurrection;
5327,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",And sought to bring on the inhabitants
5328,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Of our frontier the savage Indian,"
5329,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Whose code of warfare, merciless and sure,"
5330,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Spares not, in undistinguished massacre,"
5331,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Age, sex, condition."
5332,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","We, in every stage"
5333,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Of these oppressions, have in humblest terms"
5334,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Petitioned for redress. To our petitions,"
5335,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Though oft repeated, there has been _one_ answer--"
5336,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Repeated injury.
5337,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","A prince, whose life"
5338,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",And conduct thus are marked by every act
5339,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","That may define a Tyrant, is unfit"
5340,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",To rule o'er Freemen.
5341,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Neither have we failed
5342,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",In due attention to our British brethren.
5343,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","From time to time, we have admonished them"
5344,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Of efforts, by their Legislature made,"
5345,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Unwarrantably to extend to us
5346,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,","Their jurisdiction. How we emigrated,"

5348,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",We to their native justice have appealed

5352,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Would mar our intercourse and friendship. They
5353,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Have also turned a deaf ear to the voice
5354,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",Of Justice and of Consanguinity.
5355,"A WELL KNOWN DOCUMENT,",So must we yield to the necessity

6176,I.,To guide thy bark o'er the trackless waste
6177,I.,
6178,I.,"Earth knows me, too; and will heave and quake"
6179,I.,Where my subterranean course I take:
6180,I.,"And none so aghast at my ravages then,"
6181,I.,As they whose type was the Sire of men.
6182,I.,
6183,I.,But not ever thus; at times I'm seen
6184,I.,On the cheek or the neck of Beauty's queen;
6185,I.,Or (to favoured mortal alone confest)
6186,I.,Tinging the snow upon Beauty's breast.
6187,I.,
6188,I.,"So, whether above the waves, or below,"
6189,I.,"Or beneath the Earth, or on breast of snow,"
6190,I.,"Linked with the past, or alive to-day,"
6191,I.,Tell who I am--if tell ye may.
6192,I.,
6193,I.,
6194,II.,II.
6195,II.,
6196,II.,
6197,II.,My lady calls; my First obeys--
6198,II.,Nor less his lord's behest:
6199,II.,"In bower and hall, in olden days,"
6200,II.,My First was in request.
6201,II.,
6202,II.,Yet 'tis my First that tells us now
6203,II.,What then my First was doing;
6204,II.,"How he went forth to war, and how"
6205,II.,He prospered in his wooing.
6206,II.,
6207,II.,A wise King bade the lazy fool
6208,II.,"Observe my Second's ways,"
6209,II.,And notice--as it were in school--
6210,II.,The wisdom she displays.
6211,II.,
6212,II.,"Yet hers is a devouring race,"
6213,II.,And might--though strange it be--
6214,II.,"Eat up, in given time and place,"
6215,II.,"My First, or you, or me."
6216,II.,
6217,II.,As for my whole--in every age
6218,II.,Mankind must have its show;
6219,II.,"In actual life, on mimic stage,"
6220,II.,"In peace, war, joy, or woe."
6221,II.,
6222,II.,"Now 'tis a wedding, now a death,"
6223,II.,"A gathering, or a play;"
6224,II.,"It comes, but, like a passing breath,"
6225,II.,Full soon 'tis swept away.
6226,II.,
6227,II.,
6228,III.,III.
6229,III.,
6230,III.,
6231,III.,When Richard of the Lion Heart
6232,III.,"In arms the Paynim sought,"
6233,III.,"I of his panoply was part,"
6234,III.,"And, wielding me, he fought."
6235,III.,
6236,III.,When ladies on a different field
6237,III.,"With men their skill essay,"
6238,III.,I am the weapon that they wield
6239,III.,If they would gain the day.
6240,III.,
6241,III.,When cooks in certain dishes show
6242,III.,"Their culinary art,"
6243,III.,I am on hand--the masters know
6244,III.,What flavour I impart.
6245,III.,
6246,III.,
6247,IV.,IV.
6248,IV.,
6249,IV.,
6250,IV.,I'm a word of one syllable. Look you for me
6251,IV.,Mid Niagara's roar; in the turbulent sea;
6252,IV.,"Where the winds and the waters are wildest at play,"
6253,IV.,And fling off their laughter in volumes of spray.
6254,IV.,
6255,IV.,I'm a noun of five letters; but throw one aside--
6256,IV.,I'm a verb; with the noun I'm no longer allied.
6257,IV.,"I'm a grave, solemn verb; nay, I truly might say,"
6258,IV.,Those who follow my precept do nothing but pray.
6259,IV.,
6260,IV.,But again; let two letters be dropped--there's a change;
6261,IV.,As a noun--and by no means a grave one--I range.
6262,IV.,"Now I'm here; now I'm there; seen by night and by day,"
6263,IV.,"For in short, I'm a beam, or a flash, or a ray."
6264,IV.,
6265,IV.,"Thus a verb and two nouns packed together you see,"
6266,IV.,In a word of one syllable.--What can it be?
6267,IV.,
6268,IV.,
6269,V.,V.
6270,V.,
6271,V.,
6272,V.,"There are some words, that in a double sense"
6273,V.,Must be interpreted; of these am I.
6274,V.,"Your housemaid, thus, wilt know me literally"
6275,V.,"Better than you do; but, with all respect"
6276,V.,"For Betty's carefulness, she scarce can catch"
6277,V.,"My finer meaning. I'm, with her, a thing"
6278,V.,"For brush and duster; in me, you behold"
6279,V.,A symbol. So much for me as I stand.
6280,V.,Now cut my head off--I'm another word
6281,V.,"Of narrow and of wide significance,"
6282,V.,"Handful of dust, the very world itself."
6283,V.,Cut off my tail--the effect is still the same;
6284,V.,I'm yet another of those duplex words:
6285,V.,"Mental and bodily, an essential part"
6286,V.,"Of all mankind, without which no one lives,"
6287,V.,"Nay, not an animal, though you may swear,"
6288,V.,"And truly too, that I have no existence,"
6289,V.,"And never had, in certain men and women."
6290,V.,Enough: it is not difficult to find
6291,V.,"Three words, six meanings, in one syllable."
6292,V.,
6293,V.,
6294,VI.,VI.
6295,VI.,
6296,VI.,
6297,VI.,"Well may I call myself cosmopolite,"
6298,VI.,Being of all lands and times. Barbaric tribes
6299,VI.,"Know me, and honour. In the gentler world,"
6300,VI.,"Scholars have studied me, and poets sung,"
6301,VI.,"And painters painted, and musicians hymned."
6302,VI.,Nor from Religion have I held myself
6303,VI.,Apart. In Pagan and in savage rites
6304,VI.,"Largely I mingle; and some Saints at least,"
6305,VI.,"Worshipped among us, owe me much. In short,"
6306,VI.,"Theme, inspiration, puzzle--I am all."
6307,VI.,"As to my form, it may not be defined;"
6308,VI.,Yet this is certain: were I rent in twain
6309,VI.,"And of one half bereft, I should not have"
6310,VI.,A leg to stand on--of the other half
6311,VI.,"Equally mulcted, I should endless be."
6312,VI.,
6313,VI.,
6314,VII.,VII.
6315,VII.,
6316,VII.,
6317,VII.,"In me, as the scholar saith,"
6318,VII.,"Is exhaustion, wasting, death."
6319,VII.,But--so close do grave and gay
6320,VII.,"Touch, in this our world--you may,"
6321,VII.,"By a change of accent made,"
6322,VII.,Change the meaning I conveyed;
6323,VII.,Change me so that I proclaim
6324,VII.,"Victory won, and spoils, and fame!"
6325,VII.,
6326,VII.,
6327,VIII.,VIII.
6328,VIII.,
6329,VIII.,
6330,VIII.,"My first's a French noun; and, without it, stands not"
6331,VIII.,"Church, palace, or hospital, villa, or cot."
6332,VIII.,My Second no feature distinctive can claim;
6333,VIII.,It but echoes my First--'t is precisely the same.
6334,VIII.,Yet my Whole to French parentage makes no pretence;
6335,VIII.,"It is plain Anglo-Saxon, in sound as in sense;"
6336,VIII.,"Nor more widely asunder does pole lie from pole,"
6337,VIII.,Than my Gallican parts and my Anglican whole.
6338,VIII.,"Impalpable, it--solid, tangible, they;"
6339,VIII.,"They may last, for long ages--it passes away!"
6340,VIII.,"Now a sign of approval, a token of scorn;"
6341,VIII.,Sometimes of the wind or the waves it is born;
6342,VIII.,Though its presence at intervals surely you'll trace
6343,VIII.,Where my First and my Second have stablished their place;
6344,VIII.,Where King hath his dwelling or Trade hath her marts--
6345,VIII.,"A whole evanescent, material parts!"
