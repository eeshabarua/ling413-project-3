29,ADVERTISEMENT.,
30,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Some of the Pieces in this volume have been separately published,"
31,ADVERTISEMENT.,"at different times; the indulgence, I may say favour,"
32,ADVERTISEMENT.,"with which they were individually received, has encouraged me"
33,ADVERTISEMENT.,"to collect and re-publish them. I have added many others,"
34,ADVERTISEMENT.,"which are now first printed. I shall be well satisfied, if they"
35,ADVERTISEMENT.,find as favourable a reception as their precursors; and are
36,ADVERTISEMENT.,"thought not to have increased the size, without at all increasing"
37,ADVERTISEMENT.,"the merit, of the book."
38,ADVERTISEMENT.,
39,ADVERTISEMENT.,"I cannot omit this opportunity of thanking those Critics,"
40,ADVERTISEMENT.,who have honoured me by reviewing my verses. I owe them
41,ADVERTISEMENT.,my warm acknowledgments for candidly measuring my Poems
42,ADVERTISEMENT.,by their pretensions. They have looked at them as they really
43,ADVERTISEMENT.,were;--as the amusements of the leisure hours of a man
44,ADVERTISEMENT.,whose fortune will not favour his inclination to devote himself
45,ADVERTISEMENT.,to poetry; and conceiving a favourable opinion of them in
46,ADVERTISEMENT.,"that character, have kindly expressed it."
47,ADVERTISEMENT.,
48,ADVERTISEMENT.,"_London, December, 1827._"
49,ADVERTISEMENT.,
50,ADVERTISEMENT.,"During the progress of these pages through the press, it has"
51,ADVERTISEMENT.,pleased Providence to inflict upon me the severest calamity that
52,ADVERTISEMENT.,domestic life can sustain. In the private sorrows of the humble
53,ADVERTISEMENT.,"candidate for literary fame, I am aware that the world will feel"
54,ADVERTISEMENT.,"no interest, yet humanity will forgive the weakness that struggles"
55,ADVERTISEMENT.,"under such a bereavement, and will pardon the tear that falls"
56,ADVERTISEMENT.,"upon such a tomb. If, indeed, the Being who is lost to her family"
57,ADVERTISEMENT.,"and society were endowed only with those gifts and graces,"
58,ADVERTISEMENT.,"which are shared by thousands of her sex, I should have been"
59,ADVERTISEMENT.,"silent at this moment. To those who knew her,[1] and to know"
60,ADVERTISEMENT.,"her was to esteem and love, this tribute will be superfluous; but"
61,ADVERTISEMENT.,"to those who knew her not, I would say, that, superadded to"
62,ADVERTISEMENT.,"every natural advantage, to the charms of every polite accomplishment,"
63,ADVERTISEMENT.,"and to a cheerful and sincere piety, she was deeply"
64,ADVERTISEMENT.,"imbued with the love of literature and of science. In these, her"
65,ADVERTISEMENT.,Lectures on the Physiology of the External Senses exhibit a
66,ADVERTISEMENT.,"splendid proof of her acquirements in their highest walks, and"
67,ADVERTISEMENT.,are an imperishable memorial of her patient and laborious research.
68,ADVERTISEMENT.,They who were present at the delivery of these Lectures
69,ADVERTISEMENT.,"will not soon forget the effect of her impressive elocution,"
70,ADVERTISEMENT.,chastened as it was by as unaffected modesty as ever adorned
71,ADVERTISEMENT.,and dignified a woman. I speak of that which she performed--that
72,ADVERTISEMENT.,which her capacious mind had meditated I forbear to mention.
73,ADVERTISEMENT.,For the advancement of her sex in pursuits that are intellectual
74,ADVERTISEMENT.,"she made many sacrifices, both of her feelings and her"
75,ADVERTISEMENT.,"time; yet, in all she did, and in all she contemplated, usefulness"
76,ADVERTISEMENT.,was her end and aim--but I must not proceed; less than this I
77,ADVERTISEMENT.,could not say--more than this might be deemed ostentatious.
78,ADVERTISEMENT.,
79,ADVERTISEMENT.,
80,ADVERTISEMENT.,"What earthly tongue, and, oh! what human pen"
81,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Can tell that scene of suffering, too severe."
82,ADVERTISEMENT.,"'Tis ever present to my sight, oh! when"
83,ADVERTISEMENT.,Will the sound cease its torture on mine ear?
84,ADVERTISEMENT.,
85,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Oh! my lost love, thou patient Being, never!"
86,ADVERTISEMENT.,Thy dying look of love can I forget;
87,ADVERTISEMENT.,"The last fond pressure of thy hand, _for ever!_"
88,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Thrills in my veins, I see thy struggles yet."
89,ADVERTISEMENT.,
90,ADVERTISEMENT.,Thy sculptured beauty is before me now:
91,ADVERTISEMENT.,"In thy calm dignity, and sweet repose,"
92,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Alas! sad memory re-invests thy brow,"
93,ADVERTISEMENT.,"With death's stern agony, and pain's last throes."
94,ADVERTISEMENT.,
95,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Desolate heart be still--forgive, oh God!"
96,ADVERTISEMENT.,The cries of feeble nature stricken sore.
97,ADVERTISEMENT.,Father! assuage the terrors of thy rod.
98,ADVERTISEMENT.,Teach me to see thy wisdom--and adore!
99,ADVERTISEMENT.,
100,ADVERTISEMENT.,
101,ADVERTISEMENT.,[Footnote 1: I cannot resist the melancholy gratification of quoting
102,ADVERTISEMENT.,"from the Literary Gazette, of August 18, in which the death of Mrs. Gent"
103,ADVERTISEMENT.,"was announced to the public.--""Science has, since our last, suffered a"
104,ADVERTISEMENT.,severe lost by the death of this accomplished lady; she was well known
105,ADVERTISEMENT.,"for her high attainments as a Lecturer, and her Course on the Physiology"
106,ADVERTISEMENT.,of the External Senses was a perfect model of elegant composition and
107,ADVERTISEMENT.,"refined oratory. Mrs. Gent died at the residence of her husband, Thomas"
108,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Gent, Esq. Doctor's Commons, after a month of severe suffering, which"
109,ADVERTISEMENT.,"she bore with singular fortitude, and the most pious resignation. There"
110,ADVERTISEMENT.,"is a fine bust of her, by Behnes; it was in the Exhibition two years"
111,ADVERTISEMENT.,"since, and, from its intrinsic simplicity and beauty alone, has had many"
112,ADVERTISEMENT.,"casts made from it."""
113,ADVERTISEMENT.,
114,ADVERTISEMENT.,"And one of the most distinguished Poets of the present day, will, I am"
115,ADVERTISEMENT.,"sure, forgive me if I quote his beautiful words in writing to me on"
116,ADVERTISEMENT.,"this subject--for his talents she had the highest admiration, and no"
117,ADVERTISEMENT.,one was better able than himself to appreciate the excellence of her
118,ADVERTISEMENT.,"character.--""As to condolence, I never condole--what condolence could"
119,ADVERTISEMENT.,any one offer for the loss of so estimable a being as has been lost to
120,ADVERTISEMENT.,society in your accomplished wife? I had a very great respect and esteem
121,ADVERTISEMENT.,"for her, and it would have highly gratified me to have been able to"
122,ADVERTISEMENT.,lighten the least of her trials; but what avails writing or visiting on
123,ADVERTISEMENT.,occasions of such real pain. She lived a most amiable being--and for
124,ADVERTISEMENT.,such there is the highest hope in the Highest World. If I had conceived
125,ADVERTISEMENT.,"that her illness was at all serious, I should have gone to gather wisdom"
126,ADVERTISEMENT.,"from her for my own hour--but now, that all her anxieties are past, I"
127,ADVERTISEMENT.,"can invent no condolence.""]"

221,POEMS.,
222,POEMS.,"Tis sweet in boyhood's visionary mood,"
223,POEMS.,"When glowing Fancy, innocently gay,"
224,POEMS.,"Flings forth, like motes, her bright aërial brood,"
225,POEMS.,To dance and shine in Hope's prolific ray;
226,POEMS.,"'Tis sweet, unweeting how the flight of years"
227,POEMS.,"May darkling roll in trials and in tears,"
228,POEMS.,"To dress the future in what garb we list,"
229,POEMS.,And shape the thousand joys that never may exist.
230,POEMS.,"But he, sad wight! of all that feverish train,"
231,POEMS.,"Fool'd by those phantoms of the wizard brain,"
232,POEMS.,"Most wildly dotes, whom young ambition stings"
233,POEMS.,To trust his weight upon poetic wings;
234,POEMS.,"He, downward looking in his airy ride,"
235,POEMS.,Beholds Elysium bloom on every side;
236,POEMS.,"Unearthly bliss each thrilling nerve attunes,"
237,POEMS.,And thus the dreamer with himself communes.
238,POEMS.,"Yes! Earth shall witness, 'ere my star be set,"
239,POEMS.,That partial nature mark'd me for her pet;
240,POEMS.,"That Phoebus doom'd me, kind indulgent sire!"
241,POEMS.,"To mount his car, and set the world on fire."
242,POEMS.,"Fame's steep ascent by easy flights to win,"
243,POEMS.,With a neat pocket volume I'll begin;
244,POEMS.,"And dirge, and sonnet, ode, and epigram,"
245,POEMS.,Shall show mankind how versatile I am.
246,POEMS.,The buskin'd Muse shall next my pen descry:
247,POEMS.,The boxes from their inmost rows shall sigh;
248,POEMS.,"The pit shall weep, the galleries deplore"
249,POEMS.,Such moving woes as ne'er were heard before:
250,POEMS.,"Enough--I'll leave them in their soft hysterics,"
251,POEMS.,"Mount, in a brighter blaze, and dazzle with Homerics."
252,POEMS.,
253,POEMS.,"Then, while my name runs ringing through Reviews,"
254,POEMS.,"And maids, wives, widows, smitten with my Muse,"
255,POEMS.,Assail me with Platonic _billet-doux_.
256,POEMS.,"From this suburban attic I'll dismount,"
257,POEMS.,With Coutts or Barclays open an account;
258,POEMS.,"Ranged in my mirror, cards, with burnish'd ends,"
259,POEMS.,Shall show the whole nobility my friends;
260,POEMS.,"That happy host with whom I choose to dine,"
261,POEMS.,"Shall make set-parties, give his-choicest wine;"
262,POEMS.,And age and infancy shall gape to see
263,POEMS.,"The lucky bard, and whisper ""That is he!"""
264,POEMS.,
265,POEMS.,"Poor youth! he print--and wakes, _to sleep no more_--"
266,POEMS.,"The world goes on, indifferent, as before;"
267,POEMS.,And the first notice of his metric skill
268,POEMS.,Comes in the likeness of--his printer's bill;
269,POEMS.,"To pen soft notes no fair enthusiast stirs,"
270,POEMS.,Except his laundress--and who values her's?
271,POEMS.,None but herself: for though the bard may burn
272,POEMS.,"Her _note_, she still expects one in return."
273,POEMS.,"The luckless maiden, all unblest shall sigh;"
274,POEMS.,His pocket _tome_ hath drawn his pockets dry.
275,POEMS.,His tragedy expires in peals of laughter;
276,POEMS.,And that soul-thrilling wish--to live hereafter--
277,POEMS.,"Gives way to one as hopeless quite, I fear,"
278,POEMS.,And far more needful--how to _live while here_.
279,POEMS.,"Where are ye now, divine illusions all;"
280,POEMS.,"Cheques, dinners, wines, admirers great and small!"
281,POEMS.,"Changed to two followers, terrible to see,"
282,POEMS.,"Who dog his walks, and whisper ""That is he!"""
283,POEMS.,
284,POEMS.,"Rhymesters attend! nor scorn & friendly hint,"
285,POEMS.,Restrain your _cacoëths_ fierce to print.
286,POEMS.,"But hark, _my_ printer's devil's at the door,"
287,POEMS.,My leisure cannot yield one moment more:
288,POEMS.,"Nor matters it, advice can ne'er restrain"
289,POEMS.,Madman or poet from his bent:--'tis vain
290,POEMS.,"To strive to point out colours to the blind,"
291,POEMS.,Or set men seeking what they _will not find_.

322,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,One leaf from that immortal wreath which shades
323,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"The Hero's living brow, or decks his urn?"
324,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Breathes there who does not triumph in the thought
325,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"That ""Nelson's language is his mother tongue,"""
326,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,And that St. Vincent's country is his own?
327,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Oh! these bright guerdons of renown are won
328,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,By means most palpable to sense and sight;
329,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,By days of peril and by nights of toil;
330,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"By Valour's long probation, closed at last"
331,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,In Victory's arms--consummated and seal'd
332,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,In deathless Glory and immortal Fame.
333,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,
334,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Musing I stand upon _his_ lowly grave,"
335,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Who, though he fought no battle--though he pour'd"
336,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"No hostile thunders on his country's foes,"
337,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Achieved for Britain triumphs, less array'd"
338,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"""In pomp and circumstance,"" nor visible"
339,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,To vulgar gaze--the triumphs of the _Mind_.
340,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,He nursed the elements of courage--he
341,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Supplied the aliment that feeds and guides
342,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,The daring spirit to its high emprise--
343,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"A nation's moral energies, by him"
344,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Directed, found a nobler end and aim."
345,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,He gave that high discriminating tone
346,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,That marks the Brave from mercenary tools--
347,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Features that separate a British Crew
348,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"From hireling bravoes, and from pirate hordes."
349,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,And yet no marble marks the spot where lies
350,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,The dust of DIBDIN;--no inscription speaks
351,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,A Nation's gratitude--a Bard's desert.
352,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,
353,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"The youthful Sailor on his midnight watch,"
354,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Fixing his gaze upon the tranquil moon,"
355,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Felt his heart soften as the thoughts of home
356,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Rush'd on his faithful memory;--then it was
357,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"In language meet, and in appropriate strains--"
358,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Strains which thy lyre had taught him--he pour'd forth
359,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"The feelings of his soul, and all was calm."

361,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Thy Spirit still presides in that carouse,"

363,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"And ""absent Wives and Sweethearts"" claim their right,"
364,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,With Woman's constancy thy songs are rife;
365,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,And this pure creed still teaches Man t' endure
366,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Privations, danger, and each form of death."
367,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,
368,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"When not a breath responded to the call,"
369,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,And Seamen whistled to the winds in vain;
370,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"When the loose canvass droop'd in lazy folds,"
371,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,And idle pennants dangled from the mast;--
372,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"There, in that trying moment, thou wert found"
373,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,To teach the hardest lesson man can learn--
374,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Passive endurance--and the breeze has sprung,"
375,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,As if obedient to the voice of Song:--
376,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,And yet unhonour'd here thy ashes lie!
377,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,
378,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,A nobler lesson learn'd the gallant Tar

383,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,O'er fallen foes to soften heart of oak.
384,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,
385,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,He turn'd the Fatalist's rash eye to Him
386,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,In whom the issues are of life and death;
387,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,He taught to whom the battle is--to whom
388,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"The victory belongs. His cherub, that aloft"
389,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Kept sleepless watch, was Providence--not Chance."
390,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,
391,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,And yet no honours are decreed for him--
392,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Friend of the Brave, thy memory cannot die!"
393,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Th'inquiring voice, that eagerly demands"
394,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Where rest thy ashes?--shall preserve thy fame.
395,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Thine immortality thyself hast wrought;--
396,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,"Familiar as the terms of art, thy verse,"
397,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Thine own peculiar words are still the mode
398,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,In which the Seaman aptly would express
399,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,His honest passions and his manly thoughts;

401,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Which speak his duty in the battle's front;
402,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,His parting whisper to the maid he loves
403,THE GRAVE OF DIBDIN.,Is breathed in eloquence he learned from thee;
