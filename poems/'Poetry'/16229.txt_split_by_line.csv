350,THE AFTER-ECHO,
351,THE AFTER-ECHO,
352,THE AFTER-ECHO,How long the echoes love to play
353,THE AFTER-ECHO,"Around the shore of silence, as a wave"
354,THE AFTER-ECHO,Retreating circles down the sand!
355,THE AFTER-ECHO,"One after one, with sweet delay,"
356,THE AFTER-ECHO,"The mellow sounds that cliff and island gave,"
357,THE AFTER-ECHO,"Have lingered in the crescent bay,"
358,THE AFTER-ECHO,"Until, by lightest breezes fanned,"
359,THE AFTER-ECHO,They float far off beyond the dying day
360,THE AFTER-ECHO,And leave it still as death.
361,THE AFTER-ECHO,"But hark,--"
362,THE AFTER-ECHO,Another singing breath
363,THE AFTER-ECHO,Comes from the edge of dark;
364,THE AFTER-ECHO,A note as clear and slow
365,THE AFTER-ECHO,"As falls from some enchanted bell,"
366,THE AFTER-ECHO,"Or spirit, passing from the world below,"
367,THE AFTER-ECHO,"That whispers back, Farewell."
368,THE AFTER-ECHO,
369,THE AFTER-ECHO,"So in the heart,"
370,THE AFTER-ECHO,"When, fading slowly down the past,"
371,THE AFTER-ECHO,"Fond memories depart,"
372,THE AFTER-ECHO,And each that leaves it seems the last;
373,THE AFTER-ECHO,"Long after all the rest are flown,"
374,THE AFTER-ECHO,"Returns a solitary tone,--"
375,THE AFTER-ECHO,"The after-echo of departed years,--"
376,THE AFTER-ECHO,And touches all the soul to tears.

384,DULCIORA,
385,DULCIORA,A tear that trembles for a little while
386,DULCIORA,"Upon the trembling eyelid, till the world"
387,DULCIORA,"Wavers within its circle like a dream,"
388,DULCIORA,Holds more of meaning in its narrow orb
389,DULCIORA,Than all the distant landscape that it blurs.
390,DULCIORA,
391,DULCIORA,"A smile that hovers round a mouth beloved,"
392,DULCIORA,"Like the faint pulsing of the Northern Light,"
393,DULCIORA,And grows in silence to an amber dawn
394,DULCIORA,"Born in the sweetest depths of trustful eyes,"
395,DULCIORA,Is dearer to the soul than sun or star.
396,DULCIORA,
397,DULCIORA,A joy that falls into the hollow heart
398,DULCIORA,"From some far-lifted height of love unseen,"
399,DULCIORA,"Unknown, makes a more perfect melody"
400,DULCIORA,"Than hidden brooks that murmur in the dusk,"
401,DULCIORA,Or fall athwart the cliff with wavering gleam.
402,DULCIORA,
403,DULCIORA,"Ah, not for their own sake are earth and sky"
404,DULCIORA,"And the fair ministries of Nature dear,"
405,DULCIORA,But as they set themselves unto the tune
406,DULCIORA,That fills our life; as light mysterious
407,DULCIORA,Flows from within and glorifies the world.
408,DULCIORA,
409,DULCIORA,"For so a common wayside blossom, touched"
410,DULCIORA,"With tender thought, assumes a grace more sweet"
411,DULCIORA,Than crowns the royal lily of the South;
412,DULCIORA,And so a well-remembered perfume seems
413,DULCIORA,The breath of one who breathes in Paradise.

426,THE GLACIER,"At dawn in silence moves the mighty stream,"
427,THE GLACIER,The silver-crested waves no murmur make;
428,THE GLACIER,But far away the avalanches wake
429,THE GLACIER,"The rumbling echoes, dull as in a dream;"
430,THE GLACIER,"Their momentary thunders, dying, seem"
431,THE GLACIER,"To fall into the stillness, flake by flake,"
432,THE GLACIER,And leave the hollow air with naught to break
433,THE GLACIER,The frozen spell of solitude supreme.
434,THE GLACIER,
435,THE GLACIER,At noon unnumbered rills begin to spring
436,THE GLACIER,"Beneath the burning sun, and all the walls"
437,THE GLACIER,Of all the ocean-blue crevasses ring
438,THE GLACIER,With liquid lyrics of their waterfalls;
439,THE GLACIER,As if a poet's heart had felt the glow
440,THE GLACIER,"Of sovereign love, and song began to flow."

449,THE SNOW-FIELD,"White Death had laid his pall upon the plain,"
450,THE SNOW-FIELD,And crowned the mountain-peaks like monarchs dead;
451,THE SNOW-FIELD,The vault of heaven was glaring overhead
452,THE SNOW-FIELD,With pitiless light that filled my eyes with pain;
453,THE SNOW-FIELD,"And while I vainly longed, and looked in vain"
454,THE SNOW-FIELD,"For sign or trace of life, my spirit said,"
455,THE SNOW-FIELD,"""Shall any living thing that dares to tread"
456,THE SNOW-FIELD,"This royal lair of Death escape again?"""
457,THE SNOW-FIELD,
458,THE SNOW-FIELD,But even then I saw before my feet
459,THE SNOW-FIELD,A line of pointed footprints in the snow:
460,THE SNOW-FIELD,"Some roving chamois, but an hour ago,"
461,THE SNOW-FIELD,"Had passed this way along his journey fleet,"
462,THE SNOW-FIELD,And left a message from a friend unknown
463,THE SNOW-FIELD,"To cheer my pilgrim-heart, no more alone."

472,MOVING BELLS,"I love the hour that comes, with dusky hair"
473,MOVING BELLS,"And dewy feet, along the Alpine dells,"
474,MOVING BELLS,To lead the cattle forth. A thousand bells
475,MOVING BELLS,Go chiming after her across the fair
476,MOVING BELLS,"And flowery uplands, while the rosy flare"
477,MOVING BELLS,"Of sunset on the snowy mountain dwells,"
478,MOVING BELLS,"And valleys darken, and the drowsy spells"
479,MOVING BELLS,Of peace are woven through the purple air.
480,MOVING BELLS,
481,MOVING BELLS,Dear is the magic of this hour: she seems
482,MOVING BELLS,"To walk before the dark by falling rills,"
483,MOVING BELLS,And lend a sweeter song to hidden streams;
484,MOVING BELLS,"She opens all the doors of night, and fills"
485,MOVING BELLS,"With moving bells the music of my dreams,"

1361,I,
1362,I,"Ah, who will tell me, in these leaden days,"
1363,I,"Why the sweet Spring delays,"
1364,I,"And where she hides,--the dear desire"
1365,I,Of every heart that longs
1366,I,"For bloom, and fragrance, and the ruby fire"
1367,I,"Of maple-buds along the misty hills,"
1368,I,And that immortal call which fills
1369,I,The waiting wood with songs?
1370,I,"The snow-drops came so long ago,"
1371,I,It seemed that Spring was near!
1372,I,But then returned the snow
1373,I,"With biting winds, and earth grew sere,"
1374,I,And sullen clouds drooped low
1375,I,To veil the sadness of a hope deferred:
1376,I,"Then rain, rain, rain, incessant rain"
1377,I,"Beat on the window-pane,"
1378,I,Through which I watched the solitary bird
1379,I,"That braved the tempest, buffeted and tossed"
1380,I,With rumpled feathers down the wind again.
1381,I,"Oh, were the seeds all lost"
1382,I,When winter laid the wild flowers in their tomb?
1383,I,I searched the woods in vain
1384,I,"For blue hepaticas, and trilliums white,"
1385,I,"And trailing arbutus, the Spring's delight,"
1386,I,Starring the withered leaves with rosy bloom.
1387,I,But every night the frost
1388,I,"To all my longing spoke a silent nay,"
1389,I,And told me Spring was far away.
1390,I,"Even the robins were too cold to sing,"
1391,I,"Except a broken and discouraged note,--"
1392,I,"Only the tuneful sparrow, on whose throat"
1393,I,"Music has put her triple finger-print,"
1394,I,"Lifted his head and sang my heart a hint,--"

1401,II,"For all delay! What sweetness treasured up,"
1402,II,What wine of joy that blends
1403,II,"A hundred flavours in a single cup,"
1404,II,Is poured into this perfect day!
1405,II,"For look, sweet heart, here are the early flowers"
1406,II,"That lingered on their way,"
1407,II,"Thronging in haste to kiss the feet of May,"
1408,II,"Entangled with the bloom of later hours,--"
1409,II,"Anemones and cinque-foils, violets blue"
1410,II,"And white, and iris richly gleaming through"
1411,II,"The grasses of the meadow, and a blaze"
1412,II,"Of butter-cups and daisies in the field,"
1413,II,"Filling the air with praise,"
1414,II,As if a chime of golden bells had pealed!
1415,II,The frozen songs within the breast
1416,II,"Of silent birds that hid in leafless woods,"
1417,II,Melt into rippling floods
1418,II,Of gladness unrepressed.
1419,II,"Now oriole and bluebird, thrush and lark,"
1420,II,"Warbler and wren and vireo,"
1421,II,Mingle their melody; the living spark
1422,II,"Of Love has touched the fuel of desire,"
1423,II,And every heart leaps up in singing fire.
1424,II,It seems as if the land
1425,II,"Were breathing deep beneath the sun's caress,"
1426,II,"Trembling with tenderness,"
1427,II,"While all the woods expand,"
1428,II,"In shimmering clouds of rose and gold and green,"
1429,II,To veil a joy too sacred to be seen.

1435,III,"True love, long sought and found at last,"
1436,III,And lead me deep into the Spring divine
1437,III,That makes amends for all the wintry past.
1438,III,For all the flowers and songs I feared to miss
1439,III,Arrive with you;
1440,III,And in the lingering pressure of your kiss
1441,III,My dreams come true;
1442,III,And in the promise of your generous eyes
1443,III,I read the mystic sign
1444,III,Of joy more perfect made
1445,III,"Because so long delayed,"
1446,III,And bliss enhanced by rapture of surprise.
1447,III,"Ah, think not early love alone is strong;"
1448,III,He loveth best whose heart has learned to wait:
1449,III,"Dear messenger of Spring that tarried long,"
1450,III,You're doubly dear because you come so late.

1762,DAYBREAK,Of perished æons and forgotten things.
1763,DAYBREAK,My sight is baffled by the wide array
1764,DAYBREAK,Of countless forms: my vision reels and swims
1765,DAYBREAK,"Above them, like a bird in whirling winds."
1766,DAYBREAK,Yet no confusion fills the awful chasm;
1767,DAYBREAK,But spacious order and a sense of peace
1768,DAYBREAK,Brood over all. For every shape that looms
1769,DAYBREAK,"Majestic in the throng, is set apart"
1770,DAYBREAK,"From all the others by its far-flung shade,"
1771,DAYBREAK,"Blue, blue, as if a mountain-lake were there."

1773,DAYBREAK,"How still it is! Dear God, I hardly dare"
1774,DAYBREAK,"To breathe, for fear the fathomless abyss"
1775,DAYBREAK,Will draw me down into eternal sleep.
1776,DAYBREAK,
1777,DAYBREAK,What force has formed this masterpiece of awe?
1778,DAYBREAK,What hands have wrought these wonders in the waste?
1779,DAYBREAK,"O river, gleaming in the narrow rift"
1780,DAYBREAK,"Of gloom that cleaves the valley's nether deep,--"
1781,DAYBREAK,"Fierce Colorado, prisoned by thy toil,"
1782,DAYBREAK,"And blindly toiling still to reach the sea,--"
1783,DAYBREAK,"Thy waters, gathered from the snows and springs"
1784,DAYBREAK,"Amid the Utah hills, have carved this road"
1785,DAYBREAK,Of glory to the Californian Gulf.
1786,DAYBREAK,"But now, O sunken stream, thy splendour lost,"
1787,DAYBREAK,"'Twixt iron walls thou rollest turbid waves,"
1788,DAYBREAK,Too far away to make their fury heard!
1789,DAYBREAK,
1790,DAYBREAK,"At sight of thee, thou sullen labouring slave"
1791,DAYBREAK,"Of gravitation,--yellow torrent poured"

1793,DAYBREAK,Through thrice a hundred centuries of slow
1794,DAYBREAK,"Fallings and liftings of the crust of Earth,--"
1795,DAYBREAK,At sight of thee my spirit sinks and fails.
1796,DAYBREAK,Art thou alone the Maker? Is the blind
1797,DAYBREAK,Unconscious power that drew thee dumbly down
1798,DAYBREAK,"To cut this gash across the layered globe,"
1799,DAYBREAK,The sole creative cause of all I see?
1800,DAYBREAK,Are force and matter all? The rest a dream?
1801,DAYBREAK,
1802,DAYBREAK,"Then is thy gorge a canyon of despair,"
1803,DAYBREAK,"A prison for the soul of man, a grave"
1804,DAYBREAK,Of all his dearest daring hopes! The world
1805,DAYBREAK,"Wherein we live and move is meaningless,"
1806,DAYBREAK,No spirit here to answer to our own!
1807,DAYBREAK,The stars without a guide: The chance-born Earth
1808,DAYBREAK,"Adrift in space, no Captain on the ship:"
1809,DAYBREAK,Nothing in all the universe to prove
1810,DAYBREAK,Eternal wisdom and eternal love!
1811,DAYBREAK,"And man, the latest accident of Time,--"
1812,DAYBREAK,"Who thinks he loves, and longs to understand,"
1813,DAYBREAK,"Who vainly suffers, and in vain is brave,"
1814,DAYBREAK,"Who dupes his heart with immortality,--"
1815,DAYBREAK,"Man is a living lie,--a bitter jest"
1816,DAYBREAK,"Upon himself,--a conscious grain of sand"
1817,DAYBREAK,"Lost in a desert of unconsciousness,"
1818,DAYBREAK,Thirsting for God and mocked by his own thirst.

1821,DAYBREAK,Thou fairest offspring of Omnipotence
1822,DAYBREAK,"Inhabiting this lofty lone abode,"
1823,DAYBREAK,Speak to my heart again and set me free
1824,DAYBREAK,From all these doubts that darken earth and heaven!
1825,DAYBREAK,Who sent thee forth into the wilderness
1826,DAYBREAK,To bless and comfort all who see thy face?
1827,DAYBREAK,Who clad thee in this more than royal robe
1828,DAYBREAK,Of rainbows? Who designed these jewelled thrones
1829,DAYBREAK,"For thee, and wrought these glittering palaces?"
1830,DAYBREAK,Who gave thee power upon the soul of man
1831,DAYBREAK,To lift him up through wonder into joy?
1832,DAYBREAK,"God! let the radiant cliffs bear witness, God!"
1833,DAYBREAK,"Let all the shining pillars signal, God!"
1834,DAYBREAK,"He only, on the mystic loom of light."
1835,DAYBREAK,Hath woven webs of loveliness to clothe
1836,DAYBREAK,His most majestic works: and He alone
1837,DAYBREAK,Hath delicately wrought the cactus-flower
1838,DAYBREAK,To star the desert floor with rosy bloom.
1839,DAYBREAK,
1840,DAYBREAK,"O Beauty, handiwork of the Most High,"
1841,DAYBREAK,"Where'er thou art He tells his Love to man,"

1843,DAYBREAK,
1844,DAYBREAK,"Now, far beyond all language and all art"
1845,DAYBREAK,"In thy wild splendour, Canyon marvellous,"
1846,DAYBREAK,The secret of thy stillness lies unveiled
1847,DAYBREAK,In wordless worship! This is holy ground;
1848,DAYBREAK,"Thou art no grave, no prison, but a shrine."
1849,DAYBREAK,"Garden of Temples filled with Silent Praise,"
1850,DAYBREAK,If God were blind thy Beauty could not be!

2214,LEGEND,"Brother-men who look for Jesus, long to see Him close and clear,"
2215,LEGEND,"Hearken to the tale of Felix, how he found the Master near."
2216,LEGEND,
2217,LEGEND,"Born in Egypt, 'neath the shadow of the crumbling gods of night,"
2218,LEGEND,"He forsook the ancient darkness, turned his young heart toward the Light."
2219,LEGEND,
2220,LEGEND,"Seeking Christ, in vain he waited for the vision of the Lord;"
2221,LEGEND,Vainly pondered many volumes where the creeds of men were stored;
2222,LEGEND,
2223,LEGEND,"Vainly shut himself in silence, keeping vigil night and day;"
2224,LEGEND,Vainly haunted shrines and churches where the Christians came to pray.
2225,LEGEND,
2226,LEGEND,"One by one he dropped the duties of the common life of care,"
2227,LEGEND,"Broke the human ties that bound him, laid his spirit waste and bare,"
2228,LEGEND,
2229,LEGEND,"Hoping that the Lord would enter that deserted dwelling-place,"
2230,LEGEND,And reward the loss of all things with the vision of His face.
2231,LEGEND,
2232,LEGEND,Still the blessed vision tarried; still the light was unrevealed;
2233,LEGEND,"Still the Master, dim and distant, kept His countenance concealed."
2234,LEGEND,
2235,LEGEND,"Fainter grew the hope of finding, wearier grew the fruitless quest;"
2236,LEGEND,"Prayer and penitence and fasting gave no comfort, brought no rest."
2237,LEGEND,
2238,LEGEND,"Lingering in the darkened temple, ere the lamp of faith went out,"
2239,LEGEND,"Felix knelt before the altar, lonely, sad, and full of doubt."
2240,LEGEND,
2241,LEGEND,"""Hear me, O my Lord and Master,"" from the altar-step he cried,"
2242,LEGEND,"""Let my one desire be granted, let my hope be satisfied!"
2243,LEGEND,
2244,LEGEND,"""Only once I long to see Thee, in the fulness of Thy grace:"
2245,LEGEND,"Break the clouds that now enfold Thee, with the sunrise of Thy face!"
2246,LEGEND,
2247,LEGEND,"""All that men desire and treasure have I counted loss for Thee;"
2248,LEGEND,"Every hope have I forsaken, save this one, my Lord to see."
2249,LEGEND,
2250,LEGEND,"""Loosed the sacred bands of friendship, solitary stands my heart;"
2251,LEGEND,Thou shalt be my sole companion when I see Thee as Thou art.
2252,LEGEND,
2253,LEGEND,"""From Thy distant throne in glory, flash upon my inward sight,"
2254,LEGEND,Fill the midnight of my spirit with the splendour of Thy light.
2255,LEGEND,
2256,LEGEND,"""All Thine other gifts and blessings, common mercies, I disown;"
2257,LEGEND,"Separated from my brothers, I would see Thy face alone."
2258,LEGEND,
2259,LEGEND,"""I have watched and I have waited as one waiteth for the morn:"
2260,LEGEND,"Still the veil is never lifted, still Thou leavest me forlorn."
2261,LEGEND,
2262,LEGEND,"""Now I seek Thee in the desert, where the holy hermits dwell;"
2263,LEGEND,"There, beside the saint Serapion, I will find a lonely cell."
2264,LEGEND,
2265,LEGEND,"""There at last Thou wilt be gracious; there Thy presence,"
2266,LEGEND,"long-concealed,"
2267,LEGEND,In the solitude and silence to my heart shall be revealed.
2268,LEGEND,
2269,LEGEND,"""Thou wilt come, at dawn or twilight, o'er the rolling waves of sand;"
2270,LEGEND,"I shall see Thee close beside me, I shall touch Thy pierced hand."
2271,LEGEND,
2272,LEGEND,"""Lo, Thy pilgrim kneels before Thee; bless my journey with a word;"
2273,LEGEND,"Tell me now that if I follow, I shall find Thee, O my Lord!"""
2274,LEGEND,
2275,LEGEND,"Felix listened: through the darkness, like a murmur of the wind,"
2276,LEGEND,"Came a gentle sound of stillness: ""Never faint, and thou shalt find."""
2277,LEGEND,
2278,LEGEND,"Long and toilsome was his journey through the heavy land of heat,"
2279,LEGEND,"Egypt's blazing sun above him, blistering sand beneath his feet."
2280,LEGEND,
2281,LEGEND,"Patiently he plodded onward, from the pathway never erred,"
2282,LEGEND,Till he reached the river-headland called the Mountain of the Bird.
2283,LEGEND,
2284,LEGEND,"There the tribes of air assemble, once a year, their noisy flock,"
2285,LEGEND,"Then, departing, leave a sentinel perched upon the highest rock."
2286,LEGEND,
2287,LEGEND,"Far away, on joyful pinions, over land and sea they fly;"
2288,LEGEND,But the watcher on the summit lonely stands against the sky.
2289,LEGEND,
2290,LEGEND,There the eremite Serapion in a cave had made his bed;
2291,LEGEND,"There the faithful bands of pilgrims sought his blessing, brought him"
2292,LEGEND,bread.
2293,LEGEND,
2294,LEGEND,"Month by month, in deep seclusion, hidden in the rocky cleft,"
2295,LEGEND,"Dwelt the hermit, fasting, praying; once a year the cave he left."
2296,LEGEND,
2297,LEGEND,"On that day a happy pilgrim, chosen out of all the band,"
2298,LEGEND,Won a special sign of favour from the holy hermit's hand.
2299,LEGEND,
2300,LEGEND,"Underneath the narrow window, at the doorway closely sealed,"
2301,LEGEND,"While the afterglow of sunset deepened round him, Felix kneeled."
2302,LEGEND,
2303,LEGEND,"""Man of God, of men most holy, thou whose gifts cannot be priced!"
2304,LEGEND,"Grant me thy most precious guerdon; tell me how to find the Christ."""
2305,LEGEND,
2306,LEGEND,"Breathless, Felix bent and listened, but no answering voice he heard;"
2307,LEGEND,"Darkness folded, dumb and deathlike, round the Mountain of the Bird."
2308,LEGEND,
2309,LEGEND,"Then he said, ""The saint is silent; he would teach my soul to wait:"
2310,LEGEND,"I will tarry here in patience, like a beggar at his gate."""
2311,LEGEND,
2312,LEGEND,"Near the dwelling of the hermit Felix found a rude abode,"
2313,LEGEND,"In a shallow tomb deserted, close beside the pilgrim-road."
2314,LEGEND,
2315,LEGEND,"So the faithful pilgrims saw him waiting there without complaint,--"
2316,LEGEND,"Soon they learned to call him holy, fed him as they fed the saint."
2317,LEGEND,
2318,LEGEND,"Day by day he watched the sunrise flood the distant plain with gold,"
2319,LEGEND,"While the River Nile beneath him, silvery coiling, sea-ward rolled."
2320,LEGEND,
2321,LEGEND,"Night by night he saw the planets range their glittering court on high,"
2322,LEGEND,"Saw the moon, with queenly motion, mount her throne and rule the sky."
2323,LEGEND,
2324,LEGEND,"Morn advanced and midnight fled, in visionary pomp attired;"
2325,LEGEND,Never morn and never midnight brought the vision long-desired.
2326,LEGEND,
2327,LEGEND,Now at last the day is dawning when Serapion makes his gift;
2328,LEGEND,"Felix kneels before the threshold, hardly dares his eyes to lift."
2329,LEGEND,
2330,LEGEND,"Now the cavern door uncloses, now the saint above him stands,"
2331,LEGEND,"Blesses him without a word, and leaves a token in his hands."
2332,LEGEND,
2333,LEGEND,"'Tis the guerdon of thy waiting! Look, thou happy pilgrim, look!"
2334,LEGEND,Nothing but a tattered fragment of an old papyrus book.
2335,LEGEND,
2336,LEGEND,Read! perchance the clue to guide thee hidden in the words may lie:
2337,LEGEND,"""_Raise the stone, and thou shalt find me; cleave the wood, and there"
2338,LEGEND,"am I._"""
2339,LEGEND,
2340,LEGEND,Can it be the mighty Master spake such simple words as these?
2341,LEGEND,Can it be that men must seek Him at their toil 'mid rocks and trees?
2342,LEGEND,
2343,LEGEND,"Disappointed, heavy-hearted, from the Mountain of the Bird"
2344,LEGEND,"Felix mournfully descended, questioning the Master's word."
2345,LEGEND,
2346,LEGEND,"Not for him a sacred dwelling, far above the haunts of men:"
2347,LEGEND,He must turn his footsteps backward to the common life again.
2348,LEGEND,
2349,LEGEND,"From a quarry near the river, hollowed out amid the hills,"
2350,LEGEND,"Rose the clattering voice of labour, clanking hammers, clinking drills."
2351,LEGEND,
2352,LEGEND,"Dust, and noise, and hot confusion made a Babel of the spot:"
2353,LEGEND,"There, among the lowliest workers, Felix sought and found his lot."
2354,LEGEND,
2355,LEGEND,"Now he swung the ponderous mallet, smote the iron in the rock--"
2356,LEGEND,"Muscles quivering, tingling, throbbing--blow on blow and shock on shock;"
2357,LEGEND,
2358,LEGEND,"Now he drove the willow wedges, wet them till they swelled and split,"
2359,LEGEND,"With their silent strength, the fragment, sent it thundering down the"
2360,LEGEND,pit.
2361,LEGEND,
2362,LEGEND,Now the groaning tackle raised it; now the rollers made it slide;
2363,LEGEND,"Harnessed men, like beasts of burden, drew it to the river-side."
2364,LEGEND,
2365,LEGEND,"Now the palm-trees must be riven, massive timbers hewn and dressed;"
2366,LEGEND,Rafts to bear the stones in safety on the rushing river's breast.
2367,LEGEND,
2368,LEGEND,"Axe and auger, saw and chisel, wrought the will of man in wood:"
2369,LEGEND,"'Mid the many-handed labour Felix toiled, and found it good."
2370,LEGEND,
2371,LEGEND,Every day the blood ran fleeter through his limbs and round his heart;
2372,LEGEND,"Every night he slept the sweeter, knowing he had done his part."
2373,LEGEND,
2374,LEGEND,"Dreams of solitary saintship faded from him; but, instead,"
2375,LEGEND,Came a sense of daily comfort in the toil for daily bread.
2376,LEGEND,
2377,LEGEND,"Far away, across the river, gleamed the white walls of the town"
2378,LEGEND,Whither all the stones and timbers day by day were floated down.
2379,LEGEND,
2380,LEGEND,"There the workman saw his labour taking form and bearing fruit,"
2381,LEGEND,Like a tree with splendid branches rising from a humble root.
2382,LEGEND,
2383,LEGEND,"Looking at the distant city, temples, houses, domes, and towers,"
2384,LEGEND,"Felix cried in exultation: ""All that mighty work is ours."
2385,LEGEND,
2386,LEGEND,"""Every toiler in the quarry, every builder on the shore,"
2387,LEGEND,"Every chopper in the palm-grove, every raftsman at the oar,"
2388,LEGEND,
2389,LEGEND,"""Hewing wood and drawing water, splitting stones and cleaving sod,"
2390,LEGEND,"All the dusty ranks of labour, in the regiment of God,"
2391,LEGEND,
2392,LEGEND,"""March together toward His triumph, do the task His hands prepare:"
2393,LEGEND,"Honest toil is holy service; faithful work is praise and prayer."""
2394,LEGEND,
2395,LEGEND,While he bore the heat and burden Felix felt the sense of rest
2396,LEGEND,"Flowing softly like a fountain, deep within his weary breast;"
2397,LEGEND,
2398,LEGEND,"Felt the brotherhood of labour, rising round him like a tide,"
2399,LEGEND,Overflow his heart and join him to the workers at his side.
2400,LEGEND,
2401,LEGEND,"Oft he cheered them with his singing at the breaking of the light,"
2402,LEGEND,"Told them tales of Christ at noonday, taught them words of prayer at"
2403,LEGEND,night.
2404,LEGEND,
2405,LEGEND,"Once he bent above a comrade fainting in the mid-day heat,"
2406,LEGEND,"Sheltered him with woven palm-leaves, gave him water, cool and sweet."
2407,LEGEND,
2408,LEGEND,"Then it seemed, for one swift moment, secret radiance filled the place;"
2409,LEGEND,Underneath the green palm-branches flashed a look of Jesus' face.
2410,LEGEND,
2411,LEGEND,"Once again, a raftsman, slipping, plunged beneath the stream and sank;"
2412,LEGEND,"Swiftly Felix leaped to rescue, caught him, drew him toward the bank--"
2413,LEGEND,
2414,LEGEND,"Battling with the cruel river, using all his strength to save--"
2415,LEGEND,Did he dream? or was there One beside him walking on the wave?
2416,LEGEND,
2417,LEGEND,"Now at last the work was ended, grove deserted, quarry stilled;"
2418,LEGEND,Felix journeyed to the city that his hands had helped to build.
2419,LEGEND,
2420,LEGEND,"In the darkness of the temple, at the closing hour of day,"
2421,LEGEND,"As of old he sought the altar, as of old he knelt to pray:"
2422,LEGEND,
2423,LEGEND,"""Hear me, O Thou hidden Master! Thou hast sent a word to me;"
2424,LEGEND,It is written--Thy commandment--I have kept it faithfully.
2425,LEGEND,
2426,LEGEND,"""Thou hast bid me leave the visions of the solitary life,"
2427,LEGEND,"Bear my part in human labour, take my share in human strife."
2428,LEGEND,
2429,LEGEND,"""I have done Thy bidding, Master; raised the rock and felled the tree,"
2430,LEGEND,"Swung the axe and plied the hammer, working every day for Thee."
2431,LEGEND,
2432,LEGEND,"""Once it seemed I saw Thy presence through the bending palm-leaves gleam;"
2433,LEGEND,"Once upon the flowing water--Nay, I know not; 'twas a dream!"
2434,LEGEND,
2435,LEGEND,"""This I know: Thou hast been near me: more than this I dare not ask."
2436,LEGEND,"Though I see Thee not, I love Thee. Let me do Thy humblest task!"""
2437,LEGEND,
2438,LEGEND,Through the dimness of the temple slowly dawned a mystic light;
2439,LEGEND,"There the Master stood in glory, manifest to mortal sight:"
2440,LEGEND,
2441,LEGEND,"Hands that bore the mark of labour, brow that bore the print of care;"
2442,LEGEND,"Hands of power, divinely tender; brow of light, divinely fair."
2443,LEGEND,
2444,LEGEND,"""Hearken, good and faithful servant, true disciple, loyal friend!"
2445,LEGEND,Thou hast followed me and found me; I will keep thee to the end.
2446,LEGEND,
2447,LEGEND,"""Well I know thy toil and trouble; often weary, fainting, worn,"
2448,LEGEND,"I have lived the life of labour, heavy burdens I have borne."
2449,LEGEND,
2450,LEGEND,"""Never in a prince's palace have I slept on golden bed,"
2451,LEGEND,Never in a hermit's cavern have I eaten unearned bread.
2452,LEGEND,
2453,LEGEND,"""Born within a lowly stable, where the cattle round me stood,"
2454,LEGEND,"Trained a carpenter in Nazareth, I have toiled, and found it good."
2455,LEGEND,
2456,LEGEND,"""They who tread the path of labour follow where my feet have trod;"
2457,LEGEND,They who work without complaining do the holy will of God.
2458,LEGEND,
2459,LEGEND,"""Where the many toil together, there am I among my own;"
2460,LEGEND,"Where the tired workman sleepeth, there am I with him alone."
2461,LEGEND,
2462,LEGEND,"""I, the peace that passeth knowledge, dwell amid the daily strife;"
2463,LEGEND,"I, the bread of heaven, am broken in the sacrament of life."
2464,LEGEND,
2465,LEGEND,"""Every task, however simple, sets the soul that does it free;"
2466,LEGEND,"Every deed of love and mercy, done to man, is done to me."
2467,LEGEND,
2468,LEGEND,"""Thou hast learned the open secret; thou hast come to me for rest;"
2469,LEGEND,"With thy burden, in thy labour, thou art Felix, doubly blest."
2470,LEGEND,
2471,LEGEND,"""Nevermore thou needest seek me; I am with thee everywhere;"
2472,LEGEND,"_Raise the stone, and thou shall find me; cleave the wood, and"

2514,I,
2515,I,"A silent world,--yet full of vital joy"
2516,I,"Uttered in rhythmic movements manifold,"
2517,I,And sunbeams flashing on the face of things
2518,I,"Like sudden smilings of divine delight,--"
2519,I,"A world of many sorrows too, revealed"
2520,I,In fading flowers and withering leaves and dark
2521,I,"Tear-laden clouds, and tearless, clinging mists"
2522,I,"That hung above the earth too sad to weep,--"
2523,I,"A world of fluent change, and changeless flow,"
2524,I,"And infinite suggestion of new thought,"
2525,I,"Reflected in the crystal of the heart,--"
2526,I,"A world of many meanings but no words,"
2527,I,A silent world was Vera's home.
2528,I,For her
2529,I,The inner doors of sound were closely sealed
2530,I,"The outer portals, delicate as shells"
2531,I,"Suffused with faintest rose of far-off morn,"
2532,I,"Like underglow of daybreak in the sea,--"
2533,I,"The ear-gates of the garden of her soul,"
2534,I,"Shaded by drooping tendrils of brown hair,--"
2535,I,"Waited in vain for messengers to pass,"
2536,I,"And thread the labyrinth with flying feet,"
2537,I,"And swiftly knock upon the inmost door,"
2538,I,"And enter in, and speak the mystic word."
2539,I,But through those gates no message ever came.
2540,I,"Only with eyes did she behold and see,--"
2541,I,With eyes as luminous and bright and brown
2542,I,"As waters of a woodland river,--eyes"
2543,I,"That questioned so they almost seemed to speak,"
2544,I,"And answered so they almost seemed to hear,--"
2545,I,Only with wondering eyes did she behold
2546,I,The silent splendour of a living world.
2547,I,
2548,I,She saw the great wind ranging freely down
2549,I,"Interminable archways of the wood,"
2550,I,While tossing boughs and bending tree-tops hailed
2551,I,"His coming: but no sea-toned voice of pines,"
2552,I,"No roaring of the oaks, no silvery song"
2553,I,"Of poplars or of birches, followed him."
2554,I,He passed; they waved their arms and clapped their hands;
2555,I,There was no sound.
2556,I,The torrents from the hills
2557,I,"Leaped down their rocky pathways, like wild steeds"
2558,I,Breaking the yoke and shaking manes of foam.
2559,I,"The lowland brooks coiled smoothly through the fields,"
2560,I,And softly spread themselves in glistening lakes
2561,I,Whose ripples merrily danced among the reeds.
2562,I,The standing waves that ever keep their place
2563,I,"In the swift rapids, curled upon themselves,"
2564,I,And seemed about to break and never broke;
2565,I,And all the wandering waves that fill the sea
2566,I,"Came buffeting in along the stony shore,"
2567,I,"Or plunging in along the level sands,"
2568,I,Or creeping in along the winding creeks
2569,I,And inlets. Yet from all the ceaseless flow
2570,I,And turmoil of the restless element
2571,I,Came neither song of joy nor sob of grief;
2572,I,"For there were many waters, but no voice."
2573,I,
2574,I,Silent the actors all on Nature's stage
2575,I,"Performed their parts before her watchful eyes,"
2576,I,"Coming and going, making war and love,"
2577,I,"Working and playing, all without a sound."
2578,I,The oxen drew their load with swaying necks;
2579,I,The cows came sauntering home along the lane;
2580,I,The nodding sheep were led from field to fold
2581,I,In mute obedience. Down the woodland track
2582,I,The hounds with panting sides and lolling tongues
2583,I,Pursued their flying prey in noiseless haste.
2584,I,"The birds, the most alive of living things,"
2585,I,"Mated, and built their nests, and reared their young,"
2586,I,And swam the flood of air like tiny ships
2587,I,"Rising and falling over unseen waves,"
2588,I,"And, gathering in great navies, bore away"
2589,I,"To North or South, without a note of song."
2590,I,
2591,I,All these were Vera's playmates; and she loved
2592,I,"To watch them, wondering oftentimes how well"
2593,I,"They knew their parts, and how the drama moved"
2594,I,"So swiftly, smoothly on from scene to scene"
2595,I,Without confusion. But she sometimes dreamed
2596,I,There must be something hidden in the play
2597,I,"Unknown to her, an utterance of life"
2598,I,More clear than action and more deep than looks.
2599,I,And this she felt most deeply when she watched
2600,I,"Her human comrades and the throngs of men,"
2601,I,Who met and parted oft with moving lips
2602,I,That had a meaning more than she could see.
2603,I,"She saw a lover bend above a maid,"
2604,I,With moving lips; and though he touched her not
2605,I,A sudden rose of joy bloomed in her face.
2606,I,She saw a hater stand before his foe
2607,I,And move his lips; whereat the other shrank
2608,I,As if he had been smitten on the mouth.
2609,I,She saw the regiments of toiling men
2610,I,Marshalled in ranks and led by moving lips.
2611,I,And once she saw a sight more strange than all:
2612,I,A crowd of people sitting charmed and still
2613,I,Around a little company of men
2614,I,"Who touched their hands in measured, rhythmic time"
2615,I,To curious instruments; a woman stood
2616,I,"Among them, with bright eyes and heaving breast,"
2617,I,And lifted up her face and moved her lips.
2618,I,"Then Vera wondered at the idle play,"
2619,I,"But when she looked around, she saw the glow"
2620,I,"Of deep delight on every face, as if"
2621,I,Some visitor from a celestial world
2622,I,Had brought glad tidings. But to her alone
2623,I,"No angel entered, for the choir of sound"
2624,I,"Was vacant in the temple of her soul,"
2625,I,And worship lacked her golden crown of song.
2626,I,
2627,I,So when by vision baffled and perplexed
2628,I,"She saw that all the world could not be seen,"
2629,I,And knew she could not know the whole of life
2630,I,"Unless a hidden gate should be unsealed,"
2631,I,She felt imprisoned. In her heart there grew
2632,I,"The bitter creeping plant of discontent,"
2633,I,"The plant that only grows in prison soil,"
2634,I,Whose root is hunger and whose fruit is pain.
2635,I,The springs of still delight and tranquil joy
2636,I,Were drained as dry as desert dust to feed
2637,I,"That never-flowering vine, whose tendrils clung"
2638,I,With strangling touch around the bloom of life
2639,I,And made it wither. Vera could not rest
2640,I,Within the limits of her silent world;
2641,I,Along its dumb and desolate paths she roamed
2642,I,"A captive, looking sadly for escape."
2643,I,
2644,I,"Now in those distant days, and in that land"
2645,I,"Remote, there lived a Master wonderful,"
2646,I,"Who knew the secret of all life, and could,"
2647,I,"With gentle touches and with potent words,"
2648,I,"Open all gates that ever had been sealed,"
2649,I,And loose all prisoners whom Fate had bound.
2650,I,"Obscure he dwelt, not in the wilderness,"
2651,I,"But in a hut among the throngs of men,"
2652,I,Concealed by meekness and simplicity.
2653,I,"And ever as he walked the city streets,"
2654,I,"Or sat in quietude beside the sea,"
2655,I,"Or trod the hillsides and the harvest fields,"
2656,I,The multitude passed by and knew him not.
2657,I,"But there were some who knew, and turned to him"
2658,I,"For help; and unto all who asked, he gave."
2659,I,"Thus Vera came, and found him in the field,"
2660,I,And knew him by the pity in his face.
2661,I,"She knelt to him and held him by one hand,"
2662,I,And laid the other hand upon her lips
2663,I,In mute entreaty. Then she lifted up
2664,I,"The coils of hair that hung about her neck,"
2665,I,"And bared the beauty of the gates of sound,--"
2666,I,"Those virgin gates through which no voice had passed,--"
2667,I,"She made them bare before the Master's sight,"
2668,I,And looked into the kindness of his face
2669,I,"With eyes that spoke of all her prisoned pain,"
2670,I,And told her great desire without a word.
2671,I,
2672,I,"The Master waited long in silent thought,"
2673,I,"As one reluctant to bestow a gift,"
2674,I,Not for the sake of holding back the thing
2675,I,"Entreated, but because he surely knew"
2676,I,Of something better that he fain would give
2677,I,If only she would ask it. Then he stooped
2678,I,"To Vera, smiling, touched her ears and spoke:"
2679,I,"""Open, fair gates, and you, reluctant doors,"
2680,I,"Within the ivory labyrinth of the ear,"
2681,I,Let fall the bar of silence and unfold!
2682,I,"Enter, you voices of all living things,"
2683,I,"Enter the garden sealed,--but softly, slowly,"
2684,I,"Not with a noise confused and broken tumult,--"
2685,I,"Come in an order sweet as I command you,"
2686,I,"And bring the double gift of speech and hearing."""
2687,I,
2688,I,Vera began to hear. At first the wind
2689,I,"Breathed a low prelude of the birth of sound,"
2690,I,As if an organ far away were touched
2691,I,By unseen fingers; then the little stream
2692,I,"That hurried down the hillside, swept the harp"
2693,I,"Of music into merry, tinkling notes;"
2694,I,And then the lark that poised above her head
2695,I,"On wings a-quiver, overflowed the air"
2696,I,With showers of song; and one by one the tones
2697,I,"Of all things living, in an order sweet,"
2698,I,"Without confusion and with deepening power,"
2699,I,Entered the garden sealed. And last of all
2700,I,"The Master's voice, the human voice divine,"
2701,I,"Passed through the gates and called her by her name,"
2702,I,And Vera heard.
2703,I,
2704,I,
2705,II,II
2706,II,
2707,II,What rapture of new life
2708,II,Must come to one for whom a silent world
2709,II,"Is suddenly made vocal, and whose heart"
2710,II,"By the same magic is awaked at once,"
2711,II,"Without the learner's toil and long delay,"
2712,II,"Out of a night of dumbly moving dreams,"
2713,II,Into a day that overflows with music!
2714,II,This joy was Vera's; and to her it seemed
2715,II,As if a new creative morn had risen
2716,II,"Upon the earth, and after the full week"
2717,II,"When living things unfolded silently,"
2718,II,"And after the long, quiet Sabbath day,"
2719,II,"When all was still, another day had dawned,"
2720,II,And through the calm expectancy of heaven
2721,II,"A secret voice had said, ""Let all things speak."""
2722,II,The world responded with an instant joy;
2723,II,And all the unseen avenues of sound
2724,II,Were thronged with varying forms of viewless life.
2725,II,
2726,II,To every living thing a voice was given
2727,II,Distinct and personal. The forest trees
2728,II,Were not more varied in their shades of green
2729,II,Than in their tones of speech; and every bird
2730,II,That nested in their branches had a song
2731,II,Unknown to other birds and all his own.
2732,II,The waters spoke a hundred dialects
2733,II,Of one great language; now with pattering fall
2734,II,"Of raindrops on the glistening leaves, and now"
2735,II,With steady roar of rivers rushing down
2736,II,"To meet the sea, and now with rhythmic throb"
2737,II,"And measured tumult of tempestuous waves,"
2738,II,"And now with lingering lisp of creeping tides,--"
2739,II,The manifold discourse of many waters.
2740,II,But most of all the human voice was full
2741,II,"Of infinite variety, and ranged"
2742,II,Along the scale of life's experience
2743,II,"With changing tones, and notes both sweet and sad,"
2744,II,"All fitted to express some unseen thought,"
2745,II,Some vital motion of the hidden heart.
2746,II,So Vera listened with her new-born sense
2747,II,"To all the messengers that passed the gates,"
2748,II,"In measureless delight and utter trust,"
2749,II,Believing that they brought a true report
2750,II,"From every living thing of its true life,"
2751,II,And hoping that at last they would make clear
2752,II,The mystery and the meaning of the world.
2753,II,
2754,II,"But soon there came a trouble in her joy,"
2755,II,A note discordant that dissolved the chord
2756,II,And broke the bliss of hearing into pain.
2757,II,Not from the harsher sounds and voices wild
2758,II,"Of anger and of anguish, that reveal"
2759,II,"The secret strife in nature, and confess"
2760,II,"The touch of sorrow on the heart of life,--"
2761,II,"From these her trouble came not. For in these,"
2762,II,"However sad, she felt the note of truth,"
2763,II,"And truth, though sad, is always musical."
2764,II,"The raging of the tempest-ridden sea,"
2765,II,"The crash of thunder, and the hollow moan"
2766,II,"Of winds complaining round the mountain-crags,"
2767,II,"The shrill and quavering cry of birds of prey,"
2768,II,"The fiercer roar of conflict-loving beasts,--"
2769,II,All these wild sounds are potent in their place
2770,II,Within life's mighty symphony; the charm
2771,II,"Of truth attunes them, and the hearing ear"
2772,II,Finds pleasure in their rude sincerity.
2773,II,Even the broken and tumultuous noise
2774,II,"That rises from great cities, where the heart"
2775,II,Of human toil is beating heavily
2776,II,"With ceaseless murmurs of the labouring pulse,"
2777,II,Is not a discord; for it speaks to life
2778,II,"Of life unfeigned, and full of hopes and fears,"
2779,II,And touched through all the trouble of its notes
2780,II,With something real and therefore glorious.
2781,II,
2782,II,"One voice alone of all that sound on earth,"
2783,II,"Is hateful to the soul, and full of pain,--"
2784,II,The voice of falsehood. So when Vera heard
2785,II,"This mocking voice, and knew that it was false;"
2786,II,When first she learned that human lips can speak
2787,II,"The thing that is not, and betray the ear"
2788,II,Of simple trust with treachery of words;
2789,II,The joy of hearing withered in her heart.
2790,II,For now she felt that faithless messengers
2791,II,Could pass the open and unguarded gates
2792,II,"Of sound, and bring a message all untrue,"
2793,II,"Or half a truth that makes the deadliest lie,"
2794,II,"Or idle babble, neither false nor true,"
2795,II,"But hollow to the heart, and meaningless."
2796,II,"She heard the flattering voices of deceit,"
2797,II,That mask the hidden purposes of men
2798,II,"With fair attire of favourable words,"
2799,II,And hide the evil in the guise of good:
2800,II,"The voices vain and decorous and smooth,"
2801,II,That fill the world with empty-hearted talk;
2802,II,"The foolish voices, wandering and confused,"
2803,II,"That never clearly speak the thing they would,"
2804,II,But ramble blindly round their true intent
2805,II,"And tangle sense in hopeless coils of sound,--"
2806,II,"All these she heard, and with a deep mistrust"
2807,II,Began to doubt the value of her gift.
2808,II,"It seemed as if the world, the living world,"
2809,II,"Sincere, and vast, and real, were still concealed,"
2810,II,"And she, within the prison of her soul,"
2811,II,Still waiting silently to hear the voice
2812,II,Of perfect knowledge and of perfect peace.
2813,II,
2814,II,So with the burden of her discontent
2815,II,"She turned to seek the Master once again,"
2816,II,"And found him sitting in the market-place,"
2817,II,"Half-hidden in the shadow of a porch,"
2818,II,Alone among the careless crowd.
2819,II,She spoke:
2820,II,"""Thy gift was great, dear Master, and my heart"
2821,II,Has thanked thee many times because I hear
2822,II,But I have learned that hearing is not all;
2823,II,"For underneath the speech of men, there flows"
2824,II,Another current of their hidden thoughts;
2825,II,Behind the mask of language I perceive
2826,II,The eyes of things unsaid.
2827,II,"Touch me again,"
2828,II,"O Master, with thy liberating hand,"
2829,II,And free me from the bondage of deceit.
2830,II,"Open another gate, and let me hear"
2831,II,The secret thoughts and purposes of men;
2832,II,"For only thus my heart will be at rest,"
2833,II,"And only thus, at last, I shall perceive"
2834,II,"The mystery and the meaning of the world."""
2835,II,
2836,II,The Master's face was turned aside from her;
2837,II,"His eyes looked far away, as if he saw"
2838,II,Something beyond her sight; and yet she knew
2839,II,That he was listening; for her pleading voice
2840,II,No sooner ceased than he put forth his hand
2841,II,"To touch her brow, and very gently spoke:"
2842,II,"""Thou seekest for thyself a wondrous gift,--"
2843,II,"The opening of the second gate, a gift"
2844,II,That many wise men have desired in vain:
2845,II,"But some have found it,--whether well or ill"
2846,II,"For their own peace, they have attained the power"
2847,II,To hear unspoken thoughts of other men.
2848,II,"And thou hast begged this gift? Thou shalt receive,--"
2849,II,"Not knowing what thou seekest,--it is thine:"
2850,II,The second gate is open! Thou shalt hear
2851,II,All that men think and feel within their hearts:
2852,II,"Thy prayer is granted, daughter, go thy way!"
2853,II,"But if thou findest sorrow on this path,"
2854,II,"Come back again,--there is a path to peace."""
2855,II,
2856,II,
2857,III,III
2858,III,
2859,III,"Beyond our power of vision, poets say,"
2860,III,"There is another world of forms unseen,"
2861,III,Yet visible to purer eyes than ours.
2862,III,"And if the crystal of our sight were clear,"
2863,III,"We should behold the mountain-slopes of cloud,"
2864,III,"The moving meadows of the untilled sea,"
2865,III,"The groves of twilight and the dales of dawn,"
2866,III,"And every wide and lonely field of air,"
2867,III,"More populous than cities, crowded close"
2868,III,With living creatures of all shapes and hues.
2869,III,"But if that sight were ours, the things that now"
2870,III,Engage our eyes would seem but dull and dim
2871,III,"Beside the wonders of our new-found world,"
2872,III,And we should be amazed and overwhelmed
2873,III,Not knowing how to use the plenitude
2874,III,Of vision.
2875,III,"So in Vera's soul, at first,"
2876,III,The opening of the second gate of sound
2877,III,Let in confusion like a whirling flood.
2878,III,The murmur of a myriad-throated mob;
2879,III,The trampling of an army through a place
2880,III,"Where echoes hide; the sudden, whistling flight"
2881,III,Of an innumerable flock of birds
2882,III,Along the highway of the midnight sky;
2883,III,The many-whispered rustling of the reeds
2884,III,Beneath the passing feet of all the winds;
2885,III,"The long-drawn, inarticulate, wailing cry"
2886,III,Of million-pebbled beaches when the lash
2887,III,"Of stormy waves is drawn across their back,--"
2888,III,All these were less bewildering than to hear
2889,III,What now she heard at once: the tangled sound
2890,III,Of all that moves within the minds of men.
2891,III,For now there was no measured flow of words
2892,III,To mark the time; nor any interval
2893,III,Of silence to repose the listening ear.
2894,III,"But through the dead of night, and through the calm"
2895,III,"Of weary noon-tide, through the solemn hush"
2896,III,"That fills the temple in the pause of praise,"
2897,III,"And through the breathless awe in rooms of death,"
2898,III,She heard the ceaseless motion and the stir
2899,III,"Of never-silent hearts, that fill the world"
2900,III,"With interwoven thoughts of good and ill,"
2901,III,"With mingled music of delight and grief,"
2902,III,"With songs of love, and bitter cries of hate,"
2903,III,"With hymns of faith, and dirges of despair,"
2904,III,"And murmurs deeper and more vague than all,--"
2905,III,"Thoughts that are born and die without a name,"
2906,III,"Or rather, never die, but haunt the soul,"
2907,III,"With sad persistence, till a name is given."
2908,III,"These Vera heard, at first with mind perplexed"
2909,III,And half-benumbed by the disordered sound.
2910,III,But soon a clearer sense began to pierce
2911,III,The cloudy turmoil with discerning power.
2912,III,She learned to know the tones of human thought
2913,III,As plainly as she knew the tones of speech.
2914,III,"She could divide the evil from the good,"
2915,III,"Interpreting the language of the mind,"
2916,III,And tracing every feeling like a thread
2917,III,Within the mystic web the passions weave
2918,III,From heart to heart around the living world.
2919,III,
2920,III,But when at last the Master's second gift
2921,III,"Was perfected within her, and she heard"
2922,III,"And understood the secret thoughts of men,"
2923,III,"A sadness fell upon her, and the load"
2924,III,Of insupportable knowledge pressed her down
2925,III,"With weary wishes to know more, or less."
2926,III,For all she knew was like a broken word
2927,III,Inscribed upon the fragment of a ring;
2928,III,And all she heard was like a broken strain
2929,III,Preluding music that is never played.
2930,III,
2931,III,Then she remembered in her sad unrest
2932,III,"The Master's parting word,--""a path to peace,""--"
2933,III,And turned again to seek him with her grief.
2934,III,"She found him in a hollow of the hills,"
2935,III,Beside a little spring that issued forth
2936,III,Beneath the rocks and filled a mossy cup
2937,III,"With never-failing water. There he sat,"
2938,III,With waiting looks that welcomed her afar.
2939,III,"""I know that thou hast heard, my child,"" he said,"
2940,III,"""For all the wonder of the world of sound"
2941,III,"Is written in thy face. But hast thou heard,"
2942,III,"Among the many voices, one of peace?"
2943,III,"And is thy heart that hears the secret thoughts,"
2944,III,"The hidden wishes and desires of men,"
2945,III,"Content with hearing? Art thou satisfied?"""
2946,III,"""Nay, Master,"" she replied, ""thou knowest well"
2947,III,"That I am not at rest, nor have I heard"
2948,III,The voice of perfect peace; but what I hear
2949,III,Brings me disquiet and a troubled mind.
2950,III,"The evil voices in the souls of men,"
2951,III,Voices of rage and cruelty and fear
2952,III,Have not dismayed me; for I have believed
2953,III,"The voices of the good, the kind, the true,"
2954,III,Are more in number and excel in strength.
2955,III,"There is more love than hate, more hope than fear,"
2956,III,In the deep throbbing of the human heart.
2957,III,"But while I listen to the troubled sound,"
2958,III,"One thing torments me, and destroys my rest"
2959,III,"And presses me with dull, unceasing pain."
2960,III,"For out of all the minds of all mankind,"
2961,III,There rises evermore a questioning voice
2962,III,That asks the meaning of this mighty world
2963,III,"And finds no answer,--asks, and asks again,"
2964,III,"With patient pleading or with wild complaint,"
2965,III,"But wakens no response, except the sound"
2966,III,"Of other questions, wandering to and fro,"
2967,III,From other souls in doubt. And so this voice
2968,III,"Persists above all others that I hear,"
2969,III,"And binds them up together into one,"
2970,III,Until the mingled murmur of the world
2971,III,Sounds through the inner temple of my heart
2972,III,"Like an eternal question, vainly asked"
2973,III,By every human soul that thinks and feels.
2974,III,"This is the heaviness that weighs me down,"
2975,III,And this the pain that will not let me rest.
2976,III,"Therefore, dear Master, shut the gates again,"
2977,III,And let me live in silence as before!
2978,III,"Or else,--and if there is indeed a gate"
2979,III,"Unopened yet, through which I might receive"
2980,III,"An answer in the voice of perfect peace--"""
2981,III,
2982,III,She ceased; and in her upward faltering tone
2983,III,The question echoed.
2984,III,Then the Master said:
2985,III,"""There is another gate, not yet unclosed."
2986,III,For through the outer portal of the ear
2987,III,Only the outer voice of things may pass;
2988,III,And through the middle doorway of the mind
2989,III,"Only the half-formed voice of human thoughts,"
2990,III,Uncertain and perplexed with endless doubt;
2991,III,But through the inmost gate the spirit hears
2992,III,The voice of that great Spirit who is Life.
2993,III,Beneath the tones of living things He breathes
2994,III,A deeper tone than ever ear hath heard;
2995,III,And underneath the troubled thoughts of men
2996,III,"He thinks forever, and His thought is peace."
2997,III,"Behold, I touch thee once again, my child:"
2998,III,The third and last of those three hidden gates
2999,III,"That closed around thy soul and shut thee in,"
3000,III,"Is open now, and thou shalt truly hear."""
3001,III,
3002,III,Then Vera heard. The spiritual gate
3003,III,Was opened softly as a full-blown flower
3004,III,"Unfolds its heart to welcome in the dawn,"
3005,III,And on her listening face there shone a light
3006,III,Of still amazement and completed joy
3007,III,In the full gift of hearing.
3008,III,What she heard
3009,III,I cannot tell; nor could she ever tell
3010,III,In words; because all human words are vain.
3011,III,"There is no speech nor language, to express"
3012,III,"The secret messages of God, that make"
3013,III,Perpetual music in the hearing heart.
3014,III,"Below the voice of waters, and above"
3015,III,"The wandering voice of winds, and underneath"
3016,III,"The song of birds, and all the varying tones"
3017,III,"Of living things that fill the world with sound,"
3018,III,"God spoke to her, and what she heard was peace."
3019,III,
3020,III,"So when the Master questioned, ""Dost thou hear?"""
3021,III,"She answered, ""Yea, at last I hear."" And then"
3022,III,"He asked her once again, ""What hearest thou?"
3023,III,"What means the voice of Life?"" She answered, ""Love!"
3024,III,"For love is life, and they who do not love"
3025,III,"Are not alive. But every soul that loves,"
3026,III,"Lives in the heart of God and hears Him speak."""

3050,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"You rob the world, you waste a soul; give me a little time."
3051,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3052,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"You'll hear me? Yes, I'm sure you will, my hope is not in vain:"
3053,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"I feel the even pulse of peace, the sweet relief from pain;"
3054,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,The black fog rolls away from me; I'm free once more to plan:
3055,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,Another chance is all I need to prove myself a man!

3058,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3059,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,The world is full of warfare 'twixt the evil and the good;
3060,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,I watched the battle from afar as one who understood
3061,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"The shouting and confusion, the bloody, blundering fight--"
3062,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"How few there are that see it clear, how few that wage it right!"
3063,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3064,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"The captains flushed with foolish pride, the soldiers pale with fear,"
3065,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"The faltering flags, the feeble fire from ranks that swerve and veer,"
3066,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"The wild mistakes, the dismal doubts, the coward hearts that flee--"
3067,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,The good cause needs a nobler knight to win the victory.
3068,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3069,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"A man whose soul is pure and strong, whose sword is bright and keen,"
3070,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,Who knows the splendour of the fight and what its issues mean;
3071,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"Who never takes one step aside, nor halts, though hope be dim,"
3072,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"But cleaves a pathway thro' the strife, and bids men follow him."
3073,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3074,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"No blot upon his stainless shield, no weakness in his arm;"
3075,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,No sign of trembling in his face to break his valour's charm:
3076,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,A man like this could stay the flight and lead the wavering line;
3077,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"Ah, give me but a year of life--I'll make that glory mine!"
3078,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,

3080,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3081,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"Religion? Yes, I know it well; I've heard its prayers and creeds,"
3082,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"And seen men put them all to shame with poor, half-hearted deeds."
3083,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"They follow Christ, but far away; they wander and they doubt."
3084,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"I'll serve him in a better way, and live his precepts out."
3085,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3086,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"You see, I waited just for this; I could not be content"
3087,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"To own a feeble, faltering faith with human weakness blent."
3088,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"Too many runners in the race move slowly, stumble, fall;"
3089,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,But I will run so straight and swift I shall outstrip them all.
3090,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3091,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"Oh, think what it will mean to men, amid their foolish strife,"
3092,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"To see the clear, unshadowed light of one true Christian life,"
3093,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"Without a touch of selfishness, without a taint of sin,--"
3094,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,With one short month of such a life a new world would begin!

3097,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3098,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,And love!--I often dream of that--the treasure of the earth;
3099,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,How little they who use the coin have realised its worth!
3100,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"'Twill pay all debts, enrich all hearts, and make all joys secure."
3101,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"But love, to do its perfect work, must be sincere and pure."
3102,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3103,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,My heart is full of virgin gold. I'll pour it out and spend
3104,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,My hidden wealth with open hand on all who call me friend.
3105,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"Not one shall miss the kindly deed, the largess of relief,"
3106,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"The generous fellowship of joy, the sympathy of grief."
3107,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3108,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"I'll say the loyal, helpful things that make life sweet and fair,"
3109,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,I'll pay the gratitude I owe for human love and care.
3110,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"Perhaps I've been at fault sometimes--I'll ask to be forgiven,"
3111,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,And make this little room of mine seem like a bit of heaven.
3112,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,
3113,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,For one by one I'll call my friends to stand beside my bed;
3114,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,I'll speak the true and tender words so often left unsaid;
3115,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"And every heart shall throb and glow, all coldness melt away"
3116,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"Around my altar-fire of love--ah, give me but one day!"

3121,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,"A priceless day in empty dreams, another chance in vain?"
3122,A DRAMATIC LYRIC,Thou fool--this night--it's very dark--the last--this choking breath--

3130,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,It pleased the Lord of Angels (praise His name!)
3131,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"To hear, one day, report from those who came"
3132,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"With pitying sorrow, or exultant joy,"
3133,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,To tell of earthly tasks in His employ.
3134,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,For some were grieved because they saw how slow
3135,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,The stream of heavenly love on earth must flow;
3136,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And some were glad because their eyes had seen,"
3137,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Along its banks, fresh flowers and living green."
3138,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"At last, before the whiteness of the throne"
3139,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The youngest angel, Asmiel, stood alone;"
3140,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Nor glad, nor sad, but full of earnest thought,"
3141,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And thus his tidings to the Master brought
3142,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Lord, in the city Lupon I have found"
3143,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Three servants of thy holy name, renowned"
3144,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Above their fellows. One is very wise,"
3145,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,With thoughts that ever range beyond the skies;
3146,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And one is gifted with the golden speech
3147,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,That makes men gladly hear when he will teach;
3148,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And one, with no rare gift or grace endued,"
3149,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Has won the people's love by doing good.
3150,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,With three such saints Lupon is trebly blest;
3151,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"But, Lord, I fain would know, which loves Thee best?"""
3152,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Then spake the Lord of Angels, to whose look"
3153,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,The hearts of all are like an open book:
3154,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""In every soul the secret thought I read,"
3155,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And well I know who loves me best indeed.
3156,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"But every life has pages vacant still,"
3157,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Whereon a man may write the thing he will;
3158,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Therefore I read the record, day by day,"
3159,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And wait for hearts untaught to learn my way.
3160,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"But thou shalt go to Lupon, to the three"
3161,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Who serve me there, and take this word from me:"
3162,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Tell each of them his Master bids him go
3163,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow;"
3164,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,There he shall find a certain task for me:
3165,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"But what, I do not tell to them nor thee."
3166,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Give thou the message, make my word the test,"
3167,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And crown for me the one who loves me best."""
3168,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Silent the angel stood, with folded hands,"
3169,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,To take the imprint of his Lord's commands;
3170,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Then drew one breath, obedient and elate,"
3171,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And passed the self-same hour, through Lupon's gate."
3172,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,

3174,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,
3175,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,First to the Temple door he made his way;
3176,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And there, because it was a holy-day,"
3177,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"He saw the folk in thousands thronging, stirred"
3178,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,By ardent thirst to hear the preacher's word.
3179,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Then, while the people whispered Bernol's name,"
3180,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Through aisles that hushed behind him Bernol came;
3181,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Strung to the keenest pitch of conscious might,"
3182,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"With lips prepared and firm, and eyes alight."
3183,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,One moment at the pulpit step he knelt
3184,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"In silent prayer, and on his shoulder felt"
3185,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The angel's hand:--""The Master bids thee go"
3186,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,"
3187,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"To serve Him there."" Then Bernol's hidden face"
3188,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Went white as death, and for about the space"
3189,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Of ten slow heart-beats there was no reply;
3190,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Till Bernol looked around and whispered, ""_Why?_"""
3191,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,But answer to his question came there none;
3192,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The angel sighed, and with a sigh was gone."

3195,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,
3196,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Within the humble house where Malvin spent
3197,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"His studious years, on holy things intent,"
3198,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Sweet stillness reigned; and there the angel found
3199,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The saintly sage immersed in thought profound,"
3200,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Weaving with patient toil and willing care
3201,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"A web of wisdom, wonderful and fair:"
3202,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"A seamless robe for Truth's great bridal meet,"
3203,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And needing but one thread to be complete.
3204,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Then Asmiel touched his hand, and broke the thread"
3205,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Of fine-spun thought, and very gently said,"
3206,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""The One of whom thou thinkest bids thee go"
3207,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,"
3208,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"To serve Him there."" With sorrow and surprise"
3209,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Malvin looked up, reluctance in his eyes."
3210,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The broken thought, the strangeness of the call,"
3211,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The perilous passage of the mountain-wall,"
3212,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The solitary journey, and the length"
3213,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Of ways unknown, too great for his frail strength,"
3214,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Appalled him. With a doubtful brow
3215,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"He scanned the doubtful task, and muttered ""_How?_"""
3216,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"But Asmiel answered, as he turned to go,"
3217,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"With cold, disheartened voice, ""I do not know."""
3218,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,

3220,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,

3222,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The third and last to whom God bade him speak,"
3223,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Scarce twenty steps away whom should he meet
3224,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"But Fermor, hurrying cheerful down the street,"
3225,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"With ready heart that faced his work like play,"
3226,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And joyed to find it greater every day!
3227,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The angel stopped him with uplifted hand,"
3228,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And gave without delay his Lord's command:
3229,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""He whom thou servest here would have thee go"
3230,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,"
3231,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"To serve Him there."" Ere Asmiel breathed again"
3232,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The eager answer leaped to meet him, ""_When?_"""
3233,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,
3234,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The angel's face with inward joy grew bright,"
3235,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And all his figure glowed with heavenly light;
3236,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,He took the golden circlet from his brow
3237,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And gave the crown to Fermor, answering, ""Now!"
3238,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"For thou hast met the Master's hidden test,"
3239,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And I have found the man who loves Him best.
3240,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Not thine, nor mine, to question or reply"
3241,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"When He commands us, asking 'how?' or 'why?'"
3242,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,He knows the cause; His ways are wise and just;
3243,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Who serves the King must serve with perfect trust."""

3459,I,"The other night I had a dream, most clear"
3460,I,"And comforting, complete"
3461,I,"In every line, a crystal sphere,"
3462,I,And full of intimate and secret cheer.
3463,I,Therefore I will repeat
3464,I,"That vision, dearest heart, to you,"
3465,I,"As of a thing not feigned, but very true,"
3466,I,"Yes, true as ever in my life befell;"
3467,I,"And you, perhaps, can tell"
3468,I,Whether my dream was really sad or sweet.
3469,I,
3470,I,
3471,II,II
3472,II,
3473,II,The shadows flecked the elm-embowered street
3474,II,"I knew so well, long, long ago;"
3475,II,And on the pillared porch where Marguerite
3476,II,"Had sat with me, the moonlight lay like snow."
3477,II,"But she, my comrade and my friend of youth,"
3478,II,"Most gaily wise,"
3479,II,"Most innocently loved,--"
3480,II,She of the blue-gray eyes
3481,II,"That ever smiled and ever spoke the truth,--"
3482,II,"From that familiar dwelling, where she moved"
3483,II,"Like mirth incarnate in the years before,"
3484,II,Had gone into the hidden house of Death.
3485,II,I thought the garden wore
3486,II,"White mourning for her blessed innocence,"
3487,II,And the syringa's breath
3488,II,Came from the corner by the fence
3489,II,"Where she had made her rustic seat,"
3490,II,"With fragrance passionate, intense,"
3491,II,As if it breathed a sigh for Marguerite.
3492,II,My heart was heavy with a sense
3493,II,Of something good for ever gone. I sought
3494,II,"Vainly for some consoling thought,"
3495,II,Some comfortable word that I could say
3496,II,"To her sad father, whom I visited again"
3497,II,For the first time since she had gone away.
3498,II,"The bell rang shrill and lonely,--then"
3499,II,"The door was opened, and I sent my name"
3500,II,"To him,--but ah! 'twas Marguerite who came!"
3501,II,There in the dear old dusky room she stood
3502,II,"Beneath the lamp, just as she used to stand,"
3503,II,In tender mocking mood.
3504,II,"""You did not ask for me,"" she said,"
3505,II,"""And so I will not let you take my hand;"
3506,II,But I must hear what secret talk you planned
3507,II,"With father. Come, my friend, be good,"
3508,II,And tell me your affairs of state:
3509,II,Why you have stayed away and made me wait
3510,II,"So long. Sit down beside me here,--"
3511,II,"And, do you know, it seems a year"
3512,II,"Since we have talked together,--why so late?"""
3513,II,"Amazed, incredulous, confused with joy"
3514,II,"I hardly dared to show,"
3515,II,"And stammering like a boy,"
3516,II,I took the place she showed me at her side;
3517,II,And then the talk flowed on with brimming tide
3518,II,"Through the still night,"
3519,II,While she with influence light
3520,II,"Controlled it, as the moon the flood."
3521,II,"She knew where I had been, what I had done,"
3522,II,"What work was planned, and what begun;"
3523,II,"My troubles, failures, fears she understood,"
3524,II,"And touched them with a heart so kind,"
3525,II,"That every care was melted from my mind,"
3526,II,"And every hope grew bright,"
3527,II,And life seemed moving on to happy ends.
3528,II,"(Ah, what self-beggared fool was he"
3529,II,That said a woman cannot be
3530,II,The very best of friends?)
3531,II,"Then there were memories of old times,"
3532,II,Recalled with many a gentle jest;
3533,II,And at the last she brought the book of rhymes
3534,II,"We made together, trying to translate"
3535,II,The Songs of Heine (hers were always best).
3536,II,"""Now come,"" she said,"
3537,II,"""To-night we will collaborate"
3538,II,Again; I'll put you to the test.
3539,II,"Here's one I never found the way to do,--"
3540,II,"The simplest are the hardest ones, you know,--"
3541,II,"I give this song to you."""
3542,II,And then she read:
3543,II,"_Mein Kind, wir waren Kinder,"
3544,II,"Zwei Kinder, jung und froh._"
3545,II,
3546,II,*       *       *       *       *
3547,II,
3548,II,"But all the while, a silent question stirred"
3549,II,"Within me, though I dared not speak the word:"
3550,II,"""Is it herself, and is she truly here,"
3551,II,And was I dreaming when I heard
3552,II,That she was dead last year?
3553,II,"Or was it true, and is she but a shade"
3554,II,"Who brings a fleeting joy to eye and ear,"
3555,II,"Cold though so kind, and will she gently fade"
3556,II,When her sweet ghostly part is played
3557,II,"And the light-curtain falls at dawn of day?"""
3558,II,
3559,II,But while my heart was troubled by this fear
3560,II,"So deeply that I could not speak it out,"
3561,II,"Lest all my happiness should disappear,"
3562,II,I thought me of a cunning way
3563,II,To hide the question and dissolve the doubt.
3564,II,"""Will you not give me now your hand,"
3565,II,"Dear Marguerite,"" I asked, ""to touch and hold,"
3566,II,That by this token I may understand
3567,II,"You are the same true friend you were of old?"""
3568,II,She answered with a smile so bright and calm
3569,II,It seemed as if I saw the morn arise
3570,II,In the deep heaven of her eyes;
3571,II,"And smiling so, she laid her palm"
3572,II,"In mine. Dear God, it was not cold"
3573,II,But warm with vital heat!
3574,II,"""You live!"" I cried, ""you live, dear Marguerite!"""
3575,II,"When I awoke; but strangely comforted,"
3576,II,Although I knew again that she was dead.
3577,II,
3578,II,
3579,III,III
3580,III,
3581,III,"Yes, there's the dream! And was it sweet or sad?"
3582,III,"Dear mistress of my waking and my sleep,"
3583,III,"Present reward of all my heart's desire,"
3584,III,"Watching with me beside the winter fire,"
3585,III,Interpret now this vision that I had.
3586,III,"But while you read the meaning, let me keep"
3587,III,The touch of you: for the Old Year with storm
3588,III,"Is passing through the midnight, and doth shake"
3589,III,"The corners of the house,--and oh! my heart would break"
3590,III,Unless both dreaming and awake
3591,III,"My hand could feel your hand was warm, warm, warm!"

3598,THE VAIN KING,
3599,THE VAIN KING,
3600,THE VAIN KING,"In robes of Tyrian blue the King was drest,"
3601,THE VAIN KING,"A jewelled collar shone upon his breast,"
3602,THE VAIN KING,A giant ruby glittered in his crown:
3603,THE VAIN KING,"Lord of rich lands and many a splendid town,"
3604,THE VAIN KING,In him the glories of an ancient line
3605,THE VAIN KING,"Of sober kings, who ruled by right divine,"
3606,THE VAIN KING,Were centred; and to him with loyal awe
3607,THE VAIN KING,The people looked for leadership and law.
3608,THE VAIN KING,"Ten thousand knights, the safeguard of the land,"
3609,THE VAIN KING,Were like a single sword within his hand;
3610,THE VAIN KING,"A hundred courts, with power of life and death,"
3611,THE VAIN KING,Proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath;
3612,THE VAIN KING,And all the sacred growths that men had known
3613,THE VAIN KING,Of order and of rule upheld his throne.
3614,THE VAIN KING,
3615,THE VAIN KING,Proud was the King: yet not with such a heart
3616,THE VAIN KING,As fits a man to play a royal part.
3617,THE VAIN KING,Not his the pride that honours as a trust
3618,THE VAIN KING,"The right to rule, the duty to be just:"
3619,THE VAIN KING,Not his the dignity that bends to bear
3620,THE VAIN KING,"The monarch's yoke, the master's load of care,"
3621,THE VAIN KING,"And labours like the peasant at his gate,"
3622,THE VAIN KING,To serve the people and protect the State.
3623,THE VAIN KING,"Another pride was his, and other joys:"
3624,THE VAIN KING,"To him the crown and sceptre were but toys,"
3625,THE VAIN KING,"With which he played at glory's idle game,"
3626,THE VAIN KING,To please himself and win the wreaths of fame.
3627,THE VAIN KING,"The throne his fathers held from age to age,"
3628,THE VAIN KING,To his ambition seemed a fitting stage
3629,THE VAIN KING,"Built for King Martin to display at will,"
3630,THE VAIN KING,His mighty strength and universal skill.
3631,THE VAIN KING,"No conscious child, that, spoiled with praising, tries"
3632,THE VAIN KING,"At every step to win admiring eyes,"
3633,THE VAIN KING,"No favourite mountebank, whose acting draws"
3634,THE VAIN KING,"From gaping crowds the thunder of applause,"
3635,THE VAIN KING,Was vainer than the King: his only thirst
3636,THE VAIN KING,"Was to be hailed, in every race, the first."
3637,THE VAIN KING,"When tournament was held, in knightly guise"
3638,THE VAIN KING,The King would ride the lists and win the prize;
3639,THE VAIN KING,"When music charmed the court, with golden lyre"
3640,THE VAIN KING,The King would take the stage and lead the choir;
3641,THE VAIN KING,"In hunting, his the lance to slay the boar;"
3642,THE VAIN KING,"In hawking, see his falcon highest soar;"
3643,THE VAIN KING,"In painting, he would wield the master's brush;"
3644,THE VAIN KING,"In high debate,--""the King is speaking! Hush!"""
3645,THE VAIN KING,"Thus, with a restless heart, in every field"
3646,THE VAIN KING,"He sought renown, and made his subjects yield."
3647,THE VAIN KING,But while he played the petty games of life
3648,THE VAIN KING,His kingdom fell a prey to inward strife;
3649,THE VAIN KING,"Corruption through the court unheeded crept,"
3650,THE VAIN KING,And on the seat of honour justice slept.
3651,THE VAIN KING,The strong trod down the weak; the helpless poor
3652,THE VAIN KING,Groaned under burdens grievous to endure;
3653,THE VAIN KING,"The nation's wealth was spent in vain display,"
3654,THE VAIN KING,And weakness wore the nation's heart away.
3655,THE VAIN KING,
3656,THE VAIN KING,Yet think not Earth is blind to human woes--
3657,THE VAIN KING,Man has more friends and helpers than he knows;
3658,THE VAIN KING,"And when a patient people are oppressed,"
3659,THE VAIN KING,The land that bore them feels it in her breast.
3660,THE VAIN KING,"Spirits of field and flood, of heath and hill,"
3661,THE VAIN KING,Are grieved and angry at the spreading ill;
3662,THE VAIN KING,"The trees complain together in the night,"
3663,THE VAIN KING,"Voices of wrath are heard along the height,"
3664,THE VAIN KING,"And secret vows are sworn, by stream and strand,"
3665,THE VAIN KING,To bring the tyrant low and free the land.
3666,THE VAIN KING,
3667,THE VAIN KING,But little recked the pampered King of these;
3668,THE VAIN KING,He heard no voice but such as praise and please.
3669,THE VAIN KING,"Flattered and fooled, victor in every sport,"
3670,THE VAIN KING,One day he wandered idly with his court
3671,THE VAIN KING,"Beside the river, seeking to devise"
3672,THE VAIN KING,New ways to show his skill to wondering eyes.
3673,THE VAIN KING,"There in the stream a patient angler stood,"
3674,THE VAIN KING,And cast his line across the rippling flood.
3675,THE VAIN KING,His silver spoil lay near him on the green:
3676,THE VAIN KING,"""Such fish,"" the courtiers cried, ""were never seen!"
3677,THE VAIN KING,Three salmon longer than a cloth-yard shaft--
3678,THE VAIN KING,"This man must be the master of his craft!"""
3679,THE VAIN KING,"""An easy art!"" the jealous King replied:"
3680,THE VAIN KING,"""Myself could learn it better, if I tried,"
3681,THE VAIN KING,And catch a hundred larger fish a week--
3682,THE VAIN KING,"Wilt thou accept the challenge, fellow? Speak!"""
3683,THE VAIN KING,"The angler turned, came near, and bent his knee:"
3684,THE VAIN KING,"""'Tis not for kings to strive with such as me;"
3685,THE VAIN KING,"Yet if the King commands it, I obey."
3686,THE VAIN KING,But one condition of the strife I pray:
3687,THE VAIN KING,The fisherman who brings the least to land
3688,THE VAIN KING,"Shall do whate'er the other may command."""
3689,THE VAIN KING,"Loud laughed the King: ""A foolish fisher thou!"
3690,THE VAIN KING,"For I shall win, and rule thee then as now."""
3691,THE VAIN KING,
3692,THE VAIN KING,"Then to Prince John, a sober soul, sedate"
3693,THE VAIN KING,"And slow, King Martin left the helm of State,"
3694,THE VAIN KING,While to the novel game with eager zest
3695,THE VAIN KING,He all his time and all his powers addressed.
3696,THE VAIN KING,Sure such a sight was never seen before!
3697,THE VAIN KING,In robe and crown the monarch trod the shore;
3698,THE VAIN KING,"His golden hooks were decked with feathers fine,"
3699,THE VAIN KING,His jewelled reel ran out a silken line.
3700,THE VAIN KING,With kingly strokes he flogged the crystal stream;
3701,THE VAIN KING,Far-off the salmon saw his tackle gleam;
3702,THE VAIN KING,"Careless of kings, they eyed with calm disdain"
3703,THE VAIN KING,"The gaudy lure, and Martin fished in vain."
3704,THE VAIN KING,"On Friday, when the week was almost spent,"
3705,THE VAIN KING,"He scanned his empty creel with discontent,"
3706,THE VAIN KING,"Called for a net, and cast it far and wide,"
3707,THE VAIN KING,And drew--a thousand minnows from the tide!
3708,THE VAIN KING,"Then came the angler to conclude the match,"
3709,THE VAIN KING,And at the monarch's feet spread out his catch--
3710,THE VAIN KING,"A hundred salmon, greater than before."
3711,THE VAIN KING,"""I win!"" he cried: ""the King must pay the score."""
3712,THE VAIN KING,"Then Martin, angry, threw his tackle down:"
3713,THE VAIN KING,"""Rather than lose this game I'd lose my crown!"""
3714,THE VAIN KING,"""Nay, thou hast lost them both,"" the angler said;"
3715,THE VAIN KING,And as he spoke a wondrous light was shed
3716,THE VAIN KING,"Around his form; he dropped his garments mean,"
3717,THE VAIN KING,And in his place the River-god was seen.
3718,THE VAIN KING,"""Thy vanity has brought thee in my power,"
3719,THE VAIN KING,And thou must pay the forfeit at this hour:
3720,THE VAIN KING,"For thou hast shown thyself a royal fool,"
3721,THE VAIN KING,"Too proud to angle, and too vain to rule,"
3722,THE VAIN KING,"Eager to win in every trivial strife,--"
3723,THE VAIN KING,"Go! Thou shalt fish for minnows all thy life!"""
3724,THE VAIN KING,"Wrathful, the King the magic sentence heard;"
3725,THE VAIN KING,"He strove to answer, but he only _chirr-r-ed_:"
3726,THE VAIN KING,"His royal robe was changed to wings of blue,"
3727,THE VAIN KING,"His crown a ruby crest,--away he flew!"
3728,THE VAIN KING,
3729,THE VAIN KING,So every summer day along the stream
3730,THE VAIN KING,"The vain King-fisher darts, an azure gleam,"
3731,THE VAIN KING,And scolds the angler with a mocking scream.

3749,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"Contented and happy, as young trees should."
3750,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,His body was straight and his boughs were clean;
3751,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,And summer and winter the bountiful sheen

3757,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,In the wonderful raiment that summer weaves
3758,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,Of manifold shapes and kinds of leaves:
3759,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"He looked at his needles so stiff and small,"
3760,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,And thought that his dress was the poorest of all.
3761,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"Then jealousy clouded the little tree's mind,"
3762,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"And he said to himself, ""It was not very kind"

3770,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,Was made of the brightest beaten gold.
3771,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"I tell you, children, the tree was proud;"
3772,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,He was something above the common crowd;
3773,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"And he tinkled his leaves, as if he would say"

3791,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,The tree was a crystal chandelier;
3792,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"And it seemed, as he stood in the morning light,"
3793,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,That his branches were covered with jewels bright.
3794,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"""Aha!"" said the tree. ""This is something great!"""
3795,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"And he held himself up, very proud and straight;"
3796,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"But a rude young wind through the forest dashed,"
3797,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"In a reckless temper, and quickly smashed"
3798,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,The delicate leaves. With a clashing sound
3799,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"They broke into pieces and fell on the ground,"
3800,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"Like a silvery, shimmering shower of hail,"
3801,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,And the tree stood naked and bare to the gale.
3802,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,
3803,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"Then his heart was sad; and he cried, ""Alas"
3804,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,For my beautiful leaves of shining glass!
3805,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,Perhaps I have made another mistake
3806,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,In choosing a dress so easy to break.
3807,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,If the fairies only would hear me again
3808,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,I'd ask them for something both pretty and plain:
3809,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"It wouldn't cost much to grant my request,--"
3810,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"In leaves of green lettuce I'd like to be dressed!"""
3811,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"By this time the fairies were laughing, I know;"
3812,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,But they gave him his wish in a second; and so
3813,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"With leaves of green lettuce, all tender and sweet,"
3814,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"The tree was arrayed, from his head to his feet."
3815,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"""I knew it!"" he cried, ""I was sure I could find"
3816,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,The sort of a suit that would be to my mind.
3817,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"There's none of the trees has a prettier dress,"
3818,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"And none as attractive as I am, I guess."""
3819,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"But a goat, who was taking an afternoon walk,"
3820,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,By chance overheard the fir-tree's talk.
3821,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,So he came up close for a nearer view;--
3822,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"""My salad!"" he bleated, ""I think so too!"
3823,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"You're the most attractive kind of a tree,"
3824,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"And I want your leaves for my five-o'clock tea."""
3825,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"So he ate them all without saying grace,"
3826,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,And walked away with a grin on his face;
3827,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"While the little tree stood in the twilight dim,"
3828,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,With never a leaf on a single limb.
3829,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,
3830,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,Then he sighed and groaned; but his voice was weak--
3831,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,He was so ashamed that he could not speak.
3832,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"He knew at last he had been a fool,"
3833,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"To think of breaking the forest rule,"
3834,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"And choosing a dress himself to please,"
3835,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,Because he envied the other trees.
3836,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"But it couldn't be helped, it was now too late,"
3837,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,He must make up his mind to a leafless fate!
3838,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"So he let himself sink in a slumber deep,"
3839,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"But he moaned and he tossed in his troubled sleep,"
3840,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"Till the morning touched him with joyful beam,"
3841,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,And he woke to find it was all a dream.
3842,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"For there in his evergreen dress he stood,"
3843,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,A pointed fir in the midst of the wood!
3844,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"His branches were sweet with the balsam smell,"
3845,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,His needles were green when the white snow fell.
3846,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,"And always contented and happy was he,--"
3847,THE FOOLISH FIR-TREE,The very best kind of a Christmas tree.

4552,NEPENTHE,To dull the thirst which you alone could still.
4553,NEPENTHE,
4554,NEPENTHE,"But as I turned, the desert miles were crossed,"

4558,NEPENTHE,And with bright eyes and tender hands outspread
4559,NEPENTHE,Restored me to the Eden I had lost.
4560,NEPENTHE,"Never a word of cold reproof,"
4561,NEPENTHE,"No sharp reproach, no glances that accuse"
4562,NEPENTHE,"The culprit whom they hold aloof,--"

4564,NEPENTHE,The empire they have won!
4565,NEPENTHE,"For there is none like you, beloved,--none"
4566,NEPENTHE,Secure enough to do what you have done.
4567,NEPENTHE,"Where did you learn this heavenly art,--"
4568,NEPENTHE,"You sweetest and most wise of all that live,--"
4569,NEPENTHE,With silent welcome to impart
4570,NEPENTHE,Assurance of the royal heart
4571,NEPENTHE,That never questions where it would forgive?
4572,NEPENTHE,
4573,NEPENTHE,None but a queen could pardon me like this!
4574,NEPENTHE,"My sovereign lady, let me lay"
4575,NEPENTHE,Within each rosy palm a loyal kiss
4576,NEPENTHE,"Of penitence, then close the fingers up,"
4577,NEPENTHE,Thus--thus! Now give the cup
4578,NEPENTHE,"Of full nepenthe in your crimson mouth,"
4579,NEPENTHE,"And come--the garden blooms with bliss,"
4580,NEPENTHE,"The wind is in the south,"

4729,III,"From that accursed, dumb, and ancient wood,"

4733,III,"The numberless, ill-omened brood"

4754,IV,Where was it gone?
4755,IV,"Lost, lost, forevermore!"
4756,IV,"Only a cottage, dull and gray,"
4757,IV,"In the cold light of dawn,"
4758,IV,With iron bars across the door:
4759,IV,Only a garden where the drooping head
4760,IV,"Of one sad rose, foreboding its decay,"
4761,IV,Hung o'er a barren bed:
4762,IV,Only a desolate field that lay
4763,IV,"Untilled beneath the desolate day,--"
4764,IV,Where Eden seemed to bloom I found but these!
4765,IV,"So, wondering, I passed along my way,"

5311,THE RIVER OF DREAMS,"The changing sights and the passing shows,"

5575,SANTA CHRISTINA,Her blessed heart could still impart
5576,SANTA CHRISTINA,"Some portion of its secret grace,"
5577,SANTA CHRISTINA,And charity shone in her face.
5578,SANTA CHRISTINA,
5579,SANTA CHRISTINA,In joy she grew from year to year;

5590,SANTA CHRISTINA,As if she lingered near them;
5591,SANTA CHRISTINA,"They cannot reach her with love's speech,"
5592,SANTA CHRISTINA,"But when they say ""Christina"" now"
5593,SANTA CHRISTINA,'Tis like a prayer or like a vow:
5594,SANTA CHRISTINA,
5595,SANTA CHRISTINA,A vow to keep her life alive
5596,SANTA CHRISTINA,"In deeds of pure affection,"
5597,SANTA CHRISTINA,So that her love shall find in them

5599,SANTA CHRISTINA,A constant prayer that they may wear

6013,AUTUMN IN THE GARDEN,"On the flowers, and the misty morning grieves"
6014,AUTUMN IN THE GARDEN,Over fallen leaves;

7035,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,
7036,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"I know not why, but something in my heart"

7041,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"And down the rugged shore of Newfoundland,"
7042,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,And past the rocky capes and wooded bays
7043,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Where Gosnold sailed,--like one who feels his way"
7044,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"With outstretched hand across a darkened room,--"
7045,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"I groped among the inlets and the isles,"
7046,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,To find the passage to the Land of Spice.
7047,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"I have not found it yet,--but I have found"
7048,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Things worth the finding!
7049,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Son, have you forgot"
7050,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Those mellow autumn days, two years ago,"
7051,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"When first we sent our little ship _Half-Moon_,--"
7052,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"The flag of Holland floating at her peak,--"
7053,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Across a sandy bar, and sounded in"
7054,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Among the channels, to a goodly bay"
7055,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Where all the navies of the world could ride?
7056,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,A fertile island that the redmen called
7057,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Manhattan, lay above the bay: the land"
7058,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Around was bountiful and friendly fair.
7059,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,But never land was fair enough to hold
7060,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,The seaman from the calling of the sea.
7061,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"And so we bore to westward of the isle,"
7062,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Along a mighty inlet, where the tide"
7063,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Was troubled by a downward-flowing flood
7064,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"That seemed to come from far away,--perhaps"
7065,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,From some mysterious gulf of Tartary?
7066,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Inland we held our course; by palisades
7067,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Of naked rock; by rolling hills adorned
7068,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,With forests rich in timber for great ships;
7069,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Through narrows where the mountains shut us in
7070,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,With frowning cliffs that seemed to bar the stream;
7071,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,And then through open reaches where the banks
7072,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Sloped to the water gently, with their fields"
7073,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Of corn and lentils smiling in the sun.
7074,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Ten days we voyaged through that placid land,"
7075,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Until we came to shoals, and sent a boat"
7076,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Upstream to find,--what I already knew,--"
7077,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"We travelled on a river, not a strait."
7078,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,
7079,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,But what a river! God has never poured
7080,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,A stream more royal through a land more rich.
7081,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Even now I see it flowing in my dream,"
7082,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,While coming ages people it with men
7083,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Of manhood equal to the river's pride.
7084,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,I see the wigwams of the redmen changed
7085,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"To ample houses, and the tiny plots"
7086,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,Of maize and green tobacco broadened out
7087,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"To prosperous farms, that spread o'er hill and dale"
7088,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,The many-coloured mantle of their crops.
7089,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,I see the terraced vineyard on the slope
7090,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Where now the fox-grape loops its tangled vine,"
7091,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"And cattle feeding where the red deer roam,"
7092,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,And wild-bees gathered into busy hives
7093,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,To store the silver comb with golden sweet;
7094,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,And all the promised land begins to flow
7095,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,With milk and honey. Stately manors rise
7096,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Along the banks, and castles top the hills,"
7097,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"And little villages grow populous with trade,"
7098,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Until the river runs as proudly as the Rhine,--"
7099,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,The thread that links a hundred towns and towers!
7100,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Now looking deeper in my dream, I see"
7101,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,A mighty city covering the isle
7102,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"They call Manhattan, equal in her state"
7103,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"To all the older capitals of earth,--"
7104,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"The gateway city of a golden world,--"
7105,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"A city girt with masts, and crowned with spires,"
7106,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"And swarming with a million busy men,"
7107,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,While to her open door across the bay
7108,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,The ships of all the nations flock like doves.
7109,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"My name will be remembered there, the world"
7110,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Will say, ""This river and this isle were found"
7111,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"By Henry Hudson, on his way to seek"
7112,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"The Northwest Passage."""
7113,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Yes, I seek it still,--"
7114,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,My great adventure and my guiding star!
7115,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"For look ye, friends, our voyage is not done;"
7116,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,We hold by hope as long as life endures!
7117,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Somewhere among these floating fields of ice,"
7118,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Somewhere along this westward widening bay,"
7119,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Somewhere beneath this luminous northern night,"
7120,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"The channel opens to the Farthest East,--"
7121,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"I know it,--and some day a little ship"
7122,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Will push her bowsprit in, and battle through!"
7123,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"And why not ours,--to-morrow,--who can tell?"
7124,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,The lucky chance awaits the fearless heart!
7125,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,These are the longest days of all the year;
7126,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"The world is round and God is everywhere,"
7127,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,And while our shallop floats we still can steer.
7128,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,
7129,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"So point her up, John King, nor'west by north"
7130,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,We'll keep the honour of a certain aim
7131,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Amid the peril of uncertain ways,"

7790,X,The glory of our life below

7810,XI,Fair as a flower in that forsaken spot;
7811,XI,"What sweeter music shall we bring,"
7812,XI,To weave a harmony divine
7813,XI,Of prayer and holy thought
7814,XI,"Into the labours of this loftier shrine,"
7815,XI,"This consecrated hill,"
7816,XI,Where through so many a year

7848,XII,Enlarge our vision to behold

7887,I,Its random raptures and its festivals
7888,I,"Of noisy mirth,"

7969,IV,"Not spacious pleasure courts,"

7971,IV,Where devotees of sports
7972,IV,Mistake a pastime for life's highest aim;
7973,IV,"Not fashion, nor renown"
7974,IV,Of wealthy patronage and rich estate;
7975,IV,"No, none of these can crown"
7976,IV,A school with light and make it truly great.
7977,IV,"But masters, strong and wise,"
7978,IV,"Who teach because they love the teacher's task,"
7979,IV,And find their richest prize
7980,IV,In eyes that open and in minds that ask;
7981,IV,"And boys, with heart aglow"
7982,IV,"To try their youthful vigour on their work,"
7983,IV,"Eager to learn and grow,"
7984,IV,And quick to hate a coward or a shirk:
7985,IV,"These constitute a school,--"
7986,IV,"A vital forge of weapons keen and bright,"
7987,IV,Where living sword and tool
7988,IV,Are tempered for true toil or noble fight!
7989,IV,But let not wisdom scorn
7990,IV,The hours of pleasure in the playing fields:
7991,IV,"There also strength is born,"
7992,IV,And every manly game a virtue yields.
7993,IV,"Fairness and self-control,"
7994,IV,"Good-humour, pluck, and patience in the race,"

8271,THE CONSTELLATION,
8272,THE CONSTELLATION,"How strange that the nature of light is a thing beyond our ken,"
8273,THE CONSTELLATION,And the flame of the tiniest candle flows from a fountain sealed!
8274,THE CONSTELLATION,"How strange that the meaning of life, in the little lives of men,"
8275,THE CONSTELLATION,So often baffles our search with a mystery unrevealed!
8276,THE CONSTELLATION,
8277,THE CONSTELLATION,"But the larger life of man, as it moves in its secular sweep,"
8278,THE CONSTELLATION,Is the working out of a Sovereign Will whose ways appear;
8279,THE CONSTELLATION,"And the course of the journeying stars on the dark blue boundless deep,"
8280,THE CONSTELLATION,Is the place where our science rests in the reign of law most clear.
8281,THE CONSTELLATION,
8282,THE CONSTELLATION,I would read the story of Texas as if it were written on high;
8283,THE CONSTELLATION,I would look from afar to follow her path through the calms and storms;
8284,THE CONSTELLATION,"With a faith in the worldwide sway of the Reason that rules in the sky,"

8293,THE CONSTELLATION,They were drawn together and moved by a common hope and aim--

8295,THE CONSTELLATION,"The soul of a people spoke in their call, and Texas came"
8296,THE CONSTELLATION,To enter the splendid circle of States in their onward march.
8297,THE CONSTELLATION,
8298,THE CONSTELLATION,"So the glory gathered and grew and spread from sea to sea,"
8299,THE CONSTELLATION,And the stars of the great republic lent each other light;
8300,THE CONSTELLATION,"For all were bound together in strength, and each was free--"
8301,THE CONSTELLATION,Suddenly broke the tempest out of the ancient night!
8302,THE CONSTELLATION,
8303,THE CONSTELLATION,It came as a clash of the force that drives and the force that draws;
8304,THE CONSTELLATION,"And the stars were riven asunder, the heavens were desolate,"
8305,THE CONSTELLATION,"While brother fought with brother, each for his country's cause:"
8306,THE CONSTELLATION,"But the country of one was the Nation, the country of other the State."
8307,THE CONSTELLATION,
8308,THE CONSTELLATION,"Oh, who shall measure the praise or blame in a strife so vast?"
8309,THE CONSTELLATION,And who shall speak of traitors or tyrants when all were true?
8310,THE CONSTELLATION,"We lift our eyes to the sky, and rejoice that the storm is past,"
8311,THE CONSTELLATION,And we thank the God of all that the Union shines in the blue.
8312,THE CONSTELLATION,
8313,THE CONSTELLATION,"Yea, it glows with the glory of peace and the hope of a mighty race,"
8314,THE CONSTELLATION,High over the grave of broken chains and buried hates;
8315,THE CONSTELLATION,"And the great, big star of Texas is shining clear in its place"
8316,THE CONSTELLATION,In the constellate symbol and sign of the free United States.

8614,VI,"That led ten thousand children long ago,"
8615,VI,"A flock of innocents, deceived, betrayed,"
8616,VI,Yet pressing on through want and woe
8617,VI,"To meet their fate, faithful and unafraid?"
8618,VI,"Nay, for a million children now"
8619,VI,"Are marching in the long pathetic line,"
8620,VI,With weary step and early wrinkled brow;
8621,VI,And at their head appears no holy sign
8622,VI,Of hope in heaven;
8623,VI,For unto them is given
8624,VI,"No cross to carry, but a cross to drag."
8625,VI,Before their strength is ripe they bear
8626,VI,"The load of labour, toiling underground"
8627,VI,In dangerous mines and breathing heavy air
8628,VI,Of crowded shops; their tender lives are bound
8629,VI,"To service of the whirling, clattering wheels"
8630,VI,That fill the factories with dust and noise;
8631,VI,"They are not girls and boys,"
8632,VI,"But little ""hands"" who blindly, dumbly feed"
8633,VI,With their own blood the hungry god of Greed.
8634,VI,"Robbed of their natural joys,"
8635,VI,"And wounded with a scar that never heals,"
8636,VI,"They stumble on with heavy-laden soul,"
8637,VI,And fall by thousands on the highway lined
8638,VI,With little graves; or reach at last their goal
8639,VI,"Of stunted manhood and embittered age,"
8640,VI,"To brood awhile with dark and troubled mind,"

10936,THE SYMPHONY,"To bear the chain of the imperfect word,"

10954,THE SYMPHONY,
10955,THE SYMPHONY,"All these are thine, and therefore love is thine."
10956,THE SYMPHONY,"For love is joy and grief,"

10958,THE SYMPHONY,"And fear, and hope, and longing unexpressed,"
10959,THE SYMPHONY,"In pain most human, and in rapture brief"
10960,THE SYMPHONY,Almost divine.
10961,THE SYMPHONY,"Love would possess, yet deepens when denied;"

10963,THE SYMPHONY,Love like a prince his triumph would achieve;
10964,THE SYMPHONY,And like a miser in the dark his joys would hide.
10965,THE SYMPHONY,"Love is most bold,"
10966,THE SYMPHONY,He leads his dreams like armèd men in line;
10967,THE SYMPHONY,"Yet when the siege is set, and he must speak,"
10968,THE SYMPHONY,Calling the fortress to resign
10969,THE SYMPHONY,"Its treasure, valiant love grows weak,"
10970,THE SYMPHONY,And hardly dares his purpose to unfold.
10971,THE SYMPHONY,Less with his faltering lips than with his eyes
10972,THE SYMPHONY,He claims the longed-for prize:
10973,THE SYMPHONY,"Love fain would tell it all, yet leaves the best untold."
10974,THE SYMPHONY,"But thou shalt speak for love. Yea, thou shalt teach"
10975,THE SYMPHONY,"The mystery of measured tone,"

10979,THE SYMPHONY,"Diminished chords that quiver with desire,"
10980,THE SYMPHONY,"And major chords that glow with perfect peace,--"
10981,THE SYMPHONY,Have fallen from above;
10982,THE SYMPHONY,And thou canst give release
10983,THE SYMPHONY,In music to the burdened heart of love.
10984,THE SYMPHONY,
10985,THE SYMPHONY,"Sound with the 'cellos' pleading, passionate strain"
10986,THE SYMPHONY,"The yearning theme, and let the flute reply"

10988,THE SYMPHONY,"And sob, and sigh,"
10989,THE SYMPHONY,With muted string;
10990,THE SYMPHONY,Then let the oboe half-reluctant sing
10991,THE SYMPHONY,"Of bliss that trembles on the verge of pain,"
10992,THE SYMPHONY,"While 'cellos plead and plead again,"
10993,THE SYMPHONY,"With throbbing notes delayed, that would impart"
10994,THE SYMPHONY,To every urgent tone the beating of the heart.
10995,THE SYMPHONY,"So runs the andante, making plain"
10996,THE SYMPHONY,The hopes and fears of love without a word.
10997,THE SYMPHONY,"Then comes the adagio, with a yielding theme"
10998,THE SYMPHONY,"Through which the violas flow soft as in a dream,"
10999,THE SYMPHONY,While horns and mild bassoons are heard
11000,THE SYMPHONY,"In tender tune, that seems to float"
11001,THE SYMPHONY,Like an enchanted boat
11002,THE SYMPHONY,"Upon the downward-gliding stream,"
11003,THE SYMPHONY,"Toward the allegro's wide, bright sea"
11004,THE SYMPHONY,"Of dancing, glittering, blending tone,"
11005,THE SYMPHONY,"Where every instrument is sounding free,"
11006,THE SYMPHONY,"And harps like wedding-chimes are rung, and trumpets blown"
11007,THE SYMPHONY,Around the barque of love

11160,THE OLD FLUTE,This polished flute: the stops will not obey
11161,THE OLD FLUTE,My gnarled fingers; and the air it weaves
11162,THE OLD FLUTE,"In modulations, like a vine with leaves"
11163,THE OLD FLUTE,"Climbing around the tower of song, will die"
11164,THE OLD FLUTE,"In rustling autumn rhythms, confused and dry."
11165,THE OLD FLUTE,My shortened breath no more will freely fill
11166,THE OLD FLUTE,This magic reed with melody at will;
11167,THE OLD FLUTE,My stiffened lips will try and try in vain
11168,THE OLD FLUTE,"To wake the liquid, leaping, dancing strain;"
11169,THE OLD FLUTE,"The heavy notes will falter, wheeze, and faint,"
11170,THE OLD FLUTE,Or mock my ear with shrillness of complaint.

11172,THE OLD FLUTE,Then let me hang this faithful friend of mine
11173,THE OLD FLUTE,"Upon the trunk of some old, sacred pine,"

11186,THE OLD FLUTE,"That sprinkle drops of music everywhere,"
11187,THE OLD FLUTE,Lord of the sea of melody that laves
11188,THE OLD FLUTE,"The universe with never silent waves,--"
11189,THE OLD FLUTE,Him will I thank that this brief breath of mine
11190,THE OLD FLUTE,Has caught one cadence of the song divine;
11191,THE OLD FLUTE,And these frail fingers learned to rise and fall
11192,THE OLD FLUTE,In time with that great tune which throbs thro' all;
11193,THE OLD FLUTE,And these poor lips have lent a lilt of joy
11194,THE OLD FLUTE,To songless men whom weary tasks employ!
11195,THE OLD FLUTE,"My life has had its music, and my heart"
11196,THE OLD FLUTE,"In harmony has borne a little part,"

12257,RUAHMAH:,But one brief message came:

12264,SABALLIDIN:,His eyes are dimmed so that he scarce can see;
12265,SABALLIDIN:,His ears are dulled; his fearless face is pale

12641,RUAHMAH:,Between us who shall win the higher crown!
12642,RUAHMAH:,Men boast them of a friendship stronger far
12643,RUAHMAH:,"Than love of woman. Prove it! I'll not boast,"
12644,RUAHMAH:,But I'll contend with you on equal terms
12645,RUAHMAH:,In this brave race: and if you win the prize
12646,RUAHMAH:,I'll hold you next to him: and if I win
12647,RUAHMAH:,He'll hold you next to me; and either way
12648,RUAHMAH:,We'll not be far apart. Do you accept
12649,RUAHMAH:,My challenge?
12650,RUAHMAH:,
12651,SABALLIDIN:,SABALLIDIN:
12652,SABALLIDIN:,Yes! For you enforce my heart
12653,SABALLIDIN:,"By honour to resign its great desire,"
12654,SABALLIDIN:,And love itself to offer sacrifice
12655,SABALLIDIN:,Of all disloyal dreams on its own altar.
12656,SABALLIDIN:,"Yet love remains; therefore I pray you, think"
12657,SABALLIDIN:,How surely you must lose in our contention.
12658,SABALLIDIN:,For I am known to Naaman: but you
12659,SABALLIDIN:,He blindly takes for Tsarpi. 'Tis to her
12660,SABALLIDIN:,He gives his gratitude: the praise you win
12661,SABALLIDIN:,Endears her name.
12662,SABALLIDIN:,
12663,RUAHMAH:,RUAHMAH:
12664,RUAHMAH:,"Her name? Why, what is that?"
12665,RUAHMAH:,"A name is but an empty shell, a mask"
12666,RUAHMAH:,That does not change the features of the face
12667,RUAHMAH:,"Beneath it. Can a name rejoice, or weep,"
12668,RUAHMAH:,Or hope? Can it be moved by tenderness
12669,RUAHMAH:,"To daily services of love, or feel the warmth"
12670,RUAHMAH:,Of dear companionship? How many things
12671,RUAHMAH:,We call by names that have no meaning! Kings
12672,RUAHMAH:,That cannot rule; and gods that are not good;
12673,RUAHMAH:,And wives that do not love! It matters not
12674,RUAHMAH:,"What syllables he utters when he calls,"
12675,RUAHMAH:,"'Tis I who come,--'tis I who minister"
12676,RUAHMAH:,"Unto my lord, and mine the living heart"
12677,RUAHMAH:,"That feels the comfort of his confidence,"
12678,RUAHMAH:,"The thrill of gladness when he speaks to me,--"

12681,SABALLIDIN:,SABALLIDIN:
12682,SABALLIDIN:,"And yet, be sure"
12683,SABALLIDIN:,"There's danger in this error,--and no gain!"
12684,SABALLIDIN:,
12685,RUAHMAH:,RUAHMAH:
12686,RUAHMAH:,I seek no gain: I only tread the path
12687,RUAHMAH:,Marked for me daily by the hand of love.
12688,RUAHMAH:,And if his blindness spared my lord one pang
12689,RUAHMAH:,"Of sorrow in his black, forsaken hour,--"
12690,RUAHMAH:,And if this error makes his burdened heart
12691,RUAHMAH:,"More quiet, and his shadowed way less dark,"
12692,RUAHMAH:,Whom do I rob? Not her who chose to stay
12693,RUAHMAH:,At ease in Rimmon's House! Surely not him!
12694,RUAHMAH:,Only myself! And that enriches me.

13290,NUBTA:,for the sake of the House of Rimmon. A wife knows her

13343,SHUMAKIM:,the gods never lose. But for the protection of the
13344,SHUMAKIM:,"common people and the rest of us fools, I would rather"

13805,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13806,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"Come all ye good Centurions and wise men of the times,"
13807,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"You've made a Poet Laureate, now you must hear his rhymes."
13808,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,Extend your ears and I'll respond by shortening up my tale:--
13809,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"Man cannot live by verse alone, he must have cakes and ale."
13810,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13811,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"So while you wait for better things and muse on schnapps and salad,"
13812,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,I'll try my Pegasus his wings and sing a little ballad:
13813,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"A legend of your ancestors, the Wise Men of the East,"
13814,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,Who brought among their baggage train a quaint and curious beast.
13815,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13816,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"Their horses were both swift and strong, and we should think it lucky"
13817,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"If we could buy, by telephone, such horses from Kentucky;"
13818,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"Their dromedaries paced along, magnificent and large,"
13819,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,Their camels were as stately as if painted by La Farge.
13820,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13821,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"But this amazing little ass was never satisfied,"
13822,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,He made more trouble every day than all the rest beside:
13823,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"His ears were long, his legs were short, his eyes were bleared and dim,"
13824,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"But nothing in the wide, wide world was good enough for him."
13825,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13826,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"He did not like the way they went, but lifted up his voice"
13827,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,And said that any other way would be a better choice.
13828,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"He braced his feet and stood his ground, and made the wise men wait,"
13829,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,While with his heels at all around he did recalcitrate.
13830,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13831,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"It mattered not how fair the land through which the road might run,"
13832,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,He found new causes for complaint with every Morning Sun:
13833,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"And when the shades of twilight fell and all the world grew nappy,"
13834,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"They tied him to his Evening Post, but still he was not happy."
13835,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13836,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"He thought his load was far too large, he thought his food was bad,"
13837,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"He thought the Star a poor affair, he thought the Wise Men mad:"
13838,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"He did not like to hear them laugh,--'twas childish to be jolly;"
13839,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"And if perchance they sang a hymn,--'twas sentimental folly!"
13840,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13841,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,So day by day this little beast performed his level best
13842,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"To make their life, in work and play, a burden to the rest:"
13843,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"And when they laid them down at night, he would not let them sleep,"
13844,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,But criticized the Universe with hee-haws loud and deep.
13845,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13846,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"One evening, as the Wise Men sat before their fire-lit tent,"
13847,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"And ate and drank and talked and sang, in grateful merriment,"
13848,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"The solemn donkey butted in, in his most solemn way,"
13849,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,And broke the happy meeting up with a portentous bray.
13850,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13851,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"""Now by my head,"" Balthazar said (his real name was Choate),"
13852,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"""We've had about enough of this! I'll put it to the vote."
13853,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"I move the donkey be dismissed; let's turn him out to grass,"
13854,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"And travel on our cheerful way, without the solemn ass."""
13855,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13856,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,The vote was aye! and with a whack the Wise Men drove him out;
13857,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"But still he wanders up and down, and all the world about;"
13858,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"You'll know him by his long, sad face and supercilious ways,"
13859,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,And likewise by his morning kicks and by his evening brays.
13860,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13861,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"But while we sit at Eagle Roost and make our Twelfth Night cheer,"
13862,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,Full well we know the solemn ass will not disturb us here:
13863,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"For pleasure rules the roost to-night, by order of the King,"
13864,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"And every one must play his part, and laugh, and likewise sing."
13865,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13866,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"The road of life is long, we know, and often hard to find,"
13867,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,And yet there's many a pleasant turn for men of cheerful mind:
13868,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"We've done our day's work honestly, we've earned the right to rest,"
13869,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,We'll take a cup of friendship now and spice it with a jest.
13870,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,
13871,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"A silent health to absent friends, their memories are bright!"
13872,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,A hearty health to all who keep the feast with us to-night!
13873,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"A health to dear Centuria, oh, may she long abide!"
13874,THE BALLAD OF THE SOLEMN ASS,"A health, a health to all the world,--and the solemn ass, _outside_!"

13882,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,
13883,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"Among the earliest saints of old, before the first Hegira,"
13884,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"I find the one whose name we hold, St. Nicholas of Myra:"
13885,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"The best-beloved name, I guess, in sacred nomenclature,--"
13886,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"The patron-saint of helpfulness, and friendship, and good-nature."
13887,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,
13888,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"A bishop and a preacher too, a famous theologian,"
13889,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,He stood against the Arian crew and fought them like a Trojan:
13890,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"But when a poor man told his need and begged an alms in trouble,"
13891,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"He never asked about his creed, but quickly gave him double."
13892,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,
13893,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"Three pretty maidens, so they say, were longing to be married;"
13894,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"But they were paupers, lack-a-day, and so the suitors tarried."
13895,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"St. Nicholas gave each maid a purse of golden ducats chinking,"
13896,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"And then, for better or for worse, they wedded quick as winking."
13897,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,
13898,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"Once, as he sailed, a storm arose; wild waves the ship surrounded;"
13899,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"The sailors wept and tore their clothes, and shrieked ""We'll all be"
13900,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"drownded!"""
13901,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,St. Nicholas never turned a hair; serenely shone his halo;
13902,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"He simply said a little prayer, and all the billows lay low."
13903,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,
13904,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"The wicked keeper of an inn had three small urchins taken,"
13905,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"And cut them up in a pickle-bin, and salted them for bacon."
13906,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"St. Nicholas came and picked them out, and put their limbs together,--"
13907,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"They lived, they leaped, they gave a shout, ""St. Nicholas forever!"""
13908,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,
13909,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"And thus it came to pass, you know, that maids without a nickel,"
13910,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"And sailor-lads when tempest blow, and children in a pickle,"
13911,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,"And every man that's fatherly, and every kindly matron,"
13912,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,In choosing saints would all agree to call St. Nicholas patron.
13913,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,
13914,A BALLAD OF SANTA CLAUS,He comes again at Christmas-time and stirs us up to giving;

13934,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"All hail, ye famous Farmers!"
13935,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Ye vegetable-charmers,"
13936,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Who know the art of making barren earth
13937,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Smile with prolific mirth
13938,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And bring forth twins or triplets at a birth!
13939,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Ye scientific fertilizers of the soil,"
13940,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And horny-handed sons of toil!
13941,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"To-night from all your arduous cares released,"
13942,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"With manly brows no longer sweat-impearled,"
13943,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Ye hold your annual feast,"

13945,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Ye meet above the ""Bridge"" below,"
13946,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And draw the cork heard round the world!
13947,ARS AGRICOLARIS,
13948,ARS AGRICOLARIS,What memories are yours! What tales
13949,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of triumph have your tongues rehearsed,"
13950,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Telling how ye have won your first
13951,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Potatoes from the stubborn mead,"
13952,ARS AGRICOLARIS,(Almost as many as ye sowed for seed!)
13953,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And how the luscious cabbages and kails
13954,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Have bloomed before you in their bed
13955,ARS AGRICOLARIS,At seven dollars a head!
13956,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And how your onions took a prize
13957,ARS AGRICOLARIS,For bringing tears into the eyes
13958,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Of a hard-hearted cook! And how ye slew
13959,ARS AGRICOLARIS,The Dragon Cut-worm at a stroke!
13960,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"And how ye broke,"
13961,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Routed, and put to flight the horrid crew"
13962,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Of vile potato-bugs and Hessian flies!
13963,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And how ye did not quail
13964,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Before th' invading armies of San José Scale,"
13965,ARS AGRICOLARIS,But met them bravely with your little pail
13966,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of poison, which ye put upon each tail"
13967,ARS AGRICOLARIS,O' the dreadful beasts and made their courage fail!
13968,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And how ye did acquit yourselves like men
13969,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"In fields of agricultural strife, and then,"
13970,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Like generous warriors, sat you down at ease"
13971,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"And gently to your gardener said, ""Let us have _Pease_!"""
13972,ARS AGRICOLARIS,
13973,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"But _were_ there Pease? Ah, no, dear Farmers, no!"
13974,ARS AGRICOLARIS,The course of Nature is not ordered so.
13975,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"For when we want a vegetable most,"
13976,ARS AGRICOLARIS,She holds it back;
13977,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And when we boast
13978,ARS AGRICOLARIS,To our week-endly friends
13979,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of what we'll give them on our farm, alack,"
13980,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Those things the old dam, Nature, never sends."
13981,ARS AGRICOLARIS,
13982,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"O Pease in bottles, Sparrow-grass in jars,"
13983,ARS AGRICOLARIS,How often have ye saved from scars
13984,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of shame, and deep embarrassment,"
13985,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"The disingenuous farmer-gent,"
13986,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"To whom some wondering guest has cried,"
13987,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"""How _do_ you raise such Pease and Sparrow-grass?"""
13988,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Whereat the farmer-gent has not denied
13989,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"The compliment, but smiling has replied,"
13990,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"""To raise such things you must have lots of glass."""
13991,ARS AGRICOLARIS,
13992,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"From wiles like these, true Farmers, hold aloof;"

13994,ARS AGRICOLARIS,If niggard Nature should withhold the green

13996,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Even the easy Radish, and the Beet,"
13997,ARS AGRICOLARIS,If grown by your own toil are extra sweet.
13998,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Let malefactors of great wealth and banker-felons
13999,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Rejoice in foreign artichokes, imported melons;"
14000,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"But you, my Farmers, at your frugal board"
14001,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Spread forth the fare your Sabine Farms afford.
14002,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Say to Mæcenas, when he is your guest,"
14003,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"""No peaches! try this turnip, 'tis my best."""
14004,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Thus shall ye learn from labors in the field
14005,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"What honesty a farmer's life may yield,"
14006,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"And like G. Washington in early youth,"
14007,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Though cherries fail, produce a crop of truth."
14008,ARS AGRICOLARIS,
14009,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"But think me not too strict, O followers of the plough;"
14010,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Some place for fiction in your lives I would allow.
14011,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"In January when the world is drear,"
14012,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"And bills come in, and no results appear,"
14013,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"And snow-storms veil the skies,"
14014,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"And ice the streamlet clogs,"
14015,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Then may you warm your heart with pleasant lies
14016,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And revel in the seedsmen's catalogues!
14017,ARS AGRICOLARIS,What visions and what dreams are these
14018,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of cauliflower obese,--"
14019,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of giant celery, taller than a mast,--"
14020,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Of strawberries
14021,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Like red pincushions, round and vast,--"
14022,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of succulent and spicy gumbo,--"
14023,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of cantaloupes, as big as Jumbo,--"
14024,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of high-strung beans without the strings,--"
14025,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"And of a host of other wild, romantic things!"
14026,ARS AGRICOLARIS,
14027,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Why, then, should Doctor Starr declare"
14028,ARS AGRICOLARIS,That modern habits mental force impair?
14029,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And why should H. Marquand complain
14030,ARS AGRICOLARIS,That jokes as good as his will never come again?
14031,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And why should Bridges wear a gloomy mien
14032,ARS AGRICOLARIS,About the lack of fiction for his Magazine?
14033,ARS AGRICOLARIS,The seedsman's catalogue is all we need
14034,ARS AGRICOLARIS,To stir our dull imaginations
14035,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"To new creations,"
14036,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"And lead us, by the hand"
14037,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"Of Hope, into a fairy-land."
14038,ARS AGRICOLARIS,
14039,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"So dream, my friendly Farmers, as you will;"
14040,ARS AGRICOLARIS,And let your fancy all your garners fill
14041,ARS AGRICOLARIS,With wondrous crops; but always recollect
14042,ARS AGRICOLARIS,That Nature gives us less than we expect.
14043,ARS AGRICOLARIS,Scorn not the city where you earn the wealth
14044,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"That, spent upon your farms, renews your health;"
14045,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"And tell your wife, whene'er the bills have shocked her,"
14046,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"""A country-place is cheaper than a doctor."""
14047,ARS AGRICOLARIS,"May roses bloom for you, and may you find"
