10,THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER
11,THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,
12,IN SEVEN PARTS,IN SEVEN PARTS
13,IN SEVEN PARTS,
14,IN SEVEN PARTS,By Samuel Taylor Coleridge
15,IN SEVEN PARTS,
16,IN SEVEN PARTS,
17,IN SEVEN PARTS,
18,PART THE FIRST.,PART THE FIRST.
19,PART THE FIRST.,
20,PART THE FIRST.,"It is an ancient Mariner,"
21,PART THE FIRST.,And he stoppeth one of three.
22,PART THE FIRST.,"""By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,"
23,PART THE FIRST.,Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
24,PART THE FIRST.,
25,PART THE FIRST.,"""The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,"
26,PART THE FIRST.,And I am next of kin;
27,PART THE FIRST.,"The guests are met, the feast is set:"
28,PART THE FIRST.,"May'st hear the merry din."""
29,PART THE FIRST.,
30,PART THE FIRST.,"He holds him with his skinny hand,"
31,PART THE FIRST.,"""There was a ship,"" quoth he."
32,PART THE FIRST.,"""Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!"""
33,PART THE FIRST.,Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
34,PART THE FIRST.,
35,PART THE FIRST.,He holds him with his glittering eye--
36,PART THE FIRST.,"The Wedding-Guest stood still,"
37,PART THE FIRST.,And listens like a three years child:
38,PART THE FIRST.,The Mariner hath his will.
39,PART THE FIRST.,
40,PART THE FIRST.,The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:
41,PART THE FIRST.,He cannot chuse but hear;
42,PART THE FIRST.,"And thus spake on that ancient man,"
43,PART THE FIRST.,The bright-eyed Mariner.
44,PART THE FIRST.,
45,PART THE FIRST.,"The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,"
46,PART THE FIRST.,Merrily did we drop
47,PART THE FIRST.,"Below the kirk, below the hill,"
48,PART THE FIRST.,Below the light-house top.
49,PART THE FIRST.,
50,PART THE FIRST.,"The Sun came up upon the left,"
51,PART THE FIRST.,Out of the sea came he!
52,PART THE FIRST.,"And he shone bright, and on the right"
53,PART THE FIRST.,Went down into the sea.
54,PART THE FIRST.,
55,PART THE FIRST.,"Higher and higher every day,"
56,PART THE FIRST.,Till over the mast at noon--
57,PART THE FIRST.,"The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,"
58,PART THE FIRST.,For he heard the loud bassoon.
59,PART THE FIRST.,
60,PART THE FIRST.,"The bride hath paced into the hall,"
61,PART THE FIRST.,Red as a rose is she;
62,PART THE FIRST.,Nodding their heads before her goes
63,PART THE FIRST.,The merry minstrelsy.
64,PART THE FIRST.,
65,PART THE FIRST.,"The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,"
66,PART THE FIRST.,Yet he cannot chuse but hear;
67,PART THE FIRST.,"And thus spake on that ancient man,"
68,PART THE FIRST.,The bright-eyed Mariner.
69,PART THE FIRST.,
70,PART THE FIRST.,"And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he"
71,PART THE FIRST.,Was tyrannous and strong:
72,PART THE FIRST.,"He struck with his o'ertaking wings,"
73,PART THE FIRST.,And chased south along.
74,PART THE FIRST.,
75,PART THE FIRST.,"With sloping masts and dipping prow,"
76,PART THE FIRST.,As who pursued with yell and blow
77,PART THE FIRST.,Still treads the shadow of his foe
78,PART THE FIRST.,"And forward bends his head,"
79,PART THE FIRST.,"The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,"
80,PART THE FIRST.,And southward aye we fled.
81,PART THE FIRST.,
82,PART THE FIRST.,"And now there came both mist and snow,"
83,PART THE FIRST.,And it grew wondrous cold:
84,PART THE FIRST.,"And ice, mast-high, came floating by,"
85,PART THE FIRST.,As green as emerald.
86,PART THE FIRST.,
87,PART THE FIRST.,And through the drifts the snowy clifts
88,PART THE FIRST.,Did send a dismal sheen:
89,PART THE FIRST.,Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--
90,PART THE FIRST.,The ice was all between.
91,PART THE FIRST.,
92,PART THE FIRST.,"The ice was here, the ice was there,"
93,PART THE FIRST.,The ice was all around:
94,PART THE FIRST.,"It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,"
95,PART THE FIRST.,Like noises in a swound!
96,PART THE FIRST.,
97,PART THE FIRST.,At length did cross an Albatross:
98,PART THE FIRST.,Thorough the fog it came;
99,PART THE FIRST.,"As if it had been a Christian soul,"
100,PART THE FIRST.,We hailed it in God's name.
101,PART THE FIRST.,
102,PART THE FIRST.,"It ate the food it ne'er had eat,"
103,PART THE FIRST.,And round and round it flew.
104,PART THE FIRST.,The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
105,PART THE FIRST.,The helmsman steered us through!
106,PART THE FIRST.,
107,PART THE FIRST.,And a good south wind sprung up behind;
108,PART THE FIRST.,"The Albatross did follow,"
109,PART THE FIRST.,"And every day, for food or play,"
110,PART THE FIRST.,Came to the mariners' hollo!
111,PART THE FIRST.,
112,PART THE FIRST.,"In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,"
113,PART THE FIRST.,It perched for vespers nine;
114,PART THE FIRST.,"Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,"
115,PART THE FIRST.,Glimmered the white Moon-shine.
116,PART THE FIRST.,
117,PART THE FIRST.,"""God save thee, ancient Mariner!"
118,PART THE FIRST.,"From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--"
119,PART THE FIRST.,"Why look'st thou so?""--With my cross-bow"
120,PART THE FIRST.,I shot the ALBATROSS.
121,PART THE FIRST.,
122,PART THE FIRST.,
123,PART THE FIRST.,
124,PART THE FIRST.,
125,PART THE SECOND.,PART THE SECOND.
126,PART THE SECOND.,
127,PART THE SECOND.,The Sun now rose upon the right:
128,PART THE SECOND.,"Out of the sea came he,"
129,PART THE SECOND.,"Still hid in mist, and on the left"
130,PART THE SECOND.,Went down into the sea.
131,PART THE SECOND.,
132,PART THE SECOND.,And the good south wind still blew behind
133,PART THE SECOND.,"But no sweet bird did follow,"
134,PART THE SECOND.,Nor any day for food or play
135,PART THE SECOND.,Came to the mariners' hollo!
136,PART THE SECOND.,
137,PART THE SECOND.,"And I had done an hellish thing,"
138,PART THE SECOND.,And it would work 'em woe:
139,PART THE SECOND.,"For all averred, I had killed the bird"
140,PART THE SECOND.,That made the breeze to blow.
141,PART THE SECOND.,"Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay"
142,PART THE SECOND.,That made the breeze to blow!
143,PART THE SECOND.,
144,PART THE SECOND.,"Nor dim nor red, like God's own head,"
145,PART THE SECOND.,The glorious Sun uprist:
146,PART THE SECOND.,"Then all averred, I had killed the bird"
147,PART THE SECOND.,That brought the fog and mist.
148,PART THE SECOND.,"'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,"
149,PART THE SECOND.,That bring the fog and mist.
150,PART THE SECOND.,
151,PART THE SECOND.,"The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,"
152,PART THE SECOND.,The furrow followed free:
153,PART THE SECOND.,We were the first that ever burst
154,PART THE SECOND.,Into that silent sea.
155,PART THE SECOND.,
156,PART THE SECOND.,"Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,"
157,PART THE SECOND.,'Twas sad as sad could be;
158,PART THE SECOND.,And we did speak only to break
159,PART THE SECOND.,The silence of the sea!
160,PART THE SECOND.,
161,PART THE SECOND.,"All in a hot and copper sky,"
162,PART THE SECOND.,"The bloody Sun, at noon,"
163,PART THE SECOND.,"Right up above the mast did stand,"
164,PART THE SECOND.,No bigger than the Moon.
165,PART THE SECOND.,
166,PART THE SECOND.,"Day after day, day after day,"
167,PART THE SECOND.,"We stuck, nor breath nor motion;"
168,PART THE SECOND.,As idle as a painted ship
169,PART THE SECOND.,Upon a painted ocean.
170,PART THE SECOND.,
171,PART THE SECOND.,"Water, water, every where,"
172,PART THE SECOND.,And all the boards did shrink;
173,PART THE SECOND.,"Water, water, every where,"
174,PART THE SECOND.,Nor any drop to drink.
175,PART THE SECOND.,
176,PART THE SECOND.,The very deep did rot: O Christ!
177,PART THE SECOND.,That ever this should be!
178,PART THE SECOND.,"Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs"
179,PART THE SECOND.,Upon the slimy sea.
180,PART THE SECOND.,
181,PART THE SECOND.,"About, about, in reel and rout"
182,PART THE SECOND.,The death-fires danced at night;
183,PART THE SECOND.,"The water, like a witch's oils,"
184,PART THE SECOND.,"Burnt green, and blue and white."
185,PART THE SECOND.,
186,PART THE SECOND.,And some in dreams assured were
187,PART THE SECOND.,Of the spirit that plagued us so:
188,PART THE SECOND.,Nine fathom deep he had followed us
189,PART THE SECOND.,From the land of mist and snow.
190,PART THE SECOND.,
191,PART THE SECOND.,"And every tongue, through utter drought,"
192,PART THE SECOND.,Was withered at the root;
193,PART THE SECOND.,"We could not speak, no more than if"
194,PART THE SECOND.,We had been choked with soot.
195,PART THE SECOND.,
196,PART THE SECOND.,Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
197,PART THE SECOND.,Had I from old and young!
198,PART THE SECOND.,"Instead of the cross, the Albatross"
199,PART THE SECOND.,About my neck was hung.
200,PART THE SECOND.,
201,PART THE SECOND.,
202,PART THE SECOND.,
203,PART THE SECOND.,
204,PART THE THIRD.,PART THE THIRD.
205,PART THE THIRD.,
206,PART THE THIRD.,There passed a weary time.  Each throat
207,PART THE THIRD.,"Was parched, and glazed each eye."
208,PART THE THIRD.,A weary time! a weary time!
209,PART THE THIRD.,"How glazed each weary eye,"
210,PART THE THIRD.,"When looking westward, I beheld"
211,PART THE THIRD.,A something in the sky.
212,PART THE THIRD.,
213,PART THE THIRD.,"At first it seemed a little speck,"
214,PART THE THIRD.,And then it seemed a mist:
215,PART THE THIRD.,"It moved and moved, and took at last"
216,PART THE THIRD.,"A certain shape, I wist."
217,PART THE THIRD.,
218,PART THE THIRD.,"A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!"
219,PART THE THIRD.,And still it neared and neared:
220,PART THE THIRD.,"As if it dodged a water-sprite,"
221,PART THE THIRD.,It plunged and tacked and veered.
222,PART THE THIRD.,
223,PART THE THIRD.,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
224,PART THE THIRD.,We could not laugh nor wail;
225,PART THE THIRD.,Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
226,PART THE THIRD.,"I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,"
227,PART THE THIRD.,"And cried, A sail! a sail!"
228,PART THE THIRD.,
229,PART THE THIRD.,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
230,PART THE THIRD.,Agape they heard me call:
231,PART THE THIRD.,"Gramercy! they for joy did grin,"
232,PART THE THIRD.,"And all at once their breath drew in,"
233,PART THE THIRD.,As they were drinking all.
234,PART THE THIRD.,
235,PART THE THIRD.,See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
236,PART THE THIRD.,Hither to work us weal;
237,PART THE THIRD.,"Without a breeze, without a tide,"
238,PART THE THIRD.,She steadies with upright keel!
239,PART THE THIRD.,
240,PART THE THIRD.,The western wave was all a-flame
241,PART THE THIRD.,The day was well nigh done!
242,PART THE THIRD.,Almost upon the western wave
243,PART THE THIRD.,Rested the broad bright Sun;
244,PART THE THIRD.,When that strange shape drove suddenly
245,PART THE THIRD.,Betwixt us and the Sun.
246,PART THE THIRD.,
247,PART THE THIRD.,"And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,"
248,PART THE THIRD.,(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
249,PART THE THIRD.,"As if through a dungeon-grate he peered,"
250,PART THE THIRD.,With broad and burning face.
251,PART THE THIRD.,
252,PART THE THIRD.,"Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)"
253,PART THE THIRD.,How fast she nears and nears!
254,PART THE THIRD.,"Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,"
255,PART THE THIRD.,Like restless gossameres!
256,PART THE THIRD.,
257,PART THE THIRD.,Are those her ribs through which the Sun
258,PART THE THIRD.,"Did peer, as through a grate?"
259,PART THE THIRD.,And is that Woman all her crew?
260,PART THE THIRD.,Is that a DEATH? and are there two?
261,PART THE THIRD.,Is DEATH that woman's mate?
262,PART THE THIRD.,
263,PART THE THIRD.,"Her lips were red, her looks were free,"
264,PART THE THIRD.,Her locks were yellow as gold:
265,PART THE THIRD.,"Her skin was as white as leprosy,"
266,PART THE THIRD.,"The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,"
267,PART THE THIRD.,Who thicks man's blood with cold.
268,PART THE THIRD.,
269,PART THE THIRD.,"The naked hulk alongside came,"
270,PART THE THIRD.,And the twain were casting dice;
271,PART THE THIRD.,"""The game is done!  I've won!  I've won!"""
272,PART THE THIRD.,"Quoth she, and whistles thrice."
273,PART THE THIRD.,
274,PART THE THIRD.,The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out:
275,PART THE THIRD.,At one stride comes the dark;
276,PART THE THIRD.,"With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea."
277,PART THE THIRD.,Off shot the spectre-bark.
278,PART THE THIRD.,
279,PART THE THIRD.,We listened and looked sideways up!
280,PART THE THIRD.,"Fear at my heart, as at a cup,"
281,PART THE THIRD.,My life-blood seemed to sip!
282,PART THE THIRD.,
283,PART THE THIRD.,"The stars were dim, and thick the night,"
284,PART THE THIRD.,The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
285,PART THE THIRD.,From the sails the dew did drip--
286,PART THE THIRD.,Till clombe above the eastern bar
287,PART THE THIRD.,"The horned Moon, with one bright star"
288,PART THE THIRD.,Within the nether tip.
289,PART THE THIRD.,
290,PART THE THIRD.,"One after one, by the star-dogged Moon"
291,PART THE THIRD.,"Too quick for groan or sigh,"
292,PART THE THIRD.,"Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,"
293,PART THE THIRD.,And cursed me with his eye.
294,PART THE THIRD.,
295,PART THE THIRD.,"Four times fifty living men,"
296,PART THE THIRD.,(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
297,PART THE THIRD.,"With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,"
298,PART THE THIRD.,They dropped down one by one.
299,PART THE THIRD.,
300,PART THE THIRD.,"The souls did from their bodies fly,--"
301,PART THE THIRD.,They fled to bliss or woe!
302,PART THE THIRD.,"And every soul, it passed me by,"
303,PART THE THIRD.,Like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW!
304,PART THE THIRD.,
305,PART THE THIRD.,
306,PART THE THIRD.,
307,PART THE THIRD.,
308,PART THE FOURTH.,PART THE FOURTH.
309,PART THE FOURTH.,
310,PART THE FOURTH.,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"
311,PART THE FOURTH.,I fear thy skinny hand!
312,PART THE FOURTH.,"And thou art long, and lank, and brown,"
313,PART THE FOURTH.,As is the ribbed sea-sand.
314,PART THE FOURTH.,
315,PART THE FOURTH.,"""I fear thee and thy glittering eye,"
316,PART THE FOURTH.,"And thy skinny hand, so brown.""--"
317,PART THE FOURTH.,"Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!"
318,PART THE FOURTH.,This body dropt not down.
319,PART THE FOURTH.,
320,PART THE FOURTH.,"Alone, alone, all, all alone,"
321,PART THE FOURTH.,Alone on a wide wide sea!
322,PART THE FOURTH.,And never a saint took pity on
323,PART THE FOURTH.,My soul in agony.
324,PART THE FOURTH.,
325,PART THE FOURTH.,"The many men, so beautiful!"
326,PART THE FOURTH.,And they all dead did lie:
327,PART THE FOURTH.,And a thousand thousand slimy things
328,PART THE FOURTH.,Lived on; and so did I.
329,PART THE FOURTH.,
330,PART THE FOURTH.,"I looked upon the rotting sea,"
331,PART THE FOURTH.,And drew my eyes away;
332,PART THE FOURTH.,"I looked upon the rotting deck,"
333,PART THE FOURTH.,And there the dead men lay.
334,PART THE FOURTH.,
335,PART THE FOURTH.,"I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray:"
336,PART THE FOURTH.,"But or ever a prayer had gusht,"
337,PART THE FOURTH.,"A wicked whisper came, and made"
338,PART THE FOURTH.,my heart as dry as dust.
339,PART THE FOURTH.,
340,PART THE FOURTH.,"I closed my lids, and kept them close,"
341,PART THE FOURTH.,And the balls like pulses beat;
342,PART THE FOURTH.,"For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky"
343,PART THE FOURTH.,"Lay like a load on my weary eye,"
344,PART THE FOURTH.,And the dead were at my feet.
345,PART THE FOURTH.,
346,PART THE FOURTH.,"The cold sweat melted from their limbs,"
347,PART THE FOURTH.,Nor rot nor reek did they:
348,PART THE FOURTH.,The look with which they looked on me
349,PART THE FOURTH.,Had never passed away.
350,PART THE FOURTH.,
351,PART THE FOURTH.,An orphan's curse would drag to Hell
352,PART THE FOURTH.,A spirit from on high;
353,PART THE FOURTH.,But oh! more horrible than that
354,PART THE FOURTH.,Is a curse in a dead man's eye!
355,PART THE FOURTH.,"Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,"
356,PART THE FOURTH.,And yet I could not die.
357,PART THE FOURTH.,
358,PART THE FOURTH.,"The moving Moon went up the sky,"
359,PART THE FOURTH.,And no where did abide:
360,PART THE FOURTH.,"Softly she was going up,"
361,PART THE FOURTH.,And a star or two beside.
362,PART THE FOURTH.,
363,PART THE FOURTH.,"Her beams bemocked the sultry main,"
364,PART THE FOURTH.,Like April hoar-frost spread;
365,PART THE FOURTH.,"But where the ship's huge shadow lay,"
366,PART THE FOURTH.,The charmed water burnt alway
367,PART THE FOURTH.,A still and awful red.
368,PART THE FOURTH.,
369,PART THE FOURTH.,"Beyond the shadow of the ship,"
370,PART THE FOURTH.,I watched the water-snakes:
371,PART THE FOURTH.,"They moved in tracks of shining white,"
372,PART THE FOURTH.,"And when they reared, the elfish light"
373,PART THE FOURTH.,Fell off in hoary flakes.
374,PART THE FOURTH.,
375,PART THE FOURTH.,Within the shadow of the ship
376,PART THE FOURTH.,I watched their rich attire:
377,PART THE FOURTH.,"Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,"
378,PART THE FOURTH.,They coiled and swam; and every track
379,PART THE FOURTH.,Was a flash of golden fire.
380,PART THE FOURTH.,
381,PART THE FOURTH.,O happy living things! no tongue
382,PART THE FOURTH.,Their beauty might declare:
383,PART THE FOURTH.,"A spring of love gushed from my heart,"
384,PART THE FOURTH.,And I blessed them unaware:
385,PART THE FOURTH.,"Sure my kind saint took pity on me,"
386,PART THE FOURTH.,And I blessed them unaware.
387,PART THE FOURTH.,
388,PART THE FOURTH.,The self same moment I could pray;
389,PART THE FOURTH.,And from my neck so free
390,PART THE FOURTH.,"The Albatross fell off, and sank"
391,PART THE FOURTH.,Like lead into the sea.
392,PART THE FOURTH.,
393,PART THE FOURTH.,
394,PART THE FOURTH.,
395,PART THE FOURTH.,
396,PART THE FIFTH.,PART THE FIFTH.
397,PART THE FIFTH.,
398,PART THE FIFTH.,"Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,"
399,PART THE FIFTH.,Beloved from pole to pole!
400,PART THE FIFTH.,To Mary Queen the praise be given!
401,PART THE FIFTH.,"She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,"
402,PART THE FIFTH.,That slid into my soul.
403,PART THE FIFTH.,
404,PART THE FIFTH.,"The silly buckets on the deck,"
405,PART THE FIFTH.,"That had so long remained,"
406,PART THE FIFTH.,I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
407,PART THE FIFTH.,"And when I awoke, it rained."
408,PART THE FIFTH.,
409,PART THE FIFTH.,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,"
410,PART THE FIFTH.,My garments all were dank;
411,PART THE FIFTH.,"Sure I had drunken in my dreams,"
412,PART THE FIFTH.,And still my body drank.
413,PART THE FIFTH.,
414,PART THE FIFTH.,"I moved, and could not feel my limbs:"
415,PART THE FIFTH.,I was so light--almost
416,PART THE FIFTH.,"I thought that I had died in sleep,"
417,PART THE FIFTH.,And was a blessed ghost.
418,PART THE FIFTH.,
419,PART THE FIFTH.,And soon I heard a roaring wind:
420,PART THE FIFTH.,It did not come anear;
421,PART THE FIFTH.,"But with its sound it shook the sails,"
422,PART THE FIFTH.,That were so thin and sere.
423,PART THE FIFTH.,
424,PART THE FIFTH.,The upper air burst into life!
425,PART THE FIFTH.,"And a hundred fire-flags sheen,"
426,PART THE FIFTH.,To and fro they were hurried about!
427,PART THE FIFTH.,"And to and fro, and in and out,"
428,PART THE FIFTH.,The wan stars danced between.
429,PART THE FIFTH.,
430,PART THE FIFTH.,"And the coming wind did roar more loud,"
431,PART THE FIFTH.,And the sails did sigh like sedge;
432,PART THE FIFTH.,And the rain poured down from one black cloud;
433,PART THE FIFTH.,The Moon was at its edge.
434,PART THE FIFTH.,
435,PART THE FIFTH.,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still"
436,PART THE FIFTH.,The Moon was at its side:
437,PART THE FIFTH.,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
438,PART THE FIFTH.,"The lightning fell with never a jag,"
439,PART THE FIFTH.,A river steep and wide.
440,PART THE FIFTH.,
441,PART THE FIFTH.,"The loud wind never reached the ship,"
442,PART THE FIFTH.,Yet now the ship moved on!
443,PART THE FIFTH.,Beneath the lightning and the Moon
444,PART THE FIFTH.,The dead men gave a groan.
445,PART THE FIFTH.,
446,PART THE FIFTH.,"They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,"
447,PART THE FIFTH.,"Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;"
448,PART THE FIFTH.,"It had been strange, even in a dream,"
449,PART THE FIFTH.,To have seen those dead men rise.
450,PART THE FIFTH.,
451,PART THE FIFTH.,"The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;"
452,PART THE FIFTH.,Yet never a breeze up blew;
453,PART THE FIFTH.,"The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,"
454,PART THE FIFTH.,Where they were wont to do:
455,PART THE FIFTH.,They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--
456,PART THE FIFTH.,We were a ghastly crew.
457,PART THE FIFTH.,
458,PART THE FIFTH.,"The body of my brother's son,"
459,PART THE FIFTH.,"Stood by me, knee to knee:"
460,PART THE FIFTH.,"The body and I pulled at one rope,"
461,PART THE FIFTH.,But he said nought to me.
462,PART THE FIFTH.,
463,PART THE FIFTH.,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"""
464,PART THE FIFTH.,"Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!"
465,PART THE FIFTH.,"'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,"
466,PART THE FIFTH.,"Which to their corses came again,"
467,PART THE FIFTH.,But a troop of spirits blest:
468,PART THE FIFTH.,
469,PART THE FIFTH.,"For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,"
470,PART THE FIFTH.,And clustered round the mast;
471,PART THE FIFTH.,"Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,"
472,PART THE FIFTH.,And from their bodies passed.
473,PART THE FIFTH.,
474,PART THE FIFTH.,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
475,PART THE FIFTH.,Then darted to the Sun;
476,PART THE FIFTH.,"Slowly the sounds came back again,"
477,PART THE FIFTH.,"Now mixed, now one by one."
478,PART THE FIFTH.,
479,PART THE FIFTH.,Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
480,PART THE FIFTH.,I heard the sky-lark sing;
481,PART THE FIFTH.,"Sometimes all little birds that are,"
482,PART THE FIFTH.,How they seemed to fill the sea and air
483,PART THE FIFTH.,With their sweet jargoning!
484,PART THE FIFTH.,
485,PART THE FIFTH.,"And now 'twas like all instruments,"
486,PART THE FIFTH.,Now like a lonely flute;
487,PART THE FIFTH.,"And now it is an angel's song,"
488,PART THE FIFTH.,That makes the Heavens be mute.
489,PART THE FIFTH.,
490,PART THE FIFTH.,It ceased; yet still the sails made on
491,PART THE FIFTH.,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
492,PART THE FIFTH.,A noise like of a hidden brook
493,PART THE FIFTH.,"In the leafy month of June,"
494,PART THE FIFTH.,That to the sleeping woods all night
495,PART THE FIFTH.,Singeth a quiet tune.
496,PART THE FIFTH.,
497,PART THE FIFTH.,"Till noon we quietly sailed on,"
498,PART THE FIFTH.,Yet never a breeze did breathe:
499,PART THE FIFTH.,"Slowly and smoothly went the ship,"
500,PART THE FIFTH.,Moved onward from beneath.
501,PART THE FIFTH.,
502,PART THE FIFTH.,"Under the keel nine fathom deep,"
503,PART THE FIFTH.,"From the land of mist and snow,"
504,PART THE FIFTH.,The spirit slid: and it was he
505,PART THE FIFTH.,That made the ship to go.
506,PART THE FIFTH.,"The sails at noon left off their tune,"
507,PART THE FIFTH.,And the ship stood still also.
508,PART THE FIFTH.,
509,PART THE FIFTH.,"The Sun, right up above the mast,"
510,PART THE FIFTH.,Had fixed her to the ocean:
511,PART THE FIFTH.,"But in a minute she 'gan stir,"
512,PART THE FIFTH.,With a short uneasy motion--
513,PART THE FIFTH.,Backwards and forwards half her length
514,PART THE FIFTH.,With a short uneasy motion.
515,PART THE FIFTH.,
516,PART THE FIFTH.,"Then like a pawing horse let go,"
517,PART THE FIFTH.,She made a sudden bound:
518,PART THE FIFTH.,"It flung the blood into my head,"
519,PART THE FIFTH.,And I fell down in a swound.
520,PART THE FIFTH.,
521,PART THE FIFTH.,"How long in that same fit I lay,"
522,PART THE FIFTH.,I have not to declare;
523,PART THE FIFTH.,"But ere my living life returned,"
524,PART THE FIFTH.,I heard and in my soul discerned
525,PART THE FIFTH.,Two VOICES in the air.
526,PART THE FIFTH.,
527,PART THE FIFTH.,"""Is it he?"" quoth one, ""Is this the man?"
528,PART THE FIFTH.,"By him who died on cross,"
529,PART THE FIFTH.,"With his cruel bow he laid full low,"
530,PART THE FIFTH.,The harmless Albatross.
531,PART THE FIFTH.,
532,PART THE FIFTH.,"""The spirit who bideth by himself"
533,PART THE FIFTH.,"In the land of mist and snow,"
534,PART THE FIFTH.,He loved the bird that loved the man
535,PART THE FIFTH.,"Who shot him with his bow."""
536,PART THE FIFTH.,
537,PART THE FIFTH.,"The other was a softer voice,"
538,PART THE FIFTH.,As soft as honey-dew:
539,PART THE FIFTH.,"Quoth he, ""The man hath penance done,"
540,PART THE FIFTH.,"And penance more will do."""
541,PART THE FIFTH.,
542,PART THE FIFTH.,
543,PART THE FIFTH.,
544,PART THE FIFTH.,
545,PART THE SIXTH.,PART THE SIXTH.
546,PART THE SIXTH.,
547,PART THE SIXTH.,
548,FIRST VOICE.,FIRST VOICE.
549,FIRST VOICE.,
550,FIRST VOICE.,"But tell me, tell me! speak again,"
551,FIRST VOICE.,Thy soft response renewing--
552,FIRST VOICE.,What makes that ship drive on so fast?
553,FIRST VOICE.,What is the OCEAN doing?
554,FIRST VOICE.,
555,FIRST VOICE.,
556,SECOND VOICE.,SECOND VOICE.
557,SECOND VOICE.,
558,SECOND VOICE.,"Still as a slave before his lord,"
559,SECOND VOICE.,The OCEAN hath no blast;
560,SECOND VOICE.,His great bright eye most silently
561,SECOND VOICE.,Up to the Moon is cast--
562,SECOND VOICE.,
563,SECOND VOICE.,If he may know which way to go;
564,SECOND VOICE.,For she guides him smooth or grim
565,SECOND VOICE.,"See, brother, see! how graciously"
566,SECOND VOICE.,She looketh down on him.
567,SECOND VOICE.,
568,SECOND VOICE.,
569,FIRST VOICE.,FIRST VOICE.
570,FIRST VOICE.,
571,FIRST VOICE.,"But why drives on that ship so fast,"
572,FIRST VOICE.,Without or wave or wind?
573,FIRST VOICE.,
574,FIRST VOICE.,
575,SECOND VOICE.,SECOND VOICE.
576,SECOND VOICE.,
577,SECOND VOICE.,"The air is cut away before,"
578,SECOND VOICE.,And closes from behind.
579,SECOND VOICE.,
580,SECOND VOICE.,"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high"
581,SECOND VOICE.,Or we shall be belated:
582,SECOND VOICE.,"For slow and slow that ship will go,"
583,SECOND VOICE.,When the Mariner's trance is abated.
584,SECOND VOICE.,
585,SECOND VOICE.,"I woke, and we were sailing on"
586,SECOND VOICE.,As in a gentle weather:
587,SECOND VOICE.,"'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high;"
588,SECOND VOICE.,The dead men stood together.
589,SECOND VOICE.,
590,SECOND VOICE.,"All stood together on the deck,"
591,SECOND VOICE.,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
592,SECOND VOICE.,"All fixed on me their stony eyes,"
593,SECOND VOICE.,That in the Moon did glitter.
594,SECOND VOICE.,
595,SECOND VOICE.,"The pang, the curse, with which they died,"
596,SECOND VOICE.,Had never passed away:
597,SECOND VOICE.,"I could not draw my eyes from theirs,"
598,SECOND VOICE.,Nor turn them up to pray.
599,SECOND VOICE.,
600,SECOND VOICE.,And now this spell was snapt: once more
601,SECOND VOICE.,I viewed the ocean green.
602,SECOND VOICE.,"And looked far forth, yet little saw"
603,SECOND VOICE.,Of what had else been seen--
604,SECOND VOICE.,
605,SECOND VOICE.,Like one that on a lonesome road
606,SECOND VOICE.,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
607,SECOND VOICE.,"And having once turned round walks on,"
608,SECOND VOICE.,And turns no more his head;
609,SECOND VOICE.,"Because he knows, a frightful fiend"
610,SECOND VOICE.,Doth close behind him tread.
611,SECOND VOICE.,
612,SECOND VOICE.,"But soon there breathed a wind on me,"
613,SECOND VOICE.,Nor sound nor motion made:
614,SECOND VOICE.,"Its path was not upon the sea,"
615,SECOND VOICE.,In ripple or in shade.
616,SECOND VOICE.,
617,SECOND VOICE.,"It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek"
618,SECOND VOICE.,Like a meadow-gale of spring--
619,SECOND VOICE.,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
620,SECOND VOICE.,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
621,SECOND VOICE.,
622,SECOND VOICE.,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,"
623,SECOND VOICE.,Yet she sailed softly too:
624,SECOND VOICE.,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--"
625,SECOND VOICE.,On me alone it blew.
626,SECOND VOICE.,
627,SECOND VOICE.,Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
628,SECOND VOICE.,The light-house top I see?
629,SECOND VOICE.,Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
630,SECOND VOICE.,Is this mine own countree!
631,SECOND VOICE.,
632,SECOND VOICE.,"We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,"
633,SECOND VOICE.,And I with sobs did pray--
634,SECOND VOICE.,"O let me be awake, my God!"
635,SECOND VOICE.,Or let me sleep alway.
636,SECOND VOICE.,
637,SECOND VOICE.,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,"
638,SECOND VOICE.,So smoothly it was strewn!
639,SECOND VOICE.,"And on the bay the moonlight lay,"
640,SECOND VOICE.,And the shadow of the moon.
641,SECOND VOICE.,
642,SECOND VOICE.,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,"
643,SECOND VOICE.,That stands above the rock:
644,SECOND VOICE.,The moonlight steeped in silentness
645,SECOND VOICE.,The steady weathercock.
646,SECOND VOICE.,
647,SECOND VOICE.,"And the bay was white with silent light,"
648,SECOND VOICE.,"Till rising from the same,"
649,SECOND VOICE.,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
650,SECOND VOICE.,In crimson colours came.
651,SECOND VOICE.,
652,SECOND VOICE.,A little distance from the prow
653,SECOND VOICE.,Those crimson shadows were:
654,SECOND VOICE.,I turned my eyes upon the deck--
655,SECOND VOICE.,"Oh, Christ! what saw I there!"
656,SECOND VOICE.,
657,SECOND VOICE.,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,"
658,SECOND VOICE.,"And, by the holy rood!"
659,SECOND VOICE.,"A man all light, a seraph-man,"
660,SECOND VOICE.,On every corse there stood.
661,SECOND VOICE.,
662,SECOND VOICE.,"This seraph band, each waved his hand:"
663,SECOND VOICE.,It was a heavenly sight!
664,SECOND VOICE.,"They stood as signals to the land,"
665,SECOND VOICE.,Each one a lovely light:
666,SECOND VOICE.,
667,SECOND VOICE.,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand,"
668,SECOND VOICE.,No voice did they impart--
669,SECOND VOICE.,No voice; but oh! the silence sank
670,SECOND VOICE.,Like music on my heart.
671,SECOND VOICE.,
672,SECOND VOICE.,But soon I heard the dash of oars;
673,SECOND VOICE.,I heard the Pilot's cheer;
674,SECOND VOICE.,"My head was turned perforce away,"
675,SECOND VOICE.,And I saw a boat appear.
676,SECOND VOICE.,
677,SECOND VOICE.,"The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy,"
678,SECOND VOICE.,I heard them coming fast:
679,SECOND VOICE.,Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
680,SECOND VOICE.,The dead men could not blast.
681,SECOND VOICE.,
682,SECOND VOICE.,I saw a third--I heard his voice:
683,SECOND VOICE.,It is the Hermit good!
684,SECOND VOICE.,He singeth loud his godly hymns
685,SECOND VOICE.,That he makes in the wood.
686,SECOND VOICE.,"He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away"
687,SECOND VOICE.,The Albatross's blood.
688,SECOND VOICE.,
689,SECOND VOICE.,
690,SECOND VOICE.,
691,SECOND VOICE.,
692,PART THE SEVENTH.,PART THE SEVENTH.
693,PART THE SEVENTH.,
694,PART THE SEVENTH.,This Hermit good lives in that wood
695,PART THE SEVENTH.,Which slopes down to the sea.
696,PART THE SEVENTH.,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
697,PART THE SEVENTH.,He loves to talk with marineres
698,PART THE SEVENTH.,That come from a far countree.
699,PART THE SEVENTH.,
700,PART THE SEVENTH.,He kneels at morn and noon and eve--
701,PART THE SEVENTH.,He hath a cushion plump:
702,PART THE SEVENTH.,It is the moss that wholly hides
703,PART THE SEVENTH.,The rotted old oak-stump.
704,PART THE SEVENTH.,
705,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,"
706,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""Why this is strange, I trow!"
707,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Where are those lights so many and fair,"
708,PART THE SEVENTH.,"That signal made but now?"""
709,PART THE SEVENTH.,
710,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""Strange, by my faith!"" the Hermit said--"
711,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""And they answered not our cheer!"
712,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The planks looked warped! and see those sails,"
713,PART THE SEVENTH.,How thin they are and sere!
714,PART THE SEVENTH.,"I never saw aught like to them,"
715,PART THE SEVENTH.,Unless perchance it were
716,PART THE SEVENTH.,
717,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""Brown skeletons of leaves that lag"
718,PART THE SEVENTH.,My forest-brook along;
719,PART THE SEVENTH.,"When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,"
720,PART THE SEVENTH.,"And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,"
721,PART THE SEVENTH.,"That eats the she-wolf's young."""
722,PART THE SEVENTH.,
723,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--"
724,PART THE SEVENTH.,(The Pilot made reply)
725,PART THE SEVENTH.,"I am a-feared""--""Push on, push on!"""
726,PART THE SEVENTH.,Said the Hermit cheerily.
727,PART THE SEVENTH.,
728,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The boat came closer to the ship,"
729,PART THE SEVENTH.,But I nor spake nor stirred;
730,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The boat came close beneath the ship,"
731,PART THE SEVENTH.,And straight a sound was heard.
732,PART THE SEVENTH.,
733,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Under the water it rumbled on,"
734,PART THE SEVENTH.,Still louder and more dread:
735,PART THE SEVENTH.,"It reached the ship, it split the bay;"
736,PART THE SEVENTH.,The ship went down like lead.
737,PART THE SEVENTH.,
738,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,"
739,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Which sky and ocean smote,"
740,PART THE SEVENTH.,Like one that hath been seven days drowned
741,PART THE SEVENTH.,My body lay afloat;
742,PART THE SEVENTH.,"But swift as dreams, myself I found"
743,PART THE SEVENTH.,Within the Pilot's boat.
744,PART THE SEVENTH.,
745,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,"
746,PART THE SEVENTH.,The boat spun round and round;
747,PART THE SEVENTH.,"And all was still, save that the hill"
748,PART THE SEVENTH.,Was telling of the sound.
749,PART THE SEVENTH.,
750,PART THE SEVENTH.,I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked
751,PART THE SEVENTH.,And fell down in a fit;
752,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The holy Hermit raised his eyes,"
753,PART THE SEVENTH.,And prayed where he did sit.
754,PART THE SEVENTH.,
755,PART THE SEVENTH.,"I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,"
756,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Who now doth crazy go,"
757,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Laughed loud and long, and all the while"
758,PART THE SEVENTH.,His eyes went to and fro.
759,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""Ha! ha!"" quoth he, ""full plain I see,"
760,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The Devil knows how to row."""
761,PART THE SEVENTH.,
762,PART THE SEVENTH.,"And now, all in my own countree,"
763,PART THE SEVENTH.,I stood on the firm land!
764,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,"
765,PART THE SEVENTH.,And scarcely he could stand.
766,PART THE SEVENTH.,
767,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"""
768,PART THE SEVENTH.,The Hermit crossed his brow.
769,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""Say quick,"" quoth he, ""I bid thee say--"
770,PART THE SEVENTH.,"What manner of man art thou?"""
771,PART THE SEVENTH.,
772,PART THE SEVENTH.,Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
773,PART THE SEVENTH.,"With a woeful agony,"
774,PART THE SEVENTH.,Which forced me to begin my tale;
775,PART THE SEVENTH.,And then it left me free.
776,PART THE SEVENTH.,
777,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Since then, at an uncertain hour,"
778,PART THE SEVENTH.,That agony returns;
779,PART THE SEVENTH.,"And till my ghastly tale is told,"
780,PART THE SEVENTH.,This heart within me burns.
781,PART THE SEVENTH.,
782,PART THE SEVENTH.,"I pass, like night, from land to land;"
783,PART THE SEVENTH.,I have strange power of speech;
784,PART THE SEVENTH.,"That moment that his face I see,"
785,PART THE SEVENTH.,I know the man that must hear me:
786,PART THE SEVENTH.,To him my tale I teach.
787,PART THE SEVENTH.,
788,PART THE SEVENTH.,What loud uproar bursts from that door!
789,PART THE SEVENTH.,The wedding-guests are there:
790,PART THE SEVENTH.,But in the garden-bower the bride
791,PART THE SEVENTH.,And bride-maids singing are:
792,PART THE SEVENTH.,"And hark the little vesper bell,"
793,PART THE SEVENTH.,Which biddeth me to prayer!
794,PART THE SEVENTH.,
795,PART THE SEVENTH.,O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been
796,PART THE SEVENTH.,Alone on a wide wide sea:
797,PART THE SEVENTH.,"So lonely 'twas, that God himself"
798,PART THE SEVENTH.,Scarce seemed there to be.
799,PART THE SEVENTH.,
800,PART THE SEVENTH.,"O sweeter than the marriage-feast,"
801,PART THE SEVENTH.,"'Tis sweeter far to me,"
802,PART THE SEVENTH.,To walk together to the kirk
803,PART THE SEVENTH.,With a goodly company!--
804,PART THE SEVENTH.,
805,PART THE SEVENTH.,"To walk together to the kirk,"
806,PART THE SEVENTH.,"And all together pray,"
807,PART THE SEVENTH.,"While each to his great Father bends,"
808,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Old men, and babes, and loving friends,"
809,PART THE SEVENTH.,And youths and maidens gay!
810,PART THE SEVENTH.,
811,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Farewell, farewell! but this I tell"
812,PART THE SEVENTH.,"To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!"
813,PART THE SEVENTH.,"He prayeth well, who loveth well"
814,PART THE SEVENTH.,Both man and bird and beast.
815,PART THE SEVENTH.,
816,PART THE SEVENTH.,"He prayeth best, who loveth best"
817,PART THE SEVENTH.,All things both great and small;
818,PART THE SEVENTH.,For the dear God who loveth us
819,PART THE SEVENTH.,He made and loveth all.
820,PART THE SEVENTH.,
821,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The Mariner, whose eye is bright,"
822,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Whose beard with age is hoar,"
823,PART THE SEVENTH.,Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest
824,PART THE SEVENTH.,Turned from the bridegroom's door.
825,PART THE SEVENTH.,
826,PART THE SEVENTH.,"He went like one that hath been stunned,"
827,PART THE SEVENTH.,And is of sense forlorn:
828,PART THE SEVENTH.,"A sadder and a wiser man,"
829,PART THE SEVENTH.,He rose the morrow morn.
830,PART THE SEVENTH.,
831,PART THE SEVENTH.,
832,PART THE SEVENTH.,
833,PART THE SEVENTH.,
834,PART THE SEVENTH.,
835,PART THE SEVENTH.,
836,PART THE SEVENTH.,
