61,CAMBRIDGE.,_Spring saw my little venture just begun;
62,CAMBRIDGE.,"And then your hospitable message came,"
63,CAMBRIDGE.,Inviting me to taste the strawberries
64,CAMBRIDGE.,"At Strawberry Hill. I went. How long I stayed,"
65,CAMBRIDGE.,"Urged by dear friends and the restoring breeze,"
66,CAMBRIDGE.,Let me not say; long enough to complete
67,CAMBRIDGE.,"My rhythmic structure; day by day it grew,"
68,CAMBRIDGE.,And all sweet influences helped its growth.
69,CAMBRIDGE.,The lawn sloped green and ample till the trees
70,CAMBRIDGE.,Met on its margin; and the Hudson's tide
71,CAMBRIDGE.,"Rolled beautiful beyond, where purple gleams"
72,CAMBRIDGE.,Fell on the Palisades or touched the hills
73,CAMBRIDGE.,Of the opposing shore; for all without
74,CAMBRIDGE.,Was but an emblem of the symmetry
75,CAMBRIDGE.,"I found within, where love held perfect sway,"
76,CAMBRIDGE.,With taste and beauty and domestic peace
77,CAMBRIDGE.,For its allies._
78,CAMBRIDGE.,
79,CAMBRIDGE.,"_We do not praise the rose,"
80,CAMBRIDGE.,Since all who see it know it is the rose;
81,CAMBRIDGE.,"And so, dear lady, praise of thee would seem,"
82,CAMBRIDGE.,"To all who know thee, quite superfluous."
83,CAMBRIDGE.,But if from any of these thoughts be shed
84,CAMBRIDGE.,"Aught of the fragrance and the hue of truth,"
85,CAMBRIDGE.,To thee I dedicate the transient flower
86,CAMBRIDGE.,In which the eternal beauty reappears;
87,CAMBRIDGE.,"Knowing, should poison mingle with the sweet,"
88,CAMBRIDGE.,"Thou, like the eclectic bee, with instinct sure,"
89,CAMBRIDGE.,"Wilt take the good alone, and leave the bad._"

144,OVERTURE.,"Blest Power that canst transfigure common things,"
145,OVERTURE.,"And, like the sun, make the clod burst in bloom,--"
146,OVERTURE.,"Unseal the fount so mute this many a day,"
147,OVERTURE.,"And help me sing of Linda! Why of her,"
148,OVERTURE.,"Since she would shrink with manifest recoil,"
149,OVERTURE.,Knew she that deeds of hers were made a theme
150,OVERTURE.,For measured verse? Why leave the garden flowers
151,OVERTURE.,To fix the eye on one poor violet
152,OVERTURE.,That on the solitary grove sheds fragrance?
153,OVERTURE.,"Themes are enough, that court a wide regard,"
154,OVERTURE.,"And prompt a strenuous flight; and yet from all,"
155,OVERTURE.,"My thoughts come back to Linda. Let me spare,"
156,OVERTURE.,"As best I may, her modest privacy,"
157,OVERTURE.,While under Fancy's not inapt disguise
158,OVERTURE.,"I give substantial truth, and deal with no"
159,OVERTURE.,Unreal beings or fantastic facts:
160,OVERTURE.,"Bear witness to it, Linda!"
161,OVERTURE.,
162,OVERTURE.,Now while May
163,OVERTURE.,"Keeps me a restive prisoner in the house,"
164,OVERTURE.,For the first time the Spring's unkindness ever
165,OVERTURE.,"Held me aloof from her companionship,"
166,OVERTURE.,However roughly from the east her breath
167,OVERTURE.,Came as if all the icebergs of Grand Bank
168,OVERTURE.,"Were giving up their forms in that one gust,--"
169,OVERTURE.,Now while on orchard-trees the struggling blossoms
170,OVERTURE.,"Break from the varnished cerements, and in clouds"
171,OVERTURE.,Of pink and white float round the boughs that hold
172,OVERTURE.,"Their verdure yet in check,--and while the lawn"
173,OVERTURE.,"Lures from yon hemlock hedge the robin, plump"
174,OVERTURE.,"And copper-breasted, and the west wind brings"
175,OVERTURE.,"Mildness and balm,--let me attempt the task"
176,OVERTURE.,That also is a pastime.
177,OVERTURE.,
178,OVERTURE.,What though Spring
179,OVERTURE.,Brings not of Youth the wonder and the zest;
180,OVERTURE.,"The hopes, the day-dreams, and the exultations?"
181,OVERTURE.,The animal life whose overflow and waste
182,OVERTURE.,Would far out-measure now our little hoard?
183,OVERTURE.,The health that made mere physical existence
184,OVERTURE.,An ample joy; that on the ocean beach
185,OVERTURE.,Shared with the leaping waves their breezy glee;
186,OVERTURE.,"That in deep woods, or in forsaken clearings,"
187,OVERTURE.,"Where the charred logs were hid by verdure new,"
188,OVERTURE.,And the shy wood-thrush lighted; or on hills
189,OVERTURE.,Whence counties lay outspread beneath our gaze;
190,OVERTURE.,Or by some rock-girt lake where sandy margins
191,OVERTURE.,"Sloped to the mirrored tints of waving trees,--"
192,OVERTURE.,"Could feel no burden in the grasshopper,"
193,OVERTURE.,And no unrest in the long summer day?
194,OVERTURE.,Would I esteem Youth's fervors fair return
195,OVERTURE.,For temperate airs that fan sublimer heights
196,OVERTURE.,Than Youth could scale; heights whence the patient vision
197,OVERTURE.,"May see this life's harsh inequalities,"
198,OVERTURE.,"Its rudimental good and full-blown evil,"
199,OVERTURE.,"Its crimes and earthquakes and insanities,"
200,OVERTURE.,"And all the wrongs and sorrows that perplex us,"
201,OVERTURE.,"Assume, beneath the eternal calm, the order"
202,OVERTURE.,Which can come only from a Love Divine?
203,OVERTURE.,"A love that sees the good beyond the evil,"
204,OVERTURE.,"The serial life beyond the eclipsing death,--"
205,OVERTURE.,"That tracks the spirit through eternities,"
206,OVERTURE.,"Backward and forward, and in every germ"
207,OVERTURE.,"Beholds its past, its present, and its future,"
208,OVERTURE.,At every stage beholds it gravitate
209,OVERTURE.,"Where it belongs, and thence new-born emerge"
210,OVERTURE.,"Into new life and opportunity,"
211,OVERTURE.,"An outcast never from the assiduous Mercy,"
212,OVERTURE.,"Providing for His teeming universe,"
213,OVERTURE.,"Divinely perfect not because complete,"
214,OVERTURE.,"But because incomplete, advancing ever"
215,OVERTURE.,"Beneath the care Supreme?--heights whence the soul,"
216,OVERTURE.,"Uplifted from all speculative fog,"
217,OVERTURE.,"All darkening doctrine, all confusing fear,"
218,OVERTURE.,"Can see the drifted plants, can scent the odors,"
219,OVERTURE.,That surely come from that celestial shore
220,OVERTURE.,"To which we tend; however out of reckoning,"
221,OVERTURE.,"Swept wrong by Error's currents, Passion's storms,"
222,OVERTURE.,The poor tossed bark may be?
223,OVERTURE.,
224,OVERTURE.,"Descend, my thoughts!"
225,OVERTURE.,Your theme lies lowly as the ground-bird's nest;
226,OVERTURE.,"Why seek, with wings so feeble and unused,"
227,OVERTURE.,To soar above the clouds and front the stars?
228,OVERTURE.,"Descend from your high venture, and to scenes"
229,OVERTURE.,Of the heart's common history come down!

236,THE FATHER'S STORY.,THE FATHER'S STORY.
237,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
238,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
239,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The little mansion had its fill of sunshine;
240,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The western windows overlooked the Hudson
241,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Where the great city's traffic vexed the tide;
242,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The front received the Orient's early flush.
243,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Here dwelt three beings, who the neighbors said"
244,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Were husband, wife, and daughter; and indeed"
245,THE FATHER'S STORY.,There was no sign that they were otherwise.
246,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Their name was Percival; they lived secluded,"
247,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Saw no society, except some poor"
248,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Old pensioner who came for food or help;
249,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Though, when fair days invited, they would take"
250,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The omnibus and go to see the paintings
251,THE FATHER'S STORY.,At the Academy; or hear the music
252,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"At opera or concert; then, in summer,"
253,THE FATHER'S STORY.,A visit to the seaside or the hills
254,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Would oft entice them.
255,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
256,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Percival had reached
257,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"His threescore years and five, but stood erect"
258,THE FATHER'S STORY.,As if no touch of age had chilled him yet.
259,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Simple in habit, studious how to live"
260,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In best conformity with laws divine,--"
261,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Impulsive, yet by trial taught to question"
262,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"All impulses, affections, appetites,"
263,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"At Reason's bar,--two objects paramount"
264,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Seemed steadily before him; one, to find"
265,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"The eternal truth, showing the constant right"
266,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In politics, in social life, in morals,--"
267,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"The other, to apply all love and wisdom"
268,THE FATHER'S STORY.,To education of his child--of Linda.
269,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
270,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Yet, if with eye anointed, you could look"
271,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"On that benign and tranquil countenance,"
272,THE FATHER'S STORY.,You might detect the lines which Passion leaves
273,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Long after its volcano is extinct
274,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And flowers conceal its lava. Percival
275,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Was older than his consort, twenty years;"
276,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Yet were they fitly mated; though, with her,"
277,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Time had dealt very gently, leaving face"
278,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And rounded form still youthful, and unmarred"
279,THE FATHER'S STORY.,By one uncomely outline; hardly mingling
280,THE FATHER'S STORY.,A thread of silver in her chestnut hair
281,THE FATHER'S STORY.,That affluent needed no deceiving braid.
282,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Framed for maternity the matron seemed:
283,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Thrice had she been a mother; but the children,"
284,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"The first six winters of her union brought,"
285,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"A boy and girl, were lost to her at once"
286,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"By a wall's falling on them, as they went,"
287,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Heedless of danger, hand in hand, to school."
288,THE FATHER'S STORY.,To either parent terrible the blow!
289,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"But, three years afterward, when Linda came,"
290,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"With her dark azure eyes and golden hair,"
291,THE FATHER'S STORY.,It was as if a healing angel touched
292,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"The parents' wound, and turned their desolation"
293,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Into a present paradise, revealing"
294,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Two dear ones, beckoning from the spirit-land,"
295,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And one, detaining them, with infant grasp,"
296,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Feeble, yet how resistless! here below."
297,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
298,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And so there was great comfort in that household:
299,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And those unwhispered longings both had felt
300,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"At times, that they might pass to other scenes"
301,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Where Love would find its own, were felt no more:"
302,THE FATHER'S STORY.,For Linda grew in beauty every day;
303,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Beauty not only of the outward mould,"
304,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Sparkling in those dear eyes, and on the wind"
305,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Tossing those locks of gold, but beauty born,"
306,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In revelations flitting o'er the face,"
307,THE FATHER'S STORY.,From the soul's inner symmetry; from love
308,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Too deep and pure to utter, had she words;"
309,THE FATHER'S STORY.,From the divine desire to know; to prove
310,THE FATHER'S STORY.,All objects brought within her dawning ken;
311,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"From frolic mirth, not heedless but most apt;"
312,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"From sense of conscience, shown in little things"
313,THE FATHER'S STORY.,So early; and from infant courtesy
314,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Charming and debonair.
315,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
316,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"The parents said,"
317,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"While the glad tears shone brimming in their eyes,"
318,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Oh! lacking love and best experience"
319,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Are those who tell us that the purity
320,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And innocence of childhood are delusion;
321,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Or that, so far as they exist, they show"
322,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The absence of all mind; no impulses
323,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Save those of selfish passion moving it!
324,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And that, by nature desperately wicked,[1]"
325,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The child learns good through evil; having no
326,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Innate ideas, no inborn will, no bias."
327,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Here, in this infant, is our confutation!"
328,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"O self-sufficing physiologist,"
329,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Who, grubbing in the earth, hast missed the stars,"
330,THE FATHER'S STORY.,We ask no other answer to thy creed
331,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Than this, the answer heaven and earth supply."""
332,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
333,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Now sixteen summers had our Linda seen,"
334,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And grown to be a fair-haired, winsome maid,"
335,THE FATHER'S STORY.,In shape and aspect promising to be
336,THE FATHER'S STORY.,A softened repetition of her mother;
337,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And yet some traits from the paternal side
338,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Gave to the head an intellectual grace
339,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And to the liquid eyes a power reserved,"
340,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Brooding awhile in tender gloom, and then"
341,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Flashing emotion, as some lofty thought,"
342,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Some sight of pity, or some generous deed,"
343,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Kindled a ready sympathy whose tears
344,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Fell on no barren purpose; for with Linda
345,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"To feel, to be uplifted, was to act;"
346,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Her sorest trials being when she found
347,THE FATHER'S STORY.,How far the wish to do outran the power.
348,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Often would Percival observe his child,"
349,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And study to divine if in the future
350,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Of that organization, when mature,"
351,THE FATHER'S STORY.,There should prevail the elements that lead
352,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Woman to find the crowning charm of life
353,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In the affections of a happy marriage,"
354,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Or if with satisfactions of the mind
355,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And the æsthetic faculty, the aims"
356,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Of art and letters, the pursuits of trade,"
357,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Linda might find the fresh activities
358,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"He craved for her, and which forecasting care"
359,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Might possibly provide.
360,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
361,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"His means were small,"
362,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Merged in a life-annuity which gave
363,THE FATHER'S STORY.,All that he held as indispensable
364,THE FATHER'S STORY.,To sanative conditions in a home:
365,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Good air, good influences, proper food."
366,THE FATHER'S STORY.,By making his old wardrobe do long service
367,THE FATHER'S STORY.,He saved the wherewith to get faithful help
368,THE FATHER'S STORY.,From the best teachers in instructing Linda;
369,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And she was still the object uppermost.
370,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Dawned the day fair, for Linda it was fair,"
371,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And they all three could ramble in the Park.
372,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"If on Broadway the ripe fruit tempted him,"
373,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Linda was fond of fruit; those grapes will do
374,THE FATHER'S STORY.,For Linda. Was the music rich and rare?
375,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Linda must hear it. Were the paintings grand?
376,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Linda must see them. So the important thought
377,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Was always Linda; and the mother shared
378,THE FATHER'S STORY.,In all this fond parental providence;
379,THE FATHER'S STORY.,For in her tender pride in the dear girl
380,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"There was no room for any selfish thought,"
381,THE FATHER'S STORY.,For any jealous balancing of dues.
382,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
383,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""My child,"" said Percival, one summer day,"
384,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"As he brought in a bunch of snow-white roses,"
385,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Ringed with carnations, many-leafed and fragrant,"
386,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Take it, an offering for your birthday; this"
387,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Is June the twelfth, a happy day for me."""
388,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""How fresh, how beautiful!"" said Linda rising"
389,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And kissing him on either cheek.  ""Dear father,"
390,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"You spoil me for all other care, I fear,"
391,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Since none can be like yours."""
392,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
393,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Why speak of that?"""
394,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"He with a start exclaimed; ""my care must be"
395,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Prolonged till I can see you safely fixed
396,THE FATHER'S STORY.,In an assured and happy womanhood.
397,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Why should it not be so? Though sixty-five,"
398,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"How well am I, and strong! No, Linda, no;"
399,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Dream not of other tendance yet awhile;
400,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"My father lived to eighty, and his father"
401,THE FATHER'S STORY.,To eighty-five; and I am stronger now
402,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Than they were, at my age."""
403,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
404,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Live long!"" cried Linda,"
405,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""For whom have I to love me, to befriend,"
406,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"You and my mother gone?"""
407,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
408,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Your mother, child?"
409,THE FATHER'S STORY.,She should outlive me by some twenty years
410,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"At least. God grant, her sweet companionship"
411,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"May be your strength and light when I'm not here,"
412,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"My matchless little girl, my precious Linda!"""
413,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
414,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Ah! how Love magnifies the thing it loves!"""
415,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Smiling she said: ""when I look in the glass,"
416,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"I see a comely Miss; nay, perhaps pretty;"
417,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"That epithet is her superlative,"
418,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"So far as person is concerned, I fear."
419,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Grant her a cheerful temper; that she gets
420,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"From both her parents. She is dutiful,--"
421,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"No wonder, for she never is opposed!"
422,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Strangely coincident her way is yours;
423,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Industrious, but that's her mother's training."
424,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Then if you come to gifts of mind--ah me!
425,THE FATHER'S STORY.,What can she show? We'll not pronounce her dull;
426,THE FATHER'S STORY.,But she's not apt or quick; and all she gets
427,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Is by hard work, by oft-repeated trials,"
428,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Trials with intermissions of despair.
429,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The languages she takes to not unkindly;
430,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"But mathematics is her scourge, her kill-joy,"
431,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Pressing her like a nightmare. Logic, too,"
432,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Distresses and confuses her poor brain;
433,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Oh! ask her not for reasons. As for music--
434,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Music she loves. Would that Love might inspire
435,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The genius it reveres so ardently!
436,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Has she no gift for painting? Eye for form
437,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And coloring I truly think she has;
438,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And one thing she can do, and do it well;"
439,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"She can group flowers and ferns and autumn leaves,"
440,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Paint their true tints, and render back to nature"
441,THE FATHER'S STORY.,A not unfaithful copy.
442,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
443,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""This the extent"
444,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Of her achievements! She has labored hard
445,THE FATHER'S STORY.,To mould a bust or statue; but the clay
446,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Lacked the Pygmalion touch beneath her hands.
447,THE FATHER'S STORY.,She'll never be a female Angelo.
448,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"She must come down content to mother Earth,"
449,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And study out the alphabet which Summer
450,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Weaves on the sod in fields or bordering woods.
451,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Such is your paragon, my simple father!"
452,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"But now, this ordinary little girl,"
453,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"So seeming frank, (whisper it low!) is yet"
454,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"So deep, so crafty, and so full of wiles,"
455,THE FATHER'S STORY.,That she has quite persuaded both her parents--
456,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In most things sensible, clear-seeing people--"
457,THE FATHER'S STORY.,That she is just a prodigy indeed!
458,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Not one of goodness merely, but of wit,"
459,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Capacity, and general cleverness!"""
460,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
461,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""There, that will do, spoilt darling! What a tongue!"""
462,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Percival said, admiring while he chided."
463,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""O the swift time! Thou'rt seventeen to-day;"
464,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And yet, except thy parents and thy teachers,"
465,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Friends and companions thou hast hardly known.
466,THE FATHER'S STORY.,'Tis fit that I should tell thee why our life
467,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Has been thus socially estranged and quiet.
468,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Sit down, and let me push the arm-chair up"
469,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Where I can note the changes in thy face;
470,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"For 'tis a traitor, that sweet face of thine,"
471,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And has a sign for every fleeting thought.
472,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
473,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""But here's our little mother! Come, my dear,"
474,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And take a seat by Linda; thou didst help me
475,THE FATHER'S STORY.,To graft upon the bitter past a fruit
476,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"All sweetness, and thy very presence now"
477,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Can take the sting from a too sad remembrance."""
478,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
479,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The mother placed her hand upon his brow
480,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And said: ""The water-lily springs from mud;"
481,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"So springs the future from the past."" Then he:"
482,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""My father's death made me, at twenty-one,"
483,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Heir to a fortune which in those slow days
484,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Was thought sufficient: I had quitted Yale
485,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"With some slight reputation as a scholar,"
486,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And, in the first flush of ingenuous youth"
487,THE FATHER'S STORY.,When brave imagination's rosy hue
488,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Tinges all unknown objects, I was launched"
489,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Into society in this great place;--
490,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Sisterless, motherless, and having seen"
491,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"But little, in my student life, of women."
492,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
493,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""All matrons who had marriageable girls"
494,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Looked on me as their proper prey, and spread"
495,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Their nets to catch me; and, poor, verdant youth,"
496,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Soon I was caught,--caught in a snare indeed,"
497,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Though by no mother's clever management.
498,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Young, beautiful, accomplished, she, my Fate,"
499,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Met me with smiles, and doomed me while she smiled"
500,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Nimble as light, fluent as molten lead"
501,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"To take the offered mould,--apt to affect"
502,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Each preference of taste or sentiment
503,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"That best might flatter,--affable and kind,"
504,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Or seeming so,--and generous to a fault,--"
505,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"But that was when she had a part to play,--"
506,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Affectionate--ah! there too she was feigning--
507,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"As I look calmly back, to me she seems"
508,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The simple incarnation of a mind
509,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Possessed of all the secrets of the heart,"
510,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And quick to substitute a counterfeit
511,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"For the heart's genuine coin, and make it pass;"
512,THE FATHER'S STORY.,But void of feeling as the knife that wounds!
513,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And so the game was in her hands, and she"
514,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Played it with confident, remorseless skill"
515,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Even to the bitter end.
516,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
517,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Yet do not think"
518,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The inner prescience never stirred or spoke:
519,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Veiled though it be from consciousness so strangely,"
520,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And its fine voice unheard amid the din
521,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Of outward things, the quest of earthly passion,"
522,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"There is an under-sense, a faculty"
523,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"All independent of our mortal organs,"
524,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And circumscribed by neither space nor time.
525,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Else whence proceed they, those clairvoyant glimpses,"
526,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"That vision piercing to the distant future,"
527,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Those quick monitions of impending ruin,"
528,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"If not from depths of soul which consciousness,"
529,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Limited as it is in mortal scope,"
530,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"May not explore? Yet there serenely latent,"
531,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Or with a conscious being all their own,"
532,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Superior and apart from what we know
533,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In this close keep we call our waking state,"
534,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Lie growing with our growth the lofty powers
535,THE FATHER'S STORY.,We reck not of; which some may live a life
536,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And never heed, nor know they have a soul;"
537,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Which many a plodding anthropologist,"
538,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Philosopher, logician, scientist,"
539,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Ignore as moonshine; but which are, no less,"
540,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Actual, proven, and, in their dignity"
541,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And grasp and space-defying attributes,"
542,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Worthy to qualify a deathless spirit
543,THE FATHER'S STORY.,To have the range of an infinity
544,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Through an unending period--at once
545,THE FATHER'S STORY.,A promise and a proof of life immortal.
546,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
547,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""One night, one mild, sweet night in early June,"
548,THE FATHER'S STORY.,We two had paced the drawing-room together
549,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Till ten o'clock, and then I took my leave"
550,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And walked along the street, a square or more,"
551,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"When suddenly I looked up at a star,"
552,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And then, a thought I could not fail to heed,"
553,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"From the soul's awful region unexplored,"
554,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Rushed, crying, 'Back! Go back!' And back I went,"
555,THE FATHER'S STORY.,As hastily as if it were a thing
556,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Of life or death. I did not stop to pull
557,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"The door-bell, but sprang up alert and still"
558,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"To the piazza of the open window,"
559,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Drew back a blind inaudibly, looked in,"
560,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And through the waving muslin curtain, saw--"
561,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Well, she was seated in a young man's lap,"
562,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Her head upon his shoulder.
563,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
564,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Quick of ear"
565,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"As the chased hare, she heard me; started up,"
566,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Ran to the curtain, eagerly drew me in,"
567,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And said, while joy beamed tender in her eyes,"
568,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'My brother Ambrose, just arrived from Europe!'"
569,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"So swift she was, she did not give me time"
570,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Even for one jealous pang. I took his hand,"
571,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And saying, 'Anna's brother must be mine,'"
572,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"I bade them both good-night, and went my way:"
573,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"So was I fooled,--my better angel baffled!"
574,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
575,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""And yet once more the vivid warning came,"
576,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Flashed like quick truth from her own eyes. We stood
577,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Together in a ball-room, when a lady,"
578,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"To me unknown, came up, regarded me"
579,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"With strange compassion in her curious glance,"
580,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And then, with something less divine than pity,"
581,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Looked down on my betrothed, and moved away."
582,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"I turned to Anna, but upon her face,"
583,THE FATHER'S STORY.,There was a look to startle like a ghost;
584,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Defiance, deadly fear, and murderous hate"
585,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Were all so wildly blended! But 'twas gone--
586,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Gone like a flash before I well could mark it;
587,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And in its place there came a luminous smile,"
588,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"So childlike sweet, such type of heavenly candor,"
589,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"It would have served for a Madonna's mouth,"
590,THE FATHER'S STORY.,To make the pilgrim's adoration easy.
591,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'Who was that lady, Anna?' I inquired."
592,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'A Mrs. Lothian,' was her reply:"
593,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'A lovely person, although somewhat haughty.'"
594,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"We returned home soon after, and no more"
595,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Was said of it.
596,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
597,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""The rapid weeks flew by,"
598,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And Anna plied her powers to charm, but still"
599,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Not all the subtle glamour of her presence
600,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Could bind in sleep my pleading monitor.
601,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And so at last I said: 'We both are young:
602,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Let us, as earnest of a mutual wish"
603,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"To share a perfect love, or none at all,"
604,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Absolve each other here, without condition,"
605,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"From this engagement; and, if three years hence"
606,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"We both are of one heart, then shall we find"
607,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The means to make it known; of that be sure!
608,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Are you in your own loyalty so fixed
609,THE FATHER'S STORY.,As to accept the challenge? Would you prize
610,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"The love of any man, who could not bear"
611,THE FATHER'S STORY.,A test so simple?'
612,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
613,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""The first word I spoke"
614,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Made all my meaning plain to her; she shook,"
615,THE FATHER'S STORY.,But more perhaps with anger than with grief;
616,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"She turned her face away, and covered it"
617,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"With both her hands, and so remained until"
618,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"I had done speaking; then she rose at once,"
619,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Her face averted still, (she durst not show it!)"
620,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And grasped my hand, and, in a husky tone"
621,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Sheathing her wrath, exclaimed: 'To-morrow, come"
622,THE FATHER'S STORY.,At twelve--at twelve!' and rushed out of the room.
623,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
624,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Prompt at the hour I went; and in the parlor"
625,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Sat down expectant; and she entered soon,"
626,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Clad all in white; upon her face the marks
627,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Of passionate tears, and a beseeching sorrow"
628,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In every look! A desk of ivory,"
629,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Borne in her hands, she placed upon the table;"
630,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"I rose to meet her, but she motioned me"
631,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"To keep my seat; then, with an arm thrown over"
632,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"A high-backed chair, as if to keep from falling,"
633,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"(The attitude was charming, and she knew it),"
634,THE FATHER'S STORY.,She said: 'Take back the little desk you gave me;
635,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In it are all your letters,--all your gifts."
636,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Take them, and give me mine.'"
637,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
638,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""The last few words"
639,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Came as if struggling through a crowd of sobs.
640,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"What could I do but lead her to the sofa,"
641,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Sit by her side, take her white hand, and say:"
642,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'This is no final separation, Anna;"
643,THE FATHER'S STORY.,It is a trial merely of our loves?'
644,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
645,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""'A light affair perhaps to you,' she said,"
646,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'But death to me. As whim or pleasure points,"
647,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"You can go here, go there, and lead the life"
648,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"You most affect; while I, the home-kept slave"
649,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Of others' humors, must brave poverty,"
650,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Neglect and cruel treatment.'--'Did you say
651,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Poverty, Anna?'--'Do not breathe a word"
652,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Of what I tell you: father is a bankrupt,"
653,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Or soon will be; and we shall be compelled
654,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"To quit our freestone house, and breathe the air"
655,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Of squalid want. From that I'd not recoil,"
656,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Could I have loving looks and words; for what
657,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Is poverty if there's but love to gild it?
658,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Ah! poverty'--'Nay, Anna, poverty"
659,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"You shall not know, only accept from me"
660,THE FATHER'S STORY.,The means to fix you in becoming plenty.'
661,THE FATHER'S STORY.,'Never!' she cried; 'ah! cruel to propose it!'
662,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And then more tears; till, touched and foiled, I said,"
663,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Looking her in the face while she gazed up
664,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In mine with eager tenderness,--'Accept"
665,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"A happy home, if I can help to make it."
666,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"We will be married, Anna, when you please.'"
667,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
668,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""And so she had her way, and we were married;"
669,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And the next day all Wall Street was aroused
670,THE FATHER'S STORY.,By news that brave Papa had won renown
671,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Not simply as a bankrupt, but a swindler,"
672,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Escaping, by the skin of his teeth, the Tombs."
673,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'No matter! Papa has a son-in-law,"
674,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"A greenhorn, as they say, who occupies"
675,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"A stately house on the Fifth Avenue,"
676,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And, in his hall, Papa will hang his hat.'"
677,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And, in all this, Rumor but hit the truth."
678,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
679,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Six months rolled by. Repeatedly I asked,"
680,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'Where's Brother Ambrose?' He, it seems, was held"
681,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In such request by government, that rarely"
682,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Could he be spared for home enjoyment; but
683,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"At length I did encounter Brother Ambrose,"
684,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And once again I found him--
685,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
686,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Well, the scales"
687,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Dropped from my eyes. I asked no other proof
688,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Than a quick look I saw the two exchange,--"
689,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Forgetful of a mirror at their side,--"
690,THE FATHER'S STORY.,To see I was betrayed. He was no brother.
691,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"I sought more proof; but they, imagining"
692,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"I knew more than I did, were swift to act."
693,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Before I could find steps for a divorce
694,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"She stole a march upon me, and herself"
695,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Took the initiative, and played the victim,"
696,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Nipping me as a culprit in the law.
697,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
698,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""It was a plot so dexterously framed,"
699,THE FATHER'S STORY.,All the precautions and contrivances
700,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Were with such craft foreplanned; the perjuries
701,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Were all so well adjusted; my pure life
702,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Was made to seem so black; the witnesses
703,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Were so well drilled, so perfect in their parts,--"
704,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"In short, it was a work of art so thorough,"
705,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"I did not marvel at the Court's decision,"
706,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Which was, for her,--divorce and alimony;"
707,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"For me,--no freedom, since no privilege"
708,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Of marrying again. Such the decree!"""
709,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
710,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""I'm glad you spurned it as you did!"" cried Linda,"
711,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"While her cheeks flushed, and hot, indignant tears,"
712,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Responded to her anger. Then she kissed
713,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Her father on each cheek, and tenderly"
714,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Embraced her mother too; and they, the while,"
715,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"With a slight moisture in their smiling eyes,"
716,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Exchanged a nod. Then Percival to Linda:
717,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""Why, what an utter rebel you would be,"
718,THE FATHER'S STORY.,You little champion of the higher law!
719,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Sit down, and hear me out."""
720,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
721,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""If such their justice,"""

727,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""My little girl,"""

729,THE FATHER'S STORY.,May guide us safely when the act must be
730,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Born of the instant, but let Reason rule"
731,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"When Reason may. For some twelve years, I lived"
732,THE FATHER'S STORY.,A wandering life in Europe; not so crushed
733,THE FATHER'S STORY.,By my most harsh experience but I
734,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Could find, in study and in change of scene,"
735,THE FATHER'S STORY.,How much of relish life has for the mind
736,THE FATHER'S STORY.,As well as the affections; still I felt
737,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Mine was a nature in which these must play
738,THE FATHER'S STORY.,No secondary part; and so the void
739,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Enlarged as age drew nearer; and at forty
740,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"A weariness of life came over me,"
741,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And I was sick at heart; for many a joy
742,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Had lost the charm that made it joy. I took
743,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"A house in London, all for solitude,"
744,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And there got what you may not find in Egypt,"
745,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Or on Mont Blanc.

747,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""One day as I was crossing"
748,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"An obscure street, I saw a crowd of workmen"
749,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Gathered around a man upon the ground:
750,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"A rafter from a half-built house had fallen,"
751,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And he was badly injured. Seeing none
752,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"To act with promptness in the case, I hailed"
753,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"A cab, and had him driven to my house."
754,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Finding he was a fellow-countryman,"
755,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"I gave him one of my spare rooms, and sent"
756,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"For the best surgeon near. His report was,"
757,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"The wound itself was nothing serious,"
758,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"But there was over-action of the brain,"
759,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Quite independent, which might lead to danger,"
760,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Unless reduced in season; and the patient
761,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Should have the best of watching and attendance,"
762,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And not be left to brood on any trouble,"
763,THE FATHER'S STORY.,But be kept cheerful. Then with some directions
764,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"For diet, sedatives, and laxatives,"
765,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"The doctor bowed, received his fee, and left."
766,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"My guest lay sad and silent for a while,"
767,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Then turned to me and said: 'My name is Kenrick;

777,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'How strange,' said I, 'the inconsistency!"
778,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Here's a true man would try to overtake
779,THE FATHER'S STORY.,An untrue mate! If she's not sterling gold

782,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Why should you care who puts her to the proof,"
783,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Takes her away, and leaves you free again?"
784,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Show me 'tis an illusion I adore,"
785,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"And I will thank you, though it be in anguish."

796,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Of the poor runaway?'--'Ay, that I have!"

798,THE FATHER'S STORY.,
799,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"""'Jealousy and love"
800,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Were never yet true mates; for jealousy
801,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Is born of selfish passion, lust, or pride,"
802,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"While love is so divine and pure a thing,"
803,THE FATHER'S STORY.,It only takes what cannot be withheld.
804,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"It flies constraint. All that it gives is given,"
805,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Even as the lily renders up its perfume,"
806,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Because it cannot help it. Would it crave
807,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Return less worthy? Would it be content
808,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"With a grudged gift? Then it is something else,"
809,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Not love--not love! Ah me! how men and women

816,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'Speak this to me again, when I am stronger,'"
817,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Said Kenrick, smiling faintly. Then I left him,"
818,THE FATHER'S STORY.,And taking up 'The Times' looked thro' the list
819,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Of 'Wants'; and one amid the many hundred
820,THE FATHER'S STORY.,Instantly caught my eye. It merely said:
821,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"'Wanted, by a young woman, strong and healthy,"
822,THE FATHER'S STORY.,A place as nurse for any invalid.
823,THE FATHER'S STORY.,"Address 681, Times Office.' So"

945,IV.,"Tell it."" She answered: ""Let it be so, then;"
946,IV.,"My life is but the affluent to yours,"
947,IV.,In which it found its amplitude and rest.
948,IV.,
949,IV.,"""My parents dwelt in Liverpool; my father,"
950,IV.,"A prosperous merchant, gave to business"
951,IV.,"His time and active thoughts, and let his wife"

953,IV.,My maiden name was Mary Merivale.
954,IV.,"There were eight daughters of us, and of these"
955,IV.,"I was the fourth. We lived in liberal style,"
956,IV.,And did not lack the best society
957,IV.,"The city could afford. My heedful mother,"
958,IV.,"With eight undowered girls to be disposed of,"
959,IV.,"Fearfully healthy all, and clamorous"
960,IV.,"For clothes and rations, entered on a plan"
961,IV.,"To which she steadily adhered: it was,"
962,IV.,"To send the younger fry to boarding-schools,"
963,IV.,"And keep one virgin only, at a time,"
964,IV.,"And she the oldest, on her hands to marry."
965,IV.,"So they came forward in their order: Julia,"
966,IV.,"And Isabel, and Caroline; until"
967,IV.,"I was dragged forth from maps and lexicons,"
968,IV.,"Slate-pencils and arithmetics, and put"
969,IV.,"Candidate Number Four, upon the list."
970,IV.,
971,IV.,"""My elder sisters had been all 'well-married';"
972,IV.,"That is, to parties able to provide"
973,IV.,Establishments that Fashion would not scorn;
974,IV.,What more could be desired by loving parents?
975,IV.,"As for resistance to her will, when once"
976,IV.,"She set her heart upon a match, my mother"
977,IV.,Would no more bear it than a general
978,IV.,Would bear demur from a subordinate
979,IV.,"When ordered into action. If a daughter,"
980,IV.,"When her chance offered, and was checked as good,"
981,IV.,"Presumed, from any scruple of dislike,"
982,IV.,"To block the way for her successor, then"
983,IV.,"Woe to that daughter, and no peace for her"
984,IV.,"Did she not, with an utter selfishness,"
985,IV.,Stand in her younger sister's light? imperil
986,IV.,The poor child's welfare? doom her possibly
987,IV.,To an old maid's forlorn and cheerless lot?
988,IV.,
989,IV.,"""And so, with an imperious will, my mother"
990,IV.,"Would sweep away all hindrances, all doubts."
991,IV.,"She was, besides, the slave of system; having"
992,IV.,Adopted once the plan of bringing forward
993,IV.,"No daughter till the previous one was mated,"
994,IV.,It was a sacred custom; 'twas her own!
995,IV.,It had worked well; must not be broken through.
996,IV.,So my poor sisters went; and some of them
997,IV.,With doubting hearts.
998,IV.,
999,IV.,"""In me, my zealous mother"
1000,IV.,Found metal not so malleable quite.
1001,IV.,"One of my teachers at the boarding-school,"
1002,IV.,A little woman who got scanty pay
1003,IV.,"For teaching us in French and German, fed"
1004,IV.,"Her lonely heart with dreams of what, some day,"
1005,IV.,Shall lift her sex to nobler life. She took
1006,IV.,"A journal called 'The Good Time Coming,' filled"
1007,IV.,"With pleadings for reform of many kinds,--"
1008,IV.,"In education, physical and mental,"
1009,IV.,"Marriage, the rights of women, modes of living."
1010,IV.,Weekly I had the reading of it all;
1011,IV.,"Some of it crude enough, some apt and just,"
1012,IV.,"Forcibly put, and charged with vital facts."
1013,IV.,At last these had for me a fascination
1014,IV.,That quite eclipsed the novels of the day.
1015,IV.,
1016,IV.,"""I learnt, that, bound up in the moral law,"
1017,IV.,"Are laws of health and physical control,"
1018,IV.,Unheeded in the family and school;
1019,IV.,"How fashion, stupid pride, and love of show,"
1020,IV.,"The greed of gain, or the pursuit of pleasure,"
1021,IV.,"Empty and frivolous, make men and women"
1022,IV.,"False to their natures, cruel to each other"
1023,IV.,And to the unborn offspring they devote
1024,IV.,"To misery through ill-assorted unions,"
1025,IV.,Or habits reckless of maternal dues;
1026,IV.,"How marriage, sacredest of mortal steps,"
1027,IV.,Is entered on from motives all unworthy;
1028,IV.,"Social ambition, mercenary aims,"
1029,IV.,"The dread of poverty, of singleness,--"
1030,IV.,"The object of uniting families,--"
1031,IV.,And momentary passion fatuous.
1032,IV.,"So I resolved, God helping, to be true"
1033,IV.,"To my own self, and that way true to all."
1034,IV.,
1035,IV.,"""The fête that signalized my coming out"
1036,IV.,"Was, so my mother said, the costliest yet."
1037,IV.,Whole greenhouses were emptied to adorn
1038,IV.,Our rooms with flowers; a band played in the hall;
1039,IV.,The supper-table flashed with plate and silver
1040,IV.,And Dresden ware and bright Bohemian glass;
1041,IV.,The wines and viands were profuse and rare;
1042,IV.,"And everybody said, 'twas a grand ball."
1043,IV.,
1044,IV.,"""But what of her, for whom it was the flourish"
1045,IV.,Of trumpets blown to celebrate her entrance
1046,IV.,Into society? Let others speak!
1047,IV.,These the remarks I had to overhear:
1048,IV.,'She's rather pretty.'--'Pretty is the word.'
1049,IV.,'But not so dashing as the elder sisters.'
1050,IV.,"'Cleverer though, perhaps,'--'She takes it coolly."
1051,IV.,Her heart's not in the ball; that's evident.'
1052,IV.,'Where is it? Is she bookish?'--'So I've heard.'
1053,IV.,"'Unlike the rest, then.'--'That straw-colored silk"
1054,IV.,Should have had flounces.'--'Is that hair her own?'
1055,IV.,'I think so?'--'She's no dancer.'--'Apathetic
1056,IV.,As any duchess.'--'The young men seem shy;
1057,IV.,"She doesn't put them at their ease, 'tis plain.'"
1058,IV.,"'See, the old woman chides her; she deserves it;"
1059,IV.,She'll not pick up admirers if she plays
1060,IV.,My Lady Cool so grandly. Watch mamma.
1061,IV.,The hook is nicely baited; where are all
1062,IV.,The gudgeons it should lure? I marvel not
1063,IV.,"Mamma is in a fluster; tap, tap, tap,"
1064,IV.,"See her fan go! No strategy, no effort,"
1065,IV.,"No dandy-killing shot from languid eyes,"
1066,IV.,On that girl's part! And all this fuss for her!'
1067,IV.,
1068,IV.,"""The gossips, in these random whisperings,"
1069,IV.,"Made some good shots, that failed not of the mark."
1070,IV.,"The lights, the roses, the voluptuous music,"
1071,IV.,"The shining robes, the jewels, the bright faces"
1072,IV.,"Engrossed me not so much as one pale face,"
1073,IV.,"Youthful but pinched, which I had seen a moment,"
1074,IV.,"An hour before, reflected in the mirror"
1075,IV.,At which I stood while nimble dressing-maids
1076,IV.,Helped to array me. A poor girl had brought
1077,IV.,"The bodice of my silken robe, on which"
1078,IV.,She had been working closely; and my mother
1079,IV.,Chided her for delay; but no reply
1080,IV.,"Was made, save only what the pleading eyes"
1081,IV.,Could not withhold. Then tendering a scrap
1082,IV.,"Of paper, record of her paltry charge,"
1083,IV.,"She meekly stood. 'Pooh! bring it here next week,'"
1084,IV.,"My mother said. 'No!' turning round, I cried;"
1085,IV.,'Let her be paid at once; there must be money
1086,IV.,"In the house somewhere; it may be a loss,"
1087,IV.,"An inconvenience, for her to come back"
1088,IV.,Just for a trifling sum.'--'Impertinent!'
1089,IV.,"My mother kindling, cried.  'Do you rule here?'"
1090,IV.,"'I can return,' timidly said the girl."
1091,IV.,"Then a gold thimble from my drawer I took,"
1092,IV.,"And offered it, remarking, 'Keep or sell it,"
1093,IV.,To hold you good for all your wasted time.'
1094,IV.,"'My time,--what is it worth?' replied the girl,"
1095,IV.,"Motioning her refusal, but with smiles"
1096,IV.,"Of speechless gratitude, and then escaping"
1097,IV.,Before I could prevent her.
1098,IV.,
1099,IV.,"""'Novel-reading"
1100,IV.,"Has brought you to this insipidity,'"
1101,IV.,"My mother said: 'such sentimental pap,"
1102,IV.,"You never got from me. Come, hurry down;"
1103,IV.,Put off that sullen look. The carriages
1104,IV.,Begin to roll; the guests are on the stairs.
1105,IV.,"Learn to command your smiles, my dear. Now go.'"
1106,IV.,
1107,IV.,"""So down I went, but in no conquering mood."
1108,IV.,I did not scrutinize the festive dresses;
1109,IV.,"Of the sad hearts I thought, the poor thin hands"
1110,IV.,That put of life somewhat in every stitch
1111,IV.,For a grudged pittance. All disguises fell;
1112,IV.,"Voices betrayed the speakers in their tones,"
1113,IV.,Despite of flattering words; and smiles revealed
1114,IV.,The weariness or hatred they would hide.
1115,IV.,"And so, preoccupied and grave, I looked"
1116,IV.,On all the gayety; and reigning belles
1117,IV.,Took heart to find in me no coming rival.
1118,IV.,
1119,IV.,"""Lent now was near; the time of all diversion"
1120,IV.,And visiting was over; and my mother
1121,IV.,Summed up her griefs in this one lamentation:
1122,IV.,"'The season gone, and not one offer yet!"
1123,IV.,"You, Mary, are the first one of my daughters"
1124,IV.,Whose coming-out so flat a failure proved.
1125,IV.,Think of your sister Julia; her first winter
1126,IV.,Brought Hammersley to her feet. A splendid match!
1127,IV.,First cousin to a lord! How envious
1128,IV.,Were all the dowagers at my success!
1129,IV.,"If I've not done all that a mother could,"
1130,IV.,Tell me wherein I've failed. Yet one year more
1131,IV.,"I shall allow you for your trial. Then,"
1132,IV.,If you have made no step in the direction
1133,IV.,"Of matrimony, why, you must go off"
1134,IV.,"To Ireland, to America, or France,"
1135,IV.,And leave the field for your next younger
1136,IV.,"For Susan.'--'She is welcome to it now,'"
1137,IV.,"I said, with something like disdain, I fear,"
1138,IV.,"In my cold smile.--'My plans are laid, you know,'"
1139,IV.,Replied my mother; 'find your duty in
1140,IV.,A simple acquiescence; I know best.'
1141,IV.,
1142,IV.,"""'Tis said the woman always is to blame"
1143,IV.,If a man ventures to commit himself
1144,IV.,In a proposal unacceptable.
1145,IV.,The rule has its exceptions; for I gave
1146,IV.,"No word, no inkling of encouragement"
1147,IV.,To Captain Dudley; yet I had an offer
1148,IV.,"From Captain Dudley. Young, and elegant,"
1149,IV.,Though of a stock somewhat attenuate;
1150,IV.,"Rich, though a younger son; a gentleman,"
1151,IV.,"A scholar,--what good reason could I give"
1152,IV.,For saying Nay to such an applicant?
1153,IV.,"'Explain!' my mother cried, with brow severe;"
1154,IV.,'Is not his character without a flaw?'
1155,IV.,'So far as known to me.'--'Is he a fool?'
1156,IV.,'Far from it; culture and good sense are his.'
1157,IV.,"'Could you not love him?'--'Very tenderly,"
1158,IV.,"Perhaps, with time to aid.'--'Has any one"
1159,IV.,"Preoccupied your heart?'--'My heart is free,"
1160,IV.,And has been always free.'--'Indeed? Then why
1161,IV.,Refuse to be the wife of this young man?'
1162,IV.,'Simply because he's not the man I'd choose
1163,IV.,To be the father of a child of mine.'
1164,IV.,
1165,IV.,"""If I had put a pistol at her head,"
1166,IV.,My lady mother would not so have started.
1167,IV.,'What! a mere girl--and you can entertain
1168,IV.,"Such thoughts! so selfish, gross, unmaidenly!'"
1169,IV.,"'If,' I replied, 'I'm old enough to dream"
1170,IV.,"Of marriage, as you bid me, then 'tis time"
1171,IV.,For me to think of all the risk I run.
1172,IV.,"Selfish, you call it; gross, unmaidenly;"
1173,IV.,Is it unmaidenly to hesitate
1174,IV.,In the surrender of my maiden state?
1175,IV.,Your epithets belong to those who fail
1176,IV.,"To think at all, or only think of this:"
1177,IV.,What's the man's income? Will he let me have
1178,IV.,A house in the right quarter? Keep a carriage?
1179,IV.,And is he in society? Such women
1180,IV.,"Plant nightshade, and affect to wonder why"
1181,IV.,The growth is not of lilies and carnations!'
1182,IV.,
1183,IV.,"""'So! just let loose from school,' replied my mother,"
1184,IV.,'You'd teach me what is womanly! Pert minx!
1185,IV.,Tell me in simple English what you mean
1186,IV.,"By your objections to this match, so largely"
1187,IV.,Above your merits?'--'This is what I mean:
1188,IV.,"For reasons that are instincts more than reasons,"
1189,IV.,And therefore not to be explained to those
1190,IV.,"Who in them do not share, as you do not,"
1191,IV.,"I would not wed this man,--not if I loved him.'"
1192,IV.,'Enough! You've had your turn; and now prepare
1193,IV.,To make a visit to your father's cousin
1194,IV.,"In Nova Scotia; there, perhaps, you may"
1195,IV.,Find a congenial mate among the clowns
1196,IV.,And roughs provincial. Go and pack your trunk.
1197,IV.,Fool your own opportunities away;
1198,IV.,You shall not thrust your sister out of hers.'
1199,IV.,
1200,IV.,"""I did not pack my trunk; another suitor,"
1201,IV.,"One twice as rich as Dudley, kindled hopes"
1202,IV.,Anew in my poor mother's breast; and so
1203,IV.,"Susan was kept at school another season,"
1204,IV.,"And I was put upon the course once more,"
1205,IV.,My training perfect and my harness new!
1206,IV.,
1207,IV.,"""Who could object to Arthur Pennington?"
1208,IV.,"Son of a wealthy manufacturer,"
1209,IV.,"A type he was of English adolescence,"
1210,IV.,Trained by harmonious culture to the fulness
1211,IV.,Of all that Nature had supplied; a person
1212,IV.,That did not lack one manly grace; a mind
1213,IV.,"Which took the mould that social pressure gave,"
1214,IV.,Without one protest native to itself.
1215,IV.,"In the accepted, the conventional,"
1216,IV.,"He looked for Truth, nor ever had a doubt"
1217,IV.,Whether she might not hide in some deep well
1218,IV.,Rather than flaunt her modest purity
1219,IV.,In dusty highways. With my disposition
1220,IV.,To challenge all that human dogmatism
1221,IV.,"Imperious would impose upon my thought,"
1222,IV.,"What pretty yoke-fellows for life should we,"
1223,IV.,"Arthur and I, have been! Misled by hopes"
1224,IV.,"Which were inspired too fondly by my mother,"
1225,IV.,"He, too, proposed, and was of course rejected."
1226,IV.,
1227,IV.,"""Then the storm broke! The cup of my offences"
1228,IV.,Was overflowed at last. Now must I go--
1229,IV.,"Go, where she cared not; only disappear"
1230,IV.,From her domain; she washed her hands of me!
1231,IV.,"Hundreds of pounds had been invested in me,--"
1232,IV.,"My dresses, jewelry, and entertainments,--"
1233,IV.,"And here was the result! But no more money,"
1234,IV.,"From her, must I expect; my father's income"
1235,IV.,Had not for years been equal to his outlays.
1236,IV.,Any day he might be compelled to change
1237,IV.,His style of living; all had been kept up
1238,IV.,For the advantage of myself and sisters;
1239,IV.,And here was all the gratitude I showed!
1240,IV.,
1241,IV.,"""This time my mother was in earnest; so"
1242,IV.,Now must I lay my plans to go at once.
1243,IV.,Whither? to seek a transient home with one
1244,IV.,Of my own married sisters? Ah! the thought
1245,IV.,Of being dependent galled me like a spur.
1246,IV.,"No! go to work,--a voice within me said:"
1247,IV.,Think of the many thousands of your sex
1248,IV.,"Who, young and giddy, not equipped like you,"
1249,IV.,Are thrown upon the world to battle with it
1250,IV.,As best they may! Now try your closet virtue;
1251,IV.,"See if your theory can stand the proof,--"
1252,IV.,If trial will not warp your sense of right.
1253,IV.,"When Poverty shall dog your every step,"
1254,IV.,And at your scanty or unwholesome meal
1255,IV.,"Sit down, or with you, in your thin attire,"
1256,IV.,"Go shivering home at night from ill-paid toil,--"
1257,IV.,Then see if you can keep your feet from straying;
1258,IV.,Then choose as only Conscience bids you choose!
1259,IV.,
1260,IV.,"""The sewing-girl who worked upon my dress,"
1261,IV.,"The day of the great ball, was Lucy Merle;"
1262,IV.,I found her saving up her petty means
1263,IV.,"To go to London, to get better wages,--"
1264,IV.,"And said: 'Well, Lucy, let us go together.'"
1265,IV.,"She sold some jewels for me, and we went."
1266,IV.,
1267,IV.,"""In London! two unfriended girls in London!"
1268,IV.,"We hired a room, and got employment soon,"
1269,IV.,Such as it was; but small the recompense!
1270,IV.,"Though Lucy, quicker at her work than I,"
1271,IV.,Could earn enough to live upon--almost.
1272,IV.,For her the change was slight.
1273,IV.,
1274,IV.,"""A year we toiled"
1275,IV.,In company; and I'll not tell you all
1276,IV.,"The hardships, trials, wrongs, we underwent."
1277,IV.,"In my blue trunk you'll find a little pistol,"
1278,IV.,Got for our joint protection in those days.
1279,IV.,"May it be near you, should you ever need it!"
1280,IV.,"Finding, at length, I could no longer earn"
1281,IV.,"My share of our expenses by the needle,"
1282,IV.,I sought a situation as a nurse.
1283,IV.,And in 'The Times' I advertised my 'Want.'
1284,IV.,"An answer came, directing me to call"
1285,IV.,Upon the writer at a certain hour.
1286,IV.,I went. I met a man of middle age
1287,IV.,Whose name was Percival. I thought his manner
1288,IV.,Was coldly kind.
1289,IV.,
1290,IV.,"""'You're very young,' he said,"
1291,IV.,'To fill the situation of a nurse.
1292,IV.,What reference have you?' Not a distant thought
1293,IV.,Of such a need had ever troubled me!
1294,IV.,"'I bring,' said I, 'no reference.'--'That's a pity."
1295,IV.,What pledge have I of character?'--'Not any.'
1296,IV.,"And then, impatient at this let, I cried:"
1297,IV.,"'Look in my face, and if you find not there"
1298,IV.,"Pledge of my truth, Heaven help me, for 'tis all--"
1299,IV.,"All I can give!'--'Ah! my poor child,' said he,"
1300,IV.,'Such warrant have I learnt to take with doubt;
1301,IV.,"For I have known a face, too beautiful,"
1302,IV.,"With look of innocence and shining candor,"
1303,IV.,"Prove but the ambush of duplicity,"
1304,IV.,Pitiless and impure. But let me not
1305,IV.,"Distrust too far.' Then he turned up the gas,"
1306,IV.,"And, with a scrutiny intent and grave,"
1307,IV.,"Perused my face. 'What is your name?' he asked,"
1308,IV.,After a silence.--'Mary Merivale.'
1309,IV.,"'Well, Mary, I engage you; come at once."
1310,IV.,In the next room asleep reclines our patient.
1311,IV.,"As for your wages, we will say two guineas"
1312,IV.,"A week, if you're content.'--'O, perfectly!'"
1313,IV.,
1314,IV.,"""So, groping in my darkness, I at length"
1315,IV.,Hit on the door that issued into light.
1316,IV.,Long talks between the patient and his friend
1317,IV.,"Were frequent, and they heeded not my presence."
1318,IV.,Little by little Percival soon told
1319,IV.,"The story that you've heard, and more which you"
1320,IV.,May never hear in earthly interviews.
1321,IV.,"An eager listener, I would treasure up"
1322,IV.,"Each word, each look; and on my soul at last"
1323,IV.,"Dawned the pure ray by which I saw those traits,"
1324,IV.,"The spirit's own, that harmonized so well"
1325,IV.,With all the outward showed of good and noble.
1326,IV.,Strange that he took no notice of the way
1327,IV.,My very life was drifting! But to him
1328,IV.,"I seemed a child, and his paternal airs"
1329,IV.,Froze me and checked.
1330,IV.,
1331,IV.,"""A paragraph, 'The Times'"
1332,IV.,"Had published, when the accident took place,"
1333,IV.,"Mentioned that Kenrick was a millionnaire,"
1334,IV.,Though quite a young man still.
1335,IV.,
1336,IV.,"""A month went by"
1337,IV.,And he was able to sit up awhile;
1338,IV.,"And soon, with me beside him in the carriage,"
1339,IV.,"To take a drive;--when one day, Percival"
1340,IV.,"Said to me: 'Mary, you and I must try"
1341,IV.,The span to-day; our patient shall keep house.'
1342,IV.,My heart beat wildly; Kenrick looked as if
1343,IV.,Approving the arrangement; so we went.
1344,IV.,"'I wished,' said Percival, 'to talk with you"
1345,IV.,In private; do not answer if I put
1346,IV.,Questions that may embarrass or annoy;
1347,IV.,"It is no idle curiosity,"
1348,IV.,Prompting me now. We see that you were born
1349,IV.,To something better than this drudgery:
1350,IV.,"If not reluctant, tell me who you are.'"
1351,IV.,"'O, willingly!' I said."
1352,IV.,
1353,IV.,"""And so I told him"
1354,IV.,"All, from the first. He heard me patiently;"
1355,IV.,And then remarked: 'But do you never long
1356,IV.,For that secure and easy life at home?
1357,IV.,"You will go back to Liverpool, perchance,"
1358,IV.,When you've had quite enough of servitude
1359,IV.,"And toil precarious.'--'I go not back,'"
1360,IV.,"Said I, 'while health and liberty are left."
1361,IV.,The home that's grudged is not the home for me.
1362,IV.,"Give me but love, and like the reed I yield;"
1363,IV.,"Deal with me harshly, you may break, not bend me.'"
1364,IV.,"'Ah! there is something wrong in all these things,'"
1365,IV.,"Replied he, musing."
1366,IV.,
1367,IV.,"""'Yes,' I said; 'consider"
1368,IV.,What I've been telling of my mother's way
1369,IV.,"Of marrying her daughters; well, my mother"
1370,IV.,"Is but the product of that social system,"
1371,IV.,"Hollow and false, which leaves for dowerless girls"
1372,IV.,Few honorable outlooks for support
1373,IV.,"Excepting marriage.[2] Poor, dependent, helpless,"
1374,IV.,Untaught in any craft that could be made
1375,IV.,"To yield emolument,--our average women,--"
1376,IV.,What can they do but take the common path
1377,IV.,"Which my poor mother would have made _me_ try,"
1378,IV.,And lead some honest man to think that they
1379,IV.,"Are wedding _him_, and not his bank-account?"
1380,IV.,"Let woman, equally with man, be bred"
1381,IV.,To learn with thoroughness some craft or trade
1382,IV.,"By which she may support herself at least,"
1383,IV.,You place her more at liberty to shun
1384,IV.,"Unions, no priest, no church can sanctify!'[3]"
1385,IV.,
1386,IV.,"""Percival eyed me with a puzzled look,"
1387,IV.,"Then said: 'The time is on its way, I hope,"
1388,IV.,"When from her thraldom woman will come forth,"
1389,IV.,And in her own hands take her own redress;
1390,IV.,When laws disabling her shall not be made
1391,IV.,"Under the cowardly, untested plea"
1392,IV.,That man is better qualified than woman
1393,IV.,To estimate her needs and do her justice.
1394,IV.,Justice to her shall be to man advancement;
1395,IV.,And woman's wit can best heal woman's wrongs.
1396,IV.,"Accelerate that time, all women true"
1397,IV.,"To their own sex,--yet not so much to that"
1398,IV.,As to themselves and all the human race!
1399,IV.,"But pardon me; I wander from the point,--"
1400,IV.,"Following you. Now tell me, could you make"
1401,IV.,America your home?'
1402,IV.,
1403,IV.,"""The sudden question"
1404,IV.,"Made my heart leap, and the hot crimson rush"
1405,IV.,"Up to my brow. Silent I bowed my head,"
1406,IV.,"And he continued thus: 'If it should be,"
1407,IV.,"That one, not wholly alien to your tastes,--"
1408,IV.,"A man not quite so young as you, perhaps,"
1409,IV.,"But not beyond his prime,--an honest man,--"
1410,IV.,"I will not say with ample means, for that"
1411,IV.,"Would jar upon your heart,--one who could make"
1412,IV.,"Your home a plentiful and happy one,--"
1413,IV.,"Should offer you his hand,--would it deter you"
1414,IV.,To know that in America your lot
1415,IV.,Must henceforth be?'
1416,IV.,
1417,IV.,"""My breath came quick,--my eyes"
1418,IV.,"Turned swift away, lest he should mark their joy"
1419,IV.,"And count his prize too cheaply won. I sighed,"
1420,IV.,But did not speak. 'May I go on?' he asked.
1421,IV.,"A 'yes' distinct, though faint, flew from my lips."
1422,IV.,"'May I,' said he, 'tell Kenrick he may hope?'"
1423,IV.,"'What!' cried I, looking up, with something fiercer"
1424,IV.,"Than mere chagrin in my unguarded frown."""
1425,IV.,
1426,IV.,"Linda broke in upon the story here,"
1427,IV.,And turning to her father with a smile
1428,IV.,"Tender as dawning light, yet arch and gay,"
1429,IV.,"Cried, ""Fie, my father! Could you be so dull?"
1430,IV.,"How could you treat my future mother so?"""
1431,IV.,"""Nay, do not blame me hastily,"" said he,"
1432,IV.,With glad paternal eyes regarding her;
1433,IV.,"""How could a modest man--and I was one--"
1434,IV.,"Suppose that youth and wealth, and gracious gifts"
1435,IV.,"Of person, such as Kenrick wore so well,"
1436,IV.,"Could fail to win? Truly I did not dream,"
1437,IV.,"Spite of the proverb, Love could be so blind."""
1438,IV.,
1439,IV.,"Tossing her head with mock vindictive air,"
1440,IV.,"Like sweet sixteen, the mother then resumed:"
1441,IV.,"""Kenrick, it seems, being a bashful man,--"
1442,IV.,"And somewhat shy, perhaps, because I knew"
1443,IV.,He was but recently in mad pursuit
1444,IV.,"Of an unfaithful spouse, a runaway,"
1445,IV.,"Commissioned Percival to try the ground,"
1446,IV.,"Obscure and doubtful, of my woman's will."
1447,IV.,My absolute 'What!' was unequivocal.
1448,IV.,"Then turning to the coachman, Percival,"
1449,IV.,"Said, 'Home, now, home! and quickly!'"
1450,IV.,
1451,IV.,"""Home we rattled,"
1452,IV.,And both were silent to our journey's end.
1453,IV.,An eager glance he gave me as he touched
1454,IV.,My hand to help me from the carriage. He
1455,IV.,Has told me since that I returned the look
1456,IV.,"With one which, if not actually scorn,"
1457,IV.,"Was next of kin to scorn, and much resembling:--"
1458,IV.,All the chimera of his guilty conscience.
1459,IV.,
1460,IV.,"""Kenrick next day renewed his suit by letter;"
1461,IV.,"He begged I would not give a hasty 'No,'"
1462,IV.,But wait and grant him opportunities
1463,IV.,"To prove that he was worthy and sincere,"
1464,IV.,And to procure the requisite divorce.
1465,IV.,"While I was answering his letter, he"
1466,IV.,Drove out with Percival. My brief reply
1467,IV.,Told him there could be no decision other
1468,IV.,Than a complete and final negative.
1469,IV.,
1470,IV.,"""Then I sat down and ran my fingers over"
1471,IV.,The keys of the piano; and my mood
1472,IV.,At length expressed itself in that wild burst
1473,IV.,"Of a melodious anguish, which Edgardo"
1474,IV.,Gives vent to in 'Lucia.' Words could add
1475,IV.,Nothing to magnify the utter heart-break
1476,IV.,Of that despair; and Donizetti's score
1477,IV.,Has made the cry audible through the ages.
1478,IV.,Less from the instrument than from my heart
1479,IV.,Was wrung the passionate music.
1480,IV.,
1481,IV.,"""At its close,"
1482,IV.,"A long-drawn breath made me look round, and there"
1483,IV.,"Whom should I see but Percival, as if"
1484,IV.,Transfixed in mute surprise! 'I did not know
1485,IV.,"There was a listener,--had supposed you gone,'"
1486,IV.,Said I; and he replied: 'I thought you'd have
1487,IV.,Some word for Kenrick: so our drive was short.'
1488,IV.,'Nothing but this.' I handed him my letter;
1489,IV.,"He took it, bowed, and left me."
1490,IV.,
1491,IV.,"""The next day"
1492,IV.,I learnt that Kenrick had engaged his passage
1493,IV.,In Wednesday's steamer for New York. My stay
1494,IV.,Must now be brief; my services no longer
1495,IV.,Could be of any use; and so I wrote
1496,IV.,"Some formal lines, addressed to Percival,"
1497,IV.,"Asking for my dismissal, and conveying"
1498,IV.,To both the gentlemen my thanks sincere
1499,IV.,For all their kindness and munificence.
1500,IV.,"Two days I waited, but no answer came."
1501,IV.,
1502,IV.,"""The third day Kenrick sought an interview."
1503,IV.,"We met, and freely talked of this and that."
1504,IV.,"Said he, at last: 'Into what false, false ways"
1505,IV.,We plunge because we do not care to _think_!
1506,IV.,We shudder at Chinese morality
1507,IV.,When it allows a parent to destroy
1508,IV.,Superfluous female children. Look at home!
1509,IV.,Have we no ancient social superstitions
1510,IV.,Born of the same old barbarous family?
1511,IV.,"My life, Miss Merivale, has been so crowded"
1512,IV.,That I've had little time to trace opinion
1513,IV.,Down to its root before accepting it.
1514,IV.,"In giving opportunity for thought,"
1515,IV.,Sickness has been a brisk iconoclast.
1516,IV.,Behold the world's ideal of a wife![4]
1517,IV.,'Tis something like to this:
1518,IV.,
1519,IV.,"""'She marries young,"
1520,IV.,Perhaps in meek submission to the will
1521,IV.,"Parental, or in hope of a support;"
1522,IV.,"In a few years,--as heart and brain mature,"
1523,IV.,"And knowledge widens,--finds her lord and master"
1524,IV.,"Is a wrong-headed churl, a selfish tyrant,"
1525,IV.,"A miser, or a blockhead, or a brute;"
1526,IV.,"Her love for him, if love there ever was,"
1527,IV.,Is turned to hatred or indifference:
1528,IV.,What shall she do? The world has one reply:
1529,IV.,"You made your bed, and you must lie in it;"
1530,IV.,"True, you were heedless seventeen--no matter!"
1531,IV.,"True, a false sense of duty urged you on,"
1532,IV.,And you were wrongly influenced--no matter!
1533,IV.,Be his wife still; stand by him to the last;
1534,IV.,Do not rebel against his cruelty;
1535,IV.,"The more he plays the ruffian, the more merit"
1536,IV.,In your endurance! Suffering is your lot;
1537,IV.,It is the badge and jewel of a woman.
1538,IV.,Shun not contamination from his touch;
1539,IV.,"Keep having children by him, that his traits"
1540,IV.,And his bad blood may be continuous.
1541,IV.,Think that you love him still; and feed your heart
1542,IV.,"With all the lies you can, to keep it passive!"
1543,IV.,
1544,IV.,"""'So say the bellwethers who lead the many"
1545,IV.,"Over stone walls into the thorns and ditches,"
1546,IV.,Because their fathers took that way before them.
1547,IV.,Such is the popular morality!
1548,IV.,But is it moral? Nay; when man or woman
1549,IV.,"Can look up, with the heart of prayer, and say,"
1550,IV.,"Forbid it, Heaven, forbid it, self-respect,"
1551,IV.,"Forbid it, merciful regard for others,"
1552,IV.,"That this one should be parent to my child,--"
1553,IV.,That moment should the intimate relations
1554,IV.,"Of marriage end, and a release be found![5]"
1555,IV.,
1556,IV.,"""'How many blunder in mistaking Passion,"
1557,IV.,"Mixed with a little sentiment, for Love!"
1558,IV.,"Passion may lead to Love, as it may lead"
1559,IV.,"Away from Love, but Passion is not Love;"
1560,IV.,It may exist with Hate; too often leads
1561,IV.,"Its victim blindfold into hateful bonds,"
1562,IV.,Under the wild delusion that Love leads.
1563,IV.,"Love's bonds are adamant, and Love a slave;"
1564,IV.,And yet Love's service must be perfect freedom.
1565,IV.,"Candor it craves, for Love is innocent,--"
1566,IV.,"But no enforced fidelity, no ties"
1567,IV.,Such as the harem shelters. Dupes are they
1568,IV.,Who think that Love can ever be compelled!
1569,IV.,"Only what's lovely Love can truly love,"
1570,IV.,And fickleness and falsehood are deformed.
1571,IV.,"Reveal their features, Love may mourn indeed,"
1572,IV.,"But will not rave. Love, even when abandoned,"
1573,IV.,Feels pity and not anger for the heart
1574,IV.,That could not prize Love's warm fidelity.
1575,IV.,"But Passion, selfish, proud, and murderous,"
1576,IV.,"Seizes the pistol or the knife, and kills;--"
1577,IV.,And cozened juries make a heroine
1578,IV.,"Of her who, stung with jealousy or pride,"
1579,IV.,"Or, by some meaner motive, hurled a wreck,"
1580,IV.,Assassinates her too inconstant wooer.
1581,IV.,
1582,IV.,"""'Now do I see how little, in my case,"
1583,IV.,"There was of actual love, how much of passion!"
1584,IV.,"Love's day for me, if it may ever come"
1585,IV.,"In this brief stage, is yet to dawn. You smile;"
1586,IV.,"Love must have hope, a ray of hope, at least,"
1587,IV.,"To catch the hue of life; and so, Miss Mary,"
1588,IV.,I'll not profess to love you; all I say
1589,IV.,"Is, that a little hope from you would make me!"
1590,IV.,"But, since we can't be lovers, let's be friends;"
1591,IV.,"Here, in this little wallet, is a check"
1592,IV.,For an amount that will secure your future
1593,IV.,"From serious want,--a sum I shall not miss."
1594,IV.,But which--'
1595,IV.,
1596,IV.,"""With many thanks I answered 'No!'"
1597,IV.,"'What can I do?' he asked, 'to show my debt"
1598,IV.,"To you and Percival?' I shook my head,"
1599,IV.,And something in the sadness of my smile
1600,IV.,Arrested his attention. But that moment
1601,IV.,"A girl rushed in with cry of 'O, he's killed--"
1602,IV.,"Killed, the poor man!'--'Who?'--'Mr. Percival!'"
1603,IV.,"The name was like a blow upon my heart,"
1604,IV.,"And Kenrick saw it, and supported me."
1605,IV.,
1606,IV.,"""But in a moment I was strong. I heard"
1607,IV.,"A scuffling noise of people at the door,"
1608,IV.,And then a form--'twas Percival's--was borne
1609,IV.,"Into a room, and placed upon a bed."
1610,IV.,Pale and insensible he lay; a surgeon
1611,IV.,Came in; at last we got an explanation:
1612,IV.,In rescuing from a frightened horse the child
1613,IV.,"Of a poor woman, Percival had been"
1614,IV.,"Thrown down, an arm been broken, and the pain"
1615,IV.,"Had made him faint. My nervous laugh of joy,"
1616,IV.,When I was sure that this was the extreme
1617,IV.,"Of injury, betrayed my reckless heart,"
1618,IV.,And Kenrick had my secret. Percival
1619,IV.,"Was soon himself; the broken limb was set,"
1620,IV.,"And I, engaged to stay another week"
1621,IV.,To wait on the new patient--nothing loath.
1622,IV.,
1623,IV.,"""The day of his departure, Kenrick drew me"
1624,IV.,"Aside, and, in a whisper, said, 'He loves you!'"
1625,IV.,'Loves me?' With palms held tightly on my breast
1626,IV.,"To keep my heart down, I repeated, 'Loves me?'"
1627,IV.,"'Twas hard to credit. 'Pardon me,' said Kenrick,"
1628,IV.,"'If by communication of your secret,"
1629,IV.,I changed the desolation of his life
1630,IV.,"To sudden bloom and fragrance, for a moment.'"
1631,IV.,'A moment only?'--'Soon his scruples rose:
1632,IV.,It cannot be! he said; two mountains lie
1633,IV.,Between my fate and hers.--Two bubbles rather!
1634,IV.,Retorted I; let's take their altitude.--
1635,IV.,One is my age.--That mountain is already
1636,IV.,"Tunnelled or levelled, since she sees it not.--"
1637,IV.,The other is that infamous decree
1638,IV.,"Against me at the period of my suit,"
1639,IV.,"Granting the guilty party a divorce,"
1640,IV.,But me prohibiting to wed again.--
1641,IV.,"Well, that decree (I answered bitterly)"
1642,IV.,Would have with me the weight of a request
1643,IV.,That I'd hereafter quaff at common puddles
1644,IV.,And not at one pure fount; I'd heed the bar
1645,IV.,As I would heed the grass-webbed gossamer;
1646,IV.,I'd sooner balk a bench of drivellers
1647,IV.,Than outrage sacred nature.--If that bench
1648,IV.,"Could have you up for bigamy, what then?--"
1649,IV.,The dear old dames! they should not have the means
1650,IV.,To prove it on me: for the pact should be
1651,IV.,'Twixt me and her who would accept my troth
1652,IV.,Freely before high heaven and all its angels:
1653,IV.,"Witnesses which the sheriff could not summon,"
1654,IV.,"Could not, at least, produce.--But, Kenrick, you"
1655,IV.,Do not consider all the risk and pain;
1656,IV.,"The social stigma, and, should children come,"
1657,IV.,"The grief, the shame, the disrepute to them.--"
1658,IV.,"To which I answered: God's great gift of life,"
1659,IV.,"Coming through parentage select and pure,"
1660,IV.,"To me is such a sacred, sacred thing,"
1661,IV.,"So precious, so inestimably precious,"
1662,IV.,That your objections seem of small account;
1663,IV.,Since only stunted hearts and slavish minds
1664,IV.,"Could visit on your children disrepute,"
1665,IV.,"Who fitly could ignore such Brahmanism,"
1666,IV.,"Since they'd be born, most probably, with brains."
1667,IV.,
1668,IV.,"""'When the neglect of form, if 'tis neglected,"
1669,IV.,"Is all in honor, purged of selfishness,"
1670,IV.,Where shall the heart and reason lay the blame?
1671,IV.,But understand me: Would I cheapen form?
1672,IV.,"Nay, I should fear that those who would evade it,"
1673,IV.,"Without a reason potent as your own,"
1674,IV.,Trifled with danger. But I cannot make
1675,IV.,"A god of form, an idol crushing me."
1676,IV.,"Unlike the church, I look on marriage as"
1677,IV.,"A civil contract, not a sacrament,[6]"
1678,IV.,"Indissoluble, spite of every wrong;"
1679,IV.,The high and holy purposes of marriage
1680,IV.,Are not fulfilled in instances where each
1681,IV.,Helps to demoralize or blight the other;
1682,IV.,"Let it then stand, like other contracts, on"
1683,IV.,A basis purely personal and legal.
1684,IV.,
1685,IV.,"""'Oh! how we hug the fictions we are born to!"
1686,IV.,"Challenging never, never testing them;"
1687,IV.,Accepting them as irreversible;
1688,IV.,"Part of God's order, not to be improved;"
1689,IV.,"Placing the form above the informing spirit,"
1690,IV.,The outward show above the inward life;
1691,IV.,"A hollow lie, well varnished, well played out,"
1692,IV.,"Above the pure, the everlasting truth;"
1693,IV.,"Fancying Nature is not Nature still,"
1694,IV.,"Because repressed, or cheated, or concealed;"
1695,IV.,"Juggling ourselves with frauds a very child,"
1696,IV.,"Yet unperverted, readily would pierce!"
1697,IV.,
1698,IV.,"""'Consider my own case: a month ago,"
1699,IV.,"See me a maniac, rushing forth to find"
1700,IV.,A wife who loved me not; my heart all swollen
1701,IV.,With rage against the man to whom I owed
1702,IV.,"Exposure of her falsehood; ah, how blind!"
1703,IV.,To chase a form from which the soul had fled!
1704,IV.,"If I grew sane at length, you, Percival,"
1705,IV.,And the mere presence of our little nurse
1706,IV.,"Have brought me light and healing. I am cured,"
1707,IV.,"Thank Heaven, and can exult at my release."
1708,IV.,
1709,IV.,"""'Here I paused. Percival made no reply,"
1710,IV.,But sat like one absorbed. I paced the floor
1711,IV.,"Awhile, and then confronting him resumed:--"
1712,IV.,"Your scruples daunt you still; well, there's a way"
1713,IV.,To free you from the meshes of the law:
1714,IV.,"On my return, I'll go to Albany,"
1715,IV.,"Where war's financial sinews, as you know,"
1716,IV.,Are those of legislation equally;
1717,IV.,I'll have a law put through to meet your case;
1718,IV.,To strip away these toils. I can; I will!--
1719,IV.,Percival almost stunned me with his No!
1720,IV.,"Make _me_ a gutter, adding more pollution"
1721,IV.,To the fount of public justice? Never! No!
1722,IV.,"I would not feed corruption with a bribe,"
1723,IV.,To win release to-morrow. Such a cure
1724,IV.,"Would be, my friend, far worse than the disease.--"
1725,IV.,"Then there's no way, said I; and so, farewell!"
1726,IV.,The carriage waits to take me to the station.--
1727,IV.,I shall not say farewell until we part
1728,IV.,"Beside the carriage-door, said he: you'll take"
1729,IV.,"Your leave of Mary?--Yes, I go to seek her.--"
1730,IV.,"And this, Miss Mary, is a full report"
1731,IV.,Of all that passed between my friend and me.'
1732,IV.,
1733,IV.,"""Here Kenrick ended. He had been, methought,"
1734,IV.,"Thus copious, in the hope his argument"
1735,IV.,Would make me look as scornfully as he
1736,IV.,On obstacles that Percival would raise.
1737,IV.,"I thanked him for his courtesy, and then,"
1738,IV.,"Not without some emotion, we two parted."
1739,IV.,When the last sound of the retiring wheels
1740,IV.,"Was drowned in other noises, Percival"
1741,IV.,"Came in, and found me waiting in the parlor."
1742,IV.,"'Now let me have a talk with you,' he said."
1743,IV.,"So, in the little parlor we sat down."
1744,IV.,"I see it now, all vividly before me!"
1745,IV.,"The carpet--ay, its very hues and figures:"
1746,IV.,"The chandelier, the sofa, the engraving"
1747,IV.,Of Wellington that hung above the mantel;
1748,IV.,"The little bookcase, holding Scott and Irving,"
1749,IV.,"And Gibbon's Rome, and Eloisa's Letters;"
1750,IV.,"And, in a vase, upon the marble stand,"
1751,IV.,An opening rose-bud I had plucked that day--
1752,IV.,"Type of my own unfolding, rosy hope!"
1753,IV.,
1754,IV.,"""Said Percival: 'We'll not amuse each other"
1755,IV.,With words indifferent; and we'll allow
1756,IV.,Small opportunity for hearts to speak:
1757,IV.,"We know what they would utter, might we dare"
1758,IV.,To give them audience. Let Reason rule.
1759,IV.,What I propose is this: that we now part--
1760,IV.,"Part for two years; and when that term shall end,"
1761,IV.,"If we are still in heart disposed as now,"
1762,IV.,"Then can we orient ourselves anew,"
1763,IV.,And shape our course as wary conscience bids.
1764,IV.,"Till then, no meeting and no correspondence!"
1765,IV.,
1766,IV.,"""'Now for conditions more particular:"
1767,IV.,You have a sister--Mrs. Hammersley--
1768,IV.,"Julia, I think you said,--an elder sister,"
1769,IV.,"Resident here, and in society,"
1770,IV.,But fretted by her lord's extravagance
1771,IV.,And her own impecuniosity.
1772,IV.,"You at her house shall be a visitor,"
1773,IV.,But not without the means of aiding her;
1774,IV.,And who but I can now supply the means?
1775,IV.,Here's the dilemma: how can you be free
1776,IV.,"If you're my debtor? Yet you _must_ be free,"
1777,IV.,And promise to be free; nor let my gift
1778,IV.,Sway you one jot in trammelling your heart.
1779,IV.,Two years you'll spend with Mrs. Hammersley;
1780,IV.,Accepting all Society can offer
1781,IV.,To welcome youth and beauty to its lap;
1782,IV.,Keeping your heart as open as you can
1783,IV.,To influences and impressions new;
1784,IV.,"For, Mary, bear in mind how young you are!"
1785,IV.,"So much for _you_. On _my_ part, I'll return"
1786,IV.,"To my own country, and endeavor there"
1787,IV.,Once more to rectify the wretched wrong
1788,IV.,That circumscribes me. I shall fail perhaps--
1789,IV.,But we can be prepared for either issue.'
1790,IV.,
1791,IV.,"""Here he was silent, and I said: 'You're right,"
1792,IV.,And I accept your terms without reserve.'
1793,IV.,"We parted, and except a clasp of hands"
1794,IV.,"That lingered in each other, and a glance"
1795,IV.,"That flashed farewell from eyes enthroning truth,"
1796,IV.,There was no outward token of our love.
1797,IV.,
1798,IV.,"""Two years (the longest of my life were they!)"
1799,IV.,"Emptied their sands at last, and then I wrote"
1800,IV.,"A letter to him, to the Barings' care,"
1801,IV.,Containing one word only; this: '_Unchanged._'
1802,IV.,In the same old familiar room we met:
1803,IV.,"Eager I gave my hand; but he drew back,"
1804,IV.,"Folded his arms, and said, with half a smile:"
1805,IV.,''Tis not for me; still am I under ban!'
1806,IV.,'I'm glad of that!' cried I; ''twill help to show
1807,IV.,"How slight, to love like mine, impediments"
1808,IV.,Injustice can pile up!'
1809,IV.,
1810,IV.,"""He took my hand,"
1811,IV.,"And, for the first time, we exchanged a kiss."
1812,IV.,Then we sat down and freely talked. Said he:
1813,IV.,'Baffled in all my efforts to procure
1814,IV.,"Reversal of my sentence, I resolved"
1815,IV.,To terminate one misery at least:
1816,IV.,"Yearly the court compelled me, through my bondsmen,"
1817,IV.,"To render an account of all my income,"
1818,IV.,Of which the larger portion must be paid
1819,IV.,"For the support of my betrayer, and"
1820,IV.,"The child, called, by a legal fiction, mine."
1821,IV.,To this annoyance of an annual dealing
1822,IV.,"With her attorney, I would put an end;"
1823,IV.,And so I compromised by giving up
1824,IV.,Two thirds of all my property at once.
1825,IV.,This leaves me free from all entanglement
1826,IV.,"With her or hers,--though with diminished means."
1827,IV.,
1828,IV.,"""'And now, since still you venture to confide"
1829,IV.,"Wholly in me, my Mary Merivale,--"
1830,IV.,And since you would intrust your happiness
1831,IV.,"To one who can but give you love for love,--"
1832,IV.,"To make our income certain, 'tis my plan"
1833,IV.,Straightway my little remnant to convert
1834,IV.,"Into a joint annuity, to last"
1835,IV.,During our natural lives: this will secure
1836,IV.,"A fair, though not munificent support."
1837,IV.,"And since for me you put the gay world by,"
1838,IV.,"And since for you I make no sacrifice,"
1839,IV.,Now shape our way of life as you may choose.'
1840,IV.,
1841,IV.,"""This I disclaimed; but we at last arranged"
1842,IV.,"That on the morrow, in the presence of"
1843,IV.,"My poor friend Lucy, and my sister Julia,"
1844,IV.,We two should take each other by the hand
1845,IV.,As emblem of a pledge including all
1846,IV.,"Of sacred and inviolable, all"
1847,IV.,"Of holy and sincere, that man and woman,"
1848,IV.,"Uniting for connubial purposes,"
1849,IV.,"And with no purpose foreign to right love,"
1850,IV.,"Can, with responsible intelligence,"
1851,IV.,"Give to each other in the face of God,"
1852,IV.,And before human witnesses.
1853,IV.,
1854,IV.,"""And so"
1855,IV.,The simple rite--if such it could be called--
1856,IV.,"Took place. A formal kiss was interchanged,"
1857,IV.,"And then we all knelt down, and Percival"
1858,IV.,Met our hearts' need with such a simple prayer
1859,IV.,As by its quickening and inspiring faith
1860,IV.,"Made us forget it was another's voice,"
1861,IV.,"Not our own hearts, that spoke. My sister Julia"
1862,IV.,"Wept, not for me, but for herself, poor child!"
1863,IV.,"The chill, the gloom of an unhappy future"
1864,IV.,"Crept on her lot already, like a mist"
1865,IV.,"Foreshadowing the storm; she saw, not distant,"
1866,IV.,All the despair of a regretful marriage
1867,IV.,Menacing her and driving forth her children.
1868,IV.,"It did not long delay. Her spendthrift lord,"
1869,IV.,"After a squander of his own estate,"
1870,IV.,And after swindling my confiding father
1871,IV.,"Of a large sum, deserted wife and children,"
1872,IV.,To play the chevalier of industry
1873,IV.,"At Baden, or at Homburg, and put on"
1874,IV.,More of the aspect of the beast each day.
1875,IV.,Three children have his blood to strive against.
1876,IV.,Poor Julia! What she has to live on now
1877,IV.,"Was given by Linda's father. We found means,"
1878,IV.,"Also, to set up our poor sewing-girl,"
1879,IV.,"My old companion, Lucy, in a trade"
1880,IV.,"In which she thrives,--she and a worthy husband."
1881,IV.,
1882,IV.,"""What said my parents? Well, I wrote them soon,"
1883,IV.,"Relating all the facts without reserve,"
1884,IV.,"And asking, 'Would it be agreeable to them"
1885,IV.,"To have a visit from us?' They replied,"
1886,IV.,"'It will not be agreeable, for our house"
1887,IV.,"Is one of good repute.'--Not three years after,"
1888,IV.,A joint appeal came to us for their aid
1889,IV.,To the amount of seven hundred pounds.
1890,IV.,"We sent the money, and it helped to smooth"
1891,IV.,Their latter days; perhaps to mitigate
1892,IV.,The anger they had felt; and yet not they:
1893,IV.,Of the ungenerous words addressed to us
1894,IV.,My father never knew.
1895,IV.,
1896,IV.,"""We met my sisters,"
1897,IV.,"Through Julia's urging, I believe, and proudly"
1898,IV.,I let them see what sort of man I'd chosen.
1899,IV.,"We travelled for a time in England; then,"
1900,IV.,"In travel and in study, spent three years"
1901,IV.,Upon the Continent; and sailed at last
1902,IV.,For the great land to which my thoughts had turned
1903,IV.,So often--for America. Arriving
1904,IV.,"Here in New York, we took this little house,"
1905,IV.,Scene of so many joys and one great woe;
1906,IV.,And yet a woe so full of heavenly life
1907,IV.,We should not call it by a mournful name.
1908,IV.,
1909,IV.,"""At length our Linda came to make all bright;"
1910,IV.,"And I can say, should the great summoner"
1911,IV.,"Call me this day to leave you, liberal Heaven"
1912,IV.,More than my share of mortal bliss already
1913,IV.,"Would have bestowed. Yes, little Linda came!"
1914,IV.,To spoil us for all happiness but that
1915,IV.,In which she too could share--the dear beguiler!
1916,IV.,"And with the sceptre of her love she ruled us,"
1917,IV.,"And with a happy spirit's charm she charmed us,"
1918,IV.,"Artfully conquering by shunning conquest,"
1919,IV.,And by obeying making us obey.
1920,IV.,"And so, one day, one happy day in June,"
1921,IV.,"We all sat down together, and her mother"
1922,IV.,"Told her the story which here terminates."""

1931,PARADISE FOUND.,
1932,PARADISE FOUND.,"""You might have made it longer,"" murmured Linda,"
1933,PARADISE FOUND.,"Who with moist eyes had listened, and to whom"
1934,PARADISE FOUND.,The time had seemed inexplicably brief.
1935,PARADISE FOUND.,"Then with an arm round either parent's neck,"
1936,PARADISE FOUND.,"And with a kiss on either parent's cheek,"
1937,PARADISE FOUND.,"She said: ""My lot is as the good God gave it;"
1938,PARADISE FOUND.,And I'd not have it other than it is.
1939,PARADISE FOUND.,Could a permit from any human lips
1940,PARADISE FOUND.,Have made me any more a child of God?
1941,PARADISE FOUND.,"Have made me any more your child, my parents?"
1942,PARADISE FOUND.,Have made me any more my own true self?
1943,PARADISE FOUND.,"Happy, and oh! not diffident to feel"
1944,PARADISE FOUND.,My right to be and breathe the common air?
1945,PARADISE FOUND.,Could any form of words approving it
1946,PARADISE FOUND.,Have made us three more intimately near?
1947,PARADISE FOUND.,Have made us three more exquisitely dear?
1948,PARADISE FOUND.,"Ah! if it could, our love is not the love"
1949,PARADISE FOUND.,"I hold it now to be--immortal love!"""
1950,PARADISE FOUND.,
1951,PARADISE FOUND.,With speechless joy and a new pride they gazed
1952,PARADISE FOUND.,"Into her fair and youthful countenance,"
1953,PARADISE FOUND.,Bright with ethereal bloom and tenderness.
1954,PARADISE FOUND.,"Then smoothing back her hair, the father said:"
1955,PARADISE FOUND.,"""An anxious thought comes to us now and then,--"
1956,PARADISE FOUND.,Comes like a cloud: the thought that we as yet
1957,PARADISE FOUND.,Have no provision from our income saved
1958,PARADISE FOUND.,"For Linda. My few little ventures, made"
1959,PARADISE FOUND.,"In commerce, in a profitable hope,"
1960,PARADISE FOUND.,So adversely resulted that I saw
1961,PARADISE FOUND.,My best advance would be in standing still.
1962,PARADISE FOUND.,"As you have heard, all that we now possess"
1963,PARADISE FOUND.,Is in a life-annuity which ends
1964,PARADISE FOUND.,With two frail lives--your mother's and my own.
1965,PARADISE FOUND.,"So, should death overtake us both at once,--"
1966,PARADISE FOUND.,"And this I've looked on as improbable,--"
1967,PARADISE FOUND.,"Our little girl would be left destitute."""
1968,PARADISE FOUND.,
1969,PARADISE FOUND.,"""Not destitute, my father!"" Linda cried;"
1970,PARADISE FOUND.,"""Far back as thought can go, you taught me this:"
1971,PARADISE FOUND.,"To help myself; to seek, in my own mind,"
1972,PARADISE FOUND.,"Companionship forever new and glad,"
1973,PARADISE FOUND.,"Through studies, meditations, and resources"
1974,PARADISE FOUND.,"Which nature, books, and crowded life supply."
1975,PARADISE FOUND.,And then you urged me to excel in something;
1976,PARADISE FOUND.,"('Better do one thing thoroughly,' you said,"
1977,PARADISE FOUND.,"'Than fifty only tolerably well,')--"
1978,PARADISE FOUND.,"Something from which, with loving diligence,"
1979,PARADISE FOUND.,"I might, should life's contingencies require,"
1980,PARADISE FOUND.,"Wring a support;--and then, how carefully"
1981,PARADISE FOUND.,You taught me how to deal with slippery men!
1982,PARADISE FOUND.,"Taught me my rights, the laws, the very forms"
1983,PARADISE FOUND.,By which to guard against neglect or fraud
1984,PARADISE FOUND.,In any business--till I'm half a lawyer.
1985,PARADISE FOUND.,"You taught me, too, how to protect myself,"
1986,PARADISE FOUND.,"Should force assail me; how to hold a pistol,"
1987,PARADISE FOUND.,"Carry it, fire it--Heaven save me from the need!"
1988,PARADISE FOUND.,"And, when I was a very little girl,"
1989,PARADISE FOUND.,You used to take me round to see the houses
1990,PARADISE FOUND.,As they were built; the clearing of the land;
1991,PARADISE FOUND.,The digging of the cellar; the foundations;
1992,PARADISE FOUND.,You told me that the sand to make the mortar
1993,PARADISE FOUND.,"Ought to be fresh, and not the sea-shore sand;"
1994,PARADISE FOUND.,Else would the salt keep up a certain moisture.
1995,PARADISE FOUND.,"And then we'd watch the framework, and the roofing;"
1996,PARADISE FOUND.,And you'd explain the office and the name
1997,PARADISE FOUND.,"Of every beam, and make me understand"
1998,PARADISE FOUND.,"The qualities of wood, seasoning of timber,"
1999,PARADISE FOUND.,"And how the masons, and the carpenters,"
2000,PARADISE FOUND.,"The plasterers, the plumbers, and the slaters,"
2001,PARADISE FOUND.,"Should do their work; and when they slighted it,"
2002,PARADISE FOUND.,"And when the wood-work was too near the flue,"
2003,PARADISE FOUND.,"The flue too narrow, or the draught defective:"
2004,PARADISE FOUND.,"So that, as you yourself have often said,"
2005,PARADISE FOUND.,I'm better qualified than half the builders
2006,PARADISE FOUND.,"To plan and build a house, and guard myself"
2007,PARADISE FOUND.,From being cheated in the operation.
2008,PARADISE FOUND.,"Fear not for me, my parents; spend your income"
2009,PARADISE FOUND.,"Without a thought of saving. And besides,"
2010,PARADISE FOUND.,"Had you not trained me aptly as you have,"
2011,PARADISE FOUND.,Am I not better--I--than many sparrows?
2012,PARADISE FOUND.,"There is a heavenly Father over all!"""
2013,PARADISE FOUND.,
2014,PARADISE FOUND.,"""Sweet arguer!"" said Percival, ""may He"
2015,PARADISE FOUND.,And his swift angels love and help our Linda!
2016,PARADISE FOUND.,Your mother and myself have tried of late
2017,PARADISE FOUND.,To study how and where we might reduce
2018,PARADISE FOUND.,"Certain expenses that have been,----"""
2019,PARADISE FOUND.,
2020,PARADISE FOUND.,But here
2021,PARADISE FOUND.,The dinner-bell broke in; and lighter thoughts--
2022,PARADISE FOUND.,"Thoughts that but skim the surface of the mind,"
2023,PARADISE FOUND.,And stir not its profound--were interchanged
2024,PARADISE FOUND.,As now more timely; for the Percivals
2025,PARADISE FOUND.,"Lacked not good appetites, and every meal"
2026,PARADISE FOUND.,Had its best stimulant in cheerfulness.
2027,PARADISE FOUND.,"""Where shall we go to pass our holidays?"""
2028,PARADISE FOUND.,"The mother asked: ""August will soon be here."""
2029,PARADISE FOUND.,"""What says our Linda?"" answered Percival:"
2030,PARADISE FOUND.,"""The seaside or the mountains shall it be?"""
2031,PARADISE FOUND.,"""Linda will go with the majority!"
2032,PARADISE FOUND.,"You've spilt the salt, papa; please throw a little"
2033,PARADISE FOUND.,Over your shoulder; there! that saves a quarrel.
2034,PARADISE FOUND.,"To me you leave it, do you? to decide"
2035,PARADISE FOUND.,Where we shall go? Then hear the voice of wisdom:
2036,PARADISE FOUND.,"The mountain air is good, I love the mountains;"
2037,PARADISE FOUND.,"And the sea air is good, I love the sea;"
2038,PARADISE FOUND.,"But if you two prefer the mountain air,--"
2039,PARADISE FOUND.,"Go to the mountains. On the contrary,--"""
2040,PARADISE FOUND.,"""She's neutral!"" cried the father; ""what a dodger"
2041,PARADISE FOUND.,"This little girl has grown! Come, now, I'll cast"
2042,PARADISE FOUND.,"Into the scale my sword, and say we'll go"
2043,PARADISE FOUND.,To old Cape Ann. Does any slave object?
2044,PARADISE FOUND.,None. 'Tis a special edict. Pass the peas.
2045,PARADISE FOUND.,Our rendezvous shall be off Eastern Point.
2046,PARADISE FOUND.,"There shall our Linda try the oar again."""
2047,PARADISE FOUND.,
2048,PARADISE FOUND.,"Dinner was ended, and the gas was lit,"
2049,PARADISE FOUND.,And The Day's last edition had been put
2050,PARADISE FOUND.,"Into his hand to read, when suddenly"
2051,PARADISE FOUND.,"Turning to Mary, with a sigh he said:"
2052,PARADISE FOUND.,"""Kenrick, I see, is dead--Kenrick, our friend."
2053,PARADISE FOUND.,"'Died in Chicago on the seventh instant,--"
2054,PARADISE FOUND.,"Leaves an estate valued at seven millions.'"""
2055,PARADISE FOUND.,"""Indeed! our faithful Kenrick--is he dead?"
2056,PARADISE FOUND.,"Leaves he a wife?""--""Probably not, my dear;"
2057,PARADISE FOUND.,Three months ago he was a single man;
2058,PARADISE FOUND.,"I had a letter from him, begging me,"
2059,PARADISE FOUND.,If I lacked funds at any time to draw
2060,PARADISE FOUND.,"On him, and not be modest in my draft."""
2061,PARADISE FOUND.,"""But that was generous; what did you reply?"""
2062,PARADISE FOUND.,"""I thanked him for his love, and promised him"
2063,PARADISE FOUND.,He should be first to hear of wants of mine.
2064,PARADISE FOUND.,"Now let us to the music-room adjourn,"
2065,PARADISE FOUND.,"And hear what will not jar with our regrets."""
2066,PARADISE FOUND.,They went; and Mary mother played and sang;
2067,PARADISE FOUND.,"Played the 'Dead March in Saul' and sang 'Old Hundred,'"
2068,PARADISE FOUND.,"'Come, ye Disconsolate,' 'When thee I seek'--"
2069,PARADISE FOUND.,And finally these unfamiliar words:--
2070,PARADISE FOUND.,
2071,PARADISE FOUND.,
2072,I.,I.
2073,I.,
2074,I.,"O, give me one breath from that land--"
2075,I.,The land to which all of us go!
2076,I.,"Even now, O my soul! art thou fanned"
2077,I.,By the breezes that over it blow.
2078,I.,
2079,II.,II.
2080,II.,
2081,II.,By the breezes that over it blow!
2082,II.,"Though far from the knowledge of sense,"
2083,II.,The shore of that land thou dost know--
2084,II.,There soon wilt thou go with me hence.
2085,II.,
2086,III.,III.
2087,III.,
2088,III.,There soon wilt thou go with me hence--
2089,III.,"But where, O my soul! where to be?"
2090,III.,"In that region, that region immense,"
2091,III.,The loved and the lost shall we see?
2092,III.,
2093,IV.,IV.
2094,IV.,
2095,IV.,The loved and the lost shall we see!
2096,IV.,For Love all it loves shall make near;
2097,IV.,Type and outcome of Love shall it be--
2098,IV.,Our home in that infinite sphere!
2099,IV.,
2100,IV.,
2101,IV.,A day's excursion to a favorite spot--
2102,IV.,"Choice nook among the choicest of Long Island,"
2103,IV.,"(Paradise Found, he called it playfully)--"
2104,IV.,Had oft been planned; and one day Percival
2105,IV.,"Said: ""Let us go to-day!""--""No, not to-day!"""
2106,IV.,"Cried Linda, with a shudder.--""And why not?"
2107,IV.,It is the very day of all the year!
2108,IV.,"There's an elastic coolness in the air,"
2109,IV.,Thanks to the thunder-shower we had last night:
2110,IV.,"A day for out-of-doors! Your reasons, Linda?"
2111,IV.,"Tears in your eyes! Nay, I'll not ask for reasons."
2112,IV.,"We will not go.""--""Yes, father, let us go."
2113,IV.,"Whence came my No abrupt, I could not say;"
2114,IV.,"It was a sudden freak, and what it meant"
2115,IV.,"You know as well as I. Shall we get ready?"""
2116,IV.,"""Ay, such a perfect day is rare; it seems"
2117,IV.,To bring heaven nearer to my understanding;
2118,IV.,"Life, life itself is joy enough! to be,--"
2119,IV.,"To breathe this ether, see that arch of blue,"
2120,IV.,"Is happiness.""--""But 'tis the soul that makes it;"
2121,IV.,"What would it be, my father, without love?"""
2122,IV.,"""Ay, without love, love human and divine,"
2123,IV.,"No atmosphere of real joy can be."""
2124,IV.,
2125,IV.,Not long the time mother and daughter needed
2126,IV.,"To don their simple, neat habiliments."
2127,IV.,A postman handed Percival a letter
2128,IV.,As they descended from the door to take
2129,IV.,The carriage that would bear them to the station;
2130,IV.,For they must go by rail some twenty miles
2131,IV.,To reach this paradise of Percival's.
2132,IV.,
2133,IV.,"When they were in the cars, and these in motion,"
2134,IV.,"Percival drew the letter from his pocket,"
2135,IV.,"And, while he read, a strange expression stole"
2136,IV.,"Over his features. ""Now what is it, father?"""
2137,IV.,Then with a sigh which her quick ear detected
2138,IV.,"As one that masked a pleasurable thought,"
2139,IV.,"He said: ""Poor little Linda!""--""And why poor?"""
2140,IV.,"""Because she will not be so rich again"
2141,IV.,In wishes unfulfilled. That grand piano
2142,IV.,"You saw at Chickering's--what was the price?"""
2143,IV.,"""Twelve hundred dollars only.""--""It is yours!"
2144,IV.,That painting you admired so--that by Church--
2145,IV.,"What did they ask for it?""--""Two thousand dollars."""
2146,IV.,"""'Tis cheap at that. We'll take it. Whose turn-out"
2147,IV.,"Was it that struck your fancy?""--""Miss Van Hagen's!"""
2148,IV.,"""Well, you shall have one like it, only better."
2149,IV.,"Look! What a charming cottage! How it stands,"
2150,IV.,"Fronting the water, flanked by woods and gardens!"
2151,IV.,"For sale, I see. We'll buy it. No, that house"
2152,IV.,Yonder upon the hill would suit us better;
2153,IV.,"Our coachman's family shall have the cottage."""
2154,IV.,
2155,IV.,"""What is it all, my father? You perplex me,"""
2156,IV.,"Said Linda, with a smile of anxious wonder."
2157,IV.,"""In brief, my little girl,"" said Percival,"
2158,IV.,"""You're grown to be an heiress. Let your mother"
2159,IV.,"Take in that letter. Read it to her, Linda."""
2160,IV.,It was a letter from executors
2161,IV.,"Of the late Arthur Kenrick, making known"
2162,IV.,That in his several large bequests was one
2163,IV.,"Of a full million, all to Percival."
2164,IV.,The mother's heart flew to the loved ones gone;
2165,IV.,"She sighed, but not to have them back again;"
2166,IV.,That were a wish too selfish and profane.
2167,IV.,"And then, the first surprise at length allayed,"
2168,IV.,"Calmly, but not without a natural joy"
2169,IV.,"At being thus lifted to an affluent lot,"
2170,IV.,The three discussed their future. Should they travel?
2171,IV.,"Or should they choose some rural site, and build?"
2172,IV.,Paradise Found would furnish a good site!
2173,IV.,Now they could help how many! Not aloof
2174,IV.,From scenes of destitution had they kept:
2175,IV.,What joy to aid the worthy poor! To save
2176,IV.,This one from beggary! To give the means
2177,IV.,"To that forsaken widow, overworked,"
2178,IV.,"With her persistent cough, to make a trip,"
2179,IV.,"She and her children, city-pinched and pale,"
2180,IV.,"To some good inland farm, and there recruit!"
2181,IV.,Many the plans for others they conceived!
2182,IV.,Many the joyful--
2183,IV.,
2184,IV.,Ah! a shivering crash!
2185,IV.,A whirl of splintered wood and loosened iron!
2186,IV.,Then shrieks and groans of pain....
2187,IV.,
2188,IV.,A broken rail
2189,IV.,Had done it all. Now for the killed and wounded!
2190,IV.,Ghastly the spectacle! And happy those
2191,IV.,Whom Death had taken swiftly! Linda's mother
2192,IV.,"Was one of these--a smile upon her lips,"
2193,IV.,But her breast marred--peacefully she had passed.
2194,IV.,"Percival's wound was mortal, but he strove,"
2195,IV.,"Amid the jar of sense, to fix his mind"
2196,IV.,On one absorbing thought--a thought for Linda:
2197,IV.,"For she, though stunned, they told him, would survive,"
2198,IV.,"Motherless, though--soon to be fatherless!"
2199,IV.,"And something--ah! what was it?--must be done,"
2200,IV.,"Done, too, at once. ""O gentlemen, come here!"
2201,IV.,"Paper and pen and ink! Quick, quick, I pray you!"
2202,IV.,No matter! Come! A pencil--that will do.
2203,IV.,Help me to make a will--I do bequeathe--
2204,IV.,Where am I? What has happened? God be with me!
2205,IV.,"Yes, I remember now--the will! the will!"
2206,IV.,No matter for the writing! Witness ye
2207,IV.,"That I bequeathe, convey, and hereby give"
2208,IV.,"To this my only child, named Linda--Linda--"
2209,IV.,God! What's my name? Where was I? Percival
2210,IV.,To Linda Percival--Is this a dream?
2211,IV.,What would I do? My heart is drowned in blood.
2212,IV.,"God help me. Linda--Linda!"""
2213,IV.,
2214,IV.,Then he died;
2215,IV.,"And, chasing from his face that glare of anguish,"
2216,IV.,Came a smile beatific as if angels
2217,IV.,Had soothed his fears and hushed him into calm.
2218,IV.,
2219,IV.,"Her father's cry was all unheard by Linda,"
2220,IV.,Or by her mortal senses all unheard.
2221,IV.,"Perhaps a finer faculty, removed"
2222,IV.,"From the external consciousness afar,"
2223,IV.,Took it all in; for when she woke at last
2224,IV.,"To outward life, and looking round beheld"
2225,IV.,"No sign of either parent, she sank back"
2226,IV.,"Into a trance, and lay insensible"
2227,IV.,For many hours. Then rallying she once more
2228,IV.,Seemed conscious; and observing the kind looks
2229,IV.,Of an old woman and a man whose brow
2230,IV.,"Of thought contrasted with his face of youth,"
2231,IV.,"She calmly said: ""Don't fear to tell me all;"
2232,IV.,I think I know it all; an accident
2233,IV.,With loss of life; my father and my mother
2234,IV.,Among--among the killed. Enough! Your silence
2235,IV.,Explains it now. So leave me for a while.
2236,IV.,"Should I need help, I'll call. You're very good."""
2237,IV.,
2238,IV.,"When they returned, Linda was sitting up"
2239,IV.,Against the pillow of the bed; her hands
2240,IV.,Folded upon her breast; her open eyes
2241,IV.,"Tearless and glazed, as if celestial scenes,"
2242,IV.,"Clear to the inner, nulled the outer vision."
2243,IV.,"The man drew near, touched her upon the brow,"
2244,IV.,"And said, ""My name is Henry Meredith."""
2245,IV.,"She started, and, as on an April sky"
2246,IV.,"A cloud is riven, and through the sudden cleft"
2247,IV.,"The sunshine darts, even so were Linda's eyes"
2248,IV.,"Flooded with conscious lustre, and she woke."
2249,IV.,
2250,IV.,It was a neatly furnished cottage room
2251,IV.,"In which she lay, and nodding eglantine,"
2252,IV.,"With its sweet-scented foliage and rath roses,"
2253,IV.,Rustled and shimmered at the open window.
2254,IV.,"""How long have I been lying here?"" asked Linda."
2255,IV.,"""Almost two days,"" said Meredith.--""Indeed!"
2256,IV.,"I read, sir, what you'd ask me, in your looks;"
2257,IV.,"And to the question on your mind I answer,"
2258,IV.,"If all is ready, let the funeral be"
2259,IV.,"This afternoon. Ay, in the village ground"
2260,IV.,Let their remains be laid. The services
2261,IV.,"May be as is convenient."" ""Of what faith"
2262,IV.,"Were they?""--""The faith of Christ.""--""But that is vague."
2263,IV.,The faith of Christ?  Mean you the faith _in_ Christ?
2264,IV.,"Faith in the power and need of his atonement?"""
2265,IV.,
2266,IV.,"""All that I mean is, that they held the faith"
2267,IV.,"Which was the faith of Christ, as manifest"
2268,IV.,"In his own words, unwrenched by others' words."
2269,IV.,So to no sect did they attach themselves;
2270,IV.,But from all sects drew all the truth they could
2271,IV.,In charity; believing that when Christ
2272,IV.,"Said of the pure in heart, 'They shall see God,'"
2273,IV.,He meant it; spoke no fragment of a truth;
2274,IV.,"Deferred no saying, qualifying that;"
2275,IV.,Set no word-trap for unsuspecting souls;
2276,IV.,"Spoke no oracular, ambiguous phrase,"
2277,IV.,Intending merely the vicarious pure;
2278,IV.,Reserved no strange or mystical condition
2279,IV.,"To breed fine points of doctrine, or confound"
2280,IV.,The simple-minded and the slow of faith.
2281,IV.,"Heart-purity and singleness and love,"
2282,IV.,"Fertile in loving acts, sole proof of these,"
2283,IV.,"Summed up for them, my father and my mother,"
2284,IV.,"All nobleness, all duty, all salvation,"
2285,IV.,"And all religion."""
2286,IV.,
2287,IV.,With a heavy sigh
2288,IV.,"Meredith turned away. ""I'll not discuss"
2289,IV.,"Things of such moment now,"" said he. ""One rock,"
2290,IV.,"One only rock, amid the clashing waves"
2291,IV.,"Of human error, have I found,--the rock"
2292,IV.,"On which Christ built his Church. Heaven show you it!"""
2293,IV.,"""Heaven show me truth! let it be on the rock,"
2294,IV.,"Or in the sand. You'll say Amen to that?"""
2295,IV.,"""I say Amen to what the Church approves,"
2296,IV.,"For I myself am weak and fallible,"
2297,IV.,"Depraved by nature, reprobate and doomed,"
2298,IV.,And ransomed only by the atoning blood
2299,IV.,Of a Redeemer more divine than human.
2300,IV.,But controversy is not timely now:
2301,IV.,"The papers, jewels, money, and what clothes"
2302,IV.,"Could properly be taken, you will find"
2303,IV.,In a small trunk of which this is the key.
2304,IV.,"At three o'clock the carriage will be ready."""
2305,IV.,
2306,IV.,"Linda put forth her hand; he gravely took it,"
2307,IV.,"And holding it in both of his the while,"
2308,IV.,"Said: ""Should you lack a friend, remember me."
2309,IV.,I was a witness to your father's death.
2310,IV.,Your mother must have died without a pang.
2311,IV.,"He, by a strenuous will, kept death at bay"
2312,IV.,"A minute, and his dying cry was Linda!"
2313,IV.,"Hardly can he have felt his sufferings,"
2314,IV.,"Such the intentness of his thought for you!"""
2315,IV.,"The fount of tears was happily struck at last,"
2316,IV.,And Linda wept profusely. Meredith
2317,IV.,Quitted the room; but the old woman sat
2318,IV.,"Beside the bed, her thin and shrunken fingers"
2319,IV.,"Hiding themselves in Linda's locks of gold,"
2320,IV.,Or with a soothing motion parting them
2321,IV.,From a brow fine and white as alabaster.
2322,IV.,"At length, like a retreating thunder-storm,"
2323,IV.,"The sobs grew faint and fainter, and then ceased."
2324,IV.,
2325,IV.,"After a pause, said Linda to the lady,"
2326,IV.,"""Is he your grandson?""--""Ay, my only one;"
2327,IV.,"A noble youth, heir to a splendid fortune;"
2328,IV.,"A scholar, too, and such a gentleman!"
2329,IV.,"Young; ay, not twenty-four! What a career,"
2330,IV.,"Would he but choose! Society is his,"
2331,IV.,"To cull from as he would. He throws by all,"
2332,IV.,"To be a poor tame priest, and take confessions"
2333,IV.,Of petty scandals and delinquencies
2334,IV.,"From a few Irish hussies and old women!"""
2335,IV.,"""We all,"" said Linda, ""hear the voice of duty"
2336,IV.,"In different ways, and many not at all."
2337,IV.,Honor to him who heeds the sacred claim
2338,IV.,At any cost of life's amenities
2339,IV.,And tenderest ties! We see the sacrifice;--
2340,IV.,We cannot reckon up the nobleness
2341,IV.,"It called for, and must call for to the end."""

2349,LINDA.,
2350,LINDA.,
2351,LINDA.,The news of the great railroad accident
2352,LINDA.,"And of the sudden death of Percival,"
2353,LINDA.,Coming so soon upon intelligence
2354,LINDA.,Of his rare fortune in the legacy
2355,LINDA.,"From Kenrick, occupied the public mind"
2356,LINDA.,"For a full day at least, and then was whelmed"
2357,LINDA.,In other marvels rushing thick upon it.
2358,LINDA.,"The mother and the daughter, who still bore"
2359,LINDA.,"The name of Percival, came back from Paris"

2363,LINDA.,"To her so full of sacred memories,"
2364,LINDA.,She was accosted by an officer
2365,LINDA.,Who told her he had put his seal on all
2366,LINDA.,"The papers, plate, and jewelry belonging"
2367,LINDA.,"To the late Albert Percival,--and asked"
2368,LINDA.,"If in her keeping were a watch and ring,"
2369,LINDA.,"Also some money, found upon his person:"
2370,LINDA.,"If so, would she please give them up, and he,"
2371,LINDA.,"Who had authority to take them, would"
2372,LINDA.,"Sign a receipt for all such property,"
2373,LINDA.,And then the rightful heir could easily
2374,LINDA.,"Dispose of it, as might seem best to her."
2375,LINDA.,
2376,LINDA.,"""The rightful heir?"" gasped Linda, taking in"
2377,LINDA.,"Not readily the meaning of the words,--"
2378,LINDA.,"""Do you not know that I'm the rightful heir"
2379,LINDA.,"And only child of Albert Percival?"""
2380,LINDA.,"""Pardon me,"" said the officer, ""the child,"
2381,LINDA.,"Recognized by the law, is not yourself,"
2382,LINDA.,"But Harriet Percival, the only heir,--"
2383,LINDA.,"For so the court adjudges,--and to her"
2384,LINDA.,"All property, both personal and real,"
2385,LINDA.,"Must be made over. She, no doubt, will deal"
2386,LINDA.,"Kindly in your peculiar case, and make"
2387,LINDA.,"A suitable provision--"""
2388,LINDA.,
2389,LINDA.,"""Hold!"" cried Linda,"
2390,LINDA.,Her nostrils' action showing generous blood
2391,LINDA.,As clearly as some matchless courser shows it
2392,LINDA.,"After a mighty race,--""Your business,"
2393,LINDA.,"But not your comments! And yet, pardon me--"
2394,LINDA.,"I'm hasty,--you meant well; but you would have me"
2395,LINDA.,Render you up the watch and pocket-book
2396,LINDA.,"Found on my father's person, and delivered"
2397,LINDA.,"To me his daughter. That I'll only do,"
2398,LINDA.,When more authority than you have shown
2399,LINDA.,"Compels me, and my lawyer bids me yield."""
2400,LINDA.,"""Here is my warrant,"" said the officer,"
2401,LINDA.,"""And my instructions are explicit."" Then,"
2402,LINDA.,The spirit of the gentleman disdaining
2403,LINDA.,"The action he was sent for, he rejoined:"
2404,LINDA.,"""But the law's letter shall not make me do"
2405,LINDA.,"An incivility, perhaps a wrong."
2406,LINDA.,"And so, relying on your truth, I leave you,"
2407,LINDA.,Assured that you'll be ready to respond
2408,LINDA.,"To all the law can ask. And now, good day!"""
2409,LINDA.,
2410,LINDA.,"Left to her own decisions, Linda sought"
2411,LINDA.,At once the best advice; and such had been
2412,LINDA.,"Her training, that she was not ignorant"
2413,LINDA.,Who among counsellors were trusted most
2414,LINDA.,In special ways. Kindly and patiently
2415,LINDA.,Her case was taken up and thoroughly
2416,LINDA.,Sifted and tried. No hope! No flaw! No case!
2417,LINDA.,"So craftily had every step been taken,"
2418,LINDA.,"With such precaution and such legal care,--"
2419,LINDA.,"So diligently had the mesh been woven,"
2420,LINDA.,"Enclosing Percival and all of his,--"
2421,LINDA.,That nothing could be done except put off
2422,LINDA.,The payment of the Kenrick legacy
2423,LINDA.,"For some six months,--when it was all made over"
2424,LINDA.,"To the reputed child, already rich"
2425,LINDA.,Through the law's disposition of the sums
2426,LINDA.,Which Percival had been compelled to pay.
2427,LINDA.,
2428,LINDA.,"After the legal test, with brave composure"
2429,LINDA.,"Linda surveyed her lot. Enough was left,"
2430,LINDA.,"From sale of jewels that had been her mother's,"
2431,LINDA.,"For a few months' support, with frugal care."
2432,LINDA.,Claim to these jewels and the money found
2433,LINDA.,Upon her mother's person had been laid
2434,LINDA.,"Too eagerly by the contesting party,"
2435,LINDA.,"Who said that Percival, in dying last,"
2436,LINDA.,Was heir to the effects; but since the claim
2437,LINDA.,"Could only be upheld by proving marriage,"
2438,LINDA.,The claimants sorrowfully gave it up.
2439,LINDA.,
2440,LINDA.,One day as Linda stood with folded hands
2441,LINDA.,"Before her easel, on which lay a painting"
2442,LINDA.,"Of flowers autumnal, grouped with rarest skill,--"
2443,LINDA.,"The blue-fringed gentian, the red cardinal,"
2444,LINDA.,"With fern and plumy golden-rod intwined,--"
2445,LINDA.,"A knock aroused her, and the opened door"
2446,LINDA.,"Disclosed a footman, clad in livery,"
2447,LINDA.,"Who, hat in hand, asked if a lady might"
2448,LINDA.,"Come up to see the pictures. ""Certainly,"""
2449,LINDA.,"Was the reply; and, panting up the stairs,"
2450,LINDA.,A lady came whose blazonry of dress
2451,LINDA.,"And air of self-assured, aggressive wealth"
2452,LINDA.,Spoke one well pleased to awe servility.
2453,LINDA.,
2454,LINDA.,As when by some forecasting sense the dove
2455,LINDA.,"Knows that the hawk, though out of sight and still,"
2456,LINDA.,"Is hovering near, even so did Linda feel"
2457,LINDA.,"An enemy draw nigh; felt that this woman,"
2458,LINDA.,"Who, spite of marks a self-indulgent life"
2459,LINDA.,"Leaves on the face, showed vestiges of beauty,"
2460,LINDA.,Was she who first had cast the bitterness
2461,LINDA.,Into that cup of youth which Linda's father
2462,LINDA.,Was made to taste so long.
2463,LINDA.,
2464,LINDA.,"And yet (how strangely,"
2465,LINDA.,"In this mixed web of life, the strands of good"
2466,LINDA.,Cross and inweave the evil!) to that wrong
2467,LINDA.,"Might he have tracked a joy surpassing hope,--"
2468,LINDA.,"The saving angel who, in Linda's mother,"
2469,LINDA.,Had so enriched his being;--might have tracked
2470,LINDA.,"(Mysterious thought!) Linda herself, his child,"
2471,LINDA.,"The crown of every rapture, every hope"
2472,LINDA.,
2473,LINDA.,"The lady, known as Madame Percival,"
2474,LINDA.,Seated herself and turned a piercing look
2475,LINDA.,"On Linda, who blenched not, but stood erect,"
2476,LINDA.,With calm and serious look regarding her.
2477,LINDA.,The lady was the first to lower her eyes;
2478,LINDA.,"She then, with some embarrassment, remarked:"
2479,LINDA.,"""So! you're an artist! Will you let me see"
2480,LINDA.,"Some of your newest paintings?"" Linda placed"
2481,LINDA.,"Three of her choicest pieces on the easel,"
2482,LINDA.,"And madame raised her eyeglass, looked a moment,"
2483,LINDA.,"Said, ""Very pretty,"" and then, breaking through"
2484,LINDA.,"Further constraint, began: ""You may not know me;"
2485,LINDA.,"My name is Percival; you, I suppose,"
2486,LINDA.,Bear the same name by courtesy. 'Tis well:
2487,LINDA.,The law at last has taught you possibly
2488,LINDA.,Our relative positions. Of the past
2489,LINDA.,We will say nothing; no hard thought is left
2490,LINDA.,Against you in my heart; I trust I know
2491,LINDA.,The meaning of forgiveness; what is due
2492,LINDA.,"To Christian charity. In me, although"
2493,LINDA.,"The church has but a frail, unworthy child,"
2494,LINDA.,Yet would I help my enemy; remove her
2495,LINDA.,"From doubtful paths, and see her fitly placed"
2496,LINDA.,With her own kindred for protection due.
2497,LINDA.,"Hear my proposal now, in your behalf:"
2498,LINDA.,"If you will go to England, where your aunts"
2499,LINDA.,"And relatives reside,--and first will sign"
2500,LINDA.,"A paper promising you'll not return,"
2501,LINDA.,"And that you never will resume your suit,--"
2502,LINDA.,"I will advance your passage-money, and"
2503,LINDA.,"Give you five thousand dollars. Will you do it?"""
2504,LINDA.,
2505,LINDA.,"The indignant No, surging in Linda's heart,"
2506,LINDA.,"Paused as if language were too weak for it,"
2507,LINDA.,"When, in that pause, the opening of the door"
2508,LINDA.,"Disclosed a lady younger than the first,"
2509,LINDA.,"Yet not unlike in features, though no blonde,"
2510,LINDA.,And of a figure small and delicate.
2511,LINDA.,"""Now, Harriet!"" cried the elder of the two,"
2512,LINDA.,"Annoyed, if not alarmed, ""you promised me"
2513,LINDA.,"You would not quit the carriage.""--""Well, what then?"
2514,LINDA.,I changed my mind. Is that a thing uncommon?
2515,LINDA.,Whom have we here? The name upon the door
2516,LINDA.,Is Percival; and there upon the wall
2517,LINDA.,I see a likeness of my father. So!
2518,LINDA.,"You, then, are Linda Percival! the child"
2519,LINDA.,"For whom he could abandon me, his first!"
2520,LINDA.,"Come, let me look at you!""--""Nay, Harriet,"
2521,LINDA.,This should not be. Come with me to the carriage;
2522,LINDA.,"Come! I command you.""--""Pooh! And pray, who cares"
2523,LINDA.,For your commands? I move not till I please.
2524,LINDA.,"We are half-sisters, Linda, but I hate you."""
2525,LINDA.,
2526,LINDA.,"""Excuse me,"" Linda answered quietly,"
2527,LINDA.,"""But I see no resemblance to my father"
2528,LINDA.,"In you. Your features, form, complexion, all"
2529,LINDA.,"Are quite unlike.""--""Silence! We've had enough."""
2530,LINDA.,"""What did she say?"" cried Harriet. ""Do not heed"
2531,LINDA.,"A word of hers; leave her and come with me."""
2532,LINDA.,"""She said, I bear no likeness to my father:"
2533,LINDA.,"You heard her!""--""'Twas in malice, Harriet."
2534,LINDA.,"Of course she would say that.""--""But I must have"
2535,LINDA.,That photograph of him upon the wall:
2536,LINDA.,"'Tis unlike any that I've ever seen."""
2537,LINDA.,And with the word she took it from the nail
2538,LINDA.,"And would have put it in her pocket, had not"
2539,LINDA.,"Linda, with sudden grasp, recovered it."
2540,LINDA.,
2541,LINDA.,"Darker her dark face grew, when Harriet"
2542,LINDA.,Saw herself baffled; taking out her purse
2543,LINDA.,"She drew from it a thousand-dollar bill,"
2544,LINDA.,"And said, ""Will this procure it?""--""Harriet!"
2545,LINDA.,"You're mad to offer such a sum as that."""
2546,LINDA.,"""Old woman, if you anger me, you'll rue it!"
2547,LINDA.,"I ask you, Linda Percival, if you"
2548,LINDA.,"Will take two thousand dollars for that portrait?"""
2549,LINDA.,"And Linda answered: ""I'll not take your money:"
2550,LINDA.,The portrait you may have without a price;
2551,LINDA.,"I'm not without a copy.""--""Well, I take it;"
2552,LINDA.,But mark you this: I shall not hate you less
2553,LINDA.,"For this compliance; nay, shall hate you more;"
2554,LINDA.,"For I do hate you with a burning hatred,"
2555,LINDA.,"And all the more for that smooth Saxon face,"
2556,LINDA.,With its clear red and white and Grecian outline;
2557,LINDA.,"That likeness to my father (I can see it),"
2558,LINDA.,Those golden ringlets and that rounded form.
2559,LINDA.,"Pray, Madame Percival, where did I get"
2560,LINDA.,"This swarthy hue, since Linda is so fair,"
2561,LINDA.,And you are far from being a quadroon?
2562,LINDA.,"Good lady, solve the riddle, if you please."""
2563,LINDA.,
2564,LINDA.,"""There! No more idle questions! Two o'clock?"
2565,LINDA.,"That camel's hair at Stewart's will be sold,"
2566,LINDA.,Unless we go this minute. Such a bargain!
2567,LINDA.,"Come, my dear, come!"" And so, cajoling, coaxing,"
2568,LINDA.,"She drew away her daughter, and the door"
2569,LINDA.,Closed quickly on the two. But Linda stood
2570,LINDA.,"In meditation rapt, as thought went back"
2571,LINDA.,To the dear parents who had sheltered her;
2572,LINDA.,Contrasting their ingenuous love sincere
2573,LINDA.,"And her own filial reverence, with the scene"
2574,LINDA.,She just had witnessed. So absorbed she was
2575,LINDA.,"In visions of the past, she did not heed"
2576,LINDA.,"The opening of the door, until a voice"
2577,LINDA.,"Broke in upon her tender revery,"
2578,LINDA.,"Saying, ""I've come again to get your answer"
2579,LINDA.,"To my proposal."" Tranquillized, subdued"
2580,LINDA.,"By those dear, sacred reminiscences,"
2581,LINDA.,"Linda, with pity in her tone, replied:"
2582,LINDA.,"""Madame, I cannot entertain your offer."""
2583,LINDA.,"""And why not, Linda Percival?"" exclaimed"
2584,LINDA.,"The imperious lady.--""I'm not bound to give"
2585,LINDA.,"My reasons, madame.""--""Come, I'll make the sum"
2586,LINDA.,"Ten thousand dollars.""--""Money could not alter"
2587,LINDA.,"My mind upon the subject.""--""Look you, Linda;"
2588,LINDA.,"You saw my daughter. Obstinate, self-willed,"
2589,LINDA.,"Passionate as a wild-cat, jealous, crafty,"
2590,LINDA.,Reckless in use of money when her whims
2591,LINDA.,"Are to be gratified, and yet at times"
2592,LINDA.,"Sordid as any miser,--she'll not stop"
2593,LINDA.,"At artifice, or violence, or crime,"
2594,LINDA.,To injure one she hates--and you she hates!
2595,LINDA.,"Now for your sake and hers, I charge you leave"
2596,LINDA.,"This country, go to England;--close at once"
2597,LINDA.,"With my most liberal offer."""
2598,LINDA.,
2599,LINDA.,"""Madame, no!"
2600,LINDA.,"This is my home, my birthplace, and the land"
2601,LINDA.,"Of all my efforts, hopes, and aspirations;"
2602,LINDA.,"While I have work to do, here lies my field:"
2603,LINDA.,"I cannot quit America. Besides,"
2604,LINDA.,"Since candor now is best, I would not take"
2605,LINDA.,"A dole from you to save myself from starving."""
2606,LINDA.,The lady's eyes flashed choler. She replied:
2607,LINDA.,"""Go your own gait; and, when you're on the street,"
2608,LINDA.,"As you'll be soon, blame no one but yourself."
2609,LINDA.,I've done my part. Me no one can accuse
2610,LINDA.,Of any lack of charity or care.
2611,LINDA.,For three weeks more my offer shall hold good.
2612,LINDA.,"After that time, expect no further grace."""
2613,LINDA.,"And, with a frown which tried to be disdain,"
2614,LINDA.,"But which, rebuked and humbled, fell before"
2615,LINDA.,"The pitying candor of plain Innocence,"
2616,LINDA.,Out of the room she swept with all her velvet.
2617,LINDA.,
2618,LINDA.,These interviews had made our Linda feel
2619,LINDA.,How quite alone in the wide world she stood.
2620,LINDA.,"A letter came, after her parents' death,"
2621,LINDA.,"From her aunt, Mrs. Hammersley, requesting"
2622,LINDA.,"A loan of fifty pounds, and telling all"
2623,LINDA.,The family distresses and shortcomings:
2624,LINDA.,How this one's husband had proved not so rich
2625,LINDA.,As was expected; how another's was
2626,LINDA.,"A tyrant and a niggard, so close-fisted"
2627,LINDA.,He parcelled out with his own hands the sugar
2628,LINDA.,"For kitchen use; and how another's still,"
2629,LINDA.,"Though amply able to receive their mother,"
2630,LINDA.,"A widow now, had yet refused to do it,"
2631,LINDA.,And even declined to make a contribution
2632,LINDA.,For her support. And so the gossip ran.
2633,LINDA.,The picture was not pleasant. With a sigh
2634,LINDA.,"Not for herself, but others, Linda penned"
2635,LINDA.,"A letter to her aunt, relating all"
2636,LINDA.,The events that made her powerless to aid
2637,LINDA.,"Her needy kinsfolk. She despatched the letter,"
2638,LINDA.,Then sat and thought awhile.
2639,LINDA.,
2640,LINDA.,"""And now for duty!"""
2641,LINDA.,"She cried, and rose. She could not think of duty"
2642,LINDA.,Except as something grateful to her parents.
2643,LINDA.,"They were a presence so securely felt,"
2644,LINDA.,"And so related to her every act,--"
2645,LINDA.,"Their love was still so vigilant, so real,"
2646,LINDA.,"That to do what, and only what, she knew"
2647,LINDA.,"They would approve, was duty paramount;"
2648,LINDA.,And their approval was the smile of God!
2649,LINDA.,"Self-culture, work, and needful exercise,--"
2650,LINDA.,This was her simple summing-up of duties
2651,LINDA.,"Immediately before her, and to be"
2652,LINDA.,Fulfilled without more parleying or delay.
2653,LINDA.,She found that by the labor of a month
2654,LINDA.,"In painting flowers from nature, she could earn"
2655,LINDA.,Easily sixty dollars. This she did
2656,LINDA.,For two years steadily. Then came a change.
2657,LINDA.,"From some cause unexplained, her wild-flower sketches,"
2658,LINDA.,Which from their novelty and careful finish
2659,LINDA.,"At first had found a ready sale, were now"
2660,LINDA.,In less demand. Linda was not aware
2661,LINDA.,"That these elaborate works, to nature true,"
2662,LINDA.,"Had been so multiplied in copies, made"
2663,LINDA.,"By hand, or printed by the chromo art,"
2664,LINDA.,As to be sold at prices not one fifth
2665,LINDA.,As high as the originals had cost.
2666,LINDA.,Hence her own genius winged the storm and lent
2667,LINDA.,"The color to the cloud, that overhung"
2668,LINDA.,"Her prospect, late so hopeful and serene."
2669,LINDA.,
2670,LINDA.,"Now came her year of struggle! Narrow means,"
2671,LINDA.,"Discouragement, the haunting fear of debt!"
2672,LINDA.,"One summer day, a day reminding her"
2673,LINDA.,"Of days supremely beautiful, immortal,"
2674,LINDA.,"(Since hallowed by undying love and joy),"
2675,LINDA.,"A little girl, the step-child, much endeared,"
2676,LINDA.,Of a poor artisan who dwelt near by
2677,LINDA.,"On the same floor with Linda, came to her"
2678,LINDA.,"And said: ""You promised me, Miss Percival,"
2679,LINDA.,That some fine day you'd take me in the cars
2680,LINDA.,"Where I could see the grass and pluck the flowers."""
2681,LINDA.,"""Well, Rachel Aiken, we will go to-day,"
2682,LINDA.,"If you will get permission from your father,"""
2683,LINDA.,"Said Linda, longing for the woodland air."
2684,LINDA.,"Gladly the father gave consent; and so,"
2685,LINDA.,"Clad in her best, the little damsel sat,"
2686,LINDA.,"While Linda filled the luncheon-box, and made"
2687,LINDA.,The preparations needful.
2688,LINDA.,
2689,LINDA.,"""What is that?"""
2690,LINDA.,"Asked Rachel, pointing to an open drawer"
2691,LINDA.,In which a case of polished ebony
2692,LINDA.,"Glittered and caught the eye. ""A pistol-case!"""
2693,LINDA.,"""And is the pistol loaded?""--""I believe so."""
2694,LINDA.,"""And will you take it with you?""--""Well, my dear,"
2695,LINDA.,"I did not think to do so: would you have me?"""
2696,LINDA.,"""Yes, if we're going to the woods; for panthers"
2697,LINDA.,"Lurk in the woods, you know.""--""I'll take it, Rachel;"
2698,LINDA.,We call this a revolver. See! Four times
2699,LINDA.,"I can discharge it."" At a block of wood"
2700,LINDA.,She aimed and fired; then carefully reloaded
2701,LINDA.,"The piece, and put it in a hidden pocket."
2702,LINDA.,
2703,LINDA.,"Some ten miles from the city, at a place"
2704,LINDA.,"Rich in diversity of wood and water,"
2705,LINDA.,They left the cars. Rachel's delight was wild.
2706,LINDA.,Never was day so lovely! Never grass
2707,LINDA.,"So green! And O the flowers! ""Look, only look,"
2708,LINDA.,Miss Percival! What is it? Can I pluck
2709,LINDA.,"As many as I want?""--""Ay, that's a harebell."""
2710,LINDA.,"""And O, look here! This red and yellow flower!"
2711,LINDA.,"Tell me its name.""--""A columbine. It grows"
2712,LINDA.,In clefts of rocks. That's an anemone:
2713,LINDA.,We call it so because the leaves are torn
2714,LINDA.,So easily by the wind; for _anemos_
2715,LINDA.,"Is Greek for wind.""--""Oh! here's a buttercup!"
2716,LINDA.,"I know that well. Red clover, too, I know."
2717,LINDA.,Isn't the dandelion beautiful?
2718,LINDA.,"And O, Miss Percival, what flower is this?"""
2719,LINDA.,"""That's a wild rose.""--""What, does the rose grow wild?"
2720,LINDA.,But is not that delightful? A wild rose!
2721,LINDA.,And I can take as many as I want!
2722,LINDA.,I did not dream the country was so fine.
2723,LINDA.,How very happy must the children be
2724,LINDA.,Who live here all the time! 'Tis better far
2725,LINDA.,"Than any garden; for, Miss Percival,"
2726,LINDA.,"The flowers are here all free, and quite as pretty"
2727,LINDA.,"As garden flowers. O, hark! Did ever bird"
2728,LINDA.,"So sweetly sing?""--""That was a wood-thrush, dear."""
2729,LINDA.,"""O darling wood-thrush! Do not stop so soon!"
2730,LINDA.,"Look there, on that stone wall! What's that?""--""A squirrel."""
2731,LINDA.,"""Is that indeed a squirrel? Are you sure?"
2732,LINDA.,How I would like a nut to throw to him!
2733,LINDA.,"What are these little red things in the grass?"""
2734,LINDA.,"""Wild strawberries, my dear.""--""Wild strawberries!"
2735,LINDA.,"And can I eat them?""--""Yes, we'll take a plate"
2736,LINDA.,"And pick it full, and eat them with our dinner."""
2737,LINDA.,"""O, will not that be nice? Wild strawberries"
2738,LINDA.,"That we have picked ourselves!"""
2739,LINDA.,
2740,LINDA.,And so the day
2741,LINDA.,"Slid on to noon; and then, it being hot,"
2742,LINDA.,"They crossed a wall into a skirting wood,"
2743,LINDA.,And there sat down upon a rocky slab
2744,LINDA.,"Covered with dry brown needles of the pine,"
2745,LINDA.,And ate their dinner while the birds made music.
2746,LINDA.,"""'Tis a free concert, ours!"" said Rachel Aiken:"
2747,LINDA.,"""How nice this dinner! What an appetite"
2748,LINDA.,I'm having all at once! My father says
2749,LINDA.,That I must learn to eat: I soon could learn
2750,LINDA.,In such a place as this! I wish my father
2751,LINDA.,"Himself would eat; he works too hard, I fear;"
2752,LINDA.,He works in lead: and the lead makes him ill.
2753,LINDA.,See what nice clothes he buys me! I'm afraid
2754,LINDA.,"He pays for me more than he can afford,"
2755,LINDA.,Seeing he has a mother to support
2756,LINDA.,"And a blind sister; for, Miss Percival,"
2757,LINDA.,"I'm but his step-child, and my mother died"
2758,LINDA.,"Two years ago; then my half-sister died,"
2759,LINDA.,"His only little girl, and now he says"
2760,LINDA.,That I am all he has in the wide world
2761,LINDA.,"To love and cherish dearly,--all his treasure."
2762,LINDA.,What would I give if I could bring him here
2763,LINDA.,"To these sweet woods, away from lead and work!"""
2764,LINDA.,
2765,LINDA.,"So the child prattled. Then, the gay dessert"
2766,LINDA.,"Of berries being ended, Linda sat"
2767,LINDA.,"On the rock's slope, and peeled the mosses off"
2768,LINDA.,Or looked up through the branches of the pines
2769,LINDA.,"At the sky's blue, while Rachel played around."
2770,LINDA.,"From tree to tree, from flower to flower, the child"
2771,LINDA.,"Darted through leafy lanes, when, all at once,"
2772,LINDA.,A scream roused Linda.
2773,LINDA.,
2774,LINDA.,To her feet she sprang!
2775,LINDA.,Instinctively (but not without a shudder)
2776,LINDA.,She grasped the little pistol she had brought
2777,LINDA.,"At the child's prompting; from the rock ran down,"
2778,LINDA.,"And, at a sudden bend, encountered three"
2779,LINDA.,"Young lusty ruffians, while, a few rods off,"
2780,LINDA.,"Another lifted Rachel in his arms,"
2781,LINDA.,And to the thicker wood beyond moved on.
2782,LINDA.,The three stood side by side as if to bar
2783,LINDA.,"The path to Linda, and their looks meant mischief."
2784,LINDA.,"The lane was narrow. ""For your life, make way!"""
2785,LINDA.,"She cried, and raised the pistol. ""No, you don't"
2786,LINDA.,"Fool us by tricks like that!"" the foremost said:"
2787,LINDA.,"""And so, my lady--"" But before the word"
2788,LINDA.,"Was out there was a little puff of smoke,"
2789,LINDA.,"With an explosion, not encouraging,--"
2790,LINDA.,And on the turf the frightened caitiff lay.
2791,LINDA.,"Her road now clear, reckless of torn alpaca,"
2792,LINDA.,"Over the scattered branches Linda rushed,"
2793,LINDA.,"Till she drew near the leader of the gang,"
2794,LINDA.,"Who, stopping, drew a pistol with one hand,"
2795,LINDA.,"While with the other he held Rachel fast,"
2796,LINDA.,Placing her as a shield before his breast.
2797,LINDA.,
2798,LINDA.,But Linda did not waver. Dropping into
2799,LINDA.,The old position that her father taught her
2800,LINDA.,"When to the shooting-gallery they went,"
2801,LINDA.,"She fired. An oath, the cry of pain and rage,"
2802,LINDA.,"Told her she had not missed her aim,--the jaw"
2803,LINDA.,"The ruffian left exposed. One moment more,"
2804,LINDA.,Rachel was in her arms. Taking a path
2805,LINDA.,"Transverse, they hit the public road and entered"
2806,LINDA.,The railroad station as the train came in.
2807,LINDA.,"When they were safely seated, and the engine"
2808,LINDA.,"Began to throb and pant, a sudden pallor"
2809,LINDA.,"Spread over Linda's visage, and she veiled"
2810,LINDA.,"Her face and fainted; yet so quietly,"
2811,LINDA.,But one among the passengers observed it;
2812,LINDA.,"And he came up, and taking Rachel's place"
2813,LINDA.,Supported Linda; from a lady near
2814,LINDA.,"Borrowed some pungent salts restorative,"
2815,LINDA.,"And finding soon the sufferer was herself,"
2816,LINDA.,Gave Rachel back her seat and took his own.
2817,LINDA.,"But at the city station, when arrived,"
2818,LINDA.,"This gentleman came up, and bowing, said:"
2819,LINDA.,"""Here stands my private carriage; but to-day"
2820,LINDA.,"I need it not. Let my man take you home."""
2821,LINDA.,"Linda demurred. His firm will urged them in,"
2822,LINDA.,And she and Rachel all at once were riding
2823,LINDA.,With easy bowling motion down Broadway.
2824,LINDA.,
2825,LINDA.,The evening papers had this paragraph:
2826,LINDA.,"""In Baker's Woods this morning two young men"
2827,LINDA.,Were fired on by a female lunatic
2828,LINDA.,"Without a provocation, and one wounded."
2829,LINDA.,"The bullet was extracted. Dr. Payson,"
2830,LINDA.,"With his accustomed skill and promptitude,"
2831,LINDA.,Performed the operation; and the patient
2832,LINDA.,Is doing well. We learn the unhappy woman--
2833,LINDA.,"She had with her a child--is still at large."""
2834,LINDA.,"""I'm glad it was no worse,"" quoth Linda, smiling."
2835,LINDA.,"She kissed the pistol that had been her mother's,"
2836,LINDA.,"Wiped it, and reverently put it by."
2837,LINDA.,
2838,LINDA.,*       *       *       *       *
2839,LINDA.,
2840,LINDA.,Three summers and an autumn had rolled on
2841,LINDA.,Since the catastrophe that orphaned Linda.
2842,LINDA.,"Midwinter with its whirling snow had come,"
2843,LINDA.,"And, shivering through the snow-encumbered streets"
2844,LINDA.,"Of the great city, men and women went,"
2845,LINDA.,Stooping their heads to thwart the spiteful wind.
2846,LINDA.,"The sleigh-bells rang, boys hooted, and policemen"
2847,LINDA.,Told each importunate beggar to move on.
2848,LINDA.,"In a side street where Fashion late had dwelt,"
2849,LINDA.,But which the up-town movement now had left
2850,LINDA.,"A street for journeymen and small mechanics,"
2851,LINDA.,"Dress-makers, masons, farriers, and draymen,"
2852,LINDA.,A female figure might be seen to enter
2853,LINDA.,"A lodging-house, and passing up two flights"
2854,LINDA.,Unlock a door that showed a small apartment
2855,LINDA.,"Neat, with two windows looking on the rear,"
2856,LINDA.,"A small recess with a low, narrow bed,"
2857,LINDA.,"A sofa, a piano, and three chairs."
2858,LINDA.,"'Twas noon, but in the sky no cleft of blue"
2859,LINDA.,Flashed the soft love-light like a lifted lid.
2860,LINDA.,
2861,LINDA.,"Clad plainly was the lady we have followed,--"
2862,LINDA.,But with a certain grace no modiste's art
2863,LINDA.,"Could have contrived. Youthful she was, and yet"
2864,LINDA.,A gravity not pertinent to youth
2865,LINDA.,Gave to her face the pathos of that look
2866,LINDA.,Which a too early thoughtfulness imparts;
2867,LINDA.,"And this was Linda,--Linda little changed,"
2868,LINDA.,Though nearer by four years to womanhood
2869,LINDA.,Than when we parted from her in the shadow
2870,LINDA.,Of a great woe.
2871,LINDA.,Preoccupied she seemed
2872,LINDA.,"Now with some painful thought, and in a slow,"
2873,LINDA.,Half-automatic manner she replenished
2874,LINDA.,With scanty bits of coal her little stove;
2875,LINDA.,"Then, with a like absorbed, uncertain air,"
2876,LINDA.,"Threw off her cloak and bonnet, and sat down;"
2877,LINDA.,Motionless sat awhile till she drew forth
2878,LINDA.,"A pocket-book, and from it took a letter,"
2879,LINDA.,"And read these words: ""You guaranteed the debt:"
2880,LINDA.,"It now has run three months, and if to-morrow"
2881,LINDA.,"It is not paid, we must seek legal help."""
2882,LINDA.,A bill of wood and coal for Rachel's father--
2883,LINDA.,Some twenty dollars only! And yet Linda
2884,LINDA.,Saw not the way to pay it on the morrow.
2885,LINDA.,"He, the poor artisan, on whose account"
2886,LINDA.,"She had incurred the liability,"
2887,LINDA.,"Lay prostrate with a malady, his last,"
2888,LINDA.,"In the small room near by, with little Rachel"
2889,LINDA.,His only watcher. What could Linda do?
2890,LINDA.,"At length, with lips compressed, and up and down"
2891,LINDA.,Moving her head as if to give assent
2892,LINDA.,"To some resolve, now fixed, she took her seat"
2893,LINDA.,"At the piano,--from her childhood's days"
2894,LINDA.,"So tenderly endeared, and every chord"
2895,LINDA.,Vibrating to some memory of her mother!
2896,LINDA.,"""Old friend,""--she sighed; then thought awhile and sang."
2897,LINDA.,
2898,LINDA.,
2899,I.,I.
2900,I.,
2901,I.,"Help me, dear chords, help me to tell in song"
2902,I.,The grief that now must say to you Farewell!
2903,I.,No music like to yours can ease my heart.
2904,I.,
2905,II.,II.
2906,II.,
2907,II.,"An infant on her knee I struck your keys,"
2908,II.,And you made sweet my earliest lullaby:
2909,II.,From you I thought my requiem might come.
2910,II.,
2911,III.,III.
2912,III.,
2913,III.,"Hard is the pang of parting, but farewell!"
2914,III.,"Harder the shame would be, if help were not;"
2915,III.,"Go, but your tones shall thrill forevermore."
2916,III.,
2917,IV.,IV.
2918,IV.,
2919,IV.,"Farewell! And O my mother, dost thou hear?"
2920,IV.,Farewell! But not to thoughts forever dear.
2921,IV.,"Farewell, but not to love--but not to thee!"
2922,IV.,
2923,IV.,
2924,IV.,"When little Rachel, by her father sent,"
2925,IV.,"Came in to take her lesson the next day,"
2926,IV.,"Behold, no instrument was in the room!"
2927,IV.,"What could it mean? ""We must give up,"" said Linda,"
2928,IV.,"""Our music for a little while. Perhaps"
2929,IV.,"I soon shall have my dear piano back."""
2930,IV.,Then they went in to see the sufferer.
2931,IV.,"A smile lit up his face,--a grateful smile,"
2932,IV.,"That lent a beauty even to Disease,"
2933,IV.,"Pale, thin, and hollow-eyed:"
2934,IV.,
2935,IV.,"""Is not the air"
2936,IV.,"Quite harsh to-day?"" he asked. ""A searching air."""
2937,IV.,"""So I supposed. I find it hard to breathe."
2938,IV.,Dear lady--but you've been a friend indeed!
2939,IV.,In my vest-pocket you will find a wallet.
2940,IV.,All that I have is in it. Take and use it.
2941,IV.,A fellow-workman brought me yesterday
2942,IV.,"Fifty-two dollars, by my friends subscribed:"
2943,IV.,Take from it what will pay for coal and rent.
2944,IV.,To-morrow some one of my friends will come
2945,IV.,To see to what the morrow may require.
2946,IV.,"You've done so much, dear lady, I refrain"
2947,IV.,"From asking more.""--""Ask all that you would have."""
2948,IV.,"""My little Rachel--she will be alone,"
2949,IV.,"All, all alone in this wide, striving world:"
2950,IV.,An orphan child without a relative!
2951,IV.,Could you make interest to have her placed
2952,IV.,"In some asylum?""--""Do not doubt my zeal"
2953,IV.,Or my ability to have it done.
2954,IV.,"And should good fortune come to me, be sure"
2955,IV.,"Rachel shall have a pleasant home in mine."""
2956,IV.,"""That's best of all. Thank you. God help you both."
2957,IV.,"Now, Rachel, say the little prayer I taught you."
2958,IV.,... That was well said. Now kiss me for good night.
2959,IV.,That's a dear little girl! I'll tell your mother
2960,IV.,How good and diligent and kind you are;
2961,IV.,"How careful, too, of all your pretty clothes;"
2962,IV.,"And what a nurse you've been,--how true and tender."
2963,IV.,"Rachel, obey Miss Percival. Be quick"
2964,IV.,To shun all evil. Fly from heedless playmates.
2965,IV.,Close your young eyes on all impurity.
2966,IV.,Cast out all naughty thoughts by holy prayer.
2967,IV.,"Love only what is good. Ah! darling child,"
2968,IV.,"I hoped to shield you up to womanhood,"
2969,IV.,But God ordains it otherwise. May He
2970,IV.,Amid the world's thick perils be your Guide!
2971,IV.,"There! Do not cry, my darling. All is well."
2972,IV.,"Sing us some pious hymn, Miss Percival."""
2973,IV.,"And Linda, with wet eyelids, sang these words."
2974,IV.,
2975,IV.,
2976,I.,I.
2977,I.,
2978,I.,"Be of good cheer, O Soul!"
2979,I.,Angels are nigh;
2980,I.,"Evil can harm thee not,"
2981,I.,God hears thy cry.
2982,I.,
2983,II.,II.
2984,II.,
2985,II.,Into no void shalt thou
2986,II.,Spring from this clay;
2987,II.,His everlasting arm
2988,II.,Shall be thy stay.
2989,II.,
2990,III.,III.
2991,III.,
2992,III.,"Day hides the stars from thee,"
2993,III.,Sense hides the heaven
2994,III.,Waiting the contrite soul
2995,III.,That here has striven.
2996,III.,
2997,IV.,IV.
2998,IV.,
2999,IV.,Soon shall the glory dawn
3000,IV.,Making earth dim;
3001,IV.,"Be not disquieted,"
3002,IV.,Trust thou in Him!
3003,IV.,
3004,IV.,
3005,IV.,"""O, thank you! Every word is true--I know it."
3006,IV.,"Sense hides it now, but has not always hid."
3007,IV.,"Remember, Rachel, that I say it here,"
3008,IV.,Weighing my words: I know it all is true.
3009,IV.,"God bless you both. I'm very, very happy."
3010,IV.,"My pain is almost gone. I'll sleep awhile."""
3011,IV.,"Rachel and Linda sat an hour beside him,"
3012,IV.,Silently watching. Linda then arose
3013,IV.,And placed her hand above his heart: 'twas still.
3014,IV.,Tranquilly as the day-flower shuts its leaves
3015,IV.,"And renders up its fragrance to the air,"
3016,IV.,From the closed mortal senses had he risen.
3017,IV.,
3018,IV.,*       *       *       *       *
3019,IV.,
3020,IV.,One day the tempter sat at Linda's ear:
3021,IV.,Sat and discoursed--so piously! so wisely!
3022,IV.,She held a letter in her hand; a letter
3023,IV.,Signed Jonas Fletcher. Jonas was her landlord;
3024,IV.,"A man of forty--ay, a gentleman;"
3025,IV.,"Kind to his tenants, liberal, forbearing;"
3026,IV.,Rich and retired from active business;
3027,IV.,"A member of the Church, but tolerant;"
3028,IV.,"A man sincere, cordial, without a flaw"
3029,IV.,In habits or in general character;
3030,IV.,"Of comely person, too, and cheerful presence."
3031,IV.,"Long had he looked on Linda, and at last"
3032,IV.,"Had studied her intently; knew her ways,"
3033,IV.,"Her daily occupations; whom she saw,"
3034,IV.,And where she went. He had an interest
3035,IV.,"Beyond that of the landlord, in his knowledge;"
3036,IV.,The letter was an offer of his hand.
3037,IV.,Of Linda's parentage and history
3038,IV.,"He nothing knew, and nothing sought to know."
3039,IV.,"He took her as she was; was well content,"
3040,IV.,"With what he knew, to run all other risks."
3041,IV.,The letter was a good one and a frank;
3042,IV.,"It came to Linda in her pinch of want,"
3043,IV.,"Discouragement, and utter self-distrust."
3044,IV.,And thus the tempter spoke and she replied:
3045,IV.,
3046,IV.,"""You're getting thin; you find success in art"
3047,IV.,Is not a thing so easy as you fancied.
3048,IV.,Five years you've worked at what you modestly
3049,IV.,Esteem your specialty. Your specialty!
3050,IV.,"As if a woman could have more than one,--"
3051,IV.,And that--maternity! I do not speak
3052,IV.,Of the six years you gave your art before
3053,IV.,You strove to make it pay. Methinks you see
3054,IV.,Your efforts are a failure. What's the end
3055,IV.,Of all your toil? Not enough money saved
3056,IV.,For the redemption of your pawned piano!
3057,IV.,Truly a cheerful prospect is before you:
3058,IV.,"To hear your views would edify me greatly."""
3059,IV.,
3060,IV.,"""Yes, I am thinner than I was; but then"
3061,IV.,I can afford to be--so that's not much.
3062,IV.,As for success--if we must measure that
3063,IV.,"By the financial rule, 'tis small, I grant you."
3064,IV.,"Yes, I have toiled, and lived laborious days,"
3065,IV.,And little can I show in evidence;
3066,IV.,"And sometimes--sometimes, I am sick at heart,"
3067,IV.,And almost lose my faith in woman's power
3068,IV.,"To paint a rose, or even to mend a stocking,"
3069,IV.,"As well as man can do. What would you have?"""
3070,IV.,
3071,IV.,"""Now you speak reason. Let me see you act it!"
3072,IV.,"Abandon this wild frenzy of the hour,"
3073,IV.,That would leave woman free to go all ways
3074,IV.,"A man may go! Why, look you, even in art,"
3075,IV.,"Most epicene of all pursuits in life,"
3076,IV.,How man leaves woman always far behind!
3077,IV.,Give up your foolish striving; and let Nature
3078,IV.,"And the world's order have their way with you."""
3079,IV.,
3080,IV.,"""Small as the pittance is, yet I could earn"
3081,IV.,"More, ten times, by my brush than by my needle."""
3082,IV.,
3083,IV.,"""Ah! woman's sphere is that of the affections."
3084,IV.,"Ambition spoils her--spoils her as a woman."""
3085,IV.,
3086,IV.,"""Spoils her for whom?"""
3087,IV.,
3088,IV.,"""For man."""
3089,IV.,
3090,IV.,"""Then woman's errand"
3091,IV.,"Is not, like man's, self-culture, self-advancement,"
3092,IV.,But she must simply qualify herself
3093,IV.,To be a mate for man: no obligation
3094,IV.,Resting on man to qualify himself
3095,IV.,"To be a mate for woman?"""
3096,IV.,
3097,IV.,"""Ay, the man"
3098,IV.,Lives in the intellect; the woman's life
3099,IV.,"Is that of the affections, the emotions;"
3100,IV.,"And her anatomy is proof of it."""
3101,IV.,
3102,IV.,"""So have I often heard, but do not see."
3103,IV.,"Some women have I known, who could endure"
3104,IV.,Surgical scenes which many a strong man
3105,IV.,Would faint at. We have had this dubious talk
3106,IV.,Of woman's sphere far back as history goes:
3107,IV.,'Tis time now it were proved: let actions prove it;
3108,IV.,"Let free experience, education prove it!"
3109,IV.,Why is it that the vilest drudgeries
3110,IV.,"Are put on woman, if her sphere be that"
3111,IV.,"Of the affections only, the emotions?"
3112,IV.,"_He_ represents the intellect, and _she_"
3113,IV.,The affections only! Is it always so?
3114,IV.,"Let Malibran, or Mary Somerville,"
3115,IV.,"De Staël, Browning, Stanton, Stowe, Bonheur,"
3116,IV.,Stand forth as proof of that cool platitude.
3117,IV.,"Use other arguments, if me you'd move."
3118,IV.,"Besides, I see not that your system makes"
3119,IV.,Any provision for that numerous class
3120,IV.,"To whom the affections are an Eden closed,--"
3121,IV.,The women who are single and compelled
3122,IV.,To drudge for a precarious livelihood!
3123,IV.,What of _their_ sphere? What of the sphere of those
3124,IV.,"Who do not, by the sewing of a shirt,"
3125,IV.,"Earn a meal's cost? Go tell them, when they venture"
3126,IV.,On an employment social custom makes
3127,IV.,"Peculiarly a man's,--that they become"
3128,IV.,"Unwomanly! Go make them smile at that,--"
3129,IV.,"Smile if they've not forgotten how to smile."""
3130,IV.,
3131,IV.,"""I see that you're befogged, my little woman,"
3132,IV.,Chasing this ignis fatuus of the day!
3133,IV.,"Leave it, and settle down as woman should."
3134,IV.,"What has been always, must be to the end."
3135,IV.,Always has woman been subordinate
3136,IV.,"In mind, in body, and in power, to man."
3137,IV.,"Let rhetoricians rave, and theorists"
3138,IV.,"Spin their fine webs,--bow you to holy Nature,"
3139,IV.,"And plant your feet upon the eternal fact."""
3140,IV.,
3141,IV.,"""The little lifetime of the human race"
3142,IV.,You call--eternity! The other day
3143,IV.,One of these old eternal wrongs was ended
3144,IV.,Rather abruptly; yet good people thought
3145,IV.,'Twas impious to doubt it was eternal.
3146,IV.,"Because abuses have existed always,"
3147,IV.,May we not prove they are abuses still?
3148,IV.,"If for antiquity you plead, why not"
3149,IV.,"Tell us the harem is the rule of nature,"
3150,IV.,"The one solution of the woman problem?"""
3151,IV.,
3152,IV.,"""Does not St. Paul--"""
3153,IV.,
3154,IV.,"""Excuse me. Beg no questions."
3155,IV.,"St. Paul to you may be infallible,"
3156,IV.,"But Science is so unaccommodating,"
3157,IV.,"If not irreverent, she'll not accept"
3158,IV.,His ipse dixit as an axiom.
3159,IV.,"Here, in our civilized society,"
3160,IV.,Is an increasing host of single women
3161,IV.,Who do not find the means of livelihood
3162,IV.,In the employments you call feminine.
3163,IV.,What shall be done? And my reply is this:
3164,IV.,Let every honest calling be as proper
3165,IV.,For woman as for man; throw open all
3166,IV.,"Varieties of labor, skilled or rough,"
3167,IV.,To woman's choice and woman's competition.
3168,IV.,Let _her_ decide the question of the fitness.
3169,IV.,"Let her rake hay, or pitch it, if she'd rather"
3170,IV.,Do that than scrub a floor or wash and iron.
3171,IV.,"And, above all, let her equality"
3172,IV.,Be barred not at the ballot-box; endow her
3173,IV.,With all the rights a citizen can claim;
3174,IV.,Give her the suffrage;[7] let her have--by right
3175,IV.,And not by courtesy--a voice in shaping
3176,IV.,The laws and institutions of the land.
3177,IV.,"And then, if after centuries of trial,"
3178,IV.,"All shall turn out a fallacy, a failure,"
3179,IV.,The social scheme will readjust itself
3180,IV.,"On the old basis, and the world shall be"

3337,IV.,A light broke in on Linda. All at once
3338,IV.,The mystery that hung upon her strivings

3340,IV.,That all this while she had not weighed her talents
3341,IV.,In a false balance; had not been the dupe
3342,IV.,Of her own aspirations and desires.
3343,IV.,With eyes elate and hope up-springing fresh
3344,IV.,"In her glad heart, she cried, ""And are you sure?"""

3360,IV.,Was not so wholly irresistible

3363,IV.,
3364,IV.,"""Why, Miss Percival,"" said Rachel,"

3386,IV.,"Advanced to welcome her. The ""old man"" he,"
3387,IV.,"Of Brown's narration; not so very old,"
3388,IV.,"However; not quite thirty-five, in fact."
3389,IV.,The capital which made his note so good
3390,IV.,Was a bald head; a head you could not question;
3391,IV.,"A head which was a pledge of solvency,"
3392,IV.,A warrant of respectability!
3393,IV.,The scalp all glossy; tufts above the ears!
3394,IV.,"This head he cultivated carefully,"
3395,IV.,And always took his hat off when he went
3396,IV.,To ask a discount or to clinch a bargain.
3397,IV.,"""Ah! my young friend, Miss Percival,"" he cried,"
3398,IV.,"""You've something choice there, if I'm not mistaken."""

3402,IV.,An expression of surprise
3403,IV.,"Came to the ""old man's"" features; but he hid it"
3404,IV.,By making of his hand a cylinder
3405,IV.,"And looking through it, like a connoisseur."
3406,IV.,"These were his exclamations: ""Clever! Ay!"
3407,IV.,Style somewhat new; landscape a shade too bright;
3408,IV.,"The sky too blue, eh? Still a clever picture,--"
3409,IV.,"One of your best. Shall we say twenty dollars?"""
3410,IV.,"Taking the picture, Linda said, ""Good morning!"
3411,IV.,"I'm in a hurry now, and you'll excuse me."""
3412,IV.,"""Will you not leave it?""--""No, I'm not disposed"
3413,IV.,"To part with it at present.""--""Thirty dollars"

3415,IV.,"I'll call it thirty.""--""Could you not say fifty?"""
3416,IV.,"""You're joking with me now, Miss Percival."""
3417,IV.,"""Then we will end our pleasantry. Good by."""
3418,IV.,"""Stay! You want money: I shall be ashamed"

3422,IV.,
3423,IV.,"The ""old man"""
3424,IV.,"Lowered his head, so that the burnished scalp"
3425,IV.,Might strike her eye direct. Impenetrable

3427,IV.,"A hundred for it, I believe. Good day!"""
3428,IV.,"""Stop, stop! For some time our intent has been"
3429,IV.,To make you a small present as a proof

3431,IV.,"A hundred dollars for the picture. Well?"""
3432,IV.,"""Nay, I would rather not accept a favor."
3433,IV.,"I must go now,--will call again some day."""
3434,IV.,"Desperate the ""old man"" moved his head about"
3435,IV.,"In the most striking lights, and patted it"
3436,IV.,"Wildly at last, as if by that mute act"
3437,IV.,To stay the unrelenting fugitive.
3438,IV.,"In vain! She glided off, and Rachel with her."

3440,IV.,"Upon a lawyer for advice, my dear."""
3441,IV.,
3442,IV.,"Thoughtfully Diggin listened to the case,"

3448,IV.,"For I'm no judge of art. Fine points of law,"
3449,IV.,"Not fine points in a picture, have engaged"

3458,IV.,"First have it photographed, and then deposit"
3459,IV.,"The photographic copy with the Court."""
3460,IV.,
3461,IV.,"Then Diggin paced the room awhile, and ran"
3462,IV.,Through his lank hair his fingers nervously.
3463,IV.,At length his plan took shape; he stopped and said
3464,IV.,"""You shall take back your picture to this dealer;"
3465,IV.,"Tell him 'tis not for sale, but get his promise"
3466,IV.,"To have it, for a fortnight, well displayed"
3467,IV.,At his shop window. This he'll not refuse.
3468,IV.,Don't sell at any price. What's your address?
3469,IV.,Edward shall go with you: 'tis well to have
3470,IV.,A witness at this juncture. Write me down

3472,IV.,Now go; and if the picture is removed--
3473,IV.,For purposes we'll not anticipate--
3474,IV.,"As it will be--we'll corner the 'old man,'"
3475,IV.,"And his bald head sha'n't save him. By the way,"
3476,IV.,If you want money let me be your banker;

3479,IV.,
3480,IV.,"The picture was removed, as he foretold."
3481,IV.,Ten weeks went by; then Linda got it back.
3482,IV.,"""It is the pleasant season,"" said the lawyer;"
3483,IV.,"""Here are three hundred dollars. You start back!"
3484,IV.,"Miss Linda, I shall charge you ten per cent"

3508,IV.,"On the seat back of them, two gentlemen"

3521,IV.,His taste inclining him to art and letters.
3522,IV.,"But Lothian had a partner, Judd,--a scamp,"
3523,IV.,As the result made evident; and Judd
3524,IV.,"One day was missing; bonds, securities,"
3525,IV.,"And bills, deposits of confiding folk,"
3526,IV.,"Guardians, and widows, and old men retired,"
3527,IV.,All had been gobbled up by Judd--converted
3528,IV.,Into hard cash--and Judd had disappeared.
3529,IV.,Despair for Lothian! a man whose word
3530,IV.,No legal form could make more absolute.
3531,IV.,"Crushed, mortified, and rendered powerless,"
3532,IV.,He could not breast the storm. The mental strain
3533,IV.,"Threw him upon his bed, and there he lay"
3534,IV.,"Till Charles, from Italy in haste returning,"
3535,IV.,Found his old sire emaciate and half dead

3539,IV.,"He paid off all the liabilities,"
3540,IV.,And found himself without three thousand dollars

3542,IV.,"What shall we call him, imbecile or saint?"
3543,IV.,His plan is now to set up as a teacher.
3544,IV.,Of such a teacher let each thrifty father

3548,IV.,
3549,IV.,"Attracted by the story, Linda tried"
3550,IV.,"To get a sight of him, the simpleton;"
3551,IV.,"And, when she saw his face, it seemed to her"

3554,IV.,Of peering memory to fix the where
3555,IV.,And when of the encounter! Yet she knew
3556,IV.,That with it was allied a grateful thought.

3903,LINDA'S SONG.,He noticed Linda.
3904,LINDA'S SONG.,
3905,LINDA'S SONG.,"Then, as if relenting"
3906,LINDA'S SONG.,"In some resolve, he jumped from rock to rock"

3922,LINDA'S SONG.,Then the discourse slid off to woman's rights;
3923,LINDA'S SONG.,For Lothian held a newspaper which told
3924,LINDA'S SONG.,"Of some convention, the report of which"
3925,LINDA'S SONG.,"Might raise a smile. One of the lady speakers,"
3926,LINDA'S SONG.,"It seems, would give her sex the privilege"

3931,LINDA'S SONG.,"""Indeed, you almost take my breath away"
3932,LINDA'S SONG.,"With your Why not, Miss Percival! Why not?"""
3933,LINDA'S SONG.,"""Yes, I repeat,--if so disposed, why not?"
3934,LINDA'S SONG.,For why should woman any more than man
3935,LINDA'S SONG.,"Play the dissembler, with so much at stake?"
3936,LINDA'S SONG.,I know the ready taunt that here will rise:
3937,LINDA'S SONG.,'Already none too backward are our girls
3938,LINDA'S SONG.,In husband-seeking.' Seeking in what way?
3939,LINDA'S SONG.,"Seeking by stratagem and management,--"
3940,LINDA'S SONG.,"Not by frank, honest means! What food for mirth"
3941,LINDA'S SONG.,'Twould give to shallow men to see a woman
3942,LINDA'S SONG.,"Court the relation, intertwined with all"
3943,LINDA'S SONG.,"Of purest happiness that she may crave,--"
3944,LINDA'S SONG.,"The ties of wife and mother! O, what pointing,"
3945,LINDA'S SONG.,"Sneering, and joking! And yet why should care"
3946,LINDA'S SONG.,"Thoughtful and pure and wisely provident,"
3947,LINDA'S SONG.,"That Nature's sacred prompting shall not fail,"
3948,LINDA'S SONG.,"Be one thing for a man, and quite another"
3949,LINDA'S SONG.,"For her, the woman? Why this flimsy mask?"
3950,LINDA'S SONG.,"This playing of a part, put on to suit,"
3951,LINDA'S SONG.,"Not the heart's need, but Fashion custom-bound?"
3952,LINDA'S SONG.,"Feigning we must be sought, and never seek?"
3953,LINDA'S SONG.,"Now, through these social hindrances and bars,"

3958,LINDA'S SONG.,"A thought ignoble, and which no true woman"
3959,LINDA'S SONG.,"Should harbor for a moment. Give her freedom,"
3960,LINDA'S SONG.,"Freedom to seek, and she'll not harbor it!"
3961,LINDA'S SONG.,"Because if woman, equally with man,"
3962,LINDA'S SONG.,"Were privileged thus, she would discriminate"
3963,LINDA'S SONG.,"Much more than now, and fewer sordid unions"
3964,LINDA'S SONG.,Would be the sure result. For what if man
3965,LINDA'S SONG.,Were chained to singleness until some woman
3966,LINDA'S SONG.,"Might seek his hand in marriage, would he be"
3967,LINDA'S SONG.,Likely as now to make a wise election?
3968,LINDA'S SONG.,"Would he not say, 'Time flies; my chances lessen"

3970,LINDA'S SONG.,"True, there are mercenary men enough,"
3971,LINDA'S SONG.,"Seeking rich dowries; they'd find fewer dupes,"
3972,LINDA'S SONG.,"Were women free as men to seek and choose,"
3973,LINDA'S SONG.,"Banish the senseless inequality,"
3974,LINDA'S SONG.,And you make marriage less a vulgar game
3975,LINDA'S SONG.,In which one tries to circumvent the other.
3976,LINDA'S SONG.,"Oh! all this morbid ribaldry of _men_,"
3977,LINDA'S SONG.,"And all this passive imbecility,"
3978,LINDA'S SONG.,"And superstitious inactivity,"
3979,LINDA'S SONG.,"Dissimulation and improvidence,"
3980,LINDA'S SONG.,"False shame and lazy prejudice of _women_,"

4010,LINDA'S SONG.,Why should not woman seek her happiness
4011,LINDA'S SONG.,With brow as unabashed as man may wear
4012,LINDA'S SONG.,In seeking his? Ah! lack of candor here
4013,LINDA'S SONG.,"Works more regrets, for woman and for man,"
4014,LINDA'S SONG.,Than we can reckon. Let but woman feel
4015,LINDA'S SONG.,"That in the social scheme she's not a cipher,"

4020,LINDA'S SONG.,"Settled the point, even as the world has done?"""
4021,LINDA'S SONG.,"Said Linda: ""Instincts differ; they may be"
4022,LINDA'S SONG.,Results of shallow prejudice or custom.
4023,LINDA'S SONG.,The Turk will tell you that polygamy

4025,LINDA'S SONG.,"In dirty painted grandeur, while his squaw"
4026,LINDA'S SONG.,"Carries the burdens, might reply that instinct"
4027,LINDA'S SONG.,Regulates that. So instinct proves too much.
4028,LINDA'S SONG.,Queens and great heiresses are privileged
4029,LINDA'S SONG.,"To intimate their matrimonial choice,--"
4030,LINDA'S SONG.,Simply because superiority

4148,UNDER THE PINES.,With not a hoof-mark on the glistening plain.
4149,UNDER THE PINES.,"The horses tossed their heads with snorting pride,"
4150,UNDER THE PINES.,"Feeling the ocean breeze, as curved and fell"

4199,UNDER THE PINES.,"""Well; pleasant journey!""--""Thank you. Good by, Rachel."""
4200,UNDER THE PINES.,"He rode away, leading her panting horse;"

4216,UNDER THE PINES.,
4217,UNDER THE PINES.,"""What did I mean by speaking so?"" said Linda,"

4246,II.,It is the heart makes music musical!
4247,II.,My neighbor has a mocking-bird: its song
4248,II.,Has been as little heeded as the noise
4249,II.,Of rattling wheels incessant; but to-day
4250,II.,One of its strains brought all Elysium back
4251,II.,Into my heart. What was it? What the tie
4252,II.,Linking it with some inexpressive joy?
4253,II.,"At length I solve the mystery! Those notes,"
4254,II.,"Pensively slow and sadly exquisite,"
4255,II.,Were what the wood-thrush piped at early dawn
4256,II.,"After that evening passage in the boat,"
4257,II.,"When stars came out, that never more shall set."
4258,II.,Oh! sweet and clear the measured cadence fell
4259,II.,Upon my ear in slumber--and I woke!
4260,II.,"I woke, and listened while the first faint flush"
4261,II.,Of day was in the east; while yet the grove
4262,II.,"Showed only purple gloom, and on the beach"
4263,II.,The tidal waves with intermittent rush
4264,II.,Broke lazily and lent their mingling chime.
4265,II.,And O the unreckoned riches of the soul!
4266,II.,"The possible beatitudes, of which"
4267,II.,"A glimpse is given, a transitory glimpse,"
4268,II.,"So rarely in a lifetime! Then it was,"
4269,II.,"Hearing that strain, as if all joy the Past"
4270,II.,"Had in its keeping,--all the Future held,--"
4271,II.,"All love, all adoration, and all beauty,--"
4272,II.,"Made for a moment the soul's atmosphere,"
4273,II.,And lifted it to bliss unspeakable.
4274,II.,O splendor fugitive! O transport rare!
4275,II.,Transfiguring and glorifying life!

4280,III.,"This strange, inexplicable human heart!"

4283,III.,And for the first year only! We shall have
4284,III.,A big bill to send in; and do not fear

4286,III.,To escape the heavy damages the law
4287,III.,"Allows for such infringement, he'll be glad"
4288,III.,To compromise for the amount I fix;
4289,III.,And what I shall compel him to disgorge
4290,III.,Will simply be fair copyright on all

4292,III.,"Some fifteen thousand dollars, not to speak"

4294,III.,So writes my lawyer. Now one would suppose
4295,III.,"That news like this would make me light of heart,"
4296,III.,"Spur my ambition; and, as taste of blood"
4297,III.,"Fires the pet tiger, even so touch of gold"
4298,III.,Would rouse the sacred appetite of gain.
4299,III.,But with attainment cometh apathy;
4300,III.,"And I was somewhat happier, methinks,"
4301,III.,"When life was all a struggle, and the prayer,"
4302,III.,"""Give me my daily bread,"" had anxious meaning."
4303,III.,
4304,III.,
4305,IV.,IV.
4306,IV.,
4307,IV.,Is it then true that woman's proper sphere
4308,IV.,Is in the affections? that she's out of place
4309,IV.,"When these are balked, and science, art, or trade"
4310,IV.,Has won the dedication of her thought?
4311,IV.,"Nay! the affections are for all; and he,"
4312,IV.,"Or she, has most of life, who has them most."
4313,IV.,"O, not an attribute of sex are they!"
4314,IV.,"Heart loneliness is loneliness indeed,"
4315,IV.,"But not for woman any more than man,"
4316,IV.,"Were she so trained, her active faculties"
4317,IV.,Could have a worthy aim.
4318,IV.,
4319,IV.,"What worthier,"
4320,IV.,"Than the pursuit, the discipline of beauty?"
4321,IV.,He who finds beauty helps to interpret God:
4322,IV.,For not an irreligious heart can dwell
4323,IV.,In him who sees and knows the beautiful.
4324,IV.,I'll not believe that one whom Art has chosen
4325,IV.,"For a high priest can be irreverent,"
4326,IV.,"Sordid, unloving; his veil-piercing eye"
4327,IV.,Sees not in life the beauty till it sees
4328,IV.,God and the life beyond; not in a dream
4329,IV.,Of Pantheistic revery where all
4330,IV.,"In all is lost, diluted, and absorbed,"
4331,IV.,And consciousness and personality
4332,IV.,"Vanish like smoke forever; but all real,"
4333,IV.,"Distinct, and individual, though all"
4334,IV.,Eternally dependent on the One!
4335,IV.,"Who gave the Eye to see, shall He not see?"
4336,IV.,"Who gave the Heart to feel, shall He not love?"
4337,IV.,"Of knowledge infinite we know a letter,"
4338,IV.,"A syllable or two, and thirst for more:"
4339,IV.,"Is there not One, Teacher at once and Cause,"
4340,IV.,"Who comprehends all beauty and all science,"
4341,IV.,"Holding infinity, that, step by step,"
4342,IV.,"We may advance, and find, in what seems good"
4343,IV.,"To Him, our gladness and our being's crown?"
4344,IV.,"If this were not, then what a toy the world!"
4345,IV.,And what a mockery these suns and systems!
4346,IV.,And how like pumping at an empty cistern
4347,IV.,Were it to live and study and aspire!
4348,IV.,"Come, then, O Art! and warm me with thy smile!"
4349,IV.,Flash on my inward sight thy radiant shapes!
4350,IV.,"August interpreter of thoughts divine,"
4351,IV.,"Whether in sound, or word, or form revealed!"
4352,IV.,Pledge and credential of immortal life!
4353,IV.,Grand arbiter of truth! Consoler! come!
4354,IV.,"Come, help even me to seek thee and to find!"
4355,IV.,

4358,V.,
4359,V.,Winter is here again; it sees me still
4360,V.,At work upon my picture. This presents
4361,V.,"Two vases, filled with flowers, upon a slab."
4362,V.,"""Which will you choose?"" I call it: 'tis in oil."
4363,V.,"Three hours a day are all I give to it,"
4364,V.,"So fine the work, so trying to the eyes."
4365,V.,Thus have I ample time for teaching Rachel:
4366,V.,A good child and affectionate! I've found
4367,V.,"Her aptitude; she has a taste in bonnets,"
4368,V.,With an inventive skill in ornament.
4369,V.,And so I have her regularly taught
4370,V.,By an accomplished milliner; and Rachel
4371,V.,Already promises to lead her teacher.
4372,V.,"Had I a fortune, still I'd have her feel"
4373,V.,That she must conquer something worthily;
4374,V.,"Something to occupy her active powers,"
4375,V.,"And yield a fair support, should need require."
4376,V.,
4377,V.,
4378,VI.,VI.
4379,VI.,
4380,VI.,Whom should I meet to-day but Meredith!
4381,VI.,"My washerwoman, Ellen Blount, is ill,"
4382,VI.,So ill I fear she never will be well.
4383,VI.,"'Tis the old story, every day renewed:"
4384,VI.,"A little humble, tender-hearted woman,"
4385,VI.,Tied to a husband whom to call a brute
4386,VI.,Would be to vilify the quadrupeds!
4387,VI.,"A fellow, who must have his pipe, his whiskey,"
4388,VI.,"And his good dinner, let what may befall"
4389,VI.,His wife and children. He could take the pittance
4390,VI.,"She got from her hard toil, and spend it on"
4391,VI.,Himself and his companions of the jug.
4392,VI.,"When out of work, as he would often be,"
4393,VI.,Then double toil for her! with peevish words
4394,VI.,"From him, the sole requital of it all!"
4395,VI.,"Child after child she bore him; but, compelled"
4396,VI.,Too quickly after childbirth to return
4397,VI.,"To the old wash-tub, all her sufferings"
4398,VI.,"Reacted on the children, and they died,"
4399,VI.,"Haply in infancy the most of them,--"
4400,VI.,"Until but one was left,--a little boy,"
4401,VI.,"Puny and pale, gentle and uncomplaining,"
4402,VI.,With all the mother staring from his eyes
4403,VI.,"In hollow, anxious, pitiful appeal."
4404,VI.,In this one relic all her love and hope
4405,VI.,And all that made her life endurable
4406,VI.,At length were centred. She had saved a dollar
4407,VI.,To buy for him a pair of overshoes;
4408,VI.,"But, as she went to get them, Blount waylaid her,"
4409,VI.,"Learnt that she had the money, forced it from her."
4410,VI.,Poor Teddy had to go without his shoes.
4411,VI.,'Twas when the January thaw had made
4412,VI.,The streets a-reek with mud and melting snow.
4413,VI.,"Poor Teddy wet his feet, took cold, and died."
4414,VI.,"""Come soon, mamma,"" were his last feeble words."
4415,VI.,Blount was a cunning ruffian; well he knew
4416,VI.,"How far to go, and where and when to pause."
4417,VI.,"Fluent and specious with his tongue, he kept,"
4418,VI.,"In his small sphere, a certain show of credit;"
4419,VI.,"And he could blow in tune for mother church,"
4420,VI.,Though few the pennies he himself would give her.
4421,VI.,"""Cast off the wretch,"" was my advice to Ellen."
4422,VI.,She loved him not; she might as well have tried
4423,VI.,To love a load that galled and wearied her.
4424,VI.,"But custom, social fear, and, above all,"
4425,VI.,Those sacramental manacles the church
4426,VI.,"Had bound her in, and to the end would keep,"
4427,VI.,"Forbade the poor, scared, helpless little woman"
4428,VI.,"To free herself, by one condign resolve,"
4429,VI.,From the foul incubus that sucked her life.
4430,VI.,"So a false sense of duty kept her tied,"
4431,VI.,Feeding in him all that was pitiless.
4432,VI.,And now she's dying. I had gone to-day
4433,VI.,"To take some little dainties, cream and fruit,"
4434,VI.,"And there, administering consolation,"
4435,VI.,Was Meredith.
4436,VI.,
4437,VI.,"Hearing his tones of faith,"
4438,VI.,"Seeing his saintly look of sympathy,"
4439,VI.,"I felt, there being between us no dissent"
4440,VI.,"In spirit, dogmas were of small account:"
4441,VI.,And so I knelt and listened to his prayer.
4442,VI.,"At length he noticed me, and recognized."
4443,VI.,"""Miss Percival!"" he cried; ""can this be you?"
4444,VI.,"But when and why did you return from England?"""
4445,VI.,"""I've never been in England, never been"
4446,VI.,"Out of my native country,"" I replied."
4447,VI.,"""But that is unaccountable,"" said he;"
4448,VI.,"""For I've seen letters, written as from you,"
4449,VI.,"Signed with your name, acknowledging receipts"
4450,VI.,"Of certain sums of money, dated London."""
4451,VI.,"""No money have I had but what I've earned,"""
4452,VI.,"Was my reply; ""and who should send me money?"""
4453,VI.,"Said he: ""I have a carriage at the door;"
4454,VI.,I would learn more of this; you'll not object
4455,VI.,"To take a seat with me? Thank you; that's right."""
4456,VI.,
4457,VI.,"Leaving the patient in good hands, we went,"
4458,VI.,And through the noisy streets drove to the Park.
4459,VI.,Then all I'd ever known about my parents
4460,VI.,He drew from me; and all my history
4461,VI.,Since I had parted from him; noted down
4462,VI.,"Carefully my address, and gave me his."
4463,VI.,"Then to my lodgings driving with me back,"
4464,VI.,He left me with a _Benedicite_!
4465,VI.,"He's rich: has he been sending money, then?"
4466,VI.,What means it all? Conjecture finds no clew.
4467,VI.,
4468,VI.,
4469,VII.,VII.
4470,VII.,
4471,VII.,Gently as thistle-downs are borne away
4472,VII.,"From the dry stem, went Ellen yesterday."
4473,VII.,I heard her dying utterance; it was:
4474,VII.,"""I'm coming, Teddy! Bless you, dear Miss Linda!"""
4475,VII.,"No priest was by, so sudden was her going."
4476,VII.,"When Blount came in, there was no tenderness"
4477,VII.,"In his sleek, gluttonous look; although he tried,"
4478,VII.,"Behind his handkerchief, to play the mourner."
4479,VII.,What will he do without a drudge to tread on?
4480,VII.,"Counting himself a privileged lord and master,"
4481,VII.,"He'll condescend to a new victim soon,"
4482,VII.,And make some patient waiter a sad loser.
4483,VII.,
4484,VII.,
4485,VIII.,VIII.
4486,VIII.,
4487,VIII.,"""Some patient waiter!"" Such a one I know."
4488,VIII.,"There was a time when I resolved, if ever"
4489,VIII.,"I could secure a modest competence,"
4490,VIII.,I would be married; and the competence
4491,VIII.,Is now secure--but where is my resolve?
4492,VIII.,Shall I conclude 'tis all fatality?
4493,VIII.,"Leave it to chance, and take no active step"
4494,VIII.,Myself to seek what I so hope to find?
4495,VIII.,"Accepting it as heaven's fixed ordinance,"
4496,VIII.,"That man should change his single lot at will,"
4497,VIII.,"But woman be the sport of circumstance,"
4498,VIII.,"A purposeless and passive accident,"
4499,VIII.,"Inert as oysters waiting for a tide,"
4500,VIII.,"But not like oysters, sure of what they wait for?"
4501,VIII.,"""Ah! woman's strength is in passivity,"""
4502,VIII.,"Fastidio says, shaking his wise, wise head,"
4503,VIII.,And withering me with a disdainful stare.
4504,VIII.,"Nay! woman's strength is in developing,"
4505,VIII.,"In virtuous ways, all that is best in her."
4506,VIII.,No superstitious waiting then be mine!
4507,VIII.,"No fancy that in coy, alluring arts,"
4508,VIII.,"Rather than action, modest and sincere,"
4509,VIII.,Woman most worthily performs her part.
4510,VIII.,"Here am I twenty-five, and all alone"
4511,VIII.,"In the wide world; yet having won the right,"
4512,VIII.,"By my own effort, to hew out my lot,"
4513,VIII.,And create ties to cheer this arid waste.
4514,VIII.,"How bleak and void my Future, if I stand"
4515,VIII.,"Waiting beside the stream, until some Prince--"
4516,VIII.,Son of Queen Moonbeam by King Will-o'-the wisp--
4517,VIII.,"Appears, and jumping from his gilded boat,"
4518,VIII.,Lays heart and fortune at my idle feet!
4519,VIII.,"Ye languid day-dreams, vanish! let me act!"
4520,VIII.,
4521,VIII.,"But ah! Fastidio says, ""A woman's wooing"
4522,VIII.,Must always be offensive to a man
4523,VIII.,"Of any dignity."" The dignity"
4524,VIII.,That modest truth can shock is far too frail
4525,VIII.,"And sensitive to mate with love of mine,"
4526,VIII.,Whose earnestness might crush the feeble hand
4527,VIII.,"Linked in its own. So good by, dignity!"
4528,VIII.,I shall survive the chill of your repulse.
4529,VIII.,"Defiance, not of Nature's law, but Custom's,"
4530,VIII.,Is what disturbs Fastidio. Does he think
4531,VIII.,That a _man's_ wooing never is offensive
4532,VIII.,To _woman's_ dignity? In either sex
4533,VIII.,The disaffection is not prompted by
4534,VIII.,The wooing but the wooer; love can never
4535,VIII.,Be an unwelcome tribute to the lover;
4536,VIII.,"Though freedom premature, or forwardness"
4537,VIII.,"Unwarranted, may rightly fail to win."
4538,VIII.,And so I'll run my risk; for I confess--
4539,VIII.,"(Keep the unuttered secret, sacred leaf!)--"
4540,VIII.,"That there is one whom I could love--could die for,"
4541,VIII.,"Would he but--Tears? Well, tears may come from strength"
4542,VIII.,As well as weakness: I'll not grudge him these;
4543,VIII.,I'll not despair while I can shed a tear.
4544,VIII.,
4545,VIII.,
4546,IX.,IX.
4547,IX.,
4548,IX.,I've found him--seen him! The Directory
4549,IX.,"Gave me his residence. He keeps a school,"
4550,IX.,One for young ladies only; and at once
4551,IX.,My coward heart hit on a good excuse
4552,IX.,For calling on him: Would he take a pupil?
4553,IX.,"Rachel, my protégée? Of course he would."
4554,IX.,"A flush of tender, joyful wonderment,"
4555,IX.,"Methought, illumed his face at seeing me;"
4556,IX.,"Then, as it faded, I was grieved to mark"
4557,IX.,How pale and thin and worn with care he looked.
4558,IX.,"I took my leave, promising to return"
4559,IX.,Within a week; and on the outer steps
4560,IX.,"I met his father. ""Turn and walk with me"
4561,IX.,"A square or two,"" said I; and he complied."
4562,IX.,"""What ails him?"" I inquired. ""Only hard work:"
4563,IX.,He puts too much of conscience into it.
4564,IX.,"Needs help, but shrinks from debt, and so keeps on"
4565,IX.,Doing the labor two or three should share.
4566,IX.,"What shall I do, Miss Percival, to stop it?"""
4567,IX.,"""I know not,--only something must be done,"
4568,IX.,"And that at once,"" said I, in tones which made"
4569,IX.,The old man turn to get a look at me.
4570,IX.,"I hailed an omnibus, and there we parted...."
4571,IX.,What if I write Charles Lothian a letter?
4572,IX.,"Nay, I'll not skulk behind a sheet of paper,"
4573,IX.,But face to face say what I have to say.
4574,IX.,This very evening must I call again.
4575,IX.,Let a firm will bear up my fainting heart!
4576,IX.,
4577,IX.,
4578,X.,X.
4579,X.,
4580,X.,"And so at eight o'clock the carriage came,"
4581,X.,And entering it I drove to Lothian's.
4582,X.,At last I was alone with him once more!
4583,X.,He had been sitting at a table heaped
4584,X.,"With manuscripts, and these he was correcting."
4585,X.,"""I'm here to interrupt all this,"" said I;"
4586,X.,"""Too long you've kept your brain upon the stretch:"
4587,X.,"Why be so heedless of your health, your life?"""
4588,X.,"""But what are they to you, Miss Percival?"""
4589,X.,"""And that is what I've come to let you know,"""
4590,X.,"Said I, emboldened by the offered foothold."
4591,X.,"He flushed a little, only just a little,--"
4592,X.,"Replying, ""_That_ I'm curious to learn."""
4593,X.,"And then, like one who, in the dark, at first"
4594,X.,"Moves cautiously, but soon runs boldly on,"
4595,X.,"I said: ""Rash gambler that I am, I've come"
4596,X.,To put upon the hazard of a die
4597,X.,Much of my present and my future peace;
4598,X.,"Perhaps to shock, repel, and anger you,"
4599,X.,Since 'twill not be unwarned that I offend.
4600,X.,"I know you guess my purpose, and you shrink"
4601,X.,"From hearing me avow it; but I will,"
4602,X.,And that in homely English unadorned.
4603,X.,I'm here to offer you my hand; the heart
4604,X.,"That should go with it has preceded it,"
4605,X.,"And dwells with you, so you can claim your own,"
4606,X.,"Or gently bid it go, to trouble you"
4607,X.,Never again. If 'tis unwomanly
4608,X.,"This to avow, then I'm unlike my sex,"
4609,X.,"Not false to my own nature,--ah! not false."
4610,X.,I must be true or die; I cannot play
4611,X.,"A masker's part, disguising hopes that cling"
4612,X.,"Nearest my brooding heart. But, say the word,"
4613,X.,"'I cannot love you,' and the bird who leaves"
4614,X.,The cage where he has pined will sooner try
4615,X.,"To enter it again, than I return"
4616,X.,"To utter plaint of mine within your hearing."""
4617,X.,
4618,X.,With throbbing heart and burning face I ceased.
4619,X.,"Twice, thrice he tried to stop me; but my words"
4620,X.,Came all too quick and earnestly for that.
4621,X.,"And then resigned he listened. I had seen,"
4622,X.,"Or dreamed I had, at first a sacred joy"
4623,X.,"At my avowal sparkle in his eyes,"
4624,X.,"And then an utter sadness follow it,"
4625,X.,"Which chilled me, and I knew that I had failed."
4626,X.,
4627,X.,"""O divine Pity! what will you not brave?"""
4628,X.,"He answered, and the dew was in his eyes,--"
4629,X.,"""You bring her here, even to abase herself"
4630,X.,To rescue me! Too costly sacrifice!
4631,X.,"Here do not dwell the Graces and the Loves,"
4632,X.,But Drudgery is master of the house.
4633,X.,"Dear lady, elsewhere seek the answering bloom."""
4634,X.,"A hope flashed up. ""Do you suppose,"" said I,"
4635,X.,"""That any impulse less supreme than love--"
4636,X.,"Love bold to venture, but intemerate--"
4637,X.,"Could bring me here--that Pity could do this?"""
4638,X.,
4639,X.,"""I believe all,"" he answered, ""all you say;"
4640,X.,But do not bid me whisper more than this:
4641,X.,"The circumstances that environ me,"
4642,X.,"And which none know,--not even my father knows,--"
4643,X.,Shut me out utterly from any hope
4644,X.,Of marriage or of love. A wretch in prison
4645,X.,Might better dream of marrying than I.
4646,X.,"But O sweet lady! rashly generous,--"
4647,X.,"Around whom, a protecting atmosphere,"
4648,X.,"Floats Purity, and sends her messengers"
4649,X.,With flaming swords to guard each avenue
4650,X.,"From thoughts unholy and approaches base,--"
4651,X.,Thou who hast made an act I deemed uncomely
4652,X.,"Seem beautiful and gracious,--do not doubt"
4653,X.,"My memory of thy worth shall be the same,"
4654,X.,"Only expanded, lifted up, and touched"
4655,X.,With light as dear as sunset radiance
4656,X.,"To summer trees after a thunder-storm."""
4657,X.,
4658,X.,And there was silence then between us two.
4659,X.,Thought of myself was lost in thought for him.
4660,X.,"What was my wreck of joy, compared with his?"
4661,X.,"Health, youth, and competence were mine, and he"
4662,X.,Was staking all of his to save another.
4663,X.,"If my winged hopes fell fluttering to the ground,"
4664,X.,Regrets and disappointments were forgotten
4665,X.,"In the reflection, He, then, is unhappy!"
4666,X.,"""Good by!"" at length I said, giving my hand:"
4667,X.,"""Even as I was believed, will I believe."
4668,X.,You do not deal in hollow compliment;
4669,X.,And we shall meet again if you're content.
4670,X.,"The good time will return--and I'll return!"""
4671,X.,"""If you return, the good time will return"
4672,X.,"And stay as long as you remain,"" said he."

4674,X.,
4675,XI.,XI.
4676,XI.,
4677,XI.,It is as I supposed: an obstacle
4678,XI.,Which his assumption of his father's debts
4679,XI.,Has raised before him unexpectedly!
4680,XI.,I did not let a day go by before
4681,XI.,"I saw the elder Lothian, and he,"
4682,XI.,"Distressed by what I told him of a secret,"
4683,XI.,Applied himself to hunting up a key
4684,XI.,"To the mysterious grief: at last he got it,"
4685,XI.,Though not by means that I could justify.
4686,XI.,In Charles's private escritoire he found
4687,XI.,A memorandum that explained it all.
4688,XI.,"Among the obligations overlooked,"
4689,XI.,"In settling up the firm's accounts, was one"
4690,XI.,"Of fifty thousand dollars, payable"
4691,XI.,"To an estate, the representatives"
4692,XI.,"Of which were six small children and a widow,"
4693,XI.,Dependent now on what they could derive
4694,XI.,Of income from this debt; and manfully
4695,XI.,"Charles shoulders it, although it crushes him;"
4696,XI.,And hopes to keep his father ignorant.
4697,XI.,I can command one quarter of the sum
4698,XI.,Already--but the rest? That staggers me.
4699,XI.,And yet why should I falter? Look at _him_!
4700,XI.,Let his example be my high incentive.
4701,XI.,"I'll be his helpmate, and he shall not know it."
4702,XI.,"Poor Charles! I'll toil for him,--to him devote"
4703,XI.,"All that I have of energy and skill,"
4704,XI.,All I acquire. Ambition shall not mount
4705,XI.,Less loftily for having Love to help it.
4706,XI.,"Come forth, my easel! All thy work has been"
4707,XI.,Girl's play till now; now will I truly venture.
4708,XI.,I've a new object now--to rescue _him_!
4709,XI.,And he shall never know his rescuer
4710,XI.,"From lips of mine,--no, though I die for it,"
4711,XI.,"With the sweet secret undisclosed,--my heart"

4727,I.,Few but a priest can know the fearful depth
4728,I.,Of human wickedness. At times I shrink
4729,I.,Faint and amazed at what I have to learn:
4730,I.,And then I wonder that the Saviour said
4731,I.,His yoke is easy and his burden light.
4732,I.,Ah! how these very murmurs at my lot
4733,I.,Show that not yet into my heart has crept
4734,I.,That peace of God which passeth understanding!
4735,I.,
4736,I.,
4737,II.,II.
4738,II.,
4739,II.,Among my hearers lately there has been
4740,II.,A lady all attention to my words:
4741,II.,Thrice have I seen that she was deeply moved;
4742,II.,And to confession yesterday she came.
4743,II.,Let me here call her Harriet. She is
4744,II.,"By education Protestant, but wavers,"
4745,II.,"Feeling the ground beneath her insecure,"
4746,II.,And would be led unto the rock that is
4747,II.,Higher than she. A valuable convert;
4748,II.,Not young; in feeble health; taxed for two millions;
4749,II.,"And she would found, out of her ample means,"
4750,II.,A home for orphans and neglected children.
4751,II.,Heaven give me power to lead the stray one safe
4752,II.,Into the only fold; securing thus
4753,II.,"Aid for the church, salvation for herself!"
4754,II.,
4755,II.,
4756,III.,III.
4757,III.,
4758,III.,A summons took me to her house to-day.
4759,III.,Her mother and her step-father compose
4760,III.,With Harriet the household. I refrain
4761,III.,From putting real names on paper here.
4762,III.,"Let me then call the man's name, Denison;"
4763,III.,"He's somewhat younger than his wife, a lady"
4764,III.,"Advanced in years, but her heart wholly set"
4765,III.,On the frivolities of fashion still.
4766,III.,I see the situation at a glance:
4767,III.,A mercenary marriage on the part
4768,III.,"Of Denison, whose hungry eyes are fixed"
4769,III.,Upon the daughter's property; the mother
4770,III.,"Under his evil influence, and expecting"
4771,III.,"The daughter to die soon, without a will,"
4772,III.,Thus leaving all to them;--and Harriet
4773,III.,Not quite so dull but she can penetrate
4774,III.,Denison's motive and her mother's hope!
4775,III.,A sad state for an invalid who feels
4776,III.,That any hour may be her last! To-day
4777,III.,Harriet confessed; for she has been alarmed
4778,III.,"By some bad symptoms lately. As she urged it,"
4779,III.,"I sent word to the bishop, and he came,"
4780,III.,"And she was formally confirmed, and taken"
4781,III.,"Unto the bosom of the Church, and there"
4782,III.,May her poor toiling spirit find repose!
4783,III.,
4784,III.,
4785,IV.,IV.
4786,IV.,
4787,IV.,"Another summons! In the drawing-room,"
4788,IV.,Whom should I meet but Denison? His stare
4789,IV.,"Had something vicious in it; but we bowed,"
4790,IV.,"And he remarked: ""I hear that Harriet,"
4791,IV.,"Caught in your Catholic net, is turning saint."
4792,IV.,"No foul play, priest! She's not in a condition"
4793,IV.,"To make a will, or give away her money."
4794,IV.,"Remember that, and do not waste your words."""
4795,IV.,"My color rose, and the brute Adam in me"
4796,IV.,"Would, uncontrolled, have surely knocked him down."
4797,IV.,"But I cast off temptation, and replied:"
4798,IV.,"""Sir, I'm responsible to God, not man."""
4799,IV.,"I left him, and passed on to Harriet."
4800,IV.,I found her greatly moved; an interview
4801,IV.,She had been having with her mother caused
4802,IV.,"The agitation. ""Take me hence!"" she cried;"
4803,IV.,"""I'll not remain another day or hour"
4804,IV.,"Under this roof. I tell you, I'm not safe"
4805,IV.,"With these two, watching, dogging, maddening me."""
4806,IV.,"She rang the bell, and to the servant said:"
4807,IV.,"""My carriage, and that quickly!"" Then to me:"
4808,IV.,"""I'll show them that I'm mistress of my fortune"
4809,IV.,And of myself. Call on me in an hour
4810,IV.,"At the Fifth Avenue Hotel, for there"
4811,IV.,"Henceforth I make my home."" And there"
4812,IV.,"I called, as she had ordered, and we met"
4813,IV.,"In her own parlor. ""What I wish,"" said she,"
4814,IV.,"""Is to give all I have, without reserve,"
4815,IV.,For the foundation that I've planned. I'll send
4816,IV.,"Directions to my lawyer, and the papers"
4817,IV.,"Shall be prepared at once.""--""Before you do it,"
4818,IV.,"Let me learn more of you and yours,"" said I:"
4819,IV.,"""Who was your father?"" Then, to my surprise,"
4820,IV.,I learnt that he was one whom I had met
4821,IV.,"Some years before,--in his death-hour had met."
4822,IV.,"""But you've a sister?"" suddenly I asked."
4823,IV.,"Surprised, she answered: ""A half-sister--yes--"
4824,IV.,I've seen her only once; for many years
4825,IV.,"I lived in Europe; she's in England now,"
4826,IV.,And married happily. On three occasions
4827,IV.,"I've sent her money.""--""Do you correspond?"""
4828,IV.,"""Not often; here are letters from her, full"
4829,IV.,"Of thanks for all I've given her.""--""In your will"
4830,IV.,"Shall you remember her?""--""If you advise it."""
4831,IV.,"""Then I advise a liberal bequest."
4832,IV.,And now I must attend a sufferer
4833,IV.,"Who waits my help.""--""Father, I would confess."""
4834,IV.,"""Daughter, be quick: I listen."" Harriet"
4835,IV.,Then gave a sad recital of a trial
4836,IV.,And a divorce; and (but reluctantly)
4837,IV.,"Told of a terrible suspicion, born"
4838,IV.,"Of a remark, dropped by a servant once,"
4839,IV.,Concerning her unlikeness to her father:
4840,IV.,But never could she wring a confirmation
4841,IV.,Of the distressing story from her mother.
4842,IV.,"""Tell her,"" said I, ""you mean to leave your sister"
4843,IV.,"A handsome legacy."" She promised this."
4844,IV.,"Then saying I would call the following day,"
4845,IV.,I hurried off to see poor Ellen Blount.
4846,IV.,
4847,IV.,
4848,V.,V.
4849,V.,
4850,V.,"A new surprise! There, by the patient's bed,"
4851,V.,"I came on Linda, Harriet's half-sister!"
4852,V.,"(Reputed so, at least, but here's a doubt.)"
4853,V.,"I questioned her, and now am satisfied"
4854,V.,"Treason and forgery have been at work,"
4855,V.,Defeating Harriet's sisterly intent;
4856,V.,"Moreover, that the harrowing surmise,"
4857,V.,"Waked by a servant's gossip overheard,"
4858,V.,"Is, in all probability, the truth!"
4859,V.,"And, if we so accept it, what can I"
4860,V.,Advise but Harriet's complete surrender
4861,V.,Of all her fortune to the real child
4862,V.,And proper heir of Albert Percival?
4863,V.,But ah! 'tis now devoted to the Church!
4864,V.,Here's a divided duty; I must lay
4865,V.,The case before a higher power than mine.
4866,V.,
4867,V.,
4868,VI.,VI.
4869,VI.,
4870,VI.,I've had a long discussion with the bishop.
4871,VI.,"I placed before him all the facts, beginning"
4872,VI.,With those of my own presence at the death
4873,VI.,Of Linda's parents; of her father's letter
4874,VI.,"Received that day, communicating news"
4875,VI.,Of Kenrick's large bequest; the father's effort
4876,VI.,In dying to convey in legal form
4877,VI.,To his child Linda all this property;
4878,VI.,"The failure of the effort; his decease,"
4879,VI.,And all I knew of subsequent events.
4880,VI.,"And the good bishop, after careful thought,"
4881,VI.,"Replied: ""Some way the mother must be brought"
4882,VI.,"To full confession. Of her guilt no doubt!"""
4883,VI.,I told him I had charged it on the daughter
4884,VI.,To tell her mother of the legacy
4885,VI.,"Designed for Linda; this, perchance, might wring"
4886,VI.,Confession from the guilty one. He seemed
4887,VI.,"To think it not unlikely, and remarked:"
4888,VI.,"""When that is got, there's but a single course"
4889,VI.,"For you to urge on Harriet; for, my son,"
4890,VI.,"I need not tell a Christian gentleman,"
4891,VI.,"Not to say priest, that this peculiar case"
4892,VI.,We must decide precisely as we would
4893,VI.,If the Church had in it no interest:
4894,VI.,"Let Harriet at once give up, convey,"
4895,VI.,"Not bequeathe merely, all she has to Linda."
4896,VI.,"Till she does this, her soul will be in peril;"
4897,VI.,"When she does this, she shall be made the ward"
4898,VI.,"Of Holy Church, and cared for to the end."""
4899,VI.,I kissed his hand and left. How his high thoughts
4900,VI.,Poured round my path a flood of light divine!
4901,VI.,"Why did I hesitate, since he could make"
4902,VI.,The path of duty so directly clear!
4903,VI.,
4904,VI.,
4905,VII.,VII.
4906,VII.,
4907,VII.,Harriet's intimation to her mother
4908,VII.,That she should leave a good part of her wealth
4909,VII.,To her half-sister brought things to a crisis.
4910,VII.,To-day my visit found the two together:
4911,VII.,"Harriet, in an agony of tears,"
4912,VII.,"Cried to me, as I entered,--""'Tis all true!"
4913,VII.,God! She confesses it--confesses it!
4914,VII.,"Confesses, too, she never sent the money,"
4915,VII.,And that the letters were all forgeries!
4916,VII.,"And thinks, by this confession, to secure"
4917,VII.,My fortune to herself! Ah! Can this woman
4918,VII.,"Be, then, my mother?"""
4919,VII.,
4920,VII.,"Hereupon the woman,"
4921,VII.,"Crimson with rage at being thus exposed,"
4922,VII.,"Exclaimed, ""Unnatural daughter--"" But before"
4923,VII.,"Her wrath could vent itself, she, with a groan,"
4924,VII.,Fell in convulsions. Medical assistance
4925,VII.,"Was had at once. Then Denison came in,"
4926,VII.,Aghast at what had happened; for he knew
4927,VII.,"His wife's estate was all in lands and houses,"
4928,VII.,"And would, if she should die, be Harriet's,"
4929,VII.,Since the old lady superstitiously
4930,VII.,Had still put off the making of a will.
4931,VII.,"All help was vain, and drugs were powerless."
4932,VII.,"Paralysis had struck the heated brain,"
4933,VII.,Driving from mortal hold the consciousness:
4934,VII.,"It reappeared not in one outward sign,"
4935,VII.,And before midnight life had left the clay.
4936,VII.,
4937,VII.,
4938,VIII.,VIII.
4939,VIII.,
4940,VIII.,Meek and submissive as a little child
4941,VIII.,Is Harriet now; she has no will but that
4942,VIII.,The Church imposes as the will divine.
4943,VIII.,"""Your fortune, nearly doubled by this death,"
4944,VIII.,"Must all,"" said I, ""be now conveyed to Linda."""
4945,VIII.,"""Let it be done,"" she cried, ""before I sleep!"""
4946,VIII.,"And it was done to-night--securely done,--"
4947,VIII.,I being Linda's representative.
4948,VIII.,To-morrow I must take her the good news.
4949,VIII.,
4950,VIII.,
4951,IX.,IX.
4952,IX.,
4953,IX.,"After the storm, the rainbow, child of light!"
4954,IX.,"Such the transition, as I pass to Linda!"
4955,IX.,I found her hard at work upon a picture.
4956,IX.,With wonder at Heaven's ways she heard my news.
4957,IX.,"Shocked at the tragic death, she did not hide"
4958,IX.,Her satisfaction at the tardy act
4959,IX.,Bringing the restitution of her own.
4960,IX.,Three things she asked; one was that I would place
4961,IX.,At once a certain person in possession
4962,IX.,"Of a large sum, not letting him find out"
4963,IX.,From whom it came; another was to have
4964,IX.,This great change in her fortunes kept a secret
4965,IX.,As long as she might wish; the third and last
4966,IX.,Was that she might be privileged to wait
4967,IX.,On Harriet with a sister's loving care.
4968,IX.,"All which I promised readily should be,"
4969,IX.,So far as my poor human will could order.
4970,IX.,"Said Linda then: ""Tell Harriet, her scheme"
4971,IX.,For others' welfare shall not wholly fail;
4972,IX.,That in your hands I'll place a sum sufficient
4973,IX.,"To plant the _germ_ at least of what she planned."""
4974,IX.,
4975,IX.,
4976,X.,X.
4977,X.,
4978,X.,I've taken my last look of Harriet:
4979,X.,"She died in Linda's arms, and comforted"
4980,X.,With all the Church could give of heavenly hope.
4981,X.,Slowly and imperceptibly does Time
4982,X.,Work out the dreadful problem of our sins!
4983,X.,Not often do we see it solved as here
4984,X.,In plain results which he who runs may read.
4985,X.,Not always is the sinner's punishment
4986,X.,Shown in this world. May the Eternal Mercy
4987,X.,"Cleanse us from secret faults, nor, while we mark"
4988,X.,"Another's foulness, blind us to our own!"

4995,BESIDE THE LAKE.,BESIDE THE LAKE.
4996,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
4997,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
4998,BESIDE THE LAKE.,The sun of August from a clear blue sky
4999,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Shone on Lake Saranac. The South-wind stirred
5000,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Mildly the woods encircling, that threw down"
5001,BESIDE THE LAKE.,A purple shadow on the liquid smoothness
5002,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Glassing the eastern border, while the west"
5003,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Lay bared to light.
5004,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
5005,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Wild, virgin nature all!"
5006,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Except that here and there a partial clearing,"
5007,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Made by the sportsman's axe for summer tents,"
5008,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Dented the massive verdure, and revealed"
5009,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"A little slope of bank, dotted with stumps"
5010,BESIDE THE LAKE.,And brown with slender aromatic leaves
5011,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Shed from the pine, the hemlock, and the fir"
5012,BESIDE THE LAKE.,In layers that gave a soft and slippery carpet.
5013,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
5014,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Near one of these small openings where the breeze
5015,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Crept resinous and cool from evergreens
5016,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Behind them, while the sun blazed bright before,--"
5017,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Where with the pine-trees' vapory depth of hue
5018,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"The whiteness of a spacious tent contrasted,"
5019,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Beside which, on a staff, the nation's flag"
5020,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Flung out its crimson with protecting pride,--"
5021,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Reclined a wife and husband, looking down"
5022,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Less on the glorious lake than on the glory
5023,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"That, through a gauzy veil, played round the head"
5024,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Of a reposing infant, golden-tressed,"
5025,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Asleep upon a deer-skin at their feet,"
5026,BESIDE THE LAKE.,While a huge dog kept watchful guard beyond:
5027,BESIDE THE LAKE.,For there lay little Mary Merivale.
5028,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
5029,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Boats on the lake showed that this group detached
5030,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Were part of a well-chosen company.
5031,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Here children ran and frolicked on the beach;
5032,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"There an old man, rowed by two guides, stood up"
5033,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"With rod and line and reel, while swiftly flew"
5034,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"The reel, announcing that a vigorous trout"
5035,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Just then had seized the hook. Came the loud cry,--"
5036,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"""Look, Charles! Look, Linda! See me land him now!"
5037,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Don't touch him with your scoop, men! I can fetch him,""--"
5038,BESIDE THE LAKE.,In tones not unfamiliar to our ears.
5039,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"And there, six boats swept by, from which the voices"
5040,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Of merry children and their elder friends--
5041,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Mothers and fathers, teachers, faded aunts,"
5042,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Dyspeptic uncles, wonderfully cured"
5043,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"All by this tonic, Adirondack air--"
5044,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Came musical and loud: a strange collection,"
5045,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Winnowed by Rachel (now the important queen
5046,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Of all this sanitary revelry)
5047,BESIDE THE LAKE.,From her acquaintance in the public schools;
5048,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Whence her quick sympathies had carried her
5049,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Straight to the overworked, the poor, the ailing,"
5050,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Among the families of her associates,"
5051,BESIDE THE LAKE.,When Linda planned this happy enterprise
5052,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Of a grand camping-out for one whole month.
5053,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"The blind aunt and the grandmother, of course,"
5054,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"High and important persons, Rachel's aids,"
5055,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Graced the occasion; for the ancient dame
5056,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Had lived in such a region in her youth,"
5057,BESIDE THE LAKE.,And in all sylvan craft was proudly wise:
5058,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Declaring that this taste of life would add
5059,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Some ten years to her eighty-five, at least."
5060,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
5061,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"On went the boats, all large and safely manned,"
5062,BESIDE THE LAKE.,In competition not too venturesome.
5063,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Then, from a rocky outlook on the hill,"
5064,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"There came a gush of music from a band,"
5065,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Employed to cheer with timely melody
5066,BESIDE THE LAKE.,This strange encampment in the wilderness.
5067,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Hark! Every voice is hushed as down the lake
5068,BESIDE THE LAKE.,The breathing clarions accordant send
5069,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"The tune of ""Love Not"" to each eager ear!"
5070,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"The very infant, in its slumber, smiled"
5071,BESIDE THE LAKE.,As if a dream of some old paradise
5072,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Had been awakened by the ravishment.
5073,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
5074,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"""Look at the child!"" cried Linda; ""mark that smile!"
5075,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"All heaven reflected in a dew-drop! See!"""
5076,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"""And all the world grasped in that little fist,--"
5077,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"At least as we esteem the world!"" cried Charles."
5078,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"""And yet,"" said Linda, ""'tis a glorious world:"
5079,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"See how those families enjoy themselves!"""
5080,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"""And who created all this happiness?"""
5081,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"The husband said,--""who, after God, but Linda?"
5082,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Who spends her money, not in rearing piles"
5083,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Of cold and costly marble for her pride,--"
5084,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Not in great banquets for the rich and gay
5085,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Who need them not, and laugh at those who give,--"
5086,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Where, at one feast, enough is spent to make"
5087,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"All these poor people radiant for a month,--"
5088,BESIDE THE LAKE.,But in exhilarations coming from
5089,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Communicated joy and health and life,--"
5090,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"The happiness that's found in making happy."""
5091,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
5092,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"""All selfishness!"" cried Linda; ""selfishness!"
5093,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"I seek my happiness, and others theirs;"
5094,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Only my tastes are different; more plebeian,"
5095,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Haply, they'd say; but, husband mine, reflect!"
5096,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"You, too, I fear, are lacking in refinement:"
5097,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Would this have been, had you not acquiesced"
5098,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"In all these vulgar freaks, and found content,"
5099,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Like me, in giving pleasure to the needy?"
5100,BESIDE THE LAKE.,And tell me--passing to another point--
5101,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Where would have been the monarch of this joy,"
5102,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"That little child,--that antepast of bliss"
5103,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Such as the angels taste,--had I recoiled"
5104,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"From daring as I did, even when I knew"
5105,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"He I most wished to win would think me bold?"""
5106,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
5107,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"""Ah! little wife,"" cried Charles, ""I've half a mind"
5108,BESIDE THE LAKE.,To tell you what I've never told you yet.
5109,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Yes, I _will_ tell you all, although it may"
5110,BESIDE THE LAKE.,End the complacent thought that Linda did it--
5111,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Did it by simply daring to propose!
5112,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Know, then, a constant track of you I kept,"
5113,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Even while I seemed to shun you.  I could kneel
5114,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Before your recollection in my heart,"
5115,BESIDE THE LAKE.,When you regarded me as shy and cold.
5116,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"And, while by poverty held reticent,"
5117,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"I saw, supreme among my hopes, but Linda!"
5118,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Before we left the sea-side I had learnt,"
5119,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Through gossip of my worthy landlady,"
5120,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Where you would go, returning to New York."
5121,BESIDE THE LAKE.,I found your house; I passed it more than once
5122,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"When, like a beacon, shone your study-lamp."
5123,BESIDE THE LAKE.,The very night before you called upon me
5124,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"To ask, would I take Rachel as my pupil,"
5125,BESIDE THE LAKE.,(How kind in you to patronize my school!)
5126,BESIDE THE LAKE.,I sought an anodyne for my despair
5127,BESIDE THE LAKE.,In watching for your shadow on the curtain.
5128,BESIDE THE LAKE.,
5129,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"""Discovery of that unexpected debt,"
5130,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"Owed by my father, killed the last faint hope"
5131,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Which I had cherished; and our interview--
5132,BESIDE THE LAKE.,Your daring offer of this little hand--
5133,BESIDE THE LAKE.,But made me emulous to equal you
5134,BESIDE THE LAKE.,In self-renouncing generosity;
5135,BESIDE THE LAKE.,"And so, I frankly told you what I told:"

5483,PAGE 198.,woman's condition which is more clearly natural than her passivity in
5484,PAGE 198.,"all that relates to marriage. In waiting to be wooed, she not only"
5485,PAGE 198.,"complies with one of the conventional proprieties, but obeys what"
5486,PAGE 198.,"appears to be a law of sex, _not amongst human beings only, but among"
5487,PAGE 198.,"all animals_."""
5488,PAGE 198.,
5489,PAGE 198.,"These remarks have been adopted by many American journalists, and have"
5490,PAGE 198.,been accepted perhaps by many readers as settling the whole question
5491,PAGE 198.,"with scientific accuracy and force, so far as analogies drawn from the"
5492,PAGE 198.,"habits of the lower animals can settle it. But if the critic, while"
5493,PAGE 198.,"buttering his daily bread or putting cream into his daily coffee, had"
5494,PAGE 198.,acquainted himself with the habits of the useful animal to which he is
5495,PAGE 198.,"indebted, he would never have been guilty of so prodigious a blunder. So"
5496,PAGE 198.,"far from passively ""waiting to be wooed,"" the cow, when the sexual"
5497,PAGE 198.,"impulse is awakened, will disturb the whole neighborhood by her"
5498,PAGE 198.,bellowings. Should the critic reply that this is because she is kept in
5499,PAGE 198.,"an unnatural state of restraint, such reply would add only additional"
5500,PAGE 198.,force to the contradiction of the argument which he would offer.
5501,PAGE 198.,
5502,PAGE 198.,"Other examples in abundance, in confutation of his assumption, could no"
5503,PAGE 198.,"doubt be furnished. But even were that assumption true, we might"
5504,PAGE 198.,sometimes be led to rather awkward results if we were to take the habits
5505,PAGE 198.,of the lower animals as authoritative. Certain animals have not
5506,PAGE 198.,infrequently an eccentric habit of destroying their offspring. Some of
5507,PAGE 198.,"our Chinese brethren, borrowing a hint perhaps from the brute creation,"
5508,PAGE 198.,are said to think it no sin to kill such female children as they have no
5509,PAGE 198.,use for. We hope that no enterprising critic will recommend such a
5510,PAGE 198.,solution as this of the woman problem.
