13,I,I 
14,I,"(October, 1504) "
15,I,_[Someone sings in the street below]_ 
16,I,"Fair-fleeting Youth must snatch at happiness, "
17,I,"He knows not if To-morrow curse or bless, "
18,I,Nor round what bend upon his travel-way 
19,I,The bandit Death lurks armed--of Yesterday 
20,I,His palely featured griefs he knows too well; 
21,I,"Therefore with jests To-day, come Heaven, come Hell, "
22,I,He plucks with either hand what joys he may. 
23,I,Joy is a flower 
24,I,"White-leafd or red, "
25,I,None knows which colour 
26,I,Till it is dead: 
27,I,White gives forth fragrance 
28,I,Pure as God's breath; 
29,I,Red in its dying 
30,I,Yields the gatherer death. 
31,I,_[Leonardo da Vinci speaks]_ 
32,I,"So 'tis Lorenzo's song they sing to-night, "
33,I,That haunting song which long years since he sang 
34,I,"When, with his gallants through the torch- "
35,I,"smirched dusk, "
36,I,"He laughing rode toward the Carnival, "
37,I,And young girls loosened all abroad their hair 
38,I,"And flung up petals through the cool moonlight, "
39,I,"Some of which falling rested on his face, "
40,I,Some of which falling covered up his eyes; 
41,I,And girls there were who kissed his drooping 
42,I,hands 
43,I,"And clasped his stirrups, begging him to stay, "
44,I,"To halt one little moment, stay with them: "
45,I,"_""Life is so short. Delay with us a while.""_ "
46,I,"But he rode on, and sang of joy and love. "
47,I,Lorenzo il Magnifico is dead; 
48,I,"His lips are silent, and he now could halt "
49,I,"Oh, endlessly, if one of those fair maids "
50,I,Should come to him imploring him to stay. 
51,I,For twelve slow years within the sacristy 
52,I,"Of San Lorenzo he has never waked, "
53,I,But has the rest he could not find in life-- 
54,I,"Ungrateful now, because postponed too long. "
55,I,If one should steal to him from out the past 
56,I,"And bending down should whisper low his name, "
57,I,"He would not hearken. True, she would be old, "
58,I,As are all maids of that spent gala-night; 
59,I,"So, if he heard her, he would only smile, "
60,I,For he loved only beauty in his day. 
61,II,II 
62,II,_[ Someone sings in the street below]_ 
63,II,"Fair-fleeting Youth wends ever to the West, "
64,II,"He, like the sun, too soon must sink to rest. "
65,II,"Stars of Remorse, fast-following on his track, "
66,II,"Moon of Old-Age, can nothing turn ye back f "
67,II,"Ah, soon the golden Day'll have spent his breath! "
68,II,"Then comes the drear, eventless Night of Death "
69,II,"When Youth, no longer young, all joys must lack. "
70,II,_[Leonardo da Vinci speaks]_ 
71,II,"""Then comes the drear, eventless Night of Death!"" "
72,II,"'Tis true, for who in Tuscany to-day "
73,II,Dares breathe the Medicean name aloud? 
74,II,"When a man dies, the watchers by the bed "
75,II,"Close down his eye-lids, so is he once dead; "
76,II,Twice dead is he whose mem'ry men dang down 
77,II,To dark oblivion when his soul is fled. 
78,II,"Florence forgets her singer, but his song "
79,II,"Still echoes through her streets on autumn nights, "
80,II,"And pausing at the door of some old friend, "
81,II,Bids him remember all the hope he had 
82,II,"In spacious days, before Lorenzo died . . . "
83,II,It seems Lorenzo's soul crept back to earth 
84,II,"Re-seeking Joy he coveted in life, "
85,II,Seeking the happiness he never found. 
86,II,"Yet, was his labour lost? Did he not find? "
87,II,He sang one song which lingers in men's hearts 
88,II,"And, having sung, he surely solved his quest. "
89,II,"Who of Joy's seekers finds the flower itself, "
90,II,"And plucking, knows the snow-white from the red? "
91,II,"Not I, for I've been truant in my search; "
92,II,I've pluck't the mauve of Honour and the green 
93,II,"Of cloistered Knowledge, yellow of Romance, "
94,II,"The blue which feigns a deep Tranquillity, "
95,II,"Scarlet of Boldness, purple of Despair, "
96,II,"Orange of Idleness which flaunts the sun, "
97,II,And indigo of wizard Heresy-- 
98,II,And gray which gives to Weariness unrest. 
99,II,Perchance I've clutched within this eager hand 
100,II,The Death of Joy--the fatal flower of blood. 
101,II,"I know not. This I know, I have not trod "
102,II,The quiet vale where grows the flower of white. 
103,II,Like an unwise distiller of perfume 
104,II,"I've blended each new fragrance as it came, "
105,II,Made something perfect for a day--two days; 
106,II,Then ruined all by adding something fresh. 
107,II,"First I would be a scholar, so I learned "
108,II,"Latin and Greek, and Mathematic Law. "
109,II,"Then I would be a poet, so I wrote "
110,II,"""Chi non puô quel che vuol, quel che puo voglia; "
111,II,Che quel che non si puô folle è volere. 
112,II,"Adunque saggio l'uomo è da tenere, "
113,II,"Che da quel che non puô sua vogler toglia."" "
114,II,"I could not live the wisdom which I taught, "
115,II,So I must be a master of design 
116,II,"And studied sculpture with Verocchio, "
117,II,Verocchio who had his dusty shop 
118,II,On Amo's banks in grand Lorenzo's time. 
119,II,"Thither, while yet a boy, I did resort "
120,II,And out of terra-cotta caused to smile 
121,II,"Women whose beauty ne'er hath been surpassed, "
122,II,Nor equalled in the flesh for Man's delight. 
123,II,"Still not content, I'd be an architect "
124,II,"And renovate this battered world for God, "
125,II,"Hurling across steep valleys, mile on mile "
126,II,"Through cloudland, spans of marble aqueduct; "
127,II,Leading chained rivers from the mountain-heights 
128,II,"Down to the plains where men are wont to toil, "
129,II,"There I would cause these Samsons of the crags, "
130,II,"Scenting the sea, whose waves are unconfined, "
131,II,"To shake themselves as once at other times, "
132,II,And rush in frenzy forward turning mills. 
133,II,So would each city echo to the hum 
134,II,"Of loom, and web, and swift-revolving wheels. "
135,II,"Then, when prosperity had reached its height "
136,II,"And merhants cavilled at each other's gains, "
137,II,I'd frame for them the iron beasts of war 
138,II,And hound than on to harry and destroy-- 
139,II,"And when our world was fallen, who but I, "
140,II,"Da Vinci, should stand forth to raise it up? "
141,II,These were my dreams; I thought myself divine-- 
142,II,"All this was long ago, when I was young. "
143,II,"Next I would make me wings, and I would fly "
144,II,"As do the morning birds straight t'ward the sun, "
145,II,"Piercing the mists, rise far above the clouds "
146,II,To seek out where God walks and whom He loves. 
147,II,"I made me wings, but had not strength to fly. "
148,II,"Still discontent and tethered to this world, "
149,II,"I strove to wrench the secret out of Life, "
150,II,And swept the far horizon of the stars 
151,II,"If there, at least, I might discern some sign "
152,II,"To tell me whence souls come, to where depart. "
153,II,"I, in my overhaste, pursued too far, "
154,II,Seeking that vague and fabled Paradise 
155,II,"Where Adam and his many sons sing chaunts, "
156,II,While Eve walks through them pale and deified. 
157,II,"I missed my track in pathless swamps of Time, "
158,II,"I chilled my hands against the cold-dead stars, "
159,II,"And lost my mind in unremembered Past, "
160,II,Remote from God and out of human sight. 
161,II,"Lastly I took to painting down my thoughts, "
162,II,And pictured for the King of Portugal 
163,II,"That fatal meadow in the Eden Land, "
164,II,Where Man's first sweet and deadly sin was 
165,II,wrought. 
166,II,"I, in this art, all others did excel; "
167,II,Yet with success I was not satisfied 
168,II,But hourly craved for the impossible-- 
169,II,To fashion men as real as flesh and blood. 
170,II,To-day I'd toil with fire in my brain 
171,II,"And paint away the faults of yesterday, "
172,II,"And shadow forth the dreams of yesternight, "
173,II,And so on through long months and weary years 
174,II,"Till, losing heart, I'd toss my brush aside "
175,II,Leaving the thing unfinished as it was-- 
176,II,Adding this broken promise to my last. 
177,II,"There's Raphael with his wide unanxious eyes, "
178,II,He does his work as though it were his play; 
179,II,"He never talks of fame, but sings the while "
180,II,He paints the Virgin with Lord Jesus Christ-- 
181,II,"Goes to the door, throws kisses to a child, "
182,II,"Goes to the window, smiles to some slim girl, "
183,II,And so returns and flashes kiss and smile 
184,II,"Into the canvas quaking 'neath his brush, "
185,II,Creating thus a masterpiece sublime. 
186,II,And then there's surly Michelangelo 
187,II,"Who chisels _Davids_ through the death-long night, "
188,II,And paints _Last Judgments_ through the livelong 
189,II,"day, "
190,II,"Pantingly running, pace on pace with Fame, "
191,II,Racing dean-limbed toward his goal in life. 
192,II,"But I, poor changeling, wake, and dream, and "
193,II,"wake, "
194,II,"And dream again, retarded by desire. "
195,II,I was eight years in painting at Milan 
196,II,A fresco for the monks of Dominic-- 
197,II,And even this I hear's begun to fade; 
198,II,It was a picture of that sacred feast 
199,II,Our Saviour gave before he went to die. 
200,II,Ten years I laboured on the Sforza horse 
201,II,Which should have been my monument through 
202,II,Time. 
203,II,"I built it huge and true in every line, "
204,II,"Studied anatomy to make it strong, "
205,II,And set on top Francesco with his sword; 
206,II,"But, when the time for casting had arrived "
207,II,"And I had done one perfect work at last, "
208,II,"The hungry French across the border came, "
209,II,"Bringing their Gascons, who got drunk and shot "
210,II,The clay of my poor Titan into space. 
211,II,So were ten years of strenuous effort lost; 
212,II,And now I'm painting Mona Lisa's face . . . 
213,II,_[Someone sings in the street below]_ 
214,II,"Seize then thy gladness ere it turns to dust, "
215,II,"Youth can make all acts lovely, all deeds just; "
216,II,"Heed not the tyrant, lean Morality, "
217,II,"But steer thy passion down to the purple sea, "
218,II,Through winding hills where Beauty hath her home 
219,II,"And calls to travellers, until thou come "
220,II,Unto the Deep of Lovés Satiety. 
221,II,_[Leonardo da Vinci speaks]_ 
222,II,"Ha-ha, my passion to the purple sea! "
223,II,"And yet, I'd go if Mona Lisa'd come. "
224,II,"We two, close-seated in one crimson boat "
225,II,"Would drift the yellow waters of Romance, "
226,II,Glide down its stream through hills of mystery 
227,II,"Where Beauty roams, of which the song hath "
228,II,"sung, "
229,II,Nor ever speak of where that tide should end. 
230,II,"We'd dip no oars, we'd set no hurrying sail, "
231,II,But swept on the full current of desire 
232,II,"Would steer our course with unimpeded hands, "
233,II,Watching the pleasure in each other's eyes. 
234,II,"Ah well, 'tis vain to talk! Two-thirds of life "
235,II,Till now I've spent in spotless purity-- 
236,II,Affection's been retarded by desire 
237,II,As has my work; my dreams have far excelled 
238,II,The beauty God moulds into human shape. 
239,II,The sweet perfection of the womankind 
240,II,"Who haunt my brain, has held me back from love. "
241,II,This . . . this was so till Mona Lisa came. 
242,II,"Four years I've painted when it was her day, "
243,II,"A day of mist, of mingled rain and sun; "
244,II,Four years before me silently she's sat 
245,II,And smiled to see me strive to catch her smile 
246,II,"In liquid paint, with canvas and with brush, "
247,II,"So that her eyes, searching, inscrutable, "
248,II,May question her sons' sons when she is dust. 
249,II,I only just begin to know her face. 
250,II,To learn its sudden changes I have paid 
251,II,"The skill'dest men in all our Tuscan vales, "
252,II,"Harpists, lute-players, masters of the viol, "
253,II,To make soft music while on her I gaze. 
254,II,For her content I ordered to be made 
255,II,A fountain in the courtyard of my house 
256,II,"Whose waters falling, ere they dash to spray, "
257,II,"Smite on smooth spheres, which thus revolve and "
258,II,hum 
259,II,The chaunt the winds toll in our upland pines. 
260,II,About the fountain's brink I caused to plant 
261,II,"Pale iris roots and dew-blanched narcissi, "
262,II,Since white's the flower which most of all she loves. 
263,II,"Also about the pillars, where the sun "
264,II,"Lengthens the shadows when the evening fades, "
265,II,I've sculptured . . . 
266,II,_[Someone sings in the street below]_ 
267,II,Passion's a flower 
268,II,While-leaf d or red-- 
269,II,None knows which colour 
270,II,Till it is dead; 
271,II,Love gives forth fragrance 
272,II,Pure as God's breath; 
273,II,Lust in Us dying 
274,II,Yields the gatherer death. 
275,II,_[Leonardo da Vinci speaks]_ 
276,II,And had Lorenzo sung those words to me 
277,II,His voice had had no more familiar sound; 
278,II,Had he turned back from lordly Paradise 
279,II,"To urge me on in my pursuit of Joy, "
280,II,"Knowing its flower almost within my hand, "
281,II,He had not said those words more earnestly. 
282,II,"Lo, even now he stands without and I, "
283,II,"By leaning forward, may discerrn his face. "
284,II,"_[Rises, goes to the window; looks out]_ "
285,II,"Nothing; the sky is covered with a cloud, "
286,II,The moon's obscured and all the stars are dead. 
287,II,"_[Cries, as though hailing someone]_ "
288,II,"Lorenzo, ho Lorenzo! Are you there? "
289,II,"I heard your singing. I am come, old friend. "
290,II,_[Listens; then to himself]_ 
291,II,What's over there? I thought a shadow stirred. 
292,II,"There, over there! Beneath Piero's wall. "
293,II,Hath Pagan Plato triumphed over Christ 
294,II,And sent his chief apostle back to us? 
295,II,Or hath Lord Christ in his compassion wrought 
296,II,"That kindness Dives craved of Abraham, "
297,II,Sending Lorenzo here from off his breast 
298,II,To bid me snatch my Joy ere Death befalls? 
299,II,"No . . . no, the moon shines through and makes "
300,II,all plain. 
301,II,This is some old Florentine Lazarus-- 
302,II,A soldier crippled in our Pisan wars 
303,II,Who begs upon San Marco's steps by day. 
304,II,"Hi, here's a scudot Catch it in your cap. "
305,II,D'you hear me fellow?_ 
306,II,"Strange, he does not stay, "
307,II,"But hastens on as if he . . . there, he's gone. "
308,II,"Perchance he's mad or deaf, or blind and mad. "
309,II,"And yet methought that, when he turned to go, "
310,II,"His face looked upward, so it caught the light; "
311,II,And it was like to one . . . 
312,II,_[Comes hack from the window and sits down]_ 
313,II,"Ah well, "
314,II,I'll think no more of spirits and of ghosts; 
315,II,Let the dead past go bury up its dead. 
316,II,I'll think of Mona Lisa's face alone . . . 
317,II,_Of Mona Lisa's face. 
318,II,Just now I said 
319,II,"One thing I knew, that I had never trod "
320,II,The quiet vale where grows the flower of white. 
321,II,'Twas false. Four years I've lived and wandered 
322,II,there 
323,II,"And seen my flower, but feared to break its stem. "
324,II,"Dear God, thou knowest how often I have prayed "
325,II,That this temptation might not make me fall-- 
326,II,"Yea, I have asked for death's deliverance. "
327,II,"Is this thy answer, that it is no sin "
328,II,For men to gather that which most they love? 
329,II,So be it. Silence answers every prayer; 
330,II,Thy voice hath spoken--I am satisfied. 
331,II,"Men say in Florence, while I watched her face, "
332,II,"That I bewitched her, so her very eyes "
333,II,"Grew in expression like unto my own, "
334,II,"So that her hands took on my restless ways, "
335,II,So that her mouth hath altered in its smile 
336,II,"And, when I paint her face, I paint my own. "
337,II,Then let that be God's answer to my prayer. 
338,II,"Ah, she is like me, she is very like! "
339,II,God made her for the sister of my soul; 
340,II,He would not have His plans jerked out of joint 
341,II,"By one mistake, because she chanced to wed "
342,II,Her bankrupt father's sternest creditor 
343,II,"To save his name--and this, some years ago; "
344,II,Therefore He sent His singer here to-night 
345,II,"That he, in words I loved, might tell me so. "
346,II,Certainly God is good and very great. 
347,II,"'Tis said her husband hath returned this night, "
348,II,Passing at sundown through the southern gate 
349,II,"From Naples, where last spring he went to sell "
350,II,Certain Sicilian cattle which he had. 
351,II,"(He sold, I'll warrant, at the highest price), "
352,II,"So, if the husband's come, then _she_ is home. "
353,II,"That day she left me, 'twas an April day, "
354,II,"One of her days of mingled mist and sun, "
355,II,I well remember how she paused and gazed 
356,II,"Full in my eyes, as if forbidden love "
357,II,Were vainly seeking words which shame denied; 
358,II,"Then suddenly she stooped, and her lips brushed "
359,II,"My forehead. God gave gentle words ; she prayed, "
360,II,"""May the Christ-Mother have you in her care""-- "
361,II,"Nothing besides. Passionately I rose up, "
362,II,Willing for her sake to be crucified; 
363,II,Stretched forth my arms to snatch her to my 
364,II,"breast, "
365,II,And found her gone--the courtyard filled with sun. 
366,II,Six months have passed since then--six tortured 
367,II,months! 
368,II,"There hangs her portrait, it has felt no brush "
369,II,Since on that April mom she went away; 
370,II,"And now the empty courtyard's filled with night, "
371,II,And back to Florence Mona Lisa's come. 
372,II,"To-morrow I will go to her and say, "
373,II,"""Lisa, here take my life for it is yours. "
374,II,Do with it as you will; but do not stay 
375,II,"To add, subtract, and reckon up its cost. "
376,II,"Act a brave part and, if your love's like mine, "
377,II,"We need not fear; for what we lose we gain, "
378,II,"And, though we gain much, still to-day's to-day "
379,II,"And, while we tarry, one day's love is lost."" "
380,II,"Ah, would that I might speak those words to-night "
381,II,"For, while I halt, another night is gone-- "
382,II,Crush'd to a mem'ry 'neath the heel of Time. 
383,II,"I'm minded even now to venture forth, "
384,II,"To go to her, although the hour is late; "
385,II,"And through the darkness, when she hears me call, "
386,II,"Only to say to her this one word, ""_Come_."" "
387,II,"Thus unto men speak Birth, Fate, Love and Death, "
388,II,The four great captains of this brief campaign; 
389,II,"Casting a shadow at the soul's tent-door, "
390,II,"Each in his turn beckons and whispers, ""_Come_."" "
391,II,"And I to her am Death, Birth, Love and Fate; "
392,II,"And she to me is Love, and only Love. "
393,II,I'll go to her. How can I longer wait? 
394,II,Her nearer presence sets my blood aflame; 
395,II,I'll seize my flower . . . 
396,II,"_[Commences to descend the stairway, then pauses]_ "
397,II,"Ah, the song again! "
398,II,_[Someone sings in the street below]_ 
399,II,"Let naught of fear Youth's laughing steps delay, "
400,II,"Aye, gather gladness; pluck it while ye may-- "
401,II,We burn not if To-morrow curse or Hess. 
402,II,"Who cares--one red bud more, one white bud less? "
403,II,"Only we burn that love was meant to spend, "
404,II,"And this we burn, that each life hath its end; "
405,II,"Therefore, O Youth, snatch all thy happiness. "
406,II,_[Descends slowly; passes out into the street]_ 
407,II,_[Leonardo da Vinci speaks]_ 
408,II,There's truth in every line that song hath sung. 
409,II,The hand that wrote it's twelve years turned to 
410,II,"dust, "
411,II,The brain's become a hollow nothingness-- 
412,II,A little grayness lying in a skull; 
413,II,And yet Lorenzo guides my steps to-night 
414,II,Unto my love as truly as in life. 
415,II,Oh wonderful and strange that men should die 
416,II,"And, being buried, still should talk with us! "
417,II,"When _I_ am free, and future ages come "
418,II,"To stand amazed before the girl I loved, "
419,II,"Then I will speak with them, say thus and thus, "
420,II,"And, though departed, never shall be dead. "
421,II,"For this I'll paint her portrait till 'tis done, "
422,II,"Singing, like Raphael, from gray dawn to dusk, "
423,II,"Pausing to kiss her forehead, lips, throat, eyes, "
424,II,"Learning their beauty, where mine own lips touch; "
425,II,"So I, like Angelo, with measured stride "
426,II,"Will race with Fame, until the prize is won. "
427,II,"Yea, men attain most only when they love. "
428,II,"""_But steer thy passion down to the purple sea,_"" "
429,II,"(How went the song?) ""_Until at length thou come "
430,II,"Unto the Deep of Love's Satiety_."" "
431,II,"Truly, that is the way that brave men love: "
432,II,"Reckless of blame, despising consequence, "
433,II,"Not counting on a better day to come, "
434,II,Seizing with warrior-hands their Joy at once. 
435,II,"And love in life is everything to us, "
436,II,And I have failed because I have not loved. 
437,II,"But, when her soft arms go about my neck "
438,II,"And I grow pale before her great desire, "
439,II,A new success will pass into my blood 
440,II,And I'll be strong . . . 
441,II,"Ah, someone's coming up! "
442,II,I'll draw into the shadow of this gate; 
443,II,Perhaps he'll pass. I seem to know his tread. 
444,II,No good! He's seen me; I must seek the light. 
445,II,Is't you Vitelli? 
446,II,_[Vitelli]_ 
447,II,Leonardo? 
448,II,_[Leonardo da Vinci]_ 
449,II,Yes. 
450,II,_[Vitelli speaks]_ 
451,II,"Well, how's the painting? Is her portrait done? "
452,II,"Whose portrait? Why, the one of Lisa's face. "
453,II,"Not finished! What, 'tis only just begun? "
454,II,"Well, that's a pity. Four years seems some time "
455,II,To gape before a canvas with a brush. 
456,II,Beg pardon. This is what I meant to say: 
457,II,"That since you could not paint her in her life, "
458,II,You'll scarce be more successful now she's 
459,II,dead . . . 
460,II,"You did not know? . . . _Why, she's been dead "
461,II,three months._

463,CENTURIES AGO,"In the solemn twilight, centuries ago, "
464,CENTURIES AGO,"God walked in His Garden, all His stars below; "

467,CENTURIES AGO,"Man roamed through the twilight, centuries ago, "

471,CENTURIES AGO,"Woman, who was half-God, centuries ago. "
472,CENTURIES AGO,"These, within God's Garden, centuries ago, "
473,CENTURIES AGO,Stood beneath the twilight calling very low 
474,CENTURIES AGO,"To some voice to answer, whereby they might "
475,CENTURIES AGO,know 
476,CENTURIES AGO,Had God really made them--centuries ago. 
477,CENTURIES AGO,"Thus whilst they were listening, centuries ago, "
478,CENTURIES AGO,"Solemn feet drew nigh them, treading very slow; "
479,CENTURIES AGO,Solemn hands so touched them that they caused to 
480,CENTURIES AGO,grow 
481,CENTURIES AGO,"Something that was All-God, centuries ago. "
482,CENTURIES AGO,"Then they left God's Garden, centuries ago. "
483,CENTURIES AGO,"Scarcely dared to question, never hoped to know, "
484,CENTURIES AGO,"Who it was that touched them, causing thus to "
485,CENTURIES AGO,grow 
486,CENTURIES AGO,"That small child, so like them--centuries ago. "

499,HIS MOTHER,We two walked hand-in-hand 
500,HIS MOTHER,"Close to God's Hidden Land, "
501,HIS MOTHER,Jesus and I. 
502,HIS MOTHER,This little son of mine

574,A BRAVE LIFE,A BRAVE LIFE 
575,A BRAVE LIFE,"The arid loneliness of life he knew, "
576,A BRAVE LIFE,"The doubtful darkness of the starless night, "
577,A BRAVE LIFE,And fear lest he should never see the sight 
578,A BRAVE LIFE,Of dawn and God the Father breaking through. 
579,A BRAVE LIFE,Brave offspring of a disenchanted age 
580,A BRAVE LIFE,He lived as though illusion were not dead; 
581,A BRAVE LIFE,His was the pain of faiths discredited 
582,A BRAVE LIFE,Which with new knowledge civil battles wage. 
583,A BRAVE LIFE,In all his deeds for righteous quests he stood 
584,A BRAVE LIFE,"And we, who watched his face and heard his voice, "
585,A BRAVE LIFE,"Dreamed of the Christ; we had not any choice, "
586,A BRAVE LIFE,In loving him we knew that God was good-- 
587,A BRAVE LIFE,"We knew. And thus, beneath the hooded sky, "
588,A BRAVE LIFE,Lightly we followed where his pain had made 
589,A BRAVE LIFE,"A path for us; if one should fall, he stayed "
590,A BRAVE LIFE,"To raise him, lest his frailer hope should die. "
591,A BRAVE LIFE,Ofttimes when summer's day had ceased to shine 
592,A BRAVE LIFE,"And on our London roofs the moon looked down, "
593,A BRAVE LIFE,We two would wander through the gas-lit town 
594,A BRAVE LIFE,Speaking in whispers of the things divine; 
595,A BRAVE LIFE,"Or in love's stillness, high above the strife, "
596,A BRAVE LIFE,"We found our spirits strangely catching fire, "
597,A BRAVE LIFE,"And told of that ""_ unspeakable desire "

599,A BRAVE LIFE,He knows its secret now; the morning mist

753,WHY THEY LOVED HIM,"Though blind we were with shameful sin, "
754,WHY THEY LOVED HIM,"He touched our eyes with tears, and then "
755,WHY THEY LOVED HIM,Led God's tall angels flaming in.

776,WHY THEY LOVED HIM,"Without reproof or word of blame, "
777,WHY THEY LOVED HIM,"As mothers do in childhood's years, "

781,WHY THEY LOVED HIM,"(We had not learnt to love before), "

926,_A ROMANCE_,"_""Bianca of the yellow hair, "
927,_A ROMANCE_,"With witch-face white as ivory, "
928,_A ROMANCE_,Yield to our might that we may bear 
929,_A ROMANCE_,"Thy body back to Rimini.""_ "
930,_A ROMANCE_,And thus the foemen cried all day 
931,_A ROMANCE_,And strove to daunt with fierce display 
932,_A ROMANCE_,"Of armoured strength her maiden heart, "
933,_A ROMANCE_,So that with them she might depart 
934,_A ROMANCE_,From out that hill-tower where with three 
935,_A ROMANCE_,She'd held the pass right fearlessly-- 
936,_A ROMANCE_,So that with them she might depart 
937,_A ROMANCE_,To shameful death in Rimini. 
938,_A ROMANCE_,"Bianca, child of Abramo "
939,_A ROMANCE_,"The despot lord of Reggio, "
940,_A ROMANCE_,Had set our country-side on flame 
941,_A ROMANCE_,"With the binning torch of her beauty's fame, "
942,_A ROMANCE_,And a deadman's hate of her deadly name. 
943,_A ROMANCE_,For she had gazed with cold gray eyes 
944,_A ROMANCE_,On Rufo--he now starkly lies 
945,_A ROMANCE_,"Deep in a sculptured sepulchre, "
946,_A ROMANCE_,Smitten with death through love of her. 
947,_A ROMANCE_,"Rufo, the heir of Ugo Count "
948,_A ROMANCE_,Qf Rimini and vast amount 
949,_A ROMANCE_,"Of warrior-men and chivalry, "
950,_A ROMANCE_,Had come to claim her haughtily; 
951,_A ROMANCE_,But had scorched his soul in her golden hair. 
952,_A ROMANCE_,"As a wounded beast creeps to his lair, "
953,_A ROMANCE_,So he vilely died by slow degrees 
954,_A ROMANCE_,"Of heart-break and a sore disease, "
955,_A ROMANCE_,"Till his eyes grew glazed and ceased to stir, "
956,_A ROMANCE_,And his life gave out for his love of her. 
957,_A ROMANCE_,"Then Ugo swore a mighty oath, "
958,_A ROMANCE_,"By God's own Christ and by Christ's truth, "
959,_A ROMANCE_,"Though I go unarmed and go alone, "
960,_A ROMANCE_,For my son's death she shall atone. 
961,_A ROMANCE_,I'll take this witch of Reggio 
962,_A ROMANCE_,"And through the flames will make her go, "
963,_A ROMANCE_,"Till her sweet red lips grow cracked and sere, "
964,_A ROMANCE_,"Till her eyes are scarred and mad with fear, "
965,_A ROMANCE_,Till her false young tongue cannot speak love's 
966,_A ROMANCE_,"name, "
967,_A ROMANCE_,Till her tender feet drop off with flame-- 
968,_A ROMANCE_,Till she hath naught left that men desire 
969,_A ROMANCE_,"She shall pass and pass through consuming fire."" "
970,_A ROMANCE_,This was the oath which he did swear 
971,_A ROMANCE_,When he cursed her face in his hate of her. 
972,_A ROMANCE_,So Ugo rode on Reggio 
973,_A ROMANCE_,"And called on the name of Abramo, "
974,_A ROMANCE_,Claiming the body of her who wrought 
975,_A ROMANCE_,Love's enchantments and made distraught 
976,_A ROMANCE_,"The souls of the lovers who came to her, "
977,_A ROMANCE_,And told of the oath which he did swear. 
978,_A ROMANCE_,They bade him stand without the wall 
979,_A ROMANCE_,And bore his tidings to the hall. 
980,_A ROMANCE_,"From early mom he stood till eve, "
981,_A ROMANCE_,And still no message did receive. 
982,_A ROMANCE_,"When night was falling, dusk and dim, "
983,_A ROMANCE_,A city harlot drew nigh to him 
984,_A ROMANCE_,"And grayly glimmered along the wall, "
985,_A ROMANCE_,And stopped where the Count was standing tall. 
986,_A ROMANCE_,"What news,"" he cried, ""from Abramo, "
987,_A ROMANCE_,"Must I raze this city of Reggio?"" "
988,_A ROMANCE_,He reared his plume to its towering height. 
989,_A ROMANCE_,She leaned far out in the waning light. 
990,_A ROMANCE_,He clutched with one hand his saddle-bow 
991,_A ROMANCE_,"And saw her smile when she answered, ""No,"" "
992,_A ROMANCE_,And spat on his face and strained down on 
993,_A ROMANCE_,him. 
994,_A ROMANCE_,He rode away 'neath the crescent rim 
995,_A ROMANCE_,"Of a new-made moon through an olive-grove, "
996,_A ROMANCE_,And evil passions within him strove; 
997,_A ROMANCE_,In anger he gained the shining sea 
998,_A ROMANCE_,Which silvers the shores of Rimini. 
999,_A ROMANCE_,"There he made great stir and called out his men, "
1000,_A ROMANCE_,"And marshalled their ranks on a level fen, "
1001,_A ROMANCE_,And clothed them in black and gave beside 
1002,_A ROMANCE_,"His knights black stallions which to ride, "
1003,_A ROMANCE_,"And ordered no singing. ""For,"" said he, "
1004,_A ROMANCE_,"We mourn one dead in Rimini."" "
1005,_A ROMANCE_,Over the hills he caused to go 
1006,_A ROMANCE_,His sombre ranks to Reggio; 
1007,_A ROMANCE_,Through pleasant valleys and dew-drenched woods 
1008,_A ROMANCE_,His horsemen paced in their sable hoods 
1009,_A ROMANCE_,"With no shrill of bugle or revelry, "
1010,_A ROMANCE_,Like angels of Death's dread company. 
1011,_A ROMANCE_,At night they stole to the dty-wall 
1012,_A ROMANCE_,And clustered beneath the ramparts tall; 
1013,_A ROMANCE_,"And hearkened for noise of warlike din, "
1014,_A ROMANCE_,And found no breath of strife within; 
1015,_A ROMANCE_,"And watched for lights in the houses' eyes, "
1016,_A ROMANCE_,And saw but the stars within the skies. 
1017,_A ROMANCE_,"Then as one voice they raised the shout, "
1018,_A ROMANCE_,"The echo eddied their cry about, "
1019,_A ROMANCE_,We call on you men of Reggio 
1020,_A ROMANCE_,"To give us the daughter of Abramo, "
1021,_A ROMANCE_,That she pass and pass through consuming fire 
1022,_A ROMANCE_,Till she hath naught left that men desire. 
1023,_A ROMANCE_,"Give us the daughter of Abramo."" "
1024,_A ROMANCE_,"Swift and dread, dark-robed and dim, "
1025,_A ROMANCE_,"Like thunder about a crater's brim, "
1026,_A ROMANCE_,They surged round the city at dead of night 
1027,_A ROMANCE_,"And chased their shadows in stately flight, "
1028,_A ROMANCE_,"And swept the circle with beating hoof, "
1029,_A ROMANCE_,And flashed their blades on high as proof 
1030,_A ROMANCE_,Of the hate they had; nor ceased to moan 
1031,_A ROMANCE_,"Like men long dead 'neath the charnel-stone, "
1032,_A ROMANCE_,"Give us the daughter of Abramo."" "
1033,_A ROMANCE_,"The dawn was groping up the sky, "
1034,_A ROMANCE_,An early bird was heard to cry; 
1035,_A ROMANCE_,Forth from the gate with haunted eyes 
1036,_A ROMANCE_,"Four figures crept in leper's guise, "
1037,_A ROMANCE_,And two had long and yellow hair 
1038,_A ROMANCE_,And none had face or body bare. 
1039,_A ROMANCE_,Swiftly they ran from tree to tree 
1040,_A ROMANCE_,And wound their way all secretly 
1041,_A ROMANCE_,"Through gloom and grove to the rising sun, "
1042,_A ROMANCE_,And through that day did onward run 
1043,_A ROMANCE_,"Till evening came, and they drew at length "
1044,_A ROMANCE_,To the lonely might and granite strength 
1045,_A ROMANCE_,Of the hill-tower in the narrow pass 
1046,_A ROMANCE_,Where refuge and a safety was. 
1047,_A ROMANCE_,Then did they lock and bar the door 
1048,_A ROMANCE_,"And armed themselves, for they knew before "
1049,_A ROMANCE_,Another moon should flood the sky 
1050,_A ROMANCE_,"They would hear Count Ugo's hunting cry, "
1051,_A ROMANCE_,"Yield to us, daughter of Abramo."" "
1052,_A ROMANCE_,"Two frail maids, two boyish men, "
1053,_A ROMANCE_,Lovers all in the good days when 
1054,_A ROMANCE_,Only the sun was in the sky 
1055,_A ROMANCE_,Nor clouds of grief came trailing by; 
1056,_A ROMANCE_,Two brave maids and two brave men 
1057,_A ROMANCE_,"Now, in an hour of darkness, when "
1058,_A ROMANCE_,Only the clouds were in the sky 
1059,_A ROMANCE_,Loved more dearly than formerly. 
1060,_A ROMANCE_,"Corrado, page of Bianca's court, "
1061,_A ROMANCE_,Had loved his mistress and long had sought 
1062,_A ROMANCE_,"To speak his heart but feared, for he "
1063,_A ROMANCE_,Was a love-child owned of no family. 
1064,_A ROMANCE_,"Celia was her half-sister, "
1065,_A ROMANCE_,"Wondrous sweet and like to her, "
1066,_A ROMANCE_,So like that she had fled lest she 
1067,_A ROMANCE_,For Bianca's self should mistaken be. 
1068,_A ROMANCE_,"Ciro, son of a noble name, "
1069,_A ROMANCE_,"Loved this girl, therefore he came "
1070,_A ROMANCE_,"To give his life, if need should be, "
1071,_A ROMANCE_,He loved her life so utterly. 
1072,_A ROMANCE_,Oft in the hush of a summer's night 
1073,_A ROMANCE_,When earth has rest from the savage might 
1074,_A ROMANCE_,"Of flaming suns, and starlight sheds "
1075,_A ROMANCE_,"Kindness of dew on flowers' heads, "
1076,_A ROMANCE_,"And birds have got them away to rest, "
1077,_A ROMANCE_,These lads had whispered breast to breast 
1078,_A ROMANCE_,Of the joy they felt and happy thrills 
1079,_A ROMANCE_,When they heard so much as the shaken frills 
1080,_A ROMANCE_,Of these they loved in the passing by; 
1081,_A ROMANCE_,"And then, betwixt a sob and sigh, "
1082,_A ROMANCE_,Had dreamed of a day when they should wed. 
1083,_A ROMANCE_,"Vain dream! Vain dream! now here, instead, "
1084,_A ROMANCE_,With Bianca fled to the hill-side tower 
1085,_A ROMANCE_,"They should strain and hearken hour by hour, "
1086,_A ROMANCE_,"With clutching hands and bated breath, "
1087,_A ROMANCE_,"For man's last bride--the Woman, Death. "
1088,_A ROMANCE_,And thus they sat a lengthy while 
1089,_A ROMANCE_,Till one face lit with a wandering smile: 
1090,_A ROMANCE_,"Come now, my lords,"" Bianca said, "
1091,_A ROMANCE_,Why sit ye heavy-eyed and sad? 
1092,_A ROMANCE_,Men say ye each have loved a maid; 
1093,_A ROMANCE_,"Surely, I think, I should be glad "
1094,_A ROMANCE_,To draw so near for an hour or two 
1095,_A ROMANCE_,"The maid I loved, though well I knew "
1096,_A ROMANCE_,"The early mom should find me dead."" "
1097,_A ROMANCE_,"Then he who loved her, laughed and said, "
1098,_A ROMANCE_,"Yea, lady mine, I will be bold "
1099,_A ROMANCE_,Too long my love hath lain untold; 
1100,_A ROMANCE_,Yet mine was not an unshared sorrow 
1101,_A ROMANCE_,But grief for thine and thy sad to-morrow 
1102,_A ROMANCE_,"If my lord, thy father, fail to send "
1103,_A ROMANCE_,"His cavalry."" "
1104,_A ROMANCE_,'God will defend 
1105,_A ROMANCE_,"His maid,"" she said, ""God will provide. "
1106,_A ROMANCE_,"But, if to Rimini I ride, "
1107,_A ROMANCE_,"I shall be glad recalling this, "
1108,_A ROMANCE_,That thou did'st not withhold thy kiss 
1109,_A ROMANCE_,"When all my loves had forsaken me."" "
1110,_A ROMANCE_,"Aye love, brief love, sweet love,"" sighed he, "
1111,_A ROMANCE_,"Thou art more than life--far more, far more."" "
1112,_A ROMANCE_,"So through that night, by the fast-locked door, "
1113,_A ROMANCE_,"They spake of lové till they drooped to sleep, "
1114,_A ROMANCE_,Nor heard at dawn the wary creep 
1115,_A ROMANCE_,"Of one who traced the outer-wall, "
1116,_A ROMANCE_,And found the marks of their foot-fall. 
1117,_A ROMANCE_,When mists were lifting off the sky 
1118,_A ROMANCE_,"They sprang from dreams at a sudden cry, "
1119,_A ROMANCE_,And gazed with startled eyes around: 
1120,_A ROMANCE_,"""'Tis naught,"" they laughed, ""'twas a country "
1121,_A ROMANCE_,sound-- 
1122,_A ROMANCE_,"A late-awakened bird did call, "
1123,_A ROMANCE_,A wind blew through the water-fall. 
1124,_A ROMANCE_,"'Tis naught--'tis naught."" "
1125,_A ROMANCE_,But afar they heard 
1126,_A ROMANCE_,A wail not made by beast or bird; 
1127,_A ROMANCE_,"A hungry moan, long-drawn and low, "
1128,_A ROMANCE_,"""Give us the daughter of Abramo."" "
1129,_A ROMANCE_,She stretched her arms along the wall 
1130,_A ROMANCE_,"And leant aside as she would fall, "
1131,_A ROMANCE_,And cowered low 'neath her yellow hair 
1132,_A ROMANCE_,As though its weight were too much to bear. 
1133,_A ROMANCE_,"And, ""Oh, sweet God, dear God,"" she cried, "
1134,_A ROMANCE_,"Hark how they come! They ride, they ride! "
1135,_A ROMANCE_,What ill have I ever done to Thee 
1136,_A ROMANCE_,That men should bum my fair body? 
1137,_A ROMANCE_,"Stoop from Thy skies and succour me."" "
1138,_A ROMANCE_,"""Yea, God hath stooped. Fear not, dear heart, "
1139,_A ROMANCE_,"For I and Ciro will play God's part, "
1140,_A ROMANCE_,And Celia sweet shall comfort thee 
1141,_A ROMANCE_,"While we brand these dogs of Rimini."" "
1142,_A ROMANCE_,With hurried feet they clomb the stair 
1143,_A ROMANCE_,"And quickly gained the outer air, "
1144,_A ROMANCE_,And ghostly saw through the morning haze 
1145,_A ROMANCE_,The winding funeral arrays 
1146,_A ROMANCE_,Of Ugo's knights and warrior-men. 
1147,_A ROMANCE_,"Dumbly they watched, and heard often "
1148,_A ROMANCE_,Their hunting cry borne down the breeze. 
1149,_A ROMANCE_,"Corrado laughed with an ugly ease, "
1150,_A ROMANCE_,And thus it is he comes with these: 
1151,_A ROMANCE_,"Strong stallions, lances, Genoese-- "
1152,_A ROMANCE_,To take one slim and fragrant girl! 
1153,_A ROMANCE_,"Oh, Ciro mine, our hands shall hurl "
1154,_A ROMANCE_,"These valiant fighters from the wall, "
1155,_A ROMANCE_,Though we be lads and they be tall. 
1156,_A ROMANCE_,"If God there be above us all, "
1157,_A ROMANCE_,"Then love shall give us strength this day."" "
1158,_A ROMANCE_,Down on the stones they kneeled to pray 
1159,_A ROMANCE_,That He who brought their lives to be 
1160,_A ROMANCE_,Should crown their loves with victory. 
1161,_A ROMANCE_,They rose and flew their heraldry: 
1162,_A ROMANCE_,"An evening star, a saffron sea, "
1163,_A ROMANCE_,"And on the sea, the star below, "
1164,_A ROMANCE_,The dry-shod pard of Reggio. 
1165,_A ROMANCE_,"No answer made the sable foe, "
1166,_A ROMANCE_,"But round the tower, with footsteps slow, "
1167,_A ROMANCE_,Paced till his journeys numbered three; 
1168,_A ROMANCE_,"Then from the host one silently, "
1169,_A ROMANCE_,"Thrust on a spear for mockery, "
1170,_A ROMANCE_,And raised the head of Abramo. 
1171,_A ROMANCE_,Swift round the tower in mirthless rout 
1172,_A ROMANCE_,"They raced and tossed the words about, "
1173,_A ROMANCE_,"_""Bianca of the yellow hair, "
1174,_A ROMANCE_,"With witch-face white as ivory, "
1175,_A ROMANCE_,Yield to our might that we may bear 
1176,_A ROMANCE_,"Thy body back to Rimini,_"" "
1177,_A ROMANCE_,'Twas thus the foemen cried all day 
1178,_A ROMANCE_,And strove to daunt with fierce display 
1179,_A ROMANCE_,"Of armoured strength her maiden heart, "
1180,_A ROMANCE_,So that with them she might depart 
1181,_A ROMANCE_,To shameful death in Rimini. 
1182,_A ROMANCE_,"Bianca, in the vault below, "
1183,_A ROMANCE_,Crouched at her prayers and did not know 
1184,_A ROMANCE_,"This death, and of her father's shame; "
1185,_A ROMANCE_,But heard their shouts and heard her name. 
1186,_A ROMANCE_,"Oh, little hands,"" she softly sighed, "
1187,_A ROMANCE_,"Wherefore should ye be crucified, "
1188,_A ROMANCE_,What have ye done that men should see 
1189,_A ROMANCE_,"Naught in your grace, save witchery? "
1190,_A ROMANCE_,"Oh, yellow hair, so like the sun, "
1191,_A ROMANCE_,What is this sin that thou hast done 
1192,_A ROMANCE_,That men should have such hate of thee? 
1193,_A ROMANCE_,"And sweet grave face of ivory, "
1194,_A ROMANCE_,"So made for love and for desire, "
1195,_A ROMANCE_,Why should they crave thee for the fire? 
1196,_A ROMANCE_,"Fire of love was meant for thee."" "
1197,_A ROMANCE_,Her sister bent and kissed the hands 
1198,_A ROMANCE_,"Which hung straight down like two white wands, "
1199,_A ROMANCE_,"And hid her lips in a yellow tress, "
1200,_A ROMANCE_,"And kissed the breasts where they met the dress, "
1201,_A ROMANCE_,And laid her cheek on the weary face 
1202,_A ROMANCE_,"To wipe away each tear's distress, "
1203,_A ROMANCE_,To cleanse of grief each grievous place. 
1204,_A ROMANCE_,"And this for thee,"" she said and kissed. "
1205,_A ROMANCE_,"And this for thee,"" and held each wrist. "
1206,_A ROMANCE_,"And this for thee,"" and met the lips. "
1207,_A ROMANCE_,As priest in sacred water dips 
1208,_A ROMANCE_,His hand at last confessional 
1209,_A ROMANCE_,To purge each thoroughfare of sense 
1210,_A ROMANCE_,"And bring again lost innocence, "
1211,_A ROMANCE_,So she made pure and perfect all. 
1212,_A ROMANCE_,Shrill through their peace shrieked the battle- 
1213,_A ROMANCE_,"call, "
1214,_A ROMANCE_,Per Jesum Christum! Reggio! 
1215,_A ROMANCE_,"Have at them Death! They fall, they fall!"" "
1216,_A ROMANCE_,"And hoarse, hard-breathed, the wall below, "
1217,_A ROMANCE_,"Surged up the wrath of the hungry foe, "
1218,_A ROMANCE_,"Give USs the daughter of Abramo."" "
1219,_A ROMANCE_,"Fierce through that day the struggle went, "
1220,_A ROMANCE_,And blood was spilt and swords were bent. 
1221,_A ROMANCE_,The sun sank bloody in the West; 
1222,_A ROMANCE_,The day died bitter and unblest. 
1223,_A ROMANCE_,The mountains strained against the sky 
1224,_A ROMANCE_,"And angrily, as they would try "
1225,_A ROMANCE_,To wrench from earth their trampled gowns. 
1226,_A ROMANCE_,An eagle o'er the upland downs 
1227,_A ROMANCE_,"Hung poised, then beat his wings, as he "
1228,_A ROMANCE_,Refused to share man's cruelty. 
1229,_A ROMANCE_,"At nightfall, when the host withdrew, "
1230,_A ROMANCE_,"A spearman, whom they counted dead, "
1231,_A ROMANCE_,In dying strength raised up his head 
1232,_A ROMANCE_,"And sped a poisoned dart, which slew "
1233,_A ROMANCE_,"Ciro, who from the tower's height "
1234,_A ROMANCE_,Leaned out to watch the evening light. 
1235,_A ROMANCE_,And thus of four there remained but three. 
1236,_A ROMANCE_,Celia clomb the winding stair 
1237,_A ROMANCE_,And thought of how her yellow hair 
1238,_A ROMANCE_,"Could save the three, if she should dare "
1239,_A ROMANCE_,To yield herself to Rimini. 
1240,_A ROMANCE_,"For I am very like to her,"" "
1241,_A ROMANCE_,"She said, ""so like that if I were "
1242,_A ROMANCE_,To feign myself for my sister 
1243,_A ROMANCE_,"By night--this night if I should go, "
1244,_A ROMANCE_,I think the Count would never know 
1245,_A ROMANCE_,"Till they were safe and I was burned."" "
1246,_A ROMANCE_,The last bend in the stair she turned 
1247,_A ROMANCE_,"And halted as she gained the roof, "
1248,_A ROMANCE_,And stretched her gaze abroad for proof 
1249,_A ROMANCE_,Of where her lover might keep guard. 
1250,_A ROMANCE_,"There, where a shafted moonbeam barred "
1251,_A ROMANCE_,"An alcove of gray masonry, "
1252,_A ROMANCE_,"His face shone out, so tranquilly "
1253,_A ROMANCE_,She thought him sleeping; but his eyes 
1254,_A ROMANCE_,"Were wide, intent on her and wise "
1255,_A ROMANCE_,Beyond the sight of living men. 
1256,_A ROMANCE_,"Softly she called to him and, when "
1257,_A ROMANCE_,"He answered not, 'twas then she knew. . . "
1258,_A ROMANCE_,"She kissed his forehead, and withdrew "
1259,_A ROMANCE_,Her tired feet adown the stair. 
1260,_A ROMANCE_,Bianca kneeled entranced in prayer 
1261,_A ROMANCE_,"And noticed not her passing by, "
1262,_A ROMANCE_,But counted fast her rosaRy. 
1263,_A ROMANCE_,"Corrado, touched upon the arm, "
1264,_A ROMANCE_,Reeled as he turned in fierce alarm. 
1265,_A ROMANCE_,"She said, ""We change the watch this hour. "
1266,_A ROMANCE_,"I will abide; guard you the tower."" "
1267,_A ROMANCE_,"Then, as he set his foot to go, "
1268,_A ROMANCE_,"Kiss me, dear friend, for you must know "
1269,_A ROMANCE_,"We may not ever meet again, "
1270,_A ROMANCE_,"This war has brought us so much pain."" "
1271,_A ROMANCE_,"He gazed on her a tender while, "
1272,_A ROMANCE_,And wondered at the gracious smile 
1273,_A ROMANCE_,"Around her lips. ""While we are four,"" "
1274,_A ROMANCE_,"He said, ""we need not fear this war; "
1275,_A ROMANCE_,"Love is more than life ... far more, far more."" "
1276,_A ROMANCE_,"She answered, ""Not while we are four."" "
1277,_A ROMANCE_,"Ah, have no fear at all,"" he said; "
1278,_A ROMANCE_,"""She prays for us, see how her head "
1279,_A ROMANCE_,"Is bowed in reverence to God."" "
1280,_A ROMANCE_,He took his sword and clanking trod 
1281,_A ROMANCE_,"The stone-paved vault and winding stair, "
1282,_A ROMANCE_,Till she could judge him mounting where 
1283,_A ROMANCE_,Another turn would bring to sight 
1284,_A ROMANCE_,Her dead love's face in the shafted light 
1285,_A ROMANCE_,Where the moonbeam washed the turret white. 
1286,_A ROMANCE_,"She bared her feet and crept the floor, "
1287,_A ROMANCE_,"With eager hands wrenched loose the door, "
1288,_A ROMANCE_,And weeping passed into the night. 
1289,_A ROMANCE_,The dawn thrust up a wild white face 
1290,_A ROMANCE_,"And stared toward the lonely place, "
1291,_A ROMANCE_,"Where through the vigil, hour by hour, "
1292,_A ROMANCE_,Corrado guarded well the tower. 
1293,_A ROMANCE_,"It seemed his own reflected face, "
1294,_A ROMANCE_,So wannish and so wide of eye; 
1295,_A ROMANCE_,"The lips moved and he caught their sigh, "
1296,_A ROMANCE_,"I am thyself and I must die."" "
1297,_A ROMANCE_,"Thus did he learn the uttermost, "
1298,_A ROMANCE_,"The live man meeting his own ghost, "
1299,_A ROMANCE_,And knew that surely he must die. 
1300,_A ROMANCE_,The sun flashed up; the face was fled. 
1301,_A ROMANCE_,By night he knew he must be dead. 
1302,_A ROMANCE_,He leaned beyond the parapet 
1303,_A ROMANCE_,To scan the rocky pass if yet 
1304,_A ROMANCE_,Some help might wind around the hill. 
1305,_A ROMANCE_,The morning air was very still; 
1306,_A ROMANCE_,"He heard the noise of climbing feet, "
1307,_A ROMANCE_,"Of something dragged across the peat, "
1308,_A ROMANCE_,"And saw two knights who, drawing near, "
1309,_A ROMANCE_,Bore that which clogged his heart with fear-- 
1310,_A ROMANCE_,"A white gown, sown with golden threads "
1311,_A ROMANCE_,Which held the light as do the meads 
1312,_A ROMANCE_,When dandelions toss their heads 
1313,_A ROMANCE_,"Mid meadow-sweet and field-clover, "
1314,_A ROMANCE_,Which poppy-leaves drift red over-- 
1315,_A ROMANCE_,"A long white gown and smirched with red, "
1316,_A ROMANCE_,"And hands so still, they must be dead. "
1317,_A ROMANCE_,They laid her on a grass-grown bank 
1318,_A ROMANCE_,"And loosed about her neck the stole, "
1319,_A ROMANCE_,So that her gold hair round her sank 
1320,_A ROMANCE_,To frame a burning aureole.- 
1321,_A ROMANCE_,"How now, ye dogs of Rimini, "
1322,_A ROMANCE_,What crime is this that ye have done 
1323,_A ROMANCE_,"To show to God's new-risen sun, "
1324,_A ROMANCE_,"Which he will tell God secretly?"" "
1325,_A ROMANCE_,"And one in shame drew back a pace, "
1326,_A ROMANCE_,"And one raised up his vizored face, "
1327,_A ROMANCE_,"No crime, Sir Knave. God's work, I trow. "
1328,_A ROMANCE_,"Give us the witch, and we will go-- "
1329,_A ROMANCE_,"The match to this, from Reggio."" "
1330,_A ROMANCE_,"We have no witch, as well ye know."" "
1331,_A ROMANCE_,"But, as he spake, he heard with pain "
1332,_A ROMANCE_,Their scornful laugh. 
1333,_A ROMANCE_,"To make things plain, "
1334,_A ROMANCE_,The black knight pitched his voice and said 
1335,_A ROMANCE_,"And pointed, ""Ho sir, turn your head; "
1336,_A ROMANCE_,"The witch stands by you even now."" "
1337,_A ROMANCE_,The world across his eyes and brow 
1338,_A ROMANCE_,"Streamed scarlet. By his side she stood, "
1339,_A ROMANCE_,Her eyes bent on a distant wood 
1340,_A ROMANCE_,"Wherein the shadows came and went, "
1341,_A ROMANCE_,Where horsemen from their stallions leant 
1342,_A ROMANCE_,All eager for the bugle cry. 
1343,_A ROMANCE_,"We fight in vain,"" he heard her sigh, "
1344,_A ROMANCE_,"God wills it thus, that I should die."" "
1345,_A ROMANCE_,"Nay, courage, sweetheart, while I stand "
1346,_A ROMANCE_,With strength to grasp a sword in hand 
1347,_A ROMANCE_,"No harm shall come thee nigh nor by."" "
1348,_A ROMANCE_,But she had seen that on the hill 
1349,_A ROMANCE_,"Which made her moan, so that she still "
1350,_A ROMANCE_,"Kept looking and, ""Oh, Christ,"" she sobbed, "
1351,_A ROMANCE_,"What is that thing so palely robed?"" "
1352,_A ROMANCE_,Her shadow slid throughout the space 
1353,_A ROMANCE_,Until it reached across the face 
1354,_A ROMANCE_,"Of that dead maid, until their lips "
1355,_A ROMANCE_,"Strained to the kiss, their finger-tips "
1356,_A ROMANCE_,Met at the touch. 
1357,_A ROMANCE_,The enemy 
1358,_A ROMANCE_,"Shouted, ""A witch, yea, verily, "
1359,_A ROMANCE_,"See how her shade feeds on the dead."" "
1360,_A ROMANCE_,"Oh, I must go to her,"" she said: "
1361,_A ROMANCE_,"She sleeps alone, alone, alone."" "
1362,_A ROMANCE_,"Her thin hands grazed against the stone, "
1363,_A ROMANCE_,"So blindly did she walk, her throat "
1364,_A ROMANCE_,"Stretched back, her hair far out did float "
1365,_A ROMANCE_,Like sun-clouds following the sun. 
1366,_A ROMANCE_,"He followed her, passed down the stair, "
1367,_A ROMANCE_,On through the vault and halted where 
1368,_A ROMANCE_,She paused to swing the iron door; 
1369,_A ROMANCE_,"Then, out upon the trampled moor. "
1370,_A ROMANCE_,"There, where the dead girl lay, she knelt "
1371,_A ROMANCE_,And made of her fair arms a belt 
1372,_A ROMANCE_,"Around the corse; there, with her hair, "
1373,_A ROMANCE_,Wiped clean the face of earth and blood; 
1374,_A ROMANCE_,"There, with her mouth, rebuked the stare "
1375,_A ROMANCE_,"Of those strange eyes; last, made all good "
1376,_A ROMANCE_,By placing in the hands for rood 
1377,_A ROMANCE_,That which she pluck't from out the breast. 
1378,_A ROMANCE_,They watched if God should stand the test. 
1379,_A ROMANCE_,"Ah, see,"" she cried, ""God is awake, "
1380,_A ROMANCE_,The dagger's bloodstains weep and make 
1381,_A ROMANCE_,"Large tears of red: the metal bleeds!"" "
1382,_A ROMANCE_,"If Lord God is awake and heeds, "
1383,_A ROMANCE_,"He must heed quickly."" So he said, "
1384,_A ROMANCE_,"For wading up the river-bed, "
1385,_A ROMANCE_,"Half-hid between its tree-topped banks, "
1386,_A ROMANCE_,He caught the gleam of horses' flanks 
1387,_A ROMANCE_,"And, mingled with the water's flow, "
1388,_A ROMANCE_,The low-breathed panting of the foe. 
1389,_A ROMANCE_,"Yea, God doth heed, and even now "
1390,_A ROMANCE_,His finger burns across each brow 
1391,_A ROMANCE_,His final lettering of doom: 
1392,_A ROMANCE_,Not one of these beyond Hell's gloom 
1393,_A ROMANCE_,"Shall thrive to win a Heavenly home."" "
1394,_A ROMANCE_,The words fell so remote and meek 
1395,_A ROMANCE_,"She seemed not her own self to speak, "
1396,_A ROMANCE_,But with her eyes to voice the spell 
1397,_A ROMANCE_,Which should bring true the oracle. 
1398,_A ROMANCE_,"He caught her hand. ""Come quick,"" "
1399,_A ROMANCE_,"cried, "
1400,_A ROMANCE_,"Come back, dear heart! See where they ride "
1401,_A ROMANCE_,With sword in hand across the grass 
1402,_A ROMANCE_,"To thwart us, so we may not pass "
1403,_A ROMANCE_,"Within the tower-gate."" "
1404,_A ROMANCE_,"""Too late,"" "
1405,_A ROMANCE_,"She said: ""We may not win the gate. "
1406,_A ROMANCE_,"Yet now, true friend, though I must burn "
1407,_A ROMANCE_,"At Rimini, time is to learn "
1408,_A ROMANCE_,One little lesson more of love: 
1409,_A ROMANCE_,"What would you?"" "
1410,_A ROMANCE_,"""That I die your knight."" "
1411,_A ROMANCE_,"Eh, truly?"" So she held above "
1412,_A ROMANCE_,"And touched him with his jagged sword, "
1413,_A ROMANCE_,And whispered low the crowning word 
1414,_A ROMANCE_,Which flooded all his face with light. 
1415,_A ROMANCE_,"He said, ""I shall not fear to die."" "
1416,_A ROMANCE_,"She raised him, smiling wondrously, "
1417,_A ROMANCE_,"Nor I to ride to Rimini, "
1418,_A ROMANCE_,"When you have died my knight."" "
1419,_A ROMANCE_,Twelve lancers circled into sight. 
1420,_A ROMANCE_,Count Ugo gallopped through the green 
1421,_A ROMANCE_,And laughed at that which he had seen. 
1422,_A ROMANCE_,"And yet one lover more?"" scoffed he, "
1423,_A ROMANCE_,"God's death, you use them royally; "
1424,_A ROMANCE_,"Maids grow less bold in Rimini."" "
1425,_A ROMANCE_,"My only lover and my last,"" "
1426,_A ROMANCE_,"She said. He scowled and caught her fast, "
1427,_A ROMANCE_,"Twisting his steel-glove in her hair, "
1428,_A ROMANCE_,"Jerked back her head, her eyes on him, "
1429,_A ROMANCE_,So that her throat and breasts shone bare 
1430,_A ROMANCE_,Above her corset's jewelled rim. 
1431,_A ROMANCE_,"Too good for fuel,"" he hissed, ""too fair; "
1432,_A ROMANCE_,"Yet those pale cheeks, this yellow hair, "
1433,_A ROMANCE_,Were not too good to deal out death. 
1434,_A ROMANCE_,"Eh? Hark to what the vixen saith, "
1435,_A ROMANCE_,"'She did not sin, nor meant to kill.' "
1436,_A ROMANCE_,"My son lies dead, say what you will; "
1437,_A ROMANCE_,"Lies dead because of you, you witch, "
1438,_A ROMANCE_,While leprous things in our town's ditch 
1439,_A ROMANCE_,"Crawl, mate, and spawn beneath God's sky; "
1440,_A ROMANCE_,Therefore. . . 
1441,_A ROMANCE_,He raised his hand on high 
1442,_A ROMANCE_,As he would smite her upturned face. 
1443,_A ROMANCE_,A sword leapt flashing down through space 
1444,_A ROMANCE_,And lopt the coward at the joint. 
1445,_A ROMANCE_,Corrado on his blade's red point 
1446,_A ROMANCE_,"Pricked up the hand, ""Tis thus we use "
1447,_A ROMANCE_,"Our dastard knights, whose hands abuse "
1448,_A ROMANCE_,"Our womenfolk in Reggio."" "
1449,_A ROMANCE_,The thunder rumbled long and low. 
1450,_A ROMANCE_,"Oh hark,"" she cried, ""God is awake; "
1451,_A ROMANCE_,"He walks communing for our sake."" "
1452,_A ROMANCE_,"Yea, He hath sent me here to take "
1453,_A ROMANCE_,"Your wilful body to the fire, "
1454,_A ROMANCE_,Till all is marred that men desire. 
1455,_A ROMANCE_,"Slay me that boy,"" Count Ugo said. "
1456,_A ROMANCE_,"One, who stood near, smote off his head. "
1457,_A ROMANCE_,"She hid her eyes so as not to see, "
1458,_A ROMANCE_,"Shuddered, swung round convulsively, "
1459,_A ROMANCE_,Stooped as a broken lily dips 
1460,_A ROMANCE_,To kiss the water--kissed his lips; 
1461,_A ROMANCE_,Then dumbly rode to Rimini. 
1462,_A ROMANCE_,And every pace the march along 
1463,_A ROMANCE_,"The hunters sang their hunting song, "
1464,_A ROMANCE_,"_"" Bianca of the yellow hair, "
1465,_A ROMANCE_,"With witch-face white as ivory, "
1466,_A ROMANCE_,Thy tender body back we bear 
1467,_A ROMANCE_,"To die the death in Rimini.""_ "
1468,_A ROMANCE_,Within the lands of rising night 
1469,_A ROMANCE_,"And fields of departing day, "
1470,_A ROMANCE_,"What hours we wandered, you and I, "
1471,_A ROMANCE_,How fain were we to stay! 
1472,_A ROMANCE_,Star-flowers were in your maiden hands-- 
1473,_A ROMANCE_,The stars were white with May. 
1474,_A ROMANCE_,Between moon-set and morning sun 
1475,_A ROMANCE_,"Where mist of the Dreamland lies, "
1476,_A ROMANCE_,"What glory there was yours and mine, "
1477,_A ROMANCE_,What love was in our eyes! 
1478,_A ROMANCE_,"For Sleep and Love walk hand-in-hand, "
1479,_A ROMANCE_,And Sleep with morning flies. 
1480,_A ROMANCE_,"Our star-lit land was wholly ours, "
1481,_A ROMANCE_,No warning of beast or bird 
1482,_A ROMANCE_,"Perturbed the twilight of our peace, "
1483,_A ROMANCE_,No watchers' tread was heard; 
1484,_A ROMANCE_,"We dwelt alone and loved alone, "
1485,_A ROMANCE_,Naught save our lips was stirred. 
1486,_A ROMANCE_,Would that this holiest mystery 
1487,_A ROMANCE_,Might come again to me! 
1488,_A ROMANCE_,"The radiance of thy moon-lit face, "
1489,_A ROMANCE_,The eyes of purity-- 
1490,_A ROMANCE_,"The wide gray eyes, the beckoning lips, "
1491,_A ROMANCE_,The silent cloudland sea. 
1492,DAYBREAK,DAYBREAK 
1493,DAYBREAK,"In frenzied haste, by legioned shadows pressed, "
1494,DAYBREAK,The Chariot of Charity in flight 
1495,DAYBREAK,"Glittered along the Parapet of Night, "
1496,DAYBREAK,With wheels of gold fast whirling to the West. 
1497,DAYBREAK,"Bridging with flame the barricaded Deep, "
1498,DAYBREAK,"It strove with sparking hoof and spangled heat, "
1499,DAYBREAK,"Where those twin rivers, Death and Life, retreat, "
1500,DAYBREAK,And surge across the Agony of Sleep. 
1501,DAYBREAK,"I, to my casement, stark with horror crept; "
1502,DAYBREAK,"Day tottered tall, and breathed a shuddering "
1503,DAYBREAK,breath: 
1504,DAYBREAK,"Wading, knee-deep, the turgid fords of Death, "
1505,DAYBREAK,He clomb the cloven cliff of Dawn--and leapt. 
1506,DAYBREAK,A hand of ivory caught up the rein; 
1507,DAYBREAK,The Chariot rolled back superb again. 
1508,HOME,HOME 
1509,HOME,"We shall not always dwell as now we dwell, "
1510,HOME,Together 'neath one home-protecting roof. 
1511,HOME,"For some of us our lives may not go well: 'Gainst such small perils courage will be proof, 'Gainst stronger ills these memories may be proof; "
1512,HOME,To some of us this life may say farewell-- 
1513,HOME,We cannot always dwell as now we dwell. 
1514,HOME,What though we dwell not then as now we dwell? 
1515,HOME,"Hearts can recover hearts, when hearts are fain; "
1516,HOME,While love stays with us everything is well; 
1517,HOME,"The roof of love is proof against the rain, "
1518,HOME,Dead hands will guard our hearts against the rain-- 
1519,HOME,Love will abide when all have said farewell:

1521,VANISHED LOVE,VANISHED LOVE 
1522,VANISHED LOVE,When my love was nigh me 
1523,VANISHED LOVE,Naught had I to say: 
1524,VANISHED LOVE,Then I feigned a false love-- 
1525,VANISHED LOVE,And turned my lips away. 
1526,VANISHED LOVE,"When my love lay dying, "
1527,VANISHED LOVE,"Sorrowing I said, "
1528,VANISHED LOVE,"'Soon shall I wear scarlet, "
1529,VANISHED LOVE,Because my love is dead.' 
1530,VANISHED LOVE,"When my love had vanished, "
1531,VANISHED LOVE,Then was nothing said: 
1532,VANISHED LOVE,I forgot the scarlet 
1533,VANISHED LOVE,For tears--and bowed my head.

1535,THALATTA! THALATTA!,"Not with a cry, nor with the stifled sound "
1536,THALATTA! THALATTA!,Of one who 'neath Death's billows of Despair 
1537,THALATTA! THALATTA!,"Thrusts up blue lips toward the outer air, "
1538,THALATTA! THALATTA!,Searching if any breathing may be found;

1541,THALATTA! THALATTA!,Through which he may push up his haggard face

1849,IN BEDLAM,Beheld the East as no unchartered dread 
1850,IN BEDLAM,"Threat'ning the world with universal fire, "
1851,IN BEDLAM,But as Thy kindness held aloft for men;

1854,IN BEDLAM,"Father, before the Darkness falls again, "
1855,IN BEDLAM,"Before my soul wends backward to the Night, "

1860,IN BEDLAM,"Christ, "
1861,IN BEDLAM,"He whose strong pity hath dethroned Thy might, "
1862,IN BEDLAM,And made a man a worthier god than Thou:

1864,IN BEDLAM,"Did love, and love, and love till his heart brake; "
1865,IN BEDLAM,He took away the anguish of men's pain 
1866,IN BEDLAM,By spending all their pain on his own life; 
1867,IN BEDLAM,He drove away the shadows from men's minds 
1868,IN BEDLAM,"By giving them himself, who was the Light. "
1869,IN BEDLAM,"Ah Christ, that thou hadst not been crucified! "
1870,IN BEDLAM,"Wert thou still living by the fishers' lake, "
1871,IN BEDLAM,Then thou hadst heard me half across the world; 
1872,IN BEDLAM,"Though from the Andes, I had cried to thee, "
1873,IN BEDLAM,"Still hadst thou heard, and come from Palestine "
1874,IN BEDLAM,"Only to stretch thy cooling hands on me, "
1875,IN BEDLAM,Only to rest thy cooling hands in mine--

1915,A SONG OF IGNOBLE EASE,"Tenderly led to where the stars do shine, "
1916,A SONG OF IGNOBLE EASE,"Speaking kind words, He placed His hands in mine. "
1917,A SONG OF IGNOBLE EASE,There did I see the trees go riding by

2230,MAN'S BEGINNING,"Supreme and unadored, content to be "
2231,MAN'S BEGINNING,"The only vessel on His starry sea, "
2232,MAN'S BEGINNING,He had no wish for sight of other eyes. 
2233,MAN'S BEGINNING,"But, as the years flew by, He older grew, "
2234,MAN'S BEGINNING,"And held less dear the loneliness He found, "
2235,MAN'S BEGINNING,When from some long-since reign He caught the 
2236,MAN'S BEGINNING,sound 
2237,MAN'S BEGINNING,"Of play-mate deities, whom once He knew. "
2238,MAN'S BEGINNING,Half-heedlessly He stooped toward a star 
2239,MAN'S BEGINNING,"And kissed its silver lips, when forth there came "
2240,MAN'S BEGINNING,"A little god, in speech like to those same "
2241,MAN'S BEGINNING,Dear children whom in sleep He heard afar. 
2242,MAN'S BEGINNING,"The Father God pulsated through His heart, "
2243,MAN'S BEGINNING,"He cried, ""O Child, my little son thou art."" "
2244,LOVE AT LAST,LOVE AT LAST 
2245,LOVE AT LAST,When I have looked upon Thy face 
2246,LOVE AT LAST,I hear a wandering discontent 
2247,LOVE AT LAST,"Wail through my living, and retrace "
2248,LOVE AT LAST,The leaf-strewn paths my feet frequent. 
2249,LOVE AT LAST,Folly abode within a glade 
2250,LOVE AT LAST,"And saw my flight and, laughing, bade "
2251,LOVE AT LAST,"Me greet her lips and kiss her hair, "
2252,LOVE AT LAST,Till I was fain to kiss her there. 
2253,LOVE AT LAST,"But Thou art sad and dost not speak, "
2254,LOVE AT LAST,So sad and sorrowful art Thou; 
2255,LOVE AT LAST,"Thine eyes are scarred, my eyes they seek, "
2256,LOVE AT LAST,And cruel marks have marred Thy brow. 
2257,LOVE AT LAST,"Pleasure laid hands on me and mine, "
2258,LOVE AT LAST,"She crowned my head with tangled vine, "
2259,LOVE AT LAST,Her arms about my neck lay bare; 
2260,LOVE AT LAST,I was constrained to kiss her there. 
2261,LOVE AT LAST,"Yea, Thou hast suffered. This I tell "
2262,LOVE AT LAST,By those long wound-prints in Thy hands; 
2263,LOVE AT LAST,"Mankind has never used Thee well, "
2264,LOVE AT LAST,"And loves not Thee, nor Thy commands. "
2265,LOVE AT LAST,Bitterness found me desolate 
2266,LOVE AT LAST,And kissed me with the breath of hate; 
2267,LOVE AT LAST,"Since Folly fled, she bade me wear "
2268,LOVE AT LAST,Her angry scarlet in my hair. 
2269,LOVE AT LAST,"Now, as I look into Thy face, "
2270,LOVE AT LAST,"Despised and battered though it be, "
2271,LOVE AT LAST,"Visage of scorn in every place, "
2272,LOVE AT LAST,I know that I belong to Thee. 
2273,LOVE AT LAST,Worthless these lips to give the kiss-- 
2274,LOVE AT LAST,"And yet I dare, recalling this, "
2275,LOVE AT LAST,When Life's last lovers left me bare 
2276,LOVE AT LAST,Thy patient face was constant there. 
2277,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT 
2278,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,When earnest-eyed we conversed through the 
2279,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,"night, "
2280,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,"Recalled past pleasure, followed up the hour "
2281,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,With plaintive music--sad memorial flower 
2282,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,Of melancholy and of old delight-- 
2283,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,Rode bold as Taillefer with tossing brand 
2284,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,"Across the hills of fancy, chanting strains "
2285,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,"Of ancient chivalry, while loud refrains "
2286,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,"Rumbled responsive through our faery band, "
2287,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,"Then Courage kindled Courage, making gay "
2288,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,"Carnage and conflict, poverty and fear; "
2289,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,"The path to glory golden did appear, "
2290,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,And I was brave to wend it any day. 
2291,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,"A far-blown cry of love and minstrelsy, "
2292,THE MIRROR OF THOUGHT,Revealed to me myself as I would be. 
2293,I'M SORRY,I'M SORRY 
2294,I'M SORRY,"I'm sorry, dear-- "
2295,I'M SORRY,But I did not know 
2296,I'M SORRY,"That behind your eyes, "
2297,I'M SORRY,Where the joy-fields grow 
2298,I'M SORRY,"And dance to the joy of dancing skies, "
2299,I'M SORRY,There were forests where graver flowers rise; 
2300,I'M SORRY,"Weighted with shadow, "
2301,I'M SORRY,They stand tiptoe: 
2302,I'M SORRY,"So I'm sorry, dear-- "
2303,I'M SORRY,I did not know. 
2304,I'M SORRY,"I'm sorry, dear. "
2305,I'M SORRY,As we older grow 
2306,I'M SORRY,"There will come a day, "
2307,I'M SORRY,"May its feet move slow, "
2308,I'M SORRY,"When we, where the life-fields fade to gray "
2309,I'M SORRY,"And the skies dance not, shall have naught to say, "
2310,I'M SORRY,"Met by a Shadow, "
2311,I'M SORRY,"In voices low, "
2312,I'M SORRY,"But, ""I'm sorry, God-- "
2313,I'M SORRY,"I did not know."" "
2314,DREAMLAND LOVE,DREAMLAND LOVE 
2315,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Here in the Far Land of our own begetting, "
2316,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Crouched on the haunted cliff begirt by sea, "
2317,DREAMLAND LOVE,Hushed in the murmurous swell of dim waves 
2318,DREAMLAND LOVE,fretting 
2319,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Walls and sheer rocks which cradle you and me, "
2320,DREAMLAND LOVE,How shall we lisp of older worlds and cities? 
2321,DREAMLAND LOVE,How shall we sigh for newer worlds to be? 
2322,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Naught here is left of moanings or of pities, "
2323,DREAMLAND LOVE,Only the whispered silence of the sea. 
2324,DREAMLAND LOVE,"We had no stars to shine our curved prows hither, "
2325,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Nor had we moons to guide us fearlessly, "
2326,DREAMLAND LOVE,Only the age-long yearnings of the river 
2327,DREAMLAND LOVE,Bruised by steep banks and aching for the sea; 
2328,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Rivers whose tides grow tired of earthly lilies, "
2329,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Too full of splendour to last so long as we, "
2330,DREAMLAND LOVE,Rivers whose length-long craving and strong will is 
2331,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Once to see space, and then to cease to be. "
2332,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Hither we journeyed sunset-ways by water, "
2333,DREAMLAND LOVE,"I in my phantom keel of Poesy, "
2334,DREAMLAND LOVE,"You in Sleep's arms, of whom you are the daughter, "
2335,DREAMLAND LOVE,Till in my arms Sleep laid you noiselessly. 
2336,DREAMLAND LOVE,Down through the dusk our dreamland barque 
2337,DREAMLAND LOVE,"drove gleaming, "
2338,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Under gray sails, through gradual groves of sea, "
2339,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Till from your eyes I saw the love-light streaming, "
2340,DREAMLAND LOVE,And gave the kiss which set your spirit free. 
2341,DREAMLAND LOVE,All the fair glories of our first beginnings 
2342,DREAMLAND LOVE,We did forsake to gain this quiet place; 
2343,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Passions we left, and fears, and youthful sinnings; "
2344,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Virtues we left, and early signs of grace. "
2345,DREAMLAND LOVE,Dreamings we brought and beauty of the May- 
2346,DREAMLAND LOVE,"time, "
2347,DREAMLAND LOVE,All else we flung to where Time's whirlwinds race. 
2348,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Timeless are we in this our godlike play-time, "
2349,DREAMLAND LOVE,Since Sleep has led us gently face to face. 
2350,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Gray glide the mists around our ocean's edges, "
2351,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Gray grope the tides across the gray-paved sea, "
2352,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Gray clings the foam about our granite ledges, "
2353,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Naught, naught remains to safeguard you from "
2354,DREAMLAND LOVE,me. 
2355,DREAMLAND LOVE,"These axe the souls who watch us at our dreaming, "
2356,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Spirits of mist, of spray-dashed crag and sea; "
2357,DREAMLAND LOVE,"All, all is hushed, save your gray eyes deep gleaming, "
2358,DREAMLAND LOVE,Eyes of veiled flame in caves of mystery. 
2359,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Like frozen stars, we watched each other's shining, "
2360,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Wondered with pain if any time might be, "
2361,DREAMLAND LOVE,"When we should lean beyond our own divining, "
2362,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Touching the lips of others such as we, "
2363,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Till I grew faint within my lonely heaven, "
2364,DREAMLAND LOVE,Sank through the cloudland stretched twixt you 
2365,DREAMLAND LOVE,"and me, "
2366,DREAMLAND LOVE,Plunged through the thunder where firmaments 
2367,DREAMLAND LOVE,"rocked riven, "
2368,DREAMLAND LOVE,So gave the kiss which set your spirit free. 
2369,DREAMLAND LOVE,"We must go hence, when flames the tyrant morning, "
2370,DREAMLAND LOVE,We shall go hence at breaking of new day; 
2371,DREAMLAND LOVE,"We, like the stars strange midnight lands adorning, "
2372,DREAMLAND LOVE,"We must go hence, steal separately away. "
2373,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Yet, like the stars, perchance we may glide burning "
2374,DREAMLAND LOVE,When round the earth the skies are growing gray; 
2375,DREAMLAND LOVE,"We to our haunted cliff may sail returning, "
2376,DREAMLAND LOVE,Nearing the crags where yesternight we lay. 
2377,DREAMLAND LOVE,Thus from the Far Land of our own begetting 
2378,DREAMLAND LOVE,"I must depart across Sleep's sundering sea, "
2379,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Throughout the Sim Land wander inly fretting, "
2380,DREAMLAND LOVE,Till night drifts back restoring you to me; 
2381,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Till through the dark I see Love's pennons streaming, "
2382,DREAMLAND LOVE,When you will kiss and set my spirit free; 
2383,DREAMLAND LOVE,Till through the dusk our dreamland barque drives 
2384,DREAMLAND LOVE,"gleaming, "
2385,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Under gray sails, through gradual groves of sea. "
