100,MABEL.,"instruments, globes, &c.; a singular blending of science"
101,MABEL.,"with art, indicating a delicate and speculative organization"

104,MABEL.,
105,MABEL.,"ORAN, MAURICE, _and_ ROGER."
106,MABEL.,
107,ORAN.,ORAN.
108,ORAN.,
109,ORAN.,"Well, well! and so ye deem I love her not,"
110,ORAN.,Ye and the world that love so passing well?--
111,ORAN.,"That still I trifle with her bright young life,"
112,ORAN.,"As the wind plays with some frail water-bell,"
113,ORAN.,"Wafting it wantonly about the sky,"
114,ORAN.,Till at some harsher breath it breaks and dies?
115,ORAN.,
116,MAURICE.,MAURICE.
117,MAURICE.,
118,MAURICE.,"Nay, not thus far would our reflections go."
119,MAURICE.,Friendship paints not with the foul brush of Conscience!
120,MAURICE.,"But thou, a man of dark and mystic aims,"
121,MAURICE.,"Tracking out Science through forbidden ways,"
122,MAURICE.,Leaving the light and trodden paths to grope
123,MAURICE.,"'Mid fearful speculations and wild dreams,"
124,MAURICE.,May'st hunt thy Will-o'-the-wisp until thou lead'st
125,MAURICE.,"Our sister, all unwitting, to her death."
126,MAURICE.,
127,ROGER.,ROGER.
128,ROGER.,
129,ROGER.,That shalt thou answer unto us. Thy life
130,ROGER.,"Shall be to her life like the sun and shade,"
131,ROGER.,Lost in one setting.
132,ROGER.,
133,ORAN.,ORAN.
134,ORAN.,
135,ORAN.,Ay! thou sayest well--
136,ORAN.,Thou sayest well. How oft a random shaft
137,ORAN.,Striketh King Truth betwixt the armour-joints!--
138,ORAN.,"One life, one sun, one setting for us both."
139,ORAN.,
140,ORAN.,"Which way, then, tend your fears? What certain aim"
141,ORAN.,Have all these strokes you level at my ways?
142,ORAN.,
143,ROGER.,ROGER.
144,ROGER.,
145,ROGER.,"We say that you, against all light received,"
146,ROGER.,"Against all laws of prudence and of love,"
147,ROGER.,Practise dark magic on our sister's soul--
148,ROGER.,"That by strange motions, incantations, spells,"
149,ROGER.,"So work you on her spirit that strange sleep,"
150,ROGER.,"Sombre as Death's dark shadow, presently"
151,ROGER.,"Steals o'er her fragile body, dulls her sense,"
152,ROGER.,And wraps her wholly in its chill embrace;
153,ROGER.,"That thus, spell-bound, lost to the living world,"
154,ROGER.,"She lies till thou again unwind her chain,"
155,ROGER.,And wak'st her feebly to this life of earth.
156,ROGER.,"Thus dost thou peril her, thou blinded man!"
157,ROGER.,"Sett'st her dear life against thy moonstruck thought,"
158,ROGER.,And slay'st thy dove on Folly's altar-steps.
159,ROGER.,
160,MAURICE.,MAURICE.
161,MAURICE.,
162,MAURICE.,"Ay! if you loved her, would your eyes have miss'd"
163,MAURICE.,"The moonish faintness that o'erlaps her now,"
164,MAURICE.,"Melting the fresh, full, ruddy glow of health"
165,MAURICE.,"To loveliness most heavenly, yet most sad?"
166,MAURICE.,"Her cheeks, where youth once summer'd into roses,"
167,MAURICE.,"Glow now with faint exotic loveliness,"
168,MAURICE.,Not native to this harsh and gusty earth;
169,MAURICE.,And from her large dark eyes there seems to gaze
170,MAURICE.,"Some angel with mute, melancholy looks,"
171,MAURICE.,As from a casement at this jarring world.
172,MAURICE.,
173,ORAN.,ORAN.
174,ORAN.,
175,ORAN.,"Ha! then you too have seen it; it is not,"
176,ORAN.,"O Heaven!--is not delusion, this fond dream,"
177,ORAN.,"But even now it works, works bliss for her."
178,ORAN.,"Proceed, Sir ... you were saying ... Sir, I list ..."
179,ORAN.,"That in her eyes you saw angelic fire,"
180,ORAN.,"Pure from the dross, the dimming clouds of earth,"
181,ORAN.,"Deem'd now her frame ethereal, unakin"
182,ORAN.,"To earth's clay-moulded fabrics--such, perchance,"
183,ORAN.,"As entering heaven, might have left its dust"
184,ORAN.,"At the bright folding portals, sandal-like,"
185,ORAN.,"And thence, repassing in seraphic trance,"
186,ORAN.,Still left unclaim'd the vesture at the gate!
187,ORAN.,
188,ROGER.,ROGER.
189,ROGER.,
190,ROGER.,You glory in her weakness! 'Tis too much--
191,ROGER.,"Rash man, beware, a bitter end will come."
192,ROGER.,
193,MAURICE.,MAURICE.
194,MAURICE.,
195,MAURICE.,I fain would think that study hath o'erwrought
196,MAURICE.,"Your heated brain to this short fever fit,"
197,MAURICE.,That soon may pass and leave your vision clear.
198,MAURICE.,"In truth, I note strange changes in your mien--"
199,MAURICE.,"A wandering glance, quick, restless eagerness,"
200,MAURICE.,"Rapt snatches of deep thought, wherein the mind"
201,MAURICE.,Seems cleaving heaven with wild extatic wings:
202,MAURICE.,"Your cheeks are pale, and all your nervous frame"
203,MAURICE.,Thrills 'neath some strange enthusiastic touch.
204,MAURICE.,"Lay by your books awhile, and breathe again,"
205,MAURICE.,"As in those days gone by, the country air,"
206,MAURICE.,"The sweet, calm country air, where perfume floats"
207,MAURICE.,Like love that finds no heart so godlike large
208,MAURICE.,"Can clasp it wholly in its one embrace,"
209,MAURICE.,But overflows creation with its bliss.
210,MAURICE.,"Thus shall you quickly exorcise this madness,"
211,MAURICE.,And cleanse your brain of these pernicious dreams.
212,MAURICE.,
213,ORAN.,ORAN.
214,ORAN.,
215,ORAN.,"This madness! I bethink me of the past,"
216,ORAN.,Of all the great and noble who have toil'd
217,ORAN.,"Amid the deep dark mines of burning thought,"
218,ORAN.,Wearing out life to quarry forth the Truth;
219,ORAN.,"Of all the seers and watchers, early and late"
220,ORAN.,Waiting with eager blood-hot eyes the light
221,ORAN.,"Rising afar in some untrodden East,"
222,ORAN.,"Full of divine and precious influence,"
223,ORAN.,"Calling, like Mezzuin from his minaret,"
224,ORAN.,The thankless world to worship and be glad;
225,ORAN.,Of all the patient thinkers of the earth
226,ORAN.,"Who talk'd with Wisdom like familiar friends,"
227,ORAN.,"Until their voices unaccustom'd grew,"
228,ORAN.,And men stared blankly at them as they pass'd:
229,ORAN.,"I do bethink me of them all, and know"
230,ORAN.,"How each walk'd through his labyrinth of scorn,"
231,ORAN.,And was accounted mad before all men.
232,ORAN.,But patience!--Winter bears within its breast
233,ORAN.,The nascent seeds of golden harvest-time.
234,ORAN.,
235,ORAN.,This only shall I tell you of my ways--
236,ORAN.,"Straying, now here, now there, 'mid science' wealth,"
237,ORAN.,I have discover'd a vast hidden power--
238,ORAN.,A power that perfected shall surely work
239,ORAN.,"Great revolution in all human laws,--"
240,ORAN.,Where stop its courses I as yet know not;
241,ORAN.,"'Tis to me like the sun, that all the day"
242,ORAN.,"Shines godlike in my vision, and, at night,"
243,ORAN.,"Though darkness hide its brightness, still, I feel,"
244,ORAN.,Shines on in glory over other spheres;
245,ORAN.,"It is a power beneficent and good,"
246,ORAN.,That grants to spirit infinite control
247,ORAN.,"Over all matter, and that frees the soul"
248,ORAN.,"From its flesh shackles, and its sensuous means."
249,ORAN.,"What else its influences, or for health,"
250,ORAN.,"For happiness, or blessing, I say not--"
251,ORAN.,Save that such glimpses of vast powers unknown
252,ORAN.,"Dawn on my wondering mind, that like a man"
253,ORAN.,"Standing upon some giddy pinnacle,"
254,ORAN.,"With a whole world seen faint and small below,"
255,ORAN.,I close mine eyes for very fear and joy.
256,ORAN.,"To her, my Mabel, do I bear in love"
257,ORAN.,"Some first-fruits of my finding--make her rich,"
258,ORAN.,"That, gazing through her eyes, I may behold"
259,ORAN.,"How sweet is heaven, how dear is happiness."
260,ORAN.,This is the sum of that I work on her;
261,ORAN.,"Then, though I thank you for your good intent,"
262,ORAN.,"Leave me untroubled to my life of thought,"
263,ORAN.,Leave her all trustful in the arms of love.
264,ORAN.,
265,ROGER.,ROGER.
266,ROGER.,
267,ROGER.,"You love her not, false man! your heart and soul"
268,ROGER.,"Are steep'd in science till not e'en the heel,"
269,ROGER.,"Achilles-like, is vulnerable left."
270,ROGER.,"Ay! wear thus feeling's semblance as you will,"
271,ROGER.,"Pale visionary! no more shall I pause,"
272,ROGER.,But with strong hand arrest your mad career!
273,ROGER.,"Soon we return arm'd with a father's power,"
274,ROGER.,To snatch our sister from your fearful arts.
275,ROGER.,
276,MAURICE.,MAURICE.
277,MAURICE.,
278,MAURICE.,"Oh! if you love her, Sir, as once you did--"
279,MAURICE.,If yet upon the dial of your life
280,MAURICE.,"Her sun mark out the short sweet hours of joy,"
281,MAURICE.,And all too swiftly on the shadows glide--
282,MAURICE.,"If yet you prize the loving heart you hold,"
283,MAURICE.,"From this most mad delusion waken up,"
284,MAURICE.,That blindly blights her whom it seeks to bless;
285,MAURICE.,"Cease your Utopian and unsafe essays,"
286,MAURICE.,And rather turn your studious care to call
287,MAURICE.,"The fading roses back into her cheeks,"
288,MAURICE.,And shed health's gladness on her feeble frame;
289,MAURICE.,"Reflect whilst yet you may, lest late Remorse"
290,MAURICE.,"Stalk, ghost-like, through the chambers of your soul,"
291,MAURICE.,Haunting their gloomy void for evermore.
292,MAURICE.,
293,MAURICE.,[_Exeunt Maurice and Roger_.

299,MAURICE.,
300,ORAN.,ORAN.
301,ORAN.,
302,ORAN.,
303,ORAN.,ORAN.
304,ORAN.,
305,ORAN.,Not love her! O my God! thou knowest me--
306,ORAN.,"Thou, looking through me as the sun at noon"
307,ORAN.,That searches through the being of the world--
308,ORAN.,"Thou setting life against thy glory light,"
309,ORAN.,"As men hold up a crystal 'gainst the sun,"
310,ORAN.,Making its frame as nothing in the blaze!
311,ORAN.,
312,ORAN.,"Lo! my heart was like a chaotic world,"
313,ORAN.,"Still, silent, 'mid the dreary waste of time."
314,ORAN.,"Man there was not in all its desert bounds,"
315,ORAN.,"But hoary ruins of past wondrous things,"
316,ORAN.,"Old unbeliefs, fierce doubts, unsightly dreams,"
317,ORAN.,"That wearing out their wild hot-breathing life,"
318,ORAN.,Wearily stretch'd their writhing shapes to die;
319,ORAN.,"Then came she moving o'er my awe-hush'd soul,"
320,ORAN.,"Like God's own Spirit over earth's void waters,"
321,ORAN.,And there arose order and life through all.
322,ORAN.,"She was my sun, set high to rule the day,"
323,ORAN.,And make my world all bright and beautiful;
324,ORAN.,"She was my moon, amid the stilly night"
325,ORAN.,"Subduing darkness with her quiet smiles,"
326,ORAN.,"And stealing softly through my anxious dreams,"
327,ORAN.,A sweet-soul'd hostage for departed day;
328,ORAN.,"She was my summer, clothing all my life"
329,ORAN.,With fragrant blossoms of delight and joy.
330,ORAN.,
331,ORAN.,[_A pause_.
332,ORAN.,
333,ORAN.,Not love her! 'Tis as yesterday the time
334,ORAN.,"When first my love stole fainting to her ear,"
335,ORAN.,In deep scarce-worded murmurs of desire.
336,ORAN.,"'Twas evening, and above the weary land"
337,ORAN.,Silence lay dreaming in a golden hush;
338,ORAN.,"The summer's sunset yellow'd in the wheat,"
339,ORAN.,"And the ripe year, with harvest promise full,"
340,ORAN.,"Slept on the wavy slopes and verdant leas,"
341,ORAN.,Like one who through long hours of toil at last
342,ORAN.,"Sees the glad work accomplish'd, and in peace"
343,ORAN.,Flings him along the meadows to repose;
344,ORAN.,"Below, the bells of even faintly chimed,"
345,ORAN.,And sent their hymnal music up the breeze
346,ORAN.,"To where I stood, half-praying, by her side."
347,ORAN.,"Then all my words and thoughts that came and went,"
348,ORAN.,"Waving about the secret of my love,"
349,ORAN.,"Like billows plashing on a silent shore,"
350,ORAN.,"All at one gush flow'd from me o'er her heart,"
351,ORAN.,And broke the banks of silence; then my love
352,ORAN.,"Sank through her liquid eyes to read her soul,"
353,ORAN.,Like diver that through waving water-floods
354,ORAN.,"Seeketh the priceless pearl that lies below,"
355,ORAN.,And there found life--found joy for evermore:
356,ORAN.,"It is as yesterday that time to me,--"
357,ORAN.,"Sweet time, when love entwines the locks of life"
358,ORAN.,"With fragrant blossoms, like a one-hour's bride,"
359,ORAN.,"And claspeth summer with soft pleading arms,"
360,ORAN.,"That she, though ne'er so eager to be gone,"
361,ORAN.,"Still tarries smiling for a last embrace,"
362,ORAN.,And drops her hoarded flowers upon the way:
363,ORAN.,It is as yesterday--my love the same--
364,ORAN.,"The love that led me through all heavy tasks,"
365,ORAN.,"All lonely watchings by the midnight lamp,"
366,ORAN.,To win the fame that still might shine on her;
367,ORAN.,"And e'en--how dear the thought!--this wondrous power,"
368,ORAN.,"This godlike influence which has dawn'd on me,"
369,ORAN.,Thus from my love takes colouring and aim!
370,ORAN.,"Not love her! Well, well, I'll forget the word--"
371,ORAN.,"The sun shines on, though blind eyes see it not."
372,ORAN.,
373,ORAN.,[_A pause_.
374,ORAN.,
375,ORAN.,"It cannot be--this aim so deeply--weigh'd,"
376,ORAN.,"So long and calmly sifted, cannot fail."
377,ORAN.,O wondrous power! great mystery of life!
378,ORAN.,Reserved for me of all the sons of men;
379,ORAN.,Fruit ripening high upon the wall of heaven
380,ORAN.,"For me to pluck with eager, trembling hands,"
381,ORAN.,And press its vintage out for thirsting worlds
382,ORAN.,More blessed still that into her sweet cup
383,ORAN.,First may I pour the clearest of the wine--
384,ORAN.,"For her--for her--ah, yes! for her supreme,"
385,ORAN.,"I struggle onward through this blinding light,"
386,ORAN.,"E'en at whose dazzling threshold I might stand,"
387,ORAN.,"Pale, trembling, like a terror-smitten soul,"
388,ORAN.,Waiting bewilder'd at the gate of heaven.
389,ORAN.,"Yet once again let me the plan review,"
390,ORAN.,"Searching within my soul of souls each part,"
391,ORAN.,"That doubt or danger, lurking there, may thus"
392,ORAN.,By love's keen-scented instincts hunted be.--
393,ORAN.,
394,ORAN.,[_A long pause_.
395,ORAN.,
396,ORAN.,"Yes! it is so--this deep magnetic sleep,"
397,ORAN.,"That from my being passes upon her,"
398,ORAN.,"Bindeth the body close in deepest thrall,"
399,ORAN.,But setteth free the soul. What real need
400,ORAN.,"Hath spirit of these sensuous avenues,"
401,ORAN.,Through which the soul looks feebly on the world?
402,ORAN.,"This power then opes the prison door awhile,"
403,ORAN.,And sends the spirit chainless o'er the earth.
404,ORAN.,"This know I--without eyes the spirit sees,"
405,ORAN.,"Gains instant cognizance of hidden things,"
406,ORAN.,And counts all space for nothing; knowledge comes
407,ORAN.,"Upon it with the falling of the flesh,"
408,ORAN.,So that there is no thing in earth or heaven
409,ORAN.,But to the unhoused spirit native is--
410,ORAN.,The mantle falls and leaves the Prophet angel!
411,ORAN.,"Body, then, is the prison-house of soul,"
412,ORAN.,"And freedom is its highest happiness,"
413,ORAN.,"Its heaven, its primal being full of joy."
414,ORAN.,"This power that holdeth thus the keys of life,"
415,ORAN.,"Can then at will give moments of release,"
416,ORAN.,Which to the soul are as the water-brooks
417,ORAN.,That scantly rise amid a sun-scorch'd waste:
418,ORAN.,"These, oft repeated, must at length destroy"
419,ORAN.,"The thraldom of the flesh, and give at will"
420,ORAN.,A freer issue to the practised soul--
421,ORAN.,"At lowest gladden it with gleams of bliss,"
422,ORAN.,Glimpses of heaven amid this exile time.
423,ORAN.,"Yes! thus, my Mabel, shall thy prison'd soul"
424,ORAN.,Rise to its sister angels heavenward still;
425,ORAN.,"And soon the mortal fetters shall hang loose,"
426,ORAN.,Scarce clogging aught its motions glad and free.
427,ORAN.,Thus shall thy young fair frame no longer be
428,ORAN.,"A prison, but a meetest dwelling-place,"
429,ORAN.,"Full of all infinite delights, and dear"
430,ORAN.,"As is its nest to the heaven-soaring lark,"
431,ORAN.,"That yearns down, singing, to it from the sky."
432,ORAN.,"These men, did they not see it in thine eyes,"
433,ORAN.,"Amazed and fearful at the dazzling sight,"
434,ORAN.,As some rude passer gazing up aloft
435,ORAN.,"Sees from some casement, unawares, a face"
436,ORAN.,That makes his great rough heart on sudden rock
437,ORAN.,With wonder and with worship--in her frame
438,ORAN.,"Did they not see the mortal waxing faint,"
439,ORAN.,The immortal fusing it with heavenly fire?
440,ORAN.,"Ay! the charm works, and thou, my life, my love,"
441,ORAN.,"Reapest the first-fruits of my long, long toil."
442,ORAN.,
443,ORAN.,
444,ORAN.,
445,ORAN.,"SCENE III.--_A Boudoir. Flowers about it, in beautifully"
446,ORAN.,shaped Vases. A Greenhouse at one end. The
447,ORAN.,"window-panes delicately tinted, and hung with light"
448,ORAN.,"fleecy draperies_. MABEL _working, and singing in a"
449,ORAN.,low voice_.
450,ORAN.,
451,ORAN.,
452,ORAN.,MABEL (_singing_).
453,ORAN.,
454,ORAN.,"At night when stars shine bright and clear,"
455,ORAN.,"The soft winds on the casements blow,"
456,ORAN.,"And round the chamber rustle low,"
457,ORAN.,"Like one unseen, whose voice we hear,"
458,ORAN.,On tiptoe stealing to and fro--
459,ORAN.,
460,ORAN.,"At night when clouds are dark and drear,"
461,ORAN.,"They moan about the lattice sore,"
462,ORAN.,"And murmur sighs for evermore,"
463,ORAN.,"That fill us with a chilly fear,"
464,ORAN.,Oft glancing at the well-barr'd door--
465,ORAN.,
466,ORAN.,"At night, in moonlight or in gloom,"
467,ORAN.,"They wander round the drooping thatch,"
468,ORAN.,Like some poor exile thence to catch
469,ORAN.,"Fond glimpses of each well-loved room,"
470,ORAN.,And sigh beside the unraised latch--
471,ORAN.,
472,ORAN.,"O unseen Wind! art thou alone,"
473,ORAN.,Thus breathing round the sleeping land?
474,ORAN.,"Or roams with thee a spirit band,"
475,ORAN.,"Blending sad voices with thine own,--"
476,ORAN.,Voices that once with cheerful tone
477,ORAN.,Made music round the sleeping land?
478,ORAN.,
479,ORAN.,"ORAN (_from the Greenhouse, unperceived_)."
480,ORAN.,
481,ORAN.,"Ah! her dear voice. How all my nature thrills,"
482,ORAN.,"My heart, my brain, beneath the mellow sound,"
483,ORAN.,Like some great dome with holy music fill'd!
484,ORAN.,"She is the lark, above my listening soul"
485,ORAN.,Hovering still with carols from Heaven's gate.
486,ORAN.,"She is the perfumed breeze, that evermore"
487,ORAN.,Sweeps music from the Aeolian strings of life.
488,ORAN.,"She is the sea, that fills with sweetest sound"
489,ORAN.,The yearning earth that folds it in its arms.
490,ORAN.,"Not love her--Ah! dear heart, how utterly!"
491,ORAN.,
492,ORAN.,[_A pause_.
493,ORAN.,
494,ORAN.,"What if amid these spirit wanderings,"
495,ORAN.,"This so mysterious power can grant at will,--"
496,ORAN.,"What if the angels, smitten with her grace,"
497,ORAN.,Woo'd her away for ever from my heart?
498,ORAN.,"The dove came twice again unto the ark,"
499,ORAN.,"With messages of peace, and hope, and joy,"
500,ORAN.,But the third time return'd not. She's my dove--
501,ORAN.,"Oh! wing'd she ever from my longing heart,"
502,ORAN.,"The waters of my life would quick subside,"
503,ORAN.,And leave me stranded on the shoals of Time.
504,ORAN.,"What if God saw her hovering aloft,"
505,ORAN.,And smiled her in amongst his cherubim?
506,ORAN.,"What if the draught of bliss should, Lethe-like,"
507,ORAN.,"Blot me for ever from her memory,"
508,ORAN.,"So that she sought me never, never more?"
509,ORAN.,Oblivion! take again this fearful power--
510,ORAN.,"No more shall Fate be tempted with my wealth,"

513,ORAN.,[_A pause_.

518,ORAN.,"And let it beat its life out on the bars,"
519,ORAN.,Lest some dear bliss detain it in the heavens?
520,ORAN.,"Shall I spill rashly forth this wine of joy,"
521,ORAN.,Because for me within the crystal cup
522,ORAN.,Some dregs may haply rest when she has drunk?
523,ORAN.,"Ah, no! for her alone shall I take thought."
524,ORAN.,The first pure sacrifice of Love is self!
525,ORAN.,There is no peril. God that sends the power
526,ORAN.,Will send the guardian angel to direct.
527,ORAN.,I work for her--Heaven speed the work of love.

576,MABEL.,That keeps the fountain of my being full--
577,MABEL.,Thou art the heart that beats with measured pulse
578,MABEL.,The joyous moments of my flowing life--

2142,THE MOTHER.,To yield their cattle ever cool relief
2143,THE MOTHER.,"From the fierce scorching of the burning sun,"
2144,THE MOTHER.,And slake their hot thirst when the toil is done.

2146,THE MOTHER.,"It chanced that war, which still doth enter in"
2147,THE MOTHER.,"Where men are most or fewest, small or great,"
2148,THE MOTHER.,"Here of a sudden raised its hellish din,"
2149,THE MOTHER.,"And woke to fury, lust, and bloody hate;"
2150,THE MOTHER.,"So that with battles, forays, murders, thefts,"
2151,THE MOTHER.,Rang oft the echoes of the mountain clefts.
2152,THE MOTHER.,
2153,THE MOTHER.,There was one tribe that in unconscious ease
2154,THE MOTHER.,"Slumber'd and thought of danger but in dreams,"
2155,THE MOTHER.,"Heard not the tramp of men upon the breeze,"
2156,THE MOTHER.,"While the stars, watching with faint trembling beams,"
2157,THE MOTHER.,"Saw noiseless spectres round the village creep,"
2158,THE MOTHER.,Like apparitions of unquiet sleep.
2159,THE MOTHER.,
2160,THE MOTHER.,"Then, silence-murder'd, what a yell arose!"
2161,THE MOTHER.,"And the scared sleepers, rushing forth in fear,"
2162,THE MOTHER.,"Met death without the portals from dim foes,"
2163,THE MOTHER.,"Or e'er the warrior could grasp his spear,"
2164,THE MOTHER.,"Or fit the arrow to his unstrung bow,"
2165,THE MOTHER.,Or ward the fatal stroke that laid him low.
2166,THE MOTHER.,
2167,THE MOTHER.,"So, with the plunder, and a captured band"
2168,THE MOTHER.,"Of hapless women, ere the morning light"
2169,THE MOTHER.,"Flitted the victors swiftly through the land,"
2170,THE MOTHER.,"Red with the trophies of their deadly fight,"
2171,THE MOTHER.,Leaving the lion and his hungry crew
2172,THE MOTHER.,To clear the morning of this bloody dew.
2173,THE MOTHER.,
2174,THE MOTHER.,"To meet them joyous forth their women came,"
2175,THE MOTHER.,And led them back in triumph to the fold;
2176,THE MOTHER.,"Taunting their foes with many a bitter shame,"
2177,THE MOTHER.,Though now they lay in Death's aims stark and cold:
2178,THE MOTHER.,"Whilst the poor captives, rack'd with fear and woe,"
2179,THE MOTHER.,Cower'd close together from Fate's hapless blow.
2180,THE MOTHER.,
2181,THE MOTHER.,"Soon there came traders from the coast, and then"
2182,THE MOTHER.,"The weeping captives all were marshall'd out,"
2183,THE MOTHER.,"And barter'd singly with the heartless men,"
2184,THE MOTHER.,Each bosom trembling still with fear and doubt;
2185,THE MOTHER.,"But when the truth burst on them, a hoarse cry"
2186,THE MOTHER.,Of wild despair ascended to the sky.
2187,THE MOTHER.,
2188,THE MOTHER.,There was one there who from the Tree of Life
2189,THE MOTHER.,Pluck'd yet the blossoms with the fruit of years;
2190,THE MOTHER.,"Scarce yet a woman, though a meek-soul'd wife,"
2191,THE MOTHER.,"And with a babe to claim her prayers and tears,"
2192,THE MOTHER.,A tender bud of early summer time
2193,THE MOTHER.,Ere breezy woods are in their verdant prime.
2194,THE MOTHER.,
2195,THE MOTHER.,"Her 'mongst the rest they barter'd, and the child,"
2196,THE MOTHER.,"Too young to sever from its mother's breast,"
2197,THE MOTHER.,"Left they unnoticed, whilst she, poor one, wild"
2198,THE MOTHER.,"'Twixt hope and fear, still held it closely prest"
2199,THE MOTHER.,"Unto her heart, whose throbbings, loud and deep,"
2200,THE MOTHER.,Beat an alarum through the infant's sleep.
2201,THE MOTHER.,
2202,THE MOTHER.,"But soon her master, as he hasten'd off"
2203,THE MOTHER.,"With his new purchases, the infant caught,"
2204,THE MOTHER.,"And bid the mother, with a heartless scoff,"
2205,THE MOTHER.,"Fling it away: said he, ""'Tis good for nought;"
2206,THE MOTHER.,"None of this lumber can we have, the road"
2207,THE MOTHER.,"Is long enough to tread without a load."""
2208,THE MOTHER.,
2209,THE MOTHER.,"The mother clasp'd her babe with bitter cry,"
2210,THE MOTHER.,"But a rude hand enforced it from her arms,"
2211,THE MOTHER.,"And the rough steward held it up on high,"
2212,THE MOTHER.,Laughing aloud the while at her alarms;
2213,THE MOTHER.,"Said he unto his master; ""This shall be"
2214,THE MOTHER.,"A bait to draw her on with willingly."""
2215,THE MOTHER.,
2216,THE MOTHER.,"He bound around the infant's waist a line,"
2217,THE MOTHER.,"That fasten'd to his crupper, and then gave"
2218,THE MOTHER.,"The babe back to her, laughing,--""That end's thine--"
2219,THE MOTHER.,"The other stays with me;"" ""A witty slave!"""
2220,THE MOTHER.,"The master chuckled, and they moved away,"
2221,THE MOTHER.,She following with anguish and dismay.
2222,THE MOTHER.,
2223,THE MOTHER.,"They journey'd o'er the desert, 'neath a sky"
2224,THE MOTHER.,"Scorch'd by the fiery footsteps of the sun,"
2225,THE MOTHER.,Without a shade to bless the wistful eye;
2226,THE MOTHER.,"And soon her fellow slaves droop'd, one by one,"
2227,THE MOTHER.,"Callous to blows that harshly drove them on,"
2228,THE MOTHER.,"Strength, hope, and love of life all seeming gone."
2229,THE MOTHER.,
2230,THE MOTHER.,"But she went onward with no word or plaint,"
2231,THE MOTHER.,"Clasping the child unto her bosom still,"
2232,THE MOTHER.,"Unflagging when all else began to faint,"
2233,THE MOTHER.,Intent to save her little one from ill;
2234,THE MOTHER.,"And they look'd on her as she sped along,"
2235,THE MOTHER.,Wond'ring what made so frail a creature strong.
2236,THE MOTHER.,
2237,THE MOTHER.,"At eve she bent above her sleeping treasure,"
2238,THE MOTHER.,"With eyes that wept for pity and for love,"
2239,THE MOTHER.,"Filling its cup of life in richer measure,"
2240,THE MOTHER.,With the blest care that watches us above;
2241,THE MOTHER.,"And in the morn they bound the babe again,"
2242,THE MOTHER.,And so drew on the mother in their train.
2243,THE MOTHER.,
2244,THE MOTHER.,"Her tender feet soon wounded were, and sore"
2245,THE MOTHER.,"With the rough travel, and the weary way,"
2246,THE MOTHER.,"And her slight limbs, o'ertask'd and loaded, bore"
2247,THE MOTHER.,Less lightly up their burden day by day;
2248,THE MOTHER.,"But, nature failing, Love imparted power"
2249,THE MOTHER.,To bear her steps up to the resting hour.
2250,THE MOTHER.,
2251,THE MOTHER.,Alas! the mother gazed with aching eyes
2252,THE MOTHER.,"Upon the life-spring in her little child,"
2253,THE MOTHER.,As one laid by a fountain while it dries;
2254,THE MOTHER.,"Daily she watch'd it ebb, till she grew wild"
2255,THE MOTHER.,"With anguish at the Angel drawing near,"
2256,THE MOTHER.,And bared her own breast for his fatal spear.
2257,THE MOTHER.,
2258,THE MOTHER.,"She lost all sense of weariness and pain,"
2259,THE MOTHER.,"And with hot tearless eyes still hurried on,"
2260,THE MOTHER.,"Bearing the child girt by its cruel chain,"
2261,THE MOTHER.,"All thought save of her cherish'd burden gone,"
2262,THE MOTHER.,Fearful alone lest other eyes should guess
2263,THE MOTHER.,The feeble thing her longing arms did press.
2264,THE MOTHER.,
2265,THE MOTHER.,"At last they saw the babe was weaker growing,"
2266,THE MOTHER.,"That soon the little spark of life must fade,"
2267,THE MOTHER.,"So, spite of all her prayers, and wild tears flowing,"
2268,THE MOTHER.,"Beside a spring the sleeping child they laid,"
2269,THE MOTHER.,"And bid her onward, heedless of her woe"
2270,THE MOTHER.,"But on the earth she fell, and would not go."
2271,THE MOTHER.,
2272,THE MOTHER.,"They raised her up, and bound her on a steed,"
2273,THE MOTHER.,And so march'd onward on their weary way--
2274,THE MOTHER.,"For there was none to help her in her need,"
2275,THE MOTHER.,"And thus they travell'd eastward all the day,"
2276,THE MOTHER.,"But when they rested, and on each bow'd head"
2277,THE MOTHER.,"Sleep heavy lay, the mother rose and fled."
2278,THE MOTHER.,
2279,THE MOTHER.,"And speeding swiftly with a lapwing's flight,"
2280,THE MOTHER.,"Backward she hurried to the little spring,"
2281,THE MOTHER.,"Led by a power that knoweth not the night,"
2282,THE MOTHER.,But flies through darkness with unerring wing;
2283,THE MOTHER.,"And so e'er morning shimmer'd in the East,"
2284,THE MOTHER.,She clasp'd her dead babe to her panting breast.
2285,THE MOTHER.,
2286,THE MOTHER.,"At morn they miss'd her, and the women said,"
2287,THE MOTHER.,"""She seeks her babe beside the distant well,"
2288,THE MOTHER.,"There wilt thou find her, if she be not dead,"
2289,THE MOTHER.,"For O! the love of mother who can tell."""
2290,THE MOTHER.,"And so the steward gallop'd back in haste,"
2291,THE MOTHER.,To seek the lost one in the desert waste.
2292,THE MOTHER.,
2293,THE MOTHER.,"At last the spring rose in the distant sand,"
2294,THE MOTHER.,"With its close verdure pleasant to the eye,"
2295,THE MOTHER.,"And there, as, nearing it, the place he scann'd,"
2296,THE MOTHER.,"He saw the mother with her infant lie,"
2297,THE MOTHER.,"Quiet and stilly on each other's breast,"
2298,THE MOTHER.,Folded together in unbroken rest;
2299,THE MOTHER.,
2300,THE MOTHER.,"Her arms around it thrown, that e'en in sleep"
2301,THE MOTHER.,"Still press'd the infant to her stricken heart,"
2302,THE MOTHER.,"No rest so perfect, no repose so deep,"
2303,THE MOTHER.,From her sweet babe the mother's love to part.
2304,THE MOTHER.,Before him loud and bitter curses sped--

2559,MORGAN.,"Still set astride, and looking fondly up,"
2560,MORGAN.,"Said he, ""See! here's the only lord that sets"
2561,MORGAN.,"His foot upon my shoulder."" The man's heart"
2562,MORGAN.,"Scarce beats, I warrant, now the child is dead."
2563,MORGAN.,
2564,MONK.,MONK.

2569,MORGAN.,MORGAN.
2570,MORGAN.,
2571,MORGAN.,"Ah! there, good Father, lies the chiefest woe,"
2572,MORGAN.,For in the slaying of the hound his rage
2573,MORGAN.,"Quite spent its force, and now I fear me much"
2574,MORGAN.,His mind bath lost its olden empery.
2575,MORGAN.,
2576,MONK.,MONK.
2577,MONK.,
2578,MONK.,"Nay! Death smites passion still upon the mouth,"

2580,MONK.,
2581,MORGAN.,MORGAN.
2582,MORGAN.,
2583,MORGAN.,But in this one act all his fury pass'd;
2584,MORGAN.,"And turning softly from the dead child there,"
2585,MORGAN.,"Suffering none to touch it where it lay,"
2586,MORGAN.,"He sat him down in awful calmness nigh,"
2587,MORGAN.,And gazed forth blankly like a sculptured face;
2588,MORGAN.,"And when we fain would pass to take the child,"
2589,MORGAN.,"A strange wild voice still warns us back again,"
2590,MORGAN.,"""Hush! for the boy is sleeping."" It would seem"
2591,MORGAN.,"He will not think that Death hath struck the babe,"
2592,MORGAN.,"But blinds his willing soul, and deems it sleep."
2593,MORGAN.,
2594,MONK.,MONK.
2595,MONK.,
2596,MONK.,"A longer sleep, whose waking is not here!"
2597,MONK.,"Poor soul! that, catching at the skirts of Truth."

2601,MORGAN.,
2602,MORGAN.,"Good Father! go thou to him, for this doubt"

2605,MORGAN.,
2606,MONK.,MONK.
2607,MONK.,
2608,MONK.,It is mine office

2654,LLEWELLYN.,"Think you he would not sigh, ""Sleep, on! sleep on!"
2655,LLEWELLYN.,"Thou copy and thou counterfeit of me,"

2660,MONK.,
2661,MONK.,O my son! my son!

2666,LLEWELLYN.,
2667,LLEWELLYN.,"Why, Father, if Death woke him as he lay,"
2668,LLEWELLYN.,"The lad would look up at him with a smile,"
2669,LLEWELLYN.,"And twist his little limbs in childish sport,"
2670,LLEWELLYN.,"Until the angel, surfeited with fear,"
2671,LLEWELLYN.,Would love and spare the thing that fear'd him not.
2672,LLEWELLYN.,"No man could see his pretty ways and frown,--"
2673,LLEWELLYN.,"And he was full of little childish tricks,"
2674,LLEWELLYN.,That won the very heart out of a man
2675,LLEWELLYN.,"In spite of him. There's Beowolf the Curst,"
2676,LLEWELLYN.,"With ne'er a gentle word for man or child,"
2677,LLEWELLYN.,But cold and crusty as a northern hill--
2678,LLEWELLYN.,"Why this day sen'night did my master there,"
2679,LLEWELLYN.,"Crawl up his knees without a Yea or Nay,"
2680,LLEWELLYN.,"And toy'd him with his sword-hilt merrily,"
2681,LLEWELLYN.,"Till the rough man, caught with his gamesome arts,"
2682,LLEWELLYN.,Swore that he had the making of a man;
2683,LLEWELLYN.,"And, for the maids, there's none but has a word,"
2684,LLEWELLYN.,Or kiss to bandy with the gainsome lad;
2685,LLEWELLYN.,"Ay! when he wakes you'll see how he will crow,"
2686,LLEWELLYN.,"And fill the place with laughter--he's no girl,"

2711,LLEWELLYN.,"It was ill-done of me--a wicked stroke,"

2713,LLEWELLYN.,And now I mind me how he loved the dog;
2714,LLEWELLYN.,"How many an hour he sported in the sun,"
2715,LLEWELLYN.,Twining his grisly neck with summer buds;
2716,LLEWELLYN.,"And how the dog was patient with the boy,"
2717,LLEWELLYN.,Yielding him gently to his little arms--
2718,LLEWELLYN.,There was a lion's heart in the old hound!
2719,LLEWELLYN.,"The deed's accursed--accursed--the child will wake,"
2720,LLEWELLYN.,And call for Gelert with his merry voice;
2721,LLEWELLYN.,"And when the dog no more comes stalking nigh,"
2722,LLEWELLYN.,"With great mild head to meet the outstretch'd hands,"
2723,LLEWELLYN.,The child will sob his heart out for his friend;
2724,LLEWELLYN.,"For, Sir, his nature is right full of love,"
2725,LLEWELLYN.,"And generous affections, never slack"
2726,LLEWELLYN.,To let his soul have space and mastery--
2727,LLEWELLYN.,A wicked stroke!

2729,MONK.,MONK.
2730,MONK.,
2731,MONK.,Ah! would his voice could sound

2735,MONK.,"Then hear it now come floating down from heav'n,"
2736,MONK.,Calling your lone and bleeding heart to God.
2737,MONK.,
2738,LLEWELLYN.,LLEWELLYN.
2739,LLEWELLYN.,
2740,LLEWELLYN.,"His voice was very sweet, a silvery stream"
2741,LLEWELLYN.,"Of music, rippling softly through my life--"
2742,LLEWELLYN.,"And ne'er to hear his little prattling tongue,"
2743,LLEWELLYN.,"Stumbling upon the threshold steps of speech,"
2744,LLEWELLYN.,"Catching quaint sounds and fragments of discourse,"
2745,LLEWELLYN.,And setting them to childish uses straight--
2746,LLEWELLYN.,I've sat and heard him by the hour--you'd wonder
2747,LLEWELLYN.,"To hear his little saws and sentences,"
2748,LLEWELLYN.,And now to think I'll hear him never more--
2749,LLEWELLYN.,"Alack! alack!--but no, it is not true--"
2750,LLEWELLYN.,The child is sleeping--Ay! it must be so.
2751,LLEWELLYN.,"What know you, Father, of an infant's sleep?"
2752,LLEWELLYN.,"You, in your stony cell 'mid shaven friars,"
2753,LLEWELLYN.,"All crowding down the nether side of life,"
2754,LLEWELLYN.,"Hearing no sweeter voice than matin-bells,"
2755,LLEWELLYN.,"No speech, but grace in cold refectories;"
2756,LLEWELLYN.,Ay! thence it is--Oh fool! that I should doubt!
2757,LLEWELLYN.,'Tis so--'tis so--I knew that I should pluck

2772,LLEWELLYN.,"The sky look ruddy, as with all the blood"
2773,LLEWELLYN.,"Of battle-fields, where no man cried for grace."
2774,LLEWELLYN.,"Blood? look, Sir; look again--I--something clouds"

2785,MONK.,
2786,MONK.,
2787,MONK.,There is a little dove that sits
2788,MONK.,"Between the arches all alone,"
2789,MONK.,"Cut and carved in old grey stone,"
2790,MONK.,And a spider o'er it flits:
2791,MONK.,
2792,MONK.,"Round and round his web is spun,"
2793,MONK.,"With the still bird looking through,"
2794,MONK.,"From among the beads of dew,"
2795,MONK.,Set in glories of the sun.
2796,MONK.,
2797,MONK.,So the bird looks out at morn
2798,MONK.,"At the larks that mount the sky,"
2799,MONK.,"And it gazes, still and shy,"
2800,MONK.,At the new moon's scanty horn.
2801,MONK.,
2802,MONK.,"And the owls, that fly by night,"
2803,MONK.,"Mock it from the ivied tower,"
2804,MONK.,Hooting at the midnight hour
2805,MONK.,Down upon it from the height.
2806,MONK.,
2807,MONK.,"But the little dove sits on,"
2808,MONK.,"Calm between the arches there,"
2809,MONK.,"In the holy morning air,"
2810,MONK.,When the owls with night are gone.
2811,MONK.,
2812,MONK.,"Then the bells for matins ring,"
2813,MONK.,"And the grey friars past it go,"
2814,MONK.,"Into church in double row,"
2815,MONK.,And it hears the chaunts they sing.
2816,MONK.,
2817,MONK.,And the incense stealing out
2818,MONK.,"Through the chinks, and through the seams,"
2819,MONK.,"Floats among the dusty beams,"
2820,MONK.,And wreathes all the bird about.
2821,MONK.,
2822,MONK.,All the children as they pass
2823,MONK.,"Turn to see the bird of stone,"
2824,MONK.,"'Twixt the arches all alone,"
2825,MONK.,Wading to it through the grass.
2826,MONK.,
2827,MONK.,"Is the spider's pretty net,"
2828,MONK.,"Hung across the arches there,"
2829,MONK.,But a frail and foolish snare
2830,MONK.,For the little stone bird set?
2831,MONK.,
2832,MONK.,"If the place should e'er decay,"
2833,MONK.,"And the tower be crumbled down,"
2834,MONK.,"And the arches overthrown,"
2835,MONK.,Would the dove then fly away?
2836,MONK.,
2837,MONK.,"So that, seeking it around,"
2838,MONK.,"All some golden summer day,"
2839,MONK.,"'Mid the ruins as they lay,"
2840,MONK.,It should never more be found?

2871,LLEWELLYN.,
2872,LLEWELLYN.,"Oh! Father, mock me not--I know that Death"
2873,LLEWELLYN.,Sits lightly on him as a dreamless sleep;
2874,LLEWELLYN.,So dear a bud can never lose its sweets;
2875,LLEWELLYN.,Oh! foolish heart! I thought to see him grow
2876,LLEWELLYN.,"In strength and beauty, like a sapling oak,"
2877,LLEWELLYN.,"Spreading his stalwart shoots about the sky,"
2878,LLEWELLYN.,"Till, when old age set burdens on my back,"
2879,LLEWELLYN.,In every bough my trembling hands should find
2880,LLEWELLYN.,A staff to prop me onward to the grave;

2892,LLEWELLYN.,"And, loathing, turns from the delusive cup;"
2893,LLEWELLYN.,"Nay! touch him not--'tis well that he should lie,"
2894,LLEWELLYN.,"Calm and unquestion'd, on the breast of Heav'n;"
2895,LLEWELLYN.,"Yet once again my lips must flutter his,"
2896,LLEWELLYN.,"He may not be so distant, but that Love"

2898,LLEWELLYN.,The lips are warm--my God! he lives! he lives!

3916,AN EPISODE.,
3917,AN EPISODE.,
3918,AN EPISODE.,"Autumn went faintly flying o'er the land,"
3919,AN EPISODE.,"Trailing her golden hair along the West,"
3920,AN EPISODE.,"Weeping to find her waving fields despoil'd,"
3921,AN EPISODE.,Her yellow leaves all floating on the wind:
3922,AN EPISODE.,And Winter grim came stalking from the North.
3923,AN EPISODE.,"Around the coast rough blasts began to blow,"
3924,AN EPISODE.,"And toss the seas about in giant sport,"
3925,AN EPISODE.,"Lurking without to catch unwary sails,"
3926,AN EPISODE.,And snap their bellying seams against the mast.
3927,AN EPISODE.,"So Guy lay idly waiting in the port,"
3928,AN EPISODE.,"Gazing out eastward through the stormy mist,"
3929,AN EPISODE.,"Gazing out eastward morn and closing eve,"
3930,AN EPISODE.,Seeking some break amid the hurtling clouds.
3931,AN EPISODE.,"But many days the same wind strongly blew,"
3932,AN EPISODE.,"Keeping his bark close moor'd within the bay,"
3933,AN EPISODE.,"Jerking the cable, like a restive steed."
3934,AN EPISODE.,"And waiting thus impatient to be gone,"
3935,AN EPISODE.,"Looking out seaward from the dripping wharf,"
3936,AN EPISODE.,"Strange rumours fill'd his ears, from inland come,"
3937,AN EPISODE.,How all the land around his native place
3938,AN EPISODE.,"Was devastated by a mighty Beast,"
3939,AN EPISODE.,"Most terrible to see, and passing strong."
3940,AN EPISODE.,"They told him how it slew both man and brute,"
3941,AN EPISODE.,"Destroying every living thing around,"
3942,AN EPISODE.,And laying waste the land for many a mile;
3943,AN EPISODE.,"And how 'twas thought no blade, by mortal wrought,"
3944,AN EPISODE.,Could cleave its way into the monster's heart;
3945,AN EPISODE.,And then they told him how his lord the King
3946,AN EPISODE.,"Had late proclaim'd through all the country round,"
3947,AN EPISODE.,"That whosoe'er should slay the noisome Beast,"
3948,AN EPISODE.,"Should straight be knighted by his kingly sword,"
3949,AN EPISODE.,And honour'd greatly in the rescued land.
3950,AN EPISODE.,
3951,AN EPISODE.,"Yet none was found so stout of heart and limb,"
3952,AN EPISODE.,To venture in this perilous emprize;
3953,AN EPISODE.,"""But ah!"" they said, supposing him far off,"
3954,AN EPISODE.,"""If famous Guy were here, there were a man"
3955,AN EPISODE.,Would rid us of this monster presently.
3956,AN EPISODE.,"But as for him, he speeds away through France,"
3957,AN EPISODE.,"Bearing to other lands his strength, that, faith,"
3958,AN EPISODE.,"Were better spent at home amongst his kin."""
3959,AN EPISODE.,
3960,AN EPISODE.,And still the East wind bluster'd to the shore.
3961,AN EPISODE.,
3962,AN EPISODE.,"Now Guy, whose ears still tingled all the day"
3963,AN EPISODE.,"With these strange murmurs of the troubled land,"
3964,AN EPISODE.,Began to feel his heart with pity move;
3965,AN EPISODE.,"And, for his soul still fretted at delay,"
3966,AN EPISODE.,"Like a leash'd hound that scents the flying game,"
3967,AN EPISODE.,"He straight resolved to take this quarrel up,"
3968,AN EPISODE.,And for his country's weal to slay the Beast.
3969,AN EPISODE.,
3970,AN EPISODE.,"So he arose, girt on his trusty sword,"
3971,AN EPISODE.,"And with his bow and quiver slung behind,"
3972,AN EPISODE.,"And at his belt his mighty battle-axe,"
3973,AN EPISODE.,Rode calmly forth to slay the hurtful Beast.
3974,AN EPISODE.,"And no man knew that he was Guy, for all"
3975,AN EPISODE.,Believed him far away on foreign shores;
3976,AN EPISODE.,"Which pleased him passing well, ""Because,"" he said,"
3977,AN EPISODE.,"""I do this thing for Phoelice and the King,"
3978,AN EPISODE.,And none shall know but Heaven that sees the deed.
3979,AN EPISODE.,"But when the country feels returning joy,"
3980,AN EPISODE.,"Her heart will flutter with a secret thought."""
3981,AN EPISODE.,
3982,AN EPISODE.,And all the land was desolate and waste;
3983,AN EPISODE.,"The fields stood rotting 'neath the Autumn rains,"
3984,AN EPISODE.,"And no man pluckt the sodden corn that lay,"
3985,AN EPISODE.,"Dead ripe, along the furrows 'mid the weeds;"
3986,AN EPISODE.,"No cattle browsed upon the long rank grass,"
3987,AN EPISODE.,Or paused to gaze upon him as he rode;
3988,AN EPISODE.,"The cottages, deserted all in haste,"
3989,AN EPISODE.,"Stood open-door'd and rifted by the winds,"
3990,AN EPISODE.,With cold grey ashes scatter'd o'er the hearth.
3991,AN EPISODE.,"Here he beheld the homely meal spread forth,"
3992,AN EPISODE.,"Which no man ate; and there, upon the floor,"
3993,AN EPISODE.,"An o'erturn'd cradle, whence a mother late"
3994,AN EPISODE.,"Had snatch'd her babe up with a cry, and fled."
3995,AN EPISODE.,
3996,AN EPISODE.,"And all his heart was sore with what he saw,"
3997,AN EPISODE.,"For he met none to wish him once ""God speed;"""
3998,AN EPISODE.,So he spurr'd onward swifter to the place
3999,AN EPISODE.,Where lurk'd the monster that thus spoil'd the land;
4000,AN EPISODE.,And long the road seem'd to him in his wrath.
4001,AN EPISODE.,"At last he came unto the fearful spot,"
4002,AN EPISODE.,Mark'd with the blanching bones of man and beast;
4003,AN EPISODE.,"A thicket planted by a lonely heath,"
4004,AN EPISODE.,"O'ergrown with brambles and unwholesome weeds,"
4005,AN EPISODE.,"That clasping trees around with witch-like arms,"
4006,AN EPISODE.,"Poison'd their life out, and still held them dead."
4007,AN EPISODE.,"And at one side there stretch'd a stagnant pool,"
4008,AN EPISODE.,"Unstirr'd by any grateful breeze, but thick"
4009,AN EPISODE.,"With slimy leaves, and rushes all forlorn,"
4010,AN EPISODE.,And every footstep on the spongy bank
4011,AN EPISODE.,Fill'd straightway with the oozing of decay.
4012,AN EPISODE.,The Beast hid in the bosom of this wood;
4013,AN EPISODE.,And as Guy went he saw two eyes of fire
4014,AN EPISODE.,"Burn through the darkness of the wood, like blasts"
4015,AN EPISODE.,Sent from a smith's forge suddenly at night.
4016,AN EPISODE.,"But, nought dismay'd, he bent his bow of steel,"
4017,AN EPISODE.,And sent an arrow whirring through the leaves.
4018,AN EPISODE.,"He heard the shaft ring on the monster's ribs,"
4019,AN EPISODE.,"And backward leap, as when a falchion strikes"
4020,AN EPISODE.,Full on a warrior's casque with fiery force;
4021,AN EPISODE.,"Whereat with roaring horrible to hear,"
4022,AN EPISODE.,"Like storm-winds belching through a cavern's mouth,"
4023,AN EPISODE.,"Forth rush'd the monster, furious and grim,"
4024,AN EPISODE.,With open jaws and reeking breath at Guy;
4025,AN EPISODE.,"Who, leaping nimbly back, put forth his strength,"
4026,AN EPISODE.,And struck her full between the eyes a blow
4027,AN EPISODE.,That made the stout axe quiver in his hand.
4028,AN EPISODE.,"But, nothing hurt, the madden'd Beast rush'd on,"
4029,AN EPISODE.,"And nigh o'erwhelm'd him in her headlong course,"
4030,AN EPISODE.,"Denting his breastplate, wrought of temper'd steel,"
4031,AN EPISODE.,With the close home-thrust of her pointed horns.
4032,AN EPISODE.,"But Guy, swift wheeling round his snorting steed,"
4033,AN EPISODE.,"Thought on his Phoelice, and, with mighty strength,"
4034,AN EPISODE.,Launch'd forth a stroke that made the thick blood flow
4035,AN EPISODE.,In loathsome torrents from a gaping wound.
4036,AN EPISODE.,"So, cheer'd at heart, he thunder'd blow on blow,"
4037,AN EPISODE.,"Till, with a bellow of despair and pain,"
4038,AN EPISODE.,"The monster tore the earth, and, writhing, died."
4039,AN EPISODE.,
4040,AN EPISODE.,"And when Guy saw that he had slain the Beast,"
4041,AN EPISODE.,"He was right glad, and full of sweet content."
4042,AN EPISODE.,"And so he wiped his blood-stain'd battle-axe,"
4043,AN EPISODE.,And rode with lighten'd heart in haste away
4044,AN EPISODE.,To bear the welcome tidings to the town.
4045,AN EPISODE.,"And as he pass'd, or that he dreamt, or saw,"
4046,AN EPISODE.,"It seem'd as though the land bloom'd up again,"
4047,AN EPISODE.,And sunshine fill'd the air with hope and life.
4048,AN EPISODE.,And so he bore the tidings to the town--
4049,AN EPISODE.,"And when the people heard the Beast was dead,"
4050,AN EPISODE.,"They gather'd round with tears and cries of joy,"
4051,AN EPISODE.,And scarce found words to thank and honour him.
4052,AN EPISODE.,"And one brought forth her babe, and held him up,"
4053,AN EPISODE.,"And cried, ""Look, child upon him, that your soul"
4054,AN EPISODE.,"May know the fashion of a noble man!"""
4055,AN EPISODE.,
4056,AN EPISODE.,But still he told no man that he was Guy.
4057,AN EPISODE.,
4058,AN EPISODE.,"And all desired to lead him to the King,"
4059,AN EPISODE.,"But he would not, and turn'd another way--"
4060,AN EPISODE.,"""Nay! friends,"" said he, ""I need no recompense."
4061,AN EPISODE.,For in the doing of a worthy deed
4062,AN EPISODE.,"Lies all the honour that a man should seek."""
4063,AN EPISODE.,"And thus he turn'd away unto the sea,"
4064,AN EPISODE.,"And would not tarry, or for prayers, or tears;"
4065,AN EPISODE.,"And when he came unto the quiet port,"
4066,AN EPISODE.,"He said no word unto his waiting men,"
4067,AN EPISODE.,"But gazed out seaward; and the waves were down,"
4068,AN EPISODE.,"The clouds fast breaking, and the West wind blew;"
4069,AN EPISODE.,"And many a sail sped swiftly o'er the main,"
4070,AN EPISODE.,White in the sunshine as a sea-gull's wing--
4071,AN EPISODE.,"And so he went on ship-board cheerily,"
4072,AN EPISODE.,"And they hove anchor with a right good-will,"
4073,AN EPISODE.,"And spreading canvas to the welcome breeze,"
4074,AN EPISODE.,Bore swiftly out into the open sea;
4075,AN EPISODE.,"And Guy stood silent in the dipping bows,"
4076,AN EPISODE.,Gazing out seaward with a strange still smile.

4352,ORPHEUS.,Calling her name unto lone mountain tops;
4353,ORPHEUS.,Sending it flying on the clouds to heaven.
4354,ORPHEUS.,I drop my tears amid the dews at morn;

4395,ORPHEUS.,Laid thee beneath the rankly waving grass;
4396,ORPHEUS.,Opening Earth's portals wide to let thee wend
4397,ORPHEUS.,Forth to Plutonian realms of gloom away;

4419,ORPHEUS.,"Melting the cruel Cerberus himself,"
4420,ORPHEUS.,"The Parcae, and snake-lock'd Eumenides,"
4421,ORPHEUS.,To pity of my measureless despair.
4422,ORPHEUS.,"I sang thy beauty, O Eurydice!"
4423,ORPHEUS.,"I sigh'd my love forth, O Eurydice!"
4424,ORPHEUS.,"With tears and weary sighs, Eurydice!"
4425,ORPHEUS.,And at thy name the pains of Hell grew light;
4426,ORPHEUS.,"Ixion's wheel stopp'd in its weary rounds,"

4428,ORPHEUS.,And draughts of comfort flow'd o'er Tantalus:--

4431,ORPHEUS.,"He promised thee again if I would go,"

4437,ORPHEUS.,"And I perchance no more to gaze on thee,"
4438,ORPHEUS.,Snared by some fatal falsehood from thy side?
4439,ORPHEUS.,Yet strove I hard; until at length I came
4440,ORPHEUS.,"Where Lethe flow'd before me, faint and dim;"
4441,ORPHEUS.,"Ye gods! how could I cross it from my love,"
4442,ORPHEUS.,That might wash out her memory for aye;
4443,ORPHEUS.,That I should live and dream of her no more;
4444,ORPHEUS.,That I should live and love her never more;
4445,ORPHEUS.,"That I should sing no more, Eurydice;"

4447,ORPHEUS.,Nor bear her forth e'en on the wings of thought.
4448,ORPHEUS.,"And so I turn'd to gaze, Eurydice!"
4449,ORPHEUS.,"I turn'd to clasp thee, O Eurydice!--"
4450,ORPHEUS.,And lo! thy form straightway dissolved away;
4451,ORPHEUS.,Thy beauty in the light dissolved away;
4452,ORPHEUS.,And Hades and all things dissolved away;
4453,ORPHEUS.,"Until I found me on thy cold, cold grave,"
4454,ORPHEUS.,"Amid the grass that I would grew o'er me,"
4455,ORPHEUS.,"Clasping us close within one narrow home,"
4456,ORPHEUS.,Where I no more might wake and find thee gone.--
4457,ORPHEUS.,The earth oped not unto my frantic cries;
4458,ORPHEUS.,The portals closed thee from me evermore--
4459,ORPHEUS.,"Else had I melted Hell itself with prayers,"
4460,ORPHEUS.,And borne thee back to Earth triumphantly.
4461,ORPHEUS.,
4462,ORPHEUS.,"I cried, heart-stricken, on Proserpina;"
4463,ORPHEUS.,I rent the rocks around with endless prayers;
4464,ORPHEUS.,"I told her all the story of our love,"
4465,ORPHEUS.,I launch'd my sorrows on her woman's heart;
4466,ORPHEUS.,"I sought her through the barren winter-time,"
4467,ORPHEUS.,The woful winter-time for Earth and me;
4468,ORPHEUS.,"And, ""Oh!"" I thought, ""her soul will soon relent,"
4469,ORPHEUS.,"And rush in crystal torrents from her eyes,"
4470,ORPHEUS.,"Till in the joy of sympathetic tears,"
4471,ORPHEUS.,"She woo my love from Pluto's stony heart."""
4472,ORPHEUS.,"I waited, and I question'd long the Spring;"
4473,ORPHEUS.,"I question'd every flower and budding spray,"
4474,ORPHEUS.,If thou didst come among them back again;
4475,ORPHEUS.,"I conjured each bright blossom, each green leaf,"
4476,ORPHEUS.,"That, leaving Earth, she bears full-arm'd to Dis,"
4477,ORPHEUS.,"But backward flingeth ere her glad return,"
4478,ORPHEUS.,"That every step of glorious liberty,"
4479,ORPHEUS.,Fall upon flowers throughout the happy land;
4480,ORPHEUS.,"But never came response, Eurydice,--"
4481,ORPHEUS.,"The flowers were dumb, O lost Eurydice!"
4482,ORPHEUS.,"They would not see thee spring from Earth like them,"
4483,ORPHEUS.,"Outshining all their fainter loveliness,"
4484,ORPHEUS.,And so they left me to my lorn despair;
4485,ORPHEUS.,"She left me lorn, O false Proserpina!"
4486,ORPHEUS.,"And never more may I behold thee here,"
4487,ORPHEUS.,"In Spring or Summer, O Eurydice!"
4488,ORPHEUS.,"By day or night, O lost Eurydice!"
4489,ORPHEUS.,
4490,ORPHEUS.,"They shall not keep me from thee, O beloved!"
4491,ORPHEUS.,"Dis shall not keep me from thee, O beloved;"
4492,ORPHEUS.,"But I shall shake his gates in my despair,"
4493,ORPHEUS.,Until they open wide to let me pass;
4494,ORPHEUS.,"I'll take my life up like a mighty rock,"
4495,ORPHEUS.,And so beat breaches in the walls of Time;
4496,ORPHEUS.,"I'll cast existence from me like a wrestler's robes,"
4497,ORPHEUS.,"And with my supple, naked soul throw Fate;"
4498,ORPHEUS.,I'll snap the shackles whose Promethean links
4499,ORPHEUS.,Bind down my soul unto this narrow earth.--
4500,ORPHEUS.,"Dost hear my voice dim floating to thee now,"
4501,ORPHEUS.,Along the waves that ripple at my feet?
4502,ORPHEUS.,"Thus do I come to thee, Eurydice,"
4503,ORPHEUS.,"Through waving water-floods, Eurydice,"

4542,THE SCULPTOR.,
4543,THE SCULPTOR.,He sought it in the bosom of the hills;
4544,THE SCULPTOR.,"He sought it in the silence of the woods,"
4545,THE SCULPTOR.,Their sunny nooks and shady solitudes;
4546,THE SCULPTOR.,He sought it in the fountains and the rills.
4547,THE SCULPTOR.,

4551,THE SCULPTOR.,But still the thought hid dimly from his eyes;
4552,THE SCULPTOR.,
4553,THE SCULPTOR.,"Its voice came to him on the evening breeze,"
4554,THE SCULPTOR.,That flutter'd faintly through his summer dreams--
4555,THE SCULPTOR.,He heard it through the flowing of the streams;
4556,THE SCULPTOR.,He heard it softly rustling through the trees.
4557,THE SCULPTOR.,
4558,THE SCULPTOR.,"Yet still the thought that murmur'd through his heart,"
4559,THE SCULPTOR.,He found not anywhere about the land;
4560,THE SCULPTOR.,"Ne'er saw its spirit shape before him stand,"
4561,THE SCULPTOR.,Though from all nature it seem'd prone to start.
4562,THE SCULPTOR.,
4563,THE SCULPTOR.,"And thus he wander'd homeward, dreaming still"
4564,THE SCULPTOR.,"Of all the beauty that had haunted him,"
4565,THE SCULPTOR.,"With mystic meanings shadowy and dim,"
4566,THE SCULPTOR.,"By woodland, and by meadow, vale and hill:"
4567,THE SCULPTOR.,
4568,THE SCULPTOR.,"He wander'd homeward, and in musing mood"
4569,THE SCULPTOR.,"Stay'd his slow steps beside a marble block,"
4570,THE SCULPTOR.,"Hewn from some far unstain'd Italian rock,"
4571,THE SCULPTOR.,That for his shaping chisel waiting stood.
4572,THE SCULPTOR.,
4573,THE SCULPTOR.,"Then his heart spoke out to him, ""Not alone"
4574,THE SCULPTOR.,"This thought divine hides in the streams and woods,"
4575,THE SCULPTOR.,"Seeking expression through their solitudes,"
4576,THE SCULPTOR.,Perchance e'en lies it in this unhewn stone.
4577,THE SCULPTOR.,
4578,THE SCULPTOR.,"It may be that the soul which fills all space,"
4579,THE SCULPTOR.,"And speaks up to us from each thing we see,"
4580,THE SCULPTOR.,"In words that are for ever mystery,"
4581,THE SCULPTOR.,"Within this Parian, too, hath resting-place."""
4582,THE SCULPTOR.,
4583,THE SCULPTOR.,"He gazed on, dreaming through the dim twilight,"
4584,THE SCULPTOR.,And to his inner sight the marble grew
4585,THE SCULPTOR.,"Clear and translucent, so that, gazing through,"
4586,THE SCULPTOR.,"A mystic shape form'd to his wondering sight,"
4587,THE SCULPTOR.,
4588,THE SCULPTOR.,"That seem'd imprison'd in the Parian cell,"
4589,THE SCULPTOR.,Seeking in vain release and utterance;
4590,THE SCULPTOR.,"For evermore, with upward beaming glance,"
4591,THE SCULPTOR.,Framing the words its lips could never tell.
4592,THE SCULPTOR.,
4593,THE SCULPTOR.,"The vision pass'd; but still with unseen power,"
4594,THE SCULPTOR.,It stirr'd within his heart by night and day;
4595,THE SCULPTOR.,"And swift to hew the prison walls away,"
4596,THE SCULPTOR.,"The Sculptor toil'd, love-strengthen'd, from that hour."
4597,THE SCULPTOR.,
4598,THE SCULPTOR.,"He wrought with patience, and at length, amazed,"
4599,THE SCULPTOR.,"Beheld the mystic form all perfect stand,"
4600,THE SCULPTOR.,"Released in beauty by his artist hand,"
4601,THE SCULPTOR.,"He scarce knew how, and wonder'd as he gazed."
4602,THE SCULPTOR.,
4603,THE SCULPTOR.,It was a lovely form whose lifted arms
4604,THE SCULPTOR.,"Yearn'd towards heaven with all its radiant frame,"
4605,THE SCULPTOR.,As though the soul within on wings of flame
4606,THE SCULPTOR.,Up from the earth would waft its angel charms;
4607,THE SCULPTOR.,
4608,THE SCULPTOR.,But still one touch retain'd it to the ground;
4609,THE SCULPTOR.,So that the love that beam'd up from its eyes
4610,THE SCULPTOR.,"Flow'd evermore towards the distant skies,"
4611,THE SCULPTOR.,And yet to earth the shape remain'd spell-bound.
4612,THE SCULPTOR.,
4613,THE SCULPTOR.,The dream fell on him one calm summer night;
4614,THE SCULPTOR.,And thus in that fair form still heavenward turning
4615,THE SCULPTOR.,"Eternal aspiration, endless yearning,"
4616,THE SCULPTOR.,Stood now the Thought before his gladden'd sight.
