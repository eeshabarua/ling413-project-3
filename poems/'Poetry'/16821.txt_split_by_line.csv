84,THE BEST PIPE,"Is faultless, has been led astray"
85,THE BEST PIPE,"To nurse a high-born meerschaum bowl,"
86,THE BEST PIPE,For which he sweetly had to pay.
87,THE BEST PIPE,"Ah, let him nurse it as he may,"

101,THE BEST PIPE,"Clay, meerschaum, hookah, what are they"
102,THE BEST PIPE,That I should view them with desire?
103,THE BEST PIPE,"Both now, and when my hair is grey,"

168,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Short space shall be hereafter
169,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Ere April brings the hour
170,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"Of weeping and of laughter,"
171,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"Of sunshine and of shower,"

173,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"Of singing and of sadness,"
174,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"Of melody and madness,"
175,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Of all sweet things and sour.
176,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,
177,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Sweet to the blithe bucolic
178,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"Who knows nor cribs nor crams,"
179,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Who sees the frisky frolic
180,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Of lanky little lambs;
181,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,But sour beyond expression
182,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,To one in deep depression
183,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Who sees the closing session
184,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,And imminent exams.
185,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,
186,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,He cannot hear the singing
187,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"Of birds upon the bents,"
188,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"Nor watch the wildflowers springing,"
189,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Nor smell the April scents.
190,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"He gathers grief with grinding,"
191,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Foul food of sorrow finding
192,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,In books of dreary binding
193,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,And drearier contents.
194,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,
195,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"One hope alone sustains him,"
196,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"And no more hopes beside,"
197,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,One trust alone restrains him
198,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,From shocking suicide;
199,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,He will not play nor palter
200,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"With hemlock or with halter,"
201,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"He will not fear nor falter,"
202,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,Whatever chance betide.
203,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,
204,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,He knows examinations
205,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"Like all things else have ends,"
206,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,And then come vast vacations
207,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"And visits to his friends,"
208,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"And youth with pleasure yoking,"
209,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"And joyfulness and joking,"
210,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,"And smilingness and smoking,"
211,A SWINBURNIAN INTERLUDE,For grief to make amends.

228,SWEETHEART,
229,SWEETHEART,"I silent sit and let them speak,"
230,SWEETHEART,As men of strength
231,SWEETHEART,Allow the impotent and weak
232,SWEETHEART,To rail at length.
233,SWEETHEART,
234,SWEETHEART,"If they should tell me Love is blind,"
235,SWEETHEART,And so doth miss
236,SWEETHEART,"The faults which they are quick to find,"

442,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
443,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
444,ADVENTURE OF A POET,As I was walking down the street
445,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"A week ago,"
446,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Near Henderson's I chanced to meet
447,ADVENTURE OF A POET,A man I know.
448,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
449,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"His name is Alexander Bell,"
450,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"His home, Dundee;"
451,ADVENTURE OF A POET,I do not know him quite so well
452,ADVENTURE OF A POET,As he knows me.
453,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
454,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"He gave my hand a hearty shake,"
455,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Discussed the weather,"
456,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And then proposed that we should take
457,ADVENTURE OF A POET,A stroll together.
458,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
459,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Down College Street we took our way,"
460,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And there we met
461,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"The beautiful Miss Mary Gray,"
462,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"That arch coquette,"
463,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Who stole last spring my heart away
464,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And has it yet.
465,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
466,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"That smile with which my bow she greets,"
467,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Would it were fonder!
468,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Or else less fond--since she its sweets
469,ADVENTURE OF A POET,On all must squander.
470,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Thus, when I meet her in the streets,"
471,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"I sadly ponder,"
472,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"And after her, as she retreats,"
473,ADVENTURE OF A POET,My thoughts will wander.
474,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
475,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And so I listened with an air
476,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Of inattention,"
477,ADVENTURE OF A POET,While Bell described a folding-chair
478,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Of his invention.
479,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
480,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"And when we reached the Swilcan Burn,"
481,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"'It looks like rain,'"
482,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Said I, 'and we had better turn.'"
483,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"'Twas all in vain,"
484,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
485,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"For Bell was weather-wise, and knew"
486,ADVENTURE OF A POET,The signs aerial;
487,ADVENTURE OF A POET,He bade me note the strip of blue
488,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Above the Imperial,"
489,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
490,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Also another patch of sky,"
491,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"South-west by south,"
492,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Which meant that we might journey dry
493,ADVENTURE OF A POET,To Eden's mouth.
494,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
495,ADVENTURE OF A POET,He was a man with information
496,ADVENTURE OF A POET,On many topics:
497,ADVENTURE OF A POET,He talked about the exploration
498,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Of Poles and Tropics,"
499,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
500,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"The scene in Parliament last night,"
501,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Sir William's letter;
502,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"'And do you like the electric light,"
503,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Or gas-lamps better?'
504,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
505,ADVENTURE OF A POET,The strike among the dust-heap pickers
506,ADVENTURE OF A POET,He said was over;
507,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And had I read about the liquors
508,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Just seized at Dover?
509,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
510,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Or the unhappy printer lad
511,ADVENTURE OF A POET,At Rothesay drowned?
512,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Or the Italian ironclad
513,ADVENTURE OF A POET,That ran aground?
514,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
515,ADVENTURE OF A POET,He told me stories (lately come)
516,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Of good society,"
517,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Some slightly tinged with truth, and some"
518,ADVENTURE OF A POET,With impropriety.
519,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
520,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"He spoke of duelling in France,"
521,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Then lightly glanced at
522,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Mrs. Mackenzie's monster dance,"
523,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Which he had danced at.
524,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
525,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"So he ran on, till by-and-by"
526,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"A silence came,"
527,ADVENTURE OF A POET,For which I greatly fear that I
528,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Was most to blame.
529,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
530,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Then neither of us spoke a word
531,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"For quite a minute,"
532,ADVENTURE OF A POET,When presently a thought occurred
533,ADVENTURE OF A POET,With promise in it.
534,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
535,ADVENTURE OF A POET,'How did you like the Shakespeare play
536,ADVENTURE OF A POET,The students read?'
537,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"By this, the Eden like a bay"
538,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Before us spread.
539,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
540,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Near Eden many softer plots
541,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Of sand there be;
542,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Our feet, like Pharaoh's chariots,"
543,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Drave heavily.
544,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
545,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"And ere an answer I could frame,"
546,ADVENTURE OF A POET,He said that Irving
547,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Of his extraordinary fame
548,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Was undeserving,"
549,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
550,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And for his part he thought more highly
551,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Of Ellen Terry;
552,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Although he knew a girl named Riley
553,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"At Broughty Ferry,"
554,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
555,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Who might be, if she only chose,"
556,ADVENTURE OF A POET,As great a star.
557,ADVENTURE OF A POET,She had a part in the tableaux
558,ADVENTURE OF A POET,At the bazaar.
559,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
560,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"If I had said but little yet,"
561,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"I now said less,"
562,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And smoked a home-made cigarette
563,ADVENTURE OF A POET,In mute distress.
564,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
565,ADVENTURE OF A POET,The smoke into his face was blown
566,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"By the wind's action,"
567,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"And this afforded me, I own,"
568,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Some satisfaction;
569,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
570,ADVENTURE OF A POET,But still his tongue received no check
571,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Till, coming home,"
572,ADVENTURE OF A POET,We stood beside the ancient wreck
573,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And watched the foam
574,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
575,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Wash in among the timbers, now"
576,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Sunk deep in sand,"
577,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Though I can well remember how
578,ADVENTURE OF A POET,I used to stand
579,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
580,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"On windy days and hold my hat,"
581,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And idly turn
582,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"To read 'Lovise, Frederikstad'"
583,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Upon her stern.
584,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
585,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Her stern long since was buried quite,"
586,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And soon no trace
587,ADVENTURE OF A POET,The absorbing sand will leave in sight
588,ADVENTURE OF A POET,To mark her place.
589,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
590,ADVENTURE OF A POET,This reverie was not permitted
591,ADVENTURE OF A POET,To last too long.
592,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Bell's mind had left the stage, and flitted"
593,ADVENTURE OF A POET,To fields of song.
594,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
595,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And now he spoke of _Marmion_
596,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And Lewis Morris;
597,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"The former he at school had done,"
598,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Along with Horace.
599,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
600,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"His maiden aunts, no longer young,"
601,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"But learned ladies,"
602,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Had lately sent him _Songs Unsung_,"
603,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"_Epic of Hades_,"
604,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
605,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"_Gycia_, and _Gwen_.  He thought them fine;"
606,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Not like that Browning,"
607,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Of whom he would not read a line,"
608,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"He told me, frowning."
609,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
610,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Talking of Horace--very clever,"
611,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Beyond a doubt,"
612,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"But what the Satires meant, he never"
613,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Yet could make out.
614,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
615,ADVENTURE OF A POET,I said I relished Satire Nine
616,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Of the First Book;
617,ADVENTURE OF A POET,But he had skipped to the divine
618,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Eliza Cook.
619,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
620,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"He took occasion to declare,"
621,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"In tones devoted,"
622,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"How much he loved her old Arm-chair,"
623,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Which now he quoted.
624,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
625,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"And other poets he reviewed,"
626,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Some two or three,"
627,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Till, having touched on Thomas Hood,"
628,ADVENTURE OF A POET,He turned to me.
629,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
630,ADVENTURE OF A POET,'Have _you_ been stringing any rhymes
631,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Of late?' he said.
632,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"I could not lie, but several times"
633,ADVENTURE OF A POET,I shook my head.
634,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
635,ADVENTURE OF A POET,The last straw to the earth will bow
636,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"The o'erloaded camel,"
637,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And surely I resembled now
638,ADVENTURE OF A POET,That ill-used mammal.
639,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
640,ADVENTURE OF A POET,See how a thankless world regards
641,ADVENTURE OF A POET,The gifted choir
642,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Of minstrels, singers, poets, bards,"
643,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Who sweep the lyre.
644,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
645,ADVENTURE OF A POET,This is the recompense we meet
646,ADVENTURE OF A POET,In our vocation.
647,ADVENTURE OF A POET,We bear the burden and the heat
648,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Of inspiration;
649,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
650,ADVENTURE OF A POET,The beauties of the earth we sing
651,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"In glowing numbers,"
652,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And to the 'reading public' bring
653,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Post-prandial slumbers;
654,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
655,ADVENTURE OF A POET,We save from Mammon's gross dominion
656,ADVENTURE OF A POET,These sordid times . . .
657,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"And all this, in the world's opinion,"
658,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Is 'stringing rhymes.'
659,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
660,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"It is as if a man should say,"
661,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"In accents mild,"
662,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"'Have you been stringing beads to-day,"
663,ADVENTURE OF A POET,My gentle child?'
664,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
665,ADVENTURE OF A POET,(Yet even children fond of singing
666,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Will pay off scores,"
667,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And I to-day at least am stringing
668,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Not beads but bores.)
669,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
670,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"And now the sands were left behind,"
671,ADVENTURE OF A POET,The Club-house past.
672,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"I wondered, Can I hope to find"
673,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Escape at last,"
674,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
675,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Or must I take him home to tea,"
676,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And bear his chatter
677,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Until the last train to Dundee
678,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Shall solve the matter?
679,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
680,ADVENTURE OF A POET,But while I shuddered at the thought
681,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"And planned resistance,"
682,ADVENTURE OF A POET,My conquering Alexander caught
683,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Sight in the distance
684,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
685,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"Of two young ladies, one of whom"
686,ADVENTURE OF A POET,Is his ambition;
687,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"And so, with somewhat heightened bloom,"
688,ADVENTURE OF A POET,He asked permission
689,ADVENTURE OF A POET,
690,ADVENTURE OF A POET,To say good-bye to me and follow.
691,ADVENTURE OF A POET,"I freely gave it,"
692,ADVENTURE OF A POET,And wished him all success.  _Apollo_

2205,NOTES,For the information of those who have not the happiness to be members of
2206,NOTES,"the University of St. Andrews, it may be well to explain a few terms.  A"
2207,NOTES,_bejant_ is an undergraduate student of the first year.  In his second
2208,NOTES,"year he becomes a _semi_, in his third a _tertian_, and in his fourth a"
2209,NOTES,"_magistrand_.  The last would seem to be a gerundive form, implying that"
2210,NOTES,a man at the end of his fourth year ought to be made a Master of Arts;
2211,NOTES,but unfortunately this does not always happen.  A _divine_ is a student
2212,NOTES,in Divinity.  A _waster_ is a man of idle and (it may be) profligate
2213,NOTES,"habits.  A _grinder_, on the contrary, is one who 'grinds' or reads with"
2214,NOTES,an unusual degree of application.  A _bunk_ is the lodging or abode in
2215,NOTES,St. Andrews of any student.  A _spree_ is not necessarily an
2216,NOTES,entertainment of rowdy character; the most decorous Professorial dinner-
2217,NOTES,"party would be called a spree.  A _solatium_ is a Debating Society spree,"
2218,NOTES,held in December or January; a _gaudeamus_ is a festival of the same
2219,NOTES,"kind, only rather more ambitious, celebrated towards the close of the"
2220,NOTES,session.  _Session_ would be rendered in England by 'term.'  The
2221,NOTES,"_Competition_ (for _Bursaries_), or the 'Comp.,' is the examination for"
2222,NOTES,"entrance scholarships.  The _cage_ is a curious structure of glass, iron,"
2223,NOTES,"and wood, in which notices and examination lists are posted.  The letters"
2224,NOTES,_S. R. C_. denote the Students' Representative Council.  An _L.L.A_. is a
2225,NOTES,Lady Literate in Arts.  _Math_. (as the discerning reader will not be
2226,NOTES,"slow to perceive) is an abbreviation, endearing or otherwise, of the word"
2227,NOTES,Mathematics.  _Moral_ stands for Moral Philosophy.  _Prof_. is a
2228,NOTES,"shortened form of Professor, and _certif_. of certificate.  _Plough,"
2229,NOTES,"pluck_, and _spin_ are used indifferently, to signify the action of an"
2230,NOTES,examiner in rejecting a candidate for the M.A. or any other degree.  It
2231,NOTES,should be mentioned that the degree of B.A. is not now conferred by the
2232,NOTES,Universities of Scotland.
