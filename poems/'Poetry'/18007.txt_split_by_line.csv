110,JONGLEURS.,
111,JONGLEURS.,
112,JONGLEURS.,What is the stir in the street?
113,JONGLEURS.,Hurry of feet!
114,JONGLEURS.,"And after,"
115,JONGLEURS.,A sound as of pipes and of tabers!
116,JONGLEURS.,
117,JONGLEURS.,"Men of the conflicts and labors,"
118,JONGLEURS.,"Struggling and shifting and shoving,"
119,JONGLEURS.,"Pushing and pounding your neighbors,"
120,JONGLEURS.,"Fighting for leeway for laughter,"
121,JONGLEURS.,Toiling for leisure for loving!
122,JONGLEURS.,"Hark, through the window and up to the rafter,"
123,JONGLEURS.,"Madder and merrier,"
124,JONGLEURS.,"Deeper and verier,"
125,JONGLEURS.,"Sweeter, contrarier,"
126,JONGLEURS.,"Dafter and dafter,"
127,JONGLEURS.,"A song arises,--"
128,JONGLEURS.,"A thrill, an intrusion,"
129,JONGLEURS.,"A reel, an illusion,"
130,JONGLEURS.,"A rapture, a crisis"
131,JONGLEURS.,Of bells in the air!
132,JONGLEURS.,
133,JONGLEURS.,"Ay, up from your work and look out of the window!"
134,JONGLEURS.,"""Who are the newcomers, Arab or Hindoo?"
135,JONGLEURS.,"Persians, or Japs, or the children of Isis?"""
136,JONGLEURS.,"--Guesses, surmises--"
137,JONGLEURS.,"Forth with you, fare"
138,JONGLEURS.,Down in the street to draw nearer and stare!
139,JONGLEURS.,"Come from your palaces, come from your hovels!"
140,JONGLEURS.,"Lay down your ledgers, your picks and your shovels,"
141,JONGLEURS.,"Your trowels and bricks,"
142,JONGLEURS.,"Hammers and nails,"
143,JONGLEURS.,"Scythes and flails,"
144,JONGLEURS.,"Bargains and sales,"

153,JONGLEURS.,"Comments and scholia,"
154,JONGLEURS.,(World's melancholia)--
155,JONGLEURS.,"Cast them aside, and good riddance to rubbish!"
156,JONGLEURS.,"Here at the street-corner, hearken, a strain,"
157,JONGLEURS.,"Rough and off-hand and a bit rub-a-dub-ish,"
158,JONGLEURS.,Gives us a taste of the life we'd attain.
159,JONGLEURS.,
160,JONGLEURS.,"Who are they, what are they, whence have they come to us?"
161,JONGLEURS.,Where will they go when their singing is done?
162,JONGLEURS.,"What is the garb they wear, tattered and sumptuous,"
163,JONGLEURS.,Faded with days and superb in the sun?
164,JONGLEURS.,What are they singing of?
165,JONGLEURS.,Hush!
166,JONGLEURS.,... There's a ringing of
167,JONGLEURS.,Delicate chimes;
168,JONGLEURS.,And the blush
169,JONGLEURS.,Of a veiled bride morning
170,JONGLEURS.,Beats in the rhymes.
171,JONGLEURS.,Listen!
172,JONGLEURS.,"Out of the merriment,"
173,JONGLEURS.,Clear as the glisten
174,JONGLEURS.,"Of dew on the brier,"
175,JONGLEURS.,A silver warning!
176,JONGLEURS.,"Sudden, a dare--"
177,JONGLEURS.,Lyric experiment--
178,JONGLEURS.,"Up like a lark in the air,"
179,JONGLEURS.,"Higher and higher and higher,"
180,JONGLEURS.,The song shoots out of our blunder
181,JONGLEURS.,"Of thought to the blue sky of wonder,"
182,JONGLEURS.,And broken strains only fall down
183,JONGLEURS.,Like pearls on the roofs of the town.
184,JONGLEURS.,
185,JONGLEURS.,"Somebody says they have come from the moon,"
186,JONGLEURS.,"Seen with their eyes Eldorado,"
187,JONGLEURS.,"Sat in the Bo-tree's shadow,"
188,JONGLEURS.,Wandered at noon
189,JONGLEURS.,"In the valleys of Van,"
190,JONGLEURS.,"Tented in Lebanon, tarried in Ophir,"
191,JONGLEURS.,Last year in Tartary piped for the Khan.
192,JONGLEURS.,Now it's the song of a lover;
193,JONGLEURS.,"Now it's the lilt of a loafer,--"
194,JONGLEURS.,"Under the trees in a midsummer noon,"
195,JONGLEURS.,"Dreaming the haze into isles to discover,"
196,JONGLEURS.,Beating the silences into a croon;
197,JONGLEURS.,Soon
198,JONGLEURS.,Up from the marshes a fall of the plover!
199,JONGLEURS.,Out from the cover
200,JONGLEURS.,A flurry of quail!
201,JONGLEURS.,"Down from the height where the slow hawks hover,"
202,JONGLEURS.,The thin far ghost of a hail!
203,JONGLEURS.,"And near, and near,"
204,JONGLEURS.,"Throbbing and tingling,--"
205,JONGLEURS.,With a human cheer
206,JONGLEURS.,"In the earth-song mingling,--"
207,JONGLEURS.,"Mirth and carousal,"
208,JONGLEURS.,"Wooing, espousal,"
209,JONGLEURS.,Clinking of glasses
210,JONGLEURS.,And laughter of lasses--
211,JONGLEURS.,And the wind in the garden stoops down as it passes
212,JONGLEURS.,To play with the hair
213,JONGLEURS.,"Of the loveliest there,"
214,JONGLEURS.,And the wander-lust catches the will in its snare;
215,JONGLEURS.,"Hill-wind and spray-lure,"
216,JONGLEURS.,Call of the heath;
217,JONGLEURS.,Dare in the teeth
218,JONGLEURS.,Of the balk and the failure;
219,JONGLEURS.,The clasp and the linger
220,JONGLEURS.,"Of loosening finger,"
221,JONGLEURS.,Loth to dissever;
222,JONGLEURS.,Thrill of the comrade heart to its fellow
223,JONGLEURS.,Through droughts that sicken and blasts that bellow
224,JONGLEURS.,"From purple furrow to harvest yellow,"
225,JONGLEURS.,Now and forever.
226,JONGLEURS.,How our feet itch to keep time to their measure!
227,JONGLEURS.,How our hearts lift to the lilt of their song!
228,JONGLEURS.,"Let the world go, for a day's royal pleasure!"
229,JONGLEURS.,Not every summer such waifs come along.
230,JONGLEURS.,
231,JONGLEURS.,Now they are off to the inn;
232,JONGLEURS.,Hear the clean ring of their laughter!
233,JONGLEURS.,Cool as a hill-brook after
234,JONGLEURS.,The beat of the noon sets in!
235,JONGLEURS.,Gentlemen even in jollity--
236,JONGLEURS.,Certainly people of quality!--
237,JONGLEURS.,"Waifs and estrays no less,"
238,JONGLEURS.,"Roofless and penniless,"
239,JONGLEURS.,They are the wayside strummers
240,JONGLEURS.,"Whose lips are man's renown,"
241,JONGLEURS.,Those wayward brats of Summer's
242,JONGLEURS.,Who stroll from town to town;
243,JONGLEURS.,"Spendthrift of life, they ravish"
244,JONGLEURS.,"The days of an endless store,"
245,JONGLEURS.,And ever the more they lavish
246,JONGLEURS.,The heap of the hoard is more.
247,JONGLEURS.,For joy and love and vision
248,JONGLEURS.,Are alive and breed and stay
249,JONGLEURS.,When dust shall hold in derision
250,JONGLEURS.,The misers of a day.

261,EARTH'S LYRIC.,The sap feels a start.
262,EARTH'S LYRIC.,
263,EARTH'S LYRIC.,The snow-melted torrents are brawling;
264,EARTH'S LYRIC.,"The hills, orange-misted and blue,"
265,EARTH'S LYRIC.,Are touched with the voice of the rainbird
266,EARTH'S LYRIC.,Unsullied and new.

268,EARTH'S LYRIC.,"The houses of frost are deserted,"

280,EARTH'S LYRIC.,The revel of silence is over;
281,EARTH'S LYRIC.,Earth's lyric comes on.
282,EARTH'S LYRIC.,
283,EARTH'S LYRIC.,"A golden flute in the cedars,"
284,EARTH'S LYRIC.,"A silver pipe in the swales,"

286,EARTH'S LYRIC.,Wells bade and prevails.
287,EARTH'S LYRIC.,
288,EARTH'S LYRIC.,A breath of the woodland spirit

303,THE WOOD-GOD.,Thou lurkest in.
304,THE WOOD-GOD.,In vain--evasive ever through the glade
305,THE WOOD-GOD.,Departing footsteps fail;
306,THE WOOD-GOD.,"And only where the grasses have been pressed,"
307,THE WOOD-GOD.,Or by snapped twigs I follow a fruitless trail.
308,THE WOOD-GOD.,So--give o'er the quest!
309,THE WOOD-GOD.,Sprawl on the roots and moss!
310,THE WOOD-GOD.,Let the lithe garter squirm across my throat!
311,THE WOOD-GOD.,Let the slow clouds and leaves above me float
312,THE WOOD-GOD.,"Into mine eyeballs and across,--"
313,THE WOOD-GOD.,"Nor think them further! Lo, the marvel! now,"
314,THE WOOD-GOD.,"Thou whom my soul desireth, even thou"
315,THE WOOD-GOD.,"Sprawl'st by my side, who fled'st at my pursuit."
316,THE WOOD-GOD.,I hear thy fluting; at my shoulder there
317,THE WOOD-GOD.,"I see the sharp ears through the tangled hair,"
318,THE WOOD-GOD.,And birds and bunnies at thy music mute.

827,KARLENE.,
828,KARLENE.,And then when your classmates are singing
829,KARLENE.,"Once more for good-by the old glees,"
830,KARLENE.,And the round painted lanterns are swinging
831,KARLENE.,"And sputtering out in the trees,"
832,KARLENE.,

846,KARLENE.,And smiles condescension on me!
847,KARLENE.,
848,KARLENE.,"I shall loathe his immaculate breeding,"
849,KARLENE.,And advise you in time to refuse.
850,KARLENE.,"To think he will share in your reading,"
851,KARLENE.,And even unbutton your shoes!

1164,THE UNSAINTING OF KAVIN.,But even there he felt despair;
