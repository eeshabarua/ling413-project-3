72,HYMN TO LOVE,
73,HYMN TO LOVE,"We are thine, O Love, being in thee and made of thee,"
74,HYMN TO LOVE,"As thóu, Lóve, were the déep thóught"
75,HYMN TO LOVE,"And we the speech of the thought; yea, spoken are we,"
76,HYMN TO LOVE,Thy fires of thought out-spoken:
77,HYMN TO LOVE,
78,HYMN TO LOVE,But burn'd not through us thy imagining
79,HYMN TO LOVE,"Like fiérce móod in a sóng cáught,"
80,HYMN TO LOVE,"We were as clamour'd words a fool may fling,"
81,HYMN TO LOVE,"Loose words, of meaning broken."
82,HYMN TO LOVE,
83,HYMN TO LOVE,"For what more like the brainless speech of a fool,--"
84,HYMN TO LOVE,"The lives travelling dark fears,"
85,HYMN TO LOVE,And as a boy throws pebbles in a pool
86,HYMN TO LOVE,Thrown down abysmal places?
87,HYMN TO LOVE,
88,HYMN TO LOVE,"Hazardous are the stars, yet is our birth"
89,HYMN TO LOVE,And our journeying time theirs;
90,HYMN TO LOVE,"As words of air, life makes of starry earth"
91,HYMN TO LOVE,Sweet soul-delighted faces;
92,HYMN TO LOVE,
93,HYMN TO LOVE,As voices are we in the worldly wind;
94,HYMN TO LOVE,The great wind of the world's fate
95,HYMN TO LOVE,"Is turned, as air to a shapen sound, to mind"
96,HYMN TO LOVE,And marvellous desires.
97,HYMN TO LOVE,
98,HYMN TO LOVE,"But not in the world as voices storm-shatter'd,"
99,HYMN TO LOVE,Not borne down by the wind's weight;
100,HYMN TO LOVE,The rushing time rings with our splendid word
101,HYMN TO LOVE,Like darkness filled with fires.
102,HYMN TO LOVE,
103,HYMN TO LOVE,"For Love doth use us for a sound of song,"
104,HYMN TO LOVE,"And Love's meaning our life wields,"
105,HYMN TO LOVE,Making our souls like syllables to throng
106,HYMN TO LOVE,His tunes of exultation.
107,HYMN TO LOVE,
108,HYMN TO LOVE,"Down the blind speed of a fatal world we fly,"
109,HYMN TO LOVE,As rain blown along earth's fields;
110,HYMN TO LOVE,"Yet are we god-desiring liturgy,"
111,HYMN TO LOVE,Sung joys of adoration;
112,HYMN TO LOVE,
113,HYMN TO LOVE,"Yea, made of chance and all a labouring strife,"
114,HYMN TO LOVE,We go charged with a strong flame;
115,HYMN TO LOVE,For as a language Love hath seized on life
116,HYMN TO LOVE,His burning heart to story.
117,HYMN TO LOVE,
118,HYMN TO LOVE,"Yea, Love, we are thine, the liturgy of thee."
119,HYMN TO LOVE,"Thy thought's golden and glad name,"
120,HYMN TO LOVE,"The mortal conscience of immortal glee,"
121,HYMN TO LOVE,Love's zeal in Love's own glory.

135,PRELUDE,
136,PRELUDE,_Night on bleak downs; a high grass-grown trench runs
137,PRELUDE,athwart the slope. The earthwork is manned by
138,PRELUDE,"warriors clad in hides. Two warriors, BRYS and"
139,PRELUDE,"GAST, talking_."
140,PRELUDE,
141,PRELUDE,_Gast_.
142,PRELUDE,"This puts a tall heart in me, and a tune"
143,PRELUDE,"Of great glad blood flowing brave in my flesh,"
144,PRELUDE,"To see thee, after all these moons, returned,"
145,PRELUDE,"My Brys. If there's no rust in thy shoulder-joints,"
146,PRELUDE,"That battle-wrath of thine, and thy good throwing,"
147,PRELUDE,Will be more help for us than if the dyke
148,PRELUDE,Were higher by a span.--Ha! there was howling
149,PRELUDE,"Down in the thicket; they come soon, for sure."
150,PRELUDE,
151,PRELUDE,_Brys_.
152,PRELUDE,Has there been hunger in the forest long?
153,PRELUDE,
154,PRELUDE,_Gast_.
155,PRELUDE,"I think, not only hunger makes them fierce:"
156,PRELUDE,"They broke not long since into a village yonder,"
157,PRELUDE,A huge throng of them; all through the night we heard
158,PRELUDE,The feasting they kept up. And that has made
159,PRELUDE,"The wolves blood-thirsty, I believe."
160,PRELUDE,
161,PRELUDE,_Brys_.
162,PRELUDE,O fools
163,PRELUDE,To keep so slack a waking on their dykes!
164,PRELUDE,Now have they made a sleepless winter for us.
165,PRELUDE,"Every night we must look, lest the down-slope"
166,PRELUDE,Between us and the woods turn suddenly
167,PRELUDE,"To a grey onrush full of small green candles,"
168,PRELUDE,The charging pack with eyes flaming for flesh.
169,PRELUDE,And well for us then if there's no more mist
170,PRELUDE,Than the white panting of the wolfish hunger.
171,PRELUDE,
172,PRELUDE,_Gast_.
173,PRELUDE,They'll come to-night. Three of us hunting went
174,PRELUDE,Among the trees below: not long we stayed.
175,PRELUDE,"All the wolves of the world are in the forest,"
176,PRELUDE,And man's the meat they're after.
177,PRELUDE,
178,PRELUDE,_Brys_.
179,PRELUDE,"Ay, it must be"
180,PRELUDE,"Blood-thirst is in them, if they come to-night,"
181,PRELUDE,"Such clear and starry weather.--What dost thou make,"
182,PRELUDE,"Gast, of the stars?"
183,PRELUDE,
184,PRELUDE,_Gast_.
185,PRELUDE,"Brother, they're horrible."
186,PRELUDE,I always keep my head as much as I may
187,PRELUDE,Bent so they cannot look me in the eyes.
188,PRELUDE,
189,PRELUDE,_Brys_.
190,PRELUDE,I never had this awe. The fear I have
191,PRELUDE,"Is not a load I crouch beneath, but something"
192,PRELUDE,"Proud and wonderful, that lifteth my heart."
193,PRELUDE,"Yea, I look on a night of stars with fear"
194,PRELUDE,That comes close against glee. 'Tis like the fear
195,PRELUDE,"I have for the wolves, that maketh me joy-mad"
196,PRELUDE,To drive the yellow flint-edge through their shags.
197,PRELUDE,"So when I gaze on stars, they speak high fear"
198,PRELUDE,Into my soul; and strangely I think they mean
199,PRELUDE,The fear must prompt me to some unknown war.
200,PRELUDE,
201,PRELUDE,_Gast_.
202,PRELUDE,Be thou well ware of this. I have not told thee
203,PRELUDE,"How the stars, with their perilous overlooking,"
204,PRELUDE,"Have raught away from all his manhood Gwat,"
205,PRELUDE,Our fiercest strength. For when the conquering wolves
206,PRELUDE,"Into that village won, we in our huts"
207,PRELUDE,Lay hearkening to their rejoicing hunger;
208,PRELUDE,But Gwat stayed out in the stars all night long.
209,PRELUDE,"I peered at him as much as that whipt dog,"
210,PRELUDE,"My heart, had daring for; and he stood stiff,"
211,PRELUDE,With all his senses aiming at the noise.
212,PRELUDE,Some strong bad eagerness kept tightly rigged
213,PRELUDE,"The cordage of his body, till his nerves"
214,PRELUDE,"Loosed on a sudden. He yelled, ""What do we here,"
215,PRELUDE,"High up among bleak winds, always afraid"
216,PRELUDE,Of murder from the wolves? I will be man
217,PRELUDE,No more; the grey four-footed fellows have
218,PRELUDE,"The good meats of the world, and the best lodging,"
219,PRELUDE,"Forest and weald."" And then he wolfish howled,"
220,PRELUDE,And hurled off towards the snarling and the baying.
221,PRELUDE,And now his soul wears the strength and fury
222,PRELUDE,Of a huge dun-pelted wolf; he's the wolves' king;
223,PRELUDE,And the fiends have learnt from him to laugh at our flints.
224,PRELUDE,"Now always in the assaults there's one great beast,"
225,PRELUDE,"With yellow eyes and hackles like a mane,"
226,PRELUDE,"That plays the captain, first to reach the dyke;"
227,PRELUDE,And I have heard that when he stands upright
228,PRELUDE,"To ramp against the bulwarks, in his throat"
229,PRELUDE,Are chattering yelps half tongued to grisly words.
230,PRELUDE,"Doubtless to-night thou'lt see him, leading his pack,"
231,PRELUDE,And with his jaws savagely tampering
232,PRELUDE,"With our earth-builded safety.--But now, Brys,"
233,PRELUDE,Is it not certain that the stars have done
234,PRELUDE,"This evil to Gwat's heart, and curdled all"
235,PRELUDE,The manhood in him?
236,PRELUDE,
237,PRELUDE,_Brys_.
238,PRELUDE,"When I was wanderer,"
239,PRELUDE,"I came upon a lake, set in a land"
240,PRELUDE,Which has no fear of wolves. A fisher folk
241,PRELUDE,"Live there in houses stilted over the water,"
242,PRELUDE,And the stars walk like spectres of white fire
243,PRELUDE,Upon the misty waters of the mere.
244,PRELUDE,"Ay, if they have no wolves, they have the fear"
245,PRELUDE,All as thou hast; the sedges in the night
246,PRELUDE,"Shudder, and out of the reeds there comes a cry"
247,PRELUDE,"Half chuckling, half bewailing; but, as I think,"
248,PRELUDE,It is the mallard calling. Now among
249,PRELUDE,"This haunted folk, I markt a man who went"
250,PRELUDE,"With shining eyes, and a joy in his face, about"
251,PRELUDE,His needs of living. Clear it was to me
252,PRELUDE,He knew of some sweet race in his daily wont
253,PRELUDE,"Which blest him wonderly. I lived with him,"
254,PRELUDE,"And from him learnt marvels. Yea, for he gave me"
255,PRELUDE,A wit to see in our earth more than fear.
256,PRELUDE,"Brother, how shall I tell thee, who hast still"
257,PRELUDE,"Fear-poisoned nerves, that like a priest he brewed"
258,PRELUDE,My heart keen drink from out the look of earth?--
259,PRELUDE,"Gast, is it nothing to thee that all in green"
260,PRELUDE,The wolds go heaping up against the blue?
261,PRELUDE,And is it only fear to thee that night
262,PRELUDE,"Is thatched with stars?--Ah, but I took his wit"
263,PRELUDE,Further than he e'er did; in women I found
264,PRELUDE,The same amazement for my wakened eyes
265,PRELUDE,"As in the hills and waters. Ay, gape at me,"
266,PRELUDE,And think me bitten by some evil tooth;
267,PRELUDE,But as a quiet stream at the cliff's edge
268,PRELUDE,"Breaks its smooth habit into a loud white force,"
269,PRELUDE,So this delight the earth pours over me
270,PRELUDE,"Leaps out of women with such excellence,"
271,PRELUDE,"It seems as I must brace my sinews to it,--"
272,PRELUDE,"The comely fashion of their limbs, their eyes,"
273,PRELUDE,"Their gait, and the way they use their arms. And now"
274,PRELUDE,My eyes have a message to my heart from them
275,PRELUDE,Such as thou only through a blind skin hast.
276,PRELUDE,"Therefore I came back here;--I scarce know why,"
277,PRELUDE,But now that women are to me not only
278,PRELUDE,"The sacred friends of hidden Awe, not only"
279,PRELUDE,"Mistresses of the world's unseen foison,"
280,PRELUDE,"Ay, and not only ease for throbbing groins,"
281,PRELUDE,"But things mine eyes enjoy as mine ears take songs,"
282,PRELUDE,"Vision that beats a timbrel in my blood,"
283,PRELUDE,"Dreams for my sleeping sight, that move aired round"
284,PRELUDE,"With wonder, as trembling covers a hearth,--"
285,PRELUDE,"It seems I must be fighting for them, must"
286,PRELUDE,Run through some danger to them now before
287,PRELUDE,Delighting in them. I am here to fight
288,PRELUDE,"Wolves for the joy of the world, marvellous women!"
289,PRELUDE,
290,PRELUDE,_Gast_.
291,PRELUDE,Star-madden'd! What is this in earth and women
292,PRELUDE,That pricks thee into wrath against the wolves?
293,PRELUDE,Do I not fight for women too? But I
294,PRELUDE,"For what is certain in them, not for madness."
295,PRELUDE,
296,PRELUDE,_Brys_.
297,PRELUDE,I make my fierceness of a mind to set
298,PRELUDE,"My spirit high up in the winds of joy,"
299,PRELUDE,Before I tumble down into the darkness.
300,PRELUDE,Not thus thy women send thee to thy fighting:
301,PRELUDE,"All fear thy battle-courage is, fear-bred"
302,PRELUDE,"Thine anger. Thou heavily drudgest women,"
303,PRELUDE,But yet thou art afraid of them.
304,PRELUDE,
305,PRELUDE,_Gast_.
306,PRELUDE,"Ay, truly;"
307,PRELUDE,For look how from their wondrous bodies comes
308,PRELUDE,Increase: who knoweth where such power ends?
309,PRELUDE,They are in league with the great Motherhood
310,PRELUDE,Who brings the seasons forth in the open world;
311,PRELUDE,"And if to them She hands, unseen by us,"
312,PRELUDE,"Their marvellous bringing forth of children, what"
313,PRELUDE,"Spirit of Her great dreadful mountain-spell,"
314,PRELUDE,"Wherein the rocks have purpose against us,"
315,PRELUDE,"Sealed up in watchful quiet stone, may not"
316,PRELUDE,"Pass on to their dark minds, that seem so mild,"
317,PRELUDE,Yet are so strange; or what charm'd word from out
318,PRELUDE,"Her forests whispering endless dangerous things,"
319,PRELUDE,Wherefrom our hunters often have run crazed
320,PRELUDE,To hear the trees devising for their souls;
321,PRELUDE,What secret share of Her earth's monstrous power
322,PRELUDE,May She not also grant to women's lives?
323,PRELUDE,"Yea, wise is our fear of women; but we fight"
324,PRELUDE,For more than fear; we give them liking too.
325,PRELUDE,Who but the women can deliver us
326,PRELUDE,From this continual siege of the wolves' hunger?
327,PRELUDE,"High above comfort, on the shrugging backs"
328,PRELUDE,"Of downland, where the winds parch our skins, and frost"
329,PRELUDE,Kneads through our flesh until his fingers clamp
330,PRELUDE,"The aching bones, our scanty families"
331,PRELUDE,"Hold out against the ravin of the wolves,"
332,PRELUDE,"Fended by earthwork, fighting them with flint."
333,PRELUDE,"But if we keep the favour of our women,"
334,PRELUDE,They will breed sons to us so many and strong
335,PRELUDE,We shall have numbers that will make us dare
336,PRELUDE,"Invade the weather-shelter'd woods, and build"
337,PRELUDE,Villages where now only wolves are denn'd;
338,PRELUDE,"Yea, to the beasts shall the man-folk become"
339,PRELUDE,"Malice that haunts their ways, even as now"
340,PRELUDE,Our leaguer'd tribes must lurk and crouch afraid
341,PRELUDE,Of wolfish malice always baying near.
342,PRELUDE,"And fires, stackt hugely high with timber, shall"
343,PRELUDE,"With nightlong blaze make friendly the dark and cold,"
344,PRELUDE,"Cheer our bodies, and roast great feasts of flesh,--"
345,PRELUDE,"Ah, to burn trunks of trees, not bracken and ling!"
346,PRELUDE,"This is what women are to me,--a fear"
347,PRELUDE,"Lest the earth-hidden Awe, who unseen gives"
348,PRELUDE,"The childing to their flesh, should make their minds"
349,PRELUDE,"As darkly able as their wombs, with power"
350,PRELUDE,To think sorceries over us; and hope
351,PRELUDE,That with their breeding they will dispossess
352,PRELUDE,"The beasts of the good lowlands, until man,"
353,PRELUDE,"No longer fled to the hills, inhabit all"
354,PRELUDE,The comfort of the earth.
355,PRELUDE,
356,PRELUDE,_Brys_.
357,PRELUDE,"These are mine too,"
358,PRELUDE,But as great rivers own the brook's young speed.
359,PRELUDE,"For in my soul, the women do not dwell"
360,PRELUDE,"A torch going through darkness, with a troop"
361,PRELUDE,Of shadows gesturing after; but as the sun
362,PRELUDE,"Upon his height of golden blaze at noon,"
363,PRELUDE,With all the size of the blue air about him.
364,PRELUDE,Fear that in women the unseen is seen
365,PRELUDE,"And the unknown power sits beside us known,--"
366,PRELUDE,"This fear is good, but better is than this"
367,PRELUDE,"Their beauty, and the wells of joy in women."
368,PRELUDE,"I speak dumb words to thee; but know thou, Gast,"
369,PRELUDE,"My soul is looking at the time to come,"
370,PRELUDE,And seeing it not as a cavern lit
371,PRELUDE,"With smoky burning brandons of thy fear,"
372,PRELUDE,But as a day shining with my new joy.
373,PRELUDE,Thou canst not fight with me for the coming heart
374,PRELUDE,"Of man,--fear cannot fight with joy. And I"
375,PRELUDE,"Am setting such a war of joy against thee,"
376,PRELUDE,It shall be as man's heart became a god
377,PRELUDE,Murdering thy mind of weakling darkness.
378,PRELUDE,All the hot happiness of being wroth
379,PRELUDE,"And seeing a stroke leave behind it wound,"
380,PRELUDE,"The pleasures of wily hunting, and a feast"
381,PRELUDE,"After long famine, and the dancing stored"
382,PRELUDE,"Within the must of berries,--these, and all"
383,PRELUDE,Gladdenings that make thrill the being of man
384,PRELUDE,"Shall pour, mixt with an unknown rage of glee,"
385,PRELUDE,Into the meaning men shall find in women.
386,PRELUDE,"And if we have at all a fear of them,"
387,PRELUDE,"It shall not be the old ignorant dismay,"
388,PRELUDE,"But of their very potency to delight,"
389,PRELUDE,The way their looks make Will an enemy
390,PRELUDE,"Hating itself, shall men become afraid."
391,PRELUDE,Women shall cause men know for why they have
392,PRELUDE,Being in the earth;--not to be quailing slack
393,PRELUDE,"As if the whole world were a threat, but tuned"
394,PRELUDE,Ready for joy as harp-strings for the player.
395,PRELUDE,And great desire of beauty and to be glad
396,PRELUDE,"Shall prompt our courages. Ha, what are those"
397,PRELUDE,Breaking from out the thickets?
398,PRELUDE,
399,PRELUDE,_Gast_.

418,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,My lord requires me here.
419,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,
420,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,_Ahasuerus_.
421,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Does Heaven see this?
422,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Dare I have this one humble unto me?
423,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Was it not enough, Stars, to have given me"
424,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,This marriage? but you must persuade your God
425,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,To have me as well the greatest king beneath you!
426,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Look you now if men grow not insolent
427,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Because of me, a man so throned, so wived."
428,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Yea, and in me insolent groweth my love;"
429,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,For if the wheels of the careering world
430,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Brake, felley and spoke, that, pitching on the road,"
431,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"It spilt the driving godhead from his seat,"
432,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And the unreined team of hours riskily dragg'd
433,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Their crippled duty,--if in that lurching world"
434,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Like jarred glass my power shattered about me,"
435,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"And I were a head unking'd, 'twere but a game,"
436,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"So I were left possessing thee, and that"
437,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Escape from Heaven, the beauty that goes with thee."
438,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Here is an insolence! Hast thou not wonder'd,"
439,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Vashti, what gave thee into such a love,"
440,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"That in the brain of me, the chosen king,"
441,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"It is so loud, so insolent, thy love?"
442,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,O this shrill sweet heart-mastering love!
443,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,
444,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,_Vashti_.
445,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Alas,"
446,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Do I deserve that love?--But yes, I wonder;"
447,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,For what am I that the king loveth me?
448,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Lo, I am woman, thou art man, the lord;"
449,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Out of mere bounty are we loved of you,"
450,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And not for our deserving. We are to sit
451,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"In a high calm, and not go down and help"
452,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Among the toil, and choosing, chosen, find"
453,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Companionship therein. For thou, for man"
454,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Has such a treasure in his heart of love,"
455,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"It must be squandered out in charity,"
456,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Not used as a gentle money to repay
457,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Worth (as a woman spends her love). A trick
458,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Of posture in a girl, and see the alms"
459,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Of generous love man will enrich her with!
460,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Might there not be sometimes too much of alms
461,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,About his love? But we will blink at that.
462,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Yet sometimes we are liked ashamed, to be"
463,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Taking so much love from you, all for naught."
464,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Now therefore tell me, Man, my king, my master:"
465,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Lovest thou me, or dost thou rather love"
466,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The pleasure thou hast in me? This is not nice,"
467,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Believe me. They're more sundered, these two loves,"
468,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Than if all the braving seas marcht between them.
469,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,
470,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,_Ahasuerus_.
471,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"What, shrinking from thine own delightsomeness?"
472,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Hear then. Nature, so ordered from the God,"
473,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Has given strength to man and work to do,"
474,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,But to woman gave that she should be delight
475,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"For man, else like an overdriven ox"
476,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Heart-broke. The world was made for man, but made"
477,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Wisely a steep difficulty to be climbed,"
478,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"That he, so labouring the stubborn slant,"
479,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"May step from off the world with a well-used courage,"
480,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"All slouch disgrace fought out of him, a man"
481,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Well worthy of a Heaven. And this great part
482,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Has woman in the work; that man, fordone"
483,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"And wearied, may find lodging out of the noise"
484,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Upon her breast, and looking in her eyes"
485,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"May wash in pools of kindness, fresh as Heaven,"
486,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,The soil of sweat and trouble from his limbs;
487,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And turning aside into this pleasant inn
488,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Called woman, there is entertainment kept"
489,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"For man, such that for cheating craftily"
490,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,The stabled palter'd heart that it can pass
491,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Through the world's grillage and be large as fate,"
492,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,The sweet anxiety of reeded pipes
493,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Is a mere thing to it. Like Heaven street
494,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"When the steel of God's army surges through it,"
495,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Bright anger burning on an errand of swords,"
496,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,So is the sense of man when woman-joy
497,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Pours through his flesh a throng of deity,"
498,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"White clamorous flame; yea, desire of woman"
499,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Maketh the mind of more room for amazement
500,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Than that blue loft hath for the light, more charged"
501,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,With spiritual joy that goes in stress
502,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"As far as tears, with this more throbbingly charged"
503,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Than the starr'd night wept full of silver fires,--"
504,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Dangerously endured, labours of joy!"
505,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Is it not virtuous, not powerful, this?"
506,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Wouldst thou have more? Man knows he can possess
507,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Than woman's beauty nought more treasurable.
508,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And high above our loud activities
509,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"We keep, pure as the dawn, the house of love,"
510,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Woman, wherein we entering leave outside"
511,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Our rank sweat-drenchèd weeds of toil, and there"
512,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Enjoy ourselves, out of the world, awhile."
513,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,
514,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,_Vashti (aside)_.
515,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"O yes, I know. Filthiness! Filthiness!"
516,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,
517,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,_Ahasuerus_.
518,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Now here have I been toiling under press
519,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Of glory. Should I not stumble in my gait,"
520,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Were there no Vashti, and with her a welcome"
521,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"I do not need to buy, since all she wants"
522,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Is that I love her? Going in unto her
523,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"I may unstrap my burdenous pack of kingship,"
524,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Shift me of reign, and escape my splendour."
525,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Yea, and strange largeness in this power of love"
526,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,For men too much limited! Now I am sick
527,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Of knowing my greatness, now I want to be"
528,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Placed where my soul can feel vast room about me,"
529,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"To be contained. Outside, among the men,"
530,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,I am the room of the world; I and my rule
531,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Contain the world; and I am sick thereof.
532,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Vashti can remedy this; for here thy beauty
533,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"More spacious is for my senses to be in,"
534,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Than his own golden kingdom for the sun.
535,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,
536,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,_Vashti_.
537,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Thine eyes are glad with me? I please the King?
538,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,
539,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,_Ahasuerus_.
540,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Eyes? But there is no nerve thou takest not,"
541,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"No way of my life thronging not with thee,"
542,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And my blood sounds at the story of thy beauty.
543,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,What thing shall be held up to woman's beauty?
544,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Where are the bounds of it? Yea, what is all"
545,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The world, but an awning scaffolded amid"
546,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The waste perilous Eternity, to lodge"
547,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"This Heaven-wander'd princess, woman's beauty?"
548,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The East and West kneel down to thee, the North"
549,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"And South, and all for thee their shoulders bear"
550,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,The load of fourfold place. As yellow morn
551,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Runs on the slippery waves of the spread sea,"
552,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Thy feet are on the griefs and joys of men
553,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"That sheen to be thy causey. Out of tears,"
554,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Indeed, and blitheness, murder and lust and love,"
555,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Whatever has been passionate in clay,"
556,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Thy flesh was tempered. Behold in thy body
557,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The yearnings of all men measured and told,"
558,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Insatiate endless agonies of desire
559,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Given thy flesh, the meaning of thy shape!"
560,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"What beauty is there, but thou makest it?"
561,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"How is earth good to look on, woods and fields"
562,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The seasons' garden, and the courageous hills,"
563,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,All this green raft of earth moored in the seas?
564,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The manner of the sun to ride the air,"
565,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,The stars God has imagined for the night?
566,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"What's this behind them, that we cannot near,"
567,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Secret still on the point of being blabbed,"
568,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,The ghost in the world that flies from being named?
569,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Where do they get their beauty from, all these?"
570,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"They do but glaze a lantern lit for man,"
571,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And woman's beauty is the flame therein
572,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Feeding on sacred oil, man's desire,"
573,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,A golden flame possessing all the earth.
574,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Or as a queen upon an embassage
575,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"From out some mountain-guarded far renown,"
576,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Brings caravans stockt from her slavish mines,"
577,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Her looms and forges, with a precious friendship;"
578,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,So comest thou from the chambers of the stars
579,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,On thy famed visit unto man the king;
580,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"So bringing from the mints and shops of Heaven,"
581,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Where thou didst own labours of all the fates,"
582,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"A shining traffic, all that man calls beauty:"
583,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,There is no holding out for the heart of man
584,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Against thee and such custom. O hard to be borne,"
585,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Often hard to be borne is woman's beauty!--
586,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And well I guess it does but cover up
587,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Enmity, hanging falseness between our souls,"
588,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And buy at a dishonest price the mouth
589,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"True nature hath for thee, to speak thee fair."
590,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Were not man's thought so gilded with thy beauty,"
591,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Woman, and caught in the desire of thee,"
592,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"O, there'ld be hatred in his use of thee."
593,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,You should be thankful for your pleasantness!
594,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,
595,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,_Vashti_.
596,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Yes, I am thankful. For I hope, my lord,"
597,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"We women know our style. Ay, we are fooled"
598,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Sometimes with heady tampering thoughts, that come"
599,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"To bother our submission, I confess."
600,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"We to ourselves have said, that when God took"
601,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,The fierce beginning of the unwrought world
602,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"From out his fiery passion, and, breathing cool,"
603,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Tamed the wild molten being, with his hands"
604,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Fashion'd and workt the hot clay into world,"
605,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Then with green mercy quieted the land
606,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"And claspt it with the summer of blue seas,"
607,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"With brooches of white spray along the shores,--"
608,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,It was to be an equal dwelling-place
609,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"For humans that he did it, into sex"
610,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Unknowably dividing human kind.
611,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,But wickedly we say this. God made man
612,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"For his delight and praise, and then made woman"
613,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"For man's delight and praise, submiss to man."
614,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Else wherefore sex? And it is better thus,"
615,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"To be man's pleasure. What noble work is ours,"
616,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"To have our bodies proper for your love,"
617,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The means of your delight! Ay, and minds too,"
618,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Sometimes; we think, we women think we know"
619,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"What shape of mind pleases our masters best,"
620,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"And that we build up in us. A tender shyness,"
621,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"A coy reluctancy,--we use these well."
622,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Man is our master; it is best for us
623,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Persuading him line our captivity
624,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"With wool-soft love, lest it be bitter iron."
625,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,
626,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,_Ahasuerus_.
627,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"This is the marvel's head, that thou, so fair,"
628,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"And loved by me, should keep so good a mind."
629,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"--They shall not see thee, when I display at large"
630,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,The riches and the honour; I've enough
631,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Possession, without thee, to stupify"
632,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The assembly of my men, my herd of kings."
633,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,I mean there shall not be a hint of doubt
634,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"About whose world this is. So I have bid,"
635,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"From all the utter regions of my land,"
636,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The kings whom I allow to rule, who breathe"
637,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"My air, to feast with me and for a while"
638,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Flatter their trivial lives with a brief relish
639,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Of being king of the world's kings in Shushan.
640,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Yea, and I will dismay their wits with splendour;"
641,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,No noise shall be against me in the world.
642,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"I am more open, kinder than Lord God,"
643,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Who never shows how much he has of thunder;
644,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Wherefore against him men presume, and go"
645,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Often out of his ways extravagant.
646,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,But all the fear I keep obedient by me
647,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Now to the gather'd world I openly shew.
648,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"So God is spoken against, I am never,"
649,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And I have a better terror in the world;
650,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And chiefly for the happiness built round me
651,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Divinely firm. O all the kings, my men,"
652,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Shall fear this terrible happiness of mine!
653,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,But thee I will not shew; I'll have some wealth
654,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Not public. I'll have no adulteries,"
655,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,No eyes but mine enjoying thee. To me
656,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"The sight of thee, all as the touch of thee,"
657,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Belongeth, only my pleasure thou art:"
658,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"None but my senses shall come unto thee,"
659,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,And I will keep my pleasure pure as Heaven.
660,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,"Happy art thou, Vashti, to have wedded"
661,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,One who so dearly rates possession of thee.
662,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Better it is to spend my heart on thee
663,AHASUERUS AND VASHTI,Than on any of the women that I have.

676,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"This day unshar'd; and it is all mine,"
677,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,All that the Gods from baseless fires and steams
678,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Have harden'd into the place and kind of the world:
679,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The great high quiet journey of the stars,"
680,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And all the golden hours which the sun
681,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Utters aloft in heaven;--the whole is mine

683,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"This one day, I am where Heaven and I"
684,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Commonly stand together; you shall not have
685,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Shelter from me in a worshipt God to-day,"
686,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Kings; look yonder at many-power'd night,"
687,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Telling her beauty to the sea and taking
688,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The prone adoring waters into her blue
689,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Desire, setting them as herself on flame"
690,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"With perils of joy, lending them her achieved"

696,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And why I am so kindled in my soul.
697,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Who has been like to me? My name travels
698,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"A hundred seven and twenty languages,"
699,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"My name a ship upon them, trading fear."
700,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,My unseen power weighs upon the heads
701,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of nations, like the blown abasement given"
702,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,By sedges when they are wretched to the wind.
703,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Ay, and the farthest goings of the air"
704,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Can reach no land my taxes do not labour.

712,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Only a penal sun, that are so chapt"
713,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"In winds of my sent spirit: I care not, I."
714,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,For as my flesh out of my father's joy

725,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Upon my journeying soul into this world's
726,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Affairs, like smouldering fire besiegers throw"
727,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Among a city's roofs, which cannot choose"
728,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,But take blaze from the whole town's timber; so
729,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,My soul's desire for flame hath charred the world.
730,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Till now, as the night full of perfect fires,"
731,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"I, full of conquests, am large over you."
732,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And you must be like waters underneath me,"
733,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Full of my burning; there's no more for me
734,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Now, but to dwell alone in my still soul's"
735,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Hoarding of ecstasies, a great place of lusts"
736,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Achieved and shining fixt; for every man
737,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Is mine, and every soil is mine, from here"
738,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Round to the furthest cliffs that steadfast are
739,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,To keep the hoofs of the sea from murdering
740,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The tilled leagues of the land. And by the coasts
741,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"I am not kept. Far into the room of waters,"
742,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Into the blue middle of ocean's summer,"
743,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The white gait of my sea-going war invades.
744,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"I have a man here, one who makes with words,"
745,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And he shall be my messenger to your hearts.
746,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Not to make much of me; but he's the speech
747,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of Spirit,--I the dangerous exultation,"
748,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The Spirit's sacred joy in wrath against
749,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The heaps of its own spent kinds, melting anew"
750,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,To found in another image of itself.
751,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"He is the man to shew you, withinside"
752,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The flashing and exclaim of my great moving
753,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,About the places of the world; within
754,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The heat of my pleasure that has molten down,"
755,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Like ingots in a furnace, all your nations"
756,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Into my likeness treading on the earth;
757,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Within the smokes that make your eyes pour grief,"
758,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"This gleam of infinite purpose quietly nested,--"
759,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"That I am given the world, and that my pleasure"
760,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Is plain the latest word spoken by God.
761,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"So while our senses go among these wines,"
762,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Wander in green deliciousness and crimson,"
763,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And fragrance searches the else-unsearchable brain,"
764,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Poet, tell out the glory of the king."
765,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,
766,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,_The Poet_.
767,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The glory of the king of all the kings.--
768,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"You with the golden power on your brows,"
769,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"You kings, I think you know not what you are."
770,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,First you shall learn yourselves: for neither light
771,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Understandeth itself, nor darkness light."
772,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,You see your glory; but you cannot see
773,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,That which your glory conquers; and the peoples
774,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Know nought but that the glooming of their night
775,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Maketh a shining scope for crowns, as he,"
776,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Even as he, your king, Ahasuerus,"
777,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Maketh your splendour a darkness for his light.
778,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"But I, neither belonging to the kings"
779,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Nor to the people, only I may know"
780,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The golden fortune of light anointing kings.
781,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Come with me now, and take my vision awhile."
782,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The people of this world are misery.
783,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,What doth Man here? How thinketh God on him?
784,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Surely he was sent here as if thereby
785,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,God might forget him. Like infamous desire
786,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"A wise heart puts aside, which yet remains"
787,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"A secret hated memory, man was"
788,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"In God, and is vainly discarded here."
789,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,I see him coming here; I see man's life
790,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Falling into this base and desert ground,"
791,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,This world that seems an evil riddance thrown
792,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Down by the winds of God's swift purposes;
793,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Some shame of grossness, that would cling upon"
794,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The errand of their holy speed, and here"
795,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Heapt up and strewn into the place wherein
796,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The mind and being of man wander darkly.
797,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Behold him coming here!--Against my sight,"
798,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Warning aback the gleam of sacred heaven,"
799,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Is vast forbiddance raised; creatures like hills,"
800,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Or darkness surging at the coasts of light,"
801,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Stand, a great barricade behind our lives,"
802,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Rankt as Eternity had put on stature.
803,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The sharp sides of the peaks are finger'd white
804,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"With flame, lit by the fires of God beyond;"
805,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The rest is night; the whole people of dark hills
806,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,A front of high impenetrable doom.
807,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,But lo!
808,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Black in the blackness, is a yawn in the doom,"
809,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And out of it flows the kind of man. Behold,"
810,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"It is a river, through the permission sent"
811,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,As through a snarling breakage in a cliff;
812,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Turned like a hated thing away from God;
813,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Spat out, the water of man's life, to spill"
814,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Down bleak gullies, and thrid the gangways dark"
815,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Through the reluctant hills, pouring as if"
816,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"It knew God were ashamed of it. And thence,"
817,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Rejected down the abhorring steeps, man's life"
818,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Is wasted in this country, set to run"
819,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"A blind, ignorant, unremembered course,"
820,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Treading with hopeless feet of griev'd waters
821,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Unending unblest spaces, the shameful road"
822,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of dirt thickening into slime its flow,"
823,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"An insane weather driving. For at the issue,"
824,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Hovering mightily fledge to beat it on,"
825,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"A climate of demon's wings o'erarches man,"
826,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The hatred God has sent pursuing him.
827,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Fierce hawking spirits wrong him, hungry Cold,"
828,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Crazes of Fear and sickening Want, and huge"
829,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Injurious Darkness, lord of the bad wings"
830,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"That pester all the places beyond God,--"
831,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"These at the door, with lust to embody themselves,"
832,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Wait for the naked journey of man's life
833,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"To seize it into ache, ravenously."
834,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"They never leave, down all its patient way,"
835,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"To meddle with its waters, till they be sour"
836,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"As venom, salt as weeping, foully ailing"
837,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"With foreign evil,--all the sort of desires"
838,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Whoring the shuddering life unto their lust.
839,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Behold man's river now; it has travelled far
840,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"From that divine loathing, and it is made"
841,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"One with the two main fiends, the Dark and Cold,"
842,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The faithful lovers of mankind. Behold,"
843,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Broad it is now become, a plenteous water,"
844,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"A roomy tide. And lo, what oars are these?"
845,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"To sweet sung measure rows what happy fleet,"
846,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"With at the lifted prows banners of flame,"
847,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Bravely scaring the darkness to betray
848,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The black embarasst flood sheared by the stems?
849,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Behold, at last God for man's misery"
850,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Hath found excuse! Behold his wretchedness
851,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Gilded at last with beauty pleasant to God!
852,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,No longer a useless grief is man's life now;
853,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"For floating on it, for enjoying it,"
854,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"A state of barges goes, the state of kings."
855,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"They bring a day with them of many lamps,"
856,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And as they move, on the black slabbèd waters"
857,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Red wounds, and green, and golden, do they shoot"
858,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"About them, beautiful cruelty of light;"
859,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And they throw music over the sounding river.
860,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,I too am walking on the sea of man;
861,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,I watch your singing and your lamps row past;
862,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And under me I hear the river speaking,"
863,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The great blind water moaning to itself
864,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,For sorrow it was made. But in your blithe ships
865,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Silverly chained with luxury of tune
866,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Your senses lie, in a delicious gaol"
867,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of harmony, hours of string'd enchantment."
868,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Or if you wake your ears for the river's voice,"
869,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"You hear the chime of fawning lipping water,"
870,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Trodden to chattering falsehood by the keels
871,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of kings' happiness. And what is it to you,"
872,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,When strangely shudders the fabric of your navy
873,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,To feel the thrilling tide beneath it grieving;
874,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Or when its timber drinks the river's mood,"
875,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The mighty mood of man's Despair, which runs"
876,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Like subtle electric blood through all the hulls,"
877,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And tips each masthead with a glimmering candle
878,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Blue pale and flickering like a ghost? For you
879,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Are too much lit to mark a corposant.
880,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Nor yours the stale smell of the unhealthful stream,"
881,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Clotted with mud and sullen with its weeds,"
882,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Who carry your own air with you, blest sweet"
883,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And drencht with many scattered fragrances.
884,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"You, sailing in golden ignorance, know not"
885,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The anxious flow of life under your way:
886,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Do you not miss half the wonder of you?--
887,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,That so your happiness in the thought of God
888,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Stands, that he open'd man's expense of grief"
889,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"To give your oars unscrupulous room, to be"
890,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The buoyancy of your delighted barges,"
891,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Sliding with fortunate lanterns and with tunes
892,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And odorous holiday, O kings, O you"
893,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The pleasure of God, richly, joyously launcht"
894,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"On this kind sea, the tame sorrow of Man?"
895,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,You need poets to reckon your marvellousness----
896,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,
897,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,_Ahasuerus_.
898,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Where is he driving? I set thee not to this;
899,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"It was to tell what I, not what they, be."
900,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,
901,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,_Poet_.
902,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"How can they know what thou art, if not first"
903,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"I tell them what they are themselves, my king?"
904,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,
905,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,_Ahasuerus_.
906,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Thou hast a night, man, not a week to tell them."
907,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"You men of words, dealers in breath, conceit"
908,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Too bravely of yourselves;--O I know why
909,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"You love to make man's life a villainous thing,"
910,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And pose his happiness with heavy words.
911,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,You mean to puff your craft into a likeness
912,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Of what hath been in the great days of the Gods.
913,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"When Tiamat, the old foul worm from hell,"
914,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Lay coiled and nested in the unmade world,"
915,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,All the loose stuff dragg'd with her rummaging tail
916,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And packt about her belly in a form,"
917,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Where she could hutch herself and bark at Heaven,--"
918,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The god's bright soldier, Bel, fashioned a wind;"
919,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And when her jaws began her whining rage
920,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Against him, into her guts he shot the wind"
921,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And rent the membranes of her life. So you
922,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Wordmongers would be Bel to the life of man.
923,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,You like not that his will should heap the world
924,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,About him in a fumbled den of toil;
925,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And set the strength of his spirit, not to joy,"
926,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,But to laborious money; so you stand forth
927,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And think with spoken wind to make such stir
928,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And rumble in the inwards of man's life,"
929,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,That he in a noble colic will leap up
930,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Out of his cave of work and breathe sweet air.
931,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,You will not do it: man prefers his den.
932,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Now leave mankind alone and sing of me.
933,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,
934,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,_Poet_.
935,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,So; I will tell thy glory now aright.
936,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"I will not make it thy chief wonder, King,"
937,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,That thou hast tied the world upon a rack;
938,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Or that thy armies be so huge, the earth"
939,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Sways like a bridge of planks beneath their march,"
940,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And leagues about their way out of the ground
941,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Like thunder comes the rumour of thy vengeance.
942,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,These be but shows of kingship; but one thing
943,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Exclaims, inevitably as a word"
944,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Announced by God, thee first of the world's souls,--"
945,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,That thou mayst have in thy arms Vashti the Queen.--
946,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Princes, what looks are these?"
947,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Why are your minds astonisht so unwisely?
948,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"What, think you war the thing, or pompous fame?"
949,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,See if I speak not truth of love and woman.
950,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"You will have heard how lightning's struck a man,"
951,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Shepherd or wayfarer, and when they found"
952,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The branded corpse, the rayment was torn off,"
953,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Blown into tatters and strewn wide by that
954,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Withering death, and he birth-naked stretcht:"
955,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Bethink you, is not that now very like"
956,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,How woman smites your souls? Whatever dress
957,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of thought you take to royalize your nature,--"
958,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Gorgeous shawls of kingship, a world's fear,"
959,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Or ample weavings of imagination,"
960,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Or the spun light of wisdom,--like a gust"
961,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of flame, that weather of impersonal thought"
962,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"You strut beneath, that hanging storm of Love,"
963,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Strikes down a terrible swift dazzling finger,"
964,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Sight of some woman, on your clothèd hearts,"
965,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And plucks the winding folly off, and leaves"
966,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Bare nature there. And hear another likeness.
967,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Look, if the priests have made an altar-fire,"
968,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"They can have any flame they list, as gums"
969,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Sprinkle the fluel, or salts, or curious earths,--"
970,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Tawny or purple, green, scarlet, or blue,"
971,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Or moted with an upward rain of sparks;
972,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"But first there must be air, or else no fire:"
973,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Man's being is a fire lit unto God,"
974,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And many thoughts colour the sacred flame;
975,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"But the air for him, the draught wherein he glows,"
976,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The breathing spirit that has turned mere life
977,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Into the hot vehement being of man
978,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Lambent upon the altar of the world,"
979,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Is woman and desire of her, nought else."
980,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Behold, we know not what we do at all"
981,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"When we love women: is it we who love,"
982,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Or Destiny rather visiting our souls
983,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"In passion?--How shall I name thee what thou art,"
984,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Woman, thou dream of man's desire that God"
985,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Caught out of man's first sleep and fashioned real?
986,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Deliverance art thou from his own strait thought,"
987,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Wind come from beyond the stars
988,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,To blow away like mist all the disgrace
989,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of reasonable bars,"
990,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The forgery of time and place,"
991,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Whereinto soul was narrowly brought
992,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,When it was gridded close behind
993,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The workings of man's mind.
994,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,But Woman comes to bless
995,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"With an immoderateness,"
996,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"With a divine excess,"
997,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Lust of life and yearn of flesh,"
998,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Till there seems naught hindering our souls:
999,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Else we should crawl along the years
1000,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Labour'd with measurable joys
1001,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"No greater than our life,"
1002,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Things carefully devised against tears;
1003,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And as snails harden their sweat
1004,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"To brittle safety, a carried shell,"
1005,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,So we might build out of our woe of toil
1006,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Serious delight.
1007,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,But to see and hear and touch Woman
1008,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Breaks our shell of this accursed world,"
1009,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And turns our measured days to measureless gleam.
1010,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Up in a sudden burning flares
1011,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The dark tent of nature pitched about our souls;
1012,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"And light, like a stound of golden din,"
1013,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"A shadowless light like weather of infinite plains,"
1014,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Light not narrowed into place,"
1015,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Amazes the naked nerves of the soul;
1016,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And like the pouring of immortal airs
1017,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Out of a flowery season,"
1018,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Over us blows the inordinate desire.--
1019,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Ah, who from Hell did the wisdom bring"
1020,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,That would make life a formal thing?
1021,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Who has invented all the manner and wont,"
1022,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The customary ways,"
1023,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,That harness into evil scales
1024,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Of malady our living?
1025,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,But how they shrivel and craze
1026,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,If love but glance on them!
1027,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And as a bowl of glass to shattering
1028,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Shivers at a sounding string,"
1029,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The brittle glittering self of man
1030,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"At beauty of Woman throbs apieces,"
1031,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And seems into Eternity spilled
1032,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The being it contained.
1033,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Let it touch Woman and flesh becomes
1034,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Finer and more thrilled
1035,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Than air contrived in tune,"
1036,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Lighter round the soul
1037,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Than flame is round burning.
1038,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,She is God's bribery to man
1039,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"That he the world endure,"
1040,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,His wage for carrying the weight of being.
1041,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Nay, she is rather the eternal lure"
1042,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Out of form and things that end,"
1043,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Out of all the starry snares,"
1044,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Out of the trap of years,"
1045,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Into measureless desire;
1046,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Lest man be satisfied with mind,--"
1047,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Be never stung into self-hate
1048,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,At crouching always in the crate
1049,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of prudent knowledge round him wrought,"
1050,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And so grow small as his own thought.
1051,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Kings, think of the woman's body you love best"
1052,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"How the beloved lines twin and merge,"
1053,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Go into rhyme and differ, swerve and kiss,"
1054,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Relent to hollows or like yearning pout,--"
1055,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Curves that come to wondrous doubt
1056,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Or smooth into simplicities;
1057,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Like a skill of married tunes
1058,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Curdled out of the air;
1059,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,How it is all sung delivering magic
1060,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,To your pent hamper'd souls!
1061,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"I tell you, kings, yours are but stammer'd songs"
1062,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"To that enchantment fashion'd for him,"
1063,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"That ceremony of life's powers,"
1064,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The loveliness of Vashti;
1065,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,That unbelievable worship made
1066,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,For King Ahasuerus.
1067,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"He to whom the loveliest she is given,"
1068,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Least is bound to ended things,"
1069,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Belongeth most on earth to Heaven;
1070,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Hath the whitest wind of flame
1071,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"To burn his soul clean of the world,"
1072,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Clean of mortal imaginings,"
1073,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And back to the Beauty whence he came.
1074,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Now you hear the glory of the king of kings,"
1075,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"That he knows Vashti, that he lives"
1076,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,In this pleasure always.
1077,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Ah, could you see her! But perhaps she is"
1078,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Too fearful in her beauty for most men.
1079,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"I think she would dismay you, and unhitch"
1080,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The sinews from their purchase on your bones,"
1081,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And have you spelled as a wizard spells his ghosts.
1082,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Yet 'twould be mercy so to harm your sense.
1083,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"The truth does not more wonderfully walk,"
1084,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Whose gestures are the stars, than in her ways"
1085,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,This queen's body sways.
1086,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And there is such language in her hair
1087,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,As the sun's self doth talk.
1088,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"King, let them see her! lest they return unwise"
1089,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Of thy true kingship, and among themselves"
1090,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Imagine that they are even as thou,"
1091,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Save in the height of throne. Let them perceive
1092,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"That, having Vashti, there is none like thee:"
1093,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Others are men; but thou art he whose spirit
1094,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Is station'd in the beauty of the queen,"
1095,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Whose flesh knows such amazement as before
1096,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Never beneath the lintels of man's sense
1097,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Came, an especial messenger from Heaven."
1098,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,
1099,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,_Ahasuerus_.
1100,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Bring her! let the Queen come crowned before us!
1101,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Slaves, fetch here all your light to shine upon"
1102,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,My Vashti's beauty; let there be clear floor;
1103,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Make the air worthy her with camphire lit
1104,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And frankincense; and fill the hall with flames.
1105,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Then gaze, kings, and stare, hunger with your eyes"
1106,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Upon her face; but within brakes of fear
1107,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Fasten your wills, and move not from your seats."
1108,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Exult, you thron'd nations, that to your sight"
1109,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"She shall be lent, the pleasure of the king,"
1110,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"She whom to visit so inflames my soul,"
1111,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,That I can judge how God burns to enjoy
1112,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,The beauty of the Wisdom that he made
1113,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,And separated from himself to be
1114,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,"Wife to the divine act, mother of heavens.--"
1115,THE FEAST OF KINGS: MIDNIGHT,Let Vashti come and stand before the kings!

1124,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1125,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1126,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And when the King our lord spendeth on us
1127,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"This festival out of his rich heart, to shoot"
1128,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Thy looks upon us as thou wouldst rebuke us?
1129,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1130,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1131,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Your pardon: do I trouble your greed?
1132,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1133,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1134,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Our greed?
1135,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Rather our gratitude----
1136,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1137,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1138,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That we have share
1139,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"In these devices of the King's own cooks,"
1140,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"These costly breads,--"
1141,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1142,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1143,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And these delicious meats,"
1144,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,These sauces mixt of spicy treacle and balm.
1145,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1146,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1147,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And wines, purple and blue and like gold fire,"
1148,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Made of the colours of the morning sea
1149,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And fragrance wild as woman's need of love.
1150,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1151,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1152,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Enjoy them then: who lets you?

1156,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thou sittest with hands folded in thy robe,"
1157,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And in the midst of delicacies wilt fast.
1158,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1159,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1160,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,We see thine eyes upon them as they were
1161,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Wickedness.
1162,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1163,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1164,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,'Tis rare bounty that we women
1165,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Halve with the King his festival.
1166,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1167,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1168,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And thou,"
1169,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"It seems, scarce findest it thankworthy."
1170,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1171,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1172,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Again,"
1173,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Your pardon: but ye need not gaze on me.--
1174,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And yet, why am I sorrowful? In truth,"
1175,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Is it a sorrow that so leans upon me?
1176,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I know not. But my soul knoweth right well
1177,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That I am watched.
1178,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1179,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1180,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Then in thy conscience, Queen,"
1181,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Thou feelest the King requiring thanks of thee.
1182,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1183,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1184,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Be careful of thy tongue,--and of the wine.--"
1185,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Who watches me? Eyes are fixt on my soul,"
1186,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Eyes of desire. I think some great event
1187,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Hath pusht its spirit forward of its time,"
1188,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"To stand here quietly waiting, into my mind"
1189,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Inflicting its strange want of me, and ready"
1190,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"To fetch my heart, and ready to take my hand"
1191,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And lead me away shrinking: is it Death?
1192,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,It is some marvellous thing: for I know surely
1193,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Behind it crowd out of their discipline
1194,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The coming hours to watch me seized, and stare"
1195,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"With questioning brows on me, and lift lean hands"
1196,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,From under gowns of shadow to point me out
1197,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"One to another, saying: ""This is she:"
1198,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"How will she bear it, think ye?""--Is it not cold?"
1199,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Was there not wind just then?--The flames are steady.
1200,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1201,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1202,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,No wind at all: the air's like one closed room.
1203,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1204,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1205,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"There is no talk like this at the King's feast,"
1206,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I warrant. Were we not best be merry,"
1207,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And thank the King so for these wines and sweets?
1208,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1209,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1210,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Yes, let us not forget our thankfulness;"
1211,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"For is not, sisters, everything we have"
1212,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Mere gift?
1213,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1214,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1215,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,My beauty pays for what I get.
1216,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1217,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1218,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I would, 'twere not so."
1219,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1220,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1221,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Queen, I doubt thee not."
1222,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1223,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1224,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Pert little fool, where lies thy beauty, then?"
1225,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thou hast it not: its place is not thy flesh,"
1226,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"But the delighting loins of men, there only."
1227,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Thy beauty! And thou knowest not that man
1228,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Hath forged in his furnace of desire our beauty
1229,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Into that chain of law which binds our lives--
1230,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Man, please thyself, and woman, please thou man."
1231,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"But thou wilt have thy beauty pence, thou sayest?"
1232,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And what's thy purchase? Listen, I will tell thee:"
1233,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Just that thou art not whipt and drudged: the rest,"
1234,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"All that thou hast beyond, is gift."
1235,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1236,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1237,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Why not?
1238,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1239,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1240,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Truly, for thee, why not?"
1241,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1242,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1243,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Wouldst thou, 'twere yours?"
1244,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1245,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1246,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thou shudderest again; what ails thee, Queen?"
1247,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1248,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1249,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I would have lived in beauty once.
1250,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1251,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1252,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,In whose?
1253,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1254,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1255,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I know the King finds relish in thy looks,"
1256,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Wench, and I have no care to grudge thy pride;"
1257,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,But when thy face is named throughout the world
1258,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"For wonder, I will bear thy impudence."
1259,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1260,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1261,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"But tell us, Queen, thy thought; for we have made"
1262,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,An end almost of eating; and it seems
1263,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"It will be somewhat strange, pleasing our mood."
1264,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1265,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1266,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Strange you will find it doubtless; but scarce pleasing,"
1267,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Unless 'tis pleasing to have news of danger.
1268,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Listen! your lives are propt like a rotten house.
1269,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Your souls, that should have noble lodging here,"
1270,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Have crept like peasants into huts that have
1271,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"No force within their walls, but must be shored"
1272,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"With borrowed firmness. Yea, man's stubborn lust"
1273,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"To feed his heart upon your beauty, is all"
1274,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The strength your lives have, all that holdeth you"
1275,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Safe in the world,--propt like a rotten house."
1276,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1277,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1278,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Shall woman then not love to have man's love?
1279,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1280,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1281,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"To feed his heart on us, thou sayest? O yea!"
1282,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And how can a woman know such might of living
1283,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"As when upon her breast she feels the man,"
1284,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The man of her desire, like sacrament"
1285,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Feeding his heart, yea and his soul, on her?"
1286,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1287,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1288,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Are we for nought but so to nourish him?
1289,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1290,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1291,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thou art too proud, O Queen, too proud and lonely,"
1292,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And goest apart to have thy thought too much.
1293,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"'Tis known, too much thought dazes oft a mind,"
1294,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Till it can learn nought of the signèd evil
1295,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"God hath put in the faces of evil notions,"
1296,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That spiritual sight may ken them coming
1297,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Sly and demure, and safely shut the brain"
1298,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Ere they be in and swell themselves to lordship.
1299,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Hence is it that an evil thought in thee
1300,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Hath dared so far, and played its wickedness"
1301,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Strangely within thee, braving even into speech."
1302,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1303,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1304,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Strangely indeed thy brain's inhabited.
1305,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"What, is there aught prosperity for woman"
1306,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,But to be shining in the thought of man?
1307,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1308,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1309,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I wisht to prosper in the life I had,"
1310,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That the Gods might approve the flourishing
1311,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Their heavenly graft of soul took from my flesh.
1312,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Therefore I wisht to love. And I did love.--
1313,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,There came Ahasuerus conquering
1314,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Into my father's land. My fancying hate
1315,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Had made a man-beast of him, a thing, like man,"
1316,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Tall in his walk, but in the mood of his eyes"
1317,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"A beast, and in the noise of his mouth a beast."
1318,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"He came, and lookt at me; and, in a while,"
1319,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I saw that he was speaking to me there.
1320,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And all the maiden went in me before him,"
1321,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Swifter than in a moon which looks against
1322,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The morning, all the silver courage fails.--"
1323,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,How cam'st thou to the King?
1324,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1325,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1326,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Sold to him, I."
1327,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1328,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1329,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Bought by him, I: for he had heard of me."

1331,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1332,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I also, sold or bought; nay, rather paid:"
1333,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Paid like cash to him, that as servant king"
1334,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"My father might have life, and a throne in life."
1335,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,It mattered nothing then.         [_The_ QUEEN _pauses_.
1336,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Often in early summer, as I walkt"
1337,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"A girl singing her happiness, beside"
1338,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The high green corn, holding all earth my own,"
1339,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I saw, as my feet and my voice past by,"
1340,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,How in its hiding some croucht little beast
1341,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Startled, and filled a space of the gentle corn"
1342,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,With plunging quivering fear. And always then
1343,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"My heart answer'd the fear that shook the corn,"
1344,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,With a sudden doubt in its beating; for I knew
1345,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Within my life such rousing of dismay
1346,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I myself should watch, with seizing wonder."
1347,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"It was so: in the midst of my new love,"
1348,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"That promist such a plenty in my soul,"
1349,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"At last some sleeping terror leapt awake,"
1350,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And made the young growth shiver and wry about
1351,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Inwardly tormented. Yea, and my heart"
1352,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"It was, my heart in its hiding of green love,"
1353,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That took so wildly the approaching sound
1354,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Of something strangely fearful walking near.

1356,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1357,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"A queer tale, this."

1360,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,A spectre visited you?

1363,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Indeed, a spectre."

1365,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1366,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That have I never seen.
1367,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Was it the kind with nose and mouth grown sharp
1368,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"To an eagle's bill, and claws upon its fingers,"

1374,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1375,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,It is as I said.

1384,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Loosens the clasp the notion hath digg'd deep
1385,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Into the soul; so that it passeth down,"
1386,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Shaken and mastered, and creeps into the toad,--"

1388,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1389,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Which gives a foolish kick or start to feel it,--"

1391,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_4th Woman_.
1392,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Then the trapt notion may be easily burnt.

1394,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1395,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Yea?--I think mine would not burn easily.
1396,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"With fire, with such indignant fire as pride"

1399,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"With such a fire, whose heat you know not of,"
1400,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Have I assayed this--notion, didst thou say?"
1401,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And it stood upright, with its shape unquencht,"
1402,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And lived within the fire.
1403,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1404,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1405,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Thou hast it wrong.

1408,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Thou hast not understood the cure we meant.

1413,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1414,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I too; I hate a thing I cannot skill;
1415,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And thee and all that lives in thee, O Queen,"
1416,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I would keep friendly to my spirit; yet
1417,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I do suspect something amazing in thee.
1418,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1419,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1420,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And if thou seest not how slippery
1421,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Is women's place in the world of men, 'tis like"
1422,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thou wilt amazedly the vision take,"
1423,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,When I have led thee up my tower of thought.

1426,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"How are we dangerous? Are we not women,"

1429,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1430,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Ay, and therein the danger!"
1431,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Is it not possible he hate the need?
1432,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,For not as he were a beast it urges him:
1433,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"He is aware of it, he knows its force,--"
1434,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The kind of beasts is in their blood alone,"
1435,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"But man is blood and spirit. And in him,"
1436,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"As in all creature, is the word from God,"
1437,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"""Utter thyself in joy."""

1440,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And we his joy.
1441,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1442,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1443,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"But such an one that may become, perhaps,"
1444,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Something not utterance, but strict commanding,"
1445,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Yea, mastery, like the dancing in the blood"
1446,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Of one bitten by spiders. And it is Spirit,"
1447,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Spirit enjoying woman, that hath sent"
1448,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"A beating poison in the blood of man,"
1449,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The poison which is lust. Spirit was given
1450,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,To use life as a sense for ecstasy;
1451,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Life mixt with Spirit must exult beyond
1452,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Sex-madden'd men and sex-serving women,"
1453,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Into some rapture where sweet fleshly love
1454,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Is as the air wherein a music rings.
1455,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,But blood hath captured Spirit; Spirit hath given
1456,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The strength of its desire of joy to make
1457,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"What ecstasy it may of woman's beauty,"
1458,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And of this only, doing no more than train"
1459,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The joys of blood to be more keen and cunning;
1460,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"As men have trained and tamed wild lives of the forests,"
1461,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Breeding them to more excellent shape and size
1462,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And tireless speed, and to know the words of men."
1463,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,So the wise masterful Spirit rules the joys
1464,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That come all fierce from roaming the dark blood;
1465,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"They are broken to his desire, they are wily for him,"
1466,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,A pack of lusts wherewith the Spirit hunts
1467,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Pleasure; and the chief prey the pleasure hid
1468,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,In woman.
1469,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1470,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1471,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,What joys are these?
1472,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1473,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1474,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,What joys?
1475,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The joys of rutting beasts, tamed to endure,"
1476,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Tamed to be always swift to answer Spirit,"
1477,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Yet fiercer for their taming, wilder hungers;"
1478,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"So that the Spirit, if he hunt them not,"
1479,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Fears to be torn by them in mutiny.
1480,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Now know you woman's beauty! 'Tis these joys,"
1481,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The heat of the blood's desires, changed and mastered"
1482,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"By the desire of spirit, trained to serve"
1483,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Spirit with lust, spirit with woman enjoy'd."
1484,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,

1489,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Let it be but the witless mating of beasts,"
1490,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Tamed and curiously knowing itself
1491,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And cunning in its own delight: What then?
1492,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The nightingale desires his little lass,"
1493,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And that brings out of his heart a radiant song;
1494,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"A man desires a woman, and for song"
1495,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Out of his heart comes beauty, that like flame"
1496,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Reaches towards her, and covers her limbs with light."
1497,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"If it so please thee, say that neither loves"
1498,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Aught but his life's desire, fashioning it"
1499,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Adorably to marvellous song and beauty.
1500,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"What then? Enough that the wonder lights on me,"
1501,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,To me is paid the worship of the wonder.
1502,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1503,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1504,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,O well I know how strong we are in man;
1505,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"His senses have our beauty for their god,"
1506,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And his delight is built about us like
1507,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Towering adoration, housing worship.--"
1508,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The spirit of man may dwell in God: the world,"
1509,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,From the soft delicate floor of grass to those
1510,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Rafters of light and hanging cloths of stars,"
1511,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Is but the honour in God's mind for man,"
1512,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Wrought into glorious imagination.
1513,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,But women dwell in man; our temple is
1514,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The honour of man's sensual ecstasy,"
1515,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Our safety the imagined sacredness
1516,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Fashion'd about us, fashion'd of his pleasure."
1517,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Beauty hath done this for us, and so made"
1518,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Woman a kind within the kind of man.
1519,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Yea, there is more than this: a mighty need"
1520,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Hath man made of his woman in the world.
1521,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Now man walks through his fate in fellowship
1522,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Of two companion spirits; ay, and these"
1523,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,With double mastery go on with him.
1524,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The one in black disgraceful weeds is Toil;
1525,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,She sows with never-ending gesture all
1526,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The path before his feet, cursing the way"
1527,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"She drags him on with growth of flouting crops,"
1528,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Urchin thistles, and rank flourishing nettles."
1529,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"But the other has a wear of woven gleam,"
1530,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And with soft hand beseeches him his face
1531,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Away from the hardships of his hurt stung feet,"
1532,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That with his eyes he may desire her looks:
1533,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And she is Beauty of Woman, man's dear blessing."
1534,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And if you would be wise, be well afraid"
1535,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,To think you have more office than to be
1536,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,A sweet delicious while amid man's hours
1537,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Of worldly labour: we are too precious, so."
1538,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Yet see you not how this that Spirit hath done
1539,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Is also dangerous?--For there are mightier needs!
1540,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,There's no content for Spirit in the world
1541,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Till he has striven out of bounded fate,"
1542,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And sent an infinite desire forth
1543,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Into the whole eternity of things.
1544,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Yea, spirit ails with loathing secretly"
1545,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The irremediable force of being;
1546,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Unless, with free expatiate desire,"
1547,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,He shape into the endless burning flux
1548,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Of starry world blindly adventuring
1549,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Some steady righteous destiny for Spirit:
1550,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Even as dreaming brain fashions the fume
1551,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Of life asleep to marshall'd imagery.
1552,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"But we are in the way of this: and man,"
1553,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The more he needs to announce upon the world,"
1554,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Over him going like a storming air,"
1555,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That fashioning word which utters the divine
1556,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Imagination working in him like anger;
1557,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The more he finds his virtue caught and clogged
1558,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,In the fierce luxury he hath made of woman.
1559,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thence are we sin, thence deliciously"
1560,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Persuading man refuse his highest ardour.
1561,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Too easily kindled was the ecstasy
1562,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Of fleshly passion, with a joyous flame"
1563,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Too readily answering the Spirit's fire!
1564,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"He burns with us alone, so fragrantly"
1565,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"His noblest vigour swoons delighted. Yea,"
1566,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Women, I tell you, not far now is man"
1567,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"From hating us, so passionate the joy"
1568,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Of loving us, so mightily drawing down"
1569,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Into the service of his pleasure here
1570,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,All forces of his being. The pleasure soon
1571,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Becomes a shame, scarce to be spoken aloud;"
1572,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And in best minds, either detested doting"
1573,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Man's joy in woman's beauty will become;
1574,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Or a strict binding fire, holding him down"
1575,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,In lust of beauty where no beauty is.

1602,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Tell the King I have hearkened to his message,"
1603,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And tell him I will not come.
1604,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1605,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Messenger_.
1606,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"What sickness shall I say has lighted on thee,"
1607,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,So that thou canst not come?
1608,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1609,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1610,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Thou weariest me.
1611,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Say this to the King, Vashti will not come."
1612,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Are they not plain, my words? Canst thou not learn"
1613,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,them?
1614,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1615,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Messenger_.
1616,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Give me some softer speech. Must I not fear
1617,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I shall earn whipping if I take these words?
1618,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1619,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1620,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I pray thee, go. Thou art a trouble here;"
1621,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Seest thou not how all these feasting women
1622,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Pause, and the pleasure is distrest in them?"
1623,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thou hast thy message: say, She will not come.--"
1624,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Back to the King, now!"
1625,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1626,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Messenger_.
1627,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I am whipt for this.
1628,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1629,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,[_He goes_.
1630,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1631,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1632,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"It seems, my sisters, we have changed our moods."
1633,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"But now, my mind was heavy, you were blithe;"
1634,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And in a moment, you, behold, are fixt"
1635,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Gazing like desperate things, while I rejoice."
1636,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1637,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1638,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Rejoice! thou dost rejoice? then madness does.
1639,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1640,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1641,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I know not that: but certainly I know
1642,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"A mind, that has been feeling for long time"
1643,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The greatness of some hovering event
1644,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Poised over life, will rejoice marvellously"
1645,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"When the event falls, suddenly seizing life:"
1646,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Like faintness when a thunderstorm comes down,"
1647,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"That turns to exulting when the lightning flares,"
1648,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Shattering houses, making men afraid."
1649,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And this is my event: I am its choice.
1650,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Yea, not as a storm, but as an eagle now"
1651,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"It stoops on me; and, though I am its prey,"
1652,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I am lifted by majestic wings, my soul"
1653,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Is clothed in swiftness of a mighty soaring.
1654,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1655,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1656,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,What glory can her wondrous eyes behold?
1657,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1658,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_4th Woman_.
1659,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Seemeth her flesh to glow! and her throat pants
1660,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"As one who feels a god within her, come"
1661,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Out of his heaven to enjoy her.
1662,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1663,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1664,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Ay,"
1665,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Now it is true, the Queen is beautiful;"
1666,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"She could, so looking, enrage love in one"
1667,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Whose blood a hundred years had frozen dry.
1668,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1669,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1670,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Ah, but I fear thee, Queen: this dreadful mood"
1671,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Will break the pleasantness of friendship thou
1672,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Hast kept for me, as a ship in a gale is broken."
1673,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1674,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1675,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Ay, very like: and the event will rouse"
1676,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Such work in the water where your comfort sails,"
1677,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,More than my fortune will to pieces blow;
1678,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,You too I think will get some perilous tossing
1679,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,From what proves my destruction.
1680,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1681,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1682,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And, so knowing,"
1683,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"For mere insane delight in violent things,"
1684,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Wilt thou awake in the fickle mood of men
1685,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Again that ancient ignominy which once,"
1686,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Till beauty freed them, loaded the souls of women?"
1687,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1688,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1689,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Truly, long time will work what now thou doest."
1690,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1691,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1692,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I know not rightly what I here begin;
1693,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"No more than one, who stands in midst of wind"
1694,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"On a tall mountain, knows what breaking down"
1695,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The earth must have ere the wind's speed is done,"
1696,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And it hath drawn out of the drenched soil
1697,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The clinging vapours, and made bright the air."
1698,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1699,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1700,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,But we'll not have thee disobedient.
1701,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The King's mind is a summer over us;
1702,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thou with a storm wilt fill him, and the hail"
1703,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That shatters thee will leave us bruised and weeping.
1704,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1705,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1706,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Be sulky in his arms: the weather soon
1707,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Will pleasantly favour thee again.
1708,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1709,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_4th Woman_.
1710,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"No, no;"
1711,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Not because from our heaven of man's mind
1712,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thou wilt bring down on us a rain of scorn,"
1713,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"But because thou art wicked, thou must go"
1714,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And tell the King the wine was rash in thee.
1715,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1716,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1717,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I must!
1718,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1719,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_3rd Woman_.
1720,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Thou must indeed: words such as thine
1721,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Never were impudent in men's ears before.
1722,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1723,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_2nd Woman_.
1724,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,We will not have thee disobedient.
1725,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1726,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_1st Woman_.
1727,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Here comes another: gentle words, my Queen,"
1728,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Let him take from thee now, and swiftly follow"
1729,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Contrite, and let the beauty of thy grief"
1730,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Bend pleading against the King's furious eyes.
1731,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1732,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"[_The_ POET _comes in, and kneels_."

1734,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Poet_.
1735,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I will not ask thee what strange anger sent
1736,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,That blaze of proud contempt in the King's face:
1737,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,But ere the voice of the King seals up thy life
1738,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"In an unalterable judgment, I"
1739,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Am granted now to come as his last message:
1740,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And, as I will, to speak. Here then I am"
1741,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Not as commanding, but on my knees beseeching,"
1742,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And for myself beseeching.
1743,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1744,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1745,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,What hast thou
1746,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,To do with this? and wherefore wert thou chosen?
1747,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1748,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Poet_.
1749,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I was to praise the splendour of the King;
1750,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And I made thee his splendour; and the King,"
1751,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Knowing my truth, would have thee brought, to break"
1752,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"All the pride of his under-kings, already"
1753,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Desperate with his riches, and now seeing"
1754,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"What marvellous fortune also hath his love,"
1755,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,How marvellously delighted.
1756,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1757,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1758,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Get thee back:
1759,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And tell the King 'tis time his judgment fell.
1760,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1761,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Poet_.
1762,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Not till thou hearest me.
1763,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1764,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1765,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I will not hear thee.
1766,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Wouldst thou go on before me, and say, Look,"
1767,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"This is the woman which I told you of,"
1768,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"You kings; does she not, as I said, stir up"
1769,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Quaking desire through all your muscles? Look,"
1770,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And thank the King for showing you his lust!--
1771,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I will not hear thee.
1772,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1773,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Poet_.
1774,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Dost thou not know, my Queen,"
1775,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"That, when I taught thee songs, thou taughtest me"
1776,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The divine secret, Beauty? My small tunes"
1777,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Were games to thee; but now I am he who knows
1778,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,How man may walk upon Eternity
1779,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Wearing the world as a god wears his power,"
1780,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The world upon him as a burning garment;
1781,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"For I am he whose spirit knoweth beauty,--"
1782,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And thou art the knowledge, Queen! Therefore thou must"
1783,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Come with me to the kings of all the nations;
1784,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"For the whole earth must know of thee. These kings,"
1785,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Though it be but a lightning-moment struck
1786,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Upon the darkness of their ignorant hearts,"
1787,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Must know what I know; that there is a beauty,"
1788,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Only in thee shown forth in bodily sign,"
1789,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Which can of life make such triumphant glee,"
1790,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The force of the world seems but man's spirit utter'd.
1791,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1792,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1793,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And what am I to know?--This must, no doubt,"
1794,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Content me, that we are as wine, and men"
1795,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,By us have senses drunk against his toil
1796,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Of knowing himself, for all his boasting mind,"
1797,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Caught by the quiet purpose of the world,"
1798,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Burnt up by it at last, like something fallen"
1799,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,In molten iron streaming. But I know
1800,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Not drunken may man's soul master his world;
1801,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And I now make for woman a new mood,"
1802,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Wherein she will not bear to know herself
1803,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,A heady drug for man.--I will not come.
1804,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1805,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Poet_.
1806,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"I, who have brought thy insult on the King,"
1807,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Will scarce escape his judgment. But not this
1808,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,My pleading. Seest thou not how wonderfully
1809,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The mean affairs of living fill with gleam,"
1810,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Like pools of water lying in the sun,"
1811,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Because above men's minds renown of thee,"
1812,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"The certain knowledge of beauty, now presides?"
1813,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"It must not be that thou, for a whim of scorn,"
1814,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Wilt let thyself be made unseen, unheard of."
1815,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Beauty is known in thee; but, without thee,"
1816,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,It is a rumour buzzing hardly heard.
1817,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And without beauty men are scurrying ants,"
1818,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Rapid in endless purpose unenjoyed;
1819,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Or newts in holes under the banks of ponds,"
1820,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Feeding and breeding without sound or light.
1821,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,For the one thing that is the god in man
1822,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Is a delight that admirably knows
1823,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Itself delighted; and it is but beauty.
1824,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And thou art beauty known.
1825,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1826,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1827,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Truly, I say,"
1828,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,I know not how to bear it; that for you
1829,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"To feel yourselves, though in the depth of the world,"
1830,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Dizzy, and thence as if elate on high,"
1831,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,We women are devised like drunkenness.
1832,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And what are we to make of ourselves here,"
1833,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,When in the joy of us you think the world
1834,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,No more than your spirits crying out for joy?
1835,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Is this your love, to dream a god of man,"
1836,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And women to keep as wine to make you dream?--
1837,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Now, back! or the eunuchs handle thee."
1838,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1839,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,[_He goes_.
1840,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,
1841,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,_Vashti_.
1842,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"You will not hear of me after this night,"
1843,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And thus I say farewell. It may be, far"
1844,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"In time not yet appointed, our life's spirit"
1845,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Will know its fate, through all the thickets of grief,"
1846,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,As simply and as gladly as one's eyes
1847,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Greet the blue weather shining behind trees.
1848,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Yea, and I think there will be more than this:"
1849,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Is not the world a terrible thing, a vision"
1850,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Of fierce divinity that cares not for us?
1851,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Do we not seem immortal good desire,"
1852,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Mortally wronged by capture in swift being
1853,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Made of a world that holds us firm for ever?
1854,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And yet is it not beautiful, the world?"
1855,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,How read you that? How is our wrong delightful?
1856,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Thus it is: Spirit finding the world fair,"
1857,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Is spirit in dim perception of its own
1858,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Radiant desire piercing the worldly shadow.
1859,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,But what is dim will become glorious clear:
1860,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,All in a splendour will the Spirit at last
1861,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Stand in the world, for all will be naught else"
1862,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,But Spirit's own perfect knowledge of itself;
1863,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Yea, this dark mighty seeming of the world"
1864,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Is but the Spirit's own power unsubdued;
1865,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,And as the unruled vigours of thought in sleep
1866,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Crowd on the brain, and become dream therein;"
1867,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,So the strange outer forces of man's spirit
1868,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Are the appearing world. But all at last,"
1869,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Subdued, becomes self-knowing ecstasy,"
1870,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,The whole world brightens into Spirit's desire.
1871,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,This is for Spirit to be lord of life;
1872,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"And man, with foolish hope looking for this,"
1873,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Takes the ravishing drunkenness he hath

1877,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Over the world, governing it as song"
1878,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Is govern'd by the heart of him who sings;

1887,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Thou art no more a Queen; thou hast no place
1888,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"In the King's house, nor in the life of men:"
1889,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Thus art thou judged. Go forth now; let the night
1890,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,"Befriend thee, for no other friend thou hast,"

1900,VASHTI AND THE KING'S WOMEN AT THEIR FEAST,Yea;

1944,IV,
1945,IV,Into the darkness fared the outcast Queen;
1946,IV,"Fearless her face, and searching with proud gaze"
1947,IV,The impenetrable hour. Behind her burned
1948,IV,"The sky, held by the open kiln of the town"
1949,IV,"In a great breath of fire, yellow and red,"
1950,IV,"From out the festival streets, and myriad links."
1951,IV,"Still might she taste, and still must choke to taste,"
1952,IV,The fragrance of sweet oils and gums aflame
1953,IV,Capturing the cool night with spicy riches;
1954,IV,Still after her through the hollow moveless air
1955,IV,"The sounded ceremonies came, the cry"
1956,IV,"Of dainty lust in winding tune of fifes,"
1957,IV,The silver fury of cymbals clamouring
1958,IV,Like frenzy in a woman-madden'd brain;
1959,IV,"And drumming underneath the whole wild noise,"
1960,IV,"Like monstrous hatred underneath desire,"
1961,IV,The thunder of the beaten serpent-skins.
1962,IV,"Yea, in the town behind her, flaring Shushan,"
1963,IV,"She heard Man, meaning to adore himself,"
1964,IV,"Throned on the wealth of earth as God in heaven,"
1965,IV,"And making music of his glorying thought,"
1966,IV,"Merely betray the mastery of his blood,"
1967,IV,"His sexual heart, his main idolatry,--"
1968,IV,"Woman, and his lust to devour her beauty,"
1969,IV,Himself devoured ceaselessly by her beauty.
1970,IV,"And well she knew, to herself bitterly smiling,"
1971,IV,How the King seated amid his fellow-kings
1972,IV,"Devised his grievous rage, feeling himself"
1973,IV,"Insulted in his dearest mind, his rule"
1974,IV,Over the precious pleasure of his women
1975,IV,Wounded: how the man's wrath would hiss and swell
1976,IV,Like gross spittle spat into red-hot coals.
1977,IV,"But as the Queen fared through the blinded hour,"
1978,IV,Sudden against the darkness of her eyes
1979,IV,"There came a wind of light. Crimson it was,"
1980,IV,"With smokey lightnings braided, in its first"
1981,IV,Swift surge into the gloom before her face;
1982,IV,"But it began to golden, and became"
1983,IV,Astonishingly white. And as she stood
1984,IV,"With rigour in her nerves, a mighty shudder"
1985,IV,"Ravish the light, and in the midst appeared"
1986,IV,"Vision, a goddess, terrible and kind;"
1987,IV,"And to the Queen the goddess spoke, in voice"
1988,IV,That healed her anger with its quietness.
1989,IV,

1991,IV,"I am the goddess Ishtar, and thou art"
1992,IV,My servant. Wilt any of thou help me?
1993,IV,
1994,IV,_Vashti_.
1995,IV,Am I then one whom gods may help? I am
1996,IV,By men judged hateful: surely I am thereby
1997,IV,"Made over to the demons, and not thine."
1998,IV,
1999,IV,_Ishtar_.
2000,IV,"Yet art thou mine, because thou knowest well"
2001,IV,Thou disobeyest me.
2002,IV,
2003,IV,_Vashti_.
2004,IV,How do I so?
2005,IV,
2006,IV,_Ishtar_.
2007,IV,"I am the goddess of the power of women,"
2008,IV,And passion in the hearts of men is my
2009,IV,Divinity.
2010,IV,
2011,IV,_Vashti_.
2012,IV,"Yea, then I disobey thee."
2013,IV,
2014,IV,_Ishtar_.
2015,IV,And yet thou shalt not fear me wronging thee:
2016,IV,"Tell me, O thou Despair, whither thou goest?"
2017,IV,
2018,IV,_Vashti_.
2019,IV,Thy taunt goes past me; I am not despair.
2020,IV,
2021,IV,_Ishtar_.
2022,IV,"Verily, but thou art. Is not thy mind"
2023,IV,A hot revolter from the service due
2024,IV,"To my divinity, passion in men's hearts?"
2025,IV,Is there aught else that thou mayst serve? Thou knowest
2026,IV,There is naught else: therefore thou art Despair.
2027,IV,
2028,IV,_Vashti_.
2029,IV,"That I am infamous, I know. But even now,"
2030,IV,Now when I learn I am to gods no more
2031,IV,"Than to the lust of men, I will not be"
2032,IV,Despair.
2033,IV,
2034,IV,_Ishtar_.
2035,IV,"Who means so greatly to serve pride,"
2036,IV,"That the service of the world is a thing loath'd,"
2037,IV,"Is desperate, avoided by mankind,"
2038,IV,"Unpleasing to the gods. We, who look down,"
2039,IV,Know that the world and pride may both be served.
2040,IV,Yet also that it was too hard for thee
2041,IV,"We know, and pardon. Thou shalt tell me now"
2042,IV,Why thou refusest the life given thee.
2043,IV,
2044,IV,_Vashti_.
2045,IV,"Because I will not, woman should be sin"
2046,IV,Amid man's life. You gods have given man
2047,IV,Desire that too much knows itself; and thence
2048,IV,He is all confounded by the pleasure of us.
2049,IV,How sweetly doth the heart of man begin
2050,IV,"Desiring us, how like music and the green"
2051,IV,First happiness of the year! But this can grow
2052,IV,"To uncontrollably crowding lust, beyond"
2053,IV,"All power of delight to utter, thence"
2054,IV,Inwardly turned to anger and detesting!
2055,IV,"Till, looking on us with strange eyes, man finds"
2056,IV,We are not his desire: it was but sex
2057,IV,"Inflamed, so that it roused the breaking forth"
2058,IV,"Of secret fury in him, consuming life,"
2059,IV,"Yea, even the life that would reach up to know"
2060,IV,The heaven of gods above it.
2061,IV,
2062,IV,_Ishtar_.
2063,IV,"And what, for this,"
2064,IV,Dost thou refuse?
2065,IV,
2066,IV,_Vashti_.
2067,IV,I refuse woman's beauty!
2068,IV,Not merely to be feasting with delight
2069,IV,"Man's senses, I refuse; but even his heart"
2070,IV,I will not serve. Are we to be for ever
2071,IV,"Love's passion in man, and never love itself?"
2072,IV,"Always the instrument, never the music?"
2073,IV,
2074,IV,_Ishtar_.
2075,IV,"I have not done with man.--Thou sayest true,"
2076,IV,Women are as a sin in life: for that
2077,IV,The gods have made mankind in double sex.
2078,IV,Sin of desiring woman is to be
2079,IV,"The knowledgeable light within man's soul,"
2080,IV,Whereby he kills the darken'd ache of being.
2081,IV,But shall I leave him there? or shall I leave
2082,IV,Woman amid these hungers? Nay: I hold
2083,IV,The rages of these fires as a soft clay
2084,IV,Obedient to my handling; there shall be
2085,IV,"Of man desiring, and of woman desired,"
2086,IV,"A single ecstasy divinely formed,"
2087,IV,Two souls knowing themselves as one amazement.
2088,IV,All that thou hatest to arouse in man
2089,IV,Prepareth him for this; and thou thyself
2090,IV,Art by thy very hate prepared: wherefore
2091,IV,"The gods forgive thee, seeing what comes of thee."
2092,IV,Behold now! of my godhead I will make
2093,IV,"Thy senses burn with vision, storying"
2094,IV,The spirit of woman growing from loved to love.
2095,IV,
2096,IV,_The First Vision: Helen_.
2097,IV,"Helen am I, a name astonishing"
2098,IV,"The world, a fame that rings against the sky,"
2099,IV,Like an alarm of brass smitten to sound
2100,IV,The news of war against the stone of mountains.
2101,IV,"I move in power through the minds of men,"
2102,IV,And have no power to hold my power back.
2103,IV,"Men's passions fawn upon my feet, as waves"
2104,IV,That fiercely fawn after the going wind;
2105,IV,"But not as the wind, shaking off the foam"
2106,IV,"Of the pursuing lust of the moaning waves,"
2107,IV,And over the clamour of the evil seas'
2108,IV,"Monstrous word running lightly, unhurt."
2109,IV,"They fawn upon me, all the lusts of the world,"
2110,IV,"Bewildering my steps with straining close,"
2111,IV,And breathe their horrible spittle against me.
2112,IV,Passions cry round me with the yelling cry
2113,IV,Of dogs chained and starving and smelling blood.
2114,IV,"Yea, for through me the world becomes a den"
2115,IV,Of insane greed. In helpless beauty I stand
2116,IV,Alone in the midst of dreadful adoration;
2117,IV,"And, round me thronged, the fawning, fawning lusts"
2118,IV,Open their throats upon me and whine and lick
2119,IV,"My feet with dripping tongues, or gaze to pant"
2120,IV,Hot hunger in my face. For I am made
2121,IV,"To set their hearts grim to possess my life,"
2122,IV,And with an anger of love devour my beauty;
2123,IV,And yet to seal up in their mastered hearts
2124,IV,"The rage, and bring them in croucht worship down"
2125,IV,"Before me, bent with impotent desire."
2126,IV,A quiet place the world was ere I came
2127,IV,"A strife, a dream of fire, into its sleep;"
2128,IV,And with their senses ended men's delights.
2129,IV,But I struck through their senses burning news
2130,IV,"Of impossible endless things, and mixt"
2131,IV,Wild lightning into their room of darkness.--Then
2132,IV,"Agony, and a craving for delight"
2133,IV,"Escaping sensual grasp, began in men;"
2134,IV,And the agony was poison in the health
2135,IV,Of sweet desire.--The joy of me men tried
2136,IV,To compass with strange frenzy and desire
2137,IV,Made new with cunning. But still at my feet
2138,IV,The lusts they tarr on me crouch down and fawn
2139,IV,And snarl to be so fearful of their prey.
2140,IV,I see men's faces grin with helpless lust
2141,IV,About me; crooked hands reach out to please
2142,IV,Their hot nerves with the flower of my skin;
2143,IV,"I see the eyes imagining enjoyment,"
2144,IV,"The arms twitching to seize me, and the minds"
2145,IV,Inflamed like the glee-kindled hearts of fiends.
2146,IV,"And through the world the fawning, fawning lusts"
2147,IV,Hound me with worship of a ravenous yearning:
2148,IV,And I am weary of maddening men with beauty.
2149,IV,
2150,IV,_The Second Vision: Sappho_.
2151,IV,Into how fair a fortune hath man's life
2152,IV,Fallen out of the darkness!--This bright earth
2153,IV,"Maketh my heart to falter; yea, my spirit"
2154,IV,"Bends and bows down in the delight of vision,"
2155,IV,"Caught by the force of beauty, swayed about"
2156,IV,Like seaweed moved by the deep winds of water:
2157,IV,For it is all the news of love to me.
2158,IV,"Through paths pine-fragrant, where the shaded ground"
2159,IV,"Is strewn with fruits of scarlet husk, I come,"
2160,IV,"As if through maidenhood's uncertainty,"
2161,IV,Its darkness coloured with strange untried thoughts;
2162,IV,"Hither I come, here to the flowery peak"
2163,IV,"Of this white cliff, high up in golden air,"
2164,IV,Where glowing earth and sea and divine light
2165,IV,"Are in mine eyes like ardour, and like love"
2166,IV,"Are in my soul: love's glowing gentleness,"
2167,IV,"The sunny grass of meadows and the trees,"
2168,IV,"Towers of dark green flame, and that white town"
2169,IV,"Where from the hearths, a fragrance of burnt wood,"
2170,IV,Blue-purple smoke creeps like a stain of wine
2171,IV,"Along the paved blue sea: yea, all this kindness"
2172,IV,"Lies amid salt immeasurable flowing,"
2173,IV,"The power of the sea, passion of love."
2174,IV,"I, Sappho, have made love the mastery"
2175,IV,Most sacred over man; but I have made it
2176,IV,"A safety of things gloriously known,"
2177,IV,To house his spirit from the darkness blowing
2178,IV,Out of the vast unknown: from me he hath
2179,IV,The wilful mind to make his fortune fair.
2180,IV,"Yea, here I stand for the whole earth to see"
2181,IV,"How life, breathing its fortune like sweet air,"
2182,IV,"Mixing it with the kindled heart of man,"
2183,IV,May utter it proud against the double truth
2184,IV,"Of darkness fronting him and following him,"
2185,IV,"In a prevailing, burning, marvellous lie!"
2186,IV,"And it is love kindles the burning of it,"
2187,IV,"The quivering flame of spoken-forth desire,"
2188,IV,"Which man hath made his place within the world,--"
2189,IV,"Love, learnt of Sappho! and not only bright"
2190,IV,"With gladness: I have devised an endless pain,"
2191,IV,"The fearful spiritual pain of love, to hold"
2192,IV,"In a firm fire, unalterably bright,"
2193,IV,The shining forth of Spirit's imagination
2194,IV,"Declared against the investing dark, a light"
2195,IV,"Of pain and joy, equal for man and woman."

2201,IV,"Thy feet, and the flaming path of thy feet,"
2202,IV,Unto these walls lockt round me like a death.
2203,IV,"Death I would have them till thou comest; yea,"
2204,IV,The earthly stone whereof man's fortune here
2205,IV,"Is made, strongly into deliberate death"
2206,IV,"I have built about my soul, to fend its life"
2207,IV,From gazes of the world. I am too proud
2208,IV,To endure the world's desire of my beauty;
2209,IV,I know myself too marvellous in love
2210,IV,To be the joy of aught that thou hast made:
2211,IV,"I am to be bride of thee, of the world's maker."
2212,IV,"O God, the heart I have from thee, the heart"
2213,IV,"Uttering itself in an endless word of love,"

2217,IV,"Come, wed my spirit; and like as the sea,"
2218,IV,Into the shining spousal ecstasy
2219,IV,"Of sun and wind, riseth in cloudy gleam,"
2220,IV,So let the knowing of my flesh be clouds
2221,IV,"Of fire, mounting up the height of my spirit,"
2222,IV,Fire clouding with flame the marriage hour
2223,IV,Wherein my spirit keeps thy dreadful light
2224,IV,"Away from Heaven in a bridal kiss,--"
2225,IV,Fire of bodily sense in spiritual glee
2226,IV,"Held, as fire of water in sunlit air."
2227,IV,"Ah God, beautiful God, my soul is wild"
2228,IV,"With love of thee. Hitherward turn thy feet,"

2232,IV,Like pure glass smitten by the power of the sun;
2233,IV,"And let them be, in thy descending love,"
2234,IV,"Like glass in a furnace, falling molten down,"
2235,IV,"Back from thy burning feet streaming and flowing,"

2243,IV,Heard by one long closed in the dins of madness.

2251,IV,As music binds into a strict delight
2252,IV,"The manifold random sounds that shake the air,"
2253,IV,Even so fashioned must I have the being
2254,IV,That fills with rushing power the boundless spirit:
2255,IV,"Amidst it, musically firm, a joy"
2256,IV,"That is a fiery knowledge of itself,"
2257,IV,"Thereby self-continent, a globed fire."
2258,IV,"And she who gave thee wonder, is the sign"
2259,IV,"Of those who firmest, brightest hold their being"
2260,IV,Fastened and seized in one enjoyed desire.
2261,IV,Yet even they are but a making ready

2306,I,_A street in Carlisle leading to the Scottish Gate. Three

2309,I,_Katrina_.
2310,I,What a year this has been!
2311,I,
2312,I,_Mary_.
2313,I,There's many a lass
2314,I,"Will blench to hear the date of it--Forty-five,--"
2315,I,"Poor souls! Why will the men be fighting so,"
2316,I,"Running away to find out death, as if"
2317,I,It were some tavern full of light and fiddling?
2318,I,"And when the doors are shut, what of the girls"
2319,I,"Who gave themselves away, and still must live?"
2320,I,Are not men thoughtless?
2321,I,
2322,I,_Katrina_.
2323,I,Leaving only kisses
2324,I,To be remembered by.
2325,I,
2326,I,_Jean_.
2327,I,That's not so bad
2328,I,As when the dead lads went beyond kissing.
2329,I,
2330,I,_Mary_.
2331,I,"Poor souls! Well, Carlisle has at least three hearts"
2332,I,That are not crying for a lad who's gone
2333,I,"Listening to the lean old Crowder, Death."
2334,I,We needn't mope: and yet it's sad.
2335,I,
2336,I,_Jean_.
2337,I,"Come on,"
2338,I,"Why are we dawdling? All the heads are up,"
2339,I,"Steepled on spikes above the Scottish Gate,--"
2340,I,Some of the rebels rarely handsome too.
2341,I,
2342,I,_Mary_.
2343,I,Won't it be rather horrible?
2344,I,
2345,I,_Katrina_.
2346,I,A row
2347,I,Of chopt-off heads sitting on spikes--ugh!
2348,I,
2349,I,_Jean_.
2350,I,"Yes,"
2351,I,And I daresay blood dribbling here and there.
2352,I,
2353,I,_Mary_.
2354,I,"Don't, Jean! I am going back. I was"
2355,I,Forbid the gate.
2356,I,

2366,I,_Jean_.
2367,I,"Yes, come on, Mary."
2368,I,
2369,I,_Mary_.
2370,I,We might just see how horrible they are.
2371,I,
2372,I,_Jean_.
2373,I,"Sure, they will make us shudder;"

2384,I,We aren't your girls.

2387,I,Do you mean the heads upon the Scottish Gate?
2388,I,
2389,I,_Man_.
2390,I,"Ay, that's the show, a pretty one."
2391,I,
2392,I,_Jean_.
2393,I,Are all
2394,I,The rebels' heads set up?
2395,I,
2396,I,_Man_.
2397,I,"All, all; their cause"
2398,I,Is fallen flat; but go you on and see
2399,I,How wonderly their proud heads are elate.
2400,I,
2401,I,_Katrina_.
2402,I,Do any look as if they died afeared?
2403,I,
2404,I,_Man_.
2405,I,Go and learn that yourselves. And when you mark
2406,I,How grimly addled all the daring is
2407,I,"Now in those brains, do as your hearts shall bid you,"
2408,I,"And that is weep, I hope."
2409,I,
2410,I,_Mary_.
2411,I,O let's go back.
2412,I,
2413,I,_Jean_.
2414,I,We have no friends spiked on the Scottish Gate.
2415,I,
2416,I,_Man_.
2417,I,"No? Well, there's quite a quire of voices there,"
2418,I,Blessing the King's just wisdom for his stern
2419,I,Strong policy with the rebels.
2420,I,
2421,I,_Mary_.
2422,I,Who are those?--
2423,I,I think it's fiendish to have killed so many.
2424,I,
2425,I,_Man_.
2426,I,"The chattering birds, my lass, and droning flies:"
2427,I,"They're proper Whigs, are birds and flies,--or else"

2440,I,"Now promise me,"
2441,I,"We'll only take a glimpse, girls, a short glimpse."
2442,I,
2443,I,_Jean (laughing)_.
2444,I,"Yes, just to see how horrible they are."

2454,II,O why did we come here?
2455,II,
2456,II,_Jean_.
2457,II,"One, two, three, four--"
2458,II,A devil's dozen of them at the least.
2459,II,
2460,II,_Katrina_.
2461,II,Poor lads! They did not need to set them up
2462,II,"So high, surely. Which is the one you'ld call"
2463,II,"Prettiest, Jean?"
2464,II,
2465,II,_Jean_.
2466,II,That fellow with the sneer;
2467,II,"The axe's weight could not ruffle his brow,--"
2468,II,How signed it is with scorn!
2469,II,
2470,II,_Katrina_.
2471,II,"Ah yes, he's dark"
2472,II,And you are red: Mary and I will choose
2473,II,"Some golden fellow. Which do you think, Mary?"
2474,II,
2475,II,_Jean_.
2476,II,"O, but mine is the one! Look--do you see?--"
2477,II,He must have put his curls away from the axe;
2478,II,"Or did they part themselves when he knelt down,"
2479,II,And let the stroke have his nape white and bare?
2480,II,O could a girl not nestle snug and happy
2481,II,"Against a neck, with such hair covering her!"
2482,II,
2483,II,_Katrina_.
2484,II,"Now, Mary, we must make our yellow choice;"
2485,II,You've got good eyes; which do you fancy?--Jean!
2486,II,What ails her?
2487,II,
2488,II,_Jean_.
2489,II,How she stares! which is the one
2490,II,"She singles out? That topmost boy it is,--"
2491,II,Pretty enough for a flaxen poll indeed.
2492,II,"Is that your lad, Mary?"
2493,II,
2494,II,_Katrina_.
2495,II,She's ill or fey;
2496,II,They are too much for her; and I truly
2497,II,Am nearly weeping for them and their wives and lasses.
2498,II,Her eyes don't budge! She's fastened on his face
2499,II,With just the look that one would have to greet
2500,II,"The ghost of one's own self. See, all her blood"
2501,II,"Is trapt in her heart,--pale she is as he."
2502,II,
2503,II,_A Man in the Crowd_.
2504,II,Can't you see she's fainting? 'Tis no sight
2505,II,For halfling girls.
2506,II,
2507,II,_Jean_.
2508,II,Halfling yourself.
2509,II,
2510,II,_Katrina_.
2511,II,Mary!
2512,II,
2513,II,_Mary_.
2514,II,"Let us go home now: help me there, Katrina."
2515,II,
2516,II,_Katrina_.
2517,II,"Yes, dear, but are you ill?"
2518,II,
2519,II,_Mary_.
2520,II,No: let us go home.
2521,II,
2522,II,_Katrina (to Jean)_.
2523,II,"Come, Jean. Did you not hear her gasp? We must"
2524,II,Be with her on her way home.
2525,II,
2526,II,_Jean_.
2527,II,You go then.
2528,II,I've not lookt half enough at these. Besides--
2529,II,
2530,II,[MARY _and_ KATRINA _go_.
2531,II,
2532,II,"Well, sir, how dare you speak to girls like that,"

2536,II,You needn't be so short;
2537,II,I guess you're one to take fine care of yourself.
2538,II,
2539,II,_Jean_.
2540,II,"Yes, and I'ld choose a better-looking man"
2541,II,"Than you, my chap, if I wanted company."

2551,II,"O, it's all right."

2560,III,O let me reason it out calmly! Have I
2561,III,"No stars to take me through this terror, poured"
2562,III,"Suddenly, dreadfully, on to my heart and spirit?"
2563,III,"Why is it I, of all the world I only"
2564,III,Who must so love against nature? I knew
2565,III,"Always, that not like harbour for a boat,"
2566,III,"Not a smooth safety, Love would take my soul;"
2567,III,But like going naked and empty-handed
2568,III,"Into the glitter and hiss of a wild sword-play,"
2569,III,"I should fall in love, and in fear and danger:"
2570,III,"But a danger of white light, a fear of sharpness"
2571,III,"Keen and close to my heart, not as it proves,--"
2572,III,My heart hit by a great dull mace of terror!

2575,III,

2577,III,Now I perceive that I was one of those
2578,III,"Who, till love comes, have breath and beating blood"
2579,III,In one continual question. All the beauty
2580,III,My happy senses took till now has been
2581,III,"Drugg'd with a fiery want and discontent,"
2582,III,That settled in my soul and lay there burning.
2583,III,"The hills, wearing their green ample dresses"
2584,III,"Right in the sky's blue courts, with swerving folds"
2585,III,Along the rigour of their stony sinews--
2586,III,"(Often they garr'd my breath catch and stumble),--"
2587,III,"The moon that through white ghost of water went,"
2588,III,"Till she was ring'd about with an amber window,--"
2589,III,The summer stars seen winking through dusk leaves;
2590,III,"All the earth's manners and most loveliness,"
2591,III,"All made my asking spirit stir within me,"
2592,III,"And throb with a question, whose answer is,"
2593,III,"(As now I know, but then I did not know)"
2594,III,There is a Man somewhere meant for me.--
2595,III,And I have seen the face of him for whom
2596,III,My soul was made!
2597,III,"Ah, somewhere? Where is that?"
2598,III,"Have I not dreamt that he is gone away,"
2599,III,Gone ere he loved me? Now I lose myself.
2600,III,I only have seen my boy's murder'd head.

2603,III,
2604,III,"Yes, again light breaks through and quells my thought."
2605,III,"The whole earth seemed as it belonged to me,"
2606,III,A message spoken out in green and blue
2607,III,Specially to my heart; and it would say
2608,III,"That some time, out of the human multitude"
2609,III,"A face would look into my soul, and sign"
2610,III,"All my nature, easily as it were wax,"
2611,III,With its dear image; but after that impress
2612,III,"I would all harden, so that nought could raze"
2613,III,The minting of that seal from off my being.
2614,III,And yesterday it fell. An idle whim
2615,III,"To see the rebels on the Scottish Gate,--"
2616,III,"And there was the face of him I was made to love,"
2617,III,"There,--ah God,--on the gate, my murder'd lad!"
2618,III,Did any girl have first-sight love like this?
2619,III,"Not to have ever seen him, only seen"
2620,III,"Such piteous token that he has been born,"
2621,III,"Lived and grown up to beauty, the man who was meant"
2622,III,"To sleep upon my breast, and dead before"
2623,III,The sweet custom of love could be between us!
2624,III,To have but seen his face?--Is that enough
2625,III,To make me clear he is my man indeed?
2626,III,"Why, sure there are tales bordering on my lot"
2627,III,In misery?--Of hearts who have been stabbed
2628,III,"By knowledge that their mates were in the earth,"
2629,III,Yet never could come near enough to be healed;
2630,III,"Of those who have gone longing all a life,"
2631,III,Because a voice heard singing or a gesture
2632,III,Seen from afar gospell'd them of love;
2633,III,And no more than the mere announcement had.
2634,III,"Ah, but all these to mine were kindly dealing;"
2635,III,For not till they'd trepann'd him out of life
2636,III,"Did he, poor laggard, come to claim my soul.--"
2637,III,"O my love, but your ears played you falsely"
2638,III,When they were taken by Death's wily tunes!

2645,III,"For having that in my ken, I am not far"
2646,III,From loving with my eyes all his body.
2647,III,"What a set would his shoulders have, and neck,"
2648,III,To bear his goodly-purposed head; what gait
2649,III,"And usage of his limbs!--Ah, do you smile?"
2650,III,"Why, even so I knew your smile would be,"
2651,III,Just such an over-brimming of your soul.
2652,III,"O love, love, love, then you have come to me!"
2653,III,"How I have stayed aching for you! Come close,"
2654,III,"Here's where you should have been long time, long time."
2655,III,It is your rightful place. And I had left
2656,III,Thinking you'ld come and kiss me over my heart!

2760,V,"And what good could he do you, if you did?"
2761,V,One loves for kisses and for hugs and the rest;
2762,V,"A spunky fellow,--that's the thing to love."
2763,V,"But a dead man,--pah, what a foolery!"
2764,V,
2765,V,_Katrina_.
2766,V,"O yes, to you; for Love's a game for you."
2767,V,"'Twill turn out dangerous maybe, but still,--a game."
2768,V,
2769,V,_Jean_.
2770,V,"Yes, the best kind of game a girl can play,"
2771,V,"And all the better for the risk, Katrina."
2772,V,But where the fun would be in Love if he
2773,V,"You played with had not heart to jump, nor blood"
2774,V,"To tingle, nothing in him to go wild"
2775,V,"At seeing you betray your love for him,"
2776,V,Beats me to understand. You'ld be as wise
2777,V,Blowing the bellows at a pile of stone
2778,V,As loving one that never lived for you.
2779,V,"It isn't just to make a wind you blow,"
2780,V,But to turn red fire into white quivering heat.
2781,V,"Whatever she's after, 'tis not love, my girl:"
2782,V,I know what love is. But perhaps she saw
2783,V,The poor lad living? Even had speech with him?
2784,V,
2785,V,_Katrina_.
2786,V,Not she; Mary has never known a lad
2787,V,I did not know as well. We've shared our lives
2788,V,"As if we had been sisters, and I'm sure"
2789,V,She's never been in love before.
2790,V,
2791,V,_Jean_.
2792,V,Before?
2793,V,Don't talk such sentimental nonsense--
2794,V,
2795,V,_Katrina_.
2796,V,"Why,"
2797,V,"If Love-at-first-sight can mean anything,"
2798,V,Surely 'tis this: there's some one in the world
2799,V,"Whom, if you come across him, you must love,"
2800,V,And you could no more pass his face unmoved
2801,V,"Than the year could go backwards. Well, suppose"
2802,V,"He dies just ere you meet him; and he dead,"
2803,V,"Ay, or his head alone, is given your eyes,"
2804,V,"It is enough: he is the man for you,"
2805,V,All as if he were quick and signalling
2806,V,His heart to you in smiles.
2807,V,
2808,V,_Jean_.
2809,V,"Believe me, dear,"
2810,V,You've no more notion of the thing called Love
2811,V,"Than a grig has of talking. But I have,"
2812,V,And I'm off now to practise with my notions.
2813,V,
2814,V,_Katrina_.
2815,V,"Now which is the real love,--hers or Mary's?"
2816,V,

2818,VI,VI
2819,VI,
2820,VI,"_Before Dawn, At the Scottish Gate_."
2821,VI,
2822,VI,_Mary_.
2823,VI,"Beloved, beloved!--O forgive me"
2824,VI,"That all these days questioning I have been,"
2825,VI,"Struggled with doubts. Your power over me,"
2826,VI,"That here slipt through the nets death caught you in,"
2827,VI,Lighted on me so greatly that my heart
2828,VI,Could scarcely carry the amazement. Now
2829,VI,I am awake and seeing; and I come
2830,VI,To save you from this post of ignominy.
2831,VI,A ladder I have filched and thro' the streets
2832,VI,"Borne it, on shoulders little used to weight."
2833,VI,You'll say that I should not have bruised myself?--
2834,VI,"But it is good, and an ease for me, to have"
2835,VI,Some ache of body.--Now if there's any chink
2836,VI,"In death, surely my love will reach to thee,"
2837,VI,Surely thou wilt be ware of how I go
2838,VI,Henceforth through life utterly thine. And yet
2839,VI,"Pardon what now I say, for I must say it."
2840,VI,"I cannot thank thee, my dear murder'd lad,"
2841,VI,For mastering me so. What other girls
2842,VI,"Might say in blessing on their sweethearts' heads,"
2843,VI,"How can I say? They are well done to, when"
2844,VI,Love of a man their beings like a loom
2845,VI,"Seizes, and the loose ends of purposes"
2846,VI,Into one beautiful desire weaves.
2847,VI,But love has not so done to me: I was
2848,VI,"A nature clean as water from the hills,"
2849,VI,One that had pleased the lips of God; and now
2850,VI,"Brackish I am, as if some vagrom malice"
2851,VI,Had trampled up the springs and made them run
2852,VI,Channelling ancient secrecies of salt.
2853,VI,"O me, what, has my tongue these bitter words"
2854,VI,"In front of my love's death? Look down, sweetheart,"
2855,VI,From the height of thy sacred ignominy
2856,VI,"And see my shame. Nay, I will come up to thee"
2857,VI,"And have my pardon from thy lips, and do"
2858,VI,"The only good I can to thee, sweetheart."
2859,VI,
2860,VI,*       *       *       *       *
2861,VI,
2862,VI,I have done it: but how have I done it?
2863,VI,And what's this horrible thing to do with me?
2864,VI,"How came it on the ground, here at my feet?"
2865,VI,O I had better have shirkt it altogether!
2866,VI,What do I love? Not this; this is only
2867,VI,"A message that he left on earth for me,"
2868,VI,"Signed by his spirit, that he had to go"
2869,VI,Upon affairs more worthy than my love.
2870,VI,We women must give place in our men's thoughts
2871,VI,To matters such as those.
2872,VI,"God, God, why must I love him? Why"
2873,VI,Must life be all one scope for the hawking wings
2874,VI,"Of Love, that none the mischief can escape?--"
2875,VI,"Well, I am thine for always now, my love,"
2876,VI,"For this has been our wedding. No one else,"
2877,VI,"Since thee I have had claspt unto my breast,"
2878,VI,May touch me lovingly.--
2879,VI,"Light, it is light!"
2880,VI,"What shall I do with it, now I have got it?"
2881,VI,"O merciful God, must I handle it"
2882,VI,Again? I dare not; what is it to me?
2883,VI,Let me off this! Who is it clutches me
2884,VI,By the neck behind? Who has hold of me
2885,VI,"Forcing me stoop down? Love, is it thou?"
2886,VI,"Spare me this service, thou who hast all else"
2887,VI,Of my maimed life: why wilt thou be cruel?
2888,VI,"O grip me not so fiercely. Love! Ah no,"
2889,VI,I will not: 'tis abominable--

2903,I,"Come, why so moody, Morris? Either talk,"
2904,I,"Or drink, at least."
2905,I,
2906,I,_Morris_.
2907,I,I'm wondering about Love.
2908,I,
2909,I,_Hamish_.
2910,I,"Ho, are you there, my boy? Who may it be?"
2911,I,
2912,I,_Morris_.
2913,I,I'm not in love; but altogether posed
2914,I,I am by lovers.
2915,I,
2916,I,_Hamish_.
2917,I,They're a simple folk:
2918,I,I'm one.
2919,I,
2920,I,_Morris_.
2921,I,It's you I'm mainly thinking of.
2922,I,
2923,I,_Hamish_.
2924,I,"Why, that's an honour, surely."
2925,I,
2926,I,_Morris_.
2927,I,Now if I loved
2928,I,"The girl you love, your Jean, (look where she goes"
2929,I,"Waiting on drinkers, hearing their loose tongues;"
2930,I,And yet her clean thought takes no more of soil
2931,I,Than white-hot steel laid among dust can take!)--
2932,I,
2933,I,_Hamish_.
2934,I,"You not in love, and talking this fine stuff?"
2935,I,
2936,I,_Morris_.
2937,I,"I say, if I loved Jean, I'ld do without"
2938,I,"All these vile pleasures of the flesh, your mind"
2939,I,Seems running on for ever: I would think
2940,I,A thought that was always tasting them would make
2941,I,"The fire a foul thing in me, as the flame"
2942,I,"Of burning wood, which has a rare sweet smell,"
2943,I,Is turned to bitter stink when it scorches flesh.
2944,I,
2945,I,_Hamish_.
2946,I,Why specially Jean?
2947,I,
2948,I,_Morris_.
2949,I,Why Jean? The girl's all spirit!
2950,I,
2951,I,_Hamish_.
2952,I,"She's a lithe burd, it's true; that, I suppose,"
2953,I,"Is why you think her made of spirit,--unless"
2954,I,You've seen her angry: she has a blazing temper.--
2955,I,"But what's a girl's beauty meant for, but to rouse"
2956,I,"Lust in a man? And where's the harm in that,--"
2957,I,"In loving her because she's beautiful,"
2958,I,And in the way that drives me?--I dare say
2959,I,My spirit loves her too. But if it does
2960,I,I don't know what it loves.
2961,I,
2962,I,_Morris_.
2963,I,"Why, man, her beauty"
2964,I,Is but the visible manners of her spirit;
2965,I,And this you go to love by the filthy road
2966,I,Which all the paws and hoofs in the world tread too!
2967,I,God! And it's Jean whose lover runs with the herd
2968,I,"Of grunting, howling, barking lovers,--Jean!--"
2969,I,
2970,I,_Hamish_.
2971,I,"O spirit, spirit, spirit! What is spirit?"
2972,I,"I know I've got a body, and it loves:"
2973,I,"But who can tell me what my spirit's doing,"
2974,I,Or even if I have one?
2975,I,
2976,I,_Morris_.
2977,I,"Well, it's strange,"
2978,I,"My God, it's strange. A girl goes through the world"
2979,I,"Like a white sail over the sea, a being"
2980,I,Woven so fine and lissom that her life
2981,I,"Is but the urging spirit on its journey,"
2982,I,And held by her in shape and attitude.
2983,I,And all she's here for is that you may clutch
2984,I,Her spirit in the love of a mating beast!
2985,I,
2986,I,_Hamish_.
2987,I,"Why, she has fifty lovers if she has one,"
2988,I,And fifty's few for her.
2989,I,
2990,I,_Morris_.
2991,I,I'm going out.
2992,I,"If the night does me good, I'll come back here"
2993,I,"Maybe, and walk home with you."
2994,I,
2995,I,_Hamish_.
2996,I,O don't bother.
2997,I,"If I want spirit, it will be for drinking."
2998,I,[MORRIS _goes out_.
2999,I,"Spirit or no, drinking's better than talking."
3000,I,Who was the sickly fellow to invent
3001,I,"That crazy notion spirit, now, I wonder?"
3002,I,But who'd have thought a burly lout like Morris
3003,I,Would join the brabble? Sure he'll have in him
3004,I,A pint more blood than I have; and he's all
3005,I,"For loving girls with words, three yards away!"
3006,I,

3027,I,
3028,I,_Jean_.
3029,I,"Now don't begin to pity yourself, please."
3030,I,
3031,I,_Hamish_.
3032,I,"Ah, I am learning now; it's truth they talk."
3033,I,You would undo the skill of a spider's web
3034,I,"And take the inches of it in one line,"
3035,I,More easily than know a woman's thought.
3036,I,I'm ugly on a sudden?
3037,I,
3038,I,_Jean_.
3039,I,The queer thing
3040,I,About you men is that you will have women
3041,I,Love in the way you do. But now learn this;
3042,I,We don't love fellows for their skins; we want
3043,I,Something to wonder at in the way they love.
3044,I,"A chap may be as rough as brick, if you like,"
3045,I,"Yes, or a mannikin and grow a tail,--"
3046,I,If he's the spunk in him to love a girl
3047,I,"Mainly and heartily, he's the man for her.--"
3048,I,"My soul, I've done with all you pretty men;"
3049,I,I want to stand in a thing as big as a wind;
3050,I,And I can only get your paper fans!
3051,I,
3052,I,_Hamish_.
3053,I,You've done with me? You wicked Jean! You'll dare
3054,I,"To throw me off like this? After you've made,"
3055,I,"O, made my whole heart love you?"
3056,I,
3057,I,_Jean_.
3058,I,You are no good.
3059,I,"Your friend, now, seems a likely man; but you?--"
3060,I,I thought you were a torch; and you're a squib.
3061,I,
3062,I,_Hamish_.
3063,I,"Not love you enough? Death, I'll show you then."
3064,I,
3065,I,_Jean_.
3066,I,"Hands off, Hamish. There's smoke in you, I know,"
3067,I,"And splutter too. Hands off, I say."

3076,I,"Let go, or I'll bite; I mean it. You young fool,"
3077,I,I'm not for you. Take off your hands. O help!
3078,I,[MORRIS _has come in unseen and rushes forward_.

3081,I,"You beast! You filthy villainous fellow!--Now,"
3082,I,I hope I've hurt the hellish brain in you.
3083,I,Take yourself off. You'll need a nurse to-night.
3084,I,[HAMISH _slinks out_.
3085,I,Poor girl! And are you sprained at all? That ruffian!

3088,I,"O sir, how can I thank you? You don't know"
3089,I,What we poor serving girls must put up with.
3090,I,"We don't hear many voices like yours, sir."
3091,I,"They think, because we serve, we've no more right"
3092,I,To feelings than their cattle. O forgive me
3093,I,Talking to you. You don't come often here.
3094,I,

3096,I,"No, but I will: after to-night I'll see"
3097,I,"You take no harm. And as for him, I'll smash him."

3124,II,That was a wonderful look he had in his eyes:
3125,II,"'Tis a heart, I believe, that will burn marvellously!"
3126,II,Now what a thing it is to be a girl!
3127,II,Who'ld be a man? Who'ld be fuel for fire
3128,II,And not the quickening touch that sets it flaming?--
3129,II,'Tis true that when we've set him well alight

3134,II,"O, he caught bravely. Now there's nothing at all"
3135,II,"So rare, such a wild adventure of glee,"
3136,II,As watching love for you in a man beginning;--
3137,II,To see the sight of you pour into his senses
3138,II,"Like brandy gulpt down by a frozen man,"
3139,II,A thing that runs scalding about his blood;
3140,II,To see him holding himself firm against
3141,II,The sudden strength of wildness beating in him!
3142,II,"O what my life is waiting for, at last"
3143,II,"Is started, I believe: I've turned a man"

3161,III,Truly I knew not what a turmoil life
3162,III,"Has been, and how rebellious, till this peace"
3163,III,"Came shining down! And yet I have seen things,"
3164,III,"And heard things, that were strangely meaning this,--"
3165,III,Telling me strangely that life can be all
3166,III,"One power undisturbed, one perfect honour,--"
3167,III,"Waters at noonday sounding among hills,"
3168,III,Or moonlight lost among vast curds of cloud;--
3169,III,But never knew I it is only Love

3226,IV,_Morris_.
3227,IV,My word?--to see
3228,IV,Hamish does nothing to you?
3229,IV,
3230,IV,_Jean_.
3231,IV,The fiend take Hamish!
3232,IV,Do you think I'ld be afraid of him?--It's you
3233,IV,"I ought to be afraid of, were I wise."
3234,IV,
3235,IV,_Morris_.
3236,IV,"Good God, she's crying!"
3237,IV,
3238,IV,_Jean_.
3239,IV,Cannot you understand?
3240,IV,
3241,IV,_Morris_.
3242,IV,"O darling, is it so? I prayed for this"
3243,IV,"All night, and yet it's unbelievable."
3244,IV,
3245,IV,_Jean_.
3246,IV,"You too, Morris?"
3247,IV,
3248,IV,_Morris_.
3249,IV,There's nothing living in me
3250,IV,"But love for you, my sweetheart."
3251,IV,
3252,IV,_Jean_.
3253,IV,"And you are mine,"
3254,IV,"My sweetheart!--And now, Morris, now you know"
3255,IV,Why you are the man that ought to frighten me!--
3256,IV,"Morris, I love you so!"
3257,IV,
3258,IV,_Morris_.
3259,IV,"O, but better than this,"
3260,IV,"Jean, you must love me. You must never think"
3261,IV,"I'm like the heartless men you wait on here,"
3262,IV,Whose love is all a hunger that cares naught
3263,IV,How hatefully endured its feasting must be
3264,IV,"By her who fills it, so it be well glutted!"
3265,IV,
3266,IV,_Jean_.
3267,IV,I did not say I was afraid of you;
3268,IV,"But only that, perhaps, I ought to be."
3269,IV,
3270,IV,_Morris_.
3271,IV,"No, no, you never ought. My love is one"
3272,IV,That will not have its passion venturous;
3273,IV,It knows itself too fine a ceremony
3274,IV,To risk its whole perfection even by one
3275,IV,Unruly thought of the luxury in love.
3276,IV,"Nay, rather it is the quietness of power,"
3277,IV,That knows there is no turbulence in life
3278,IV,Dare the least questioning hindrance set against
3279,IV,"The onward of its going,--therefore quiet,"
3280,IV,"All gentle. But strong, Jean, wondrously strong!"
3281,IV,
3282,IV,_Jean_.
3283,IV,"Yes, love is strong. I have well thought of that."
3284,IV,It drops as fiercely down on us as if
3285,IV,We were to be its prey. I've seen a gull
3286,IV,That hovered with beak pointing and eyes fixt
3287,IV,"Where, underneath its swaying flight, some fish"
3288,IV,"Was trifling, fooling in the waves: then, souse!"
3289,IV,And the gull has fed. And love on us has fed.
3290,IV,
3291,IV,_Morris_.
3292,IV,Indeed 'tis a sudden coming; but I grieve
3293,IV,To hear you make of love a cruelty.
3294,IV,"Sweetheart, it shall be nothing cruel to you!"
3295,IV,"You shall not fear, in doing what love bids,"
3296,IV,Ever to know yourself unmaidenly.
3297,IV,For see! here's my first kiss; and all my love
3298,IV,Is signed in it; and it is on your hand.--
3299,IV,Is that a thing to fear?--But it were best
3300,IV,"I go now. This should be a privacy,"
3301,IV,"Not even your lover near, this hour of first"
3302,IV,Strange knowledge that you have accepted love.
3303,IV,"I think you would feel me prying, if I stayed"
3304,IV,While your heart falters into full perceiving
3305,IV,That you are plighted now forever mine.
3306,IV,"God bless you, Jean, my sweetheart.--Not a word?"
3307,IV,But you will thank me soon for leaving you:
3308,IV,'Tis the best courtesy I can do.
3309,IV,[_He goes_.
3310,IV,
3311,IV,_Jean_.
3312,IV,"O, and I thought it was my love at last!"
3313,IV,"I thought, from the look he had last night, I'd found"
3314,IV,"That great, brave, irresistible love!--But this!"
3315,IV,"It's like a man deformed, with half his limbs."
3316,IV,"Am I never to have the love I dream and need,"
3317,IV,"Pouring over me, into me, winds of fire?"
3318,IV,
3319,IV,HAMISH _comes in_.
3320,IV,
3321,IV,_Hamish_.
3322,IV,Well? What's the mood to-night?--The girl's been crying!
3323,IV,This should be something queer.
3324,IV,
3325,IV,_Jean_.
3326,IV,It's you are to blame:
3327,IV,You brought him here!
3328,IV,
3329,IV,_Hamish_.
3330,IV,"It's Morris this time, is it?"
3331,IV,And what has he done?
3332,IV,
3333,IV,_Jean_.
3334,IV,He's insulted me.
3335,IV,And you must never let me see him again.
3336,IV,
3337,IV,_Hamish_.
3338,IV,"Sure I don't want him seeing you. But still,"
3339,IV,If I'm to keep you safe from meeting him--
3340,IV,
3341,IV,_Jean_.
3342,IV,To look in his eyes would mortify my heart!
3343,IV,
3344,IV,_Hamish_.
3345,IV,Then you'ld do right to pay me.
3346,IV,
3347,IV,_Jean_.
3348,IV,What you please.
3349,IV,
3350,IV,_Hamish_.
3351,IV,A kiss?
3352,IV,
3353,IV,_Jean_.
3354,IV,Of course; as many as you like--
3355,IV,And of any sort you like.

3363,I,I
3364,I,
3365,I,"_On the sea-coast. Three young men_, SYLVAN, VALENTINE,"
3366,I,_and_ FRANCIS.
3367,I,
3368,I,_Valentine_.
3369,I,"Well, I suppose you're out of your fear at last,"
3370,I,Sylvan. This land's empty enough; naught here
3371,I,"Feminine but the hens, bitches, and cows."
3372,I,Now we are safe!
3373,I,
3374,I,_Francis_.
3375,I,"Horribly safe; for here,"
3376,I,"If there are wives at all, they are salted so"
3377,I,"They have no meaning for the blood, bent things"
3378,I,Philosophy allows not to be women.
3379,I,
3380,I,_Valentine_.
3381,I,But think of the husbands that must spend their nights
3382,I,Alongside skin like bark. It is the men
3383,I,That have the tragedy in these weather'd lands.
3384,I,
3385,I,_Francis_.
3386,I,"No thought of that! We are monks now. And, indeed,"
3387,I,"This is a cloister that a man could like,"
3388,I,"This blue-aired space of grassy land, that here,"
3389,I,"Just as it touches the sea's bitter mood,"
3390,I,"Is troubled into dunes, as it were thrilled,"
3391,I,Like a calm woman trembling against love.
3392,I,
3393,I,_Sylvan_.
3394,I,"Woman again!--How, knowing you, I failed"
3395,I,"So long to know the truth, I cannot think."
3396,I,
3397,I,_Francis_.
3398,I,And what's the truth?
3399,I,
3400,I,_Sylvan_.
3401,I,Woman and love of her
3402,I,Is as a dragging ivy on the growth
3403,I,"Of that strong tree, man's nature!"
3404,I,
3405,I,_Valentine_.
3406,I,Yes. But now
3407,I,Tell us a simpler sort of truth. Was she---
3408,I,
3409,I,_Sylvan_.
3410,I,She? Who?
3411,I,
3412,I,_Valentine_.
3413,I,"Katrina, of course: who else, when one"
3414,I,Speaks of a she to you?
3415,I,
3416,I,_Sylvan_.
3417,I,And what about her?
3418,I,
3419,I,_Valentine_.
3420,I,"Was she too cruel to you, or too kind?"
3421,I,
3422,I,_Sylvan_.
3423,I,"Ah, there's no hope for men like you; you're sunk"
3424,I,Above your consciences in smothering ponds
3425,I,"Of sweet imagination,--drowned in woman!"
3426,I,
3427,I,_Francis_.
3428,I,Ay? Clarence and the Malmesey over again;
3429,I,'Twas a delightful death.
3430,I,
3431,I,_Valentine_.
3432,I,But you forget.
3433,I,"Sylvan, we've come as your disciples here."
3434,I,
3435,I,_Sylvan_.
3436,I,"Yes, to a land where not the least desire"
3437,I,Need prey upon your mettle. There are hours
3438,I,"A god might gladly take in these basking dunes,--"
3439,I,"Nothing but summer and piping larks, and air"
3440,I,"All a warm breath of honey, and a grass"
3441,I,All flowers--sweet thyme and golden heart's-ease here!
3442,I,"And under scent and song of flowers and birds,"
3443,I,Far inland out of the golden bays the air
3444,I,"Is charged with briny savour, and whispered news"
3445,I,Gentle as whitening oats the breezes stroke.
3446,I,What good is all this health to you? You bring
3447,I,"Your own thoughts with you; and they are vinegar,"
3448,I,Endlessly rusting what should be clear steel.
3449,I,
3450,I,_Francis_.
3451,I,"I do begin to doubt our enterprise,"
3452,I,The grand Escape from Woman. It lookt brave
3453,I,"And nobly hazardous afar off, to cease"
3454,I,"All wenching, whether in deed or word or thought."
3455,I,And yet I fear pride egged us. We had done
3456,I,"Better to be more humble, and bring here"
3457,I,A girl apiece.
3458,I,
3459,I,_Valentine_.
3460,I,"Yes, Sylvan; you must think"
3461,I,The cloister were a thing more comfortable
3462,I,With your Katrina in it?
3463,I,
3464,I,_Sylvan_.
3465,I,My Katrina!
3466,I,"And do you think, supposing I would love,"
3467,I,I'ld bank in such a crazy safe as that
3468,I,"Katrina? One of those soft shy-spoken maids,"
3469,I,Who are only maids through fear? Whose life is all
3470,I,A simpering pretence of modesty?
3471,I,"If it was love I wanted, 'twould not be"
3472,I,"A dish of sweet stewed pears, laced with brandy."
3473,I,But I can do without a woman's kisses.
3474,I,
3475,I,_Valentine_.
3476,I,"Can you?--You know full well, in the truth of your heart,"
3477,I,That there's no man in all the world of men
3478,I,Whose will woman's beauty cannot divide
3479,I,Easily as a sword cuts jetting water.
3480,I,
3481,I,_Sylvan_.
3482,I,"Have you not heard, that even jetting water"
3483,I,"May have such spouting force, that it becomes"
3484,I,"A rod of glittering white iron, and swords"
3485,I,Will beat rebounding on its speed in vain?--
3486,I,Of such a force I mean to have my will.
3487,I,
3488,I,[_He sits and stares moodily out to sea. His companions
3489,I,whisper each other_.
3490,I,
3491,I,_Valentine_.
3492,I,"Here, Francis! Look you yonder. O but this,"
3493,I,This is the joke of the world!
3494,I,
3495,I,_Francis_.
3496,I,Hallo! a girl!
3497,I,"And, by the Lord, Katrina!--But why here?"
3498,I,
3499,I,_Valentine_.
3500,I,"She's followed him, of course; she's heard of this"
3501,I,Mad escapade and followed after him.
3502,I,
3503,I,_Francis_.
3504,I,She has not seen us yet. Now what to do?
3505,I,
3506,I,_Valentine_.
3507,I,"Quick! Where's your handkerchief? Truss his wrists and ankles,"
3508,I,And pull his coat up over his head and leave him!
3509,I,He won't get free of her again; she'll lead
3510,I,His wildness home and keep him tame for ever.
3511,I,Now!
3512,I,
3513,I,"[_They fall on him, bind him, and blindfold him_."
3514,I,
3515,I,_Sylvan_.
3516,I,What are you doing? Whatever are you doing?
3517,I,"Hell burn you, let me go!"
3518,I,
3519,I,_Valentine_.
3520,I,There's worse to come.
3521,I,
3522,I,"[_They make off, and leave_ SYLVAN _shouting_."
3523,I,KATRINA _runs in_.
3524,I,
3525,I,_Katrina_.
3526,I,Dear Heaven! Were they robbers? Have they hurt you?
3527,I,
3528,I,[_She releases him. He stands up_.
3529,I,
3530,I,_Sylvan_.
3531,I,Katrina!
3532,I,
3533,I,_Katrina_.
3534,I,Sylvan!
3535,I,
3536,I,_Sylvan_.
3537,I,How did you plot this?
3538,I,I thought I'd put leagues between you and me.
3539,I,
3540,I,_Katrina_.
3541,I,Why have you come here?
3542,I,
3543,I,_Sylvan_.
3544,I,"To find you, it seems."
3545,I,"But what you're doing here, that I'ld like to know."
3546,I,
3547,I,_Katrina_.
3548,I,I came to see my grandmother: she lives
3549,I,"All by herself, poor grannam, and it's time"
3550,I,"She had some help about the house, and care."
3551,I,
3552,I,_Sylvan_.
3553,I,Let's have a better tale. You followed me.
3554,I,
3555,I,_Katrina_.
3556,I,"Sylvan, how dare you make me out so vile?"
3557,I,
3558,I,_Sylvan_.
3559,I,How dare you mean to make this body of mine
3560,I,A thing with no thought in it but your beauty?
3561,I,
3562,I,_Katrina_.
3563,I,You shall not speak so wickedly. You've had
3564,I,The half of my truth only: here's the whole.
3565,I,It was from you I fled! I hoped to make
3566,I,My grannam's lonely cottage something safe
3567,I,From you and what I hated in you.
3568,I,
3569,I,_Sylvan_.
3570,I,Love?--
3571,I,"Ah, so it's all useless."
3572,I,
3573,I,_Katrina_.
3574,I,I feared to know
3575,I,"You wanted me,--horribly I feared it."
3576,I,And now you've found me out.
3577,I,
3578,I,_Sylvan_.
3579,I,Is this the truth?--
3580,I,"No help for it, then."
3581,I,
3582,I,_Katrina_.
3583,I,"O, I'm a liar to you!"
3584,I,
3585,I,_Sylvan_.
3586,I,Strange how we grudge to be ruled! rather than be
3587,I,"Divinely driven to happiness, we push back"
3588,I,And fiercely try for wilful misery.--
3589,I,"Dearest, forgive me being cruel to you,"
3590,I,You who are in life like a heavenly dream
3591,I,In the evil sleep of a sinner.
3592,I,
3593,I,_Katrina_.
3594,I,"No, you hate me."
3595,I,
3596,I,_Sylvan (kissing her)_.
3597,I,Is this like hatred?
3598,I,
3599,I,_Katrina (in his arms)_.
3600,I,"Sylvan, I have been"
3601,I,So wrencht and fearfully used. It was as if
3602,I,This being that I live in had become
3603,I,"A savage endless water, wild with purpose"
3604,I,To tire me out and drown me.
3605,I,
3606,I,_Sylvan_.
3607,I,"Yes, I know:"
3608,I,"Like swimming against a mighty will, that wears"
3609,I,"The cruelty, the race and scolding spray"
3610,I,Of monstrous passionate water.
3611,I,
3612,I,_Katrina_.
3613,I,"Hold me, Sylvan"
3614,I,I'm bruised with my sore wrestling.
3615,I,
3616,I,_Sylvan_.
3617,I,"Ah, but now"
3618,I,We are not swimmers in this dangerous life.
3619,I,It cannot beat upon our limbs with surf
3620,I,"Of water clencht against us, nor can waves"
3621,I,Now wrangle with our breath. Out of it we
3622,I,Are lifted; and henceforward now we are
3623,I,"Sailors travelling in a lovely ship,"
3624,I,The shining sails of it holding a wind
3625,I,"Immortally pleasant, and the malicious sea"
3626,I,Smoothed by a keel that cannot come to wreck.
3627,I,
3628,I,_Katrina_.
3629,I,"Alas, we must not stay together here."
3630,I,Grannam will come upon us.
3631,I,
3632,I,_Sylvan_.
3633,I,Where is she?
3634,I,
3635,I,_Katrina_.
3636,I,"Yonder, gathering driftwood for her fire."
3637,I,"There is a little bay not far from here,"
3638,I,"The shingle of it a thronging city of flies,"
3639,I,Feeding on the dead weed that mounds the beach;
3640,I,"And the sea hoards there its vain avarice,--"
3641,I,"Old flotsam, and decaying trash of ships."
3642,I,"An arm of reef half locks it in, and holds"
3643,I,"The bottom of the bay deep strewn with seaweed,"
3644,I,A barn full of the harvesting of storms;
3645,I,"And at full tide, the little hampered waves"
3646,I,"Lift up the litter, so that, against the light,"
3647,I,"The yellow kelp and bracken of the sea,"
3648,I,"Held up in ridges of green water, show"
3649,I,Like moss in agates. And there is no place
3650,I,In all the coast for wreckage like this bay;
3651,I,"There often will my grannam be, a sack"
3652,I,"Over her shoulders, turning up the crust"
3653,I,Of sun-dried weed to find her winter's warmth.
3654,I,
3655,I,_Sylvan_.
3656,I,Is that she coming?
3657,I,
3658,I,_Katrina_.
3659,I,"O Sylvan, has she seen us?"
3660,I,
3661,I,_Sylvan_.
3662,I,What matter if she has?
3663,I,
3664,I,_Katrina_.
3665,I,But it would matter!
3666,I,
3667,I,_Sylvan_.
3668,I,"Katrina, come with me now! We'll go together"
3669,I,Back to my house.
3670,I,
3671,I,_Katrina_.
3672,I,"No, no, not now! I must"
3673,I,Carry my grannam's load for her: 'tis heavy.
3674,I,
3675,I,_Sylvan_.
3676,I,We must not part again.
3677,I,
3678,I,_Katrina_.
3679,I,"No, not for long;"
3680,I,"For if we do, there will be storms again,"
3681,I,"I know; and a fierce reluctance--O, a mad"
3682,I,Tormenting thing!--will shake me.
3683,I,
3684,I,_Sylvan_.
3685,I,Then come now!
3686,I,
3687,I,_Katrina_.
3688,I,"Not now, not now! Look how my poor grannam"
3689,I,Shuffles under the weight; she's old for burdens.
3690,I,I must carry her sack for her.
3691,I,
3692,I,_Sylvan_.
3693,I,"Well, to-night!"
3694,I,
3695,I,_Katrina_.
3696,I,To-night?--O Sylvan! dare I?
3697,I,
3698,I,_Sylvan_.
3699,I,"Yes, you dare!"
3700,I,"You will be knowing I'm outside in the darkness,"
3701,I,And you will come down here and give me yourself
3702,I,Wholly and forever.
3703,I,
3704,I,_Katrina_.
3705,I,O not to-night!
3706,I,
3707,I,_Sylvan_.
3708,I,"I shall be here, Katrina, waiting for you."
3709,I,[_He goes_.
3710,I,
3711,I,_The old woman comes in burdened with her sack_.
3712,I,
3713,I,_Grandmother_.
3714,I,"Katrina, that was a young man with you."
3715,I,
3716,I,_Katrina_.
3717,I,"O grannam, you've had luck to-day; but now"
3718,I,It's I must be the porter.
3719,I,
3720,I,_Grandmother (giving up the sack)_.
3721,I,"Ay, you take it."
3722,I,It's sore upon my back. You should have care
3723,I,Of these young fellows; there's a devil in them.
3724,I,Never you talk with a man on the seashore
3725,I,"Or on hill-tops or in woods and suchlike places,"
3726,I,Especially if he's one you think of marrying.
3727,I,
3728,I,_Katrina_.
3729,I,Marrying? I shall never be married!

3733,I,That's nonsense.
3734,I,
3735,I,_Katrina_.
3736,I,I should think 'twas horrible
3737,I,Even to be in love and wanting to give
3738,I,"Yourself to another; but to be married too,"
3739,I,"A man holding the very heart of you,--"
3740,I,
3741,I,_Grandmother_.
3742,I,"He never does, honey, he never does.--"
3743,I,We're late; come along home.
3744,I,
3745,II,II
3746,II,
3747,II,_In_ SYLVAN'S _house_. SYLVAN _and_ KATRINA _talking to
3748,II,each other and betweenwhiles thinking to themselves_.
3749,II,
3750,II,_Sylvan_.
3751,II,How pleasant and beautiful it is to be
3752,II,At last obedient to love! (_To know
3753,II,"Also, I've sold myself,--is that so pleasant_?)"
3754,II,
3755,II,_Katrina_.
3756,II,"I cannot think, why such a glorious wealth"
3757,II,As this of love on our hearts should be spent.
3758,II,"What have we done, that all this gain be ours?"
3759,II,"(_Nor can I think why my life should be mixt,"
3760,II,"Even its dearest secrecy, with another_.)"
3761,II,
3762,II,_Sylvan_.
3763,II,"Ay, there's the marvel! If to enter life"
3764,II,"Needed some courage, 'twere a kind of wages,"
3765,II,As they let sacking soldiers take home loot:
3766,II,But we are shuffled into life like puppets
3767,II,Emptied out of a showman's bag; and then
3768,II,Made spenders of the joys current in heaven!
3769,II,"(_Not such a marvel neither, if this love"
3770,II,Be but the price I'm paid for my free soul.
3771,II,Who's the old trader that has lent this girl
3772,II,The glittering cash of pleasure to pay me with?
3773,II,"Who is it,--the world, or the devil, or God--that wants"
3774,II,To buy me from myself?_)
3775,II,
3776,II,_Katrina_.
3777,II,And then how vain
3778,II,To think we can hold back from being enricht!
3779,II,It is not only offered--
3780,II,
3781,II,_Sylvan_.
3782,II,"No, 'tis a need"
3783,II,As irresistible within our hearts
3784,II,As body's need of breathing. (_That I should be
3785,II,So avaricious of his gleaming price!_)
3786,II,
3787,II,_Katrina_.
3788,II,"And the instant force it has upon us, when"
3789,II,We think to use love as a privilege!
3790,II,"We are like bees that, having fed all day"
3791,II,"On mountain-heather, go to a tumbling stream"
3792,II,To please their little honey-heated thirsts;
3793,II,"And soon as they have toucht the singing relief,"
3794,II,The swiftness of the water seizes them.
3795,II,
3796,II,_Sylvan_.
3797,II,"And onward, sprawling and spinning, they are carried"
3798,II,Down to a drowning pool.
3799,II,
3800,II,_Katrina_.
3801,II,"O Sylvan, drowning?"
3802,II,(_Deeper than drowning! Why should it not be
3803,II,Our hearts need wish only what they delight in_?)
3804,II,
3805,II,_Sylvan_.
3806,II,"Well, altogether gript by the being of love."
3807,II,"(_Yes, now the bargain's done; and I may wear,"
3808,II,"Like a cheated savage, scarlet dyes and strings"
3809,II,"Of beaded glass, all the pleasure of love_!)"
3810,II,
3811,II,_Katrina_.
3812,II,"It is a wonderful tyranny, that life"
3813,II,Has no choice but to be delighted love!
3814,II,(_I know what I must do: I am to abase
3815,II,"My heart utterly, and have nothing in me"
3816,II,That dare take pleasure beyond serving love.
3817,II,Thus only shall I bear it; and perhaps--
3818,II,Might I even of my abasement make
3819,II,"A passion, fearfully enjoying it_?)"
3820,II,
3821,II,_Sylvan_.
3822,II,"You are full of thoughts, sweetheart?"
3823,II,
3824,II,_Katrina_.
3825,II,And so are you:
3826,II,A long while since you kist me! (_What have I said?
3827,II,O fool so to remind him! I shall scarce
3828,II,Help crying out or shuddering this time!--
3829,II,Ah no; I am again a fool! Not thus
3830,II,"I am to do, but in my heart to break"
3831,II,All the reluctance; it must have on me
3832,II,No pleasure; else I am endlessly tortured_.)
3833,II,"Then I must kiss you, Sylvan!"
3834,II,
3835,II,[_She kisses him_.

3837,II,_Sylvan_.
3838,II,"Ah, my darling!"
3839,II,(_God! it went through my flesh as thrilling sound
3840,II,Must shake a fiddle when the strings are snatcht!
3841,II,Will she make the life in me all a slave
3842,II,"Of my kist body,--a trembling, eager slave?"
3843,II,"It ran like a terror to my heart, the sense,"
3844,II,"The shivering delight upon my skin,"
3845,II,"Of her lips touching me_.) My beloved,--"
3846,II,"It may be it were wise, that we took care"
3847,II,Our pleasant love come never in the risk
3848,II,Of being too much known.
3849,II,
3850,II,_Katrina_.
3851,II,O what a risk
3852,II,"To think of here! Love is not common life,"
3853,II,But always fresh and sweet. Can this grow stale?
3854,II,
3855,II,[_She kisses him again_.
3856,II,
3857,II,_Sylvan_.
3858,II,"O never! I meant not so.--Yes, always sweet!"
3859,II,"(_She must not kiss me! Ah, it leaves my heart"
3860,II,"Aghast, and stopt with pain of the joy of her;"
3861,II,And her loved body is like an agony

3958,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Of flies and wasps, to fears and worldly sorrows."
3959,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Nay, they are poured out into the dung of the world,"
3960,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And drench, pollute, the fortune of their state,"
3961,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,When they should have no fortune but themselves

3971,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,CITIZENS _lamenting in the street below_.
3972,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"They have crawled back like beasts dying of thirst,"
3973,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The life all clotted in them. They went out
3974,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Soldiers, and back like beaten dogs they came"
3975,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Breathing in whines, slow maimed four-footed things"
3976,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"On hands and knees degraded, groaning steps."
3977,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Their brains were full of battle, they were made"
3978,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Of virtue, brave men; now in their brains shudder"
3979,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Minds that cringe like children burnt with fever.
3980,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Often they stood to face the enemies' ranks
3981,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"All upright as a flame in windless air,"
3982,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Wearing their arm and the bright skill of swords

3987,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Pain, in the beautiful housing of man's flesh"
3988,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Should sleep, light as a leopard in its hunger,"
3989,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Beside the heavenly soul; and at a wound
3990,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Leap up to mangle her, the senses' guest!--"
3991,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,That in God's country heathen men should do
3992,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,This worse than murder on men full of God!

4096,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Torments him still, like a thirst when fever pours"

4187,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4188,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_A Citizen_.
4189,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,I have no garden where the roses breathe;
4190,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,I have a city full of women crying
4191,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And babies starving and men weak with thirst
4192,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Who fight each other for a dole of water.

4207,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And let the Assyrians end our dreadful lives.
4208,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4209,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4210,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,O I belong to a nation utterly lost!
4211,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,God! thou hast no tribe on the earth; thy folk
4212,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Are helpless in the living places like
4213,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The ghosts that grieve in the winds under the earth.
4214,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Remember now thy glory among the living,"
4215,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And let the beauty of thy renown endure

4221,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The spirit of a people built to God.--
4222,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,So you have given God five days to come
4223,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And help you? You would make your souls as wares
4224,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Merchants hold up to bidders, and say, ""God,"
4225,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Pay us our price of comfort, or we sell"

4229,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_A Citizen_.
4230,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Here comes Ozias: ask him.
4231,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4232,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4233,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Hold him there.
4234,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4235,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,[JUDITH _comes down into the street_.

4239,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4240,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4241,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And I
4242,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Would speak with thee. What tale is this they tell
4243,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,That thou hast sworn to give this people death?
4244,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4245,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4246,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,In five days those among us who still live
4247,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Will have no souls but the fierce anguish of thirst.
4248,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"If God ere then relieves us, well. If not,"
4249,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,We give ourselves away from God to death.
4250,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4251,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4252,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Darest thou do this wickedness, and set"
4253,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Conditions to the mercy of our God?
4254,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4255,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4256,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Death hath a mercy equal unto God's.--
4257,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Look at the air above thee; is there sign
4258,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Of mercy in that naked splendour of fire?
4259,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Too Godlike! We are his: he covers us
4260,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,With golden flame of air and firmament
4261,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Of white-hot gold, marvellous to see."
4262,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"But whom, what heathen land hated of God,"
4263,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Do his grey clouds shadow with comfort of rain?
4264,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Over our chosen heads his glory glows:
4265,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And in five days the torment in his city
4266,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Will be beyond imagining. We will go
4267,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Through swords into the quiet and cloud of death.
4268,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4269,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4270,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Ozias, wilt thou be an infamy?"
4271,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Bethulia fallen, all Judea lies"
4272,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Open to the feet and hoofs of Assyria.
4273,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4274,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4275,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Yea, and what doth Judea but cower down"
4276,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Behind us? There's no rescue comes from there.
4277,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,We are alone with Holofernes' power.
4278,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4279,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4280,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"But if we hold him off, will he not grant"
4281,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"The meed of a brave fight, captivity?--"
4282,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Or we may treat with him, make terms for yielding."
4283,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4284,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4285,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,We know his mind: he hath written it plain
4286,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,In the torn flesh of our ambassadors.
4287,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,His mind to us is death; we can but choose
4288,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Between sharp swords and the slow slaying of thirst.
4289,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4290,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4291,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,He may torment us if we yield.
4292,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4293,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4294,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,He may.
4295,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,But not to yield is grisly and sure torment.
4296,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4297,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4298,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"There must be hope, if we could reckon right!"
4299,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4300,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4301,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Well, thou and God have five days more to build"
4302,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,A bridge of hope over our broken world.
4303,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And, for the town even now fearfully aches"
4304,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"In scalding thirst, not five days had I granted,"
4305,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Had it not been for somewhat I must say
4306,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Secretly to thee.
4307,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4308,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4309,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Secretly? Then here;
4310,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Send off these men to labour at their groans
4311,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Elsewhere; for not within my house thou comest;
4312,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,I'll have no thoughts against God in my house.

4317,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Judith, we are two upright minds in this"
4318,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Herd of grovelling cowardice. We should,"
4319,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,To spiritual vision which can see
4320,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Stature of spirit, seem to stand in our folk"
4321,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Like two unaltered stanchions in the heap
4322,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Of a house pulled down by fire. I know thy soul

4324,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"But not in God, but in mortality"
4325,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Thy soul stands founded; and death even now
4326,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Is digging at thy station in the world;
4327,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And as a man with ropes and windlasses
4328,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Pulls for new building columns of wreckt halls
4329,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Down with a breaking fall, so death has rigged"

4332,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Carved with the beautiful pride of kings, hath made,"
4333,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Hammer'd to rubble and ground for mortar, walls"

4338,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,New flesh and mind for mean souls and dull hearts:
4339,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,For death is only life destroying life
4340,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,To roof the coming swarms in mortal shelter
4341,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Of flesh and mind experienced in joy.
4342,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4343,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4344,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Thy specious prologue means no good, I trow."
4345,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Thou wert to tell me wherefore for five days
4346,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,We may pretend to be God's people still;
4347,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Why thou didst not make us over to death
4348,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Soon as the folk began to wail despair.
4349,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4350,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4351,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"This reasoning will tell thee why.--No need,"
4352,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"I think, to bring up into speech the years"
4353,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Since in the barley-field Manasses lay
4354,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Shot by the sun. I tried (nor failed, I think),"
4355,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"To hold thy soul up from its hurt, and be"

4357,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Blind season of disaster should be changed.
4358,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Always I have found friendship in thine eyes;
4359,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And pleasant words, and silences more pleasant,"
4360,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Have made us moments wherein all the world
4361,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Left our sequester'd minds; so that I dared
4362,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Often believe our friendliness might be
4363,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The brink of love.

4372,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Hath been my life; yea, with it I have kept"
4373,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,My heart drugg'd in a long delicious night
4374,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Colour'd with candles of imagined sense,"
4375,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And musical with dreamt desire. I said,"
4376,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"The day will surely come upon the world,"
4377,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,To scatter this sweet night of fantasy
4378,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"With morning, pour'd on my dream-feasted heart"
4379,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Out of thine eyes, Judith. And yet I still"

4392,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,This life of beautiful passion and sweet sense:
4393,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And now my love comes to thee like an angel
4394,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,To call thee out of thy visionary love
4395,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"For lost Manasses, out of ghostly desire"
4396,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And shadows of dreams housing thy soul, that are"
4397,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Vainer than mine were, dreams of dear things which death"
4398,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Hath for ever broken; and lead thy life
4399,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"To a brief shadowless place, into an hour"
4400,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Made splendid to affront the coming night
4401,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,By passion over sense more grandly burning
4402,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Than purple lightning over golden corn,"
4403,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,When all the distance of the night resounds
4404,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"With the approach of wind and terrible rain,"
4405,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,That march to torment it down to the ground.
4406,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Judith, shall we not thus together make"
4407,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Death admirable, yea, and triumph through"
4408,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The gates of anguish with a prouder song
4409,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Than ever lifted a king's heart, who rode"
4410,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Back from his war, with nations whipt before him,"
4411,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Into trumpeting Nineveh?
4412,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4413,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4414,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Thou fool,"
4415,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Death is nothing to me, and life is all."
4416,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"But what foul wrong have I done to thee, Ozias,"
4417,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,That thou shouldst go about to put such wrong
4418,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Into my life as these defiling words?
4419,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4420,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4421,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Is it defilement to hear love spoken?
4422,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4423,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4424,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Yes! thou hast soiled me: to know my beauty,"
4425,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Wherewith I loved Manasses, and still love,"
4426,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Has all these years dwelt in thy heart a dream
4427,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Of favourite lust,--O this is foul in my mind."
4428,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4429,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4430,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"I meant not what thou callest lust, but love."
4431,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4432,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4433,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,What matters that? Thou hast desired me.
4434,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And knowing that, I feel my beauty clutch"
4435,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,About my soul with a more wicked shame
4436,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Than if I lived corrupt with leprosy.
4437,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4438,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4439,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Wilt thou still let the dead have claim on thee?
4440,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Judith, wilt thou be married to a grave?"
4441,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4442,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4443,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"I am married to my love; and it is vile,"
4444,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Yea, it is burning in me like a sin,"
4445,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"That when my love was absent, thy desire"
4446,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Shouldst trespass where my love is single lord.
4447,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4448,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4449,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,This is but superstition. Love belongs
4450,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,To living souls. It is a light that kills
4451,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Shadows and ghosts haunting about the mind.
4452,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Yea, even now when death glooms so immense"
4453,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Over the heaven of our being, Love"
4454,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Would keep us white with day amid the dark
4455,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Down-coming of the storm, till the end took us."
4456,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And joy is never wasted. If we love,"
4457,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Then although death shall break and bray our flesh,"
4458,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The joy of love that thrilled in it shall fly
4459,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Past his destruction, subtle as fragrance, strong"
4460,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And uncontrollable as fire, to dwell"
4461,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"In the careering onward of man's life,"
4462,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Increasing it with passion and with sweetness.
4463,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Duty is on us therefore that we love
4464,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And be loved. Wert thou made to set alight
4465,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Such splendour of desire in man, and yet,"
4466,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"For a grave's sake, keep all thy beauty null,"
4467,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And nothing be of good nor help to thy kind?
4468,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4469,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4470,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Help? What help in me?
4471,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4472,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4473,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,To let go forth
4474,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The joy whereof thy beauty is the sign
4475,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Into the mind of man, and be therein"
4476,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Courage of golden music and loud light
4477,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Against his enemies, the eternal dark"
4478,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And silence.
4479,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4480,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4481,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Ah, not thus. Yet--could I not help?--"
4482,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Why talk we? What thing should I say to thee
4483,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,To pierce the pride of lust wrapping thy heart?
4484,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"How show thee that, as in maidens unloved"
4485,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,There is virginity to make their sex
4486,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Shrink like a wound from eyes of love untimely,"
4487,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,So in a woman who hath learnt herself
4488,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,By her own beauty sacred in the clasp
4489,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Of him whom her desire hath sacred made,"
4490,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,There is a fiercer and more virgin wrath
4491,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Against all eyes that come desiring her?
4492,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4493,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"[_A Psalm of many voices strikes their ears, and through"
4494,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"the street pass old men chanting, followed and"
4495,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,answered by a troop of young men_.
4496,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4497,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Chorus: Old Men_.
4498,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Wilt thou not examine our hearts, O Lord God of our strength?"
4499,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Wilt thou still be blindly trying us? Wilt thou not at length
4500,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Believe the crying of our words, that never our knees have bent"
4501,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"To foreign gods, nor any Jewish mouth or brain hath sent"
4502,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Prayers to beseech the favour of abominable thrones
4503,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Worshipt by the heathen men with furnaces, wounds, and groans?"
4504,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4505,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Young Men_.
4506,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And what good in our lives, strength or delighted glee,"
4507,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Hath God paid to purchase our purity?
4508,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Though lust starve in our flesh, still he devises fire"
4509,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,To prove our lives pure as his fierce desire.
4510,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"With huge heathenish tribes roaring exultant here,"
4511,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Jewry fights as maid with a ravisher:
4512,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Tribes who better than we deal with the gods their lords,"
4513,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"For they pleasantly sin, yet the gods sharpen and drive their swords."
4514,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4515,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Old Men_.
4516,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Hast thou not tried us enough, Jehovah? Hast thou found any fire"
4517,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Will draw from our hearts a smoke of burn'd idolatrous desire?
4518,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"There is none in us, Lord: no other God in us but thee;"
4519,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Only thy fires make our clean souls glitter with agony.
4520,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Pure we are, pure in our prayers, pure our souls look to thee, Lord;"
4521,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And to be shewn to the world devoured by evil is our reward.
4522,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4523,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Young Men_.
4524,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"We whose hearts were alone giving our God renown,"
4525,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Under the wheels of hell we are fallen down!
4526,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"False the heaven we built, fashion'd of purity;"
4527,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"'Tis heathen heavens, made out of sin, stand high."
4528,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Come, make much of our God! Comfort his ears with song,"
4529,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Lest his pride the gods with their laughter wrong,"
4530,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Seeing, huddled as beasts held by a fearful night"
4531,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Full of lions and hunger, his folk crouch to the heathen might."
4532,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4533,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Old Men_.
4534,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Jehovah, still we refrain from crying to the infamous gates"
4535,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,That open easily into the heavens thy mind of jealousy hates.
4536,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Power is in them: hast thou no power? Wilt thou not beware
4537,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Lest thy mood now press our minds to venturous despair?
4538,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4539,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Young Men_.
4540,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Fool'd, fool'd, fool'd are our lives, held by the world in jeer;"
4541,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,With crazed eyes we behold veils of enormous fear
4542,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Hiding dreadfully those marvellous gates and stairs
4543,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Where the heathen delighted with sin throng with their prosperous prayers.
4544,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4545,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Old Men_.
4546,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Yea, hung like the front of pestilent winds, thunderous dark before"
4547,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"The way into the heathen heavens, terrible curtains pour,"
4548,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Webs of black imagination and woven frenzy of sin;
4549,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And yet we know power on earth belongs to those within.
4550,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4551,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Young Men_.
4552,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Yea, through Jehovah's jealousy,"
4553,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Burning dimly at last we see
4554,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"The great brass made like rigid flame,"
4555,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The gates of the heavens we dare not name.
4556,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Take hold of wickedness! Yea, have heart"
4557,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,To tear the darkness of sin apart;
4558,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And find, beyond, our comforted sight"
4559,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Flash full of a glee of fiery light,--"
4560,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"The gods the heathen know through sin,"
4561,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The gods who give them the world to win!
4562,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4563,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4564,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,This may I not escape. My world hath need
4565,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Of me who still hold God firm in my mind.
4566,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,It is no matter if I fail: I must
4567,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Send the God in me forth, and yield to him"
4568,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The shaping of whatever chance befall.--
4569,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Ozias! hateful thou hast made thyself
4570,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"To me; for thou hast hatefully soiled my beauty,"
4571,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"My preciousest, given me to attire my soul"
4572,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,For her long marriage festival of life.
4573,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Yet I must make request to thee, and thou"
4574,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Must grant it. When the sun is down to-night,"
4575,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Quietly set the main gate open: I
4576,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Will pass therethrough and treat with Holofernes.
4577,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4578,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4579,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"What, wilt thou go to be murdered by these fiends?"
4580,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4581,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4582,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Ask nothing, but do simply my request."
4583,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4584,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Ozias_.
4585,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,I will: so thou shalt know the reverent heart
4586,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"I have for thee, although its worship thou"
4587,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,So bitterly despisest; but thy will
4588,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Shall be a sacred thing for me to serve.
4589,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Thou hast thy dangerous demand, because"
4590,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"It is thou who askest, it is I who may"
4591,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Grant it to thee,--this only! Yea, I will send"
4592,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Thy heedless body among risks that thou,"
4593,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Looking alone at the great shining God
4594,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Within thy mind, seest not; but I see"
4595,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And sicken at them. Yet do I not require
4596,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Thy purpose; whether thy proud heart must have
4597,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The wound of death from steel that has not toucht
4598,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The peevish misery these Jews call blood;
4599,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Whether thy mind is for velvet slavery
4600,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,In the desires of some Assyrian lord--
4601,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Forgive me, Judith! there my love spoke, made"
4602,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Foolish with injury; and I should be
4603,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Unwise to stay here, lest it break the hold"
4604,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"I have it in. I go, and I am humbled."
4605,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,But thou shalt have thy asking: the gate is thine.
4606,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,[_He goes_.
4607,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,
4608,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,_Judith_.
4609,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"How can it harm me more, to feel my beauty"
4610,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Read by man's eyes to mean his lust set forth?
4611,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Yea, Holofernes now can bring no shame"
4612,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Upon me that Ozias hath not brought.
4613,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,But this is chief: what balance can there be
4614,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,In my own hurt against a nation's pining?
4615,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"God hath given me beauty, and I may"
4616,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Snare with it him whose trap now bites my folk.
4617,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,There is naught else to think of. Let me go
4618,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And set those robes in order which best pleased
4619,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Manasses' living eyes; and let me fill
4620,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"My gown with jewels, such as kindle sight,"
4621,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And have some stinging sweetness in my hair.--
4622,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Manasses, my Manasses, lost to me,"
4623,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Gone where my love can nothing search, and hidden"
4624,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Behind the vapours of these worldly years,"
4625,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,The many years between me and thy death;
4626,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Thine ears are sealed with immortal blessedness
4627,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Against our miserable din of living;
4628,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Through thy pure sense goeth no soil of grief.
4629,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Forgive me! for thou hast left me here to be hurt
4630,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And moved to pity by the dolour of men.
4631,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"The garment of my soul is splasht with sorrow,"
4632,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Sorrowful noise and sight; and like to fires
4633,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Of venom spat on me, the sorrow eats"
4634,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Through the thin robe of sense into my soul.
4635,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"And it is cried against me, this keen anguish,"
4636,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,By my own people and my God's;--and thou
4637,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Didst love them. Therefore thou must needs forgive me,"
4638,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"That I devise how this my beauty, this"
4639,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Sacred to thy long-dead joy of desire,"
4640,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,May turn to weapon in the hand of God;
4641,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Such weapon as he hath taken aforetime
4642,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"To sword whole nations at a stroke to their knees,--"
4643,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Storms of the air and hilted fire from heaven,"
4644,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,And sightless edge of pestilence hugely swung
4645,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,Down on the bulk of armies in the night.
4646,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"Such weapon in God's hand, and wielded so,"
4647,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"A woman's beauty may be now, I pray;"
4648,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"A pestilence suddenly in this foreign blood,"
4649,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"A blight on the vast growth of Assyrian weed,"
4650,THE BESIEGED CITY OF BETHULIA,"A knife to the stem of its main root, the heart"

4837,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,Wherein with blinded and unhearing face
4838,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,My hope of thee yet stood and strained to look

4878,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,"Passing, pale and wonderful,"
4879,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,Across the night that filled the pool.
4880,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,And cruel was the grief that played
4881,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,With the queen's spirit; and she said:
4882,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,"""What do I hear, reigning alone?"

4889,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,I burn their brains as I were sign
4890,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,Of God's beautiful anger sent
4891,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,To master them with punishment
4892,IN THE TENT OF HOLOFERNES,Of beauty that must pour distress

5031,IV,"Goes, wild to master the world; and she will"
5032,IV,Therefore be murdered. It is nothing now;
5033,IV,Wind from the heights of death is on my brow.
5034,IV,
5035,IV,_Talk among the other watchers_.
5036,IV,"It must be, God is for us. Such a mind"
5037,IV,"As this of Judith's could not be, unless"
5038,IV,God had spoken it into her. She is
5039,IV,"His special voice, to tell the Assyrians"
5040,IV,Terrible matters.
5041,IV,
5042,IV,Is she God's? I think
5043,IV,'Tis Holofernes hath her now.
5044,IV,
5045,IV,"If not,"
5046,IV,Upon his soldiers he hath lavisht her.
5047,IV,
5048,IV,"Not he. Now they have known her, his filled senses"
5049,IV,Never will leave go our wonderful Judith.
5050,IV,
5051,IV,"Ay, wonderful in Jewry. But there are"
5052,IV,"In Babylon women so beautiful,"
5053,IV,"They make men's spirits desperate, to know"
5054,IV,Flesh cannot ever minister enough
5055,IV,Delight to ease the craving they are taskt with.
5056,IV,
5057,IV,Who talks of Babylon when God even now
5058,IV,"Is training her fierce champion, Holofernes,"
5059,IV,Into the death a woman holds before him?
5060,IV,
5061,IV,A woman killing Holofernes!
5062,IV,
5063,IV,Ay;
5064,IV,"Be she abused by him or not, I know"
5065,IV,God means to give her marvellous hands to-night.
5066,IV,I know it by my heart so strangely sick
5067,IV,With looking out for the first drowsy stir
5068,IV,In that huge flaming quiet of the camp.
5069,IV,Now fearfuller qualm than famine eagerly
5070,IV,"Handles my life and pulls at it,--my faith's"
5071,IV,Hunger for being fed with sounds and visions:
5072,IV,"The firelight mixt with a trooping bustle of shadows,"
5073,IV,"The silence suddenly shouting with surprise,"
5074,IV,That tells of men astounded out of sleep
5075,IV,To find that God hath dreadfully been among them.
5076,IV,
5077,IV,We have mistaken Judith.
5078,IV,
5079,IV,Even as now
5080,IV,God is mistaken by your doubting hearts.
5081,IV,
5082,IV,She that has dealt with such a pride of spirit
5083,IV,"In all her ways of life, so that she seemed"
5084,IV,"To feel like shadow, falling on the light"
5085,IV,"Her own mind made, the common thoughts of men;"
5086,IV,"Ay, she that to-day came down into our woe"
5087,IV,"And stood among the griefs that buzz upon us,"
5088,IV,Like one who is forced aside from a bright journey
5089,IV,"To stoop in a small-room'd cottage, where loud flies"
5090,IV,Pester the inmates and the windows darken;
5091,IV,"This she, this Judith, out of her quiet pride,"
5092,IV,"And out of her guarded purity, to walk"
5093,IV,Where God himself from violent whoredom could
5094,IV,Scarcely preserve her shuddering flesh! and all
5095,IV,"For our sake, for the lives she hath in scorn,"
5096,IV,This horrible Assyrian risk she ventures.
5097,IV,
5098,IV,There should be prayer for that. Let us ask God
5099,IV,"To bind the men, whose greed now glares upon her,"
5100,IV,In some strange feebleness; surely he will;
5101,IV,Surely not with woman's worst injury
5102,IV,Her noble obedience he will reward!
5103,IV,Let us ask God to bind these men before her.
5104,IV,
5105,IV,"They are not his to bind: else, were they here?"
5106,IV,They are the glorying of Nebuchadnezzar's
5107,IV,"Heart of fury against our God, sent here"
5108,IV,Like insolent shouting into his holy quiet.
5109,IV,God could not bind these bragging noises up
5110,IV,"In Nebuchadnezzar's heart; it is not his,"
5111,IV,But made by Babylonian gods or owned
5112,IV,By thrones that hold the heavens over Nineveh.
5113,IV,"For all these outland greatnesses, these kings"
5114,IV,"Whose war goes pealing through the world, these towns"
5115,IV,"Infidel and triumphant, reaching forth"
5116,IV,"Armies to hug the world close to their lust,--"
5117,IV,What are they but the gods making a scorn
5118,IV,Of our God on the earth? Then how can he
5119,IV,Alter these men from wicked delight? or how
5120,IV,"Keep Judith all untoucht among their hands,"
5121,IV,When his own quietness he could not keep
5122,IV,Unbroken by the god's Assyrian insult?
5123,IV,
5124,IV,But with a thunder he can shatter this
5125,IV,"Intruding noise, and make his quiet again."
5126,IV,
5127,IV,"And in their lust he can entangle them,"
5128,IV,"Deceiving them far into Judith's beauty,"
5129,IV,"Which is his power, and lop them from their gods."
5130,IV,
5131,IV,Their outrage will be ornament upon her!
5132,IV,
5133,IV,Out of the hands of the goblins she will come
5134,IV,"Not markt with shame, but wearing their vile usage"
5135,IV,Like one whom earthly reign covers with splendour.
5136,IV,
5137,IV,The ignominy they thought of shall be turned
5138,IV,"To shining, yea, to announcing through the world"
5139,IV,How God hath used her to beguile the heathen.
5140,IV,"It begins! Now it begins! Lo, how dismay"
5141,IV,Is fallen on the camp in a strange wind:
5142,IV,"The ground, that seemed as spread with yellow embers,"
5143,IV,"Leaps into blazing, and like cinders whirled"
5144,IV,"And scattered up among the flames, are black"
5145,IV,Bands of frantic men flickering about!
5146,IV,
5147,IV,Ozias! seest thou how our enemies
5148,IV,Are labouring in amazement? How they run
5149,IV,Flinging fuel to light them against fear?
5150,IV,
5151,IV,Now they begin to roar their terror: now
5152,IV,They wave and beckon wordless desperate things
5153,IV,One to another.
5154,IV,
5155,IV,Hear the iron and brass
5156,IV,"Ringing above their voices, as they snatch"
5157,IV,"The arms that seem to fight among themselves,"
5158,IV,Seized by their masters' anguish; dost thou hear
5159,IV,"The clumsy terror in the camp, the men"
5160,IV,"Hasting to arm themselves against our God,"
5161,IV,Ozias?
5162,IV,
5163,IV,_Ozias_.
5164,IV,Lions have taken a sentinel.
5165,IV,
5166,IV,_A Citizen_.
5167,IV,Judith hath taken Holofernes.
5168,IV,
5169,IV,"_Judith's voice outside, under the gate_."
5170,IV,"Yea,"
5171,IV,And brought him back with her. Open the gates.
5172,IV,
5173,IV,_The Citizens_.
5174,IV,"Open the gates. Bring torches. Wake, ye Jews!"
5175,IV,"Hail, Judith, marvellously chosen woman!"
5176,IV,How bringst thou Holofernes? Show him to us.
5177,IV,
5178,IV,_Judith_.
5179,IV,Dare you indeed behold him?
5180,IV,
5181,IV,_A Citizen_.
5182,IV,Is he bound?
5183,IV,
5184,IV,_Judith_.
5185,IV,"Drugged rather, with a medicine that God"
5186,IV,Prepared for him and gave into my hands.
5187,IV,"Open the gates! It is a harmless thing,"
5188,IV,The Holofernes I have made your show;
5189,IV,You may gaze blithely upon him. I have tamed
5190,IV,The man's pernicious brain. Open the gates!
5191,IV,"What, are your hands still nerveless? But my hands,"
5192,IV,"The hands of a woman, have done notable work."
5193,IV,
5194,IV,"_The Gates open_. JUDITH _appears, standing against"
5195,IV,the night and the Assyrian fires. Torches and
5196,IV,shouting in the town_.
5197,IV,
5198,IV,_Citizens_.
5199,IV,Judith! Judith alone! Where is thy boast
5200,IV,Of Holofernes captured?
5201,IV,
5202,IV,_Judith_.
5203,IV,"I am alone,"
5204,IV,Indeed; and you are many; yet with me
5205,IV,"Comes Holofernes, certainly a captive."
5206,IV,
5207,IV,_Ozias_.
5208,IV,What trifle is this?
5209,IV,
5210,IV,_Judith_.
5211,IV,Trifle? It is the word.
5212,IV,"A trifle, a thing of mere weight, I have brought you"
5213,IV,From the Assyrian camp. My apron here
5214,IV,"Is loaded now more heavily, but as meanly"
5215,IV,"As an old witch's skirt, when she comes home"
5216,IV,From seeking camel's-dung for kindling; yet
5217,IV,"My burden was, an hour ago, the world"
5218,IV,Where you were ground to tortures; it was the brain
5219,IV,Inventing your destruction.--Look you now!
5220,IV,[_Holding up the head of_ HOLOFERNES.
5221,IV,This is the mouth through which commandment came
5222,IV,Of massacre and damnation to the Jews;
5223,IV,Here was the mind the gods that hate our God
5224,IV,Used to empower the agonies they devised
5225,IV,"Against us; here your dangers were all made,"
5226,IV,Your horrible starvation; and the thirst
5227,IV,"Those wicked gods supposed would murder you,"
5228,IV,"Here a creature became, a ravenous creature;"
5229,IV,"Yea, here those mighty vigours lived which took,"
5230,IV,"Like ocean water taking frost, the hate"
5231,IV,"Those gods have for Jehovah, shaping it"
5232,IV,Atrociously into the war that clencht
5233,IV,"Their fury about you, frozen into iron."
5234,IV,"Jews, here is the head of Holofernes: take it"
5235,IV,And let it grin upon our highest wall
5236,IV,Over against the camp of the Assyrians.
5237,IV,[_She throws them the head_.
5238,IV,"Ay, you may worry it; now is the jackals' time;"
5239,IV,"Snarl on your enemy, now he is dead."
5240,IV,
5241,IV,_Ozias_.
5242,IV,"Judith, be not too scornful of their noise."
5243,IV,There are no words may turn this deed to song:
5244,IV,"Praise cannot reach it. Only with such din,"
5245,IV,"Unmeasured yelling exultation, can"
5246,IV,"Astonishment speak of it. In me, just now,"
5247,IV,"Thought was the figure of a god, firm standing,"
5248,IV,A dignity like carved Egyptian stone;
5249,IV,Thou like a blow of fire hast splinter'd it;
5250,IV,"It is abroad like powder in a wind,"
5251,IV,"Or like heapt shingle in a furious tide,"
5252,IV,Thou having roused the ungovernable waters
5253,IV,"My mind is built amidst, a dangerous tower."
5254,IV,"My spirit therein dwelling, so overwhelmed"
5255,IV,"In joy or fear, disturbance without name,"
5256,IV,Out of the rivers it is fallen in
5257,IV,Can snatch no substance it may shape to words
5258,IV,Answerable to thy prowess and thy praise.
5259,IV,"We are all abasht by thee, and only know"
5260,IV,To worship thee with shouts and astounded passion.
5261,IV,
5262,IV,_Judith_.
5263,IV,"Yes, now the world has got a voice against me:"
5264,IV,At last now it may howl a triumph about me.
5265,IV,
5266,IV,_Ozias_.
5267,IV,"This, nevertheless, my thought can seize from out"
5268,IV,"The wildness that goes pouring past it. God,"
5269,IV,"Wondrously having moved thee to this deed,"
5270,IV,Hath shown the Jews a wondrous favouring love.
5271,IV,"Thee it becomes not, standing though thou art"
5272,IV,"On this high action, to think scorn of men"
5273,IV,Whom God thinks worthy of having thee for saviour.
5274,IV,
5275,IV,_Judith_.
5276,IV,This is a subtle flattery. What know I
5277,IV,"Of whom God loves, of whom God hates? I know"
5278,IV,"This only: in my home, in my soul's chamber,"
5279,IV,A filthy verminous beast hath made his lair.
5280,IV,I let him in; I let this grim lust in;
5281,IV,Not only did not bolt my doors against
5282,IV,"His forcing, but even put them wide and watcht"
5283,IV,"Him coming in, to make my house his stable."
5284,IV,"What though I killed him afterward? All my place,"
5285,IV,"And all the air I live in, is foul with him."
5286,IV,"I killed him? Truly, I am mixt with him;"
5287,IV,Death must have me before it hath all him.
5288,IV,
5289,IV,_Ozias_.
5290,IV,"In thee, too, are the floods, the wild rivers,"
5291,IV,"Overrunning thy thought, the nameless mind?"
5292,IV,"How else, indeed? Nay, we are dull with joy:"
5293,IV,"Of thee we thought not, out of the hands of outrage"
5294,IV,"Coming back, although with victory coming."
5295,IV,"But this makes surety once more of my thought,"
5296,IV,And gives again my reason its lost station;
5297,IV,For it may come now in my privilege
5298,IV,(A thing that could cure madness in my brain)
5299,IV,That thou from me persuasion hast to endure
5300,IV,"What well I know thy soul, thy upright soul,"
5301,IV,Feels as abominable harness on it
5302,IV,"Fastening thee unwillingly to crime,--"
5303,IV,The wickedness that hath delighted in thee.
5304,IV,
5305,IV,_Judith_.
5306,IV,"Ay? Art thou there already? Tasting, art thou,"
5307,IV,"What the Assyrians may have forced on me,"
5308,IV,Ere thou hast well swallowed thy new freedom?
5309,IV,"Indeed, I know this is the wine of the feast"
5310,IV,Which I have set for thee and thy Bethulia;
5311,IV,And 'tis the wine makes delicate the banquet.
5312,IV,
5313,IV,_Ozias_.
5314,IV,Wait: listen to me. 'Tis I now must be wise
5315,IV,And thou the hearkener. Not without wound
5316,IV,"(So I make out, at least, thy hurrying words)"
5317,IV,Comest thou back to us from conquering.
5318,IV,"And such a wound, I easily believe,"
5319,IV,As eats into thy soul and rages there;
5320,IV,"Yea, I that know thee, Judith, know thy soul"
5321,IV,Worse rankling hath in it from heathen insult
5322,IV,Than flesh could take from steel bathed in a venom
5323,IV,"Art magic brewed over a charcoal fire,"
5324,IV,Blown into flame by hissing of whipt lizards.
5325,IV,"Yet is it likely, by too much regarding,"
5326,IV,Thy hurt is pamper'd in its poisonous sting.
5327,IV,Wounds in the spirit need no surgery
5328,IV,But a mind strong not to insist on them.
5329,IV,"See, then, thou hast not too much horror of this;"
5330,IV,Who that fights well in battle comes home sound?--
5331,IV,"Much less couldst thou, who must, with seeming weakness,"
5332,IV,Invite the power of Holofernes forth
5333,IV,"Ere striking it, thy womanhood the ambush."
5334,IV,"For thou didst plan, I guess, to duel him"
5335,IV,"In snares, weaving his greed about his limbs,"
5336,IV,Drawn out and twisted winding round his strength
5337,IV,By ministry of thy enticing beauty;
5338,IV,That when he thought himself spending on thee
5339,IV,"Malicious violence, and thou hadst made him"
5340,IV,"Languish, stupid with boasting and delight,"
5341,IV,Thy hands might find him a tied quiet victim
5342,IV,"Under their anger, maiming him of life."
5343,IV,"Now, thy device accomplisht, wilt thou grudge"
5344,IV,Its means? Wilt thou scruple to understand
5345,IV,Thy abus'd sex will show upon thy fame
5346,IV,A nobler colour of glory than a soldier's
5347,IV,Wounded bravery rusting his habergeon?
5348,IV,"Nay, will not the world rejoice, thou being found"
5349,IV,"Among its women, ready such insolence"
5350,IV,"To bear as is unbearable to think on,"
5351,IV,Thereby to serve and save God and his people?
5352,IV,
5353,IV,_Judith_.
5354,IV,"The world rejoice over me? Yea, I am certain."
5355,IV,
5356,IV,_Ozias_.
5357,IV,Then art thou too fastidious. It is weak
5358,IV,To make thyself a shame of being injured;
5359,IV,"And is it injury indeed? Nay, is it"
5360,IV,Anything but a mere opinion hurt?
5361,IV,"Not thou, but customary thought is here"
5362,IV,Molested and annoyed; the only nerve
5363,IV,"Can carry anguish from this to thy soul,"
5364,IV,Is that credulity which ties the mind
5365,IV,Firmly to notional creature as to real.
5366,IV,"Advise thee, then; dark in thyself keep hid"
5367,IV,This grief; and thou wilt shortly find it dying.
5368,IV,
5369,IV,_A Citizen_.
5370,IV,"Judith,"
5371,IV,Pardon our ecstasy. 'Tis time thou hadst
5372,IV,"Our honour. But first tell us all the event,"
5373,IV,That in thy proper height thou with thy deed
5374,IV,May stand against our worship.
5375,IV,
5376,IV,_Judith_.
5377,IV,Why do you stop
5378,IV,"Your shouts, and glare upon me? Have you need"
5379,IV,"Truly to hear my tale? I think, not so."
5380,IV,"Ozias here, as he hath whiled at ease"
5381,IV,"Upon the walls my stay in the camp yonder,"
5382,IV,"Hath fairly fancied all that I have done,"
5383,IV,"And more exactly, and with a relishing gust,"
5384,IV,"All that was done to me. Ask him, therefore;"
5385,IV,If he hath not already entertained
5386,IV,Your tedious leisure with my story told
5387,IV,"Pat to your liking, enjoyed, and glosst with praise.--"
5388,IV,"And yet, why ask him? Why go even so far"
5389,IV,To hear it? Ask but the clever libidinousness
5390,IV,"Dwelling in each of your hearts, and it will surely"
5391,IV,Imagine for you how I trained to my arms
5392,IV,"Lewd Holofernes, and kept him plied with lust,"
5393,IV,"Until his wild blood in the end paused fainting,"
5394,IV,"And he lay twitching, drained of all his wits;--"
5395,IV,"But there was wine as well working in him,"
5396,IV,"Feebling his sinews; 'twas not all my doing,"
5397,IV,"The snoring fit that came before his death,"
5398,IV,The routing beastly slumber that was my time.
5399,IV,You know it all! Why ask me for the tale?
5400,IV,
5401,IV,_Ozias_.
5402,IV,Comfort her: praise her. She is strangely ashamed
5403,IV,Of Holofernes having evilly used her.
5404,IV,
5405,IV,_A Citizen_.
5406,IV,We will contrive the triumph of our joy
5407,IV,"Into some tune of words, and bring thee on,"
5408,IV,"Accompanied by singing, to thy house."
5409,IV,
5410,IV,_Judith_.
5411,IV,"I pray you, rather let me go alone."
5412,IV,You will do better to be searching out
5413,IV,All sharpen'd steel that may take weapon-use.
5414,IV,The Assyrians are afraid: it is your time.
5415,IV,
5416,IV,[_They surround_ JUDITH _and go with her_.
5417,IV,
5418,IV,CHORUS _of Citizens praising_ JUDITH _and
5419,IV,leading her to her house_.
5420,IV,Over us and past us go the years;
5421,IV,Like wind that taketh sound from jubilee
5422,IV,"And aloud flieth ringing,"
5423,IV,"Over us goeth the speed of the years,"
5424,IV,Like loud noise eternally bringing
5425,IV,The greatness women have done.
5426,IV,
5427,IV,Deborah was great; with her singing
5428,IV,She hearten'd the men that the horses had dismayed;
5429,IV,"Deborah, the wife of Lapidoth, alone"
5430,IV,"Stood singing where the men were horribly afraid,"
5431,IV,Singing of God in the midst of fear;
5432,IV,When archers out of Hazor were
5433,IV,"Eating the land like grasshoppers,"
5434,IV,And darkness at noon was plundering the air
5435,IV,"Of the light of the sun's insulted fires,"
5436,IV,Red darkness covering Sisera's host
5437,IV,As Jewry was covered by the Canaanite's boast:
5438,IV,For the earth was broken into dust beneath
5439,IV,"The force of his chariots' thundering tyres,"
5440,IV,Nine hundred chariots of iron.
5441,IV,
5442,IV,Deborah was great in her prophesying;
5443,IV,"But, though her anger moved through the Israelites,"
5444,IV,And the loose tribes her indignant crying
5445,IV,"Bound into song, fashion'd to an army;"
5446,IV,"And before the measure of her song went flying,"
5447,IV,Like leaves and breakage of the woods
5448,IV,"Fallen into pouring floods,"
5449,IV,The iron and the men of Sisera and Jabin;
5450,IV,Not by her alone
5451,IV,God's punishment was done
5452,IV,"On Canaan intending a monstrous crime,"
5453,IV,On the foaming and poison of the serpent in Hazor;
5454,IV,Two women were the power of God that time.
5455,IV,
5456,IV,"Yea, and sullenly down"
5457,IV,"Into its hiding town,"
5458,IV,"Even though the lightning were still in its heart,"
5459,IV,"The broken dragon, drawing in its fury,"
5460,IV,"Had croucht to mend its shatter'd malice,"
5461,IV,Had lifted its head again and spat against God.
5462,IV,"But God its endlessly devising brain,"
5463,IV,"Its braving spirit, its captain Sisera,"
5464,IV,Into the hands of another woman brought:
5465,IV,In nets of her persuasion
5466,IV,"She that wild spirit caught,"
5467,IV,She fasten'd up that uncontrollable thought.
5468,IV,"Sisera spake, and the crops were flames;"
5469,IV,"Sisera lookt, and blood ran down the door-sills."
5470,IV,"But weary, trusting his entertainment,"
5471,IV,"He came to Jael, the Kenite woman;"
5472,IV,"A woman who gave him death for a bed,"
5473,IV,And with base tools nailed down his murderous head
5474,IV,Fast to the earth his rage had fed
5475,IV,With men unreckonably slain.
5476,IV,
5477,IV,"But than these wonderfully greater,"
5478,IV,"Judith, art thou;"
5479,IV,The praise of both shall follow like a shadow
5480,IV,"After thy glory now,"
5481,IV,"Who alone the measureless striding,"
5482,IV,"The high ungovern'd brow,"
5483,IV,Of Assur upon the hills of the world
5484,IV,"Hast tript and sent him hugely sliding,"
5485,IV,"Like a shot beast, down from his towering,"
5486,IV,By his own lamed
5487,IV,Mightiness hurl'd
5488,IV,To lie a filth in disaster.
5489,IV,"Deborah and Jael, famously named,"
5490,IV,"Like rich lands enriching the city their master,"
5491,IV,Bring thee now their most golden honour.
5492,IV,For the beauty of thy limbs was found
5493,IV,By a dreadfuller enemy dreadful as the sound
5494,IV,"Of Deborah's singing, though hers was a song"
5495,IV,That had for its words thousands of men.
5496,IV,"But thou thyself, looking upon them,"
5497,IV,Didst weaken the Assyrians mortally.
5498,IV,They thought it terrible to see thee coming;
5499,IV,"They falter'd in their impiousness,"
5500,IV,Their hearts gave in to thee; they went
5501,IV,Backward before thee and shewed thee the tent
5502,IV,"Where Holofernes would have thee in to him,"
5503,IV,"Yea, for his slayer waiting,"
5504,IV,"Waiting thee to entertain,"
5505,IV,"Desiring thee, his death, to enjoy, as Jael"
5506,IV,Waited for Sisera her slain.

5509,IV,Have done! Do you think I know not why your souls
5510,IV,Are so delighted round me? Do you think
5511,IV,"I see not what it is you praise?--not me,"
5512,IV,But you yourselves triumphing in me and over me.
5513,IV,
5514,IV,_A Citizen_.
5515,IV,Did we kill Holofernes?
5516,IV,
5517,IV,_Judith_.
5518,IV,No: nor I.
5519,IV,"That corpse was not his death. He is alive,"
5520,IV,And will be till there is no more a world
5521,IV,"Filled with his hidden hunger, waiting for souls"
5522,IV,That ford the monstrous waters of the world.
5523,IV,"Alive in you is Holofernes now,"
5524,IV,But fed and rejoicing; I have filled your hunger.
5525,IV,"Yea, and alive in me: my spirit hath been"
5526,IV,"Enjoyed by the lust of the world, and I am changed"
5527,IV,"Vilely by the vile thing that clutcht on me,"
5528,IV,Like sulphurous smoke eating into silver.
5529,IV,"Your song is all of this, this your rejoicing;"
5530,IV,You have good right to circle me with song!
5531,IV,"You are the world, and you have fed on me."
5532,IV,
5533,IV,_A Citizen_.
5534,IV,"We are the world; yes, but the world for ever"
5535,IV,Honouring thee.
5536,IV,
5537,IV,_Judith_.
5538,IV,"How am I honoured so,"
5539,IV,"If I no honour have for the world, but rather"
5540,IV,"Hold it an odious and traitorous thing,"
5541,IV,That means no honour but to those whose spirits
5542,IV,Have yielded to its ancient lechery?--
5543,IV,"Defiled, defiled!"
5544,IV,
5545,IV,_A Citizen_.
5546,IV,Thou wert moved by our grief:
5547,IV,Was that a vile thing?
5548,IV,
5549,IV,_Judith_.
5550,IV,That was the cunning world.
5551,IV,It moved me by your grief to give myself
5552,IV,Into the pleasure of its ravenous love.
5553,IV,
5554,IV,_A Citizen_.
5555,IV,"Judith, if thy hot spirit beareth still"
5556,IV,"Indignant suffering of villainy,"
5557,IV,"Think, that thou hast no wrong from it. Such things"
5558,IV,"Are in themselves dead, and have only life"
5559,IV,From what lives round them. And around thee glory
5560,IV,Lives and will force its splendour on the harm
5561,IV,"Thy purity endured, making it shine"
5562,IV,"Like diamond in sunlight, as before"
5563,IV,Unviolated it could not.
5564,IV,
5565,IV,_Judith_.
5566,IV,"Ay, to you"
5567,IV,"I doubt not I seem admirable now,"
5568,IV,Worthy of being sung in loudest praise;
5569,IV,But to myself how seem I?
5570,IV,
5571,IV,_A Citizen_.
5572,IV,Surely as one
5573,IV,"Whose charity went down the stairs of hell,"
5574,IV,And barter'd with the fiends thy sacredest
5575,IV,For our deliverance.
5576,IV,
5577,IV,_Judith_.
5578,IV,And that you praise!--
5579,IV,I was a virgin spirit. Whence I come
5580,IV,"I know not, and I care not whither I go."
5581,IV,One fearful knowledge holds me: that I am
5582,IV,A spirit walking dangerously here.
5583,IV,"For the world covets me. I am alone,"
5584,IV,"And made of something which the world has not,"
5585,IV,Unless its substance can devour my spirit.
5586,IV,And it hath devoured me! In Holofernes
5587,IV,"It seized me, fed on me; and then gibed on me,"
5588,IV,"With show of his death scoffing at my rage,--"
5589,IV,"His death!--He lay there, drunken, glutted with me,"
5590,IV,"And his bare falchion hung beside the bed,--"
5591,IV,"Look on it, and look on the blood I made"
5592,IV,Go pouring thunder of pleasure through his brain!--
5593,IV,And like a mad thing hitting at the madness
5594,IV,"Thronging upon it in a grinning rout,"
5595,IV,"I my defilement smote, that Holofernes."
5596,IV,"But does a maniac kill the frenzy in him,"
5597,IV,When with his fists he beats the clambering fiends
5598,IV,That swarm against his limbs? No more did I
5599,IV,Kill my defilement; it was fast within me;
5600,IV,And like a frenzy can go out of me
5601,IV,And dress its hideous motions in my world.
5602,IV,"For when I come back here, behold the thing"
5603,IV,I murdered in the camp leaps up and yells!
5604,IV,"The carrion Holofernes, my defilement,"
5605,IV,"Dances a triumph round me, roars and rejoices,"
5606,IV,Quickened to hundreds of exulting lives.
5607,IV,
5608,IV,_A Citizen_.
5609,IV,God help thee in this wildness! Are we then
5610,IV,As Holofernes to thee?
5611,IV,
5612,IV,_Judith_.
5613,IV,You are naught
5614,IV,"But the defilement that is in me now,"
5615,IV,Rejoicing to be lodged safely within me.
5616,IV,"You are the lust I entertained, rejoicing"
5617,IV,To wreak itself upon my purity.
5618,IV,"The stratagems of my ravishment you are,"
5619,IV,Rejoicing that the will you serve has dealt
5620,IV,"Its power on me. O, I hate you not."
5621,IV,You and your crying grief should have blown past
5622,IV,My heart like wind shaking a fasten'd casement.
5623,IV,But I must have you in. Myself I loathe
5624,IV,"For opening to you, and thereby opening"
5625,IV,To the demon which had set you on to whine
5626,IV,Pitiably in the porches of my spirit.
5627,IV,"You are but noise; but he is the lust of the world,"
5628,IV,"The infinite wrong the spirit, the virgin spirit,"
5629,IV,"Must fasten against, or be for ever vile."
5630,IV,
5631,IV,_A Citizen_.
5632,IV,"But is it naught that we, the folk of God,"
5633,IV,Are safe by thee?
5634,IV,
5635,IV,_Judith_.
5636,IV,God hath his own devices.
5637,IV,But I would be God's helper! I would be
5638,IV,Known as the woman whom his strength had chosen
5639,IV,"To ruin the Assyrians!--O my God,"
5640,IV,How dreadfully thou punishest small sins!
5641,IV,If it is thou who punishest; but rather
5642,IV,"It is that, when we slacken in perceiving"
5643,IV,"The world's intent towards us, and fatally,"
5644,IV,"Enticed out of suspicion by fair signs,"
5645,IV,"Go from ignoring its proposals, down"
5646,IV,"To parley,--thou our weakness dost permit."
5647,IV,In all my days I from the greed of the world
5648,IV,"Virginal have kept my spirit's dwelling,--"
5649,IV,"Till now; yea, all my being I have maintained"
5650,IV,Sacredly my own possession; for love
5651,IV,But made more beautiful and more divine
5652,IV,"My spirit's ownership. And yet no warning,"
5653,IV,When I infatuate went down to be
5654,IV,"Procuress of myself to the world's desire,"
5655,IV,"Did God blaze on my blindness, no rebuke."
5656,IV,"Therefore I am no more my virgin own,"
5657,IV,"But hatefully, unspeakably, the world's."
5658,IV,To these now I belong; they took me and used me.
5659,IV,I have no pride to live for; and why else
5660,IV,"Should one stay living, if not joyfully proud?"
5661,IV,For I have yielded now; mercilessly
5662,IV,What is makes foolish nothing of what was.
5663,IV,"To know the world, for all its grasping hands,"
5664,IV,For all its heat to utter its pent nature
5665,IV,"Into the souls that must go faring through it,"
5666,IV,"Availing nothing against purity,"
5667,IV,"Made always like rebellion trodden under,--"
5668,IV,By this was life a noble labour. Now
5669,IV,I have been persuaded into the world's pleasure:
5670,IV,And now at last I will all certainly
5671,IV,Contrive for myself the death of Holofernes.

5684,IV,"What moves in me is strange and uncontrolled,"
5685,IV,That once I thought was ruled: thou knew'st me better.--
5686,IV,Indeed thou must forgive me; what was I
5687,IV,To take so bitterly thy suit? What right
5688,IV,"Had I to give thee anger, when thou wouldst"
5689,IV,"Brighten thy hopeless death with me enjoyed,"
5690,IV,"I, even from that anger, going to be"

5693,IV,My spirit answered thee so fiercely then
5694,IV,"Because it felt thee reading me aright,"
5695,IV,How a mere bragging was my purity.
5696,IV,"But now to pardon askt, I must add thanks.--"
5697,IV,I had forgot Manasses! Even love
5698,IV,Was driven forth of me by these loud mouths!
5699,IV,"Whether in death he waits for me, I know not;"
5700,IV,But it had been an unforgivable thing
5701,IV,To have made this the end; not to have gone
5702,IV,"To death as unto spousals, leaving life"
5703,IV,"As one sets down a work faithfully done,"
5704,IV,"And knows oneself by service justified,"
5705,IV,"Worthy of love, whether love be or not."
5706,IV,"But, soiled with detestation, to have thrown"
5707,IV,Fiercely aside the garment of this light;
5708,IV,"Proved at the last impatient, death desiring"
5709,IV,Like a mere doffing of foul drenchèd clothes;
5710,IV,Release from the wicked hindering mire of sorrow;
5711,IV,A comfortable darkness hiding me
5712,IV,Out of the glowing world myself have made
5713,IV,"An insult, domineering me with splendour;--"
5714,IV,"O such a death had turned, past all forgiving,"
5715,IV,"My insult to Manasses, and searcht him out,"
5716,IV,"Even where he is quiet, with the blaze,"
5717,IV,"Ranging like din, of this contempt, this triumph."
5718,IV,Not crying out such hateful news should I
5719,IV,"Flee hunted into death, unto my love."
5720,IV,"From this, Ozias, thou hast saved me. Now"

5734,IV,Of the new shining glory she herself
5735,IV,Has brought to conquer in our skies the storm.
5736,IV,You do well to be dumb: for you have seen
5737,IV,"Virginity. That spirit you have seen,"
5738,IV,"Seen made wrathfully plain that secret spirit,"
5739,IV,Whereby is man's frail scabbard filled with steel.
5740,IV,"This, cumbered in the earthen kind of man,"
5741,IV,"Which ceaseless waters would be wearing down,"

5751,IV,And looking upward out of it to find
5752,IV,"Who knows what sign?--spirit, virginity;"
5753,IV,A power caught by the power of the world;
5754,IV,The spirit in whose unknown hope doth man
5755,IV,Deny the mastery of his fortune here;
5756,IV,"Virginity, whose pride, impassion'd only"
5757,IV,"To be as she herself would be, nor thence"

5759,IV,"And, though all give the rash obedience, stand"

5764,IV,Fearful turmoil of being conscious man.

5766,IV,"Grow into high divine imagination,"
5767,IV,Wherein the envious wildness of the world

5900,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,We are transgressing into Heavenly hours?
5901,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Or, threading the dark worldly multitude"
5902,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"And making lightning of its path, there comes"
5903,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,A zeal from God posting along our lives.
5904,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
5905,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_He_.
5906,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"For some eternal pulse hath chosen us,"
5907,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Some divine anger beats within our hearts.
5908,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
5909,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_She_.
5910,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Anger? But how far off is love from anger!
5911,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
5912,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_He_.
5913,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Nay, both belong to joy; joy's kind is twain."
5914,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,And close as in the pouring of sun-flame
5915,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Are mingled glory of light and fury of heat,"
5916,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Joy utters its twin radiance, love and anger;"
5917,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,If joy be not indeed all sacred wrath
5918,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,With circumstance; indignant memory
5919,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Of what hath been, when the new lusts of God"
5920,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Exulted unimaginably, before"
5921,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Rigours of law fastened like creeping habit
5922,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Upon their measureless wont, and forced them drive"
5923,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Their ranging music of delighted being
5924,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Through the fixt beating tune of a circling world.--
5925,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Is not love so? Amazement of an anger
5926,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Against created shape and narrowness?
5927,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,The bound rage of the uncreated Spirit
5928,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Whose striving doth impassion us and the world?
5929,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,A wrath that thou and I are not one being?
5930,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
5931,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_She_.
5932,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Yes, and not only words that thou and I"
5933,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Out of our sexes with a flame's escape
5934,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Are fashioned into one. The Spirit in us
5935,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Hath, like imagination in a prison,"
5936,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Kindled itself free of all boundary,"
5937,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"So that it hath no room but its own joy,"
5938,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Ample as at the first, before it fell"
5939,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Into this burthenous habit of a world.
5940,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,What have we now to do with the world? We are
5941,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Made one unworldly thing; we are past the world;
5942,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Yea, and unmade: we are immortality."
5943,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
5944,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_He_.
5945,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"And only fools abominably crazed,"
5946,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Those who will set imagination down
5947,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"As less in truth than their dim sensual wit,"
5948,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Dare doubt that, while these dreams of ours, these bodies,"
5949,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Still quiver in the world each with its own
5950,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Delight, the great divine wrath of our love"
5951,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Hath stricken off from us the place of the world!
5952,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Yea, as we walk in spiritual freedom"
5953,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Upright before the shining face of God,"
5954,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Behold, as it were the shadow of our stature"
5955,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Thrown by that light, we draw the world behind us,--"
5956,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"That world wherein, darkly I remember,"
5957,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,We thought we were as twain.
5958,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
5959,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_She_.
5960,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Yet, since God means"
5961,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,That love should sunder our fixt separateness
5962,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"And make our married spirits leap together,"
5963,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"As lightning out of the clouds of sexual flesh,"
5964,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Into one sexless undivided joy;
5965,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Why hath he made us a divided flesh?
5966,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"We being single ecstasy, now as strange"
5967,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,As if a shadow stained where no one stood
5968,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"The ground in the noon-glare, seemeth to me"
5969,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,The long blind time wherein our lives and the world
5970,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Lay stretcht out dark upon the light of heaven,"
5971,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Like shadow of some bulk that took the glory;
5972,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"While yet there stood not over it, to shade"
5973,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"The splendour from it, our heaven-fronting love,"
5974,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,This great new soul that our two souls have kindled.
5975,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Yea, and how like, that in the world's chance-medley"
5976,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"This our exulting destiny had been slain,"
5977,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Though here it lords the world as a man his shadow!
5978,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
5979,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_He_.
5980,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"But the world is not chance, except to those"
5981,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Most feeble in desire: who needeth aught
5982,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Shall have it, if he fill his soul with the need."
5983,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,While still our ignorant lives were drowned beneath
5984,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"The flooding of the earthly fate, and chance"
5985,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Seemed pouring mightily dark and loud between us,"
5986,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Unspeakable news oft visited our hearts:
5987,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"We knew each other by desire; yea, spake"
5988,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Out of the strength of darkness flowing o'er us,"
5989,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Across the hindering outcry of the world
5990,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,One to another sweet desirable things.
5991,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Until at last we took such heavenly lust
5992,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Of those unheard messages into our lives,"
5993,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,We were made abler than the worldly fate.
5994,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,We held its random enmity as frost
5995,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"The storming Northern seas, and fastened it"
5996,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,In likeness of our love's imagining;
5997,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Or as a captain with his courage holds
5998,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"The mutinous blood of an army aghast with fear,"
5999,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"And maketh it unwillingly dare his purpose,"
6000,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Our lust of love struck its commandment deep
6001,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Into the froward turbulence of world
6002,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,That parted us. Suddenly the dark noise
6003,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Cleft and went backward from us, and we stood"
6004,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Knowing each other in a quiet light;
6005,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,And like wise music made of many strings
6006,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Following and adoring underneath
6007,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Prevailing song, fate lived beneath our love,"
6008,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Under the masterful excellent silence of it,"
6009,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,A multitudinous obedience.
6010,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
6011,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_She_.
6012,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Yea, but not this my marvel: not that we"
6013,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Should master with desire the sundering world,"
6014,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"We who bore in our hearts such destiny,"
6015,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,There was no force knew to be dangerous
6016,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Against it, but must turn its malice clean"
6017,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Into obsequious favour worshipping us.
6018,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Rather hath this astonisht me, that we"
6019,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Have not for ever lived in this high hour.
6020,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Only to be twin elements of joy
6021,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"In this extravagance of Being, Love,"
6022,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Were our divided natures shaped in twain;
6023,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,And to this hour the whole world must consent.
6024,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Is it not very marvellous, our lives"
6025,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Can only come to this out of a long
6026,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Strange sundering, with the years of the world between us?"
6027,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
6028,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_He_.
6029,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Shall life do more than God? for hath not God
6030,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Striven with himself, when into known delight"
6031,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"His unaccomplisht joy he would put forth,--"
6032,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,This mystery of a world sign of his striving?
6033,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Else wherefore this, a thing to break the mind"
6034,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"With labouring in the wonder of it, that here"
6035,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Being--the world and we--is suffered to be!--
6036,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"But, lying on thy breast one notable day,"
6037,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Sudden exceeding agony of love
6038,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Made my mind a trance of infinite knowledge.
6039,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,I was not: yet I saw the will of God
6040,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"As light unfashion'd, unendurable flame,"
6041,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Interminable, not to be supposed;"
6042,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"And there was no more creature except light,--"
6043,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,The dreadful burning of the lonely God's
6044,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Unutter'd joy. And then, past telling, came"
6045,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Shuddering and division in the light:
6046,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Therein, like trembling, was desire to know"
6047,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Its own perfect beauty; and it became
6048,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"A cloven fire, a double flaming, each"
6049,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Adorable to each; against itself
6050,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Waging a burning love, which was the world;--"
6051,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,A moment satisfied in that love-strife
6052,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"I knew the world!--And when I fell from there,"
6053,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Then knew I also what this life would do
6054,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"In being twain,--in being man and woman!"
6055,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"For it would do even as its endless Master,"
6056,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Making the world, had done; yea, with itself"
6057,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Would strive, and for the strife would into sex"
6058,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Be cloven, double burning, made thereby"
6059,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Desirable to itself. Contrivèd joy
6060,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Is sex in life; and by no other thing
6061,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Than by a perfect sundering, could life"
6062,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Change the dark stream of unappointed joy
6063,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"To perfect praise of itself, the glee that loves"
6064,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,And worships its own Being. This is ours!
6065,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Yet only for that we have been so long
6066,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Sundered desire: thence is our life all praise.--
6067,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"But we, well knowing by our strength of joy"
6068,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"There is no sundering more, how far we love"
6069,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"From those sad lives that know a half-love only,"
6070,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Alone thereby knowing themselves for ever
6071,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Sealed in division of love, and therefore made"
6072,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,To pour their strength out always into their love's
6073,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Fierceness, as green wood bleeds its hissing sap"
6074,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Into red heat of a fire! Not so do we:
6075,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"The cloven anger, life, hath left to wage"
6076,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Its flame against itself, here turned to one"
6077,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Self-adoration.--Ah, what comes of this?"
6078,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"The joy falters a moment, with closed wings"
6079,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Wearying in its upward journey, ere"
6080,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Again it goes on high, bearing its song,"
6081,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Its delight breathing and its vigour beating
6082,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,The highest height of the air above the world.
6083,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
6084,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_She_.
6085,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"What hast thou done to me!--I would have soul,"
6086,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Before I knew thee, Love, a captive held"
6087,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"By flesh. Now, inly delighted with desire,"
6088,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,My body knows itself to be nought else
6089,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,But thy heart's worship of me; and my soul
6090,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Therein is sunlight held by warm gold air.
6091,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Nay, all my body is become a song"
6092,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Upon the breath of spirit, a love-song."
6093,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
6094,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_He_.
6095,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"And mine is all like one rapt faculty,"
6096,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"As it were listening to the love in thee,"
6097,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,My whole mortality trembling to take
6098,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Thy body like heard singing of thy spirit.
6099,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
6100,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_She_.
6101,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Surely by this, Beloved, we must know"
6102,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Our love is perfect here,--that not as holds"
6103,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"The common dullard thought, we are things lost"
6104,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,In an amazement that is all unware;
6105,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,But wonderfully knowing what we are!
6106,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Lo, now that body is the song whereof"
6107,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Spirit is mood, knoweth not our delight?"
6108,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Knoweth not beautifully now our love,"
6109,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"That Life, here to this festival bid come"
6110,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Clad in his splendour of worldly day and night,"
6111,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Filled and empower'd by heavenly lust, is all"
6112,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,The glad imagination of the Spirit?
6113,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
6114,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_He_.
6115,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Were it not so, Love could not be at all:"
6116,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Nought could be, but a yearning to fulfil"
6117,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Desire of beauty, by vain reaching forth"
6118,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Of sense to hold and understand the vision
6119,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Made by impassion'd body,--vision of thee!"
6120,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"But music mixt with music are, in love,"
6121,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Bodily senses; and as flame hath light,"
6122,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Spirit this nature hath imagined round it,"
6123,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"No way concealed therein, when love comes near,"
6124,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Nor in the perfect wedding of desires
6125,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Suffering any hindrance.
6126,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
6127,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_She_.
6128,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Ah, but now,"
6129,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Now am I given love's eternal secret!
6130,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Yea, thou and I who speak, are but the joy"
6131,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Of our for ever mated spirits; but now
6132,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,The wisdom of my gladness even through Spirit
6133,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Looks, divinely elate. Who hath for joy"
6134,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Our Spirits? Who hath imagined them
6135,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Round him in fashion'd radiance of desire,"
6136,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,As into light of these exulting bodies
6137,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Flaming Spirit is uttered?
6138,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,
6139,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,_He_.
6140,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Yea, here the end"
6141,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Of love's astonishment! Now know we Spirit,"
6142,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"And Who, for ease of joy, contriveth Spirit."
6143,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Now all life's loveliness and power we have
6144,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Dissolved in this one moment, and our burning"
6145,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Carries all shining upward, till in us"
6146,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Life is not life, but the desire of God,"
6147,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Himself desiring and himself accepting.
6148,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Now what was prophecy in us is made
6149,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Fulfilment: we are the hour and we are the joy,"
6150,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"We in our marvellousness of single knowledge,"
6151,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Of Spirit breaking down the room of fate
6152,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,And drawing into his light the greeting fire
6153,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,"Of God,--God known in ecstasy of love"
6154,THE ETERNAL WEDDING,Wedding himself to utterance of himself.

6163,I,
6164,I,"Come up, dear chosen morning, come,"
6165,I,"Blessing the air with light,"
6166,I,And bid the sky repent of being dark:
6167,I,"Let all the spaces round the world be white,"
6168,I,And give the earth her green again.
6169,I,"Into new hours of beautiful delight,"
6170,I,"Out of the shadow where she has lain,"
6171,I,"Bring the earth awake for glee,"
6172,I,Shining with dews as fresh and clear
6173,I,As my beloved's voice upon the air.
6174,I,"For now, O morning chosen of all days, on thee"
6175,I,A wondrous duty lies:
6176,I,There was an evening that did loveliness foretell;
6177,I,"Thence upon thee, O chosen morn, it fell"
6178,I,To fashion into perfect destiny
6179,I,The radiant prophecy.
6180,I,"For in an evening of young moon, that went"
6181,I,"Filling the moist air with a rosy fire,"
6182,I,I and my beloved knew our love;
6183,I,"And knew that thou, O morning, wouldst arise"
6184,I,To give us knowledge of achieved desire.
6185,I,"For, standing stricken with astonishment,"
6186,I,"Half terrified in the delight,"
6187,I,Even as the moon did into clear air move
6188,I,"And made a golden light,"
6189,I,"Lo there, croucht up against it, a dark hill,"
6190,I,"A monstrous back of earth, a spine"
6191,I,"Of hunchèd rock, furred with great growth of pine,"
6192,I,"Lay like a beast, snout in its paws, asleep;"
6193,I,"Yet in its sleeping seemed it miserable,"
6194,I,As though strong fear must always keep
6195,I,"Hold of its heart, and drive its blood in dream."
6196,I,"Yea, for to our new love, did it not seem,"
6197,I,"That dark and quiet length of hill,"
6198,I,The sleeping grief of the world?--Out of it we
6199,I,Had like imaginations stept to be
6200,I,Beauty and golden wonder; and for the lovely fear
6201,I,"Of coming perfect joy, had changed"
6202,I,The terror that dreamt there!
6203,I,And now the golden moon had turned
6204,I,"To shining white, white as our souls that burned"
6205,I,With vision of our prophecy assured:
6206,I,Suddenly white was the moon; but she
6207,I,At once did on a woven modesty
6208,I,"Of cloud, and soon went in obscured:"
6209,I,"And we were dark, and vanisht that strange hill."
6210,I,But yet it was not long before
6211,I,"There opened in the sky a narrow door,"
6212,I,Made with pearl lintel and pearl sill;
6213,I,"And the earth's night seem'd pressing there,--"
6214,I,"All as a beggar on some festival would peer,--"
6215,I,"To gaze into a room of light beyond,"
6216,I,The hidden silver splendour of the moon.
6217,I,"Yea, and we also, we"
6218,I,Long gazed wistfully
6219,I,"Towards thee, O morning, come at last,"
6220,I,And towards the light that thou wilt pour upon us soon!
6221,I,
6222,I,
6223,II,II
6224,II,
6225,II,"O soul who still art strange to sense,"
6226,II,"Who often against beauty wouldst complain,"
6227,II,Doubting between joy and pain:
6228,II,If like the startling touch of something keen
6229,II,"Against thee, it hath been"
6230,II,To follow from an upland height
6231,II,The swift sun hunting rain
6232,II,"Across the April meadows of a plain,"
6233,II,Until the fields would flash into the air
6234,II,"Their joyous green, like emeralds alight;"
6235,II,Or when in the blue of night's mid-noon
6236,II,The burning naked moon
6237,II,"Draws to a brink of cloudy weather near,"
6238,II,"A breadth of snow, firm and soft as a wing,"
6239,II,"Stretcht out over a wind that gently goes,--"
6240,II,Through the white sleep of snowy cloud there grows
6241,II,"An azure-border'd shining ring,"
6242,II,The gleaming dream of the approaching joy of her;--
6243,II,"What now wilt thou do, Soul? What now,"
6244,II,If with such things as these troubled thou wert?
6245,II,"How wilt thou now endure, or how"
6246,II,Not now be strangely hurt?--
6247,II,When utter beauty must come closer to thee
6248,II,Than even anger or fear could be;
6249,II,"When thou, like metal in a kiln, must lie"
6250,II,Seized by beauty's mightily able flame;
6251,II,Enjoyed by beauty as by the ruthless glee
6252,II,Of an unescapable power;
6253,II,Obeying beauty as air obeys a cry;
6254,II,"Yea, one thing made of beauty and thee,"
6255,II,As steel and a white heat are made the same!
6256,II,"--Ah, but I know how this infirmity"
6257,II,"Will fail and be not, no, not memory,"
6258,II,When I begin the marvellous hour.
6259,II,"This only is my heart's strain'd eagerness,"
6260,II,Long waiting for its bliss.--
6261,II,"But from those other fears, from those"
6262,II,"That keep to Love so close,"
6263,II,"From fears that are the shadow of delight,"
6264,II,"Hide me, O joys; make them unknown to-night!"

6271,III,"Knew I not thee, thee and thy heart,"
6272,III,"Knew I not well, God, who thou wert?"
6273,III,"Yea, and my soul divinely understood"
6274,III,"The light that was beneath thee a ground,"
6275,III,"The golden light that cover'd thee round,"
6276,III,"Turning my sleep to a fiery morn,"
6277,III,Was as a heavenly oath there sworn
6278,III,Promising me an immortal good:
6279,III,"Well I knew thee, God of Marriages, thee and thy flame!"
6280,III,"Ah, but wherefore beside thee came"
6281,III,That fearful sight of another mood?
6282,III,"Why in thy light, to thy hand chained,"
6283,III,"Towards me its bondage terribly strained,"
6284,III,"Why came with thee that dreadful hound,"
6285,III,"The wild hound Fear, black, ravenous and gaunt?"
6286,III,Why him with thee should thy dear light surround?
6287,III,Why broughtest thou that beast to haunt
6288,III,The blissful footsteps of my golden dream?--
6289,III,"All shadowy black the body dread,"
6290,III,"All frenzied fire the head,--"
6291,III,"The hunger of its mouth a hollow crimson flame,"
6292,III,The hatred in its eyes a blaze
6293,III,"Fierce and green, stabbing the ruddy glaze,"
6294,III,"And sharp white jetting fire the teeth snarl'd at me,"
6295,III,"And white the dribbling rage of froth,--"
6296,III,"A throat that gaped to bay and paws working violently,"
6297,III,Yet soundless all as a winging moth;
6298,III,"Tugging towards me, famishing for my heart;--"
6299,III,"Even while thou, O golden god, wert still"
6300,III,Looking the beautiful kindness of thy will
6301,III,"Into my soul, even then must I be,"
6302,III,"With thy bright promise looking at me,"
6303,III,Then bitterly of that hound afraid?--
6304,III,"Darkness, I know, attendeth bright,"
6305,III,And light comes not but shadow comes:
6306,III,"And heart must know, if it know thy light,"
6307,III,"Thy wild hound Fear, the shadow of love's delight."
6308,III,"Yea, is it thus? Are we so made"
6309,III,"Of death and darkness, that even thou,"
6310,III,"O golden God of the joys of love,"
6311,III,"Thy mind to us canst only prove,"
6312,III,"The glorious devices of thy mind,"
6313,III,By so revealing how thy journeying here
6314,III,"Through this mortality, doth closely bind"
6315,III,Thy brightness to the shadow of dreadful Fear?--
6316,III,"Ah no, it shall not be! Thy joyous light"
6317,III,Shall hide me from the hunger of fear to-night.

6321,IV,
6322,IV,For wonderfully to live I now begin:
6323,IV,So that the darkness which accompanies
6324,IV,"Our being here, is fasten'd up within"
6325,IV,The power of light that holdeth me;
6326,IV,"And from these shining chains, to see"
6327,IV,"My joy with bold misliking eyes,"
6328,IV,The shrouded figure will not dare arise.
6329,IV,"For henceforth, from to-night,"
6330,IV,I am wholly gone into the bright
6331,IV,Safety of the beauty of love:
6332,IV,Not only all my waking vigours plied
6333,IV,"Under the searching glory of love,"
6334,IV,But knowing myself with love all satisfied
6335,IV,Even when my life is hidden in sleep;
6336,IV,"As high clouds, to themselves that keep"
6337,IV,"The moon's white company, are all possest"
6338,IV,Silverly with the presence of their guest;
6339,IV,Or as a darken'd room
6340,IV,"That hath within it roses, whence the air"
6341,IV,And quietness are taken everywhere
6342,IV,Deliciously by sweet perfume.

6355,EPILOGUE,What shall we do for Love these days?
6356,EPILOGUE,How shall we make an altar-blaze
6357,EPILOGUE,To smite the horny eyes of men
6358,EPILOGUE,"With the renown of our Heaven,"
6359,EPILOGUE,And to the unbelievers prove
6360,EPILOGUE,"Our service to our dear god, Love?"
6361,EPILOGUE,What torches shall we lift above
6362,EPILOGUE,"The crowd that pushes through the mire,"
6363,EPILOGUE,To amaze the dark heads with strange fire?
6364,EPILOGUE,"I should think I were much to blame,"
6365,EPILOGUE,If never I held some fragrant flame
6366,EPILOGUE,"Above the noises of the world,"
6367,EPILOGUE,"And openly 'mid men's hurrying stares,"
6368,EPILOGUE,Worshipt before the sacred fears
6369,EPILOGUE,That are like flashing curtains furl'd
6370,EPILOGUE,Across the presence of our lord Love.
6371,EPILOGUE,"Nay, would that I could fill the gaze"
6372,EPILOGUE,Of the whole earth with some great praise
6373,EPILOGUE,"Made in a marvel for men's eyes,"
6374,EPILOGUE,"Some tower of glittering masonries,"
6375,EPILOGUE,Therein such a spirit flourishing
6376,EPILOGUE,Men should see what my heart can sing:
6377,EPILOGUE,All that Love hath done to me
6378,EPILOGUE,"Built into stone, a visible glee;"
6379,EPILOGUE,Marble carried to gleaming height
6380,EPILOGUE,As moved aloft by inward delight;
6381,EPILOGUE,"Not as with toil of chisels hewn,"
6382,EPILOGUE,But seeming poised in a mighty tune.
6383,EPILOGUE,For of all those who have been known
6384,EPILOGUE,"To lodge with our kind host, the sun,"
6385,EPILOGUE,I envy one for just one thing:
6386,EPILOGUE,In Cordova of the Moors
6387,EPILOGUE,"There dwelt a passion-minded King,"
6388,EPILOGUE,Who set great bands of marble-hewers
6389,EPILOGUE,To fashion his heart's thanksgiving
6390,EPILOGUE,"In a tall palace, shapen so"
6391,EPILOGUE,All the wondering world might know
6392,EPILOGUE,The joy he had of his Moorish lass.
6393,EPILOGUE,"His love, that brighter and larger was"
6394,EPILOGUE,"Than the starry places, into firm stone"
6395,EPILOGUE,"He sent, as if the stone were glass"
6396,EPILOGUE,Fired and into beauty blown.
6397,EPILOGUE,Solemn and invented gravely
6398,EPILOGUE,"In its bulk the fabric stood,"
6399,EPILOGUE,"Even as Love, that trusteth bravely"
6400,EPILOGUE,In its own exceeding good
6401,EPILOGUE,To be better than the waste
6402,EPILOGUE,"Of time's devices; grandly spaced,"
6403,EPILOGUE,Seriously the fabric stood.
6404,EPILOGUE,But over it all a pleasure went
6405,EPILOGUE,"Of carven delicate ornament,"
6406,EPILOGUE,"Wreathing up like ravishment,"
6407,EPILOGUE,Mentioning in sculptures twined
6408,EPILOGUE,The blitheness Love hath in his mind;
6409,EPILOGUE,And like delighted senses were
6410,EPILOGUE,"The windows, and the columns there"
6411,EPILOGUE,Made the following sight to ache
6412,EPILOGUE,As the heart that did them make.
6413,EPILOGUE,Well I can see that shining song
6414,EPILOGUE,"Flowering there, the upward throng"
6415,EPILOGUE,"Of porches, pillars and windowed walls,"
6416,EPILOGUE,"Spires like piercing panpipe calls,"
6417,EPILOGUE,Up to the roof's snow-cloud flight;
6418,EPILOGUE,All glancing in the Spanish light
6419,EPILOGUE,"White as water of arctic tides,"
6420,EPILOGUE,Save an amber dazzle on sunny sides.
6421,EPILOGUE,"You had said, the radiant sheen"
6422,EPILOGUE,Of that palace might have been
6423,EPILOGUE,"A young god's fantasy, ere he came"
6424,EPILOGUE,His serious worlds and suns to frame;
6425,EPILOGUE,Such an immortal passion
6426,EPILOGUE,Quiver'd among the slim hewn stone.
6427,EPILOGUE,And in the nights it seemed a jar
6428,EPILOGUE,"Cut in the substance of a star,"
6429,EPILOGUE,"Wherein a wine, that will be poured"
6430,EPILOGUE,"Some time for feasting Heaven, was stored."
6431,EPILOGUE,"But within this fretted shell,"
6432,EPILOGUE,"The wonder of Love made visible,"
6433,EPILOGUE,The King a private gentle mood
6434,EPILOGUE,"There placed, of pleasant quietude."
6435,EPILOGUE,"For right amidst there was a court,"
6436,EPILOGUE,Where always muskèd silences
6437,EPILOGUE,Listened to water and to trees;
6438,EPILOGUE,"And herbage of all fragrant sort,--"
6439,EPILOGUE,"Lavender, lad's-love, rosemary,"
6440,EPILOGUE,"Basil, tansy, centaury,--"
6441,EPILOGUE,"Was the grass of that orchard, hid"
6442,EPILOGUE,Love's amazements all amid.
6443,EPILOGUE,"Jarring the air with rumour cool,"
6444,EPILOGUE,Small fountains played into a pool
6445,EPILOGUE,With sound as soft as the barley's hiss
6446,EPILOGUE,When its beard just sprouting is;
6447,EPILOGUE,"Whence a young stream, that trod on moss,"
6448,EPILOGUE,Prettily rimpled the court across.
6449,EPILOGUE,"And in the pool's clear idleness,"
6450,EPILOGUE,"Moving like dreams through happiness,"
6451,EPILOGUE,Shoals of small bright fishes were;
6452,EPILOGUE,In and out weed-thickets bent
6453,EPILOGUE,"Perch and carp, and sauntering went"
6454,EPILOGUE,With mounching jaws and eyes a-stare;
6455,EPILOGUE,"Or on a lotus leaf would crawl,"
6456,EPILOGUE,"A brinded loach to bask and sprawl,"
6457,EPILOGUE,Tasting the warm sun ere it dipt
6458,EPILOGUE,Into the water; but quick as fear
6459,EPILOGUE,Back his shining brown head slipt
6460,EPILOGUE,"To crouch on the gravel of his lair,"
6461,EPILOGUE,"Where the cooled sunbeams broke in wrack,"
6462,EPILOGUE,Spilt shatter'd gold about his back.
6463,EPILOGUE,"So within that green-veiled air,"
6464,EPILOGUE,"Within that white-walled quiet, where"
6465,EPILOGUE,"Innocent water thought aloud,--"
6466,EPILOGUE,Childish prattle that must make
6467,EPILOGUE,The wise sunlight with laughter shake
6468,EPILOGUE,"On the leafage overbowed,--"
6469,EPILOGUE,Often the King and his love-lass
6470,EPILOGUE,Let the delicious hours pass.
6471,EPILOGUE,All the outer world could see
6472,EPILOGUE,Graved and sawn amazingly
6473,EPILOGUE,"Their love's delighted riotise,"
6474,EPILOGUE,Fixt in marble for all men's eyes;
6475,EPILOGUE,But only these twain could abide
6476,EPILOGUE,In the cool peace that withinside
6477,EPILOGUE,Thrilling desire and passion dwelt;
6478,EPILOGUE,They only knew the still meaning spelt
6479,EPILOGUE,"By Love's flaming script, which is"
6480,EPILOGUE,God's word written in ecstasies.
6481,EPILOGUE,
6482,EPILOGUE,"And where is now that palace gone,"
6483,EPILOGUE,"All the magical skill'd stone,"
6484,EPILOGUE,All the dreaming towers wrought
6485,EPILOGUE,By Love as if no more than thought
6486,EPILOGUE,The unresisting marble was?
6487,EPILOGUE,How could such a wonder pass?
6488,EPILOGUE,"Ah, it was but built in vain"
6489,EPILOGUE,"Against the stupid horns of Rome,"
6490,EPILOGUE,That pusht down into the common loam
6491,EPILOGUE,The loveliness that shone in Spain.
6492,EPILOGUE,But we have raised it up again!
6493,EPILOGUE,"A loftier palace, fairer far,"
6494,EPILOGUE,"Is ours, and one that fears no war."
6495,EPILOGUE,Safe in marvellous walls we are;
6496,EPILOGUE,"Wondering sense like builded fires,"
6497,EPILOGUE,"High amazement of desires,"
6498,EPILOGUE,"Delight and certainty of love,"
6499,EPILOGUE,"Closing around, roofing above"
6500,EPILOGUE,Our unapproacht and perfect hour
6501,EPILOGUE,Within the splendours of love's power.
