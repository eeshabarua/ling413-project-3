543,ROSMER.,
544,ROSMER.,"And so he took the ruddy gold,"

546,ROSMER.,Unknown to him proud Ellenlile
547,ROSMER.,So sly therein herself convey'd.
548,ROSMER.,
549,ROSMER.,"He takes the man beneath his arm,"

553,ROSMER.,
554,ROSMER.,"""Now have I brought thee to the land,"

571,ROSMER.,And when he came within the hill
572,ROSMER.,Behold proud Ellenlile was gone.
573,ROSMER.,
574,ROSMER.,"But Ellenlile took Roland's hand,"
575,ROSMER.,'Midst sport and jest away they hied;
