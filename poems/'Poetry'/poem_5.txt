TO MAURICE HEWLETT



    HEWLETT! as ship to ship
    Let us the ensign dip.
    There may be who despise
    For dross our merchandise,
    Our balladries, our bales
      Of woven tales;
    Yet, Hewlett, the glad gales
    Favonian! And what spray
    Our dolphins toss'd in play,
Full in old Triton's beard, on Iris' shimmering veils!

    Scant tho' the freight of gold
    Commercial in our hold,
    PÃ¦stum, Eridanus
    Perchance have barter'd us
   'Bove chrematistic care
