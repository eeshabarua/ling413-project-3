142,PROEM,"Sing of the end of Troy, and of that flood"
143,PROEM,Of passion by the blood
144,PROEM,"Of heroes consecrate, by poet's craft"
145,PROEM,"Hallowed, if that thin waft"
146,PROEM,Of godhead blown upon thee stretch thy song
147,PROEM,To span such store of strong
148,PROEM,And splendid vision of immortal themes
149,PROEM,"Late harvested in dreams,"
150,PROEM,Albeit long years laid up in tilth. Most meet
151,PROEM,Thou sing that slim and sweet
152,PROEM,Fair woman for whose bosom and delight
153,PROEM,"Paris, as well he might,"
154,PROEM,"Wrought all the woe, and held her to his cost"
155,PROEM,"And Troy's, and won and lost"
156,PROEM,Perforce; for who could look on her or feel
157,PROEM,Her near and not dare steal
158,PROEM,"One hour of her, or hope to hold in bars"
159,PROEM,Such wonder of the stars
160,PROEM,Undimmed? As soon expect to cage the rose
161,PROEM,Of dawn which comes and goes
162,PROEM,"Fitful, or leash the shadows of the hills,"
163,PROEM,Or music of upland rills
164,PROEM,As Helen's beauty and not tarnish it
165,PROEM,"With thy poor market wit,"
166,PROEM,"Adept to hue the wanton in the wild,"
167,PROEM,Defile the undefiled!
168,PROEM,"Yet by the oath thou swearedst, standing high"
169,PROEM,Where piled rocks testify
170,PROEM,"The holy dust, and from Therapnai's hold"
171,PROEM,Over the rippling wold
172,PROEM,"Didst look upon Amyklai's, where sunrise"
173,PROEM,"First dawned in Helen's eyes,"

180,PROEM,"Eloquent of her birthright. Tell his peace,"
181,PROEM,And hers who at last found ease
182,PROEM,"In white-arm'd Heré, holy husbander"
183,PROEM,Of purer fire than e'er
184,PROEM,"To wife gave Kypris. Helen, and Thee sing"

195,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,
196,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Where Simoeis and Xanthos, holy streams,"
197,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Flow brimming on the level, and chance gleams"
198,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Betray far Ida through a rended cloud
199,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"And hint the awful home of Zeus, whose shroud"
200,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,The thunder is--'twixt Ida and the main
201,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Behold gray Ilios, Priam's fee, the plain"
202,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,About her like a carpet; from whose height
203,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"The watchman, ten years watching, every night"
204,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Counteth the beacon fires and sees no less
205,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Their number as the years wax and duress
206,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Of hunger thins the townsmen day by day--
207,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,More than the Greeks kill plague and famine slay.
208,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Here in their wind-swept city, ten long years"
209,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Beset and in this tenth in blood and tears
210,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"And havocry to fall, old Priam's sons"
211,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Guard still their gods, their wives and little ones,"
212,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Guard Helen still, for whose fair womanhood"
213,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"The sin was done, woe wrought, and all the blood"
214,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Of Danaan and Dardan in their pride
215,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Shed; nor yet so the end, for Heré cried"
216,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Shrill on the heights more vengeance on wrong done,"
217,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,And Greek or Trojan paid it. Late or soon
218,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"By sword or bitter arrow they went hence,"
219,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Each with their goodliest paying one man's offence.
220,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Goodliest in Troy fell Hector; back to Greek
221,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Then swung the doomstroke, and to Dis the bleak"
222,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Must pass great Hector's slayer. Zeus on high,"
223,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Hidden from men, held up the scales; the sky"
224,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Told Thetis that her son must go the way
225,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"He sent Queen Hecuba's--himself must pay,"
226,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Himself though young, splendid Achilles' self,"
227,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"The price of manslaying, with blood for pelf."
228,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"A grief immortal took her, and she grieved"
229,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Deep in sea-cave, whereover restless heaved"
230,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"The wine-dark ocean--silently, not moving,"
231,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Tearless, a god. O Gods, however loving,"
232,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,That is a lonely grief that must go dry
233,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"About the graves where the beloved lie,"
234,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,And knows too much to doubt if death ends all
235,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Pleasure in strength of limb, joy musical,"
236,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Mother-love, maiden-love, which never more"
237,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Must the dead look for on the further shore
238,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Of Acheron, and past the willow-wood"
239,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Of Proserpine!
240,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"But when he understood,"
241,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Achilles, that his end was near at hand,"
242,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Darkling he heard the news, and on the strand"
243,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Beyond the ships he stood awhile, then cried"
244,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,The Sea-God that high-hearted and clear-eyed
245,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,He might go down; and this for utmost grace
246,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"He asked, that not by battle might his face"
247,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Be marred, nor fighting might some Dardan best"
248,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Him who had conquered ever. For the rest,"
249,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Fate, which had given, might take, as fate should be."
250,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"So prayed he, and Poseidon out of the sea,"
251,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,There where the deep blue into sand doth fade
252,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"And the long wave rolls in, a bar of jade,"
253,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Sent him a portent in that sea-blue bird
254,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Swifter than light, the halcyon; and men heard"
255,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"The trumpet of his praise: ""Shaker of Earth,"
256,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Hail to thee! Now I fare to death in mirth,"
257,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"As to a banquet!"""
258,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,So when day was come
259,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Lightly arose the prince to meet his doom,"
260,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,And kissed Briseïs where she lay abed
261,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,And never more by hers might rest his head:
262,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"""Farewell, my dear, farewell, my joy,"" said he;"
263,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"""Farewell to all delights 'twixt thee and me!"
264,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,For now I take a road whose harsh alarms
265,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Forbid so sweet a burden to my arms."""
266,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Then his clean limbs his weeping squires bedight
267,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,In all the mail Hephaistos served his might
268,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Withal, of breastplate shining like the sun"
269,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Upon flood-water, three-topped helm whereon"
270,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Gleamed the gold basilisk, and goodly greaves."
271,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,These bore he without word; but when from sheaves
272,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Of spears they picked the great ash Pelian
273,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Poseidon gave to Peleus, God to a man,"
274,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,For no man's manège else--than all men's fear:
275,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"""Dry and cold fighting for thee this day, my spear,"""
276,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Quoth he. And so when one the golden shield
277,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Immortal, daedal, for no one else to wield,"
278,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Cast o'er his head, he frowned: ""On thy bright face"
279,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Let me see who shall dare a dint,"" he says,"
280,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,And stood in thought full-armed; thereafter poured
281,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Libation at the tent-door to the Lord
282,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Of earth and sky, and prayed, saying: ""O Thou"
283,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"That hauntest dark Dodona, hear me now,"
284,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Since that the shadowing arm of Time is flung
285,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Far over me, but cloudeth me full young."
286,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Scatheless I vow them. Let one Trojan cast
287,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,His spear and loose my spirit. Rage is past
288,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Though I go forth my most provocative
289,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Adventure: 'tis not I that seek. Receive
290,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"My prayer Thou as I have earned it--lo,"
291,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Dying I stand, and hail Thee as I go"
292,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Lord of the Ægis, wonderful, most great!"""
293,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Which done, he took his stand, and bid his mate"
294,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Urge on the steeds; and all the Achaian host
295,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Followed him, not with outcry or loud boast"
296,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Of deeds to do or done, but silent, grim"
297,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"As to a shambles--so they followed him,"
298,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Eyeing that nodding crest and swaying spear
299,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Shake with the chariot. Solemn thus they near
300,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"The Trojan walls, slow-moving, as by a Fate"
301,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Driven; and thus before the Skaian Gate
302,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Stands he in pomp of dreadful calm, to die,"
303,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,As once in dreadful haste to slay.
304,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Thereby
305,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"The walls were thick with men, and in the towers"
306,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Women stood gazing, clustered close as flowers"
307,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,That blur the rocks in some high mountain pass
308,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,With delicate hues; but like the gray hill-grass
309,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Which the wind sweepeth, till in waves of light"
310,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,It tideth backwards--so all gray or white
311,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Showed they, as sudden surges moved them cloak"
312,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Their heads, or bare their faces. And none spoke"
313,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Among them, for there stood not woman there"
314,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"But mourned her dead, or sensed not in the air"
315,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Her pendent doom of death, or worse than death."
316,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Frail as flowers were their faces, and all breath"
317,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Came short and quick, as on this dreadful show"
318,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Staring, they pondered it done far below"
319,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,As on a stage where the thin players seem
320,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Unkith to them who watch, the stuff of dream."
321,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Nor else about the plain showed living thing
322,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Save high in the blue where sailed on outspread wing
323,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"A vulture bird intent, with mighty span"
324,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Of pinion.
325,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"In the hush spake the dead man,"
326,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Hollow-voiced, terrible: ""Ye tribes of Troy,"
327,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Here stand I out for death, and ye for joy"
328,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Of killing as ye will, by cast of spear,"
329,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,By bowshot or with sword. If any peer
330,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Of Hector or Sarpedon care the bout
331,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Which they both tried aforetime let him out

338,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Breathless stood all,"
339,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Not moving out; but Paris on the roof
340,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Of his high house, where snug he sat aloof,"
341,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Drew taut the bowstring home, and notched a shaft,"
342,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Soft whistling to himself, what time with craft"
343,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Of peering eyes and narrow twisted face
344,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,He sought an aim.
345,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Swift from her hiding-place
346,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Came burning Helen then, in her blue eyes"
347,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"A fire unquenchable, but cold as ice"

353,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"A screaming arrow, deadly, swerving not--"
354,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Then stood to watch the ruin he had wrought.
355,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,He heard the sob of breath o'er all the host
356,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Of hushing men; he marked, but then he lost,"
357,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,The blood-spurt at the shaft-head; for the crest
358,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Upheaved, the shoulders stiffen'd, ere to the breast"
359,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Bent down the head, as though the glazing sight"
360,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Curious would mark the death-spot. Still upright
361,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Stood he; but as a tree that on the side

363,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"And lightlier waves her leafy crown, and swings"
364,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,From side to side--so on his crest the wings
365,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Erect seemed shaking upwards, and to sag"
366,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"The spear's point, and the burden'd head to wag"
367,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Before the stricken body felt the stroke,"
368,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Or the strong knees grew lax, or the heart broke."
369,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Breathless they waited; then the failing man
370,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Stiffened anew his neck, and changed and wan"
371,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Looked for the last time in the face of day,"
372,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,And seemed to dare the Gods such might to slay
373,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"As this, the sanguine splendid thing he was,"
374,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Withal now gray of face and pinched. Alas,"
375,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,For pride of life! Now he had heard his knell.
376,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"His spirit passed, and crashing down he fell,"
377,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"Mighty Achilles, and struck the earth, and lay"
378,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"A huddled mass, a bulk of bronze and clay"

380,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,"There dropt a forest hush on watching Troy,"
381,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,Upon the plain and watching ranks of men;
382,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,And from a tower some woman keened him then
383,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,With long thin cry that wavered in the air--
384,THE DEATH OF ACHILLES,As once before one wailed her Hector there.

391,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,So he who wore his honour like a wreath
392,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,About his brows went the dark way of death;
393,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Which being done, that deed of ruth and doom"
394,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Gave breath to Troy; but on the Achaians gloom
395,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Settled like pall of cloud upon a land
396,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,That swoons beneath it. Desperate they scanned
397,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Each other, saying: ""Now we are left by God,"""
398,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And in the huts behind the wall abode,"
399,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Heeding not Diomede, Idomeneus,"

404,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Himself with pride, but he went raving there."
405,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,For in the high assembly Thetis made
406,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"In honour of her son, to waft his shade"
407,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"In peace to Hades' house, after the fire"
408,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Twice a man's height for him who did suspire
409,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Twice a man's heart and render it to Heaven
410,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Who gave it, after offerings paid and given,"
411,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And games of men and horses, she brought forth"
412,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,His regal arms for hero of most worth
413,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"In the broad Danaan host, who was adjudged"
414,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Odysseus by all voices. Aias grudged
415,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"The vote and wandered brooding, drawn apart"
416,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"From his room-fellows, seeding in his heart"
417,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Envy, which biting inwards did corrode"
418,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"His mettle, and his ill blood plied the goad"
419,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Upon his brain, until the wretch made mad"
420,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Went muttering his wrongs, ill-trimmed, ill-clad,"
421,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Sightless and careless, with slack mouth awry,"
422,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And working tongue, and danger in the eye;"
423,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And oft would stare at Heaven and laugh his scorn:
424,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"""O fools, think not to trick me!"" then forlorn"
425,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Would gaze about green earth or out to sea:
426,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"""This is the end of man in his degree""--"
427,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Thus would he moralise in those bare lands
428,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,With hopeless brows and tossing up of hands--
429,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"""To sow in sweat and see another reap!"""
430,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Then, pitying himself, he'd fall to weep"
431,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"His desolation, scorned by Gods, by men"
432,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Slighted; but in a flash he'd rage again
433,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And shake his naked sword at unseen foes,"
434,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And dare them bring Odysseus to his blows:
435,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Or let the man but flaunt himself in arms...!
436,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"So threatening God knows what of savage harms,"
437,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"On him the oxen patient in the marsh,"
438,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Knee-deep in rushes, gazed to hear his harsh"
439,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Outcry; and them his madness taught for Greeks,"
440,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,So on their dumb immensity he wreaks
441,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"His vengeance, driving in the press with shout"
442,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Of ""Aias! Aias!"" hurtling, carving out"
443,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"A way with mighty swordstroke, cut and thrust,"
444,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And makes a shambles in his witless lust;
445,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And in the midst, bloodshot, with blank wild eyes"
446,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Stands frothing at the lips, and after lies"
447,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"All reeking in his madman's battlefield,"
448,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And sleeps nightlong. But with the dawn's revealed
449,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,The pity of his folly; then he sees
450,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Himself at his fool's work. With shaking knees
451,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"He stands amid his slaughter, and his own"
452,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Adds to the wreck, plunging without a groan"
453,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Upon his planted sword. So Aias died
454,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Lonely; and he who, never from his side"
455,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Removed, had shared his fame, the Lokrian,"
456,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Abode the fate foreordered in the plan
457,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Which the Blind Women ignorantly weave.
458,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,
459,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"But think not on the dead, who die and leave"
460,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"A memory more fragrant than their deeds,"
461,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,But to the remnant rather and their needs
462,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Give thought with me. What comfort in their swords
463,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Have they, robbed of the might of two such lords"
464,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,As Peleus' son and Telamon's? What art
465,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Can drive the blood back to the stricken heart?
466,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Like huddled sheep cowed obstinate, as dull"
467,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,As oxen impotent the wain to pull
468,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Out of a rut, which, failing at first lunge,"
469,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Answer not voice nor goad, but sideways plunge"
470,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Or backward urge with lowered heads, or stand"
471,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Dumb monuments of sufferance--so unmanned
472,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"The Achaians brooded, nor their chiefs had care"
473,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"To drive them forth, since they too knew despair,"
474,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And neither saw in battle nor retreat
475,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,A way of honour.
476,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And the plain grew sweet
477,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Again with living green; the spring o' the year
478,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Came in with flush of flower and bird-call clear;
479,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And Nature, for whom nothing wrought is vain,"
480,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Out of shed blood caused grass to spring amain,"
481,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And seemed with tender irony to flout
482,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Man's folly and pain when twixt dead spears sprang out
483,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,The crocus-point and pied the plain with fires
484,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,More gracious than his beacons; and from pyres
485,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Of burnt dead men the asphodel uprose
486,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Like fleecy clouds flushed with the morning rose,"
487,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,A holy pall to hide his folly and pain.
488,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Thus upon earth hope fell like a new rain,"
489,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And by and by the pent folk within walls
490,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Took heart and ploughed the glebe and from the stalls
491,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Led out their kine to pasture. Goats and sheep
492,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Cropt at their ease, and herd-boys now did keep"
493,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Watch, where before stood armèd sentinels;"
494,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And battle-grounds were musical with bells
495,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Of feeding beasts. Afar, high-beacht, the ships"
496,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Loomed through the tender mist, their prows--like lips"
497,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Of thirsty birds which, lacking water, cry"
498,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Salvation out of Heaven--flung on high:
499,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Which marking, Ilios deemed her worst of road"
500,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Was travelled, and held Paris for a God"
501,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Who winged the shaft that brought them all this peace.
502,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,
503,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"He in their love went sunning, took his ease"
504,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"In house and hall, at council or at feast,"
505,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Careless of what was greatest or what least
506,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Of all his deeds, so only by his side"
507,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"She lay, the blush-rose Helen, stolen bride,"
508,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"The lovely harbour of his arms. But she,"
509,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"A thrall, now her own thralldom plain could see,"
510,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And sick of dalliance, loathed herself, and him"
511,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Who had beguiled her. Now through eyes made dim
512,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,With tears she looked towards the salt sea-beach
513,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Where stood the ships, and sought for sign in each"
514,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"If it might be her people's, and so hers,"
515,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Poor alien!--Argive now herself she avers
516,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And proudly slave of Paris and no wife:
517,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Minion she calls herself; and when to strife
518,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Of love he claims her, secret her heart surges"
519,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Back to her lord; and when to kiss he urges,"
520,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And when to play he woos her with soft words,"
521,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Secret her fond heart calleth, like a bird's,"
522,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Towards that honoured mate who honoured her,"
523,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Making her wife indeed, not paramour,"
524,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Mother, and sharer of his hearth and all"
525,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,His gear. Thus every night: and on the wall
526,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,She watches every dawn for what dawn brings.
527,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And the strong spirit of her took new wings
528,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And left her lovely body in the arms
529,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Of him who doted, conning o'er her charms,"
530,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And witless held a shell; but forth as light
531,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,As the first sigh of dawn her spirit took flight
532,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Across the dusky plain to where fires gleamed
533,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And muffled guards stood sentry; and it streamed
534,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Within the hut, and hovered like a wraith,"
535,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"A presence felt, not seen, as when gray Death"
536,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Seems to the dying man a bedside guest,"
537,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,But to the watchers cannot be exprest.
538,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"So hovered Helen in a dream, and yearned"
539,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Over the sleeper as he moaned and turned,"
540,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Renewing his day's torment in his sleep;
541,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Who presently starts up and sighing deep,"
542,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Searches the entry, if haply in the skies"
543,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"The day begin to stir. Lo there, her eyes"
544,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Like waning stars! Lo there, her pale sad face"
545,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Becurtained in loose hair! Now he can trace
546,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Athwart that gleaming moon her mouth's droopt bow
547,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"To tell all truth about her, and her woe"
548,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And dreadful store of knowledge. As one shockt
549,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"To worse than death lookt she, with horror lockt"
550,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Behind her tremulous tragic-moving lips:
551,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"""O love, O love,"" saith he, and saying, slips"
552,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Out of the bed: ""Who hath dared do thee wrong?"""
553,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"No answer hath she, but she looks him long"
554,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And deep, and looking, fades. He sleeps no more,"
555,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"But up and down he pads the beaten floor,"
556,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And all that day his heart's wild crying hears,"
557,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And can thank God for gracious dew of tears
558,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And tender thoughts of her, not thoughts of shame."
559,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"So came the next night, and with night she came,"
560,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Dream-Helen; and he knew then he must go
561,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Whence she had come. His need would have it so--
562,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And her need. Never must she call in vain.
563,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Now takes he way alone over the plain
564,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Where dark yet hovers like a catafalque
565,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And all life swoons, and only dead thing walk,"
566,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Uneasy sprites denied a resting space,"
567,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"That shudder as they flit from place to place,"
568,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Like bats of flaggy wing that make night blink
569,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"With endless quest: so do those dead, men think,"
570,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Who fall and are unserved by funeral rite.
571,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"These passes he, and nears the walls of might"
572,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Which Godhead built for proud Laomedon,"
573,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And knows the house of Paris built thereon,"
574,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Terraced and set with gadding vines and trees
575,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And ever falling water, for the ease"
576,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Of that sweet indweller he held in store.
577,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Thither he turns him quaking, but before"
578,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Him dares not look, lest he should see her there"
579,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Aglimmer through the dusk and, unaware,"
580,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Discover her fill some mere homely part
581,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Intolerably familiar to his heart,"
582,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"And deeply there enshrined and glorified,"
583,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Laid up with bygone bliss. Yet on he hied,"
584,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Being called, and ever closer on he came"
585,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,As if no wrong nor misery nor shame
586,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Could harder be than not to see her--Nay,"
587,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Even if within that smooth thief's arms she lay
588,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Besmothered in his kisses--rather so
589,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Had he stood stabbed to see, than on to go"
590,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,His round of lonely exile!
591,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Now he stands
592,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Beneath her house, and on his spear his hands"
593,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Rest, and upon his hands he grounds his chin,"
594,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And motionless abides till day come in;
595,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Pure of his vice, that he might ease her woe,"
596,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Not brand her with his own. Not yet the glow
597,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Of false dawn throbbed, nor yet the silent town"
598,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Stood washt in light, clear-printed to the crown"
599,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"In the cold upper air. Dark loomed the walls,"
600,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Ghostly the trees, and still shuddered the calls"
601,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Of owl to owl from unseen towers. Afar
602,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,A dog barked. High and hidden in the haar
603,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,Which blew in from the sea a heron cried
604,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Honk! and he heard his wings, but not espied"
605,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"The heavy flight. Slow, slow the orb was filled"
606,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"With light, and with the light his heart was thrilled"
607,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"With opening music, faint, expectant, sharp"
608,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,As the first chords one picks out from the harp
609,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"To prelude paean. Venturing all, he lift"
610,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"His eyes, and there encurtained in a drift"
611,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Of sea-blue mantle close-drawn, he espies"
612,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Helen above him watching, her grave eyes"
613,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Upon him fixt, blue homes of mystery"
614,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"Unfathomable, eternal as the sea,"
615,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,And as unresting.
616,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,"So in that still place,"
617,MENELAUS' DREAM: HELEN ON THE WALL,In that still hour stood those two face to face.

635,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Art thou so early from the wicked bed?
636,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,So prompt to slough the snugness of thy vice?
637,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Or is it that in luxury thou art nice
638,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Become, and dalliest?"" Low her head she hung"
639,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And moved her lips. As when the night is young
640,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"The hollow wind presages storm, his moan"
641,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Came wailing at her. ""Ten years here, alone,"
642,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And in that time to have seen thee thrice!"""
643,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,But she:
644,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""Often and often have I chanced to see"
645,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"My lord pass."""
646,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"His heart leapt, as leaps the child"
647,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Enwombed: ""Hast thou--?"""
648,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Faintly her quick eyes smiled:
649,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""At this time my house sleepeth, but I wake;"
650,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,So have time to myself when I can take
651,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"New air, and old thought."""
652,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,As a man who skills
653,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"To read high hope out of dark oracles,"
654,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,So gleamed his eyes; so fierce and quick said he:
655,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""Lady, O God! Now would that I could be"
656,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Beside thee there, breathing thy breath, thy thought"
657,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Gathering!"" Silent stood she, memory-fraught,"
658,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Nor looked his way. But he must know her soul,"
659,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"So harpt upon her heart. ""Is this the whole"
660,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"That thou wouldst have me think, that thou com'st here"
661,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Alone to be?"""
662,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,She blushed and dared to peer
663,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Downward. ""Is it so wonderful,"" she said,"
664,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""If I desire it?"" He: ""Nay, by my head,"
665,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Not so; but wonderful I think it is
666,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"In any man to suffer it."" The hiss"
667,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Of passion stript all vesture from his tones
668,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And showed the King man naked to the bones,"
669,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Man naked to the body's utterance.
670,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She turned her head, but felt his burning glance"
671,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Scorch, and his words leap up. ""Dost thou desire"
672,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"I leave thee then? Answer me that."""
673,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""Nay, sire,"
674,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Not so."" And he: ""Bid me to stay while sleeps"
675,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Thy house,"" he said, ""so stay I."" Her eyes' deeps"
676,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Flooded his soul and drowned him in despair,"
677,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Despair and rage. ""Behold now, ten years' wear"
678,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Between us and our love! Now if I cast
679,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"My spear and rove the snow-mound of thy breast,"
680,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Were that a marvel?"""
681,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Long she lookt and grave,"
682,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Pondering his face and searching. ""Not so brave"
683,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"My lord as that would prove him. Nay, and I know"
684,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"He would not do it."" And the truth was so;"
685,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And well he knew the reason: better she.
686,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Yet for a little in that vacancy
687,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Of silence and unshadowing light they stood,"
688,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Those long-divided, speechless. His first mood"
689,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"With bitter grudge was choked, but hers was mild,"
690,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"As fearing his. At last she named the child,"
691,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Asking, Was all well? Short he told her, Yes,"
692,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,The child was well. She fingered in her dress
693,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And watched her hand at play there.
694,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""Here,"" she said,"
695,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""There is no child,"" and sighed. Into his dead"
696,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And wasted heart there leaped a flame and caught
697,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"His hollow eyes. ""Rememberest thou naught,"
698,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Nothing regrettest, nothing holdst in grief"
699,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Of all our joy together ere that thief
700,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Came rifling in?"" For all her answer she"
701,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Lookt long upon him, long and earnestly;"
702,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And misty grew her eyes, and slowly filled."
703,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Slowly the great tears brimmed, and slowly rilled"
704,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Adown her cheeks. So presently she hid
705,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Those wells of grief, and hung her lovely head;"
706,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And he had no more words, but only a cry"
707,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"At heart too deep for utterance, and too high"
708,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,For tears.
709,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,
710,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And now came Paris from the house
711,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Into the sun, rosy and amorous,"
712,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,As when the sun himself from the sea-rim
713,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Lifteth, and gloweth on the earth grown dim"
714,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,With waiting; and he piped a low clear call
715,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,As mellow as the thrush's at the fall
716,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Of day from some near thicket. At whose sound
717,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Rose up caught Helen and blushing turned her round
718,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"To face him; but in going, ere she met"
719,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"The prince, her hand along the parapet"
720,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She trailed, palm out, for sign to who below"
721,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Rent at himself, nor had the wit to know"
722,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"In that dumb signal eloquence, and hope"
723,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Therein beyond his sick heart's utmost scope.
724,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Throbbing he stood as when a quick-blown peat,"
725,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Now white, now red, burns inly--O wild heat,"
726,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"O ravenous race of men, who'd barter Space"
727,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And Time for one short snatch of instant grace!
728,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Withal, next day, drawn by his dear desire,"
729,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,When as the young green burned like emerald fire
730,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"In the cold light, back to the tryst he came;"
731,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"But she was sooner there, and called his name"
732,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Softly as cooing dove her bosom's mate;
733,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And showed her eyes to him, which half sedate"
734,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"To be so sought revealed her, half in doubt"
735,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Lest he should deem her bold to meet the bout
736,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,With too much readiness. But high he flaunted
737,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Her name towards the sky. ""Thou God-enchanted,"
738,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Thou miracle of dawn, thou Heart of the Rose,"
739,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Hail thou!"" On his own eloquence he grows"
740,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"The lover he proclaims. ""O love,"" he saith,"
741,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""I would not leave thee for a moment's breath,"
742,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Nor once these ten long years had left thy side
743,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Had it been possible to stay!"""
744,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She sighed,"
745,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She wondered o'er his face, she looked her fill,"
746,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Museful, still doubting, smiling half, athrill,"
747,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"All virgin to his praise. ""O wonderful,"""
748,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She said, ""Such store of love for one so foul"
749,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"As I am now!"""
750,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"O fatal hot-and-cold,"
751,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"O love, whose iris wings not long can hold"
752,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,The upper air! Sudden her thought smote hot
753,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"On him. ""Thou sayest! True it is, God wot!"
754,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Warm from his bed, and tears for thy unworth;"
755,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Warm from his bed, and tears to meet my mirth;"
756,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Then back to his bed ere yet thy tears be dry!"""
757,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She heard not, but she knew his agony"
758,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Of burning vision, and kept back her tears"
759,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Until his pity moved in tune with hers
760,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Towards herself. But he from thunderous brows
761,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Frowned on. ""No more I see thee by this house,"
762,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Except to slay thee when the hour decree
763,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,An end to this vile nest of cuckoldry
764,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And holy vows made hateful, save thou speak"
765,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,To each my question sooth. Keep dry thy cheek
766,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"From tears, hide up thy beauty with thy grief--"
767,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Or let him have his joy of them, thy thief,"
768,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"What time he may. Answer me thou, or vain"
769,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Till thine hour strike to look for me again."""
770,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"With hanging head and quiet hanging hands,"
771,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"With lip atremble, as caught in fault she stands,"
772,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Scarce might he hear her whispered message:
773,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""Ask,"
774,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Lord, and I answer thee."""
775,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Strung to his task:
776,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""Tell me now all,"" he said, ""from that far day"
777,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Whenas embracing thee, I stood to pray,"
778,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And poured forth wine unto the thirsty earth
779,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"To Zeus and to Poseidon, in whose girth"
780,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Lie sea and land; to Gaia next, their spouse,"
781,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And next to Heré, mistress of my house,"
782,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Traitress, and thine, for grace upon my faring:"
783,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"For thou wert by to hear me, false arm bearing"
784,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Upon my shoulder, glowing, lying cheek"
785,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Next unto mine. Ay, and thou prayedst, with meek"
786,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Fair seeming, prosperous send-off and return."
787,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Tell me what then, tell all, and let me learn"
788,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,With what pretence that dog-souled slaked his thirst
789,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"In thy sweet liquor. Tell me that the first."""
790,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Then Helen lifted up her head, and beamed"
791,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Clear light upon him from her eyes, which seemed"
792,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"That blue which, lying on the white sea-bed"
793,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And gazing up, the sunbeam overhead"
794,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Would show, with green entinctured, and the warp"
795,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Inwoven of golden shafts, blended yet sharp;"
796,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,So that a glory mild and radiant
797,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Transfigured them. Upon him fell aslant
798,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"That lovely light, while in her cheeks the hue"
799,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Of throbbing dawn came sudden. So he knew
800,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Her best before she spoke; for when she spoke
801,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,It was as if the nightingale should croak
802,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"In April midst the first young leaves, so bleak,"
803,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"So harsh she schooled her throat, that it should speak"
804,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Dry matter and hard logic--as if she
805,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Were careful lest self-pity urged a plea
806,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Which was not hers to make; or as one faint
807,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And desperate lays down all his argument
808,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Like bricks upon a field, let who will make"
809,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,A house of them; so drily Helen spake
810,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"With a flat voice. ""Thou hadst been nine days gone,"
811,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Came my lord Alexandros, Priam's son,"
812,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And hailed me in the hall whereas I sat,"
813,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And claimed his guest-right, which not wondering at"
814,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,I gave as fitting was. Then came the day
815,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"I was beguiled. What more is there to say?"""
816,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Fixt on her fingers playing on the wall
817,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Her eyes were. But the King said: ""Tell me all."
818,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Thou wert beguiled: by his desire beguiled,"
819,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Or by thine own?"" She shook her head and smiled"
820,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Most sadly, pitying herself. ""Who knoweth"
821,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"The ways of Love, whence cometh, whither goeth"
822,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"The heart's low whimper? This I know, he loved"
823,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Me then, and pleasured only where I moved"
824,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,About the house. And I had pleasure too
825,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,To know of me he had it. Then we knew
826,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,The day at hand when he must take the road
827,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And leave me; and its eve we close abode
828,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Within the house, and spake not. But I wept."""
829,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She stayed, and whispering down her next word crept:"
830,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""I was beguiled, beguiled."" And then her lip"
831,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She bit, and rueful showed her partnership"
832,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,In sinful dealing.
833,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"But he, in his esteem"
834,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Bleeding and raw, urged on. ""To Kranai's deme"
835,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"He took thee then?"""
836,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Speechless she bent her head
837,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Towards her tender breasts whereon, soft shed"
838,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"As upon low quiet hills, the dawn light played,"
839,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And limned their gentle curves or sank in shade.
840,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"So gazing, stood she silent, but the King"
841,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Urged on. ""From thence to Ilios, thou willing,"
842,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"He took thee?"""
843,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Then, ""I was beguiled,"" again"
844,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She said; and he, who felt a worthier strain"
845,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Stir in his gall compassion, and uplift"
846,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Him out of knowledge, saw a blessed rift"
847,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Upon his dark horizon, as tow'rds night"
848,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,The low clouds break and shafted shows the light.
849,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""Ten years beguiled!"" he said, ""but now it seems"
850,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Thou art----"" She shook her head. ""Nay, now come dreams;"
851,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Nay, now I think, remember, now I see."""
852,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""What callest thou to mind?"" ""Hermione,"""
853,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"She said, ""our child, and Sparta my own land,"
854,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And all the honour that lay to my hand
855,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Had I but chosen it, as now I would""--"
856,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"And sudden hid her face up in her hood,"
857,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Her courage ebbed in grief, all hardness drowned"
858,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,In bitter weeping.
859,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Noble pity crowned
860,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,The greater man in him; so for a space
861,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"They wept together, she for loss; for grace"
862,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Of gain wept he. ""No more,"" he said, ""my sweet,"
863,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Tell me no more."""
864,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"""Ah, hear the whole of it"
865,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Before my hour is gone,"" she cried. But he"
866,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Groaning, ""I dare not stay here lest I see"
867,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Him take thee again."""
868,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Both hands to fold her breast,"
869,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,She shook her head; like as the sun through mist
870,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Shone triumph in her eyes. ""Have no more fear"
871,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Of him or any----"" Then, hearing a stir"
872,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,"Within the house, her finger toucht her lip,"
873,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And one fixt look she gave of fellowship
874,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,Assured--then turned and quickly went her way;
875,MENELAUS SPEAKS WITH HELEN,And his light vanisht with her for that day.

979,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Hath she no rarer bliss than all this sin,"
980,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Is she for dandling, kissing, hidden up"
981,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,For hungry hands to stroke or lips to sup?

1021,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"To know him craven, dog, not man, revealed"
1022,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"A panting drudge of lust, who held me here"
1023,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Caged vessel. Nay, come close. I loved him dear,"

1040,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Ere I had cast this pain on thee, and shame"
1041,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"On me, and wrought such outrage on our name."

1055,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Pinch in her flank, and hears the chaffer twist"
1056,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,This way and that for so much fat or lean--
1057,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Even so was I, a queen, child of a queen."""
1058,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"She bit her lip until the blood ran free,"
1059,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,And in her eyes he markt deep injury
1060,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Scald as the salt tears welled; but ""Listen yet,"""
1061,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"She said: ""Ye fought, and Paris fell beset"
1062,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Under thy spurning heel, yet felt no whit"
1063,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,The bitterness as I must come to it;
1064,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"For she, his Goddess, hid him up in mists"
1065,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,And brought him beat and broken from the lists
1066,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Here to his chamber. But I stood and burned,"
1067,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Shameful to be by one lost, by one earned,"
1068,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"A prize for games, a slave, a bandied thing--"
1069,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,Since as the oath was made so must I swing
1070,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"From bed to bed. But while I stood and wept,"
1071,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Melted in fruitless sorrow, up she crept"
1072,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"For me, his Goddess, gliding like a snake,"

1075,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Loathing him, I must go. He had his way,"
1076,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"As well he might who paid that goodly price,"
1077,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Honour, truth, courage, all, to have his vice:"
1078,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,The which forsook him when those fair things fled;
1079,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"For though my body hath lain in his bed,"
1080,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,My heart abhors it. And now in truth I wis
1081,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"My lord's true heart is where my own heart is,"
1082,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,The two together welded and made whole;
1083,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,And I will go to him and give my soul
1084,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"And shamed and faded body to his nod,"
1085,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"To spurn or take; and he shall be my God."""
1086,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Whereat made virgin, as all women are"

1088,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,Where all was soiled and seamed before the torch
1089,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Of Eros toucht the heart, and the keen scorch"
1090,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,Lickt up the foul misuse of vase so fair

1092,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,Leaned from the wall a fire-hued seraph's face
1093,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,And in one rapt long look gave and took Grace.
1094,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Deep in her eyes he saw the light divine,"
1095,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,Quick in him ran fierce joy of it like wine:

1097,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,Answers when men tell tidings from one crag
1098,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,"Unto another, and from peak to peak"
1099,THE APOLOGY OF HELEN,The good news flashes. Scarcely could he speak

1473,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Which you have loved too well."" His hand he rests"
1474,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Over one fair white bosom like a cup,"
1475,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"And leaning, of her lips his own must sup;"
1476,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"But she will not, but gently doth refuse it,"
1477,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Without a reason, save she doth not choose it."
1478,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Then when he flung away, she sat alone"
1479,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"And nursed her hope and sorrow, both in one"
1480,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Perturbéd bosom; and her fingers wove
1481,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,White webs as far afield her wits did rove
1482,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Perpending and perpending. So frail, so fair,"
1483,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"So faint she seemed, a wraith you had said there,"
1484,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"A woman dead, and not in lovely flesh."
1485,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,But all the while she writhed within the mesh
1486,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Of circumstance, and fiercely flamed her rage:"
1487,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"""O slave, O minion, thing kept in a cage"
1488,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"For this sleek master's handling!"" So she fumed"
1489,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"What time her wide eyes sought all ways, or loomed"
1490,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Like winter lakes dark in a field of snow,"
1491,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And still; nor lifted they their pall of woe
1492,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Responsive to her heart, nor flashed the thrill"
1493,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"That knew, which said, ""A true man loveth me still."""
1494,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,
1495,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"That same night, as she used, fair Helen went"
1496,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Among the suppliants in the hall, and lent"
1497,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"To each who craved the bounty of her grace,"
1498,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Her gentle touch on wounds, her pitiful face"
1499,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"To beaten eyes' dumb eloquence, that art"
1500,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"She above all could use, to stroke the heart"
1501,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And plead compassion in bestowing it.
1502,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,So with her handmaids busy did she flit
1503,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"From man to man, 'mid outlaws, broken blades,"
1504,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Robbed husbandmen, their robbers, phantoms, shades"
1505,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Of what were men till hunger made them less
1506,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Than man can be and still know uprightness;
1507,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And whom she spake with kindly words and cheer
1508,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,In him the light of hope began to peer
1509,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And glimmer in his eyes; and him she fed
1510,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"And nourisht, then sent homeward comforted"
1511,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"A little, to endure a little more."
1512,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Now among these, hard by the outer door,"
1513,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,She marked a man unbent whose sturdy look
1514,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Never left hers for long, whose shepherd's hook"
1515,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Seemed not a staff to prop him, whose bright eyes"
1516,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Burned steadily, as fire when the wind dies."
1517,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Great in the girth was he, but not so tall"
1518,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,By a full hand as many whom the wall
1519,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Showed like gaunt channel-posts by an ebb tide
1520,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Left stranded in a world of ooze. Beside
1521,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"His knees she kneeled, and to his wounded feet"
1522,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Applied her balms; but he, from his low seat"
1523,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Against the wall, leaned out and in her ear"
1524,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Whispered, but so that no one else could hear,"
1525,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"""Other than my wounds are there for thy pains,"
1526,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Lady, and deeper. One, a grievous, drains"
1527,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"The great heart of a king, and one is fresh,"
1528,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Though ten years old, in the sweet innocent flesh"
1529,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Of a young child."""
1530,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Nothing said she, but stoopt"
1531,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,The closer to her task. He thought she droopt
1532,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Her head, he knew she trembled, that her shoulder"
1533,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Twitcht as she wrought her task; so he grew bolder,"
1534,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Saying, ""But thou art pitiful! I know"
1535,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"That thou wilt wash their wounds."""
1536,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"She whispered ""Oh,"
1537,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Be sure of me!"""
1538,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Then he, ""Let us have speech"
1539,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Secret together out of range or reach
1540,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Of prying ears, if such a chance may be."""
1541,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Then she said, ""Towards morning look for me"
1542,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Here, when the city sleeps, before the sun."""
1543,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,So till the glimmer of dawn this hardy one
1544,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Keepeth the watch in Paris' house. All night
1545,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"With hard unwinking eyes he sat upright,"
1546,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"While all about the sleepers lay, like stones"
1547,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Littered upon a hill-top, save that moans,"
1548,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Sighings and ""Gods, have pity!"" showed that they"
1549,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"By night rehearsed the miseries of day,"
1550,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And by bread lived not but by hope deferred.
1551,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Grimly he suffered till such time he heard
1552,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Helen's light foot and faint and gray in the mist
1553,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Descried her slim veiled outline, saw her twist"
1554,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"And slip between the sleepers on the ground,"
1555,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Atiptoe coming, swift, with scarce a sound,"
1556,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Not faltering in fear. No fear she had.
1557,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,From head to foot a sea-blue mantle clad
1558,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Her lovely shape, from which her pale keen face"
1559,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Shone like the moon in frosty sky. No case
1560,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Was his to waver, for her eyes spake true"
1561,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,As Heaven upon the world. Him then she drew
1562,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"To follow her, out of the house, to where"
1563,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"The ilex trees stood darkly, and the air"
1564,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Struck sharp and chill before the dawn's first breath.
1565,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,There stood a little altar underneath
1566,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"An image: Artemis the quick deerslayer,"
1567,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,High-girdled and barekneed; to Whom in prayer
1568,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"First bowed, then stood erect with lifted hands,"
1569,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Palms upward, Helen. ""Lady of open lands"
1570,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"And lakes and windy heights,"" prayed she, ""so do"
1571,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,To me as to Amphion's wife when blew
1572,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"The wind of thy high anger, and she stared"
1573,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,On sudden death that not one dear life spared
1574,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Of all she had--so do to me if false
1575,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"I prove unto this Argive!"""
1576,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Then the walls

1578,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"And told him of the watch-towers, and how manned"
1579,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"The gates at night; and where the treasure was,"
1580,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And where the houses of the chiefs. But as
1581,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"She faltered in the tale, ""Show now,"" said he,"
1582,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"""Where Priam's golden palace is."""
1583,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,But she
1584,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Said, ""Nay, not that; for since the day of shame"
1585,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"That brought me in, no word or look of blame"
1586,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Hath he cast on me. Nay, when Hector died"
1587,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And all the city turned on me and cried
1588,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"My name, as to an outcast dog men fling"
1589,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Howling and scorn, not one word said the King."
1590,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"And when they hissed me in the shrines of the Gods,"
1591,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And women egged their children on with nods
1592,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"To foul the house-wall, or in passing spat"
1593,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Towards it, he, the old King, came and sat"
1594,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Daily with me, and often on my hair"
1595,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Would lay a gentle hand. Him thou shalt spare
1596,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"For my sake who betray him."""
1597,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Odysseus said,"
1598,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"""Well, thou shalt speak no more of him. His bed"
1599,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Is not of thy making, nor mine, but his"
1600,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Who hath thee here a cageling, thy Paris."
1601,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Him he begat as well as Hector. Now
1602,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Let Priam look to reap what he did sow."""
1603,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,But when glad light brimmed o'er the cup of earth
1604,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And shrill birds called forth men to grief or mirth
1605,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"As might afford their labour under the sun,"
1606,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Helen advised how best to get him gone,"
1607,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"And fetched a roll of cord, the which made fast"
1608,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"About a stanchion, about him next she cast,"
1609,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,About and about until the whole was round
1610,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"His body, and the end to his arm she bound:"
1611,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Then showed him in the wall where best foothold
1612,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"Might be, and watcht him down as fold by fold"
1613,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,He paid the cable out; and as he paid
1614,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,"So did she twist it, till the coil was made"
1615,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,As it had been at first. Then watcht she him
1616,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,Stride o'er the plain until he twinkled dim
1617,HELEN AND PARIS; ODYSSEUS AND HELEN,And sank into the mist.

1709,THEY BUILD THE HORSE AND ENTER IN,"They went with adzes and their smoothing tools,"
1710,THEY BUILD THE HORSE AND ENTER IN,And made all shapely; next bored for their dools
1711,THEY BUILD THE HORSE AND ENTER IN,"With augurs, and made good stock on to stock"

2037,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"She, though foredoomed she knew, held to her vows,"
2038,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,And duly paid the thankless evening rite--
2039,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,There came to Paris' house late in the night
2040,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"Deïphobus his brother, young and trim,"
2041,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"For speech with fair-tressed Helen, for whose slim"

2048,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"""For this,"" he says, ""is Troy's extremest hour."""
2049,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"But when to that she bowed her head, the power"
2050,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,Of his high vision made him vehement:
2051,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"""Dark sets the sun,"" he cried, ""and day is spent"";"
2052,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"But she said, ""Nay, the sun will rise with day,"

2054,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"""Thou lift up hands, bound down to a new lord!"""
2055,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"He mocked; then whispered, ""Lady, with a sword"

2057,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,Apart

2059,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"Shall loose me."""
2060,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"Then he said, ""Hear what I cry"

2062,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"Whereat she shook her head and sighed, ""Even so,"
2063,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"Brother, I fly where thou canst never go."
2064,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"Far go I, out of ken of thee and thy peers."""
2065,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,"He knew not what she would, but said, ""Thy fears"

2079,THE HORSE IN TROY; THE PASSION OF KASSANDRA,But now her heart was fain for rest; the night

2091,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,
2092,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Now Dawn came weeping forth, and on the crest"
2093,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Of Ida faced a chill wind from the West.
2094,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Forth from the gray sea wrack-laden it blew
2095,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And howled among the towers, and stronger grew"
2096,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,As crept unseen the sun his path of light.
2097,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Then she who in the temple all that night
2098,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Had kept her rueful watch, the prophetess"
2099,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Kassandra, peering sharply, heard the press"
2100,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And rush of flight above her, and with sick"
2101,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Foreboding waited; and the air grew thick
2102,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,With flying shapes immortal overhead.
2103,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"As in late Autumn, when the leaves are shed"
2104,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And dismal flit about the empty ways,"
2105,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And country folk provide against dark days,"
2106,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And heap the woodstack, and their stores repair,"
2107,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Attent you know the quickening of the air,"
2108,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And closer yet the swish and sweep and swing
2109,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Of wings innumerable, emulous to bring"
2110,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"The birds to broader skies and kindlier sun,"
2111,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And know indeed that winter is begun--
2112,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"So seeing first, then hearing, she knew the hour"
2113,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Was come when Troy must fall, and not a tower"
2114,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Be left to front the morrow. And she covered
2115,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Her head and mourned, while one by one they hovered"
2116,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Above their shrines, then flockt and faced the dawn."
2117,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,
2118,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"First, in her car of shell and amber, drawn"
2119,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"By clustering doves with burnisht wings, a-throng,"
2120,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Passes Queen Aphrodité, and her song"
2121,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Is sweet and sharp: ""I gave my sacred zone"

2123,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,That live by labour and in tears are born
2124,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And sighing go their ways, has e'er been worn."
2125,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"It kindled in thine eyes the lovelight, showed"
2126,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Thy burning self in his. Thy body glowed
2127,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,With beauty like to mine: mine thy love-laughter

2129,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Thy rapture of the morning, love renewed;"
2130,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And all the shadowed day to sit and brood
2131,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,On what has been and what should be again:
2132,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Thou wilt not? Nay, I proffer not in vain"
2133,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"My gifts, for I am all or will be nought."
2134,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Lo, where I am can be no other thought."""
2135,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Thus to the wooded heights of Ida she
2136,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Was drawn, hid in that pearly galaxy"
2137,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Of snow-white pigeons.
2138,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Next upon the height
2139,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Of Pergamos uplift a beam of light
2140,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"That for its core enshrined a naked youth,"
2141,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Golden and fierce. She knew the God sans ruth,"
2142,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Him who had given woeful prescience to her,"
2143,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Apollo, once her lover and her wooer;"
2144,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Who stood as one stands glorying in his grace
2145,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And strength, full in the sun, though on her place"
2146,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Within the temple court no sun at all
2147,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Shone, nor as yet upon the topmost wall"
2148,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Was any tinge of him, but all showed gray"
2149,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And sodden in the wind and blown sea-spray.
2150,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Not to him dared she lift her voice in prayer,"
2151,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Nor scarce her eyes to see him.
2152,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,To him there
2153,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Came swift a spirit in shape of virgin slim,"
2154,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"With snooded hair and kirtle belted trim,"
2155,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Short to the knee; and in her face the gale
2156,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Had blown bright sanguine colour. Free and hale
2157,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,She was; and in her hand she held a bow
2158,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Unstrung, and o'er her shoulders there did go"
2159,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,A baldrick that made sharp the cleft betwixt
2160,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Her sudden breasts--to that a quiver fixt,"
2161,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Showing gold arrow-points. No God there is
2162,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"In Heaven more swift than Delian Artemis,"
2163,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"The young, the pure health-giver of the Earth,"
2164,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Who loveth all things born, and brings to birth,"
2165,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And after slays with merciful sudden death--
2166,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"In whom is gladness all and wholesome breath,"
2167,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And to whom all the praise of him who writes,"
2168,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Ever.
2169,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,These two she saw like meteorites
2170,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Flare down the wind and burn afar, then fade."
2171,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And Leto next, a mother grave and staid,"
2172,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Drave out her chariot, which two winged stags drew,"
2173,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Swift following, robed in gown of inky blue,"
2174,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And hooded; and her hand which held the hood
2175,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Gleamed like a patch of snow left in a wood
2176,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Where hyacinths bring down to earth the sky.
2177,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And in her wake a winging company,"
2178,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Dense as the cloud of gulls which from a rock
2179,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"At sea lifts up in myriads, if the knock"
2180,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Of oars assail their peace, she saw, and mourned"
2181,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"The household gods. For outward they too turned,"
2182,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"The spirits of the streams and water-brooks,"
2183,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And nymphs who haunt the pastures, or in nooks"
2184,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Of woodlands dwell. There like a lag of geese
2185,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Flew in long straying lines the Oreades
2186,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,That in wild dunes and commons have their haunt;
2187,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"There sped the Hamadryads; there aslant,"
2188,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"As from the sea, but wheeling ere they crost"
2189,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Their sisters, thronged the river-nymphs, a host;"
2190,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And now the Gods of homestead and the hearth,"
2191,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Like sad-faced mourning women, left the garth"
2192,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Where each had dwelt since Troy was stablishéd,"
2193,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And been the holy influence over bed
2194,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And board and daily work under the sun
2195,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And nightlong slumber when day's work was done:
2196,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"They rose, and like a driven mist of rain"
2197,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Forsook the doomed high city and the plain,"
2198,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And drifted eastaway; and as they went
2199,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Heaviness spread o'er Ilios like a tent,"
2200,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And past not off, but brooded all day long."
2201,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,
2202,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,But ever coursed new spirits to the throng
2203,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"That packt the ways of Heaven. From the plain,"
2204,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,From mere and holt and hollow rose amain
2205,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,The haunters of the silence; from the streams
2206,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And wells of water, from the country demes,"
2207,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"From plough and pasture, bottom, ridge and crest"
2208,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,The rustic Gods rose up and joined the rest.
2209,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Like a long wisp of cloud from out his banks
2210,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Streamed Xanthos, that swift river, to the ranks"
2211,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Of flying shapes; and driven by that same mind
2212,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"That urged him to it came Simoeis behind,"
2213,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And other Gods and other, of stream and tree"
2214,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And hill and vale--for nothing there can be
2215,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"On earth or under Heaven, but hath in it"
2216,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Essence whereby alone its form may hit
2217,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Our apprehension, channelled in the sense"
2218,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Which feedeth us, that we through vision dense"
2219,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"See Gods as trees walking, or in the wind"
2220,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,That singeth in the bents guess what's behind
2221,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Its wailing music.
2222,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And now the unearthly flock,"
2223,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Emptying every water, wood, bare rock"
2224,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And pasture, beset Ida, and their wings"
2225,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Beat o'er the forest which about her springs
2226,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And makes a sea of verdure, whence she lifts"
2227,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Her soaring peaks to bathe them in the drifts
2228,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Of cloud, and rare reveal them unto men--"
2229,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"For Zeus there hath his dwelling, out of ken"
2230,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Of men alike and gods. But now the brows,"
2231,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"The breasting summits, still eternal snows,"
2232,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And all the faces of the mountain held
2233,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,A concourse like in number to the field
2234,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Of Heaven upon some breathless summer night
2235,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Printed with myriad stars, some burning bright,"
2236,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Some massed in galaxy, a cloudy scar,"
2237,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And others faint, as infinitely far."
2238,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"There rankt the Gods of Heaven, Earth, and Sea,"
2239,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Brethren of them now hastening from the fee
2240,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Of stricken Priam. Out of his deep cloud
2241,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Zeus flamed his levin, and his thunder loud"
2242,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Volleyed his welcome. With uplifted hands
2243,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Acclaiming, God's oncoming each God stands"
2244,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,To greet. And thus the Hierarchy at one
2245,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Sits to behold the bitter business done
2246,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Which Paris by his luxury bestirred.
2247,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,
2248,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"But in the city, like a stricken bird"
2249,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Grieving her desolation and despair,"
2250,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"As voiceless and as lustreless, astare"
2251,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"For imminent Death, Kassandra croucht beneath"
2252,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Her very doom, herself the bride of Death;"
2253,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,For in the temple's forecourt reared the mass
2254,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Of that which was to bring the woe to pass,"
2255,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And hidden in him both her murderers
2256,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Wrung at their nails.
2257,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And slow the long day wears
2258,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"While all the city broods. The chiefs keep house,"
2259,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Or gather on the wall, or make carouse"
2260,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,To simulate a freedom they feel not;
2261,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And at street corners men in shift or plot
2262,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Whisper together, or in the market-place"
2263,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Gather, and peer each other in the face"
2264,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Furtively, seeking comfort against care;"
2265,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Whose eyes, meeting by chance, shift otherwhere"
2266,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"In haste. But in the houses, behind doors"
2267,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Shuttered and barred, the women scrub their floors,"
2268,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Or ply their looms as busily: for they
2269,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Ever cure care with care, and if a day"
2270,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Be heavy lighten it with heavier task;
2271,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And for their griefs wear beauty like a mask,"
2272,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And answer heart's presaging with a song
2273,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"On their brave lips, and render right for wrong."
2274,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Little, by outward seeming, do they know"
2275,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Of doom at hand, of fate or blood or woe,"
2276,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Nor how their children, playing by their knees,"
2277,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Must end this day of busyness-at-ease
2278,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"In shrieking night, with clamour for their bread,"
2279,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And a red bath, and a cold stone for a bed"
2280,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Under the staring moon.
2281,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,
2282,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Now sinks the sun
2283,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Blood-red into the heavy sea and dun,"
2284,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And forth from him, as he were stuck with swords,"
2285,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Great streams of light go upward. Then the lords
2286,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Of havoc and unrest prepare their storms,"
2287,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And o'er the silent city, vulture forms--"
2288,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Eris and Enyo, Alké, Ioké,"
2289,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"The biter, the sharp-bitten, the mad, the fey--"
2290,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Hover and light on pinnacle and tower:
2291,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"The gray Erinnyes, watchful for the hour"
2292,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,When Haro be the wail. And down the sky
2293,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Like a white squall flung Até with a cry
2294,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"That sounded like the wind in a ship's shrouds,"
2295,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,As shrill and wild at once. The driving clouds
2296,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Surging together, blotted out the sea,"
2297,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"The beachéd ships, the plain with mound and tree,"
2298,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"And slantwise came the sheeted rain, and fast"
2299,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,The darkness settled in. Kassandra cast
2300,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Her mantle o'er her head, and with slow feet"
2301,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Entered her shrine deserted, there to greet"
2302,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Her fate when it should come; and merciful Sleep
2303,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Befriended her.
2304,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Now from his lair did creep
2305,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Odysseus forth unarmed, his sword and spear"
2306,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"There in the Horse, and warily to peer"
2307,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,And spy his whereabouts the Ithacan
2308,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,"Went doubtful. Then his dreadful work began,"
2309,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,As down the bare way of steep Pergamos
2310,THE GODS FORSAKE TROY,Under the dark he sought for Paris' house.

2318,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Unresting, with bright eyes and straining ears,"
2319,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Nor ever stayed her steps; but first the hall
2320,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"She ranged, touching the pillars; next to the wall"
2321,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Went out and shot her gaze into the murk
2322,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Whereas the ships should lie; then to her work
2323,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Upon the great loom turned and wove a shift,"
2324,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"But idly, waiting always for some lift"
2325,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,In the close-wrapping fog that might discover
2326,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"The moving hosts, the spearmen of her lover--"
2327,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Lover and husband, master and lord of life,"
2328,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Coming at last to take a slave to wife.
2329,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,And as wide-eyed she stared to feel her heart
2330,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Leap to her side, she felt the warm tears start,"
2331,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,And thankt the Goddess for the balm they brought.
2332,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Yet to her women, withal so highly wrought"
2333,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"By hope and care and waiting, she was mild"
2334,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"And gentle-voiced, and playful as a child"
2335,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"That sups the moment's joy, and nothing heeds"
2336,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Time past or time to come, but fills all needs"
2337,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"With present kindness. She would laugh and talk,"
2338,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Take arms, suffer embraces, even walk"
2339,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"The terrace 'neath the eyes of all her fate,"
2340,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"And seem to heed what they might show or prate,"
2341,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,As if her whole heart's heart were in this house
2342,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,And not at fearful odds and perilous.
2343,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"And should one speak of Paris, as to say,"
2344,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"""Would that our lord might see thee go so gay"
2345,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"About his house!"" Gently she'd bend her head"
2346,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Down to her breast and pluck a vagrant thread
2347,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Forth from her tunic's hem, and looking wise,"
2348,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Gaze at her hand which on her bosom's rise
2349,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Lit like a butterfly and quivered there.
2350,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Now in the dusk, with Paris otherwhere"
2351,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"At council with the chieftains, into the hall"
2352,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"To Helen there, was come, adventuring all,"
2353,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Odysseus in the garb of countryman,"
2354,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"A herdsman from the hills, with stain of tan"
2355,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Upon his neck and arms, with staff and scrip,"
2356,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,And round each leg bound crosswise went a strip
2357,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Of good oxhide. Within the porch he came
2358,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"And louted low, and hailed her by her name,"
2359,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Among her maidens easy to be known,"
2360,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Though not so tall as most, and not full blown"
2361,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,To shape and flush like a full-hearted rose;
2362,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,But like a summer wave her bosom flows
2363,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Lax and most gentle, and her tired sweet face"
2364,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Seems pious as the moon in a blue space
2365,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Of starless heaven, and in her eyes the hue"
2366,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Of early morning, gray through mist of blue."
2367,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Not by a flaunted beauty is she guessed
2368,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Queen of them all, but by the right expressed"
2369,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"In her calm gaze and fearless, and that hold"
2370,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Upon her lips which Gods have. Nay, not cold,"
2371,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Thou holy one, not cold thy lips, which say"
2372,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"All in a sigh, and with one word betray"
2373,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,The passion of thy heart! But who can wis
2374,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,The fainting piercing message of thy kiss?
2375,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,O blest initiate--let him live to tell
2376,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Thy godhead, show himself thy miracle!"
2377,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,But when she saw him there with his head bowed
2378,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"And humble hands, deeply her fair face glowed,"
2379,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,And broad across the iris swam the black
2380,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Until her eyes showed darkling. ""Friend, your lack"
2381,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Tell me,"" she said, ""and what is mine to give"
2382,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Is yours; but little my prerogative
2383,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Here in this house, where I am not the queen"
2384,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"You call me, but another name, I ween,"
2385,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Serves me about the country you are of,"
2386,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Which Ilios gives me too, but not in love."
2387,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Yet are we all alike in evil plight,"
2388,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"And should be tender of each other's right,"
2389,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"And of each other's wrongdoing, and wrongs done"
2390,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Upon us. Have you wife and little one
2391,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Hungry at home? Have you a son afield?
2392,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Or do you mourn? Alas, I cannot wield"
2393,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"The sword you lack, nor bow nor spear afford"
2394,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"To serve...."""
2395,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"He said, ""Nay, you can sheathe the sword,"
2396,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Slack bowstring, and make spear a hunter's toy."
2397,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Lady, I come to end this war of Troy"
2398,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"In your good pleasure."""
2399,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,With her steady eyes
2400,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Unwinking fixt, ""Let you and me devise,"""
2401,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Said she, ""this happy end of bow and spear,"
2402,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,So shall we serve the land. You have my ear;
2403,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Speak then."""
2404,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"""But so,"" he said, ""these maidens have it."
2405,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"But we save Troy alone, or never save it."""
2406,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Turning she bid them leave her with a nod,"
2407,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,And they obeyed. Swift then and like a God
2408,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"She seemed, with bright all-knowing eyes and calm"
2409,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Gesture of high-held head, and open palm"
2410,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"To greet. ""Laertes' son, what news bringst thou?"""
2411,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"""Lady,"" he said, ""the best. The hour is now."
2412,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"We stand within the heaven-establisht walls,"
2413,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"We gird the seat. Within an hour it falls,"
2414,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"The seat divine of Dardanos and Tros,"
2415,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,After our ten years' travail and great loss
2416,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Of heroes not yet rested, but to rest"
2417,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Soon."""
2418,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Then she laid her hand upon her breast
2419,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"To stay it. ""Who are ye that stand here-by?"""
2420,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"""Desperate men,"" he said, ""prepared to die"
2421,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,If thou wilt have it so. Chief is there none
2422,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Beside the ships but Nestor. All are gone
2423,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Forth in the Horse. Under thy covering hand
2424,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Thou holdest all Achaia. Here we stand,"
2425,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Epeios, Pyrrhos, Antiklos, with these"
2426,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Cretan Idomeneus, Meriones,"
2427,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Aias the Lokrian, Teukros, Diomede"

2433,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"To end or mend, to make or mar at will."""
2434,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"A weighty utterance, but she heard the thrill"
2435,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Within her heart, and listened only that--"
2436,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,To know her love so near. So near he sat
2437,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Hidden when she that toucht the Horse's flank
2438,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Could have toucht him! ""Odysseus!"" her voice sank"
2439,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,To the low tone of the soft murmuring dove

2446,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"By garish day had been our house of dream,"
2447,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,And our necks too. I heard a woman scream
2448,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Near by and cry upon the Ruinous Face,"
2449,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"But none made answer to her."""
2450,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Nought she says

2462,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,The light died out; a mask
2463,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Of panic was her face, what time her task"
2464,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,Stared on a field of white horror like blood:

2473,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Besought him, but her voice made no demands,"
2474,ODYSSEUS COMES AGAIN TO PARIS' HOUSE,"Only her haunted eyes were quick, and prayed,"

2597,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS
2598,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,
2599,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Now Paris tipt her chin and turned her face
2600,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Upwards to his that fondly he might trace
2601,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The beauty of her budded lips, and stoop"
2602,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And kiss them softly; and fingered in the loop
2603,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"That held her girdle, and closer pressed, on fire,"
2604,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Towards her; for her words had stung desire
2605,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Anew; and wooing in his fond boy's way,"
2606,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Whispered and lookt his passion; then to pray
2607,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Began: ""Ah, love, long strange to me, behold"
2608,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Thy winter past, and come the days of gold"
2609,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And pleasance of the spring! For in thine eyes
2610,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,I see his light and hail him as he flies!
2611,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Nay, cloud him not, nor veil him""--for she made"
2612,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"To turn her face, saying, ""Ah, let them fade:"
2613,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The soul thou prisonest here is grayer far."""
2614,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"But he would give no quarter now. ""O star,"
2615,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"O beacon-star, shine on me in the night"
2616,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"That I may wash me in thy bath of light,"
2617,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Taking my fill of thee; so cleanséd all
2618,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And healed, I rise renewed to front what call"
2619,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"May be!"" which said, with conquest in his bones"
2620,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And in his eyes assurance, in high tones"
2621,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"He called her maids, bade take her and prepare"
2622,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The couch, and her to be new-wedded there;"
2623,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,For long had they been strangers to their bliss.
2624,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,So by the altar standeth she submiss
2625,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And watchful, praying silent and intense"
2626,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"To a strange-figured Goddess, to his sense"
2627,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Who knew but Aphrodité. ""Love, what now?"
2628,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Who is thy God? What secret rite hast thou?"""
2629,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,For grave and stern above that altar stood
2630,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Heré the Queen of Heaven.
2631,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,In dry mood
2632,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"She answered him, ""Chaste wives to her do pray"
2633,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Before they couch, Blest be the strife! You say"
2634,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,We are to be new-wedded. Pour with me
2635,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Libation that we love not fruitlessly."""
2636,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"So said, she took the well-filled cup and poured,"
2637,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And prayed, saying, ""O Mother, not abhorred"
2638,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Be this my service of thee. Count it not
2639,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Offence, nor let my prayers be forgot"
2640,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,When reckoning comes of things done and not done
2641,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"By me thy child, or to me, hapless one,"
2642,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Unloving paramour and unloved wife!"""
2643,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"""Heré, to thee for issue of the strife!"""
2644,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Cried Paris then, and poured. So Helen went"
2645,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And let her maids adorn her to his bent.
2646,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,
2647,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Then took he joy of her, and little guessed"
2648,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Or cared what she might give or get. Possest
2649,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Her body by his body, but her mind"
2650,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Searcht terribly the issue. As one blind
2651,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Explores the dark about him in broad day
2652,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And fingers in the air, so as she lay"
2653,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Lax in his arms, her fainting eyes, aglaze"
2654,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"For terror coming, sought escape all ways."
2655,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Alas for her! What way for woman fair,"
2656,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Whose joy no fairer makes her than despair?
2657,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Her burning lips that kisses could not cool,"
2658,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Her beating heart that not love made so full,"
2659,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The surging of her breast, her clinging hands:"
2660,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Here are such signs as lover understands,"
2661,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"But fated Paris nowise. Her soul, distraught"
2662,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"To save him, proved the net where he was caught."
2663,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,For more she anguisht lest love be his bane
2664,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The fiercelier spurred she him, to make him fain"
2665,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Of that which had been ruinous to all.
2666,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,But all the household gathered on the wall
2667,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"While these two in discordant bed were plight,"
2668,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And watcht the Achaian fires. No beacon-light
2669,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Showed by the shore, but countless, flickering, streamed"
2670,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Innumerable lights, wove, dipt and gleamed"
2671,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Like fireflies on a night of summer heat,"
2672,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Withal one way they moved, though many beat"
2673,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Across and back, and mingled with the rest."
2674,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Anon a great glare kindled from the crest
2675,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Of Ida, and was answered by a blaze"
2676,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Behind the ships, which threw up in red haze"
2677,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Huge forms of prow and beak. Then from the Mound
2678,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Of Ilos fire shot up, from sacred ground,"
2679,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And out the mazy glory of moving lights
2680,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"One sped and flared, as of the meteorites"
2681,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"In autumn some fly further, brighter courses."
2682,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,A chariot! They heard the thunder of the horses;
2683,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And as they flew the torch left a bright wake.
2684,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And thus to one another woman spake,"
2685,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"""Lo, more lights race! They follow him, they near,"
2686,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Catch and draw level. Hark! Now you can hear
2687,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The tramp of men!"""
2688,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Says one, ""That baleful sheen"
2689,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Is light upon their spears. The Greeks, I ween,"
2690,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Are coming up to rescue or requite."""
2691,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"But then her mate: ""They mass, they fill the night"
2692,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"With panic terror."""
2693,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"True, that all night things"
2694,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Fled as they came. They heard the flickering wings
2695,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Of countless birds in haste, and as they flew"
2696,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,So fled the dark away. Light waxed and grew
2697,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Until the dead of night was vivified
2698,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And radiant opened out the countryside
2699,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"With pulsing flames of fire, which gleamed and glanced,"
2700,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Flickered, wavered, yet never stayed advance."
2701,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,As the sun rising high o'er Ida cold
2702,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Beats a sea-path in flakes of molten gold,"
2703,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,So stretcht from shore to Troy that litten stream
2704,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"That moved and shuddered, restless as a dream,"
2705,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Yet ever nearing, till on spear and shield"
2706,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"They saw light like the moon on a drowned field,"
2707,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And in the glare of torches saw and read
2708,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Gray faces, like the legions of the dead,"
2709,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Silent about the walls, and waiting there."
2710,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,But in the fragrant chamber Helen the fair
2711,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Lay close in arms, and Paris slept, his head"
2712,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Upon her bosom, deep as any dead."
2713,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,
2714,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Sudden there smote the blast of a great horn,"
2715,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Single, long-held and shuddering, and far-borne;"
2716,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And then a deathless silence. Paris stirred
2717,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"On that soft pillow, and listened while they heard"
2718,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Many men running frantically, with feet"
2719,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"That slapt the stones, and voices in the street"
2720,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Of question and call--""Oh, who are ye that run?"
2721,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"What of the night?"" ""O peace!"" And some lost one"
2722,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Wailed like a woman, and her a man did curse,"
2723,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And there were scuffling, prayers, and then worse--"
2724,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,A silence. But the running ended not
2725,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,While Paris lay alistening with a knot
2726,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Of Helen's loose hair twisting round his finger.
2727,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"""O love,"" he murmured low, ""I may not linger."
2728,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The street's awake. Alas, thou art too kind"
2729,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"To be a warrior's bride."" Sighing, she twined"
2730,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Her arm about his neck and toucht his face,"
2731,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And pressed it gently back to its warm place
2732,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Of pillowing. And Paris kissed her breast
2733,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And slept; but her heart's riot gave no rest
2734,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"As quaking there she lay, awaiting doom."
2735,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Then afar off rose clamour, and the room"
2736,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Was fanned with sudden light and sudden dark,"
2737,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,As on a summer night in a great park
2738,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Blazed forth you see each tuft of grass or mound,"
2739,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Anon the drowning blackness, while the sound"
2740,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Of Zeus's thunder hardens every close:
2741,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"So here the chamber glared, then dipt, and rose"
2742,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"That far confuséd tumult, and now and then"
2743,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,The scurrying feet of passion-driven men.
2744,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Thrilling she waited with sick certainty
2745,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Of doom inexorable, while the struck city"
2746,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Fought its death-grapple, and the windy height"
2747,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Of Pergamos became a shambles. White
2748,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The holy shrines stared on a field of blood,"
2749,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And with blank eyes the emptied temples stood
2750,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"While murder raved before them, and below"
2751,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And all about the city ran the woe
2752,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Of women for their children. Then the flame
2753,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Burst in the citadel, and overcame"
2754,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The darkness, and the time seemed of broad day."
2755,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And Helen stared unwinking where she lay
2756,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Pillowing Paris.
2757,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Now glad and long and shrill
2758,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,The second trumpet sounds. They have the hill--
2759,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"High Troy is down, is down! Starting, he wakes"
2760,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And turns him in her arms. His face she takes
2761,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,In her two hands and turns it up to hers.
2762,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Nothing she says, nothing she does, nor stirs"
2763,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"From her still scrutiny, nor so much as blinks"
2764,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Her eyes, deep-searching, of whose blue he drinks,"
2765,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And fond believes her all his own, while she"
2766,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Marvels that aught of his she e'er could be
2767,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,In times bygone. But now he is on fire
2768,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Again, and urges on her his desire,"
2769,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And loses all the sense of present needs
2770,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"For him in burning Troy, where Priam bleeds"
2771,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Head-smitten, trodden on his palace-floor,"
2772,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And white Kassandra yieldeth up her flower
2773,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"To Aias' lust, and of the Dardan race"
2774,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Survive he only, renegade disgrace,"
2775,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,He only and Aineias the wise prince.
2776,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,But now is crying fear abroad and wins
2777,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,The very household of the shameful lover;
2778,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Now are the streets alive, for worse in cover"
2779,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Like a trapt rat to die than fight the odds
2780,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Under the sky. Now women shriek to the Gods,"
2781,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And men run witlessly, and in and out"
2782,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The Greeks press, burning, slaying, and the rout"
2783,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Screameth to Heaven. As at sea the mews
2784,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Pack, their wings battling, when some fresh wrack strews"
2785,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"The tideway, and in greater haste to stop"
2786,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Others from prey, will let their morsel drop,"
2787,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And all the while make harsh lament--so here
2788,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,The avid spoilers bickered in their fear
2789,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"To be man[oe]uvred out of robbery,"
2790,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And tore the spoil, and mangled shamefully"
2791,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Bodies of men to strip them, and in haste"
2792,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,To forestall ravishers left the victims chaste.
2793,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Ares, the yelling God, and Até white"
2794,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Swept like a snow-storm over Troy that night;
2795,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And towers rockt, and in the naked glare"
2796,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Of fire the smoke climbed to the upper air;
2797,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And clamour was as of the dead broke loose.
2798,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"But Menelaus his stern way pursues,"
2799,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And to the wicked house with chosen band
2800,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Cometh, his good sword naked in his hand;"
2801,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And now, while Paris loves and holds her fast"
2802,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"In arms, the third horn sounds a shattering blast,"
2803,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Long-held, triumphant; and about the door"
2804,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Gathers the household, to cry, to pray, to implore,"
2805,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And at the last break in and scream the truth--
2806,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"""The Greeks! The Greeks! Save yourselves!"""
2807,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Then in sooth
2808,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Starts Paris out of bed, and as he goes"
2809,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Sees in the eyes of Helen all she knows
2810,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,And all believes; and with his utter loss
2811,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Of her rises the man in him that was
2812,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Ere luxury had entered blood and bone
2813,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Of him. No word he said, but let one groan,"
2814,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"And turned his dying eyes to hers, and read"
2815,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Therein his fate, that to her he was dead,"
2816,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Long dead and cold in grave. Whereat he past
2817,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Out of the door, and met his end at last"
2818,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"As man, not minion."
2819,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,But the woman fair
2820,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Lay on her face, half buried in her hair,"
2821,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,"Naked and prone beneath her saving sin,"
2822,THE BEGUILING OF PARIS,Not yet enheartened new life to begin.

2944,I,"The one to need, the one to give"
2945,I,"(As women must if they would live,"
2946,I,Who substance win by waste of self
2947,I,And only spend to hoard their pelf:
2948,I,"""O heart, take all of mine!"" ""O heart,"
2949,I,That which thou tak'st of thee is part--
2950,I,"No robbery therefore: mine is thine,"
2951,I,"Take then!""): so she and Proserpine"
2952,I,"Intercommunion'd each bright day,"
2953,I,And when night fell together lay
2954,I,"Cradled in arms, or cheek to cheek"
2955,I,Whispered the darkness out. Thou meek
2956,I,And gentle vision! let me tell
2957,I,Thy beauties o'er I love so well:
2958,I,"Thy sweet low bosom's rise and fall,"
2959,I,Pulsing thy heart's clear madrigal;
2960,I,Or how the blue beam from thine eyes
2961,I,Imageth all love's urgencies;
2962,I,"Thy lips' frail fragrance, as of flowers"
2963,I,Remembered in penurious hours
2964,I,"Of winter-exile; of thy brow,"
2965,I,Not written as thy breast of snow
2966,I,"With love's faint charact'ry, for his wing"
2967,I,Leaves not the heart long! Last I sing
2968,I,"Thy thin quick fingers, in whose pleaching"
2969,I,"Lieth all healing, all good teaching--"
2970,I,"Wherewith, touching my discontent,"
2971,I,I know how thou art eloquent!
2972,I,"Remember'd joy, Hypsipyle!"
2973,I,"Now may that serve to comfort me,"
2974,I,"While I, O Maiden dedicate,"
2975,I,Seek voice for singing thy gray Fate!
2976,I,
2977,I,"Now, as they went, one heart in two,"
2978,I,"Brusht to the knees by flowers, by dew"
2979,I,"Anointed, by the wind caressed,"
2980,I,"By the light kissed on eyes and breast,"
2981,I,'Twas Koré talked; Hypsipyle
2982,I,"Listened, with eyes far-set, for she"
2983,I,"Of speech was frugal, voicing low"
2984,I,And rare her heart's deep underflow--
2985,I,"Content to lie, like fallow sweet"
2986,I,"For rain or sun to cherish it,"
2987,I,Or scattered seed substance to find
2988,I,"In her deep-funded, quiet mind."
2989,I,"And thus the Goddess: ""Blest art thou,"
2990,I,"Hypsipyle, who canst not know"
2991,I,Until the hour strikes what must come
2992,I,To pass! But I foresee the doom
2993,I,And stay to meet it. Even here
2994,I,"The place, and now the hour!"" Then fear"
2995,I,"Took her who spake so fearless, cold"
2996,I,Threaded her thronging veins--behold!
2997,I,A hand on either shoulder stirs
2998,I,"That slim, sweet body close to hers,"
2999,I,"And need fires need till, lip with lip,"
3000,I,"They seal and sign their fellowship,"
3001,I,"While Koré, godhead all forgot,"
3002,I,"Clings whispering, ""Child, leave me not"
3003,I,Whenas to darkness and the dead
3004,I,"I go!"" And clear the answer sped"
3005,I,"From warm mouth murmuring kiss and cheer,"
3006,I,"""Never I leave thee, O my dear!"""
3007,I,"Thereafter stand they beatingly,"
3008,I,Not speaking; and the hour draws nigh.
3009,I,
3010,I,"And all the land shows passing fair,"
3011,I,"Fair the broad sea, the living air,"
3012,I,"The misty mountain-sides, the lake"
3013,I,Flecked blue and purple! To forsake
3014,I,"These, and those bright flower-gatherers"
3015,I,"Scattered about this land of theirs,"
3016,I,"That stoop or run, that kneel to pick,"
3017,I,That cry each other to come quick
3018,I,"And see new treasure, unseen yet!"
3019,I,"Remembered joy--ah, how forget!"
3020,I,
3021,I,But mark how all must come to pass
3022,I,As was foreknowledged. In the grass
3023,I,Whereas the Goddess and her mate
3024,I,"Stood, one and other, prompt for fate--"
3025,I,"Listless the first and heavy-eyed,"
3026,I,Astrain the second--she espied
3027,I,"That strange white flower, unseen before,"
3028,I,"With chalice pale, which thin stalk bore"
3029,I,"And swung, as hanging by a hair,"
3030,I,"So fine it seemed afloat in air,"
3031,I,Unlinkt and wafted for the feast
3032,I,"Of some blest mystic, without priest"
3033,I,Or acolyte to tender it:
3034,I,Whereto the maid did stoop and fit
3035,I,Her hand about its silken cup
3036,I,"To close it, that her mouth might sup"
3037,I,The honey-drop within. The bloom
3038,I,"Saw Koré then, and knew her doom"
3039,I,Foretold in it; and stood in trance
3040,I,Fixéd and still. No nigromance
3041,I,"Used she, but read the fate it bore"
3042,I,In seedless womb and petals frore.
3043,I,"Chill blew the wind, waiting stood She,"
3044,I,"Waiting her mate, Hypsipyle."
3045,I,
3046,I,Then in clear sky the thunder tolled
3047,I,"Sudden, and all the mountains rolled"
3048,I,"The dreadful summons round, and still"
3049,I,"Lay all the lands, only the rill"
3050,I,Made tinkling music. Once more drave
3051,I,Peal upon peal--and lo! a grave
3052,I,"Yawned in the Earth, and gushing smoke"
3053,I,"Belched out, as driven, and hung, and broke"
3054,I,With sullen puff; like tongues the flame
3055,I,"Leapt following. Thence Aïdoneus came,"
3056,I,"Swart-bearded king, with iron crown'd,"
3057,I,"In iron mailed, his chariot bound"
3058,I,"About with iron, holding back"
3059,I,Amain two steeds of glistering black
3060,I,"And eyeballs white-rimmed fearfully,"
3061,I,"And nostrils red, and crests flying free;"
3062,I,"Who held them pawing at the verge,"
3063,I,"Tossing their spume up, as the surge"
3064,I,Flung high against some seaward bluff.
3065,I,"Nothing he spake, or smooth or gruff,"
3066,I,"But drave his errand, gazing down"
3067,I,"Upon the Maid, whose blown back gown"
3068,I,Revealed her maiden. Still and proud
3069,I,"Stood she among her nymphs, unbowed"
3070,I,"Her comely head, undimmed her eye,"
3071,I,"Inseparate her lips and dry,"
3072,I,"Facing his challenge of her state,"
3073,I,"Neither denying, nor desperate,"
3074,I,"Pleading no mercy, seeing none,"
3075,I,Her wild heart masked in face of stone.
3076,I,"But they, her bevy, clustered thick"
3077,I,"As huddled sheep, set their eyes quick,"
3078,I,"And held each other, hand or waist,"
3079,I,Paling or flushing as fear raced
3080,I,"Thronging their veins--they knew not, they,"
3081,I,"The gathered fates that broke this day,"
3082,I,
3083,I,And all the land seemed passing fair
3084,I,"To one who knew, and waited there."
3085,I,
3086,I,"""Goddess and Maid,"" then said the King,"
3087,I,"""Long have I sought this day should bring"
3088,I,An end of torment. Know me thou
3089,I,"God postulant, with whom below"
3090,I,"A world awaits her queen, while here"
3091,I,I seek and find one without peer;
3092,I,Nor deem her heedless nor unschooled
3093,I,In what in Heaven is writ and ruled.
3094,I,"Decreed of old my bride-right was,"
3095,I,"Decreed thy Mother's pain and loss,"
3096,I,"Decreed thy loathing, and decreed"
3097,I,That which thou shunnest to be thy need;
3098,I,"For thou shalt love me, Lady, yet,"
3099,I,"Though little liking now, and fret"
3100,I,Of jealous care shall grave thy heart
3101,I,And draw thee back when time's to part--
3102,I,If fond Demeter have her will
3103,I,"Against thine own."""
3104,I,
3105,I,The Maid stood still
3106,I,"And guarded watched, and her proud eyes'"
3107,I,Scrutiny bade his own advise
3108,I,Whether indeed their solemn stare
3109,I,Saw Destiny and read it there
3110,I,"Beyond her suitor, or within"
3111,I,Her own heart heard the message ring.
3112,I,"Awhile she gazed: her stern aspect,"
3113,I,"Young and yet fraught with Godhead, checkt"
3114,I,"Both Him who claimed, and her who'd cling,"
3115,I,"And them who wondered. ""O great King,"""
3116,I,"She said, and mournful was her crying"
3117,I,"As when night-winds set pine-trees sighing,"
3118,I,"""King of the folk beyond the tide"
3119,I,"Of sleep, behold thy chosen bride"
3120,I,"Not shunning thee, nor seeking. Take"
3121,I,"That which Gods neither mar nor make,"
3122,I,"But only They, the Three, who spin"
3123,I,"The threads which hem and mesh us in,"
3124,I,"Both Gods and men, till she who peers"
3125,I,The longest cuts them with her shears.
3126,I,"Take, take, Aïdoneus, and take her,"
3127,I,"My fosterling."""
3128,I,"Then He, ""O star"
3129,I,"Of Earth, O Beacon of my days,"
3130,I,"Light of my nights, whose beamy rays"
3131,I,Shall pierce the foggy cerement
3132,I,Wherein my dead grope and lament
3133,I,"Beyond all loss the loss of light,"
3134,I,Come! and be pleasant in my sight
3135,I,This thy beloved. Perchance she too
3136,I,Shall find a suitor come to woo;
3137,I,For love men leave not with their bones--
3138,I,"That is the soul's, and half atones"
3139,I,"And half makes bitterer their loss,"
3140,I,"Remembering what their fortune was."""
3141,I,Trembling Hypsipyle uplift
3142,I,"Her eyes towards the hills, where swift"
3143,I,"The shadows flew, but no more fleet"
3144,I,Than often she with flying feet
3145,I,"And flying raiment, she with these"
3146,I,"Her mates, whom now estranged she sees--"
3147,I,As if the shadow-world had spread
3148,I,"About her now, and she was dead--"
3149,I,Her mates no more! cut off by fear
3150,I,From these two fearless ones. A tear
3151,I,"Welled up and hovered, hung a gem"
3152,I,"Upon her eyelid's dusky hem,"
3153,I,As raindrops linkt and strung arow
3154,I,Broider with stars the winter bough.
3155,I,This was her requiem and farewell
3156,I,"To them, thus rang she her own knell;"
3157,I,"Nor more gave she, nor more asked they,"
3158,I,But took and went the fairy way.
3159,I,For thus with unshed tears made blind
3160,I,Went she: thus go the fairy kind
3161,I,Whither fate driveth; not as we
3162,I,"Who fight with it, and deem us free"
3163,I,"Therefore, and after pine, or strain"
3164,I,Against our prison bars in vain.
3165,I,For to them Fate is Lord of Life
3166,I,"And Death, and idle is a strife"
3167,I,With such a master. They not know
3168,I,"Life past, life coming, but life now;"
3169,I,"Nor back look they to long, nor forth"
3170,I,"To hope, but sup the minute's worth"
3171,I,With draught so quick and keen that each
3172,I,Moment gives more than we could reach
3173,I,"In all our term of three-score years,"
3174,I,Whereof full score we give to fears
3175,I,"Of losing them, and other score"
3176,I,Dreaming how fill the twenty more.
3177,I,"Now is the hour, Bride of the Night!"
3178,I,"The chariot turns, the great steeds fight"
3179,I,The rocky entry; flies the dust
3180,I,Behind the wheels at each fierce thrust
3181,I,"Of giant shoulder, at each lunge"
3182,I,"Of giant haunch. Down, down they plunge"
3183,I,"Into the dark, with rioting mane,"
3184,I,And the earth's door shuts-to again.
3185,I,"Now fly, ye Oreads, strain your arms,"
3186,I,Let eyes and hair voice your alarms--
3187,I,"Hair blown back, mouths astretch for fear,"
3188,I,Strained eyeballs--cry that Mother dear
3189,I,Her daughter's rape; fly like the gale
3190,I,That down the valleys drives the hail
3191,I,"In scurrying sheets, and lays the corn"
3192,I,"Flat, which when man of woman born"
3193,I,"Seeth, he bows him to the grass,"
3194,I,"Whispering in hush, _The Oreads pass_."
3195,I,"(In shock he knows ye, and in mirth,"
3196,I,Since he is kindred of that earth
3197,I,"Which bore ye in her secret stress,"
3198,I,"Images of her loveliness,"
3199,I,To her dear paramour the Wind.)
3200,I,Follow me now that car behind.
3201,I,
3202,I,
3203,II,II
3204,II,
3205,II,"O ye that know the fairy throng,"
3206,II,And heed their secret under-song;
3207,II,In flower or leaf's still ecstasy
3208,II,"Of birth and bud their passion see,"
3209,II,"In wind or calm, in driving rain"
3210,II,Or frozen snow discern them strain
3211,II,To utter and to be; who lie
3212,II,At dawn in dewy brakes to spy
3213,II,The rapture of their flying feet--
3214,II,"Follow me now those coursers fleet,"
3215,II,"Sucked in their wake, down ruining"
3216,II,"Through channelled night, where only sing"
3217,II,The shrill gusts streaming through the hair
3218,II,"Of them who sway and bend them there,"
3219,II,And peer in vain with shielded eyes
3220,II,"To rend the dark. Clinging it lies,"
3221,II,Thick as wet gossamer that shrouds
3222,II,"October brushwoods, or low clouds"
3223,II,That from the mountain tops roll down
3224,II,"Into the lowland vales, to drown"
3225,II,Men's voices and to choke their breath
3226,II,And make a silence like to death.
3227,II,But this was hot and dry; it came
3228,II,"And smote them, like the gush of flame"
3229,II,"Fanned in a smithy, that outpours"
3230,II,And floods with fire the open doors.
3231,II,"Downward their course was, swift as flight"
3232,II,"Of meteor flaring through the night,"
3233,II,"Steady and dreadful, with no sound"
3234,II,"Of wheels or hoofs upon the ground,"
3235,II,"Nor jolt, nor jar; for once past through"
3236,II,"Earth's portals, steeds and chariot flew"
3237,II,On wings invisible and strong
3238,II,"And even-oaring, such as throng"
3239,II,The nights when birds of passage sweep
3240,II,O'er cities and the folk asleep:
3241,II,Such was their awful flight. Afar
3242,II,Showed Hades glimmering like a star
3243,II,Seen red through fog: and as they sped
3244,II,"To that, the frontiers of the dead"
3245,II,"Revealed their sullen leagues and bare,"
3246,II,"And sad forms flitting here and there,"
3247,II,"Or clustered, waiting who might come"
3248,II,Their empty ways with news of home.
3249,II,"Yet all one course at length must hold,"
3250,II,"Or late or soon, and all be tolled"
3251,II,By Charon in his dark-prowed boat.
3252,II,Thither was swept the chariot
3253,II,And crossed dry-wheeled the coiling flood
3254,II,"Of Styx, and o'er the willow wood"
3255,II,And slim gray poplars which do hem
3256,II,"The further shore, Hell's diadem--"
3257,II,So by the tower foursquare and great
3258,II,Where King Aïdoneus keeps his state
3259,II,And rules his bodyless thralls they stand.
3260,II,
3261,II,Dark ridge and hollow showed the land
3262,II,"Fold over fold, like waves of soot"
3263,II,Fixt in an anguish of pursuit
3264,II,"For evermore, so far as eye"
3265,II,Could range; and all was hot and dry
3266,II,As furnace is which all about
3267,II,"Etna scorcheth in days of drouth,"
3268,II,And showeth dun and sinister
3269,II,That fair isle linked to main so fair.
3270,II,"Nor tree nor herbage grew, nor sang"
3271,II,Water among the rocks: hard rang
3272,II,"The heel on metal, or on crust"
3273,II,"Grew tender, or went soft in dust;"
3274,II,Neither for beast nor bird nor snake
3275,II,Was harbourage; nor could such slake
3276,II,"Their thirst, nor from the bitter heat"
3277,II,"Hide, since the sun not furnished it;"
3278,II,"But airless, shadowless and dense"
3279,II,"The land lay swooning, dead to sense"
3280,II,"Beneath that vault of stuprous black,"
3281,II,"Motionless hanging, without wrack"
3282,II,"Of cloud to break and pass, nor rent"
3283,II,To hint the blue. Like the foul tent
3284,II,"A foul night makes, it sagged; for stars"
3285,II,"Showed hopeless faces, with two scars"
3286,II,"In each, their eyes' immortal woe,"
3287,II,Ever to seek and never know:
3288,II,In all that still immensity
3289,II,"These only moved--these and the sea,"
3290,II,"Which dun and sullen heaved, with surge"
3291,II,"And swell unseen, save at the verge"
3292,II,Where fainted off the black to gray
3293,II,And showed such light as on a day
3294,II,Of sun's eclipse men tremble at.
3295,II,
3296,II,"Here the dead people moved or sat,"
3297,II,"Casting no shadow, hailing none"
3298,II,Boldly; but in fierce undertone
3299,II,"They plied each other, or on-sped"
3300,II,Their way with signal of the head
3301,II,"For answer, or arms desperate"
3302,II,"Flung up, or shrug disconsolate."
3303,II,And this the quest of every one:
3304,II,"""What hope have ye?"" And answer, ""None."""
3305,II,Never passed shadow shadow but
3306,II,That answer got to question put.
3307,II,"In that they lived, in that, alas!"
3308,II,"Lovely and hapless, Thou must pass"
3309,II,"Thy days, with this for added lot--"
3310,II,"Aching, to nurse things unforgot."
3311,II,
3312,II,"Remember'd joy, Hypsipyle!"
3313,II,"The Oread choir, the Oread glee:"
3314,II,"The nimble air of quickening hills,"
3315,II,The sweet dawn light that floods and fills
3316,II,The hollowed valleys; the dawn wind
3317,II,"That bids the world wake, and on blind"
3318,II,Eyelids of sleeping mortals lays
3319,II,Cool palms that urge them see and praise
3320,II,The Day-God coming with the sun
3321,II,To hearten toil! He warned you run
3322,II,And hide your beauties deep in brake
3323,II,"Of fern or briar, or reed of lake,"
3324,II,"Or in wet crevice of the rock,"
3325,II,There to abide until the clock
3326,II,"You reckon by, with shadowy hands,"
3327,II,Lay benediction on the lands
3328,II,"And landsmen, and the eve-jar's croak"
3329,II,"Summon ye, lightfoot fairy folk,"
3330,II,To your activity full tide
3331,II,Over the empty earth and wide.
3332,II,"Here be your food, fair nymph, and coy"
3333,II,Of mortal ken--remember'd joy!
3334,II,
3335,II,"Remember'd joy! Ah, stormy nights,"
3336,II,"Ah, the mad revel when wind fights"
3337,II,"With wind, and slantwise comes the rain"
3338,II,"And shatters at the window-pane,"
3339,II,"To wake the hind, who little knows"
3340,II,"Whose fingers drum those passionate blows,"
3341,II,Nor what swift indwellers of air
3342,II,Ye be who hide in forms so fair
3343,II,"Your wayward motions, cruel to us,"
3344,II,"While lovely, and dispiteous!"
3345,II,"Ah, nights of flying scud and rout"
3346,II,When scared the slim young moon rides out
3347,II,"In her lagoon of open sky,"
3348,II,"Or older, marks your revelry"
3349,II,As calm and large she oars above
3350,II,Your drifting lives of ruth or love.
3351,II,Boon were those nights of dusted gold
3352,II,And glint of fireflies! Boon the cold
3353,II,"And witching frost! All's one, all's one"
3354,II,"To thee, whose nights and days go on"
3355,II,Now in one span of changeless dusk
3356,II,"On one earth, crackling like the husk"
3357,II,Of the dropt mast in winter wood:
3358,II,"Remember'd joy--'tis all thy food,"
3359,II,"Hypsipyle, to whose fond sprite"
3360,II,I vow my praise while I have light.
3361,II,
3362,II,"Dumbly she wandered there, as pale"
3363,II,"With lack of light, with form as frail"
3364,II,As those poor hollow congeners
3365,II,"Whose searching eyes encountered hers,"
3366,II,Petitioning as mute as she
3367,II,"Some grain of hope, where none might be,"
3368,II,Daring not yet to voice their moan
3369,II,To her whose case was not their own;
3370,II,For where they go like breath in a shell
3371,II,"That wails, my love goes quick in Hell."
3372,II,
3373,II,"Alas, for her, the sweet and slim!"
3374,II,Slowly she pines; her eyes grow dim
3375,II,"With seeking; her smooth, sudden breasts"
3376,II,Hang languidly; those little nests
3377,II,"For kisses which her dimples were,"
3378,II,In cheeks graved hollow now by care
3379,II,"Vanish, and sharply thrusts her chin,"
3380,II,And sharp her bones of arm and shin.
3381,II,"Reproach she looks, about, above,"
3382,II,"Denied her light, denied her love,"
3383,II,"Denied for what she sacrificed,"
3384,II,Doomed to be fruitless agonist.
3385,II,"(O God, and I must see her fade,"
3386,II,Must see and anguish--in my shade!)
3387,II,Nor help nor comfort gat she now
3388,II,From her whose need called forth her vow;
3389,II,For close in arms Queen Koré dwelt
3390,II,In that great tower Aïdoneus built
3391,II,"To cherish her; deep in his bed,"
3392,II,Loved as the Gods love whom they wed;
3393,II,"Turned from pale maiden to pale wife,"
3394,II,Pale now with love's insatiate strife
3395,II,"First to appease, and then renew"
3396,II,The wild desire to mingle two
3397,II,"Natures, to long, to seek, to shun,"
3398,II,"To have, to give, to make two one"
3399,II,That must be two if they would each
3400,II,Learn all the lore that love can teach.
3401,II,"So strove the mistress, while the maid"
3402,II,"Went alien among the dead,"
3403,II,"Unspoken, speaking none, but watcht"
3404,II,By them who knew themselves outmatcht
3405,II,"By her, translated whole, nor guessed"
3406,II,"What miseries gnawed within that breast,"
3407,II,"Which could be toucht, which could give meat"
3408,II,To babe; which was not eye-deceit
3409,II,"As theirs, poor phantoms. So went she"
3410,II,"Grudged but unscathed beside the sea,"
3411,II,Or sat alone by that sad strand
3412,II,Nursing her worn cheek in her hand;
3413,II,"And did not mark, as day on day"
3414,II,"Lengthened the arch of changeless gray,"
3415,II,"How she was shadowed, how to her"
3416,II,Stretcht arms another prisoner;
3417,II,Nor knew herself desirable
3418,II,By any thankless guest of Hell--
3419,II,Withal each phantom seemed no less
3420,II,Whole-natured to her heedlessness.
3421,II,
3422,II,Midway her round of solitude
3423,II,She used to haunt a dead sea-wood
3424,II,Where among boulders lifeless trees
3425,II,Stuck rigid fingers to the breeze--
3426,II,That stream of faint hot air that flits
3427,II,Aimless at noon. 'Tis there she sits
3428,II,"Hour after hour, and as a dove"
3429,II,"Croons when her breast is ripe for love,"
3430,II,"So sings this exile, quiet, sad chants"
3431,II,"Of love, yet knows not what she wants;"
3432,II,"And singing there in undertone,"
3433,II,Is one day answered by the moan
3434,II,Of hidden mourner; but no fear
3435,II,"Hath she for sound so true, though near;"
3436,II,"Nay, but sings out her elegy,"
3437,II,"Which, like an echo, answers he."
3438,II,"Again she sings; he suits her mood,"
3439,II,Nor breaks upon her solitude:
3440,II,"So she, choragus, calls the tune,"
3441,II,And as she leads he follows soon.
3442,II,"As bird with bird vies in the brake,"
3443,II,She sings no note he will not take--
3444,II,"As when she pleads, ""Ah, my lost love,"
3445,II,"The night is dark thou art not of,"""
3446,II,"Quick cometh answering the phrase,"
3447,II,"""O love, let all our nights be days!"""
3448,II,"This, rapt, with beating heart, she heeds"
3449,II,"And follows, ""Sweet love, my heart bleeds!"
3450,II,"Come, stay the wound thyself didst give"";"
3451,II,"Then he, ""I come to bid thee live."""
3452,II,"And so they carol, and her heart"
3453,II,"Swells to believe his counterpart,"
3454,II,"And strophé striketh clear, which he"
3455,II,Caps with his brave antistrophe;
3456,II,"And as a maiden waxes bold,"
3457,II,And opens what should not be told
3458,II,When all her auditory she sees
3459,II,"Within her mirror, so to trees"
3460,II,"And rocks, and sullen sounding main"
3461,II,She empties all her passioned pain;
3462,II,"And ""love, love, love,"" her burden is,"
3463,II,"And ""I am starving for thee,"" his."
3464,II,"Moved, melted, all on fire she stands,"
3465,II,"Holding abroad her quivering hands,"
3466,II,Raises her sweet eyes faint with tears
3467,II,And dares to seek him whom she hears;
3468,II,And from her parted lips a sigh
3469,II,"Stealeth, as knowing he is nigh"
3470,II,And her fate on her--then she'd shun
3471,II,That which she seeks; but the thing's done.
3472,II,
3473,II,"Hollow-voiced, dim, spake her a shade,"
3474,II,"""O thou that comest, nymph or maid--"
3475,II,"If nymph, then maiden, since for aye"
3476,II,"Virgin is immortality,"
3477,II,Nor love can change what Death cannot--
3478,II,Look on me by love new-begot;
3479,II,"Look on me, child new-born, nor start"
3480,II,To see my form who knowest my heart;
3481,II,"For it is thine. O Mother and Wife,"
3482,II,"Take then my love--thou gavest it life!"""
3483,II,
3484,II,So spake one close: to whom she lent
3485,II,The wonder of her eyes' content--
3486,II,"That lucent gray, as if moonlight"
3487,II,Shone through a sapphire in the night--
3488,II,"And saw him faintly imaged, rare"
3489,II,"As wisp of cloud on hillside bare,"
3490,II,"A filamental form, a wraith"
3491,II,Shaped like that man who in the faith
3492,II,Of one puts all his hope: who stood
3493,II,"Trembling in her near neighbourhood,"
3494,II,"A thing of haunted eyes, of slim"
3495,II,"And youthful seeming; yet not dim,"
3496,II,Yet not unmanly in his fashion
3497,II,"Of speech, nor impotent of passion--"
3498,II,The which his tones gave earnest of
3499,II,And his aspéct of hopeless love;
3500,II,"Who, drawing nearer, came to stand"
3501,II,So close beside her that one hand
3502,II,Lit on her shoulder--yet no touch
3503,II,"She felt: ""O maiden overmuch,"""
3504,II,"He grieved, ""O body far too sweet"
3505,II,"For such as I, frail counterfeit"
3506,II,"Of man, who yet was once a man,"
3507,II,Cut off before the midmost span
3508,II,"Of mortal life was but half run,"
3509,II,Or ere to love he had found one
3510,II,"Like thee--yet happy in that fate,"
3511,II,"That waiting, he is fortunate:"
3512,II,For better far in Hell to fare
3513,II,"With thee than commerce otherwhere,"
3514,II,Sharing the snug and fat outlook
3515,II,Of bed and board and ingle-nook
3516,II,"With earth-bound woman, earth-born child."
3517,II,"Nay, but high love is free and wild"
3518,II,And centreth not in mortal things;
3519,II,"But to the soul giveth he wings,"
3520,II,"And with the soul strikes partnership,"
3521,II,So may two let corruption slip
3522,II,"And breasting level, with far eyes"
3523,II,"Lifted, seek haven in the skies,"
3524,II,Untrammel'd by the earthly mesh.
3525,II,"O thou,"" said he, ""of fairy flesh,"
3526,II,"Immortal prisoner, take of me"
3527,II,Love! 'tis my heritage in fee;
3528,II,"For I am very part thereof,"
3529,II,"And share the godhead."""
3530,II,So his love
3531,II,Pled he with tones in love well-skilled
3532,II,"Which on her bosom beat and thrilled,"
3533,II,And pierced. No word nor look she had
3534,II,"To voice her heart, or sad or glad."
3535,II,"Rapt stood she, wooed by eager word"
3536,II,"And by her need, whose cry she heard"
3537,II,Above his crying; but she guessed
3538,II,"She was desired, beset, possessed"
3539,II,"Already, handfasted to sight,"
3540,II,"And yielding so, her heart she plight."
3541,II,
3542,II,Thus was her mating: of the eyes
3543,II,"And ears, and her love half surmise,"
3544,II,Detected by her burning face
3545,II,"Which saw, not felt, his fierce embrace."
3546,II,For on her own she knew no hand
3547,II,"When caging it he seemed to stand,"
3548,II,And round her waist felt not the warm
3549,II,Sheltered peace of the belting arm
3550,II,She saw him clasp withal. When rained
3551,II,"His words upon her, or eyes strained"
3552,II,As though her inmost shrine to pierce
3553,II,"Where hid her heart of hearts, her ears"
3554,II,"Conceived, although her body sweet"
3555,II,Might never feel a young life beat
3556,II,"And leap within it. Ah, what cry"
3557,II,That mistress e'er heard poet sigh
3558,II,Could voice thy beauty? Or what chant
3559,II,Of music be thy ministrant?
3560,II,"Since thou art Music, poesy"
3561,II,Must both thy spouse and increase be!
3562,II,
3563,II,"In the hot dust, where lizards crouch"
3564,II,"And pant, he made her bridal couch;"
3565,II,Thither down drew her to his side
3566,II,"And, phantom, taught her to be bride"
3567,II,"With words so ardent, looks so hot"
3568,II,"She needs must feel what she had not,"
3569,II,Guess herself in beleaguered bed
3570,II,And throb response. Thus she was wed.
3571,II,"As she whom Zeus loved in a cloud,"
3572,II,"So lay she in her lover's shroud,"
3573,II,And o'er her members crept the chill
3574,II,We know when mist creeps up a hill
3575,II,Out of the vale at eve. As grows
3576,II,"The ivy, rooting as it goes,"
3577,II,In such a quick close envelope
3578,II,"She lay aswoon, nor guessed the scope"
3579,II,"Nor tether of his hot intent,"
3580,II,"Nor what to that inert she lent,"
3581,II,Save when at last with half-turned head
3582,II,"And glimmering eyes, encompasséd"
3583,II,"She saw herself, a bride possest"
3584,II,"By ghostly bridegroom, held and prest"
3585,II,"To unfelt bosom, saw his mouth"
3586,II,"Against her own, which to his drouth"
3587,II,"Gave no allay that she could sense,"
3588,II,Nor took of her sweet recompense.
3589,II,"So moved by pity, stirred by rue,"
3590,II,Out of their onslaught young love grew.
3591,II,Love that with delicate tongues of fire
3592,II,Can kindle hearts inflamed desire
3593,II,In her for him who needed it;
3594,II,And so she claimed and by eyes' wit
3595,II,"Had what she would: and now made war,"
3596,II,"Being, as all sweet women are,"
3597,II,"Prudes till Love calls them, and then fierce"
3598,II,In love's high calling. Thus with her ears
3599,II,"She fed on love, and to her eyes"
3600,II,Lent deeds of passionate emprise--
3601,II,"Till at the last, the shadowy strife"
3602,II,"Ended, she owned herself all wife."
3603,II,
3604,II,"High mating of the mind! O love,"
3605,II,"Since this must be, on this she throve!"
3606,II,"Remember'd joy, Hypsipyle,"
3607,II,"Since this must be, O love, let be!"

3618,OREITHYIA,To stormy Thrace from Athens where you tarried
3619,OREITHYIA,Down by Ilissus all a blowy day
3620,OREITHYIA,"Among the asphodels, how rapt away"
3621,OREITHYIA,"Thither, and in what frozen bed wert married?"
3622,OREITHYIA,
3623,OREITHYIA,"""I was a King's tall daughter still unwed,"
3624,OREITHYIA,Slim and desirable my locks to shed
3625,OREITHYIA,Free from the fillet. He my maiden belt
3626,OREITHYIA,"Undid with busy fingers hid but felt,"
3627,OREITHYIA,And made me wife upon no marriage bed.
3628,OREITHYIA,
3629,OREITHYIA,"""As idly there I lay alone he came"
3630,OREITHYIA,"And blew upon my side, and beat a flame"
3631,OREITHYIA,"Into my cheeks, and kindled both my eyes."
3632,OREITHYIA,I suffered him who took no bodily guise:
3633,OREITHYIA,The light clouds know whether I was to blame.
3634,OREITHYIA,
3635,OREITHYIA,"""Into my mouth he blew an amorous breath;"
3636,OREITHYIA,"I panted, but lay still, as quiet as death."
3637,OREITHYIA,The whispering planes and sighing grasses know
3638,OREITHYIA,Whether it was the wind that loved me so:
3639,OREITHYIA,"I know not--only this, 'O love,' he saith,"
3640,OREITHYIA,
3641,OREITHYIA,"""'O long beset with love, and overloved,"
3642,OREITHYIA,"O easy saint, untempted and unproved,"
3643,OREITHYIA,"O walking stilly virgin ways in hiding,"
3644,OREITHYIA,"Come out, thou art too choice for such abiding!"
3645,OREITHYIA,She never valued ease who never roved.
3646,OREITHYIA,
3647,OREITHYIA,"""'Thou mayst not see thy lover, but he now"
3648,OREITHYIA,"Is here, and claimeth thy low moonlit brow,"
3649,OREITHYIA,"Thy wonderful eyes, and lips that part and pout,"
3650,OREITHYIA,And polished throat that like a flower shoots out
3651,OREITHYIA,From thy dark vesture folded and crossed low.'
3652,OREITHYIA,
3653,OREITHYIA,"""With that he had his way and went his way;"
3654,OREITHYIA,"For Gods have mastery, and a maiden's nay"
3655,OREITHYIA,Grows faint ere it is whispered all. I sped
3656,OREITHYIA,"Homeward with startled face and tiptoe tread,"
3657,OREITHYIA,"And up the stair, and in my chamber lay."
3658,OREITHYIA,
3659,OREITHYIA,"""Crouching I lay and quaked, and heard the wind"
3660,OREITHYIA,"Wail round the house like a mad thing confined,"
3661,OREITHYIA,And had no rest; turn wheresoe'er I would
3662,OREITHYIA,This urgent lover stormed my solitude
3663,OREITHYIA,And beat against the haven of my mind.
3664,OREITHYIA,
3665,OREITHYIA,"""And over all a clamour and dis-ease"
3666,OREITHYIA,"Filled earth and air, and shuddered in my knees"
3667,OREITHYIA,"So that I could not stand, but by the wall"
3668,OREITHYIA,Leaned pitifully breathing. Still his call
3669,OREITHYIA,Volleyed against the house and tore the trees.
3670,OREITHYIA,
3671,OREITHYIA,"""Then out my turret-window as I might"
3672,OREITHYIA,I leaned my body to the blind wet night;
3673,OREITHYIA,"That eager lover leapt me, circled round,"
3674,OREITHYIA,"Wreathed, folded, held me prisoner, wrapt and bound"
3675,OREITHYIA,In manacles of terror and delight.
3676,OREITHYIA,
3677,OREITHYIA,"""That night he sealed me to him, and I went"
3678,OREITHYIA,"Thenceforth his leman, submiss and content;"
3679,OREITHYIA,"So from the hall and feast, whenas I heard"
3680,OREITHYIA,"His clear voice call, I flitted like a bird"
3681,OREITHYIA,"That beats the brake, and garnered what he lent."
3682,OREITHYIA,
3683,OREITHYIA,"""I was no maid that was no wife; my days"
3684,OREITHYIA,Went by in dreams whose lights are golden haze
3685,OREITHYIA,"And skies are crimson. Laughing not, nor crying,"
3686,OREITHYIA,"I strayed all witless with my loose hair flying,"
3687,OREITHYIA,Bearing that load that women think their praise.
3688,OREITHYIA,
3689,OREITHYIA,"""And felt my breasts grow heavy with that food"
3690,OREITHYIA,That women laugh to feel and think it good;
3691,OREITHYIA,"But I went shamefast, hanging down my head,"
3692,OREITHYIA,"With girdle all too strait to serve my stead,"
3693,OREITHYIA,And bore an unguessed burden in my blood.
3694,OREITHYIA,
3695,OREITHYIA,"""There was a winter night he came again"
3696,OREITHYIA,"And shook the window, till cried out my pain"
3697,OREITHYIA,"Unto him, saying, 'Lord, I dare not live!"
3698,OREITHYIA,"Lord, I must die of that which thou didst give!"
3699,OREITHYIA,"Pity me, Lord!' and fell. The winter rain"
3700,OREITHYIA,
3701,OREITHYIA,"""Beat at the casement, burst it, and the wind"
3702,OREITHYIA,"Filled all the room, and swept me white and blind"
3703,OREITHYIA,Into the night. I heard the sound of seas
3704,OREITHYIA,"Beleaguer earth, I heard the roaring trees"
3705,OREITHYIA,Singing together. We left them far behind.
3706,OREITHYIA,
3707,OREITHYIA,"""And so he bore me into stormy Thrace,"
3708,OREITHYIA,"Me and my load, and kissed back to my face"
3709,OREITHYIA,"The sweet new blood of youth, and to my limbs"
3710,OREITHYIA,"The wine of life; and there I bore him twins,"
3711,OREITHYIA,"Zethes and Calaïs, in a rock-bound place."""
3712,OREITHYIA,
3713,OREITHYIA,"Oreithyia, by the North Wind carried"
3714,OREITHYIA,"To stormy Thrace, think you of how you tarried"
3715,OREITHYIA,"And let him woo and wed? ""Ah, no, for now"
3716,OREITHYIA,He's kissed all Athens from my open brow.

3728,CLYTIÉ,"Fortuned in Hellas. A maid,"
3729,CLYTIÉ,"Lissom and white as the roe,"
3730,CLYTIÉ,Lived recess'd in a glade.
3731,CLYTIÉ,"Clytié, Hamadryad,"
3732,CLYTIÉ,She was called that I sing--
3733,CLYTIÉ,"Flower so fair, so frail, that to bring her a woe,"
3734,CLYTIÉ,Surely a pitiful thing!
3735,CLYTIÉ,
3736,CLYTIÉ,"A wild bright creature of trees,"
3737,CLYTIÉ,"Brooks, and the sun among leaves,"
3738,CLYTIÉ,"Clytié, grown to be maid:"
3739,CLYTIÉ,"Ah, she had eyes like the sea's"
3740,CLYTIÉ,Iris of green and blue!
3741,CLYTIÉ,"White as sea-foam her brows,"
3742,CLYTIÉ,And her hair reedy and gold:
3743,CLYTIÉ,So she grew and waxt supple and fit to be spouse
3744,CLYTIÉ,In a king's palace of old.
3745,CLYTIÉ,
3746,CLYTIÉ,"All in a kirtle of green,"
3747,CLYTIÉ,"With her tangle of red-gold hair,"
3748,CLYTIÉ,"In the live heart of an oak,"
3749,CLYTIÉ,"Clytié, harbouring there,"
3750,CLYTIÉ,"Thronéd there as a queen,"
3751,CLYTIÉ,Clytié wondering woke:
3752,CLYTIÉ,"Ah, child, what set thee too high for thy sweet demesne,"
3753,CLYTIÉ,And who ponder'd the doleful stroke?
3754,CLYTIÉ,
3755,CLYTIÉ,"For the child that was maiden grown,"
3756,CLYTIÉ,"The queen of the forest places,"
3757,CLYTIÉ,"Clytié, Hamadryad,"
3758,CLYTIÉ,"Tired of the joy she had,"
3759,CLYTIÉ,And the kingdom that was her own;
3760,CLYTIÉ,"And tired of the quick wood-races,"
3761,CLYTIÉ,"And joy of herself in the pool when she wonder'd down,"
3762,CLYTIÉ,And tired of her budded graces.
3763,CLYTIÉ,
3764,CLYTIÉ,And the child lookt up to the Sun
3765,CLYTIÉ,And the burning track of his car
3766,CLYTIÉ,In the broad serene above her:
3767,CLYTIÉ,"""O King Sun, be thou my lover,"

3773,CLYTIÉ,
3774,CLYTIÉ,"Rose-flusht, daring, she strain'd"
3775,CLYTIÉ,"Her young arms up, and she voiced"
3776,CLYTIÉ,The wild desire of her heart.
3777,CLYTIÉ,"The woodland heard her, the faun,"
3778,CLYTIÉ,"The satyr, and things that start,"
3779,CLYTIÉ,"Peering, heard her; the dove, crooning, complain'd"
3780,CLYTIÉ,In the pine-tree by the lawn.
3781,CLYTIÉ,Only the runnel rejoiced
3782,CLYTIÉ,In his rushy hollow apart
3783,CLYTIÉ,To see her beauty flash up
3784,CLYTIÉ,White and red as the dawn.
3785,CLYTIÉ,
3786,CLYTIÉ,"Sorrow, ye passers-by,"
3787,CLYTIÉ,"The quick lift of her word,"
3788,CLYTIÉ,The crimson blush of her pride!
3789,CLYTIÉ,Heard her the heavens' lord
3790,CLYTIÉ,In his flaming seat in the sky:

3795,CLYTIÉ,
3796,CLYTIÉ,"And he bent unto her, and his mouth"
3797,CLYTIÉ,Burnt her like coals of fire;
3798,CLYTIÉ,"He gazed with passionate eyes,"
3799,CLYTIÉ,"Like flame that kindles and dries,"

4757,GNATHO,"Trotting home like a tired dog,"
4758,GNATHO,By mountain slopes 'twixt the junipers
4759,GNATHO,"And flamed oleanders near the sea,"
4760,GNATHO,"Found a girl-child asleep in a fleece,"
4761,GNATHO,"Frail as wax, golden and rose;"
4762,GNATHO,Whereat at first he skipt aside
4763,GNATHO,"And stayed him, nosing and peering, whereto"
4764,GNATHO,"Next he crept, softly breathing,"
4765,GNATHO,Blinking his fear. None was there
4766,GNATHO,"To guard; the sun had dipt in the sea,"
4767,GNATHO,Faint fire empurpled the flow
4768,GNATHO,"Of heaving water; no speck, no hint"
4769,GNATHO,"Of oar or wing on the main, on the deep"
4770,GNATHO,"Sky, empty as a great shell,"
4771,GNATHO,"Fainting in its own glory. This thing,"
4772,GNATHO,"This rare breath, this miracle--"
4773,GNATHO,Alone with him in the world! His
4774,GNATHO,"To wonder, fall to, with craning eyes"
4775,GNATHO,"Fearfully daring; next, since it moved not,"
4776,GNATHO,"Stooping, to handle, to stroke, to peer upon"
4777,GNATHO,"Closely, nosing its tender length,"
4778,GNATHO,Doglike snuffing--at last to kiss
4779,GNATHO,"In reverence wonderful, lightlier far"
4780,GNATHO,"Than thistledown falls, brushing the Earth."
4781,GNATHO,"But the child awoke and, watching him, cried not,"

4783,GNATHO,"Blinking eyes, red-litten, astare,"
4784,GNATHO,"Horns and feet--nay, crowed and strained"

4787,GNATHO,"Light as foam, hued like the foam,"
4788,GNATHO,"A breath-bubble of fire, will carry,"
4789,GNATHO,"He in arms lifted his freight,"
4790,GNATHO,Looking wonderfully upon it
4791,GNATHO,"With scarce a breath, and humbleness"
4792,GNATHO,To be so brute ebbed to the flood
4793,GNATHO,Of pride in his new assuréd worth--
4794,GNATHO,"Trusted so, who could be vile?"
4795,GNATHO,
4796,GNATHO,"So to his cave in the wood he bore her,"
4797,GNATHO,Fleeting swift as a fear thro' the dark trees.
4798,GNATHO,
4799,GNATHO,"There in the silence of tall trees,"
4800,GNATHO,"Under the soaring shafts,"
4801,GNATHO,"Far beneath the canopied leafage,"
4802,GNATHO,"In the forest whisper, the thick silences;"
4803,GNATHO,Or on the wastes
4804,GNATHO,Of sheltered mountains where the spires
4805,GNATHO,Of solemn cypress frame the descent
4806,GNATHO,"Upon the blue, and open to sea--"
4807,GNATHO,Here grew Ianthe maiden slim
4808,GNATHO,With none to spy but this gnarled man-brute;
4809,GNATHO,"Most fair, most hid, like a wood-flower"
4810,GNATHO,Slim for lack of light; so she grew
4811,GNATHO,In flowering line of limb
4812,GNATHO,"And flower of face, retired and shy,"
4813,GNATHO,"Urged by the bland air; unknown,"
4814,GNATHO,"Lonely and lovely, husbanding"
4815,GNATHO,"Her great possessions--hers now,"
4816,GNATHO,Another's when he cared to claim them.
4817,GNATHO,For thus went life: to lead the herds
4818,GNATHO,Of pricking deer she saw the great stags
4819,GNATHO,"Battle in empty glades, then mate;"
4820,GNATHO,"Thus on the mountains chose the bears,"
4821,GNATHO,And in the woods she heard the wolves
4822,GNATHO,Anguishing in their loves
4823,GNATHO,"Thro' the dense nights, far in the forest."
4824,GNATHO,"And so collected went she, and sure"
4825,GNATHO,Her time would come and with it her master.
4826,GNATHO,
4827,GNATHO,But Gnatho watcht her under his brows
4828,GNATHO,"When she lay heedless, spilling beauty--"
4829,GNATHO,"How ever lovelier, suppler, sleeker,"
4830,GNATHO,"How more desirable, how near;"
4831,GNATHO,"How rightly his, how surely his--"
4832,GNATHO,Then gnaw'd his cheek and turn'd his head.
4833,GNATHO,
4834,GNATHO,"For unsuspect, some dim forbidding"
4835,GNATHO,Rose within him and knockt at his heart
4836,GNATHO,"And said, Not thine, but for reverence."
4837,GNATHO,"And some wild horror desperate drove him,"
4838,GNATHO,Suing a pardon from unknown Gods
4839,GNATHO,"For untold trespass, to seek the sea,"
4840,GNATHO,"Upon whose shore, to whose cool breathing"
4841,GNATHO,"He'd stretch his arms, broken with strife"
4842,GNATHO,Of self and self; and all that water
4843,GNATHO,Steadfast lapt and surged. Came tears
4844,GNATHO,"To furrow his cheeks, came strength to return"
4845,GNATHO,"To her, and bear with longer breath"
4846,GNATHO,"Her sweet familiarities, blind"
4847,GNATHO,Obedience to nascent blind desire--
4848,GNATHO,Till again he lookt and burn'd again.
4849,GNATHO,
4850,GNATHO,Thus his black ferment boil'd. O' nights
4851,GNATHO,He'd dream and revel frenziedly
4852,GNATHO,"As with the love-stung nymphs. Awake,"
4853,GNATHO,"In a chill sweat, he'd tear at himself,"
4854,GNATHO,"Claw at his flesh and leap in the brook,"
4855,GNATHO,Drench the red embers of his vice
4856,GNATHO,"Into a mass abhorred. Clean then,"
4857,GNATHO,He'd seek his bed and pass unscath'd
4858,GNATHO,The bower of fern where the sleek limbs
4859,GNATHO,"Of white Ianthe, mesht in her hair,"
4860,GNATHO,Lay lax in sleep. But Gnatho now
4861,GNATHO,"Saw only God, as on some still peak"
4862,GNATHO,Snowy and lonely under the stars
4863,GNATHO,"We look, and see God in all that calm."
4864,GNATHO,
4865,GNATHO,"One night of glamour, under a moon"
4866,GNATHO,"That seemed to steep the air with gold,"
4867,GNATHO,They two sat stilly and watcht the sea
4868,GNATHO,Tremulously heaving over a path
4869,GNATHO,Of light like a river of molten gold.
4870,GNATHO,Warm blew the breeze to land; she lean'd
4871,GNATHO,"Her idle head, idly played"
4872,GNATHO,"Her fingers in his belt, and he"
4873,GNATHO,"Embracing held her, yielding, subdued;"
4874,GNATHO,"Sideways saw the curve of her cheek,"
4875,GNATHO,"Downcast lashes, droopt lip"
4876,GNATHO,Which seem'd to court his pleasure--
4877,GNATHO,Then
4878,GNATHO,On waves of fire came racing his needs
4879,GNATHO,With zest of rage to possess and tear
4880,GNATHO,"That which his frenzy, maskt as love,"
4881,GNATHO,"Courted: so he lean'd to her ear,"
4882,GNATHO,Thrilled in torrents hoarse his case--
4883,GNATHO,"""Love, I burn, I burn!"
4884,GNATHO,"Slake me, love!"" He raved in whisper."
4885,GNATHO,"And she lookt up with her wide full eyes,"
4886,GNATHO,"Saying, ""My love!"" and yielded herself."
4887,GNATHO,
4888,GNATHO,"Deep night settled on hill and plain,"
4889,GNATHO,"The moon went out, the concourse of stars"
4890,GNATHO,"Lay strewn above, and with golden eyes"
4891,GNATHO,Peered on them lockt. Far and faint
4892,GNATHO,The great stags belled; far and faint
4893,GNATHO,Quested the wolves; the leopards' howling
4894,GNATHO,Lent desolation to night; and low
4895,GNATHO,The night-jar purr'd. At sea one light
4896,GNATHO,"Swayed restlessly, and on the rocks"
4897,GNATHO,Sounded the tireless lapping deep.
4898,GNATHO,Lockt they lay thro' all the silences.
4899,GNATHO,
4900,GNATHO,Dawn stole in with whimper of rain
4901,GNATHO,And a wailing wind from the sea--
4902,GNATHO,"Gray sea, gray dawn and scurrying clouds"
4903,GNATHO,"And scud of rain. The fisher boat,"
4904,GNATHO,"The sands, the headlands fringed with broom"
4905,GNATHO,And tamarisk were blotted.
4906,GNATHO,"Alone,"
4907,GNATHO,Caged in the mist of earth
4908,GNATHO,"That beat his torment back to himself,"
4909,GNATHO,"So that in vain he sought for the Gods,"
4910,GNATHO,And lifted up hands in vain
4911,GNATHO,To witness this white wreck prone and still--
4912,GNATHO,Gnatho the Satyr blinkt on his work.
