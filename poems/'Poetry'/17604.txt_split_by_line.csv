27,NEW YORK.,[Illustration: _A Slave sold at Auction._]
28,NEW YORK.,
29,NEW YORK.,"A time there was, when no one thought"
30,NEW YORK.,"It sin, to hold a slave he'd bought,"
31,NEW YORK.,"And of his strength have the command,"
32,NEW YORK.,As much as of his house and land.
33,NEW YORK.,A Yankee Lawyer long had kept
34,NEW YORK.,A negro-man with whom he slept.
35,NEW YORK.,
36,NEW YORK.,[Illustration]
37,NEW YORK.,
38,NEW YORK.,"And ate, and Sabbath day,"
39,NEW YORK.,He half the time from church would stay;
40,NEW YORK.,When Cuff his master's garments wore.--
41,NEW YORK.,"'Twas strange you say, but he was poor;"
42,NEW YORK.,"And though he cared not for Cuff's soul,"
43,NEW YORK.,"Yet such the times, that on the whole,"
44,NEW YORK.,
45,NEW YORK.,[Illustration: CAGE.]
46,NEW YORK.,
47,NEW YORK.,"""_Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still, slavery, thou art a bitter"
48,NEW YORK.,"draught._""--STERNE."
49,NEW YORK.,
50,NEW YORK.,"His slave must to the meeting go,"
51,NEW YORK.,If 'twas for nothing but a show.
52,NEW YORK.,They lived on thus for several years--
53,NEW YORK.,"One would not think, that many tears"
54,NEW YORK.,"Would fall from off that shining face,"
55,NEW YORK.,"So sleek and smooth, or he would trace"
56,NEW YORK.,
57,NEW YORK.,"[Illustration: NOTE.--_In some parts of the country, slaves are"
58,NEW YORK.,"scantily fed, while their masters live in luxury_.]"
59,NEW YORK.,
60,NEW YORK.,"The chain which bound, or wish to break,"
61,NEW YORK.,"But choose to stay for his own sake,"
62,NEW YORK.,"Where he so well was clothed and fed,"
63,NEW YORK.,"And shared the lawyer's food and bed,"
64,NEW YORK.,"So well contented he might be,"
65,NEW YORK.,"He'd hardly know but he was free,"
66,NEW YORK.,
67,NEW YORK.,"[Illustration: _Fetters formerly used by the slave traders, to confine"
68,NEW YORK.,the ankles of their victims. The editor has seen some that were actually
69,NEW YORK.,used by Rhode Island traders._]
70,NEW YORK.,
71,NEW YORK.,But make the fetters of pure gold.
72,NEW YORK.,"They're hateful still, they gall, they hold,"
73,NEW YORK.,"And if the pill is sugared o'er,"
74,NEW YORK.,'Tis still as bitter as before.
75,NEW YORK.,"Cuff ponder'd much, but did not know,"
76,NEW YORK.,"If he his master left to go,"
77,NEW YORK.,
78,NEW YORK.,[Illustration: _A Cruel Master._]
79,NEW YORK.,
80,NEW YORK.,"And seek his fortune, he could find"
81,NEW YORK.,"Another master half so kind,"
82,NEW YORK.,And who would give so large a share
83,NEW YORK.,"Of the small pittance he could spare,"
84,NEW YORK.,"And every privilege could grant,"
85,NEW YORK.,Which he could need or ever want;
86,NEW YORK.,
87,NEW YORK.,[Illustration: _Emblem of Freedom.--A moth just changed from its
88,NEW YORK.,"chrysalis state, deserting its shell._]"
89,NEW YORK.,
90,NEW YORK.,"But then of freedom he had heard,"
91,NEW YORK.,And ere the dawning light appeared.
92,NEW YORK.,"Early one morning Cuff arose,"
93,NEW YORK.,"And quickly putting on his clothes,"
94,NEW YORK.,Stole softly out; lest he should wake
95,NEW YORK.,"His master, who would rouse and shake"
96,NEW YORK.,
97,NEW YORK.,[Illustration: NOTE.--_The Lawyer owned a Blacksmith's shop._]
98,NEW YORK.,
99,NEW YORK.,"The slumbers from his drowsy eyes,"
100,NEW YORK.,And think that it was time to rise.
101,NEW YORK.,"So Cuff went off. His master woke,"
102,NEW YORK.,And Cuff was gone! It was no joke.
103,NEW YORK.,"The Lawyer's work must now be done,"
104,NEW YORK.,All by himself; and till the sun
105,NEW YORK.,
106,NEW YORK.,[Illustration: _A man escaping from slavery._]
107,NEW YORK.,
108,NEW YORK.,"Is slowly sinking in the west,"
109,NEW YORK.,He'll scarcely have a minute's rest.
110,NEW YORK.,"He felt his temper quickly rise,"
111,NEW YORK.,"Thinking his slave too rich a prize,"
112,NEW YORK.,"To be allowed to slip away,"
113,NEW YORK.,"Without a trial for ""fair play;"""
114,NEW YORK.,
115,NEW YORK.,[Illustration: _A slave-catcher is worse than a beast of prey._]
116,NEW YORK.,
117,NEW YORK.,"Said he, ""My course is plain enough,"
118,NEW YORK.,"I'll take my horse and go for Cuff,"
119,NEW YORK.,"For he's my slave, and he shall give"
120,NEW YORK.,"To me, his service if he live."""
121,NEW YORK.,"Saddling his horse he mounts him quick,"
122,NEW YORK.,Drives after Cuff with spur and stick:
123,NEW YORK.,
124,NEW YORK.,"[Illustration: ""_Angel of Mercy._""]"
125,NEW YORK.,
126,NEW YORK.,"But soon he paused his cause to try,"
127,NEW YORK.,"And thus he said, Why should not I"
128,NEW YORK.,"Be slave instead of Cuff, and he"
129,NEW YORK.,As well be running after me
130,NEW YORK.,"As I for him?--I'll let him go,"
131,NEW YORK.,Whether he's free by law or no.
132,NEW YORK.,
133,NEW YORK.,[Illustration: _Justice freeing the slave._]
134,NEW YORK.,
135,NEW YORK.,"_For God who fashioned him and me,_"
136,NEW YORK.,_No doubt_ MADE ALL HIS CHILDREN FREE.
137,NEW YORK.,"So justice o'er his mind held sway,"
138,NEW YORK.,"And Cuff in freedom, went his way."
