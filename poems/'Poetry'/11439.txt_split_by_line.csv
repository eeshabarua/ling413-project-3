32,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
33,PREFACE.,
34,PREFACE.,
35,PREFACE.,"The Authoress of ""THE SNOW-DROP"" has been misfortune's child. Disease"
36,PREFACE.,laid its relentless hand upon her in early childhood. It deprived her of
37,PREFACE.,a common school education and the world's sweet intercourse. Such has
38,PREFACE.,"been its nature, that, except on one occasion, she has not been able to"
39,PREFACE.,leave home for more than six years.
40,PREFACE.,
41,PREFACE.,"""THE SNOW-DROP"" would never have appeared had not life's wintry hour"
42,PREFACE.,"given it birth! It was written to beguile tedious time. Winds, as they"
43,PREFACE.,played through groves that surround her aged father's retired and humble
44,PREFACE.,"dwelling, sweet songsters, as they caroled from spray to spray, and the"
45,PREFACE.,"ripple of the Androscoggin, as it glided past, to her ear, were nature's"
46,PREFACE.,"sweet minstrels, that cheered her heart in solitude and inspired _her,"
47,PREFACE.,"too,_ to attempt the artless strains of nature."
48,PREFACE.,
49,PREFACE.,"This little work, at the suggestion of her friends, is presented and"
50,PREFACE.,"dedicated to the benevolent public, humbly hoping and trusting that it"
51,PREFACE.,"may give pastime to the leisure hour, impress more fully moral and"
52,PREFACE.,"religious sentiment, and afford some little return for the thought she"
53,PREFACE.,has bestowed upon it.

58,THE SNOW-DROP[1],THE SNOW-DROP[1]
59,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
60,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
61,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"Sweet little unassuming flower,"
62,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"It stays not for an April shower,"
63,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"But dares to rear its tiny head,"
64,THE SNOW-DROP[1],While threat'ning clouds the skies o'erspread.
65,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
66,THE SNOW-DROP[1],It ne'er displays the vain desire
67,THE SNOW-DROP[1],To dress in flaunting gay attire;
68,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"No purple, scarlet, blue, or gold,"
69,THE SNOW-DROP[1],Deck its fair leaves when they unfold.
70,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
71,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"Born on a cold and wintry night,"
72,THE SNOW-DROP[1],Its flowing robes were snowy white;
73,THE SNOW-DROP[1],No vernal zephyrs fan its form--
74,THE SNOW-DROP[1],It often battles with the storm.
75,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
76,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"It never drank mild summer's dew,"
77,THE SNOW-DROP[1],But chilling winds around it blew;
78,THE SNOW-DROP[1],And hoary frost his mantle spread
79,THE SNOW-DROP[1],Upon the little snow-drop's bed.
80,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
81,THE SNOW-DROP[1],I love this modest little flower;--
82,THE SNOW-DROP[1],It comes in desolation's hour
83,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"The barren landscape's face to cheer,"
84,THE SNOW-DROP[1],When none beside it dares appear.
85,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
86,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"Just like the friend, whose brightest smile"
87,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"Is spared, our sorrows to beguile;"
88,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"Who like some angel from the sky,"
89,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"When needed most, is ever nigh--"
90,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
91,THE SNOW-DROP[1],To pluck vile slander's envious dart
92,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"From out the wounded, bleeding heart,"
93,THE SNOW-DROP[1],And raise from earth the drooping head
94,THE SNOW-DROP[1],When all our summer friends are fled.
95,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
96,THE SNOW-DROP[1],And shall these humble pages dare
97,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"Presume to ask, if they compare"
98,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"With that fair, fragrant, precious gem,"
99,THE SNOW-DROP[1],Plucked from cold winter's diadem?
100,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
101,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"'Tis true both struggled into life,"
102,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"Through scenes of sorrow, care and strife;"
103,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"This poor, frail, intellectual flower"
104,THE SNOW-DROP[1],Was reared in no elysian bower.
105,THE SNOW-DROP[1],
106,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"No ray of fortune on it shone,--"
107,THE SNOW-DROP[1],It forced its weary way alone;
108,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"Up-springing from the barren sod,"
109,THE SNOW-DROP[1],"Untilled, save by affliction's rod."
110,THE SNOW-DROP[1],

121,MY BIRTH PLACE,"Where ""old Blue"" mountain's healthful breeze"
122,MY BIRTH PLACE,"Swept o'er the green hill-side,"
123,MY BIRTH PLACE,My little fragile bark was launched
124,MY BIRTH PLACE,On life's uncertain tide.
125,MY BIRTH PLACE,
126,MY BIRTH PLACE,There verdant fields and murm'ring brooks
127,MY BIRTH PLACE,Invited me to roam;
128,MY BIRTH PLACE,Old towering trees their heads upreared
129,MY BIRTH PLACE,Around my quiet home.
130,MY BIRTH PLACE,
131,MY BIRTH PLACE,"When morn unveiled her blushing face,"
132,MY BIRTH PLACE,The sun came peeping in;
133,MY BIRTH PLACE,"His quiv'ring beams upon the wall,"
134,MY BIRTH PLACE,Checked by the leafy screen.
135,MY BIRTH PLACE,
136,MY BIRTH PLACE,"Oft in some sweet sequestered dell,"
137,MY BIRTH PLACE,The blushing flow'ret smiled;
138,MY BIRTH PLACE,"And threw around a pleasing spell,"
139,MY BIRTH PLACE,"For me, an artless child."
140,MY BIRTH PLACE,
141,MY BIRTH PLACE,"The fragrant blossom peeping up,"
142,MY BIRTH PLACE,"From out the mossy sod,"
143,MY BIRTH PLACE,Caused my young thoughts from earth to rise
144,MY BIRTH PLACE,And soar to nature's God.
145,MY BIRTH PLACE,
146,MY BIRTH PLACE,"In summer, when I wandered forth,"
147,MY BIRTH PLACE,"Beneath the deep green shade,"
148,MY BIRTH PLACE,"Or when mild autumn walked the rounds,"
149,MY BIRTH PLACE,In gorgeous robes arrayed--
150,MY BIRTH PLACE,
151,MY BIRTH PLACE,"Music, in nature's softest strains,"
152,MY BIRTH PLACE,Stole through my little breast;--
153,MY BIRTH PLACE,"'Twas something I could not define,"
154,MY BIRTH PLACE,Nor could it be expressed.
155,MY BIRTH PLACE,
156,MY BIRTH PLACE,"While some admire the pompous pile,"
157,MY BIRTH PLACE,"Or glitt'ring, costly dome,"
158,MY BIRTH PLACE,"I'd gaze upon those ancient trees,"
159,MY BIRTH PLACE,Round that sweet rural home.

191,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"Upon the little murm'ring brook,"
192,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"But tossed his head in proud disdain,"

202,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"In after years to me he came,"

280,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,For those who never bend the knee
281,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"To haughty monarchs, just like thee,"

292,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"The vapors, which from us ascend,"
293,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,To vegetation are a friend;--
294,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"In dew they soon descend again,"
295,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,Or fall in fruitful showers of rain.
296,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"Were there no brooks, there'd be no bread--"

298,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"No man, nor beast, or plant, or flower,"
299,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,Without us could survive an hour;--
300,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,The feathered songsters of the grove.
301,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,Would cease to chant their notes of love.
302,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,Earth would become a scene of gloom--
303,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,One vast extended direful tomb.--
304,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"And I must tell thee, ere I go,"

306,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"Thou 'dst fade and wither, droop and die,"
307,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,And in the dust neglected lie.
308,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,Yet still no praise belongs to me--
309,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,I do not sympathize with thee;
310,COMPOSED FOR THE FRANKLIN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.,"I never can be proud and vain,"

2932,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,amusing himself with soap bubbles and firebrand ribbons.
2933,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,
2934,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"""But,"" says one, ""they were created for a scourge and a snare to fallen"
2935,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,man; for while we are compelled to spend much of our time in destroying
2936,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"thorns and thistles from our premises, they are continually tempting the"
2937,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"weaker part of our race to spend their strength and time upon that,"
2938,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"which at best, can yield no profit."" But against this assertion, the"
2939,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"scriptures afford us ample proof, for we are there informed, that they"
2940,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"were created before the fall, and pronounced very good, while thorns and"
2941,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"thistles were brought forth afterwards; for the Lord said, when"
2942,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"pronouncing the curse upon Adam, ""Cursed be the ground for thy sake,"
2943,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"thorns and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee,"" thus implying that"
2944,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"they were not already in existence. And again, flowers are universally"
2945,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"spoken of in scripture as blessings, or used as emblems of things"
2946,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"valuable or pleasing, while thorns and thistles are always used to"
2947,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"represent things hurtful, or afflictive. And if any part of nature's"

2949,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"of death, is it not flowers? It is true, they neither supply us with"

2952,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"were they made for the fowls of the air, or the beasts of the field, for"
2953,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"they totally disregard them; we never see the ox, the horse, or the"
2954,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"sheep, stop to smell their fragrance or gaze upon their beauty. And many"
2955,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"of those who are termed the lords of creation, consider them beneath the"
2956,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"notice of intellectual beings, and yet they were made for some wise"
2957,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,purpose. We will therefore admit the truth of an assertion made by a
2958,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"friend, who remarked that flowers were doubtless created for the sole"
2959,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,purpose of gratifying the weak and childish minds of the female sex. Be

2962,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"productions; for which she has reserved her most grateful perfumes, her"
2963,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"richest dyes, and the finest strokes of her pencil. Yes, we _will_"

2965,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"manner in which we spend our time than the Lord of the universe was,"
2966,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,for he planted flowers in _his_ garden. The scriptures inform us that he
2967,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,planted every tree that was pleasant to the sight. And flowers certainly
2968,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"were pleasant, even to the pure eyes of our Savior; for while speaking"
2969,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"of the lilies of the field, he says, ""Even Solomon, in all his glory,"
2970,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"was not arrayed like one of these."" And the wisest of men, when"
2971,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"searching the world over for comparisons worthy of his beloved, exclaims"
2972,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"in the fullness of a heart overflowing with love and gratitude, ""He is"

2994,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"odors, and gaze upon such beautiful colors and delicate tints, combined"
2995,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,with gracefulness and elegance of form. The art of man has long been
2996,THE CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS.,"striving to imitate them, but the simplest flower that blooms still"

3023,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"Though we never hear her melting lays, yet persons in every station,"

3027,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,
3028,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,We are continually surrounded by scenes calculated to produce this
3029,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,music. The variegated scenery of different landscapes; the changing
3030,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"seasons of the year; Spring with her balmy air, soft refreshing showers,"
3031,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"green fields, fragrant flowers, and merry cheerful birds; Summer, with"
3032,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"her sultry days, her cool inviting shades, her waving fields, and"
3033,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"delicious fruits; and Autumn, with his rich golden harvest, bright"

3041,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"beauty; where art has never plucked her native bloom, and tinged her"
3042,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"cheek with carmine. We there gaze upon the tall old trees, which have"
3043,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"for centuries been towering higher and higher, till they seem ambitious"
3044,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,to wave their lofty tops among the very clouds of heaven. We quench our
3045,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"thirst with the sparkling waters of the pure spring, which bubbles up"
3046,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"cool and clear from its crystal fountain, washing the roots of the"
3047,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"trees, and trickling over the ground in bright streams, like threads of"
3048,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"molten silver, till they unite in one of those beautiful streamlets"
3049,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"which lend such enchantment to the woodland bowers; here, murmuring"
3050,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"melodiously among smooth rocks and bright pebbles, while the dimpling"
3051,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,eddies upon its surface reflect the rays of laughing sunshine which
3052,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"quiver through the leafy canopy above; there, dashing over a projecting"
3053,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"rock forming a little cascade, and then flowing smoothly along, bearing"
3054,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,upon its tranquil bosom the fair images of the flowers which spring up
3055,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"along its banks, upon the sloping hill-side and in every shady nook and"
3056,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"dell, smiling in strange beauty among the stern features of the woodland"
3057,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"scene. Sweet flowers, so fair and fragile, that they flourish only when"
3058,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"sheltered from the rude blast and pelting storm by some friendly shade,"
3059,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"and so modest and retiring in their habits, that they shun the open"
3060,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"field, where they must encounter the scrutinizing gaze of the noonday"

3062,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,
3063,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"We stand upon the shores of the ocean, while the sun emerges from its"
3064,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"bed, lifting his broad shining disk above the blue waters, and tinging"
3065,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,the sparkling waves with every hue that decks the rainbow's form. We
3066,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"gaze with rapture upon the scene, till, dazzled by its brilliancy, we"
3067,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"turn our eyes upon the white sails, gliding over the bosom of the deep,"
3068,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"like some noble bird winging its way through the air, or watch the"
3069,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"swelling waves, as they roll in grand procession towards us, and break"
3070,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,in thunder on the shore. We sit in a calm summer evening and watch the
3071,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"shadows as they lengthen o'er the ground, till they lose themselves in"
3072,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"the deep rich green of the vales from winch the sun has disappeared, to"
3073,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,gild the tops of the forest trees and far off hills with more than
3074,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"noonday splendor. The balmy zephyrs hold their breath, nor dare to"
3075,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"whisper in the softest tone, while the little forest birds, in sweetly"
3076,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"pensive strains, are chanting forth their evening hymn of praise and"
3077,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"homage to the sun, who, now all bright with parting smiles, sinks down"
3078,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"behind the western hills, tinging the clouds at first with light faint"
3079,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"orange streaks, which soon turn to crimson, and touched again by"
3080,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"sunset's magic wand, they glow in purple of the richest dyes, then"
3081,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"slowly fade to grey, while twilight draws around us her dewy curtains"
3082,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,and shuts the scene from our admiring gaze.
3083,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,
3084,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"We walk abroad in the calm stillness of a moonlight evening, when night,"
3085,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"cheered by the presence of her fair queen, withholds her dusky pall and"
3086,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,contents herself by drawing a thin silvery veil over the fair-face of
3087,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"nature, which only serves to cast a shade of pensive beauty upon her"
3088,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"lovely features. The rocks, the fields, the lakes and streams, the"
3089,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"distant hills and mountains, whose lofty peaks are crowned with the"
3090,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"white fleecy clouds which skirt the horizon, appear far more lovely when"
3091,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"viewed by the pure dreamy light now stealing around us, than when"
3092,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,displayed to our sight by the clear light of day. The trees and shrubs
3093,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"lie pictured on the dewy earth, their fair images reposing in motionless"
3094,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"beauty, save when the cool breath of evening plays among the verdant"
3095,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"branches, disturbing their shadowy outlines. No sound breaks upon the"
3096,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"stillness of the scene, except the gentle murmur of the winding stream"
3097,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"or the roar of some far off waterfall, softened and subdued by distance,"
3098,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,till it mingles in harmony with the clear shrill notes of the
3099,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"whippowils, who never close their waking eyes, but serenade the moon"
3100,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"till morning light, while every object upon which we turn our eyes"
3101,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,reminds us of the fancy sketch of some fairy land.
3102,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,
3103,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"We gaze upon the grand array, when Aurora Borealis plays her antic"
3104,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"freaks, fights her mimic battles, waves her flaming banner along the"
3105,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"northern skies. We look out upon the blue expanse above, when the bright"
3106,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"and beautiful stars, with their sparkling eyes, are looking from their"
3107,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,distant homes upon our little earth like angels commissioned to watch
3108,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"over its slumbering inhabitants, till the clear light of day arouses"
3109,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,them to life and consciousness. In view of objects and scenes like
3110,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"these, a pleasing sensation steals over the mind, till no language can"
3111,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,express the emotions which struggle for vent within our bosoms and the
3112,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,full heart flutters like an imprisoned bird against the walls of its
3113,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,cage.
3114,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,
3115,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,This is what we call music of the mind. Yet when no love to the Creator
3116,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"mingles with our contemplations, it is music of an inferior order. But"
3117,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"when an individual is brought to realize and ""believe with all his"

3121,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"throne of glory, while he descended to our earth, and gave his life to"
3122,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"ransom guilty rebels against his righteous government, pouring out his"
3123,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,blood on Calvary till the fountain is sufficient to cleanse the foulest
3124,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"stains of sin, even from the most polluted soul; then it is that his"
3125,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"mind is filled with music, and that too, which is as much superior to"
3126,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"any ever experienced by an unregenerate soul, as the full blaze of the"
3127,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,noonday sun is to the faint light which glimmers from the burning taper.
3128,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"For every fibre of the heart, now touched by the finger of God, wakes in"
3129,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"harmony, and vibrates with the richest music of which earth or heaven"
3130,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,can boast. It is the very same which animates the spirits of just men
3131,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"made perfect, and none but blood washed sinners can ever learn the song."

3133,MUSIC OF THE MIND.,"No music, borne from Eden's bowers,"
