147,CONTENTS,
148,CONTENTS,_Probably the most important contribution to modern poetical theory is
149,CONTENTS,Mr. Robert Graves' book_ On English Poetry. _He grounds it upon Man as a
150,CONTENTS,"Neurotic Animal. Poetry is to the poet, he argues, what dreams are to"
151,CONTENTS,"the ordinary man: a symbolical way, that is, of resolving those"
152,CONTENTS,complexes which deadlock of emotion has produced. If this book meets
153,CONTENTS,"with the success it deserves, it is probable that there will be a great"
154,CONTENTS,"deal of psycho-analytical criticism afloat, that the symbolic test will"
155,CONTENTS,become the sole criterion of distinguishing the true from the fake poem;
156,CONTENTS,"until some sort of 'Metamorphic' school arise, who defeat this by"
157,CONTENTS,"consciously faking their symbolism. I do not wish to oppose this thesis,"
158,CONTENTS,"but only to suggest that though true, it is only a partial truth: and"
159,CONTENTS,that to make it the sole criterion of poetry would be damning: that as
160,CONTENTS,"well as being a neurotic animal, Man is a Communicative Animal, and a"
161,CONTENTS,Pattern-making Animal: that poetry cannot be traced simply to a sort of
162,CONTENTS,"automatic psycho-therapy, but that these and many other causes are"
163,CONTENTS,"co-responsible. Indeed, though many of these poems may still prove poems"
164,CONTENTS,"within the meaning of Mr. Graves' Act, I should be sorry that they"
165,CONTENTS,should be read with no other purpose than indecently to detect my
166,CONTENTS,neuroses._

183,_R. H._,"Whenever there is no moon, and the rain drips cold,"

187,_R. H._,"Martha and Johnnie, who have no money:"
188,_R. H._,"The small naked puppies who whimper against the bitches,"

190,_R. H._,
191,_R. H._,But when the moon is run like a red fox
192,_R. H._,Cover to cover behind the skies;
193,_R. H._,"And the breezes crack in the trees on the rocks,"
194,_R. H._,Or stoop to flutter about the eyes
195,_R. H._,Of one who dreams in the scent of pines
196,_R. H._,At ease:
197,_R. H._,Then would you not go foot it with Sarah's Girls
198,_R. H._,In and out the trees?

211,_R. H._,"Their clouted shoes are mostly off,"
212,_R. H._,"And some are quarrelling, and one"
213,_R. H._,"Cools half her face, nose downward bubbling,"
214,_R. H._,Wetting her clo'es and never troubling;
215,_R. H._,"Bobble, bobble, bobble there"
216,_R. H._,Till bubbles like young earthquakes heave
217,_R. H._,"The orange island of her hair,"
218,_R. H._,And tidal waves run up her sleeve;
219,_R. H._,Another's tanned as brown as bistre;
220,_R. H._,"Another ducks his little sister,"
221,_R. H._,And all are mixed in such a crowd
222,_R. H._,And tell their separate joys so loud
223,_R. H._,"That who can be this silent one,"
224,_R. H._,"This dimpled, pensive, baby one?"
225,_R. H._,--She sits the sunny steps so still
226,_R. H._,"For hours, trying hard to kill"
227,_R. H._,One fly at least of those that buzz
228,_R. H._,So cannily ...
229,_R. H._,And then she does.

239,_R. H._,With screwed-up eyes under a shock
240,_R. H._,Of dull carrot hair?
241,_R. H._,"--Child in the long, torn frock,"
242,_R. H._,Crouched in the warm dust:

254,_R. H._,"Dream you of swords and crowns,"
255,_R. H._,Child of the ditches?
256,_R. H._,
257,_R. H._,_Still in the warm dust
258,_R. H._,Sits she and stares; as if
259,_R. H._,"Stare she must,"
260,_R. H._,Pale eyes that see through:
261,_R. H._,Soon I must stare too:_
262,_R. H._,
263,_R. H._,Soon through the fierce glare
264,_R. H._,Loom things that are not there:
265,_R. H._,Out of the blind Past
266,_R. H._,Savages grim:
267,_R. H._,"Negroes and muleteers,"
268,_R. H._,Saxons and wanderers
269,_R. H._,"Tall as a ship's mast,"
270,_R. H._,Spectral and dim.

295,_R. H._,"Child without childhood,"
296,_R. H._,"Stained with an earthy stain,"
297,_R. H._,Loveless and fearless:
298,_R. H._,
299,_R. H._,My God is overhead:
300,_R. H._,Yours must be cold. Or dead.
301,_R. H._,
302,_R. H._,--Child with the pinched face
303,_R. H._,Why do you stare
304,_R. H._,With so much knowledge under your shock
305,_R. H._,Of wild matted hair?

314,_R. H._,"When meant, oftenest left unheard:"
315,_R. H._,"When light on the tongue, light in the purse too;"
316,_R. H._,Of curious metallurgy: when coined true
317,_R. H._,"It glitters not, is neither large nor small:"
318,_R. H._,"More worth than rubies--less, times, than a ball."
319,_R. H._,"Not gift, nor willed: yet through its wide range"
320,_R. H._,"Buys what it buys exact, and leaves no change."
321,_R. H._,
322,_R. H._,"Old Gurney had it, won on a hot day"
323,_R. H._,"With ale, from glib-voiced Gipsy by the way."
324,_R. H._,He held it lightly: for 'twas a rum start
325,_R. H._,To find a hedgeling who had still a heart:
326,_R. H._,So put it down for twist of a beggar's tongue ...
327,_R. H._,_He_ had not felt the heat: how the dust stung
328,_R. H._,A face June-roasted: _he_ saw not the look
329,_R. H._,Aslant the gift-mug; how the hand shook ...
330,_R. H._,"Yet the words filled his head, and he grew merry"
331,_R. H._,"And whistled from the Boar to Wrye-brook ferry,"
332,_R. H._,"And chaffed with Ferryman when the hawser creaked,"
333,_R. H._,Or slipping bilge showed where the planks leaked;
334,_R. H._,"--Lent hand himself, till doubly hard the barge"
335,_R. H._,Butted its nose in mud of the farther marge.
336,_R. H._,"When Gurney leapt to shore, he found--dismay!"
337,_R. H._,
338,_R. H._,He had no tuppence--(Tuppence was to pay
339,_R. H._,"To sulky Ferryman).--'Naught have I,' says he,"
340,_R. H._,'Naught but the gratitude of Tammas Lee
341,_R. H._,Given one hour.'--Sulky Charon grinned:
342,_R. H._,"'Done,' said he, 'done: I take it--all of it, mind.'"
343,_R. H._,"'Done,' cries Jan Gurney. Down the road he went,"
344,_R. H._,But by the ford left all his merriment.
345,_R. H._,
346,_R. H._,This is the tale of midday chaffering:
347,_R. H._,"How Charon took, and Gurney lost the thing:"
348,_R. H._,How Ferryman gave it for his youngest daughter
349,_R. H._,To a tall lad who saved her out of the water--
350,_R. H._,"(Being old and mean, had none of his own to give,"
351,_R. H._,"So passed on Tammas', glad to see her live):"
352,_R. H._,How the young farmer paid his quarter's rent
353,_R. H._,"With that one coin, when all else was spent,"
354,_R. H._,And how Squire kept it for some goldless debt ...
355,_R. H._,"For aught I know, it wanders current yet."
356,_R. H._,
357,_R. H._,But Tammas was no angel in disguise:
358,_R. H._,"He stole Squire's chickens--often: he told lies,"
359,_R. H._,"Robbed Charon's garden, burnt young Farmer's ricks"
360,_R. H._,And played the village many lousy tricks.
361,_R. H._,
362,_R. H._,"No children sniffled, and no dog cried,"
363,_R. H._,"When full of oaths and smells, he died."

366,_R. H._,
367,_R. H._,
368,_R. H._,Vagrancy
369,_R. H._,
370,_R. H._,
371,_R. H._,"When the slow year creeps hay-ward, and the skies"
372,_R. H._,"Are warming in the summer's mild surprise,"
373,_R. H._,And the still breeze disturbs each leafy frond
374,_R. H._,"Like hungry fishes dimpling in a pond,"
375,_R. H._,It is a pleasant thing to dream at ease
376,_R. H._,"On sun-warmed thyme, not far from beechen trees."
377,_R. H._,
378,_R. H._,"A robin flashing in a rowan-tree,"
379,_R. H._,"A wanton robin, spills his melody"
380,_R. H._,As if he had such store of golden tones
381,_R. H._,That they were no more worth to him than stones:
382,_R. H._,The sunny lizards dream upon the ledges:
383,_R. H._,"Linnets titter in and out the hedges,"
384,_R. H._,Or swoop among the freckled butterflies.
385,_R. H._,
386,_R. H._,Down to a beechen hollow winds the track
387,_R. H._,And tunnels past my twilit bivouac:
388,_R. H._,Two spiring wisps of smoke go singly up
389,_R. H._,And scarcely tremble in the leafy air.
390,_R. H._,
391,_R. H._,--There are more shadows in this loamy cup
392,_R. H._,"Than God could count: and oh, but it is fair:"
393,_R. H._,"The kindly green and rounded trunks, that meet"
394,_R. H._,Under the soil with twinings of their feet
395,_R. H._,And in the sky with twinings of their arms:
396,_R. H._,The yellow stools: the still ungathered charms
397,_R. H._,"Of berry, woodland herb, and bryony,"
398,_R. H._,"And mid-wood's changeling child, Anemone."
399,_R. H._,
400,_R. H._,*       *       *       *       *
401,_R. H._,
402,_R. H._,Quiet as a grave beneath a spire
403,_R. H._,"I lie and watch the pointed climbing fire,"
404,_R. H._,I lie and watch the smoky weather-cock
405,_R. H._,"That climbs too high, and bends to the breeze's shock,"
406,_R. H._,"And breaks, and dances off across the skies"
407,_R. H._,Gay as a flurry of blue butterflies.
408,_R. H._,
409,_R. H._,"But presently the evening shadows in,"
410,_R. H._,Heralded by the night-jar's solitary din
411,_R. H._,And the quick bat's squeak among the trees;
412,_R. H._,"--Who sudden rises, darting across the air"
413,_R. H._,To weave her filmy web in the Sun's bright hair
414,_R. H._,That slowly sinks dejected on his knees ...
415,_R. H._,
416,_R. H._,Now is he vanished: the bewildered skies
417,_R. H._,Flame out a desperate and last surmise;
418,_R. H._,"Then yield to Night, their sudden conqueror."
419,_R. H._,
420,_R. H._,From pole to pole the shadow of the world
421,_R. H._,"Creeps over heaven, till itself is lit"
422,_R. H._,By the very many stars that wake in it:
423,_R. H._,
424,_R. H._,"Sleep, like a messenger of great import,"
425,_R. H._,Lays quiet and compelling hands athwart
426,_R. H._,The easy idlenesses of my mind.
427,_R. H._,"--There is a breeze above me, and around:"
428,_R. H._,"There is a fire before me, and behind:"
429,_R. H._,"But Sleep doth hold me, and I hear no sound."
430,_R. H._,
431,_R. H._,"In the far West the clouds are mustering,"
432,_R. H._,"Without hurry, noise, or blustering:"
433,_R. H._,And soon as Body's nightly Sentinel
434,_R. H._,"Himself doth nod, I open furtive eyes ..."
435,_R. H._,
436,_R. H._,With darkling hook the Farmer of the Skies
437,_R. H._,"Goes reaping stars: they flicker, one by one,"
438,_R. H._,Nodding a little; tumble--and are gone.
439,_R. H._,
440,_R. H._,
441,_R. H._,
442,_R. H._,
443,_R. H._,Storm: to the Theme of Polyphemus
444,_R. H._,
445,_R. H._,
446,_R. H._,Mortal I stand upon the lifeless hills
447,_R. H._,That jut their cragged bones against the sky:
448,_R. H._,"I crawl upon their naked ebony,"
449,_R. H._,And toil across the scars of Titan ills
450,_R. H._,Dealt by the weaponing of gods and devils:
451,_R. H._,"I climb their uppermost deserted levels,"
452,_R. H._,And see how Heaven glowers his one eye
453,_R. H._,"Blood-red and black-browed in the sullen sky,"
454,_R. H._,While all his face is livid as a corpse
455,_R. H._,And wicked as a snake's: see how he warps
456,_R. H._,"His sultry beam across the misted sea,"
457,_R. H._,As if he grudged its darkling ministry.
458,_R. H._,
459,_R. H._,"He looks so covetous, I think he hides"
460,_R. H._,--Jetsam of the slow ethereal tides--
461,_R. H._,Some cursed and battered Sailor of the Spheres:
462,_R. H._,"All night he ravens on him and his peers,"
463,_R. H._,But with the day he straddles monstrously
464,_R. H._,"Across the earth in churlish shepherdry,"
465,_R. H._,A-hungered for his hideous nightly feast.
466,_R. H._,
467,_R. H._,But storms are gathering in the whitened East:
468,_R. H._,"The day grows darker still, and suddenly"
469,_R. H._,That lone and crafty Prisoner of the Sky
470,_R. H._,Plunges his murky torch in Heaven's Eye:
471,_R. H._,"The blinded, screaming tempest trumpets out"
472,_R. H._,"His windy agonies: Oh, he will spout"
473,_R. H._,His boiling rains upon the soggy air
474,_R. H._,And heave great rocking planets: he will tear
475,_R. H._,And snatch the screeching comets by the hair
476,_R. H._,"To fling them all about him in the sea,"
477,_R. H._,And blast the wretch's fatal Odyssey!
478,_R. H._,
479,_R. H._,The great convulsions of the Deity
480,_R. H._,Rumble in agony across the sky:
481,_R. H._,His thunders rattle in and out the peaks:
482,_R. H._,His lightnings jab at every word He speaks:
483,_R. H._,--At every heavenly curse the cloud is split
484,_R. H._,And daggered lightnings crackle out of it.
485,_R. H._,
486,_R. H._,Like a steep shower of snakes the hissing rain
487,_R. H._,"Flickers its tongues upon the muddied plain,"
488,_R. H._,Writhing and twisting on the gutted rocks
489,_R. H._,That tremble at the heavy thunder-shocks:
490,_R. H._,Soon from the hub on Heaven's axel-tree
491,_R. H._,"The frozen hail flies spinning, and the sea"
492,_R. H._,Is lashed beneath me to a howling smoke
493,_R. H._,As if the frozen fires of hell had woke
494,_R. H._,And cracked their icy flames in the face of Heaven.
495,_R. H._,
496,_R. H._,"Withered and crouching and scarce breathing even,"
497,_R. H._,And battered as a gnat upon a wall
498,_R. H._,"I cling and gasp--climb to my feet, and fall,"
499,_R. H._,"And crawl at last beneath a lidded stone,"
500,_R. H._,Careless if all the earth's foundations groan
501,_R. H._,"And strain in the heaving of this devilry,"
502,_R. H._,Careless at last whether I live or die.

505,_R. H._,
506,_R. H._,So the vast Æschylean tragedy
507,_R. H._,Rolls to its thunderous appointed close:
508,_R. H._,With final mutterings each actor goes:
509,_R. H._,And the huge Heavenly tragedian
510,_R. H._,"Tears from his face the massy mask and wan,"
511,_R. H._,And shines resplendent on the shattered stage
512,_R. H._,"As he has done from age to bewildered age,"
513,_R. H._,Giving the lie to all his mimic rage.

523,_R. H._,"When a brass sun staggers above the sky,"
524,_R. H._,"When feet cleave to boots, and the tongue's dry,"
525,_R. H._,"And sharp dust goads the rolling eye,"
526,_R. H._,"Come thoughts of wine, and dancing thoughts of girls:"
527,_R. H._,"They shiver their white arms, and the head whirls,"
528,_R. H._,And noon light is hid in their dark curls:
529,_R. H._,Noon feet stumble and head swims.
530,_R. H._,"Out shines the sun, and the thought dims,"
531,_R. H._,"And death, for blood, runs in the weak limbs."
532,_R. H._,
533,_R. H._,To fall on flints in the shade of tall nettles
534,_R. H._,"Gives easy sleep as a bed of rose petals,"
535,_R. H._,And dust drifting from the highway
536,_R. H._,As light a coverlet as down may.
537,_R. H._,The myriad feet of many-sized flies
538,_R. H._,May not open those tired eyes.
539,_R. H._,
540,_R. H._,The first wind of night
541,_R. H._,Twitches the coverlet away quite:
542,_R. H._,The first wind and large first rain
543,_R. H._,Flickers the dry pulse to life again.
544,_R. H._,Flickers the lids burning on the eyes:
545,_R. H._,Come sudden flashes of the slipping skies:
546,_R. H._,"Hunger, oldest visionary,"
547,_R. H._,"Hides a devil in a tree,"
548,_R. H._,"Hints a glory in the clouds,"
549,_R. H._,Fills the crooked air with crowds
550,_R. H._,Of ivory sightless demons singing--
551,_R. H._,Eyes start: straightens back:
552,_R. H._,Limbs stagger and crack:
553,_R. H._,"But brain flies, brain soars"
554,_R. H._,"Up, where the Sky roars"
555,_R. H._,Upon the back of cherubim:
556,_R. H._,Brain rockets up to Him.
557,_R. H._,Body gives another twist
558,_R. H._,To the slack waist-band;
559,_R. H._,In agony clenches fist
560,_R. H._,Till the nails bite the hand.
561,_R. H._,"Body floats light as air,"
562,_R. H._,With rain in its sparse hair.
563,_R. H._,
564,_R. H._,"Brain returns, and would tell"
565,_R. H._,The things he has seen well:
566,_R. H._,
567,_R. H._,Body will not stir his lips:
568,_R. H._,Mind and Body come to grips.

570,_R. H._,Deadly each hates the other
571,_R. H._,As treacherous blood brother.

573,_R. H._,"No sight, no sound shows"
574,_R. H._,How the struggle goes.

585,_R. H._,"Jonathan Barlow loved wet skies,"
586,_R. H._,And golden leaves on a rollick wind ...
587,_R. H._,"The clouds drip damp on his crumbled eyes,"
588,_R. H._,And the storm his roystering dirge hath dinned.
589,_R. H._,
590,_R. H._,"Proud buck rabbits he loved, and the feel"
591,_R. H._,Of a finicky nose that sniffed his hand:
592,_R. H._,"So now they burrow, and crop their meal;"
593,_R. H._,Their fore-paws scatter him up in sand.
594,_R. H._,
595,_R. H._,"He loved old bracken, and now it pushes"
596,_R. H._,Affectionate roots between his bones:
597,_R. H._,"He runs in the sap of the young spring bushes,"
598,_R. H._,"--Basks, when a June sun warms the stones."

614,_R. H._,By Rumney Brook
615,_R. H._,"Shot a crop-eared owl,"
616,_R. H._,For pigeon mistook:
617,_R. H._,
618,_R. H._,Caught her by the lax wing.
619,_R. H._,"--She, as she dies,"
620,_R. H._,Thrills his warm soul through
621,_R. H._,With her deep eyes.
622,_R. H._,
623,_R. H._,Corpse-eyes are eerie:
624,_R. H._,Tiger-eyes fierce:
625,_R. H._,John Fane Dingle found
626,_R. H._,Owl-eyes worse.
627,_R. H._,
628,_R. H._,"Owl-eyes on night-clouds,"
629,_R. H._,Constant as Fate:
630,_R. H._,Owl-eyes in baby's face:
631,_R. H._,On dish and plate:
632,_R. H._,
633,_R. H._,"Owl-eyes, without sound."
634,_R. H._,--Pale of hue

646,_R. H._,
647,_R. H._,Poets make faces
648,_R. H._,And sudden grimaces:
649,_R. H._,"They twit you, and spit you"
650,_R. H._,On words: then admit you
651,_R. H._,To heaven or hell
652,_R. H._,By the tales that they tell.
653,_R. H._,
654,_R. H._,Painters are gay
655,_R. H._,As young rabbits in May:
656,_R. H._,"They buy jolly mugs,"
657,_R. H._,"Bowls, pictures, and jugs:"
658,_R. H._,The things round their necks
659,_R. H._,"Are lively with checks,"
660,_R. H._,(For they like something red
661,_R. H._,As a frame for the head):
662,_R. H._,"Or they'll curse you with oaths,"
663,_R. H._,That tear holes in your clothes.
664,_R. H._,(With nothing to mend them
665,_R. H._,You'd best not offend them).

667,_R. H._,Puddings should be
668,_R. H._,"Full of currants, for me:"
669,_R. H._,"Boiled in a pail,"
670,_R. H._,Tied in the tail
671,_R. H._,Of an old bleached shirt:
672,_R. H._,"So hot that they hurt,"
673,_R. H._,So huge that they last
674,_R. H._,"From the dim, distant past"

701,_R. H._,
702,_R. H._,"Isaac knew great men,"

706,_R. H._,
707,_R. H._,Some still visit him;

710,_R. H._,The Lord knows why.
711,_R. H._,
712,_R. H._,"His grey beard is woolly,"

735,_R. H._,"Of deep cobbled streets wherein dray upon dray ever marches,"
736,_R. H._,"The sky is a broken lid, a litter of smashed yellow pieces."
737,_R. H._,
738,_R. H._,"To those under mouldering roofs, where life to an hour is crowded,"
739,_R. H._,"Life, to a span of the floor, to an inch of the light,"
740,_R. H._,"And night is all fevrous-hot, a time to be bawded and rowdied,"

742,_R. H._,
743,_R. H._,"Those who would live, do it quickly, with quick tears, sudden laughter,"

745,_R. H._,"Those who would die, do it quickly, with noose from the rafter,"
746,_R. H._,"Or the black shadowy eddies of Thames, the hurry-hater."
747,_R. H._,
748,_R. H._,"Life is the Master, the keen and grim destroyer of beauty:"
749,_R. H._,"Death is a quiet and deep reliever, where soul upon soul"

766,_R. H._,"Fold upon fold, the air laps my head."

768,_R. H._,Both eyes scorch: tongue stiff and bitter:
769,_R. H._,"Flies buzz, but no birds twitter:"
770,_R. H._,"Slow bullocks stand with stinging feet,"
771,_R. H._,And naked fishes scarcely stir for heat.
772,_R. H._,
773,_R. H._,"White as smoke,"
774,_R. H._,"As jetted steam, dead clouds awoke"
775,_R. H._,And quivered on the Western rim.
776,_R. H._,Then the singing started: dim
777,_R. H._,And sibilant as rime-stiff reeds
778,_R. H._,That whistle as the wind leads.
779,_R. H._,"The North answered, low and clear;"
780,_R. H._,"The South whispered hard and sere,"
781,_R. H._,And thunder muffled up like drums
782,_R. H._,"Beat, whence the East wind comes."
783,_R. H._,The heavy sky that could not weep
784,_R. H._,Is loosened: rain falls steep:
785,_R. H._,And thirty singing furies ride
786,_R. H._,To split the sky from side to side.
787,_R. H._,"They sing, and lash the wet-flanked wind:"
788,_R. H._,"Sing, from Col to Hafod Mynd"
789,_R. H._,And fling their voices half a score
790,_R. H._,Of miles along the mounded shore:
791,_R. H._,"Whip loud music from a tree,"
792,_R. H._,And roll their pæan out to sea
793,_R. H._,"Where crowded breakers fling and leap,"
794,_R. H._,And strange things throb five fathoms deep.
795,_R. H._,
796,_R. H._,The sudden tempest roared and died:
797,_R. H._,The singing furies muted ride
798,_R. H._,Down wet and slippery roads to hell:
799,_R. H._,"And, silent in their captors' train"
800,_R. H._,"Two fishers, storm-caught on the main;"
801,_R. H._,"A shepherd, battered with his flocks;"
802,_R. H._,A pit-boy tumbled from the rocks;
803,_R. H._,"A dozen back-broke gulls, and hosts"

815,_R. H._,Drips the blank roof: and the moss creeps after.
816,_R. H._,
817,_R. H._,Dead is the crumbled chimney: all mellowed to rotting
818,_R. H._,"The wall-tints, and the floor-tints, from the spotting"
819,_R. H._,"Of the rain, from the wind and slow appetite"
820,_R. H._,Of patient mould: and of the worms that bite
821,_R. H._,At beauty all their innumerable lives.
822,_R. H._,
823,_R. H._,"--But the sudden nip of knives,"
824,_R. H._,"The lady aching for her stiffening lord,"
825,_R. H._,The passionate-fearful bride
826,_R. H._,"And beaded pallor clamped to the torment-board,"
827,_R. H._,"--Leave they no ghosts, no memories by the stairs?"
828,_R. H._,No sheeted glimmer treading floorless ways?
829,_R. H._,"No haunting melody of lovers' airs,"
830,_R. H._,Nor stealthy chill upon the noon of days?
831,_R. H._,No: for the dead and senseless walls have long forgotten
832,_R. H._,What passionate hearts beneath the grass lie rotten.
833,_R. H._,
834,_R. H._,Only from roofs and chimneys pleasantly sliding
835,_R. H._,Tumbles the rain in the early hours:
836,_R. H._,"Patters its thousand feet on the flowers,"

850,_R. H._,See how the hill slants

1324,_R. H._,
1325,_R. H._,"A flawless tall mirror,"
1326,_R. H._,Glass dim and green;
1327,_R. H._,"And a tall, dim figure"
1328,_R. H._,There was between:
1329,_R. H._,
1330,_R. H._,"Pale, so pale her face"
1331,_R. H._,As veils of thin water;
1332,_R. H._,"And her eyes water-pale,"
1333,_R. H._,And the moonlight on her;
1334,_R. H._,
1335,_R. H._,"And she was dying, dying;"
1336,_R. H._,"She combed her long hair,"
1337,_R. H._,And the crimson blood ran
1338,_R. H._,In the fine gold there.
1339,_R. H._,
1340,_R. H._,"She was dying, dying ..."
1341,_R. H._,And in her perfect eye

1354,_R. H._,And the blind god's hands
1355,_R. H._,Grope at the pillars where he stands:

1366,_R. H._,"Snuffed are the tapers, and bitterly hang on the flowerless air:"
1367,_R. H._,"See: and this is the Image of her they will lay in the tomb,"
1368,_R. H._,"Clear, and waxen, and cooled in the mass of her hair."
