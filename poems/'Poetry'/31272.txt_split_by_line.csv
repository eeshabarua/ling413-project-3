1166,"""DEAR PAGE",
1167,"""DEAR PAGE","The death of his sister, his devotion to his books, and his"

1172,"""DEAR PAGE",
1173,"""DEAR PAGE",He went often to visit Mrs. Skelton who made her home with her father

1175,"""DEAR PAGE",out of the harmonies which came from the instrument and the lady's
1176,"""DEAR PAGE",spinet came the greater one of love.
1177,"""DEAR PAGE",
1178,"""DEAR PAGE","They were married in January of 1772. The ceremony took place at ""The"

1181,"""DEAR PAGE","graceful carriage. She was well educated, read a great deal, and"
1182,"""DEAR PAGE",played the spinet unusually well.
1183,"""DEAR PAGE",
1184,"""DEAR PAGE",The wedding journey was a strange one. It was a hundred miles from
1185,"""DEAR PAGE","""The Forest"" to Monticello, and years afterward their eldest daughter,"

1188,"""DEAR PAGE","""They left 'The Forest' after a fall of snow, light then,"
1189,"""DEAR PAGE",but increasing in depth as they advanced up the country.
1190,"""DEAR PAGE",They were finally obliged to quit the carriage and proceed
1191,"""DEAR PAGE","on horseback. They arrived late at night, the fires were all"
1192,"""DEAR PAGE","out, and the servants had retired to their own houses for"
1193,"""DEAR PAGE","the night. The horrible dreariness of such a house, at the"

1195,"""DEAR PAGE",
1196,"""DEAR PAGE","Yet, the walls of Monticello, that afterwards looked down upon so much"
1197,"""DEAR PAGE","sorrow and so much joy, must have long remembered the home-coming of"

1199,"""DEAR PAGE","""on a shelf behind some books,"" built a fire in the open fireplace,"
1200,"""DEAR PAGE","and ""they laughed and sang together like two children."""
1201,"""DEAR PAGE",
1202,"""DEAR PAGE",And that life upon the hills proved very nearly ideal. They walked and
1203,"""DEAR PAGE","planned and rode together, and kept house and garden books in the most"

1205,"""DEAR PAGE",
1206,"""DEAR PAGE","Births and deaths followed each other at Monticello, but there was"
1207,"""DEAR PAGE",nothing else to mar the peace of that happy home. Between husband and

1215,"""DEAR PAGE","They reared other children besides their own, taking the helpless"

5831,VII,"When asked why women wrote better novels than men, Mr. Richard Le"
5832,VII,"Gallienne is said to have replied, more or less conclusively, ""They"
5833,VII,"don't""; thus recalling _Punch's_ famous advice to those about to"
5834,VII,marry.
5835,VII,
5836,VII,"Happily there is no segregation in literature, and masculine and"
5837,VII,"feminine hands alike may dabble in fiction, as long as the publishers"
5838,VII,are willing.
5839,VII,
5840,VII,If we accept Zola's dictum to the effect that art is nature seen
5841,VII,"through the medium of a temperament, the thing is possible to many,"
5842,VII,though the achievement may differ both in manner and degree. For women
5843,VII,have temperament--too much of it--as the hysterical novelists daily
5844,VII,testify.
5845,VII,
5846,VII,"The gentleman novelist, however, prances in boldly, where feminine"
5847,VII,"feet well may fear to tread, and consequently has a wider scope for"
5848,VII,his writing. It is not for a woman to mingle in a barroom brawl and
5849,VII,"write of the thing as she sees it. The prize-ring, the interior of a"
5850,VII,"cattle-ship, Broadway at four in the morning--these and countless"
5851,VII,other places are forbidden by her innate refinement as well as by the
5852,VII,"Ladies' Own, and all the other aunties who have taken upon themselves"
5853,VII,the guardianship of the Home with a big H.
5854,VII,
5855,VII,Fancy the outpouring of scorn upon the luckless offender's head if one
5856,VII,should write to the Manners and Morals Department of the Ladies' Own
5857,VII,"as follows: ""Would it be proper for a lady novelist, in search of"
5858,VII,"local colour and new experiences, to accept the escort of a strange"
5859,VII,"man at midnight if he was too drunk to recognise her afterward?"" Yet a"
5860,VII,man in the same circumstances would not hesitate to put an intoxicated
5861,VII,"woman into a sea-going cab, and would plume himself for a year and a"
5862,VII,day upon his virtuous performance.
5863,VII,
5864,VII,All things are considered proper for a man who is about to write a
5865,VII,book. Like the disciple of Mary McLane who stole a horse in order to
5866,VII,"get the emotions of a police court, he may delve deeply not only into"
5867,VII,"life, but into that under-stratum which is not spoken of, where"
5868,VII,respectable journals circulate.
5869,VII,
5870,VII,"Everything is fish that comes into his net. If conscientious, he may"
5871,VII,even undertake marriage in order to study the feminine personal
5872,VII,"equations at close range. Woman's emotions, singly and collectively,"
5873,VII,are pilloried before his scientific gaze. He cowers before one
5874,VII,"problem, and one only--woman's clothes!"
5875,VII,
5876,VII,"Carlyle, after long and painful thought, arrives at the conclusion"
5877,VII,"that ""cut betokens intellect and talent; colour reveals temper and"
5878,VII,"heart."""
5879,VII,
5880,VII,"This reminds one of the language of flowers, and the directions given"
5881,VII,for postage-stamp flirtation. If that massive mind had penetrated
5882,VII,"further into the mysteries of the subject, we might have been told"
5883,VII,that a turnover collar indicated that the woman was a High Church
5884,VII,"Episcopalian who had embroidered two altar cloths, and that suède"
5885,VII,gloves show a yielding but contradictory nature.
5886,VII,
5887,VII,"Clothes are, undoubtedly, indices of character and taste, as well as a"
5888,VII,"sop to conventionality, but this only when one has the wherewithal to"
5889,VII,browse at will in the department store. Many a woman with ermine
5890,VII,"tastes has only a rabbit-fur pocket-book, and thus her clothes wrong"
5891,VII,"her in the sight of gods and women, though men know nothing about it."
5892,VII,
5893,VII,Once upon a time there was a notion to the effect that women dressed
5894,VII,"to please men, but that idea has long since been relegated to the"
5895,VII,limbo of forgotten things.

5897,VII,Not one man in a thousand can tell the difference between Brussels

5900,VII,"the busy bargain basement."""
5901,VII,
5902,VII,"But across the room, yea, even from across the street, the eagle eye"
5903,VII,of another woman can unerringly locate the Brussels point and the
5904,VII,mock Valenciennes.
5905,VII,
5906,VII,A man knows silk by the sound of it and diamonds by the shine. He will
5907,VII,"say that his heroine ""was richly dressed in silk."" Little does he wot"
5908,VII,of the difference between taffeta at eighty-five cents a yard and
5909,VII,broadcloth at four dollars. Still less does he know that a white
5910,VII,"cotton shirt-waist represents financial ease, and a silk waist of"
5911,VII,"festive colouring represents poverty, since it takes but two days to"
5912,VII,"""do up"" a white shirt-waist in one sense, and thirty or forty cents to"
5913,VII,do it up in the other!
5914,VII,
5915,VII,One listens with wicked delight to men's discourse upon woman's
5916,VII,clothes. Now and then a man will express his preference for a tailored
5917,VII,"gown, as being eminently simple and satisfactory. Unless he is married"
5918,VII,"and has seen the bills for tailored gowns, he also thinks they are"
5919,VII,inexpensive.
5920,VII,
5921,VII,"It is the benedict, wise with the acquired knowledge of the serpent,"
5922,VII,who begs his wife to get a new party gown and let the tailor-made go
5923,VII,"until next season. He also knows that when the material is bought, the"
5924,VII,"expense has scarcely begun, whereas the ignorant bachelor thinks that"
5925,VII,the worst is happily over.
5926,VII,
5927,VII,In _A Little Journey through the World_ Mr. Warner philosophised thus:
5928,VII,"""How a woman in a crisis hesitates before her wardrobe, and at last"
5929,VII,"chooses just what will express her innermost feelings!"""
5930,VII,
5931,VII,"If all a woman's feelings were to be expressed by her clothes, the"
5932,VII,benedicts would immediately encounter financial shipwreck. On account
5933,VII,"of the lamentable scarcity of money and closets, one is eternally"
5934,VII,adjusting the emotion to the gown.
5935,VII,
5936,VII,"Some gown, seen at the exact psychological moment, fixes forever in a"
5937,VII,"man's mind his ideal garment. Thus we read of blue calico, of"
5938,VII,"pink-and-white print, and more often still, of white lawn. Mad colour"
5939,VII,"combinations run riot in the masculine fancy, as in the case of a man"
5940,VII,"who boldly described his favourite costume as ""red, with black ruffles"
5941,VII,"down the front!"""
5942,VII,
5943,VII,"Of a hat, a man may be a surpassingly fine critic, since he recks not"
5944,VII,of style. Guileful is the woman who leads her liege to the millinery
5945,VII,"and lets him choose, taking no heed of the price and the attendant"
5946,VII,shock until later.
5947,VII,
5948,VII,A normal man is anxious that his wife shall be well dressed because it
5949,VII,shows the critical observer that his business is a great success.
5950,VII,"After futile explorations in the labyrinth, he concerns himself simply"
5951,VII,"with the fit, preferring always that the clothes of his heart's"
5952,VII,"dearest shall cling to her as lovingly as a kid glove, regardless of"
5953,VII,the pouches and fulnesses prescribed by Dame Fashion.
5954,VII,
5955,VII,"In the writing of books, men are at their wits' end when it comes to"
5956,VII,women's clothes. They are hampered by no restrictions--no thought of
5957,VII,"style or period enters into their calculations, and unless they have a"
5958,VII,"wholesome fear of the unknown theme, they produce results which"
5959,VII,further international gaiety.
5960,VII,
5961,VII,"Many an outrageous garment has been embalmed in a man's book, simply"
5962,VII,because an attractive woman once wore something like it when she fed
5963,VII,"the novelist. Unbalanced by the joy of the situation, he did not"
5964,VII,"accurately observe the garb of the ministering angel, and hence we"
5965,VII,"read of ""a clinging white gown"" in the days of stiff silks and rampant"
5966,VII,"crinoline; of ""the curve of the upper arm"" when it took five yards for"
5967,VII,"a pair of sleeves, and of ""short walking skirts"" during the reign of"
5968,VII,bustles and trains!
5969,VII,
5970,VII,"In _The Blazed Trail_, Mr. White observes that his heroine was clad in"
5971,VII,brown which fitted her slender figure perfectly. As Hilda had yellow
5972,VII,"hair, ""like corn silk,"" this was all right, and if the brown was of"
5973,VII,"the proper golden shade, she was doubtless stunning when Thorpe first"
5974,VII,saw her in the forest. But the gown could not have fitted her as the
5975,VII,"sheath encases the dagger, for before the straight-front corsets there"
5976,VII,"were the big sleeves, and still further back were bustles and"
5977,VII,_bouffant_ draperies. One does not get the impression that _The_
5978,VII,"_Blazed Trail_ was placed in the days of crinolines, but doubtless"
5979,VII,Hilda's clothes did not fit as Mr. White seems to think they did.
5980,VII,
5981,VII,"That strenuous follower of millinery, Mr. Gibson, might give lessons"
5982,VII,"to his friend, Mr. Davis, with advantage to the writer, if not to the"
5983,VII,"artist. In _Captain Macklin_, the young man's cousin makes her first"
5984,VII,"appearance in a thin gown, and a white hat trimmed with roses,"
5985,VII,"reminding the adventurous captain of a Dresden statuette, in spite of"
5986,VII,the fact that she wore heavy gauntlet gloves and carried a trowel. The
5987,VII,lady had been doing a hard day's work in the garden. No woman outside
5988,VII,"the asylum ever did gardening in such a costume, and Mr. Davis"
5989,VII,evidently has the hat and gown sadly mixed with some other pleasant
5990,VII,impression.
5991,VII,
5992,VII,The feminine reader immediately hides Mr. Davis' mistake with the
5993,VII,"broad mantle of charity, and in her own mind clothes Beatrice properly"
5994,VII,"in a short walking skirt, heavy shoes, shirt-waist, old hat tied down"
5995,VII,"over the ears with a rumpled ribbon, and a pair of ancient masculine"
5996,VII,"gloves, long since discarded by their rightful owner. Thus does lovely"
5997,VII,"woman garden, except on the stage and in men's books."
5998,VII,
5999,VII,"In _The Story of Eva_, Mr. Payne announces that Eva climbed out of a"
6000,VII,"cab in ""a fawn-coloured jacket,"" conspicuous by reason of its newness,"
6001,VII,"and a hat ""with an owl's head upon it!"""
6002,VII,
6003,VII,The jacket was possibly a coat of tan covert cloth with strapped
6004,VII,"seams, but it is the startling climax which claims attention. An owl!"
6005,VII,"Surely not, Mr. Payne! It may have been a parrot, for once upon a"
6006,VII,"time, before the Audubon Society met with widespread recognition,"
6007,VII,"women wore such things, and at afternoon teas where many fair"
6008,VII,ones were gathered together the parrot garniture was not without
6009,VII,"significance. But an owl's face, with its glaring glassy eyes, is"
6010,VII,"too much like a pussy cat's to be appropriate, and one could no"
6011,VII,wear it at the back without conveying an unpleasant impression
6012,VII,"of two-facedness, if the coined word be permissible."
6013,VII,
6014,VII,Still the owl is no worse than the trimming suggested by a funny
6015,VII,paper. The tears of mirth come yet at the picture of a hat of rough
6016,VII,"straw, shaped like a nest, on which sat a full-fledged Plymouth Rock"
6017,VII,"hen, with her neck proudly, yet graciously curved. Perhaps Mr. Payne"
6018,VII,saw the picture and forthwith decided to do something in the same
6019,VII,"line, but there is a singular inappropriateness in placing the bird of"
6020,VII,"Minerva upon the head of poor Eva, who made the old, old bargain in"
6021,VII,"which she had everything to lose, and nothing save the bitterest"
6022,VII,"experience to gain. A stuffed kitten, so young and innocent that its"
6023,VII,"eyes were still blue and bleary, would have been more appropriate on"
6024,VII,"Eva's bonnet, and just as pretty."
6025,VII,
6026,VII,"In _The Fortunes of Oliver Horn_, Margaret Grant wears a particularly"
6027,VII,striking costume:
6028,VII,
6029,VII,"""The cloth skirt came to her ankles, which were covered with"
6030,VII,"yarn stockings, and her feet were encased in shoes that gave"
6031,VII,"him the shivers, the soles being as thick as his own and"
6032,VII,the leather as tough.
6033,VII,
6034,VII,"""Her blouse was of grey flannel, belted to the waist by a"
6035,VII,"cotton saddle-girth, white and red, and as broad as her"
6036,VII,"hand. The tam-o-shanter was coarse and rough, evidently"
6037,VII,"home-made, and not at all like McFudd's, which was as soft"
6038,VII,"as the back of a kitten and without a seam."""
6039,VII,
6040,VII,"With all due respect to Mr. Smith, one must insist that Margaret's"
6041,VII,shoes were all right as regards material and build. She would have
6042,VII,"been more comfortable if they had been ""high-necked"" shoes, and, in"
6043,VII,"that case, the yarn hosiery would not have troubled him, but that is a"
6044,VII,"minor detail. The quibble comes at the belt, and knowing that Margaret"
6045,VII,"was an artist, we must be sure that Mr. Smith was mistaken. It may"
6046,VII,"have been one of the woven cotton belts, not more than two inches"
6047,VII,"wide, which, for a dizzy moment, were at the height of fashion, and"
6048,VII,"then tottered and fell, but a ""saddle-girth""--never!"
6049,VII,
6050,VII,"In that charming morceau, _The Inn of the Silver Moon_, Mr. Viele puts"
6051,VII,his heroine into plaid stockings and green knickerbockers--an
6052,VII,"outrageous costume truly, even for wheeling."
6053,VII,
6054,VII,"As if recognising his error, and, with veritable masculine"
6055,VII,"stubbornness, refusing to admit it, Mr. Viele goes on to say that the"
6056,VII,"knickerbockers were ""tailor-made!"" And thereby he makes a bad matter"
6057,VII,very much worse.
6058,VII,
6059,VII,"In _The Wings of the Morning_, Iris, in spite of the storm through"
6060,VII,"which the _Sirdar_ vainly attempts to make its way, appears throughout"
6061,VII,"in a ""lawn dress""--white, undoubtedly, since all sorts and conditions"
6062,VII,of men profess to admire white lawn!
6063,VII,
6064,VII,How cold the poor girl must have been! And even if she could have been
6065,VII,"so inappropriately gowned on shipboard, she had plenty of time to put"
6066,VII,on a warm and suitable tailor-made gown before she was shipwrecked.
6067,VII,"This is sheer fatuity, for any one with Mr. Tracy's abundant ingenuity"
6068,VII,could easily have contrived ruin for the tailored gown in time for
6069,VII,Iris to assume masculine garb and participate bravely in that fearful
6070,VII,fight on the ledge.
6071,VII,
6072,VII,"Whence, oh whence, comes this fondness for lawn? Are not organdies,"
6073,VII,"dimities, and embroidered muslins fully as becoming to the women who"
6074,VII,trip daintily through the pages of men's books? Lawn has been a back
6075,VII,"number for many a weary moon, and still we read of it!"
6076,VII,
6077,VII,"""When in doubt, lead trumps,"" might well be paraphrased thus: ""When in"
6078,VII,"doubt, put her into white lawn!"" Even ""J. P. M.,"" that gentle spirit"
6079,VII,"to whom so many hidden things were revealed, sent his shrewish ""Kate"""
6080,VII,"off for a canter through the woods in a white gown, and, if memory"
6081,VII,"serves, it was lawn!"
6082,VII,
6083,VII,"In _The Master_, Mr. Zangwill describes Eleanor Wyndwood as ""the"
6084,VII,"radiant apparition of a beautiful woman in a shimmering amber gown,"
6085,VII,"from which her shoulders rose dazzling."""
6086,VII,
6087,VII,"So far so good. But a page or two farther on, that delightful minx,"
6088,VII,"Olive Regan, wears ""a dress of soft green-blue cut high, with yellow"
6089,VII,"roses at the throat."" One wonders whether Mr. Zangwill ever really saw"
6090,VII,"a woman in any kind of a gown ""with yellow roses at the throat,"" or"
6091,VII,whether it is but the slip of an overstrained fancy. The fact that he
6092,VII,has married since writing this gives a goodly assurance that by this
6093,VII,time he knows considerably more about gowns.
6094,VII,
6095,VII,"Still there is always a chance that the charm may not work, for Mr."
6096,VII,"Arthur Stringer, who has been reported as being married to a very"
6097,VII,"lovely woman, takes astonishing liberties in _The Silver Poppy_:"
6098,VII,

6100,VII,"breath of open morning itself, a confusion of mellow"
6101,VII,"autumnal colours in her wine-coloured gown, and a hat of"
6102,VII,roses and mottled leaves.
6103,VII,
6104,VII,"""Before she had as much as drawn off her gloves--and they"
6105,VII,were always the most spotless of white gloves--she glanced
6106,VII,"about in mock dismay, and saw that the last of the righting"
6107,VII,"up had already been done."""
6108,VII,
6109,VII,"Later, we read that the artist pinned an American Beauty upon her"
6110,VII,"gown, then shook his head over the colour combination and took it"
6111,VII,"off. If the American Beauty jarred enough for a man to notice it, the"
6112,VII,"dress must have been the colour of claret, or Burgundy, rather than"
6113,VII,the clear soft gold of sauterne.
6114,VII,
6115,VII,This brings us up with a short turn before the hat. What colour were
6116,VII,"the roses? Surely they were not American Beauties, and they could not"
6117,VII,"have been pink. Yellow roses would have been a fright, so they must"
6118,VII,"have been white ones, and a hat covered with white roses is altogether"
6119,VII,too festive to wear in the morning. The white gloves also would have
6120,VII,been sadly out of place.
6121,VII,
6122,VII,What a comfort it would be to all concerned if the feminine reader
6123,VII,could take poor Cordelia one side and fix her up a bit! One could pat
6124,VII,"the artistic disorder out of her beautiful yellow hair, help her out"
6125,VII,"of her hideous clothes into a grey tailor-made, with a shirt-waist of"
6126,VII,"mercerised white cheviot, put on a stock of the same material, give"
6127,VII,"her a ""ready-to-wear"" hat of the same trig-tailored quality, and, as"
6128,VII,"she passed out, hand her a pair of grey suède gloves which exactly"
6129,VII,matched her gown.
6130,VII,
6131,VII,"Though grey would be more becoming, she might wear tan as a concession"
6132,VII,"to Mr. Stringer, who evidently likes yellow."
6133,VII,
6134,VII,"In the same book, we find a woman who gathers up her ""yellow skirts"""
6135,VII,and goes down a ladder. It might have been only a yellow taffeta
6136,VII,"drop-skirt under tan etamine, but we must take his word for it, as we"
6137,VII,did not see it and he did.
6138,VII,
6139,VII,"As the Chinese keep the rat tails for the end of the feast, the worst"
6140,VII,clothes to be found in any book must come last by way of climax. Mr.
6141,VII,"Dixon, in _The Leopard's Spots_, has easily outdone every other knight"
6142,VII,of the pen who has entered the lists to portray women's clothes.
6143,VII,Listen to the inspired description of Miss Sallie's gown!
6144,VII,
6145,VII,"""She was dressed in a morning gown of a soft red material,"
6146,VII,trimmed with old cream lace. The material of a woman's dress
6147,VII,"had never interested him before. He knew calico from silk,"
6148,VII,but beyond that he never ventured an opinion. To colour
6149,VII,alone he was responsive. This combination of red and creamy
6150,VII,"white, _with the bodice cut low, showing the lines of her"
6151,VII,"beautiful white shoulders_, and the great mass of dark hair"
6152,VII,"rising in graceful curves from her full round neck,"
6153,VII,heightened her beauty to an extraordinary degree.
6154,VII,
6155,VII,"""As she walked, the clinging folds of her dress, outlining"
6156,VII,"her queenly figure, seemed part of her very being, and to be"
6157,VII,imbued with her soul. He was dazzled with the new revelation
6158,VII,"of her power over him."""
6159,VII,
6160,VII,"The fact that she goes for a ride later on, ""dressed in pure white,"""
6161,VII,sinks into insignificance beside this new and original creation of Mr.
6162,VII,"Dixon's. A red morning gown, trimmed with cream lace, cut low enough"
6163,VII,"to show the ""beautiful white shoulders""--ye gods and little fishes!"
6164,VII,"Where were the authorities, and why was not ""Miss Sallie"" taken to the"

6166,VII,
6167,VII,"It would seem that any man, especially one who writes books, could be"
6168,VII,sure of a number of women friends. Among these there ought to be at
6169,VII,least one whom he could take into his confidence. The gentleman
6170,VII,"novelist might go to the chosen one and say: ""My heroine, in moderate"
6171,VII,"circumstances, is going to the matinée with a girl friend. What shall"
6172,VII,"she wear?"""
6173,VII,
6174,VII,Instantly the discerning woman would ask the colour of her eyes and
6175,VII,"hair, and the name of the town she lived in, then behold!"
6176,VII,
6177,VII,"Upon the writer's page would come a radiant feminine vision, clothed"
6178,VII,"in her right mind and in proper clothes, to the joy of every woman who"
6179,VII,reads the book.
6180,VII,
6181,VII,"But men are proverbially chary of their confidence, except when they"
6182,VII,"are in love, and being in love is supposed to put even book women out"
6183,VII,of a man's head. Perhaps in the new Schools of Journalism which are to
6184,VII,"be inaugurated, there will be supplementary courses in millinery"
6185,VII,"elective, for those who wish to learn the trade of novel writing."
6186,VII,
6187,VII,If a man knows no woman to whom he can turn for counsel and advice at
6188,VII,"the critical point in his book, there are only two courses open to"
6189,VII,"him, aside from the doubtful one of evasion. He may let his fancy run"
6190,VII,riot and put his heroine into clothes that would give even a dumb
6191,VII,"woman hysterics, or he may follow the example of Mr. Chatfield-Taylor,"
6192,VII,"who says of one of his heroines that ""her pliant body was enshrouded"

6194,VII,
6195,VII,"Lacking the faithful hench-woman who would gladly put them straight,"
6196,VII,"the majority of gentlemen novelists evade the point, and, so far as"

6239,VII,The Technique of the Short Story
6240,VII,
6241,VII,
6242,VII,"An old rule for those who would be well-dressed says: ""When you have"
6243,VII,"finished, go to the mirror and see what you can take off."" The same"
6244,VII,"rule applies with equal force to the short story: ""When you have"
6245,VII,"written it out, go over it carefully, and see what you can take out."""
6246,VII,
6247,VII,"Besides being the best preparation for the writing of novels,"
6248,VII,"short-story writing is undoubtedly, at the present time, the best"
6249,VII,paying and most satisfactory form of any ephemeral literary work. The
6250,VII,qualities which make it successful are to be attained only by constant
6251,VII,"and patient practice. The real work of writing a story may be brief,"
6252,VII,"but years of preparation must be worked through before a manuscript,"
6253,VII,"which may be written in an hour or so, can present an artistic result."
6254,VII,
6255,VII,The first and most important thing to consider is the central idea.
6256,VII,"There are only a few ideas in the world, but their ramifications are"
6257,VII,"countless, and one need never despair of a theme. Your story may be"
6258,VII,"one of either failure or success, but it must have the true ring."
6259,VII,"Given the man and the circumstances, we should know his action."
6260,VII,
6261,VII,The plot must unfold naturally; otherwise it will be a succession of
6262,VII,"distinct sensations, rather than a complete and harmonious whole."
6263,VII,
6264,VII,There is no better way to produce this effect than to follow Edmund
6265,VII,"Russell's rule of colour in dress: ""When a contrasting colour is"
6266,VII,"introduced, there should be at least two subordinate repetitions of"
6267,VII,"it."""
6268,VII,
6269,VII,"Each character should appear, or be spoken of, at least twice before"
6270,VII,his main action. Following this rule makes one of the differences
6271,VII,between artistic and sensational literature.
6272,VII,
6273,VII,The heroine of a dime novel always finds a hero to rescue her in the
6274,VII,"nick of time, and perhaps she never sees him again. In the artistic"
6275,VII,"novel, while the heroine may see the rescuer first at the time she"
6276,VII,"needs him most, he never disappears altogether from the story."
6277,VII,
6278,VII,Description is a thing which is much abused. There is no truer
6279,VII,indication of an inexperienced hand than a story beginning with a
6280,VII,description of a landscape which is not necessary to the plot. If the
6281,VII,peculiarities of the scenery must be understood before the idea can be
6282,VII,"developed, the briefest possible description is not out of place."
6283,VII,"Subjectively, a touch of landscape or weather is allowable, but it"
6284,VII,must be purely incidental. Weather is a very common thing and is apt
6285,VII,to be uninteresting.
6286,VII,
6287,VII,It is a mistake to tell anything yourself which the people in the
6288,VII,story could inform the reader without your assistance. A conversation
6289,VII,between two people will bring out all the facts necessary as well as
6290,VII,two pages of narration by the author.
6291,VII,
6292,VII,There is a way also of telling things from the point of view of the
6293,VII,persons which they concern. Those who have studied Latin will find
6294,VII,"the ""indirect discourse"" of Cicero a useful model."
6295,VII,
6296,VII,The people in the story can tell their own peculiarities better than
6297,VII,the author can do it for them. It is not necessary to say that a woman
6298,VII,"is a snarling, grumpy person. Bring the old lady in, and let her"
6299,VII,"snarl, if she is in your story at all."
6300,VII,
6301,VII,The choice of words is not lightly to be considered. Never use two
6302,VII,"adjectives where one will do, or a weak word where a stronger one is"
6303,VII,"possible. Fallows' _100,000 Synonyms and Antonyms_ and Roget's"
6304,VII,_Thesaurus of Words and Phrases_ will prove invaluable to those who
6305,VII,wish to improve themselves in this respect.
6306,VII,
6307,VII,Analysis of sentences which seem to you particularly strong is a good
6308,VII,"way to strengthen your vocabulary. Take, for instance, the oft-quoted"
6309,VII,"expression of George Eliot's: ""Inclination snatches argument to make"
6310,VII,"indulgence seem judicious choice."" Substitute ""takes"" for ""snatches"""
6311,VII,"and read the sentence again. Leave out ""seem"" and put ""appear"" in its"
6312,VII,"place. ""Proper"" is a synonym for ""judicious""; substitute it, and put"
6313,VII,"""selection"" in the place of ""choice."""
6314,VII,
6315,VII,"Reading the sentence again we have: ""Inclination takes argument to"
6316,VII,"make indulgence appear proper selection."" The strength is wholly gone"
6317,VII,although the meaning is unchanged.
6318,VII,
6319,VII,"Find out what you want to say, and then say it, in the most direct"
6320,VII,English at your command. One of the best models of concise expressions
6321,VII,of thought is to be found in the essays of Emerson. He compresses a
6322,VII,"whole world into a single sentence, and a system of philosophy into an"
6323,VII,epigram.
6324,VII,
6325,VII,"""Literary impressionism,"" which is largely the use of onomatopoetic"
6326,VII,"words, is a valuable factor in the artistic short story. It is"
6327,VII,possible to convey the impression of a threatening sky and a stormy
6328,VII,sea without doing more than alluding to the crash of the surf against
6329,VII,the shore. The mind of the reader accustomed to subtle touches will at
6330,VII,once picture the rest.
6331,VII,
6332,VII,An element of strength is added also by occasionally referring an
6333,VII,"impression to another sense. For instance, the newspaper poet writes:"
6334,VII,"""The street was white with snow,"" and makes his line commonplace"
6335,VII,"doggerel. Tennyson says: ""The streets were _dumb_ with snow,"" and his"
6336,VII,line is poetry.
6337,VII,
6338,VII,"""Blackening the background"" is a common fault with story writers. In"
6339,VII,"many of the Italian operas, everybody who does not appear in the final"
6340,VII,scene is killed off in the middle of the last act. This wholesale
6341,VII,"slaughter is useless as well as inartistic. The true artist does not,"
6342,VII,"in order that his central figure may stand out prominently, make his"
6343,VII,"background a solid wall of gloom. Yet gloom has its proper place, as"
6344,VII,well as joy.
6345,VII,
6346,VII,"In the old tragedies of the Greeks, just before the final catastrophe,"
6347,VII,the chorus is supposed to advance to the centre of the theatre and
6348,VII,sing a bacchanal of frensied exultation.
6349,VII,
6350,VII,"In the _Antigone_ of Sophocles, just before the death of Antigone and"
6351,VII,"her lover, the chorus sings an ode which makes one wonder at its"
6352,VII,"extravagant expression. When the catastrophe occurs, the mystery is"
6353,VII,explained. Sophocles meant the sacrifice of Antigone to come home with
6354,VII,its full force; and well he attained his end by use of an artistic
6355,VII,method which few of our writers are subtle enough to recognise and
6356,VII,claim for their own purposes.
6357,VII,
6358,VII,"""High-sounding sentences,"" which an inexperienced writer is apt to put"
6359,VII,"into the mouths of his people, only make them appear ridiculous. The"
6360,VII,"schoolgirl in the story is too apt to say: ""The day has been most"
6361,VII,"unpleasant,"" whereas the real schoolgirl throws her books down with a"
6362,VII,"bang, and declares that she has ""had a perfectly horrid time!"""
6363,VII,
6364,VII,"Her grammar may be incorrect, but her method of expression is true to"
6365,VII,"life, and there the business of the writer ends."
6366,VII,
6367,VII,Put yourself in your hero's place and see what you would do under
6368,VII,"similar circumstances. If you were in love with a young woman, you"
6369,VII,"wouldn't get down on your knees, and swear by all that was holy that"
6370,VII,"you would die if she didn't marry you, at the same time tearing your"
6371,VII,"hair out by handfuls, and then endeavour to give her a concise"
6372,VII,biography of yourself.
6373,VII,
6374,VII,"You would put your arm around her, the first minute you had her to"
6375,VII,"yourself, if you felt reasonably sure that she cared for you, and tell"
6376,VII,her what she meant to you--perhaps so low that even the author of the
6377,VII,"story couldn't hear what you said, and would have to describe what"
6378,VII,he saw afterward in order to let his reader guess what had really
6379,VII,happened.
6380,VII,
6381,VII,It is a lamentable fact that the description of a person's features
6382,VII,gives absolutely no idea of his appearance. It is better to give a
6383,VII,"touch or two, and let the imagination do the rest. ""Hair like raven's"
6384,VII,"wing,"" and the ""midnight eyes,"" and many similar things, may be very"
6385,VII,well spared. The personal charms of the lover may be brought out
6386,VII,"through the mediations of the lovee, much better than by pages of"
6387,VII,description.
6388,VII,
6389,VII,The law of compensation must always have its place in the artistic
6390,VII,story. Those who do wrong must suffer wrong--those who work must be
6391,VII,"rewarded, if not in the tangible things they seek, at least in the"
6392,VII,"conscious strength that comes from struggling. And ""poetic justice,"""
6393,VII,"which metes out to those who do the things that they have done, is"
6394,VII,"relentless and eternal, in art, as well as in life."
6395,VII,
6396,VII,"""Style"" is purely an individual matter, and, if it is anything at all,"
6397,VII,"it is the expression of one's self. Zola has said that, ""art is nature"
6398,VII,"seen through the medium of a temperament,"" and the same is true of"
6399,VII,literature. Bunner's stories are as thoroughly Bunner as the man who
6400,VII,"wrote them, and _The Badge of Courage_ is nothing unless it be the"
6401,VII,"moody, sensitive, half-morbid Stephen Crane."
6402,VII,
6403,VII,Observation of things nearest at hand and the sympathetic
6404,VII,understanding of people are the first requisites. Do not place the
6405,VII,"scene of a story in Europe if you have never been there, and do not"
6406,VII,assume to comprehend the inner life of a Congressman if you have never
6407,VII,seen one. Do not write of mining camps if you have never seen a
6408,VII,"mountain, or of society if you have never worn evening dress."
6409,VII,
6410,VII,James Whitcomb Riley has made himself loved and honoured by writing of
6411,VII,"the simple things of home, and Louisa Alcott's name is a household"
6412,VII,word because she wrote of the little women whom she knew. Eugene Field
6413,VII,"has written of the children that he loved and understood, and won"
6414,VII,a truer fame than if he had undertaken _The Master_ of Zangwill.
6415,VII,Kipling's life in India has given us _Plain Tales from the Hills_ and
6416,VII,"_The Jungle Book_, which Mary E. Wilkins could not have written in"
6417,VII,spite of the genius which made her New England stories the most
6418,VII,effective of their kind. Joel Chandler Harris could not have written
6419,VII,"_The Prisoner of Zenda_, but those of us who have enjoyed the wiles of"
6420,VII,"that ""monstus soon beast, Brer Rabbit,"" would not have it otherwise."

6424,VII,"You cannot write of love unless you have loved, of suffering unless"
6425,VII,"you have suffered, or of death unless some one who was near to you has"
6426,VII,learned the heavenly secret. A little touch of each must teach you the
6427,VII,"full meaning of the great thing you mean to write about, or your work"
6428,VII,will be lacking. There are few of us to whom the great experiences do
6429,VII,"not come sooner or later, and, in the meantime, there are the little"
6430,VII,"everyday happenings, which are full of sweetness and help, if they are"
6431,VII,"only seen properly, to last until the great things come to test our"
6432,VII,"utmost strength, to crush us if we are not strong, and to make us"
6433,VII,"broader, better men and women if we withstand the blow."
6434,VII,
6435,VII,"And lastly, remember this, that merit is invariably recognised. If"
6436,VII,"your stories are worth printing, they will fight their way through"
6437,VII,"""the abundance of material on hand."" The light of the public square"
6438,VII,"is the unfailing test, and a good story is sure to be published"
6439,VII,"sooner or later, if a fair amount of literary instinct is exercised in"
6440,VII,"sending it out. Meteoric success is not desirable. Slow, hard,"
6441,VII,"conscientious work will surely win its way, and those who are now near"
6442,VII,the bottom of the ladder are gradually ascending to make room for the

6479,VII,Writing a Book
6480,VII,
6481,VII,
6482,VII,Having written a few small books which have been published by a
6483,VII,"reputable house, and which have been pleasantly received by both the"
6484,VII,"press and the public, and having just completed another which I"
6485,VII,"devoutly pray may meet the same fate, I feel that I may henceforth"
6486,VII,deem myself an author.
6487,VII,
6488,VII,I have been considered such for some time among my numerous
6489,VII,acquaintances ever since I made my literary bow with a short story
6490,VII,"in a literary magazine, years and years ago. Being of the feminine"
6491,VII,"persuasion, I am usually presented to strangers as ""an authoress."" It"
6492,VII,is at these times that I wish I were a man.
6493,VII,
6494,VII,The social side of authorship is extremely interesting. At least once
6495,VII,"a week, I am asked how I ""came to write."""
6496,VII,
6497,VII,"This is difficult, for I do not know. When I so reply, my questioner"
6498,VII,ascertains by further inquiries where I was educated and how I have
6499,VII,"been trained. Never having been through a ""School of Journalism,"" my"
6500,VII,answer is not satisfactory.
6501,VII,
6502,VII,"""You must read a great deal in order to get all those ideas,"" is"
6503,VII,"frequently said to me. I reply that I do read a great deal, being"
6504,VII,"naturally bookish, but that it is the great object of my life to avoid"
6505,VII,"getting ideas from books. To an author, ""Plagiarist"" is like the old"
6506,VII,"cry of ""Wolf,"" and when an idea is once assimilated it is difficult"
6507,VII,indeed to distinguish it from one's own.
6508,VII,
6509,VII,I am often asked how long it takes me to write a book. I am ashamed to
6510,VII,"tell, but sometimes the secret escapes, since I am naturally truthful,"
6511,VII,and find it hard to parry a direct question. The actual time of
6512,VII,"composition is always greeted with astonishment, and I can read the"
6513,VII,"questioner's inference, that if I can do so much in so short a time,"
6514,VII,how much could I do if I actually worked!
6515,VII,
6516,VII,"This is always distasteful, so I hasten to add that the composition"
6517,VII,"is really a very small part of the real writing of a book, and that"
6518,VII,authors' methods differ. My own practice is not to begin to write
6519,VII,"until my material is fully arranged in my mind, and I often use notes"
6520,VII,which I have been making for a period of months. Such a report is
6521,VII,"seldom convincing, however, to my questioners. I am gradually"
6522,VII,"learning, when this inquiry comes, to smile inscrutably."
6523,VII,
6524,VII,It seems strange to many people that I do not work all the time. If I
6525,VII,can write a short story in two hours and be paid thirty dollars for
6526,VII,"it, I am an idiot indeed if I do not write at least three in a day!"
6527,VII,Ninety dollars a day might easily mount up into a very comfortable
6528,VII,income.
6529,VII,
6530,VII,"Still, there are some who understand that an author cannot write"
6531,VII,continuously any more than a spider or a silkworm can spin all the
6532,VII,"time. These people ask me when, and where, and how, I get my"
6533,VII,material.
6534,VII,
6535,VII,"""Getting material"" is supposed to be a secret process, and I am"
6536,VII,thought a gay deceiver when I say I make no particular effort to get
6537,VII,it--that it comes in the daily living--like the morning cream! I am
6538,VII,"then asked if I rely wholly upon ""inspiration."" I answer that"
6539,VII,"""inspiration"" doubtless has its value as well as hard work, and that"
6540,VII,the author who would derive all possible benefit from the rare flashes
6541,VII,of it must have the same command of technique that a good workman has
6542,VII,of his tools.
6543,VII,
6544,VII,The majority learn with surprise that there is more to a book than is
6545,VII,self-evident. It was once my happy lot to put this fact into the
6546,VII,understanding of a lady from the country.
6547,VII,
6548,VII,"With infinite pains I told her of the constant study of words,"
6549,VII,"illustrated the fine shades of distinction between synonyms, spoke of"
6550,VII,"the different ways in which characters and events might be introduced,"
6551,VII,and of the subordinate repetition of contrasting themes. She listened
6552,VII,"in breathless wonder, and then turned to her daughter: ""There, Mame,"""
6553,VII,"she said, ""I told you there was something in it!"""
6554,VII,
6555,VII,There is nothing so pathetic as the widespread literary ambition among
6556,VII,people whose future is utterly hopeless. It is sad enough for one who
6557,VII,"has attained a small success to see the heights which are ever beyond,"
6558,VII,and it makes one gentle indeed to those who come seeking aid.
6559,VII,
6560,VII,One ambitious soul once asked me if I would teach her to write. I
6561,VII,"replied that I did not know of any way in which it could be taught,"
6562,VII,but that I would gladly help her if I could. She said she had
6563,VII,"absolutely no imagination, and asked me if that would make any"
6564,VII,difference. I told her it was certainly an unfortunate circumstance
6565,VII,and advised her to cultivate that quality before she attempted
6566,VII,"extensive writing. I suppose she is still doing it, for I have not"
6567,VII,been asked for further assistance.
6568,VII,
6569,VII,People often inquire what qualities I deem essential to literary
6570,VII,"success. Imagination is, of course, the first, observation, the"
6571,VII,"second, and ambition, perseverance and executive ability are"
6572,VII,"indispensable. Besides these I would place the sense of humour, of"
6573,VII,"proportion, sympathy, insight,--indeed, there is nothing admirable in"
6574,VII,human nature which would come amiss in the equipment of a writer.
6575,VII,
6576,VII,The necessity for the humourous sense was recently brought home to me
6577,VII,most forcibly. A woman brought me the manuscript of a novel which she
6578,VII,"asked me to read. She felt that something was wrong with it, but she"
6579,VII,"did not know just what it was. She said it needed ""a few little"
6580,VII,"touches,"" she thought, such as my experience would have fitted me to"
6581,VII,"give, and she would be grateful, indeed, if I would revise it. She"
6582,VII,"added that, owing to the connection which I had formed with my"
6583,VII,"publishing house, it would be an easy matter for me to get it"
6584,VII,"published, and she generously offered to divide the royalties with me"
6585,VII,if I would consummate the arrangement!
6586,VII,
6587,VII,"I began to read the manuscript, and had not gone far when I discovered"
6588,VII,"that it was indeed rare. The entire family read it, or portions of it,"
6589,VII,"with screams of laughter, and with tears in their eyes, although it"
6590,VII,"was not intended to be a funny book at all. To this day, certain"
6591,VII,"phrases from that novel will upset any one of us, even at a solemn"
6592,VII,time.
6593,VII,
6594,VII,"Of course it was badly written. Characters appeared, talked for a few"
6595,VII,"pages, and were never seen or heard from again."
6596,VII,
6597,VII,Long conversations were intruded which had no connection with such
6598,VII,"plot as there was. Commonplace descriptions of scenery, also useless,"
6599,VII,were frequent. Many a time the thread of the story was lost. There
6600,VII,were no distinguishing traits in any one of the characters--they all
6601,VII,talked very much alike. But the supreme defect was the author's lack
6602,VII,"of humour. With all seriousness, she made her people say and do"
6603,VII,things which were absolutely ridiculous and not by any means true to
6604,VII,life.
6605,VII,
6606,VII,I think I must have an unsuspected bit of tact somewhere for I
6607,VII,"extricated myself from the situation, and the woman is still my"
6608,VII,"friend. I did not hurt her feelings about her book, nor did I send it"
6609,VII,to my publishers with a letter of recommendation. I remarked that her
6610,VII,"central idea was all right, which was true, since it was a love story,"
6611,VII,but that it had not been properly developed and that she needed to
6612,VII,study. She thanked me for my counsel and said she would rewrite it. I
6613,VII,"wish it might be printed just as it was, however, for it is indeed a"
6614,VII,sodden and mirthless world in which we live and move.
6615,VII,
6616,VII,"As the editors say on the refusal blanks, ""I am always glad to read"
6617,VII,"manuscripts,"" although, as a rule, it makes an enemy for me if I try"
6618,VII,"to help the author by criticism, when only praise was expected or"
6619,VII,desired.
6620,VII,
6621,VII,"Having written some verse which has landed in respectable places, I"
6622,VII,am also asked about poetry. Poems written in trochaic metre with the
6623,VII,"good old rhymes, ""trees and breeze,"" ""light and night,"" soldered on at"
6624,VII,"the end of the lines, are continually brought to me for revision and"
6625,VII,improvement.
6626,VII,
6627,VII,"Once, for the benefit of the literary aspirant, I brought out my"
6628,VII,"rhyming dictionary, but I shall never do it again. He looked it over"
6629,VII,"carefully, while I explained the advantage for the writer in having"
6630,VII,"before him all the available rhymes, so that the least common might"
6631,VII,be quickly chosen and the verse made to run smoothly.
6632,VII,
6633,VII,"""Humph!"" he said; ""it's just the book. Anybody can write poetry with"
6634,VII,"one of these books!"""
6635,VII,
6636,VII,My invaluable thesaurus is chained to my desk in order that it may not
6637,VII,"escape, and I frequently have to justify its existence when aliens"
6638,VII,"penetrate my den. ""It's no wonder you can write,"" was said to me once."
6639,VII,"""Here's all the English language right on your desk, and all you've"
6640,VII,"got to do is to put it together."""
6641,VII,
6642,VII,"""Yes,"" I answered wickedly, ""but it's all in the dictionary too."""
6643,VII,
6644,VII,"Last week I had a rare treat. I met a woman who had ""never seen a"
6645,VII,"literary person before,"" and who said ""it was quite a novelty!"" I"
6646,VII,"beamed upon her, for it is very nice to be a ""novelty,"" and after a"
6647,VII,while we became quite confidential.
6648,VII,
6649,VII,"""I want you to tell me just how you write,"" she said, ""so's I can tell"
6650,VII,"the folks at home. I'm going to buy some of your books to give away."""
6651,VII,
6652,VII,"Mindful of ""royalty to author,"" I immediately became willing to tell"
6653,VII,anything I could.
6654,VII,
6655,VII,"""Well, I want to know how you write. Do you just sit down and do it?"""
6656,VII,
6657,VII,"""Yes, I just sit down and do it."""
6658,VII,
6659,VII,"""Do you write any special time?"""
6660,VII,
6661,VII,"""No, mornings, usually; but any time will do."""
6662,VII,
6663,VII,"""What do you write with--a pen or a pencil?"""
6664,VII,
6665,VII,"""Neither, I always use a typewriter."""
6666,VII,
6667,VII,"""Why, can you write on a typewriter?"""
6668,VII,
6669,VII,"""Yes, it's much easier than a pen, and it keeps the ink off your"
6670,VII,"hands. You can write with both hands at once, you know."""
6671,VII,
6672,VII,"""You have to write it all out with a pencil, first, don't you?"""
6673,VII,
6674,VII,"""No, I just think into the keys."""
6675,VII,
6676,VII,"""Wouldn't it be easier to write it with a pencil first and then copy"
6677,VII,"it?"""
6678,VII,
6679,VII,"""No, or I'd do it that way."""
6680,VII,
6681,VII,"""Do you dress any special way when you write?"""
6682,VII,
6683,VII,"""No, only I must be neat and also comfortable. I usually wear a"
6684,VII,"shirt-waist and take off my collar. Can't write with a collar on, but"
6685,VII,"I must be well groomed otherwise."""
6686,VII,
6687,VII,There was a long silence. The little lady was digesting the
6688,VII,information which she had just received.
6689,VII,
6690,VII,"""It seems easy enough,"" she said. ""I should think any one could write."
6691,VII,"What do you do when it is done?"""
6692,VII,
6693,VII,"""Oh, I go all over it and revise very carefully."""
6694,VII,
6695,VII,"""Why, do you have to go all over it, after it is done?"""
6696,VII,
6697,VII,"""Certainly."""
6698,VII,
6699,VII,"""Then it takes you longer than it does most people, doesn't it?"""
6700,VII,
6701,VII,"""I cannot say as to that. Everybody revises."""
6702,VII,
6703,VII,"""Why, when I write a letter, if I go over it I always scratch out so"
6704,VII,"much that I have to do it over."""
6705,VII,
6706,VII,"""That's the idea, exactly,"" I replied. ""I go over it until there isn't"
6707,VII,"a thing to be scratched out, or a word to be changed."""
6708,VII,
6709,VII,"""But you've got lots left,"" she said, enviously. ""When I go over a"
6710,VII,"letter there's hardly anything left."""
6711,VII,
6712,VII,"Innumerable questions followed these, but at last she had her"
6713,VII,"curiosity partially satisfied and turned away from me. I trust,"
6714,VII,"however, that I shall some day meet her again, for she too is ""a"
6715,VII,"novelty!"""
6716,VII,
6717,VII,The mechanical part of a book is a source of great wonder to the
6718,VII,uninitiated. My galley proofs were once passed around among the guests
6719,VII,at a summer hotel as if they were some new strange animal. They did
6720,VII,"not understand page proofs nor plates, nor how I could ever know when"
6721,VII,it was right.
6722,VII,
6723,VII,The cover is frequently commented upon as a thing of beauty (which
6724,VII,"with my publishers it always is), and I am asked if I did it. I am"
6725,VII,"always sorry that I do not know enough to do covers, so I have to"
6726,VII,explain that an artist does that--that I often do not see it until the
6727,VII,"first copies come from the bindery, and that I am of such small"
6728,VII,importance that I am not often consulted in relation to the
6729,VII,matter--being merely the poor worm who wrote the book.
6730,VII,
6731,VII,There are many people who seem to be afraid to talk before me lest
6732,VII,their pearly utterances be transformed into copy. Time and time again
6733,VII,"I have heard this: ""We must be very careful what we say now, or Miss"
6734,VII,"---- will put us into a book!"""
6735,VII,
6736,VII,People are strangely literal. An author gets no credit whatever for
6737,VII,inventive faculty--his characters and stories are supposedly real
6738,VII,people and real things. I am asked how I came to know so much about
6739,VII,such and such a thing. I once wrote a love story with an unhappy
6740,VII,ending and it was at once assumed that I had been disappointed in
6741,VII,love!
6742,VII,
6743,VII,When my first book came from the press I was pointed out at a
6744,VII,"reception as the author of it. The man surveyed me long and carefully,"
6745,VII,"then he announced: ""That's a mistake. That girl never wrote that book."
6746,VII,"She's too frivolous and empty headed!"""
6747,VII,
6748,VII,"I have tried, until I am discouraged, to make people understand that a"
6749,VII,book does not have to be a verity in order to be true--that a story
6750,VII,"must be possible, instead of actual, and that actual circumstances may"
6751,VII,be too unreal for literature.
6752,VII,
6753,VII,"There are always people who will ask that things, even books, may be"
6754,VII,written especially for them. People often want to tell me a story and
6755,VII,let me write it up into a nice book and divide the royalties with
6756,VII,"them! During a summer at the coast, I had endless opportunities to"
6757,VII,write biographical sketches of the guests at the hotel--to write a
6758,VII,"story and put them all into it, or to write something about anything,"
6759,VII,"that they might have as ""a souvenir!"" As a matter of fact, there were"
6760,VII,only two people at the hotel who could have been of any possible use
6761,VII,"as copy, and one of these was a woman to whom only Mr. Stockton could"
6762,VII,have done justice.
6763,VII,
6764,VII,"It was hard to be always good-natured, but I lost my temper only once."
6765,VII,We stayed late into the autumn and were rewarded by a magnificent
6766,VII,storm. I put on my bathing suit and my mackintosh and went down to the
6767,VII,"beach, in the teeth of a northwest gale. Little needles of sand were"
6768,VII,"blown in my face, and I lost my cap, but it was well worth the effort."
6769,VII,"For over an hour we stood on the desolate beach, sheltered from the"
6770,VII,sand by a bath house. I had never seen anything so grand--it was far
6771,VII,beyond words. At last it grew dark and I was soaked through and stiff
6772,VII,"with the cold. So I went back to the hotel, my soul struck dumb by"
6773,VII,the might and glory of the sea. My heart was too full to speak. The
6774,VII,majestic chords were still thundering in my ears; that tempest-tossed
6775,VII,ocean was still before my eyes. On my way upstairs I met a woman whom
6776,VII,I had formerly liked.
6777,VII,
6778,VII,"""Oh, Miss ----, I want you to write me a description of that storm!"" I"
6779,VII,"brushed past her, rudely, I fear, and she caught hold of the cape of"
6780,VII,"my mackintosh with elephantine playfulness. ""You can't go,"" she said"
6781,VII,"coquettishly, ""until you promise to write me a description of that"
6782,VII,"storm!"""
6783,VII,
6784,VII,"""I can't write it,"" I said coldly. ""Please let me go."""
6785,VII,
6786,VII,"""You've got to write it,"" she returned. ""I know you can, and I won't"
6787,VII,"let you go until you promise me."""
6788,VII,
6789,VII,"I wrenched myself away from her, white with wrath, and got to my room"
6790,VII,"before she did, though she was still pursuing me. I locked my door and"
6791,VII,had a hard fight for my self-control. From the beach came the distant
6792,VII,"boom of the surf, mingled with the liquid melody of the returning"
6793,VII,breakers.
6794,VII,
6795,VII,"Later, just as I had finished dressing for dinner, there was a tap at"
6796,VII,"my door. My friend (?) stood there beaming. ""Have you got it done? You"
6797,VII,"know you promised to write me a description of that storm!"""
6798,VII,
6799,VII,"She remained only three days longer, and I stayed away from her as"
6800,VII,"much as possible, but occasional meetings were inevitable. When the"
6801,VII,"gladsome time of parting came, she hung about my neck."
6802,VII,
6803,VII,"""I want you to come and see me,"" she said. ""You know you haven't done"
6804,VII,what you said you would. Don't you forget to write me a description of
6805,VII,"that storm!"""
6806,VII,
6807,VII,My business arrangements with my publishers are seemingly a matter of
6808,VII,public interest. I am asked how much it costs to print a book the size
6809,VII,of mine. People are surprised to find that I do not pay the expenses
6810,VII,and that I haven't the least idea of what it costs.
6811,VII,
6812,VII,Then they want to know if the publisher buys the book of me. I explain
6813,VII,"that this is sometimes done, but that I myself am paid upon the"
6814,VII,"royalty basis, ---- per cent. on the list price of every copy sold."
6815,VII,"This seems painfully small to the dear public, but it is comparatively"
6816,VII,easy to demonstrate that the royalty on five or six thousand copies is
6817,VII,quite worth while.
6818,VII,
6819,VII,"They shortly come to the conclusion, however, that the publishers make"
6820,VII,"more money than I do, and that seems to them to be very unfair. They"
6821,VII,"suggest that if I published it myself, I should make a great deal more"
6822,VII,money!
6823,VII,
6824,VII,It is difficult for them to understand that writing books and selling
6825,VII,books are two very different propositions--that I don't know enough to
6826,VII,"sell books, and that the imprint of a reputable house upon the"
6827,VII,title-page is worth a great deal to any author.
6828,VII,
6829,VII,"""Well,"" a man once said to me, ""how much did you make out of your book"
6830,VII,"this year?"""
6831,VII,
6832,VII,I explained that the percentage royalty basis was really an equal
6833,VII,"division of the profits, everything considered, and that all the"
6834,VII,"financial risk was on one side. I named my few hundreds, with which I"
6835,VII,was very well satisfied. He absorbed himself in a calculation on the
6836,VII,back of an envelope.
6837,VII,
6838,VII,"""I figure out,"" said he, at length, ""that they must have made at least"
6839,VII,"a third more than you did. That isn't fair!"""
6840,VII,
6841,VII,"My ire arose. ""It is perfectly fair,"" I replied. ""Paper is cheap, I"
6842,VII,"know, but composition isn't, and advertising isn't. They are welcome"
6843,VII,to every penny they can make out of my books. I'd be glad to have them
6844,VII,"make twice as much as they do now, even if my own income remained the"
6845,VII,"same."""
6846,VII,
6847,VII,"At this point, I became telepathically aware that I was considered"
6848,VII,"crazy, so I changed the subject."
6849,VII,
6850,VII,"I am often asked how I happened to meet my publishers and ""get in with"
6851,VII,"them,"" and as a very great favour to me, and to them, I am offered the"
6852,VII,"privilege of sending them some ""splendid novel which was written by a"
6853,VII,"friend"" of somebody--as they know me, ""they have decided to let my"
6854,VII,"publishers have the book!"""
6855,VII,
6856,VII,They are surprised to hear me say that I have never met any member of
6857,VII,"the firm, though I was in the same city with them for over a year."
6858,VII,"More than this, there is nothing on earth, except a green worm, which"
6859,VII,would scare me so much as a summons to that publishing house.
6860,VII,
6861,VII,I have walked by in fear and trembling. I have seen a huge pile of my
6862,VII,"books in the window, and on the bulletin board a poster which bore my"
6863,VII,"name in conspicuous letters, as if I had been cured of something. But"
6864,VII,I should no more dare to go into that office than I should venture to
6865,VII,"call upon the wife of the President with a shawl over my head, and my"
6866,VII,fancywork tucked under my arm.
6867,VII,
6868,VII,This is incomprehensible to the uninitiated. The publishers have ever
6869,VII,been most courteous and kind. They are people with whom it is a
6870,VII,"pleasure to have any sort of business dealings, but we are not bosom"
6871,VII,friends--and I very much fear that they do not care to become chummy
6872,VII,with me.
6873,VII,
6874,VII,There may be some authors who have taken nerve tonics and are not
6875,VII,afraid to meet an editor or publisher. I have even read of some who
6876,VII,will walk cheerfully into an editorial sanctum--but I've never seen a
6877,VII,"sanctum, nor an editor, nor a publisher. I don't even write to an"
6878,VII,editor when I send him a piece--just put in a stamp. He usually knows
6879,VII,what to do with it.
6880,VII,
6881,VII,"Fame, or long experience, may enable authors to meet the arbiters of"
6882,VII,"their destiny without becoming frightened, but I have had brief"
6883,VII,"experience, and still less fame. The admirable qualities of the"
6884,VII,pachyderm may have been bestowed upon some authors--but not on this
6885,VII,one.

6933,VII,
6934,VII,
6935,VII,"Compared with the celebrations of our ancestors, the modern Christmas"
6936,VII,becomes a very hurried thing. The rush of the twentieth century
6937,VII,"forbids twelve days of celebration, or even two. Paterfamilias"
6938,VII,considers himself very indulgent if he gives two nights and a day to
6939,VII,"the annual festival, because, forsooth, ""the office needs him!"""
6940,VII,
6941,VII,One by one the quaint old customs have vanished. We still have the
6942,VII,"Christmas tree, evergreens in our houses and churches, and the yawning"
6943,VII,stocking still waits in many homes for the good St. Nicholas.
6944,VII,
6945,VII,But what is poor Santa Claus to do when the chimney leads to the
6946,VII,"furnace? And what of the city apartment, which boasts a radiator and"
6947,VII,"gas grate, but no chimney? The myth evidently needs reconstruction to"
6948,VII,"meet the times in which we live, and perhaps we shall soon see"
6949,VII,"pictures of Santa Claus arriving in an automobile, and taking the"
6950,VII,"elevator to the ninth floor, flat B, where a single childish stocking"
6951,VII,is hung upon the radiator.
6952,VII,
6953,VII,Nearly all of the Christmas observances began in ancient Rome. The
6954,VII,primitive Italians were wont to celebrate the winter solstice and
6955,VII,call it the feast of Saturn. Thus Saturnalia came to mean almost
6956,VII,"any kind of celebration which came in the wake of conquest, and"
6957,VII,these ceremonies being engrafted upon Anglo-Saxon customs assumed
6958,VII,a religious significance.
6959,VII,
6960,VII,The pretty maid who hesitates and blushes beneath the overhanging
6961,VII,"branch of mistletoe, never stops to think of the grim festival with"
6962,VII,which the Druids celebrated its gathering.
6963,VII,
6964,VII,"In their mythology the plant was regarded with the utmost reverence,"
6965,VII,especially when found growing upon an oak.
6966,VII,
6967,VII,"At the time of the winter solstice, the ancient Britons, accompanied"
6968,VII,"by their priests, the Druids, went out with great pomp and rejoicing"
6969,VII,"to gather the mistletoe, which was believed to possess great curative"
6970,VII,"powers. These processions were usually by night, to the accompaniment"
6971,VII,of flaring torches and the solemn chanting of the people. When an oak
6972,VII,"was reached on which the parasite grew, the company paused."
6973,VII,
6974,VII,"Two white bulls were bound to the tree and the chief Druid, clothed"
6975,VII,"in white to signify purity, climbed, more or less gracefully, to the"
6976,VII,"plant. It was severed from the oak, and another priest, standing"
6977,VII,"below, caught it in the folds of his robe. The bulls were then"
6978,VII,"sacrificed, and often, alas, human victims also. The mistletoe thus"
6979,VII,gathered was divided into small portions and distributed among the
6980,VII,"people. The tiny sprays were fastened above the doors of the houses,"
6981,VII,as propitiation to the sylvan deities during the cold season.
6982,VII,
6983,VII,These rites were retained throughout the Roman occupation of Great
6984,VII,"Britain, and for some time afterward, under the sovereignty of the"
6985,VII,"Jutes, the Saxons, and the Angles."
6986,VII,
6987,VII,In Scandinavian mythology there is a beautiful legend of the
6988,VII,"mistletoe. Balder, the god of poetry, the son of Odin and Friga, one"
6989,VII,day told his mother that he had dreamed his death was near at hand.
6990,VII,"Much alarmed, the mother invoked all the powers of nature--earth, air,"
6991,VII,"water, fire, animals and plants, and obtained from them a solemn oath"
6992,VII,that they would do her son no harm.
6993,VII,
6994,VII,Then Balder fearlessly took his place in the combats of the gods and
6995,VII,fought unharmed while showers of arrows were falling all about him.
6996,VII,
6997,VII,"His enemy, Loake, determined to discover the secret of his"
6998,VII,"invulnerability, and, disguising himself as an old woman, went to the"
6999,VII,mother with a question of the reason of his immunity. Friga answered
7000,VII,that she had made a charm and invoked all nature to keep from injuring
7001,VII,her son.
7002,VII,
7003,VII,"""Indeed,"" said the old woman, ""and did you ask all the animals and"
7004,VII,"plants? There are so many, it seems impossible."""
7005,VII,
7006,VII,"""All but one,"" answered Friga proudly; ""all but a little insignificant"
7007,VII,plant which grows upon the bark of the oak. This I did not think of
7008,VII,"invoking, since so small a thing could do no harm."""
7009,VII,
7010,VII,"Much delighted, Loake went away and gathered mistletoe. Then he"
7011,VII,entered the assembly of the gods and made his way to the blind Heda.
7012,VII,
7013,VII,"""Why do you not shoot with the arrows at Balder?"" asked Loake."
7014,VII,
7015,VII,"""Alas,"" replied Heda, ""I am blind and have no arms."""
7016,VII,
7017,VII,"Loake then gave him an arrow tipped with mistletoe and said: ""Balder"
7018,VII,"is before thee."" Heda shot and Balder fell, pierced through the heart."
7019,VII,
7020,VII,"In its natural state, the plant is believed to be propagated by the"
7021,VII,"missel-thrush, which feeds upon its berries, but under favourable"
7022,VII,climatic conditions one may raise one's own mistletoe by bruising the
7023,VII,"berries on the bark of fruit trees, where they take root readily. It"
7024,VII,"must be remembered, however, that the plant is a true parasite and"
7025,VII,will eventually kill whatever tree gives it nourishment.
7026,VII,
7027,VII,"Kissing under the mistletoe was also a custom of the Druids, and in"
7028,VII,"those uncivilised days men kissed each other. For each kiss, a single"
7029,VII,"white berry was plucked from the spray, and kept as a souvenir by the"
7030,VII,one who was kissed.
7031,VII,
7032,VII,The burning of the Yule log was an ancient Christmas ceremony borrowed
7033,VII,from the early Scandinavians. At their feast of Juul (pronounced
7034,VII,"_Yuul_), at the time of the winter solstice, they were wont to kindle"
7035,VII,huge bonfires in honour of their god Thor. The custom soon made its
7036,VII,way to England where it is still in vogue in many parts of the
7037,VII,country.
7038,VII,
7039,VII,"One may imagine an ancient feudal castle, heavily fortified, standing"
7040,VII,"in splendid isolation upon a snowy hill, on that night of all others"
7041,VII,"when war was forgotten and peace proclaimed. Drawn by six horses, the"
7042,VII,great Yule log was brought into the hall and rolled into the vast
7043,VII,"fireplace, where it was lighted with the charred remnants of last"
7044,VII,"year's Yule log, religiously kept in some secure place as a charm"
7045,VII,against fire.
7046,VII,
7047,VII,As the flames seize upon the oak and the light gleams from the castle
7048,VII,"windows, a lusty procession of wayfarers passes through, each one"
7049,VII,raising his hat as he passes the fire which burns all the evil out of
7050,VII,"the hearts of men, and up to the rafters there rings a stern old Saxon"
7051,VII,chant.
7052,VII,
7053,VII,"When the song was finished, the steaming wassail bowl was brought out,"
7054,VII,and all the company drank to a better understanding.
7055,VII,
7056,VII,"Up to the time of Henry VI, and even afterward, the Yule log was"
7057,VII,greeted with bards and minstrelsy. If a squinting person came into the
7058,VII,"hall while the log was burning, it was sure to bring bad luck. The"
7059,VII,"appearance of a barefooted man was worse, and a flat-footed woman was"
7060,VII,the worst of all.
7061,VII,
7062,VII,"As an accompaniment to the Yule log, a monstrous Christmas candle was"
7063,VII,burned on the table at supper; even now in St. John's College at
7064,VII,"Oxford, there is an old candle socket of stone, ornamented with the"
7065,VII,figure of a lamb. What generations of gay students must have sat
7066,VII,around that kindly light when Christmas came to Oxford!
7067,VII,
7068,VII,Snap-dragon was a favourite Christmas sport at this time. Several
7069,VII,raisins were put into a large shallow bowl and thoroughly saturated
7070,VII,with brandy. All other lights were extinguished and the brandy
7071,VII,ignited. By turns each one of the company tried to snatch a raisin
7072,VII,"out of the flames, singing meanwhile."
7073,VII,
7074,VII,"In Devonshire, they burn great bundles of ash sticks, while master and"
7075,VII,"servants sit together, for once on terms of perfect equality, and"
7076,VII,"drink spiced ale, and the season is one of great rejoicing."
7077,VII,
7078,VII,"Another custom in Devonshire is for the farmer, his family, and"
7079,VII,"friends, to partake of hot cake and cider, and afterward go to the"
7080,VII,"orchard and place a cake ceremoniously in the fork of a big tree, when"
7081,VII,cider is poured over it while the men fire off pistols and the women
7082,VII,sing.
7083,VII,
7084,VII,"A similar libation, but of spiced ale, used to be sprinkled through"
7085,VII,the orchards and meadows of Norfolk. Midnight of Christmas was the
7086,VII,time usually chosen for the ceremony.
7087,VII,
7088,VII,"In Devon and Cornwall, a belief is current that, at midnight on"
7089,VII,"Christmas Eve, the cattle kneel in their stalls in honour of the"
7090,VII,"Saviour, as legend claims they did in Bethlehem."
7091,VII,
7092,VII,"In Wales, they carry about at Christmas time a horse's skull gaily"
7093,VII,"adorned with ribbons, and supported on a pole by a man who is wholly"
7094,VII,concealed by a white cloth. There is a clever contrivance for opening
7095,VII,"and shutting the jaws, and this strange creature pursues and bites all"
7096,VII,who come near it.
7097,VII,
7098,VII,The figure is usually accompanied by a party of men and boys
7099,VII,"grotesquely dressed, who, on reaching a house, sing some verses, often"
7100,VII,"extemporaneous, demanding admittance, and are answered in the same"
7101,VII,fashion by those within until rhymes have given out on one side or
7102,VII,the other.
7103,VII,
7104,VII,"In Scotland, he who first opens the door on Christmas Day expects more"
7105,VII,good luck than will fall to the lot of other members of the family
7106,VII,"during the year, because, as the saying goes, he lets in Yule."
7107,VII,
7108,VII,"In Germany, Christmas Eve is the children's night, and there is a tree"
7109,VII,and presents. England and America appear to have borrowed the
7110,VII,"Christmas tree from Germany, where the custom is ancient and very"
7111,VII,generally followed.
7112,VII,
7113,VII,"In the smaller towns and villages in northern Germany, the presents"
7114,VII,"are sent by all the parents to some one fellow who, in high buskins,"
7115,VII,"white robe, mask, and flaxen wig, personates the servant, Rupert. On"
7116,VII,"Christmas night he goes around to every house, and says that his"
7117,VII,master sent him. The parents and older children receive him with pomp
7118,VII,"and reverence, while the younger ones are often badly frightened."
7119,VII,
7120,VII,"He asks for the children, and then demands of their parents a report"
7121,VII,of their conduct during the past year. The good children are rewarded
7122,VII,"with sugar-plums and other things, while for the bad ones a rod is"
7123,VII,given to the parents with instructions to use it freely during the
7124,VII,coming year.
7125,VII,
7126,VII,"In those parts of Pennsylvania where there are many German settlers,"
7127,VII,the little sinners often find birchen rods suggestively placed in
7128,VII,their stockings on Christmas morning.
7129,VII,
7130,VII,"In Poland, the Christmas gifts are hidden, and the members of the"
7131,VII,family search for them.
7132,VII,
7133,VII,"In Sweden and Norway, the house is thoroughly cleaned, and juniper or"
7134,VII,fir branches are spread over the floor. Then each member of the family
7135,VII,"goes in turn to the bake house, or outer shed, where he takes his"
7136,VII,annual bath.
7137,VII,
7138,VII,"But it is back to Old England, after all, that we look for the"
7139,VII,"merriest Christmas. For two or three weeks beforehand, men and boys"
7140,VII,"of the poorer class, who were called ""waits,"" sang Christmas carols"
7141,VII,under every window. Until quite recently these carols were sung all
7142,VII,"through England, and others of similar import were heard in France and"
7143,VII,Italy.
7144,VII,
7145,VII,"The English are said to ""take their pleasures sadly,"" but in the"
7146,VII,"matter of Christmas they can ""give us cards and spades and still win."""
7147,VII,Parties of Christmas drummers used to go around to the different
7148,VII,"houses, grotesquely attired, and play all sorts of tricks. The actors"
7149,VII,"were chiefly boys, and the parish beadle always went along to insure"
7150,VII,order.
7151,VII,
7152,VII,The Christmas dinner of Old England was a thing capable of giving the
7153,VII,whole nation dyspepsia if they indulged freely.
7154,VII,
7155,VII,"The main dish was a boar's head, roasted to a turn, and preceded by"
7156,VII,trumpets and minstrelsy. Mustard was indispensable to this dish.
7157,VII,
7158,VII,"Next came a peacock, skinned and roasted. The beak was gilded, and"
7159,VII,"sometimes a bit of cotton, well soaked in spirits, was put into his"
7160,VII,"mouth, and when he was brought to the table this was ignited, so that"
7161,VII,"the bird was literally spouting fire. He was stuffed with spices,"
7162,VII,"basted with yolks of eggs, and served with plenty of gravy."
7163,VII,
7164,VII,"Geese, capons, pheasants, carps' tongues, frumenty, and mince, or"
7165,VII,"""shred"" pies, made up the balance of the feast."
7166,VII,
7167,VII,"The chief functionary of Christmas was called ""The Lord of Misrule."""
7168,VII,
7169,VII,In the house of king and nobleman he held full sway for twelve days.
7170,VII,"His badge was a fool's bauble and he was always attended by a page,"
7171,VII,"both of them being masked. So many pranks were played, and so much"
7172,VII,"mischief perpetrated which was far from being amusing, that an edict"
7173,VII,"was eventually issued against this form of liberty, not to say"
7174,VII,license.
7175,VII,
7176,VII,"The Lord of Misrule was especially reviled by the Puritans, one of"
7177,VII,"whom set him down as ""a grande captain of mischiefe."" One may easily"
7178,VII,imagine that this stern old gentleman had been ducked by a party of
7179,VII,"revellers following in the wake of the lawless ""Captaine"" because he"
7180,VII,had refused to contribute to their entertainment.
7181,VII,
7182,VII,"We need not lament the passing of Christmas pageantry, if the spirit"
7183,VII,of the festival remains. Through the centuries that have passed since
7184,VII,"the first Christmas, the spirit of it has wandered in and out like a"
7185,VII,"golden thread in a dull tapestry, sometimes hidden, but never wholly"
7186,VII,lost. It behooves us to keep well and reverently such Christmas as we
7187,VII,"have, else we shall share old Ben Jonson's lament in _The Mask of"
7188,VII,"Father Christmas_, which was presented before the English Court nearly"
7189,VII,two hundred years ago:
7190,VII,
7191,VII,"""Any man or woman ... that can give any knowledge, or tell"
7192,VII,"any tidings of an old, very old, grey haired gentleman"
7193,VII,"called Christmas, who was wont to be a very familiar ghest,"
7194,VII,"and visit all sorts of people both pore and rich, and used"
7195,VII,"to appear in glittering gold, silk and silver in the court,"
7196,VII,"and in all shapes in the theatre in Whitehall, and had"
7197,VII,"singing, feasts and jolitie in all places, both citie and"
7198,VII,countrie for his coming--whosoever can tel what is become of
7199,VII,"him, or where he may be found, let them bring him back again"
7200,VII,"into England."""
