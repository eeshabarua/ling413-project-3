33,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON
34,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
35,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,I cannot say how deeply it touched me to learn that Pauline Johnson
36,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"expressed a wish on her death-bed that I, living here in the mother"
37,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"country all these miles away, should write something about her."
38,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"I was not altogether surprised, however, for her letters to me"
39,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,had long ago shed a golden light upon her peculiar character. She
40,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"had made herself believe, quite erroneously, that she was largely"
41,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,indebted to me for her success in the literary world. The letters I
42,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,had from her glowed with this noble passion: the delusion about her
43,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"indebtedness to me, in spite of all I could say, never left her. She"
44,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,continued to foster and cherish this delusion. Gratitude indeed was
45,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"with her not a sentiment merely, as with most of us, but a veritable"
46,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,passion. And when we consider how rare a human trait true gratitude
47,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,is--the one particular characteristic in which the lower animals
48,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,put us to shame--it can easily be imagined how I was touched to find
49,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,that this beautiful and grand Canadian girl remained down to the
50,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,very last moment of her life the impersonation of that most precious
51,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"of all virtues. I have seen much of my fellow men and women, and"
52,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,I never knew but two other people who displayed gratitude as a
53,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"passion--indulged in it, I might say, as a luxury--and they were"
54,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"both poets. I can give no higher praise to the ""irritable genus."""
55,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,On this account Pauline Johnson will always figure in my memory as
56,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,one of the noblest minded of the human race.
57,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
58,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,Circumstances made my personal knowledge of her all too slight. Our
59,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"spiritual intimacy, however, was very strong, and I hope I shall be"
60,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,pardoned for saying a few words as to how our friendship began. It
61,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"was at the time of Vancouver's infancy, when the population of the"
62,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,beautiful town of her final adoption was less than a twelfth of what
63,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"it now is, and less than a fiftieth part of what it is soon going"
64,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,to be.
65,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
66,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,In 1906 I met her during one of her tours. How well I remember it!
67,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,She was visiting London in company with Mr. McRaye--making a tour of
68,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,England--reciting Canadian poetry. And on this occasion Mr. McRaye
69,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,added to the interest of the entertainment by rendering in a
70,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,perfectly marvellous way Dr. Drummond's Habitant poems. It was in
71,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"the Steinway Hall, and the audience was enthusiastic. When, after"
72,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"the performance, my wife and I went into the room behind the"
73,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"stage to congratulate her, I was quite affected by the warm and"
74,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,affectionate greeting that I got from her. With moist eyes she
75,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,told her friends that she owed her literary success mainly to me.
76,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
77,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,And now what does the reader suppose that I had done to win all
78,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,these signs of gratitude? I had simply alluded--briefly alluded--in
79,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"the London ""Athenaeum"" some years before, to her genius and her"
80,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,work. Never surely was a reviewer so royally overpaid. Her allusion
81,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,was to a certain article of mine on Canadian poetry which was
82,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"written in 1889, and which she had read so assiduously that she"
83,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,might be said to know it by heart: she seemed to remember every
84,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,word of it.
85,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
86,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,Now that I shall never see her face again it is with real emotion
87,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,that I recur to this article and to the occasion of it. Many years
88,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,ago--nearly a quarter of a century--a beloved friend whom I still
89,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"mourn, Norman Maccoll, editor of the ""Athenaeum,"" sent me a book"
90,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"called ""Songs of the Great Dominion,"" selected and edited by the"
91,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"poet, William Douw Lighthall. Maccoll knew the deep interest I"
92,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"have always taken in matters relating to Greater Britain, and"
93,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,especially in everything relating to Canada. Even at that time
94,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,I ventured to prophesy that the great romance of the twentieth
95,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"century would be the growth of the mighty world-power of Canada,"
96,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,just as the great romance of the nineteenth century had been the
97,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,inauguration of the nascent power that sprang up among Britain's
98,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,antipodes. He told me that a leading article for the journal upon
99,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"some weighty subject was wanted, and asked me whether the book was"
100,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,important enough to be worth a leader. I turned over its pages and
101,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,soon satisfied myself as to that point. I found the book rich in
102,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,poetry--true poetry--by poets some of whom have since then come to
103,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"great and world-wide distinction, all of it breathing, more or less,"
104,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,the atmosphere of Canada: that is to say Anglo-Saxon Canada. But
105,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,in the writings of one poet alone I came upon a new note--the note
106,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,of the Red Man's Canada. This was the poet that most interested
107,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"me--Pauline Johnson. I quoted her lovely canoe song ""In the Shadows,"""
108,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,which will be found in this volume. I at once sat down and wrote
109,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"a long article, which could have been ten times as long, upon a"
110,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,subject so suggestive as that of Canadian poetry.
111,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
112,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"As it was this article of mine which drew this noble woman to me,"
113,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"it has, since her death, assumed an importance in my eyes which it"
114,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,intrinsically does not merit. I might almost say that it has become
115,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,sacred to me among my fugitive writings: this is why I cannot resist
116,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,the temptation of making a few extracts from it. It seems to bring
117,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"the dead poet very close to me. Moreover, it gives me an opportunity"
118,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,of re-saying what I then said of the great place Canadian poetry is
119,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,destined to hold in the literature of the English-speaking race. I
120,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"had often before said in the ""Athenaeum,"" and in the ""Encyclopaedia"
121,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"Britannica"" and elsewhere, that all true poetry--perhaps all true"
122,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,literature--must be a faithful reflex either of the life of man or
123,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,of the life of Nature.
124,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
125,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"Well, this article began by remarking that the subject of Colonial"
126,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"verse, and the immense future before the English-speaking poets,"
127,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"is allied to a question that is very great, the adequacy or"
128,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"inadequacy of English poetry--British, American, and Colonial--to"
129,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,the destiny of the race that produces it. The article enunciated
130,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,the thesis that if the English language should not in the near
131,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"future contain the finest body of poetry in the world, the time"
132,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,is now upon us when it ought to do so; for no other literature has
133,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,had that variety of poetic material which is now at the command of
134,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,English-speaking poets. It pointed out that at the present moment
135,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,this material comprises much of the riches peculiar to the Old World
136,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,and all the riches peculiar to the New. It pointed out that in
137,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,reflecting the life of man the English muse enters into competition
138,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"with the muse of every other European nation, classic and modern;"
139,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"and that, rich as England undoubtedly is in her own historic"
140,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"associations, she is not so rich as are certain other European"
141,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"countries, where almost every square yard of soil is so suggestive"
142,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,of human associations that it might be made the subject of a
143,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"poem. To wander alone, through scenes that Homer knew, or through"
144,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"the streets that were hallowed by the footsteps of Dante, is an"
145,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,experience that sends a poetic thrill through the blood. For it is
146,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,on classic ground only that the Spirit of Antiquity walks. And it
147,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"went on to ask the question, ""If even England, with all her riches"
148,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"of historic and legendary associations, is not so rich in this"
149,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"kind of poetic material as some parts of the European Continent,"
150,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"what shall be said of the new English worlds--Canada, the United"
151,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"States, the Australias, the South African Settlements, etc.?"""
152,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"Histories they have, these new countries--in the development of"
153,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"the human race, in the growth of the great man, Mankind--histories"
154,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"as important, no doubt, as those of Greece, Italy, and Great"
155,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"Britain. Inasmuch, however, as the sweet Spirit of Antiquity knows"
156,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"them not, where is the poet with wings so strong that he can carry"
157,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"them off into the ""ampler ether,"" the ""diviner air"" where history"
158,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,itself is poetry?
159,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
160,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"Let me repeat here, at the risk of seeming garrulous, a few sentences"
161,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"in that article which especially appealed to Pauline Johnson, as she"
162,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,told me:
163,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
164,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"""Part and parcel of the very life of man is the sentiment about"
165,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"antiquity. Irrational it may be, if you will, but never will it be"
166,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,stifled. Physical science strengthens rather than weakens it. Social
167,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"science, hate it as it may, cannot touch it. In the socialist,"
168,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"William Morris, it is stronger than in the most conservative poet"
169,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,that has ever lived. Those who express wonderment that in these days
170,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,there should be the old human playthings as bright and captivating
171,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,as ever--those who express wonderment at the survival of all the
172,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,delightful features of the European raree-show--have not realised
173,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"the power of the Spirit of Antiquity, and the power of the sentiment"
174,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,about him--that sentiment which gives birth to the great human
175,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,dream about hereditary merit and demerit upon which society--royalist
176,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,or republican--is built. What is the use of telling us that even in
177,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,Grecian annals there is no kind of heroism recorded which you cannot
178,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,match in the histories of the United States and Canada? What is the
179,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,use of telling us that the travels of Ulysses and of Jason are as
180,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,nothing in point of real romance compared with Captain Phillip's
181,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"voyage to the other side of the world, when he led his little"
182,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,convict-laden fleet to Botany Bay--a bay as unknown almost as any
183,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,bay in Laputa--that voyage which resulted in the founding of a
184,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,cluster of great nations any one of whose mammoth millionaires could
185,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,now buy up Ilium and the Golden Fleece combined if offered in the
186,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,auction mart? The Spirit of Antiquity knows not that captain. In
187,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"a thousand years' time, no doubt, these things may be as ripe for"
188,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,poetic treatment as the voyage of the Argonauts; but on a planet
189,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,like this a good many changes may occur before an epic poet shall
190,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"arise to sing them. Mr. Lighthall would remind us, did we in England"
191,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"need reminding, that Canada owes her very existence at this moment"
192,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,to a splendid act of patriotism--the withdrawal out of the rebel
193,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,colonies of the British loyalists after the war of the revolution.
194,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"It is 'the noblest epic migration the world has ever seen,' says"
195,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"Mr. Lighthall, 'more loftily epic than the retirement of Pius"
196,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"AEneas from Ilion.' Perhaps so, but at present the dreamy spirit"
197,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,of Antiquity knows not one word of the story. In a thousand years'
198,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"time he will have heard of it, possibly, and then he will carefully"
199,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"consider those two 'retirements' as subjects for epic poetry."""
200,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
201,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,The article went on to remark that until the Spirit of Antiquity
202,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"hears of this latter retirement and takes it into his consideration,"
203,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"it must, as poetic material, give way to another struggle which he"
204,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,persists in considering to be greater still--the investment by a
205,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,handful of Achaians of a little town held by a handful of Trojans.
206,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,It is the power of this Spirit of Antiquity that tells against
207,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"English poetry as a reflex of the life of man. In Europe, in which,"
208,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"as Pericles said, ""The whole earth is the tomb of illustrious men,"""
209,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,the Spirit of Antiquity is omnipotent.
210,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
211,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"The article then discussed the main subject of the argument, saying"
212,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,how very different it is when we come to consider poetic art as the
213,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"reflex of the life of Nature. Here the muse of Canada ought to be,"
214,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"and is, so great and strong. It is not in the old countries, it is"
215,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"in the new, that the poet can adequately reflect the life of Nature."
216,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"It is in them alone that he can confront Nature's face as it is,"
217,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,uncoloured by associations of history and tradition. What Wordsworth
218,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"tried all his life to do, the poets of Canada, of the Australias,"
219,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"of the Cape, have the opportunity of doing. How many a home-bounded"
220,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,Englishman must yearn for the opportunity now offered by the
221,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,Canadian Pacific Railway of seeing the great virgin forests and
222,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,prairies before settlement has made much progress--of seeing them as
223,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,they existed before even the foot of the Red Man trod them--of seeing
224,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,them without that physical toil which only a few hardy explorers can
225,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,undergo. It is hard to realise that he who has not seen the vast
226,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,unsettled tracts of the British Empire knows Nature only under the
227,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,same aspect as she has been known by all the poets from Homer to our
228,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,own day. And when I made the allusion to Pauline Johnson's poems
229,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"which brought me such reward, I quoted ""In the Shadows."" The poem"
230,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,fascinated me--it fairly haunted me. I could not get it out of my
231,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,head; and I remember that I was rather severe on Mr. Lighthall for
232,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,only giving us two examples of a poet so rare--so full of the spirit
233,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,of the open air.
234,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
235,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,Naturally I turned to his introductory remarks to see who Pauline
236,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,Johnson was. I was not at all surprised to find that she had Indian
237,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"blood in her veins, but I was surprised and delighted to find that"
238,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,she belonged to a famous Indian family--the Mohawks of Brantford.
239,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,The Mohawks of Brantford! that splendid race to whose unswerving
240,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"loyalty during two centuries not only Canada, but the entire"
241,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,British Empire owes a debt that can never be repaid.
242,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
243,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,After the appearance of my article I got a beautiful letter from
244,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"Pauline Johnson, and I found that I had been fortunate enough to"
245,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,enrich my life with a new friendship.
246,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
247,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,And now as to the genius of Pauline Johnson: it was being recognised
248,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"not only in Canada, but all over the great Continent of the"
249,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,West. Since 1889 I have been following her career with a glow of
250,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,admiration and sympathy. I have been delighted to find that this
251,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,success of hers had no damaging effect upon the grand simplicity of
252,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,her nature. Up to the day of her death her passionate sympathy with
253,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"the aborigines of Canada never flagged, as shown by such poems as"
254,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"""The Cattle Thief"", ""The Pilot of the Plains"", ""As Red Men Die"","
255,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"and many another. During all this time, however, she was cultivating"
256,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"herself in a thousand ways--taking interest in the fine arts, as"
257,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"witness her poem ""The Art of Alma-Tadema"". Her native power of"
258,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"satire is shown in the lines written after Dreyfus was exiled,"
259,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"called ""'Give us Barabbas'"". She had also a pretty gift of vers de"
260,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"societe, as seen in her lines ""Your Mirror Frame""."
261,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
262,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,Her death is not only a great loss to those who knew and loved her:
263,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,it is a great loss to Canadian literature and to the Canadian
264,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,nation. I must think that she will hold a memorable place among
265,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,poets in virtue of her descent and also in virtue of the work she
266,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"has left behind, small as the quantity of that work is. I believe"
267,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"that Canada will, in future times, cherish her memory more and more,"
268,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,for of all Canadian poets she was the most distinctly a daughter of
269,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"the soil, inasmuch as she inherited the blood of the great primeval"
270,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"race now so rapidly vanishing, and of the greater race that has"
271,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,supplanted it.
272,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,
273,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"In reading the description of the funeral in the ""News-Advertiser,"""
274,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,I was specially touched by the picture of the large crowd of silent
275,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"Red Men who lined Georgia Street, and who stood as motionless as"
276,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,"statues all through the service, and until the funeral cortege had"
277,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,passed on the way to the cemetery. This must have rendered the
278,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,funeral the most impressive and picturesque one of any poet that
279,IN MEMORIAM: PAULINE JOHNSON,has ever lived.

326,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and Colonial Revolutionists; and for which fealty they were granted
327,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the magnificent lands bordering the Grand River in the County of
328,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Brant, Ontario, and on which the tribes still live."
329,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
330,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"It was upon this Reserve, on her father's estate, ""Chiefswood,"""
331,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,that Pauline Johnson was born. And it is inevitable that the loyalty
332,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,to Britain and Britain's flag which she inherited from her Red
333,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"ancestors, as well as from her English mother, breathes through both"
334,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,her prose and poetic writings.
335,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
336,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,At an extremely early age this little Indian girl evinced an intense
337,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"love of poetry; and even before she could write, composed many"
338,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,little childish jingles about her pet dogs and cats. She was also
339,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"very fond of learning by heart anything that took her fancy, and"
340,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"would memorize, apparently without effort, verses that were read to"
341,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"her. A telling instance of this early love of poetry may be cited,"
342,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"when on one occasion, while she was yet a tiny child of four, a"
343,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"friend of her father's, who was going to a distant city, asked her"
344,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"what he could bring her as a present, and she replied, ""Verses,"
345,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"please."""
346,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
347,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"At twelve years of age she was writing fairly creditable poems, but"
348,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"was afraid to offer them for publication, lest in after years she"
349,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,might regret their almost inevitable crudity. So she did not publish
350,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,anything until after her school days were ended.
351,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
352,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Her education was neither extensive nor elaborate, and embraced"
353,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,neither High School nor College. A nursery governess for two years
354,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"at home, three years at an Indian day school half a mile from her"
355,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"home, and two years in the central school of the City of Brantford"
356,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,was the extent of her educational training. But besides this she
357,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"acquired a wide general knowledge, having been, through childhood"
358,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"and early girlhood, a great reader, especially of poetry. Before"
359,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"she was twelve years old she had read every line of Scott's poems,"
360,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"every line of Longfellow, much of Byron, Shakespeare, and such books"
361,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"as Addison's ""Spectator,"" Foster's Essays and Owen Meredith."
362,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
363,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,The first periodicals to accept her poems and place them before
364,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"the public were ""Gems of Poetry,"" a small magazine published in"
365,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"New York, and ""The Week,"" established by the late Professor Goldwin"
366,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Smith, of Toronto, the ""New York Independent,"" and ""Toronto Saturday"
367,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Night."" Since then she has contributed to ""The Athenaeum,"" ""The"
368,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Academy,"" ""Black and White,"" ""The Pall Mall Gazette,"" ""The Daily"
369,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Express,"" and ""Canada,"" all of London, England; ""The Review of"

376,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
377,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1892 the opportunity of a lifetime came to this young versifier,"
378,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"when Frank Yeigh, the president of the Young Liberals' Club, of"
379,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Toronto, conceived the idea of having an evening of Canadian"
380,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"literature, at which all available Canadian authors should be"
381,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,guests and read from their own works.
382,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
383,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Among the authors present on this occasion was Pauline Johnson, who"
384,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"contributed to the programme one of her compositions, entitled ""A"
385,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Cry from an Indian Wife""; and when she recited without text this"
386,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"much-discussed poem, which shows the Indian's side of the North-West"
387,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Rebellion, she was greeted with tremendous applause from an audience"
388,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"which represented the best of Toronto's art, literature and culture."
389,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"She was the only one on the programme who received an encore, and to"
390,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,this she replied with one of her favourite canoeing poems.
391,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
392,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,The following morning the entire press of Toronto asked why this
393,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,young writer was not on the platform as a professional reader;
394,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"while two of the dailies even contained editorials on the subject,"
395,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"inquiring why she had never published a volume of her poems, and"
396,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"insisted so strongly that the public should hear more of her,"
397,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,that Mr. Frank Yeigh arranged for her to give an entire evening
398,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,in Association Hall within two weeks from the date of her first
399,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,appearance. It was for this first recital that she wrote the poem
400,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"by which she is best known, ""The Song my Paddle Sings."""
401,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
402,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"On this eventful occasion, owing to the natural nervousness which"
403,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"besets a beginner, and to the fact that she had scarcely had time"
404,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"to memorize her new poem, she became confused in this particular"
405,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"member, and forgot her lines. With true Indian impassiveness,"
406,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"however, she never lost her self-control, but smilingly passed over"
407,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the difficulty by substituting something else; and completely won
408,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the hearts of her audience by her coolness and self-possession. The
409,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"one thought uppermost in her mind, she afterwards said, was that she"
410,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,should not leave the platform and thereby acknowledge her defeat;
411,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and it is undoubtedly this same determination to succeed which has
412,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,carried her successfully through the many years she has been before
413,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the public.
414,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
415,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,The immediate success of this entertainment caused Mr. Yeigh to
416,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,undertake the management of a series of recitals for her throughout
417,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Canada, with the object of enabling her to go to England to submit"
418,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,her poems to a London publisher. Within two years this end was
419,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"accomplished, and she spent the season of 1894 in London, and had"
420,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"her book of poems, ""The White Wampum,"" accepted by John Lane, of the"
421,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"""Bodley Head."" She carried with her letters of introduction from His"
422,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Excellency the Earl of Aberdeen and Rev. Professor Clark, of Toronto"
423,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"University, which gave her a social and literary standing in London"
424,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,which left nothing to be desired.
425,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
426,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In London she met many authors, artists and critics, who gave this"
427,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,young Canadian girl the right hand of fellowship; and she was
428,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,received and asked to give recitals in the drawing-rooms of many
429,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"diplomats, critics and members of the nobility."
430,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
431,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Her book, ""The White Wampum,"" was enthusiastically received by the"
432,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,critics and press; and was highly praised by such papers as the
433,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Edinburgh ""Scotsman,"" ""Glasgow Herald,"" ""Manchester Guardian,"""
434,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"""Bristol Mercury,"" ""Yorkshire Post,"" ""The Whitehall Review,"" ""Pall"
435,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Mall Gazette,"" the London ""Athenaeum,"" the London ""Academy,"" ""Black"
436,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"and White,"" ""Westminster Review,"" etc."
437,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
438,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Upon her return to Canada she made her first trip to the Pacific
439,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Coast, giving recitals at all the cities and towns en route. Since"
440,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"then she has crossed the Rocky Mountains nineteen times, and"
441,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,appeared as a public entertainer at every city and town between
442,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Halifax and Vancouver.
443,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
444,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1903 the George Morang Publishing Company, of Toronto, brought"
445,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"out her second book of poems, entitled ""Canadian Born,"" which was so"
446,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,well received that the entire edition was exhausted within the year.
447,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
448,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"About this time she visited Newfoundland, taking with her letters"
449,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"of introduction from Sir Charles Tupper to Sir Robert Bond, the"
450,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,then Prime Minister of the colony. Her recital in St. John was the
451,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"literary event of the season, and was given under the personal"
452,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"patronage of His Excellency the Governor-General and Lady McCallum,"
453,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and the Admiral of the British Flagship.
454,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
455,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,After this recital in the capital Miss Johnson went to all the small
456,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"seaports and to Hearts' Content, the great Atlantic Cable station,"
457,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,her mission being more to secure material for magazine articles on
458,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the staunch Newfoundlanders and their fishing villages than for the
459,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,purpose of giving recitals.
460,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
461,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1906 she returned to England, and made her first appearance in"
462,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Steinway Hall, under the distinguished patronage of Lord and Lady"
463,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Strathcona, to whom she carried letters of introduction from the"
464,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Right Honourable Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada. On"
465,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"this occasion she was accompanied by Mr. Walter McRaye, who added"
466,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,greatly to the Canadian interest of the programme by his inimitable
467,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,renditions of Dr. Drummond's Habitant poems.
468,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
469,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"The following year she again visited London, returning by way of the"
470,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"United States, where she and Mr. McRaye were engaged by the American"
471,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Chautauquas for a series of recitals covering eight weeks, during"
472,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"which time they went as far as Boulder, Colorado. Then, after one"
473,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"more tour of Canada, she decided to give up public work, settle down"
474,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"in the city of her choice, Vancouver, British Columbia, and devote"
475,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,herself to literature only.
476,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
477,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Only a woman of tremendous powers of endurance could have borne up
478,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,under the hardships necessarily encountered in travelling through
479,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,North-Western Canada in pioneer days as Miss Johnson did; and
480,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,shortly after settling down in Vancouver the exposure and hardship
481,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"she had endured began to tell upon her, and her health completely"
482,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,broke down. For more than a year she has been an invalid; and as she
483,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"was not able to attend to the business herself, a trust was formed"
484,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,by some of the leading citizens of her adopted city for the purpose
485,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"of collecting, and publishing for her benefit, her later works."
486,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Among these is a number of beautiful Indian legends which she has
487,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,been at great pains to collect; and a splendid series of boys'
488,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"stories, which were exceedingly well received when they ran recently"
489,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,in an American boys' magazine.
490,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
491,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,During the sixteen years Miss Johnson was travelling she had many
492,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,varied and interesting experiences. She has driven up the old
493,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Battleford trail before the railroad went through, and across the"
494,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Boundary country in British Columbia in the romantic days of the
495,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,early pioneers; and once she took an 850-mile drive up the Cariboo
496,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"trail to the gold-fields. She was always an ardent canoeist, ran"
497,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"many strange rivers, crossed many a lonely lake, and camped in many"
498,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,an unfrequented place. These venturous trips she took more from her
499,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,inherent love of nature and of adventure than from any necessity
500,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,of her profession.
501,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
502,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,After an illness of two years' duration Miss Johnson died in
503,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Vancouver on March 7, 1913. The heroic spirit in which she endured"
504,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"long months of suffering is expressed in her poem entitled ""And He"
505,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Said 'Fight On'"" which she wrote after she was informed by her"
506,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,physician that her illness would prove fatal.
507,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
508,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Time and its ally, Dark Disarmament"
509,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Have compassed me about;
510,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Have massed their armies, and on battle bent"
511,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"My forces put to rout,"
512,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"But though I fight alone, and fall, and die,"
513,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Talk terms of Peace? Not I.
514,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
515,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,It is eminently fitting that this daughter of Nature should have
516,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,been laid to rest in no urban cemetery. According to her own request
517,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"she was buried in Stanley Park, Vancouver's beautiful heritage of"
518,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the forest primeval. A simple stone surrounded by rustic palings
519,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"marks her grave and on this stone is carved the one word ""Pauline."""
520,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,There she lies among ferns and wild flowers a short distance from
521,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Siwash Rock, the story of which she has recorded in the legends of"
522,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,her race. In time to come a pathway to her grave will be worn by
523,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,lovers of Canadian poetry who will regard it as one of the most
524,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,romantic of our literary shrines.

560,OJISTOH,In day and meet his deadly tomahawk;

574,OJISTOH,The one I hated most: his eye he swept
575,OJISTOH,"Over my misery, and sneering said,"
576,OJISTOH,"""Thus, fair Ojistoh, we avenge our dead."""
577,OJISTOH,
578,OJISTOH,"And we two rode, rode as a sea wind-chased,"
579,OJISTOH,"I, bound with buckskin to his hated waist,"
580,OJISTOH,"He, sneering, laughing, jeering, while he lashed"
581,OJISTOH,"The horse to foam, as on and on we dashed."
582,OJISTOH,"Plunging through creek and river, bush and trail,"
583,OJISTOH,"On, on we galloped like a northern gale."
584,OJISTOH,"At last, his distant Huron fires aflame"
585,OJISTOH,"We saw, and nearer, nearer still we came."
586,OJISTOH,
587,OJISTOH,"I, bound behind him in the captive's place,"
588,OJISTOH,Scarcely could see the outline of his face.
589,OJISTOH,"I smiled, and laid my cheek against his back:"
590,OJISTOH,"""Loose thou my hands,"" I said. ""This pace let slack."
591,OJISTOH,Forget we now that thou and I are foes.
592,OJISTOH,"I like thee well, and wish to clasp thee close;"
593,OJISTOH,I like the courage of thine eye and brow;
594,OJISTOH,"I like thee better than my Mohawk now."""
595,OJISTOH,
596,OJISTOH,He cut the cords; we ceased our maddened haste
597,OJISTOH,I wound my arms about his tawny waist;
598,OJISTOH,My hand crept up the buckskin of his belt;
599,OJISTOH,His knife hilt in my burning palm I felt;
600,OJISTOH,"One hand caressed his cheek, the other drew"
601,OJISTOH,"The weapon softly--""I love you, love you,"""

605,OJISTOH,"Ha! how I rode, rode as a sea wind-chased,"
606,OJISTOH,"Mad with sudden freedom, mad with haste,"
607,OJISTOH,Back to my Mohawk and my home. I lashed
608,OJISTOH,"That horse to foam, as on and on I dashed."
609,OJISTOH,"Plunging thro' creek and river, bush and trail,"
610,OJISTOH,"On, on I galloped like a northern gale."

1100,WOLVERINE,
1101,WOLVERINE,"""An' then--a voice, an Indyan voice, that called out clear and clean,"
1102,WOLVERINE,"'Take Indyan's horse, I run like deer, wolf can't catch Wolverine.'"

1110,WOLVERINE,"You won't believe it, sir, but what I'm tellin' you is true,"
1111,WOLVERINE,But that there chap was 'round next day as sound as me or you.
1112,WOLVERINE,
1113,WOLVERINE,"""He came to get his horse, but not a cent he'd take from me."
1114,WOLVERINE,"Yes, sir, you're right, the Indyans now ain't like they used to be;"
1115,WOLVERINE,We've got 'em sharpened up a bit an' _now_ they'll take a fee.
1116,WOLVERINE,
1117,WOLVERINE,"""No, sir, you're wrong, they ain't no 'dogs.' I'm not through tellin' yet;"
1118,WOLVERINE,"You'll take that name right back again, or else jest out you get!"
1119,WOLVERINE,"You'll take that name right back when you hear all this yarn, I bet."
1120,WOLVERINE,
1121,WOLVERINE,"""It happened that same autumn, when some Whites was comin' in,"
1122,WOLVERINE,"I heard the old Red River carts a-kickin' up a din,"
1123,WOLVERINE,So I went over to their camp to see an English skin.
1124,WOLVERINE,
1125,WOLVERINE,"""They said, 'They'd had an awful scare from Injuns,' an' they swore"

1127,WOLVERINE,A-brandishing their tomahawks an' painted up for war.
1128,WOLVERINE,
1129,WOLVERINE,"""But when their plucky Englishmen had put a bit of lead"
1130,WOLVERINE,"Right through the heart of one of them, an' rolled him over, dead,"
1131,WOLVERINE,The other cowards said that they had come on peace instead.
1132,WOLVERINE,
1133,WOLVERINE,"""'That they (the Whites) had lost some stores, from off their little pack,"
1134,WOLVERINE,"An' that the Red they peppered dead had followed up their track,"
1135,WOLVERINE,Because he'd found the packages an' came _to give them back_.'
1136,WOLVERINE,
1137,WOLVERINE,"""'Oh!' they said, 'they were quite sorry, but it wasn't like as if"
1138,WOLVERINE,"They had killed a decent Whiteman by mistake or in a tiff,"
1139,WOLVERINE,It was only some old Injun dog that lay there stark an' stiff.'
1140,WOLVERINE,
1141,WOLVERINE,"""I said, 'You are the meanest dogs that ever yet I seen,'"
1142,WOLVERINE,Then I rolled the body over as it lay out on the green;

1903,CLOSE BY,"To us, nor led astray"
1904,CLOSE BY,"Our footsteps, guiding us into love's land"
1905,CLOSE BY,That lay so near at hand.
1906,CLOSE BY,
1907,CLOSE BY,"So near at hand, dear heart, could we have known it!"
1908,CLOSE BY,"Throughout those dreamy hours,"
1909,CLOSE BY,"Had either loved, or loving had we shown it,"
1910,CLOSE BY,Response had sure been ours;

1912,CLOSE BY,And love so near at hand!
1913,CLOSE BY,
1914,CLOSE BY,What then availed the red wine's subtle glisten?
1915,CLOSE BY,"We passed it blindly by,"
1916,CLOSE BY,And now what profit that we wait and listen
1917,CLOSE BY,Each for the other's heart beat? Ah! the cry

1919,CLOSE BY,"Sought heaven afar, we did not understand"

1925,THE IDLERS,
1926,THE IDLERS,
1927,THE IDLERS,"The sun's red pulses beat,"
1928,THE IDLERS,"Full prodigal of heat,"
1929,THE IDLERS,Full lavish of its lustre unrepressed;
1930,THE IDLERS,But we have drifted far
1931,THE IDLERS,"From where his kisses are,"
1932,THE IDLERS,And in this landward-lying shade we let our paddles rest.
1933,THE IDLERS,
1934,THE IDLERS,"The river, deep and still,"
1935,THE IDLERS,"The maple-mantled hill,"
1936,THE IDLERS,"The little yellow beach whereon we lie,"
1937,THE IDLERS,"The puffs of heated breeze,"
1938,THE IDLERS,All sweetly whisper--These
1939,THE IDLERS,Are days that only come in a Canadian July.
1940,THE IDLERS,
1941,THE IDLERS,"So, silently we two"
1942,THE IDLERS,"Lounge in our still canoe,"
1943,THE IDLERS,"Nor fate, nor fortune matters to us now:"
1944,THE IDLERS,So long as we alone
1945,THE IDLERS,"May call this dream our own,"
1946,THE IDLERS,"The breeze may die, the sail may droop, we care not when or how."
1947,THE IDLERS,
1948,THE IDLERS,"Against the thwart, near by,"
1949,THE IDLERS,"Inactively you lie,"
1950,THE IDLERS,And all too near my arm your temple bends.
1951,THE IDLERS,"Your indolently crude,"
1952,THE IDLERS,"Abandoned attitude,"
1953,THE IDLERS,"Is one of ease and art, in which a perfect languor blends."
1954,THE IDLERS,
1955,THE IDLERS,"Your costume, loose and light,"
1956,THE IDLERS,Leaves unconcealed your might
1957,THE IDLERS,"Of muscle, half suspected, half defined;"
1958,THE IDLERS,"And falling well aside,"
1959,THE IDLERS,"Your vesture opens wide,"
1960,THE IDLERS,Above your splendid sunburnt throat that pulses unconfined.
1961,THE IDLERS,
1962,THE IDLERS,"With easy unreserve,"
1963,THE IDLERS,"Across the gunwale's curve,"
1964,THE IDLERS,"Your arm superb is lying, brown and bare;"
1965,THE IDLERS,Your hand just touches mine
1966,THE IDLERS,"With import firm and fine,"
1967,THE IDLERS,(I kiss the very wind that blows about your tumbled hair).
1968,THE IDLERS,
1969,THE IDLERS,"Ah! Dear, I am unwise"
1970,THE IDLERS,In echoing your eyes
1971,THE IDLERS,"Whene'er they leave their far-off gaze, and turn"
1972,THE IDLERS,To melt and blur my sight;
1973,THE IDLERS,For every other light
1974,THE IDLERS,"Is servile to your cloud-grey eyes, wherein cloud shadows burn."
1975,THE IDLERS,
1976,THE IDLERS,"But once the silence breaks,"
1977,THE IDLERS,But once your ardour wakes
1978,THE IDLERS,To words that humanize this lotus-land;
1979,THE IDLERS,So perfect and complete
1980,THE IDLERS,"Those burning words and sweet,"
1981,THE IDLERS,So perfect is the single kiss your lips lay on my hand.
1982,THE IDLERS,
1983,THE IDLERS,"The paddles lie disused,"
1984,THE IDLERS,"The fitful breeze abused,"
1985,THE IDLERS,"Has dropped to slumber, with no after-blow;"
1986,THE IDLERS,"And hearts will pay the cost,"
1987,THE IDLERS,For you and I have lost
1988,THE IDLERS,More than the homeward blowing wind that died an hour ago.

1995,AT SUNSET,To-night the west o'er-brims with warmest dyes;
1996,AT SUNSET,Its chalice overflows
1997,AT SUNSET,"With pools of purple colouring the skies,"
1998,AT SUNSET,Aflood with gold and rose;
1999,AT SUNSET,"And some hot soul seems throbbing close to mine,"
2000,AT SUNSET,As sinks the sun within that world of wine.
2001,AT SUNSET,
2002,AT SUNSET,I seem to hear a bar of music float
2003,AT SUNSET,And swoon into the west;
2004,AT SUNSET,"My ear can scarcely catch the whispered note,"
2005,AT SUNSET,But something in my breast
2006,AT SUNSET,"Blends with that strain, till both accord in one,"
2007,AT SUNSET,As cloud and colour blend at set of sun.
2008,AT SUNSET,
2009,AT SUNSET,"And twilight comes with grey and restful eyes,"
2010,AT SUNSET,As ashes follow flame.
2011,AT SUNSET,But O! I heard a voice from those rich skies
2012,AT SUNSET,Call tenderly my name;
2013,AT SUNSET,It was as if some priestly fingers stole
2014,AT SUNSET,In benedictions o'er my lonely soul.
2015,AT SUNSET,
2016,AT SUNSET,"I know not why, but all my being longed"
2017,AT SUNSET,And leapt at that sweet call;
2018,AT SUNSET,"My heart outreached its arms, all passion thronged"
2019,AT SUNSET,"And beat against Fate's wall,"
2020,AT SUNSET,Crying in utter homesickness to be

2031,PENSEROSO,Pulse of my pulse and consort of my dreams.
2032,PENSEROSO,

2037,PENSEROSO,

2043,PENSEROSO,"Let me but wander on the shore night-stilled,"
2044,PENSEROSO,Drinking its darkness till my soul is filled;
2045,PENSEROSO,"The breathing of the salt sea on my hair,"
2046,PENSEROSO,My outstretched hands but grasping empty air.
2047,PENSEROSO,
2048,PENSEROSO,Let me but feel the pulse of Nature's soul
2049,PENSEROSO,"Athrob on mine, let seas and thunders roll"

2073,RE-VOYAGE,Adrift in my canoe?

2075,RE-VOYAGE,Cleaving the waters through?

2077,RE-VOYAGE,Your restless pulse grows still?
2078,RE-VOYAGE,
2079,RE-VOYAGE,Do you not long to listen to the purling
2080,RE-VOYAGE,Of foam athwart the keel?
2081,RE-VOYAGE,To hear the nearing rapids softly swirling
2082,RE-VOYAGE,"Among their stones, to feel"

2084,RE-VOYAGE,The wild and snarling waves?

2086,RE-VOYAGE,"What need of question, what of your replying?"
2087,RE-VOYAGE,Oh! well I know that you
2088,RE-VOYAGE,Would toss the world away to be but lying
2089,RE-VOYAGE,"Again in my canoe,"
2090,RE-VOYAGE,"In listless indolence entranced and lost,"
2091,RE-VOYAGE,"Wave-rocked, and passion tossed."
2092,RE-VOYAGE,
2093,RE-VOYAGE,Ah me! my paddle failed me in the steering
2094,RE-VOYAGE,Across love's shoreless seas;
2095,RE-VOYAGE,"All reckless, I had ne'er a thought of fearing"
2096,RE-VOYAGE,"Such dreary days as these,"

2555,I,
2556,I,"Speak of you, sir? You bet he did. Ben Fields was far too sound"
2557,I,To go back on a fellow just because he weren't around.
2558,I,"Why, sir, he thought a lot of you, and only three months back"
2559,I,"Says he, ""The Squire will some time come a-snuffing out our track"
2560,I,"And give us the surprise."" And so I got to thinking then"
2561,I,"That any day you might drop down on Rove, and me, and Ben."
2562,I,"And now you've come for nothing, for the lad has left us two,"
2563,I,"And six long weeks ago, sir, he went up beyond the blue."
2564,I,
2565,I,"Who's Rove? Oh, he's the collie, and the only thing on earth"
2566,I,"That I will ever love again. Why, Squire, that dog is worth"
2567,I,"More than you ever handled, and that's quite a piece, I know."
2568,I,"Ah, there the beggar is!--come here, you scalawag! and show"
2569,I,"Your broken leg all bandaged up. Yes, sir, it's pretty sore;"
2570,I,"I did it,--curse me,--and I think I feel the pain far more"
2571,I,"Than him, for somehow I just feel as if I'd been untrue"
2572,I,To what my brother said before he went beyond the blue.
2573,I,
2574,I,"You see, the day before he died he says to me, ""Say, Ned,"
2575,I,"Be sure you take good care of poor old Rover when I'm dead,"
2576,I,"And maybe he will cheer your lonesome hours up a bit,"
2577,I,"And when he takes to you just see that you're deserving it."""
2578,I,"Well, Squire, it wasn't any use. I tried, but couldn't get"
2579,I,"The friendship of that collie, for I needed it, you bet."
2580,I,"I might as well have tried to get the moon to help me through,"
2581,I,"For Rover's heart had gone with Ben, 'way up beyond the blue."
2582,I,
2583,I,"He never seemed to take to me nor follow me about,"
2584,I,"For all I coaxed and petted, for my heart was starving out"
2585,I,"For want of some companionship,--I thought, if only he"
2586,I,"Would lick my hand or come and put his head aside my knee,"
2587,I,Perhaps his touch would scatter something of the gloom away.
2588,I,But all alone I had to live until there came a day
2589,I,"When, tired of the battle, as you'd have tired too,"
2590,I,"I wished to heaven I'd gone with Ben, 'way up beyond the blue."

2594,I,"One morning I took out Ben's gun, and thought I'd hunt all day,"
2595,I,"And started through the clearing for the bush that forward lay,"
2596,I,When something made me look around--I scarce believed my mind--
2597,I,"But, sure enough, the dog was following right close behind."
2598,I,"A feeling first of joy, and than a sharper, greater one"
2599,I,"Of anger came, at knowing 'twas not me, but Ben's old gun,"
2600,I,"That Rove was after,--well, sir, I just don't mind telling you,"
2601,I,But I forgot that moment Ben was up beyond the blue.
2602,I,
2603,I,"Perhaps it was but jealousy--perhaps it was despair,"
2604,I,But I just struck him with the gun and broke the bone right there;
2605,I,"And then--my very throat seemed choked, for he began to whine"
2606,I,With pain--God knows how tenderly I took that dog of mine
2607,I,"Up in my arms, and tore my old red necktie into bands"
2608,I,"To bind the broken leg, while there he lay and licked my hands;"
2609,I,"And though I cursed my soul, it was the brightest day I knew,"
2610,I,"Or even cared to live, since Ben went up beyond the blue."
2611,I,
2612,I,"I tell you, Squire, I nursed him just as gently as could be,"
2613,I,"And now I'm all the world to him, and he's the world to me."
2614,I,"Look, sir, at that big, noble soul, right in his faithful eyes,"
2615,I,"The square, forgiving honesty that deep down in them lies."
2616,I,"Eh, Squire? What's that you say? _He's got no soul?_ I tell you, then,"
2617,I,He's grander and he's better than the mass of what's called men;
2618,I,And I guess he stands a better chance than many of us do
2619,I,"Of seeing Ben some day again, 'way up beyond the blue."
