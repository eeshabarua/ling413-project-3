58,HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.,"in the Play of ""The Robbers.""]"
59,HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.,
60,ANDROMACHE.,ANDROMACHE.
61,ANDROMACHE.,"Will Hector leave me for the fatal plain,"
62,ANDROMACHE.,"Where, fierce with vengeance for Patroclus slain,"
63,ANDROMACHE.,Stalks Peleus' ruthless son?
64,ANDROMACHE.,"Who, when thou glid'st amid the dark abodes,"
65,ANDROMACHE.,"To hurl the spear and to revere the gods,"
66,ANDROMACHE.,Shall teach thine orphan one?
67,ANDROMACHE.,
68,HECTOR.,HECTOR.
69,HECTOR.,Woman and wife beloved--cease thy tears;
70,HECTOR.,My soul is nerved--the war-clang in my ears!
71,HECTOR.,Be mine in life to stand
72,HECTOR.,"Troy's bulwark!--fighting for our hearths, to go"
73,HECTOR.,"In death, exulting to the streams below,"
74,HECTOR.,Slain for my fatherland!
75,HECTOR.,
76,ANDROMACHE.,ANDROMACHE.
77,ANDROMACHE.,No more I hear thy martial footsteps fall--
78,ANDROMACHE.,"Thine arms shall hang, dull trophies, on the wall--"
79,ANDROMACHE.,Fallen the stem of Troy!
80,ANDROMACHE.,Thou goest where slow Cocytus wanders--where
81,ANDROMACHE.,"Love sinks in Lethe, and the sunless air"
82,ANDROMACHE.,Is dark to light and joy!
83,ANDROMACHE.,
84,HECTOR.,HECTOR.
85,HECTOR.,"Longing and thought--yes, all I feel and think"

96,AMALIA.,
97,AMALIA.,"Angel-fair, Walhalla's charms displaying,"
98,AMALIA.,Fairer than all mortal youths was he;
99,AMALIA.,"Mild his look, as May-day sunbeams straying"
100,AMALIA.,Gently o'er the blue and glassy sea.
101,AMALIA.,
102,AMALIA.,And his kisses!--what ecstatic feeling!
103,AMALIA.,"Like two flames that lovingly entwine,"
104,AMALIA.,Like the harp's soft tones together stealing
105,AMALIA.,"Into one sweet harmony divine,--"
106,AMALIA.,
107,AMALIA.,"Soul and soul embraced, commingled, blended,"
108,AMALIA.,"Lips and cheeks with trembling passion burned,"

110,AMALIA.,Round the blissful lovers madly turn'd.
111,AMALIA.,
112,AMALIA.,"He is gone--and, ah! with bitter anguish"
113,AMALIA.,Vainly now I breathe my mournful sighs;
114,AMALIA.,He is gone--in hopeless grief I languish

120,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.
121,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
122,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Pale, at its ghastly noon,"
123,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Pauses above the death-still wood--the moon;
124,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"The night-sprite, sighing, through the dim air stirs;"
125,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,The clouds descend in rain;
126,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Mourning, the wan stars wane,"
127,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Flickering like dying lamps in sepulchres!
128,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Haggard as spectres--vision-like and dumb,"
129,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Dark with the pomp of death, and moving slow,"
130,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Towards that sad lair the pale procession come
131,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Where the grave closes on the night below.
132,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
133,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"With dim, deep-sunken eye,"
134,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Crutched on his staff, who trembles tottering by?"
135,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"As wrung from out the shattered heart, one groan"
136,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Breaks the deep hush alone!
137,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Crushed by the iron fate, he seems to gather"
138,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"All life's last strength to stagger to the bier,"
139,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"And hearken--Do these cold lips murmur ""Father?"""
140,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"The sharp rain, drizzling through that place of fear,"
141,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Pierces the bones gnawed fleshless by despair,"
142,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,And the heart's horror stirs the silver hair.
143,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
144,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Fresh bleed the fiery wounds
145,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Through all that agonizing heart undone--
146,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Still on the voiceless lips ""my Father"" sounds,"
147,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"And still the childless Father murmurs ""Son!"""
148,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Ice-cold--ice-cold, in that white shroud he lies--"
149,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Thy sweet and golden dreams all vanished there--
150,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"The sweet and golden name of ""Father"" dies"
151,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Into thy curse,--ice-cold--ice-cold--he lies!"
152,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Dead, what thy life's delight and Eden were!"
153,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
154,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Mild, as when, fresh from the arms of Aurora,"
155,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"While the air like Elysium is smiling above,"
156,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Steeped in rose-breathing odors, the darling of Flora"
157,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Wantons over the blooms on his winglets of love.
158,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"So gay, o'er the meads, went his footsteps in bliss,"
159,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,The silver wave mirrored the smile of his face;
160,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Delight, like a flame, kindled up at his kiss,"
161,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,And the heart of the maid was the prey of his chase.
162,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
163,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Boldly he sprang to the strife of the world,"
164,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,As a deer to the mountain-top carelessly springs;
165,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"As an eagle whose plumes to the sun are unfurled,"
166,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Swept his hope round the heaven on its limitless wings.
167,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Proud as a war-horse that chafes at the rein,"
168,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"That, kingly, exults in the storm of the brave;"
169,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"That throws to the wind the wild stream of its mane,"
170,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Strode he forth by the prince and the slave!
171,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
172,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Life like a spring day, serene and divine,"
173,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,In the star of the morning went by as a trance;
174,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"His murmurs he drowned in the gold of the wine,"
175,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,And his sorrows were borne on the wave of the dance.
176,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
177,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Worlds lay concealed in the hopes of his youth!--
178,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,When once he shall ripen to manhood and fame!
179,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Fond father exult!--In the germs of his youth
180,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,What harvests are destined for manhood and fame!
181,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
182,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Not to be was that manhood!--The death-bell is knelling,"
183,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,The hinge of the death-vault creaks harsh on the ears--
184,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"How dismal, O Death, is the place of thy dwelling!"
185,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Not to be was that manhood!--Flow on, bitter tears!"
186,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Go, beloved, thy path to the sun,"
187,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Rise, world upon world, with the perfect to rest;"
188,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Go--quaff the delight which thy spirit has won,"
189,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,And escape from our grief in the Halls of the Blest.
190,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
191,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Again (in that thought what a healing is found!)
192,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,To meet in the Eden to which thou art fled!--
193,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Hark, the coffin sinks down with a dull, sullen sound,"
194,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,And the ropes rattle over the sleep of the dead.
195,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"And we cling to each other!--O Grave, he is thine!"
196,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,The eye tells the woe that is mute to the ears--
197,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"And we dare to resent what we grudge to resign,"
198,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Till the heart's sinful murmur is choked in its tears.
199,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Pale at its ghastly noon,"
200,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Pauses above the death-still wood--the moon!
201,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"The night-sprite, sighing, through the dim air stirs:"
202,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,The clouds descend in rain;
203,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Mourning, the wan stars wane,"
204,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Flickering like dying lamps in sepulchres.
205,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,The dull clods swell into the sullen mound;
206,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,"Earth, one look yet upon the prey we gave!"
207,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,The grave locks up the treasure it has found;
208,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Higher and higher swells the sullen mound--
209,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,Never gives back the grave!
210,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,
211,A FUNERAL FANTASIE.,

221,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,See! it teaches yonder roving planets
222,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Round the sun to fly in endless race;
223,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"And as children play around their mother,"
224,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Checkered circles round the orb to trace.
225,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
226,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Every rolling star, by thirst tormented,"
227,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Drinks with joy its bright and golden rain--

238,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"O'er thy systems thou wouldst weep, great Newton,"
239,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,When with giant force to chaos hurled!
240,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
241,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Blot the goddess from the spirit order,"
242,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"It would sink in death, and ne'er arise."

244,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Were love absent, none their God would prize!"
245,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
246,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"What is that, which, when my Laura kisses,"
247,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Dyes my cheek with flames of purple hue,"
248,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Bids my bosom bound with swifter motion,"
249,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Like a fever wild my veins runs through?
250,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
251,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Every nerve from out its barriers rises,"
252,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"O'er its banks, the blood begins to flow;"
253,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Body seeks to join itself to body,"
254,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Spirits kindle in one blissful glow.
255,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
256,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Powerful as in the dead creations
257,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"That eternal impulses obey,"
258,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"O'er the web Arachne-like of Nature,--"
259,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Living Nature,--Love exerts her sway."
260,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
261,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Laura, see how joyousness embraces"
262,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,E'en the overflow of sorrows wild!
263,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,How e'en rigid desperation kindles
264,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,On the loving breast of Hope so mild.
265,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
266,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Sisterly and blissful rapture softens
267,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Gloomy Melancholy's fearful night,"
268,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"And, deliver'd of its golden children,"
269,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Lo, the eye pours forth its radiance bright!"
270,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
271,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Does not awful Sympathy rule over
272,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,E'en the realms that Evil calls its own?
273,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"For 'tis Hell our crimes are ever wooing,"
274,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,While they bear a grudge 'gainst Heaven alone!
275,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
276,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Shame, Repentance, pair Eumenides-like,"
277,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Weave round sin their fearful serpent-coils:
278,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,While around the eagle-wings of Greatness
279,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Treach'rous danger winds its dreaded toils.

287,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,In the arms of ages past to lie;
288,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"And Saturnus, as he onward speeds him,"
289,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,Long hath sought his bride--Eternity!
290,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,
291,FANTASIE--TO LAURA.,"Soon Saturnus will his bride discover,--"

1963,JUNO.,Back into Hecate's gloomy arms once more!
1964,JUNO.,Ye gods! And is it thus that Beroe
1965,JUNO.,"Finds Cadmus' daughter, after sixteen years"
1966,JUNO.,Of bitter separation! Full of joy
1967,JUNO.,I came from Epidaurus; but with shame
1968,JUNO.,To Epidaurus must retrace my steps.--
1969,JUNO.,"Despair I take with me. Alas, my people!"
1970,JUNO.,E'en to the second Deluge now the plague
1971,JUNO.,"May rage at will, may pile mount Oeta high"
1972,JUNO.,"With corpses upon corpses, and may turn"
1973,JUNO.,"All Greece into one mighty charnel-house,"
1974,JUNO.,Ere Semele can bend the angry gods.
1975,JUNO.,"I, thou, and Greece, and all, have been betrayed!"
1976,JUNO.,
1977,JUNO.,"SEMELE. (Trembling as she rises, and extending an arm towards her.)"
1978,JUNO.,"Oh, Beroe!"
1979,JUNO.,
1980,JUNO.,"JUNO.    Take courage, my dear heart!"
1981,JUNO.,Perchance 'tis Zeus! although it scarce can be!
1982,JUNO.,Perchance 'tis really Zeus! This we must learn!
1983,JUNO.,"He must disclose himself to thee, or thou"
1984,JUNO.,"Must fly his sight forever, and devote"
1985,JUNO.,The monster to the death-revenge of Thebes.
1986,JUNO.,"Look up, dear daughter--look upon the face"
1987,JUNO.,"Of thine own Beroe, who looks on thee"
1988,JUNO.,"With sympathizing eyes--my Semele,"
1989,JUNO.,Were it not well to try him?
1990,JUNO.,
1991,JUNO.,"SEMELE.            No, by heaven!"
1992,JUNO.,I should not find him then--
1993,JUNO.,
1994,JUNO.,JUNO.             What! Wilt thou be
1995,JUNO.,"Perchance less wretched, if thou pinest on"
1996,JUNO.,"In mournful doubt?--and if 'tis really he,--"
1997,JUNO.,
1998,JUNO.,SEMELE. (Hiding her face in Juno's lap.)
1999,JUNO.,Ah! 'tis not he!
2000,JUNO.,
2001,JUNO.,JUNO.       And if he came to thee
2002,JUNO.,Arrayed in all the majesty wherein
2003,JUNO.,Olympus sees him? Semele! What then?
2004,JUNO.,Wouldst thou repent thee then of having tried him?
2005,JUNO.,
2006,JUNO.,SEMELE. (Springing up.)
2007,JUNO.,Ha! be it so! He must unveil himself!
2008,JUNO.,
2009,JUNO.,JUNO. (Hastily.)
2010,JUNO.,Thou must not let him sink into thine arms.
2011,JUNO.,"Till he unveils himself--so hearken, child,"
2012,JUNO.,"To what thy faithful nurse now counsels thee,--"
2013,JUNO.,"To what affection whispers in mine ear,"
2014,JUNO.,And will accomplish!--Say! will he soon come?
2015,JUNO.,
2016,SEMELE.,SEMELE.
2017,SEMELE.,"Before Hyperion sinks in Thetis' bed,"
2018,SEMELE.,He promised to appear.
2019,SEMELE.,
2020,SEMELE.,"JUNO. (Forgetting herself hastily.) Is't so, indeed?"
2021,SEMELE.,"He promised? Ha! To-day? (Recovering herself.) Let him approach,"
2022,SEMELE.,"And when he would attempt, inflamed with love,"
2023,SEMELE.,"To clasp his arms around thee, then do thou,--"
2024,SEMELE.,"Observe me well,--as if by lightning struck,"
2025,SEMELE.,Start back in haste. Ha! picture his surprise!
2026,SEMELE.,"Leave him not long in wonderment, my child;"
2027,SEMELE.,Continue to repulse him with a look
2028,SEMELE.,"As cold as ice--more wildly, with more ardor"
2029,SEMELE.,He'll press thee then--the coyness of the fair
2030,SEMELE.,"Is but a dam, that for awhile keeps back"
2031,SEMELE.,"The torrent, only to increase the flood"
2032,SEMELE.,With greater fury. Then begin to weep
2033,SEMELE.,"'Gainst giants he might stand,--look calmly on"
2034,SEMELE.,"When Typheus, hundred-armed, in fury hurled"
2035,SEMELE.,Mount Ossa and Olympus 'gainst his throne:
2036,SEMELE.,But Zeus is soon subdued by beauty's tears.
2037,SEMELE.,"Thou smilest?--Be it so! Is, then, the scholar"
2038,SEMELE.,"Wiser, perchance, than she who teaches her?--"
2039,SEMELE.,"Then thou must pray the god one little, little"
2040,SEMELE.,Most innocent request to grant to thee--
2041,SEMELE.,One that may seal his love and godhead too.
2042,SEMELE.,He'll swear by Styx. The Styx he must obey!
2043,SEMELE.,That oath he dares not break! Then speak these words:
2044,SEMELE.,"""Thou shalt not touch this body, till thou comest"
2045,SEMELE.,To Cadmus' daughter clothed in all the might
2046,SEMELE.,"Wherein thou art embraced by Kronos' daughter!"""
2047,SEMELE.,"Be not thou terrified, my Semele,"
2048,SEMELE.,"If he, in order to escape thy wish,"
2049,SEMELE.,As bugbears paints the horrors of his presence--
2050,SEMELE.,"Describes the flames that round about him roar,"
2051,SEMELE.,The thunder round him rolling when he comes:
2052,SEMELE.,"These, Semele, are naught but empty fears--"
2053,SEMELE.,The gods dislike to show to us frail mortals
2054,SEMELE.,These the most glorious of their attributes;
2055,SEMELE.,"Be thou but obstinate in thy request,"
2056,SEMELE.,And Juno's self will gaze on thee with envy.
2057,SEMELE.,
2058,SEMELE.,SEMELE.
2059,SEMELE.,The frightful ox-eyed one! How often he
2060,SEMELE.,"Complains, in the blest moments of our love,"
2061,SEMELE.,Of her tormenting him with her black gall--
2062,SEMELE.,
2063,SEMELE.,"JUNO. (Aside, furiously, but with embarrassment.)"
2064,SEMELE.,Ha! creature! Thou shalt die for this contempt!
2065,SEMELE.,
2066,SEMELE.,SEMELE.
2067,SEMELE.,My Beroe! What art thou murmuring there?
2068,SEMELE.,
2069,SEMELE.,JUNO. (In confusion.)
2070,SEMELE.,"Nothing, my Semele! Black gall torments"
2071,SEMELE.,"Me also--Yes! a sharp, reproachful look"
2072,SEMELE.,With lovers often passes as black gall--
2073,SEMELE.,"Yet ox-eyes, after all, are not so ugly."
2074,SEMELE.,
2075,SEMELE.,SEMELE.
2076,SEMELE.,"Oh, Beroe, for shame! they're quite the worst"
2077,SEMELE.,That any head can possibly contain!
2078,SEMELE.,"And then her cheeks of green and yellow hues,"
2079,SEMELE.,The obvious penalty of poisonous envy--
2080,SEMELE.,Zeus oft complains to me that that same shrew
2081,SEMELE.,"Each night torments him with her nauseous love,"
2082,SEMELE.,"And with her jealous whims,--enough, I'm sure,"
2083,SEMELE.,Into Ixion's wheel to turn all heaven.
2084,SEMELE.,
2085,SEMELE.,JUNO. (Raving up and down in extreme confusion.)
2086,SEMELE.,No more of this!
2087,SEMELE.,
2088,SEMELE.,"SEMELE.      What, Beroe! So angry?"
2089,SEMELE.,Have I said more than what is true? Said more
2090,SEMELE.,Than what is wise?
2091,SEMELE.,
2092,SEMELE.,"JUNO.        Thou hast said more, young woman,"
2093,SEMELE.,Than what is true--said more than what is wise!
2094,SEMELE.,"Deem thyself truly blest, if thy blue eyes"
2095,SEMELE.,Smile thee not into Charon's bark too soon!
2096,SEMELE.,"Saturnia has her altars and her temples,"
2097,SEMELE.,And wanders amongst mortals--that great goddess
2098,SEMELE.,Avenges naught so bitterly as scorn
2099,SEMELE.,
2100,SEMELE.,SEMELE.
2101,SEMELE.,"Here let her wander, and give birth to scorn!"
2102,SEMELE.,What is't to me?--My Jupiter protects
2103,SEMELE.,"My every hair,--what harm can Juno do?"
2104,SEMELE.,"But now, enough of this, my Beroe!"
2105,SEMELE.,Zeus must appear to-day in all his glory;
2106,SEMELE.,And if Saturnia should on that account
2107,SEMELE.,Find out the path to Orcus--
2108,SEMELE.,
2109,SEMELE.,JUNO. (Aside.)        That same path
2110,SEMELE.,"Another probably will find before her,"
2111,SEMELE.,If but Kronion's lightning hits the mark!--
2112,SEMELE.,(To Semele.)
2113,SEMELE.,"Yes, Semele, she well may burst with envy"
2114,SEMELE.,"When Cadmus' daughter, in the sight of Greece,"
2115,SEMELE.,Ascends in triumph to Olympus' heights!--
2116,SEMELE.,
2117,SEMELE.,SEMELE. (Smiling gently.)
2118,SEMELE.,Thinkest thou they'll hear in Greece of Cadmus' daughter?
2119,SEMELE.,
2120,SEMELE.,JUNO. From Sidon to Athens the trumpet of fame
2121,SEMELE.,Shall ring with no other but Semele's name!
2122,SEMELE.,"The gods from the heavens shall even descend,"
2123,SEMELE.,"And before thee their knees in deep homage shall bend,"
2124,SEMELE.,While mortals in silent submission abide
2125,SEMELE.,The will of the giant-destroyer's loved bride;
2126,SEMELE.,And when distant years shall see
2127,SEMELE.,Thy last hour--
2128,SEMELE.,
2129,SEMELE.,"SEMELE. (Springing up, and falling on her neck.)"
2130,SEMELE.,"Oh, Beroe!"
2131,SEMELE.,
2132,SEMELE.,JUNO. Then a tablet white shall bear
2133,SEMELE.,This inscription graven there:
2134,SEMELE.,Here is worshipped Semele!
2135,SEMELE.,Who on earth so fair as she?
2136,SEMELE.,She who from Olympus' throne
2137,SEMELE.,Lured the thunder-hurler down!
2138,SEMELE.,"She who, with her kisses sweet,"
2139,SEMELE.,Laid him prostrate at her feet!
2140,SEMELE.,"And when fame on her thousand wings bears it around,"
2141,SEMELE.,The echo from valley and hill shall resound.
2142,SEMELE.,
2143,SEMELE.,SEMELE. (Beside herself.)
2144,SEMELE.,Pythia! Apollo! Hear!
2145,SEMELE.,"When, oh when will he appear?"
2146,SEMELE.,
2147,SEMELE.,JUNO. And on smoking altars they
2148,SEMELE.,Rites divine to thee shall pay--
2149,SEMELE.,
2150,SEMELE.,SEMELE. (Inspired.)
2151,SEMELE.,"I will harken to their prayer,"
2152,SEMELE.,"And will drive away their care,--"
2153,SEMELE.,"Quench with my tears the lightning of great Jove,"
2154,SEMELE.,His breast to pity with entreaty move!
2155,SEMELE.,
2156,SEMELE.,JUNO. (Aside.)
2157,SEMELE.,Poor thing! that wilt thou ne'er have power to do. (Meditating.)
2158,SEMELE.,Ere long will melt . . . yet--yet--she called me ugly!--
2159,SEMELE.,No pity only when in Tartarus!
2160,SEMELE.,(To Semele.)
2161,SEMELE.,"Fly now, my love! Make haste to leave this spot,"
2162,SEMELE.,That Zeus may not observe thee--Let him wait
2163,SEMELE.,"Long for thy coming, that he with more fire"
2164,SEMELE.,May languish for thee--
2165,SEMELE.,
2166,SEMELE.,SEMELE.         Beroe! The heavens
2167,SEMELE.,Have chosen thee their mouthpiece! Happy I!
2168,SEMELE.,"The gods from Olympus shall even descend,"
2169,SEMELE.,"And before me their knees in deep homage shall bend,"
2170,SEMELE.,While mortals in silent submission abide--
2171,SEMELE.,But hold!--'tis time for me to haste away!
2172,SEMELE.,[Exit hurriedly.
2173,SEMELE.,
2174,SEMELE.,JUNO. (Looking after her with exultation.)
2175,SEMELE.,"Weak, proud, and easily-deluded woman!"
2176,SEMELE.,His tender looks shall be consuming fire--
2177,SEMELE.,"His kiss, annihilation--his embrace,"
2178,SEMELE.,A raging tempest to thee! Human frames
2179,SEMELE.,Are powerless to endure the dreaded presence
2180,SEMELE.,Of him who wields the thunderbolt on high!
2181,SEMELE.,(With raving ecstasy.)
2182,SEMELE.,Ha! when her waxen mortal body melts
2183,SEMELE.,"Within the arms of him, the fire-distilling,"
2184,SEMELE.,As melts the fleecy snow before the heat
2185,SEMELE.,Of the bright sun--and when the perjured one
2186,SEMELE.,"In place of his soft tender bride, embraces"
2187,SEMELE.,A form of terror--with what ecstasy
2188,SEMELE.,"Shall I gaze downwards from Cithaeron's height,"
2189,SEMELE.,"Exclaiming, so that in his hand the bolt"
2190,SEMELE.,"Shall quake: ""For shame, Saturnius! Fie, for shame!"
2191,SEMELE.,"What need is there for thee to clasp so roughly?"""
2192,SEMELE.,[Exit hastily.

2209,ZEUS.,Thy pinions' flight toward far Scamander's bank!
2210,ZEUS.,A shepherd there is weeping o'er the grave

2245,ZEUS.,So wont to ring with wild bacchantic shouts--
2246,ZEUS.,No breath is stirring--on Cithaeron's height

2254,ZEUS.,Take courage!--I'm thy Zeus! the scattered heavens

2257,ZEUS.,Roughly to blow on her whom Zeus calls His?
2258,ZEUS.,"I scoff at all her malice.--Where art thou,"
2259,ZEUS.,O Semele? I long have pined to rest
2260,ZEUS.,"My world-tormented head upon thy breast,--"
2261,ZEUS.,To lull my wearied senses to repose
2262,ZEUS.,"From the wild storm of earthly joys and woes,--"
2263,ZEUS.,"To dream away the emblems of my might,"
