70,INTRODUCTION,
71,INTRODUCTION,
72,INTRODUCTION,The pieces reproduced in this little volume are now beginning to bid for
73,INTRODUCTION,"notice from their third century of readers. At the time they were written,"
74,INTRODUCTION,although Johnson had already done enough miscellaneous literary work to
75,INTRODUCTION,"fill several substantial volumes, his name, far from identifying an ""Age"","
76,INTRODUCTION,was virtually unknown to the general public. _The Vanity of Human Wishes_
77,INTRODUCTION,was the first of his writings to bear his name on its face. There were
78,INTRODUCTION,"some who knew him to be the author of the vigorous satire, _London_, and"
79,INTRODUCTION,"of the still more remarkable biographical study, _An Account of the Life"
80,INTRODUCTION,of Mr. Richard Savage_; and a few interested persons were aware that he
81,INTRODUCTION,"was engaged in compiling an English Dictionary, and intended to edit"
82,INTRODUCTION,"Shakespeare. He was also, at the moment, attracting brief but not"
83,INTRODUCTION,over-favorable attention as the author of one of the season's new crop of
84,INTRODUCTION,tragedies at Drury Lane. But _The Vanity of Human Wishes_ and _The
85,INTRODUCTION,Rambler_ were a potent force in establishing Johnson's claim to a
86,INTRODUCTION,permanent place in English letters. _The Vanity_ appeared early in
87,INTRODUCTION,"January, 1749; _The Rambler_ ran from March 20, 1749/50 to March 14, 1752."
88,INTRODUCTION,"With the exception of five numbers and two quoted letters, the periodical"
89,INTRODUCTION,was written entirely by Johnson.
90,INTRODUCTION,
91,INTRODUCTION,"As moral essays, the Ramblers deeply stirred some readers and bored"
92,INTRODUCTION,"others. Young Boswell, not unduly saturnine in temperament, was profoundly"
93,INTRODUCTION,impressed by them and determined on their account to seek out the author.
94,INTRODUCTION,"Taine, a century later, discovered that he already knew by heart all they"
95,INTRODUCTION,"had to teach and warned his readers away from them. Generally speaking,"
96,INTRODUCTION,they were valued as they deserved by the eighteenth century and
97,INTRODUCTION,undervalued by the nineteenth. The first half of the twentieth has shown a
98,INTRODUCTION,"marked impulse to restore them, as a series, to a place of honor second"
99,INTRODUCTION,"only to the work of Addison and Steele in the same form. Raleigh, in 1907,"
100,INTRODUCTION,"paid discriminating tribute to their humanity. If read, he observed,"
101,INTRODUCTION,"against a knowledge of their author's life, ""the pages of _The Rambler_"
102,INTRODUCTION,"are aglow with the earnestness of dear-bought conviction, and rich in"
103,INTRODUCTION,"conclusions gathered not from books but from life and suffering."" And"
104,INTRODUCTION,"later: ""We come to closer quarters with Johnson in the best pages of _The"
105,INTRODUCTION,Rambler_ than in the most brilliant of the conversations recalled by
106,INTRODUCTION,"Boswell. The hero of a hundred fights puts off his armour, and becomes a"
107,INTRODUCTION,"wise and tender confessor."" Latterly, the style of Johnson's essays has"
108,INTRODUCTION,been subjected to a closer scrutiny than ever before. What Taine found as
109,INTRODUCTION,inflexible and inert as a pudding-mold is now seen to be charged with life
110,INTRODUCTION,"and movement, vibrant with light and shadow and color. More particularly,"
111,INTRODUCTION,Wimsatt has shown how intimately connected is the vocabulary of _The
112,INTRODUCTION,"Rambler_ with Johnson's reading for the Dictionary, and how, having"
113,INTRODUCTION,"mastered the words of the experimental scientists of the previous century,"
114,INTRODUCTION,"Johnson proceeded to put them to original uses, generating with them new"
115,INTRODUCTION,"stylistic overtones in contexts now humorously precise, now"
116,INTRODUCTION,"philosophically metaphorical, employing them now for purposes of irony and"
117,INTRODUCTION,"satire, and again for striking directly home to the roots of morality and"
118,INTRODUCTION,"religion. In a playful mood, he is never more characteristic than when he"
119,INTRODUCTION,"is his own mimic, propounding with mock seriousness some preposterous"
120,INTRODUCTION,theory like that of the intellectual advantages of living in a garret:
121,INTRODUCTION,
122,INTRODUCTION,I have discovered ... that the tenuity of a defecated air at a proper
123,INTRODUCTION,"distance from the surface of the earth accelerates the fancy, and sets"
124,INTRODUCTION,at liberty those intellectual powers which were before shackled by too
125,INTRODUCTION,"strong attraction, and unable to expand themselves under the pressure of"
126,INTRODUCTION,a gross atmosphere. I have found dullness to quicken into sentiment in a
127,INTRODUCTION,"thin ether, as water, though not very hot, boils in a receiver partly"
128,INTRODUCTION,"exhausted; and heads, in appearance empty, have teemed with notions upon"
129,INTRODUCTION,"rising ground, as the flaccid sides of a football would have swelled out"
130,INTRODUCTION,into stiffness and extension.
131,INTRODUCTION,
132,INTRODUCTION,"This is one side of his genius; but another, and profounder, appears in"
133,INTRODUCTION,"the eloquent simplicity of such a passage as the following, against our"
134,INTRODUCTION,fears of lessening ourselves in the eyes of others:
135,INTRODUCTION,
136,INTRODUCTION,The most useful medicines are often unpleasing to the taste. Those who
137,INTRODUCTION,"are oppressed by their own reputation will, perhaps, not be comforted by"
138,INTRODUCTION,hearing that their cares are unnecessary. But the truth is that no man
139,INTRODUCTION,is much regarded by the rest of the world. He that considers how little
140,INTRODUCTION,"he dwells upon the condition of others, will learn how little the"
141,INTRODUCTION,attention of others is attracted to himself. While we see multitudes
142,INTRODUCTION,"passing before us, of whom, perhaps, not one appears to deserve our"
143,INTRODUCTION,"notice, or excite our sympathy, we should remember that we likewise are"
144,INTRODUCTION,lost in the same throng; that the eye which happens to glance upon us is
145,INTRODUCTION,"turned in a moment on him that follows us, and that the utmost which we"
146,INTRODUCTION,"can reasonably hope or fear is, to fill a vacant hour with prattle, and"
147,INTRODUCTION,be forgotten.
148,INTRODUCTION,
149,INTRODUCTION,"When we approach Johnson's poetry, the revolution of taste becomes a more"
150,INTRODUCTION,acute consideration. It seems very nearly impossible to compare or
151,INTRODUCTION,contrast eighteenth-century poetry and that of the twentieth without
152,INTRODUCTION,"wilfully tipping the scales in one direction or the other, judgment in"
153,INTRODUCTION,this area being so much influenced by preference. But let us begin with
154,INTRODUCTION,"titles. For a start, let us take, from a recent Pulitzer Prize-winner:"
155,INTRODUCTION,"""The Day's No Rounder Than Its Angles Are"", and ""Don't Look Now But"
156,INTRODUCTION,"Mary Is Everybody""; from another distinguished current volume, these:"
157,INTRODUCTION,"""The Trance"", ""Lost"", ""Meeting""; from another, ""After This, Sea"", ""Lineman"
158,INTRODUCTION,"Calling"", ""Meaning Motion""; and from a fourth, ""Terror"", ""Picnic"
159,INTRODUCTION,"Remembered"", ""Eidolon"", and ""Monologue at Midnight"". Here are individual"
160,INTRODUCTION,"assertions, suggestive of individual ways of looking at things; here"
161,INTRODUCTION,are headings that signalize particular events in the authors'
162,INTRODUCTION,"experience,--moments' monuments. Beside them, Johnson's title, ""The Vanity"
163,INTRODUCTION,"of Human Wishes"", looks very dogged and downright."
164,INTRODUCTION,
165,INTRODUCTION,Titles are not poems but they have a barometric function. The modern
166,INTRODUCTION,"titles cited above are evocative of a world with which, for the past"
167,INTRODUCTION,"century and a half, we have been growing increasingly familiar. This air"
168,INTRODUCTION,we are accustomed to breathe: it requires no unusual effort of adjustment
169,INTRODUCTION,from us. We readily understand that we are being invited to participate in
170,INTRODUCTION,"a private experience and, by sharing it, to help in giving it as much"
171,INTRODUCTION,universality as may be. It is by no means easy for readers of to-day to
172,INTRODUCTION,"reverse the process, to start with the general and find in it their"
173,INTRODUCTION,"personal account. We are more likely to feel a resentment, or at least a"
174,INTRODUCTION,"prejudice, against the writer who solicits our attention to a topic"
175,INTRODUCTION,without even the pretense of novelty.
176,INTRODUCTION,
177,INTRODUCTION,Johnson's generation would have found it equally hard to see the matter
178,INTRODUCTION,"from our point of view, or to allow that the authors of the poems named"
179,INTRODUCTION,above were being less than impudent or at best flippant in thus brazenly
180,INTRODUCTION,"obtruding their private experience, undisguised, before the reader. We"
181,INTRODUCTION,"ought, moreover, to realize that in this judgment they would have the"
182,INTRODUCTION,"suffrages of all previous generations, including the greatest writers,"
183,INTRODUCTION,"from classical times down to their own. It is we who are singular, not"
184,INTRODUCTION,"they. Quite apart from considerations of moral right or wrong, of artistic"
185,INTRODUCTION,"good or bad, it obviously, therefore, behooves us to try to cultivate a"
186,INTRODUCTION,habit of mind free from initial bias against so large a proportion of
187,INTRODUCTION,recorded testimony.
188,INTRODUCTION,
189,INTRODUCTION,"Very early in _The Rambler_ Johnson remarks characteristically that ""men"
190,INTRODUCTION,"more frequently require to be reminded than informed."" He believed this,"
191,INTRODUCTION,"and his generation believed it, because they thought that human nature"
192,INTRODUCTION,changed little from age to age. The problems of conduct that confront the
193,INTRODUCTION,"living individual have been faced countless times by his predecessors, and"
194,INTRODUCTION,the accumulated experience of mankind has arrived at conclusions which in
195,INTRODUCTION,the main are just and therefore helpful to-day. The most important truths
196,INTRODUCTION,are those which have been known for a very long time. For that very reason
197,INTRODUCTION,they tend to be ignored or slighted unless they are restated in such a way
198,INTRODUCTION,as to arrest attention while they compel assent. Hence the best writing is
199,INTRODUCTION,that which most successfully resolves the paradox of combining the
200,INTRODUCTION,sharpest surprise with the widest recognition. Such an ideal is so
201,INTRODUCTION,"difficult of attainment that, inevitably, many who subscribed to it"
202,INTRODUCTION,succeeded only in unleavened platitude and others rejected it for the
203,INTRODUCTION,easier goal of novelty.
204,INTRODUCTION,
205,INTRODUCTION,In this most difficult class _The Vanity of Human Wishes_ has won a
206,INTRODUCTION,"respectable place. It is freighted with a double cargo, the wisdom of two"
207,INTRODUCTION,"great civilizations, pagan and Christian. Although based upon Juvenal's"
208,INTRODUCTION,"tenth Satire, it is so free a paraphrase as to be an original poem. The"
209,INTRODUCTION,English reader who sets it against Dryden's closer version will sense
210,INTRODUCTION,immediately its greater weight. It is informed with Johnson's own sombre
211,INTRODUCTION,and most deeply rooted emotional responses to the meaning of experience.
212,INTRODUCTION,"These, although emanating from a devout practising Christian and certainly"
213,INTRODUCTION,"not inconsistent with Christianity, neither reflect the specific articles"
214,INTRODUCTION,of Christian doctrine nor are lightened by the happiness of Christian
215,INTRODUCTION,faith: they are strongly infused with classical resignation.
216,INTRODUCTION,
217,INTRODUCTION,The poem is difficult as well as weighty. At times its expression is so
218,INTRODUCTION,"condensed that the meaning must be wrestled for. Statements so packed as,"
219,INTRODUCTION,"for example,"
220,INTRODUCTION,
221,INTRODUCTION,"Fate wings with ev'ry wish th' afflictive dart,"
222,INTRODUCTION,"Each gift of nature, and each grace of art,"
223,INTRODUCTION,
224,INTRODUCTION,"do not yield their full intention to the running reader. One line,"
225,INTRODUCTION,"indeed,--the eighth from the end (361)--has perhaps never been"
226,INTRODUCTION,satisfactorily explained by any commentator. (The eighteenth paragraph of
227,INTRODUCTION,Johnson's first sermon might go far to clarify it.) But such difficulties
228,INTRODUCTION,"are worth the effort they demand, because there is always a rational and"
229,INTRODUCTION,unesoteric solution to be gained.
230,INTRODUCTION,
231,INTRODUCTION,"The work as a whole has form, is shapely, even dramatic; but it is"
232,INTRODUCTION,"discontinuous and episodic in its conduct, and is most memorable in its"
233,INTRODUCTION,"separate parts. No one can forget the magnificent ""set pieces"" of Wolsey"
234,INTRODUCTION,and Charles XII; but hardly less noteworthy are the two parallel
235,INTRODUCTION,"invocations interspersed, the one addressed to the young scholar, the"
236,INTRODUCTION,"other to young beauties ""of rosy lips and radiant eyes"",--superb"
237,INTRODUCTION,"admonitions both, each containing such felicities of grave, compacted"
238,INTRODUCTION,"statement as will hardly be surpassed. The assuaging, marmoreal majesty of"
239,INTRODUCTION,the concluding lines of the poem are a final demonstration of the virtue
240,INTRODUCTION,"of this formal dignity in poetry. If it did not appear invidious, one"
241,INTRODUCTION,"would like to quote by way of contrast some lines oddly parallel, but on a"
242,INTRODUCTION,"pitch deliberately subdued to a less rhetorical level, from what is"
243,INTRODUCTION,"indubitably one of the very greatest poems written in our own century, Mr."
244,INTRODUCTION,Eliot's _Four Quartets_:
245,INTRODUCTION,
246,INTRODUCTION,"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope"
247,INTRODUCTION,For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love
248,INTRODUCTION,For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith
249,INTRODUCTION,But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.
250,INTRODUCTION,"Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:"
251,INTRODUCTION,"So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing."
252,INTRODUCTION,
253,INTRODUCTION,From _The Vanity of Human Wishes_:
254,INTRODUCTION,
255,INTRODUCTION,"Still raise for good the supplicating voice,"
256,INTRODUCTION,"But leave to heav'n the measure and the choice,"
257,INTRODUCTION,"Safe in his pow'r, whose eyes discern afar"
258,INTRODUCTION,The secret ambush of a specious pray'r.
259,INTRODUCTION,"Implore his aid, in his decisions rest,"
260,INTRODUCTION,"Secure whate'er he gives, he gives the best...."
261,INTRODUCTION,"Pour forth thy fervours for a healthful mind,"
262,INTRODUCTION,"Obedient passions, and a will resign'd;"
263,INTRODUCTION,"For love, which scarce collective man can fill;"
264,INTRODUCTION,For patience sov'reign o'er transmuted ill;
265,INTRODUCTION,"For faith, that panting for a happier seat,"
266,INTRODUCTION,Counts death kind Nature's signal of retreat:
267,INTRODUCTION,"These goods for man the laws of heav'n ordain,"
268,INTRODUCTION,"These goods he grants, who grants the pow'r to gain;"
269,INTRODUCTION,"With these celestial wisdom calms the mind,"
270,INTRODUCTION,And makes the happiness she does not find.

732,VIRG.,VIRG.
733,VIRG.,
734,VIRG.,
735,VIRG.,Every Man is sufficiently discontented with some Circumstances of his
736,VIRG.,"present State, to suffer his Imagination to range more or less in quest of"
737,VIRG.,"future Happiness, and to fix upon some Point of Time, in which he shall,"
738,VIRG.,"by the Removal of the Inconvenience which now perplexes him, or the"
739,VIRG.,"Acquisition of Advantage which he at present wants, find his Condition of"
740,VIRG.,Life very much improved.
741,VIRG.,
742,VIRG.,"When this Time, which is too often expected with great Impatience, at last"
743,VIRG.,"arrives, it generally comes without the Blessing for which it was desired;"
744,VIRG.,"but we solace ourselves with some new Prospect, and press forward again"
745,VIRG.,with equal Eagerness.
746,VIRG.,
747,VIRG.,"It is some Advantage to a Man, in whom this Temper prevails in any great"
748,VIRG.,"Degree, when he turns his Hopes upon Things wholly out of his own Power,"
749,VIRG.,"since he forbears then to precipitate his Affairs, for the Sake of the"
750,VIRG.,"great Event that is to complete his Felicity, and waits for the blissful"
751,VIRG.,"Hour, without neglecting such Measures as are necessary to be taken in the"
752,VIRG.,mean Time.
753,VIRG.,
754,VIRG.,"I have long known a Person of this Temper, who indulged his Dream of"
755,VIRG.,Happiness with less Hurt to himself than such chimerical Wishes commonly
756,VIRG.,"produce, and adjusted his Scheme with such Address, that his Hopes were in"
757,VIRG.,"full bloom three parts of the Year, and in the other part never wholly"
758,VIRG.,"blasted. Many, perhaps, would be desirous of learning by what Means he"
759,VIRG.,procured to himself such a cheap and lasting Satisfaction. It was gained
760,VIRG.,only by a constant Practice of referring the Removal of all his Uneasiness
761,VIRG.,"to the Coming of the next Spring. If his Affairs were disordered, he could"
762,VIRG.,"regulate them in the Spring; if a Regimen was prescribed him, the Spring"
763,VIRG.,"was the proper Time of pursuing it; if what he wanted was at a high Price,"
764,VIRG.,it would fall its Value in the Spring.
765,VIRG.,
766,VIRG.,"The Spring, indeed, did often come without any of these Effects; but he"
767,VIRG.,was always certain that the next would be more propitious; and was never
768,VIRG.,convinced that the present Spring would fail him until the Middle of
769,VIRG.,"Summer; for he always talked of the Spring as coming 'till it was past,"
770,VIRG.,"and when it was once past, every one agreed with him that it was coming."
771,VIRG.,
772,VIRG.,"By long Converse with this Man, I am, perhaps, in some Degree brought to"
773,VIRG.,feel the same immoderate Pleasure in the Contemplation of this delightful
774,VIRG.,"Season; but I have the Satisfaction of finding many, whom it can be no"
775,VIRG.,"Shame to resemble, infected with the same Enthusiasm; for there is, I"
776,VIRG.,"believe, scarce any Poet of Eminence, who has not left some Testimony of"
777,VIRG.,"his Fondness for the Flowers, the Zephyrs, and the Warblers of the Spring."
778,VIRG.,Nor has the most luxuriant Imagination been able to describe the Serenity
779,VIRG.,and Happiness of the golden Age otherwise than by giving a perpetual
780,VIRG.,"Spring, as the highest Reward of uncorrupted Innocence."
781,VIRG.,
782,VIRG.,"There is, indeed, something inexpressibly pleasing in the annual"
783,VIRG.,"Renovation of the World, and the new Display of the Treasures of Nature."
784,VIRG.,"The Cold and Darkness of Winter, with the naked Deformity of every Object"
785,VIRG.,"on which we turn our Eyes, makes us necessarily rejoice at the succeeding"
786,VIRG.,"Season, as well for what we have escaped, as for what we may enjoy; and"
787,VIRG.,"every budding Flower, which a warm Situation brings early to our View, is"
788,VIRG.,"considered by us as a Messenger, to inform us of the Approach of more"
789,VIRG.,joyous Days.
790,VIRG.,
791,VIRG.,"The Spring affords to a Mind, so free from the Disturbance of Cares or"
792,VIRG.,"Passions as to be vacant to calm Amusements, almost every Thing that our"
793,VIRG.,present State makes us capable of enjoying. The variegated Verdure of the
794,VIRG.,"Fields and Woods, the Succession of grateful Odours, the Voice of Pleasure"
795,VIRG.,"pouring out its Notes on every Side, with the Observation of the Gladness"
796,VIRG.,"apparently conceived by every Animal, from the Growth of his Food, and the"
797,VIRG.,"Clemency of the Weather, throw over the whole Earth an Air of Gayety,"
798,VIRG.,which is very significantly expressed by the Smile of Nature.
799,VIRG.,
800,VIRG.,"There are Men to whom these Scenes are able to give no Delight, and who"
801,VIRG.,"hurry away from all the Varieties of rural Beauty, to lose their Hours,"
802,VIRG.,"and divert their Thoughts by Cards, or publick Assemblies, a Tavern"
803,VIRG.,"Dinner, or the Prattle of the Day."
804,VIRG.,
805,VIRG.,"It may be laid down as a Position which will seldom deceive, that when a"
806,VIRG.,Man cannot bear his own Company there is something wrong. He must fly from
807,VIRG.,"himself, either because he feels a Tediousness in Life from the Equipoise"
808,VIRG.,"of an empty Mind, which, having no Tendency to one Motion more than"
809,VIRG.,"another but as it is impelled by some external Power, must always have"
810,VIRG.,recourse to foreign Objects; or he must be afraid of the Intrusion of some
811,VIRG.,"unpleasing Ideas, and, perhaps, is always struggling to escape from the"
812,VIRG.,"Remembrance of a Loss, the Fear of a Calamity, or some other Thought of"
813,VIRG.,greater Horror.
814,VIRG.,
815,VIRG.,"Those, who are incapacitated to enjoy the Pleasures of Contemplation, by"
816,VIRG.,"their Griefs, may, very properly, apply to such Diversions, provided they"
817,VIRG.,"are innocent, as lay strong hold on the Attention; and those, whom Fear of"
818,VIRG.,"any future Calamity chains down to Misery, must endeavour to obviate the"
819,VIRG.,Danger.
820,VIRG.,
821,VIRG.,"My Considerations shall, on this Occasion, be turned on such as are"
822,VIRG.,burthensome to themselves merely because they want Subjects for
823,VIRG.,"Reflection, and to whom the Volume of Nature is thrown open without"
824,VIRG.,"affording them Pleasure or Instruction, because they never learned to read"
825,VIRG.,the Characters.
826,VIRG.,
827,VIRG.,"A French Author has advanced this seeming Paradox, that _very few Men know"
828,VIRG.,"how to take a Walk_; and, indeed, it is very true, that few Men know how"
829,VIRG.,"to take a Walk with a Prospect of any other Pleasure, than the same"
830,VIRG.,Company would have afforded them in any other Circumstances.
831,VIRG.,
832,VIRG.,"There are Animals that borrow their Colour from the neighbouring Body,"
833,VIRG.,"and, consequently, vary their Hue as they happen to change their Place. In"
834,VIRG.,like manner it ought to be the Endeavour of every Man to derive his
835,VIRG.,Reflexions from the Objects about him; for it is to no purpose that he
836,VIRG.,"alters his Position, if his Attention continues fixt to the same Point."
837,VIRG.,"The Mind should be kept open to the Access of every new Idea, and so far"
838,VIRG.,"disengaged from the Predominance of particular Thoughts, as to be able to"
839,VIRG.,"accommodate itself to emergent Occasions, and remark every Thing that"
840,VIRG.,offers itself to present Examination.
841,VIRG.,
842,VIRG.,A Man that has formed this Habit of turning every new Object to his
843,VIRG.,"Entertainment, finds in the Productions of Nature an inexhaustible Stock"
844,VIRG.,"of Materials, upon which he can employ himself, without any Temptations to"
845,VIRG.,"Envy or Malevolence; Faults, perhaps, seldom totally avoided by those,"
846,VIRG.,whose Judgment is much exercised upon the Works of Art. He has always a
847,VIRG.,certain Prospect of discovering new Reasons for adoring the Sovereign
848,VIRG.,"Author of the Universe, and probable Hopes of making some Discovery of"
849,VIRG.,"Benefit to others, or of Profit to himself. There is no doubt but many"
850,VIRG.,Vegetables and Animals have Qualities that might be of great Use; to the
851,VIRG.,"Knowledge of which there is required no great Sagacity of Penetration, or"
852,VIRG.,"Fatigue of Study, but only frequent Experiments, and close Attention. What"
853,VIRG.,"is said by the Chymists of their darling Mercury, is, perhaps, true of"
854,VIRG.,"every Body through the whole Creation, that, if a thousand Lives should be"
855,VIRG.,"spent upon it, all its Properties would not be found out."
856,VIRG.,
857,VIRG.,"Mankind must necessarily be diversified by various Tastes, since Life"
858,VIRG.,affords and requires such multiplicity of Employments; and a Nation of
859,VIRG.,"Naturalists is neither to be hoped, or desired, but it is surely not"
860,VIRG.,"improper to point out a fresh Amusement to those who langush in Health,"
861,VIRG.,"and repine in Plenty, for want of some Source of Diversion that may be"
862,VIRG.,"less easily exhausted, and to inform the Multitudes of both Sexes, who are"
863,VIRG.,"burthened with every new Day, that there are many Shews which they have"
864,VIRG.,not seen.
865,VIRG.,
866,VIRG.,"He that enlarges his Curiosity after the Works of Nature, demonstrably"
867,VIRG.,"multiplies the Inlets to Happiness, and, therefore, the younger Part of my"
868,VIRG.,"Readers, to whom I dedicate this vernal Speculation, must excuse me for"
869,VIRG.,"calling upon them to make use at once of the Spring of the Year, and the"
870,VIRG.,"Spring of Life; to acquire, while their Minds may be yet impressed with"
871,VIRG.,"new Images, a Love of innocent Pleasures, and an ardour for useful"
872,VIRG.,"Knowledge; and to remember, that a blighted Spring makes a barren Year,"
873,VIRG.,"and that the vernal Flowers, however beautiful and gay, are only intended"
874,VIRG.,by Nature as Preparatives to Autumnal Fruits.

896,THE RAMBLER.,
897,THE RAMBLER.,
898,THE RAMBLER.,All Joy or Sorrow for the Happiness or Calamities of others is produced by
899,THE RAMBLER.,"an Act of the Imagination, that realises the Event however fictitious, or"
900,THE RAMBLER.,"approximates it however remote, by placing us, for a Time, in the"
901,THE RAMBLER.,"Condition of him whose Fortune we contemplate; so that we feel, while the"
902,THE RAMBLER.,"Deception lasts, whatever Motions would be excited by the same Good or"
903,THE RAMBLER.,Evil happening to ourselves.
904,THE RAMBLER.,
905,THE RAMBLER.,"Our Passions are therefore more strongly moved, in proportion as we can"
906,THE RAMBLER.,"more readily adopt the Pains or Pleasures proposed to our Minds, by"
907,THE RAMBLER.,"recognising them as once our own, or considering them as naturally"
908,THE RAMBLER.,incident to our State of Life. It is not easy for the most artful Writer
909,THE RAMBLER.,"to give us an Interest in Happiness or Misery, which we think ourselves"
910,THE RAMBLER.,"never likely to feel, and with which we have never yet been made"
911,THE RAMBLER.,"acquainted. Histories of the Downfall of Kingdoms, and Revolutions of"
912,THE RAMBLER.,Empires are read with great Tranquillity; the imperial Tragedy pleases
913,THE RAMBLER.,"common Auditors only by its Pomp of Ornament, and Grandeur of Ideas; and"
914,THE RAMBLER.,"the Man whose Faculties have been engrossed by Business, and whose Heart"
915,THE RAMBLER.,"never fluttered but at the Rise or Fall of Stocks, wonders how the"
916,THE RAMBLER.,"Attention can be seized, or the Affections agitated by a Tale of Love."
917,THE RAMBLER.,
918,THE RAMBLER.,"Those parallel Circumstances, and kindred Images to which we readily"
919,THE RAMBLER.,"conform our Minds, are, above all other Writings, to be found in"
920,THE RAMBLER.,Narratives of the Lives of particular Persons; and there seems therefore
921,THE RAMBLER.,"no Species of Writing more worthy of Cultivation than Biography, since"
922,THE RAMBLER.,"none can be more delightful, or more useful, none can more certainly"
923,THE RAMBLER.,"enchain the Heart by irresistible Interest, or more widely diffuse"
924,THE RAMBLER.,Instruction to every Diversity of Condition.
925,THE RAMBLER.,
926,THE RAMBLER.,"The general and rapid Narratives of History, which involve a thousand"
927,THE RAMBLER.,"Fortunes in the Business of a Day, and complicate innumerable Incidents in"
928,THE RAMBLER.,"one great Transaction, afford few Lessons applicable to private Life,"
929,THE RAMBLER.,which derives its Comforts and its Wretchedness from the right or wrong
930,THE RAMBLER.,"Management of Things that nothing but their Frequency makes considerable,"
931,THE RAMBLER.,"_Parva si non fiunt quotidie_, says _Pliny_, and which can have no Place"
932,THE RAMBLER.,"in those Relations which never descend below the Consultation of Senates,"
933,THE RAMBLER.,"the Motions of Armies, and the Schemes of Conspirators."
934,THE RAMBLER.,
935,THE RAMBLER.,I have often thought that there has rarely passed a Life of which a
936,THE RAMBLER.,"judicious and faithful Narrative would not be useful. For, not only every"
937,THE RAMBLER.,Man has in the mighty Mass of the World great Numbers in the same
938,THE RAMBLER.,"Condition with himself, to whom his Mistakes and Miscarriages, Escapes and"
939,THE RAMBLER.,Expedients would be of immediate and apparent Use; but there is such an
940,THE RAMBLER.,"Uniformity in the Life of Man, if it be considered apart from adventitious"
941,THE RAMBLER.,"and separable Decorations and Disguises, that there is scarce any"
942,THE RAMBLER.,"Possibility of Good or Ill, but is common to Humankind. A great Part of"
943,THE RAMBLER.,"the Time of those who are placed at the greatest Distance by Fortune, or"
944,THE RAMBLER.,"by Temper, must unavoidably pass in the same Manner; and though, when the"
945,THE RAMBLER.,"Claims of Nature are satisfied, Caprice, and Vanity, and Accident, begin"
946,THE RAMBLER.,"to produce Discriminations, and Peculiarities, yet the Eye is not very"
947,THE RAMBLER.,"heedful, or quick, which cannot discover the same Causes still terminating"
948,THE RAMBLER.,"their Influence in the same Effects, though sometimes accelerated,"
949,THE RAMBLER.,"sometimes retarded, or perplexed by multiplied Combinations. We are all"
950,THE RAMBLER.,"prompted by the same Motives, all deceived by the same Fallacies, all"
951,THE RAMBLER.,"animated by Hope, obstructed by Danger, entangled by Desire, and seduced"
952,THE RAMBLER.,by Pleasure.
953,THE RAMBLER.,
954,THE RAMBLER.,"It is frequently objected to Relations of particular Lives, that they are"
955,THE RAMBLER.,not distinguished by any striking or wonderful Vicissitude. The Scholar
956,THE RAMBLER.,"who passes his Life among his Books, the Merchant who conducted only his"
957,THE RAMBLER.,"own Affairs, the Priest whose Sphere of Action was not extended beyond"
958,THE RAMBLER.,"that of his Duty, are considered as no proper Objects of publick Regard,"
959,THE RAMBLER.,"however they might have excelled in their several Stations, whatever might"
960,THE RAMBLER.,"have been their Learning, Integrity, and Piety. But this Notion arises"
961,THE RAMBLER.,"from false Measures of Excellence and Dignity, and must be eradicated by"
962,THE RAMBLER.,"considering, that, in the Eye of uncorrupted Reason, what is of most Use"
963,THE RAMBLER.,is of most Value.
964,THE RAMBLER.,
965,THE RAMBLER.,"It is, indeed, not improper to take honest Advantages of Prejudice, and to"
966,THE RAMBLER.,gain Attention by a great Name; but the Business of the Biographer is
967,THE RAMBLER.,"often to pass slightly over those Performances and Incidents, which"
968,THE RAMBLER.,"produce vulgar Greatness, to lead the Thoughts into domestick Privacies,"
969,THE RAMBLER.,"and display the minute Details of daily Life, where exterior Appendages"
970,THE RAMBLER.,"are cast aside, and Men excel each other only by Prudence, and by Virtue."
971,THE RAMBLER.,"The Life of _Thuanus_ is, with great Propriety, said by its Author to have"
972,THE RAMBLER.,"been written, that it might lay open to Posterity the private and familiar"
973,THE RAMBLER.,"Character of that Man, _cujus Ingenium et Candorem ex ipsius Scriptis sunt"
974,THE RAMBLER.,"olim simper miraturi_, whose Candour and Genius his Writings will to the"
975,THE RAMBLER.,End of Time preserve in Admiration.
976,THE RAMBLER.,
977,THE RAMBLER.,"There are many invisible Circumstances, which whether we read as Enquirers"
978,THE RAMBLER.,"after natural or moral Knowledge, whether we intend to enlarge our"
979,THE RAMBLER.,"Science, or encrease our Virtue, are more important than publick"
980,THE RAMBLER.,"Occurrences. Thus _Salust_, the great Master, has not forgot, in his"
981,THE RAMBLER.,"Account of _Catiline_, to remark that _his Walk was now quick, and again"
982,THE RAMBLER.,"slow_, as an Indication of a Mind revolving something with violent"
983,THE RAMBLER.,Commotion. Thus the Story of _Melancthon_ affords a striking Lecture on
984,THE RAMBLER.,"the Value of Time, by informing us that when he made an Appointment, he"
985,THE RAMBLER.,"expected not only the Hour, but the Minute to be fixed, that Life might"
986,THE RAMBLER.,not run out in the Idleness of Suspense; and all the Plans and Enterprizes
987,THE RAMBLER.,"of _De Wit_ are now of less Importance to the World, than that Part of his"
988,THE RAMBLER.,"personal Character which represents him as careful of his Health, and"
989,THE RAMBLER.,negligent of his Life.
990,THE RAMBLER.,
991,THE RAMBLER.,But Biography has often been allotted to Writers who seem very little
992,THE RAMBLER.,"acquainted with the Nature of their Task, or very negligent about the"
993,THE RAMBLER.,Performance. They rarely afford any other Account than might be collected
994,THE RAMBLER.,"from publick Papers, and imagine themselves writing a Life when they"
995,THE RAMBLER.,exhibit a chronological Series of Actions or Preferments; and so little
996,THE RAMBLER.,"regard the Manners or Behaviour of their Heroes, that more Knowledge may"
997,THE RAMBLER.,"be gained of a Man's real Character, by a short Conversation with one of"
998,THE RAMBLER.,"his Servants, than from a formal and studied Narrative, begun with his"
999,THE RAMBLER.,"Pedigree, and ended with his Funeral."
1000,THE RAMBLER.,
1001,THE RAMBLER.,"If now and then they condescend to inform the World of particular Facts,"
1002,THE RAMBLER.,they are not always so happy as to select those which are of most
1003,THE RAMBLER.,Importance. I know not well what Advantage Posterity can receive from the
1004,THE RAMBLER.,only Circumstance by which _Tickell_ has distinguished _Addison_ from the
1005,THE RAMBLER.,"Rest of Mankind, the Irregularity of his Pulse: nor can I think myself"
1006,THE RAMBLER.,"overpaid for the Time spent in reading the Life of _Malherb_, by being"
1007,THE RAMBLER.,"enabled to relate, after the learned Biographer, that _Malherb_ had two"
1008,THE RAMBLER.,"predominant Opinions; one, that the Looseness of a single Woman might"
1009,THE RAMBLER.,"destroy all the Boast of ancient Descent; the other, that the _French_"
1010,THE RAMBLER.,Beggers made use very improperly and barbarously of the Phrase _noble
1011,THE RAMBLER.,"Gentleman_, because either Word included the Sense of both."
1012,THE RAMBLER.,
1013,THE RAMBLER.,"There are, indeed, some natural Reasons why these Narratives are often"
1014,THE RAMBLER.,"written by such as were not likely to give much Instruction or Delight,"
1015,THE RAMBLER.,and why most Accounts of particular Persons are barren and useless. If a
1016,THE RAMBLER.,"Life be delayed till all Interest and Envy are at an End, and all Motives"
1017,THE RAMBLER.,"to Calumny or Flattery are suppressed, we may hope for Impartiality, but"
1018,THE RAMBLER.,must expect little Intelligence; for the Incidents which give Excellence
1019,THE RAMBLER.,"to Biography are of a volatile and evanescent Kind, such as soon escape"
1020,THE RAMBLER.,"the Memory, and are rarely transmitted by Tradition. We know how few can"
1021,THE RAMBLER.,"portray a living Acquaintance, except by his most prominent and observable"
1022,THE RAMBLER.,"Particularities, and the grosser Features of his Mind; and it may be"
1023,THE RAMBLER.,easily imagined how much of this little Knowledge may be lost in imparting
1024,THE RAMBLER.,"it, and how soon a Succession of Copies will lose all Resemblance of the"
1025,THE RAMBLER.,Original.
1026,THE RAMBLER.,
1027,THE RAMBLER.,"If the Biographer writes from personal Knowledge, and makes haste to"
1028,THE RAMBLER.,"gratify the publick Curiosity, there is Danger left his Interest, his"
1029,THE RAMBLER.,"Fear, his Gratitude, or his Tenderness, overpower his Fidelity, and tempt"
1030,THE RAMBLER.,"him to conceal, if not to invent. There are many who think it an Act of"
1031,THE RAMBLER.,"Piety to hide the Faults or Failings of their Friends, even when they can"
1032,THE RAMBLER.,no longer suffer by their Detection; we therefore see whole Ranks of
1033,THE RAMBLER.,"Characters adorned with uniform Panegyrick, and not to be known from one"
1034,THE RAMBLER.,"another, but by extrinsick and casual Circumstances. ""Let me remember,"
1035,THE RAMBLER.,"says _Hale_, when I find myself inclined to pity a Criminal, that there is"
1036,THE RAMBLER.,"likewise a Pity due to the Country."" If there is a Regard due to the"
1037,THE RAMBLER.,"Memory of the Dead, there is yet more Respect to be paid to Knowledge, to"
1038,THE RAMBLER.,"Virtue, and to Truth."
