137,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,
138,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,
139,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,
140,RAMUND,RAMUND
141,RAMUND,
142,RAMUND,
143,RAMUND,Ramund thought he should a better man be
144,RAMUND,If better apparel arrayed him;
145,RAMUND,"Of garments of leather, and hemp patch'd together,"
146,RAMUND,The Queen then a present made him.
147,RAMUND,"""These I will not wear,"" bold Ramund he said,"
148,RAMUND,"""They beseem me not fair,"" said Ramund the young."
149,RAMUND,
150,RAMUND,"""Your garments of tow and leather bestow"
151,RAMUND,"On the cleaners of trencher and platter."""
152,RAMUND,"The Lady to give him fresh clothes was not slow,"
153,RAMUND,And of sammet and silk were the latter.
154,RAMUND,"""Yes, these will I wear,"" bold Ramund he said,"
155,RAMUND,"""They beseem me right fair,"" said Ramund the young."
156,RAMUND,
157,RAMUND,"Ramund he into the shop now hies,"
158,RAMUND,Where the best of all tailors was sitting:
159,RAMUND,"""Now wilt thou, O tailor, so dext'rous and wise,"
160,RAMUND,"Make clothes for Ramund fitting?"""
161,RAMUND,"""And why should I not?"" the tailor he said,"
162,RAMUND,"""Then thou'lt do well I wot,"" said Ramund the young."
163,RAMUND,
164,RAMUND,"""Twice twenty-five ells for the breeches take,"
165,RAMUND,Fifteen for the points of the breeches;
166,RAMUND,And them thou must strong and durable make
167,RAMUND,"If thou therein settest stitches."""
168,RAMUND,"""These are too tight,"" bold Ramund he said,"
169,RAMUND,"""I can't stride out aright,"" said Ramund the young."
170,RAMUND,
171,RAMUND,Now Ramund his ships beside the shore
172,RAMUND,With everything needful prepareth;
173,RAMUND,"And away, away, the salt ocean o'er"
174,RAMUND,To the land of the Jutuns he beareth.
175,RAMUND,"""We are come to this soil,"" bold Ramund he said,"
176,RAMUND,"""And withouten much toil,"" said Ramund the young."
177,RAMUND,
178,RAMUND,"Ramund he wanders along the strand,"
179,RAMUND,There seven tall Giants faced him:
180,RAMUND,"""If I take Ramund in my left hand"
181,RAMUND,"I afar from the land will cast him."""
182,RAMUND,"""You'll not do that alone,"" bold Ramund he said,"
183,RAMUND,"""Ye must come every one,"" said Ramund the young."
184,RAMUND,
185,RAMUND,"Ramund drew out his trusty glaive,"
186,RAMUND,To which Dymling for name he had given;
187,RAMUND,And dead to the earth with seven blows brave
188,RAMUND,He hewed the Jotuns seven.
189,RAMUND,"""There ye all seven lie,"" bold Ramund he said,"
190,RAMUND,"""And still living am I,"" said Ramund the young."
191,RAMUND,
192,RAMUND,"Ramund walked on till the big Jutt he spied,"
193,RAMUND,And to see him he sorely wonder'd;
194,RAMUND,"For full fifty ells was his carcase wide,"
195,RAMUND,And his height was nearly a hundred.
196,RAMUND,"""What a breadth, what a height!"" bold Ramund he said,"
197,RAMUND,"""Dost wish for a fight?"" said Ramund the young."
198,RAMUND,
199,RAMUND,"""Dear Ramund, if thou wilt let me live,"
200,RAMUND,"And to me no damage wilt proffer,"
201,RAMUND,"I'll bathe thee in wine, and to thee I will give"
202,RAMUND,"Seven bushels of gold from my coffer."""
203,RAMUND,"""Make 'em eight, if you will,"" bold Ramund he said,"
204,RAMUND,"""I will cut thee down still,"" said Ramund the young."
205,RAMUND,
206,RAMUND,"The first, first day that together they fought"
207,RAMUND,With their naked fists they contested;
208,RAMUND,Then Ramund he hold of the Jutt's beard caught
209,RAMUND,And the flesh from the teeth he wrested.
210,RAMUND,"""Thou grinnest full evil, bold Ramund,"" he said,"
211,RAMUND,"""Thou look'st worse than the Devil,"" said Ramund the young."
212,RAMUND,
213,RAMUND,"Next day they set to at the rise of the sun,"
214,RAMUND,Again with a rage unexampled;
215,RAMUND,The huge stone mountain they stood upon
216,RAMUND,To the earth 'neath their feet was trampled.
217,RAMUND,"""'Tis hard sport, I swear!"" the giant he said,"
218,RAMUND,"""We began but this year,"" said Ramund the young."
219,RAMUND,
220,RAMUND,"Then Ramund again to his sword recurred,"
221,RAMUND,To which Dymling for name he had given;
222,RAMUND,"And the head of the Jutt, which no ox could have stirred,"
223,RAMUND,He hewed high unto the heaven.
224,RAMUND,"""'Twould not cut well I thought,"" bold Ramund he said"
225,RAMUND,"""Yet it cut as it ought,"" said Ramund the young."
226,RAMUND,
227,RAMUND,"Ramund he into the mountain strode,"
228,RAMUND,Where the small trolds house were keeping;
229,RAMUND,"The tears fast down their visages flow'd,"
230,RAMUND,For Ramund they fell to weeping.
231,RAMUND,"""Do ye weep for me,"" bold Ramund he said,"
232,RAMUND,"""I'll ne'er weep for ye,"" said Ramund the young."
233,RAMUND,
234,RAMUND,Now Ramund behold is dealing his blows
235,RAMUND,Like the Kemps most famed for fighting;
236,RAMUND,About and around in the cave he goes
237,RAMUND,To the earth the demons smiting.
238,RAMUND,"""I rule here at my ease,"" bold Ramund he said,"
239,RAMUND,"""And can do what I please,"" said Ramund the young."
240,RAMUND,
241,RAMUND,On his ship entered he so vehemently
242,RAMUND,That it cracked his vehemence under;
243,RAMUND,In the ship the men all began loudly to bawl
244,RAMUND,And thought they should certainly founder.
245,RAMUND,"""We shall not sink here,"" bold Ramund he said,"
246,RAMUND,"""So ye need not to fear,"" said Ramund the young."
247,RAMUND,
248,RAMUND,Now Ramund he straight seven ships did freight
249,RAMUND,With the gold which the Trolds had hoarded;
250,RAMUND,Then across the tide to the land he hied
251,RAMUND,O'er which the Emperor lorded.
252,RAMUND,"""To this land we are come,"" bold Ramund he said,"
253,RAMUND,"""We no farther will roam,"" said Ramund the young."
254,RAMUND,
255,RAMUND,"On the white sand Ramund his anchor flung,"
256,RAMUND,The high prow strandward turning;
257,RAMUND,And the very first man to land that sprung
258,RAMUND,"Was himself, with eagerness burning."
259,RAMUND,"""Now do nothing more,"" bold Ramund he said,"
260,RAMUND,"""All labour give o'er,"" said Ramund the young."
261,RAMUND,
262,RAMUND,"To the Ball-house he sped, where the kempions play'd"
263,RAMUND,At ball with glee and vigour;
264,RAMUND,"But at his coming all stood adread,"
265,RAMUND,At the sight of so fierce a figure.
266,RAMUND,"""Pretty sport is this same,"" bold Ramund he said,"
267,RAMUND,"""I'll make one in the game,"" said Ramund the young."
268,RAMUND,
269,RAMUND,With fear and dismay upon his brow
270,RAMUND,From a window the Emperor gazes:
271,RAMUND,"""O who is that man in the yard below"
272,RAMUND,"That makes such horrible faces?"""
273,RAMUND,"""'Tis I, and with glee,"" bold Ramund he said,"
274,RAMUND,"""I'll do battle with thee,"" said Ramund the young."
275,RAMUND,
276,RAMUND,"Ramund he struck on his sword amain,"
277,RAMUND,The earth to its centre trembled;
278,RAMUND,"The small birds swooned and fell on the plain,"
279,RAMUND,On the bough that were singing assembled.
280,RAMUND,"""Come down to me, knave,"" bold Ramund he said,"
281,RAMUND,"""Or by God I shall rave,"" said Ramund the young."
282,RAMUND,
283,RAMUND,"Ramund he into the door now trode,"
284,RAMUND,His face like a burning ember:
285,RAMUND,"""Though iron and steel oppose my road"
286,RAMUND,"I'll penetrate to his chamber."""
287,RAMUND,"""Now be on thy guard,"" bold Ramund he said,"
288,RAMUND,"""I'm about to strike hard,"" said Ramund the young."
289,RAMUND,
290,RAMUND,"On the door Ramund smote with an iron bar stout,"
291,RAMUND,The castle was rent and parted;
292,RAMUND,"'Neath that blow's power nod wall and tower,"
293,RAMUND,From their place the windows started.
294,RAMUND,"""You see I broke in,"" bold Ramund he said,"
295,RAMUND,"""Now at stake is thy skin,"" said Ramund the young."
296,RAMUND,
297,RAMUND,"""Dear Ramund, dear Ramund, my life now spare,"
298,RAMUND,And with benefits thee I'll cover;
299,RAMUND,"I'll give thee my youngest daughter fair,"
300,RAMUND,"And the half of the land I rule over."""
301,RAMUND,"""Can take all any tide,"" bold Ramund he said,"
302,RAMUND,"""And thy daughter beside,"" said Ramund the young."
303,RAMUND,
304,RAMUND,"Ramund then drew out Dymling his blade,"
305,RAMUND,Of his valour the trusty assistant;
306,RAMUND,And he hewed at the Emperor so that his head
307,RAMUND,Flew fifteen furlongs distant.
308,RAMUND,"""I thought 'twould not sever,"" bold Ramund he said,"
309,RAMUND,"""But the blood runs however,"" said Ramund the young."

315,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
316,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
317,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Alf he dwells at Odderskier,"
318,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Is rich and bold withal;
319,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Two stout and stalwart sons has he
320,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Whom men do kempions call.
321,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
322,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Yes, two stout sons of mighty fame"
323,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Has Alf of Odderskier;
324,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Of the king who dwells on Upsal fells
325,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,They love the daughter fair.
326,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
327,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"It was youthful Helmer Kamp,"
328,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,From stall his courser led;
329,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""O I will hie me up the land"
330,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"And the king's fair daughter wed."""
331,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
332,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,It was youthful Angelfyr
333,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,He sprang on his courser's back:
334,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""And I will ride to Upsal too,"
335,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Though the earth beneath me crack."""
336,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
337,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,And when they entered the castle yard
338,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,They doffed their cloaks of skin;
339,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then straight they strode to the high, high hall,"
340,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,To the monarch of Upsal in.
341,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
342,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"In came youthful Helmer Kamp,"
343,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,With grace and beauty rife:
344,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""O King, thy daughter dear I love,"
345,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Wilt give her me for wife?"""
346,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
347,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"In came youthful Angelfyr,"
348,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,His steely helmet shone:
349,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""O King, give up thy daughter to me,"
350,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"And straight from the land begone."""
351,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
352,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then answered soon the Upsal-King,"
353,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,And a brave reply he gave:
354,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""On my daughter I'll no husband force,"
355,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"She'll choose whom she will have."""
356,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
357,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""Now many thanks, dear father, that"
358,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Thou leav'st the choice to me;
359,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"I'll plight me to young Helmer Kamp,"
360,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,He's like a man to see.
361,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
362,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""But I'll not have young Angelfyr,"
363,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,He's an ugly Trold to view;
364,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"His father so is, his mother so is,"
365,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"So are all his kindred too."""
366,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
367,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then answered the young Angelfyr,"
368,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,So sorely wroth he grew:
369,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""Come, brother, come to the court-yard down,"
370,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"For her we will battle do."""
371,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
372,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then up and spake the Upsal King,"
373,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,And the Upsal King did say:
374,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""The swords are sharp, the swains are stark,"
375,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"There'll be, I trow, good play."""
376,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
377,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Alf he stands at Odderskier,"
378,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,And he listens the mountains tow'rds;
379,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then must he hear so far, far off"
380,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,The clash of his children's swords.
381,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
382,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"And that heard Alf of Odderskier,"
383,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,So far across the down:
384,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""What have my sons now got in hand?"
385,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Why so wrathful are they grown?"""
386,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
387,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"He tarried then so short a space,"
388,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,He sprang on his courser red;
389,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,And he arrived at Upsala
390,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Before his sons lay dead.
391,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
392,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""Now tell me, youthful Helmer Kamp,"
393,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Tell me my dearest son,"
394,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Wherefore so free from thy flesh and bone
395,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Those bloody rivers run?"""
396,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
397,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then answered the young Helmer Kamp,"
398,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,As he writhed him round with pain;
399,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"This Angelfyr, my brother, has done"
400,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Since the maid he could not gain.
401,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
402,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"I have full fifteen mortal wounds,"
403,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,They are blent with poison all;
404,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"But if I had only one of them,"
405,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"I dead full soon must fall."""
406,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,
407,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""Now list to me, young Angelfyr,"
408,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,Beloved son of mine;
409,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Say, wherefore trembles so the sword,"
410,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"In that good hand of thine?"""
