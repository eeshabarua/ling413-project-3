25,,"We may live without poetry, music, and art;"
26,,We may live without conscience and live without heart;
27,,We may live without friends; we may live without books;
28,,But civilized man cannot live without _cooks_.
29,,He may live without books--what is knowledge but grieving?
30,,He may live without hope--what is hope but deceiving?
31,,He may live without love--what is passion but pining?
32,,But where is the man who can live without _dining_?

122,TO THE READER.,
123,TO THE READER.,
124,TO THE READER.,"Though cooks are often men of pregnant wit,"
125,TO THE READER.,Through niceness of their subject few have writ.
126,TO THE READER.,"'Tis a sage question, if the art of cooks"
127,TO THE READER.,Is lodg'd by nature or attain'd by books?
128,TO THE READER.,"That man will never frame a noble treat,"
129,TO THE READER.,Whose whole dependence lies in some _receipt_.
130,TO THE READER.,"Then by pure nature everything is spoil'd,--"
131,TO THE READER.,"She knows no more than stew'd, bak'd, roast, and boil'd."
132,TO THE READER.,"When art and nature join, the effect will be,"
133,TO THE READER.,"Some nice _ragout_, or _charming fricasee_."
134,TO THE READER.,"What earth and waters breed, or air inspires,"
135,TO THE READER.,Man for his palate fits by torturing fires.
136,TO THE READER.,"But, though my edge be not too nicely set,"
137,TO THE READER.,Yet I another's appetite may whet;
138,TO THE READER.,"May teach him when to buy, when season's pass'd,"
139,TO THE READER.,"What's stale, what choice, what plentiful, what waste,"
140,TO THE READER.,And lead him through the various maze of taste.
141,TO THE READER.,The fundamental principle of all
142,TO THE READER.,Is what ingenious cooks the _relish_ call;
143,TO THE READER.,"For when the market sends in loads of food,"
144,TO THE READER.,They all are tasteless till _that_ makes them good.
145,TO THE READER.,"Besides, 'tis no ignoble piece of care,"
146,TO THE READER.,To know for whom it is you would prepare.
147,TO THE READER.,"You'd please a friend, or reconcile a brother,"
148,TO THE READER.,"A testy father, or a haughty mother;"
149,TO THE READER.,"Would mollify a judge, would cram a squire,"
150,TO THE READER.,Or else some smiles from court you would desire;
151,TO THE READER.,"Or would, perhaps, some hasty supper give,"
152,TO THE READER.,To show the splendid state in which you live.
153,TO THE READER.,"Pursuant to that interest you propose,"
154,TO THE READER.,Must all your wines and all your meat be chose.
155,TO THE READER.,"Tables should be like pictures to the sight,"
156,TO THE READER.,"Some dishes cast in shade, some spread in light;"
157,TO THE READER.,"Some at a distance brighten, some near hand,"
158,TO THE READER.,Where ease may all their delicace command;
159,TO THE READER.,"Some should be moved when broken, others last"
160,TO THE READER.,"Through the whole treat, incentive to the taste."
161,TO THE READER.,"Locket, by many labors feeble grown,"
162,TO THE READER.,Up from the kitchen call'd his eldest son;
163,TO THE READER.,"Though wise thyself (says he), though taught by me,"
164,TO THE READER.,Yet fix this sentence in thy memory:
165,TO THE READER.,"There are some certain things that don't excel,"
166,TO THE READER.,And yet we say are tolerably well.
167,TO THE READER.,"There's many worthy men a lawyer prize,"
168,TO THE READER.,"Whom they distinguish as of middle size,"
169,TO THE READER.,For pleading well at bar or turning books;
170,TO THE READER.,"But this is not, my son, the fate of cooks,"
171,TO THE READER.,"From whose mysterious art true pleasure springs,"
172,TO THE READER.,"To stall of garters, and to throne of kings."
173,TO THE READER.,"A simple scene, a disobliging song,"
174,TO THE READER.,"Which no way to the main design belong,"
175,TO THE READER.,"Or were they absent never would be miss'd,"
176,TO THE READER.,Have made a well-wrought comedy be hiss'd;
177,TO THE READER.,"So in a feast, no intermediate fault"
178,TO THE READER.,"Will be allow'd; but if not best, 'tis nought."
179,TO THE READER.,"If you, perhaps, would try some dish unknown,"
180,TO THE READER.,"Which more peculiarly you'd make your own,"
181,TO THE READER.,"Like ancient sailors, still regard the coast,--"
182,TO THE READER.,By venturing out too far you may be lost.
183,TO THE READER.,"By roasting that which your forefathers boil'd,"
184,TO THE READER.,"And broiling what they roasted, much is spoil'd."
185,TO THE READER.,"That cook to American palates is complete,"
186,TO THE READER.,Whose savory hand gives turn to common meat.
187,TO THE READER.,"Far from your parlor have your kitchen placed,"
188,TO THE READER.,Dainties may in their working be disgraced.
189,TO THE READER.,"In private draw your poultry, clean your tripe,"
190,TO THE READER.,And from your eels their slimy substance wipe.
191,TO THE READER.,"Let cruel offices be done by night,"
192,TO THE READER.,For they who like the thing abhor the sight.
193,TO THE READER.,'Tis by his cleanliness a cook must please;
194,TO THE READER.,A kitchen will admit of no disease.
195,TO THE READER.,"Were Horace, that great master, now alive,"
196,TO THE READER.,"A feast with wit and judgment he'd contrive,"
197,TO THE READER.,As thus: Supposing that you would rehearse
198,TO THE READER.,"A labor'd work, and every dish a verse,"
199,TO THE READER.,"He'd say, ""Mend this and t'other line and this."""
200,TO THE READER.,"If after trial it were still amiss,"
201,TO THE READER.,"He'd bid you give it a new turn of face,"
202,TO THE READER.,Or set some dish more curious in its place.
203,TO THE READER.,"If you persist, he would not strive to move"
204,TO THE READER.,A passion so delightful as self-love.
205,TO THE READER.,"Cooks garnish out some tables, some they fill,"
206,TO THE READER.,Or in a prudent mixture show their skill.
207,TO THE READER.,Clog not your constant meals; for dishes few
208,TO THE READER.,Increase the appetite when choice and new.
209,TO THE READER.,"E'en they who will extravagance profess,"
210,TO THE READER.,Have still an inward hatred for excess.
211,TO THE READER.,"Meat forced too much, untouch'd at table lies;"
212,TO THE READER.,"Few care for carving trifles in disguise,"
213,TO THE READER.,Or that fantastic dish some call _surprise_.
214,TO THE READER.,"When pleasures to the eye and palate meet,"
215,TO THE READER.,That cook has render'd his great work complete;
216,TO THE READER.,"His glory far, like _sirloin knighthood_[xi-1] flies"
217,TO THE READER.,"Immortal made, as _Kit-cat_ by his pies."
218,TO THE READER.,"Next, let discretion moderate your cost,"
219,TO THE READER.,"And when you treat, three courses be the most."
220,TO THE READER.,"Let never fresh machines your pastry try,"
221,TO THE READER.,"Unless grandees or magistrates are by,"
222,TO THE READER.,Then you may put _a dwarf into a pie_.[xi-2]
223,TO THE READER.,Crowd not your table; let your number be
224,TO THE READER.,"Not more than seven, and never less than three."
225,TO THE READER.,"'Tis the _dessert_ that graces all the feast,"
226,TO THE READER.,For an ill end disparages the rest.
227,TO THE READER.,"A thousand things well done, and one forgot,"
228,TO THE READER.,Defaces obligation by that blot.
229,TO THE READER.,Make your transparent sweetmeats truly nice
230,TO THE READER.,With Indian sugar and Arabian spice.
231,TO THE READER.,And let your various creams encircled be
232,TO THE READER.,With swelling fruit just ravish'd from the tree.
233,TO THE READER.,"The feast now done, discourses are renewed,"
234,TO THE READER.,And witty arguments with mirth pursued;
235,TO THE READER.,"The cheerful master, 'midst his jovial friends,"
236,TO THE READER.,His glass to their best wishes recommends.
237,TO THE READER.,The grace cup follows: To the President's health
238,TO THE READER.,"And to the country; Plenty, Peace, and Wealth!"
239,TO THE READER.,"Performing, then, the piety of grace,"
240,TO THE READER.,Each man that pleases reassumes his place;
241,TO THE READER.,"While at his gate, from such abundant store,"
242,TO THE READER.,He showers his godlike blessings on the poor.

267,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
268,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
269,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,The mistress of a family should always remember that the welfare and
270,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior, and,"
271,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"consequently, that nothing is too trifling for her notice, whereby waste"
272,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,may be avoided.
273,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
274,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,Many families have owed their prosperity full as much to the conduct and
275,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"propriety of female arrangement, as to the knowledge and activity of the"
276,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,father.
277,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
278,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness,--sugars of"
279,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"different qualities should be broken; currants washed, picked and dry in"
280,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"a jar; spice pounded, &c. Every article should be kept in that place"
281,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"best suited to it, as much waste may thereby be avoided. Vegetables"
282,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"will keep best on a stone floor if the air be excluded. Dried meats,"
283,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"hams, &c., the same. All sorts of seeds for puddings, rice, &c., should"
284,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"be close-covered, to preserve from insects. Flour should be kept in a"
285,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"cool, perfectly dry room, and the bag being tied should be changed"
286,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"upside down and back every week, and well shaken. Carrots, parsnips, and"
287,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"beet-roots should be kept in sand for winter use, and neither they nor"
288,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,potatoes be cleared from the earth. Store onions preserve best hung up
289,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"in a dry room. Straw to lay apples on should be quite dry, to prevent a"
290,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"musty taste. Tarragon gives the flavor of French cookery, and in high"
291,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,gravies should be added only a short time before serving.
292,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
293,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"Basil, savory, and knotted marjoram, or London thyme, to be used when"
294,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"herbs are ordered; but with discretion, as they are very pungent."
295,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
296,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,Celery seeds give the flavor of the plant to soups. Parsley should be
297,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"cut close to the stalks, and dried on tins in a very cool oven; it"
298,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"preserves its flavor and color, and is very useful in winter. Artichoke"
299,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"bottoms, which have been slowly dried, should be kept in paper bags, and"
300,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"truffles, lemon-peel, &c., in a very dry place, ticketed."
301,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
302,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,Pickles and sweetmeats should be preserved from air: where the former
303,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"are much used, small jars of each should be taken from the stock-jar, to"
304,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,prevent frequent opening.
305,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
306,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice should be pared first, to"
307,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"preserve the peel dry; some should be halved, and, when squeezed, the"
308,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"pulp cut out, and the outsides dried for grating."
309,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
310,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"If for boiling any liquid, the first way is best. When whites of eggs"
311,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"are used for jelly, or other purposes, contrive to have pudding,"
312,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"custards, &c., to employ the yolks also."
313,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
314,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"Gravies or soups put by, should be daily changed into fresh scalded"
315,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,pans.
316,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
317,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &c., be suffered to boil over,"
318,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,the strength is lost.
319,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
320,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"The cook should be charged to take care of jelly bags, tapes for the"
321,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"collared things, &c., which, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give"
322,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,an unpleasant flavor when next used.
323,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
324,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,Hard water spoils the color of vegetables; a pinch of pearlash or salt
325,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,of wormwood will prevent that effect.
326,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
327,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"When sirloins of beef, loins of veal or mutton come in, part of the suet"
328,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"may be cut off for puddings, or to clarify; dripping will baste"
329,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"everything as well as butter, fowls and game excepted; and for kitchen"
330,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,pies nothing else should be used.
331,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
332,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,Meat and vegetables that the frost has touched should be soaked in cold
333,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"water two or three hours before they are used, or more if much iced;"
334,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"when put into hot water, or to the fire until thawed, no heat will"
335,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,dress them properly.
336,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
337,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"Meat should be well examined when it comes in, in warm weather. In the"
338,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,height of the summer it is a very safe way to let meat that is to be
339,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"salted lie an hour in cold water; then wipe it perfectly dry, and have"
340,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"ready salt, and rub it thoroughly into every part, leaving a handful"
341,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"over it besides. Turn it every day and rub the pickle in, which will"
342,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,make it ready for the table in three or four days; if it is desired to
343,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"be very much corned, wrap it in a well-floured cloth, having rubbed it"
344,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,previously with salt. The latter method will corn fresh beef fit for
345,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,table the day it comes in; but it must be put into the pot when the
346,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,water boils.
347,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
348,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"If the weather permits, meat eats much better for hanging two or three"
349,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,days before it be salted.
350,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
351,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,The water in which meat has been boiled makes an excellent soup for the
352,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"poor, when vegetables, oatmeal, or peas are added, and should not be"
353,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"cleared from the fat. Roast beef bones, or shank bones of ham, make fine"
354,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"peas soup, and should be boiled with the peas the day before eaten, that"
355,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,the fat may be removed. The mistress of the house will find many great
356,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,advantages in visiting her larder daily before she orders the bill of
357,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"fare; she will see what things require dressing, and thereby guard"
358,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,against their being spoiled. Many articles may be redressed in a
359,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"different form from that in which they are first served, an improve the"
360,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,appearance of the table without increasing the expense.
361,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
362,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes farthest; cutting"
363,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"out most advantageously, and affording most nourishment."
364,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
365,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"Round of beef, fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, bear a higher price;"
366,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"but having more solid meat, deserve the preference. It is worth notice,"
367,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"however, that those joints which are inferior may be dressed as"
368,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"palatably, and being cheaper ought to be bought in turn; and when"
369,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"weighed with the prime pieces, the price of the latter is reduced."
370,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
371,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"In loins of meat, the long pipe which runs by the bone should be taken"
372,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"out, being apt to taint, as likewise the kernels of beef."
373,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
374,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,Rumps and aitch bones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers
375,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"give, and that part always taints: avoid purchasing such."
376,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
377,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"The shank bones of mutton should be saved, and after soaking and"
378,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"bruising may be added to give richness to gravies and soups, and they"
379,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,are particularly nourishing for the sick.
380,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
381,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"Calves' tongues, salted, make a more useful dish than when dressed with"
382,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"the brains, which may be served without."
383,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
384,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"Some people like neats' tongues cured with the root, in which case they"
385,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"look much larger; but should the contrary be approved, the root must be"
386,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"cut off close to the gullet, next to the tongue, but without taking away"
387,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"the fat under the tongue. The root must be soaked in salt and water, and"
388,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,extremely well cleaned before it be dressed; and the tongue laid in salt
389,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,for a night and day before pickled.
390,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
391,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"Great attention is requisite in salting meat, and in the country, where"
392,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"great quantities are cured, it is of still more importance. Beef and"
393,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"pork should be well sprinkled, and a few hours after hung to drain,"
394,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"before it be rubbed with the preserving salts; which mode, by cleansing"
395,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"the meat from the blood, tends to keep it from tasting strong; it should"

398,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"find it well to boil up the pickle, skim, and when cold pour it over"
399,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,meat that has been sprinkled and drained. In some families great loss is
400,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,sustained by the spoiling of meat. If meat is brought from a distance in
401,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"warm weather, the butcher should be charged to cover it close, and bring"
402,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,it early in the morning.

407,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"day, in the cook's apprehension, yet may be preserved two or three days"
408,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"if wanted, by the following method:"
409,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,
410,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"If birds (woodcocks and snipes excepted, which must not be drawn), draw"
411,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"them, pick and take out the crop, wash them in two or three waters, and"
412,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,rub them with a little salt. Have ready a large saucepan of boiling
413,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"water, put the birds in it, and let them remain five minutes, moving it,"
414,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"that it may go through them. When all are finished, hang them by the"
415,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"heads in a cold place; when drained, pepper the inside and necks; when"
416,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"to be roasted, wash, to take off the pepper. The most delicate birds,"
417,MISTRESS OF A FAMILY.,"even grouse, may be kept this way, if not putrid."

465,MOORE.,"more ease; let the turtle hang all night, in which time the blood will"

467,MOORE.,"stoves and plenty of hot water in readiness, take the turtle, lay it on"
468,MOORE.,"the table on its back, and with a strong pointed knife cut round the"
469,MOORE.,"under shell (which is the callipee),--there are joints at each end,"
470,MOORE.,"which must be carefully found,--gently separating it from the callipash"
471,MOORE.,(which is the upper shell); be careful that in cutting out the gut you
472,MOORE.,do not break the gall. When the callipee and the callipash are perfectly
473,MOORE.,"separated, take out that part of the gut that leads from the throat;"
474,MOORE.,"that with the hearts put into a basin of water by themselves, the other"
475,MOORE.,"interior part put away. Take the callipee, and cut off the meat which"
476,MOORE.,"adheres to it in four quarters, laying it on a clean dish. Take twenty"
477,MOORE.,"pounds of veal, chop it up, and set it in a large pot, as directed for"
478,MOORE.,"espagnoles, putting in the flesh of the turtle at the same time, with"
479,MOORE.,"all kinds of turtle herbs, carrots, onions, one pound and a half of lean"
480,MOORE.,"ham, peppercorns, salt, and a little spice, and two bay leaves, leaving"

482,MOORE.,"scalded off--and hearts in, half an hour before you fill it, with half"
483,MOORE.,"water, and half beef stock, then carefully skim it; put in a bunch of"
484,MOORE.,"parsley, and let it boil gently like consommé. While the turtle is"
485,MOORE.,"stewing, carefully scald the head, the callipee, and all that is soft of"
486,MOORE.,"the callipash, attentively observing to take off the smallest skin that"
487,MOORE.,may remain; put them with the gut into a large pot of water to boil till
488,MOORE.,"tender; when so, take them out and cut them in squares, putting them in"
489,MOORE.,a basin by themselves till wanted for the soup. The next thing is the
490,MOORE.,"thickening of the soup, which must be prepared in the same manner as"
491,MOORE.,"sauce tournée. The turtle being well done, take out the fins and hearts,"
492,MOORE.,and lay them on a dish; the whole of the liquor must pass through a
493,MOORE.,"sieve into a large pan; then with a ladle take off all the fat, put it"
494,MOORE.,"into a basin, then mix in the turtle liquor (a small quantity at a"
495,MOORE.,"time), with the thickening made the same as tournée; but it does not"
496,MOORE.,"require to, neither must it, be one-twentieth part as thick. Set it over"
497,MOORE.,"a brisk fire, and continue stirring till it boils. When it has boiled"
498,MOORE.,"gently for one hour put in the callipee and callipash with the guts,"
499,MOORE.,"hearts, and some of the best of the meat and head, all cut in squares,"
500,MOORE.,"with the forcemeat balls and herbs, which you should have ready chopped"

507,MOORE.,"take a basin, put a little cayenne into it, with the juice of six lemons"
508,MOORE.,"squeezed through a sieve. When the dinner is wanted, skim the turtle,"
