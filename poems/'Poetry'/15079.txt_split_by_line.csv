211,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.
212,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
213,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"I come upon it suddenly, alone--"
214,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,A little pathway winding in the weeds
215,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"That fringe the roadside; and with dreams my own,"
216,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,I wander as it leads.
217,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
218,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Full wistfully along the slender way,"
219,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Through summer tan of freckled shade and shine,"
220,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,I take the path that leads me as it may--
221,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Its every choice is mine.
222,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
223,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"A chipmunk, or a sudden-whirring quail,"
224,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Is startled by my step as on I fare--
225,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,A garter-snake across the dusty trail
226,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Glances and--is not there.
227,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
228,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Above the arching jimson-weeds flare twos
229,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And twos of sallow-yellow butterflies,"
230,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Like blooms of lorn primroses blowing loose
231,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,When autumn winds arise.
232,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
233,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"The trail dips--dwindles--broadens then, and lifts"
234,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Itself astride a cross-road dubiously,"
235,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And, from the fennel marge beyond it, drifts"
236,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Still onward, beckoning me."
237,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
238,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,And though it needs must lure me mile on mile
239,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Out of the public highway, still I go,"
240,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"My thoughts, far in advance in Indian-file,"
241,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Allure me even so.
242,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
243,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Why, I am as a long-lost boy that went"
244,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"At dusk to bring the cattle to the bars,"
245,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And was not found again, though Heaven lent"
246,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,His mother ail the stars
247,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
248,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,With which to seek him through that awful night.
249,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,O years of nights as vain!--Stars never rise
250,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,But well might miss their glitter in the light
251,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Of tears in mother-eyes!
252,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
253,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"So--on, with quickened breaths, I follow still--"
254,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,My _avant-courier_ must be obeyed!
255,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Thus am I led, and thus the path, at will,"
256,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Invites me to invade
257,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
258,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"A meadow's precincts, where my daring guide"
259,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Clambers the steps of an old-fashioned stile,"
260,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And stumbles down again, the other side,"
261,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,To gambol there awhile
262,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
263,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"In pranks of hide-and-seek, as on ahead"
264,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"I see it running, while the clover-stalks"
265,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Shake rosy fists at me, as though they said--"
266,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"""You dog our country-walks"
267,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
268,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,And mutilate us with your walking-stick!--
269,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,We will not suffer tamely what you do
270,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And warn you at your peril,--for we'll sic"
271,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Our bumble-bees on you!"""
272,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
273,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"But I smile back, in airy nonchalance,--"
274,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"The more determined on my wayward quest,"
275,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,As some bright memory a moment dawns
276,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,A morning in my breast--
277,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
278,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Sending a thrill that hurries me along
279,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"In faulty similes of childish skips,"
280,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Enthused with lithe contortions of a song
281,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Performing on my lips.
282,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
283,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,In wild meanderings o'er pasture wealth--
284,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Erratic wanderings through dead'ning-lands,"
285,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Where sly old brambles, plucking me by stealth,"
286,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Put berries in my hands:
287,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
288,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Or, the path climbs a boulder--wades a slough--"
289,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Or, rollicking through buttercups and flags,"
290,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Goes gaily dancing o'er a deep bayou
291,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,On old tree-trunks and snags:
292,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
293,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Or, at the creek, leads o'er a limpid pool"
294,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Upon a bridge the stream itself has made,"
295,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,With some Spring-freshet for the mighty tool
296,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,That its foundation laid.
297,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
298,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"I pause a moment here to bend and muse,"
299,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"With dreamy eyes, on my reflection, where"
300,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"A boat-backed bug drifts on a helpless cruise,"
301,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Or wildly oars the air,"
302,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
303,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"As, dimly seen, the pirate of the brook--"
304,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"The pike, whose jaunty hulk denotes his speed--"
305,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Swings pivoting about, with wary look"
306,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Of low and cunning greed.
307,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
308,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Till, filled with other thought, I turn again"
309,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,To where the pathway enters in a realm
310,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Of lordly woodland, under sovereign reign"
311,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Of towering oak and elm.
312,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
313,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,A puritanic quiet here reviles
314,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"The almost whispered warble from the hedge,"
315,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,And takes a locust's rasping voice and files
316,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,The silence to an edge.
317,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
318,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,In such a solitude my somber way
319,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Strays like a misanthrope within a gloom
320,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Of his own shadows--till the perfect day
321,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Bursts into sudden bloom,"
322,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
323,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And crowns a long, declining stretch of space,"
324,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Where King Corn's armies lie with flags unfurled,"
325,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,And where the valley's dint in Nature's face
326,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Dimples a smiling world.
327,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
328,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And lo! through mists that may not be dispelled,"
329,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"I see an old farm homestead, as in dreams,"
330,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Where, like a gem in costly setting held,"
331,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,The old log cabin gleams.
332,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
333,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,*      *      *      *      *
334,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
335,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,O darling Pathway! lead me bravely on
336,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Adown your valley way, and run before"
337,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,Among the roses crowding up the lawn
338,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"And thronging at the door,--"
339,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
340,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,And carry up the echo there that shall
341,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,"Arouse the drowsy dog, that he may bay"
342,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,The household out to greet the prodigal
343,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,That wanders home to-day.
344,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,
345,A COUNTRY PATHWAY.,

350,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,On the banks o' Deer Crick!  There's the place fer me!--
351,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,Worter slidin' past ye jes as clair as it kin be:--
352,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"See yer shadder in it, and the shadder o' the sky,"
353,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,And the shadder o' the buzzard as he goes a-lazein' by;
354,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"Shadder o' the pizen-vines, and shadder o' the trees--"
355,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,And I purt'-nigh said the shadder o' the sunshine and the breeze!

360,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"'Long up where the mill-race comes a-loafin' down,--"
361,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,Like to git up in there--'mongst the sycamores--
362,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"And watch the worter at the dam, a-frothin' as she pours:"
363,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"Crawl out on some old log, with my hook and line,"
364,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,Where the fish is jes so thick you kin see 'em shine
365,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"As they flicker round yer bait, _coaxin_' you to jerk,"

367,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,
368,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,On the banks o' Deer Crick!--Allus my delight
369,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,Jes to be around there--take it day er night!--
370,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,Watch the snipes and killdees foolin' half the day--
371,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,Er these-'ere little worter-bugs skootin' ever'way!--
372,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"Snakefeeders glancin' round, er dartin' out o' sight;"
373,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"And dew-fall, and bullfrogs, and lightnin'-bugs at night--"
374,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"Stars up through the tree-tops--er in the crick below,--"
375,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,And smell o' mussrat through the dark clean from the old b'y-o!
376,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,
377,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"Er take a tromp, some Sund'y, say, 'way up to ""Johnson's Hole,"""
378,ON THE BANKS O' DEER CRICK.,"And find where he's had a fire, and hid his fishin' pole;"

393,I.,I.
394,I.,
395,I.,Would that my lips might pour out in thy praise
396,I.,"A fitting melody--an air sublime,--"
397,I.,A song sun-washed and draped in dreamy haze--
398,I.,The floss and velvet of luxurious rhyme:
399,I.,"A lay wrought of warm languors, and o'er-brimmed"
400,I.,"With balminess, and fragrance of wild flowers"
401,I.,Such as the droning bee ne'er wearies of--
402,I.,Such thoughts as might be hymned
403,I.,To thee from this midsummer land of ours
404,I.,Through shower and sunshine blent for very love.

409,II.,Deep silences in woody aisles wherethrough
410,II.,"Cool paths go loitering, and where the trill"
411,II.,Of best-remembered birds hath something new
412,II.,In cadence for the hearing--lingering still
413,II.,Through all the open day that lies beyond;
414,II.,"Reaches of pasture-lands, vine-wreathen oaks,"
415,II.,"Majestic still in pathos of decay,--"
416,II.,The road--the wayside pond
417,II.,Wherein the dragonfly an instant soaks
418,II.,His filmy wing-tips ere he flits away.
419,II.,
420,II.,
421,III.,III.

423,III.,"And I would pluck from out the dank, rich mould,"
424,III.,"Thick-shaded from the sun of noon, the long"
425,III.,"Lithe stalks of barley, topped with ruddy gold,"
426,III.,And braid them in the meshes of my song;
427,III.,"And with them I would tangle wheat and rye,"
428,III.,And wisps of greenest grass the katydid
429,III.,"Ere crept beneath the blades of, sulkily,"
430,III.,As harvest-hands went by;
431,III.,"And weave of all, as wildest fancy bid,"
432,III.,A crown of mingled song and bloom for thee.

446,A WATER-COLOR.,A sense of utter carelessness and grace
447,A WATER-COLOR.,"Of pure abandon in the slumb'rous scene,--"
448,A WATER-COLOR.,"As if the June, all hoydenish of face,"
449,A WATER-COLOR.,"Had romped herself to sleep there on the green,"

1603,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Was kindo' out o' kilter!--fer I hated Brown, you see,"
1604,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,Worse'n _pizen_--and the feller whittled crutches out fer _me_--
1605,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1606,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,And done a thousand little ac's o' kindness and respec'--
1607,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,And me a-wishin' all the time that I could break his neck!
1608,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,My relief was like a mourner's when the funeral is done
1609,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,When they moved to Illinois in the Fall o' Forty-one.
1610,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1611,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,Then I went to work in airnest--I had nothin' much in view
1612,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"But to drownd out rickollections--and it kep' me busy, too!"
1613,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"But I slowly thrived and prospered, tel Mother used to say"
1614,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,She expected yit to see me a wealthy man some day.
1615,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1616,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Then I'd think how little _money_ was, compared to happiness--"
1617,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,And who'd be left to use it when I died I couldn't guess!
1618,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"But I've still kep' speculatin' and a-gainin' year by year,"
1619,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Tel I'm payin' half the taxes in the county, mighty near!"
1620,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1621,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Well!--A year ago er better, a letter comes to hand"
1622,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,Astin' how I 'd like to dicker fer some Illinois land--
1623,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"""The feller that had owned it,"" it went ahead to state,"
1624,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"""Had jest deceased, insolvent, leavin' chance to speculate,""--"
1625,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1626,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"And then it closed by sayin' that I'd ""better come and see.""--"
1627,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"I'd never been West, anyhow--a most too wild fer me,"
1628,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,I'd allus had a notion; but a lawyer here in town
1629,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,Said I'd find myself mistakend when I come to look around.
1630,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1631,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"So I bids good-bye to Mother, and I jumps aboard the train,"
1632,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,A-thinkin' what I'd bring her when I come back home again--
1633,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"And ef she'd had an idy what the present was to be,"
1634,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,I think it's more 'n likely she'd a-went along with me!
1635,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1636,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Cars is awful tejus ridin', fer all they go so fast!"
1637,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,But finally they called out my stopping-place at last:
1638,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"And that night, at the tavern, I dreamp' I was a train"
1639,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"O' cars, and _skeered_ at sumpin', runnin' down a country lane!"
1640,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1641,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Well, in the mornin' airly--after huntin' up the man--"
1642,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,The lawyer who was wantin' to swap the piece o' land--
1643,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,We started fer the country;' and I ast the history
1644,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Of the farm--its former owner--and so-forth, etcetery!"
1645,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1646,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"And--well--it was _interestin'_--I su'prised him, I suppose,"
1647,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,By the loud and frequent manner in which I blowed my nose!--
1648,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"But his su'prise was greater, and it made him wonder more,"
1649,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,When I kissed and hugged the widder when she met us at the door!--
1650,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1651,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,_It was Mary_: They's a feelin' a-hidin' down in here--
1652,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"Of course I can't explain it, ner ever make it clear.--"
1653,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,It was with us in that meeting I don't want you to fergit!
1654,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,And it makes me kind o' nervous when I think about it yit!
1655,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,
1656,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"I _bought_ that farm, and _deeded_ it, afore I left the town,"
1657,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"With ""title clear to mansions in the skies,"" to Mary Brown!"
1658,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,"And fu'thermore, I took her and _the childern_--fer you see,"
1659,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,They'd never seed their Grandma--and I fetched 'em home with me.
1660,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,

1663,FARMER WHIPPLE.--BACHELOR.,Is a-lookin' glad and smilin'!--And I've jest come into town

1790,BLIND.,I think I have but little need
1791,BLIND.,Of it.  Though you may marvel much
1792,BLIND.,"That _we_, who see by sense of touch"
1793,BLIND.,"And taste and hearing, see things _you_"
1794,BLIND.,May never look upon; and true

1797,BLIND.,"No eyes have in their faces read,"
1798,BLIND.,Or wept to see interpreted.
1799,BLIND.,
1800,BLIND.,And you might think it strange if now

1802,BLIND.,Do I know that?  I hold your hand--
1803,BLIND.,_Its_ language I can understand--
1804,BLIND.,"Give both to me, and I will show"
1805,BLIND.,You many other things I know.
1806,BLIND.,Listen:  We never met before

1809,BLIND.,Are slender; and your eyes are blue--

1812,BLIND.,Your mother's likeness everywhere

1817,BLIND.,Of vocalism--though you may
1818,BLIND.,"Still thrum on the guitar, and play"

1820,BLIND.,I know that by the callous in
1821,BLIND.,The finger-tips of your left hand--
1822,BLIND.,"And, by-the-bye, though nature planned"
1823,BLIND.,"You as most men, you are, I see,"
1824,BLIND.,"""_Left_-handed,"" too,--the mystery"
1825,BLIND.,"Is clear, though,--your right arm has been"
1826,BLIND.,"Broken, to ""break"" the left one in."
1827,BLIND.,"And so, you see, though blind of sight,"
1828,BLIND.,I still have ways of seeing quite
1829,BLIND.,Too well for you to sympathize
1830,BLIND.,"Excessively, with your good eyes.--"
1831,BLIND.,"Though _once_, perhaps, to be sincere,"
1832,BLIND.,"Within the whole asylum here,"
1833,BLIND.,"From cupola to basement hall,"
1834,BLIND.,I was the blindest of them all!

1836,BLIND.,Let us move further down the walk--
1837,BLIND.,"The man here waiting hears my talk,"

1839,BLIND.,Not be quite friendly anyway.
1840,BLIND.,In fact--(this will be far enough;
1841,BLIND.,Sit down)--the man just spoken of
1842,BLIND.,Was once a friend of mine.  He came
1843,BLIND.,For treatment here from Burlingame--
1844,BLIND.,"A rich though brilliant student there,"
1845,BLIND.,"Who read his eyes out of repair,"
1846,BLIND.,"And groped his way up here, where we"
1847,BLIND.,"Became acquainted, and where he"
1848,BLIND.,"Met one of our girl-teachers, and,"
1849,BLIND.,"If you 'll believe me, asked her hand"
1850,BLIND.,"In marriage, though the girl was blind"
1851,BLIND.,As I am--and the girl _declined_.
1852,BLIND.,"Odd, wasn't it?  Look, you can see"
1853,BLIND.,"Him waiting there.  Fine, isn't he?"
1854,BLIND.,"And handsome, eloquently wide"
1855,BLIND.,"And high of brow, and dignified"
1856,BLIND.,"With every outward grace, his sight"
1857,BLIND.,"Restored to him, clear and bright"
1858,BLIND.,"As day-dawn; waiting, waiting still"
1859,BLIND.,For the blind girl that never will
1860,BLIND.,Be wife of his.  How do I know?
1861,BLIND.,You will recall a while ago
1862,BLIND.,I told you he and I were friends.
1863,BLIND.,"In all that friendship comprehends,"
1864,BLIND.,"I was his friend, I swear! why now,"
1865,BLIND.,"Remembering his love, and how"
1866,BLIND.,"His confidence was all my own,"
1867,BLIND.,"I hear, in fancy, the low tone"
1868,BLIND.,"Of his deep voice, so full of pride"
1869,BLIND.,"And passion, yet so pacified"
1870,BLIND.,"With his affliction, that it seems"
1871,BLIND.,An utterance sent out of dreams
1872,BLIND.,"Of saddest melody, withal"
1873,BLIND.,So sorrowfully musical
1874,BLIND.,"It was, and is, must ever be--"
1875,BLIND.,"But I'm digressing, pardon me."
1876,BLIND.,_I_ knew not anything of love
1877,BLIND.,"In those days, but of that above"
1878,BLIND.,"All worldly passion,--for my art--"
1879,BLIND.,"Music,--and that, with all my heart"
1880,BLIND.,"And soul, blent in a love too great"
1881,BLIND.,For words of mine to estimate.
1882,BLIND.,And though among my pupils she
1883,BLIND.,Whose love my friend sought came to me
1884,BLIND.,I only knew her fingers' touch
1885,BLIND.,Because they loitered overmuch
1886,BLIND.,"In simple scales, and needs must be"
1887,BLIND.,Untangled almost constantly.
1888,BLIND.,"But she was bright in other ways,"
1889,BLIND.,"And quick of thought, with ready plays"
1890,BLIND.,"Of wit, and with a voice as sweet"
1891,BLIND.,To listen to as one might meet
1892,BLIND.,In any oratorio--
1893,BLIND.,"And once I gravely told her so,--"
1894,BLIND.,"And, at my words, her limpid tone"
1895,BLIND.,"Of laughter faltered to a moan,"
1896,BLIND.,And fell from that into a sigh
1897,BLIND.,"That quavered all so wearily,"
1898,BLIND.,"That I, without the tear that crept"
1899,BLIND.,"Between the keys, had known she wept;"
1900,BLIND.,And yet the hand I reached for then
1901,BLIND.,"She caught away, and laughed again."
1902,BLIND.,And when that evening I strolled
1903,BLIND.,"With my old friend, I, smiling, told"
1904,BLIND.,Him I believed the girl and he
1905,BLIND.,Were matched and mated perfectly:
1906,BLIND.,"He was so noble; she, so fair"
1907,BLIND.,"Of speech, and womanly of air;"
1908,BLIND.,"He, strong, ambitious; she, as mild"
1909,BLIND.,And artless even as a child;
1910,BLIND.,"And with a nature, I was sure,"
1911,BLIND.,As worshipful as it was pure
1912,BLIND.,"And sweet, and brimmed with tender things"
1913,BLIND.,Beyond his rarest fancyings.
1914,BLIND.,"He stopped me solemnly.  He knew,"
1915,BLIND.,"He said, how good, and just, and true"
1916,BLIND.,Was all I said of her; but as
1917,BLIND.,"For his own virtues, let them pass,"
1918,BLIND.,Since they were nothing to the one
1919,BLIND.,That he had set his heart upon;
1920,BLIND.,For but that morning she had turned
1921,BLIND.,Forever from him.  Then I learned
1922,BLIND.,That for a month he had delayed
1923,BLIND.,"His going from us, with no aid"
1924,BLIND.,"Of hope to hold him,--meeting still"
1925,BLIND.,"Her ever firm denial, till"
1926,BLIND.,Not even in his new-found sight
1927,BLIND.,He found one comfort or delight.
1928,BLIND.,"And as his voice broke there, I felt"
1929,BLIND.,The brother-heart within me melt
1930,BLIND.,In warm compassion for his own
1931,BLIND.,That throbbed so utterly alone.
1932,BLIND.,And then a sudden fancy hit
1933,BLIND.,Along my brain; and coupling it
1934,BLIND.,"With a belief that I, indeed,"
1935,BLIND.,"Might help my friend in his great need,"
1936,BLIND.,I warmly said that I would go
1937,BLIND.,"Myself, if he decided so,"
1938,BLIND.,And see her for him--that I knew
1939,BLIND.,My pleadings would be listened to
1940,BLIND.,"Most seriously, and that she"
1941,BLIND.,"Should love him, listening to me."
1942,BLIND.,Go; bless me!  And that was the last--
1943,BLIND.,The last time his warm hand shut fast
1944,BLIND.,"Within my own--so empty since,"
1945,BLIND.,That the remembered finger-prints
1946,BLIND.,"I 've kissed a thousand times, and wet"
1947,BLIND.,Them with the tears of all regret!
1948,BLIND.,
1949,BLIND.,I know not how to rightly tell
1950,BLIND.,"How fared my quest, and what befell"
1951,BLIND.,"Me, coming in the presence of"
1952,BLIND.,"That blind girl, and her blinder love."
1953,BLIND.,I know but little else than that
1954,BLIND.,Above the chair in which she sat
1955,BLIND.,"I leant--reached for, and found her hand,"
1956,BLIND.,"And held it for a moment, and"
1957,BLIND.,Took up the other--held them both--
1958,BLIND.,"As might a friend, I will take oath:"
1959,BLIND.,"Spoke leisurely, as might a man"
1960,BLIND.,Praying for no thing other than
1961,BLIND.,"He thinks Heaven's justice;--She was blind,"
1962,BLIND.,"I said, and yet a noble mind"
1963,BLIND.,Most truly loved her; one whose fond
1964,BLIND.,Clear-sighted vision looked beyond
1965,BLIND.,"The bounds of her infirmity,"
1966,BLIND.,"And saw the woman, perfectly"
1967,BLIND.,"Modeled, and wrought out pure and true"
1968,BLIND.,"And lovable.  She quailed, and drew"
1969,BLIND.,"Her hands away, but closer still"
1970,BLIND.,"I caught them.  ""Rack me as you will!"""
1971,BLIND.,"She cried out sharply--""Call me 'blind'--"
1972,BLIND.,Love ever is--I am resigned!
1973,BLIND.,Blind is your friend; as blind as he

2762,THE QUIET LODGER.,The man that rooms next door to me:
2763,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Two weeks ago, this very night,"
2764,THE QUIET LODGER.,"He took possession quietly,"
2765,THE QUIET LODGER.,As any other lodger might--
2766,THE QUIET LODGER.,But why the room next mine should so
2767,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Attract him I was vexed to know,--"
2768,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Because his quietude, in fine,"
2769,THE QUIET LODGER.,Was far superior to mine.
2770,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2771,THE QUIET LODGER.,"""Now, I like quiet, truth to tell,"
2772,THE QUIET LODGER.,A tranquil life is sweet to me--
2773,THE QUIET LODGER.,"But _this_,"" I sneered, ""suits me too well.--"
2774,THE QUIET LODGER.,"He shuts his door so noiselessly,"
2775,THE QUIET LODGER.,"And glides about so very mute,"
2776,THE QUIET LODGER.,"In each mysterious pursuit,"
2777,THE QUIET LODGER.,"His silence is oppressive, and"
2778,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Too deep for me to understand."""
2779,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2780,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Sometimes, forgetting book or pen,"
2781,THE QUIET LODGER.,I've found my head in breathless poise
2782,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Lifted, and dropped in shame again,"
2783,THE QUIET LODGER.,Hearing some alien ghost of noise--
2784,THE QUIET LODGER.,Some smothered sound that seemed to be
2785,THE QUIET LODGER.,"A trunk-lid dropped unguardedly,"
2786,THE QUIET LODGER.,Or the crisp writhings of some quire
2787,THE QUIET LODGER.,Of manuscript thrust in the fire.
2788,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2789,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Then I have climbed, and closed in vain"
2790,THE QUIET LODGER.,"My transom, opening in the hall;"
2791,THE QUIET LODGER.,Or close against the window-pane
2792,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Have pressed my fevered face,--but all"
2793,THE QUIET LODGER.,The day or night without held not
2794,THE QUIET LODGER.,A sight or sound or counter-thought
2795,THE QUIET LODGER.,To set my mind one instant free
2796,THE QUIET LODGER.,Of this man's silent mastery.
2797,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2798,THE QUIET LODGER.,And often I have paced the floor
2799,THE QUIET LODGER.,"With muttering anger, far at night,"
2800,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Hearing, and cursing, o'er and o'er,"
2801,THE QUIET LODGER.,"The muffled noises, and the light"
2802,THE QUIET LODGER.,And tireless movements of this guest
2803,THE QUIET LODGER.,Whose silence raged above my rest
2804,THE QUIET LODGER.,Hoarser than howling storms at sea--
2805,THE QUIET LODGER.,The man that rooms next door to me.
2806,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2807,THE QUIET LODGER.,"But twice or thrice, upon the stair,"
2808,THE QUIET LODGER.,"I've seen his face--most strangely wan,--"
2809,THE QUIET LODGER.,Each time upon me unaware
2810,THE QUIET LODGER.,"He came--smooth'd past me, and was gone."
2811,THE QUIET LODGER.,"So like a whisper he went by,"
2812,THE QUIET LODGER.,"I listened after, ear and eye,"
2813,THE QUIET LODGER.,Nor could my chafing fancy tell
2814,THE QUIET LODGER.,The meaning of one syllable.
2815,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2816,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Last night I caught him, face to face,--"
2817,THE QUIET LODGER.,"He entering his room, and I"
2818,THE QUIET LODGER.,Glaring from mine: He paused a space
2819,THE QUIET LODGER.,"And met my scowl all shrinkingly,"
2820,THE QUIET LODGER.,But with full gentleness:  The key
2821,THE QUIET LODGER.,Turned in his door--and I could see
2822,THE QUIET LODGER.,It tremblingly withdrawn and put
2823,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Inside, and then--the door was shut."
2824,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2825,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Then silence.  _Silence_!--why, last night"
2826,THE QUIET LODGER.,"The silence was tumultuous,"
2827,THE QUIET LODGER.,And thundered on till broad daylight;--
2828,THE QUIET LODGER.,O never has it stunned me thus!--
2829,THE QUIET LODGER.,"It rolls, and moans, and mumbles yet.--"
2830,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Ah, God! how loud may silence get"
2831,THE QUIET LODGER.,When man mocks at a brother man
2832,THE QUIET LODGER.,Who answers but as silence can!
2833,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2834,THE QUIET LODGER.,"The silence grew, and grew, and grew,"
2835,THE QUIET LODGER.,Till at high noon to-day 'twas heard
2836,THE QUIET LODGER.,Throughout the house; and men flocked through
2837,THE QUIET LODGER.,"The echoing halls, with faces blurred"
2838,THE QUIET LODGER.,"With pallor, gloom, and fear, and awe,"
2839,THE QUIET LODGER.,And shuddering at what they saw--
2840,THE QUIET LODGER.,"The quiet lodger, as he lay"
2841,THE QUIET LODGER.,Stark of the life he cast away.
2842,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2843,THE QUIET LODGER.,*     *     *     *     *
2844,THE QUIET LODGER.,
2845,THE QUIET LODGER.,"So strange to-night--those voices there,"
2846,THE QUIET LODGER.,Where all so quiet was before;
2847,THE QUIET LODGER.,They say the face has not a care
2848,THE QUIET LODGER.,Nor sorrow in it any more--
2849,THE QUIET LODGER.,"His latest scrawl:--""Forgive me--You"
2850,THE QUIET LODGER.,"Who prayed, 'they know not what they do!'"""
