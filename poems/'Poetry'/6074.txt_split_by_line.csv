76,LADY CLARE,
77,LADY CLARE,"It was the time when lilies blow,"
78,LADY CLARE,And clouds are highest up in air.
79,LADY CLARE,Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe
80,LADY CLARE,"To give his cousin, Lady Clare."
81,LADY CLARE,
82,LADY CLARE,I trow they did not part in scorn:
83,LADY CLARE,Lovers long betrothed were they;
84,LADY CLARE,They two will wed the morrow morn;
85,LADY CLARE,God's blessing on the day!
86,LADY CLARE,
87,LADY CLARE,"""He does not love me for my birth"
88,LADY CLARE,Nor for my lands so broad and fair;
89,LADY CLARE,"He loves me for my own true worth,"
90,LADY CLARE,"And that is well,"" said Lady Clare."
91,LADY CLARE,
92,LADY CLARE,"In there came old Alice the nurse,"
93,LADY CLARE,"Said, ""Who was this that went from thee?"""
94,LADY CLARE,"""It was my cousin,"" said Lady Clare;"
95,LADY CLARE,"""To-morrow he weds with me."""
96,LADY CLARE,
97,LADY CLARE,"""Oh, God be thanked!"" said Alice the nurse,"
98,LADY CLARE,"""That all comes round so just and fair:"
99,LADY CLARE,"Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands,"
100,LADY CLARE,"And you are not the Lady Clare."""
101,LADY CLARE,
102,LADY CLARE,"""Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse,"""
103,LADY CLARE,"Said Lady Clare, ""that ye speak so wild?"""
104,LADY CLARE,"""As God's above,"" said Alice the nurse,"
105,LADY CLARE,"""I speak the truth: you are my child."
106,LADY CLARE,
107,LADY CLARE,The old earl's daughter died at my breast;
108,LADY CLARE,"I speak the truth, as I live by bread!"
109,LADY CLARE,"I buried her like my own sweet child,"
110,LADY CLARE,"And put my child in her stead."""
111,LADY CLARE,
112,LADY CLARE,"""Falsely, falsely have ye done,"
113,LADY CLARE,"O mother,"" she said, ""if this be true,"
114,LADY CLARE,To keep the best man under the sun
115,LADY CLARE,"So many years from his due."""
116,LADY CLARE,
117,LADY CLARE,"""Nay now, my child,"" said Alice the nurse,"
118,LADY CLARE,"""But keep the secret for your life,"
119,LADY CLARE,"And all you have will be Lord Ronald's,"
120,LADY CLARE,"When you are man and wife."""
121,LADY CLARE,
122,LADY CLARE,"""If I'm a beggar born,"" she said"
123,LADY CLARE,"""I will speak out, for I dare not lie,"
124,LADY CLARE,"Pull off, pull off the brooch of gold,"
125,LADY CLARE,"And fling the diamond necklace by."""
126,LADY CLARE,
127,LADY CLARE,"""Nay now, my child,"" said Alice the nurse,"
128,LADY CLARE,"""But keep the secret all you can."""
129,LADY CLARE,"She said, ""Not so; but I will know"
130,LADY CLARE,"If there be any faith in man."""
131,LADY CLARE,
132,LADY CLARE,"""Nay now, what faith?"" said Alice the nurse,"
133,LADY CLARE,"""The man will cleave unto his right."""
134,LADY CLARE,"""And he shall have it,"" the lady replied,"
135,LADY CLARE,"""Though I should die to-night."""
136,LADY CLARE,
137,LADY CLARE,"""Yet give one kiss to your mother, dear!"
138,LADY CLARE,"Alas, my child! I sinned for thee."""
139,LADY CLARE,"""O mother, mother, mother,"" she said,"
140,LADY CLARE,"""So strange it seems to me!"
141,LADY CLARE,
142,LADY CLARE,"""Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear,"
143,LADY CLARE,"My mother dear, if this be so,"
144,LADY CLARE,"And lay your hand upon my head,"
145,LADY CLARE,"And bless me, mother, ere I go."""
146,LADY CLARE,
147,LADY CLARE,"She clad herself in a russen gown,"
148,LADY CLARE,She was no longer Lady Clare:
149,LADY CLARE,"She went by dale, and she went by down,"
150,LADY CLARE,With a single rose in her hair.
151,LADY CLARE,
152,LADY CLARE,The lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought
153,LADY CLARE,Leapt up from where she lay.
154,LADY CLARE,Dropped her head in the maiden's hand.
155,LADY CLARE,And followed her all the way.
156,LADY CLARE,
157,LADY CLARE,Down stepped Lord Ronald from his tower:
158,LADY CLARE,"""O Lady Clare, you shame your worth!"
159,LADY CLARE,"Why come you dressed like a village maid,"
160,LADY CLARE,"That are the flower of the earth?"""
161,LADY CLARE,
162,LADY CLARE,"""If I come dressed like a village maid,"
163,LADY CLARE,I am but as my fortunes are:
164,LADY CLARE,"I am a beggar born,"" she said,"
165,LADY CLARE,"""And not the Lady Clare."""
166,LADY CLARE,
167,LADY CLARE,"""Play me no tricks,"" said Lord Ronald,"
168,LADY CLARE,"""For I am yours in word and in deed;"
169,LADY CLARE,"Play me no tricks,"" said Lord Ronald,"
170,LADY CLARE,"""Your riddle is hard to read."""
171,LADY CLARE,
172,LADY CLARE,"Oh, and proudly stood she up!"
173,LADY CLARE,Her heart within her did not fail:
174,LADY CLARE,"She looked into Lord Ronald's eyes,"
175,LADY CLARE,And told him all her nurse's tale.
176,LADY CLARE,
177,LADY CLARE,He laughed a laugh of merry scorn:
178,LADY CLARE,He turned and kissed her where she stood;
179,LADY CLARE,"""If you are not the heiress born,"
180,LADY CLARE,"And I,"" said he, ""the next in blood--"
181,LADY CLARE,
182,LADY CLARE,"""If you are not the heiress born,"
183,LADY CLARE,"And I,"" said he, ""the lawful heir,"
184,LADY CLARE,"We two will wed to-morrow morn,"
185,LADY CLARE,"And you shall still be Lady Clare."""
