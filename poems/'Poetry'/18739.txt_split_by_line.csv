89,PREFACE.,
90,PREFACE.,
91,PREFACE.,"Wishing to make a continued effort, in an art which, though almost"
92,PREFACE.,"in secret, has been adored and assiduously cultivated from earliest"
93,PREFACE.,"infancy, it was my intention to have chosen some incident from Pagan"
94,PREFACE.,"history, as the foundation of my contemplated poem. But, looking over"
95,PREFACE.,"the Jewish annals, I was induced to select for my purpose, one of"
96,PREFACE.,"their well-known stories which besides its extreme beauty, seemed to"
97,PREFACE.,open an extensive field for the imagination which might therein avail
98,PREFACE.,itself not only of important and elevated truths but pleasing and
99,PREFACE.,popular superstitions.
100,PREFACE.,
101,PREFACE.,Having finished one Canto I left the United States for the West
102,PREFACE.,"Indies in the hope of being able to sail thence for Great Britain,"
103,PREFACE.,where I might submit what I had done to the candour of some able
104,PREFACE.,"writer; publish it, if thought expedient; and obtain advice and"
105,PREFACE.,materials for the improvement and prosecution of my work. But as
106,PREFACE.,events have transpired to frustrate that intention I have endeavored
107,PREFACE.,"to make it as perfect, as with the means I have access to, is"
108,PREFACE.,possible.
109,PREFACE.,
110,PREFACE.,"It is, now, far beneath what might have been done, under the"
111,PREFACE.,influence of more decided hopes and more auspicious circumstances.
112,PREFACE.,"Yet, as it is, I am induced to place it before the public, with that"
113,PREFACE.,anxiety which naturally attends the doubtful accomplishment of any
114,PREFACE.,"favourite object, on the principle that no artist can make the same"
115,PREFACE.,"improvement, or labour with so much pleasure to himself, in private,"
116,PREFACE.,"as when comparing his efforts with those of others, and listening to"
117,PREFACE.,"the opinions of critics and the remarks of connoisseurs. The beauty,"
118,PREFACE.,"though she may view herself, in her mirror, from the ringlets of her"
119,PREFACE.,"hair to the sole of her slipper, and appear most lovely to her own"
120,PREFACE.,"gaze, can never be certain of her power to please until the suffrage"
121,PREFACE.,"of society confirm the opinion formed in seclusion; and ""Qu'est ce"
122,PREFACE.,"que la beaute s'elle ne touche pas?"""
123,PREFACE.,
124,PREFACE.,Literary employments are necessary to the happiness and almost to
125,PREFACE.,the vitality of those who pursue them with much ardour; and though
126,PREFACE.,"the votaries of the muses are, too often, debased by faults, yet,"
127,PREFACE.,"abstractedly considered, a taste for any art, if well directed, must"
128,PREFACE.,"seem a preservative not only against melancholy, but even against"
129,PREFACE.,misery and vice.
130,PREFACE.,
131,PREFACE.,"Genius, whatever its bent, supposes a refined and delicate moral"
132,PREFACE.,"sense and though sometimes perverted by sophistry or circumstance,"
133,PREFACE.,"and sometimes failing through weakness; can always, at least,"
134,PREFACE.,"comprehend and feel, the grandeur of honour and the beauty of virtue."
135,PREFACE.,
136,PREFACE.,As to the faults of those to whom the world allows the possession of
137,PREFACE.,"genius, there are, perhaps, good grounds for the belief that they"
138,PREFACE.,have actually fewer than those employed about ordinary affairs; but
139,PREFACE.,the last are easily concealed and the first carefully dragged to
140,PREFACE.,light.
141,PREFACE.,
142,PREFACE.,"The miseries too, sometimes attendant to persons of distinguished"
143,PREFACE.,"literary attainments, are often held forth as a subject of ""warn and"
144,PREFACE.,"scare"" but Cervantes and Camoens would both have been cast into"
145,PREFACE.,"prison even though unable to read or write, and Savage, though a"
146,PREFACE.,"mechanic or scrivener, would probably have possessed the same"
147,PREFACE.,"failings and consequently have fallen into the same, or a greater"
148,PREFACE.,"degree of poverty and suffering. Alas! how many, in the flower of"
149,PREFACE.,"youth and strength, perish in the loathsome dungeons of this island,"
150,PREFACE.,"and, when dead, are refused a decent grave; who, in many instances,"
151,PREFACE.,were their histories traced by an able pen would be wept by half the
152,PREFACE.,civilized world.
153,PREFACE.,
154,PREFACE.,Although I can boast nothing but an extreme and unquenchable love
155,PREFACE.,"for the art to which my humble aspirations are confined, my lyre has"
156,PREFACE.,been a solace when every thing else has failed; soothing when
157,PREFACE.,"agitated, and when at peace furnishing that exercise and excitement"
158,PREFACE.,"without which the mind becomes sick, and all her faculties retrograde"
159,PREFACE.,"when they ought to be advancing. Men, when they feel that nature has"
160,PREFACE.,"kindled in their bosoms a flame which must incessantly be fed, can"
161,PREFACE.,"cultivate eloquence and exert it, in aid of the unfortunate before"
162,PREFACE.,"the judgment seats of their country; or endeavour to ""lure to the"
163,PREFACE.,"skies"" such as enter the temples of their god; but woman, alike"
164,PREFACE.,"subject to trials and vicissitudes and endowed with the same wishes,"
165,PREFACE.,"(for the observation, ""there is no sex to soul,"" is certainly not"
166,PREFACE.,"untrue,) condemned, perhaps, to a succession of arduous though minute"
167,PREFACE.,"duties in which, oftentimes, there is nothing to charm and little to"
168,PREFACE.,"distract, unless she be allowed the exercise of her pen must fall"
169,PREFACE.,"into melancholy and despair, and perish, (to use the language of Mad."
170,PREFACE.,"de Stael,) ""consumed by her own energies."""
171,PREFACE.,
172,PREFACE.,Thus do we endeavour to excuse any inordinate or extreme attachment
173,PREFACE.,by labouring to show in their highest colours the merits of its
174,PREFACE.,object.
175,PREFACE.,
176,PREFACE.,"Zophiel may or may not be called entirely a creature of imagination,"
177,PREFACE.,"as comports with the faith of the reader; he is not, however, endowed"
178,PREFACE.,with a single miraculous attribute; for which the general belief of
179,PREFACE.,"ages, even among christians, may not be produced as authority."
180,PREFACE.,
181,PREFACE.,The stanza in which his story is told though less complicate and
182,PREFACE.,"beautiful than the Spencerian, is equally ancient; and favorable to a"
183,PREFACE.,"pensive melody, is also susceptible of much variety."
184,PREFACE.,
185,PREFACE.,The marginal notes will be useless to such as have read much.

197,INVOCATION.,"Thou with the dark blue eye upturned to heaven,"
198,INVOCATION.,"And cheek now pale, now warm with radiant glow,"
199,INVOCATION.,"Daughter of God,--most dear,--"
200,INVOCATION.,"Come with thy quivering tear,"
201,INVOCATION.,"And tresses wild, and robes of loosened flow,--"
202,INVOCATION.,To thy lone votaress let one look be given!
203,INVOCATION.,
204,INVOCATION.,"Come Poesy! nor like some just-formed maid,"
205,INVOCATION.,With heart as yet unswoln by bliss or woe;--
206,INVOCATION.,But of such age be seen
207,INVOCATION.,"As Egypt's glowing queen,"
208,INVOCATION.,When her brave Roman learned to love her so
209,INVOCATION.,"That death and loss of fame, were, by a smile, repaid."
210,INVOCATION.,
211,INVOCATION.,"Or as thy Sappho, when too fierce assailed"
212,INVOCATION.,By stern ingratitude her tender breast:--
213,INVOCATION.,Her love by scorn repaid
214,INVOCATION.,"Her friendship true betrayed,"
215,INVOCATION.,"Sick of the guileful earth, she sank for rest"
216,INVOCATION.,In the cold waves embrace; while Grecian muse bewailed.
217,INVOCATION.,
218,INVOCATION.,"Be to my mortal eye, like some fair dame--"
219,INVOCATION.,"Ripe, but untouched by time; whose frequent blush"
220,INVOCATION.,Plays o'er her cheek of truth
221,INVOCATION.,As soft as earliest youth;
222,INVOCATION.,While thoughts exalted to her mild eye rush--
223,INVOCATION.,"And the expanded soul, tells 'twas from heaven it came."
224,INVOCATION.,
225,INVOCATION.,"Daughter of life's first cause; who, when he saw"
226,INVOCATION.,"The ills that unborn innocents must bear,"
227,INVOCATION.,When doomed to come to earth--
228,INVOCATION.,Bethought--and gave thee birth
229,INVOCATION.,To charm the poison from affliction there;
230,INVOCATION.,"And from his source eternal, bade thee draw."
231,INVOCATION.,
232,INVOCATION.,"He gave thee power, inferior to his own"
233,INVOCATION.,But in control o'er matter. 'Mid the crash
234,INVOCATION.,"Of earthquake, war, and storm,"
235,INVOCATION.,Is seen thy radiant form
236,INVOCATION.,"Thou com'st at midnight on the lightning's flash,"
237,INVOCATION.,And ope'st to those thou lov'st new scenes and worlds unknown.
238,INVOCATION.,
239,INVOCATION.,"And still, as wild barbarians fiercely break"
240,INVOCATION.,The graceful column and the marble dome--
241,INVOCATION.,Where arts too long have lain
242,INVOCATION.,"Debased at pleasure's fain,"
243,INVOCATION.,"And bleeding justice called on wrath to come,"
244,INVOCATION.,"'Mid ruins heaped around, thou bidst thy votarists wake."
245,INVOCATION.,
246,INVOCATION.,Methinks I see thee on the broken shrine
247,INVOCATION.,Of some fall'n temple--where the grass waves high
248,INVOCATION.,With many a flowret wild;
249,INVOCATION.,"While some lone, pensive, child"
250,INVOCATION.,Looks on the sculpture with a wondering eye
251,INVOCATION.,Whose kindling fires betray that he is chosen thine. [FN#1]
252,INVOCATION.,
253,INVOCATION.,
254,INVOCATION.,"[FN#1]  Genius, perhaps, has often, nay generally, been awakened and"
255,INVOCATION.,"the whole future bent of the mind thus strongly operated upon,"
256,INVOCATION.,"determined, by some circumstance trivial as this."
257,INVOCATION.,
258,INVOCATION.,
259,INVOCATION.,Or on some beetling cliff--where the mad waves
260,INVOCATION.,"Rush echoing thro' the high-arched caves below,"
261,INVOCATION.,I view some love-reft fair
262,INVOCATION.,"Whose sighing warms the air,"
263,INVOCATION.,Gaze anxious on the ocean as it raves
264,INVOCATION.,"And call on thee-alone, of power to sooth her woe."
265,INVOCATION.,
266,INVOCATION.,Friend of the wretched; smoother of the couch
267,INVOCATION.,Of pining hope; thy pitying form I know!
268,INVOCATION.,"Where thro' the wakeful night,"
269,INVOCATION.,"By a dim taper's light,"
270,INVOCATION.,"Lies a pale youth, upon his pallet low,"
271,INVOCATION.,Whose wan and woe-worn charms rekindle at thy touch.
272,INVOCATION.,
273,INVOCATION.,Friendless--oppressed by fate--the restless fires
274,INVOCATION.,Of his thralled soul prey on his beauteous frame--
275,INVOCATION.,"Till, strengthened by thine aid,"
276,INVOCATION.,"He shapes some kindred maid,"
277,INVOCATION.,"Pours forth in song the life consuming flame,"
278,INVOCATION.,And for awhile forgets his sufferings and desires.
279,INVOCATION.,
280,INVOCATION.,"Scorner of thoughtless grandeur, thou hast chose"
281,INVOCATION.,Thy _best-beloved_ from ruddy Nature's breast:
282,INVOCATION.,The grotto dark and rude--
283,INVOCATION.,The forest solitude--
284,INVOCATION.,The craggy mount by blushing clouds carest--
285,INVOCATION.,Have altars where thy light etherial glows. [FN#2]
286,INVOCATION.,
287,INVOCATION.,
288,INVOCATION.,"[FN#2]  Every nation, however rude, has, as it has been justly"
289,INVOCATION.,"observed, a taste for poetry. This art after all that has and can be"
290,INVOCATION.,"said for and against it, is the language of nature, and among the"
291,INVOCATION.,relics of the most polished and learned nations little has survived
292,INVOCATION.,except such as simply depicts those natural feelings and images which
293,INVOCATION.,have ever existed and ever must continue. Most of the great poets
294,INVOCATION.,have been individuals of humble condition rising from the mass of the
295,INVOCATION.,people by that natural principle which causes the most etherial
296,INVOCATION.,"particles to rise and the denser to sink to the earth. But, as Byron"
297,INVOCATION.,"exquisitely says, in one of the most wonderfully beautiful pages he"
298,INVOCATION.,"ever composed,"
299,INVOCATION.,
300,INVOCATION.,
301,INVOCATION.,"""Many are poets who have never penned"
302,INVOCATION.,"Their inspirations, and, perchance, the best;"
303,INVOCATION.,"They felt, they loved, and died; but would not lend"
304,INVOCATION.,Their thoughts to meaner beings; they comprest
305,INVOCATION.,"The god within them, and rejoined the stars"
306,INVOCATION.,"Unlaurel'd upon earth."""
307,INVOCATION.,
308,INVOCATION.,
309,INVOCATION.,In the place where I now write amid several hundred Africans of
310,INVOCATION.,"different ages, and nations, the most debased of any on the face of"
311,INVOCATION.,"the earth, I have been enabled to observe, even in this, last link of"
312,INVOCATION.,"the chain of humanity, the strong natural love for music and poetry."
313,INVOCATION.,
314,INVOCATION.,"Any little incident which occurs on the estate where they toil, and"
315,INVOCATION.,"which the greater part of them are never suffered to leave, is"
316,INVOCATION.,"immediately made the subject of a rude song which they, in their"
317,INVOCATION.,"broken Spanish, sing to their companions; and thereby relieve a"
318,INVOCATION.,little the monotony of their lives.
319,INVOCATION.,
320,INVOCATION.,"I have observed these poor creatures, under various circumstances,"
321,INVOCATION.,"and though, generally, extremely brutal, have, in some instances,"
322,INVOCATION.,"heard touches of sentiment from them, when under the influence of"
323,INVOCATION.,"grief, equal to any which have flowed from the pen of Rousseau."
324,INVOCATION.,
325,INVOCATION.,
326,INVOCATION.,Thy sovereign priest by earth's vile sons was driven
327,INVOCATION.,To make the cold unconscious earth his bed: [FN#3]
328,INVOCATION.,The damp cave mocked his sighs--
329,INVOCATION.,"But from his sightless eyes,"
330,INVOCATION.,"Wrung forth by wrongs, the anguished drops he shed,"
331,INVOCATION.,Fell each as an appeal to summon thee from heaven.
332,INVOCATION.,
333,INVOCATION.,Thou sought'st him in his desolation; placed
334,INVOCATION.,On thy warm bosom his unpillowed head;
335,INVOCATION.,Bade him for visions live
336,INVOCATION.,More bright than worlds can give;
337,INVOCATION.,O'er his pale lips thy soul infusive shed
338,INVOCATION.,That left his dust adored where kings decay untraced.
339,INVOCATION.,
340,INVOCATION.,
341,INVOCATION.,"[FN#3]  ""On the banks of the Meles was shown the spot where"
342,INVOCATION.,"Critheis, the mother of Homer, brought him into the world, and the"
343,INVOCATION.,cavern to which he retired to compose his immortal verses. A monument
344,INVOCATION.,erected to his memory and inscribed with his name stood in the middle
345,INVOCATION.,of the city--it was adorned with spacious porticos under which the
346,INVOCATION.,"citizens assembled."""
347,INVOCATION.,
348,INVOCATION.,
349,INVOCATION.,Source of deep feeling--of surpassing love--

351,INVOCATION.,Since man from dust arose
352,INVOCATION.,His birth the cherub owes [FN#4]
353,INVOCATION.,To thee--by thee his rapturous harp was given
354,INVOCATION.,And white wings tipp'd with gold that cool the domes above.
355,INVOCATION.,
356,INVOCATION.,
357,INVOCATION.,[FN#4]  The Indians (says M. de Voltaire) from whom every species of
358,INVOCATION.,"theology is derived, invented the angels and represented them in"
359,INVOCATION.,"their ancient book the ""Shasta,"" as immortal creatures, participating"
360,INVOCATION.,in the divinity of their creator; against whom a great number
361,INVOCATION.,"revolted in heaven, ""Les Parsis ignicoles, qui subsistent encore ont"
362,INVOCATION.,communique a l'auteur de la religion des anciens Perses les noms des
363,INVOCATION.,anges que les premiers Perses reconnaissaient. On en trouve cent-dix-
364,INVOCATION.,"neuf, parmi desquels ne sont ni Raphael ni Gabriel que les Perses"

368,INVOCATION.,
369,INVOCATION.,Husher of secret sighs--from childhood's hour
370,INVOCATION.,"The slave of Fate, I've knelt before thy throne;"

372,INVOCATION.,"Whene'er my heart has bled,"
373,INVOCATION.,And every ray of bliss that heart has known
374,INVOCATION.,Has reached it thro' thy grief-dispelling power.
375,INVOCATION.,
376,INVOCATION.,Fain thro' my native solitudes I'd roam
377,INVOCATION.,Bathe my rude harp in my bright native streams
378,INVOCATION.,Twine it with flowers that bloom
379,INVOCATION.,"But for the deserts gloom,"
380,INVOCATION.,"Or, for the long and jetty hair that gleams"
381,INVOCATION.,O'er the dark-bosomed maid that makes the wild her home. [FN#5]
382,INVOCATION.,
383,INVOCATION.,
384,INVOCATION.,[FN#5]  This invocation when composed was intended to precede a
385,INVOCATION.,series of poems entitled Occidental Eclogues; which work the writer
386,INVOCATION.,has never found opportunity to finish.
387,INVOCATION.,
388,INVOCATION.,
389,INVOCATION.,"I sing not for the crowd, or low or high--"
390,INVOCATION.,A pensive wanderer on life's thorny heath
391,INVOCATION.,Earth's pageants for my view
392,INVOCATION.,"Have nought: I love but few,"

400,INVOCATION.,
401,INVOCATION.,Forsake me not! none ever loved thee more!

403,INVOCATION.,If mid the scene severe
404,INVOCATION.,"Thou'lt drop on me one tear,"
405,INVOCATION.,And let thy flitting form sometimes beguile
406,INVOCATION.,The present of its ills--I'll scorn them and adore.
407,INVOCATION.,
408,INVOCATION.,Then warm the form relentless fate would chill--
409,INVOCATION.,Dark lours my night--Oh! give me one embrace!
410,INVOCATION.,If every pain I bear

925,XXVI.,Sighed forth o'erpowering breath; increased the heat;

927,XXVI.,"Could now no more. Lone in the still retreat,"

950,XXVII.,"Peeped brightly azure, while with tender moan"

952,XXVII.,
953,XXVII.,"Sportive;--about her neck their gold he twined,"

1813,ODE.,"Fair as the hues of heaven, the innocent"
