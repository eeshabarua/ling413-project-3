148,THE WIND.,Night comes upon the earth; and fearfully
149,THE WIND.,"Arise the mighty winds, and sweep along"
150,THE WIND.,In the full chorus of their midnight song.
151,THE WIND.,"The waste of heavy clouds, that veil the sky,"
152,THE WIND.,"Roll like a murky scroll before them driven,"
153,THE WIND.,And show faint glimpses of a darker heaven.
154,THE WIND.,"No ray is there of moon, or pale-eyed star,"
155,THE WIND.,Darkness is on the universe; save where
156,THE WIND.,"The western sky lies glimmering, faint and far,"
157,THE WIND.,With day's red embers dimly glowing there.
158,THE WIND.,"Hark! how the wind comes gathering in its course,"
159,THE WIND.,"And sweeping onward, with resistless force,"
160,THE WIND.,"Howls through the silent space of starless skies,"
161,THE WIND.,And on the breast of the swol'n ocean dies.
162,THE WIND.,"Oh, though art terrible, thou viewless power!"
163,THE WIND.,That rid'st destroying at the midnight hour!
164,THE WIND.,"We hear thy mighty pinion, but the eye"
165,THE WIND.,Knows nothing of thine awful majesty.
166,THE WIND.,We see all mute creation bow before
167,THE WIND.,"Thy viewless wings, as thou careerest o'er"
168,THE WIND.,This rocking world; that in the boundless sky
169,THE WIND.,"Suspended, vibrates, as thou rushest by."
170,THE WIND.,"There is no terror in the lightning's glare,"
171,THE WIND.,That breaks its red track through the trackless air;
172,THE WIND.,There is no terror in the voice that speaks
173,THE WIND.,From out the clouds when the loud thunder breaks
174,THE WIND.,"Over the earth, like that which dwells in thee,"
175,THE WIND.,Thou unseen tenant of immensity.

184,EASTERN SUNSET.,That floats through the evening sky:
185,EASTERN SUNSET.,"With his note of love, he replies again,"
186,EASTERN SUNSET.,To the muezzin's holy cry;
187,EASTERN SUNSET.,"As it sweetly sounds on the rosy air,"
188,EASTERN SUNSET.,"""Allah, il allah! come to prayer!"""
189,EASTERN SUNSET.,"Warm o'er the waters the red sun is glowing,"
190,EASTERN SUNSET.,"'Tis the last parting glance of his splendour and might,"
191,EASTERN SUNSET.,While each rippling wave on the bright shore is throwing
192,EASTERN SUNSET.,"Its white crest, that breaks into showers of light."
193,EASTERN SUNSET.,Each distant mosque and minaret
194,EASTERN SUNSET.,"Is shining in the setting sun,"
195,EASTERN SUNSET.,"Whose farewell look is brighter yet,"
196,EASTERN SUNSET.,Than that with which his course begun.
197,EASTERN SUNSET.,"On the dark blue mountains his smile is bright,"
198,EASTERN SUNSET.,"It glows on the orange grove's waving height,"
199,EASTERN SUNSET.,And breaks through its shade in long lines of light.
200,EASTERN SUNSET.,"No sound on the earth, and no sound in the sky,"
201,EASTERN SUNSET.,"Save murmuring fountains that sparkle nigh,"
202,EASTERN SUNSET.,"And the rustling flight of the evening breeze,"
203,EASTERN SUNSET.,"Who steals from his nest in the cypress trees,"
204,EASTERN SUNSET.,"And a thousand dewy odours fling,"
205,EASTERN SUNSET.,"As he shakes their white buds from his gossamer wing,"
206,EASTERN SUNSET.,"And flutters away through the spicy air,"
207,EASTERN SUNSET.,At sound of a footstep drawing near.

215,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Farewell awhile, beautiful Italy!"
216,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,My lonely bark is launched upon the sea
217,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"That clasps thy shore, and the soft evening gale"
218,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Breathes from thy coast, and fills my parting sail."
219,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Ere morning dawn, a colder breeze will come,"
220,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,And bear me onward to my northern home;
221,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"That home, where the pale sun is not so bright,"
222,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"So glorious, at his noonday's fiercest height,"
223,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"As when he throws his last glance o'er the sea,"
224,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"And fires the heavens, that glow farewell on thee."
225,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,Fair Italy! perchance some future day
226,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,Upon thy coast again will see me stray;
227,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Meantime, farewell!  I sorrow, as I leave"
228,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Thy lovely shore behind me, as men grieve"
229,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"When bending o'er a form, around whose charms,"
230,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Unconquered yet, Death winds his icy arms:"
231,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"While leaving the last kiss on some dear cheek,"
232,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Where beauty sheds her last autumnal streak,"
233,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Life's rosy flower just mantling into bloom,"
234,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,Before it fades for ever in the tomb.
235,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"So I leave thee, oh! thou art lovely still!"
236,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,Despite the clouds of infamy and ill
237,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,That gather thickly round thy fading form:
238,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Still glow thy glorious skies, as bright and warm,"
239,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Still memory lingers fondly on thy strand,"
240,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,And Genius hails thee still her native land.
241,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Land of my soul's adoption! o'er the sea,"
242,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,Thy sunny shore is fading rapidly:
243,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"Fainter and fainter, from my gaze it dies,"
244,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"'Till like a line of distant light it lies,"
245,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"A melting boundary 'twixt earth and sky,"
246,FAREWELL TO ITALY.,"And now 'tis gone;--farewell, fair Italy!"
