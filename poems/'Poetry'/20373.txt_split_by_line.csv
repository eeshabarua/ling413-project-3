183,THE DREAMERS,The gypsies passed her little gate--
184,THE DREAMERS,"She stopped her wheel to see,--"
185,THE DREAMERS,"A brown-faced pair who walked the road,"
186,THE DREAMERS,Free as the wind is free;
187,THE DREAMERS,And suddenly her tidy room
188,THE DREAMERS,A prison seemed to be.
189,THE DREAMERS,
190,THE DREAMERS,"Her shining plates against the walls,"
191,THE DREAMERS,"Her sunlit, sanded floor,"
192,THE DREAMERS,The brass-bound wedding chest that held
193,THE DREAMERS,"Her linen's snowy store,"
194,THE DREAMERS,"The very wheel whose humming died,--"
195,THE DREAMERS,Seemed only chains she bore.
196,THE DREAMERS,
197,THE DREAMERS,She watched the foot-free gypsies pass;
198,THE DREAMERS,She never knew or guessed
199,THE DREAMERS,The wistful dream that drew them close--
200,THE DREAMERS,The longing in each breast
201,THE DREAMERS,"Some day to know a home like hers,"
202,THE DREAMERS,Wherein their hearts might rest.

210,I,I
211,I,
212,I,"White rose-leaves in my hands,"
213,I,I toss you all away;
214,I,The winds shall blow you through the world
215,I,To seek my wedding day.
216,I,"Or East you go, or West you go"
217,I,"And fall on land or sea,"
218,I,Find the one that I love best
219,I,And bring him here to me.
220,I,And if he finds me spinning
221,I,'Tis short I'll break my thread;
222,I,And if he finds me dancing
223,I,I'll dance with him instead;
224,I,If he finds me at the Mass--
225,I,"(Ah, let this not be,"
226,I,Lest I forget my sweetest saint
227,I,The while he kneels by me!)

231,II,
232,II,My lilies are like nuns in white
233,II,"That guard me well all day,"
234,II,"But the red, red rose that near them grows"
235,II,Is wiser far than they.
236,II,"Oh, red rose, wise rose,"
237,II,Keep my secret well;
238,II,"I kiss you twice, I kiss you thrice"
239,II,To pray you not to tell.
240,II,"My lilies sleep beneath the moon,"
241,II,"But wide awake are you,"
242,II,And you have heard a certain word
243,II,And seen a dream come true.
244,II,"Oh, red rose, wise rose,"
245,II,"Silence for my sake,"
246,II,Nor drop to-night a petal light
247,II,Lest my white lilies wake.

251,III,
252,III,Will the garden never forget
253,III,"That it whispers over and over,"
254,III,"""Where is your lover, Nanette?"
255,III,"Where is your lover--your lover?"""
256,III,"Oh, roses I helped to grow,"
257,III,"Oh, lily and mignonette,"
258,III,"Must you always question me so,"
259,III,"""Where is your lover, Nanette?"""
260,III,"Since you looked on my joy one day,"
261,III,Is my grief then a lesser thing?
262,III,Have you only this to say
263,III,When I pray you for comforting?
264,III,Now that I walk alone
265,III,"Here where our hands were met,"
266,III,"Must you whisper me every one,"
267,III,"""Where is your lover, Nanette?"""
268,III,
269,III,"I have mourned with you year and year,"
270,III,"When the Autumn has left you bare,"
271,III,And now that my heart is sere
272,III,Does not one of your roses care?
273,III,"Oh, help me forget--forget,"
274,III,"Nor question over and over,"
275,III,"""Where is your lover, Nanette?"
276,III,"Where is your lover--your lover?"""

283,THE RETURN,
284,THE RETURN,I lost Young Love so long ago
285,THE RETURN,"I had forgot him quite,"
286,THE RETURN,Until a little lass and lad
287,THE RETURN,Went by my door to-night.
288,THE RETURN,
289,THE RETURN,"Ah, hand in hand, but not alone,"
290,THE RETURN,"They passed my open door,"
291,THE RETURN,For with them walked that other one
292,THE RETURN,Who paused here Mays before.
293,THE RETURN,
294,THE RETURN,"And I, who had forgotten long,"
295,THE RETURN,Knew suddenly the grace
296,THE RETURN,Of one who in an empty land
297,THE RETURN,Beholds a kinsman's face.
298,THE RETURN,
299,THE RETURN,"Oh, Young Love, gone these many years,"
300,THE RETURN,"'Twas you came back to-night,"
301,THE RETURN,And laid your hand on my two eyes
302,THE RETURN,"That they might see aright,"
303,THE RETURN,
304,THE RETURN,And took my listless hand in yours
305,THE RETURN,"(Your hands without a stain),"
306,THE RETURN,And touched me on my tired heart
307,THE RETURN,That it might beat again.

316,BLACK SHEEP,"_Have you any wool?""_"
317,BLACK SHEEP,"_""That I have, my Master,_"
318,BLACK SHEEP,"_Three bags full.""_"
319,BLACK SHEEP,
320,BLACK SHEEP,One is for the mother who prays for me at night--
321,BLACK SHEEP,A gift of broken promises to count by candle-light.
322,BLACK SHEEP,
323,BLACK SHEEP,One is for the tried friend who raised me when I fell--
324,BLACK SHEEP,A gift of weakling's tinsel oaths that strew the path to hell.
325,BLACK SHEEP,
326,BLACK SHEEP,And one is for the true love--the heaviest of all--
327,BLACK SHEEP,That holds the pieces of a faith a careless hand let fall.
328,BLACK SHEEP,
329,BLACK SHEEP,"_Black Sheep, Black Sheep,_"
330,BLACK SHEEP,_Have you ought to say?_
331,BLACK SHEEP,"_A word to each, my Master,_"
332,BLACK SHEEP,_Ere I go my way._
333,BLACK SHEEP,
334,BLACK SHEEP,A word unto my mother to bid her think o' me
335,BLACK SHEEP,Only as a little lad playing at her knee.
336,BLACK SHEEP,
337,BLACK SHEEP,A word unto my tried friend to bid him see again
338,BLACK SHEEP,Two laughing lads in Springtime a-racing down the glen.
339,BLACK SHEEP,
340,BLACK SHEEP,A word unto my true love--a single word--to pray
341,BLACK SHEEP,If one day I cross her path to turn her eyes away.

348,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,
349,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Monseigneur plays his new gavotte--
350,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Within her gilded chair the Queen
351,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Listens, her rustling maids between;"
352,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,A very tulip-garden stirred
353,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,To hear the fluting of a bird;
354,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Faint sunlight through the casement falls
355,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,On cupids painted on the walls
356,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,At play with doves. Precisely set
357,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Awaits the slender legged spinet
358,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Expectant of its happy lot,"
359,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,The while the player stays to twist
360,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,The cobweb ruffle from his wrist.
361,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"A pause, and then--(Ah, whisper not)"
362,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Monseigneur plays his new gavotte.
363,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,
364,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Monseigneur plays his new gavotte--
365,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Hark, 'tis the faintest dawn of Spring,"
366,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,So still the dew drops whispering
367,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Is loud upon the violets;
368,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Here in this garden of Pierrettes'
369,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Where Pierrot waits, ah, hasten Sweet,"
370,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"And hear; on dainty, tripping feet"
371,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"She comes--the little, glad coquette."
372,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"""Ah thou, Pierrot?"" ""Ah thou, Pierrette?"""
373,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"A kiss, nay, hear--a bird wakes, then"
374,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"A silence--and they kiss again,"
375,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"""Ah, Mesdames, have you quite forgot--"""
376,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"(So laughs his music.) ""Love's first kiss?"
377,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Let this note lead you then, and this"
378,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Back to that fragrant garden-spot."""
379,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Monseigneur plays his new gavotte.
380,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,
381,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Monseigneur plays his new gavotte--
382,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Ah, hear--in that last note they go"
383,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,The little lovers laughing so;
384,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Kissing their finger-tips, they dance"
385,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,From out this gilded room of France.
386,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Adieu! Monseigneur rises now
387,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Ready for compliment and bow,"
388,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Playing about his mouth the while
389,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Its cynical, accustomed smile,"
390,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"Protests and, hand on heart, avers"
391,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,The patience of his listeners.
392,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,"""A masterpiece? Ah, surely not."""
393,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,A grey-eyed maid of honour slips
394,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,A long stemmed rose across her lips
395,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,And drops it; does he guess her thought?
396,MONSEIGNEUR PLAYS,Monseigneur plays his new gavotte.

407,UNBELIEF,"Lord, what of us who have no light to see"
408,UNBELIEF,"And in the darkness doubt, whose hands may be"
409,UNBELIEF,"Broken upon the door, who find but cold"
410,UNBELIEF,"Ashes of words where others see enscrolled,"
411,UNBELIEF,The glorious promise of Life's victory.

413,UNBELIEF,"Oh, well for those to whom You gave the light"
414,UNBELIEF,(The light we may not see by) whose award

416,UNBELIEF,"Yet we, your people stumbling in the night,"

428,THE SILENT ONE,"Come out with me, dear silent one,"
429,THE SILENT ONE,And trip it on the green.
430,THE SILENT ONE,
431,THE SILENT ONE,"""Nay, Lad, go you within its light,"
432,THE SILENT ONE,Nor stay to urge me so--
433,THE SILENT ONE,'Twas on another moonlit night
434,THE SILENT ONE,"My heart broke long ago."""
435,THE SILENT ONE,
436,THE SILENT ONE,Oh loud and high the pipers play
437,THE SILENT ONE,To speed the dancers on;
438,THE SILENT ONE,"Come out and be as glad as they,"
439,THE SILENT ONE,"Oh, little Silent one."
440,THE SILENT ONE,
441,THE SILENT ONE,"""Nay, Lad, where all your mates are met"
442,THE SILENT ONE,"Go you the selfsame way,"
443,THE SILENT ONE,Another dance I would forget
444,THE SILENT ONE,"Wherein I too was gay."""
445,THE SILENT ONE,
446,THE SILENT ONE,But here you sit long day by day
447,THE SILENT ONE,With those whose joys are done;
448,THE SILENT ONE,What mates these townfolk old and grey
449,THE SILENT ONE,For you dear Silent one.
450,THE SILENT ONE,
451,THE SILENT ONE,"""Nay, Lad, they're done with joys and fears."
452,THE SILENT ONE,"Rare comrades should we prove,"

463,THE ROSE,Counting it only as a rose to wear
464,THE ROSE,"A little moment on my heart no more,"
465,THE ROSE,"So many roses had I worn before,"
466,THE ROSE,So lightly that I scarce believed them there.
467,THE ROSE,
468,THE ROSE,"But, Lo! this rose between the dusk and dawn"
469,THE ROSE,"Hath turned to very flame upon my breast,"
470,THE ROSE,"A flame that burns the day-long and the night,"
471,THE ROSE,A flame of very anguish and delight
472,THE ROSE,That not for any moment yields me rest.
473,THE ROSE,
474,THE ROSE,"And I am troubled with a strange, new fear,"
475,THE ROSE,How would it be if even to your door
476,THE ROSE,"I came to cry your pitying one day,"
477,THE ROSE,"And you should lightly laugh and lightly say,"
478,THE ROSE,"""That was a rose I gave you--nothing more."""

488,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,All that I know of love I guess
489,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,But from another's happiness.
490,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,
491,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,"A beggar at the window I,"
492,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,"Who, famished, looks on revelry;"

496,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,My granddam told me once of one
497,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,"Whom all her village spat upon,"
498,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,Seeing the church from out its breast
499,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,Had cast him cursed and unconfessed.
500,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,
501,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,An outcast he who dared not take
502,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,"The wafer that God's vicars break,"
503,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,But dull-eyed watched his neighbours pass
504,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,With shining faces from the Mass.
505,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,
506,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,"Oh thou, my brother, take my hand,"
507,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,More than one God hath blessed and banned
508,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,And hidden from man's anguished glance
509,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,The glory of his countenance.
510,THE SONG OF THE YOUNG PAGE,

525,THE NEW SPRING,Should start dead roses blossoming;
526,THE NEW SPRING,Old roses that have lain full long
527,THE NEW SPRING,"In some forgotten book of song,"
528,THE NEW SPRING,Brought from their darkness to be one
529,THE NEW SPRING,With lilting winds and rain and sun;
530,THE NEW SPRING,And as they too might bring away
531,THE NEW SPRING,From that dim volume where they lay
532,THE NEW SPRING,"Some lyric hint, some song's perfume"
533,THE NEW SPRING,"To add its beauty to their bloom,"
534,THE NEW SPRING,So love awakes her heart that lies
535,THE NEW SPRING,"Shrouded in fragrant memories,"

537,THE NEW SPRING,Sweeter for that old sorrow's sake.
