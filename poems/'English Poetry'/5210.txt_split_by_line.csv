37,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
38,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,
39,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The Difficulty of describing Town Scenery--A Comparison with certain
40,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Views in the Country--The River and Quay--The Shipping and Business-
41,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,-Shipbuilding--Sea-Boys and Port-Views--Village and Town Scenery
42,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"again compared--Walks from Town--Cottage and adjoining Heath, &c.--"

44,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Shipwreck at Night, and its Effects on Shore--Evening Amusements in"
45,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,the Borough--An Apology for the imperfect View which can be given of
46,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,these Subjects.
47,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,
48,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"""DESCRIBE the Borough""--though our idle tribe"
49,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"May love description, can we so describe,"
50,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"That you shall fairly streets and buildings trace,"
51,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And all that gives distinction to a place?
52,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,This cannot be; yet moved by your request
53,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,A part I paint--let Fancy form the rest.
54,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Cities and towns, the various haunts of men,"
55,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Require the pencil; they defy the pen:
56,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Could he who sang so well the Grecian fleet,"
57,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"So well have sung of alley, lane, or street?"
58,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Can measured lines these various buildings show,"
59,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"The Town-Hall Turning, or the Prospect Row?"
60,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Can I the seats of wealth and want explore,"
61,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And lengthen out my lays from door to door?
62,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Then let thy Fancy aid me--I repair
63,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"From this tall mansion of our last year's Mayor,"
64,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Till we the outskirts of the Borough reach,"
65,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And these half-buried buildings next the beach,"
66,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Where hang at open doors the net and cork,"
67,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,While squalid sea-dames mend the meshy work;
68,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Till comes the hour when fishing through the tide
69,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The weary husband throws his freight aside;
70,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"A living mass which now demands the wife,"
71,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Th' alternate labours of their humble life.
72,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Can scenes like these withdraw thee from thy wood,"
73,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Thy upland forest, or thy valley's flood?"
74,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Seek then thy garden's shrubby bound, and look,"
75,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"As it steals by, upon the bordering brook;"
76,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"That winding streamlet, limpid, lingering slow,"
77,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Where the reeds whisper when the zephyrs blow;
78,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Where in the midst, upon a throne of green,"
79,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Sits the large Lily as the water's queen;
80,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And makes the current, forced awhile to stay,"
81,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Murmur and bubble as it shoots away;
82,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Draw then the strongest contrast to that stream,"
83,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And our broad river will before thee seem.
84,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"With ceaseless motion comes and goes the tide,"
85,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Flowing, it fills the channel vast and wide;"
86,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Then back to sea, with strong majestic sweep"
87,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"It rolls, in ebb yet terrible and deep;"
88,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Here Samphire-banks and Saltwort bound the flood,"
89,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,There stakes and sea-weeds withering on the mud;
90,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And higher up, a ridge of all things base,"
91,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Which some strong tide has roll'd upon the place.
92,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Thy gentle river boasts its pigmy boat,"
93,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Urged on by pains, half-grounded, half afloat:"
94,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"While at her stern an angler takes his stand,"
95,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And marks the fish he purposes to land;
96,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"From that clear space, where, in the cheerful ray"
97,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Of the warm sun, the scaly people play."
98,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Far other craft our prouder river shows,"
99,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Hoys, pinks, and sloops:  brigs, brigantines, and snows:"
100,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Nor angler we on our wide stream descry,"
101,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,But one poor dredger where his oysters lie:
102,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"He, cold and wet, and driving with the tide,"
103,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Beats his weak arms against his tarry side,"
104,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Then drains the remnant of diluted gin,"
105,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,To aid the warmth that languishes within;
106,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Renewing oft his poor attempts to beat
107,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,His tingling fingers into gathering heat.
108,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"He shall again be seen when evening comes,"
109,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And social parties crowd their favourite rooms:
110,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Where on the table pipes and papers lie,"
111,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The steaming bowl or foaming tankard by;
112,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"'Tis then, with all these comforts spread around,"
113,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,They hear the painful dredger's welcome sound;
114,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And few themselves the savoury boon deny,"
115,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"The food that feeds, the living luxury."
116,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Yon is our Quay! those smaller hoys from town,"
117,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Its various ware, for country use, bring down;"
118,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Those laden waggons, in return, impart"
119,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The country-produce to the city mart;
120,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Hark! to the clamour in that miry road,"
121,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Bounded and narrow'd by yon vessel's load;
122,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"The lumbering wealth she empties round the place,"
123,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Package, and parcel, hogshead, chest, and case:"
124,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"While the loud seaman and the angry hind,"
125,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Mingling in business, bellow to the wind."
126,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Near these a crew amphibious, in the docks,"
127,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Rear, for the sea, those castles on the stocks:"
128,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"See! the long keel, which soon the waves must hide;"
129,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,See! the strong ribs which form the roomy side;
130,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Bolts yielding slowly to the sturdiest stroke,"
131,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And planks which curve and crackle in the smoke.
132,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Around the whole rise cloudy wreaths, and far"
133,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Bear the warm pungence of o'er-boiling tar.
134,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Dabbling on shore half-naked sea-boys crowd,"
135,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Swim round a ship, or swing upon the shroud;"
136,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Or in a boat purloin'd, with paddles play,"
137,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And grow familiar with the watery way:
138,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Young though they be, they feel whose sons they are,"
139,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,They know what British seamen do and dare;
140,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Proud of that fame, they raise and they enjoy"
141,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The rustic wonder of the village-boy.
142,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Before you bid these busy scenes adieu,"
143,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Behold the wealth that lies in public view,"
144,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Those far extended heaps of coal and coke,"
145,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Where fresh-fill'd lime-kilns breathe their stifling smoke.
146,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"This shall pass off, and you behold, instead,"
147,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The night-fire gleaming on its chalky bed;
148,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"When from the Lighthouse brighter beams will rise,"
149,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,To show the shipman where the shallow lies.
150,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Thy walks are ever pleasant; every scene
151,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Is rich in beauty, lively, or serene -"
152,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Rich is that varied view with woods around,"
153,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Seen from the seat within the shrubb'ry bound;
154,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Where shines the distant lake, and where appear"
155,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"From ruins bolting, unmolested deer;"
156,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Lively the village-green, the inn, the place,"
157,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Where the good widow schools her infant-race.
158,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Shops, whence are heard the hammer and the saw,"
159,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And village-pleasures unreproved by law:
160,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Then how serene! when in your favourite room,"
161,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Gales from your jasmines soothe the evening gloom;
162,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"When from your upland paddock you look down,"
163,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And just perceive the smoke which hides the town;
164,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,When weary peasants at the close of day
165,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Walk to their cots, and part upon the way;"
166,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"When cattle slowly cross the shallow brook,"
167,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And shepherds pen their folds, and rest upon their crook."
168,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"We prune our hedges, prime our slender trees,"
169,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And nothing looks untutor'd and at ease,"
170,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"On the wide heath, or in the flowery vale,"
171,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,We scent the vapours of the sea-born gale;
172,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Broad-beaten paths lead on from stile to stile,"
173,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And sewers from streets the road-side banks defile;
174,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Our guarded fields a sense of danger show,"
175,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Where garden-crops with corn and clover grow;
176,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Fences are form'd of wreck, and placed around,"
177,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,(With tenters tipp'd) a strong repulsive bound;
178,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Wide and deep ditches by the gardens run,"
179,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And there in ambush lie the trap and gun;
180,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Or yon broad board, which guards each tempting prize,"
181,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"""Like a tall bully, lifts its head and lies."""
182,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"There stands a cottage with an open door,"
183,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Its garden undefended blooms before:
184,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Her wheel is still, and overturn'd her stool,"
185,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,While the lone Widow seeks the neighb'ring pool:
186,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"This gives us hope, all views of town to shun -"
187,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,No! here are tokens of the Sailor-son;
188,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"That old blue jacket, and that shirt of check,"
189,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And silken kerchief for the seaman's neck;
190,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Sea-spoils and shells from many a distant shore,"
191,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And furry robe from frozen Labrador.
192,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Our busy streets and sylvan-walks between,"
193,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Fen, marshes, bog, and heath all intervene;"
194,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Here pits of crag, with spongy, plashy base,"
195,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,To some enrich th' uncultivated space:
196,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"For there are blossoms rare, and curious rush,"
197,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"The gale's rich balm, and sun-dew's crimson blush,"
198,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Whose velvet leaf with radiant beauty dress'd,"
199,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Forms a gay pillow for the plover's breast.
200,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Not distant far, a house commodious made,"
201,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,(Lonely yet public stands) for Sunday-trade;
202,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Thither, for this day free, gay parties go,"
203,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Their tea-house walk, their tippling rendezvous;"
204,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"There humble couples sit in corner-bowers,"
205,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Or gaily ramble for th' allotted hours;
206,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Sailors and lasses from the town attend,"
207,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"The servant-lover, the apprentice-friend;"
208,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,With all the idle social tribes who seek
209,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And find their humble pleasures once a week.
210,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Turn to the watery world!--but who to thee
211,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,(A wonder yet unview'd) shall paint--the Sea?
212,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Various and vast, sublime in all its forms,"
213,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"When lull'd by zephyrs, or when roused by storms,"
214,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Its colours changing, when from clouds and sun"
215,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Shades after shades upon the surface run;
216,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Embrown'd and horrid now, and now serene,"
217,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"In limpid blue, and evanescent green;"
218,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And oft the foggy banks on ocean lie,"
219,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Lift the fair sail, and cheat th' experienced eye."
220,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Be it the summer--noon:  a sandy space
221,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The ebbing tide has left upon its place;
222,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Then just the hot and stony beach above,"
223,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Light twinkling streams in bright confusion move;
224,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"(For heated thus, the warmer air ascends,"
225,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And with the cooler in its fall contends)
226,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Then the broad bosom of the ocean keeps
227,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"An equal motion; swelling as it sleeps,"
228,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Then slowly sinking; curling to the strand,"
229,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Faint, lazy waves o'ercreep the rigid sand,"
230,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Or tap the tarry boat with gentle blow,"
231,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And back return in silence, smooth and slow."
232,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Ships in the calm seem anchor'd; for they glide
233,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"On the still sea, urged solely by the tide:"
234,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Art thou not present, this calm scene before,"
235,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Where all beside is pebbly length of shore,"
236,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And far as eye can reach, it can discern no more?"
237,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Yet sometimes comes a ruffing cloud to make
238,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The quiet surface of the ocean shake;
239,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,As an awaken'd giant with a frown
240,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Might show his wrath, and then to sleep sink down."
241,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"View now the Winter-storm! above, one cloud,"
242,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Black and unbroken, all the skies o'ershroud:"
243,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Th' unwieldy porpoise through the day before
244,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Had roll'd in view of boding men on shore;
245,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And sometimes hid and sometimes show'd his form,"
246,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Dark as the cloud, and furious as the storm."
247,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"All where the eye delights, yet dreads to roam,"
248,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The breaking billows cast the flying foam
249,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Upon the billows rising--all the deep
250,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Is restless change; the waves so swell'd and steep,"
251,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Breaking and sinking, and the sunken swells,"
252,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Nor one, one moment, in its station dwells:"
253,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"But nearer land you may the billows trace,"
254,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,As if contending in their watery chase;
255,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"May watch the mightiest till the shoal they reach,"
256,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Then break and hurry to their utmost stretch;
257,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Curl'd as they come, they strike with furious force,"
258,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And then re-flowing, take their grating course,"
259,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Raking the rounded flints, which ages past"
260,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Roll'd by their rage, and shall to ages last."
261,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Far off the Petrel in the troubled way
262,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Swims with her brood, or flutters in the spray;"
263,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"She rises often, often drops again,"
264,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And sports at ease on the tempestuous main.
265,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"High o'er the restless deep, above the reach"
266,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Of gunner's hope, vast flights of Wild-ducks stretch;"
267,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Far as the eye can glance on either side,"
268,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,In a broad space and level line they glide;
269,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"All in their wedge-like figures from the north,"
270,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Day after day, flight after flight, go forth."
271,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"In-shore their passage tribes of Sea-gulls urge,"
272,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And drop for prey within the sweeping surge;
273,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Oft in the rough opposing blast they fly
274,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Far back, then turn, and all their force apply,"
275,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,While to the storm they give their weak complaining cry;
276,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Or clap the sleek white pinion to the breast,"
277,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And in the restless ocean dip for rest.
278,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Darkness begins to reign; the louder wind
279,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Appals the weak and awes the firmer mind;
280,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,But frights not him whom evening and the spray
281,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,In part conceal--yon Prowler on his way:
282,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Lo! he has something seen; he runs apace,"
283,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,As if he fear'd companion in the chase;
284,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"He sees his prize, and now he turns again,"
285,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Slowly and sorrowing--""Was your search in vain?"""
286,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Gruffly he answers, ""'Tis a sorry sight!"
287,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"A seaman's body:  there'll be more to-night!"""
288,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Hark! to those sounds! they're from distress at sea;
289,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,How quick they come! What terrors may there be!
290,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Yes, 'tis a driven vessel:  I discern"
291,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Lights, signs of terror, gleaming from the stern;"
292,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Others behold them too, and from the town"
293,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,In various parties seamen hurry down;
294,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Their wives pursue, and damsels urged by dread,"
295,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Lest men so dear be into danger led;
296,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Their head the gown has hooded, and their call"
297,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,In this sad night is piercing like the squall;
298,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"They feel their kinds of power, and when they meet,"
299,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Chide, fondle, weep, dare, threaten, or entreat."
300,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"See one poor girl, all terror and alarm,"
301,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Has fondly seized upon her lover's arm;
302,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"""Thou shalt not venture;"" and he answers ""No!"
303,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"I will not:""--still she cries, ""Thou shalt not go."""
304,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,No need of this; not here the stoutest boat
305,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Can through such breakers, o'er such billows float,"
306,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Yet may they view these lights upon the beach,"
307,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Which yield them hope whom help can never reach.
308,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,From parted clouds the moon her radiance throws
309,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"On the wild waves, and all the danger shows;"
310,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"But shows them beaming in her shining vest,"
311,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Terrific splendour! gloom in glory dress'd!
312,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"This for a moment, and then clouds again"
313,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Hide every beam, and fear and darkness reign."
314,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,But hear we not those sounds?  Do lights appear?
315,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,I see them not! the storm alone I hear:
316,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And lo! the sailors homeward take their way;
317,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Man must endure--let us submit and pray.
318,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Such are our Winter-views:  but night comes on -
319,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Now business sleeps, and daily cares are gone;"
320,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Now parties form, and some their friends assist"
321,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,To waste the idle hours at sober whist;
322,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The tavern's pleasure or the concert's charm
323,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Unnumber'd moments of their sting disarm:
324,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Play-bills and open doors a crowd invite,"
325,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,To pass off one dread portion of the night;
326,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"And show and song and luxury combined,"
327,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Lift off from man this burthen of mankind.
328,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Others advent'rous walk abroad and meet
329,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Returning parties pacing through the street,"
330,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"When various voices, in the dying day,"
331,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Hum in our walks, and greet us in our way;"
332,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"When tavern-lights flit on from room to room,"
333,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And guide the tippling sailor staggering home:
334,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"There as we pass, the jingling bells betray"
335,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,How business rises with the closing day:
336,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Now walking silent, by the river's side,"
337,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The ear perceives the rippling of the tide;
338,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,Or measured cadence of the lads who tow
339,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Some entered hoy, to fix her in her row;"
340,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Or hollow sound, which from the parish-bell"
341,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,To some departed spirit bids farewell!
342,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Thus shall you something of our BOROUGH know,"
343,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Far as a verse, with Fancy's aid, can show."
344,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Of Sea or River, of a Quay or Street,"
345,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,The best description must be incomplete;
346,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"But when a happier theme succeeds, and when"
347,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Men are our subjects and the deeds of men,"
348,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,"Then may we find the Muse in happier style,"
349,GENERAL DESCRIPTION.,And we may sometimes sigh and sometimes smile.

419,THE CHURCH.,Which pleased distinctly in their place before.
420,THE CHURCH.,"But ere you enter, yon bold tower survey,"
421,THE CHURCH.,"Tall and entire, and venerably gray,"
422,THE CHURCH.,"For time has soften'd what was harsh when new,"
423,THE CHURCH.,And now the stains are all of sober hue;
424,THE CHURCH.,"The living stains which Nature's hand alone,"
425,THE CHURCH.,"Profuse of life, pours forth upon the stone:"
426,THE CHURCH.,For ever growing; where the common eye
427,THE CHURCH.,Can but the bare and rocky bed descry;
428,THE CHURCH.,"There Science loves to trace her tribes minute,"
429,THE CHURCH.,"The juiceless foliage, and the tasteless fruit;"
430,THE CHURCH.,"There she perceives them round the surface creep,"
431,THE CHURCH.,And while they meet their due distinction keep;
432,THE CHURCH.,"Mix'd but not blended; each its name retains,"
433,THE CHURCH.,And these are Nature's ever-during stains.
434,THE CHURCH.,"And wouldst thou, Artist! with thy tints and brush,"
435,THE CHURCH.,"Form shades like these?  Pretender, where thy blush?"
436,THE CHURCH.,In three short hours shall thy presuming hand
437,THE CHURCH.,Th' effect of three slow centuries command?
438,THE CHURCH.,Thou may'st thy various greens and grays contrive;
439,THE CHURCH.,"They are not Lichens, nor like ought alive;-"
440,THE CHURCH.,"But yet proceed, and when thy tints are lost,"
441,THE CHURCH.,"Fled in the shower, or crumbled by the frost;"
442,THE CHURCH.,When all thy work is done away as clean
443,THE CHURCH.,As if thou never spread'st thy gray and green;
444,THE CHURCH.,"Then may'st thou see how Nature's work is done,"
445,THE CHURCH.,How slowly true she lays her colours on;
446,THE CHURCH.,When her least speck upon the hardest flint
447,THE CHURCH.,"Has mark and form, and is a living tint;"
448,THE CHURCH.,"And so embodied with the rock, that few"
449,THE CHURCH.,Can the small germ upon the substance view.
450,THE CHURCH.,"Seeds, to our eyes invisible, will find"
451,THE CHURCH.,On the rude rock the bed that fits their kind;
452,THE CHURCH.,"There, in the rugged soil, they safely dwell,"
453,THE CHURCH.,"Till showers and snows the subtle atoms swell,"
454,THE CHURCH.,And spread th' enduring foliage;--then we trace
455,THE CHURCH.,The freckled flower upon the flinty base;
456,THE CHURCH.,"These all increase, till in unnoticed years"
457,THE CHURCH.,The stony tower as gray with age appears;
458,THE CHURCH.,"With coats of vegetation, thinly spread,"
459,THE CHURCH.,"Coat above coat, the living on the dead;"
460,THE CHURCH.,"These then dissolve to dust, and make a way"
461,THE CHURCH.,"For bolder foliage, nursed by their decay:"
462,THE CHURCH.,The long-enduring Ferns in time will all
463,THE CHURCH.,Die and depose their dust upon the wall;
464,THE CHURCH.,"Where the wing'd seed may rest, till many a flower"
465,THE CHURCH.,Show Flora's triumph o'er the falling tower.
466,THE CHURCH.,"But ours yet stands, and has its Bells renown'd"
467,THE CHURCH.,For size magnificent and solemn sound;
468,THE CHURCH.,"Each has its motto:  some contrived to tell,"
469,THE CHURCH.,"In monkish rhyme, the uses of a bell;"
470,THE CHURCH.,"Such wond'rous good, as few conceive could spring"
471,THE CHURCH.,From ten loud coppers when their clampers swing.
472,THE CHURCH.,"Enter'd the Church--we to a tomb proceed,"
473,THE CHURCH.,Whose names and titles few attempt to read;
474,THE CHURCH.,"Old English letters, and those half pick'd out,"
475,THE CHURCH.,"Leave us, unskilful readers, much in doubt;"
476,THE CHURCH.,Our sons shall see its more degraded state;
477,THE CHURCH.,The tomb of grandeur hastens to its fate;
478,THE CHURCH.,"That marble arch, our sexton's favourite show,"
479,THE CHURCH.,With all those ruff'd and painted pairs below;
480,THE CHURCH.,The noble Lady and the Lord who rest
481,THE CHURCH.,"Supine, as courtly dame and warrior drest;"
482,THE CHURCH.,"All are departed from their state sublime,"
483,THE CHURCH.,"Mangled and wounded in their war with Time,"
484,THE CHURCH.,"Colleagued with mischief:  here a leg is fled,"
485,THE CHURCH.,And lo! the Baron with but half a head:
486,THE CHURCH.,Midway is cleft the arch; the very base
487,THE CHURCH.,Is batter'd round and shifted from its place.
488,THE CHURCH.,"Wonder not, Mortal, at thy quick decay -"
489,THE CHURCH.,See! men of marble piecemeal melt away;
490,THE CHURCH.,"When whose the image we no longer read,"
491,THE CHURCH.,But monuments themselves memorials need.
492,THE CHURCH.,"With few such stately proofs of grief or pride,"
493,THE CHURCH.,"By wealth erected, is our Church supplied;"
494,THE CHURCH.,"But we have mural tablets, every size,"
495,THE CHURCH.,"That woe could wish, or vanity devise."
496,THE CHURCH.,"Death levels man--the wicked and the just,"
497,THE CHURCH.,"The wise, the weak, lie blended in the dust;"
498,THE CHURCH.,"And by the honours dealt to every name,"
499,THE CHURCH.,The King of Terrors seems to level fame.
500,THE CHURCH.,"- See! here lamented wives, and every wife"
501,THE CHURCH.,The pride and comfort of her husband's life;
502,THE CHURCH.,"Here, to her spouse, with every virtue graced,"
503,THE CHURCH.,His mournful widow has a trophy placed;
504,THE CHURCH.,"And here 'tis doubtful if the duteous son,"
505,THE CHURCH.,"Or the good father, be in praise outdone."
506,THE CHURCH.,"This may be Nature:  when our friends we lose,"
507,THE CHURCH.,Our alter'd feelings alter too our views;
508,THE CHURCH.,"What in their tempers teased us or distress'd,"
509,THE CHURCH.,"Is, with our anger and the dead, at rest;"
510,THE CHURCH.,"And much we grieve, no longer trial made,"
511,THE CHURCH.,For that impatience which we then display'd;
512,THE CHURCH.,Now to their love and worth of every kind
513,THE CHURCH.,A soft compunction turns th' afflicted mind;
514,THE CHURCH.,"Virtues neglected then, adored become,"
515,THE CHURCH.,"And graces slighted, blossom on the tomb."
516,THE CHURCH.,'Tis well; but let not love nor grief believe
517,THE CHURCH.,That we assent (who neither loved nor grieve)
518,THE CHURCH.,"To all that praise which on the tomb is read,"
519,THE CHURCH.,To all that passion dictates for the dead;
520,THE CHURCH.,"But more indignant, we the tomb deride,"
521,THE CHURCH.,Whose bold inscription flattery sells to pride.
522,THE CHURCH.,Read of this Burgess--on the stone appear
523,THE CHURCH.,How worthy he! how virtuous! and how dear!
524,THE CHURCH.,"What wailing was there when his spirit fled,"
525,THE CHURCH.,"How mourned his lady for her lord when dead,"
526,THE CHURCH.,And tears abundant through the town were shed;
527,THE CHURCH.,"See! he was liberal, kind, religious, wise,"
528,THE CHURCH.,And free from all disgrace and all disguise;
529,THE CHURCH.,"His sterling worth, which words cannot express,"
530,THE CHURCH.,"Lives with his friends, their pride and their distress."
531,THE CHURCH.,All this of Jacob Holmes? for his the name:
532,THE CHURCH.,"He thus kind, liberal, just, religious?--Shame!"
533,THE CHURCH.,What is the truth?  Old Jacob married thrice;
534,THE CHURCH.,"He dealt in coals, and av'rice was his vice;"
535,THE CHURCH.,"He ruled the Borough when his year came on,"
536,THE CHURCH.,"And some forget, and some are glad he's gone;"
537,THE CHURCH.,"For never yet with shilling could he part,"
538,THE CHURCH.,But when it left his hand it struck his heart.
539,THE CHURCH.,"Yet, here will Love its last attentions pay,"
540,THE CHURCH.,And place memorials on these beds of clay;
541,THE CHURCH.,"Large level stones lie flat upon the grave,"
542,THE CHURCH.,And half a century's sun and tempest brave;
543,THE CHURCH.,But many an honest tear and heartfelt sigh
544,THE CHURCH.,Have follow'd those who now unnoticed lie;
545,THE CHURCH.,Of these what numbers rest on every side!
546,THE CHURCH.,Without one token left by grief or pride;
547,THE CHURCH.,"Their graves soon levell'd to the earth, and then"
548,THE CHURCH.,Will other hillocks rise o'er other men;
549,THE CHURCH.,"Daily the dead on the decay'd are thrust,"
550,THE CHURCH.,"And generations follow, ""dust to dust."""
551,THE CHURCH.,Yes! there are real Mourners--I have seen
552,THE CHURCH.,"A fair, sad Girl, mild, suffering, and serene;"
553,THE CHURCH.,"Attention (through the day) her duties claim'd,"
554,THE CHURCH.,And to be useful as resign'd she aim'd:
555,THE CHURCH.,"Neatly she dress'd, nor vainly seem'd t'expect"
556,THE CHURCH.,"Pity for grief, or pardon for neglect;"
557,THE CHURCH.,"But when her wearied parents sunk to sleep,"
558,THE CHURCH.,She sought her place to meditate and weep:
559,THE CHURCH.,"Then to her mind was all the past display'd,"
560,THE CHURCH.,That faithful Memory brings to Sorrow's aid;
561,THE CHURCH.,"For then she thought on one regretted Youth,"
562,THE CHURCH.,"Her tender trust, and his unquestioned truth;"
563,THE CHURCH.,"In ev'ry place she wander'd, where they'd been,"
564,THE CHURCH.,And sadly sacred held the parting scene;
565,THE CHURCH.,Where last for sea he took his leave--that place
566,THE CHURCH.,With double interest would she nightly trace;
567,THE CHURCH.,"For long the courtship was, and he would say,"
568,THE CHURCH.,"Each time he sail'd,--""This once, and then the day:"
569,THE CHURCH.,"Yet prudence tarried, but when last he went,"
570,THE CHURCH.,He drew from pitying love a full consent.
571,THE CHURCH.,"Happy he sail'd, and great the care she took"
572,THE CHURCH.,That he should softly sleep and smartly look;
573,THE CHURCH.,"White was his better linen, and his check"
574,THE CHURCH.,Was made more trim than any on the deck;
575,THE CHURCH.,And every comfort men at sea can know
576,THE CHURCH.,"Was hers to buy, to make, and to bestow?"
577,THE CHURCH.,"For he to Greenland sail'd, and much she told"
578,THE CHURCH.,How he should guard against the climate's cold;
579,THE CHURCH.,"Yet saw not danger; dangers he'd withstood,"
580,THE CHURCH.,Nor could she trace the fever in his blood:
581,THE CHURCH.,"His messmates smiled at flushings in his cheek,"
582,THE CHURCH.,"And he too smiled, but seldom would he speak;"
583,THE CHURCH.,"For now he found the danger, felt the pain,"
584,THE CHURCH.,With grievous symptoms he could not explain;
585,THE CHURCH.,"Hope was awaken'd, as for home he sail'd,"
586,THE CHURCH.,"But quickly sank, and never more prevail'd."
587,THE CHURCH.,"He call'd his friend, and prefaced with a sigh"
588,THE CHURCH.,"A lover's message--""Thomas, I must die:"
589,THE CHURCH.,"Would I could see my Sally, and could rest"
590,THE CHURCH.,"My throbbing temples on her faithful breast,"
591,THE CHURCH.,"And gazing go!--if not, this trifle take,"
592,THE CHURCH.,"And say, till death I wore it for her sake:"
593,THE CHURCH.,"Yes! I must die--blow on, sweet breeze, blow on!"
594,THE CHURCH.,"Give me one look before my life be gone,"
595,THE CHURCH.,"Oh! give me that, and let me not despair,"
596,THE CHURCH.,"One last fond look--and now repeat the prayer."""
597,THE CHURCH.,"He had his wish, had more:  I will not paint"
598,THE CHURCH.,"The Lovers' meeting:  she beheld him faint, -"
599,THE CHURCH.,"With tender fears, she took a nearer view,"
600,THE CHURCH.,Her terrors doubling as her hopes withdrew;
601,THE CHURCH.,"He tried to smile, and, half succeeding, said,"
602,THE CHURCH.,"""Yes! I must die;"" and hope for ever fled."
603,THE CHURCH.,Still long she nursed him:  tender thoughts meantime
604,THE CHURCH.,"Were interchanged, and hopes and views sublime:"
605,THE CHURCH.,"To her he came to die, and every day"
606,THE CHURCH.,She took some portion of the dread away;
607,THE CHURCH.,"With him she pray'd, to him his Bible read,"
608,THE CHURCH.,"Soothed the faint heart, and held the aching head:"
609,THE CHURCH.,She came with smiles the hour of pain to cheer:
610,THE CHURCH.,"Apart she sigh'd; alone, she shed the tear:"
611,THE CHURCH.,"Then as if breaking from a cloud, she gave"
612,THE CHURCH.,"Fresh light, and gilt the prospect of the grave."
613,THE CHURCH.,"One day he lighter seemed, and they forgot"
614,THE CHURCH.,"The care, the dread, the anguish of their lot;"
615,THE CHURCH.,"They spoke with cheerfulness, and seem'd to think,"
616,THE CHURCH.,"Yet said not so--""Perhaps he will not sink:"""
617,THE CHURCH.,"A sudden brightness in his look appear'd,"
618,THE CHURCH.,"A sudden vigour in his voice was heard, -"
619,THE CHURCH.,"She had been reading in the Book of Prayer,"
620,THE CHURCH.,"And led him forth, and placed him in his chair;"
621,THE CHURCH.,"Lively he seem'd, and spoke of all he knew,"
622,THE CHURCH.,"The friendly many, and the favourite few;"
623,THE CHURCH.,Nor one that day did he to mind recall
624,THE CHURCH.,"But she has treasured, and she loves them all:"
625,THE CHURCH.,"When in her way she meets them, they appear"
626,THE CHURCH.,Peculiar people--death has made them dear.
627,THE CHURCH.,"He named his Friend, but then his hand she press'd,"
628,THE CHURCH.,"And fondly whisper'd, ""Thou must go to rest;"""
629,THE CHURCH.,"""I go,"" he said:  but as he spoke, she found"
630,THE CHURCH.,"His hand more cold, and fluttering was the sound!"
631,THE CHURCH.,"Then gazed affrighten'd; but she caught a last,"
632,THE CHURCH.,"A dying look of love,--and all was past!"
633,THE CHURCH.,"She placed a decent stone his grave above,"
634,THE CHURCH.,Neatly engraved--an offering of her love;
635,THE CHURCH.,"For that she wrought, for that forsook her bed,"
636,THE CHURCH.,Awake alike to duty and the dead;
637,THE CHURCH.,"She would have grieved, had friends presum'd to spare"
638,THE CHURCH.,The least assistance--'twas her proper care.
639,THE CHURCH.,"Here will she come, and on the grave will sit,"
640,THE CHURCH.,"Folding her arms, in long abstracted fit;"
641,THE CHURCH.,"But if observer pass, will take her round,"
642,THE CHURCH.,"And careless seem, for she would not be found;"
643,THE CHURCH.,"Then go again, and thus her hour employ,"
644,THE CHURCH.,"While visions please her, and while woes destroy."
645,THE CHURCH.,"Forbear, sweet Maid! nor be by Fancy led,"
646,THE CHURCH.,To hold mysterious converse with the dead;
647,THE CHURCH.,"For sure at length thy thoughts, thy spirit's pain,"
648,THE CHURCH.,In this sad conflict will disturb thy brain;
649,THE CHURCH.,"All have their tasks and trials; thine are hard,"
650,THE CHURCH.,"But short the time, and glorious the reward;"
651,THE CHURCH.,"Thy patient spirit to thy duties give,"
652,THE CHURCH.,"Regard the dead, but to the living live."

698,THE VICAR.,"Of most, all mention, memory, thought are past -"
699,THE VICAR.,But take a slight memorial of the last.
700,THE VICAR.,"To what famed college we our Yicar owe,"
701,THE VICAR.,"To what fair county, let historians show:"
702,THE VICAR.,"Few now remember when the mild young man,"
703,THE VICAR.,"Ruddy and fair, his Sunday-task began;"
704,THE VICAR.,Few live to speak of that soft soothing look
705,THE VICAR.,"He cast around, as he prepared his book;"
706,THE VICAR.,"It was a kind of supplicating smile,"
707,THE VICAR.,But nothing hopeless of applause the while;
708,THE VICAR.,"And when he finished, his corrected pride"
709,THE VICAR.,"Felt the desert, and yet the praise denied."
710,THE VICAR.,"Thus he his race began, and to the end"
711,THE VICAR.,"His constant care was, no man to offend;"
712,THE VICAR.,No haughty virtues stirr'd his peaceful mind;
713,THE VICAR.,Nor urged the Priest to leave the Flock behind;
714,THE VICAR.,"He was his Master's Soldier, but not one"
715,THE VICAR.,To lead an army of his Martyrs on:
716,THE VICAR.,"Fear was his ruling passion; yet was Love,"
717,THE VICAR.,"Of timid kind, once known his heart to move;"
718,THE VICAR.,It led his patient spirit where it paid
719,THE VICAR.,Its languid offerings to a listening Maid:
720,THE VICAR.,"She, with her widow'd Mother, heard him speak,"
721,THE VICAR.,And sought awhile to find what he would seek:
722,THE VICAR.,"Smiling he came, he smiled when he withdrew,"
723,THE VICAR.,And paid the same attention to the two;
724,THE VICAR.,"Meeting and parting without joy or pain,"
725,THE VICAR.,He seem'd to come that he might go again.
726,THE VICAR.,"The wondering girl, no prude, but something nice,"
727,THE VICAR.,At length was chill'd by his unmelting ice;
728,THE VICAR.,"She found her tortoise held such sluggish pace,"

730,THE VICAR.,"This not approving, she withdrew, till one"
731,THE VICAR.,Came who appear'd with livelier hope to run;
732,THE VICAR.,"Who sought a readier way the heart to move,"
733,THE VICAR.,Than by faint dalliance of unfixing love.
734,THE VICAR.,Accuse me not that I approving paint

742,THE VICAR.,The married dame in vain assail'd the truth

746,THE VICAR.,"But Joseph's fame had lessened in our view,"
747,THE VICAR.,"Had he, refusing, fled the maiden too."
748,THE VICAR.,"Yet our good priest to Joseph's praise aspired,"
749,THE VICAR.,As once rejecting what his heart desired;
750,THE VICAR.,"""I am escaped,"" he said, when none pursued;"
751,THE VICAR.,"When none attack'd him, ""I am unsubdued;"""
752,THE VICAR.,"""Oh pleasing pangs of love!"" he sang again,"
753,THE VICAR.,"Cold to the joy, and stranger to the pain."
754,THE VICAR.,"E'en in his age would he address the young,"
755,THE VICAR.,"""I too have felt these fires, and they are strong;"""
756,THE VICAR.,"But from the time he left his favourite maid,"
757,THE VICAR.,To ancient females his devoirs were paid:
758,THE VICAR.,And still they miss him after Morning-prayer;

768,THE VICAR.,"If the vast world may not some scene produce,"
769,THE VICAR.,Some state where your small talents might have use;
770,THE VICAR.,"Within seraglios you might harmless move,"
771,THE VICAR.,"'Mid ranks of beauty, and in haunts of love;"
772,THE VICAR.,"There from too daring man the treasures guard,"
773,THE VICAR.,"An easy duty, and its own reward;"
774,THE VICAR.,"Nature's soft substitutes, you there might save"
775,THE VICAR.,"From crime the tyrant, and from wrong the slave."
776,THE VICAR.,"But let applause be dealt in all we may,"
777,THE VICAR.,"Our Priest was cheerful, and in season gay;"
778,THE VICAR.,His frequent visits seldom fail'd to please;
779,THE VICAR.,"Easy himself, he sought his neighbour's ease:"
780,THE VICAR.,"To a small garden with delight he came,"
781,THE VICAR.,And gave successive flowers a summer's fame;
782,THE VICAR.,"These he presented, with a grace his own,"
783,THE VICAR.,"To his fair friends, and made their beauties known,"
784,THE VICAR.,Not without moral compliment; how they
785,THE VICAR.,"""Like flowers were sweet, and must like flowers decay.'"
786,THE VICAR.,"Simple he was, and loved the simple truth,"
787,THE VICAR.,Yet had some useful cunning from his youth;
788,THE VICAR.,"A cunning never to dishonour lent,"
789,THE VICAR.,And rather for defence than conquest meant;
790,THE VICAR.,"'Twas fear of power, with some desire to rise,"
791,THE VICAR.,But not enough to make him enemies;
792,THE VICAR.,He ever aim'd to please; and to offend
793,THE VICAR.,Was ever cautious; for he sought a friend;
794,THE VICAR.,"Yet for the friendship never much would pay,"
795,THE VICAR.,"Content to bow, be silent, and obey,"
796,THE VICAR.,And by a soothing suff'rance find his way.
797,THE VICAR.,Fiddling and fishing were his arts:  at times
798,THE VICAR.,"He alter'd sermons, and he aim'd at rhymes;"
799,THE VICAR.,"And his fair friends, not yet intent on cards,"
800,THE VICAR.,Oft he amused with riddles and charades.
801,THE VICAR.,"Mild were his doctrines, and not one discourse"
802,THE VICAR.,But gain'd in softness what it lost in force:
803,THE VICAR.,Kind his opinions; he would not receive
804,THE VICAR.,"An ill report, nor evil act believe;"
805,THE VICAR.,"""If true, 'twas wrong; but blemish great or small"
806,THE VICAR.,"Have all mankind; yea, sinners are we all."""
807,THE VICAR.,"If ever fretful thought disturb'd his breast,"
808,THE VICAR.,"If aught of gloom that cheerful mind oppress'd,"
809,THE VICAR.,It sprang from innovation; it was then
810,THE VICAR.,He spake of mischief made by restless men:
811,THE VICAR.,Not by new doctrines:  never in his life
812,THE VICAR.,Would he attend to controversial strife;
813,THE VICAR.,"For sects he cared not; "" They are not of us,"
814,THE VICAR.,"Nor need we, brethren, their concerns discuss;"
815,THE VICAR.,"But 'tis the change, the schism at home I feel;"
816,THE VICAR.,"Ills few perceive, and none have skill to heal:"
817,THE VICAR.,Not at the altar our young brethren read
818,THE VICAR.,(Facing their flock) the decalogue and creed;
819,THE VICAR.,"But at their duty, in their desks they stand,"
820,THE VICAR.,"With naked surplice, lacking hood and band:"
821,THE VICAR.,"Churches are now of holy song bereft,"
822,THE VICAR.,And half our ancient customs changed or left;
823,THE VICAR.,"Few sprigs of ivy are at Christmas seen,"
824,THE VICAR.,Nor crimson berry tips the holly's green;
825,THE VICAR.,Mistaken choirs refuse the solemn strain
826,THE VICAR.,"Of ancient Sternhold, which from ours amain"
827,THE VICAR.,"Comes flying forth from aisle to aisle about,"
828,THE VICAR.,"Sweet links of harmony and long drawn out."""
829,THE VICAR.,These were to him essentials; all things new
830,THE VICAR.,"He deemed superfluous, useless, or untrue:"
831,THE VICAR.,"To all beside indifferent, easy, cold,"
832,THE VICAR.,"Here the fire kindled, and the woe was told."
833,THE VICAR.,Habit with him was all the test of truth:
834,THE VICAR.,"""It must be right:  I've done it from my youth."""
835,THE VICAR.,Questions he answer'd in as brief a way:
836,THE VICAR.,"""It must be wrong--it was of yesterday."""
837,THE VICAR.,"Though mild benevolence our Priest possess'd,"
838,THE VICAR.,'Twas but by wishes or by words expressed.
839,THE VICAR.,"Circles in water, as they wider flow,"
840,THE VICAR.,"The less conspicuous in their progress grow,"
841,THE VICAR.,"And when at last they touch upon the shore,"
842,THE VICAR.,"Distinction ceases, and they're view'd no more."
843,THE VICAR.,"His love, like that last circle, all embraced,"
844,THE VICAR.,But with effect that never could be traced.
845,THE VICAR.,"Now rests our Vicar. They who knew him best,"
846,THE VICAR.,Proclaim his life t'have been entirely rest;
847,THE VICAR.,Free from all evils which disturb his mind
848,THE VICAR.,Whom studies vex and controversies blind.
849,THE VICAR.,"The rich approved,--of them in awe he stood;"
850,THE VICAR.,"The poor admired,--they all believed him good;"
851,THE VICAR.,The old and serious of his habits spoke;
852,THE VICAR.,The frank and youthful loved his pleasant joke;
853,THE VICAR.,"Mothers approved a safe contented guest,"
854,THE VICAR.,And daughters one who back'd each small request;
855,THE VICAR.,In him his flock found nothing to condemn;
856,THE VICAR.,"Him sectaries liked,--he never troubled them:"
857,THE VICAR.,"No trifles fail'd his yielding mind to please,"
858,THE VICAR.,And all his passions sunk in early ease;
859,THE VICAR.,"Nor one so old has left this world of sin,"
860,THE VICAR.,More like the being that he entered in.
861,THE VICAR.,
862,THE CURATE.,THE CURATE.
863,THE CURATE.,
864,THE CURATE.,ASK you what lands our Pastor tithes?--Alas!
865,THE CURATE.,"But few our acres, and but short our grass:"
866,THE CURATE.,"In some fat pastures of the rich, indeed,"
867,THE CURATE.,May roll the single cow or favourite steed;
868,THE CURATE.,"Who, stable-fed, is here for pleasure seen,"
869,THE CURATE.,His sleek sides bathing in the dewy green;
870,THE CURATE.,"But these, our hilly heath and common wide"
871,THE CURATE.,Yield a slight portion for the parish-guide;
872,THE CURATE.,"No crops luxuriant in our borders stand,"
873,THE CURATE.,"For here we plough the ocean, not the land;"
874,THE CURATE.,"Still reason wills that we our Pastor pay,"
875,THE CURATE.,And custom does it on a certain day:
876,THE CURATE.,"Much is the duty, small the legal due,"
877,THE CURATE.,And this with grateful minds we keep in view;
878,THE CURATE.,"Each makes his off'ring, some by habit led,"
879,THE CURATE.,Some by the thought that all men must be fed;
880,THE CURATE.,"Duty and love, and piety and pride,"
881,THE CURATE.,"Have each their force, and for the Priest provide."
882,THE CURATE.,"Not thus our Curate, one whom all believe"
883,THE CURATE.,"Pious and just, and for whose fate they grieve;"
884,THE CURATE.,"All see him poor, but e'en the vulgar know"
885,THE CURATE.,"He merits love, and their respect bestow."
886,THE CURATE.,"A man so learn'd you shall but seldom see,"
887,THE CURATE.,"Nor one so honour'd, so aggrieved as he; -"
888,THE CURATE.,Not grieved by years alone; though his appear
889,THE CURATE.,Dark and more dark; severer on severe:
890,THE CURATE.,"Not in his need,--and yet we all must grant"
891,THE CURATE.,How painful 'tis for feeling Age to want:
892,THE CURATE.,Nor in his body's sufferings; yet we know
893,THE CURATE.,"Where Time has ploughed, there Misery loves to sow;"
894,THE CURATE.,"But in the wearied mind, that all in vain"
895,THE CURATE.,"Wars with distress, and struggles with its pain."
896,THE CURATE.,"His father saw his powers--""I give,"" quoth he,"
897,THE CURATE.,"""My first-born learning; 'twill a portion be:"""
898,THE CURATE.,Unhappy gift! a portion for a son!
899,THE CURATE.,"But all he had: --he learn'd, and was undone!"

901,THE CURATE.,"Had he the cassock for the priesthood made,"
902,THE CURATE.,"Or thrown the shuttle, or the saddle shaped,"
903,THE CURATE.,And all these pangs of feeling souls escaped.
904,THE CURATE.,"He once had hope--Hope, ardent, lively, light;"
905,THE CURATE.,"His feelings pleasant, and his prospects bright:"
906,THE CURATE.,"Eager of fame, he read, he thought, he wrote,"
907,THE CURATE.,"Weigh'd the Greek page, and added note on note."
908,THE CURATE.,"At morn, at evening, at his work was he,"
909,THE CURATE.,And dream'd what his Euripides would be.
910,THE CURATE.,"Then care began: --he loved, he woo'd, he wed;"
911,THE CURATE.,"Hope cheer'd him still, and Hymen bless'd his bed -"
912,THE CURATE.,A curate's bed ! then came the woeful years;
913,THE CURATE.,"The husband's terrors, and the father's tears;"
914,THE CURATE.,"A wife grown feeble, mourning, pining, vex'd"
915,THE CURATE.,With wants and woes--by daily cares perplex'd;
916,THE CURATE.,"No more a help, a smiling, soothing aid,"
917,THE CURATE.,"But boding, drooping, sickly, and afraid."
918,THE CURATE.,"A kind physician, and without a fee,"
919,THE CURATE.,"Gave his opinion--""Send her to the sea."""
920,THE CURATE.,"""Alas!"" the good man answer'd, ""can I send"
921,THE CURATE.,A friendless woman? Can I find a friend?
922,THE CURATE.,"No; I must with her, in her need, repair"
923,THE CURATE.,To that new place; the poor lie everywhere; -
924,THE CURATE.,"Some priest will pay me for my pious pains:"" -"
925,THE CURATE.,"He said, he came, and here he yet remains."
926,THE CURATE.,"Behold his dwelling! this poor hut he hires,"
927,THE CURATE.,"Where he from view, though not from want, retires;"

929,THE CURATE.,"Partake his sufferings, and dismiss his duns;"
930,THE CURATE.,"All join their efforts, and in patience learn"
931,THE CURATE.,To want the comforts they aspire to earn;
932,THE CURATE.,"For the sick mother something they'd obtain,"
933,THE CURATE.,To soothe her grief and mitigate her pain;
934,THE CURATE.,For the sad father something they'd procure
935,THE CURATE.,To ease the burden they themselves endure.
936,THE CURATE.,Virtues like these at once delight and press
937,THE CURATE.,On the fond father with a proud distress;
938,THE CURATE.,"On all around he looks with care and love,"
939,THE CURATE.,"Grieved to behold, but happy to approve."
940,THE CURATE.,"Then from his care, his love, his grief, he steals,"
941,THE CURATE.,And by himself an Author's pleasure feels:
942,THE CURATE.,"Each line detains him; he omits not one,"
943,THE CURATE.,And all the sorrows of his state are gone. -
944,THE CURATE.,"Alas! even then, in that delicious hour,"
945,THE CURATE.,"He feels his fortune, and laments its power."
946,THE CURATE.,"Some Tradesman's bill his wandering eyes engage,"
947,THE CURATE.,Some scrawl for payment thrust 'twixt page and page;

949,THE CURATE.,"Some surly message he has heard before,"
950,THE CURATE.,"Awake, alarm, and tell him he is poor."
951,THE CURATE.,"An angry Dealer, vulgar, rich, and proud,"
952,THE CURATE.,"Thinks of his bill, and, passing, raps aloud;"
953,THE CURATE.,The elder daughter meekly makes him way -
954,THE CURATE.,"""I want my money, and I cannot stay:"
955,THE CURATE.,"My mill is stopp'd; what, Miss! I cannot grind;"
956,THE CURATE.,"Go tell your father he must raise the wind:"""
957,THE CURATE.,"Still trembling, troubled, the dejected maid"
958,THE CURATE.,"Says, ""Sir! my father!""--and then stops afraid:"
959,THE CURATE.,"E'en his hard heart is soften'd, and he hears"
960,THE CURATE.,Her voice with pity; he respects her tears;
961,THE CURATE.,"His stubborn features half admit a smile,"
962,THE CURATE.,"And his tone softens--""Well! I'll wait awhile."""
963,THE CURATE.,"Pity! a man so good, so mild, so meek,"
964,THE CURATE.,"At such an age, should have his bread to seek;"
965,THE CURATE.,And all those rude and fierce attacks to dread.
966,THE CURATE.,That are more harrowing than the want of bread;
967,THE CURATE.,Ah! who shall whisper to that misery peace!
968,THE CURATE.,And say that want and insolence shall cease?
969,THE CURATE.,"""But why not publish?""--those who know too well,"
970,THE CURATE.,"Dealers in Greek, are fearful 'twill not sell;"

972,THE CURATE.,Nor likes his labours nor his griefs to show;
973,THE CURATE.,"The hope of fame may in his heart have place,"
974,THE CURATE.,But he has dread and horror of disgrace;
975,THE CURATE.,"Nor has he that confiding, easy way,"
976,THE CURATE.,That might his learning and himself display;
977,THE CURATE.,"But to his work he from the world retreats,"
978,THE CURATE.,And frets and glories o'er the favourite sheets.

980,THE CURATE.,Signs of new joy exulting in that face
981,THE CURATE.,"O'er care that sleeps--we err, or we discern"
982,THE CURATE.,Life in thy looks--the reason may we learn?
983,THE CURATE.,"""Yes,"" he replied, ""I'm happy, I confess,"
984,THE CURATE.,To learn that some are pleased with happiness
985,THE CURATE.,Which others feel--there are who now combine
986,THE CURATE.,"The worthiest natures in the best design,"
987,THE CURATE.,"To aid the letter'd poor, and soothe such ills as mine."
988,THE CURATE.,"We who more keenly feel the world's contempt,"
989,THE CURATE.,And from its miseries are the least exempt;
990,THE CURATE.,Now Hope shall whisper to the wounded breast
991,THE CURATE.,"And Grief, in soothing expectation, rest."
992,THE CURATE.,"""Yes, I am taught that men who think, who feel,"
993,THE CURATE.,Unite the pains of thoughtful men to heal;
994,THE CURATE.,"Not with disdainful pride, whose bounties make"
995,THE CURATE.,The needy curse the benefits they take;
996,THE CURATE.,Not with the idle vanity that knows
997,THE CURATE.,Only a selfish joy when it bestows;
998,THE CURATE.,"Not with o'erbearing wealth, that, in disdain,"
999,THE CURATE.,Hurls the superfluous bliss at groaning pain;
1000,THE CURATE.,"But these are men who yield such blest relief,"
1001,THE CURATE.,That with the grievance they destroy the grief;
1002,THE CURATE.,"Their timely aid the needy sufferers find,"
1003,THE CURATE.,Their generous manner soothes the suffering mind;
1004,THE CURATE.,"There is a gracious bounty, form'd to raise"
1005,THE CURATE.,Him whom it aids; their charity is praise;
1006,THE CURATE.,"A common bounty may relieve distress,"
1007,THE CURATE.,But whom the vulgar succour they oppress;
1008,THE CURATE.,"This though a favour is an honour too,"
1009,THE CURATE.,"Though Mercy's duty, yet 'tis Merit's due;"
1010,THE CURATE.,"When our relief from such resources rise,"
1011,THE CURATE.,All painful sense of obligation dies;
1012,THE CURATE.,"And grateful feelings in the bosom wake,"
1013,THE CURATE.,"For 'tis their offerings, not their alms we take."
1014,THE CURATE.,"""Long may these founts of Charity remain,"
1015,THE CURATE.,"And never shrink, but to be fill'd again;"

1017,THE CURATE.,"To him who gave the treasure of his mind,"
1018,THE CURATE.,"His time, his health,--and thankless found mankind:"

1025,THE CURATE.,"Who then can say, but bounty now so free,"
1026,THE CURATE.,"And so diffused, may find its way to me?"
1027,THE CURATE.,"""Yes! I may see my decent table yet"
1028,THE CURATE.,Cheer'd with the meal that adds not to my debt;
1029,THE CURATE.,"May talk of those to whom so much we owe,"
1030,THE CURATE.,And guess their names whom yet we may not know;
1031,THE CURATE.,"Blest, we shall say, are those who thus can give,"
1032,THE CURATE.,And next who thus upon the bounty live;

2171,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,His present evil--drink to our success -
2172,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,I flatter not; but did you ever see
2173,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Limbs better turn'd? a prettier boy than he?
2174,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"His senses all acute, his passions such"
2175,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,As Nature gave--she never does too much;
2176,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"His the bold wish the cup of joy to drain,"
2177,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,And strength to bear it without qualm or pain.
2178,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"""Now view his father as he dozing lies,"
2179,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Whose senses wake not when he opes his eyes;
2180,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Who slips and shuffles when he means to walk,"
2181,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,And lisps and gabbles if he tries to talk;
2182,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Feeling he's none--he could as soon destroy
2183,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"The earth itself, as aught it holds enjoy;"
2184,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"A nurse attends him to lay straight his limbs,"
2185,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Present his gruel, and respect his whims:"
2186,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Now shall this dotard from our hero hold
2187,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,His lands and lordships? Shall he hide his gold!
2188,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"That which he cannot use, and dare not show,"
2189,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,And will not give--why longer should he owe?
2190,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Yet, t'would be murder should we snap the locks,"
2191,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,And take the thing he worships from the box;
2192,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"So let him dote and dream:  but, till he die,"
2193,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Shall not our generous heir receive supply?
2194,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,For ever sitting on the river's brink?
2195,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"And ever thirsty, shall he fear to drink?"
2196,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"The means are simple, let him only wish,"
2197,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Then say he's willing, and I'll fill his dish."""
2198,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"They all applauded, and not least the boy,"
2199,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Who now replied, ""It fill'd his heart with joy"
2200,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,To find he needed not deliv'rance crave
2201,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Of death, or wish the Justice in the grave;"
2202,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Who, while he spent, would every art retain,"
2203,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Of luring home the scatter'd gold again;
2204,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Just as a fountain gaily spirts and plays
2205,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"With what returns in still and secret ways."""
2206,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Short was the dream of bliss; he quickly found
2207,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,His father's acres all were Swallow's ground.
2208,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Yet to those arts would other heroes lend
2209,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"A willing ear, and Swallow was their friend;"
2210,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Ever successful, some began to think"
2211,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,That Satan help'd him to his pen and ink;
2212,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"And shrewd suspicions ran about the place,"
2213,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"""There was a compact""--I must leave the case."
2214,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"But of the parties, had the fiend been one,"
2215,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,The business could not have been speedier done:
2216,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Still when a man has angled day and night,"
2217,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,The silliest gudgeons will refuse to bite:
2218,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,So Swallow tried no more:  but if they came
2219,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"To seek his friendship, that remain'd the same:"
2220,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Thus he retired in peace, and some would say"
2221,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"He'd balk'd his partner, and had learn'd to pray."
2222,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"To this some zealots lent an ear, and sought"
2223,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"How Swallow felt, then said ""a change is wrought."""
2224,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"'Twas true there wanted all the signs of grace,"
2225,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,But there were strong professions in their place;
2226,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Then, too, the less that men from him expect,"
2227,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,The more the praise to the converting sect;
2228,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"He had not yet subscribed to all their creed,"
2229,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Nor own'd a Call, but he confess'd the need:"
2230,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"His aquiescent speech, his gracious look,"
2231,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"That pure attention, when the brethren spoke,"
2232,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Was all contrition,--he had felt the wound,"
2233,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,And with confession would again be sound.
2234,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"True, Swallow's board had still the sumptuous treat;"
2235,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,But could they blame? the warmest zealots eat:
2236,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,He drank--'twas needful his poor nerves to brace;
2237,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,He swore--'twas habit; he was grieved--'twas grace:
2238,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,What could they do a new-born zeal to nurse?
2239,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"""His wealth's undoubted--let him hold our purse;"
2240,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"He'll add his bounty, and the house we'll raise"
2241,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Hard by the church, and gather all her strays:"
2242,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"We'll watch her sinners as they home retire,"
2243,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"And pluck the brands from the devouring fire."""
2244,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Alas! such speech was but an empty boast;
2245,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"The good men reckon'd, but without their host;"
2246,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Swallow, delighted, took the trusted store,"
2247,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"And own'd the sum; they did not ask for more,"
2248,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,Till more was needed; when they call'd for aid -
2249,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"And had it?--No, their agent was afraid:"
2250,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"""Could he but know to whom he should refund"
2251,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"He would most gladly--nay, he'd go beyond;"
2252,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"But when such numbers claim'd, when some were gone."
2253,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,And others going--he must hold it on;
2254,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"The Lord would help them.""--Loud their anger grew,"
2255,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"And while they threat'ning from his door withdrew,"
2256,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"He bow'd politely low, and bade them all adieu,"
2257,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,But lives the man by whom such deeds are done!
2258,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Yes, many such--But Swallow's race is run;"
2259,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"His name is lost,--for though his sons have name,"
2260,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"It is not his, they all escape the shame;"
2261,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Nor is there vestige now of all he had,"
2262,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"His means are wasted, for his heir was mad:"
2263,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"Still we of Swallow as a monster speak,"
2264,PROFESSIONS--LAW.,"A hard bad man, who prey'd upon the weak."

2417,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Then bursts the bubble, and the hungry cheat"
2418,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Pines for the bread he ill deserves to eat;

2425,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"This love of life, which in our nature rules,"
2426,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,To vile imposture makes us dupes and tools;
2427,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Then pain compels th' impatient soul to seize
2428,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,On promised hopes of instantaneous ease;

2461,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"No class escapes them--from the poor man's pay,"

2463,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"See! those square patent bottles from the shop,"
2464,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Now decoration to the cupboard's top;
2465,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"And there a favourite hoard you'll find within,"
2466,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Companions meet! the julep and the gin.
2467,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Time too with cash is wasted; 'tis the fate

2471,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Suppose the case surpasses human skill,"
2472,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,There comes a quack to flatter weakness still;
2473,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"What greater evil can a flatterer do,"
2474,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Than from himself to take the sufferer's view?
2475,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"To turn from sacred thoughts his reasoning powers,"
2476,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And rob a sinner of his dying hours?
2477,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Yet this they dare, and craving to the last,"
2478,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,In hope's strong bondage hold their victim fast:
2479,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"For soul or body no concern have they,"
2480,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"All their inquiry, ""Can the patient pay?"
2481,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"""And will he swallow draughts until his dying day?"""
2482,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Observe what ills to nervous females flow,"

2484,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"If once induced these cordial sips to try,"
2485,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"All feel the ease, and few the danger fly;"
2486,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"For, while obtain'd, of drams they've all the force,"
2487,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"And when denied, then drams are the resource."
2488,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Nor these the only evils--there are those
2489,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Who for the troubled mind prepare repose;
2490,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"They write:  the young are tenderly address'd,"
2491,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Much danger hinted, much concern express'd;"
2492,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"They dwell on freedoms lads are prone to take,"
2493,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Which makes the doctor tremble for their sake;
2494,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Still if the youthful patient will but trust
2495,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"In one so kind, so pitiful, and just;"
2496,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"If he will take the tonic all the time,"
2497,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And hold but moderate intercourse with crime;

2506,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"When air and light first rush'd on lungs and eyes,"
2507,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And there was life and spirit in the cries;
2508,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Now an abortive, faint attempt to weep"
2509,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Is all we hear; sensation is asleep:

2512,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"When cramm'd with food, and tighten'd every limb,"
2513,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,To cry aloud was what pertain'd to him;
2514,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Then the good nurse (who, had she borne a brain,"
2515,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Had sought the cause that made her babe complain)
2516,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Has all her efforts, loving soul! applied"
2517,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"To set the cry, and not the cause, aside;"
2518,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,She gave her powerful sweet without remorse
2519,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"The sleeping cordial--she had tried its force,"
2520,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Repeating oft:  the infant, freed from pain,"
2521,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Rejected food, but took the dose again,"
2522,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Sinking to sleep; while she her joy express'd,"
2523,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,That her dear charge could sweetly take his rest:
2524,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Soon may she spare her cordial; not a doubt
2525,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Remains, but quickly he will resfc without."
2526,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"This moves our grief and pity, and we sigh"
2527,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,To think what numbers from these causes die;
2528,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"But what contempt and anger should we show,"
2529,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Did we the lives of these impostors know!
2530,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Ere for the world's I left the cares of school,"
2531,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,One I remember who assumed the fool;
2532,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,A part well suited--when the idler boys
2533,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Would shout around him, and he loved the noise;"
2534,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,They called him Neddy;--Neddy had the art
2535,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,To play with skill his ignominious part;
2536,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"When he his trifles would for sale display,"
2537,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And act the mimic for a schoolboy's pay.
2538,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"For many years he plied his humble trade,"
2539,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And used his tricks and talents to persuade;
2540,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"The fellow barely read, but chanced to look"
2541,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Among the fragments of a tatter'd book;
2542,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Where, after many efforts made to spell"
2543,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"One puzzling word, he found it--oxymel;"
2544,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"A potent thing, 'twas said to cure the ills"
2545,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Of ailing lungs--the oxymel of squills:
2546,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Squills he procured, but found the bitter strong"
2547,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And most unpleasant; none would take it long;
2548,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,But the pure acid and the sweet would make
2549,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,A med'cine numbers would for pleasure take.
2550,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"There was a fellow near, an artful knave,"
2551,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Who knew the plan, and much assistance gave;"
2552,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"He wrote the puffs, and every talent plied"
2553,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"To make it sell:  it sold, and then he died."
2554,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Now all the profit fell to Ned's control,"
2555,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And Pride and Avarice quarrell'd for his soul;
2556,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"When mighty profits by the trash were made,"
2557,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Pride built a palace, Avarice groan'd and paid;"
2558,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Pride placed the signs of grandeur all about,"
2559,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And Avarice barr'd his friends and children out.
2560,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Now see him Doctor! yes, the idle fool,"
2561,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"The butt, the robber of the lads at school;"
2562,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Who then knew nothing, nothing since acquired,"
2563,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Became a doctor, honour'd and admired;"
2564,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"His dress, his frown, his dignity were such,"
2565,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Some who had known him thought his knowledge much;
2566,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Nay, men of skill, of apprehension quick,"
2567,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Spite of their knowledge, trusted him when sick;"
2568,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Though he could neither reason, write, nor spell,"
2569,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,They yet had hope his trash would make them well;
2570,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"And while they scorn'd his parts, they took his oxymel."
2571,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Oh! when his nerves had once received a shock,"
2572,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Sir Isaac Newton might have gone to Rock:
2573,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Hence impositions of the grossest kind,"
2574,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Hence thought is feeble, understanding blind;"
2575,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Hence sums enormous by those cheats are made,"
2576,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And deaths unnumber'd by their dreadful trade.
2577,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Alas! in vain is my contempt express'd,"
2578,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,To stronger passions are their words address'd;
2579,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"To pain, to fear, to terror, their appeal,"
2580,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"To those who, weakly reasoning, strongly feel."
2581,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,What then our hopes?--perhaps there may by law
2582,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Be method found these pests to curb and awe;
2583,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Yet in this land of freedom law is slack
2584,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,With any being to commence attack;
2585,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Then let us trust to science--there are those
2586,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Who can their falsehoods and their frauds disclose,"
2587,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"All their vile trash detect, and their low tricks expose;"
2588,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Perhaps their numbers may in time confound
2589,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,Their arts--as scorpions give themselves the wound;
2590,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"For when these curers dwell in every place,"
2591,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"While of the cured we not a man can trace,"
2592,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,"Strong truth may then the public mind persuade,"
2593,PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC.,And spoil the fruits of this nefarious trade.

2631,TRADES.,"'Tis small:  we boast not these rich subjects here,"
2632,TRADES.,Who hazard thrice ten thousand pounds a-year;
2633,TRADES.,"We've no huge buildings, where incessant noise"
2634,TRADES.,"Is made by springs and spindles, girls and boys;"
2635,TRADES.,"Where, 'mid such thundering sounds, the maiden's song"
2636,TRADES.,"Is ""Harmony in Uproar"" all day long."
2637,TRADES.,"Still common minds with us in common trade,"
2638,TRADES.,Have gain'd more wealth than ever student made;
2639,TRADES.,"And yet a merchant, when he gives his son"
2640,TRADES.,"His college-learning, thinks his duty done;"
2641,TRADES.,"A way to wealth he leaves his boy to find,"
2642,TRADES.,Just when he's made for the discovery blind.
2643,TRADES.,Jones and his wife perceived their elder boy
2644,TRADES.,"Took to his learning, and it gave them joy;"
2645,TRADES.,"This they encouraged, and were bless'd to see"
2646,TRADES.,Their son a fellow with a high degree;
2647,TRADES.,"A living fell, he married, and his sire"
2648,TRADES.,Declared 'twas all a father could require;
2649,TRADES.,"Children then bless'd them, and when letters came,"
2650,TRADES.,The parents proudly told each grandchild's name.
2651,TRADES.,"Meantime the sons at home in trade were placed,"
2652,TRADES.,Money their object--just the father's taste;
2653,TRADES.,"Saving he lived and long, and when he died,"

2655,TRADES.,"""Martin,"" said he, ""at vast expense was taught;"
2656,TRADES.,"He gain'd his wish, and has the ease he sought."""
2657,TRADES.,Thus the good priest (the Christian scholar!) finds

2659,TRADES.,"He sees his brothers, who had every gift"
2660,TRADES.,"Of thriving, now assisted in their thrift;"
2661,TRADES.,"While he, whom learning, habits, all prevent,"
2662,TRADES.,Is largely mulct for each impediment.
2663,TRADES.,"Yet let us own that Trade has much of chance,"
2664,TRADES.,Not all the careful by their care advance;
2665,TRADES.,"With the same parts and prospects, one a seat"

2670,TRADES.,No more have gain'd than--not to be in debt:
2671,TRADES.,"Who still maintain the same laborious course,"
2672,TRADES.,"Yet pleasure hails them from some favourite source,"
2673,TRADES.,"And health, amusements, children, wife, or friend,"
2674,TRADES.,With life's dull views their consolations blend.
2675,TRADES.,Nor these alone possess the lenient power
2676,TRADES.,Of soothing life in the desponding hour;
2677,TRADES.,"Some favourite studies, some delightful care,"
2678,TRADES.,The mind with trouble and distresses share;
2679,TRADES.,"And by a coin, a flower, a verse, a boat,"
2680,TRADES.,The stagnant spirits have been set afloat;
2681,TRADES.,"They pleased at first, and then the habit grew,"
2682,TRADES.,Till the fond heart no higher pleasure knew;
2683,TRADES.,"Till, from all cares and other comforts freed,"
2684,TRADES.,Th' important nothing took in life the lead.
2685,TRADES.,"With all his phlegm, it broke a Dutchman's heart,"
2686,TRADES.,"At a vast price, with one loved root to part;"

2700,TRADES.,And feels in hope the raptures of the day -
2701,TRADES.,"Eager he looks:  and soon, to glad his eyes,"
2702,TRADES.,"From the sweet bower, by nature form'd, arise"
2703,TRADES.,Bright troops of virgin moths and fresh-born butterflies;
2704,TRADES.,"Who broke that morning from their half-year's sleep,"
2705,TRADES.,To fly o'er flowers where they were wont to creep.
2706,TRADES.,"Above the sovereign oak, a sovereign skims,"
2707,TRADES.,"The purple Emp'ror, strong in wing and limbs:"
2708,TRADES.,"There fair Camilla takes her flight serene,"
2709,TRADES.,"Adonis blue, and Paphia silver-queen;"

2713,TRADES.,"Views ev'ry bell, and hums th' approving sound;"
2714,TRADES.,"Poised on her busy plumes, with feeling nice"

2724,TRADES.,"""This, this! is beauty; cast, I pray, your eyes"

2726,TRADES.,"Was ever stem so tall, so stout, so strong,"
2727,TRADES.,"Exact in breadth, in just proportion long?"
2728,TRADES.,"These brilliant hues are all distinct and clean,"
2729,TRADES.,"No kindred tint, no blending streaks between:"
2730,TRADES.,"This is no shaded, run-off, pin-eyed thing;"
2731,TRADES.,"A king of flowers, a flower for England's king:"
2732,TRADES.,"I own my pride, and thank the favouring star"

2734,TRADES.,"Thus may the poor the cheap indulgence seize,"
2735,TRADES.,While the most wealthy pine and pray for ease;
2736,TRADES.,"Content not always waits upon success,"
2737,TRADES.,And more may he enjoy who profits less.
2738,TRADES.,Walter and William took (their father dead)
2739,TRADES.,Jointly the trade to which they both were bred;
2740,TRADES.,"When fix'd, they married, and they quickly found"
2741,TRADES.,With due success their honest labours crown'd;
2742,TRADES.,"Few were their losses, but although a few,"
2743,TRADES.,Walter was vex'd and somewhat peevish grew:
2744,TRADES.,"""You put your trust in every pleading fool,"""
2745,TRADES.,"Said he to William, and grew strange and cool."
2746,TRADES.,"""Brother forbear,"" he answer'd; ""take your due,"
2747,TRADES.,"Nor let my lack of caution injure you:"""
2748,TRADES.,"Half friends they parted,--better so to close,"
2749,TRADES.,Than longer wait to part entirely foes.
2750,TRADES.,"Walter had knowledge, prudence, jealous care;"
2751,TRADES.,He let no idle views his bosom share;
2752,TRADES.,He never thought nor felt for other men -
2753,TRADES.,"""Let one mind one, and all are minded then."""
2754,TRADES.,"Friends he respected, and believed them just,"
2755,TRADES.,"But they were men, and he would no man trust;"
2756,TRADES.,"He tried and watch'd his people day and night, -"
2757,TRADES.,The good it harm'd not; for the bad 'twas right:
2758,TRADES.,"He could their humours bear, nay disrespect,"
2759,TRADES.,But he could yield no pardon to neglect;
2760,TRADES.,That all about him were of him afraid
2761,TRADES.,"""Was right,"" he said--""so should we be obey'd."""
2762,TRADES.,"These merchant-maxims, much good fortune too,"
2763,TRADES.,"And ever keeping one grand point in view,"
2764,TRADES.,To vast amount his once small portion drew.
2765,TRADES.,William was kind and easy; he complied
2766,TRADES.,"With all requests, or grieved when he denied;"
2767,TRADES.,"To please his wife he made a costly trip,"
2768,TRADES.,To please his child he let a bargain slip;
2769,TRADES.,"Prone to compassion, mild with the distress'd,"
2770,TRADES.,"He bore with all who poverty profess'd,"
2771,TRADES.,"And some would he assist, nor one would he arrest."
2772,TRADES.,"He had some loss at sea, bad debts at land,"
2773,TRADES.,"His clerk absconded with some bills in hand,"
2774,TRADES.,"And plans so often fail'd, that he no longer plann'd."
2775,TRADES.,"To a small house (his brother's) he withdrew,"
2776,TRADES.,At easy rent--the man was not a Jew;
2777,TRADES.,"And there his losses and his cares he bore,"
2778,TRADES.,Nor found that want of wealth could make him poor.
2779,TRADES.,"No, he in fact was rich! nor could he move,"
2780,TRADES.,But he was follow'd by the looks of love;
2781,TRADES.,"All he had suffer'd, every former grief,"
2782,TRADES.,Made those around more studious in relief;
2783,TRADES.,"He saw a cheerful smile in every face,"
2784,TRADES.,And lost all thoughts of error and disgrace.
2785,TRADES.,Pleasant it was to see them in their walk
2786,TRADES.,"Round their small garden, and to hear them talk;"
2787,TRADES.,"Free are their children, but their love refrains"
2788,TRADES.,"From all offence--none murmurs, none complains;"
2789,TRADES.,"Whether a book amused them, speech or play,"
2790,TRADES.,"Their looks were lively, and their hearts were gay;"
2791,TRADES.,"There no forced efforts for delight were made,"
2792,TRADES.,"Joy came with prudence, and without parade;"
2793,TRADES.,"Their common comforts they had all in view,"
2794,TRADES.,"Light were their troubles, and their wishes few:"
2795,TRADES.,"Thrift made them easy for the coming day,"
2796,TRADES.,Religion took the dread of death away;
2797,TRADES.,"A cheerful spirit still ensured content,"
2798,TRADES.,And love smiled round them wheresoe'er they went.
2799,TRADES.,"Walter, meantime, with all his wealth's increase,"
2800,TRADES.,"Gain'd many points, but could not purchase peace;"
2801,TRADES.,"When he withdrew from business for an hour,"
2802,TRADES.,"Some fled his presence, all confess'd his power;"
2803,TRADES.,"He sought affection, but received instead"
2804,TRADES.,"Fear undisguised, and love-repelling dread;"
2805,TRADES.,"He look'd around him--""Harriet, dost thou love?"""
2806,TRADES.,"""I do my duty,"" said the timid dove;"
2807,TRADES.,"""Good Heav'n, your duty! prithee, tell me now -"
2808,TRADES.,To love and honour--was not that your vow?
2809,TRADES.,"Come, my good Harriet, I would gladly seek"
2810,TRADES.,Your inmost thought--Why can't the woman speak?
2811,TRADES.,"Have you not all things?""--""Sir, do I complain?"" -"
2812,TRADES.,"""No, that's my part, which I perform in vain;"
2813,TRADES.,"I want a simple answer, and direct -"
2814,TRADES.,But you evade; yes! 'tis as I suspect.
2815,TRADES.,"Come then, my children! Watt! upon your knees"
2816,TRADES.,"Vow that you love me.""--""Yes, sir, if you please."""
2817,TRADES.,"""Again!  By Heav'n, it mads me; I require"
2818,TRADES.,"Love, and they'll do whatever I desire:"
2819,TRADES.,Thus too my people shun me; I would spend
2820,TRADES.,A thousand pounds to get a single friend;
2821,TRADES.,I would be happy--I have means to pay
2822,TRADES.,"For love and friendship, and you run away:"
2823,TRADES.,"Ungrateful creatures! why, you seem to dread"
2824,TRADES.,My very looks; I know you wish me dead.
2825,TRADES.,"Come hither, Nancy! you must hold me dear;"
2826,TRADES.,"Hither, I say; why! what have you to fear?"
2827,TRADES.,"You see I'm gentle--Come, you trifler, come:"
2828,TRADES.,"My God! she trembles!--Idiot, leave the room!"
2829,TRADES.,Madam; your children hate me; I suppose
2830,TRADES.,They know their cue; you make them all my foes:
2831,TRADES.,I've not a friend in all the world--not one:
2832,TRADES.,"I'd be a bankrupt sooner; nay, 'tis done;"
2833,TRADES.,"In every better hope of life I fail,"
2834,TRADES.,"You're all tormentors, and my house a jail."
2835,TRADES.,Out of my sight! I'll sit and make my will -
2836,TRADES.,"What, glad to go? stay, devils, and be still;"
2837,TRADES.,"'Tis to your Uncle's cot you wish to run,"
2838,TRADES.,To learn to live at ease and be undone;
2839,TRADES.,"Him you can love, who lost his whole estate,"
2840,TRADES.,"And I, who gain you fortunes, have your hate;"
2841,TRADES.,'Tis in my absence you yourselves enjoy:
2842,TRADES.,"Tom! are you glad to lose me? tell me, boy:"
2843,TRADES.,Yes! does he answer?--Yes! upon my soul;
2844,TRADES.,"No awe, no fear, no duty, no control!"
2845,TRADES.,Away! away! ten thousand devils seize
2846,TRADES.,"All I possess, and plunder where they please!"
2847,TRADES.,"What's wealth to me?--yes, yes! it gives me sway,"
2848,TRADES.,"And you shall feel it--Go! begone, I say."" {4}"

2883,AMUSEMENTS.,"Or, seeking nothing, glide about the street,"
2884,AMUSEMENTS.,"And so engaged, with various parties meet;"
2885,AMUSEMENTS.,"Awhile we stop, discourse of wind and tide"
2886,AMUSEMENTS.,"Bathing and books, the raffle, and the ride;"
2887,AMUSEMENTS.,"Thus, with the aid which shops and sailing give,"
2888,AMUSEMENTS.,"Life passes on; 'tis labour, but we live."
2889,AMUSEMENTS.,"When evening comes, our invalids awake,"
2890,AMUSEMENTS.,"Nerves cease to tremble, heads forbear to ache;"
2891,AMUSEMENTS.,"Then cheerful meals the sunken spirits raise,"
2892,AMUSEMENTS.,"Cards or the dance, wine, visiting, or plays."
2893,AMUSEMENTS.,"Soon as the season comes, and crowds arrive,"
2894,AMUSEMENTS.,To their superior rooms the wealthy drive;
2895,AMUSEMENTS.,"Others look round for lodging snug and small,"
2896,AMUSEMENTS.,Such is their taste--they've hatred to a hall:
2897,AMUSEMENTS.,"Hence one his fav'rite habitation gets,"
2898,AMUSEMENTS.,The brick-floor'd parlour which the butcher lets;
2899,AMUSEMENTS.,"Where, through his single light, he may regard"
2900,AMUSEMENTS.,"The various business of a common yard,"
2901,AMUSEMENTS.,"Bounded by backs of buildings form'd of clay,"
2902,AMUSEMENTS.,"By stable, sties, and coops, et caetera."
2903,AMUSEMENTS.,"The needy-vain, themselves awhile to shun,"
2904,AMUSEMENTS.,For dissipation to these dog-holes run;
2905,AMUSEMENTS.,"Where each (assuming petty pomp) appears,"
2906,AMUSEMENTS.,And quite forgets the shopboard and the shears.
2907,AMUSEMENTS.,For them are cheap amusements:  they may slip
2908,AMUSEMENTS.,Beyond the town and take a private dip;
2909,AMUSEMENTS.,"When they may urge that, to be safe they mean,"
2910,AMUSEMENTS.,They've heard there's danger in a light machine;
2911,AMUSEMENTS.,"They too can gratis move the quays about,"
2912,AMUSEMENTS.,And gather kind replies to every doubt;
2913,AMUSEMENTS.,"There they a pacing, lounging tribe may view,"
2914,AMUSEMENTS.,"The stranger's guides, who've little else to do;"
2915,AMUSEMENTS.,"The Borough's placemen, where no more they gain"
2916,AMUSEMENTS.,"Than keeps them idle, civil, poor, and vain."
2917,AMUSEMENTS.,Then may the poorest with the wealthy look
2918,AMUSEMENTS.,"On ocean, glorious page of Nature's book!"
2919,AMUSEMENTS.,"May see its varying views in every hour,"
2920,AMUSEMENTS.,"All softness now, then rising with all power,"
2921,AMUSEMENTS.,"As sleeping to invite, or threat'ning to devour:"
2922,AMUSEMENTS.,'Tis this which gives us all our choicest views;
2923,AMUSEMENTS.,"Its waters heal us, and its shores amuse."
2924,AMUSEMENTS.,"See! those fair nymphs upon that rising strand,"
2925,AMUSEMENTS.,Yon long salt lake has parted from the land;
2926,AMUSEMENTS.,"Well pleased to press that path, so clean, so pure,"
2927,AMUSEMENTS.,"To seem in danger, yet to feel secure;"
2928,AMUSEMENTS.,"Trifling with terror, while they strive to shun"
2929,AMUSEMENTS.,The curling billows; laughing as they run;
2930,AMUSEMENTS.,"They know the neck that joins the shore and sea,"
2931,AMUSEMENTS.,"Or, ah! how changed that fearless laugh would be."
2932,AMUSEMENTS.,"Observe how various Parties take their way,"
2933,AMUSEMENTS.,"By seaside walks, or make the sand-hills gay;"
2934,AMUSEMENTS.,"There group'd are laughing maids and sighing swains,"
2935,AMUSEMENTS.,And some apart who feel unpitied pains;
2936,AMUSEMENTS.,"Pains from diseases, pains which those who feel,"
2937,AMUSEMENTS.,"To the physician, not the fair, reveal:"
2938,AMUSEMENTS.,For nymphs (propitious to the lover's sigh)
2939,AMUSEMENTS.,Leave these poor patients to complain and die.
2940,AMUSEMENTS.,Lo! where on that huge anchor sadly leans
2941,AMUSEMENTS.,"That sick tall figure, lost in other scenes;"
2942,AMUSEMENTS.,"He late from India's clime impatient sail'd,"
2943,AMUSEMENTS.,"There, as his fortune grew, his spirits fail'd;"
2944,AMUSEMENTS.,"For each delight, in search of wealth he went,"
2945,AMUSEMENTS.,"For ease alone, the wealth acquired is spent -"
2946,AMUSEMENTS.,"And spent in vain; enrich'd, aggrieved, he sees"
2947,AMUSEMENTS.,The envied poor possess'd of joy and ease:
2948,AMUSEMENTS.,"And now he flies from place to place, to gain"
2949,AMUSEMENTS.,"Strength for enjoyment, and still flies in vain:"
2950,AMUSEMENTS.,"Mark! with what sadness, of that pleasant crew,"
2951,AMUSEMENTS.,"Boist'rous in mirth, he takes a transient view;"
2952,AMUSEMENTS.,"And fixing then his eye upon the sea,"
2953,AMUSEMENTS.,Thinks what has been and what must shortly be:
2954,AMUSEMENTS.,"Is it not strange that man should health destroy,"
2955,AMUSEMENTS.,For joys that come when he is dead to joy?
2956,AMUSEMENTS.,"Now is it pleasant in the Summer-eve,"
2957,AMUSEMENTS.,"When a broad shore retiring waters leave,"
2958,AMUSEMENTS.,"Awhile to wait upon the firm fair sand,"
2959,AMUSEMENTS.,"When all is calm at sea, all still at land;"
2960,AMUSEMENTS.,"And there the ocean's produce to explore,"
2961,AMUSEMENTS.,"As floating by, or rolling on the shore:"
2962,AMUSEMENTS.,"Those living jellies which the flesh inflame,"
2963,AMUSEMENTS.,"Fierce as a nettle, and from that its name;"
2964,AMUSEMENTS.,"Some in huge masses, some that you may bring"
2965,AMUSEMENTS.,In the small compass of a lady's ring;
2966,AMUSEMENTS.,Figured by hand divine--there's not a gem
2967,AMUSEMENTS.,Wrought by man's art to be compared to them;
2968,AMUSEMENTS.,"Soft, brilliant, tender, through the wave they glow,"
2969,AMUSEMENTS.,And make the moonbeam brighter where they flow.
2970,AMUSEMENTS.,"Involved in sea-wrack, here you find a race"
2971,AMUSEMENTS.,"Which science, doubting, knows not where to place;"
2972,AMUSEMENTS.,"On shell or stone is dropp'd the embryo-seed,"
2973,AMUSEMENTS.,And quickly vegetates a vital breed.
2974,AMUSEMENTS.,While thus with pleasing wonder you inspect
2975,AMUSEMENTS.,"Treasures the vulgar in their scorn reject,"
2976,AMUSEMENTS.,See as they float along th' entangled weeds
2977,AMUSEMENTS.,"Slowly approach, upborne on bladdery beads;"
2978,AMUSEMENTS.,"Wait till they land, and you shall then behold"
2979,AMUSEMENTS.,"The fiery sparks those tangled fronds infold,"
2980,AMUSEMENTS.,Myriads of living points; th' unaided eye
2981,AMUSEMENTS.,Can but the fire and not the form descry.
2982,AMUSEMENTS.,"And now your view upon the ocean turn,"
2983,AMUSEMENTS.,And there the splendour of the waves discern;
2984,AMUSEMENTS.,"Cast but a stone, or strike them with an oar,"
2985,AMUSEMENTS.,And you shall flames within the deep explore;
2986,AMUSEMENTS.,"Or scoop the stream phosphoric as you stand,"
2987,AMUSEMENTS.,And the cold flames shall flash along your hand;
2988,AMUSEMENTS.,"When, lost in wonder, you shall walk and gaze"
2989,AMUSEMENTS.,"On weeds that sparkle, and on waves that blaze."
2990,AMUSEMENTS.,"The ocean too has Winter views serene,"
2991,AMUSEMENTS.,When all you see through densest fog is seen;
2992,AMUSEMENTS.,When you can hear the fishers near at hand
2993,AMUSEMENTS.,"Distinctly speak, yet see not where they stand;"
2994,AMUSEMENTS.,Or sometimes them and not their boat discern;
2995,AMUSEMENTS.,Or half-conceal'd some figure at the stern;
2996,AMUSEMENTS.,"The view's all bounded, and from side to side"
2997,AMUSEMENTS.,Your utmost prospect but a few ells wide;
2998,AMUSEMENTS.,"Boys who, on shore, to sea the pebble cast,"
2999,AMUSEMENTS.,Will hear it strike against the viewless mast;
3000,AMUSEMENTS.,"While the stern boatman growls his fierce disdain,"
3001,AMUSEMENTS.,"At whom he knows not, whom he threats in vain."
3002,AMUSEMENTS.,"Tis pleasant then to view the nets float past,"
3003,AMUSEMENTS.,Net after net till you have seen the last:
3004,AMUSEMENTS.,"And as you wait till all beyond you slip,"
3005,AMUSEMENTS.,"A boat comes gliding from an anchor'd ship,"
3006,AMUSEMENTS.,"Breaking the silence with the dipping oar,"
3007,AMUSEMENTS.,"And their own tones, as labouring for the shore;"
3008,AMUSEMENTS.,"Those measured tones which with the scene agree,"
3009,AMUSEMENTS.,And give a sadness to serenity.
3010,AMUSEMENTS.,"All scenes like these the tender Maid should shun,"
3011,AMUSEMENTS.,Nor to a misty beach in autumn run;
3012,AMUSEMENTS.,"Much should she guard against the evening cold,"
3013,AMUSEMENTS.,And her slight shape with fleecy warmth infold;
3014,AMUSEMENTS.,"This she admits, but not with so much ease"
3015,AMUSEMENTS.,Gives up the night-walk when th' attendants please:
3016,AMUSEMENTS.,"Her have I seen, pale, vapour'd through the day,"
3017,AMUSEMENTS.,With crowded parties at the midnight play;
3018,AMUSEMENTS.,"Faint in the morn, no powers could she exert;"
3019,AMUSEMENTS.,At night with Pam delighted and alert;
3020,AMUSEMENTS.,"In a small shop she's raffled with a crowd,"
3021,AMUSEMENTS.,"Breath'd the thick air, and cough'd and laugh'd aloud;"
3022,AMUSEMENTS.,She who will tremble if her eye explore
3023,AMUSEMENTS.,"""The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor;"""
3024,AMUSEMENTS.,"Whom the kind doctor charged, with shaking head,"
3025,AMUSEMENTS.,At early hour to quit the beaux for bed;
3026,AMUSEMENTS.,"She has, contemning fear, gone down the dance,"
3027,AMUSEMENTS.,Till she perceived the rosy morn advance;
3028,AMUSEMENTS.,"Then has she wonder'd, fainting o'er her tea,"
3029,AMUSEMENTS.,Her drops and julep should so useless be:
3030,AMUSEMENTS.,"Ah! sure her joys must ravish every sense,"
3031,AMUSEMENTS.,Who buys a portion at such vast expense.
3032,AMUSEMENTS.,"Among those joys, 'tis one at eve to sail"
3033,AMUSEMENTS.,On the broad River with a favourite gale;
3034,AMUSEMENTS.,"When no rough waves upon the bosom ride,"
3035,AMUSEMENTS.,"But the keel cuts, nor rises on the tide;"
3036,AMUSEMENTS.,"Safe from the stream the nearer gunwale stands,"
3037,AMUSEMENTS.,Where playful children trail their idle hands:
3038,AMUSEMENTS.,Or strive to catch long grassy leaves that float
3039,AMUSEMENTS.,On either side of the impeded boat;
3040,AMUSEMENTS.,"What time the moon arising shows the mud,"
3041,AMUSEMENTS.,A shining border to the silver flood:
3042,AMUSEMENTS.,"When, by her dubious light, the meanest views,"
3043,AMUSEMENTS.,"Chalk, stones, and stakes, obtain the richest hues;"
3044,AMUSEMENTS.,"And when the cattle, as they gazing stand,"
3045,AMUSEMENTS.,Seem nobler objects than when view'd from land:
3046,AMUSEMENTS.,"Then anchor'd vessels in the way appear,"
3047,AMUSEMENTS.,"And sea-boys greet them as they pass--""What cheer?"""
3048,AMUSEMENTS.,"The sleeping shell-ducks at the sound arise,"
3049,AMUSEMENTS.,And utter loud their unharmonious cries;
3050,AMUSEMENTS.,"Fluttering they move their weedy beds among,"
3051,AMUSEMENTS.,"Or instant diving, hide their plumeless young."
3052,AMUSEMENTS.,"Along the wall, returning from the town,"
3053,AMUSEMENTS.,The weary rustic homeward wanders down:
3054,AMUSEMENTS.,"Who stops and gazes at such joyous crew,"
3055,AMUSEMENTS.,And feels his envy rising at the view;
3056,AMUSEMENTS.,"He the light speech and laugh indignant hears,"
3057,AMUSEMENTS.,"And feels more press'd by want, more vex'd by fears."
3058,AMUSEMENTS.,"Ah! go in peace, good fellow, to thine home,"
3059,AMUSEMENTS.,Nor fancy these escape the general doom:
3060,AMUSEMENTS.,"Gay as they seem, be sure with them are hearts"
3061,AMUSEMENTS.,With sorrow tried; there's sadness in their parts:
3062,AMUSEMENTS.,"If thou couldst see them when they think alone,"
3063,AMUSEMENTS.,"Mirth, music, friends, and these amusements gone;"
3064,AMUSEMENTS.,Couldst thou discover every secret ill
3065,AMUSEMENTS.,"That pains their spirit, or resists their will;"
3066,AMUSEMENTS.,"Couldst thou behold forsaken Love's distress,"
3067,AMUSEMENTS.,"Or Envy's pang at glory and success,"
3068,AMUSEMENTS.,"Or Beauty, conscious of the spoils of Time,"
3069,AMUSEMENTS.,Or Guilt alarm'd when Memory shows the crime;
3070,AMUSEMENTS.,"All that gives sorrow, terror, grief, and gloom;"
3071,AMUSEMENTS.,Content would cheer thee trudging to thine home.
3072,AMUSEMENTS.,"There are, 'tis true, who lay their cares aside,"
3073,AMUSEMENTS.,And bid some hours in calm enjoyment glide;
3074,AMUSEMENTS.,Perchance some fair one to the sober night
3075,AMUSEMENTS.,Adds (by the sweetness of her song) delight;
3076,AMUSEMENTS.,"And as the music on the water floats,"
3077,AMUSEMENTS.,Some bolder shore returns the soften'd notes;
3078,AMUSEMENTS.,"Then, youth, beware, for all around conspire"
3079,AMUSEMENTS.,To banish caution and to wake desire;
3080,AMUSEMENTS.,"The day's amusement, feasting, beauty, wine,"
3081,AMUSEMENTS.,"These accents sweet and this soft hour combine,"
3082,AMUSEMENTS.,"When most unguarded, then to win that heart of thine:"
3083,AMUSEMENTS.,"But see, they land! the fond enchantment flies,"
3084,AMUSEMENTS.,And in its place life's common views arise.
3085,AMUSEMENTS.,"Sometimes a Party, row'd from town will land"
3086,AMUSEMENTS.,"On a small islet form'd of shelly sand,"
3087,AMUSEMENTS.,"Left by the water when the tides are low,"
3088,AMUSEMENTS.,But which the floods in their return o'erflow:
3089,AMUSEMENTS.,"There will they anchor, pleased awhile to view"
3090,AMUSEMENTS.,"The watery waste, a prospect wild and new;"
3091,AMUSEMENTS.,"The now receding billows give them space,"
3092,AMUSEMENTS.,On either side the growing shores to pace;
3093,AMUSEMENTS.,"And then returning, they contract the scene,"
3094,AMUSEMENTS.,Till small and smaller grows the walk between;
3095,AMUSEMENTS.,"As sea to sea approaches, shore to shores,"
3096,AMUSEMENTS.,Till the next ebb the sandy isle restores.
3097,AMUSEMENTS.,"Then what alarm! what danger and dismay,"
3098,AMUSEMENTS.,"If all their trust, their boat, should drift away;"
3099,AMUSEMENTS.,"And once it happen'd--Gay the friends advanced,"
3100,AMUSEMENTS.,"They walk'd, they ran, they play'd, they sang, they danced;"
3101,AMUSEMENTS.,"The urns were boiling, and the cups went round,"
3102,AMUSEMENTS.,And not a grave or thoughtful face was found;
3103,AMUSEMENTS.,"On the bright sand they trod with nimble feet,"
3104,AMUSEMENTS.,Dry shelly sand that made the summer-seat;
3105,AMUSEMENTS.,"The wondering mews flew fluttering o'er the head,"
3106,AMUSEMENTS.,And waves ran softly up their shining bed.
3107,AMUSEMENTS.,"Some form'd a party from the rest to stray,"
3108,AMUSEMENTS.,Pleased to collect the trifles in their way;
3109,AMUSEMENTS.,"These to behold they call their friends around,"
3110,AMUSEMENTS.,"No friends can hear, or hear another sound;"
3111,AMUSEMENTS.,"Alarm'd, they hasten, yet perceive not why,"
3112,AMUSEMENTS.,But catch the fear that quickens as they fly.
3113,AMUSEMENTS.,"For lo! a lady sage, who paced the sand"
3114,AMUSEMENTS.,"With her fair children, one in either hand,"
3115,AMUSEMENTS.,"Intent on home, had turn'd, and saw the boat"
3116,AMUSEMENTS.,"Slipp'd from her moorings, and now far afloat;"
3117,AMUSEMENTS.,"She gazed, she trembled, and though faint her call,"
3118,AMUSEMENTS.,"It seem'd, like thunder, to confound them all."
3119,AMUSEMENTS.,"Their sailor-guides, the boatman and his mate,"
3120,AMUSEMENTS.,"Had drank, and slept regardless of their state:"
3121,AMUSEMENTS.,"""Awake!"" they cried aloud; ""Alarm the shore!"
3122,AMUSEMENTS.,"Shout all, or never shall we reach it more!"""
3123,AMUSEMENTS.,"Alas! no shout the distant land can reach,"
3124,AMUSEMENTS.,Nor eye behold them from the foggy beach:
3125,AMUSEMENTS.,"Again they join in one loud powerful cry,"
3126,AMUSEMENTS.,"Then cease, and eager listen for reply;"
3127,AMUSEMENTS.,None came--the rising wind blew sadly by:
3128,AMUSEMENTS.,"They shout once more, and then they turn aside,"
3129,AMUSEMENTS.,To see how quickly flow'd the coming tide;
3130,AMUSEMENTS.,Between each cry they find the waters steal
3131,AMUSEMENTS.,"On their strange prison, and new horrors feel;"
3132,AMUSEMENTS.,Foot after foot on the contracted ground
3133,AMUSEMENTS.,"The billows fall, and dreadful is the sound;"
3134,AMUSEMENTS.,"Less and yet less the sinking isle became,"
3135,AMUSEMENTS.,"And there was wailing, weeping, wrath, and blame."
3136,AMUSEMENTS.,"Had one been there, with spirit strong and high,"
3137,AMUSEMENTS.,"Who could observe, as he prepared to die,"
3138,AMUSEMENTS.,"He might have seen of hearts the varying kind,"
3139,AMUSEMENTS.,And traced the movement of each different mind:
3140,AMUSEMENTS.,"He might have seen, that not the gentle maid"
3141,AMUSEMENTS.,Was more than stern and haughty man afraid;
3142,AMUSEMENTS.,"Such, calmly grieving, will their fears suppress,"
3143,AMUSEMENTS.,And silent prayers to Mercy's throne address;
3144,AMUSEMENTS.,"While fiercer minds, impatient, angry, loud,"
3145,AMUSEMENTS.,Force their vain grief on the reluctant crowd:
3146,AMUSEMENTS.,"The party's patron, sorely sighing, cried,"
3147,AMUSEMENTS.,"""Why would you urge me? I at first denied."""
3148,AMUSEMENTS.,"Fiercely they answer'd, ""Why will you complain,"
3149,AMUSEMENTS.,"Who saw no danger, or was warn'd in vain?"""
3150,AMUSEMENTS.,"A few essay'd the troubled soul to calm,"
3151,AMUSEMENTS.,"But dread prevail'd, and anguish and alarm."
3152,AMUSEMENTS.,"Now rose the water through the lessening sand,"
3153,AMUSEMENTS.,And they seem'd sinking while they yet could stand.
3154,AMUSEMENTS.,"The sun went down, they look'd from side to side,"
3155,AMUSEMENTS.,Nor aught except the gathering sea descried;
3156,AMUSEMENTS.,"Dark and more dark, more wet, more cold it grew,"
3157,AMUSEMENTS.,And the most lively bade to hope adieu:
3158,AMUSEMENTS.,"Children by love then lifted from the seas,"
3159,AMUSEMENTS.,"Felt not the waters at the parent's knees,"
3160,AMUSEMENTS.,"But wept aloud; the wind increased the sound,"
3161,AMUSEMENTS.,And the cold billows as they broke around.
3162,AMUSEMENTS.,"""Once more, yet once again, with all our strength,"
3163,AMUSEMENTS.,"Cry to the land--we may be heard at length."""
3164,AMUSEMENTS.,"Vain hope if yet unseen! but hark! an oar,"
3165,AMUSEMENTS.,That sound of bliss! comes dashing to their shore;
3166,AMUSEMENTS.,"Still, still the water rises; ""Haste!"" they cry,"
3167,AMUSEMENTS.,"""Oh! hurry, seamen; in delay we die;"""
3168,AMUSEMENTS.,"(Seamen were these, who in their ship perceived"
3169,AMUSEMENTS.,"The drifted boat, and thus her crew relieved.)"
3170,AMUSEMENTS.,"And now the keel just cuts the cover'd sand,"
3171,AMUSEMENTS.,Now to the gunwale stretches every hand:
3172,AMUSEMENTS.,"With trembling pleasure all confused embark,"
3173,AMUSEMENTS.,And kiss the tackling of their welcome ark;
3174,AMUSEMENTS.,"While the most giddy, as they reach the shore,"
3175,AMUSEMENTS.,"Think of their danger, and their GOD adore."

3903,INNS.,James in an evil hour went forth to woo
3904,INNS.,"Young Juliet Hart, and was her Romeo:"
3905,INNS.,"They'd seen the play, and thought it vastly sweet"
3906,INNS.,For two young lovers by the moon to meet;

3915,INNS.,"Then first repentance seized the amorous man,"
3916,INNS.,And--shame on love!--he reason'd and he ran;
3917,INNS.,"The thoughtful Romeo trembled for his purse,"
3918,INNS.,"And the sad sounds, ""for better and for worse."""
3919,INNS.,"Yet could the Lover not so far withdraw,"
3920,INNS.,But he was haunted both by Love and Law;
3921,INNS.,"Now Law dismay'd him as he view'd its fangs,"
3922,INNS.,Now Pity seized him for his Juliet's pangs;
3923,INNS.,"Then thoughts of justice and some dread of jail,"
3924,INNS.,"Where all would blame him, and where none might bail;"
3925,INNS.,"These drew him back, till Juliet's hut appear'd,"
3926,INNS.,Where love had drawn him when he should have fear'd.
3927,INNS.,"There sat the father in his wicker throne,"
3928,INNS.,Uttering his curses in tremendous tone:
3929,INNS.,"With foulest names his daughter he reviled,"
3930,INNS.,And look'd a very Herod at the child:
3931,INNS.,"Nor was she patient, but with equal scorn,"
3932,INNS.,Bade him remember when his Joe was born:
3933,INNS.,"Then rose the mother, eager to begin"
3934,INNS.,"Her plea for frailty, when the swain came in."
3935,INNS.,"To him she turn'd, and other theme began,"

3941,INNS.,"""If she your love as wife and mother claim,"
3942,INNS.,What can it matter which was first the name?

3948,INNS.,My good friend Fletcher to be one of those;
3949,INNS.,What's done amiss he'll mend in proper time -
3950,INNS.,I hate to hear of villany and crime:
3951,INNS.,"'Twas my misfortune, in the days of youth,"
3952,INNS.,To find two lasses pleading for my truth;
3953,INNS.,"The case was hard, I would with all my soul"
3954,INNS.,"Have wedded both, but law is our control;"
3955,INNS.,"So one I took, and when we gain'd a home,"

3957,INNS.,"And when she found that I'd a widow'd bed,"
3958,INNS.,Me she desired--what could I less?--to wed.
3959,INNS.,An easier case is yours:  you've not the smart
3960,INNS.,That two fond pleaders cause in one man's heart.
3961,INNS.,"You've not to wait from year to year distress'd,"
3962,INNS.,Before your conscience can be laid at rest;

3965,INNS.,"""My loving James,""--the Lass began her plea,"

3969,INNS.,"Had I refused, when 'twas thy part to pray,"
3970,INNS.,Or put thee off with promise and delay;

3972,INNS.,Denying her who taught thee to deny:
3973,INNS.,"But, James, with me thou hadst an easier task,"
3974,INNS.,Bonds and conditions I forbore to ask;
3975,INNS.,"I laid no traps for thee, no plots or plans,"
3976,INNS.,Nor marriage named by licence or by banns;
3977,INNS.,"Nor would I now the parson's aid employ,"

3979,INNS.,Motives like these could heart of flesh resist?
3980,INNS.,James took the infant and in triumph kiss'd;

4054,PLAYERS.,"Full well they grin, they should not try to groan;"

4111,PLAYERS.,"Yet keen those griefs--ah! what avail thy charms,"
4112,PLAYERS.,Fair Juliet! what that infant in thine arms;
4113,PLAYERS.,"What those heroic lines thy patience learns,"
4114,PLAYERS.,"What all the aid thy present Romeo earns,"
4115,PLAYERS.,Whilst thou art crowded in that lumbering wain
4116,PLAYERS.,With all thy plaintive sisters to complain?
4117,PLAYERS.,"Nor is there lack of labour--To rehearse,"
4118,PLAYERS.,"Day after day, poor scraps of prose and verse;"
4119,PLAYERS.,"To bear each other's spirit, pride, and spite;"
4120,PLAYERS.,To hide in rant the heart ache of the night;
4121,PLAYERS.,"To dress in gaudy patchwork, and to force"
4122,PLAYERS.,The mind to think on the appointed course; -
4123,PLAYERS.,"This is laborious, and may be defined"
4124,PLAYERS.,The bootless labour of the thriftless mind.
4125,PLAYERS.,There is a veteran Dame:  I see her stand
4126,PLAYERS.,Intent and pensive with her book in hand;
4127,PLAYERS.,"Awhile her thoughts she forces on her part,"
4128,PLAYERS.,Then dwells on objects nearer to the heart;
4129,PLAYERS.,"Across the room she paces, gets her tone,"
4130,PLAYERS.,And fits her features for the Danish throne;
4131,PLAYERS.,"To-night a queen--I mark her motion slow,"
4132,PLAYERS.,"I hear her speech, and Hamlet's mother know."
4133,PLAYERS.,Methinks 'tis pitiful to see her try
4134,PLAYERS.,For strength of arms and energy of eye;
4135,PLAYERS.,"With vigour lost, and spirits worn away,"
4136,PLAYERS.,Her pomp and pride she labours to display;
4137,PLAYERS.,"And when awhile she's tried her part to act,"
4138,PLAYERS.,To find her thoughts arrested by some fact;
4139,PLAYERS.,"When struggles more and more severe are seen,"
4140,PLAYERS.,"In the plain actress than the Danish queen, -"
4141,PLAYERS.,"At length she feels her part, she finds delight,"
4142,PLAYERS.,And fancies all the plaudits of the night;
4143,PLAYERS.,"Old as she is, she smiles at every speech,"
4144,PLAYERS.,"And thinks no youthful part beyond her reach,"
4145,PLAYERS.,But as the mist of vanity again
4146,PLAYERS.,"Is blown away, by press of present pain,"
4147,PLAYERS.,Sad and in doubt she to her purse applies
4148,PLAYERS.,"For cause of comfort, where no comfort lies;"
4149,PLAYERS.,Then to her task she sighing turns again -
4150,PLAYERS.,"""Oh! Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!"""
4151,PLAYERS.,"And who that poor, consumptive, wither'd thing,"
4152,PLAYERS.,Who strains her slender throat and strives to sing?
4153,PLAYERS.,"Panting for breath and forced her voice to drop,"
4154,PLAYERS.,"And far unlike the inmate of the shop,"
4155,PLAYERS.,"Where she, in youth and health, alert and gay,"
4156,PLAYERS.,Laugh'd off at night the labours of the day;
4157,PLAYERS.,"With novels, verses, fancy's fertile powers,"
4158,PLAYERS.,And sister-converse pass'd the evening hours:
4159,PLAYERS.,"But Cynthia's soul was soft, her wishes strong,"
4160,PLAYERS.,"Her judgment weak, and her conclusions wrong;"
4161,PLAYERS.,"The morning-call and counter were her dread,"
4162,PLAYERS.,And her contempt the needle and the thread:
4163,PLAYERS.,"But when she read a gentle damsel's part,"
4164,PLAYERS.,"Her woe, her wish! she had them all by heart."
4165,PLAYERS.,"At length the hero of the boards drew nigh,"
4166,PLAYERS.,Who spake of love till sigh re-echo'd sigh;
4167,PLAYERS.,"He told in honey'd words his deathless flame,"
4168,PLAYERS.,And she his own by tender vows became;
4169,PLAYERS.,"Nor ring nor licence needed souls so fond,"
4170,PLAYERS.,Alfonso's passion was his Cynthia's bond:
4171,PLAYERS.,"And thus the simple girl, to shame betray'd,"
4172,PLAYERS.,Sinks to the grave forsaken and dismay'd.
4173,PLAYERS.,"Sick without pity, sorrowing without hope,"
4174,PLAYERS.,See her! the grief and scandal of the troop;
4175,PLAYERS.,"A wretched martyr to a childish pride,"
4176,PLAYERS.,"Her woe insulted, and her praise denied:"
4177,PLAYERS.,"Her humble talents, though derided, used,"
4178,PLAYERS.,"Her prospects lost, her confidence abused;"
4179,PLAYERS.,All that remains--for she not long can brave
4180,PLAYERS.,Increase of evils--is an early grave.
4181,PLAYERS.,"Ye gentle Cynthias of the shop, take heed"
4182,PLAYERS.,"What dreams you cherish, and what books ye read!"
4183,PLAYERS.,"A decent sum had Peter Nottage made,"
4184,PLAYERS.,By joining bricks--to him a thriving trade:
4185,PLAYERS.,"Of his employment master and his wife,"
4186,PLAYERS.,This humble tradesman led a lordly life;
4187,PLAYERS.,"The house of kings and heroes lack'd repairs,"
4188,PLAYERS.,"And Peter, though reluctant, served the Players:"
4189,PLAYERS.,"Connected thus, he heard in way polite, -"
4190,PLAYERS.,"""Come, Master Nottage, see us play to night,"""
4191,PLAYERS.,"At first 'twas folly, nonsense, idle stuff,"
4192,PLAYERS.,But seen for nothing it grew well enough;
4193,PLAYERS.,"And better now--now best, and every night,"
4194,PLAYERS.,In this fool's paradise he drank delight;
4195,PLAYERS.,"And as he felt the bliss, he wish'd to know"
4196,PLAYERS.,Whence all this rapture and these joys could flow;
4197,PLAYERS.,"For if the seeing could such pleasure bring,"
4198,PLAYERS.,What must the feeling?--feeling like a king?
4199,PLAYERS.,"In vain his wife, his uncle, and his friend,"
4200,PLAYERS.,"Cried--""Peter! Peter! let such follies end;"
4201,PLAYERS.,"'Tis well enough these vagabonds to see,"
4202,PLAYERS.,"But would you partner with a showman be?"""
4203,PLAYERS.,"""Showman!"" said Peter, ""did not Quin and Clive,"
4204,PLAYERS.,"And Roscius-Garrick, by the science thrive?"
4205,PLAYERS.,Showman!--'tis scandal; I'm by genius led
4206,PLAYERS.,"To join a class who've Shakspeare at their head."""
4207,PLAYERS.,Poor Peter thus by easy steps became
4208,PLAYERS.,"A dreaming candidate for scenic fame,"
4209,PLAYERS.,"And, after years consumed, infirm and poor,"
4210,PLAYERS.,He sits and takes the tickets at the door.
4211,PLAYERS.,"Of various men these marching troops are made, -"
4212,PLAYERS.,"Pen-spurning clerks, and lads contemning trade;"
4213,PLAYERS.,"Waiters and servants by confinement teased,"
4214,PLAYERS.,And youths of wealth by dissipation eased;
4215,PLAYERS.,"With feeling nymphs, who, such resource at hand,"
4216,PLAYERS.,Scorn to obey the rigour of command;
4217,PLAYERS.,"Some, who from higher views by vice are won,"
4218,PLAYERS.,And some of either sex by love undone;
4219,PLAYERS.,"The greater part lamenting as their fall,"
4220,PLAYERS.,What some an honour and advancement call.
4221,PLAYERS.,"There are who names in shame or fear assume,"
4222,PLAYERS.,And hence our Bevilles and our Savilles come;
4223,PLAYERS.,"It honours him, from tailor's board kick'd down,"
4224,PLAYERS.,As Mister Dormer to amuse the town;
4225,PLAYERS.,"Falling, he rises:  but a kind there are"
4226,PLAYERS.,"Who dwell on former prospects, and despair;"
4227,PLAYERS.,"Justly but vainly they their fate deplore,"
4228,PLAYERS.,"And mourn their fall, who fell to rise no more."
4229,PLAYERS.,"Our merchant Thompson, with his sons around,"
4230,PLAYERS.,Most mind and talent in his Frederick found:
4231,PLAYERS.,"He was so lively, that his mother knew,"
4232,PLAYERS.,"If he were taught, that honour must ensue;"
4233,PLAYERS.,"The father's views were in a different line, -"
4234,PLAYERS.,But if at college he were sure to shine.
4235,PLAYERS.,Then should he go--to prosper who could doubt?
4236,PLAYERS.,"When schoolboy stigmas would be all wash'd out,"
4237,PLAYERS.,"For there were marks upon his youthful face,"
4238,PLAYERS.,'Twixt vice and error--a neglected case -
4239,PLAYERS.,"These would submit to skill; a little time,"
4240,PLAYERS.,And none could trace the error or the crime;
4241,PLAYERS.,"Then let him go, and once at college, he"
4242,PLAYERS.,Might choose his station--what would Frederick be.
4243,PLAYERS.,'Twas soon determined--He could not descend
4244,PLAYERS.,To pedant-laws and lectures without end;
4245,PLAYERS.,"And then the chapel--night and morn to pray,"
4246,PLAYERS.,Or mulct and threaten'd if he kept away;
4247,PLAYERS.,"No! not to be a bishop--so he swore,"
4248,PLAYERS.,And at his college he was seen no more.
4249,PLAYERS.,"His debts all paid, the father, with a sigh,"
4250,PLAYERS.,"Placed him in office--""Do, my Frederick, try:"
4251,PLAYERS.,"Confine thyself a few short months and then -"""
4252,PLAYERS.,"He tried a fortnight, and threw down the pen."
4253,PLAYERS.,"Again demands were hush'd:  ""My son, you're free,"
4254,PLAYERS.,"But you're unsettled; take your chance at sea:"""
4255,PLAYERS.,"So in few days the midshipman, equipp'd"
4256,PLAYERS.,"Received the mother's blessing, and was shipp'd."
4257,PLAYERS.,Hard was her fortune! soon compell'd to meet
4258,PLAYERS.,The wretched stripling staggering through the street;
4259,PLAYERS.,"For, rash, impetuous, insolent, and vain,"
4260,PLAYERS.,The Captain sent him to his friends again:
4261,PLAYERS.,"About the Borough roved th' unnappy boy,"
4262,PLAYERS.,And ate the bread of every chance-employ!
4263,PLAYERS.,"Of friends he borrow'd, and the parents yet"
4264,PLAYERS.,In secret fondness authorized the debt;
4265,PLAYERS.,"The younger sister, still a child, was taught"
4266,PLAYERS.,To give with feign'd affright the pittance sought;
4267,PLAYERS.,"For now the father cried--""It is too late"
4268,PLAYERS.,"For trial more--I leave him to his fate,"" -"
4269,PLAYERS.,"Yet left him not:  and with a kind of joy,"
4270,PLAYERS.,The mother heard of her desponding boy;
4271,PLAYERS.,"At length he sicken'd, and he found, when sick,"
4272,PLAYERS.,"All aid was ready, all attendance quick;"
4273,PLAYERS.,"A fever seized him, and at once was lost"
4274,PLAYERS.,"The thought of trespass, error, crime, and cost:"
4275,PLAYERS.,"Th' indulgent parents, knelt beside the youth,"
4276,PLAYERS.,They heard his promise and believed his truth;
4277,PLAYERS.,"And when the danger lessen'd on their view,"
4278,PLAYERS.,"They cast off doubt, and hope assurance grew; -"
4279,PLAYERS.,"Nursed by his sisters, cherish'd by his sire,"
4280,PLAYERS.,"Begg'd to be glad, encouraged to aspire,"
4281,PLAYERS.,"His life, they said, would now all care repay,"
4282,PLAYERS.,And he might date his prospects from that day;
4283,PLAYERS.,"A son, a brother to his home received,"
4284,PLAYERS.,"They hoped for all things, and in all believed."
4285,PLAYERS.,"And now will pardon, comfort, kindness draw"
4286,PLAYERS.,"The youth from vice? will honour, duty, law?"
4287,PLAYERS.,"Alas! not all:  the more the trials lent,"
4288,PLAYERS.,The less he seem'd to ponder and repent;
4289,PLAYERS.,"Headstrong, determined in his own career,"
4290,PLAYERS.,He thought reproof unjust and truth severe;
4291,PLAYERS.,"The soul's disease was to its crisis come,"
4292,PLAYERS.,He first abused and then abjured his home;
4293,PLAYERS.,"And when he chose a vagabond to be,"
4294,PLAYERS.,"He made his shame his glory--""I'll be free."""
4295,PLAYERS.,"Friends, parents, relatives, hope, reason, love,"
4296,PLAYERS.,With anxious ardour for that empire strove;
4297,PLAYERS.,"In vain their strife, in vain the means applied,"
4298,PLAYERS.,"They had no comfort, but that all were tried;"
4299,PLAYERS.,"One strong vain trial made, the mind to move,"
4300,PLAYERS.,Was the last effort of parental love.
4301,PLAYERS.,"E'en then he watch'd his father from his home,"
4302,PLAYERS.,"And to his mother would for pity come,"
4303,PLAYERS.,"Where, as he made her tender terrors rise,"
4304,PLAYERS.,"He talk'd of death, and threaten'd for supplies."
4305,PLAYERS.,"Against a youth so vicious and undone,"
4306,PLAYERS.,"All hearts were closed, and every door but one:"
4307,PLAYERS.,The Players received him; they with open heart
4308,PLAYERS.,Gave him his portion and assign'd his part;
4309,PLAYERS.,"And ere three days were added to his life,"
4310,PLAYERS.,"He found a home, a duty, and a wife."
4311,PLAYERS.,"His present friends, though they were nothing nice,"
4312,PLAYERS.,"Nor ask'd how vicious he, or what his vice,"
4313,PLAYERS.,Still they expected he should now attend
4314,PLAYERS.,To the joint duty as a useful friend;
4315,PLAYERS.,"The leader too declared, with frown severe,"
4316,PLAYERS.,That none should pawn a robe that kings might wear;
4317,PLAYERS.,"And much it moved him, when he Hamlet play'd,"
4318,PLAYERS.,To see his Father's Ghost so drunken made:
4319,PLAYERS.,"Then too the temper, the unbending pride"
4320,PLAYERS.,"Of this ally, would no reproof abide:  -"
4321,PLAYERS.,"So leaving these, he march'd away and join'd"
4322,PLAYERS.,"Another troop, and other goods purloin'd;"
4323,PLAYERS.,"And other characters, both gay and sage,"
4324,PLAYERS.,"Sober and sad, made stagger on the stage."
4325,PLAYERS.,"Then to rebuke with arrogant disdain,"
4326,PLAYERS.,"He gave abuse, and sought a home again."
4327,PLAYERS.,"Thus changing scenes, but with unchanging vice,"
4328,PLAYERS.,"Engaged by many, but with no one twice:"
4329,PLAYERS.,"Of this, a last and poor resource, bereft,"
4330,PLAYERS.,"He to himself, unhappy guide! was left -"
4331,PLAYERS.,And who shall say where guided? to what seats
4332,PLAYERS.,Of starving villany? of thieves and cheats?
4333,PLAYERS.,In that sad time of many a dismal scene
4334,PLAYERS.,"Had he a witness, not inactive, been;"
4335,PLAYERS.,"Had leagued with petty pilferers, and had crept"
4336,PLAYERS.,Where of each sex degraded numbers slept:
4337,PLAYERS.,"With such associates he was long allied,"
4338,PLAYERS.,"Where his capacity for ill was tried,"
4339,PLAYERS.,"And that once lost, the wretch was cast aside,"
4340,PLAYERS.,"For now, though willing with the worst to act,"
4341,PLAYERS.,He wanted powers for an important fact;
4342,PLAYERS.,"And while he felt as lawless spirits feel,"
4343,PLAYERS.,"His hand was palsied, and he couldn't steal."
4344,PLAYERS.,"By these rejected, is their lot so strange,"
4345,PLAYERS.,So low! that he could suffer by the change?
4346,PLAYERS.,"Yes! the new station as a fall we judge, -"
4347,PLAYERS.,"He now became the harlots' humble drudge,"
4348,PLAYERS.,Their drudge in common; they combined to save
4349,PLAYERS.,Awhile from starving their submissive slave;
4350,PLAYERS.,"For now his spirit left him, and his pride,"
4351,PLAYERS.,"His scorn, his rancour, and resentment died;"
4352,PLAYERS.,"Few were his feelings--but the keenest these,"
4353,PLAYERS.,"The rage of hunger, and the sigh for ease;"
4354,PLAYERS.,"He who abused indulgence, now became"
4355,PLAYERS.,"By want subservient, and by misery tame;"
4356,PLAYERS.,"A slave, he begg'd forbearance; bent with pain,"
4357,PLAYERS.,"He shunn'd the blow,--""Ah! strike me not again,"""
4358,PLAYERS.,Thus was he found:  the master of a hoy
4359,PLAYERS.,Saw the sad wretch whom he had known a boy;
4360,PLAYERS.,"At first in doubt, but Frederick laid aside"
4361,PLAYERS.,"All shame, and humbly for his aid applied:"
4362,PLAYERS.,"He, tamed and smitten with the storms gone by,"
4363,PLAYERS.,"Look'd for compassion through one living eye,"
4364,PLAYERS.,And stretch'd th' unpalsied hand:  the seaman felt
4365,PLAYERS.,"His honest heart with gentle pity melt,"
4366,PLAYERS.,And his small boon with cheerful frankness dealt;
4367,PLAYERS.,"Then made inquiries of th' unhappy youth,"
4368,PLAYERS.,"Who told, nor shame forbade him, all the truth."
4369,PLAYERS.,"""Young Frederick Thompson, to a chandler's shop"
4370,PLAYERS.,"By harlots order'd, and afraid to stop! -"
4371,PLAYERS.,What! our good merchant's favourite to be seen
4372,PLAYERS.,"In state so loathsome and in dress so mean?"" -"
4373,PLAYERS.,"So thought the seaman as he bade adieu,"
4374,PLAYERS.,"And, when in port, related all he knew."
4375,PLAYERS.,"But time was lost, inquiry came too late,"
4376,PLAYERS.,Those whom he served knew nothing of his fate;
4377,PLAYERS.,"No! they had seized on what the sailor gave,"
4378,PLAYERS.,Nor bore resistance from their abject slave.
4379,PLAYERS.,"The spoil obtain'd they cast him from the door,"
4380,PLAYERS.,"Robb'd, beaten, hungry, pain'd, diseas'd, and poor."
4381,PLAYERS.,"Then nature, pointing to the only spot"
4382,PLAYERS.,"Which still had comfort for so dire a lot,"
4383,PLAYERS.,"Although so feeble, led him on the way,"
4384,PLAYERS.,And hope look'd forward to a happier day:
4385,PLAYERS.,"He thought, poor prodigal! a father yet"
4386,PLAYERS.,His woes would pity and his crimes forget;
4387,PLAYERS.,Nor had he brother who with speech severe
4388,PLAYERS.,Would check the pity or refrain the tear:
4389,PLAYERS.,"A lighter spirit in his bosom rose,"
4390,PLAYERS.,As near the road he sought an hour's repose.
4391,PLAYERS.,"And there he found it:  he had left the town,"
4392,PLAYERS.,But buildings yet were scatter'd up and down;
4393,PLAYERS.,"To one of these, half-ruin'd and half-built,"
4394,PLAYERS.,Was traced this child of wretchedness and guilt;
4395,PLAYERS.,"There, on the remnant of a beggar's vest,"
4396,PLAYERS.,"Thrown by in scorn, the sufferer sought for rest;"
4397,PLAYERS.,"There was this scene of vice and woe to close,"
4398,PLAYERS.,And there the wretched body found repose.  {5}

4885,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"His was no more a youthful dream of joy,"

4891,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"""But did not conscience in her anger rise?"""
4892,LIFE OF BLANEY.,Yes! and he learn'd her terrors to despise;
4893,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"When stung by thought, to soothing books he fled,"

4895,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"Tales of Voltaire, and essays gay and slight."

4897,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"Which, though it rose from objects vile and base,"

4901,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"He different works for different cause admired,"
4902,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"Some fix'd his judgment, some his passions fired;"

4906,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"These won to vicious act the yielding heart,"
4907,LIFE OF BLANEY.,And then the cooler reasoners soothed the smart.
4908,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"He heard of Blount, and Mandeville, and Chubb,"

4913,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"He caught their faith, and sign'd the sinner's creed."
4914,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"Thus was he pleased to join the laughing side,"
4915,LIFE OF BLANEY.,Nor ceased the laughter when his lady died;
4916,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"Yet was he kind and careful of her fame,"
4917,LIFE OF BLANEY.,And on her tomb inscribed a virtuous name;
4918,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"""A tender wife, respected, and so forth,"""
4919,LIFE OF BLANEY.,The marble still bears witness to the worth.
4920,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"He has some children, but he knows not where;"

4922,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"A father's feelings he has never known,"
4923,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"His joys, his sorrows, have been all his own."
4924,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"He now would build, and lofty seat he built,"

4926,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"Restless, for ever anxious to obtain"
4927,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"Ease for the heart by ramblings of the brain,"
4928,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"He would have pictures, and of course a Taste,"

4930,LIFE OF BLANEY.,Newmarket steeds he bought at mighty cost;
4931,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"They sometimes won, but Blaney always lost."
4932,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"Quick came his ruin, came when he had still"

4943,LIFE OF BLANEY.,Gave it an opera-bird to hum an air.
4944,LIFE OF BLANEY.,"Come ye! who live for Pleasure, come, behold"

5138,CLELIA.,"How to make all the passions his allies,"

5141,CLELIA.,Our heroine fear'd him not; it was her part
5142,CLELIA.,To make sure conquest of such gentle heart -

5144,CLELIA.,In Henry's eye a love chastised by awe.
5145,CLELIA.,"Her thoughts of virtue were not all sublime,"
5146,CLELIA.,Nor virtuous all her thoughts; 'twas now her time
5147,CLELIA.,"To bait each hook, in every way to please,"
5148,CLELIA.,And the rich prize with dext'rous hand to seize.
5149,CLELIA.,She had no virgin-terrors; she could stray
5150,CLELIA.,"In all love's maze, nor fear to lose her way;"
5151,CLELIA.,"Nay, could go near the precipiee, nor dread"
5152,CLELIA.,A failing caution or a giddy head;

5157,CLELIA.,"To be about to take, and then command"

5163,CLELIA.,The young and tender germ requires the sun

5166,CLELIA.,"To gain a heart so fond, a hand so prized;"
5167,CLELIA.,"More gentle still she grew, to change her way"

5170,CLELIA.,"She took a plain, unvaried, certain road,"

5172,CLELIA.,Till there was nothing left to hope or fear.
5173,CLELIA.,"It must be own'd that, in this strife of hearts,"

5341,BENBOW.,These were his friends--his foes conceived the case
5342,BENBOW.,Of common kind; he sought and found disgrace:
5343,BENBOW.,"The reasoning few, who neither scorn'd nor loved,"
5344,BENBOW.,His feelings pitied and his faults reproved.
5345,BENBOW.,"Benbow, the father, left possessions fair,"
5346,BENBOW.,A worthy name and business to his heir;
5347,BENBOW.,"Benbow, the son, those fair possessions sold,"
5348,BENBOW.,"And lost his credit, while he spent the gold:"
5349,BENBOW.,He was a jovial trader:  men enjoy'd
5350,BENBOW.,The night with him; his day was unemployed;
5351,BENBOW.,"So when his credit and his cash were spent,"
5352,BENBOW.,"Here, by mistaken pity, he was sent;"
5353,BENBOW.,"Of late he came, with passions unsubdued,"
5354,BENBOW.,"And shared and cursed the hated solitude,"
5355,BENBOW.,"Where gloomy thoughts arise, where grievous cares intrude."
5356,BENBOW.,"Known but in drink,--he found an easy friend,"
5357,BENBOW.,Well pleased his worth and honour to commend:
5358,BENBOW.,"And thus inform'd, the guardian of the trust"
5359,BENBOW.,"Heard the applause, and said the claim was just,"
5360,BENBOW.,"A worthy soul! unfitted for the strife,"
5361,BENBOW.,"Care, and contention of a busy life; -"
5362,BENBOW.,"Worthy, and why?--that o'er the midnight bowl"
5363,BENBOW.,"He made his friend the partner of his soul,"
5364,BENBOW.,"And any man his friend: --then thus in glee,"
5365,BENBOW.,"""I speak my mind, I love the truth,"" quoth he;"
5366,BENBOW.,"Till 'twas his fate that useful truth to find,"
5367,BENBOW.,'Tis sometimes prudent not to speak the mind.
5368,BENBOW.,"With wine inflated, man is all upblown,"
5369,BENBOW.,And feels a power which he believes his own;
5370,BENBOW.,"With fancy soaring to the skies, he thinks"
5371,BENBOW.,His all the virtues all the while he drinks;
5372,BENBOW.,"But when the gas from the balloon is gone,"
5373,BENBOW.,"When sober thoughts and serious cares come on,"
5374,BENBOW.,Where then the worth that in himself he found?
5375,BENBOW.,Vanish'd--and he sank grov'lling on the ground.
5376,BENBOW.,"Still some conceit will Benbow's mind inflate,"
5377,BENBOW.,"Poor as he is,--'tis pleasant to relate"
5378,BENBOW.,The joys he once possess'd--it soothes his present state.
5379,BENBOW.,"Seated with some gray beadsman, he regrets"
5380,BENBOW.,"His former feasting, though it swell'd his debts;"
5381,BENBOW.,"Topers once famed, his friends in earlier days,"
5382,BENBOW.,"Well he describes, and thinks description praise:"
5383,BENBOW.,Each hero's worth with much delight he paints;
5384,BENBOW.,"Martyrs they were, and he would make them saints."
5385,BENBOW.,"""Alas! alas!"" Old England now may say,"
5386,BENBOW.,"""My glory withers; it has had its day:"
5387,BENBOW.,We're fallen on evil times; men read and think;
5388,BENBOW.,Our bold forefathers loved to fight and drink.
5389,BENBOW.,"""Then lived the good 'Squire Asgill--what a change"
5390,BENBOW.,Has death and fashion shown us at the Grange!
5391,BENBOW.,He bravely thought it best became his rank
5392,BENBOW.,That all his tenants and his tradesmen drank;
5393,BENBOW.,He was delighted from his favourite room
5394,BENBOW.,To see them 'cross the park go daily home
5395,BENBOW.,"Praising aloud the liquor and the host,"
5396,BENBOW.,And striving who should venerate him most.
5397,BENBOW.,"""No pride had he, and there was difference small"
5398,BENBOW.,Between the master's and the servant's hall:
5399,BENBOW.,And here or there the guests were welcome all.
5400,BENBOW.,"Of Heaven's free gifts he took no special care,"
5401,BENBOW.,He never quarrell'd for a simple hare;
5402,BENBOW.,"But sought, by giving sport, a sportman's name,"
5403,BENBOW.,"Himself a poacher, though at other game:"
5404,BENBOW.,He never planted nor inclosed--his trees
5405,BENBOW.,"Grew, like himself, untroubled and at ease:"
5406,BENBOW.,"Bounds of all kinds he hated, and had felt"
5407,BENBOW.,"Chok'd and imprison'd in a modern belt,"
5408,BENBOW.,Which some rare genius now has twined about
5409,BENBOW.,"The good old house, to keep old neighbours out."
5410,BENBOW.,"Along his valleys, in the evening-hours,"
5411,BENBOW.,"The borough-damsels stray'd to gather flowers,"
5412,BENBOW.,"Or by the brakes and brushwood of the park,"
5413,BENBOW.,To take their pleasant rambles in the dark.
5414,BENBOW.,"""Some prudes, of rigid kind, forbore to call"
5415,BENBOW.,On the kind females--favourites at the hall;
5416,BENBOW.,"But better nature saw, with much delight,"
5417,BENBOW.,The different orders of mankind unite:
5418,BENBOW.,"'Twas schooling pride to see the footman wait,"
5419,BENBOW.,Smile on his sister and receive her plate.
5420,BENBOW.,"""His worship ever was a churchman true,"
5421,BENBOW.,He held in scorn the Methodistic crew;
5422,BENBOW.,"'May God defend the Church, and save the King,'"
5423,BENBOW.,He'd pray devoutly and divinely sing.
5424,BENBOW.,Admit that he the holy day would spend
5425,BENBOW.,"As priests approved not, still he was a friend:"
5426,BENBOW.,"Much then I blame the preacher, as too nice,"
5427,BENBOW.,To call such trifles by the name of vice;
5428,BENBOW.,"Hinting, though gently and with cautious speech,"
5429,BENBOW.,Of good example--'tis their trade to preach.
5430,BENBOW.,"But still 'twas pity, when the worthy 'squire"
5431,BENBOW.,"Stuck to the church, what more could they require?"
5432,BENBOW.,"'Twas almost joining that fanatic crew,"
5433,BENBOW.,To throw such morals at his honour's pew;
5434,BENBOW.,"A weaker man, had he been so reviled,"
5435,BENBOW.,Had left the place--he only swore and smiled.
5436,BENBOW.,"""But think, ye rectors and ye curates, think,"
5437,BENBOW.,"Who are your friends, and at their frailties wink;"
5438,BENBOW.,"Conceive not--mounted on your Sunday-throne,"
5439,BENBOW.,Your firebrands fall upon your foes alone;
5440,BENBOW.,"They strike your patrons--and should all withdraw,"
5441,BENBOW.,"In whom your wisdoms may discern a flaw,"
5442,BENBOW.,"You would the flower of all your audience lose,"
5443,BENBOW.,And spend your crackers on their empty pews.
5444,BENBOW.,"""The father dead, the son has found a wife,"
5445,BENBOW.,"And lives a formal, proud, unsocial life; -"
5446,BENBOW.,"The lands are now inclosed; the tenants all,"
5447,BENBOW.,"Save at a rent-day, never see the hall;"
5448,BENBOW.,"No lass is suffer'd o'er the walks to come,"
5449,BENBOW.,"And if there's love, they have it all at home."
5450,BENBOW.,"""Oh! could the ghost of our good 'squire arise,"
5451,BENBOW.,And see such change; would it believe its eyes?
5452,BENBOW.,"Would it not glide about from place to place,"
5453,BENBOW.,And mourn the manners of a feebler race?
5454,BENBOW.,"At that long table, where the servants found"
5455,BENBOW.,Mirth and abundance while the year went round;
5456,BENBOW.,"Where a huge pollard on the winter-fire,"
5457,BENBOW.,At a huge distance made them all retire;
5458,BENBOW.,"Where not a measure in the room was kept,"
5459,BENBOW.,And but one rule--they tippled till they slept -
5460,BENBOW.,"There would it see a pale old hag preside,"
5461,BENBOW.,A thing made up of stinginess and pride;
5462,BENBOW.,"Who carves the meat, as if the flesh could feel;"
5463,BENBOW.,Careless whose flesh must miss the plenteous meal;
5464,BENBOW.,"Here would the ghost a small coal-fire behold,"
5465,BENBOW.,Not fit to keep one body from the cold;
5466,BENBOW.,"Then would it flit to higher rooms, and stay"
5467,BENBOW.,"To view a dull, dress'd company at play;"
5468,BENBOW.,"All the old comfort, all the genial fare"
5469,BENBOW.,For ever gone! how sternly would it stare:
5470,BENBOW.,"And though it might not to their view appear,"
5471,BENBOW.,'Twould cause among them lassitude and fear
5472,BENBOW.,Then wait to see--where he delight has seen -
5473,BENBOW.,The dire effect of fretfulness and spleen.
5474,BENBOW.,"""Such were the worthies of these better days;"
5475,BENBOW.,We had their blessings--they shall have our praise.
5476,BENBOW.,"""Of Captain Dowling would you hear me speak?"
5477,BENBOW.,I'd sit and sing his praises for a week:
5478,BENBOW.,"He was a man, and man-like all his joy, -"
5479,BENBOW.,I'm led to question was he ever boy?
5480,BENBOW.,"Beef was his breakfast;--if from sea and salt,"
5481,BENBOW.,It relish'd better with his wine of malt;
5482,BENBOW.,"Then, till he dined, if walking in or out,"
5483,BENBOW.,"Whether the gravel teased him or the gout,"
5484,BENBOW.,"Though short in wind and flannell'd every limb,"
5485,BENBOW.,He drank with all who had concerns with him:
5486,BENBOW.,"Whatever trader, agent, merchant, came,"
5487,BENBOW.,"They found him ready, every hour the same;"
5488,BENBOW.,"Whatever liquors might between them pass,"
5489,BENBOW.,"He took them all, and never balk'd his glass:"
5490,BENBOW.,"Nay, with the seamen working in the ship,"
5491,BENBOW.,"At their request, he'd share the grog and flip."
5492,BENBOW.,"But in the club-room was his chief delight,"
5493,BENBOW.,And punch the favourite liquor of the night;
5494,BENBOW.,"Man after man they from the trial shrank,"
5495,BENBOW.,And Dowling ever was the last who drank:
5496,BENBOW.,"Arrived at home, he, ere he sought his bed,"
5497,BENBOW.,"With pipe and brandy would compose his head,"
5498,BENBOW.,"Then half an hour was o'er the news beguiled,"
5499,BENBOW.,When he retired as harmless as a child.
5500,BENBOW.,Set but aside the gravel and the gout.
5501,BENBOW.,And breathing short--his sand ran fairly out.
5502,BENBOW.,"""At fifty-five we lost him--after that"
5503,BENBOW.,Life grows insipid and its pleasures flat;
5504,BENBOW.,"He had indulged in all that man can have,"
5505,BENBOW.,He did not drop a dotard to his grave;
5506,BENBOW.,"Still to the last, his feet upon the chair,"
5507,BENBOW.,With rattling lungs now gone beyond repair;
5508,BENBOW.,"When on each feature death had fix'd his stamp,"
5509,BENBOW.,And not a doctor could the body vamp;
5510,BENBOW.,"Still at the last, to his beloved bowl"
5511,BENBOW.,"He clung, and cheer'd the sadness of his soul;"
5512,BENBOW.,"For though a man may not have much to fear,"
5513,BENBOW.,Yet death looks ugly when the view is near:
5514,BENBOW.,"- 'I go,' he said, 'but still my friends shall say,"
5515,BENBOW.,'Twas as a man--I did not sneak away;
5516,BENBOW.,"An honest life with worthy souls I've spent, -"
5517,BENBOW.,"Come, fill my glass;' he took it and he went."
5518,BENBOW.,"""Poor Dolly Murray!--I might live to see"
5519,BENBOW.,"My hundredth year, but no such lass as she."
5520,BENBOW.,"Easy by nature, in her humour gay,"
5521,BENBOW.,"She chose her comforts, ratafia and play:"
5522,BENBOW.,"She loved the social game, the decent glass,"
5523,BENBOW.,"And was a jovial, friendly, laughing lass;"
5524,BENBOW.,"We sat not then at Whist demure and still,"
5525,BENBOW.,But pass'd the pleasant hours at gay Quadrille:
5526,BENBOW.,"Lame in her side, we plac'd her in her seat,"
5527,BENBOW.,"Her hands were free, she cared not for her feet;"
5528,BENBOW.,"As the game ended, came the glass around"
5529,BENBOW.,"(So was the loser cheer'd, the winner crown'd)."
5530,BENBOW.,"Mistress of secrets, both the young and old"
5531,BENBOW.,In her confided--not a tale she told;
5532,BENBOW.,"Love never made impression on her mind,"
5533,BENBOW.,"She held him weak, and all his captives blind;"
5534,BENBOW.,"She suffer'd no man her free soul to vex,"
5535,BENBOW.,Free from the weakness of her gentle sex;
5536,BENBOW.,"One with whom ours unmoved conversing sate,"
5537,BENBOW.,In cool discussion or in free debate.
5538,BENBOW.,"""Once in her chair we'd placed the good old lass,"
5539,BENBOW.,Where first she took her preparation-glass;
5540,BENBOW.,"By lucky thought she'd been that day at prayers,"
5541,BENBOW.,"And long before had fix'd her small affairs,"
5542,BENBOW.,So all was easy--on her cards she cast
5543,BENBOW.,A smiling look; I saw the thought that pass'd:
5544,BENBOW.,"'A king,' she call'd--though conscious of her skill."
5545,BENBOW.,"'Do more,' I answer'd--'More,' she said, 'I will;'"
5546,BENBOW.,"And more she did--cards answer'd to her call,"
5547,BENBOW.,She saw the mighty to her mightier fall:
5548,BENBOW.,"'A vole! a vole!' she cried, ''tis fairly won,"
5549,BENBOW.,My game is ended and my work is done;' -
5550,BENBOW.,"This said, she gently, with a single sigh,"
5551,BENBOW.,Died as one taught and practised how to die.
5552,BENBOW.,"""Such were the dead-departed; I survive,"
5553,BENBOW.,"To breathe in pain among the dead-alive."""
5554,BENBOW.,"The bell then call'd these ancient men to pray,"
5555,BENBOW.,"""Again!"" said Benbow,--""tolls it every day?"
5556,BENBOW.,"Where is the life I led?""--He sigh'd and walk'd his way. {7}"

5732,THE HOSPITAL AND GOVERNORS.,"His daintiest food, his richest wines, were all"

6362,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The Parish-Clerk began his Duties with the late Vicar, a grave and"
6363,THE PARISH-CLERK.,austere Man; one fully orthodox; a Detecter and Opposer of the Wiles
6364,THE PARISH-CLERK.,of Satan--His opinion of his own Fortitude--The more frail offended

6372,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"WITH our late Vicar, and his age the same,"
6373,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"His clerk, hight Jachin, to his office came;"
6374,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The like slow speech was his, the like tall slender frame:"
6375,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But Jachin was the gravest man on ground,"
6376,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And heard his master's jokes with look profound;
6377,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"For worldly wealth this man of letters sigh'd,"
6378,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And had a sprinkling of the spirit's pride:
6379,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But he was sober, chaste, devout and just,"
6380,THE PARISH-CLERK.,One whom his neighbours could believe and trust:
6381,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Of none suspected, neither man nor maid"
6382,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"By him were wrong'd, or were of him afraid."
6383,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"There was indeed a frown, a trick of state"
6384,THE PARISH-CLERK.,In Jachin;--formal was his air and gait:
6385,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But if he seem'd more solemn and less kind,"
6386,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Than some light men to light affairs confined,"
6387,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Still 'twas allow'd that he should so behave
6388,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"As in high seat, and be severely grave."
6389,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"This book-taught man, to man's first foe profess'd"
6390,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Defiance stern, and hate that knew not rest;"
6391,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He held that Satan, since the world began,"
6392,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"In every act, had strife with every man;"
6393,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"That never evil deed on earth was done,"

6395,THE PARISH-CLERK.,The flattering guide to make ill prospects clear;
6396,THE PARISH-CLERK.,To smooth rough ways the constant pioneer;
6397,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The ever-tempting, soothing, softening power,"
6398,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Ready to cheat, seduce, deceive, devour."
6399,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""Me has the sly Seducer oft withstood,"""

6411,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""At feasts and banquets seldom am I found,"

6414,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And where my master goes, forbear to go."""
6415,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"No wonder Satan took the thing amiss,"
6416,THE PARISH-CLERK.,To be opposed by such a man as this -
6417,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"A man so grave, important, cautious, wise,"
6418,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Who dared not trust his feeling or his eyes;
6419,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"No wonder he should lurk and lie in wait,"
6420,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Should fit his hooks and ponder on his bait;
6421,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Should on his movements keep a watchful eye;
6422,THE PARISH-CLERK.,For he pursued a fish who led the fry.
6423,THE PARISH-CLERK.,With his own peace our Clerk was not content;
6424,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He tried, good man! to make his friends repent."
6425,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""Nay, nay, my friends, from inns and taverns fly;"
6426,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"You may suppress your thirst, but not supply:"
6427,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"A foolish proverb says, 'the devil's at home;'"

6429,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Men feel, they know not why, such places please;"
6430,THE PARISH-CLERK.,His are the spells--they're idleness and ease;
6431,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Magic of fatal kind he throws around,"
6432,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Where care is banish'd, but the heart is bound."
6433,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""Think not of beauty;--when a maid you meet,"
6434,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Turn from her view and step across the street;
6435,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Dread all the sex:  their looks create a charm,"
6436,THE PARISH-CLERK.,A smile should fright you and a word alarm:
6437,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"E'en I myself, with all my watchful care,"
6438,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Have for an instant felt the insidious snare;
6439,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And caught my sinful eyes at the endang'ring stars;
6440,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Till I was forced to smite my bounding breast
6441,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"With forceful blow, and bid the bold-one rest."
6442,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""Go not with crowds when they to pleasure run,"
6443,THE PARISH-CLERK.,But public joy in private safety shun:
6444,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"When bells, diverted from their true intent,"
6445,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Ring loud for some deluded mortal sent
6446,THE PARISH-CLERK.,To hear or make long speech in parliament;
6447,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"What time the many, that unruly beast,"
6448,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Roars its rough joy and shares the final feast?
6449,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Then heed my counsel, shut thine ears and eyes;"
6450,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"A few will hear me--for the few are wise."""
6451,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Not Satan's friends, nor Satan's self could bear,"
6452,THE PARISH-CLERK.,The cautious man who took of souls such care;
6453,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"An interloper,--one who, out of place,"
6454,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Had volunteered upon the side of grace:
6455,THE PARISH-CLERK.,There was his master ready once a week
6456,THE PARISH-CLERK.,To give advice; what further need he seek?
6457,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""Amen, so be it:""--what had he to do"
6458,THE PARISH-CLERK.,With more than this?--'twas insolent and new;
6459,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And some determined on a way to see
6460,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"How frail he was, that so it might not be."
6461,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"First they essay'd to tempt our saint to sin,"
6462,THE PARISH-CLERK.,By points of doctrine argued at an inn;
6463,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Where he might warmly reason, deeply drink,"
6464,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Then lose all power to argue and to think.
6465,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"In vain they tried; he took the question up,"
6466,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Clear'd every doubt, and barely touch'd the cup:"
6467,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"By many a text he proved his doctrine sound,"
6468,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And look'd in triumph on the tempters round.
6469,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Next 'twas their care an artful lass to find,"
6470,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Who might consult him, as perplex'd in mind;"
6471,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"She they conceived might put her case with fears,"
6472,THE PARISH-CLERK.,With tender tremblings and seducing tears;
6473,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"She might such charms of various kind display,"
6474,THE PARISH-CLERK.,That he would feel their force and melt away:
6475,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"For why of nymphs such caution and such dread,"
6476,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Unless he felt, and fear'd to be misled?"
6477,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"She came, she spake:  he calmly heard her case,"
6478,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And plainly told her 'twas a want of grace;
6479,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Bade her ""such fancies and affections check,"
6480,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And wear a thicker muslin on her neck."""
6481,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Abased, his human foes the combat fled,"
6482,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And the stern clerk yet higher held his head.
6483,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"They were indeed a weak, impatient set,"
6484,THE PARISH-CLERK.,But their shrewd prompter had his engines yet;
6485,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Had various means to make a mortal trip,"
6486,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Who shunn'd a flowing bowl and rosy lip;
6487,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And knew a thousand ways his heart to move,"
6488,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Who flies from banquets and who laughs at love.
6489,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Thus far the playful Muse has lent her aid,"
6490,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But now departs, of graver theme afraid;"
6491,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Her may we seek in more appropriate time, -"
6492,THE PARISH-CLERK.,There is no jesting with distress and crime.
6493,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Our worthy Clerk had now arrived at fame,"
6494,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Such as but few in his degree might claim;
6495,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But he was poor, and wanted not the sense"
6496,THE PARISH-CLERK.,That lowly rates the praise without the pence:
6497,THE PARISH-CLERK.,He saw the common herd with reverence treat
6498,THE PARISH-CLERK.,The weakest burgess whom they chanced to meet;
6499,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"While few respected his exalted views,"
6500,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And all beheld his doublet and his shoes:
6501,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"None, when they meet, would to his parts allow"
6502,THE PARISH-CLERK.,(Save his poor boys) a hearing or a bow:
6503,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"To this false judgment of the vulgar mind,"
6504,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He was not fully, as a saint, resign'd;"
6505,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He found it much his jealous soul affect,"
6506,THE PARISH-CLERK.,To fear derision and to find neglect.
6507,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The year was bad, the christening-fees were small,"
6508,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The weddings few, the parties paupers all:"
6509,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Desire of gain with fear of want combined,"
6510,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Raised sad commotion in his wounded mind;
6511,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Wealth was in all his thoughts, his views, his dreams,"
6512,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And prompted base desires and baseless schemes.
6513,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Alas! how often erring mortals keep
6514,THE PARISH-CLERK.,The strongest watch against the foes who sleep;
6515,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"While the more wakeful, bold, and artful foe"
6516,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Is suffer'd guardless and unmark'd to go.
6517,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Once in a month the sacramental bread
6518,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Our Clerk with wine upon the table spread:
6519,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The custom this, that as the vicar reads,"
6520,THE PARISH-CLERK.,He for our off'rings round the church proceeds;
6521,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Tall spacious seats the wealthier people hid,"
6522,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And none had view of what his neighbour did:
6523,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Laid on the box and mingled when they fell,"
6524,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Who should the worth of each oblation tell?
6525,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Now as poor Jachin took the usual round,"
6526,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And saw the alms and heard the metal sound,"
6527,THE PARISH-CLERK.,He had a thought--at first it was no more
6528,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Than--""these have cash and give it to the poor."""
6529,THE PARISH-CLERK.,A second thought from this to work began -
6530,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""And can they give it to a poorer man?"""
6531,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Proceeding thus,--""My merit could they know;"
6532,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And knew my need, how freely they'd bestow;"
6533,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But though they know not, these remain the same,"
6534,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And are a strong, although a secret claim:"
6535,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"To me, alas! the want and worth are known;"
6536,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Why then, in fact, 'tis but to take my own."""
6537,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Thought after thought pour'd in, a tempting train:  -"
6538,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""Suppose it done,--who is it could complain?"
6539,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"How could the poor? for they such trifles share,"
6540,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"As add no comfort, as suppress no care;"
6541,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But many a pittance makes a worthy heap, -"
6542,THE PARISH-CLERK.,What says the law? that silence puts to sleep:  -
6543,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Nought then forbids, the danger could we shun,"
6544,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And sure the business may be safely done.
6545,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""But am I earnest?--earnest?  No.--I say,"
6546,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"If such my mind, that I could plan a way;"
6547,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Let me reflect;--I've not allow'd me time
6548,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"To purse the pieces, and if dropp'd they'd chime:"""
6549,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Fertile is evil in the soul of man. -
6550,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He paused,--said Jachin, ""They may drop on bran."
6551,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Why then 'tis safe and (all consider'd) just,"
6552,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The poor receive it,--'tis no breach of trust:"
6553,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The old and widows may their trifles miss,"
6554,THE PARISH-CLERK.,There must be evil in a good like this:
6555,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But I'll be kind--the sick I'll visit twice,"
6556,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"When now but once, and freely give advice."
6557,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Yet let me think again:""--Again he tried,"
6558,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"For stronger reasons on his passion's side,"
6559,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And quickly these were found, yet slowly he complied."
6560,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The morning came:  the common service done,"
6561,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Shut every door,--the solemn rite begun, -"
6562,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And, as the priest the sacred sayings read,"
6563,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The clerk went forward, trembling as he tread:"
6564,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"O'er the tall pew he held the box, and heard"
6565,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The offer'd piece, rejoicing as he fear'd:"
6566,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Just by the pillar, as he cautious tripp'd,"
6567,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And turn'd the aisle, he then a portion slipp'd"
6568,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"From the full store, and to the pocket sent,"
6569,THE PARISH-CLERK.,But held a moment--and then down it went.
6570,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The priest read on, on walk'd the man afraid,"
6571,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Till a gold offering in the plate was laid:
6572,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Trembling he took it, for a moment stopp'd,"
6573,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Then down it fell, and sounded as it dropp'd;"
6574,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Amazed he started, for th' affrighted man,"
6575,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Lost and bewilder'd, thought not of the bran."
6576,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But all were silent, all on things intent"
6577,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Of high concern, none ear to money lent;"
6578,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"So on he walk'd, more cautious than before,"
6579,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And gain'd the purposed sum and one piece more.
6580,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""Practice makes perfect:"" when the month came round,"
6581,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He dropp'd the cash, nor listen'd for a sound:"
6582,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But yet, when last of all th' assembled flock"
6583,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He ate and drank,--it gave th' electric shock:"
6584,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Oft was he forced his reasons to repeat,"
6585,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Ere he could kneel in quiet at his seat;
6586,THE PARISH-CLERK.,But custom soothed him--ere a single year
6587,THE PARISH-CLERK.,All this was done without restraint or fear:
6588,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Cool and collected, easy and composed,"
6589,THE PARISH-CLERK.,He was correct till all the service closed;
6590,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Then to his home, without a groan or sigh,"
6591,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Gravely he went, and laid his treasure by."
6592,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Want will complain:  some widows had express'd
6593,THE PARISH-CLERK.,A doubt if they were favour'd like the rest;
6594,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The rest described with like regret their dole,"
6595,THE PARISH-CLERK.,And thus from parts they reason'd to the whole:
6596,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"When all agreed some evil must be done,"
6597,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Or rich men's hearts grew harder than a stone.
6598,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Our easy vicar cut the matter short;
6599,THE PARISH-CLERK.,He would not listen to such vile report.
6600,THE PARISH-CLERK.,All were not thus--there govern'd in that year
6601,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"A stern stout churl, an angry overseer;"
6602,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"A tyrant fond of power, loud, lewd, and most severe:"
6603,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Him the mild vicar, him the graver clerk,"
6604,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Advised, reproved, but nothing would he mark."
6605,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Save the disgrace; ""and that, my friends,"" said he,"

6615,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"All doubt was over: --when the flock were bless'd,"
6616,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"In wrath he rose, and thus his mind express'd:  -"
6617,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""Foul deeds are here!"" and saying this, he took"
6618,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The Clerk, whose conscience, in her cold-fit, shook:"
6619,THE PARISH-CLERK.,His pocket then was emptied on the place;
6620,THE PARISH-CLERK.,All saw his guilt; all witness'd his disgrace:
6621,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He fell, he fainted, not a groan, a look,"

6635,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He saw another in his office reign,"

6646,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Stretch'd on some wreck, he wore his life away;"

6650,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And when unable to forsake the town,"
6651,THE PARISH-CLERK.,In the blind courts he sat desponding down -
6652,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Always alone:  then feebly would he crawl
6653,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"The church-way walk, and lean upon the wall:"
6654,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"Too ill for this, he lay beside the door,"
6655,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Compell'd to hear the reasoning of the poor:
6656,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He look'd so pale, so weak, the pitying crowd"
6657,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Their firm belief of his repentance vow'd;
6658,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"They saw him then so ghastly and so thin,"
6659,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"That they exclaim'd, ""Is this the work of sin?"""
6660,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"""Yes,"" in his better moments, he replied,"

6664,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"To be man's guide and glory I design'd,"
6665,THE PARISH-CLERK.,A rare example for our sinful kind;
6666,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"But now my weakness and my guilt I see,"
6667,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And am a warning--man, be warn'd by me!"""
6668,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"He said, and saw no more the human face;"

6670,THE PARISH-CLERK.,"And, as the vicar of his state inquired,"
6671,THE PARISH-CLERK.,Turn'd to the wall and silently expired!

6809,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Let there be brazen locks and bars of steel,"

6815,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Still means of freedom will some power devise,"

6817,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"To Northern Wales, in some sequester'd spot,"

6836,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Till some strange means afford a sudden view
6837,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Of some vile plot, and every woe adieu!"

6843,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And life to come, we fairly may suppose,"
6844,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"One light, bright contrast to these wild dark woes."
6845,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"These let us leave, and at her sorrows look,"
6846,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Too often seen, but seldom in a book;"
6847,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Let her who felt, relate them;--on her chair"
6848,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"The heroine sits--in former years, the fair,"
6849,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Now aged and poor; but Ellen Orford knows
6850,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},That we should humbly take what Heaven bestows.
6851,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""My father died--again my mother wed,"
6852,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And found the comforts of her life were fled;

6855,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Their children many, and 'twas my poor place"
6856,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},To nurse and wait on all the infant-race;
6857,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Labour and hunger were indeed my part,"
6858,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And should have strengthen'd an erroneous heart.

6862,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"I soon could bear, but not my mother's sighs;"
6863,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"For she look'd back on comforts, and would say,"
6864,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"'I wrong'd thee, Ellen,' and then turn away:"
6865,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Thus, for my age's good, my youth was tried,"
6866,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And this my fortune till my mother died.
6867,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""So, amid sorrow much and little cheer -"
6868,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},A common case--I pass'd my twentieth year;
6869,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},For these are frequent evils; thousands share
6870,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},An equal grief--the like domestic care.
6871,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Then in my days of bloom, of health, and youth,"
6872,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"One, much above me, vow'd his love and truth:"
6873,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"We often met, he dreading to be seen,"
6874,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And much I question'd what such dread might mean;
6875,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Yet I believed him true; my simple heart
6876,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And undirected reason took his part.
6877,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Can he who loves me, whom I love, deceive?"
6878,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Can I such wrong of one so kind believe,"

6880,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""He dared not marry, but we met to prove"
6881,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},What sad encroachments and deceits has love:
6882,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Weak that I was, when he, rebuked, withdrew,"
6883,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},I let him see that I was wretched too;
6884,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"When less my caution, I had still the pain"
6885,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Of his or mine own weakness to complain.
6886,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Happy the lovers class'd alike in life,"
6887,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Or happier yet the rich endowing wife;
6888,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},But most aggrieved the fond believing maid.
6889,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Of her rich lover tenderly afraid:
6890,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"You judge th' event; for grievous was my fate,"
6891,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Painful to feel, and shameful to relate:"
6892,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Ah! sad it was my burthen to sustain,"
6893,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},When the least misery was the dread of pain;
6894,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"When I have grieving told him my disgrace,"
6895,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And plainly mark'd indifference in his face.
6896,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Hard! with these fears and terrors to behold"
6897,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"The cause of all, the faithless lover, cold;"
6898,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Impatient grown at every wish denied,"
6899,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And barely civil, soothed and gratified;"
6900,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Peevish when urged to think of vows so strong,"
6901,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And angry when I spake of crime and wrong.
6902,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"All this I felt, and still the sorrow grew,"
6903,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Because I felt that I deserved it too,"
6904,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And begg'd my infant stranger to forgive
6905,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"The mother's shame, which in herself must live."
6906,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"When known that shame, I, soon expell'd from home,"
6907,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},With a frail sister shared a hovel's gloom;
6908,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},There barely fed--(what could I more request?)
6909,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"My infant slumberer sleeping at my breast,"
6910,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"I from my window saw his blooming bride,"
6911,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And my seducer smiling at her side;
6912,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Hope lived till then; I sank upon the floor,"
6913,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And grief and thought and feeling were no more:
6914,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Although revived, I judged that life would close,"
6915,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And went to rest, to wonder that I rose:"
6916,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"My dreams were dismal,--wheresoe'er I stray'd,"
6917,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"I seem'd ashamed, alarm'd, despised, betray'd;"
6918,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Always in grief, in guilt, disgraced, forlorn,"
6919,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Mourning that one so weak, so vile, was born;"
6920,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"The earth a desert, tumult in the sea,"
6921,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"The birds affrighten'd fled from tree to tree,"
6922,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Obscured the setting sun, and every thing like me."
6923,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"But Heav'n had mercy, and my need at length"
6924,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Urged me to labour, and renew'd my strength."
6925,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"I strove for patience as a sinner must,"
6926,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Yet felt th' opinion of the world unjust:
6927,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"There was my lover, in his joy esteem'd,"
6928,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And I, in my distress, as guilty deemed;"
6929,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Yet sure, not all the guilt and shame belong"
6930,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},To her who feels and suffers for the wrong:
6931,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"The cheat at play may use the wealth he's won,"
6932,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},But is not honour'd for the mischief done;
6933,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"The cheat in love may use each villain art,"
6934,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And boast the deed that breaks the victim's heart.
6935,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Four years were past; I might again have found"
6936,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Some erring wish, but for another wound:"
6937,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Lovely my daughter grew, her face was fair,"
6938,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},But no expression ever brighten'd there;
6939,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"I doubted long, and vainly strove to make"
6940,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Some certain meaning of the words she spake;
6941,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"But meaning there was none, and I survey'd"
6942,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},With dread the beauties of my idiot-maid.
6943,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Still I submitted;--Oh! 'tis meet and fit
6944,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},In all we feel to make the heart submit;
6945,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Gloomy and calm my days, but I had then,"
6946,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"It seem'd, attractions for the eyes of men:"
6947,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},The sober master of a decent trade
6948,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"O'erlook'd my errors, and his offer made;"
6949,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Reason assented: --true, my heart denied,"
6950,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"'But thou,' I said,'shalt be no more my guide.'"
6951,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""When wed, our toil and trouble, pains and care,"
6952,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Of means to live procured us humble share;
6953,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Five were our sons,--and we, though careful, found"
6954,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Our hopes declining as the year came round:
6955,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"For I perceived, yet would not soon perceive,"
6956,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},My husband stealing from my view to grieve:
6957,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Silent he grew, and when he spoke he sigh'd,"
6958,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And surly look'd, and peevishly replied:"
6959,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Pensive by nature, he had gone of late"
6960,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"To those who preach'd of destiny and fate,"
6961,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Of things foredoom'd, and of election-grace,"
6962,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And how in vain we strive to run our race;
6963,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},That all by works and moral worth we gain
6964,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Is to perceive our care and labour vain;
6965,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"That still the more we pay, our debts the more remain;"
6966,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"That he who feels not the mysterious call,"
6967,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Lies bound in sin, still grov'ling from the fall."
6968,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"My husband felt not: --our persuasion, prayer,"
6969,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And our best reason, darken'd his despair;"
6970,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},His very nature changed; he now reviled
6971,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"My former conduct,--he reproach'd my child:"
6972,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"He talked of bastard slips, and cursed his bed,"
6973,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And from our kindness to concealment fled;
6974,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"For ever to some evil change inclined,"
6975,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"To every gloomy thought he lent his mind,"
6976,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Nor rest would give to us, nor rest himself could find;"
6977,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"His son suspended saw him, long bereft"
6978,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Of life, nor prospect of revival left."
6979,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""With him died all our prospects, and once more"
6980,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},I shared th' allotments of the parish poor;
6981,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"They took my children too, and this I know"
6982,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Was just and lawful, but I felt the blow:"
6983,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},My idiot-maid and one unhealthy boy
6984,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Were left, a mother's misery and her joy."
6985,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Three sons I follow'd to the grave, and one -"
6986,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Oh! can I speak of that unhappy son?
6987,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Would all the memory of that time were fled,"
6988,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And all those horrors, with my child, were dead!"
6989,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Before the world seduced him, what a grace"
6990,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And smile of gladness shone upon his face!
6991,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Then, he had knowledge; finely would he write;"
6992,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Study to him was pleasure and delight;
6993,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Great was his courage, and but few could stand"
6994,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Against the sleight and vigour of his hand;
6995,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"The maidens loved him;--when he came to die,"
6996,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"No, not the coldest could suppress a sigh:"
6997,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Here I must cease--how can I say, my child"
6998,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Was by the bad of either sex beguiled?
6999,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Worst of the bad--they taught him that the laws
7000,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Made wrong and right; there was no other cause,"
7001,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"That all religion was the trade of priests,"
7002,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And men, when dead, must perish like the beasts:  -"
7003,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And he, so lively and so gay, before -"
7004,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Ah; spare a mother--I can tell no more.
7005,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Int'rest was made that they should not destroy"
7006,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},The comely form of my deluded boy -
7007,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},But pardon came not; damp the place and deep
7008,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Where he was kept, as they'd a tiger keep;"
7009,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"For he, unhappy! had before them all"
7010,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Vow'd he'd escape, whatever might befall."
7011,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"He'd means of dress, and dress'd beyond his means,"
7012,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And so to see him in such dismal scenes,"
7013,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},I cannot speak it--cannot bear to tell
7014,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Of that sad hour--I heard the passing bell!
7015,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Slowly they went; he smiled, and look'd so smart,"
7016,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Yet sure he shudder'd when he saw the cart,"
7017,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And gave a look--until my dying day,"
7018,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},That look will never from my mind away:
7019,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Oft as I sit, and ever in my dreams,"
7020,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"I see that look, and they have heard my screams."
7021,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Now let me speak no more--yet all declared"
7022,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"That one so young, in pity, should be spared."
7023,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And one so manly;--on his graceful neck,"
7024,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"That chains of jewels may be proud to deck,"
7025,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},To a small mole a mother's lips have press'd -
7026,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And there the cord--my breath is sore oppress'd.
7027,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""I now can speak again: --my elder boy"
7028,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Was that year drown'd,--a seaman in a hoy:"
7029,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},He left a numerous race; of these would some
7030,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"In their young troubles to my cottage come,"
7031,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And these I taught--an humble teacher I -
7032,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Upon their heavenly Parent to rely.
7033,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Alas! I needed such reliance more:"
7034,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"My idiot-girl, so simply gay before,"
7035,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Now wept in pain:  some wretch had found a time,"
7036,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Depraved and wicked, for that coward crime;"
7037,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"I had indeed my doubt, but I suppress'd"
7038,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},The thought that day and night disturb'd my rest;
7039,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},She and that sick-pale brother--but why strive
7040,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},To keep the terrors of that time alive?
7041,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""The hour arrived, the new, th' undreaded pain,"
7042,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"That came with violence, and yet came in vain."
7043,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},I saw her die:  her brother too is dead;
7044,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Nor own'd such crime--what is it that I dread?
7045,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""The parish aid withdrawn, I look'd around,"
7046,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},And in my school a bless'd subsistence found -
7047,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},My winter-calm of life:  to be of use
7048,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},Would pleasant thoughts and heavenly hopes produce;
7049,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},I loved them all; it soothed me to presage
7050,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"The various trials of their riper age,"
7051,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Then dwell on mine, and bless the Power who gave"
7052,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Pains to correct us, and remorse to save."
7053,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"""Yes! these were days of peace, but they are past, -"
7054,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"A trial came, I will believe, a last;"
7055,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"I lost my sight, and my employment gone,"
7056,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Useless I live, but to the day live on;"
7057,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Those eyes which long the light of heaven enjoy'd,"
7058,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"Were not by pain, by agony destroy'd:"
7059,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"My senses fail not all; I speak, I pray;"
7060,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"By night my rest, my food I take by day;"
7061,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"And, as my mind looks cheerful to my end,"
7062,ELLEN ORFORD. {11},"I love mankind, and call my GOD my friend."""

7089,ABEL KEENE.,
7090,ABEL KEENE.,
7091,ABEL KEENE.,"A QUIET, simple man was Abel Keene,"
7092,ABEL KEENE.,"He meant no harm, nor did he often mean;"
7093,ABEL KEENE.,"He kept a school of loud rebellious boys,"
7094,ABEL KEENE.,"And growing old, grew nervous with the noise;"
7095,ABEL KEENE.,"When a kind merchant hired his useful pen,"
7096,ABEL KEENE.,And made him happiest of accompting men;
7097,ABEL KEENE.,"With glee he rose to every easy day,"
7098,ABEL KEENE.,When half the labour brought him twice the pay.
7099,ABEL KEENE.,"There were young clerks, and there the merchant's son,"
7100,ABEL KEENE.,"Choice spirits all, who wish'd him to be one;"
7101,ABEL KEENE.,"It must, no question, give them lively joy,"
7102,ABEL KEENE.,Hopes long indulged to combat and destroy;
7103,ABEL KEENE.,"At these they levelled all their skill and strength, -"
7104,ABEL KEENE.,"He fell not quickly, but he fell at length:"
7105,ABEL KEENE.,"They quoted books, to him both bold and new,"
7106,ABEL KEENE.,And scorn'd as fables all he held as true;
7107,ABEL KEENE.,"""Such monkish stories, and such nursery lies,"""
7108,ABEL KEENE.,That he was struck with terror and surprise.
7109,ABEL KEENE.,"""What! all his life had he the laws obey'd,"
7110,ABEL KEENE.,Which they broke through and were not once afraid?
7111,ABEL KEENE.,"Had he so long his evil passions check'd,"
7112,ABEL KEENE.,And yet at last had nothing to expect?
7113,ABEL KEENE.,"While they their lives in joy and pleasure led,"
7114,ABEL KEENE.,And then had nothing at the end to dread?
7115,ABEL KEENE.,Was all his priest with so much zeal convey'd
7116,ABEL KEENE.,A part! a speech! for which the man was paid!
7117,ABEL KEENE.,"And were his pious books, his solemn prayers,"
7118,ABEL KEENE.,Not worth one tale of the admir'd Voltaire's?
7119,ABEL KEENE.,"Then was it time, while yet some years remain'd,"
7120,ABEL KEENE.,"To drink untroubled and to think unchain'd,"
7121,ABEL KEENE.,"And on all pleasues, which his purse could give,"
7122,ABEL KEENE.,"Freely to seize, and while he lived, to live."""
7123,ABEL KEENE.,"Much time he pass'd in this important strife,"
7124,ABEL KEENE.,The bliss or bane of his remaining life;
7125,ABEL KEENE.,"For converts all are made with care and grief,"
7126,ABEL KEENE.,And pangs attend the birth of unbelief;
7127,ABEL KEENE.,Nor pass they soon;--with awe and fear he took
7128,ABEL KEENE.,"The flowery way, and cast back many a look."
7129,ABEL KEENE.,"The youths applauded much his wise design,"
7130,ABEL KEENE.,With weighty reasoning o'er their evening wine;
7131,ABEL KEENE.,"And much in private 'twould their mirth improve,"
7132,ABEL KEENE.,To hear how Abel spake of life and love;
7133,ABEL KEENE.,"To hear him own what grievous pains it cost,"
7134,ABEL KEENE.,"Ere the old saint was in the sinner lost,"
7135,ABEL KEENE.,"Ere his poor mind, with every deed alarm'd,"
7136,ABEL KEENE.,"By wit was settled, and by vice was charm'd."
7137,ABEL KEENE.,"For Abel enter'd in his bold career,"
7138,ABEL KEENE.,"Like boys on ice, with pleasure and with fear;"
7139,ABEL KEENE.,"Lingering, yet longing for the joy, he went,"
7140,ABEL KEENE.,"Repenting now, now dreading to repent:"
7141,ABEL KEENE.,"With awkward pace, and with himself at war,"
7142,ABEL KEENE.,"Far gone, yet frighten'd that he went so far;"
7143,ABEL KEENE.,"Oft for his efforts he'd solicit praise,"
7144,ABEL KEENE.,And then proceed with blunders and delays:
7145,ABEL KEENE.,"The young more aptly passions' calls pursue,"
7146,ABEL KEENE.,"But age and weakness start at scenes so new,"
7147,ABEL KEENE.,"And tremble, when they've done, for all they dared to do."
7148,ABEL KEENE.,"At length example Abel's dread removed,"
7149,ABEL KEENE.,With small concern he sought the joys he loved;
7150,ABEL KEENE.,"Not resting here, he claim'd his share of fame,"
7151,ABEL KEENE.,"And first their votary, then their wit became;"
7152,ABEL KEENE.,"His jest was bitter and his satire bold,"
7153,ABEL KEENE.,When he his tales of formal brethren told;
7154,ABEL KEENE.,"What time with pious neighbours he discuss'd,"
7155,ABEL KEENE.,Their boasted treasure and their boundless trust:
7156,ABEL KEENE.,"""Such were our dreams,"" the jovial elder cried;"
7157,ABEL KEENE.,"""Awake and live,"" his youthful friends replied."
7158,ABEL KEENE.,"Now the gay clerk a modest drab despised,"
7159,ABEL KEENE.,"And clad him smartly, as his friends advised;"
7160,ABEL KEENE.,"So fine a coat upon his back he threw,"
7161,ABEL KEENE.,That not an alley-boy old Abel knew;
7162,ABEL KEENE.,"Broad polish'd buttons blazed that coat upon,"
7163,ABEL KEENE.,"And just beneath the watch's trinkets shone, -"
7164,ABEL KEENE.,"A splendid watch, that pointed out the time,"
7165,ABEL KEENE.,To fly from business and make free with crime:
7166,ABEL KEENE.,The crimson waistcoat and the silken hose
7167,ABEL KEENE.,Rank'd the lean man among the Borough beaux:
7168,ABEL KEENE.,"His raven hair he cropp'd with fierce disdain,"
7169,ABEL KEENE.,And light elastic locks encased his brain:
7170,ABEL KEENE.,"More pliant pupil who could hope to find,"
7171,ABEL KEENE.,Se deck'd in person and so changed in mind?
7172,ABEL KEENE.,"When Abel walked the streets, with pleasent mien"
7173,ABEL KEENE.,"He met his friends, delighted to be seen;"
7174,ABEL KEENE.,"And when he rode along the public way,"
7175,ABEL KEENE.,"No beau so gaudy, and no youth so gay."
7176,ABEL KEENE.,"His pious sister, now an ancient maid,"
7177,ABEL KEENE.,"For Abel fearing, first in secret pray'd;"
7178,ABEL KEENE.,Then thus in love and scorn her notions she convey'd.
7179,ABEL KEENE.,"""Alas! my brother! can I see thee pace"
7180,ABEL KEENE.,"Hoodwink'd to hell, and not lament thy case,"
7181,ABEL KEENE.,Nor stretch my feeble hand to stop thy headlong race?
7182,ABEL KEENE.,Lo! thou art bound; a slave in Satan's chain;
7183,ABEL KEENE.,The righteous Abel turn'd the wretched Cain;
7184,ABEL KEENE.,"His brother's blood against the murderer cried,"
7185,ABEL KEENE.,"Against thee thine, unhappy suicide!"
7186,ABEL KEENE.,"Are all our pious nights and peaceful days,"
7187,ABEL KEENE.,"Our evening readings and our morning praise,"
7188,ABEL KEENE.,"Our spirits' comfort in the trials sent,"
7189,ABEL KEENE.,"Our hearts' rejoicings in the blessings lent,"
7190,ABEL KEENE.,"All that o'er grief a cheering influence shed,"
7191,ABEL KEENE.,Are these for ever and for ever fled?
7192,ABEL KEENE.,"""When in the years gone by, the trying years,"
7193,ABEL KEENE.,"When faith and hope had strife with wants and fears,"
7194,ABEL KEENE.,Thy nerves have trembled till thou couldst not eat
7195,ABEL KEENE.,(Dress'd by this hand) thy mess of simple meat;
7196,ABEL KEENE.,"When, grieved by fastings, gall'd by fates severe,"
7197,ABEL KEENE.,Slow pass'd the days of the successless year;
7198,ABEL KEENE.,"Still in these gloomy hours, my brother then"
7199,ABEL KEENE.,"Had glorious views, unseen by prosperous men:"
7200,ABEL KEENE.,"And when thy heart has felt its wish denied,"
7201,ABEL KEENE.,What gracious texts hast thou to grief applied;
7202,ABEL KEENE.,"Till thou hast enter'd in thine humble bed,"
7203,ABEL KEENE.,By lofty hopes and heavenly musings fed;
7204,ABEL KEENE.,Then I have seen thy lively looks express
7205,ABEL KEENE.,The spirit's comforts in the man's distress.
7206,ABEL KEENE.,"""Then didst thou cry, exulting, 'Yes, 'tis fit,"
7207,ABEL KEENE.,"'Tis meet and right, my heart! that we submit:'"
7208,ABEL KEENE.,"And wilt thou, Abel, thy new pleasures weigh"
7209,ABEL KEENE.,Against such triumphs?--Oh? repent and pray.
7210,ABEL KEENE.,"""What are thy pleasures?--with the gay to sit,"
7211,ABEL KEENE.,And thy poor brain torment for awkward wit;
7212,ABEL KEENE.,"All thy good thoughts (thou hat'st them) to restrain,"
7213,ABEL KEENE.,And give a wicked pleasure to the vain;
7214,ABEL KEENE.,"Thy long, lean frame by fashion to attire,"
7215,ABEL KEENE.,That lads may laugh and wantons may admire;
7216,ABEL KEENE.,"To raise the mirth of boys, and not to see,"
7217,ABEL KEENE.,Unhappy maniac! that they laugh at thee
7218,ABEL KEENE.,"""These boyish follies, which alone the boy"
7219,ABEL KEENE.,"Can idly act, or gracefully enjoy,"
7220,ABEL KEENE.,"Add new reproaches to thy fallen state,"
7221,ABEL KEENE.,And make men scorn what they would only hate.
7222,ABEL KEENE.,"""What pains, my brother, dost thou take to prove"
7223,ABEL KEENE.,A taste for follies which thou canst not love!
7224,ABEL KEENE.,Why do thy stiffening limbs the steed bestride -
7225,ABEL KEENE.,That lads may laugh to see thou canst not ride?
7226,ABEL KEENE.,And why (I feel the crimson tinge my cheek)
7227,ABEL KEENE.,Dost thou by night in Diamond-Alley sneak?
7228,ABEL KEENE.,"""Farewell! the parish will thy sister keep,"
7229,ABEL KEENE.,"Where she in peace shall pray and sing and sleep,"
7230,ABEL KEENE.,"Save when for thee she mourns, thou wicked, wandering sheep."
7231,ABEL KEENE.,"When youth is fallen, there's hope the young may rise,"
7232,ABEL KEENE.,But fallen age for ever hopeless lies;
7233,ABEL KEENE.,"Torn up by storms, and placed in earth once more,"
7234,ABEL KEENE.,The younger tree may sun and soil restore;
7235,ABEL KEENE.,"But when the old and sapless trunk lies low,"
7236,ABEL KEENE.,No care or soil can former life bestow;
7237,ABEL KEENE.,Reserved for burning is the worthless tree -
7238,ABEL KEENE.,"And what, O Abel! is reserved for thee?"""
7239,ABEL KEENE.,"These angry words our hero deeply felt,"
7240,ABEL KEENE.,"Though hard his heart, and indisposed to melt!"
7241,ABEL KEENE.,"To gain relief he took a glass the more,"
7242,ABEL KEENE.,And then went on as careless as before;
7243,ABEL KEENE.,"Thenceforth, uncheck'd, amusements he partook,"
7244,ABEL KEENE.,And (save his ledger) saw no decent book;
7245,ABEL KEENE.,"Him found the merchant punctual at his task,"
7246,ABEL KEENE.,"And that performed, he'd nothing more to ask;"
7247,ABEL KEENE.,"He cared not how old Abel play'd the fool,"
7248,ABEL KEENE.,"No master he, beyond the hours of school:"
7249,ABEL KEENE.,"Thus they proceeding, had their wine and joke,"
7250,ABEL KEENE.,"Till merchant Dixon felt a warning stroke,"
7251,ABEL KEENE.,"And, after struggling half a gloomy week,"
7252,ABEL KEENE.,Left his poor clerk another friend to seek.
7253,ABEL KEENE.,"Alas! the son, who led the saint astray,"
7254,ABEL KEENE.,Forgot the man whose follies made him gay;
7255,ABEL KEENE.,"He cared no more for Abel in his need,"
7256,ABEL KEENE.,Than Abel cared about his hackney steed:
7257,ABEL KEENE.,"He now, alas! had all his earnings spent,"
7258,ABEL KEENE.,And thus was left to languish and repent;
7259,ABEL KEENE.,"No school nor clerkship found he in the place,"
7260,ABEL KEENE.,"Now lost to fortune, as before to grace."
7261,ABEL KEENE.,"For town-relief the grieving man applied,"
7262,ABEL KEENE.,And begg'd with tears what some with scorn denied;
7263,ABEL KEENE.,"Others look'd down upon the glowing vest,"
7264,ABEL KEENE.,"And frowning, ask'd him at what price he dress'd?"
7265,ABEL KEENE.,"Happy for him his country's laws are mild,"
7266,ABEL KEENE.,"They must support him, though they still reviled;"
7267,ABEL KEENE.,"Grieved, abject, scorn'd, insulted, and betray'd,"
7268,ABEL KEENE.,"Of God unmindful, and of man afraid, -"
7269,ABEL KEENE.,"No more he talk'd; 'twas pain, 'twas shame to speak,"
7270,ABEL KEENE.,"His heart was sinking, and his frame was weak."
7271,ABEL KEENE.,"His sister died with such serene delight,"
7272,ABEL KEENE.,He once again began to think her right;
7273,ABEL KEENE.,"Poor like himself, the happy spinster lay,"
7274,ABEL KEENE.,And sweet assurance bless'd her dying-day:
7275,ABEL KEENE.,"Poor like the spinster, he, when death was nigh,"
7276,ABEL KEENE.,"Assured of nothing, felt afraid to die."
7277,ABEL KEENE.,"The cheerful clerks who sometimes pass'd the door,"
7278,ABEL KEENE.,"Just mention'd ""Abel!"" and then thought no more."
7279,ABEL KEENE.,"So Abel, pondering on his state forlorn,"
7280,ABEL KEENE.,"Look'd round for comfort, and was chased by scorn."
7281,ABEL KEENE.,"And now we saw him on the beach reclined,"
7282,ABEL KEENE.,Or causeless walking in the wintry wind;
7283,ABEL KEENE.,"And when it raised a loud and angry sea,"
7284,ABEL KEENE.,"He stood and gazed, in wretched reverie:"
7285,ABEL KEENE.,"He heeded not the frost, the rain, the snow,"
7286,ABEL KEENE.,Close by the sea he walk'd alone and slow:
7287,ABEL KEENE.,Sometimes his frame through many an hour he spread
7288,ABEL KEENE.,"Upon a tombstone, moveless as the dead;"
7289,ABEL KEENE.,"And was there found a sad and silent place,"
7290,ABEL KEENE.,There would he creep with slow and measured pace;
7291,ABEL KEENE.,"Then would he wander by the river's side,"
7292,ABEL KEENE.,And fix his eyes upon the falling tide;
7293,ABEL KEENE.,"The deep dry ditch, the rushes in the fen,"
7294,ABEL KEENE.,And mossy crag-pits were his lodgings then:
7295,ABEL KEENE.,"There, to his discontented thought a prey,"
7296,ABEL KEENE.,The melancholy mortal pined away.
7297,ABEL KEENE.,The neighb'ring poor at length began to speak
7298,ABEL KEENE.,Of Abel's ramblings--he'd been gone a week;
7299,ABEL KEENE.,"They knew not where, and little care they took"
7300,ABEL KEENE.,For one so friendless and so poor to look.
7301,ABEL KEENE.,"At last a stranger, in a pedlar's shed,"
7302,ABEL KEENE.,Beheld him hanging--he had long been dead.
7303,ABEL KEENE.,"He left a paper, penn'd at sundry times,"
7304,ABEL KEENE.,"Entitled thus--""My Groanings and my Crimes!"""
7305,ABEL KEENE.,"""I was a Christian man, and none could lay"
7306,ABEL KEENE.,Aught to my charge; I walk'd the narrow way:
7307,ABEL KEENE.,"All then was simple faith, serene and pure,"
7308,ABEL KEENE.,My hope was stedfast and my prospects sure;
7309,ABEL KEENE.,"Then was I tried by want and sickness sore,"
7310,ABEL KEENE.,"But these I clapp'd my shield of faith before,"
7311,ABEL KEENE.,And cares and wants and man's rebukes I bore:
7312,ABEL KEENE.,"Alas! new foes assail'd me; I was vain,"
7313,ABEL KEENE.,They stung my pride and they confused my brain:
7314,ABEL KEENE.,Oh! these deluders! with what glee they saw
7315,ABEL KEENE.,Their simple dupe transgress the righteous law;
7316,ABEL KEENE.,"'Twas joy to them to view that dreadful strife,"
7317,ABEL KEENE.,When faith and frailty warr'd for more than life;
7318,ABEL KEENE.,"So with their pleasures they beguiled the heart,"
7319,ABEL KEENE.,Then with their logic they allay'd the smart;
7320,ABEL KEENE.,"They proved (so thought I then) with reasons strong,"
7321,ABEL KEENE.,That no man's feelings ever lead him wrong:
7322,ABEL KEENE.,"And thus I went, as on the varnish'd ice,"
7323,ABEL KEENE.,The smooth career of unbelief and vice.
7324,ABEL KEENE.,"Oft would the youths, with sprightly speech and bold,"
7325,ABEL KEENE.,Their witty tales of naughty priests unfold;
7326,ABEL KEENE.,"'Twas all a craft,' they said, 'a cunning trade;"
7327,ABEL KEENE.,"Not she the priests, but priests Religion made.'"
7328,ABEL KEENE.,"So I believed:""--No, Abel! to thy grief:"
7329,ABEL KEENE.,So thou relinquish'dst all that was belief:  -
7330,ABEL KEENE.,"""I grew as very flint, and when the rest"
7331,ABEL KEENE.,"Laugh'd at devotion, I enjoy'd the jest;"
7332,ABEL KEENE.,"But this all vanish'd like the morning-dew,"
7333,ABEL KEENE.,"When unemploy'd, and poor again I grew;"
7334,ABEL KEENE.,"Yea! I was doubly poor, for I was wicked too."
7335,ABEL KEENE.,"""The mouse that trespass'd and the treasure stole,"
7336,ABEL KEENE.,Found his lean body fitted to the hole;
7337,ABEL KEENE.,"Till, having fatted, he was forced to stay,"
7338,ABEL KEENE.,"And, fasting, starve his stolen bulk away:"
7339,ABEL KEENE.,"Ah ! worse for me--grown poor, I yet remain"
7340,ABEL KEENE.,"In sinful bonds, and pray and fast in vain."
7341,ABEL KEENE.,"""At length I thought, although these friends of sin"
7342,ABEL KEENE.,"Have spread their net, and caught their prey therein;"
7343,ABEL KEENE.,"Though my hard heart could not for mercy call,"
7344,ABEL KEENE.,"Because though great my grief, my faith was small;"
7345,ABEL KEENE.,"Yet, as the sick on skilful men rely,"
7346,ABEL KEENE.,The soul diseased may to a doctor fly.
7347,ABEL KEENE.,"""A famous one there was, whose skill had wrought"
7348,ABEL KEENE.,"Cures past belief, and him the sinners sought;"
7349,ABEL KEENE.,"Numbers there were defiled by mire and filth,"
7350,ABEL KEENE.,Whom he recovered by his goodly tilth:
7351,ABEL KEENE.,"'Come then,' I said, 'let me the man behold,"
7352,ABEL KEENE.,And tell my case:'--I saw him and I told.
7353,ABEL KEENE.,"""With trembling voice, 'Oh! reverend sir,' I said,"
7354,ABEL KEENE.,"'I once believed, and I was then misled;"
7355,ABEL KEENE.,"And now such doubts my sinful soul beset,"
7356,ABEL KEENE.,I dare not say that I'm a Christian yet;
7357,ABEL KEENE.,"Canst thou, good sir, by thy superior skill,"
7358,ABEL KEENE.,Inform my judgment and direct my will?
7359,ABEL KEENE.,"Ah! give thy cordial; let my soul have rest,"
7360,ABEL KEENE.,And be the outward man alone distress'd;
7361,ABEL KEENE.,"For at my state I tremble.'--'Tremble more,'"
7362,ABEL KEENE.,"Said the good man, 'and then rejoice therefore!"
7363,ABEL KEENE.,"'Tis good to tremble; prospects then are fair,"
7364,ABEL KEENE.,When the lost soul is plunged in deep despair:
7365,ABEL KEENE.,"Once thou wert simply honest, just, and pure,"
7366,ABEL KEENE.,"Whole, as thou thought'st, and never wish'd a cure:"
7367,ABEL KEENE.,"Now thou hast plunged in folly, shame, disgrace,"
7368,ABEL KEENE.,Now thou'rt an object meet for healing grace;
7369,ABEL KEENE.,"No merit thine, no virtue, hope, belief,"
7370,ABEL KEENE.,"Nothing hast thou, but misery, sin, and grief;"
7371,ABEL KEENE.,"The best, the only titles to relief.'"
7372,ABEL KEENE.,"'What must I do,' I said, 'my soul to free?' -"
7373,ABEL KEENE.,"'Do nothing, man; it will be done for thee.'"
7374,ABEL KEENE.,"'But must I not, my reverend guide, believe?' -"
7375,ABEL KEENE.,"'If thou art call'd, thou wilt the faith receive.'"
7376,ABEL KEENE.,"'But I repent not.'--Angry he replied,"
7377,ABEL KEENE.,"'If thou art call'd, though needest nought beside:"
7378,ABEL KEENE.,"Attend on us, and if 'tis Heaven's decree,"
7379,ABEL KEENE.,"The call will come,--if not, ah! woe for thee.'"
7380,ABEL KEENE.,"""There then I waited, ever on the watch,"
7381,ABEL KEENE.,"A spark of hope, a ray of light to catch;"
7382,ABEL KEENE.,"His words fell softly like the flakes of snow,"
7383,ABEL KEENE.,But I could never find my heart o'erflow:
7384,ABEL KEENE.,"He cried aloud, till in the flock began"
7385,ABEL KEENE.,"The sigh, the tear, as caught from man to man;"
7386,ABEL KEENE.,"They wept and they rejoiced, and there was I"
7387,ABEL KEENE.,"Hard as a flint, and as the desert dry:"
7388,ABEL KEENE.,"To me no tokens of the call would come,"
7389,ABEL KEENE.,"I felt my sentence, and received my doom;"
7390,ABEL KEENE.,"But I complain'd--'Let thy repinings cease,"
7391,ABEL KEENE.,"Oh! man of sin, for they thy guilt increase;"
7392,ABEL KEENE.,It bloweth where it listeth;--die in peace.'
7393,ABEL KEENE.,"- In peace, and perish?' I replied; 'impart"
7394,ABEL KEENE.,Some better comfort to a burthen'd heart.'
7395,ABEL KEENE.,"'Alas!' the priest return'd, 'can I direct"
7396,ABEL KEENE.,The heavenly call?--Do I proclaim th' elect?
7397,ABEL KEENE.,"Raise not thy voice against th' Eternal will,"
7398,ABEL KEENE.,"But take thy part with sinners, and be still.'"
7399,ABEL KEENE.,"""Alas, for me! no more the times of peace"
7400,ABEL KEENE.,Are mine on earth--in death my pains may cease.
7401,ABEL KEENE.,"""Foes to my soul! ye young seducers, know"
7402,ABEL KEENE.,What serious ills from your amusements flow;
7403,ABEL KEENE.,"Opinions you with so much ease profess,"
7404,ABEL KEENE.,Overwhelm the simple and their minds oppress:
7405,ABEL KEENE.,"Let such be happy, nor with reasons strong,"
7406,ABEL KEENE.,"That make them wretched, prove their notions wrong;"
7407,ABEL KEENE.,"Let them proceed in that they deem the way,"
7408,ABEL KEENE.,"Fast when they will, and at their pleasure pray:"
7409,ABEL KEENE.,"Yes, I have pity for my brethren's lot,"
7410,ABEL KEENE.,"And so had Dives, but it help'd him not:"
7411,ABEL KEENE.,And is it thus?--I'm full of doubts: --Adieu!

7459,PETER GRIMES.,"Yes! then he wept, and to his mind there came"

7461,PETER GRIMES.,"How he had oft the good old man reviled,"
7462,PETER GRIMES.,And never paid the duty of a child;
7463,PETER GRIMES.,"How, when the father in his Bible read,"

7488,PETER GRIMES.,"He knew not justice, and he laugh'd at law;"
7489,PETER GRIMES.,"On all he mark'd, he stretch'd his ready hand;"
7490,PETER GRIMES.,He fish'd by water and he filch'd by land:
7491,PETER GRIMES.,"Oft in the night has Peter dropp'd his oar,"
7492,PETER GRIMES.,"Fled from his boat, and sought for prey on shore;"
7493,PETER GRIMES.,"Oft up the hedge-row glided, on his back"
7494,PETER GRIMES.,"Bearing the orchard's produce in a sack,"
7495,PETER GRIMES.,"Or farm-yard load, tugg'd fiercely from the stack;"
7496,PETER GRIMES.,"And as these wrongs to greater numbers rose,"
7497,PETER GRIMES.,The more he look'd on all men as his foes.
7498,PETER GRIMES.,"He built a mud-wall'd hovel, where he kept"

7502,PETER GRIMES.,He wanted some obedient boy to stand
7503,PETER GRIMES.,And bear the blow of his outrageous hand;
7504,PETER GRIMES.,And hoped to find in some propitious hour
7505,PETER GRIMES.,A feeling creature subject to his power.
7506,PETER GRIMES.,"Peter had heard there were in London then, -"

7514,PETER GRIMES.,Some few in town observed in Peter's trap
7515,PETER GRIMES.,"A boy, with jacket blue and woollen cap;"

7518,PETER GRIMES.,"None could the ridges on his back behold,"
7519,PETER GRIMES.,None sought him shiv'ring in the winter's cold;
7520,PETER GRIMES.,"None put the question,--""Peter, dost thou give"

7522,PETER GRIMES.,"Consider, Peter, let the child have bread,"
7523,PETER GRIMES.,"He'll serve the better if he's stroked and fed."""
7524,PETER GRIMES.,"None reason'd thus--and some, on hearing cries,"
7525,PETER GRIMES.,"Said calmly, ""Grimes is at his exercise."""
7526,PETER GRIMES.,"Pinn'd, beaten, cold, pinch'd, threaten'd, and abused -"
7527,PETER GRIMES.,"His efforts punish'd and his food refused, -"

7529,PETER GRIMES.,"Struck if he wept, and yet compell'd to weep,"
7530,PETER GRIMES.,"The trembling boy dropp'd down and strove to pray,"

7532,PETER GRIMES.,"Or sobb'd and hid his piteous face;--while he,"
7533,PETER GRIMES.,"The savage master, grinn'd in horrid glee:"
7534,PETER GRIMES.,"He'd now the power he ever loved to show,"
7535,PETER GRIMES.,A feeling being subject to his blow.
7536,PETER GRIMES.,"Thus lived the lad, in hunger, peril, pain,"
7537,PETER GRIMES.,"His tears despised, his supplications vain:"
7538,PETER GRIMES.,"Compe'lld by fear to lie, by need to steal,"
7539,PETER GRIMES.,"His bed uneasy and unbless'd his meal,"
7540,PETER GRIMES.,"For three sad years the boy his tortures bore,"
7541,PETER GRIMES.,And then his pains and trials were no more.
7542,PETER GRIMES.,"""How died he, Peter?"" when the people said,"
7543,PETER GRIMES.,"He growl'd--""I found him lifeless in his bed;"""
7544,PETER GRIMES.,"Then tried for softer tone, and sigh'd, ""Poor Sam is dead."""
7545,PETER GRIMES.,"Yet murmurs were there, and some questions ask'd -"
7546,PETER GRIMES.,"How he was fed, how punish'd, and how task'd?"
7547,PETER GRIMES.,"Much they suspected, but they little proved,"
7548,PETER GRIMES.,And Peter pass'd untroubled and unmoved.
7549,PETER GRIMES.,"Another boy with equal ease was found,"
7550,PETER GRIMES.,"The money granted, and the victim bound;"
7551,PETER GRIMES.,And what his fate?--One night it chanced he fell
7552,PETER GRIMES.,"From the boat's mast and perish'd in her well,"
7553,PETER GRIMES.,"Where fish were living kept, and where the boy"
7554,PETER GRIMES.,(So reason'd men) could not himself destroy:  -
7555,PETER GRIMES.,"""Yes! so it was"" said Peter, ""in his play,"
7556,PETER GRIMES.,"(For he was idle both by night and day,)"
7557,PETER GRIMES.,"He climb'd the main-mast and then fell below;"" -"
7558,PETER GRIMES.,"Then show'd his corpse, and pointed to the blow."
7559,PETER GRIMES.,"""What said the jury?""--they were long in doubt,"
7560,PETER GRIMES.,But sturdy Peter faced the matter out:
7561,PETER GRIMES.,"So they dismissed him, saying at the time,"
7562,PETER GRIMES.,"""Keep fast your hatchway when you've boys who climb."""
7563,PETER GRIMES.,"This hit the conscience, and he colour'd more"
7564,PETER GRIMES.,Than for the closest questions put before.
7565,PETER GRIMES.,"Thus all his fears the verdict set aside,"
7566,PETER GRIMES.,And at the slave-shop Peter still applied.
7567,PETER GRIMES.,"Then came a boy, of manners soft and mild, -"
7568,PETER GRIMES.,Our seamen's wives with grief beheld the child;
7569,PETER GRIMES.,All thought (the poor themselves) that he was one
7570,PETER GRIMES.,"Of gentle blood, some noble sinner's son,"
7571,PETER GRIMES.,"Who had, belike, deceived some humble maid,"
7572,PETER GRIMES.,Whom he had first seduced and then betray'd:  -
7573,PETER GRIMES.,"However this, he seem'd a gracious lad,"
7574,PETER GRIMES.,"In grief submissive, and with patience sad."
7575,PETER GRIMES.,"Passive he labour'd, till his slender frame"
7576,PETER GRIMES.,"Bent with his loads, and he at length was lame:"
7577,PETER GRIMES.,Strange that a frame so weak could bear so long
7578,PETER GRIMES.,The grossest insult and the foulest wrong;
7579,PETER GRIMES.,But there were causes--in the town they gave
7580,PETER GRIMES.,"Fire, food, and comfort, to the gentle slave;"
7581,PETER GRIMES.,"And though stern Peter, with a cruel hand,"
7582,PETER GRIMES.,"And knotted rope, enforced the rude command,"
7583,PETER GRIMES.,"Yet he consider'd what he'd lately felt,"
7584,PETER GRIMES.,And his vile blows with selfish pity dealt.
7585,PETER GRIMES.,"One day such draughts the cruel fisher made,"
7586,PETER GRIMES.,"He could not vend them in his borough-trade,"
7587,PETER GRIMES.,"But sail'd for London-mart:  the boy was ill,"
7588,PETER GRIMES.,But ever humbled to his master's will;
7589,PETER GRIMES.,"And on the river, where they smoothly sail'd,"
7590,PETER GRIMES.,He strove with terror and awhile prevail'd;
7591,PETER GRIMES.,"But new to danger on the angry sea,"
7592,PETER GRIMES.,He clung affrighten'd to his master's knee:
7593,PETER GRIMES.,"The boat grew leaky and the wind was strong,"
7594,PETER GRIMES.,Rough was the passage and the time was long;
7595,PETER GRIMES.,"His liquor fail'd, and Peter's wrath arose, -"
7596,PETER GRIMES.,"No more is known--the rest we must suppose,"
7597,PETER GRIMES.,"Or learn of Peter: --Peter says, he ""spied"
7598,PETER GRIMES.,The stripling's danger and for harbour tried;
7599,PETER GRIMES.,"Meantime the fish, and then th' apprentice died."""
7600,PETER GRIMES.,"The pitying women raised a clamour round,"
7601,PETER GRIMES.,"And weeping said, ""Thou hast thy 'prentice drown'd."""
7602,PETER GRIMES.,"Now the stern man was summon'd to the hall,"
7603,PETER GRIMES.,To tell his tale before the burghers all:
7604,PETER GRIMES.,"He gave th' account; profess'd the lad he loved,"
7605,PETER GRIMES.,And kept his brazen features all unmoved.
7606,PETER GRIMES.,"The mayor himself with tone severe replied, -"
7607,PETER GRIMES.,"""Henceforth with thee shall never boy abide;"
7608,PETER GRIMES.,"Hire thee a freeman, whom thou durst not beat,"
7609,PETER GRIMES.,"But who, in thy despite, will sleep and eat:"
7610,PETER GRIMES.,"Free thou art now!--again shouldst thou appear,"
7611,PETER GRIMES.,"Thou'lt find thy sentence, like thy soul, severe."""
7612,PETER GRIMES.,"Alas! for Peter not a helping hand,"
7613,PETER GRIMES.,"So was he hated, could he now command;"
7614,PETER GRIMES.,"Alone he row'd his boat, alone he cast"
7615,PETER GRIMES.,"His nets beside, or made his anchor fast:"
7616,PETER GRIMES.,"To hold a rope or hear a curse was none, -"
7617,PETER GRIMES.,He toil'd and rail'd; he groan'd and swore alone.
7618,PETER GRIMES.,"Thus by himself compell'd to live each day,"
7619,PETER GRIMES.,To wait for certain hours the tide's delay;
7620,PETER GRIMES.,"At the same time the same dull views to see,"
7621,PETER GRIMES.,The bounding marsh-bank and the blighted tree;
7622,PETER GRIMES.,"The water only, when the tides were high,"
7623,PETER GRIMES.,"When low, the mud half cover'd and half-dry;"
7624,PETER GRIMES.,"The sun-burnt tar that blisters on the planks,"
7625,PETER GRIMES.,And bank-side stakes in their uneven ranks;
7626,PETER GRIMES.,"Heaps of entangled weeds that slowly float,"
7627,PETER GRIMES.,As the tide rolls by the impeded boat.
7628,PETER GRIMES.,"When tides were neap, and, in the sultry day,"
7629,PETER GRIMES.,"Through the tall bounding mud-banks made their way,"
7630,PETER GRIMES.,"Which on each side rose swelling, and below"
7631,PETER GRIMES.,The dark warm flood ran silently and slow;
7632,PETER GRIMES.,"There anchoring, Peter chose from man to hide,"
7633,PETER GRIMES.,"There hang his head, and view the lazy tide"
7634,PETER GRIMES.,In its hot slimy channel slowly glide;
7635,PETER GRIMES.,Where the small eels that left the deeper way
7636,PETER GRIMES.,"For the warm shore, within the shallows play;"
7637,PETER GRIMES.,"Where gaping mussels, left upon the mud,"
7638,PETER GRIMES.,Slope their slow passage to the fallen flood; -
7639,PETER GRIMES.,Here dull and hopeless he'd lie down and trace
7640,PETER GRIMES.,"How sidelong crabs had scrawi'd their crooked race,"
7641,PETER GRIMES.,Or sadly listen to the tuneless cry
7642,PETER GRIMES.,Of fishing gull or clanging golden-eye;
7643,PETER GRIMES.,What time the sea-birds to the marsh would come.
7644,PETER GRIMES.,"And the loud bittern, from the bull-rush home,"
7645,PETER GRIMES.,Gave from the salt ditch side the bellowing boom:
7646,PETER GRIMES.,"He nursed the feelings these dull scenes produce,"
7647,PETER GRIMES.,And loved to stop beside the opening sluice;
7648,PETER GRIMES.,"Where the small stream, confined in narrow bound,"
7649,PETER GRIMES.,"Ran with a dull, unvaried, sadd'ning sound;"
7650,PETER GRIMES.,"Where all, presented to the eye or ear,"
7651,PETER GRIMES.,"Oppresss'd the soul with misery, grief, and fear."
7652,PETER GRIMES.,"Besides these objects, there were places three,"
7653,PETER GRIMES.,Which Peter seem'd with certain dread to see;
7654,PETER GRIMES.,"When he drew near them he would turn from each,"
7655,PETER GRIMES.,And loudly whistle till he pass'd the reach.
7656,PETER GRIMES.,"A change of scene to him brought no relief,"
7657,PETER GRIMES.,"In town, 'twas plain, men took him for a thief:"
7658,PETER GRIMES.,"The sailor's wives would stop him in the street,"
7659,PETER GRIMES.,"And say, ""Now, Peter, thou'st no boy to beat;"""
7660,PETER GRIMES.,"Infants at play when they perceived him, ran,"
7661,PETER GRIMES.,"Warning each other--""That's the wicked man;"""
7662,PETER GRIMES.,"He growl'd an oath, and in an angry tone"
7663,PETER GRIMES.,Cursed the whole place and wish'd to be alone.
7664,PETER GRIMES.,"Alone he was, the same dull scenes in view,"
7665,PETER GRIMES.,And still more gloomy in his sight they grew:
7666,PETER GRIMES.,"Though man he hated, yet employ'd alone"
7667,PETER GRIMES.,"At bootless labour, he would swear and groan,"
7668,PETER GRIMES.,"Cursing the shoals that glided by the spot,"
7669,PETER GRIMES.,And gulls that caught them when his arts could not.
7670,PETER GRIMES.,"Cold nervous tremblings shook his sturdy frame,"
7671,PETER GRIMES.,And strange disease--he couldn't say the name;
7672,PETER GRIMES.,"Wild were his dreams, and oft he rose in fright,"
7673,PETER GRIMES.,"Waked by his view of horrors in the night, -"
7674,PETER GRIMES.,"Horrors that would the sternest minds amaze,"
7675,PETER GRIMES.,Horrors that demons might be proud to raise:
7676,PETER GRIMES.,"And though he felt forsaken, grieved at heart,"
7677,PETER GRIMES.,To think he lived from all mankind apart;
7678,PETER GRIMES.,"Yet, if a man approach'd, in terrors he would start."
7679,PETER GRIMES.,"A winter pass'd since Peter saw the town,"
7680,PETER GRIMES.,And summer lodgers were again come down;
7681,PETER GRIMES.,"These, idly curious, with their glasses spied"
7682,PETER GRIMES.,"The ships in bay as anchor'd for the tide, -"
7683,PETER GRIMES.,"The river's craft,--the bustle of the quay, -"
7684,PETER GRIMES.,"And sea-port views, which landmen love to see."
7685,PETER GRIMES.,"One, up the river, had a man and boat"
7686,PETER GRIMES.,"Seen day by day, now anchor'd, now afloat;"
7687,PETER GRIMES.,"Fisher he seem'd, yet used no net nor hook;"
7688,PETER GRIMES.,"Of sea-fowl swimming by no heed he took,"
7689,PETER GRIMES.,But on the gliding waves still fix'd his lazy look:
7690,PETER GRIMES.,"At certain stations he would view the stream,"
7691,PETER GRIMES.,"As if he stood bewilder'd in a dream,"
7692,PETER GRIMES.,"Or that some power had chain'd him for a time,"
7693,PETER GRIMES.,To feel a curse or meditate on crime.
7694,PETER GRIMES.,"This known, some curious, some in pity went,"
7695,PETER GRIMES.,"And others question'd--""Wretch, dost thou repent?"""
7696,PETER GRIMES.,"He heard, he trembled, and in fear resign'd"
7697,PETER GRIMES.,His boat:  new terror fill'd his restless mind;
7698,PETER GRIMES.,"Furious he grew, and up the country ran,"
7699,PETER GRIMES.,And there they seized him--a distemper'd man:  -
7700,PETER GRIMES.,"Him we received, and to a parish-bed,"
7701,PETER GRIMES.,"Follow'd and cursed, the groaning man was led."
7702,PETER GRIMES.,"Here when they saw him, whom they used to shun,"
7703,PETER GRIMES.,"A lost, lone man, so harass'd and undone;"
7704,PETER GRIMES.,"Our gentle females, ever prompt to feel,"
7705,PETER GRIMES.,Perceived compassion on their anger steal;
7706,PETER GRIMES.,"His crimes they could not from their memories blot,"
7707,PETER GRIMES.,"But they were grieved, and trembled at his lot."
7708,PETER GRIMES.,"A priest too came, to whom his words are told;"
7709,PETER GRIMES.,And all the signs they shudder'd to behold.
7710,PETER GRIMES.,"""Look! look!"" they cried; ""His limbs with horror shake"
7711,PETER GRIMES.,"And as he grinds his teeth, what noise they make!"
7712,PETER GRIMES.,"How glare his angry eyes, and yet he's not awake:"
7713,PETER GRIMES.,"See! what cold drops upon his forehead stand,"
7714,PETER GRIMES.,"And how he clenches that broad bony hand."""
7715,PETER GRIMES.,"The Priest attending, found he spoke at times"
7716,PETER GRIMES.,As one alluding to his fears and crimes;
7717,PETER GRIMES.,"""It was the fall,"" he mutter'd, ""I can show"
7718,PETER GRIMES.,"The manner how,--I never struck a blow:"" -"
7719,PETER GRIMES.,"And then aloud,--""Unhand me, free my chain;"
7720,PETER GRIMES.,On oath he fell--it struck him to the brain:  -
7721,PETER GRIMES.,Why ask my father?--that old man will swear
7722,PETER GRIMES.,"Against my life; besides, he wasn't there:"
7723,PETER GRIMES.,"What, all agreed?--Am I to die to-day? -"
7724,PETER GRIMES.,"My Lord, in mercy give me time to pray."""
7725,PETER GRIMES.,"Then as they watch'd him, calmer he became,"
7726,PETER GRIMES.,"And grew so weak he couldn't move his frame,"
7727,PETER GRIMES.,But murmuring spake--while they could see and hear
7728,PETER GRIMES.,The start of terror and the groan of fear;
7729,PETER GRIMES.,"See the large dew-beads on his forehead rise,"
7730,PETER GRIMES.,And the cold death-drop glaze his sunken eyes:
7731,PETER GRIMES.,"Nor yet he died, but with unwonted force"
7732,PETER GRIMES.,Seem'd with some fancied being to discourse:
7733,PETER GRIMES.,"He knew not us, or with accustom'd art"
7734,PETER GRIMES.,"He hid the knowledge, yet exposed his heart;"
7735,PETER GRIMES.,"'Twas part confession and the rest defence,"
7736,PETER GRIMES.,"A madman's tale, with gleams of waking sense."
7737,PETER GRIMES.,"""I'll tell you all,"" he said, ""The very day"
7738,PETER GRIMES.,When the old man first placed them in my way:
7739,PETER GRIMES.,My father's spirit--he who always tried
7740,PETER GRIMES.,"To give me trouble, when he lived and died -"
7741,PETER GRIMES.,When he was gone he could not be content
7742,PETER GRIMES.,"To see my days in painful labour spent,"
7743,PETER GRIMES.,"But would appoint his meetings, and he made"
7744,PETER GRIMES.,"Me watch at these, and so neglect my trade."
7745,PETER GRIMES.,"""'Twas one hot noon, all silent, still, serene,"
7746,PETER GRIMES.,No living being had I lately seen;
7747,PETER GRIMES.,"I paddled up and down and dipp'd my net,"
7748,PETER GRIMES.,"But (such his pleasure) I could nothing get, -"
7749,PETER GRIMES.,"A father's pleasure, when his toil was done,"
7750,PETER GRIMES.,To plague and torture thus an only son!
7751,PETER GRIMES.,"And so I sat and look'd upon the stream,"
7752,PETER GRIMES.,How it ran on and felt as in a dream:
7753,PETER GRIMES.,But dream it was not:  No!--I fix'd my eyes
7754,PETER GRIMES.,On the mid stream and saw the spirits rise:
7755,PETER GRIMES.,"I saw my father on the water stand,"
7756,PETER GRIMES.,And hold a thin pale boy in either hand;
7757,PETER GRIMES.,And there they glided ghastly on the top
7758,PETER GRIMES.,"Of the salt flood, and never touch'd a drop:"
7759,PETER GRIMES.,"I would have struck them, but they knew th' intent,"
7760,PETER GRIMES.,"And smiled upon the oar, and down they went."
7761,PETER GRIMES.,"""Now, from that day, whenever I began"
7762,PETER GRIMES.,"To dip my net, there stood the hard old man -"
7763,PETER GRIMES.,He and those boys:  I humbled me and pray'd
7764,PETER GRIMES.,"They would be gone; they heeded not, but stay'd:"
7765,PETER GRIMES.,"Nor could I turn, nor would the boat go by,"
7766,PETER GRIMES.,"But, gazing on the spirits, there was I:"
7767,PETER GRIMES.,"They bade me leap to death, but I was loth to die:"
7768,PETER GRIMES.,"And every day, as sure as day arose,"
7769,PETER GRIMES.,Would these three spirits meet me ere the close;
7770,PETER GRIMES.,"To hear and mark them daily was my doom,"
7771,PETER GRIMES.,"And 'Come,' they said, with weak, sad voices, 'Come.'"
7772,PETER GRIMES.,"To row away, with all my strength I tried,"
7773,PETER GRIMES.,"But there were they hard by me in the tide,"
7774,PETER GRIMES.,"The three unbodied forms--and 'Come, still come,' they cried."
7775,PETER GRIMES.,"""Fathers should pity--but this old man shook"
7776,PETER GRIMES.,"His hoary locks, and froze me by a look:"
7777,PETER GRIMES.,"Thrice when I struck them, through the water came"
7778,PETER GRIMES.,"A hollow groan, that weaken'd all my frame:"
7779,PETER GRIMES.,"'Father!' said I, 'Have mercy:' he replied,"
7780,PETER GRIMES.,"I know not what--the angry spirit lied, -"
7781,PETER GRIMES.,"'Didst thou not draw thy knife?' said he: --'Twas true,"
7782,PETER GRIMES.,But I had pity and my arm withdrew:
7783,PETER GRIMES.,"He cried for mercy, which I kindly gave,"
7784,PETER GRIMES.,But he has no compassion in his grave.
7785,PETER GRIMES.,"""There were three places, where they ever rose, -"
7786,PETER GRIMES.,The whole long river has not such as those -
7787,PETER GRIMES.,"Places accursed, where, if a man remain,"
7788,PETER GRIMES.,He'll see the things which strike him to the brain;
7789,PETER GRIMES.,"And there they made me on my paddle lean,"
7790,PETER GRIMES.,And look at them for hours;--accursed scene!
7791,PETER GRIMES.,"When they would glide to that smooth eddy-space,"
7792,PETER GRIMES.,Then bid me leap and join them in the place;
7793,PETER GRIMES.,And at my groans each little villain sprite
7794,PETER GRIMES.,Enjoy'd my pains and vanish'd in delight.
7795,PETER GRIMES.,"""In one fierce summer-day, when my poor brain"
7796,PETER GRIMES.,"Was burning hot, and cruel was my pain,"
7797,PETER GRIMES.,"Then came this father-foe, and there he stood"
7798,PETER GRIMES.,With his two boys again upon the flood:
7799,PETER GRIMES.,"There was more mischief in their eyes, more glee"
7800,PETER GRIMES.,"In their pale faces, when they glared at me:"
7801,PETER GRIMES.,"Still they did force me on the oar to rest,"
7802,PETER GRIMES.,"And when they saw me fainting and oppress'd,"
7803,PETER GRIMES.,"He with his hand, the old man, scoop'd the flood,"
7804,PETER GRIMES.,And there came flame about him mix'd with blood;
7805,PETER GRIMES.,"He bade me stoop and look upon the place,"
7806,PETER GRIMES.,Then flung the hot-red liquor in my face;
7807,PETER GRIMES.,"Burning it blazed, and then I roar'd for pain,"
7808,PETER GRIMES.,I thought the demons would have turn'd my brain.
7809,PETER GRIMES.,"""Still there they stood, and forced me to behold"
7810,PETER GRIMES.,A place of horrors--they can not be told -
7811,PETER GRIMES.,"Where the flood open'd, there I heard the shriek"
7812,PETER GRIMES.,Of tortured guilt--no earthly tongue can speak:
7813,PETER GRIMES.,"'All days alike! for ever!' did they say,"
7814,PETER GRIMES.,'And unremitted torments every day' -
7815,PETER GRIMES.,"Yes, so they said""--But here he ceased and gazed"
7816,PETER GRIMES.,"On all around, affrighten'd and amazed;"
7817,PETER GRIMES.,"And still he tried to speak, and look'd in dread"
7818,PETER GRIMES.,Of frighten'd females gathering round his bed;
7819,PETER GRIMES.,"Then dropp'd exhausted, and appear'd at rest,"
7820,PETER GRIMES.,Till the strong foe the vital powers possess'd;
7821,PETER GRIMES.,"Then with an inward, broken voice he cried,"
7822,PETER GRIMES.,"""Again they come!"" and mutter'd as he died.  {13}"

7939,PRISONS. {14},"Those whom no calls, no warnings could divert,"
7940,PRISONS. {14},"The unexperienced, and the inexpert;"
7941,PRISONS. {14},"The builder, idler, schemer, gamester, sot, -"
7942,PRISONS. {14},"The follies different, but the same their lot;"
7943,PRISONS. {14},"Victims of horses, lasses, drinking, dice,"
7944,PRISONS. {14},"Of every passion, humour, whim, and vice."
7945,PRISONS. {14},"See! that sad Merchant, who but yesterday"
7946,PRISONS. {14},Had a vast household in command and pay;
7947,PRISONS. {14},He now entreats permission to employ
7948,PRISONS. {14},"A boy he needs, and then entreats the boy."
7949,PRISONS. {14},"And there sits one improvident but kind,"
7950,PRISONS. {14},"Bound for a friend, whom honour could not bind;"
7951,PRISONS. {14},"Sighing, he speaks to any who appear,"
7952,PRISONS. {14},"""A treach'rous friend--'twas that which sent me here:"
7953,PRISONS. {14},"I was too kind,--I thought I could depend"
7954,PRISONS. {14},"On his bare word--he was a treach'rous friend."""
7955,PRISONS. {14},"A Female too!--it is to her a home,"
7956,PRISONS. {14},She came before--and she again will come:
7957,PRISONS. {14},"Her friends have pity; when their anger drops,"
7958,PRISONS. {14},They take her home;--she's tried her schools and shops -
7959,PRISONS. {14},"Plan after plan;--but fortune would not mend,"
7960,PRISONS. {14},She to herself was still the treach'rous friend;
7961,PRISONS. {14},"And wheresoe'er began, all here was sure to end:"
7962,PRISONS. {14},"And there she sits, as thoughtless and as gay"
7963,PRISONS. {14},"As if she'd means, or not a debt to pay -"
7964,PRISONS. {14},Or knew to-morrow she'd be call'd away -
7965,PRISONS. {14},Or felt a shilling and could dine to-day.
7966,PRISONS. {14},"While thus observing, I began to trace"
7967,PRISONS. {14},The sober'd features of a well-known face -
7968,PRISONS. {14},"Looks once familiar, manners form'd to please,"
7969,PRISONS. {14},And all illumined by a heart at ease:
7970,PRISONS. {14},But fraud and flattery ever claim'd a part
7971,PRISONS. {14},(Still unresisted) of that easy heart;
7972,PRISONS. {14},"But he at length beholds me--""Ah! my friend!"
7973,PRISONS. {14},"""And have thy pleasures this unlucky end?"""
7974,PRISONS. {14},"""Too sure,"" he said, and smiling as he sigh'd;"
7975,PRISONS. {14},"""I went astray, though Prudence seem'd my guide;"
7976,PRISONS. {14},"All she proposed I in my heart approved,"
7977,PRISONS. {14},"And she was honour'd, but my pleasure loved -"
7978,PRISONS. {14},"Pleasure, the mistress to whose arms I fled,"
7979,PRISONS. {14},From wife-like lectures angry Prudence read.
7980,PRISONS. {14},"""Why speak the madness of a life like mine,"
7981,PRISONS. {14},"The powers of beauty, novelty, and wine?"
7982,PRISONS. {14},"Why paint the wanton smile, the venal vow,"
7983,PRISONS. {14},Or friends whose worth I can appreciate now;
7984,PRISONS. {14},"Oft I perceived my fate, and then could say,"
7985,PRISONS. {14},"I'll think to-morrow, I must live to-day:"
7986,PRISONS. {14},So am I here--I own the laws are just -
7987,PRISONS. {14},"And here, where thought is painful, think I must:"
7988,PRISONS. {14},But speech is pleasant; this discourse with thee
7989,PRISONS. {14},"Brings to my mind the sweets of liberty,"
7990,PRISONS. {14},"Breaks on the sameness of the place, and gives"
7991,PRISONS. {14},The doubtful heart conviction that it lives.
7992,PRISONS. {14},"""Let me describe my anguish in the hour"
7993,PRISONS. {14},When law detain'd me and I felt its power.
7994,PRISONS. {14},"""When, in that shipwreck, this I found my shore,"
7995,PRISONS. {14},"And join'd the wretched, who were wreck'd before;"
7996,PRISONS. {14},"When I perceived each feature in the face,"
7997,PRISONS. {14},Pinch'd through neglect or turbid by disgrace;
7998,PRISONS. {14},When in these wasting forms affliction stood
7999,PRISONS. {14},"In my afiiicted view, it chill'd my blood; -"
8000,PRISONS. {14},"And forth I rush'd, a quick retreat to make,"
8001,PRISONS. {14},Till a loud laugh proclaim'd the dire mistake:
8002,PRISONS. {14},"But when the groan had settled to a sigh,"
8003,PRISONS. {14},"When gloom became familiar to the eye,"
8004,PRISONS. {14},"When I perceive how others seem to rest,"
8005,PRISONS. {14},"With every evil rankling in my breast, -"
8006,PRISONS. {14},"Led by example, I put on the man,"
8007,PRISONS. {14},"Sing off my sighs, and trifle as I can."
8008,PRISONS. {14},"""Homer! nay Pope! (for never will I seek"
8009,PRISONS. {14},Applause for learning--nought have I with Greek)
8010,PRISONS. {14},"Gives us the secrets of his pagan hell,"
8011,PRISONS. {14},Where ghost with ghost in sad communion dwell;
8012,PRISONS. {14},"Where shade meets shade, and round the gloomy meads"
8013,PRISONS. {14},"They glide, and speak of old heroic deeds, -"
8014,PRISONS. {14},"What fields they conquer'd, and what foes they slew,"
8015,PRISONS. {14},And sent to join the melancholy crew.
8016,PRISONS. {14},"When a new spirit in that world was found,"
8017,PRISONS. {14},A thousand shadowy forms came flitting round:
8018,PRISONS. {14},"Those who had known him, fond inquiries made, -"
8019,PRISONS. {14},"'Of all we left, inform us, gentle shade,"
8020,PRISONS. {14},"Now as we lead thee in our realms to dwell,"
8021,PRISONS. {14},"Our twilight groves, and meads of asphodel.'"
8022,PRISONS. {14},"""What paints the poet, is our station here,"
8023,PRISONS. {14},Where we like ghosts and flitting shades appear:
8024,PRISONS. {14},"This is the hell he sings, and here we meet,"
8025,PRISONS. {14},And former deeds to new-made friends repeat;
8026,PRISONS. {14},"Heroic deeds, which here obtain us fame,"
8027,PRISONS. {14},And are in fact the causes why we came:
8028,PRISONS. {14},"Yes! this dim region is old Homer's hell,"
8029,PRISONS. {14},Abate but groves and meads of asphodel.
8030,PRISONS. {14},"Here, when a stranger from your world we spy,"
8031,PRISONS. {14},We gather round him and for news apply;
8032,PRISONS. {14},"He hears unheeding, nor can speech endure,"
8033,PRISONS. {14},But shivering gazes on the vast obscure:
8034,PRISONS. {14},"We smiling pity, and by kindness show"
8035,PRISONS. {14},We felt his feelings and his terrors know;
8036,PRISONS. {14},"Then speak of comfort--time will give him sight,"
8037,PRISONS. {14},Where now 'tis dark; where now 'tis woe--delight.
8038,PRISONS. {14},"'Have hope,' we say, 'and soon the place to thee"
8039,PRISONS. {14},Shall not a prison but a castle be:
8040,PRISONS. {14},"When to the wretch whom care and guilt confound,"
8041,PRISONS. {14},"The world's a prison, with a wider bound;"
8042,PRISONS. {14},"Go where he may, he feels himself confined,"
8043,PRISONS. {14},And wears the fetters of an abject mind.'
8044,PRISONS. {14},"""But now adieu! those giant-keys appear,"
8045,PRISONS. {14},Thou art not worthy to be inmate here:
8046,PRISONS. {14},"Go to thy world, and to the young declare"
8047,PRISONS. {14},"What we, our spirits and employments, are;"
8048,PRISONS. {14},"Tell them how we the ills of life endure,"
8049,PRISONS. {14},"Our empire stable, and our state secure;"
8050,PRISONS. {14},"Our dress, our diet, for their use describe,"
8051,PRISONS. {14},And bid them haste to join the gen'rous tribe:
8052,PRISONS. {14},"Go to thy world, and leave us here to dwell,"
8053,PRISONS. {14},"Who to its joys and comforts bid farewell."""
8054,PRISONS. {14},"Farewell to these; but other scenes I view,"
8055,PRISONS. {14},"And other griefs, and guilt of deeper hue;"
8056,PRISONS. {14},"Where Conscience gives to outward ills her pain,"
8057,PRISONS. {14},"Gloom to the night, and pressure to the chain:"
8058,PRISONS. {14},Here separate cells awhile in misery keep
8059,PRISONS. {14},Two doom'd to suffer:  there they strive for sleep;
8060,PRISONS. {14},"By day indulged, in larger space they range,"
8061,PRISONS. {14},"Their bondage certain, but their bounds have change."
8062,PRISONS. {14},"One was a female, who had grievous ill"
8063,PRISONS. {14},"Wrought in revenge, and she enjoy'd it still:"
8064,PRISONS. {14},"With death before her, and her fate in view,"
8065,PRISONS. {14},Unsated vengeance in her bosom grew:
8066,PRISONS. {14},Sullen she was and threat'ning; in her eye
8067,PRISONS. {14},Glared the stern triumph that she dared to die:
8068,PRISONS. {14},But first a being in the world must leave -
8069,PRISONS. {14},'Twas once reproach; 'twas now a short reprieve.
8070,PRISONS. {14},"She was a pauper bound, who early gave"
8071,PRISONS. {14},Her mind to vice and doubly was a slave:
8072,PRISONS. {14},"Upbraided, beaten, held by rough control,"
8073,PRISONS. {14},"Revenge sustain'd, inspired, and fill'd her soul:"
8074,PRISONS. {14},"She fired a full-stored barn, confess'd the fact,"
8075,PRISONS. {14},And laugh'd at law and justified the act:
8076,PRISONS. {14},"Our gentle Vicar tried his powers in vain,"
8077,PRISONS. {14},"She answer'd not, or answer'd with disdain;"
8078,PRISONS. {14},"Th' approaching fate she heard without a sigh,"
8079,PRISONS. {14},And neither cared to live nor fear'd to die.
8080,PRISONS. {14},"Not so he felt, who with her was to pay"
8081,PRISONS. {14},"The forfeit, life--with dread he view'd the day,"
8082,PRISONS. {14},"And that short space which yet for him remain'd,"
8083,PRISONS. {14},Till with his limbs his faculties were chain'd:
8084,PRISONS. {14},"He paced his narrow bounds some ease to find,"
8085,PRISONS. {14},"But found it not,--no comfort reach'd his mind:"
8086,PRISONS. {14},"Each sense was palsied; when he tasted food,"
8087,PRISONS. {14},"He sigh'd and said, ""Enough--'tis very good."""
8088,PRISONS. {14},"Since his dread sentence, nothing seem'd to be"
8089,PRISONS. {14},"As once it was--he seeing could not see,"
8090,PRISONS. {14},"Nor hearing, hear aright;--when first I came"
8091,PRISONS. {14},"Within his view, I fancied there was shame,"
8092,PRISONS. {14},"I judged resentment; I mistook the air, -"
8093,PRISONS. {14},These fainter passions live not with despair;
8094,PRISONS. {14},"Or but exist and die: --Hope, fear, and love,"
8095,PRISONS. {14},"Joy, doubt, and hate, may other spirits move,"
8096,PRISONS. {14},"But touch not his, who every waking hour"
8097,PRISONS. {14},"Has one fix'd dread, and always feels its power."
8098,PRISONS. {14},"""But will not mercy?""--No! she cannot plead"
8099,PRISONS. {14},For such an outrage;--'twas a cruel deed:
8100,PRISONS. {14},"He stopp'd a timid traveller;--to his breast,"
8101,PRISONS. {14},"With oaths and curses, was the danger press'd:  -"
8102,PRISONS. {14},No! he must suffer:  pity we may find
8103,PRISONS. {14},"For one man's pangs, but must not wrong mankind."
8104,PRISONS. {14},"Still I behold him, every thought employ'd"
8105,PRISONS. {14},On one dire view!--all others are destroy'd;
8106,PRISONS. {14},"This makes his features ghastly, gives the tone"
8107,PRISONS. {14},Of his few words resemblance to a groan;
8108,PRISONS. {14},"He takes his tasteless food, and when 'tis done,"
8109,PRISONS. {14},"Counts up his meals, now lessen'd by that one;"
8110,PRISONS. {14},"For expectation is on time intent,"
8111,PRISONS. {14},Whether he brings us joy or punishment.
8112,PRISONS. {14},"Yes! e'en in sleep the impressions all remain,"
8113,PRISONS. {14},He hears the sentence and he feels the chain;
8114,PRISONS. {14},"He sees the judge and jury, when he shakes,"
8115,PRISONS. {14},"And loudly cries, ""Not guilty,"" and awakes:"
8116,PRISONS. {14},"Then chilling tremblings o'er his body creep,"
8117,PRISONS. {14},Till worn-out nature is compell'd to sleep.
8118,PRISONS. {14},"Now comes the dream again:  it shows each scene,"
8119,PRISONS. {14},With each small circumstance that comes between -
8120,PRISONS. {14},The call to suffering and the very deed -
8121,PRISONS. {14},"There crowds go with him, follow, and precede;"
8122,PRISONS. {14},"Some heartless shout, some pity, all condemn,"
8123,PRISONS. {14},While he in fancied envy looks at them:
8124,PRISONS. {14},"He seems the place for that sad act to see,"
8125,PRISONS. {14},And dreams the very thirst which then will be:
8126,PRISONS. {14},"A priest attends--it seems, the one he knew"
8127,PRISONS. {14},"In his best days, beneath whose care he grew."
8128,PRISONS. {14},"At this his terrors take a sudden flight,"
8129,PRISONS. {14},He sees his native village with delight;
8130,PRISONS. {14},"The house, the chamber, where he once array'd"
8131,PRISONS. {14},His youthful person; where he knelt and pray'd:
8132,PRISONS. {14},"Then too the comforts he enjoy'd at home,"
8133,PRISONS. {14},The days of joy; the joys themselves are come; -
8134,PRISONS. {14},The hours of innocence;--the timid look
8135,PRISONS. {14},"Of his loved maid, when first her hand he took,"
8136,PRISONS. {14},"And told his hope; her trembling joy appears,"
8137,PRISONS. {14},Her forced reserve and his retreating fears.
8138,PRISONS. {14},All now is present;--'tis a moment's gleam
8139,PRISONS. {14},"Of former sunshine--stay, delightful dream!"
8140,PRISONS. {14},"Let him within his pleasant garden walk,"
8141,PRISONS. {14},"Give him her arm, of blessings let them talk."
8142,PRISONS. {14},"Yes! all are with him now, and all the while"
8143,PRISONS. {14},Life's early prospects and his Fanny's smile:
8144,PRISONS. {14},"Then come his sister and his village-friend,"
8145,PRISONS. {14},And he will now the sweetest moments spend
8146,PRISONS. {14},Life has to yield;--No! never will he find
8147,PRISONS. {14},Again on earth such pleasure in his mind:
8148,PRISONS. {14},"He goes through shrubby walks these friends among,"
8149,PRISONS. {14},Love in their looks and honour on the tongue:
8150,PRISONS. {14},"Nay, there's a charm beyond what nature shows,"
8151,PRISONS. {14},The bloom is softer and more sweetly glows; -
8152,PRISONS. {14},"Pierced by no crime, and urged by no desire"
8153,PRISONS. {14},"For more than true and honest hearts require,"
8154,PRISONS. {14},"They feel the calm delight, and thus proceed"
8155,PRISONS. {14},"Through the green lane,--then linger in the mead, -"
8156,PRISONS. {14},"Stray o'er the heath in all its purple bloom, -"
8157,PRISONS. {14},And pluck the blossom where the wild bees hum;
8158,PRISONS. {14},"Then through the broomy bound with ease they pass,"
8159,PRISONS. {14},"And press the sandy sheep-walk's slender grass,"
8160,PRISONS. {14},"Where dwarfish flowers among the gorse are spread,"
8161,PRISONS. {14},And the lamb browses by the linnet's bed;
8162,PRISONS. {14},Then 'cross the bounding brook they make their way
8163,PRISONS. {14},O'er its rough bridge--and there behold the bay! -
8164,PRISONS. {14},The ocean smiling to the fervid sun -
8165,PRISONS. {14},The waves that faintly fall and slowly run -
8166,PRISONS. {14},The ships at distance and the boats at hand;
8167,PRISONS. {14},"And now they walk upon the sea-side sand,"
8168,PRISONS. {14},"Counting the number and what kind they be,"
8169,PRISONS. {14},Ships softly sinking in the sleepy sea:
8170,PRISONS. {14},"Now arm in arm, now parted, they behold"
8171,PRISONS. {14},The glitt'ring waters on the shingles roll'd:
8172,PRISONS. {14},"The timid girls, half dreading their design,"
8173,PRISONS. {14},"Dip the small foot in the retarded brine,"
8174,PRISONS. {14},"And search for crimson weeds, which spreading flow,"
8175,PRISONS. {14},Or lie like pictures on the sand below;
8176,PRISONS. {14},"With all those bright red pebbles, that the sun"
8177,PRISONS. {14},Through the small waves so softly shines upon;
8178,PRISONS. {14},And those live lucid jellies which the eye
8179,PRISONS. {14},Delights to trace as they swim glittering by:
8180,PRISONS. {14},"Pearl-shells and rubied star-fish they admire,"
8181,PRISONS. {14},"And will arrange above the parlour fire, -"
8182,PRISONS. {14},"Tokens of bliss!--""Oh! horrible! a wave"
8183,PRISONS. {14},"Roars as it rises--save me, Edward! save!"""
8184,PRISONS. {14},She cries: --Alas! the watchman on his way
8185,PRISONS. {14},"Calls, and lets in--truth, terror, and the day!"

8252,SCHOOLS. {15},"Though deaf, she sees the rebel-heroes shout, -"
8253,SCHOOLS. {15},"Though lame, her white rod nimbly walks about;"
8254,SCHOOLS. {15},"With band of yarn she keeps offenders in,"
8255,SCHOOLS. {15},And to her gown the sturdiest rogue can pin:
8256,SCHOOLS. {15},"Aided by these, and spells, and tell-tale birds,"
8257,SCHOOLS. {15},Her power they dread and reverence her words.
8258,SCHOOLS. {15},"To Learning's second seats we now proceed,"
8259,SCHOOLS. {15},Where humming students gilded primers read;
8260,SCHOOLS. {15},"Or books with letters large and pictures gay,"
8261,SCHOOLS. {15},To make their reading but a kind of play -
8262,SCHOOLS. {15},"""Reading made easy,"" so the titles tell;"
8263,SCHOOLS. {15},But they who read must first begin to spell:
8264,SCHOOLS. {15},"There may be profit in these arts, but still"
8265,SCHOOLS. {15},"Learning is labour, call it what you will;"
8266,SCHOOLS. {15},"Upon the youthful mind a heavy load,"
8267,SCHOOLS. {15},Nor must we hope to find the royal road.
8268,SCHOOLS. {15},"Some will their easy steps to science show,"
8269,SCHOOLS. {15},And some to heav'n itself their by-way know;
8270,SCHOOLS. {15},"Ah! trust them not,--who fame or bliss would share,"
8271,SCHOOLS. {15},"Must learn by labour, and must live by care."
8272,SCHOOLS. {15},"Another matron, of superior kind,"
8273,SCHOOLS. {15},For higher schools prepares the rising mind;
8274,SCHOOLS. {15},"Preparatory she her Learning calls,"
8275,SCHOOLS. {15},The step first made to colleges and halls.
8276,SCHOOLS. {15},"She early sees to what the mind will grow,"
8277,SCHOOLS. {15},Nor abler judge of infant-powers I know:
8278,SCHOOLS. {15},"She sees what soon the lively will impede,"
8279,SCHOOLS. {15},And how the steadier will in turn succeed;
8280,SCHOOLS. {15},"Observes the dawn of wisdom, fancy, taste,"
8281,SCHOOLS. {15},"And knows what parts will wear, and what will waste:"
8282,SCHOOLS. {15},"She marks the mind too lively, and at once"
8283,SCHOOLS. {15},Sees the gay coxcomb and the rattling dunce.
8284,SCHOOLS. {15},"Long has she lived, and much she loves to trace"
8285,SCHOOLS. {15},"Her former pupils, now a lordly race;"
8286,SCHOOLS. {15},"Whom when she sees rich robes and furs bedeck,"
8287,SCHOOLS. {15},She marks the pride which once she strove to check.
8288,SCHOOLS. {15},"A Burgess comes, and she remembers well"
8289,SCHOOLS. {15},How hard her task to make his worship spell;
8290,SCHOOLS. {15},"Cold, selfish, dull, inanimate, unkind,"
8291,SCHOOLS. {15},'Twas but by anger he display'd a mind:
8292,SCHOOLS. {15},"Now civil, smiling, complaisant, and gay,"
8293,SCHOOLS. {15},The world has worn th' unsocial crust away:
8294,SCHOOLS. {15},"That sullen spirit now a softness wears,"
8295,SCHOOLS. {15},"And, save by fits, e'en dulness disappears:"
8296,SCHOOLS. {15},"But still the matron can the man behold,"
8297,SCHOOLS. {15},"Dull, selfish, hard, inanimate, and cold."
8298,SCHOOLS. {15},"A Merchant passes,--""Probity and truth,"
8299,SCHOOLS. {15},"Prudence and patience, mark'd thee from thy youth."""
8300,SCHOOLS. {15},"Thus she observes, but oft retains her fears"
8301,SCHOOLS. {15},"For him, who now with name unstain'd appears:"
8302,SCHOOLS. {15},"Nor hope relinquishes, for one who yet"
8303,SCHOOLS. {15},Is lost in error and involved in debt;
8304,SCHOOLS. {15},"For latent evil in that heart she found,"
8305,SCHOOLS. {15},"More open here, but here the core was sound."
8306,SCHOOLS. {15},Various our Day-Schools:  here behold we one
8307,SCHOOLS. {15},"Empty and still: --the morning duties done,"
8308,SCHOOLS. {15},"Soil'd, tatter'd, worn, and thrown in various heaps,"
8309,SCHOOLS. {15},"Appear their books, and there confusion sleeps;"
8310,SCHOOLS. {15},"The workmen all are from the Babel fled,"
8311,SCHOOLS. {15},"And lost their tools, till the return they dread:"
8312,SCHOOLS. {15},"Meantime the master, with his wig awry,"
8313,SCHOOLS. {15},Prepares his books for business by-and-by:
8314,SCHOOLS. {15},Now all th' insignia of the monarch laid
8315,SCHOOLS. {15},"Beside him rest, and none stand by afraid;"
8316,SCHOOLS. {15},"He, while his troop light-hearted leap and play,"
8317,SCHOOLS. {15},Is all intent on duties of the day;
8318,SCHOOLS. {15},"No more the tyrant stern or judge severe,"
8319,SCHOOLS. {15},He feels the father's and the husband's fear.
8320,SCHOOLS. {15},"Ah! little think the timid trembling crowd,"
8321,SCHOOLS. {15},"That one so wise, so powerful, and so proud,"
8322,SCHOOLS. {15},"Should feel himself, and dread the humble ills"
8323,SCHOOLS. {15},"Of rent-day charges, and of coalman's bills;"
8324,SCHOOLS. {15},"That while they mercy from their judge implore,"
8325,SCHOOLS. {15},He fears himself--a knocking at the door;
8326,SCHOOLS. {15},And feels the burthen as his neighbour states
8327,SCHOOLS. {15},His humble portion to the parish-rates.
8328,SCHOOLS. {15},"They sit th' alloted hours, then eager run,"
8329,SCHOOLS. {15},Rushing to pleasure when the duty's done;
8330,SCHOOLS. {15},"His hour of leisure is of different kind,"
8331,SCHOOLS. {15},"Then cares domestic rush upon his mind,"
8332,SCHOOLS. {15},"And half the ease and comfort he enjoys,"
8333,SCHOOLS. {15},"Is when surrounded by slates, books, and boys."
8334,SCHOOLS. {15},Poor Reuben Dixon has the noisiest school
8335,SCHOOLS. {15},"Of ragged lads, who ever bow'd to rule;"
8336,SCHOOLS. {15},"Low in his price--the men who heave our coals,"
8337,SCHOOLS. {15},"And clean our causeways, send him boys in shoals;"
8338,SCHOOLS. {15},"To see poor Reuben, with his fry beside, -"
8339,SCHOOLS. {15},"Their half-check'd rudeness and his half-scorn'd pride, -"
8340,SCHOOLS. {15},"Their room, the sty in which th' assembly meet,"
8341,SCHOOLS. {15},In the close lane behind the Northgate-street;
8342,SCHOOLS. {15},"T'observe his vain attempts to keep the peace,"
8343,SCHOOLS. {15},"Till tolls the bell, and strife and troubles cease, -"
8344,SCHOOLS. {15},"Calls for our praise; his labour praise deserves,"
8345,SCHOOLS. {15},But not our pity; Reuben has no nerves:
8346,SCHOOLS. {15},"'Mid noise and dirt, and stench, and play, and prate,"
8347,SCHOOLS. {15},He calmly cuts the pen or views the slate.
8348,SCHOOLS. {15},"But Leonard!--yes, for Leonard's fate I grieve,"
8349,SCHOOLS. {15},Who loaths the station which he dares not leave:
8350,SCHOOLS. {15},"He cannot dig, he will not beg his bread,"
8351,SCHOOLS. {15},All his dependence rests upon his head;
8352,SCHOOLS. {15},"And deeply skill'd in sciences and arts,"
8353,SCHOOLS. {15},On vulgar lads he wastes superior parts.
8354,SCHOOLS. {15},"Alas! what grief that feeling mind sustains,"
8355,SCHOOLS. {15},In guiding hands and stirring torpid brains;
8356,SCHOOLS. {15},"He whose proud mind from pole to pole will move,"
8357,SCHOOLS. {15},And view the wonders of the worlds above;
8358,SCHOOLS. {15},"Who thinks and reasons strongly: --hard his fate,"
8359,SCHOOLS. {15},Confined for ever to the pen and slate:
8360,SCHOOLS. {15},"True, he submits, and when the long dull day"
8361,SCHOOLS. {15},"Has slowly pass'd, in weary tasks, away,"
8362,SCHOOLS. {15},"To other worlds with cheerful view he looks,"
8363,SCHOOLS. {15},And parts the night between repose and books.
8364,SCHOOLS. {15},"Amid his labours, he has sometimes tried"
8365,SCHOOLS. {15},To turn a little from his cares aside;
8366,SCHOOLS. {15},"Pope, Milton, Dryden, with delight has seized,"
8367,SCHOOLS. {15},His soul engaged and of his trouble eased:
8368,SCHOOLS. {15},"When, with a heavy eye and ill-done sum,"
8369,SCHOOLS. {15},"No part conceived, a stupid boy will come;"
8370,SCHOOLS. {15},"Then Leonard first subdues the rising frown,"
8371,SCHOOLS. {15},And bids the blockhead lay his blunders down;
8372,SCHOOLS. {15},"O'er which disgusted he will turn his eye,"
8373,SCHOOLS. {15},"To his sad duty his sound mind apply,"
8374,SCHOOLS. {15},"And, vex'd in spirit, throw his pleasures by."
8375,SCHOOLS. {15},Turn we to Schools which more than these afford -
8376,SCHOOLS. {15},The sound instruction and the wholesome board;
8377,SCHOOLS. {15},And first our School for Ladies;--pity calls
8378,SCHOOLS. {15},"For one soft sigh, when we behold these walls,"
8379,SCHOOLS. {15},"Placed near the town, and where, from window high,"
8380,SCHOOLS. {15},"The fair, confined, may our free crowds espy,"
8381,SCHOOLS. {15},"With many a stranger gazing up and down,"
8382,SCHOOLS. {15},And all the envied tumult of the town;
8383,SCHOOLS. {15},"May, in the smiling summer-eve, when they"
8384,SCHOOLS. {15},"Are sent to sleep the pleasant hours away,"
8385,SCHOOLS. {15},Behold the poor (whom they conceive the bless'd)
8386,SCHOOLS. {15},"Employ'd for hours, and grieved they cannot rest."
8387,SCHOOLS. {15},"Here the fond girl, whose days are sad and few"
8388,SCHOOLS. {15},"Since dear mamma pronounced the last adieu,"
8389,SCHOOLS. {15},"Looks to the road, and fondly thinks she hears"
8390,SCHOOLS. {15},"The carriage-wheels, and struggles with her tears:"
8391,SCHOOLS. {15},"All yet is new, the misses great and small,"
8392,SCHOOLS. {15},"Madam herself, and teachers, odious all;"
8393,SCHOOLS. {15},"From laughter, pity, nay command, she turns,"
8394,SCHOOLS. {15},"But melts in softness, or with anger burns;"
8395,SCHOOLS. {15},"Nauseates her food, and wonders who can sleep"
8396,SCHOOLS. {15},"On such mean beds, where she can only weep:"
8397,SCHOOLS. {15},She scorns condolence--but to all she hates
8398,SCHOOLS. {15},Slowly at length her mind accommodates;
8399,SCHOOLS. {15},Then looks on bondage with the same concern
8400,SCHOOLS. {15},"As others felt, and finds that she must learn"
8401,SCHOOLS. {15},"As others learn'd--the common lot to share,"
8402,SCHOOLS. {15},To search for comfort and submit to care.
8403,SCHOOLS. {15},"There are, 'tis said, who on these seats attend,"
8404,SCHOOLS. {15},And to these ductile minds destruction vend;
8405,SCHOOLS. {15},"Wretches--(to virtue, peace, and nature, foes) -"
8406,SCHOOLS. {15},"To these soft minds, their wicked trash expose;"
8407,SCHOOLS. {15},"Seize on the soul, ere passions take the sway,"
8408,SCHOOLS. {15},"And lead the heart, ere yet it feels, astray:"
8409,SCHOOLS. {15},Smugglers obscene!--and can there be who take
8410,SCHOOLS. {15},Infernal pains the sleeping vice to wake?
8411,SCHOOLS. {15},Can there be those by whom the thought defiled
8412,SCHOOLS. {15},Enters the spotless bosom of a child?
8413,SCHOOLS. {15},"By whom the ill is to the heart conveyed,"
8414,SCHOOLS. {15},"Who lend the foe, not yet in arms, their aid;"
8415,SCHOOLS. {15},And sap the city-walls before the siege be laid?
8416,SCHOOLS. {15},"Oh! rather skulking in the by-ways steal,"
8417,SCHOOLS. {15},And rob the poorest traveller of his meal;
8418,SCHOOLS. {15},Burst through the humblest trader's bolted door;
8419,SCHOOLS. {15},Bear from the widow's hut her winter-store;
8420,SCHOOLS. {15},"With stolen steed, on highways take your stand,"
8421,SCHOOLS. {15},"Your lips with curses arm'd, with death your hand; -"
8422,SCHOOLS. {15},"Take all but life--the virtuous more would say,"
8423,SCHOOLS. {15},"Take life itself, dear as it is, away,"
8424,SCHOOLS. {15},Rather than guilty thus the guileless soul betray.
8425,SCHOOLS. {15},"Years pass away--let us suppose them past,"
8426,SCHOOLS. {15},Th' accomplish'd nymph for freedom looks at last;
8427,SCHOOLS. {15},"All hardships over, which a school contains,"
8428,SCHOOLS. {15},The spirit's bondage and the body's pains;
8429,SCHOOLS. {15},"Where teachers make the heartless, trembling set"
8430,SCHOOLS. {15},Of pupils suffer for their own regret;
8431,SCHOOLS. {15},"Where winter's cold, attack'd by one poor fire,"
8432,SCHOOLS. {15},"Chills the fair child, commanded to retire;"
8433,SCHOOLS. {15},"She felt it keenly in the morning-air,"
8434,SCHOOLS. {15},Keenly she felt it at the evening prayer.
8435,SCHOOLS. {15},"More pleasant summer; but then walks were made,"
8436,SCHOOLS. {15},"Not a sweet ramble, but a slow parade;"
8437,SCHOOLS. {15},"They moved by pairs beside the hawthorn-hedge,"
8438,SCHOOLS. {15},Only to set their feelings on an edge;
8439,SCHOOLS. {15},"And now at eve, when all their spirits rise,"
8440,SCHOOLS. {15},"Are sent to rest, and all their pleasure dies;"
8441,SCHOOLS. {15},"Where yet they all the town-alert can see,"
8442,SCHOOLS. {15},And distant plough-boys pacing o'er the lea.
8443,SCHOOLS. {15},These and the tasks successive masters brought -
8444,SCHOOLS. {15},"The French they conn'd, the curious works they wrought;"
8445,SCHOOLS. {15},The hours they made their taper fingers strike
8446,SCHOOLS. {15},"Note after note, all dull to them alike;"
8447,SCHOOLS. {15},"Their drawings, dancings on appointed days,"
8448,SCHOOLS. {15},"Playing with globes, and getting parts of plays:"
8449,SCHOOLS. {15},"The tender friendships made 'twixt heart and heart,"
8450,SCHOOLS. {15},When the dear friends had nothing to impart:  -
8451,SCHOOLS. {15},All! all! are over;--now th' accomplish'd maid
8452,SCHOOLS. {15},"Longs for the world, of nothing there afraid:"
8453,SCHOOLS. {15},"Dreams of delight invade her gentle breast,"
8454,SCHOOLS. {15},And fancied lovers rob the heart of rest;
8455,SCHOOLS. {15},"At the paternal door a carriage stands,"
8456,SCHOOLS. {15},Love knits their hearts and Hymen joins their hands.
8457,SCHOOLS. {15},"Ah! world unknown! how charming is thy view,"
8458,SCHOOLS. {15},"Thy pleasures many, and each pleasure new:"
8459,SCHOOLS. {15},Ah! world experienced! what of thee is told?
8460,SCHOOLS. {15},"How few thy pleasures, and those few how old!"
8461,SCHOOLS. {15},"Within a silent street, and far apart"
8462,SCHOOLS. {15},"From noise of business, from a quay or mart,"
8463,SCHOOLS. {15},"Stands an old spacious building, and the din"
8464,SCHOOLS. {15},"You hear without, explains the work within;"
8465,SCHOOLS. {15},"Unlike the whispering of the nymphs, this noise"
8466,SCHOOLS. {15},"Loudly proclaims a ""Boarding-School for Boys;"""
8467,SCHOOLS. {15},"The master heeds it not, for thirty years"
8468,SCHOOLS. {15},Have render'd all familiar to his ears;
8469,SCHOOLS. {15},"He sits in comfort, 'mid the various sound"
8470,SCHOOLS. {15},Of mingled tones for ever flowing round:
8471,SCHOOLS. {15},"Day after day he to his task attends, -"
8472,SCHOOLS. {15},"Unvaried toil, and care that never ends:"
8473,SCHOOLS. {15},Boys in their works proceed; while his employ
8474,SCHOOLS. {15},"Admits no change, or changes but the boy;"
8475,SCHOOLS. {15},Yet time has made it easy;--he beside
8476,SCHOOLS. {15},"Has power supreme, and power is sweet to pride:"
8477,SCHOOLS. {15},"But grant him pleasure; what can teachers feel,"
8478,SCHOOLS. {15},Dependent helpers always at the wheel?
8479,SCHOOLS. {15},"Their power despised, their compensation small,"
8480,SCHOOLS. {15},"Their labour dull, their life laborious all;"
8481,SCHOOLS. {15},Set after set the lower lads to make
8482,SCHOOLS. {15},Fit for the class which their superiors take;
8483,SCHOOLS. {15},The road of learning for a time to track
8484,SCHOOLS. {15},"In roughest state, and then again go back:"
8485,SCHOOLS. {15},"Just the same way, on other troops to wait, -"
8486,SCHOOLS. {15},Attendants fix'd at learning's lower gate.
8487,SCHOOLS. {15},The Day-tasks now are over--to their ground
8488,SCHOOLS. {15},Rush the gay crowd with joy-compelling sound;
8489,SCHOOLS. {15},"Glad to elude the burthens of the day,"
8490,SCHOOLS. {15},The eager parties hurry to their play:
8491,SCHOOLS. {15},Then in these hours of liberty we find
8492,SCHOOLS. {15},The native bias of the opening mind;
8493,SCHOOLS. {15},"They yet possess not skill the mask to place,"
8494,SCHOOLS. {15},And hide the passions glowing in the face;
8495,SCHOOLS. {15},"Yet some are found--the close, the sly, the mean,"
8496,SCHOOLS. {15},Who know already all must not be seen.
8497,SCHOOLS. {15},"Lo! one who walks apart, although so young,"
8498,SCHOOLS. {15},"He lays restraint upon his eye and tongue,"
8499,SCHOOLS. {15},"Nor will he into scrapes or dangers get,"
8500,SCHOOLS. {15},And half the school are in the stripling's debt:
8501,SCHOOLS. {15},"Suspicious, timid, he is much afraid"
8502,SCHOOLS. {15},Of trick and plot: --he dreads to be betray'd:
8503,SCHOOLS. {15},"He shuns all friendship, for he finds they lend"
8504,SCHOOLS. {15},When lads begin to call each other friend:
8505,SCHOOLS. {15},Yet self with self has war; the tempting sight
8506,SCHOOLS. {15},Of fruit on sale provokes his appetite; -
8507,SCHOOLS. {15},See! how he walks the sweet seduction by;
8508,SCHOOLS. {15},"That he is tempted, costs him first a sigh, -"
8509,SCHOOLS. {15},"'Tis dangerous to indulge, 'tis grievous to deny!"
8510,SCHOOLS. {15},"This he will choose, and whispering asks the price,"
8511,SCHOOLS. {15},"The purchase dreadful, but the portion nice:"
8512,SCHOOLS. {15},Within the pocket he explores the pence;
8513,SCHOOLS. {15},"Without, temptation strikes on either sense,"
8514,SCHOOLS. {15},"The sight, the smell;--but then he thinks again"
8515,SCHOOLS. {15},Of money gone! while fruit nor taste remain.
8516,SCHOOLS. {15},"Meantime there comes an eager thoughtless boy,"
8517,SCHOOLS. {15},Who gives the price and only feels the joy:
8518,SCHOOLS. {15},Example dire:  the youthful miser stops
8519,SCHOOLS. {15},And slowly back the treasured coinage drops:
8520,SCHOOLS. {15},"Heroic deed! for should he now comply,"
8521,SCHOOLS. {15},Can he tomorrow's appetite deny?
8522,SCHOOLS. {15},"Beside, these spendthrifts who so freely live,"
8523,SCHOOLS. {15},"Cloy'd with their purchase, will a portion give:  -"
8524,SCHOOLS. {15},"Here ends debate, he buttons up his store,"
8525,SCHOOLS. {15},And feels the comfort that it burns no more.
8526,SCHOOLS. {15},"Unlike to him the Tyrant-boy, whose sway"
8527,SCHOOLS. {15},All hearts acknowledge; him the crowds obey:
8528,SCHOOLS. {15},At his command they break through every rule;
8529,SCHOOLS. {15},"Whoever governs, he controls the school:"
8530,SCHOOLS. {15},"'Tis not the distant emperor moves their fear,"
8531,SCHOOLS. {15},But the proud viceroy who is ever near.
8532,SCHOOLS. {15},"Verres could do that mischief in a day,"
8533,SCHOOLS. {15},"For which not Rome, in all its power, could pay;"
8534,SCHOOLS. {15},"And these boy-tyrants will their slaves distress,"
8535,SCHOOLS. {15},And do the wrongs no master can redress:
8536,SCHOOLS. {15},The mind they load with fear; it feels disdain
8537,SCHOOLS. {15},For its own baseness; yet it tries in vain
8538,SCHOOLS. {15},To shake th' admitted power: --the coward comes again:
8539,SCHOOLS. {15},"'Tis more than present pain these tyrants give,"
8540,SCHOOLS. {15},Long as we've life some strong impressions live;
8541,SCHOOLS. {15},And these young ruffians in the soul will sow
8542,SCHOOLS. {15},Seeds of all vices that on weakness grow.
8543,SCHOOLS. {15},"Hark! at his word the trembling younglings flee,"
8544,SCHOOLS. {15},Where he is walking none must walk but he;
8545,SCHOOLS. {15},"See! from the winter fire the weak retreat,"
8546,SCHOOLS. {15},"His the warm corner, his the favourite seat,"
8547,SCHOOLS. {15},Save when he yields it to some slave to keep
8548,SCHOOLS. {15},"Awhile, then back, at his return, to creep:"
8549,SCHOOLS. {15},"At his command his poor dependants fly,"
8550,SCHOOLS. {15},And humbly bribe him as a proud ally;
8551,SCHOOLS. {15},"Flatter'd by all, the notice he bestows,"
8552,SCHOOLS. {15},"Is gross abuse, and bantering and blows;"
8553,SCHOOLS. {15},"Yet he's a dunce, and, spite of all his fame"
8554,SCHOOLS. {15},"Without the desk, within he feels his shame:"
8555,SCHOOLS. {15},"For there the weaker boy, who felt his scorn,"
8556,SCHOOLS. {15},For him corrects the blunders of the morn;
8557,SCHOOLS. {15},"And he is taught, unpleasant truth! to find"
8558,SCHOOLS. {15},The trembling body has the prouder mind.
8559,SCHOOLS. {15},"Hark! to that shout, that burst of empty noise,"
8560,SCHOOLS. {15},"From a rude set of bluff, obstreperous boys;"
8561,SCHOOLS. {15},"They who, like colts let loose, with vigour bound,"
8562,SCHOOLS. {15},"And thoughtless spirit, o'er the beaten ground;"
8563,SCHOOLS. {15},"Fearless they leap, and every youngster feels"
8564,SCHOOLS. {15},His Alma active in his hands and heels.
8565,SCHOOLS. {15},"These are the sons of farmers, and they come"
8566,SCHOOLS. {15},With partial fondness for the joys of home;
8567,SCHOOLS. {15},"Their minds are coursing in their fathers' fields,"
8568,SCHOOLS. {15},And e'en the dream a lively pleasure yields;

8716,SCHOOLS. {15},"a stranger in the Borough, it may be necessary to make some apology"
8717,SCHOOLS. {15},for his appearance in the Poem.  Previous to a late meeting of a
8718,SCHOOLS. {15},"literary society, whose benevolent purpose is well known to the"
8719,SCHOOLS. {15},"public, I was induced by a friend to compose a few verses, in which,"
8720,SCHOOLS. {15},"with the general commendation of the design, should be introduced a"
8721,SCHOOLS. {15},"hint that the bounty might be farther extended; these verses, a"
8722,SCHOOLS. {15},"gentleman did me the honour to recite at the meeting, and they were"
8723,SCHOOLS. {15},"printed as an extract from the Poem, to which, in fact, they may be"
8724,SCHOOLS. {15},called an appendage.

8734,SCHOOLS. {15},nor any design in the other to treat with contempt the resources of
8735,SCHOOLS. {15},the poor.  The good-humour is considered as the consolation of
8736,SCHOOLS. {15},disappointment; and the room is so mentioned because the lodger is
8737,SCHOOLS. {15},vain.  Most of my readers will perceive this:  but I shall be sorry

8741,SCHOOLS. {15},{5}  The Letter on Itinerant Players will to some appear too harshly
8742,SCHOOLS. {15},"written, their profligacy exaggerated, and their distresses"
8743,SCHOOLS. {15},magnified; but though the respectability of a part of these people
8744,SCHOOLS. {15},may give us a more favourable view of the whole body; though some
8745,SCHOOLS. {15},"actors be sober, and some managers prudent; still there is vice and"
8746,SCHOOLS. {15},"misery left more than sufficient to justify my description.  But, if"
8747,SCHOOLS. {15},I could find only one woman who (passing forty years on many stages
8748,SCHOOLS. {15},and sustaining many principal characters) laments in her unrespected
8749,SCHOOLS. {15},"old age, that there was no workhouse to which she could legally sue"
8750,SCHOOLS. {15},"for admission; if I could produce only one female, seduced upon the"
8751,SCHOOLS. {15},"boards, and starved in her lodging, compelled by her poverty to"
8752,SCHOOLS. {15},"sing, and by her sufferings to weep, without any prospect but"
8753,SCHOOLS. {15},"misery, or any consolation but death; if I could exhibit only one"
8754,SCHOOLS. {15},youth who sought refuge from parental authority in the licentious
8755,SCHOOLS. {15},"freedom of a wandering company; yet, with three such examples, I"
8756,SCHOOLS. {15},should feel myself justified in the account I have given: --but such
8757,SCHOOLS. {15},"characters and sufferings are common, and there are few of these"
8758,SCHOOLS. {15},societies which could not show members of this description.  To
8759,SCHOOLS. {15},"some, indeed, the life has its satisfactions:  they never expected"
8760,SCHOOLS. {15},"to be free from labour, and their present kind they think is light:"
8761,SCHOOLS. {15},"they have no delicate ideas of shame, and therefore duns and hisses"
8762,SCHOOLS. {15},give them no other pain than what arises from the fear of not being
8763,SCHOOLS. {15},"trusted, joined with the apprehension that they may have nothing to"

8772,SCHOOLS. {15},"but then it is most uncertain whether he would ever appear, and he"

8785,SCHOOLS. {15},"find a difference in the versification or expression, he will be"
8786,SCHOOLS. {15},thus enabled to account for it.

8788,SCHOOLS. {15},"{9}  The Poor are here almost of necessity introduced, for they must"
8789,SCHOOLS. {15},"be considered, in every place, as a large and interesting portion of"
8790,SCHOOLS. {15},its inhabitants.  I am aware of the great difficulty of acquiring
8791,SCHOOLS. {15},just notions on the maintenance and management of this class of our
8792,SCHOOLS. {15},"fellow subjects, and I forbear to express any opinion of the various"
8793,SCHOOLS. {15},modes which have been discussed or adopted:  of one method only I
8794,SCHOOLS. {15},"venture to give my sentiments,--that of collecting the poor of a"
8795,SCHOOLS. {15},hundred into one building.  This admission of a vast number of
8796,SCHOOLS. {15},"persons, of all ages and both sexes, of very different inclinations,"
8797,SCHOOLS. {15},"habits, and capacities, into a society, must, at a first view I"
8798,SCHOOLS. {15},"conceive, be looked upon as a cause of both vice and misery; nor"
8799,SCHOOLS. {15},does anything which I have heard or read invalidate the opinion:
8800,SCHOOLS. {15},"happily, the method is not a prevailing one, as these houses are, I"
8801,SCHOOLS. {15},"believe, still confined to that part of the kingdom where they"
8802,SCHOOLS. {15},originated.
8803,SCHOOLS. {15},
8804,SCHOOLS. {15},"{10}  John Bunyan, in one of the many productions of his zeal, has"
8805,SCHOOLS. {15},"ventured to make public this extraordinary sentiment, which the"
8806,SCHOOLS. {15},frigid piety of our Clerk so readily adopted.
8807,SCHOOLS. {15},
8808,SCHOOLS. {15},"{11}  The Life of Ellen Orford, though sufficiently burdened with"
8809,SCHOOLS. {15},"error and misfortune, has in it little besides which resembles those"
8810,SCHOOLS. {15},"of the unhappy men in the preceding Letters, and is still more"
8811,SCHOOLS. {15},"unlike that of Grimes, in a subsequent one.  There is in this"
8812,SCHOOLS. {15},"character cheerfulness and resignation, a more uniform piety, and an"
8813,SCHOOLS. {15},"immovable trust in the aid of religion.  This, with the light"
8814,SCHOOLS. {15},"texture of the introductory part, will, I hope, take off from that"
8815,SCHOOLS. {15},idea of sameness which the repetition of crimes and distresses is
8816,SCHOOLS. {15},likely to create.
8817,SCHOOLS. {15},
8818,SCHOOLS. {15},{12}  It has been a subject of greater vexation to me than such
8819,SCHOOLS. {15},"trifle ought to be, that I could not, without destroying all"
8820,SCHOOLS. {15},"appearance of arrangement, separate these melancholy narratives, and"
8821,SCHOOLS. {15},place the fallen Clerk in Office at a greater distance from the
8822,SCHOOLS. {15},"Clerk of the Parish, especially as they resembled each other in"
8823,SCHOOLS. {15},"several particulars; both being tempted, seduced, and wretched.  Yet"
8824,SCHOOLS. {15},"there are, I conceive, considerable marks of distinction:  their"
8825,SCHOOLS. {15},guilt is of different kind; nor would either have committed the
8826,SCHOOLS. {15},offence of the other.  The Clerk of the Parish could break the
8827,SCHOOLS. {15},"commandment, but he could not have been induced to have disowned an"
8828,SCHOOLS. {15},"article of that creed for which he had so bravely contended, and on"
8829,SCHOOLS. {15},which he fully relied; and the upright mind of the Clerk in Office
8830,SCHOOLS. {15},"would have secured him from being guilty of wrong and robbery,"
8831,SCHOOLS. {15},though his weak and vacillating intellect could not preserve him
8832,SCHOOLS. {15},"from infidelity and profaneness.  Their melancholy is nearly alike,"
8833,SCHOOLS. {15},"but not its consequences.  Jachin retained hia belief, and though he"
8834,SCHOOLS. {15},"hated life, he could never be induced to quit it voluntarily; but"
8835,SCHOOLS. {15},Abel was driven to terminate his misery in a way which the
8836,SCHOOLS. {15},unfixedness of his religious opinions rather accelerated than
8837,SCHOOLS. {15},"retarded.  I am, therefore, not without hope, that the more"
8838,SCHOOLS. {15},observant of my readers will perceive many marks of discrimination
8839,SCHOOLS. {15},in these characters.
8840,SCHOOLS. {15},
8841,SCHOOLS. {15},"{13}  The character of Grimes, his obduracy and apparent want of"
8842,SCHOOLS. {15},"feeling, his gloomy kind of misanthropy, the progress of his"
8843,SCHOOLS. {15},"madness, and the horrors of his imagination, I must leave to the"
8844,SCHOOLS. {15},judgment and observation of my readers.  The mind here exhibited is
8845,SCHOOLS. {15},"one untouched by pity, unstung by remorse, and uncorrected by shame;"
8846,SCHOOLS. {15},"yet is this hardihood of temper and spirit broken by want, disease,"
8847,SCHOOLS. {15},"solitude, and disappointment:  and he becomes the victim of a"
8848,SCHOOLS. {15},"distempered and horror-stricken fancy.  It is evident, therefore,"
8849,SCHOOLS. {15},"that no feeble vision, no half-visible ghost, not the momentary"
8850,SCHOOLS. {15},"glance of an unbodied being, nor the half-audible voice of an"
8851,SCHOOLS. {15},"invisible one, would be created by the continual workings of"
8852,SCHOOLS. {15},distress on a mind so depraved and flinty.  The ruffian of Mr Scott
8853,SCHOOLS. {15},"(Marmion) has a mind of this nature; he has no shame or remorse, but"
8854,SCHOOLS. {15},"the corrosion of hopeless want, the wasting of unabating disease,"
8855,SCHOOLS. {15},"and the gloom of unvaried solitude, will have their effect on every"
8856,SCHOOLS. {15},"nature and the harder that nature is, and the longer time required"
8857,SCHOOLS. {15},"to work upon it, so much the more strong and indelible is the"
8858,SCHOOLS. {15},"impression.  This is all the reason I am able to give, why a man of"
8859,SCHOOLS. {15},"feeling so dull should yet become insane, and why the visions of his"
8860,SCHOOLS. {15},distempered brain should be of so horrible a nature.
8861,SCHOOLS. {15},
8862,SCHOOLS. {15},{14}  That a Letter on Prisons should follow the narratives of such
8863,SCHOOLS. {15},"characters as Keene and Grimes is unfortunate, but not to be easily"
8864,SCHOOLS. {15},avoided.  I confess it is not pleasant to be detained so long by
8865,SCHOOLS. {15},subiects so repulsive to the feelings of many as the sufferings of
8866,SCHOOLS. {15},"mankind; but, though I assuredly would have altered this"
8867,SCHOOLS. {15},"arrangement, had I been able to have done it by substituting a"
8868,SCHOOLS. {15},"better, yet am I not of opinion that my verses, or, indeed, the"
8869,SCHOOLS. {15},"verses of any other person,"
8870,SCHOOLS. {15},can so represent the evils and distresses of life as to make any
8871,SCHOOLS. {15},"material impression on the mind, and much less any of injurious"
8872,SCHOOLS. {15},"nature.  Alas! sufferings real, evident, continually before us, have"
8873,SCHOOLS. {15},"not effects very serious or lasting, even in the minds of the more"
8874,SCHOOLS. {15},"reflecting and compassionate; nor, indeed, does it seem right that"
8875,SCHOOLS. {15},the pain caused by sympathy should serve for more than a stimulus to
8876,SCHOOLS. {15},benevolence.  If then the strength and solidity of truth placed
8877,SCHOOLS. {15},"before our eyes have effect so feeble and transitory, I need not be"
8878,SCHOOLS. {15},very apprehensive that my representations of Poor-houses and
8879,SCHOOLS. {15},"Prisons, of wants and sufferings, however faithfully taken, will"
8880,SCHOOLS. {15},excite any feelings which can be seriously lamented.  It has always
8881,SCHOOLS. {15},been held as a salutary exercise of the mind to contemplate the
8882,SCHOOLS. {15},evils and miseries of our nature:  I am not therefore without hope
8883,SCHOOLS. {15},"that even this gloomy subject of Imprisonment, and more especially"
8884,SCHOOLS. {15},"the Dream of the Condemned Highwayman, will excite in some minds"
8885,SCHOOLS. {15},"that mingled pity and abhorrence which, while it is not"
8886,SCHOOLS. {15},"unpleasant to the feelings, is useful in its operation.  It ties and"
8887,SCHOOLS. {15},"binds us to all mankind by sensations common to us all, and in some"
8888,SCHOOLS. {15},"degree connects us, without degradation, even to the most miserable"
8889,SCHOOLS. {15},and guilty of our fellow-men.
8890,SCHOOLS. {15},
8891,SCHOOLS. {15},{15}  Our concluding subject is Education; and some attempt is made
8892,SCHOOLS. {15},"to describe its various seminaries, from that of the poor widow who"
8893,SCHOOLS. {15},"pronounces the alphabet for infants, to seats whence the light of"
8894,SCHOOLS. {15},"learning is shed abroad on the world.  If, in this Letter, I"
8895,SCHOOLS. {15},describe the lives of literary men as embittered by much evil; if
8896,SCHOOLS. {15},"they be often disappointed, and sometimes unfitted for the world"
8897,SCHOOLS. {15},they improve; let it be considered that they are described as men
8898,SCHOOLS. {15},"who possess that great pleasure, the exercise of their own talents,"
8899,SCHOOLS. {15},and the delight which flows from their own exertions:  they have joy
8900,SCHOOLS. {15},"in their pursuits, and glory in their acquirements of knowledge."
8901,SCHOOLS. {15},Their victory over difficulties affords the most rational cause of
8902,SCHOOLS. {15},"triumph, and the attainment of new ideas leads to incalculable"
8903,SCHOOLS. {15},"riches, such as gratify the glorious avarice of aspiring and"
8904,SCHOOLS. {15},"comprehensive minds.  Here, then, I place the reward of Learning."
8905,SCHOOLS. {15},"Our Universities produce men of the first scholastic attainments,"
8906,SCHOOLS. {15},"who are heirs to large possessions, or descendants from noble"
8907,SCHOOLS. {15},"families.  Now, to those so favoured, talents and acquirements are"
8908,SCHOOLS. {15},unquestionably means of arriving at the most elevated and important
8909,SCHOOLS. {15},"situations; but these must be the lot of a few:  in general, the"
8910,SCHOOLS. {15},"diligence, acuteness, and perseverance of a youth at the University,"
8911,SCHOOLS. {15},"have no other reward than some college honours and emoluments, which"
8912,SCHOOLS. {15},"they desire to exchange, many of them, for very moderate incomes in"
8913,SCHOOLS. {15},"the obscurity of some distant village; so that, in stating the"
8914,SCHOOLS. {15},reward of an ardent and powerful mind to consist principally (I
8915,SCHOOLS. {15},"might have said entirely) in its own views, efforts, and excursions,"
8916,SCHOOLS. {15},I place it upon a
8917,SCHOOLS. {15},"sure foundation, though not one so elevated as the more ambitious"
8918,SCHOOLS. {15},aspire to.  It is surely some encouragement to a studious man to
8919,SCHOOLS. {15},"reflect that, if he be disappointed, he cannot be without"
8920,SCHOOLS. {15},"gratification; and that, if he gets but a very humble portion of"
8921,SCHOOLS. {15},"what the world can give, he has a continual fruition of unwearying"
8922,SCHOOLS. {15},"enjoyment, of which it has not power to deprive him."
