201,ROSAMUND.,
202,ROSAMUND.,
203,ROSAMUND.,"_His blew His winds, and they were scattered._"
204,ROSAMUND.,
205,ROSAMUND.,'One soweth and another reapeth.'
206,ROSAMUND.,"Ay,"
207,ROSAMUND.,"Too true, too true. One soweth--unaware"
208,ROSAMUND.,Cometh a reaper stealthily while he dreams--
209,ROSAMUND.,"Bindeth the golden sheaf, and in his bosom"
210,ROSAMUND.,As 't were between the dewfall and the dawn
211,ROSAMUND.,Bears it away. Who other was to blame?
212,ROSAMUND.,"Is it I? Is it I?--No verily, not I,"
213,ROSAMUND.,"'T was a good action, and I smart therefore;"
214,ROSAMUND.,Oblivion of a righteous enmity
215,ROSAMUND.,Wrought me this wrong. I pay with my self ruth
216,ROSAMUND.,That I had ruth toward mine enemy;
217,ROSAMUND.,"It needed not to slay mine enemy,"
218,ROSAMUND.,Only to let him lie and succourless
219,ROSAMUND.,Drift to the foot o' the Everlasting Throne;
220,ROSAMUND.,"Being mine enemy, he had not accused"
221,ROSAMUND.,One of my nation there of unkind deeds
222,ROSAMUND.,Or ought the way of war forbids.
223,ROSAMUND.,Let be!
224,ROSAMUND.,I will not think upon it. Yet she was--
225,ROSAMUND.,"O, she was dear; my dutiful, dear child."
226,ROSAMUND.,"One soweth--Nay, but I will tell this out,"
227,ROSAMUND.,"The first fyte was the best, I call it such"
228,ROSAMUND.,For now as some old song men think on it.
229,ROSAMUND.,
230,ROSAMUND.,I dwell where England narrows running north;
231,ROSAMUND.,And while our hay was cut came rumours up
232,ROSAMUND.,Humming and swarming round our heads like bees:
233,ROSAMUND.,
234,ROSAMUND.,"'Drake from the bay of Cadiz hath come home,"
235,ROSAMUND.,"And they are forth, the Spaniards with a force"
236,ROSAMUND.,Invincible.'
237,ROSAMUND.,"'The Prince of Parma, couched"
238,ROSAMUND.,"At Dunkirk, e'en by torchlight makes to toil"
239,ROSAMUND.,His shipwright thousands--thousands in the ports
240,ROSAMUND.,Of Flanders and Brabant. An hundred hendes
241,ROSAMUND.,"Transports to his great squadron adding, all"
242,ROSAMUND.,For our confusion.'
243,ROSAMUND.,'England's great ally
244,ROSAMUND.,"Henry of France, by insurrection fallen,"
245,ROSAMUND.,"Of him the said Prince Parma mocking cries,"
246,ROSAMUND.,He shall not help the Queen of England now
247,ROSAMUND.,"Not even with his tears, more needing them"
248,ROSAMUND.,To weep his own misfortune.'
249,ROSAMUND.,Was that all
250,ROSAMUND.,"The truth? Not half, and yet it was enough"
251,ROSAMUND.,"(Albeit not half that half was well believed),"
252,ROSAMUND.,For all the land stirred in the half belief
253,ROSAMUND.,As dreamers stir about to wake; and now
254,ROSAMUND.,"Comes the Queen's message, all her lieges bid"
255,ROSAMUND.,"To rise, 'lieftenants, and the better sort"
256,ROSAMUND.,"Of gentlemen' whereby the Queen's grace meant,"
257,ROSAMUND.,As it may seem the sort that willed to rise
258,ROSAMUND.,"And arm, and come to aid her."
259,ROSAMUND.,Distance wrought
260,ROSAMUND.,"Safety for us, my neighbours and near friends,"
261,ROSAMUND.,The peril lay along our channel coast
262,ROSAMUND.,"And marked the city, undefended fair"
263,ROSAMUND.,Rich London. O to think of Spanish mail
264,ROSAMUND.,"Ringing--of riotous conquerors in her street,"
265,ROSAMUND.,Chasing and frighting (would there were no more
266,ROSAMUND.,To think on) her fair wives and her fair maids.
267,ROSAMUND.,--But hope is fain to deem them forth of her.
268,ROSAMUND.,
269,ROSAMUND.,Then Spain to the sacking; then they tear away
270,ROSAMUND.,Arras and carvèd work. O then they break
271,ROSAMUND.,"And toss, and mar her quaint orfèverie"
272,ROSAMUND.,"Priceless--then split the wine kegs, spill the mead,"
273,ROSAMUND.,Trail out the pride of ages in the dust;
274,ROSAMUND.,"Turn over with pikes her silken merchandise,"
275,ROSAMUND.,"Strip off the pictures of her kings, and spoil"
276,ROSAMUND.,Their palaces that nigh five hundred years
277,ROSAMUND.,"Have rued no alien footsteps on the floor,"
278,ROSAMUND.,And work--for the days of miracle are gone--
279,ROSAMUND.,All unimaginable waste and woe.
280,ROSAMUND.,
281,ROSAMUND.,"Some cried, 'But England hath the better cause;"
282,ROSAMUND.,We think not those good days indeed are done;
283,ROSAMUND.,We look to Heaven for aid on England's side.'
284,ROSAMUND.,"Then other, 'Nay, the harvest is above,"
285,ROSAMUND.,"God comforts there His own, and ill men leaves"
286,ROSAMUND.,"To run long scores up in this present world,"
287,ROSAMUND.,And pay in another.
288,ROSAMUND.,Look not here for aid.
289,ROSAMUND.,"Latimer, poor old saint, died in the street"
290,ROSAMUND.,"With nigh, men say, three hundred of his kind,"
291,ROSAMUND.,"All bid to look for worse death after death,"
292,ROSAMUND.,"Succourless, comfortless, unfriended, curst."
293,ROSAMUND.,"Mary, and Gardiner, and the Pope's man Pole"
294,ROSAMUND.,"Died upon down, lulled in a silken shade,"
295,ROSAMUND.,"Soothed with assurance of a waiting heaven,"
296,ROSAMUND.,"And Peter peering through the golden gate,"
297,ROSAMUND.,With his gold key in 's hand to let them in.'
298,ROSAMUND.,
299,ROSAMUND.,"'Nay, leave,' quoth I, 'the martyrs to their heaven,"
300,ROSAMUND.,And all who live the better that they died.
301,ROSAMUND.,"But look you now, a nation hath no heaven,"
302,ROSAMUND.,A nation's life and work and wickedness
303,ROSAMUND.,"And punishment--or otherwise, I say"
304,ROSAMUND.,A nation's life and goodness and reward
305,ROSAMUND.,Are here. And in my nation's righteous cause
306,ROSAMUND.,"I look for aid, and cry, SO HELP ME GOD"
307,ROSAMUND.,As I will help my righteous nation now
308,ROSAMUND.,"With all the best I have, and know, and am,"
309,ROSAMUND.,I trust Thou wilt not let her light be quenched;
310,ROSAMUND.,"I go to aid, and if I fall--I fall,"
311,ROSAMUND.,"And, God of nations, leave my soul to Thee.'"
312,ROSAMUND.,
313,ROSAMUND.,"Many did say like words, and all would give"
314,ROSAMUND.,"Of gold, of weapons, and of horses that"
315,ROSAMUND.,They had to hand or on the spur o' the time
316,ROSAMUND.,"Could gather. My fair dame did sell her rings,"
317,ROSAMUND.,So others. And they sent us well equipped
318,ROSAMUND.,Who minded to be in the coming fray
319,ROSAMUND.,"Whether by land or sea; my hope the last,"
320,ROSAMUND.,For I of old therewith was conversant.
321,ROSAMUND.,
322,ROSAMUND.,Then as we rode down southward all the land
323,ROSAMUND.,Was at her harvesting. The oats were cut
324,ROSAMUND.,"Ere we were three days down, and then the wheat,"
325,ROSAMUND.,And the wide country spite of loathèd threat
326,ROSAMUND.,Was busy. There was news to hearten us:
327,ROSAMUND.,The Hollanders were coming roundly in
328,ROSAMUND.,"With sixty ships of war, all fierce, and full"
329,ROSAMUND.,"Of spleen, for not alone our sake but theirs"
330,ROSAMUND.,Willing to brave encounter where they might.
331,ROSAMUND.,
332,ROSAMUND.,"So after five days we did sight the Sound,"
333,ROSAMUND.,And look on Plymouth harbour from the hill.
334,ROSAMUND.,"Then I full glad drew bridle, lighted straight,"
335,ROSAMUND.,Ran down and mingled with a waiting crowd.
336,ROSAMUND.,
337,ROSAMUND.,Many stood gazing on the level deep
338,ROSAMUND.,That scarce did tremble; 't was in hue as sloes
339,ROSAMUND.,"That hang till winter on a leafless bough,"
340,ROSAMUND.,So black bulged down upon it a great cloud
341,ROSAMUND.,And probed it through and through with forkèd stabs
342,ROSAMUND.,"Incessant, and rolled on it thunder bursts"
343,ROSAMUND.,Till the dark water lowered as one afraid.
344,ROSAMUND.,
345,ROSAMUND.,That was afar. The land and nearer sea
346,ROSAMUND.,Lay sweltering in hot sunshine. The brown beach
347,ROSAMUND.,"Scarce whispered, for a soft incoming tide"
348,ROSAMUND.,Was gentle with it. Green the water lapped
349,ROSAMUND.,And sparkled at all edges. The night-heavens
350,ROSAMUND.,Are not more thickly speckled o'er with stars
351,ROSAMUND.,Than that fair harbour with its fishing craft.
352,ROSAMUND.,And crowds of galleys shooting to and fro
353,ROSAMUND.,"Did feed the ships of war with their stout crews,"
354,ROSAMUND.,"And bear aboard fresh water, furniture"
355,ROSAMUND.,"Of war, much lesser victual, sallets, fruit,"
356,ROSAMUND.,"All manner equipment for the squadron, sails,"
357,ROSAMUND.,Long spars.
358,ROSAMUND.,"Also was chaffering on the Hoe,"
359,ROSAMUND.,"Buying and bargaining, taking of leave"
360,ROSAMUND.,"With tears and kisses, while on all hands pushed"
361,ROSAMUND.,Tall lusty men with baskets on their heads
362,ROSAMUND.,"Piled of fresh bread, and biscuit newly drawn."
363,ROSAMUND.,
364,ROSAMUND.,"Then shouts, 'The captains!'"
365,ROSAMUND.,"Raleigh, Hawkins, Drake,"
366,ROSAMUND.,"Old Martin Frobisher, and many more;"
367,ROSAMUND.,"Howard, the Lord High Admiral, headed them--"
368,ROSAMUND.,"They coming leisurely from the bowling green,"
369,ROSAMUND.,Elbowed their way. For in their stoutness loth
370,ROSAMUND.,"To hurry when ill news first brake on them,"
371,ROSAMUND.,"They playing a match ashore--ill news I say,"
372,ROSAMUND.,'The Spaniards are toward'--while panic-struck
373,ROSAMUND.,"The people ran about them, Drake cries out,"
374,ROSAMUND.,"Knowing their fear should make the danger worse,"
375,ROSAMUND.,"'Spaniards, my masters! Let the Spaniards wait."
376,ROSAMUND.,Fall not a-shouting for the boats; is time
377,ROSAMUND.,"To play the match out, ay to win, and then"
378,ROSAMUND.,To beat the Spaniards.'
379,ROSAMUND.,So the rest gave way
380,ROSAMUND.,"At his insistance, playing that afternoon"
381,ROSAMUND.,The bravest match (one saith) was ever scored.
382,ROSAMUND.,
383,ROSAMUND.,"'T was no time lost; nay, not a moment lost;"
384,ROSAMUND.,"For look you, when the winning cast was made,"
385,ROSAMUND.,"The town was calm, the anchors were all up,"
386,ROSAMUND.,"The boats were manned to row them each to his ship,"
387,ROSAMUND.,The lowering cloud in the offing had gone south
388,ROSAMUND.,"Against the wind, and all was work, stir, heed,"
389,ROSAMUND.,"Nothing forgot, nor grudged, nor slurred, and most"
390,ROSAMUND.,Men easy at heart as those brave sailors seemed.
391,ROSAMUND.,
392,ROSAMUND.,And specially the women had put by
393,ROSAMUND.,On a sudden their deep dread; yon Cornish coast
394,ROSAMUND.,"Neared of his insolency by the foe,"
395,ROSAMUND.,"With his high seacastles numerous, seaforts"
396,ROSAMUND.,"Many, his galleys out of number, manned"
397,ROSAMUND.,Each by three hundred slaves chained to the oar;
398,ROSAMUND.,"All his strong fleet of lesser ships, but great"
399,ROSAMUND.,As any of ours--why that same Cornish coast
400,ROSAMUND.,"Might have lain farther than the far west land,"
401,ROSAMUND.,So had a few stout-hearted looks and words
402,ROSAMUND.,"Wasted the meaning, chilled the menace of"
403,ROSAMUND.,"That frightful danger, imminent, hard at hand."
404,ROSAMUND.,
405,ROSAMUND.,"'The captains come, the captains!' and I turned"
406,ROSAMUND.,As they drew on. I marked the urgency
407,ROSAMUND.,Flashing in each man's eye: fain to be forth
408,ROSAMUND.,But willing to be held at leisure. Then
409,ROSAMUND.,Cried a fair woman of the better sort
410,ROSAMUND.,"To Howard, passing by her pannier'd ass,"
411,ROSAMUND.,"'Apples, Lord Admiral, good captains all,"
412,ROSAMUND.,"Look you, red apples sharp and sweet are these,'"
413,ROSAMUND.,
414,ROSAMUND.,"Quoth he a little chafed, 'Let be, let be,"
415,ROSAMUND.,"No time is this for bargaining, good dame."
416,ROSAMUND.,"Let be;' and pushing past, 'Beshrew thy heart"
417,ROSAMUND.,"(And mine that I should say it), bargain! nay."
418,ROSAMUND.,"I meant not bargaining,' she falters; crying,"
419,ROSAMUND.,"'I brought them my poor gift. Pray you now take,"
420,ROSAMUND.,Pray you.'
421,ROSAMUND.,"He stops, and with a childlike smile"
422,ROSAMUND.,"That makes the dame amend, stoops down to choose,"
423,ROSAMUND.,"While I step up that love not many words,"
424,ROSAMUND.,"'What should he do,' quoth I, 'to help this need"
425,ROSAMUND.,"That hath a bag of money, and good will?'"
426,ROSAMUND.,"'Charter a ship,' he saith, nor e'er looks up,"
427,ROSAMUND.,"'And put aboard her victual, tackle, shot,"
428,ROSAMUND.,Ought he can lay his hand on--look he give
429,ROSAMUND.,"Wide sea room to the Spanish hounds, make sail"
430,ROSAMUND.,"For ships of ours, to ease of wounded men,"
431,ROSAMUND.,And succour with that freight he brings withal.'
432,ROSAMUND.,
433,ROSAMUND.,"His foot, yet speaking, was aboard his boat,"
434,ROSAMUND.,"His comrades, each red apples in the hand,"
435,ROSAMUND.,"Come after, and with blessings manifold"
436,ROSAMUND.,"Cheering, and cries, 'Good luck, good luck!' they speed."
437,ROSAMUND.,
438,ROSAMUND.,'T was three years three months past.
439,ROSAMUND.,O yet methinks
440,ROSAMUND.,I hear that thunder crash i' the offing; hear
441,ROSAMUND.,Their words who when the crowd melted away
442,ROSAMUND.,"Gathered together. Comrades we of old,"
443,ROSAMUND.,About to adventure us at Howard's best
444,ROSAMUND.,"On the unsafe sea. For he, a Catholic,"
445,ROSAMUND.,"As is my wife, and therefore my one child,"
446,ROSAMUND.,Detested and defied th' most Catholic King
447,ROSAMUND.,"Philip. He, trusted of her grace--and cause"
448,ROSAMUND.,"She had, the nation following suit--he deemed,"
449,ROSAMUND.,"'T was whisper'd, ay and Raleigh, and Francis Drake"
450,ROSAMUND.,"No less, the event of battle doubtfuller"
451,ROSAMUND.,Than English tongue might own; the peril dread
452,ROSAMUND.,As ought in this world ever can be deemed
453,ROSAMUND.,That is not yet past praying for.
454,ROSAMUND.,So far
455,ROSAMUND.,So good. As birds awaked do stretch their wings
456,ROSAMUND.,"The ships did stretch forth sail, full clad they towered"
457,ROSAMUND.,"And right into the sunset went, hull down"
458,ROSAMUND.,E'en with the sun.
459,ROSAMUND.,"To us in twilight left,"
460,ROSAMUND.,"Glory being over, came despondent thought"
461,ROSAMUND.,"That mocked men's eager act. From many a hill,"
462,ROSAMUND.,"As if the land complained to Heaven, they sent"
463,ROSAMUND.,"A towering shaft of murky incense high,"
464,ROSAMUND.,Livid with black despair in lieu of praise.
465,ROSAMUND.,The green wood hissed at every beacon's edge
466,ROSAMUND.,That widen'd fear. The smell of pitchpots fled
467,ROSAMUND.,"Far over the field, and tongues of fire leaped up,"
468,ROSAMUND.,"Ay, till all England woke, and knew, and wailed."
469,ROSAMUND.,
470,ROSAMUND.,But we i' the night through that detested reek
471,ROSAMUND.,Rode eastward. Every mariner's voice was given
472,ROSAMUND.,'Gainst any fear for the western shires. The cry
473,ROSAMUND.,"Was all, 'They sail for Calais roads, and thence,"
474,ROSAMUND.,The goal is London.'
475,ROSAMUND.,"Nought slept, man nor beast."
476,ROSAMUND.,"Ravens and rooks flew forth, and with black wings,"
477,ROSAMUND.,"Affrighted, swept our eyes. Pale eddying moths"
478,ROSAMUND.,Came by in crowds and whirled them on the flames.
479,ROSAMUND.,
480,ROSAMUND.,We rode till pierced those beacon fires the shafts
481,ROSAMUND.,"O' the sun, and their red smouldering ashes dulled."
482,ROSAMUND.,"Beside them, scorched, smoke-blackened, weary, leaned"
483,ROSAMUND.,"Men that had fed them, dropped their tired arms"
484,ROSAMUND.,And dozed.
485,ROSAMUND.,"And also through that day we rode,"
486,ROSAMUND.,Till reapers at their nooning sat awhile
487,ROSAMUND.,On the shady side of corn-shocks: all the talk
488,ROSAMUND.,"Of high, of low, or them that went or stayed"
489,ROSAMUND.,Determined but unhopeful; desperate
490,ROSAMUND.,To strike a blow for England ere she fell.
491,ROSAMUND.,
492,ROSAMUND.,"And ever loomed the Spaniard to our thought,"
493,ROSAMUND.,Still waxed the fame of that great Armament--
494,ROSAMUND.,"New horsemen joining, swelled it more and more--"
495,ROSAMUND.,"Their bulky ship galleons having five decks,"
496,ROSAMUND.,"Zabraes, pataches, galleys of Portugal,"
497,ROSAMUND.,"Caravels rowed with oars, their galliasses"
498,ROSAMUND.,"Vast, and complete with chapels, chambers, towers."
499,ROSAMUND.,And in the said ships of free mariners
500,ROSAMUND.,"Eight thousand, and of slaves two thousand more,"
501,ROSAMUND.,An army twenty thousand strong. O then
502,ROSAMUND.,"Of culverin, of double culverin,"
503,ROSAMUND.,"Ordnance and arms, all furniture of war,"
504,ROSAMUND.,"Victual, and last their fierceness and great spleen,"
505,ROSAMUND.,"Willing to founder, burn, split, wreck themselves,"
506,ROSAMUND.,"But they would land, fight, overcome, and reign."
507,ROSAMUND.,
508,ROSAMUND.,"Then would we count up England. Set by theirs,"
509,ROSAMUND.,Her fleet as walnut shells. And a few pikes
510,ROSAMUND.,"Stored in the belfries, and a few brave men"
511,ROSAMUND.,"For wielding them. But as the morning wore,"
512,ROSAMUND.,"And we went ever eastward, ever on,"
513,ROSAMUND.,"Poured forth, poured down, a marching multitude"
514,ROSAMUND.,With stir about the towns; and waggons rolled
515,ROSAMUND.,With offerings for the army and the fleet.
516,ROSAMUND.,"Then to our hearts valour crept home again,"
517,ROSAMUND.,The loathèd name of Alva fanning it;
518,ROSAMUND.,Alva who did convert from our old faith
519,ROSAMUND.,With many a black deed done for a white cause
520,ROSAMUND.,(So spake they erewhile to it dedicate)
521,ROSAMUND.,"Them whom not death could change, nor fire, nor sword,"
522,ROSAMUND.,To thirst for his undoing.
523,ROSAMUND.,
524,ROSAMUND.,"Ay, as I am a Christian man, our thirst"
525,ROSAMUND.,Was comparable with Queen Mary's. All
526,ROSAMUND.,"The talk was of confounding heretics,"
527,ROSAMUND.,"The heretics the Spaniards. Yet methought,"
528,ROSAMUND.,'O their great multitude! Not harbour room
529,ROSAMUND.,On our long coast for that great multitude.
530,ROSAMUND.,"They land--for who can let them--give us battle,"
531,ROSAMUND.,"And after give us burial. Who but they,"
532,ROSAMUND.,For he that liveth shall be flying north
533,ROSAMUND.,To bear off wife and child. Our very graves
534,ROSAMUND.,"Shall Spaniards dig, and in the daisied grass"
535,ROSAMUND.,Trample them down.'
536,ROSAMUND.,"Ay, whoso will be brave,"
537,ROSAMUND.,Let him be brave beforehand. After th' event
538,ROSAMUND.,If by good pleasure of God it go as then
539,ROSAMUND.,He shall be brave an' liketh him. I say
540,ROSAMUND.,Was no man but that deadly peril feared.
541,ROSAMUND.,
542,ROSAMUND.,"Nights riding two. Scant rest. Days riding three,"
543,ROSAMUND.,Then Foulkstone. Need is none to tell all forth
544,ROSAMUND.,"The gathering stores and men, the charter'd ship"
545,ROSAMUND.,"That I, with two, my friends, got ready for sea."
546,ROSAMUND.,"Ready she was, so many another, small"
547,ROSAMUND.,"But nimble; and we sailing hugged the shore,"
548,ROSAMUND.,"Scarce venturing out, so Drake had willed, a league,"
549,ROSAMUND.,"And running westward aye as best we might,"
550,ROSAMUND.,When suddenly--behold them!
551,ROSAMUND.,"On they rocked,"
552,ROSAMUND.,"Majestical, slow, sailing with the wind."
553,ROSAMUND.,"O such a sight! O such a sight, mine eyes,"
554,ROSAMUND.,Never shall you see more!
555,ROSAMUND.,"In crescent form,"
556,ROSAMUND.,A vasty crescent nigh two leagues across
557,ROSAMUND.,"From horn to horn, the lesser ships within,"
558,ROSAMUND.,"The great without, they did bestride as 't were"
559,ROSAMUND.,And make a township on the narrow seas.
560,ROSAMUND.,
561,ROSAMUND.,It was about the point of dawn: and light.
562,ROSAMUND.,"All grey the sea, and ghostly grey the ships;"
563,ROSAMUND.,"And after in the offing rocked our fleet,"
564,ROSAMUND.,Having lain quiet in the summer dark.
565,ROSAMUND.,
566,ROSAMUND.,"O then methought, 'Flash, blessed gold of dawn,"
567,ROSAMUND.,"And touch the topsails of our Admiral,"
568,ROSAMUND.,"That he may after guide an emulous flock,"
569,ROSAMUND.,Old England's innocent white bleating lambs.
570,ROSAMUND.,"Let Spain within a pike's length hear them bleat,"
571,ROSAMUND.,Delivering of their pretty talk in a tongue
572,ROSAMUND.,Whose meaning cries not for interpreter.'
573,ROSAMUND.,
574,ROSAMUND.,"And while I spoke, their topsails, friend and foe,"
575,ROSAMUND.,Glittered--and there was noise of guns; pale smoke
576,ROSAMUND.,"Lagged after, curdling on the sun-fleck'd main."
577,ROSAMUND.,"And after that? What after that, my soul?"
578,ROSAMUND.,Who ever saw weakling white butterflies
579,ROSAMUND.,"Chasing of gallant swans, and charging them,"
580,ROSAMUND.,And spitting at them long red streaks of flame?
581,ROSAMUND.,We saw the ships of England even so
582,ROSAMUND.,As in my vaunting wish that mocked itself
583,ROSAMUND.,"With 'Fool, O fool, to brag at the edge of loss.'"
584,ROSAMUND.,We saw the ships of England even so
585,ROSAMUND.,"Run at the Spaniards on a wind, lay to,"
586,ROSAMUND.,"Bespatter them with hail of battle, then"
587,ROSAMUND.,"Take their prerogative of nimble steerage,"
588,ROSAMUND.,"Fly off, and ere the enemy, heavy in hand,"
589,ROSAMUND.,Delivered his reply to the wasteful wave
590,ROSAMUND.,"That made its grave of foam, race out of range,"
591,ROSAMUND.,"Then tack and crowd all sail, and after them"
592,ROSAMUND.,Again.
593,ROSAMUND.,"So harassed they that mighty foe,"
594,ROSAMUND.,Moving in all its bravery to the east.
595,ROSAMUND.,"And some were fine with pictures of the saints,"
596,ROSAMUND.,"Angels with flying hair and peakèd wings,"
597,ROSAMUND.,And high red crosses wrought upon their sails;
598,ROSAMUND.,"From every mast brave flag or ensign flew,"
599,ROSAMUND.,And their long silken pennons serpented
600,ROSAMUND.,"Loose to the morning. And the galley slaves,"
601,ROSAMUND.,"Albeit their chains did clink, sang at the oar."
602,ROSAMUND.,
603,ROSAMUND.,The sea was striped e'en like a tiger skin
604,ROSAMUND.,With wide ship wakes.
605,ROSAMUND.,"And many cried, amazed,"
606,ROSAMUND.,'What means their patience?'
607,ROSAMUND.,"'Lo you,' others said,"
608,ROSAMUND.,'They pay with fear for their great costliness.
609,ROSAMUND.,Some of their costliest needs must other guard;
610,ROSAMUND.,"Once guarded and in port look to yourselves,"
611,ROSAMUND.,They count one hundred and fifty. It behoves
612,ROSAMUND.,Better they suffer this long running fight--
613,ROSAMUND.,"Better for them than that they give us battle,"
614,ROSAMUND.,And so delay the shelter of their roads.
615,ROSAMUND.,
616,ROSAMUND.,"'Two of their caravels we sank, and one"
617,ROSAMUND.,(Fouled with her consort in the rigging) took
618,ROSAMUND.,Ere she could catch the wind when she rode free.
619,ROSAMUND.,"And we have riddled many a sail, and split"
620,ROSAMUND.,Of spars a score or two. What then? To-morrow
621,ROSAMUND.,"They look to straddle across the strait, and hold"
622,ROSAMUND.,Having aye Calais for a shelter--hold
623,ROSAMUND.,Our ships in fight. To-morrow shall give account
624,ROSAMUND.,For our to-day. They will not we pass north
625,ROSAMUND.,To meddle with Parma's flotilla; their hope
626,ROSAMUND.,"Being Parma, and a convoy they would be"
627,ROSAMUND.,For his flat boats that bode invasion to us;
628,ROSAMUND.,"And if he reach to London--ruin, defeat.'"
629,ROSAMUND.,
630,ROSAMUND.,"Three fleets the sun went down on, theirs of fame"
631,ROSAMUND.,Th' Armada. After space old England's few;
632,ROSAMUND.,"And after that our dancing cockle-shells,"
633,ROSAMUND.,"The volunteers. They took some pride in us,"
634,ROSAMUND.,"For we were nimble, and we brought them powder,"
635,ROSAMUND.,"Shot, weapons. They were short of these. Ill found,"
636,ROSAMUND.,Ill found. The bitter fruit of evil thrift.
637,ROSAMUND.,"But while obsequious, darting here and there,"
638,ROSAMUND.,"We took their messages from ship to ship,"
639,ROSAMUND.,"From ship to shore, the moving majesties"
640,ROSAMUND.,"Made Calais Roads, cast anchor, all their less"
641,ROSAMUND.,In the middle ward; their greater ships outside
642,ROSAMUND.,Impregnable castles fearing not assault.
643,ROSAMUND.,
644,ROSAMUND.,"So did we read their thought, and read it wrong,"
645,ROSAMUND.,"While after the running fight we rode at ease,"
646,ROSAMUND.,For many (as is the way of Englishmen)
647,ROSAMUND.,"Having made light of our stout deeds, and light"
648,ROSAMUND.,"O' the effects proceeding, saw these spread"
649,ROSAMUND.,"To view. The Spanish Admiral's mighty host,"
650,ROSAMUND.,"Albeit not broken, harass'd."
651,ROSAMUND.,Some did tow
652,ROSAMUND.,"Others that we had plagued, disabled, rent;"
653,ROSAMUND.,Many full heavily damaged made their berths.
654,ROSAMUND.,
655,ROSAMUND.,Then did the English anchor out of range.
656,ROSAMUND.,"To close was not their wisdom with such foe,"
657,ROSAMUND.,"Rather to chase him, following in the rear."
658,ROSAMUND.,"Ay, truly they were giants in our eyes"
659,ROSAMUND.,"And in our own. They took scant heed of us,"
660,ROSAMUND.,"And we looked on, and knew not what to think,"
661,ROSAMUND.,"Only that we were lost men, a lost Isle,"
662,ROSAMUND.,"In every Spaniard's mind, both great and small."
663,ROSAMUND.,
664,ROSAMUND.,"But no such thought had place in Howard's soul,"
665,ROSAMUND.,"And when 't was dark, and all their sails were furled,"
666,ROSAMUND.,"When the wind veered a few points to the west,"
667,ROSAMUND.,"And the tide turned ruffling along the roads,"
668,ROSAMUND.,He sent eight fireships forging down to them.
669,ROSAMUND.,
670,ROSAMUND.,Terrible! Terrible!
671,ROSAMUND.,Blood-red pillars of reek
672,ROSAMUND.,"They looked on that vast host and troubled it,"
673,ROSAMUND.,As on th' Egyptian host One looked of old.
674,ROSAMUND.,
675,ROSAMUND.,"Then all the heavens were rent with a great cry,"
676,ROSAMUND.,"The red avengers went right on, right on,"
677,ROSAMUND.,"For none could let them; then was ruin, reek, flame;"
678,ROSAMUND.,Against th' unwieldy huge leviathans
679,ROSAMUND.,"They drave, they fell upon them as wild beasts,"
680,ROSAMUND.,"And all together they did plunge and grind,"
681,ROSAMUND.,"Their reefed sails set a-blazing, these flew loose"
682,ROSAMUND.,And forth like banners of destruction sped.
683,ROSAMUND.,It was to look on as the body of hell
684,ROSAMUND.,"Seething; and some, their cables cut, ran foul"
685,ROSAMUND.,"Of one the other, while the ruddy fire"
686,ROSAMUND.,Sped on aloft. One ship was stranded. One
687,ROSAMUND.,"Foundered, and went down burning; all the sea"
688,ROSAMUND.,Red as an angry sunset was made fell
689,ROSAMUND.,"With smoke and blazing spars that rode upright,"
690,ROSAMUND.,For as the fireships burst they scattered forth
691,ROSAMUND.,Full dangerous wreckage. All the sky they scored
692,ROSAMUND.,"With flying sails and rocking masts, and yards"
693,ROSAMUND.,Licked of long flames. And flitting tinder sank
694,ROSAMUND.,In eddies on the plagued mixed mob of ships
695,ROSAMUND.,"That cared no more for harbour, and were fain"
696,ROSAMUND.,"At any hazard to be forth, and leave"
697,ROSAMUND.,Their berths in the blood-red haze.
698,ROSAMUND.,
699,ROSAMUND.,It was at twelve
700,ROSAMUND.,"O' the clock when this fell out, for as the eight"
701,ROSAMUND.,"Were towed, and left upon the friendly tide"
702,ROSAMUND.,To stalk like evil angels over the deep
703,ROSAMUND.,"And stare upon the Spaniards, we did hear"
704,ROSAMUND.,Their midnight bells. It was at morning dawn
705,ROSAMUND.,After our mariners thus had harried them
706,ROSAMUND.,"I looked my last upon their fleet,--and all,"
707,ROSAMUND.,"That night had cut their cables, put to sea,"
708,ROSAMUND.,And scattering wide towards the Flemish coast
709,ROSAMUND.,Did seem to make for Greveline.
710,ROSAMUND.,
711,ROSAMUND.,"As for us,"
712,ROSAMUND.,"The captains told us off to wait on them,"
713,ROSAMUND.,"Bearers of wounded enemies and friends,"
714,ROSAMUND.,"Bearers of messages, bearers of store."
715,ROSAMUND.,
716,ROSAMUND.,"We saw not ought, but heard enough: we heard"
717,ROSAMUND.,(And God be thanked) of that long scattering chase
718,ROSAMUND.,"And driving of Sidonia from his hope,"
719,ROSAMUND.,"Parma, who could not ought without his ships"
720,ROSAMUND.,"And looked for them to break the Dutch blockade,"
721,ROSAMUND.,He meanwhile chafing lion-like in his lair.
722,ROSAMUND.,"We heard--and he--for all one summer day,"
723,ROSAMUND.,"Fenning and Drake and Raynor, Fenton, Cross,"
724,ROSAMUND.,"And more, by Greveline, where they once again"
725,ROSAMUND.,"Did get the wind o' the Spaniards, noise of guns."
726,ROSAMUND.,"For coming with the wind, wielding themselves"
727,ROSAMUND.,Which way they listed (while in close array
728,ROSAMUND.,"The Spaniards stood but on defence), our own"
729,ROSAMUND.,"Went at them, charged them high and charged them sore,"
730,ROSAMUND.,"And gave them broadside after broadside. Ay,"
731,ROSAMUND.,Till all the shot was spent both great and small.
732,ROSAMUND.,It failed; and in regard of that same want
733,ROSAMUND.,They thought it not convenient to pursue
734,ROSAMUND.,Their vessels farther.
735,ROSAMUND.,"They were huge withal,"
736,ROSAMUND.,"And might not be encountered one to one,"
737,ROSAMUND.,"But close conjoined they fought, and poured great store"
738,ROSAMUND.,"Of ordnance at our ships, though many of theirs,"
739,ROSAMUND.,"Shot thorow and thorow, scarce might keep afloat."
740,ROSAMUND.,
741,ROSAMUND.,"Many were captured fighting, many sank."
742,ROSAMUND.,"This news they brought returned perforce, and left"
743,ROSAMUND.,The Spaniards forging north. Themselves did watch
744,ROSAMUND.,"The river mouth, till Howard, his new store"
745,ROSAMUND.,"Gathered, encounter coveting, once more"
746,ROSAMUND.,Made after them with Drake.
747,ROSAMUND.,And lo! the wind
748,ROSAMUND.,Got up to help us. He yet flying north
749,ROSAMUND.,(Their doughty Admiral) made all his wake
750,ROSAMUND.,"To smoke, and would not end to fight, but strewed"
751,ROSAMUND.,The ocean with his wreckage. And the wind
752,ROSAMUND.,"Drave him before it, and the storm was fell,"
753,ROSAMUND.,And he went up to th' uncouth northern sea.
754,ROSAMUND.,There did our mariners leave him. Then did joy
755,ROSAMUND.,"Run like a sunbeam over the land, and joy"
756,ROSAMUND.,Rule in the stout heart of a regnant Queen.
757,ROSAMUND.,
758,ROSAMUND.,"But now the counsel came, 'Every man home,"
759,ROSAMUND.,"For after Scotland rounded, when he curves"
760,ROSAMUND.,"Southward, and all the batter'd armament,"
761,ROSAMUND.,What hinders on our undefended coast
762,ROSAMUND.,To land where'er he listeth? Every man
763,ROSAMUND.,Home.'
764,ROSAMUND.,And we mounted and did open forth
765,ROSAMUND.,"Like a great fan, to east, to north, to west,"
766,ROSAMUND.,"And rumour met us flying, filtering"
767,ROSAMUND.,"Down through the border. News of wicked joy,"
768,ROSAMUND.,"The wreckers rich in the Faroes, and the Isles"
769,ROSAMUND.,"Orkney, and all the clansmen full of gear"
770,ROSAMUND.,Gathered from helpless mariners tempted in
771,ROSAMUND.,To their undoing; while a treacherous crew
772,ROSAMUND.,"Let the storm work upon their lives its will,"
773,ROSAMUND.,Spoiled them and gathered all their riches up.
774,ROSAMUND.,"Then did they meet like fate from Irish kernes,"
775,ROSAMUND.,Who dealt with them according to their wont.
776,ROSAMUND.,
777,ROSAMUND.,In a great storm of wind that tore green leaves
778,ROSAMUND.,"And dashed them wet upon me, came I home."
779,ROSAMUND.,"Then greeted me my dame, and Rosamund,"
780,ROSAMUND.,"Our one dear child, the heir of these my fields--"
781,ROSAMUND.,"That I should sigh to think it! There, no more."
782,ROSAMUND.,
783,ROSAMUND.,Being right weary I betook me straight
784,ROSAMUND.,"To longed-for sleep, and I did dream and dream"
785,ROSAMUND.,Through all that dolourous storm; though noise of guns
786,ROSAMUND.,"Daunted the country in the moonless night,"
787,ROSAMUND.,Yet sank I deep and deeper in the dream
788,ROSAMUND.,And took my fill of rest.
789,ROSAMUND.,"A voice, a touch,"
790,ROSAMUND.,"'Wake.' Lo! my wife beside me, her wet hair"
791,ROSAMUND.,"She wrung with her wet hands, and cried, 'A ship!"
792,ROSAMUND.,I have been down the beach. O pitiful!
793,ROSAMUND.,"A Spanish ship ashore between the rocks,"
794,ROSAMUND.,And none to guide our people. Wake.'
795,ROSAMUND.,Then I
796,ROSAMUND.,Raised on mine elbow looked; it was high day;
797,ROSAMUND.,In the windy pother seas came in like smoke
798,ROSAMUND.,"That blew among the trees as fine small rain,"
799,ROSAMUND.,And then the broken water sun-besprent
800,ROSAMUND.,"Glitter'd, fell back and showed her high and fast"
801,ROSAMUND.,"A caravel, a pinnace that methought"
802,ROSAMUND.,To some great ship had longed; her hap alone
803,ROSAMUND.,Of all that multitude it was to drive
804,ROSAMUND.,"Between this land of England her right foe,"
805,ROSAMUND.,"And that most cruel, where (for all their faith"
806,ROSAMUND.,Was one) no drop of water mote they drink
807,ROSAMUND.,For love of God nor love of gold.
808,ROSAMUND.,I rose
809,ROSAMUND.,"And hasted; I was soon among the folk,"
810,ROSAMUND.,"But late for work. The crew, spent, faint, and bruised"
811,ROSAMUND.,"Saved for the most part of our men, lay prone"
812,ROSAMUND.,"In grass, and women served them bread and mead,"
813,ROSAMUND.,Other the sea laid decently alone
814,ROSAMUND.,Ready for burial. And a litter stood
815,ROSAMUND.,"In shade. Upon it lying a goodly man,"
816,ROSAMUND.,"The govourner or the captain as it seemed,"
817,ROSAMUND.,"Dead in his stiff gold-broider'd bravery,"
818,ROSAMUND.,And epaulet and sword. They must have loved
819,ROSAMUND.,"That man, for many had died to bring him in,"
820,ROSAMUND.,Their boats stove in were stranded here and there.
821,ROSAMUND.,"In one--but how I know not--brought they him,"
822,ROSAMUND.,"And he was laid upon a folded flag,"
823,ROSAMUND.,"Many times doubled for his greater ease,"
824,ROSAMUND.,That was our thought--and we made signs to them
825,ROSAMUND.,He should have sepulture. But when they knew
826,ROSAMUND.,"They must needs leave him, for some marched them off"
827,ROSAMUND.,"For more safe custody, they made great moan."
828,ROSAMUND.,
829,ROSAMUND.,"After, with two my neighbours drawing nigh,"
830,ROSAMUND.,"One of them touched the Spaniard's hand and said,"
831,ROSAMUND.,"'Dead is he but not cold;' the other then,"
832,ROSAMUND.,'Nay in good truth methinks he be not dead.'
833,ROSAMUND.,"Again the first, 'An' if he breatheth yet"
834,ROSAMUND.,"He lies at his last gasp.' And this went off,"
835,ROSAMUND.,"And left us two, that by the litter stayed,"
836,ROSAMUND.,"Looking on one another, and we looked"
837,ROSAMUND.,"(For neither willed to speak), and yet looked on."
838,ROSAMUND.,Then would he have me know the meet was fixed
839,ROSAMUND.,"For nine o' the clock, and to be brief with you"
840,ROSAMUND.,He left me. And I had the Spaniard home.
841,ROSAMUND.,What other could be done? I had him home.
842,ROSAMUND.,"Men on his litter bare him, set him down"
843,ROSAMUND.,In a fair chamber that was nigh the hall.
844,ROSAMUND.,
845,ROSAMUND.,"And yet he waked not from his deathly swoon,"
846,ROSAMUND.,"Albeit my wife did try her skill, and now"
847,ROSAMUND.,"Bad lay him on a bed, when lo the folds"
848,ROSAMUND.,"Of that great ensign covered store of gold,"
849,ROSAMUND.,"Rich Spanish ducats, raiment, Moorish blades"
850,ROSAMUND.,"Chased in right goodly wise, and missals rare,"
851,ROSAMUND.,And other gear. I locked it for my part
852,ROSAMUND.,"Into an armoury, and that fair flag"
853,ROSAMUND.,(While we did talk full low till he should end)
854,ROSAMUND.,"Spread over him. Methought, the man shall die"
855,ROSAMUND.,"Under his country's colours; he was brave,"
856,ROSAMUND.,His deadly wound to that doth testify.
857,ROSAMUND.,
858,ROSAMUND.,"And when 't was seemly order'd, Rosamund,"
859,ROSAMUND.,"My daughter, who had looked not yet on death,"
860,ROSAMUND.,"Came in, a face all marvel, pity, and dread--"
861,ROSAMUND.,"Lying against her shoulder sword-long flowers,"
862,ROSAMUND.,White hollyhocks to cross upon his breast.
863,ROSAMUND.,"Slowly she turned as of that sight afeard,"
864,ROSAMUND.,"But while with daunted heart she moved anigh,"
865,ROSAMUND.,"His eyelids quiver'd, quiver'd then the lip,"
866,ROSAMUND.,"And he, reviving, with a sob looked up"
867,ROSAMUND.,And set on her the midnight of his eyes.
868,ROSAMUND.,
869,ROSAMUND.,"Then she, in act to place the burial gift"
870,ROSAMUND.,"Bending above him, and her flaxen hair"
871,ROSAMUND.,"Fall'n to her hand, drew back and stood upright"
872,ROSAMUND.,"Comely and tall, her innocent fair face"
873,ROSAMUND.,Cover'd with blushes more of joy than shame.
874,ROSAMUND.,"'Father,' she cried, 'O father, I am glad."
875,ROSAMUND.,"Look you! the enemy liveth.' ''T is enough,"
876,ROSAMUND.,"My maiden,' quoth her mother, 'thou may'st forth,"
877,ROSAMUND.,But say an Avè first for him with me.'
878,ROSAMUND.,
879,ROSAMUND.,Then they with hands upright at foot o' his bed
880,ROSAMUND.,"Knelt, his dark dying eyes at gaze on them,"
881,ROSAMUND.,"Till as I think for wonder at them, more"
882,ROSAMUND.,"Than for his proper strength, he could not die."
883,ROSAMUND.,
884,ROSAMUND.,"So in obedient wise my daughter risen,"
885,ROSAMUND.,"And going, let a smile of comforting cheer"
886,ROSAMUND.,"Lift her sweet lip, and that was all of her"
887,ROSAMUND.,For many a night and day that he beheld.
888,ROSAMUND.,
889,ROSAMUND.,"And then withal my dame, a leech of skill,"
890,ROSAMUND.,"Tended the Spaniard fain to heal his wound,"
891,ROSAMUND.,Her women aiding at their best. And he
892,ROSAMUND.,'Twixt life and death awaken'd in the night
893,ROSAMUND.,"Full oft in his own tongue would make his moan,"
894,ROSAMUND.,"And when he whisper'd any word I knew,"
895,ROSAMUND.,"If I was present, for to pleasure him,"
896,ROSAMUND.,Then made I repetition of the same.
897,ROSAMUND.,"'Cordova,' quoth he faintly, 'Cordova,'"
898,ROSAMUND.,"'T was the first word he mutter'd. 'Ay, we know,'"
899,ROSAMUND.,"Quoth I, 'the stoutness of that fight ye made"
900,ROSAMUND.,"Against the Moors and their Mahometry,"
901,ROSAMUND.,"And dispossess'd the men of fame, the fierce"
902,ROSAMUND.,"Khalifs of Cordova--thy home belike,"
903,ROSAMUND.,Thy city. A fair city Cordova.'
904,ROSAMUND.,
905,ROSAMUND.,"Then after many days, while his wound healed,"
906,ROSAMUND.,He with abundant seemly sign set forth
907,ROSAMUND.,"His thanks, but as for language had we none,"
908,ROSAMUND.,And oft he strove and failed to let us know
909,ROSAMUND.,"Some wish he had, but could not, so a week,"
910,ROSAMUND.,"Two weeks went by. Then Rosamund my girl,"
911,ROSAMUND.,"Hearing her mother plain on this, she saith,"
912,ROSAMUND.,"'So please you, madam, show the enemy"
913,ROSAMUND.,"A Psalter in our English tongue, and fetch"
914,ROSAMUND.,And give him that same book my father found
915,ROSAMUND.,Wrapped in the ensign. Are they not the same
916,ROSAMUND.,"Those holy words? The Spaniard being devout,"
917,ROSAMUND.,He needs must know them.'
918,ROSAMUND.,"'Peace, thou pretty fool!"
919,ROSAMUND.,Is this a time to teach an alien tongue?'
920,ROSAMUND.,"Her mother made for answer. 'He is sick,"
921,ROSAMUND.,"The Spaniard.' 'Cry you mercy,' quoth my girl,"
922,ROSAMUND.,'But I did think 't were easy to let show
923,ROSAMUND.,How both the Psalters are of meaning like;
924,ROSAMUND.,"If he know Latin, and 't is like he doth,"
925,ROSAMUND.,So might he choose a verse to tell his thought.'
926,ROSAMUND.,
927,ROSAMUND.,"Then said I (ay, I did!) 'The girl shall try,'"
928,ROSAMUND.,"And straight I took her to the Spaniard's side,"
929,ROSAMUND.,"And he, admiring at her, all his face"
930,ROSAMUND.,"Changed to a joy that almost showed as fear,"
931,ROSAMUND.,"So innocent holy she did look, so grave"
932,ROSAMUND.,Her pitiful eyes.
933,ROSAMUND.,"She sat beside his bed,"
934,ROSAMUND.,He covered with the ensign yet; and took
935,ROSAMUND.,"And showed the Psalters both, and she did speak"
936,ROSAMUND.,"Her English words, but gazing was enough"
937,ROSAMUND.,"For him at her sweet dimple, her blue eyes"
938,ROSAMUND.,"That shone, her English blushes. Rosamund,"
939,ROSAMUND.,"My beautiful dear child. He did but gaze,"
940,ROSAMUND.,And not perceive her meaning till she touched
941,ROSAMUND.,"His hand, and in her Psalter showed the word."
942,ROSAMUND.,
943,ROSAMUND.,"Then was all light to him; he laughed for joy,"
944,ROSAMUND.,"And took the Latin Missal. O full soon,"
945,ROSAMUND.,"Alas, how soon, one read the other's thought!"
946,ROSAMUND.,"Before she left him, she had learned his name"
947,ROSAMUND.,"Alonzo, told him hers, and found the care"
948,ROSAMUND.,"Made night and day uneasy--Cordova,"
949,ROSAMUND.,"There dwelt his father, there his kin, nor knew"
950,ROSAMUND.,"Whether he lived or died, whether in thrall"
951,ROSAMUND.,To the Islanders for lack of ransom pined
952,ROSAMUND.,Or rued the galling yoke of slavery.
953,ROSAMUND.,
954,ROSAMUND.,So did he cast him on our kindness. I--
955,ROSAMUND.,"And care not who may know it--I was kind,"
956,ROSAMUND.,And for that our stout Queen did think foul scorn
957,ROSAMUND.,"To kill the Spanish prisoners, and to guard"
958,ROSAMUND.,"So many could not, liefer being to rid"
959,ROSAMUND.,"Our country of them than to spite their own,"
960,ROSAMUND.,"I made him as I might that matter learn,"
961,ROSAMUND.,"Eking scant Latin with my daughter's wit,"
962,ROSAMUND.,And told him men let forth and driven forth
963,ROSAMUND.,"Did crowd our harbours for the ports of Spain,"
964,ROSAMUND.,"By one of whom, he, with good aid of mine,"
965,ROSAMUND.,"Should let his tidings go, and I plucked forth"
966,ROSAMUND.,His ducats that a meet reward might be.
967,ROSAMUND.,"Then he, the water standing in his eyes,"
968,ROSAMUND.,Made old King David's words due thanks convey.
969,ROSAMUND.,
970,ROSAMUND.,"Then Rosamund, this all made plain, arose"
971,ROSAMUND.,"And curtsey'd to the Spaniard. Ah, methinks"
972,ROSAMUND.,"I yet behold her, gracious, innocent,"
973,ROSAMUND.,"And flaxen-haired, and blushing maidenly,"
974,ROSAMUND.,"When turning she retired, and his black eyes,"
975,ROSAMUND.,"That hunger'd after her, did follow on;"
976,ROSAMUND.,"And I bethought me, 'Thou shalt see no more,"
977,ROSAMUND.,"Thou goodly enemy, my one ewe lamb.'"
978,ROSAMUND.,
979,ROSAMUND.,"O, I would make short work of this. The wound"
980,ROSAMUND.,"Healed, and the Spaniard rose, then could he stand,"
981,ROSAMUND.,And then about his chamber walk at ease.
982,ROSAMUND.,
983,ROSAMUND.,"Now we had counsell'd how to have him home,"
984,ROSAMUND.,And that same trading vessel beating up
985,ROSAMUND.,"The Irish Channel at my will, that same"
986,ROSAMUND.,"I charter'd for to serve me in the war,"
987,ROSAMUND.,Next was I minded should mine enemy
988,ROSAMUND.,"Deliver to his father, and his land."
989,ROSAMUND.,"Daily we looked for her, till in our cove,"
990,ROSAMUND.,"Upon that morn when first the Spaniard walked,"
991,ROSAMUND.,Behold her rocking; and I hasted down
992,ROSAMUND.,And left him waiting in the house.
993,ROSAMUND.,Woe 's me!
994,ROSAMUND.,"All being ready speed I home, and lo"
995,ROSAMUND.,"My Rosamund, that by the Spaniard sat"
996,ROSAMUND.,"Upon a cushion'd settle, book in hand."
997,ROSAMUND.,I needs must think how in the deep alcove
998,ROSAMUND.,Thick chequer'd shadows of the window-glass
999,ROSAMUND.,"Did fall across her kirtle and her locks,"
1000,ROSAMUND.,For I did see her thus no more.
1001,ROSAMUND.,She held
1002,ROSAMUND.,"Her Psalter, and he his, and slowly read"
1003,ROSAMUND.,Till he would stop her at the needed word.
1004,ROSAMUND.,"'O well is thee,' she read, my Rosamund,"
1005,ROSAMUND.,"'O well is thee, and happy shalt thou be."
1006,ROSAMUND.,"Thy wife--' and there he stopped her, and he took"
1007,ROSAMUND.,"And kissed her hand, and show'd in 's own a ring,"
1008,ROSAMUND.,"Taking no heed of me, no heed at all."
1009,ROSAMUND.,
1010,ROSAMUND.,"Then I burst forth, the choler red i' my face"
1011,ROSAMUND.,"When I did see her blush, and put it on."
1012,ROSAMUND.,"'Give me,' quoth I, and Rosamund, afraid,"
1013,ROSAMUND.,"Gave me the ring. I set my heel on it,"
1014,ROSAMUND.,"Crushed it, and sent the rubies scattering forth,"
1015,ROSAMUND.,And did in righteous anger storm at him.
1016,ROSAMUND.,"'What! what!' quoth I, 'before her father's eyes,"
1017,ROSAMUND.,"Thou universal villain, thou ingrate,"
1018,ROSAMUND.,"Thou enemy whom I shelter'd, fed, restored,"
1019,ROSAMUND.,"Most basest of mankind!' And Rosamund,"
1020,ROSAMUND.,"Arisen, her forehead pressed against mine arm,"
1021,ROSAMUND.,"And 'Father,' cries she, 'father.'"
1022,ROSAMUND.,And I stormed
1023,ROSAMUND.,"At him, while in his Spanish he replied"
1024,ROSAMUND.,As one would speak me fair. 'Thou Spanish hound!'
1025,ROSAMUND.,"'Father,' she pleaded. 'Alien vile,' quoth I,"
1026,ROSAMUND.,"'Plucked from the death, wilt thou repay me thus?"
1027,ROSAMUND.,It is but three times thou hast set thine eyes
1028,ROSAMUND.,"On this my daughter.' 'Father,' moans my girl;"
1029,ROSAMUND.,"And I, not willing to be so withstood,"
1030,ROSAMUND.,Spoke roughly to her. Then the Spaniard's eyes
1031,ROSAMUND.,"Blazed--then he stormed at me in his own tongue,"
1032,ROSAMUND.,And all his Spanish arrogance and pride
1033,ROSAMUND.,Broke witless on my wrathful English. Then
1034,ROSAMUND.,"He let me know, for I perceived it well,"
1035,ROSAMUND.,"He reckon'd him mine equal, thought foul scorn"
1036,ROSAMUND.,"Of my displeasure, and was wroth with me"
1037,ROSAMUND.,"As I with him. 'Father,' sighed Rosamund."
1038,ROSAMUND.,"'Go, get thee to thy mother, girl,' quoth I."
1039,ROSAMUND.,"And slowly, slowly, she betook herself"
1040,ROSAMUND.,Down the long hall; in lowly wise she went
1041,ROSAMUND.,And made her moans.
1042,ROSAMUND.,But when my girl was gone
1043,ROSAMUND.,"I stood at fault, th' occasion master'd me;"
1044,ROSAMUND.,"Belike it master'd him, for both felt mute."
1045,ROSAMUND.,"I calmed me, and he calmed him as he might."
1046,ROSAMUND.,"For I bethought me I was yet an host,"
1047,ROSAMUND.,And he bethought him on the worthiness
1048,ROSAMUND.,Of my first deeds.
1049,ROSAMUND.,So made I sign to him.
1050,ROSAMUND.,"The tide was up, and soon I had him forth,"
1051,ROSAMUND.,"Delivered him his goods, commended him"
1052,ROSAMUND.,"To the captain o' the vessel, then plucked off"
1053,ROSAMUND.,"My hat, in seemly fashion taking leave,"
1054,ROSAMUND.,"And he was not outdone, but every way"
1055,ROSAMUND.,"Gave me respect, and on the deck we two"
1056,ROSAMUND.,"Parted, as I did hope, to meet no more."
1057,ROSAMUND.,
1058,ROSAMUND.,"Alas! my Rosamund, my Rosamund!"
1059,ROSAMUND.,"She did not weep, no. Plain upon me, no."
1060,ROSAMUND.,Her eyes mote well have lost the trick of tears:
1061,ROSAMUND.,"As new-washed flowers shake off the down-dropt rain,"
1062,ROSAMUND.,"And make denial of it, yet more blue"
1063,ROSAMUND.,"And fair of favour afterward, so they."
1064,ROSAMUND.,The wild woodrose was not more fresh of blee
1065,ROSAMUND.,"Than her soft dimpled cheek: but I beheld,"
1066,ROSAMUND.,"Come home, a token hung about her neck,"
1067,ROSAMUND.,"Sparkling upon her bosom for his sake,"
1068,ROSAMUND.,"Her love, the Spaniard, she denied it not,"
1069,ROSAMUND.,"All unaware, good sooth, such love was bale."
1070,ROSAMUND.,
1071,ROSAMUND.,"And all that day went like another day,"
1072,ROSAMUND.,"Ay, all the next; then was I glad at heart;"
1073,ROSAMUND.,"Methought, 'I am glad thou wilt not waste thy youth"
1074,ROSAMUND.,"Upon an alien man, mine enemy,"
1075,ROSAMUND.,"Thy nation's enemy. In truth, in truth,"
1076,ROSAMUND.,"This likes me very well. My most dear child,"
1077,ROSAMUND.,Forget yon grave dark mariner. The Lord
1078,ROSAMUND.,"Everlasting,' I besought, 'bring it to pass.'"
1079,ROSAMUND.,
1080,ROSAMUND.,"Stealeth a darker day within my hall,"
1081,ROSAMUND.,A winter day of wind and driving foam.
1082,ROSAMUND.,They tell me that my girl is sick--and yet
1083,ROSAMUND.,"Not very sick. I may not hour by hour,"
1084,ROSAMUND.,"More than one watching of a moon that wanes,"
1085,ROSAMUND.,Make chronicle of change. A parlous change
1086,ROSAMUND.,When he looks back to that same moon at full.
1087,ROSAMUND.,
1088,ROSAMUND.,"Ah! ah! methought, 't will pass. It did not pass,"
1089,ROSAMUND.,Though never she made moan. I saw the rings
1090,ROSAMUND.,"Drop from her small white wasted hand. And I,"
1091,ROSAMUND.,"Her father, tamed of grief, I would have given"
1092,ROSAMUND.,"My land, my name to have her as of old."
1093,ROSAMUND.,"Ay, Rosamund I speak of with the small"
1094,ROSAMUND.,"White face. Ay, Rosamund. O near as white,"
1095,ROSAMUND.,"And mournfuller by much, her mother dear"
1096,ROSAMUND.,Drooped by her couch; and while of hope and fear
1097,ROSAMUND.,"Lifted or left, as by a changeful tide,"
1098,ROSAMUND.,"We thought 'The girl is better,' or we thought"
1099,ROSAMUND.,"'The girl will die,' that jewel from her neck"
1100,ROSAMUND.,"She drew, and prayed me send it to her love;"
1101,ROSAMUND.,A token she was true e'en to the end.
1102,ROSAMUND.,"What matter'd now? But whom to send, and how"
1103,ROSAMUND.,"To reach the man? I found an old poor priest,"
1104,ROSAMUND.,"Some peril 't was for him and me, she writ"
1105,ROSAMUND.,"My pretty Rosamund her heart's farewell,"
1106,ROSAMUND.,"She kissed the letter, and that old poor priest,"
1107,ROSAMUND.,"Who had eaten of my bread, and shelter'd him"
1108,ROSAMUND.,"Under my roof in troublous times, he took,"
1109,ROSAMUND.,"And to content her on this errand went,"
1110,ROSAMUND.,While she as done with earth did wait the end.
1111,ROSAMUND.,
1112,ROSAMUND.,Mankind bemoan them on the bitterness
1113,ROSAMUND.,"Of death. Nay, rather let them chide the grief"
1114,ROSAMUND.,"Of living, chide the waste of mother-love"
1115,ROSAMUND.,For babes that joy to get away to God;
1116,ROSAMUND.,The waste of work and moil and thought and thrift
1117,ROSAMUND.,"And father-love for sons that heed it not,"
1118,ROSAMUND.,"And daughters lost and gone. Ay, let them chide"
1119,ROSAMUND.,These. Yet I chide not. That which I have done
1120,ROSAMUND.,Was rightly done; and what thereon befell
1121,ROSAMUND.,"Could make no right a wrong, e'en were 't to do"
1122,ROSAMUND.,Again.
1123,ROSAMUND.,"I will be brief. The days drag on,"
1124,ROSAMUND.,"My soul forebodes her death, my lonely age."
1125,ROSAMUND.,Once I despondent in the moaning wood
1126,ROSAMUND.,"Look out, and lo a caravel at sea,"
1127,ROSAMUND.,"A man that climbs the rock, and presently"
1128,ROSAMUND.,The Spaniard!
1129,ROSAMUND.,"I did greet him, proud no more."
1130,ROSAMUND.,"He had braved durance, as I knew, ay death,"
1131,ROSAMUND.,To land on th' Island soil. In broken words
1132,ROSAMUND.,Of English he did ask me how she fared.
1133,ROSAMUND.,"Quoth I, 'She is dying, Spaniard; Rosamund"
1134,ROSAMUND.,"My girl will die;' but he is fain, saith he,"
1135,ROSAMUND.,"To talk with her, and all his mind to speak;"
1136,ROSAMUND.,"I answer, 'Ay, my whilome enemy,"
1137,ROSAMUND.,"But she is dying.' 'Nay, now nay,' quoth he,"
1138,ROSAMUND.,"'So be she liveth,' and he moved me yet"
1139,ROSAMUND.,"For answer; then quoth I, 'Come life, come death,"
1140,ROSAMUND.,"What thou wilt, say.'"
1141,ROSAMUND.,Soon made we Rosamund
1142,ROSAMUND.,"Aware, she lying on the settle, wan"
1143,ROSAMUND.,"As a lily in the shade, and while she not"
1144,ROSAMUND.,"Believed for marvelling, comes he roundly in,"
1145,ROSAMUND.,"The tall grave Spaniard, and with but one smile,"
1146,ROSAMUND.,"One look of ruth upon her small pale face,"
1147,ROSAMUND.,"All slowly as with unaccustom'd mouth,"
1148,ROSAMUND.,"Betakes him to that English he hath conned,"
1149,ROSAMUND.,Setting the words out plain:
1150,ROSAMUND.,'Child! Rosamund!
1151,ROSAMUND.,"Love! An so please thee, I would be thy man."
1152,ROSAMUND.,By all the saints will I be good to thee.
1153,ROSAMUND.,Come.'
1154,ROSAMUND.,"Come! what think you, would she come? Ay, ay."
1155,ROSAMUND.,"They love us, but our love is not their life."
1156,ROSAMUND.,For the dark mariner's love lived Rosamund.
1157,ROSAMUND.,"Soon for his kiss she bloomed, smiled for his smile."
1158,ROSAMUND.,"(The Spaniard reaped e'en as th' Evangel saith,"
1159,ROSAMUND.,And bore in 's bosom forth my golden sheaf.)
1160,ROSAMUND.,"She loved her father and her mother well,"
1161,ROSAMUND.,But loved the Spaniard better. It was sad
1162,ROSAMUND.,"To part, but she did part; and it was far"
1163,ROSAMUND.,"To go, but she did go. The priest was brought,"
1164,ROSAMUND.,"The ring was bless'd that bound my Rosamund,"
1165,ROSAMUND.,"She sailed, and I shall never see her more."
1166,ROSAMUND.,
1167,ROSAMUND.,"One soweth and another reapeth. Ay,"
1168,ROSAMUND.,Too true! too true!
1169,ROSAMUND.,
1170,ROSAMUND.,
1171,ROSAMUND.,
1172,ROSAMUND.,
1173,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,ECHO AND THE FERRY.
1174,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1175,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1176,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Ay, Oliver! I was but seven, and he was eleven;"
1177,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,He looked at me pouting and rosy. I blushed where I stood.
1178,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,They had told us to play in the orchard (and I only seven!
1179,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"A small guest at the farm); but he said, 'Oh, a girl was no good!'"
1180,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"So he whistled and went, he went over the stile to the wood."
1181,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"It was sad, it was sorrowful! Only a girl--only seven!"
1182,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,At home in the dark London smoke I had not found it out.
1183,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"The pear-trees looked on in their white, and blue birds flash'd about,"
1184,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,And they too were angry as Oliver. Were they eleven?
1185,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"I thought so. Yes, everyone else was eleven--eleven!"
1186,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1187,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"So Oliver went, but the cowslips were tall at my feet,"
1188,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,And all the white orchard with fast-falling blossom was litter'd;
1189,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And under and over the branches those little birds twitter'd,"
1190,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,While hanging head downwards they scolded because I was seven.
1191,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,A pity. A very great pity. One should be eleven.
1192,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1193,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"But soon I was happy, the smell of the world was so sweet,"
1194,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,And I saw a round hole in an apple-tree rosy and old.
1195,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Then I knew! for I peeped, and I felt it was right they should scold!"
1196,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Eggs small and eggs many. For gladness I broke into laughter;
1197,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And then some one else--oh, how softly!--came after, came after"
1198,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,With laughter--with laughter came after.
1199,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1200,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And no one was near us to utter that sweet mocking call,"
1201,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,That soon very tired sank low with a mystical fall.
1202,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,But this was the country--perhaps it was close under heaven;
1203,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Oh, nothing so likely; the voice might have come from it even."
1204,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"I knew about heaven. But this was the country, of this"
1205,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Light, blossom, and piping, and flashing of wings not at all."
1206,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Not at all. No. But one little bird was an easy forgiver:
1207,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"She peeped, she drew near as I moved from her domicile small,"
1208,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Then flashed down her hole like a dart--like a dart from the quiver.
1209,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,And I waded atween the long grasses and felt it was bliss.
1210,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1211,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,--So this was the country; clear dazzle of azure and shiver
1212,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And whisper of leaves, and a humming all over the tall"
1213,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"White branches, a humming of bees. And I came to the wall--"
1214,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"A little low wall--and looked over, and there was the river,"
1215,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"The lane that led on to the village, and then the sweet river"
1216,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Clear shining and slow, she had far far to go from her snow;"
1217,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"But each rush gleamed a sword in the sunlight to guard her long flow,"
1218,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And she murmur'd, methought, with a speech very soft--very low."
1219,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"'The ways will be long, but the days will be long,' quoth the river,"
1220,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"'To me a long liver, long, long!' quoth the river--the river."
1221,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1222,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"I dreamed of the country that night, of the orchard, the sky,"
1223,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,The voice that had mocked coming after and over and under.
1224,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,But at last--in a day or two namely--Eleven and I
1225,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Were very fast friends, and to him I confided the wonder."
1226,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,He said that was Echo. 'Was Echo a wise kind of bee
1227,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,That had learned how to laugh: could it laugh in one's ear and then fly
1228,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,And laugh again yonder?' 'No; Echo'--he whispered it low--
1229,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"'Was a woman, they said, but a woman whom no one could see"
1230,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And no one could find; and he did not believe it, not he,"
1231,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,But he could not get near for the river that held us asunder.
1232,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Yet I that had money--a shilling, a whole silver shilling--"
1233,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"We might cross if I thought I would spend it.' 'Oh yes, I was willing'--"
1234,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And we ran hand in hand, we ran down to the ferry, the ferry,"
1235,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,And we heard how she mocked at the folk with a voice clear and merry
1236,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,When they called for the ferry; but oh! she was very--was very
1237,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Swift-footed. She spoke and was gone; and when Oliver cried,"
1238,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,'Hie over! hie over! you man of the ferry--the ferry!'
1239,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,By the still water's side she was heard far and wide--she replied
1240,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And she mocked in her voice sweet and merry, 'You man of the ferry,"
1241,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,You man of--you man of the ferry!'
1242,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1243,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"'Hie over!' he shouted. The ferryman came at his calling,"
1244,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Across the clear reed-border'd river he ferried us fast;--
1245,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Such a chase! Hand in hand, foot to foot, we ran on; it surpass'd"
1246,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"All measure her doubling--so close, then so far away falling,"
1247,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Then gone, and no more. Oh! to see her but once unaware,"
1248,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And the mouth that had mocked, but we might not (yet sure she was there!),"
1249,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Nor behold her wild eyes and her mystical countenance fair.
1250,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1251,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"We sought in the wood, and we found the wood-wren in her stead;"
1252,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"In the field, and we found but the cuckoo that talked overhead;"
1253,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"By the brook, and we found the reed-sparrow deep-nested, in brown--"
1254,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Not Echo, fair Echo! for Echo, sweet Echo! was flown."
1255,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,So we came to the place where the dead people wait till God call.
1256,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"The church was among them, grey moss over roof, over wall."
1257,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Very silent, so low. And we stood on a green grassy mound"
1258,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And looked in at a window, for Echo, perhaps, in her round"
1259,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Might have come in to hide there. But no; every oak-carven seat
1260,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Was empty. We saw the great Bible--old, old, very old,"
1261,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,And the parson's great Prayer-book beside it; we heard the slow beat
1262,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Of the pendulum swing in the tower; we saw the clear gold
1263,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Of a sunbeam float down to the aisle and then waver and play
1264,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"On the low chancel step and the railing, and Oliver said,"
1265,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"'Look, Katie! look, Katie! when Lettice came here to be wed"
1266,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"She stood where that sunbeam drops down, and all white was her gown;"
1267,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,And she stepped upon flowers they strew'd for her.' Then quoth small Seven:
1268,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,'Shall I wear a white gown and have flowers to walk upon ever?'
1269,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"All doubtful: 'It takes a long time to grow up,' quoth Eleven;"
1270,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"'You're so little, you know, and the church is so old, it can never"
1271,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Last on till you're tall.' And in whispers--because it was old
1272,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And holy, and fraught with strange meaning, half felt, but not told,"
1273,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Full of old parsons' prayers, who were dead, of old days, of old folk,"
1274,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Neither heard nor beheld, but about us, in whispers we spoke."
1275,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Then we went from it softly and ran hand in hand to the strand,"
1276,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,While bleating of flocks and birds' piping made sweeter the land.
1277,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"And Echo came back e'en as Oliver drew to the ferry,"
1278,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"'O Katie!' 'O Katie!' 'Come on, then!' 'Come on, then!' 'For, see,"
1279,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"The round sun, all red, lying low by the tree'--'by the tree.'"
1280,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"'By the tree.' Ay, she mocked him again, with her voice sweet and merry:"
1281,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,'Hie over!' 'Hie over!' 'You man of the ferry'--'the ferry.'
1282,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,'You man of the ferry--
1283,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,You man of--you man of--the ferry.'
1284,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,
1285,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Ay, here--it was here that we woke her, the Echo of old;"
1286,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"All life of that day seems an echo, and many times told."
1287,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Shall I cross by the ferry to-morrow, and come in my white"
1288,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,To that little low church? and will Oliver meet me anon?
1289,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Will it all seem an echo from childhood pass'd over--pass'd on?
1290,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Will the grave parson bless us? Hark, hark! in the dim failing light"
1291,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"I hear her! As then the child's voice clear and high, sweet and merry"
1292,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Now she mocks the man's tone with 'Hie over! Hie over the ferry!'
1293,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"'And, Katie.' 'And, Katie.' 'Art out with the glow-worms to-night,"
1294,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,My Katie?' 'My Katie?' For gladness I break into laughter
1295,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,And tears. Then it all comes again as from far-away years;
1296,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,"Again, some one else--oh, how softly!--with laughter comes after,"
1297,ECHO AND THE FERRY.,Comes after--with laughter comes after.

2771,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Man's past to feed the air and move the sea;
2772,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Ages of toil make English furrows dear,"
2773,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Enriched by blood shed for his liberty,"
2774,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Sacred by love's first sigh and life's last fear,"
2775,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"We come of a good nest, for it shall yearn"
2776,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Poor birds of passage, but may not return,"
2777,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2778,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Spread younger wings, and beat the winds afar."
2779,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,There sing more poets in that one small isle
2780,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Than all isles else can show--of such you are;
2781,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Remote things come to you unsought erewhile,"
2782,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Near things a long way round as by a star.
2783,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Wild dreams!' He laughed, 'A sage right infantile;"
2784,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With sacred fear behold life's waste deplored,"
2785,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Undaunted by the leisure of the Lord.
2786,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2787,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Ay go, the island dream with eyes make good,"
2788,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Where Freedom rose, a lodestar to your race;"
2789,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And Hope that leaning on her anchor stood
2790,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Did smile it to her feet: a right small place.
2791,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Call her a mother, high such motherhood,"
2792,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Home in her name and duty in her face;
2793,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Call her a ship, her wide arms rake the clouds,"
2794,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And every wind of God pipes in her shrouds.
2795,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2796,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Ay, all the more go you. But some have cried"
2797,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"""The ship is breaking up;"" they watch amazed"
2798,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,While urged toward the rocks by some that guide;
2799,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Bad steering, reckless steering, she all dazed"
2800,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Tempteth her doom; yet this have none denied
2801,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Ships men have wrecked and palaces have razed,"
2802,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But never was it known beneath the sun,"
2803,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,They of such wreckage built a goodlier one.
2804,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2805,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"God help old England an't be thus, nor less"
2806,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"God help the world.' Therewith my mother spake,"
2807,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Perhaps He will! by time, by faithlessness,"
2808,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"By the world's want long in the dark awake,"
2809,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I think He must be almost due: the stress
2810,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Of the great tide of life, sharp misery's ache,"
2811,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,In a recluseness of the soul we rue
2812,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Far off, but yet--He must be almost due."
2813,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2814,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"God manifest again, the coming King.'"
2815,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Then said my father, 'I beheld erewhile,"
2816,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Sitting up dog-like to the sunrising,"
2817,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The giant doll in ruins by the Nile,"
2818,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With hints of red that yet to it doth cling,"
2819,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Fell, battered, and bewigged its cheeks were vile,"
2820,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A body of evil with its angel fled,"
2821,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Whom and his fellow fiends men worshipped.
2822,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2823,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The gods die not, long shrouded on their biers,"
2824,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Somewhere they live, and live in memory yet;"
2825,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Were not the Israelites for forty years
2826,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Hid from them in the desert to forget--
2827,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Did they forget? no more than their lost feres
2828,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Sons of to-day with faces southward set,"
2829,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Who dig for buried lore long ages fled,"
2830,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And sift for it the sand and search the dead.
2831,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2832,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Brown Egypt gave not one great poet birth,"
2833,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But man was better than his gods, with lay"
2834,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"He soothed them restless, and they zoned the earth,"
2835,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And crossed the sea; there drank immortal praise;
2836,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Then from his own best self with glory and worth
2837,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And beauty dowered he them for dateless days.
2838,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Ever ""their sound goes forth"" from shore to shore,"
2839,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,When was there known an hour that they lived more.
2840,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2841,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Because they are beloved and not believed,"
2842,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Admired not feared, they draw men to their feet;"
2843,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"All once, rejected, nothing now, received"
2844,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Where once found wanting, now the most complete;"
2845,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Man knows to-day, though manhood stand achieved,"
2846,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,His cradle-rockers made a rustling sweet;
2847,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That king reigns longest which did lose his crown,"
2848,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Stars that by poets shine are stars gone down.
2849,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2850,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Still drawn obedient to an unseen hand,"
2851,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"From purer heights comes down the yearning west,"
2852,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Like to that eagle in the morning land,"
2853,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That swooping on her predatory quest,"
2854,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Did from the altar steal a smouldering brand,"
2855,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The which she bearing home it burned her nest,"
2856,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And her wide pinions of their plumes bereaven.
2857,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Spoiled for glad spiring up the steeps of heaven.
2858,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2859,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I say the gods live, and that reign abhor,"
2860,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And will the nations it should dawn? Will they
2861,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Who ride upon the perilous edge of war?
2862,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Will such as delve for gold in this our day?
2863,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Neither the world will, nor the age will, nor"
2864,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The soul--and what, it cometh now? Nay, nay,"
2865,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The weighty sphere, unready for release,"
2866,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Rolls far in front of that o'ermastering peace.
2867,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2868,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Wait and desire it; life waits not, free there"
2869,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To good, to evil, thy right perilous--"
2870,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"All shall be fair, and yet it is not fair."
2871,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I thank my God He takes th'advantage thus;
2872,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"He doth not greatly hide, but still declare"
2873,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Which side He is on and which He loves, to us,"
2874,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"While life impartial aid to both doth lend,"
2875,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And heed not which the choice nor what the end.
2876,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2877,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Among the few upright, O to be found,"
2878,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And ever search the nobler path, my son,"
2879,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Nor say 'tis sweet to find me common ground
2880,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Too high, too good, shall leave the hours alone--"
2881,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Nay, though but one stood on the height renowned,"
2882,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Deny not hope or will, to be that one."
2883,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Is it the many fall'n shall lift the land,"
2884,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The race, the age!--Nay, 't is the few that stand.'"
2885,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2886,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"While in the lamplight hearkening I sat mute,"
2887,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Methought 'How soon this fire must needs burn out'
2888,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Among the passion flowers and passion fruit
2889,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That from the wide verandah hung, misdoubt"
2890,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Was mine. 'And wherefore made I thus long suit
2891,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To leave this old white head? His words devout,"
2892,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,His blessing not to hear who loves me so--
2893,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"He that is old, right old--I will not go.'"
2894,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2895,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But ere the dawn their counsels wrought with me,"
2896,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And I went forth; alas that I so went
2897,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Under the great gum-forest canopy,"
2898,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The light on every silken filament
2899,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Of every flower, a quivering ecstasy"
2900,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Of perfect paleness made it; sunbeams sent
2901,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Up to the leaves with sword-like flash endued
2902,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Each turn of that grey drooping multitude.
2903,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2904,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I sought to look as in the light of one
2905,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Returned. 'Will this be strange to me that day?
2906,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Flocks of green parrots clamorous in the sun
2907,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Tearing out milky maize--stiff cacti grey
2908,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"As old men's beards--here stony ranges lone,"
2909,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Their dust of mighty flocks upon their way
2910,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To water, cloudlike on the bush afar,"
2911,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Like smoke that hangs where old-world cities are.
2912,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2913,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Is it not made man's last endowment here
2914,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To find a beauty in the wilderness;
2915,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Feel the lorn moor above his pastures dear,"
2916,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Mountains that may not house and will not bless
2917,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To draw him even to death? He must insphere
2918,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"His spirit in the open, so doth less"
2919,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Desire his feres, and more that unvex'd wold"
2920,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And fine afforested hills, his dower of old."
2921,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2922,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But shall we lose again that new-found sense
2923,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Which sees the earth less for our tillage fair?
2924,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Oh, let her speak with her best eloquence"
2925,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To me, but not her first and her right rare"
2926,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Can equal what I may not take from hence.
2927,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The gems are left: it is not otherwhere
2928,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The wild Nepèan cleaves her matchless way,"
2929,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Nor Sydney harbour shall outdo the day.
2930,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2931,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Adding to day this--that she lighteth it.'
2932,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But I beheld again, and as must be"
2933,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With a world-record by a spirit writ,"
2934,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"It was more beautiful than memory,"
2935,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Than hope was more complete.
2936,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Tall brigs did sit
2937,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Each in her berth the pure flood placidly,"
2938,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Their topsails drooping 'neath the vast blue dome
2939,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Listless, as waiting to be sheeted home."
2940,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2941,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And the great ships with pulse-like throbbing clear,"
2942,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Majestical of mien did take their way
2943,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Like living creatures from some grander sphere,"
2944,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That having boarded ours thought good to stay,"
2945,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Albeit enslaved. They most divided here
2946,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"From God's great art and all his works in clay,"
2947,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"In that their beauty lacks, though fair it shows"
2948,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,That divine waste of beauty only He bestows.
2949,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2950,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The day was young, scarce out the harbour lights"
2951,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,That morn I sailed: low sun-rays tremulous
2952,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,On golden loops sped outward. Yachts in flights
2953,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Flutter'd the water air-like clear, while thus"
2954,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,It crept for shade among brown rocky bights
2955,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With cassia crowned and palms diaphanous,"
2956,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And boughs ripe fruitage dropping fitfully,"
2957,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,That on the shining ebb went out to sea.
2958,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2959,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Home,' saith the man self-banished, 'my son"
2960,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Shall now go home.' Therewith he sendeth him
2961,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Abroad, and knows it not, but thence is won,"
2962,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Rescued, the son's true home. His mind doth limn"
2963,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Beautiful pictures of it, there is none"
2964,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"So dear, a new thought shines erewhile but dim,"
2965,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'That was my home, a land past all compare,"
2966,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Life, and the poetry of life, are there.'"
2967,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2968,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But no such thought drew near to me that day;
2969,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"All the new worlds flock forth to greet the old,"
2970,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"All the young souls bow down to own its sway,"
2971,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Enamoured of strange richness manifold;
2972,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Not to be stored, albeit they seek for aye,"
2973,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Besieging it for its own life to hold,"
2974,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"E'en as Al Mamoun fain for treasures hid,"
2975,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Stormed with an host th' inviolate pyramid.
2976,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2977,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And went back foiled but wise to walled Bagdad.
2978,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"So I, so all. The treasure sought not found,"
2979,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But some divine tears found to superadd
2980,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Themselves to a long story. The great round
2981,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Of yesterdays, their pathos sweet as sad,"
2982,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Found to be only as to-day, close bound"
2983,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With us, we hope some good thing yet to know,"
2984,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But God is not in haste, while the lambs grow"
2985,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2986,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The Shepherd leadeth softly. It is great
2987,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The journey, and the flock forgets at last"
2988,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,(Earth ever working to obliterate
2989,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The landmarks) when it halted, where it passed;"
2990,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And words confuse, and time doth ruinate,"
2991,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And memory fail to hold a theme so vast;
2992,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"There is request for light, but the flock feeds,"
2993,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And slowly ever on the Shepherd leads.
2994,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
2995,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Home,' quoth my father, and a glassy sea"
2996,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Made for the stars a mirror of its breast,"
2997,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"While southing, pennon-like, in bravery"
2998,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Of long drawn gold they trembled to their rest.
2999,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Strange the first night and morn, when Destiny"
3000,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Spread out to float on, all the mind oppressed;"
3001,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Strange on their outer roof to speed forth thus,"
3002,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And know th' uncouth sea-beasts stared up at us.
3003,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3004,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But yet more strange the nights of falling rain,"
3005,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,That splashed without--a sea-coal fire within;
3006,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Life's old things gone astern, the mind's disdain,"
3007,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,For murmurous London makes soft rhythmic din.
3008,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,All courtier thoughts that wait on words would fain
3009,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Express that sound. The words are not to win
3010,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Till poet made, but mighty, yet so mild"
3011,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Shall be as cooing of a cradle-child.
3012,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3013,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Sensation like a piercing arrow flies,"
3014,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Daily out-going thought. This Adamhood,"
3015,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,This weltering river of mankind that hies
3016,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Adown the street; it cannot be withstood.
3017,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The richest mundane miles not otherwise
3018,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Than by a symbol keep possession good,"
3019,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Mere symbol of division, and they hold"
3020,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The clear pane sacred, the unminted gold"
3021,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3022,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And wild outpouring of all wealth not less.
3023,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Why this? A million strong the multitude,"
3024,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And safe, far safer than our wilderness"
3025,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The walls; for them it daunts with right at feud,"
3026,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Itself declares for law; yet sore the stress
3027,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"On steeps of life: what power to ban and bless,"
3028,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Saintly denial, waste inglorious,"
3029,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Desperate want, and riches fabulous."
3030,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3031,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Of souls what beautiful embodiment
3032,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,For some; for some what homely housing writ;
3033,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,What keen-eyed men who beggared of content
3034,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Eat bread well earned as they had stolen it;
3035,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"What flutterers after joy that forward went,"
3036,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And left them in the rear unqueened, unfit"
3037,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"For joy, with light that faints in strugglings drear"
3038,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Of all things good the most awanting here.
3039,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3040,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Some in the welter of this surging tide
3041,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Move like the mystic lamps, the Spirits Seven,"
3042,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Their burning love runs kindling far and wide,"
3043,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That fire they needed not to steal from heaven,"
3044,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Twas a free gift flung down with them to bide,"
3045,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And be a comfort for the hearts bereaven,"
3046,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A warmth, a glow, to make the failing store"
3047,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And parsimony of emotion more.
3048,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3049,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"What glorious dreams in that find harbourage,"
3050,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The phantom of a crime stalks this beside,"
3051,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And those might well have writ on some past page,"
3052,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"In such an hour, of such a year, we--died,"
3053,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Put out our souls, took the mean way, false wage,"
3054,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Course cowardly; and if we be denied
3055,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The life once loved, we cannot alway rue"
3056,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The loss; let be: what vails so sore ado.
3057,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3058,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And faces pass of such as give consent
3059,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To live because 'tis not worth while to die;
3060,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,This never knew the awful tremblement
3061,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"When some great fear sprang forward suddenly,"
3062,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Its other name being hope--and there forthwent
3063,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,As both confronted him a rueful cry
3064,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"From the heart's core, one urging him to dare,"
3065,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Now! now! Leap now.' The other, 'Stand, forbear.'"
3066,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3067,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A nation reared in brick. How shall this be?
3068,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Nor by excess of life death overtake.
3069,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To die in brick of brick her destiny,"
3070,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And as the hamadryad eats the snake
3071,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"His wife, and then the snake his son, so she"
3072,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Air not enough, 'though everyone doth take"
3073,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A little,' water scant, a plague of gold,"
3074,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Light out of date--a multitude born old.
3075,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3076,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And then a three-day siege might be the end;
3077,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,E'en now the rays get muddied struggling down
3078,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Through heaven's vasty lofts, and still extend"
3079,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The miles of brick and none forbid, and none"
3080,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Forbode; a great world-wonder that doth send
3081,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"High fame abroad, and fear no setting sun,"
3082,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But helpless she through wealth that flouts the day
3083,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And through her little children, even as they."
3084,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3085,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But forth of London, and all visions dear"
3086,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To eastern poets of a watered land
3087,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Are made the commonplace of nature here,"
3088,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Sweet rivers always full, and always bland."
3089,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Beautiful, beautiful! What runlets clear"
3090,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Twinkle among the grass. On every hand
3091,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Fall in the common talk from lips around
3092,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The old names of old towns and famous ground.
3093,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3094,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"It is not likeness only charms the sense,"
3095,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Not difference only sets the mind aglow,"
3096,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"It is the likeness in the difference,"
3097,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Familiar language spoken on the snow,"
3098,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To have the Perfect in the Present tense,"
3099,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To hear the ploughboy whistling, and to know,"
3100,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"It smacks of the wild bush, that tune--'Tis ours,"
3101,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And look! the bank is pale with primrose flowers,"
3102,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3103,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"What veils of tender mist make soft the lea,"
3104,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,What bloom of air the height; no veils confer
3105,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,On warring thought or softness or degree
3106,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Or rest. Still falling, conquering, strife and stir."
3107,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,For this religion pays indemnity.
3108,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,She pays her enemies for conquering her.
3109,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And then her friends; while ever, and in vain"
3110,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Lots for a seamless coat are cast again.
3111,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3112,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Whose it shall be; unless it shall endow
3113,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Thousands of thousands it can fall to none,"
3114,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But faith and hope are not so simple now,"
3115,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,As in the year of our redemption--One.
3116,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The pencil of pure light must disallow
3117,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Its name and scattering, many hues put on,"
3118,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And faith and hope low in the valley feel,"
3119,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"There it is well with them, 'tis very well."
3120,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3121,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The land is full of vision, voices call."
3122,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Can spirits cast a shadow? Ay, I trow"
3123,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Past is not done, and over is not all,"
3124,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Opinion dies to live and wanes to grow,"
3125,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The gossamer of thought doth filmlike fall,"
3126,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"On fallows after dawn make shimmering show,"
3127,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And with old arrow-heads, her earliest prize,"
3128,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Mix learning's latest guess and last surmise.
3129,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3130,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"There heard I pipes of fame, saw wrens 'about"
3131,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That time when kings go forth to battle' dart,"
3132,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Full valorous atoms pierced with song, and stout"
3133,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To dare, and down yclad; I shared the smart"
3134,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Of grievèd cushats, bloom of love, devout"
3135,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Beyond man's thought of it. Old song my heart
3136,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Rejoiced, but O mine own forelders' ways"
3137,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To look on, and their fashions of past days."
3138,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3139,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The ponderous craft of arms I craved to see,"
3140,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Knights, burghers, filtering through those gates ajar,"
3141,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Their age of serfdom with my spirit free;
3142,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,We cannot all have wisdom; some there are
3143,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Believe a star doth rule their destiny,"
3144,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And yet they think to overreach the star,"
3145,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"For thought can weld together things apart,"
3146,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And contraries find meeting in the heart.
3147,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3148,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,In the deep dust at Suez without sound
3149,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I saw the Arab children walk at eve,"
3150,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Their dark untroubled eyes upon the ground,"
3151,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A part of Time's grave quiet. I receive
3152,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Since then a sense, as nature might have found"
3153,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Love kin to man's that with the past doth grieve;
3154,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And lets on waste and dust of ages fall
3155,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Her tender silences that mean it all.
3156,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3157,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"We have it of her, with her; it were ill"
3158,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"For men, if thought were widowed of the world,"
3159,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Or the world beggared of her sons, for still"
3160,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A crownèd sphere with many gems impearled
3161,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,She rolls because of them. We lend her will
3162,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And she yields love. The past shall not be hurled
3163,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"In the abhorred limbo while the twain,"
3164,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Mother and son, hold partnership and reign."
3165,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3166,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"She hangs out omens, and doth burdens dree."
3167,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Is she in league with heaven? That knows but One.
3168,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"For man is not, and yet his work we see"
3169,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Full of unconscious omen darkly done.
3170,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I saw the ring-stone wrought at Avebury
3171,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To frame the face of the midwinter sun,"
3172,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Good luck that hour they thought from him forth smiled
3173,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,At midwinter the Sun did rise--the Child.
3174,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3175,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Still would the world divine though man forbore,"
3176,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And what is beauty but an omen?--what
3177,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But life's deep divination cast before,"
3178,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Omen of coming love? Hard were man's lot,"
3179,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With love and toil together at his door,"
3180,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But all-convincing eyes hath beauty got;
3181,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"His love is beautiful, and he shall sue."
3182,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Toil for her sake is sweet, the omen true."
3183,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3184,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Love, love, and come it must, then life is found"
3185,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Beforehand that was whole and fronting care,"
3186,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A torn and broken half in durance bound
3187,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,That mourns and makes request for its right fair
3188,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Remainder, with forlorn eyes cast around"
3189,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To search for what is lost, that unaware"
3190,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,With not an hour's forebodement makes the day
3191,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,From henceforth less or more for ever and aye.
3192,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3193,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Her name--my love's--I knew it not; who says
3194,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Of vagrant doubt for such a cause that stirs
3195,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,His fancy shall not pay arrearages
3196,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To all sweet names that might perhaps be hers?
3197,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The doubts of love are powers. His heart obeys,"
3198,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The world is in them, still to love defers,"
3199,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Will play with him for love, but when 't begins"
3200,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The play is high, and the world always wins."
3201,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3202,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"For 'tis the maiden's world, and his no more."
3203,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Now thus it was: with new found kin flew by
3204,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The temperate summer; every wheatfield wore
3205,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Its gold, from house to house in ardency"
3206,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Of heart for what they showed I westward bore--
3207,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"My mother's land, her native hills drew nigh;"
3208,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I was--how green, how good old earth can be--"
3209,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Beholden to that land for teaching me.
3210,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3211,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And parted from my fellows, and went on"
3212,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To feel the spiritual sadness spread
3213,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Adown long pastoral hollows. And anon
3214,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Did words recur in far remoteness said:
3215,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'See the deep vale ere dews are dried and gone,"
3216,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Where my so happy life in peace I led,"
3217,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And the great shadow of the Beacon lies--
3218,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,See little Ledbury trending up the rise.
3219,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3220,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,With peakèd houses and high market hall--
3221,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,An oak each pillar--reared in the old days.
3222,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And here was little Ledbury, quaint withal,"
3223,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The forest felled, her lair and sheltering place"
3224,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,She long time left in age pathetical.
3225,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Great oaks' methought, as I drew near to gaze,"
3226,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Were but of small account when these came down,"
3227,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Drawn rough-hewn in to serve the tree-girt town.
3228,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3229,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And thus and thus of it will question be
3230,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The other side the world.' I paused awhile
3231,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To mark. 'The old hall standeth utterly
3232,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Without or floor or side, a comely pile,"
3233,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A house on pillars, and by destiny"
3234,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Drawn under its deep roof I saw a file
3235,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Of children slowly through their way make good,"
3236,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And lifted up mine eyes--and there--SHE STOOD.
3237,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3238,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,She was so stately that her youthful grace
3239,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Drew out, it seemed, my soul unto the air,"
3240,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Astonished out of breathing by her face
3241,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,So fain to nest itself in nut-brown hair
3242,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Lying loose about her throat. But that old place
3243,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Proved sacred, she just fully grown too fair"
3244,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,For such a thought. The dimples that she had!
3245,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,She was so truly sweet that it was sad.
3246,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3247,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I was all hers. That moment gave her power--
3248,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And whom, nay what she was, I scarce might know,"
3249,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But felt I had been born for that good hour.
3250,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The perfect creature did not move, but so"
3251,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,As if ordained to claim all grace for dower.
3252,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"She leaned against the pillar, and below"
3253,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Three almost babes, her care, she watched the while"
3254,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,With downcast lashes and a musing smile.
3255,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3256,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I had been 'ware without a rustic treat,"
3257,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Waggons bedecked with greenery stood anigh,"
3258,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A swarm of children in the cheerful street
3259,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,With girls to marshal them; but all went by
3260,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And none I noted save this only sweet:
3261,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Too young her charge more venturous sport to try,"
3262,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With whirling baubles still they play content,"
3263,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And softly rose their lisping babblement.
3264,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3265,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'O what a pause! to be so near, to mark"
3266,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The locket rise and sink upon her breast;
3267,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The shadow of the lashes lieth dark
3268,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Upon her cheek. O fleeting time, O rest!"
3269,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A slant ray finds the gold, and with a spark"
3270,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And flash it answers, now shall be the best."
3271,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Her eyes she raises, sets their light on mine,"
3272,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,They do not flash nor sparkle--no--but shine.'
3273,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3274,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,As I for very hopelessness made bold
3275,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Did off my hat ere time there was for thought,"
3276,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"She with a gracious sweetness, calm, not cold,"
3277,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Acknowledged me, but brought my chance to nought"
3278,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'This vale of imperfection doth not hold
3279,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A lovelier bud among its loveliest wrought!
3280,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"She turns,' methought 'O do not quite forget"
3281,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To me remains for ever--that we met.'
3282,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3283,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And straightway I went forth, I could no less,"
3284,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Another light unwot of fall'n on me,"
3285,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And rare elation and high happiness
3286,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Some mighty power set hands of mastery
3287,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Among my heartstrings, and they did confess"
3288,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With wild throbs inly sweet, that minstrelsy"
3289,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A nightingale might dream so rich a strain,"
3290,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And pine to change her song for sleep again.
3291,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3292,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The harp thrilled ever: O with what a round
3293,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And series of rich pangs fled forth each note
3294,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Oracular, that I had found, had found"
3295,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,(Head waters of old Nile held less remote)
3296,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Golden Dorado, dearest, most renowned;"
3297,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But when as 't were a sigh did overfloat,"
3298,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Shaping 'how long, not long shall this endure,"
3299,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"_Au jour le jour'_ methought, _'Aujour le jour'_."
3300,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3301,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The minutes of that hour my heart knew well
3302,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Were like the fabled pint of golden grain,"
3303,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Each to be counted, paid for, till one fell,"
3304,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Grew, shot up to another world amain,"
3305,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And he who dropped might climb it, there to dwell."
3306,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I too, I clomb another world full fain,"
3307,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But was she there? O what would be the end,"
3308,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Might she nor there appear, nor I descend?"
3309,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3310,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,All graceful as a palm the maiden stood;
3311,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Men say the palm of palms in tropic Isles
3312,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Doth languish in her deep primeval wood,"
3313,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And want the voice of man, his home, his smiles,"
3314,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Nor flourish but in his dear neighborhood;
3315,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"She too shall want a voice that reconciles,"
3316,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A smile that charms--how sweet would heaven so please--
3317,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To plant her at my door over far seas.
3318,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3319,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I paced without, nor ever liege in truth"
3320,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,His sovran lady watched with more grave eyes
3321,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Of reverence, and she nothing ware forsooth,"
3322,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Did standing charm the soul with new surprise.
3323,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Moving flow on a dimpled dream of youth.
3324,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Look! look! a sunbeam on her. Ay, but lies"
3325,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The shade more sweetly now she passeth through
3326,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To join her fellow maids returned anew.
3327,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3328,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I saw (myself to bide unmarked intent)
3329,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Their youthful ease and pretty airs sedate,"
3330,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"They are so good, they are so innocent,"
3331,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Those Islanders, they learn their part so late,"
3332,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Of life's demand right careless, dwell content"
3333,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Till the first love's first kiss shall consecrate
3334,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Their future to a world that can but be
3335,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,By their sweet martyrdom and ministry.
3336,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3337,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Most happy of God's creatures. Afterward
3338,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"More than all women married thou wilt be,"
3339,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"E'en to the soul. One glance desired afford,"
3340,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,More than knight's service might'st thou ask of me.
3341,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Not any chance is mine, not the best word,"
3342,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"No, nor the salt of life withouten thee."
3343,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Must this all end, is my day so soon o'er?"
3344,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Untroubled violet eyes, look once,--once more."
3345,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3346,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"No, not a glance: the low sun lay and burned,"
3347,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Now din of drum and cry of fife withal,"
3348,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Blithe teachers mustering frolic swarms returned,"
3349,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And new-world ways in that old market hall,"
3350,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Sweet girls, fair women, how my whole heart yearned"
3351,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Her to draw near who made my festival.
3352,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With others closing round, time speeding on,"
3353,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"How soon she would be gone, she would be gone!"
3354,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3355,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Ay, but I thought to track the rustic wains,"
3356,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Their goal desired to note, but not anigh,"
3357,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,They creaking down long hop ycrested lanes
3358,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'Neath the abiding flush of that north sky.
3359,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I ran, my horse I fetched, but fate ordains"
3360,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Love shall breed laughter when th' unloving spy.
3361,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"As I drew rein to watch the gathered crowd,"
3362,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,With sudden mirth an old wife laughed aloud.
3363,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3364,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Her cheeks like winter apples red of hue,"
3365,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Her glance aside. To whom her speech--to me?
3366,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'I know the thing you go about to do--
3367,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The lady--' 'What! the lady--' 'Sir,' saith she,"
3368,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"('I thank you kindly, sir), I tell you true"
3369,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"She's gone,' and 'here's a coil' methought 'will be.'"
3370,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'Gone--where?' ''Tis past my wit forsooth to say
3371,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,If they went Malvern way or Hereford way.
3372,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3373,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A carriage took her up--where three roads meet
3374,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,They needs must pass; you may o'ertake it yet.'
3375,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And 'Oyez, Oyez' peals adown the street,"
3376,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Lost, lost, a golden heart with pearls beset.'"
3377,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'I know her, sir?--not I. To help this treat,"
3378,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Many strange ladies from the country met.'
3379,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'O heart beset with pearls! my hope was crost.
3380,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Farewell, good dame. Lost! oh my lady lost.'"
3381,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3382,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And 'Oyez, Oyez' following after me"
3383,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,On my great errand to the sundown went.
3384,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Lost, lost, and lost, whenas the cross road flee"
3385,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Up tumbled hills, on each for eyes attent"
3386,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A carriage creepeth.
3387,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3388,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Though in neither she,"
3389,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I ne'er shall know life's worst impoverishment,"
3390,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"An empty heart. No time, I stake my all,"
3391,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To right! and chase the rose-red evenfall.
3392,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3393,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Fly up, good steed, fly on. Take the sharp rise"
3394,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,As't were a plain. A lady sits; but one.
3395,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"So fast the pace she turns in startled wise,"
3396,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,She sets her gaze on mine and all is done.
3397,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"""Persian Roxana"" might have raised such eyes"
3398,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,When Alexander sought her. Now the sun
3399,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Dips, and my day is over; turn and fleet"
3400,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The world fast flies, again do three roads meet.'"
3401,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3402,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I took the left, and for some cause unknown"
3403,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Full fraught of hope and joy the way pursued,"
3404,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Yet chose strong reasons speeding up alone
3405,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To fortify me 'gainst a shock more rude.
3406,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,E'en so the diver carrieth down a stone
3407,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"In hand, lest he float up before he would,"
3408,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And end his walk upon the rich sea-floor,"
3409,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Those pearls he failed to grasp never to look on more.
3410,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3411,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Then as the low moon heaveth, waxen white,"
3412,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The carriage, and it turns into a gate."
3413,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Within sit three in pale pathetic light.
3414,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"O surely one of these my love, my fate."
3415,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But ere I pass they wind away from sight.
3416,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Then cottage casements glimmer. All elate
3417,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I cross a green, there yawns with opened latch"
3418,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A village hostel capped in comely thatch.
3419,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3420,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'The same world made for all is made for each.
3421,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To match a heart's magnificence of hope.
3422,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,How shall good reason best high action teach
3423,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To win of custom, and with home to cope"
3424,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,How warrantably may he hope to win
3425,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A star, that wants it? Shall he lie and grope,"
3426,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"No, truly.--I will see her; tell my tale,"
3427,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"See her this once,--and if I fail--I fail.'"
3428,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3429,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Thus with myself I spoke. A rough brick floor
3430,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Made the place homely; I would rest me there.
3431,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But how to sleep? Forth of the unlocked door
3432,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I passed at midnight, lustreless white air"
3433,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Made strange the hour, that ecstasy not o'er"
3434,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I moved among the shadows, all my care--"
3435,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Counted a shadow--her drawn near to bless,"
3436,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Impassioned out of fear, rapt, motionless."
3437,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3438,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Now a long pool and water-hens at rest
3439,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"(As doughty seafolk dusk, at Malabar)"
3440,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A few pale stars lie trembling on its breast.
3441,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Hath the Most High of all His host afar
3442,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"One most supremely beautiful, one best,"
3443,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Dearest of all the flock, one favourite star?"
3444,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"His Image given, in part the children know"
3445,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,They love one first and best. It may be so.
3446,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3447,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Now a long hedge; here dream the woolly folk;
3448,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A majesty of silence is about.
3449,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Transparent mist rolls off the pool like smoke,"
3450,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And Time is in his trance and night devout.
3451,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Now the still house. O an I knew she woke
3452,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I could not look, the sacred moon sheds out"
3453,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"So many blessings on her rooftree low,"
3454,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Each more pathetic that she nought doth know.
3455,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3456,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I would not love a little, nor my start"
3457,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Make with the multitude that love and cease.
3458,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"He gives too much that giveth half a heart,"
3459,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Too much for liberty, too much for peace."
3460,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Let me the first and best and highest impart,"
3461,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The whole of it, and heaven the whole increase!"
3462,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,For _that_ were not too much.
3463,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3464,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,(In the moon's wake
3465,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"How the grass glitters, for her sweetest sake.)"
3466,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3467,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I would toward her walk the silver floors.
3468,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Love loathes an average--all extreme things deal
3469,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To love--sea-deep and dazzling height for stores.
3470,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"There are on Fortune's errant foot can steal,"
3471,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Can guide her blindfold in at their own doors,"
3472,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Or dance elate upon her slippery wheel.
3473,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Courage! there are 'gainst hope can still advance,"
3474,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Dowered with a sane, a wise extravagance."
3475,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3476,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A song
3477,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To one a dreaming: when the dew
3478,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Falls, 'tis a time for rest; and when the bird"
3479,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Calls, 'tis a time to wake, to wake for you."
3480,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A long-waking, aye, waking till a word"
3481,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Come from her coral mouth to be the true
3482,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Sum of all good heart wanted, ear hath heard."
3483,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3484,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Yet if alas! might love thy dolour be,"
3485,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Dream, dear heart dear, and do not dream of me."
3486,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3487,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I sing
3488,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To one awakened, when the heart"
3489,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Cries 'tis a day for thought, and when the soul"
3490,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Sighs choose thy part, O choose thy part, thy part."
3491,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I bring to one belovèd, bring my whole"
3492,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Store, make in loving, make O make mine art"
3493,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"More. Yet I ask no, ask no wished goal"
3494,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3495,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But this--if loving might thy dolour be,"
3496,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Wake, O my lady loved, and love not me."
3497,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3498,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'That which the many win, love's niggard sum,"
3499,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I will not, if love's all be left behind."
3500,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That which I am I cannot unbecome,"
3501,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"My past not unpossess, nor future blind."
3502,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Let me all risk, and leave the deep heart dumb"
3503,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"For ever, if that maiden sits enshrined"
3504,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The saint of one more happy. She is she.
3505,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,There is none other. Give her then to me.
3506,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3507,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Or else to be the better for her face
3508,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Beholding it no more.' Then all night through
3509,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The shadow moves with infinite dark grace.
3510,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The light is on her windows, and the dew"
3511,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Comforts the world and me, till in my place"
3512,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"At moonsetting, when stars flash out to view,"
3513,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Comes 'neath the cedar boughs a great repose,"
3514,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The peace of one renouncing, and then a doze."
3515,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3516,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"There was no dream, yet waxed a sense in me"
3517,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Asleep that patience was the better way,"
3518,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Appeasement for a want that needs must be,"
3519,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Grew as the dominant mind forbore its sway,"
3520,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Till whistling sweet stirred in the cedar tree--
3521,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I started--woke--it was the dawn of day.
3522,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That was the end. 'Slow solemn growth of light,"
3523,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Come what come will, remains to me this night.'"
3524,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3525,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"It was the end, with dew ordained to melt,"
3526,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"How easily was learned, how all too soon"
3527,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Not there, not thereabout such maiden dwelt."
3528,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,What was it promised me so fair a boon?
3529,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Heart-hope is not less vain because heart-felt,"
3530,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Gone forth once more in search of her at noon
3531,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Through the sweet country side on hill, on plain,"
3532,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I sought and sought many long days in vain.
3533,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3534,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To Malvern next, with feathery woodland hung,"
3535,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Whereto old Piers the Plowman came to teach,"
3536,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"On her green vasty hills the lay was sung,"
3537,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"He too, it may be, lisping in his speech,"
3538,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'To make the English sweet upon his tongue.'
3539,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"How many maidens beautiful, and each"
3540,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Might him delight, that loved no other fair;"
3541,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But Malvern blessed not me,--she was not there."
3542,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3543,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Then to that town, but still my fate the same."
3544,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Crowned with old works that her right well beseem,"
3545,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To gaze upon her field of ancient fame
3546,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And muse on the sad thrall's most piteous dream,"
3547,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"By whom a 'shadow like an angel came,'"
3548,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Crying out on Clarence, its wild eyes agleam,"
3549,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Accusing echoes here still falter and flee,"
3550,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'That stabbed me on the field by Tewkesbury.'
3551,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3552,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"It nothing 'vailed that yet I sought and sought,"
3553,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Part of my very self was left behind,"
3554,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Till risen in wrath against th' o'ermastering thought,"
3555,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Let me be thankful,' quoth the better mind,"
3556,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Thankful for her, though utterly to nought"
3557,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"She brings my heart's cry, and I live to find"
3558,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A new self of the old self exigent
3559,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,In the light of my divining discontent.
3560,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3561,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The picture of a maiden bidding 'Arise,"
3562,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I am the Art of God. He shows by me
3563,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"His great idea, so well as sin-stained eyes"
3564,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Love aidant can behold it.'
3565,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Is this she?
3566,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Or is it mine own love for her supplies
3567,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The meaning and the power? Howe'er this be,"
3568,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,She is the interpreter by whom most near
3569,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Man's soul is drawn to beauty and pureness here.
3570,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3571,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The sweet idea, invisible hitherto,"
3572,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Is in her face, unconscious delegate;"
3573,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,That thing she wots not of ordained to do:
3574,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"But also it shall be her votary's fate,"
3575,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Through her his early days of ease to eschew,"
3576,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Struggle with life and prove its weary weight.
3577,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"All the great storms that rising rend the soul,"
3578,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Are life in little, imaging the whole."
3579,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3580,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Ay, so as life is, love is, in their ken"
3581,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Stars, infant yet, both thought to grasp, to keep,"
3582,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Then came the morn of passionate splendour, when"
3583,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"So sweet the light, none but for bliss could weep,"
3584,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And then the strife, the toil; but we are men,"
3585,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Strong, brave to battle with the stormy deep;"
3586,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Then fear--and then renunciation--then
3587,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Appeals unto the Infinite Pity--and sleep.
3588,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3589,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But after life the sleep is long. Not so
3590,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"With love. Love buried lieth not straight, not still,"
3591,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Love starts, and after lull awakes to know"
3592,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"All the deep things again. And next his will,"
3593,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That dearest pang is, never to forego."
3594,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"He would all service, hardship, fret fulfill."
3595,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Unhappy love! and I of that great host
3596,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Unhappy love who cry, unhappy most."
3597,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3598,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Because renunciation was so short,"
3599,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The starved heart so easily awaked;
3600,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A dream could do it, a bud, a bird, a thought,"
3601,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But I betook me with that want which ached
3602,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To neighbour lands where strangeness with me wrought.
3603,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The old work was so hale, its fitness slaked"
3604,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Soul-thirst for truth. 'I knew not doubt nor fear,'"
3605,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Its language, 'war or worship, sure sincere.'"
3606,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3607,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Then where by Art the high did best translate
3608,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Life's infinite pathos to the soul, set down"
3609,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Beauty and mystery, that imperious hate"
3610,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"On its best braveness doth and sainthood frown,"
3611,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Nay more the MASTER'S manifest pity--'wait,"
3612,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Behold the palmgrove and the promised crown.
3613,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"He suffers with thee, for thee.--Lo the Child!"
3614,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Comfort thy heart; he certainly so smiled.'
3615,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3616,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Thus love and I wore through the winter time.
3617,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Then saw her demon blush Vesuvius try,"
3618,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Then evil ghosts white from the awful prime,"
3619,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Thrust up sharp peaks to tear the tender sky.
3620,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'No more to do but hear that English chime'
3621,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I to a kinsman wrote. He made reply,"
3622,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'As home I bring my girl and boy full soon,"
3623,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I pass through Evesham,--meet me there at noon."
3624,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3625,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'The bells your father loved you needs must hear,"
3626,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Seek Oxford next with me,' and told the day."
3627,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'Upon the bridge I'll meet you. What! how dear
3628,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Soever was a dream, shall it bear sway"
3629,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,To mar the waking?'
3630,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I set forth, drew near,"
3631,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Beheld a goodly tower, twin churches grey,"
3632,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Evesham. The bridge, and noon. I nothing knew"
3633,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,What to my heart that fateful chime would do.
3634,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3635,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,For suddenly the sweet bells overcame
3636,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A world unsouled; did all with man endow;
3637,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,His yearning almost tell that passeth name
3638,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And said they were full old, and they were now"
3639,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And should be; and their sighing upon the same
3640,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"For our poor sake that pass they did avow,"
3641,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,While on clear Avon flowed like man's short day
3642,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The shining river of life lapsing away.
3643,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3644,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,The stroke of noon. The bell-bird! yes and no.
3645,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Winds of remembrance swept as over the foam
3646,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Of anti-natal shores. At home is it so,"
3647,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"My country folk? Ay, 'neath this pale blue dome,"
3648,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Many of you in the moss lie low--lie low.
3649,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Ah! since I have not HER, give me too, home."
3650,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A footstep near! I turned; past likelihood,"
3651,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Past hope, before me on the bridge--SHE STOOD."
3652,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3653,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A rosy urchin had her hand; this cried,"
3654,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'We think you are our cousin--yes, you are;"
3655,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I said so to Estelle.' The violet-eyed,"
3656,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,'If this be Geoffrey?' asked; and as from far
3657,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,A doubt came floating up; but she denied
3658,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Her thought, yet blushed. O beautiful! my Star!"
3659,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Then, with the lifting of my hat, each wore"
3660,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"That look which owned to each, 'We have met before.'"
3661,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3662,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Then was the strangest bliss in life made mine;
3663,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I saw the almost worshipped--all remote;
3664,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The Star so high above that used to shine,"
3665,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Translated from the void where it did float,"
3666,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And brought into relation with the fine
3667,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Charities earth hath grown. A great joy smote
3668,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Me silent, and the child atween us tway,"
3669,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,We watched the lucent river stealing away.
3670,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3671,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"While her deep eyes down on the ripple fell,"
3672,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Quoth the small imp, '""How fast you go and go,"
3673,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"You Avon. Does it wish to stop, Estelle,"
3674,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And hear the clock, and see the orchards blow?"
3675,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,_It does not care!_ Not when the old big bell
3676,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Makes a great buzzing noise?--Who told you so?"""
3677,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And then to me, ""I like to hear it hum."
3678,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Why do you think that father could not come?"""
3679,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3680,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Estelle forgot her violin. And he,"
3681,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"O then he said: ""How careless, child, of you;"
3682,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I must send on for it. 'T would pity be
3683,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,If that were lost.
3684,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,I want to learn it too;
3685,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And when I'm nine I shall."""
3686,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Then turning, she"
3687,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Let her sweet eyes unveil them to my view;
3688,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Her stately grace outmatched my dream of old,"
3689,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,But ah! the smile dull memory had not told.
3690,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3691,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"My kinsman next, with care-worn kindly brow."
3692,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Well, father,' quoth the imp, 'we've done our part."
3693,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,We found him.'
3694,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And she, wholly girlish now,"
3695,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Laid her young hand on his with lovely art
3696,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And sweet excuses. O! I made my vow
3697,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I would all dare, such life did warm my heart;"
3698,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"We journeyed, all the air with scents of price"
3699,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Was laden, and the goal was Paradise."
3700,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3701,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"When that the Moors betook them to their sand,"
3702,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Their domination over in fair Spain,"
3703,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Each locked, men say, his door in that loved land,"
3704,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And took the key in hope to come again.
3705,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"On Moorish walls yet hung, long dust each hand,"
3706,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The keys, but not the might to use, remain;"
3707,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Is there such house in some blest land for me?
3708,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I can, I will, I do reach down the key."
3709,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3710,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"A country conquered oft, and long before,"
3711,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Of generations aye ordained to win;
3712,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"If mine the power, I will unlock the door."
3713,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Enter, O light, I bear a sunbeam in."
3714,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"What, did the crescent wane! Yet man is more,"
3715,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And love achieves because to heaven akin.
3716,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"O life! to hear again that wandering bell,"
3717,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"And hear it at thy feet, Estelle, Estelle."
3718,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3719,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Full oft I want the sacred throated bird,"
3720,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,Over our limitless waste of light which spoke
3721,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"The spirit of the call my fathers heard,"
3722,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Saying 'Let us pray,' and old world echoes woke"
3723,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Ethereal minster bells that still averr'd,"
3724,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,And with their phantom notes th' all silence broke.
3725,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'The fanes are far, but whom they shrined is near."
3726,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Thy God, the Island God, is here, is here.'"
3727,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,
3728,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To serve; to serve a thought, and serve apart"
3729,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"To meet; a few short days, a maiden won."

3734,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"'Love, it shall be done,'"

3743,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"I felt, I knew, it was my father's knell"
3744,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,That touched and could the over-sense enthrall.
3745,THE AUSTRALIAN BELL-BIRD.,"Perfect his peace, a whispering pure and deep"

4943,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But her mouth pouted as one brooding, father,"

4955,THE MAID-MARTYR.,That bristled thick with monks and hooded friars;
4956,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Moreover, women with their cheeks ablaze,"
4957,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Who swarmèd after up the narrowing street.

4964,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Though nought I longed for as for death, to know"
4965,THE MAID-MARTYR.,She did. She saw not 'neath their hoods those eyes

4981,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
4982,THE MAID-MARTYR.,My life! my love!

4986,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"As the torch touched, thick volumes of black reek"

4988,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Long films of flaxen hair floated aloft,"
4989,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Settled alow, in drifts upon the crowd."
4990,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The vile were merciful; heaped high, my dear,"
4991,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Thou didst not suffer long. O! it was soon,"
4992,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Soon over, and I knew not any more,"
4993,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Till grovelling on the ground, beating my head,"
4994,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I heard myself, and scarcely knew 't was I,"
4995,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"At Holy Church railing with fierce mad words,"
4996,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Crying and craving for a stake, for me."
4997,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"While fast the folk, as ever, such a work"
4998,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Being over, fled, and shrieked 'A heretic!"
4999,THE MAID-MARTYR.,More heretics; yon ashes smoking still.'
5000,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5001,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And up and almost over me came on
5002,THE MAID-MARTYR.,A robed--ecclesiastic--with his train
5003,THE MAID-MARTYR.,(I choose the words lest that they do some wrong)
5004,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Call him a robed ecclesiastic proud.
5005,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And I lying helpless, with my bruised face"
5006,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Beat on his garnished shoon. But he stepped back,"
5007,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Spurned me full roughly with them, called the pikes,"
5008,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Delivering orders, 'Take the bruised wretch."
5009,THE MAID-MARTYR.,He raves. Fool! thou'lt hear more of this anon.
5010,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Bestow him there.' He pointed to a door.
5011,THE MAID-MARTYR.,With that some threw a cloth upon my face
5012,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Because it bled. I knew they carried me
5013,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Within his home, and I was satisfied;"
5014,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Willing my death. Was it an abbey door?
5015,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Was 't entrance to a palace? or a house
5016,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Of priests? I say not, nor if abbot he,"
5017,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Bishop or other dignity; enough
5018,THE MAID-MARTYR.,That he so spake. 'Take in the bruised wretch.'
5019,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And I was borne far up a turret stair
5020,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Into a peakèd chamber taking form
5021,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"O' the roof, and on a pallet bed they left"
5022,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Me miserable. Yet I knew forsooth,"
5023,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Left in my pain, that evil things were said"
5024,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Of that same tower; men thence had disappeared,"
5025,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Suspect of heresy had disappeared,"
5026,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Deliver'd up, 't was whisper'd, tried and burned."
5027,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"So be it methought, I would not live, not I."
5028,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But none did question me. A beldame old,"
5029,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Kind, heedless of my sayings, tended me."
5030,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I raved at Holy Church and she was deaf,"
5031,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And at whose tower detained me, she was dumb."
5032,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"So had I food and water, rest and calm."
5033,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Then on the third day I rose up and sat
5034,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"On the side of my low bed right melancholy,"
5035,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"All that high force of passion overpast,"
5036,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I sick with dolourous thought and weak through tears
5037,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Spite of myself came to myself again
5038,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"(For I had slept), and since I could not die"
5039,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Looked through the window three parts overgrown
5040,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With leafage on the loftiest ivy ropes,"
5041,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And saw at foot o' the rise another tower
5042,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"In roof whereof a grating, dreary bare."
5043,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Lifetimes gone by, long, slow, dim, desolate,"
5044,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I knew even there had been my lost love's cell.
5045,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5046,THE MAID-MARTYR.,So musing on the man that with his foot
5047,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Spurned me, the robed ecclesiastic stern,"
5048,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"'Would he had haled me straight to prison' methought,"
5049,THE MAID-MARTYR.,'So made an end at once.'
5050,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5051,THE MAID-MARTYR.,My sufferings rose
5052,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Like billows closing over, beating down;"
5053,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Made heavier far because of a stray, strange,"
5054,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Sweet hope that mocked me at the last.
5055,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"'T was thus,"
5056,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I came from Oxford secretly, the news"
5057,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Terrible of her danger smiting me,--"
5058,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"She was so young, and ever had been bred"
5059,THE MAID-MARTYR.,With whom 't was made a peril now to name.
5060,THE MAID-MARTYR.,There had been worship in the night; some stole
5061,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To a mean chapel deep in woods, and heard"
5062,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Preaching, and prayed. She, my betrothed, was there."
5063,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Father and mother, mother and father kind,"
5064,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"So young, so innocent, had ye no ruth,"
5065,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"No fear, that ye did bring her to her doom?"
5066,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I know the chiefest Evil One himself
5067,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Sanded that floor. Their footsteps marking it
5068,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Betrayed them. How all came to pass let be.
5069,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Parted, in hiding some, other in thrall,"
5070,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Father and mother, mother and father kind,"
5071,THE MAID-MARTYR.,It may be yet ye know not this--not all.
5072,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5073,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I in the daytime lying perdue looked up
5074,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"At the castle keep impregnable,--no foot"
5075,THE MAID-MARTYR.,How rash so e'er might hope to scale it. Night
5076,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Descending, come I near, perplexedness,"
5077,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Contempt of danger, to the door o' the keep"
5078,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Drawing me. There a short stone bench I found,"
5079,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And bitterly weeping sat and leaned my head
5080,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Against the hopeless hated massiveness
5081,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Of that detested hold. A lifting moon
5082,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Had made encroachment on the dark, but deep"
5083,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Was shadow where I leaned. Within a while
5084,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I was aware, but saw no shape, of one"
5085,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Who stood beside me, a dark shadow tall."
5086,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I cared not, disavowal mattered nought"
5087,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Of grief to one so out of love with life.
5088,THE MAID-MARTYR.,But after pause I felt a hand let down
5089,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"That rested kindly, firmly, a man's hand,"
5090,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Upon my shoulder; there was cheer in it.
5091,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And presently a voice clear, whispering, low,"
5092,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With pitifulness that faltered, spoke to me."
5093,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Was I, it asked, true son of Mother Church?"
5094,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Coldly I answer'd 'Ay;' then blessed words
5095,THE MAID-MARTYR.,That danced into mine ears more excellent
5096,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Music than wedding bells had been were said,"
5097,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With certitude that I might see my maid,"
5098,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"My dear one. He would give a paper, he"
5099,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The man beside me. 'Do thy best endeavour,"
5100,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Dear youth. Thy maiden being a right sweet child
5101,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Surely will hearken to thee; an she do,"
5102,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And will recant, fair faultless heretic,"
5103,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Whose knowledge is but scant of matters high
5104,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Which hard men spake on with her, hard men forced"
5105,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"From her mouth innocent, then shall she come"
5106,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Before me; have good cheer, all may be well."
5107,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But an she will not she must burn, no power--"
5108,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Not Solomon the Great on 's ivory throne
5109,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With all his wisdom could find out a way,"
5110,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Nor I nor any to save her, she must burn."
5111,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Now hast thou till day dawn. The Mother of God
5112,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Speed thee.' A twisted scroll he gave; himself
5113,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Knocked at the door behind, and he was gone,"
5114,THE MAID-MARTYR.,A darker pillar of darkness in the dark.
5115,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Straightway one opened and I gave the scroll.
5116,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"He read, then thrust it in his lanthorn flame"
5117,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Till it was ashes; 'Follow' and no more
5118,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Whisper'd, went up the giddy spiring way,"
5119,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I after, till we reached the topmost door."
5120,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Then took a key, opened, and crying 'Delia,"
5121,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Delia my sweetheart, I am come, I am come,'"
5122,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I darted forward and he locked us in.
5123,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Two figures; one rose up and ran to me
5124,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Along the ladder of moonlight on the floor,"
5125,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Fell on my neck. Long time we kissed and wept.
5126,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5127,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But for that other, while she stood appeased"
5128,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"For cruel parting past, locked in mine arms,"
5129,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I had been glad, expecting a good end."
5130,THE MAID-MARTYR.,The cramped pale fellow prisoner; 'Courage' cried.
5131,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Then Delia lifting her fair face, the moon"
5132,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Did show me its incomparable calms.
5133,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Her effluent thought needed no word of mine,"
5134,THE MAID-MARTYR.,It whelmed my soul as in a sea of tears.
5135,THE MAID-MARTYR.,The warm enchantment leaning on my breast
5136,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Breathed as in air remote, and I was left"
5137,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To infinite detachment, even with hers"
5138,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To take cold kisses from the lips of doom,"
5139,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Look in those eyes and disinherit hope
5140,THE MAID-MARTYR.,From that high place late won.
5141,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Then murmuring low
5142,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"That other spake of Him on the cross, and soft"
5143,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"As broken-hearted mourning of the dove,"
5144,THE MAID-MARTYR.,She 'One deep calleth to another' sighed.
5145,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"'The heart of Christ mourns to my heart, ""Endure."
5146,THE MAID-MARTYR.,There was a day when to the wilderness
5147,THE MAID-MARTYR.,My great forerunner from his thrall sent forth
5148,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Sad messengers, demanding _Art thou He_?"
5149,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Think'st thou I knew no pang in that strange hour?
5150,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"How could I hold the power, and want the will"
5151,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Or want the love? That pang was his--and mine.
5152,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"He said not, Save me an thou be the Son,"
5153,THE MAID-MARTYR.,But only _Art thou He_? In my great way
5154,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"It was not writ,--legions of Angels mine,"
5155,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"There was one Angel, one ordain'd to unlock"
5156,THE MAID-MARTYR.,At my behest the doomed deadly door.
5157,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I could not tell him, tell not thee, why."" Lord,"
5158,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"We know not why, but would not have Thee grieve,"
5159,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Think not so deeply on 't; make us endure
5160,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"For thy blest sake, hearing thy sweet voice mourn"
5161,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"""I will go forth, thy desolations meet,"
5162,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And with my desolations solace them.
5163,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I will not break thy bonds but I am bound,"
5164,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With thee.""'"
5165,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5166,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I feared. That speech deep furrows cut
5167,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"In my afflicted soul. I whisper'd low,"
5168,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"'Thou wilt not heed her words, my golden girl.'"
5169,THE MAID-MARTYR.,But Delia said not ought; only her hand
5170,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Laid on my cheek and on the other leaned
5171,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Her own. O there was comfort, father,"
5172,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"In love and nearness, e'en at the crack of doom."
5173,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5174,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Then spake I, and that other said no more,"
5175,THE MAID-MARTYR.,For I appealed to God and to his Christ.
5176,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Unto the strait-barred window led my dear;
5177,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"No table, bed, nor plenishing; no place"
5178,THE MAID-MARTYR.,They had for rest: maugre two narrow chairs
5179,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"By day, by night they sat thereon upright."
5180,THE MAID-MARTYR.,One drew I to the opening; on it set
5181,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"My Delia, kneeled; upon its arm laid mine,"
5182,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And prayed to God and prayed of her.
5183,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Father,"
5184,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"If you should ask e'en now, 'And art thou glad"
5185,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Of what befell?' I could not say it, father,"
5186,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I should be glad; therefore God make me glad,"
5187,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Since we shall die to-morrow!
5188,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Think not sin,"
5189,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"O holy, harmless reverend man, to fear."
5190,THE MAID-MARTYR.,'T will be soon over. Now I know thou fear'st
5191,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Also for me, lest I be lost; but aye"
5192,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Strong comfortable hope doth wrap me round,"
5193,THE MAID-MARTYR.,A token of acceptance. I am cast
5194,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"From Holy Church, and not received of thine;"
5195,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But the great Advocate who knoweth all,"
5196,THE MAID-MARTYR.,He whispers with me.
5197,THE MAID-MARTYR.,O my Delia wept
5198,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"When I did plead; 'I have much feared to die,'"
5199,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Answering. (The moonlight on her blue-black eyes
5200,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Fell; shining tears upon their lashes hung;
5201,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Fair showed the dimple that I loved; so young,"
5202,THE MAID-MARTYR.,So very young.) 'But they did question me
5203,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Straitly, and make me many times to swear,"
5204,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To swear of all alas, that I believed."
5205,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Truly, unless my soul I would have bound"
5206,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With false oaths--difficult, innumerous, strong,"
5207,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Way was not left me to get free.
5208,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5209,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But now,'"
5210,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Said she, I am happy; I have seen the place"
5211,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Where I am going.
5212,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5213,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I will tell it you,"
5214,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Love, Hubert. Do not weep; they said to me"
5215,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"That you would come, and it would not be long."
5216,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Thus was it, being sad and full of fear,"
5217,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I was crying in the night; and prayed to God
5218,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And said, ""I have not learned high things;"" and said"
5219,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To the Saviour, ""Do not be displeased with me,"
5220,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I am not crying to get back and dwell
5221,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With my good mother and my father fond,"
5222,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Nor even with my love, Hubert--my love,"
5223,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Hubert; but I am crying because I fear
5224,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Mine answers were not rightly given--so hard
5225,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Those questions. If I did not understand,"
5226,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Wilt thou forgive me?"" And the moon went down"
5227,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"While I did pray, and looking on the floor,"
5228,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Behold a little diamond lying there,"
5229,THE MAID-MARTYR.,So small it might have dropped from out a ring.
5230,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I could but look! The diamond waxed--it grew--
5231,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"It was a diamond yet, and shot out rays,"
5232,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And in the midst of it a rose-red point;
5233,THE MAID-MARTYR.,It waxed till I might see the rose-red point
5234,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Was a little Angel 'mid those oval rays,"
5235,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With a face sweet as the first kiss, O love,"
5236,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"You gave me, and it meant that self-same thing."
5237,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5238,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Now was it tall as I, among the rays"
5239,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Standing; I touched not. Through the window drawn,"
5240,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"This barred and narrow window,--but I know"
5241,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Nothing of how, we passed, and seemed to walk"
5242,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Upon the air, till on the roof we sat."
5243,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5244,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"It spoke. The sweet mouth did not move, but all"
5245,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The Angel spoke in strange words full and old,"
5246,THE MAID-MARTYR.,It was my Angel sent to comfort me
5247,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With a message, and the message, ""I might come,"
5248,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And myself see if He forgave me."" Then"
5249,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Deliver'd he admonition, ""Afterwards"
5250,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I must return and die."" But I being dazed,"
5251,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Confused with love and joy that He so far
5252,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Did condescend, ""Ay, Eminence,"" replied,"
5253,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"""Is the way great?"" I knew not what I said."
5254,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The Angel then, ""I know not far nor near,"
5255,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But all the stars of God this side it shine."""
5256,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And I forgetful wholly for this thing
5257,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"My soul did pant in--a rapture and a pain,"
5258,THE MAID-MARTYR.,So great as they would melt it quite away
5259,THE MAID-MARTYR.,To a vanishing like mist when sultry rays
5260,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Shot from the daystar reckon with it--I
5261,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Said in my simpleness, ""But is there time?"
5262,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"For in three days I am to burn, and O"
5263,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I would fain see that he forgiveth first.
5264,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Pray you make haste."" ""I know not haste,"" he said;"
5265,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"""I was not fashioned to be thrall of time."
5266,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"What is it?"" And I marvelled, saw outlying,"
5267,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Shaped like a shield and of dimensions like
5268,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"An oval in the sky beyond all stars,"
5269,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And trembled with foreknowledge. We were bound
5270,THE MAID-MARTYR.,To that same golden holy hollow. I
5271,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Misdoubted how to go, but we were gone."
5272,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I set off wingless, walking empty air"
5273,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Beside him. In a moment we were caught
5274,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Among thick swarms of lost ones, evil, fell"
5275,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Of might, only a little less than gods,"
5276,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And strong enough to tear the earth to shreds,"
5277,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Set shoulders to the sun and rend it out
5278,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"O' its place. Their wings did brush across my face,"
5279,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Yet felt I nought; the place was vaster far
5280,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Than all this wholesome pastoral windy world.
5281,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Through it we spinning, pierced to its far brink,"
5282,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Saw menacing frowns and we were forth again.
5283,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Time has no instant for the reckoning ought
5284,THE MAID-MARTYR.,So sudden; 't was as if a lightning flash
5285,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Threw us within it, and a swifter flash,"
5286,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"We riding harmless down its swordlike edge,"
5287,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Shot us fast forth to empty nothingness.
5288,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5289,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"All my soul trembled, and my body it seemed"
5290,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Pleaded than such a sight rather to faint
5291,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To the last silence, and the eery grave"
5292,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Inhabit, and the slow solemnities"
5293,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Of dying faced, content me with my shroud."
5294,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5295,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And yet was lying athwart the morning star
5296,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"That shone in front, that holy hollow; yet"
5297,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"It loomed, as hung atilt towards the world,"
5298,THE MAID-MARTYR.,That in her time of sleep appeared to look
5299,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Up to it, into it."
5300,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"We, though I wept,"
5301,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Fearing and longing, knowing not how to go,"
5302,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"My heart gone first, both mine eyes dedicate"
5303,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To its all-hallowed sweet desirèd gold,"
5304,THE MAID-MARTYR.,We on the empty limitless abyss
5305,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Walked slowly. It was far;
5306,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And I feared much,"
5307,THE MAID-MARTYR.,For lo! when I looked down deep under me
5308,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The little earth was such a little thing,"
5309,THE MAID-MARTYR.,How in the vasty dark find her again?
5310,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The crescent moon a moorèd boat hard by,"
5311,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Did wait on her and touch her ragged rims
5312,THE MAID-MARTYR.,With a small gift of silver.
5313,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Love! my life!
5314,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Hubert, while I yet wept, O we were there."
5315,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"A menai of Angels first, a swarm of stars"
5316,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Took us among them (all alive with stars
5317,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Shining and shouting each to each that place),"
5318,THE MAID-MARTYR.,The feathered multitude did lie so thick
5319,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"We walked upon them, walked on outspread wings,"
5320,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And the great gates were standing open.
5321,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Love!
5322,THE MAID-MARTYR.,The country is not what you think; but oh!
5323,THE MAID-MARTYR.,When you have seen it nothing else contents.
5324,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The voice, the vision was not what you think--"
5325,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But oh! it was all. It was the meaning of life,"
5326,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Excellent consummation of desires
5327,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"For ever, let into the heart with pain"
5328,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Most sweet. That smile did take the feeding soul
5329,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Deeper and deeper into heaven. The sward
5330,THE MAID-MARTYR.,(For I had bowed my face on it) I found
5331,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Grew in my spirit's longed for native land--
5332,THE MAID-MARTYR.,At last I was at home.'
5333,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And here she paused:
5334,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I must needs weep. I have not been in heaven,"
5335,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Therefore she could not tell me what she heard,"
5336,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Therefore she might not tell me what she saw,"
5337,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Only I understood that One drew near
5338,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Who said to her she should e'en come, 'Because,'"
5339,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Said He, 'My Father loves Me. I will ask"
5340,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"He send, a guiding Angel for My sake,"
5341,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Since the dark way is long, and rough, and hard,"
5342,THE MAID-MARTYR.,So that I shall not lose whom I love--thee.'
5343,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5344,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Other words wonderful of things not known,"
5345,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"When she had uttered, I gave hope away,"
5346,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Cried out, and took her in despairing arms,"
5347,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Asking no more. Then while the comfortless
5348,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Dawn till night fainted grew, alas! a key"
5349,THE MAID-MARTYR.,That with abhorrèd jarring probed the door.
5350,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"We kissed, we looked, unlocked our arms. She sighed"
5351,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"'Remember,' 'Ay, I will remember. What?'"
5352,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"'To come to me.' Then I, thrust roughly forth--"
5353,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I, bereft, dumb, forlorn, unremedied"
5354,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"My hurt for ever, stumbled blindly down,"
5355,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And the great door was shut behind and chained.
5356,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5357,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The weird pathetic scarlet of day dawning,"
5358,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"More kin to death of night than birth of morn,"
5359,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Peered o'er yon hill bristling with spires of pine.
5360,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I heard the crying of the men condemned,"
5361,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Men racked, that should be martyr'd presently,"
5362,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And my great grief met theirs with might; I held
5363,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"All our poor earth's despairs in my poor breast,"
5364,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The choking reek, the faggots were all mine."
5365,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Ay, and the partings they were all mine--mine."
5366,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Father, it will be very good methinks"
5367,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To die so, to die soon. It doth appease"
5368,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The soul in misery for its fellows, when"
5369,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"There is no help, to suffer even as they."
5370,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5371,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Father, when I had lost her, when I sat"
5372,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"After my sickness on the pallet bed,"
5373,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"My forehead dropp'd into my hand, behold"
5374,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Some one beside me. A man's hand let down
5375,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"With that same action kind, compassionate,"
5376,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Upon my shoulder. And I took the hand
5377,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Between mine own, laying my face thereon."
5378,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I knew this man for him who spoke with me,"
5379,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Letting me see my Delia. I looked up.
5380,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Lo! lo! the robed ecclesiastic proud,"
5381,THE MAID-MARTYR.,He and this other one. Tell you his name?
5382,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Am I a fiend? No, he was good to me,"
5383,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Almost he placed his life in my hand.
5384,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Father,"
5385,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"He with good pitying words long talked to me,"
5386,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"'Did I not strive to save her?' 'Ay,' quoth I."
5387,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"'But sith it would not be, I also claim"
5388,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Death, burning; let me therefore die--let me."
5389,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I am wicked, would be heretic, but, faith,"
5390,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I know not how, and Holy Church I hate."
5391,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"She is no mother of mine, she slew my love.'"
5392,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"What answer? 'Peace, peace, thou art hard on me."
5393,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Favour I forfeit with the Mother of God,"
5394,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Lose rank among the saints, foresee my soul"
5395,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Drenched in the unmitigated flame, and take"
5396,THE MAID-MARTYR.,My payment in the lives snatched at all risk
5397,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"From battling in it here. O, an thou turn"
5398,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And tear from me, lost to that other world"
5399,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"My heart's reward in this, I am twice lost;"

5401,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Father, I know"
5402,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The Church would rail, hound forth, disgrace, try, burn,"
5403,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Make his proud name, discover'd, infamy,"
5404,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Tread underfoot his ashes, curse his soul."
5405,THE MAID-MARTYR.,But God is greater than the Church. I hope
5406,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"He shall not, for that he loved men, lose God."
5407,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I hope to hear it said 'Thy sins are all
5408,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Forgiven; come in, thou hast done well.'"
5409,THE MAID-MARTYR.,For me
5410,THE MAID-MARTYR.,My chronicle comes down to its last page.
5411,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"'Is not life sweet?' quoth he, and comforted"
5412,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"My sick heart with good words, 'duty' and 'home.'"
5413,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Then took me at moonsetting down the stair
5414,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To the dark deserted midway of the street,"
5415,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Gave me a purse of money, and his hand"
5416,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Laid on my shoulder, holding me with words"
5417,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"A father might have said, bad me God speed,"
5418,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"So pushed me from him, turned, and he was gone."
5419,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5420,THE MAID-MARTYR.,There was a Pleiad lost; where is she now?
5421,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"None knoweth,--O she reigns, it is my creed,"
5422,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Otherwhere dedicate to making day.
5423,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The God of Gods, He doubtless looked to that"
5424,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Who wasteth never ought He fashionèd.
5425,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I have no vision, but where vision fails"
5426,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Faith cheers, and truly, truly there is need,"
5427,THE MAID-MARTYR.,The god of this world being so unkind.
5428,THE MAID-MARTYR.,O love! My girl for ever to the world
5429,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Wanting. Lost, not that any one should find,"
5430,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But wasted for the sake of waste, and lost"
5431,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"For love of man's undoing, of man's tears,"
5432,THE MAID-MARTYR.,By envy of the evil one; I mourn
5433,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"For thee, my golden girl, I mourn, I mourn."
5434,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5435,THE MAID-MARTYR.,He set me free. And it befell anon
5436,THE MAID-MARTYR.,That I must imitate him. Then 't befell
5437,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"That on the holy Book I read, and all,"
5438,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"The mediating Mother and her Babe,"
5439,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"God and the Church, and man and life and death,"
5440,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And the dark gulfs of bitter purging flame,"
5441,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Did take on alteration. Like a ship
5442,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Cast from her moorings, drifting from her port,"
5443,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Not bound to any land, not sure of land,"
5444,THE MAID-MARTYR.,My dull'd soul lost her reckoning on that sea
5445,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"She sailed, and yet the voyage was nigh done."
5446,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5447,THE MAID-MARTYR.,This God was not the God I had known; this Christ
5448,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Was other. O, a gentler God, a Christ--"
5449,THE MAID-MARTYR.,By a mother and a Father infinite--
5450,THE MAID-MARTYR.,In distance each from each made kin to me.
5451,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Blest Sufferer on the rood; but yet, I say"
5452,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Other. Far gentler, and I cannot tell,"
5453,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Father, if you, or she, my golden girl,"
5454,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Or I, or any aright those mysteries read."
5455,THE MAID-MARTYR.,
5456,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I cannot fathom them. There is not time,"
5457,THE MAID-MARTYR.,So quickly men condemned me to this cell.
5458,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I quarrell'd not so much with Holy Church
5459,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"For that she taught, as that my love she burned."
5460,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I die because I hid her enemies,"
5461,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And read the Book.
5462,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"But O, forgiving God,"
5463,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"I do elect to trust thee. I have thought,"
5464,THE MAID-MARTYR.,What! are there set between us and the sun
5465,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Millions of miles, and did He like a tent"
5466,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Rear up yon vasty sky? Is heaven less wide?
5467,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And dwells He there, but for His wingèd host,"
5468,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Almost alone? Truly I think not so;
5469,THE MAID-MARTYR.,He has had trouble enough with this poor world
5470,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To make Him as an earthly father would,"
5471,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Love it and value it more.
5472,THE MAID-MARTYR.,He did not give
5473,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"So much to have us with Him, and yet fail."
5474,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And now He knows I would believe e'en so
5475,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"As pleaseth Him, an there was time to learn"
5476,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Or certitude of heart; but time fails, time."
5477,THE MAID-MARTYR.,He knoweth also 't were a piteous thing
5478,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Not to be sure of my love's welfare--not
5479,THE MAID-MARTYR.,To see her happy and good in that new home.
5480,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Most piteous. I could all forego but this.
5481,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"O let me see her, Lord."
5482,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"What, also I!"
5483,THE MAID-MARTYR.,White ashes and a waft of vapour--I
5484,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"To flutter on before the winds. No, no."
5485,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And yet for ever ay--my flesh shall hiss
5486,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And I shall hear 't. Dreadful, unbearable!"
5487,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Is it to-morrow?
5488,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Ay, indeed, indeed,"
5489,THE MAID-MARTYR.,To-morrow. But my moods are as great waves
5490,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"That rise and break and thunder down on me,"
5491,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And then fall'n back sink low.
5492,THE MAID-MARTYR.,I have waked long
5493,THE MAID-MARTYR.,And cannot hold my thoughts upon th' event;
5494,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"They slip, they wander forth."
5495,THE MAID-MARTYR.,How the dusk grows.
5496,THE MAID-MARTYR.,This is the last moonrising we shall see.
5497,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Methought till morn to pray, and cannot pray."
5498,THE MAID-MARTYR.,Where is mine Advocate? let Him say all
5499,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"And more was in my mind to say this night,"
5500,THE MAID-MARTYR.,"Because to-morrow--Ah! no more of that,"

6470,PERDITA.,And to lower your passion I speak--that other it was I meant.
6471,PERDITA.,
6472,PERDITA.,"That other I meant (but I know not how) to speak of, nor April days,"
6473,PERDITA.,Nor a man's sweet voice that pleaded--O (but I promised this)--
6474,PERDITA.,"He never talked of marriage, never; I grant him that praise;"
6475,PERDITA.,"And he bent his stately head, and I lost, and he won with a kiss."
6476,PERDITA.,
6477,PERDITA.,"He led me away--O, how poignant sweet the nightingale's note that noon--"
6478,PERDITA.,"I beheld, and each crisped spire of grass to him for my sake was fair,"
6479,PERDITA.,"And warm winds flattered my soul blowing straight from the soul of June,"
6480,PERDITA.,"And a lovely lie was spread on the fields, but the blue was bare."
6481,PERDITA.,
6482,PERDITA.,"When I looked up, he said: 'Love, fair love! O rather look in these eyes"
6483,PERDITA.,With thine far sweeter than eyes of Eve when she stepped the valley
6484,PERDITA.,unshod'--
6485,PERDITA.,"For ONE might be looking through it, he thought, and he would not in any"
6486,PERDITA.,wise
6487,PERDITA.,"I should mark it open, limitless, empty, bare 'neath the gaze of God."
6488,PERDITA.,
6489,PERDITA.,"Ah me! I was happy--yes, I was; 't is fit you should know it all,"
6490,PERDITA.,"While love was warm and tender and yearning, the rough winds troubled"
6491,PERDITA.,me not;
6492,PERDITA.,I heard them moan without in the forest; heard the chill rains fall--
6493,PERDITA.,"But I thought my place was sheltered with him--I forgot, I forgot."
6494,PERDITA.,
6495,PERDITA.,After came news of a wife; I think he was glad I should know.
6496,PERDITA.,"To stay my pleading, 'take me to church and give me my ring';"
6497,PERDITA.,"'You should have spoken before,' he had sighed, when I prayed him so,"
6498,PERDITA.,"For his heart was sick for himself and me, and this bitter thing."
6499,PERDITA.,
6500,PERDITA.,"But my dream was over me still,--I was half beguiled,"
6501,PERDITA.,"And he in his kindness left me seldom, O seldom, alone,"
6502,PERDITA.,"And yet love waxed cold, and I saw the face of my little child,"
6503,PERDITA.,"And then at the last I knew what I was, and what I had done."
6504,PERDITA.,
6505,PERDITA.,'YOU _will give me the name of wife_. YOU _will give me a ring_.'--O
6506,PERDITA.,peace!
6507,PERDITA.,You are not let to ruin your life because I ruined mine;
6508,PERDITA.,You will go to your people at home. There will be rest and release;
6509,PERDITA.,"The bitter now will be sweet full soon--ay, and denial divine."
6510,PERDITA.,
6511,PERDITA.,But spare me the ending. I did not wait to be quite cast away;
6512,PERDITA.,"I left him asleep, and the bare sun rising shone red on my gown."
6513,PERDITA.,"There was dust in the lane, I remember; prints of feet in it lay,"
6514,PERDITA.,And honeysuckle trailed in the path that led on to the down.
6515,PERDITA.,
6516,PERDITA.,"I was going nowhere--I wandered up, then turned and dared to look back,"
6517,PERDITA.,Where low in the valley he careless and quiet--quiet and careless slept.
6518,PERDITA.,"'_Did I love him yet?_' I loved him. Ay, my heart on the upland track"
6519,PERDITA.,"Cried to him, sighed to him out by the wheat, as I walked, and I wept."
6520,PERDITA.,
6521,PERDITA.,"I knew of another alas, one that had been in my place,"
6522,PERDITA.,"Her little ones, she forsaken, were almost in need;"
6523,PERDITA.,"I went to her, and carried my babe, then all in my satins and lace"
6524,PERDITA.,"I sank at the step of her desolate door, a mourner indeed."
6525,PERDITA.,
6526,PERDITA.,"I cried, ''T is the way of the world, would I had never been born!'"
6527,PERDITA.,"'Ay, 't is the way of the world, but have you no sense to see"
6528,PERDITA.,"For all the way of the world,' she answers and laughs me to scorn,"
6529,PERDITA.,"'The world is made the world that it is by fools like you, like me.'"
6530,PERDITA.,
6531,PERDITA.,"Right hard upon me, hard on herself, and cold as the cold stone,"
6532,PERDITA.,"But she took me in; and while I lay sick I knew I was lost,"
6533,PERDITA.,"Lost with the man I loved, or lost without him, making my moan"
6534,PERDITA.,"Blighted and rent of the bitter frost, wrecked, tempest tossed, lost,"
6535,PERDITA.,lost!
6536,PERDITA.,
6537,PERDITA.,"How am I fallen:--we that might make of the world what we would,"
6538,PERDITA.,Some of us sink in deep waters. Ah! '_you would raise me again?'_
6539,PERDITA.,"No true heart,--you cannot, you cannot, and all in my soul that is good"
6540,PERDITA.,"Cries out against such a wrong. Let be, your quest is for ever in vain."
6541,PERDITA.,
6542,PERDITA.,"For I feel with another heart, I think with another mind,"
6543,PERDITA.,"I have worsened life, I have wronged the world, I have lowered the light;"
6544,PERDITA.,"But as for him, his words and his ways were after his kind,"
6545,PERDITA.,"He did but spoil where he could, and waste where he might."
6546,PERDITA.,
6547,PERDITA.,For he was let to do it; I let him and left his soul
6548,PERDITA.,"To walk mid the ruins he made of home in remembrance of love's despairs,"
6549,PERDITA.,"Despairs that harden the hearts of men and shadow their heads with dole,"
6550,PERDITA.,"And woman's fault, though never on earth, may be healed,--but what of"
6551,PERDITA.,theirs.
6552,PERDITA.,
6553,PERDITA.,"'T was fit you should hear it all--What, tears? they comfort me; now you"
6554,PERDITA.,"will go,"
6555,PERDITA.,"Nor wrong your life for the nought you call 'a pair of beautiful eyes,'"
6556,PERDITA.,"_'I will not say I love you.'_ Truly I will not, no."
6557,PERDITA.,"_'Will, I pity you?'_ Ay, but the pang will be short, you shall wake and be"
6558,PERDITA.,wise.
6559,PERDITA.,
6560,PERDITA.,"_'Shall we meet?_ We shall meet on the other side, but not before."
6561,PERDITA.,"I shall be pure and fair, I shall hear the sound of THE NAME,"
6562,PERDITA.,"And see the form of His face. You too will walk on that shore,"
6563,PERDITA.,"In the garden of the Lord God, where neither is sorrow nor shame."
6564,PERDITA.,
6565,PERDITA.,"Farewell, I shall bide alone, for God took my one white lamb,"
6566,PERDITA.,"I work for such as she was, and I will the while I last,"

7230,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"More near, and kneeled beside the small frail thing,"

7272,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And, when the verger gave, he moved with him"

7284,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And carven cheeks of dimpled cherubim,"
7285,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And dropped upon the curate as he passed,"

7351,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Like a little wayside grass. Castaway shells,"
7352,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Lifted and tossed aside by a plunging wave,"
7353,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Have no more force against it than have I
7354,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Against the sweeping, weltering wave of life,"
7355,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That, lifting and dislodging me, drives on,"
7356,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And notes not mine endeavor."""
7357,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7358,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Afterward,"
7359,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"He added more words like to these; to wit,"
7360,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,That it was hard to see the world so sad:
7361,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,He would that it were happier. It was hard
7362,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,To see the blameless overborne; and hard
7363,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"To know that God, who loves the world, should yet"
7364,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Let it lie down in sorrow, when a smile"
7365,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"From him would make it laugh and sing,--a word"
7366,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"From him transform it to a heaven. He said,"
7367,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Moreover, ""When will this be done? My life"
7368,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Hath not yet reached the noon, and I am tired;"
7369,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And oh! it may be that, uncomforted"
7370,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,By foolish hope of doing good and vain
7371,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Conceit of being useful, I may live,"
7372,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,And it may be my duty to go on
7373,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Working for years and years, for years and years."""
7374,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7375,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"But, while the words were uttered, in his heart"
7376,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,There dawned a vague alarm. He was aware
7377,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That somewhat touched him, and he lifted up"
7378,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"His face. ""I am alone,"" the curate said,--"
7379,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""I think I am alone. What is it, then?"
7380,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,I am ashamed! My raiment is not clean.
7381,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"My lips,--I am afraid they are not clean."
7382,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"My heart is darkened and unclean. Ah me,"
7383,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"To be a man, and yet to tremble so!"
7384,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Strange, strange!"""
7385,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,And there was sitting at his feet--
7386,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,He could not see it plainly--at his feet
7387,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"A very little child. And, while the blood"
7388,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Drave to his heart, he set his eye on it,"
7389,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Gazing, and, lo! the loveliness from heaven"
7390,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Took clearer form and color. He beheld
7391,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The strange, wise sweetness of a dimpled mouth,--"
7392,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The deep serene of eyes at home with bliss,"
7393,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And perfect in possession. So it spoke,"
7394,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""My master!"" but he answered not a word;"
7395,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And it went on: ""I had a name, a name."
7396,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"He knew my name; but here they can forget."""
7397,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The curate answered: ""Nay, I know thee well."
7398,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"I love thee. Wherefore art thou come?"" It said,"
7399,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""They sent me;"" and he faltered, ""Fold thy hand,"
7400,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,O most dear little one! for on it gleams
7401,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,A gem that is so bright I cannot look
7402,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Thereon."" It said, ""When I did leave this world,"
7403,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,That was a tear. But that was long ago;
7404,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"For I have lived among the happy folk,"
7405,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"You wot of, ages, ages."" Then said he,"
7406,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""Do they forget us, while beneath the palms"
7407,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"They take their infinite leisure?"" And, with eyes"
7408,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That seemed to muse upon him, looking up"
7409,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"In peace the little child made answer, ""Nay;"""
7410,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And murmured, in the language that he loved,"
7411,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""How is it that his hair is not yet white;"
7412,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,For I and all the others have been long
7413,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Waiting for him to come."""
7414,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""And was it long?"""
7415,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The curate answered, pondering. ""Time being done,"
7416,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Shall life indeed expand, and give the sense,"
7417,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"In our to-come, of infinite extension?"""
7418,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Then said the child, ""In heaven we children talk"
7419,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Of the great matters, and our lips are wise;"
7420,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,But here I can but talk with thee in words
7421,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That here I knew."" And therewithal, arisen,"
7422,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"It said, ""I pray you take me in your arms."""
7423,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Then, being afraid but willing, so he did;"
7424,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And partly drew about the radiant child,"
7425,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"For better covering its dread purity,"
7426,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,The foldings of his gown. And he beheld
7427,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Its beauty, and the tremulous woven light"
7428,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That hung upon its hair; withal, the robe,"
7429,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""Whiter than fuller of this world can white,"""
7430,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,That clothed its immortality. And so
7431,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The trembling came again, and he was dumb,"
7432,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Repenting his uncleanness: and he lift
7433,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"His eyes, and all the holy place was full"
7434,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Of living things; and some were faint and dim,"
7435,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"As if they bore an intermittent life,"
7436,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Waxing and waning; and they had no form,"
7437,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"But drifted on like slowly trailèd clouds,"
7438,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Or moving spots of darkness, with an eye"
7439,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Apiece. And some, in guise of evil birds,"
7440,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Came by in troops, and stretched their naked necks,"
7441,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And some were men-like, but their heads hung down;"
7442,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And he said, ""O my God! let me find grace"
7443,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Not to behold their faces, for I know"
7444,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"They must be wicked and right terrible."""
7445,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"But while he prayed, lo! whispers; and there moved"
7446,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Two shadows on the wall. He could not see
7447,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,The forms of them that cast them: he could see
7448,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Only the shadows as of two that sat
7449,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Upon the floor, where, clad in women's weeds,"
7450,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,They lisped together. And he shuddered much:
7451,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"There was a rustling near him, and he feared"
7452,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Lest they should touch him, and he feel their touch."
7453,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7454,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""It is not great,"" quoth one, ""the work achieved."
7455,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"We do, and we delight to do, our best:"
7456,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"But that is little; for, my dear,"" quoth she,"
7457,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""This tower and town have been infested long"
7458,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"With angels.""--""Ay,"" the other made reply,"
7459,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""I had a little evil-one, of late,"
7460,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,That I picked up as it was crawling out
7461,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"O' the pit, and took and cherished in my breast."
7462,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"It would divine for me, and oft would moan,"
7463,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"'Pray thee, no churches,' and it spake of this."
7464,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"But I was harried once,--thou know'st by whom,--"
7465,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And fled in here; and, when he followed me,"
7466,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"I crouching by this pillar, he let down"
7467,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"His hand,--being all too proud to send his eyes"
7468,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"In its wake,--and, plucking forth my tender imp,"
7469,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Flung it behind him. It went yelping forth;
7470,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And, as for me, I never saw it more."
7471,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Much is against us,--very much: the times"
7472,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Are hard."" She paused: her fellow took the word,"
7473,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Plaining on such as preach and them that plead.
7474,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""Even such as haunt the yawning mouths of hell,"""
7475,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Quoth she, ""and pluck them back that run thereto."""
7476,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Then, like a sudden blow, there fell on him"
7477,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The utterance of his name. ""There is no soul"
7478,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That I loathe more, and oftener curse. Woe's me,"
7479,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That cursing should be vain! Ay, he will go"
7480,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Gather the sucking children, that are yet"
7481,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Too young for us, and watch and shelter them."
7482,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Till the strong Angels--pitiless and stern,"
7483,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"But to them loving ever--sweep them in,"
7484,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"By armsful, to the unapproachable fold."
7485,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7486,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""We strew his path with gold: it will not lie."
7487,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"'Deal softly with him,' was the master's word."
7488,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,We brought him all delights: his angel came
7489,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,And stood between them and his eyes. They spend
7490,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Much pains upon him,--keep him poor and low"
7491,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,And unbeloved; and thus he gives his mind
7492,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"To fill the fateful, the impregnable"
7493,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Child-fold, and sow on earth the seed of stars."
7494,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7495,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""Oh! hard is serving against love,--the love"
7496,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Of the Unspeakable; for if we soil
7497,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,The souls He openeth out a washing-place;
7498,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And if we grudge, and snatch away the bread,"
7499,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Then will He save by poverty, and gain"
7500,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,By early giving up of blameless life;
7501,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And if we shed out gold, He even will save"
7502,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"In spite of gold,--of twice-refinèd gold."""
7503,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7504,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,With that the curate set his daunted eyes
7505,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,To look upon the shadows of the fiends.
7506,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,He was made sure they could not see the child
7507,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,That nestled in his arms; he also knew
7508,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,They were unconscious that his mortal ears
7509,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Had new intelligence, which gave their speech"
7510,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Possible entrance through his garb of clay.
7511,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7512,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"He was afraid, yet awful gladness reached"
7513,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,His soul: the testimony of the lost
7514,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Upbraided him; but while he trembled yet,"
7515,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,The heavenly child had lifted up its head
7516,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And left his arms, and on the marble floor"
7517,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Stood beckoning.
7518,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7519,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And, its touch withdrawn, the place"
7520,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Was silent, empty; all that swarming tribe"
7521,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Of evil ones concealed behind the veil,"
7522,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And shut into their separate world, were closed"
7523,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"From his observance. He arose, and paced"
7524,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"After the little child,--as half in fear"
7525,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That it would leave him,--till they reached a door;"
7526,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And then said he,--but much distraught he spoke,"
7527,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Laying his hand across the lock,--""This door"
7528,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Shuts in the stairs whereby men mount the tower.
7529,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Wouldst thou go up, and so withdraw to heaven?"""
7530,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"It answered, ""I will mount them."" Then said he,"
7531,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""And I will follow.""--""So thou shalt do well,"""
7532,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The radiant thing replied, and it went up,"
7533,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And he, amazed, went after; for the stairs,"
7534,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Otherwhile dark, were lightened by the rays"
7535,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Shed out of raiment woven in high heaven,"
7536,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,And hair whereon had smiled the light of God.
7537,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7538,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"With that, they, pacing on, came out at last"
7539,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Into a dim, weird place,--a chamber formed"
7540,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Betwixt the roofs: for you shall know that all
7541,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The vaulting of the nave, fretted and fine,"
7542,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Was covered with the dust of ages, laid"
7543,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Thick with those chips of stone which they had left
7544,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Who wrought it; but a high-pitched roof was reared
7545,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Above it, and the western gable pierced"
7546,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,With three long narrow lights. Great tie-beams loomed
7547,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Across, and many daws frequented there,"
7548,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,The starling and the sparrow littered it
7549,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"With straw, and peeped from many a shady nook;"
7550,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And there was lifting up of wings, and there"
7551,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Was hasty exit when the curate came.
7552,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,But sitting on a beam and moving not
7553,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"For him, he saw two fair gray turtle-doves"
7554,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Bowing their heads, and cooing; and the child"
7555,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Put forth a hand to touch his own, but straight"
7556,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"He, startled, drew it back, because, forsooth,"
7557,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"A stirring fancy smote him, and he thought"
7558,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That language trembled on their innocent tongues,"
7559,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,And floated forth in speech that man could hear.
7560,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Then said the child, ""Yet touch, my master dear."""
7561,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And he let down his hand, and touched again;"
7562,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And so it was. ""But if they had their way,"""
7563,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"One turtle cooed, ""how should this world go on?"""
7564,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7565,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Then he looked well upon them, as he stood"
7566,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Upright before them. They were feathered doves,"
7567,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,And sitting close together; and their eyes
7568,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Were rounded with the rim that marks their kind.
7569,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Their tender crimson feet did pat the beam,--"
7570,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,No phantoms they; and soon the fellow-dove
7571,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Made answer, ""Nay they count themselves so wise,"
7572,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,There is no task they shall be set to do
7573,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,But they will ask God why. What mean they so?
7574,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The glory is not in the task, but in"
7575,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The doing it for Him. What should he think,"
7576,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Brother, this man that must, forsooth, be set"
7577,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Such noble work, and suffered to behold"
7578,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Its fruit, if he knew more of us and ours?"""
7579,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"With that the other leaned, as if attent:"
7580,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""I am not perfect, brother, in his thought."""
7581,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The mystic bird replied. ""Brother, he saith,"
7582,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,'But it is nought: the work is overhard.'
7583,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Whose fault is that? God sets not overwork.
7584,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"He saith the world is sorrowful, and he"
7585,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Is therefore sorrowful. He cannot set
7586,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The crooked straight;--but who demands of him,"
7587,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"O brother, that he should? What! thinks he, then,"
7588,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"His work is God's advantage, and his will"
7589,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,More bent to aid the world than its dread Lord's?
7590,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Nay, yet there live amongst us legions fair,"
7591,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Millions on millions, who could do right well"
7592,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"What he must fail in; and 'twas whispered me,"
7593,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That chiefly for himself the task is given,--"
7594,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"His little daily task."" With that he paused."
7595,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7596,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Then said the other, preening its fair wing,"
7597,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""Men have discovered all God's islands now,"
7598,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And given them names; whereof they are as proud,"
7599,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And deem themselves as great, as if their hands"
7600,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Had made them. Strange is man, and strange his pride."
7601,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Now, as for us, it matters not to learn"
7602,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,What and from whence we be: How should we tell?
7603,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Our world is undiscovered in these skies,"
7604,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Our names not whispered. Yet, for us and ours,"
7605,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"What joy it is,--permission to come down,"
7606,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Not souls, as he, to the bosom of their God,"
7607,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"To guide, but to their goal the winged fowls,"
7608,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,His lovely lower-fashioned lives to help
7609,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"To take their forms by legions, fly, and draw"
7610,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"With us the sweet, obedient, flocking things"
7611,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That ever hear our message reverently,"
7612,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And follow us far. How should they know their way,"
7613,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Forsooth, alone? Men say they fly alone;"
7614,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Yet some have set on record, and averred,"
7615,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"That they, among the flocks, had duly marked"
7616,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"A leader."""
7617,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,Then his fellow made reply:
7618,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""They might divine the Maker's heart. Come forth,"
7619,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Fair dove, to find the flocks, and guide their wings,"
7620,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"For Him that loveth them."""
7621,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"With that, the child"
7622,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Withdrew his hand, and all their speech was done."
7623,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"He moved toward them, but they fluttered forth"
7624,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,And fled into the sunshine.
7625,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""I would fain,"""
7626,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Said he, ""have heard some more. And wilt thou go?"""
7627,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"He added to the child, for this had turned."
7628,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""Ay,"" quoth he, gently, ""to the beggar's place;"
7629,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"For I would see the beggar in the porch."""
7630,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,
7631,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"So they went down together to the door,"
7632,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Which, when the curate opened, lo! without"
7633,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,The beggar sat; and he saluted him:
7634,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""Good morrow, master."" ""Wherefore art thou here?"""
7635,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The curate asked: ""it is not service time,"
7636,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And none will enter now to give thee alms."""
7637,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"Then said the beggar, ""I have hope at heart"

7639,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"""Art thou so sick that thou dost think to die?"""
7640,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The curate said. With that the beggar laughed,"
7641,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And under his dim eyelids gathered tears,"
7642,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,And he was all a-tremble with a strange
7643,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And moving exaltation. ""Ay,"" quoth he,"
7644,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"And set his face toward high heaven: ""I think"
7645,THE MONITIONS OF THE UNSEEN.,"The blessing that I wait on must be near."""

9663,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Where on the narrow ledges, sharp and rude,"
9664,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Preening their wings the blue rock-pigeons cooed.
9665,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,

9690,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Answered, ""I cannot, for the long waves flow"

9702,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Till hunger reached him; then he made a fire,"
9703,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"A driftwood fire, and wandered listlessly"
9704,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And gathered many eggs at his desire,"
9705,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And dressed them for his meal, and then he lay"
9706,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And slept, and woke upon the second day."
9707,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9708,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Whenas he said, ""The cave shall be my home;"
9709,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"None will molest me, for the brown cliffs rise"
9710,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Like castles of defence behind,--the foam"
9711,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Of the remorseless sea beneath me lies;
9712,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,'Tis easy from the cliff my food to win--
9713,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,The nations of the rock-dove breed therein.
9714,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9715,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""For fuel, at the ebb yon fair expanse"
9716,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Is strewed with driftwood by the breaking wave,"
9717,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And in the sea is fish for sustenance.
9718,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"I will build up the entrance of the cave,"
9719,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And leave therein a window and a door,"
9720,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And here will dwell and leave it nevermore."""
9721,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9722,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Then even so he did: and when his task,"
9723,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Many long days being over, was complete,"
9724,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"When he had eaten, as he sat to bask"
9725,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"In the red firelight glowing at his feet,"
9726,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"He was right glad of shelter, and he said,"
9727,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""Now for my comrades am I comforted."""
9728,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9729,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Then did the voice awake and speak again;
9730,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"It murmured, ""Man, look up!"" But he replied,"
9731,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""I cannot. O, mine eyes, mine eyes are fain"
9732,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Down on the red wood-ashes to abide
9733,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Because they warm me."" Then the voice was still,"
9734,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And left the lonely mariner to his will.
9735,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9736,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And soon it came to pass that he got gain.
9737,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"He had great flocks of pigeons which he fed,"
9738,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And drew great store of fish from out the main,"
9739,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And down from eiderducks; and then he said,"
9740,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""It is not good that I should lead my life"
9741,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"In silence, I will take to me a wife."""
9742,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9743,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"He took a wife, and brought her home to him;"
9744,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And he was good to her and cherished her
9745,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,So that she loved him; then when light waxed dim
9746,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Gloom came no more; and she would minister
9747,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"To all his wants; while he, being well content,"
9748,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Counted her company right excellent.

9751,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"She leaned to watch him while he put to sea,"
9752,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"This happy wife, down-gazing at the shore,"
9753,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Said sweetly, ""It is better now with me"
9754,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Than it was lately when I used to spin
9755,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"In my old father's house beside the lin."""
9756,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9757,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And then the soft voice of the cave awoke--
9758,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,The soft voice which had haunted it erewhile--
9759,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And gently to the wife it also spoke,"
9760,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""Woman, look up!"" But she, with tender guile,"
9761,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Gave it denial, answering, ""Nay, not so,"
9762,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,For all that I should look on lieth below.
9763,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9764,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""The great sky overhead is not so good"
9765,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"For my two eyes as yonder stainless sea,"
9766,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The source and yielder of our livelihood,"
9767,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Where rocks his little boat that loveth me."""
9768,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"This when the wife had said she moved away,"
9769,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And looked no higher than the wave all day.
9770,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9771,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Now when the year ran out a child she bore,"
9772,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And there was such rejoicing in the cave
9773,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,As surely never had there been before
9774,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Since God first made it. Then full, sweet, and grave,"
9775,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The voice, ""God's utmost blessing brims thy cup,"
9776,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"O, father of this child, look up, look up!"""
9777,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9778,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""Speak to my wife,"" the mariner replied."
9779,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""I have much work--right welcome work 'tis true--"
9780,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Another mouth to feed."" And then it sighed,"
9781,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""Woman, look up!"" She said, ""Make no ado,"
9782,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"For I must needs look down, on anywise,"
9783,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"My heaven is in the blue of these dear eyes."""
9784,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9785,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The seasons of the year did swiftly whirl,"
9786,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,They measured time by one small life alone;
9787,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"On such a day the pretty pushing pearl,"
9788,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"That mouth they loved to kiss had sweetly shown,"
9789,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"That smiling mouth, and it had made essay"
9790,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,To give them names on such another day.
9791,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9792,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And afterward his infant history,"
9793,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Whether he played with baubles on the floor,"
9794,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Or crept to pat the rock-doves pecking nigh,"
9795,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And feeding on the threshold of the door,"
9796,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"They loved to mark, and all his marvellings dim,"
9797,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,The mysteries that beguiled and baffled him.
9798,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9799,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"He was so sweet, that oft his mother said,"
9800,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""O, child, how was it that I dwelt content"
9801,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Before thou camest? Blessings on thy head,"
9802,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Thy pretty talk it is so innocent,"
9803,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"That oft for all my joy, though it be deep,"
9804,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"When thou art prattling, I am like to weep."""
9805,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9806,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Summer and winter spent themselves again,"
9807,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The rock-doves in their season bred, the cliff"
9808,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Grew sweet, for every cleft would entertain"
9809,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Its tuft of blossom, and the mariner's skiff,"
9810,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Early and late, would linger in the bay,"
9811,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Because the sea was calm and winds away.
9812,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9813,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The little child about that rocky height,"
9814,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Led by her loving hand who gave him birth,"
9815,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Might wander in the clear unclouded light,"
9816,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And take his pastime in the beauteous earth;
9817,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Smell the fair flowers in stony cradles swung,"
9818,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And see God's happy creatures feed their young.
9819,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9820,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And once it came to pass, at eventide,"
9821,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"His mother set him in the cavern door,"
9822,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And filled his lap with grain, and stood aside"
9823,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"To watch the circling rock-doves soar, and soar,"
9824,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Then dip, alight, and run in circling bands,"
9825,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,To take the barley from his open hands.
9826,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9827,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And even while she stood and gazed at him,"
9828,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And his grave father's eyes upon him dwelt,"
9829,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"They heard the tender voice, and it was dim,"
9830,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And seemed full softly in the air to melt;
9831,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""Father,"" it murmured, ""Mother,"" dying away,"
9832,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""Look up, while yet the hours are called to-day."""
9833,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9834,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""I will,"" the father answered, ""but not now;"""
9835,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The mother said, ""Sweet voice, O speak to me"
9836,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"At a convenient season."" And the brow"
9837,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Of the cliff began to quake right fearfully,"
9838,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"There was a rending crash, and there did leap"
9839,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,A riven rock and plunge into the deep.
9840,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9841,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"They said, ""A storm is coming;"" but they slept"
9842,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"That night in peace, and thought the storm had passed,"
9843,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,For there was not a cloud to intercept
9844,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,The sacred moonlight on the cradle cast;
9845,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And to his rocking boat at dawn of day,"
9846,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,With joy of heart the mariner took his way.
9847,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9848,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"But when he mounted up the path at night,"
9849,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Foreboding not of trouble or mischance,"
9850,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"His wife came out into the fading light,"
9851,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And met him with a serious countenance;
9852,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And she broke out in tears and sobbings thick,"
9853,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""The child is sick, my little child is sick."""
9854,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9855,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"They knelt beside him in the sultry dark,"
9856,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And when the moon looked in his face was pale,"
9857,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And when the red sun, like a burning barque,"
9858,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Rose in a fog at sea, his tender wail"
9859,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Sank deep into their hearts, and piteously"
9860,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,They fell to chiding of their destiny.
9861,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9862,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The doves unheeded cooed that livelong day,"
9863,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Their pretty playmate cared for them no more;
9864,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The sea-thrift nodded, wet with glistening spray,"
9865,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,None gathered it; the long wave washed the shore;
9866,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"He did not know, nor lift his eyes to trace,"
9867,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,The new fallen shadow in his dwelling-place.
9868,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9869,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The sultry sun beat on the cliffs all day,"
9870,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And hot calm airs slept on the polished sea,"
9871,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The mournful mother wore her time away,"
9872,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Bemoaning of her helpless misery,"
9873,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Pleading and plaining, till the day was done,"
9874,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""O look on me, my love, my little one."
9875,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9876,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""What aileth thee, that thou dost lie and moan?"
9877,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Ah would that I might bear it in thy stead!"""
9878,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The father made not his forebodings known,"
9879,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"But gazed, and in his secret soul he said,"
9880,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""I may have sinned, on sin waits punishment,"
9881,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"But as for him, sweet blameless innocent,"
9882,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9883,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""What has he done that he is stricken down?"
9884,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"O it is hard to see him sink and fade,"
9885,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"When I, that counted him my dear life's crown,"
9886,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,So willingly have worked while he has played;
9887,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"That he might sleep, have risen, come storm, come heat,"
9888,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And thankfully would fast that he might eat."""
9889,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9890,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"My God, how short our happy days appear!"
9891,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"How long the sorrowful! They thought it long,"
9892,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The sultry morn that brought such evil cheer,"
9893,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And sat, and wished, and sighed for evensong;"
9894,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"It came, and cooling wafts about him stirred,"
9895,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Yet when they spoke he answered not a word.
9896,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9897,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""Take heart,"" they cried, but their sad hearts sank low"
9898,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"When he would moan and turn his restless head,"
9899,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And wearily the lagging morns would go,"
9900,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And nights, while they sat watching by his bed,"
9901,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Until a storm came up with wind and rain,"
9902,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And lightning ran along the troubled main.
9903,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9904,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Over their heads the mighty thunders brake,"
9905,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Leaping and tumbling down from rock to rock,"
9906,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Then burst anew and made the cliffs to quake
9907,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,As they were living things and felt the shock;
9908,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The waiting sea to sob as if in pain,"
9909,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And all the midnight vault to ring again.
9910,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9911,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"A lamp was burning in the mariner's cave,"
9912,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,But the blue lightning flashes made it dim;
9913,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And when the mother heard those thunders rave,"
9914,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,She took her little child to cherish him;
9915,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"She took him in her arms, and on her breast"
9916,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Full wearily she courted him to rest,"
9917,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9918,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And soothed him long until the storm was spent,"
9919,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And the last thunder peal had died away,"
9920,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And stars were out in all the firmament.
9921,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Then did he cease to moan, and slumbering lay,"
9922,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"While in the welcome silence, pure and deep,"
9923,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,The care-worn parents sweetly fell asleep.
9924,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9925,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And in a dream, enwrought with fancies thick,"
9926,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,The mother thought she heard the rock-doves coo
9927,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"(She had forgotten that her child was sick),"
9928,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And she went forth their morning meal to strew;
9929,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Then over all the cliff with earnest care
9930,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"She sought her child, and lo, he was not there!"
9931,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9932,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"But she was not afraid, though long she sought"
9933,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And climbed the cliff, and set her feet in grass,"
9934,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Then reached a river, broad and full, she thought,"
9935,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And at its brink he sat. Alas! alas!
9936,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"For one stood near him, fair and undefiled,"
9937,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"An innocent, a marvellous man-child."
9938,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9939,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"In garments white as wool, and O, most fair,"
9940,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,A rainbow covered him with mystic light;
9941,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Upon the warmèd grass his feet were bare,"
9942,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And as he breathed, the rainbow in her sight"
9943,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"In passions of clear crimson trembling lay,"
9944,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,With gold and violet mist made fair the day.
9945,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9946,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Her little life! she thought, his little hands"
9947,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Were full of flowers that he did play withal;
9948,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"But when he saw the boy o' the golden lands,"
9949,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And looked him in the face, he let them fall,"
9950,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Held through a rapturous pause in wistful wise
9951,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,To the sweet strangeness of those keen child-eyes.
9952,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9953,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""Ah, dear and awful God, who chastenest me,"
9954,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,How shall my soul to this be reconciled!
9955,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"It is the Saviour of the world,"" quoth she,"
9956,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""And to my child He cometh as a child."""
9957,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Then on her knees she fell by that vast stream--
9958,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Oh, it was sorrowful, this woman's dream!"
9959,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9960,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"For lo, that Elder Child drew nearer now,"
9961,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Fair as the light, and purer than the sun."
9962,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The calms of heaven were brooding on his brow,"
9963,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And in his arms He took her little one,"
9964,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Her child, that knew her, but with sweet demur"
9965,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Drew back, nor held his hands to come to her."
9966,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9967,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,With that in mother misery sore she wept--
9968,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"""O Lamb of God, I love my child so MUCH!"
9969,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"He stole away to Thee while we two slept,"
9970,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"But give him back, for Thou hast many such;"
9971,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And as for me I have but one. O deign,"
9972,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Dear Pity of God, to give him me again."""
9973,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9974,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"His feet were on the river. Oh, his feet"
9975,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Had touched the river now, and it was great;"
9976,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And yet He hearkened when she did entreat,"
9977,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And turned in quietness as He would wait--
9978,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Wait till she looked upon Him, and behold,"
9979,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,There lay a long way off a city of gold.
9980,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9981,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Like to a jasper and a sardine stone,"
9982,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Whelmed in the rainbow stood that fair man-child,"
9983,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Mighty and innocent, that held her own,"
9984,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And as might be his manner at home he smiled,"
9985,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Then while she looked and looked, the vision brake,"
9986,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,And all amazed she started up awake.
9987,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9988,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"And lo, her little child was gone indeed!"
9989,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The sleep that knows no waking he had slept,"
9990,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,Folded to heaven's own heart; in rainbow brede
9991,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"Clothed and made glad, while they two mourned and wept,"
9992,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,But in the drinking of their bitter cup
9993,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The sweet voice spoke once more, and sighed, ""Look up!"""
9994,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,
9995,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"They heard, and straightway answered, ""Even so:"
9996,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,For what abides that we should look on here?
9997,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"The heavens are better than this earth below,"
9998,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,They are of more account and far more dear.
9999,THE MARINER'S CAVE.,"We will look up, for all most sweet and fair,"

10788,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Where its long reaches fade into the sky,"
10789,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Thy constant gaze, fair child, rests lovingly;"
10790,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,But neither thou nor any can descry
10791,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Aught but the grassy banks, the rustling sedge,"
10792,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And flocks of wild-fowl splashing at their edge.
10793,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10794,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And yet 'tis not with expectation hushed
10795,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,That thy mute rosy mouth doth pouting close;
10796,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"No fluttering hope to thy young heart e'er rushed,"
10797,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Nor disappointment troubled its repose;
10798,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,All satisfied with gazing evermore
10799,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Along the sunny Mere and reedy shore.
10800,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10801,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The brooding wren flies pertly near thy seat,"
10802,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Thou wilt not move to mark her glancing wing;
10803,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The timid sheep browse close before thy feet,"
10804,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And heedless at thy side do thrushes sing.
10805,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"So long amongst them thou hast spent thy days,"
10806,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,They know that harmless hand thou wilt not raise.
10807,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10808,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Thou wilt not lift it up--not e'en to take
10809,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The foxglove bells that nourish in the shade,"
10810,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And put them in thy bosom; not to make
10811,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,A posy of wild hyacinth inlaid
10812,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Like bright mosaic in the mossy grass,"
10813,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,With freckled orchis and pale sassafras.
10814,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10815,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Gaze on;--take in the voices of the Mere.
10816,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The break of shallow water at thy feet,"
10817,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Its plash among long weeds and grasses sere,"
10818,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And its weird sobbing,--hollow music meet"
10819,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"For ears like thine; listen and take thy till,"
10820,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And dream on it by night when all is still.
10821,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10822,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Full sixteen years have slowly passed away,"
10823,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Young Margaret, since thy fond mother here"
10824,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Came down, a six month's wife, one April day,"
10825,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"To see her husband's boat go down the Mere,"
10826,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And track its course, till, lost in distance blue,"
10827,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,In mellow light it faded from her view.
10828,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10829,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"It faded, and she never saw it more;--"
10830,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Nor any human eye;--oh, grief! oh, woe!"
10831,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"It faded,--and returned not to the shore;"
10832,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,But far above it still the waters flow--
10833,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And none beheld it sink, and none could tell"
10834,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Where coldly slept the form she loved so well!
10835,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10836,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"But that sad day, unknowing of her fate,"
10837,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,She homeward turn'd her still reluctant feet;
10838,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And at her wheel she spun, till dark and late"
10839,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,The evening fell--the time when they should meet;
10840,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Till the stars paled that at deep midnight burned--
10841,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And morning dawned, and he was not returned."
10842,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10843,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And the bright sun came up--she thought too soon--
10844,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And shed his ruddy light along the Mere;
10845,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And day wore on too quickly, and at noon"
10846,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,She came and wept beside the waters clear.
10847,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"""How could he be so late?""--and then hope fled;"
10848,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And disappointment darkened into dread.
10849,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10850,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"He NEVER came, and she with weepings sore"
10851,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Peered in the water-nags unceasingly;
10852,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Through all the undulations of the shore,"
10853,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Looking for that which most she feared to see.
10854,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And then she took home sorrow to her heart,"
10855,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And brooded over its cold cruel smart.
10856,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10857,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And after, desolate she sat alone"
10858,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And mourned, refusing to be comforted,"
10859,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"On the gray stone, the moss-embroidered stone,"
10860,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,With the great sycamore above her head;
10861,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Till after many days a broken oar
10862,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Hard by her seat was drifted to the shore.
10863,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10864,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"It came,--a token of his fate,--the whole,"
10865,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,The sum of her misfortune to reveal;
10866,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"As if sent up in pity to her soul,"
10867,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,The tidings of her widowhood to seal;
10868,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And put away the pining hope forlorn,"
10869,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,That made her grief more bitter to be borne.
10870,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10871,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And she was patient; through the weary day
10872,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,She toiled; though none was there her work to bless;
10873,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And did not wear the sullen months away,"
10874,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Nor call on death to end her wretchedness,"
10875,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"But lest the grief should overflow her breast,"
10876,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"She toiled as heretofore, and would not rest."
10877,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10878,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"But, her work done, what time the evening star"
10879,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Rose over the cool water, then she came"
10880,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"To the gray stone, and saw its light from far"
10881,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Drop down the misty Mere white lengths of flame,"
10882,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And wondered whether there might be the place
10883,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Where the soft ripple wandered o'er HIS face.
10884,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10885,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Unfortunate! In solitude forlorn
10886,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"She dwelt, and thought upon her husband's grave,"
10887,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Till when the days grew short a child was born
10888,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,To the dead father underneath the wave;
10889,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And it brought back a remnant of delight,"
10890,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,A little sunshine to its mother's sight;
10891,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10892,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"A little wonder to her heart grown numb,"
10893,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And a sweet yearning pitiful and keen:
10894,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"She took it as from that poor father come,"
10895,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Her and the misery to stand between;
10896,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Her little maiden babe, who day by day"
10897,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Sucked at her breast and charmed her woes away.
10898,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10899,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"But years flew on; the child was still the same,"
10900,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Nor human language she had learned to speak:
10901,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Her lips were mute, and seasons went and came,"
10902,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And brought fresh beauty to her tender cheek;
10903,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And all the day upon the sunny shore
10904,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,She sat and mused beneath the sycamore.
10905,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10906,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Strange sympathy! she watched and wearied not,"
10907,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Haply unconscious what it was she sought;
10908,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Her mother's tale she easily forgot,"
10909,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And if she listened no warm tears it brought;
10910,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Though surely in the yearnings of her heart
10911,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,The unknown voyager must have had his part.
10912,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10913,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Unknown to her; like all she saw unknown,"
10914,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"All sights were fresh as when they first began,"
10915,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,All sounds were new; each murmur and each tone
10916,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And cause and consequence she could not scan,"
10917,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Forgot that night brought darkness in its train,"
10918,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Nor reasoned that the day would come again.
10919,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10920,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,There is a happiness in past regret;
10921,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And echoes of the harshest sound are sweet.
10922,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The mother's soul was struck with grief, and yet,"
10923,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Repeated in her child, 'twas not unmeet"
10924,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,That echo-like the grief a tone should take
10925,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Painless, but ever pensive for her sake."
10926,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10927,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"For her dear sake, whose patient soul was linked"
10928,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,By ties so many to the babe unborn;
10929,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Whose hope, by slow degrees become extinct,"
10930,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"For evermore had left her child forlorn,"
10931,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Yet left no consciousness of want or woe,"
10932,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Nor wonder vague that these things should be so.
10933,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10934,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Truly her joys were limited and few,"
10935,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"But they sufficed a life to satisfy,"
10936,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"That neither fret nor dim foreboding knew,"
10937,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,But breathed the air in a great harmony
10938,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"With its own place and part, and was at one"
10939,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,With all it knew of earth and moon and sun.
10940,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10941,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"For all of them were worked into the dream,--"
10942,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,The husky sighs of wheat-fields in it wrought;
10943,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,All the land-miles belonged to it; the stream
10944,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,That fed the Mere ran through it like a thought.
10945,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"It was a passion of peace, and loved to wait"
10946,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,'Neath boughs with fair green light illuminate.
10947,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10948,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,To wait with her alone; always alone:
10949,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"For any that drew near she heeded not,"
10950,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Wanting them little as the lily grown
10951,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Apart from others in a shady plot,"
10952,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Wants fellow-lilies of like fair degree,"
10953,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,In her still glen to bear her company.
10954,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10955,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Always alone: and yet, there was a child"
10956,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Who loved this child, and, from his turret towers,"
10957,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Across the lea would roam to where, in-isled"
10958,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And fenced in rapturous silence, went her hours,"
10959,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And, with slow footsteps drawn anear the place"
10960,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Where mute she sat, would ponder on her face,"
10961,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10962,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And wonder at her with a childish awe,"
10963,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And come again to look, and yet again,"
10964,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Till the sweet rippling of the Mere would draw
10965,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,His longing to itself; while in her train
10966,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The water-hen, come forth, would bring her brood"
10967,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,From slumbering in the rushy solitude;
10968,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10969,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Or to their young would curlews call and clang
10970,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Their homeless young that down the furrows creep;
10971,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Or the wind-hover in the blue would hang,"
10972,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Still as a rock set in the watery deep.
10973,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Then from her presence he would break away,"
10974,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Unmarked, ungreeted yet, from day to day."
10975,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10976,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"But older grown, the Mere he haunted yet,"
10977,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And a strange joy from its sweet wildness caught;
10978,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Whilst careless sat alone maid Margaret,"
10979,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And ""shut the gates"" of silence on her thought,"
10980,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"All through spring mornings gemmed with melted rime,"
10981,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,All through hay-harvest and through gleaning time.
10982,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10983,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"O pleasure for itself that boyhood makes,"
10984,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"O happiness to roam the sighing shore,"
10985,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Plough up with elfin craft the water-flakes,"
10986,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And track the nested rail with cautious oar;
10987,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Then floating lie and look with wonder new
10988,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Straight up in the great dome of light and blue.
10989,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10990,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"O pleasure! yet they took him from the wold,"
10991,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The reedy Mere, and all his pastime there,"
10992,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The place where he was born, and would grow old"
10993,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,If God his life so many years should spare;
10994,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,From the loved haunts of childhood and the plain
10995,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And pasture-lands of his own broad domain.
10996,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
10997,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And he came down when wheat was in the sheaf,"
10998,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And with her fruit the apple-branch bent low,"
10999,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"While yet in August glory hung the leaf,"
11000,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And flowerless aftermath began to grow;
11001,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"He came from his gray turrets to the shore,"
11002,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And sought the maid beneath the sycamore.
11003,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11004,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"He sought her, not because her tender eyes"
11005,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Would brighten at his coming, for he knew"
11006,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Full seldom any thought of him would rise
11007,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,In her fair breast when he had passed from view;
11008,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"But for his own love's sake, that unbeguiled"
11009,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Drew him in spirit to the silent child.
11010,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11011,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,For boyhood in its better hour is prone
11012,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,To reverence what it hath not understood;
11013,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And he had thought some heavenly meaning shone
11014,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"From her clear eyes, that made their watchings good:"
11015,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,While a great peacefulness of shade was shed
11016,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Like oil of consecration on her head.
11017,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11018,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"A fishing wallet from his shoulder slung,"
11019,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"With bounding foot he reached the mossy place,"
11020,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"A little moment gently o'er her hung,"
11021,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Put back her hair and looked upon her face,"
11022,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Then fain from that deep dream to wake her yet,"
11023,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"He ""Margaret!"" low murmured, ""Margaret!"
11024,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11025,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"""Look at me once before I leave the land,"
11026,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"For I am going,--going, Margaret."""
11027,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And then she sighed, and, lifting up her hand,"
11028,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Laid it along his young fresh cheek, and set"
11029,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Upon his face those blue twin-deeps, her eyes,"
11030,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And moved it back from her in troubled wise,"
11031,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11032,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Because he came between her and her fate,"
11033,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,The Mere. She sighed again as one oppressed;
11034,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The waters, shining clear, with delicate"
11035,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Reflections wavered on her blameless breast;
11036,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And through the branches dropt, like flickerings fair,"
11037,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And played upon her hands and on her hair.
11038,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11039,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And he, withdrawn a little space to see,"
11040,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Murmured in tender ruth that was not pain,"
11041,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"""Farewell, I go; but sometimes think of me,"
11042,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Maid Margaret;"" and there came by again"
11043,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,A whispering in the reed-beds and the sway
11044,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Of waters: then he turned and went his way.
11045,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11046,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And wilt thou think on him now he is gone?
11047,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"No; thou wilt gaze: though thy young eyes grow dim,"
11048,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"And thy soft cheek become all pale and wan,"
11049,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Still thou wilt gaze, and spend no thought on him;"
11050,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,There is no sweetness in his laugh for thee--No
11051,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,beauty in his fresh heart's gayety.
11052,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11053,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,But wherefore linger in deserted haunts?
11054,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Why of the past, as if yet present, sing?"
11055,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The yellow iris on the margin flaunts,"
11056,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"With hyacinth the banks are blue in spring,"
11057,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And under dappled clouds the lark afloat
11058,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Pours all the April-tide from her sweet throat.
11059,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11060,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"But Margaret--ah! thou art there no more,"
11061,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And thick dank moss creeps over thy gray stone
11062,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Thy path is lost that skirted the low shore,"
11063,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,With willow-grass and speedwell overgrown;
11064,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Thine eye has closed for ever, and thine ear"
11065,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Drinks in no more the music of the Mere.
11066,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11067,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The boy shall come--shall come again in spring,"
11068,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Well pleased that pastoral solitude to share,"
11069,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And some kind offering in his hand will bring
11070,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"To cast into thy lap, O maid most fair--"
11071,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"Some clasping gem about thy neck to rest,"
11072,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Or heave and glimmer on thy guileless breast.
11073,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,
11074,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And he shall wonder why thou art not here
11075,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,"The solitude with ""smiles to entertain,"""
11076,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,And gaze along the reaches of the Mere;
11077,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,But he shall never see thy face again--
11078,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Shall never see upon the reedy shore
11079,MARGARET BY THE MERE SIDE.,Maid Margaret beneath her sycamore.

11106,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,A little maiden weeping on the ground;
11107,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11108,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And backward in the tent an aged crone
11109,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Upbraided her full harshly more and more,"
11110,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,But sunk her chiding to an undertone
11111,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"When she beheld him standing at the door,"
11112,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And calmed her voice, and dropped her lifted hand,"
11113,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And answered him with accent soft and bland.
11114,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11115,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"No, the young child was none of hers, she said,"
11116,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,But she had found her where the ash lay white
11117,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,About a smouldering tent; her infant head
11118,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"All shelterless, she through the dewy night"
11119,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Had slumbered on the field,--ungentle fate"
11120,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,For a lone child so soft and delicate.
11121,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11122,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""And I,"" quoth she, ""have tended her with care,"
11123,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And thought to be rewarded of her kin,"
11124,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,For by her rich attire and features fair
11125,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,I know her birth is gentle: yet within
11126,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The tent unclaimed she doth but pine and weep,"
11127,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"A burden I would fain no longer keep."""
11128,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11129,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Still while she spoke the little creature wept,"
11130,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Till painful pity touched him for the flow
11131,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of all those tears, and to his heart there crept"
11132,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"A yearning as of fatherhood, and lo!"
11133,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Reaching his arms to her, ""My sweet,"" quoth he,"
11134,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""Dear little madam, wilt thou come with me?"""
11135,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11136,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then she left off her crying, and a look"
11137,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Of wistful wonder stole into her eyes.
11138,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The sullen frown her dimpled face forsook,"
11139,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She let him take her, and forgot her sighs,"
11140,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Contented in his alien arms to rest,"
11141,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And lay her baby head upon his breast.
11142,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11143,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Ah, sure a stranger trust was never sought"
11144,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,By any soldier on a battle-plain.
11145,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"He brought her to his tent, and soothed his voice,"
11146,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Rough with command; and asked, but all in vain,"
11147,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Her story, while her prattling tongue rang sweet,"
11148,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She playing, as one at home, about his feet."
11149,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11150,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of race, of country, or of parentage,"
11151,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Her lisping accents nothing could unfold;--
11152,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,No questioning could win to read the page
11153,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of her short life;--she left her tale untold,"
11154,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And home and kin thus early to forget,"
11155,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She only knew,--her name was--Margaret."
11156,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11157,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Then in the dusk upon his arm it chanced
11158,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,That night that suddenly she fell asleep;
11159,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And he looked down on her like one entranced,"
11160,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And listened to her breathing still and deep,"
11161,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"As if a little child, when daylight closed,"
11162,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,With half-shut lids had ne'er before reposed.
11163,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11164,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Softly he laid her down from off his arm,"
11165,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,With earnest care and new-born tenderness:
11166,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Her infancy, a wonder-working charm,"
11167,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Laid hold upon his love; he stayed to bless
11168,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The small sweet head, then went he forth that night"
11169,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And sought a nurse to tend this new delight.
11170,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11171,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And day by day his heart she wrought upon,"
11172,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And won her way into its inmost fold--
11173,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"A heart which, but for lack of that whereon"
11174,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"To fix itself, would never have been cold;"
11175,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And, opening wide, now let her come to dwell"
11176,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Within its strong unguarded citadel.
11177,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11178,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She, like a dream, unlocked the hidden springs"
11179,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of his past thoughts, and set their current free"
11180,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,To talk with him of half-forgotten things--
11181,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The pureness and the peace of infancy,"
11182,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""Thou also, thou,"" to sigh, ""wert undefiled"
11183,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"(O God, the change!) once, as this little child."""
11184,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11185,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The baby-mistress of a soldier's heart,"
11186,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She had but friendlessness to stand her friend,"
11187,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And her own orphanhood to plead her part,"
11188,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"When he, a wayfarer, did pause, and bend,"
11189,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And bear with him the starry blossom sweet
11190,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Out of its jeopardy from trampling feet.
11191,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11192,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"A gleam of light upon a rainy day,"
11193,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"A new-tied knot that must be sever'd soon,"
11194,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"At sunrise once before his tent at play,"
11195,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And hurried from the battle-field at noon,"
11196,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"While face to face in hostile ranks they stood,"
11197,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Who should have dwelt in peace and brotherhood.
11198,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11199,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But ere the fight, when higher rose the sun,"
11200,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And yet were distant far the rebel bands,"
11201,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She heard at intervals a booming gun,"
11202,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And she was pleased, and laughing clapped her hands;"
11203,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Till he came in with troubled look and tone,"
11204,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Who chose her desolate to be his own.
11205,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11206,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And he said, ""Little madam, now farewell,"
11207,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,For there will be a battle fought ere night.
11208,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"God be thy shield, for He alone can tell"
11209,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Which way may fall the fortune of the fight.
11210,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"To fitter hands the care of thee pertain,"
11211,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"My dear, if we two never meet again."""
11212,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11213,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then he gave money shortly to her nurse,"
11214,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And charged her straitly to depart in haste,"
11215,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And leave the plain, whereon the deadly curse"
11216,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of war should light with ruin, death, and waste,"
11217,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And all the ills that must its presence blight,"
11218,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,E'en if proud victory should bless the right.
11219,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11220,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""But if the rebel cause should prosper, then"
11221,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,It were not good among the hills to wend;
11222,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But journey through to Boston in the fen,"
11223,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And wait for peace, if peace our God shall send;"
11224,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And if my life is spared, I will essay,"""
11225,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Quoth he, ""to join you there as best I may."""
11226,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11227,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"So then he kissed the child, and went his way;"
11228,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,But many troubles rolled above his head;
11229,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The sun arose on many an evil day,"
11230,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And cruel deeds were done, and tears were shed;"
11231,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And hope was lost, and loyal hearts were fain"
11232,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"In dust to hide,--ere they two met again."
11233,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11234,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"So passed the little child from thought, from view--"
11235,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"(The snowdrop blossoms, and then is not there,"
11236,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Forgotten till men welcome it anew),"
11237,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"He found her in his heavy days of care,"
11238,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And with her dimples was again beguiled,"
11239,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,As on her nurse's knee she sat and smiled.
11240,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11241,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And he became a voyager by sea,"
11242,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And took the child to share his wandering state;
11243,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Since from his native land compelled to flee,"
11244,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And hopeless to avert her monarch's fate;
11245,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"For all was lost that might have made him pause,"
11246,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And, past a soldier's help, the royal cause."
11247,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11248,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And thus rolled on long days, long months and years,"
11249,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And Margaret within the Xebec sailed;
11250,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The lulling wind made music in her ears,"
11251,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And nothing to her life's completeness failed.
11252,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Her pastime 'twas to see the dolphins spring,"
11253,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And wonderful live rainbows glimmering.
11254,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11255,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The gay sea-plants familiar were to her,"
11256,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,As daisies to the children of the land;
11257,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Red wavy dulse the sunburnt mariner
11258,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Raised from its bed to glisten in her hand;
11259,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The vessel and the sea were her life's stage--
11260,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Her house, her garden, and her hermitage."
11261,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11262,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Also she had a cabin of her own,"
11263,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"For beauty like an elfin palace bright,"
11264,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"With Venice glass adorned, and crystal stone"
11265,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,That trembled with a many-colored light;
11266,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And there with two caged ringdoves she did play,"
11267,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And feed them carefully from day to day.
11268,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11269,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Her bed with silken curtains was enclosed,"
11270,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,White as the snowy rose of Guelderland;
11271,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"On Turkish pillows her young head reposed,"
11272,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And love had gathered with a careful hand
11273,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Fair playthings to the little maiden's side,"
11274,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"From distant ports, and cities parted wide."
11275,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11276,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She had two myrtle-plants that she did tend,"
11277,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And think all trees were like to them that grew;
11278,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"For things on land she did confuse and blend,"
11279,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And chiefly from the deck the land she knew,"
11280,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And in her heart she pitied more and more
11281,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The steadfast dwellers on the changeless shore.
11282,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11283,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Green fields and inland meadows faded out
11284,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of mind, or with sea-images were linked;"
11285,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And yet she had her childish thoughts about
11286,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The country she had left--though indistinct
11287,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And faint as mist the mountain-head that shrouds,"
11288,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Or dim through distance as Magellan's clouds.
11289,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11290,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And when to frame a forest scene she tried,"
11291,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The ever-present sea would yet intrude,"
11292,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And all her towns were by the water's side,"
11293,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"It murmured in all moorland solitude,"
11294,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Where rocks and the ribbed sand would intervene,"
11295,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And waves would edge her fancied village green;
11296,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11297,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Because her heart was like an ocean shell,"
11298,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"That holds (men say) a message from the deep,"
11299,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And yet the land was strong, she knew its spell,"
11300,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And harbor lights could draw her in her sleep;
11301,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And minster chimes from piercèd towers that swim,"
11302,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Were the land-angels making God a hymn.
11303,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11304,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"So she grew on, the idol of one heart,"
11305,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And the delight of many--and her face,"
11306,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Thus dwelling chiefly from her sex apart,"
11307,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Was touched with a most deep and tender grace--
11308,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"A look that never aught but nature gave,"
11309,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Artless, yet thoughtful; innocent, yet grave."
11310,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11311,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Strange her adornings were, and strangely blent:"
11312,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,A golden net confined her nut-brown hair;
11313,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Quaint were the robes that divers lands had lent,"
11314,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And quaint her aged nurse's skill and care;
11315,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Yet did they well on the sea-maiden meet,"
11316,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Circle her neck, and grace her dimpled feet."
11317,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11318,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The sailor folk were glad because of her,"
11319,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And deemed good fortune followed in her wake;
11320,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She was their guardian saint, they did aver--"
11321,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Prosperous winds were sent them for her sake;
11322,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And strange rough vows, strange prayers, they nightly made,"
11323,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"While, storm or calm, she slept, in nought afraid."
11324,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11325,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Clear were her eyes, that daughter of the sea,"
11326,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Sweet, when uplifted to her aged nurse,"
11327,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She sat, and communed what the world could be;"
11328,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And rambling stories caused her to rehearse
11329,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"How Yule was kept, how maidens tossed the hay,"
11330,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And how bells rang upon a wedding day.
11331,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11332,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,But they grew brighter when the evening star
11333,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"First trembled over the still glowing wave,"
11334,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"That bathed in ruddy light, mast, sail, and spar;"
11335,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"For then, reclined in rest that twilight gave,"
11336,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"With him who served for father, friend, and guide,"
11337,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,She sat upon the deck at eventide.
11338,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11339,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then turned towards the west, that on her hair"
11340,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And her young cheek shed down its tender glow,"
11341,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,He taught her many things with earnest care
11342,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"That he thought fitting a young maid should know,"
11343,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Told of the good deeds of the worthy dead,"
11344,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And prayers devout, by faithful martyrs said."
11345,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11346,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And many psalms he caused her to repeat
11347,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And sing them, at his knees reclined the while,"
11348,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And spoke with her of all things good and meet,"
11349,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And told the story of her native isle,"
11350,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Till at the end he made her tears to flow,"
11351,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Rehearsing of his royal master's woe.
11352,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11353,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And of the stars he taught her, and their names,"
11354,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And how the chartless mariner they guide;
11355,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of quivering light that in the zenith flames,"
11356,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Of monsters in the deep sea caves that hide;
11357,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then changed the theme to fairy records wild,"
11358,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Enchanted moor, elf dame, or changeling child."
11359,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11360,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"To her the Eastern lands their strangeness spread,"
11361,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The dark-faced Arab in his long blue gown,"
11362,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The camel thrusting down a snake-like head
11363,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,To browse on thorns outside a walled white town.
11364,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Where palmy clusters rank by rank upright
11365,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Float as in quivering lakes of ribbed light.
11366,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11367,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And when the ship sat like a broad-winged bird
11368,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Becalmed, lo, lions answered in the night"
11369,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Their fellows, all the hollow dark was stirred"
11370,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"To echo on that tremulous thunder's flight,"
11371,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Dying in weird faint moans;--till look: the sun
11372,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And night, and all the things of night, were done."
11373,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11374,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And they, toward the waste as morning brake,"
11375,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Turned, where, in-isled in his green watered land,"
11376,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The Lybian Zeus lay couched of old, and spake,"
11377,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Hemmed in with leagues of furrow-faced sand--
11378,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Then saw the moon (like Joseph's golden cup
11379,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Come back) behind some ruined roof swim up.
11380,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11381,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But blooming childhood will not always last,"
11382,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And storms will rise e'en on the tideless sea;
11383,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"His guardian love took fright, she grew so fast,"
11384,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And he began to think how sad 'twould be
11385,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"If he should die, and pirate hordes should get"
11386,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,By sword or shipwreck his fair Margaret.
11387,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11388,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"It was a sudden thought; but he gave way,"
11389,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,For it assailed him with unwonted force;
11390,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And, with no more than one short week's delay,"
11391,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,For English shores he shaped the vessel's course;
11392,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And ten years absent saw her landed now,"
11393,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,With thirteen summers on her maiden brow.
11394,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11395,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And so he journeyed with her, far inland,"
11396,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Down quiet lanes, by hedges gemmed with dew,"
11397,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Where wonders met her eye on every hand,"
11398,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And all was beautiful and strange and new--
11399,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"All, from the forest trees in stately ranks,"
11400,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,To yellow cowslips trembling on the banks.
11401,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11402,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"All new--the long-drawn slope of evening shades,"
11403,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The sweet solemnities of waxing light,"
11404,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The white-haired boys, the blushing rustic maids,"
11405,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The ruddy gleam through cottage casements bright,"
11406,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The green of pastures, bloom of garden nooks,"
11407,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And endless bubbling of the water-brooks.
11408,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11409,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"So far he took them on through this green land,"
11410,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The maiden and her nurse, till journeying"
11411,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,They saw at last a peaceful city stand
11412,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"On a steep mount, and heard its clear bells ring."
11413,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"High were the towers and rich with ancient state,"
11414,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,In its old wall enclosed and massive gate.
11415,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11416,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"There dwelt a worthy matron whom he knew,"
11417,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"To whom in time of war he gave good aid,"
11418,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Shielding her household from the plundering crew
11419,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"When neither law could bind nor worth persuade,"
11420,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And to her house he brought his care and pride,"
11421,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Aweary with the way and sleepy-eyed.
11422,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11423,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And he, the man whom she was fain to serve,"
11424,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Delayed not shortly his request to make,"
11425,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Which was, if aught of her he did deserve,"
11426,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"To take the maid, and rear her for his sake,"
11427,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"To guard her youth, and let her breeding be"
11428,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,In womanly reserve and modesty.
11429,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11430,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And that same night into the house he brought
11431,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The costly fruits of all his voyages--
11432,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Rich Indian gems of wandering craftsmen wrought,"
11433,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Long ropes of pearls from Persian palaces,"
11434,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"With ingots pure and coins of Venice mould,"
11435,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And silver bars and bags of Spanish gold;
11436,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11437,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And costly merchandise of far-off lands,"
11438,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And golden stuffs and shawls of Eastern dye,"
11439,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"He gave them over to the matron's hands,"
11440,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"With jewelled gauds, and toys of ivory,"
11441,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"To be her dower on whom his love was set,--"
11442,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"His dearest child, fair Madam Margaret."
11443,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11444,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then he entreated, that if he should die,"
11445,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,She would not cease her guardian mission mild.
11446,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Awhile, as undecided, lingered nigh,"
11447,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Beside the pillow of the sleeping child,"
11448,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Severed one wandering lock of wavy hair,"
11449,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Took horse that night, and left her unaware."
11450,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11451,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And it was long before he came again--
11452,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,So long that Margaret was woman grown;
11453,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And oft she wished for his return in vain,"
11454,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Calling him softly in an undertone;
11455,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Repeating words that he had said the while,"
11456,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And striving to recall his look and smile.
11457,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11458,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"If she had known--oh, if she could have known--"
11459,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The toils, the hardships of those absent years--"
11460,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,How bitter thraldom forced the unwilling groan--
11461,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"How slavery wrung out subduing tears,"
11462,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Not calmly had she passed her hours away,"
11463,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Chiding half pettishly the long delay.
11464,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11465,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But she was spared. She knew no sense of harm,"
11466,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,While the red flames ascended from the deck;
11467,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Saw not the pirate band the crew disarm,"
11468,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Mourned not the floating spars, the smoking wreck."
11469,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She did not dream, and there was none to tell,"
11470,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,That fetters bound the hands she loved so well.
11471,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11472,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Sweet Margaret--withdrawn from human view,"
11473,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She spent long hours beneath the cedar shade,"
11474,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The stately trees that in the garden grew,"
11475,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And, overtwined, a towering shelter made;"
11476,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She mused among the flowers, and birds, and bees,"
11477,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"In winding walks, and bowering canopies;"
11478,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11479,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Or wandered slowly through the ancient rooms,"
11480,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Where oriel windows shed their rainbow gleams;
11481,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And tapestried hangings, wrought in Flemish looms,"
11482,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Displayed the story of King Pharaoh's dreams;
11483,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And, come at noon because the well was deep,"
11484,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Beautiful Rachel leading down her sheep.
11485,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11486,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"At last she reached the bloom of womanhood,"
11487,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,After five summers spent in growing fair;
11488,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Her face betokened all things dear and good,"
11489,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The light of somewhat yet to come was there
11490,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Asleep, and waiting for the opening day,"
11491,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"When childish thoughts, like flowers, would drift away."
11492,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11493,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,O! we are far too happy while they last;
11494,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"We have our good things first, and they cost naught;"
11495,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then the new splendor comes unfathomed, vast,"
11496,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"A costly trouble, ay, a sumptuous thought,"
11497,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And will not wait, and cannot be possessed,"
11498,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Though infinite yearnings fold it to the breast.
11499,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11500,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And time, that seemed so long, is fleeting by,"
11501,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And life is more than life; love more than love;
11502,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,We have not found the whole--and we must die--
11503,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And still the unclasped glory floats above.
11504,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The inmost and the utmost faint from sight,"
11505,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,For ever secret in their veil of light.
11506,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11507,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Be not too hasty in your flow, you rhymes,"
11508,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,For Margaret is in her garden bower;
11509,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Delay to ring, you soft cathedral chimes,"
11510,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And tell not out too soon the noontide hour:
11511,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"For one draws nearer to your ancient town,"
11512,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,On the green mount down settled like a crown.
11513,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11514,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"He journeyed on, and, as he neared the gate,"
11515,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"He met with one to whom he named the maid,"
11516,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Inquiring of her welfare and her state.
11517,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And of the matron in whose house she stayed.
11518,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""The maiden dwelt there yet,"" the townsman said;"
11519,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""But, for the ancient lady,--she was dead."""
11520,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11521,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"He further said, she was but little known,"
11522,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Although reputed to be very fair,"
11523,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And little seen (so much she dwelt alone)
11524,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,But with her nurse at stated morning prayer;
11525,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"So seldom passed her sheltering garden wall,"
11526,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Or left the gate at quiet evening fall.
11527,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11528,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Flow softly, rhymes--his hand is on the door;"
11529,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Ring out, ye noonday bells, his welcoming--"
11530,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""He went out rich, but he returneth poor;"""
11531,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And strong--now something bowed with suffering.
11532,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And on his brow are traced long furrowed lines,"
11533,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Earned in the fight with pirate Algerines.
11534,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11535,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Her aged nurse comes hobbling at his call;
11536,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Lifts up her withered hand in dull surprise,"
11537,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And, tottering, leads him through the pillared hall;"
11538,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""What! come at last to bless my lady's eyes!"
11539,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Dear heart, sweet heart, she's grown a likesome maid--"
11540,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Go, seek her where she sitteth in the shade."""
11541,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11542,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The noonday chime had ceased--she did not know
11543,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Who watched her, while her ringdoves fluttered near:"
11544,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"While, under the green boughs, in accents low"
11545,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,She sang unto herself. She did not hear
11546,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"His footstep till she turned, then rose to meet"
11547,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Her guest with guileless blush and wonder sweet.
11548,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11549,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But soon she knew him, came with quickened pace,"
11550,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And put her gentle hands about his neck;
11551,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And leaned her fair cheek to his sun-burned face,"
11552,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,As long ago upon the vessel's deck:
11553,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"As long ago she did in twilight deep,"
11554,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,When heaving waters lulled her infant sleep.
11555,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11556,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"So then he kissed her, as men kiss their own,"
11557,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And, proudly parting her unbraided hair,"
11558,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"He said: ""I did not think to see thee grown"
11559,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"So fair a woman,""--but a touch of care"
11560,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The deep-toned voice through its caressing kept,"
11561,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And, hearing it, she turned away and wept."
11562,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11563,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Wept,--for an impress on the face she viewed--"
11564,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The stamp of feelings she remembered not;
11565,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"His voice was calmer now, but more subdued,"
11566,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Not like the voice long loved and unforgot!
11567,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,She felt strange sorrow and delightful pain--
11568,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Grief for the change, joy that he came again."
11569,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11570,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"O pleasant days, that followed his return,"
11571,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,That made his captive years pass out of mind;
11572,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"If life had yet new pains for him to learn,"
11573,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Not in the maid's clear eyes he saw it shrined;
11574,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And three full weeks he stayed with her, content"
11575,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,To find her beautiful and innocent.
11576,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11577,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,It was all one in his contented sight
11578,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"As though she were a child, till suddenly,"
11579,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Waked of the chimes in the dead time of the night,"
11580,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,He fell to thinking how the urgency
11581,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of Fate had dealt with him, and could but sigh"
11582,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,For those best things wherein she passed him by.
11583,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11584,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Down the long river of life how, cast adrift,"
11585,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She urged him on, still on, to sink or swim;"
11586,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And all at once, as if a veil did lift,"
11587,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"In the dead time of the night, and bare to him"
11588,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The want in his deep soul, he looked, was dumb,"
11589,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And knew himself, and knew his time was come."
11590,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11591,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,In the dead time of the night his soul did sound
11592,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The dark sea of a trouble unforeseen,"
11593,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,For that one sweet that to his life was bound
11594,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Had turned into a want--a misery keen:
11595,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Was born, was grown, and wounded sorely cried"
11596,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,All 'twixt the midnight and the morning tide.
11597,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11598,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"He was a brave man, and he took this thing"
11599,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And cast it from him with a man's strong hand;
11600,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And that next morn, with no sweet altering"
11601,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of mien, beside the maid he took his stand,"
11602,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And copied his past self till ebbing day
11603,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Paled its deep western blush, and died away."
11604,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11605,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And then he told her that he must depart
11606,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Upon the morrow, with the earliest light;"
11607,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And it displeased and pained her at the heart,"
11608,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And she went out to hide her from his sight
11609,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Aneath the cedar trees, where dusk was deep,"
11610,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And be apart from him awhile to weep
11611,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11612,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And to lament, till, suddenly aware"
11613,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of steps, she started up as fain to flee,"
11614,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And met him in the moonlight pacing there,"
11615,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Who questioned with her why her tears might be,"
11616,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Till she did answer him, all red for shame,"
11617,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""Kind sir, I weep--the wanting of a name."""
11618,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11619,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""A name!"" quoth he, and sighed. ""I never knew"
11620,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Thy father's name; but many a stalwart youth
11621,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Would give thee his, dear child, and his love too,"
11622,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And count himself a happy man forsooth.
11623,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Is there none here who thy kind thought hath won?"""
11624,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But she did falter, and made answer, ""None."""
11625,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11626,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then, as in father-like and kindly mood,"
11627,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"He said, ""Dear daughter, it would please me well"
11628,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,To see thee wed; for know it is not good
11629,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"That a fair woman thus alone should dwell."""
11630,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She said, ""I am content it should be so,"
11631,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"If when you journey I may with you go."""
11632,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11633,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"This when he heard, he thought, right sick at heart,"
11634,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Must I withstand myself, and also thee?"
11635,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Thou, also thou! must nobly do thy part;"
11636,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,That honor leads thee on which holds back me.
11637,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"No, thou sweet woman; by love's great increase,"
11638,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,I will reject thee for thy truer peace.
11639,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11640,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then said he, ""Lady!--look upon my face;"
11641,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Consider well this scar upon my brow;
11642,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,I have had all misfortune but disgrace;
11643,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,I do not look for marriage blessings now.
11644,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Be not thy gratitude deceived. I know
11645,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Thou think'st it is thy duty--I will go!
11646,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11647,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""I read thy meaning, and I go from hence,"
11648,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Skilled in the reason; though my heart be rude,"
11649,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"I will not wrong thy gentle innocence,"
11650,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Nor take advantage of thy gratitude.
11651,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But think, while yet the light these eyes shall bless,"
11652,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The more for thee--of woman's nobleness."""
11653,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11654,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Faultless and fair, all in the moony light,"
11655,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"As one ashamed, she looked upon the ground,"
11656,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And her white raiment glistened in his sight.
11657,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And, hark! the vesper chimes began to sound,"
11658,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then lower yet she drooped her young, pure cheek,"
11659,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And still was she ashamed, and could not speak."
11660,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11661,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"A swarm of bells from that old tower o'erhead,"
11662,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,They sent their message sifting through the boughs
11663,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of cedars; when they ceased his lady said,"
11664,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""Pray you forgive me,"" and her lovely brows"
11665,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She lifted, standing in her moonlit place,"
11666,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And one short moment looked him in the face.
11667,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11668,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then straight he cried, ""O sweetheart, think all one"
11669,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"As no word yet were said between us twain,"
11670,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And know thou that in this I yield to none--
11671,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"love thee, sweetheart, love thee!"" So full fain,"
11672,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"While she did leave to silence all her part,"
11673,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,He took the gleaming whiteness to his heart--
11674,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11675,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The white-robed maiden with the warm white throat,"
11676,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"The sweet white brow, and locks of umber flow,"
11677,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Whose murmuring voice was soft as rock-dove's note,"
11678,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Entreating him, and saying, ""Do not go!"""
11679,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""I will not, sweetheart; nay, not now,"" quoth he,"
11680,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""By faith and troth, I think thou art for me!"""
11681,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11682,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And so she won a name that eventide,"
11683,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Which he gave gladly, but would ne'er bespeak,"
11684,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And she became the rough sea-captain's bride,"
11685,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Matching her dimples to his sunburnt cheek;
11686,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And chasing from his voice the touch of care,"
11687,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,That made her weep when first she heard it there.
11688,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11689,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"One year there was, fulfilled of happiness,"
11690,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But O! it went so fast, too fast away."
11691,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Then came that trouble which full oft doth bless--
11692,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"It was the evening of a sultry day,"
11693,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"There was no wind the thread-hung flowers to stir,"
11694,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Or float abroad the filmy gossamer.
11695,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11696,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Toward the trees his steps the mariner bent,"
11697,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Pacing the grassy walks with restless feet:
11698,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And he recalled, and pondered as he went,"
11699,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"All her most duteous love and converse sweet,"
11700,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Till summer darkness settled deep and dim,"
11701,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And dew from bending leaves dropt down on him.
11702,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11703,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The flowers sent forth their nightly odors faint--
11704,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Thick leaves shut out the starlight overhead;
11705,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"While he told over, as by strong constraint"
11706,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Drawn on, her childish life on shipboard led,"
11707,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And beauteous youth, since first low kneeling there,"
11708,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,With folded hands she lisped her evening prayer.
11709,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11710,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then he remembered how, beneath the shade,"
11711,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"She wooed him to her with her lovely words,"
11712,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"While flowers were closing, leaves in moonlight played,"
11713,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,And in dark nooks withdrew the silent birds.
11714,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"So pondered he that night in twilight dim,"
11715,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,While dew from bending leaves dropt down on him.
11716,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11717,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,The flowers sent forth their nightly odors faint--
11718,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"When, in the darkness waiting, he saw one"
11719,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"To whom he said--""How fareth my sweet saint?"""
11720,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Who answered--""She hath borne to you a son;"""
11721,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Then, turning, left him,--and the father said,"
11722,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"""God rain down blessings on his welcome head!"""
11723,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,
11724,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But Margaret!--_she_ never saw the child,"
11725,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Nor heard about her bed love's mournful wails;
11726,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"But to the last, with ocean dreams beguiled,"
11727,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,Murmured of troubled seas and swelling sails--
11728,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"Of weary voyages, and rocks unseen,"
11729,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,"And distant hills in sight, all calm and green...."
11730,MARGARET IN THE XEBEC.,

12429,BOOK II,"""Behold, I prophesy."""
12430,BOOK II,Then straight they fled

12660,BOOK III.,

12671,BOOK III.,

12673,BOOK III.,That while at dead of night the old dragon lay
12674,BOOK III.,"Coiled in the cavern where he dwelt, the watch"

12680,BOOK III.,
12681,BOOK III.,Now there was drawn a curtain nigh the mouth
12682,BOOK III.,"Of that deep cave, to testify of wrath."
12683,BOOK III.,"The dragon had been wroth with some that served,"
12684,BOOK III.,"And chased them from him; and his oracles,"
12685,BOOK III.,"That wont to drop from him, were stopped, and men"
12686,BOOK III.,Might only pray to him through that fell web
12687,BOOK III.,That hung before him. Then did whisper low
12688,BOOK III.,Some of the little spirits that bat-like clung

12719,BOOK III.,"And farther back, within the rock hewn out,"
12720,BOOK III.,"Angelic figures stood, that impious hands"
12721,BOOK III.,Had fashioned; many golden lamps they held
12722,BOOK III.,"By golden chains depending, and their eyes"
12723,BOOK III.,All tended in a reverend quietude
12724,BOOK III.,Toward the couch whereon the dragon lay.
12725,BOOK III.,The floor was beaten gold; the curly lengths
12726,BOOK III.,"Of his last coils lay on it, hid from sight"
12727,BOOK III.,"With a coverlet made stiff with crusting gems,"
12728,BOOK III.,"Fire opals shooting, rubies, fierce bright eyes"
12729,BOOK III.,"Of diamonds, or the pale green emerald,"
12730,BOOK III.,That changed their lustre when he breathed.
12731,BOOK III.,
12732,BOOK III.,His head
12733,BOOK III.,"Feathered with crimson combs, and all his neck,"
12734,BOOK III.,"And half-shut fans of his admired wings,"
12735,BOOK III.,That in their scaly splendor put to shame
12736,BOOK III.,"Or gold or stone, lay on his ivory couch"
12737,BOOK III.,And shivered; for the dragon suffered pain:
12738,BOOK III.,"He suffered and he feared. It was his doom,"

12744,BOOK III.,
12745,BOOK III.,"But with its nature wed, as souls of men"

12775,BOOK III.,"From inner chambers, lovely ministrants,"
12776,BOOK III.,"Young boys, with radiant locks and peaceful eyes,"
12777,BOOK III.,"And poured out liquor from their cups, to cool"
12778,BOOK III.,"His parched tongue, and kneeling held it nigh"
12779,BOOK III.,"In jewelled basins sparkling; and he lapped,"
12780,BOOK III.,"And was appeased, and said, ""I will not hide"
12781,BOOK III.,"Longer, my much desired face from men."
12782,BOOK III.,"Draw back the web of separation."" Then"
12783,BOOK III.,"With cries of gratulation ran they forth,"
12784,BOOK III.,"And flung it wide, and all the watch fell low,"
12785,BOOK III.,"Each on his face, as drunk with sudden joy."
12786,BOOK III.,"Thus marked he, glowing on the branched moss,"
12787,BOOK III.,"Those red rare moons, and let his serpent eyes"
12788,BOOK III.,"Consider them full subtly, ""What be these?"""

12790,BOOK III.,"""As we for thy protection (having heard"
12791,BOOK III.,"That wrathful sons of darkness walk, to-night,"
12792,BOOK III.,"Such as do oft ill use us), clustered here,"

12794,BOOK III.,"And furrowed up like spray a billowy cloud,"
12795,BOOK III.,"And, lo, it went to pieces, scattering down"
12796,BOOK III.,"A rain of sparks and these two angry moons."""
12797,BOOK III.,"Then said the dragon, ""Let my guard, and you,"
12798,BOOK III.,"Attendant hosts, recede""; and they went back,"
12799,BOOK III.,"And formed about the cave a widening ring,"
12800,BOOK III.,"Then halting, stood afar; and from the cave"
12801,BOOK III.,"The snaky wonder spoke, with hissing tongue,"
12802,BOOK III.,"""If ye were Tartis and Deleisonon,"
12803,BOOK III.,"Be Tartis and Deleisonon once more."""
12804,BOOK III.,
12805,BOOK III.,"Then egg-like cracked the glowing balls, and forth"
12806,BOOK III.,"Started black angels, trampling hard to free"
12807,BOOK III.,Their fettered feet from out the smoking shell.
12808,BOOK III.,
12809,BOOK III.,"And he said, ""Tartis and Deleisonon,"
12810,BOOK III.,"Your lord I am: draw nigh."" ""Thou art our lord,"""
12811,BOOK III.,"They answered, and with fettered limbs full low"
12812,BOOK III.,"They bent, and made obeisance. Furthermore,"
12813,BOOK III.,"""O fiery flying serpent, after whom"
12814,BOOK III.,"The nations go, let thy dominion last,"""
12815,BOOK III.,"They said, ""forever."" And the serpent said,"
12816,BOOK III.,"""It shall: unfold your errand."" They replied,"
12817,BOOK III.,"One speaking for a space, and afterward"
12818,BOOK III.,His fellow taking up the word with fear
12819,BOOK III.,"And panting, ""We were set to watch the mouth"
12820,BOOK III.,Of great Methuselah. There came to him
12821,BOOK III.,"The son of Lamech two days since. My lord,"
12822,BOOK III.,"They prophesied, the Elder prophesied,"
12823,BOOK III.,"Unwitting, of the flood of waters,--ay,"
12824,BOOK III.,"A vision was before him, and the lands"
12825,BOOK III.,"Lay under water drowned: he saw the ark,--"
12826,BOOK III.,"It floated in the Enemy's right hand."""
12827,BOOK III.,"Lord of the lost, the son of Lamech fled"

12830,BOOK III.,"Aught that might serve thee, followed, but, forbid"
12831,BOOK III.,"To enter, lay upon its boundary cliff,"
12832,BOOK III.,And wished for morning.
12833,BOOK III.,
12834,BOOK III.,"""When the dawn was red,"
12835,BOOK III.,"We sought the man, we marked him; and he prayed,--"
12836,BOOK III.,"Kneeling, he prayed in the valley, and he said--"""
12837,BOOK III.,"""Nay,"" quoth the serpent, ""spare me, what devout"

12846,BOOK III.,
12847,BOOK III.,"That when he heard,"

12854,BOOK III.,"Will be his loving Lord."""
12855,BOOK III.,
12856,BOOK III.,"The dragon cried,"
12857,BOOK III.,"""The last is worse than all. O, man, thy heart"
12858,BOOK III.,Is stout against His wrath. But will He love?
12859,BOOK III.,"I heard it rumored in the heavens of old,"
12860,BOOK III.,"(And doth He love?) Thou wilt not, canst not, stand"
12861,BOOK III.,Against the love of God. Dominion fails;
12862,BOOK III.,"I see it float from me, that long have worn"
12863,BOOK III.,Fetters of flesh to win it. Love of God!
12864,BOOK III.,"I cry against thee; thou art worse than all."""
12865,BOOK III.,"They answered, ""Be not moved, admired chief"
12866,BOOK III.,"And trusted of mankind""; and they went on,"
12867,BOOK III.,And fed him with the prophecies that fell
12868,BOOK III.,From the Master-shipwright in his prayer.
12869,BOOK III.,
12870,BOOK III.,But prone
12871,BOOK III.,"He lay, for he was sick: at every word"
12872,BOOK III.,"Prophetic cowering. As a bruising blow,"
12873,BOOK III.,"It fell upon his head and daunted him,"
12874,BOOK III.,"Until they ended, saying, ""Prince, behold,"
12875,BOOK III.,"Thy servants have revealed the whole."""
12876,BOOK III.,
12877,BOOK III.,Thereon
12878,BOOK III.,He out of snaky lips did hiss forth thanks.
12879,BOOK III.,"Then said he, ""Tartis and Deleisonon,"
12880,BOOK III.,"Receive your wages."" So their fetters fell;"
12881,BOOK III.,"And they retiring, lauded him, and cried,"
12882,BOOK III.,"""King, reign forever."" Then he mourned, ""Amen."""
12883,BOOK III.,
12884,BOOK III.,"And he,--being left alone,--he said: ""A light!"
12885,BOOK III.,"I see a light,--a star among the trees,--"
12886,BOOK III.,"An angel."" And it drew toward the cave,"
12887,BOOK III.,"But with its sacred feet touched not the grass,"
12888,BOOK III.,"Nor lifted up the lids of its pure eyes,"
12889,BOOK III.,"But hung a span's length from that ground pollute,"
12890,BOOK III.,At the opening of the cave.
12891,BOOK III.,
12892,BOOK III.,"And when he looked,"
12893,BOOK III.,"The dragon cried, ""Thou newly-fashioned thing,"
12894,BOOK III.,"Of name unknown, thy scorn becomes thee not."
12895,BOOK III.,Doth not thy Master suffer what thine eyes
12896,BOOK III.,"Thou countest all too clean to open on?"""
12897,BOOK III.,"But still it hovered, and the quietness"
12898,BOOK III.,Of holy heaven was on the drooping lids;
12899,BOOK III.,"And not as one that answereth, it let fall"
12900,BOOK III.,"The music from its mouth, but like to one"

12902,BOOK III.,
12903,BOOK III.,"""A message: 'I have heard thee, while remote"

12907,BOOK III.,I have made to serve the ends of My great love.
12908,BOOK III.,Hereafter will I chain thee down. To-day
12909,BOOK III.,One thing thou art forbidden; now thou knowest
12910,BOOK III.,"The name thereof: I told it thee in heaven,"
12911,BOOK III.,When thou wert sitting at My feet. Forbear
12912,BOOK III.,To let that hidden thing be whispered forth:
12913,BOOK III.,"For man, ungrateful (and thy hope it was,"
12914,BOOK III.,"That so ungrateful he might prove), would scorn,"
12915,BOOK III.,"And not believe it, adding so fresh weight"
12916,BOOK III.,Of condemnation to the doomed world.
12917,BOOK III.,"Concerning that, thou art forbid to speak;"
12918,BOOK III.,"Know thou didst count it, falling from My tongue,"
12919,BOOK III.,"A lovely song, whose meaning was unknown,"
12920,BOOK III.,"Unknowable, unbearable to thought,"
12921,BOOK III.,But sweeter in the hearing than all harps
12922,BOOK III.,Toned in My holy hollow. Now thine ears

12925,BOOK III.,
12926,BOOK III.,"So said, it turned, and with a cry of joy,"
12927,BOOK III.,"As one released, went up: and it was dawn,"
12928,BOOK III.,"And all boughs dropped with dew, and out of mist"
12929,BOOK III.,Came the red sun and looked into the cave.
12930,BOOK III.,
12931,BOOK III.,"But the dragon, left a-tremble, called to him,"
12932,BOOK III.,"From the nether kingdom, certain of his friends,--"
12933,BOOK III.,"Three whom he trusted, councillors accursed."
12934,BOOK III.,A thunder-cloud stooped low and swathed the place
12935,BOOK III.,"In its black swirls, and out of it they rushed,"
12936,BOOK III.,"And hid them in recesses of the cave,"
12937,BOOK III.,"Because they could not look upon the sun,"
12938,BOOK III.,"Sith light is pure. And Satan called to them,--"
12939,BOOK III.,"All in the dark, in his great rage he spake:"
12940,BOOK III.,"""Up,"" quoth the dragon; ""it is time to work,"
12941,BOOK III.,"Or we are all undone."" And he did hiss,"
12942,BOOK III.,"And there came shudderings over land and trees,"
12943,BOOK III.,A dimness after dawn. The earth threw out
12944,BOOK III.,"A blinding fog, that crept toward the cave,"
12945,BOOK III.,"And rolled up blank before it like a veil,--"
12946,BOOK III.,curtain to conceal its habiters.
12947,BOOK III.,"Then did those spirits move upon the floor,"
12948,BOOK III.,"Like pillars of darkness, and with eyes aglow."
12949,BOOK III.,One had a helm for covering of the scars
12950,BOOK III.,That seamed what rested of a goodly face;
12951,BOOK III.,"He wore his vizor up, and all his words"
12952,BOOK III.,Were hollower than an echo from the hills:
12953,BOOK III.,"He was hight Make. And, lo, his fellow-fiend"
12954,BOOK III.,"Came after, holding down his dastard head,"
12955,BOOK III.,Like one ashamed: now this for craft was great;
12956,BOOK III.,The dragon honored him. A third sat down
12957,BOOK III.,"Among them, covering with his wasted hand"
12958,BOOK III.,Somewhat that pained his breast.
12959,BOOK III.,
12960,BOOK III.,And when the fit
12961,BOOK III.,"Of thunder, and the sobbings of the wind,"
12962,BOOK III.,"Were lulled, the dragon spoke with wrath and rage,"
12963,BOOK III.,"And told them of his matters: ""Look to this,"
12964,BOOK III.,"If ye be loyal""; adding, ""Give your thoughts,"
12965,BOOK III.,"And let me have your counsel in this need."""
12966,BOOK III.,
12967,BOOK III.,"One spirit rose and spake, and all the cave"

12980,BOOK III.,"And while, a million strong, like rooks they rose,"
12981,BOOK III.,"He took and broke it, flung it here and there,"
12982,BOOK III.,And called a blast to drive the powder forth;
12983,BOOK III.,"And it was fine as dust, and blurred the skies"
12984,BOOK III.,Farther than 'tis from hence to this young sun.
12985,BOOK III.,"Spirits that passed upon their work that day,"
12986,BOOK III.,"Cried out, 'How dusty 'tis.' Behoves us, then,"
12987,BOOK III.,"That we depart, as leaving unto Him"
12988,BOOK III.,This goodly world and goodly race of man.
12989,BOOK III.,Not all are doomed; hereafter it may be

12991,BOOK III.,"Too zealous to preserve it, and the men"

13024,BOOK III.,"To whelm the world, and heave the floors o' the deep,"
13025,BOOK III.,Of purpose to pursue me from my place?

13148,BOOK IV.,And fixed on him their grave untroubled eyes;
13149,BOOK IV.,"He in his regal grandeur walked alone,"
13150,BOOK IV.,"And had nor steed nor follower, and his mien"
13151,BOOK IV.,"Was grave and like to theirs. He said to them,"
13152,BOOK IV.,"""Fair sirs, whose are ye?"" They made answer cold,"
13153,BOOK IV.,"""The beautiful woman, sir, our mother dear,"
13154,BOOK IV.,"Niloiya, bear us to great Lamech's son."""
13155,BOOK IV.,"And he, replying, ""I am he."" They said,"
13156,BOOK IV.,"""We know it, sir. We have remembered you"
13157,BOOK IV.,Through many seasons. Pray you let us not;
13158,BOOK IV.,"We fain would greet our mother."" And they made"
13159,BOOK IV.,"Obeisance and passed on; then all their train,"
13160,BOOK IV.,"Which while they spoke had halted, moved apace,"
13161,BOOK IV.,"And, while the silent father stood, went by,"
13162,BOOK IV.,"He gazing after, as a man that dreams;"
13163,BOOK IV.,"For he was sick with their cold, quiet scorn,"
13164,BOOK IV.,"That seemed to say, ""Father, we own you not."
13165,BOOK IV.,"We love you not, for you have left us long,--"
13166,BOOK IV.,"So long, we care not that you come again."""
13167,BOOK IV.,
13168,BOOK IV.,"And while the sullen camels moved, he spake"
13169,BOOK IV.,"To him that led the last, ""There are but two"
13170,BOOK IV.,Of these my sons; but where doth Japhet ride?
13171,BOOK IV.,"For I would see him."" And the leader said,"
13172,BOOK IV.,"""Sir, ye shall find him, if ye follow up"
13173,BOOK IV.,Along the track. Afore the noonday meal
13174,BOOK IV.,"The young men, even our masters, bathed; (there grows"
13175,BOOK IV.,A clump of cedars by the bend of yon
13176,BOOK IV.,"Clear river)--there did Japhet, after meat,"
13177,BOOK IV.,"Being right weary, lay him down and sleep."
13178,BOOK IV.,"There, with a company of slaves and some"
13179,BOOK IV.,"Few camels, ye shall find him."""
13180,BOOK IV.,
13181,BOOK IV.,And the man
13182,BOOK IV.,"The father of these three, did let him pass,"
13183,BOOK IV.,"And struggle and give battle to his heart,"
13184,BOOK IV.,Standing as motionless as pillar set
13185,BOOK IV.,To guide a wanderer in a pathless waste;
13186,BOOK IV.,"But all his strength went from him, and he strove"
13187,BOOK IV.,Vainly to trample out and trample down
13188,BOOK IV.,"The misery of his love unsatisfied,--"
13189,BOOK IV.,Unutterable love flung in his face.
13190,BOOK IV.,
13191,BOOK IV.,"Then he broke out in passionate words, that cried"
13192,BOOK IV.,"Against his lot, ""I have lost my own, and won"
13193,BOOK IV.,"None other; no, not one! Alas, my sons!"
13194,BOOK IV.,"That I have looked to for my solacing,"
13195,BOOK IV.,"In the bitterness to come. My children dear!"""
13196,BOOK IV.,"And when from his own lips he heard those words,"
13197,BOOK IV.,"With passionate stirring of the heart, he wept."
13198,BOOK IV.,
13199,BOOK IV.,And none came nigh to comfort him. His face
13200,BOOK IV.,"Was on the ground; but, having wept, he rose"
13201,BOOK IV.,"Full hastily, and urged his way to find"
13202,BOOK IV.,The river; and in hollow of his hand
13203,BOOK IV.,"Raised up the water to his brow: ""This son,"
13204,BOOK IV.,"This other son of mine,"" he said, ""shall see"
13205,BOOK IV.,"No tears upon my face."" And he looked on,"
13206,BOOK IV.,"Beheld the camels, and a group of slaves"
13207,BOOK IV.,"Sitting apart from some one fast asleep,"
13208,BOOK IV.,Where they had spread out webs of broidery work
13209,BOOK IV.,"Under a cedar-tree; and he came on,"
13210,BOOK IV.,And when they made obeisance he declared
13211,BOOK IV.,"His name, and said, ""I will beside my son"
13212,BOOK IV.,"Sit till he wakeneth."" So Japhet lay"
13213,BOOK IV.,"A-dreaming, and his father drew to him."
13214,BOOK IV.,"He said, ""This cannot scorn me yet""; and paused,"
13215,BOOK IV.,"Right angry with himself, because the youth,"
13216,BOOK IV.,"Albeit of stately growth, so languidly"
13217,BOOK IV.,"Lay with a listless smile upon his mouth,"
13218,BOOK IV.,"That was full sweet and pure; and as he looked,"
13219,BOOK IV.,He half forgot his trouble in his pride.
13220,BOOK IV.,"""And is this mine?"" said he, ""my son! mine own!"
13221,BOOK IV.,"(God, thou art good!) O, if this turn away,"
13222,BOOK IV.,That pang shall be past bearing. I must think
13223,BOOK IV.,That all the sweetness of his goodly face
13224,BOOK IV.,Is copied from his soul. How beautiful
13225,BOOK IV.,"Are children to their fathers! Son, my heart"
13226,BOOK IV.,Is greatly glad because of thee; my life
13227,BOOK IV.,Shall lack of no completeness in the days
13228,BOOK IV.,"To come. If I forget the joy of youth,"
13229,BOOK IV.,"In thee shall I be comforted; ay, see"
13230,BOOK IV.,"My youth, a dearer than my own again."""
13231,BOOK IV.,
13232,BOOK IV.,"And when he ceased, the youth, with sleep content,"
13233,BOOK IV.,"Murmured a little, turned himself and woke."
13234,BOOK IV.,
13235,BOOK IV.,"He woke, and opened on his father's face"
13236,BOOK IV.,The darkness of his eyes; but not a word
13237,BOOK IV.,"The Master-shipwright said,--his lips were sealed;"
13238,BOOK IV.,"He was not ready, for he feared to see"
13239,BOOK IV.,"This mouth curl up with scorn. And Japhet spoke,"
13240,BOOK IV.,Full of the calm that cometh after sleep:
13241,BOOK IV.,"""Sir, I have dreamed of you. I pray you, sir,"
13242,BOOK IV.,"What is your name?"" and even with his words"
13243,BOOK IV.,"His countenance changed. The son of Lamech said,"
13244,BOOK IV.,"""Why art thou sad? What have I done to thee?"""
13245,BOOK IV.,"And Japhet answered, ""O, methought I fled"
13246,BOOK IV.,"In the wilderness before a maddened beast,"
13247,BOOK IV.,And you came up and slew it; and I thought
13248,BOOK IV.,"You were my father; but I fear me, sir,"
13249,BOOK IV.,"My thoughts were vain."" With that his father said,"
13250,BOOK IV.,"""Whatever of blessing Thou reserv'st for me,"
13251,BOOK IV.,"God! if Thou wilt not give to both, give here:"
13252,BOOK IV.,"Bless him with both Thy hands""; and laid his own"
13253,BOOK IV.,On Japhet's head.
13254,BOOK IV.,"Then Japhet looked on him,"
13255,BOOK IV.,"Made quiet by content, and answered low,"
13256,BOOK IV.,"With faltering laughter, glad and reverent: ""Sir,"
13257,BOOK IV.,"You are my father?"" ""Ay,"" quoth he, ""I am!"
13258,BOOK IV.,"Kiss me, my son; and let me hear my name,"
13259,BOOK IV.,"My much desiréd name, from your dear lips."""
13260,BOOK IV.,
13261,BOOK IV.,"Then after, rested, they betook them home:"
13262,BOOK IV.,"And Japhet, walking by the Master, thought,"
13263,BOOK IV.,"""I did not will to love this sire of mine;"
13264,BOOK IV.,But now I feel as if I had always known
13265,BOOK IV.,"And loved him well; truly, I see not why,"
13266,BOOK IV.,But I would rather serve him than go free
13267,BOOK IV.,"With my two brethren."" And he said to him,"
13268,BOOK IV.,"""Father!""--who answered, ""I am here, my son."""
13269,BOOK IV.,"And Japhet said, ""I pray you, sir, attend"
13270,BOOK IV.,"To this my answer: let me go with you,"
13271,BOOK IV.,"For, now I think on it, I do not love"
13272,BOOK IV.,"The chase, nor managing the steed, nor yet"
13273,BOOK IV.,"The arrows and the bow; but rather you,"
13274,BOOK IV.,"For all you do and say, and you yourself,"
13275,BOOK IV.,Are goodly and delightsome in mine eyes.
13276,BOOK IV.,"I pray you, sir, when you go forth again,"
13277,BOOK IV.,"That I may also go."" And he replied,"
13278,BOOK IV.,"""I will tell thy speech unto the Highest; He"
13279,BOOK IV.,Shall answer it. But I would speak to thee
13280,BOOK IV.,"Now of the days to come. Know thou, most dear"
13281,BOOK IV.,"To this thy father, that the drenched world,"
13282,BOOK IV.,"When risen clean washed from water, shall receive"
13283,BOOK IV.,"From thee her lordliest governors, from thee"
13284,BOOK IV.,"Daughters of noblest soul."""
13285,BOOK IV.,"So Japhet said,"
13286,BOOK IV.,"""Sir, I am young, but of my mother straight"
13287,BOOK IV.,"I will go ask a wife, that this may be."
13288,BOOK IV.,"I pray you, therefore, as the manner is"
13289,BOOK IV.,"Of fathers, give me land that I may reap"
13290,BOOK IV.,"Corn for sustaining of my wife, and bruise"
13291,BOOK IV.,"The fruit of the vine to cheer her."" But he said,"
13292,BOOK IV.,"""Dost thou forget? or dost thou not believe,"
13293,BOOK IV.,"My son?"" He answered, ""I did ne'er believe,"
13294,BOOK IV.,"My father, ere to-day; but now, methinks,"
13295,BOOK IV.,"Whatever thou believest I believe,"
13296,BOOK IV.,For thy belovéd sake. If this then be
13297,BOOK IV.,"As thou (I hear) hast said, and earth doth bear"
13298,BOOK IV.,"The last of her wheat harvests, and make ripe"
13299,BOOK IV.,"The latest of her grapes; yet hear me, sir,"
13300,BOOK IV.,None of the daughters shall be given to me
13301,BOOK IV.,"If I be landless."" Then his father said,"
13302,BOOK IV.,"""Lift up thine eyes toward the north, my son"""
13303,BOOK IV.,"And so he did. ""Behold thy heritage!"""
13304,BOOK IV.,"Quoth the world's prince and master, ""far away"
13305,BOOK IV.,"Upon the side o' the north, where green the field"
13306,BOOK IV.,"Lies every season through, and where the dews"
13307,BOOK IV.,"Of heaven are wholesome, shall thy children reign;"
13308,BOOK IV.,"I part it to them, for the earth is mine;"
13309,BOOK IV.,The Highest gave it me: I make it theirs.
13310,BOOK IV.,"Moreover, for thy marriage gift, behold"
13311,BOOK IV.,The cedars where thou sleepedst! There are vines;
13312,BOOK IV.,And up the rise is growing wheat. I give
13313,BOOK IV.,"(For all, alas! is mine),--I give thee both"
13314,BOOK IV.,"For dowry, and my blessing."""
13315,BOOK IV.,"And he said,"
13316,BOOK IV.,"""Sir, you are good, and therefore the Most High"
13317,BOOK IV.,"Shall bless me also. Sir, I love you well."""
13318,BOOK IV.,
13319,BOOK IV.,
13320,BOOK V.,BOOK V.
13321,BOOK V.,
13322,BOOK V.,"And when two days were over, Japhet said,"
13323,BOOK V.,"""Mother, so please you, get a wife for me."""
13324,BOOK V.,"The mother answered, ""Dost thou mock me, son?"
13325,BOOK V.,'Tis not the manner of our kin to wed
13326,BOOK V.,So young. Thou knowest it; art thou not ashamed?
13327,BOOK V.,"Thou carest not for a wife."" And the youth blushed,"
13328,BOOK V.,"And made for answer: ""This, my father, saith"
13329,BOOK V.,"The doom is nigh; now therefore find a maid,"
13330,BOOK V.,Or else shall I be wifeless all my days.
13331,BOOK V.,"And as for me, I care not; but the lands"
13332,BOOK V.,"Are parted, and the goodliest share is mine."
13333,BOOK V.,And lo! my brethren are betrothed; their maids
13334,BOOK V.,Are with thee in the house. Then why not mine?
13335,BOOK V.,Didst thou not diligently search for these
13336,BOOK V.,"Among the noblest born of all the earth,"
13337,BOOK V.,"And bring them up? My sisters, dwell they not"
13338,BOOK V.,With women that bespake them for their sons?
13339,BOOK V.,"Now, therefore, let a wife be found for me,"
13340,BOOK V.,"Fair as the day, and gentle to my will"
13341,BOOK V.,"As thou art to my father's."" When she heard,"
13342,BOOK V.,"Niloiya sighed, and answered, ""It is well."""
13343,BOOK V.,And Japhet went out from her presence.
13344,BOOK V.,Then
13345,BOOK V.,"Quoth the great Master: ""Wherefore sought ye not,"
13346,BOOK V.,"Woman, these many days, nor tired at all,"
13347,BOOK V.,"Till ye had found, a maiden for my son?"
13348,BOOK V.,"In this ye have done ill."" Niloiya said:"
13349,BOOK V.,"""Let not my lord be angry. All my soul"
13350,BOOK V.,"Is sad: my lord hath walked afar so long,"
13351,BOOK V.,"That some despise thee; yea, our servants fail"
13352,BOOK V.,Lately to bring their stint of corn and wood.
13353,BOOK V.,"And, sir, thy household slaves do steal away"
13354,BOOK V.,"To thy great father, and our lands lie waste,--"
13355,BOOK V.,None till them: therefore think the women scorn
13356,BOOK V.,"To give me,--whatsoever gems I send,"
13357,BOOK V.,"And goodly raiment,--(yea, I seek afar,"
13358,BOOK V.,And sue with all desire and humbleness
13359,BOOK V.,"Through every master's house, but no one gives)--"
13360,BOOK V.,"A daughter for my son."" With that she ceased."
13361,BOOK V.,
13362,BOOK V.,"Then said the Master: ""Some thou hast with thee,"
13363,BOOK V.,"Brought up among thy children, dutiful"
13364,BOOK V.,"And fair; thy father gave them for my slaves,--"
13365,BOOK V.,Children of them whom he brought captive forth
13366,BOOK V.,"From their own heritage."" And she replied,"
13367,BOOK V.,"Right scornfully: ""Shall Japhet wed a slave?"""
13368,BOOK V.,"Then said the Master: ""He shall wed: look thou"
13369,BOOK V.,To that. I say not he shall wed a slave;
13370,BOOK V.,"But by the might of One that made him mine,"
13371,BOOK V.,I will not quit thee for my doomed way
13372,BOOK V.,"Until thou wilt betroth him. Therefore, haste,"
13373,BOOK V.,"Beautiful woman, loved of me and mine,"
13374,BOOK V.,"To bring a maiden, and to say, 'Behold"
13375,BOOK V.,"A wife for Japhet.'"" Then she answered, ""Sir,"
13376,BOOK V.,"It shall be done."""
13377,BOOK V.,And forth Niloiya sped.
13378,BOOK V.,"She gathered all her jewels,--all she held"
13379,BOOK V.,"Of costly or of rich,--and went and spake"
13380,BOOK V.,"With some few slaves that yet abode with her,"
13381,BOOK V.,"For daily they were fewer; and went forth,"
13382,BOOK V.,"With fair and flattering words, among her feres,"
13383,BOOK V.,And fain had wrought with them: and she had hope
13384,BOOK V.,"That made her sick, it was so faint; and then"
13385,BOOK V.,"She had fear, and after she had certainty,"
13386,BOOK V.,"For all did scorn her. ""Nay,"" they cried. ""O fool!"
13387,BOOK V.,"If this be so, and on a watery world"
13388,BOOK V.,"Ye think to rock, what matters if a wife"
13389,BOOK V.,"Be free or bond? There shall be none to rule,"
13390,BOOK V.,"If she have freedom: if she have it not,"
13391,BOOK V.,"None shall there be to serve."""
13392,BOOK V.,"And she alit,"
13393,BOOK V.,"The time being done, desponding at her door,"
13394,BOOK V.,"And went behind a screen, where should have wrought"
13395,BOOK V.,The daughters of the captives; but there wrought
13396,BOOK V.,"One only, and this rose from off the floor,"
13397,BOOK V.,"Where she the river rush full deftly wove,"
13398,BOOK V.,"And made obeisance. Then Niloiya said,"
13399,BOOK V.,"""Where are thy fellows?"" And the maid replied,"
13400,BOOK V.,"""Let not Niloiya, this my lady loved,"
13401,BOOK V.,"Be angry; they are fled since yesternight."""
13402,BOOK V.,"Then said Niloiya, ""Amarant, my slave,"
13403,BOOK V.,"When have I called thee by thy name before?"""
13404,BOOK V.,"She answered, ""Lady, never""; and she took"
13405,BOOK V.,And spread her broidered robe before her face.
13406,BOOK V.,"Niloiya spoke thus: ""I am come to woe,"
13407,BOOK V.,"And thou to honor."" Saying this, she wept"
13408,BOOK V.,Passionate tears; and all the damsel's soul
13409,BOOK V.,"Was full of yearning wonder, and her robe"
13410,BOOK V.,"Slipped from her hand, and her right innocent face"
13411,BOOK V.,Was seen betwixt her locks of tawny hair
13412,BOOK V.,"That dropped about her knees, and her two eyes,"
13413,BOOK V.,"Blue as the much-loved flower that rims the beck,"
13414,BOOK V.,Looked sweetly on Niloiya; but she knew
13415,BOOK V.,"No meaning in her words; and she drew nigh,"
13416,BOOK V.,"And kneeled and said, ""Will this my lady speak?"
13417,BOOK V.,"Her damsel is desirous of her words."""
13418,BOOK V.,"Then said Niloiya, ""I, thy mistress, sought"
13419,BOOK V.,"A wife for Japhet, and no wife is found."""
13420,BOOK V.,"And yet again she wept with grief of heart,"
13421,BOOK V.,"Saying, ""Ah me, miserable! I must give"
13422,BOOK V.,"A wife: the Master willeth it: a wife,"
13423,BOOK V.,Ah me! unto the high-born. He will scorn
13424,BOOK V.,His mother and reproach me. I must give--
13425,BOOK V.,"None else have I to give--a slave,--even thee."""
13426,BOOK V.,"This further spake Niloiya: ""I was good,--"
13427,BOOK V.,"Had rue on thee, a tender sucking child,"
13428,BOOK V.,When they did tear thee from thy mother's breast;
13429,BOOK V.,"I fed thee, gave thee shelter, and I taught"
13430,BOOK V.,Thy hands all cunning arts that women prize.
13431,BOOK V.,But out on me! my good is turned to ill.
13432,BOOK V.,"O, Japhet, well-beloved!"" And she rose up,"
13433,BOOK V.,"And did restrain herself, saying, ""Dost thou heed?"
13434,BOOK V.,"Behold, this thing shall be."" The damsel sighed,"
13435,BOOK V.,"""Lady, I do."" Then went Niloiya forth."
13436,BOOK V.,
13437,BOOK V.,"And Amarant murmured in her deep amaze,"
13438,BOOK V.,"""Shall Japhet's little children kiss my mouth?"
13439,BOOK V.,"And will he sometimes take them from my arms,"
13440,BOOK V.,And almost care for me for their sweet sake?
13441,BOOK V.,"I have not dared to think I loved him,--now"
13442,BOOK V.,"I know it well: but O, the bitterness"
13443,BOOK V.,"For him!"" And ending thus, the damsel rose,"
13444,BOOK V.,For Japhet entered. And she bowed herself
13445,BOOK V.,"Meekly and made obeisance, but her blood"
13446,BOOK V.,"Ran cold about her heart, for all his face"
13447,BOOK V.,Was colored with his passion.
13448,BOOK V.,Japhet spoke:
13449,BOOK V.,"He said, ""My father's slave""; and she replied,"
13450,BOOK V.,"Low drooping her fair head, ""My master's son."""
13451,BOOK V.,"And after that a silence fell on them,"
13452,BOOK V.,"With trembling at her heart, and rage at his."
13453,BOOK V.,"And Japhet, mastered of his passion, sat"
13454,BOOK V.,"And could not speak. O! cruel seemed his fate,--"
13455,BOOK V.,"So cruel her that told it, so unkind."
13456,BOOK V.,His breast was full of wounded love and wrath
13457,BOOK V.,Wrestling together; and his eyes flashed out
13458,BOOK V.,"Indignant lights, as all amazed he took"
13459,BOOK V.,"The insult home that she had offered him,"
13460,BOOK V.,Who should have held his honor dear.
13461,BOOK V.,"And, lo,"
13462,BOOK V.,"The misery choked him and he cried in pain,"
13463,BOOK V.,"""Go, get thee forth""; but she, all white and still,"
13464,BOOK V.,"Parted her lips to speak, and yet spake not,"
13465,BOOK V.,"Nor moved. And Japhet rose up passionate,"
13466,BOOK V.,With lifted arm as one about to strike;
13467,BOOK V.,"But she cried out and met him, and she held"
13468,BOOK V.,"With desperate might his hand, and prayed to him,"
13469,BOOK V.,"""Strike not, or else shall men from henceforth say,"
13470,BOOK V.,"'Japhet is like to us.'"" And he shook off"
13471,BOOK V.,"The damsel, and he said, ""I thank thee, slave;"
13472,BOOK V.,For never have I stricken yet or child
13473,BOOK V.,"Or woman. Not for thy sake am I glad,"
13474,BOOK V.,"Nay, but for mine. Get hence. Obey my words."""
13475,BOOK V.,"Then Japhet lifted up his voice, and wept."
13476,BOOK V.,
13477,BOOK V.,"And no more he restrained himself, but cried,"
13478,BOOK V.,"With heavings of the heart, ""O hateful day!"
13479,BOOK V.,O day that shuts the door upon delight.
13480,BOOK V.,"A slave! to wed a slave! O loathéd wife,"
13481,BOOK V.,"Hated of Japhet's soul."" And after, long,"
13482,BOOK V.,"With face between his hands, he sat, his thoughts"
13483,BOOK V.,"Sullen and sore; then scorned himself, and saying,"
13484,BOOK V.,"""I will not take her, I will die unwed,"
13485,BOOK V.,"It is but that""; lift up his eyes and saw"
13486,BOOK V.,"The slave, and she was sitting at his feet;"
13487,BOOK V.,"And he, so greatly wondering that she dared"
13488,BOOK V.,"The disobedience, looked her in the face"
13489,BOOK V.,"Less angry than afraid, for pale she was"
13490,BOOK V.,As lily yet unsmiled on by the sun;
13491,BOOK V.,"And he, his passion being spent, sighed out,"
13492,BOOK V.,"""Low am I fallen indeed. Hast thou no fear,"
13493,BOOK V.,"That thou dost flout me?"" but she gave to him"
13494,BOOK V.,"The sighing echo of his sigh, and mourned,"
13495,BOOK V.,"""No."""
13496,BOOK V.,"And he wondered, and he looked again,"
13497,BOOK V.,"For in her heart there was a new-born pang,"
13498,BOOK V.,"That cried; but she, as mothers with their young,"
13499,BOOK V.,"Suffered, yet loved it; and there shone a strange"
13500,BOOK V.,Grave sweetness in her blue unsullied eyes.
13501,BOOK V.,"And Japhet, leaning from the settle, thought,"
13502,BOOK V.,"""What is it? I will call her by her name,"
13503,BOOK V.,"To comfort her, for also she is naught"
13504,BOOK V.,"To blame; and since I will not her to wife,"
13505,BOOK V.,"She falls back from the freedom she had hoped."""
13506,BOOK V.,"Then he said ""Amarant""; and the damsel drew"

13510,BOOK V.,"With thee, but wretched for my mother's deed,"
13511,BOOK V.,"Because she shamed me."""
13512,BOOK V.,"And the maiden said,"
13513,BOOK V.,"""Doth not thy father love thee well, sweet sir?"""
13514,BOOK V.,"""Ay,"" quoth he, ""well."" She answered, ""Let the heart"
13515,BOOK V.,"Of Japhet, then, be merry. Go to him"
13516,BOOK V.,"And say, 'The damsel whom my mother chose,"
13517,BOOK V.,"Sits by her in the house; but as for me,"
13518,BOOK V.,"Sir, ere I take her, let me go with you"
13519,BOOK V.,"To that same outland country. Also, sir,"
13520,BOOK V.,My damsel hath not worked as yet the robe

13522,BOOK V.,He will not say thee nay. Herein for awhile
13523,BOOK V.,"Is respite, and thy mother far and near"
13524,BOOK V.,Will seek again: it may be she will find
13525,BOOK V.,"A fair, free maiden."""
13526,BOOK V.,"Japhet said, ""O maid,"
13527,BOOK V.,"Sweet are thy words; but what if I return,"
13528,BOOK V.,"And all again be as it is to-day?"""
13529,BOOK V.,"Then Amarant answered, ""Some have died in youth;"
13530,BOOK V.,"But yet, I think not, sir, that I shall die."
13531,BOOK V.,"Though ye shall find it even as I had died,--"
13532,BOOK V.,"Silent, for any words I might have said;"
13533,BOOK V.,"Empty, for any space I might have filled."
13534,BOOK V.,"Sir, I will steal away, and hide afar;"
13535,BOOK V.,"But if a wife be found, then will I bide"

13541,BOOK V.,"Then she started from his feet,"
13542,BOOK V.,"And, red with shame and anger, flashed on him"
13543,BOOK V.,The passion of her eyes; and put her hands
13544,BOOK V.,"With catching of the breath to her fair throat,"
13545,BOOK V.,"And stood in her defiance lost to fear,"
13546,BOOK V.,Like some fair hind in desperate danger turned
13547,BOOK V.,"And brought to bay, and wild in her despair."
13548,BOOK V.,"But shortly, ""I remember,"" quoth she, low,"
13549,BOOK V.,"With raining down of tears and broken sighs,"
13550,BOOK V.,"""That I am Japhet's slave; beseech you, sir,"

13554,BOOK V.,"That also ye might give me. Pray you, sir,"
13555,BOOK V.,"Be pitiful,--be merciful to me,"
13556,BOOK V.,"A slave."" He said, ""I thought to do thee good,"
13557,BOOK V.,"For good hath been thy counsel""; but she cried,"
13558,BOOK V.,"""Good master, be you therefore pitiful"
13559,BOOK V.,"To me, a slave."" And Japhet wondered much"
13560,BOOK V.,"At her, and at her beauty, for he thought,"
13561,BOOK V.,"""None of the daughters are so fair as this,"
13562,BOOK V.,Nor stand with such a grace majestical;
13563,BOOK V.,"She in her locks is like the travelling sun,"
13564,BOOK V.,"Setting, all clad in coifing clouds of gold."
13565,BOOK V.,"And would she die unmatched?"" He said to her,"
13566,BOOK V.,"""What! wilt thou sail alone in yonder ship,"
13567,BOOK V.,"And dwell alone hereafter?"" ""Ay,"" she said,"
13568,BOOK V.,"""And serve my mistress."""
13569,BOOK V.,"""It is well,"" quoth he,"
13570,BOOK V.,"And held his hand to her, as is the way"
13571,BOOK V.,"Of masters. Then she kissed it, and she said,"
13572,BOOK V.,"""Thanks for benevolence,"" and turned herself,"
13573,BOOK V.,"Adding, ""I rest, sir, on your gracious words"";"
13574,BOOK V.,Then stepped into the twilight and was gone.
13575,BOOK V.,
13576,BOOK V.,"And Japhet, having found his father, said,"
13577,BOOK V.,"""Sir, let me also journey when ye go."""
13578,BOOK V.,"Who answered, ""Hath thy mother done her part?"""
13579,BOOK V.,
13580,BOOK V.,"He said, ""Yea, truly, and my damsel sits"
13581,BOOK V.,"Before her in the house; and also, sir,"
13582,BOOK V.,"She said to me, 'I have not worked, as yet,"
13583,BOOK V.,"The garment of betrothal.'"" And he said,"
13584,BOOK V.,"""'Tis not the manner of our kin to speak"
13585,BOOK V.,Concerning matters that a woman rules;
13586,BOOK V.,"But hath thy mother brought a damsel home,"
13587,BOOK V.,"And let her see thy face, then all is one"
13588,BOOK V.,"As ye were wed."" He answered, ""Even so,"
13589,BOOK V.,"It matters nothing; therefore hear me, sir:"
13590,BOOK V.,"The damsel being mine, I am content"
13591,BOOK V.,To let her do according to her will;
13592,BOOK V.,"And when we shall return, so surely, sir,"
13593,BOOK V.,"As I shall find her by my mother's side,"
13594,BOOK V.,"Then will I take her""; and he left to speak;"

13600,BOOK VI.,"Night. Now a tent was pitched, and Japhet sat"
13601,BOOK VI.,"In the door and watched, for on a litter lay"
13602,BOOK VI.,The father of his love. And he was sick
13603,BOOK VI.,"To death; but daily he would rouse him up,"
13604,BOOK VI.,"And stare upon the light, and ever say,"
13605,BOOK VI.,"""On, let us journey""; but it came to pass"
13606,BOOK VI.,"That night, across their path a river ran,"
13607,BOOK VI.,And they who served the father and the son
13608,BOOK VI.,"Had pitched the tents beside it, and had made"
13609,BOOK VI.,"A fire, to scare away the savagery"
13610,BOOK VI.,"That roamed in that great forest, for their way"
13611,BOOK VI.,Had led among the trees of God.
13612,BOOK VI.,The moon
13613,BOOK VI.,"Shone on the river, like a silver road"
13614,BOOK VI.,"To lead them over; but when Japhet looked,"
13615,BOOK VI.,"He said, ""We shall not cross it. I shall lay"
13616,BOOK VI.,"This well-belovéd head low in the leaves,--"
13617,BOOK VI.,"Not on the farther side."" From time to time,"
13618,BOOK VI.,The water-snakes would stir its glassy flow
13619,BOOK VI.,"With curling undulations, and would lay"
13620,BOOK VI.,"Their heads along the bank, and, subtle-eyed,"
13621,BOOK VI.,"Consider those long spirting flames, that danced,"
13622,BOOK VI.,When some red log would break and crumble down;
13623,BOOK VI.,"And show his dark despondent eyes, that watched,"
13624,BOOK VI.,"Wearily, even Japhet's. But he cared"
13625,BOOK VI.,"Little; and in the dark, that was not dark,"
13626,BOOK VI.,"But dimness of confused incertitude,"
13627,BOOK VI.,"Would move a-near all silently, and gaze"
13628,BOOK VI.,"And breathe, and shape itself, a manéd thing"
13629,BOOK VI.,"With eyes; and still he cared not, and the form"
13630,BOOK VI.,"Would falter, then recede, and melt again"
13631,BOOK VI.,Into the farther shade. And Japhet said:
13632,BOOK VI.,"""How long? The moon hath grown again in heaven,"
13633,BOOK VI.,"After her caving twice, since we did leave"
13634,BOOK VI.,The threshold of our home; and now what 'vails
13635,BOOK VI.,"That far on tumbled mountain snow we toiled,"
13636,BOOK VI.,"Hungry, and weary, all the day; by night"
13637,BOOK VI.,"Waked with a dreadful trembling underneath,"
13638,BOOK VI.,"To look, while every cone smoked, and there ran"
13639,BOOK VI.,"Red brooks adown, that licked the forest up,"
13640,BOOK VI.,While in the pale white ashes wading on
13641,BOOK VI.,"We saw no stars?--what 'vails if afterward,"
13642,BOOK VI.,"Astonished with great silence, we did move"
13643,BOOK VI.,"Over the measureless, unknown desert mead;"
13644,BOOK VI.,"While all the day, in rents and crevices,"
13645,BOOK VI.,"Would lie the lizard and the serpent kind,"
13646,BOOK VI.,"Drowsy; and in the night take fearsome shapes,"
13647,BOOK VI.,And oft-times woman-faced and woman-haired
13648,BOOK VI.,"Would trail their snaky length, and curse and mourn;"
13649,BOOK VI.,"Or there would wander up, when we were tired,"
13650,BOOK VI.,"Dark troops of evil ones, with eyes morose,"
13651,BOOK VI.,"Withstanding us, and staring;--O! what 'vails"
13652,BOOK VI.,That in the dread deep forest we have fought
13653,BOOK VI.,"With following packs of wolves? These men of might,"
13654,BOOK VI.,"Even the giants, shall not hear the doom"
13655,BOOK VI.,"My father came to tell them of. Ah, me!"
13656,BOOK VI.,"If God indeed had sent him, would he lie"
13657,BOOK VI.,(For he is stricken with a sore disease)
13658,BOOK VI.,"Helpless outside their city?"""
13659,BOOK VI.,"Then he rose,"
13660,BOOK VI.,"And put aside the curtains of the tent,"
13661,BOOK VI.,To look upon his father's face; and lo!
13662,BOOK VI.,"The tent being dark, he thought that somewhat sat"
13663,BOOK VI.,Beside the litter; and he set his eyes
13664,BOOK VI.,"To see it, and saw not; but only marked"
13665,BOOK VI.,"Where, fallen away from manhood and from power,"
13666,BOOK VI.,"His father lay. Then he came forth again,"
13667,BOOK VI.,"Trembling, and crouched beside the dull red fire,"
13668,BOOK VI.,"And murmured, ""Now it is the second time:"
13669,BOOK VI.,"An old man, as I think (but scarcely saw)."
13670,BOOK VI.,Dreadful of might. Its hair was white as wool:
13671,BOOK VI.,"I dared not look; perhaps I saw not aught,"
13672,BOOK VI.,But only knew that it was there: the same
13673,BOOK VI.,"Which walked beside us once when he did pray."""
13674,BOOK VI.,And Japhet hid his face between his hands
13675,BOOK VI.,"For fear, and grief of heart, and weariness"
13676,BOOK VI.,"Of watching; and he slumbered not, but mourned"
13677,BOOK VI.,"To himself, a little moment, as it seemed,"
13678,BOOK VI.,For sake of his loved father: then he lift
13679,BOOK VI.,"His eyes, and day had dawned. Right suddenly"
13680,BOOK VI.,"The moon withheld her silver, and she hung"
13681,BOOK VI.,"Frail as a cloud. The ruddy flame that played,"
13682,BOOK VI.,"By night on dim, dusk trees, and on the flood,"
13683,BOOK VI.,"Crept red amongst the logs, and all the world"
13684,BOOK VI.,And all the water blushed and bloomed. The stars
13685,BOOK VI.,"Were gone, and golden shafts came up, and touched"
13686,BOOK VI.,"The feathered heads of palms, and green was born"
13687,BOOK VI.,"Under the rosy cloud, and purples flew"
13688,BOOK VI.,"Like veils across the mountains; and he saw,"
13689,BOOK VI.,"Winding athwart them, bathed in blissful peace,"
13690,BOOK VI.,"And the sacredness of morn, the battlements"
13691,BOOK VI.,And out-posts of the giants; and there ran
13692,BOOK VI.,"On the other side the river, as it were,"
13693,BOOK VI.,"White mounds of marble, tabernacles fair,"
13694,BOOK VI.,And towers below a line of inland cliff:
13695,BOOK VI.,"These were their fastnesses, and here their homes."
13696,BOOK VI.,
13697,BOOK VI.,"In valleys and the forest, all that night,"
13698,BOOK VI.,"There had been woe; in every hollow place,"
13699,BOOK VI.,"And under walls, like drifted flowers, or snow,"
13700,BOOK VI.,Women lay mourning; for the serpent lodged
13701,BOOK VI.,"That night within the gates, and had decreed,"
13702,BOOK VI.,"""I will (or ever I come) that ye drive out"
13703,BOOK VI.,"The women, the abhorred of my soul."""
13704,BOOK VI.,"Therefore, more beauteous than all climbing bloom,"
13705,BOOK VI.,"Purple and scarlet, cumbering of the boughs,"
13706,BOOK VI.,Or flights of azure doves that lit to drink
13707,BOOK VI.,"The water of the river; or, new born,"
13708,BOOK VI.,"The quivering butterflies in companies,"
13709,BOOK VI.,"That slowly crept adown the sandy marge,"
13710,BOOK VI.,"Like living crocus beds, and also drank,"
13711,BOOK VI.,And rose an orange cloud; their hollowed hands
13712,BOOK VI.,"They dipped between the lilies, or with robes"
13713,BOOK VI.,"Full of ripe fruitage, sat and peeled and ate,"
13714,BOOK VI.,"Weeping; or comforting their little ones,"
13715,BOOK VI.,And lulling them with sorrowful long hymns
13716,BOOK VI.,Among the palms.
13717,BOOK VI.,So went the earlier morn.
13718,BOOK VI.,"Then came a messenger, while Japhet sat"
13719,BOOK VI.,"Mournfully, and he said, ""The men of might"
13720,BOOK VI.,"Are willing; let thy master, youth, appear."""
13721,BOOK VI.,"And Japhet said, ""So be it""; and he thought,"
13722,BOOK VI.,"""Now will I trust in God""; and he went in"
13723,BOOK VI.,"And stood before his father, and he said,"
13724,BOOK VI.,"""My father""; but the Master answered not,"
13725,BOOK VI.,"But gazed upon the curtains of his tent,"
13726,BOOK VI.,Nor knew that one had called him. He was clad
13727,BOOK VI.,"As ready for the journey, and his feet"
13728,BOOK VI.,"Were sandalled, and his staff was at his side;"
13729,BOOK VI.,And Japhet took the gown of sacrifice
13730,BOOK VI.,"And spread it on him, and he laid his crown"
13731,BOOK VI.,"Upon his knees, and he went forth, and lift"
13732,BOOK VI.,"His hand to heaven, and cried, ""My father's God!"""
13733,BOOK VI.,But neither whisper came nor echo fell
13734,BOOK VI.,When he did listen. Therefore he went on:
13735,BOOK VI.,"""Behold, I have a thing to say to thee."
13736,BOOK VI.,"My father charged thy servant, 'Let not ruth"
13737,BOOK VI.,"Prevail with thee, to turn and bear me hence,"
13738,BOOK VI.,"For God appointed me my task, to preach"
13739,BOOK VI.,Before the mighty.' I must do my part
13740,BOOK VI.,"(O! let it not displease thee), for he said"
13741,BOOK VI.,"But yesternight, 'When they shall send for me,"
13742,BOOK VI.,Take me before them.' And I sware to him.
13743,BOOK VI.,"I pray thee, therefore, count his life and mine"
13744,BOOK VI.,"Precious; for I that sware, I will perform."""
13745,BOOK VI.,
13746,BOOK VI.,"Then cried he to his people, ""Let us hence:"
13747,BOOK VI.,"Take up the litter."" And they set their feet"
13748,BOOK VI.,Toward the raft whereby men crossed that flood.
13749,BOOK VI.,"And while they journeyed, lo, the giants sat"
13750,BOOK VI.,"Within the fairest hall where all were fair,"
13751,BOOK VI.,"Each on his carven throne, o'er-canopied"
13752,BOOK VI.,With work of women. And the dragon lay
13753,BOOK VI.,In a place of honor; and with subtlety
13754,BOOK VI.,"He counselled them, for they did speak by turns;"
13755,BOOK VI.,"And they being proud, might nothing master them,"
13756,BOOK VI.,But guile alone: and he did fawn on them;
13757,BOOK VI.,"And when the younger taunted him, submiss"
13758,BOOK VI.,"He testified great humbleness, and cried,"
13759,BOOK VI.,"""A cruel God, forsooth! but nay, O nay,"
13760,BOOK VI.,"I will not think it of Him, that He meant"
13761,BOOK VI.,"To threaten these. O, when I look on them,"
13762,BOOK VI.,"How doth my soul admire."""
13763,BOOK VI.,
13764,BOOK VI.,"And one stood forth,"
13765,BOOK VI.,"The youngest; of his brethren, named ""the Rock."""
13766,BOOK VI.,"""Speak out,"" quoth he, ""thou toothless slavering thing,"
13767,BOOK VI.,What is it? thinkest thou that such as we
13768,BOOK VI.,"Should be afraid? What is this goodly doom?"""
13769,BOOK VI.,"And Satan laughed upon him. ""Lo,"" said he,"
13770,BOOK VI.,"""Thou art not fully grown, and every one"
13771,BOOK VI.,"I look on, standeth higher by the head,"
13772,BOOK VI.,"Yea, and the shoulders, than do other men;"
13773,BOOK VI.,"Forsooth, thy servant thought not thou wouldst fear,"
13774,BOOK VI.,"Thou and thy fellows."" Then with one accord,"
13775,BOOK VI.,"""Speak,"" cried they; and with mild persuasive eyes,"
13776,BOOK VI.,"And flattering tongue, he spoke."
13777,BOOK VI.,
13778,BOOK VI.,"""Ye mighty ones,"
13779,BOOK VI.,It hath been known to you these many days

13781,BOOK VI.,"I am exceeding pious: if I lie,"
13782,BOOK VI.,"As hath been whispered, it is but for sake"
13783,BOOK VI.,"Of God, and that ye should not think Him hard,"
13784,BOOK VI.,For I am all for God. Now some have thought
13785,BOOK VI.,"that He hath also (and it, may be so"
13786,BOOK VI.,Or yet may not be so) on me been hard;
13787,BOOK VI.,"Be not ye therefore wroth, for my poor sake;"
13788,BOOK VI.,"I am contented to have earned your weal,"

13819,BOOK VI.,What! hast thou lied to this great company?

13822,BOOK VI.,
13823,BOOK VI.,"""Yea, majesties,"" quoth Satan, ""thus it was,"""

13881,BOOK VII.,And while he spoke there was a noise without;
13882,BOOK VII.,"The curtains of the door were flung aside,"
13883,BOOK VII.,"And some with heavy feet bare in, and set"
13884,BOOK VII.,A litter on the floor.
13885,BOOK VII.,The Master lay
13886,BOOK VII.,"Upon it, but his eyes were dimmed and set;"
13887,BOOK VII.,"And Japhet, in despairing weariness,"
13888,BOOK VII.,"Leaned it beside. He marked the mighty ones,"
13889,BOOK VII.,"Silent for pride of heart, and in his place"
13890,BOOK VII.,"The jewelled dragon; and the dragon laughed,"
13891,BOOK VII.,"And subtly peered at him, till Japhet shook"
13892,BOOK VII.,"With rage and fear. The snaky wonder cried,"
13893,BOOK VII.,"Hissing, ""Thou brown-haired youth, come up to me;"
13894,BOOK VII.,"I fain would have thee for my shrine afar,"
13895,BOOK VII.,To serve among an host as beautiful
13896,BOOK VII.,"As thou: draw near."" It hissed, and Japhet felt"
13897,BOOK VII.,"Horrible drawings, and cried out in fear,"
13898,BOOK VII.,"""Father! O help, the serpent draweth me!"""
13899,BOOK VII.,"And struggled and grew faint, as in the toils"
13900,BOOK VII.,A netted bird. But still his father lay
13901,BOOK VII.,"Unconscious, and the mighty did not speak,"
13902,BOOK VII.,But half in fear and half for wonderment
13903,BOOK VII.,"Beheld. And yet again the dragon laughed,"
13904,BOOK VII.,And leered at him and hissed; and Japhet strove
13905,BOOK VII.,"Vainly to take away his spell-set eyes,"
13906,BOOK VII.,"And moved to go to him, till piercingly"
13907,BOOK VII.,"Crying out, ""God! forbid it, God in heaven!"""
13908,BOOK VII.,"The dragon lowered his head, and shut his eyes"
13909,BOOK VII.,"As feigning sleep; and, suddenly released,"
13910,BOOK VII.,"He fell back staggering; and at noise of it,"
13911,BOOK VII.,"And clash of Japhet's weapons on the floor,"
13912,BOOK VII.,"And Japhet's voice crying out, ""I loathe thee, snake!"
13913,BOOK VII.,"I hate thee! O, I hate thee!"" came again,"
13914,BOOK VII.,"The senses of the shipwright; and he, moved,"
13915,BOOK VII.,"And looking, as one 'mazed, distressfully"
13916,BOOK VII.,"Upon the mighty, said, ""One called on God:"

13920,BOOK VII.,
13921,BOOK VII.,"It came to pass,"
13922,BOOK VII.,"While he was speaking, that the curtains swayed;"
13923,BOOK VII.,"A rushing wind did move throughout the place,"
13924,BOOK VII.,"And all the pillars shook, and on the head"
13925,BOOK VII.,"Of Noah the hair was lifted, and there played"
13926,BOOK VII.,"A somewhat, as it were a light, upon"
13927,BOOK VII.,"His breast; then fell a darkness, and men heard"
13928,BOOK VII.,"A whisper as of one that spake. With that,"
13929,BOOK VII.,The daunted mighty ones kept silent watch
13930,BOOK VII.,Until the wind had ceased and darkness fled.
13931,BOOK VII.,"When it grew light, there curled a cloud of smoke"
13932,BOOK VII.,From many censers where the dragon lay.
13933,BOOK VII.,"It hid him. He had called his ministrants,"
13934,BOOK VII.,"And bid them veil him thus, that none might look;"
13935,BOOK VII.,Also the folk who came with Noah had fled.
13936,BOOK VII.,
13937,BOOK VII.,"But Noah was seen, for he stood up erect,"
13938,BOOK VII.,"And leaned on Japhet's hand. Then, after pause,"
13939,BOOK VII.,"The Leader said, ""My brethren, it were well"

14042,BOOK VII.,"Then one to Japhet said,"

14056,BOOK VII.,"They answered, ""No, thou dost not think it, no!"""
14057,BOOK VII.,"And Japhet, being chafed, replied in heat,"
14058,BOOK VII.,"""And wherefore? if ye say of what is sworn,"

14070,BOOK VII.,With that they also passed.

14086,BOOK VII.,And from his daïs the feigning serpent hissed:
14087,BOOK VII.,"""Preacher, the light within, it was that shined,"
14088,BOOK VII.,And told him so. The pious will have dread

14097,BOOK VII.,"Yea, I have set myself 'twixt God and man,"
14098,BOOK VII.,"To be interpreter, and teach mankind"

14101,BOOK VII.,"It were beneath Him."""
14102,BOOK VII.,"And the Master said,"
14103,BOOK VII.,"""Thou liest. Thou wouldst lie away the world,"

14105,BOOK VII.,"Would suffer it."" ""I may not chide with thee,"""
14106,BOOK VII.,"It answered, ""NOW; but if there come such time"

14246,BOOK VIII.,"They seated proudly on their ivory thrones,"
14247,BOOK VIII.,"And scorning him: and of their peakéd hoods,"
14248,BOOK VIII.,"And garments wrought upon, each with the tale"

14250,BOOK VIII.,"(Yea, and about their skirts were effigies"
14251,BOOK VIII.,"Of kings that they had slain; and some, whose swords"
14252,BOOK VIII.,"Many had pierced, wore vestures all of red,"

14254,BOOK VIII.,"He told, but of the vision in the tent"
14255,BOOK VIII.,He told him not.
14256,BOOK VIII.,"And when they reached the house,"
14257,BOOK VIII.,"Niloiya met them, and to Japhet cried,"
14258,BOOK VIII.,"""All hail, right fortunate! Lo, I have found"
14259,BOOK VIII.,A maid. And now thou hast done well to reap
14260,BOOK VIII.,"The late ripe corn."" So he went in with her,"
14261,BOOK VIII.,And she did talk with him right motherly:
14262,BOOK VIII.,"""It hath been fully told me how ye loathed"
14263,BOOK VIII.,"To wed thy father's slave; yea, she herself,"
14264,BOOK VIII.,"Did she not all declare to me?"""
14265,BOOK VIII.,"He said,"
14266,BOOK VIII.,"""Yet is thy damsel fair, and wise of heart."""
14267,BOOK VIII.,"""Yea,"" quoth his mother; ""she made clear to me"
14268,BOOK VIII.,"How ye did weep, my son, and ye did vow,"
14269,BOOK VIII.,'I will not take her!' Now it was not I
14270,BOOK VIII.,"That wrought to have it so."" And he replied,"
14271,BOOK VIII.,"""I know it."" Quoth the mother, ""It is well;"
14272,BOOK VIII.,"For that same cause is laughter in my heart."""
14273,BOOK VIII.,"""But she is sweet of language,"" Japhet said."
14274,BOOK VIII.,"""Ay,"" quoth Niloiya, ""and thy wife no less"
14275,BOOK VIII.,"Whom thou shalt wed anon,--forsooth, anon,--"
14276,BOOK VIII.,"It is a lucky hour. Thou wilt?"" He said,"
14277,BOOK VIII.,"""I will."" And Japhet laid the slender sheaf"
14278,BOOK VIII.,"From off his shoulder, and he said, ""Behold,"
14279,BOOK VIII.,"My father!"" Then Niloiya turned herself,"
14280,BOOK VIII.,"And lo! the shipwright stood. ""All hail!"" quoth she."
14281,BOOK VIII.,"And bowed herself, and kissed him on the mouth;"
14282,BOOK VIII.,"But while she spake with him, sorely he sighed;"
14283,BOOK VIII.,And she did hang about his neck the robe
14284,BOOK VIII.,"Of feasting, and she poured upon his hands"
14285,BOOK VIII.,"Clear water, and anointed him, and set"
14286,BOOK VIII.,Before him bread.
14287,BOOK VIII.,"And Japhet said to him,"
14288,BOOK VIII.,"""My father, my belovéd, wilt thou yet"
14289,BOOK VIII.,Be sad because of scorning? Eat this day;
14290,BOOK VIII.,For as an angel in their eyes thou art
14291,BOOK VIII.,"Who stand before thee."" But he answered, ""Peace!"
14292,BOOK VIII.,"Thy words are wide."""
14293,BOOK VIII.,"And when Niloiya heard,"
14294,BOOK VIII.,"She said, ""Is this a time for mirth of heart"
14295,BOOK VIII.,"And wine? Behold, I thought to wed my son,"
14296,BOOK VIII.,"Even this Japhet; but is this a time,"
14297,BOOK VIII.,"When sad is he to whom is my desire,"
14298,BOOK VIII.,"And lying under sorrow as from God?"""
14299,BOOK VIII.,
14300,BOOK VIII.,"He answered, ""Yea, it is a time of times;"
14301,BOOK VIII.,"Bring in the maid."" Niloiya said, ""The maid"
14302,BOOK VIII.,"That first I spoke on, shall not Japhet wed;"
14303,BOOK VIII.,"It likes not her, nor yet it likes not me."
14304,BOOK VIII.,"But I have found another; yea, good sooth,"
14305,BOOK VIII.,"The damsel will not tarry, she will come"
14306,BOOK VIII.,"With all her slaves by sundown."""
14307,BOOK VIII.,"And she said,"
14308,BOOK VIII.,"""Comfort thy heart, and eat: moreover, know"
14309,BOOK VIII.,How that thy great work even to-day is done.
14310,BOOK VIII.,"Sir, thy great ship is finished, and the folk"
14311,BOOK VIII.,"(For I, according to thy will, have paid"
14312,BOOK VIII.,"All that was left us to them for their wage,)"
14313,BOOK VIII.,"Have brought, as to a storehouse, flour of wheat,"
14314,BOOK VIII.,"Honey and oil,--much victual; yea, and fruits,"
14315,BOOK VIII.,"Curtains and household gear. And, sir, they say"
14316,BOOK VIII.,It is thy will to take it for thy hold

14318,BOOK VIII.,"Else wherefore was it built?"" She said, ""Good sir,"
14319,BOOK VIII.,I pray you make us not the whole earth's scorn.
14320,BOOK VIII.,"And now, to-morrow in thy father's house"
14321,BOOK VIII.,"Is a great feast, and weddings are toward;"
14322,BOOK VIII.,"Let be the ship, till after, for thy words"

14324,BOOK VIII.,There will I dwell'; I pray you therefore wait
14325,BOOK VIII.,"At least till He DOTH send it."""
14326,BOOK VIII.,"And he turned,"
14327,BOOK VIII.,And answered nothing. Now the sun was low
14328,BOOK VIII.,While yet she spake; and Japhet came to them
14329,BOOK VIII.,"In goodly raiment, and upon his arm"
14330,BOOK VIII.,The garment of betrothal. And with that
14331,BOOK VIII.,"A noise, and then brake in a woman slave"
14332,BOOK VIII.,"And Amarant. This, with folding of her hands,"
14333,BOOK VIII.,"Did say full meekly, ""If I do offend,"
14334,BOOK VIII.,Yet have not I been willing to offend;
14335,BOOK VIII.,For now this woman will not be denied
14336,BOOK VIII.,"Herself to tell her errand."""
14337,BOOK VIII.,And they sat.
14338,BOOK VIII.,"Then spoke the woman, ""If I do offend,"
14339,BOOK VIII.,"Pray you forgive the bondslave, for her tongue"
14340,BOOK VIII.,"Is for her mistress. 'Lo!' my mistress saith,"
14341,BOOK VIII.,"'Put off thy bravery, bridegroom; fold away,"
14342,BOOK VIII.,"Mother, thy webs of pride, thy costly robes"
14343,BOOK VIII.,Woven of many colors. We have heard
14344,BOOK VIII.,"Thy master. Lo, to-day right evil things"
14345,BOOK VIII.,"He prophesied to us, that were his friends;"
14346,BOOK VIII.,"Therefore, my answer:--God do so to me;"
14347,BOOK VIII.,"Yea, God do so to me, more also, more"
14348,BOOK VIII.,"Than He did threaten, if my damsel's foot"
14349,BOOK VIII.,"Ever draw nigh thy door.'"""
14350,BOOK VIII.,"And when she heard,"
14351,BOOK VIII.,"Niloiya sat amazed, in grief of soul."
14352,BOOK VIII.,"But Japhet came unto the slave, where low"
14353,BOOK VIII.,"She bowed herself for fear. He said, ""Depart;"
14354,BOOK VIII.,"Say to thy mistress, 'It is well.'"" With that"
14355,BOOK VIII.,"She turned herself, and she made haste to flee,"
14356,BOOK VIII.,"Lest any, for those evil words she brought,"
14357,BOOK VIII.,Would smite her. But the bondmaid of the house
14358,BOOK VIII.,"Lift up her hand and said, ""If I offend,"
14359,BOOK VIII.,It was not of my heart: thy damsel knew
14360,BOOK VIII.,"Naught of this matter."" And he held to her"
14361,BOOK VIII.,"His hand and touched her, and said, ""Amarant!"""
14362,BOOK VIII.,"And when she looked upon him, she did take"
14363,BOOK VIII.,"And spread before her face her radiant locks,"
14364,BOOK VIII.,"Trembling. And Japhet said, ""Lift up thy face,"
14365,BOOK VIII.,"O fairest of the daughters, thy fair face;"
14366,BOOK VIII.,"For, lo! the bridegroom standeth with the robe"
14367,BOOK VIII.,"Of thy betrothal! ""--and he took her locks"
14368,BOOK VIII.,"In his two hands to part them from her brow,"
14369,BOOK VIII.,"And laid them on her shoulders; and he said,"
14370,BOOK VIII.,"""Sweet are the blushes of thy face,"" and put"
14371,BOOK VIII.,"The robe upon her, having said, ""Behold,"
14372,BOOK VIII.,"I have repented me; and oft by night,"
14373,BOOK VIII.,"In the waste wilderness, while all things slept,"
14374,BOOK VIII.,"I thought upon thy words, for they were sweet."
14375,BOOK VIII.,
14376,BOOK VIII.,"""For this I make thee free. And now thyself"
14377,BOOK VIII.,"Art loveliest in mine eyes; I look, and lo!"
14378,BOOK VIII.,Thou art of beauty more than any thought
14379,BOOK VIII.,"I had concerning thee. Let, then, this robe,"
14380,BOOK VIII.,"Wrought on with imagery of fruitful bough,"
14381,BOOK VIII.,"And graceful leaf, and birds with tender eyes,"
14382,BOOK VIII.,"Cover the ripples of thy tawny hair."""
14383,BOOK VIII.,"So when she held her peace, he brought her nigh"
14384,BOOK VIII.,"To hear the speech of wedlock; ay, he took"
14385,BOOK VIII.,"The golden cup of wine to drink with her,"
14386,BOOK VIII.,"And laid the sheaf upon her arms. He said,"
14387,BOOK VIII.,"""Like as my fathers in the older days"
14388,BOOK VIII.,"Led home the daughters whom they chose, do I;"
14389,BOOK VIII.,"Like as they said, 'Mine honor have I set"

14391,BOOK VIII.,"Rule in my house, be mistress of my slaves,"
14392,BOOK VIII.,"And mother of my children."""
14393,BOOK VIII.,And he brought
14394,BOOK VIII.,"The damsel to his father, saying, ""Behold"
14395,BOOK VIII.,My wife! I have betrothed her to myself;
14396,BOOK VIII.,"I pray you, kiss her."" And the Master did:"
14397,BOOK VIII.,"He said, ""Be mother of a multitude,"
14398,BOOK VIII.,And let them to their father even so
14399,BOOK VIII.,"Be found, as he is found to me."""
14400,BOOK VIII.,With that
14401,BOOK VIII.,"She answered, ""Let this woman, sir, find grace"
14402,BOOK VIII.,"And favor in your sight."""
14403,BOOK VIII.,"And Japhet said,"
14404,BOOK VIII.,"""Sweet mother, I have wed the maid ye chose"
