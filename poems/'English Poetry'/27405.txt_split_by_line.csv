30,ULF VAN YERN,
31,ULF VAN YERN,
32,ULF VAN YERN,It was youthful Ulf Van Yern
33,ULF VAN YERN,Goes before the King to stand:
34,ULF VAN YERN,"""To avenge my father's death"
35,ULF VAN YERN,"Lend me warriors of thy band."""
36,ULF VAN YERN,
37,ULF VAN YERN,"""Of my kemps I'll lend thee them"
38,ULF VAN YERN,Who to follow thee consent;
39,ULF VAN YERN,Ask'st thou Vidrik Verlandson
40,ULF VAN YERN,Thou wilt further thy intent.
41,ULF VAN YERN,
42,ULF VAN YERN,"""I will lend thee of my men,"
43,ULF VAN YERN,Thou shalt have the very flower;
44,ULF VAN YERN,"Vidrik, and stark Diderik,"
45,ULF VAN YERN,Many kemps have felt their power.
46,ULF VAN YERN,
47,ULF VAN YERN,"""They are heroes strong and bold"
48,ULF VAN YERN,Who have battles often won;
49,ULF VAN YERN,Feared are they in every land
50,ULF VAN YERN,"Where their names' renown has gone."""
51,ULF VAN YERN,
52,ULF VAN YERN,"In walked he, the good Dane King,"
53,ULF VAN YERN,Glittering like the morning star:
54,ULF VAN YERN,"""Which of ye, my Danish swains,"
55,ULF VAN YERN,"Will attend my friend to war?"""
56,ULF VAN YERN,
57,ULF VAN YERN,"Stalked the King along the floor,"
58,ULF VAN YERN,Bore a gold cup in his hand:
59,ULF VAN YERN,"""Which of ye, my courtmen, will,"
60,ULF VAN YERN,"Follow Wolf with shield and brand?"""
61,ULF VAN YERN,
62,ULF VAN YERN,"To their mouths their hats they held,"
63,ULF VAN YERN,"None to answer him made haste,"
64,ULF VAN YERN,"Save bold Vidrik Verlandson,"
65,ULF VAN YERN,Of them all he made a jest.
66,ULF VAN YERN,
67,ULF VAN YERN,It was Vidrik Verlandson
68,ULF VAN YERN,Of his comrades made a sport:
69,ULF VAN YERN,"""Sure 'tis but to guzzle mead"
70,ULF VAN YERN,"We are gathered here at court."""
71,ULF VAN YERN,
72,ULF VAN YERN,"Wrathful Diderik straight became,"
73,ULF VAN YERN,Frantic at that word he grew;
74,ULF VAN YERN,"Off he smote two warriors' heads,"
75,ULF VAN YERN,At the King's foot them he threw.
76,ULF VAN YERN,
77,ULF VAN YERN,"Then spake Vidrik Verlandson,"
78,ULF VAN YERN,His whole thought on honor lies:
79,ULF VAN YERN,"""We'll dispatch our messenger"
80,ULF VAN YERN,"And not go in stealthy guise."""
81,ULF VAN YERN,
82,ULF VAN YERN,It was youthful Hammergray
83,ULF VAN YERN,Hurried from the city gate;
84,ULF VAN YERN,Every one on him that looked
85,ULF VAN YERN,Lost his voice and colour straight.
86,ULF VAN YERN,
87,ULF VAN YERN,"Hark away, young Hammergray,"
88,ULF VAN YERN,Gold is glittering on thy breast;
89,ULF VAN YERN,Ne'er was found or hawk or hound
90,ULF VAN YERN,Could with Hammer's speed contest.
91,ULF VAN YERN,
92,ULF VAN YERN,"Pearls upon his bosom shone,"
93,ULF VAN YERN,Folks thereat astounded gaze:
94,ULF VAN YERN,Fowl was none beneath the sun
95,ULF VAN YERN,Could with youthful Hammer race.
96,ULF VAN YERN,
97,ULF VAN YERN,Swift into the King's high hill
98,ULF VAN YERN,Bounded youthful Hammergray:
99,ULF VAN YERN,"He was nimble at the tongue,"
100,ULF VAN YERN,And could speak in gallant way.
101,ULF VAN YERN,
102,ULF VAN YERN,"""King of Brattens Vendel, hail!"
103,ULF VAN YERN,And the rest that fill your hall;
104,ULF VAN YERN,Ulf Van Yern to-morrow comes
105,ULF VAN YERN,"To avenge his father's fall."""
106,ULF VAN YERN,
107,ULF VAN YERN,"""Better had he be at home"
108,ULF VAN YERN,"Tending sheep beneath the height,"
109,ULF VAN YERN,Better than a message send
110,ULF VAN YERN,That he thither comes to fight.
111,ULF VAN YERN,
112,ULF VAN YERN,"""Better had he crawl at home"
113,ULF VAN YERN,"Like a worm the rock beneath,"
114,ULF VAN YERN,Than the war-like struggle dare
115,ULF VAN YERN,Where his father sank in death.
116,ULF VAN YERN,
117,ULF VAN YERN,"""He at home had better stay,"
118,ULF VAN YERN,Crouch and shake the bush below;
119,ULF VAN YERN,"One blow only stood his sire,"
120,ULF VAN YERN,"He'll not stand me half a blow."""
121,ULF VAN YERN,
122,ULF VAN YERN,"""King of Brattens Vendel, hear,"
123,ULF VAN YERN,Keep your tongue behind your tooth;
124,ULF VAN YERN,"Quickly grows the young whelp up,"
125,ULF VAN YERN,"Full of threatening fangs his mouth."""
126,ULF VAN YERN,
127,ULF VAN YERN,"""In the world no warrior wight"
128,ULF VAN YERN,"Lives for whom I need to care,"
129,ULF VAN YERN,"Save 'tis Vidrik Verlandson,"
130,ULF VAN YERN,"And I trow he'll not be there."""
131,ULF VAN YERN,
132,ULF VAN YERN,"Answered then the Hammergray,"
133,ULF VAN YERN,Answered to the Monarch's fright:
134,ULF VAN YERN,"""It is Vidrik Verlandson"
135,ULF VAN YERN,"Will our army lead in fight."""
136,ULF VAN YERN,
137,ULF VAN YERN,"Rose a Brattens Vendel kemp,"
138,ULF VAN YERN,And he shouted lustily:
139,ULF VAN YERN,"""Well, full well, I Vidrik know,"
140,ULF VAN YERN,Offspring of a blacksmith he.
141,ULF VAN YERN,
142,ULF VAN YERN,"""Once was I at Birtingsborg"
143,ULF VAN YERN,"As the kempions drank their fill,"
144,ULF VAN YERN,There he played a play which lives
145,ULF VAN YERN,"In my mind, and ever will."
146,ULF VAN YERN,
147,ULF VAN YERN,"""Fifteen kemps to death he smote,"
148,ULF VAN YERN,And he deemed it but as game;
149,ULF VAN YERN,"Nigh at hand I gazing stood,"
150,ULF VAN YERN,"Ashy pale my cheeks became."""
151,ULF VAN YERN,
152,ULF VAN YERN,"""Listen now, young Hammergray,"
153,ULF VAN YERN,"Strongly I entreat of thee,"
154,ULF VAN YERN,"If of Vidrik aught thou know,"
155,ULF VAN YERN,"Not to keep it hid from me."""
156,ULF VAN YERN,
157,ULF VAN YERN,"""Sick in bed if Vidrik lay,"
158,ULF VAN YERN,"Nor could sword nor buckler yield,"
159,ULF VAN YERN,Many a Danish swain you'd find
160,ULF VAN YERN,"Would await you in the field."""
161,ULF VAN YERN,
162,ULF VAN YERN,"Loudly answered then the King,"
163,ULF VAN YERN,Through his veins rushed courage warm:
164,ULF VAN YERN,"""I'll to-morrow, if I live,"
165,ULF VAN YERN,"Meet ye in the battle's storm."""
166,ULF VAN YERN,
167,ULF VAN YERN,From beside the King's right hand
168,ULF VAN YERN,"Rose a kemp, a stalwart one:"
169,ULF VAN YERN,"""What care we for such like foes?"
170,ULF VAN YERN,"Vidrik's but a blacksmith's son."""
171,ULF VAN YERN,
172,ULF VAN YERN,"It was the young Hammergray,"
173,ULF VAN YERN,At that word his wrath boiled o'er;
174,ULF VAN YERN,"Straight he smote the kempion dead,"
175,ULF VAN YERN,Dead he tumbled on the floor.
176,ULF VAN YERN,
177,ULF VAN YERN,"Said the Monarch with a cry,"
178,ULF VAN YERN,While with rage his cheek grew white:
179,ULF VAN YERN,"""Why hast thou my bravest kemp"
180,ULF VAN YERN,"Smit to death before my sight?"""
181,ULF VAN YERN,
182,ULF VAN YERN,"Thereto answered Hammergray,"
183,ULF VAN YERN,As the King he fiercely eyed:
184,ULF VAN YERN,"""I could ne'er with patience hear"
185,ULF VAN YERN,"Verland's valiant son decried."""
186,ULF VAN YERN,
187,ULF VAN YERN,"Straight away rushed Hammergray,"
188,ULF VAN YERN,Soon he stood by Vidrik knight:
189,ULF VAN YERN,"""Whet your spears, and sharp your swords,"
190,ULF VAN YERN,"For the King is bent on fight."""
191,ULF VAN YERN,
192,ULF VAN YERN,All the mirky night they rode
193,ULF VAN YERN,"O'er the dusky heathery down,"
194,ULF VAN YERN,Still a light like that of day
195,ULF VAN YERN,From their polished weapons shone.
196,ULF VAN YERN,
197,ULF VAN YERN,"Over Birting's moor they rode,"
198,ULF VAN YERN,And through Birting's swamp in haste;
199,ULF VAN YERN,"Full seven hundred were the kemps,"
200,ULF VAN YERN,All in hard cuirasses cas'd.
201,ULF VAN YERN,
202,ULF VAN YERN,"Towards Birting on they rode,"
203,ULF VAN YERN,Birting's city they rode through;
204,ULF VAN YERN,"Then they formed them in a ring,"
205,ULF VAN YERN,And made Vidrik chief anew.
206,ULF VAN YERN,
207,ULF VAN YERN,"On the down their flag they pitched,"
208,ULF VAN YERN,Therein you a lion may spy;
209,ULF VAN YERN,Now must many an innocent man
210,ULF VAN YERN,Bid to life a long good-bye!
211,ULF VAN YERN,
212,ULF VAN YERN,"Long they fought with sword and bow,"
213,ULF VAN YERN,Each essayed his best to do;
214,ULF VAN YERN,"From their brows burst ruddy sweat,"
215,ULF VAN YERN,From their bucklers fire out flew.
216,ULF VAN YERN,
217,ULF VAN YERN,"It was then the Vendel King,"
218,ULF VAN YERN,From his helm a glance he cast:
219,ULF VAN YERN,"""Say, who leads that band to-day,"
220,ULF VAN YERN,"That my people fall so fast?"""
221,ULF VAN YERN,
222,ULF VAN YERN,"Straight replied the little page,"
223,ULF VAN YERN,To the King rode next of all:
224,ULF VAN YERN,"""Sir, 'tis Vidrik Verlandson,"
225,ULF VAN YERN,"Sits upon his courser tall."""
226,ULF VAN YERN,
227,ULF VAN YERN,"Answered one of the King's kemps,"
228,ULF VAN YERN,Who had been in many fields:
229,ULF VAN YERN,"""Yes, 'tis Vidrik Verlandson,"
230,ULF VAN YERN,"Mimmering {13} in his hand he wields."""
231,ULF VAN YERN,
232,ULF VAN YERN,"Thereto made the King reply,"
233,ULF VAN YERN,As another glance he throws:
234,ULF VAN YERN,"""'Gainst the shield I ill shall fight"
235,ULF VAN YERN,Which the tongs and hammer shows.
236,ULF VAN YERN,
237,ULF VAN YERN,"""'Gainst the shield I ill shall fight"
238,ULF VAN YERN,"Which the tongs and hammer bears,"
239,ULF VAN YERN,"This day I am doomed to die,"
240,ULF VAN YERN,For fierce Vidrik no one spares.
241,ULF VAN YERN,
242,ULF VAN YERN,"""Heathen wight, and Christian knight,"
243,ULF VAN YERN,I would fight with glad and fain;
244,ULF VAN YERN,"Only not with Verland's son,"
245,ULF VAN YERN,"For from him I scathe must gain."""
246,ULF VAN YERN,
247,ULF VAN YERN,Ha! Hurrah! the Vendel King
248,ULF VAN YERN,In his steed the rowels drove;
249,ULF VAN YERN,"Desperate he at Vidrik went,"
250,ULF VAN YERN,Desperate he to fell him strove.
251,ULF VAN YERN,
252,ULF VAN YERN,"Bravely done, thou Vendel King,"
253,ULF VAN YERN,Fast and hard thy strokes are plied
254,ULF VAN YERN,E'en to his good saddle bow
255,ULF VAN YERN,Vidrik stoops his helm of pride.
256,ULF VAN YERN,
257,ULF VAN YERN,"""I've from thee borne eighteen blows,"
258,ULF VAN YERN,"They are, Sir, nor more nor fewer,"
259,ULF VAN YERN,For thy kingly honor now
260,ULF VAN YERN,"But one blow from me endure."""
261,ULF VAN YERN,
262,ULF VAN YERN,"""If thou eighteen blows hast borne"
263,ULF VAN YERN,"Be they fewer or be they more,"
264,ULF VAN YERN,"I'll the self-same number take,"
265,ULF VAN YERN,"Gift of love can break their power."""
266,ULF VAN YERN,
267,ULF VAN YERN,Forth a silken thread he drew
268,ULF VAN YERN,Tied it round his helm of gold:
269,ULF VAN YERN,"""My heart's dear shall never hear"
270,ULF VAN YERN,"Blow of blacksmith laid me cold."""
271,ULF VAN YERN,
272,ULF VAN YERN,Vidrik spake to Mimmering:
273,ULF VAN YERN,"""Show thou'rt yet for something good;"
274,ULF VAN YERN,I can say for fifteen years
275,ULF VAN YERN,"I more fiercely have not hew'd."""
276,ULF VAN YERN,
277,ULF VAN YERN,Grasped he then the hilt so hard
278,ULF VAN YERN,"From his nails that blood outstarted,"
279,ULF VAN YERN,"On the Monarch's helm he hew'd,"
280,ULF VAN YERN,To the navel him he parted.
281,ULF VAN YERN,
282,ULF VAN YERN,"Shouted Vidrik Verlandson,"
283,ULF VAN YERN,Standing on the verdant height:
284,ULF VAN YERN,"""Be there one of all your host"
285,ULF VAN YERN,"Who has further wish to fight?"""
286,ULF VAN YERN,
287,ULF VAN YERN,Now the Brattens Vendel King
288,ULF VAN YERN,Lies out pouring blood like water:
289,ULF VAN YERN,"Vengeance now has Ulf Van Yern,"
290,ULF VAN YERN,Vengeance for his father's slaughter.
291,ULF VAN YERN,
292,ULF VAN YERN,It was youthful Hammergray
293,ULF VAN YERN,Glanced around the bloody field:
294,ULF VAN YERN,"""So like mice in their first sleep"
295,ULF VAN YERN,"Hushed the foemen lie, and still'd."""
296,ULF VAN YERN,
297,ULF VAN YERN,Gladly back with Ulf Van Yern
298,ULF VAN YERN,Rode the Dane King's chivalry;
299,ULF VAN YERN,For his sire avenged he thanked
300,ULF VAN YERN,Vidrik oft and fervently.

305,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT
306,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
307,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
308,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Sir Oluf rode forth over hill and lea
309,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Full seven mile broad and seven mile wide,"
310,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,But no one living discovered he
311,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Who a joust with him dare ride.
312,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
313,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"He saw, whilst forward glancing,"
314,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"A gallant knight advancing,"
315,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Black was his courser, his helm was lac'd,"
316,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,He came with bounding haste.
317,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
318,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Upon his spurs all gory
319,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Twelve gilded birdies bore he;
320,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Each time with the rowel he pricked his horse
321,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,The birdies sang with all their force.
322,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
323,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Twelve gilt wheels on his bridle
324,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"He bore, nor were they idle;"
325,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Each time through them the breezes blew,"
326,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,How quickly around the little wheels flew.
327,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
328,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,He carried before his breast
329,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"A long lance, placed in rest;"
330,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Far sharper than diamond was that lance,"
331,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,It laid Sir Oluf in deadly trance.
332,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
333,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Aloft on his helm he show'd
334,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,A chaplet of red glare;
335,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Three maidens in proof of their love bestow'd,"
336,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,The youngest was so fair.
337,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
338,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Sir Oluf enquired of the knight,"
339,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,An he were come down from the realms of light:
340,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"""Art thou the Christ, for if thou be,"
341,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"I'll willingly bend before thee the knee?"""
342,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
343,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"""I am not the Christ of power,"
344,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Thou need'st not before me cower;
345,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"An unknown knight thou see'st in me,"
346,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Sent forth by three maids of high degree."""
347,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
348,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"""If thou be a chosen knight"
349,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Whom maidens three have sent this way,"
350,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Then for love of those damsels bright,"
351,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Thou shalt joust with me to-day."""
352,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
353,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,The first course they together rode
354,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Of their coursers trial made they,"
355,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,The second course they together rode
356,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Their best manhood well display'd they.
357,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
358,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,The third joust they together rode
359,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Neither one the other humbled,"
360,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,But the fourth joust they together rode
361,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,Dead to the green earth they tumbled.
362,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,
363,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"Now on the wold the heroes lie,"
364,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,With their blood the grass is red;
365,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,"In the chamber high sit the maids and sigh,"
366,THE CHOSEN KNIGHT,But the youngest soon is dead.

372,SIR SWERKEL,
373,SIR SWERKEL,
374,SIR SWERKEL,"There's a dance in the hall of Sir Swerkel the Childe,"
375,SIR SWERKEL,"There dances fair Kirstine, her hair hanging wild."
376,SIR SWERKEL,
377,SIR SWERKEL,"There dance the good King and his nobles so gay,"
378,SIR SWERKEL,Fair Kirstine before them she warbles a lay.
379,SIR SWERKEL,
380,SIR SWERKEL,His hand to the maiden Sir Swerkel stretched free:
381,SIR SWERKEL,"""Come hither and dance, little Kirstine, with me."""
382,SIR SWERKEL,
383,SIR SWERKEL,"Her finger he pressed, and moved up to her near:"
384,SIR SWERKEL,"""Sweet Kirstine, I pray thee become my heart's dear."""
385,SIR SWERKEL,
386,SIR SWERKEL,"Her finger he pressed, on her sandal trod he:"
387,SIR SWERKEL,"""Fair Kirstine, with pity my agonies see!"""
388,SIR SWERKEL,
389,SIR SWERKEL,"They danced to the left, and they danced to the right,"
390,SIR SWERKEL,And her troth the fair damsel bestowed on the knight.
391,SIR SWERKEL,
392,SIR SWERKEL,"Upon him Sir Swerkel his red mantle throws,"
393,SIR SWERKEL,And to the high hall to his mother he goes.
394,SIR SWERKEL,
395,SIR SWERKEL,"""Hail, hail as thou sittest here, dear mother mine!"
396,SIR SWERKEL,"I come from betrothing the little Kirstine."""
397,SIR SWERKEL,
398,SIR SWERKEL,"""Our Lady forbid, and our Lady forfend,"
399,SIR SWERKEL,Relations like ye to betroth should pretend.
400,SIR SWERKEL,
401,SIR SWERKEL,"""In wedlock united ye never must be,"
402,SIR SWERKEL,"For brother and sister, believe me, are ye."""
403,SIR SWERKEL,
404,SIR SWERKEL,"""Now tell me, I pray thee, O dear mother mine!"
405,SIR SWERKEL,"What time thou didst bring forth the little Kirstine."""
406,SIR SWERKEL,
407,SIR SWERKEL,"""The time that thou wast on thy journey to Rome,"
408,SIR SWERKEL,I bore the sweet flowret that's now in full bloom.
409,SIR SWERKEL,
410,SIR SWERKEL,"""Whilst thou to the sepulchre holy wast gone,"
411,SIR SWERKEL,I bore the fair mirror thy love that hast won.
412,SIR SWERKEL,
413,SIR SWERKEL,"""In the court of the Queen she was reared up with care,"
414,SIR SWERKEL,"And scarlet and sable accustomed to wear."""
415,SIR SWERKEL,
416,SIR SWERKEL,"""Now give me thy counsel, O dear mother mine,"
417,SIR SWERKEL,"How I may forget her, the little Kirstine?"""
418,SIR SWERKEL,
419,SIR SWERKEL,"""Go chase thou the hart, and go chase thou the hind,"
420,SIR SWERKEL,And thou wilt her image soon chase from thy mind.
421,SIR SWERKEL,
422,SIR SWERKEL,"""Go chase thou the hart, and go chase thou the roe,"
423,SIR SWERKEL,"And thou thy love-longing wilt quickly forego."""
424,SIR SWERKEL,
425,SIR SWERKEL,"He chased the proud hart, and he chased the swift hind,"
426,SIR SWERKEL,But he never could chase the fair maid from his mind.
427,SIR SWERKEL,
428,SIR SWERKEL,"He chased the tall hart, and he chased the sleek roe,"
429,SIR SWERKEL,But the longing of love from his mind would not go.
430,SIR SWERKEL,
431,SIR SWERKEL,"So the knight from the country was driven at last,"
432,SIR SWERKEL,And into a cloister the maiden was cast.
433,SIR SWERKEL,
434,SIR SWERKEL,No little bird shaped from the far land its flight
435,SIR SWERKEL,Than enquiry she made for her dear betrothed knight.
436,SIR SWERKEL,
437,SIR SWERKEL,A bird ne'er so little across the sea stray'd
438,SIR SWERKEL,But he enquired after his dear betrothed maid.
