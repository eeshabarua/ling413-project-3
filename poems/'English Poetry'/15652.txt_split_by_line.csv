35,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.
36,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
37,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
38,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,There were scarcely any events in the life of Thomas Hood. One
39,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,condition there was of too potent determining importance--life-long ill
40,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"health; and one circumstance of moment--a commercial failure, and"
41,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"consequent expatriation. Beyond this, little presents itself for record"
42,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"in the outward facts of this upright and beneficial career, bright with"
43,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"genius and coruscating with wit, dark with the lengthening and deepening"
44,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,shadow of death.
45,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
46,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,The father of Thomas Hood was engaged in business as a publisher and
47,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"bookseller in the Poultry, in the city of London,--a member of the firm"
48,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"of Vernor, Hood, and Sharpe. He was a Scotchman, and had come up to the"
49,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"capital early in life, to make his way. His interest in books was not"
50,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,solely confined to their saleable quality. He reprinted various old
51,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"works with success; published Bloomfield's poems, and dealt handsomely"
52,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"with him; and was himself the author of two novels, which are stated to"
53,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,have had some success in their day. For the sake of the son rather than
54,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the father, one would like to see some account, with adequate"
55,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"specimens, of these long-forgotten tales; for the queries which Thomas"
56,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Hood asks concerning the piteous woman of his _Bridge of Sighs_
57,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"interest us all concerning a man of genius, and interest us moreover"
58,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,with regard to the question of intellectual as well as natural
59,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,affinity:--
60,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
61,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"""Who was his father,"
62,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Who was his mother?
63,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Had he a sister,"
64,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Had he a brother?"""
65,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
66,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Another line of work in which the elder Hood is recorded to have been
67,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,active was the opening of the English book-trade with America. He
68,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"married a sister of the engraver Mr. Sands, and had by her a large"
69,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,family; two sons and four daughters survived the period of childhood.
70,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"The elder brother, James, who died early of consumption, drew well, as"
71,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"did also one or two of the sisters. It would seem therefore, when we"
72,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,recall Thomas Hood's aptitudes and frequent miscellaneous practice in
73,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the same line, that a certain tendency towards fine art, as well as"
74,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"towards literature, ran in the family. The consumption which killed"
75,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"James appears to have been inherited from his mother; she, and two of"
76,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"her daughters, died of the same disease; and a pulmonary affection of a"
77,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"somewhat different kind became, as we shall see, one of the poet's most"
78,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"inveterate persecutors. The death of the father, which was sudden and"
79,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"unexpected, preceded that of the mother, but not of James, and left the"
80,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,survivors in rather straitened circumstances.
81,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
82,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Thomas, the second of the two sons, was born in the Poultry, on or"
83,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"about the 23d of May, 1799. He is stated to have been a retired child,"
84,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"with much quiet humor; chuckling, we may guess, over his own quaint"
85,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"imaginings, which must have come in crowds, and of all conceivable or"
86,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"inconceivable sorts, to judge from the products of his after years;"
87,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"keeping most of these fancies and surprises to himself, but every now"
88,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"and then letting some of them out, and giving homely or stolid"
89,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,bystanders an inkling of insight into the many-peopled crannies of his
90,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,boyish brain. He received his education at Dr. Wanostrocht's school at
91,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Clapham. It is not very clear how far this education extended:[1] I
92,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"should infer that it was just about enough, and not more than enough,"
93,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"to enable Hood to shift for himself in the career of authorship,"
94,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"without serious disadvantage from inadequate early training, and also"
95,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"without much aid thence derived--without, at any rate, any such rousing"
96,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,and refining of the literary sense as would warrant us in attributing
97,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"to educational influences either the inclination to become an author,"
98,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,or the manipulative power over language and style which Hood displayed
99,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"in his serious poems, not to speak of those of a lighter kind. We seem"
100,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"to see him sliding, as it were, into the profession of letters, simply"
101,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"through capacity and liking, and the course of events--not because he"
102,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"had resolutely made up his mind to be an author, nor because his"
103,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,natural faculty had been steadily or studiously cultivated. As to
104,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"details, it may be remarked that his schooling included some"
105,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,amount--perhaps a fair average amount--of Latin. We find it stated that
106,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"he had a Latin prize at school, but was not apt at the language in"
107,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,later years. He had however one kind of aptitude at it--being addicted
108,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"to the use of familiar Latin quotations or phrases, cited with humorous"
109,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,verbal perversions.
110,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
111,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"[Footnote 1: The authority--I might almost say, the _one_"
112,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"authority--for the life of Hood, is the _Memorials_ published by his"
113,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,son and daughter. Any point which is not clearly brought out in that
114,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,affectionate and interesting record will naturally be equally or more
115,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"indefinite in my brief summary, founded as it is on the _Memorials_.]"
116,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
117,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"In all the relations of family life, and the forms of family affection,"
118,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Hood was simply exemplary. The deaths of his elder brother and of his
119,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"father left him the principal reliance of his mother, herself destined"
120,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,soon to follow them to the tomb: he was an excellent and devoted son.
121,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"His affection for one of his sisters, Anne, who also died shortly"
122,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"afterwards, is attested in the beautiful lines named _The Deathbed_,--"
123,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
124,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"""We watched her breathing through the night."""
125,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
126,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"At a later date, the loves of a husband and a father seem to have"
127,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,absorbed by far the greater part of his nature and his thoughts: his
128,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"letters to friends are steeped and drenched In ""Jane,"" ""Fanny,"" and"
129,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"""Tom junior."" These letters are mostly divided between perpetual family"
130,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"details and perennial jocularity: a succession of witticisms, or at"
131,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"lowest of puns and whimsicalities, mounts up like so many squibs and"
132,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"crackers, fizzing through, sparkling amid, or ultimately extinguished"
133,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"by, the inevitable shower--the steady rush and downpour--of the"
134,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,home-affections. It may easily be inferred from this account that there
135,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"are letters which one is inclined to read more thoroughly, and in"
136,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"greater number consecutively, than Hood's."
137,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
138,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"The vocation first selected for Hood, towards the age of fifteen, was"
139,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,one which he did not follow up for long--that of an engraver. He was
140,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"apprenticed to his uncle Mr. Sands, and afterwards to one of the Le"
141,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Keux family. The occupation was ill-suited to his constantly ailing
142,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"health, and this eventually conduced to his abandoning it. He then went"
143,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"to Scotland to recruit, remaining there among his relatives about five"
144,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"years.[2] According to a statement made by himself, he was in a"
145,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"merchant's office within this interval; it is uncertain, however,"
146,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"whether this assertion is to be accepted as genuine, or as made for"
147,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,some purpose of fun. His first published writing appeared in the
148,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"_Dundee Advertiser_ in 1814--his age being then, at the utmost, fifteen"
149,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,and a half; this was succeeded by some contribution to a local
150,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,magazine. But as yet he had no idea of authorship as a profession.
151,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
152,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"[Footnote 2: ""Two years,"" according to the _Memorials_; but the dates"
153,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,for this portion of Hood's life are not accurately given in that work.
154,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Hood completed the fifteenth year of his age in May, 1814. It is"
155,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"certain, from the dates of his letters, that his sojourn in Scotland"
156,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"began not later than September, 1815; and the writer of the _Memorials_"
157,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"himself affirms that Hood ""returned to London about 1820,"" in or before"
158,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"July. If so, he was in Scotland about _five_ years; and, from the fact"
159,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"that he had written in a Dundee newspaper in 1814, one might even"
160,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"surmise that the term of six years was nearer the mark. At any rate, as"
161,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"he had reached Scotland by September, 1815, he was there soon after"
162,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"completing his sixteenth year: yet Mr. Hessey (_Memorials_, p. 23) says"
163,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"that he was articled to the engraving business ""at the age of fifteen"
164,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"or sixteen,"" and his apprenticeship, according to Mr. Hood, junior,"
165,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"lasted ""some years"" even _before_ his transfer from Mr. Sands to Mr. Le"
166,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Keux. The apprenticeship did not begin until after the father's death;
167,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"but the year of that death is left unspecified, though the day and"
168,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"month are given. These dates, as the reader will readily perceive, are"
169,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"sometimes vague, and sometimes contradictory. In the text of my notice,"
170,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,I have endeavored to pick my way through their discrepancies.]
171,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
172,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Towards the middle of the year 1820, Hood was re-settled in London,"
173,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"improved in health, and just come of age. At first he continued"
174,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,practising as an engraver; but in 1821 he began to act as a sort of
175,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"sub-editor for the _London Magazine_ after the death of the editor,"
176,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Mr. Scott, in a duel. He concocted fictitious and humorous answers to"
177,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,correspondents--a humble yet appropriate introduction to the insatiable
178,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,habit and faculty for out-of-the-way verbal jocosity which marked-off
179,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,his after career from that of all other excellent poets.
180,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
181,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"His first regular contribution to the magazine, in July, 1821, was a"
182,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"little poem _To Hope_: even before this, as early at any rate as 1815,"
183,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,he was in the frequent practice of writing correctly and at some length
184,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"in verse, as witnessed by selections, now in print, from what he had"
185,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"composed for the amusement of his relatives. Soon afterwards, a private"
186,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,literary society was the recipient of other verses of the same order.
187,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"The lines _To Hope_ were followed, in the _London Magazine_, by the"
188,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"_Ode to Dr. Kitchener_ and some further poems, including the important"
189,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"work, _Lycus the Centaur_--after the publication of which, there could"
190,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,not be much doubt of the genuine and uncommon powers of the new writer.
191,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,The last contribution of Hood to this magazine was the _Lines to a Cold
192,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Beauty_. Another early work of his, and one which, like the verses _To"
193,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the Moon_, affords marked evidence of the impression which he had"
194,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"received from Keats's poetry, is the unfinished drama (or, as he termed"
195,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"it, ""romance"") of _Lamia_: I do not find its precise date recorded. Its"
196,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"verse is lax, and its tone somewhat immature; yet it shows a great deal"
197,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,of sparkling and diversified talent. Hood certainly takes a rather more
198,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"rational view than Keats did of his subject as a moral invention, or a"
199,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,myth having some sort of meaning at its root. A serpent transformed
200,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"into a woman, who beguiles a youth of the highest hopes into amorous"
201,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"languid self-abandonment, is clearly not, in morals, the sort of person"
202,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,that ought to be left uncontrolled to her own devices. Keats
203,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,ostentatiously resents the action of the unimpassioned philosopher
204,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Appollonius in revealing the true nature of the woman-serpent, and"
205,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,dissolving her spell. An elderly pedant to interfere with the pretty
206,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,whims of a viper when she wears the outer semblance of a fine woman!
207,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Intolerable!
208,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
209,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,(Such is the sentiment of Keats; but such plainly is not altogether the
210,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"conviction of Hood, although his story remains but partially"
211,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,developed.)
212,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
213,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,By this time it may have become pretty clear to himself and others that
214,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,his proper vocation and destined profession was literature. Through the
215,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"_London Magazine_, he got to know John Hamilton Reynolds (author of the"
216,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"_Garden of Florence_ and other poems, and a contributor to this serial"
217,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"under the pseudonym of Edward Herbert), Charles Lamb, Allan Cunningham,"
218,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"De Quincey, and other writers of reputation. To Hood the most directly"
219,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,important of all these acquaintances was Mr. Reynolds; this gentleman
220,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"having a sister, Jane, to whom Hood was introduced. An attachment"
221,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"ensued, and shortly terminated in marriage, the wedding taking place on"
222,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the 5th of May, 1824. The father of Miss Reynolds was the head"
223,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,writing-master at Christ Hospital. She is stated to have had good
224,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"manners, a cultivated mind, and literary tastes, though a high"
225,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,educational standard is not always traceable in her letters. At any
226,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,rate the marriage was a happy one; Mrs. Hood being a tender and
227,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"attentive wife, unwearied in the cares which her husband's precarious"
228,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"health demanded, and he being (as I have said) a mirror of marital"
229,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"constancy and devotion, distinguishable from a lover rather by his"
230,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,intense delight in all domestic relations and details than by any
231,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"cooling-down in his fondness. It would appear that, in the later years"
232,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"of Hood's life, he was not on entirely good terms with some members of"
233,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"his wife's family, including his old friend John Hamilton Reynolds."
234,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,What may have caused this I do not find specified: all that we know of
235,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,the character of Hood justifies us in thinking that he was little or
236,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"not at all to blame, for he appears throughout a man of just,"
237,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"honorable, and loving nature, and free besides from that sort of"
238,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"self-assertion which invites a collision. Every one, however, has his"
239,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,blemishes; and we may perhaps discern in Hood a certain over-readiness
240,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"to think himself imposed upon, and the fellow-creatures with whom he"
241,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,had immediately to do a generation of vipers--a state of feeling not
242,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"characteristic of a mind exalted and magnanimous by habit, or ""gentle"""
243,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,in the older and more significant meaning of the term.
244,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
245,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,The time was now come for Hood to venture a volume upon the world.
246,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Conjointly with Reynolds, he wrote, and published in 1825, his _Odes"
247,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,and Addresses to Great People_. The title-page bore no author's name;
248,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,but the extraordinary talent and point of the work could hardly fail to
249,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"be noticed, even apart from its appeal to immediate popularity, dealing"
250,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,as it did so continually with the uppermost topics of the day. It had
251,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"what it deserved, a great success. This volume was followed, in 1826,"
252,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"by the first series of _Whims and Oddities_, which also met with a good"
253,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,sale; the second series appeared in 1827. Next came two volumes of
254,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"_National Tales_, somewhat after the manner of Boccaccio (but how far"
255,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"different from his spirit may easily be surmised), which are now little"
256,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"known. The volume containing the _Plea of the Midsummer Fairies, Hero"
257,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"and Leander_, and some other of Hood's most finished and noticeable"
258,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"poems, came out in 1827. _The Midsummer Fairies_ itself was one of the"
259,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"authors own favorite works, and certainly deserved to be so, as far as"
260,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,dainty elegance of motive and of execution is concerned: but the
261,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,conception was a little too ingeniously remote for the public to ratify
262,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,the author's predilection. The _Hero and Leander_ will be at once
263,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,recognized as modelled on the style of Elizabethan narrative poems:
264,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"indeed Marlow treated the very same subject, and his poem, left"
265,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"uncompleted, was finished by Chapman. Hood's is a most astonishing"
266,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,example of revivalist poetry: it is reproductive and spontaneous at the
267,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"same time. It resembles its models closely, not"
268,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"servilely--significantly, not mechanically; and has the great merit of"
269,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,resembling them with comparative moderation. Elizabethan here both in
270,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"spirit and in letter, Hood is nevertheless a little less extreme than"
271,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"his prototypes. Where they loaded, he does not find it needful to"
272,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"overload, which is the ready and almost the inevitable resource of"
273,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"revivalists, all but the fewest: on the contrary, he alleviates a"
274,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"little,--but only a little."
275,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
276,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,In 1829 appeared the most famous of all his poems of a narrative
277,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"character--_The Dream of Eugene Aram_; it was published in the _Gem_,"
278,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,an annual which the poet was then editing. Besides this amount of
279,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"literary activity, Hood continued writing in periodicals, sometimes"
280,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"under the signature of ""Theodore M."""
281,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
282,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"His excessive and immeasurable addiction to rollicking fun, to the"
283,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"perpetual ""cracking of jokes"" (for it amounts to that more definitely"
284,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"than to anything else in the domain of the Comic Muse), is a somewhat"
285,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"curious problem, taken in connection with his remarkable genius and"
286,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"accomplishment as a poet, and his personal character as a solid"
287,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"housekeeping citizen, bent chiefly upon rearing his family in"
288,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"respectability, and paying his way, or, as the Church Catechism has"
289,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"neatly and unimprovably expressed it, upon ""doing his duty in that"
290,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"state of life to which it had pleased God to call him."" His almost"
291,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"constant ill-health, and, in a minor degree, the troubles which beset"
292,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"him in money-matters, make the problem all the more noticeable. The"
293,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,influence of Charles Lamb may have had something to do with
294,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"it,--probably not very much. Perhaps there was something in the"
295,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,literary atmosphere or the national tone of the time which gave
296,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,comicality a turn of predominance after the subsiding of the great
297,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,poetic wave which filled the last years of the eighteenth and the first
298,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"quarter of the nineteenth century in our country, in Blake, Burns,"
299,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Wordsworth, Scott, Coleridge, Landor, Byron, Keats, and, supreme among"
300,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"all, Shelley. Something of the same transition may be noticed in the"
301,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,art of design; the multifarious illustrator in the prior generation is
302,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Stothard,--in the later, Cruikshank. At any rate, in literature, Lamb,"
303,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Hood, and then Dickens in his earliest works, the _Sketches by Boz_ and"
304,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"_Pickwick_, are uncommonly characteristic and leading minds, and bent,"
305,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"with singular inveteracy, upon being ""funny,""--though not funny and"
306,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,nothing else at all. But we should not force this consideration too
307,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"far: Hood is a central figure in the group and the period, and the"
308,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,tendency of the time may be almost as much due to him as he to the
309,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"tendency. Mainly, we have to fall back upon his own idiosyncrasy: he"
310,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"was born with a boundlessly whimsical perception, which he trained into"
311,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,an inimitable sleight-of-hand in the twisting of notions and of words;
312,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,circumstances favored his writing for fugitive publications and
313,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"skimming readers, rather than under conditions of greater permanency;"
314,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,and the result is as we find it in his works. His son expresses the
315,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,opinion that part of Hood's success in comic writing arose from his
316,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"early reading of _Humphrey Clinker_, _Tristram Shandy_, _Tom Jones_,"
317,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"and other works of that period, and imbuing himself with their style: a"
318,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"remark, however, which applies to his prose rather than his poetical"
319,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"works. Certain it is that the appetite for all kinds of fun, verbal and"
320,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,other was a part of Hood's nature. We see it in the practical jokes he
321,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,was continually playing on his good-humored wife--such as altering into
322,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,grotesque absurdity many of the words contained in her letters to
323,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"friends: we see it--the mere animal love of jocularity, as it might be"
324,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,termed--in such a small point as his frequently addressing his friend
325,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Philip de Franck, in letters, by the words, ""Tim, says he,"" instead of"
326,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,any human appellative[3] Hood reminds us very much of one of
327,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Shakespeare's Fools (to use the word in no invidious sense) transported
328,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"into the nineteenth century,--the Fool in _King Lear_, or Touchstone."
329,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"For the occasional sallies of coarseness or ribaldry, the spirit of the"
330,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,time has substituted a _bourgeois_ good-humor which respects the family
331,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"circle, and haunts the kitchen-stairs; for the biting jeer, intended to"
332,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"make some victim uncomfortable, it gives the sarcastic or sprightly"
333,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"banter, not unconscious of an effort at moral amelioration; for the"
334,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"sententious sagacity, and humorous enjoyment of the nature of man, it"
335,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"gives bright thoughts and a humanitarian sympathy. But, on the whole,"
336,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,the intellectual personality is nearly the same: seeking by natural
337,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"affinity, and enjoying to the uttermost, whatever tends to lightness of"
338,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,heart and to ridicule--thus dwelling indeed in the region of the
339,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"commonplace and the gross, but constantly informing it with some"
340,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"suggestion of poetry, somewise side-meaning, or some form of sweetness"
341,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,and grace. These observations relate of course to Hood's humorous
342,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,poems: into his grave and pathetic poems he can import qualities still
343,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,loftier than these--though even here it is not often that he utterly
344,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"forswears quaintness and oddity. The risible, the fantastic, was his"
345,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,beacon-light; sometimes as delicate as a dell of glow-worms; sometimes
346,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"as uproarious as a bonfire; sometimes, it must be said (for he had to"
347,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"be perpetually writing whether the inspiration came or not, or his"
348,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,inspiration was too liable to come from the very platitudes and
349,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"pettinesses of everyday life), not much more brilliant than a"
350,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"rush-light, and hardly more aromatic than the snuff of a tallow candle."
351,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
352,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"[Footnote 3: This ""Tim, says he,"" is a perfect _gag_ in many of Hood's"
353,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,letters. It is curious to learn what was the kind of joke which could
354,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,assume so powerful an ascendant over the mind and associations of this
355,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"great humorist. Here it is, as given in the Hood _Memorials_ from _Sir"
356,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Jonah Barrington's Memoirs_:--
357,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
358,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"""'Tim,' says he--"
359,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'Sir,' says he--"
360,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'Fetch me my hat, says he;"
361,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'That I may go,' says he,"
362,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'To Timahoe,' says he,"
363,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'And go to the fair,' says he,"
364,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'And see all that's there,' says he.--"
365,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'First pay what you owe,' says he;"
366,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'And then you may go,' says he,"
367,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'To Timahoe,' says he,"
368,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'And go to the fair,' says he,"
369,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'And see all that's there,' says he.--"
370,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'Now by this and by that,' says he,"
371,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"'Tim, hang up my hat,' says he.""]"
372,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
373,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,We must now glance again at Hood's domestic affairs. His first child
374,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,had no mundane existence worth calling such; but has nevertheless lived
375,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,longer than most human beings in the lines which Lamb wrote for the
376,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"occasion, _On an Infant dying as soon as born_. A daughter followed,"
377,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"and in 1830 was born his son, the Tom Hood who became editor of the"
378,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"comic journal _Fun_, and died in 1874. At the time of his birth, the"
379,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"family was living at Winchmore Hill: thence they removed about 1832, to"
380,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the Lake House, Wanstead, a highly picturesque dwelling, but scanty in"
381,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,domestic comforts. The first of the _Comic Annual_ series was brought
382,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"out at Christmas, 1830. In the following couple of years, Hood did some"
383,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,theatrical work; writing the libretto for an English opera which (it is
384,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"believed) was performed at the Surrey Theatre. Its name is now unknown,"
385,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,but it had a good run in its day; a similar fate has befallen an
386,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,entertainment which he wrote for Mathews. He also composed a pantomime
387,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"for the Adelphi; and, along with Reynolds, dramatized _Gil Blas_. This"
388,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,play is understood to have been acted at Drury Lane. The novel of
389,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"_Tylney Hall_, and the poem of the _Epping Hunt_, were written at"
390,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Wanstead.
391,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
392,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Born in comfortable mediocrity, and early inured to narrow fortunes,"
393,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Hood had no doubt entered upon the literary calling without expecting
394,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"or caring to become rich. Hitherto, however, he seems to have prospered"
395,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"progressively, and to have had no reason to regret, even in a wordly"
396,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"sense, his choice of a profession. But towards the end of 1834 a"
397,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"disaster overtook him; and thenceforth, to the end of his days, he had"
398,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,nothing but tedious struggling and uphill work. To a man of his buoyant
399,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"temperament, and happy in his home, this might have been of no extreme"
400,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"consequence, if only sound health had blessed him: unfortunately, the"
401,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"very reverse was the case. Sickly hitherto, he was soon to become"
402,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,miserably and hopelessly diseased: he worked on through everything
403,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"bravely and uncomplainingly, but no doubt with keen throbs of"
404,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"discomfort, and not without detriment at times to the quality of his"
405,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,writings. The disaster adverted to was the failure of a firm with which
406,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Hood was connected, entailing severe loss upon him. With his accustomed"
407,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"probity, he refused to avail himself of any legal immunities, and"
408,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,resolved to meet his engagements in full eventually; but it became
409,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,requisite that he should withdraw from England. He proposed to settle
410,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"down in some one of the towns on the Rhine, and circumstances fixed his"
411,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,choice on Coblentz. A great storm which overtook him during the passage
412,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"to Rotterdam told damagingly on his already feeble health. Coblentz,"
413,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"which he reached in March, 1835, pleased him at first; though it was"
414,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"not long before he found himself a good deal of an Englishman, and his"
415,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,surroundings vexatiously German. After a while he came to consider a
416,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,German Jew and a Jew German nearly convertible terms; and indulged at
417,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"times in considerable acrimony of comment, such as a reader of"
418,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"cosmopolitan temper is not inclined to approve. He had, however, at"
419,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,least one very agreeable acquaintance at Coblentz--Lieutenant Philip de
420,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Franck, an officer in the Prussian service, of partly English"
421,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,parentage: the good-fellowship which he kept up with this amiable
422,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"gentleman, both in personal intercourse and by letter, was (as we have"
423,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,seen) even boyishly vivacious and exuberant. In the first instance Hood
424,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"lived at No. 372 Castor Hof, where his family joined him in the Spring"
425,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"of 1835: about a year later, they removed to No. 752 Alten Graben."
426,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
427,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Spasms in the chest now began to be a trying and alarming symptom of
428,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"his ill-health, which, towards the end of 1836, took a turn for the"
429,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"worse; he never afterwards rallied very effectually, though the"
430,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"fluctuations were numerous--(in November, 1838, for instance, he"
431,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,fancied that a radical improvement had suddenly taken place)--and at
432,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,times the danger was imminent. The unfavorable change in question was
433,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"nearly simultaneous with a visit which he made to Berlin, accompanying"
434,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Lieutenant de Franck and his regiment, on their transfer to Bromberg:"
435,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,the rate of travelling was from fifteen to twenty English miles per
436,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"diem, for three days consecutively, and then one day of rest. Hood"
437,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,liked the simple unextortionate Saxon folk whom he encountered on the
438,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"route, and contrasted them with the Coblentzers, much to the"
439,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,disadvantage of the latter. By the beginning of December he was back in
440,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"his Rhineland home; but finally quitted it towards May, 1837. Several"
441,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,attacks of blood-spitting occurred in the interval; at one time Hood
442,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"proposed for himself the deadly-lively epitaph, ""Here lies one who spat"
443,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"more blood and made more puns than any other man."""
444,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
445,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"About this time he was engaged in writing _Up the Rhine_; performing,"
446,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"as was his wont, the greater part of the work during the night-hours."
447,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,The sojourn at Coblentz was succeeded by a sojourn at Ostend; in which
448,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"city--besides the sea, which Hood always supremely delighted in--he"
449,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"found at first more comfort in the ordinary mode of living, including"
450,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the general readiness at speaking or understanding English. Gradually,"
451,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"however, the climate, extremely damp and often cold, proved highly"
452,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"unsuitable to him; and, when he quitted Ostend in the Spring of 1840,"
453,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"at the close of nearly three years' residence there, it was apparent"
454,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,that his stay had already lasted too long. Within this period the
455,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"publication of _Hood's Own_ had occurred, and put to a severe trial"
456,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,even _his_ unrivalled fertility in jest: one of his letters speaks of
457,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the difficulty of being perfectly original in the jocose vein, more"
458,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"especially with reference to the concurrent demands of _Hood's Own_,"
459,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,and of the _Comic Annual_ of the year. At the beginning of 1839 he paid
460,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"a visit of about three weeks to his often-regretted England, staying"
461,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"with one of his oldest and most intimate friends, Mr. Dilke, then"
462,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,editor of the _Athenæum_. Another of his best friends--one indeed who
463,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,continued to the end roost unwearied and affectionate in his
464,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"professional and other attentions, Dr. Elliot--now made a medical"
465,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,examination of Hood's condition. He pronounced the lungs to be
466,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"organically sound; the chief seat of disease being the liver, and the"
467,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"heart, which was placed lower down than usual. At a later stage of the"
468,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"disease, enlargement of the heart is mentioned, along with hæmorrhage"
469,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"from the lungs consequent on that malady, and recurring with terrible"
470,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"frequency: to these dropsy, arising from extreme weakness, was"
471,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"eventually superadded. Indeed, the catalogue of the illnesses of the"
472,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"unconquerably hilarious Hood, and the details of his sufferings, are"
473,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,painful to read. They have at least the merit of giving a touch of
474,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,adventitious but intimate pathos even to some of his wildest
475,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"extravagances of verbal fence,--and of enhancing our sympathy and"
476,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"admiration for the force and beauty of his personal character, which"
477,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,could produce work such as this out of a torture of body and spirit
478,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"such as that. During this visit to London, Hood scrutinized his"
479,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"publishing and other accounts, and found them sufficiently encouraging."
480,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"The first edition of _Up the Rhine_, consisting of 1500 copies, sold"
481,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"off In a fortnight. Soon, however, some vexations with publishers"
482,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"ensued: Hood felt it requisite to take legal proceedings, and the"
483,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,action lingered on throughout and beyond the brief remainder of his
484,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"life. Thus his prospects were again blighted, and his means crippled"
485,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,when most they needed to be unembarrassed.
486,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
487,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"The poet was back in England from Ostend in April 1840; and, under"
488,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"medical advice, he determined to prolong his visit into a permanent"
489,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,re-settlement in his native London. Here therefore he remained and
490,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"returned, no more to the Continent. He took a house, with his family,"
491,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"in Camberwell, not far from the Green; removing afterwards to St."
492,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"John's Wood, and finally to another house in the same district,"
493,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Devonshire Lodge, Finchley Road. He wrote in the _New Monthly"
494,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Magazine_, then edited by Theodore Hook: his _Rhymes for the Times_,"
495,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the celebrated _Miss Kilmansegg_, and other compositions, first"
496,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"appeared here. Hook dying in August 1841, Hood was invited to succeed"
497,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"him as editor, and closed with the offer: this gave him an annual"
498,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"salary of £300, besides the separate payments for any articles that he"
499,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"wrote. The _Song of the Shirt_, which it would be futile to praise or"
500,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"even to characterize, came out, anonymously of course, in the Christmas"
501,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"number of _Punch_ for 1843: it ran like wildfire, and rang like a"
502,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"tocsin, through the land. Immediately afterwards, in January 1844,"
503,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Hood's connection with the _New Monthly_ closed, and he started a"
504,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"publication of his own, _Hood's Magazine_, which was a considerable"
505,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,success: more than half the first number was the actual handiwork of
506,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the editor. Many troubles and cross-purposes, however, beset the new"
507,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"periodical; difficulties with which Hood was ill fitted, by his now"
508,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"rapidly and fatally worsening health, to cope. They pestered him when"
509,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,he was most in need of rest; and he was in need of rest when most he
510,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"was wanted to control the enterprise. _The Haunted House_, and various"
511,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"other excellent poems by Hood, were published in this magazine."
512,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
513,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,His last days and final agonies were a little cheered by the granting
514,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"of a Government pension of £100, dating from June 1844, which, with"
515,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"kindly but ominous foresight, was conferred upon Mrs. Hood, as likely"
516,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"to prove the survivor. This was during the ministry of Sir Robert Peel,"
517,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"whose courteous communications to the poet, and expressions of direct"
518,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"personal interest in his writings, made the boon all the more"
519,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"acceptable. Hood, indeed, had not been directly concerned in soliciting"
520,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"it. At a somewhat earlier date, January 1841, the Literary Society had,"
521,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"similarly unasked, voted him a sum of £50; but this he returned,"
522,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,although his circumstances were such as might have made it by no means
523,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"unwelcome. From Christmas 1844 he was compelled to take to his bed, and"
524,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"was fated never to leave his room again. The ensuing Spring, throughout"
525,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"which the poet lay seemingly almost at the last gasp day by day, was a"
526,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"lovely one. At times he was delirious; but mostly quite clear in mind,"
527,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"and full of gentleness and resignation. ""Dying, dying,"" were his last"
528,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"words; and shortly before, ""Lord, say 'Arise, take up thy cross, and"
529,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"follow me.'"" On the 3d of May 1845 he lay dead."
530,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
531,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Hood's funeral took place in Kensal Green Cemetery: it was a quiet one,"
532,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,but many friends attended. His faithful and loving wife would not be
533,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"long divided from him. Eighteen months later she was laid beside him,"
534,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,dying of an illness first contracted from her constant tendance on his
535,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"sick-bed. In the closing period of his life, Hood could hardly bear her"
536,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"being out of his sight, or even write when she was away. Some years"
537,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"afterwards, a public subscription was got up, and a monument erected to"
538,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"mark the grave of the good man and true poet who ""sang the Song of the"
539,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Shirt."""
540,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
541,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,The face of Hood is best known by two busts and an oil-portrait which
542,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,have both been engraved from. It is a sort of face to which apparently
543,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"a bust does more than justice, yet less than right. The features, being"
544,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"mostly by no means bad ones, look better, when thus reduced to the mere"
545,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"simple and abstract contour, than they probably showed in reality, for"
546,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"no one supposed Hood to be a fine-looking man; on the other hand, the"
547,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"_value_ of the face must have been in its shifting expression--keen,"
548,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"playful, or subtle--and this can be but barely suggested by the"
549,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"sculptor. The poet's visage was pallid, his figure slight, his voice"
550,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"feeble; he always dressed in black, and is spoken of as presenting a"
551,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,generally clerical aspect. He was remarkably deficient in ear for
552,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,music--not certainly for the true chime and varied resources of verse.
553,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,His aptitude for the art of design was probably greater than might be
554,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,inferred from the many comic woodcut-drawings which he has left. These
555,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"are irresistibly ludicrous--(who would not laugh over ""The Spoiled"
556,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Child""--""What next? as the Frog said when his tail fell off""--and a"
557,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,host of others?)--and all the more ludicrous and effective for being
558,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,drawn more childishly and less artistically than was within Hood's
559,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,compass. One may occasionally see some water-color landscape-bit or the
560,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,like from his hands pleasantly done; and during his final residence in
561,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"England he acted upon an idea he had long entertained, and produced"
562,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,some little in the way of oil-painting. He was also ingenious in any
563,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"sort of light fancy-work--such, for instance, as carving the scenery"
564,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,for a child's theatre which formed the delight of his little son and
565,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"daughter. His religious faith was, according to the writers of the"
566,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"_Memorials_, deep and sincere, though his opposition to sectarian"
567,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"narrowness and spite of all sorts was vigorous, and caused him"
568,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,sometimes to be regarded as anti-religious. A letter of his to a
569,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,tract-giving and piously censorious lady who had troubled him
570,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"(published in the same book) is absolutely fierce, and indeed hardly to"
571,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"be reconciled with the courtesy due to a woman, as a mere question of"
572,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"sex. It would be convenient, I may observe, to know more plainly what"
573,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the biographers mean by such expressions as ""religious faith,"""
574,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"""Christian gentleman,"" and the like. They are not explained, for"
575,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"instance, by adding that Hood honored the Bible too much to make it a"
576,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"task-book for his children. ""Religious faith"" covers many very serious"
577,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"differences of sentiment and conviction, between natural theology and"
578,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"historical Christianity; and, on hearing that a man possessed religious"
579,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"faith, one would like to learn which of the two extremes this faith was"
580,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"more nearly conversant with. In respect of political or social opinion,"
581,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Hood appears to have been rather humane and philanthropic than
582,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"democratic, or ""liberal"" in the distinct technical sense. His favorite"
583,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"theory of government, as he said in a letter to Peel, was ""an angel"
584,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"from heaven, and a despotism."" He loved neither whigs nor tories, but"
585,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"was on the side of a national policy: war was his abhorrence, and so"
586,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"were the wicked corn-laws--an oligarchical device which survived him,"
587,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"but not for long. His private generosity, not the less true or hearty"
588,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,for the limits which a precarious and very moderate income necessarily
589,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"imposed on it, was in accordance with the general sentiments of"
590,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,kindness which he was wont to express both in public and private: if he
591,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"preached, he did not forget to practise."
592,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,
593,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"It has been well said[4] that ""the predominant characteristics of his"
594,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"genius are humorous fancies grafted upon melancholy impressions."" Yet"
595,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the term ""grafted"" seems hardly strong enough. Hood appears, by natural"
596,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"bent and permanent habit of mind, to have seen and sought for"
597,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,ludicrousness under all conditions--it was the first thing that struck
598,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,him as a matter of intellectual perception or choice. On the other
599,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"hand, his nature being poetic, his sympathies acute, and the condition"
600,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"of his life morbid, he very frequently wrote in a tone of deep and"
601,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"indeed melancholy feeling, and was a master both of his own art and of"
602,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"the reader's emotion; but, even in work of this sort, the intellectual"
603,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"execration, when it takes precedence of the general feeling, is"
604,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"continually fantastic, grotesque, or positively mirthful. And so again"
605,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,with those of his works--including rude designs along with finished or
606,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,off-hand writing--which are professedly comical: the funny twist of
607,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"thought is the essential thing, and the most gloomy or horrible"
608,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,subject-matter is often selected as the occasion for the horse-laugh.
609,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,In some of his works indeed (we might cite the poems named _The Dead
610,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Robbery_, _The Forge_, and _The Supper Superstition_) the horse-laugh"
611,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,almost passes into a nightmare laugh. A ghoul might seem to have set it
612,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"going, and laughing hyenas to be chorusing it. A man of such a faculty"
613,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"and such a habit of work could scarcely, in all instances, keep himself"
614,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,within the bounds of good taste--a term which people are far too ready
615,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"to introduce into serious discussions, for the purpose of casting"
616,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,disparagement upon some work which transcends the ordinary standards of
617,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"appreciation, but a term nevertheless which has its important meaning"
618,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"and its true place. Hood is too often like a man grinning awry, or"
619,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"interlarding serious and beautiful discourse with a nod, a wink, or a"
620,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"leer, neither requisite nor convenient as auxiliaries to his speech:"
621,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,and to do either of these things is to fail in perfect taste.
622,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"Sometimes, not very often, we are allowed to reach the close of a poem"
623,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,of his without having our attention jogged and called off by a single
624,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,interpolation of this kind; and then we feel unalloyed--what we
625,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,constantly feel also even under the contrary conditions--how exquisite
626,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,"a poetic sense and how choice a cunning of hand were his. On the whole,"
627,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,we can pronounce Hood the finest English poet between the generation of
628,BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION.,Shelley and the generation of Tennyson.

813,TO HOPE.,"Oh! take, young Seraph, take thy harp,"
814,TO HOPE.,And play to me so cheerily;
815,TO HOPE.,"For grief is dark, and care is sharp,"
816,TO HOPE.,And life wears on so wearily.
817,TO HOPE.,Oh! take thy harp!
818,TO HOPE.,"Oh! sing as thou wert wont to do,"
819,TO HOPE.,"When, all youth's sunny season long,"
820,TO HOPE.,"I sat and listened to thy song,"
821,TO HOPE.,"And yet 'twas ever, ever new,"
822,TO HOPE.,With magic in its heaven-tuned string--
823,TO HOPE.,The future bliss thy constant theme.
824,TO HOPE.,Oh! then each little woe took wing
825,TO HOPE.,"Away, like phantoms of a dream;"

829,TO HOPE.,
830,TO HOPE.,By all those bright and happy hours

832,TO HOPE.,"Where thou wouldst sit and smile, and show,"
833,TO HOPE.,"Ere buds were come, where flowers would blow,"
834,TO HOPE.,And oft anticipate the rise
835,TO HOPE.,Of life's warm sun that scaled the skies;
836,TO HOPE.,"By many a story of love and glory,"
837,TO HOPE.,And friendships promised oft to me;
838,TO HOPE.,"By all the faith I lent to thee,--"
839,TO HOPE.,"Oh! take, young Seraph, take thy harp,"

845,TO HOPE.,"Perchance the strings will sound less clear,"
846,TO HOPE.,That long have lain neglected by
847,TO HOPE.,In sorrow's misty atmosphere;
848,TO HOPE.,It ne'er may speak as it hath spoken
849,TO HOPE.,Such joyous notes so brisk and high;
850,TO HOPE.,But are its golden chords all broken?
851,TO HOPE.,"Are there not some, though weak and low,"
852,TO HOPE.,To play a lullaby to woe?
853,TO HOPE.,"But thou canst sing of love no more,"
854,TO HOPE.,For Celia show'd that dream was vain;
855,TO HOPE.,"And many a fancied bliss is o'er,"
856,TO HOPE.,That comes not e'en in dreams again.
857,TO HOPE.,Alas! alas!
858,TO HOPE.,"How pleasures pass,"

868,TO HOPE.,Another life-spring there adorns
869,TO HOPE.,Another youth--without the dread

886,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Summer is gone on swallows' wings,"
887,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,And Earth has buried all her flowers:
888,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"No more the lark,--the linnet--sings,"
889,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,But Silence sits in faded bowers.
890,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,There is a shadow on the plain
891,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Of Winter ere he comes again,--"
892,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,There is in woods a solemn sound
893,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Of hollow warnings whisper'd round,"
894,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,As Echo in her deep recess
895,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,For once had turn'd a prophetess.
896,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Shuddering Autumn stops to list,"
897,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"And breathes his fear in sudden sighs,"
898,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"With clouded face, and hazel eyes"
899,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"That quench themselves, and hide in mist."
900,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,
901,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Yes, Summer's gone like pageant bright;"
902,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Its glorious days of golden light
903,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Are gone--the mimic suns that quiver,"
904,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Then melt in Time's dark-flowing river.
905,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Gone the sweetly-scented breeze
906,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,That spoke in music to the trees;
907,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Gone--for damp and chilly breath,"
908,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"As if fresh blown o'er marble seas,"
909,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Or newly from the lungs of Death.
910,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Gone its virgin roses' blushes,"
911,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Warm as when Aurora rushes
912,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Freshly from the God's embrace,"
913,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,With all her shame upon her face.
914,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Old Time hath laid them in the mould;
915,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Sure he is blind as well as old,"
916,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Whose hand relentless never spares
917,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Young cheeks so beauty-bright as theirs!
918,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Gone are the flame-eyed lovers now
919,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,From where so blushing-blest they tarried
920,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Under the hawthorn's blossom-bough,"
921,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Gone; for Day and Night are married.
922,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,All the light of love is fled:--
923,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Alas! that negro breasts should hide
924,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"The lips that were so rosy red,"
925,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,At morning and at even-tide!
926,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,
927,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Delightful Summer! then adieu
928,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Till thou shalt visit us anew:
929,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,But who without regretful sigh
930,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Can say, adieu, and see thee fly?"
931,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Not he that e'er hath felt thy pow'r.
932,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"His joy expanding like a flow'r,"
933,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"That cometh after rain and snow,"
934,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Looks up at heaven, and learns to glow:--"
935,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Not he that fled from Babel-strife
936,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"To the green sabbath-land of life,"
937,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"To dodge dull Care 'mid clustered trees,"
938,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"And cool his forehead in the breeze,--"
939,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Whose spirit, weary-worn perchance,"
940,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Shook from its wings a weight of grief,"
941,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"And perch'd upon an aspen leaf,"
942,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,For every breath to make it dance.
943,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,
944,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Farewell!--on wings of sombre stain,"
945,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"That blacken in the last blue skies,"
946,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Thou fly'st; but thou wilt come again
947,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,On the gay wings of butterflies.
948,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Spring at thy approach will sprout
949,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Her new Corinthian beauties out,"
950,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Leaf-woven homes, where twitter-words"
951,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Will grow to songs, and eggs to birds;"
952,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Ambitious buds shall swell to flowers,"
953,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"And April smiles to sunny hours,"
954,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Bright days shall be, and gentle nights"
955,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Full of soft breath and echo-lights,"
956,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,As if the god of sun-time kept
957,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,His eyes half-open while he slept.
958,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Roses shall be where roses were,"
959,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Not shadows, but reality;"
960,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"As if they never perished there,"
961,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,But slept in immortality:
962,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Nature shall thrill with new delight,"
963,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,And Time's relumined river run
964,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Warm as young blood, and dazzling bright,"
965,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,As if its source were in the sun!
966,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,
967,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"But say, hath Winter then no charms?"
968,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Is there no joy, no gladness warms"
969,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,His aged heart? no happy wiles
970,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,To cheat the hoary one to smiles?
971,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Onward he comes--the cruel North
972,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Pours his furious whirlwind forth
973,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Before him--and we breathe the breath
974,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Of famish'd bears that howl to death.
975,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Onward he comes from the rocks that blanch
976,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,O'er solid streams that never flow:
977,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"His tears all ice, his locks all snow,"
978,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Just crept from some huge avalanche--
979,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"A thing half-breathing and half-warm,"
980,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,As if one spark began to glow
981,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Within some statue's marble form,"
982,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Or pilgrim stiffened in the storm.
983,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Oh! will not Mirth's light arrows fail
984,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,To pierce that frozen coat of mail?
985,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Oh! will not joy but strive in vain
986,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,To light up those glazed eyes again?
987,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,
988,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"No! take him in, and blaze the oak,"
989,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"And pour the wine, and warm the ale;"
990,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"His sides shall shake to many a joke,"
991,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"His tongue shall thaw in many a tale,"
992,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"His eyes grow bright, his heart be gay,"
993,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,And even his palsy charm'd away.
994,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,What heeds he then the boisterous shout
995,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Of angry winds that scowl without,"
996,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Like shrewish wives at tavern door?
997,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,What heeds he then the wild uproar
998,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Of billows bursting on the shore?
999,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"In dashing waves, in howling breeze,"
1000,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,There is a music that can charm him;
1001,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"When safe, and sheltered, and at ease,"
1002,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,He hears the storm that cannot harm him.
1003,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,
1004,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,But hark! those shouts! that sudden din
1005,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Of little hearts that laugh within.
1006,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Oh! take him where the youngsters play,"
1007,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,And he will grow as young as they!
1008,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"They come! they come! each blue-eyed Sport,"
1009,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,The Twelfth-Night King and all his court--
1010,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,'Tis Mirth fresh crown'd with misletoe!
1011,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Music with her merry fiddles,"
1012,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Joy ""on light fantastic toe,"""
1013,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Wit with all his jests and riddles,"
1014,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Singing and dancing as they go.
1015,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"And Love, young Love, among the rest,"
1016,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,A welcome--nor unbidden guest.
1017,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,
1018,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,But still for Summer dost thou grieve?
1019,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Then read our Poets--they shall weave
1020,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"A garden of green fancies still,"
1021,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Where thy wish may rove at will.
1022,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,They have kept for after-treats
1023,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"The essences of summer sweets,"
1024,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,And echoes of its songs that wind
1025,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,In endless music through the mind:
1026,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,They have stamp'd in visible traces
1027,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"The ""thoughts that breathe,"" in words that shine--"
1028,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,The flights of soul in sunny places--
1029,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,To greet and company with thine.
1030,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,These shall wing thee on to flow'rs--
1031,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"The past or future, that shall seem"
1032,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,All the brighter in thy dream
1033,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,For blowing in such desert hours.
1034,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,The summer never shines so bright
1035,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,As thought-of in a winter's night;
1036,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,And the sweetest loveliest rose
1037,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Is in the bud before it blows;
1038,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,The dear one of the lover's heart
1039,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Is painted to his longing eyes,"
1040,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,In charms she ne'er can realize--
1041,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,But when she turns again to part.
1042,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Dream thou then, and bind thy brow"
1043,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"With wreath of fancy roses now,"
1044,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,And drink of Summer in the cup
1045,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,Where the Muse hath mix'd it up;
1046,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"The ""dance, and song, and sun-burnt mirth,"""
1047,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,With the warm nectar of the earth:
1048,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,"Drink! 'twill glow in every vein,"
1049,THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER.,And thou shalt dream the winter through:

1084,A FRAGMENT.,"And so they lay in loveliness, and kept"
1085,A FRAGMENT.,"The birth-night of their peace, that Life e'en wept"
1086,A FRAGMENT.,With very envy of their happy fronts;
1087,A FRAGMENT.,For there were neighbor brows scarr'd by the brunts

1089,A FRAGMENT.,"His crooked autograph, and marr'd the jet"
1090,A FRAGMENT.,"Of glassy locks, with hollow eyes forlorn,"
1091,A FRAGMENT.,And lips that curl'd in bitterness and scorn--

1139,THE ARGUMENT.,"Water Nymph, who, desiring to render him immortal, has recourse to"
1140,THE ARGUMENT.,"the Sorceress. Circe gives her an incantation to pronounce, which"
1141,THE ARGUMENT.,should turn Lycus into a horse; but the horrible effect of the
1142,THE ARGUMENT.,"charm causing her to break off in the midst, he becomes a Centaur."
1143,THE ARGUMENT.,
1144,THE ARGUMENT.,
1145,THE ARGUMENT.,Who hath ever been lured and bound by a spell
1146,THE ARGUMENT.,"To wander, fore-doomed, in that circle of hell"
1147,THE ARGUMENT.,"Where Witchery works with her will like a god,"
1148,THE ARGUMENT.,"Works more than the wonders of time at a nod,--"
1149,THE ARGUMENT.,"At a word,--at a touch,--at a flash of the eye,"
1150,THE ARGUMENT.,"But each form is a cheat, and each sound is a lie,"
1151,THE ARGUMENT.,"Things born of a wish--to endure for a thought,"
1152,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or last for long ages--to vanish to nought,"
1153,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or put on new semblance? O Jove, I had given"
1154,THE ARGUMENT.,"The throne of a kingdom to know if that heaven,"
1155,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the earth and its streams were of Circe, or whether"
1156,THE ARGUMENT.,They kept the world's birthday and brighten'd together!
1157,THE ARGUMENT.,"For I loved them in terror, and constantly dreaded"
1158,THE ARGUMENT.,"That the earth where I trod, and the cave where I bedded,"
1159,THE ARGUMENT.,"The face I might dote on, should live out the lease"
1160,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of the charm that created, and suddenly cease:"
1161,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I gave me to slumber, as if from one dream"
1162,THE ARGUMENT.,"To another--each horrid,--and drank of the stream"
1163,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a first taste of blood, lest as water I quaff'd"
1164,THE ARGUMENT.,"Swift poison, and never should breathe from the draught,--"
1165,THE ARGUMENT.,Such drink as her own monarch husband drain'd up
1166,THE ARGUMENT.,"When he pledged her, and Fate closed his eyes in the cup."
1167,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I pluck'd of the fruit with held breath, and a fear"
1168,THE ARGUMENT.,That the branch would start back and scream out in my ear;
1169,THE ARGUMENT.,"For once, at my suppering, I plucked in the dusk"
1170,THE ARGUMENT.,"An apple, juice-gushing and fragrant of musk;"
1171,THE ARGUMENT.,"But by daylight my fingers were crimson'd with gore,"
1172,THE ARGUMENT.,And the half-eaten fragment was flesh at the core;
1173,THE ARGUMENT.,"And once--only once--for the love of its blush,"
1174,THE ARGUMENT.,"I broke a bloom bough, but there came such a gush"
1175,THE ARGUMENT.,"On my hand, that it fainted away in weak fright,"
1176,THE ARGUMENT.,While the leaf-hidden woodpecker shriek'd at the sight;
1177,THE ARGUMENT.,"And oh! such an agony thrill'd in that note,"
1178,THE ARGUMENT.,"That my soul, startling up, beat its wings in my throat,"
1179,THE ARGUMENT.,As it long'd to be free of a body whose hand
1180,THE ARGUMENT.,Was doom'd to work torments a Fury had plann'd!
1181,THE ARGUMENT.,
1182,THE ARGUMENT.,"There I stood without stir, yet how willing to flee,"
1183,THE ARGUMENT.,"As if rooted and horror-turn'd into a tree,--"
1184,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oh! for innocent death,--and to suddenly win it,"
1185,THE ARGUMENT.,"I drank of the stream, but no poison was in it;"
1186,THE ARGUMENT.,"I plunged in its waters, but ere I could sink,"
1187,THE ARGUMENT.,Some invisible fate pull'd me back to the brink;
1188,THE ARGUMENT.,"I sprang from the rock, from its pinnacle height,"
1189,THE ARGUMENT.,But fell on the grass with a grasshopper's flight;
1190,THE ARGUMENT.,"I ran at my fears--they were fears and no more,"
1191,THE ARGUMENT.,"For the bear would not mangle my limbs, nor the boar,"
1192,THE ARGUMENT.,But moan'd--all their brutalized flesh could not smother
1193,THE ARGUMENT.,"The horrible truth,--we were kin to each other!"
1194,THE ARGUMENT.,
1195,THE ARGUMENT.,"They were mournfully gentle, and group'd for relief,"
1196,THE ARGUMENT.,"All foes in their skin, but all friends in their grief:"
1197,THE ARGUMENT.,"The leopard was there,--baby-mild in its feature;"
1198,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the tiger, black-barr'd, with the gaze of a creature"
1199,THE ARGUMENT.,"That knew gentle pity; the bristle-back'd boar,"
1200,THE ARGUMENT.,His innocent tusks stain'd with mulberry gore;
1201,THE ARGUMENT.,And the laughing hyena--but laughing no more;
1202,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the snake, not with magical orbs to devise"
1203,THE ARGUMENT.,"Strange death, but with woman's attraction of eyes;"
1204,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tall ugly ape, that still bore a dim shine"
1205,THE ARGUMENT.,Through his hairy eclipse of a manhood divine;
1206,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the elephant stately, with more than its reason,"
1207,THE ARGUMENT.,How thoughtful in sadness! but this is no season
1208,THE ARGUMENT.,To reckon them up from the lag-bellied toad
1209,THE ARGUMENT.,"To the mammoth, whose sobs shook his ponderous load."
1210,THE ARGUMENT.,"There were woes of all shapes, wretched forms, when I came,"
1211,THE ARGUMENT.,That hung down their heads with a human-like shame;
1212,THE ARGUMENT.,"The elephant hid in the boughs, and the bear"
1213,THE ARGUMENT.,Shed over his eyes the dark veil of his hair;
1214,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the womanly soul turning sick with disgust,"
1215,THE ARGUMENT.,Tried to vomit herself from her serpentine crust;
1216,THE ARGUMENT.,"While all groan'd their groans into one at their lot,"
1217,THE ARGUMENT.,As I brought them the image of what they were not.
1218,THE ARGUMENT.,
1219,THE ARGUMENT.,Then rose a wild sound of the human voice choking
1220,THE ARGUMENT.,Through vile brutal organs--low tremulous croaking:
1221,THE ARGUMENT.,Cries swallow'd abruptly--deep animal tones
1222,THE ARGUMENT.,"Attuned to strange passion, and full-utter'd groans;"
1223,THE ARGUMENT.,"All shuddering weaken, till hush'd in a pause"
1224,THE ARGUMENT.,Of tongues in mute motion and wide-yawning jaws;
1225,THE ARGUMENT.,And I guessed that those horrors were meant to tell o'er
1226,THE ARGUMENT.,"The tale of their woes; but the silence told more,"
1227,THE ARGUMENT.,"That writhed on their tongues; and I knelt on the sod,"
1228,THE ARGUMENT.,"And pray'd with my voice to the cloud-stirring god,"
1229,THE ARGUMENT.,"For the sad congregation of supplicants there,"
1230,THE ARGUMENT.,That upturn'd to his heaven brute faces of prayer;
1231,THE ARGUMENT.,"And I ceased, and they utter'd a moaning so deep,"
1232,THE ARGUMENT.,"That I wept for my heart-ease,--but they could not weep,"
1233,THE ARGUMENT.,"And gazed with red eyeballs, all wistfully dry,"
1234,THE ARGUMENT.,At the comfort of tears in a stag's human eye.
1235,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then I motion'd them round, and, to soothe their distress,"
1236,THE ARGUMENT.,"I caress'd, and they bent them to meet my caress,"
1237,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their necks to my arm, and their heads to my palm,"
1238,THE ARGUMENT.,And with poor grateful eyes suffer'd meekly and calm
1239,THE ARGUMENT.,"Those tokens of kindness, withheld by hard fate"
1240,THE ARGUMENT.,From returns that might chill the warm pity to hate;
1241,THE ARGUMENT.,"So they passively bow'd--save the serpent, that leapt"
1242,THE ARGUMENT.,"To my breast like a sister, and pressingly crept"
1243,THE ARGUMENT.,"In embrace of my neck, and with close kisses blister'd"
1244,THE ARGUMENT.,"My lips in rash love,--then drew backward, and glister'd"
1245,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her eyes in my face, and loud hissing affright,"
1246,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dropt down, but swift started away from my sight!"
1247,THE ARGUMENT.,
1248,THE ARGUMENT.,"This sorrow was theirs, but thrice wretched my lot,"
1249,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turn'd brute in my soul, though my body was not,"
1250,THE ARGUMENT.,"When I fled from the sorrow of womanly faces,"
1251,THE ARGUMENT.,"That shrouded their woe in the shade of lone places,"
1252,THE ARGUMENT.,"And dash'd off bright tears, till their fingers were wet,"
1253,THE ARGUMENT.,And then wiped their lids with long tresses of jet:
1254,THE ARGUMENT.,"But I fled--though they stretch'd out their hands, all entangled"
1255,THE ARGUMENT.,"With hair, and blood-stain'd of the breasts they had mangled,--"
1256,THE ARGUMENT.,"Though they call'd--and perchance but to ask, had I seen"
1257,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their loves, or to tell the vile wrongs that had been:"
1258,THE ARGUMENT.,"But I stayed not to hear, lest the story should hold"
1259,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some hell-form of words, some enchantment, once told,"
1260,THE ARGUMENT.,Might translate me in flesh to a brute; and I dreaded
1261,THE ARGUMENT.,"To gaze on their charms, lest my faith should be wedded"
1262,THE ARGUMENT.,"With some pity,--and love in that pity perchance--"
1263,THE ARGUMENT.,"To a thing not all lovely; for once at glance,"
1264,THE ARGUMENT.,"Methought, where one sat, I descried a bright wonder"
1265,THE ARGUMENT.,That flow'd like a long silver rivulet under
1266,THE ARGUMENT.,"The long fenny grass,--with so lovely a breast,"
1267,THE ARGUMENT.,Could it be a snake-tail made the charm of the rest?
1268,THE ARGUMENT.,
1269,THE ARGUMENT.,"So I roamed in that circle of horrors, and Fear"
1270,THE ARGUMENT.,"Walk'd with me, by hills, and in valleys, and near"
1271,THE ARGUMENT.,Cluster'd trees for their gloom--not to shelter from heat--
1272,THE ARGUMENT.,But lest a brute-shadow should grow at my feet;
1273,THE ARGUMENT.,And besides that full oft in the sunshiny place
1274,THE ARGUMENT.,"Dark shadows would gather like clouds on its face,"
1275,THE ARGUMENT.,In the horrible likeness of demons (that none
1276,THE ARGUMENT.,"Could see, like invisible flames in the sun);"
1277,THE ARGUMENT.,"But grew to one monster that seized on the light,"
1278,THE ARGUMENT.,Like the dragon that strangles the moon in the night;
1279,THE ARGUMENT.,"Fierce sphinxes, long serpents, and asps of the south;"
1280,THE ARGUMENT.,"Wild birds of huge beak, and all horrors that drouth"
1281,THE ARGUMENT.,"Engenders of slime in the land of the pest,"
1282,THE ARGUMENT.,"Vile shapes without shape, and foul bats of the West,"
1283,THE ARGUMENT.,Bringing Night on their wings; and the bodies wherein
1284,THE ARGUMENT.,"Great Brahma imprisons the spirits of sin,"
1285,THE ARGUMENT.,"Many-handed, that blent in one phantom of fight"
1286,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a Titan, and threatfully warr'd with the light;"
1287,THE ARGUMENT.,"I have heard the wild shriek that gave signal to close,"
1288,THE ARGUMENT.,"When they rushed on that shadowy Python of foes,"
1289,THE ARGUMENT.,"That met with sharp beaks and wide gaping of jaws,"
1290,THE ARGUMENT.,"With flappings of wings, and fierce grasping of claws,"
1291,THE ARGUMENT.,And whirls of long tails:--I have seen the quick flutter
1292,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of fragments dissevered,--and necks stretch'd to utter"
1293,THE ARGUMENT.,"Long screamings of pain,--the swift motion of blows,"
1294,THE ARGUMENT.,"And wrestling of arms--to the flight at the close,"
1295,THE ARGUMENT.,"When the dust of the earth startled upward in rings,"
1296,THE ARGUMENT.,And flew on the whirlwind that follow'd their wings.
1297,THE ARGUMENT.,
1298,THE ARGUMENT.,Thus they fled--not forgotten--but often to grow
1299,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like fears in my eyes, when I walk'd to and fro"
1300,THE ARGUMENT.,"In the shadows, and felt from some beings unseen"
1301,THE ARGUMENT.,"The warm touch of kisses, but clean or unclean"
1302,THE ARGUMENT.,"I knew not, nor whether the love I had won"
1303,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was of heaven or hell--till one day in the sun,"
1304,THE ARGUMENT.,"In its very noon-blaze, I could fancy a thing"
1305,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of beauty, but faint as the cloud-mirrors fling"
1306,THE ARGUMENT.,"On the gaze of the shepherd that watches the sky,"
1307,THE ARGUMENT.,Half-seen and half-dream'd in the soul of his eye.
1308,THE ARGUMENT.,"And when in my musings I gazed on the stream,"
1309,THE ARGUMENT.,"In motionless trances of thought, there would seem"
1310,THE ARGUMENT.,"A face like that face, looking upward through mine:"
1311,THE ARGUMENT.,"With his eyes full of love, and the dim-drownd shine"
1312,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of limbs and fair garments, like clouds in that blue"
1313,THE ARGUMENT.,Serene:--there I stood for long hours but to view
1314,THE ARGUMENT.,Those fond earnest eyes that were ever uplifted
1315,THE ARGUMENT.,"Towards me, and wink'd as the water-weed drifted"
1316,THE ARGUMENT.,"Between; but the fish knew that presence, and plied"
1317,THE ARGUMENT.,"Their long curvy tails, and swift darted aside."
1318,THE ARGUMENT.,
1319,THE ARGUMENT.,"There I gazed for lost time, and forgot all the things"
1320,THE ARGUMENT.,"That once had been wonders--the fishes with wings,"
1321,THE ARGUMENT.,And the glimmer of magnified eyes that look'd up
1322,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the glooms of the bottom like pearls in a cup,"
1323,THE ARGUMENT.,"And the huge endless serpent of silvery gleam,"
1324,THE ARGUMENT.,Slow winding along like a tide in the stream.
1325,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some maid of the waters, some Naiad, methought"
1326,THE ARGUMENT.,Held me dear in the pearl of her eye--and I brought
1327,THE ARGUMENT.,My wish to that fancy; and often I dash'd
1328,THE ARGUMENT.,"My limbs in the water, and suddenly splash'd"
1329,THE ARGUMENT.,"The cool drops around me, yet clung to the brink,"
1330,THE ARGUMENT.,"Chill'd by watery fears, how that beauty might sink"
1331,THE ARGUMENT.,"With my life in her arms to her garden, and bind me"
1332,THE ARGUMENT.,"With its long tangled grasses, or cruelly wind me"
1333,THE ARGUMENT.,"In some eddy to hum out my life in her ear,"
1334,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a spider-caught bee,--and in aid of that fear"
1335,THE ARGUMENT.,Came the tardy remembrance--Oh falsest of men!
1336,THE ARGUMENT.,Why was not that beauty remember'd till then?
1337,THE ARGUMENT.,"My love, my safe love, whose glad life would have run"
1338,THE ARGUMENT.,"Into mine--like a drop--that our fate might be one,"
1339,THE ARGUMENT.,"That now, even now,--may-be,--clasp'd in a dream,"
1340,THE ARGUMENT.,"That form which I gave to some jilt of the stream,"
1341,THE ARGUMENT.,And gazed with fond eyes that her tears tried to smother
1342,THE ARGUMENT.,On a mock of those eyes that I gave to another!
1343,THE ARGUMENT.,
1344,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then I rose from the stream, but the eyes of my mind,"
1345,THE ARGUMENT.,"Still full of the tempter, kept gazing behind"
1346,THE ARGUMENT.,"On her crystalline face, while I painfully leapt"
1347,THE ARGUMENT.,"To the bank, and shook off the curst waters, and wept"
1348,THE ARGUMENT.,With my brow in the reeds; and the reeds to my ear
1349,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bow'd, bent by no wind, and in whispers of fear,"
1350,THE ARGUMENT.,"Growing small with large secrets, foretold me of one"
1351,THE ARGUMENT.,"That loved me,--but oh to fly from her, and shun"
1352,THE ARGUMENT.,Her love like a pest--though her love was as true
1353,THE ARGUMENT.,To mine as her stream to the heavenly blue;
1354,THE ARGUMENT.,For why should I love her with love that would bring
1355,THE ARGUMENT.,"All misfortune, like hate, on so joyous a thing?"
1356,THE ARGUMENT.,"Because of her rival,--even Her whose witch-face"
1357,THE ARGUMENT.,"I had slighted, and therefore was doom'd in that place"
1358,THE ARGUMENT.,"To roam, and had roam'd, where all horrors grew rank,"
1359,THE ARGUMENT.,Nine days ere I wept with my brow on that bank;
1360,THE ARGUMENT.,"Her name be not named, but her spite would not fail"
1361,THE ARGUMENT.,To our love like a blight; and they told me the tale
1362,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of Scylla,--and Picus, imprison'd to speak"
1363,THE ARGUMENT.,His shrill-screaming woe through a woodpecker's beak.
1364,THE ARGUMENT.,
1365,THE ARGUMENT.,Then they ceased--I had heard as the voice of my star
1366,THE ARGUMENT.,That told me the truth of my fortunes--thus far
1367,THE ARGUMENT.,"I had read of my sorrow, and lay in the hush"
1368,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of deep meditation,--when lo! a light crush"
1369,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of the reeds, and I turn'd and look'd round in the night"
1370,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of new sunshine, and saw, as I sipp'd of the light"
1371,THE ARGUMENT.,"Narrow-winking, the realized nymph of the stream,"
1372,THE ARGUMENT.,Rising up from the wave with the bend and the gleam
1373,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of a fountain, and o'er her white arms she kept throwing"
1374,THE ARGUMENT.,"Bright torrents of hair, that went flowing and flowing"
1375,THE ARGUMENT.,"In falls to her feet, and the blue waters roll'd"
1376,THE ARGUMENT.,"Down her limbs like a garment, in many a fold,"
1377,THE ARGUMENT.,"Sun-spangled, gold-broider'd, and fled far behind,"
1378,THE ARGUMENT.,Like an infinite train. So she came and reclined
1379,THE ARGUMENT.,"In the reeds, and I hunger'd to see her unseal"
1380,THE ARGUMENT.,The buds of her eyes that would ope and reveal
1381,THE ARGUMENT.,The blue that was in them;--they oped and she raised
1382,THE ARGUMENT.,"Two orbs of pure crystal, and timidly gazed"
1383,THE ARGUMENT.,With her eyes on my eyes; but their color and shine
1384,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was of that which they look'd on, and mostly of mine--"
1385,THE ARGUMENT.,"For she loved me,--except when she blush'd, and they sank,"
1386,THE ARGUMENT.,"Shame-humbled, to number the stones on the bank,"
1387,THE ARGUMENT.,"Or her play-idle fingers, while lisping she told me"
1388,THE ARGUMENT.,"How she put on her veil, and in love to behold me"
1389,THE ARGUMENT.,Would wing through the sun till she fainted away
1390,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a mist, and then flew to her waters and lay"
1391,THE ARGUMENT.,"In love-patience long hours, and sore dazzled her eyes"
1392,THE ARGUMENT.,In watching for mine 'gainst the midsummer skies.
1393,THE ARGUMENT.,"But now they were heal'd,--O my heart, it still dances"
1394,THE ARGUMENT.,"When I think of the charm of her changeable glances,"
1395,THE ARGUMENT.,And my image how small when it sank in the deep
1396,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of her eyes where her soul was,--Alas! now they weep,"
1397,THE ARGUMENT.,And none knoweth where. In what stream do her eyes
1398,THE ARGUMENT.,Shed invisible tears? Who beholds where her sighs
1399,THE ARGUMENT.,"Flow in eddies, or sees the ascent of the leaf"
1400,THE ARGUMENT.,She has pluck'd with her tresses? Who listens her grief
1401,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a far fall of waters, or hears where her feet"
1402,THE ARGUMENT.,"Grow emphatic among the loose pebbles, and beat"
1403,THE ARGUMENT.,Them together? Ah! surely her flowers float adown
1404,THE ARGUMENT.,"To the sea unaccepted, and little ones drown"
1405,THE ARGUMENT.,"For need of her mercy,--even he whose twin-brother"
1406,THE ARGUMENT.,Will miss him forever; and the sorrowful mother
1407,THE ARGUMENT.,Imploreth in vain for his body to kiss
1408,THE ARGUMENT.,"And cling to, all dripping and cold as it is,"
1409,THE ARGUMENT.,Because that soft pity is lost in hard pain
1410,THE ARGUMENT.,"We loved,--how we loved!--for I thought not again"
1411,THE ARGUMENT.,Of the woes that were whisper'd like fears in that place
1412,THE ARGUMENT.,"If I gave me to beauty. Her face was the face,"
1413,THE ARGUMENT.,"Far away, and her eyes were the eyes that were drown'd"
1414,THE ARGUMENT.,"For my absence,--her arms were the arms that sought round"
1415,THE ARGUMENT.,And claspt me to nought; for I gazed and became
1416,THE ARGUMENT.,"Only true to my falsehood, and had but one name"
1417,THE ARGUMENT.,"For two loves, and call'd ever on Ægle, sweet maid"
1418,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of the sky-loving waters,--and was not afraid"
1419,THE ARGUMENT.,Of the sight of her skin;--for it never could be;
1420,THE ARGUMENT.,Her beauty and love were misfortunes to me!
1421,THE ARGUMENT.,
1422,THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus our bliss had endured for a time-shorten'd space,"
1423,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a day made of three, and the smile of her face"
1424,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had been with me for joy,--when she told me indeed"
1425,THE ARGUMENT.,Her love was self-task'd with a work that would need
1426,THE ARGUMENT.,"Some short hours, for in truth 'twas the veriest pity"
1427,THE ARGUMENT.,"Our love should not last, and then sang me a ditty,"
1428,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of one with warm lips that should love her, and love her"
1429,THE ARGUMENT.,When suns were burnt dim and long ages past over.
1430,THE ARGUMENT.,"So she fled with her voice, and I patiently nested"
1431,THE ARGUMENT.,"My limbs in the reeds, in still quiet, and rested"
1432,THE ARGUMENT.,"Till my thoughts grew extinct, and I sank in a sleep"
1433,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of dreams,--but their meaning was hidden too deep"
1434,THE ARGUMENT.,To be read what their woe was;--but still it was woe
1435,THE ARGUMENT.,That was writ on all faces that swam to and fro
1436,THE ARGUMENT.,In that river of night;--and the gaze of their eyes
1437,THE ARGUMENT.,"Was sad,--and the bend of their brows,--and their cries"
1438,THE ARGUMENT.,"Were seen, but I heard not. The warm touch of tears"
1439,THE ARGUMENT.,"Travell'd down my cold cheeks, and I shook till my fears"
1440,THE ARGUMENT.,"Awaked me, and lo! I was couch'd in a bower,"
1441,THE ARGUMENT.,The growth of long summers rear'd up in an hour!
1442,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then I said, in the fear of my dream, I will fly"
1443,THE ARGUMENT.,"From this magic, but could not, because that my eye"
1444,THE ARGUMENT.,Grew love-idle among the rich blooms; and the earth
1445,THE ARGUMENT.,"Held me down with its coolness of touch, and the mirth"
1446,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of some bird was above me,--who, even in fear,"
1447,THE ARGUMENT.,Would startle the thrush? and methought there drew near
1448,THE ARGUMENT.,"A form as of Ægle,--but it was not the face"
1449,THE ARGUMENT.,"Hope made, and I knew the witch-Queen of that place,"
1450,THE ARGUMENT.,"Even Circe the Cruel, that came like a Death,"
1451,THE ARGUMENT.,"Which I fear'd, and yet fled not, for want of my breath."
1452,THE ARGUMENT.,"There was thought in her face, and her eyes were not raised"
1453,THE ARGUMENT.,"From the grass at her foot, but I saw, as I gazed,"
1454,THE ARGUMENT.,Her spite--and her countenance changed with her mind
1455,THE ARGUMENT.,"As she plann'd how to thrall me with beauty, and bind"
1456,THE ARGUMENT.,"My soul to her charms,--and her long tresses play'd"
1457,THE ARGUMENT.,"From shade into shine and from shine into shade,"
1458,THE ARGUMENT.,"Like a day in mid-autumn,--first fair, O how fair!"
1459,THE ARGUMENT.,With long snaky locks of the adder-black hair
1460,THE ARGUMENT.,"That clung round her neck,--those dark locks that I prize,"
1461,THE ARGUMENT.,For the sake of a maid that once loved me with eyes
1462,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of that fathomless hue,--but they changed as they roll'd,"
1463,THE ARGUMENT.,"And brighten'd, and suddenly blazed into gold"
1464,THE ARGUMENT.,"That she comb'd into flames, and the locks that fell down"
1465,THE ARGUMENT.,"Turn'd dark as they fell, but I slighted their brown,"
1466,THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor loved, till I saw the light ringlets shed wild,"
1467,THE ARGUMENT.,That innocence wears when she is but a child;
1468,THE ARGUMENT.,"And her eyes,--Oh I ne'er had been witched with their shine,"
1469,THE ARGUMENT.,"Had they been any other, my Ægle, than thine!"
1470,THE ARGUMENT.,
1471,THE ARGUMENT.,"Then I gave me to magic, and gazed till I madden'd"
1472,THE ARGUMENT.,"In the full of their light,--but I sadden'd and sadden'd"
1473,THE ARGUMENT.,"The deeper I look'd,--till I sank on the snow"
1474,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of her bosom, a thing made of terror and woe,"
1475,THE ARGUMENT.,"And answer'd its throb with the shudder of fears,"
1476,THE ARGUMENT.,"And hid my cold eyes from her eyes with my tears,"
1477,THE ARGUMENT.,And strain'd her white arms with the still languid weight
1478,THE ARGUMENT.,Of a fainting distress. There she sat like the Fate
1479,THE ARGUMENT.,"That is nurse unto Death, and bent over in shame"
1480,THE ARGUMENT.,To hide me from her the true Ægle--that came
1481,THE ARGUMENT.,With the words on her lips the false witch had fore-given
1482,THE ARGUMENT.,To make me immortal--for now I was even
1483,THE ARGUMENT.,"At the portals of Death, who but waited the hush"
1484,THE ARGUMENT.,"Of world-sounds in my ears to cry welcome, and rush"
1485,THE ARGUMENT.,With my soul to the banks of his black-flowing river.
1486,THE ARGUMENT.,"Oh, would it had flown from my body forever,"

7247,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"an accomplice, and with his own hand effected the violent death of"

7259,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],wrought to a confession of their deposit. The learned homicide was
7260,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"seized and arraigned, and a trial of uncommon interest was wound up"
7261,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],by a defence as memorable as the tragedy itself for eloquence and
7262,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"ingenuity--too ingenious for innocence, and eloquent enough to do"
7263,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],credit even to that long premeditation which the interval between
7264,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],the deed and its discovery had afforded. That this dreary period
7265,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],had not passed without paroxysms of remorse may be inferred from a
7266,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],fact of affecting interest. The late Admiral Burney was a scholar
7267,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"at the school at Lynn in Norfolk when Aram was an usher, subsequent"
7268,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"to his crime. The Admiral stated that Aram was beloved by the boys,"
7269,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"and that he used to discourse to them of murder, not occasionally,"
7270,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"as I have written elsewhere, but constantly, and in somewhat of the"

7273,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"""For the more imaginative part of the version I must refer back to"
7274,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],one of those unaccountable visions which come upon us like
7275,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],frightful monsters thrown up by storms from the great black deeps
7276,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"of slumber. A lifeless body, in love and relationship the nearest"
7277,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"and dearest, was imposed upon my back, with an overwhelming sense"
7278,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"of obligation--not of filial piety merely, but some awful"
7279,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"responsibility, equally vague and intense, and involving, as it"
7280,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"seemed, inexpiable sin, horrors unutterable, torments"
7281,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"intolerable--to bury my dead, like Abraham, out of my sight. In"
7282,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"vain I attempted, again and again, to obey the mysterious"

7284,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],"more stupendous weight of injunction, and an apalling conviction of"
7285,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],the impossibility of its fulfilment. My mental anguish was
7286,THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM.[9],indescribable;--the mighty agonies of souls tortured on the

11036,CCXII.,
11037,CCXII.,
11038,CCXIII.,CCXIII.
11039,CCXIII.,
11040,CCXIII.,"Savage at heart, and false of tongue,"
11041,CCXIII.,"Subtle with age, and smooth to the young,"
11042,CCXIII.,Like a snake in his coiling and curling--
11043,CCXIII.,Such was the Count--to give him a niche--
11044,CCXIII.,"Who came to court that Heiress rich,"
11045,CCXIII.,And knelt at her foot--one needn't say which--
11046,CCXIII.,Besieging her castle of _Stirling_.
11047,CCXIII.,
11048,CCXIII.,
11049,CCXIV.,CCXIV.
11050,CCXIV.,
11051,CCXIV.,"With pray'rs and vows he open'd his trench,"
11052,CCXIV.,"And plied her with English, Spanish, and French"
11053,CCXIV.,In phrases the most sentimental:
11054,CCXIV.,"And quoted poems in High and Low Dutch,"
11055,CCXIV.,"With now and then an Italian touch,"
11056,CCXIV.,"Till she yielded, without resisting much,"
11057,CCXIV.,To homage so continental.
11058,CCXIV.,
11059,CCXIV.,
11060,CCXV.,CCXV.
11061,CCXV.,
11062,CCXV.,And then--the sordid bargain to close--
11063,CCXV.,"With a miniature sketch of his hooky nose,"
11064,CCXV.,"And his dear dark eyes, as black as sloes,"
11065,CCXV.,"And his beard and whiskers as black as those,"
11066,CCXV.,The lady's consent he requited--
11067,CCXV.,"And instead of the lock that lovers beg,"
11068,CCXV.,The Count received from Miss Kilmansegg
11069,CCXV.,"A model, in small, of her Precious Leg--"
11070,CCXV.,And so the couple were plighted!
11071,CCXV.,
11072,CCXV.,
11073,CCXVI.,CCXVI.
11074,CCXVI.,
11075,CCXVI.,"But, oh! the love that gold must crown!"
11076,CCXVI.,"Better--better, the love of the clown,"
11077,CCXVI.,"Who admires his lass in her Sunday gown,"
11078,CCXVI.,As if all the fairies had dress'd her!
11079,CCXVI.,"Whose brain to no crooked thought gives birth,"
11080,CCXVI.,Except that he never will part on earth
11081,CCXVI.,With his true love's crooked tester!
11082,CCXVI.,
11083,CCXVI.,
11084,CCXVII.,CCXVII.
11085,CCXVII.,
11086,CCXVII.,Alas! for the love that's link'd with gold!
11087,CCXVII.,Better--better a thousand times told--
11088,CCXVII.,"More honest, happy, and laudable,"
11089,CCXVII.,"The downright loving of pretty Cis,"
11090,CCXVII.,"Who wipes her lips, though there's nothing amiss,"
11091,CCXVII.,"And takes a kiss, and gives a kiss,"
11092,CCXVII.,In which her heart is audible!
11093,CCXVII.,
11094,CCXVII.,
11095,CCXVIII.,CCXVIII.
11096,CCXVIII.,
11097,CCXVIII.,"Pretty Cis, so smiling and bright,"
11098,CCXVIII.,"Who loves--as she labors--with all her might,"
11099,CCXVIII.,And without any sordid leaven!
11100,CCXVIII.,"Who blushes as red as haws and hips,"
11101,CCXVIII.,"Down to her very finger-tips,"
11102,CCXVIII.,"For Roger's blue ribbons--to her, like strips"
11103,CCXVIII.,Cut out of the azure of Heaven!
11104,CCXVIII.,
11105,CCXVIII.,
11106,CCXVIII.,
11107,HER MARRIAGE.,HER MARRIAGE.

11109,HER MARRIAGE.,
11110,CCXIX.,CCXIX.
11111,CCXIX.,
11112,CCXIX.,'Twas morn--a most auspicious one!
11113,CCXIX.,"From the Golden East, the Golden Sun"
11114,CCXIX.,"Came forth his glorious race to run,"
11115,CCXIX.,Through clouds of most splendid tinges;
11116,CCXIX.,"Clouds that lately slept in shade,"
11117,CCXIX.,But now seem'd made
11118,CCXIX.,"Of gold brocade,"
11119,CCXIX.,With magnificent golden fringes.
11120,CCXIX.,
11121,CCXIX.,
11122,CCXX.,CCXX.
11123,CCXX.,
11124,CCXX.,"Gold above, and gold below,"
11125,CCXX.,"The earth reflected the golden glow,"
11126,CCXX.,"From river, and hill, and valley;"
11127,CCXX.,"Gilt by the golden light of morn,"
11128,CCXX.,"The Thames--it look'd like the Golden Horn,"
11129,CCXX.,"And the Barge, that carried coal or corn,"
11130,CCXX.,Like Cleopatra's Galley!
11131,CCXX.,
11132,CCXX.,
11133,CCXXI.,CCXXI.
11134,CCXXI.,
11135,CCXXI.,"Bright as clusters of Golden-rod,"
11136,CCXXI.,"Suburban poplars began to nod,"
11137,CCXXI.,With extempore splendor furnish'd;
11138,CCXXI.,"While London was bright with glittering clocks,"
11139,CCXXI.,"Golden dragons, and Golden cocks,"
11140,CCXXI.,"And above them all,"
11141,CCXXI.,"The dome of St. Paul,"
11142,CCXXI.,"With its Golden Cross and its Golden Ball,"
11143,CCXXI.,Shone out as if newly burnished!
11144,CCXXI.,
11145,CCXXI.,
11146,CCXXII.,CCXXII.
11147,CCXXII.,
11148,CCXXII.,"And lo! for Golden Hours and Joys,"
11149,CCXXII.,Troops of glittering Golden Boys
11150,CCXXII.,"Danced along with a jocund noise,"
11151,CCXXII.,And their gilded emblems carried!
11152,CCXXII.,"In short, 'twas the year's most Golden Day,"
11153,CCXXII.,"By mortals call'd the First of May,"
11154,CCXXII.,"When Miss Kilmansegg,"
11155,CCXXII.,"Of the Golden Leg,"
11156,CCXXII.,With a Golden Ring was married!
11157,CCXXII.,
11158,CCXXII.,
11159,CCXXIII.,CCXXIII.
11160,CCXXIII.,
11161,CCXXIII.,"And thousands of children, women, and men,"
11162,CCXXIII.,"Counted the clock from eight till ten,"
11163,CCXXIII.,From St. James's sonorous steeple;
11164,CCXXIII.,"For next to that interesting job,"
11165,CCXXIII.,"The hanging of Jack, or Bill, or Bob,"
11166,CCXXIII.,There's nothing so draws a London mob
11167,CCXXIII.,As the noosing of very rich people.
11168,CCXXIII.,
11169,CCXXIII.,
11170,CCXXIV.,CCXXIV.
11171,CCXXIV.,
11172,CCXXIV.,And a treat it was for the mob to behold
11173,CCXXIV.,The Bridal Carriage that blazed with gold!
11174,CCXXIV.,"And the Footmen tall and the Coachman bold,"
11175,CCXXIV.,In liveries so resplendent--
11176,CCXXIV.,"Coats you wonder'd to see in place,"
11177,CCXXIV.,"They seem'd so rich with golden lace,"
11178,CCXXIV.,That they might have been independent.
11179,CCXXIV.,
11180,CCXXIV.,
11181,CCXXV.,CCXXV.
11182,CCXXV.,
11183,CCXXV.,"Coats, that made those menials proud"
11184,CCXXV.,"Gaze with scorn on the dingy crowd,"
11185,CCXXV.,From their gilded elevations;
11186,CCXXV.,Not to forget that saucy lad
11187,CCXXV.,(Ostentation's favorite cad);
11188,CCXXV.,"The Page, who look'd, so splendidly clad,"
11189,CCXXV.,"Like a Page of the ""Wealth of Nations."""
11190,CCXXV.,
11191,CCXXV.,
11192,CCXXVI.,CCXXVI.
11193,CCXXVI.,
11194,CCXXVI.,"But the Coachman carried off the state,"
11195,CCXXVI.,With what was a Lancashire body of late
11196,CCXXVI.,Turn'd into a Dresden Figure;
11197,CCXXVI.,"With a bridal Nosegay of early bloom,"
11198,CCXXVI.,"About the size of a birchen broom,"
11199,CCXXVI.,"And so huge a White Favor, had Gog been Groom"
11200,CCXXVI.,He need not have worn a bigger.
11201,CCXXVI.,
11202,CCXXVI.,
11203,CCXXVII.,CCXXVII.
11204,CCXXVII.,
11205,CCXXVII.,And then to see the Groom! the Count
11206,CCXXVII.,"With Foreign Orders to such an amount,"
11207,CCXXVII.,"And whiskers so wild--nay, bestial;"
11208,CCXXVII.,He seem'd to have borrow'd the shaggy hair
11209,CCXXVII.,"As well as the Stars of the Polar Bear,"
11210,CCXXVII.,To make him look celestial!
11211,CCXXVII.,
11212,CCXXVII.,
11213,CCXXVIII.,CCXXVIII.
11214,CCXXVIII.,
11215,CCXXVIII.,"And then--Great Jove!--the struggle, the crush,"
11216,CCXXVIII.,"The screams, the heaving, the awful rush,"
11217,CCXXVIII.,"The swearing, the tearing, and fighting,--"
11218,CCXXVIII.,The hats and bonnets smash'd like an egg--
11219,CCXXVIII.,"To catch a glimpse of the Golden Leg,"
11220,CCXXVIII.,"Which, between the steps and Miss Kilmansegg,"
11221,CCXXVIII.,Was fully display'd in alighting!
11222,CCXXVIII.,
11223,CCXXVIII.,
11224,CCXXIX.,CCXXIX.
11225,CCXXIX.,
11226,CCXXIX.,From the Golden Ankle up to the Knee
11227,CCXXIX.,There it was for the mob to see!
11228,CCXXIX.,A shocking act had it chanced to be
11229,CCXXIX.,A crooked leg or a skinny:
11230,CCXXIX.,But although a magnificent veil she wore.
11231,CCXXIX.,"Such as never was seen before,"
11232,CCXXIX.,"In case of blushes, she blush'd no more"
11233,CCXXIX.,Than George the First on a guinea!
11234,CCXXIX.,
11235,CCXXIX.,
11236,CCXXX.,CCXXX.
11237,CCXXX.,
11238,CCXXX.,"Another step, and lo! she was launched!"
11239,CCXXX.,"All in white, as Brides are _blanched_,"
11240,CCXXX.,With a wreath of most wonderful splendor--
11241,CCXXX.,"Diamonds, and pearls, so rich in device,"
11242,CCXXX.,"That, according to calculation nice,"
11243,CCXXX.,Her head was worth as royal a price
11244,CCXXX.,As the head of the Young Pretender.
11245,CCXXX.,
11246,CCXXX.,
11247,CCXXXI.,CCXXXI.
11248,CCXXXI.,
11249,CCXXXI.,Bravely she shone--and shone the more
11250,CCXXXI.,"As she sail'd through the crowd of squalid and poor,"
11251,CCXXXI.,"Thief, beggar, and tatterdemalion--"
11252,CCXXXI.,"Led by the Count, with his sloe-black eyes"
11253,CCXXXI.,"Bright with triumph, and some surprise,"
11254,CCXXXI.,Like Anson on making sure of his prize
11255,CCXXXI.,The famous Mexican Galleon!
11256,CCXXXI.,
11257,CCXXXI.,
11258,CCXXXII.,CCXXXII.
11259,CCXXXII.,
11260,CCXXXII.,"Anon came Lady K., with her face"
11261,CCXXXII.,"Quite made up to act with grace,"
11262,CCXXXII.,But she cut the performance shorter;
11263,CCXXXII.,"For instead of pacing stately and stiff,"
11264,CCXXXII.,"At the stare of the vulgar she took a miff,"
11265,CCXXXII.,"And ran, full speed, into Church, as if"
11266,CCXXXII.,To get married before her daughter.
11267,CCXXXII.,
11268,CCXXXII.,
11269,CCXXXIII.,CCXXXIII.
11270,CCXXXIII.,
11271,CCXXXIII.,"But Sir Jacob walk'd more slowly, and bow'd"
11272,CCXXXIII.,"Eight and left to the gaping crowd,"
11273,CCXXXIII.,Wherever a glance was seizable;
11274,CCXXXIII.,"For Sir Jacob thought he bow'd like a Guelph,"
11275,CCXXXIII.,"And therefore bow'd to imp and elf,"
11276,CCXXXIII.,"And would gladly have made a bow to himself,"
11277,CCXXXIII.,Had such a bow been feasible.
11278,CCXXXIII.,
11279,CCXXXIII.,
11280,CCXXXIV.,CCXXXIV.
11281,CCXXXIV.,
11282,CCXXXIV.,"And last--and not the least of the sight,"
11283,CCXXXIV.,"Six ""Handsome Fortunes,"" all in white,"
11284,CCXXXIV.,"Came to help in the marriage rite,--"
11285,CCXXXIV.,And rehearse their own hymeneals;
11286,CCXXXIV.,"And then the bright procession to close,"
11287,CCXXXIV.,They were followed by just as many Beaux
11288,CCXXXIV.,Quite fine enough for Ideals.
11289,CCXXXIV.,
11290,CCXXXIV.,
11291,CCXXXV.,CCXXXV.
11292,CCXXXV.,
11293,CCXXXV.,"Glittering men, and splendid dames,"
11294,CCXXXV.,"Thus they enter'd the porch of Saint James',"
11295,CCXXXV.,Pursued by a thunder of laughter;
11296,CCXXXV.,"For the Beadle was forced to intervene,"
11297,CCXXXV.,"For Jim the Crow, and his Mayday Queen,"
11298,CCXXXV.,"With her gilded ladle, and Jack i' the Green,"
11299,CCXXXV.,Would fain have follow'd after!
11300,CCXXXV.,
11301,CCXXXV.,
11302,CCXXXVI.,CCXXXVI.
11303,CCXXXVI.,
11304,CCXXXVI.,Beadle-like he hush'd the shouts;
11305,CCXXXVI.,"But the temple was full ""inside and out,"""
11306,CCXXXVI.,And a buzz kept buzzing all round about
11307,CCXXXVI.,Like bees when the day is sunny--
11308,CCXXXVI.,A buzz universal that interfered
11309,CCXXXVI.,"With the right that ought to have been revered,"
11310,CCXXXVI.,As if the couple already were smear'd
11311,CCXXXVI.,With Wedlock's treacle and honey!
11312,CCXXXVI.,
11313,CCXXXVI.,
11314,CCXXXVII.,CCXXXVII.
11315,CCXXXVII.,
11316,CCXXXVII.,Yet Wedlock's a very awful thing!
11317,CCXXXVII.,"'Tis something like that feat in the ring,"
11318,CCXXXVII.,Which requires good nerve to do it--
11319,CCXXXVII.,"When one of a ""Grand Equestrian Troop"""
11320,CCXXXVII.,"Makes a jump at a gilded hoop,"
11321,CCXXXVII.,Not certain at all
11322,CCXXXVII.,Of what may befall
11323,CCXXXVII.,After his getting through it!

11325,CCXXXVII.,
11326,CCCXXXVIII.,CCCXXXVIII.
11327,CCCXXXVIII.,
11328,CCCXXXVIII.,But the Count he felt the nervous work
11329,CCCXXXVIII.,"No more than any polygamous Turk,"
11330,CCCXXXVIII.,"Or bold piratical skipper,"
11331,CCCXXXVIII.,"Who, during his buccaneering search,"
11332,CCCXXXVIII.,Would as soon engage a hand in church
11333,CCCXXXVIII.,As a hand on board his clipper!

11335,CCCXXXVIII.,
11336,CCXXXIX.,CCXXXIX.
11337,CCXXXIX.,
11338,CCXXXIX.,And how did the Bride perform her part?
11339,CCXXXIX.,Like any bride who is cold at heart.
11340,CCXXXIX.,Mere snow with the ice's glitter;
11341,CCXXXIX.,What but a life of winter for her!
11342,CCXXXIX.,"Bright but chilly, alive without stir,"
11343,CCXXXIX.,"So splendidly comfortless,--just like a Fir"
11344,CCXXXIX.,When the frost is severe and bitter.
11345,CCXXXIX.,
11346,CCXXXIX.,
11347,CCXL.,CCXL.
11348,CCXL.,
11349,CCXL.,Such were the future man and wife!
11350,CCXL.,Whose bale or bliss to the end of life
11351,CCXL.,A few short words were to settle--
11352,CCXL.,"""Wilt thou have this woman?"""
11353,CCXL.,"""I will""--and then,"
11354,CCXL.,"""Wilt thou have this man?"""
11355,CCXL.,"""I will,"" and ""Amen""--"
11356,CCXL.,"And those Two were one Flesh, in the Angels' ken,"

11359,CCXL.,
11360,CCXLI.,CCXLI.
11361,CCXLI.,
11362,CCXLI.,Then the names were sign'd--and kiss'd the kiss:
11363,CCXLI.,"And the Bride, who came from her coach a Miss,"
11364,CCXLI.,As a Countess walk'd to her carriage--
11365,CCXLI.,"Whilst Hymen preen'd his plumes like a dove,"
11366,CCXLI.,"And Cupid flutter'd his wings above,"
11367,CCXLI.,In the shape of a fly--as little a Love
11368,CCXLI.,As ever look'd in at a marriage!
11369,CCXLI.,
11370,CCXLI.,
11371,CCXLII.,CCXLII.
11372,CCXLII.,
11373,CCXLII.,"Another crash--and away they dash'd,"
11374,CCXLII.,And the gilded carriage and footmen flash'd
11375,CCXLII.,From the eyes of the gaping people--
11376,CCXLII.,Who turn'd to gaze at the toe-and-heel
11377,CCXLII.,"Of the Golden Boys beginning a reel,"
11378,CCXLII.,To the merry sound of a wedding peal
11379,CCXLII.,From St. James's musical steeple.

11381,CCXLII.,
11382,CCXLIII.,CCXLIII.
11383,CCXLIII.,
11384,CCXLIII.,Those wedding bells! those wedding bells!
11385,CCXLIII.,How sweetly they sound in pastoral dells
11386,CCXLIII.,From a tow'r in an ivy-green jacket!
11387,CCXLIII.,But town-made joys how dearly they cost;
11388,CCXLIII.,"And after all are tumbled and tost,"
11389,CCXLIII.,"Like a peal from a London steeple, and lost"
11390,CCXLIII.,In town-made riot and racket.

11395,CCXLIV.,"The wedding peal, how sweetly it peals"
11396,CCXLIV.,"With grass or heather beneath our heels,--"

11398,CCXLIV.,"But a London peal, well mingled, be sure,"
11399,CCXLIV.,"With vulgar noises and voices impure,--"
11400,CCXLIV.,With a harsh and discordant overture
11401,CCXLIV.,To the Harmony meant to come after!

11405,CCXLV.,
11406,CCXLV.,"But hence with Discord--perchance, too soon"

11408,CCXLV.,With a dismal occultation!--
11409,CCXLV.,"Whatever Fate's concerted trick,"
11410,CCXLV.,"The Countess and Count, at the present nick,"
11411,CCXLV.,"Have a chicken, and not a crow, to pick"

11420,CCXLVI.,"Broke her fast with ale and beef,"
11421,CCXLVI.,"Instead of toast and the Chinese leaf,"
11422,CCXLVI.,And--in lieu of anchovy--grampus.

11429,CCXLVII.,With wines the most rare and curious--
11430,CCXLVII.,"Wines, of the richest flavor and hue;"
11431,CCXLVII.,With fruits from the worlds both Old and New;
11432,CCXLVII.,And fruits obtain'd before they were due

11440,CCXLVIII.,And prefer all precocious savor:
11441,CCXLVIII.,"For instance, early green peas, of the sort"

11451,CCXLIX.,"Men, whom their fathers had help'd to gild:"
11452,CCXLIX.,"And men, who had had their fortunes to build"

12748,PART II.,His lusty knocks
12749,PART II.,Re-echo many a rood.
12750,PART II.,
12751,PART II.,"His axe is keen, his arm is strong;"
12752,PART II.,The muscles serve him well;
12753,PART II.,"His years have reach'd an extra span,"
12754,PART II.,The number none can tell;
12755,PART II.,But still his lifelong task has been
12756,PART II.,The Timber Tree to fell.
12757,PART II.,
12758,PART II.,"Through Summer's parching sultriness,"
12759,PART II.,"And Winter's freezing cold,"
12760,PART II.,From sapling youth
12761,PART II.,To virile growth.
12762,PART II.,"And Age's rigid mould,"
12763,PART II.,His energetic axe hath rung
12764,PART II.,Within that Forest old.
12765,PART II.,
12766,PART II.,"Aloft, upon his poising steel"
12767,PART II.,The vivid sunbeams glance--
12768,PART II.,About his head and round his feet
12769,PART II.,The forest shadows dance;
12770,PART II.,And bounding from his russet coat
12771,PART II.,The acorn drops askance.
12772,PART II.,
12773,PART II.,"His face is like a Druid's face,"
12774,PART II.,"With wrinkles furrow'd deep,"
12775,PART II.,And tann'd by scorching suns as brown
12776,PART II.,As corn that's ripe to reap;
12777,PART II.,"But the hair on brow, and cheek, and chin,"
12778,PART II.,Is white as wool of sheep.
12779,PART II.,
12780,PART II.,His frame is like a giant's frame;
12781,PART II.,His legs are long and stark;
12782,PART II.,His arms like limbs of knotted yew;
12783,PART II.,His hands like rugged bark;
12784,PART II.,So he felleth still
12785,PART II.,"With right good will,"
12786,PART II.,As if to build an Ark!
12787,PART II.,
12788,PART II.,Oh! well within _His_ fatal path
12789,PART II.,The fearful Tree might quake
12790,PART II.,"Through every fibre, twig, and leaf,"
12791,PART II.,With aspen tremor shake;
12792,PART II.,"Through trunk and root,"
12793,PART II.,"And branch and shoot,"
12794,PART II.,A low complaining make!
12795,PART II.,
12796,PART II.,Oh! well to _Him_ the Tree might breathe
12797,PART II.,"A sad and solemn sound,"
12798,PART II.,"A sigh that murmur'd overhead,"
12799,PART II.,And groans from underground;
12800,PART II.,As in that shady Avenue
12801,PART II.,Where lofty Elms abound!
12802,PART II.,
12803,PART II.,"But calm and mute the Maple stands,"
12804,PART II.,"The Plane, the Ash, the Fir,"
12805,PART II.,"The Elm, the Beech, the drooping Birch,"
12806,PART II.,Without the least demur;
12807,PART II.,And e'en the Aspen's hoary leaf
12808,PART II.,Makes no unusual stir.
12809,PART II.,
12810,PART II.,"The Pines--those old gigantic Pines,"
12811,PART II.,That writhe--recalling soon
12812,PART II.,The famous Human Group that writhes
12813,PART II.,With Snakes in wild festoon--
12814,PART II.,In ramous wrestlings interlaced
12815,PART II.,A Forest Laocoon--
12816,PART II.,
12817,PART II.,Like Titans of primeval girth
12818,PART II.,"By tortures overcome,"
12819,PART II.,"Their brown enormous limbs they twine,"
12820,PART II.,Bedew'd with tears of gum--
12821,PART II.,"Fierce agonies that ought to yell,"
12822,PART II.,"But, like the marble, dumb."
12823,PART II.,
12824,PART II.,"Nay, yonder blasted Elm that stands"
12825,PART II.,"So like a man of sin,"
12826,PART II.,"Who, frantic, flings his arms abroad"
12827,PART II.,To feel the Worm within--
12828,PART II.,"For all that gesture, so intense,"
12829,PART II.,It makes no sort of din!
12830,PART II.,
12831,PART II.,An universal silence reigns
12832,PART II.,"In rugged bark or peel,"
12833,PART II.,Except that very trunk which rings
12834,PART II.,Beneath the biting steel--
12835,PART II.,Meanwhile the Woodman plies his axe
12836,PART II.,With unrelenting zeal!
12837,PART II.,
12838,PART II.,"No rustic song is on his tongue,"
12839,PART II.,No whistle on his lips;
12840,PART II.,But with a quiet thoughtfulness
12841,PART II.,"His trusty tool he grips,"
12842,PART II.,"And, stroke on stroke, keeps hacking out"
12843,PART II.,The bright and flying chips.
12844,PART II.,
12845,PART II.,"Stroke after stroke, with frequent dint"
12846,PART II.,He spreads the fatal gash;
12847,PART II.,"Till, lo! the remnant fibres rend,"
12848,PART II.,"With harsh and sudden crash,"
12849,PART II.,And on the dull resounding turf
12850,PART II.,The jarring branches lash!
12851,PART II.,
12852,PART II.,"Oh! now the Forest Trees may sigh,"
12853,PART II.,"The Ash, the Poplar tall,"
12854,PART II.,"The Elm, the Beech, the drooping Birch,"
12855,PART II.,"The Aspens--one and all,"
12856,PART II.,With solemn groan
12857,PART II.,And hollow moan
12858,PART II.,Lament a comrade's fall!
12859,PART II.,
12860,PART II.,"A goodly Elm, of noble girth,"
12861,PART II.,"That, thrice the human span--"
12862,PART II.,While on their variegated course
12863,PART II.,The constant Seasons ran--
12864,PART II.,"Through gale, and hail, and fiery bolt,"
12865,PART II.,Had stood erect as Man.
12866,PART II.,
12867,PART II.,"But now, like mortal Man himself,"
12868,PART II.,"Struck down by hand of God,"
12869,PART II.,Or heathen Idol tumbled prone
12870,PART II.,"Beneath th' Eternal's nod,"
12871,PART II.,In all its giant bulk and length
12872,PART II.,It lies along the sod!
12873,PART II.,
12874,PART II.,"Ay, now the Forest Trees may grieve"
12875,PART II.,And make a common moan
12876,PART II.,Around that patriarchal trunk
12877,PART II.,So newly overthrown;
12878,PART II.,And with a murmur recognize
12879,PART II.,A doom to be their own!
12880,PART II.,
12881,PART II.,"The Echo sleeps: the idle axe,"
12882,PART II.,"A disregarded tool,"
12883,PART II.,Lies crushing with its passive weight
12884,PART II.,The toad's reputed stool--
12885,PART II.,The Woodman wipes his dewy brow
12886,PART II.,Within the shadows cool.
12887,PART II.,
12888,PART II.,No Zephyr stirs: the ear may catch
12889,PART II.,The smallest insect-hum;
12890,PART II.,But on the disappointed sense
12891,PART II.,No mystic whispers come;
12892,PART II.,"No tone of sylvan sympathy,"
12893,PART II.,The Forest Trees are dumb.
12894,PART II.,
12895,PART II.,"No leafy noise, nor inward voice,"
12896,PART II.,"No sad and solemn sound,"
12897,PART II.,"That sometimes murmurs overhead,"
12898,PART II.,And sometimes underground;
12899,PART II.,"As in that shady Avenue,"
12900,PART II.,Where lofty Elms abound!
12901,PART II.,
12902,PART II.,
12903,PART III.,PART III.
12904,PART III.,
12905,PART III.,The deed is done: the Tree is low
12906,PART III.,That stood so long and firm;
12907,PART III.,"The Woodman and his axe are gone,"
12908,PART III.,His toil has found its term;
12909,PART III.,And where he wrought the speckled Thrush
12910,PART III.,Securely hunts the worm.
12911,PART III.,
12912,PART III.,The Cony from the sandy bank
12913,PART III.,"Has run a rapid race,"
12914,PART III.,"Through thistle, bent, and tangled fern,"
12915,PART III.,To seek the open space;
12916,PART III.,And on its haunches sits erect
12917,PART III.,To clean its furry face.
12918,PART III.,
12919,PART III.,"The dappled Fawn is close at hand,"
12920,PART III.,"The Hind is browsing near,--"
12921,PART III.,And on the Larch's lowest bough
12922,PART III.,The Ousel whistles clear;
12923,PART III.,But checks the note
12924,PART III.,"Within its throat,"
12925,PART III.,As choked with sudden fear!
12926,PART III.,
12927,PART III.,With sudden fear her wormy quest
12928,PART III.,The Thrush abruptly quits--
12929,PART III.,"Through thistle, bent, and tangled fern"
12930,PART III.,The startled Cony flits;
12931,PART III.,And on the Larch's lowest bough
12932,PART III.,No more the Ousel sits.
12933,PART III.,
12934,PART III.,With sudden fear
12935,PART III.,The dappled Deer
12936,PART III.,Effect a swift escape;
12937,PART III.,"But well might bolder creatures start,"
12938,PART III.,"And fly, or stand agape,"
12939,PART III.,"With rising hair, and curdled blood,"
12940,PART III.,To see so grim a Shape!
12941,PART III.,
12942,PART III.,The very sky turns pale above;
12943,PART III.,The earth grows dark beneath;
12944,PART III.,The human Terror thrills with cold
12945,PART III.,And draws a shorter breath--
12946,PART III.,An universal panic owns
12947,PART III.,The dread approach of DEATH!
12948,PART III.,
12949,PART III.,"With silent pace, as shadows come,"
12950,PART III.,"And dark as shadows be,"
12951,PART III.,The grisly Phantom takes his stand
12952,PART III.,"Beside the fallen Tree,"
12953,PART III.,"And scans it with his gloomy eyes,"
12954,PART III.,And laughs with horrid glee--
12955,PART III.,
12956,PART III.,"A dreary laugh and desolate,"
12957,PART III.,"Where mirth is void and null,"
12958,PART III.,As hollow as its echo sounds

12962,PART III.,

13580,PART II.,So ague-like a shiver.
13581,PART II.,
13582,PART II.,"For over all there hung a cloud of fear,"
13583,PART II.,"A sense of mystery the spirit daunted,"
13584,PART II.,"And said, as plain as whisper in the ear,"
13585,PART II.,The place is Haunted!
13586,PART II.,
13587,PART II.,"If but a rat had lingered in the house,"
13588,PART II.,To lure the thought into a social channel!
13589,PART II.,"But not a rat remain'd, or tiny mouse,"
13590,PART II.,To squeak behind the panel.
13591,PART II.,
13592,PART II.,"Huge drops roll'd down the walls, as if they wept;"
13593,PART II.,And where the cricket used to chirp so shrilly
13594,PART II.,"The toad was squatting, and the lizard crept"
13595,PART II.,On that damp hearth and chilly.
13596,PART II.,
13597,PART II.,"For years no cheerful blaze had sparkled there,"
13598,PART II.,Or glanced on coat of buff or knightly metal;
13599,PART II.,"The slug was crawling on the vacant chair,--"
13600,PART II.,The snail upon the settle.
13601,PART II.,
13602,PART II.,"The floor was redolent of mould and must,"
13603,PART II.,The fungus in the rotten seams had quicken'd;
13604,PART II.,While on the oaken table coats of dust
13605,PART II.,Perennially had thicken'd.
13606,PART II.,
13607,PART II.,"No mark of leathern jack or metal can,"
13608,PART II.,"No cup--no horn--no hospitable token,--"
13609,PART II.,All social ties between that board and Man
13610,PART II.,Had long ago been broken.
13611,PART II.,
13612,PART II.,"There was so foul a rumor in the air,"
13613,PART II.,The shadow of a Presence so atrocious;
13614,PART II.,"No human creature could have feasted there,"
13615,PART II.,Even the most ferocious.
13616,PART II.,
13617,PART II.,"For over all there hung a cloud of fear,"
13618,PART II.,"A sense of mystery the spirit daunted,"
13619,PART II.,"And said, as plain as whisper in the ear,"

13624,PART III.,
13625,PART III.,"'Tis hard for human actions to account,"
13626,PART III.,Whether from reason or from impulse only--
13627,PART III.,But some internal prompting bade me mount
13628,PART III.,The gloomy stairs and lonely.
13629,PART III.,
13630,PART III.,"Those gloomy stairs, so dark, and damp, and cold,"
13631,PART III.,"With odors as from bones and relics carnal,"
13632,PART III.,"Deprived of rite, and consecrated mould,"
13633,PART III.,"The chapel vault, or charnel."
13634,PART III.,
13635,PART III.,"Those dreary stairs, where with the sounding stress"
13636,PART III.,"Of ev'ry step so many echoes blended,"
13637,PART III.,"The mind, with dark misgivings, fear'd to guess"
13638,PART III.,How many feet ascended.
13639,PART III.,
13640,PART III.,"The tempest with its spoils had drifted in,"
13641,PART III.,"Till each unwholesome stone was darkly spotted,"
13642,PART III.,"As thickly as the leopard's dappled skin,"
13643,PART III.,With leaves that rankly rotted.
13644,PART III.,
13645,PART III.,The air was thick--and in the upper gloom
13646,PART III.,The bat--or something in its shape--was winging;
13647,PART III.,"And on the wall, as chilly as a tomb,"
13648,PART III.,The Death's-Head moth was clinging.
13649,PART III.,
13650,PART III.,"That mystic moth, which, with a sense profound"
13651,PART III.,"Of all unholy presence, augurs truly;"
13652,PART III.,And with a grim significance flits round
13653,PART III.,The taper burning bluely.
13654,PART III.,
13655,PART III.,"Such omens in the place there seem'd to be,"
13656,PART III.,"At ev'ry crooked turn, or on the landing,"
13657,PART III.,The straining eyeball was prepared to see
13658,PART III.,Some Apparition standing.
13659,PART III.,
13660,PART III.,"For over all there hung a cloud of fear,"
13661,PART III.,"A sense of mystery the spirit daunted,"
13662,PART III.,"And said, as plain as whisper in the ear,"
13663,PART III.,The place is Haunted!
13664,PART III.,
13665,PART III.,Yet no portentous Shape the sight amazed;
13666,PART III.,"Each object plain, and tangible, and valid;"
13667,PART III.,"But from their tarnish'd frames dark Figures gazed,"
13668,PART III.,And Faces spectre-pallid.
13669,PART III.,
13670,PART III.,Not merely with the mimic life that lies
13671,PART III.,Within the compass of Art's simulation;
13672,PART III.,Their souls were looking thro' their painted eyes
13673,PART III.,With awful speculation.
13674,PART III.,
13675,PART III.,On ev'ry lip a speechless horror dwelt;
13676,PART III.,On ev'ry brow the burthen of affliction;
13677,PART III.,The old Ancestral Spirits knew and felt
13678,PART III.,The House's malediction.
13679,PART III.,
13680,PART III.,"Such earnest woe their features overcast,"
13681,PART III.,"They might have stirr'd, or sigh'd, or wept, or spoken;"
13682,PART III.,"But, save the hollow moaning of the blast,"
13683,PART III.,The stillness was unbroken.
13684,PART III.,
13685,PART III.,"No other sound or stir of life was there,"
13686,PART III.,"Except my steps in solitary clamber,"
13687,PART III.,"From flight to flight, from humid stair to stair,"
13688,PART III.,From chamber into chamber.
13689,PART III.,
13690,PART III.,"Deserted rooms of luxury and state,"
13691,PART III.,That old magnificence had richly furnish'd
13692,PART III.,"With pictures, cabinets of ancient date,"
13693,PART III.,And carvings gilt and burnish'd.
13694,PART III.,
13695,PART III.,"Rich hangings, storied by the needle's art"
13696,PART III.,"With scripture history, or classic fable;"
13697,PART III.,"But all had faded, save one ragged part,"
13698,PART III.,Where Cain was slaying Abel.
13699,PART III.,
13700,PART III.,The silent waste of mildew and the moth
13701,PART III.,Had marr'd the tissue with a partial ravage;
13702,PART III.,But undecaying frown'd upon the cloth
13703,PART III.,Each feature stern and savage.
13704,PART III.,
13705,PART III.,The sky was pale; the cloud a thing of doubt;
13706,PART III.,"Some hues were fresh, and some decay'd and duller;"
13707,PART III.,But still the BLOODY HAND shone strangely out
13708,PART III.,With vehemence of color!
13709,PART III.,
13710,PART III.,The BLOODY HAND that with a lurid stain
13711,PART III.,"Shone on the dusty floor, a dismal token,"
13712,PART III.,"Projected from the casement's painted pane,"
13713,PART III.,Where all beside was broken.
13714,PART III.,
13715,PART III.,"The BLOODY HAND significant of crime,"
13716,PART III.,"That glaring on the old heraldic banner,"
13717,PART III.,"Had kept its crimson unimpair'd by time,"
13718,PART III.,In such a wondrous manner!
13719,PART III.,
13720,PART III.,"O'er all there hung the shadow of a fear,"
13721,PART III.,"A sense of mystery the spirit daunted,"
13722,PART III.,"And said, as plain as whisper in the ear,"
13723,PART III.,The place is Haunted!
13724,PART III.,
13725,PART III.,"The Death Watch tick'd behind the panel'd oak,"
13726,PART III.,"Inexplicable tremors shook the arras,"
13727,PART III.,"And echoes strange and mystical awoke,"
13728,PART III.,The fancy to embarrass.
13729,PART III.,
13730,PART III.,"Prophetic hints that filled the soul with dread,"
13731,PART III.,"But thro' one gloomy entrance pointing mostly,"
13732,PART III.,"The while some secret inspiration said,"
13733,PART III.,That Chamber is the Ghostly!
13734,PART III.,
13735,PART III.,Across the door no gossamer festoon
13736,PART III.,"Swung pendulous--no web--no dusty fringes,"
13737,PART III.,No silky chrysalis or white cocoon
13738,PART III.,About its nooks and hinges.
13739,PART III.,
13740,PART III.,"The spider shunn'd the interdicted room,"
13741,PART III.,"The moth, the beetle, and the fly were banish'd,"
13742,PART III.,And where the sunbeam fell athwart the gloom
13743,PART III.,The very midge had vanish'd.
13744,PART III.,
13745,PART III.,"One lonely ray that glanced upon a Bed,"
13746,PART III.,As if with awful aim direct and certain
13747,PART III.,To show the BLOODY HAND in burning red
13748,PART III.,Embroider'd on the curtain.
13749,PART III.,
13750,PART III.,And yet no gory stain was on the quilt--
13751,PART III.,The pillow in its place had slowly rotted;
13752,PART III.,"The floor alone retain'd the trace of guilt,"
13753,PART III.,Those boards obscurely spotted.
13754,PART III.,
13755,PART III.,"Obscurely spotted to the door, and thence"
13756,PART III.,With mazy doubles to the grated casement--
13757,PART III.,"Oh what a tale they told of fear intense,"
13758,PART III.,Of horror and amazement!
13759,PART III.,
13760,PART III.,What human creature in the dead of night
13761,PART III.,Had coursed like hunted hare that cruel distance?
13762,PART III.,"Had sought the door, the window in his flight,"
13763,PART III.,Striving for dear existence?
13764,PART III.,
13765,PART III.,What shrieking Spirit in that bloody room
13766,PART III.,Its mortal frame had violently quitted?--
13767,PART III.,"Across the sunbeam, with a sudden gloom,"
13768,PART III.,A ghostly Shadow flitted.
13769,PART III.,
13770,PART III.,"Across the sunbeam, and along the wall,"
13771,PART III.,"But painted on the air so very dimly,"
13772,PART III.,"It hardly veil'd the tapestry at all,"
13773,PART III.,Or portrait frowning grimly.
13774,PART III.,
13775,PART III.,"O'er all there hung the shadow of a fear,"
13776,PART III.,"A sense of mystery the spirit daunted,"
13777,PART III.,"And said, as plain as whisper in the ear,"

13839,A SEA-SIDE SKETCH.,"Despair upon him when his hopes were foil'd,"

16953,XXIV.,"That was born to his beggar's fare,"
16954,XXIV.,And how he had stolen the royal crown

16964,XXV.,"I was judge, myself, and jury, and all,"
16965,XXV.,And solemnly tried the cause.

16970,XXVI.,"But the beggar man would not plead, but cried"

16973,XXVI.,"When the law and a thief have quarrels,"
16974,XXVI.,There was not a Christian soul alive
16975,XXVI.,To speak a word for his morals.

16986,XXVII.,
16987,XXVII.,
16988,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
16989,XXVIII.,
16990,XXVIII.,So I haul'd him off to the gallows' foot.
16991,XXVIII.,And blinded him in his bags;
16992,XXVIII.,"'Twas a weary job to heave him up,"
16993,XXVIII.,For a doom'd man always lags;
16994,XXVIII.,But by ten of the clock he was off his legs

16996,XXVIII.,
16997,XXVIII.,
16998,XXIX.,XXIX.

17255,I.,Ali Ben Ali (did you never read
17256,I.,"His wond'rous acts that chronicles relate,--"
17257,I.,How there was one in pity might exceed
17258,I.,The Sack of Troy?) Magnificent he sate
17259,I.,Upon the throne of greatness--great indeed!
17260,I.,For those that he had under him were great--
17261,I.,"The horse he rode on, shod with silver nails,"
17262,I.,Was a Bashaw--Bashaws have horses' tails.
17263,I.,
17264,I.,
17265,II.,II.
17266,II.,
17267,II.,Ali was cruel--a most cruel one!
17268,II.,'Tis rumored he had strangled his own mother--
17269,II.,"Howbeit such deeds of darkness he had done,"
17270,II.,'Tis thought he would have slain his elder brother
17271,II.,And sister too--but happily that none
17272,II.,"Did live within harm's length of one another,"
17273,II.,Else he had sent the Sun in all its blaze
17274,II.,"To endless night, and shorten'd the Moon's days."
17275,II.,
17276,II.,
17277,III.,III.
17278,III.,
17279,III.,"Despotic power, that mars a weak man's wit,"
17280,III.,"And makes a bad man--absolutely bad,"
17281,III.,Made Ali wicked--to a fault:--'tis fit
17282,III.,Monarchs should have some check-strings; but he had
17283,III.,"No curb upon his will--no, not a _bit_--"
17284,III.,Wherefore he did not reign well--and full glad
17285,III.,His slaves had been to hang him--but they falter'd
17286,III.,"And let him live unhang'd--and still unalter'd,"
17287,III.,

17289,IV.,IV.
17290,IV.,
17291,IV.,"Until he got a sage-bush of a beard,"

17294,IV.,Grew downward like old women and cow's tail;
17295,IV.,"Being a sign of age--some gray appear'd,"
17296,IV.,Mingling with duskier brown its warnings pale;
17297,IV.,"But yet, not so poetic as when Time"

17304,V.,"His royal bosom that he had no son,"
17305,V.,"No living child of the more noble sex,"
17306,V.,To stand in his Morocco shoes--not one
17307,V.,To make a negro-pollard--or tread necks
17308,V.,"When he was gone--doom'd, when his days were done,"
17309,V.,To leave the very city of his fame
17310,V.,Without an Ali to keep up his name.
17311,V.,
17312,V.,
17313,VI.,VI.
17314,VI.,
17315,VI.,"Therefore he chose a lady for his love,"
17316,VI.,Singling from out the herd one stag-eyed dear;
17317,VI.,"So call'd, because her lustrous eyes, above"
17318,VI.,"All eyes, were dark, and timorous, and clear;"
17319,VI.,"Then, through his Muftis piously he strove,"
17320,VI.,And drumm'd with proxy-prayers Mohammed's ear:
17321,VI.,"Knowing a boy for certain must come of it,"
17322,VI.,Or else he was not praying to his Profit.

17325,VII.,VII.
17326,VII.,
17327,VII.,"Beer will grow mothery, and ladies fair"
17328,VII.,Will grow like beer; so did that stag-eyed dame:
17329,VII.,"Ben Ali, hoping for a son and heir,"
17330,VII.,"Boy'd up his hopes, and even chose a name"
17331,VII.,Of mighty hero that his child should bear;
17332,VII.,He made so certain ere his chicken came:--
17333,VII.,"But oh! all worldly wit is little worth,"
17334,VII.,Nor knoweth what to-morrow will bring forth!
17335,VII.,
17336,VII.,
17337,VIII.,VIII.
17338,VIII.,
17339,VIII.,"To-morrow came, and with to-morrow's sun"
17340,VIII.,"A little daughter to this world of sins,--"
17341,VIII.,_Miss_-fortunes never come alone--so one
17342,VIII.,"Brought on another, like a pair of twins:"
17343,VIII.,Twins! female twins!--it was enough to stun
17344,VIII.,Their little wits and scare them from their skins
17345,VIII.,"To hear their father stamp, and curse, and swear,"
17346,VIII.,Pulling his beard because he had no heir.
17347,VIII.,
17348,VIII.,
17349,IX.,IX.
17350,IX.,
17351,IX.,Then strove their stag-eyed mother to calm down

17353,IX.,"""Oh! Most Serene! why dost thou stamp and frown,"
17354,IX.,"And box the compass of the royal chest?"""
17355,IX.,"""Ah! thou wilt mar that portly trunk, I own"

17361,X.,X.
17362,X.,
17363,X.,"But not her words, nor e'en her tears, could slack"
17364,X.,"The quicklime of his rage, that hotter grew:"
17365,X.,He call'd his slave to bring an ample sack
17366,X.,Wherein a woman might be poked--a few
17367,X.,Dark grimly men felt pity and look'd black
17368,X.,At this sad order; but their slaveships knew
17369,X.,"When any dared demur, his sword so bending"
17370,X.,"Cut off the ""head and front of their offending."""
17371,X.,
17372,X.,
17373,XI.,XI.
17374,XI.,
17375,XI.,"For Ali had a sword, much like himself,"
17376,XI.,"A crooked blade, guilty of human gore--"
17377,XI.,The trophies it had lopp'd from many an elf
17378,XI.,Were struck at his _head_-quarters by the score--
17379,XI.,"Not yet in peace belaid it on the shelf,"
17380,XI.,"But jested with it, and his wit cut sore;"
17381,XI.,So that (as they of Public Houses speak)
17382,XI.,He often did his dozen _butts_ a week.
17383,XI.,
17384,XI.,
17385,XII.,XII.
17386,XII.,
17387,XII.,"Therefore his slaves, with most obedient fears,"
17388,XII.,Came with the sack the lady to enclose;
17389,XII.,"In vain from her stag-eyes ""the big round tears"
17390,XII.,"Coursed one another down her innocent nose"";"
17391,XII.,In vain her tongue wept sorrow in their ears;
17392,XII.,"Though there were some felt willing to oppose,"
17393,XII.,"Yet when their heads came in their heads, that minute,"
17394,XII.,"Though 'twas a piteous _case_, they put her in it."
17395,XII.,
17396,XII.,
17397,XIII.,XIII.
17398,XIII.,
17399,XIII.,"And when the sack was tied, some two or three"
17400,XIII.,Of these black undertakers slowly brought her
17401,XIII.,To a kind of Moorish Serpentine; for she
17402,XIII.,Was doom'd to have a winding sheet of water.
17403,XIII.,"Then farewell, earth--farewell to the green tree--"
17404,XIII.,"Farewell, the sun--the moon--each little daughter!"

17414,XIV.,"A ring above her, like a water-knell;"
17415,XIV.,"A moment more, and all its face was still'd,"
17416,XIV.,And not a guilty heave was left to tell
17417,XIV.,That underneath its calm and blue transparence
17418,XIV.,"A dame lay drownèd in her sack, like Clarence."

17426,XV.,The lady's natal star with pale afright
17427,XV.,"Fainted and fell--and what were stars before,"
17428,XV.,Turn'd comets as the tale was brought to light;

17450,XVII.,Of music bubbling through the surface light;
17451,XVII.,"The leaves are motionless, the breezes hush"
17452,XVII.,To listen to the air--and through the night
17453,XVII.,"There come these words of a most plaintive ditty,"

18080,XI.,"But took his corks, and merely had a bath;"
18081,XI.,"And once he pull'd a trigger at his skull,"
18082,XI.,But merely broke a window in his wrath;
18083,XI.,"And once, his hopeless being to annul,"

18095,XII.,"To leave life's pleasant city as we must,"
18096,XII.,"In Death's most dreary spunging-house to lie,"
18097,XII.,Where even all our personals must go

18119,XIV.,The flow'rs had shut their eyes--the zephyr light
18120,XIV.,"Was gone, for it had rock'd the leaves to sleep."
18121,XIV.,And all the little birds had laid their heads

18132,XV.,"His Deh Vieni, and such amorous airs,"
18133,XV.,"Born only underneath Italian skies,"

18137,XVI.,XVI.
18138,XVI.,
18139,XVI.,Sweet was the tune--the words were even sweeter--
18140,XVI.,"Praising her eyes, her lips, her nose, her hair,"

18154,XVII.,"To ask her mirror ""if it was not so?"""
18155,XVII.,"'Twas a large mirror, none the worse for wear,"

18178,XIX.,"That fair reflection, tho' her eyes were closed,"
18179,XIX.,"A beauty-bright as it was wont to be,"
18180,XIX.,A portrait Fancy painted while she dozed:

18227,XXIII.,In truth it was a change!--she had obey'd
18228,XXIII.,"The holy Pope before her chest grew narrow,"
18229,XXIII.,But spectacles and palsy seem'd to make her
18230,XXIII.,Something between a Glassite and a Quaker.

18233,XXIV.,XXIV.
18234,XXIV.,
18235,XXIV.,"Her grief and gall meanwhile were quite extreme,"

18239,XXIV.,"The fancy madden'd her; but now the dream,"
18240,XXIV.,"Grown thin by getting bigger, like a bubble,"

18244,XXIV.,
18245,XXV.,XXV.
18246,XXV.,
18247,XXV.,And here--just here--as she began to heed
18248,XXV.,"The real world, her clock chimed out its score;"
18249,XXV.,"A clock it was of the Venetian breed,"
18250,XXV.,That cried the hour from one to twenty-four;
18251,XXV.,The works moreover standing in some need
18252,XXV.,"Of workmanship, it struck some dozens more;"
18253,XXV.,"A warning voice that clench'd Bianca's fears,"

18257,XXVI.,XXVI.
18258,XXVI.,
18259,XXVI.,"At fifteen chimes she was but half a nun,"
18260,XXVI.,By twenty she had quite renounced the veil;
18261,XXVI.,"She thought of Julio just at twenty-one,"
18262,XXVI.,"And thirty made her very sad and pale,"
18263,XXVI.,To paint that ruin where her charms would run;
18264,XXVI.,"At forty all the maid began to fail,"
18265,XXVI.,"And thought no higher, as the late dream cross'd her,"
18266,XXVI.,"Of single blessedness, than single Gloster."

18268,XXVI.,
18269,XXVII.,XXVII.
18270,XXVII.,
18271,XXVII.,"And so Bianca changed;--the next sweet even,"
18272,XXVII.,"With Julio in a black Venetian bark,"
18273,XXVII.,"Row'd slow and stealthily--the hour, eleven,"
18274,XXVII.,Just sounding from the tow'r of old St. Mark;
18275,XXVII.,"She sate with eyes turn'd quietly to heav'n,"
18276,XXVII.,Perchance rejoicing in the grateful dark
18277,XXVII.,"That veil'd her blushing cheek,--for Julio brought her"

18279,XXVII.,
18280,XXVII.,
18281,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
18282,XXVIII.,
18283,XXVIII.,But what a puzzle is one's serious mind
18284,XXVIII.,"To open;--oysters, when the ice is thick,"
18285,XXVIII.,Are not so difficult and disinclin'd;
18286,XXVIII.,And Julio felt the declaration stick
18287,XXVIII.,About his throat in a most awful kind;
18288,XXVIII.,"However, he contrived by bits to pick"
18289,XXVIII.,"His trouble forth,--much like a rotten cork"

18293,XXIX.,XXIX.
18294,XXIX.,
18295,XXIX.,But love is still the quickest of all readers;
18296,XXIX.,And Julio spent besides those signs profuse
18297,XXIX.,"That English telegraphs and foreign pleaders,"
18298,XXIX.,"In help of language, are so apt to use,"
18299,XXIX.,"Arms, shoulders, fingers, all were interceders,"
18300,XXIX.,"Nods, shrugs, and bends,--Bianca could not choose"
18301,XXIX.,"But soften to his suit with more facility,"
18302,XXIX.,He told his story with so much agility.

18322,XXXI.,Meanwhile her eyes glanced on the silver sphere
18323,XXXI.,That even now began to steal behind
18324,XXXI.,"A dewy vapor, which was lingering near,"
18325,XXXI.,"Wherein the dull moon crept all dim and pale,"

18335,XXXII.,"Meanwhile, remindful of the convent bars,"
18336,XXXII.,"Bianca did not watch these signs in vain,"
18337,XXXII.,"But turn'd to Julio at the dark eclipse,"

18345,XXXIII.,Bestow'd a something on her cheek that smack'd
18346,XXXIII.,(Tho' quite in silence) of ambrosial sweetness;
18347,XXXIII.,That made her think all other kisses lack'd
18348,XXXIII.,"Till then, but what she knew not, of completeness;"
18349,XXXIII.,"Being used but sisterly salutes to feel,"
18350,XXXIII.,Insipid things--like sandwiches of veal.

18355,XXXIV.,"He took her hand, and soon she felt him wring"

18358,XXXIV.,"About her waist that had been clasp'd by none,"
18359,XXXIV.,"Their dear confessions I forbear to sing,"
18360,XXXIV.,Since cold description would but be outrun;

18469,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
18470,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"So, like a Christmas pedagogue,"
18471,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,Poor Tim was forc'd to do--

18479,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
18480,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Now Tim he woo'd a servant-maid,"

18500,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Her face was bad, her figure worse,"

18519,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
18520,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"But like a wicked murderer,"

18530,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"But when another week was gone,"

18533,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,Of hanging on a rope.
18534,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
18535,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,Ah! when he hid his bloody work

19807,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,So fierce the lightning flashed. In all their days
19808,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"The oldest smugglers had not seen such flashing,"
19809,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And they are used to many a pretty blaze,"
19810,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,To keep their Hollands from an awkward clashing
19811,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,With hostile cutters in our creeks and bays:
19812,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And truly one could think, without much lashing"
19813,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"The fancy, that those coasting clouds, so awful"
19814,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And black, were fraught with spirits as unlawful."
19815,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19816,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The gay Parade grew thin--all the fair crowd
19817,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Vanished--as if they knew their own attractions,--"
19818,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,For now the lightning through a near-hand cloud
19819,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Began to make some very crooked fractions--
19820,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Only some few remained that were not cowed,"
19821,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"A few rough sailors, who had been in actions,"
19822,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And sundry boatmen, that with quick yeo's,"
19823,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Lest it should _blow_,--were pulling up the _Rose_:"
19824,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19825,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"(No flower, but a boat)--some more were hauling"
19826,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The _Regent_ by the head:--another crew
19827,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,With that same cry peculiar to their _calling_--
19828,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Were heaving up the _Hope_:--and as they knew
19829,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The very gods themselves oft get a mauling
19830,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"In their own realms, the seamen wisely drew"
19831,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"The _Neptune_ rather higher on the beach,"
19832,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,That he might lie beyond his billows' reach.
19833,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19834,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And now the storm, with its despotic power,"
19835,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Had all usurped the azure of the skies,"
19836,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Making our daylight darker by an hour,"
19837,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And some few drops--of an unusual size--
19838,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Few and distinct--scarce twenty to the shower,"
19839,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Fell like huge teardrops from a giant's eyes--
19840,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,But then this sprinkle thickened in a trice
19841,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And rained much _harder_--in good solid ice.
19842,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19843,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Oh for a very storm of words to show
19844,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,How this fierce crash of hail came rushing o'er us!
19845,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Handel would make the gusty organs blow
19846,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Grandly, and a rich storm in music score us:--"
19847,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"But ev'n his music seemed composed and low,"
19848,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,When we were _handled_ by this Hailstone Chorus;
19849,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Whilst thunder rumbled, with its awful sound,"
19850,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And frozen comfits rolled along the ground--
19851,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19852,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,As big as bullets:--Lord! how they did batter
19853,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Our crazy tiles:--and now the lightning flashed
19854,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Alternate with the dark, until the latter"
19855,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Was rarest of the two!--the gust too dashed
19856,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"So terribly, I thought the hail must shatter"
19857,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Some panes,--and so it did--and first it smashed"
19858,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The very square where I had chose my station
19859,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,To watch the general illumination.
19860,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19861,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Another, and another, still came in,"
19862,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And fell in jingling ruin at my feet,"
19863,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Making transparent holes that let me win
19864,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Some samples of the storm:--Oh! it was sweet
19865,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"To think I had a shelter for my skin,"
19866,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Culling them through these ""loopholes of retreat""--"
19867,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Which in a little we began to glaze--
19868,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Chiefly with a jacktowel and some baize!
19869,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19870,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"But which, the cloud had passed o'erhead, but played"
19871,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Its crooked fires in constant flashes still,"
19872,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Just in our rear, as though it had arrayed"
19873,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Its heavy batteries at Fairlight Mill,"
19874,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"So that it lit the town, and grandly made"
19875,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The rugged features of the Castle Hill
19876,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Leap, like a birth, from chaos into light,"
19877,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And then relapse into the gloomy night--
19878,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19879,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"As parcel of the cloud;--the clouds themselves,"
19880,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Like monstrous crags and summits everlasting,"
19881,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Piled each on each in most gigantic shelves,"
19882,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,That Milton's devils were engaged in blasting.
19883,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,We could e'en fancy Satan and his elves
19884,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Busy upon those crags, and ever casting"
19885,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Huge fragments loose,--and that we _felt_ the sound"
19886,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,They made in falling to the startled ground.
19887,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19888,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And so the tempest scowled away,--and soon"
19889,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Timidly shining through its skirts of jet,"
19890,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"We saw the rim of the pacific moon,"
19891,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Like a bright fish entangled in a net,"
19892,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Flashing its silver sides,--how sweet a boon"
19893,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Seemed her sweet light, as though it would beget,"
19894,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"With that fair smile, a calm upon the seas--"
19895,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Peace in the sky--and coolness in the breeze!
19896,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19897,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Meantime the hail had ceased:--and all the brood
19898,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Of glaziers stole abroad to count their gains;
19899,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,At every window there were maids who stood
19900,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Lamenting o'er the glass's small remains,--"
19901,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Or with coarse linens made the fractions good,"
19902,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Stanching the wind in all the wounded panes,--"
19903,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Or, holding candles to the panes, in doubt"
19904,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The wind resolved--blowing the candles out.
19905,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19906,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"No house was whole that had a southern front,--"
19907,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,No greenhouse but the same mishap befell;
19908,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"_Bow_-windows and _bell_-glasses bore the brunt,--"
19909,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,No sex in glass was spared!--For those who dwell
19910,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"On each hill-side, you might have swum a punt"
19911,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,In any of their parlors;--Mrs. Snell
19912,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Was slopped out of her seat,--and Mr. Hitchin"
19913,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Had a _flower_-garden washed into a _Kitchen_.
19914,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19915,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"But still the sea was mild, and quite disclaimed"
19916,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,The recent violence.--Each after each
19917,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"The gentle waves a gentle murmur framed,"
19918,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Tapping, like woodpeckers, the hollow beach."
19919,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Howbeit his _weather eye_ the seaman aimed
19920,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Across the calm, and hinted by his speech"
19921,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"A gale next morning--and when morning broke,"
19922,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"There was a gale--""quite equal to bespoke."""
19923,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,

19926,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,For then the tide is _serving at the bar_)
19927,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Rose such a swell--I never saw one greater!
19928,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Black, jagged billows rearing up in war"
19929,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Like ragged roaring bears against the baiter,"
19930,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"With lots of froth upon the shingle shed,"
19931,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Like stout poured out with a fine _beachy head_.
19932,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19933,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"No open boat was open to a fare,"
19934,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Or launched that morn on seven-shilling trips;
19935,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,No bathing woman waded--none would dare
19936,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,A dipping in the wave--but waived their dips;
19937,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"No seagull ventured on the stormy air,"
19938,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And all the dreary coast was clear of ships;
19939,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,For two _lea shores_ upon the River Lea
19940,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Are not so perilous as one at sea.
19941,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19942,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Awe-struck we sat, and gazed upon the scene"

19944,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"A boiling ocean of mixed black and green,"
19945,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"A sky of copper color, grim and surly,--"
19946,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"When lo, in that vast hollow scooped between"
19947,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Two rolling Alps of water,--white and curly!"
19948,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"We saw a pair of little arms a-skimming,"

19951,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Sometimes a hand--sometimes a little shoe--

19953,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Just like a dabbled seaweed rose to view,"
19954,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Sometimes a knee--sometimes a back was bare--
19955,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,At last a frightful summerset he threw
19956,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Right on the shingles. Any one could swear
19957,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"The lad was dead--without a chance of perjury,"
19958,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And battered by the surge beyond all surgery!
19959,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,
19960,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"However, we snatched up the corse thus thrown,"
19961,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"Intending, Christian-like, to sod and turf it,"
19962,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And after venting Pity's sigh and groan,"
19963,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,Then curiosity began with _her_ fit;
19964,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,And lo! the features of the Small Unknown!
19965,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,'Twas he that of the surf had had this surfeit!
19966,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,"And in his fob, the cause of late monopolies,"
19967,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,We found a contract signed with Mephistopheles!
19968,AND THE LITTLE UNKNOWN.,

22658,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"And grasping at her mane with both my cold convulsive hands,"
22659,THE DESERT-BORN[34],Away we flew--away! away! across the shifting sands!
22660,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"My eyes were closed in utter dread of such a fearful race,"
22661,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"But yet by certain signs I knew we went no earthly pace,"
22662,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"For turn whichever way we might, the wind with equal force"
22663,THE DESERT-BORN[34],Rush'd like a horrid hurricane still adverse to our course--
22664,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"One moment close at hand I heard the roaring Syrian Sea,"
22665,THE DESERT-BORN[34],The next is only murmur'd like the humming of a bee!
22666,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"And when I dared at last to glance across the wild immense,"
22667,THE DESERT-BORN[34],Oh ne'er shall I forget the whirl that met the dizzy sense!
22668,THE DESERT-BORN[34],
22669,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"What seem'd a little sprig of fern, ere lips could reckon twain,"
22670,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"A palm of forty cubits high, we passed it on the plain!"
22671,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"What tongue could tell,--what pencil paint,--what pen describe the ride?"
22672,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"Now off--now on--now up--now down,--and flung from side to side!"
22673,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"I tried to speak, but had no voice, to soothe her with its tone--"
22674,THE DESERT-BORN[34],My scanty breath was jolted out with many a sudden groan--
22675,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"My joints were racked--my back was strained, so firmly I had clung--"
22676,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"My nostrils gush'd, and thrice my teeth had bitten through my tongue--"
22677,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"When lo!--farewell all hope of life!--she turn'd and faced the rocks,"
22678,THE DESERT-BORN[34],None but a flying horse could clear those monstrous granite blocks!
22679,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"So thought I,--but I little knew the desert pride and fire,"
22680,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"Deriv'd from a most deer-like dam, and lion-hearted sire;"
22681,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"Little I guess'd the energy of muscle, blood, and bone,"
22682,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"Bound after bound, with eager springs, she clear'd each massive stone;--"
22683,THE DESERT-BORN[34],Nine mortal leaps were pass'd before a huge gray rock at length
22684,THE DESERT-BORN[34],Stood planted there as if to dare her utmost pitch of strength--
22685,THE DESERT-BORN[34],My time was come! that granite heap my monument of death!
22686,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"She paused, she snorted loud and long, and drew a fuller breath;"
22687,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"Nine strides and then a louder beat that warn'd me of her spring,"
22688,THE DESERT-BORN[34],I felt her rising in the air like eagle on the wing--
22689,THE DESERT-BORN[34],But oh! the crash!--the hideous shock!--the million sparks around!
22690,THE DESERT-BORN[34],Her hindmost hoofs had struck the crest of that prodigious mound!
22691,THE DESERT-BORN[34],
22692,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"Wild shriek'd the headlong Desert-Born--or else 'twas demon's mirth,"

22701,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"My heart was still--my pulses stopp'd--midway 'twixt life and death,"
22702,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"With pain unspeakable I fetch'd the fragment of a breath,"
22703,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"Not vital air enough to frame one short and feeble sigh,"
22704,THE DESERT-BORN[34],Yet even that I loath'd because it would not let me die.
22705,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"Oh! slowly, slowly, slowly on, from starry night till morn,"
22706,THE DESERT-BORN[34],"Time flapp'd along, with leaden wings, across that waste forlorn!"
22707,THE DESERT-BORN[34],I cursed the hour that brought me first within this world of strife--
22708,THE DESERT-BORN[34],A sore and heavy sin it is to scorn the gift of life--
22709,THE DESERT-BORN[34],But who hath felt a horse's weight oppress his laboring breast?

24319,RURAL FELICITY.,"There's something about a dairy farm, with its"
24320,RURAL FELICITY.,"different kinds of live stock,"
24321,RURAL FELICITY.,"That puts one in mind of Paradise, and Adam"
24322,RURAL FELICITY.,and his innocent flock;
24323,RURAL FELICITY.,But somehow the good old Elysium fields have
24324,RURAL FELICITY.,"not been well handed down,"
24325,RURAL FELICITY.,And as yet I have found no fields to prefer to dear
24326,RURAL FELICITY.,Leicester Fields up in town.
24327,RURAL FELICITY.,
24328,RURAL FELICITY.,"To be sure it is pleasant to walk in the meads,"
24329,RURAL FELICITY.,"and so I should like for miles,"
24330,RURAL FELICITY.,If it wasn't for clodpoles of carpenters that put
24331,RURAL FELICITY.,up such crooked stiles;
24332,RURAL FELICITY.,"For the bars jut out, and you must jut out, till"
24333,RURAL FELICITY.,"you're almost broken in two,"
24334,RURAL FELICITY.,"If you clamber you're certain sure of a fall, and"
24335,RURAL FELICITY.,you stick if you try to creep through.
24336,RURAL FELICITY.,"Of course, in the end, one learns how to climb"
24337,RURAL FELICITY.,"without constant tumbles down,"
24338,RURAL FELICITY.,"But still as to walking so stylishly, it's pleasanter"
24339,RURAL FELICITY.,done about town.
24340,RURAL FELICITY.,"There's a way, I know, to avoid the stiles, and"
24341,RURAL FELICITY.,"that's by a walk in a lane,"
24342,RURAL FELICITY.,"And I did find a very nice shady one, but I never"
24343,RURAL FELICITY.,dared go again;
24344,RURAL FELICITY.,"For who should I meet but a rampaging bull, that"
24345,RURAL FELICITY.,"wouldn't be kept in the pound,"
24346,RURAL FELICITY.,"A trying to toss the whole world at once, by sticking"
24347,RURAL FELICITY.,his horns in the ground?
24348,RURAL FELICITY.,"And that, by the bye, is another thing, that pulls"
24349,RURAL FELICITY.,"rural pleasures down,"
24350,RURAL FELICITY.,"Ev'ry day in the country is cattle-day, and there's"
24351,RURAL FELICITY.,only two up in town.
24352,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then I've rose with the sun, to go brushing away"
24353,RURAL FELICITY.,"at the first early pearly dew,"
24354,RURAL FELICITY.,"And to meet Aurory, or whatever's her name, and"
24355,RURAL FELICITY.,I always got wetted through;
24356,RURAL FELICITY.,"My shoes are like sops, and I caught a bad cold,"
24357,RURAL FELICITY.,"and a nice draggle-tail to my gown,"
24358,RURAL FELICITY.,"That's not the way that we bathe our feet, or"
24359,RURAL FELICITY.,"wear our pearls, up in town!"
24360,RURAL FELICITY.,"As for picking flow'rs, I have tried at a hedge,"
24361,RURAL FELICITY.,"sweet eglantine roses to snatch,"
24362,RURAL FELICITY.,"But, mercy on us! how nettles will sting, and how"
24363,RURAL FELICITY.,the long brambles do scratch;
24364,RURAL FELICITY.,Besides hitching my hat on a nasty thorn that
24365,RURAL FELICITY.,"tore all the bows from the crown,"
24366,RURAL FELICITY.,One may walk long enough without hats branching
24367,RURAL FELICITY.,"off, or losing one's bows about town."
24368,RURAL FELICITY.,"But worse than that, in a long rural walk, suppose"
24369,RURAL FELICITY.,"that it blows up for rain,"
24370,RURAL FELICITY.,And all at once you discover yourself in a real St.
24371,RURAL FELICITY.,Swithin's Lane;
24372,RURAL FELICITY.,"And while you're running all ducked and drown'd,"
24373,RURAL FELICITY.,"and pelted with sixpenny drops,"
24374,RURAL FELICITY.,"""Fine weather,"" you hear the farmers say; ""a"
24375,RURAL FELICITY.,"nice growing show'r for the crops!"""
24376,RURAL FELICITY.,"But who's to crop me another new hat, or grow"
24377,RURAL FELICITY.,me another new gown?
24378,RURAL FELICITY.,For you can't take a shilling fare with a plough as
24379,RURAL FELICITY.,you do with the hackneys in town.
24380,RURAL FELICITY.,
24381,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then my nevys too, they must drag me off to go"
24382,RURAL FELICITY.,"with them gathering nuts,"
24383,RURAL FELICITY.,And we always set out by the longest way and
24384,RURAL FELICITY.,return by the shortest cuts.
24385,RURAL FELICITY.,"Short cuts, indeed! But it's nuts to them, to get"
24386,RURAL FELICITY.,a poor lustyish aunt
24387,RURAL FELICITY.,To scramble through gaps or jump over a
24388,RURAL FELICITY.,"ditch, when they're morally certain she can't,--"
24389,RURAL FELICITY.,"For whenever I get in some awkward scrape, and"
24390,RURAL FELICITY.,"it's almost daily the case,"
24391,RURAL FELICITY.,"Tho' they don't laugh out, the mischievous brats,"
24392,RURAL FELICITY.,I see the hooray! in their face.
24393,RURAL FELICITY.,
24394,RURAL FELICITY.,"There's the other day, for my sight is short, and"
24395,RURAL FELICITY.,"I saw what was green beyond,"
24396,RURAL FELICITY.,And thought it was all terry firmer and grass till
24397,RURAL FELICITY.,I walked in the duckweed pond:
24398,RURAL FELICITY.,Or perhaps when I've pully-hauled up a bank
24399,RURAL FELICITY.,"they see me come launching down,"
24400,RURAL FELICITY.,As none but a stout London female can do as is
24401,RURAL FELICITY.,come a first time out of town.
24402,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then how sweet, some say, on a mossy bank a"
24403,RURAL FELICITY.,"verdurous seat to find,"
24404,RURAL FELICITY.,But for my part I always found it a joy that
24405,RURAL FELICITY.,brought a repentance behind;
24406,RURAL FELICITY.,For the juicy grass with its nasty green has stained
24407,RURAL FELICITY.,a whole breadth of my gown--
24408,RURAL FELICITY.,"And when gowns are dyed, I needn't say, it's"
24409,RURAL FELICITY.,much better done up in town.
24410,RURAL FELICITY.,"As for country fare, the first morning I came I"
24411,RURAL FELICITY.,heard such a shrill piece of work!
24412,RURAL FELICITY.,And ever since--and it's ten days ago--we've lived
24413,RURAL FELICITY.,upon nothing but pork;
24414,RURAL FELICITY.,"One Sunday except, and then I turn'd sick, a"
24415,RURAL FELICITY.,plague take all countrified cooks!
24416,RURAL FELICITY.,"Why didn't they tell me, _before_ I had dined, they"
24417,RURAL FELICITY.,made pigeon pies of the rooks?
24418,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then the gooseberry wine, tho' it's pleasant when"
24419,RURAL FELICITY.,"up, it doesn't agree when it's down,"
24420,RURAL FELICITY.,But it served me right like a gooseberry fool to
24421,RURAL FELICITY.,look for champagne out of town!
24422,RURAL FELICITY.,To be sure cousin G. meant it all for the best
24423,RURAL FELICITY.,"when he started this pastoral plan,"
24424,RURAL FELICITY.,And his wife is a worthy domestical soul and she
24425,RURAL FELICITY.,"teaches me all that she can,"
24426,RURAL FELICITY.,"Such as making of cheese, and curing of hams,"
24427,RURAL FELICITY.,"but I'm sure that I never shall learn,"
24428,RURAL FELICITY.,And I've fetched more back-ache than butter as
24429,RURAL FELICITY.,yet by chumping away at the churn;
24430,RURAL FELICITY.,"But in making hay, tho' it's tanning work, I"
24431,RURAL FELICITY.,"found it more easy to make,"
24432,RURAL FELICITY.,"But it tries one's legs, and no great relief when"
24433,RURAL FELICITY.,you're tired to sit down on the rake.
24434,RURAL FELICITY.,"I'd a country dance too at harvest home, with a"
24435,RURAL FELICITY.,"regular country clown,"
24436,RURAL FELICITY.,"But, Lord! they don't hug one round the waist"
24437,RURAL FELICITY.,and give one such smacks in town!
24438,RURAL FELICITY.,Then I've tried to make friends with the birds
24439,RURAL FELICITY.,"and the beasts, but they take to such curious rigs,"
24440,RURAL FELICITY.,"I'm always at odds with the turkey-cock, and I"
24441,RURAL FELICITY.,can't even please the pigs.
24442,RURAL FELICITY.,The very hens pick holes in my hands when I
24443,RURAL FELICITY.,"grope for the new-laid eggs,"
24444,RURAL FELICITY.,And the gander comes hissing out of the pond
24445,RURAL FELICITY.,on purpose to flap at my legs.
24446,RURAL FELICITY.,I've been bump'd in a ditch by the cow without
24447,RURAL FELICITY.,"horns, and the old sow trampled me down,"
24448,RURAL FELICITY.,The beasts are as vicious as any wild beasts--but
24449,RURAL FELICITY.,they're kept in cages in town!
24450,RURAL FELICITY.,Another thing is the nasty dogs--thro' the village
24451,RURAL FELICITY.,I hardly can stir
24452,RURAL FELICITY.,Since giving a bumpkin a pint of beer just to call
24453,RURAL FELICITY.,off a barking cur;
24454,RURAL FELICITY.,And now you would swear all the dogs in the
24455,RURAL FELICITY.,"place were set on to hunt me down,"
24456,RURAL FELICITY.,But neither the brutes nor the people I think are
24457,RURAL FELICITY.,as civilly bred as in town.
24458,RURAL FELICITY.,"Last night about twelve I was scared broad awake,"
24459,RURAL FELICITY.,"and all in a tremble of fright,"
24460,RURAL FELICITY.,But instead of a family murder it proved an owl
24461,RURAL FELICITY.,that flies screeching at night.
24462,RURAL FELICITY.,Then there's plenty of ricks and stacks all
24463,RURAL FELICITY.,"about, and I can't help dreaming of Swing--"
24464,RURAL FELICITY.,"In short, I think that a plastoral life is not the"
24465,RURAL FELICITY.,most happiest thing;
24466,RURAL FELICITY.,For besides all the troubles I've mentioned before
24467,RURAL FELICITY.,"as endur'd for rurality's sake,"
24468,RURAL FELICITY.,"I've been stung by the bees, and I've set among"
24469,RURAL FELICITY.,"ants, and once--ugh! I trod on a snake!"
24470,RURAL FELICITY.,"And as to moskitoes they tortured me so, for I've"
24471,RURAL FELICITY.,"got a particular skin,"
24472,RURAL FELICITY.,I do think it's the gnats coming out of the ponds
24473,RURAL FELICITY.,that drives the poor suicides in!
24474,RURAL FELICITY.,And after all an't there new-laid eggs to be had
24475,RURAL FELICITY.,upon Holborn Hill?
24476,RURAL FELICITY.,"And dairy-fed pork in Broad St. Giles's, and fresh"
24477,RURAL FELICITY.,butter wherever you will?
24478,RURAL FELICITY.,And a covered cart that brings Cottage Bread
24479,RURAL FELICITY.,quite rustical-like and brown?
24480,RURAL FELICITY.,So one isn't so very uncountrified in the very
24481,RURAL FELICITY.,heart of the town.
24482,RURAL FELICITY.,"Howsomever my mind's made up, and although"
24483,RURAL FELICITY.,"I'm sure cousin Giles will be vext,"
24484,RURAL FELICITY.,I mean to book me an inside place up to town
24485,RURAL FELICITY.,"upon Saturday next,"
24486,RURAL FELICITY.,"And if nothing happens, soon after ten, I shall"
24487,RURAL FELICITY.,"be at the Old Bell and Crown,"
24488,RURAL FELICITY.,"And perhaps I may come to the country again,"

25130,A TRUE STORY.,
25131,A TRUE STORY.,
25132,A TRUE STORY.,"Of all our pains, since man was curst,"
25133,A TRUE STORY.,"I mean of body, not the mental,"
25134,A TRUE STORY.,"To name the worst, among the worst,"
25135,A TRUE STORY.,The dental sure is transcendental;
25136,A TRUE STORY.,"Some bit of masticating bone,"
25137,A TRUE STORY.,"That ought to help to clear a shelf,"
25138,A TRUE STORY.,"But lets its proper work alone,"
25139,A TRUE STORY.,And only seems to gnaw itself;
25140,A TRUE STORY.,"In fact, of any grave attack"
25141,A TRUE STORY.,"On victual there is little danger,"
25142,A TRUE STORY.,"'Tis so like coming to the _rack,_"
25143,A TRUE STORY.,As well as going to the manger.
25144,A TRUE STORY.,
25145,A TRUE STORY.,Old Hunks--it seemed a fit retort
25146,A TRUE STORY.,Of justice on his grinding ways--
25147,A TRUE STORY.,"Possessed a grinder of the sort,"
25148,A TRUE STORY.,That troubled all his latter days.
25149,A TRUE STORY.,"The best of friends fall out, and so"
25150,A TRUE STORY.,"His teeth had done some years ago,"
25151,A TRUE STORY.,"Save some old stumps with ragged root,"
25152,A TRUE STORY.,And they took turn about to shoot;
25153,A TRUE STORY.,"If he drank any chilly liquor,"
25154,A TRUE STORY.,They made it quite a point to throb;
25155,A TRUE STORY.,"But if he warmed it on the hob,"
25156,A TRUE STORY.,Why then they only twitched the quicker.
25157,A TRUE STORY.,
25158,A TRUE STORY.,One tooth--I wonder such a tooth
25159,A TRUE STORY.,Had never killed him in his youth--
25160,A TRUE STORY.,"One tooth he had with many fangs,"
25161,A TRUE STORY.,"That shot at once as many pangs,"
25162,A TRUE STORY.,It had a universal sting;
25163,A TRUE STORY.,One touch of that ecstatic stump
25164,A TRUE STORY.,"Could jerk his limbs and make him jump,"
25165,A TRUE STORY.,Just like a puppet on a string;
25166,A TRUE STORY.,"And what was worse than all, it had"
25167,A TRUE STORY.,A way of making others bad.
25168,A TRUE STORY.,"There is, as many know, a knack,"
25169,A TRUE STORY.,"With certain farming undertakers,"
25170,A TRUE STORY.,"And this same tooth pursued their track,"
25171,A TRUE STORY.,By adding _achers_ still to _achers_!
25172,A TRUE STORY.,
25173,A TRUE STORY.,"One way there is, that has been judged"
25174,A TRUE STORY.,"A certain cure, but Hunks was loth"
25175,A TRUE STORY.,"To pay the fee, and quite begrudged"
25176,A TRUE STORY.,To lose his tooth and money both;
25177,A TRUE STORY.,"In fact, a dentist and the wheel"
25178,A TRUE STORY.,"Of Fortune are a kindred cast,"
25179,A TRUE STORY.,"For after all is drawn, you feel"
25180,A TRUE STORY.,It's paying for a blank at last;
25181,A TRUE STORY.,"So Hunks went on from week to week,"
25182,A TRUE STORY.,And kept his torment in his cheek;
25183,A TRUE STORY.,"Oh! how it sometimes set him rocking,"
25184,A TRUE STORY.,"With that perpetual gnaw--gnaw--gnaw,"
25185,A TRUE STORY.,"His moans and groans were truly shocking,"
25186,A TRUE STORY.,"And loud,--altho' he held his jaw."
25187,A TRUE STORY.,Many a tug he gave his gum
25188,A TRUE STORY.,"And tooth, but still it would not come,"
25189,A TRUE STORY.,"Tho' tied to string by some firm thing,"
25190,A TRUE STORY.,"He could not draw it, do his best,"
25191,A TRUE STORY.,"By draw'rs, altho' he tried a chest."
25192,A TRUE STORY.,
25193,A TRUE STORY.,"At last, but after much debating,"
25194,A TRUE STORY.,"He joined a score of mouths in waiting,"
25195,A TRUE STORY.,"Like his, to have their troubles out."
25196,A TRUE STORY.,Sad sight it was to look about
25197,A TRUE STORY.,"At twenty faces making faces,"
25198,A TRUE STORY.,"With many a rampant trick and antic,"
25199,A TRUE STORY.,"For all were very horrid cases,"
25200,A TRUE STORY.,And made their owners nearly frantic.
25201,A TRUE STORY.,A little wicket now and then
25202,A TRUE STORY.,"Took one of these unhappy men,"
25203,A TRUE STORY.,"And out again the victim rushed,"
25204,A TRUE STORY.,While eyes and mouth together gushed;
25205,A TRUE STORY.,"At last arrived our hero's turn,"
25206,A TRUE STORY.,"Who plunged his hands in both his pockets,"
25207,A TRUE STORY.,"And down he sat, prepared to learn"
25208,A TRUE STORY.,How teeth are charmed to quit their sockets.
25209,A TRUE STORY.,
25210,A TRUE STORY.,"Those who have felt such operations,"
25211,A TRUE STORY.,"Alone can guess the sort of ache,"
25212,A TRUE STORY.,When his old tooth began to break
25213,A TRUE STORY.,The thread of old associations;
25214,A TRUE STORY.,"It touched a string in every part,"
25215,A TRUE STORY.,It had so many tender ties;
25216,A TRUE STORY.,"One cord seemed wrenching at his heart,"
25217,A TRUE STORY.,And two were tugging at his eyes;
25218,A TRUE STORY.,"""Bone of his bone,"" he felt, of course,"
25219,A TRUE STORY.,As husbands do in such divorce;
25220,A TRUE STORY.,"At last the fangs gave way a little,"
25221,A TRUE STORY.,"Hunks gave his head a backward jerk,"
25222,A TRUE STORY.,"And lo! the cause of all this work,"
25223,A TRUE STORY.,Went--where it used to send his victual!
25224,A TRUE STORY.,
25225,A TRUE STORY.,The monstrous pain of this proceeding
25226,A TRUE STORY.,"Had not so numbed his miser wit,"
25227,A TRUE STORY.,But in this slip he saw a hit
25228,A TRUE STORY.,"To save, at least, his purse from bleeding;"
25229,A TRUE STORY.,"So when the dentist sought his fees,"
25230,A TRUE STORY.,"Quoth Hunks, ""Let's finish, if you please,"""
25231,A TRUE STORY.,"""How, finish! why, it's out!""--""Oh no--"
25232,A TRUE STORY.,"'Tis you are out, to argue so;"
25233,A TRUE STORY.,I'm none of your before-hand tippers.
25234,A TRUE STORY.,"My tooth is in my head no doubt,"
25235,A TRUE STORY.,"But, as you say you pulled it out,"
25236,A TRUE STORY.,"Of course it's there--between your nippers,"""
25237,A TRUE STORY.,"""Zounds, sir! d'ye think I'd sell the truth"
25238,A TRUE STORY.,"To get a fee? no, wretch, I scorn it!"""
25239,A TRUE STORY.,"But Hunks still asked to see the tooth,"
25240,A TRUE STORY.,And swore by gum! he had not drawn it.
25241,A TRUE STORY.,
25242,A TRUE STORY.,"His end obtained, he took his leave,"
25243,A TRUE STORY.,A secret chuckle in his sleeve;
25244,A TRUE STORY.,"The joke was worthy to produce one,"
25245,A TRUE STORY.,"To think, by favor of his wit"
25246,A TRUE STORY.,How well a dentist had been bit
25247,A TRUE STORY.,"By one old stump, and that a loose one!"
25248,A TRUE STORY.,"The thing was worth a laugh, but mirth"
25249,A TRUE STORY.,Is still the frailest thing on earth:
25250,A TRUE STORY.,Alas! how often when a joke
25251,A TRUE STORY.,"Seems in our sleeve, and safe enough,"
25252,A TRUE STORY.,There comes some unexpected stroke
25253,A TRUE STORY.,And hangs a weeper on the cuff!
25254,A TRUE STORY.,
25255,A TRUE STORY.,"Hunks had not whistled half a mile,"
25256,A TRUE STORY.,"When, planted right against a stile,"
25257,A TRUE STORY.,"There stood his foeman, Mike Mahoney,"
25258,A TRUE STORY.,"A vagrant reaper, Irish born,"
25259,A TRUE STORY.,"That helped to reap our miser's corn,"
25260,A TRUE STORY.,"But had not helped to reap his money,"
25261,A TRUE STORY.,A fact that Hunks remembered quickly;
25262,A TRUE STORY.,"His whistle all at once was quelled,"
25263,A TRUE STORY.,And when he saw how Michael held
25264,A TRUE STORY.,"His sickle, he felt rather sickly."
25265,A TRUE STORY.,
25266,A TRUE STORY.,"Nine souls in ten, with half his fright,"
25267,A TRUE STORY.,"Would soon have paid the bill at sight,"
25268,A TRUE STORY.,But misers (let observers watch it)
25269,A TRUE STORY.,Will never part with their delight
25270,A TRUE STORY.,Till well demanded by a hatchet--
25271,A TRUE STORY.,They live hard--and they die to match it.
25272,A TRUE STORY.,"Thus Hunks prepared for Mike's attacking,"
25273,A TRUE STORY.,"Resolved not yet to pay the debt,"
25274,A TRUE STORY.,But let him take it out in hacking;
25275,A TRUE STORY.,"However, Mike began to stickle"
25276,A TRUE STORY.,In words before he used the sickle;
25277,A TRUE STORY.,But mercy was not long attendant:
25278,A TRUE STORY.,"From words at last he took to blows,"
25279,A TRUE STORY.,"And aimed a cut at Hunks's nose,"
25280,A TRUE STORY.,That made it what some folks are not--
25281,A TRUE STORY.,A member very independent.
25282,A TRUE STORY.,
25283,A TRUE STORY.,Heaven knows how far this cruel trick
25284,A TRUE STORY.,"Might still have led, but for a tramper"
25285,A TRUE STORY.,"That came in danger's very nick,"
25286,A TRUE STORY.,To put Mahoney to the scamper.
25287,A TRUE STORY.,But still compassion met a damper;
25288,A TRUE STORY.,"There lay the severed nose, alas!"
25289,A TRUE STORY.,"Beside the daisies on the grass,"
25290,A TRUE STORY.,"""Wee, crimson-tipt"" as well as they,"
25291,A TRUE STORY.,According to the poet's lay:
25292,A TRUE STORY.,"And there stood Hunks, no sight for laughter."
25293,A TRUE STORY.,"Away went Hodge to get assistance,"
25294,A TRUE STORY.,"With nose in hand, which Hunks ran after,"
25295,A TRUE STORY.,But somewhat at unusual distance.
25296,A TRUE STORY.,In many a little country place
25297,A TRUE STORY.,It is a very common case
25298,A TRUE STORY.,"To have but one residing doctor,"
25299,A TRUE STORY.,Whose practice rather seems to be
25300,A TRUE STORY.,"No practice, but a rule of three,"
25301,A TRUE STORY.,Physician--surgeon--drug-decoctor;
25302,A TRUE STORY.,
25303,A TRUE STORY.,Thus Hunks was forced to go once more
25304,A TRUE STORY.,Where he had ta'en his to t' before.
25305,A TRUE STORY.,"His mere name made the learned man hot,--"
25306,A TRUE STORY.,"""What! Hunks again within my door!"
25307,A TRUE STORY.,"I'll pull his nose""; quoth Hunks, ""You cannot."""
25308,A TRUE STORY.,The doctor looked and saw the case
25309,A TRUE STORY.,Plain as the nose _not_ on his face.
25310,A TRUE STORY.,"""Oh! hum--ha--yes--I understand."""
25311,A TRUE STORY.,"But then arose a long demur,"
25312,A TRUE STORY.,For not a finger would he stir
25313,A TRUE STORY.,Till he was paid his fee in hand;
25314,A TRUE STORY.,"That matter settled, there they were,"
25315,A TRUE STORY.,With Hunks well strapped upon his chair.
25316,A TRUE STORY.,
25317,A TRUE STORY.,The opening of a surgeon's job--
25318,A TRUE STORY.,"His tools, a chestful or a drawerful--"
25319,A TRUE STORY.,"Are always something very awful,"
25320,A TRUE STORY.,And give the heart the strangest throb;
25321,A TRUE STORY.,But never patient in his funks
25322,A TRUE STORY.,"Looked half so like a ghost as Hunks,"
25323,A TRUE STORY.,Or surgeon half so like a devil
25324,A TRUE STORY.,Prepared for some infernal revel:
25325,A TRUE STORY.,"His huge black eye kept rolling, rolling,"
25326,A TRUE STORY.,Just like a bolus in a box:
25327,A TRUE STORY.,"His fury seemed above controlling,"
25328,A TRUE STORY.,He bellowed like a hunted ox:
25329,A TRUE STORY.,"""Now, swindling wretch, I'll show thee how"
25330,A TRUE STORY.,We treat such cheating knaves as thou;
25331,A TRUE STORY.,Oh! sweet is this revenge to sup;
25332,A TRUE STORY.,I have thee by the nose--it's now
25333,A TRUE STORY.,"My turn--and I will turn it up."""
25334,A TRUE STORY.,
25335,A TRUE STORY.,Guess how the miser liked the scurvy
25336,A TRUE STORY.,And cruel way of venting passion;
25337,A TRUE STORY.,The snubbing folks in this new fashion
25338,A TRUE STORY.,Seemed quite to turn him topsy-turvy;
25339,A TRUE STORY.,"He uttered prayers, and groans, and curses,"
25340,A TRUE STORY.,For things had often gone amiss
25341,A TRUE STORY.,"And wrong with him before, but this"
25342,A TRUE STORY.,Would be the worst of all _reverses_!
25343,A TRUE STORY.,In fancy he beheld his snout
25344,A TRUE STORY.,Turned upwards like a pitcher's spout;
25345,A TRUE STORY.,"There was another grievance yet,"
25346,A TRUE STORY.,"And fancy did not fail to show it,"
25347,A TRUE STORY.,"That he must throw a summerset,"
25348,A TRUE STORY.,Or stand upon his head to blow it.
25349,A TRUE STORY.,
25350,A TRUE STORY.,And was there then no argument
25351,A TRUE STORY.,"To change the doctor's vile intent,"
25352,A TRUE STORY.,"And move his pity?--yes, in truth,"
25353,A TRUE STORY.,And that was--paying for the tooth.
25354,A TRUE STORY.,"""Zounds! pay for such a stump! I'd rather--"""
25355,A TRUE STORY.,"But here the menace went no farther,"
25356,A TRUE STORY.,"For with his other ways of pinching,"
25357,A TRUE STORY.,Hunks had a miser's love of snuff.
25358,A TRUE STORY.,A recollection strong enough
25359,A TRUE STORY.,To cause a very serious flinching;
25360,A TRUE STORY.,"In short, he paid and had the feature"
25361,A TRUE STORY.,Replaced as it was meant by nature;
25362,A TRUE STORY.,For tho' by this 'twas cold to handle
25363,A TRUE STORY.,"(No corpse's could have felt so horrid),"
25364,A TRUE STORY.,"And white just like an naked candle,"
25365,A TRUE STORY.,"The doctor deemed and proved it too,"
25366,A TRUE STORY.,That noses from the nose will do
25367,A TRUE STORY.,As well as noses from the forehead;
25368,A TRUE STORY.,"So, fixed by din of rag and lint,"
25369,A TRUE STORY.,The part was bandaged up and muffled.
25370,A TRUE STORY.,"The chair unfastened, Hunks rose,"
25371,A TRUE STORY.,"And shuffled off, for once unshuffled;"
25372,A TRUE STORY.,"And as he went, these words he snuffled--"
25373,A TRUE STORY.,"""Well, this _is_ 'paying thro' the nose.'"""

27354,A BLACK JOB.,"With many of those persevering ones,"

27356,A BLACK JOB.,And what might be their aim?
27357,A BLACK JOB.,To rescue Afric's sable sons from fetters--

27359,A BLACK JOB.,Of branding with hot letters--
27360,A BLACK JOB.,"Their shoulders from the cowhide's bloody strokes,"

27362,A BLACK JOB.,"To end or mitigate the ills of slavery,"

27382,A BLACK JOB.,"They look'd like Devils, tho' they sang like Saints!"
27383,A BLACK JOB.,The thing was undeniable!
27384,A BLACK JOB.,They wanted washing! not that slight ablution
27385,A BLACK JOB.,"To which the skin of the White Man is liable,"
27386,A BLACK JOB.,Merely removing transient pollution--
27387,A BLACK JOB.,"But good, hard, honest, energetic rubbing"

27389,A BLACK JOB.,Sousing each sooty frame from heels to head
27390,A BLACK JOB.,"With stiff, strong, saponaceous lather,"
27391,A BLACK JOB.,"And pails of water--hottish rather,"
27392,A BLACK JOB.,But not so boiling as to turn 'em red!

27394,A BLACK JOB.,So spoke the philanthropic man

27410,A BLACK JOB.,"One thing was requisite, and that was--money!"

28877,PART I,"Instead of tending at all to pale,"
28878,PART I,Like cheeks that feel the chill of affright--
28879,PART I,Remains the very reverse of white!
28880,PART I,
28881,PART I,His heart is granite--his iron nerve
28882,PART I,Feels no convulsive twitches;
28883,PART I,"And as to his foot, it does not swerve,"
28884,PART I,Tho' the Screech-Owls are flitting about him that serve
28885,PART I,For parrots to Brocken Witches!
28886,PART I,
28887,PART I,"Nay, full in his very path he spies"
28888,PART I,The gleam of the Were Wolf's horrid eyes;
28889,PART I,But if his members quiver--
28890,PART I,"It is not for _that_--no, it is not for _that_--"
28891,PART I,"Nor rat,"
28892,PART I,"Nor cat,"
28893,PART I,"As black as your hat,"
28894,PART I,"Nor the snake that hiss'd, nor the toad that spat,"
28895,PART I,"Nor glimmering candles of dead men's fat,"
28896,PART I,"Nor even the flap of the Vampire Bat,"
28897,PART I,"No anserine skin would rise thereat,"
28898,PART I,It's the cold that makes _Him_ shiver!
28899,PART I,
28900,PART I,"So down, still down, through gully and glen,"
28901,PART I,"Never trodden by foot of men,"
28902,PART I,"Past the Eagle's nest and the She-Wolf's den,"
28903,PART I,Never caring a jot how steep
28904,PART I,"Or how narrow the track he has to keep,"
28905,PART I,Or how wide and deep
28906,PART I,"An abyss to leap,"
28907,PART I,"Or what may fly, or walk, or creep,"
28908,PART I,"Down he hurries through darkness and storm,"
28909,PART I,Flapping his arms to keep him warm--
28910,PART I,"Till threading many a pass abhorrent,"
28911,PART I,"At last he reaches the mountain gorge,"
28912,PART I,And takes a path along by a torrent--
28913,PART I,"The very identical path, by St. George!"
28914,PART I,
28915,PART I,"Down which young Fridolin went to the Forge,"
28916,PART I,With a message meant for his own death-warrant!
28917,PART I,
28918,PART I,Young Fridolin! young Fridolin!
28919,PART I,"So free from sauce, and sloth, and sin,"
28920,PART I,The best of pages
28921,PART I,"Whatever their ages,"
28922,PART I,Since first that singular fashion came in--
28923,PART I,Not he like those modern and idle young gluttons
28924,PART I,"With little jackets, so smart and spruce,"
28925,PART I,"Of Lincoln green, sky-blue, or puce--"
28926,PART I,A little gold lace you may introduce--
28927,PART I,"Very showy, but as for use,"
28928,PART I,Not worth so many buttons!
28929,PART I,
28930,PART I,Young Fridolin! young Fridolin!
28931,PART I,Of his duty so true a fulfiller--
28932,PART I,But here we need no farther go
28933,PART I,"For whoever desires the Tale to know,"
28934,PART I,May read it all in Schiller.
28935,PART I,
28936,PART I,"Faster now the Traveller speeds,"
28937,PART I,Whither his guiding beacon leads.
28938,PART I,For by yonder glare
28939,PART I,"In the murky air,"
28940,PART I,He knows that the Eisen Hutte is there!
28941,PART I,"With its sooty Cyclops, savage and grim"
28942,PART I,"Hosts, a guest had better forbear,"
28943,PART I,Whose thoughts are set upon dainty fare--
28944,PART I,"But stiff with cold in every limb,"
28945,PART I,The Furnace Fire is the bait for _Him_!
28946,PART I,
28947,PART I,Faster and faster still he goes.
28948,PART I,"Whilst redder and redder the welkin glows,"
28949,PART I,And the lowest clouds that scud in the sky
28950,PART I,Get crimson fringes in flitting by.
28951,PART I,"Till lo! amid the lurid light,"
28952,PART I,"The darkest object intensely dark,"
28953,PART I,"Just where the bright is intensely bright,"
28954,PART I,"The Forge, the Forge itself is in sight,"
28955,PART I,"Like the pitch-black hull of a burning bark,"
28956,PART I,"With volleying smoke, and many a spark,"
28957,PART I,"Vomiting fire, red, yellow, and white!"
28958,PART I,
28959,PART I,"Restless, quivering tongues of flame!"
28960,PART I,"Heavenward striving still to go,"
28961,PART I,"While others, reversed in the stream, below,"
28962,PART I,"Seem seeking a place we will not name,"
28963,PART I,"But well that Traveller knows the same,"
28964,PART I,"Who stops and stands,"
28965,PART I,"So rubbing his hands,"
28966,PART I,And snuffing the rare
28967,PART I,"Perfumes in the air,"
28968,PART I,"For old familiar odors are there,"
28969,PART I,"And then direct by the shortest cut,"
28970,PART I,"Like Alpine Marmot, whom neither rut,"
28971,PART I,"Rivers, rocks, nor thickets rebut,"
28972,PART I,Makes his way to the blazing Hut!
28973,PART I,
28974,PART I,
28975,PART II.,PART II.
28976,PART II.,
28977,PART II.,"Idly watching the Furnace-flames,"
28978,PART II.,The men of the stithy
28979,PART II.,"Are in their smithy,"
28980,PART II.,"Brutal monsters, with bulky frames,"
28981,PART II.,"Beings Humanity scarcely claims,"
28982,PART II.,"But hybrids rather of demon race,"
28983,PART II.,"Unbless'd by the holy rite of grace,"
28984,PART II.,"Who never had gone by Christian names,"
28985,PART II.,"Mark, or Matthew, Peter, or James--"
28986,PART II.,"Naked, foul, unshorn, unkempt,"
28987,PART II.,"From touch of natural shame exempt,"
28988,PART II.,Things of which Delirium has dreamt--
28989,PART II.,"But wherefore dwell on these verbal sketches,"
28990,PART II.,"When traced with frightful truth and vigor,"
28991,PART II.,"Costume, attitude, face, and figure,"
28992,PART II.,Retsch has drawn the very wretches!
28993,PART II.,
28994,PART II.,"However, there they lounge about,"
28995,PART II.,"The grim, gigantic fellows,"
28996,PART II.,"Hardly hearing the storm without,"
28997,PART II.,"That makes so very dreadful a rout,"
28998,PART II.,For the constant roar
28999,PART II.,From the furnace door.
29000,PART II.,And the blast of the monstrous bellows!
29001,PART II.,
29002,PART II.,"Oh, what a scene"
29003,PART II.,That Forge had been
29004,PART II.,For Salvator Rosa's study!
29005,PART II.,"With wall, and beam, and post, and pin,"
29006,PART II.,"And those ruffianly creatures, like Shapes of Sin,"
29007,PART II.,"Hair, and eyes, and rusty skin,"
29008,PART II.,Illumed by a light so ruddy
29009,PART II.,"The Hut, and whatever there is therein,"
29010,PART II.,Looks either red-hot or bloody!
29011,PART II.,
29012,PART II.,"And, oh! to hear the frequent burst"
29013,PART II.,"Of strange, extravagant laughter,"
29014,PART II.,"Harsh and hoarse,"
29015,PART II.,And resounding perforce
29016,PART II.,From echoing roof and rafter!
29017,PART II.,"Though curses, the worst"
29018,PART II.,"That ever were curst,"
29019,PART II.,"And threats that Cain invented the first,"
29020,PART II.,Come growling the instant after!
29021,PART II.,
29022,PART II.,"But again the livelier peal is rung,"
29023,PART II.,"For the Smith, hight Salamander,"
29024,PART II.,"In the jargon of some Titanic tongue,"
29025,PART II.,"Elsewhere never said or sung,"
29026,PART II.,With the voice of a Stentor in joke has flung
29027,PART II.,Some cumbrous sort
29028,PART II.,Of sledge-hammer retort
29029,PART II.,"At Red Beard, the crew's commander."
29030,PART II.,
29031,PART II.,"Some frightful jest--who knows how wild,"
29032,PART II.,"Or obscene, from a monster so defiled,"
29033,PART II.,"And a horrible mouth, of such extent,"
29034,PART II.,"From flapping ear to ear it went,"
29035,PART II.,And show'd such tusks whenever it smiled--
29036,PART II.,The very mouth to devour a child!
29037,PART II.,
29038,PART II.,But fair or foul the jest gives birth
29039,PART II.,"To another bellow of demon mirth,"
29040,PART II.,"That far outroars the weather,"
29041,PART II.,As if all the Hyænas that prowl the earth
29042,PART II.,Had clubb'd their laughs together!
29043,PART II.,
29044,PART II.,"And lo! in the middle of all the din,"
29045,PART II.,"Not seeming to care a single pin,"
29046,PART II.,"For a prospect so volcanic,"
29047,PART II.,"A Stranger steps abruptly in,"
29048,PART II.,Of an aspect rather Satanic:
29049,PART II.,"And he looks with a grin at those Cyclops grim,"
29050,PART II.,Who stare and grin again at him
29051,PART II.,With wondrous little panic.
29052,PART II.,
29053,PART II.,"Then up to the Furnace the Stranger goes,"
29054,PART II.,"Eager to thaw his ears and nose,"
29055,PART II.,And warm his frozen fingers and toes--
29056,PART II.,"While each succeeding minute,"
29057,PART II.,"Hotter and hotter the Smithy grows,"
29058,PART II.,"And seems to declare,"
29059,PART II.,"By a fiercer glare,"
29060,PART II.,"On wall, roof, floor, and everywhere,"
29061,PART II.,It knows the Devil is in it!
29062,PART II.,
29063,PART II.,Still not a word
29064,PART II.,"Is utter'd or heard,"
29065,PART II.,"But the beetle-brow'd Foreman nods and winks,"
29066,PART II.,"Much as a shaggy old Lion blinks,"
29067,PART II.,And makes a shift
29068,PART II.,To impart his drift
29069,PART II.,"To a smoky brother, who, joining the links,"
29070,PART II.,Hints to a third the thing he thinks;
29071,PART II.,"And whatever it be,"
29072,PART II.,They all agree
29073,PART II.,"In smiling with faces full of glee,"
29074,PART II.,As if about to enjoy High Jinks.
29075,PART II.,
29076,PART II.,What sort of tricks they mean to play
29077,PART II.,"By way of diversion, who can say,"
29078,PART II.,"Of such ferocious and barbarous folk,"
29079,PART II.,"Who chuckled, indeed, and never spoke"
29080,PART II.,"Of burning Robert the Jäger to coke,"
29081,PART II.,Except as a capital practical joke!
29082,PART II.,"Who never thought of Mercy, or heard her,"
29083,PART II.,Or any gentle emotion felt;
29084,PART II.,"But hard as the iron they had to melt,"
29085,PART II.,Sported with Danger and romp'd with Murder!
29086,PART II.,
29087,PART II.,Meanwhile the Stranger--
29088,PART II.,"The Brocken Ranger,"
29089,PART II.,"Besides another and hotter post,"
29090,PART II.,"That renders him not averse to a roast,--"
29091,PART II.,"Creeping into the Furnace almost,"
29092,PART II.,Has made himself as warm as a toast--
29093,PART II.,"When, unsuspicious of any danger,"
29094,PART II.,And least of all of any such maggot
29095,PART II.,"As treating a body like a faggot,"
29096,PART II.,All at once he is seized and shoven
29097,PART II.,"In pastime cruel,"
29098,PART II.,"Like so much fuel,"
29099,PART II.,Headlong into the blazing oven!
29100,PART II.,
29101,PART II.,In he goes! with a frightful shout
29102,PART II.,"Mock'd by the rugged ruffianly band,"
29103,PART II.,"As round the Furnace mouth they stand,"
29104,PART II.,"Bar, and shovel, and ladle in hand,"
29105,PART II.,"To hinder their Butt from crawling out,"
29106,PART II.,"Who making one fierce attempt, but vain,"
29107,PART II.,Receives such a blow
29108,PART II.,From Red-Beard's crow
29109,PART II.,"As crashes the skull and gashes the brain,"
29110,PART II.,"And blind, and dizzy, and stunn'd with pain,"
29111,PART II.,"With merely an interjectional ""oh!"""
29112,PART II.,Back he rolls in the flames again.
29113,PART II.,
29114,PART II.,"""Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!"" That second fall"
29115,PART II.,"Seerns the very best joke of all,"
29116,PART II.,"To judge by the roar,"
29117,PART II.,"Twice as loud as before,"
29118,PART II.,"That fills the Hut, from the roof to the floor,"
29119,PART II.,"And flies a league or two out of the door,"
29120,PART II.,Up the mountains and over the moor--
29121,PART II.,But scarcely the jolly echoes they wake
29122,PART II.,Have well begun
29123,PART II.,"To take up the fun,"
29124,PART II.,"Ere the shaggy Felons have cause to quake,"
29125,PART II.,"And begin to feel that the deed they have done,"
29126,PART II.,"Instead of being a pleasant one,"
29127,PART II.,Was a very great error--and no mistake.
29128,PART II.,
29129,PART II.,For why?--in lieu
29130,PART II.,"Of its former hue,"
29131,PART II.,"So natural, warm, and florid,"
29132,PART II.,"The Furnace burns of a brimstone blue,"
29133,PART II.,"And instead of the _couleur de rose_ it threw,"
29134,PART II.,"With a cooler reflection,--justly due--"
29135,PART II.,"Exhibits each of the Pagan crew,"
29136,PART II.,"Livid, ghastly, and horrid!"
29137,PART II.,But vainly they close their guilty eyes
29138,PART II.,Against prophetic fears;
29139,PART II.,Or with hard and horny palms devise
29140,PART II.,To dam their enormous ears--
29141,PART II.,"There are sounds in the air,"
29142,PART II.,"Not here or there,"
29143,PART II.,"Irresistible voices everywhere,"
29144,PART II.,"No bulwarks can ever rebut,"
29145,PART II.,And to match the screams
29146,PART II.,"Tremendous gleams,"
29147,PART II.,"Of Horrors that like the Phantoms of dreams,"
29148,PART II.,They see with their eyelids shut!
29149,PART II.,"For awful coveys of terrible things,"
29150,PART II.,"With forked tongues and venomous stings,"
29151,PART II.,"On hagweed, broomsticks, and leathern wings,"
29152,PART II.,Are hovering round the Hut!
29153,PART II.,
29154,PART II.,"Shapes, that within the focus bright"
29155,PART II.,"Of the Forge, are like shadows and blots;"
29156,PART II.,"But farther off, in the shades of night,"
29157,PART II.,"Clothed with their own phosphoric light,"
29158,PART II.,Are seen in the darkest spots.
29159,PART II.,
29160,PART II.,"Sounds! that fill the air with noises,"
29161,PART II.,"Strange and indescribable voices,"
29162,PART II.,"From Hags, in a diabolical clatter--"
29163,PART II.,"Cats that spit curses, and apes that chatter"
29164,PART II.,Scraps of cabalistical matter--
29165,PART II.,"Owls that screech, and dogs that yell--"
29166,PART II.,Skeleton hounds that will never be fatter--
29167,PART II.,"All the domestic tribes of Hell,"
29168,PART II.,"Shrieking for flesh to tear and tatter,"
29169,PART II.,"Bones to shatter,"
29170,PART II.,"And limbs to scatter,"
29171,PART II.,And who it is that must furnish the latter
29172,PART II.,Those blue-looking Men know well!
29173,PART II.,"Those blue-looking men that huddle together,"
29174,PART II.,For all their sturdy limbs and thews
29175,PART II.,"Their unshorn locks, like Nazarene Jews,"
29176,PART II.,"And buffalo beards, and hides of leather,"
29177,PART II.,"Huddled all in a heap together,"
29178,PART II.,"Like timid lamb, and ewe, and wether,"
29179,PART II.,"And as females say,"
29180,PART II.,"In a similar way,"
29181,PART II.,Fit for knocking down with a feather!
29182,PART II.,
29183,PART II.,"In and out, in and out,"
29184,PART II.,"The gathering Goblins hover about,"
29185,PART II.,Ev'ry minute augmenting the rout;
29186,PART II.,For like a spell
29187,PART II.,The unearthly smell
29188,PART II.,"That fumes from the Furnace, chimney and mouth,"
29189,PART II.,Draws them in--an infernal Legion
29190,PART II.,"From East, and West, and North, and South,"
29191,PART II.,"Like carrion birds from ev'ry region,"
29192,PART II.,Till not a yard square
29193,PART II.,Of the sickening air
29194,PART II.,"But has a Demon or two for its share,"
29195,PART II.,"Breathing fury, woe, and despair,"
29196,PART II.,"Never, never was such a sight!"
29197,PART II.,"It beats the very Walpurgis Night,"
29198,PART II.,"Displayed in the story of Doctor Faustus,"
29199,PART II.,For the scene to describe
29200,PART II.,"Of the awful tribe,"
29201,PART II.,"If we were _two_ Göthes, would quite exhaust us!"
29202,PART II.,
29203,PART II.,"Suffice it, amid that dreary swarm,"
29204,PART II.,There musters each foul repulsive form
29205,PART II.,That ever a fancy overwarm
29206,PART II.,Begot in its worst delirium;
29207,PART II.,"Besides some others of monstrous size,"
29208,PART II.,"Never before revealed to eyes,"
29209,PART II.,Of the genus Megatherium!
29210,PART II.,
29211,PART II.,"Meanwhile the demons, filthy and foul,"
29212,PART II.,"Gorgon, Chimera, Harpy, and Ghoul,"
29213,PART II.,Are not contented to jibber and howl
29214,PART II.,As a dirge for their late commander;
29215,PART II.,"But one of the bevy--witch or wizard,"
29216,PART II.,"Disguised as a monstrous flying lizard,"
29217,PART II.,"Springs on the grisly Salamander,"
29218,PART II.,"Who stoutly fights, and struggles, and kicks."
29219,PART II.,"And tries the best of his wrestling tricks,"
29220,PART II.,"No paltry strife,"
29221,PART II.,"But for life, dear life."
29222,PART II.,"But the ruthless talons refuse to unfix,"
29223,PART II.,"Till far beyond a surgical case,"
29224,PART II.,"With starting eyes, and black in the face,"
29225,PART II.,Down he tumbles as dead as bricks!
29226,PART II.,
29227,PART II.,A pretty sight for his mates to view!
29228,PART II.,"Those shaggy murderers looking so blue,"
29229,PART II.,"And for him above all,"
29230,PART II.,"Red-bearded and tall,"
29231,PART II.,"With whom, at that very particular nick,"
29232,PART II.,"There is such an unlucky crow to pick,"
29233,PART II.,As the one of iron that did the trick
29234,PART II.,In a recent bloody affair--
29235,PART II.,"No wonder feeling a little sick,"
29236,PART II.,"With pulses beating uncommonly quick,"
29237,PART II.,"And breath he never found so thick,"
29238,PART II.,He longs for the open air!
29239,PART II.,
29240,PART II.,"Three paces, or four,"
29241,PART II.,And he gains the door;
29242,PART II.,"But ere he accomplishes one,"
29243,PART II.,"The sound of a blow comes, heavy and dull,"
29244,PART II.,And clasping his fingers round his skull--
29245,PART II.,"However the deed was done,"
29246,PART II.,That gave him that florid
29247,PART II.,Red gash on the forehead--
29248,PART II.,"With a roll of the eyeballs perfectly horrid,"
29249,PART II.,"There's a tremulous quiver,"
29250,PART II.,"The last death-shiver,"
29251,PART II.,And Red-Beard's course is run!
29252,PART II.,
29253,PART II.,Halloo! Halloo!
29254,PART II.,They have done for two!
29255,PART II.,But a heavyish job remains to do!
29256,PART II.,"For yonder, sledge and shovel in hand,"
29257,PART II.,"Like elder Sons of Giant Despair,"
29258,PART II.,"A couple of Cyclops make a stand,"
29259,PART II.,"And fiercely hammering here and there,"
29260,PART II.,Keep at bay the Powers of Air--
29261,PART II.,But desperation is all in vain!--
29262,PART II.,"They faint--they choke,"
29263,PART II.,For the sulphurous smoke
29264,PART II.,"Is poisoning heart, and lung, and brain,"
29265,PART II.,"They reel, they sink, they gasp, they smother."
29266,PART II.,"One for a moment survives his brother,"
29267,PART II.,Then rolls a corpse across the other!
29268,PART II.,
29269,PART II.,Halloo! Halloo!
29270,PART II.,And Hullabaloo!
29271,PART II.,There is only one more thing to do--
29272,PART II.,"And seized by beak, and talon, and claw,"
29273,PART II.,"Bony hand, and hairy paw,"
29274,PART II.,"Yea, crooked horn, and tusky jaw,"
29275,PART II.,The four huge Bodies are haul'd and shoven
29276,PART II.,Each after each in the roaring oven!
29277,PART II.,
29278,PART II.,*       *       *       *       *
29279,PART II.,
29280,PART II.,"That Eisen Hutte is standing still,"
29281,PART II.,"Go to the Hartz whenever you will,"
29282,PART II.,"And there it is beside a hill,"
29283,PART II.,And a rapid stream that turns many a mill;
29284,PART II.,"The self-same Forge,--you'll know it at sight--"
29285,PART II.,"Casting upward, day and night,"
29286,PART II.,"Flames of red, and yellow, and white!"
29287,PART II.,
29288,PART II.,"Ay, half a mile from the mountain gorge,"
29289,PART II.,"There it is, the famous Forge,"
29290,PART II.,"With its Furnace,--the same that blazed of yore,--"
29291,PART II.,Hugely fed with fuel and ore;
29292,PART II.,"But ever since that tremendous Revel,"
29293,PART II.,"Whatever Iron is melted therein,--"
29294,PART II.,As Travellers know who have been to Berlin--
29295,PART II.,Is all _as black as the Devil_!

29300,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45]
29301,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29302,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"""A plague o' both the houses!""--MERCUTIO."
29303,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29304,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"[Footnote 45: ""The Row at the Oxford Arms"" (to quote its alternative"
29305,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"title) is a squib on the contest at Oxford, in 1841-42, for the"
29306,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Professorship of Poetry. The candidates, it will be remembered, were"
29307,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Isaac Williams and Mr. (afterwards Archdeacon) Garbett. The struggle
29308,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],was the more intense that it was openly acknowledged to be a trial of
29309,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"strength between the adherents of the ""Oxford Movement"" and the"
29310,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Evangelical Party.]
29311,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29312,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29313,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],As latterly I chanced to pass
29314,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"A Public House, from which, alas!"
29315,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],The Arms of Oxford dangle!
29316,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"My ear was startled by a din,"
29317,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"That made me tremble in my skin,"
29318,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"A dreadful hubbub from within,"
29319,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Of voices in a wrangle--
29320,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29321,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Voices loud, and voices high,"
29322,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"With now and then a party-cry,"
29323,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Such as used in times gone by
29324,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],To scare the British border;
29325,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],When foes from North and South of Tweed--
29326,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Neighbors--and of Christian creed--
29327,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Met in hate to fight and bleed,"
29328,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Upsetting Social Order.
29329,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29330,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Surprised, I turn'd me to the crowd,"
29331,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Attracted by that tumult loud,"
29332,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And ask'd a gazer, beetle-brow'd,"
29333,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],The cause of such disquiet.
29334,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"When lo! the solemn-looking man,"
29335,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"First shook his head on Burleigh's plan,"
29336,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And then, with fluent tongue, began"
29337,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],His version of the riot:
29338,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29339,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"A row!--why yes,--a pretty row, you might hear from this to Garmany,"
29340,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And what is worse, it's all got up among the Sons of Harmony,"
29341,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"The more's the shame for them as used to be in time and tune,"
29342,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],And all unite in chorus like the singing-birds in June!
29343,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Ah! many a pleasant chant I've heard in passing here along,"
29344,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],When Swiveller was President a-knocking down a song;
29345,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"But Dick's resign'd the post, you see, and all them shouts and hollers"
29346,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Is 'cause two other candidates, some sort of larned scholars,"
29347,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Are squabbling to be Chairman of the Glorious Apollers!
29348,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29349,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Lord knows their names, I'm sure I don't, no more than any yokel,"
29350,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],But I never heard of either as connected with the vocal;
29351,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Nay, some do say, although of course the public rumor varies,"
29352,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],They've no more warble in 'em than a pair of hen canaries;
29353,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Though that might pass if they were dabs at t'other sort of thing,"
29354,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"For a man may make a song, you know, although he cannot sing;"
29355,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"But lork! it's many folk's belief they're only good at prosing,"
29356,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],For Catnach swears he never saw a verse of their composing;
29357,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And when a piece of poetry has stood its public trials,"
29358,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"If pop'lar, it gets printed off at once in Seven Dials,"
29359,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And then about all sorts of streets, by every little monkey,"
29360,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"It's chanted like the ""Dog's Meat Man,"" or ""If I had a Donkey."""
29361,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Whereas, as Mr. Catnach says, and not a bad judge neither,"
29362,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"No ballad--worth a ha'penny--has ever come from either,"
29363,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And him as writ ""Jim Crow,"" he says, and got such lots of dollars,"
29364,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Would make a better Chairman for the Glorious Apollers.
29365,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Howsomever that's the meaning of the squabble that arouses
29366,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"This neighborhood, and quite disturbs all decent Heads of Houses,"
29367,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Who want to have their dinners and their parties, as is reason,"
29368,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],In Christian peace and charity according to the season.
29369,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"But from Number Thirty-Nine--since this electioneering job,"
29370,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Ay, as far as Number Ninety, there's an everlasting mob;"
29371,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Till the thing is quite a nuisance, for no creature passes by,"
29372,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"But he gets a card, a pamphlet, or a summut in his eye;"
29373,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And a pretty noise there is!--what with canvassers and spouters,"
29374,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],For in course each side is furnish'd with its backers and its touters;
29375,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And surely among the Clergy to such pitches it is carried,"
29376,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],You can hardly find a Parson to get buried or get married;
29377,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Or supposing any accident that suddenly alarms,"
29378,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"If you're dying for a surgeon, you must fetch him from the ""Arms"";"
29379,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"While the Schoolmasters and Tooters are neglecting of their scholars,"
29380,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],To write about a Chairman for the Glorious Apollers.
29381,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29382,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Well, that, sir, is the racket; and the more the sin and shame"
29383,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Of them that help to stir it up, and propagate the same;"
29384,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Instead of vocal ditties, and the social flowing cup,--"
29385,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"But they'll be the House's ruin, or the shutting of it up,"
29386,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"With their riots and their hubbubs, like a garden full of bears,"
29387,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"While they've damaged many articles and broken lots of squares,"
29388,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And kept their noble Club Room in a perfect dust and smother,"
29389,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"By throwing _Morning Heralds_, _Times_, and _Standards_ at each other;"
29390,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Not to name the ugly language Gemmen oughtn't to repeat,"
29391,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],And the names they call each other--for I've heard 'em in the street--
29392,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Such as Traitors, Guys, and Judasses, and Vipers and what not,"
29393,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],For Pasley and his divers ain't so blowing-up a lot.
29394,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],And then such awful swearing!--for there's one of them that cusses
29395,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Enough to shock the cads that hang on opposition 'busses;
29396,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"For he cusses every member that's agin him at the poll,"
29397,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"As I wouldn't cuss a donkey, tho' it hasn't got a soul;"
29398,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And he cusses all their families, Jack, Harry, Bob or Jim,"
29399,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"To the babby in the cradle, if they don't agree with him."
29400,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Whereby, altho' as yet they have not took to use their fives,"
29401,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Or, according as the fashion is, to sticking with their knives,"
29402,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"I'm bound they'll be some milling yet, and shakings by the collars,"
29403,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Afore they choose a Chairman for the Glorious Apollers!
29404,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29405,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"To be sure it is a pity to be blowing such a squall,"
29406,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Instead of clouds, and every man his song, and then his call--"
29407,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And as if there wasn't Whigs enough and Tories to fall out,"
29408,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Besides polities in plenty for our splits to be about,--"
29409,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Why, a cornfield is sufficient, sir, as anybody knows,"
29410,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],For to furnish them in plenty who are fond of picking crows--
29411,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Not to name the Maynooth Catholics, and other Irish stews,"
29412,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],To agitate society and loosen all its screws;
29413,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And which all may be agreeable and proper to their spheres,--"
29414,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],But it's not the thing for musicals to set us by the ears.
29415,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And as to College larning, my opinion for to broach,"
29416,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And I've had it from my cousin, and he driv a college coach,"
29417,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And so knows the University, and all as there belongs,"
29418,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And he says that Oxford's famouser for sausages than songs,"
29419,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And seldom turns a poet out like Hudson that can chant,"
29420,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"As well as make such ditties as the Free and Easies want,"
29421,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Or other Tavern Melodists I can't just call to mind--
29422,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"But it's not the classic system for to propagate the kind,"
29423,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Whereby it so may happen as that neither of them Scholars
29424,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],May be the proper Chairman for the Glorious Apollers!
29425,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29426,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"For my part in the matter, if so be I had a voice,"
29427,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],It's the best among the vocalists I'd honor with the choice;
29428,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Or a Poet as could furnish a new Ballad to the bunch;
29429,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Or at any rate the surest hand at mixing of the punch;
29430,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"'Cause why, the members meet for that and other tuneful frolics--"
29431,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And not to say, like Muffincaps, their Catichiz and Collec's."
29432,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"But you see them there Itinerants that preach so long and loud,"
29433,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And always takes advantage like the prigs of any crowd,"
29434,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Have brought their jangling voices, and as far as they can compass,"
29435,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Have turn'd a tavern shindy to a seriouser rumpus,"
29436,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],And him as knows most hymns--altho' I can't see how it follers--
29437,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],They want to be the Chairman of the Glorious Apollers!
29438,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],
29439,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Well, that's the row--and who can guess the upshot after all?"
29440,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Whether Harmony will ever make the ""Arms"" her House of call,"
29441,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Or whether this here mobbing--as some longish heads foretell it,"
29442,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Will grow to such a riot that the Oxford Blues must quell it,"
29443,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Howsomever, for the present, there's no sign of any peace,"
29444,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"For the hubbub keeps a-growing, and defies the New Police;--"
29445,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"But if _I_ was in the Vestry, and a leading sort of Man,"
29446,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Or a Member of the Vocals, to get backers for my plan,"
29447,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Why, I'd settle all the squabble in the twinkle of a needle,"
29448,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"For I'd have another candidate--and that's the Parish Beadle,"
29449,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Who makes such lots of Poetry, himself, or else by proxy,"
29450,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],And no one never has no doubts about his orthodoxy;
29451,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"Whereby--if folks was wise--instead of either of them Scholars,"
29452,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"And straining their own lungs along of contradictious hollers,"
29453,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],"They'll lend their ears to reason, and take my advice as follers,"
29454,THE UNIVERSITY FEUD.[45],Namely--Bumble for the Chairman of the Glorious Apollers!
