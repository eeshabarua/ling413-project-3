45,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),
46,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),
47,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),Not with an outcry to Allah nor any complaining
48,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),He answered his name at the muster and stood to the chaining.
49,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),"When the twin anklets were nipped on the leg-bars that held them,"
50,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),He brotherly greeted the armourers stooping to weld them.
51,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),"Ere the sad dust of the marshalled feet of the chain-gang swallowed him,"
52,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),"Observing him nobly at ease, I alighted and followed him."
53,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),"Thus we had speech by the way, but not touching his sorrow"
54,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),"Rather his red Yesterday and his regal To-morrow,"
55,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),"Wherein he statelily moved to the clink of his chains unregarded,"
56,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),Nowise abashed but contented to drink of the potion awarded.
57,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),"Saluting aloofly his Fate, he made swift with his story;"
58,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),And the words of his mouth were as slaves spreading carpets of glory
59,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),Embroidered with names of the Djinns—a miraculous weaving—
60,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),But the cool and perspicuous eye overbore unbelieving.
61,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),So I submitted myself to the limits of rapture—
62,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),"Bound by this man we had bound, amid captives his capture—"
63,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),Till he returned me to earth and the visions departed;
64,FROM THE MASJID-AL-AQSA OF SAYYID AHMED (WAHABI),But on him be the Peace and the Blessing: for he was great-hearted!

72,THE CAPTIVE,“He that believeth shall not make haste.”—_Isaiah_.
73,THE CAPTIVE,
74,THE CAPTIVE,
75,THE CAPTIVE,"The guard-boat lay across the mouth of the bathing-pool, her crew idly"
76,THE CAPTIVE,spanking the water with the flat of their oars. A red-coated
77,THE CAPTIVE,"militia-man, rifle in hand, sat at the bows, and a petty officer at the"
78,THE CAPTIVE,"stern. Between the snow-white cutter and the flat-topped,"
79,THE CAPTIVE,honey-coloured rocks on the beach the green water was troubled with
80,THE CAPTIVE,shrimp-pink prisoners-of-war bathing. Behind their orderly tin camp and
81,THE CAPTIVE,the electric-light poles rose those stone-dotted spurs that throw heat
82,THE CAPTIVE,on Simonstown. Beneath them the little _Barracouta_ nodded to the big
83,THE CAPTIVE,"_Gibraltar_, and the old _Penelope_, that in ten years has been"
84,THE CAPTIVE,"bachelors’ club, natural history museum, kindergarten, and prison,"
85,THE CAPTIVE,"rooted and dug at her fixed moorings. Far out, a three-funnelled"
86,THE CAPTIVE,Atlantic transport with turtle bow and stern waddled in from the deep
87,THE CAPTIVE,sea.
88,THE CAPTIVE,
89,THE CAPTIVE,"Said the sentry, assured of the visitor’s good faith, “Talk to ’em? You"
90,THE CAPTIVE,"can, to any that speak English. You’ll find a lot that do.”"
91,THE CAPTIVE,
92,THE CAPTIVE,Here and there earnest groups gathered round ministers of the Dutch
93,THE CAPTIVE,"Reformed Church, who doubtless preached conciliation, but the majority"
94,THE CAPTIVE,preferred their bath. The God who Looks after Small Things had caused
95,THE CAPTIVE,the visitor that day to receive two weeks’ delayed mails in one from a
96,THE CAPTIVE,"casual postman, and the whole heavy bundle of newspapers, tied with a"
97,THE CAPTIVE,"strap, he dangled as bait. At the edge of the beach, cross-legged,"
98,THE CAPTIVE,"undressed to his sky-blue army shirt, sat a lean, ginger-haired man, on"
99,THE CAPTIVE,guard over a dozen heaps of clothing. His eyes followed the incoming
100,THE CAPTIVE,Atlantic boat.
101,THE CAPTIVE,
102,THE CAPTIVE,"“Excuse me, Mister,” he said, without turning (and the speech betrayed"
103,THE CAPTIVE,"his nationality), “would you mind keeping away from these garments?"
104,THE CAPTIVE,I’ve been elected janitor—on the Dutch vote.”
105,THE CAPTIVE,
106,THE CAPTIVE,The visitor moved over against the barbed-wire fence and sat down to
107,THE CAPTIVE,his mail. At the rustle of the newspaper-wrappers the ginger-coloured
108,THE CAPTIVE,"man turned quickly, the hunger of a press-ridden people in his"
109,THE CAPTIVE,close-set iron-grey eyes.
110,THE CAPTIVE,
111,THE CAPTIVE,“Have you any use for papers?” said the visitor.
112,THE CAPTIVE,
113,THE CAPTIVE,"“Have I any use?” A quick, curved forefinger was already snicking off"
114,THE CAPTIVE,"the outer covers. “Why, that’s the New York postmark! Give me the ads."
115,THE CAPTIVE,at the back of _Harper’s_ and _M’Clure’s_ and I’m in touch with God’s
116,THE CAPTIVE,Country again! Did you know how I was aching for papers?”
117,THE CAPTIVE,
118,THE CAPTIVE,The visitor told the tale of the casual postman.
119,THE CAPTIVE,
120,THE CAPTIVE,"“Providential!” said the ginger-coloured man, keen as a terrier on his"
121,THE CAPTIVE,task; “both in time and matter. Yes! … The _Scientific American_ yet
122,THE CAPTIVE,"once more! Oh, it’s good! it’s good!” His voice broke as he pressed his"
123,THE CAPTIVE,hawk-like nose against the heavily-inked patent-specifications at the
124,THE CAPTIVE,end. “Can I keep it? I thank you—I thank you! Why—why—well—well! The
125,THE CAPTIVE,_American Tyler_ of all things created! Do you subscribe to that?”
126,THE CAPTIVE,
127,THE CAPTIVE,"“I’m on the free list,” said the visitor, nodding."
128,THE CAPTIVE,
129,THE CAPTIVE,He extended his blue-tanned hand with that air of Oriental spaciousness
130,THE CAPTIVE,"which distinguishes the native-born American, and met the visitor’s"
131,THE CAPTIVE,grasp expertly. “I can only say that you have treated me like a Brother
132,THE CAPTIVE,"(yes, I’ll take every last one you can spare), and if ever—” He plucked"
133,THE CAPTIVE,at the bosom of his shirt. “Psha! I forgot I’d no card on me; but my
134,THE CAPTIVE,name’s Zigler—Laughton G. Zigler. An American? If Ohio’s still in the
135,THE CAPTIVE,"Union, I am, Sir. But I’m no extreme States’-rights man. I’ve used all"
136,THE CAPTIVE,"of my native country and a few others as I have found occasion, and now"
137,THE CAPTIVE,I am the captive of your bow and spear. I’m not kicking at that. I am
138,THE CAPTIVE,"not a coerced alien, nor a naturalised Texas mule-tender, nor an"
139,THE CAPTIVE,adventurer on the instalment plan. _I_ don’t tag after our consul when
140,THE CAPTIVE,"he comes around, expecting the American Eagle to lift me out o’ this by"
141,THE CAPTIVE,"the slack of my pants. No, sir! If a Britisher went into Indian"
142,THE CAPTIVE,Territory and shot up his surroundings with a Colt automatic (not that
143,THE CAPTIVE,"_she’s_ any sort of weapon, but I take her for an illustration), he’d"
144,THE CAPTIVE,be strung up quicker’n a snowflake ’ud melt in hell. No ambassador of
145,THE CAPTIVE,"yours ’ud save him. I’m my neck ahead on this game, anyway. That’s how"
146,THE CAPTIVE,I regard the proposition.
147,THE CAPTIVE,
148,THE CAPTIVE,"“Have I gone gunning against the British? To a certain extent, I"
149,THE CAPTIVE,presume you never heard tell of the Laughton-Zigler automatic two-inch
150,THE CAPTIVE,"field-gun, with self-feeding hopper, single oil-cylinder recoil, and"
151,THE CAPTIVE,"ballbearing gear throughout? Or Laughtite, the new explosive?"
152,THE CAPTIVE,"Absolutely uniform in effect, and one-ninth the bulk of any present"
153,THE CAPTIVE,"effete charge—flake, cannonite, cordite, troisdorf, cellulose, cocoa,"
154,THE CAPTIVE,"cord, or prism—I don’t care what it is. Laughtite’s immense; so’s the"
155,THE CAPTIVE,Zigler automatic. It’s me. It’s fifteen years of me. You are not a
156,THE CAPTIVE,"gun-sharp? I am sorry. I could have surprised you. Apart from my gun,"
157,THE CAPTIVE,"my tale don’t amount to much of anything. I thank you, but I don’t use"
158,THE CAPTIVE,any tobacco you’d be likely to carry… Bull Durham? _Bull Durham!_ I
159,THE CAPTIVE,take it all back—every last word. Bull Durham—here! If ever you strike
160,THE CAPTIVE,"Akron, Ohio, when this fool-war’s over, remember you’ve Laughton O."
161,THE CAPTIVE,Zigler in your vest pocket. Including the city of Akron. We’ve a little
162,THE CAPTIVE,club there…. Hell! What’s the sense of talking Akron with no pants?
163,THE CAPTIVE,
164,THE CAPTIVE,“My gun? … For two cents I’d have shipped her to our Filipeens. ‘Came
165,THE CAPTIVE,"mighty near it too; but from what I’d read in the papers, you can’t"
166,THE CAPTIVE,trust Aguinaldo’s crowd on scientific matters. Why don’t I offer it to
167,THE CAPTIVE,"our army? Well, you’ve an effete aristocracy running yours, and we’ve a"
168,THE CAPTIVE,crowd of politicians. The results are practically identical. I am not
169,THE CAPTIVE,taking any U.S. Army in mine.
170,THE CAPTIVE,
171,THE CAPTIVE,“I went to Amsterdam with her—to this Dutch junta that supposes it’s
172,THE CAPTIVE,"bossing the war. I wasn’t brought up to love the British for one thing,"
173,THE CAPTIVE,and for another I knew that if she got in her fine work (my gun) I’d
174,THE CAPTIVE,stand more chance of receiving an unbiassed report from a crowd of
175,THE CAPTIVE,dam-fool British officers than from a hatful of politicians’ nephews
176,THE CAPTIVE,"doing duty as commissaries and ordnance sharps. As I said, I put the"
177,THE CAPTIVE,brown man out of the question. That’s the way _I_ regarded the
178,THE CAPTIVE,proposition.
179,THE CAPTIVE,
180,THE CAPTIVE,“The Dutch in Holland don’t amount to a row of pins. Maybe I misjudge
181,THE CAPTIVE,’em. Maybe they’ve been swindled too often by self-seeking adventurers
182,THE CAPTIVE,"to know a enthusiast when they see him. Anyway, they’re slower than the"
183,THE CAPTIVE,Wrath o’ God. But on delusions—as to their winning out next Thursday
184,THE CAPTIVE,week at 9 A.M.—they are—if I may say so—quite British.
185,THE CAPTIVE,
186,THE CAPTIVE,"“I’ll tell you a curious thing, too. I fought ’em for ten days before I"
187,THE CAPTIVE,could get the financial side of my game fixed to my liking. I knew they
188,THE CAPTIVE,"didn’t believe in the Zigler, but they’d no call to be crazy-mean. I"
189,THE CAPTIVE,"fixed it—free passage and freight for me and the gun to Delagoa Bay,"
190,THE CAPTIVE,"and beyond by steam and rail. Then I went aboard to see her crated, and"
191,THE CAPTIVE,"there I struck my fellow-passengers—all deadheads, same as me. Well,"
192,THE CAPTIVE,"Sir, I turned in my tracks where I stood and besieged the"
193,THE CAPTIVE,"ticket-office, and I said, ‘Look at here, Van Dunk. I’m paying for my"
194,THE CAPTIVE,passage and her room in the hold—every square and cubic foot.’ ‘Guess
195,THE CAPTIVE,he knocked down the fare to himself; but I paid. I paid. I wasn’t going
196,THE CAPTIVE,to deadhead along o’ _that_ crowd of Pentecostal sweepings. ’Twould
197,THE CAPTIVE,have hoodooed my gun for all time. That was the way I regarded the
198,THE CAPTIVE,"proposition. No, Sir, they were not pretty company."
199,THE CAPTIVE,
200,THE CAPTIVE,“When we struck Pretoria I had a hell-and-a-half of a time trying to
201,THE CAPTIVE,interest the Dutch vote in my gun an’ her potentialities. The bottom
202,THE CAPTIVE,was out of things rather much just about that time. Kruger was praying
203,THE CAPTIVE,"some and stealing some, and the Hollander lot was singing, ‘If you"
204,THE CAPTIVE,"haven’t any money you needn’t come round,’ Nobody was spending his"
205,THE CAPTIVE,dough on anything except tickets to Europe. We were both grossly
206,THE CAPTIVE,neglected. When I think how I used to give performances in the public
207,THE CAPTIVE,"streets with dummy cartridges, filling the hopper and turning the"
208,THE CAPTIVE,"handle till the sweat dropped off me, I blush, Sir. I’ve made her to do"
209,THE CAPTIVE,"her stunts before Kaffirs—naked sons of Ham—in Commissioner Street,"
210,THE CAPTIVE,trying to get a holt somewhere.
211,THE CAPTIVE,
212,THE CAPTIVE,“Did I talk? I despise exaggeration—’tain’t American or scientific—but
213,THE CAPTIVE,"as true as I’m sitting here like a blue-ended baboon in a kloof, Teddy"
214,THE CAPTIVE,Roosevelt’s Western tour was a maiden’s sigh compared to my advertising
215,THE CAPTIVE,work.
216,THE CAPTIVE,
217,THE CAPTIVE,“’Long in the spring I was rescued by a commandant called Van Zyl—a
218,THE CAPTIVE,"big, fleshy man with a lame leg. Take away his hair and his gun and"
219,THE CAPTIVE,he’d make a first-class Schenectady bar-keep. He found me and the
220,THE CAPTIVE,"Zigler on the veldt (Pretoria wasn’t wholesome at that time), and he"
221,THE CAPTIVE,annexed me in a somnambulistic sort o’ way. He was dead against the war
222,THE CAPTIVE,"from the start, but, being a Dutchman, he fought a sight better than"
223,THE CAPTIVE,the rest of that ‘God and the Mauser’ outfit. Adrian Van Zyl. Slept a
224,THE CAPTIVE,heap in the daytime—and didn’t love niggers. I liked him. I was the
225,THE CAPTIVE,only foreigner in his commando. The rest was Georgia Crackers and
226,THE CAPTIVE,Pennsylvania Dutch—with a dash o’ Philadelphia lawyer. I could tell you
227,THE CAPTIVE,things about them would surprise you. Religion for one thing; women for
228,THE CAPTIVE,another; but I don’t know as their notions o’ geography weren’t the
229,THE CAPTIVE,craziest. ‘Guess that must be some sort of automatic compensation.
230,THE CAPTIVE,There wasn’t one blamed ant-hill in their district they didn’t know
231,THE CAPTIVE,"_and_ use; but the world was flat, they said, and England was a day’s"
232,THE CAPTIVE,trek from Cape Town.
233,THE CAPTIVE,
234,THE CAPTIVE,"“They could fight in their own way, and don’t you forget it. But I"
235,THE CAPTIVE,"guess you will not. They fought to kill, and, by what I could make out,"
236,THE CAPTIVE,the British fought to be killed. So both parties were accommodated.
237,THE CAPTIVE,
238,THE CAPTIVE,"“I am the captive of your bow and spear, Sir. The position has its"
239,THE CAPTIVE,obligations—on both sides. You could not be offensive or partisan to
240,THE CAPTIVE,"me. I cannot, for the same reason, be offensive to you. Therefore I"
241,THE CAPTIVE,will not give you my opinions on the conduct of your war.
242,THE CAPTIVE,
243,THE CAPTIVE,"“Anyway, I didn’t take the field as an offensive partisan, but as an"
244,THE CAPTIVE,"inventor. It was a condition and not a theory that confronted me. (Yes,"
245,THE CAPTIVE,"Sir, I’m a Democrat by conviction, and that was one of the best things"
246,THE CAPTIVE,Grover Cleveland ever got off.)
247,THE CAPTIVE,
248,THE CAPTIVE,"“After three months’ trek, old man Van Zyl had his commando in good"
249,THE CAPTIVE,"shape and refitted off the British, and he reckoned he’d wait on a"
250,THE CAPTIVE,British General of his acquaintance that did business on a circuit
251,THE CAPTIVE,"between Stompiesneuk, Jackhalputs, Vrelegen, and Odendaalstroom, year"
252,THE CAPTIVE,in and year out. He was a fixture in that section.
253,THE CAPTIVE,
254,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘He’s a dam’ good man,’ says Van Zyl. ‘He’s a friend of mine. He sent"
255,THE CAPTIVE,in a fine doctor when I was wounded and our Hollander doc. wanted to
256,THE CAPTIVE,"cut my leg off. Ya, I’ll guess we’ll stay with him.’ Up to date, me and"
257,THE CAPTIVE,my Zigler had lived in innocuous desuetude owing to little odds and
258,THE CAPTIVE,ends riding out of gear. How in thunder was I to know there wasn’t the
259,THE CAPTIVE,ghost of any road in the country? But raw hide’s cheap and lastin’. I
260,THE CAPTIVE,"guess I’ll make my next gun a thousand pounds heavier, though."
261,THE CAPTIVE,
262,THE CAPTIVE,"“Well, Sir, we struck the General on his beat—Vrelegen it was—and our"
263,THE CAPTIVE,crowd opened with the usual compliments at two thousand yards. Van Zyl
264,THE CAPTIVE,"shook himself into his greasy old saddle and says, ‘Now we shall be"
265,THE CAPTIVE,"quite happy, Mr. Zigler. No more trekking. Joost twelve miles a day"
266,THE CAPTIVE,till the apricots are ripe.’
267,THE CAPTIVE,
268,THE CAPTIVE,"“Then we hitched on to his outposts, and vedettes, and"
269,THE CAPTIVE,"cossack-picquets, or whatever they was called, and we wandered around"
270,THE CAPTIVE,the veldt arm in arm like brothers.
271,THE CAPTIVE,
272,THE CAPTIVE,"“The way we worked lodge was this way. The General, he had his"
273,THE CAPTIVE,breakfast at 8:45 A.M. to the tick. He might have been a Long Island
274,THE CAPTIVE,commuter. At 8:42 A.M. I’d go down to the Thirty-fourth Street ferry to
275,THE CAPTIVE,meet him—I mean I’d see the Zigler into position at two thousand (I
276,THE CAPTIVE,"began at three thousand, but that was cold and distant)—and blow him"
277,THE CAPTIVE,off to two full hoppers—eighteen rounds—just as they were bringing in
278,THE CAPTIVE,his coffee. If his crowd was busy celebrating the anniversary of
279,THE CAPTIVE,"Waterloo or the last royal kid’s birthday, they’d open on me with two"
280,THE CAPTIVE,"guns (I’ll tell you about them later on), but if they were disengaged"
281,THE CAPTIVE,"they’d all stand to their horses and pile on the ironmongery, and"
282,THE CAPTIVE,"washers, and typewriters, and five weeks’ grub, and in half an hour"
283,THE CAPTIVE,they’d sail out after me and the rest of Van Zyl’s boys; lying down and
284,THE CAPTIVE,firing till 11:45 A.M. or maybe high noon. Then we’d go from labour to
285,THE CAPTIVE,"refreshment, resooming at 2 P.M. and battling till tea-time. Tuesday"
286,THE CAPTIVE,and Friday was the General’s moving days. He’d trek ahead ten or twelve
287,THE CAPTIVE,"miles, and we’d loaf around his flankers and exercise the ponies a"
288,THE CAPTIVE,piece. Sometimes he’d get hung up in a drift—stalled crossin’ a
289,THE CAPTIVE,crick—and we’d make playful snatches at his wagons. First time that
290,THE CAPTIVE,"happened I turned the Zigler loose with high hopes, Sir; but the old"
291,THE CAPTIVE,"man was well posted on rearguards with a gun to ’em, and I had to haul"
292,THE CAPTIVE,her out with three mules instead of six. I was pretty mad. I wasn’t
293,THE CAPTIVE,"looking for any experts back of the Royal British Artillery. Otherwise,"
294,THE CAPTIVE,"the game was mostly even. He’d lay out three or four of our commando,"
295,THE CAPTIVE,and we’d gather in four or five of his once a week or thereon. One
296,THE CAPTIVE,"time, I remember, long towards dusk we saw ’em burying five of their"
297,THE CAPTIVE,boys. They stood pretty thick around the graves. We wasn’t more than
298,THE CAPTIVE,"fifteen hundred yards off, but old Van Zyl wouldn’t fire. He just took"
299,THE CAPTIVE,off his hat at the proper time. He said if you stretched a man at his
300,THE CAPTIVE,prayers you’d have to hump his bad luck before the Throne as well as
301,THE CAPTIVE,your own. I am inclined to agree with him. So we browsed along week in
302,THE CAPTIVE,"and week out. A war-sharp might have judged it sort of docile, but for"
303,THE CAPTIVE,an inventor needing practice one day and peace the next for checking
304,THE CAPTIVE,"his theories, it suited Laughton O. Zigler."
305,THE CAPTIVE,
306,THE CAPTIVE,“And friendly? Friendly was no word for it. We was brothers in arms.
307,THE CAPTIVE,
308,THE CAPTIVE,"“Why, I knew those two guns of the Royal British Artillery as well as I"
309,THE CAPTIVE,used to know the old Fifth Avenoo stages. _They_ might have been
310,THE CAPTIVE,brothers too.
311,THE CAPTIVE,
312,THE CAPTIVE,"“They’d jolt into action, and wiggle around and skid and spit and cough"
313,THE CAPTIVE,and prize ’emselves back again during our hours of bloody battle till I
314,THE CAPTIVE,"could have wept, Sir, at the spectacle of modern white men chained up"
315,THE CAPTIVE,"to these old hand-power, back-number, flint-and-steel reaping machines."
316,THE CAPTIVE,One of ’em—I called her Baldy—she’d a long white scar all along her
317,THE CAPTIVE,"barrel—I’d made sure of twenty times. I knew her crew by sight, but"
318,THE CAPTIVE,she’d come switching and teturing out of the dust of my shells
319,THE CAPTIVE,"like—like a hen from under a buggy—and she’d dip into a gully, and next"
320,THE CAPTIVE,thing I’d know ’ud be her old nose peeking over the ridge sniffin’ for
321,THE CAPTIVE,"us. Her runnin’ mate had two grey mules in the lead, and a natural wood"
322,THE CAPTIVE,"wheel repainted, and a whole raft of rope-ends trailin’ around. ‘Jever"
323,THE CAPTIVE,"see Tom Reed with his vest off, steerin’ Congress through a heat-wave?"
324,THE CAPTIVE,I’ve been to Washington often—too often—filin’ my patents. I called her
325,THE CAPTIVE,Tom Reed. We three ’ud play pussy-wants-a-corner all round the outposts
326,THE CAPTIVE,on off-days—cross-lots through the sage and along the mezas till we was
327,THE CAPTIVE,"short-circuited by canons. O, it was great for me and Baldy and Tom"
328,THE CAPTIVE,Reed! I don’t know as we didn’t neglect the legitimate interests of our
329,THE CAPTIVE,respective commanders sometimes for this ball-play. I know _I_ did.
330,THE CAPTIVE,
331,THE CAPTIVE,“’Long towards the fall the Royal British Artillery grew shy—hung back
332,THE CAPTIVE,in their breeching sort of—and their shooting was way—way off. I
333,THE CAPTIVE,"observed they wasn’t taking any chances, not though I acted kitten"
334,THE CAPTIVE,almost underneath ’em.
335,THE CAPTIVE,
336,THE CAPTIVE,"“I mentioned it to Van Zyl, because it struck me I had about knocked"
337,THE CAPTIVE,their Royal British moral endways.
338,THE CAPTIVE,
339,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘No,’ says he, rocking as usual on his pony. ‘My Captain Mankeltow he"
340,THE CAPTIVE,is sick. That is all.’
341,THE CAPTIVE,
342,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘So’s your Captain Mankeltow’s guns,’ I said. ‘But I’m going to make"
343,THE CAPTIVE,’em a heap sicker before he gets well.’
344,THE CAPTIVE,
345,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘No,’ says Van Zyl. ‘He has had the enteric a little. Now he is"
346,THE CAPTIVE,"better, and he was let out from hospital at Jackhalputs. Ah, that"
347,THE CAPTIVE,Mankeltow! He always makes me laugh so. I told him—long back—at
348,THE CAPTIVE,"Colesberg, I had a little home for him at Nooitgedacht. But he would"
349,THE CAPTIVE,"not come—no! He has been sick, and I am sorry.’"
350,THE CAPTIVE,
351,THE CAPTIVE,“‘How d’you know that?’ I says.
352,THE CAPTIVE,
353,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Why, only to-day he sends back his love by Johanna Van der Merwe,"
354,THE CAPTIVE,"that goes to their doctor for her sick baby’s eyes. He sends his love,"
355,THE CAPTIVE,"that Mankeltow, and he tells her tell me he has a little garden of"
356,THE CAPTIVE,"roses all ready for me in the Dutch Indies—Umballa. He is very funny,"
357,THE CAPTIVE,my Captain Mankeltow.’
358,THE CAPTIVE,
359,THE CAPTIVE,"“The Dutch and the English ought to fraternise, Sir. They’ve the same"
360,THE CAPTIVE,"notions of humour, to my thinking.’"
361,THE CAPTIVE,
362,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘When he gets well,’ says Van Zyl, ‘you look out, Mr. Americaan. He"
363,THE CAPTIVE,comes back to his guns next Tuesday. Then they shoot better.’
364,THE CAPTIVE,
365,THE CAPTIVE,“I wasn’t so well acquainted with the Royal British Artillery as old
366,THE CAPTIVE,"man Van Zyl. I knew this Captain Mankeltow by sight, of course, and,"
367,THE CAPTIVE,"considering what sort of a man with the hoe he was, I thought he’d done"
368,THE CAPTIVE,right well against my Zigler. But nothing epoch-making.
369,THE CAPTIVE,
370,THE CAPTIVE,"“Next morning at the usual hour I waited on the General, and old Van"
371,THE CAPTIVE,Zyl come along with some of the boys. Van Zyl didn’t hang round the
372,THE CAPTIVE,"Zigler much as a rule, but this was his luck that day."
373,THE CAPTIVE,
374,THE CAPTIVE,"“He was peeking through his glasses at the camp, and I was helping"
375,THE CAPTIVE,"pepper, the General’s sow-belly—just as usual—when he turns to me quick"
376,THE CAPTIVE,"and says, ‘Almighty! How all these Englishmen are liars! You cannot"
377,THE CAPTIVE,"trust one,’ he says. ‘Captain Mankeltow tells our Johanna he comes not"
378,THE CAPTIVE,"back till Tuesday, and to-day is Friday, and there he is! Almighty! The"
379,THE CAPTIVE,English are all Chamberlains!’
380,THE CAPTIVE,
381,THE CAPTIVE,“If the old man hadn’t stopped to make political speeches he’d have had
382,THE CAPTIVE,"his supper in laager that night, I guess. I was busy attending to Tom"
383,THE CAPTIVE,Reed at two thousand when Baldy got in her fine work on me. I saw one
384,THE CAPTIVE,"sheet of white flame wrapped round the hopper, and in the middle of it"
385,THE CAPTIVE,there was one o’ my mules straight on end. Nothing out of the way in a
386,THE CAPTIVE,"mule on end, but this mule hadn’t any head. I remember it struck me as"
387,THE CAPTIVE,"incongruous at the time, and when I’d ciphered it out I was doing the"
388,THE CAPTIVE,Santos-Dumont act without any balloon and my motor out of gear. Then I
389,THE CAPTIVE,got to thinking about Santos-Dumont and how much better my new way was.
390,THE CAPTIVE,"Then I thought about Professor Langley and the Smithsonian, and wishing"
391,THE CAPTIVE,I hadn’t lied so extravagantly in some of my specifications at
392,THE CAPTIVE,"Washington. Then I quit thinking for quite a while, and when I resumed"
393,THE CAPTIVE,"my train of thought I was nude, Sir, in a very stale stretcher, and my"
394,THE CAPTIVE,mouth was full of fine dirt all flavoured with Laughtite.
395,THE CAPTIVE,
396,THE CAPTIVE,“I coughed up that dirt.
397,THE CAPTIVE,
398,THE CAPTIVE,“‘Hullo!’ says a man walking beside me. ‘You’ve spoke almost in time.
399,THE CAPTIVE,Have a drink?’
400,THE CAPTIVE,
401,THE CAPTIVE,"“I don’t use rum as a rule, but I did then, because I needed it."
402,THE CAPTIVE,
403,THE CAPTIVE,“‘What hit us?’ I said.
404,THE CAPTIVE,
405,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Me,’ he said. ‘I got you fair on the hopper as you pulled out of that"
406,THE CAPTIVE,donga; but I’m sorry to say every last round in the hopper’s exploded
407,THE CAPTIVE,"and your gun’s in a shocking state. I’m real sorry,’ he says. ‘I admire"
408,THE CAPTIVE,"your gun, Sir.’"
409,THE CAPTIVE,
410,THE CAPTIVE,“‘Are you Captain Mankeltow?’ I says.
411,THE CAPTIVE,
412,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Yes,’ he says. ‘I presoom you’re Mister Zigler. Your commanding"
413,THE CAPTIVE,officer told me about you.’
414,THE CAPTIVE,
415,THE CAPTIVE,“‘Have you gathered in old man Van Zyl?’ I said.
416,THE CAPTIVE,
417,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Commandant Van Zyl,’ he says very stiff, ‘was most unfortunately"
418,THE CAPTIVE,"wounded, but I am glad to say it’s not serious. We hope he’ll be able"
419,THE CAPTIVE,"to dine with us to-night; and I feel sure,’ he says, ‘the General would"
420,THE CAPTIVE,"be delighted to see you too, though he didn’t expect,’ he says, ‘and no"
421,THE CAPTIVE,"one else either, by Jove!’ he says, and blushed like the British do"
422,THE CAPTIVE,when they’re embarrassed.
423,THE CAPTIVE,
424,THE CAPTIVE,"“I saw him slide an Episcopalian Prayer-book up his sleeve, and when I"
425,THE CAPTIVE,looked over the edge of the stretcher there was half-a-dozen enlisted
426,THE CAPTIVE,men—privates—had just quit digging and was standing to attention by
427,THE CAPTIVE,their spades. I guess he was right on the General not expecting me to
428,THE CAPTIVE,dinner; but it was all of a piece with their sloppy British way of
429,THE CAPTIVE,"doing business. Any God’s quantity of fuss and flubdub to bury a man,"
430,THE CAPTIVE,and not an ounce of forehandedness in the whole outfit to find out
431,THE CAPTIVE,whether he was rightly dead. And I am a Congregationalist anyway!
432,THE CAPTIVE,
433,THE CAPTIVE,"“Well, Sir, that was my introduction to the British Army. I’d write a"
434,THE CAPTIVE,"book about it if anyone would believe me. This Captain Mankeltow, Royal"
435,THE CAPTIVE,"British Artillery, turned the doctor on me (I could write another book"
436,THE CAPTIVE,"about _him_) and fixed me up with a suit of his own clothes, and fed me"
437,THE CAPTIVE,"canned beef and biscuits, and give me a cigar—a Henry Clay and a"
438,THE CAPTIVE,whisky-and-sparklet. He was a white man.
439,THE CAPTIVE,
440,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Ye-es, by Jove,’ he said, dragging out his words like a twist of"
441,THE CAPTIVE,"molasses, ‘we’ve all admired your gun and the way you’ve worked it."
442,THE CAPTIVE,Some of us betted you was a British deserter. I won a sovereign on that
443,THE CAPTIVE,"from a yeoman. And, by the way,’ he says, ‘you’ve disappointed me groom"
444,THE CAPTIVE,pretty bad.’
445,THE CAPTIVE,
446,THE CAPTIVE,“‘Where does your groom come in?’ I said.
447,THE CAPTIVE,
448,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Oh, he was the yeoman. He’s a dam poor groom,’ says my captain, ‘but"
449,THE CAPTIVE,he’s a way-up barrister when he’s at home. He’s been running around the
450,THE CAPTIVE,"camp with his tongue out, waiting for the chance of defending you at"
451,THE CAPTIVE,the court-martial.’
452,THE CAPTIVE,
453,THE CAPTIVE,“‘What court-martial?’ I says.
454,THE CAPTIVE,
455,THE CAPTIVE,“‘On you as a deserter from the Artillery. You’d have had a good run
456,THE CAPTIVE,"for your money. Anyway, you’d never have been hung after the way you"
457,THE CAPTIVE,"worked your gun. Deserter ten times over,’ he says, ‘I’d have stuck out"
458,THE CAPTIVE,for shooting you like a gentleman.’
459,THE CAPTIVE,
460,THE CAPTIVE,"“Well, Sir, right there it struck me at the pit of my stomach—sort of"
461,THE CAPTIVE,"sickish, sweetish feeling—that my position needed regularising pretty"
462,THE CAPTIVE,bad. I ought to have been a naturalised burgher of a year’s standing;
463,THE CAPTIVE,"but Ohio’s my State, and I wouldn’t have gone back on her for a"
464,THE CAPTIVE,desertful of Dutchmen. That and my enthoosiasm as an inventor had led
465,THE CAPTIVE,me to the existing crisis; but I couldn’t expect this Captain Mankeltow
466,THE CAPTIVE,"to regard the proposition that way. There I sat, the rankest breed of"
467,THE CAPTIVE,"unreconstructed American citizen, caught red-handed squirting hell at"
468,THE CAPTIVE,"the British Army for months on end. I tell _you_, Sir, I wished I was"
469,THE CAPTIVE,in Cincinnatah that summer evening. I’d have compromised on Brooklyn.
470,THE CAPTIVE,
471,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘What d’you do about aliens?’ I said, and the dirt I’d coughed up"
472,THE CAPTIVE,seemed all back of my tongue again.
473,THE CAPTIVE,
474,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Oh,’ says he, ‘we don’t do much of anything. They’re about all the"
475,THE CAPTIVE,"society we get. I’m a bit of a pro-Boer myself,’ he says, ‘but between"
476,THE CAPTIVE,you and me the average Boer ain’t over and above intellectual. You’re
477,THE CAPTIVE,"the first American we’ve met up with, but of course you’re a burgher.’"
478,THE CAPTIVE,
479,THE CAPTIVE,“It was what I ought to have been if I’d had the sense of a common
480,THE CAPTIVE,"tick, but the way he drawled it out made me mad."
481,THE CAPTIVE,
482,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Of course I am not,’ I says. ‘Would _you_ be a naturalised Boer?’"
483,THE CAPTIVE,
484,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘I’m fighting against ’em,’ he says, lighting a cigarette, ‘but it’s"
485,THE CAPTIVE,all a matter of opinion.’
486,THE CAPTIVE,
487,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Well,’ I says, ‘you can hold any blame opinion you choose, but I’m a"
488,THE CAPTIVE,"white man, and my present intention is to die in that colour.’"
489,THE CAPTIVE,
490,THE CAPTIVE,"“He laughed one of those big, thick-ended, British laughs that don’t"
491,THE CAPTIVE,"lead anywhere, and whacked up some sort of compliment about America"
492,THE CAPTIVE,that made me mad all through.
493,THE CAPTIVE,
494,THE CAPTIVE,"“I am the captive of your bow and spear, Sir, but I do not understand"
495,THE CAPTIVE,the alleged British joke. It is depressing.
496,THE CAPTIVE,
497,THE CAPTIVE,"“I was introdooced to five or six officers that evening, and every"
498,THE CAPTIVE,blame one of ’em grinned and asked me why I wasn’t in the Filipeens
499,THE CAPTIVE,suppressing our war! And that was British humour! They all had to get
500,THE CAPTIVE,it off their chests before they’d talk sense. But they was sound on the
501,THE CAPTIVE,Zigler. They had all admired her. I made out a fairy-story of me being
502,THE CAPTIVE,"wearied of the war, and having pushed the gun at them these last three"
503,THE CAPTIVE,months in the hope they’d capture it and let me go home. That tickled
504,THE CAPTIVE,"’em to death. They made me say it three times over, and laughed like"
505,THE CAPTIVE,kids each time. But half the British _are_ kids; specially the older
506,THE CAPTIVE,men. My Captain Mankeltow was less of it than the others. He talked
507,THE CAPTIVE,"about the Zigler like a lover, Sir, and I drew him diagrams of the"
508,THE CAPTIVE,hopper-feed and recoil-cylinder in his note-book. He asked the one
509,THE CAPTIVE,"British question I was waiting for, ‘Hadn’t I made my working-parts too"
510,THE CAPTIVE,light?’ The British think weight’s strength.
511,THE CAPTIVE,
512,THE CAPTIVE,"“At last—I’d been shy of opening the subject before—at last I said,"
513,THE CAPTIVE,"‘Gentlemen, you are the unprejudiced tribunal I’ve been hunting after."
514,THE CAPTIVE,"I guess you ain’t interested in any other gun-factory, and politics"
515,THE CAPTIVE,don’t weigh with you. How did it feel your end of the game? What’s my
516,THE CAPTIVE,"gun done, anyway?’"
517,THE CAPTIVE,
518,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘I hate to disappoint you,’ says Captain Mankeltow, ‘because I know"
519,THE CAPTIVE,you feel as an inventor.’ I wasn’t feeling like an inventor just then.
520,THE CAPTIVE,"I felt friendly, but the British haven’t more tact than you can pick up"
521,THE CAPTIVE,with a knife out of a plate of soup.
522,THE CAPTIVE,
523,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘The honest truth,’ he says, ‘is that you’ve wounded about ten of us"
524,THE CAPTIVE,"one way and another, killed two battery horses and four mules, and—oh,"
525,THE CAPTIVE,"yes,’ he said, ‘you’ve bagged five Kaffirs. But, buck up,’ he said,"
526,THE CAPTIVE,"‘we’ve all had mighty close calls’—shaves, he called ’em, I remember."
527,THE CAPTIVE,‘Look at my pants.’
528,THE CAPTIVE,
529,THE CAPTIVE,“They was repaired right across the seat with Minneapolis
530,THE CAPTIVE,flour-bagging. I could see the stencil.
531,THE CAPTIVE,
532,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘I ain’t bluffing,’ he says. ‘Get the hospital returns, Doc.’"
533,THE CAPTIVE,
534,THE CAPTIVE,“The doctor gets ’em and reads ’em out under the proper dates. That
535,THE CAPTIVE,doctor alone was worth the price of admission.
536,THE CAPTIVE,
537,THE CAPTIVE,“I was right pleased right through that I hadn’t killed any of these
538,THE CAPTIVE,cheerful kids; but none the less I couldn’t help thinking that a few
539,THE CAPTIVE,more Kaffirs would have served me just as well for advertising purposes
540,THE CAPTIVE,"as white men. No, sir. Anywhichway you regard the proposition,"
541,THE CAPTIVE,twenty-one casualties after months of close friendship like ours
542,THE CAPTIVE,was—paltry.
543,THE CAPTIVE,
544,THE CAPTIVE,“They gave me taffy about the gun—the British use taffy where we use
545,THE CAPTIVE,"sugar. It’s cheaper, and gets there just the same. They sat around and"
546,THE CAPTIVE,"proved to me that my gun was too good, too uniform—shot as close as a"
547,THE CAPTIVE,Mannlicher rifle.
548,THE CAPTIVE,
549,THE CAPTIVE,"“Says one kid chewing a bit of grass: ‘I counted eight of your shells,"
550,THE CAPTIVE,"Sir, burst in a radius of ten feet. All of ’em would have gone through"
551,THE CAPTIVE,"one waggon-tilt. It was beautiful,’ he says. ‘It was too good.’"
552,THE CAPTIVE,
553,THE CAPTIVE,“I shouldn’t wonder if the boys were right. My Laughtite is too
554,THE CAPTIVE,mathematically uniform in propelling power. Yes; she was too good for
555,THE CAPTIVE,"this refractory fool of a country. The training gear was broke, too,"
556,THE CAPTIVE,and we had to swivel her around by the trail. But I’ll build my next
557,THE CAPTIVE,Zigler fifteen hundred pounds heavier. Might work in a gasoline motor
558,THE CAPTIVE,under the axles. I must think that up.
559,THE CAPTIVE,
560,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Well, gentlemen,’ I said, ‘I’d hate to have been the death of any of"
561,THE CAPTIVE,"you; and if a prisoner can deed away his property, I’d love to present"
562,THE CAPTIVE,the Captain here with what he’s seen fit to leave of my Zigler.’
563,THE CAPTIVE,
564,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Thanks awf’ly,’ says my Captain. ‘I’d like her very much. She’d look"
565,THE CAPTIVE,"fine in the mess at Woolwich. That is, if you don’t mind, Mr. Zigler.’"
566,THE CAPTIVE,
567,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Go right ahead,’ I says. ‘I’ve come out of all the mess I’ve any use"
568,THE CAPTIVE,for; but she’ll do to spread the light among the Royal British
569,THE CAPTIVE,Artillery.’
570,THE CAPTIVE,
571,THE CAPTIVE,"“I tell you, Sir, there’s not much of anything the matter with the"
572,THE CAPTIVE,Royal British Artillery. They’re brainy men languishing under an effete
573,THE CAPTIVE,"system which, when you take good holt of it, is England—just all"
574,THE CAPTIVE,"England. ‘Times I’d feel I was talking with real live citizens, and"
575,THE CAPTIVE,times I’d feel I’d struck the Beef Eaters in the Tower.
576,THE CAPTIVE,
577,THE CAPTIVE,"“How? Well, this way. I was telling my Captain Mankeltow what Van Zyl"
578,THE CAPTIVE,had said about the British being all Chamberlains when the old man saw
579,THE CAPTIVE,him back from hospital four days ahead of time.
580,THE CAPTIVE,
581,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Oh, damn it all!’ he says, as serious as the Supreme Court. ‘It’s too"
582,THE CAPTIVE,"bad,’ he says. ‘Johanna must have misunderstood me, or else I’ve got"
583,THE CAPTIVE,the wrong Dutch word for these blarsted days of the week. I told
584,THE CAPTIVE,"Johanna I’d be out on Friday. The woman’s a fool. Oah, da-am it all!’"
585,THE CAPTIVE,"he says. ‘I wouldn’t have sold old Van Zyl a pup like that,’ he says."
586,THE CAPTIVE,‘I’ll hunt him up and apologise.’
587,THE CAPTIVE,
588,THE CAPTIVE,"“He must have fixed it all right, for when we sailed over to the"
589,THE CAPTIVE,General’s dinner my Captain had Van Zyl about half-full of sherry and
590,THE CAPTIVE,"bitters, as happy as a clam. The boys all called him Adrian, and"
591,THE CAPTIVE,treated him like their prodigal father. He’d been hit on the collarbone
592,THE CAPTIVE,"by a wad of shrapnel, and his arm was tied up."
593,THE CAPTIVE,
594,THE CAPTIVE,“But the General was the peach. I presume you’re acquainted with the
595,THE CAPTIVE,"average run of British generals, but this was my first. I sat on his"
596,THE CAPTIVE,"left hand, and he talked like—like the _Ladies’ Home Journal_. J’ever"
597,THE CAPTIVE,"read that paper? It’s refined, Sir—and innocuous, and full of"
598,THE CAPTIVE,nickel-plated sentiments guaranteed to improve the mind. He was it. He
599,THE CAPTIVE,"began by a Lydia Pinkham heart-to-heart talk about my health, and hoped"
600,THE CAPTIVE,"the boys had done me well, and that I was enjoying my stay in their"
601,THE CAPTIVE,midst. Then he thanked me for the interesting and valuable lessons that
602,THE CAPTIVE,I’d given his crowd—specially in the matter of placing artillery and
603,THE CAPTIVE,rearguard attacks. He’d wipe his long thin moustache between
604,THE CAPTIVE,"drinks—lime-juice and water he used—and blat off into a long ‘a-aah,’"
605,THE CAPTIVE,and ladle out more taffy for me or old man Van Zyl on his right. I told
606,THE CAPTIVE,him how I’d had my first Pisgah-sight of the principles of the Zigler
607,THE CAPTIVE,when I was a fourth-class postmaster on a star-route in Arkansas. I
608,THE CAPTIVE,told him how I’d worked it up by instalments when I was machinist in
609,THE CAPTIVE,"Waterbury, where the dollar-watches come from. He had one on his wrist"
610,THE CAPTIVE,then. I told him how I’d met Zalinski (he’d never heard of Zalinski!)
611,THE CAPTIVE,when I was an extra clerk in the Naval Construction Bureau at
612,THE CAPTIVE,"Washington. I told him how my uncle, who was a truck-farmer in Noo"
613,THE CAPTIVE,"Jersey (he loaned money on mortgage too, for ten acres ain’t enough now"
614,THE CAPTIVE,"in Noo Jersey), how he’d willed me a quarter of a million dollars,"
615,THE CAPTIVE,because I was the only one of our kin that called him down when he used
616,THE CAPTIVE,to come home with a hard-cider jag on him and heave ox-bows at his
617,THE CAPTIVE,"nieces. I told him how I’d turned in every red cent on the Zigler, and"
618,THE CAPTIVE,"I told him the whole circus of my coming out with her, and so on, and"
619,THE CAPTIVE,"so following; and every forty seconds he’d wipe his moustache and blat,"
620,THE CAPTIVE,"‘How interesting. Really, now? How interesting.’"
621,THE CAPTIVE,
622,THE CAPTIVE,"“It was like being in an old English book, Sir. Like _Bracebridge"
623,THE CAPTIVE,Hall_. But an American wrote _that!_ I kept peeking around for the
624,THE CAPTIVE,Boar’s Head and the Rosemary and Magna Charta and the Cricket on the
625,THE CAPTIVE,"Hearth, and the rest of the outfit. Then Van Zyl whirled in. He was no"
626,THE CAPTIVE,"ways jagged, but thawed—thawed, Sir, and among friends. They began"
627,THE CAPTIVE,discussing previous scraps all along the old man’s beat—about sixty of
628,THE CAPTIVE,’em—as well as side-shows with other generals and columns. Van Zyl told
629,THE CAPTIVE,’im of a big beat he’d worked on a column a week or so before I’d
630,THE CAPTIVE,joined him. He demonstrated his strategy with forks on the table.
631,THE CAPTIVE,
632,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘There!’ said the General, when he’d finished. ‘That proves my"
633,THE CAPTIVE,"contention to the hilt. Maybe I’m a bit of a pro-Boer, but I stick to"
634,THE CAPTIVE,"it,’ he says, ‘that under proper officers, with due regard to his race"
635,THE CAPTIVE,"prejudices, the Boer’ud make the finest mounted infantry in the Empire."
636,THE CAPTIVE,"Adrian,’ he says, ‘you’re simply squandered on a cattle-run. You ought"
637,THE CAPTIVE,to be at the Staff College with De Wet.’
638,THE CAPTIVE,
639,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘You catch De Wet and I come to your Staff College—eh,’ says Adrian,"
640,THE CAPTIVE,"laughing. ‘But you are so slow, Generaal. Why are you so slow? For a"
641,THE CAPTIVE,"month,’ he says, ‘you do so well and strong that we say we shall"
642,THE CAPTIVE,hands-up and come back to our farms. Then you send to England and make
643,THE CAPTIVE,"us a present of two—three—six hundred young men, with rifles and wagons"
644,THE CAPTIVE,"and rum and tobacco, and such a great lot of cartridges, that our young"
645,THE CAPTIVE,men put up their tails and start all over again. If you hold an ox by
646,THE CAPTIVE,the horn and hit him by the bottom he runs round and round. He never
647,THE CAPTIVE,"goes anywhere. So, too, this war goes round and round. You know that,"
648,THE CAPTIVE,Generaal!’
649,THE CAPTIVE,
650,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Quite right, Adrian,’ says the General; ‘but you must believe your"
651,THE CAPTIVE,Bible.’
652,THE CAPTIVE,
653,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Hooh!’ says Adrian, and reaches for the whisky. ‘I’ve never known a"
654,THE CAPTIVE,"Dutchman a professing Atheist, but some few have been rather active"
655,THE CAPTIVE,Agnostics since the British sat down in Pretoria. Old man Van Zyl—he
656,THE CAPTIVE,told me—had soured on religion after Bloemfontein surrendered. He was a
657,THE CAPTIVE,Free Stater for one thing.’
658,THE CAPTIVE,
659,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘He that believeth,’ says the General, ‘shall not make haste. That’s"
660,THE CAPTIVE,"in Isaiah. We believe we’re going to win, and so we don’t make haste."
661,THE CAPTIVE,As far as I’m concerned I’d like this war to last another five years.
662,THE CAPTIVE,"We’d have an army then. It’s just this way, Mr. Zigler,’ he says, ‘our"
663,THE CAPTIVE,"people are brimfull of patriotism, but they’ve been born and brought up"
664,THE CAPTIVE,"between houses, and England ain’t big enough to train ’em—not if you"
665,THE CAPTIVE,expect to preserve.’
666,THE CAPTIVE,
667,THE CAPTIVE,“‘Preserve what?’ I says. ‘England?’
668,THE CAPTIVE,
669,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘No. The game,’ he says; ‘and that reminds me, gentlemen, we haven’t"
670,THE CAPTIVE,drunk the King and Fox-hunting.’
671,THE CAPTIVE,
672,THE CAPTIVE,“So they drank the King and Fox-hunting. I drank the King because
673,THE CAPTIVE,there’s something about Edward that tickles me (he’s so blame British);
674,THE CAPTIVE,but I rather stood out on the Fox-hunting. I’ve ridden wolves in the
675,THE CAPTIVE,"cattle-country, and needed a drink pretty bad afterwards, but it never"
676,THE CAPTIVE,struck me as I ought to drink about it—he-red-it-arily.
677,THE CAPTIVE,
678,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘No, as I was saying, Mr. Zigler,’ he goes on, ‘we have to train our"
679,THE CAPTIVE,men in the field to shoot and ride. I allow six months for it; but many
680,THE CAPTIVE,"column-commanders—not that I ought to say a word against ’em, for"
681,THE CAPTIVE,"they’re the best fellows that ever stepped, and most of ’em are my"
682,THE CAPTIVE,dearest friends—seem to think that if they have men and horses and guns
683,THE CAPTIVE,"they can take tea with the Boers. It’s generally the other way about,"
684,THE CAPTIVE,"ain’t it, Mr. Zigler?’"
685,THE CAPTIVE,
686,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘To some extent, Sir,’ I said."
687,THE CAPTIVE,
688,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘I’m _so_ glad you agree with me,’ he says. ‘My command here I regard"
689,THE CAPTIVE,"as a training depot, and you, if I may say so, have been one of my most"
690,THE CAPTIVE,efficient instructors. I mature my men slowly but thoroughly. First I
691,THE CAPTIVE,"put ’em in a town which is liable to be attacked by night, where they"
692,THE CAPTIVE,"can attend riding-school in the day. Then I use ’em with a convoy, and"
693,THE CAPTIVE,"last I put ’em into a column. It takes time,’ he says, ‘but I flatter"
694,THE CAPTIVE,myself that any men who have worked under me are at least grounded in
695,THE CAPTIVE,"the rudiments of their profession. Adrian,’ he says, ‘was there"
696,THE CAPTIVE,anything wrong with the men who upset Van Bester’s applecart last month
697,THE CAPTIVE,when he was trying to cross the line to join Piper with those horses
698,THE CAPTIVE,he’d stole from Gabbitas?’
699,THE CAPTIVE,
700,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘No, Generaal,’ says Van Zyl. ‘Your men got the horses back and eleven"
701,THE CAPTIVE,"dead; and Van Besters, he ran to Delarey in his shirt. They was very"
702,THE CAPTIVE,"good, those men. They shoot hard.’"
703,THE CAPTIVE,
704,THE CAPTIVE,“_‘So_ pleased to hear you say so. I laid ’em down at the beginning of
705,THE CAPTIVE,"this century—a 1900 vintage. _You_ remember ’em, Mankeltow?’ he says."
706,THE CAPTIVE,"‘The Central Middlesex Buncho Busters—clerks and floorwalkers mostly,’"
707,THE CAPTIVE,and he wiped his moustache. ‘It was just the same with the Liverpool
708,THE CAPTIVE,"Buckjumpers, but they were stevedores. Let’s see—they were a"
709,THE CAPTIVE,"last-century draft, weren’t they? They did well after nine months."
710,THE CAPTIVE,"_You_ know ’em, Van Zyl? You didn’t get much change out of ’em at"
711,THE CAPTIVE,Pootfontein?’
712,THE CAPTIVE,
713,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘No,’ says Van Zyl. ‘At Pootfontein I lost my son Andries.’"
714,THE CAPTIVE,
715,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘I beg your pardon, Commandant,’ says the General; and the rest of the"
716,THE CAPTIVE,crowd sort of cooed over Adrian.
717,THE CAPTIVE,
718,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Excoose,’ says Adrian. ‘It was all right. They were good men those,"
719,THE CAPTIVE,"but it is just what I say. Some are so dam good we want to hands-up,"
720,THE CAPTIVE,"and some are so dam bad, we say, “Take the Vierkleur into Cape Town.”"
721,THE CAPTIVE,"It is not upright of you, Generaal. It is not upright of you at all. I"
722,THE CAPTIVE,do not think you ever wish this war to finish.’
723,THE CAPTIVE,
724,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘It’s a first-class dress-parade for Armageddon,’ says the General."
725,THE CAPTIVE,"‘With luck, we ought to run half a million men through the mill. Why,"
726,THE CAPTIVE,"we might even be able to give our Native Army a look in. Oh, not here,"
727,THE CAPTIVE,"of course, Adrian, but down in the Colony—say a camp-of-exercise at"
728,THE CAPTIVE,"Worcester. You mustn’t be prejudiced, Adrian. I’ve commanded a district"
729,THE CAPTIVE,"in India, and I give you my word the native troops are splendid men.’"
730,THE CAPTIVE,
731,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Oh, I should not mind them at Worcester,’ says Adrian. ‘I would sell"
732,THE CAPTIVE,"you forage for them at Worcester—yes, and Paarl and Stellenbosch; but"
733,THE CAPTIVE,"Almighty!’ he says, ‘must I stay with Cronje till you have taught half"
734,THE CAPTIVE,a million of these stupid boys to ride? I shall be an old man.’
735,THE CAPTIVE,
736,THE CAPTIVE,"“Well, Sir, then and there they began arguing whether St. Helena would"
737,THE CAPTIVE,"suit Adrian’s health as well as some other places they knew about, and"
738,THE CAPTIVE,fixing up letters of introduction to Dukes and Lords of their
739,THE CAPTIVE,"acquaintance, so’s Van Zyl should be well looked after. We own a"
740,THE CAPTIVE,fair-sized block of real estate—America does—but it made me sickish to
741,THE CAPTIVE,"hear this crowd fluttering round the Atlas (oh yes, they had an Atlas),"
742,THE CAPTIVE,and choosing stray continents for Adrian to drink his coffee in. The
743,THE CAPTIVE,"old man allowed he didn’t want to roost with Cronje, because one of"
744,THE CAPTIVE,Cronje’s kin had jumped one of his farms after Paardeberg. I forget the
745,THE CAPTIVE,"rights of the case, but it was interesting. They decided on a place"
746,THE CAPTIVE,"called Umballa in India, because there was a first-class doctor there."
747,THE CAPTIVE,
748,THE CAPTIVE,"“So Adrian was fixed to drink the King and Foxhunting, and study up the"
749,THE CAPTIVE,"Native Army in India (I’d like to see ’em myself), till the British"
750,THE CAPTIVE,General had taught the male white citizens of Great Britain how to
751,THE CAPTIVE,"ride. Don’t misunderstand me, Sir. I loved that General. After ten"
752,THE CAPTIVE,"minutes I loved him, and I wanted to laugh at him; but at the same"
753,THE CAPTIVE,"time, sitting there and hearing him talk about the centuries, I tell"
754,THE CAPTIVE,"you, Sir, it scared me. It scared me cold! He admitted everything—he"
755,THE CAPTIVE,acknowledged the corn before you spoke—he was more pleased to hear that
756,THE CAPTIVE,his men had been used to wipe the geldt with than I was when I knocked
757,THE CAPTIVE,out Tom Reed’s two lead-horses—and he sat back and blew smoke through
758,THE CAPTIVE,his nose and matured his men like cigars and—he talked of the
759,THE CAPTIVE,everlastin’ centuries!
760,THE CAPTIVE,
761,THE CAPTIVE,“I went to bed nearer nervous prostration than I’d come in a long time.
762,THE CAPTIVE,Next morning me and Captain Mankeltow fixed up what his shrapnel had
763,THE CAPTIVE,left of my Zigler for transport to the railroad. She went in on her own
764,THE CAPTIVE,"wheels, and I stencilled her ‘Royal Artillery Mess, Woolwich,’ on the"
765,THE CAPTIVE,"muzzle, and he said he’d be grateful if I’d take charge of her to Cape"
766,THE CAPTIVE,"Town, and hand her over to a man in the Ordnance there. ‘How are you"
767,THE CAPTIVE,"fixed financially? You’ll need some money on the way home,’ he says at"
768,THE CAPTIVE,last.
769,THE CAPTIVE,
770,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘For one thing, Cap,’ I said, ‘I’m not a poor man, and for another I’m"
771,THE CAPTIVE,not going home. I am the captive of your bow and spear. I decline to
772,THE CAPTIVE,resign office.’
773,THE CAPTIVE,
774,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Skittles!’ he says (that was a great word of his), ‘you’ll take"
775,THE CAPTIVE,"parole, and go back to America and invent another Zigler, a trifle"
776,THE CAPTIVE,heavier in the working parts—I would. We’ve got more prisoners than we
777,THE CAPTIVE,"know what to do with as it is,’ he says. ‘You’ll only be an additional"
778,THE CAPTIVE,"expense to me as a taxpayer. Think of Schedule D,’ he says, ‘and take"
779,THE CAPTIVE,parole.’
780,THE CAPTIVE,
781,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘I don’t know anything about your tariffs,’ I said, ‘but when I get to"
782,THE CAPTIVE,"Cape Town I write home for money, and I turn in every cent my board’ll"
783,THE CAPTIVE,cost your country to any ten-century-old department that’s been
784,THE CAPTIVE,ordained to take it since William the Conqueror came along.’
785,THE CAPTIVE,
786,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘But, confound you for a thick-headed mule,’ he says, ‘this war ain’t"
787,THE CAPTIVE,any more than just started! Do you mean to tell me you’re going to play
788,THE CAPTIVE,prisoner till it’s over?’
789,THE CAPTIVE,
790,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘That’s about the size of it,’ I says, ‘if an Englishman and an"
791,THE CAPTIVE,American could ever understand each other.’
792,THE CAPTIVE,
793,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘But, in Heaven’s Holy Name, why?’ he says, sitting down of a heap on"
794,THE CAPTIVE,an anthill.
795,THE CAPTIVE,
796,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Well, Cap,’ I says, ‘I don’t pretend to follow your ways of thought,"
797,THE CAPTIVE,and I can’t see why you abuse your position to persecute a poor
798,THE CAPTIVE,prisoner o’ war on _his!_’
799,THE CAPTIVE,
800,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘My dear fellow,’ he began, throwing up his hands and blushing, ‘I’ll"
801,THE CAPTIVE,apologise.’
802,THE CAPTIVE,
803,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘But if you insist,’ I says, ‘there are just one and a half things in"
804,THE CAPTIVE,this world I can’t do. The odd half don’t matter here; but taking
805,THE CAPTIVE,"parole, and going home, and being interviewed by the boys, and giving"
806,THE CAPTIVE,lectures on my single-handed campaign against the hereditary enemies of
807,THE CAPTIVE,"my beloved country happens to be the one. We’ll let it go at that,"
808,THE CAPTIVE,Cap.’
809,THE CAPTIVE,
810,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘But it’ll bore you to death,’ he says. The British are a heap more"
811,THE CAPTIVE,"afraid of what they call being bored than of dying, I’ve noticed."
812,THE CAPTIVE,
813,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘I’ll survive,’ I says, ‘I ain’t British. I can think,’ I says."
814,THE CAPTIVE,
815,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘By God,’ he says, coming up to me, and extending the right hand of"
816,THE CAPTIVE,"fellowship, ‘you ought to be English, Zigler!’"
817,THE CAPTIVE,
818,THE CAPTIVE,“It’s no good getting mad at a compliment like that. The English all do
819,THE CAPTIVE,it. They’re a crazy breed. When they don’t know you they freeze up
820,THE CAPTIVE,"tighter’n the St. Lawrence. When they _do_, they go out like an ice-jam"
821,THE CAPTIVE,in April. Up till we prisoners left—four days—my Captain Mankeltow told
822,THE CAPTIVE,"me pretty much all about himself there was; his mother and sisters, and"
823,THE CAPTIVE,"his bad brother that was a trooper in some Colonial corps, and how his"
824,THE CAPTIVE,"father didn’t get on with him, and—well, everything, as I’ve said."
825,THE CAPTIVE,"They’re undomesticated, the British, compared with us. They talk about"
826,THE CAPTIVE,their own family affairs as if they belonged to someone else. ’Taint as
827,THE CAPTIVE,"if they hadn’t any shame, but it sounds like it. I guess they talk out"
828,THE CAPTIVE,"loud what we think, and we talk out loud what they think."
829,THE CAPTIVE,
830,THE CAPTIVE,“I liked my Captain Mankeltow. I liked him as well as any man I’d ever
831,THE CAPTIVE,"struck. He was white. He gave me his silver drinking-flask, and I gave"
832,THE CAPTIVE,him the formula of my Laughtite. That’s a hundred and fifty thousand
833,THE CAPTIVE,"dollars in his vest-pocket, on the lowest count, if he has the"
834,THE CAPTIVE,"knowledge to use it. No, I didn’t tell him the money-value. He was"
835,THE CAPTIVE,English. He’d send his valet to find out.
836,THE CAPTIVE,
837,THE CAPTIVE,"“Well, me and Adrian and a crowd of dam Dutchmen was sent down the road"
838,THE CAPTIVE,to Cape Town in first-class carriages under escort. (What did I think
839,THE CAPTIVE,"of your enlisted men? They are largely different from ours, Sir: very"
840,THE CAPTIVE,"largely.) As I was saying, we slid down south, with Adrian looking out"
841,THE CAPTIVE,of the car-window and crying. Dutchmen cry mighty easy for a breed that
842,THE CAPTIVE,fights as they do; but I never understood how a Dutchman could curse
843,THE CAPTIVE,"till we crossed into the Orange Free State Colony, and he lifted up his"
844,THE CAPTIVE,hand and cursed Steyn for a solid ten minutes. Then we got into the
845,THE CAPTIVE,"Colony, and the rebs—ministers mostly and schoolmasters—came round the"
846,THE CAPTIVE,"cars with fruit and sympathy and texts. Van Zyl talked to ’em in Dutch,"
847,THE CAPTIVE,"and one man, a big red-bearded minister, at Beaufort West, I remember,"
848,THE CAPTIVE,he jest wilted on the platform.
849,THE CAPTIVE,
850,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Keep your prayers for yourself,’ says Van Zyl, throwing back a bunch"
851,THE CAPTIVE,"of grapes. ‘You’ll need ’em, and you’ll need the fruit too, when the"
852,THE CAPTIVE,"war comes down here. _You_ done it,’ he says. ‘You and your picayune"
853,THE CAPTIVE,Church that’s deader than Cronje’s dead horses! What sort of a God have
854,THE CAPTIVE,"you been unloading on us, you black _aas vogels_? The British came, and"
855,THE CAPTIVE,"we beat ’em,’ he says, ‘and you sat still and prayed. The British beat"
856,THE CAPTIVE,"us, and you sat still,’ he says. ‘You told us to hang on, and we hung"
857,THE CAPTIVE,"on, and our farms was burned, and you sat still—you and your God. See"
858,THE CAPTIVE,"here,’ he says, ‘I shot my Bible full of bullets after Bloemfontein"
859,THE CAPTIVE,"went, and you and God didn’t say anything. Take it and pray over it"
860,THE CAPTIVE,before we Federals help the British to knock hell out of you rebels.’
861,THE CAPTIVE,
862,THE CAPTIVE,“Then I hauled him back into the car. I judged he’d had a fit. But
863,THE CAPTIVE,life’s curious—and sudden—and mixed. I hadn’t any more use for a reb
864,THE CAPTIVE,"than Van Zyl, and I knew something of the lies they’d fed us up with"
865,THE CAPTIVE,from the Colony for a year and more. I told the minister to pull his
866,THE CAPTIVE,"freight out of that, and went on with my lunch, when another man come"
867,THE CAPTIVE,along and shook hands with Van Zyl. He’d known him at close range in
868,THE CAPTIVE,the Kimberley seige and before. Van Zyl was well seen by his
869,THE CAPTIVE,"neighbours, I judge. As soon as this other man opened his mouth I said,"
870,THE CAPTIVE,"‘You’re Kentucky, ain’t you?’ ‘I am,’ he says; ‘and what may you be?’ I"
871,THE CAPTIVE,"told him right off, for I was pleased to hear good United States in any"
872,THE CAPTIVE,"man’s mouth; but he whipped his hands behind him and said, ‘I’m not"
873,THE CAPTIVE,knowing any man that fights for a Tammany Dutchman. But I presoom
874,THE CAPTIVE,"you’ve been well paid, you dam gun-runnin’ Yank.’"
875,THE CAPTIVE,
876,THE CAPTIVE,"“Well, Sir, I wasn’t looking for that, and it near knocked me over,"
877,THE CAPTIVE,while old man Van Zyl started in to explain.
878,THE CAPTIVE,
879,THE CAPTIVE,"“‘Don’t you waste your breath, Mister Van Zyl,’ the man says. ‘I know"
880,THE CAPTIVE,this breed. The South’s full of ’em.’ Then he whirls round on me and
881,THE CAPTIVE,"says, ‘Look at here, you Yank. A little thing like a King’s neither"
882,THE CAPTIVE,"here nor there, but what _you’ve_ done,’ he says, ‘is to go back on the"
883,THE CAPTIVE,White Man in six places at once—two hemispheres and four
884,THE CAPTIVE,"continents—America, England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South"
885,THE CAPTIVE,"Africa. Don’t open your head,’ he says. ‘You know well if you’d been"
886,THE CAPTIVE,caught at this game in our country you’d have been jiggling in the
887,THE CAPTIVE,bight of a lariat before you could reach for your naturalisation
888,THE CAPTIVE,"papers. Go on and prosper,’ he says, ‘and you’ll fetch up by fighting"
889,THE CAPTIVE,"for niggers, as the North did.’ And he threw me half-a-crown—English"
890,THE CAPTIVE,money.
891,THE CAPTIVE,
892,THE CAPTIVE,"“Sir, I do not regard the proposition in that light, but I guess I must"
893,THE CAPTIVE,have been somewhat shook by the explosion. They told me at Cape Town
894,THE CAPTIVE,one rib was driven in on to my lungs. I am not adducing this as an
895,THE CAPTIVE,"excuse, but the cold God’s truth of the matter is—the money on the"
896,THE CAPTIVE,floor did it…. I give up and cried. Put my head down and cried.
897,THE CAPTIVE,
898,THE CAPTIVE,"“I dream about this still sometimes. He didn’t know the circumstances,"
899,THE CAPTIVE,but I dream about it. And it’s Hell!
900,THE CAPTIVE,
901,THE CAPTIVE,“How do you regard the proposition—as a Brother? If you’d invented your
902,THE CAPTIVE,"own gun, and spent fifty-seven thousand dollars on her—and had paid"
903,THE CAPTIVE,your own expenses from the word ‘go’? An American citizen has a right
904,THE CAPTIVE,"to choose his own side in an unpleasantness, and Van Zyl wasn’t any"
905,THE CAPTIVE,Krugerite … and I’d risked my hide at my own expense. I got that man’s
906,THE CAPTIVE,"address from Van Zyl; he was a mining man at Kimberley, and I wrote him"
907,THE CAPTIVE,the facts. But he never answered. Guess he thought I lied…. Damned
908,THE CAPTIVE,Southern rebel!
909,THE CAPTIVE,
910,THE CAPTIVE,"“Oh, say. Did I tell you my Captain gave me a letter to an English Lord"
911,THE CAPTIVE,"in Cape Town, and he fixed things so’s I could lie up a piece in his"
912,THE CAPTIVE,"house? I was pretty sick, and threw up some blood from where the rib"
913,THE CAPTIVE,"had gouged into the lung—here. This Lord was a crank on guns, and he"
914,THE CAPTIVE,took charge of the Zigler. He had his knife into the British system as
915,THE CAPTIVE,"much as any American. He said he wanted revolution, and not reform, in"
916,THE CAPTIVE,your army. He said the British soldier had failed in every point except
917,THE CAPTIVE,courage. He said England needed a Monroe Doctrine worse than America—a
918,THE CAPTIVE,"new doctrine, barring out all the Continent, and strictly devoting"
919,THE CAPTIVE,herself to developing her own Colonies. He said he’d abolish half the
920,THE CAPTIVE,"Foreign Office, and take all the old hereditary families clean out of"
921,THE CAPTIVE,"it, because, he said, they was expressly trained to fool around with"
922,THE CAPTIVE,"continental diplomats, and to despise the Colonies. His own family"
923,THE CAPTIVE,"wasn’t more than six hundred years old. He was a very brainy man, and a"
924,THE CAPTIVE,good citizen. We talked politics and inventions together when my lung
925,THE CAPTIVE,let up on me.
926,THE CAPTIVE,
927,THE CAPTIVE,“Did he know my General? Yes. He knew ’em all. Called ’em Teddie and
928,THE CAPTIVE,"Gussie and Willie. They was all of the very best, and all his dearest"
929,THE CAPTIVE,friends; but he told me confidentially they was none of ’em fit to
930,THE CAPTIVE,command a column in the field. He said they were too fond of
931,THE CAPTIVE,advertising. Generals don’t seem very different from actors or doctors
932,THE CAPTIVE,"or—yes, Sir—inventors."
933,THE CAPTIVE,
934,THE CAPTIVE,“He fixed things for me lovelily at Simons-Town. Had the biggest sort
935,THE CAPTIVE,of pull—even for a Lord. At first they treated me as a harmless
936,THE CAPTIVE,lunatic; but after a while I got ’em to let me keep some of their
937,THE CAPTIVE,books. If I was left alone in the world with the British system of
938,THE CAPTIVE,"bookkeeping, I’d reconstruct the whole British Empire—beginning with"
939,THE CAPTIVE,"the Army. Yes, I’m one of their most trusted accountants, and I’m paid"
940,THE CAPTIVE,"for it. As much as a dollar a day. I keep that. I’ve earned it, and I"
941,THE CAPTIVE,deduct it from the cost of my board. When the war’s over I’m going to
942,THE CAPTIVE,"pay up the balance to the British Government. Yes, Sir, that’s how I"
943,THE CAPTIVE,regard the proposition.
944,THE CAPTIVE,
945,THE CAPTIVE,"“Adrian? Oh, he left for Umballa four months back. He told me he was"
946,THE CAPTIVE,going to apply to join the National Scouts if the war didn’t end in a
947,THE CAPTIVE,"year. ’Tisn’t in nature for one Dutchman to shoot another, but if"
948,THE CAPTIVE,Adrian ever meets up with Steyn there’ll be an exception to the rule.
949,THE CAPTIVE,"Ye—es, when the war’s over it’ll take some of the British Army to"
950,THE CAPTIVE,protect Steyn from his fellow-patriots. But the war won’t be over yet
951,THE CAPTIVE,"awhile. He that believeth don’t hurry, as Isaiah says. The ministers"
952,THE CAPTIVE,and the school-teachers and the rebs’ll have a war all to themselves
953,THE CAPTIVE,long after the north is quiet.
954,THE CAPTIVE,
955,THE CAPTIVE,“I’m pleased with this country—it’s big. Not so many folk on the ground
956,THE CAPTIVE,as in America. There’s a boom coming sure. I’ve talked it over with
957,THE CAPTIVE,"Adrian, and I guess I shall buy a farm somewhere near Bloemfontein and"
958,THE CAPTIVE,start in cattle-raising. It’s big and peaceful—a ten-thousand-acre
959,THE CAPTIVE,"farm. I could go on inventing there, too. I’ll sell my Zigler, I guess."
960,THE CAPTIVE,I’ll offer the patent rights to the British Government; and if they do
961,THE CAPTIVE,"the ‘reelly-now-how-interesting’ act over her, I’ll turn her over to"
962,THE CAPTIVE,Captain Mankeltow and his friend the Lord. They’ll pretty quick find
963,THE CAPTIVE,"some Gussie, or Teddie, or Algie who can get her accepted in the proper"
964,THE CAPTIVE,quarters. I’m beginning to know my English.
965,THE CAPTIVE,
966,THE CAPTIVE,"“And now I’ll go in swimming, and read the papers after lunch. I"
967,THE CAPTIVE,haven’t had such a good time since Willie died.” He pulled the blue
968,THE CAPTIVE,"shirt over his head as the bathers returned to their piles of clothing,"
969,THE CAPTIVE,"and, speaking through the folds, added:"
970,THE CAPTIVE,
971,THE CAPTIVE,"“But if you want to realise your assets, you should lease the whole"
972,THE CAPTIVE,proposition to America for ninety-nine years.”

1037,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"other publication, it is not bound in lead boards—a work by one “M. de"
1038,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"C.,” based on the absolutely unadorned performances of one of our"
1039,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,well-known _Acolyte_ type of cruisers. It contains nothing that did not
1040,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,happen. It covers a period of two days; runs to twenty-seven pages of
1041,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,large type exclusive of appendices; and carries as many exclamation
1042,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,points as the average Dumas novel.
1043,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1044,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"I read it with care, from the adorably finished prologue—it is the"

1047,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the impassioned end; and my first notion was that I had been cheated.
1048,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,In this sort of book-collecting you will see how entirely the

1051,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“M. de C.,” I read, opened his campaign by stowing away in one of her"
1052,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"boats what time H.M.S. _Archimandrite_ lay off Funchal. “M. de C.” was,"
1053,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"always on behalf of his country, a Madeira Portuguese fleeing from the"
1054,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,conscription. They discovered him eighty miles at sea and bade him
1055,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"assist the cook. So far this seemed fairly reasonable. Next day, thanks"
1056,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"to his histrionic powers and his ingratiating address, he was promoted"
1057,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"to the rank of “supernumerary captain’s servant”—a “post which,” I give"
1058,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"his words, “I flatter myself, was created for me alone, and furnished"
1059,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,me with opportunities unequalled for a task in which one word

1061,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1062,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"From this point onward, earth and water between them held no marvels"

1066,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"I was not acquainted with any officer, seaman, or marine in the"
1067,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,_Archimandrite_; but instinct told me I could not go far wrong if I
1068,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,took a third-class ticket to Plymouth.
1069,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1070,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"I gathered information on the way from a leading stoker, two"
1071,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"seaman-gunners, and an odd hand in a torpedo factory. They courteously"
1072,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"set my feet on the right path, and that led me through the alleys of"
1073,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Devonport to a public-house not fifty yards from the water. We drank
1074,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"with the proprietor, a huge, yellowish man called Tom Wessels; and when"
1075,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"my guides had departed, I asked if he could produce any warrant or"

1078,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“The _Bedlamite_, d’you mean—’er last commission, when they all went"

1082,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1083,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“You’ll excuse me, o’ course, but—what d’you want ’im _for?_”"
1084,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1085,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“I want to make him drunk. I want to make you drunk—if you like. I want
1086,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,to make him drunk here.”
1087,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1088,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Spoke very ’andsome. I’ll do what I can.” He went out towards the
1089,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,water that lapped at the foot of the street. I gathered from the
1090,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,pot-boy that he was a person of influence beyond Admirals.
1091,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1092,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"In a few minutes I heard the noise of an advancing crowd, and the voice"
1093,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,of Mr. Wessels.
1094,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1095,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“’E only wants to make you drunk at ’is expense. Dessay ’e’ll stand you
1096,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,all a drink. Come up an’ look at ’im. ’E don’t bite.”
1097,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1098,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"A square man, with remarkable eyes, entered at the head of six large"
1099,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,bluejackets. Behind them gathered a contingent of hopeful
1100,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,free-drinkers.
1101,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1102,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“’E’s the only one I could get. Transferred to the _Postulant_ six
1103,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,months back. I found ’im quite accidental.” Mr. Wessels beamed.
1104,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1105,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“I’m in charge o’ the cutter. Our wardroom is dinin’ on the beach _en
1106,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"masse_. They won’t be home till mornin’,” said the square man with the"
1107,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,remarkable eyes. “Are you an _Archimandrite?_” I demanded.
1108,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1109,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“That’s me. I was, as you might say.”"
1110,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1111,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Hold on. I’m a _Archimandrite._” A Red Marine with moist eyes tried to
1112,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,climb on the table. “Was you lookin’ for a _Bedlamite?_ I’ve—I’ve been
1113,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"invalided, an’ what with that, an’ visitin’ my family ’ome at Lewes,"
1114,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,per’aps I’ve come late. ’Ave I?”
1115,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1116,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“You’ve ’ad all that’s good for you,” said Tom Wessels, as the Red"

1118,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1119,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“There are those ’oo haven’t ’ad a thing yet!” cried a voice by the

1121,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1122,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“I will take this _Archimandrite_,” I said, “and this Marine. Will you"
1123,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"please give the boat’s crew a drink now, and another in half an hour"
1124,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,if—if Mr.——”
1125,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1126,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Pyecroft,” said the square man. “Emanuel Pyecroft, second-class"

1128,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1129,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“—Mr. Pyecroft doesn’t object?”
1130,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1131,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“He don’t. Clear out. Goldin’, you picket the hill by yourself,"
1132,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,throwin’ out a skirmishin’-line in ample time to let me know when
1133,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Number One’s comin’ down from his vittles.”
1134,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1135,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"The crowd dissolved. We passed into the quiet of the inner bar, the Red"
1136,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Marine zealously leading the way.
1137,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1138,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“And what do you drink, Mr. Pyecroft?” I said."
1139,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1140,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Only water. Warm water, with a little whisky an’ sugar an’ per’aps a"

1142,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1143,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Mine’s beer,” said the Marine. “It always was.”"
1144,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1145,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Look ’ere, Glass. You take an’ go to sleep. The picket’ll be comin’"
1146,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"for you in a little time, an’ per’aps you’ll ’ave slep’ it off by then."
1147,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"What’s your ship, now?” said Mr. Wessels."
1148,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1149,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“The Ship o’ State—most important?” said the Red Marine magnificently,"
1150,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,and shut his eyes.
1151,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1152,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“That’s right,” said Mr. Pyecroft. “He’s safest where he is. An’"
1153,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,now—here’s santy to us all!—what d’you want o’ me?”
1154,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1155,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“I want to read you something.”
1156,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1157,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Tracts, again!” said the Marine, never opening his eyes. “Well. I’m"
1158,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"game…. A little more ’ead to it, miss, please.”"
1159,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1160,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“He thinks ’e’s drinkin’—lucky beggar!” said Mr. Pyecroft. “I’m
1161,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,agreeable to be read to. ’Twon’t alter my convictions. I may as well
1162,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,tell you beforehand I’m a Plymouth Brother.”
1163,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1164,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"He composed his face with the air of one in the dentist’s chair, and I"
1165,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,began at the third page of “M. de C.”
1166,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1167,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘_At the moment of asphyxiation, for I had hidden myself under the"
1168,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"boat’s cover, I heard footsteps upon the superstructure and coughed"
1169,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"with empress_’—coughed loudly, Mr. Pyecroft. ‘_By this time I judged"
1170,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the vessel to be sufficiently far from land. A number of sailors
1171,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,extricated me amid language appropriate to their national brutality. I
1172,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"responded that I named myself Antonio, and that I sought to save myself"
1173,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,from the Portuguese conscription_.’
1174,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1175,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Ho!” said Mr. Pyecroft, and the fashion of his countenance changed."
1176,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Then pensively: “Ther beggar! What might you have in your hand there?”
1177,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1178,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“It’s the story of Antonio—a stowaway in the _Archimandrite’s_ cutter.
1179,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"A French spy when he’s at home, I fancy. What do _you_ know about it?”"
1180,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1181,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“An’ I thought it was tracts! An’ yet some’ow I didn’t.” Mr. Pyecroft
1182,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,nodded his head wonderingly. “Our old man was quite right—so was ’Op—so
1183,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"was I. ’Ere, Glass!” He kicked the Marine. “Here’s our Antonio ’as"
1184,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,written a impromptu book! He _was_ a spy all right.”
1185,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1186,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"The Red Marine turned slightly, speaking with the awful precision of"
1187,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the half-drunk. “’As ’e got any-thin’ in about my ’orrible death an’
1188,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"execution? Ex_cuse_ me, but if I open my eyes, I shan’t be well. That’s"
1189,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,where I’m different from _all_ other men. Ahem!”
1190,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1191,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“What about Glass’s execution?” demanded Pyecroft.
1192,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1193,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“The book’s in French,” I replied."
1194,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1195,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Then it’s no good to me.”
1196,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1197,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Precisely. Now I want you to tell your story just as it happened. I’ll
1198,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,check it by this book. Take a cigar. I know about his being dragged out
1199,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,of the cutter. What I want to know is what was the meaning of all the
1200,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"other things, because they’re unusual.”"
1201,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1202,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“They were,” said Mr. Pyecroft with emphasis. “Lookin’ back on it as I"
1203,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,set here more an’ more I see what an ’ighly unusual affair it was. But
1204,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,it happened. It transpired in the _Archimandrite_—the ship you can
1205,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,trust… Antonio! Ther beggar!”
1206,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1207,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Take your time, Mr. Pyecroft.”"
1208,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1209,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,In a few moments we came to it thus—
1210,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1211,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“The old man was displeased. I don’t deny he was quite a little
1212,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,displeased. With the mail-boats trottin’ into Madeira every twenty
1213,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"minutes, he didn’t see why a lop-eared Portugee had to take liberties"
1214,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"with a man-o’-war’s first cutter. Any’ow, we couldn’t turn ship round"
1215,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"for him. We drew him out and took him out to Number One. ‘Drown ’im,’"
1216,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,’e says. ‘Drown ’im before ’e dirties my fine new decks.’ But our owner
1217,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"was tenderhearted. ‘Take him to the galley,’ ’e says. ‘Boil ’im! Skin"
1218,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,’im! Cook ’im! Cut ’is bloomin’ hair? Take ’is bloomin’ number! We’ll
1219,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,have him executed at Ascension.’
1220,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1221,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Retallick, our chief cook, an’ a Carth’lic, was the on’y one any way"
1222,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,near grateful; bein’ short-’anded in the galley. He annexes the
1223,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,blighter by the left ear an’ right foot an’ sets him to work peelin’
1224,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"potatoes. So then, this Antonio that was avoidin’ the conscription—”"
1225,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1226,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“_Sub_scription, you pink-eyed matlow!” said the Marine, with the face"
1227,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"of a stone Buddha, and whimpered sadly: “Pye don’t see any fun in it at"
1228,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,all.”
1229,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1230,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“_Con_scription—come to his illegitimate sphere in Her Majesty’s Navy,"
1231,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"an’ it was just then that Old ’Op, our Yeoman of Signals, an’ a"
1232,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"fastidious joker, made remarks to me about ’is hands."
1233,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1234,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Those ’ands,’ says ’Op, ‘properly considered, never done a day’s"
1235,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,honest labour in their life. Tell me those hands belong to a blighted
1236,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Portugee manual labourist and I won’t call you a liar, but I’ll say you"
1237,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,an’ the Admiralty are pretty much unique in your statements.’ ’Op was
1238,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,always a fastidious joker—in his language as much as anything else. He
1239,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,pursued ’is investigations with the eye of an ’awk outside the galley.
1240,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"He knew better than to advance line-head against Retallick, so he"
1241,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"attacked _ong eshlong_, speakin’ his remarks as much as possible into"
1242,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the breech of the starboard four point seven, an’ ’ummin’ to ’imself."
1243,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Our chief cook ’ated ’ummin’. ‘What’s the matter of your bowels?’ he
1244,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"says at last, fistin’ out the mess-pork agitated like. “‘Don’t mind"
1245,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"me,’ says ’Op. ‘I’m only a mildewed buntin’-tosser,’ ’e says: ‘but"
1246,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"speakin’ for my mess, I do hope,’ ’e says, ‘you ain’t goin’ to boil"
1247,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,your Portugee friend’s boots along o’ that pork you’re smellin’ so
1248,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,gay!’
1249,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1250,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Boots! Boots! Boots!’ says Retallick, an’ he run round like a earwig"
1251,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"in a alder-stalk. ‘Boots in the galley,’ ’e says. ‘Cook’s mate, cast"
1252,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,out an’ abolish this cutter-cuddlin’ abori_gine’s_ boots!’”
1253,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1254,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“They was hove overboard in quick time, an’ that was what ’Op was lyin’"
1255,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,to for. As subsequently transpired.
1256,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1257,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Fine Arab arch to that cutter-cuddler’s hinstep,’ he says to me. ‘Run"
1258,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"your eye over it, Pye,’ ’e says. ‘Nails all present an’ correct,’ ’e"
1259,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"says. ‘Bunion on the little toe, too,’ ’e says; ‘which comes from"
1260,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,wearin’ a tight boot. What do _you_ think?’
1261,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1262,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Dook in trouble, per’aps,’ I says. ‘He ain’t got the hang of"
1263,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,spud-skinnin’.’ No more he ’ad. ’E was simply cannibalisin’ ’em.
1264,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1265,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘I want to know what ’e ’as got the ’ang of,’ says ’Op,"
1266,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"obstructed-like. ‘Watch ’im,’ ’e says. ‘These shoulders were"
1267,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,foreign-drilled somewhere.’
1268,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1269,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,‘“When it comes to “Down ’ammicks!” which is our naval way o’ goin’ to

1280,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"‘Not bad for a Portugee conscript,’ I says to myself, casts off the"

1282,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1283,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“About three minutes later I’m over’auled by our sub-lootenant,"
1284,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"navigatin’ under forced draught, with his bearin’s ’eated. ’E had the"
1285,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,temerity to say I’d instructed our Antonio to sling his carcass in the
1286,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"alleyway, an’ ’e was peevish about it. O’ course, I prevaricated like"
1287,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"’ell. You get to do that in the service. Nevertheless, to oblige Mr."
1288,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Ducane, I went an’ readjusted Antonio. You may not ’ave ascertained"
1289,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,that there are two ways o’ comin’ out of an ’ammick when it’s cut down.
1290,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Antonio came out t’other way—slidin’ ’andsome to his feet. That showed
1291,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"me two things. First, ’e had been in an ’ammick before, an’ next, he"
1292,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,hadn’t been asleep. Then I reproached ’im for goin’ to bed where ’e’d
1293,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"been told to go, instead o’ standin’ by till some one gave him entirely"
1294,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,contradictory orders. Which is the essence o’ naval discipline.

1296,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“In the middle o’ this argument the gunner protrudes his ram-bow from
1297,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"’is cabin, an’ brings it all to an ’urried conclusion with some remarks"
1298,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,suitable to ’is piebald warrant-rank. Navigatin’ thence under easy
1299,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"steam, an’ leavin’ Antonio to re-sling his little foreign self, my"
1300,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,large flat foot comes in detonatin’ contact with a small objec’ on the

1302,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"along under the ball of the big toe to the foot o’ the hatchway, when,"
1303,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"lightly stoopin’, I catch it in my right hand and continue my"

1309,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1310,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“’Op fists it open and peruses. ’E’d known an ’arf-caste Frenchwoman

1333,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1334,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Mr. Pyecroft leaned forward and dealt the Marine a large pattern Navy

1337,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,You’re sober. You don’t know how sober you are!”
1338,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1339,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,The Marine cautiously raised his head a few inches. As Mr. Pyecroft
1340,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"said, he was sober—after some R.M.L.I. fashion of his own devising."
1341,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“’Op bounds in like a startled anteloper, carryin’ ’is signal-slate at"

1345,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1346,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“No! No! No!” cried Pyecroft, kicking again. “What about ’Op?” I"
1347,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"thought the Marine’s ribs would have snapped, but he merely hiccuped."

1352,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"somethin’ ’bout irons. ‘I’ll put ’em on, Sir, in your very presence,’"
1353,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"says ’Op, ‘only ’ear my prayer,’ or—words to that ’fect…. It was jus’"
1354,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the same with me when I called our Sergeant a bladder-bellied,"

1357,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,

1364,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,

1366,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1367,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Lord! How a little moisture disintegrates, don’t it? When we had"
1368,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"ship’s theatricals off Vigo, Glass ’ere played Dick Deadeye to the"

1371,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"It’s only his repartees, which ’e can’t contain, that conquers him."
1372,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Shall I resume my narrative?”
1373,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1374,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Another drink was brought on this hint, and Mr. Pyecroft resumed."
1375,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1376,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“The essence o’ strategy bein’ forethought, the essence o’ tattics is"
1377,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,surprise. Per’aps you didn’t know that? My forethought ’avin’ secured
1378,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the initial advantage in attack, it remained for the old man to ladle"
1379,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,out the surprise-packets. ’Eavens! What surprises! That night he dines
1380,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"with the wardroom, bein’ of the kind—I’ve told you as we were a ’appy"
1381,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"ship?—that likes it, and the wardroom liked it too. This ain’t common"
1382,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,in the service. They had up the new Madeira—awful undisciplined stuff
1383,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,which gives you a cordite mouth next morning. They told the mess-men to
1384,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"navigate towards the extreme an’ remote ’orizon, an’ they abrogated the"
1385,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"sentry about fifteen paces out of earshot. Then they had in the Gunner,"
1386,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the Bo’sun, an’ the Carpenter, an’ stood them large round drinks. It"
1387,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"all come out later—wardroom joints bein’ lower-deck hash, as the sayin’"
1388,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,is—that our Number One stuck to it that ’e couldn’t trust the ship for
1389,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the job. The old man swore ’e could, ’avin’ commanded ’er over two"
1390,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"years. He was right. There wasn’t a ship, I don’t care in what fleet,"
1391,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,could come near the _Archimandrites_ when we give our mind to a thing.
1392,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"We held the cruiser big-gun records, the sailing-cutter (fancy-rig)"
1393,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"championship, an’ the challenge-cup row round the fleet. We ’ad the"
1394,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"best nigger-minstrels, the best football an’ cricket teams, an’ the"
1395,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,best squee-jee band of anything that ever pushed in front of a brace o’
1396,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,screws. An’ _yet_ our Number One mistrusted us! ’E said we’d be a
1397,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"floatin’ hell in a week, an’ it ’ud take the rest o’ the commission to"
1398,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,stop our way. They was arguin’ it in the wardroom when the bridge
1399,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"reports a light three points off the port bow. We overtakes her,"
1400,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"switches on our search-light, an’ she discloses herself as a collier o’"
1401,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"no mean reputation, makin’ about seven knots on ’er lawful occasions—to"
1402,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the Cape most like.
1403,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1404,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Then the owner—so we ’eard in good time—broke the boom, springin’ all"
1405,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,mines together at close interval.
1406,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1407,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Look ’ere, my jokers,’ ’e says (I’m givin’ the grist of ’is"
1408,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"arguments, remember), ‘Number One says we can’t enlighten this"
1409,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,cutter-cuddlin’ Gaulish lootenant on the manners an’ customs o’ the
1410,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Navy without makin’ the ship a market-garden. There’s a lot in that,’"
1411,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"’e says, ‘specially if we kept it up lavish, till we reached Ascension."
1412,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"But,’ ’e says, ‘the appearance o’ this strange sail has put a totally"
1413,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,new aspect on the game. We can run to just one day’s amusement for our
1414,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"friend, or else what’s the good o’ discipline? An’ then we can turn ’im"
1415,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,over to our presumably short-’anded fellow-subject in the small-coal
1416,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"line out yonder. He’ll be pleased,’ says the old man, ‘an’ so will"
1417,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Antonio. M’rover,’ he says to Number One, ‘I’ll lay you a dozen o’"
1418,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,liquorice an’ ink’—it must ha’ been that new tawny port—‘that I’ve got
1419,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"a ship I can trust—for one day,’ ’e says. ‘Wherefore,’ he says, ‘will"
1420,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,you have the extreme goodness to reduce speed as requisite for keepin’
1421,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,a proper distance behind this providential tramp till further orders?’
1422,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Now, that’s what I call tattics."
1423,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1424,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“The other manœuvres developed next day, strictly in accordance with"
1425,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the plans as laid down in the wardroom, where they sat long an’ steady."
1426,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,’Op whispers to me that Antonio was a Number One spy when ’e was in
1427,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"commission, and a French lootenant when ’e was paid off, so I navigated"
1428,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"at three ’undred and ninety six revolutions to the galley, never ’avin’"
1429,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,kicked a lootenant up to date. I may as well say that I did not
1430,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"manœuvre against ’im as a Frenchman, because I like Frenchmen, but"
1431,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,stric’ly on ’is rank an’ ratin’ in ’is own navy. I inquired after ’is
1432,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,health from Retallick.
1433,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1434,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Don’t ask me,’ ’e says, sneerin’ be’ind his silver spectacles. ‘’E’s"
1435,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"promoted to be captain’s second supernumerary servant, to be dressed"
1436,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,and addressed as such. If ’e does ’is dooties same as he skinned the
1437,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"spuds, _I_ ain’t for changin’ with the old man.’"
1438,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1439,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“In the balmy dawnin’ it was given out, all among the ’olystones, by"
1440,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"our sub-lootenant, who was a three-way-discharge devil, that all orders"
1441,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,after eight bells was to be executed in inverse ration to the cube o’
1442,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the velocity. ‘The reg’lar routine,’ he says, ‘was arrogated for"
1443,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"reasons o’ state an’ policy, an’ any flat-foot who presumed to exhibit"
1444,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"surprise, annoyance, or amusement, would be slightly but firmly"
1445,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,reproached.’ Then the Gunner mops up a heathenish large detail for some
1446,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"hanky-panky in the magazines, an’ led ’em off along with our Gunnery"
1447,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Jack, which is to say, our Gunnery Lootenant."
1448,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1449,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“That put us on the _viva voce_—particularly when we understood how the

1462,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,

1469,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"like this all the time, ‘must I chuck away my pension, sub-lootenant or"

1473,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“The leathernecks was layin’ aft at the double, an’ a more insanitary"

1475,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"shirts. They had their trousers on, of course—rolled up nearly to the"
1476,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"knee, but what I mean is belts over shirts. Three or four ’ad _our_"
1477,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"caps, an’ them that had drawn helmets wore their chin-straps like"

1479,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"what our bafflin’ tattics was goin’ to be, but even I was mildly"
1480,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,surprised when this gay fantasia of Brazee drummers halted under the

1487,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,slung it from the muzzle of the port poop quick-firer thort-ships to a
1488,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"stanchion. Then the old man flickered up, smokin’ a cigarette, an’"
1489,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,brought ’is stern to an anchor slow an’ oriental.
1490,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1491,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘What a blessin’ it is, Mr. Ducane,’ ’e says to our sub-lootenant, ‘to"

1496,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1497,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“When Antonio came back with the whisky-an’-soda, he was told off to"
1498,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"swing the ’ammick in slow time, an’ that massacritin’ small-arm party"
1499,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,went on with their oratorio. The Sergeant had been kindly excused from
1500,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"participating an’ he was jumpin’ round on the poop-ladder, stretchin’"
1501,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,’is leather neck to see the disgustin’ exhibition an’ cluckin’ like a
1502,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,ash-hoist. A lot of us went on the fore an’ aft bridge an’ watched ’em
1503,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"like ‘Listen to the Band in the Park.’ All these evolutions, I may as"
1504,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"well tell you, are highly unusual in the Navy. After ten minutes o’"
1505,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"muckin’ about, Glass ’ere—pity ’e’s so drunk!—says that ’e’d had enough"
1506,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,exercise for ’is simple needs an’ he wants to go ’ome. Mr. Ducane
1507,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,catches him a sanakatowzer of a smite over the ’ead with the flat of
1508,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"his sword. Down comes Glass’s rifle with language to correspond, and he"
1509,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,fiddles with the bolt. Up jumps Maclean—’oo was a Gosport
1510,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"’ighlander—an’ lands on Glass’s neck, thus bringin’ him to the deck,"
1511,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,fully extended.
1512,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1513,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“The old man makes a great show o’ wakin’ up from sweet slumbers.
1514,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"‘Mistah Ducane,’ he says, ‘what is this painful interregnum?’ or words"

1517,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1518,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Is that all?’ says the old man, while Maclean sits on Glass’s collar"

1521,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Ah! I suppose that is the ‘invincible _morgue_ Britannic in the

1547,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“I may have omitted to inform you that our Number One took a general
1548,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"row round the situation while the small-arm party was at work, an’ o’"
1549,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,course he supplied the outlines; but the details we coloured in by
1550,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,ourselves. These were our tattics to baffle Antonio. It occurs to the
1551,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Carpenter to ’ave the steam-cutter down for repairs. ’E gets ’is
1552,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"cheero-party together, an’ down she comes. You’ve never seen a"
1553,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"steam-cutter let down on the deck, ’ave you? It’s not usual, an’ she"
1554,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,takes a lot o’ humourin’. Thus we ’ave the starboard side completely
1555,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,blocked an’ the general traffic tricklin’ over’ead along the
1556,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,fore-an’-aft bridge. Then Chips gets into her an’ begins balin’ out a
1557,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,mess o’ small reckonin’s on the deck. Simultaneous there come up three
1558,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"o’ those dirty engine-room objects which we call ‘tiffies,’ an’ a"
1559,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,stoker or two with orders to repair her steamin’-gadgets. _They_ get
1560,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,into her an’ bale out another young Christmas-treeful of small
1561,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,reckonin’s—brass mostly. Simultaneous it hits the Pusser that ’e’d
1562,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,better serve out mess pork for the poor matlow. These things half
1563,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"shifted Retallick, our chief cook, off ’is bed-plate. Yes, you might"
1564,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,say they broke ’im wide open. ’E wasn’t at all used to ’em.
1565,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1566,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Number One tells off five or six prime, able-bodied seamen-gunners to"
1567,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the pork barrels. You never see pork fisted out of its receptacle, ’ave"
1568,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"you? Simultaneous, it hits the Gunner that now’s the day an’ now’s the"
1569,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,hour for a non-continuous class in Maxim instruction. So they all give
1570,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"way together, and the general effect was _non plus ultra_. There was"
1571,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the cutter’s innards spread out like a Fratton pawnbroker’s shop; there
1572,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"was the ‘tiffies’ hammerin’ in the stern of ’er, an’ _they_ ain’t"
1573,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,antiseptic; there was the Maxim class in light skirmishin’ order among
1574,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the pork, an’ forrard the blacksmith had ’is forge in full blast,"
1575,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"makin’ ’orse-shoes, I suppose. Well, that accounts for the starboard"
1576,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,side. The on’y warrant officer ’oo hadn’t a look in so far was the
1577,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Bosun. So ’e stated, all out of ’is own ’ead, that Chips’s reserve o’"
1578,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"wood an’ timber, which Chips ’ad stole at our last refit, needed"
1579,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"restowin’. It was on the port booms—a young an’ healthy forest of it,"
1580,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,for Charley Peace wasn’t to be named ’longside o’ Chips for burglary.
1581,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1582,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘All right,’ says our Number One. ‘You can ’ave the whole port watch"
1583,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"if you like. Hell’s Hell,’ ’e says, ’an when there study to improve.’"
1584,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1585,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Jarvis was our Bosun’s name. He hunted up the ’ole of the port watch
1586,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"by hand, as you might say, callin’ ’em by name loud an’ lovin’, which"
1587,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,is not precisely Navy makee-pigeon. They ‘ad that timber-loft off the
1588,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"booms, an’ they dragged it up and down like so many sweatin’ little"
1589,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,beavers. But Jarvis was jealous o’ Chips an’ went round the starboard
1590,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,side to envy at him.
1591,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1592,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“’Tain’t enough,’ ’e says, when he had climbed back. ‘Chips ’as got his"
1593,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,bazaar lookin’ like a coal-hulk in a cyclone. We must adop’ more
1594,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,drastic measures.’ Off ’e goes to Number One and communicates with ’im.
1595,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Number One got the old man’s leave, on account of our goin’ so slow (we"
1596,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"were keepin’ be’ind the tramp), to fit the ship with a full set of"
1597,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"patent supernumerary sails. Four trysails—yes, you might call ’em"
1598,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,trysails—was our Admiralty allowance in the un’eard of event of a
1599,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"cruiser breakin’ down, but we had our awnin’s as well. They was all"
1600,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"extricated from the various flats an’ ’oles where they was stored, an’"
1601,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,at the end o’ two hours’ hard work Number One ’e made out eleven sails
1602,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,o’ different sorts and sizes. I don’t know what exact nature of sail
1603,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"you’d call ’em—pyjama-stun’sles with a touch of Sarah’s shimmy,"
1604,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"per’aps—but the riggin’ of ’em an’ all the supernumerary details, as"
1605,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"you might say, bein’ carried on through an’ over an’ between the cutter"
1606,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"an’ the forge an’ the pork an’ cleanin’ guns, an’ the Maxim class an’"
1607,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the Bosun’s calaboose _and_ the paintwork, was sublime. There’s no"
1608,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,other word for it. Sub-lime!
1609,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1610,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“The old man keeps swimmin’ up an’ down through it all with the
1611,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"faithful Antonio at ’is side, fetchin’ him numerous splits. ’E had"
1612,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"eight that mornin’, an’ when Antonio was detached to get ’is spy-glass,"
1613,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"or his gloves, or his lily-white ’andkerchief, the old man would waste"
1614,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,’em down a ventilator. Antonio must ha’ learned a lot about our Navy
1615,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,thirst.”
1616,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1617,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“He did.”
1618,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1619,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Ah! Would you kindly mind turnin’ to the precise page indicated an’
1620,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"givin’ me a _résumé_ of ’is tattics?” said Mr. Pyecroft, drinking"
1621,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,deeply. “I’d like to know ’ow it looked from ’is side o’ the deck.”
1622,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1623,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“How will this do?” I said. “‘_Once clear of the land, like Voltaire’s"
1624,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Habakkuk_———”’
1625,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1626,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“One o’ their new commerce-destroyers, I suppose,” Mr. Pyecroft"
1627,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,interjected.
1628,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1629,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“‘—_each man seemed veritably capable of all—to do according to his

1631,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,One cries “Aid me!” flourishing at the same time the weapons of his
1632,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,business. A dozen launch themselves upon him in the orgasm of zeal
1633,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,misdirected. He beats them off with the howlings of dogs. He has lost a
1634,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,hammer. This ferocious outcry signifies that only. Eight men seek the
1635,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"utensil, colliding on the way with some many others which, seated in"
1636,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the stern of the boat, tear up and scatter upon the planking the"
1637,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"ironwork which impedes their brutal efforts. Elsewhere, one detaches"

1675,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Yes, but I like your side of it. For instance. Here’s a little thing I"

1679,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"indeterminate chaos of the grand deck, I ascended—always with a"
1680,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,whisky-and-soda in my hands—to a scene truly grotesque. Behold my
1681,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"captain in plain sea, at issue with his Navigator! A crisis of nerves"
1682,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,due to the enormous quantity of alcohol which he had swallowed up to
1683,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"then, has filled for him the ocean with dangers, imaginary and"
1684,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"fantastic. Incapable of judgment, menaced by the phantasms of his brain"
1685,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"inflamed, he envisages islands perhaps of the Hesperides beneath his"

1690,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Oh, I see! That come after dinner, when our Navigator threw ’is cap"

1721,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1722,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Bonnets in a needlecase! They were stun’sles. That shows the beggar’s

1725,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,extemporisin’ eleven good an’ drawin’ sails out o’ four trys’les an’ a

1728,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Never mind, Mr. Pyecroft. I want to hear about your target-practice,"

1730,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1731,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Oh! We had a special target-practice that afternoon all for Antonio.
1732,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"As I told my crew—me bein’ captain of the port-bow quick-firer, though"
1733,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,I’m a torpedo man now—it just showed how you can work your gun under
1734,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,any discomforts. A shell—twenty six-inch shells—burstin’ inboard
1735,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,couldn’t ’ave begun to make the varicose collection o’ tit-bits which
1736,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"we had spilled on our deck. It was a lather—a rich, creamy lather!"
1737,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1738,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“We took it very easy—that gun-practice. We did it in a complimentary
1739,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"‘Jenny-’ave-another-cup-o’ tea’ style, an’ the crew was strictly"
1740,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,ordered not to rupture ’emselves with unnecessary exertion. This isn’t
1741,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"our custom in the Navy when we’re _in puris naturalibus_, as you might"
1742,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,say. But we wasn’t so then. We was impromptu. An’ Antonio was busy
1743,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"fetchin’ splits for the old man, and the old man was wastin’ ’em down"
1744,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the ventilators. There must ’ave been four inches in the bilges, I"

1747,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Then I thought I might as well bear a hand as look pretty. So I let my

1752,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Government powder, Sir!’ sings out our Gunnery Jack to the bridge,"
1753,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"laughin’ horrid sarcastic; an’ then, of course, we all laughs, which we"

1755,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,what our Gunnery Jack ’ad been after with his subcutaneous details in
1756,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the magazines all the mornin’ watch. He had redooced the charges to a
1757,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"minimum, as you might say. But it made me feel a trifle faint an’"
1758,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,sickish notwithstanding this spit-in-the-eye business. Every time such
1759,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"transpired, our Gunnery Lootenant would say somethin’ sarcastic about"
1760,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Government stores, an’ the old man fair howled. ’Op was on the bridge"
1761,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"with ’im, an’ ’e told me—’cause ’e’s a free-knowledgeist an’ reads"
1762,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,character—that Antonio’s face was sweatin’ with pure joy. ’Op wanted to
1763,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,kick him. Does Antonio say anything about that?”

1765,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Not about the kicking, but he is great on the gun-practice, Mr."
1766,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Pyecroft. He has put all the results into a sort of appendix—a table of
1767,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,shots. He says that the figures will speak more eloquently than words.”
1768,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1769,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“What? Nothin’ about the way the crews flinched an’ hopped? Nothin’
1770,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,about the little shells rumblin’ out o’ the guns so casual?”
1771,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1772,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“There are a few pages of notes, but they only bear out what you say."
1773,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,He says that these things always happen as soon as one of our ships is
1774,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"out of sight of land. Oh, yes! I’ve forgotten. He says, _‘From the"
1775,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,conversation of my captain with his inferiors I gathered that no small
1776,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,proportion of the expense of these nominally efficient cartridges finds
1777,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"itself in his pockets. So much, indeed, was signified by an officer on"
1778,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the deck below, who cried in a high voice: “I hope, Sir, you are making"
1779,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"something out of it. It is rather monotonous.” This insult, so"
1780,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"flagrant, albeit well-merited, was received with a smile of drunken"

1782,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1783,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Resumin’ afresh,” said Mr. Pyecroft, after a well-watered interval, “I"
1784,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"may as well say that the target-practice occupied us two hours, and"
1785,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,then we had to dig out after the tramp. Then we half an’ three-quarters
1786,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"cleaned up the decks an’ mucked about as requisite, haulin’ down the"
1787,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,patent awnin’ stun’sles which Number One ’ad made. The old man was a

1789,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,‘You were right. A week o’ this would turn the ship into a Hayti

1821,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the sea—an’ anythin’ more chronic than the _Archimandrite_ I’d trouble
1822,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"you to behold. She looked like a fancy bazaar and a auction-room—yes,"
1823,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"she almost looked like a passenger-steamer. We’d picked up our tramp,"
1824,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"an’ was about four mile be’ind ’er. I noticed the wardroom as a class,"
1825,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"you might say, was manoeuvrin’ _en masse_, an’ then come the order to"
1826,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,cockbill the yards. We hadn’t any yards except a couple o’ signallin’
1827,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"sticks, but we cock-billed ’em. I hadn’t seen that sight, not since"
1828,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"thirteen years in the West Indies, when a post-captain died o’ yellow"
1829,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"jack. It means a sign o’ mourning the yards bein’ canted opposite ways,"
1830,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,to look drunk an’ disorderly. They do.

1839,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Yes,’ I murmured over my dear book, ‘_the infinitely lugubrious"

1842,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,

1845,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"creep about an’ whisper. Things got stiller and stiller, till they was"
1846,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,as still as—mushrooms! Then the bugler let off the ‘Dead March’ from
1847,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the upper bridge. He done it to cover the remarks of a cock-bird bein’
1848,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"killed forrard, but it came out paralysin’ in its _tout ensemble_. You"
1849,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,never heard the ‘Dead March’ on a bugle? Then the pipes went twitterin’
1850,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"for both watches to attend public execution, an’ we came up like so"
1851,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"many ghosts, the ’ole ship’s company. Why, Mucky ’Arcourt, one o’ our"
1852,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"boys, was that took in he give tongue like a beagle-pup, an’ was"
1853,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"properly kicked down the ladder for so doin’. Well, there we"
1854,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"lay—engines stopped, rollin’ to the swell, all dark, yards cock-billed,"
1855,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,an’ that merry tune yowlin’ from the upper bridge. We fell in on the
1856,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"foc’sle, leavin’ a large open space by the capstan, where our"
1857,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,sail-maker was sittin’ sewin’ broken firebars into the foot of an old
1858,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"’ammick. ’E looked like a corpse, an’ Mucky had another fit o’"
1859,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"hysterics, an’ you could ’ear us breathin’ ’ard. It beat anythin’ in"
1860,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the theatrical line that even us _Archimandrites_ had done—an’ we was
1861,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the ship you could trust. Then come the doctor an’ lit a red lamp which
1862,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"he used for his photographic muckin’s, an’ chocked it on the capstan."
1863,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,That was finally gashly!
1864,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1865,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Then come twelve Marines guardin’ Glass ’ere. You wouldn’t think to
1866,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,see ’im what a gratooitous an’ aboundin’ terror he was that evenin’. ’E

1869,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,as much of his chest as the openin’ of his shirt showed. ’E marched
1870,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"under escort with a firm an’ undeviatin’ step to the capstan, an’ came"
1871,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,to attention. The old man reinforced by an extra strong split—his
1872,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"seventeenth, an’ ’e didn’t throw _that_ down the ventilator—come up on"
1873,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the bridge an’ stood like a image. ’Op, ’oo was with ’im, says that ’e"
1874,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"heard Antonio’s teeth singin’, not chatterin’—singin’ like funnel-stays"
1875,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"in a typhoon. Yes, a moanin’ æolian harp, ’Op said."
1876,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1877,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘When you are ready, Sir, drop your ’andkerchief,’ Number One"

1880,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“‘Good Lord!’ says the old man, with a jump. ‘Eh! What? What a sight!"
1881,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"What a sight!’ an’ he stood drinkin’ it in, I suppose, for quite two"
1882,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,minutes.
1883,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1884,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Glass never says a word. ’E shoved aside an ’andkerchief which the
1885,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,sub-lootenant proffered ’im to bind ’is eyes with—quiet an’ collected;
1886,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"an’ if we ’adn’t been feelin’ so very much as we did feel, his gestures"

1889,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“I can’t open my eyes, or I’ll be sick,” said the Marine with appalling"

1892,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"nearly into the ’orrors. Go on, Pye. Glass is in support—as ever.”"
1893,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1894,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Then the old man drops ’is ’andkerchief, an’ the firin’-party fires"
1895,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"like one man. Glass drops forward, twitchin’ an’ ’eavin’ horrid"

1920,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1921,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Of course, I’m tellin’ it slow, but it all ’appened much quicker. We"
1922,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,run down our trampo—without o’ course informin’ Antonio of ’is ’appy
1923,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,destiny—an’ inquired of ’er if she had any use for a free and gratis
1924,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"stowaway. Oh, yes? she said she’d be highly grateful, but she seemed a"
1925,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"shade puzzled at our generosity, as you might put it, an’ we lay by"
1926,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"till she lowered a boat. Then Antonio—who was un’appy, distinctly"
1927,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"un’appy—was politely requested to navigate elsewhere, which I don’t"
1928,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"think he looked for. ’Op was deputed to convey the information, an’ ’Op"
1929,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,got in one sixteen-inch kick which ’oisted ’im all up the ladder. ’Op
1930,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"ain’t really vindictive, an’ ’e’s fond of the French, especially the"
1931,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"women, but his chances o’ kicking lootenants was like the"

1933,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1934,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“The boat ’adn’t more than shoved off before a change, as you might"
1935,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"say, came o’er the spirit of our dream. The old man says, like"
1936,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Elphinstone an’ Bruce in the Portsmouth election when I was a boy:
1937,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"‘Gentlemen,’ he says, ‘for gentlemen you have shown yourselves to"
1938,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,be—from the bottom of my heart I thank you. The status an’ position of
1939,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"our late lamented shipmate made it obligato,’ ’e says, ‘to take certain"
1940,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"steps not strictly included in the regulations. An’ nobly,’ says ’e,"
1941,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"‘have you assisted me. Now,’ ’e says, ‘you hold the false and felonious"
1942,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"reputation of bein’ the smartest ship in the Service. Pigsties,’ ’e"
1943,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"says, ‘is plane trigonometry alongside our present disgustin’ state."
1944,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"Efface the effects of this indecent orgy,’ he says. ‘Jump, you"
1945,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"lop-eared, flat-footed, butter-backed Amalekites! Dig out, you"
1946,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,briny-eyed beggars!’”
1947,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1948,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Do captains talk like that in the Navy, Mr. Pyecroft?” I asked."
1949,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1950,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“I’ve told you once I only give the grist of his arguments. The Bosun’s
1951,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"mate translates it to the lower deck, as you may put it, and the lower"
1952,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,deck springs smartly to attention. It took us half the night ’fore we
1953,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"got ’er anyway ship-shape; but by sunrise she was beautiful as ever,"
1954,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"and we resoomed. I’ve thought it over a lot since; yes, an’ I’ve"
1955,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,thought a lot of Antonio trimmin’ coal in that tramp’s bunkers. ’E must
1956,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,’ave been highly surprised. Wasn’t he?”
1957,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1958,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“He was, Mr. Pyecroft,” I responded. “But now we’re talking of it,"
1959,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,weren’t you all a little surprised?”
1960,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1961,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“It come as a pleasant relief to the regular routine,” said Mr."
1962,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Pyecroft. “We appreciated it as an easy way o’ workin’ for your
1963,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,country. But—the old man was right—a week o’ similar manœuvres would
1964,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"’ave knocked our moral double-bottoms bung out. Now, couldn’t you"
1965,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,oblige with Antonio’s account of Glass’s execution?”
1966,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1967,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,I obliged for nearly ten minutes. It was at best but a feeble rendering
1968,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"of M. de C.’s magnificent prose, through which the soul of the poet,"
1969,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"the eye of the mariner, and the heart of the patriot bore magnificent"
1970,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,accord. His account of his descent from the side of the “_infamous
1971,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,vessel consecrated to blood_” in the “_vast and gathering dusk of the
1972,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,trembling ocean_” could only be matched by his description of the
1973,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"dishonoured hammock sinking unnoticed through the depths, while, above,"
1974,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,the bugler played music “_of an indefinable brutality_”
1975,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1976,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“By the way, what did the bugler play after Glass’s funeral?” I asked."
1977,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1978,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Him? Oh! ’e played ‘The Strict Q.T.’ It’s a very old song. We ’ad it
1979,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"in Fratton nearly fifteen years back,” said Mr. Pyecroft sleepily."
1980,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1981,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"I stirred the sugar dregs in my glass. Suddenly entered armed men, wet"
1982,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"and discourteous, Tom Wessels smiling nervously in the background."
1983,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1984,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Where is that—minutely particularised person—Glass?” said the sergeant
1985,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,of the picket.
1986,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1987,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“’Ere!” The marine rose to the strictest of attentions. “An’ it’s no
1988,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"good smelling of my breath, because I’m strictly an’ ruinously sober.”"
1989,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1990,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Oh! An’ what may you have been doin’ with yourself?”
1991,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
1992,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,“Listenin’ to tracts. You can look! I’ve had the evenin’ of my little
1993,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,life. Lead on to the _Cornucopia’s_ midmost dunjing cell. There’s a
1994,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,crowd of brass-’atted blighters there which will say I’ve been absent
1995,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,without leaf. Never mind. I forgive them before’and. _The_ evenin’ of
1996,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"my life, an’ please don’t forget it.” Then in a tone of most"
1997,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,ingratiating apology to me: “I soaked it all in be’ind my shut eyes.
1998,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,‘I’m”—he jerked a contemptuous thumb towards Mr. Pyecroft—“’e’s a
1999,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"flatfoot, a indigo-blue matlow. ’E never saw the fun from first to"
2000,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"last. A mournful beggar—most depressin’.” Private Glass departed,"
2001,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,leaning heavily on the escort’s arm.
2002,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
2003,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Mr. Pyecroft wrinkled his brows in thought—the profound and
2004,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,far-reaching meditation that follows five glasses of hot
2005,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,whisky-and-water.
2006,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
2007,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“Well, I don’t see anything comical—greatly—except here an’ there."
2008,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,Specially about those redooced charges in the guns. Do _you_ see
2009,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,anything funny in it?”
2010,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
2011,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,There was that in his eye which warned me the night was too wet for
2012,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,argument.
2013,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,
2014,THE BONDS OF DISCIPLINE,"“No, Mr. Pyecroft, I don’t,” I replied. “It was a beautiful tale, and I"

2117,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"trooper only after all these years? Ye-es. Look at my uniform, if the"
2118,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sahib doubts. Nay—nay; the Sahib looks too closely. All marks of rank
2119,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"were picked off it long ago, but—but it is true—mine is not a common"
2120,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"cloth such as troopers use for their coats, and—the Sahib has sharp"
2121,A SAHIBS’ WAR,eyes—that black mark is such a mark as a silver chain leaves when long
2122,A SAHIBS’ WAR,worn on the breast. The Sahib says that troopers do not wear silver
2123,A SAHIBS’ WAR,chains? No-o. Troopers do not wear the Arder of Beritish India? No. The
2124,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib should have been in the Police of the Punjab. I am not a trooper,"
2125,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"but I have been a Sahib’s servant for nearly a year—bearer, butler,"
2126,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"sweeper, any and all three. The Sahib says that Sikhs do not take"
2127,A SAHIBS’ WAR,menial service? True; but it was for Kurban Sahib—my Kurban Sahib—dead
2128,A SAHIBS’ WAR,these three months!
2129,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2130,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2131,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Young—of a reddish face—with blue eyes, and he lilted a little on his"
2132,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"feet when he was pleased, and cracked his finger-joints. So did his"
2133,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"father before him, who was Deputy-Commissioner of Jullundur in my"
2134,A SAHIBS’ WAR,father’s time when I rode with the Gurgaon Rissala. _My_ father? Jwala
2135,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Singh. A Sikh of Sikhs—he fought against the English at Sobraon and
2136,A SAHIBS’ WAR,carried the mark to his death. So we were knit as it were by a
2137,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"blood-tie, I and my Kurban Sahib. Yes, I was a trooper first—nay, I had"
2138,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"risen to a Lance-Duffadar, I remember—and my father gave me a dun"
2139,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"stallion of his own breeding on that day; and _he_ was a little baba,"
2140,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"sitting upon a wall by the parade-ground with his ayah—all in white,"
2141,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sahib—laughing at the end of our drill. And his father and mine talked
2142,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"together, and mine beckoned to me, and I dismounted, and the baba put"
2143,A SAHIBS’ WAR,his hand into mine—eighteen—twenty-five—twenty-seven years gone
2144,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"now—Kurban Sahib—my Kurban Sahib! Oh, we were great friends after that!"
2145,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"He cut his teeth on my sword-hilt, as the saying is. He called me Big"
2146,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Umr Singh—Buwwa Umwa Singh, for he could not speak plain. He stood only"
2147,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"this high, Sahib, from the bottom of this truck, but he knew all our"
2148,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"troopers by name—every one…. And he went to England, and he became a"
2149,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"young man, and back he came, lilting a little in his walk, and cracking"
2150,A SAHIBS’ WAR,his finger-joints—back to his own regiment and to me. He had not
2151,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"forgotten either our speech or our customs. He was a Sikh at heart,"
2152,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib. He was rich, open-handed, just, a friend of poor troopers,"
2153,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"keen-eyed, jestful, and careless. _I_ could tell tales about him in his"
2154,A SAHIBS’ WAR,first years. There was very little he hid from _me_. I was his Umr
2155,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Singh, and when we were alone he called me Father, and I called him"
2156,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Son. Yes, that was how we spoke. We spoke freely together on"
2157,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"everything—about war, and women, and money, and advancement, and such"
2158,A SAHIBS’ WAR,all.
2159,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2160,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"We spoke about this war, too, long before it came. There were many"
2161,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"box-wallas, pedlars, with Pathans a few, in this country, notably at"
2162,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the city of Yunasbagh (Johannesburg), and they sent news in every week"
2163,A SAHIBS’ WAR,how the Sahibs lay without weapons under the heel of the Boer-log; and
2164,A SAHIBS’ WAR,how big guns were hauled up and down the streets to keep Sahibs in
2165,A SAHIBS’ WAR,order; and how a Sahib called Eger Sahib (Edgar?) was killed for a jest
2166,A SAHIBS’ WAR,by the Boer-log. The Sahib knows how we of Hind hear all that passes
2167,A SAHIBS’ WAR,over the earth? There was not a gun cocked in Yunasbagh that the echo
2168,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"did not come into Hind in a month. The Sahibs are very clever, but they"
2169,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"forget their own cleverness has created the _dak_ (the post), and that"
2170,A SAHIBS’ WAR,for an anna or two all things become known. We of Hind listened and
2171,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"heard and wondered; and when it was a sure thing, as reported by the"
2172,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"pedlars and the vegetable-sellers, that the Sahibs of Yunasbagh lay in"
2173,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"bondage to the Boer-log, certain among us asked questions and waited"
2174,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"for signs. Others of us mistook the meaning of those signs. _Wherefore,"
2175,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib, came the long war in the Tirah_! This Kurban Sahib knew, and we"
2176,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"talked together. He said, “There is no haste. Presently we shall fight,"
2177,A SAHIBS’ WAR,and we shall fight for all Hind in that country round Yunasbagh. Here
2178,A SAHIBS’ WAR,he spoke truth. Does the Sahib not agree? Quite so. It is for Hind that
2179,A SAHIBS’ WAR,the Sahibs are fighting this war. Ye cannot in one place rule and in
2180,A SAHIBS’ WAR,another bear service. Either ye must everywhere rule or everywhere
2181,A SAHIBS’ WAR,obey. God does not make the nations ringstraked. True—true—true!”
2182,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2183,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"So did matters ripen—a step at a time. It was nothing to me, except I"
2184,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"think—and the Sahib sees this, too?—that it is foolish to make an army"
2185,A SAHIBS’ WAR,and break their hearts in idleness. Why have they not sent for men of
2186,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the Tochi—the men of the Tirah—the men of Buner? Folly, a thousand"
2187,A SAHIBS’ WAR,times. _We_ could have done it all so gently—so gently.
2188,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2189,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Then, upon a day, Kurban Sahib sent for me and said, “Ho, Dada, I am"
2190,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"sick, and the doctor gives me a certificate for many months.” And he"
2191,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"winked, and I said, “I will get leave and nurse thee, Child. Shall I"
2192,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"bring my uniform?” He said, “Yes, and a sword for a sick man to lean"
2193,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"on. We go to Bombay, and thence by sea to the country of the Hubshis”"
2194,A SAHIBS’ WAR,(niggers). Mark his cleverness! He was first of all our men among the
2195,A SAHIBS’ WAR,native regiments to get leave for sickness and to come here. Now they
2196,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"will not let our officers go away, sick or well, except they sign a"
2197,A SAHIBS’ WAR,bond not to take part in this war-game upon the road. But _he_ was
2198,A SAHIBS’ WAR,clever. There was no whisper of war when he took his sick-leave. I came
2199,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"also? Assuredly. I went to my Colonel, and sitting in the chair (I am—I"
2200,A SAHIBS’ WAR,was—of that rank for which a chair is placed when we speak with the
2201,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Colonel) I said, “My child goes sick. Give me leave, for I am old and"
2202,A SAHIBS’ WAR,sick also.”
2203,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2204,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"And the Colonel, making the word double between English and our tongue,"
2205,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"said, “Yes, thou art truly _Sikh_”; and he called me an old"
2206,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"devil—jestingly, as one soldier may jest with another; and he said my"
2207,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Kurban Sahib was a liar as to his health (that was true, too), and at"
2208,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"long last he stood up and shook my hand, and bade me go and bring my"
2209,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sahib safe again. My Sahib back again—aie me!
2210,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2211,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"So I went to Bombay with Kurban Sahib, but there, at sight of the Black"
2212,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Water, Wajib Ali, his bearer checked, and said that his mother was"
2213,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"dead. Then I said to Kurban Sahib, “What is one Mussulman pig more or"
2214,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"less? Give me the keys of the trunks, and I will lay out the white"
2215,A SAHIBS’ WAR,shirts for dinner.” Then I beat Wajib Ali at the back of Watson’s
2216,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Hotel, and that night I prepared Kurban Sahib’s razors. I say, Sahib,"
2217,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"that I, a Sikh of the Khalsa, an unshorn man, prepared the razors. But"
2218,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"I did not put on my uniform while I did it. On the other hand, Kurban"
2219,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib took for me, upon the steamer, a room in all respects like to his"
2220,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"own, and would have given me a servant. We spoke of many things on the"
2221,A SAHIBS’ WAR,way to this country; and Kurban Sahib told me what he perceived would
2222,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"be the conduct of the war. He said, “They have taken men afoot to fight"
2223,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"men ahorse, and they will foolishly show mercy to these Boer-log"
2224,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"because it is believed that they are white.” He said, “There is but one"
2225,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"fault in this war, and that is that the Government have not employed"
2226,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"_us_, but have made it altogether a Sahibs’ war. Very many men will"
2227,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"thus be killed, and no vengeance will be taken.” True talk—true talk!"
2228,A SAHIBS’ WAR,It fell as Kurban Sahib foretold.
2229,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2230,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"And we came to this country, even to Cape Town over yonder, and Kurban"
2231,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib said, “Bear the baggage to the big dak-bungalow, and I will look"
2232,A SAHIBS’ WAR,for employment fit for a sick man.” I put on the uniform of my rank and
2233,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"went to the big dak-bungalow, called Maun Nihâl Seyn,[1] and I caused"
2234,A SAHIBS’ WAR,the heavy baggage to be bestowed in that dark lower place—is it known
2235,A SAHIBS’ WAR,to the Sahib?—which was already full of the swords and baggage of
2236,A SAHIBS’ WAR,officers. It is fuller now—dead men’s kit all! I was careful to secure
2237,A SAHIBS’ WAR,a receipt for all three pieces. I have it in my belt. They must go back
2238,A SAHIBS’ WAR,to the Punjab.
2239,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2240,A SAHIBS’ WAR,[1] Mount Nelson?
2241,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2242,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2243,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Anon came Kurban Sahib, lilting a little in his step, which sign I"
2244,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"knew, and he said, “We are born in a fortunate hour. We go to"
2245,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Eshtellenbosch to oversee the despatch of horses.” Remember, Kurban"
2246,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib was squadron-leader of the Gurgaon Rissala, and _I_ was Umr"
2247,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Singh. So I said, speaking as we do—we did—when none was near, “Thou"
2248,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"art a groom and I am a grass-cutter, but is this any promotion, Child?”"
2249,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"At this he laughed, saying, “It is the way to better things. Have"
2250,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"patience, Father.” (Aye, he called me father when none were by.) “This"
2251,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"war ends not to-morrow nor the next day. I have seen the new Sahibs,”"
2252,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"he said, “and they are fathers of owls—all—all—all!”"
2253,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2254,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"So we went to Eshtellenbosch, where the horses are; Kurban Sahib doing"
2255,A SAHIBS’ WAR,the service of servants in that business. And the whole business was
2256,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"managed without forethought by new Sahibs from God knows where, who had"
2257,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"never seen a tent pitched or a peg driven. They were full of zeal, but"
2258,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"empty of all knowledge. Then came, little by little from Hind, those"
2259,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Pathans—they are just like those vultures up there, Sahib—they always"
2260,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"follow slaughter. And there came to Eshtellenbosch some Sikhs—Muzbees,"
2261,A SAHIBS’ WAR,though—and some Madras monkey-men. They came with horses. Puttiala sent
2262,A SAHIBS’ WAR,horses. Jhind and Nabha sent horses. All the nations of the Khalsa sent
2263,A SAHIBS’ WAR,horses.
2264,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2265,A SAHIBS’ WAR,All the ends of the earth sent horses. God knows what the army did with
2266,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"them, unless they ate them raw. They used horses as a courtesan uses"
2267,A SAHIBS’ WAR,oil: with both hands. These needed many men. Kurban Sahib appointed me
2268,A SAHIBS’ WAR,to the command (what a command for me!) of certain woolly
2269,A SAHIBS’ WAR,ones—_Hubshis_—whose touch and shadow are pollution. They were enormous
2270,A SAHIBS’ WAR,eaters; sleeping on their bellies; laughing without cause; wholly like
2271,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"animals. Some were called Fingoes, and some, I think, Red Kaffirs, but"
2272,A SAHIBS’ WAR,they were all Kaffirs—filth unspeakable. I taught them to water and
2273,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"feed, and sweep and rub down. Yes, I oversaw the work of sweepers—a"
2274,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"_jemadar_ of _mehtars_ (headman of a refuse-gang) was I, and Kurban"
2275,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib little better, for five months. Evil months! The war went as"
2276,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Kurban Sahib had said. Our new men were slain and no vengeance was
2277,A SAHIBS’ WAR,taken. It was a war of fools armed with the weapons of magicians. Guns
2278,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"that slew at half a day’s march, and men who, being new, walked blind"
2279,A SAHIBS’ WAR,into high grass and were driven off like cattle by the Boer-log! As to
2280,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the city of Eshtellenbosch, I am not a Sahib—only a Sikh. I would have"
2281,A SAHIBS’ WAR,quartered one troop only of the Gurgaon Rissala in that city—one little
2282,A SAHIBS’ WAR,troop—and I would have schooled that city till its men learned to kiss
2283,A SAHIBS’ WAR,the shadow of a Government horse upon the ground. There are many
2284,A SAHIBS’ WAR,_mullahs_ (priests) in Eshtellenbosch. They preached the Jehad against
2285,A SAHIBS’ WAR,us. This is true—all the camp knew it. And most of the houses were
2286,A SAHIBS’ WAR,thatched! A war of fools indeed!
2287,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2288,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"At the end of five months my Kurban Sahib, who had grown lean, said,"
2289,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"“The reward has come. We go up towards the front with horses to-morrow,"
2290,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and, once away, I shall be too sick to return. Make ready the baggage.”"
2291,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Thus we got away, with some Kaffirs in charge of new horses for a"
2292,A SAHIBS’ WAR,certain new regiment that had come in a ship. The second day by
2293,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"_terain_, when we were watering at a desolate place without any sort of"
2294,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"a bazaar to it, slipped out from the horse-boxes one Sikander Khan,"
2295,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"that had been a _jemadar_ of _saises_ (head-groom) at Eshtellenbosch,"
2296,A SAHIBS’ WAR,and was by service a trooper in a Border regiment. Kurban Sahib gave
2297,A SAHIBS’ WAR,him big abuse for his desertion; but the Pathan put up his hands as
2298,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"excusing himself, and Kurban Sahib relented and added him to our"
2299,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"service. So there were three of us—Kurban Sahib, I, and Sikander"
2300,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Khan—Sahib, Sikh, and _Sag_ (dog). But the man said truly, “We be far"
2301,A SAHIBS’ WAR,from our homes and both servants of the Raj. Make truce till we see the
2302,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Indus again.” I have eaten from the same dish as Sikander Khan—beef,"
2303,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"too, for aught I know! He said, on the night he stole some swine’s"
2304,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"flesh in a tin from a mess-tent, that in his Book, the Koran, it is"
2305,A SAHIBS’ WAR,written that whoso engages in a holy war is freed from ceremonial
2306,A SAHIBS’ WAR,obligations. Wah! He had no more religion than the sword-point picks up
2307,A SAHIBS’ WAR,of sugar and water at baptism. He stole himself a horse at a place
2308,A SAHIBS’ WAR,where there lay a new and very raw regiment. I also procured myself a
2309,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"grey gelding there. They let their horses stray too much, those new"
2310,A SAHIBS’ WAR,regiments.
2311,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2312,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Some shameless regiments would indeed have made away with _our_ horses
2313,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"on the road! They exhibited indents and requisitions for horses, and"
2314,A SAHIBS’ WAR,once or twice would have uncoupled the trucks; but Kurban Sahib was
2315,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"wise, and I am not altogether a fool. There is not much honesty at the"
2316,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"front. Notably, there was one congregation of hard-bitten"
2317,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"horse-thieves; tall, light Sahibs, who spoke through their noses for"
2318,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the most part, and upon all occasions they said, “Oah Hell!” which, in"
2319,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"our tongue, signifies _Jehannum ko jao_. They bore each man a vine-leaf"
2320,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"upon their uniforms, and they rode like Rajputs. Nay, they rode like"
2321,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sikhs. They rode like the Ustrelyahs! The Ustrelyahs, whom we met"
2322,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"later, also spoke through their noses not little, and they were tall,"
2323,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"dark men, with grey, clear eyes, heavily eyelashed like camel’s"
2324,A SAHIBS’ WAR,eyes—very proper men—a new brand of Sahib to me. They said on all
2325,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"occasions, “No fee-ah,” which in our tongue means _Durro mut_ (“Do not"
2326,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"be afraid”), so we called them the _Durro Muts_. Dark, tall men, most"
2327,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"excellent horsemen, hot and angry, waging war _as_ war, and drinking"
2328,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"tea as a sandhill drinks water. Thieves? A little, Sahib. Sikander Khan"
2329,A SAHIBS’ WAR,swore to me; and he comes of a horse-stealing clan for ten generations;
2330,A SAHIBS’ WAR,he swore a Pathan was a babe beside a _Durro Mut_ in regard to
2331,A SAHIBS’ WAR,horse-lifting. The _Durro Muts_ cannot walk on their feet at all. They
2332,A SAHIBS’ WAR,are like hens on the high road. Therefore they must have horses. Very
2333,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"proper men, with a just lust for the war. Aah—“No fee-ah,” say the"
2334,A SAHIBS’ WAR,_Durro Muts_. _They_ saw the worth of Kurban Sahib. _They_ did not ask
2335,A SAHIBS’ WAR,him to sweep stables. They would by no means let him go. He did
2336,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"substitute for one of their troop-leaders who had a fever, one long day"
2337,A SAHIBS’ WAR,in a country full of little hills—like the mouth of the Khaibar; and
2338,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"when they returned in the evening, the _Durro Muts_ said, “Wallah! This"
2339,A SAHIBS’ WAR,is a man. Steal him!” So they stole my Kurban Sahib as they would have
2340,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"stolen anything else that they needed, and they sent a sick officer"
2341,A SAHIBS’ WAR,back to Eshtellenbosch in his place.
2342,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2343,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Thus Kurban Sahib came to his own again, and I was his bearer, and"
2344,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sikander Khan was his cook. The law was strict that this was a Sahibs’
2345,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"war, but there was no order that a bearer and a cook should not ride"
2346,A SAHIBS’ WAR,with their Sahib—and we had naught to wear but our uniforms. We rode up
2347,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and down this accursed country, where there is no bazaar, no pulse, no"
2348,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"flour, no oil, no spice, no red pepper, no firewood; nothing but raw"
2349,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"corn and a little cattle. There were no great battles as I saw it, but"
2350,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"a plenty of gun-firing. When we were many, the Boer-log came out with"
2351,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"coffee to greet us, and to show us _purwanas_ (permits) from foolish"
2352,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"English Generals who had gone that way before, certifying they were"
2353,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"peaceful and well-disposed. When we were few, they hid behind stones"
2354,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and shot us. Now the order was that they were Sahibs, and this was a"
2355,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahibs’ war. Good! But, as I understand it, when a Sahib goes to war,"
2356,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"he puts on the cloth of war, and only those who wear that cloth may"
2357,A SAHIBS’ WAR,take part in the war. Good! That also I understand. But these people
2358,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"were as they were in Burma, or as the Afridis are. They shot at their"
2359,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"pleasure, and when pressed hid the gun and exhibited _purwanas_, or lay"
2360,A SAHIBS’ WAR,in a house and said they were farmers. Even such farmers as cut up the
2361,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Madras troops at Hlinedatalone in Burma! Even such farmers as slew
2362,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Cavagnari Sahib and the Guides at Kabul! We schooled _those_ men, to be"
2363,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"sure—fifteen, aye, twenty of a morning pushed off the verandah in front"
2364,A SAHIBS’ WAR,of the Bala Hissar. I looked that the Jung-i-lat Sahib (the
2365,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Commander-in-Chief) would have remembered the old days; but—no. All the
2366,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"people shot at us everywhere, and he issued proclamations saying that"
2367,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"he did not fight the people, but a certain army, which army, in truth,"
2368,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"was all the Boer-log, who, between them, did not wear enough of uniform"
2369,A SAHIBS’ WAR,to make a loincloth. A fool’s war from first to last; for it is
2370,A SAHIBS’ WAR,manifest that he who fights should be hung if he fights with a gun in
2371,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"one hand and a _purwana_ in the other, as did all these people. Yet we,"
2372,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"when they had had their bellyful for the time, received them with"
2373,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"honour, and gave them permits, and refreshed them and fed their wives"
2374,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and their babes, and severely punished our soldiers who took their"
2375,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"fowls. So the work was to be done not once with a few dead, but thrice"
2376,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and four times over. I talked much with Kurban Sahib on this, and he"
2377,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"said, “It is a Sahibs’ war. That is the order;” and one night, when"
2378,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sikander Khan would have lain out beyond the pickets with his knife and
2379,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"shown them how it is worked on the Border, he hit Sikander Khan between"
2380,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the eyes and came near to breaking in his head. Then Sikander Khan, a"
2381,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"bandage over his eyes, so that he looked like a sick camel, talked to"
2382,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"him half one march, and he was more bewildered than I, and vowed he"
2383,A SAHIBS’ WAR,would return to Eshtellenbosch. But privately to me Kurban Sahib said
2384,A SAHIBS’ WAR,we should have loosed the Sikhs and the Gurkhas on these people till
2385,A SAHIBS’ WAR,they came in with their foreheads in the dust. For the war was not of
2386,A SAHIBS’ WAR,that sort which they comprehended.
2387,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2388,A SAHIBS’ WAR,They shot us? Assuredly they shot us from houses adorned with a white
2389,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"flag; but when they came to know our custom, their widows sent word by"
2390,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Kaffir runners, and presently there was not quite so much firing. _No"
2391,A SAHIBS’ WAR,fee-ah_! All the Boer-log with whom we dealt had _purwanas_ signed by
2392,A SAHIBS’ WAR,mad Generals attesting that they were well-disposed to the State.
2393,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2394,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"They had also rifles not a few, and cartridges, which they hid in the"
2395,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"roof. The women wept very greatly when we burned such houses, but they"
2396,A SAHIBS’ WAR,did not approach too near after the flames had taken good hold of the
2397,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"thatch, for fear of the bursting cartridges. The women of the Boer-log"
2398,A SAHIBS’ WAR,are very clever. They are more clever than the men. The Boer-log are
2399,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"clever? Never, never, no! It is the Sahibs who are fools. For their own"
2400,A SAHIBS’ WAR,honour’s sake the Sahibs must say that the Boer-log are clever; but it
2401,A SAHIBS’ WAR,is the Sahibs’ wonderful folly that has made the Boer-log. The Sahibs
2402,A SAHIBS’ WAR,should have sent _us_ into the game.
2403,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2404,A SAHIBS’ WAR,But the _Durro Muts_ did well. They dealt faithfully with all that
2405,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"country thereabouts—not in any way as we of Hind should have dealt, but"
2406,A SAHIBS’ WAR,they were not altogether fools. One night when we lay on the top of a
2407,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"ridge in the cold, I saw far away a light in a house that appeared for"
2408,A SAHIBS’ WAR,the sixth part of an hour and was obscured. Anon it appeared again
2409,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"thrice for the twelfth part of an hour. I showed this to Kurban Sahib,"
2410,A SAHIBS’ WAR,for it was a house that had been spared—the people having many permits
2411,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and swearing fidelity at our stirrup-leathers. I said to Kurban Sahib,"
2412,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"“Send half a troop, Child, and finish that house. They signal to their"
2413,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"brethren.” And he laughed where he lay and said, “If I listened to my"
2414,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"bearer Umr Singh, there would not be left ten houses in all this land.”"
2415,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"I said, “What need to leave one? This is as it was in Burma. They are"
2416,A SAHIBS’ WAR,farmers to-day and fighters to-morrow. Let us deal justly with them.”
2417,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"He laughed and curled himself up in his blanket, and I watched the far"
2418,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"light in the house till day. I have been on the border in eight wars,"
2419,A SAHIBS’ WAR,not counting Burma. The first Afghan War; the second Afghan War; two
2420,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Mahsud Waziri wars (that is four); two Black Mountain wars, if I"
2421,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"remember right; the Malakand and Tirah. I do not count Burma, or some"
2422,A SAHIBS’ WAR,small things. _I_ know when house signals to house!
2423,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2424,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"I pushed Sikandar Khan with my foot, and he saw it too. He said, “One"
2425,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"of the Boer-log who brought pumpkins for the mess, which I fried last"
2426,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"night, lives in yonder house.” I said, “How dost thou know?” He said,"
2427,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"“Because he rode out of the camp another way, but I marked how his"
2428,A SAHIBS’ WAR,horse fought with him at the turn of the road; and before the light
2429,A SAHIBS’ WAR,fell I stole out of the camp for evening prayer with Kurban Sahib’s
2430,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"glasses, and from a little hill I saw the pied horse of that"
2431,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"pumpkin-seller hurrying to that house.” I said naught, but took Kurban"
2432,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sahib’s glasses from his greasy hands and cleaned them with a silk
2433,A SAHIBS’ WAR,handkerchief and returned them to their case. Sikander Khan told me
2434,A SAHIBS’ WAR,that he had been the first man in the Zenab valley to use
2435,A SAHIBS’ WAR,glasses—whereby he finished two blood-feuds cleanly in the course of
2436,A SAHIBS’ WAR,three months’ leave. But he was otherwise a liar.
2437,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2438,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"That day Kurban Sahib, with some ten troopers, was sent on to spy the"
2439,A SAHIBS’ WAR,land for our camp. The _Durro Muts_ moved slowly at that time. They
2440,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"were weighted with grain and forage and carts, and they greatly wished"
2441,A SAHIBS’ WAR,to leave these all in some town and go on light to other business which
2442,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"pressed. So Kurban Sahib sought a short cut for them, a little off the"
2443,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"line of march. We were twelve miles before the main body, and we came"
2444,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"to a house under a high bushed hill, with a nullah, which they call a"
2445,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"donga, behind it, and an old sangar of piled stones, which they call a"
2446,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"kraal, before it. Two thorn bushes grew on either side of the door,"
2447,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"like babul bushes, covered with a golden coloured bloom, and the roof"
2448,A SAHIBS’ WAR,was all of thatch. Before the house was a valley of stones that rose to
2449,A SAHIBS’ WAR,another bush-covered hill. There was an old man in the verandah—an old
2450,A SAHIBS’ WAR,man with a white beard and a wart upon the left side of his neck; and a
2451,A SAHIBS’ WAR,fat woman with the eyes of a swine and the jowl of a swine; and a tall
2452,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"young man deprived of understanding. His head was hairless, no larger"
2453,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"than an orange, and the pits of his nostrils were eaten away by a"
2454,A SAHIBS’ WAR,disease. He laughed and slavered and he sported sportively before
2455,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Kurban Sahib. The man brought coffee and the woman showed us _purwanas_
2456,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"from three General Sahibs, certifying that they were people of peace"
2457,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and goodwill. Here are the _purwanas_, Sahib. Does the Sahib know the"
2458,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Generals who signed them?
2459,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2460,A SAHIBS’ WAR,They swore the land was empty of Boer-log. They held up their hands and
2461,A SAHIBS’ WAR,swore it. That was about the time of the evening meal. I stood near the
2462,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"verandah with Sikander Khan, who was nosing like a jackal on a lost"
2463,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"scent. At last he took my arm and said, “See yonder! There is the sun"
2464,A SAHIBS’ WAR,on the window of the house that signalled last night. This house can
2465,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"see that house from here,” and he looked at the hill behind him all"
2466,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"hairy with bushes, and sucked in his breath. Then the idiot with the"
2467,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"shrivelled head danced by me and threw back that head, and regarded the"
2468,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"roof and laughed like a hyena, and the fat woman talked loudly, as it"
2469,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"were, to cover some noise. After this passed I to the back of the house"
2470,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"on pretence to get water for tea, and I saw fresh fresh horse-dung on"
2471,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the ground, and that the ground was cut with the new marks of hoofs;"
2472,A SAHIBS’ WAR,and there had dropped in the dirt one cartridge. Then Kurban Sahib
2473,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"called to me in our tongue, saying, “Is this a good place to make tea?”"
2474,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and I replied, knowing what he meant, “There are over many cooks in the"
2475,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"cook-house. Mount and go, Child.” Then I returned, and he said, smiling"
2476,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"to the woman, “Prepare food, and when we have loosened our girths we"
2477,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"will come in and eat;” but to his men he said in a whisper, “Ride"
2478,A SAHIBS’ WAR,away!” No. He did not cover the old man or the fat woman with his
2479,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"rifle. That was not his custom. Some fool of the _Durro Muts_, being"
2480,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"hungry, raised his voice to dispute the order to flee, and before we"
2481,A SAHIBS’ WAR,were in our saddles many shots came from the roof—from rifles thrust
2482,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"through the thatch. Upon this we rode across the valley of stones, and"
2483,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"men fired at us from the nullah behind the house, and from the hill"
2484,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"behind the nullah, as well as from the roof of the house—so many shots"
2485,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"that it sounded like a drumming in the hills. Then Sikandar Khan,"
2486,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"riding low, said, “This play is not for us alone, but for the rest of"
2487,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the _Durro Muts_,” and I said, “Be quiet. Keep place!” for his place"
2488,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"was behind me, and I rode behind Kurban Sahib. But these new bullets"
2489,A SAHIBS’ WAR,will pass through five men a-row! We were not hit—not one of us—and we
2490,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"reached the hill of rocks and scattered among the stones, and Kurban"
2491,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib turned in his saddle and said, “Look at the old man!” He stood in"
2492,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the verandah firing swiftly with a gun, the woman beside him and the"
2493,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"idiot also—both with guns. Kurban Sahib laughed, and I caught him by"
2494,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the wrist, but—his fate was written at that hour. The bullet passed"
2495,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"under my arm-pit and struck him in the liver, and I pulled him backward"
2496,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"between two great rocks atilt—Kurban Sahib, my Kurban Sahib! From the"
2497,A SAHIBS’ WAR,nullah behind the house and from the hills came our Boer-log in number
2498,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"more than a hundred, and Sikandar Khan said, “_Now_ we see the meaning"
2499,A SAHIBS’ WAR,of last night’s signal. Give me the rifle.” He took Kurban Sahib’s
2500,A SAHIBS’ WAR,rifle—in this war of fools only the doctors carry swords—and lay
2501,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"belly-flat to the work, but Kurban Sahib turned where he lay and said,"
2502,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"“Be still. It is a Sahibs’ war,” and Kurban Sahib put up his hand—thus;"
2503,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and then his eyes rolled on me, and I gave him water that he might pass"
2504,A SAHIBS’ WAR,the more quickly. And at the drinking his Spirit received permission….
2505,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2506,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Thus went our fight, Sahib. We _Durro Muts_ were on a ridge working"
2507,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"from the north to the south, where lay our main body, and the Boer-log"
2508,A SAHIBS’ WAR,lay in a valley working from east to west. There were more than a
2509,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"hundred, and our men were ten, but they held the Boer-log in the valley"
2510,A SAHIBS’ WAR,while they swiftly passed along the ridge to the south. I saw three
2511,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Boers drop in the open. Then they all hid again and fired heavily at
2512,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the rocks that hid our men; but our men were clever and did not show,"
2513,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"but moved away and away, always south; and the noise of the battle"
2514,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"withdrew itself southward, where we could hear the sound of big guns."
2515,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"So it fell stark dark, and Sikandar Khan found a deep old jackal’s"
2516,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"earth amid rocks, into which we slid the body of Kurban Sahib upright."
2517,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sikandar Khan took his glasses, and I took his handkerchief and some"
2518,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"letters and a certain thing which I knew hung round his neck, and"
2519,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sikandar Khan is witness that I wrapped them all in the handkerchief.
2520,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Then we took an oath together, and lay still and mourned for Kurban"
2521,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib. Sikandar Khan wept till daybreak—even he, a Pathan, a"
2522,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Mohammedan! All that night we heard firing to the southward, and when"
2523,A SAHIBS’ WAR,the dawn broke the valley was full of Boer-log in carts and on horses.
2524,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"They gathered by the house, as we could see through Kurban Sahib’s"
2525,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"glasses, and the old man, who, I take it, was a priest, blessed them,"
2526,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and preached the holy war, waving his arm; and the fat woman brought"
2527,A SAHIBS’ WAR,coffee; and the idiot capered among them and kissed their horses.
2528,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Presently they went away in haste; they went over the hills and were
2529,A SAHIBS’ WAR,not; and a black slave came out and washed the door-sills with bright
2530,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"water. Sikandar Khan saw through the glasses that the stain was blood,"
2531,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and he laughed, saying, “Wounded men lie there. We shall yet get"
2532,A SAHIBS’ WAR,vengeance.”
2533,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2534,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"About noon we saw a thin, high smoke to the southward, such a smoke as"
2535,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"a burning house will make in sunshine, and Sikandar Khan, who knows how"
2536,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"to take a bearing across a hill, said, “At last we have burned the"
2537,A SAHIBS’ WAR,house of the pumpkin-seller whence they signalled.” And I said: “What
2538,A SAHIBS’ WAR,need now that they have slain my child? Let me mourn.” It was a high
2539,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"smoke, and the old man, as I saw, came out into the verandah to behold"
2540,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"it, and shook his clenched hands at it. So we lay till the twilight,"
2541,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"foodless and without water, for we had vowed a vow neither to eat nor"
2542,A SAHIBS’ WAR,to drink till we had accomplished the matter. I had a little opium
2543,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"left, of which I gave Sikandar Khan the half, because he loved Kurban"
2544,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sahib. When it was full dark we sharpened our sabres upon a certain
2545,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"softish rock which, mixed with water, sharpens steel well, and we took"
2546,A SAHIBS’ WAR,off our boots and we went down to the house and looked through the
2547,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"windows very softly. The old man sat reading in a book, and the woman"
2548,A SAHIBS’ WAR,sat by the hearth; and the idiot lay on the floor with his head against
2549,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"her knee, and he counted his fingers and laughed, and she laughed"
2550,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"again. So I knew they were mother and son, and I laughed, too, for I"
2551,A SAHIBS’ WAR,had suspected this when I claimed her life and her body from Sikandar
2552,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Khan, in our discussion of the spoil. Then we entered with bare"
2553,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"swords…. Indeed, these Boer-log do not understand the steel, for the"
2554,A SAHIBS’ WAR,old man ran towards a rifle in the corner; but Sikandar Khan prevented
2555,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"him with a blow of the flat across the hands, and he sat down and held"
2556,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"up his hands, and I put my fingers on my lips to signify they should be"
2557,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"silent. But the woman cried, and one stirred in an inner room, and a"
2558,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"door opened, and a man, bound about the head with rags, stood stupidly"
2559,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"fumbling with a gun. His whole head fell inside the door, and none"
2560,A SAHIBS’ WAR,followed him. It was a very pretty stroke—for a Pathan. They then were
2561,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"silent, staring at the head upon the floor, and I said to Sikandar"
2562,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Khan, “Fetch ropes! Not even for Kurban Sahib’s sake will I defile my"
2563,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"sword.” So he went to seek and returned with three long leather ones,"
2564,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and said, “Four wounded lie within, and doubtless each has a permit"
2565,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"from a General,” and he stretched the ropes and laughed. Then I bound"
2566,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the old man’s hands behind his back, and unwillingly—for he laughed in"
2567,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"my face, and would have fingered my beard—the idiot’s. At this the"
2568,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"woman with the swine’s eyes and the jowl of a swine ran forward, and"
2569,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sikandar Khan said, “Shall I strike or bind? She was thy property on"
2570,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the division.” And I said, “Refrain! I have made a chain to hold her."
2571,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Open the door.” I pushed out the two across the verandah into the
2572,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"darker shade of the thorn-trees, and she followed upon her knees and"
2573,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"lay along the ground, and pawed at my boots and howled. Then Sikandar"
2574,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Khan bore out the lamp, saying that he was a butler and would light the"
2575,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"table, and I looked for a branch that would bear fruit. But the woman"
2576,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"hindered me not a little with her screechings and plungings, and spoke"
2577,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"fast in her tongue, and I replied in my tongue, “I am childless"
2578,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"to-night because of thy perfidy, and _my_ child was praised among men"
2579,A SAHIBS’ WAR,and loved among women. He would have begotten men—not animals. Thou
2580,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"hast more years to live than I, but my grief is the greater.”"
2581,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2582,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"I stooped to make sure the noose upon the idiot’s neck, and flung the"
2583,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"end over the branch, and Sikandar Khan held up the lamp that she might"
2584,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"well see. Then appeared suddenly, a little beyond the light of the"
2585,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"lamp, the spirit of Kurban Sahib. One hand he held to his side, even"
2586,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"where the bullet had struck him, and the other he put forward thus, and"
2587,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"said, “No. It is a Sahibs’ war.” And I said, “Wait a while, Child, and"
2588,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"thou shalt sleep.” But he came nearer, riding, as it were, upon my"
2589,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"eyes, and said, “No. It is a Sahibs’ war.” And Sikandar Khan said, “Is"
2590,A SAHIBS’ WAR,it too heavy?” and set down the lamp and came to me; and as he turned
2591,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"to tally on the rope, the spirit of Kurban Sahib stood up within arm’s"
2592,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"reach of us, and his face was very angry, and a third time he said,"
2593,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"“No. It is a Sahibs’ war.” And a little wind blew out the lamp, and I"
2594,A SAHIBS’ WAR,heard Sikandar Khan’s teeth chatter in his head.
2595,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2596,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"So we stayed side by side, the ropes in our hand, a very long while,"
2597,A SAHIBS’ WAR,for we could not shape any words. Then I heard Sikandar Khan open his
2598,A SAHIBS’ WAR,water-bottle and drink; and when his mouth was slaked he passed to me
2599,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"and said, “We are absolved from our vow.” So I drank, and together we"
2600,A SAHIBS’ WAR,waited for the dawn in that place where we stood—the ropes in our hand.
2601,A SAHIBS’ WAR,A little after third cockcrow we heard the feet of horses and gun
2602,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"wheels very far off, and so soon as the light came a shell burst on the"
2603,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"threshold of the house, and the roof of the verandah that was thatched"
2604,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"fell in and blazed before the windows. And I said, “What of the wounded"
2605,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Boer-log within?” And Sikandar Khan said, “We have heard the order. It"
2606,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"is a Sahibs’ war. Stand still.” Then came a second shell—good line, but"
2607,A SAHIBS’ WAR,short—and scattered dust upon us where we stood; and then came ten of
2608,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the little quick shells from the gun that speaks like a stammerer—yes,"
2609,A SAHIBS’ WAR,pompom the Sahibs call it—and the face of the house folded down like
2610,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the nose and the chin of an old man mumbling, and the forefront of the"
2611,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"house lay down. Then Sikandar Khan said, “If it be the fate of the"
2612,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"wounded to die in the fire, _I_ shall not prevent it.” And he passed to"
2613,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the back of the house and presently came back, and four wounded"
2614,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Boer-log came after him, of whom two could not walk upright. And I"
2615,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"said, “What hast thou done?” And he said, “I have neither spoken to"
2616,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"them nor laid hand on them. They follow in hope of mercy.” And I said,"
2617,A SAHIBS’ WAR,“It is a Sahibs’ war. Let them wait the Sahibs’ mercy.” So they lay
2618,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"still, the four men and the idiot, and the fat woman under the"
2619,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"thorn-tree, and the house burned furiously. Then began the known sound"
2620,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"of cartouches in the roof—one or two at first; then a trill, and last"
2621,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"of all one loud noise and the thatch blew here and there, and the"
2622,A SAHIBS’ WAR,captives would have crawled aside on account of the heat that was
2623,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"withering the thorn-trees, and on account of wood and bricks flying at"
2624,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"random. But I said, “Abide! Abide! Ye be Sahibs, and this is a Sahibs’"
2625,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"war, O Sahibs. There is no order that ye should depart from this war.”"
2626,A SAHIBS’ WAR,They did not understand my words. Yet they abode and they lived.
2627,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2628,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Presently rode down five troopers of Kurban Sahib’s command, and one I"
2629,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"knew spoke my tongue, having sailed to Calcutta often with horses. So I"
2630,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"told him all my tale, using bazaar-talk, such as his kidney of Sahib"
2631,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"would understand; and at the end I said, “An order has reached us here"
2632,A SAHIBS’ WAR,from the dead that this is a Sahibs’ war. I take the soul of my Kurban
2633,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sahib to witness that I give over to the justice of the Sahibs these
2634,A SAHIBS’ WAR,Sahibs who have made me childless.” Then I gave him the ropes and fell
2635,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"down senseless, my heart being very full, but my belly was empty,"
2636,A SAHIBS’ WAR,except for the little opium.
2637,A SAHIBS’ WAR,
2638,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"They put me into a cart with one of their wounded, and after a while I"
2639,A SAHIBS’ WAR,understood that they had fought against the Boer-log for two days and
2640,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"two nights. It was all one big trap, Sahib, of which we, with Kurban"
2641,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Sahib, saw no more than the outer edge. They were very angry, the"
2642,A SAHIBS’ WAR,_Durro Muts_—very angry indeed. I have never seen Sahibs so angry. They
2643,A SAHIBS’ WAR,buried my Kurban Sahib with the rites of his faith upon the top of the
2644,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"ridge overlooking the house, and I said the proper prayers of the"
2645,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"faith, and Sikandar Khan prayed in his fashion and stole five"
2646,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"signalling-candles, which have each three wicks, and lighted the grave"
2647,A SAHIBS’ WAR,as if it had been the grave of a saint on a Friday. He wept very
2648,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"bitterly all that night, and I wept with him, and he took hold of my"
2649,A SAHIBS’ WAR,feet and besought me to give him a remembrance from Kurban Sahib. So I
2650,A SAHIBS’ WAR,divided equally with him one of Kurban Sahib’s handkerchiefs—not the
2651,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"silk ones, for those were given him by a certain woman; and I also gave"
2652,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"him a button from a coat, and a little steel ring of no value that"
2653,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"Kurban Sahib used for his keys, and he kissed them and put them into"
2654,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"his bosom. The rest I have here in that little bundle, and I must get"
2655,A SAHIBS’ WAR,the baggage from the hotel in Cape Town—some four shirts we sent to be
2656,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"washed, for which we could not wait when we went up-country—and I must"
2657,A SAHIBS’ WAR,give them all to my Colonel-Sahib at Sialkote in the Punjab. For my
2658,A SAHIBS’ WAR,child is dead—my baba is dead!… I would have come away before; there
2659,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"was no need to stay, the child being dead; but we were far from the"
2660,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"rail, and the _Durro Muts_ were as brothers to me, and I had come to"
2661,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"look upon Sikandar Khan as in some sort a friend, and he got me a horse"
2662,A SAHIBS’ WAR,and I rode up and down with them; but the life had departed. God knows
2663,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"what they called me—orderly, _chaprassi_ (messenger), cook, sweeper, I"
2664,A SAHIBS’ WAR,did not know nor care. But once I had pleasure. We came back in a month
2665,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"after wide circles to that very valley. I knew it every stone, and I"
2666,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"went up to the grave, and a clever Sahib of the _Durro Muts_ (we left a"
2667,A SAHIBS’ WAR,troop there for a week to school those people with _purwanas_) had cut
2668,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"an inscription upon a great rock; and they interpreted it to me, and it"
2669,A SAHIBS’ WAR,was a jest such as Kurban Sahib himself would have loved. Oh! I have
2670,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"the inscription well copied here. Read it aloud, Sahib, and I will"
2671,A SAHIBS’ WAR,"explain the jests. There are two very good ones. Begin, Sahib:—"

2771,PART I,H.M.S. _Caryatid_ went to Portland to join Blue Fleet for manœuvres. I
2772,PART I,"travelled overland from London by way of Portsmouth, where I fell among"

2776,PART I,"filled with Red Fleet, my official enemies and joyous acquaintances,"
2777,PART I,"who received me with unstinted hospitality. For example,"
2778,PART I,"Lieutenant-Commander A. L. Hignett, in charge of three destroyers,"
2779,PART I,"_Wraith, Stiletto_, and _Kobbold_, due to depart at 6 P.M. that"
2780,PART I,"evening, offered me a berth on his thirty-knot flagship, but I"
2781,PART I,"preferred my comforts, and so accepted sleeping-room in H.M.S."
2782,PART I,"_Pedantic_ (15,000 tons), leader of the second line. After dining"
2783,PART I,"aboard her I took boat to Weymouth to get my kit aboard, as the"
2784,PART I,battleships would go to war at midnight. In transferring my allegiance
2785,PART I,"from Blue to Red Fleet, whatever the Marine Captain may say, I did no"
2786,PART I,wrong. I truly intended to return to the _Pedantic_ and help to fight
2787,PART I,"Blue Fleet. All I needed was a new toothbrush, which I bought from a"
2788,PART I,"chemist in a side street at 9:15 P.M. As I turned to go, one entered"
2789,PART I,"seeking alleviation of a gum-boil. He was dressed in a checked ulster,"
2790,PART I,"a black silk hat three sizes too small, cord-breeches, boots, and pure"
2791,PART I,"brass spurs. These he managed painfully, stepping like a prisoner fresh"
2792,PART I,from leg-irons. As he adjusted the pepper-plaster to the gum the light
2793,PART I,"fell on his face, and I recognised Mr. Emanuel Pyecroft, late"
2794,PART I,"second-class petty officer of H.M.S. _Archimandrite_, an unforgettable"
2795,PART I,"man, met a year before under Tom Wessel’s roof in Plymouth. It occurred"
2796,PART I,to me that when a petty officer takes to spurs he may conceivably
2797,PART I,"meditate desertion. For that reason I, though a taxpayer, made no sign."
2798,PART I,"Indeed, it was Mr. Pyecroft, following me out of the shop, who said"
2799,PART I,hollowly: “What might you be doing here?”
2800,PART I,
2801,PART I,"“I’m going on manœuvres in the _Pedantic_,” I replied."
2802,PART I,
2803,PART I,“Ho!” said Mr. Pyecroft. “An’ what manner o’ manœuvres d’you expect to
2804,PART I,see in a blighted cathedral like the _Pedantic_? _I_ know ’er. I knew
2805,PART I,"her in Malta, when the _Vulcan_ was her permanent tender. Manoeuvres!"
2806,PART I,You won’t see more than ‘Man an’ arm watertight doors!’ in your little
2807,PART I,woollen undervest.”
2808,PART I,
2809,PART I,“I’m sorry for that.”
2810,PART I,
2811,PART I,“Why?” He lurched heavily as his spurs caught and twanged like
2812,PART I,tuning-forks. “War’s declared at midnight. _Pedantics_ be sugared! Buy
2813,PART I,an ’am an’ see life!”
2814,PART I,
2815,PART I,"For the moment I fancied Mr. Pyecroft, a fugitive from justice,"
2816,PART I,purposed that we two should embrace a Robin Hood career in the uplands
2817,PART I,"of Dorset. The spurs troubled me, and I made bold to say as much."
2818,PART I,"“Them!” he said, coming to an intricate halt. “They’re part of the"
2819,PART I,_prima facie_ evidence. But as for me—let me carry your bag—I’m second
2820,PART I,"in command, leadin’-hand, cook, steward, an’ lavatory man, with a few"
2821,PART I,"incidentals for sixpence a day extra, on No. 267 torpedo-boat.”"
2822,PART I,
2823,PART I,“They wear spurs there?”
2824,PART I,
2825,PART I,"“Well,” said Mr. Peycroft, “seein’ that Two Six Seven belongs to Blue"
2826,PART I,"Fleet, which left the day before yesterday, disguises are imperative."
2827,PART I,It transpired thus. The Right Honourable Lord Gawd Almighty Admiral
2828,PART I,"Master Frankie Frobisher, K.C.B., commandin’ Blue Fleet, can’t be"
2829,PART I,bothered with one tin-torpedo-boat more or less; and what with lyin’ in
2830,PART I,"the Reserve four years, an’ what with the new kind o’ tiffy which"
2831,PART I,cleans dynamos with brick-dust and oil (Blast these spurs! They won’t
2832,PART I,"render!), Two Six Seven’s steam-gadgets was paralytic. Our Mr. Moorshed"
2833,PART I,"done his painstakin’ best—it’s his first command of a war-canoe, matoor"
2834,PART I,"age nineteen (down that alleyway, please!) but be that as it may, His"
2835,PART I,Holiness Frankie is aware of us crabbin’ ourselves round the breakwater
2836,PART I,"at five knots, an’ steerin’ _pari passu_, as the French say. (Up this"
2837,PART I,"alley-way, please!) If he’d given Mr. Hinchcliffe, our chief engineer,"
2838,PART I,"a little time, it would never have transpired, for what Hinch can’t"
2839,PART I,"drive he can coax; but the new port bein’ a trifle cloudy, an’ ’is"
2840,PART I,"joints tinglin’ after a post-captain dinner, Frankie come on the upper"
2841,PART I,"bridge seekin’ for a sacrifice. We, offerin’ a broadside target, got"
2842,PART I,"it. He told us what ’is grandmamma, ’oo was a lady an’ went to sea in"
2843,PART I,"stick- and string-batteaus, had told him about steam. He throwed in his"
2844,PART I,own prayers for the ’ealth an’ safety of all steam-packets an’ their
2845,PART I,officers. Then he give us several distinct orders. The first few—I kept
2846,PART I,tally—was all about going to Hell; the next many was about not
2847,PART I,"evolutin’ in his company, when there; an’ the last all was simply"
2848,PART I,repeatin’ the motions in quick time. Knowin’ Frankie’s groovin’ to be
2849,PART I,"badly eroded by age and lack of attention, I didn’t much panic; but our"
2850,PART I,"Mr. Moorshed, ’e took it a little to heart. Me an’ Mr. Hinchcliffe"
2851,PART I,"consoled ’im as well as service conditions permits of, an’ we had a"
2852,PART I,_résumé_-supper at the back o’ the Camber—secluded _an’_ lugubrious!
2853,PART I,"Then one thing leadin’ up to another, an’ our orders, except about"
2854,PART I,"anchorin’ where he’s booked for, leavin’ us a clear ’orizon, Number Two"
2855,PART I,Six Seven is now—mind the edge of the wharf—here!”
2856,PART I,
2857,PART I,By mysterious doublings he had brought me out on to the edge of a
2858,PART I,narrow strip of water crowded with coastwise shipping that runs far up
2859,PART I,"into Weymouth town. A large foreign timber-brig lay at my feet, and"
2860,PART I,"under the round of her stern cowered, close to the wharf-edge, a"
2861,PART I,"slate-coloured, unkempt, two-funnelled craft of a type—but I am no"
2862,PART I,expert—between the first-class torpedo-boat and the full-blooded
2863,PART I,"destroyer. From her archaic torpedo-tubes at the stern, and"
2864,PART I,"quick-firers forward and amidship, she must have dated from the early"
2865,PART I,"nineties. Hammerings and clinkings, with spurts of steam and fumes of"
2866,PART I,"hot oil, arose from her inside, and a figure in a striped jersey"
2867,PART I,squatted on the engine-room gratings.
2868,PART I,
2869,PART I,"“She ain’t much of a war-canoe, but you’ll see more life in ’er than on"
2870,PART I,an whole squadron of bleedin’ _Pedantics.”_
2871,PART I,
2872,PART I,"“But she’s laid up here—and Blue Fleet have gone,” I protested."
2873,PART I,"“Precisely. Only, in his comprehensive orders Frankie didn’t put us out"
2874,PART I,of action. Thus we’re a non-neglectable fightin’ factor which you
2875,PART I,"mightn’t think from this elevation; _an’_ m’rover, Red Fleet don’t know"
2876,PART I,we’re ’ere. Most of us”—he glanced proudly at his boots—“didn’t run to
2877,PART I,"spurs, but we’re disguised pretty devious, as you might say. Morgan,"
2878,PART I,"our signaliser, when last seen, was a Dawlish bathing-machine"
2879,PART I,"proprietor. Hinchcliffe was naturally a German waiter, and me you"
2880,PART I,behold as a squire of low degree; while yonder Levantine dragoman on
2881,PART I,the hatch is our Mr. Moorshed. He was the second cutter’s snotty—_my_
2882,PART I,snotty—on the _Archimandrite_—two years—Cape Station. Likewise on the
2883,PART I,"West Coast, mangrove swampin’, an’ gettin’ the cutter stove in on small"
2884,PART I,"an’ unlikely bars, an’ manufacturin’ lies to correspond. What I don’t"
2885,PART I,know about Mr. Moorshed is precisely the same gauge as what Mr.
2886,PART I,"Moorshed don’t know about me—half a millimetre, as you might say. He"
2887,PART I,comes into awful opulence of his own when ’e’s of age; an’ judgin’ from
2888,PART I,"what passed between us when Frankie cursed ’im, I don’t think ’e cares"
2889,PART I,whether he’s broke to-morrow or—the day after. Are you beginnin’ to
2890,PART I,follow our tattics? They’ll be worth followin’. Or _are_ you goin’ back
2891,PART I,to your nice little cabin on the _Pedantic_—which I lay they’ve just
2892,PART I,"dismounted the third engineer out of—to eat four fat meals per diem,"
2893,PART I,an’ smoke in the casement?”
2894,PART I,
2895,PART I,The figure in the jersey lifted its head and mumbled.
2896,PART I,
2897,PART I,"“Yes, Sir,” was Mr. Pyecroft’s answer. “I ’ave ascertained that"
2898,PART I,"_Stiletto, Wraith_, and _Kobbold_ left at 6 P.M. with the first"
2899,PART I,"division o’ Red Fleet’s cruisers except _Devolotion_ and _Cryptic_,"
2900,PART I,which are delayed by engine-room defects.” Then to me: “Won’t you go
2901,PART I,aboard? Mr. Moorshed ’ud like some one to talk to. You buy an ’am an’
2902,PART I,see life.”
2903,PART I,
2904,PART I,At this he vanished; and the Demon of Pure Irresponsibility bade me
2905,PART I,lower myself from the edge of the wharf to the tea-tray plates of No.
2906,PART I,267.
2907,PART I,
2908,PART I,“What d’you want?” said the striped jersey.
2909,PART I,
2910,PART I,"“I want to join Blue Fleet if I can,” I replied. “I’ve been left behind"
2911,PART I,by—an accident.”
2912,PART I,
2913,PART I,“Well?”
2914,PART I,
2915,PART I,“Mr. Pyecroft told me to buy a ham and see life. About how big a ham do
2916,PART I,you need?”
2917,PART I,
2918,PART I,"“I don’t want any ham, thank you. That’s the way up the wharf."
2919,PART I,_Good_-night.”
2920,PART I,
2921,PART I,"“Good-night!” I retraced my steps, wandered in the dark till I found a"
2922,PART I,"shop, and there purchased, of sardines, canned tongue, lobster, and"
2923,PART I,"salmon, not less than half a hundredweight. A belated sausage-shop"
2924,PART I,supplied me with a partially cut ham of pantomime tonnage. These things
2925,PART I,"I, sweating, bore out to the edge of the wharf and set down in the"
2926,PART I,"shadow of a crane. It was a clear, dark summer night, and from time to"
2927,PART I,time I laughed happily to myself. The adventure was preordained on the
2928,PART I,"face of it. Pyecroft alone, spurred or barefoot, would have drawn me"
2929,PART I,very far from the paths of circumspection. His advice to buy a ham and
2930,PART I,see life clinched it. Presently Mr. Pyecroft—I heard spurs clink—passed
2931,PART I,me. Then the jersey voice said: “What the mischief’s that?”
2932,PART I,
2933,PART I,"“’Asn’t the visitor come aboard, Sir? ’E told me he’d purposely"
2934,PART I,abandoned the _Pedantic_ for the pleasure of the trip with us. Told me
2935,PART I,he was official correspondent for the _Times_; an’ I know he’s littery
2936,PART I,"by the way ’e tries to talk Navy-talk. Haven’t you seen ’im, Sir?”"
2937,PART I,
2938,PART I,"Slowly and dispassionately the answer drawled long on the night; “Pye,"
2939,PART I,you are without exception the biggest liar in the Service!”
2940,PART I,
2941,PART I,"“Then what am I to do with the bag, Sir? It’s marked with his name.”"
2942,PART I,There was a pause till Mr. Moorshed said “Oh!” in a tone which the
2943,PART I,listener might construe precisely as he pleased.
2944,PART I,
2945,PART I,“_He_ was the maniac who wanted to buy a ham and see life—was he? If he
2946,PART I,goes back to the _Pedantic_—”
2947,PART I,
2948,PART I,"“Pre-cisely, Sir. Gives us all away, Sir.”"
2949,PART I,
2950,PART I,"“Then what possessed _you_ to give it away to him, you owl?”"
2951,PART I,
2952,PART I,"“I’ve got his bag. If ’e gives anything away, he’ll have to go naked.”"
2953,PART I,
2954,PART I,At this point I thought it best to rattle my tins and step out of the
2955,PART I,shadow of the crane.
2956,PART I,
2957,PART I,"“I’ve bought the ham,” I called sweetly. “Have you still any objection"
2958,PART I,"to my seeing life, Mr. Moorshed?”"
2959,PART I,
2960,PART I,"“All right, if you’re insured. Won’t you come down?”"
2961,PART I,
2962,PART I,"I descended; Pyecroft, by a silent flank movement, possessing himself"
2963,PART I,"of all the provisions, which he bore to some hole forward."
2964,PART I,
2965,PART I,“Have you known Mr. Pyecroft long?” said my host.
2966,PART I,
2967,PART I,"“Met him once, a year ago, at Devonport. What do you think of him?”"
2968,PART I,
2969,PART I,“What do _you_ think of him?”
2970,PART I,
2971,PART I,“I’ve left the _Pedantic_—her boat will be waiting for me at ten
2972,PART I,"o’clock, too—simply because I happened to meet him,” I replied."
2973,PART I,
2974,PART I,"“That’s all right. If you’ll come down below, we may get some grub.”"
2975,PART I,
2976,PART I,"We descended a naked steel ladder to a steel-beamed tunnel, perhaps"
2977,PART I,twelve feet long by six high. Leather-topped lockers ran along either
2978,PART I,"side; a swinging table, with tray and lamp above, occupied the centre."
2979,PART I,Other furniture there was none.
2980,PART I,
2981,PART I,"“You can’t shave here, of course. We don’t wash, and, as a rule, we eat"
2982,PART I,with our fingers when we’re at sea. D’you mind?”
2983,PART I,
2984,PART I,"Mr. Moorshed, black-haired, black-browed, sallow-complexioned, looked"
2985,PART I,"me over from head to foot and grinned. He was not handsome in any way,"
2986,PART I,but his smile drew the heart. “You didn’t happen to hear what Frankie
2987,PART I,"told me from the flagship, did you? His last instructions, and I’ve"
2988,PART I,"logged them here in shorthand, were”—he opened a neat"
2989,PART I,pocket-book—”_‘Get out of this and conduct your own damned manœuvres in
2990,PART I,"your own damned tinker fashion! You’re a disgrace to the Service, and"
2991,PART I,your boat’s offal.’”_
2992,PART I,
2993,PART I,“Awful?” I said.
2994,PART I,
2995,PART I,"“No—offal—tripes—swipes—ullage.” Mr. Pyecroft entered, in the costume"
2996,PART I,"of his calling, with the ham and an assortment of tin dishes, which he"
2997,PART I,dealt out like cards.
2998,PART I,
2999,PART I,"“I shall take these as my orders,” said Mr. Moorshed. “I’m chucking the"
3000,PART I,"Service at the end of the year, so it doesn’t matter.”"
3001,PART I,
3002,PART I,"We cut into the ham under the ill-trimmed lamp, washed it down with"
3003,PART I,"whisky, and then smoked. From the foreside of the bulkhead came an"
3004,PART I,"uninterrupted hammering and clinking, and now and then a hiss of steam."
3005,PART I,
3006,PART I,"“That’s Mr. Hinchcliffe,” said Pyecroft. “He’s what is called a"
3007,PART I,first-class engine-room artificer. If you hand ’im a drum of oil an’
3008,PART I,"leave ’im alone, he can coax a stolen bicycle to do typewritin’.”"
3009,PART I,
3010,PART I,"Very leisurely, at the end of his first pipe, Mr. Moorshed drew out a"
3011,PART I,"folded map, cut from a newspaper, of the area of manœuvres, with the"
3012,PART I,"rules that regulate these wonderful things, below."
3013,PART I,
3014,PART I,"“Well, I suppose I know as much as an average stick-and-string"
3015,PART I,"admiral,” he said, yawning. “Is our petticoat ready yet, Mr. Pyecroft?”"
3016,PART I,
3017,PART I,As a preparation for naval manœuvres these councils seemed inadequate.
3018,PART I,I followed up the ladder into the gloom cast by the wharf edge and the
3019,PART I,big lumber-ship’s side. As my eyes stretched to the darkness I saw that
3020,PART I,"No. 267 had miraculously sprouted an extra pair of funnels—soft, for"
3021,PART I,they gave as I touched them.
3022,PART I,
3023,PART I,"“More _prima facie_ evidence. You runs a rope fore an’ aft, an’ you"
3024,PART I,"erects perpendick-u-arly two canvas tubes, which you distends with cane"
3025,PART I,"hoops, thus ’avin’ as many funnels as a destroyer. At the word o’"
3026,PART I,"command, up they go like a pair of concertinas, an’ consequently"
3027,PART I,collapses equally ’andy when requisite. Comin’ aft we shall doubtless
3028,PART I,overtake the Dawlish bathin’-machine proprietor fittin’ on her bustle.”
3029,PART I,
3030,PART I,Mr. Pyecroft whispered this in my ear as Moorshed moved toward a group
3031,PART I,at the stern.
3032,PART I,
3033,PART I,"“None of us who ain’t built that way can be destroyers, but we can look"
3034,PART I,"as near it as we can. Let me explain to you, Sir, that the stern of a"
3035,PART I,"Thorneycroft boat, which we are _not_, comes out in a pretty bulge,"
3036,PART I,"totally different from the Yarrow mark, which again we are not. But, on"
3037,PART I,"the other ’and, _Dirk, Stiletto, Goblin, Ghoul, Djinn_, and"
3038,PART I,"_A-frite_—Red Fleet dee-stroyers, with ’oom we hope to consort later on"
3039,PART I,"terms o’ perfect equality—_are_ Thorneycrofts, an’ carry that Grecian"
3040,PART I,bend which we are now adjustin’ to our _arriere-pensée_—as the French
3041,PART I,would put it—by means of painted canvas an’ iron rods bent as
3042,PART I,"requisite. Between you an’ me an’ Frankie, we are the _Gnome_, now in"
3043,PART I,"the Fleet Reserve at Pompey—Portsmouth, I should say.”"
3044,PART I,
3045,PART I,"“The first sea will carry it all away,” said Moorshed, leaning gloomily"
3046,PART I,"outboard, “but it will do for the present.”"
3047,PART I,
3048,PART I,"“We’ve a lot of _prima facie_ evidence about us,” Mr. Pyecroft went on."
3049,PART I,“A first-class torpedo boat sits lower in the water than a destroyer.
3050,PART I,Hence we artificially raise our sides with a black canvas wash-streak
3051,PART I,to represent extra freeboard; _at_ the same time paddin’ out the cover
3052,PART I,"of the forward three-pounder like as if it was a twelve-pounder, an’"
3053,PART I,"variously fakin’ up the bows of ’er. As you might say, we’ve took"
3054,PART I,thought an’ added a cubic to our stature. It’s our len’th that sugars
3055,PART I,"us. A ’undred an’ forty feet, which is our len’th into two ’undred and"
3056,PART I,"ten, which is about the _Gnome’s,_ leaves seventy feet over, which we"
3057,PART I,haven’t got.”
3058,PART I,
3059,PART I,"“Is this all your own notion, Mr. Pyecroft?” I asked."
3060,PART I,
3061,PART I,"“In spots, you might say—yes; though we all contributed to make up"
3062,PART I,"deficiencies. But Mr. Moorshed, not much carin’ for further Navy after"
3063,PART I,"what Frankie said, certainly threw himself into the part with avidity.”"
3064,PART I,
3065,PART I,“What the dickens are we going to do?”
3066,PART I,
3067,PART I,"“Speaking as a seaman gunner, I should say we’d wait till the sights"
3068,PART I,"came on, an’ then fire. Speakin’ as a torpedo-coxswain, L.T.O., T.I.,"
3069,PART I,"M.D., etc., I presume we fall in—Number One in rear of the tube, etc.,"
3070,PART I,"secure tube to ball or diaphragm, clear away securin’-bar, release"
3071,PART I,"safety-pin from lockin-levers, an’ pray Heaven to look down on us. As"
3072,PART I,"second in command o’ 267, I say wait an’ see!”"
3073,PART I,
3074,PART I,"“What’s happened? We’re off,” I said. The timber ship had slid away"
3075,PART I,from us.
3076,PART I,
3077,PART I,"“We are. Stern first, an’ broadside on! If we don’t hit anything too"
3078,PART I,"hard, we’ll do.”"
3079,PART I,
3080,PART I,"“Come on the bridge,” said Mr. Moorshed. I saw no bridge, but fell over"
3081,PART I,"some sort of conning-tower forward, near which was a wheel. For the"
3082,PART I,next few minutes I was more occupied with cursing my own folly than
3083,PART I,with the science of navigation. Therefore I cannot say how we got out
3084,PART I,"of Weymouth Harbour, nor why it was necessary to turn sharp to the left"
3085,PART I,and wallow in what appeared to be surf.
3086,PART I,
3087,PART I,"“Excuse me,” said Mr. Pyecroft behind us, “_I_ don’t mind rammin’ a"
3088,PART I,bathin’-machine; but if only _one_ of them week-end Weymouth blighters
3089,PART I,"has thrown his empty baccy-tin into the sea here, we’ll rip our plates"
3090,PART I,open on it; 267 isn’t the _Archimandrite’s_ old cutter.”
3091,PART I,
3092,PART I,"“I am hugging the shore,” was the answer."
3093,PART I,
3094,PART I,"“There’s no actual ’arm in huggin’, but it can come expensive if"
3095,PART I,pursooed.”
3096,PART I,
3097,PART I,"“Right-O!” said Moorshed, putting down the wheel, and as we left those"
3098,PART I,scant waters I felt 267 move more freely.
3099,PART I,
3100,PART I,A thin cough ran up the speaking-tube.
3101,PART I,
3102,PART I,"“Well, what is it, Mr. Hinchcliffe?” said Moorshed."
3103,PART I,
3104,PART I,"“I merely wished to report that she is still continuin’ to go, Sir.”"
3105,PART I,
3106,PART I,"“Right-O! Can we whack her up to fifteen, d’you think?”"
3107,PART I,
3108,PART I,"“I’ll try, Sir; but we’d prefer to have the engine-room hatch open—at"
3109,PART I,"first, Sir.”"
3110,PART I,
3111,PART I,"Whacked up then she was, and for half an hour was careered largely"
3112,PART I,"through the night, turning at last with a suddenness that slung us"
3113,PART I,across the narrow deck.
3114,PART I,
3115,PART I,"“This,” said Mr. Pyecroft, who received me on his chest as a large rock"
3116,PART I,"receives a shadow, “represents the _Gnome_ arrivin’ cautious from the"
3117,PART I,"direction o’ Portsmouth, with Admiralty orders.”"
3118,PART I,
3119,PART I,"He pointed through the darkness ahead, and after much staring my eyes"
3120,PART I,"opened to a dozen destroyers, in two lines, some few hundred yards"
3121,PART I,away.
3122,PART I,
3123,PART I,"“Those are the Red Fleet destroyer flotilla, which is too frail to"
3124,PART I,"panic about among the full-blooded cruisers inside Portland breakwater,"
3125,PART I,and several millimetres too excited over the approachin’ war to keep a
3126,PART I,look-out inshore. Hence our tattics!”
3127,PART I,
3128,PART I,"We wailed through our siren—a long, malignant, hyena-like howl—and a"
3129,PART I,voice hailed us as we went astern tumultuously.
3130,PART I,
3131,PART I,"“The _Gnome_—Carteret-Jones—from Portsmouth, with"
3132,PART I,"orders—mm—mm—_Stiletto_,” Moorshed answered through the megaphone in a"
3133,PART I,"high, whining voice, rather like a chaplain’s."
3134,PART I,
3135,PART I,“_Who_?” was the answer.
3136,PART I,
3137,PART I,“Carter—et—Jones.”
3138,PART I,
3139,PART I,"“Oh, Lord!”"
3140,PART I,
3141,PART I,"There was a pause; a voice cried to some friend, “It’s Podgie, adrift"
3142,PART I,on the high seas in charge of a whole dee-stroyer!”
3143,PART I,
3144,PART I,"Another voice echoed, “Podgie!” and from its note I gathered that Mr."
3145,PART I,"Carteret-Jones had a reputation, but not for independent command."
3146,PART I,
3147,PART I,"“Who’s your sub?” said the first speaker, a shadow on the bridge of the"
3148,PART I,_Dirk_.
3149,PART I,
3150,PART I,"“A gunner, at present, Sir. The _Stiletto_—broken down—turns over to"
3151,PART I,us.”
3152,PART I,
3153,PART I,“When did the _Stiletto_ break down?”
3154,PART I,
3155,PART I,"“Off the Start, Sir; two hours after—after she left here this evening,"
3156,PART I,I believe. My orders are to report to you for the manœuvre
3157,PART I,"signal-codes, and join Commander Hignett’s flotilla, which is in"
3158,PART I,attendance on _Stiletto_.”
3159,PART I,
3160,PART I,A smothered chuckle greeted this last. Moorshed’s voice was high and
3161,PART I,"uneasy. Said Pyecroft, with a sigh: “The amount o’ trouble me an’ my"
3162,PART I,bright spurs ’ad fishin’ out that information from torpedo coxswains
3163,PART I,"and similar blighters in pubs all this afternoon, you would never"
3164,PART I,believe.”
3165,PART I,
3166,PART I,“But has the _Stiletto_ broken down?” I asked weakly.
3167,PART I,
3168,PART I,"“How else are we to get Red Fleet’s private signal-code? Any way, if"
3169,PART I,"she ’asn’t now, she will before manœuvres are ended. It’s only"
3170,PART I,executin’ in anticipation.”
3171,PART I,
3172,PART I,"“Go astern and send your coxswain aboard for orders, Mr. Jones.” Water"
3173,PART I,"carries sound well, but I do not know whether we were intended to hear"
3174,PART I,the next sentence: “They must have given him _one_ intelligent keeper.”
3175,PART I,
3176,PART I,"“That’s me,” said Mr. Pyecroft, as a black and coal-stained dinghy—I"
3177,PART I,did not foresee how well I should come to know her—was flung overside
3178,PART I,by three men.
3179,PART I,
3180,PART I,"“Havin’ bought an ’am, we will now see life.” He stepped into the boat"
3181,PART I,and was away.
3182,PART I,
3183,PART I,"“I say, Podgie!”—the speaker was in the last of the line of destroyers,"
3184,PART I,as we thumped astern—“aren’t you lonely out there?”
3185,PART I,
3186,PART I,"“Oh, don’t rag me!” said Moorshed. “Do you suppose I’ll have to"
3187,PART I,manœuvre with your flo-tilla?”
3188,PART I,
3189,PART I,"“No, Podgie! I’m pretty sure our commander will see you sifting cinders"
3190,PART I,in Tophet before you come with our flo-tilla.”
3191,PART I,
3192,PART I,“Thank you! She steers rather wild at high speeds.”
3193,PART I,
3194,PART I,Two men laughed together.
3195,PART I,
3196,PART I,"“By the way, who is Mr. Carteret-Jones when he’s at home?” I whispered."
3197,PART I,
3198,PART I,"“I was with him in the _Britannia_. I didn’t like him much, but I’m"
3199,PART I,grateful to him now. I must tell him so some day.”
3200,PART I,
3201,PART I,“They seemed to know him hereabouts.”
3202,PART I,
3203,PART I,“He rammed the _Caryatid_ twice with her own steam-pinnace.”
3204,PART I,
3205,PART I,"Presently, moved by long strokes, Mr. Pyecroft returned, skimming"
3206,PART I,"across the dark. The dinghy swung up behind him, even as his heel"
3207,PART I,spurned it.
3208,PART I,
3209,PART I,"“Commander Fasset’s compliments to Mr. L. Carteret-Jones, and the"
3210,PART I,sooner he digs out in pursuance of Admiralty orders as received at
3211,PART I,"Portsmouth, the better pleased Commander Fasset will be. But there’s a"
3212,PART I,lot more——”
3213,PART I,
3214,PART I,"“Whack her up, Mr. Hinchcliffe! Come on to the bridge. We can settle it"
3215,PART I,as we go. Well?”
3216,PART I,
3217,PART I,"Mr. Pyecroft drew an important breath, and slid off his cap."
3218,PART I,
3219,PART I,"“Day an’ night private signals of Red Fleet _com_plete, Sir!” He handed"
3220,PART I,"a little paper to Moorshed. “You see, Sir, the trouble was, that Mr."
3221,PART I,"Carteret-Jones bein’, so to say, a little new to his duties, ’ad forgot"
3222,PART I,"to give ’is gunner his Admiralty orders in writin’, but, as I told"
3223,PART I,"Commander Fasset, Mr. Jones had been repeatin’ ’em to me, nervous-like,"
3224,PART I,"most of the way from Portsmouth, so I knew ’em by heart—an’ better. The"
3225,PART I,"Commander, recognisin’ in me a man of agility, cautioned me to be a"
3226,PART I,father an’ mother to Mr. Carteret-Jones.”
3227,PART I,
3228,PART I,"“Didn’t he know you?” I asked, thinking for the moment that there could"
3229,PART I,be no duplicates of Emanuel Pyecroft in the Navy.
3230,PART I,
3231,PART I,“What’s a torpedo-gunner more or less to a full lootenant commanding
3232,PART I,six thirty-knot destroyers for the first time? ’E seemed to cherish the
3233,PART I,’ope that ’e might use the _Gnome_ for ’is own ’orrible purposes; but
3234,PART I,"what I told him about Mr. Jones’s sad lack o’ nerve comin’ from Pompey,"
3235,PART I,"an’ going dead slow on account of the dark, short-circuited _that_"
3236,PART I,"connection. ‘M’rover,’ I says to him, ‘our orders is explicit;"
3237,PART I,"_Stiletto’s_ reported broke down somewhere off the Start, an’ we’ve"
3238,PART I,"been tryin’ to coil down a new stiff wire hawser all the evenin’, so it"
3239,PART I,"looks like towin’ ’er back, don’t it?’ I says. That more than ever jams"
3240,PART I,"his turrets, an’ makes him keen to get rid of us. ’E even hinted that"
3241,PART I,Mr. Carteret-Jones passin’ hawsers an’ assistin’ the impotent in a
3242,PART I,sea-way might come pretty expensive on the tax-payer. I agreed in a
3243,PART I,disciplined way. I ain’t proud. Gawd knows I ain’t proud! But when I’m
3244,PART I,"really diggin’ out in the fancy line, I sometimes think that me in a"
3245,PART I,"copper punt, single-’anded, ’ud beat a cutter-full of De Rougemongs in"
3246,PART I,a row round the fleet.”
3247,PART I,
3248,PART I,"At this point I reclined without shame on Mr. Pyecroft’s bosom,"
3249,PART I,supported by his quivering arm.
3250,PART I,
3251,PART I,"“Well?” said Moorshed, scowling into the darkness, as 267’s bows"
3252,PART I,"snapped at the shore seas of the broader Channel, and we swayed"
3253,PART I,together.
3254,PART I,
3255,PART I,"“‘You’d better go on,’ says Commander Fassett, ‘an’ do what you’re told"
3256,PART I,to do. I don’t envy Hignett if he has to dry-nurse the _Gnome’s_
3257,PART I,commander. But what d’you want with signals?’ ’e says. ‘It’s criminal
3258,PART I,lunacy to trust Mr. Jones with anything that steams.’
3259,PART I,
3260,PART I,"“‘May I make an observation, Sir?’ I says. ‘Suppose,’ I says, ‘you was"
3261,PART I,"torpedo-gunner on the _Gnome_, an’ Mr. Carteret-Jones was your"
3262,PART I,"commandin’ officer, an’ you had your reputation _as_ a second in"
3263,PART I,"command for the first time,’ I says, well knowin’ it was his first"
3264,PART I,"command of a flotilla, ‘what ’ud you do, Sir?’ That gouged ’is"
3265,PART I,unprotected ends open—clear back to the citadel.”
3266,PART I,
3267,PART I,“What did he say?” Moorshed jerked over his shoulder.
3268,PART I,
3269,PART I,"“If you were Mr. Carteret-Jones, it might be disrespect for me to"
3270,PART I,"repeat it, Sir.”"
3271,PART I,
3272,PART I,"“Go ahead,” I heard the boy chuckle."
3273,PART I,
3274,PART I,“‘Do?’ ’e says. ‘I’d rub the young blighter’s nose into it till I made
3275,PART I,"a perishin’ man of him, or a perspirin’ pillow-case,’ ’e says, ‘which,’"
3276,PART I,"he adds, ‘is forty per cent, more than he is at present.’"
3277,PART I,
3278,PART I,“Whilst he’s gettin’ the private signals—they’re rather particular
3279,PART I,ones—I went forrard to see the _Dirk’s_ gunner about borrowin’ a
3280,PART I,"holdin’-down bolt for our twelve-pounder. My open ears, while I was"
3281,PART I,"rovin’ over his packet, got the followin’ authentic particulars.” I"
3282,PART I,"heard his voice change, and his feet shifted. “There’s been a last"
3283,PART I,"council o’ war of destroyer-captains at the flagship, an’ a lot of"
3284,PART I,"things ’as come out. To begin with _Cryptic_ and _Devolution_, Captain"
3285,PART I,Panke and Captain Malan—”
3286,PART I,
3287,PART I,"“_Cryptic_ and _Devolution_, first-class cruisers,” said Mr. Moorshed"
3288,PART I,"dreamily. “Go on, Pyecroft.”"
3289,PART I,
3290,PART I,"“—bein’ delayed by minor defects in engine-room, did _not_, as we know,"
3291,PART I,"accompany Red Fleet’s first division of scouting cruisers, whose"
3292,PART I,"rendezvous is unknown, but presumed to be somewhere off the Lizard."
3293,PART I,_Cryptic_ an’ _Devolution_ left at 9:30 P.M. still reportin’ copious
3294,PART I,minor defects in engine-room. Admiral’s final instructions was they was
3295,PART I,"to put into Torbay, an’ mend themselves there. If they can do it in"
3296,PART I,"twenty-four hours, they’re to come on and join the battle squadron at"
3297,PART I,"the first rendezvous, down Channel somewhere. (I couldn’t get that,"
3298,PART I,"Sir.) If they can’t, he’ll think about sendin’ them some destroyers for"
3299,PART I,escort. But his present intention is to go ’ammer and tongs down
3300,PART I,"Channel, usin’ ’is destroyers for all they’re worth, an’ thus keepin’"
3301,PART I,Blue Fleet too busy off the Irish coast to sniff into any eshtuaries.”
3302,PART I,
3303,PART I,"“But if those cruisers are crocks, why does the Admiral let ’em out of"
3304,PART I,Weymouth at all?” I asked.
3305,PART I,
3306,PART I,"“The tax-payer,” said Mr. Moorshed."
3307,PART I,
3308,PART I,"“An’ newspapers,” added Mr. Pyecroft. “In Torbay they’ll look as they"
3309,PART I,was muckin’ about for strategical purposes—hammerin’ like blazes in the
3310,PART I,"engine room all the weary day, an’ the skipper droppin’ questions down"
3311,PART I,the engine-room hatch every two or three minutes. _I’ve_ been there.
3312,PART I,"Now, Sir?” I saw the white of his eye turn broad on Mr. Moorshed."
3313,PART I,
3314,PART I,The boy dropped his chin over the speaking-tube.
3315,PART I,
3316,PART I,"“Mr. Hinchcliffe, what’s her extreme economical radius?”"
3317,PART I,
3318,PART I,"“Three hundred and forty knots, down to swept bunkers.”"
3319,PART I,
3320,PART I,"“Can do,” said Moorshed. “By the way, have her revolutions any bearing"
3321,PART I,"on her speed, Mr. Hinchcliffe?”"
3322,PART I,
3323,PART I,"“None that I can make out yet, Sir.”"
3324,PART I,
3325,PART I,"“Then slow to eight knots. We’ll jog down to forty-nine, forty-five, or"
3326,PART I,"four about, and three east. That puts us say forty miles from Torbay by"
3327,PART I,nine o’clock to-morrow morning. We’ll have to muck about till dusk
3328,PART I,before we run in and try our luck with the cruisers.”
3329,PART I,
3330,PART I,"“Yes, Sir. Their picket boats will be panickin’ round them all night."
3331,PART I,It’s considered good for the young gentlemen.”
3332,PART I,
3333,PART I,“Hallo! War’s declared! They’re off!” said Moorshed.
3334,PART I,
3335,PART I,He swung 267’s head round to get a better view. A few miles to our
3336,PART I,"right the low horizon was spangled with small balls of fire, while"
3337,PART I,nearer ran a procession of tiny cigar ends.
3338,PART I,
3339,PART I,"“Red hot! Set ’em alight,” said Mr. Pyecroft. “That’s the second"
3340,PART I,destroyer flotilla diggin’ out for Commander Fassett’s reputation.”
3341,PART I,
3342,PART I,The smaller lights disappeared; the glare of the destroyers’ funnels
3343,PART I,dwindled even as we watched.
3344,PART I,
3345,PART I,"“They’re going down Channel with lights out, thus showin’ their zeal"
3346,PART I,"an’ drivin’ all watch-officers crazy. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think"
3347,PART I,"I’ll get you your pyjamas, an’ you’ll turn in,” said Pyecroft."
3348,PART I,
3349,PART I,"He piloted me to the steel tunnel, where the ham still swung"
3350,PART I,"majestically over the swaying table, and dragged out trousers and a"
3351,PART I,"coat with a monk’s hood, all hewn from one hairy inch-thick board."
3352,PART I,
3353,PART I,“If you fall over in these you’ll be drowned. They’re lammies. I’ll
3354,PART I,chock you off with a pillow; but sleepin’ in a torpedo-boat’s what you
3355,PART I,might call an acquired habit.”
3356,PART I,
3357,PART I,I coiled down on an iron-hard horse-hair pillow next the quivering
3358,PART I,"steel wall to acquire that habit. The sea, sliding over 267’s skin,"
3359,PART I,"worried me with importunate, half-caught confidences. It drummed"
3360,PART I,"tackily to gather my attention, coughed, spat, cleared its throat, and,"
3361,PART I,"on the eve of that portentous communication, retired up stage as a"
3362,PART I,"multitude whispering. Anon, I caught the tramp of armies afoot, the hum"
3363,PART I,"of crowded cities awaiting the event, the single sob of a woman, and"
3364,PART I,dry roaring of wild beasts. A dropped shovel clanging on the stokehold
3365,PART I,"floor was, naturally enough, the unbarring of arena gates; our sucking"
3366,PART I,"uplift across the crest of some little swell, nothing less than the"
3367,PART I,haling forth of new worlds; our half-turning descent into the hollow of
3368,PART I,"its mate, the abysmal plunge of God-forgotten planets. Through all"
3369,PART I,these phenomena and more—though I ran with wild horses over illimitable
3370,PART I,plains of rustling grass; though I crouched belly-flat under appalling
3371,PART I,"fires of musketry; though I was Livingstone, painless, and incurious in"
3372,PART I,"the grip of his lion—my shut eyes saw the lamp swinging in its gimbals,"
3373,PART I,"the irregularly gliding patch of light on the steel ladder, and every"
3374,PART I,elastic shadow in the corners of the frail angle-irons; while my body
3375,PART I,strove to accommodate itself to the infernal vibration of the machine.
3376,PART I,"At the last I rolled limply on the floor, and woke to real life with a"
3377,PART I,bruised nose and a great call to go on deck at once.
3378,PART I,
3379,PART I,"“It’s all right,” said a voice in my booming ears. “Morgan and Laughton"
3380,PART I,are worse than you!”
3381,PART I,
3382,PART I,I was gripping a rail. Mr. Pyecroft pointed with his foot to two
3383,PART I,"bundles beside a torpedo-tube, which at Weymouth had been a signaller"
3384,PART I,"and a most able seaman. “She’d do better in a bigger sea,” said Mr."
3385,PART I,Pyecroft. “This lop is what fetches it up.”
3386,PART I,
3387,PART I,"The sky behind us whitened as I laboured, and the first dawn drove down"
3388,PART I,"the Channel, tipping the wave-tops with a chill glare. To me that round"
3389,PART I,wind which runs before the true day has ever been fortunate and of good
3390,PART I,"omen. It cleared the trouble from my body, and set my soul dancing to"
3391,PART I,267’s heel and toe across the northerly set of the waves—such waves as
3392,PART I,I had often watched contemptuously from the deck of a ten-thousand-ton
3393,PART I,"liner. They shouldered our little hull sideways and passed, scalloped,"
3394,PART I,"and splayed out, toward the coast, carrying our white wake in loops"
3395,PART I,along their hollow backs. In succession we looked down a lead-grey
3396,PART I,"cutting of water for half a clear mile, were flung up on its ridge,"
3397,PART I,beheld the Channel traffic—full-sailed to that fair breeze—all about
3398,PART I,"us, and swung slantwise, light as a bladder, elastic as a basket, into"
3399,PART I,"the next furrow. Then the sun found us, struck the wet gray bows to"
3400,PART I,"living, leaping opal, the colourless deep to hard sapphire, the many"
3401,PART I,"sails to pearl, and the little steam-plume of our escape to an"
3402,PART I,inconstant rainbow.
3403,PART I,
3404,PART I,"“A fair day and a fair wind for all, thank God!” said Emanuel Pyecroft,"
3405,PART I,throwing back the cowl-like hood of his blanket coat. His face was
3406,PART I,"pitted with coal-dust and grime, pallid for lack of sleep; but his eyes"
3407,PART I,shone like a gull’s.
3408,PART I,
3409,PART I,“I told you you’d see life. Think o’ the _Pedantic_ now. Think o’ her
3410,PART I,Number One chasin’ the mobilised gobbies round the lower deck flats.
3411,PART I,"Think o’ the pore little snotties now bein’ washed, fed, and taught,"
3412,PART I,an’ the yeoman o’ signals with a pink eye wakin’ bright ’an brisk to
3413,PART I,another perishin’ day of five-flag hoists. Whereas _we_ shall caulk an’
3414,PART I,"smoke cigarettes, same as the Spanish destroyers did for three weeks"
3415,PART I,after war was declared.” He dropped into the wardroom singing:—
3416,PART I,
3417,PART I,"If you’re going to marry me, marry me, Bill,"
3418,PART I,It’s no use muckin’ about!
3419,PART I,
3420,PART I,
3421,PART I,"The man at the wheel, uniformed in what had once been a Tam-o’-shanter,"
3422,PART I,"a pair of very worn R.M.L.I. trousers rolled up to the knee, and a"
3423,PART I,"black sweater, was smoking a cigarette. Moorshed, in a gray Balaclava"
3424,PART I,"and a brown mackintosh with a flapping cape, hauled at our"
3425,PART I,"supplementary funnel guys, and a thing like a waiter from a Soho"
3426,PART I,restaurant sat at the head of the engine-room ladder exhorting the
3427,PART I,unseen below. The following wind beat down our smoke and covered all
3428,PART I,"things with an inch-thick layer of stokers, so that eyelids, teeth, and"
3429,PART I,feet gritted in their motions. I began to see that my previous
3430,PART I,experiences among battleships and cruisers had been altogether beside
3431,PART I,the mark.
3432,PART I,
3433,PART I,
3434,PART I,
3435,PART I,
3436,PART II,PART II
3437,PART II,
3438,PART II,The wind went down with the sunset—
3439,PART II,"The fog came up with the tide,"
3440,PART II,When the Witch of the North took an Egg-shell (_bis_)
3441,PART II,With a little Blue Devil inside.
3442,PART II,"“Sink,” she said, “or swim,” she said,"
3443,PART II,“It’s all you will get from me.
3444,PART II,"And that is the finish of him!” she said,"
3445,PART II,And the Egg-shell went to sea.
3446,PART II,
3447,PART II,"The wind got up with the morning,"
3448,PART II,"And the fog blew off with the rain,"
3449,PART II,When the Witch of the North saw the Egg-shell
3450,PART II,And the little Blue Devil again.
3451,PART II,"“Did you swim?” she said. “Did you sink?” she said,"
3452,PART II,And the little Blue Devil replied:
3453,PART II,"“For myself I swam, but I think,” he said,"
3454,PART II,“There’s somebody sinking outside.”
3455,PART II,
3456,PART II,
3457,PART II,"But for the small detail that I was a passenger and a civilian, and"
3458,PART II,"might not alter her course, torpedo-boat No. 267 was mine to me all"
3459,PART II,"that priceless day. Moorshed, after breakfast—frizzled ham and a devil"
3460,PART II,"that Pyecroft made out of sardines, anchovies, and French mustard"
3461,PART II,smashed together with a spanner—showed me his few and simple navigating
3462,PART II,"tools, and took an observation. Morgan, the signaller, let me hold the"
3463,PART II,chamois leathers while he cleaned the searchlight (we seemed to be
3464,PART II,"better equipped with electricity than most of our class), that lived"
3465,PART II,"under a bulbous umbrella-cover amidship. Then Pyecroft and Morgan,"
3466,PART II,"standing easy, talked together of the King’s Service as reformers and"
3467,PART II,"revolutionists, so notably, that were I not engaged on this tale I"
3468,PART II,"would, for its conclusion, substitute theirs."
3469,PART II,
3470,PART II,"I would speak of Hinchcliffe—Henry Salt Hinchcliffe, first-class"
3471,PART II,"engine-room artificer, and genius in his line, who was prouder of"
3472,PART II,having taken part in the Hat Crusade in his youth than of all his
3473,PART II,"daring, his skill, and his nickel-steel nerve. I consorted with him for"
3474,PART II,"an hour in the packed and dancing engine-room, when Moorshed suggested"
3475,PART II,"“whacking her up” to eighteen knots, to see if she would stand it. The"
3476,PART II,floor was ankle-deep in a creamy batter of oil and water; each moving
3477,PART II,"part flicking more oil in zoetrope-circles, and the gauges invisible"
3478,PART II,for their dizzy chattering on the chattering steel bulkhead. Leading
3479,PART II,"stoker Grant, said to be a bigamist, an ox-eyed man smothered in hair,"
3480,PART II,took me to the stokehold and planted me between a searing white furnace
3481,PART II,"and some hell-hot iron plate for fifteen minutes, while I listened to"
3482,PART II,"the drone of fans and the worry of the sea without, striving to wrench"
3483,PART II,all that palpitating firepot wide open.
3484,PART II,
3485,PART II,Then I came on deck and watched Moorshed—revolving in his orbit from
3486,PART II,"the canvas bustle and torpedo-tubes aft, by way of engine-room,"
3487,PART II,"conning-tower, and wheel, to the doll’s house of a foc’sle—learned in"
3488,PART II,"experience withheld from me, moved by laws beyond my knowledge,"
3489,PART II,"authoritative, entirely adequate, and yet, in heart, a child at his"
3490,PART II,play. _I_ could not take ten steps along the crowded deck but I
3491,PART II,"collided with some body or thing; but he and his satellites swung,"
3492,PART II,"passed, and returned on their vocations with the freedom and"
3493,PART II,spaciousness of the well-poised stars.
3494,PART II,
3495,PART II,"Even now I can at will recall every tone and gesture, with each"
3496,PART II,dissolving picture inboard or overside—Hinchcliffe’s white arm buried
3497,PART II,to the shoulder in a hornet’s nest of spinning machinery; Moorshed’s
3498,PART II,halt and jerk to windward as he looked across the water; Pyecroft’s
3499,PART II,"back bent over the Berthon collapsible boat, while he drilled three men"
3500,PART II,in expanding it swiftly; the outflung white water at the foot of a
3501,PART II,"homeward-bound Chinaman not a hundred yards away, and her"
3502,PART II,"shadow-slashed, rope-purfled sails bulging sideways like insolent"
3503,PART II,"cheeks; the ribbed and pitted coal-dust on our decks, all iridescent"
3504,PART II,under the sun; the first filmy haze that paled the shadows of our
3505,PART II,funnels about lunch time; the gradual die-down and dulling over of the
3506,PART II,"short, cheery seas; the sea that changed to a swell: the swell that"
3507,PART II,"crumbled up and ran allwhither oilily: the triumphant, almost audible"
3508,PART II,roll inward of wandering fog-walls that had been stalking us for two
3509,PART II,"hours, and—welt upon welt, chill as the grave—the drive of the"
3510,PART II,interminable main fog of the Atlantic. We slowed to little more than
3511,PART II,steerage-way and lay listening. Presently a hand-bellows foghorn jarred
3512,PART II,"like a corncrake, and there rattled out of the mist a big ship"
3513,PART II,literally above us. We could count the rivets in her plates as we
3514,PART II,"scrooped by, and the little drops of dew gathered below them."
3515,PART II,
3516,PART II,“Wonder why they’re always barks—always steel—always four-masted—an’
3517,PART II,"never less than two thousand tons. But they are,” said Pyecroft. He was"
3518,PART II,"out on the turtle-backed bows of her; Moorshed was at the wheel, and"
3519,PART II,another man worked the whistle.
3520,PART II,
3521,PART II,"“This fog is the best thing could ha’ happened to us,” said Moorshed."
3522,PART II,“It gives us our chance to run in on the quiet…. Hal-lo!”
3523,PART II,
3524,PART II,"A cracked bell rang. Clean and sharp (beautifully grained, too), a"
3525,PART II,"bowsprit surged over our starboard bow, the bobstay confidentially"
3526,PART II,hooking itself into our forward rail.
3527,PART II,
3528,PART II,I saw Pyecroft’s arm fly up; heard at the same moment the severing of
3529,PART II,"the tense rope, the working of the wheel, Moorshed’s voice down the"
3530,PART II,"tube saying, “Astern a little, please, Mr. Hinchcliffe!” and Pyecroft’s"
3531,PART II,"cry, “Trawler with her gear down! Look out for our propeller, Sir, or"
3532,PART II,we’ll be wrapped up in the rope.”
3533,PART II,
3534,PART II,"267 surged quickly under my feet, as the pressure of the"
3535,PART II,downward-bearing bobstay was removed. Half-a-dozen men of the foc’sle
3536,PART II,"had already thrown out fenders, and stood by to bear off a just visible"
3537,PART II,bulwark.
3538,PART II,
3539,PART II,"Still going astern, we touched slowly, broadside on, to a suggestive"
3540,PART II,"crunching of fenders, and I looked into the deck of a Brixham trawler,"
3541,PART II,her crew struck dumb.
3542,PART II,
3543,PART II,“Any luck?” said Moorshed politely.
3544,PART II,
3545,PART II,"“Not till we met yeou,” was the answer. “The Lard he saved us from they"
3546,PART II,big ships to be spitted by the little wan. Where be’e gwine tu with our
3547,PART II,fine new bobstay?”
3548,PART II,
3549,PART II,"“Yah! You’ve had time to splice it by now,” said Pyecroft with"
3550,PART II,contempt.
3551,PART II,
3552,PART II,“Aie; but we’m all crushed to port like aigs. You was runnin’
3553,PART II,"twenty-seven knots, us reckoned it. Didn’t us, Albert?”"
3554,PART II,
3555,PART II,"“Liker twenty-nine, an’ niver no whistle.”"
3556,PART II,
3557,PART II,"“Yes, we always do that. Do you want a tow to Brixham?” said Moorshed."
3558,PART II,
3559,PART II,A great silence fell upon those wet men of the sea.
3560,PART II,
3561,PART II,"We lifted a little toward their side, but our silent, quick-breathing"
3562,PART II,"crew, braced and strained outboard, bore us off as though we had been a"
3563,PART II,mere picket-boat.
3564,PART II,
3565,PART II,“What for?” said a puzzled voice.
3566,PART II,
3567,PART II,“For love; for nothing. You’ll be abed in Brixham by midnight.”
3568,PART II,
3569,PART II,“Yiss; but trawl’s down.”
3570,PART II,
3571,PART II,“No hurry. I’ll pass you a line and go ahead. Sing out when you’re
3572,PART II,ready.” A rope smacked on their deck with the word; they made it fast;
3573,PART II,"we slid forward, and in ten seconds saw nothing save a few feet of the"
3574,PART II,wire rope running into fog over our stern; but we heard the noise of
3575,PART II,debate.
3576,PART II,
3577,PART II,"“Catch a Brixham trawler letting go of a free tow in a fog,” said"
3578,PART II,Moorshed listening.
3579,PART II,
3580,PART II,“But what in the world do you want him for?” I asked.
3581,PART II,
3582,PART II,"“Oh, he’ll came in handy later.”"
3583,PART II,
3584,PART II,“Was that your first collision?”
3585,PART II,
3586,PART II,"“Yes.” I shook hands with him in silence, and our tow hailed us."
3587,PART II,
3588,PART II,“Aie! yeou little man-o’-war!” The voice rose muffled and wailing.
3589,PART II,"“After us’ve upped trawl, us’ll be glad of a tow. Leave line just slack"
3590,PART II,"abaout as ’tis now, and kip a good fine look-out be’ind ’ee.”"
3591,PART II,
3592,PART II,“There’s an accommodatin’ blighter for you!” said Pyecroft. “Where does
3593,PART II,"he expect we’ll be, with these currents evolutin’ like sailormen at the"
3594,PART II,Agricultural Hall?”
3595,PART II,
3596,PART II,I left the bridge to watch the wire-rope at the stern as it drew out
3597,PART II,and smacked down upon the water. By what instinct or guidance 267 kept
3598,PART II,"it from fouling her languidly flapping propeller, I cannot tell. The"
3599,PART II,fog now thickened and thinned in streaks that bothered the eyes like
3600,PART II,the glare of intermittent flash-lamps; by turns granting us the vision
3601,PART II,"of a sick sun that leered and fled, or burying all a thousand fathom"
3602,PART II,deep in gulfs of vapours. At no time could we see the trawler though we
3603,PART II,"heard the click of her windlass, the jar of her trawl-beam, and the"
3604,PART II,very flap of the fish on her deck. Forward was Pyecroft with the lead;
3605,PART II,"on the bridge Moorshed pawed a Channel chart; aft sat I, listening to"
3606,PART II,the whole of the British Mercantile Marine (never a keel less)
3607,PART II,"returning to England, and watching the fog-dew run round the bight of"
3608,PART II,the tow back to its mother-fog.
3609,PART II,
3610,PART II,“Aie! yeou little man-o’-war! We’m done with trawl. You can take us
3611,PART II,home if you know the road.”
3612,PART II,
3613,PART II,“Right O!” said Moorshed. “We’ll give the fishmonger a run for his
3614,PART II,"money. Whack her up, Mr. Hinchcliffe.”"
3615,PART II,
3616,PART II,The next few hours completed my education. I saw that I ought to be
3617,PART II,"afraid, but more clearly (this was when a liner hooted down the back of"
3618,PART II,my neck) that any fear which would begin to do justice to the situation
3619,PART II,"would, if yielded to, incapacitate me for the rest of my days. A shadow"
3620,PART II,"of spread sails, deeper than the darkening twilight, brooding over us"
3621,PART II,"like the wings of Azrael (Pyecroft said she was a Swede), and,"
3622,PART II,"miraculously withdrawn, persuaded me that there was a working chance"
3623,PART II,"that I should reach the beach—any beach—alive, if not dry; and (this"
3624,PART II,was when an economical tramp laved our port-rail with her condenser
3625,PART II,"water) were I so spared, I vowed I would tell my tale worthily."
3626,PART II,
3627,PART II,Thus we floated in space as souls drift through raw time. Night added
3628,PART II,"herself to the fog, and I laid hold on my limbs jealously, lest they,"
3629,PART II,"too, should melt in the general dissolution."
3630,PART II,
3631,PART II,"“Where’s that prevaricatin’ fishmonger?” said Pyecroft, turning a"
3632,PART II,lantern on a scant yard of the gleaming wire-rope that pointed like a
3633,PART II,stick to my left. “He’s doin’ some fancy steerin’ on his own. No wonder
3634,PART II,"Mr. Hincheliffe is blasphemious. The tow’s sheered off to starboard,"
3635,PART II,Sir. He’ll fair pull the stern out of us.”
3636,PART II,
3637,PART II,"Moorshed, invisible, cursed through the megaphone into invisibility."
3638,PART II,
3639,PART II,“Aie! yeou little man-o’-war!” The voice butted through the fog with
3640,PART II,the monotonous insistence of a strayed sheep’s. “We don’t all like the
3641,PART II,road you’m takin’. ’Tis no road to Brixham. You’ll be buckled up under
3642,PART II,Prawle Point by’mbye.”
3643,PART II,
3644,PART II,“Do you pretend to know where you are?” the megaphone roared.
3645,PART II,
3646,PART II,"“Iss, I reckon; but there’s no pretence to me!”"
3647,PART II,
3648,PART II,“O Peter!” said Pyecroft. “Let’s hang him at ’is own gaff.”
3649,PART II,
3650,PART II,"I could not see what followed, but Moorshed said: “Take another man"
3651,PART II,"with you. If you lose the tow, you’re done. I’ll slow her down.”"
3652,PART II,
3653,PART II,I heard the dinghy splash overboard ere I could cry “Murder!” Heard the
3654,PART II,"rasp of a boat-hook along the wire-rope, and then, as it had been in my"
3655,PART II,"ear, Pyecroft’s enormous and jubilant bellow astern: “Why, he’s here!"
3656,PART II,"Right atop of us! The blighter ’as pouched half the tow, like a shark!”"
3657,PART II,"A long pause filled with soft Devonian bleatings. Then Pyecroft, _solo"
3658,PART II,"arpeggio_: “Rum? Rum? Rum? Is that all? Come an’ try it, uncle.”"
3659,PART II,
3660,PART II,"I lifted my face to where once God’s sky had been, and besought The"
3661,PART II,"Trues I might not die inarticulate, amid these half-worked miracles,"
3662,PART II,but live at least till my fellow-mortals could be made one-millionth as
3663,PART II,"happy as I was happy. I prayed and I waited, and we went slow—slow as"
3664,PART II,the processes of evolution—till the boat-hook rasped again.
3665,PART II,
3666,PART II,"“He’s not what you might call a scientific navigator,” said Pyecroft,"
3667,PART II,"still in the dinghy, but rising like a fairy from a pantomime trap."
3668,PART II,“The lead’s what ’e goes by mostly; rum is what he’s come for; an’
3669,PART II,"Brixham is ’is ’ome. Lay on, Mucduff!”"
3670,PART II,
3671,PART II,"A white whiskered man in a frock-coat—as I live by bread, a"
3672,PART II,"frock-coat!—sea-boots, and a comforter crawled over the torpedo-tube"
3673,PART II,into Moorshed’s grip and vanished forward.
3674,PART II,
3675,PART II,“’E’ll probably ’old three gallon (look sharp with that dinghy!); but
3676,PART II,"’is nephew, left in charge of the _Agatha_, wants two bottles"
3677,PART II,"command-allowance. You’re a tax-payer, Sir. Do you think that"
3678,PART II,excessive?”
3679,PART II,
3680,PART II,“Lead there! Lead!” rang out from forward.
3681,PART II,
3682,PART II,“Didn’t I say ’e wouldn’t understand compass deviations? Watch him
3683,PART II,close. It’ll be worth it!”
3684,PART II,
3685,PART II,As I neared the bridge I heard the stranger say: “Let me zmell un!” and
3686,PART II,to his nose was the lead presented by a trained man of the King’s Navy.
3687,PART II,
3688,PART II,"“I’ll tell ’ee where to goo, if yeou’ll tell your donkey-man what to"
3689,PART II,"du. I’m no hand wi’ steam.” On these lines we proceeded miraculously,"
3690,PART II,"and, under Moorshed’s orders—I was the fisherman’s Ganymede, even as"
3691,PART II,“M. de C.” had served the captain—I found both rum and curaçoa in a
3692,PART II,"locker, and mixed them equal bulk in an enamelled iron cup."
3693,PART II,
3694,PART II,"“Now we’m just abeam o’ where we should be,” he said at last, “an’ here"
3695,PART II,we’ll lay till she lifts. I’d take ’e in for another bottle—and wan for
3696,PART II,my nevvy; but I reckon yeou’m shart-allowanced for rum. That’s nivver
3697,PART II,no Navy rum yeou’m give me. Knowed ’ee by the smack tu un. Anchor now!”
3698,PART II,
3699,PART II,"I was between Pyecroft and Moorshed on the bridge, and heard them"
3700,PART II,spring to vibrating attention at my side. A man with a lead a few feet
3701,PART II,"to port caught the panic through my body, and checked like a wild boar"
3702,PART II,"at gaze, for not far away an unmistakable ship’s bell was ringing. It"
3703,PART II,"ceased, and another began."
3704,PART II,
3705,PART II,“Them!” said Pyecroft. “Anchored!”
3706,PART II,
3707,PART II,"“More!” said our pilot, passing me the cup, and I filled it. The"
3708,PART II,trawler astern clattered vehemently on her bell. Pyecroft with a jerk
3709,PART II,of his arm threw loose the forward three-pounder. The bar of the
3710,PART II,back-sight was heavily blobbed with dew; the foresight was invisible.
3711,PART II,
3712,PART II,"“No—they wouldn’t have their picket-boats out in this weather, though"
3713,PART II,they ought to.” He returned the barrel to its crotch slowly.
3714,PART II,
3715,PART II,"“Be yeou gwine to anchor?” said Macduff, smacking his lips, “or be yeou"
3716,PART II,gwine straight on to Livermead Beach?”
3717,PART II,
3718,PART II,"“Tell him what we’re driving at. Get it into his head somehow,” said"
3719,PART II,"Moorshed; and Pyecroft, snatching the cup from me, enfolded the old man"
3720,PART II,with an arm and a mist of wonderful words.
3721,PART II,
3722,PART II,"“And if you pull it off,” said Moorshed at the last, “I’ll give you a"
3723,PART II,fiver.”
3724,PART II,
3725,PART II,"“Lard! What’s fivers to me, young man? My nevvy, he likes ’em; but I do"
3726,PART II,cherish more on fine drink than filthy lucre any day o’ God’s good
3727,PART II,"weeks. Leave goo my arm, yeou common sailorman! I tall ’ee, gentlemen,"
3728,PART II,"I hain’t the ram-faced, ruddle-nosed old fule yeou reckon I be. Before"
3729,PART II,the mast I’ve fared in my time; fisherman I’ve been since I seed the
3730,PART II,"unsense of sea-dangerin’. Baccy and spirits—yiss, an’ cigars too, I’ve"
3731,PART II,run a plenty. I’m no blind harse or boy to be coaxed with your
3732,PART II,forty-mile free towin’ and rum atop of all. There’s none more sober to
3733,PART II,"Brix’am this tide, I don’t care who ’tis—than me. _I_ know—_I_ know."
3734,PART II,"Yander’m two great King’s ships. Yeou’m wishful to sink, burn, and"
3735,PART II,destroy they while us kips ’em busy sellin’ fish. No need tall me so
3736,PART II,"twanty taime over. Us’ll find they ships! Us’ll find ’em, if us has to"
3737,PART II,break our fine new bowsprit so close as Crump’s bull’s horn!”
3738,PART II,
3739,PART II,"“Good egg!” quoth Moorshed, and brought his hand down on the wide"
3740,PART II,shoulders with the smack of a beaver’s tail.
3741,PART II,
3742,PART II,“Us’ll go look for they by hand. Us’ll give they something to play
3743,PART II,"upon; an’ do ’ee deal with them faithfully, an’ may the Lard have mercy"
3744,PART II,on your sowls! Amen. Put I in dinghy again.”
3745,PART II,
3746,PART II,The fog was as dense as ever—we moved in the very womb of night—but I
3747,PART II,"cannot recall that I took the faintest note of it as the dinghy, guided"
3748,PART II,"by the tow-rope, disappeared toward the _Agatha_, Pyecroft rowing. The"
3749,PART II,bell began again on the starboard bow.
3750,PART II,
3751,PART II,"“We’re pretty near,” said Moorshed, slowing down. “Out with the"
3752,PART II,"Berthon. (_We’ll_ sell ’em fish, too.) And if any one rows Navy-stroke,"
3753,PART II,I’ll break his jaw with the tiller. Mr. Hinchcliffe (this down the
3754,PART II,"tube), “you’ll stay here in charge with Gregory and Shergold and the"
3755,PART II,"engine-room staff. Morgan stays, too, for signalling purposes.” A deep"
3756,PART II,"groan broke from Morgan’s chest, but he said nothing. “If the fog thins"
3757,PART II,"and you’re seen by any one, keep’em quiet with the signals. I can’t"
3758,PART II,"think of the precise lie just now, but _you_ can, Morgan.”"
3759,PART II,
3760,PART II,"“Yes, Sir.”"
3761,PART II,
3762,PART II,"“Suppose their torpedo-nets are down?” I whispered, shivering with"
3763,PART II,excitement.
3764,PART II,
3765,PART II,"“If they’ve been repairing minor defects all day, they won’t have any"
3766,PART II,"one to spare from the engine-room, and ‘Out nets!’ is a job for the"
3767,PART II,whole ship’s company. I expect they’ve trusted to the fog—like us.
3768,PART II,"Well, Pyecroft?”"
3769,PART II,
3770,PART II,That great soul had blown up on to the bridge like a feather. “’Ad to
3771,PART II,"see the first o’ the rum into the _Agathites_, Sir. They was a bit"
3772,PART II,"jealous o’ their commandin’ officer comin’ ’ome so richly lacquered,"
3773,PART II,"and at first the _conversazione_ languished, as you might say. But they"
3774,PART II,"sprang to attention ere I left. Six sharp strokes on the bells, if any"
3775,PART II,"of ’em are sober enough to keep tally, will be the signal that our"
3776,PART II,consort ’as cast off her tow an’ is manceuvrin’ on ’er own.”
3777,PART II,
3778,PART II,“Right O! Take Laughton with you in the dinghy. Put that Berthon over
3779,PART II,"quietly there! Are you all right, Mr. Hinchcliffe?”"
3780,PART II,
3781,PART II,I stood back to avoid the rush of half-a-dozen shadows dropping into
3782,PART II,"the Berthon boat. A hand caught me by the slack of my garments, moved"
3783,PART II,"me in generous arcs through the night, and I rested on the bottom of"
3784,PART II,the dinghy.
3785,PART II,
3786,PART II,"“I want you for _prima facie_ evidence, in case the vaccination don’t"
3787,PART II,"take,” said Pyecroft in my ear. “Push off, Alf!”"
3788,PART II,
3789,PART II,The last bell-ringing was high overhead. It was followed by six little
3790,PART II,"tinkles from the _Agatha_, the roar of her falling anchor, the clash of"
3791,PART II,"pans, and loose shouting."
3792,PART II,
3793,PART II,“Where be gwine tu? Port your ’ellum. Aie! you mud-dredger in the
3794,PART II,"fairway, goo astern! Out boats! She’ll sink us!”"
3795,PART II,
3796,PART II,A clear-cut Navy voice drawled from the clouds: “Quiet! you gardeners
3797,PART II,there. This is the _Cryptic_ at anchor.”
3798,PART II,
3799,PART II,"“Thank you for the range,” said Pyecroft, and paddled gingerly. “Feel"
3800,PART II,"well out in front of you, Alf. Remember your fat fist is our only"
3801,PART II,Marconi installation.” The voices resumed:
3802,PART II,
3803,PART II,“Bournemouth steamer he says she be.”
3804,PART II,
3805,PART II,“Then where be Brixham Harbor?”
3806,PART II,
3807,PART II,"“Damme, I’m a tax-payer tu. They’ve no right to cruise about this way."
3808,PART II,I’ll have the laa on ’ee if anything carries away.”
3809,PART II,
3810,PART II,Then the man-of-war:
3811,PART II,
3812,PART II,"“Short on your anchor! Heave short, you howling maniacs! You’ll get"
3813,PART II,yourselves smashed in a minute if you drift.”
3814,PART II,
3815,PART II,"The air was full of these and other voices as the dinghy, checking,"
3816,PART II,swung. I passed one hand down Laughton’s stretched arm and felt an iron
3817,PART II,gooseneck and a foot or two of a backward-sloping torpedo-net boom. The
3818,PART II,"other hand I laid on broad, cold iron—even the flanks of H.M.S."
3819,PART II,"_Cryptic_, which is twelve thousand tons."
3820,PART II,
3821,PART II,"I heard a scrubby, raspy sound, as though Pyecroft had chosen that hour"
3822,PART II,"to shave, and I smelled paint. “Drop aft a bit, Alf; we’ll put a"
3823,PART II,stencil under the stern six-inch casements.”
3824,PART II,
3825,PART II,Boom by boom Laughlin slid the dinghy along the towering curved wall.
3826,PART II,"Once, twice, and again we stopped, and the keen scrubbing sound was"
3827,PART II,renewed.
3828,PART II,
3829,PART II,"“Umpires are ’ard-’earted blighters, but this ought to convince ’em…."
3830,PART II,Captain Panke’s stern-walk is now above our defenceless ’eads. Repeat
3831,PART II,"the evolution up the starboard side, Alf.”"
3832,PART II,
3833,PART II,I was only conscious that we moved around an iron world palpitating
3834,PART II,"with life. Though my knowledge was all by touch—as, for example, when"
3835,PART II,"Pyecroft led my surrendered hand to the base of some bulging sponson,"
3836,PART II,or when my palm closed on the knife-edge of the stem and patted it
3837,PART II,"timidly—yet I felt lonely and unprotected as the enormous, helpless"
3838,PART II,"ship was withdrawn, and we drifted away into the void where voices"
3839,PART II,sang:
3840,PART II,
3841,PART II,"Tom Pearce, Tom Pearce, lend me thy gray mare,"
3842,PART II,"All along, out along, down along lea!"
3843,PART II,I want for to go to Widdicombe Fair
3844,PART II,"With Bill Brewer, Sam Sewer, Peter Gurney, Harry Hawke,"
3845,PART II,Old Uncle Tom Cobley an’ all!
3846,PART II,
3847,PART II,
3848,PART II,"“That’s old Sinbad an’ ’is little lot from the _Agatha_! Give way, Alf!"
3849,PART II,"_You_ might sing somethin’, too.”"
3850,PART II,
3851,PART II,"“I’m no burnin’ Patti. Ain’t there noise enough for you, Pye?”"
3852,PART II,
3853,PART II,"“Yes, but it’s only amateurs. Give me the tones of ’earth and ’ome. Ha!"
3854,PART II,"List to the blighter on the ’orizon sayin’ his prayers, Navy-fashion."
3855,PART II,’Eaven ’elp me argue that way when I’m a warrant-officer!”
3856,PART II,
3857,PART II,We headed with little lapping strokes toward what seemed to be a
3858,PART II,fair-sized riot.
3859,PART II,
3860,PART II,"“An’ I’ve ’eard the _Devolution_ called a happy ship, too,” said"
3861,PART II,Pyecroft. “Just shows ’ow a man’s misled by prejudice. She’s
3862,PART II,peevish—that’s what she is—nasty-peevish. Prob’ly all because the
3863,PART II,"_Agathites_ are scratching ’er paint. Well, rub along, Alf. I’ve got"
3864,PART II,the lymph!”
3865,PART II,
3866,PART II,"A voice, which Mr. Pyecroft assured me belonged to a chief carpenter,"
3867,PART II,was speaking through an aperture (starboard bow twelve-pounder on the
3868,PART II,"lower deck). He did not wish to purchase any fish, even at grossly"
3869,PART II,reduced rates. Nobody wished to buy any fish. This ship was the
3870,PART II,"_Devolution_ at anchor, and desired no communication with shore boats."
3871,PART II,
3872,PART II,"“Mark how the Navy ’olds it’s own. He’s sober. The _Agathites_ are not,"
3873,PART II,"as you might say, an’ yet they can’t live with ’im. It’s the discipline"
3874,PART II,that does it. ’Ark to the bald an’ unconvincin’ watch-officer chimin’
3875,PART II,in. I wonder where Mr. Moorshed has got to?”
3876,PART II,
3877,PART II,"We drifted down the _Devolution’s_ side, as we had drifted down her"
3878,PART II,sister’s; and we dealt with her in that dense gloom as we had dealt
3879,PART II,with her sister.
3880,PART II,
3881,PART II,"“Whai! ’Tis a man-o’-war, after all! I can see the captain’s whisker"
3882,PART II,all gilt at the edges! We took ’ee for the Bournemouth steamer. Three
3883,PART II,cheers for the real man-o’-war!”
3884,PART II,
3885,PART II,That cry came from under the _Devolution’s_ stern. Pyecroft held
3886,PART II,"something in his teeth, for I heard him mumble, “Our Mister Moorshed!”"
3887,PART II,
3888,PART II,"Said a boy’s voice above us, just as we dodged a jet of hot water from"
3889,PART II,some valve: “I don’t half like that cheer. If I’d been the old man I’d
3890,PART II,ha’ turned loose the quick-firers at the first go-off. Aren’t they
3891,PART II,"rowing Navy-stroke, yonder?”"
3892,PART II,
3893,PART II,"“True,” said Pyecroft, listening to retreating oars. “It’s time to go"
3894,PART II,"’ome when snotties begin to think. The fog’s thinnin’, too.”"
3895,PART II,
3896,PART II,"I felt a chill breath on my forehead, and saw a few feet of the steel"
3897,PART II,"stand out darker than the darkness, disappear—it was then the dinghy"
3898,PART II,shot away from it—and emerge once more.
3899,PART II,
3900,PART II,“Hallo! what boat’s that?” said the voice suspiciously.
3901,PART II,
3902,PART II,"“Why, I do believe it’s a real man-o’-war, after all,” said Pyecroft,"
3903,PART II,and kicked Laughton.
3904,PART II,
3905,PART II,“What’s that for?” Laughton was no dramatist.
3906,PART II,
3907,PART II,"“Answer in character, you blighter! Say somethin’ opposite.”"
3908,PART II,
3909,PART II,“What boat’s _thatt_?” The hail was repeated.
3910,PART II,
3911,PART II,"“What do yee say-ay?” Pyecroft bellowed, and, under his breath to me:"
3912,PART II,“Give us a hand.”
3913,PART II,
3914,PART II,"“It’s called the _Marietta_—F. J. Stokes—Torquay,” I began,"
3915,PART II,"quaveringly. “At least, that’s the name on the name-board. I’ve been"
3916,PART II,dining—on a yacht.”
3917,PART II,
3918,PART II,"“I see.” The voice shook a little, and my way opened before me with"
3919,PART II,disgraceful ease.
3920,PART II,
3921,PART II,“Yesh. Dining private yacht. _Eshmesheralda_. I belong to Torquay Yacht
3922,PART II,Club. _Are_ you member Torquay Yacht Club?”
3923,PART II,
3924,PART II,"“You’d better go to bed, Sir. Good-night.” We slid into the rapidly"
3925,PART II,thinning fog.
3926,PART II,
3927,PART II,"“Dig out, Alf. Put your _nix mangiare_ back into it. The fog’s peelin’"
3928,PART II,off like a petticoat. Where’s Two Six Seven?”
3929,PART II,
3930,PART II,"“I can’t see her,” I replied, “but there’s a light low down ahead.”"
3931,PART II,
3932,PART II,“The _Agatha_!” They rowed desperately through the uneasy dispersal of
3933,PART II,the fog for ten minutes and ducked round the trawler’s bow.
3934,PART II,
3935,PART II,"“Well, Emanuel means ‘God with us’—so far.” Pyecroft wiped his brow,"
3936,PART II,"laid a hand on the low rail, and as he boosted me up to the trawler, I"
3937,PART II,"saw Moorshed’s face, white as pearl in the thinning dark."
3938,PART II,
3939,PART II,"“Was it all right?” said he, over the bulwarks."
3940,PART II,
3941,PART II,"“Vaccination ain’t in it. She’s took beautiful. But where’s 267, Sir?”"
3942,PART II,Pyecroft replied.
3943,PART II,
3944,PART II,“Gone. We came here as the fog lifted. I gave the _Devolution_ four.
3945,PART II,Was that you behind us?”
3946,PART II,
3947,PART II,"“Yes, sir; but I only got in three on the _Devolution_. I gave the"
3948,PART II,"_Cryptic_ nine, though. They’re what you might call more or less"
3949,PART II,vaccinated.”
3950,PART II,
3951,PART II,"He lifted me inboard, where Moorshed and six pirates lay round the"
3952,PART II,_Agatha’s_ hatch. There was a hint of daylight in the cool air.
3953,PART II,
3954,PART II,“Where is the old man?” I asked.
3955,PART II,
3956,PART II,"“Still selling ’em fish, I suppose. He’s a darling! But I wish I could"
3957,PART II,get this filthy paint off my hands. Hallo! What the deuce is the
3958,PART II,_Cryptic_ signalling?”
3959,PART II,
3960,PART II,A pale masthead light winked through the last of the fog. It was
3961,PART II,answered by a white pencil to the southward.
3962,PART II,
3963,PART II,“Destroyer signalling with searchlight.” Pyecroft leaped on the
3964,PART II,stern-rail. “The first part is private signals. Ah! now she’s Morsing
3965,PART II,"against the fog. ‘P-O-S-T—yes, ‘postpone’—‘D-E-P- (go on)!"
3966,PART II,departure—till—further—orders—which—will—be com (he’s dropped the other
3967,PART II,"m) unicated—verbally. End,’. He swung round. “_Cryptic_ is now"
3968,PART II,answering: ‘Ready—proceed—immediately.
3969,PART II,What—news—promised—destroyer—flotilla?’”
3970,PART II,
3971,PART II,"“Hallo!” said Moorshed. “Well, never mind, They’ll come too late.”"
3972,PART II,
3973,PART II,“Whew! That’s some ’igh-born suckling on the destroyer. Destroyer
3974,PART II,signals: ‘Care not. All will be known later.’ What merry beehive’s
3975,PART II,broken loose now?”
3976,PART II,
3977,PART II,“What odds! We’ve done our little job.”
3978,PART II,
3979,PART II,“Why—why—it’s Two Six Seven!”
3980,PART II,
3981,PART II,Here Pyecroft dropped from the rail among the fishy nets and shook the
3982,PART II,"_Agatha_ with heavings. Moorshed cast aside his cigarette, looked over"
3983,PART II,"the stern, and fell into his subordinate’s arms. I heard the guggle of"
3984,PART II,"engines, the rattle of a little anchor going over not a hundred yards"
3985,PART II,"away, a cough, and Morgan’s subdued hail. … So far as I remember, it"
3986,PART II,was Laughton whom I hugged; but the men who hugged me most were
3987,PART II,"Pyecroft and Moorshed, adrift among the fishy nets."
3988,PART II,
3989,PART II,There was no semblance of discipline in our flight over the _Agatha’s_
3990,PART II,"side, nor, indeed, were ordinary precautions taken for the common"
3991,PART II,"safety, because (I was in the Berthon) they held that patent boat open"
3992,PART II,"by hand for the most part. We regained our own craft, cackling like"
3993,PART II,"wild geese, and crowded round Moorshed and Hinchcliffe. Behind us the"
3994,PART II,"_Agatha’s_ boat, returning from her fish-selling cruise, yelled: “Have"
3995,PART II,’ee done the trick? Have ’ee done the trick?” and we could only shout
3996,PART II,"hoarsely over the stern, guaranteeing them rum by the hold-full."
3997,PART II,
3998,PART II,"“Fog got patchy here at 12:27,” said Henry Salt Hinchcliffe, growing"
3999,PART II,clearer every instant in the dawn. “Went down to Brixham Harbour to
4000,PART II,keep out of the road. Heard whistles to the south and went to look. I
4001,PART II,had her up to sixteen good. Morgan kept on shedding private Red Fleet
4002,PART II,"signals out of the signal-book, as the fog cleared, till we was"
4003,PART II,answered by three destroyers. Morgan signalled ’em by searchlight:
4004,PART II,"‘Alter course to South Seventeen East, so as not to lose time.’ They"
4005,PART II,came round quick. We kept well away—on their port beam—and Morgan gave
4006,PART II,’em their orders.” He looked at Morgan and coughed.
4007,PART II,
4008,PART II,"“The signalman, acting as second in command,” said Morgan, swelling,"
4009,PART II,“then informed destroyer flotilla that _Cryptic_ and _Devolution_ had
4010,PART II,"made good defects, and, in obedience to Admiral’s supplementary orders"
4011,PART II,"(I was afraid they might suspect that, but they didn’t), had proceeded"
4012,PART II,"at seven knots at 11:23 P.M. to rendezvous near Channel Islands, seven"
4013,PART II,"miles N.N.W. the Casquet light. (I’ve rendezvoused there myself, Sir.)"
4014,PART II,Destroyer flotilla would therefore follow cruisers and catch up with
4015,PART II,them on their course. Destroyer flotilla then dug out on course
4016,PART II,"indicated, all funnels sparking briskly.”"
4017,PART II,
4018,PART II,“Who were the destroyers?”
4019,PART II,
4020,PART II,"“_Wraith, Kobbold, Stiletto_, Lieutenant-Commander A. L. Hignett,"
4021,PART II,acting under Admiral’s orders to escort cruisers received off the
4022,PART II,Dodman at 7 P.M. They’d come slow on account of fog.”
4023,PART II,
4024,PART II,“Then who were you?”
4025,PART II,
4026,PART II,"“We were the _Afrite_, port-engine broke down, put in to Torbay, and"
4027,PART II,"there instructed by _Cryptic_, previous to her departure with"
4028,PART II,_Devolution_) to inform Commander Hignett of change of plans.
4029,PART II,Lieutenant-Commander Hignett signalled that our meeting was quite
4030,PART II,"providential. After this we returned to pick up our commanding officer,"
4031,PART II,"and being interrogated by _Cryptic_, marked time signalling as"
4032,PART II,"requisite, which you may have seen. The _Agatha_ representing the last"
4033,PART II,"known rallying-point—or, as I should say, pivot-ship of the"
4034,PART II,evolution—it was decided to repair to the _Agatha_ at conclusion of
4035,PART II,manœuvre.”
4036,PART II,
4037,PART II,"We breathed deeply, all of us, but no one spoke a word till Moorshed"
4038,PART II,said: “Is there such a thing as one fine big drink aboard this one fine
4039,PART II,big battleship?”
4040,PART II,
4041,PART II,"“Can do, sir,” said Pyecroft, and got it. Beginning with Mr. Moorshed"
4042,PART II,"and ending with myself, junior to the third first-class stoker, we"
4043,PART II,"drank, and it was as water of the brook, that two and a half inches of"
4044,PART II,"stiff, treacly, Navy rum. And we looked each in the other’s face, and"
4045,PART II,"we nodded, bright-eyed, burning with bliss."
4046,PART II,
4047,PART II,"Moorshed walked aft to the torpedo-tubes and paced back and forth, a"
4048,PART II,captain victorious on his own quarterdeck; and the triumphant day broke
4049,PART II,over the green-bedded villas of Torquay to show us the magnitude of our
4050,PART II,victory. There lay the cruisers (I have reason to believe that they had
4051,PART II,made good their defects). They were each four hundred and forty feet
4052,PART II,"long and sixty-six wide; they held close upon eight hundred men apiece,"
4053,PART II,"and they had cost, say, a million and a half the pair. And they were"
4054,PART II,"ours, and they did not know it. Indeed, the _Cryptic_, senior ship, was"
4055,PART II,"signalling vehement remarks to our address, which we did not notice."
4056,PART II,
4057,PART II,"“If you take these glasses, you’ll get the general run o’ last night’s"
4058,PART II,"vaccination,” said Pyecroft. “Each one represents a torpedo got ’ome,"
4059,PART II,as you might say.”
4060,PART II,
4061,PART II,"I saw on the _Cryptic’s_ port side, as she lay half a mile away across"
4062,PART II,"the glassy water, four neat white squares in outline, a white blur in"
4063,PART II,the centre.
4064,PART II,
4065,PART II,“There are five more to starboard. ’Ere’s the original!” He handed me a
4066,PART II,"paint-dappled copper stencil-plate, two feet square, bearing in the"
4067,PART II,"centre the six-inch initials, “G.M.”"
4068,PART II,
4069,PART II,"“Ten minutes ago I’d ha’ eulogised about that little trick of ours, but"
4070,PART II,"Morgan’s performance has short-circuited me. Are you happy, Morgan?”"
4071,PART II,
4072,PART II,"“Bustin’,” said the signalman briefly."
4073,PART II,
4074,PART II,"“You may be. Gawd forgive you, Morgan, for as Queen ’Enrietta said to"
4075,PART II,"the ’ousemaid, _I_ never will. I’d ha’ given a year’s pay for ten"
4076,PART II,minutes o’ your signallin’ work this mornin’.”
4077,PART II,
4078,PART II,"“I wouldn’t ’ave took it up,” was the answer. “Perishin’ ’Eavens above!"
4079,PART II,Look at the _Devolution’s_ semaphore!” Two black wooden arms waved from
4080,PART II,the junior ship’s upper bridge. “They’ve seen it.”
4081,PART II,
4082,PART II,"“_The_ mote _on_ their neighbour’s beam, of course,” said Pyecroft, and"
4083,PART II,read syllable by syllable: “‘Captain Malan to Captain Panke.
4084,PART II,"Is—sten—cilled frieze your starboard side new Admiralty regulation, or"
4085,PART II,"your Number One’s private expense?’ Now _Cryptic_ is saying, ‘Not"
4086,PART II,"understood.’ Poor old _Crippy_, the _Devolute’s_ raggin’ ’er sore. ‘Who"
4087,PART II,is G.M.?’ she says. That’s fetched the _Cryptic_. She’s answerin’: ‘You
4088,PART II,"ought to know. Examine own paintwork.’ Oh, Lord! they’re both on to it"
4089,PART II,"now. This is balm. This is beginning to be balm. I forgive you,"
4090,PART II,Morgan!”
4091,PART II,
4092,PART II,Two frantic pipes twittered. From either cruiser a whaler dropped into
4093,PART II,the water and madly rowed round the ship: as a gay-coloured hoist rose
4094,PART II,to the _Cryptic’s_ yardarm: “Destroyer will close at once. Wish to
4095,PART II,speak by semaphore.” Then on the bridge semaphore itself: “Have been
4096,PART II,trying to attract your attention last half hour. Send commanding
4097,PART II,officer aboard at once.”
4098,PART II,
4099,PART II,"“Our attention? After all the attention we’ve given ’er, too,” said"
4100,PART II,Pyecroft. “What a greedy old woman!” To Moorshed: “Signal from the
4101,PART II,"_Cryptic_, Sir.”"
4102,PART II,
4103,PART II,"“Never mind that!” said the boy, peering through his glasses. “Our"
4104,PART II,"dinghy quick, or they’ll paint our marks out. Come along!”"
4105,PART II,
4106,PART II,By this time I was long past even hysteria. I remember Pyecroft’s
4107,PART II,"bending back, the surge of the driven dinghy, a knot of amazed faces as"
4108,PART II,"we skimmed the _Cryptic’s_ ram, and the dropped jaw of the midshipman"
4109,PART II,in her whaler when we barged fairly into him.
4110,PART II,
4111,PART II,“Mind my paint!” he yelled.
4112,PART II,
4113,PART II,"“You mind mine, snotty,” said Moorshed. “I was all night putting these"
4114,PART II,little ear-marks on you for the umpires to sit on. Leave ’em alone.”
4115,PART II,
4116,PART II,"We splashed past him to the _Devolution’s_ boat, where sat no one less"
4117,PART II,"than her first lieutenant, a singularly unhandy-looking officer."
4118,PART II,
4119,PART II,"“What the deuce is the meaning of this?” he roared, with an accusing"
4120,PART II,forefinger.
4121,PART II,
4122,PART II,"“You’re sunk, that’s all. You’ve been dead half a tide.”"
4123,PART II,
4124,PART II,"“Dead, am I? I’ll show you whether I’m dead or not, Sir!”"
4125,PART II,
4126,PART II,"“Well, you may be a survivor,” said Moorshed ingratiatingly, “though it"
4127,PART II,isn’t at all likely.”
4128,PART II,
4129,PART II,The officer choked for a minute. The midshipman crouched up in stern
4130,PART II,"said, half aloud: “Then I _was_ right—last night.”"
4131,PART II,
4132,PART II,"“Yesh,” I gasped from the dinghy’s coal-dust. “Are you member Torquay"
4133,PART II,Yacht Club?”
4134,PART II,
4135,PART II,"“Hell!” said the first lieutenant, and fled away. The _Cryptic’s_ boat"
4136,PART II,"was already at that cruiser’s side, and semaphores flicked zealously"
4137,PART II,"from ship to ship. We floated, a minute speck, between the two hulls,"
4138,PART II,while the pipes went for the captain’s galley on the _Devolution_.
4139,PART II,
4140,PART II,"“That’s all right,” said Moorshed. “Wait till the gangway’s down and"
4141,PART II,then board her decently. We oughtn’t to be expected to climb up a ship
4142,PART II,we’ve sunk.”
4143,PART II,
4144,PART II,"Pyecroft lay on his disreputable oars till Captain Malan,"
4145,PART II,"full-uniformed, descended the _Devolution’s_ side. With due"
4146,PART II,"compliments—not acknowledged, I grieve to say—we fell in behind his"
4147,PART II,"sumptuous galley, and at last, upon pressing invitation, climbed, black"
4148,PART II,"as sweeps all, the lowered gangway of the _Cryptic_. At the top stood"
4149,PART II,as fine a constellation of marine stars as ever sang together of a
4150,PART II,morning on a King’s ship. Every one who could get within earshot found
4151,PART II,that his work took him aft. I counted eleven able seamen polishing the
4152,PART II,"breechblock of the stern nine-point-two, four marines zealously"
4153,PART II,"relieving each other at the life-buoy, six call-boys, nine midshipmen"
4154,PART II,"of the watch, exclusive of naval cadets, and the higher ranks past all"
4155,PART II,census.
4156,PART II,
4157,PART II,"“If I die o’ joy,” said Pyecroft behind his hand, “remember I died"
4158,PART II,"forgivin’ Morgan from the bottom of my ’eart, because, like Martha, we"
4159,PART II,"’ave scoffed the better part. You’d better try to come to attention,"
4160,PART II,Sir.”
4161,PART II,
4162,PART II,"Moorshed ran his eye voluptuously over the upper deck battery, the huge"
4163,PART II,"beam, and the immaculate perspective of power. Captain Panke and"
4164,PART II,Captain Malan stood on the well-browned flash-plates by the dazzling
4165,PART II,"hatch. Precisely over the flagstaff I saw Two Six Seven astern, her"
4166,PART II,"black petticoat half hitched up, meekly floating on the still sea. She"
4167,PART II,"looked like the pious Abigail who has just spoken her mind, and, with"
4168,PART II,"folded hands, sits thanking Heaven among the pieces. I could almost"
4169,PART II,have sworn that she wore black worsted gloves and had a little dry
4170,PART II,cough. But it was Captain Panke that coughed so austerely. He favoured
4171,PART II,"us with a lecture on uniform, deportment, and the urgent necessity of"
4172,PART II,answering signals from a senior ship. He told us that he disapproved of
4173,PART II,"masquerading, that he loved discipline, and would be obliged by an"
4174,PART II,explanation. And while he delivered himself deeper and more deeply into
4175,PART II,"our hands, I saw Captain Malan wince. He was watching Moorshed’s eye."
4176,PART II,
4177,PART II,"“I belong to Blue Fleet, Sir. I command Number Two Six Seven,” said"
4178,PART II,"Moorshed, and Captain Planke was dumb. “Have you such a thing as a"
4179,PART II,frame-plan of the _Cryptic_ aboard?” He spoke with winning politeness
4180,PART II,as he opened a small and neatly folded paper.
4181,PART II,
4182,PART II,"“I have, sir.” The little man’s face was working with passion."
4183,PART II,
4184,PART II,“Ah! Then I shall be able to show you precisely where you were
4185,PART II,torpedoed last night in”—he consulted the paper with one finely arched
4186,PART II,"eyebrow—“in nine places. And since the _Devolution_ is, I understand, a"
4187,PART II,sister ship”—he bowed slightly toward Caplain Malan—“the same plan——”
4188,PART II,
4189,PART II,I had followed the clear precision of each word with a dumb amazement
4190,PART II,which seemed to leave my mind abnormally clear. I saw Captain Malan’s
4191,PART II,eye turn from Moorshed and seek that of the _Cryptic’s_ commander. And
4192,PART II,he telegraphed as clearly as Moorshed was speaking: “My dear friend and
4193,PART II,"brother officer, _I_ know Panke; _you_ know Panke; _we_ know Panke—good"
4194,PART II,little Panke! In less than three Greenwich chronometer seconds Panke
4195,PART II,"will make an enormous ass of himself, and I shall have to put things"
4196,PART II,"straight, unless you who are a man of tact and discernment——”"
4197,PART II,
4198,PART II,“Carry on.” The Commander’s order supplied the unspoken word. The
4199,PART II,cruiser boiled about her business around us; watch and watch officers
4200,PART II,"together, up to the limit of noise permissible. I saw Captain Malan"
4201,PART II,turn to his senior.
4202,PART II,
4203,PART II,"“Come to my cabin!” said Panke gratingly, and led the way. Pyecroft and"
4204,PART II,I stayed still.
4205,PART II,
4206,PART II,"“It’s all right,” said Pyecroft. “They daren’t leave us loose aboard"
4207,PART II,"for one revolution,” and I knew that he had seen what I had seen."
4208,PART II,
4209,PART II,"“You, too!” said Captain Malan, returning suddenly. We passed the"
4210,PART II,"sentry between white enamelled walls of speckless small arms, and since"
4211,PART II,that Royal Marine Light infantryman was visibly suffocating from
4212,PART II,"curiosity, I winked at him. We entered the chintz-adorned,"
4213,PART II,"photo-speckled, brass-fendered, tile-stoved main cabin. Moorshed, with"
4214,PART II,"a ruler, was demonstrating before the frame-plan of H.M.S. _Cryptic_."
4215,PART II,
4216,PART II,"“—making nine stencils in all of my initials G.M.,” I heard him say."
4217,PART II,"“Further, you will find attached to your rudder, and you, too, Sir”—he"
4218,PART II,bowed to Captain Malan yet again—“one fourteen-inch Mark IV practice
4219,PART II,"torpedo, as issued to first-class torpedo-boats, properly buoyed. I"
4220,PART II,"have sent full particulars by telegraph to the umpires, and have"
4221,PART II,requested them to judge on the facts as they—appear.” He nodded through
4222,PART II,the large window to the stencilled _Devolution_ awink with brass work
4223,PART II,"in the morning sun, and ceased."
4224,PART II,
4225,PART II,"Captain Panke faced us. I remembered that this was only play, and"
4226,PART II,caught myself wondering with what keener agony comes the real defeat.
4227,PART II,
4228,PART II,"“Good God, Johnny!” he said, dropping his lower lip like a child, “this"
4229,PART II,young pup says he has put us both out of action. Inconceivable—eh? My
4230,PART II,first command of one of the class. Eh? What shall we do with him? What
4231,PART II,shall we do with him—eh?”
4232,PART II,
4233,PART II,"“As far as I can see, there’s no getting over the stencils,” his"
4234,PART II,companion answered.
4235,PART II,
4236,PART II,“Why didn’t I have the nets down? Why didn’t I have the nets down?” The
4237,PART II,cry tore itself from Captain Panke’s chest as he twisted his hands.
4238,PART II,
4239,PART II,“I suppose we’d better wait and find out what the umpires will say. The
4240,PART II,Admiral won’t be exactly pleased.” Captain Malan spoke very soothingly.
4241,PART II,Moorshed looked out through the stern door at Two Six Seven. Pyecroft
4242,PART II,"and I, at attention, studied the paintwork opposite. Captain Panke had"
4243,PART II,"dropped into his desk chair, and scribbled nervously at a blotting-pad."
4244,PART II,
4245,PART II,"Just before the tension became unendurable, he looked at his junior for"
4246,PART II,"a lead. “What—what are you going to do about it, Johnny—eh?”"
4247,PART II,
4248,PART II,"“Well, if you don’t want him, I’m going to ask this young gentleman to"
4249,PART II,"breakfast, and then we’ll make and mend clothes till the umpires have"
4250,PART II,decided.”
4251,PART II,
4252,PART II,Captain Panke flung out a hand swiftly.
4253,PART II,
4254,PART II,"“Come with me,” said Captain Malan. “Your men had better go back in the"
4255,PART II,dinghy to—their—own—ship.”
4256,PART II,
4257,PART II,"“Yes, I think so,” said Moorshed, and passed out behind the captain. We"
4258,PART II,"followed at a respectful interval, waiting till they had ascended the"
4259,PART II,ladder.
4260,PART II,
4261,PART II,"Said the sentry, rigid as the naked barometer behind him: “For Gawd’s"
4262,PART II,"sake! ’Ere, come ’ere! For Gawd’s sake! What’s ’appened? Oh! come"
4263,PART II,’_ere_ an’ tell.”
4264,PART II,
4265,PART II,"“Tell? You?” said Pyecroft. Neither man’s lips moved, and the words"
4266,PART II,were whispers: “Your ultimate illegitimate grandchildren might begin to
4267,PART II,"understand, not you—nor ever will.”"
4268,PART II,
4269,PART II,"“Captain Malan’s galley away, Sir,” cried a voice above; and one"
4270,PART II,replied: “Then get those two greasers into their dinghy and hoist the
4271,PART II,blue peter. We’re out of action.”
4272,PART II,
4273,PART II,"“Can you do it, Sir?” said Pyecroft at the foot of the ladder. “Do you"
4274,PART II,"think it is in the English language, or do you not?”"
4275,PART II,
4276,PART II,"“I don’t think I can, but I’ll try. If it takes me two years, I’ll"
4277,PART II,try.”
4278,PART II,
4279,PART II,
4280,PART II,There are witnesses who can testify that I have used no artifice. I
4281,PART II,"have, on the contrary, cut away priceless slabs of _opus alexandrinum_."
4282,PART II,"My gold I have lacquered down to dull bronze, my purples overlaid with"
4283,PART II,"sepia of the sea, and for hell-hearted ruby and blinding diamond I have"
4284,PART II,substituted pale amethyst and mere jargoon. Because I would say again
4285,PART II,“Disregarding the inventions of the Marine Captain whose other name is
4286,PART II,"Gubbins, let a plain statement suffice.”"

4338,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Private Copper crawled up the side of a bluish rock-strewn hill thinly
4339,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"fringed with brush atop, and remembering how he had peered at Sussex"
4340,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"conies through the edge of furze-clumps, cautiously parted the dry"

4369,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4370,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“You,” said Copper, thinking, somehow, of the crushing answers he had"
4371,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"never given to the young squire, “are a renegid. Why, you ain’t Dutch."
4372,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"You’re English, same as me.”"
4373,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4374,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“_No_, khaki. If you cannot talk civilly to a gentleman I will blow"
4375,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,your head off.”
4376,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4377,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"Copper cringed, and the action overbalanced him so that he rolled some"
4378,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"six or eight feet downhill, under the lee of a rough rock. His brain"
4379,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,was working with a swiftness and clarity strange in all his experience
4380,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"of Alf Copper. While he rolled he spoke, and the voice from his own"
4381,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"jaws amazed him: “If you did, ’twouldn’t make you any less of a"
4382,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,renegid.” As a useful afterthought he added: “I’ve sprained my ankle.”
4383,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4384,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,The young man was at his side in a flash. Copper made no motion to
4385,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"rise, but, cross-legged under the rock, grunted: “’Ow much did old"
4386,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Krujer pay you for this? What was you wanted for at ’ome? Where did you
4387,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,desert from?”
4388,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4389,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Khaki,” said the young man, sitting down in his turn, “you are a shade"
4390,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,better than your mates. You did not make much more noise than a yoke of
4391,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"oxen when you tried to come up this hill, but you are an ignorant"
4392,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,diseased beast like the rest of your people—eh? When you were at the
4393,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"Ragged Schools did they teach you any history, Tommy—’istory I mean?”"
4394,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4395,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Don’t need no schoolin’ to know a renegid,” said Copper. He had made"
4396,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"three yards down the hill—out of sight, unless they could see through"
4397,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"rocks, of the enemy’s smoking party."
4398,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4399,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,The young man laughed; and tossed the soldier a black sweating stick of
4400,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“True Affection.” (Private Copper had not smoked a pipe for three
4401,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,weeks.)
4402,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4403,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“_You_ don’t get this—eh?” said the young man. “_We_ do. We take it
4404,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,from the trains as we want it. You can keep the cake—you po-ah Tommee.”
4405,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Copper rammed the good stuff into his long-cold pipe and puffed
4406,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"luxuriously. Two years ago the sister of gunner-guard De Souza, East"
4407,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"India Railway, had, at a dance given by the sergeants to the Allahabad"
4408,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"Railway Volunteers, informed Copper that she could not think of"
4409,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,waltzing with “a poo-ah Tommee.” Private Copper wondered why that
4410,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,memory should have returned at this hour.
4411,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4412,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“I’m going to waste a little trouble on you before I send you back to
4413,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,your picket _quite_ naked—eh? Then you can say how you were overpowered
4414,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,by twenty of us and fired off your last round—like the men we picked up
4415,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,at the drift playing cards at Stryden’s farm—eh? What’s your name—eh?”
4416,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4417,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Private Copper thought for a moment of a far-away housemaid who might
4418,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"still, if the local postman had not gone too far, be interested in his"
4419,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"fate. On the other hand, he was, by temperament, economical of the"
4420,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"truth. “Pennycuik,” he said, “John Pennycuik.”"
4421,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4422,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Thank you. Well, Mr. John Pennycuik, I’m going to teach you a little"
4423,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"’istory, as you’d call it—eh?”"
4424,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4425,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“’Ow!” said Copper, stuffing his left hand in his mouth. “So long since"
4426,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,I’ve smoked I’ve burned my ’and—an’ the pipe’s dropped too. No
4427,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"objection to my movin’ down to fetch it, is there—Sir?”"
4428,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4429,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“I’ve got you covered,” said the young man, graciously, and Private"
4430,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"Copper, hopping on one leg, because of his sprain, recovered the pipe"
4431,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,yet another three yards downhill and squatted under another rock
4432,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,slightly larger than the first. A roundish boulder made a pleasant rest
4433,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"for his captor, who sat cross-legged once more, facing Copper, his"
4434,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"rifle across his knee, his hand on the trigger-guard."
4435,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4436,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Well, Mr. Pennycuik, as I was going to tell you. A little after you"
4437,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"were born in your English workhouse, your kind, honourable, brave"
4438,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"country, England, sent an English gentleman, who could not tell a lie,"
4439,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,to say that so long as the sun rose and the rivers ran in their courses
4440,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"the Transvaal would belong to England. Did you ever hear that,"
4441,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,khaki—eh?”
4442,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4443,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Oh no, Sir,” said Copper. This sentence about the sun and the rivers"
4444,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"happened to be a very aged jest of McBride, the professional humorist"
4445,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"of D Company, when they discussed the probable length of the war."
4446,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Copper had thrown beef-tins at McBride in the grey dawn of many wet and
4447,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,dry camps for intoning it.
4448,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4449,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“_Of_ course you would not. Now, mann, I tell you, listen.” He spat"
4450,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"aside and cleared his throat. “Because of that little promise, my"
4451,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,father he moved into the Transvaal and bought a farm—a little place of
4452,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"twenty or thirty thousand acres, don’t—you—know.”"
4453,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4454,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"The tone, in spite of the sing-song cadence fighting with the laboured"
4455,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"parody of the English drawl, was unbearably like the young Wilmington"
4456,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"squire’s, and Copper found himself saying: “I ought to. I’ve ’elped"
4457,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,burn some.”
4458,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4459,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Yes, you’ll pay for that later. _And_ he opened a store.”"
4460,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4461,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“Ho! Shopkeeper was he?”
4462,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4463,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“The kind you call “Sir” and sweep the floor for, Pennycuik…. You see,"
4464,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,in those days one used to believe in the British Government. My father
4465,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,did. _Then_ the Transvaal wiped thee earth with the English. They beat
4466,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,them six times running. You know _thatt_—eh?”
4467,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4468,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“Isn’t what we’ve come ’ere for.”
4469,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4470,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“_But_ my father (he knows better now) kept on believing in the
4471,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,English. I suppose it was the pretty talk about rivers and suns that
4472,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"cheated him—eh? Anyhow, he believed in his own country. Inn his own"
4473,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,country. _So_—you see—he was a little startled when he found himself
4474,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,handed over to the Transvaal as a prisoner of war. That’s what it came
4475,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"to, Tommy—a prisoner of war. You know what that is—eh? England was too"
4476,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,honourable and too gentlemanly to take trouble. There were no terms
4477,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,made for my father.”
4478,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4479,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“So ’e made ’em ’imself. Useful old bird.” Private Copper sliced up
4480,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"another pipeful and looked out across the wrinkled sea of kopjes,"
4481,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"through which came the roar of the rushing Orange River, so unlike"
4482,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,quiet Cuckmere.
4483,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4484,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,The young man’s face darkened. “I think I shall sjambok you myself when
4485,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"I’ve quite done with you. _No_, my father (he was a fool) made no terms"
4486,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,for eight years—ninety-six months—and for every day of them the
4487,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Transvaal made his life hell for my father and—his people.”
4488,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4489,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“I’m glad to hear that,” said the impenitent Copper."
4490,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4491,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“Are you? You can think of it when I’m taking the skin off your
4492,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"back—eh?… My father, he lost everything—everything down to his"
4493,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,self-respect. You don’t know what _thatt_ means—eh?”
4494,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4495,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“Why?” said Copper. “I’m smokin’ baccy stole by a renegid. Why wouldn’t
4496,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,I know?”
4497,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4498,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,If it came to a flogging on that hillside there might be a chance of
4499,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"reprisals. Of course, he might be marched to the Boer camp in the next"
4500,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,valley and there operated upon; but Army life teaches no man to cross
4501,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,bridges unnecessarily.
4502,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4503,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Yes, after eight years, my father, cheated by your bitch of a country,"
4504,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,he found out who was the upper dog in South Africa.”
4505,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4506,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“That’s me,” said Copper valiantly. “If it takes another ’alf century,"
4507,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,it’s me an’ the likes of me.”
4508,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4509,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“You? Heaven help you! You’ll be screaming at a wagon-wheel in an
4510,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,hour…. Then it struck my father that he’d like to shoot the people
4511,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,who’d betrayed him. You—you—_you_! He told his son all about it. He
4512,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,told him never to trust the English. He told him to do them all the
4513,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"harm he could. Mann, I tell you, I don’t want much telling. I was born"
4514,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"in the Transvaal—I’m a burgher. If my father didn’t love the English,"
4515,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"by the Lord, mann, I tell you, I hate them from the bottom of my soul.”"
4516,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4517,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"The voice quavered and ran high. Once more, for no conceivable reason,"
4518,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Private Copper found his inward eye turned upon Umballa cantonments of
4519,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"a dry dusty afternoon, when the saddle-coloured son of a local"
4520,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,hotel-keeper came to the barracks to complain of a theft of fowls. He
4521,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"saw the dark face, the plover’s-egg-tinted eyeballs, and the thin"
4522,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"excited hands. Above all, he remembered the passionate, queerly-strung"
4523,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"words. Slowly he returned to South Africa, using the very sentence his"
4524,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,sergeant had used to the poultry man.
4525,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4526,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“Go on with your complaint. I’m listenin’.”
4527,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4528,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Complaint! Complaint about _you_, you ox! We strip and kick your sort"
4529,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,by thousands.”
4530,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4531,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"The young man rocked to and fro above the rifle, whose muzzle thus"
4532,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,deflected itself from the pit of Private Copper’s stomach. His face was
4533,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,dusky with rage.
4534,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4535,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Yess, I’m a Transvaal burgher. It took us about twenty years to find"
4536,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,out how rotten you were. _We_ know and you know it now. Your army—it is
4537,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,the laughing-stock of the Continent.” He tapped the newspaper in his
4538,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"pocket. “You think you’re going to win, you poor fools. Your"
4539,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,people—your own people—your silly rotten fools of people will crawl out
4540,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,of it as they did after Majuba. They are beginning now. Look what your
4541,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"own working classes, the diseased, lying, drinking white stuff that you"
4542,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"come out of, are saying.” He thrust the English weekly, doubled at the"
4543,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"leading article, on Copper’s knee. “See what dirty dogs your masters"
4544,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,are. They do not even back you in your dirty work. _We_ cleared the
4545,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,country down to Ladysmith—to Estcourt. We cleared the country down to
4546,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Colesberg.”
4547,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4548,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Yes, we ’ad to clean up be’ind you. Messy, I call it.”"
4549,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4550,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“You’ve had to stop farm-burning because your people daren’t do it.
4551,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,They were afraid. You daren’t kill a spy. You daren’t shoot a spy when
4552,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,you catch him in your own uniform. You daren’t touch our loyall people
4553,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,in Cape Town! Your masters won’t let you. You will feed our women and
4554,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,children till we are quite ready to take them back. _You_ can’t put
4555,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,your cowardly noses out of the towns you say you’ve occupied. _You_
4556,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,daren’t move a convoy twenty miles. You think you’ve done something?
4557,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"You’ve done nothing, and you’ve taken a quarter of a million of men to"
4558,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,do it! There isn’t a nigger in South Africa that doesn’t obey us if we
4559,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,lift our finger. You pay the stuff four pounds a month and they lie to
4560,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"you. _We_ flog ’em, as I shall flog you.”"
4561,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4562,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,He clasped his hands together and leaned forward his out-thrust chin
4563,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"within two feet of Copper’s left, or pipe hand."
4564,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4565,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Yuss,” said Copper, “it’s a fair knock-out.” The fist landed to a hair"
4566,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"on the chin-point, the neck snicked like a gun-lock, and the back of"
4567,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,the head crashed on the boulder behind.
4568,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4569,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"Copper grabbed up both rifles, unshipped the cross-bandoliers, drew"
4570,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"forth the English weekly, and picking up the lax hands, looked long and"
4571,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,intently at the fingernails.
4572,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4573,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“No! Not a sign of it there,” he said. “’Is nails are as clean as"
4574,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"mine—but he talks just like ’em, though. And he’s a landlord too! A"
4575,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"landed proprietor! Shockin’, I call it.”"
4576,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4577,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,The arms began to flap with returning consciousness. Private Copper
4578,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"rose up and whispered: “If you open your head, I’ll bash it.” There was"
4579,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,no suggestion of sprain in the flung-back left boot. “Now walk in front
4580,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"of me, both arms perpendicularly elevated. I’m only a third-class shot,"
4581,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"so, if you don’t object, I’ll rest the muzzle of my rifle lightly but"
4582,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,firmly on your collar-button—coverin’ the serviceable vertebree. If
4583,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"your friends see us thus engaged, you pray—’ard.”"
4584,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4585,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Private and prisoner staggered downhill. No shots broke the peace of
4586,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"the afternoon, but once the young man checked and was sick."
4587,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4588,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“There’s a lot of things I could say to you,” Copper observed, at the"
4589,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"close of the paroxysm, “but it doesn’t matter. Look ’ere, you call me"
4590,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,‘pore Tommy’ again.”
4591,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4592,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,The prisoner hesitated.
4593,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4594,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Oh, I ain’t goin’ to do anythin’ _to_ you. I’m recon-noiterin’ in my"
4595,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,own. Say ‘pore Tommy’ ’alf-a-dozen times.”
4596,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4597,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,The prisoner obeyed.
4598,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4599,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“_That’s_ what’s been puzzlin’ me since I ’ad the pleasure o’ meetin’
4600,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"you,” said Copper. “You ain’t ’alf-caste, but you talk"
4601,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,_chee-chee_—_pukka_ bazar chee-chee. _Pro_ceed.”
4602,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4603,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Hullo,” said the Sergeant of the picket, twenty minutes later, “where"
4604,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,did you round him up?”
4605,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4606,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“On the top o’ yonder craggy mounting. There’s a mob of ’em sitting
4607,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,round their Bibles seventeen ’undred yards (you said it was seventeen
4608,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,’undred?) t’other side—an’ I want some coffee.” He sat down on the
4609,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,smoke-blackened stones by the fire.
4610,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4611,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“’Ow did you get ’im?” said McBride, professional humorist, quietly"
4612,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,filching the English weekly from under Copper’s armpit.
4613,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4614,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“On the chin—while ’e was waggin’ it at me.”
4615,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4616,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“What is ’e? ’Nother Colonial rebel to be ’orribly disenfranchised, or"
4617,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"a Cape Minister, or only a loyal farmer with dynamite in both boots."
4618,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"Tell us all about it, Burjer!”"
4619,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4620,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“You leave my prisoner alone,” said Private Copper. “’E’s ’ad losses"
4621,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,an’ trouble; an’ it’s in the family too. ’E thought I never read the

4623,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,explained it to me as patronisin’ as a—as a militia subaltern doin’

4625,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"kind, an’ ’earin’ the evidence as I did, I don’t exactly blame ’im. It"
4626,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,was this way.”
4627,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4628,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,To the picket Private Copper held forth for ten minutes on the
4629,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"life-history of his captive. Allowing for some purple patches, it was"
4630,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,an absolute fair rendering.
4631,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4632,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“But what I dis-liked was this baccy-priggin’ beggar, ’oo’s people, on"

4638,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Yes; that’s what it was: a bloomin’ aristocracy.”
4639,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,

4732,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,As the picket neared the camp it broke into song that was heard among

4744,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Said a captain a mile away: “Why are they singing _that?_ We haven’t

4746,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4747,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"An hour later the same captain said to his servant: “Jenkins, I"

4751,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4752,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Yes, Sir. Copy of the _Times_, Sir,” said Jenkins, without a quiver,"
4753,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,and went forth to make his own arrangements.
4754,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4755,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,"“Copy of the _Times_,” said the blameless Alf, from beneath his"
4756,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,blanket. “I ain’t a member of the Soldier’s Institoot. Go an’ look in

4759,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,
4760,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,Jenkins summarised briefly in a tense whisper the thing that Alf Copper

4763,THE COMPREHENSION OF PRIVATE COPPER,“But my particular copy of the _Times_ is specially pro’ibited by the

4823,STEAM TACTICS,I caught sight of their faces as we came up behind the cart in the
4824,STEAM TACTICS,"narrow Sussex lane; but though it was not eleven o’clock, they were"
4825,STEAM TACTICS,both asleep.
4826,STEAM TACTICS,
4827,STEAM TACTICS,That the carrier was on the wrong side of the road made no difference
4828,STEAM TACTICS,"to his language when I rang my bell. He said aloud of motor-cars, and"
4829,STEAM TACTICS,"specially of steam ones, all the things which I had read in the faces"
4830,STEAM TACTICS,of superior coachmen. Then he pulled slantwise across me.
4831,STEAM TACTICS,
4832,STEAM TACTICS,There was a vociferous steam air-pump attached to that car which could
4833,STEAM TACTICS,be applied at pleasure….
4834,STEAM TACTICS,
4835,STEAM TACTICS,The cart was removed about a bowshot’s length in seven and a quarter
4836,STEAM TACTICS,"seconds, to the accompaniment of parcels clattering. At the foot of the"
4837,STEAM TACTICS,"next hill the horse stopped, and the two men came out over the"
4838,STEAM TACTICS,tail-board.
4839,STEAM TACTICS,
4840,STEAM TACTICS,"My engineer backed and swung the car, ready to move out of reach."
4841,STEAM TACTICS,
4842,STEAM TACTICS,"“The blighted egg-boiler has steam up,” said Mr. Hinchcliffe, pausing"
4843,STEAM TACTICS,"to gather a large stone. “Temporise with the beggar, Pye, till the"
4844,STEAM TACTICS,sights come on!”
4845,STEAM TACTICS,
4846,STEAM TACTICS,"“I can’t leave my ’orse!” roared the carrier; “but bring ’em up ’ere,"
4847,STEAM TACTICS,an’ I’ll kill ’em all over again.”
4848,STEAM TACTICS,
4849,STEAM TACTICS,"“Good morning, Mr. Pyecroft,” I called cheerfully. “Can I give you a"
4850,STEAM TACTICS,lift anywhere?”
4851,STEAM TACTICS,
4852,STEAM TACTICS,The attack broke up round my forewheels.
4853,STEAM TACTICS,
4854,STEAM TACTICS,"“Well, we _do_ ’ave the knack o’ meeting _in puris naturalibus,_ as"
4855,STEAM TACTICS,"I’ve so often said.” Mr. Pyecroft wrung my hand. “Yes, I’m on leaf."
4856,STEAM TACTICS,So’s Hinch. We’re visiting friends among these kopjes.”
4857,STEAM TACTICS,
4858,STEAM TACTICS,"A monotonous bellowing up the road persisted, where the carrier was"
4859,STEAM TACTICS,still calling for corpses.
4860,STEAM TACTICS,
4861,STEAM TACTICS,“That’s Agg. He’s Hinch’s cousin. You aren’t fortunit in your family
4862,STEAM TACTICS,"connections, Hinch. ’E’s usin’ language in derogation of good manners."
4863,STEAM TACTICS,Go and abolish ’im.”
4864,STEAM TACTICS,
4865,STEAM TACTICS,Henry Salt Hinchcliffe stalked back to the cart and spoke to his
4866,STEAM TACTICS,cousin. I recall much that the wind bore to me of his words and the
4867,STEAM TACTICS,carrier’s. It seemed as if the friendship of years were dissolving amid
4868,STEAM TACTICS,throes.
4869,STEAM TACTICS,
4870,STEAM TACTICS,"“’Ave it your own silly way, then,” roared the carrier, “an’ get into"
4871,STEAM TACTICS,Linghurst on your own silly feet. I’ve done with you two runagates.” He
4872,STEAM TACTICS,lashed his horse and passed out of sight still rumbling.
4873,STEAM TACTICS,
4874,STEAM TACTICS,"“The fleet’s sailed,” said Pyecroft, “leavin’ us on the beach as"
4875,STEAM TACTICS,before. Had you any particular port in your mind?”
4876,STEAM TACTICS,
4877,STEAM TACTICS,"“Well, I was going to meet a friend at Instead Wick, but I don’t mind—”"
4878,STEAM TACTICS,
4879,STEAM TACTICS,"“Oh! that’ll do as well as anything! We’re on leaf, you see.”"
4880,STEAM TACTICS,
4881,STEAM TACTICS,"“She’ll hardly hold four,” said my engineer. I had broken him of the"
4882,STEAM TACTICS,"foolish habit of being surprised at things, but he was visibly uneasy."
4883,STEAM TACTICS,
4884,STEAM TACTICS,"Hinchcliffe returned, drawn as by ropes to my steam-car, round which he"
4885,STEAM TACTICS,walked in narrowing circles.
4886,STEAM TACTICS,
4887,STEAM TACTICS,“What’s her speed?” he demanded of the engineer.
4888,STEAM TACTICS,
4889,STEAM TACTICS,"“Twenty-five,” said that loyal man."
4890,STEAM TACTICS,
4891,STEAM TACTICS,“Easy to run?”
4892,STEAM TACTICS,
4893,STEAM TACTICS,"“No; very difficult,” was the emphatic answer."
4894,STEAM TACTICS,
4895,STEAM TACTICS,“That just shows that you ain’t fit for your rating. D’you suppose that
4896,STEAM TACTICS,a man who earns his livin’ by runnin’ 30-knot destroyers for a
4897,STEAM TACTICS,"parstime—for a parstime, mark you!—is going to lie down before any"
4898,STEAM TACTICS,blighted land-crabbing steam-pinnace on springs?”
4899,STEAM TACTICS,
4900,STEAM TACTICS,Yet that was what he did. Directly under the car he lay and looked
4901,STEAM TACTICS,"upward into pipes—petrol, steam, and water—with a keen and searching"
4902,STEAM TACTICS,eye.
4903,STEAM TACTICS,
4904,STEAM TACTICS,I telegraphed Mr. Pyecroft a question.
4905,STEAM TACTICS,
4906,STEAM TACTICS,"“Not—in—the—least,” was the answer. “Steam gadgets always take him that"
4907,STEAM TACTICS,way. We had a bit of a riot at Parsley Green through his tryin’ to show
4908,STEAM TACTICS,a traction-engine haulin’ gipsy-wagons how to turn corners.”
4909,STEAM TACTICS,
4910,STEAM TACTICS,"“Tell him everything he wants to know,” I said to the engineer, as I"
4911,STEAM TACTICS,dragged out a rug and spread it on the roadside.
4912,STEAM TACTICS,
4913,STEAM TACTICS,"“_He_ don’t want much showing,” said the engineer. Now, the two men had"
4914,STEAM TACTICS,"not, counting the time we took to stuff our pipes, been together more"
4915,STEAM TACTICS,than three minutes.
4916,STEAM TACTICS,
4917,STEAM TACTICS,"“This,” said Pyecroft, driving an elbow back into the deep verdure of"
4918,STEAM TACTICS,"the hedge-foot, “is a little bit of all right. Hinch, I shouldn’t let"
4919,STEAM TACTICS,too much o’ that hot muckings drop in my eyes. Your leaf’s up in a
4920,STEAM TACTICS,"fortnight, an’ you’ll be wantin’ ’em.”"
4921,STEAM TACTICS,
4922,STEAM TACTICS,"“Here!” said Hinchcliffe, still on his back, to the engineer. “Come"
4923,STEAM TACTICS,here and show me the lead of this pipe.” And the engineer lay down
4924,STEAM TACTICS,beside him.
4925,STEAM TACTICS,
4926,STEAM TACTICS,"“That’s all right,” said Mr. Hinchcliffe, rising. “But she’s more of a"
4927,STEAM TACTICS,bag of tricks than I thought. Unship this superstructure aft”—he
4928,STEAM TACTICS,pointed to the back seat—“and I’ll have a look at the forced draught.”
4929,STEAM TACTICS,
4930,STEAM TACTICS,The engineer obeyed with alacrity. I heard him volunteer the fact that
4931,STEAM TACTICS,he had a brother an artificer in the Navy.
4932,STEAM TACTICS,
4933,STEAM TACTICS,"“They couple very well, those two,” said Pyecroft critically, while"
4934,STEAM TACTICS,Hinchcliffe sniffed round the asbestos-lagged boiler and turned on gay
4935,STEAM TACTICS,jets of steam.
4936,STEAM TACTICS,
4937,STEAM TACTICS,"“Now take me up the road,” he said. My man, for form’s sake, looked at"
4938,STEAM TACTICS,me.
4939,STEAM TACTICS,
4940,STEAM TACTICS,"“Yes, take him,” I said. “He’s all right.”"
4941,STEAM TACTICS,
4942,STEAM TACTICS,"“No, I’m not,” said Hinchcliffe of a sudden—“not if I’m expected to"
4943,STEAM TACTICS,judge my water out of a little shaving-glass.”
4944,STEAM TACTICS,
4945,STEAM TACTICS,The water-gauge of that steam-car was reflected on a mirror to the
4946,STEAM TACTICS,right of the dashboard. I also had found it inconvenient.
4947,STEAM TACTICS,
4948,STEAM TACTICS,“Throw up your arm and look at the gauge under your armpit. Only mind
4949,STEAM TACTICS,"how you steer while you’re doing it, or you’ll get ditched!” I cried,"
4950,STEAM TACTICS,as the car ran down the road.
4951,STEAM TACTICS,
4952,STEAM TACTICS,"“I wonder!” said Pyecroft, musing. “But, after all, it’s your steamin’"
4953,STEAM TACTICS,"gadgets he’s usin’ for his libretto, as you might put it. He said to me"
4954,STEAM TACTICS,"after breakfast only this mornin’ ’ow he thanked his Maker, on all"
4955,STEAM TACTICS,"fours, that he wouldn’t see nor smell nor thumb a runnin’ bulgine till"
4956,STEAM TACTICS,the nineteenth prox. Now look at him! Only look at ’im!”
4957,STEAM TACTICS,
4958,STEAM TACTICS,"We could see, down the long slope of the road, my driver surrendering"
4959,STEAM TACTICS,"his seat to Hinchcliffe, while the car flickered generously from hedge"
4960,STEAM TACTICS,to hedge.
4961,STEAM TACTICS,
4962,STEAM TACTICS,“What happens if he upsets?”
4963,STEAM TACTICS,
4964,STEAM TACTICS,“The petrol will light up and the boiler may blow up.”
4965,STEAM TACTICS,
4966,STEAM TACTICS,“How rambunkshus! And”—Pyecroft blew a slow cloud—“Agg’s about three
4967,STEAM TACTICS,"hoops up this mornin’, too.”"
4968,STEAM TACTICS,
4969,STEAM TACTICS,"“What’s that to do with us? He’s gone down the road,” I retorted."
4970,STEAM TACTICS,
4971,STEAM TACTICS,"“Ye—es, but we’ll overtake him. He’s a vindictive carrier. He and Hinch"
4972,STEAM TACTICS,"’ad words about pig-breeding this morning. O’ course, Hinch don’t know"
4973,STEAM TACTICS,the elements o’ that evolution; but he fell back on ’is naval rank an’
4974,STEAM TACTICS,"office, an’ Agg grew peevish. I wasn’t sorry to get out of the cart …"
4975,STEAM TACTICS,"Have you ever considered how, when you an’ I meet, so to say, there’s"
4976,STEAM TACTICS,nearly always a remarkable hectic day ahead of us! Hullo! Behold the
4977,STEAM TACTICS,beef-boat returnin’!”
4978,STEAM TACTICS,
4979,STEAM TACTICS,"He rose as the car climbed up the slope, and shouted: “In bow! Way"
4980,STEAM TACTICS,’nuff!”
4981,STEAM TACTICS,
4982,STEAM TACTICS,"“You be quiet!” cried Hinchcliffe, and drew up opposite the rug, his"
4983,STEAM TACTICS,dark face shining with joy. “She’s the Poetry o’ Motion! She’s the
4984,STEAM TACTICS,"Angel’s Dream. She’s———” He shut off steam, and the slope being against"
4985,STEAM TACTICS,"her, the car slid soberly downhill again."
4986,STEAM TACTICS,
4987,STEAM TACTICS,“What’s this? I’ve got the brake on!” he yelled.
4988,STEAM TACTICS,
4989,STEAM TACTICS,"“It doesn’t hold backwards,” I said. “Put her on the mid-link.”"
4990,STEAM TACTICS,
4991,STEAM TACTICS,"“That’s a nasty one for the chief engineer o’ the _Djinn_, 31-knot,"
4992,STEAM TACTICS,"T.B.D.,” said Pyecroft. “_Do_ you know what the mid-link is, Hinch?”"
4993,STEAM TACTICS,
4994,STEAM TACTICS,Once more the car returned to us; but as Pyecroft stooped to gather up
4995,STEAM TACTICS,"the rug, Hinchcliffe jerked the lever testily, and with prawn-like"
4996,STEAM TACTICS,speed she retired backwards into her own steam.
4997,STEAM TACTICS,
4998,STEAM TACTICS,"“Apparently ’e don’t,” said Pyecroft. “What’s he done now, Sir?”"
4999,STEAM TACTICS,
5000,STEAM TACTICS,“Reversed her. I’ve done it myself.”
5001,STEAM TACTICS,
5002,STEAM TACTICS,“But he’s an engineer.”
5003,STEAM TACTICS,
5004,STEAM TACTICS,For the third time the car manœuvred up the hill.
5005,STEAM TACTICS,
5006,STEAM TACTICS,"“I’ll teach you to come alongside properly, if I keep you ’tiffies out"
5007,STEAM TACTICS,all night!” shouted Pyecroft. It was evidently a quotation.
5008,STEAM TACTICS,"Hinchcliffe’s face grew livid, and, his hand ever so slightly working"
5009,STEAM TACTICS,"on the throttle, the car buzzed twenty yards uphill."
5010,STEAM TACTICS,
5011,STEAM TACTICS,“That’s enough. We’ll take your word for it. The mountain will go to
5012,STEAM TACTICS,Ma’ommed. Stand _fast_!”
5013,STEAM TACTICS,
5014,STEAM TACTICS,Pyecroft and I and the rug marched up where she and Hinchcliffe fumed
5015,STEAM TACTICS,together.
5016,STEAM TACTICS,
5017,STEAM TACTICS,"“Not as easy as it looks—eh, Hinch?”"
5018,STEAM TACTICS,
5019,STEAM TACTICS,“It is dead easy. I’m going to drive her to Instead Wick—aren’t I?”
5020,STEAM TACTICS,said the first-class engine-room artificer. I thought of his
5021,STEAM TACTICS,"performances with No. 267 and nodded. After all, it was a small"
5022,STEAM TACTICS,privilege to accord to pure genius.
5023,STEAM TACTICS,
5024,STEAM TACTICS,"“But my engineer will stand by—at first,” I added."
5025,STEAM TACTICS,
5026,STEAM TACTICS,"“An’ you a family man, too,” muttered Pyecroft, swinging himself into"
5027,STEAM TACTICS,the right rear seat. “Sure to be a remarkably hectic day when we meet.”
5028,STEAM TACTICS,
5029,STEAM TACTICS,"We adjusted ourselves and, in the language of the immortal Navy doctor,"
5030,STEAM TACTICS,"paved our way towards Linghurst, distant by mile-post 11-3/4 miles."
5031,STEAM TACTICS,
5032,STEAM TACTICS,"Mr. Hinchcliffe, every nerve and muscle braced, talked only to the"
5033,STEAM TACTICS,"engineer, and that professionally. I recalled the time when I, too, had"
5034,STEAM TACTICS,enjoyed the rack on which he voluntarily extended himself.
5035,STEAM TACTICS,
5036,STEAM TACTICS,And the County of Sussex slid by in slow time.
5037,STEAM TACTICS,
5038,STEAM TACTICS,“How cautious is the ’tiffy-bird!” said Pyecroft.
5039,STEAM TACTICS,
5040,STEAM TACTICS,"“Even in a destroyer,” Hinch snapped over his shoulder, “you ain’t"
5041,STEAM TACTICS,expected to con and drive simultaneous. Don’t address any remarks to
5042,STEAM TACTICS,_me!_”
5043,STEAM TACTICS,
5044,STEAM TACTICS,“Pump!” said the engineer. “Your water’s droppin’.”
5045,STEAM TACTICS,
5046,STEAM TACTICS,“_I_ know that. Where the Heavens is that blighted by-pass?”
5047,STEAM TACTICS,
5048,STEAM TACTICS,He beat his right or throttle hand madly on the side of the car till he
5049,STEAM TACTICS,"found the bent rod that more or less controls the pump, and, neglecting"
5050,STEAM TACTICS,"all else, twisted it furiously."
5051,STEAM TACTICS,
5052,STEAM TACTICS,My engineer grabbed the steering-bar just in time to save us lurching
5053,STEAM TACTICS,into a ditch.
5054,STEAM TACTICS,
5055,STEAM TACTICS,"“If I was a burnin’ peacock, with two hundred bloodshot eyes in my"
5056,STEAM TACTICS,"shinin’ tail, I’d need ’em all on this job!” said Hinch."
5057,STEAM TACTICS,
5058,STEAM TACTICS,"“Don’t talk! Steer! This ain’t the North Atlantic,” Pyecroft replied."
5059,STEAM TACTICS,
5060,STEAM TACTICS,"“Blast my stokers! Why, the steam’s dropped fifty pounds!” Hinchcliffe"
5061,STEAM TACTICS,cried.
5062,STEAM TACTICS,
5063,STEAM TACTICS,"“Fire’s blown out,” said the engineer. “Stop her!”"
5064,STEAM TACTICS,
5065,STEAM TACTICS,"“Does she do that often?” said Hinch, descending."
5066,STEAM TACTICS,
5067,STEAM TACTICS,“Sometimes.”
5068,STEAM TACTICS,
5069,STEAM TACTICS,“Anytime?”
5070,STEAM TACTICS,
5071,STEAM TACTICS,“Any time a cross-wind catches her.”
5072,STEAM TACTICS,
5073,STEAM TACTICS,The engineer produced a match and stooped.
5074,STEAM TACTICS,
5075,STEAM TACTICS,"That car (now, thank Heaven, no more than an evil memory) never lit"
5076,STEAM TACTICS,"twice in the same fashion. This time she back-fired superbly, and"
5077,STEAM TACTICS,Pyecroft went out over the right rear wheel in a column of rich yellow
5078,STEAM TACTICS,flame.
5079,STEAM TACTICS,
5080,STEAM TACTICS,"“I’ve seen a mine explode at Bantry—once—prematoor,” he volunteered."
5081,STEAM TACTICS,
5082,STEAM TACTICS,"“That’s all right,” said Hinchcliffe, brushing down his singed beard"
5083,STEAM TACTICS,with a singed forefinger. (He had been watching too closely.) “Has she
5084,STEAM TACTICS,any more little surprises up her dainty sleeve?”
5085,STEAM TACTICS,
5086,STEAM TACTICS,"“She hasn’t begun yet,” said my engineer, with a scornful cough. “Some"
5087,STEAM TACTICS,one ’as opened the petrol-supply-valve too wide.”
5088,STEAM TACTICS,
5089,STEAM TACTICS,"“Change places with me, Pyecroft,” I commanded, for I remembered that"
5090,STEAM TACTICS,"the petrol-supply, the steam-lock, and the forced draught were all"
5091,STEAM TACTICS,controlled from the right rear seat.
5092,STEAM TACTICS,
5093,STEAM TACTICS,“Me? Why? There’s a whole switchboard full o’ nickel-plated muckin’s
5094,STEAM TACTICS,which I haven’t begun to play with yet. The starboard side’s crawlin’
5095,STEAM TACTICS,with ’em.”
5096,STEAM TACTICS,
5097,STEAM TACTICS,"“Change, or I’ll kill you!” said Hinchcliffe, and he looked like it."
5098,STEAM TACTICS,
5099,STEAM TACTICS,"“That’s the ’tiffy all over. When anything goes wrong, blame it on the"
5100,STEAM TACTICS,"lower deck. Navigate by your automatic self, then! _I_ won’t help you"
5101,STEAM TACTICS,any more.”
5102,STEAM TACTICS,
5103,STEAM TACTICS,We navigated for a mile in dead silence.
5104,STEAM TACTICS,
5105,STEAM TACTICS,“Talkin’ o’ wakes——” said Pyecroft suddenly.
5106,STEAM TACTICS,
5107,STEAM TACTICS,"“We weren’t,” Hinchcliffe grunted."
5108,STEAM TACTICS,
5109,STEAM TACTICS,"“There’s some wakes would break a snake’s back; but this of yours, so"
5110,STEAM TACTICS,"to speak, would fair turn a tapeworm giddy. That’s all I wish to"
5111,STEAM TACTICS,"observe, Hinch. … Cart at anchor on the port-bow. It’s Agg!”"
5112,STEAM TACTICS,
5113,STEAM TACTICS,Far up the shaded road into secluded Bromlingleigh we saw the carrier’s
5114,STEAM TACTICS,cart at rest before the post-office.
5115,STEAM TACTICS,
5116,STEAM TACTICS,“He’s bung in the fairway. How’m I to get past?” said Hinchcliffe.
5117,STEAM TACTICS,"“There’s no room. Here, Pye, come and relieve the wheel!”"
5118,STEAM TACTICS,
5119,STEAM TACTICS,"“Nay, nay, Pauline. You’ve made your own bed. You’ve as good as left"
5120,STEAM TACTICS,your happy home an’ family cart to steal it. Now you lie on it.”
5121,STEAM TACTICS,
5122,STEAM TACTICS,"“Ring your bell,” I suggested."
5123,STEAM TACTICS,
5124,STEAM TACTICS,"“Glory!” said Pyecroft, falling forward into the nape of Hinchcliffe’s"
5125,STEAM TACTICS,neck as the car stopped dead.
5126,STEAM TACTICS,
5127,STEAM TACTICS,"“Get out o’ my back-hair! That must have been the brake I touched off,”"
5128,STEAM TACTICS,"Hinchcliffe muttered, and repaired his error tumultuously."
5129,STEAM TACTICS,
5130,STEAM TACTICS,"We passed the cart as though we had been all Bruges belfry. Agg, from"
5131,STEAM TACTICS,"the port-office door, regarded us with a too pacific eye. I remembered"
5132,STEAM TACTICS,later that the pretty postmistress looked on us pityingly.
5133,STEAM TACTICS,
5134,STEAM TACTICS,Hinchcliffe wiped the sweat from his brow and drew breath. It was the
5135,STEAM TACTICS,"first vehicle that he had passed, and I sympathised with him."
5136,STEAM TACTICS,
5137,STEAM TACTICS,"“You needn’t grip so hard,” said my engineer. “She steers as easy as a"
5138,STEAM TACTICS,bicycle.”
5139,STEAM TACTICS,
5140,STEAM TACTICS,“Ho! You suppose I ride bicycles up an’ down my engine-room?” was the
5141,STEAM TACTICS,answer. “I’ve other things to think about. She’s a terror. She’s a
5142,STEAM TACTICS,whistlin’ lunatic. I’d sooner run the old South-Easter at Simon’s Town
5143,STEAM TACTICS,than her!”
5144,STEAM TACTICS,
5145,STEAM TACTICS,"“One of the nice things they say about her,” I interrupted, “is that no"
5146,STEAM TACTICS,engineer is needed to run this machine.”
5147,STEAM TACTICS,
5148,STEAM TACTICS,“No. They’d need about seven.”
5149,STEAM TACTICS,
5150,STEAM TACTICS,"“‘Common-sense only is needed,’” I quoted."
5151,STEAM TACTICS,
5152,STEAM TACTICS,"“Make a note of that, Hinch. Just common-sense,” Pyecroft put in."
5153,STEAM TACTICS,
5154,STEAM TACTICS,"“And now,” I said, “we’ll have to take in water. There isn’t more than"
5155,STEAM TACTICS,a couple of inches of water in the tank.”
5156,STEAM TACTICS,
5157,STEAM TACTICS,“Where d’you get it from?”
5158,STEAM TACTICS,
5159,STEAM TACTICS,“Oh!—cottages and such-like.”
5160,STEAM TACTICS,
5161,STEAM TACTICS,"“Yes, but that being so, where does your much-advertised twenty-five"
5162,STEAM TACTICS,miles an hour come in? Ain’t a dung-cart more to the point?”
5163,STEAM TACTICS,
5164,STEAM TACTICS,"“If you want to go anywhere, I suppose it would be,” I replied."
5165,STEAM TACTICS,
5166,STEAM TACTICS,“_I_ don’t want to go anywhere. I’m thinkin’ of you who’ve got to live
5167,STEAM TACTICS,with her. She’ll burn her tubes if she loses her water?”
5168,STEAM TACTICS,
5169,STEAM TACTICS,“She will.”
5170,STEAM TACTICS,
5171,STEAM TACTICS,"“I’ve never scorched yet, and I not beginnin’ now.” He shut off steam"
5172,STEAM TACTICS,"firmly. “Out you get, Pye, an’ shove her along by hand.”"
5173,STEAM TACTICS,
5174,STEAM TACTICS,“Where to?”
5175,STEAM TACTICS,
5176,STEAM TACTICS,"“The nearest water-tank,” was the reply. “And Sussex is a dry county.”"
5177,STEAM TACTICS,
5178,STEAM TACTICS,"“She ought to have drag-ropes—little pipe-clayed ones,” said Pyecroft."
5179,STEAM TACTICS,
5180,STEAM TACTICS,We got out and pushed under the hot sun for half-a-mile till we came to
5181,STEAM TACTICS,"a cottage, sparsely inhabited by one child who wept."
5182,STEAM TACTICS,
5183,STEAM TACTICS,"“All out haymakin’, o’ course,” said Pyecroft, thrusting his head into"
5184,STEAM TACTICS,the parlour for an instant. “What’s the evolution now?”
5185,STEAM TACTICS,
5186,STEAM TACTICS,"“Skirmish till we find a well,” I said."
5187,STEAM TACTICS,
5188,STEAM TACTICS,"“Hmm! But they wouldn’t ’ave left that kid without a chaperon, so to"
5189,STEAM TACTICS,say… I thought so! Where’s a stick?”
5190,STEAM TACTICS,
5191,STEAM TACTICS,A bluish and silent beast of the true old sheep-dog breed glided from
5192,STEAM TACTICS,behind an outhouse and without words fell to work.
5193,STEAM TACTICS,
5194,STEAM TACTICS,"Pyecroft kept him at bay with a rake-handle while our party, in"
5195,STEAM TACTICS,"rallying-square, retired along the box-bordered brick-path to the car."
5196,STEAM TACTICS,
5197,STEAM TACTICS,"At the garden gate the dumb devil halted, looked back on the child, and"
5198,STEAM TACTICS,sat down to scratch.
5199,STEAM TACTICS,
5200,STEAM TACTICS,"“That’s his three-mile limit, thank Heaven!” said Pyecroft. “Fall in,"
5201,STEAM TACTICS,"push-party, and proceed with land-transport o’ pinnace. I’ll protect"
5202,STEAM TACTICS,your flanks in case this sniffin’ flea-bag is tempted beyond ’is
5203,STEAM TACTICS,strength.”
5204,STEAM TACTICS,
5205,STEAM TACTICS,"We pushed off in silence. The car weighed 1,200 lb., and even on"
5206,STEAM TACTICS,ball-bearings was a powerful sudorific. From somewhere behind a hedge
5207,STEAM TACTICS,we heard a gross rustic laugh.
5208,STEAM TACTICS,
5209,STEAM TACTICS,"“Those are the beggars we lie awake for, patrollin’ the high seas."
5210,STEAM TACTICS,"There ain’t a port in China where we wouldn’t be better treated. Yes, a"
5211,STEAM TACTICS,"Boxer ’ud be ashamed of it,” said Pyecroft."
5212,STEAM TACTICS,
5213,STEAM TACTICS,A cloud of fine dust boomed down the road.
5214,STEAM TACTICS,
5215,STEAM TACTICS,“Some happy craft with a well-found engine-room! How different!” panted
5216,STEAM TACTICS,"Hinchcliffe, bent over the starboard mudguard."
5217,STEAM TACTICS,
5218,STEAM TACTICS,"It was a claret-coloured petrol car, and it stopped courteously, as"
5219,STEAM TACTICS,good cars will at sight of trouble.
5220,STEAM TACTICS,
5221,STEAM TACTICS,"“Water, only water,” I answered in reply to offers of help."
5222,STEAM TACTICS,
5223,STEAM TACTICS,“There’s a lodge at the end of these oak palings. They’ll give you all
5224,STEAM TACTICS,you want. Say I sent you. Gregory—Michael Gregory. Good-bye!”
5225,STEAM TACTICS,
5226,STEAM TACTICS,"“Ought to ’ave been in the Service. Prob’ly is,” was Pyecroft’s"
5227,STEAM TACTICS,comment.
5228,STEAM TACTICS,
5229,STEAM TACTICS,At that thrice-blessed lodge our water-tank was filled (I dare not
5230,STEAM TACTICS,quote Mr. Hinchcliffe’s remarks when he saw the collapsible rubber
5231,STEAM TACTICS,bucket with which we did it) and we re-embarked. It seemed that Sir
5232,STEAM TACTICS,"Michael Gregory owned many acres, and that his park ran for miles."
5233,STEAM TACTICS,
5234,STEAM TACTICS,"“No objection to your going through it,” said the lodge-keeper. “It’ll"
5235,STEAM TACTICS,save you a goodish bit to Instead Wick.”
5236,STEAM TACTICS,
5237,STEAM TACTICS,"But we needed petrol, which could be purchased at Pigginfold, a few"
5238,STEAM TACTICS,"miles farther up, and so we held to the main road, as our fate had"
5239,STEAM TACTICS,decreed.
5240,STEAM TACTICS,
5241,STEAM TACTICS,"“We’ve come seven miles in fifty-four minutes, so far,” said"
5242,STEAM TACTICS,Hinchcliffe (he was driving with greater freedom and less
5243,STEAM TACTICS,"responsibility), “and now we have to fill our bunkers. This is worse"
5244,STEAM TACTICS,than the Channel Fleet.”
5245,STEAM TACTICS,
5246,STEAM TACTICS,"At Pigginfold, after ten minutes, we refilled our petrol tank and"
5247,STEAM TACTICS,lavishly oiled our engines. Mr. Hinchcliffe wished to discharge our
5248,STEAM TACTICS,engineer on the grounds that he (Mr. Hinchcliffe) was now entirely
5249,STEAM TACTICS,"abreast of his work. To this I demurred, for I knew my car. She had, in"
5250,STEAM TACTICS,"the language of the road, held up for a day and a half, and by most"
5251,STEAM TACTICS,"bitter experience I suspected that her time was very near. Therefore,"
5252,STEAM TACTICS,"three miles short of Linghurst, I was less surprised than any one,"
5253,STEAM TACTICS,"excepting always my engineer, when the engines set up a lunatic"
5254,STEAM TACTICS,"clucking, and, after two or three kicks, jammed."
5255,STEAM TACTICS,
5256,STEAM TACTICS,“Heaven forgive me all the harsh things I may have said about
5257,STEAM TACTICS,"destroyers in my sinful time!” wailed Hinchcliffe, snapping back the"
5258,STEAM TACTICS,throttle. “What’s worryin’ Ada now?”
5259,STEAM TACTICS,
5260,STEAM TACTICS,"“The forward eccentric-strap screw’s dropped off,” said the engineer,"
5261,STEAM TACTICS,investigating.
5262,STEAM TACTICS,
5263,STEAM TACTICS,“That all? I thought it was a propeller-blade.”
5264,STEAM TACTICS,
5265,STEAM TACTICS,“We must go an’ look for it. There isn’t another.”
5266,STEAM TACTICS,
5267,STEAM TACTICS,"“Not me,” said Pyecroft from his seat. “Out pinnace, Hinch, an’ creep"
5268,STEAM TACTICS,for it. It won’t be more than five miles back.”
5269,STEAM TACTICS,
5270,STEAM TACTICS,"The two men, with bowed heads, moved up the road."
5271,STEAM TACTICS,
5272,STEAM TACTICS,"“Look like etymologists, don’t they? Does she decant her innards often,"
5273,STEAM TACTICS,so to speak?” Pyecroft asked.
5274,STEAM TACTICS,
5275,STEAM TACTICS,I told him the true tale of a race-full of ball bearings strewn four
5276,STEAM TACTICS,"miles along a Hampshire road, and by me recovered in detail. He was"
5277,STEAM TACTICS,profoundly touched.
5278,STEAM TACTICS,
5279,STEAM TACTICS,“Poor Hinch! Poor—poor Hinch!” he said. “And that’s only one of her
5280,STEAM TACTICS,"little games, is it? He’ll be homesick for the Navy by night.”"
5281,STEAM TACTICS,
5282,STEAM TACTICS,"When the search-party doubled back with the missing screw, it was"
5283,STEAM TACTICS,"Hinchcliffe who replaced it in less than five minutes, while my"
5284,STEAM TACTICS,engineer looked on admiringly.
5285,STEAM TACTICS,
5286,STEAM TACTICS,"“Your boiler’s only seated on four little paperclips,” he said,"
5287,STEAM TACTICS,crawling from beneath her. “She’s a wicker-willow lunch-basket below.
5288,STEAM TACTICS,She’s a runnin’ miracle. Have you had this combustible spirit-lamp
5289,STEAM TACTICS,long?”
5290,STEAM TACTICS,
5291,STEAM TACTICS,I told him.
5292,STEAM TACTICS,
5293,STEAM TACTICS,“And yet you were afraid to come into the _Nightmare’s_ engine-room
5294,STEAM TACTICS,when we were runnin’ trials!”
5295,STEAM TACTICS,
5296,STEAM TACTICS,"“It’s all a matter of taste,” Pyecroft volunteered. “But I will say for"
5297,STEAM TACTICS,"you, Hinch, you’ve certainly got the hang of her steamin’ gadgets in"
5298,STEAM TACTICS,quick time.”
5299,STEAM TACTICS,
5300,STEAM TACTICS,"He was driving her very sweetly, but with a worried look in his eye and"
5301,STEAM TACTICS,a tremor in his arm.
5302,STEAM TACTICS,
5303,STEAM TACTICS,"“She don’t seem so answer her helm somehow,” he said."
5304,STEAM TACTICS,
5305,STEAM TACTICS,"“There’s a lot of play to the steering-gear,” said my engineer. “We"
5306,STEAM TACTICS,generally tighten it up every few miles.”
5307,STEAM TACTICS,
5308,STEAM TACTICS,“‘Like me to stop now? We’ve run as much as one mile and a half without
5309,STEAM TACTICS,"incident,” he replied tartly."
5310,STEAM TACTICS,
5311,STEAM TACTICS,"“Then you’re lucky,” said my engineer, bristling in turn."
5312,STEAM TACTICS,
5313,STEAM TACTICS,“They’ll wreck the whole turret out o’ nasty professional spite in a
5314,STEAM TACTICS,"minute,” said Pyecroft. “That’s the worst o’ machinery. Man dead ahead,"
5315,STEAM TACTICS,Hinch—semaphorin’ like the flagship in a fit!”
5316,STEAM TACTICS,
5317,STEAM TACTICS,"“Amen!” said Hinchcliffe. “Shall I stop, or shall I cut him down?”"
5318,STEAM TACTICS,
5319,STEAM TACTICS,"He stopped, for full in the centre of the Linghurst Road stood a person"
5320,STEAM TACTICS,"in pepper-and-salt raiment (ready-made), with a brown telegraph"
5321,STEAM TACTICS,envelope in his hands.
5322,STEAM TACTICS,
5323,STEAM TACTICS,"“Twenty-three and a half miles an hour,” he began, weighing a small"
5324,STEAM TACTICS,beam-engine of a Waterbury in one red paw. “From the top of the hill
5325,STEAM TACTICS,over our measured quarter-mile—twenty-three and a half.”
5326,STEAM TACTICS,
5327,STEAM TACTICS,“You manurial gardener——” Hinchcliffe began. I prodded him warningly
5328,STEAM TACTICS,"from behind, and laid the other hand on Pyecroft’s stiffening knee."
5329,STEAM TACTICS,
5330,STEAM TACTICS,“Also—on information received—drunk and disorderly in charge of a
5331,STEAM TACTICS,"motor-car—to the common danger—two men like sailors in appearance,” the"
5332,STEAM TACTICS,man went on.
5333,STEAM TACTICS,
5334,STEAM TACTICS,“Like sailors! … That’s Agg’s little _roose_. No wonder he smiled at
5335,STEAM TACTICS,"us,” said Pyecroft."
5336,STEAM TACTICS,
5337,STEAM TACTICS,"“I’ve been waiting for you some time,” the man concluded, folding up"
5338,STEAM TACTICS,the telegram.
5339,STEAM TACTICS,
5340,STEAM TACTICS,“Who’s the owner?”
5341,STEAM TACTICS,
5342,STEAM TACTICS,I indicated myself.
5343,STEAM TACTICS,
5344,STEAM TACTICS,“Then I want you as well as the two seafaring men. Drunk and disorderly
5345,STEAM TACTICS,can be treated summary. You come on.”
5346,STEAM TACTICS,
5347,STEAM TACTICS,"My relations with the Sussex constabulary have, so far, been of the"
5348,STEAM TACTICS,"best, but I could not love this person."
5349,STEAM TACTICS,
5350,STEAM TACTICS,“Of course you have your authority to show?” I hinted.
5351,STEAM TACTICS,
5352,STEAM TACTICS,"“I’ll show it you at Linghurst,” he retorted hotly——“all the authority"
5353,STEAM TACTICS,you want.”
5354,STEAM TACTICS,
5355,STEAM TACTICS,"“I only want the badge, or warrant, or whatever it is a plain-clothes"
5356,STEAM TACTICS,man has to show.”
5357,STEAM TACTICS,
5358,STEAM TACTICS,"He made as though to produce it, but checked himself, repeating less"
5359,STEAM TACTICS,politely the invitation to Linghurst. The action and the tone confirmed
5360,STEAM TACTICS,my many-times tested theory that the bulk of English shoregoing
5361,STEAM TACTICS,institutions are based on conformable strata of absolutely impervious
5362,STEAM TACTICS,inaccuracy. I reflected and became aware of a drumming on the back of
5363,STEAM TACTICS,"the front seat that Pyecroft, bowed forward and relaxed, was tapping"
5364,STEAM TACTICS,with his knuckles. The hardly-checked fury on Hinchcliffe’s brow had
5365,STEAM TACTICS,"given place to a greasy imbecility, and he nodded over the"
5366,STEAM TACTICS,"steering-bar. In longs and shorts, as laid down by the pious and"
5367,STEAM TACTICS,"immortal Mr. Morse, Pyecroft tapped out, “Sham drunk. Get him in the"
5368,STEAM TACTICS,car.”
5369,STEAM TACTICS,
5370,STEAM TACTICS,"“I can’t stay here all day,” said the constable."
5371,STEAM TACTICS,
5372,STEAM TACTICS,Pyecroft raised his head. Then was seen with what majesty the British
5373,STEAM TACTICS,sailor-man envisages a new situation.
5374,STEAM TACTICS,
5375,STEAM TACTICS,"“Met gennelman heavy sheeway,” said he. “Do tell me British gelman"
5376,STEAM TACTICS,can’t give ’ole Brish Navy lif’ own blighted ste’ cart. Have another
5377,STEAM TACTICS,drink!”
5378,STEAM TACTICS,
5379,STEAM TACTICS,"“I didn’t know they were as drunk as all that when they stopped me,” I"
5380,STEAM TACTICS,explained.
5381,STEAM TACTICS,
5382,STEAM TACTICS,"“You can say all that at Linghurst,” was the answer. “Come on.”"
5383,STEAM TACTICS,
5384,STEAM TACTICS,"“Quite right,” I said. “But the question is, if you take these two out"
5385,STEAM TACTICS,"on the road, they’ll fall down or start killing you.”"
5386,STEAM TACTICS,
5387,STEAM TACTICS,“Then I’d call on you to assist me in the execution o’ my duty.”
5388,STEAM TACTICS,
5389,STEAM TACTICS,“But I’d see you further first. You’d better come with us in the car.
5390,STEAM TACTICS,"I’ll turn this passenger out.” (This was my engineer, sitting quite"
5391,STEAM TACTICS,"silent.) “You don’t want him, and, anyhow, he’d only be a witness for"
5392,STEAM TACTICS,the defence.”
5393,STEAM TACTICS,
5394,STEAM TACTICS,"“That’s true,” said the constable. “But it wouldn’t make any odds—at"
5395,STEAM TACTICS,Linghurst.”
5396,STEAM TACTICS,
5397,STEAM TACTICS,My engineer skipped into the bracken like a rabbit. I bade him cut
5398,STEAM TACTICS,"across Sir Michael Gregory’s park, and if he caught my friend, to tell"
5399,STEAM TACTICS,him I should probably be rather late for lunch.
5400,STEAM TACTICS,
5401,STEAM TACTICS,“I ain’t going to be driven by _him_.” Our destined prey pointed at
5402,STEAM TACTICS,Hinchcliffe with apprehension.
5403,STEAM TACTICS,
5404,STEAM TACTICS,“Of course not. You take my seat and keep the big sailor in order. He’s
5405,STEAM TACTICS,too drunk to do much. I’ll change places with the other one. Only be
5406,STEAM TACTICS,quick; I want to pay my fine and get it over.”
5407,STEAM TACTICS,
5408,STEAM TACTICS,"“That’s the way to look at it,” he said, dropping into the left rear"
5409,STEAM TACTICS,seat. “We’re making quite a lot out o’ you motor gentry.” He folded his
5410,STEAM TACTICS,arms judicially as the car gathered way under Hinchcliffe’s stealthy
5411,STEAM TACTICS,hand.
5412,STEAM TACTICS,
5413,STEAM TACTICS,"“But _you_ aren’t driving?” he cried, half rising."
5414,STEAM TACTICS,
5415,STEAM TACTICS,"“You’ve noticed it?” said Pyecroft, and embraced him with one"
5416,STEAM TACTICS,anaconda-like left arm.
5417,STEAM TACTICS,
5418,STEAM TACTICS,"“Don’t kill him,” said Hinchcliffe briefly. “I want to show him what"
5419,STEAM TACTICS,"twenty-three and a quarter is.” We were going a fair twelve, which was"
5420,STEAM TACTICS,about the car’s limit.
5421,STEAM TACTICS,
5422,STEAM TACTICS,Our passenger swore something and then groaned.
5423,STEAM TACTICS,
5424,STEAM TACTICS,"“Hush, darling!” said Pyecroft, “or I’ll have to hug you.”"
5425,STEAM TACTICS,
5426,STEAM TACTICS,"The main road, white under the noon sun, lay broad before us, running"
5427,STEAM TACTICS,north to Linghurst. We slowed and looked anxiously for a side track.
5428,STEAM TACTICS,
5429,STEAM TACTICS,"“And now,” said I, “I want to see your authority.”"
5430,STEAM TACTICS,
5431,STEAM TACTICS,“The badge of your ratin’?” Pyecroft added.
5432,STEAM TACTICS,
5433,STEAM TACTICS,"“I’m a constable,” he said, and kicked. Indeed, his boots would have"
5434,STEAM TACTICS,bewrayed him across half a county’s plough; but boots are not legal
5435,STEAM TACTICS,evidence.
5436,STEAM TACTICS,
5437,STEAM TACTICS,"“I want your authority,” I repeated coldly; “some evidence that you are"
5438,STEAM TACTICS,not a common drunken tramp.”
5439,STEAM TACTICS,
5440,STEAM TACTICS,It was as I had expected. He had forgotten or mislaid his badge. He had
5441,STEAM TACTICS,neglected to learn the outlines of the work for which he received money
5442,STEAM TACTICS,"and consideration; and he expected me, the tax-payer, to go to infinite"
5443,STEAM TACTICS,trouble to supplement his deficiencies.
5444,STEAM TACTICS,
5445,STEAM TACTICS,"“If you don’t believe me, come to Linghurst,” was the burden of his"
5446,STEAM TACTICS,almost national anthem.
5447,STEAM TACTICS,
5448,STEAM TACTICS,“But I can’t run all over Sussex every time a blackmailer jumps up and
5449,STEAM TACTICS,says he is a policeman.”
5450,STEAM TACTICS,
5451,STEAM TACTICS,"“Why, it’s quite close,” he persisted."
5452,STEAM TACTICS,
5453,STEAM TACTICS,"“’Twon’t be—soon,” said Hinchcliffe."
5454,STEAM TACTICS,
5455,STEAM TACTICS,"“None of the other people ever made any trouble. To be sure, _they_ was"
5456,STEAM TACTICS,"gentlemen,” he cried. “All I can say is, it may be very funny, but it"
5457,STEAM TACTICS,ain’t fair.”
5458,STEAM TACTICS,
5459,STEAM TACTICS,"I laboured with him in this dense fog, but to no end. He had forgotten"
5460,STEAM TACTICS,"his badge, and we were villains for that we did not cart him to the pub"
5461,STEAM TACTICS,or barracks where he had left it.
5462,STEAM TACTICS,
5463,STEAM TACTICS,Pyecroft listened critically as we spun along the hard road.
5464,STEAM TACTICS,
5465,STEAM TACTICS,"“If he was a concentrated Boer, he couldn’t expect much more,” he"
5466,STEAM TACTICS,"observed. “Now, suppose I’d been a lady in a delicate state o’"
5467,STEAM TACTICS,health—you’d ha’ made me very ill with your doings.”
5468,STEAM TACTICS,
5469,STEAM TACTICS,“I wish I ’ad. ’Ere! ’Elp! ’Elp! Hi!”
5470,STEAM TACTICS,
5471,STEAM TACTICS,"The man had seen a constable in uniform fifty yards ahead, where a lane"
5472,STEAM TACTICS,"ran into the road, and would have said more but that Hinchcliffe jerked"
5473,STEAM TACTICS,her up that lane with a wrench that nearly capsized us as the constable
5474,STEAM TACTICS,came running heavily.
5475,STEAM TACTICS,
5476,STEAM TACTICS,It seemed to me that both our guest and his fellow-villain in uniform
5477,STEAM TACTICS,smiled as we fled down the road easterly betwixt the narrowing hedges.
5478,STEAM TACTICS,
5479,STEAM TACTICS,"“You’ll know all about it in a little time,” said our guest. “You’ve"
5480,STEAM TACTICS,only yourselves to thank for runnin’ your ’ead into a trap.” And he
5481,STEAM TACTICS,whistled ostentatiously.
5482,STEAM TACTICS,
5483,STEAM TACTICS,We made no answer.
5484,STEAM TACTICS,
5485,STEAM TACTICS,"“If that man ’ad chose, ’e could have identified me,” he said."
5486,STEAM TACTICS,
5487,STEAM TACTICS,Still we were silent.
5488,STEAM TACTICS,
5489,STEAM TACTICS,"“But ’e’ll do it later, when you’re caught.”"
5490,STEAM TACTICS,
5491,STEAM TACTICS,"“Not if you go on talking. ’E won’t be able to,” said Pyecroft. “I"
5492,STEAM TACTICS,"don’t know what traverse you think you’re workin’, but your duty till"
5493,STEAM TACTICS,"you’re put in cells for a highway robber is to love, honour, an’"
5494,STEAM TACTICS,cherish _me_ most special—performin’ all evolutions signalled in rapid
5495,STEAM TACTICS,"time. I tell you this, in case o’ anything turnin’ up.”"
5496,STEAM TACTICS,
5497,STEAM TACTICS,"“Don’t you fret about things turnin’ up,” was the reply."
5498,STEAM TACTICS,
5499,STEAM TACTICS,"Hinchcliffe had given the car a generous throttle, and she was well set"
5500,STEAM TACTICS,"to work, when, without warning, the road—there are two or three in"
5501,STEAM TACTICS,Sussex like it—turned down and ceased.
5502,STEAM TACTICS,
5503,STEAM TACTICS,"“Holy Muckins!” he cried, and stood on both brakes as our helpless"
5504,STEAM TACTICS,tyres slithered over wet grass and bracken—down and down into
5505,STEAM TACTICS,"forest—early British woodland. It was the change of a nightmare, and"
5506,STEAM TACTICS,"that all should fit, fifty yards ahead of us a babbling brook barred"
5507,STEAM TACTICS,"our way. On the far side a velvet green ride, sprinkled with rabbits"
5508,STEAM TACTICS,"and fern, gently sloped upwards and away, but behind us was no hope."
5509,STEAM TACTICS,Forty horse-power would never have rolled wet pneumatic tyres up that
5510,STEAM TACTICS,verdurous cliff we had descended.
5511,STEAM TACTICS,
5512,STEAM TACTICS,“H’m!” Our guest coughed significantly. “A great many cars thinks they
5513,STEAM TACTICS,can take this road; but they all come back. We walks after ’em at our
5514,STEAM TACTICS,convenience.”
5515,STEAM TACTICS,
5516,STEAM TACTICS,“Meanin’ that the other jaunty is now pursuin’ us on his lily feet?”
5517,STEAM TACTICS,said Pyecroft.
5518,STEAM TACTICS,
5519,STEAM TACTICS,“_Pre_cisely.”
5520,STEAM TACTICS,
5521,STEAM TACTICS,"“An’ you think,” said Pyecroft (I have no hope to render the scorn of"
5522,STEAM TACTICS,"the words), “_that’ll_ make any odds? Get out!”"
5523,STEAM TACTICS,
5524,STEAM TACTICS,The man obeyed with alacrity.
5525,STEAM TACTICS,
5526,STEAM TACTICS,“See those spars up-ended over there? I mean that wickyup-thing.
5527,STEAM TACTICS,"Hop-poles, then, you rural blighter. Keep on fetching me hop-poles at"
5528,STEAM TACTICS,the double.”
5529,STEAM TACTICS,
5530,STEAM TACTICS,"And he doubled, Pyecroft at his heels; for they had arrived at a"
5531,STEAM TACTICS,perfect understanding.
5532,STEAM TACTICS,
5533,STEAM TACTICS,"There was a stack of hurdles a few yards down stream, laid aside after"
5534,STEAM TACTICS,sheep-washing; and there were stepping-stones in the brook. Hinchcliffe
5535,STEAM TACTICS,rearranged these last to make some sort of causeway; I brought up the
5536,STEAM TACTICS,hurdles; and when Pyecroft and his subaltern had dropped a dozen
5537,STEAM TACTICS,"hop-poles across the stream, laid them down over all."
5538,STEAM TACTICS,
5539,STEAM TACTICS,"“Talk o’ the Agricultur’l Hall!” he said, mopping his brow—“’tisn’t in"
5540,STEAM TACTICS,"it with us. The approach to the bridge must now be paved with hurdles,"
5541,STEAM TACTICS,"owin’ to the squashy nature o’ the country. Yes, an’ we’d better have"
5542,STEAM TACTICS,"one or two on the far side to lead her on to _terror fermior_. Now,"
5543,STEAM TACTICS,"Hinch! Give her full steam and ’op along. If she slips off, we’re done."
5544,STEAM TACTICS,Shall I take the wheel?”
5545,STEAM TACTICS,
5546,STEAM TACTICS,"“No. This is my job,” said the first-class engine-room artificer. “Get"
5547,STEAM TACTICS,"over the far side, and be ready to catch her if she jibs on the"
5548,STEAM TACTICS,uphill.”
5549,STEAM TACTICS,
5550,STEAM TACTICS,We crossed that elastic structure and stood ready amid the bracken.
5551,STEAM TACTICS,Hinchcliffe gave her a full steam and she came like a destroyer on her
5552,STEAM TACTICS,"trial. There was a crack, a flicker of white water, and she was in our"
5553,STEAM TACTICS,"arms fifty yards up the slope; or rather, we were behind her, pushing"
5554,STEAM TACTICS,her madly towards a patch of raw gravel whereon her wheels could bite.
5555,STEAM TACTICS,"Of the bridge remained only a few wildly vibrating hop-poles, and those"
5556,STEAM TACTICS,hurdles which had been sunk in the mud of the approaches.
5557,STEAM TACTICS,
5558,STEAM TACTICS,“She—she kicked out all the loose ones behind her as she finished with
5559,STEAM TACTICS,"’em,” Hinchcliffe panted."
5560,STEAM TACTICS,
5561,STEAM TACTICS,“At the Agricultural Hall they would ’ave been fastened down with
5562,STEAM TACTICS,"ribbons,” said Pyecroft. “But this ain’t Olympia.”"
5563,STEAM TACTICS,
5564,STEAM TACTICS,“She nearly wrenched the tiller out of my hand. Don’t you think I
5565,STEAM TACTICS,"conned her like a cock-angel, Pye?”"
5566,STEAM TACTICS,
5567,STEAM TACTICS,"“_I_ never saw anything like it,” said our guest propitiatingly. “And"
5568,STEAM TACTICS,"now, gentlemen, if you’ll let me go back to Linghurst, I promise you"
5569,STEAM TACTICS,you won’t hear another word from me.”
5570,STEAM TACTICS,
5571,STEAM TACTICS,"“Get in,” said Pyecroft, as we puffed out on to a metalled road once"
5572,STEAM TACTICS,more. “We ’aven’t begun on _you_ yet.”
5573,STEAM TACTICS,
5574,STEAM TACTICS,"“A joke’s a joke,” he replied. “I don’t mind a little bit of a joke"
5575,STEAM TACTICS,"myself, but this is going beyond it.”"
5576,STEAM TACTICS,
5577,STEAM TACTICS,"“Miles an’ miles beyond it, if this machine stands up. We’ll want water"
5578,STEAM TACTICS,pretty soon.”
5579,STEAM TACTICS,
5580,STEAM TACTICS,"Our guest’s countenance brightened, and Pyecroft perceived it."
5581,STEAM TACTICS,
5582,STEAM TACTICS,"“Let me tell you,” he said earnestly, “It won’t make any difference to"
5583,STEAM TACTICS,"you whatever happens. Barrin’ a dhow or two Tajurrah-way, prizes are"
5584,STEAM TACTICS,scarce in the Navy. Hence we never abandon ’em.”
5585,STEAM TACTICS,
5586,STEAM TACTICS,There was a long silence. Pyecroft broke it suddenly.
5587,STEAM TACTICS,
5588,STEAM TACTICS,"“Robert,” he said, “have you a mother?”"
5589,STEAM TACTICS,
5590,STEAM TACTICS,“Yes.”
5591,STEAM TACTICS,
5592,STEAM TACTICS,“Have you a big brother?”
5593,STEAM TACTICS,
5594,STEAM TACTICS,“Yes.”
5595,STEAM TACTICS,
5596,STEAM TACTICS,“An’ a little sister?”
5597,STEAM TACTICS,
5598,STEAM TACTICS,“Yes.”
5599,STEAM TACTICS,
5600,STEAM TACTICS,“Robert. Does your mamma keep a dog?”
5601,STEAM TACTICS,
5602,STEAM TACTICS,“Yes. Why?”
5603,STEAM TACTICS,
5604,STEAM TACTICS,"“All right, Robert. I won’t forget it.”"
5605,STEAM TACTICS,
5606,STEAM TACTICS,I looked for an explanation.
5607,STEAM TACTICS,
5608,STEAM TACTICS,“I saw his cabinet photograph in full uniform on the mantelpiece o’
5609,STEAM TACTICS,"that cottage before faithful Fido turned up,” Pyecroft whispered."
5610,STEAM TACTICS,“Ain’t you glad it’s all in the family somehow?”
5611,STEAM TACTICS,
5612,STEAM TACTICS,"We filled with water at a cottage on the edge of St. Leonard’s Forest,"
5613,STEAM TACTICS,"and, despite our increasing leakage, made shift to climb the ridge"
5614,STEAM TACTICS,"above Instead Wick. Knowing the car as I did, I felt sure that final"
5615,STEAM TACTICS,collapse would not be long delayed. My sole concern was to run our
5616,STEAM TACTICS,guest well into the wilderness before that came.
5617,STEAM TACTICS,
5618,STEAM TACTICS,On the roof of the world—a naked plateau clothed with young heather—she
5619,STEAM TACTICS,retired from active life in floods of tears. Her feed-water-heater
5620,STEAM TACTICS,(Hinchcliffe blessed it and its maker for three minutes) was leaking
5621,STEAM TACTICS,"beyond hope of repair; she had shifted most of her packing, and her"
5622,STEAM TACTICS,water-pump would not lift.
5623,STEAM TACTICS,
5624,STEAM TACTICS,“If I had a bit of piping I could disconnect this tin cartridge-case
5625,STEAM TACTICS,"an’ feed direct into the boiler. It ’ud knock down her speed, but we"
5626,STEAM TACTICS,"could get on,” said he, and looked hopelessly at the long dun ridges"
5627,STEAM TACTICS,that hove us above the panorama of Sussex. Northward we could see the
5628,STEAM TACTICS,"London haze. Southward, between gaps of the whale-backed Downs, lay the"
5629,STEAM TACTICS,Channel’s zinc-blue. But all our available population in that vast
5630,STEAM TACTICS,survey was one cow and a kestrel.
5631,STEAM TACTICS,
5632,STEAM TACTICS,"“It’s down hill to Instead Wick. We can run her there by gravity,” I"
5633,STEAM TACTICS,said at last.
5634,STEAM TACTICS,
5635,STEAM TACTICS,“Then he’ll only have to walk to the station to get home. Unless we
5636,STEAM TACTICS,"take off ’is boots first,” Pyecroft replied."
5637,STEAM TACTICS,
5638,STEAM TACTICS,"“That,” said our guest earnestly, “would be theft atop of assault and"
5639,STEAM TACTICS,very serious.”
5640,STEAM TACTICS,
5641,STEAM TACTICS,"“Oh, let’s hang him an’ be done,” Hinchcliffe grunted. “It’s evidently"
5642,STEAM TACTICS,what he’s sufferin’ for.”
5643,STEAM TACTICS,
5644,STEAM TACTICS,Somehow murder did not appeal to us that warm noon. We sat down to
5645,STEAM TACTICS,"smoke in the heather, and presently out of the valley below came the"
5646,STEAM TACTICS,thick beat of a petrol-motor ascending. I paid little attention to it
5647,STEAM TACTICS,till I heard the roar of a horn that has no duplicate in all the Home
5648,STEAM TACTICS,Counties.
5649,STEAM TACTICS,
5650,STEAM TACTICS,“That’s the man I was going to lunch with!” I cried. “Hold on!” and I
5651,STEAM TACTICS,ran down the road.
5652,STEAM TACTICS,
5653,STEAM TACTICS,"It was a big, black, black-dashed, tonneaued twenty-four horse Octopod;"
5654,STEAM TACTICS,"and it bore not only Kysh my friend, and Salmon his engineer, but my"
5655,STEAM TACTICS,"own man, who for the first time in our acquaintance smiled."
5656,STEAM TACTICS,
5657,STEAM TACTICS,“Did they get you? What did you get? I was coming into Linghurst as
5658,STEAM TACTICS,witness to character—your man told me what happened—but I was stopped
5659,STEAM TACTICS,"near Instead Wick myself,” cried Kysh."
5660,STEAM TACTICS,
5661,STEAM TACTICS,“What for?”
5662,STEAM TACTICS,
5663,STEAM TACTICS,"“Leaving car unattended. An infernal swindle, when you think of the"
5664,STEAM TACTICS,loose carts outside every pub in the county. I was jawing with the
5665,STEAM TACTICS,"police for an hour, but it’s no use. They’ve got it all their own way,"
5666,STEAM TACTICS,and we’re helpless.”
5667,STEAM TACTICS,
5668,STEAM TACTICS,"Hereupon I told him my tale, and for proof, as we topped the hill,"
5669,STEAM TACTICS,pointed out the little group round my car.
5670,STEAM TACTICS,
5671,STEAM TACTICS,All supreme emotion is dumb. Kysh put on the brake and hugged me to his
5672,STEAM TACTICS,"bosom till I groaned. Then, as I remember, he crooned like a mother"
5673,STEAM TACTICS,returned to her suckling.
5674,STEAM TACTICS,
5675,STEAM TACTICS,“Divine! Divine!” he murmured. “Command me.”
5676,STEAM TACTICS,
5677,STEAM TACTICS,"“Take charge of the situation,” I said. “You’ll find a Mr. Pyecroft on"
5678,STEAM TACTICS,the quarter-deck. I’m altogether out of it.”
5679,STEAM TACTICS,
5680,STEAM TACTICS,“He shall stay there. Who am I but the instrument of vengeance in the
5681,STEAM TACTICS,hands of an over-ruling Providence? (And I put in fresh sparking-plugs
5682,STEAM TACTICS,"this morning.) Salmon, take that steam-kettle home, somehow. I would be"
5683,STEAM TACTICS,alone.”
5684,STEAM TACTICS,
5685,STEAM TACTICS,"“Leggat,” I said to my man, “help Salmon home with my car.”"
5686,STEAM TACTICS,
5687,STEAM TACTICS,"“Home? Now? It’s hard. It’s cruel hard,” said Leggat, almost with a"
5688,STEAM TACTICS,sob.
5689,STEAM TACTICS,
5690,STEAM TACTICS,Hinchcliffe outlined my car’s condition briefly to the two engineers.
5691,STEAM TACTICS,"Mr. Pyecroft clung to our guest, who stared with affrighted eyes at the"
5692,STEAM TACTICS,palpitating Octopod; and the free wind of high Sussex whimpered across
5693,STEAM TACTICS,the ling.
5694,STEAM TACTICS,
5695,STEAM TACTICS,"“I am quite agreeable to walkin’ ’ome all the way on my feet,” said our"
5696,STEAM TACTICS,guest. “I wouldn’t go to any railway station. It ’ud be just the proper
5697,STEAM TACTICS,finish to our little joke.” He laughed nervously.
5698,STEAM TACTICS,
5699,STEAM TACTICS,“What’s the evolution?” said Pyecroft. “Do we turn over to the new
5700,STEAM TACTICS,cruiser?”
5701,STEAM TACTICS,
5702,STEAM TACTICS,"I nodded, and he escorted our guest to the tonneau with care. When I"
5703,STEAM TACTICS,"was in, he sat himself broad-armed on the little flap-seat which"
5704,STEAM TACTICS,controls the door. Hinchcliffe sat by Kysh.
5705,STEAM TACTICS,
5706,STEAM TACTICS,"“You drive?” Kysh asked, with the smile that has won him his chequered"
5707,STEAM TACTICS,way through the world.
5708,STEAM TACTICS,
5709,STEAM TACTICS,"“Steam only, and I’ve about had my whack for to-day, thanks.”"
5710,STEAM TACTICS,
5711,STEAM TACTICS,“I see.”
5712,STEAM TACTICS,
5713,STEAM TACTICS,"The long, low car slid forward and then dropped like a bullet down the"
5714,STEAM TACTICS,descent our steam toy had so painfully climbed. Our guest’s face
5715,STEAM TACTICS,"blanched, and he clutched the back of the tonneau."
5716,STEAM TACTICS,
5717,STEAM TACTICS,"“New commander’s evidently been trained on a destroyer,” said"
5718,STEAM TACTICS,Hinchcliffe.
5719,STEAM TACTICS,
5720,STEAM TACTICS,"“What’s ’is wonderful name?” whispered Pyecroft. “Ho! Well, I’m glad it"
5721,STEAM TACTICS,"ain’t Saul we’ve run up against—nor Nimshi, for that matter. This is"
5722,STEAM TACTICS,makin’ me feel religious.”
5723,STEAM TACTICS,
5724,STEAM TACTICS,"Our impetus carried us half-way up the next slope, where we steadied to"
5725,STEAM TACTICS,a resonant fifteen an hour against the collar.
5726,STEAM TACTICS,
5727,STEAM TACTICS,“What do you think?” I called to Hinchcliffe.
5728,STEAM TACTICS,
5729,STEAM TACTICS,"“’Taint as sweet as steam, o’ course; but for power it’s twice the"
5730,STEAM TACTICS,_Furious_ against half the _Jaseur_ in a head-sea.”
5731,STEAM TACTICS,
5732,STEAM TACTICS,Volumes could not have touched it more exactly. His bright eyes were
5733,STEAM TACTICS,glued on Kysh’s hands juggling with levers behind the discreet backward
5734,STEAM TACTICS,sloping dash.
5735,STEAM TACTICS,
5736,STEAM TACTICS,“An’ what sort of a brake might you use?” he said politely.
5737,STEAM TACTICS,
5738,STEAM TACTICS,"“This,” Kysh replied, as the last of the hill shot up to one in eight."
5739,STEAM TACTICS,"He let the car run back a few feet and caught her deftly on the brake,"
5740,STEAM TACTICS,repeating the performance cup and ball fashion. It was like being daped
5741,STEAM TACTICS,above the Pit at the end of an uncoiled solar plexus. Even Pyecroft
5742,STEAM TACTICS,held his breath.
5743,STEAM TACTICS,
5744,STEAM TACTICS,“It ain’t fair! It ain’t fair!” our guest moaned. “You’re makin’ me
5745,STEAM TACTICS,sick.”
5746,STEAM TACTICS,
5747,STEAM TACTICS,“What an ungrateful blighter he is!” said Pyecroft. “Money couldn’t buy
5748,STEAM TACTICS,you a run like this … Do it well overboard!”
5749,STEAM TACTICS,
5750,STEAM TACTICS,"“We’ll just trundle up the Forest and drop into the Park Row, I think,”"
5751,STEAM TACTICS,said Kysh. “There’s a bit of good going hereabouts.”
5752,STEAM TACTICS,
5753,STEAM TACTICS,He flung a careless knee over the low raking tiller that the ordinary
5754,STEAM TACTICS,"expert puts under his armpit, and down four miles of yellow road, cut"
5755,STEAM TACTICS,"through barren waste, the Octopod sang like a six-inch shell."
5756,STEAM TACTICS,
5757,STEAM TACTICS,"“Whew! But you know your job,” said Hinchcliffe. “You’re wasted here."
5758,STEAM TACTICS,I’d give something to have you in my engine-room.”
5759,STEAM TACTICS,
5760,STEAM TACTICS,"“He’s steering with ’is little hind-legs,” said Pyecroft. “Stand up and"
5761,STEAM TACTICS,"look at him, Robert. You’ll never see such a sight again!”"
5762,STEAM TACTICS,
5763,STEAM TACTICS,"“Nor don’t want to,” was our guest’s reply. “Five ’undred pounds"
5764,STEAM TACTICS,wouldn’t begin to cover ’is fines even since I’ve been with him.”
5765,STEAM TACTICS,
5766,STEAM TACTICS,Park Row is reached by one hill which drops three hundred feet in half
5767,STEAM TACTICS,"a mile. Kysh had the thought to steer with his hand down the abyss, but"
5768,STEAM TACTICS,the manner in which he took the curved bridge at the bottom brought my
5769,STEAM TACTICS,few remaining hairs much nearer the grave.
5770,STEAM TACTICS,
5771,STEAM TACTICS,"“We’re in Surrey now; better look out,” I said."
5772,STEAM TACTICS,
5773,STEAM TACTICS,“Never mind. I’ll roll her into Kent for a bit. We’ve lots of time;
5774,STEAM TACTICS,it’s only three o’clock.”
5775,STEAM TACTICS,
5776,STEAM TACTICS,"“Won’t you want to fill your bunkers, or take water, or oil her up?”"
5777,STEAM TACTICS,said Hinchcliffe.
5778,STEAM TACTICS,
5779,STEAM TACTICS,"“We don’t use water, and she’s good for two hundred on one tank o’"
5780,STEAM TACTICS,petrol if she doesn’t break down.”
5781,STEAM TACTICS,
5782,STEAM TACTICS,"“Two hundred miles from ’ome and mother _and_ faithful Fido to-night,"
5783,STEAM TACTICS,"Robert,” said Pyecroft, slapping our guest on the knee. “Cheer up! Why,"
5784,STEAM TACTICS,I’ve known a destroyer do less.”
5785,STEAM TACTICS,
5786,STEAM TACTICS,"We passed with some decency through some towns, till by way of the"
5787,STEAM TACTICS,"Hastings road we whirled into Cramberhurst, which is a deep pit."
5788,STEAM TACTICS,
5789,STEAM TACTICS,"“Now,” said Kysh, “we begin.”"
5790,STEAM TACTICS,
5791,STEAM TACTICS,"“Previous service not reckoned towards pension,” said Pyecroft. “We are"
5792,STEAM TACTICS,"doin’ you lavish, Robert.”"
5793,STEAM TACTICS,
5794,STEAM TACTICS,"“But when’s this silly game to finish, any’ow?” our guest snarled."
5795,STEAM TACTICS,
5796,STEAM TACTICS,"“Don’t worry about the _when_ of it, Robert. The _where’s_ the"
5797,STEAM TACTICS,interestin’ point for you just now.”
5798,STEAM TACTICS,
5799,STEAM TACTICS,"I had seen Kysh drive before, and I thought I knew the Octopod, but"
5800,STEAM TACTICS,that afternoon he and she were exalted beyond my knowledge. He
5801,STEAM TACTICS,improvised on the keys—the snapping levers and quivering
5802,STEAM TACTICS,"accelerators—marvellous variations, so that our progress was sometimes"
5803,STEAM TACTICS,"a fugue and sometimes a barn-dance, varied on open greens by the"
5804,STEAM TACTICS,"weaving of fairy rings. When I protested, all that he would say was:"
5805,STEAM TACTICS,“I’ll hypnotise the fowl! I’ll dazzle the rooster!” or other words
5806,STEAM TACTICS,equally futile. And she—oh! that I could do her justice!—she turned her
5807,STEAM TACTICS,"broad black bows to the westering light, and lifted us high upon hills"
5808,STEAM TACTICS,that we might see and rejoice with her. She whooped into veiled hollows
5809,STEAM TACTICS,of elm and Sussex oak; she devoured infinite perspectives of park
5810,STEAM TACTICS,"palings; she surged through forgotten hamlets, whose single streets"
5811,STEAM TACTICS,"gave back, reduplicated, the clatter of her exhaust, and, tireless, she"
5812,STEAM TACTICS,"repeated the motions. Over naked uplands she droned like a homing bee,"
5813,STEAM TACTICS,her shadow lengthening in the sun that she chased to his lair. She
5814,STEAM TACTICS,nosed up unparochial byways and accommodation-roads of the least
5815,STEAM TACTICS,"accommodation, and put old scarred turf or new-raised molehills under"
5816,STEAM TACTICS,her most marvellous springs with never a jar. And since the King’s
5817,STEAM TACTICS,"highway is used for every purpose save traffic, in mid-career she"
5818,STEAM TACTICS,"stepped aside for, or flung amazing loops about, the brainless driver,"
5819,STEAM TACTICS,"the driverless horse, the drunken carrier, the engaged couple, the"
5820,STEAM TACTICS,"female student of the bicycle and her staggering instructor, the pig,"
5821,STEAM TACTICS,"the perambulator, and the infant school (where it disembogued yelping"
5822,STEAM TACTICS,"on cross-roads), with the grace of Nellie Farren (upon whom be the"
5823,STEAM TACTICS,Peace) and the lithe abandon of all the Vokes family. But at heart she
5824,STEAM TACTICS,was ever Judic as I remember that Judic long ago—Judic clad in
5825,STEAM TACTICS,"bourgeois black from wrist to ankle, achieving incredible"
5826,STEAM TACTICS,improprieties.
5827,STEAM TACTICS,
5828,STEAM TACTICS,We were silent—Hinchcliffe and Pyecroft through professional
5829,STEAM TACTICS,appreciation; I with a layman’s delight in the expert; and our guest
5830,STEAM TACTICS,because of fear.
5831,STEAM TACTICS,
5832,STEAM TACTICS,At the edge of the evening she smelt the sea to southward and sheered
5833,STEAM TACTICS,"thither like the strong-winged albatross, to circle enormously amid"
5834,STEAM TACTICS,green flats fringed by martello towers.
5835,STEAM TACTICS,
5836,STEAM TACTICS,"“Ain’t that Eastbourne yonder?” said our guest, reviving. “I’ve a aunt"
5837,STEAM TACTICS,there—she’s cook to a J.P.—could identify me.”
5838,STEAM TACTICS,
5839,STEAM TACTICS,"“Don’t worry her for a little thing like that,” said Pyecroft; and ere"
5840,STEAM TACTICS,"he had ceased to praise family love, our unpaid judiciary, and domestic"
5841,STEAM TACTICS,"service, the Downs rose between us and the sea, and the Long Man of"
5842,STEAM TACTICS,Hillingdon lay out upon the turf.
5843,STEAM TACTICS,
5844,STEAM TACTICS,"“Trevington—up yonder—is a fairly isolated little dorp,” I said, for I"
5845,STEAM TACTICS,was beginning to feel hungry.
5846,STEAM TACTICS,
5847,STEAM TACTICS,"“No,” said Kysh. “He’d get a lift to the railway in no time…. Besides,"
5848,STEAM TACTICS,I’m enjoying myself…. Three pounds eighteen and sixpence. Infernal
5849,STEAM TACTICS,swindle!”
5850,STEAM TACTICS,
5851,STEAM TACTICS,I take it one of his more recent fines was rankling in Kysh’s brain;
5852,STEAM TACTICS,but he drove like the Archangel of the Twilight.
5853,STEAM TACTICS,
5854,STEAM TACTICS,"About the longitude of Cassocks, Hinchcliffe yawned. “Aren’t we goin’"
5855,STEAM TACTICS,"to maroon our Robert? I’m hungry, too.”"
5856,STEAM TACTICS,
5857,STEAM TACTICS,"“The commodore wants his money back,” I answered."
5858,STEAM TACTICS,
5859,STEAM TACTICS,"“If he drives like this habitual, there must be a tidyish little lump"
5860,STEAM TACTICS,"owin’ to him,” said Pyecroft. “Well, I’m agreeable.”"
5861,STEAM TACTICS,
5862,STEAM TACTICS,"“I didn’t know it could be done. S’welp me, I didn’t,” our guest"
5863,STEAM TACTICS,murmured.
5864,STEAM TACTICS,
5865,STEAM TACTICS,"“But you will,” said Kysh. And that was the first and last time he"
5866,STEAM TACTICS,addressed the man.
5867,STEAM TACTICS,
5868,STEAM TACTICS,"We ran through Penfield Green, half stupefied with open air, drugged"
5869,STEAM TACTICS,"with the relentless boom of the Octopod, and extinct with famine."
5870,STEAM TACTICS,
5871,STEAM TACTICS,"“I used to shoot about here,” said Kysh, a few miles further on. “Open"
5872,STEAM TACTICS,"that gate, please,” and he slowed as the sun touched the sky-line. At"
5873,STEAM TACTICS,this point we left metalled roads and bucked vigorously amid ditches
5874,STEAM TACTICS,and under trees for twenty minutes.
5875,STEAM TACTICS,
5876,STEAM TACTICS,"“Only cross-country car on the market,” he said, as we wheeled into a"
5877,STEAM TACTICS,straw-yard where a lone bull bellowed defiance to our growlings. “Open
5878,STEAM TACTICS,"that gate, please. I hope the cattle-bridge will stand up.”"
5879,STEAM TACTICS,
5880,STEAM TACTICS,"“I’ve took a few risks in my time,” said Pyecroft as timbers cracked"
5881,STEAM TACTICS,"beneath us and we entered between thickets, “but I’m a babe to this"
5882,STEAM TACTICS,"man, Hinch.”"
5883,STEAM TACTICS,
5884,STEAM TACTICS,"“Don’t talk to me. Watch _him!_ It’s a liberal education, as"
5885,STEAM TACTICS,"Shakespeare says. Fallen tree on the port bow, Sir.”"
5886,STEAM TACTICS,
5887,STEAM TACTICS,“Right! That’s my mark. Sit tight!”
5888,STEAM TACTICS,
5889,STEAM TACTICS,She flung up her tail like a sounding whale and buried us in a
5890,STEAM TACTICS,fifteen-foot deep bridle-path buttressed with the exposed roots of
5891,STEAM TACTICS,"enormous beeches. The wheels leaped from root to rounded boulder, and"
5892,STEAM TACTICS,it was very dark in the shadow of the foliage.
5893,STEAM TACTICS,
5894,STEAM TACTICS,“There ought to be a hammer-pond somewhere about here.” Kysh was
5895,STEAM TACTICS,letting her down this chute in brakeful spasms.
5896,STEAM TACTICS,
5897,STEAM TACTICS,"“Water dead ahead, Sir. Stack o’ brushwood on the starboard beam,"
5898,STEAM TACTICS,"and—no road,” sang Pyecroft."
5899,STEAM TACTICS,
5900,STEAM TACTICS,"“Cr-r-ri-key!” said Hinchcliffe, as the car on a wild cant to the left"
5901,STEAM TACTICS,"went astern, screwing herself round the angle of a track that overhung"
5902,STEAM TACTICS,"the pond. “If she only had two propellers, I believe she’d talk poetry."
5903,STEAM TACTICS,She can do everything else.”
5904,STEAM TACTICS,
5905,STEAM TACTICS,"“We’re rather on our port wheels now,” said Kysh; “but I don’t think"
5906,STEAM TACTICS,she’ll capsize. This road isn’t used much by motors.”
5907,STEAM TACTICS,
5908,STEAM TACTICS,"“You don’t say so,” said Pyecroft. “What a pity!”"
5909,STEAM TACTICS,
5910,STEAM TACTICS,"She bored through a mass of crackling brushwood, and emerged into an"
5911,STEAM TACTICS,"upward sloping fern-glade fenced with woods so virgin, so untouched,"
5912,STEAM TACTICS,that William Rufus might have ridden off as we entered. We climbed out
5913,STEAM TACTICS,of the violet-purple shadows towards the upland where the last of the
5914,STEAM TACTICS,day lingered. I was filled to my moist eyes with the almost sacred
5915,STEAM TACTICS,beauty of sense and association that clad the landscape.
5916,STEAM TACTICS,
5917,STEAM TACTICS,“Does ’unger produce ’alluciations?” said Pyecroft in a whisper.
5918,STEAM TACTICS,“Because I’ve just seen a sacred ibis walkin’ arm in arm with a British
5919,STEAM TACTICS,cock-pheasant.”
5920,STEAM TACTICS,
5921,STEAM TACTICS,“What are you panickin’ at?” said Hinchcliffe. “I’ve been seein’ zebra
5922,STEAM TACTICS,"for the last two minutes, but I ’aven’t complained.”"
5923,STEAM TACTICS,
5924,STEAM TACTICS,"He pointed behind us, and I beheld a superb painted zebra (Burchell’s,"
5925,STEAM TACTICS,"I think), following our track with palpitating nostrils. The car"
5926,STEAM TACTICS,"stopped, and it fled away."
5927,STEAM TACTICS,
5928,STEAM TACTICS,There was a little pond in front of us from which rose a dome of
5929,STEAM TACTICS,irregular sticks crowned with a blunt-muzzled beast that sat upon its
5930,STEAM TACTICS,haunches.
5931,STEAM TACTICS,
5932,STEAM TACTICS,“Is it catching?” said Pyecroft.
5933,STEAM TACTICS,
5934,STEAM TACTICS,"“Yes. I’m seeing beaver,” I replied."
5935,STEAM TACTICS,
5936,STEAM TACTICS,"“It is here!” said Kysh, with the air and gesture of Captain Nemo, and"
5937,STEAM TACTICS,half turned.
5938,STEAM TACTICS,
5939,STEAM TACTICS,“No—no—no! For ’Eaven’s sake—not ’ere!” Our guest gasped like a
5940,STEAM TACTICS,"sea-bathed child, as four efficient hands swung him far out-board on to"
5941,STEAM TACTICS,the turf. The car ran back noiselessly down the slope.
5942,STEAM TACTICS,
5943,STEAM TACTICS,“Look! Look! It’s sorcery!” cried Hinchcliffe.
5944,STEAM TACTICS,
5945,STEAM TACTICS,There was a report like a pistol shot as the beaver dived from the roof
5946,STEAM TACTICS,"of his lodge, but we watched our guest. He was on his knees, praying to"
5947,STEAM TACTICS,"kangaroos. Yea, in his bowler hat he kneeled before kangaroos—gigantic,"
5948,STEAM TACTICS,"erect, silhouetted against the light—four buck-kangaroos in the heart"
5949,STEAM TACTICS,of Sussex!
5950,STEAM TACTICS,
5951,STEAM TACTICS,And we retrogressed over the velvet grass till our hind-wheels struck
5952,STEAM TACTICS,"well-rolled gravel, leading us to sanity, main roads, and, half an hour"
5953,STEAM TACTICS,"later, the “Grapnel Inn” at Horsham."
5954,STEAM TACTICS,
5955,STEAM TACTICS,
5956,STEAM TACTICS,After a great meal we poured libations and made burnt-offerings in
5957,STEAM TACTICS,"honour of Kysh, who received our homage graciously, and, by the way,"
5958,STEAM TACTICS,explained a few things in the natural history line that had puzzled us.
5959,STEAM TACTICS,"England is a most marvellous country, but one is not, till one knows"
5960,STEAM TACTICS,"the eccentricities of large land-owners, trained to accept kangaroos,"
5961,STEAM TACTICS,"zebras, or beavers as part of its landscape."
5962,STEAM TACTICS,
5963,STEAM TACTICS,"When we went to bed Pyecroft pressed my hand, his voice thick with"
5964,STEAM TACTICS,emotion.
5965,STEAM TACTICS,
5966,STEAM TACTICS,"“We owe it to you,” he said. “We owe it all to you. Didn’t I say we"
5967,STEAM TACTICS,"never met in _pup-pup-puris naturalibus_, if I may so put it, without a"
5968,STEAM TACTICS,remarkably hectic day ahead of us?”
5969,STEAM TACTICS,
5970,STEAM TACTICS,"“That’s all right,” I said. “Mind the candle.” He was tracing"

6024,“WIRELESS”,
6025,“WIRELESS”,"“It’s a funny thing, this Marconi business, isn’t it?” said Mr."
6026,“WIRELESS”,"Shaynor, coughing heavily. “Nothing seems to make any difference, by"
6027,“WIRELESS”,"what they tell me—storms, hills, or anything; but if that’s true we"
6028,“WIRELESS”,shall know before morning.”
6029,“WIRELESS”,
6030,“WIRELESS”,"“Of course it’s true,” I answered, stepping behind the counter."
6031,“WIRELESS”,“Where’s old Mr. Cashell?”
6032,“WIRELESS”,
6033,“WIRELESS”,“He’s had to go to bed on account of his influenza. He said you’d very
6034,“WIRELESS”,likely drop in.”
6035,“WIRELESS”,
6036,“WIRELESS”,“Where’s his nephew?”
6037,“WIRELESS”,
6038,“WIRELESS”,"“Inside, getting the things ready. He told me that the last time they"
6039,“WIRELESS”,experimented they put the pole on the roof of one of the big hotels
6040,“WIRELESS”,"here, and the batteries electrified all the water-supply, and”—he"
6041,“WIRELESS”,giggled—“the ladies got shocks when they took their baths.”
6042,“WIRELESS”,
6043,“WIRELESS”,“I never heard of that.”
6044,“WIRELESS”,
6045,“WIRELESS”,"“The hotel wouldn’t exactly advertise it, would it? Just now, by what"
6046,“WIRELESS”,"Mr. Cashell tells me, they’re trying to signal from here to Poole, and"
6047,“WIRELESS”,"they’re using stronger batteries than ever. But, you see, he being the"
6048,“WIRELESS”,"guvnor’s nephew and all that (and it will be in the papers too), it"
6049,“WIRELESS”,doesn’t matter how they electrify things in this house. Are you going
6050,“WIRELESS”,to watch?”
6051,“WIRELESS”,
6052,“WIRELESS”,“Very much. I’ve never seen this game. Aren’t you going to bed?”
6053,“WIRELESS”,
6054,“WIRELESS”,“We don’t close till ten on Saturdays. There’s a good deal of influenza
6055,“WIRELESS”,"in town, too, and there’ll be a dozen prescriptions coming in before"
6056,“WIRELESS”,morning. I generally sleep in the chair here. It’s warmer than jumping
6057,“WIRELESS”,"out of bed every time. Bitter cold, isn’t it?”"
6058,“WIRELESS”,
6059,“WIRELESS”,“Freezing hard. I’m sorry your cough’s worse.”
6060,“WIRELESS”,
6061,“WIRELESS”,“Thank you. I don’t mind cold so much. It’s this wind that fair cuts me
6062,“WIRELESS”,"to pieces.” He coughed again hard and hackingly, as an old lady came in"
6063,“WIRELESS”,"for ammoniated quinine. “We’ve just run out of it in bottles, madam,”"
6064,“WIRELESS”,"said Mr. Shaynor, returning to the professional tone, “but if you will"
6065,“WIRELESS”,"wait two minutes, I’ll make it up for you, madam.”"
6066,“WIRELESS”,
6067,“WIRELESS”,"I had used the shop for some time, and my acquaintance with the"
6068,“WIRELESS”,proprietor had ripened into friendship. It was Mr. Cashell who revealed
6069,“WIRELESS”,to me the purpose and power of Apothecaries’ Hall what time a
6070,“WIRELESS”,"fellow-chemist had made an error in a prescription of mine, had lied to"
6071,“WIRELESS”,"cover his sloth, and when error and lie were brought home to him had"
6072,“WIRELESS”,written vain letters.
6073,“WIRELESS”,
6074,“WIRELESS”,"“A disgrace to our profession,” said the thin, mild-eyed man, hotly,"
6075,“WIRELESS”,after studying the evidence. “You couldn’t do a better service to the
6076,“WIRELESS”,profession than report him to Apothecaries’ Hall.”
6077,“WIRELESS”,
6078,“WIRELESS”,"I did so, not knowing what djinns I should evoke; and the result was"
6079,“WIRELESS”,such an apology as one might make who had spent a night on the rack. I
6080,“WIRELESS”,"conceived great respect for Apothecaries’ Hall, and esteem for Mr."
6081,“WIRELESS”,"Cashell, a zealous craftsman who magnified his calling. Until Mr."
6082,“WIRELESS”,Shaynor came down from the North his assistants had by no means agreed
6083,“WIRELESS”,"with Mr. Cashell. “They forget,” said he, “that, first and foremost,"
6084,“WIRELESS”,the compounder is a medicine-man. On him depends the physician’s
6085,“WIRELESS”,"reputation. He holds it literally in the hollow of his hand, Sir.”"
6086,“WIRELESS”,
6087,“WIRELESS”,"Mr. Shaynor’s manners had not, perhaps, the polish of the grocery and"
6088,“WIRELESS”,"Italian warehouse next door, but he knew and loved his dispensary work"
6089,“WIRELESS”,in every detail. For relaxation he seemed to go no farther afield than
6090,“WIRELESS”,"the romance of drugs—their discovery, preparation packing, and"
6091,“WIRELESS”,"export—but it led him to the ends of the earth, and on this subject,"
6092,“WIRELESS”,"and the Pharmaceutical Formulary, and Nicholas Culpepper, most"
6093,“WIRELESS”,"confident of physicians, we met."
6094,“WIRELESS”,
6095,“WIRELESS”,Little by little I grew to know something of his beginnings and his
6096,“WIRELESS”,"hopes—of his mother, who had been a school-teacher in one of the"
6097,“WIRELESS”,"northern counties, and of his red-headed father, a small job-master at"
6098,“WIRELESS”,"Kirby Moors, who died when he was a child; of the examinations he had"
6099,“WIRELESS”,passed and of their exceeding and increasing difficulty; of his dreams
6100,“WIRELESS”,of a shop in London; of his hate for the price-cutting Co-operative
6101,“WIRELESS”,"stores; and, most interesting, of his mental attitude towards"
6102,“WIRELESS”,customers.
6103,“WIRELESS”,
6104,“WIRELESS”,"“There’s a way you get into,” he told me, “of serving them carefully,"
6105,“WIRELESS”,"and I hope, politely, without stopping your own thinking. I’ve been"
6106,“WIRELESS”,"reading Christie’s _New Commercial Plants_ all this autumn, and that"
6107,“WIRELESS”,"needs keeping your mind on it, I can tell you. So long as it isn’t a"
6108,“WIRELESS”,"prescription, of course, I can carry as much as half a page of Christie"
6109,“WIRELESS”,"in my head, and at the same time I could sell out all that window twice"
6110,“WIRELESS”,"over, and not a penny wrong at the end. As to prescriptions, I think I"
6111,“WIRELESS”,"could make up the general run of ’em in my sleep, almost.”"
6112,“WIRELESS”,
6113,“WIRELESS”,"For reasons of my own, I was deeply interested in Marconi experiments"
6114,“WIRELESS”,at their outset in England; and it was of a piece with Mr. Cashell’s
6115,“WIRELESS”,"unvarying thoughtfulness that, when his nephew the electrician"
6116,“WIRELESS”,"appropriated the house for a long-range installation, he should, as I"
6117,“WIRELESS”,"have said, invite me to see the result."
6118,“WIRELESS”,
6119,“WIRELESS”,"The old lady went away with her medicine, and Mr. Shaynor and I stamped"
6120,“WIRELESS”,"on the tiled floor behind the counter to keep ourselves warm. The shop,"
6121,“WIRELESS”,"by the light of the many electrics, looked like a Paris-diamond mine,"
6122,“WIRELESS”,for Mr. Cashell believed in all the ritual of his craft. Three superb
6123,“WIRELESS”,"glass jars—red, green, and blue—of the sort that led Rosamund to"
6124,“WIRELESS”,"parting with her shoes—blazed in the broad plate-glass windows, and"
6125,“WIRELESS”,"there was a confused smell of orris, Kodak films, vulcanite,"
6126,“WIRELESS”,"tooth-powder, sachets, and almond-cream in the air. Mr. Shaynor fed the"
6127,“WIRELESS”,"dispensary stove, and we sucked cayenne-pepper jujubes and menthol"
6128,“WIRELESS”,"lozenges. The brutal east wind had cleared the streets, and the few"
6129,“WIRELESS”,passers-by were muffled to their puckered eyes. In the Italian
6130,“WIRELESS”,"warehouse next door some gay feathered birds and game, hung upon hooks,"
6131,“WIRELESS”,sagged to the wind across the left edge of our window-frame.
6132,“WIRELESS”,
6133,“WIRELESS”,"“They ought to take these poultry in—all knocked about like that,” said"
6134,“WIRELESS”,Mr. Shaynor. “Doesn’t it make you feel fair perishing? See that old
6135,“WIRELESS”,hare! The wind’s nearly blowing the fur off him.”
6136,“WIRELESS”,
6137,“WIRELESS”,I saw the belly-fur of the dead beast blown apart in ridges and streaks
6138,“WIRELESS”,"as the wind caught it, showing bluish skin underneath. “Bitter cold,”"
6139,“WIRELESS”,"said Mr. Shaynor, shuddering. “Fancy going out on a night like this!"
6140,“WIRELESS”,"Oh, here’s young Mr. Cashell.”"
6141,“WIRELESS”,
6142,“WIRELESS”,"The door of the inner office behind the dispensary opened, and an"
6143,“WIRELESS”,"energetic, spade-bearded man stepped forth, rubbing his hands."
6144,“WIRELESS”,
6145,“WIRELESS”,"“I want a bit of tin-foil, Shaynor,” he said. “Good-evening. My uncle"
6146,“WIRELESS”,"told me you might be coming.” This to me, as I began the first of a"
6147,“WIRELESS”,hundred questions.
6148,“WIRELESS”,
6149,“WIRELESS”,"“I’ve everything in order,” he replied. “We’re only waiting until Poole"
6150,“WIRELESS”,calls us up. Excuse me a minute. You can come in whenever you like—but
6151,“WIRELESS”,I’d better be with the instruments. Give me that tin-foil. Thanks.”
6152,“WIRELESS”,
6153,“WIRELESS”,"While we were talking, a girl—evidently no customer—had come into the"
6154,“WIRELESS”,"shop, and the face and bearing of Mr. Shaynor changed. She leaned"
6155,“WIRELESS”,confidently across the counter.
6156,“WIRELESS”,
6157,“WIRELESS”,"“But I can’t,” I heard him whisper uneasily—the flush on his cheek was"
6158,“WIRELESS”,"dull red, and his eyes shone like a drugged moth’s. “I can’t. I tell"
6159,“WIRELESS”,you I’m alone in the place.”
6160,“WIRELESS”,
6161,“WIRELESS”,"“No, you aren’t. Who’s _that_? Let him look after it for half an hour."
6162,“WIRELESS”,"A brisk walk will do you good. Ah, come now, John.”"
6163,“WIRELESS”,
6164,“WIRELESS”,“But he isn’t——”
6165,“WIRELESS”,
6166,“WIRELESS”,“I don’t care. I want you to; we’ll only go round by St. Agnes. If you
6167,“WIRELESS”,don’t——”
6168,“WIRELESS”,
6169,“WIRELESS”,"He crossed to where I stood in the shadow of the dispensary counter,"
6170,“WIRELESS”,and began some sort of broken apology about a lady-friend.
6171,“WIRELESS”,
6172,“WIRELESS”,"“Yes,” she interrupted. “You take the shop for half an hour—to oblige"
6173,“WIRELESS”,"_me_, won’t you?”"
6174,“WIRELESS”,
6175,“WIRELESS”,She had a singularly rich and promising voice that well matched her
6176,“WIRELESS”,outline.
6177,“WIRELESS”,
6178,“WIRELESS”,"“All right,” I said. “I’ll do it—but you’d better wrap yourself up, Mr."
6179,“WIRELESS”,Shaynor.”
6180,“WIRELESS”,
6181,“WIRELESS”,"“Oh, a brisk walk ought to help me. We’re only going round by the"
6182,“WIRELESS”,church.” I heard him cough grievously as they went out together.
6183,“WIRELESS”,
6184,“WIRELESS”,"I refilled the stove, and, after reckless expenditure of Mr. Cashell’s"
6185,“WIRELESS”,"coal, drove some warmth into the shop. I explored many of the"
6186,“WIRELESS”,"glass-knobbed drawers that lined the walls, tasted some disconcerting"
6187,“WIRELESS”,"drugs, and, by the aid of a few cardamoms, ground ginger,"
6188,“WIRELESS”,"chloric-ether, and dilute alcohol, manufactured a new and wildish"
6189,“WIRELESS”,"drink, of which I bore a glassful to young Mr. Cashell, busy in the"
6190,“WIRELESS”,back office. He laughed shortly when I told him that Mr. Shaynor had
6191,“WIRELESS”,"stepped out—but a frail coil of wire held all his attention, and he had"
6192,“WIRELESS”,no word for me bewildered among the batteries and rods. The noise of
6193,“WIRELESS”,the sea on the beach began to make itself heard as the traffic in the
6194,“WIRELESS”,"street ceased. Then briefly, but very lucidly, he gave me the names and"
6195,“WIRELESS”,uses of the mechanism that crowded the tables and the floor.
6196,“WIRELESS”,
6197,“WIRELESS”,"“When do you expect to get the message from Poole?” I demanded, sipping"
6198,“WIRELESS”,my liquor out of a graduated glass.
6199,“WIRELESS”,
6200,“WIRELESS”,"“About midnight, if everything is in order. We’ve got our"
6201,“WIRELESS”,installation-pole fixed to the roof of the house. I shouldn’t advise
6202,“WIRELESS”,you to turn on a tap or anything tonight. We’ve connected up with the
6203,“WIRELESS”,"plumbing, and all the water will be electrified.” He repeated to me the"
6204,“WIRELESS”,history of the agitated ladies at the hotel at the time of the first
6205,“WIRELESS”,installation.
6206,“WIRELESS”,
6207,“WIRELESS”,“But what _is_ it?” I asked. “Electricity is out of my beat
6208,“WIRELESS”,altogether.”
6209,“WIRELESS”,
6210,“WIRELESS”,"“Ah, if you knew _that_ you’d know something nobody knows. It’s just"
6211,“WIRELESS”,"It—what we call Electricity, but the magic—the manifestations—the"
6212,“WIRELESS”,"Hertzian waves—are all revealed by _this_. The coherer, we call it.”"
6213,“WIRELESS”,
6214,“WIRELESS”,"He picked up a glass tube not much thicker than a thermometer, in"
6215,“WIRELESS”,"which, almost touching, were two tiny silver plugs, and between them an"
6216,“WIRELESS”,"infinitesimal pinch of metallic dust. “That’s all,” he said, proudly,"
6217,“WIRELESS”,as though himself responsible for the wonder. “That is the thing that
6218,“WIRELESS”,will reveal to us the Powers—whatever the Powers may be—at work—through
6219,“WIRELESS”,space—a long distance away.”
6220,“WIRELESS”,
6221,“WIRELESS”,Just then Mr. Shaynor returned alone and stood coughing his heart out
6222,“WIRELESS”,on the mat.
6223,“WIRELESS”,
6224,“WIRELESS”,"“Serves you right for being such a fool,” said young Mr. Cashell, as"
6225,“WIRELESS”,annoyed as myself at the interruption. “Never mind—we’ve all the night
6226,“WIRELESS”,before us to see wonders.”
6227,“WIRELESS”,
6228,“WIRELESS”,"Shaynor clutched the counter, his handkerchief to his lips. When he"
6229,“WIRELESS”,brought it away I saw two bright red stains.
6230,“WIRELESS”,
6231,“WIRELESS”,"“I—I’ve got a bit of a rasped throat from smoking cigarettes,” he"
6232,“WIRELESS”,panted. “I think I’ll try a cubeb.”
6233,“WIRELESS”,
6234,“WIRELESS”,“Better take some of this. I’ve been compounding while you’ve been
6235,“WIRELESS”,away.” I handed him the brew.
6236,“WIRELESS”,
6237,“WIRELESS”,"“’Twon’t make me drunk, will it? I’m almost a teetotaller. My word!"
6238,“WIRELESS”,That’s grateful and comforting.”
6239,“WIRELESS”,
6240,“WIRELESS”,He sat down the empty glass to cough afresh.
6241,“WIRELESS”,
6242,“WIRELESS”,“Brr! But it was cold out there! I shouldn’t care to be lying in my
6243,“WIRELESS”,grave a night like this. Don’t _you_ ever have a sore throat from
6244,“WIRELESS”,smoking?” He pocketed the handkerchief after a furtive peep.
6245,“WIRELESS”,
6246,“WIRELESS”,"“Oh, yes, sometimes,” I replied, wondering, while I spoke, into what"
6247,“WIRELESS”,agonies of terror I should fall if ever I saw those bright-red
6248,“WIRELESS”,danger-signals under my nose. Young Mr. Cashell among the batteries
6249,“WIRELESS”,coughed slightly to show that he was quite ready to continue his
6250,“WIRELESS”,"scientific explanations, but I was thinking still of the girl with the"
6251,“WIRELESS”,"rich voice and the significantly cut mouth, at whose command I had"
6252,“WIRELESS”,taken charge of the shop. It flashed across me that she distantly
6253,“WIRELESS”,resembled the seductive shape on a gold-framed toilet-water
6254,“WIRELESS”,advertisement whose charms were unholily heightened by the glare from
6255,“WIRELESS”,"the red bottle in the window. Turning to make sure, I saw Mr. Shaynor’s"
6256,“WIRELESS”,"eyes bent in the same direction, and by instinct recognised that the"
6257,“WIRELESS”,flamboyant thing was to him a shrine. “What do you take for
6258,“WIRELESS”,your—cough?” I asked.
6259,“WIRELESS”,
6260,“WIRELESS”,"“Well, I’m the wrong side of the counter to believe much in patent"
6261,“WIRELESS”,medicines. But there are asthma cigarettes and there are pastilles. To
6262,“WIRELESS”,"tell you the truth, if you don’t object to the smell, which is very"
6263,“WIRELESS”,"like incense, I believe, though I’m not a Roman Catholic, Blaudett’s"
6264,“WIRELESS”,Cathedral Pastilles relieve me as much as anything.”
6265,“WIRELESS”,
6266,“WIRELESS”,"“Let’s try.” I had never raided a chemist’s shop before, so I was"
6267,“WIRELESS”,"thorough. We unearthed the pastilles—brown, gummy cones of benzoin—and"
6268,“WIRELESS”,"set them alight under the toilet-water advertisement, where they fumed"
6269,“WIRELESS”,in thin blue spirals.
6270,“WIRELESS”,
6271,“WIRELESS”,"“Of course,” said Mr. Shaynor, to my question, “what one uses in the"
6272,“WIRELESS”,"shop for one’s self comes out of one’s pocket. Why, stock-taking in our"
6273,“WIRELESS”,business is nearly the same as with jewellers—and I can’t say more than
6274,“WIRELESS”,that. But one gets them”—he pointed to the pastille-box—“at trade
6275,“WIRELESS”,"prices.” Evidently the censing of the gay, seven-tinted wench with the"
6276,“WIRELESS”,teeth was an established ritual which cost something.
6277,“WIRELESS”,
6278,“WIRELESS”,“And when do we shut up shop?”
6279,“WIRELESS”,
6280,“WIRELESS”,“We stay like this all night. The gov—old Mr. Cashell—doesn’t believe
6281,“WIRELESS”,in locks and shutters as compared with electric light. Besides it
6282,“WIRELESS”,brings trade. I’ll just sit here in the chair by the stove and write a
6283,“WIRELESS”,"letter, if you don’t mind. Electricity isn’t my prescription.”"
6284,“WIRELESS”,
6285,“WIRELESS”,"The energetic young Mr. Cashell snorted within, and Shaynor settled"
6286,“WIRELESS”,"himself up in his chair over which he had thrown a staring red, black,"
6287,“WIRELESS”,"and yellow Austrian jute blanket, rather like a table-cover. I cast"
6288,“WIRELESS”,"about, amid patent medicine pamphlets, for something to read, but"
6289,“WIRELESS”,"finding little, returned to the manufacture of the new drink. The"
6290,“WIRELESS”,Italian warehouse took down its game and went to bed. Across the street
6291,“WIRELESS”,blank shutters flung back the gaslight in cold smears; the dried
6292,“WIRELESS”,pavement seemed to rough up in goose-flesh under the scouring of the
6293,“WIRELESS”,"savage wind, and we could hear, long ere he passed, the policeman"
6294,“WIRELESS”,"flapping his arms to keep himself warm. Within, the flavours of"
6295,“WIRELESS”,cardamoms and chloric-ether disputed those of the pastilles and a score
6296,“WIRELESS”,"of drugs and perfume and soap scents. Our electric lights, set low down"
6297,“WIRELESS”,"in the windows before the tun-bellied Rosamund jars, flung inward three"
6298,“WIRELESS”,"monstrous daubs of red, blue, and green, that broke into kaleidoscopic"
6299,“WIRELESS”,"lights on the facetted knobs of the drug-drawers, the cut-glass scent"
6300,“WIRELESS”,"flagons, and the bulbs of the sparklet bottles. They flushed the"
6301,“WIRELESS”,white-tiled floor in gorgeous patches; splashed along the nickel-silver
6302,“WIRELESS”,"counter-rails, and turned the polished mahogany counter-panels to the"
6303,“WIRELESS”,likeness of intricate grained marbles—slabs of porphyry and malachite.
6304,“WIRELESS”,"Mr. Shaynor unlocked a drawer, and ere he began to write, took out a"
6305,“WIRELESS”,"meagre bundle of letters. From my place by the stove, I could see the"
6306,“WIRELESS”,scalloped edges of the paper with a flaring monogram in the corner and
6307,“WIRELESS”,could even smell the reek of chypre. At each page he turned toward the
6308,“WIRELESS”,toilet-water lady of the advertisement and devoured her with
6309,“WIRELESS”,over-luminous eyes. He had drawn the Austrian blanket over his
6310,“WIRELESS”,"shoulders, and among those warring lights he looked more than ever the"
6311,“WIRELESS”,incarnation of a drugged moth—a tiger-moth as I thought.
6312,“WIRELESS”,
6313,“WIRELESS”,"He put his letter into an envelope, stamped it with stiff mechanical"
6314,“WIRELESS”,"movements, and dropped it in the drawer. Then I became aware of the"
6315,“WIRELESS”,silence of a great city asleep—the silence that underlaid the even
6316,“WIRELESS”,"voice of the breakers along the sea-front—a thick, tingling quiet of"
6317,“WIRELESS”,"warm life stilled down for its appointed time, and unconsciously I"
6318,“WIRELESS”,moved about the glittering shop as one moves in a sick-room. Young Mr.
6319,“WIRELESS”,Cashell was adjusting some wire that crackled from time to time with
6320,“WIRELESS”,"the tense, knuckle-stretching sound of the electric spark. Upstairs,"
6321,“WIRELESS”,"where a door shut and opened swiftly, I could hear his uncle coughing"
6322,“WIRELESS”,abed.
6323,“WIRELESS”,
6324,“WIRELESS”,"“Here,” I said, when the drink was properly warmed, “take some of this,"
6325,“WIRELESS”,Mr. Shaynor.”
6326,“WIRELESS”,
6327,“WIRELESS”,"He jerked in his chair with a start and a wrench, and held out his hand"
6328,“WIRELESS”,"for the glass. The mixture, of a rich port-wine colour, frothed at the"
6329,“WIRELESS”,top.
6330,“WIRELESS”,
6331,“WIRELESS”,"“It looks,” he said, suddenly, “it looks—those bubbles—like a string of"
6332,“WIRELESS”,pearls winking at you—rather like the pearls round that young lady’s
6333,“WIRELESS”,neck.” He turned again to the advertisement where the female in the
6334,“WIRELESS”,dove-coloured corset had seen fit to put on all her pearls before she
6335,“WIRELESS”,cleaned her teeth.
6336,“WIRELESS”,
6337,“WIRELESS”,"“Not bad, is it?” I said."
6338,“WIRELESS”,
6339,“WIRELESS”,“Eh?”
6340,“WIRELESS”,
6341,“WIRELESS”,"He rolled his eyes heavily full on me, and, as I stared, I beheld all"
6342,“WIRELESS”,meaning and consciousness die out of the swiftly dilating pupils. His
6343,“WIRELESS”,"figure lost its stark rigidity, softened into the chair, and, chin on"
6344,“WIRELESS”,"chest, hands dropped before him, he rested open-eyed, absolutely still."
6345,“WIRELESS”,
6346,“WIRELESS”,"“I’m afraid I’ve rather cooked Shaynor’s goose,” I said, bearing the"
6347,“WIRELESS”,fresh drink to young Mr. Cashell. “Perhaps it was the chloric-ether.”
6348,“WIRELESS”,
6349,“WIRELESS”,"“Oh, he’s all right.” The spade-bearded man glanced at him pityingly."
6350,“WIRELESS”,“Consumptives go off in those sort of doses very often. It’s
6351,“WIRELESS”,exhaustion… I don’t wonder. I dare say the liquor will do him good.
6352,“WIRELESS”,"It’s grand stuff,” he finished his share appreciatively. “Well, as I"
6353,“WIRELESS”,was saying—before he interrupted—about this little coherer. The pinch
6354,“WIRELESS”,"of dust, you see, is nickel-filings. The Hertzian waves, you see, come"
6355,“WIRELESS”,"out of space from the station that despatches ’em, and all these little"
6356,“WIRELESS”,"particles are attracted together—cohere, we call it—for just so long as"
6357,“WIRELESS”,"the current passes through them. Now, it’s important to remember that"
6358,“WIRELESS”,the current is an induced current. There are a good many kinds of
6359,“WIRELESS”,induction——”
6360,“WIRELESS”,
6361,“WIRELESS”,"“Yes, but what _is_ induction?”"
6362,“WIRELESS”,
6363,“WIRELESS”,“That’s rather hard to explain untechnically. But the long and the
6364,“WIRELESS”,short of it is that when a current of electricity passes through a wire
6365,“WIRELESS”,there’s a lot of magnetism present round that wire; and if you put
6366,“WIRELESS”,"another wire parallel to, and within what we call its magnetic"
6367,“WIRELESS”,"field—why then, the second wire will also become charged with"
6368,“WIRELESS”,electricity.”
6369,“WIRELESS”,
6370,“WIRELESS”,“On its own account?”
6371,“WIRELESS”,
6372,“WIRELESS”,“On its own account.”
6373,“WIRELESS”,
6374,“WIRELESS”,"“Then let’s see if I’ve got it correctly. Miles off, at Poole, or"
6375,“WIRELESS”,wherever it is——”
6376,“WIRELESS”,
6377,“WIRELESS”,“It will be anywhere in ten years.”
6378,“WIRELESS”,
6379,“WIRELESS”,“You’ve got a charged wire——”
6380,“WIRELESS”,
6381,“WIRELESS”,"“Charged with Hertzian waves which vibrate, say, two hundred and thirty"
6382,“WIRELESS”,million times a second.” Mr. Cashell snaked his forefinger rapidly
6383,“WIRELESS”,through the air.
6384,“WIRELESS”,
6385,“WIRELESS”,"“All right—a charged wire at Poole, giving out these waves into space."
6386,“WIRELESS”,Then this wire of yours sticking out into space—on the roof of the
6387,“WIRELESS”,house—in some mysterious way gets charged with those waves from
6388,“WIRELESS”,Poole——”
6389,“WIRELESS”,
6390,“WIRELESS”,“Or anywhere—it only happens to be Poole tonight.”
6391,“WIRELESS”,
6392,“WIRELESS”,"“And those waves set the coherer at work, just like an ordinary"
6393,“WIRELESS”,telegraph-office ticker?”
6394,“WIRELESS”,
6395,“WIRELESS”,“No! That’s where so many people make the mistake. The Hertzian waves
6396,“WIRELESS”,wouldn’t be strong enough to work a great heavy Morse instrument like
6397,“WIRELESS”,"ours. They can only just make that dust cohere, and while it coheres (a"
6398,“WIRELESS”,little while for a dot and a longer while for a dash) the current from
6399,“WIRELESS”,this battery—the home battery”—he laid his hand on the thing—“can get
6400,“WIRELESS”,through to the Morse printing-machine to record the dot or dash. Let me
6401,“WIRELESS”,make it clearer. Do you know anything about steam?”
6402,“WIRELESS”,
6403,“WIRELESS”,“Very little. But go on.”
6404,“WIRELESS”,
6405,“WIRELESS”,"“Well, the coherer is like a steam-valve. Any child can open a valve"
6406,“WIRELESS”,"and start a steamer’s engines, because a turn of the hand lets in the"
6407,“WIRELESS”,"main steam, doesn’t it? Now, this home battery here ready to print is"
6408,“WIRELESS”,"the main steam. The coherer is the valve, always ready to be turned on."
6409,“WIRELESS”,The Hertzian wave is the child’s hand that turns it.”
6410,“WIRELESS”,
6411,“WIRELESS”,“I see. That’s marvellous.”
6412,“WIRELESS”,
6413,“WIRELESS”,"“Marvellous, isn’t it? And, remember, we’re only at the beginning."
6414,“WIRELESS”,There’s nothing we sha’n’t be able to do in ten years. I want to
6415,“WIRELESS”,"live—my God, how I want to live, and see it develop!” He looked through"
6416,“WIRELESS”,the door at Shaynor breathing lightly in his chair. “Poor beast! And he
6417,“WIRELESS”,wants to keep company with Fanny Brand.”
6418,“WIRELESS”,
6419,“WIRELESS”,"“Fanny _who_?” I said, for the name struck an obscurely familiar chord"
6420,“WIRELESS”,"in my brain—something connected with a stained handkerchief, and the"
6421,“WIRELESS”,word “arterial.”
6422,“WIRELESS”,
6423,“WIRELESS”,"“Fanny Brand—the girl you kept shop for.” He laughed, “That’s all I"
6424,“WIRELESS”,"know about her, and for the life of me I can’t see what Shaynor sees in"
6425,“WIRELESS”,"her, or she in him.”"
6426,“WIRELESS”,
6427,“WIRELESS”,“_Can’t_ you see what he sees in her?” I insisted.
6428,“WIRELESS”,
6429,“WIRELESS”,"“Oh, yes, if _that’s_ what you mean. She’s a great, big, fat lump of a"
6430,“WIRELESS”,"girl, and so on. I suppose that’s why he’s so crazy after her. She"
6431,“WIRELESS”,"isn’t his sort. Well, it doesn’t matter. My uncle says he’s bound to"
6432,“WIRELESS”,"die before the year’s out. Your drink’s given him a good sleep, at any"
6433,“WIRELESS”,"rate.” Young Mr. Cashell could not catch Mr. Shaynor’s face, which was"
6434,“WIRELESS”,half turned to the advertisement.
6435,“WIRELESS”,
6436,“WIRELESS”,"I stoked the stove anew, for the room was growing cold, and lighted"
6437,“WIRELESS”,"another pastille. Mr. Shaynor in his chair, never moving, looked"
6438,“WIRELESS”,through and over me with eyes as wide and lustreless as those of a dead
6439,“WIRELESS”,hare.
6440,“WIRELESS”,
6441,“WIRELESS”,"“Poole’s late,” said young Mr. Cashell, when I stepped back. “I’ll just"
6442,“WIRELESS”,send them a call.”
6443,“WIRELESS”,
6444,“WIRELESS”,"He pressed a key in the semi-darkness, and with a rending crackle there"
6445,“WIRELESS”,"leaped between two brass knobs a spark, streams of sparks, and sparks"
6446,“WIRELESS”,again.
6447,“WIRELESS”,
6448,“WIRELESS”,"“Grand, isn’t it? _That’s_ the Power—our unknown Power—kicking and"
6449,“WIRELESS”,"fighting to be let loose,” said young Mr. Cashell. “There she"
6450,“WIRELESS”,goes—kick—kick—kick into space. I never get over the strangeness of it
6451,“WIRELESS”,"when I work a sending-machine—waves going into space, you know. T.R. is"
6452,“WIRELESS”,our call. Poole ought to answer with L.L.L.”
6453,“WIRELESS”,
6454,“WIRELESS”,"We waited two, three, five minutes. In that silence, of which the boom"
6455,“WIRELESS”,"of the tide was an orderly part, I caught the clear “_kiss—kiss—kiss_”"
6456,“WIRELESS”,"of the halliards on the roof, as they were blown against the"
6457,“WIRELESS”,installation-pole.
6458,“WIRELESS”,
6459,“WIRELESS”,“Poole is not ready. I’ll stay here and call you when he is.”
6460,“WIRELESS”,
6461,“WIRELESS”,"I returned to the shop, and set down my glass on a marble slab with a"
6462,“WIRELESS”,"careless clink. As I did so, Shaynor rose to his feet, his eyes fixed"
6463,“WIRELESS”,"once more on the advertisement, where the young woman bathed in the"
6464,“WIRELESS”,light from the red jar simpered pinkly over her pearls. His lips moved
6465,“WIRELESS”,without cessation. I stepped nearer to listen. “And threw—and threw—and
6466,“WIRELESS”,"threw,” he repeated, his face all sharp with some inexplicable agony."
6467,“WIRELESS”,
6468,“WIRELESS”,I moved forward astonished. But it was then he found words—delivered
6469,“WIRELESS”,roundly and clearly. These:—
6470,“WIRELESS”,
6471,“WIRELESS”,And threw warm gules on Madeleine’s young breast.
6472,“WIRELESS”,
6473,“WIRELESS”,
6474,“WIRELESS”,"The trouble passed off his countenance, and he returned lightly to his"
6475,“WIRELESS”,"place, rubbing his hands."
6476,“WIRELESS”,
6477,“WIRELESS”,"It had never occurred to me, though we had many times discussed reading"
6478,“WIRELESS”,"and prize-competitions as a diversion, that Mr. Shaynor ever read"
6479,“WIRELESS”,"Keats, or could quote him at all appositely. There was, after all, a"
6480,“WIRELESS”,certain stained-glass effect of light on the high bosom of the
6481,“WIRELESS”,"highly-polished picture which might, by stretch of fancy, suggest, as a"
6482,“WIRELESS”,"vile chromo recalls some incomparable canvas, the line he had spoken."
6483,“WIRELESS”,"Night, my drink, and solitude were evidently turning Mr. Shaynor into a"
6484,“WIRELESS”,"poet. He sat down again and wrote swiftly on his villainous note-paper,"
6485,“WIRELESS”,his lips quivering.
6486,“WIRELESS”,
6487,“WIRELESS”,I shut the door into the inner office and moved up behind him. He made
6488,“WIRELESS”,"no sign that he saw or heard. I looked over his shoulder, and read,"
6489,“WIRELESS”,"amid half-formed words, sentences, and wild scratches:—"
6490,“WIRELESS”,
6491,“WIRELESS”,—Very cold it was. Very cold
6492,“WIRELESS”,The hare—the hare—the hare—
6493,“WIRELESS”,The birds——
6494,“WIRELESS”,
6495,“WIRELESS”,
6496,“WIRELESS”,"He raised his head sharply, and frowned toward the blank shutters of"
6497,“WIRELESS”,the poulterer’s shop where they jutted out against our window. Then one
6498,“WIRELESS”,clear line came:—
6499,“WIRELESS”,
6500,“WIRELESS”,"The hare, in spite of fur, was very cold."
6501,“WIRELESS”,
6502,“WIRELESS”,
6503,“WIRELESS”,"The head, moving machine-like, turned right to the advertisement where"
6504,“WIRELESS”,"the Blaudett’s Cathedral pastille reeked abominably. He grunted, and"
6505,“WIRELESS”,went on:—
6506,“WIRELESS”,
6507,“WIRELESS”,Incense in a censer—
6508,“WIRELESS”,Before her darling picture framed in gold—
6509,“WIRELESS”,Maiden’s picture—angel’s portrait—
6510,“WIRELESS”,
6511,“WIRELESS”,
6512,“WIRELESS”,"“Hsh!” said Mr. Cashell guardedly from the inner office, as though in"
6513,“WIRELESS”,the presence of spirits. “There’s something coming through from
6514,“WIRELESS”,somewhere; but it isn’t Poole.” I heard the crackle of sparks as he
6515,“WIRELESS”,"depressed the keys of the transmitter. In my own brain, too, something"
6516,“WIRELESS”,"crackled, or it might have been the hair on my head. Then I heard my"
6517,“WIRELESS”,"own voice, in a harsh whisper: “Mr. Cashell, there is something coming"
6518,“WIRELESS”,"through here, too. Leave me alone till I tell you.”"
6519,“WIRELESS”,
6520,“WIRELESS”,"“But I thought you’d come to see this wonderful thing—Sir,” indignantly"
6521,“WIRELESS”,at the end.
6522,“WIRELESS”,
6523,“WIRELESS”,“Leave me alone till I tell you. Be quiet.”
6524,“WIRELESS”,
6525,“WIRELESS”,I watched—I waited. Under the blue-veined hand—the dry hand of the
6526,“WIRELESS”,"consumptive—came away clear, without erasure:"
6527,“WIRELESS”,
6528,“WIRELESS”,And my weak spirit fails
6529,“WIRELESS”,To think how the dead must freeze—
6530,“WIRELESS”,
6531,“WIRELESS”,
6532,“WIRELESS”,he shivered as he wrote—
6533,“WIRELESS”,
6534,“WIRELESS”,Beneath the churchyard mould.
6535,“WIRELESS”,
6536,“WIRELESS”,
6537,“WIRELESS”,"Then he stopped, laid the pen down, and leaned back."
6538,“WIRELESS”,
6539,“WIRELESS”,"For an instant, that was half an eternity, the shop spun before me in a"
6540,“WIRELESS”,"rainbow-tinted whirl, in and through which my own soul most"
6541,“WIRELESS”,dispassionately considered my own soul as that fought with an
6542,“WIRELESS”,over-mastering fear. Then I smelt the strong smell of cigarettes from
6543,“WIRELESS”,"Mr. Shaynor’s clothing, and heard, as though it had been the rending of"
6544,“WIRELESS”,"trumpets, the rattle of his breathing. I was still in my place of"
6545,“WIRELESS”,"observation, much as one would watch a rifle-shot at the butts,"
6546,“WIRELESS”,"half-bent, hands on my knees, and head within a few inches of the"
6547,“WIRELESS”,"black, red, and yellow blanket of his shoulder. I was whispering"
6548,“WIRELESS”,"encouragement, evidently to my other self, sounding sentences, such as"
6549,“WIRELESS”,men pronounce in dreams.
6550,“WIRELESS”,
6551,“WIRELESS”,"“If he has read Keats, it proves nothing. If he hasn’t—like causes"
6552,“WIRELESS”,_must_ beget like effects. There is no escape from this law. _You_
6553,“WIRELESS”,ought to be grateful that you know ‘St. Agnes Eve’ without the book;
6554,“WIRELESS”,"because, given the circumstances, such as Fanny Brand, who is the key"
6555,“WIRELESS”,"of the enigma, and approximately represents the latitude and longitude"
6556,“WIRELESS”,of Fanny Brawne; allowing also for the bright red colour of the
6557,“WIRELESS”,"arterial blood upon the handkerchief, which was just what you were"
6558,“WIRELESS”,puzzling over in the shop just now; and counting the effect of the
6559,“WIRELESS”,"professional environment, here almost perfectly duplicated—the result"
6560,“WIRELESS”,is logical and inevitable. As inevitable as induction.”
6561,“WIRELESS”,
6562,“WIRELESS”,"Still, the other half of my soul refused to be comforted. It was"
6563,“WIRELESS”,cowering in some minute and inadequate corner—at an immense distance.
6564,“WIRELESS”,
6565,“WIRELESS”,"Hereafter, I found myself one person again, my hands still gripping my"
6566,“WIRELESS”,"knees, and my eyes glued on the page before Mr. Shaynor. As dreamers"
6567,“WIRELESS”,accept and explain the upheaval of landscapes and the resurrection of
6568,“WIRELESS”,"the dead, with excerpts from the evening hymn or the"
6569,“WIRELESS”,"multiplication-table, so I had accepted the facts, whatever they might"
6570,“WIRELESS”,"be, that I should witness, and had devised a theory, sane and plausible"
6571,“WIRELESS”,"to my mind, that explained them all. Nay, I was even in advance of my"
6572,“WIRELESS”,"facts, walking hurriedly before them, assured that they would fit my"
6573,“WIRELESS”,theory. And all that I now recall of that epoch-making theory are the
6574,“WIRELESS”,lofty words: “If he has read Keats it’s the chloric-ether. If he
6575,“WIRELESS”,"hasn’t, it’s the identical bacillus, or Hertzian wave of tuberculosis,"
6576,“WIRELESS”,"_plus_ Fanny Brand and the professional status which, in conjunction"
6577,“WIRELESS”,"with the main-stream of subconscious thought common to all mankind, has"
6578,“WIRELESS”,thrown up temporarily an induced Keats.”
6579,“WIRELESS”,
6580,“WIRELESS”,"Mr. Shaynor returned to his work, erasing and rewriting as before with"
6581,“WIRELESS”,"swiftness. Two or three blank pages he tossed aside. Then he wrote,"
6582,“WIRELESS”,muttering:
6583,“WIRELESS”,
6584,“WIRELESS”,The little smoke of a candle that goes out.
6585,“WIRELESS”,
6586,“WIRELESS”,
6587,“WIRELESS”,"“No,” he muttered. “Little smoke—little smoke—little smoke. What else?”"
6588,“WIRELESS”,"He thrust his chin forward toward the advertisement, whereunder the"
6589,“WIRELESS”,last of the Blaudett’s Cathedral pastilles fumed in its holder. “Ah!”
6590,“WIRELESS”,Then with relief:—
6591,“WIRELESS”,
6592,“WIRELESS”,The little smoke that dies in moonlight cold.
6593,“WIRELESS”,
6594,“WIRELESS”,
6595,“WIRELESS”,"Evidently he was snared by the rhymes of his first verse, for he wrote"
6596,“WIRELESS”,and rewrote “gold—cold—mould” many times. Again he sought inspiration
6597,“WIRELESS”,"from the advertisement, and set down, without erasure, the line I had"
6598,“WIRELESS”,overheard:
6599,“WIRELESS”,
6600,“WIRELESS”,And threw warm gules on Madeleine’s young breast.
6601,“WIRELESS”,
6602,“WIRELESS”,
6603,“WIRELESS”,As I remembered the original it is “fair”—a trite word—instead of
6604,“WIRELESS”,"“young,” and I found myself nodding approval, though I admitted that"
6605,“WIRELESS”,the attempt to reproduce “its little smoke in pallid moonlight died”
6606,“WIRELESS”,was a failure.
6607,“WIRELESS”,
6608,“WIRELESS”,Followed without a break ten or fifteen lines of bald prose—the naked
6609,“WIRELESS”,soul’s confession of its physical yearning for its beloved—unclean as
6610,“WIRELESS”,"we count uncleanliness; unwholesome, but human exceedingly; the raw"
6611,“WIRELESS”,"material, so it seemed to me in that hour and in that place, whence"
6612,“WIRELESS”,"Keats wove the twenty-sixth, seventh, and eighth stanzas of his poem."
6613,“WIRELESS”,Shame I had none in overseeing this revelation; and my fear had gone
6614,“WIRELESS”,with the smoke of the pastille.
6615,“WIRELESS”,
6616,“WIRELESS”,"“That’s it,” I murmured. “That’s how it’s blocked out. Go on! Ink it"
6617,“WIRELESS”,"in, man. Ink it in!”"
6618,“WIRELESS”,
6619,“WIRELESS”,Mr. Shaynor returned to broken verse wherein “loveliness” was made to
6620,“WIRELESS”,rhyme with a desire to look upon “her empty dress.” He picked up a fold
6621,“WIRELESS”,"of the gay, soft blanket, spread it over one hand, caressed it with"
6622,“WIRELESS”,"infinite tenderness, thought, muttered, traced some snatches which I"
6623,“WIRELESS”,"could not decipher, shut his eyes drowsily, shook his head, and dropped"
6624,“WIRELESS”,"the stuff. Here I found myself at fault, for I could not then see (as I"
6625,“WIRELESS”,"do now) in what manner a red, black, and yellow Austrian blanket"
6626,“WIRELESS”,coloured his dreams.
6627,“WIRELESS”,
6628,“WIRELESS”,"In a few minutes he laid aside his pen, and, chin on hand, considered"
6629,“WIRELESS”,the shop with thoughtful and intelligent eyes. He threw down the
6630,“WIRELESS”,"blanket, rose, passed along a line of drug-drawers, and read the names"
6631,“WIRELESS”,"on the labels aloud. Returning, he took from his desk Christie’s _New"
6632,“WIRELESS”,"Commercial Plants_ and the old Culpepper that I had given him, opened"
6633,“WIRELESS”,"and laid them side by side with a clerky air, all trace of passion gone"
6634,“WIRELESS”,"from his face, read first in one and then in the other, and paused with"
6635,“WIRELESS”,pen behind his ear.
6636,“WIRELESS”,
6637,“WIRELESS”,“What wonder of Heaven’s coming now?” I thought.
6638,“WIRELESS”,
6639,“WIRELESS”,"“Manna—manna—manna,” he said at last, under wrinkled brows. “That’s"
6640,“WIRELESS”,"what I wanted. Good! Now then! Now then! Good! Good! Oh, by God, that’s"
6641,“WIRELESS”,good!” His voice rose and he spoke rightly and fully without a falter:—
6642,“WIRELESS”,
6643,“WIRELESS”,"Candied apple, quince and plum and gourd,"
6644,“WIRELESS”,"And jellies smoother than the creamy curd,"
6645,“WIRELESS”,"And lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon,"
6646,“WIRELESS”,Manna and dates in Argosy transferred
6647,“WIRELESS”,"From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one"
6648,“WIRELESS”,From silken Samarcand to cedared Lebanon.
6649,“WIRELESS”,
6650,“WIRELESS”,
6651,“WIRELESS”,"He repeated it once more, using “blander” for “smoother” in the second"
6652,“WIRELESS”,"line; then wrote it down without erasure, but this time (my set eyes"
6653,“WIRELESS”,missed no stroke of any word) he substituted “soother” for his
6654,“WIRELESS”,"atrocious second thought, so that it came away under his hand as it is"
6655,“WIRELESS”,written in the book—as it is written in the book.
6656,“WIRELESS”,
6657,“WIRELESS”,"A wind went shouting down the street, and on the heels of the wind"
6658,“WIRELESS”,followed a spurt and rattle of rain.
6659,“WIRELESS”,
6660,“WIRELESS”,"After a smiling pause—and good right had he to smile—he began anew,"
6661,“WIRELESS”,always tossing the last sheet over his shoulder:—
6662,“WIRELESS”,
6663,“WIRELESS”,"“The sharp rain falling on the window-pane,"
6664,“WIRELESS”,Rattling sleet—the wind-blown sleet.”
6665,“WIRELESS”,
6666,“WIRELESS”,
6667,“WIRELESS”,Then prose: “It is very cold of mornings when the wind brings rain and
6668,“WIRELESS”,"sleet with it. I heard the sleet on the window-pane outside, and"
6669,“WIRELESS”,"thought of you, my darling. I am always thinking of you. I wish we"
6670,“WIRELESS”,could both run away like two lovers into the storm and get that little
6671,“WIRELESS”,"cottage by the sea which we are always thinking about, my own dear"
6672,“WIRELESS”,darling. We could sit and watch the sea beneath our windows. It would
6673,“WIRELESS”,be a fairyland all of our own—a fairy sea—a fairy sea….”
6674,“WIRELESS”,
6675,“WIRELESS”,"He stopped, raised his head, and listened. The steady drone of the"
6676,“WIRELESS”,Channel along the sea-front that had borne us company so long leaped up
6677,“WIRELESS”,a note to the sudden fuller surge that signals the change from ebb to
6678,“WIRELESS”,flood. It beat in like the change of step throughout an army—this
6679,“WIRELESS”,"renewed pulse of the sea—and filled our ears till they, accepting it,"
6680,“WIRELESS”,marked it no longer.
6681,“WIRELESS”,
6682,“WIRELESS”,“A fairyland for you and me
6683,“WIRELESS”,Across the foam—beyond …
6684,“WIRELESS”,"A magic foam, a perilous sea.”"
6685,“WIRELESS”,
6686,“WIRELESS”,
6687,“WIRELESS”,"He grunted again with effort and bit his underlip. My throat dried, but"
6688,“WIRELESS”,I dared not gulp to moisten it lest I should break the spell that was
6689,“WIRELESS”,drawing him nearer and nearer to the high-water mark but two of the
6690,“WIRELESS”,sons of Adam have reached. Remember that in all the millions permitted
6691,“WIRELESS”,there are no more than five—five little lines—of which one can say:
6692,“WIRELESS”,“These are the pure Magic. These are the clear Vision. The rest is only
6693,“WIRELESS”,poetry.” And Mr. Shaynor was playing hot and cold with two of them!
6694,“WIRELESS”,
6695,“WIRELESS”,I vowed no unconscious thought of mine should influence the blindfold
6696,“WIRELESS”,"soul, and pinned myself desperately to the other three, repeating and"
6697,“WIRELESS”,re-repeating:
6698,“WIRELESS”,
6699,“WIRELESS”,A savage spot as holy and enchanted
6700,“WIRELESS”,As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
6701,“WIRELESS”,By woman wailing for her demon lover.
6702,“WIRELESS”,
6703,“WIRELESS”,
6704,“WIRELESS”,"But though I believed my brain thus occupied, my every sense hung upon"
6705,“WIRELESS”,"the writing under the dry, bony hand, all brown-fingered with chemicals"
6706,“WIRELESS”,and cigarette-smoke.
6707,“WIRELESS”,
6708,“WIRELESS”,"Our windows fronting on the dangerous foam,"
6709,“WIRELESS”,
6710,“WIRELESS”,
6711,“WIRELESS”,"(he wrote, after long, irresolute snatches), and then—"
6712,“WIRELESS”,
6713,“WIRELESS”,“Our open casements facing desolate seas
6714,“WIRELESS”,Forlorn—forlorn—”
6715,“WIRELESS”,
6716,“WIRELESS”,
6717,“WIRELESS”,Here again his face grew peaked and anxious with that sense of loss I
6718,“WIRELESS”,had first seen when the Power snatched him. But this time the agony was
6719,“WIRELESS”,tenfold keener. As I watched it mounted like mercury in the tube. It
6720,“WIRELESS”,lighted his face from within till I thought the visibly scourged soul
6721,“WIRELESS”,"must leap forth naked between his jaws, unable to endure. A drop of"
6722,“WIRELESS”,sweat trickled from my forehead down my nose and splashed on the back
6723,“WIRELESS”,of my hand.
6724,“WIRELESS”,
6725,“WIRELESS”,“Our windows facing on the desolate seas
6726,“WIRELESS”,And pearly foam of magic fairyland—”
6727,“WIRELESS”,
6728,“WIRELESS”,
6729,“WIRELESS”,"“Not yet—not yet,” he muttered, “wait a minute. _Please_ wait a minute."
6730,“WIRELESS”,I shall get it then—”
6731,“WIRELESS”,
6732,“WIRELESS”,"Our magic windows fronting on the sea,"
6733,“WIRELESS”,The dangerous foam of desolate seas …
6734,“WIRELESS”,For aye.
6735,“WIRELESS”,
6736,“WIRELESS”,
6737,“WIRELESS”,"_Ouh_, my God!”"
6738,“WIRELESS”,
6739,“WIRELESS”,From head to heel he shook—shook from the marrow of his bones
6740,“WIRELESS”,"outwards—then leaped to his feet with raised arms, and slid the chair"
6741,“WIRELESS”,screeching across the tiled floor where it struck the drawers behind
6742,“WIRELESS”,"and fell with a jar. Mechanically, I stooped to recover it."
6743,“WIRELESS”,
6744,“WIRELESS”,"As I rose, Mr. Shaynor was stretching and yawning at leisure."
6745,“WIRELESS”,
6746,“WIRELESS”,"“I’ve had a bit of a doze,” he said. “How did I come to knock the chair"
6747,“WIRELESS”,over? You look rather—”
6748,“WIRELESS”,
6749,“WIRELESS”,"“The chair startled me,” I answered. “It was so sudden in this quiet.”"
6750,“WIRELESS”,
6751,“WIRELESS”,Young Mr. Cashell behind his shut door was offendedly silent.
6752,“WIRELESS”,
6753,“WIRELESS”,"“I suppose I must have been dreaming,” said Mr. Shaynor."
6754,“WIRELESS”,
6755,“WIRELESS”,"“I suppose you must,” I said. “Talking of dreams—I—I noticed you"
6756,“WIRELESS”,writing—before—”
6757,“WIRELESS”,
6758,“WIRELESS”,He flushed consciously.
6759,“WIRELESS”,
6760,“WIRELESS”,“I meant to ask you if you’ve ever read anything written by a man
6761,“WIRELESS”,called Keats.”
6762,“WIRELESS”,
6763,“WIRELESS”,"“Oh! I haven’t much time to read poetry, and I can’t say that I"
6764,“WIRELESS”,remember the name exactly. Is he a popular writer?”
6765,“WIRELESS”,
6766,“WIRELESS”,“Middling. I thought you might know him because he’s the only poet who
6767,“WIRELESS”,was ever a druggist. And he’s rather what’s called the lover’s poet.”
6768,“WIRELESS”,
6769,“WIRELESS”,“Indeed. I must dip into him. What did he write about?”
6770,“WIRELESS”,
6771,“WIRELESS”,“A lot of things. Here’s a sample that may interest you.”
6772,“WIRELESS”,
6773,“WIRELESS”,"Then and there, carefully, I repeated the verse he had twice spoken and"
6774,“WIRELESS”,once written not ten minutes ago.
6775,“WIRELESS”,
6776,“WIRELESS”,“Ah. Anybody could see he was a druggist from that line about the
6777,“WIRELESS”,tinctures and syrups. It’s a fine tribute to our profession.”
6778,“WIRELESS”,
6779,“WIRELESS”,"“I don’t know,” said young Mr. Cashell, with icy politeness, opening"
6780,“WIRELESS”,"the door one half-inch, “if you still happen to be interested in our"
6781,“WIRELESS”,"trifling experiments. But, should such be the case——”"
6782,“WIRELESS”,
6783,“WIRELESS”,"I drew him aside, whispering, “Shaynor seemed going off into some sort"
6784,“WIRELESS”,"of fit when I spoke to you just now. I thought, even at the risk of"
6785,“WIRELESS”,"being rude, it wouldn’t do to take you off your instruments just as the"
6786,“WIRELESS”,call was coming through. Don’t you see?”
6787,“WIRELESS”,
6788,“WIRELESS”,"“Granted—granted as soon as asked,” he said unbending. “I _did_ think"
6789,“WIRELESS”,it a shade odd at the time. So that was why he knocked the chair down?”
6790,“WIRELESS”,
6791,“WIRELESS”,"“I hope I haven’t missed anything,” I said. “I’m afraid I can’t say"
6792,“WIRELESS”,"that, but you’re just in time for the end of a rather curious"
6793,“WIRELESS”,"performance. You can come in, too, Mr. Shaynor. Listen, while I read it"
6794,“WIRELESS”,off.”
6795,“WIRELESS”,
6796,“WIRELESS”,The Morse instrument was ticking furiously. Mr. Cashell interpreted:
6797,“WIRELESS”,“‘_K.K.V. Can make nothing of your signals_.’” A pause. “‘_M.M.V.
6798,“WIRELESS”,M.M.V. Signals unintelligible. Purpose anchor Sandown Bay. Examine
6799,“WIRELESS”,instruments to-morrow.’_ Do you know what that means? It’s a couple of
6800,“WIRELESS”,men-o’-war working Marconi signals off the Isle of Wight. They are
6801,“WIRELESS”,"trying to talk to each other. Neither can read the other’s messages,"
6802,“WIRELESS”,but all their messages are being taken in by our receiver here. They’ve
6803,“WIRELESS”,been going on for ever so long. I wish you could have heard it.”
6804,“WIRELESS”,
6805,“WIRELESS”,“How wonderful!” I said. “Do you mean we’re overhearing Portsmouth
6806,“WIRELESS”,ships trying to talk to each other—that we’re eavesdropping across half
6807,“WIRELESS”,South England?”
6808,“WIRELESS”,
6809,“WIRELESS”,"“Just that. Their transmitters are all right, but their receivers are"
6810,“WIRELESS”,"out of order, so they only get a dot here and a dash there. Nothing"
6811,“WIRELESS”,clear.”
6812,“WIRELESS”,
6813,“WIRELESS”,“Why is that?”
6814,“WIRELESS”,
6815,“WIRELESS”,“God knows—and Science will know to-morrow. Perhaps the induction is
6816,“WIRELESS”,faulty; perhaps the receivers aren’t tuned to receive just the number
6817,“WIRELESS”,of vibrations per second that the transmitter sends. Only a word here
6818,“WIRELESS”,and there. Just enough to tantalise.”
6819,“WIRELESS”,
6820,“WIRELESS”,Again the Morse sprang to life.
6821,“WIRELESS”,
6822,“WIRELESS”,“That’s one of ’em complaining now. Listen: ‘_Disheartening—most
6823,“WIRELESS”,disheartening_.’ It’s quite pathetic. Have you ever seen a
6824,“WIRELESS”,spiritualistic seance? It reminds me of that sometimes—odds and ends of
6825,“WIRELESS”,messages coming out of nowhere—a word here and there—no good at all.”
6826,“WIRELESS”,
6827,“WIRELESS”,"“But mediums are all impostors,” said Mr. Shaynor, in the doorway,"
6828,“WIRELESS”,lighting an asthma-cigarette. “They only do it for the money they can
6829,“WIRELESS”,make. I’ve seen ’em.”
6830,“WIRELESS”,
6831,“WIRELESS”,"“Here’s Poole, at last—clear as a bell. L.L.L. _Now_ we sha’n’t be"
6832,“WIRELESS”,long.” Mr. Cashell rattled the keys merrily. “Anything you’d like to
6833,“WIRELESS”,tell ’em?”
6834,“WIRELESS”,
6835,“WIRELESS”,"“No, I don’t think so,” I said. “I’ll go home and get to bed. I’m"
6836,“WIRELESS”,feeling a little tired.”
6837,“WIRELESS”,
6838,“WIRELESS”,

6918,PART I,PART I
6919,PART I,
6920,PART I,
6921,PART I,I sat down in the club smoking-room to fill a pipe.
6922,PART I,
6923,PART I,
6924,PART I,It was entirely natural that I should be talking to “Boy” Bayley. We
6925,PART I,"had met first, twenty odd years ago, at the Indian mess of the Tyneside"
6926,PART I,"Tail-twisters. Our last meeting, I remembered, had been at the Mount"
6927,PART I,"Nelson Hotel, which was by no means India, and there we had talked half"
6928,PART I,"the night. Boy Bayley had gone up that week to the front, where I think"
6929,PART I,"he stayed a long, long time."
6930,PART I,
6931,PART I,But now he had come back.
6932,PART I,
6933,PART I,“Are you still a Tynesider?” I asked.
6934,PART I,
6935,PART I,"“I command the Imperial Guard Battalion of the old regiment, my son,”"
6936,PART I,he replied.
6937,PART I,
6938,PART I,"“Guard which? They’ve been Fusiliers since Fontenoy. Don’t pull my leg,"
6939,PART I,Boy.”
6940,PART I,
6941,PART I,"“I said Guard, not Guard-_s_. The I. G. Battalion of the Tail-twisters."
6942,PART I,Does that make it any clearer?”
6943,PART I,
6944,PART I,“Not in the least.”
6945,PART I,
6946,PART I,“Then come over to the mess and see for yourself. We aren’t a step from
6947,PART I,barracks. Keep on my right side. I’m—I’m a bit deaf on the near.”
6948,PART I,
6949,PART I,We left the club together and crossed the street to a vast four-storied
6950,PART I,"pile, which more resembled a Rowton lodging-house than a barrack. I"
6951,PART I,could see no sentry at the gates.
6952,PART I,
6953,PART I,"“There ain’t any,” said the Boy lightly. He led me into a many-tabled"
6954,PART I,restaurant full of civilians and grey-green uniforms. At one end of the
6955,PART I,"room, on a slightly raised dais, stood a big table."
6956,PART I,
6957,PART I,“Here we are! We usually lunch here and dine in mess by ourselves.
6958,PART I,These are our chaps—but what am I thinking of? You must know most of
6959,PART I,’em. Devine’s my second in command now. There’s old Luttrell—remember
6960,PART I,"him at Cherat?—Burgard, Verschoyle (you were at school with him),"
6961,PART I,"Harrison, Pigeon, and Kyd.”"
6962,PART I,
6963,PART I,"With the exception of this last I knew them all, but I could not"
6964,PART I,remember that they had all been Tynesiders.
6965,PART I,
6966,PART I,"“I’ve never seen this sort of place,” I said, looking round. “Half the"
6967,PART I,"men here are in plain clothes, and what are those women and children"
6968,PART I,doing?”
6969,PART I,
6970,PART I,"“Eating, I hope,” Boy Bayley answered. “Our canteens would never pay if"
6971,PART I,it wasn’t for the Line and Militia trade. When they were first started
6972,PART I,people looked on ’em rather as catsmeat-shops; but we got a duchess or
6973,PART I,"two to lunch in ’em, and they’ve been grossly fashionable since.”"
6974,PART I,
6975,PART I,"“So I see,” I answered. A woman of the type that shops at the Stores"
6976,PART I,came up the room looking about her. A man in the dull-grey uniform of
6977,PART I,"the corps rose up to meet her, piloted her to a place between three"
6978,PART I,"other uniforms, and there began a very merry little meal."
6979,PART I,
6980,PART I,"“I give it up,” I said. “This is guilty splendour that I don’t"
6981,PART I,understand.”
6982,PART I,
6983,PART I,"“Quite simple,” said Burgard across the table. “The barrack supplies"
6984,PART I,"breakfast, dinner, and tea on the Army scale to the Imperial Guard"
6985,PART I,(which we call I. G.) when it’s in barracks as well as to the Line and
6986,PART I,Militia. They can all invite their friends if they choose to pay for
6987,PART I,them. That’s where we make our profits. Look!”
6988,PART I,
6989,PART I,Near one of the doors were four or five tables crowded with workmen in
6990,PART I,"the raiment of their callings. They ate steadily, but found time to"
6991,PART I,jest with the uniforms about them; and when one o’clock clanged from a
6992,PART I,"big half-built block of flats across the street, filed out."
6993,PART I,
6994,PART I,"“Those,” Devine explained, “are either our Line or Militiamen, as such"
6995,PART I,entitled to the regulation whack at regulation cost. It’s cheaper than
6996,PART I,they could buy it; an’ they meet their friends too. A man’ll walk a
6997,PART I,mile in his dinner hour to mess with his own lot.”
6998,PART I,
6999,PART I,"“Wait a minute,” I pleaded. “Will you tell me what those plumbers and"
7000,PART I,plasterers and bricklayers that I saw go out just now have to do with
7001,PART I,what I was taught to call the Line?”
7002,PART I,
7003,PART I,"“Tell him,” said the Boy over his shoulder to Burgard. He was busy"
7004,PART I,"talking with the large Verschoyle, my old schoolmate."
7005,PART I,
7006,PART I,“The Line comes next to the Guard. The Linesman’s generally a town-bird
7007,PART I,who can’t afford to be a Volunteer. He has to go into camp in an Area
7008,PART I,"for two months his first year, six weeks his second, and a month the"
7009,PART I,third. He gets about five bob a week the year round for that and for
7010,PART I,"being on duty two days of the week, and for being liable to be ordered"
7011,PART I,out to help the Guard in a row. He needn’t live in barracks unless he
7012,PART I,"wants to, and he and his family can feed at the regimental canteen at"
7013,PART I,usual rates. The women like it.”
7014,PART I,
7015,PART I,"“All this,” I said politely, but intensely, “is the raving of delirium."
7016,PART I,Where may your precious recruit who needn’t live in barracks learn his
7017,PART I,drill?”
7018,PART I,
7019,PART I,"“At his precious school, my child, like the rest of us. The notion of"
7020,PART I,allowing a human being to reach his twentieth year before asking him to
7021,PART I,put his feet in the first position _was_ raving lunacy if you like!”
7022,PART I,Boy Bayley dived back into the conversation.
7023,PART I,
7024,PART I,"“Very good,” I said meekly. “I accept the virtuous plumber who puts in"
7025,PART I,two months of his valuable time at Aldershot——”
7026,PART I,
7027,PART I,“Aldershot!” The table exploded. I felt a little annoyed.
7028,PART I,
7029,PART I,"“A camp in an Area is not exactly Aldershot,” said Burgard. “The Line"
7030,PART I,isn’t exactly what you fancy. Some of them even come to _us_!”
7031,PART I,
7032,PART I,“You recruit from ’em?”
7033,PART I,
7034,PART I,"“I beg your pardon,” said Devine with mock solemnity. “The Guard"
7035,PART I,doesn’t recruit. It selects.”
7036,PART I,
7037,PART I,"“It would,” I said, “with a Spiers and Pond restaurant; pretty girls to"
7038,PART I,play with; and——”
7039,PART I,
7040,PART I,"“A room apiece, four bob a day and all found,” said Verschoyle. “Don’t"
7041,PART I,forget that.”
7042,PART I,
7043,PART I,“Of course!” I said. “It probably beats off recruits with a club.”
7044,PART I,
7045,PART I,"“No, with the ballot-box,” said Verschoyle, laughing. “At least in all"
7046,PART I,R.C. companies.”
7047,PART I,
7048,PART I,"“I didn’t know Roman Catholics were so particular,” I ventured."
7049,PART I,
7050,PART I,"They grinned. “R.C. companies,” said the Boy, “mean Right of Choice."
7051,PART I,"When a company has been very good and pious for a long time it may, if"
7052,PART I,"the C.O. thinks fit, choose its own men—all same one-piecee club. All"
7053,PART I,"our companies are R.C.’s, and as the battalion is making up a few"
7054,PART I,vacancies ere starting once more on the wild and trackless ‘heef’ into
7055,PART I,"the Areas, the Linesman is here in force to-day sucking up to our"
7056,PART I,non-coms.”
7057,PART I,
7058,PART I,“Would some one mind explaining to me the meaning of every other word
7059,PART I,"you’ve used,” I said. “What’s a trackless ‘heef’? What’s an Area?"
7060,PART I,What’s everything generally?” I asked.
7061,PART I,
7062,PART I,"“Oh, ‘heef’s’ part of the British Constitution,” said the Boy. “It"
7063,PART I,began long ago when they’d first mapped out the big military
7064,PART I,manoeuvring grounds—we call ’em Areas for short—where the I. G. spend
7065,PART I,two-thirds of their time and the other regiments get their training. It
7066,PART I,"was slang originally for beef on the hoof, because in the Military"
7067,PART I,Areas two-thirds of your meat-rations at least are handed over to you
7068,PART I,"on the hoof, and you make your own arrangements. The word ‘heef’ became"
7069,PART I,a parable for camping in the Military Areas and all its miseries. There
7070,PART I,"are two Areas in Ireland, one in Wales for hill-work, a couple in"
7071,PART I,"Scotland, and a sort of parade-ground in the Lake District; but the"
7072,PART I,"real working Areas are in India, Africa, and Australia, and so on.”"
7073,PART I,
7074,PART I,“And what do you do there?”
7075,PART I,
7076,PART I,"“We ‘heef’ under service conditions, which are rather like hard work."
7077,PART I,"We ‘heef’ in an English Area for about a year, coming into barracks for"
7078,PART I,one month to make up wastage. Then we may ‘heef’ foreign for another
7079,PART I,year or eighteen months. Then we do sea-time in the war boats——”
7080,PART I,
7081,PART I,“_What-t?_” I said.
7082,PART I,
7083,PART I,"“Sea-time,” Bayley repeated. “Just like Marines, to learn about the big"
7084,PART I,guns and how to embark and disembark quick. Then we come back to our
7085,PART I,"territorial headquarters for six months, to educate the Line and"
7086,PART I,"Volunteer camps, to go to Hythe, to keep abreast of any new ideas, and"
7087,PART I,then we fill up vacancies. We call those six months ‘Schools.’ Then we
7088,PART I,"begin all over again, thus: Home ‘heef,’ foreign ‘heef,’ sea-time,"
7089,PART I,"schools. ‘Heefing’ isn’t precisely luxurious, but it’s on ‘heef’ that"
7090,PART I,we make our head-money.”
7091,PART I,
7092,PART I,"“Or lose it,” said the sallow Pigeon, and all laughed, as men will, at"
7093,PART I,regimental jokes.
7094,PART I,
7095,PART I,"“The Dove never lets me forget that,” said Boy Bayley. “It happened"
7096,PART I,last March. We were out in the Second Northern Area at the top end of
7097,PART I,Scotland where a lot of those silly deer forests used to be. I’d sooner
7098,PART I,"‘heef’ in the middle of Australia myself—or Athabasca, with all respect"
7099,PART I,to the Dove—he’s a native of those parts. We were camped somewhere near
7100,PART I,"Caithness, and the Armity (that’s the combined Navy and Army board that"
7101,PART I,runs our show) sent us about eight hundred raw remounts to break in to
7102,PART I,keep us warm.”
7103,PART I,
7104,PART I,“Why horses for a foot regiment?”
7105,PART I,
7106,PART I,“I. G.’s don’t foot it unless they’re obliged to. No have gee-gee how
7107,PART I,"can move? I’ll show you later. Well, as I was saying, we broke those"
7108,PART I,"beasts in on compressed forage and small box-spurs, and then we started"
7109,PART I,across Scotland to Applecross to hand ’em over to a horse-depot there.
7110,PART I,"It was snowing cruel, and we didn’t know the country overmuch. You"
7111,PART I,remember the 30th—the old East Lancashire—at Mian Mir?
7112,PART I,
7113,PART I,“Their Guard Battalion had been ‘heefing’ round those parts for six
7114,PART I,"months. We thought they’d be snowed up all quiet and comfy, but Burden,"
7115,PART I,"their C. O., got wind of our coming, and sent spies in to Eschol.”"
7116,PART I,
7117,PART I,"“Confound him,” said Luttrell, who was fat and well-liking. “I"
7118,PART I,entertained one of ’em—in a red worsted comforter—under Bean Derig. He
7119,PART I,said he was a crofter. ‘Gave him a drink too.”
7120,PART I,
7121,PART I,"“I don’t mind admitting,” said the Boy, “that, what with the cold and"
7122,PART I,"the remounts, we were moving rather base over apex. Burden bottled us"
7123,PART I,"under Sghurr Mohr in a snowstorm. He stampeded half the horses, cut off"
7124,PART I,"a lot of us in a snow-bank, and generally rubbed our noses in the"
7125,PART I,dirt.”
7126,PART I,
7127,PART I,“Was he allowed to do that?” I said.
7128,PART I,
7129,PART I,“There is no peace in a Military Area. If we’d beaten him off or got
7130,PART I,"away without losing anyone, we’d have been entitled to a day’s pay from"
7131,PART I,"every man engaged against us. But we didn’t. He cut off fifty of ours,"
7132,PART I,"held ’em as prisoners for the regulation three days, and then sent in"
7133,PART I,his bill—three days’ pay for each man taken. Fifty men at twelve bob a
7134,PART I,"head, plus five pounds for the Dove as a captured officer, and Kyd"
7135,PART I,"here, his junior, three, made about forty quid to Burden & Co. They"
7136,PART I,crowed over us horrid.”
7137,PART I,
7138,PART I,“Couldn’t you have appealed to an umpire or—or something?”
7139,PART I,
7140,PART I,"“We could, but we talked it over with the men and decided to pay and"
7141,PART I,look happy. We were fairly had. The 30th knew every foot of Sghurr
7142,PART I,"Mohr. I spent three days huntin’ ’em in the snow, but they went off on"
7143,PART I,our remounts about twenty mile that night.”
7144,PART I,
7145,PART I,“Do you always do this sham-fight business?” I asked.
7146,PART I,
7147,PART I,“Once inside an Area you must look after yourself; but I tell you that
7148,PART I,a fight which means that every man-Jack of us may lose a week’s pay
7149,PART I,"isn’t so damn-sham after all. It keeps the men nippy. Still, in the"
7150,PART I,"long run, it’s like whist on a P. & O. It comes out fairly level if you"
7151,PART I,"play long enough. Now and again, though, one gets a present—say, when a"
7152,PART I,"Line regiment’s out on the ‘heef,’ and signifies that it’s ready to"
7153,PART I,abide by the rules of the game. You mustn’t take head-money from a Line
7154,PART I,"regiment in an Area unless it says that it’ll play you; but, after a"
7155,PART I,"week or two, those clever Linesmen always think they see a chance of"
7156,PART I,"making a pot, and send in their compliments to the nearest I. G. Then"
7157,PART I,the fun begins. We caught a Line regiment single-handed about two years
7158,PART I,ago in Ireland—caught it on the hop between a bog and a beach. It had
7159,PART I,"just moved in to join its brigade, and we made a forty-two mile march"
7160,PART I,"in fourteen hours, and cut it off, lock, stock, and barrel. It went to"
7161,PART I,ground like a badger—I _will_ say those Line regiments can dig—but we
7162,PART I,got out privily by night and broke up the only road it could expect to
7163,PART I,get its baggage and company-guns along. Then we blew up a bridge that
7164,PART I,some Sappers had made for experimental purposes (_they_ were rather
7165,PART I,"stuffy about it) on its line of retreat, while we lay up in the"
7166,PART I,mountains and signalled for the A.C. of those parts.”
7167,PART I,
7168,PART I,“Who’s an A.C.?” I asked.
7169,PART I,
7170,PART I,“The Adjustment Committee—the umpires of the Military Areas. They’re a
7171,PART I,"set of superannuated old aunts of colonels kept for the purpose, but"
7172,PART I,"they occasionally combine to do justice. Our A.C. came, saw our"
7173,PART I,"dispositions, and said it was a sanguinary massacre for the Line, and"
7174,PART I,that we were entitled to our full pound of flesh—head-money for one
7175,PART I,"whole regiment, with equipment, four company-guns, and all kit! At Line"
7176,PART I,rates this worked out as one fat cheque for two hundred and fifty. Not
7177,PART I,bad!”
7178,PART I,
7179,PART I,“But we had to pay the Sappers seventy-four quid for blowing their
7180,PART I,"patent bridge to pieces,” Devine interpolated. “That was a swindle.”"
7181,PART I,
7182,PART I,"“That’s true,” the Boy went on, “but the Adjustment Committee gave our"
7183,PART I,helpless victims a talking to that was worth another hundred to hear.”
7184,PART I,
7185,PART I,“But isn’t there a lot of unfairness in this head-money system?” I
7186,PART I,asked.
7187,PART I,
7188,PART I,"“Can’t have everything perfect,” said the Boy. “Head-money is an"
7189,PART I,"attempt at payment by results, and it gives the men a direct interest"
7190,PART I,"in their job. Three times out of five, of course, the A. C. will"
7191,PART I,"disallow both sides’ claim, but there’s always the chance of bringing"
7192,PART I,off a coup.”
7193,PART I,
7194,PART I,“Do all regiments do it?”
7195,PART I,
7196,PART I,"“Heavily. The Line pays a bob per prisoner and the Militia ninepence,"
7197,PART I,not to mention side-bets which are what really keep the men keen. It
7198,PART I,"isn’t supposed to be done by the Volunteers, but they gamble worse than"
7199,PART I,"anyone. Why, the very kids do it when they go to First Camp at"
7200,PART I,Aldershot or Salisbury.”
7201,PART I,
7202,PART I,"“Head-money’s a national institution—like betting,” said Burgard."
7203,PART I,
7204,PART I,"“I should say it was,” said Pigeon suddenly. “I was roped in the other"
7205,PART I,day as an Adjustment Committee by the Kemptown Board School. I was
7206,PART I,"riding under the Brighton racecourse, and I heard the whistle goin’ for"
7207,PART I,"umpire—the regulation, two longs and two shorts. I didn’t take any"
7208,PART I,notice till an infant about a yard high jumped up from a furze-patch
7209,PART I,and shouted: ‘Guard! Guard! Come ’ere! I want you _per_fessionally. Alf
7210,PART I,says ’e ain’t outflanked. Ain’t ’e a liar? Come an’ look ’ow I’ve
7211,PART I,posted my men.’ You bet I looked. The young demon trotted by my stirrup
7212,PART I,and showed me his whole army (twenty of ’em) laid out under cover as
7213,PART I,nicely as you please round a cowhouse in a hollow. He kept on shouting:
7214,PART I,‘I’ve drew Alf into there. ’Is persition ain’t tenable. Say it ain’t
7215,PART I,"tenable, Guard!’ I rode round the position, and Alf with his army came"
7216,PART I,out of his cowhouse an’ sat on the roof and protested like a—like a
7217,PART I,Militia Colonel; but the facts were in favour of my friend and I
7218,PART I,"umpired according. Well, Alf abode by my decision. I explained it to"
7219,PART I,"him at length, and he solemnly paid up his head-money—farthing points"
7220,PART I,if you please.”
7221,PART I,
7222,PART I,“Did they pay you umpire’s fee?” said Kyd. “I umpired a whole afternoon
7223,PART I,"once for a village school at home, and they stood me a bottle of hot"
7224,PART I,ginger beer.”
7225,PART I,
7226,PART I,“I compromised on a halfpenny—a sticky one—or I’d have hurt their
7227,PART I,"feelings,” said Pigeon gravely. “But I gave ’em sixpence back.”"
7228,PART I,
7229,PART I,“How were they manoeuvring and what with?” I asked.
7230,PART I,
7231,PART I,"“Oh, by whistle and hand-signal. They had the dummy Board School guns"
7232,PART I,"and flags for positions, but they were rushing their attack much too"
7233,PART I,"quick for that open country. I told ’em so, and they admitted it.”"
7234,PART I,
7235,PART I,“But who taught ’em?” I said.
7236,PART I,
7237,PART I,"“They had learned in their schools, of course, like the rest of us."
7238,PART I,They were all of ’em over ten; and squad-drill begins when they’re
7239,PART I,eight. They knew their company-drill a heap better than they knew their
7240,PART I,King’s English.”
7241,PART I,
7242,PART I,“How much drill do the boys put in?” I asked.
7243,PART I,
7244,PART I,“All boys begin physical drill to music in the Board Schools when
7245,PART I,"they’re six; squad-drill, one hour a week, when they’re eight;"
7246,PART I,"company-drill when they’re ten, for an hour and a half a week. Between"
7247,PART I,ten and twelve they get battalion drill of a sort. They take the rifle
7248,PART I,at twelve and record their first target-score at thirteen. That’s what
7249,PART I,the Code lays down. But it’s worked very loosely so long as a boy comes
7250,PART I,up to the standard of his age.”
7251,PART I,
7252,PART I,"“In Canada we don’t need your physical drill. We’re born fit,” said"
7253,PART I,"Pigeon, “and our ten-year-olds could knock spots out of your"
7254,PART I,twelve-year-olds.”
7255,PART I,
7256,PART I,"“I may as well explain,” said the Boy, “that the Dove is our ‘swop’"
7257,PART I,officer. He’s an untamed Huskie from Nootka Sound when he’s at home. An
7258,PART I,I. G. Corps exchanges one officer every two years with a Canadian or
7259,PART I,"Australian or African Guard Corps. We’ve had a year of our Dove, an’ we"
7260,PART I,"shall be sorry to lose him. He humbles our insular pride. Meantime,"
7261,PART I,"Morten, our ‘swop’ in Canada, keeps the ferocious Canuck humble. When"
7262,PART I,"Pij. goes we shall swop Kyd, who’s next on the roster, for a Cornstalk"
7263,PART I,or a Maori. But about the education-drill. A boy can’t attend First
7264,PART I,"Camp, as we call it, till he is a trained boy and holds his First"
7265,PART I,"Musketry certificate. The Education Code says he must be fourteen, and"
7266,PART I,"the boys usually go to First Camp at about that age. Of course, they’ve"
7267,PART I,been to their little private camps and Boys’ Fresh Air Camps and public
7268,PART I,"school picnics while they were at school, but First Camp is where the"
7269,PART I,young drafts all meet—generally at Aldershot in this part of the world.
7270,PART I,"First Camp lasts a week or ten days, and the boys are looked over for"
7271,PART I,vaccination and worked lightly in brigades with lots of blank
7272,PART I,cartridge. Second Camp—that’s for the fifteen to
7273,PART I,"eighteen-year-olds—lasts ten days or a fortnight, and that includes a"
7274,PART I,final medical examination. Men don’t like to be chucked out on medical
7275,PART I,"certificates much—nowadays. I assure you Second Camp, at Salisbury,"
7276,PART I,"say, is an experience for a young I. G. officer. We’re told off to ’em"
7277,PART I,in rotation. A wilderness of monkeys isn’t in it. The kids are apt to
7278,PART I,"think ’emselves soldiers, and we have to take the edge off ’em with"
7279,PART I,lots of picquet-work and night attacks.”
7280,PART I,
7281,PART I,“And what happens after Second Camp?”
7282,PART I,
7283,PART I,"“It’s hard to explain. Our system is so illogical. Theoretically, the"
7284,PART I,boys needn’t show up for the next three or four years after Second
7285,PART I,"Camp. They are supposed to be making their way in life. Actually, the"
7286,PART I,young doctor or lawyer or engineer joins a Volunteer battalion that
7287,PART I,sticks to the minimum of camp—ten days per annum. That gives him a
7288,PART I,"holiday in the open air, and now that men have taken to endowing their"
7289,PART I,"Volunteer drill-halls with baths and libraries, he finds, if he can’t"
7290,PART I,"run to a club, that his own drill-hall is an efficient substitute. He"
7291,PART I,"meets men there who’ll be useful to him later, and he keeps himself in"
7292,PART I,touch with what’s going on while he’s studying for his profession. The
7293,PART I,"town-birds—such as the chemist’s assistant, clerk, plumber, mechanic,"
7294,PART I,"electrician, and so forth—generally put in for their town Volunteer"
7295,PART I,corps as soon as they begin to walk out with the girls. They like
7296,PART I,takin’ their true-loves to our restaurants. Look yonder!” I followed
7297,PART I,"his gaze, and saw across the room a man and a maid at a far table,"
7298,PART I,forgetting in each other’s eyes the good food on their plates.
7299,PART I,
7300,PART I,"“So it is,” said I. “Go ahead.”"
7301,PART I,
7302,PART I,"“Then, too, we have some town Volunteer corps that lay themselves out"
7303,PART I,"to attract promising youths of nineteen or twenty, and make much of ’em"
7304,PART I,on condition that they join their Line battalion and play for their
7305,PART I,county. Under the new county qualifications—birth or three years’
7306,PART I,"residence—that means a great deal in League matches, and the same in"
7307,PART I,County cricket.”
7308,PART I,
7309,PART I,"“By Jove, that’s a good notion,” I cried. “Who invented it?”"
7310,PART I,
7311,PART I,"“C. B. Fry—long ago. He said in his paper, that County cricket and"
7312,PART I,County volunteering ought to be on the same footing—unpaid and genuine.
7313,PART I,‘No cricketer no corps. No corps no cricketer’ was his watchword. There
7314,PART I,"was a row among the pro’s at first, but C. B. won, and later the League"
7315,PART I,had to come in. They said at first it would ruin the gate; but when
7316,PART I,"County matches began to be _pukka_ county, _plus_ inter-regimental,"
7317,PART I,"affairs the gate trebled, and as two-thirds of the gate goes to the"
7318,PART I,regiments supplying the teams some Volunteer corps fairly wallow in
7319,PART I,"cash. It’s all unofficial, of course, but League Corps, as they call"
7320,PART I,"’em, can take their pick of the Second Camper. Some corps ask ten"
7321,PART I,"guineas entrance-fee, and get it too, from the young bloods that want"
7322,PART I,"to shine in the arena. I told you we catered for all tastes. Now, as"
7323,PART I,"regards the Line proper, I believe the young artisan and mechanic puts"
7324,PART I,in for that before he marries. He likes the two-months’ ‘heef’ in his
7325,PART I,"first year, and five bob a week is something to go on with between"
7326,PART I,times.”
7327,PART I,
7328,PART I,“Do they follow their trade while they’re in the Line?” I demanded.
7329,PART I,
7330,PART I,“Why not? How many well-paid artisans work more than four days a week
7331,PART I,anyhow? Remember a Linesman hasn’t to be drilled in your sense of the
7332,PART I,"word. He must have had at least eight years’ grounding in that, as well"
7333,PART I,as two or three years in his Volunteer battalion. He can sleep where he
7334,PART I,"pleases. He can’t leave town-limits without reporting himself, of"
7335,PART I,"course, but he can get leave if he wants it. He’s on duty two days in"
7336,PART I,"the week as a rule, and he’s liable to be invited out for garrison duty"
7337,PART I,"down the Mediterranean, but his benefit societies will insure him"
7338,PART I,against that. I’ll tell you about that later. If it’s a hard winter and
7339,PART I,"trade’s slack, a lot of the bachelors are taken into the I. G. barracks"
7340,PART I,"(while the I. G. is out on the heef) for theoretical instruction. Oh, I"
7341,PART I,assure you the Line hasn’t half a bad time of it.”
7342,PART I,
7343,PART I,“Amazing!” I murmured. “And what about the others?”
7344,PART I,
7345,PART I,“The Volunteers? Observe the beauty of our system. We’re a free people.
7346,PART I,We get up and slay the man who says we aren’t. But as a little detail
7347,PART I,"we never mention, if we don’t volunteer in some corps or another—as"
7348,PART I,"combatants if we’re fit, as non-combatants, if we ain’t—till we’re"
7349,PART I,"thirty-five we don’t vote, and we don’t get poor-relief, and the women"
7350,PART I,don’t love us.”
7351,PART I,
7352,PART I,"“Oh, that’s the compulsion of it?” said I."
7353,PART I,
7354,PART I,"Bayley inclined his head gravely. “That, Sir, is the compulsion. We"
7355,PART I,"voted the legal part of it ourselves in a fit of panic, and we have not"
7356,PART I,yet rescinded our resolution. The women attend to the unofficial
7357,PART I,penalties. But being free British citizens——”
7358,PART I,
7359,PART I,"“_And_ snobs,” put in Pigeon. “The point is well taken, Pij———we have"
7360,PART I,supplied ourselves with every sort and shape and make of Volunteer
7361,PART I,"corps that you can imagine, and we’ve mixed the whole show up with our"
7362,PART I,"Odd Fellows and our I.O.G.T.’s and our Buffaloes, and our Burkes and"
7363,PART I,"our Debretts, not to mention Leagues and Athletic Clubs, till you can’t"
7364,PART I,tell t’other from which. You remember the young pup who used to look on
7365,PART I,"soldiering as a favour done to his ungrateful country—the gun-poking,"
7366,PART I,"ferret-pettin’, landed gentleman’s offspring—the suckin’ Facey Romford?"
7367,PART I,"Well, he generally joins a Foreign Service Corps when he leaves"
7368,PART I,college.”
7369,PART I,
7370,PART I,"“Can Volunteers go foreign, then?”"
7371,PART I,
7372,PART I,"“Can’t they just, if their C.O. _or_ his wife has influence! The Armity"
7373,PART I,will always send a well-connected F.S. corps out to help a guard
7374,PART I,battalion in a small campaign. Otherwise F.S. corps make their own
7375,PART I,"arrangements about camps. You see, the Military Areas are always open."
7376,PART I,They can ‘heef’ there (and gamble on head-money) as long as their
7377,PART I,finances run to it; or they can apply to do sea-time in the ships. It’s
7378,PART I,"a cheap way for a young man to see the world, and if he’s any good he"
7379,PART I,can try to get into the Guard later.”
7380,PART I,
7381,PART I,"“The main point,” said Pigeon, “is that F.S. corps are ‘swagger’—the"
7382,PART I,"correct thing. It ’ud never do to be drawn for the Militia, don’t you"
7383,PART I,"know,” he drawled, trying to render the English voice."
7384,PART I,
7385,PART I,"“That’s what happens to a chap who doesn’t volunteer,” said Bayley."
7386,PART I,"“Well, after the F.S. corps (we’ve about forty of ’em) come our"
7387,PART I,"territorial Volunteer battalions, and a man who can’t suit himself"
7388,PART I,somewhere among ’em must be a shade difficult. We’ve got those ‘League’
7389,PART I,corps I was talking about; and those studious corps that just scrape
7390,PART I,through their ten days’ camp; and we’ve crack corps of highly-paid
7391,PART I,mechanics who can afford a two months’ ‘heef’ in an interesting Area
7392,PART I,every other year; and we’ve senior and junior scientific corps of
7393,PART I,earnest boilermakers and fitters and engineers who read papers on high
7394,PART I,"explosives, and do their ‘heefing’ in a wet"
7395,PART I,picket-boat—mine-droppin’—at the ports. Then we’ve heavy
7396,PART I,artillery—recruited from the big manufacturing towns and ship-building
7397,PART I,"yards—and ferocious hard-ridin’ Yeomanry (they _can_ ride—now),"
7398,PART I,"genteel, semi-genteel, and Hooligan corps, and so on and so forth till"
7399,PART I,you come to the Home Defence Establishment—the young chaps knocked out
7400,PART I,"under medical certificate at the Second Camp, but good enough to sit"
7401,PART I,"behind hedges or clean up camp, and the old was-birds who’ve served"
7402,PART I,their time but don’t care to drop out of the fun of the yearly camps
7403,PART I,and the halls. They call ’emselves veterans and do fancy-shooting at
7404,PART I,"Bisley, but, between you and me, they’re mostly Fresh Air Benefit"
7405,PART I,Clubs. They contribute to the Volunteer journals and tell the Guard
7406,PART I,that it’s no good. But I like ’em. I shall be one of ’em some day—a
7407,PART I,copper-nosed was-bird! … So you see we’re mixed to a degree on the
7408,PART I,Volunteer side.”
7409,PART I,
7410,PART I,"“It sounds that way,” I ventured."
7411,PART I,
7412,PART I,"“You’ve overdone it, Bayley,” said Devine. “You’ve missed our one"
7413,PART I,strong point.” He turned to me and continued: “It’s embarkation. The
7414,PART I,"Volunteers may be as mixed as the Colonel says, but they _are_ trained"
7415,PART I,to go down to the sea in ships. You ought to see a big Bank-Holiday
7416,PART I,roll-out. We suspend most of the usual railway traffic and turn on the
7417,PART I,military time-table—say on Friday at midnight. By 4 A.M. the trains are
7418,PART I,running from every big centre in England to the nearest port at
7419,PART I,"two-minute intervals. As a rule, the Armity meets us at the other end"
7420,PART I,with shipping of sorts—fleet reserves or regular men of war or
7421,PART I,hulks—anything you can stick a gang-plank to. We pile the men on to the
7422,PART I,"troop-decks, stack the rifles in the racks, send down the sea-kit,"
7423,PART I,"steam about for a few hours, and land ’em somewhere. It’s a good"
7424,PART I,"notion, because our army to be any use _must_ be an army of"
7425,PART I,"embarkation. Why, last Whit Monday we had—how many were down at the"
7426,PART I,"dock-edge in the first eight hours? Kyd, you’re the Volunteer"
7427,PART I,enthusiast last from school.”
7428,PART I,
7429,PART I,"“In the first ten hours over a hundred and eighteen thousand,” said Kyd"
7430,PART I,"across the table, “with thirty-six thousand actually put in and taken"
7431,PART I,out of ship. In the whole thirty-six hours we had close on ninety
7432,PART I,thousand men on the water and a hundred and thirty-three thousand on
7433,PART I,the quays fallen in with their sea-kit.”
7434,PART I,
7435,PART I,"“That must have been a sight,” I said."
7436,PART I,
7437,PART I,"“One didn’t notice it much. It was scattered between Chatham, Dover,"
7438,PART I,"Portsmouth, Plymouth, Bristol, Liverpool, and so on, merely to give the"
7439,PART I,inland men a chance to get rid of their breakfasts. We don’t like to
7440,PART I,concentrate and try a big embarkation at any one point. It makes the
7441,PART I,"Continent jumpy. Otherwise,” said Kyd, “I believe we could get two"
7442,PART I,"hundred thousand men, with their kits, away on one tide.”"
7443,PART I,
7444,PART I,“What d’you want with so many?” I asked.
7445,PART I,
7446,PART I,"“_We_ don’t want one of ’em; but the Continent used to point out, every"
7447,PART I,"time relations were strained, that nothing would be easier than to raid"
7448,PART I,England if they got command of the sea for a week. After a few years
7449,PART I,"some genius discovered that it cut both ways, an’ there was no reason"
7450,PART I,"why we, who are supposed to command the sea and own a few ships, should"
7451,PART I,not organise our little raids in case of need. The notion caught on
7452,PART I,among the Volunteers—they were getting rather sick of manœuvres on dry
7453,PART I,land—and since then we haven’t heard so much about raids from the
7454,PART I,"Continent,” said Bayley."
7455,PART I,
7456,PART I,"“It’s the offensive-defensive,” said Verschoyle, “that they talk so"
7457,PART I,much about. We learned it _all_ from the Continent—bless ’em! They
7458,PART I,insisted on it so.”
7459,PART I,
7460,PART I,"“No, we learned it from the Fleet,” said Devine. “The Mediterranean"
7461,PART I,"Fleet landed ten thousand marines and sailors, with guns, in twenty"
7462,PART I,minutes once at manœuvres. That was long ago. I’ve seen the Fleet
7463,PART I,"Reserve and a few paddle-steamers, hired for the day, land twenty-five"
7464,PART I,thousand Volunteers at Bantry in four hours—half the men sea-sick too.
7465,PART I,You’ve no notion what a difference that sort of manœuvre makes in the
7466,PART I,calculations of our friends on the mainland. The Continent knows what
7467,PART I,invasion means. It’s like dealing with a man whose nerve has been
7468,PART I,"shaken. It doesn’t cost much after all, and it makes us better friends"
7469,PART I,with the great European family. We’re now as thick as thieves.”
7470,PART I,
7471,PART I,“Where does the Imperial Guard come in in all this gorgeousness?” I
7472,PART I,asked. “You’re unusual modest about yourselves.”
7473,PART I,
7474,PART I,"“As a matter of fact, we’re supposed to go out and stay out. We’re the"
7475,PART I,permanently mobilised lot. I don’t think there are more than eight I.
7476,PART I,G. battalions in England now. We’re a hundred battalions all told.
7477,PART I,"Mostly on the ‘heef’ in India, Africa and so forth.”"
7478,PART I,
7479,PART I,“A hundred thousand. Isn’t that small allowance?” I suggested.
7480,PART I,
7481,PART I,"“You think so? One hundred thousand _men_, without a single case of"
7482,PART I,"venereal, and an average sick list of two per cent, permanently on a"
7483,PART I,"war footing? Well, perhaps you’re right, but it’s a useful little force"
7484,PART I,to begin with while the others are getting ready. There’s the native
7485,PART I,"Indian Army also, which isn’t a broken reed, and, since ‘no Volunteer"
7486,PART I,"no Vote’ is the rule throughout the Empire, you will find a few men in"
7487,PART I,"Canada, Australia, and elsewhere, that are fairly hefty in their"
7488,PART I,class.”
7489,PART I,
7490,PART I,"“But a hundred thousand isn’t enough for garrison duty,” I persisted."
7491,PART I,
7492,PART I,"“A hundred thousand _sound_ men, not sick boys, go quite a way,” said"
7493,PART I,Pigeon.
7494,PART I,
7495,PART I,“We expect the Line to garrison the Mediterranean Ports and
7496,PART I,"thereabouts,” said Bayley. “Don’t sneer at the mechanic. He’s deuced"
7497,PART I,"good stuff. He isn’t rudely ordered out, because this ain’t a military"
7498,PART I,"despotism, and we have to consider people’s feelings. The Armity"
7499,PART I,"usually brackets three Line regiments together, and calls for men for"
7500,PART I,"six months or a year for Malta, Gib, or elsewhere, at a bob a day."
7501,PART I,Three battalions will give you nearly a whole battalion of bachelors
7502,PART I,between ’em. You fill up deficiencies with a call on the territorial
7503,PART I,"Volunteer battalion, and away you go with what we call a Ports"
7504,PART I,"battalion. What’s astonishing in that? Remember that in this country,"
7505,PART I,where fifty per cent of the able-bodied males have got a pretty fair
7506,PART I,"notion of soldiering, and, which is more, have all camped out in the"
7507,PART I,"open, you wake up the spirit of adventure in the young.”"
7508,PART I,
7509,PART I,"“Not much adventure at Malta, Gib, or Cyprus,” I retorted. “Don’t they"
7510,PART I,get sick of it?”
7511,PART I,
7512,PART I,“But you don’t realise that we treat ’em rather differently from the
7513,PART I,soldier of the past. You ought to go and see a Ports battalion drawn
7514,PART I,from a manufacturing centre growin’ vines in Cyprus in its shirt
7515,PART I,"sleeves; and at Gib, and Malta, of course, the battalions are working"
7516,PART I,with the Fleet half the time.”
7517,PART I,
7518,PART I,"“It seems to me,” I said angrily, “you are knocking _esprit de corps_"
7519,PART I,on the head with all this Army-Navy jumble. It’s as bad as——”
7520,PART I,
7521,PART I,“I know what you’re going to say. As bad as what Kitchener used to do
7522,PART I,when he believed that a thousand details picked up on the veldt were as
7523,PART I,"good as a column of two regiments. In the old days, when drill was a"
7524,PART I,"sort of holy sacred art learned in old age, you’d be quite right. But"
7525,PART I,"remember _our_ chaps are broke to drill from childhood, and the theory"
7526,PART I,we work on is that a thousand trained Englishmen ought to be about as
7527,PART I,good as another thousand trained Englishmen. We’ve enlarged our
7528,PART I,"horizon, that’s all. Some day the Army and the Navy will be"
7529,PART I,interchangeable.”
7530,PART I,
7531,PART I,"“You’ve enlarged it enough to fall out of, I think. Now where in all"
7532,PART I,this mess of compulsory Volunteers——?”
7533,PART I,
7534,PART I,"“My dear boy, there’s no compulsion. You’ve _got_ to be drilled when"
7535,PART I,"you’re a child, same as you’ve got to learn to read, and if you don’t"
7536,PART I,pretend to serve in some corps or other till you’re thirty-five or
7537,PART I,"medically chucked you rank with lunatics, women, and minors. That’s"
7538,PART I,fair enough.”
7539,PART I,
7540,PART I,"“Compulsory conscripts,” I continued. “Where, as I was going to say,"
7541,PART I,does the Militia come in?”
7542,PART I,
7543,PART I,“As I have said—for the men who can’t afford volunteering. The Militia
7544,PART I,is recruited by ballot—pretty comprehensively too. Volunteers are
7545,PART I,"exempt, but most men not otherwise accounted for are bagged by the"
7546,PART I,Militia. They have to put in a minimum three weeks’ camp every other
7547,PART I,"year, and they get fifteen bob a week and their keep when they’re at"
7548,PART I,"it, and some sort of a yearly fee, I’ve forgotten how much. ’Tisn’t a"
7549,PART I,"showy service, but it’s very useful. It keeps the mass of the men"
7550,PART I,"between twenty-five, say, and thirty-five moderately fit, and gives the"
7551,PART I,Armity an excuse for having more equipment ready—in case of
7552,PART I,emergencies.”
7553,PART I,
7554,PART I,"“I don’t think you’re quite fair on the Militia,” drawled Verschoyle."
7555,PART I,“They’re better than we give ’em credit for. Don’t you remember the
7556,PART I,Middle Moor Collieries’ strike?”
7557,PART I,
7558,PART I,"“Tell me,” I said quickly. Evidently the others knew."
7559,PART I,
7560,PART I,"“We-ell, it was no end of a pitman’s strike about eight years ago."
7561,PART I,"There were twenty-five thousand men involved—Militia, of course. At the"
7562,PART I,"end of the first month—October—when things were looking rather blue,"
7563,PART I,one of those clever Labour leaders got hold of the Militia Act and
7564,PART I,"discovered that any Militia regiment could, by a two-thirds vote, go on"
7565,PART I,‘heef’ in a Military Area in addition to its usual biennial camp.
7566,PART I,"Two-and-twenty battalions of Geordies solemnly applied, and they were"
7567,PART I,turned loose into the Irish and Scotch Areas under an I. G. Brigadier
7568,PART I,who had private instructions to knock clinkers out of ’em. But the
7569,PART I,pitman is a strong and agile bird. He throve on snowdrifts and
7570,PART I,entrenching and draggin’ guns through heather. _He_ was being fed and
7571,PART I,"clothed for nothing, besides having a chance of making head-money, and"
7572,PART I,his strike-pay was going clear to his wife and family. You see? Wily
7573,PART I,man. But wachtabittje! When that ‘heef’ finished in December the strike
7574,PART I,"was still on. _Then_ that same Labour leader found out, from the same"
7575,PART I,"Act, that if at any time more than thirty or forty men of a Militia"
7576,PART I,regiment wished to volunteer to do sea-time and study big guns in the
7577,PART I,"Fleet they were in no wise to be discouraged, but were to be taken on"
7578,PART I,"as opportunity offered and paid a bob a day. Accordingly, about"
7579,PART I,"January, Geordie began volunteering for sea-time—seven and eight"
7580,PART I,"hundred men out of each regiment. Anyhow, it made up seventeen thousand"
7581,PART I,men! It was a splendid chance and the Armity jumped at it. The Home and
7582,PART I,Channel Fleets and the North Sea and Cruiser Squadrons were
7583,PART I,"strengthened with lame ducks from the Fleet Reserve, and between ’em"
7584,PART I,with a little stretching and pushing they accommodated all of that
7585,PART I,young division.”
7586,PART I,
7587,PART I,"“Yes, but you’ve forgotten how we lied to the Continent about it. All"
7588,PART I,"Europe wanted to know what the dooce we were at,” said Boy Bayley, “and"
7589,PART I,the wretched Cabinet had to stump the country in the depths of winter
7590,PART I,"explaining our new system of poor-relief. I beg your pardon,"
7591,PART I,Verschoyle.”
7592,PART I,
7593,PART I,"“The Armity improvised naval manœuvres between Gib and Land’s End, with"
7594,PART I,frequent coalings and landings; ending in a cruise round England that
7595,PART I,fairly paralysed the pitmen. The first day out they wanted the fleet
7596,PART I,"stopped while they went ashore and killed their Labour leader, but they"
7597,PART I,couldn’t be obliged. Then they wanted to mutiny over the coaling—it was
7598,PART I,"too like their own job. Oh, they had a lordly time! They came back—the"
7599,PART I,combined Fleets anchored off Hull—with a nautical hitch to their
7600,PART I,breeches. They’d had a free fight at Gib with the Ports battalion
7601,PART I,there; they cleared out the town of Lagos; and they’d fought a pitched
7602,PART I,battle with the dockyard-mateys at Devonport. So they’d done ’emselves
7603,PART I,"well, but they didn’t want any more military life for a bit.”"
7604,PART I,
7605,PART I,“And the strike?”
7606,PART I,
7607,PART I,"“That ended, all right enough, when the strike-money came to an end."
7608,PART I,The pit-owners were furious. They said the Armity had wilfully
7609,PART I,"prolonged the strike, and asked questions in the House. The Armity said"
7610,PART I,that they had taken advantage of the crisis to put a six months’ polish
7611,PART I,"on fifteen thousand fine young men, and if the masters cared to come"
7612,PART I,out on the same terms they’d be happy to do the same by them.”
7613,PART I,
7614,PART I,“And then?”
7615,PART I,
7616,PART I,"“Palaver done set,” said Bayley. “Everybody laughed.”"
7617,PART I,
7618,PART I,"“I don’t quite understand about this sea-time business,” I said. “Is"
7619,PART I,the Fleet open to take any regiment aboard?”
7620,PART I,
7621,PART I,"“Rather. The I. G. must, the Line can, the Militia may, and the"
7622,PART I,"Volunteers do put in sea-time. The Coast Volunteers began it, and the"
7623,PART I,"fashion is spreading inland. Under certain circumstances, as Verschoyle"
7624,PART I,"told you, a Volunteer or Militia regiment can vote whether it ‘heefs’"
7625,PART I,"wet or dry. If it votes wet and has influence (like some F.S. corps),"
7626,PART I,it can sneak into the Channel or the Home Fleet and do a cruise round
7627,PART I,"England or to Madeira or the North Sea. The regiment, of course, is"
7628,PART I,"distributed among the ships, and the Fleet dry nurse ’em. It rather"
7629,PART I,"breaks up shore discipline, but it gives the inland men a bit of"
7630,PART I,"experience, and, of course, it gives us a fairish supply of men behind"
7631,PART I,"the gun, in event of any strain on the Fleet. Some coast corps make a"
7632,PART I,"specialty of it, and compete for embarking and disembarking records. I"
7633,PART I,believe some of the Tyneside engineerin’ corps put ten per cent of
7634,PART I,their men through the Fleet engine rooms. But there’s no need to stay
7635,PART I,talking here all the afternoon. Come and see the I. G. in his lair—the
7636,PART I,miserable conscript driven up to the colours at the point of the
7637,PART I,bayonet.”
7638,PART I,
7639,PART I,
7640,PART I,
7641,PART I,
7642,PART II,PART II
7643,PART II,
7644,PART II,
7645,PART II,"The great hall was emptying apace as the clocks struck two, and we"
7646,PART II,"passed out through double doors into a huge reading and smoking room,"
7647,PART II,blue with tobacco and buzzing with voices.
7648,PART II,
7649,PART II,"“We’re quieter as a rule,” said the Boy. “But we’re filling up"
7650,PART II,vacancies to-day. Hence the anxious faces of the Line and Militia.
7651,PART II,"Look!” There were four tables against the walls, and at each stood a"
7652,PART II,crowd of uniforms. The centres of disturbance were noncommissioned
7653,PART II,"officers who, seated, growled and wrote down names."
7654,PART II,
7655,PART II,"“Come to my table,” said Burgard. “Well, Purvis, have you ear-marked"
7656,PART II,our little lot?”
7657,PART II,
7658,PART II,“I’ve been tellin’ ’em for the last hour we’ve only twenty-three
7659,PART II,"vacancies,” was the sergeant’s answer. “I’ve taken nearly fifty for"
7660,PART II,"Trials, and this is what’s left.” Burgard smiled."
7661,PART II,
7662,PART II,"“I’m very sorry,” he said to the crowd, “but C Company’s full.”"
7663,PART II,
7664,PART II,"“Excuse me, Sir,” said a man, “but wouldn’t sea-time count in my"
7665,PART II,"favour? I’ve put in three months with the Fleet. Small quick-firers,"
7666,PART II,Sir? Company guns? Any sort of light machinery?”
7667,PART II,
7668,PART II,"“Come away,” said a voice behind. “They’ve chucked the best farrier"
7669,PART II,between Hull and Dewsbury. Think they’ll take _you_ an’ your potty
7670,PART II,quick-firers?”
7671,PART II,
7672,PART II,The speaker turned on his heel and swore.
7673,PART II,
7674,PART II,"“Oh, damn the Guard, by all means!” said Sergeant Purvis, collecting"
7675,PART II,his papers. “D’you suppose it’s any pleasure to _me_ to reject chaps of
7676,PART II,your build and make? Vote us a second Guard battalion and we’ll
7677,PART II,"accommodate you. Now, you can come into Schools and watch Trials if you"
7678,PART II,like.”
7679,PART II,
7680,PART II,"Most of the men accepted his invitation, but a few walked away angrily."
7681,PART II,I followed from the smoking-room across a wide corridor into a
7682,PART II,"riding-school, under whose roof the voices of the few hundred assembled"
7683,PART II,wandered in lost echoes.
7684,PART II,
7685,PART II,"“I’ll leave you, if you don’t mind,” said Burgard. “Company officers"
7686,PART II,"aren’t supposed to assist at these games. Here, Matthews!” He called to"
7687,PART II,a private and put me in his charge.
7688,PART II,
7689,PART II,In the centre of the vast floor my astonished eyes beheld a group of
7690,PART II,stripped men; the pink of their bodies startling the tan.
7691,PART II,
7692,PART II,"“These are our crowd,” said Matthews. “They’ve been vetted, an’ we’re"
7693,PART II,putting ’em through their paces.”
7694,PART II,
7695,PART II,"“They don’t look a bit like raw material,” I said."
7696,PART II,
7697,PART II,"“No, we don’t use either raw men or raw meat for that matter in the"
7698,PART II,"Guard,” Matthews replied. “Life’s too short.”"
7699,PART II,
7700,PART II,Purvis stepped forward and barked in the professional manner. It was
7701,PART II,"physical drill of the most searching, checked only when he laid his"
7702,PART II,hand over some man’s heart.
7703,PART II,
7704,PART II,"Six or seven, I noticed, were sent back at this stage of the game. Then"
7705,PART II,a cry went up from a group of privates standing near the line of
7706,PART II,"contorted figures. “White, Purvis, white! Number Nine is spitting"
7707,PART II,white!”
7708,PART II,
7709,PART II,"“I know it,” said Purvis. “Don’t you worry.”"
7710,PART II,
7711,PART II,“Unfair!” murmured the man who understood quick-firers. “If I couldn’t
7712,PART II,shape better than that I’d hire myself out to wheel a perambulator.
7713,PART II,He’s cooked.”
7714,PART II,
7715,PART II,"“Nah,” said the intent Matthews. “He’ll answer to a month’s training"
7716,PART II,"like a horse. It’s only suet. _You’ve_ been training for this, haven’t"
7717,PART II,you?”
7718,PART II,
7719,PART II,"“Look at me,” said the man simply."
7720,PART II,
7721,PART II,"“Yes. You’re overtrained,” was Matthews’ comment. “The Guard isn’t a"
7722,PART II,circus.”
7723,PART II,
7724,PART II,"“Guns!” roared Purvis, as the men broke off and panted. “Number off"
7725,PART II,"from the right. Fourteen is one, three is two, eleven’s three, twenty"
7726,PART II,"and thirty-nine are four and five, and five is six.” He was giving them"
7727,PART II,their numbers at the guns as they struggled into their uniforms. In
7728,PART II,"like manner he told off three other guncrews, and the remainder left at"
7729,PART II,"the double, to return through the further doors with four light"
7730,PART II,quick-firers jerking at the end of man-ropes.
7731,PART II,
7732,PART II,“Knock down and assemble against time!” Purvis called.
7733,PART II,
7734,PART II,The audience closed in a little as the crews flung themselves on the
7735,PART II,"guns, which melted, wheel by wheel, beneath their touch."
7736,PART II,
7737,PART II,"“I’ve never seen anything like this,” I whispered."
7738,PART II,
7739,PART II,“Huh!” said Matthews scornfully. “They’re always doin’ it in the Line
7740,PART II,and Militia drill-halls. It’s only circus-work.”
7741,PART II,
7742,PART II,The guns were assembled again and some one called the time. Then
7743,PART II,followed ten minutes of the quickest firing and feeding with dummy
7744,PART II,cartridges that was ever given man to behold.
7745,PART II,
7746,PART II,"“They look as if they might amount to something—this draft,” said"
7747,PART II,Matthews softly.
7748,PART II,
7749,PART II,"“What might you teach ’em after this, then?” I asked."
7750,PART II,
7751,PART II,"“To be Guard,” said Matthews."
7752,PART II,
7753,PART II,"“Spurs,” cried Purvis, as the guns disappeared through the doors into"
7754,PART II,"the stables. Each man plucked at his sleeve, and drew up first one heel"
7755,PART II,and then the other.
7756,PART II,
7757,PART II,“What the deuce are they doing?” I asked.
7758,PART II,
7759,PART II,"“This,” said Matthews. He put his hand to a ticket-pocket inside his"
7760,PART II,"regulation cuff, showed me two very small black box-spurs: drawing up a"
7761,PART II,"gaitered foot, he snapped them into the box in the heel, and when I had"
7762,PART II,inspected snapped them out again.
7763,PART II,
7764,PART II,"“That’s all the spur you really need,” he said."
7765,PART II,
7766,PART II,"Then horses were trotted out into the school barebacked, and the"
7767,PART II,neophytes were told to ride.
7768,PART II,
7769,PART II,"Evidently the beasts knew the game and enjoyed it, for they would not"
7770,PART II,make it easy for the men.
7771,PART II,
7772,PART II,"A heap of saddlery was thrown in a corner, and from this each man, as"
7773,PART II,"he captured his mount, made shift to draw proper equipment, while the"
7774,PART II,"audience laughed, derided, or called the horses towards them."
7775,PART II,
7776,PART II,"It was, most literally, wild horseplay, and by the time it was finished"
7777,PART II,the recruits and the company were weak with fatigue and laughter.
7778,PART II,
7779,PART II,"“That’ll do,” said Purvis, while the men rocked in their saddles. “I"
7780,PART II,don’t see any particular odds between any of you. C Company! Does
7781,PART II,anybody here know anything against any of these men?”
7782,PART II,
7783,PART II,"“That’s a bit of the Regulations,” Matthews whispered. “Just like"
7784,PART II,"forbiddin’ the banns in church. Really, it was all settled long ago"
7785,PART II,when the names first came up.”
7786,PART II,
7787,PART II,There was no answer.
7788,PART II,
7789,PART II,“You’ll take ’em as they stand?”
7790,PART II,
7791,PART II,There was a grunt of assent.
7792,PART II,
7793,PART II,“Very good. There’s forty men for twenty-three billets.” He turned to
7794,PART II,the sweating horsemen. “I must put you into the Hat.”
7795,PART II,
7796,PART II,With great ceremony and a shower of company jokes that I did not
7797,PART II,"follow, an enormous Ally Sloper top-hat was produced, into which"
7798,PART II,"numbers and blanks were dropped, and the whole was handed round to the"
7799,PART II,"riders by a private, evidently the joker of C Company."
7800,PART II,
7801,PART II,Matthews gave me to understand that each company owned a cherished
7802,PART II,receptacle (sometimes not a respectable one) for the papers of the
7803,PART II,final drawing. He was telling me how his company had once stolen the
7804,PART II,Sacred Article used by D Company for this purpose and of the riot that
7805,PART II,"followed, when through the west door of the schools entered a fresh"
7806,PART II,"detachment of stripped men, and the arena was flooded with another"
7807,PART II,company.
7808,PART II,
7809,PART II,"Said Matthews as we withdrew, “Each company does Trials their own way."
7810,PART II,B Company is all for teaching men how to cook and camp. D Company keeps
7811,PART II,’em to horse-work mostly. We call D the circus-riders and B the cooks.
7812,PART II,They call us the Gunners.”
7813,PART II,
7814,PART II,"“An’ you’ve rejected _me_,” said the man who had done sea-time, pushing"
7815,PART II,out before us. “The Army’s goin’ to the dogs.”
7816,PART II,
7817,PART II,I stood in the corridor looking for Burgard.
7818,PART II,
7819,PART II,"“Come up to my room and have a smoke,” said Matthews, private of the"
7820,PART II,Imperial Guard.
7821,PART II,
7822,PART II,We climbed two flights of stone stairs ere we reached an immense
7823,PART II,landing flanked with numbered doors.
7824,PART II,
7825,PART II,Matthews pressed a spring-latch and led me into a little cabin-like
7826,PART II,"room. The cot was a standing bunk, with drawers beneath. On the bed lay"
7827,PART II,a brilliant blanket; by the bed head was an electric light and a shelf
7828,PART II,"of books: a writing table stood in the window, and I dropped into a low"
7829,PART II,wicker chair.
7830,PART II,
7831,PART II,"“This is a cut above subaltern’s quarters,” I said, surveying the"
7832,PART II,"photos, the dhurri on the floor, the rifle in its rack, the field-kit"
7833,PART II,"hung up behind the door, and the knicknacks on the walls."
7834,PART II,
7835,PART II,“The Line bachelors use ’em while we’re away; but they’re nice to come
7836,PART II,back to after ‘heef.’” Matthews passed me his cigarette-case.
7837,PART II,
7838,PART II,“Where have you ‘heefed’?” I said.
7839,PART II,
7840,PART II,"“In Scotland, Central Australia, and North-Eastern Rhodesia and the"
7841,PART II,North-West Indian front.”
7842,PART II,
7843,PART II,“What’s your service?”
7844,PART II,
7845,PART II,“Four years. I’ll have to go in a year. I got in when I was
7846,PART II,twenty-two—by a fluke—from the Militia direct—on Trials.”
7847,PART II,
7848,PART II,“Trials like those we just saw?”
7849,PART II,
7850,PART II,“Not so severe. There was less competition then. I hoped to get my
7851,PART II,"stripes, but there’s no chance.”"
7852,PART II,
7853,PART II,“Why?”
7854,PART II,
7855,PART II,“I haven’t the knack of handling men. Purvis let me have a half-company
7856,PART II,for a month in Rhodesia—over towards Lake N’Garni. I couldn’t work ’em
7857,PART II,properly. It’s a gift.”
7858,PART II,
7859,PART II,“Do colour-sergeants handle half-companies with you?”
7860,PART II,
7861,PART II,“They can command ’em on the ‘heef.’ We’ve only four company
7862,PART II,"officers—Burgard, Luttrell, Kyd, and Harrison. Pigeon’s our swop, and"
7863,PART II,he’s in charge of the ponies. Burgard got his company on the ‘heef.’
7864,PART II,"You see Burgard had been a lieutenant in the Line, but he came into the"
7865,PART II,Guards on Trials like the men. _He_ could command. They tried him in
7866,PART II,India with a wing of the battalion for three months. He did well so he
7867,PART II,"got his company. That’s what made me hopeful. But it’s a gift, you"
7868,PART II,see—managing men—and so I’m only a senior private. They let ten per
7869,PART II,cent of us stay on for two years extra after our three are finished—to
7870,PART II,polish the others.”
7871,PART II,
7872,PART II,“Aren’t you even a corporal?”
7873,PART II,
7874,PART II,"“We haven’t corporals, or lances for that matter, in the Guard. As a"
7875,PART II,senior private I’d take twenty men into action; but one Guard don’t
7876,PART II,tell another how to clean himself. You’ve learned that before you
7877,PART II,apply. … Come in!”
7878,PART II,
7879,PART II,"There was a knock at the door, and Burgard entered, removing his cap."
7880,PART II,
7881,PART II,"“I thought you’d be here,” he said, as Matthews vacated the other chair"
7882,PART II,"and sat on the bed. “Well, has Matthews told you all about it? How did"
7883,PART II,"our Trials go, Matthews?”"
7884,PART II,
7885,PART II,"“Forty names in the Hat, Sir, at the finish. They’ll make a fairish"
7886,PART II,lot. Their gun-tricks weren’t bad; but D company has taken the best
7887,PART II,horsemen—as usual.”
7888,PART II,
7889,PART II,"“Oh, I’ll attend to that on ‘heef.’ Give me a man who can handle"
7890,PART II,company-guns and I’ll engage to make him a horse-master. D company will
7891,PART II,end by thinkin’ ’emselves Captain Pigeon’s private cavalry some day.”
7892,PART II,
7893,PART II,"I had never heard a private and a captain talking after this fashion,"
7894,PART II,"and my face must have betrayed my astonishment, for Burgard said:"
7895,PART II,
7896,PART II,"“These are not our parade manners. In our rooms, as we say in the"
7897,PART II,"Guard, all men are men. Outside we are officers and men.”"
7898,PART II,
7899,PART II,"“I begin to see,” I stammered. “Matthews was telling me that sergeants"
7900,PART II,handled half-companies and rose from the ranks—and I don’t see that
7901,PART II,there are any lieutenants—and your companies appear to be two hundred
7902,PART II,and fifty strong. It’s a shade confusing to the layman.”
7903,PART II,
7904,PART II,Burgard leaned forward didactically. “The Regulations lay down that
7905,PART II,every man’s capacity for command must be tested to the uttermost. We
7906,PART II,"construe that very literally when we’re on the ‘heef.’ F’r instance,"
7907,PART II,"any man can apply to take the command next above him, and if a man’s"
7908,PART II,"too shy to ask, his company officer must see that he gets his chance. A"
7909,PART II,sergeant is given a wing of the battalion to play with for three
7910,PART II,"weeks—a month, or six weeks—according to his capacity, and turned"
7911,PART II,adrift in an Area to make his own arrangements. That’s what Areas are
7912,PART II,for—and to experiment in. A good gunner—a private very often—has all
7913,PART II,"four company-guns to handle through a week’s fight, acting for the time"
7914,PART II,as the major. Majors of Guard battalions (Verschoyle’s our major) are
7915,PART II,"supposed to be responsible for the guns, by the way. There’s nothing to"
7916,PART II,prevent any man who has the gift working his way up to the experimental
7917,PART II,"command of the battalion on ‘heef.’ Purvis, my colour-sergeant,"
7918,PART II,"commanded the battalion for three months at the back of Coolgardie, an’"
7919,PART II,very well he did it. Bayley ’verted to company officer for the time
7920,PART II,"being an’ took Harrison’s company, and Harrison came over to me as my"
7921,PART II,"colour-sergeant. D’you see? Well, Purvis is down for a commission when"
7922,PART II,"there’s a vacancy. He’s been thoroughly tested, and we all like him."
7923,PART II,Two other sergeants have passed that three months’ trial in the same
7924,PART II,way (just as second mates go up for extra master’s certificate). They
7925,PART II,have E.C. after their names in the Army List. That shows they’re
7926,PART II,capable of taking command in event of war. The result of our system is
7927,PART II,that you could knock out every single officer of a Guard battalion
7928,PART II,"early in the day, and the wheels ’ud still go forward, _not_ merely"
7929,PART II,round. We’re allowed to fill up half our commissioned list from the
7930,PART II,ranks direct. _Now_ d’you see why there’s such a rush to get into a
7931,PART II,Guard battalion?”
7932,PART II,
7933,PART II,“Indeed I do. Have you commanded the regiment experimentally?”
7934,PART II,
7935,PART II,"“Oh, time and again,” Burgard laughed. “We’ve all had our E.C. turn.”"
7936,PART II,
7937,PART II,“Doesn’t the chopping and changing upset the men?”
7938,PART II,
7939,PART II,"“It takes something to upset the Guard. Besides, they’re all in the"
7940,PART II,game together. They give each other a fair show you may be sure.”
7941,PART II,
7942,PART II,"“That’s true,” said Matthews. “When I went to N’Gami with my—with the"
7943,PART II,"half-company,” he sighed, “they helped me all they knew. But it’s a"
7944,PART II,gift—handling men. I found _that_ out.”
7945,PART II,
7946,PART II,"“I know you did,” said Burgard softly. “But you found it out in time,"
7947,PART II,"which is the great thing. You see,” he turned to me, “with our limited"
7948,PART II,strength we can’t afford to have a single man who isn’t more than up to
7949,PART II,any duty—in reason. Don’t you be led away by what you saw at Trials
7950,PART II,just now. The Volunteers and the Militia have all the monkey-tricks of
7951,PART II,"the trade—such as mounting and dismounting guns, and making fancy"
7952,PART II,scores and doing record marches; but they need a lot of working up
7953,PART II,before they can pull their weight in the boat.”
7954,PART II,
7955,PART II,There was a knock at the door. A note was handed in. Burgard read it
7956,PART II,and smiled.
7957,PART II,
7958,PART II,“Bayley wants to know if you’d care to come with us to the Park and see
7959,PART II,the kids. It’s only a Saturday afternoon walk-round before the
7960,PART II,taxpayer…. Very good. If you’ll press the button we’ll try to do the
7961,PART II,rest.”
7962,PART II,
7963,PART II,He led me by two flights of stairs up an iron stairway that gave on a
7964,PART II,"platform, not unlike a ship’s bridge, immediately above the barrelled"
7965,PART II,glass roof of the riding-school. Through a ribbed ventilator I could
7966,PART II,see B Company far below watching some men who chased sheep. Burgard
7967,PART II,unlocked a glass-fronted fire-alarm arrangement flanked with dials and
7968,PART II,"speaking-tubes, and bade me press the centre button."
7969,PART II,
7970,PART II,Next moment I should have fallen through the riding-school roof if he
7971,PART II,had not caught me; for the huge building below my feet thrilled to the
7972,PART II,multiplied purring of electric bells. The men in the school vanished
7973,PART II,"like minnows before a shadow, and above the stamp of booted feet on"
7974,PART II,staircases I heard the neighing of many horses.
7975,PART II,
7976,PART II,“What in the world have I done?” I gasped.
7977,PART II,
7978,PART II,"“Turned out the Guard—horse, foot, and guns!”"
7979,PART II,
7980,PART II,A telephone bell rang imperiously. Burgard snatched up the receiver:
7981,PART II,
7982,PART II,"“Yes, Sir…. _What_, Sir?… I never heard they said that,” he laughed,"
7983,PART II,"“but it would be just like ’em. In an hour and a half? Yes, Sir."
7984,PART II,"Opposite the Statue? Yes, Sir.”"
7985,PART II,
7986,PART II,He turned to me with a wink as he hung up.
7987,PART II,
7988,PART II,“Bayley’s playing up for you. Now you’ll see some fun.”
7989,PART II,
7990,PART II,“Who’s going to catch it?” I demanded.
7991,PART II,
7992,PART II,“Only our local Foreign Service Corps. Its C.O. has been boasting that
7993,PART II,"it’s _en état de partir_, and Bayley’s going to take him at his word"
7994,PART II,and have a kit-inspection this afternoon in the Park. I must tell their
7995,PART II,drill-hall. Look over yonder between that brewery chimney and the
7996,PART II,mansard roof!”
7997,PART II,
7998,PART II,"He readdressed himself to the telephone, and I kept my eye on the"
7999,PART II,building to the southward. A Blue Peter climbed up to the top of the
8000,PART II,flagstaff that crowned it and blew out in the summer breeze. A black
8001,PART II,storm-cone followed.
8002,PART II,
8003,PART II,"“Inspection for F.S. corps acknowledged, Sir,” said Burgard down the"
8004,PART II,telephone. “Now we’d better go to the riding-school. The battalion
8005,PART II,"falls in there. I have to change, but you’re free of the corps. Go"
8006,PART II,anywhere. Ask anything. In another ten minutes we’re off.”
8007,PART II,
8008,PART II,"I lingered for a little looking over the great city, its huddle of"
8009,PART II,"houses and the great fringe of the Park, all framed between the open"
8010,PART II,windows of this dial-dotted eyrie.
8011,PART II,
8012,PART II,When I descended the halls and corridors were as hushed as they had
8013,PART II,"been noisy, and my feet echoed down the broad tiled staircases. On the"
8014,PART II,"third floor, Matthews, gaitered and armed, overtook me smiling."
8015,PART II,
8016,PART II,"“I thought you might want a guide,” said he. “We’ve five minutes yet,”"
8017,PART II,and piloted me to the sunsplashed gloom of the riding-school. Three
8018,PART II,"companies were in close order on the tan. They moved out at a whistle,"
8019,PART II,and as I followed in their rear I was overtaken by Pigeon on a rough
8020,PART II,black mare.
8021,PART II,
8022,PART II,"“Wait a bit,” he said, “till the horses are all out of stables, and"
8023,PART II,come with us. D Company is the only one mounted just now. We do it to
8024,PART II,"amuse the taxpayer,” he explained, above the noise of horses on the"
8025,PART II,tan.
8026,PART II,
8027,PART II,"“Where are the guns?” I asked, as the mare lipped my coat-collar."
8028,PART II,
8029,PART II,“Gone ahead long ago. They come out of their own door at the back of
8030,PART II,barracks. We don’t haul guns through traffic more than we can help…. If
8031,PART II,Belinda breathes down your neck smack her. She’ll be quiet in the
8032,PART II,streets. She loves lookin’ into the shop-windows.”
8033,PART II,
8034,PART II,The mounted company clattered through vaulted concrete corridors in the
8035,PART II,"wake of the main body, and filed out into the crowded streets."
8036,PART II,
8037,PART II,"When I looked at the townsfolk on the pavement, or in the double-decked"
8038,PART II,"trams, I saw that the bulk of them saluted, not grudgingly or of"
8039,PART II,"necessity, but in a light-hearted, even flippant fashion."
8040,PART II,
8041,PART II,"“Those are Line and Militia men,” said Pigeon. “That old chap in the"
8042,PART II,top-hat by the lamp-post is an ex-Guardee. That’s why he’s saluting in
8043,PART II,"slow-time. No, there’s no regulation governing these things, but we’ve"
8044,PART II,"all fallen into the way of it somehow. Steady, mare!”"
8045,PART II,
8046,PART II,"“I don’t know whether I care about this aggressive militarism,” I"
8047,PART II,"began, when the company halted, and Belinda almost knocked me down."
8048,PART II,Looking forward I saw the badged cuff of a policeman upraised at a
8049,PART II,"crossing, his back towards us."
8050,PART II,
8051,PART II,"“Horrid aggressive, ain’t we?” said Pigeon with a chuckle when we moved"
8052,PART II,on again and overtook the main body. Here I caught the strains of the
8053,PART II,"band, which Pigeon told me did not accompany the battalion on ‘heef,’"
8054,PART II,but lived in barracks and made much money by playing at parties in
8055,PART II,town.
8056,PART II,
8057,PART II,"“If we want anything more than drums and fifes on ‘heef’ we sing,” said"
8058,PART II,Pigeon. “Singin’ helps the wind.”
8059,PART II,
8060,PART II,I rejoiced to the marrow of my bones thus to be borne along on billows
8061,PART II,"of surging music among magnificent men, in sunlight, through a crowded"
8062,PART II,"town whose people, I could feel, regarded us with comradeship,"
8063,PART II,affection—and more.
8064,PART II,
8065,PART II,"“By Jove,” I said at last, watching the eyes about us, “these people"
8066,PART II,are looking us over as if we were horses.”
8067,PART II,
8068,PART II,“Why not? They know the game.”
8069,PART II,
8070,PART II,"The eyes on the pavement, in the trams, the cabs, at the upper windows,"
8071,PART II,swept our lines back and forth with a weighed intensity of regard which
8072,PART II,"at first seemed altogether new to me, till I recalled just such eyes, a"
8073,PART II,"thousand of them, at manœuvres in the Channel when one crowded"
8074,PART II,battleship drew past its sister at biscuit-toss range. Then I stared at
8075,PART II,"the ground, overborne by those considering eyes."
8076,PART II,
8077,PART II,"Suddenly the music changed to the wail of the Dead March in “Saul,” and"
8078,PART II,once more—we were crossing a large square—the regiment halted.
8079,PART II,
8080,PART II,"“Damn!” said Pigeon, glancing behind him at the mounted company. “I"
8081,PART II,believe they save up their Saturday corpses on purpose.”
8082,PART II,
8083,PART II,“What is it?” I asked.
8084,PART II,
8085,PART II,“A dead Volunteer. We must play him through.” Again I looked forward
8086,PART II,"and saw the top of a hearse, followed by two mourning-coaches, boring"
8087,PART II,"directly up the halted regiment, which opened out company by company to"
8088,PART II,let it through.
8089,PART II,
8090,PART II,“But they’ve got the whole blessed square to funeralise in!” I
8091,PART II,exclaimed. “Why don’t they go round?”
8092,PART II,
8093,PART II,“Not so!” Pigeon replied. “In this city it’s the Volunteer’s perquisite
8094,PART II,to be played through by any corps he happens to meet on his way to the
8095,PART II,cemetery. And they make the most of it. You’ll see.”
8096,PART II,
8097,PART II,"I heard the order, “Rest on your arms,” run before the poor little"
8098,PART II,procession as the men opened out. The driver pulled the black Flanders
8099,PART II,"beasts into a more than funeral crawl, and in the first mourning-coach"
8100,PART II,"I saw the tearful face of a fat woman (his mother, doubtless), a"
8101,PART II,"handkerchief pressed to one eye, but the other rolling vigilantly,"
8102,PART II,"alight with proper pride. Last came a knot of uniformed men—privates, I"
8103,PART II,took it—of the dead one’s corps.
8104,PART II,
8105,PART II,"Said a man in the crowd beside us to the girl on his arm, “There,"
8106,PART II,Jenny! That’s what I’ll get if I ’ave the luck to meet ’em when my time
8107,PART II,comes.”
8108,PART II,
8109,PART II,"“You an’ your luck,” she snapped. “’Ow can you talk such silly"
8110,PART II,nonsense?”
8111,PART II,
8112,PART II,"“Played through by the Guard,” he repeated slowly. “The undertaker ’oo"
8113,PART II,"could guarantee _that_, mark you, for all his customers—well, ’e’d"
8114,PART II,"monopolise the trade, is all I can say. See the horses passagin’"
8115,PART II,sideways!”
8116,PART II,
8117,PART II,"“She done it a purpose,” said the woman with a sniff."
8118,PART II,
8119,PART II,“An’ I only hope you’ll follow her example. Just as long as you think
8120,PART II,"I’ll keep, too.”"
8121,PART II,
8122,PART II,We reclosed when the funeral had left us twenty paces behind. A small
8123,PART II,boy stuck his head out of a carriage and watched us jealously.
8124,PART II,
8125,PART II,“Amazing! Amazing!” I murmured. “Is it regulation?”
8126,PART II,
8127,PART II,"“No. Town-custom. It varies a little in different cities, but the"
8128,PART II,"people value being played through more than most things, I imagine."
8129,PART II,"Duddell, the big Ipswich manufacturer—he’s a Quaker—tried to bring in a"
8130,PART II,bill to suppress it as unchristian.” Pigeon laughed.
8131,PART II,
8132,PART II,“And?”
8133,PART II,
8134,PART II,"“It cost him his seat next election. You see, we’re all in the game.”"
8135,PART II,
8136,PART II,"We reached the Park without further adventure, and found the four"
8137,PART II,company-guns with their spike teams and single drivers waiting for us.
8138,PART II,"Many people were gathered here, and we were halted, so far as I could"
8139,PART II,"see, that they might talk with the men in the ranks. The officers broke"
8140,PART II,into groups.
8141,PART II,
8142,PART II,“Why on earth didn’t you come along with me?” said Boy Bayley at my
8143,PART II,side. “I was expecting you.”
8144,PART II,
8145,PART II,"“Well, I had a delicacy about brigading myself with a colonel at the"
8146,PART II,"head of his regiment, so I stayed with the rear company and the horses."
8147,PART II,It’s all too wonderful for any words. What’s going to happen next?”
8148,PART II,
8149,PART II,"“I’ve handed over to Verschoyle, who will amuse and edify the school"
8150,PART II,"children while I take you round our kindergarten. Don’t kill any one,"
8151,PART II,Vee. Are you goin’ to charge ’em?”
8152,PART II,
8153,PART II,Old Verschoyle hitched his big shoulder and nodded precisely as he used
8154,PART II,to do at school. He was a boy of few words grown into a kindly taciturn
8155,PART II,man.
8156,PART II,
8157,PART II,“Now!” Bayley slid his arm through mine and led me across a riding road
8158,PART II,towards a stretch of rough common (singularly out of place in a park)
8159,PART II,perhaps three-quarters of a mile long and half as wide. On the
8160,PART II,encircling rails leaned an almost unbroken line of men and women—the
8161,PART II,women outnumbering the men. I saw the Guard battalion move up the road
8162,PART II,flanking the common and disappear behind the trees.
8163,PART II,
8164,PART II,As far as the eye could range through the mellow English haze the
8165,PART II,"ground inside the railings was dotted with boys in and out of uniform,"
8166,PART II,"armed and unarmed. I saw squads here, half-companies there; then three"
8167,PART II,"companies in an open space, wheeling with stately steps; a knot of"
8168,PART II,drums and fifes near the railings unconcernedly slashing their way
8169,PART II,across popular airs; and a batch of gamins labouring through some
8170,PART II,extended attack destined to be swept aside by a corps crossing the
8171,PART II,"ground at the double. They broke out of furze bushes, ducked over"
8172,PART II,"hollows and bunkers, held or fell away from hillocks and rough"
8173,PART II,sandbanks till the eye wearied of their busy legs.
8174,PART II,
8175,PART II,"Bayley took me through the railings, and gravely returned the salute of"
8176,PART II,a freckled twelve-year-old near by.
8177,PART II,
8178,PART II,“What’s your corps?” said the Colonel of that Imperial Guard battalion
8179,PART II,to that child.
8180,PART II,
8181,PART II,"“Eighth District Board School, fourth standard, Sir. We aren’t out"
8182,PART II,"to-day.” Then, with a twinkle, “I go to First Camp next year.”"
8183,PART II,
8184,PART II,“What are those boys yonder—that squad at the double?”
8185,PART II,
8186,PART II,"“Jewboys, Sir. Jewish Voluntary Schools, Sir.”"
8187,PART II,
8188,PART II,“And that full company extending behind the three elms to the
8189,PART II,south-west?”
8190,PART II,
8191,PART II,"“Private day-schools, Sir, I think. Judging distance, Sir.”"
8192,PART II,
8193,PART II,“Can you come with us?”
8194,PART II,
8195,PART II,"“Certainly, Sir.”"
8196,PART II,
8197,PART II,"“Here’s the raw material at the beginning of the process,” said Bayley"
8198,PART II,to me.
8199,PART II,
8200,PART II,"We strolled on towards the strains of “A Bicycle Built for Two,”"
8201,PART II,breathed jerkily into a mouth-organ by a slim maid of fourteen. Some
8202,PART II,dozen infants with clenched fists and earnest legs were swinging
8203,PART II,through the extension movements which that tune calls for. A stunted
8204,PART II,"hawthorn overhung the little group, and from a branch a dirty white"
8205,PART II,"handkerchief flapped in the breeze. The girl blushed, scowled, and"
8206,PART II,wiped the mouth-organ on her sleeve as we came up.
8207,PART II,
8208,PART II,"“We’re all waiting for our big bruvvers,” piped up one bold person in"
8209,PART II,blue breeches—seven if he was a day.
8210,PART II,
8211,PART II,"“It keeps ’em quieter, Sir,” the maiden lisped. “The others are with"
8212,PART II,the regiments.”
8213,PART II,
8214,PART II,"“Yeth, and they’ve all lots of blank for _you_,” said the gentleman in"
8215,PART II,blue breeches ferociously.
8216,PART II,
8217,PART II,"“Oh, Artie! ’Ush!” the girl cried."
8218,PART II,
8219,PART II,“But why have they lots of blank for _us_?” Bayley asked. Blue Breeches
8220,PART II,stood firm.
8221,PART II,
8222,PART II,“’Cause—’cause the Guard’s goin’ to fight the Schools this afternoon;
8223,PART II,but my big bruvver says they’ll be dam-well surprised.”
8224,PART II,
8225,PART II,“_Artie!_” The girl leaped towards him. “You know your ma said I was to
8226,PART II,smack——”
8227,PART II,
8228,PART II,"“Don’t. Please don’t,” said Bayley, pink with suppressed mirth. “It was"
8229,PART II,all my fault. I must tell old Verschoyle this. I’ve surprised his plan
8230,PART II,out of the mouths of babes and sucklings.”
8231,PART II,
8232,PART II,“What plan?”
8233,PART II,
8234,PART II,"“Old Vee has taken the battalion up to the top of the common, and he"
8235,PART II,"told me he meant to charge down through the kids, but they’re on to him"
8236,PART II,already. He’ll be scuppered. The Guard will be scuppered!”
8237,PART II,
8238,PART II,"Here Blue Breeches, overcome by the reproof of his fellows, began to"
8239,PART II,weep.
8240,PART II,
8241,PART II,"“I didn’t tell,” he roared. “My big bruvver _he_ knew when he saw them"
8242,PART II,go up the road…”
8243,PART II,
8244,PART II,"“Never mind! Never mind, old man,” said Bayley soothingly. “I’m not"
8245,PART II,fighting to-day. It’s all right.”
8246,PART II,
8247,PART II,"He rightened it yet further with sixpence, and left that band loudly at"
8248,PART II,feud over the spoil.
8249,PART II,
8250,PART II,"“Oh, Vee! Vee the strategist,” he chuckled. “We’ll pull Vee’s leg"
8251,PART II,to-night.”
8252,PART II,
8253,PART II,Our freckled friend of the barriers doubled up behind us.
8254,PART II,
8255,PART II,"“So you know that my battalion is charging down the ground,” Bayley"
8256,PART II,demanded.
8257,PART II,
8258,PART II,"“Not for certain, Sir, but we’re preparin’ for the worst,” he answered"
8259,PART II,with a cheerful grin. “They allow the Schools a little blank ammunition
8260,PART II,after we’ve passed the third standard; and we nearly always bring it on
8261,PART II,to the ground of Saturdays.”
8262,PART II,
8263,PART II,“The deuce you do! Why?”
8264,PART II,
8265,PART II,"“On account of these amateur Volunteer corps, Sir. They’re always"
8266,PART II,"experimentin’ upon us, Sir, comin’ over from their ground an’"
8267,PART II,"developin’ attacks on our flanks. Oh, it’s chronic ’ere of a Saturday"
8268,PART II,"sometimes, unless you flag yourself.”"
8269,PART II,
8270,PART II,I followed his eye and saw white flags fluttering before a drum and
8271,PART II,fife band and a knot of youths in sweaters gathered round the dummy
8272,PART II,breech of a four-inch gun which they were feeding at express rates.
8273,PART II,
8274,PART II,"“The attacks don’t interfere with you if you flag yourself, Sir,” the"
8275,PART II,boy explained. “That’s a Second Camp team from the Technical Schools
8276,PART II,loading against time for a bet.”
8277,PART II,
8278,PART II,We picked our way deviously through the busy groups. Apparently it was
8279,PART II,"not etiquette to notice a Guard officer, and the youths at the"
8280,PART II,twenty-five pounder were far too busy to look up. I watched the cleanly
8281,PART II,finished hoist and shove-home of the full-weight shell from a safe
8282,PART II,"distance, when I became aware of a change among the scattered boys on"
8283,PART II,"the common, who disappeared among the hillocks to an accompaniment of"
8284,PART II,querulous whistles. A boy or two on bicycles dashed from corps to
8285,PART II,"corps, and on their arrival each corps seemed to fade away."
8286,PART II,
8287,PART II,The youths at loading practice did not pause for the growing hush round
8288,PART II,"them, nor did the drum and fife band drop a single note. Bayley"
8289,PART II,"exploded afresh. “The Schools are preparing for our attack, by Jove! I"
8290,PART II,wonder who’s directin’ ’em. Do _you_ know?”
8291,PART II,
8292,PART II,The warrior of the Eighth District looked up shrewdly.
8293,PART II,
8294,PART II,“I saw Mr. Cameron speaking to Mr. Levitt just as the Guard went up the
8295,PART II,"road. ’E’s our ’ead-master, Mr. Cameron, but Mr. Levitt, of the Sixth"
8296,PART II,"District, is actin’ as senior officer on the ground this Saturday. Most"
8297,PART II,likely Mr. Levitt is commandin’.”
8298,PART II,
8299,PART II,“How many corps are there here?” I asked.
8300,PART II,
8301,PART II,"“Oh, bits of lots of ’em—thirty or forty, p’r’aps, Sir. But the"
8302,PART II,whistles says they’ve all got to rally on the Board Schools. ’Ark!
8303,PART II,There’s the whistle for the Private Schools! They’ve been called up the
8304,PART II,ground at the double.”
8305,PART II,
8306,PART II,"“Stop!” cried a bearded man with a watch, and the crews dropped beside"
8307,PART II,the breech wiping their brows and panting.
8308,PART II,
8309,PART II,"“Hullo! there’s some attack on the Schools,” said one. “Well, Marden,"
8310,PART II,you owe me three half-crowns. I’ve beaten your record. Pay up.”
8311,PART II,
8312,PART II,The boy beside us tapped his foot fretfully as he eyed his companions
8313,PART II,"melting among the hillocks, but the gun-team adjusted their bets"
8314,PART II,without once looking up.
8315,PART II,
8316,PART II,The ground rose a little to a furze-crowned ridge in the centre so that
8317,PART II,"I could not see the full length of it, but I heard a faint bubble of"
8318,PART II,blank in the distance.
8319,PART II,
8320,PART II,"“The Saturday allowance,” murmured Bayley. “War’s begun, but it"
8321,PART II,"wouldn’t be etiquette for us to interfere. What are you saying, my"
8322,PART II,child?”
8323,PART II,
8324,PART II,"“Nothin’, Sir, only—only I don’t think the Guard will be able to come"
8325,PART II,"through on so narrer a front, Sir. They’ll all be jammed up be’ind the"
8326,PART II,ridge if _we_’ve got there in time. It’s awful sticky for guns at the
8327,PART II,"end of our ground, Sir.”"
8328,PART II,
8329,PART II,"“I’m inclined to think you’re right, Moltke. The Guard is hung up:"
8330,PART II,distinctly so. Old Vee will have to cut his way through. What a
8331,PART II,pernicious amount of blank the kids seem to have!”
8332,PART II,
8333,PART II,It was quite a respectable roar of battle that rolled among the
8334,PART II,"hillocks for ten minutes, always out of our sight. Then we heard the"
8335,PART II,“Cease Fire” over the ridge.
8336,PART II,
8337,PART II,"“They’ve sent for the Umpires,” the Board School boy squeaked, dancing"
8338,PART II,"on one foot. “You’ve been hung up, Sir. I—I thought the sand-pits ’ud"
8339,PART II,stop you.”
8340,PART II,
8341,PART II,"Said one of the jerseyed hobbledehoys at the gun, slipping on his coat:"
8342,PART II,"“Well, that’s enough for this afternoon. I’m off,” and moved to the"
8343,PART II,railings without even glancing towards the fray.
8344,PART II,
8345,PART II,"“I anticipate the worst,” said Bayley with gravity after a few minutes."
8346,PART II,“Hullo! Here comes my disgraced corps!”
8347,PART II,
8348,PART II,"The Guard was pouring over the ridge—a disorderly mob—horse, foot, and"
8349,PART II,"guns mixed, while from every hollow of the ground about rose small boys"
8350,PART II,cheering shrilly. The outcry was taken up by the parents at the
8351,PART II,"railings, and spread to a complete circle of cheers, handclappings, and"
8352,PART II,waved handkerchiefs.
8353,PART II,
8354,PART II,Our Eighth District private cast away restraint and openly capered. “We
8355,PART II,got ’em! We got ’em!” he squealed.
8356,PART II,
8357,PART II,The grey-green flood paused a fraction of a minute and drew itself into
8358,PART II,"shape, coming to rest before Bayley. Verschoyle saluted."
8359,PART II,
8360,PART II,"“Vee, Vee,” said Bayley. “Give me back my legions. Well, I hope you’re"
8361,PART II,proud of yourself?”
8362,PART II,
8363,PART II,"“The little beasts were ready for us. Deuced well posted too,”"
8364,PART II,Verschoyle replied. “I wish you’d seen that first attack on our flank.
8365,PART II,Rather impressive. Who warned ’em?”
8366,PART II,
8367,PART II,“I don’t know. I got my information from a baby in blue plush breeches.
8368,PART II,Did they do well?”
8369,PART II,
8370,PART II,“Very decently indeed. I’ve complimented their C.O. and buttered the
8371,PART II,"whole boiling.” He lowered his voice. “As a matter o’ fact, I halted"
8372,PART II,five good minutes to give ’em time to get into position.”
8373,PART II,
8374,PART II,"“Well, now we can inspect our Foreign Service corps. We sha’n’t need"
8375,PART II,"the men for an hour, Vee.”"
8376,PART II,
8377,PART II,"“Very good, Sir. Colour-sergeants!” cried Verschoyle, raising his"
8378,PART II,"voice, and the cry ran from company to company. Whereupon the officers"
8379,PART II,"left their men, people began to climb over the railings, and the"
8380,PART II,regiment dissolved among the spectators and the school corps of the
8381,PART II,city.
8382,PART II,
8383,PART II,"“No sense keeping men standing when you don’t need ’em,” said Bayley."
8384,PART II,"“Besides, the Schools learn more from our chaps in an afternoon than"
8385,PART II,they can pick up in a month’s drill. Look at those Board-schoolmaster
8386,PART II,captains buttonholing old Purvis on the art of war!”
8387,PART II,
8388,PART II,"“Wonder what the evening papers’ll say about this,” said Pigeon."
8389,PART II,
8390,PART II,"“You’ll know in half an hour,” Burgard laughed. “What possessed you to"
8391,PART II,"take your ponies across the sand-pits, Pij?”"
8392,PART II,
8393,PART II,"“Pride. Silly pride,” said the Canadian."
8394,PART II,
8395,PART II,We crossed the common to a very regulation paradeground overlooked by a
8396,PART II,"statue of our Queen. Here were carriages, many and elegant, filled with"
8397,PART II,"pretty women, and the railings were lined with frockcoats and top hats."
8398,PART II,"“This is distinctly social,” I suggested to Kyd."
8399,PART II,
8400,PART II,"“Ra-ather. Our F.S. corps is nothing if not correct, but Bayley’ll"
8401,PART II,sweat ’em all the same.”
8402,PART II,
8403,PART II,I saw six companies drawn up for inspection behind lines of long
8404,PART II,sausage-shaped kit-bags. A band welcomed us with “A Life on the Ocean
8405,PART II,Wave.”
8406,PART II,
8407,PART II,"“What cheek!” muttered Verschoyle. “Give ’em beans, Bayley.”"
8408,PART II,
8409,PART II,"“I intend to,” said the Colonel, grimly. “Will each of you fellows take"
8410,PART II,"a company, please, and inspect ’em faithfully. ‘_En état de partir_’ is"
8411,PART II,"their little boast, remember. When you’ve finished you can give ’em a"
8412,PART II,little pillow-fighting.”
8413,PART II,
8414,PART II,“What does the single cannon on those men’s sleeves mean?” I asked.
8415,PART II,
8416,PART II,"“That they’re big gun-men, who’ve done time with the Fleet,” Bayley"
8417,PART II,returned. “Any F.S. corps that has over twenty per cent big-gun men
8418,PART II,thinks itself entitled to play ‘A Life on the Ocean Wave’—when it’s out
8419,PART II,of hearing of the Navy.”
8420,PART II,
8421,PART II,“What beautiful stuff they are! What’s their regimental average?”
8422,PART II,
8423,PART II,"“It ought to be five eight, height, thirty-eight, chest, and"
8424,PART II,"twenty-four years, age. What is it?” Bayley asked of a Private."
8425,PART II,
8426,PART II,"“Five nine and half, Sir, thirty-nine, twenty-four and a half,” was the"
8427,PART II,"reply, and he added insolently, “_En état de partir_.” Evidently that"
8428,PART II,F.S. corps was on its mettle ready for the worst.
8429,PART II,
8430,PART II,“What about their musketry average?” I went on.
8431,PART II,
8432,PART II,"“Not my pidgin,” said Bayley. “But they wouldn’t be in the corps a day"
8433,PART II,if they couldn’t shoot; I know _that_ much. Now I’m going to go through
8434,PART II,’em for socks and slippers.”
8435,PART II,
8436,PART II,The kit-inspection exceeded anything I had ever dreamed. I drifted from
8437,PART II,company to company while the Guard officers oppressed them. Twenty per
8438,PART II,"cent, at least, of the kits were shovelled out on the grass and gone"
8439,PART II,through in detail.
8440,PART II,
8441,PART II,“What have they got jumpers and ducks for?” I asked of Harrison.
8442,PART II,
8443,PART II,"“For Fleet work, of course. _En état de partir_ with an F. S. corps"
8444,PART II,means they are amphibious.”
8445,PART II,
8446,PART II,“Who gives ’em their kit—Government?”
8447,PART II,
8448,PART II,"“There is a Government allowance, but no C. O. sticks to it. It’s the"
8449,PART II,same as paint and gold-leaf in the Navy. It comes out of some one’s
8450,PART II,pockets. How much does your kit cost you?”—this to the private in front
8451,PART II,of us.
8452,PART II,
8453,PART II,"“About ten or fifteen quid every other year, I suppose,” was the"
8454,PART II,answer.
8455,PART II,
8456,PART II,“Very good. Pack your bag—quick.”
8457,PART II,
8458,PART II,"The man knelt, and with supremely deft hands returned all to the bag,"
8459,PART II,"lashed and tied it, and fell back."
8460,PART II,
8461,PART II,"“Arms,” said Harrison. “Strip and show ammunition.”"
8462,PART II,
8463,PART II,The man divested himself of his rolled greatcoat and haversack with one
8464,PART II,"wriggle, as it seemed to me; a twist of a screw removed the side plate"
8465,PART II,of the rifle breech (it was not a bolt action). He handed it to
8466,PART II,"Harrison with one hand, and with the other loosed his clip-studded"
8467,PART II,belt.
8468,PART II,
8469,PART II,“What baby cartridges!” I exclaimed. “No bigger than bulletted
8470,PART II,breech-caps.”
8471,PART II,
8472,PART II,"“They’re the regulation .256,” said Harrison. “No one has complained of"
8473,PART II,"’em yet. They expand a bit when they arrive…. Empty your bottle,"
8474,PART II,"please, and show your rations.”"
8475,PART II,
8476,PART II,The man poured out his water-bottle and showed the two-inch emergency
8477,PART II,tin.
8478,PART II,
8479,PART II,"Harrison passed on to the next, but I was fascinated by the way in"
8480,PART II,"which the man re-established himself amid his straps and buckles,"
8481,PART II,asking no help from either side.
8482,PART II,
8483,PART II,“How long does it take you to prepare for inspection?” I asked him.
8484,PART II,
8485,PART II,"“Well, I got ready this afternoon in twelve minutes,” he smiled. “I"
8486,PART II,didn’t see the storm-cone till half-past three. I was at the Club.”
8487,PART II,
8488,PART II,“Weren’t a good many of you out of town?”
8489,PART II,
8490,PART II,"“Not _this_ Saturday. We knew what was coming. You see, if we pull"
8491,PART II,through the inspection we may move up one place on the roster for
8492,PART II,foreign service…. You’d better stand back. We’re going to
8493,PART II,pillow-fight.”
8494,PART II,
8495,PART II,"The companies stooped to the stuffed kit-bags, doubled with them"
8496,PART II,"variously, piled them in squares and mounds, passed them from shoulder"
8497,PART II,"to shoulder like buckets at a fire, and repeated the evolution."
8498,PART II,
8499,PART II,"“What’s the idea?” I asked of Verschoyle, who, arms folded behind him,"
8500,PART II,was controlling the display. Many women had descended from the
8501,PART II,"carriages, and were pressing in about us admiringly."
8502,PART II,
8503,PART II,"“For one thing, it’s a fair test of wind and muscle, and for another it"
8504,PART II,saves time at the docks. We’ll suppose this first company to be drawn
8505,PART II,up on the dock-head and those five others still in the troop-train. How
8506,PART II,would you get their kit into the ship?”
8507,PART II,
8508,PART II,"“Fall ’em all in on the platform, march ’em to the gangways,” I"
8509,PART II,"answered, “and trust to Heaven and a fatigue party to gather the"
8510,PART II,baggage and drunks in later.”
8511,PART II,
8512,PART II,"“Ye-es, and have half of it sent by the wrong trooper. I know _that_"
8513,PART II,"game,” Verschoyle drawled. “We don’t play it any more. Look!”"
8514,PART II,
8515,PART II,"He raised his voice, and five companies, glistening a little and"
8516,PART II,"breathing hard, formed at right angles to the sixth, each man embracing"
8517,PART II,his sixty-pound bag.
8518,PART II,
8519,PART II,"“Pack away,” cried Verschoyle, and the great bean-bag game (I can"
8520,PART II,compare it to nothing else) began. In five minutes every bag was passed
8521,PART II,"along either arm of the T and forward down the sixth company, who"
8522,PART II,"passed, stacked, and piled them in a great heap. These were followed by"
8523,PART II,"the rifles, belts, greatcoats, and knapsacks, so that in another five"
8524,PART II,"minutes the regiment stood, as it were, stripped clean."
8525,PART II,
8526,PART II,“Of course on a trooper there’d be a company below stacking the kit
8527,PART II,"away,” said Verschoyle, “but that wasn’t so bad.”"
8528,PART II,
8529,PART II,“Bad!” I cried. “It was miraculous!”
8530,PART II,
8531,PART II,“Circus-work—all circus-work!” said Pigeon. “It won’t prevent ’em bein’
8532,PART II,"sick as dogs when the ship rolls.” The crowd round us applauded, while"
8533,PART II,the men looked meekly down their self-conscious noses.
8534,PART II,
8535,PART II,A little grey-whiskered man trotted up to the Boy.
8536,PART II,
8537,PART II,"“Have we made good, Bayley?” he said. “Are we _en état de partir_?”"
8538,PART II,
8539,PART II,"“That’s what I shall report,” said Bayley, smiling."
8540,PART II,
8541,PART II,"“I thought my bit o’ French ’ud draw you,” said the little man, rubbing"
8542,PART II,his hands.
8543,PART II,
8544,PART II,“Who is he?” I whispered to Pigeon.
8545,PART II,
8546,PART II,“Ramsay—their C.O. An old Guard captain. A keen little devil. They say
8547,PART II,he spends six hundred a year on the show. He used to be in the Lincolns
8548,PART II,till he came into his property.”
8549,PART II,
8550,PART II,"“Take ’em home an’ make ’em drunk,” I heard Bayley say. “I suppose"
8551,PART II,you’ll have a dinner to celebrate. But you may as well tell the
8552,PART II,officers of E company that I don’t think much of them. I sha’n’t report
8553,PART II,"it, but their men were all over the shop.”"
8554,PART II,
8555,PART II,"“Well, they’re young, you see,” Colonel Ramsay began."
8556,PART II,
8557,PART II,“You’re quite right. Send ’em to me and I’ll talk to ’em. Youth is the
8558,PART II,time to learn.”
8559,PART II,
8560,PART II,"“Six hundred a year,” I repeated to Pigeon. “That must be an awful tax"
8561,PART II,on a man. Worse than in the old volunteering days.”
8562,PART II,
8563,PART II,"“That’s where you make your mistake,” said Verschoyle. “In the old days"
8564,PART II,a man had to spend his money to coax his men to drill because they
8565,PART II,weren’t the genuine article. You know what I mean. They made a favour
8566,PART II,"of putting in drills, didn’t they? And they were, most of ’em, the"
8567,PART II,"children we have to take over at Second Camp, weren’t they? Well, now"
8568,PART II,"that a C. O. is sure of his _men_, now that he hasn’t to waste himself"
8569,PART II,"in conciliating an’ bribin’, an’ beerin’ _kids_, he doesn’t care what"
8570,PART II,"he spends on his corps, because every pound tells. Do you understand?”"
8571,PART II,
8572,PART II,"“I see what you mean, Vee. Having the male material guaranteed——”"
8573,PART II,
8574,PART II,"“And trained material at that,” Pigeon put in. “Eight years in the"
8575,PART II,"schools, remember, as well as——”"
8576,PART II,
8577,PART II,"“Precisely. A man rejoices in working them up. That’s as it should be,”"
8578,PART II,I said.
8579,PART II,
8580,PART II,"“Bayly’s saying the very same to those F. S. pups,” said Verschoyle."
8581,PART II,
8582,PART II,"The Boy was behind us, between two young F. S. officers, a hand on the"
8583,PART II,shoulder of each.
8584,PART II,
8585,PART II,"“Yes, that’s all doocid interesting,” he growled paternally. “But you"
8586,PART II,"forget, my sons, now that your men are bound to serve, you’re trebly"
8587,PART II,bound to put a polish on ’em. You’ve let your company simply go to
8588,PART II,seed. Don’t try and explain. I’ve told all those lies myself in my
8589,PART II,time. It’s only idleness. _I_ know. Come and lunch with me to-morrow
8590,PART II,and I’ll give you a wrinkle or two in barracks.” He turned to me.
8591,PART II,
8592,PART II,“Suppose we pick up Vee’s defeated legion and go home. You’ll dine with
8593,PART II,"us to-night. Good-bye, Ramsay. Yes, you’re _en état de partir_, right"
8594,PART II,enough. You’d better get Lady Gertrude to talk to the Armity if you
8595,PART II,want the corps sent foreign. I’m no politician.”
8596,PART II,
8597,PART II,"We strolled away from the great white statue of the Widow, with"
8598,PART II,"sceptre, orb, and crown, that looked toward the city, and regained the"
8599,PART II,"common, where the Guard battalion walked with the female of its species"
8600,PART II,and the children of all its relatives. At sight of the officers the
8601,PART II,uniforms began to detach themselves and gather in companies. A Board
8602,PART II,"School corps was moving off the ground, headed by its drums and fifes,"
8603,PART II,"which it assisted with song. As we drew nearer we caught the words, for"
8604,PART II,they were launched with intention:—
8605,PART II,
8606,PART II,’Oo is it mashes the country nurse?
8607,PART II,The Guardsman!
8608,PART II,’Oo is it takes the lydy’s purse?
8609,PART II,The Guardsman!
8610,PART II,"Calls for a drink, and a mild cigar,"
8611,PART II,"Batters a sovereign down on the bar,"
8612,PART II,Collars the change and says “Ta-ta!”
8613,PART II,The Guardsman!
8614,PART II,
8615,PART II,
8616,PART II,"“Why, that’s one of old Jemmy Fawne’s songs. I haven’t heard it in"
8617,PART II,"ages,” I began."
8618,PART II,
8619,PART II,“Little devils!” said Pigeon. “Speshul! Extra speshul! Sports Edition!”
8620,PART II,"a newsboy cried. “’Ere y’are, Captain. Defeat o’ the Guard!”"
8621,PART II,
8622,PART II,"“I’ll buy a copy,” said the Boy, as Pigeon blushed wrathfully. “I must,"
8623,PART II,to see how the Dove lost his mounted company.” He unfolded the flapping
8624,PART II,sheet and we crowded round it.
8625,PART II,
8626,PART II,"“‘_Complete Rout of the Guard,_’” he read. “‘_Too Narrow a Front._’"
8627,PART II,"That’s one for you, Vee! ‘_Attack Anticipated by Mr. Levitt, B. A._’"
8628,PART II,Aha! ‘_The Schools Stand Fast._’”
8629,PART II,
8630,PART II,"“Here’s another version,” said Kyd, waving a tinted sheet. “‘_To your"
8631,PART II,"tents, O Israel! The Hebrew Schools stop the Mounted Troops._’ Pij,"
8632,PART II,were you scuppered by Jewboys?”
8633,PART II,
8634,PART II,"“‘_Umpires Decide all Four Guns Lost,_’” Bayley went on. “By Jove,"
8635,PART II,"there’ll have to be an inquiry into this regrettable incident, Vee!”"
8636,PART II,
8637,PART II,"“I’ll never try to amuse the kids again,” said the baited Verschoyle."
8638,PART II,“Children and newspapers are low things…. And I was hit on the nose by
8639,PART II,"a wad, too! They oughtn’t to be allowed blank ammunition!”"
8640,PART II,
8641,PART II,So we leaned against the railings in the warm twilight haze while the
8642,PART II,"battalion, silently as a shadow, formed up behind us ready to be taken"
8643,PART II,"over. The heat, the hum of the great city, as it might have been the"
8644,PART II,"hum of a camped army, the creaking of the belts, and the well-known"
8645,PART II,"faces bent above them, brought back to me the memory of another"
8646,PART II,"evening, years ago, when Verschoyle and I waited for news of guns"
8647,PART II,missing in no sham fight.
8648,PART II,
8649,PART II,"“A regular Sanna’s Post, isn’t it?” I said at last. “D’you remember,"
8650,PART II,Vee—by the market-square—that night when the wagons went out?”
8651,PART II,
8652,PART II,"Then it came upon me, with no horror, but a certain mild wonder, that"
8653,PART II,"we had waited, Vee and I, that night for the body of Boy Bayley; and"
8654,PART II,that Vee himself had died of typhoid in the spring of 1902. The
8655,PART II,"rustling of the papers continued, but Bayley, shifting slightly,"
8656,PART II,revealed to me the three-day old wound on his left side that had soaked
8657,PART II,the ground about him. I saw Pigeon fling up a helpless arm as to guard
8658,PART II,"himself against a spatter of shrapnel, and Luttrell with a foolish"
8659,PART II,tight-lipped smile lurched over all in one jointless piece. Only old
8660,PART II,Vee’s honest face held steady for awhile against the darkness that had
8661,PART II,swallowed up the battalion behind us. Then his jaw dropped and the face
8662,PART II,"stiffened, so that a fly made bold to explore the puffed and scornful"
8663,PART II,nostril.
8664,PART II,
8665,PART II,
8666,PART II,"I waked brushing a fly from my nose, and saw the Club waiter set out"
8667,PART II,the evening papers on the table.

8678,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,
8679,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,
8680,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"Neither the harps nor the crowns amused, nor the cherubs’ dove-winged races—"
8681,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,Holding hands forlornly the Children wandered beneath the Dome;
8682,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"Plucking the radiant robes of the passers by, and with pitiful faces"
8683,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"Begging what Princes and Powers refused:—“Ah, please will you let us go home?”"
8684,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,
8685,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"Over the jewelled floor, nigh weeping, ran to them Mary the Mother,"
8686,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"Kneeled and caressed and made promise with kisses, and drew them along to the gateway—"
8687,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"Yea, the all-iron unbribable Door which Peter must guard and none other."
8688,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"Straightway She took the Keys from his keeping, and opened and freed them straightway."
8689,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,
8690,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"Then to Her Son, Who had seen and smiled, She said: “On the night that I bore Thee"
8691,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,What didst Thou care for a love beyond mine or a heaven that was not my arm?
8692,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"Didst Thou push from the nipple, O Child, to hear the angels adore Thee?"
8693,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,When we two lay in the breath of the kine?” And He said:—“Thou hast done no harm.”
8694,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,
8695,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,"So through the Void the Children ran homeward merrily hand in hand,"
8696,THE RETURN OF THE CHILDREN,Looking neither to left nor right where the breathless Heavens stood still;

8703,“THEY”,“THEY”
8704,“THEY”,
8705,“THEY”,
8706,“THEY”,"One view called me to another; one hill top to its fellow, half across"
8707,“THEY”,"the county, and since I could answer at no more trouble than the"
8708,“THEY”,"snapping forward of a lever, I let the country flow under my wheels."
8709,“THEY”,"The orchid-studded flats of the East gave way to the thyme, ilex, and"
8710,“THEY”,grey grass of the Downs; these again to the rich cornland and fig-trees
8711,“THEY”,"of the lower coast, where you carry the beat of the tide on your left"
8712,“THEY”,hand for fifteen level miles; and when at last I turned inland through
8713,“THEY”,a huddle of rounded hills and woods I had run myself clean out of my
8714,“THEY”,known marks. Beyond that precise hamlet which stands godmother to the
8715,“THEY”,"capital of the United States, I found hidden villages where bees, the"
8716,“THEY”,"only things awake, boomed in eighty-foot lindens that overhung grey"
8717,“THEY”,Norman churches; miraculous brooks diving under stone bridges built for
8718,“THEY”,heavier traffic than would ever vex them again; tithe-barns larger than
8719,“THEY”,"their churches, and an old smithy that cried out aloud how it had once"
8720,“THEY”,been a hall of the Knights of the Temple. Gipsies I found on a common
8721,“THEY”,"where the gorse, bracken, and heath fought it out together up a mile of"
8722,“THEY”,Roman road; and a little farther on I disturbed a red fox rolling
8723,“THEY”,dog-fashion in the naked sunlight.
8724,“THEY”,
8725,“THEY”,As the wooded hills closed about me I stood up in the car to take the
8726,“THEY”,bearings of that great Down whose ringed head is a landmark for fifty
8727,“THEY”,miles across the low countries. I judged that the lie of the country
8728,“THEY”,"would bring me across some westward running road that went to his feet,"
8729,“THEY”,but I did not allow for the confusing veils of the woods. A quick turn
8730,“THEY”,"plunged me first into a green cutting brimful of liquid sunshine, next"
8731,“THEY”,into a gloomy tunnel where last year’s dead leaves whispered and
8732,“THEY”,scuffled about my tyres. The strong hazel stuff meeting overhead had
8733,“THEY”,"not been cut for a couple of generations at least, nor had any axe"
8734,“THEY”,helped the moss-cankered oak and beech to spring above them. Here the
8735,“THEY”,road changed frankly into a carpetted ride on whose brown velvet spent
8736,“THEY”,"primrose-clumps showed like jade, and a few sickly, white-stalked"
8737,“THEY”,bluebells nodded together. As the slope favoured I shut off the power
8738,“THEY”,"and slid over the whirled leaves, expecting every moment to meet a"
8739,“THEY”,"keeper; but I only heard a jay, far off, arguing against the silence"
8740,“THEY”,under the twilight of the trees.
8741,“THEY”,
8742,“THEY”,Still the track descended. I was on the point of reversing and working
8743,“THEY”,"my way back on the second speed ere I ended in some swamp, when I saw"
8744,“THEY”,sunshine through the tangle ahead and lifted the brake.
8745,“THEY”,
8746,“THEY”,It was down again at once. As the light beat across my face my
8747,“THEY”,fore-wheels took the turf of a great still lawn from which sprang
8748,“THEY”,"horsemen ten feet high with levelled lances, monstrous peacocks, and"
8749,“THEY”,"sleek round-headed maids of honour—blue, black, and glistening—all of"
8750,“THEY”,clipped yew. Across the lawn—the marshalled woods besieged it on three
8751,“THEY”,"sides—stood an ancient house of lichened and weather-worn stone, with"
8752,“THEY”,mullioned windows and roofs of rose-red tile. It was flanked by
8753,“THEY”,"semi-circular walls, also rose-red, that closed the lawn on the fourth"
8754,“THEY”,"side, and at their feet a box hedge grew man-high. There were doves on"
8755,“THEY”,"the roof about the slim brick chimneys, and I caught a glimpse of an"
8756,“THEY”,octagonal dove-house behind the screening wall.
8757,“THEY”,
8758,“THEY”,"Here, then, I stayed; a horseman’s green spear laid at my breast; held"
8759,“THEY”,by the exceeding beauty of that jewel in that setting.
8760,“THEY”,
8761,“THEY”,"“If I am not packed off for a trespasser, or if this knight does not"
8762,“THEY”,"ride a wallop at me,” thought I, “Shakespeare and Queen Elizabeth at"
8763,“THEY”,least must come out of that half-open garden door and ask me to tea.”
8764,“THEY”,
8765,“THEY”,"A child appeared at an upper window, and I thought the little thing"
8766,“THEY”,"waved a friendly hand. But it was to call a companion, for presently"
8767,“THEY”,another bright head showed. Then I heard a laugh among the
8768,“THEY”,"yew-peacocks, and turning to make sure (till then I had been watching"
8769,“THEY”,the house only) I saw the silver of a fountain behind a hedge thrown up
8770,“THEY”,against the sun. The doves on the roof cooed to the cooing water; but
8771,“THEY”,between the two notes I caught the utterly happy chuckle of a child
8772,“THEY”,absorbed in some light mischief.
8773,“THEY”,
8774,“THEY”,The garden door—heavy oak sunk deep in the thickness of the wall—opened
8775,“THEY”,further: a woman in a big garden hat set her foot slowly on the
8776,“THEY”,time-hollowed stone step and as slowly walked across the turf. I was
8777,“THEY”,forming some apology when she lifted up her head and I saw that she was
8778,“THEY”,blind.
8779,“THEY”,
8780,“THEY”,"“I heard you,” she said. “Isn’t that a motor car?”"
8781,“THEY”,
8782,“THEY”,“I’m afraid I’ve made a mistake in my road. I should have turned off up
8783,“THEY”,above—I never dreamed”—I began.
8784,“THEY”,
8785,“THEY”,“But I’m very glad. Fancy a motor car coming into the garden! It will
8786,“THEY”,be such a treat——” She turned and made as though looking about her.
8787,“THEY”,“You—you haven’t seen any one have you—perhaps?”
8788,“THEY”,
8789,“THEY”,"“No one to speak to, but the children seemed interested at a distance.”"
8790,“THEY”,
8791,“THEY”,“Which?”
8792,“THEY”,
8793,“THEY”,"“I saw a couple up at the window just now, and I think I heard a little"
8794,“THEY”,chap in the grounds.”
8795,“THEY”,
8796,“THEY”,"“Oh, lucky you!” she cried, and her face brightened. “I hear them, of"
8797,“THEY”,"course, but that’s all. You’ve seen them and heard them?”"
8798,“THEY”,
8799,“THEY”,"“Yes,” I answered. “And if I know anything of children one of them’s"
8800,“THEY”,"having a beautiful time by the fountain yonder. Escaped, I should"
8801,“THEY”,imagine.”
8802,“THEY”,
8803,“THEY”,“You’re fond of children?”
8804,“THEY”,
8805,“THEY”,I gave her one or two reasons why I did not altogether hate them.
8806,“THEY”,
8807,“THEY”,"“Of course, of course,” she said. “Then you understand. Then you won’t"
8808,“THEY”,"think it foolish if I ask you to take your car through the gardens,"
8809,“THEY”,once or twice—quite slowly. I’m sure they’d like to see it. They see so
8810,“THEY”,"little, poor things. One tries to make their life pleasant, but——” she"
8811,“THEY”,threw out her hands towards the woods. “We’re so out of the world
8812,“THEY”,here.”
8813,“THEY”,
8814,“THEY”,"“That will be splendid,” I said. “But I can’t cut up your grass.”"
8815,“THEY”,
8816,“THEY”,"She faced to the right. “Wait a minute,” she said. “We’re at the South"
8817,“THEY”,"gate, aren’t we? Behind those peacocks there’s a flagged path. We call"
8818,“THEY”,"it the Peacock’s Walk. You can’t see it from here, they tell me, but if"
8819,“THEY”,you squeeze along by the edge of the wood you can turn at the first
8820,“THEY”,peacock and get on to the flags.”
8821,“THEY”,
8822,“THEY”,It was sacrilege to wake that dreaming house-front with the clatter of
8823,“THEY”,"machinery, but I swung the car to clear the turf, brushed along the"
8824,“THEY”,edge of the wood and turned in on the broad stone path where the
8825,“THEY”,fountain-basin lay like one star-sapphire.
8826,“THEY”,
8827,“THEY”,"“May I come too?” she cried. “No, please don’t help me. They’ll like it"
8828,“THEY”,better if they see me.”
8829,“THEY”,
8830,“THEY”,"She felt her way lightly to the front of the car, and with one foot on"
8831,“THEY”,"the step she called: “Children, oh, children! Look and see what’s going"
8832,“THEY”,to happen!”
8833,“THEY”,
8834,“THEY”,"The voice would have drawn lost souls from the Pit, for the yearning"
8835,“THEY”,"that underlay its sweetness, and I was not surprised to hear an"
8836,“THEY”,answering shout behind the yews. It must have been the child by the
8837,“THEY”,"fountain, but he fled at our approach, leaving a little toy boat in the"
8838,“THEY”,water. I saw the glint of his blue blouse among the still horsemen.
8839,“THEY”,
8840,“THEY”,Very disposedly we paraded the length of the walk and at her request
8841,“THEY”,"backed again. This time the child had got the better of his panic, but"
8842,“THEY”,stood far off and doubting.
8843,“THEY”,
8844,“THEY”,"“The little fellow’s watching us,” I said. “I wonder if he’d like a"
8845,“THEY”,ride.”
8846,“THEY”,
8847,“THEY”,"“They’re very shy still. Very shy. But, oh, lucky you to be able to see"
8848,“THEY”,them! Let’s listen.”
8849,“THEY”,
8850,“THEY”,"I stopped the machine at once, and the humid stillness, heavy with the"
8851,“THEY”,"scent of box, cloaked us deep. Shears I could hear where some gardener"
8852,“THEY”,was clipping; a mumble of bees and broken voices that might have been
8853,“THEY”,the doves.
8854,“THEY”,
8855,“THEY”,"“Oh, unkind!” she said weariedly."
8856,“THEY”,
8857,“THEY”,“Perhaps they’re only shy of the motor. The little maid at the window
8858,“THEY”,looks tremendously interested.”
8859,“THEY”,
8860,“THEY”,“Yes?” She raised her head. “It was wrong of me to say that. They are
8861,“THEY”,really fond of me. It’s the only thing that makes life worth
8862,“THEY”,"living—when they’re fond of you, isn’t it? I daren’t think what the"
8863,“THEY”,"place would be without them. By the way, is it beautiful?”"
8864,“THEY”,
8865,“THEY”,“I think it is the most beautiful place I have ever seen.”
8866,“THEY”,
8867,“THEY”,"“So they all tell me. I can feel it, of course, but that isn’t quite"
8868,“THEY”,the same thing.”
8869,“THEY”,
8870,“THEY”,"“Then have you never—-?” I began, but stopped abashed."
8871,“THEY”,
8872,“THEY”,“Not since I can remember. It happened when I was only a few months
8873,“THEY”,"old, they tell me. And yet I must remember something, else how could I"
8874,“THEY”,"dream about colours. I see light in my dreams, and colours, but I never"
8875,“THEY”,see _them_. I only hear them just as I do when I’m awake.”
8876,“THEY”,
8877,“THEY”,"“It’s difficult to see faces in dreams. Some people can, but most of us"
8878,“THEY”,"haven’t the gift,” I went on, looking up at the window where the child"
8879,“THEY”,stood all but hidden.
8880,“THEY”,
8881,“THEY”,"“I’ve heard that too,” she said. “And they tell me that one never sees"
8882,“THEY”,a dead person’s face in a dream. Is that true?”
8883,“THEY”,
8884,“THEY”,“I believe it is—now I come to think of it.”
8885,“THEY”,
8886,“THEY”,“But how is it with yourself—yourself?” The blind eyes turned towards
8887,“THEY”,me.
8888,“THEY”,
8889,“THEY”,"“I have never seen the faces of my dead in any dream,” I answered."
8890,“THEY”,
8891,“THEY”,“Then it must be as bad as being blind.”
8892,“THEY”,
8893,“THEY”,The sun had dipped behind the woods and the long shades were possessing
8894,“THEY”,the insolent horsemen one by one. I saw the light die from off the top
8895,“THEY”,of a glossy-leaved lance and all the brave hard green turn to soft
8896,“THEY”,"black. The house, accepting another day at end, as it had accepted an"
8897,“THEY”,"hundred thousand gone, seemed to settle deeper into its rest among the"
8898,“THEY”,shadows.
8899,“THEY”,
8900,“THEY”,“Have you ever wanted to?” she said after the silence.
8901,“THEY”,
8902,“THEY”,"“Very much sometimes,” I replied. The child had left the window as the"
8903,“THEY”,shadows closed upon it.
8904,“THEY”,
8905,“THEY”,"“Ah! So’ve I, but I don’t suppose it’s allowed. … Where d’you live?”"
8906,“THEY”,
8907,“THEY”,"“Quite the other side of the county—sixty miles and more, and I must be"
8908,“THEY”,going back. I’ve come without my big lamp.”
8909,“THEY”,
8910,“THEY”,“But it’s not dark yet. I can feel it.”
8911,“THEY”,
8912,“THEY”,“I’m afraid it will be by the time I get home. Could you lend me
8913,“THEY”,someone to set me on my road at first? I’ve utterly lost myself.”
8914,“THEY”,
8915,“THEY”,“I’ll send Madden with you to the cross-roads. We are so out of the
8916,“THEY”,"world, I don’t wonder you were lost! I’ll guide you round to the front"
8917,“THEY”,"of the house; but you will go slowly, won’t you, till you’re out of the"
8918,“THEY”,"grounds? It isn’t foolish, do you think?”"
8919,“THEY”,
8920,“THEY”,"“I promise you I’ll go like this,” I said, and let the car start"
8921,“THEY”,herself down the flagged path.
8922,“THEY”,
8923,“THEY”,"We skirted the left wing of the house, whose elaborately cast lead"
8924,“THEY”,guttering alone was worth a day’s journey; passed under a great
8925,“THEY”,"rose-grown gate in the red wall, and so round to the high front of the"
8926,“THEY”,house which in beauty and stateliness as much excelled the back as that
8927,“THEY”,all others I had seen.
8928,“THEY”,
8929,“THEY”,“Is it so very beautiful?” she said wistfully when she heard my
8930,“THEY”,raptures. “And you like the lead-figures too? There’s the old azalea
8931,“THEY”,garden behind. They say that this place must have been made for
8932,“THEY”,"children. Will you help me out, please? I should like to come with you"
8933,“THEY”,"as far as the cross-roads, but I mustn’t leave them. Is that you,"
8934,“THEY”,Madden? I want you to show this gentleman the way to the cross-roads.
8935,“THEY”,He has lost his way but—he has seen them.”
8936,“THEY”,
8937,“THEY”,A butler appeared noiselessly at the miracle of old oak that must be
8938,“THEY”,"called the front door, and slipped aside to put on his hat. She stood"
8939,“THEY”,"looking at me with open blue eyes in which no sight lay, and I saw for"
8940,“THEY”,the first time that she was beautiful.
8941,“THEY”,
8942,“THEY”,"“Remember,” she said quietly, “if you are fond of them you will come"
8943,“THEY”,"again,” and disappeared within the house."
8944,“THEY”,
8945,“THEY”,The butler in the car said nothing till we were nearly at the lodge
8946,“THEY”,"gates, where catching a glimpse of a blue blouse in a shrubbery I"
8947,“THEY”,swerved amply lest the devil that leads little boys to play should drag
8948,“THEY”,me into child-murder.
8949,“THEY”,
8950,“THEY”,"“Excuse me,” he asked of a sudden, “but why did you do that, Sir?”"
8951,“THEY”,
8952,“THEY”,“The child yonder.”
8953,“THEY”,
8954,“THEY”,“Our young gentleman in blue?”
8955,“THEY”,
8956,“THEY”,“Of course.”
8957,“THEY”,
8958,“THEY”,"“He runs about a good deal. Did you see him by the fountain, Sir?”"
8959,“THEY”,
8960,“THEY”,"“Oh, yes, several times. Do we turn here?”"
8961,“THEY”,
8962,“THEY”,"“Yes, Sir. And did you ’appen to see them upstairs too?”"
8963,“THEY”,
8964,“THEY”,“At the upper window? Yes.”
8965,“THEY”,
8966,“THEY”,"“Was that before the mistress come out to speak to you, Sir?”"
8967,“THEY”,
8968,“THEY”,“A little before that. Why d’you want to know?”
8969,“THEY”,
8970,“THEY”,"He paused a little. “Only to make sure that—that they had seen the car,"
8971,“THEY”,"Sir, because with children running about, though I’m sure you’re"
8972,“THEY”,"driving particularly careful, there might be an accident. That was all,"
8973,“THEY”,Sir. Here are the cross-roads. You can’t miss your way from now on.
8974,“THEY”,"Thank you, Sir, but that isn’t _our_ custom, not with——”"
8975,“THEY”,
8976,“THEY”,"“I beg your pardon,” I said, and thrust away the British silver."
8977,“THEY”,
8978,“THEY”,"“Oh, it’s quite right with the rest of ’em as a rule. Goodbye, Sir.”"
8979,“THEY”,
8980,“THEY”,He retired into the armour-plated conning tower of his caste and walked
8981,“THEY”,"away. Evidently a butler solicitous for the honour of his house, and"
8982,“THEY”,"interested, probably through a maid, in the nursery."
8983,“THEY”,
8984,“THEY”,"Once beyond the signposts at the cross-roads I looked back, but the"
8985,“THEY”,crumpled hills interlaced so jealously that I could not see where the
8986,“THEY”,"house had lain. When I asked its name at a cottage along the road, the"
8987,“THEY”,fat woman who sold sweetmeats there gave me to understand that people
8988,“THEY”,with motor cars had small right to live—much less to “go about talking
8989,“THEY”,like carriage folk.” They were not a pleasant-mannered community.
8990,“THEY”,
8991,“THEY”,When I retraced my route on the map that evening I was little wiser.
8992,“THEY”,"Hawkin’s Old Farm appeared to be the survey title of the place, and the"
8993,“THEY”,"old County Gazetteer, generally so ample, did not allude to it. The big"
8994,“THEY”,"house of those parts was Hodnington Hall, Georgian with early Victorian"
8995,“THEY”,"embellishments, as an atrocious steel engraving attested. I carried my"
8996,“THEY”,difficulty to a neighbour—a deep-rooted tree of that soil—and he gave
8997,“THEY”,me a name of a family which conveyed no meaning.
8998,“THEY”,
8999,“THEY”,"A month or so later—I went again, or it may have been that my car took"
9000,“THEY”,"the road of her own volition. She over-ran the fruitless Downs,"
9001,“THEY”,"threaded every turn of the maze of lanes below the hills, drew through"
9002,“THEY”,"the high-walled woods, impenetrable in their full leaf, came out at the"
9003,“THEY”,"cross roads where the butler had left me, and a little further on"
9004,“THEY”,developed an internal trouble which forced me to turn her in on a grass
9005,“THEY”,way-waste that cut into a summer-silent hazel wood. So far as I could
9006,“THEY”,"make sure by the sun and a six-inch Ordnance map, this should be the"
9007,“THEY”,road flank of that wood which I had first explored from the heights
9008,“THEY”,above. I made a mighty serious business of my repairs and a glittering
9009,“THEY”,"shop of my repair kit, spanners, pump, and the like, which I spread out"
9010,“THEY”,"orderly upon a rug. It was a trap to catch all childhood, for on such a"
9011,“THEY”,"day, I argued, the children would not be far off. When I paused in my"
9012,“THEY”,"work I listened, but the wood was so full of the noises of summer"
9013,“THEY”,(though the birds had mated) that I could not at first distinguish
9014,“THEY”,these from the tread of small cautious feet stealing across the dead
9015,“THEY”,"leaves. I rang my bell in an alluring manner, but the feet fled, and I"
9016,“THEY”,"repented, for to a child a sudden noise is very real terror. I must"
9017,“THEY”,have been at work half an hour when I heard in the wood the voice of
9018,“THEY”,"the blind woman crying: “Children, oh children, where are you?” and the"
9019,“THEY”,stillness made slow to close on the perfection of that cry. She came
9020,“THEY”,"towards me, half feeling her way between the tree boles, and though a"
9021,“THEY”,"child it seemed clung to her skirt, it swerved into the leafage like a"
9022,“THEY”,rabbit as she drew nearer.
9023,“THEY”,
9024,“THEY”,"“Is that you?” she said, “from the other side of the county?”"
9025,“THEY”,
9026,“THEY”,"“Yes, it’s me from the other side of the county.”"
9027,“THEY”,
9028,“THEY”,“Then why didn’t you come through the upper woods? They were there just
9029,“THEY”,now.”
9030,“THEY”,
9031,“THEY”,“They were here a few minutes ago. I expect they knew my car had broken
9032,“THEY”,"down, and came to see the fun.”"
9033,“THEY”,
9034,“THEY”,"“Nothing serious, I hope? How do cars break down?”"
9035,“THEY”,
9036,“THEY”,“In fifty different ways. Only mine has chosen the fifty first.”
9037,“THEY”,
9038,“THEY”,"She laughed merrily at the tiny joke, cooed with delicious laughter,"
9039,“THEY”,and pushed her hat back.
9040,“THEY”,
9041,“THEY”,"“Let me hear,” she said."
9042,“THEY”,
9043,“THEY”,"“Wait a moment,” I cried, “and I’ll get you a cushion.”"
9044,“THEY”,
9045,“THEY”,"She set her foot on the rug all covered with spare parts, and stooped"
9046,“THEY”,above it eagerly. “What delightful things!” The hands through which she
9047,“THEY”,saw glanced in the chequered sunlight. “A box here—another box! Why
9048,“THEY”,you’ve arranged them like playing shop!”
9049,“THEY”,
9050,“THEY”,“I confess now that I put it out to attract them. I don’t need half
9051,“THEY”,those things really.”
9052,“THEY”,
9053,“THEY”,“How nice of you! I heard your bell in the upper wood. You say they
9054,“THEY”,were here before that?”
9055,“THEY”,
9056,“THEY”,“I’m sure of it. Why are they so shy? That little fellow in blue who
9057,“THEY”,was with you just now ought to have got over his fright. He’s been
9058,“THEY”,watching me like a Red Indian.”
9059,“THEY”,
9060,“THEY”,"“It must have been your bell,” she said. “I heard one of them go past"
9061,“THEY”,me in trouble when I was coming down. They’re shy—so shy even with me.”
9062,“THEY”,"She turned her face over her shoulder and cried again: “Children! Oh,"
9063,“THEY”,children! Look and see!”
9064,“THEY”,
9065,“THEY”,"“They must have gone off together on their own affairs,” I suggested,"
9066,“THEY”,for there was a murmur behind us of lowered voices broken by the sudden
9067,“THEY”,squeaking giggles of childhood. I returned to my tinkerings and she
9068,“THEY”,"leaned forward, her chin on her hand, listening interestedly."
9069,“THEY”,
9070,“THEY”,"“How many are they?” I said at last. The work was finished, but I saw"
9071,“THEY”,no reason to go.
9072,“THEY”,
9073,“THEY”,"Her forehead puckered a little in thought. “I don’t quite know,” she"
9074,“THEY”,said simply. “Sometimes more—sometimes less. They come and stay with me
9075,“THEY”,"because I love them, you see.”"
9076,“THEY”,
9077,“THEY”,"“That must be very jolly,” I said, replacing a drawer, and as I spoke I"
9078,“THEY”,heard the inanity of my answer.
9079,“THEY”,
9080,“THEY”,"“You—you aren’t laughing at me,” she cried. “I—I haven’t any of my own."
9081,“THEY”,I never married. People laugh at me sometimes about them
9082,“THEY”,because—because———”
9083,“THEY”,
9084,“THEY”,"“Because they’re savages,” I returned. “It’s nothing to fret for. That"
9085,“THEY”,sort laugh at everything that isn’t in their own fat lives.”
9086,“THEY”,
9087,“THEY”,“I don’t know. How should I? I only don’t like being laughed at about
9088,“THEY”,"_them_. It hurts; and when one can’t see…. I don’t want to seem silly,”"
9089,“THEY”,"her chin quivered like a child’s as she spoke, “but we blindies have"
9090,“THEY”,"only one skin, I think. Everything outside hits straight at our souls."
9091,“THEY”,It’s different with you. You’ve such good defences in your eyes—looking
9092,“THEY”,out—before anyone can really pain you in your soul. People forget that
9093,“THEY”,with us.”
9094,“THEY”,
9095,“THEY”,I was silent reviewing that inexhaustible matter—the more than
9096,“THEY”,inherited (since it is also carefully taught) brutality of the
9097,“THEY”,"Christian peoples, beside which the mere heathendom of the West Coast"
9098,“THEY”,nigger is clean and restrained. It led me a long distance into myself.
9099,“THEY”,
9100,“THEY”,"“Don’t do that!” she said of a sudden, putting her hands before her"
9101,“THEY”,eyes.
9102,“THEY”,
9103,“THEY”,“What?”
9104,“THEY”,
9105,“THEY”,She made a gesture with her hand.
9106,“THEY”,
9107,“THEY”,“That! It’s—it’s all purple and black. Don’t! That colour hurts.”
9108,“THEY”,
9109,“THEY”,"“But, how in the world do you know about colours?” I exclaimed, for"
9110,“THEY”,here was a revelation indeed.
9111,“THEY”,
9112,“THEY”,“Colours as colours?” she asked.
9113,“THEY”,
9114,“THEY”,“No. _Those_ Colours which you saw just now.”
9115,“THEY”,
9116,“THEY”,"“You know as well as I do,” she laughed, “else you wouldn’t have asked"
9117,“THEY”,that question. They aren’t in the world at all. They’re in _you_—when
9118,“THEY”,you went so angry.”
9119,“THEY”,
9120,“THEY”,"“D’you mean a dull purplish patch, like port-wine mixed with ink?” I"
9121,“THEY”,said.
9122,“THEY”,
9123,“THEY”,"“I’ve never seen ink or port-wine, but the colours aren’t mixed. They"
9124,“THEY”,are separate—all separate.”
9125,“THEY”,
9126,“THEY”,“Do you mean black streaks and jags across the purple?”
9127,“THEY”,
9128,“THEY”,"She nodded. “Yes—if they are like this,” and zigzagged her finger"
9129,“THEY”,"again, “but it’s more red than purple—that bad colour.”"
9130,“THEY”,
9131,“THEY”,“And what are the colours at the top of the—whatever you see?”
9132,“THEY”,
9133,“THEY”,Slowly she leaned forward and traced on the rug the figure of the Egg
9134,“THEY”,itself.
9135,“THEY”,
9136,“THEY”,"“I see them so,” she said, pointing with a grass stem, “white, green,"
9137,“THEY”,"yellow, red, purple, and when people are angry or bad, black across the"
9138,“THEY”,red—as you were just now.”
9139,“THEY”,
9140,“THEY”,“Who told you anything about it—in the beginning?” I demanded.
9141,“THEY”,
9142,“THEY”,“About the colours? No one. I used to ask what colours were when I was
9143,“THEY”,"little—in table-covers and curtains and carpets, you see—because some"
9144,“THEY”,colours hurt me and some made me happy. People told me; and when I got
9145,“THEY”,older that was how I saw people.” Again she traced the outline of the
9146,“THEY”,Egg which it is given to very few of us to see.
9147,“THEY”,
9148,“THEY”,“All by yourself?” I repeated.
9149,“THEY”,
9150,“THEY”,“All by myself. There wasn’t anyone else. I only found out afterwards
9151,“THEY”,that other people did not see the Colours.”
9152,“THEY”,
9153,“THEY”,She leaned against the tree-hole plaiting and unplaiting chance-plucked
9154,“THEY”,grass stems. The children in the wood had drawn nearer. I could see
9155,“THEY”,them with the tail of my eye frolicking like squirrels.
9156,“THEY”,
9157,“THEY”,"“Now I am sure you will never laugh at me,” she went on after a long"
9158,“THEY”,silence. “Nor at _them_.”
9159,“THEY”,
9160,“THEY”,"“Goodness! No!” I cried, jolted out of my train of thought. “A man who"
9161,“THEY”,laughs at a child—unless the child is laughing too—is a heathen!”
9162,“THEY”,
9163,“THEY”,"“I didn’t mean that of course. You’d never laugh _at_ children, but I"
9164,“THEY”,thought—I used to think—that perhaps you might laugh about _them_. So
9165,“THEY”,now I beg your pardon…. What are you going to laugh at?”
9166,“THEY”,
9167,“THEY”,"I had made no sound, but she knew."
9168,“THEY”,
9169,“THEY”,“At the notion of your begging my pardon. If you had done your duty as
9170,“THEY”,a pillar of the state and a landed proprietress you ought to have
9171,“THEY”,summoned me for trespass when I barged through your woods the other
9172,“THEY”,day. It was disgraceful of me—inexcusable.”
9173,“THEY”,
9174,“THEY”,"She looked at me, her head against the tree trunk—long and"
9175,“THEY”,steadfastly—this woman who could see the naked soul.
9176,“THEY”,
9177,“THEY”,"“How curious,” she half whispered. “How very curious.”"
9178,“THEY”,
9179,“THEY”,"“Why, what have I done?”"
9180,“THEY”,
9181,“THEY”,“You don’t understand … and yet you understood about the Colours. Don’t
9182,“THEY”,you understand?”
9183,“THEY”,
9184,“THEY”,"She spoke with a passion that nothing had justified, and I faced her"
9185,“THEY”,bewilderedly as she rose. The children had gathered themselves in a
9186,“THEY”,roundel behind a bramble bush. One sleek head bent over something
9187,“THEY”,"smaller, and the set of the little shoulders told me that fingers were"
9188,“THEY”,"on lips. They, too, had some child’s tremendous secret. I alone was"
9189,“THEY”,hopelessly astray there in the broad sunlight.
9190,“THEY”,
9191,“THEY”,"“No,” I said, and shook my head as though the dead eyes could note."
9192,“THEY”,"“Whatever it is, I don’t understand yet. Perhaps I shall later—if"
9193,“THEY”,you’ll let me come again.”
9194,“THEY”,
9195,“THEY”,"“You will come again,” she answered. “You will surely come again and"
9196,“THEY”,walk in the wood.”
9197,“THEY”,
9198,“THEY”,“Perhaps the children will know me well enough by that time to let me
9199,“THEY”,play with them—as a favour. You know what children are like.”
9200,“THEY”,
9201,“THEY”,"“It isn’t a matter of favour but of right,” she replied, and while I"
9202,“THEY”,"wondered what she meant, a dishevelled woman plunged round the bend of"
9203,“THEY”,"the road, loose-haired, purple, almost lowing with agony as she ran. It"
9204,“THEY”,"was my rude, fat friend of the sweetmeat shop. The blind woman heard"
9205,“THEY”,"and stepped forward. “What is it, Mrs. Madehurst?” she asked."
9206,“THEY”,
9207,“THEY”,The woman flung her apron over her head and literally grovelled in the
9208,“THEY”,"dust, crying that her grandchild was sick to death, that the local"
9209,“THEY”,"doctor was away fishing, that Jenny the mother was at her wits end, and"
9210,“THEY”,"so forth, with repetitions and bellowings."
9211,“THEY”,
9212,“THEY”,“Where’s the next nearest doctor?” I asked between paroxysms.
9213,“THEY”,
9214,“THEY”,“Madden will tell you. Go round to the house and take him with you.
9215,“THEY”,I’ll attend to this. Be quick!” She half-supported the fat woman into
9216,“THEY”,the shade. In two minutes I was blowing all the horns of Jericho under
9217,“THEY”,"the front of the House Beautiful, and Madden, in the pantry, rose to"
9218,“THEY”,the crisis like a butler and a man.
9219,“THEY”,
9220,“THEY”,A quarter of an hour at illegal speeds caught us a doctor five miles
9221,“THEY”,"away. Within the half-hour we had decanted him, much interested in"
9222,“THEY”,"motors, at the door of the sweetmeat shop, and drew up the road to"
9223,“THEY”,await the verdict.
9224,“THEY”,
9225,“THEY”,"“Useful things cars,” said Madden, all man and no butler. “If I’d had"
9226,“THEY”,one when mine took sick she wouldn’t have died.”
9227,“THEY”,
9228,“THEY”,“How was it?” I asked.
9229,“THEY”,
9230,“THEY”,“Croup. Mrs. Madden was away. No one knew what to do. I drove eight
9231,“THEY”,miles in a tax cart for the doctor. She was choked when we came back.
9232,“THEY”,This car ’d ha’ saved her. She’d have been close on ten now.”
9233,“THEY”,
9234,“THEY”,"“I’m sorry,” I said. “I thought you were rather fond of children from"
9235,“THEY”,what you told me going to the cross-roads the other day.”
9236,“THEY”,
9237,“THEY”,"“Have you seen ’em again, Sir—this mornin’?”"
9238,“THEY”,
9239,“THEY”,"“Yes, but they’re well broke to cars. I couldn’t get any of them within"
9240,“THEY”,twenty yards of it.”
9241,“THEY”,
9242,“THEY”,He looked at me carefully as a scout considers a stranger—not as a
9243,“THEY”,menial should lift his eyes to his divinely appointed superior.
9244,“THEY”,
9245,“THEY”,"“I wonder why,” he said just above the breath that he drew."
9246,“THEY”,
9247,“THEY”,We waited on. A light wind from the sea wandered up and down the long
9248,“THEY”,"lines of the woods, and the wayside grasses, whitened already with"
9249,“THEY”,"summer dust, rose and bowed in sallow waves."
9250,“THEY”,
9251,“THEY”,"A woman, wiping the suds off her arms, came out of the cottage next the"
9252,“THEY”,sweetmeat shop.
9253,“THEY”,
9254,“THEY”,"“I’ve be’n listenin’ in de back-yard,” she said cheerily. “He says"
9255,“THEY”,Arthur’s unaccountable bad. Did ye hear him shruck just now?
9256,“THEY”,Unaccountable bad. I reckon t’will come Jenny’s turn to walk in de wood
9257,“THEY”,"nex’ week along, Mr. Madden.”"
9258,“THEY”,
9259,“THEY”,"“Excuse me, Sir, but your lap-robe is slipping,” said Madden"
9260,“THEY”,"deferentially. The woman started, dropped a curtsey, and hurried away."
9261,“THEY”,
9262,“THEY”,“What does she mean by ‘walking in the wood’?” I asked.
9263,“THEY”,
9264,“THEY”,"“It must be some saying they use hereabouts. I’m from Norfolk myself,”"
9265,“THEY”,said Madden. “They’re an independent lot in this county. She took you
9266,“THEY”,"for a chauffeur, Sir.”"
9267,“THEY”,
9268,“THEY”,I saw the Doctor come out of the cottage followed by a draggle-tailed
9269,“THEY”,wench who clung to his arm as though he could make treaty for her with
9270,“THEY”,"Death. “Dat sort,” she wailed—“dey’re just as much to us dat has ’em as"
9271,“THEY”,if dey was lawful born. Just as much—just as much! An’ God he’d be just
9272,“THEY”,"as pleased if you saved ’un, Doctor. Don’t take it from me. Miss"
9273,“THEY”,"Florence will tell ye de very same. Don’t leave ’im, Doctor!”"
9274,“THEY”,
9275,“THEY”,"“I know. I know,” said the man, “but he’ll be quiet for a while now."
9276,“THEY”,We’ll get the nurse and the medicine as fast as we can.” He signalled
9277,“THEY”,"me to come forward with the car, and I strove not to be privy to what"
9278,“THEY”,"followed; but I saw the girl’s face, blotched and frozen with grief,"
9279,“THEY”,and I felt the hand without a ring clutching at my knees when we moved
9280,“THEY”,away.
9281,“THEY”,
9282,“THEY”,"The Doctor was a man of some humour, for I remember he claimed my car"
9283,“THEY”,"under the Oath of Æsculapius, and used it and me without mercy. First"
9284,“THEY”,we convoyed Mrs. Madehurst and the blind woman to wait by the sick bed
9285,“THEY”,till the nurse should come. Next we invaded a neat county town for
9286,“THEY”,prescriptions (the Doctor said the trouble was cerebro-spinal
9287,“THEY”,"meningitis), and when the County Institute, banked and flanked with"
9288,“THEY”,"scared market cattle, reported itself out of nurses for the moment we"
9289,“THEY”,literally flung ourselves loose upon the county. We conferred with the
9290,“THEY”,owners of great houses—magnates at the ends of overarching avenues
9291,“THEY”,whose big-boned womenfolk strode away from their tea-tables to listen
9292,“THEY”,to the imperious Doctor. At last a white-haired lady sitting under a
9293,“THEY”,cedar of Lebanon and surrounded by a court of magnificent Borzois—all
9294,“THEY”,"hostile to motors—gave the Doctor, who received them as from a"
9295,“THEY”,"princess, written orders which we bore many miles at top speed, through"
9296,“THEY”,"a park, to a French nunnery, where we took over in exchange a"
9297,“THEY”,pallid-faced and trembling Sister. She knelt at the bottom of the
9298,“THEY”,"tonneau telling her beads without pause till, by short cuts of the"
9299,“THEY”,"Doctor’s invention, we had her to the sweetmeat shop once more. It was"
9300,“THEY”,a long afternoon crowded with mad episodes that rose and dissolved like
9301,“THEY”,the dust of our wheels; cross-sections of remote and incomprehensible
9302,“THEY”,lives through which we raced at right angles; and I went home in the
9303,“THEY”,"dusk, wearied out, to dream of the clashing horns of cattle; round-eyed"
9304,“THEY”,nuns walking in a garden of graves; pleasant tea-parties beneath shaded
9305,“THEY”,"trees; the carbolic-scented, grey-painted corridors of the County"
9306,“THEY”,"Institute; the steps of shy children in the wood, and the hands that"
9307,“THEY”,clung to my knees as the motor began to move.
9308,“THEY”,
9309,“THEY”,
9310,“THEY”,"I had intended to return in a day or two, but it pleased Fate to hold"
9311,“THEY”,"me from that side of the county, on many pretexts, till the elder and"
9312,“THEY”,"the wild rose had fruited. There came at last a brilliant day, swept"
9313,“THEY”,"clear from the south-west, that brought the hills within hand’s reach—a"
9314,“THEY”,day of unstable airs and high filmy clouds. Through no merit of my own
9315,“THEY”,"I was free, and set the car for the third time on that known road. As I"
9316,“THEY”,"reached the crest of the Downs I felt the soft air change, saw it glaze"
9317,“THEY”,"under the sun; and, looking down at the sea, in that instant beheld the"
9318,“THEY”,blue of the Channel turn through polished silver and dulled steel to
9319,“THEY”,dingy pewter. A laden collier hugging the coast steered outward for
9320,“THEY”,"deeper water and, across copper-coloured haze, I saw sails rise one by"
9321,“THEY”,one on the anchored fishing-fleet. In a deep dene behind me an eddy of
9322,“THEY”,"sudden wind drummed through sheltered oaks, and spun aloft the first"
9323,“THEY”,day sample of autumn leaves. When I reached the beach road the sea-fog
9324,“THEY”,"fumed over the brickfields, and the tide was telling all the groins of"
9325,“THEY”,the gale beyond Ushant. In less than an hour summer England vanished in
9326,“THEY”,"chill grey. We were again the shut island of the North, all the ships"
9327,“THEY”,of the world bellowing at our perilous gates; and between their
9328,“THEY”,"outcries ran the piping of bewildered gulls. My cap dripped moisture,"
9329,“THEY”,"the folds of the rug held it in pools or sluiced it away in runnels,"
9330,“THEY”,and the salt-rime stuck to my lips.
9331,“THEY”,
9332,“THEY”,"Inland the smell of autumn loaded the thickened fog among the trees,"
9333,“THEY”,and the drip became a continuous shower. Yet the late flowers—mallow of
9334,“THEY”,"the wayside, scabious of the field, and dahlia of the garden—showed gay"
9335,“THEY”,"in the mist, and beyond the sea’s breath there was little sign of decay"
9336,“THEY”,"in the leaf. Yet in the villages the house doors were all open, and"
9337,“THEY”,"bare-legged, bare-headed children sat at ease on the damp doorsteps to"
9338,“THEY”,shout “pip-pip” at the stranger.
9339,“THEY”,
9340,“THEY”,"I made bold to call at the sweetmeat shop, where Mrs. Madehurst met me"
9341,“THEY”,"with a fat woman’s hospitable tears. Jenny’s child, she said, had died"
9342,“THEY”,"two days after the nun had come. It was, she felt, best out of the way,"
9343,“THEY”,"even though insurance offices, for reasons which she did not pretend to"
9344,“THEY”,"follow, would not willingly insure such stray lives. “Not but what"
9345,“THEY”,Jenny didn’t tend to Arthur as though he’d come all proper at de end of
9346,“THEY”,"de first year—like Jenny herself.” Thanks to Miss Florence, the child"
9347,“THEY”,"had been buried with a pomp which, in Mrs. Madehurst’s opinion, more"
9348,“THEY”,than covered the small irregularity of its birth. She described the
9349,“THEY”,"coffin, within and without, the glass hearse, and the evergreen lining"
9350,“THEY”,of the grave.
9351,“THEY”,
9352,“THEY”,“But how’s the mother?” I asked.
9353,“THEY”,
9354,“THEY”,"“Jenny? Oh, she’ll get over it. I’ve felt dat way with one or two o’ my"
9355,“THEY”,own. She’ll get over. She’s walkin’ in de wood now.”
9356,“THEY”,
9357,“THEY”,“In this weather?”
9358,“THEY”,
9359,“THEY”,Mrs. Madehurst looked at me with narrowed eyes across the counter.
9360,“THEY”,
9361,“THEY”,"“I dunno but it opens de ’eart like. Yes, it opens de ’eart. Dat’s"
9362,“THEY”,"where losin’ and bearin’ comes so alike in de long run, we do say.”"
9363,“THEY”,
9364,“THEY”,Now the wisdom of the old wives is greater than that of all the
9365,“THEY”,"Fathers, and this last oracle sent me thinking so extendedly as I went"
9366,“THEY”,"up the road, that I nearly ran over a woman and a child at the wooded"
9367,“THEY”,corner by the lodge gates of the House Beautiful.
9368,“THEY”,
9369,“THEY”,"“Awful weather!” I cried, as I slowed dead for the turn."
9370,“THEY”,
9371,“THEY”,"“Not so bad,” she answered placidly out of the fog. “Mine’s used to"
9372,“THEY”,"’un. You’ll find yours indoors, I reckon.”"
9373,“THEY”,
9374,“THEY”,"Indoors, Madden received me with professional courtesy, and kind"
9375,“THEY”,"inquiries for the health of the motor, which he would put under cover."
9376,“THEY”,
9377,“THEY”,"I waited in a still, nut-brown hall, pleasant with late flowers and"
9378,“THEY”,warmed with a delicious wood fire—a place of good influence and great
9379,“THEY”,"peace. (Men and women may sometimes, after great effort, achieve a"
9380,“THEY”,"creditable lie; but the house, which is their temple, cannot say"
9381,“THEY”,anything save the truth of those who have lived in it.) A child’s cart
9382,“THEY”,"and a doll lay on the black-and-white floor, where a rug had been"
9383,“THEY”,kicked back. I felt that the children had only just hurried away—to
9384,“THEY”,"hide themselves, most like—in the many turns of the great adzed"
9385,“THEY”,"staircase that climbed statelily out of the hall, or to crouch at gaze"
9386,“THEY”,behind the lions and roses of the carven gallery above. Then I heard
9387,“THEY”,"her voice above me, singing as the blind sing—from the soul:—"
9388,“THEY”,
9389,“THEY”,In the pleasant orchard-closes.
9390,“THEY”,
9391,“THEY”,
9392,“THEY”,And all my early summer came back at the call.
9393,“THEY”,
9394,“THEY”,"In the pleasant orchard-closes,"
9395,“THEY”,God bless all our gains say we—
9396,“THEY”,"But may God bless all our losses,"
9397,“THEY”,"Better suits with our degree,"
9398,“THEY”,
9399,“THEY”,
9400,“THEY”,"She dropped the marring fifth line, and repeated—"
9401,“THEY”,
9402,“THEY”,Better suits with our degree!
9403,“THEY”,
9404,“THEY”,
9405,“THEY”,"I saw her lean over the gallery, her linked hands white as pearl"
9406,“THEY”,against the oak.
9407,“THEY”,
9408,“THEY”,“Is that you—from the other side of the county?” she called.
9409,“THEY”,
9410,“THEY”,"“Yes, me—from the other side of the county,” I answered laughing."
9411,“THEY”,
9412,“THEY”,“What a long time before you had to come here again.” She ran down the
9413,“THEY”,"stairs, one hand lightly touching the broad rail. “It’s two months and"
9414,“THEY”,four days. Summer’s gone!”
9415,“THEY”,
9416,“THEY”,"“I meant to come before, but Fate prevented.”"
9417,“THEY”,
9418,“THEY”,“I knew it. Please do something to that fire. They won’t let me play
9419,“THEY”,"with it, but I can feel it’s behaving badly. Hit it!”"
9420,“THEY”,
9421,“THEY”,"I looked on either side of the deep fireplace, and found but a"
9422,“THEY”,half-charred hedge-stake with which I punched a black log into flame.
9423,“THEY”,
9424,“THEY”,"“It never goes out, day or night,” she said, as though explaining. “In"
9425,“THEY”,"case any one comes in with cold toes, you see.”"
9426,“THEY”,
9427,“THEY”,"“It’s even lovelier inside than it was out,” I murmured. The red light"
9428,“THEY”,poured itself along the age-polished dusky panels till the Tudor roses
9429,“THEY”,and lions of the gallery took colour and motion. An old eagle-topped
9430,“THEY”,"convex mirror gathered the picture into its mysterious heart,"
9431,“THEY”,"distorting afresh the distorted shadows, and curving the gallery lines"
9432,“THEY”,into the curves of a ship. The day was shutting down in half a gale as
9433,“THEY”,the fog turned to stringy scud. Through the uncurtained mullions of the
9434,“THEY”,broad window I could see valiant horsemen of the lawn rear and recover
9435,“THEY”,"against the wind that taunted them with legions of dead leaves. “Yes,"
9436,“THEY”,"it must be beautiful,” she said. “Would you like to go over it? There’s"
9437,“THEY”,still light enough upstairs.”
9438,“THEY”,
9439,“THEY”,"I followed her up the unflinching, wagon-wide staircase to the gallery"
9440,“THEY”,whence opened the thin fluted Elizabethan doors.
9441,“THEY”,
9442,“THEY”,“Feel how they put the latch low down for the sake of the children.”
9443,“THEY”,She swung a light door inward.
9444,“THEY”,
9445,“THEY”,"“By the way, where are they?” I asked. “I haven’t even heard them"
9446,“THEY”,to-day.”
9447,“THEY”,
9448,“THEY”,"She did not answer at once. Then, “I can only hear them,” she replied"
9449,“THEY”,"softly. “This is one of their rooms—everything ready, you see.”"
9450,“THEY”,
9451,“THEY”,She pointed into a heavily-timbered room. There were little low gate
9452,“THEY”,"tables and children’s chairs. A doll’s house, its hooked front half"
9453,“THEY”,"open, faced a great dappled rocking-horse, from whose padded saddle it"
9454,“THEY”,was but a child’s scramble to the broad window-seat overlooking the
9455,“THEY”,lawn. A toy gun lay in a corner beside a gilt wooden cannon.
9456,“THEY”,
9457,“THEY”,"“Surely they’ve only just gone,” I whispered. In the failing light a"
9458,“THEY”,door creaked cautiously. I heard the rustle of a frock and the patter
9459,“THEY”,of feet—quick feet through a room beyond.
9460,“THEY”,
9461,“THEY”,"“I heard that,” she cried triumphantly. “Did you? Children, O children,"
9462,“THEY”,where are you?”
9463,“THEY”,
9464,“THEY”,The voice filled the walls that held it lovingly to the last perfect
9465,“THEY”,"note, but there came no answering shout such as I had heard in the"
9466,“THEY”,"garden. We hurried on from room to oak-floored room; up a step here,"
9467,“THEY”,down three steps there; among a maze of passages; always mocked by our
9468,“THEY”,quarry. One might as well have tried to work an unstopped warren with a
9469,“THEY”,"single ferret. There were bolt-holes innumerable—recesses in walls,"
9470,“THEY”,"embrasures of deep slitten windows now darkened, whence they could"
9471,“THEY”,"start up behind us; and abandoned fireplaces, six feet deep in the"
9472,“THEY”,"masonry, as well as the tangle of communicating doors. Above all, they"
9473,“THEY”,had the twilight for their helper in our game. I had caught one or two
9474,“THEY”,"joyous chuckles of evasion, and once or twice had seen the silhouette"
9475,“THEY”,of a child’s frock against some darkening window at the end of a
9476,“THEY”,"passage; but we returned empty-handed to the gallery, just as a"
9477,“THEY”,middle-aged woman was setting a lamp in its niche.
9478,“THEY”,
9479,“THEY”,"“No, I haven’t seen her either this evening, Miss Florence,” I heard"
9480,“THEY”,"her say, “but that Turpin he says he wants to see you about his shed.”"
9481,“THEY”,
9482,“THEY”,"“Oh, Mr. Turpin must want to see me very badly. Tell him to come to the"
9483,“THEY”,"hall, Mrs. Madden.”"
9484,“THEY”,
9485,“THEY”,"I looked down into the hall whose only light was the dulled fire, and"
9486,“THEY”,deep in the shadow I saw them at last. They must have slipped down
9487,“THEY”,"while we were in the passages, and now thought themselves perfectly"
9488,“THEY”,"hidden behind an old gilt leather screen. By child’s law, my fruitless"
9489,“THEY”,"chase was as good as an introduction, but since I had taken so much"
9490,“THEY”,trouble I resolved to force them to come forward later by the simple
9491,“THEY”,"trick, which children detest, of pretending not to notice them. They"
9492,“THEY”,"lay close, in a little huddle, no more than shadows except when a quick"
9493,“THEY”,flame betrayed an outline.
9494,“THEY”,
9495,“THEY”,"“And now we’ll have some tea,” she said. “I believe I ought to have"
9496,“THEY”,"offered it you at first, but one doesn’t arrive at manners somehow when"
9497,“THEY”,one lives alone and is considered—h’m—peculiar.” Then with very pretty
9498,“THEY”,"scorn, “would you like a lamp to see to eat by?”"
9499,“THEY”,
9500,“THEY”,"“The firelight’s much pleasanter, I think.” We descended into that"
9501,“THEY”,delicious gloom and Madden brought tea.
9502,“THEY”,
9503,“THEY”,I took my chair in the direction of the screen ready to surprise or be
9504,“THEY”,"surprised as the game should go, and at her permission, since a hearth"
9505,“THEY”,"is always sacred, bent forward to play with the fire."
9506,“THEY”,
9507,“THEY”,“Where do you get these beautiful short faggots from?” I asked idly.
9508,“THEY”,"“Why, they are tallies!”"
9509,“THEY”,
9510,“THEY”,"“Of course,” she said. “As I can’t read or write I’m driven back on the"
9511,“THEY”,early English tally for my accounts. Give me one and I’ll tell you what
9512,“THEY”,it meant.”
9513,“THEY”,
9514,“THEY”,"I passed her an unburned hazel-tally, about a foot long, and she ran"
9515,“THEY”,her thumb down the nicks.
9516,“THEY”,
9517,“THEY”,“This is the milk-record for the home farm for the month of April last
9518,“THEY”,"year, in gallons,” said she. “I don’t know what I should have done"
9519,“THEY”,without tallies. An old forester of mine taught me the system. It’s out
9520,“THEY”,of date now for every one else; but my tenants respect it. One of
9521,“THEY”,"them’s coming now to see me. Oh, it doesn’t matter. He has no business"
9522,“THEY”,"here out of office hours. He’s a greedy, ignorant man—very greedy or—he"
9523,“THEY”,wouldn’t come here after dark.”
9524,“THEY”,
9525,“THEY”,“Have you much land then?”
9526,“THEY”,
9527,“THEY”,"“Only a couple of hundred acres in hand, thank goodness. The other six"
9528,“THEY”,"hundred are nearly all let to folk who knew my folk before me, but this"
9529,“THEY”,Turpin is quite a new man—and a highway robber.”
9530,“THEY”,
9531,“THEY”,“But are you sure I sha’n’t be——?”
9532,“THEY”,
9533,“THEY”,“Certainly not. You have the right. He hasn’t any children.”
9534,“THEY”,
9535,“THEY”,"“Ah, the children!” I said, and slid my low chair back till it nearly"
9536,“THEY”,touched the screen that hid them. “I wonder whether they’ll come out
9537,“THEY”,for me.”
9538,“THEY”,
9539,“THEY”,"There was a murmur of voices—Madden’s and a deeper note—at the low,"
9540,“THEY”,"dark side door, and a ginger-headed, canvas-gaitered giant of the"
9541,“THEY”,unmistakable tenant farmer type stumbled or was pushed in.
9542,“THEY”,
9543,“THEY”,"“Come to the fire, Mr. Turpin,” she said."
9544,“THEY”,
9545,“THEY”,"“If—if you please, Miss, I’ll—I’ll be quite as well by the door.” He"
9546,“THEY”,clung to the latch as he spoke like a frightened child. Of a sudden I
9547,“THEY”,realised that he was in the grip of some almost overpowering fear.
9548,“THEY”,
9549,“THEY”,“Well?”
9550,“THEY”,
9551,“THEY”,“About that new shed for the young stock—that was all. These first
9552,“THEY”,"autumn storms settin’ in … but I’ll come again, Miss.” His teeth did"
9553,“THEY”,not chatter much more than the door latch.
9554,“THEY”,
9555,“THEY”,"“I think not,” she answered levelly. “The new shed—m’m. What did my"
9556,“THEY”,agent write you on the 15th?”
9557,“THEY”,
9558,“THEY”,"“I—fancied p’raps that if I came to see you—ma—man to man like, Miss."
9559,“THEY”,But——”
9560,“THEY”,
9561,“THEY”,His eyes rolled into every corner of the room wide with horror. He half
9562,“THEY”,"opened the door through which he had entered, but I noticed it shut"
9563,“THEY”,again—from without and firmly.
9564,“THEY”,
9565,“THEY”,"“He wrote what I told him,” she went on. “You are overstocked already."
9566,“THEY”,Dunnett’s Farm never carried more than fifty bullocks—even in Mr.
9567,“THEY”,Wright’s time. And _he_ used cake. You’ve sixty-seven and you don’t
9568,“THEY”,cake. You’ve broken the lease in that respect. You’re dragging the
9569,“THEY”,heart out of the farm.”
9570,“THEY”,
9571,“THEY”,“I’m—I’m getting some minerals—superphosphates—next week. I’ve as good
9572,“THEY”,as ordered a truck-load already. I’ll go down to the station to-morrow
9573,“THEY”,"about ’em. Then I can come and see you man to man like, Miss, in the"
9574,“THEY”,"daylight…. That gentleman’s not going away, is he?” He almost shrieked."
9575,“THEY”,
9576,“THEY”,"I had only slid the chair a little further back, reaching behind me to"
9577,“THEY”,"tap on the leather of the screen, but he jumped like a rat."
9578,“THEY”,
9579,“THEY”,"“No. Please attend to me, Mr. Turpin.” She turned in her chair and"
9580,“THEY”,faced him with his back to the door. It was an old and sordid little
9581,“THEY”,piece of scheming that she forced from him—his plea for the new cowshed
9582,“THEY”,"at his landlady’s expense, that he might with the covered manure pay"
9583,“THEY”,"his next year’s rent out of the valuation after, as she made clear, he"
9584,“THEY”,had bled the enriched pastures to the bone. I could not but admire the
9585,“THEY”,"intensity of his greed, when I saw him out-facing for its sake whatever"
9586,“THEY”,terror it was that ran wet on his forehead.
9587,“THEY”,
9588,“THEY”,"I ceased to tap the leather—was, indeed, calculating the cost of the"
9589,“THEY”,shed—when I felt my relaxed hand taken and turned softly between the
9590,“THEY”,soft hands of a child. So at last I had triumphed. In a moment I would
9591,“THEY”,turn and acquaint myself with those quick-footed wanderers….
9592,“THEY”,
9593,“THEY”,The little brushing kiss fell in the centre of my palm—as a gift on
9594,“THEY”,"which the fingers were, once, expected to close: as the all faithful"
9595,“THEY”,half-reproachful signal of a waiting child not used to neglect even
9596,“THEY”,when grown-ups were busiest—a fragment of the mute code devised very
9597,“THEY”,long ago.
9598,“THEY”,
9599,“THEY”,Then I knew. And it was as though I had known from the first day when I
9600,“THEY”,looked across the lawn at the high window.
9601,“THEY”,
9602,“THEY”,"I heard the door shut. The woman turned to me in silence, and I felt"
9603,“THEY”,that she knew.
9604,“THEY”,
9605,“THEY”,What time passed after this I cannot say. I was roused by the fall of a
9606,“THEY”,"log, and mechanically rose to put it back. Then I returned to my place"
9607,“THEY”,in the chair very close to the screen.
9608,“THEY”,
9609,“THEY”,"“Now you understand,” she whispered, across the packed shadows."
9610,“THEY”,
9611,“THEY”,"“Yes, I understand—now. Thank you.”"
9612,“THEY”,
9613,“THEY”,“I—I only hear them.” She bowed her head in her hands. “I have no
9614,“THEY”,"right, you know—no other right. I have neither borne nor lost—neither"
9615,“THEY”,borne nor lost!”
9616,“THEY”,
9617,“THEY”,"“Be very glad then,” said I, for my soul was torn open within me."
9618,“THEY”,
9619,“THEY”,“Forgive me!”
9620,“THEY”,
9621,“THEY”,"She was still, and I went back to my sorrow and my joy."
9622,“THEY”,
9623,“THEY”,"“It was because I loved them so,” she said at last, brokenly. “_That_"
9624,“THEY”,"was why it was, even from the first—even before I knew that they—they"
9625,“THEY”,were all I should ever have. And I loved them so!”
9626,“THEY”,
9627,“THEY”,She stretched out her arms to the shadows and the shadows within the
9628,“THEY”,shadow.
9629,“THEY”,
9630,“THEY”,“They came because I loved them—because I needed them. I—I must have
9631,“THEY”,"made them come. Was that wrong, think you?”"
9632,“THEY”,
9633,“THEY”,“No—no.”
9634,“THEY”,
9635,“THEY”,“I—I grant you that the toys and—and all that sort of thing were
9636,“THEY”,"nonsense, but—but I used to so hate empty rooms myself when I was"
9637,“THEY”,little.” She pointed to the gallery. “And the passages all empty. … And
9638,“THEY”,how could I ever bear the garden door shut? Suppose——”
9639,“THEY”,
9640,“THEY”,"“Don’t! For pity’s sake, don’t!” I cried. The twilight had brought a"
9641,“THEY”,cold rain with gusty squalls that plucked at the leaded windows.
9642,“THEY”,
9643,“THEY”,“And the same thing with keeping the fire in all night. _I_ don’t think
9644,“THEY”,it so foolish—do you?”
9645,“THEY”,
9646,“THEY”,"I looked at the broad brick hearth, saw, through tears I believe, that"
9647,“THEY”,"there was no unpassable iron on or near it, and bowed my head."
9648,“THEY”,
9649,“THEY”,“I did all that and lots of other things—just to make believe. Then
9650,“THEY”,"they came. I heard them, but I didn’t know that they were not mine by"
9651,“THEY”,right till Mrs. Madden told me——”
9652,“THEY”,
9653,“THEY”,“The butler’s wife? What?”
9654,“THEY”,
9655,“THEY”,“One of them—I heard—she saw. And knew. Hers! _Not_ for me. I didn’t
9656,“THEY”,"know at first. Perhaps I was jealous. Afterwards, I began to understand"
9657,“THEY”,"that it was only because I loved them, not because——… Oh, you _must_"
9658,“THEY”,"bear or lose,” she said piteously. “There is no other way—and yet they"
9659,“THEY”,love me. They must! Don’t they?”
9660,“THEY”,
9661,“THEY”,"There was no sound in the room except the lapping voices of the fire,"
9662,“THEY”,"but we two listened intently, and she at least took comfort from what"
9663,“THEY”,she heard. She recovered herself and half rose. I sat still in my chair
9664,“THEY”,by the screen.
9665,“THEY”,
9666,“THEY”,"“Don’t think me a wretch to whine about myself like this, but—but I’m"
9667,“THEY”,"all in the dark, you know, and _you_ can see.”"
9668,“THEY”,
9669,“THEY”,"In truth I could see, and my vision confirmed me in my resolve, though"
9670,“THEY”,that was like the very parting of spirit and flesh. Yet a little longer
9671,“THEY”,I would stay since it was the last time.
9672,“THEY”,
9673,“THEY”,"“You think it is wrong, then?” she cried sharply, though I had said"
9674,“THEY”,nothing.
9675,“THEY”,
9676,“THEY”,“Not for you. A thousand times no. For you it is right…. I am grateful
9677,“THEY”,to you beyond words. For me it would be wrong. For me only….”
9678,“THEY”,
9679,“THEY”,"“Why?” she said, but passed her hand before her face as she had done at"
9680,“THEY”,"our second meeting in the wood. “Oh, I see,” she went on simply as a"
9681,“THEY”,"child. “For you it would be wrong.” Then with a little indrawn laugh,"
9682,“THEY”,"“and, d’you remember, I called you lucky—once—at first. You who must"
9683,“THEY”,never come here again!”
9684,“THEY”,
9685,“THEY”,"She left me to sit a little longer by the screen, and I heard the sound"
9686,“THEY”,of her feet die out along the gallery above.

9749,MRS. BATHURST,The day that I chose to visit H.M.S. _Peridot_ in Simon’s Bay was the
9750,MRS. BATHURST,day that the Admiral had chosen to send her up the coast. She was just
9751,MRS. BATHURST,"steaming out to sea as my train came in, and since the rest of the"
9752,MRS. BATHURST,Fleet were either coaling or busy at the rifle-ranges a thousand feet
9753,MRS. BATHURST,"up the hill, I found myself stranded, lunchless, on the sea-front with"
9754,MRS. BATHURST,no hope of return to Cape Town before five P.M. At this crisis I had
9755,MRS. BATHURST,"the luck to come across my friend Inspector Hooper, Cape Government"
9756,MRS. BATHURST,"Railways, in command of an engine and a brake-van chalked for repair."
9757,MRS. BATHURST,
9758,MRS. BATHURST,"“If you get something to eat,” he said, “I’ll run you down to"
9759,MRS. BATHURST,Glengariff siding till the goods comes along. It’s cooler there than
9760,MRS. BATHURST,"here, you see.”"
9761,MRS. BATHURST,
9762,MRS. BATHURST,"I got food and drink from the Greeks who sell all things at a price,"
9763,MRS. BATHURST,and the engine trotted us a couple of miles up the line to a bay of
9764,MRS. BATHURST,drifted sand and a plank-platform half buried in sand not a hundred
9765,MRS. BATHURST,"yards from the edge of the surf. Moulded dunes, whiter than any snow,"
9766,MRS. BATHURST,rolled far inland up a brown and purple valley of splintered rocks and
9767,MRS. BATHURST,dry scrub. A crowd of Malays hauled at a net beside two blue and green
9768,MRS. BATHURST,boats on the beach; a picnic party danced and shouted barefoot where a
9769,MRS. BATHURST,"tiny river trickled across the flat, and a circle of dry hills, whose"
9770,MRS. BATHURST,"feet were set in sands of silver, locked us in against a seven-coloured"
9771,MRS. BATHURST,"sea. At either horn of the bay the railway line, cut just above high"
9772,MRS. BATHURST,"water-mark, ran round a shoulder of piled rocks, and disappeared."
9773,MRS. BATHURST,
9774,MRS. BATHURST,"“You see there’s always a breeze here,” said Hooper, opening the door"
9775,MRS. BATHURST,"as the engine left us in the siding on the sand, and the strong"
9776,MRS. BATHURST,south-easter buffeting under Elsie’s Peak dusted sand into our tickey
9777,MRS. BATHURST,beer. Presently he sat down to a file full of spiked documents. He had
9778,MRS. BATHURST,"returned from a long trip up-country, where he had been reporting on"
9779,MRS. BATHURST,"damaged rolling-stock, as far away as Rhodesia. The weight of the bland"
9780,MRS. BATHURST,"wind on my eyelids; the song of it under the car roof, and high up"
9781,MRS. BATHURST,among the rocks; the drift of fine grains chasing each other musically
9782,MRS. BATHURST,ashore; the tramp of the surf; the voices of the picnickers; the rustle
9783,MRS. BATHURST,"of Hooper’s file, and the presence of the assured sun, joined with the"
9784,MRS. BATHURST,beer to cast me into magical slumber. The hills of False Bay were just
9785,MRS. BATHURST,dissolving into those of fairyland when I heard footsteps on the sand
9786,MRS. BATHURST,"outside, and the clink of our couplings."
9787,MRS. BATHURST,
9788,MRS. BATHURST,"“Stop that!” snapped Hooper, without raising his head from his work."
9789,MRS. BATHURST,"“It’s those dirty little Malay boys, you see: they’re always playing"
9790,MRS. BATHURST,with the trucks….”
9791,MRS. BATHURST,
9792,MRS. BATHURST,"“Don’t be hard on ’em. The railway’s a general refuge in Africa,” I"
9793,MRS. BATHURST,replied.
9794,MRS. BATHURST,
9795,MRS. BATHURST,"“’Tis—up-country at any rate. That reminds me,” he felt in his"
9796,MRS. BATHURST,"waistcoat-pocket, “I’ve got a curiosity for you from Wankies—beyond"
9797,MRS. BATHURST,Buluwayo. It’s more of a souvenir perhaps than——”
9798,MRS. BATHURST,
9799,MRS. BATHURST,"“The old hotel’s inhabited,” cried a voice. “White men from the"
9800,MRS. BATHURST,"language. Marines to the front! Come on, Pritch. Here’s your Belmont."
9801,MRS. BATHURST,Wha—i—i!”
9802,MRS. BATHURST,
9803,MRS. BATHURST,The last word dragged like a rope as Mr. Pyecroft ran round to the open
9804,MRS. BATHURST,"door, and stood looking up into my face. Behind him an enormous"
9805,MRS. BATHURST,"Sergeant of Marines trailed a stalk of dried seaweed, and dusted the"
9806,MRS. BATHURST,sand nervously from his fingers.
9807,MRS. BATHURST,
9808,MRS. BATHURST,“What are you doing here?” I asked. “I thought the _Hierophant_ was
9809,MRS. BATHURST,down the coast?”
9810,MRS. BATHURST,
9811,MRS. BATHURST,"“We came in last Tuesday—from Tristan D’Acunha—for overhaul, and we"
9812,MRS. BATHURST,"shall be in dockyard ’ands for two months, with boiler-seatings.”"
9813,MRS. BATHURST,
9814,MRS. BATHURST,"“Come and sit down,” Hooper put away the file."
9815,MRS. BATHURST,
9816,MRS. BATHURST,"“This is Mr. Hooper of the Railway,” I exclaimed, as Pyecroft turned to"
9817,MRS. BATHURST,haul up the black-moustached sergeant.
9818,MRS. BATHURST,
9819,MRS. BATHURST,"“This is Sergeant Pritchard, of the _Agaric_, an old shipmate,” said"
9820,MRS. BATHURST,he. “We were strollin’ on the beach.” The monster blushed and nodded.
9821,MRS. BATHURST,He filled up one side of the van when he sat down.
9822,MRS. BATHURST,
9823,MRS. BATHURST,"“And this is my friend, Mr. Pyecroft,” I added to Hooper, already busy"
9824,MRS. BATHURST,with the extra beer which my prophetic soul had bought from the Greeks.
9825,MRS. BATHURST,
9826,MRS. BATHURST,"“_Moi aussi_” quoth Pyecroft, and drew out beneath his coat a labelled"
9827,MRS. BATHURST,quart bottle.
9828,MRS. BATHURST,
9829,MRS. BATHURST,"“Why, it’s Bass,” cried Hooper."
9830,MRS. BATHURST,
9831,MRS. BATHURST,"“It was Pritchard,” said Pyecroft. “They can’t resist him.”"
9832,MRS. BATHURST,
9833,MRS. BATHURST,"“That’s not so,” said Pritchard, mildly."
9834,MRS. BATHURST,
9835,MRS. BATHURST,"“Not _verbatim_ per’aps, but the look in the eye came to the same"
9836,MRS. BATHURST,thing.”
9837,MRS. BATHURST,
9838,MRS. BATHURST,“Where was it?” I demanded.
9839,MRS. BATHURST,
9840,MRS. BATHURST,“Just on beyond here—at Kalk Bay. She was slappin’ a rug in a back
9841,MRS. BATHURST,"verandah. Pritch hadn’t more than brought his batteries to bear, before"
9842,MRS. BATHURST,she stepped indoors an’ sent it flyin’ over the wall.”
9843,MRS. BATHURST,
9844,MRS. BATHURST,Pyecroft patted the warm bottle.
9845,MRS. BATHURST,
9846,MRS. BATHURST,"“It was all a mistake,” said Pritchard. “I shouldn’t wonder if she"
9847,MRS. BATHURST,mistook me for Maclean. We’re about of a size.”
9848,MRS. BATHURST,
9849,MRS. BATHURST,"I had heard householders of Muizenburg, St. James’s, and Kalk Bay"
9850,MRS. BATHURST,complain of the difficulty of keeping beer or good servants at the
9851,MRS. BATHURST,"seaside, and I began to see the reason. None the less, it was excellent"
9852,MRS. BATHURST,"Bass, and I too drank to the health of that large-minded maid."
9853,MRS. BATHURST,
9854,MRS. BATHURST,"“It’s the uniform that fetches ’em, an’ they fetch it,” said Pyecroft."
9855,MRS. BATHURST,"“My simple navy blue is respectable, but not fascinatin’. Now Pritch in"
9856,MRS. BATHURST,"’is Number One rig is always ‘purr Mary, on the terrace’—_ex officio_"
9857,MRS. BATHURST,as you might say.”
9858,MRS. BATHURST,
9859,MRS. BATHURST,"“She took me for Maclean, I tell you,” Pritchard insisted. “Why—why—to"
9860,MRS. BATHURST,listen to him you wouldn’t think that only yesterday——”
9861,MRS. BATHURST,
9862,MRS. BATHURST,"“Pritch,” said Pyecroft, “be warned in time. If we begin tellin’ what"
9863,MRS. BATHURST,we know about each other we’ll be turned out of the pub. Not to mention
9864,MRS. BATHURST,aggravated desertion on several occasions——”
9865,MRS. BATHURST,
9866,MRS. BATHURST,"“Never anything more than absence without leaf—I defy you to prove it,”"
9867,MRS. BATHURST,said the Sergeant hotly. “An’ if it comes to that how about Vancouver
9868,MRS. BATHURST,in ’87?”
9869,MRS. BATHURST,
9870,MRS. BATHURST,“How about it? Who pulled bow in the gig going ashore? Who told Boy
9871,MRS. BATHURST,Niven…?”
9872,MRS. BATHURST,
9873,MRS. BATHURST,“Surely you were court martialled for that?” I said. The story of Boy
9874,MRS. BATHURST,Niven who lured seven or eight able-bodied seamen and marines into the
9875,MRS. BATHURST,woods of British Columbia used to be a legend of the Fleet.
9876,MRS. BATHURST,
9877,MRS. BATHURST,"“Yes, we were court-martialled to rights,” said Pritchard, “but we"
9878,MRS. BATHURST,should have been tried for murder if Boy Niven ’adn’t been unusually
9879,MRS. BATHURST,tough. He told us he had an uncle ’oo’d give us land to farm. ’E said
9880,MRS. BATHURST,"he was born at the back o’ Vancouver Island, and _all_ the time the"
9881,MRS. BATHURST,beggar was a balmy Barnado Orphan!”
9882,MRS. BATHURST,
9883,MRS. BATHURST,"“_But_ we believed him,” said Pyecroft. “I did—you did—Paterson did—an’"
9884,MRS. BATHURST,’oo was the Marine that married the cocoanut-woman afterwards—him with
9885,MRS. BATHURST,the mouth?”
9886,MRS. BATHURST,
9887,MRS. BATHURST,"“Oh, Jones, Spit-Kid Jones. I ’aven’t thought of ’im in years,” said"
9888,MRS. BATHURST,"Pritchard. “Yes, Spit-Kid believed it, an’ George Anstey and Moon. We"
9889,MRS. BATHURST,were very young an’ very curious.”
9890,MRS. BATHURST,
9891,MRS. BATHURST,"“_But_ lovin’ an’ trustful to a degree,” said Pyecroft."
9892,MRS. BATHURST,
9893,MRS. BATHURST,“Remember when ’e told us to walk in single file for fear o’ bears?
9894,MRS. BATHURST,"‘Remember, Pye, when ’e ’opped about in that bog full o’ ferns an’"
9895,MRS. BATHURST,sniffed an’ said ’e could smell the smoke of ’is uncle’s farm? An’
9896,MRS. BATHURST,_all_ the time it was a dirty little out-lyin’ uninhabited island. We
9897,MRS. BATHURST,"walked round it in a day, an’ come back to our boat lyin’ on the beach."
9898,MRS. BATHURST,A whole day Boy Niven kept us walkin’ in circles lookin’ for ’is
9899,MRS. BATHURST,uncle’s farm! He said his uncle was compelled by the law of the land to
9900,MRS. BATHURST,give us a farm!”
9901,MRS. BATHURST,
9902,MRS. BATHURST,"“Don’t get hot, Pritch. We believed,” said Pyecroft."
9903,MRS. BATHURST,
9904,MRS. BATHURST,“He’d been readin’ books. He only did it to get a run ashore an’ have
9905,MRS. BATHURST,himself talked of. A day an’ a night—eight of us—followin’ Boy Niven
9906,MRS. BATHURST,round an uninhabited island in the Vancouver archipelago! Then the
9907,MRS. BATHURST,picket came for us an’ a nice pack o’ idiots we looked!”
9908,MRS. BATHURST,
9909,MRS. BATHURST,“What did you get for it?” Hooper asked.
9910,MRS. BATHURST,
9911,MRS. BATHURST,“Heavy thunder with continuous lightning for two hours. Thereafter
9912,MRS. BATHURST,"sleet-squalls, a confused sea, and cold, unfriendly weather till"
9913,MRS. BATHURST,"conclusion o’ cruise,” said Pyecroft. “It was only what we expected,"
9914,MRS. BATHURST,"but what we felt, an’ I assure you, Mr. Hooper, even a sailor-man has a"
9915,MRS. BATHURST,"heart to break, was bein’ told that we able seamen an’ promisin’"
9916,MRS. BATHURST,"marines ’ad misled Boy Niven. Yes, we poor back-to-the-landers was"
9917,MRS. BATHURST,"supposed to ’ave misled him! He rounded on us, o’ course, an’ got off"
9918,MRS. BATHURST,easy.”
9919,MRS. BATHURST,
9920,MRS. BATHURST,“Excep’ for what we gave him in the steerin’-flat when we came out o’
9921,MRS. BATHURST,"cells. ’Eard anything of ’im lately, Pye?”"
9922,MRS. BATHURST,
9923,MRS. BATHURST,"“Signal Boatswain in the Channel Fleet, I believe—Mr. L.L. Niven is.”"
9924,MRS. BATHURST,
9925,MRS. BATHURST,"“An’ Anstey died o’ fever in Benin,” Pritchard mused. “What come to"
9926,MRS. BATHURST,Moon? Spit-Kid we know about.”
9927,MRS. BATHURST,
9928,MRS. BATHURST,"“Moon—Moon! Now where did I last…? Oh yes, when I was in the"
9929,MRS. BATHURST,_Palladium_! I met Quigley at Buncrana Station. He told me Moon ’ad run
9930,MRS. BATHURST,when the _Astrild_ sloop was cruising among the South Seas three years
9931,MRS. BATHURST,"back. He always showed signs o’ bein’ a Mormonastic beggar. Yes, he"
9932,MRS. BATHURST,slipped off quietly an’ they ’adn’t time to chase ’im round the islands
9933,MRS. BATHURST,even if the navigatin’ officer ’ad been equal to the job.”
9934,MRS. BATHURST,
9935,MRS. BATHURST,“Wasn’t he?” said Hooper.
9936,MRS. BATHURST,
9937,MRS. BATHURST,“Not so. Accordin’ to Quigley the _Astrild_ spent half her commission
9938,MRS. BATHURST,"rompin’ up the beach like a she-turtle, an’ the other half hatching"
9939,MRS. BATHURST,turtles’ eggs on the top o’ numerous reefs. When she was docked at
9940,MRS. BATHURST,Sydney her copper looked like Aunt Maria’s washing on the line—an’ her
9941,MRS. BATHURST,’midship frames was sprung. The commander swore the dockyard ’ad done
9942,MRS. BATHURST,it haulin’ the pore thing on to the slips. They _do_ do strange things
9943,MRS. BATHURST,"at sea, Mr. Hooper.”"
9944,MRS. BATHURST,
9945,MRS. BATHURST,"“Ah! I’m not a tax-payer,” said Hooper, and opened a fresh bottle. The"
9946,MRS. BATHURST,Sergeant seemed to be one who had a difficulty in dropping subjects.
9947,MRS. BATHURST,
9948,MRS. BATHURST,"“How it all comes back, don’t it?” he said. “Why Moon must ’ave ’ad"
9949,MRS. BATHURST,sixteen years’ service before he ran.”
9950,MRS. BATHURST,
9951,MRS. BATHURST,"“It takes ’em at all ages. Look at—you know,” said Pyecroft."
9952,MRS. BATHURST,
9953,MRS. BATHURST,“Who?” I asked.
9954,MRS. BATHURST,
9955,MRS. BATHURST,"“A service man within eighteen months of his pension, is the party"
9956,MRS. BATHURST,"you’re thinkin’ of,” said Pritchard. “A warrant ’oose name begins with"
9957,MRS. BATHURST,"a V., isn’t it?”"
9958,MRS. BATHURST,
9959,MRS. BATHURST,"“But, in a way o’ puttin’ it, we can’t say that he actually did"
9960,MRS. BATHURST,"desert,” Pyecroft suggested."
9961,MRS. BATHURST,
9962,MRS. BATHURST,"“Oh, no,” said Pritchard. “It was only permanent absence up country"
9963,MRS. BATHURST,without leaf. That was all.”
9964,MRS. BATHURST,
9965,MRS. BATHURST,“Up country?” said Hooper. “Did they circulate his description?”
9966,MRS. BATHURST,
9967,MRS. BATHURST,"“What for?” said Pritchard, most impolitely."
9968,MRS. BATHURST,
9969,MRS. BATHURST,“Because deserters are like columns in the war. They don’t move away
9970,MRS. BATHURST,"from the line, you see. I’ve known a chap caught at Salisbury that way"
9971,MRS. BATHURST,"tryin’ to get to Nyassa. They tell me, but o’ course I don’t know, that"
9972,MRS. BATHURST,they don’t ask questions on the Nyassa Lake Flotilla up there. I’ve
9973,MRS. BATHURST,heard of a P. and O. quartermaster in full command of an armed launch
9974,MRS. BATHURST,there.”
9975,MRS. BATHURST,
9976,MRS. BATHURST,“Do you think Click ’ud ha’ gone up that way?” Pritchard asked.
9977,MRS. BATHURST,
9978,MRS. BATHURST,“There’s no saying. He was sent up to Bloemfontein to take over some
9979,MRS. BATHURST,Navy ammunition left in the fort. We know he took it over and saw it
9980,MRS. BATHURST,into the trucks. Then there was no more Click—then or thereafter. Four
9981,MRS. BATHURST,"months ago it transpired, and thus the _casus belli_ stands at"
9982,MRS. BATHURST,"present,” said Pyecroft."
9983,MRS. BATHURST,
9984,MRS. BATHURST,“What were his marks?” said Hooper again.
9985,MRS. BATHURST,
9986,MRS. BATHURST,"“Does the Railway get a reward for returnin’ ’em, then?” said"
9987,MRS. BATHURST,Pritchard.
9988,MRS. BATHURST,
9989,MRS. BATHURST,“If I did d’you suppose I’d talk about it?” Hooper retorted angrily.
9990,MRS. BATHURST,
9991,MRS. BATHURST,"“You seemed so very interested,” said Pritchard with equal crispness."
9992,MRS. BATHURST,
9993,MRS. BATHURST,“Why was he called Click?” I asked to tide over an uneasy little break
9994,MRS. BATHURST,in the conversation. The two men were staring at each other very
9995,MRS. BATHURST,fixedly.
9996,MRS. BATHURST,
9997,MRS. BATHURST,"“Because of an ammunition hoist carryin’ away,” said Pyecroft. “And it"
9998,MRS. BATHURST,"carried away four of ’is teeth—on the lower port side, wasn’t it,"
9999,MRS. BATHURST,Pritch? The substitutes which he bought weren’t screwed home in a
10000,MRS. BATHURST,manner o’ sayin’. When he talked fast they used to lift a little on the
10001,MRS. BATHURST,"bed plate. ’Ence, ‘Click.’ They called ’im a superior man which is what"
10002,MRS. BATHURST,"we’d call a long, black-’aired, genteely speakin’, ’alf-bred beggar on"
10003,MRS. BATHURST,the lower deck.”
10004,MRS. BATHURST,
10005,MRS. BATHURST,"“Four false teeth on the lower left jaw,” said Hooper, his hand in his"
10006,MRS. BATHURST,waistcoat pocket. “What tattoo marks?”
10007,MRS. BATHURST,
10008,MRS. BATHURST,"“Look here,” began Pritchard, half rising. “I’m sure we’re very"
10009,MRS. BATHURST,"grateful to you as a gentleman for your ’orspitality, but per’aps we"
10010,MRS. BATHURST,may ’ave made an error in—”
10011,MRS. BATHURST,
10012,MRS. BATHURST,"I looked at Pyecroft for aid, Hooper was crimsoning rapidly."
10013,MRS. BATHURST,
10014,MRS. BATHURST,“If the fat marine now occupying the foc’sle will kindly bring ’is
10015,MRS. BATHURST,"_status quo_ to an anchor yet once more, we may be able to talk like"
10016,MRS. BATHURST,"gentlemen—not to say friends,” said Pyecroft. “He regards you, Mr."
10017,MRS. BATHURST,"Hooper, as a emissary of the Law.”"
10018,MRS. BATHURST,
10019,MRS. BATHURST,"“I only wish to observe that when a gentleman exhibits such a peculiar,"
10020,MRS. BATHURST,"or I should rather say, such a _bloomin’_ curiosity in identification"
10021,MRS. BATHURST,marks as our friend here——”
10022,MRS. BATHURST,
10023,MRS. BATHURST,"“Mr. Pritchard,” I interposed, “I’ll take all the responsibility for"
10024,MRS. BATHURST,Mr. Hooper.”
10025,MRS. BATHURST,
10026,MRS. BATHURST,"“An’ _you_’ll apologise all round,” said Pyecroft. “You’re a rude"
10027,MRS. BATHURST,"little man, Pritch.”"
10028,MRS. BATHURST,
10029,MRS. BATHURST,"“But how was I——” he began, wavering."
10030,MRS. BATHURST,
10031,MRS. BATHURST,“I don’t know an’ I don’t care. Apologise!”
10032,MRS. BATHURST,
10033,MRS. BATHURST,The giant looked round bewildered and took our little hands into his
10034,MRS. BATHURST,"vast grip, one by one. “I was wrong,” he said meekly as a sheep. “My"
10035,MRS. BATHURST,"suspicions was unfounded. Mr. Hooper, I apologise.”"
10036,MRS. BATHURST,
10037,MRS. BATHURST,"“You did quite right to look out for your own end o’ the line,” said"
10038,MRS. BATHURST,"Hooper. “I’d ha’ done the same with a gentleman I didn’t know, you see."
10039,MRS. BATHURST,If you don’t mind I’d like to hear a little more o’ your Mr. Vickery.
10040,MRS. BATHURST,"It’s safe with me, you see.”"
10041,MRS. BATHURST,
10042,MRS. BATHURST,"“Why did Vickery run,” I began, but Pyecroft’s smile made me turn my"
10043,MRS. BATHURST,question to “Who was she?”
10044,MRS. BATHURST,
10045,MRS. BATHURST,"“She kep’ a little hotel at Hauraki—near Auckland,” said Pyecroft."
10046,MRS. BATHURST,
10047,MRS. BATHURST,"“By Gawd!” roared Pritchard, slapping his hand on his leg. “Not Mrs."
10048,MRS. BATHURST,Bathurst!”
10049,MRS. BATHURST,
10050,MRS. BATHURST,"Pyecroft nodded slowly, and the Sergeant called all the powers of"
10051,MRS. BATHURST,darkness to witness his bewilderment.
10052,MRS. BATHURST,
10053,MRS. BATHURST,“So far as I could get at it Mrs. B. was the lady in question.”
10054,MRS. BATHURST,
10055,MRS. BATHURST,"“But Click was married,” cried Pritchard."
10056,MRS. BATHURST,
10057,MRS. BATHURST,“An’ ’ad a fifteen year old daughter. ’E’s shown me her photograph.
10058,MRS. BATHURST,"Settin’ that aside, so to say, ’ave you ever found these little things"
10059,MRS. BATHURST,make much difference? Because I haven’t.”
10060,MRS. BATHURST,
10061,MRS. BATHURST,“Good Lord Alive an’ Watchin’!… Mrs. Bathurst….” Then with another
10062,MRS. BATHURST,"roar: “You can say what you please, Pye, but you don’t make me believe"
10063,MRS. BATHURST,it was any of ’er fault. She wasn’t _that!_”
10064,MRS. BATHURST,
10065,MRS. BATHURST,"“If I was going to say what I please, I’d begin by callin’ you a silly"
10066,MRS. BATHURST,ox an’ work up to the higher pressures at leisure. I’m trying to say
10067,MRS. BATHURST,"solely what transpired. M’rover, for once you’re right. It wasn’t her"
10068,MRS. BATHURST,fault.”
10069,MRS. BATHURST,
10070,MRS. BATHURST,"“You couldn’t ’aven’t made me believe it if it ’ad been,” was the"
10071,MRS. BATHURST,answer.
10072,MRS. BATHURST,
10073,MRS. BATHURST,Such faith in a Sergeant of Marines interested me greatly. “Never mind
10074,MRS. BATHURST,"about that,” I cried. “Tell me what she was like.”"
10075,MRS. BATHURST,
10076,MRS. BATHURST,"“She was a widow,” said Pyecroft. “Left so very young and never"
10077,MRS. BATHURST,re-spliced. She kep’ a little hotel for warrants and non-coms close to
10078,MRS. BATHURST,"Auckland, an’ she always wore black silk, and ’er neck—”"
10079,MRS. BATHURST,
10080,MRS. BATHURST,"“You ask what she was like,” Pritchard broke in. “Let me give you an"
10081,MRS. BATHURST,"instance. I was at Auckland first in ’97, at the end o’ the"
10082,MRS. BATHURST,"_Marroquin’s_ commission, an’ as I’d been promoted I went up with the"
10083,MRS. BATHURST,"others. She used to look after us all, an’ she never lost by it—not a"
10084,MRS. BATHURST,"penny! ‘Pay me now,’ she’d say, ‘or settle later. I know you won’t let"
10085,MRS. BATHURST,"me suffer. Send the money from home if you like,’ Why, gentlemen all, I"
10086,MRS. BATHURST,tell you I’ve seen that lady take her own gold watch an’ chain off her
10087,MRS. BATHURST,neck in the bar an’ pass it to a bosun ’oo’d come ashore without ’is
10088,MRS. BATHURST,"ticker an’ ’ad to catch the last boat. ‘I don’t know your name,’ she"
10089,MRS. BATHURST,"said, ‘but when you’ve done with it, you’ll find plenty that know me on"
10090,MRS. BATHURST,the front. Send it back by one o’ them.’ And it was worth thirty pounds
10091,MRS. BATHURST,"if it was worth ’arf a crown. The little gold watch, Pye, with the blue"
10092,MRS. BATHURST,"monogram at the back. But, as I was sayin’, in those days she kep’ a"
10093,MRS. BATHURST,beer that agreed with me—Slits it was called. One way an’ another I
10094,MRS. BATHURST,must ’ave punished a good few bottles of it while we was in the
10095,MRS. BATHURST,"bay—comin’ ashore every night or so. Chaffin across the bar like, once"
10096,MRS. BATHURST,"when we were alone, ‘Mrs. B.,’ I said, ‘when next I call I want you to"
10097,MRS. BATHURST,remember that this is my particular—just as you’re my particular?’
10098,MRS. BATHURST,"(She’d let you go _that_ far!) ‘Just as you’re my particular,’ I said."
10099,MRS. BATHURST,"‘Oh, thank you, Sergeant Pritchard,’ she says, an’ put ’er hand up to"
10100,MRS. BATHURST,"the curl be’ind ’er ear. Remember that way she had, Pye?”"
10101,MRS. BATHURST,
10102,MRS. BATHURST,"“I think so,” said the sailor."
10103,MRS. BATHURST,
10104,MRS. BATHURST,"“Yes, ‘Thank you, Sergeant Pritchard,’ she says. ‘The least I can do is"
10105,MRS. BATHURST,to mark it for you in case you change your mind. There’s no great
10106,MRS. BATHURST,"demand for it in the Fleet,’ she says, ‘but to make sure I’ll put it at"
10107,MRS. BATHURST,"the back o’ the shelf,’ an’ she snipped off a piece of her hair ribbon"
10108,MRS. BATHURST,"with that old dolphin cigar cutter on the bar—remember it, Pye?—an’ she"
10109,MRS. BATHURST,"tied a bow round what was left—just four bottles. That was ’97—no, ’96."
10110,MRS. BATHURST,In ’98 I was in the _Resiliant_—China station—full commission. In
10111,MRS. BATHURST,"Nineteen One, mark you, I was in the _Carthusian_, back in Auckland Bay"
10112,MRS. BATHURST,again. Of course I went up to Mrs. B.’s with the rest of us to see how
10113,MRS. BATHURST,things were goin’. They were the same as ever. (Remember the big tree
10114,MRS. BATHURST,"on the pavement by the side-bar, Pye?) I never said anythin’ in special"
10115,MRS. BATHURST,"(there was too many of us talkin’ to her), but she saw me at once.”"
10116,MRS. BATHURST,
10117,MRS. BATHURST,“That wasn’t difficult?” I ventured.
10118,MRS. BATHURST,
10119,MRS. BATHURST,"“Ah, but wait. I was comin’ up to the bar, when, ‘Ada,’ she says to her"
10120,MRS. BATHURST,"niece, ‘get me Sergeant Pritchard’s particular,’ and, gentlemen all, I"
10121,MRS. BATHURST,"tell you before I could shake ’ands with the lady, there were those"
10122,MRS. BATHURST,"four bottles o’ Slits, with ’er ’air ribbon in a bow round each o’"
10123,MRS. BATHURST,"their necks, set down in front o’ me, an’ as she drew the cork she"
10124,MRS. BATHURST,looked at me under her eyebrows in that blindish way she had o’
10125,MRS. BATHURST,"lookin’, an’, ‘Sergeant Pritchard,’ she says, ‘I do ’ope you ’aven’t"
10126,MRS. BATHURST,changed your mind about your particulars.’ That’s the kind o’ woman she
10127,MRS. BATHURST,was—after five years!”
10128,MRS. BATHURST,
10129,MRS. BATHURST,"“I don’t _see_ her yet somehow,” said Hooper, but with sympathy."
10130,MRS. BATHURST,
10131,MRS. BATHURST,“She—she never scrupled to feed a lame duck or set ’er foot on a
10132,MRS. BATHURST,"scorpion at any time of ’er life,” Pritchard added valiantly."
10133,MRS. BATHURST,
10134,MRS. BATHURST,“That don’t help me either. My mother’s like that for one.”
10135,MRS. BATHURST,
10136,MRS. BATHURST,The giant heaved inside his uniform and rolled his eyes at the
10137,MRS. BATHURST,car-roof. Said Pyecroft suddenly:—
10138,MRS. BATHURST,
10139,MRS. BATHURST,"“How many women have you been intimate with all over the world,"
10140,MRS. BATHURST,Pritch?”
10141,MRS. BATHURST,
10142,MRS. BATHURST,Pritchard blushed plum colour to the short hairs of his seventeen-inch
10143,MRS. BATHURST,neck.
10144,MRS. BATHURST,
10145,MRS. BATHURST,"“’Undreds,” said Pyecroft. “So’ve I. How many of ’em can you remember"
10146,MRS. BATHURST,"in your own mind, settin’ aside the first—an’ per’aps the last—_and one"
10147,MRS. BATHURST,more_?”
10148,MRS. BATHURST,
10149,MRS. BATHURST,"“Few, wonderful few, now I tax myself,” said Sergeant Pritchard,"
10150,MRS. BATHURST,relievedly.
10151,MRS. BATHURST,
10152,MRS. BATHURST,“An’ how many times might you ’ave been at Aukland?”
10153,MRS. BATHURST,
10154,MRS. BATHURST,"“One—two,” he began. “Why, I can’t make it more than three times in ten"
10155,MRS. BATHURST,years. But I can remember every time that I ever saw Mrs. B.”
10156,MRS. BATHURST,
10157,MRS. BATHURST,“So can I—an’ I’ve only been to Auckland twice—how she stood an’ what
10158,MRS. BATHURST,she was sayin’ an’ what she looked like. That’s the secret. ’Tisn’t
10159,MRS. BATHURST,"beauty, so to speak, nor good talk necessarily. It’s just It. Some"
10160,MRS. BATHURST,"women’ll stay in a man’s memory if they once walked down a street, but"
10161,MRS. BATHURST,"most of ’em you can live with a month on end, an’ next commission you’d"
10162,MRS. BATHURST,"be put to it to certify whether they talked in their sleep or not, as"
10163,MRS. BATHURST,one might say.”
10164,MRS. BATHURST,
10165,MRS. BATHURST,"“Ah,” said Hooper. “That’s more the idea. I’ve known just two women of"
10166,MRS. BATHURST,that nature.”
10167,MRS. BATHURST,
10168,MRS. BATHURST,“An’ it was no fault o’ theirs?” asked Pritchard.
10169,MRS. BATHURST,
10170,MRS. BATHURST,“None whatever. I know that!”
10171,MRS. BATHURST,
10172,MRS. BATHURST,"“An’ if a man gets struck with that kind o’ woman, Mr. Hooper?”"
10173,MRS. BATHURST,Pritchard went on.
10174,MRS. BATHURST,
10175,MRS. BATHURST,"“He goes crazy—or just saves himself,” was the slow answer."
10176,MRS. BATHURST,
10177,MRS. BATHURST,"“You’ve hit it,” said the Sergeant. “You’ve seen an’ known somethin’ in"
10178,MRS. BATHURST,"the course o’ your life, Mr. Hooper. I’m lookin’ at you!” He set down"
10179,MRS. BATHURST,his bottle.
10180,MRS. BATHURST,
10181,MRS. BATHURST,“And how often had Vickery seen her?” I asked.
10182,MRS. BATHURST,
10183,MRS. BATHURST,"“That’s the dark an’ bloody mystery,” Pyecroft answered. “I’d never"
10184,MRS. BATHURST,"come across him till I come out in the _Hierophant_ just now, an’ there"
10185,MRS. BATHURST,"wasn’t any one in the ship who knew much about him. You see, he was"
10186,MRS. BATHURST,what you call a superior man. ’E spoke to me once or twice about
10187,MRS. BATHURST,Auckland and Mrs. B. on the voyage out. I called that to mind
10188,MRS. BATHURST,"subsequently. There must ’ave been a good deal between ’em, to my way"
10189,MRS. BATHURST,"o’ thinkin’. Mind you I’m only giving you my _sum_ of it all, because"
10190,MRS. BATHURST,"all I know is second-hand so to speak, or rather I should say more than"
10191,MRS. BATHURST,second-’and.”
10192,MRS. BATHURST,
10193,MRS. BATHURST,“How?” said Hooper peremptorily. “You must have seen it or heard it.”
10194,MRS. BATHURST,
10195,MRS. BATHURST,"“Yes,” said Pyecroft. “I used to think seein’ and hearin’ was the only"
10196,MRS. BATHURST,"regulation aids to ascertainin’ facts, but as we get older we get more"
10197,MRS. BATHURST,"accommodatin’. The cylinders work easier, I suppose…. Were you in Cape"
10198,MRS. BATHURST,Town last December when Phyllis’s Circus came?”
10199,MRS. BATHURST,
10200,MRS. BATHURST,"“No—up country,” said Hooper, a little nettled at the change of venue."
10201,MRS. BATHURST,
10202,MRS. BATHURST,“I ask because they had a new turn of a scientific nature called ‘Home
10203,MRS. BATHURST,and Friends for a Tickey.’”
10204,MRS. BATHURST,
10205,MRS. BATHURST,"“Oh, you mean the cinematograph—the pictures of prize-fights and"
10206,MRS. BATHURST,steamers. I’ve seen ’em up country.”
10207,MRS. BATHURST,
10208,MRS. BATHURST,“Biograph or cinematograph was what I was alludin’ to. London Bridge
10209,MRS. BATHURST,with the omnibuses—a troopship goin’ to the war—marines on parade at
10210,MRS. BATHURST,Portsmouth an’ the Plymouth Express arrivin’ at Paddin’ton.”
10211,MRS. BATHURST,
10212,MRS. BATHURST,"“Seen ’em all. Seen ’em all,” said Hooper impatiently."
10213,MRS. BATHURST,
10214,MRS. BATHURST,“We _Hierophants_ came in just before Christmas week an’ leaf was
10215,MRS. BATHURST,easy.”
10216,MRS. BATHURST,
10217,MRS. BATHURST,“I think a man gets fed up with Cape Town quicker than anywhere else on
10218,MRS. BATHURST,"the station. Why, even Durban’s more like Nature. We was there for"
10219,MRS. BATHURST,"Christmas,” Pritchard put in."
10220,MRS. BATHURST,
10221,MRS. BATHURST,"“Not bein’ a devotee of Indian _peeris_, as our Doctor said to the"
10222,MRS. BATHURST,"Pusser, I can’t exactly say. Phyllis’s was good enough after musketry"
10223,MRS. BATHURST,practice at Mozambique. I couldn’t get off the first two or three
10224,MRS. BATHURST,nights on account of what you might call an imbroglio with our Torpedo
10225,MRS. BATHURST,"Lieutenant in the submerged flat, where some pride of the West country"
10226,MRS. BATHURST,had sugared up a gyroscope; but I remember Vickery went ashore with our
10227,MRS. BATHURST,Carpenter Rigdon—old Crocus we called him. As a general rule Crocus
10228,MRS. BATHURST,"never left ’is ship unless an’ until he was ’oisted out with a winch,"
10229,MRS. BATHURST,but _when_ ’e went ’e would return noddin’ like a lily gemmed with dew.
10230,MRS. BATHURST,"We smothered him down below that night, but the things ’e said about"
10231,MRS. BATHURST,Vickery as a fittin’ playmate for a Warrant Officer of ’is cubic
10232,MRS. BATHURST,"capacity, before we got him quiet, was what I should call pointed.”"
10233,MRS. BATHURST,
10234,MRS. BATHURST,"“I’ve been with Crocus—in the _Redoubtable_,” said the Sergeant. “He’s"
10235,MRS. BATHURST,a character if there is one.”
10236,MRS. BATHURST,
10237,MRS. BATHURST,“Next night I went into Cape Town with Dawson and Pratt; but just at
10238,MRS. BATHURST,"the door of the Circus I came across Vickery. ‘Oh!’ he says, ‘you’re"
10239,MRS. BATHURST,the man I’m looking for. Come and sit next me. This way to the shillin’
10240,MRS. BATHURST,"places!’ I went astern at once, protestin’ because tickey seats better"
10241,MRS. BATHURST,"suited my so-called finances. ‘Come on,’ says Vickery, ‘I’m payin’.’"
10242,MRS. BATHURST,Naturally I abandoned Pratt and Dawson in anticipation o’ drinks to
10243,MRS. BATHURST,"match the seats. ‘No,’ he says, when this was ’inted—‘not now. Not now."
10244,MRS. BATHURST,"As many as you please afterwards, but I want you sober for the"
10245,MRS. BATHURST,"occasion.’ I caught ’is face under a lamp just then, an’ the appearance"
10246,MRS. BATHURST,of it quite cured me of my thirsts. Don’t mistake. It didn’t frighten
10247,MRS. BATHURST,"me. It made me anxious. I can’t tell you what it was like, but that was"
10248,MRS. BATHURST,"the effect which it ’ad on me. If you want to know, it reminded me of"
10249,MRS. BATHURST,those things in bottles in those herbalistic shops at
10250,MRS. BATHURST,Plymouth—preserved in spirits of wine. White an’ crumply
10251,MRS. BATHURST,things—previous to birth as you might say.”
10252,MRS. BATHURST,
10253,MRS. BATHURST,"“You ’ave a beastial mind, Pye,” said the Sergeant, relighting his"
10254,MRS. BATHURST,pipe.
10255,MRS. BATHURST,
10256,MRS. BATHURST,"“Perhaps. We were in the front row, an’ ‘Home an’ Friends’ came on"
10257,MRS. BATHURST,early. Vickery touched me on the knee when the number went up. ‘If you
10258,MRS. BATHURST,"see anything that strikes you,’ he says, ‘drop me a hint’; then he went"
10259,MRS. BATHURST,"on clicking. We saw London Bridge an’ so forth an’ so on, an’ it was"
10260,MRS. BATHURST,most interestin’. I’d never seen it before. You ’eard a little dynamo
10261,MRS. BATHURST,"like buzzin’, but the pictures were the real thing—alive an’ movin’.”"
10262,MRS. BATHURST,
10263,MRS. BATHURST,"“I’ve seen ’em,” said Hooper. “Of course they are taken from the very"
10264,MRS. BATHURST,thing itself—you see.”
10265,MRS. BATHURST,
10266,MRS. BATHURST,“Then the Western Mail came in to Paddin’ton on the big magic lantern
10267,MRS. BATHURST,sheet. First we saw the platform empty an’ the porters standin’ by.
10268,MRS. BATHURST,"Then the engine come in, head on, an’ the women in the front row"
10269,MRS. BATHURST,jumped: she headed so straight. Then the doors opened and the
10270,MRS. BATHURST,passengers came out and the porters got the luggage—just like life.
10271,MRS. BATHURST,"Only—only when any one came down too far towards us that was watchin’,"
10272,MRS. BATHURST,"they walked right out o’ the picture, so to speak. I was ’ighly"
10273,MRS. BATHURST,"interested, I can tell you. So were all of us. I watched an old man"
10274,MRS. BATHURST,"with a rug ’oo’d dropped a book an’ was tryin’ to pick it up, when"
10275,MRS. BATHURST,"quite slowly, from be’ind two porters—carryin’ a little reticule an’"
10276,MRS. BATHURST,lookin’ from side to side—comes out Mrs. Bathurst. There was no
10277,MRS. BATHURST,mistakin’ the walk in a hundred thousand. She come forward—right
10278,MRS. BATHURST,forward—she looked out straight at us with that blindish look which
10279,MRS. BATHURST,Pritch alluded to. She walked on and on till she melted out of the
10280,MRS. BATHURST,"picture—like—like a shadow jumpin’ over a candle, an’ as she went I"

10284,B.!’”,Hooper swallowed his spittle and leaned forward intently.
10285,B.!’”,
10286,B.!’”,“Vickery touched me on the knee again. He was clickin’ his four false
10287,B.!’”,teeth with his jaw down like an enteric at the last kick. ‘Are you
10288,B.!’”,"sure?’ says he. ‘Sure,’ I says, ‘didn’t you ’ear Dawson give tongue?"
10289,B.!’”,"Why, it’s the woman herself.’ ‘I was sure before,’ he says, ‘but I"
10290,B.!’”,brought you to make sure. Will you come again with me to-morrow?’
10291,B.!’”,
10292,B.!’”,"“‘Willingly,’ I says, ‘it’s like meetin’ old friends.’"
10293,B.!’”,
10294,B.!’”,"“‘Yes,’ he says, openin’ his watch, ‘very like. It will be"
10295,B.!’”,four-and-twenty hours less four minutes before I see her again. Come
10296,B.!’”,"and have a drink,’ he says. ‘It may amuse you, but it’s no sort of"
10297,B.!’”,earthly use to me.’ He went out shaking his head an’ stumblin’ over
10298,B.!’”,people’s feet as if he was drunk already. I anticipated a swift drink
10299,B.!’”,"an’ a speedy return, because I wanted to see the performin’ elephants."
10300,B.!’”,Instead o’ which Vickery began to navigate the town at the rate o’
10301,B.!’”,"knots, lookin’ in at a bar every three minutes approximate Greenwich"
10302,B.!’”,"time. I’m not a drinkin’ man, though there are those present”—he cocked"
10303,B.!’”,his unforgetable eye at me—“who may have seen me more or less imbued
10304,B.!’”,"with the fragrant spirit. None the less, when I drink I like to do it"
10305,B.!’”,at anchor an’ not at an average speed of eighteen knots on the measured
10306,B.!’”,mile. There’s a tank as you might say at the back o’ that big hotel up
10307,B.!’”,the hill—what do they call it?”
10308,B.!’”,
10309,B.!’”,"“The Molteno Reservoir,” I suggested, and Hooper nodded."
10310,B.!’”,
10311,B.!’”,“That was his limit o’ drift. We walked there an’ we come down through
10312,B.!’”,the Gardens—there was a South-Easter blowin’—an’ we finished up by the
10313,B.!’”,"Docks. Then we bore up the road to Salt River, and wherever there was a"
10314,B.!’”,pub Vickery put in sweatin’. He didn’t look at what he drunk—he didn’t
10315,B.!’”,look at the change. He walked an’ he drunk an’ he perspired in rivers.
10316,B.!’”,"I understood why old Crocus ’ad come back in the condition ’e did,"
10317,B.!’”,because Vickery an’ I ’ad two an’ a half hours o’ this gipsy manœuvre

10322,B.!’”,
10323,B.!’”,“The sum total of ’is conversation from 7.45 P.M. till 11.15 P.M. was
10324,B.!’”,‘Let’s have another.’ Thus the mornin’ an’ the evenin’ were the first
10325,B.!’”,"day, as Scripture says…. To abbreviate a lengthy narrative, I went into"
10326,B.!’”,"Cape Town for five consecutive nights with Master Vickery, and in that"
10327,B.!’”,time I must ’ave logged about fifty knots over the ground an’ taken in
10328,B.!’”,two gallon o’ all the worst spirits south the Equator. The evolution
10329,B.!’”,never varied. Two shilling seats for us two; five minutes o’ the
10330,B.!’”,"pictures, an’ perhaps forty-five seconds o’ Mrs. B. walking down"
10331,B.!’”,towards us with that blindish look in her eyes an’ the reticule in her
10332,B.!’”,hand. Then out walk—and drink till train time.”
10333,B.!’”,
10334,B.!’”,"“What did you think?” said Hooper, his hand fingering his waistcoat"
10335,B.!’”,pocket.
10336,B.!’”,
10337,B.!’”,"“Several things,” said Pyecroft. “To tell you the truth, I aren’t quite"
10338,B.!’”,done thinkin’ about it yet. Mad? The man was a dumb lunatic—must ’ave
10339,B.!’”,"been for months—years p’raps. I know somethin’ o’ maniacs, as every man"
10340,B.!’”,in the Service must. I’ve been shipmates with a mad skipper—an’ a
10341,B.!’”,"lunatic Number One, but never both together I thank ’Eaven. I could"
10342,B.!’”,"give you the names o’ three captains now ’oo ought to be in an asylum,"
10343,B.!’”,but you don’t find me interferin’ with the mentally afflicted till they
10344,B.!’”,begin to lay about ’em with rammers an’ winch-handles. Only once I
10345,B.!’”,crept up a little into the wind towards Master Vickery. ‘I wonder what
10346,B.!’”,"she’s doin’ in England,’ I says. ‘Don’t it seem to you she’s lookin’"
10347,B.!’”,"for somebody?’ That was in the Gardens again, with the South-Easter"
10348,B.!’”,"blowin’ as we were makin’ our desperate round. ‘She’s lookin’ for me,’"
10349,B.!’”,"he says, stoppin’ dead under a lamp an’ clickin’. When he wasn’t"
10350,B.!’”,"drinkin’, in which case all ’is teeth clicked on the glass, ’e was"
10351,B.!’”,clickin’ ’is four false teeth like a Marconi ticker. ‘Yes! lookin’ for
10352,B.!’”,"me,’ he said, an’ he went on very softly an’ as you might say"
10353,B.!’”,"affectionately. ‘_But_, he went on, ‘in future, Mr. Pyecroft, I should"
10354,B.!’”,take it kindly of you if you’d confine your remarks to the drinks set
10355,B.!’”,"before you. Otherwise,’ he says, ‘with the best will in the world"
10356,B.!’”,"towards you, I may find myself guilty of murder! Do you understand?’ he"
10357,B.!’”,"says. ‘Perfectly,’ I says, ‘but would it at all soothe you to know that"
10358,B.!’”,in such a case the chances o’ your being killed are precisely
10359,B.!’”,"equivalent to the chances o’ me being outed.’ ‘Why, no,’ he says, ‘I’m"
10360,B.!’”,"almost afraid that ’ud be a temptation,’"
10361,B.!’”,
10362,B.!’”,“Then I said—we was right under the lamp by that arch at the end o’ the
10363,B.!’”,Gardens where the trams came round—‘Assumin’ murder was done—or
10364,B.!’”,attempted murder—I put it to you that you would still be left so badly
10365,B.!’”,"crippled, as one might say, that your subsequent capture by the"
10366,B.!’”,police—to ’oom you would ’ave to explain—would be largely inevitable.’
10367,B.!’”,"‘That’s better,’ ’e says, passin’ ’is hands over his forehead. ‘That’s"
10368,B.!’”,"much better, because,’ he says, ‘do you know, as I am now, Pye, I’m not"
10369,B.!’”,so sure if I could explain anything much.’ Those were the only
10370,B.!’”,particular words I had with ’im in our walks as I remember.”
10371,B.!’”,
10372,B.!’”,"“What walks!” said Hooper. “Oh my soul, what walks!”"
10373,B.!’”,
10374,B.!’”,"“They were chronic,” said Pyecroft gravely, “but I didn’t anticipate"
10375,B.!’”,"any danger till the Circus left. Then I anticipated that, bein’"
10376,B.!’”,"deprived of ’is stimulant, he might react on me, so to say, with a"
10377,B.!’”,"hatchet. Consequently, after the final performance an’ the ensuin’ wet"
10378,B.!’”,"walk, I kep’ myself aloof from my superior officer on board in the"
10379,B.!’”,"execution of ’is duty as you might put it. Consequently, I was"
10380,B.!’”,interested when the sentry informs me while I was passin’ on my lawful
10381,B.!’”,occasions that Click had asked to see the captain. As a general rule
10382,B.!’”,"warrant officers don’t dissipate much of the owner’s time, but Click"
10383,B.!’”,put in an hour and more be’ind that door. My duties kep’ me within
10384,B.!’”,"eyeshot of it. Vickery came out first, an’ ’e actually nodded at me an’"
10385,B.!’”,"smiled. This knocked me out o’ the boat, because, havin’ seen ’is face"
10386,B.!’”,"for five consecutive nights, I didn’t anticipate any change there more"
10387,B.!’”,"than a condenser in hell, so to speak. The owner emerged later. His"
10388,B.!’”,"face didn’t read off at all, so I fell back on his cox, ’oo’d been"
10389,B.!’”,eight years with him and knew him better than boat signals. Lamson—that
10390,B.!’”,was the cox’s name—crossed ’is bows once or twice at low speeds an’
10391,B.!’”,dropped down to me visibly concerned. ‘He’s shipped ’is court-martial
10392,B.!’”,"face,’ says Lamson. ‘Some one’s goin’ to be ’ung. I’ve never seen that"
10393,B.!’”,look but once before when they chucked the gun-sights overboard in the
10394,B.!’”,"_Fantastic_.’ Throwin’ gun-sights overboard, Mr. Hooper, is the"
10395,B.!’”,equivalent for mutiny in these degenerate days. It’s done to attract
10396,B.!’”,the notice of the authorities an’ the _Western Mornin’ News_—generally
10397,B.!’”,"by a stoker. Naturally, word went round the lower deck an’ we had a"
10398,B.!’”,"private over’aul of our little consciences. But, barrin’ a shirt which"
10399,B.!’”,a second-class stoker said ’ad walked into ’is bag from the marines
10400,B.!’”,"flat by itself, nothin’ vital transpired. The owner went about flyin’"
10401,B.!’”,"the signal for ‘attend public execution,’ so to say, but there was no"
10402,B.!’”,corpse at the yardarm. ’E lunched on the beach an’ ’e returned with ’is
10403,B.!’”,regulation harbour-routine face about 3 P.M. Thus Lamson lost prestige
10404,B.!’”,for raising false alarms. The only person ’oo might ’ave connected the
10405,B.!’”,"epicycloidal gears correctly was one Pyecroft, when he was told that"
10406,B.!’”,Mr. Vickery would go up country that same evening to take over certain
10407,B.!’”,naval ammunition left after the war in Bloemfontein Fort. No details
10408,B.!’”,was ordered to accompany Master Vickery. He was told off first person
10409,B.!’”,singular—as a unit—-by himself.”
10410,B.!’”,
10411,B.!’”,The marine whistled penetratingly.
10412,B.!’”,
10413,B.!’”,"“That’s what I thought,” said Pyecroft. “I went ashore with him in the"
10414,B.!’”,cutter an’ ’e asked me to walk through the station. He was clickin’
10415,B.!’”,"audibly, but otherwise seemed happy-ish."
10416,B.!’”,
10417,B.!’”,"“‘You might like to know,’ he says, stoppin’ just opposite the"
10418,B.!’”,"Admiral’s front gate, ‘that Phyllis’s Circus will be performin’ at"
10419,B.!’”,Worcester to-morrow night. So I shall see ’er yet once again. You’ve

10421,B.!’”,
10422,B.!’”,"“‘Look here, Vickery,’ I said, ‘this thing’s come to be just as much as"

10425,B.!’”,“‘You!’ he said. ‘What have you got to complain of?—you’ve only ’ad to

10428,B.!’”,"says—we were just by the Admiral’s garden-gate then—‘remember, that I"
10429,B.!’”,"am _not_ a murderer, because my lawful wife died in childbed six weeks"
10430,B.!’”,"after I came out. That much at least I am clear of,’ ’e says."
10431,B.!’”,
10432,B.!’”,“‘Then what have you done that signifies?’ I said. ‘What’s the rest of
10433,B.!’”,it?’
10434,B.!’”,
10435,B.!’”,"“‘The rest,’ ’e says, ‘is silence,’ an’ he shook ’ands and went"

10438,B.!’”,“Did he stop to see Mrs. Bathurst at Worcester?” I asked.
10439,B.!’”,
10440,B.!’”,"“It’s not known. He reported at Bloemfontein, saw the ammunition into"

10443,B.!’”,about ’is wife was true he was a free man as ’e then stood. How do you

10482,B.!’”,"there, you see. It runs through solid teak forest—a sort o’ mahogany"
10483,B.!’”,really—seventy-two miles without a curve. I’ve had a train derailed
10484,B.!’”,there twenty-three times in forty miles. I was up there a month ago
10485,B.!’”,"relievin’ a sick inspector, you see. He told me to look out for a"

10491,B.!’”,I’d find ’em at M’Bindwe siding waiting to go North. He’d given ’em
10492,B.!’”,"some grub and quinine, you see. I went up on a construction train. I"
10493,B.!’”,"looked out for ’em. I saw them miles ahead along the straight, waiting"
10494,B.!’”,in the teak. One of ’em was standin’ up by the dead-end of the siding
10495,B.!’”,"an’ the other was squattin’ down lookin’ up at ’im, you see.”"

10502,B.!’”,fell to bits when we tried to shift ’em. The man who was standin’ up
10503,B.!’”,had the false teeth. I saw ’em shinin’ against the black. Fell to bits
10504,B.!’”,"he did too, like his mate squatting down an’ watchin’ him, both of ’em"
10505,B.!’”,"all wet in the rain. Both burned to charcoal, you see. And—that’s what"

10589,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Book—Book—Domesday Book!” They were letting in the water for the
10590,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"evening stint at Robert’s Mill, and the wooden Wheel where lived the"
10591,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Spirit of the Mill settled to its nine hundred year old song: “Here
10592,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Azor, a freeman, held one rod, but it never paid geld. _Nun-nun-nunquam"
10593,BELOW THE MILL DAM,geldavit_. Here Reinbert has one villein and four cottars with one
10594,BELOW THE MILL DAM,plough—and wood for six hogs and two fisheries of sixpence and a mill
10595,BELOW THE MILL DAM,of ten shillings—_unum molinum_—one mill. Reinbert’s mill—Robert’s
10596,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Mill. Then and afterwards and now—_tunc et post et modo_—Robert’s Mill.
10597,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Book—Book—Domesday Book!”
10598,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10599,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“I confess,” said the Black Rat on the crossbeam, luxuriously trimming"
10600,BELOW THE MILL DAM,his whiskers—“I confess I am not above appreciating my position and all
10601,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"it means.” He was a genuine old English black rat, a breed which,"
10602,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"report says, is rapidly diminishing before the incursions of the brown"
10603,BELOW THE MILL DAM,variety.
10604,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10605,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Appreciation is the surest sign of inadequacy,” said the Grey Cat,"
10606,BELOW THE MILL DAM,coiled up on a piece of sacking.
10607,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10608,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“But I know what you mean,” she added. “To sit by right at the heart of"
10609,BELOW THE MILL DAM,things—eh?”
10610,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10611,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Yes,” said the Black Rat, as the old mill shook and the heavy stones"
10612,BELOW THE MILL DAM,thuttered on the grist. “To possess—er—all this environment as an
10613,BELOW THE MILL DAM,integral part of one’s daily life must insensibly of course … You see?”
10614,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10615,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“I feel,” said the Grey Cat. “Indeed, if _we_ are not saturated with"
10616,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"the spirit of the Mill, who should be?”"
10617,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10618,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Book—Book—Domesday Book!” the Wheel, set to his work, was running off"
10619,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"the tenure of the whole rape, for he knew Domesday Book backwards and"
10620,BELOW THE MILL DAM,forwards: “_In Ferle tenuit Abbatia de Wiltuna unam hidam et unam
10621,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"virgam et dimidiam. Nunquam geldavit_. And Agemond, a freeman, has half"
10622,BELOW THE MILL DAM,a hide and one rod. I remember Agemond well. Charmin’ fellow—friend of
10623,BELOW THE MILL DAM,mine. He married a Norman girl in the days when we rather looked down
10624,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"on the Normans as upstarts. An’ Agemond’s dead? So he is. Eh, dearie"
10625,BELOW THE MILL DAM,me! dearie me! I remember the wolves howling outside his door in the
10626,BELOW THE MILL DAM,big frost of Ten Fifty-Nine…. _Essewelde hundredum nunquam geldum
10627,BELOW THE MILL DAM,reddidit_. Book! Book! Domesday Book!”
10628,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10629,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“After all,” the Grey Cat continued, “atmospere is life. It is the"
10630,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"influences under which we live that count in the long run. Now,"
10631,BELOW THE MILL DAM,outside”—she cocked one ear towards the half-opened door—“there is an
10632,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"absurd convention that rats and cats are, I won’t go so far as to say"
10633,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"natural enemies, but opposed forces. Some such ruling may be crudely"
10634,BELOW THE MILL DAM,effective—I don’t for a minute presume to set up my standards as
10635,BELOW THE MILL DAM,final—among the ditches; but from the larger point of view that one
10636,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"gains by living at the heart of things, it seems for a rule of life a"
10637,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"little overstrained. Why, because some of your associates have, shall I"
10638,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"say, liberal views on the ultimate destination of a sack"
10639,BELOW THE MILL DAM,of—er—middlings don’t they call them——”
10640,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10641,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Something of that sort,” said the Black Rat, a most sharp and"
10642,BELOW THE MILL DAM,sweet-toothed judge of everything ground in the mill for the last three
10643,BELOW THE MILL DAM,years.
10644,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10645,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Thanks—middlings be it. _Why_, as I was saying, must I disarrange my"
10646,BELOW THE MILL DAM,fur and my digestion to chase you round the dusty arena whenever we
10647,BELOW THE MILL DAM,happen to meet?”
10648,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10649,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“As little reason,” said the Black Rat, “as there is for me, who, I"
10650,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"trust, am a person of ordinarily decent instincts, to wait till you"
10651,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"have gone on a round of calls, and then to assassinate your very"
10652,BELOW THE MILL DAM,charming children.”
10653,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10654,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Exactly! It has its humorous side though.” The Grey Cat yawned. “The
10655,BELOW THE MILL DAM,miller seems afflicted by it. He shouted large and vague threats to my
10656,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"address, last night at tea, that he wasn’t going to keep cats who"
10657,BELOW THE MILL DAM,‘caught no mice.’ Those were his words. I remember the grammar sticking
10658,BELOW THE MILL DAM,in my throat like a herring-bone.”
10659,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10660,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“And what did you do?”
10661,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10662,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“What does one do when a barbarian utters? One ceases to utter and
10663,BELOW THE MILL DAM,removes. I removed—towards his pantry. It was a _riposte_ he might
10664,BELOW THE MILL DAM,appreciate.”
10665,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10666,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Really those people grow absolutely insufferable,” said the Black Rat."
10667,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“There is a local ruffian who answers to the name of Mangles—a
10668,BELOW THE MILL DAM,builder—who has taken possession of the outhouses on the far side of
10669,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the Wheel for the last fortnight. He has constructed cubical horrors in
10670,BELOW THE MILL DAM,red brick where those deliciously picturesque pigstyes used to stand.
10671,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Have you noticed?”
10672,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10673,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“There has been much misdirected activity of late among the humans.
10674,BELOW THE MILL DAM,They jabber inordinately. I haven’t yet been able to arrive at their
10675,BELOW THE MILL DAM,reason for existence.” The Cat yawned.
10676,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10677,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“A couple of them came in here last week with wires, and fixed them all"
10678,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"about the walls. Wires protected by some abominable composition, ending"
10679,BELOW THE MILL DAM,in iron brackets with glass bulbs. Utterly useless for any purpose and
10680,BELOW THE MILL DAM,artistically absolutely hideous. What do they mean?”
10681,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10682,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Aaah! I have known _four_-and-twenty leaders of revolt in Faenza,”"
10683,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"said the Cat, who kept good company with the boarders spending a summer"
10684,BELOW THE MILL DAM,at the Mill Farm. “It means nothing except that humans occasionally
10685,BELOW THE MILL DAM,bring their dogs with them. I object to dogs in all forms.”
10686,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10687,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Shouldn’t object to dogs,” said the Wheel sleepily…. “The Abbot of"
10688,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Wilton kept the best pack in the county. He enclosed all the Harryngton
10689,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Woods to Sturt Common. Aluric, a freeman, was dispossessed of his"
10690,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"holding. They tried the case at Lewes, but he got no change out of"
10691,BELOW THE MILL DAM,William de Warrenne on the bench. William de Warrenne fined Aluric
10692,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"eight and fourpence for treason, and the Abbot of Wilton excommunicated"
10693,BELOW THE MILL DAM,him for blasphemy. Aluric was no sportsman. Then the Abbot’s brother
10694,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"married … I’ve forgotten her name, but she was a charmin’ little woman."
10695,BELOW THE MILL DAM,The Lady Philippa was her daughter. That was after the barony was
10696,BELOW THE MILL DAM,conferred. She rode devilish straight to hounds. They were a bit
10697,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"throatier than we breed now, but a good pack: one of the best. The"
10698,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Abbot kept ’em in splendid shape. Now, who was the woman the Abbot"
10699,BELOW THE MILL DAM,kept? Book—Book! I shall have to go right back to Domesday and work up
10700,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the centuries: _Modo per omnia reddit burgum tunc—tunc—tunc_! Was it
10701,BELOW THE MILL DAM,_burgum_ or _hundredum_? I shall remember in a minute. There’s no
10702,BELOW THE MILL DAM,hurry.” He paused as he turned over silvered with showering drops.
10703,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10704,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“This won’t do,” said the Waters in the sluice. “Keep moving.”"
10705,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10706,BELOW THE MILL DAM,The Wheel swung forward; the Waters roared on the buckets and dropped
10707,BELOW THE MILL DAM,down to the darkness below.
10708,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10709,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Noisier than usual,” said the Black Rat. “It must have been raining up"
10710,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the valley.”
10711,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10712,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Floods maybe,” said the Wheel dreamily. “It isn’t the proper season,"
10713,BELOW THE MILL DAM,but they can come without warning. I shall never forget the big
10714,BELOW THE MILL DAM,one—when the Miller went to sleep and forgot to open the hatches. More
10715,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"than two hundred years ago it was, but I recall it distinctly. Most"
10716,BELOW THE MILL DAM,unsettling.”
10717,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10718,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“We lifted that wheel off his bearings,” cried the Waters. “We said,"
10719,BELOW THE MILL DAM,‘Take away that bauble!’ And in the morning he was five mile down the
10720,BELOW THE MILL DAM,valley—hung up in a tree.”
10721,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10722,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Vulgar!” said the Cat. “But I am sure he never lost his dignity.”
10723,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10724,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“We don’t know. He looked like the Ace of Diamonds when we had finished
10725,BELOW THE MILL DAM,with him…. Move on there! Keep on moving. Over! Get over!”
10726,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10727,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“And why on this day more than any other,” said the Wheel statelily. “I"
10728,BELOW THE MILL DAM,am not aware that my department requires the stimulus of external
10729,BELOW THE MILL DAM,pressure to keep it up to its duties. I trust I have the elementary
10730,BELOW THE MILL DAM,instincts of a gentleman.”
10731,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10732,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Maybe,” the Waters answered together, leaping down on the buckets. “We"
10733,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"only know that you are very stiff on your bearings. Over, get over!”"
10734,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10735,BELOW THE MILL DAM,The Wheel creaked and groaned. There was certainly greater pressure
10736,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"upon him than he had ever felt, and his revolutions had increased from"
10737,BELOW THE MILL DAM,six and three-quarters to eight and a third per minute. But the uproar
10738,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"between the narrow, weed-hung walls annoyed the Grey Cat."
10739,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10740,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Isn’t it almost time,” she said plaintively, “that the person who is"
10741,BELOW THE MILL DAM,paid to understand these things shuts off those vehement drippings with
10742,BELOW THE MILL DAM,that screw-thing on the top of that box-thing.”
10743,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10744,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“They’ll be shut off at eight o’clock as usual,” said Rat; “then we can"
10745,BELOW THE MILL DAM,go to dinner.”
10746,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10747,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“But we shan’t be shut off till ever so late,” said the Waters gaily."
10748,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“We shall keep it up all night.”
10749,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10750,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“The ineradicable offensiveness of youth is partially compensated for
10751,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"by its eternal hopefulness,” said the Cat. “Our dam is not, I am glad"
10752,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"to say, designed to furnish water for more than four hours at a time."
10753,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Reserve is Life.”
10754,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10755,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Thank goodness!” said the Black Rat. “Then they can return to their
10756,BELOW THE MILL DAM,native ditches.”
10757,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10758,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Ditches!” cried the Waters; “Raven’s Gill Brook is no ditch. It is
10759,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"almost navigable, and _we_ come from there away.” They slid over solid"
10760,BELOW THE MILL DAM,and compact till the Wheel thudded under their weight.
10761,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10762,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Raven’s Gill Brook,” said the Rat. “_I_ never heard of Raven’s Gill.”"
10763,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10764,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“We are the waters of Harpenden Brook—down from under Callton Rise.
10765,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Phew! how the race stinks compared with the heather country.” Another
10766,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"five foot of water flung itself against the Wheel, broke, roared,"
10767,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"gurgled, and was gone."
10768,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10769,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Indeed,” said the Grey Cat, “I am sorry to tell you that Raven’s Gill"
10770,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Brook is cut off from this valley by an absolutely impassable range of
10771,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"mountains, and Callton Rise is more than nine miles away. It belongs to"
10772,BELOW THE MILL DAM,another system entirely.”
10773,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10774,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Ah yes,” said the Rat, grinning, “but we forget that, for the young,"
10775,BELOW THE MILL DAM,water always runs uphill.”
10776,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10777,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Oh, hopeless! hopeless! hopeless!” cried the Waters, descending"
10778,BELOW THE MILL DAM,open-palmed upon the Wheel “There is nothing between here and Raven’s
10779,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Gill Brook that a hundred yards of channelling and a few square feet of
10780,BELOW THE MILL DAM,concrete could not remove; and hasn’t removed!”
10781,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10782,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“And Harpenden Brook is north of Raven’s Gill and runs into Raven’s
10783,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Gill at the foot of Callton Rise, where ilex trees are, and _we_ come"
10784,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"from there!” These were the glassy, clear waters of the high chalk."
10785,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10786,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“And Batten’s Ponds, that are fed by springs, have been led through"
10787,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Trott’s Wood, taking the spare water from the old Witches’ Spring under"
10788,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Churt Haw, and we—we—_we_ are their combined waters!” Those were the"
10789,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Waters from the upland bogs and moors—a porter-coloured, dusky, and"
10790,BELOW THE MILL DAM,foam-flecked flood.
10791,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10792,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“It’s all very interesting,” purred the Cat to the sliding waters, “and"
10793,BELOW THE MILL DAM,I have no doubt that Trott’s Woods and Bott’s Woods are tremendously
10794,BELOW THE MILL DAM,important places; but if you could manage to do your work—whose value I
10795,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"don’t in the least dispute—a little more soberly, I, for one, should be"
10796,BELOW THE MILL DAM,grateful.”
10797,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10798,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Book—book—book—book—book—Domesday Book!” The urged Wheel was fairly
10799,BELOW THE MILL DAM,clattering now: “In Burgelstaltone a monk holds of Earl Godwin one hide
10800,BELOW THE MILL DAM,and a half with eight villeins. There is a church—and a monk…. I
10801,BELOW THE MILL DAM,remember that monk. Blessed if he could rattle his rosary off any
10802,BELOW THE MILL DAM,quicker than I am doing now … and wood for seven hogs. I must be
10803,BELOW THE MILL DAM,running twelve to the minute … almost as fast as Steam. Damnable
10804,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"invention, Steam! … Surely it’s time we went to dinner or prayers—or"
10805,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"something. Can’t keep up this pressure, day in and day out, and not"
10806,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"feel it. I don’t mind for myself, of course. _Noblesse oblige_, you"
10807,BELOW THE MILL DAM,know. I’m only thinking of the Upper and the Nether Millstones. They
10808,BELOW THE MILL DAM,came out of the common rock. They can’t be expected to——”
10809,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10810,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Don’t worry on our account, please,” said the Millstones huskily. “So"
10811,BELOW THE MILL DAM,long as you supply the power we’ll supply the weight and the bite.”
10812,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10813,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Isn’t it a trifle blasphemous, though, to work you in this way?”"
10814,BELOW THE MILL DAM,grunted the Wheel. “I seem to remember something about the Mills of God
10815,BELOW THE MILL DAM,grinding ‘slowly.’ _Slowly_ was the word!”
10816,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10817,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“But we are not the Mills of God. We’re only the Upper and the Nether
10818,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Millstones. We have received no instructions to be anything else. We
10819,BELOW THE MILL DAM,are actuated by power transmitted through you.”
10820,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10821,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Ah, but let us be merciful as we are strong. Think of all the"
10822,BELOW THE MILL DAM,beautiful little plants that grow on my woodwork. There are five
10823,BELOW THE MILL DAM,varieties of rare moss within less than one square yard—and all these
10824,BELOW THE MILL DAM,delicate jewels of nature are being grievously knocked about by this
10825,BELOW THE MILL DAM,excessive rush of the water.”
10826,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10827,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Umph!” growled the Millstones. “What with your religious scruples and
10828,BELOW THE MILL DAM,your taste for botany we’d hardly know you for the Wheel that put the
10829,BELOW THE MILL DAM,carter’s son under last autumn. You never worried about _him_!”
10830,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10831,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“He ought to have known better.”
10832,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10833,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“So ought your jewels of nature. Tell ’em to grow where it’s safe.”
10834,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10835,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“How a purely mercantile life debases and brutalises!” said the Cat to
10836,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the Rat.
10837,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10838,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“They were such beautiful little plants too,” said the Rat tenderly."
10839,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Maiden’s-tongue and hart’s-hair fern trellising all over the wall just
10840,BELOW THE MILL DAM,as they do on the sides of churches in the Downs. Think what a joy the
10841,BELOW THE MILL DAM,sight of them must be to our sturdy peasants pulling hay!”
10842,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10843,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Golly!” said the Millstones. “There’s nothing like coming to the heart
10844,BELOW THE MILL DAM,of things for information”; and they returned to the song that all
10845,BELOW THE MILL DAM,English water-mills have sung from time beyond telling:
10846,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10847,BELOW THE MILL DAM,There was a jovial miller once
10848,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Lived on the River Dee,"
10849,BELOW THE MILL DAM,And this the burden of his song
10850,BELOW THE MILL DAM,For ever used to be.
10851,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10852,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10853,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Then, as fresh grist poured in and dulled the note:"
10854,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10855,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"I care for nobody—no not I,"
10856,BELOW THE MILL DAM,And nobody cares for me.
10857,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10858,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10859,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Even these stones have absorbed something of our atmosphere,” said the"
10860,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Grey Cat. “Nine-tenths of the trouble in this world comes from lack of
10861,BELOW THE MILL DAM,detachment.”
10862,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10863,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“One of your people died from forgetting that, didn’t she?” said the"
10864,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Rat.
10865,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10866,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“One only. The example has sufficed us for generations.”
10867,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10868,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Ah! but what happened to Don’t Care?” the Waters demanded.
10869,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10870,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Brutal riding to death of the casual analogy is another mark of
10871,BELOW THE MILL DAM,provincialism!” The Grey Cat raised her tufted chin. “I am going to
10872,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"sleep. With my social obligations I must snatch rest when I can; but,"
10873,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"as our old friend here says, _Noblesse oblige_…. Pity me! Three"
10874,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"functions to-night in the village, and a barn dance across the valley!”"
10875,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10876,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“There’s no chance, I suppose, of your looking in on the loft about"
10877,BELOW THE MILL DAM,two. Some of our young people are going to amuse themselves with a new
10878,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"sacque-dance—best white flour only,” said the Black Rat."
10879,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10880,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“I believe I am officially supposed not to countenance that sort of
10881,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"thing, but youth is youth.… By the way, the humans set my milk-bowl in"
10882,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the loft these days; I hope your youngsters respect it.”
10883,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10884,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“My dear lady,” said the Black Rat, bowing, “you grieve me. You hurt me"
10885,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"inexpressibly. After all these years, too!”"
10886,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10887,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“A general crush is so mixed—highways and hedges—all that sort of
10888,BELOW THE MILL DAM,thing—and no one can answer for one’s best friends. _I_ never try. So
10889,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"long as mine are amusin’ and in full voice, and can hold their own at a"
10890,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"tile-party, I’m as catholic as these mixed waters in the dam here!”"
10891,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10892,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“We aren’t mixed. We _have_ mixed. We are one now,” said the Waters"
10893,BELOW THE MILL DAM,sulkily.
10894,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10895,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Still uttering?” said the Cat. “Never mind, here’s the Miller coming"
10896,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"to shut you off. Ye-es, I have known—_four_—or five is it?—and twenty"
10897,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"leaders of revolt in Faenza…. A little more babble in the dam, a little"
10898,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"more noise in the sluice, a little extra splashing on the wheel, and"
10899,BELOW THE MILL DAM,then——”
10900,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10901,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“They will find that nothing has occurred,” said the Black Rat. “The"
10902,BELOW THE MILL DAM,old things persist and survive and are recognised—our old friend here
10903,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"first of all. By the way,” he turned toward the Wheel, “I believe we"
10904,BELOW THE MILL DAM,have to congratulate you on your latest honour.”
10905,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10906,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Profoundly well deserved—even if he had never—as he has—-laboured
10907,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"strenuously through a long life for the amelioration of millkind,” said"
10908,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"the Cat, who belonged to many tile and outhouse committees. “Doubly"
10909,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"deserved, I may say, for the silent and dignified rebuke his existence"
10910,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"offers to the clattering, fidgety-footed demands of—er—some people."
10911,BELOW THE MILL DAM,What form did the honour take?”
10912,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10913,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“It was,” said the Wheel bashfully, “a machine-moulded pinion.”"
10914,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10915,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Pinions! Oh, how heavenly!” the Black Rat sighed. “I never see a bat"
10916,BELOW THE MILL DAM,without wishing for wings.”
10917,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10918,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Not exactly that sort of pinion,” said the Wheel, “but a really ornate"
10919,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"circle of toothed iron wheels. Absurd, of course, but gratifying. Mr."
10920,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Mangles and an associate herald invested me with it personally—on my
10921,BELOW THE MILL DAM,left rim—the side that you can’t see from the mill. I hadn’t meant to
10922,BELOW THE MILL DAM,say anything about it—or the new steel straps round my axles—bright
10923,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"red, you know—to be worn on all occasions—but, without false modesty, I"
10924,BELOW THE MILL DAM,assure you that the recognition cheered me not a little.”
10925,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10926,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“How intensely gratifying!” said the Black Rat. “I must really steal an
10927,BELOW THE MILL DAM,hour between lights some day and see what they are doing on your left
10928,BELOW THE MILL DAM,side.”
10929,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10930,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“By the way, have you any light on this recent activity of Mr."
10931,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Mangles?” the Grey Cat asked. “He seems to be building small houses on
10932,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"the far side of the tail-race. Believe me, I don’t ask from any vulgar"
10933,BELOW THE MILL DAM,curiosity.”
10934,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10935,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“It affects our Order,” said the Black Rat simply but firmly."
10936,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10937,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Thank you,” said the Wheel. “Let me see if I can tabulate it properly."
10938,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Nothing like system in accounts of all kinds. Book! Book! Book! On the
10939,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"side of the Wheel towards the hundred of Burgelstaltone, where till now"
10940,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"was a stye of three hogs, Mangles, a freeman, with four villeins, and"
10941,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"two carts of two thousand bricks, has a new small house of five yards"
10942,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"and a half, and one roof of iron and a floor of cement. Then, now, and"
10943,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"afterwards beer in large tankards. And Felden, a stranger, with three"
10944,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"villeins and one very great cart, deposits on it one engine of iron and"
10945,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"brass and a small iron mill of four feet, and a broad strap of leather."
10946,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"And Mangles, the builder, with two villeins, constructs the floor for"
10947,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"the same, and a floor of new brick with wires for the small mill. There"
10948,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"are there also chalices filled with iron and water, in number"
10949,BELOW THE MILL DAM,fifty-seven. The whole is valued at one hundred and seventy-four
10950,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"pounds…. I’m sorry I can’t make myself clearer, but you can see for"
10951,BELOW THE MILL DAM,yourself.”
10952,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10953,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Amazingly lucid,” said the Cat. She was the more to be admired because"
10954,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"the language of Domesday Book is not, perhaps, the clearest medium"
10955,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"wherein to describe a small but complete electric-light installation,"
10956,BELOW THE MILL DAM,deriving its power from a water-wheel by means of cogs and gearing.
10957,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10958,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“See for yourself—by all means, see for yourself,” said the Waters,"
10959,BELOW THE MILL DAM,spluttering and choking with mirth.
10960,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10961,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Upon my word,” said the Black Rat furiously, “I may be at fault, but I"
10962,BELOW THE MILL DAM,wholly fail to perceive where these offensive eavesdroppers—er—come in.
10963,BELOW THE MILL DAM,We were discussing a matter that solely affected our Order.”
10964,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10965,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Suddenly they heard, as they had heard many times before, the Miller"
10966,BELOW THE MILL DAM,shutting off the water. To the rattle and rumble of the labouring
10967,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"stones succeeded thick silence, punctuated with little drops from the"
10968,BELOW THE MILL DAM,stayed wheel. Then some water-bird in the dam fluttered her wings as
10969,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"she slid to her nest, and the plop of a water-rat sounded like the fall"
10970,BELOW THE MILL DAM,of a log in the water.
10971,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10972,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“It is all over—it always is all over at just this time. Listen, the"
10973,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Miller is going to bed—as usual. Nothing has occurred,” said the Cat."
10974,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10975,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Something creaked in the house where the pig-styes had stood, as metal"
10976,BELOW THE MILL DAM,engaged on metal with a clink and a burr.
10977,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10978,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Shall I turn her on?” cried the Miller.
10979,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10980,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Ay,” said the voice from the dynamo-house."
10981,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10982,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“A human in Mangles’ new house!” the Rat squeaked.
10983,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10984,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“What of it?” said the Grey Cat. “Even supposing Mr. Mangles’
10985,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"cats’-meat-coloured hovel ululated with humans, can’t you see for"
10986,BELOW THE MILL DAM,yourself—that—?”
10987,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10988,BELOW THE MILL DAM,There was a solid crash of released waters leaping upon the wheel more
10989,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"furiously than ever, a grinding of cogs, a hum like the hum of a"
10990,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"hornet, and then the unvisited darkness of the old mill was scattered"
10991,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"by intolerable white light. It threw up every cobweb, every burl and"
10992,BELOW THE MILL DAM,knot in the beams and the floor; till the shadows behind the flakes of
10993,BELOW THE MILL DAM,rough plaster on the wall lay clear-cut as shadows of mountains on the
10994,BELOW THE MILL DAM,photographed moon.
10995,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10996,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“See! See! See!” hissed the Waters in full flood. “Yes, see for"
10997,BELOW THE MILL DAM,yourselves. Nothing has occurred. Can’t you see?”
10998,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
10999,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"The Rat, amazed, had fallen from his foothold and lay half-stunned on"
11000,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"the floor. The Cat, following her instinct, leaped nigh to the ceiling,"
11001,BELOW THE MILL DAM,and with flattened ears and bared teeth backed in a corner ready to
11002,BELOW THE MILL DAM,fight whatever terror might be loosed on her. But nothing happened.
11003,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Through the long aching minutes nothing whatever happened, and her"
11004,BELOW THE MILL DAM,wire-brush tail returned slowly to its proper shape.
11005,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11006,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Whatever it is,” she said at last, “it’s overdone. They can never keep"
11007,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"it up, you know.”"
11008,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11009,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Much you know,” said the Waters. “Over you go, old man. You can take"
11010,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the full head of us now. Those new steel axle-straps of yours can stand
11011,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"anything. Come along, Raven’s Gill, Harpenden, Callton Rise, Batten’s"
11012,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Ponds, Witches’ Spring, all together! Let’s show these gentlemen how to"
11013,BELOW THE MILL DAM,work!”
11014,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11015,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“But—but—I thought it was a decoration. Why—why—why—it only means more
11016,BELOW THE MILL DAM,work for _me_!”
11017,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11018,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Exactly. You’re to supply about sixty eight-candle lights when
11019,BELOW THE MILL DAM,required. But they won’t be all in use at once——”
11020,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11021,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Ah! I thought as much,” said the Cat. “The reaction is bound to come.”"
11022,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11023,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“_And_,” said the Waters, “you will do the ordinary work of the mill as"
11024,BELOW THE MILL DAM,well.”
11025,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11026,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Impossible!” the old Wheel quivered as it drove. “Aluric never did
11027,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"it—nor Azor, nor Reinbert. Not even William de Warrenne or the Papal"
11028,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Legate. There’s no precedent for it. I tell you there’s no precedent
11029,BELOW THE MILL DAM,for working a wheel like this.”
11030,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11031,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Wait a while! We’re making one as fast as we can. Aluric and Co. are
11032,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"dead. So’s the Papal Legate. You’ve no notion how dead they are, but"
11033,BELOW THE MILL DAM,we’re here—the Waters of Five Separate Systems. We’re just as
11034,BELOW THE MILL DAM,interesting as Domesday Book. Would you like to hear about the
11035,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"land-tenure in Trott’s Wood? It’s squat-right, chiefly.” The mocking"
11036,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Waters leaped one over the other, chuckling and chattering profanely."
11037,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11038,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“In that hundred Jenkins, a tinker, with one dog—_unis canis_—holds, by"
11039,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"the Grace of God and a habit he has of working hard, _unam hidam_—a"
11040,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"large potato patch. Charmin’ fellow, Jenkins. Friend of ours. Now, who"
11041,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the dooce did Jenkins keep? … In the hundred of Callton is one
11042,BELOW THE MILL DAM,charcoal-burner _irreligiosissimus homo_—a bit of a rip—but a thorough
11043,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"sportsman. _Ibi est ecclesia. Non multum_. Not much of a church, _quia_"
11044,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"because, _episcopus_ the Vicar irritated the Nonconformists _tunc et"
11045,BELOW THE MILL DAM,post et modo_—then and afterwards and now—until they built a cut-stone
11046,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Congregational chapel with red brick facings that did not return
11047,BELOW THE MILL DAM,itself—_defendebat se_—at four thousand pounds.”
11048,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11049,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Charcoal-burners, vicars, schismatics, and red brick facings,” groaned"
11050,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the Wheel. “But this is sheer blasphemy. What waters have they let in
11051,BELOW THE MILL DAM,upon me?”
11052,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11053,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Floods from the gutters. Faugh, this light is positively sickening!”"
11054,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"said the Cat, rearranging her fur."
11055,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11056,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“We come down from the clouds or up from the springs, exactly like all"
11057,BELOW THE MILL DAM,other waters everywhere. Is that what’s surprising you?” sang the
11058,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Waters.
11059,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11060,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Of course not. I know my work if you don’t. What I complain of is your
11061,BELOW THE MILL DAM,lack of reverence and repose. You’ve no instinct of deference towards
11062,BELOW THE MILL DAM,your betters—your heartless parody of the Sacred volume (the Wheel
11063,BELOW THE MILL DAM,meant Domesday Book)—proves it.”
11064,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11065,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Our betters?” said the Waters most solemnly. “What is there in all
11066,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"this dammed race that hasn’t come down from the clouds, or——”"
11067,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11068,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Spare me that talk, please,” the Wheel persisted. “You’d _never_"
11069,BELOW THE MILL DAM,understand. It’s the tone—your tone that we object to.”
11070,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11071,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Yes. It’s your tone,” said the Black Rat, picking himself up limb by"
11072,BELOW THE MILL DAM,limb.
11073,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11074,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“If you thought a trifle more about the work you’re supposed to do, and"
11075,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"a trifle less about your precious feelings, you’d render a little more"
11076,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"duty in return for the power vested in you—we mean wasted on you,” the"
11077,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Waters replied.
11078,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11079,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“I have been some hundreds of years laboriously acquiring the knowledge
11080,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"which you see fit to challenge so light-heartedly,” the Wheel jarred."
11081,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11082,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Challenge him! Challenge him!” clamoured the little waves riddling
11083,BELOW THE MILL DAM,down through the tail-race. “As well now as later. Take him up!”
11084,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11085,BELOW THE MILL DAM,The main mass of the Waters plunging on the Wheel shocked that
11086,BELOW THE MILL DAM,well-bolted structure almost into box-lids by saying: “Very good. Tell
11087,BELOW THE MILL DAM,us what you suppose yourself to be doing at the present moment.”
11088,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11089,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Waiving the offensive form of your question, I answer, purely as a"
11090,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"matter of courtesy, that I am engaged in the trituration of farinaceous"
11091,BELOW THE MILL DAM,substances whose ultimate destination it would be a breach of the trust
11092,BELOW THE MILL DAM,reposed in me to reveal.”
11093,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11094,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Fiddle!” said the Waters. “We knew it all along! The first direct
11095,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"question shows his ignorance of his own job. Listen, old thing. Thanks"
11096,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"to us, you are now actuating a machine of whose construction you know"
11097,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"nothing, that that machine may, over wires of whose ramifications you"
11098,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"are, by your very position, profoundly ignorant, deliver a power which"
11099,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"you can never realise, to localities beyond the extreme limits of your"
11100,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"mental horizon, with the object of producing phenomena which in your"
11101,BELOW THE MILL DAM,wildest dreams (if you ever dream) you could never comprehend. Is that
11102,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"clear, or would you like it all in words of four syllables?”"
11103,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11104,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Your assumptions are deliciously sweeping, but may I point out that a"
11105,BELOW THE MILL DAM,decent and—the dear old Abbot of Wilton would have put it in his
11106,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"resonant monkish Latin much better than I can—a scholarly reserve, does"
11107,BELOW THE MILL DAM,not necessarily connote blank vacuity of mind on all subjects.”
11108,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11109,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Ah, the dear old Abbot of Wilton,” said the Rat sympathetically, as"
11110,BELOW THE MILL DAM,one nursed in that bosom. “Charmin’ fellow—thorough scholar and
11111,BELOW THE MILL DAM,gentleman. Such a pity!”
11112,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11113,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Oh, Sacred Fountains!” the Waters were fairly boiling. “He goes out of"
11114,BELOW THE MILL DAM,his way to expose his ignorance by triple bucketfuls. He creaks to high
11115,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Heaven that he is hopelessly behind the common order of things! He
11116,BELOW THE MILL DAM,invites the streams of Five Watersheds to witness his su-su-su-pernal
11117,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"incompetence, and then he talks as though there were untold reserves of"
11118,BELOW THE MILL DAM,knowledge behind him that he is too modest to bring forward. For a
11119,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"bland, circular, absolutely sincere impostor, you’re a miracle, O"

11121,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11122,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“I do not pretend to be anything more than an integral portion of an

11124,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11125,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Quite so,” said the Waters. “Then go round—hard——”"
11126,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11127,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“To what end?” asked the Wheel.
11128,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11129,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Till a big box of tanks in your house begins to fizz and fume—gassing

11131,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11132,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“It would be,” said the Cat, sniffing."
11133,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11134,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“That will show that your accumulators are full. When the accumulators
11135,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"are exhausted, and the lights burn badly, you will find us whacking you"

11137,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11138,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“The end of life as decreed by Mangles and his creatures is to go

11140,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11141,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“In order,” the Rat said, “that you may throw raw and unnecessary"
11142,BELOW THE MILL DAM,illumination upon all the unloveliness in the world. Unloveliness which
11143,BELOW THE MILL DAM,we shall—er—have always with us. At the same time you will riotously
11144,BELOW THE MILL DAM,neglect the so-called little but vital graces that make up Life.”
11145,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11146,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Yes, Life,” said the Cat, “with its dim delicious half-tones and"
11147,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"veiled indeterminate distances. Its surprisals, escapes, encounters,"
11148,BELOW THE MILL DAM,and dizzying leaps—its full-throated choruses in honour of the morning

11150,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11151,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Oh, you can go on the tiles, Pussalina, just the same as usual,” said"

11153,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11154,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“On the tiles, forsooth!” hissed the Cat."
11155,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11156,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Well, that’s what it amounts to,” persisted the Waters. “We see a good"

11158,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11159,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“And—but I fear I speak to deaf ears—do they never impress you?” said
11160,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the Wheel.
11161,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11162,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Enormously,” said the Waters. “We have already learned six refined"

11164,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11165,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“But (here again I feel as though preaching in the wilderness) it never

11167,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"wholly animal—ah—rumination of bovine minds and the discerning,"
11168,BELOW THE MILL DAM,well-apportioned leisure of the finer type of intellect?”
11169,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11170,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Oh, yes. The bovine mind goes to sleep under a hedge and makes no"
11171,BELOW THE MILL DAM,bones about it when it’s shouted at. We’ve seen _that_—in
11172,BELOW THE MILL DAM,haying-time—all along the meadows. The finer type is wide awake enough
11173,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"to fudge up excuses for shirking, and mean enough to get stuffy when"

11175,BELOW THE MILL DAM,

11180,BELOW THE MILL DAM,What are you giving us? D’you suppose we’ve scoured half heaven in the
11181,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"clouds, and half earth in the mists, to be taken in at this time of the"
11182,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"day by a bone-idle, old hand-quern of your type?”"
11183,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11184,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“It is not for me to bandy personalities with you. I can only say that
11185,BELOW THE MILL DAM,I simply decline to accept the situation.”
11186,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11187,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Decline away. It doesn’t make any odds. They’ll probably put in a
11188,BELOW THE MILL DAM,turbine if you decline too much.”
11189,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11190,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“What’s a turbine?” said the Wheel, quickly."
11191,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11192,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“A little thing you don’t see, that performs surprising revolutions."
11193,BELOW THE MILL DAM,But you won’t decline. You’ll hang on to your two nice red-strapped
11194,BELOW THE MILL DAM,axles and your new machine-moulded pinions like—a—like a leech on a
11195,BELOW THE MILL DAM,lily stem! There’s centuries of work in your old bones if you’d only
11196,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"apply yourself to it; and, mechanically, an overshot wheel with this"
11197,BELOW THE MILL DAM,head of water is about as efficient as a turbine.”
11198,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11199,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“So in future I am to be considered mechanically? I have been painted
11200,BELOW THE MILL DAM,by at least five Royal Academicians.”
11201,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11202,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Oh, you can be painted by five hundred when you aren’t at work, of"
11203,BELOW THE MILL DAM,course. But while you are at work you’ll work. You won’t half-stop and
11204,BELOW THE MILL DAM,think and talk about rare plants and dicky-birds and farinaceous
11205,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"fiduciary interests. You’ll continue to revolve, and this new head of"
11206,BELOW THE MILL DAM,water will see that you do so continue.”
11207,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11208,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“It is a matter on which it would be exceedingly ill-advised to form a
11209,BELOW THE MILL DAM,hasty or a premature conclusion. I will give it my most careful
11210,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"consideration,” said the Wheel."
11211,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11212,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Please do,” said the Waters gravely. “Hullo! Here’s the Miller again.”"
11213,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11214,BELOW THE MILL DAM,The Cat coiled herself in a picturesque attitude on the softest corner
11215,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"of a sack, and the Rat without haste, yet certainly without rest,"
11216,BELOW THE MILL DAM,slipped behind the sacking as though an appointment had just occurred
11217,BELOW THE MILL DAM,to him.
11218,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11219,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"In the doorway, with the young Engineer, stood the Miller grinning"
11220,BELOW THE MILL DAM,amazedly.
11221,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11222,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Well—well—well! ’tis true-ly won’erful. An’ what a power o’ dirt! It
11223,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"come over me now looking at these lights, that I’ve never rightly seen"
11224,BELOW THE MILL DAM,my own mill before. She needs a lot bein’ done to her.”
11225,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11226,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Ah! I suppose one must make oneself moderately agreeable to the baser
11227,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"sort. They have their uses. This thing controls the dairy.” The Cat,"
11228,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"pincing on her toes, came forward and rubbed her head against the"
11229,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Miller’s knee.
11230,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11231,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Ay, you pretty puss,” he said, stooping. “You’re as big a cheat as the"
11232,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"rest of ’em that catch no mice about me. A won’erful smooth-skinned,"
11233,BELOW THE MILL DAM,rough-tongued cheat you be. I’ve more than half a mind——”
11234,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11235,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“She does her work well,” said the Engineer, pointing to where the"
11236,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Rat’s beady eyes showed behind the sacking. “Cats and Rats livin’
11237,BELOW THE MILL DAM,together—see?”
11238,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11239,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Too much they do—too long they’ve done. I’m sick and tired of it. Go
11240,BELOW THE MILL DAM,and take a swim and larn to find your own vittles honest when you come
11241,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"out, Pussy.”"
11242,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11243,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“My word!” said the Waters, as a sprawling Cat landed all unannounced"
11244,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"in the centre of the tail-race. “Is that you, Mewsalina? You seem to"
11245,BELOW THE MILL DAM,have been quarrelling with your best friend. Get over to the left. It’s
11246,BELOW THE MILL DAM,shallowest there. Up on that alder-root with all four paws.
11247,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Good-night!”
11248,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11249,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“You’ll never get any they rats,” said the Miller, as the young"
11250,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Engineer struck wrathfully with his stick at the sacking. “They’re not
11251,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the common sort. They’re the old black English sort.”
11252,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11253,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Are they, by Jove? I must catch one to stuff, some day.”"
11254,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11255,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11256,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Six months later, in the chill of a January afternoon, they were"
11257,BELOW THE MILL DAM,letting in the Waters as usual.
11258,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11259,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Come along! It’s both gears this evening,” said the Wheel, kicking"
11260,BELOW THE MILL DAM,joyously in the first rush of the icy stream. “There’s a heavy load of
11261,BELOW THE MILL DAM,grist just in from Lamber’s Wood. Eleven miles it came in an hour and a
11262,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"half in our new motor-lorry, and the Miller’s rigged five new"
11263,BELOW THE MILL DAM,five-candle lights in his cow-stables. I’m feeding ’em to-night.
11264,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"There’s a cow due to calve. Oh, while I think of it, what’s the news"
11265,BELOW THE MILL DAM,from Callton Rise?”
11266,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11267,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“The waters are finding their level as usual—but why do you ask?” said
11268,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the deep outpouring Waters.
11269,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11270,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Because Mangles and Felden and the Miller are talking of increasing
11271,BELOW THE MILL DAM,the plant here and running a saw-mill by electricity. I was wondering
11272,BELOW THE MILL DAM,whether we——”
11273,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11274,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“I beg your pardon,” said the Waters chuckling. “_What_ did you say?”"
11275,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11276,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Whether _we_, of course, had power enough for the job. It will be a"
11277,BELOW THE MILL DAM,biggish contract. There’s all Harpenden Brook to be considered and
11278,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"Batten’s Ponds as well, and Witches’ Fountain, and the Churt’s Hawd"
11279,BELOW THE MILL DAM,system.
11280,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11281,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“We’ve power enough for anything in the world,” said the Waters. “The"
11282,BELOW THE MILL DAM,only question is whether you could stand the strain if we came down on
11283,BELOW THE MILL DAM,you full head.”
11284,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11285,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Of course I can,” said the Wheel. “Mangles is going to turn me into a"
11286,BELOW THE MILL DAM,set of turbines—beauties.”
11287,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11288,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Oh—er—I suppose it’s the frost that has made us a little thick-headed,"
11289,BELOW THE MILL DAM,but to whom are we talking?” asked the amazed Waters.
11290,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11291,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“To me—the Spirit of the Mill, of course.”"
11292,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11293,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Not to the old Wheel, then?”"
11294,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11295,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“I happen to be living in the old Wheel just at present. When the
11296,BELOW THE MILL DAM,turbines are installed I shall go and live in them. What earthly
11297,BELOW THE MILL DAM,difference does it make?”
11298,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11299,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Absolutely none,” said the Waters, “in the earth or in the waters"
11300,BELOW THE MILL DAM,under the earth. But we thought turbines didn’t appeal to you.”
11301,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11302,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Not like turbines? Me? My dear fellows, turbines are good for fifteen"
11303,BELOW THE MILL DAM,hundred revolutions a minute—and with our power we can drive ’em at
11304,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"full speed. Why, there’s nothing we couldn’t grind or saw or illuminate"
11305,BELOW THE MILL DAM,or heat with a set of turbines! That’s to say if all the Five
11306,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Watersheds are agreeable.”
11307,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11308,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Oh, we’ve been agreeable for ever so long.”"
11309,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11310,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Then why didn’t you tell me?”
11311,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11312,BELOW THE MILL DAM,“Don’t know. Suppose it slipped our memory.”
11313,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11314,BELOW THE MILL DAM,The Waters were holding themselves in for fear of bursting with mirth.
11315,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11316,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“How careless of you! You should keep abreast of the age, my dear"
11317,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"fellows. We might have settled it long ago, if you’d only spoken. Yes,"
11318,BELOW THE MILL DAM,four good turbines and a neat brick penstock—eh? This old Wheel’s
11319,BELOW THE MILL DAM,absurdly out of date.”
11320,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11321,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"“Well,” said the Cat, who after a little proud seclusion had returned"
11322,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"to her place impenitent as ever. “Praised be Pasht and the Old Gods,"
11323,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"that whatever may have happened _I_, at least, have preserved the"
11324,BELOW THE MILL DAM,Spirit of the Mill!”
11325,BELOW THE MILL DAM,
11326,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"She looked round as expecting her faithful ally, the Black Rat; but"
11327,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"that very week the Engineer had caught and stuffed him, and had put him"
11328,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"in a glass case; he being a genuine old English black rat. That breed,"
11329,BELOW THE MILL DAM,"the report says, is rapidly diminishing before the incursions of the"
11330,BELOW THE MILL DAM,brown variety.
