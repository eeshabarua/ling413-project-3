26,LITTLE ENGEL.,LITTLE ENGEL.
27,LITTLE ENGEL.,
28,LITTLE ENGEL.,
29,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Engel, he"
30,LITTLE ENGEL.,So handsome was and gay;
31,LITTLE ENGEL.,To Upland rode he on a tide
32,LITTLE ENGEL.,And bore a maid away.
33,LITTLE ENGEL.,
34,LITTLE ENGEL.,In ill hour he to Upland rode
35,LITTLE ENGEL.,And made a maid his prize;
36,LITTLE ENGEL.,The first night they together lay
37,LITTLE ENGEL.,Was down by Vesteryse.
38,LITTLE ENGEL.,
39,LITTLE ENGEL.,It was the little Engel he
40,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Awoke at black midnight,"
41,LITTLE ENGEL.,And straight begins his dream to state
42,LITTLE ENGEL.,In terror and affright.
43,LITTLE ENGEL.,
44,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Methought the wolf-whelp and his dam,"
45,LITTLE ENGEL.,"The laidly she-wolf gray,"
46,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Tore out my heart, and twixt their teeth"
47,LITTLE ENGEL.,Did hold it as I lay.”
48,LITTLE ENGEL.,
49,LITTLE ENGEL.,“That thou dream’st little Engel thus
50,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Can cause slight wonderment,"
51,LITTLE ENGEL.,When me thou’st ta’en by might and main
52,LITTLE ENGEL.,Nor asked my friends’ consent.”
53,LITTLE ENGEL.,
54,LITTLE ENGEL.,In came Solwey Johnsen then
55,LITTLE ENGEL.,And stood before the table;
56,LITTLE ENGEL.,"He was I ween, a clever lad,"
57,LITTLE ENGEL.,And well to speak was able.
58,LITTLE ENGEL.,
59,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Hear thou, my lord, Little Engel,"
60,LITTLE ENGEL.,Rise up and straight begone;
61,LITTLE ENGEL.,For here Sir Godey Loumand comes
62,LITTLE ENGEL.,By four ways to the town.”
63,LITTLE ENGEL.,
64,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“I fear not four, Solwey Johnsen,"
65,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Nor five fear I, nor ten!"
66,LITTLE ENGEL.,"I fear not Godey Sir Loumand, though"
67,LITTLE ENGEL.,He come with thirty men.”
68,LITTLE ENGEL.,
69,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“O there are more than four, Sir,"
70,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Or five, Sir, or than ten;"
71,LITTLE ENGEL.,Here cometh Godey Sir Loumand with
72,LITTLE ENGEL.,A hundred armed men.”
73,LITTLE ENGEL.,
74,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Engel, he"
75,LITTLE ENGEL.,Took Malfred in his arm:
76,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Now, dearest heart, some counsel give"
77,LITTLE ENGEL.,May free us from this harm.”
78,LITTLE ENGEL.,
79,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Engel, her"
80,LITTLE ENGEL.,Upon the white cheek kiss’d:
81,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Now do thou hear, my bosom’s dear,"
82,LITTLE ENGEL.,With counsel us assist.”
83,LITTLE ENGEL.,
84,LITTLE ENGEL.,“The best advice that I can give
85,LITTLE ENGEL.,I’ll give thee in this case;
86,LITTLE ENGEL.,"To Mary’s Church we will retire,"
87,LITTLE ENGEL.,They’ll ne’er destroy that place.
88,LITTLE ENGEL.,
89,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“We’ll gold and silver take, and on"
90,LITTLE ENGEL.,The scale we’ll pile them high;
91,LITTLE ENGEL.,To-morrow from the Churchmen we
92,LITTLE ENGEL.,The holy place will buy.
93,LITTLE ENGEL.,
94,LITTLE ENGEL.,“Around you call your merry men all
95,LITTLE ENGEL.,To whom you’ve given bread;
96,LITTLE ENGEL.,For refuge we to the Kirk will flee
97,LITTLE ENGEL.,Since we are thus bestead.
98,LITTLE ENGEL.,
99,LITTLE ENGEL.,“Do you take all your merry men who
100,LITTLE ENGEL.,Your coursers’ backs have prest;
101,LITTLE ENGEL.,"We’ll hie us to our Lady’s church,"
102,LITTLE ENGEL.,And set our hearts at rest.
103,LITTLE ENGEL.,
104,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“That’s the best counsel, love, I know,"
105,LITTLE ENGEL.,A simple woman I;
106,LITTLE ENGEL.,"In Mary’s house we’ll lock ourselves,"
107,LITTLE ENGEL.,And there our foes defy.”
108,LITTLE ENGEL.,
109,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Engel,"
110,LITTLE ENGEL.,Into the church he went:
111,LITTLE ENGEL.,Sir Loumand to beleaguer him
112,LITTLE ENGEL.,A hundred men has sent.
113,LITTLE ENGEL.,
114,LITTLE ENGEL.,Before the kirk his men they lay
115,LITTLE ENGEL.,Till full five months were past;
116,LITTLE ENGEL.,It was Godey Sir Loumand
117,LITTLE ENGEL.,So wrathful grew at last.
118,LITTLE ENGEL.,
119,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Then spake the mother of little Malfred,"
120,LITTLE ENGEL.,With hate ’gainst her was fill’d:
121,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“The Kirk of Maria burn with fire,"
122,LITTLE ENGEL.,And it with gold rebuild.”
123,LITTLE ENGEL.,
124,LITTLE ENGEL.,"The fire began to burn, to burn,"
125,LITTLE ENGEL.,The sparkles in they flew;
126,LITTLE ENGEL.,"At that adread was little Malfred,"
127,LITTLE ENGEL.,And ashy pale she grew.
128,LITTLE ENGEL.,
129,LITTLE ENGEL.,It was so hot in the Kirk yard when
130,LITTLE ENGEL.,Abroad the blazes sped;
131,LITTLE ENGEL.,But in the Kirk still hotter when
132,LITTLE ENGEL.,In poured the melted lead.
133,LITTLE ENGEL.,
134,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Malfred,"
135,LITTLE ENGEL.,So frantic was her mood:
136,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“O let us quick the horses stick,"
137,LITTLE ENGEL.,And cool us with their blood.”
138,LITTLE ENGEL.,
139,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Then little Engel answer made,"
140,LITTLE ENGEL.,As on the floor he stood:
141,LITTLE ENGEL.,“But coolness small shall we derive
142,LITTLE ENGEL.,From our good coursers’ blood.”
143,LITTLE ENGEL.,
144,LITTLE ENGEL.,Answered the groom who loved the steeds
145,LITTLE ENGEL.,As dearly as his breath:
146,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Ye’d better little Malfred stick,"
147,LITTLE ENGEL.,She well deserveth death.”
148,LITTLE ENGEL.,
149,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Engel,"
150,LITTLE ENGEL.,His arms round Malfred twin’d:
151,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“No death hast thou deserved from us,"
152,LITTLE ENGEL.,And none from us shalt find.
153,LITTLE ENGEL.,
154,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“My little Malfred, do thou hear"
155,LITTLE ENGEL.,What I now say to thee;
156,LITTLE ENGEL.,"If a son this year thou chance to bear,"
157,LITTLE ENGEL.,That son name after me.”
158,LITTLE ENGEL.,
159,LITTLE ENGEL.,"They placed her on a buckler,"
160,LITTLE ENGEL.,"They placed their spears below,"
161,LITTLE ENGEL.,And through the window lifted her
162,LITTLE ENGEL.,With hearts so full of woe.
163,LITTLE ENGEL.,
164,LITTLE ENGEL.,It was the little Malfred round
165,LITTLE ENGEL.,"The church goes staggering now,"
166,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Scorched were her scarlet robes, and scorched"
167,LITTLE ENGEL.,The ringlets on her brow.
168,LITTLE ENGEL.,
169,LITTLE ENGEL.,It was the little Malfred fell
170,LITTLE ENGEL.,Upon her white bare knee:
171,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“O may I bear a son this year,"
172,LITTLE ENGEL.,The avenger of this to be.”
173,LITTLE ENGEL.,
174,LITTLE ENGEL.,So they the little Malfred took
175,LITTLE ENGEL.,"And in a mantle roll’d,"
176,LITTLE ENGEL.,And sorrowfully lifted her
177,LITTLE ENGEL.,Upon a courser bold.
178,LITTLE ENGEL.,
179,LITTLE ENGEL.,Outspake the little Malfred when
180,LITTLE ENGEL.,She reached the verdant plain:
181,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Burnt is our Lady’s house this day,"
182,LITTLE ENGEL.,And burnt so bold a swain.
183,LITTLE ENGEL.,
184,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Burnt is our Lady’s house, and burnt"
185,LITTLE ENGEL.,Therein so brave a swain;
186,LITTLE ENGEL.,His equal till the day of doom
187,LITTLE ENGEL.,We ne’er shall see again.”
188,LITTLE ENGEL.,
189,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It happened in the autumn tide,"
190,LITTLE ENGEL.,"The autumn of that year,"
191,LITTLE ENGEL.,"That she within her secret bower,"
192,LITTLE ENGEL.,A beauteous boy did bear.
193,LITTLE ENGEL.,
194,LITTLE ENGEL.,"To the holy Kirk they carried him,"
195,LITTLE ENGEL.,They christened him at night;
196,LITTLE ENGEL.,"They called him little Engel, and"
197,LITTLE ENGEL.,Concealed him whilst they might.
198,LITTLE ENGEL.,
199,LITTLE ENGEL.,"They fostered him for winter one,"
200,LITTLE ENGEL.,"And so on, till he grew"
201,LITTLE ENGEL.,The fairest knight beneath the sun
202,LITTLE ENGEL.,That you did ever view.
203,LITTLE ENGEL.,
204,LITTLE ENGEL.,So well he grew and throve until
205,LITTLE ENGEL.,Seven years had passed away:
206,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Thy uncle slew thy sire, my boy,"
207,LITTLE ENGEL.,"For the first time, that I say.”"
208,LITTLE ENGEL.,
209,LITTLE ENGEL.,Still with his mother he remained
210,LITTLE ENGEL.,Till five more years were sped:
211,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Thy uncle slew thy father, boy,”"
212,LITTLE ENGEL.,He heard most often said.
213,LITTLE ENGEL.,
214,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Now do thou hear, my mother dear,"
215,LITTLE ENGEL.,Who sittest clad in pall;
216,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Up under Oe I’ll riding go,"
217,LITTLE ENGEL.,And serve in the Monarch’s hall.”
218,LITTLE ENGEL.,
219,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Yes, ride thee hence to Court, and there"
220,LITTLE ENGEL.,To win thee honor try;
221,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Forget not who thy father slew,"
222,LITTLE ENGEL.,For the last time I cry.”
223,LITTLE ENGEL.,
224,LITTLE ENGEL.,He served so long at court that he
225,LITTLE ENGEL.,His friend the Dane King made;
226,LITTLE ENGEL.,With heavy heart he’d sit apart
227,LITTLE ENGEL.,Whilst others laugh’d and play’d.
228,LITTLE ENGEL.,
229,LITTLE ENGEL.,The Danish King observed at last
230,LITTLE ENGEL.,He grieved at seasons all:
231,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Now hear, good youth, I’d know forsooth"
232,LITTLE ENGEL.,Why thou art sorrow’s thrall.
233,LITTLE ENGEL.,
234,LITTLE ENGEL.,“Thou grievest like the little bird
235,LITTLE ENGEL.,The greenwood bough upon;
236,LITTLE ENGEL.,Thou seemest like the lonely wight
237,LITTLE ENGEL.,Whose friends are dead and gone.”
238,LITTLE ENGEL.,
239,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Now do thou hear, thou King of the Danes,"
240,LITTLE ENGEL.,With grief I down am weigh’d;
241,LITTLE ENGEL.,"My uncle slew my sire of old,"
242,LITTLE ENGEL.,And no atonement made.”
243,LITTLE ENGEL.,
244,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“If thou wilt up of the country ride,"
245,LITTLE ENGEL.,"And well avenge that deed,"
246,LITTLE ENGEL.,As many of my men to thee
247,LITTLE ENGEL.,"I’ll lend, as thou shalt need."
248,LITTLE ENGEL.,
249,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“If thou’lt avenge thy father’s death,"
250,LITTLE ENGEL.,Thou shalt have fitting aid;
251,LITTLE ENGEL.,Three hundred of my men to thee
252,LITTLE ENGEL.,"I’ll lend, in steel array’d.”"
253,LITTLE ENGEL.,
254,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Engel, he"
255,LITTLE ENGEL.,Rides in the greenwood shade;
256,LITTLE ENGEL.,"He marshals there his good men all,"
257,LITTLE ENGEL.,And sets him at their head.
258,LITTLE ENGEL.,
259,LITTLE ENGEL.,"In haste came in the little footboy,"
260,LITTLE ENGEL.,And stood before the table;
261,LITTLE ENGEL.,"He was I ween a clever lad,"
262,LITTLE ENGEL.,And well to speak was able.
263,LITTLE ENGEL.,
264,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Now hear, Sir Godey Loumand, hear,"
265,LITTLE ENGEL.,Arise and straight begone;
266,LITTLE ENGEL.,Little Engel’s coming with his troop
267,LITTLE ENGEL.,By four ways to the town.
268,LITTLE ENGEL.,
269,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Little Engel’s coming with his troop,"
270,LITTLE ENGEL.,And he’ll be on us soon;
271,LITTLE ENGEL.,"And wroth is he, as wroth can be,"
272,LITTLE ENGEL.,His war-lance scrapes the moon.”
273,LITTLE ENGEL.,
274,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“At Stevn and Ting, my boy, I’ve been,"
275,LITTLE ENGEL.,And wherever people mingle;
276,LITTLE ENGEL.,"But ne’er, I swear, have I been where"
277,LITTLE ENGEL.,I’ve heard of little Engel.”
278,LITTLE ENGEL.,
279,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was Godey Sir Loumand,"
280,LITTLE ENGEL.,He stroked the page’s cheek;
281,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“If thou canst give any good advice,"
282,LITTLE ENGEL.,"My pretty footboy, speak.”"
283,LITTLE ENGEL.,
284,LITTLE ENGEL.,“If I can give any good advice
285,LITTLE ENGEL.,Most certainly I will;
286,LITTLE ENGEL.,In your stone bower yourself immure
287,LITTLE ENGEL.,From the approaching ill.
288,LITTLE ENGEL.,
289,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“The walls they are of marble stone,"
290,LITTLE ENGEL.,The doors they are of lead;
291,LITTLE ENGEL.,"’Twill wondrous be, my lord, if we"
292,LITTLE ENGEL.,Therein are prisoners made.”
293,LITTLE ENGEL.,
294,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Engel, he"
295,LITTLE ENGEL.,Halted a while to gaze:
296,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“O there doth lie the Kirk, where died"
297,LITTLE ENGEL.,My sire in smoke and blaze.
298,LITTLE ENGEL.,
299,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“And there doth stand the castle, where"
300,LITTLE ENGEL.,My uncle doth reside;
301,LITTLE ENGEL.,The amends that he shall pay this day
302,LITTLE ENGEL.,The Lord in heaven decide.”
303,LITTLE ENGEL.,
304,LITTLE ENGEL.,"By four ways they the bower beset,"
305,LITTLE ENGEL.,And for admission call:
306,LITTLE ENGEL.,"The little Engel, sprightly elf,"
307,LITTLE ENGEL.,Was foremost of them all.
308,LITTLE ENGEL.,
309,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was Godey Sir Loumand, through"
310,LITTLE ENGEL.,The casement out looked he:
311,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Now hark, ye knaves, bid your captain tell"
312,LITTLE ENGEL.,Why ye bawl so furiously?”
313,LITTLE ENGEL.,
314,LITTLE ENGEL.,Then answered little Engel straight
315,LITTLE ENGEL.,Beneath his mantle ruddy:
316,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Engel he’s stiled, your sister’s child,"
317,LITTLE ENGEL.,"And I am he, Sir Godey.”"
318,LITTLE ENGEL.,
319,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Then answered Godey Sir Loumand, he"
320,LITTLE ENGEL.,Was surely wroth thereat:
321,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Ride hence, and boast not of thy birth,"
322,LITTLE ENGEL.,Thou art a bastard brat.”
323,LITTLE ENGEL.,
324,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“And though a bastard brat I be,"
325,LITTLE ENGEL.,My fortune’s not the worse;
326,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Enough I hold of silver and gold,"
327,LITTLE ENGEL.,And ride on a gallant horse.
328,LITTLE ENGEL.,
329,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“And if a bastard brat I be,"
330,LITTLE ENGEL.,Thou mad’st me that I trow;
331,LITTLE ENGEL.,"But still I’ve towers, and pleasant bowers,"
332,LITTLE ENGEL.,And of green woods enow.
333,LITTLE ENGEL.,
334,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“My sire thou slew’st, and no amends"
335,LITTLE ENGEL.,To me didst ever make;
336,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Now scoff thou hast upon me cast,"
337,LITTLE ENGEL.,For which thy life I’ll take.
338,LITTLE ENGEL.,
339,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Bring gold, my merry men, and that"
340,LITTLE ENGEL.,Before the threshold lay;
341,LITTLE ENGEL.,"We’ll burn the bower this very hour,"
342,LITTLE ENGEL.,We well for it can pay.”
343,LITTLE ENGEL.,
344,LITTLE ENGEL.,’Twas hot within the foreroom when
345,LITTLE ENGEL.,The fire began to roar;
346,LITTLE ENGEL.,"But hotter in the stone bower, when"
347,LITTLE ENGEL.,The lead began to pour.
348,LITTLE ENGEL.,
349,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Engel, he"
350,LITTLE ENGEL.,His courser never turned
351,LITTLE ENGEL.,To ride away from the castelaye
352,LITTLE ENGEL.,Before the bower was burned.
353,LITTLE ENGEL.,
354,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Away at last he rode, and waved"
355,LITTLE ENGEL.,"His hand in exultation,"
356,LITTLE ENGEL.,Upon espying his uncle lying
357,LITTLE ENGEL.,Amidst the conflagration.
358,LITTLE ENGEL.,
359,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Said little Engel, when he saw"
360,LITTLE ENGEL.,His uncle’s body shrink:
361,LITTLE ENGEL.,“Now thou hast quaffed the self same draught
362,LITTLE ENGEL.,Thou mad’st my father drink.”
363,LITTLE ENGEL.,
364,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the little Engel, rode"
365,LITTLE ENGEL.,Home to his mother’s hall;
366,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Before it stood his mother good,"
367,LITTLE ENGEL.,So fair arrayed in pall.
368,LITTLE ENGEL.,
369,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Here dost thou stand, my mother dear,"
370,LITTLE ENGEL.,Arrayed in robes of pall;
371,LITTLE ENGEL.,"I’ve ridden up the land, and well"
372,LITTLE ENGEL.,Avenged my father’s fall.”
373,LITTLE ENGEL.,
374,LITTLE ENGEL.,"It was the fair Dame Malfred, wrung"
375,LITTLE ENGEL.,Her hands and wept amain:
376,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“I’d but one care before to bear,"
377,LITTLE ENGEL.,"And now, alas, have twain!”"
378,LITTLE ENGEL.,
379,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Dear mother, thou wouldst have it so,"
380,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Now thee in tears I find,"
381,LITTLE ENGEL.,When duteously thy will I’ve done:
382,LITTLE ENGEL.,How strange is woman’s mind!”
383,LITTLE ENGEL.,
384,LITTLE ENGEL.,"He turned his steed and rode away,"
385,LITTLE ENGEL.,His face with anger red;
386,LITTLE ENGEL.,"With dishevelled hair, the Dame stood there,"
387,LITTLE ENGEL.,Such woeful tears she shed.
388,LITTLE ENGEL.,
389,LITTLE ENGEL.,The little Engel hied him to
390,LITTLE ENGEL.,The King his master’s court;
391,LITTLE ENGEL.,"Abroad the Dane King stood, and hailed"
392,LITTLE ENGEL.,The youth in kindest sort.
393,LITTLE ENGEL.,
394,LITTLE ENGEL.,Into the hall Sir Engel then
395,LITTLE ENGEL.,With the good monarch went:
396,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“My choicest thanks, thou noble King,"
397,LITTLE ENGEL.,For thy brave warriors lent.
398,LITTLE ENGEL.,
399,LITTLE ENGEL.,"“Now I’ve avenged my father’s death,"
400,LITTLE ENGEL.,Burnt is Sir Godey’s bower;
401,LITTLE ENGEL.,"And he therein has found a tomb,"
402,LITTLE ENGEL.,Who slew my sire of yore.”

409,AN ELEGY.,
410,AN ELEGY.,"Where shall I rest my hapless head,"
411,AN ELEGY.,Heavy with grief? how plenteously
412,AN ELEGY.,Must I the briny torrents shed—
413,AN ELEGY.,_Alack and woe is me_!
414,AN ELEGY.,
415,AN ELEGY.,"Our chief is gone, at last, at last,"
416,AN ELEGY.,The safeguard of our nation he;
417,AN ELEGY.,The glory of our age is past—
418,AN ELEGY.,_Alack and woe is me_!
419,AN ELEGY.,
420,AN ELEGY.,"Unto the swords, O father dear,"
421,AN ELEGY.,Of foemen thirsting horribly
422,AN ELEGY.,"For blood, why leave thy children here?"
423,AN ELEGY.,_Alack and woe is me_!
424,AN ELEGY.,
425,AN ELEGY.,"Of justice is the fountain dried,"
426,AN ELEGY.,And mute the law’s high symphony;
427,AN ELEGY.,Fallen is Europa’s brightest pride—

429,AN ELEGY.,
430,AN ELEGY.,There is a change of times and things
431,AN ELEGY.,That passeth on eternally.

433,AN ELEGY.,_’Tis right_—_but woe is me_!
434,AN ELEGY.,
435,AN ELEGY.,"Now is the earth with violets gay,"
436,AN ELEGY.,And flowers manifold to see;
437,AN ELEGY.,Now frozen ’neath the winter’s sway—
438,AN ELEGY.,_How brief the roses be_!
439,AN ELEGY.,
440,AN ELEGY.,Now shews the sun his head of gold
441,AN ELEGY.,With a superior brilliancy;
442,AN ELEGY.,Now hides as were he dead and cold—
443,AN ELEGY.,_Alack and woe is me_.
444,AN ELEGY.,
445,AN ELEGY.,O father! I will lave thy tomb
446,AN ELEGY.,With tear-drops well becoming me;
447,AN ELEGY.,Thy tomb with flowery herbs perfume—
