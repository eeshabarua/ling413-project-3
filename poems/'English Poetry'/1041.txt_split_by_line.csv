9,I,"From fairest creatures we desire increase,"
10,I,"That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,"
11,I,"But as the riper should by time decease,"
12,I,His tender heir might bear his memory:
13,I,"But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,"
14,I,"Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,"
15,I,"Making a famine where abundance lies,"
16,I,"Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:"
17,I,"Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,"
18,I,"And only herald to the gaudy spring,"
19,I,"Within thine own bud buriest thy content,"
20,I,And tender churl mak’st waste in niggarding:
21,I,"Pity the world, or else this glutton be,"
22,I,"To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee."
23,I,
24,II,II
25,II,
26,II,"When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,"
27,II,"And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,"
28,II,"Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,"
29,II,Will be a tatter’d weed of small worth held:
30,II,"Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,"
31,II,Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
32,II,"To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,"
33,II,"Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise."
34,II,"How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,"
35,II,If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine
36,II,"Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’"
37,II,Proving his beauty by succession thine!
38,II,"This were to be new made when thou art old,"
39,II,And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.
40,II,
41,III,III
42,III,
43,III,Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
44,III,Now is the time that face should form another;
45,III,"Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,"
46,III,"Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother."
47,III,For where is she so fair whose unear’d womb
48,III,Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
49,III,"Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,"
50,III,Of his self-love to stop posterity?
51,III,Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee
52,III,Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
53,III,"So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,"
54,III,Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
55,III,"But if thou live, remember’d not to be,"
56,III,Die single and thine image dies with thee.
57,III,
58,IV,IV
59,IV,
60,IV,"Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend"
61,IV,Upon thyself thy beauty’s legacy?
62,IV,"Nature’s bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,"
63,IV,And being frank she lends to those are free:
64,IV,"Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse"
65,IV,The bounteous largess given thee to give?
66,IV,"Profitless usurer, why dost thou use"
67,IV,"So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?"
68,IV,"For having traffic with thyself alone,"
69,IV,Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive:
70,IV,"Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,"
71,IV,What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
72,IV,"Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,"
73,IV,"Which, used, lives th’ executor to be."
74,IV,
75,V,V
76,V,
77,V,"Those hours, that with gentle work did frame"
78,V,"The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,"
79,V,Will play the tyrants to the very same
80,V,And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
81,V,For never-resting time leads summer on
82,V,"To hideous winter, and confounds him there;"
83,V,"Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,"
84,V,Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:
85,V,"Then were not summer’s distillation left,"
86,V,"A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,"
87,V,"Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,"
88,V,"Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:"
89,V,"But flowers distill’d, though they with winter meet,"
90,V,Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
91,V,
92,V,
93,VI,VI
94,VI,
95,VI,"Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface,"
96,VI,"In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill’d:"
97,VI,Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
98,VI,With beauty’s treasure ere it be self-kill’d.
99,VI,"That use is not forbidden usury,"
100,VI,Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
101,VI,"That’s for thyself to breed another thee,"
102,VI,"Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;"
103,VI,"Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,"
104,VI,If ten of thine ten times refigur’d thee:
105,VI,"Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,"
106,VI,Leaving thee living in posterity?
107,VI,"Be not self-will’d, for thou art much too fair"
108,VI,To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.
109,VI,
110,VII,VII
111,VII,
112,VII,Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
113,VII,"Lifts up his burning head, each under eye"
114,VII,"Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,"
115,VII,Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
116,VII,"And having climb’d the steep-up heavenly hill,"
117,VII,"Resembling strong youth in his middle age,"
118,VII,"Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,"
119,VII,Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
120,VII,"But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,"
121,VII,"Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,"
122,VII,"The eyes, ’fore duteous, now converted are"
123,VII,"From his low tract, and look another way:"
124,VII,"So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:"
125,VII,"Unlook’d, on diest unless thou get a son."
126,VII,
127,VIII,VIII
128,VIII,
129,VIII,"Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?"
130,VIII,"Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:"
131,VIII,"Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,"
132,VIII,Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?
133,VIII,"If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,"
134,VIII,"By unions married, do offend thine ear,"
135,VIII,"They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds"
136,VIII,In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
137,VIII,"Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,"
138,VIII,Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
139,VIII,"Resembling sire and child and happy mother,"
140,VIII,"Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:"
141,VIII,"Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,"
142,VIII,Sings this to thee: ‘Thou single wilt prove none.’
143,VIII,
144,IX,IX
145,IX,
146,IX,"Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,"
147,IX,That thou consum’st thyself in single life?
148,IX,"Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,"
149,IX,The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
150,IX,The world will be thy widow and still weep
151,IX,"That thou no form of thee hast left behind,"
152,IX,When every private widow well may keep
153,IX,"By children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:"
154,IX,Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend
155,IX,"Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;"
156,IX,"But beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,"
157,IX,And kept unused the user so destroys it.
158,IX,No love toward others in that bosom sits
159,IX,That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.
160,IX,
161,X,X
162,X,
163,X,"For shame! deny that thou bear’st love to any,"
164,X,Who for thyself art so unprovident.
165,X,"Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov’d of many,"
166,X,But that thou none lov’st is most evident:
167,X,"For thou art so possess’d with murderous hate,"
168,X,"That ’gainst thyself thou stick’st not to conspire,"
169,X,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
170,X,Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
171,X,"O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:"
172,X,Shall hate be fairer lodg’d than gentle love?
173,X,"Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,"
174,X,Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
175,X,"Make thee another self for love of me,"
176,X,That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
177,X,
178,XI,XI
179,XI,
180,XI,"As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow’st,"
181,XI,"In one of thine, from that which thou departest;"
182,XI,"And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,"
183,XI,"Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,"
184,XI,"Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;"
185,XI,"Without this folly, age, and cold decay:"
186,XI,"If all were minded so, the times should cease"
187,XI,And threescore year would make the world away.
188,XI,"Let those whom nature hath not made for store,"
189,XI,"Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:"
190,XI,"Look, whom she best endow’d, she gave thee more;"
191,XI,Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
192,XI,"She carv’d thee for her seal, and meant thereby,"
193,XI,"Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die."
194,XI,
195,XII,XII
196,XII,
197,XII,"When I do count the clock that tells the time,"
198,XII,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
199,XII,"When I behold the violet past prime,"
200,XII,"And sable curls, all silvered o’er with white;"
201,XII,"When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,"
202,XII,"Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,"
203,XII,"And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves,"
204,XII,"Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,"
205,XII,"Then of thy beauty do I question make,"
206,XII,"That thou among the wastes of time must go,"
207,XII,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
208,XII,And die as fast as they see others grow;
209,XII,And nothing ’gainst Time’s scythe can make defence
210,XII,"Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence."
211,XII,
212,XIII,XIII
213,XIII,
214,XIII,"O! that you were your self; but, love you are"
215,XIII,"No longer yours, than you yourself here live:"
216,XIII,"Against this coming end you should prepare,"
217,XIII,And your sweet semblance to some other give:
218,XIII,So should that beauty which you hold in lease
219,XIII,Find no determination; then you were
220,XIII,"Yourself again, after yourself’s decease,"
221,XIII,When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
222,XIII,"Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,"
223,XIII,"Which husbandry in honour might uphold,"
224,XIII,Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day
225,XIII,And barren rage of death’s eternal cold?
226,XIII,"O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,"
227,XIII,You had a father: let your son say so.
228,XIII,
229,XIV,XIV
230,XIV,
231,XIV,Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;
232,XIV,"And yet methinks I have astronomy,"
233,XIV,"But not to tell of good or evil luck,"
234,XIV,"Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality;"
235,XIV,"Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,"
236,XIV,"Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,"
237,XIV,Or say with princes if it shall go well
238,XIV,By oft predict that I in heaven find:
239,XIV,"But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,"
240,XIV,And constant stars in them I read such art
241,XIV,"As ‘Truth and beauty shall together thrive,"
242,XIV,"If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert’;"
243,XIV,Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
244,XIV,‘Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.’
245,XIV,
246,XV,XV
247,XV,
248,XV,When I consider everything that grows
249,XV,"Holds in perfection but a little moment,"
250,XV,That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
251,XV,Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
252,XV,"When I perceive that men as plants increase,"
253,XV,"Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,"
254,XV,"Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,"
255,XV,And wear their brave state out of memory;
256,XV,Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
257,XV,"Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,"
258,XV,Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
259,XV,"To change your day of youth to sullied night,"
260,XV,"And all in war with Time for love of you,"
261,XV,"As he takes from you, I engraft you new."
262,XV,
263,XVI,XVI
264,XVI,
265,XVI,But wherefore do not you a mightier way
266,XVI,"Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?"
267,XVI,And fortify yourself in your decay
268,XVI,With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
269,XVI,"Now stand you on the top of happy hours,"
270,XVI,"And many maiden gardens, yet unset,"
271,XVI,"With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,"
272,XVI,Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
273,XVI,"So should the lines of life that life repair,"
274,XVI,"Which this, Time’s pencil, or my pupil pen,"
275,XVI,"Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,"
276,XVI,Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
277,XVI,"To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,"
278,XVI,"And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill."
279,XVI,
280,XVII,XVII
281,XVII,
282,XVII,"Who will believe my verse in time to come,"
283,XVII,If it were fill’d with your most high deserts?
284,XVII,Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
285,XVII,"Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts."
286,XVII,"If I could write the beauty of your eyes,"
287,XVII,"And in fresh numbers number all your graces,"
288,XVII,The age to come would say ‘This poet lies;
289,XVII,Such heavenly touches ne’er touch’d earthly faces.’
290,XVII,"So should my papers, yellow’d with their age,"
291,XVII,"Be scorn’d, like old men of less truth than tongue,"
292,XVII,And your true rights be term’d a poet’s rage
293,XVII,And stretched metre of an antique song:
294,XVII,"But were some child of yours alive that time,"
295,XVII,"You should live twice,—in it, and in my rhyme."
296,XVII,
297,XVIII,XVIII
298,XVIII,
299,XVIII,Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
300,XVIII,Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
301,XVIII,"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,"
302,XVIII,And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:
303,XVIII,"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,"
304,XVIII,"And often is his gold complexion dimm’d,"
305,XVIII,"And every fair from fair sometime declines,"
306,XVIII,"By chance, or nature’s changing course untrimm’d:"
307,XVIII,"But thy eternal summer shall not fade,"
308,XVIII,"Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,"
309,XVIII,"Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,"
310,XVIII,"When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,"
311,XVIII,"So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,"
312,XVIII,"So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."
313,XVIII,
314,XIX,XIX
315,XIX,
316,XIX,"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion’s paws,"
317,XIX,And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
318,XIX,"Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws,"
319,XIX,"And burn the long-liv’d phoenix, in her blood;"
320,XIX,"Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,"
321,XIX,"And do whate’er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,"
322,XIX,To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
323,XIX,But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
324,XIX,"O! carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow,"
325,XIX,Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
326,XIX,Him in thy course untainted do allow
327,XIX,For beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.
328,XIX,"Yet do thy worst, old Time; despite thy wrong,"
329,XIX,My love shall in my verse ever live young.
330,XIX,
331,XX,XX
332,XX,
333,XX,"A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,"
334,XX,"Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;"
335,XX,"A woman’s gentle heart, but not acquainted"
336,XX,"With shifting change, as is false women’s fashion:"
337,XX,"An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,"
338,XX,Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
339,XX,"A man in hue all ‘hues’ in his controlling,"
340,XX,Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.
341,XX,And for a woman wert thou first created;
342,XX,"Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,"
343,XX,"And by addition me of thee defeated,"
344,XX,By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
345,XX,"But since she prick’d thee out for women’s pleasure,"
346,XX,Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.
347,XX,
348,XXI,XXI
349,XXI,
350,XXI,"So is it not with me as with that Muse,"
351,XXI,"Stirr’d by a painted beauty to his verse,"
352,XXI,Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
353,XXI,"And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,"
354,XXI,Making a couplement of proud compare.
355,XXI,"With sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems,"
356,XXI,"With April’s first-born flowers, and all things rare,"
357,XXI,That heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems.
358,XXI,"O! let me, true in love, but truly write,"
359,XXI,"And then believe me, my love is as fair"
360,XXI,"As any mother’s child, though not so bright"
361,XXI,As those gold candles fix’d in heaven’s air:
362,XXI,Let them say more that like of hearsay well;
363,XXI,I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
364,XXI,
365,XXII,XXII
366,XXII,
367,XXII,"My glass shall not persuade me I am old,"
368,XXII,So long as youth and thou are of one date;
369,XXII,"But when in thee time’s furrows I behold,"
370,XXII,Then look I death my days should expiate.
371,XXII,"For all that beauty that doth cover thee,"
372,XXII,"Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,"
373,XXII,"Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:"
374,XXII,How can I then be elder than thou art?
375,XXII,"O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary"
376,XXII,"As I, not for myself, but for thee will;"
377,XXII,"Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary"
378,XXII,As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
379,XXII,"Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,"
380,XXII,Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again.
381,XXII,
382,XXIII,XXIII
383,XXIII,
384,XXIII,"As an unperfect actor on the stage,"
385,XXIII,"Who with his fear is put beside his part,"
386,XXIII,"Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,"
387,XXIII,Whose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart;
388,XXIII,"So I, for fear of trust, forget to say"
389,XXIII,"The perfect ceremony of love’s rite,"
390,XXIII,"And in mine own love’s strength seem to decay,"
391,XXIII,O’ercharg’d with burthen of mine own love’s might.
392,XXIII,O! let my looks be then the eloquence
393,XXIII,"And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,"
394,XXIII,"Who plead for love, and look for recompense,"
395,XXIII,More than that tongue that more hath more express’d.
396,XXIII,O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:
397,XXIII,To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.
398,XXIII,
399,XXIV,XXIV
400,XXIV,
401,XXIV,"Mine eye hath play’d the painter and hath stell’d,"
402,XXIV,Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart;
403,XXIV,"My body is the frame wherein ’tis held,"
404,XXIV,And perspective it is best painter’s art.
405,XXIV,"For through the painter must you see his skill,"
406,XXIV,"To find where your true image pictur’d lies,"
407,XXIV,"Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,"
408,XXIV,That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
409,XXIV,Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
410,XXIV,"Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me"
411,XXIV,"Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun"
412,XXIV,"Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;"
413,XXIV,"Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,"
414,XXIV,"They draw but what they see, know not the heart."
415,XXIV,
416,XXV,XXV
417,XXV,
418,XXV,Let those who are in favour with their stars
419,XXV,"Of public honour and proud titles boast,"
420,XXV,"Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars"
421,XXV,Unlook’d for joy in that I honour most.
422,XXV,Great princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread
423,XXV,"But as the marigold at the sun’s eye,"
424,XXV,"And in themselves their pride lies buried,"
425,XXV,For at a frown they in their glory die.
426,XXV,"The painful warrior famoused for fight,"
427,XXV,"After a thousand victories once foil’d,"
428,XXV,"Is from the book of honour razed quite,"
429,XXV,And all the rest forgot for which he toil’d:
430,XXV,"Then happy I, that love and am belov’d,"
431,XXV,Where I may not remove nor be remov’d.
432,XXV,
433,XXVI,XXVI
434,XXVI,
435,XXVI,"Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage"
436,XXVI,"Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,"
437,XXVI,"To thee I send this written embassage,"
438,XXVI,"To witness duty, not to show my wit:"
439,XXVI,"Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine"
440,XXVI,"May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,"
441,XXVI,But that I hope some good conceit of thine
442,XXVI,"In thy soul’s thought, all naked, will bestow it:"
443,XXVI,"Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,"
444,XXVI,"Points on me graciously with fair aspect,"
445,XXVI,"And puts apparel on my tatter’d loving,"
446,XXVI,To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
447,XXVI,Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
448,XXVI,"Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me."
449,XXVI,
450,XXVII,XXVII
451,XXVII,
452,XXVII,"Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,"
453,XXVII,The dear respose for limbs with travel tir’d;
454,XXVII,But then begins a journey in my head
455,XXVII,"To work my mind, when body’s work’s expired:"
456,XXVII,"For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,"
457,XXVII,"Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,"
458,XXVII,"And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,"
459,XXVII,Looking on darkness which the blind do see:
460,XXVII,Save that my soul’s imaginary sight
461,XXVII,"Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,"
462,XXVII,"Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,"
463,XXVII,"Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new."
464,XXVII,"Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,"
465,XXVII,"For thee, and for myself, no quiet find."
466,XXVII,
467,XXVIII,XXVIII
468,XXVIII,
469,XXVIII,"How can I then return in happy plight,"
470,XXVIII,That am debarre’d the benefit of rest?
471,XXVIII,"When day’s oppression is not eas’d by night,"
472,XXVIII,"But day by night and night by day oppress’d,"
473,XXVIII,"And each, though enemies to either’s reign,"
474,XXVIII,"Do in consent shake hands to torture me,"
475,XXVIII,"The one by toil, the other to complain"
476,XXVIII,"How far I toil, still farther off from thee."
477,XXVIII,"I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,"
478,XXVIII,And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
479,XXVIII,"So flatter I the swart-complexion’d night,"
480,XXVIII,When sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even.
481,XXVIII,"But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,"
482,XXVIII,And night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger.
483,XXVIII,
484,XXIX,XXIX
485,XXIX,
486,XXIX,When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes
487,XXIX,"I all alone beweep my outcast state,"
488,XXIX,"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,"
489,XXIX,"And look upon myself, and curse my fate,"
490,XXIX,"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,"
491,XXIX,"Featur’d like him, like him with friends possess’d,"
492,XXIX,"Desiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope,"
493,XXIX,With what I most enjoy contented least;
494,XXIX,"Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,"
495,XXIX,"Haply I think on thee, and then my state,"
496,XXIX,Like to the lark at break of day arising
497,XXIX,"From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;"
498,XXIX,For thy sweet love remember’d such wealth brings
499,XXIX,That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
500,XXIX,
501,XXX,XXX
502,XXX,
503,XXX,When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
504,XXX,"I summon up remembrance of things past,"
505,XXX,"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,"
506,XXX,And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste:
507,XXX,"Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,"
508,XXX,"For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,"
509,XXX,"And weep afresh love’s long since cancell’d woe,"
510,XXX,And moan the expense of many a vanish’d sight:
511,XXX,"Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,"
512,XXX,And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er
513,XXX,"The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,"
514,XXX,Which I new pay as if not paid before.
515,XXX,"But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,"
516,XXX,All losses are restor’d and sorrows end.
517,XXX,
518,XXXI,XXXI
519,XXXI,
520,XXXI,"Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,"
521,XXXI,Which I by lacking have supposed dead;
522,XXXI,"And there reigns Love, and all Love’s loving parts,"
523,XXXI,And all those friends which I thought buried.
524,XXXI,How many a holy and obsequious tear
525,XXXI,"Hath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye,"
526,XXXI,"As interest of the dead, which now appear"
527,XXXI,But things remov’d that hidden in thee lie!
528,XXXI,"Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,"
529,XXXI,"Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,"
530,XXXI,"Who all their parts of me to thee did give,"
531,XXXI,That due of many now is thine alone:
532,XXXI,"Their images I lov’d, I view in thee,"
533,XXXI,"And thou, all they, hast all the all of me."
534,XXXI,
535,XXXII,XXXII
536,XXXII,
537,XXXII,"If thou survive my well-contented day,"
538,XXXII,When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover
539,XXXII,And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
540,XXXII,"These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,"
541,XXXII,"Compare them with the bett’ring of the time,"
542,XXXII,"And though they be outstripp’d by every pen,"
543,XXXII,"Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,"
544,XXXII,Exceeded by the height of happier men.
545,XXXII,O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
546,XXXII,"‘Had my friend’s Muse grown with this growing age,"
547,XXXII,"A dearer birth than this his love had brought,"
548,XXXII,To march in ranks of better equipage:
549,XXXII,"But since he died and poets better prove,"
550,XXXII,"Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love’."
551,XXXII,
552,XXXIII,XXXIII
553,XXXIII,
554,XXXIII,Full many a glorious morning have I seen
555,XXXIII,"Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,"
556,XXXIII,"Kissing with golden face the meadows green,"
557,XXXIII,Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
558,XXXIII,Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
559,XXXIII,"With ugly rack on his celestial face,"
560,XXXIII,"And from the forlorn world his visage hide,"
561,XXXIII,Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
562,XXXIII,"Even so my sun one early morn did shine,"
563,XXXIII,With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
564,XXXIII,"But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,"
565,XXXIII,The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now.
566,XXXIII,Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
567,XXXIII,Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.
568,XXXIII,
569,XXXIV,XXXIV
570,XXXIV,
571,XXXIV,"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,"
572,XXXIV,"And make me travel forth without my cloak,"
573,XXXIV,"To let base clouds o’ertake me in my way,"
574,XXXIV,Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
575,XXXIV,"’Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,"
576,XXXIV,"To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,"
577,XXXIV,"For no man well of such a salve can speak,"
578,XXXIV,"That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:"
579,XXXIV,Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
580,XXXIV,"Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:"
581,XXXIV,The offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief
582,XXXIV,To him that bears the strong offence’s cross.
583,XXXIV,"Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,"
584,XXXIV,And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.
585,XXXIV,
586,XXXV,XXXV
587,XXXV,
588,XXXV,No more be griev’d at that which thou hast done:
589,XXXV,"Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:"
590,XXXV,"Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,"
591,XXXV,And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
592,XXXV,"All men make faults, and even I in this,"
593,XXXV,"Authorizing thy trespass with compare,"
594,XXXV,"Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,"
595,XXXV,Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
596,XXXV,For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense;
597,XXXV,"Thy adverse party is thy advocate,"
598,XXXV,And ’gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
599,XXXV,"Such civil war is in my love and hate,"
600,XXXV,"That I an accessary needs must be,"
601,XXXV,To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
602,XXXV,
603,XXXVI,XXXVI
604,XXXVI,
605,XXXVI,"Let me confess that we two must be twain,"
606,XXXVI,Although our undivided loves are one:
607,XXXVI,"So shall those blots that do with me remain,"
608,XXXVI,"Without thy help, by me be borne alone."
609,XXXVI,"In our two loves there is but one respect,"
610,XXXVI,"Though in our lives a separable spite,"
611,XXXVI,"Which though it alter not love’s sole effect,"
612,XXXVI,Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight.
613,XXXVI,"I may not evermore acknowledge thee,"
614,XXXVI,"Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,"
615,XXXVI,"Nor thou with public kindness honour me,"
616,XXXVI,Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
617,XXXVI,"But do not so, I love thee in such sort,"
618,XXXVI,"As thou being mine, mine is thy good report."
619,XXXVI,
620,XXXVII,XXXVII
621,XXXVII,
622,XXXVII,As a decrepit father takes delight
623,XXXVII,"To see his active child do deeds of youth,"
624,XXXVII,"So I, made lame by Fortune’s dearest spite,"
625,XXXVII,Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;
626,XXXVII,"For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,"
627,XXXVII,"Or any of these all, or all, or more,"
628,XXXVII,"Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,"
629,XXXVII,"I make my love engrafted, to this store:"
630,XXXVII,"So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis’d,"
631,XXXVII,Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
632,XXXVII,"That I in thy abundance am suffic’d,"
633,XXXVII,And by a part of all thy glory live.
634,XXXVII,"Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:"
635,XXXVII,This wish I have; then ten times happy me!
636,XXXVII,
637,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
638,XXXVIII,
639,XXXVIII,"How can my Muse want subject to invent,"
640,XXXVIII,"While thou dost breathe, that pour’st into my verse"
641,XXXVIII,"Thine own sweet argument, too excellent"
642,XXXVIII,For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
643,XXXVIII,"O! give thyself the thanks, if aught in me"
644,XXXVIII,Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
645,XXXVIII,"For who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee,"
646,XXXVIII,When thou thyself dost give invention light?
647,XXXVIII,"Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth"
648,XXXVIII,Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
649,XXXVIII,"And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth"
650,XXXVIII,Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
651,XXXVIII,"If my slight Muse do please these curious days,"
652,XXXVIII,"The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise."
653,XXXVIII,
654,XXXIX,XXXIX
655,XXXIX,
656,XXXIX,"O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,"
657,XXXIX,When thou art all the better part of me?
658,XXXIX,What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
659,XXXIX,And what is’t but mine own when I praise thee?
660,XXXIX,"Even for this, let us divided live,"
661,XXXIX,"And our dear love lose name of single one,"
662,XXXIX,That by this separation I may give
663,XXXIX,That due to thee which thou deserv’st alone.
664,XXXIX,"O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,"
665,XXXIX,"Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,"
666,XXXIX,"To entertain the time with thoughts of love,"
667,XXXIX,"Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,"
668,XXXIX,"And that thou teachest how to make one twain,"
669,XXXIX,By praising him here who doth hence remain.
670,XXXIX,
671,XL,XL
672,XL,
673,XL,"Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;"
674,XL,What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
675,XL,"No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;"
676,XL,"All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more."
677,XL,"Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,"
678,XL,"I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;"
679,XL,"But yet be blam’d, if thou thyself deceivest"
680,XL,By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
681,XL,"I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,"
682,XL,Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
683,XL,"And yet, love knows it is a greater grief"
684,XL,"To bear love’s wrong, than hate’s known injury."
685,XL,"Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,"
686,XL,Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.
687,XL,
688,XLI,XLI
689,XLI,
690,XLI,"Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,"
691,XLI,"When I am sometime absent from thy heart,"
692,XLI,"Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,"
693,XLI,For still temptation follows where thou art.
694,XLI,"Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,"
695,XLI,"Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assail’d;"
696,XLI,"And when a woman woos, what woman’s son"
697,XLI,Will sourly leave her till he have prevail’d?
698,XLI,"Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,"
699,XLI,"And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,"
700,XLI,Who lead thee in their riot even there
701,XLI,Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:
702,XLI,"Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,"
703,XLI,Thine by thy beauty being false to me.
704,XLI,
705,XLII,XLII
706,XLII,
707,XLII,"That thou hast her it is not all my grief,"
708,XLII,And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
709,XLII,"That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,"
710,XLII,A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
711,XLII,Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:
712,XLII,"Thou dost love her, because thou know’st I love her;"
713,XLII,"And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,"
714,XLII,Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
715,XLII,"If I lose thee, my loss is my love’s gain,"
716,XLII,"And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;"
717,XLII,"Both find each other, and I lose both twain,"
718,XLII,And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
719,XLII,But here’s the joy; my friend and I are one;
720,XLII,Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.
721,XLII,
722,XLIII,XLIII
723,XLIII,
724,XLIII,"When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,"
725,XLIII,For all the day they view things unrespected;
726,XLIII,"But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,"
727,XLIII,"And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed."
728,XLIII,"Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,"
729,XLIII,How would thy shadow’s form form happy show
730,XLIII,"To the clear day with thy much clearer light,"
731,XLIII,When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
732,XLIII,"How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made"
733,XLIII,"By looking on thee in the living day,"
734,XLIII,When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
735,XLIII,Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
736,XLIII,"All days are nights to see till I see thee,"
737,XLIII,And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
738,XLIII,
739,XLIV,XLIV
740,XLIV,
741,XLIV,"If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,"
742,XLIV,Injurious distance should not stop my way;
743,XLIV,"For then despite of space I would be brought,"
744,XLIV,"From limits far remote, where thou dost stay."
745,XLIV,No matter then although my foot did stand
746,XLIV,Upon the farthest earth remov’d from thee;
747,XLIV,"For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,"
748,XLIV,As soon as think the place where he would be.
749,XLIV,"But, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,"
750,XLIV,"To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,"
751,XLIV,"But that so much of earth and water wrought,"
752,XLIV,I must attend time’s leisure with my moan;
753,XLIV,Receiving nought by elements so slow
754,XLIV,"But heavy tears, badges of either’s woe."
755,XLIV,
756,XLV,XLV
757,XLV,
758,XLV,"The other two, slight air, and purging fire"
759,XLV,"Are both with thee, wherever I abide;"
760,XLV,"The first my thought, the other my desire,"
761,XLV,These present-absent with swift motion slide.
762,XLV,For when these quicker elements are gone
763,XLV,"In tender embassy of love to thee,"
764,XLV,"My life, being made of four, with two alone"
765,XLV,"Sinks down to death, oppress’d with melancholy;"
766,XLV,Until life’s composition be recur’d
767,XLV,"By those swift messengers return’d from thee,"
768,XLV,"Who even but now come back again, assur’d,"
769,XLV,"Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:"
770,XLV,"This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,"
771,XLV,"I send them back again, and straight grow sad."
772,XLV,
773,XLVI,XLVI
774,XLVI,
775,XLVI,"Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,"
776,XLVI,How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
777,XLVI,"Mine eye my heart thy picture’s sight would bar,"
778,XLVI,My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
779,XLVI,"My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,"
780,XLVI,A closet never pierced with crystal eyes;
781,XLVI,"But the defendant doth that plea deny,"
782,XLVI,And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
783,XLVI,To side this title is impannelled
784,XLVI,"A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;"
785,XLVI,And by their verdict is determined
786,XLVI,"The clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part:"
787,XLVI,"As thus; mine eye’s due is thy outward part,"
788,XLVI,"And my heart’s right, thy inward love of heart."
789,XLVI,
790,XLVII,XLVII
791,XLVII,
792,XLVII,"Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,"
793,XLVII,And each doth good turns now unto the other:
794,XLVII,"When that mine eye is famish’d for a look,"
795,XLVII,"Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,"
796,XLVII,"With my love’s picture then my eye doth feast,"
797,XLVII,And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
798,XLVII,"Another time mine eye is my heart’s guest,"
799,XLVII,And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
800,XLVII,"So, either by thy picture or my love,"
801,XLVII,"Thyself away, art present still with me;"
802,XLVII,"For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,"
803,XLVII,"And I am still with them, and they with thee;"
804,XLVII,"Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight"
805,XLVII,"Awakes my heart, to heart’s and eye’s delight."
806,XLVII,
807,XLVIII,XLVIII
808,XLVIII,
809,XLVIII,"How careful was I when I took my way,"
810,XLVIII,"Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,"
811,XLVIII,That to my use it might unused stay
812,XLVIII,"From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!"
813,XLVIII,"But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,"
814,XLVIII,"Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,"
815,XLVIII,"Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,"
816,XLVIII,Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
817,XLVIII,"Thee have I not lock’d up in any chest,"
818,XLVIII,"Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,"
819,XLVIII,"Within the gentle closure of my breast,"
820,XLVIII,From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
821,XLVIII,"And even thence thou wilt be stol’n I fear,"
822,XLVIII,For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
823,XLVIII,
824,XLIX,XLIX
825,XLIX,
826,XLIX,"Against that time, if ever that time come,"
827,XLIX,"When I shall see thee frown on my defects,"
828,XLIX,"When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,"
829,XLIX,Call’d to that audit by advis’d respects;
830,XLIX,"Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,"
831,XLIX,"And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,"
832,XLIX,"When love, converted from the thing it was,"
833,XLIX,Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
834,XLIX,"Against that time do I ensconce me here,"
835,XLIX,"Within the knowledge of mine own desert,"
836,XLIX,"And this my hand, against my self uprear,"
837,XLIX,To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
838,XLIX,"To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,"
839,XLIX,Since why to love I can allege no cause.
840,XLIX,
841,L,L
842,L,
843,L,"How heavy do I journey on the way,"
844,L,"When what I seek, my weary travel’s end,"
845,L,"Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,"
846,L,‘Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!’
847,L,"The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,"
848,L,"Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,"
849,L,As if by some instinct the wretch did know
850,L,"His rider lov’d not speed, being made from thee:"
851,L,"The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,"
852,L,"That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,"
853,L,"Which heavily he answers with a groan,"
854,L,More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
855,L,"For that same groan doth put this in my mind,"
856,L,"My grief lies onward, and my joy behind."
857,L,
858,LI,LI
859,LI,
860,LI,Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
861,LI,Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
862,LI,From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
863,LI,"Till I return, of posting is no need."
864,LI,"O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,"
865,LI,When swift extremity can seem but slow?
866,LI,"Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,"
867,LI,"In winged speed no motion shall I know,"
868,LI,Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
869,LI,"Therefore desire, of perfect’st love being made,"
870,LI,"Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race,"
871,LI,"But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade:"
872,LI,"‘Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,"
873,LI,"Towards thee I’ll run, and give him leave to go.’"
874,LI,
875,LII,LII
876,LII,
877,LII,"So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,"

879,LII,"The which he will not every hour survey,"
880,LII,For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
881,LII,"Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,"
882,LII,"Since, seldom coming in that long year set,"
883,LII,"Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,"
884,LII,Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
885,LII,"So is the time that keeps you as my chest,"
886,LII,"Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,"
887,LII,"To make some special instant special-blest,"
888,LII,By new unfolding his imprison’d pride.
889,LII,"Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,"
890,LII,"Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope."
891,LII,
892,LIII,LIII
893,LIII,
894,LIII,"What is your substance, whereof are you made,"

897,LIII,"And you but one, can every shadow lend."
898,LIII,"Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit"
899,LIII,Is poorly imitated after you;
900,LIII,"On Helen’s cheek all art of beauty set,"
901,LIII,And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
902,LIII,"Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,"

911,LIV,O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
912,LIV,By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
913,LIV,"The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem"
914,LIV,"For that sweet odour, which doth in it live."
915,LIV,The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
916,LIV,As the perfumed tincture of the roses.
917,LIV,"Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly"
918,LIV,When summer’s breath their masked buds discloses:
919,LIV,"But, for their virtue only is their show,"
920,LIV,"They live unwoo’d, and unrespected fade;"
921,LIV,Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
922,LIV,"Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:"

933,LV,"And broils root out the work of masonry,"
934,LV,"Nor Mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn"
935,LV,The living record of your memory.
936,LV,"’Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity"

938,LV,Even in the eyes of all posterity

951,LVI,"To-morrow see again, and do not kill"
952,LVI,"The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness."

954,LVI,"Which parts the shore, where two contracted new"
955,LVI,"Come daily to the banks, that when they see"

984,LVIII,The imprison’d absence of your liberty;

986,LVIII,Without accusing you of injury.
987,LVIII,"Be where you list, your charter is so strong"

1021,LX,Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
1022,LX,"And delves the parallels in beauty’s brow,"
1023,LX,"Feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth,"

1036,LXI,"To find out shames and idle hours in me,"
1037,LXI,The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?

1039,LXI,It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
1040,LXI,"Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,"

1069,LXIII,And all those beauties whereof now he’s king
1070,LXIII,"Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,"
1071,LXIII,Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
1072,LXIII,For such a time do I now fortify
1073,LXIII,"Against confounding age’s cruel knife,"
1074,LXIII,That he shall never cut from memory
1075,LXIII,"My sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life:"

1079,LXIV,LXIV
1080,LXIV,
1081,LXIV,When I have seen by Time’s fell hand defac’d
1082,LXIV,The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;
1083,LXIV,"When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz’d,"
1084,LXIV,And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
1085,LXIV,When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
1086,LXIV,"Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,"
1087,LXIV,"And the firm soil win of the watery main,"
1088,LXIV,"Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;"
1089,LXIV,"When I have seen such interchange of state,"
1090,LXIV,"Or state itself confounded, to decay;"
1091,LXIV,Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate:
1092,LXIV,That Time will come and take my love away.
1093,LXIV,This thought is as a death which cannot choose

1103,LXV,"Against the wrackful siege of battering days,"
1104,LXV,"When rocks impregnable are not so stout,"
1105,LXV,Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?
1106,LXV,"O fearful meditation! where, alack,"
1107,LXV,Shall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid?
1108,LXV,Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
1109,LXV,Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
1110,LXV,"O! none, unless this miracle have might,"
1111,LXV,That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

1113,LXVI,LXVI
1114,LXVI,
1115,LXVI,"Tired with all these, for restful death I cry:"

1118,LXVI,"And purest faith unhappily forsworn,"
1119,LXVI,"And gilded honour shamefully misplac’d,"
1120,LXVI,"And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,"
1121,LXVI,"And right perfection wrongfully disgrac’d,"
1122,LXVI,And strength by limping sway disabled
1123,LXVI,"And art made tongue-tied by authority,"
1124,LXVI,"And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,"
1125,LXVI,"And simple truth miscall’d simplicity,"
1126,LXVI,And captive good attending captain ill:

1134,LXVII,"That sin by him advantage should achieve,"
1135,LXVII,And lace itself with his society?
1136,LXVII,"Why should false painting imitate his cheek,"
1137,LXVII,And steel dead seeming of his living hue?
1138,LXVII,Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
1139,LXVII,"Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?"
1140,LXVII,"Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,"
1141,LXVII,Beggar’d of blood to blush through lively veins?
1142,LXVII,"For she hath no exchequer now but his,"
1143,LXVII,"And proud of many, lives upon his gains."
1144,LXVII,"O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had"

1152,LXVIII,Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
1153,LXVIII,"Before the golden tresses of the dead,"
1154,LXVIII,"The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,"
1155,LXVIII,To live a second life on second head;
1156,LXVIII,Ere beauty’s dead fleece made another gay:
1157,LXVIII,"In him those holy antique hours are seen,"
1158,LXVIII,"Without all ornament, itself and true,"
1159,LXVIII,"Making no summer of another’s green,"
1160,LXVIII,Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
1161,LXVIII,"And him as for a map doth Nature store,"
1162,LXVIII,To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
1163,LXVIII,
1164,LXIX,LXIX
1165,LXIX,
1166,LXIX,Those parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view
1167,LXIX,Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
1168,LXIX,"All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,"
1169,LXIX,"Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend."
1170,LXIX,Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown’d;
1171,LXIX,"But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,"
1172,LXIX,In other accents do this praise confound
1173,LXIX,By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
1174,LXIX,"They look into the beauty of thy mind,"
1175,LXIX,And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;
1176,LXIX,"Then churls their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,"
1177,LXIX,To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
1178,LXIX,"But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,"
1179,LXIX,"The soil is this, that thou dost common grow."
1180,LXIX,
1181,LXX,LXX
1182,LXX,
1183,LXX,"That thou art blam’d shall not be thy defect,"
1184,LXX,For slander’s mark was ever yet the fair;
1185,LXX,"The ornament of beauty is suspect,"
1186,LXX,A crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air.
1187,LXX,"So thou be good, slander doth but approve"
1188,LXX,Thy worth the greater being woo’d of time;
1189,LXX,"For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,"
1190,LXX,And thou present’st a pure unstained prime.
1191,LXX,Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
1192,LXX,"Either not assail’d, or victor being charg’d;"
1193,LXX,"Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,"
1194,LXX,"To tie up envy, evermore enlarg’d,"
1195,LXX,"If some suspect of ill mask’d not thy show,"
1196,LXX,Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
1197,LXX,
1198,LXXI,LXXI
1199,LXXI,
1200,LXXI,No longer mourn for me when I am dead
1201,LXXI,Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
1202,LXXI,Give warning to the world that I am fled
1203,LXXI,From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
1204,LXXI,"Nay, if you read this line, remember not"
1205,LXXI,"The hand that writ it, for I love you so,"
1206,LXXI,"That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,"
1207,LXXI,If thinking on me then should make you woe.
1208,LXXI,"O if, I say, you look upon this verse,"
1209,LXXI,"When I perhaps compounded am with clay,"
1210,LXXI,Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
1211,LXXI,But let your love even with my life decay;
1212,LXXI,"Lest the wise world should look into your moan,"
1213,LXXI,And mock you with me after I am gone.
1214,LXXI,
1215,LXXII,LXXII
1216,LXXII,
1217,LXXII,O! lest the world should task you to recite
1218,LXXII,"What merit lived in me, that you should love"
1219,LXXII,"After my death, dear love, forget me quite,"
1220,LXXII,For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
1221,LXXII,"Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,"
1222,LXXII,"To do more for me than mine own desert,"
1223,LXXII,And hang more praise upon deceased I
1224,LXXII,Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
1225,LXXII,O! lest your true love may seem false in this
1226,LXXII,"That you for love speak well of me untrue,"
1227,LXXII,"My name be buried where my body is,"
1228,LXXII,And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
1229,LXXII,"For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,"
1230,LXXII,"And so should you, to love things nothing worth."
1231,LXXII,
1232,LXXIII,LXXIII
1233,LXXIII,
1234,LXXIII,That time of year thou mayst in me behold
1235,LXXIII,"When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang"
1236,LXXIII,"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,"
1237,LXXIII,"Bare ruin’d choirs, where late the sweet birds sang."
1238,LXXIII,In me thou see’st the twilight of such day
1239,LXXIII,As after sunset fadeth in the west;
1240,LXXIII,"Which by and by black night doth take away,"
1241,LXXIII,"Death’s second self, that seals up all in rest."
1242,LXXIII,"In me thou see’st the glowing of such fire,"
1243,LXXIII,"That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,"
1244,LXXIII,"As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,"
1245,LXXIII,Consum’d with that which it was nourish’d by.
1246,LXXIII,"This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,"
1247,LXXIII,"To love that well, which thou must leave ere long."
1248,LXXIII,
1249,LXXIV,LXXIV
1250,LXXIV,
1251,LXXIV,But be contented: when that fell arrest
1252,LXXIV,"Without all bail shall carry me away,"
1253,LXXIV,"My life hath in this line some interest,"
1254,LXXIV,Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
1255,LXXIV,"When thou reviewest this, thou dost review"
1256,LXXIV,The very part was consecrate to thee:
1257,LXXIV,"The earth can have but earth, which is his due;"
1258,LXXIV,"My spirit is thine, the better part of me:"
1259,LXXIV,"So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,"
1260,LXXIV,"The prey of worms, my body being dead;"
1261,LXXIV,"The coward conquest of a wretch’s knife,"
1262,LXXIV,Too base of thee to be remembered.
1263,LXXIV,"The worth of that is that which it contains,"
1264,LXXIV,"And that is this, and this with thee remains."
1265,LXXIV,
1266,LXXV,LXXV
1267,LXXV,
1268,LXXV,"So are you to my thoughts as food to life,"
1269,LXXV,Or as sweet-season’d showers are to the ground;
1270,LXXV,And for the peace of you I hold such strife
1271,LXXV,As ’twixt a miser and his wealth is found.
1272,LXXV,"Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon"
1273,LXXV,Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;
1274,LXXV,"Now counting best to be with you alone,"
1275,LXXV,Then better’d that the world may see my pleasure:
1276,LXXV,"Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,"
1277,LXXV,And by and by clean starved for a look;
1278,LXXV,"Possessing or pursuing no delight,"
1279,LXXV,"Save what is had, or must from you be took."
1280,LXXV,"Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,"
1281,LXXV,"Or gluttoning on all, or all away."
1282,LXXV,
1283,LXXVI,LXXVI
1284,LXXVI,
1285,LXXVI,"Why is my verse so barren of new pride,"
1286,LXXVI,So far from variation or quick change?
1287,LXXVI,Why with the time do I not glance aside
1288,LXXVI,"To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?"
1289,LXXVI,"Why write I still all one, ever the same,"
1290,LXXVI,"And keep invention in a noted weed,"
1291,LXXVI,"That every word doth almost tell my name,"
1292,LXXVI,"Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?"
1293,LXXVI,"O! know sweet love I always write of you,"
1294,LXXVI,And you and love are still my argument;
1295,LXXVI,"So all my best is dressing old words new,"
1296,LXXVI,Spending again what is already spent:
1297,LXXVI,"For as the sun is daily new and old,"
1298,LXXVI,So is my love still telling what is told.

1300,LXXVII,LXXVII
1301,LXXVII,
1302,LXXVII,"Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,"
1303,LXXVII,Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
1304,LXXVII,"These vacant leaves thy mind’s imprint will bear,"
1305,LXXVII,"And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste."
1306,LXXVII,The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
1307,LXXVII,Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
1308,LXXVII,Thou by thy dial’s shady stealth mayst know
1309,LXXVII,Time’s thievish progress to eternity.
1310,LXXVII,"Look! what thy memory cannot contain,"
1311,LXXVII,"Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find"
1312,LXXVII,"Those children nursed, deliver’d from thy brain,"
1313,LXXVII,To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
1314,LXXVII,"These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,"
1315,LXXVII,Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.

1317,LXXVIII,LXXVIII
1318,LXXVIII,
1319,LXXVIII,"So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,"
1320,LXXVIII,And found such fair assistance in my verse
1321,LXXVIII,As every alien pen hath got my use
1322,LXXVIII,And under thee their poesy disperse.
1323,LXXVIII,"Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing"
1324,LXXVIII,"And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,"
1325,LXXVIII,Have added feathers to the learned’s wing

1327,LXXVIII,"Yet be most proud of that which I compile,"
1328,LXXVIII,"Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:"
1329,LXXVIII,"In others’ works thou dost but mend the style,"
1330,LXXVIII,And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;

1339,LXXIX,And my sick Muse doth give an other place.
1340,LXXIX,"I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument"
1341,LXXIX,Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;
1342,LXXIX,Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
1343,LXXIX,"He robs thee of, and pays it thee again."
1344,LXXIX,"He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word"
1345,LXXIX,"From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,"
1346,LXXIX,And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
1347,LXXIX,"No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live."
1348,LXXIX,"Then thank him not for that which he doth say,"
1349,LXXIX,"Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay."

1354,LXXX,"Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,"
1355,LXXX,"And in the praise thereof spends all his might,"
1356,LXXX,To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!
1357,LXXX,"But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,"
1358,LXXX,"The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,"
1359,LXXX,"My saucy bark, inferior far to his,"
1360,LXXX,On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
1361,LXXX,"Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,"
1362,LXXX,Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
1363,LXXX,"Or, being wrack’d, I am a worthless boat,"
1364,LXXX,"He of tall building, and of goodly pride:"
1365,LXXX,"Then if he thrive and I be cast away,"

1376,LXXXI,"The earth can yield me but a common grave,"
1377,LXXXI,When you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie.
1378,LXXXI,"Your monument shall be my gentle verse,"
1379,LXXXI,Which eyes not yet created shall o’er-read;
1380,LXXXI,"And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,"

1389,LXXXII,The dedicated words which writers use
1390,LXXXII,"Of their fair subject, blessing every book."
1391,LXXXII,"Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,"
1392,LXXXII,Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;
1393,LXXXII,And therefore art enforced to seek anew
1394,LXXXII,Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
1395,LXXXII,"And do so, love; yet when they have devis’d,"
1396,LXXXII,"What strained touches rhetoric can lend,"
1397,LXXXII,"Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz’d"
1398,LXXXII,"In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;"

1407,LXXXIII,That barren tender of a poet’s debt:
1408,LXXXIII,"And therefore have I slept in your report,"
1409,LXXXIII,"That you yourself, being extant, well might show"
1410,LXXXIII,"How far a modern quill doth come too short,"
1411,LXXXIII,"Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow."
1412,LXXXIII,"This silence for my sin you did impute,"
1413,LXXXIII,Which shall be most my glory being dumb;
1414,LXXXIII,"For I impair not beauty being mute,"
1415,LXXXIII,"When others would give life, and bring a tomb."
1416,LXXXIII,There lives more life in one of your fair eyes

1424,LXXXIV,Which should example where your equal grew.
1425,LXXXIV,Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
1426,LXXXIV,That to his subject lends not some small glory;
1427,LXXXIV,"But he that writes of you, if he can tell"
1428,LXXXIV,"That you are you, so dignifies his story,"
1429,LXXXIV,"Let him but copy what in you is writ,"
1430,LXXXIV,"Not making worse what nature made so clear,"
1431,LXXXIV,"And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,"
1432,LXXXIV,Making his style admired every where.
1433,LXXXIV,"You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,"
1434,LXXXIV,"Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse."

1441,LXXXV,And precious phrase by all the Muses fil’d.
1442,LXXXV,"I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,"
1443,LXXXV,And like unlettered clerk still cry ‘Amen’
1444,LXXXV,"To every hymn that able spirit affords,"
1445,LXXXV,In polish’d form of well-refined pen.
1446,LXXXV,"Hearing you praised, I say ‘’tis so, ’tis true,’"
1447,LXXXV,And to the most of praise add something more;
1448,LXXXV,"But that is in my thought, whose love to you,"
1449,LXXXV,"Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before."
1450,LXXXV,"Then others, for the breath of words respect,"
1451,LXXXV,"Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect."

1456,LXXXVI,"Bound for the prize of all too precious you,"
1457,LXXXVI,"That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,"
1458,LXXXVI,Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
1459,LXXXVI,"Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,"
1460,LXXXVI,"Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?"
1461,LXXXVI,"No, neither he, nor his compeers by night"
1462,LXXXVI,"Giving him aid, my verse astonished."
1463,LXXXVI,"He, nor that affable familiar ghost"
1464,LXXXVI,"Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,"
1465,LXXXVI,As victors of my silence cannot boast;
1466,LXXXVI,I was not sick of any fear from thence:
1467,LXXXVI,"But when your countenance fill’d up his line,"
1468,LXXXVI,Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.

1472,LXXXVII,"Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,"
1473,LXXXVII,"And like enough thou know’st thy estimate,"
1474,LXXXVII,The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
1475,LXXXVII,My bonds in thee are all determinate.
1476,LXXXVII,For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
1477,LXXXVII,And for that riches where is my deserving?
1478,LXXXVII,"The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,"
1479,LXXXVII,And so my patent back again is swerving.
1480,LXXXVII,"Thyself thou gav’st, thy own worth then not knowing,"
1481,LXXXVII,"Or me to whom thou gav’st it, else mistaking;"
1482,LXXXVII,"So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,"
1483,LXXXVII,"Comes home again, on better judgement making."
1484,LXXXVII,"Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,"
1485,LXXXVII,"In sleep a king, but waking no such matter."

1492,LXXXVIII,"And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn."
1493,LXXXVIII,"With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,"
1494,LXXXVIII,Upon thy part I can set down a story
1495,LXXXVIII,"Of faults conceal’d, wherein I am attainted;"
1496,LXXXVIII,That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
1497,LXXXVIII,And I by this will be a gainer too;
1498,LXXXVIII,"For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,"
1499,LXXXVIII,"The injuries that to myself I do,"
1500,LXXXVIII,"Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me."

1514,LXXXIX,Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue
1515,LXXXIX,"Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,"
1516,LXXXIX,"Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,"

1733,CII,When I was wont to greet it with my lays;
1734,CII,"As Philomel in summer’s front doth sing,"
1735,CII,And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
1736,CII,Not that the summer is less pleasant now
1737,CII,"Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,"
1738,CII,"But that wild music burthens every bough,"
1739,CII,And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
1740,CII,"Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:"
1741,CII,Because I would not dull you with my song.

1745,CIII,"Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,"
1746,CIII,"That having such a scope to show her pride,"
1747,CIII,"The argument, all bare, is of more worth"
1748,CIII,Than when it hath my added praise beside!
1749,CIII,"O! blame me not, if I no more can write!"
1750,CIII,"Look in your glass, and there appears a face"
1751,CIII,"That over-goes my blunt invention quite,"
1752,CIII,"Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace."
1753,CIII,"Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,"
1754,CIII,To mar the subject that before was well?
1755,CIII,For to no other pass my verses tend
1756,CIII,Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
1757,CIII,"And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,"
1758,CIII,Your own glass shows you when you look in it.

1762,CIV,"To me, fair friend, you never can be old,"
1763,CIV,"For as you were when first your eye I ey’d,"
1764,CIV,"Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,"
1765,CIV,"Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride,"
1766,CIV,"Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn’d,"
1767,CIV,"In process of the seasons have I seen,"
1768,CIV,"Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn’d,"
1769,CIV,"Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green."
1770,CIV,"Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,"
1771,CIV,"Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv’d;"
1772,CIV,"So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,"
1773,CIV,"Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv’d:"
1774,CIV,"For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:"
1775,CIV,Ere you were born was beauty’s summer dead.

1779,CV,"Let not my love be call’d idolatry,"
1780,CV,"Nor my beloved as an idol show,"

1782,CV,"To one, of one, still such, and ever so."
1783,CV,"Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,"
1784,CV,Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
1785,CV,"Therefore my verse to constancy confin’d,"
1786,CV,"One thing expressing, leaves out difference."
1787,CV,"‘Fair, kind, and true,’ is all my argument,"
1788,CV,"‘Fair, kind, and true,’ varying to other words;"
1789,CV,"And in this change is my invention spent,"
1790,CV,"Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords."
1791,CV,"Fair, kind, and true, have often liv’d alone,"
1792,CV,"Which three till now, never kept seat in one."

1794,CVI,CVI
1795,CVI,
1796,CVI,When in the chronicle of wasted time
1797,CVI,"I see descriptions of the fairest wights,"
1798,CVI,"And beauty making beautiful old rime,"
1799,CVI,"In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,"
1800,CVI,"Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty’s best,"
1801,CVI,"Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,"
1802,CVI,I see their antique pen would have express’d
1803,CVI,Even such a beauty as you master now.
1804,CVI,So all their praises are but prophecies
1805,CVI,"Of this our time, all you prefiguring;"
1806,CVI,"And for they looked but with divining eyes,"
1807,CVI,They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
1808,CVI,"For we, which now behold these present days,"
1809,CVI,"Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise."

1812,CVII,
1813,CVII,"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul"
1814,CVII,"Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,"
1815,CVII,"Can yet the lease of my true love control,"
1816,CVII,Supposed as forfeit to a confin’d doom.
1817,CVII,"The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur’d,"
1818,CVII,And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
1819,CVII,"Incertainties now crown themselves assur’d,"
1820,CVII,And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
1821,CVII,"Now with the drops of this most balmy time,"
1822,CVII,"My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,"
1823,CVII,"Since, spite of him, I’ll live in this poor rime,"
1824,CVII,While he insults o’er dull and speechless tribes:
1825,CVII,"And thou in this shalt find thy monument,"
1826,CVII,When tyrants’ crests and tombs of brass are spent.

1832,CVIII,"What’s new to speak, what now to register,"
1833,CVIII,"That may express my love, or thy dear merit?"
1834,CVIII,"Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,"
1835,CVIII,I must each day say o’er the very same;
1836,CVIII,"Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,"
1837,CVIII,Even as when first I hallow’d thy fair name.
1838,CVIII,"So that eternal love in love’s fresh case,"
1839,CVIII,"Weighs not the dust and injury of age,"
1840,CVIII,"Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,"
1841,CVIII,But makes antiquity for aye his page;
1842,CVIII,"Finding the first conceit of love there bred,"
1843,CVIII,Where time and outward form would show it dead.

1850,CIX,As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
1851,CIX,"That is my home of love: if I have rang’d,"
1852,CIX,"Like him that travels, I return again;"
1853,CIX,"Just to the time, not with the time exchang’d,"
1854,CIX,So that myself bring water for my stain.
1855,CIX,"Never believe though in my nature reign’d,"
1856,CIX,"All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,"
1857,CIX,"That it could so preposterously be stain’d,"
1858,CIX,To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;

1867,CX,Made old offences of affections new;
1868,CX,"Most true it is, that I have look’d on truth"
1869,CX,"Askance and strangely; but, by all above,"
1870,CX,"These blenches gave my heart another youth,"
1871,CX,And worse essays prov’d thee my best of love.
1872,CX,"Now all is done, save what shall have no end:"
1873,CX,Mine appetite I never more will grind
1874,CX,"On newer proof, to try an older friend,"
1875,CX,"A god in love, to whom I am confin’d."
1876,CX,"Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,"

1881,CXI,"O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,"
1882,CXI,"The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,"
1883,CXI,That did not better for my life provide
1884,CXI,Than public means which public manners breeds.
1885,CXI,"Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,"
1886,CXI,And almost thence my nature is subdu’d
1887,CXI,"To what it works in, like the dyer’s hand:"
1888,CXI,"Pity me, then, and wish I were renew’d;"
1889,CXI,"Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,"
1890,CXI,Potions of eisel ’gainst my strong infection;
1891,CXI,"No bitterness that I will bitter think,"
1892,CXI,"Nor double penance, to correct correction."
1893,CXI,"Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,"

1896,CXII,CXII
1897,CXII,
1898,CXII,"Your love and pity doth the impression fill,"
1899,CXII,Which vulgar scandal stamp’d upon my brow;
1900,CXII,"For what care I who calls me well or ill,"
1901,CXII,"So you o’er-green my bad, my good allow?"
1902,CXII,"You are my all-the-world, and I must strive"
1903,CXII,To know my shames and praises from your tongue;
1904,CXII,"None else to me, nor I to none alive,"
1905,CXII,That my steel’d sense or changes right or wrong.
1906,CXII,In so profound abysm I throw all care
1907,CXII,"Of others’ voices, that my adder’s sense"
1908,CXII,To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
1909,CXII,Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
1910,CXII,"You are so strongly in my purpose bred,"

1917,CXIII,"Doth part his function and is partly blind,"
1918,CXIII,"Seems seeing, but effectually is out;"
1919,CXIII,For it no form delivers to the heart
1920,CXIII,"Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:"
1921,CXIII,"Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,"
1922,CXIII,Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;
1923,CXIII,"For if it see the rud’st or gentlest sight,"
1924,CXIII,"The most sweet favour or deformed’st creature,"
1925,CXIII,"The mountain or the sea, the day or night:"
1926,CXIII,"The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature."
1927,CXIII,"Incapable of more, replete with you,"
1928,CXIII,My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.
1929,CXIII,
1930,CXIV,CXIV
1931,CXIV,
1932,CXIV,"Or whether doth my mind, being crown’d with you,"
1933,CXIV,"Drink up the monarch’s plague, this flattery?"
1934,CXIV,"Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,"
1935,CXIV,"And that your love taught it this alchemy,"
1936,CXIV,To make of monsters and things indigest
1937,CXIV,"Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,"
1938,CXIV,"Creating every bad a perfect best,"
1939,CXIV,As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
1940,CXIV,"O! ’tis the first, ’tis flattery in my seeing,"
1941,CXIV,And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
1942,CXIV,"Mine eye well knows what with his gust is ’greeing,"
1943,CXIV,And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
1944,CXIV,"If it be poison’d, ’tis the lesser sin"

1949,CXV,"Those lines that I before have writ do lie,"
1950,CXV,Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
1951,CXV,Yet then my judgement knew no reason why
1952,CXV,My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
1953,CXV,"But reckoning Time, whose million’d accidents"
1954,CXV,"Creep in ’twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,"
1955,CXV,"Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp’st intents,"
1956,CXV,Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
1957,CXV,"Alas! why fearing of Time’s tyranny,"
1958,CXV,"Might I not then say, ‘Now I love you best,’"
1959,CXV,"When I was certain o’er incertainty,"
1960,CXV,"Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?"
1961,CXV,"Love is a babe, then might I not say so,"

1964,CXVI,CXVI
1965,CXVI,
1966,CXVI,Let me not to the marriage of true minds
1967,CXVI,Admit impediments. Love is not love
1968,CXVI,"Which alters when it alteration finds,"
1969,CXVI,Or bends with the remover to remove:
1970,CXVI,"O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,"
1971,CXVI,That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
1972,CXVI,"It is the star to every wandering bark,"
1973,CXVI,"Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken."
1974,CXVI,"Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks"
1975,CXVI,Within his bending sickle’s compass come;
1976,CXVI,"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,"
1977,CXVI,But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
1978,CXVI,"If this be error and upon me prov’d,"
1979,CXVI,"I never writ, nor no man ever lov’d."
1980,CXVI,
1981,CXVII,CXVII
1982,CXVII,
1983,CXVII,"Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,"
1984,CXVII,"Wherein I should your great deserts repay,"
1985,CXVII,"Forgot upon your dearest love to call,"
1986,CXVII,Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
1987,CXVII,"That I have frequent been with unknown minds,"
1988,CXVII,And given to time your own dear-purchas’d right;
1989,CXVII,That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
1990,CXVII,Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
1991,CXVII,"Book both my wilfulness and errors down,"
1992,CXVII,"And on just proof surmise, accumulate;"
1993,CXVII,"Bring me within the level of your frown,"
1994,CXVII,But shoot not at me in your waken’d hate;
1995,CXVII,Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
1996,CXVII,The constancy and virtue of your love.

1998,CXVIII,CXVIII
1999,CXVIII,
2000,CXVIII,"Like as, to make our appetite more keen,"
2001,CXVIII,With eager compounds we our palate urge;
2002,CXVIII,"As, to prevent our maladies unseen,"
2003,CXVIII,We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;
2004,CXVIII,"Even so, being full of your ne’er-cloying sweetness,"
2005,CXVIII,To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;
2006,CXVIII,"And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness"
2007,CXVIII,"To be diseas’d, ere that there was true needing."
2008,CXVIII,"Thus policy in love, to anticipate"
2009,CXVIII,"The ills that were not, grew to faults assur’d,"
2010,CXVIII,And brought to medicine a healthful state
2011,CXVIII,"Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur’d;"
2012,CXVIII,"But thence I learn and find the lesson true,"
2013,CXVIII,Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.

2019,CXIX,"Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,"
2020,CXIX,Still losing when I saw myself to win!
2021,CXIX,"What wretched errors hath my heart committed,"
2022,CXIX,Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
2023,CXIX,"How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,"
2024,CXIX,In the distraction of this madding fever!
2025,CXIX,O benefit of ill! now I find true
2026,CXIX,"That better is, by evil still made better;"
2027,CXIX,"And ruin’d love, when it is built anew,"
2028,CXIX,"Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater."
2029,CXIX,"So I return rebuk’d to my content,"

2037,CXX,Unless my nerves were brass or hammer’d steel.
2038,CXX,"For if you were by my unkindness shaken,"
2039,CXX,"As I by yours, you’ve pass’d a hell of time;"
2040,CXX,"And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken"
2041,CXX,To weigh how once I suffer’d in your crime.
2042,CXX,O! that our night of woe might have remember’d
2043,CXX,"My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,"
2044,CXX,"And soon to you, as you to me, then tender’d"
2045,CXX,"The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!"

2055,CXXI,For why should others’ false adulterate eyes
2056,CXXI,Give salutation to my sportive blood?
2057,CXXI,"Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,"
2058,CXXI,Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
2059,CXXI,"No, I am that I am, and they that level"
2060,CXXI,At my abuses reckon up their own:
2061,CXXI,I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;

2113,CXXIV,"That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers."

2151,CXXVII,"In the old age black was not counted fair,"
2152,CXXVII,"Or if it were, it bore not beauty’s name;"
2153,CXXVII,"But now is black beauty’s successive heir,"
2154,CXXVII,And beauty slander’d with a bastard shame:
2155,CXXVII,"For since each hand hath put on Nature’s power,"
2156,CXXVII,"Fairing the foul with Art’s false borrowed face,"
2157,CXXVII,"Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,"
2158,CXXVII,"But is profan’d, if not lives in disgrace."
2159,CXXVII,"Therefore my mistress’ eyes are raven black,"
2160,CXXVII,"Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem"
2161,CXXVII,"At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,"
2162,CXXVII,Sland’ring creation with a false esteem:
2163,CXXVII,"Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,"
2164,CXXVII,That every tongue says beauty should look so.

2168,CXXVIII,"How oft when thou, my music, music play’st,"
2169,CXXVIII,Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
2170,CXXVIII,With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway’st
2171,CXXVIII,"The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,"
2172,CXXVIII,"Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,"
2173,CXXVIII,"To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,"
2174,CXXVIII,"Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,"
2175,CXXVIII,At the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand!
2176,CXXVIII,"To be so tickled, they would change their state"
2177,CXXVIII,"And situation with those dancing chips,"
2178,CXXVIII,"O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,"
2179,CXXVIII,Making dead wood more bless’d than living lips.
2180,CXXVIII,"Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,"
2181,CXXVIII,"Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss."

2185,CXXIX,The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
2186,CXXIX,"Is lust in action: and till action, lust"
2187,CXXIX,"Is perjur’d, murderous, bloody, full of blame,"
2188,CXXIX,"Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;"
2189,CXXIX,Enjoy’d no sooner but despised straight;
2190,CXXIX,"Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,"
2191,CXXIX,"Past reason hated, as a swallow’d bait,"
2192,CXXIX,On purpose laid to make the taker mad:
2193,CXXIX,Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
2194,CXXIX,"Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme;"
2195,CXXIX,"A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;"
2196,CXXIX,"Before, a joy propos’d; behind a dream."
2197,CXXIX,All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
2198,CXXIX,To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

2202,CXXX,My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;
2203,CXXX,"Coral is far more red, than her lips red:"
2204,CXXX,"If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;"
2205,CXXX,"If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head."
2206,CXXX,"I have seen roses damask’d, red and white,"
2207,CXXX,But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
2208,CXXX,And in some perfumes is there more delight
2209,CXXX,Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
2210,CXXX,"I love to hear her speak, yet well I know"
2211,CXXX,That music hath a far more pleasing sound:
2212,CXXX,I grant I never saw a goddess go;
2213,CXXX,"My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:"
2214,CXXX,"And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,"

2219,CXXXI,"Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,"

2221,CXXXI,For well thou know’st to my dear doting heart
2222,CXXXI,Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
2223,CXXXI,"Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,"
2224,CXXXI,Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
2225,CXXXI,"To say they err I dare not be so bold,"
2226,CXXXI,Although I swear it to myself alone.
2227,CXXXI,"And to be sure that is not false I swear,"
2228,CXXXI,"A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,"
2229,CXXXI,"One on another’s neck, do witness bear"
2230,CXXXI,Thy black is fairest in my judgement’s place.
2231,CXXXI,"In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,"

2239,CXXXII,Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
2240,CXXXII,And truly not the morning sun of heaven
2241,CXXXII,"Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,"
2242,CXXXII,"Nor that full star that ushers in the even,"
2243,CXXXII,"Doth half that glory to the sober west,"
2244,CXXXII,As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
2245,CXXXII,O! let it then as well beseem thy heart
2246,CXXXII,"To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,"
2247,CXXXII,And suit thy pity like in every part.
2248,CXXXII,"Then will I swear beauty herself is black,"
2249,CXXXII,And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
2250,CXXXII,
2251,CXXXIII,CXXXIII
2252,CXXXIII,

2254,CXXXIII,For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
2255,CXXXIII,"Is’t not enough to torture me alone,"
2256,CXXXIII,But slave to slavery my sweet’st friend must be?
2257,CXXXIII,"Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,"
2258,CXXXIII,And my next self thou harder hast engross’d:
2259,CXXXIII,"Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;"
2260,CXXXIII,A torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross’d:
2261,CXXXIII,"Prison my heart in thy steel bosom’s ward,"
2262,CXXXIII,But then my friend’s heart let my poor heart bail;
2263,CXXXIII,"Whoe’er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;"
2264,CXXXIII,Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:
2265,CXXXIII,"And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,"
2266,CXXXIII,"Perforce am thine, and all that is in me."

2272,CXXXIV,"Myself I’ll forfeit, so that other mine"
2273,CXXXIV,Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
2274,CXXXIV,"But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,"
2275,CXXXIV,"For thou art covetous, and he is kind;"
2276,CXXXIV,"He learn’d but surety-like to write for me,"
2277,CXXXIV,Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
2278,CXXXIV,"The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,"
2279,CXXXIV,"Thou usurer, that putt’st forth all to use,"
2280,CXXXIV,And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
2281,CXXXIV,So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
2282,CXXXIV,Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:

2286,CXXXV,

2289,CXXXV,"More than enough am I that vex’d thee still,"
2290,CXXXV,To thy sweet will making addition thus.
2291,CXXXV,"Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,"
2292,CXXXV,Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
2293,CXXXV,"Shall will in others seem right gracious,"
2294,CXXXV,And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
2295,CXXXV,"The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,"
2296,CXXXV,And in abundance addeth to his store;
2297,CXXXV,"So thou, being rich in ‘Will,’ add to thy ‘Will’"
2298,CXXXV,"One will of mine, to make thy large will more."
2299,CXXXV,Let no unkind ‘No’ fair beseechers kill;

2303,CXXXVI,
2304,CXXXVI,"If thy soul check thee that I come so near,"

2307,CXXXVI,"Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil."
2308,CXXXVI,"‘Will’, will fulfil the treasure of thy love,"
2309,CXXXVI,"Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one."
2310,CXXXVI,In things of great receipt with ease we prove
2311,CXXXVI,Among a number one is reckon’d none:
2312,CXXXVI,"Then in the number let me pass untold,"
2313,CXXXVI,Though in thy store’s account I one must be;
2314,CXXXVI,"For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold"
2315,CXXXVI,"That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:"
2316,CXXXVI,"Make but my name thy love, and love that still,"

2325,CXXXVII,"If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,"
2326,CXXXVII,"Be anchor’d in the bay where all men ride,"
2327,CXXXVII,"Why of eyes’ falsehood hast thou forged hooks,"
2328,CXXXVII,Whereto the judgement of my heart is tied?
2329,CXXXVII,"Why should my heart think that a several plot,"
2330,CXXXVII,Which my heart knows the wide world’s common place?
2331,CXXXVII,"Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,"
2332,CXXXVII,To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
2333,CXXXVII,"In things right true my heart and eyes have err’d,"

2341,CXXXVIII,Unlearned in the world’s false subtleties.
2342,CXXXVIII,"Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,"
2343,CXXXVIII,"Although she knows my days are past the best,"
2344,CXXXVIII,Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:
2345,CXXXVIII,On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
2346,CXXXVIII,But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
2347,CXXXVIII,And wherefore say not I that I am old?
2348,CXXXVIII,"O! love’s best habit is in seeming trust,"
2349,CXXXVIII,"And age in love, loves not to have years told:"
2350,CXXXVIII,"Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,"

2364,CXXXIX,Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;

2366,CXXXIX,That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:

2377,CXL,"If I might teach thee wit, better it were,"

2379,CXL,"As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,"
2380,CXL,No news but health from their physicians know.

2545,CL,"To make me give the lie to my true sight,"
2546,CL,And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
2547,CL,"Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,"
2548,CL,That in the very refuse of thy deeds
2549,CL,"There is such strength and warrantise of skill,"
2550,CL,"That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?"
2551,CL,"Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,"
2552,CL,The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
2553,CL,"O! though I love what others do abhor,"
2554,CL,With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
2555,CL,"If thy unworthiness rais’d love in me,"
2556,CL,More worthy I to be belov’d of thee.

2560,CLI,"Love is too young to know what conscience is,"
2561,CLI,Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
2562,CLI,"Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,"
2563,CLI,Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
2564,CLI,"For, thou betraying me, I do betray"
2565,CLI,My nobler part to my gross body’s treason;
2566,CLI,My soul doth tell my body that he may
2567,CLI,"Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,"
2568,CLI,"But rising at thy name doth point out thee,"
2569,CLI,"As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,"
2570,CLI,"He is contented thy poor drudge to be,"
2571,CLI,"To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side."
2572,CLI,No want of conscience hold it that I call
2573,CLI,"Her ‘love,’ for whose dear love I rise and fall."

2579,CLII,"In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,"
2580,CLII,In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
2581,CLII,"But why of two oaths’ breach do I accuse thee,"
2582,CLII,When I break twenty? I am perjur’d most;
2583,CLII,"For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,"
2584,CLII,And all my honest faith in thee is lost:
2585,CLII,"For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,"
2586,CLII,"Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;"
2587,CLII,"And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,"
2588,CLII,Or made them swear against the thing they see;
2589,CLII,"For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,"
2590,CLII,To swear against the truth so foul a lie.

2594,CLIII,Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
2595,CLIII,"A maid of Dian’s this advantage found,"
2596,CLIII,And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
2597,CLIII,In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
2598,CLIII,"Which borrow’d from this holy fire of Love,"
2599,CLIII,"A dateless lively heat, still to endure,"
2600,CLIII,"And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove"
2601,CLIII,Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
2602,CLIII,"But at my mistress’ eye Love’s brand new-fired,"
2603,CLIII,The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
2604,CLIII,"I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,"
2605,CLIII,"And thither hied, a sad distemper’d guest,"
2606,CLIII,"But found no cure, the bath for my help lies"
2607,CLIII,Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress’ eyes.

2612,CLIV,"Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,"
2613,CLIV,Whilst many nymphs that vow’d chaste life to keep
2614,CLIV,Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
2615,CLIV,The fairest votary took up that fire
2616,CLIV,Which many legions of true hearts had warm’d;
2617,CLIV,And so the general of hot desire
2618,CLIV,"Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm’d."
2619,CLIV,"This brand she quenched in a cool well by,"
2620,CLIV,"Which from Love’s fire took heat perpetual,"
2621,CLIV,"Growing a bath and healthful remedy,"
2622,CLIV,"For men diseased; but I, my mistress’ thrall,"
2623,CLIV,"Came there for cure and this by that I prove,"
2624,CLIV,"Love’s fire heats water, water cools not love."
