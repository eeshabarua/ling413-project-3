30,PART I.,
31,PART I.,
32,PART I.,Marsk Stig he out of the country rode
33,PART I.,To win him fame with his good bright sword;
34,PART I.,At home meantide the King will bide
35,PART I.,In hope to lure his heart’s ador’d.
36,PART I.,
37,PART I.,The King sends word to the Marshal Stig
38,PART I.,That he to the fields of war should fare;
39,PART I.,Himself will deign at home to remain
40,PART I.,And take the charge of his Lady fair.
41,PART I.,
42,PART I.,"In came the Marshal’s serving man,"
43,PART I.,And a kirtle of green that man he wore:
44,PART I.,“Of our good liege the little foot-page
45,PART I.,Is standing out the gate before.”
46,PART I.,
47,PART I.,"Up stood the young Sir Marshal Stig,"
48,PART I.,By the side of his bed his clothes put on;
49,PART I.,"And to speak the boy, the King’s envoy,"
50,PART I.,Down to the gate is the Marshal gone.
51,PART I.,
52,PART I.,"“Now hear thou, Marsk Stig Andersen,"
53,PART I.,’Tis truth and sooth what I say to thee;
54,PART I.,"Thou must away to the King’s palay,"
55,PART I.,Then mount thy horse and follow with me.
56,PART I.,
57,PART I.,"“Oh, I know nought of my Lord King’s thought"
58,PART I.,"That I to thee can now declare,"
59,PART I.,Except that thou to the war must go
60,PART I.,And there thy sovereign’s banner bear.”
61,PART I.,
62,PART I.,"Then in at the door Sir Marsk Stig trode,"
63,PART I.,And a wrathful man I trow was he:
64,PART I.,"“By the Saints I swear, my Lady dear,"
65,PART I.,Fulfill’d my dreary dream will be.
66,PART I.,
67,PART I.,“For of late I dream’d that my noble horse
68,PART I.,To chase the wild mare ran away;
69,PART I.,"And that must mean that I shall be slain,"
70,PART I.,And that my steed will tramp on my life-less clay.”
71,PART I.,
72,PART I.,"“Now hold thy tongue, my noble Lord,"
73,PART I.,"And do not talk thus foolishly,"
74,PART I.,"For Christ can protect thy life, reflect,"
75,PART I.,The blessed Christ who dwells on high.”
76,PART I.,
77,PART I.,It was the young and bold Marsk Stig
78,PART I.,"Came riding into the Castle yard,"
79,PART I.,Abroad did stand the King of the land
80,PART I.,So fair array’d in sable and mard.
81,PART I.,
82,PART I.,"“Now lend an ear, young Marshal Stig,"
83,PART I.,"I have for thee a fair emprise,"
84,PART I.,"Ride thou this year to the war, and bear"
85,PART I.,My flag amongst my enemies.”
86,PART I.,
87,PART I.,"“And if I shall fare to the war this year,"
88,PART I.,"And risk my life among thy foes,"
89,PART I.,"Do thou take care of my Lady dear,"
90,PART I.,Of Ingeborg that beauteous rose.”
91,PART I.,
92,PART I.,"Then answer’d Erik, the youthful King,"
93,PART I.,With a laugh in his sleeve thus answer’d he:
94,PART I.,“No more I swear has thy lady to fear
95,PART I.,Than if my sister dear were she.
96,PART I.,
97,PART I.,"“Full well I’ll watch Dame Ingeborg,"
98,PART I.,And guard and cherish her night and day;
99,PART I.,As little I swear has thy Lady to fear
100,PART I.,"As if thou, dear Marshal, at home didst stay.”"
101,PART I.,
102,PART I.,"It was then the bold Sir Marshal Stig,"
103,PART I.,From out of the country he did depart.
104,PART I.,"In her castle sate his lonely mate,"
105,PART I.,"Fair Ingeborg, with grief at heart."
106,PART I.,
107,PART I.,"“Now saddle my steed,” cried Eric the King,"
108,PART I.,"“Now saddle my steed,” King Eric cried,"
109,PART I.,“To visit the Dame of beauteous fame
110,PART I.,Your King will into the country ride.”
111,PART I.,
112,PART I.,"“Hail, hail to thee, Dame Ingeborg,"
113,PART I.,"If thou wilt not be coy and cold,"
114,PART I.,"A shirt, I trow, for me thou’lt sew,"
115,PART I.,And array that shirt so fair with gold.”
116,PART I.,
117,PART I.,"“Sew’d I for thee a shirt, Sir King,"
118,PART I.,"And worked that shirt, Sir King, with gold,"
119,PART I.,Should Marsk Stig hear of that he’d ne’er
120,PART I.,With favour again his wife behold.”
121,PART I.,
122,PART I.,"“Now list, now list, Dame Ingeborg,"
123,PART I.,"Thou art, I swear, a beauteous star,"
124,PART I.,"Live thou with me in love and glee,"
125,PART I.,Whilst Marshal Stig is engag’d in war.”
126,PART I.,
127,PART I.,"Then up and spake Dame Ingeborg,"
128,PART I.,For nought was she but a virtuous wife:
129,PART I.,"“Rather, I say, than Stig betray,"
130,PART I.,"Sir King, I’d gladly lose my life.”"
131,PART I.,
132,PART I.,"“Give ear, thou proud Dame Ingeborg,"
133,PART I.,"If thou my leman and love will be,"
134,PART I.,Each finger fair of thy hand shall bear
135,PART I.,A ring of gold so red of blee.”
136,PART I.,
137,PART I.,"“Marsk Stig has given gold rings to me,"
138,PART I.,And pearls around my neck to string;
139,PART I.,By the Saints above I never will prove
140,PART I.,"Untrue to the Marshal’s couch, Sir King."
141,PART I.,
142,PART I.,“And when Sir Marsk Stig left the land
143,PART I.,"Thou unto him, Sir King, didst swear"
144,PART I.,Thou wouldst tend me and defend me
145,PART I.,E’en as if I your sister were.”
146,PART I.,
147,PART I.,"It was the fair Dame Ingeborg,"
148,PART I.,"So great, so great was her vexation;"
149,PART I.,"Early and late, sunshine and wet,"
150,PART I.,The King he sought her habitation.
151,PART I.,
152,PART I.,"It was Erik the Danish King,"
153,PART I.,A damnable deed the King he wrought;
154,PART I.,"He forc’d with might that Lady bright,"
155,PART I.,Whilst her good Lord his battles fought.
156,PART I.,
157,PART I.,It was the young Sir Marshal Stig
158,PART I.,Came home again from the battle field.
159,PART I.,"To him then sped such tidings dread,"
160,PART I.,His very blood those tidings chill’d.
161,PART I.,
162,PART I.,"And when he came to his country home,"
163,PART I.,Away to his castle Sir Stig he rode;
164,PART I.,Then Ingeborg Dame for very shame
165,PART I.,No word of welcome on him bestow’d.
166,PART I.,
167,PART I.,"It was the young and bold Marsk Stig,"
168,PART I.,So swiftly in at the door he hies;
169,PART I.,His beauteous dame for very shame
170,PART I.,To welcome the Marshal could not rise.
171,PART I.,
172,PART I.,"And long stood he, the young Marsk Stig,"
173,PART I.,And thus within himself thought he;
174,PART I.,“Now wherefore shows my beauteous spouse
175,PART I.,No more respect or love for me?”
176,PART I.,
177,PART I.,"Then answer’d fair Dame Ingeborg,"
178,PART I.,Whilst tears adown her features pour’d:
179,PART I.,"“Welcome, I say, from the battle fray,"
180,PART I.,Marsk Stig my bosom’s dearest lord.
181,PART I.,
182,PART I.,"“Now do thou hear, young Marshal Stig,"
183,PART I.,"Of a dreadful wrong I must complain,"
184,PART I.,The King accurst has my body forc’d
185,PART I.,And my matron honour from me has ta’en.
186,PART I.,
187,PART I.,"“When thou didst leave the land, I was"
188,PART I.,The honour’d Dame of a simple knight;
189,PART I.,"Now am I Queen in Denmark green,"
190,PART I.,With a stain that makes me hate the light.
191,PART I.,
192,PART I.,"“The time that thou from the land didst go,"
193,PART I.,I was but the wife of a Noble brave;
194,PART I.,"Now am I Queen in Denmark green,"
195,PART I.,Longing to hide me in the grave.”
196,PART I.,
197,PART I.,It was then the young Marsk Stig
198,PART I.,He grasp’d amain his dagger knife:
199,PART I.,"“If truth it be that thou tellest me,"
200,PART I.,’Twill cost the traitor King his life.
201,PART I.,
202,PART I.,"“Never will I sweet sleep enjoy,"
203,PART I.,"Lock’d in thy snowy arms, my fair,"
204,PART I.,Till ruin I bring on the traitor King
205,PART I.,Who laid for us this deadly snare.
206,PART I.,
207,PART I.,"“And never, never, O Ingeborg,"
208,PART I.,"By thy snowy side again I’ll lie,"
209,PART I.,Till I out-pour the reeking gore
210,PART I.,Of him who has wrought this injury.”
211,PART I.,
212,PART I.,"Long, long stood the bold Marsk Stig,"
213,PART I.,Musing with look so stern and grave:
214,PART I.,"“If on the King I’d avenge this thing,"
215,PART I.,Notice from me he must quickly have.”
216,PART I.,
217,PART I.,"Marsk Stig he arms his courtiers good,"
218,PART I.,"Arms them in hauberks glittering,"
219,PART I.,And he rides on the morrow to Skanderborough
220,PART I.,To summon King Erik to the Ting.
221,PART I.,
222,PART I.,It was the Danish Queen so fine
223,PART I.,From the window high a glance she cast:
224,PART I.,"“Across the wold comes Marsk Stig bold,"
225,PART I.,Why rides the Marshal Stig so fast?
226,PART I.,
227,PART I.,"“And yonder prances the Marshal Stig,"
228,PART I.,And hither from Sonderbrook rides he;
229,PART I.,Each plumy swain in his galloping train
230,PART I.,Is like a bonny grey dow to see.”
231,PART I.,
232,PART I.,"It was the young and bold Marsk Stig,"
233,PART I.,So stately stepped the threshold o’er;
234,PART I.,The Danish Queen so sharp and keen
235,PART I.,She straight began to scoff him sore.
236,PART I.,
237,PART I.,"“Thrice welcome, thrice welcome, Dus Van Hus,"
238,PART I.,"Welcome, thrice welcome again, I cry;"
239,PART I.,"Thou bear’st the brow like a King, I trow,"
240,PART I.,Yet little good thou wilt gain thereby.”
241,PART I.,
242,PART I.,"“Madam! my name is not Dus Van Hus,"
243,PART I.,"How dar’st thou beard me in this strain,"
244,PART I.,"When I know one, Black Haddingson,"
245,PART I.,"Who oft, full oft, on thy breast has lain?"
246,PART I.,
247,PART I.,“Gain I no other recompense here
248,PART I.,"Than scoff and scorn from a thing like thee,"
249,PART I.,Before the crowd I’ll complain aloud
250,PART I.,Of the wrong and injury done to me.
251,PART I.,
252,PART I.,"“First I will state my injuries great,"
253,PART I.,Which man nor woman cannot deny;
254,PART I.,"And unless I’m given amends, by heaven"
255,PART I.,Another game will the Marshal try.”
256,PART I.,
257,PART I.,
258,PART I.,
259,PART II.,PART II.
260,PART II.,
261,PART II.,
262,PART II.,"Marsk Stig he woke at black midnight,"
263,PART II.,And loudly cried to his Lady dear:
264,PART II.,"“O dreamed have I so wondrously,"
265,PART II.,God read what I’ve been dreaming here!
266,PART II.,
267,PART II.,"“I dream’d my ship, my tall, tall ship,"
268,PART II.,To a boat did dwindle suddenly;
269,PART II.,"Its mast was gone, it helm had none,"
270,PART II.,Full soon it sank in the briny sea.
271,PART II.,
272,PART II.,“I dream’d that each of my little pups
273,PART II.,Was become at once a savage boar;
274,PART II.,"Through my garden wall they broke, and all"
275,PART II.,My pleasant herbs and roots uptore.
276,PART II.,
277,PART II.,“And I dream’d as I and my courtiers good
278,PART II.,"Were riding over the bridge so wide,"
279,PART II.,My trusty horse with sudden force
280,PART II.,"Flung me, and into the forest hied.”"
281,PART II.,
282,PART II.,"Then answer’d proud Dame Ingeborg,"
283,PART II.,Straight answer’d she her dear lord thus:
284,PART II.,"“To God alone in heaven is known,"
285,PART II.,"My Lord, how it will fare with us."
286,PART II.,
287,PART II.,"“Lie thou and rest, my noble Lord,"
288,PART II.,And from thy thought the vision fling;
289,PART II.,It means no doubt our vassals stout
290,PART II.,Their rent and tribute soon will bring.”
291,PART II.,
292,PART II.,"“Not so, not so, it means, I trow,"
293,PART II.,"Although thou tell’st me that, my love,"
294,PART II.,"It means the King at our country’s Ting,"
295,PART II.,Too much for me and my cause will prove.”
296,PART II.,
297,PART II.,"Marsk Stig he arms seven hundred men,"
298,PART II.,Each one in iron panoply;
299,PART II.,And away he scowers to Viborg’s towers
300,PART II.,The traitor monarch to defy.
301,PART II.,
302,PART II.,"And at their head young Marsk Stig sped,"
303,PART II.,And in his heart he felt so bold;
304,PART II.,"Behind him rode his courtiers proud,"
305,PART II.,Their breast-plates beaming bright with gold.
306,PART II.,
307,PART II.,It was the young Sir Marshal Stig
308,PART II.,Stepp’d proudly in at the lofty door;
309,PART II.,"And bold knights then, and bold knights’ men,"
310,PART II.,Stood up the Marshal Stig before.
311,PART II.,
312,PART II.,"So up to the Ting of the land he goes,"
313,PART II.,And straight to make his plaint began;
314,PART II.,"Then murmured loud the assembled crowd,"
315,PART II.,And clench’d his fist each honest man.
316,PART II.,
317,PART II.,"“Ye good men hear a tale of fear,"
318,PART II.,"A tale of horror, a tale of hell;"
319,PART II.,"A rape upon my wife’s been done,"
320,PART II.,With frantic grief the tale I tell.”
321,PART II.,
322,PART II.,"Then up did spring the Danish King,"
323,PART II.,And proffer’d to Stig his fair white hand:
324,PART II.,"“I joy thou art come, Sir Marsk Stig, home"
325,PART II.,Safe from the fray in the foreign land.”
326,PART II.,
327,PART II.,"Then answer’d him the Marshal Stig,"
328,PART II.,His heart was fill’d with grief and rage:
329,PART II.,“And trouble and cost I more than lost
330,PART II.,When forth I went the fight to wage.
331,PART II.,
332,PART II.,"“To the field of war I went afar,"
333,PART II.,And for thy realm I risk’d my life;
334,PART II.,"But thou didst stay and, welladay,"
335,PART II.,Didst foully force my virtuous wife.”
336,PART II.,
337,PART II.,"Then answer’d him the youthful King,"
338,PART II.,As sly he laughed his cap below:
339,PART II.,“The Lady’s yes and willingness
340,PART II.,Were ready as mine own I trow.”
341,PART II.,
342,PART II.,"Then answer made the young Marsk Stig,"
343,PART II.,With a darkling brow and kindling eye:
344,PART II.,“’Tis a saying true and an old one too
345,PART II.,That insult follows injury.
346,PART II.,
347,PART II.,"“Thou’st forc’d my housewife, and hast brought"
348,PART II.,Distress and shame upon our head;
349,PART II.,"But know one thing, my gracious King,"
350,PART II.,Thy life to Stig is forfeited.”
351,PART II.,
352,PART II.,Then as he turn’d him from the Ting
353,PART II.,He doff’d his hat with knightly pride;
354,PART II.,“Ye good men here in memory bear
355,PART II.,I have the traitor King defied.”
356,PART II.,
357,PART II.,"“Now do thou hear, Sir Marsk Stig dear,"
358,PART II.,"Cease, cease such frantic talk to hold;"
359,PART II.,And I’ll bestow on thee enow
360,PART II.,"Of castles, land, and ruddy gold."
361,PART II.,
362,PART II.,"“Eight castles fair, the best that are"
363,PART II.,"In all the land where dwells the Dane,"
364,PART II.,"May well atone for what is done,"
365,PART II.,Receive them and my friend remain.”
366,PART II.,
367,PART II.,"“I do not care for your castles fair,"
368,PART II.,"Castles enow I have already,"
369,PART II.,I wish undone the deed upon
370,PART II.,The body of my virtuous Lady.”
371,PART II.,
372,PART II.,"“Marsk Stig! Marsk Stig! ride not so high,"
373,PART II.,"I hope to guard myself, proud Earl!"
374,PART II.,"Although thou be my enemy,"
375,PART II.,I trust I run no mighty peril.”
376,PART II.,
377,PART II.,"“However high, Sir King, I ride,"
378,PART II.,Thou lov’st to play a higher part;
379,PART II.,Hast thou ne’er heard the olden word
380,PART II.,That power must often yield to art?
381,PART II.,
382,PART II.,“I’m not so mighty nor so strong
383,PART II.,"That I can hope to bar thy way,"
384,PART II.,But oft I’ve seen a greyhound keen
385,PART II.,Alone the antler’d monarch slay.
386,PART II.,
387,PART II.,"“I’m not at the head of so many swords,"
388,PART II.,That I can check thee when thou wouldst pass;
389,PART II.,"But a little lever, if us’d but clever,"
390,PART II.,Can overturn a weighty mass.”
391,PART II.,
392,PART II.,"Then away rode he the young Marsk Stig,"
393,PART II.,To Ingeborga’s bower repairing:
394,PART II.,"“Now welcome thrice, Marsk Stig,” she cries,"
395,PART II.,“I’ve heard of Marsk Stig’s manly bearing.
396,PART II.,
397,PART II.,"“Fear not the King nor all his might,"
398,PART II.,Of courage high he has no spark;
399,PART II.,Throughout the state he’s won the hate
400,PART II.,"Of every layman, priest, and clerk."
401,PART II.,
402,PART II.,“I have a loving nephew got
403,PART II.,Who waits the traitor King upon;
404,PART II.,"He’ll be our spy, and privily"
405,PART II.,Will send us word when the King’s alone.
406,PART II.,
407,PART II.,“And when ye’ve slain the brutal pard
408,PART II.,"Who in drink and slumber finds delight,"
409,PART II.,By ye will stand of Norway land
410,PART II.,The King so bold with his men of might.
411,PART II.,
412,PART II.,“If thou on Helm a fortress build
413,PART II.,"It ne’er can be won by human hands,"
414,PART II.,"From its brow so high you may Sealand spy,"
415,PART II.,"Jutland, and other lesser lands."
416,PART II.,
417,PART II.,"“Whilst thou dost live thou a knight shalt be,"
418,PART II.,But my grief for me is far too strong;
419,PART II.,So blythe my breath I’ll yield to death
420,PART II.,When Marshal Stig has aveng’d my wrong.
421,PART II.,
422,PART II.,“I ne’er have peace nor gladness known
423,PART II.,Since tyrant Glepping’s deed of force;
424,PART II.,May Jesus bless with good success
425,PART II.,My gallant Stig in his gallant course.
426,PART II.,
427,PART II.,"“And bless our daughters’ youthful blood,"
428,PART II.,"Oft, full oft on their fate I ponder;"
429,PART II.,"Much I fear when I’m gone from here,"
430,PART II.,Far and wide they’ll have to wander.
431,PART II.,
432,PART II.,"“An action high shall never die,"
433,PART II.,Whatever dastard lips may say;
434,PART II.,’Twill wake up bold from out the mould
435,PART II.,And boldly speak on the judgment day.
436,PART II.,
437,PART II.,"“Then speed thee, knight, with thee is right,"
438,PART II.,Avenge the heart which loves thee dear;
439,PART II.,"On earthly shore though we meet no more,"
440,PART II.,We shall meet again in the sky so clear.”
441,PART II.,
442,PART II.,
443,PART II.,
444,PART III.,PART III.
445,PART III.,
446,PART III.,
447,PART III.,There’s many I ween in Denmark green
448,PART III.,Who all to be masters now desire;
449,PART III.,"To Ribe old their course they hold,"
450,PART III.,And there they buy them strange attire.
451,PART III.,
452,PART III.,There they prepare such clothes as wear
453,PART III.,"The holy Monks of orders grey,"
454,PART III.,And this they’ve done in the hope alone
455,PART III.,Their liege and sovereign to betray.
456,PART III.,
457,PART III.,"They watch’d him sly, they watch’d him nigh,"
458,PART III.,Whether the King went down or up;
459,PART III.,"But best they sped, in the hour so dread,"
460,PART III.,When the King would ride to Tinderup.
461,PART III.,
462,PART III.,"The cause of the same was an injur’d Dame,"
463,PART III.,Bold Stig the Marshal’s lovely wife;
464,PART III.,With Ranild a plot she up has got
465,PART III.,Which cost King Erik his youthful life.
466,PART III.,
467,PART III.,"Ranild the loon, her sister’s son,"
468,PART III.,"Ranild who serv’d King Erik near,"
469,PART III.,"Tells him with art of hind and hart,"
470,PART III.,And of silvan game to the hunter dear.
471,PART III.,
472,PART III.,“To thee I can show both buck and doe
473,PART III.,Within the bonny green wood that play;
474,PART III.,"With greyhounds tried we forth will ride,"
475,PART III.,"Sir King, not distant is the way.”"
476,PART III.,
477,PART III.,Then Erik he bade his serving lad
478,PART III.,To saddle him straight his good grey steed;
479,PART III.,"“To Jutland’s Ting will ride your King,"
480,PART III.,And see how things in Jutland speed.”
481,PART III.,
482,PART III.,And he order gave to his courtiers brave
483,PART III.,That they should before to Viborg hie;
484,PART III.,No thought he had that Ranild the lad
485,PART III.,Was brooding a subtle treachery.
486,PART III.,
487,PART III.,"But Ranild rode by a secret road,"
488,PART III.,And he bade the Monks themselves prepare;
489,PART III.,I tell to ye for a verity
490,PART III.,That Ranild practis’d cunning rare.
491,PART III.,
492,PART III.,"Now after the hart and hind they start,"
493,PART III.,And after the nimble roe as well;
494,PART III.,"The long day’s space endur’d the chase,"
495,PART III.,Till murky night upon them fell.
496,PART III.,
497,PART III.,"Then in faultering guise the King he cries,"
498,PART III.,For his heart I ween was full of dread:
499,PART III.,"“God help us now, and Saint Gertrude thou,"
500,PART III.,We fairly out of the path have sped.”
501,PART III.,
502,PART III.,"Then about he spied and about he pried,"
503,PART III.,"Amid the bushes so dark and drear,"
504,PART III.,Till sight he got of a little cot
505,PART III.,Where fire and light were burning clear.
506,PART III.,
507,PART III.,"And into that house King Erik goes,"
508,PART III.,His luck the Monarch there will try;
509,PART III.,"And he was aware of a damsel fair,"
510,PART III.,No fairer ever had met his eye.
511,PART III.,
512,PART III.,"And her to his breast the King he press’d,"
513,PART III.,And kiss’d her oft with fond delight:
514,PART III.,"“My lovely may, I beg and pray"
515,PART III.,That thou wilt sleep with me this night.”
516,PART III.,
517,PART III.,"Then answer’d and said the woodland maid,"
518,PART III.,With a burst of laughter wild and loud:
519,PART III.,“In mind I keep how thou didst sleep
520,PART III.,With Ingeborga fair and proud.
521,PART III.,
522,PART III.,"“Answer, I pray, and fairly say,"
523,PART III.,"How many maids hast thou, Sir King,"
524,PART III.,Deserted and left of fame bereft?
525,PART III.,For that will death upon thee bring.”
526,PART III.,
527,PART III.,"“If that thou know, fair maid, I trow"
528,PART III.,That thou canst tell much more to me;
529,PART III.,"Now tiding give how long I shall live,"
530,PART III.,And say how many my foemen be.”
531,PART III.,
532,PART III.,"With solemn air said the maiden fair,"
533,PART III.,“Hark thou to me and believe my word;
534,PART III.,"For life thou must look to the little crook,"
535,PART III.,Whereon doth hang thy trusty sword.
536,PART III.,
537,PART III.,"“The knobs on thy belt of tough, tough felt,"
538,PART III.,The foeman’s number will tell I ween;
539,PART III.,"Beware, I say, of Monk hoods grey"
540,PART III.,Concealing warriors stern and keen.”
541,PART III.,
542,PART III.,"To catch the maid the King essay’d,"
543,PART III.,His heart was bent yet more on learning;
544,PART III.,"Then slipped away the woodland fay,"
545,PART III.,Suddenly into vapour turning.
546,PART III.,
547,PART III.,As long as stay’d with him the maid
548,PART III.,"Both light and fire his sight did cheer,"
549,PART III.,"But as soon, as soon as she was gone"
550,PART III.,With Ranild he stood in the bush so drear.
551,PART III.,
552,PART III.,"Then the King for advice to Ranild cries,"
553,PART III.,And Ranild the traitor answer’d thus:
554,PART III.,"“From out this place our way we’ll trace,"
555,PART III.,For here no moon can shine on us.
556,PART III.,
557,PART III.,"“If I be right, a hamlet hight"
558,PART III.,Grey Tinderup not far doth lie;
559,PART III.,"This night we’d best in Tinderup rest,"
560,PART III.,"My liege, I think for a certainty."
561,PART III.,
562,PART III.,"“And thither we’ll ride, and there we’ll bide,"
563,PART III.,Until the moon has risen on high;
564,PART III.,By Mary’s might no mortal wight
565,PART III.,Will do thee any injury.”
566,PART III.,
567,PART III.,"So they ride away to Tinderup grey,"
568,PART III.,"And loud for lodging, lodging shout;"
569,PART III.,But they came so late that every gate
570,PART III.,"Was lock’d, and fires and lights put out."
571,PART III.,
572,PART III.,"Then their steeds they turn to Tinderup barn,"
573,PART III.,No mortal knew that they were there;
574,PART III.,To the King I wot the thought came not
575,PART III.,That he was now to his end so near.
576,PART III.,
577,PART III.,"But Erik’s breast was not at rest,"
578,PART III.,And thus to Ranild the lad he cried:
579,PART III.,"“O make the door both fast and sure,"
580,PART III.,I fast and sure in thee confide.
581,PART III.,
582,PART III.,"“Do thou the door with a stake secure,"
583,PART III.,I’ve ever found thee faithful yet;
584,PART III.,"In mind I hold that Stig is bold,"
585,PART III.,And oft I think upon his threat.”
586,PART III.,
587,PART III.,"“I’ve driven a pin the floor within,"
588,PART III.,And plac’d a balk against the door;
589,PART III.,By Mary bright no mortal wight
590,PART III.,To move that mighty balk has power.
591,PART III.,
592,PART III.,"“Marsk Stig is hot, I deny it not,"
593,PART III.,And wondrous words he thunders out;
594,PART III.,"But be of good cheer my master dear,"
595,PART III.,He o’er his table sits no doubt.
596,PART III.,
597,PART III.,“The lapwing bird each spot can guard
598,PART III.,"Upon the face of the verdant field,"
599,PART III.,Except alone the knoll whereon
600,PART III.,Its nest the bird is wont to build.”
601,PART III.,
602,PART III.,"No pin or stake did Ranild take,"
603,PART III.,He was I wean a lying cheat;
604,PART III.,"I tell to ye, for a verity,"
605,PART III.,He only took two straws of wheat.
606,PART III.,
607,PART III.,And for all his talk ’twas no thick balk
608,PART III.,"He plac’d for the door’s security,"
609,PART III.,But a wheat-sheaf light which the gust of night
610,PART III.,From the door removed instantly.
611,PART III.,
612,PART III.,"Scarce on the groun’ had they laid them down,"
613,PART III.,"On the groun’ of the barn so cold and hard,"
614,PART III.,"When of Ingeborg Dame the avengers came,"
615,PART III.,Spurring amain to the peasant’s gard.
616,PART III.,
617,PART III.,Into the yard came riding hard
618,PART III.,The fatal monks of orders grey;
619,PART III.,"No pause they made, to the place they sped"
620,PART III.,Where well they knew that the Monarch lay.
621,PART III.,
622,PART III.,"Upon the door their blows they shower,"
623,PART III.,With faulchion struck they and with spear;
624,PART III.,"“Come out, come out, Sir King,” they shout,"
625,PART III.,“The Dame has sent to greet thee here.”
626,PART III.,
627,PART III.,"To them in reply did Ranild cry,"
628,PART III.,And thus the Ranild youth began:
629,PART III.,"“No King is here, no King is near,"
630,PART III.,No King nor any such a man.”
631,PART III.,
632,PART III.,Then swift and fast Sir Ranild cast
633,PART III.,"Over his Lord both straw and hay,"
634,PART III.,But points with his hand to the in-rushing band
635,PART III.,The spot where the hapless Monarch lay.
636,PART III.,
637,PART III.,They extinguish’d straight the wax light great
638,PART III.,That burn’d the head of the Monarch o’er;
639,PART III.,"Then round the King they stood in a ring,"
640,PART III.,With blades athirst for his dearest gore.
641,PART III.,
642,PART III.,"“O Ranild hear, my servant dear,"
643,PART III.,"If thou wilt only fight for me,"
644,PART III.,"My sister bright to thee I’ll plight,"
645,PART III.,And she thy wedded wife shall be.”
646,PART III.,
647,PART III.,"Then he hew’d for his Lord on the broad, broad board,"
648,PART III.,And on the balk he hew’d so brave;
649,PART III.,"He hew’d hither, and he hew’d thither—"
650,PART III.,He fought for his master like a knave.
651,PART III.,
652,PART III.,"Full in the breast their stabs they address’d,"
653,PART III.,As near to the heart as well might be;
654,PART III.,"With wounds so sore, forty and more,"
655,PART III.,Miserably murder’d the King was he.
656,PART III.,
657,PART III.,"At him they bored with spear and sword,"
658,PART III.,No rest to him the Monks allow’d;
659,PART III.,"When done was the deed each took his steed,"
660,PART III.,And away with frantic fury rode.
661,PART III.,
662,PART III.,"This happ’d on the night of Cecily bright,"
663,PART III.,The season it was so bright and holy.
664,PART III.,"The King is dead, his blood is shed,"
665,PART III.,But Ingeborg still is melancholy.
666,PART III.,
667,PART III.,“Now who will bear to Viborg fair
668,PART III.,The corpse of the King across the green?
669,PART III.,And who will go with the tale of woe
670,PART III.,To Skanderborough where sits the Queen?”
671,PART III.,
672,PART III.,"Then ride would none to Viborg town,"
673,PART III.,And attend the corse across the green;
674,PART III.,"But rose up amain a little swain,"
675,PART III.,And he would ride to the Danish Queen.
676,PART III.,
677,PART III.,"Uprose amain the little swain,"
678,PART III.,And not long idle I ween he stay’d;
679,PART III.,"He tore from the grey the saddle away,"
680,PART III.,And that on the back of the white he laid.
681,PART III.,
682,PART III.,"“Hail gracious Queen so fair of mien,"
683,PART III.,Who sittest clad in scarlet red;
684,PART III.,"A traitorous train the King have slain,"
685,PART III.,In Tinderup barn he lieth dead.
686,PART III.,
687,PART III.,"“They stabbed him with might in his bosom white,"
688,PART III.,Their points came out of his royal side;
689,PART III.,"Take thou good care of the youthful heir,"
690,PART III.,Who Denmark’s realm is doomed to guide.
691,PART III.,
692,PART III.,"“Take heed, take heed of the land I rede,"
693,PART III.,And of this royal Castelaye;
694,PART III.,"’Bove every thing of the youthful King,"
695,PART III.,Who in after time shall Denmark sway.”
696,PART III.,
697,PART III.,"“Thou little lad thy tale is sad,"
698,PART III.,And it fills my heart with grief and pain;
699,PART III.,"But thee I’ll prize for thy advice,"
700,PART III.,And clothe and feed thee whilst I reign.”
701,PART III.,
702,PART III.,"It happ’d on the night of Cecily bright,"
703,PART III.,"In that sweet season blest and holy,"
704,PART III.,"Vengeance has sped, the King is dead—"
705,PART III.,But Ingeborg still is melancholy.
706,PART III.,
707,PART III.,
708,PART III.,
709,PART IV.,PART IV.
710,PART IV.,
711,PART IV.,
712,PART IV.,There were seven and seven times twenty
713,PART IV.,That met upon the verdant wold:
714,PART IV.,"“Say, what emprise shall we devise"
715,PART IV.,Now Denmark’s Lord is stark and cold?
716,PART IV.,
717,PART IV.,"“Our Lord we’ve slain, a corse he lies,"
718,PART IV.,The band of peace we thus have riven;
719,PART IV.,"Within the land we can make no stand,"
720,PART IV.,From land and friends we now are driven.
721,PART IV.,
722,PART IV.,"“But we will ride to Skanderborg,"
723,PART IV.,"And a visit to the Queen will pay,"
724,PART IV.,We’ll see how fares amid her cares
725,PART IV.,The Dame ere we depart for aye.
726,PART IV.,
727,PART IV.,"“It was her wont to jeer and scoff,"
728,PART IV.,But now therewith she must have done;
729,PART IV.,"The fire is come to the scorner’s home,"
730,PART IV.,And pity her I ween can none.”
731,PART IV.,
732,PART IV.,"Marsk Stig he into the saddle sprang,"
733,PART IV.,For his daring deed he felt no sorrow;
734,PART IV.,"He spurr’d his horse and bent his course,"
735,PART IV.,With his armed host to Skanderborough.
736,PART IV.,
737,PART IV.,"It was the Danish Queen so fine,"
738,PART IV.,She look’d from out the window high:
739,PART IV.,"“O there doth ride Marsk Stig,” she cried,"
740,PART IV.,“With his knight in iron panoply.
741,PART IV.,
742,PART IV.,"“Ha, welcome, Stig, thou self-made King,"
743,PART IV.,May’st quickly meet the guerdon due;
744,PART IV.,"If God doth spare the youthful heir,"
745,PART IV.,Full bitter fruit he’ll make thee chew.”
746,PART IV.,
747,PART IV.,"“Lady, I am no self-made King,"
748,PART IV.,Although it please thee so to say;
749,PART IV.,But I can name the knight of fame
750,PART IV.,"Who last with thee, fair lady, lay."
751,PART IV.,
752,PART IV.,"“Little thou mind’st King Erik’s death,"
753,PART IV.,"But briny tears thou soon wouldst shed,"
754,PART IV.,"If thou hadst lost the gallant Drost,"
755,PART IV.,Who’s wont at night to share thy bed.”
756,PART IV.,
757,PART IV.,“O shame upon the murderers foul
758,PART IV.,Who basely slew my lord and joy;
759,PART IV.,And shame befall both thee and all
760,PART IV.,My Queenly honour would destroy.”
761,PART IV.,
762,PART IV.,"Then up spoke Erik Erikson,"
763,PART IV.,The little King who was standing by:
764,PART IV.,“When I’m up-grown and bear the crown
765,PART IV.,Full quickly thou shalt Denmark fly.”
766,PART IV.,
767,PART IV.,"Then up stood little Christopher,"
768,PART IV.,And courage sparkled in his eye:
769,PART IV.,“To hang them all were vengeance small
770,PART IV.,For my dear father’s injury.”
771,PART IV.,
772,PART IV.,"“And if the land I’m forc’d to quit,"
773,PART IV.,"And upon the chilly billows lie,"
774,PART IV.,"I’ll work revenge and havoc strange,"
775,PART IV.,And mostly ’mong the great and high.
776,PART IV.,
777,PART IV.,"“And if from hence I’m forc’d to go,"
778,PART IV.,"And outlaw’d live in cave and wood,"
779,PART IV.,From Denmark’s land with spear and brand
780,PART IV.,Summer and Yule I’ll fetch me food.”
781,PART IV.,
782,PART IV.,"Then away from Skanderborg he rode,"
783,PART IV.,And his fist he shook against the towers;
784,PART IV.,"And with his troop to Molderup,"
785,PART IV.,"To seek his Ingeborg, he scours."
786,PART IV.,
787,PART IV.,"It was the young Sir Marshal Stig,"
788,PART IV.,He took his wife in his embrace;
789,PART IV.,“Now lieth slain the cursed bane
790,PART IV.,Of all our love and happiness.
791,PART IV.,
792,PART IV.,"“Now wilt thou brave stern poverty,"
793,PART IV.,And follow bold a man exil’d?
794,PART IV.,"Or wilt thou stay, and every day"
795,PART IV.,"Be harlot, Erik’s harlot, styl’d?”"
796,PART IV.,
797,PART IV.,“O could I even Queen become
798,PART IV.,The hated name I would not bear;
799,PART IV.,"My thanks, the best of this poor breast,"
800,PART IV.,For slaying him the ravisher.
801,PART IV.,
802,PART IV.,"“But we are allied to Counts and Knights,"
803,PART IV.,"And mighty men of high degree,"
804,PART IV.,"So do not fear the little heir,"
805,PART IV.,Nor for a child the country flee.
806,PART IV.,
807,PART IV.,"“Count Jacob of Halland, and Peter Pors,"
808,PART IV.,"Bluefod and Kagg, at any hour"
809,PART IV.,"Will back our cause, and sturdy Claus,"
810,PART IV.,"The Halland’sfar, and many more."
811,PART IV.,
812,PART IV.,"“There’s Erik King of Norroway,"
813,PART IV.,"To him your knightly hand extend,"
814,PART IV.,"For he a host and fleet can boast,"
815,PART IV.,And host and fleet he’ll gladly lend.
816,PART IV.,
817,PART IV.,“If thou upon the peak of Helm
818,PART IV.,"But build a castle strong and fast,"
819,PART IV.,"Thou need’st not quail for arrowy hail,"
820,PART IV.,Nor dread the engine’s deadly cast.
821,PART IV.,
822,PART IV.,"“And now for long, long winters nine"
823,PART IV.,I’ve hid my care within my breast;
824,PART IV.,"A worm gnaws sore my bosom’s core,"
825,PART IV.,"Good night, my Lord! I sink to rest.”"
826,PART IV.,
827,PART IV.,"Marsk Stig he took her in his arm,"
828,PART IV.,“The high God lengthen yet thy day!
829,PART IV.,Our best advice is now to prize
830,PART IV.,The hoary rocks of Norroway.”
831,PART IV.,
832,PART IV.,"Marsk Stig he speeds, to Helm proceeds,"
833,PART IV.,And soon inclos’d a fitting space;
834,PART IV.,"I tell to ye for verity,"
835,PART IV.,Before him palen’d many a face.
836,PART IV.,
837,PART IV.,"Marsk Stig he builds on Helm a keep,"
838,PART IV.,With massive walls and towers high;
839,PART IV.,"His raging foes besiege it close,"
840,PART IV.,"Germans and Danes, but vainly try."
841,PART IV.,
842,PART IV.,"Out into the field the peasant goes,"
843,PART IV.,And there the peasant sows his corn:
844,PART IV.,"“O God of might, what wondrous sight"
845,PART IV.,"The Helm, the Helm has got a horn!"
846,PART IV.,
847,PART IV.,"“O welladay on the poor boors grey,"
848,PART IV.,When Stig the Marshal’s bed was stain’d;
849,PART IV.,For us I ween it had better been
850,PART IV.,If Glepping had unborn remain’d.
851,PART IV.,
852,PART IV.,“Whene’er within the good green wood
853,PART IV.,"The oaks so mighty chance to fall,"
854,PART IV.,"They crush to the ground the hazels round,"
855,PART IV.,And all the other trees so small.
856,PART IV.,
857,PART IV.,“The sins of Kings and noblemen
858,PART IV.,Upon the poor fall heavily;
859,PART IV.,"God look with grace on the peasant’s case,"
860,PART IV.,And relieve him from his misery!”
