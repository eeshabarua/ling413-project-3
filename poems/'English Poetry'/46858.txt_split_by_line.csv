75,PREFATORY NOTE.,PREFATORY NOTE.
76,PREFATORY NOTE.,
77,PREFATORY NOTE.,
78,PREFATORY NOTE.,In the present edition of Crabbe's Poems the general arrangement
79,PREFATORY NOTE.,adopted is that of the chronological order of publication. The poem
80,PREFATORY NOTE.,entitled _Midnight_ has been inserted at a conjectural date as
81,PREFATORY NOTE.,belonging to the period of the Juvenile Poems (1772-1780); but all
82,PREFATORY NOTE.,other poems contained in this edition which have hitherto remained
83,PREFATORY NOTE.,"unpublished will be printed after the published poems, in the sequence"
84,PREFATORY NOTE.,of their production so far as this is ascertainable. With the poems
85,PREFATORY NOTE.,hitherto unpublished I have also been fortunate enough to obtain
86,PREFATORY NOTE.,"permission to include in a later volume, among other posthumously"
87,PREFATORY NOTE.,"printed pieces, the _Two Poetical Epistles_ by Crabbe, first"
88,PREFATORY NOTE.,"published, from a manuscript in the collection of Mr Buxton Forman, in"
89,PREFATORY NOTE.,Vol. II of _Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century_ edited by W.
90,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Robertson Nicoll and Thomas J. Wise (London, 1896). From the second of"
91,PREFATORY NOTE.,"these _Epistles_ were taken, but not in their original order, the ten"
92,PREFATORY NOTE.,lines reproduced in the present volume from George Crabbe the
93,PREFATORY NOTE.,younger's 1834 edition of his father's Poems.
94,PREFATORY NOTE.,
95,PREFATORY NOTE.,The earliest of the Juvenile Poems here printed are taken from _The
96,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Lady's Magazine, or Entertaining Companion for the Fair Sex,"
97,PREFATORY NOTE.,"appropriated solely to their Use and Amusement_, for the year 1772,"
98,PREFATORY NOTE.,"printed at London for Robinson and Roberts, 25 Paternoster Row. The"
99,PREFATORY NOTE.,first volume of this Magazine seems to have been that for the year
100,PREFATORY NOTE.,"1770, and to have comprised the numbers from August to December"
101,PREFATORY NOTE.,inclusive; but the earlier portion of this volume had been previously
102,PREFATORY NOTE.,published in the same year 1770 under the same title by J. Wheble at
103,PREFATORY NOTE.,"20 Paternoster Row, 'by whom letters to the Editor are requested and"
104,PREFATORY NOTE.,"received.' This then must be the 'Wheble's Magazine for 1772,' of"
105,PREFATORY NOTE.,which George Crabbe the younger in the Life prefixed to the 1834
106,PREFATORY NOTE.,edition of his father's Poems (p. 22) states that he had after long
107,PREFATORY NOTE.,search discovered a copy. The Magazine seems itself to have been a
108,PREFATORY NOTE.,"revival of an earlier _Lady's Magazine_, of which portions of the"
109,PREFATORY NOTE.,"volumes for 1760 and 1761 are extant, and which, according to the"
110,PREFATORY NOTE.,"title-page of the volume for 1761, was printed for J. Wilkie at the"
111,PREFATORY NOTE.,Bible in St Paul's Churchyard.
112,PREFATORY NOTE.,
113,PREFATORY NOTE.,But the younger Crabbe's account of his father's verses in 'Wheble's
114,PREFATORY NOTE.,Magazine for 1772' does not tally with the actual contents of the
115,PREFATORY NOTE.,volume for 1772 of _The Lady's Magazine_ which has been used for the
116,PREFATORY NOTE.,"present edition. It is possible, of course, though there is no"
117,PREFATORY NOTE.,"evidence to support the supposition, that _The Lady's Magazine_"
118,PREFATORY NOTE.,"published by Wheble was continued at all events till 1772, parallel to"
119,PREFATORY NOTE.,"_The Lady's Magazine_ published by Robinson and Roberts, with which in"
120,PREFATORY NOTE.,1770 it had been in some measure blended. It is equally possible that
121,PREFATORY NOTE.,"the younger Crabbe made some mistake or mistakes. In any case, his"
122,PREFATORY NOTE.,"statement is, that Wheble's Magazine for 1772 'contains besides the"
123,PREFATORY NOTE.,"prize poem on Hope,' from which he proceeds to quote the concluding"
124,PREFATORY NOTE.,"six lines, 'four other pieces, signed ""G. C., Woodbridge, Suffolk,"""
125,PREFATORY NOTE.,"""To Mira,"" ""The Atheist reclaimed,"" ""The Bee,"" and ""An Allegorical"
126,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Fable.""' The volume published by Robinson and Roberts contains no"
127,PREFATORY NOTE.,"pieces corresponding to these, except that in its October number"
128,PREFATORY NOTE.,"there is printed an _Essay on Hope_, in which the lines cited by the"
129,PREFATORY NOTE.,"younger Crabbe and reprinted, on his authority, in the present"
130,PREFATORY NOTE.,"edition, do not appear, but of which the concluding lines seem to"
131,PREFATORY NOTE.,imply that it was a copy of verses written in competition for a prize.
132,PREFATORY NOTE.,"It cannot however be by Crabbe. For it is signed 'C. C., Rotherhithe,"
133,PREFATORY NOTE.,1772'; and the July number of the same volume contains a piece of
134,PREFATORY NOTE.,verse of some length entitled _The Rotherhithe Beauties_ and signed
135,PREFATORY NOTE.,"'C. C., Rotherhithe, July 15,' which is certainly not by Crabbe; and"
136,PREFATORY NOTE.,"later in the volume follows another piece entitled _Night_, signed 'C."
137,PREFATORY NOTE.,"C., Rotherhithe, November 19, 1772,' which likewise cannot be"
138,PREFATORY NOTE.,attributed to Crabbe.
139,PREFATORY NOTE.,
140,PREFATORY NOTE.,On the other hand the 1772 volume of _The Lady's Magazine_ contains
141,PREFATORY NOTE.,certain pieces of verse which may without hesitation be assigned to
142,PREFATORY NOTE.,"him, and which are accordingly reprinted in the present edition. These"
143,PREFATORY NOTE.,"are, in the September number, _Solitude_ and _A Song_, which bear as a"
144,PREFATORY NOTE.,"signature the quasi-anagram 'G. EBBARE'; in the October number, the"
145,PREFATORY NOTE.,"lines _To Emma_, with the quasi-anagram 'G. EBBAAC' and the date"
146,PREFATORY NOTE.,"'Suffolk'; and, in the November number, _Despair_, _Cupid_, and a"
147,PREFATORY NOTE.,"_Song_, signed with the earlier form 'G. EBBARE.' This _Song_ is"
148,PREFATORY NOTE.,"followed by some lines in blank verse _On the Wonders of Creation_,"
149,PREFATORY NOTE.,"and, further on, by some stanzas _To Friendship_, likewise signed 'C."
150,PREFATORY NOTE.,C.'; but manifestly neither blank verse nor stanzas are by Crabbe.
151,PREFATORY NOTE.,
152,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Finally, it should be noted that in the October number in the same"
153,PREFATORY NOTE.,volume the following occurs among the notices _To our Correspondents_:
154,PREFATORY NOTE.,"'The birth of a Maccaroni, by Ebbare, in the style of the Scriptures,"
155,PREFATORY NOTE.,seems to be taking too great a liberty with things sacred; and it is
156,PREFATORY NOTE.,"our maxim, as far as possible, to abstain from every appearance of"
157,PREFATORY NOTE.,evil.' The _Lady's Magazine_ continued to be published by Robinson
158,PREFATORY NOTE.,and Roberts for many subsequent years; and it is a curious coincidence
159,PREFATORY NOTE.,"that No. 5 of Vol. XLVII (for May, 1816) contains some stanzas"
160,PREFATORY NOTE.,entitled _Myra's Wedding-Day_.
161,PREFATORY NOTE.,
162,PREFATORY NOTE.,The remaining _Juvenilia_ printed in the present edition are partly
163,PREFATORY NOTE.,"reproduced from the _Fragments of Verse, from Mr Crabbe's early"
164,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Note-Books_ in Vol. II of the 1834 edition, partly from the Life in"
165,PREFATORY NOTE.,Vol. I of the same. The lines On the Death of William Springall Levett
166,PREFATORY NOTE.,"are quoted in the latter from Green's _History of Framlingham_, which"
167,PREFATORY NOTE.,has been compared.
168,PREFATORY NOTE.,
169,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Of the poems which follow in the present volume, _Inebriety_ is here"
170,PREFATORY NOTE.,"printed from a copy of the quarto of 1775, which lacks a title-page"
171,PREFATORY NOTE.,and which bears on p. 1 the following deprecation in Crabbe's
172,PREFATORY NOTE.,handwriting: 'NB.--pray let not this be seen at [cipher] there is very
173,PREFATORY NOTE.,little of it that I'm not heartily asham'd of.' The imprint of the
174,PREFATORY NOTE.,"title-page here given is taken from the _Life_ (1834, p. 28)."
175,PREFATORY NOTE.,
176,PREFATORY NOTE.,"_Midnight, a Poem_, is now first printed from the original manuscript"
177,PREFATORY NOTE.,"which formed part of Dawson Turner's collection, in which it was"
178,PREFATORY NOTE.,"numbered 121 at the sale of Dawson Turner's manuscripts in June, 1859."
179,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Its handwriting, as Professor Dowden points out, is identical with"
180,PREFATORY NOTE.,that of a _facsimile_ in a passage from the _Two Epistles_ mentioned
181,PREFATORY NOTE.,"above, given in the _Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century_."
182,PREFATORY NOTE.,
183,PREFATORY NOTE.,"_The Candidate_ is printed from the edition of 1834 (Vol. II,"
184,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Appendix). This poem is not included in the edition of 1823, and after"
185,PREFATORY NOTE.,a long quest it has proved impossible to obtain a copy of the original
186,PREFATORY NOTE.,"edition of 1780 (published in quarto by H. Payne, opposite Marlborough"
187,PREFATORY NOTE.,"House, Pall Mall). This edition is not in the British Museum. It was"
188,PREFATORY NOTE.,only possible to compare the forty-six lines of the poem quoted in
189,PREFATORY NOTE.,"_The Monthly Review_ for September, 1780; but no variants have been"
190,PREFATORY NOTE.,found in these.
191,PREFATORY NOTE.,
192,PREFATORY NOTE.,The subsequent poems contained in the present volume are all printed
193,PREFATORY NOTE.,"from the edition of 1823, the last edition published in England in the"
194,PREFATORY NOTE.,poet's lifetime. The _Variants_ enumerated at the close of this volume
195,PREFATORY NOTE.,are in each case the readings of the first editions of the several
196,PREFATORY NOTE.,"poems, viz., _The Library_, 1781, _The Village_, 1783, _The"
197,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Newspaper_, 1785, _The Parish Register &c._, 1807, and _The Borough_,"
198,PREFATORY NOTE.,"1810. The address _To the Reader_ prefixed to _The Newspaper_, which"
199,PREFATORY NOTE.,"does not appear in the edition of 1823, has been restored from that of"
200,PREFATORY NOTE.,"1785, as it appears in the younger Crabbe's edition of 1834."
201,PREFATORY NOTE.,
202,PREFATORY NOTE.,"The list of _Errata_ includes all the misprints, slips of the pen, and"
203,PREFATORY NOTE.,"unintentional mistakes of spelling or quotation, which have been found"
204,PREFATORY NOTE.,in the texts which have been reprinted in this volume. The reading
205,PREFATORY NOTE.,substituted here is in each case enclosed in square brackets. The list
206,PREFATORY NOTE.,"is a long one, for Crabbe was a careless writer; and in the matter of"
207,PREFATORY NOTE.,quotations (as the concluding sentence of the _Preface_ to _The
208,PREFATORY NOTE.,Borough_ indicates) was not given to over-conscientiousness. It has
209,PREFATORY NOTE.,"seemed permissible, where this could be done, to supplement the poet's"
210,PREFATORY NOTE.,statements as to the sources of his quotations; but there are
211,PREFATORY NOTE.,instances in which these statements themselves remain more or less
212,PREFATORY NOTE.,"doubtful. Crabbe's interpunctuation is so arbitrary, and, though no"
213,PREFATORY NOTE.,doubt largely determined by what might be described as the movement of
214,PREFATORY NOTE.,"the writer's mind, so frequently at variance even with the practice"
215,PREFATORY NOTE.,"(it can hardly be called system) which he more usually follows, that"
216,PREFATORY NOTE.,it has been thought right to use as much freedom on this head as
217,PREFATORY NOTE.,seemed consistent with a due respect for the author's intention. No
218,PREFATORY NOTE.,alteration has been made in the matter of interpunctuation which was
219,PREFATORY NOTE.,"not warranted either by the poet's ordinary practice, or by the"
220,PREFATORY NOTE.,primary necessity of making his meaning clear.
221,PREFATORY NOTE.,
222,PREFATORY NOTE.,"As complete as possible a bibliography of Crabbe's Poems will, it is"
223,PREFATORY NOTE.,"hoped, be published in the concluding volume of this edition."
224,PREFATORY NOTE.,
225,PREFATORY NOTE.,There remains the pleasant duty of thanking those whose kindness has
226,PREFATORY NOTE.,been of assistance in the preparation of this volume. The relatives of
227,PREFATORY NOTE.,my dear friend the late Canon AINGER have allowed me to retain for
228,PREFATORY NOTE.,this purpose the first editions of _Inebriety_ (with Crabbe's
229,PREFATORY NOTE.,"autograph), _The Village_ and _The Newspaper_ which he had lent me not"
230,PREFATORY NOTE.,"long before his death. The Vice-Master of Trinity, Mr W. ALDIS WRIGHT,"
231,PREFATORY NOTE.,besides enabling me to borrow from Trinity Library the first edition
232,PREFATORY NOTE.,"of _The Library_, kindly lent his own copy of the _Poems_ published in"
233,PREFATORY NOTE.,"1807. I am indebted to Professor EDWARD DOWDEN, LL.D., of Trinity"
234,PREFATORY NOTE.,"College, Dublin, for various services generously rendered by him to"
235,PREFATORY NOTE.,"this edition of Crabbe, which will benefit from them in its concluding"
236,PREFATORY NOTE.,as it has in its opening volume. He has readily allowed me to print
237,PREFATORY NOTE.,"the whole of the interesting blank verse poem of _Midnight_, which, in"
238,PREFATORY NOTE.,"his own words, 'unless it be a transcript by Crabbe from some other"
239,PREFATORY NOTE.,"eighteenth-century poet, of which there is no evidence, may be assumed"
240,PREFATORY NOTE.,to be of his authorship.'
241,PREFATORY NOTE.,
242,PREFATORY NOTE.,"To the same kind friend, and to the special courtesy of Mr J. W."
243,PREFATORY NOTE.,"LYSTER, Librarian of the National Library of Ireland, Kildare Street,"
244,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Dublin, I owe the opportunity of tracing _fide oculata_, so far as it"
245,PREFATORY NOTE.,"seems possible to make sure of it, the elusive volume of _The Lady's"
246,PREFATORY NOTE.,Magazine_ containing the earliest of Crabbe's printed verse.
247,PREFATORY NOTE.,
248,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Mr A. R. WALLER, of Peterhouse, Assistant Secretary to the Syndics of"
249,PREFATORY NOTE.,"the University Press, has in many ways facilitated the preparation of"
250,PREFATORY NOTE.,this volume. And without the unstinting and unflagging cooperation of
251,PREFATORY NOTE.,"another member of my College, Mr A. T. BARTHOLOMEW, of the University"
252,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Library, who has compiled the list of variants, besides giving me much"
253,PREFATORY NOTE.,"other assistance, I could not, amidst other engagements, have carried"
254,PREFATORY NOTE.,so far the execution of a delightful task.

703,INEBRIETY.,
704,INEBRIETY.,Presumption or Meanness are but too often the only articles to be
705,INEBRIETY.,discovered in a Preface. Whilst one author haughtily affects to
706,INEBRIETY.,"despise the public attention, another timidly courts it. I would no"
707,INEBRIETY.,"more beg for than disdain applause, and therefore should advance"
708,INEBRIETY.,"nothing in Favor of the following little _Poem_, did it not appear a"
709,INEBRIETY.,Cruelty and disregard to send a first Production naked into the WORLD.
710,INEBRIETY.,
711,INEBRIETY.,"The WORLD!--how pompous, and yet how trifling the sound. Every MAN,"
712,INEBRIETY.,"Gentle Reader, has a WORLD of his own, & whether it consists of half a"
713,INEBRIETY.,"score, or half a thousand Friends, 'tis his, and he loves to boast of"
714,INEBRIETY.,"it. Into my WORLD, therefore, I commit this, my Muse's earliest labor,"
715,INEBRIETY.,"nothing doubting the Clemency of the Climate, nor fearing the"
716,INEBRIETY.,Partiality of the censorious.
717,INEBRIETY.,
718,INEBRIETY.,"Something by way of _Apology_ for this trifle, is perhaps necessary;"
719,INEBRIETY.,"especially for those parts, wherein I have taken such great Liberties"
720,INEBRIETY.,"with Mr. POPE; that Gentleman, secure in immortal Fame, would forgive"
721,INEBRIETY.,"me; forgive me too, my friendly Critic; I promise thee, thou wilt find"
722,INEBRIETY.,the Extracts from the Swan of Thames the best Parts of the
723,INEBRIETY.,"Performance; Few, I dare venture to affirm, will pay me so great a"
724,INEBRIETY.,"Compliment, as to think I have injured Mr POPE; Fewer, I hope, will"
725,INEBRIETY.,"think I endeavoured to do it, and Fewest of all will think any thing"
726,INEBRIETY.,about it.
727,INEBRIETY.,
728,INEBRIETY.,The LADIES will doubtless favor my Attempt; for them indeed it was
729,INEBRIETY.,principally composed; I have endeavored to demonstrate that it is
730,INEBRIETY.,"their own Faults, if they are not deemed as good MEN, as half the"
731,INEBRIETY.,masculine World; that a personal Difference of Sex need not make a
732,INEBRIETY.,"real Difference; and that a tender Languishment, a refin'd Delicacy,"
733,INEBRIETY.,"and a particular attention to shine in Dress, will render the"
734,INEBRIETY.,"_Beau-Animal_ infinitely more feminine, than the generality of LADIES,"
735,INEBRIETY.,whatever arcane Tokens of _Manhood_ the said _Animal_ may be indued
736,INEBRIETY.,"with; and yet, ye FAIR! these creatures pass even in your catalogue"
737,INEBRIETY.,for MEN; which I'm afraid is a Demonstration that the real MAN is very
738,INEBRIETY.,scarce.
739,INEBRIETY.,
740,INEBRIETY.,"Some grave _Head_ or _other_ may possibly tell me, that Vice is to be"
741,INEBRIETY.,"lash'd, not indulg'd; that true _Poetry_ forbids, not encourages,"
742,INEBRIETY.,"Folly; and such other wise and weighty Sentences, picked from POPE and"
743,INEBRIETY.,"HORACE, as he shall think most appertaining to his own dignity. But"
744,INEBRIETY.,"this, my good Reader, is a trifle; _People_ now a Days are not to be"
745,INEBRIETY.,"preach'd into Reflection, or they pay _Parsons_, not _Poets_ for it,"
746,INEBRIETY.,"if they were; they listen indeed to a Discourse from the Pulpit, for"
747,INEBRIETY.,MEN are too wise to give away their Money without any consideration;
748,INEBRIETY.,"and though they don't mind what is said there, 'tis doubtless a great"
749,INEBRIETY.,Satisfaction to think they might if they choose it; but a MAN reads a
750,INEBRIETY.,_Poem_ for quite a different purpose: to be lul'd into ease from
751,INEBRIETY.,"reflection, to be lul'd into an inclination for pleasure, and (where I"
752,INEBRIETY.,confess it comes nearer the Sermon) to be lul'd--asleep.

1226,HORACE.,
1227,HORACE.,"Now soar, my Muse! and leave the meaner crew[5],"
1228,HORACE.,"To aim at bliss, and vainly bliss pursue;"
1229,HORACE.,"Let us (since Man no privilege can claim,"
1230,HORACE.,"Than a contended, half superior name)"
1231,HORACE.,"Expatiate o'er the raptures of the Fair,"
1232,HORACE.,"Vot'ries to stolen joys, but yet sincere;"
1233,HORACE.,"In secret Haunts, where never day-light gleams"
1234,HORACE.,"By bottles, tempting with forbidden streams,"
1235,HORACE.,"Together let us search; above, below,"
1236,HORACE.,"Try what the Closets, what the Cellars show;                        10"
1237,HORACE.,The latent vault with piercing view explore
1238,HORACE.,Of her who hides the all reviving store.
1239,HORACE.,"Eye Beauty's walks, when round the welkin rolls,"
1240,HORACE.,And catch the stumbling Charmer as she falls;
1241,HORACE.,"Laugh where we must, but pity where we can,"
1242,HORACE.,And vindicate the sweet soft souls to Man.
1243,HORACE.,
1244,HORACE.,"Pardon, ye Fair, the Poet and his Muse,"
1245,HORACE.,"And what ye can't approve, at least excuse;"
1246,HORACE.,"Far be from him the iron lash of Wit,"
1247,HORACE.,"The jokes of Humour, and the sneers that hit;                       20"
1248,HORACE.,"He speaks of Freedom, and he speaks to you,"
1249,HORACE.,"His Verse is simple, but his Subject new;"
1250,HORACE.,"And novelty, ye Fair, beyond a doubt,"
1251,HORACE.,"Is philosophic truth, the World throughout."
1252,HORACE.,
1253,HORACE.,"Hard is the lot of Woman, so have sung"
1254,HORACE.,"The pensive old, and the presuming young;"
1255,HORACE.,"Born without privilege, in bondage bred,"
1256,HORACE.,Slave from the Cradle to the marriage Bed;
1257,HORACE.,"Slave from the hour hymeneal to the grave,"
1258,HORACE.,"In age, in youth, in infancy a Slave.                               30"
1259,HORACE.,"Happy the Bard, who, bold in pride of song"
1260,HORACE.,"Shall free the chain, by Custom bound so long,"
1261,HORACE.,"And show the Fair, to mean tradition prone,"
1262,HORACE.,"Though Virtue may have sex, yet Vice has none."
1263,HORACE.,"If Man is licenc'd to confuse his mind,"
1264,HORACE.,"Say, why should female Frailty be confin'd?"

1266,HORACE.,"Of all our wayward appetites the root,                               }"

1268,HORACE.,"Who fair in spells of tender kind can slay,                         40"
1269,HORACE.,"Like Israel's Judge, her thousands in a day;"
1270,HORACE.,"Nay farther, has a far superior Pow'r,"
1271,HORACE.,And almost thousands in a day can cure;
1272,HORACE.,"She, the bright cause of fury in Man's breast;"
1273,HORACE.,And brighter cause who bids that fury rest;
1274,HORACE.,"Who raises peace or war at her command,"
1275,HORACE.,And bids a sword destroy a tipsy Land;
1276,HORACE.,"Say, is it right that she who kills and saves,"

1283,HORACE.,"To put the human off, and loose his Name?"
1284,HORACE.,"Woman in Knowledge was the earlier curst,"
1285,HORACE.,And tasted of forbidden Fruit the first;
1286,HORACE.,"Prior to Man, the law she disobey'd,"
1287,HORACE.,And shall she want the Freedom she convey'd?
1288,HORACE.,"By her first Theft each fiery ill we feel,                          60"
1289,HORACE.,And yet compel the gen'rous Fair to steal;
1290,HORACE.,"First made by her for soaring actions fit,"
1291,HORACE.,"Woman! the spring of super-human wit,"
1292,HORACE.,"Shall we from her each dear bought bliss withhold,"
1293,HORACE.,As Spaniards use the Indians for their Gold?
1294,HORACE.,"Ungrateful Man! in pride so high to aim,"
1295,HORACE.,As to be sole inheritor of shame!
1296,HORACE.,
1297,HORACE.,"And you, ye Fair! why slumber on disdain,"
1298,HORACE.,"Forbear to vindicate, yet can't refrain?"
1299,HORACE.,"Why should Papilla seek the vaulted hoard,                          70"
1300,HORACE.,And but in secret ape her honest Lord?
1301,HORACE.,"Why should'st thou, Celia, to thy stores repair,"
1302,HORACE.,And sip the generous Spirit in such fear?
1303,HORACE.,"Reform the Error, and revoke your plan,"
1304,HORACE.,"And as ye dare to imitate, be----Man."
1305,HORACE.,
1306,HORACE.,"First know yourselves, and frame your passions all[6],"
1307,HORACE.,"In proper order, how to rise and fall;"
1308,HORACE.,"Woman's a Being, dubiously great,"
1309,HORACE.,Never contented with a passive state;
1310,HORACE.,"With too much Knowledge to give Man the sway,                       80"
1311,HORACE.,"With too much Pride his humours to obey,"
1312,HORACE.,"She hangs in doubt, [too] humble or [too] brave;"
1313,HORACE.,In doubt to be a Mistress or a Slave;
1314,HORACE.,In doubt herself or Husband to controul;
1315,HORACE.,Born to be made a tyrant or a fool;
1316,HORACE.,"In one extreme, her Power is always such"
1317,HORACE.,"Either to show too little, or too much;"
1318,HORACE.,"Bred up in Passions, by their sway abus'd,"
1319,HORACE.,The weaker for the stronger still refus'd;
1320,HORACE.,"Created oft' to rise, and oft' to fall,                             90"
1321,HORACE.,"Changing in all things, yet alike in all;"
1322,HORACE.,"Soft Judge of right or wrong, or blest or curst,"
1323,HORACE.,"The happiest, saddest, holiest, or the worst."
1324,HORACE.,
1325,HORACE.,"And why? because your failings ye suppress,"
1326,HORACE.,"And what ye dare to act, dare not confess."
1327,HORACE.,"Would you, ye Fair, as Man your vices boast,"
1328,HORACE.,"And she be most admir'd, who sins the most;"
1329,HORACE.,"Would ye in open revel gaily spring,"
1330,HORACE.,And o'er the wanton Banquet vaunting sing;
1331,HORACE.,"The doubtful Precedence we then should own,                        100"
1332,HORACE.,And you be first in [Error's] mazes known.
1333,HORACE.,
1334,HORACE.,But why to Vices of the boist'rous kind
1335,HORACE.,"Tye the soft Soul, and urge the gentle Mind?"
1336,HORACE.,"Forbid it, Nature! to the Fair I speak,"
1337,HORACE.,"By her made strong, by Custom rendered weak;"
1338,HORACE.,"Whose passions, trembling for unbounded sway,"
1339,HORACE.,"Will thank the Bard, who points the nearest way;"
1340,HORACE.,"All Vice through Folly's regions first should pass,"
1341,HORACE.,And Folly holds her sceptre o'er the glass.
1342,HORACE.,"Drink then, ye Fair! and nature's laws fulfill;                    110"
1343,HORACE.,"Be ev'ry thing at once, and all ye will;"
1344,HORACE.,Put off the mask that hides the Sex's claim
1345,HORACE.,And makes Distinction but an empty name.
1346,HORACE.,
1347,HORACE.,"Go, wond'rous Creature! where the potion glides[7]"
1348,HORACE.,From Bowls unmeasured in illumin'd tides;
1349,HORACE.,"Instruct each other, in your due degrees;"
1350,HORACE.,"Correct old Rules, and be e'en what you please;"
1351,HORACE.,"Go, drink! for who shall jointed power contest?"
1352,HORACE.,"Drink to the passable, the good, the best."
1353,HORACE.,"And, quitting Custom and her idle plan,                            120"
1354,HORACE.,Call drowning reason imitating Man;
1355,HORACE.,"Like lovers' brains in giddy circles run,"
1356,HORACE.,"And, all exhausting, imitate the Sun;"
1357,HORACE.,"Go, and be Man in noise and glorious strife,"
1358,HORACE.,Then drop into his Arms and be a----Wife.
1359,HORACE.,
1360,HORACE.,"Ye Gods! what scenes upon my Fancy press,"
1361,HORACE.,The Consequence of unconfin'd excess;
1362,HORACE.,"When Vice in common has one general name,"
1363,HORACE.,And male and female Errors be the same;
1364,HORACE.,"For, as the strength of Spirit none contest,                       130"
1365,HORACE.,That daring Ill shall introduce the rest;
1366,HORACE.,"Then, what a field of glory will arise,"
1367,HORACE.,"What dazzling scenes, ye Fair, before your eyes:"
1368,HORACE.,"As female duels, Jockies----what besides?"
1369,HORACE.,"Gamblers in petticoats, and booted brides;"
1370,HORACE.,"The tender Billet to the gentle swain,"
1371,HORACE.,That boldly dares avouch the am'rous pain;
1372,HORACE.,"Soft Beaux intreated, gentle Coxcombs prest,"
1373,HORACE.,And Fops asham'd half blush to be addrest.
1374,HORACE.,"Thus to sweet Strephon will his Chloris say,                       140"
1375,HORACE.,One cup of Nectar having pav'd the way;
1376,HORACE.,"""Oh! why so dead to my emploring eyes,"
1377,HORACE.,"Deaf to my prayer, and speechless to my sighs?"
1378,HORACE.,"Sure never Nymph of old, my darling Boy,"
1379,HORACE.,"When Men intreated, and when we were coy,"
1380,HORACE.,"Was prest so warmly by a bleeding swain,"
1381,HORACE.,"Or shot from killing eyes such cold disdain."""
1382,HORACE.,"And thus will run wild Flavia's Billetdoux,"
1383,HORACE.,"The writing bold, and e'en the spelling true:"
1384,HORACE.,"""No more, my Belmour, shun these longing arms,                     150"
1385,HORACE.,Thou quintessence of all thy Sex's charms;
1386,HORACE.,"At ten--behind the elm, where echoes sigh,"
1387,HORACE.,"Shall, taught [by] me, teach thee my swain to die;"
1388,HORACE.,"The conscious Moon shall fill her lucid horn,"
1389,HORACE.,And join thy Blush to mock the crimson morn;
1390,HORACE.,"The limpid Stream shall softly move along,"
1391,HORACE.,And hear its own sweet warble from thy tongue;
1392,HORACE.,"There come, dear boy, or vainly flow the streams,"
1393,HORACE.,"There come, or vainly sheds the moon her beams;"
1394,HORACE.,"Vainly on her my Moments I shall waste,                            160"
1395,HORACE.,"She who like thee is cold, and who like thee is chaste."""
1396,HORACE.,But then what tender Stripling shall escape?
1397,HORACE.,What blushing Boy avoid a Lady-Rape?
1398,HORACE.,"Where shall each lisping creature hide his head,"
1399,HORACE.,To amazonian desires betray'd?
1400,HORACE.,"Where from the wily Heroine remove,"
1401,HORACE.,Clad in the fortitude of Wine and Love?
1402,HORACE.,"Oh! hapless Lad, what refuge canst thou find"
1403,HORACE.,"Too soft, too mild, too tender to be kind?"
1404,HORACE.,"Yet this is no objection understood,                               170"
1405,HORACE.,"""For partial Evil's universal Good."""
1406,HORACE.,
1407,HORACE.,Nor think of Nature's state I make a jest[8]:
1408,HORACE.,The state of Nature is a state undrest;
1409,HORACE.,"The love of Pleasure at our birth began,"
1410,HORACE.,"Pleasure the aim of all things, and of Man."
1411,HORACE.,"Law then was not, the swelling flame to kill,"
1412,HORACE.,"Man walk'd with beast, and--so he always will;"
1413,HORACE.,"And Woman too, the same their board and bed,"
1414,HORACE.,"And would be now, but Folks are better bred;"
1415,HORACE.,"In some convenient grot, or tufted wood,                           180"
1416,HORACE.,All human beings Nature's circuit trod;
1417,HORACE.,"The shrine was her's, with no gay vesture laid;"
1418,HORACE.,"Unbrib'd, unmarried stood the willing maid;"
1419,HORACE.,"Her attribute was universal Love,"
1420,HORACE.,And man's prerogative to range and rove.
1421,HORACE.,"But how unlike the Pairs of times to come,"
1422,HORACE.,"Wedded, yet separate, abroad at home,"
1423,HORACE.,"Who foes to Nature, and to evil prone,"
1424,HORACE.,"Despising all, but hating most their own."
1425,HORACE.,"A wayward craving this Neglect succeeds,                           190"
1426,HORACE.,As every Monster monst'rous children breeds;
1427,HORACE.,"Strange motly passions from this vice began,"
1428,HORACE.,And Man unnatural turn'd to worship Man.
1429,HORACE.,
1430,HORACE.,"For this the Muse now calls the Fair to rise,"
1431,HORACE.,"To shew our failings, and to make us wise;"
1432,HORACE.,"Be now to Bacchus, now to Venus prone,"
1433,HORACE.,And share each folly Man has thought his own;
1434,HORACE.,"Shame him from Vice, by shewing him your shame,"
1435,HORACE.,"And part with yours, to reinstate his Fame;"
1436,HORACE.,"Be generously vile, and this your view:                            200"
1437,HORACE.,That Man may hate his errors seen in you.
1438,HORACE.,
1439,HORACE.,"Say, when the Coxcomb flatters and adores,"
1440,HORACE.,When (taking snuff) your pity he implores;
1441,HORACE.,"With many a gentle Dem'me swears to die,"
1442,HORACE.,And humbly begs Destruction from your eye;
1443,HORACE.,"When your own arts he takes, and speaks in smiles,"
1444,HORACE.,"With Softness woos, and with a Voice beguiles;"
1445,HORACE.,"Does it not move your pity and disdain,"
1446,HORACE.,"Such flow'ry passion, and such mincing pain;"
1447,HORACE.,"Your various Follies you with anger scan,                          210"
1448,HORACE.,So shewn by one whom Nature meant for Man.
1449,HORACE.,"E'en so do we our faults in you despise,"
1450,HORACE.,And Vice has double malice in those Eyes.
1451,HORACE.,"When Chloe toasts her Beau, or raves too loud;"
1452,HORACE.,"When Flavia leaves her home, and joins a croud;"
1453,HORACE.,"When Silvia fearless rolls the roguish eye,"
1454,HORACE.,And Damon's want of confidence supply;
1455,HORACE.,"When betts, and duns, and every rougher name,"
1456,HORACE.,Sound in the ear of either Sex the same;
1457,HORACE.,"How should we tell, when thus you love and hate,                   220"
1458,HORACE.,"Who acts the Man, and who's effeminate?"
1459,HORACE.,
1460,HORACE.,"Drink, then! disclaim your Sex, be Man in all,"
1461,HORACE.,"Shew us at once, distinction ought to fall;"
1462,HORACE.,"And from the humble things ye were of old,"
1463,HORACE.,Be reeling Cæsars in a cyprian mould.
1464,HORACE.,
1465,HORACE.,"Better for us, 'tis granted, it might be[9],"
1466,HORACE.,"Were you all Softness, and all Honour we;"
1467,HORACE.,That never rougher Passion mov'd your mind;
1468,HORACE.,That we were all or excellent or blind;
1469,HORACE.,"But, as we now subsist by passions strife,                         230"
1470,HORACE.,"Which are (POPE writes) the elements of life,"
1471,HORACE.,"The general order, since the whole began,"
1472,HORACE.,"Should be dissolv'd, and Manners make the Man."
1473,HORACE.,
1474,HORACE.,"Nor fear, if once ye break through general Laws,"
1475,HORACE.,"To draw in thousands, and gain our applause;"
1476,HORACE.,"Nor fear but Fame your merits shall make known,"
1477,HORACE.,And female Bravos trample Hectors down;
1478,HORACE.,"From Man himself you'll learn the art he boasts,"
1479,HORACE.,"Rule in his room, and govern in his posts."
1480,HORACE.,
1481,HORACE.,Thus does the Muse in vein didactic speak----[10]                240
1482,HORACE.,"""Go, from proud Man thy full instructions take;"

1488,HORACE.,"Shake the mad room, and revel in excess;"
1489,HORACE.,"From Man all forms of grand deception find,"
1490,HORACE.,And so be tempted to delude Mankind.
1491,HORACE.,Here frantic schemes of wild Ambition see;                         250
1492,HORACE.,"There all the plots, my Fair! he lays for thee."
1493,HORACE.,"Learn each small People's genius, humours, aims,"
1494,HORACE.,"The Jocky's dealing, and Newmarket games;"
1495,HORACE.,"How there in common wealth in currents go,"
1496,HORACE.,And poverty and riches ebb and flow;
1497,HORACE.,"And these for ever, though a Saint deny'd,"
1498,HORACE.,To splendour or contempt their Masters guide;
1499,HORACE.,"Mark the nice rules of modern honour well,"
1500,HORACE.,Rules which the laws of Nature far excel.
1501,HORACE.,In vain thy fancy finer whims shall draw;                          260
1502,HORACE.,"Good-breeding is as difficult as Law,"
1503,HORACE.,"And, form'd so complex, makes itself a science,"
1504,HORACE.,To bid the Scholar and the Clown defiance.
1505,HORACE.,"Go then, and thus thy present Lords survey,"
1506,HORACE.,And let the Creatures feel they must obey;
1507,HORACE.,"Learn all their Arts, be these thy choicest hoard,"
1508,HORACE.,"Be fear'd for these, and be for these ador'd."""

1512,HORACE.,"From thence we trace the horrors of a War,                         270"
1513,HORACE.,"Chaotic counsel, ministerial jar;"
1514,HORACE.,"This makes a gambling Lord, a Patriot vain,"
1515,HORACE.,"The Soldier's fury, and the Lover's pain;"
1516,HORACE.,Fills Bedlam's wards with souls of ærial mould;
1517,HORACE.,"This makes the Madman, this supplies the Scold;"
1518,HORACE.,"Here rules the one grand Passion in extreme,"
1519,HORACE.,"A love of lucre, or a love of fame;"

1523,HORACE.,"Oh! happy fall of insolence and pride,                           280"
1524,HORACE.,Which makes the humblest with the great allied;
1525,HORACE.,"Which levels like the Grave all earthly things,"
1526,HORACE.,For drunken Coblers are as proud as Kings;
1527,HORACE.,"Which plucks the sons of grandeur from their sphere,"

3534,"MY LORD,","your Lordship's right honourable and ever-valued relation, Mr. FOX;"
3535,"MY LORD,",that it should be the last which engaged his attention; and that some
3536,"MY LORD,",parts of it were marked with his approbation: are circumstances

3538,"MY LORD,",entertain before I was gratified with a knowledge of them; and the
3539,"MY LORD,",hope thus raised leads me to ask permission that I may dedicate this
3540,"MY LORD,","book to your Lordship, to whom that truly great and greatly lamented"
3541,"MY LORD,","personage was so nearly allied in family, so closely bound in"
3542,"MY LORD,","affection, and in whose mind presides the same critical taste which he"
3543,"MY LORD,",exerted to the delight of all who heard him. He doubtless united with
3544,"MY LORD,",his unequalled abilities a fund of good-nature; and this possibly led
3545,"MY LORD,","him to speak favourably of, and give satisfaction to writers, with"
3546,"MY LORD,",whose productions he might not be entirely satisfied; nor must I allow
3547,"MY LORD,","myself to suppose his desire of obliging was withholden, when he"
3548,"MY LORD,","honoured any effort of mine with his approbation. But, my Lord, as"
3549,"MY LORD,",there was discrimination in the opinion he gave; as he did not veil
3550,"MY LORD,",indifference for insipid mediocrity of composition under any general
3551,"MY LORD,",expression of cool approval: I allow myself to draw a favourable
3552,"MY LORD,",conclusion from the verdict of one who had the superiority of
3553,"MY LORD,","intellect few would dispute, which he made manifest by a force of"
3554,"MY LORD,",eloquence peculiar to himself; whose excellent judgment no one of his
3555,"MY LORD,","friends found cause to distrust, and whose acknowledged candour no"
3556,"MY LORD,",enemy had the temerity to deny.
3557,"MY LORD,",
3558,"MY LORD,","With such encouragement, I present my book to your Lordship: the"
3559,"MY LORD,",Account of the _Life and Writings of Lopez de Vega_ has taught me what
3560,"MY LORD,","I am to expect; I there perceive how your Lordship can write, and am"
3561,"MY LORD,","there taught how you can judge of writers: my faults, however"
3562,"MY LORD,","numerous, I know will none of them escape through inattention, nor"
3563,"MY LORD,",will any merit be lost for want of discernment; my verses are before
3564,"MY LORD,","him who has written elegantly, who has judged with accuracy, and who"
3565,"MY LORD,",has given unequivocal proof of abilities in a work of difficulty--a
3566,"MY LORD,","translation of poetry, which few persons in this kingdom are able to"

3586,PREFACE.,
3587,PREFACE.,"About twenty-five years since was published a poem called ""The"
3588,PREFACE.,"Library,"" which, in no long time, was followed by two others, ""The"
3589,PREFACE.,"Village,"" and ""The Newspaper."" These, with a few alterations and"
3590,PREFACE.,"additions, are here reprinted; and are accompanied by a poem of"
3591,PREFACE.,"greater length, and several shorter attempts, now, for the first time,"
3592,PREFACE.,before the public; whose reception of them creates in their author
3593,PREFACE.,"something more than common solicitude, because he conceives that, with"
3594,PREFACE.,"the judgment to be formed of these latter productions, upon whatever"
3595,PREFACE.,"may be found intrinsically meritorious or defective, there will be"
3596,PREFACE.,united an inquiry into the relative degree of praise or blame which
3597,PREFACE.,"they may be thought to deserve, when compared with the more early"
3598,PREFACE.,attempts of the same writer.
3599,PREFACE.,
3600,PREFACE.,"And certainly, were it the principal employment of a man's life to"
3601,PREFACE.,"compose verses, it might seem reasonable to expect that he would"
3602,PREFACE.,"continue to improve as long as he continued to live; though, even"
3603,PREFACE.,"then, there is some doubt whether such improvement would follow, and"
3604,PREFACE.,"perhaps proof might be adduced to show it would not. But when, to this"
3605,PREFACE.,"""_idle trade_"" is added some ""_calling_,"" with superior claims upon"
3606,PREFACE.,"his time and attention, his progress in the art of versification will"
3607,PREFACE.,"probably be in proportion neither to the years he has lived, nor even"
3608,PREFACE.,to the attempts he has made.
3609,PREFACE.,
3610,PREFACE.,"While composing the first-published of these poems, the author was"
3611,PREFACE.,honoured with the notice and assisted by the advice of the Right
3612,PREFACE.,"Honourable Edmund Burke; part of it was written in his presence, and"
3613,PREFACE.,"the whole submitted to his judgment; receiving, in its progress, the"
3614,PREFACE.,"benefit of his correction. I hope, therefore, to obtain pardon of the"
3615,PREFACE.,"reader, if I eagerly seize the occasion, and, after so long a"
3616,PREFACE.,"silence, endeavour to express a grateful sense of the benefits I have"
3617,PREFACE.,"received from this gentleman, who was solicitous for my more essential"
3618,PREFACE.,"interests, as well as benevolently anxious for my credit as a writer."
3619,PREFACE.,
3620,PREFACE.,I will not enter upon the subject of his extraordinary abilities; it
3621,PREFACE.,"would be vanity, it would be weakness, in me to believe that I could"
3622,PREFACE.,make them better known or more admired than they now are. But of his
3623,PREFACE.,"private worth, of his wishes to do good, of his affability and"
3624,PREFACE.,condescension; his readiness to lend assistance when he knew it was
3625,PREFACE.,"wanted, and his delight to give praise where he thought it was"
3626,PREFACE.,deserved: of these I may write with some propriety. All know that his
3627,PREFACE.,"powers were vast, his acquirements various; and I take leave to add,"
3628,PREFACE.,that he applied them with unremitted attention to those objects which
3629,PREFACE.,he believed tended to the honour and welfare of his country. But it
3630,PREFACE.,may not be so generally understood that he was ever assiduous in the
3631,PREFACE.,more private duties of a benevolent nature; that he delighted to give
3632,PREFACE.,"encouragement to any promise of ability, and assistance to any"
3633,PREFACE.,"appearance of desert. To what purposes he employed his pen, and with"
3634,PREFACE.,"what eloquence he spake in the senate, will be told by many, who yet"
3635,PREFACE.,"may be ignorant of the solid instruction, as well as the fascinating"
3636,PREFACE.,"pleasantry, found in his common conversation, amongst his friends, and"
3637,PREFACE.,"his affectionate manners, amiable disposition, and zeal for their"
3638,PREFACE.,"happiness, which he manifested in the hours of retirement with his"
3639,PREFACE.,family.
3640,PREFACE.,
3641,PREFACE.,To this gentleman I was indebted for my knowledge of Sir Joshua
3642,PREFACE.,"Reynolds, who was as well known to his friends for his perpetual fund"
3643,PREFACE.,"of good-humour and his unceasing wishes to oblige, as he was to the"
3644,PREFACE.,public for the extraordinary productions of his pencil and his pen. By
3645,PREFACE.,"him I was favoured with an introduction to Doctor Johnson, who"
3646,PREFACE.,"honoured me with his notice, and assisted me, as Mr. Boswell has told,"
3647,PREFACE.,with remarks and emendations for a poem I was about to publish. The
3648,PREFACE.,"doctor had been often wearied by applications, and did not readily"
3649,PREFACE.,comply with requests for his opinion: not from any unwillingness to
3650,PREFACE.,"oblige, but from a painful contention in his mind between a desire of"
3651,PREFACE.,"giving pleasure and a determination to speak truth. No man can, I"
3652,PREFACE.,"think, publish a work without some expectation of satisfying those"
3653,PREFACE.,"who are to judge of its merit; but I can, with the utmost regard to"
3654,PREFACE.,"veracity, speak my fears, as predominating over every pre-indulged"
3655,PREFACE.,"thought of a more favourable nature, when I was told that a judge so"
3656,PREFACE.,"discerning had consented to read and give his opinion of ""The"
3657,PREFACE.,"Village,"" the poem I had prepared for publication. The time of"
3658,PREFACE.,suspense was not long protracted; I was soon favoured with a few words
3659,PREFACE.,"from Sir Joshua, who observed, ""If I knew how cautious Doctor Johnson"
3660,PREFACE.,"was in giving commendation, I should be well satisfied with the"
3661,PREFACE.,"portion dealt to me in his letter."" Of that letter the following is a"

3669,"""SIR,",not often better [than] his own: but he may take mine and his own

3741,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""","gain such assistance; the opinion of a critic so qualified, and a"
3742,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""",friend so disposed to favour me. I had been honoured by an
3743,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""",introduction to the Right Honourable Charles James Fox some years
3744,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""","before, at the seat of Mr. Burke; and, being again with him, I"
3745,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""",received a promise that he would peruse any work I might send to him

3748,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""","afterwards, I had collected some poems for his inspection, I found my"
3749,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""","right honourable friend engaged by the affairs of a great empire, and"
3750,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""","struggling with the inveteracy of a fatal disease; at such time, upon"
3751,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""","such mind, ever disposed to oblige as that mind was, I could not"
3752,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""",obtrude the petty business of criticising verses; but he remembered
3753,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""","the promise he had kindly given, and repeated an offer, which, though"
3754,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""","I had not presumed to expect, I was happy to receive. A copy of the"

3757,"""SAM. JOHNSON.""","to inform my readers) the poem which I have named ""The Parish"

4512,THE LIBRARY.,A thousand visions float around my head.
4513,THE LIBRARY.,"Hark! hollow blasts through empty courts resound,"
4514,THE LIBRARY.,And shadowy forms with staring eyes stalk round;
4515,THE LIBRARY.,"See! moats and bridges, walls and castles rise,"
4516,THE LIBRARY.,"Ghosts, fairies, demons, dance before our eyes;                    550"
4517,THE LIBRARY.,"Lo! magic verse inscribed on golden gate,"
4518,THE LIBRARY.,And bloody hand that beckons on to fate:--
4519,THE LIBRARY.,"""And who art thou, thou little page, unfold!"
4520,THE LIBRARY.,"Say, doth thy lord my Claribel withhold?"
4521,THE LIBRARY.,"Go tell him straight, Sir Knight, thou must resign"
4522,THE LIBRARY.,"The captive queen--for Claribel is mine."""
4523,THE LIBRARY.,"Away he flies; and now for bloody deeds,"
4524,THE LIBRARY.,"Black suits of armour, masks, and foaming steeds;"
4525,THE LIBRARY.,"The giant falls, his recreant throat I seize,"
4526,THE LIBRARY.,And from his corslet take the massy keys;                          560
4527,THE LIBRARY.,"Dukes, lords, and knights in long procession move,"
4528,THE LIBRARY.,Released from bondage with my virgin love;
4529,THE LIBRARY.,"She comes! she comes! in all the charms of youth,"
4530,THE LIBRARY.,Unequall'd love and unsuspected truth!
4531,THE LIBRARY.,"Ah! happy he who thus, in magic themes,"
4532,THE LIBRARY.,"O'er worlds bewitch'd in early rapture dreams,"
4533,THE LIBRARY.,"Where wild Enchantment waves her potent wand,"
4534,THE LIBRARY.,And Fancy's beauties fill her fairy land;
4535,THE LIBRARY.,"Where doubtful objects strange desires excite,"
4536,THE LIBRARY.,And Fear and Ignorance afford delight.                             570
4537,THE LIBRARY.,"But lost, for ever lost, to me these joys,"
4538,THE LIBRARY.,"Which Reason scatters, and which Time destroys--"
4539,THE LIBRARY.,Too dearly bought: maturer judgment calls
4540,THE LIBRARY.,My busied mind from tales and madrigals;
4541,THE LIBRARY.,"My doughty giants all are slain or fled,"
4542,THE LIBRARY.,"And all my knights, blue, green, and yellow, dead!"
4543,THE LIBRARY.,"No more the midnight fairy tribe I view,"
4544,THE LIBRARY.,All in the merry moonshine tippling dew;

4546,THE LIBRARY.,"The church-yard ghost, is now at rest again;                       580"
4547,THE LIBRARY.,And all these wayward wanderings of my youth
4548,THE LIBRARY.,Fly Reason's power and shun the light of truth.
4549,THE LIBRARY.,"With fiction, then, does real joy reside,"
4550,THE LIBRARY.,And is our reason the delusive guide?
4551,THE LIBRARY.,"Is it, then, right to dream the syrens sing,"
4552,THE LIBRARY.,Or mount enraptured on the dragon's wing?
4553,THE LIBRARY.,"No, 'tis the infant mind, to care unknown,"
4554,THE LIBRARY.,That makes th' imagined paradise its own;
4555,THE LIBRARY.,"Soon as reflections in the bosom rise,"

4557,THE LIBRARY.,"The tear and smile, that once together rose,"
4558,THE LIBRARY.,Are then divorced; the head and heart are foes:
4559,THE LIBRARY.,"Enchantment bows to Wisdom's serious plan,"
4560,THE LIBRARY.,And Pain and Prudence make and mar the man.
4561,THE LIBRARY.,
4562,THE LIBRARY.,"While thus, of power and fancied empire vain,"
4563,THE LIBRARY.,With various thoughts my mind I entertain;
4564,THE LIBRARY.,"While books, my slaves, with tyrant hand I seize,"
4565,THE LIBRARY.,Pleased with the pride that will not let them please;
4566,THE LIBRARY.,"Sudden I find terrific thoughts arise,"
4567,THE LIBRARY.,And sympathetic sorrow fills my eyes;                              600
4568,THE LIBRARY.,"For, lo! while yet my heart admits the wound,"
4569,THE LIBRARY.,I see the CRITIC army ranged around.
4570,THE LIBRARY.,Foes to our race! if ever ye have known

4573,THE LIBRARY.,"Ye thought the sudden sentiment divine,"
4574,THE LIBRARY.,"Then paused and doubted, and then, tired of doubt,"

4577,THE LIBRARY.,"Ye ventured on the world your labour'd song,                       610"
4578,THE LIBRARY.,And from the crusty critics of those days
4579,THE LIBRARY.,Implored the feeble tribute of their praise:
4580,THE LIBRARY.,"Remember now the fears that moved you then,"
4581,THE LIBRARY.,"And, spite of truth, let mercy guide your pen!"
4582,THE LIBRARY.,What vent'rous race are ours! what mighty foes
4583,THE LIBRARY.,Lie waiting all around them to oppose!
4584,THE LIBRARY.,What treacherous friends betray them to the fight!
4585,THE LIBRARY.,What dangers threaten them--yet still they write:
4586,THE LIBRARY.,"A hapless tribe! to every evil born,"
4587,THE LIBRARY.,"Whom villains hate, and fools affect to scorn;                     620"

4594,THE LIBRARY.,From dusty piles and ancient volumes broke;
4595,THE LIBRARY.,"Gathering above, like mists condensed they seem,"
4596,THE LIBRARY.,Exhaled in summer from the rushy stream;
4597,THE LIBRARY.,"Like flowing robes they now appear, and twine"
4598,THE LIBRARY.,Round the large members of a form divine;                          630
4599,THE LIBRARY.,"His silver beard, that swept his aged breast,                        }"

4602,THE LIBRARY.,"Fear chill'd my heart: to one of mortal race,"
4603,THE LIBRARY.,How awful seem'd the Genius of the place!
4604,THE LIBRARY.,"So, in Cimmerian shores, Ulysses saw"
4605,THE LIBRARY.,"His parent-shade, and shrunk in pious awe;"
4606,THE LIBRARY.,"Like him I stood, and wrapt in thought profound,"
4607,THE LIBRARY.,When from the pitying power broke forth a solemn sound:--
4608,THE LIBRARY.,"""Care lives with all; no rules, no precepts save               640 }"
4609,THE LIBRARY.,"The wise from wo, no fortitude the brave;                            }"

4611,THE LIBRARY.,"Tempests and storms in life's whole progress rise,"
4612,THE LIBRARY.,And hope shines dimly through o'erclouded skies;
4613,THE LIBRARY.,"Some drops of comfort on the favour'd fall,"
4614,THE LIBRARY.,But showers of sorrow are the lot of _all_:
4615,THE LIBRARY.,"Partial to talents, then, shall Heav'n withdraw"
4616,THE LIBRARY.,"Th' afflicting rod, or break the general law?"
4617,THE LIBRARY.,"Shall he who soars, inspired by loftier views,"
4618,THE LIBRARY.,Life's little cares and little pains refuse?                       650

4627,THE LIBRARY.,"To him perhaps the milder lot's assign'd,"

5355,TO THE READER.,"The Poem which I now offer to the Public, is, I believe, the only one"
5356,TO THE READER.,"written on the subject; at least, it is the only one which I have any"
5357,TO THE READER.,"knowledge of; and, fearing there may not be found in it many things to"
5358,TO THE READER.,"engage the Reader's attention, I am willing to take the strongest hold"
5359,TO THE READER.,"I can upon him, by offering something which has the claim of novelty."
5360,TO THE READER.,
5361,TO THE READER.,"When the subject first occurred to me, I meant, in a few lines only,"
5362,TO THE READER.,to give some description of that variety of dissociating articles
5363,TO THE READER.,which are huddled together in our Daily Papers. As the thought dwelt
5364,TO THE READER.,"upon me, I conceived this might be done methodically, and with some"
5365,TO THE READER.,"connection of parts, by taking a larger scope; which notwithstanding I"
5366,TO THE READER.,"have done, I must still apologize for a want of union and coherence in"
5367,TO THE READER.,my Poem. Subjects like this will not easily admit of them: we cannot
5368,TO THE READER.,"slide from theme to theme in an easy and graceful succession; but, on"
5369,TO THE READER.,"quitting one thought, there will be an unavoidable hiatus, and in"
5370,TO THE READER.,general an awkward transition into that which follows.
5371,TO THE READER.,
5372,TO THE READER.,"That, in writing upon the subject of our Newspapers, I have avoided"
5373,TO THE READER.,"every thing which might appear like the opinion of a party, is to be"
5374,TO THE READER.,"accounted for from the knowledge I have gained from them; since, the"
5375,TO THE READER.,"more of these Instructors a man reads, the less he will infallibly"
5376,TO THE READER.,"understand; nor would it have been very consistent in me, at the same"

5379,TO THE READER.,
5380,TO THE READER.,I should have been glad to have made some discrimination in my remarks
5381,TO THE READER.,"on these productions. There is, indeed, some difference; and I have"
5382,TO THE READER.,"observed, that one editor will sometimes convey his abuse with more"
5383,TO THE READER.,"decency, and colour his falsehood with more appearance of probability,"
5384,TO THE READER.,"than another: but till I see that paper, wherein no great character is"
5385,TO THE READER.,"wantonly abused, nor groundless insinuation wilfully disseminated, I"
5386,TO THE READER.,shall not make any distinction in my remarks upon them.
5387,TO THE READER.,
5388,TO THE READER.,"It must, however, be confessed, that these things have their use, and"

6150,_BAPTISMS._,Where all are talkers and where none can teach;
6151,_BAPTISMS._,"Where still the welcome and the words are old,"
6152,_BAPTISMS._,And the same stories are for ever told--
6153,_BAPTISMS._,"Yet theirs is joy that, bursting from the heart,                   160"

6162,_BAPTISMS._,To this infected row we term our street.
6163,_BAPTISMS._,"Here, in cabal, a disputatious crew                              170"
6164,_BAPTISMS._,"Each evening meet: the sot, the cheat, the shrew;"
6165,_BAPTISMS._,"Riots are nightly heard--the curse, the cries"
6166,_BAPTISMS._,"Of beaten wife, perverse in her replies;"
6167,_BAPTISMS._,"While shrieking children hold each threat'ning hand,"
6168,_BAPTISMS._,"And sometimes life, and sometimes food, demand:"
6169,_BAPTISMS._,"Boys, in their first-stol'n rags, to swear begin,"
6170,_BAPTISMS._,"And girls, who heed not dress, are skill'd in gin:"
6171,_BAPTISMS._,Snarers and smugglers here their gains divide;
6172,_BAPTISMS._,Ensnaring females here their victims hide;
6173,_BAPTISMS._,"And here is one, the sibyl of the row,                             180"
6174,_BAPTISMS._,"Who knows all secrets, or affects to know."
6175,_BAPTISMS._,"Seeking their fate, to her the simple run,"
6176,_BAPTISMS._,"To her the guilty, theirs awhile to shun;"
6177,_BAPTISMS._,"Mistress of worthless arts, depraved in will,"
6178,_BAPTISMS._,"Her care unbless'd and unrepaid her skill,"
6179,_BAPTISMS._,"Slave to the tribe, to whose command she stoops,"
6180,_BAPTISMS._,And poorer than the poorest maid she dupes.
6181,_BAPTISMS._,"Between the road-way and the walls, offence"
6182,_BAPTISMS._,Invades all eyes and strikes on every sense:
6183,_BAPTISMS._,"There lie, obscene, at every open door,                            190"
6184,_BAPTISMS._,Heaps from the hearth and sweepings from the floor;
6185,_BAPTISMS._,"And day by day the mingled masses grow,"
6186,_BAPTISMS._,As sinks are disembogued and kennels flow.
6187,_BAPTISMS._,There hungry dogs from hungry children steal;
6188,_BAPTISMS._,There pigs and chickens quarrel for a meal;
6189,_BAPTISMS._,"There dropsied infants wail without redress,"
6190,_BAPTISMS._,And all is want and wo and wretchedness:
6191,_BAPTISMS._,"Yet, should these boys, with bodies bronzed and bare,"
6192,_BAPTISMS._,"High-swoln and hard, outlive that lack of care,"
6193,_BAPTISMS._,"Forced on some farm, the unexerted strength,                       200"
6194,_BAPTISMS._,"Though loth to action, is compell'd at length,"
6195,_BAPTISMS._,"When warm'd by health, as serpents in the spring"
6196,_BAPTISMS._,Aside their slough of indolence they fling.
6197,_BAPTISMS._,"Yet, ere they go, a greater evil comes--"
6198,_BAPTISMS._,See! crowded beds in those contiguous rooms;
6199,_BAPTISMS._,Beds but ill parted by a paltry screen
6200,_BAPTISMS._,Of paper'd lath or curtain dropp'd between;
6201,_BAPTISMS._,"Daughters and sons to yon compartments creep,"
6202,_BAPTISMS._,And parents here beside their children sleep.
6203,_BAPTISMS._,"Ye who have power, these thoughtless people part,                  210"
6204,_BAPTISMS._,Nor let the ear be first to taint the heart!
6205,_BAPTISMS._,"Come! search within, nor sight nor smell regard;"
6206,_BAPTISMS._,The true physician walks the foulest ward.
6207,_BAPTISMS._,See! on the floor what frouzy patches rest!
6208,_BAPTISMS._,What nauseous fragments on yon fractured chest!
6209,_BAPTISMS._,What downy dust beneath yon window-seat!
6210,_BAPTISMS._,And round these posts that serve this bed for feet;
6211,_BAPTISMS._,"This bed, where all those tatter'd garments lie,"
6212,_BAPTISMS._,"Worn by each sex, and now perforce thrown by!"
6213,_BAPTISMS._,"See! as we gaze, an infant lifts its head,                       220"
6214,_BAPTISMS._,Left by neglect and burrow'd in that bed;
6215,_BAPTISMS._,The mother-gossip has the love suppress'd
6216,_BAPTISMS._,An infant's cry once waken'd in her breast;
6217,_BAPTISMS._,"And daily prattles, as her round she takes,"
6218,_BAPTISMS._,(With strong resentment) of the want she makes.
6219,_BAPTISMS._,"Whence all these woes?--From want of virtuous will,"
6220,_BAPTISMS._,"Of honest shame, of time-improving skill;"
6221,_BAPTISMS._,"From want of care t'employ the vacant hour,"
6222,_BAPTISMS._,And want of ev'ry kind but want of power.
6223,_BAPTISMS._,"Here are no wheels for either wool or flax,                      230"
6224,_BAPTISMS._,But packs of cards--made up of sundry packs;
6225,_BAPTISMS._,"Here is no clock, nor will they turn the glass."
6226,_BAPTISMS._,And see how swift th'important moments pass;
6227,_BAPTISMS._,"Here are no books, but ballads on the wall"
6228,_BAPTISMS._,"Are some abusive, and indecent all;"
6229,_BAPTISMS._,"Pistols are here, unpair'd; with nets and hooks,"
6230,_BAPTISMS._,"Of every kind, for rivers, ponds, and brooks;"
6231,_BAPTISMS._,"An ample flask, that nightly rovers fill"
6232,_BAPTISMS._,With recent poison from the Dutchman's still;
6233,_BAPTISMS._,"A box of tools, with wires of various size,                      240 }"
6234,_BAPTISMS._,"Frocks, wigs, and hats, for night or day disguise,                   }"
6235,_BAPTISMS._,And bludgeons stout to gain or guard a prize.                        }
6236,_BAPTISMS._,"To every house belongs a space of ground,"
6237,_BAPTISMS._,"Of equal size, once fenced with paling round;"
6238,_BAPTISMS._,"That paling now by slothful waste destroy'd,"
6239,_BAPTISMS._,"Dead gorse and stumps of elder fill the void,"
6240,_BAPTISMS._,"Save in the centre-spot, whose walls of clay"
6241,_BAPTISMS._,Hide sots and striplings at their drink or play.
6242,_BAPTISMS._,"Within, a board, beneath a tiled retreat,"
6243,_BAPTISMS._,Allures the bubble and maintains the cheat;                        250
6244,_BAPTISMS._,Where heavy ale in spots like varnish shows;
6245,_BAPTISMS._,Where chalky tallies yet remain in rows;
6246,_BAPTISMS._,"Black pipes and broken jugs the seats defile,"
6247,_BAPTISMS._,"The walls and windows, rhymes and reck'nings vile;"
6248,_BAPTISMS._,"Prints of the meanest kind disgrace the door,"
6249,_BAPTISMS._,"And cards, in curses torn, lie fragments on the floor."
6250,_BAPTISMS._,"Here his poor bird th'inhuman cocker brings,"
6251,_BAPTISMS._,Arms his hard heel and clips his golden wings;
6252,_BAPTISMS._,"With spicy food th'impatient spirit feeds,"
6253,_BAPTISMS._,And shouts and curses as the battle bleeds.                        260
6254,_BAPTISMS._,"Struck through the brain, deprived of both his eyes,"
6255,_BAPTISMS._,The vanquish'd bird must combat till he dies;
6256,_BAPTISMS._,"Must faintly peck at his victorious foe,"
6257,_BAPTISMS._,And reel and stagger at each feeble blow.
6258,_BAPTISMS._,"When fall'n, the savage grasps his dabbled plumes,"
6259,_BAPTISMS._,"His blood-stain'd arms, for other deaths assumes;"
6260,_BAPTISMS._,"And damns the craven-fowl, that lost his stake,"
6261,_BAPTISMS._,And only bled and perish'd for his sake.
6262,_BAPTISMS._,"Such are our peasants, those to whom we yield"
6263,_BAPTISMS._,"Praise with relief, the fathers of the field;                      270"
6264,_BAPTISMS._,"And these who take, from our reluctant hands,"
6265,_BAPTISMS._,What Burn advises or the Bench commands.
6266,_BAPTISMS._,"Our farmers round, well pleased with constant gain,"
6267,_BAPTISMS._,"Like other farmers, flourish and complain.--"
6268,_BAPTISMS._,"These are our groups; our portraits next appear,"
6269,_BAPTISMS._,And close our exhibition for the year.

6272,_BAPTISMS._,
6273,_BAPTISMS._,With evil omen we that year begin:
6274,_BAPTISMS._,"A Child of Shame--stern Justice adds, of Sin--"
6275,_BAPTISMS._,"Is first recorded; I would hide the deed,"
6276,_BAPTISMS._,But vain the wish; I sigh and I proceed:                           280
6277,_BAPTISMS._,"And could I well th' instructive truth convey,"
6278,_BAPTISMS._,'Twould warn the giddy and awake the gay.
6279,_BAPTISMS._,"Of all the nymphs who gave our village grace,"
6280,_BAPTISMS._,The Miller's daughter had the fairest face.
6281,_BAPTISMS._,Proud was the Miller; money was his pride;
6282,_BAPTISMS._,"He rode to market, as our farmers ride;"
6283,_BAPTISMS._,"And 'twas his boast, inspired by spirits, there,"
6284,_BAPTISMS._,His favourite Lucy should be rich as fair;
6285,_BAPTISMS._,"But she must meek and still obedient prove,"
6286,_BAPTISMS._,"And not presume, without his leave, to love.                       290"
6287,_BAPTISMS._,"A youthful Sailor heard him;--""Ha!"" quoth he,"
6288,_BAPTISMS._,"""This Miller's maiden is a prize for me;"
6289,_BAPTISMS._,"Her charms I love, his riches I desire,"
6290,_BAPTISMS._,And all his threats but fan the kindling fire;
6291,_BAPTISMS._,"My ebbing purse no more the foe shall fill,"
6292,_BAPTISMS._,"But Love's kind act and Lucy at the mill."""
6293,_BAPTISMS._,"Thus thought the youth, and soon the chase began,"
6294,_BAPTISMS._,"Stretch'd all his sail, nor thought of pause or plan:"
6295,_BAPTISMS._,"His trusty staff in his bold hand he took,"
6296,_BAPTISMS._,"Like him and like his frigate, heart of oak;                       300"
6297,_BAPTISMS._,"Fresh were his features, his attire was new;"
6298,_BAPTISMS._,"Clean was his linen, and his jacket blue:"
6299,_BAPTISMS._,"Of finest jean, his trowsers, tight and trim,"
6300,_BAPTISMS._,Brush'd the large buckle at the silver rim.
6301,_BAPTISMS._,"He soon arrived, he traced the village-green;"
6302,_BAPTISMS._,"There saw the maid, and was with pleasure seen;"
6303,_BAPTISMS._,"Then talk'd of love, till Lucy's yielding heart"
6304,_BAPTISMS._,"Confess'd 'twas painful, though 'twas right, to part."
6305,_BAPTISMS._,"""For ah! my father has a haughty soul;"
6306,_BAPTISMS._,"Whom best he loves, he loves but to control;                       310"
6307,_BAPTISMS._,"Me to some churl in bargain he'll consign,"
6308,_BAPTISMS._,And make some tyrant of the parish mine:
6309,_BAPTISMS._,"Cold is his heart, and he with looks severe"
6310,_BAPTISMS._,Has often forced but never shed the tear;
6311,_BAPTISMS._,"Save, when my mother died, some drops express'd"
6312,_BAPTISMS._,A kind of sorrow for a wife at rest.--
6313,_BAPTISMS._,"To me a master's stern regard is shown,"
6314,_BAPTISMS._,"I'm like his steed, prized highly as his own;"
6315,_BAPTISMS._,"Stroked but corrected, threaten'd when supplied,"
6316,_BAPTISMS._,"His slave and boast, his victim and his pride.""                    320"
6317,_BAPTISMS._,"""Cheer up, my lass! I'll to thy father go--"
6318,_BAPTISMS._,The Miller cannot be the Sailor's foe;
6319,_BAPTISMS._,"Both live by Heaven's free gale, that plays aloud"
6320,_BAPTISMS._,In the stretch'd canvas and the piping shroud;
6321,_BAPTISMS._,"The rush of winds, the flapping sails above,"
6322,_BAPTISMS._,"And rattling planks within, are sounds _we_ love;"
6323,_BAPTISMS._,"Calms are our dread; when tempests plough the deep,"
6324,_BAPTISMS._,"We take a reef, and to the rocking sleep."""
6325,_BAPTISMS._,"""Ha!"" quoth the Miller, moved at speech so rash,"
6326,_BAPTISMS._,"""Art thou like me? then, where thy notes and cash?                 330"
6327,_BAPTISMS._,"Away to Wapping, and a wife command,"
6328,_BAPTISMS._,"With all thy wealth, a guinea, in thine hand;"
6329,_BAPTISMS._,"There with thy messmates quaff the muddy cheer,"
6330,_BAPTISMS._,"And leave my Lucy for thy betters here."""
6331,_BAPTISMS._,"""Revenge! revenge!"" the angry lover cried,"
6332,_BAPTISMS._,"Then sought the nymph, and ""Be thou now my bride."""
6333,_BAPTISMS._,"Bride had she been, but they no priest could move"
6334,_BAPTISMS._,To bind in law the couple bound by love.
6335,_BAPTISMS._,"What sought these lovers then by day, by night,"
6336,_BAPTISMS._,But stolen moments of disturb'd delight--                          340
6337,_BAPTISMS._,"Soft trembling tumults, terrors dearly prized,"
6338,_BAPTISMS._,"Transports that pain'd, and joys that agonized:"
6339,_BAPTISMS._,"Till the fond damsel, pleased with lad so trim,"
6340,_BAPTISMS._,"Awed by her parent, and enticed by him,"
6341,_BAPTISMS._,"Her lovely form from savage power to save,"
6342,_BAPTISMS._,"Gave--not her hand, but ALL she could, she gave."
6343,_BAPTISMS._,"Then came the day of shame, the grievous night,"
6344,_BAPTISMS._,"The varying look, the wandering appetite;"
6345,_BAPTISMS._,"The joy assumed, while sorrow dimm'd the eyes;"
6346,_BAPTISMS._,The forced sad smiles that follow'd sudden sighs;                  350
6347,_BAPTISMS._,"And every art, long used, but used in vain,"
6348,_BAPTISMS._,"To hide thy progress, Nature, and thy pain."
6349,_BAPTISMS._,"Too eager caution shows some danger's near,"
6350,_BAPTISMS._,The bully's bluster proves the coward's fear;
6351,_BAPTISMS._,"His sober step the drunkard vainly tries,"
6352,_BAPTISMS._,And nymphs expose the failings they disguise.
6353,_BAPTISMS._,"First, whispering gossips were in parties seen;"
6354,_BAPTISMS._,Then louder Scandal walk'd the village-green;
6355,_BAPTISMS._,"Next babbling Folly told the growing ill,"
6356,_BAPTISMS._,And busy Malice dropp'd it at the mill.                            360
6357,_BAPTISMS._,"""Go! to thy curse and mine,"" the Father said,"
6358,_BAPTISMS._,"""Strife and confusion stalk around thy bed;"
6359,_BAPTISMS._,"Want and a wailing brat thy portion be,"
6360,_BAPTISMS._,"Plague to thy fondness, as thy fault to me.--"
6361,_BAPTISMS._,"Where skulks the villain?""--""On the ocean wide"
6362,_BAPTISMS._,"My William seeks a portion for his bride.""--"
6363,_BAPTISMS._,"""Vain be his search! but, till the traitor come,"
6364,_BAPTISMS._,The higgler's cottage be thy future home;
6365,_BAPTISMS._,"There with his ancient shrew and care abide,"
6366,_BAPTISMS._,"And hide thy head--thy shame thou canst not hide.""                 370"
6367,_BAPTISMS._,Day after day was pass'd in pains and grief;
6368,_BAPTISMS._,Week follow'd week--and still was no relief.
6369,_BAPTISMS._,Her boy was born--no lads nor lasses came
6370,_BAPTISMS._,To grace the rite or give the child a name;
6371,_BAPTISMS._,"Nor grave conceited nurse, of office proud,"
6372,_BAPTISMS._,Bore the young Christian roaring through the crowd:
6373,_BAPTISMS._,"In a small chamber was my office done,"
6374,_BAPTISMS._,Where blinks through paper'd panes the setting sun;
6375,_BAPTISMS._,"Where noisy sparrows, perch'd on penthouse near,"
6376,_BAPTISMS._,"Chirp tuneless joy, and mock the frequent tear;                    380"
6377,_BAPTISMS._,"Bats on their webby wings in darkness move,"
6378,_BAPTISMS._,And feebly shriek their melancholy love.
6379,_BAPTISMS._,No Sailor came; the months in terror fled!
6380,_BAPTISMS._,"Then news arrived: he fought, and he was DEAD!"
6381,_BAPTISMS._,"At the lone cottage Lucy lives, and still"
6382,_BAPTISMS._,Walks for her weekly pittance to the mill;
6383,_BAPTISMS._,"A mean seraglio there her father keeps,"
6384,_BAPTISMS._,"Whose mirth insults her, as she stands and weeps,"
6385,_BAPTISMS._,"And sees the plenty, while compell'd to stay,"
6386,_BAPTISMS._,Her father's pride become his harlot's prey.                       390
6387,_BAPTISMS._,"Throughout the lanes she glides, at evening's close,"
6388,_BAPTISMS._,And softly lulls her infant to repose;
6389,_BAPTISMS._,"Then sits and gazes, but with viewless look,"
6390,_BAPTISMS._,As gilds the moon the rippling of the brook;
6391,_BAPTISMS._,"And sings her vespers, but in voice so low,"
6392,_BAPTISMS._,She hears their murmurs as the waters flow:
6393,_BAPTISMS._,"And she too murmurs, and begins to find"
6394,_BAPTISMS._,The solemn wanderings of a wounded mind.
6395,_BAPTISMS._,"Visions of terror, views of wo succeed,"
6396,_BAPTISMS._,"The mind's impatience, to the body's need;                         400"
6397,_BAPTISMS._,"By turns to that, by turns to this, a prey,"
6398,_BAPTISMS._,"She knows what reason yields, and dreads what madness may."
6399,_BAPTISMS._,
6400,_BAPTISMS._,"Next, with their boy, a decent couple came,"
6401,_BAPTISMS._,"And call'd him Robert, 'twas his father's name;"
6402,_BAPTISMS._,"Three girls preceded, all by time endear'd,"
6403,_BAPTISMS._,And future births were neither hoped nor fear'd.
6404,_BAPTISMS._,"Bless'd in each other, but to no excess,"
6405,_BAPTISMS._,"Health, quiet, comfort, form'd their happiness;"
6406,_BAPTISMS._,"Love, all made up of torture and delight,"
6407,_BAPTISMS._,Was but mere madness in this couple's sight:                       410
6408,_BAPTISMS._,"Susan could think, though not without a sigh,"
6409,_BAPTISMS._,"If she were gone, who should her place supply;"
6410,_BAPTISMS._,"And Robert, half in earnest, half in jest,"
6411,_BAPTISMS._,Talk of her spouse when he should be at rest:
6412,_BAPTISMS._,"Yet strange would either think it to be told,"
6413,_BAPTISMS._,Their love was cooling or their hearts were cold.
6414,_BAPTISMS._,"Few were their acres,--but, with these content,"
6415,_BAPTISMS._,"They were, each pay-day, ready with their rent;"
6416,_BAPTISMS._,"And few their wishes--what their farm denied,"
6417,_BAPTISMS._,"The neighbouring town, at trifling cost, supplied.                 420"
6418,_BAPTISMS._,If at the draper's window Susan cast
6419,_BAPTISMS._,"A longing look, as with her goods she pass'd,"
6420,_BAPTISMS._,"And, with the produce of the wheel and churn,"
6421,_BAPTISMS._,Bought her a Sunday-robe on her return;
6422,_BAPTISMS._,"True to her maxim, she would take no rest,"
6423,_BAPTISMS._,Till care repaid that portion to the chest:
6424,_BAPTISMS._,"Or if, when loitering at the Whitsun-fair,"
6425,_BAPTISMS._,Her Robert spent some idle shillings there;
6426,_BAPTISMS._,"Up at the barn, before the break of day,"
6427,_BAPTISMS._,He made his labour for th'indulgence pay:                          430
6428,_BAPTISMS._,Thus both--that waste itself might work in vain--
6429,_BAPTISMS._,"Wrought double tides, and all was well again."
6430,_BAPTISMS._,"Yet, though so prudent, there were times of joy,"
6431,_BAPTISMS._,"(The day they wed, the christening of the boy,)"
6432,_BAPTISMS._,When to the wealthier farmers there was shown
6433,_BAPTISMS._,"Welcome unfeign'd, and plenty like their own;"
6434,_BAPTISMS._,"For Susan served the great, and had some pride"
6435,_BAPTISMS._,Among our topmost people to preside.
6436,_BAPTISMS._,"Yet in that plenty, in that welcome free,"
6437,_BAPTISMS._,"There was the guiding nice frugality,                              440"
6438,_BAPTISMS._,"That, in the festal as the frugal day,"
6439,_BAPTISMS._,"Has, in a different mode, a sovereign sway;"
6440,_BAPTISMS._,"As tides the same attractive influence know,"
6441,_BAPTISMS._,In the least ebb and in their proudest flow:
6442,_BAPTISMS._,"The wise frugality, that does not give"
6443,_BAPTISMS._,"A life to saving, but that saves to live;"
6444,_BAPTISMS._,"Sparing, not pinching, mindful though not mean,"
6445,_BAPTISMS._,"O'er all presiding, yet in nothing seen."
6446,_BAPTISMS._,
6447,_BAPTISMS._,"Recorded next, a babe of love I trace,"
6448,_BAPTISMS._,Of many loves the mother's fresh disgrace.--                       450
6449,_BAPTISMS._,"""Again, thou harlot! could not all thy pain,"
6450,_BAPTISMS._,"All my reproof, thy wanton thoughts restrain?"""
6451,_BAPTISMS._,"""Alas! your reverence, wanton thoughts, I grant,"
6452,_BAPTISMS._,"Were once my motive, now the thoughts of want;"
6453,_BAPTISMS._,"Women, like me, as ducks in a decoy,"
6454,_BAPTISMS._,"Swim down a stream, and seem to swim in joy;"
6455,_BAPTISMS._,"Your sex pursue us, and our own disdain;"
6456,_BAPTISMS._,"Return is dreadful, and escape is vain."
6457,_BAPTISMS._,"Would men forsake us, and would women strive"
6458,_BAPTISMS._,"To help the fall'n, their virtue might revive.""                    460"
6459,_BAPTISMS._,"For rite of churching soon she made her way,"
6460,_BAPTISMS._,"In dread of scandal, should she miss the day.--"
6461,_BAPTISMS._,"Two matrons came! with them she humbly knelt,"
6462,_BAPTISMS._,"Their action copied and their comforts felt,"
6463,_BAPTISMS._,"From that great pain and peril to be free,"
6464,_BAPTISMS._,Though still in peril of that pain to be;
6465,_BAPTISMS._,"Alas! what numbers, like this amorous dame,"
6466,_BAPTISMS._,"Are quick to censure, but are dead to shame!"

6505,_BAPTISMS._,"Sad troubles, Gerard! now pertain to thee,"
6506,_BAPTISMS._,When thy rich master seems from trouble free;
6507,_BAPTISMS._,"But 'tis one fate at different times assign'd,"

6719,_BAPTISMS._,"Sad, silent, supple, bending to the blow,"
6720,_BAPTISMS._,"A slave of slaves, the lowest of the low;"
6721,_BAPTISMS._,His pliant soul gave way to all things base;

6725,_BAPTISMS._,"Him might the meanest pauper bruise and cheat,"
6726,_BAPTISMS._,He was a footstool for the beggar's feet;
6727,_BAPTISMS._,His were the legs that ran at all commands;
6728,_BAPTISMS._,They used on all occasions Richard's hands.
6729,_BAPTISMS._,His very soul was not his own; he stole
6730,_BAPTISMS._,"As others order'd, and without a dole;"
6731,_BAPTISMS._,"In all disputes, on either part he lied,"
6732,_BAPTISMS._,And freely pledged his oath on either side;
6733,_BAPTISMS._,"In all rebellions Richard join'd the rest,"
6734,_BAPTISMS._,In all detections Richard first confess'd.                         730
6735,_BAPTISMS._,"Yet, though disgraced, he watch'd his time so well,"
6736,_BAPTISMS._,"He rose in favour, when in fame he fell;"
6737,_BAPTISMS._,"Base was his usage, vile his whole employ,"
6738,_BAPTISMS._,And all despised and fed the pliant boy.
6739,_BAPTISMS._,"At length, ""'tis time he should abroad be sent,"""
6740,_BAPTISMS._,Was whisper'd near him--and abroad he went.
6741,_BAPTISMS._,"One morn they call'd him, Richard answered not;"
6742,_BAPTISMS._,"They deem'd him hanging, and in time forgot;"
6743,_BAPTISMS._,"Yet miss'd him long, as each, throughout the clan,"
6744,_BAPTISMS._,"Found he ""had better spared a better man.""                         740"
6745,_BAPTISMS._,"Now Richard's talents for the world were fit,"
6746,_BAPTISMS._,"He'd no small cunning, and had some small wit;"
6747,_BAPTISMS._,"Had that calm look which seem'd to all assent,"
6748,_BAPTISMS._,And that complacent speech which nothing meant;
6749,_BAPTISMS._,"He'd but one care, and that he strove to hide,"
6750,_BAPTISMS._,How best for Richard Monday to provide.
6751,_BAPTISMS._,"Steel, through opposing plates, the magnet draws,"
6752,_BAPTISMS._,And steely atoms culls from dust and straws;
6753,_BAPTISMS._,"And thus our hero, to his interest true,"
6754,_BAPTISMS._,Gold through all bars and from each trifle drew;                   750
6755,_BAPTISMS._,"But, still more surely round the world to go,"
6756,_BAPTISMS._,This fortune's child had neither friend nor foe.
6757,_BAPTISMS._,"Long lost to us, at last our man we trace--"
6758,_BAPTISMS._,Sir Richard Monday died at Monday-place.
6759,_BAPTISMS._,"His lady's worth, his daughter's, we peruse,"
6760,_BAPTISMS._,And find his grandsons all as rich as Jews;
6761,_BAPTISMS._,"He gave reforming charities a sum,"
6762,_BAPTISMS._,And bought the blessings of the blind and dumb;
6763,_BAPTISMS._,"Bequeathed to missions money from the stocks,"
6764,_BAPTISMS._,And Bibles issued from his private box;                            760
6765,_BAPTISMS._,"But, to his native place severely just,"
6766,_BAPTISMS._,He left a pittance bound in rigid trust--
6767,_BAPTISMS._,"Two paltry pounds, on every quarter's-day,"
6768,_BAPTISMS._,(At church produced) for forty loaves should pay:
6769,_BAPTISMS._,"A stinted gift, that to the parish shows"
6770,_BAPTISMS._,He kept in mind their bounty and their blows!
6771,_BAPTISMS._,"To farmers three, the year has given a son:"
6772,_BAPTISMS._,"Finch on the Moor, and French, and Middleton."
6773,_BAPTISMS._,Twice in this year a female Giles I see:
6774,_BAPTISMS._,"A Spalding once, and once a Barnaby--                              770"
6775,_BAPTISMS._,"A humble man is he, and, when they meet,"
6776,_BAPTISMS._,Our farmers find him on a distant seat;
6777,_BAPTISMS._,There for their wit he serves a constant theme--
6778,_BAPTISMS._,"They praise his dairy, they extol his team,"
6779,_BAPTISMS._,They ask the price of each unrivall'd steed.
6780,_BAPTISMS._,"And whence his sheep, that admirable breed?"
6781,_BAPTISMS._,"His thriving arts they beg he would explain,"
6782,_BAPTISMS._,And where he puts the money he must gain.
6783,_BAPTISMS._,"They have their daughters, but they fear their friend"
6784,_BAPTISMS._,Would think his sons too much would condescend;                    780
6785,_BAPTISMS._,"They have their sons who would their fortunes try,"
6786,_BAPTISMS._,But fear his daughters will their suit deny.
6787,_BAPTISMS._,"So runs the joke, while James, with sigh profound,"
6788,_BAPTISMS._,"And face of care, looks moveless on the ground;"
6789,_BAPTISMS._,"His cares, his sighs, provoke the insult more,"
6790,_BAPTISMS._,And point the jest--for Barnaby is poor.
6791,_BAPTISMS._,
6792,_BAPTISMS._,"Last in my list, five untaught lads appear;"
6793,_BAPTISMS._,"Their father dead, compassion sent them here--"
6794,_BAPTISMS._,For still that rustic infidel denied
6795,_BAPTISMS._,To have their names with solemn rite applied.                      790
6796,_BAPTISMS._,"His, a lone house, by Deadman's Dyke-way stood;"
6797,_BAPTISMS._,"And his, a nightly haunt, in Lonely-wood."
6798,_BAPTISMS._,"Each village inn has heard the ruffian boast,"
6799,_BAPTISMS._,That he believed in neither God nor ghost;
6800,_BAPTISMS._,"That, when the sod upon the sinner press'd,"
6801,_BAPTISMS._,"He, like the saint, had everlasting rest;"
6802,_BAPTISMS._,"That never priest believed his doctrines true,"
6803,_BAPTISMS._,"But would, for profit, own himself a Jew,"
6804,_BAPTISMS._,"Or worship wood and stone, as honest heathen do;"
6805,_BAPTISMS._,"That fools alone on future worlds rely,                            800"
6806,_BAPTISMS._,"And all who die for faith, deserve to die."
6807,_BAPTISMS._,"These maxims, part th' attorney's clerk profess'd;"
6808,_BAPTISMS._,His own transcendent genius found the rest.
6809,_BAPTISMS._,"Our pious matrons heard, and, much amazed,"
6810,_BAPTISMS._,"Gazed on the man, and trembled as they gazed;"
6811,_BAPTISMS._,"And now his face explored, and now his feet,"
6812,_BAPTISMS._,"Man's dreaded foe, in this bad man, to meet."
6813,_BAPTISMS._,"But him our drunkards as their champion raised,"
6814,_BAPTISMS._,"Their bishop call'd, and as their hero praised;"
6815,_BAPTISMS._,"Though most, when sober, and the rest, when sick,                  810"
6816,_BAPTISMS._,Had little question whence his bishopric.
6817,_BAPTISMS._,"But he, triumphant spirit! all things dared,"
6818,_BAPTISMS._,"He poach'd the wood, and on the warren snared;"
6819,_BAPTISMS._,"'Twas his, at cards, each novice to trepan,"
6820,_BAPTISMS._,And call the wants of rogues the rights of man;
6821,_BAPTISMS._,"Wild as the winds, he let his offspring rove,"
6822,_BAPTISMS._,And deem'd the marriage-bond the bane of love.
6823,_BAPTISMS._,"What age and sickness, for a man so bold,"
6824,_BAPTISMS._,"Had done, we know not--none beheld him old."
6825,_BAPTISMS._,"By night, as business urged, he sought the wood--                  820"
6826,_BAPTISMS._,The ditch was deep--the rain had caused a flood--
6827,_BAPTISMS._,"The foot-bridge fail'd--he plunged beneath the deep,"
6828,_BAPTISMS._,"And slept, if truth were his, th' eternal sleep."
6829,_BAPTISMS._,
6830,_BAPTISMS._,"These have we named; on life's rough sea they sail,"
6831,_BAPTISMS._,"With many a prosperous, many an adverse gale!"
6832,_BAPTISMS._,"Where passion soon, like powerful winds, will rage,"
6833,_BAPTISMS._,"And prudence, wearied, with their strength engage."
6834,_BAPTISMS._,"Then each, in aid, shall some companion ask,"
6835,_BAPTISMS._,For help or comfort in the tedious task;
6836,_BAPTISMS._,"And what that help--what joys from union flow,                     830"
6837,_BAPTISMS._,"What good or ill, we next prepare to show;"
6838,_BAPTISMS._,"And row, meantime, our weary bark ashore,"
6839,_BAPTISMS._,As Spenser his--but not with Spenser's oar[21].

6961,_MARRIAGES._,"Whom we beheld, aspiringly content:"

6965,_MARRIAGES._,"With smiles and gracious looks, her fortune tried;                  90"

6972,_MARRIAGES._,"But not her warmth, nor all her winning ways,"

6974,_MARRIAGES._,"Of beauty heedless, with the merry mute,"
6975,_MARRIAGES._,To Mistress Dobson he preferr'd his suit;                          100
6976,_MARRIAGES._,"There proved his service, there address'd his vows,"
6977,_MARRIAGES._,And saw her mistress--friend--protectress--spouse;
6978,_MARRIAGES._,"A butler now, he thanks his powerful bride,"
6979,_MARRIAGES._,"And, like her keys, keeps constant at her side."
6980,_MARRIAGES._,
6981,_MARRIAGES._,"Next at our altar stood a luckless pair,"
6982,_MARRIAGES._,Brought by strong passions and a warrant there;
6983,_MARRIAGES._,"By long rent cloak, hung loosely, strove the bride,"
6984,_MARRIAGES._,From ev'ry eye what all perceived to hide;
6985,_MARRIAGES._,"While the boy-bridegroom, shuffling in his pace,"
6986,_MARRIAGES._,Now hid awhile and then exposed his face;                          110
6987,_MARRIAGES._,As shame alternately with anger strove
6988,_MARRIAGES._,The brain confused with muddy ale to move.
6989,_MARRIAGES._,"In haste and stammering he perform'd his part,"
6990,_MARRIAGES._,And look'd the rage that rankled in his heart;
6991,_MARRIAGES._,"(So will each lover inly curse his fate,"
6992,_MARRIAGES._,Too soon made happy and made wise too late;)
6993,_MARRIAGES._,"I saw his features take a savage gloom,"
6994,_MARRIAGES._,And deeply threaten for the days to come.
6995,_MARRIAGES._,"Low spake the lass, and lisp'd and minced the while,"
6996,_MARRIAGES._,"Look'd on the lad, and faintly tried to smile;                     120"
6997,_MARRIAGES._,With soften'd speech and humbled tone she strove
6998,_MARRIAGES._,To stir the embers of departed love:
6999,_MARRIAGES._,"While he, a tyrant, frowning walk'd before,"
7000,_MARRIAGES._,"Felt the poor purse and sought the public door,"
7001,_MARRIAGES._,"She, sadly following, in submission went,"
7002,_MARRIAGES._,And saw the final shilling foully spent;
7003,_MARRIAGES._,"Then to her father's hut the pair withdrew,"
7004,_MARRIAGES._,And bade to love and comfort long adieu!
7005,_MARRIAGES._,"Ah! fly temptation, youth, refrain! refrain!"
7006,_MARRIAGES._,I preach for ever; but I preach in vain!                           130
7007,_MARRIAGES._,
7008,_MARRIAGES._,"Two summers since, I saw, at Lammas Fair,"
7009,_MARRIAGES._,"The sweetest flower that ever blossom'd there,"
7010,_MARRIAGES._,"When Phoebe Dawson gaily cross'd the Green,"
7011,_MARRIAGES._,In haste to see and happy to be seen:
7012,_MARRIAGES._,"Her air, her manners, all who saw admired,"
7013,_MARRIAGES._,"Courteous though coy, and gentle though retired;"
7014,_MARRIAGES._,"The joy of youth and health her eyes display'd,"
7015,_MARRIAGES._,And ease of heart her every look convey'd;
7016,_MARRIAGES._,"A native skill her simple robes express'd,"
7017,_MARRIAGES._,As with untutor'd elegance she dress'd;                            140
7018,_MARRIAGES._,"The lads around admired so fair a sight,"
7019,_MARRIAGES._,"And Phoebe felt, and felt she gave, delight."
7020,_MARRIAGES._,"Admirers soon of every age she gain'd,"
7021,_MARRIAGES._,Her beauty won them and her worth retain'd;
7022,_MARRIAGES._,"Envy itself could no contempt display,"
7023,_MARRIAGES._,"They wish'd her well, whom yet they wish'd away."
7024,_MARRIAGES._,"Correct in thought, she judged a servant's place"
7025,_MARRIAGES._,Preserved a rustic beauty from disgrace;
7026,_MARRIAGES._,"But yet on Sunday-eve, in freedom's hour,"
7027,_MARRIAGES._,"With secret joy she felt that beauty's power,                      150"
7028,_MARRIAGES._,"When some proud bliss upon the heart would steal,"
7029,_MARRIAGES._,"That, poor or rich, a beauty still must feel.--"
7030,_MARRIAGES._,"At length, the youth, ordain'd to move her breast,"
7031,_MARRIAGES._,Before the swains with bolder spirit press'd;
7032,_MARRIAGES._,"With looks less timid made his passion known,"
7033,_MARRIAGES._,And pleased by manners most unlike her own;
7034,_MARRIAGES._,"Loud though in love, and confident though young;"
7035,_MARRIAGES._,"Fierce in his air, and voluble of tongue;"
7036,_MARRIAGES._,"By trade a tailor, though, in scorn of trade,"
7037,_MARRIAGES._,"He served the 'Squire, and brush'd the coat he made:               160"
7038,_MARRIAGES._,"Yet now, would Phoebe her consent afford,"
7039,_MARRIAGES._,"Her slave alone, again he'd mount the board;"
7040,_MARRIAGES._,"With her should years of growing love be spent,"
7041,_MARRIAGES._,And growing wealth--she sigh'd and look'd consent.
7042,_MARRIAGES._,"Now, through the lane, up hill, and 'cross the green,"
7043,_MARRIAGES._,"(Seen by but few, and blushing to be seen--"
7044,_MARRIAGES._,"Dejected, thoughtful, anxious, and afraid,)"
7045,_MARRIAGES._,"Led by the lover, walk'd the silent maid."
7046,_MARRIAGES._,"Slow through the meadows roved they many a mile,"
7047,_MARRIAGES._,Toy'd by each bank and trifled at each stile;                      170
7048,_MARRIAGES._,"Where, as he painted every blissful view,"
7049,_MARRIAGES._,"And highly colour'd what he strongly drew,"
7050,_MARRIAGES._,"The pensive damsel, prone to tender fears,"
7051,_MARRIAGES._,Dimm'd the false prospect with prophetic tears.--
7052,_MARRIAGES._,"Thus pass'd th' allotted hours, till, lingering late,"
7053,_MARRIAGES._,The lover loiter'd at the master's gate;
7054,_MARRIAGES._,"There he pronounced adieu! and yet would stay,"
7055,_MARRIAGES._,"Till chidden--soothed--entreated--forced away,"
7056,_MARRIAGES._,"He would of coldness, though indulged, complain,"
7057,_MARRIAGES._,And oft retire and oft return again;                               180
7058,_MARRIAGES._,"When, if his teasing vex'd her gentle mind,"
7059,_MARRIAGES._,"The grief assumed, compell'd her to be kind!"
7060,_MARRIAGES._,"For he would proof of plighted kindness crave,"
7061,_MARRIAGES._,"That she resented first and then forgave,"
7062,_MARRIAGES._,And to his grief and penance yielded more
7063,_MARRIAGES._,Than his presumption had required before.--
7064,_MARRIAGES._,"Ah! fly temptation, youth; refrain! refrain,"
7065,_MARRIAGES._,Each yielding maid and each presuming swain!
7066,_MARRIAGES._,
7067,_MARRIAGES._,"Lo! now with red rent cloak and bonnet black,"
7068,_MARRIAGES._,"And torn green gown loose hanging at her back,                     190"
7069,_MARRIAGES._,"One who an infant in her arms sustains,"
7070,_MARRIAGES._,And seems in patience striving with her pains;
7071,_MARRIAGES._,"Pinch'd are her looks, as one who pines for bread,"
7072,_MARRIAGES._,Whose cares are growing and whose hopes are fled;
7073,_MARRIAGES._,"Pale her parch'd lips, her heavy eyes sunk low,"
7074,_MARRIAGES._,And tears unnoticed from their channels flow;
7075,_MARRIAGES._,"Serene her manner, till some sudden pain"
7076,_MARRIAGES._,"Frets the meek soul, and then she's calm again.--"
7077,_MARRIAGES._,"Her broken pitcher to the pool she takes,"
7078,_MARRIAGES._,And every step with cautious terror makes;                         200
7079,_MARRIAGES._,"For not alone that infant in her arms,"
7080,_MARRIAGES._,"But nearer cause, her anxious soul alarms."
7081,_MARRIAGES._,"With water burthen'd, then she picks her way,"
7082,_MARRIAGES._,"Slowly and cautious, in the clinging clay;"
7083,_MARRIAGES._,"Till, in mid-green, she trusts a place unsound,"
7084,_MARRIAGES._,And deeply plunges in th' adhesive ground;
7085,_MARRIAGES._,"Thence, but with pain, her slender foot she takes,"
7086,_MARRIAGES._,"While hope the mind, as strength the frame, forsakes:"
7087,_MARRIAGES._,"For, when so full the cup of sorrow grows,"
7088,_MARRIAGES._,"Add but a drop, it instantly o'erflows.                            210"
7089,_MARRIAGES._,"And now her path, but not her peace, she gains,"
7090,_MARRIAGES._,"Safe from her task, but shivering with her pains;"
7091,_MARRIAGES._,"Her home she reaches, open leaves the door,"
7092,_MARRIAGES._,"And, placing first her infant on the floor,"
7093,_MARRIAGES._,"She bares her bosom to the wind, and sits,"
7094,_MARRIAGES._,And sobbing struggles with the rising fits.
7095,_MARRIAGES._,"In vain, they come; she feels th'inflating grief,"
7096,_MARRIAGES._,That shuts the swelling bosom from relief;
7097,_MARRIAGES._,"That speaks in feeble cries a soul distressed,"
7098,_MARRIAGES._,Or the sad laugh that cannot be repress'd.                         220
7099,_MARRIAGES._,The neighbour-matron leaves her wheel and flies
7100,_MARRIAGES._,With all the aid her poverty supplies;
7101,_MARRIAGES._,"Unfee'd, the calls of Nature she obeys,"
7102,_MARRIAGES._,"Not led by profit, nor allured by praise;"
7103,_MARRIAGES._,"And, waiting long, till these contentions cease,"
7104,_MARRIAGES._,"She speaks of comfort, and departs in peace."
7105,_MARRIAGES._,"Friend of distress! the mourner feels thy aid,"
7106,_MARRIAGES._,"She cannot pay thee, but thou wilt be paid."
7107,_MARRIAGES._,
7108,_MARRIAGES._,"But who this child of weakness, want, and care?"
7109,_MARRIAGES._,"'Tis Phoebe Dawson, pride of Lammas Fair;                          230"
7110,_MARRIAGES._,"Who took her lover for his sparkling eyes,"
7111,_MARRIAGES._,"Expressions warm, and love-inspiring lies."
7112,_MARRIAGES._,"Compassion first assail'd her gentle heart,"
7113,_MARRIAGES._,"For all his suffering, all his bosom's smart:"
7114,_MARRIAGES._,"And then his prayers! they would a savage move,"
7115,_MARRIAGES._,And win the coldest of the sex to love.
7116,_MARRIAGES._,"But ah! too soon his looks success declared,"
7117,_MARRIAGES._,Too late her loss the marriage-rite repaired;
7118,_MARRIAGES._,"The faithless flatterer then his vows forgot,"
7119,_MARRIAGES._,A captious tyrant or a noisy sot:                                  240
7120,_MARRIAGES._,"If present, railing, till he saw her pain'd;"
7121,_MARRIAGES._,"If absent, spending what their labours gain'd;"
7122,_MARRIAGES._,"Till that fair form in want and sickness pined,"
7123,_MARRIAGES._,And hope and comfort fled that gentle mind.
7124,_MARRIAGES._,"Then fly temptation, youth; resist, refrain!"
7125,_MARRIAGES._,Nor let me preach for ever and in vain!
7126,_MARRIAGES._,
7127,_MARRIAGES._,"Next came a well-dress'd pair, who left their coach,"
7128,_MARRIAGES._,"And made, in long procession, slow approach;"
7129,_MARRIAGES._,"For this gay bride had many a female friend,"
7130,_MARRIAGES._,"And youths were there, this favoured youth t' attend.              250"
7131,_MARRIAGES._,"Silent, nor wanting due respect, the crowd"
7132,_MARRIAGES._,"Stood humbly round, and gratulation bow'd;"
7133,_MARRIAGES._,"But not that silent crowd, in wonder fix'd,"
7134,_MARRIAGES._,"Not numerous friends, who praise and envy mix'd,"
7135,_MARRIAGES._,Nor nymphs attending near to swell the pride
7136,_MARRIAGES._,"Of one more fair, the ever-smiling bride;"
7137,_MARRIAGES._,"Nor that gay bride, adorn'd with every grace,                        }"
7138,_MARRIAGES._,"Nor love nor joy triumphant in her face,                             }"
7139,_MARRIAGES._,Could from the youth's sad signs of sorrow chase.                    }
7140,_MARRIAGES._,"Why didst thou grieve? wealth, pleasure, freedom thine;            260"
7141,_MARRIAGES._,"Vex'd it thy soul, that freedom to resign?"
7142,_MARRIAGES._,"Spake Scandal truth? ""Thou didst not then intend"
7143,_MARRIAGES._,"So soon to bring thy wooing to an end""?"
7144,_MARRIAGES._,"Or, was it, as our prating rustics say,"
7145,_MARRIAGES._,"To end as soon, but in a different way?"
7146,_MARRIAGES._,"'Tis told, thy Phillis is a skilful dame,"
7147,_MARRIAGES._,Who play'd uninjured with the dangerous flame:
7148,_MARRIAGES._,"That, while, like Lovelace, thou thy coat display'd,"
7149,_MARRIAGES._,"And hid the snare for her affection laid,"
7150,_MARRIAGES._,"Thee, with her net, she found the means to catch,                  270"
7151,_MARRIAGES._,"And, at the amorous see-saw, won the match[22]."
7152,_MARRIAGES._,"Yet others tell, the Captain fix'd thy doubt,"
7153,_MARRIAGES._,"He'd call thee brother, or he'd call thee out.--"
7154,_MARRIAGES._,"But rest the motive--all retreat too late,"
7155,_MARRIAGES._,Joy like thy bride's should on thy brow have sate;
7156,_MARRIAGES._,"The deed had then appear'd thine own intent,                         }"
7157,_MARRIAGES._,"A glorious day, by gracious fortune sent,                            }"
7158,_MARRIAGES._,In each revolving year to be in triumph spent.                       }
7159,_MARRIAGES._,Then in few weeks that cloudy brow had been
7160,_MARRIAGES._,Without a wonder or a whisper seen;                                280
7161,_MARRIAGES._,"And none had been so weak as to inquire,"
7162,_MARRIAGES._,"""Why pouts my Lady?"" or ""why frowns the Squire?"""
7163,_MARRIAGES._,
7164,_MARRIAGES._,"How fair these names, how much unlike they look"
7165,_MARRIAGES._,To all the blurr'd subscriptions in my book:
7166,_MARRIAGES._,The bridegroom's letters stand in row above.
7167,_MARRIAGES._,"Tapering yet stout, like pine-trees in his grove;"
7168,_MARRIAGES._,"While free and fine the bride's appear below,"
7169,_MARRIAGES._,As light and slender as her jasmines grow.
7170,_MARRIAGES._,"Mark now in what confusion, stoop or stand,"
7171,_MARRIAGES._,The crooked scrawls of many a clownish hand;                       290
7172,_MARRIAGES._,"Now out, now in, they droop, they fall, they rise,"
7173,_MARRIAGES._,Like raw recruits drawn forth for exercise;
7174,_MARRIAGES._,"Ere yet reform'd and modell'd by the drill,"
7175,_MARRIAGES._,The free-born legs stand striding as they will.
7176,_MARRIAGES._,"Much have I tried to guide the fist along,"
7177,_MARRIAGES._,But still the blunderers placed their blottings wrong:
7178,_MARRIAGES._,"Behold these marks uncouth! how strange that men,"
7179,_MARRIAGES._,"Who guide the plough, should fail to guide the pen."
7180,_MARRIAGES._,For half a mile the furrows even lie;
7181,_MARRIAGES._,For half an inch the letters stand awry;--                         300
7182,_MARRIAGES._,"Our peasants, strong and sturdy in the field,"
7183,_MARRIAGES._,Cannot these arms of idle students wield;
7184,_MARRIAGES._,"Like them, in feudal days, their valiant lords"
7185,_MARRIAGES._,Resign'd the pen and grasp'd their conqu'ring swords;
7186,_MARRIAGES._,They to robed clerks and poor dependent men
7187,_MARRIAGES._,Left the light duties of the peaceful pen;
7188,_MARRIAGES._,"Nor to their ladies wrote, but sought to prove,"
7189,_MARRIAGES._,"By deeds of death, their hearts were fill'd with love."
7190,_MARRIAGES._,"But yet, small arts have charms for female eyes;"
7191,_MARRIAGES._,Our rustic nymphs the beau and scholar prize;                      310
7192,_MARRIAGES._,"Unletter'd swains and ploughmen coarse they slight,"
7193,_MARRIAGES._,"For those who dress, and amorous scrolls indite."
7194,_MARRIAGES._,
7195,_MARRIAGES._,"For Lucy Collins happier days had been,"
7196,_MARRIAGES._,Had Footman Daniel scorn'd his native green;
7197,_MARRIAGES._,"Or when he came an idle coxcomb down,"
7198,_MARRIAGES._,Had he his love reserved for lass in town;
7199,_MARRIAGES._,"To Stephen Hill she then had pledged her truth,--"
7200,_MARRIAGES._,"A sturdy, sober, kind, unpolish'd youth;"
7201,_MARRIAGES._,"But from the day, that fatal day she spied"
7202,_MARRIAGES._,"The pride of Daniel, Daniel was her pride.                         320"
7203,_MARRIAGES._,In all concerns was Stephen just and true;                           }
7204,_MARRIAGES._,"But coarse his doublet was and patch'd in view,                      }"
7205,_MARRIAGES._,"And felt his stockings were, and blacker than his shoe;              }"
7206,_MARRIAGES._,While Daniel's linen all was fine and fair--
7207,_MARRIAGES._,"His master wore it, and he deign'd to wear;"
7208,_MARRIAGES._,"(To wear his livery, some respect might prove;"
7209,_MARRIAGES._,"To wear his linen, must be sign of love:)"
7210,_MARRIAGES._,"Blue was his coat, unsoil'd by spot or stain;"
7211,_MARRIAGES._,"His hose were silk, his shoes of Spanish-grain;"
7212,_MARRIAGES._,A silver knot his breadth of shoulder bore;                      330 }
7213,_MARRIAGES._,A diamond buckle blazed his breast before--                          }
7214,_MARRIAGES._,Diamond he swore it was! and show'd it as he swore;                  }
7215,_MARRIAGES._,Rings on his fingers shone; his milk-white hand
7216,_MARRIAGES._,Could pick-tooth case and box for snuff command:
7217,_MARRIAGES._,"And thus, with clouded cane, a fop complete,"
7218,_MARRIAGES._,"He stalk'd, the jest and glory of the street."
7219,_MARRIAGES._,"Join'd with these powers, he could so sweetly sing,"
7220,_MARRIAGES._,"Talk with such toss, and saunter with such swing;"
7221,_MARRIAGES._,"Laugh with such glee, and trifle with such art,"
7222,_MARRIAGES._,That Lucy's promise fail'd to shield her heart.                    340
7223,_MARRIAGES._,"Stephen, meantime, to ease his amorous cares,"
7224,_MARRIAGES._,Fix'd his full mind upon his farm's affairs;
7225,_MARRIAGES._,"Two pigs, a cow, and wethers half a score,"
7226,_MARRIAGES._,"Increased his stock, and still he look'd for more."
7227,_MARRIAGES._,"He, for his acres few, so duly paid,"
7228,_MARRIAGES._,That yet more acres to his lot were laid;
7229,_MARRIAGES._,"Till our chaste nymphs no longer felt disdain,"
7230,_MARRIAGES._,And prudent matrons praised the frugal swain;
7231,_MARRIAGES._,"Who, thriving well, through many a fruitful year,"
7232,_MARRIAGES._,"Now clothed himself anew, and acted overseer.                      350"
7233,_MARRIAGES._,"Just then poor Lucy, from her friend in town,"
7234,_MARRIAGES._,"Fled in pure fear, and came a beggar down;"
7235,_MARRIAGES._,"Trembling, at Stephen's door she knock'd for bread--                 }"
7236,_MARRIAGES._,"Was chidden first, next pitied, and then fed;                        }"
7237,_MARRIAGES._,"Then sat at Stephen's board, then shared in Stephen's bed            }"
7238,_MARRIAGES._,"All hope of marriage lost in her disgrace,"
7239,_MARRIAGES._,"He mourns a flame revived, and she a love of lace."
7240,_MARRIAGES._,
7241,_MARRIAGES._,Now to be wed a well-match'd couple came;
7242,_MARRIAGES._,"Twice had old Lodge been tied, and twice the dame;"
7243,_MARRIAGES._,"Tottering they came and toying, (odious scene!)                    360"
7244,_MARRIAGES._,"And fond and simple, as they'd always been."
7245,_MARRIAGES._,Children from wedlock we by laws restrain;
7246,_MARRIAGES._,"Why not prevent them, when they're such again?"
7247,_MARRIAGES._,"Why not forbid the doting souls, to prove"
7248,_MARRIAGES._,Th' indecent fondling of preposterous love?
7249,_MARRIAGES._,"In spite of prudence, uncontroll'd by shame,"
7250,_MARRIAGES._,"The amorous senior woos the toothless dame,"
7251,_MARRIAGES._,"Relating idly, at the closing eve,"
7252,_MARRIAGES._,The youthful follies he disdains to leave;
7253,_MARRIAGES._,"Till youthful follies wake a transient fire,                       370"
7254,_MARRIAGES._,When arm in arm they totter and retire.
7255,_MARRIAGES._,"So a fond pair of solemn birds, all day,"
7256,_MARRIAGES._,Blink in their seat and doze the hours away;
7257,_MARRIAGES._,"Then, by the moon awaken'd, forth they move,"
7258,_MARRIAGES._,And fright the songsters with their cheerless love.
7259,_MARRIAGES._,"So two sear trees, dry, stunted, and unsound,"
7260,_MARRIAGES._,"Each other catch, when dropping to the ground;"
7261,_MARRIAGES._,"Entwine their wither'd arms 'gainst wind and weather,"
7262,_MARRIAGES._,"And shake their leafless heads, and drop together."
7263,_MARRIAGES._,"So two cold limbs, touch'd by Galvani's wire,                    380"
7264,_MARRIAGES._,"Move with new life, and feel awaken'd fire;"
7265,_MARRIAGES._,"Quivering awhile, their flaccid forms remain,"
7266,_MARRIAGES._,Then turn to cold torpidity again.
7267,_MARRIAGES._,
7268,_MARRIAGES._,"""But ever frowns your Hymen? man and maid,"
7269,_MARRIAGES._,"Are all repenting, suffering, or betray'd?"""
7270,_MARRIAGES._,"Forbid it, Love! we have our couples here"
7271,_MARRIAGES._,Who hail the day in each revolving year:
7272,_MARRIAGES._,"These are with us, as in the world around;"
7273,_MARRIAGES._,"They are not frequent, but they may be found."
7274,_MARRIAGES._,"Our farmers, too; what, though they fail to prove,               390"
7275,_MARRIAGES._,"In Hymen's bonds, the tenderest slaves of love,"
7276,_MARRIAGES._,"(Nor, like those pairs whom sentiment unites,"
7277,_MARRIAGES._,Feel they the fervour of the mind's delights:)
7278,_MARRIAGES._,"Yet, coarsely kind and comfortably gay,"
7279,_MARRIAGES._,They heap the board and hail the happy day:
7280,_MARRIAGES._,"And, though the bride, now freed from school, admits"
7281,_MARRIAGES._,Of pride implanted there some transient fits;
7282,_MARRIAGES._,"Yet soon she casts her girlish flights aside,"
7283,_MARRIAGES._,And in substantial blessings rests her pride.
7284,_MARRIAGES._,"No more she moves in measured steps, no more                       400"
7285,_MARRIAGES._,"Runs, with bewilder'd ear, her music o'er;"
7286,_MARRIAGES._,"No more recites her French the hinds among,"
7287,_MARRIAGES._,But chides her maidens in her mother-tongue;
7288,_MARRIAGES._,"Her tambour-frame she leaves and diet spare,"
7289,_MARRIAGES._,Plain work and plenty with her house to share;
7290,_MARRIAGES._,"Till, all her varnish lost, in few short years,"
7291,_MARRIAGES._,"In all her worth, the farmer's wife appears."
7292,_MARRIAGES._,Yet not the ancient kind; nor she who gave
7293,_MARRIAGES._,Her soul to gain--a mistress and a slave:
7294,_MARRIAGES._,Who not to sleep allow'd the needful time;                         410
7295,_MARRIAGES._,"To whom repose was loss, and sport a crime;"
7296,_MARRIAGES._,"Who, in her meanest room (and all were mean),"
7297,_MARRIAGES._,"A noisy drudge, from morn till night was seen;--"
7298,_MARRIAGES._,"But she, the daughter, boasts a decent room,"
7299,_MARRIAGES._,"Adorn'd with carpet, form'd in Wilton's loom;"
7300,_MARRIAGES._,Fair prints along the paper'd wall are spread                        }
7301,_MARRIAGES._,"There, Werter sees the sportive children fed,                        }"
7302,_MARRIAGES._,"And Charlotte, here, bewails her lover dead.                         }"
7303,_MARRIAGES._,"'Tis here, assembled, while in space apart"
7304,_MARRIAGES._,"Their husbands, drinking, warm the opening heart,                  420"
7305,_MARRIAGES._,"Our neighbouring dames, on festal days, unite"
7306,_MARRIAGES._,With tongues more fluent and with hearts as light;
7307,_MARRIAGES._,"Theirs is that art, which English wives alone"
7308,_MARRIAGES._,Profess--a boast and privilege their own;
7309,_MARRIAGES._,"An art it is, where each at once attends"
7310,_MARRIAGES._,"To all, and claims attention from her friends,"
7311,_MARRIAGES._,"When they engage the tongue, the eye, the ear,"
7312,_MARRIAGES._,"Reply when list'ning, and when speaking hear:"
7313,_MARRIAGES._,"The ready converse knows no dull delays,"
7314,_MARRIAGES._,"""But double are the pains, and double be the praise[23].""          430"
7315,_MARRIAGES._,
7316,_MARRIAGES._,Yet not to those alone who bear command
7317,_MARRIAGES._,Heaven gives a heart to hail the marriage band;
7318,_MARRIAGES._,"Among their servants, we the pairs can show,"
7319,_MARRIAGES._,Who much to love and more to prudence owe.
7320,_MARRIAGES._,"Reuben and Rachel, though as fond as doves,"
7321,_MARRIAGES._,Were yet discreet and cautious in their loves;
7322,_MARRIAGES._,"Nor would attend to Cupid's wild commands,"
7323,_MARRIAGES._,Till cool reflection bade them join their hands.
7324,_MARRIAGES._,"When both were poor, they thought it argued ill"
7325,_MARRIAGES._,Of hasty love to make them poorer still;                           440
7326,_MARRIAGES._,"Year after year, with savings long laid by,"
7327,_MARRIAGES._,They bought the future dwelling's full supply;
7328,_MARRIAGES._,"Her frugal fancy cull'd the smaller ware,"
7329,_MARRIAGES._,The weightier purchase ask'd her Reuben's care;
7330,_MARRIAGES._,"Together then their last year's gain they threw,"
7331,_MARRIAGES._,"And lo! an auction'd bed, with curtains neat and new."
7332,_MARRIAGES._,"Thus both, as prudence counsell'd, wisely stay'd,"
7333,_MARRIAGES._,And cheerful then the calls of Love obey'd:
7334,_MARRIAGES._,"What if, when Rachel gave her hand, 'twas one"
7335,_MARRIAGES._,Embrown'd by Winter's ice and Summer's sun?                        450
7336,_MARRIAGES._,"What if, in Reuben's hair, the female eye"
7337,_MARRIAGES._,Usurping grey among the black could spy?
7338,_MARRIAGES._,"What if, in both, life's bloomy flush was lost,"
7339,_MARRIAGES._,And their full autumn felt the mellowing frost?
7340,_MARRIAGES._,"Yet time, who blow'd the rose of youth away,"
7341,_MARRIAGES._,Had left the vigorous stem without decay;
7342,_MARRIAGES._,"Like those tall elms, in Farmer Frankford's ground,"
7343,_MARRIAGES._,They'll grow no more--but all their growth is sound;
7344,_MARRIAGES._,"By time confirm'd and rooted in the land,"
7345,_MARRIAGES._,"The storms they've stood, still promise they shall stand.          460"
7346,_MARRIAGES._,
7347,_MARRIAGES._,"These are the happier pairs: their life has rest,"
7348,_MARRIAGES._,"Their hopes are strong, their humble portion bless'd;"
7349,_MARRIAGES._,"While those, more rash, to hasty marriage led,"
7350,_MARRIAGES._,Lament th' impatience which now stints their bread.
7351,_MARRIAGES._,"When such their union, years their cares increase;"
7352,_MARRIAGES._,"Their love grows colder, and their pleasures cease;"
7353,_MARRIAGES._,"In health just fed, in sickness just relieved;"
7354,_MARRIAGES._,By hardships harass'd and by children grieved;
7355,_MARRIAGES._,In petty quarrels and in peevish strife
7356,_MARRIAGES._,The once fond couple waste the spring of life;                     470
7357,_MARRIAGES._,"But, when to age mature those children grown,"
7358,_MARRIAGES._,"Find hopes and homes and hardships of their own,"
7359,_MARRIAGES._,The harass'd couple feel their lingering woes
7360,_MARRIAGES._,"Receding slowly, till they find repose."
7361,_MARRIAGES._,"Complaints and murmurs then are laid aside,"
7362,_MARRIAGES._,"(By reason these subdued, and those by pride;)"
7363,_MARRIAGES._,"And, taught by care, the patient man and wife"
7364,_MARRIAGES._,Agree to share the bitter-sweet of life;
7365,_MARRIAGES._,"(Life that has sorrow much and sorrow's cure,"
7366,_MARRIAGES._,Where they who most enjoy shall much endure;)                      480
7367,_MARRIAGES._,"Their rest, their labours, duties, sufferings, prayers,"
7368,_MARRIAGES._,"Compose the soul, and fit it for its cares;"
7369,_MARRIAGES._,"Their graves before them, and their griefs behind,"

7690,_BURIALS._,No leave petition'd for the barn's repairs;
7691,_BURIALS._,"Accounts perplex'd, my interest yet unpaid,"
7692,_BURIALS._,"My mind unsettled, and my will unmade;                             180"
7693,_BURIALS._,"A lawyer, haste, and, in your way, a priest;"
7694,_BURIALS._,"And let me die in one good work at least."""
7695,_BURIALS._,"She spake, and, trembling, dropp'd upon her knees,"
7696,_BURIALS._,"Heaven in her eye, and in her hand her keys;"
7697,_BURIALS._,"And still the more she found her life decay,"
7698,_BURIALS._,With greater force she grasp'd those signs of sway:
7699,_BURIALS._,"Then fell and died!--In haste her sons drew near,"
7700,_BURIALS._,"And dropp'd, in haste, the tributary tear;"
7701,_BURIALS._,"Then from th' adhering clasp the keys unbound,"
7702,_BURIALS._,And consolation for their sorrows found.                           190
7703,_BURIALS._,
7704,_BURIALS._,Death has his infant-train; his bony arm
7705,_BURIALS._,Strikes from the baby-cheek the rosy charm;
7706,_BURIALS._,"The brightest eye his glazing film makes dim,"
7707,_BURIALS._,And his cold touch sets fast the lithest limb:
7708,_BURIALS._,"He seized the sick'ning boy to Gerard lent[25],"
7709,_BURIALS._,"When three days' life, in feeble cries, were spent;"
7710,_BURIALS._,"In pain brought forth, those painful hours to stay,"
7711,_BURIALS._,To breathe in pain and sigh its soul away!
7712,_BURIALS._,"""But why thus lent, if thus recall'd again,"
7713,_BURIALS._,"To cause and feel, to live and die, in pain?""                      200"
7714,_BURIALS._,"Or rather say, Why grievous these appear,"
7715,_BURIALS._,If all it pays for Heaven's eternal year;
7716,_BURIALS._,If these sad sobs and piteous sighs secure
7717,_BURIALS._,"Delights that live, when worlds no more endure?"
7718,_BURIALS._,"The sister-spirit long may lodge below,"
7719,_BURIALS._,"And pains from nature, pains from reason, know;"
7720,_BURIALS._,"Through all the common ills of life may run,"
7721,_BURIALS._,By hope perverted and by love undone;
7722,_BURIALS._,"A wife's distress, a mother's pangs, may dread,"
7723,_BURIALS._,"And widow-tears, in bitter anguish, shed;                          210"
7724,_BURIALS._,"May at old age arrive through numerous harms,"
7725,_BURIALS._,With children's children in those feeble arms:
7726,_BURIALS._,"Nor, till by years of want and grief oppress'd,"
7727,_BURIALS._,Shall the sad spirit flee and be at rest!
7728,_BURIALS._,"Yet happier therefore shall we deem the boy,"
7729,_BURIALS._,Secured from anxious care and dangerous joy?
7730,_BURIALS._,Not so! for then would Love Divine in vain
7731,_BURIALS._,Send all the burthens weary men sustain;
7732,_BURIALS._,"All that now curb the passions when they rage,"
7733,_BURIALS._,The checks of youth and the regrets of age;                        220
7734,_BURIALS._,"All that now bid us hope, believe, endure,"
7735,_BURIALS._,Our sorrow's comfort and our vice's cure;
7736,_BURIALS._,"All that for Heaven's high joys the spirits train,"
7737,_BURIALS._,"And charity, the crown of all, were vain."
7738,_BURIALS._,"Say, will you call the breathless infant bless'd,"
7739,_BURIALS._,Because no cares the silent grave molest?
7740,_BURIALS._,So would you deem the nursling from the wing
7741,_BURIALS._,Untimely thrust and never train'd to sing;
7742,_BURIALS._,But far more bless'd the bird whose grateful voice
7743,_BURIALS._,"Sings its own joy and makes the woods rejoice,                     230"
7744,_BURIALS._,"Though, while untaught, ere yet he charm'd the ear,"
7745,_BURIALS._,Hard were his trials and his pains severe!
7746,_BURIALS._,
7747,_BURIALS._,Next died the Lady who yon Hall possess'd;
7748,_BURIALS._,And here they brought her noble bones to rest.
7749,_BURIALS._,In Town she dwelt;--forsaken stood the Hall:
7750,_BURIALS._,"Worms ate the floors, the tap'stry fled the wall;"
7751,_BURIALS._,No fire the kitchen's cheerless grate display'd;
7752,_BURIALS._,No cheerful light the long-closed sash convey'd;
7753,_BURIALS._,"The crawling worm, that turns a summer-fly,"
7754,_BURIALS._,Here spun his shroud and laid him up to die                        240
7755,_BURIALS._,"The winter-death:--upon the bed of state,"
7756,_BURIALS._,The bat shrill-shrieking woo'd his flickering mate;
7757,_BURIALS._,"To empty rooms the curious came no more,                             }"
7758,_BURIALS._,"From empty cellars turn'd the angry poor,                            }"
7759,_BURIALS._,And surly beggars cursed the ever-bolted door.                       }
7760,_BURIALS._,"To one small room the steward found his way,"
7761,_BURIALS._,Where tenants follow'd to complain and pay;
7762,_BURIALS._,"Yet no complaint before the Lady came,"
7763,_BURIALS._,The feeling servant spared the feeble dame;
7764,_BURIALS._,"Who saw her farms with his observing eyes,                         250"
7765,_BURIALS._,And answer'd all requests with his replies.
7766,_BURIALS._,"She came not down, her falling groves to view;"
7767,_BURIALS._,"Why should she know, what one so faithful knew?"
7768,_BURIALS._,"Why come, from many clamorous tongues to hear,"
7769,_BURIALS._,What one so just might whisper in her ear?
7770,_BURIALS._,Her oaks or acres why with care explore;
7771,_BURIALS._,"Why learn the wants, the sufferings of the poor;"
7772,_BURIALS._,"When one so knowing all their worth could trace,"
7773,_BURIALS._,And one so piteous govern'd in her place?
7774,_BURIALS._,"Lo! now, what dismal sons of Darkness come,                      260"
7775,_BURIALS._,To bear this daughter of Indulgence home;
7776,_BURIALS._,"Tragedians all, and well arranged in black!"
7777,_BURIALS._,"Who nature, feeling, force, expression lack;"
7778,_BURIALS._,"Who cause no tear, but gloomily pass by,"
7779,_BURIALS._,"And shake their sables in the wearied eye,"
7780,_BURIALS._,"That turns disgusted from the pompous scene,"
7781,_BURIALS._,"Proud without grandeur, with profusion, mean!"
7782,_BURIALS._,The tear for kindness past affection owes;
7783,_BURIALS._,For worth deceased the sigh from reason flows;
7784,_BURIALS._,"E'en well-feign'd passion[s] for our sorrows call,                 270"
7785,_BURIALS._,And real tears for mimic miseries fall--
7786,_BURIALS._,"But this poor farce has neither truth nor art,"
7787,_BURIALS._,To please the fancy or to touch the heart;
7788,_BURIALS._,"Unlike the darkness of the sky, that pours"
7789,_BURIALS._,On the dry ground its fertilizing showers;
7790,_BURIALS._,"Unlike to that which strikes the soul with dread,"
7791,_BURIALS._,When thunders roar and forky fires are shed;
7792,_BURIALS._,"Dark but not awful, dismal but yet mean,"
7793,_BURIALS._,With anxious bustle moves the cumbrous scene;
7794,_BURIALS._,"Presents no objects tender or profound,                            280"
7795,_BURIALS._,But spreads its cold unmeaning gloom around.
7796,_BURIALS._,"When woes are feign'd, how ill such forms appear;"
7797,_BURIALS._,"And oh! how needless, when the wo's sincere."
7798,_BURIALS._,"Slow to the vault they come, with heavy tread,"
7799,_BURIALS._,Bending beneath the Lady and her lead;
7800,_BURIALS._,"A case of elm surrounds that ponderous chest,"
7801,_BURIALS._,Close on that case the crimson velvet's press'd;
7802,_BURIALS._,"Ungenerous this, that to the worm denies,"
7803,_BURIALS._,"With niggard-caution, his appointed prize;"
7804,_BURIALS._,"For now, ere yet he works his tedious way,                         290"
7805,_BURIALS._,"Through cloth and wood and metal to his prey,"
7806,_BURIALS._,"That prey dissolving shall a mass remain,"
7807,_BURIALS._,That fancy loathes and worms themselves disdain.
7808,_BURIALS._,"But see! the master-mourner makes his way,"
7809,_BURIALS._,To end his office for the coffin'd clay;
7810,_BURIALS._,Pleased that our rustic men and maids behold
7811,_BURIALS._,"His plate like silver, and his studs like gold,"
7812,_BURIALS._,"As they approach to spell the age, the name,"
7813,_BURIALS._,And all the titles of th' illustrious dame.--
7814,_BURIALS._,"This as (my duty done) some scholar read,                          300"
7815,_BURIALS._,A village-father look'd disdain and said:
7816,_BURIALS._,"""Away, my friends! why take such pains to know"
7817,_BURIALS._,What some brave marble soon in church shall show?
7818,_BURIALS._,"Where not alone her gracious name shall stand,"
7819,_BURIALS._,But how she lived--the blessing of the land;
7820,_BURIALS._,"How much we all deplored the noble dead,"
7821,_BURIALS._,What groans we utter'd and what tears we shed;
7822,_BURIALS._,"Tears, true as those, which in the sleepy eyes"
7823,_BURIALS._,Of weeping cherubs on the stone shall rise;
7824,_BURIALS._,"Tears, true as those, which, ere she found her grave,              310"
7825,_BURIALS._,"The noble Lady to our sorrows gave."""
7826,_BURIALS._,
7827,_BURIALS._,"Down by the church-way walk, and where the brook"
7828,_BURIALS._,"Winds round the chancel like a shepherd's crook,"
7829,_BURIALS._,"In that small house, with those green pales before,"
7830,_BURIALS._,Where jasmine trails on either side the door;
7831,_BURIALS._,"Where those dark shrubs that now grow wild at will,"
7832,_BURIALS._,Were clipp'd in form and tantalized with skill;
7833,_BURIALS._,"Where cockles blanch'd and pebbles neatly spread,"
7834,_BURIALS._,Form'd shining borders for the larkspurs' bed--
7835,_BURIALS._,"There lived a Lady, wise, austere, and nice,                       320"
7836,_BURIALS._,Who show'd her virtue by her scorn of vice.
7837,_BURIALS._,"In the dear fashions of her youth she dress'd,"
7838,_BURIALS._,A pea-green Joseph was her favourite vest;
7839,_BURIALS._,"Erect she stood, she walk'd with stately mien,"
7840,_BURIALS._,"Tight was her length of stays, and she was tall and lean."
7841,_BURIALS._,"There long she lived in maiden-state immured,"
7842,_BURIALS._,From looks of love and treacherous man secured;
7843,_BURIALS._,Though evil fame (but that was long before)
7844,_BURIALS._,Had blown her dubious blast at Catherine's door.
7845,_BURIALS._,"A Captain thither, rich from India, came,                          330"
7846,_BURIALS._,"And though a cousin call'd, it touch'd her fame:"
7847,_BURIALS._,"Her annual stipend rose from his behest,"
7848,_BURIALS._,And all the long-prized treasures she possess'd:--
7849,_BURIALS._,If aught like joy awhile appear'd to stay
7850,_BURIALS._,"In that stern face, and chase those frowns away,"
7851,_BURIALS._,"'Twas when her treasures she disposed for view,"
7852,_BURIALS._,And heard the praises to their splendour due;
7853,_BURIALS._,"Silks beyond price, so rich, they'd stand alone,"
7854,_BURIALS._,And diamonds blazing on the buckled zone;
7855,_BURIALS._,"Rows of rare pearls by curious workmen set,                        340"
7856,_BURIALS._,And bracelets fair in box of glossy jet;
7857,_BURIALS._,"Bright polish'd amber precious from its size,"
7858,_BURIALS._,Or forms the fairest fancy could devise.
7859,_BURIALS._,"Her drawers of cedar, shut with secret springs,"
7860,_BURIALS._,Conceal'd the watch of gold and rubied rings;
7861,_BURIALS._,"Letters, long proofs of love, and verses fine"
7862,_BURIALS._,Round the pink'd rims of crisped Valentine.
7863,_BURIALS._,"Her china-closet, cause of daily care,"
7864,_BURIALS._,For woman's wonder held her pencill'd ware;
7865,_BURIALS._,"That pictured wealth of China and Japan,                           350"
7866,_BURIALS._,"Like its cold mistress, shunn'd the eye of man."
7867,_BURIALS._,"Her neat small room, adorn'd with maiden-taste,"
7868,_BURIALS._,"A clipp'd French puppy, first of favourites, graced;"
7869,_BURIALS._,"A parrot next, but dead and stuff'd with art;"
7870,_BURIALS._,"(For Poll, when living, lost the Lady's heart,"
7871,_BURIALS._,And then his life; for he was heard to speak
7872,_BURIALS._,Such frightful words as tinged his Lady's cheek;)
7873,_BURIALS._,"Unhappy bird! who had no power to prove,"
7874,_BURIALS._,"Save by such speech, his gratitude and love."
7875,_BURIALS._,A grey old cat his whiskers lick'd beside;                         360
7876,_BURIALS._,A type of sadness in the house of pride.
7877,_BURIALS._,"The polish'd surface of an India chest,"
7878,_BURIALS._,"A glassy globe, in frame of ivory, press'd;"
7879,_BURIALS._,"Where swam two finny creatures: one of gold,"
7880,_BURIALS._,"Of silver one, both beauteous to behold."
7881,_BURIALS._,All these were form'd the guiding taste to suit;
7882,_BURIALS._,The beasts well-manner'd and the fishes mute.
7883,_BURIALS._,"A widow'd Aunt was there, compelled by need"
7884,_BURIALS._,The nymph to flatter and her tribe to feed;
7885,_BURIALS._,"Who, veiling well her scorn, endured the clog,                     370"
7886,_BURIALS._,Mute as the fish and fawning as the dog.
7887,_BURIALS._,"As years increased, these treasures, her delight,"
7888,_BURIALS._,Arose in value in their owner's sight:
7889,_BURIALS._,"A miser knows that, view it as he will,"
7890,_BURIALS._,A guinea kept is but a guinea still;
7891,_BURIALS._,"And so he puts it to its proper use,"
7892,_BURIALS._,That something more this guinea may produce:
7893,_BURIALS._,"But silks and rings, in the possessor's eyes,"
7894,_BURIALS._,"The oft'ner seen, the more in value rise,"
7895,_BURIALS._,And thus are wisely hoarded to bestow                              380
7896,_BURIALS._,The kind of pleasure that with years will grow.
7897,_BURIALS._,But what avail'd their worth--if worth had they--
7898,_BURIALS._,In the sad summer of her slow decay?
7899,_BURIALS._,Then we beheld her turn an anxious look
7900,_BURIALS._,"From trunks and chests, and fix it on her book--"
7901,_BURIALS._,"A rich-bound Book of Prayer the Captain gave,"
7902,_BURIALS._,"(Some Princess had it, or was said to have;)"
7903,_BURIALS._,"And then once more, on all her stores, look round,"
7904,_BURIALS._,"And draw a sigh so piteous and profound,"
7905,_BURIALS._,"That told, ""Alas! how hard from these to part,                     390"
7906,_BURIALS._,And for new hopes and habits form the heart!
7907,_BURIALS._,"What shall I do,"" (she cried,) ""my peace of mind"
7908,_BURIALS._,"To gain in dying, and to die resign'd?"""
7909,_BURIALS._,"""Hear,"" we return'd;--""these baubles cast aside,"
7910,_BURIALS._,Nor give thy God a rival in thy pride;
7911,_BURIALS._,"Thy closets shut, and ope thy kitchen's door;"
7912,_BURIALS._,"_There_ own thy failings, _here_ invite the poor;"
7913,_BURIALS._,A friend of Mammon let thy bounty make;                              }
7914,_BURIALS._,For widows' prayers thy vanities forsake;                            }
7915,_BURIALS._,And let the hungry of thy pride partake:                         400 }
7916,_BURIALS._,Then shall thy inward eye with joy survey
7917,_BURIALS._,"The angel Mercy tempering Death's delay!"""
7918,_BURIALS._,"Alas! 'twas hard; the treasures still had charms,"
7919,_BURIALS._,"Hope still its flattery, sickness its alarms;"
7920,_BURIALS._,"Still was the same unsettled, clouded view,"
7921,_BURIALS._,"And the same plaintive cry, ""What shall I do?"""
7922,_BURIALS._,"Nor change appear'd: for when her race was run,"
7923,_BURIALS._,"Doubtful we all exclaim'd, ""What has been done?"""
7924,_BURIALS._,"Apart she lived, and still she lies alone;"
7925,_BURIALS._,"Yon earthy heap awaits the flattering stone,                       410"
7926,_BURIALS._,"On which invention shall be long employ'd,"
7927,_BURIALS._,To show the various worth of Catherine Lloyd.
7928,_BURIALS._,
7929,_BURIALS._,"Next to these ladies, but in nought allied,"
7930,_BURIALS._,"A noble Peasant, Isaac Ashford, died."
7931,_BURIALS._,"Noble he was, contemning all things mean,"
7932,_BURIALS._,His truth unquestion'd and his soul serene;
7933,_BURIALS._,Of no man's presence Isaac felt afraid;
7934,_BURIALS._,At no man's question Isaac look'd dismay'd:
7935,_BURIALS._,"Shame knew him not, he dreaded no disgrace;"
7936,_BURIALS._,"Truth, simple truth, was written in his face;                      420"
7937,_BURIALS._,"Yet while the serious thought his soul approved,"
7938,_BURIALS._,"Cheerful he seem'd, and gentleness he loved."
7939,_BURIALS._,"To bliss domestic he his heart resign'd,"
7940,_BURIALS._,"And, with the firmest, had the fondest mind."
7941,_BURIALS._,"Were others joyful, he look'd smiling on,"
7942,_BURIALS._,And gave allowance where he needed none;
7943,_BURIALS._,"Good he refused with future ill to buy,"
7944,_BURIALS._,Nor knew a joy that caused reflection's sigh;
7945,_BURIALS._,"A friend to virtue, his unclouded breast"
7946,_BURIALS._,"No envy stung, no jealousy distress'd;                             430"
7947,_BURIALS._,"(Bane of the poor! it wounds their weaker mind,"
7948,_BURIALS._,To miss one favour which their neighbours find.)
7949,_BURIALS._,Yet far was he from stoic pride removed;
7950,_BURIALS._,"He felt humanely, and he warmly loved."
7951,_BURIALS._,"I mark'd his action, when his infant died,"
7952,_BURIALS._,And his old neighbour for offence was tried;
7953,_BURIALS._,"The still tears, stealing down that furrow'd cheek,"
7954,_BURIALS._,"Spoke pity, plainer than the tongue can speak."
7955,_BURIALS._,"If pride were his, 'twas not their vulgar pride,"
7956,_BURIALS._,"Who, in their base contempt, the great deride;                     440"
7957,_BURIALS._,"Nor pride in learning,--though my clerk agreed,"
7958,_BURIALS._,"If fate should call him, Ashford might succeed;"
7959,_BURIALS._,"Nor pride in rustic skill, although we knew"
7960,_BURIALS._,"None his superior, and his equals few:--"
7961,_BURIALS._,"But, if that spirit in his soul had place,"
7962,_BURIALS._,It was the jealous pride that shuns disgrace:
7963,_BURIALS._,"A pride in honest fame, by virtue gain'd,"
7964,_BURIALS._,In sturdy boys to virtuous labours train'd;
7965,_BURIALS._,"Pride in the power that guards his country's coast,"
7966,_BURIALS._,And all that Englishmen enjoy and boast;                           450
7967,_BURIALS._,"Pride in a life that slander's tongue defied,--"
7968,_BURIALS._,"In fact, a noble passion, misnamed pride."
7969,_BURIALS._,"He had no party's rage, no sect'ry's whim;"
7970,_BURIALS._,Christian and countryman was all with him.
7971,_BURIALS._,True to his church he came; no Sunday-shower
7972,_BURIALS._,Kept him at home in that important hour;
7973,_BURIALS._,"Nor his firm feet could one persuading sect,"
7974,_BURIALS._,"By the strong glare of their new light, direct;--"
7975,_BURIALS._,"""On hope, in mine own sober light, I gaze,"
7976,_BURIALS._,"But should be blind and lose it, in your blaze.""                   460"
7977,_BURIALS._,"In times severe, when many a sturdy swain"
7978,_BURIALS._,"Felt it his pride, his comfort, to complain,"
7979,_BURIALS._,"Isaac their wants would soothe, his own would hide,"
7980,_BURIALS._,And feel in that his comfort and his pride.
7981,_BURIALS._,"At length he found, when seventy years were run,"
7982,_BURIALS._,"His strength departed, and his labour done;"
7983,_BURIALS._,"When he, save honest fame, retain'd no more,"
7984,_BURIALS._,But lost his wife and saw his children poor:
7985,_BURIALS._,"'Twas then, a spark of--say not, discontent--"
7986,_BURIALS._,"Struck on his mind, and thus he gave it vent:                      470"
7987,_BURIALS._,"""Kind are your laws, ('tis not to be denied,)"
7988,_BURIALS._,"That in yon house for ruin'd age provide,"
7989,_BURIALS._,"And they are just;--when young, we give you all,"
7990,_BURIALS._,And for assistance in our weakness call.--
7991,_BURIALS._,"Why then this proud reluctance to be fed,"
7992,_BURIALS._,"To join your poor, and eat the parish-bread?"
7993,_BURIALS._,"But yet I linger, loth with him to feed,"
7994,_BURIALS._,Who gains his plenty by the sons of need;
7995,_BURIALS._,"He who, by contract, all your paupers took,"
7996,_BURIALS._,And gauges stomachs with an anxious look.                          480
7997,_BURIALS._,On some old master I could well depend;
7998,_BURIALS._,See him with joy and thank him as a friend;
7999,_BURIALS._,"But ill on him, who doles the day's supply,"
8000,_BURIALS._,"And counts our chances, who at night may die:"
8001,_BURIALS._,"Yet help me, Heav'n! and let me not complain"
8002,_BURIALS._,"Of what I suffer, but my fate sustain."""
8003,_BURIALS._,"Such were his thoughts, and so resign'd he grew;"
8004,_BURIALS._,Daily he placed the workhouse in his view!
8005,_BURIALS._,"But came not there, for sudden was his fate:"
8006,_BURIALS._,"He dropp'd, expiring, at his cottage-gate.                         490"
8007,_BURIALS._,"I feel his absence in the hours of prayer,"
8008,_BURIALS._,And view his seat and sigh for Isaac there:
8009,_BURIALS._,I see no more those white locks thinly spread
8010,_BURIALS._,Round the bald polish of that honoured head;
8011,_BURIALS._,"No more that awful glance on playful wight,"
8012,_BURIALS._,"Compell'd to kneel and tremble at the sight,"
8013,_BURIALS._,"To fold his fingers, all in dread the while,"
8014,_BURIALS._,Till Mister Ashford soften'd to a smile;
8015,_BURIALS._,"No more that meek and suppliant look in prayer,"
8016,_BURIALS._,"Nor the pure faith (to give it force), are there;--                500"
8017,_BURIALS._,"But he is bless'd, and I lament no more"
8018,_BURIALS._,"A wise good man, contented to be poor."
8019,_BURIALS._,
8020,_BURIALS._,Then died a Rambler: not the one who sails
8021,_BURIALS._,"And trucks, for female favours, beads and nails;"
8022,_BURIALS._,"Not one, who posts from place to place--of men"
8023,_BURIALS._,And manners treating with a flying pen;
8024,_BURIALS._,"Not he, who climbs, for prospects, Snowd[o]n's height,"
8025,_BURIALS._,And chides the clouds that intercept the sight;
8026,_BURIALS._,"No curious shell, rare plant, or brilliant spar,"
8027,_BURIALS._,Enticed our traveller from his home so far;                        500
8028,_BURIALS._,"But all the reason, by himself assign'd"
8029,_BURIALS._,"For so much rambling, was, a restless mind;"
8030,_BURIALS._,"As on, from place to place, without intent,"
8031,_BURIALS._,"Without reflection, Robin Dingley went."
8032,_BURIALS._,Not thus by nature;--never man was found
8033,_BURIALS._,Less prone to wander from his parish-bound:
8034,_BURIALS._,"Claudian's old Man, to whom all scenes were new,"
8035,_BURIALS._,"Save those where he and where his apples grew,"
8036,_BURIALS._,"Resembled Robin, who around would look,"
8037,_BURIALS._,And his horizon for the earth's mistook.                           520
8038,_BURIALS._,To this poor swain a keen Attorney came:--
8039,_BURIALS._,"""I give thee joy, good fellow! on thy name;"
8040,_BURIALS._,"The rich old Dingley's dead;--no child has he,"
8041,_BURIALS._,"Nor wife, nor will; his ALL is left for thee:"
8042,_BURIALS._,To be his fortune's heir thy claim is good;
8043,_BURIALS._,"Thou hast the name, and we will prove the blood."""
8044,_BURIALS._,The claim was made; 'twas tried--it would not stand;
8045,_BURIALS._,"They proved the blood, but were refused the land."
8046,_BURIALS._,"Assured of wealth, this man of simple heart,"
8047,_BURIALS._,To every friend had predisposed a part:                            530
8048,_BURIALS._,His wife had hopes indulged of various kind;
8049,_BURIALS._,"The three Miss Dingleys had their school assign'd,"
8050,_BURIALS._,"Masters were sought for what they each required,"
8051,_BURIALS._,And books were bought and harpsichords were hired:
8052,_BURIALS._,"So high was hope;--the failure touch'd his brain,"
8053,_BURIALS._,And Robin never was himself again.
8054,_BURIALS._,"Yet he no wrath, no angry wish express'd,"
8055,_BURIALS._,"But tried, in vain, to labour or to rest;"
8056,_BURIALS._,"Then cast his bundle on his back, and went"
8057,_BURIALS._,"He knew not whither, nor for what intent.                          540"
8058,_BURIALS._,"Years fled;--of Robin all remembrance past,"
8059,_BURIALS._,When home he wander'd in his rags at last.
8060,_BURIALS._,"A sailor's jacket on his limbs was thrown,"
8061,_BURIALS._,A sailor's story he had made his own;
8062,_BURIALS._,"Had suffer'd battles, prisons, tempests, storms,"
8063,_BURIALS._,Encountering death in all his ugliest forms.
8064,_BURIALS._,"His cheeks were haggard, hollow was his eye,"
8065,_BURIALS._,"Where madness lurk'd, conceal'd in misery;"
8066,_BURIALS._,"Want, and th' ungentle world, had taught a part,"
8067,_BURIALS._,And prompted cunning to that simple heart:                         550
8068,_BURIALS._,"He now bethought him, he would roam no more,"
8069,_BURIALS._,But live at home and labour as before.
8070,_BURIALS._,"Here clothed and fed, no sooner he began"
8071,_BURIALS._,"To round and redden, than away he ran;"
8072,_BURIALS._,"His wife was dead, their children past his aid:"
8073,_BURIALS._,"So, unmolested, from his home he stray'd."
8074,_BURIALS._,"Six years elapsed, when, worn with want and pain,"
8075,_BURIALS._,"Came Robin, wrapt in all his rags, again.--"
8076,_BURIALS._,"We chide, we pity;--placed among our poor,"
8077,_BURIALS._,"He fed again, and was a man once more.                             560"
8078,_BURIALS._,"As when a gaunt and hungry fox is found,"
8079,_BURIALS._,Entrapp'd alive in some rich hunter's ground;
8080,_BURIALS._,"Fed for the field, although each day's a feast,"
8081,_BURIALS._,"_Fatten_ you may, but never _tame_ the beast;"
8082,_BURIALS._,"A house protects him, savoury viands sustain;"
8083,_BURIALS._,But loose his neck and off he goes again:
8084,_BURIALS._,"So stole our vagrant from his warm retreat,"
8085,_BURIALS._,To rove a prowler and be deem'd a cheat.
8086,_BURIALS._,"Hard was his fare; for, him at length we saw,"
8087,_BURIALS._,In cart convey'd and laid supine on straw.                         570
8088,_BURIALS._,His feeble voice now spoke a sinking heart;
8089,_BURIALS._,His groans now told the motions of the cart;
8090,_BURIALS._,"And when it stopp'd, he tried in vain to stand;"
8091,_BURIALS._,"Closed was his eye, and clench'd his clammy hand;"
8092,_BURIALS._,"Life ebb'd apace, and our best aid no more"
8093,_BURIALS._,Could his weak sense or dying heart restore:
8094,_BURIALS._,"But now he fell, a victim to the snare,"
8095,_BURIALS._,That vile attorneys for the weak prepare--
8096,_BURIALS._,"They who, when profit or resentment call,"
8097,_BURIALS._,Heed not the groaning victim they enthrall.                        580
8098,_BURIALS._,
8099,_BURIALS._,"Then died lamented, in the strength of life,"
8100,_BURIALS._,A valued Mother and a faithful Wife;
8101,_BURIALS._,"Call'd not away, when time had loosed each hold"
8102,_BURIALS._,"On the fond heart, and each desire grew cold;"
8103,_BURIALS._,"But when, to all that knit us to our kind,"
8104,_BURIALS._,"She felt fast-bound, as charity can bind--"
8105,_BURIALS._,"Not, when the ills of age, its pain, its care,"
8106,_BURIALS._,The drooping spirit for its fate prepare;
8107,_BURIALS._,"And each affection, failing, leaves the heart"
8108,_BURIALS._,Loosed from life's charm and willing to depart--                   590
8109,_BURIALS._,"But all her ties the strong invader broke,"
8110,_BURIALS._,"In all their strength, by one tremendous stroke!"
8111,_BURIALS._,"Sudden and swift the eager pest came on,"
8112,_BURIALS._,"And terror grew, till every hope was gone;"
8113,_BURIALS._,Still those around appear'd for hope to seek!
8114,_BURIALS._,"But view'd the sick, and were afraid to speak.--"
8115,_BURIALS._,"Slowly they bore, with solemn step, the dead;"
8116,_BURIALS._,"When grief grew loud and bitter tears were shed,"
8117,_BURIALS._,"My part began; a crowd drew near the place,"
8118,_BURIALS._,"Awe in each eye, alarm in every face:                              600"
8119,_BURIALS._,"So swift the ill, and of so fierce a kind,"
8120,_BURIALS._,That fear with pity mingled in each mind;
8121,_BURIALS._,Friends with the husband came their griefs to blend;
8122,_BURIALS._,For good-man Frankford was to all a friend.
8123,_BURIALS._,The last-born boy they held above the bier;
8124,_BURIALS._,"He knew not grief, but cries express'd his fear;"
8125,_BURIALS._,"Each different age and sex reveal'd its pain,"
8126,_BURIALS._,"In now a louder, now a lower strain;"
8127,_BURIALS._,"While the meek father, listening to their tones,"
8128,_BURIALS._,Swell'd the full cadence of the grief by groans.                   610
8129,_BURIALS._,"The elder sister strove her pangs to hide,"
8130,_BURIALS._,And soothing words to younger minds applied
8131,_BURIALS._,"""Be still, be patient,"" oft she strove to say;"
8132,_BURIALS._,"But fail'd as oft, and weeping turn'd away."
8133,_BURIALS._,"Curious and sad, upon the fresh-dug hill,"
8134,_BURIALS._,The village-lads stood melancholy still;
8135,_BURIALS._,"And idle children, wandering to-and-fro,"
8136,_BURIALS._,"As Nature guided, took the tone of wo."
8137,_BURIALS._,"Arrived at home, how then they gazed around,"
8138,_BURIALS._,In every place--where she no more was found;                       620
8139,_BURIALS._,The seat at table she was wont to fill;
8140,_BURIALS._,"The fire-side chair, still set, but vacant still;"
8141,_BURIALS._,"The garden-walks, a labour all her own,"
8142,_BURIALS._,"The latticed bower, with trailing shrubs o'ergrown;"
8143,_BURIALS._,The Sunday-pew she fill'd with all her race--
8144,_BURIALS._,"Each place of hers, was now a sacred place,"
8145,_BURIALS._,"That, while it call'd up sorrows in the eyes,"
8146,_BURIALS._,Pierced the full heart and forced them still to rise.
8147,_BURIALS._,"Oh sacred sorrow! by whom souls are tried,"
8148,_BURIALS._,"Sent not to punish mortals, but to guide;                          630"
8149,_BURIALS._,"If thou art mine, (and who shall proudly dare"
8150,_BURIALS._,"To tell his Maker, he has had his share?)"
8151,_BURIALS._,"Still let me feel for what thy pangs are sent,"
8152,_BURIALS._,And be my guide and not my punishment!
8153,_BURIALS._,
8154,_BURIALS._,"Of Leah Cousins next the name appears,"
8155,_BURIALS._,"With honours crown'd and bless'd with length of years,"
8156,_BURIALS._,"Save that she lived to feel, in life's decay,"
8157,_BURIALS._,"The pleasure die, the honours drop away."
8158,_BURIALS._,"A matron she, whom every village-wife"
8159,_BURIALS._,View'd as the help and guardian of her life;                       640
8160,_BURIALS._,"Fathers and sons, indebted to her aid,"
8161,_BURIALS._,Respect to her and her profession paid;
8162,_BURIALS._,"Who in the house of plenty largely fed,"
8163,_BURIALS._,Yet took her station at the pauper's bed;
8164,_BURIALS._,"Nor from that duty could be bribed again,"
8165,_BURIALS._,While fear or danger urged her to remain.
8166,_BURIALS._,In her experience all her friends relied;
8167,_BURIALS._,Heaven was her help and nature was her guide.
8168,_BURIALS._,"Thus Leah lived, long trusted, much caress'd,"
8169,_BURIALS._,Till a Town-Dame a youthful Farmer bless'd;                        650
8170,_BURIALS._,"A gay vain bride, who would example give"
8171,_BURIALS._,To that poor village where she deign'd to live;
8172,_BURIALS._,"Some few months past, she sent, in hour of need,"
8173,_BURIALS._,"For Doctor Glibb, who came with wond'rous speed:"
8174,_BURIALS._,"Two days he waited, all his art applied,"
8175,_BURIALS._,To save the mother when her infant died:--
8176,_BURIALS._,"""'Twas well I came,"" at last he deign'd to say;"
8177,_BURIALS._,"""'Twas wondrous well""--and proudly rode away."
8178,_BURIALS._,"The news ran round:--""How vast the Doctor's pow'r!"
8179,_BURIALS._,He saved the Lady in the trying hour;                              660
8180,_BURIALS._,"Saved her from death, when she was dead to hope,"
8181,_BURIALS._,And her fond husband had resign'd her up:
8182,_BURIALS._,"So all, like her, may evil fate defy,"
8183,_BURIALS._,"If Doctor Glibb, with saving hand, be nigh."""
8184,_BURIALS._,"Fame (now his friend), fear, novelty, and whim,"
8185,_BURIALS._,"And fashion, sent the varying sex to him:"
8186,_BURIALS._,"From this, contention in the village rose,"
8187,_BURIALS._,"And _these_ the Dame espoused, the Doctor _those_:"
8188,_BURIALS._,"The wealthier part, to him and science went;"
8189,_BURIALS._,With luck and her the poor remain'd content.                       670
8190,_BURIALS._,"The matron sigh'd; for she was vex'd at heart,"
8191,_BURIALS._,"With so much profit, so much fame, to part:"
8192,_BURIALS._,"""So long successful in my art,"" she cried,"
8193,_BURIALS._,"""And this proud man, so young and so untried!"""
8194,_BURIALS._,"""Nay,"" said the Doctor, ""dare you trust your wives,"
8195,_BURIALS._,"The joy, the pride, the solace of your lives,"
8196,_BURIALS._,"To one who acts and knows no reason why,"
8197,_BURIALS._,"But trusts, poor hag! to luck for an ally?--"
8198,_BURIALS._,"Who, on experience, can her claims advance,"
8199,_BURIALS._,And own the powers of accident and chance?                         680
8200,_BURIALS._,"A whining dame, who prays in danger's view,"
8201,_BURIALS._,(A proof she knows not what beside to do;)
8202,_BURIALS._,"What's her experience? In the time that's gone,"
8203,_BURIALS._,"Blundering she wrought, and still she blunders on:--"
8204,_BURIALS._,What is Nature? One who acts in aid
8205,_BURIALS._,"Of gossips half asleep, and half afraid."
8206,_BURIALS._,"With such allies I scorn my fame to blend,"
8207,_BURIALS._,Skill is my luck and courage is my friend;
8208,_BURIALS._,"No slave to Nature, 'tis my chief delight"
8209,_BURIALS._,To win my way and act in her despite:--                            690
8210,_BURIALS._,"""Trust then my art, that, in itself complete,"
8211,_BURIALS._,"Needs no assistance and fears no defeat."""
8212,_BURIALS._,"Warm'd by her well-spiced ale and aiding pipe,"
8213,_BURIALS._,The angry matron grew for contest ripe.
8214,_BURIALS._,"""Can you,"" she said, ""ungrateful and unjust,"
8215,_BURIALS._,"Before experience, ostentation trust!"
8216,_BURIALS._,"What is your hazard, foolish daughters, tell?"
8217,_BURIALS._,"If safe, you're certain; if secure, you're well:"
8218,_BURIALS._,"That I have luck must friend and foe confess,"
8219,_BURIALS._,And what's good judgment but a lucky guess?                        700
8220,_BURIALS._,_He_ boasts but what he _can_ do:--will you run
8221,_BURIALS._,"From me, your friend! who, all _he_ boasts, _have_ done?"
8222,_BURIALS._,By proud and learned words his powers are known;
8223,_BURIALS._,By healthy boys and handsome girls my own.
8224,_BURIALS._,Wives! fathers! children! by my help you live;
8225,_BURIALS._,Has this pale Doctor more than life to give?
8226,_BURIALS._,No stunted cripple hops the village round;
8227,_BURIALS._,Your hands are active and your heads are sound:
8228,_BURIALS._,My lads are all your fields and flocks require;
8229,_BURIALS._,My lasses all those sturdy lads admire.                            710
8230,_BURIALS._,"Can this proud leech, with all his boasted skill,"
8231,_BURIALS._,"Amend the soul or body, wit or will?"
8232,_BURIALS._,"Does he for courts the sons of farmers frame,"
8233,_BURIALS._,Or make the daughter differ from the dame?
8234,_BURIALS._,"Or, whom he brings into this world of wo,"
8235,_BURIALS._,Prepares he them their part to undergo?
8236,_BURIALS._,"If not, this stranger from your doors repel,"
8237,_BURIALS._,"And be content to _be_, and to be _well_."""
8238,_BURIALS._,"She spake; but, ah! with words too strong and plain;"
8239,_BURIALS._,"Her warmth offended, and her truth was vain:                       720"
8240,_BURIALS._,"The _many_ left her, and the friendly _few_,"
8241,_BURIALS._,"If never colder, yet they older grew;"
8242,_BURIALS._,"Till, unemploy'd, she felt her spirits droop,"
8243,_BURIALS._,"And took, insidious aid! th' inspiring cup;"
8244,_BURIALS._,"Grew poor and peevish as her powers decay'd,"
8245,_BURIALS._,And propp'd the tottering frame with stronger aid;--
8246,_BURIALS._,"Then died!--I saw our careful swains convey,"
8247,_BURIALS._,"From this our changeful world, the matron's clay,"
8248,_BURIALS._,"Who to this world, at least, with equal care,"
8249,_BURIALS._,"Brought them its changes, good and ill to share.                   730"
8250,_BURIALS._,"Now to his grave was Roger Cuff convey'd,"
8251,_BURIALS._,And strong resentment's lingering spirit laid.
8252,_BURIALS._,"Shipwreck'd in youth, he home return'd, and found"
8253,_BURIALS._,His brethren three--and thrice they wish'd him drown'd.
8254,_BURIALS._,"""Is this a landman's love? Be certain then,"
8255,_BURIALS._,"We part for ever!""--and they cried, ""Amen!"""
8256,_BURIALS._,His words were truth's.--Some forty summers fled;
8257,_BURIALS._,His brethren died; his kin supposed him dead:
8258,_BURIALS._,"Three nephews these, one sprightly niece, and one,"
8259,_BURIALS._,Less near in blood--they call'd him _surly John_;                  740
8260,_BURIALS._,He work'd in woods apart from all his kind.
8261,_BURIALS._,Fierce were his looks and moody was his mind.
8262,_BURIALS._,For home the Sailor now began to sigh:--
8263,_BURIALS._,"""The dogs are dead, and I'll return and die;"
8264,_BURIALS._,"When all I have, my gains, in years of care,"
8265,_BURIALS._,The younger Cuffs with kinder souls shall share.--
8266,_BURIALS._,"Yet hold! I'm rich;--with one consent they'll say,"
8267,_BURIALS._,"'You're welcome, Uncle, as the flowers in May.'"
8268,_BURIALS._,"No; I'll disguise me, be in tatters dress'd,"
8269,_BURIALS._,"And best befriend the lads who treat me best.""                     750"
8270,_BURIALS._,"Now all his kindred,--neither rich nor poor--"
8271,_BURIALS._,Kept the wolf want some distance from the door.
8272,_BURIALS._,"In piteous plight he knock'd at George's gate,"
8273,_BURIALS._,"And begg'd for aid, as he described his state;--"
8274,_BURIALS._,"But stern was George:--""Let them who had thee strong,"
8275,_BURIALS._,Help thee to drag thy weaken'd frame along;
8276,_BURIALS._,"To us a stranger, while your limbs would move,"
8277,_BURIALS._,From us depart and try a stranger's love:--
8278,_BURIALS._,"Ha! dost thou murmur?""--for, in Roger's throat,"
8279,_BURIALS._,"Was ""Rascal!"" rising with disdainful note.                         760"
8280,_BURIALS._,To pious James he then his prayer address'd;--
8281,_BURIALS._,"""Good lack,"" quoth James, ""thy sorrows pierce my breast;"
8282,_BURIALS._,"And, had I wealth, as have my brethren twain,"
8283,_BURIALS._,One board should feed us and one roof contain.
8284,_BURIALS._,But plead I will thy cause and I will pray;
8285,_BURIALS._,"And so farewell! Heaven help thee on thy way!"""
8286,_BURIALS._,"""Scoundrel!"" said Roger, (but apart;)--and told"
8287,_BURIALS._,His case to Peter;--Peter too was cold;--
8288,_BURIALS._,"""The rates are high; we have a-many poor;"
8289,_BURIALS._,"But I will think,""--he said, and shut the door.                    770"
8290,_BURIALS._,Then the gay Niece the seeming pauper press'd:--
8291,_BURIALS._,"""Turn, Nancy, turn, and view this form distress'd;"
8292,_BURIALS._,"Akin to thine is this declining frame,"
8293,_BURIALS._,"And this poor beggar claims an Uncle's name."""
8294,_BURIALS._,"""Avaunt! begone!"" the courteous maiden said,"
8295,_BURIALS._,"""Thou vile impostor! Uncle Roger's dead:"
8296,_BURIALS._,"I hate thee, beast; thy look my spirit shocks!"
8297,_BURIALS._,"Oh! that I saw thee starving in the stocks!"""
8298,_BURIALS._,"""My gentle niece!"" he said--and sought the wood.--"
8299,_BURIALS._,"""I hunger, fellow; prithee, give me food!""                         780"
8300,_BURIALS._,"""Give! am I rich? This hatchet take, and try"
8301,_BURIALS._,"Thy proper strength, nor give those limbs the lie;"
8302,_BURIALS._,"Work, feed thyself, to thine own powers appeal,"
8303,_BURIALS._,"Nor whine out woes, thine own right-hand can heal:"
8304,_BURIALS._,"And while that hand is thine and thine a leg,"
8305,_BURIALS._,"Scorn of the proud or of the base to beg."""
8306,_BURIALS._,"""Come, surly John, thy wealthy kinsman view,"""
8307,_BURIALS._,"Old Roger said:--""thy words are brave and true;"
8308,_BURIALS._,"Come, live with me: we'll vex those scoundrel-boys,"
8309,_BURIALS._,"And that prim shrew shall, envying, hear our joys.--               790"
8310,_BURIALS._,"Tobacco's glorious fume all day we'll share,"
8311,_BURIALS._,With beef and brandy kill all kinds of care;
8312,_BURIALS._,"We'll beer and biscuit on our table heap,"
8313,_BURIALS._,"And rail at rascals, till we fall asleep."""
8314,_BURIALS._,"Such was their life; but when the woodman died,"
8315,_BURIALS._,His grieving kin for Roger's smiles applied--
8316,_BURIALS._,"In vain; he shut, with stern rebuke, the door,"
8317,_BURIALS._,"And dying, built a refuge for the poor:"
8318,_BURIALS._,"With this restriction, That no Cuff should share"
8319,_BURIALS._,"One meal, or shelter for one moment there.                         800"
8320,_BURIALS._,
8321,_BURIALS._,My record ends:--But hark! e'en now I hear
8322,_BURIALS._,"The bell of death, and know not whose to fear."
8323,_BURIALS._,"Our farmers all, and all our hinds were well;"
8324,_BURIALS._,In no man's cottage danger seem'd to dwell;--
8325,_BURIALS._,"Yet death of man proclaim these heavy chimes,"
8326,_BURIALS._,"For thrice they sound, with pausing space, three times."
8327,_BURIALS._,"""Go; of my sexton seek, Whose days are sped?--"
8328,_BURIALS._,"""What! he, himself!--and is old Dibble dead?"""
8329,_BURIALS._,"His eightieth year he reach'd, still undecay'd,"
8330,_BURIALS._,And rectors five to one close vault convey'd:--                    810
8331,_BURIALS._,"But he is gone; his care and skill I lose,"
8332,_BURIALS._,And gain a mournful subject for my Muse:
8333,_BURIALS._,"His masters lost, he'd oft in turn deplore,"
8334,_BURIALS._,"And kindly add,--""Heaven grant, I lose no more!"""
8335,_BURIALS._,"Yet, while he spake, a sly and pleasant glance"
8336,_BURIALS._,Appear'd at variance with his complaisance:
8337,_BURIALS._,"For, as he told their fate and varying worth,"
8338,_BURIALS._,"He archly look'd,--""I yet may bear thee forth."""
8339,_BURIALS._,"""When first""--(he so began)--""my trade I plied,"
8340,_BURIALS._,Good master Addle was the parish-guide;                            820
8341,_BURIALS._,"His clerk and sexton, I beheld with fear"
8342,_BURIALS._,"His stride majestic, and his frown severe;"
8343,_BURIALS._,"A noble pillar of the church he stood,"
8344,_BURIALS._,Adorn'd with college-gown and parish-hood.
8345,_BURIALS._,"Then as he paced the hallow'd aisles about,"
8346,_BURIALS._,He fill'd the sevenfold surplice fairly out!
8347,_BURIALS._,"But in his pulpit, wearied down with prayer,"
8348,_BURIALS._,He sat and seem'd as in his study's chair;
8349,_BURIALS._,"For while the anthem swell'd, and when it ceased,"
8350,_BURIALS._,Th' expecting people view'd their slumbering priest:               830
8351,_BURIALS._,"Who, dozing, died.--Our Parson Peele was next;"
8352,_BURIALS._,"'I will not spare you,' was his favourite text;"
8353,_BURIALS._,"Nor did he spare, but raised them many a pound;"
8354,_BURIALS._,Ev'n me he mulct for my poor rood of ground;
8355,_BURIALS._,"Yet cared he nought, but with a gibing speech,"
8356,_BURIALS._,"'What should I do,' quoth he, 'but what _I_ preach?'"
8357,_BURIALS._,His piercing jokes (and he'd a plenteous store)
8358,_BURIALS._,Were daily offer'd both to rich and poor;
8359,_BURIALS._,"His scorn, his love, in playful words he spoke;"
8360,_BURIALS._,"His pity, praise, and promise, were a joke:                        840"
8361,_BURIALS._,"But though so young and bless'd with spirits high,"
8362,_BURIALS._,He died as grave as any judge could die:
8363,_BURIALS._,"The strong attack subdued his lively powers,--"
8364,_BURIALS._,"His was the grave, and Doctor Grandspear ours."
8365,_BURIALS._,Then were there golden times the village round;
8366,_BURIALS._,In his abundance all appear'd t' abound;
8367,_BURIALS._,"Liberal and rich, a plenteous board he spread,"
8368,_BURIALS._,"E'en cool Dissenters at his table fed,"
8369,_BURIALS._,"Who wish'd, and hoped,--and thought a man so kind"
8370,_BURIALS._,"A way to Heaven, though not their own, might find;                 850"
8371,_BURIALS._,"To them, to all, he was polite and free,"
8372,_BURIALS._,"Kind to the poor, and, ah! most kind to me:"
8373,_BURIALS._,"'Ralph,' would he say, 'Ralph Dibble, thou art old;"
8374,_BURIALS._,"That doublet fit, 'twill keep thee from the cold."
8375,_BURIALS._,How does my sexton?--What! the times are hard;
8376,_BURIALS._,"Drive that stout pig, and pen him in thy yard.'"
8377,_BURIALS._,"But most, his rev'rence loved a mirthful jest:--"
8378,_BURIALS._,"'Thy coat is thin; why, man, thou'rt _barely_ dress'd;"
8379,_BURIALS._,It's worn to th' thread; but I have nappy beer;
8380,_BURIALS._,"Clap that within, and see how they will wear!'                     860"
8381,_BURIALS._,"""Gay days were these; but they were quickly past:"
8382,_BURIALS._,"When first he came, we found he cou'dn't last:"
8383,_BURIALS._,A whoreson cough (and at the fall of leaf)
8384,_BURIALS._,Upset him quite;--but what's the gain of grief?
8385,_BURIALS._,"""Then came the Author-Rector; his delight"
8386,_BURIALS._,"Was all in books; to read them, or to write:"
8387,_BURIALS._,"Women and men he strove alike to shun,"
8388,_BURIALS._,"And hurried homeward when his tasks were done,"
8389,_BURIALS._,"Courteous enough, but careless what he said,"
8390,_BURIALS._,For points of learning he reserved his head;                       870
8391,_BURIALS._,"And, when addressing either poor or rich,"
8392,_BURIALS._,He knew no better than his cassock which.
8393,_BURIALS._,"He, like an osier, was of pliant kind,"
8394,_BURIALS._,"Erect by nature, but to bend inclined;"
8395,_BURIALS._,"Not like a creeper falling to the ground,"
8396,_BURIALS._,Or meanly catching on the neighbours round.--
8397,_BURIALS._,"Careless was he of surplice, hood, and band--"
8398,_BURIALS._,And kindly took them as they came to hand;
8399,_BURIALS._,"Nor, like the doctor, wore a world of hat,"
8400,_BURIALS._,As if he sought for dignity in that.                               880
8401,_BURIALS._,"He talk'd, he gave, but not with cautious rules,"
8402,_BURIALS._,"Nor turn'd from gipsies, vagabonds, or fools;"
8403,_BURIALS._,"It was his nature, but they thought it whim,"
8404,_BURIALS._,And so our beaux and beauties turn'd from him.
8405,_BURIALS._,"Of questions much he wrote, profound and dark--"
8406,_BURIALS._,"How spake the serpent, and where stopp'd the ark;"
8407,_BURIALS._,From what far land the Queen of Sheba came;
8408,_BURIALS._,"Who Salem's priest, and what his father's name;"
8409,_BURIALS._,"He made the Song of Songs its mysteries yield,"
8410,_BURIALS._,"And Revelations, to the world, reveal'd.                           890"
8411,_BURIALS._,He sleeps i' the aisle--but not a stone records
8412,_BURIALS._,"His name or fame, his actions or his words:"
8413,_BURIALS._,"And, truth, your reverence, when I look around,"
8414,_BURIALS._,"And mark the tombs in our sepulchral ground,"
8415,_BURIALS._,"(Though dare I not of one man's hope to doubt),"
8416,_BURIALS._,"I'd join the party who repose without,"
8417,_BURIALS._,"""Next came a youth from Cambridge, and, in truth,"
8418,_BURIALS._,He was a sober and a comely youth;
8419,_BURIALS._,"He blush'd in meekness as a modest man,"
8420,_BURIALS._,And gain'd attention ere his task began;                           900
8421,_BURIALS._,"When preaching, seldom ventured on reproof,"
8422,_BURIALS._,But touch'd his neighbours tenderly enough.
8423,_BURIALS._,"Him, in his youth, a clamorous sect assail'd,"
8424,_BURIALS._,"Advised and censured, flatter'd,--and prevail'd.--"
8425,_BURIALS._,"Then did he much his sober hearers vex,"
8426,_BURIALS._,"Confound the simple, and the sad perplex;"
8427,_BURIALS._,To a new style his reverence rashly took;
8428,_BURIALS._,"Loud grew his voice, to threat'ning swell'd his look;"
8429,_BURIALS._,"Above, below, on either side, he gazed,"
8430,_BURIALS._,"Amazing all, and most himself amazed:                              910"
8431,_BURIALS._,"No more he read his preachments pure and plain,"
8432,_BURIALS._,"But launch'd outright, and rose and sank again:"
8433,_BURIALS._,"At times he smiled in scorn, at times he wept,                       }"
8434,_BURIALS._,"And such sad coil with words of vengeance kept,                      }"
8435,_BURIALS._,That our best sleepers started as they slept.                        }
8436,_BURIALS._,"""'Conviction comes like lightning,' he would cry;"
8437,_BURIALS._,"'In vain you seek it, and in vain you fly;"
8438,_BURIALS._,"'Tis like the rushing of the mighty wind,"
8439,_BURIALS._,"Unseen its progress, but its power you find;"
8440,_BURIALS._,It strikes the child ere yet its reason wakes;                     920
8441,_BURIALS._,"His reason fled, the ancient sire it shakes."
8442,_BURIALS._,"The proud, learn'd man, and him who loves to know"
8443,_BURIALS._,"How and from whence these gusts of grace will blow,"
8444,_BURIALS._,"It shuns,--but sinners in their way impedes,"
8445,_BURIALS._,And sots and harlots visits in their deeds:
8446,_BURIALS._,Of faith and penance it supplies the place;                          }
8447,_BURIALS._,"Assures the vilest that they live by grace,                          }"
8448,_BURIALS._,"And, without running, makes them win the race.'                      }"
8449,_BURIALS._,"""Such was the doctrine our young prophet taught;"
8450,_BURIALS._,"And here conviction, there confusion wrought;                      930"
8451,_BURIALS._,"When his thin cheek assumed a deadly hue,"
8452,_BURIALS._,And all the rose to one small spot withdrew:
8453,_BURIALS._,"They call'd it hectic; 'twas a fiery flush,"
8454,_BURIALS._,More fix'd and deeper than the maiden blush;
8455,_BURIALS._,"His paler lips the pearly teeth disclosed,"
8456,_BURIALS._,And lab'ring lungs the length'ning speech opposed.
8457,_BURIALS._,No more his span-girth shanks and quiv'ring thighs
8458,_BURIALS._,Upheld a body of the smaller size;
8459,_BURIALS._,"But down he sank upon his dying bed,"
8460,_BURIALS._,And gloomy crotchets fill'd his wandering head.--                  940
8461,_BURIALS._,"""'Spite of my faith, all-saving faith,' he cried,"
8462,_BURIALS._,'I fear of worldly works the wicked pride;
8463,_BURIALS._,"Poor as I am, degraded, abject, blind,"
8464,_BURIALS._,The good I've wrought still rankles in my mind;
8465,_BURIALS._,"My alms-deeds all, and every deed I've done,"
8466,_BURIALS._,"My moral-rags defile me, every one;"
8467,_BURIALS._,"It should not be--what say'st thou? tell me, Ralph.'"
8468,_BURIALS._,"Quoth I, 'Your reverence, I believe, you're safe;"
8469,_BURIALS._,"Your faith's your prop, nor have you pass'd such time"
8470,_BURIALS._,In life's good-works as swell them to a crime.                     950
8471,_BURIALS._,"If I of pardon for my sins were sure,"
8472,_BURIALS._,About my goodness I would rest secure.'
8473,_BURIALS._,"""Such was his end; and mine approaches fast;"
8474,_BURIALS._,"I've seen my best of preachers--and my last.""--"
8475,_BURIALS._,"He bow'd, and archly smiled at what he said,"
8476,_BURIALS._,"Civil but sly:--""And is old Dibble dead?"""
8477,_BURIALS._,Yes! he is gone: and WE are going all;
8478,_BURIALS._,"Like flowers we wither, and like leaves we fall;--"
8479,_BURIALS._,"Here, with an infant, joyful sponsors come,"
8480,_BURIALS._,Then bear the new-made Christian to its home;                      960
8481,_BURIALS._,"A few short years, and we behold him stand,"
8482,_BURIALS._,"To ask a blessing, with his bride in hand:"
8483,_BURIALS._,"A few, still seeming shorter, and we hear"
8484,_BURIALS._,His widow weeping at her husband's bier:--
8485,_BURIALS._,"Thus, as the months succeed, shall infants take"
8486,_BURIALS._,Their names; thus parents shall the child forsake;
8487,_BURIALS._,"Thus brides again and bridegrooms blithe shall kneel,"
8488,_BURIALS._,"By love or law compell'd their vows to seal,"
8489,_BURIALS._,"Ere I again, or one like me, explore"
8490,_BURIALS._,These simple annals of the VILLAGE POOR.                           970

9282,PATIENT.,"And, with resistless terror, drew."
9283,PATIENT.,"Through lands we fled, o'er seas we flew,"
9284,PATIENT.,And halted on a boundless plain;
9285,PATIENT.,"Where nothing fed, nor breathed, nor grew,"
9286,PATIENT.,But silence ruled the still domain.
9287,PATIENT.,
9288,PATIENT.,"Upon that boundless plain, below,"
9289,PATIENT.,"The setting sun's last rays were shed,"
9290,PATIENT.,"And gave a mild and sober glow,"
9291,PATIENT.,"Where all were still, asleep, or dead;"
9292,PATIENT.,"Vast ruins in the midst were spread,                               200"
9293,PATIENT.,"Pillars and pediments sublime,"
9294,PATIENT.,"Where the grey moss had form'd a bed,"
9295,PATIENT.,And clothed the crumbling spoils of time.
9296,PATIENT.,
9297,PATIENT.,"There was I fix'd, I know not how,"
9298,PATIENT.,Condemn'd for untold years to stay:
9299,PATIENT.,Yet years were not;--one dreadful _now_
9300,PATIENT.,Endured no change of night or day;
9301,PATIENT.,The same mild evening's sleeping ray
9302,PATIENT.,"Shone softly-solemn and serene,"
9303,PATIENT.,"And all that time I gazed away,                                    210"
9304,PATIENT.,The setting sun's sad rays were seen.
9305,PATIENT.,
9306,PATIENT.,At length a moment's sleep stole on--
9307,PATIENT.,Again came my commission'd foes;
9308,PATIENT.,"Again through sea and land we're gone,"
9309,PATIENT.,"No peace, no respite, no repose:"
9310,PATIENT.,"Above the dark broad sea we rose,"
9311,PATIENT.,We ran through bleak and frozen land;
9312,PATIENT.,"I had no strength their strength t' oppose,"
9313,PATIENT.,An infant in a giant's hand.
9314,PATIENT.,
9315,PATIENT.,"They placed me where those streamers play,                         220"
9316,PATIENT.,Those nimble beams of brilliant light;
9317,PATIENT.,"It would the stoutest heart dismay,"
9318,PATIENT.,"To see, to feel, that dreadful sight:"
9319,PATIENT.,"So swift, so pure, so cold, so bright,"
9320,PATIENT.,"They pierced my frame with icy wound,"
9321,PATIENT.,"And, all that half-year's polar night,"
9322,PATIENT.,Those dancing streamers wrapp'd me round.
9323,PATIENT.,
9324,PATIENT.,"Slowly that darkness pass'd away,"
9325,PATIENT.,When down upon the earth I fell;--
9326,PATIENT.,Some hurried sleep was mine by day;                                230
9327,PATIENT.,"But, soon as toll'd the evening bell,"
9328,PATIENT.,"They forced me on, where ever dwell"
9329,PATIENT.,"Far-distant men in cities fair,"
9330,PATIENT.,"Cities of whom no trav'lers tell,"
9331,PATIENT.,Nor feet but mine were wanderers there.
9332,PATIENT.,
9333,PATIENT.,"Their watchmen stare, and stand aghast,"
9334,PATIENT.,As on we hurry through the dark;
9335,PATIENT.,"The watch-light blinks as we go past,"
9336,PATIENT.,The watch-dog shrinks and fears to bark;
9337,PATIENT.,"The watch-tower's bell sounds shrill; and, hark!                   240"
9338,PATIENT.,The free wind blows--we've left the town--
9339,PATIENT.,"A wide sepulchral ground I mark,"
9340,PATIENT.,And on a tombstone place me down.
9341,PATIENT.,
9342,PATIENT.,What monuments of mighty dead!
9343,PATIENT.,What tombs of various kinds are found!
9344,PATIENT.,And stones erect their shadows shed
9345,PATIENT.,"On humble graves, with wickers bound;"
9346,PATIENT.,"Some risen fresh, above the ground,"
9347,PATIENT.,"Some level with the native clay,"
9348,PATIENT.,"What sleeping millions wait the sound,                             250"
9349,PATIENT.,"""Arise, ye dead, and come away!"""
9350,PATIENT.,
9351,PATIENT.,Alas! they stay not for that call;
9352,PATIENT.,"Spare me this wo! ye demons, spare!--"
9353,PATIENT.,They come! the shrouded shadows all--
9354,PATIENT.,'Tis more than mortal brain can bear;
9355,PATIENT.,"Rustling they rise, they sternly glare"
9356,PATIENT.,"At man, upheld by vital breath;"
9357,PATIENT.,"Who, led by wicked fiends, should dare"
9358,PATIENT.,To join the shadowy troops of death!
9359,PATIENT.,
9360,PATIENT.,"Yes, I have felt all man can feel,                                 260"
9361,PATIENT.,Till he shall pay his nature's debt:
9362,PATIENT.,"Ills that no hope has strength to heal,"
9363,PATIENT.,No mind the comfort to forget:
9364,PATIENT.,"Whatever cares the heart can fret,"
9365,PATIENT.,"The spirits wear, the temper gall,"
9366,PATIENT.,"Wo, want, dread, anguish, all beset"
9367,PATIENT.,My sinful soul!--together all!
9368,PATIENT.,
9369,PATIENT.,Those fiends upon a shaking fen
9370,PATIENT.,"Fix'd me, in dark tempestuous night;"
9371,PATIENT.,There never trod the foot of men;                                  270
9372,PATIENT.,There flock'd the fowl in wint'ry flight;
9373,PATIENT.,There danced the moor's deceitful light
9374,PATIENT.,Above the pool where sedges grow;
9375,PATIENT.,"And, when the morning-sun shone bright,"
9376,PATIENT.,It shone upon a field of snow.
9377,PATIENT.,
9378,PATIENT.,They hung me on a bough so small.
9379,PATIENT.,The rook could build her nest no higher;
9380,PATIENT.,They fix'd me on the trembling ball
9381,PATIENT.,That crowns the steeple's quiv'ring spire;
9382,PATIENT.,"They set me where the seas retire,                                 280"
9383,PATIENT.,But drown with their returning tide;
9384,PATIENT.,"And made me flee the mountain's fire,"
9385,PATIENT.,When rolling from its burning side.
9386,PATIENT.,
9387,PATIENT.,I've hung upon the ridgy steep
9388,PATIENT.,"Of cliffs, and held the rambling brier;"
9389,PATIENT.,"I've plunged below the billowy deep,"
9390,PATIENT.,Where air was sent me to respire;
9391,PATIENT.,I've been where hungry wolves retire;
9392,PATIENT.,And (to complete my woes) I've ran
9393,PATIENT.,Where Bedlam's crazy crew conspire                                 290
9394,PATIENT.,Against the life of reasoning man.
9395,PATIENT.,
9396,PATIENT.,"I've furl'd in storms the flapping sail,"
9397,PATIENT.,By hanging from the topmast-head;
9398,PATIENT.,"I've served the vilest slaves in jail,"
9399,PATIENT.,And pick'd the dunghill's spoil for bread;
9400,PATIENT.,"I've made the badger's hole my bed,"
9401,PATIENT.,I've wander'd with a gipsy crew;
9402,PATIENT.,"I've dreaded all the guilty dread,"
9403,PATIENT.,And done what they would fear to do.
9404,PATIENT.,
9405,PATIENT.,"On sand, where ebbs and flows the flood,                           300"
9406,PATIENT.,Midway they placed and bade me die;
9407,PATIENT.,"Propp'd on my staff, I stoutly stood,"
9408,PATIENT.,When the swift waves came rolling by;
9409,PATIENT.,"And high they rose, and still more high,"
9410,PATIENT.,Till my lips drank the bitter brine;
9411,PATIENT.,"I sobb'd convulsed, then cast mine eye,"
9412,PATIENT.,And saw the tide's re-flowing sign.
9413,PATIENT.,
9414,PATIENT.,"And then, my dreams were such as nought"
9415,PATIENT.,Could yield but my unhappy case;
9416,PATIENT.,"I've been of thousand devils caught,                               310"
9417,PATIENT.,"And thrust into that horrid place,"
9418,PATIENT.,"Where reign dismay, despair, disgrace;"
9419,PATIENT.,"Furies with iron fangs were there,"
9420,PATIENT.,"To torture that accursed race,"
9421,PATIENT.,"Doomed to dismay, disgrace, despair."
9422,PATIENT.,
9423,PATIENT.,"Harmless I was, yet hunted down"
9424,PATIENT.,"For treasons, to my soul unfit;"
9425,PATIENT.,"I've been pursued through many a town,"
9426,PATIENT.,For crimes that petty knaves commit;
9427,PATIENT.,"I've been adjudged t' have lost my wit,                            320"
9428,PATIENT.,Because I preach'd so loud and well;
9429,PATIENT.,"And thrown into the dungeon's pit,"
9430,PATIENT.,For trampling on the pit of hell.
9431,PATIENT.,
9432,PATIENT.,"Such were the evils, man of sin."
9433,PATIENT.,That I was fated to sustain;
9434,PATIENT.,"And add to all, without--within,"
9435,PATIENT.,A soul defiled with every stain
9436,PATIENT.,That man's reflecting mind can pain;
9437,PATIENT.,"That pride, wrong, rage, despair, can make;"
9438,PATIENT.,"In fact, they'd nearly touch'd my brain,                           330"
9439,PATIENT.,And reason on her throne would shake.
9440,PATIENT.,
9441,PATIENT.,"But pity will the vilest seek,"
9442,PATIENT.,If punish'd guilt will not repine;--
9443,PATIENT.,"I heard a heavenly teacher speak,"
9444,PATIENT.,And felt the SUN OF MERCY shine:
9445,PATIENT.,I hail'd the light! the birth divine!
9446,PATIENT.,And then was seal'd among the few;
9447,PATIENT.,"Those angry fiends beheld the sign,"
9448,PATIENT.,And from me in an instant flew.
9449,PATIENT.,
9450,PATIENT.,"Come, hear how thus the charmers cry                               340"
9451,PATIENT.,"To wandering sheep, the strays of sin,"
9452,PATIENT.,"While some the wicket-gate pass by,"
9453,PATIENT.,And some will knock and enter in:
9454,PATIENT.,"Full joyful 'tis a soul to win,"
9455,PATIENT.,For he that winneth souls is wise;
9456,PATIENT.,"Now, hark! the holy strains begin,"
9457,PATIENT.,And thus the sainted preacher cries[29]:--
9458,PATIENT.,
9459,PATIENT.,"""Pilgrim, burthen'd with thy sin,"
9460,PATIENT.,"Come the way to Zion's gate,"
9461,PATIENT.,"There, till Mercy let thee in,                                 350"
9462,PATIENT.,"Knock and weep, and watch and wait."
9463,PATIENT.,Knock!--He knows the sinner's cry;
9464,PATIENT.,Weep!--He loves the mourner's tears;
9465,PATIENT.,Watch!--for saving grace is nigh;
9466,PATIENT.,Wait!--till heavenly light appears.
9467,PATIENT.,
9468,PATIENT.,"""Hark! it is the Bridegroom's voice;"
9469,PATIENT.,"Welcome, pilgrim, to thy rest;"
9470,PATIENT.,"Now within the gate rejoice,"
9471,PATIENT.,"Safe and seal'd, and bought and bless'd!"
9472,PATIENT.,Safe--from all the lures of vice;                            360
9473,PATIENT.,Seal'd--by signs the chosen know;
9474,PATIENT.,Bought--by love and life the price;
9475,PATIENT.,Bless'd--the mighty debt to owe.
9476,PATIENT.,
9477,PATIENT.,"""Holy Pilgrim! what for thee"
9478,PATIENT.,In a world like this remain?
9479,PATIENT.,From thy guarded breast shall flee
9480,PATIENT.,"Fear and shame, and doubt and pain."
9481,PATIENT.,Fear--the hope of Heaven shall fly;
9482,PATIENT.,Shame--from glory's view retire;
9483,PATIENT.,Doubt--in certain rapture die;                               370
9484,PATIENT.,"Pain--in endless bliss expire."""
9485,PATIENT.,
9486,PATIENT.,"But though my day of grace was come,"
9487,PATIENT.,Yet still my days of grief I find;
9488,PATIENT.,The former clouds' collected gloom
9489,PATIENT.,Still sadden the reflecting mind;
9490,PATIENT.,"The soul, to evil things consign'd."
9491,PATIENT.,Will of their evil some retain;
9492,PATIENT.,"The man will seem to earth inclined,"
9493,PATIENT.,And will not look erect again.
9494,PATIENT.,
9495,PATIENT.,"Thus, though elect, I feel it hard                                 380"
9496,PATIENT.,"To lose what I possess'd before,"
9497,PATIENT.,To be from all my wealth debarr'd:--
9498,PATIENT.,The brave Sir Eustace is no more.
9499,PATIENT.,"But old I wax and passing poor,"
9500,PATIENT.,"Stern, rugged men my conduct view;"
9501,PATIENT.,"They chide my wish, they bar my door,"
9502,PATIENT.,'Tis hard--I weep--you see I do.--
9503,PATIENT.,
9504,PATIENT.,"Must you, my friends, no longer stay?"
9505,PATIENT.,Thus quickly all my pleasures end;
9506,PATIENT.,"But I'll remember, when I pray,                                    390"
9507,PATIENT.,My kind physician and his friend;
9508,PATIENT.,And those sad hours you deign to spend
9509,PATIENT.,"With me, I shall requite them all;"
9510,PATIENT.,"Sir Eustace for his friends shall send,"
9511,PATIENT.,And thank their love at Greyling Hall.
9512,PATIENT.,
9513,VISITOR.,VISITOR.
9514,VISITOR.,
9515,VISITOR.,The poor Sir Eustace!--Yet his hope
9516,VISITOR.,Leads him to think of joys again;
9517,VISITOR.,"And when his earthly visions droop,"
9518,VISITOR.,His views of heavenly kind remain.--
9519,VISITOR.,"But whence that meek and humbled strain,                           400"
9520,VISITOR.,"That spirit wounded, lost, resign'd?"
9521,VISITOR.,Would not so proud a soul disdain
9522,VISITOR.,The madness of the poorest mind?
9523,VISITOR.,
9524,PHYSICIAN.,PHYSICIAN.
9525,PHYSICIAN.,
9526,PHYSICIAN.,"No! for the more he swell'd with pride,"
9527,PHYSICIAN.,The more he felt misfortune's blow;
9528,PHYSICIAN.,"Disgrace and grief he could not hide,"
9529,PHYSICIAN.,And poverty had laid him low:
9530,PHYSICIAN.,"Thus shame and sorrow working slow,"
9531,PHYSICIAN.,At length this humble spirit gave;
9532,PHYSICIAN.,"Madness on these began to grow,                                    410"
9533,PHYSICIAN.,And bound him to his fiends a slave.
9534,PHYSICIAN.,
9535,PHYSICIAN.,"Though the wild thoughts had touch'd his brain,"
9536,PHYSICIAN.,"Then was he free.--So, forth he ran;"
9537,PHYSICIAN.,"To soothe or threat, alike were vain:"
9538,PHYSICIAN.,He spake of fiends; look'd wild and wan;
9539,PHYSICIAN.,"Year after year, the hurried man"
9540,PHYSICIAN.,Obey'd those fiends from place to place;
9541,PHYSICIAN.,Till his religious change began
9542,PHYSICIAN.,To form a frenzied child of grace.
9543,PHYSICIAN.,
9544,PHYSICIAN.,"For, as the fury lost its strength,                                420"
9545,PHYSICIAN.,The mind reposed; by slow degrees
9546,PHYSICIAN.,"Came lingering hope, and brought at length,"
9547,PHYSICIAN.,To the tormented spirit ease:
9548,PHYSICIAN.,"This slave of sin, whom fiends could seize,"
9549,PHYSICIAN.,Felt or believed their power had end;--
9550,PHYSICIAN.,"""'Tis faith,"" he cried, ""my bosom frees,"
9551,PHYSICIAN.,"And now my SAVIOUR is my friend."""
9552,PHYSICIAN.,
9553,PHYSICIAN.,"But ah! though time can yield relief,"
9554,PHYSICIAN.,"And soften woes it cannot cure,"
9555,PHYSICIAN.,"Would we not suffer pain and grief,                                430"
9556,PHYSICIAN.,To have our reason sound and sure?
9557,PHYSICIAN.,"Then let us keep our bosoms pure,"
9558,PHYSICIAN.,Our fancy's favourite flights suppress;
9559,PHYSICIAN.,"Prepare the body to endure,"
9560,PHYSICIAN.,And bend the mind to meet distress;
9561,PHYSICIAN.,"And then HIS guardian care implore,"
9562,PHYSICIAN.,Whom demons dread and men adore.

9663,VAGRANT.,Their sorrows and their sins I knew;                              40
9664,VAGRANT.,"With them, by want on error forced,"
9665,VAGRANT.,"Like them, I base and guilty grew."
9666,VAGRANT.,
9667,VAGRANT.,"Few are my years, not so my crimes;"
9668,VAGRANT.,"The age, which these sad looks declare,"
9669,VAGRANT.,"Is Sorrow's work, it is not Time's,"
9670,VAGRANT.,And I am old in shame and care.
9671,VAGRANT.,
9672,VAGRANT.,Taught to believe the world a place
9673,VAGRANT.,"Where every stranger was a foe,"
9674,VAGRANT.,"Train'd in the arts that mark our race,"
9675,VAGRANT.,To what new people could I go?                                    50
9676,VAGRANT.,"Could I a better life embrace,"
9677,VAGRANT.,Or live as virtue dictates? No!--
9678,VAGRANT.,
9679,VAGRANT.,"So through the land I wandering went,"
9680,VAGRANT.,And little found of grief or joy;
9681,VAGRANT.,But lost my bosom's sweet content
9682,VAGRANT.,When first I loved--the Gipsy-Boy.
9683,VAGRANT.,
9684,VAGRANT.,"A sturdy youth he was and tall,"
9685,VAGRANT.,His looks would all his soul declare;
9686,VAGRANT.,"His piercing eyes were deep and small,"
9687,VAGRANT.,And strongly curl'd his raven-hair.                               60
9688,VAGRANT.,
9689,VAGRANT.,"Yes, Aaron had each manly charm,"
9690,VAGRANT.,All in the May of youthful pride;
9691,VAGRANT.,"He scarcely fear'd his father's arm,"
9692,VAGRANT.,And every other arm defied.--
9693,VAGRANT.,"Oft, when they grew in anger warm,"
9694,VAGRANT.,(Whom will not love and power divide?)
9695,VAGRANT.,"I rose, their wrathful souls to calm,"
9696,VAGRANT.,Not yet in sinful combat tried.
9697,VAGRANT.,
9698,VAGRANT.,"His father was our party's chief,"
9699,VAGRANT.,And dark and dreadful was his look;                               70
9700,VAGRANT.,His presence fill'd my heart with grief;
9701,VAGRANT.,Although to me he kindly spoke.
9702,VAGRANT.,
9703,VAGRANT.,"With Aaron I delighted went,"
9704,VAGRANT.,His favour was my bliss and pride;
9705,VAGRANT.,"In growing hope our days we spent,"
9706,VAGRANT.,Love growing charms in either spied;
9707,VAGRANT.,"It saw them, all which Nature lent,"
9708,VAGRANT.,It lent them all which she denied.
9709,VAGRANT.,
9710,VAGRANT.,"Could I the father's kindness prize,"
9711,VAGRANT.,"Or grateful looks on him bestow,                                  80"
9712,VAGRANT.,"Whom I beheld in wrath arise,"
9713,VAGRANT.,When Aaron sunk beneath his blow?
9714,VAGRANT.,
9715,VAGRANT.,"He drove him down with wicked hand,--"
9716,VAGRANT.,It was a dreadful sight to see;
9717,VAGRANT.,"Then vex'd him, till he left the land,"
9718,VAGRANT.,And told his cruel love to me;--
9719,VAGRANT.,"The clan were all at his command,"
9720,VAGRANT.,Whatever his command might be.
9721,VAGRANT.,
9722,VAGRANT.,"The night was dark, the lanes were deep,"
9723,VAGRANT.,And one by one they took their way;                               90
9724,VAGRANT.,"He bade me lay me down and sleep,"
9725,VAGRANT.,I only wept and wish'd for day.
9726,VAGRANT.,
9727,VAGRANT.,Accursèd be the love he bore.
9728,VAGRANT.,Accursèd was the force he used;
9729,VAGRANT.,So let him of his God implore
9730,VAGRANT.,"For mercy, and be so refused!"
9731,VAGRANT.,
9732,VAGRANT.,"You frown again;--to show my wrong,"
9733,VAGRANT.,Can I in gentle language speak?
9734,VAGRANT.,"My woes are deep, my words are strong;--"
9735,VAGRANT.,"And hear me, or my heart will break.                             100"

9781,VAGRANT.,
9782,VAGRANT.,But I had mightier cause for fear;
9783,VAGRANT.,For slow and mournful round my bed
9784,VAGRANT.,I saw a dreadful form appear--
9785,VAGRANT.,It came when I and Aaron wed.                                     20

9792,VAGRANT.,For he not yet had felt the pain
9793,VAGRANT.,That rankles in a wounded breast;
9794,VAGRANT.,"He waked to sin, then slept again,"
9795,VAGRANT.,"Forsook his God, yet took his rest.--"

9799,VAGRANT.,"And mem'ry now recalls the night,"
9800,VAGRANT.,"With such surprise and horror fraught,"
9801,VAGRANT.,"That reason felt a moment's flight,"
9802,VAGRANT.,And left a mind to madness wrought.)
9803,VAGRANT.,
9804,VAGRANT.,"When waking, on my heaving breast"
9805,VAGRANT.,I felt a hand as cold as death;
9806,VAGRANT.,"A sudden fear my voice suppress'd,"
9807,VAGRANT.,A chilling terror stopp'd my breath.--
9808,VAGRANT.,
9809,VAGRANT.,I seem'd--no words can utter how!
9810,VAGRANT.,For there my father-husband stood--                               40
9811,VAGRANT.,"And thus he said:--""Will God allow,"
9812,VAGRANT.,"""The great avenger, just and good,"
9813,VAGRANT.,"A wife to break her marriage vow,"
9814,VAGRANT.,"A son to shed his father's blood?"""
9815,VAGRANT.,
9816,VAGRANT.,"I trembled at the dismal sounds,"
9817,VAGRANT.,But vainly strove a word to say;
9818,VAGRANT.,"So, pointing to his bleeding wounds,"
9819,VAGRANT.,The threat'ning spectre stalk'd away[30].
9820,VAGRANT.,
9821,VAGRANT.,"I brought a lovely daughter forth,"
9822,VAGRANT.,"His father's child, in Aaron's bed;                               50"
9823,VAGRANT.,He took her from me in his wrath;--
9824,VAGRANT.,"""Where is my child?""--""Thy child is dead."""
9825,VAGRANT.,
9826,VAGRANT.,"'Twas false--we wander'd far and wide,"
9827,VAGRANT.,"Through town and country, field and fen,"
9828,VAGRANT.,"Till Aaron, fighting, fell and died,"
9829,VAGRANT.,And I became a wife again.
9830,VAGRANT.,
9831,VAGRANT.,I then was young:--my husband sold
9832,VAGRANT.,My fancied charms for wicked price;
9833,VAGRANT.,"He gave me oft, for sinful gold,"
9834,VAGRANT.,"The slave, but not the friend, of vice--                          60"
9835,VAGRANT.,"Behold me, Heaven! my pains behold,"
9836,VAGRANT.,And let them for my sins suffice!
9837,VAGRANT.,
9838,VAGRANT.,"The wretch, who lent me thus for gain,"
9839,VAGRANT.,Despised me when my youth was fled;
9840,VAGRANT.,"Then came disease, and brought me pain--"
9841,VAGRANT.,"Come, death, and bear me to the dead!"
9842,VAGRANT.,"For, though I grieve, my grief is vain,"
9843,VAGRANT.,And fruitless all the tears I shed.
9844,VAGRANT.,
9845,VAGRANT.,"True, I was not to virtue train'd;"
9846,VAGRANT.,Yet well I knew my deeds were ill;                                70
9847,VAGRANT.,By each offence my heart was pain'd--
9848,VAGRANT.,"I wept, but I offended still;"
9849,VAGRANT.,"My better thoughts my life disdain'd,"
9850,VAGRANT.,But yet the viler led my will.
9851,VAGRANT.,
9852,VAGRANT.,"My husband died, and now no more"
9853,VAGRANT.,"My smile was sought, or ask'd my hand--"
9854,VAGRANT.,"A widow'd vagrant, vile and poor,"
9855,VAGRANT.,Beneath a vagrant's vile command.
9856,VAGRANT.,
9857,VAGRANT.,"Ceaseless I roved the country round,"
9858,VAGRANT.,"To win my bread by fraudful arts,                                 80"
9859,VAGRANT.,"And long a poor subsistence found,"
9860,VAGRANT.,By spreading nets for simple hearts.
9861,VAGRANT.,
9862,VAGRANT.,"Though poor, and abject, and despised,"
9863,VAGRANT.,Their fortunes to the crowd I told;
9864,VAGRANT.,"I gave the young the love they prized,"
9865,VAGRANT.,And promised wealth to bless the old;
9866,VAGRANT.,"Schemes for the doubtful I devised,"
9867,VAGRANT.,And charms for the forsaken sold.
9868,VAGRANT.,
9869,VAGRANT.,At length for arts like these confined
9870,VAGRANT.,"In prison with a lawless crew,                                    90"
9871,VAGRANT.,"I soon perceived a kindred mind,"
9872,VAGRANT.,And there my long-lost daughter knew:
9873,VAGRANT.,
9874,VAGRANT.,"His father's child, whom Aaron gave"
9875,VAGRANT.,"To wander with a distant clan,"
9876,VAGRANT.,"The miseries of the world to brave,"
9877,VAGRANT.,And be the slave of vice and man.
9878,VAGRANT.,
9879,VAGRANT.,She knew my name--we met in pain;
9880,VAGRANT.,Our parting pangs can I express?
9881,VAGRANT.,"She sail'd a convict o'er the main,"
9882,VAGRANT.,And left an heir to her distress.                                100
9883,VAGRANT.,
9884,VAGRANT.,"This is that heir to shame and pain,"
9885,VAGRANT.,For whom I only could descry
9886,VAGRANT.,A world of trouble and disdain--
9887,VAGRANT.,"Yet, could I bear to see her die,"
9888,VAGRANT.,"Or stretch her feeble hand in vain,"
9889,VAGRANT.,"And, weeping, beg of me supply?"
9890,VAGRANT.,
9891,VAGRANT.,No! though the fate thy mother knew
9892,VAGRANT.,Was shameful! shameful though thy race
9893,VAGRANT.,"Have wander'd all, a lawless crew,"
9894,VAGRANT.,"Outcasts, despised in every place:                               110"
9895,VAGRANT.,
9896,VAGRANT.,"Yet, as the dark and muddy tide,"
9897,VAGRANT.,"When far from its polluted source,"
9898,VAGRANT.,"Becomes more pure, and, purified,"
9899,VAGRANT.,Flows in a clear and happy course--
9900,VAGRANT.,
9901,VAGRANT.,"In thee, dear infant! so may end"
9902,VAGRANT.,"Our shame, in thee our sorrows cease!"
9903,VAGRANT.,"And thy pure course will then extend,"
9904,VAGRANT.,"In floods of joy, o'er vales of peace."
9905,VAGRANT.,"Oh! by the God who loves to spare,"
9906,VAGRANT.,Deny me not the boon I crave;                                    120
9907,VAGRANT.,"Let this loved child your mercy share,"
9908,VAGRANT.,And let me find a peaceful grave;
9909,VAGRANT.,"Make her yet spotless soul your care,"
9910,VAGRANT.,And let my sins their portion have;

10051,"MY LORD,",
10052,"MY LORD,","The poem, for which I have ventured to solicit your Grace's attention,"
10053,"MY LORD,","was composed in a situation so near to Belvoir Castle, that the author"
10054,"MY LORD,",had all the advantage to be derived from prospects extensive and
10055,"MY LORD,","beautiful, and from works of grandeur and sublimity: and, though"
10056,"MY LORD,",nothing of the influence arising from such situation should be
10057,"MY LORD,","discernible in these verses, either from want of adequate powers in"
10058,"MY LORD,","the writer, or because his subjects do not assimilate with such views,"
10059,"MY LORD,","yet would it be natural for him to indulge a wish, that he might"
10060,"MY LORD,",inscribe his labours to the lord of a scene which perpetually excited
10061,"MY LORD,","his admiration, and he would plead the propriety of placing the titles"
10062,"MY LORD,",of the House of Rutland at the entrance of a volume written in the
10063,"MY LORD,",Vale of Belvoir.
10064,"MY LORD,",
10065,"MY LORD,","But, my Lord, a motive much more powerful than a sense of propriety, a"
10066,"MY LORD,",grateful remembrance of benefits conferred by the noble family in
10067,"MY LORD,","which you preside, has been the great inducement for me to wish that I"
10068,"MY LORD,",might be permitted to inscribe this work to your Grace. The honours of
10069,"MY LORD,","that time were to me unexpected, they were unmerited, and they were"
10070,"MY LORD,","transitory; but since I am thus allowed to make public my gratitude, I"
10071,"MY LORD,",am in some degree restored to the honour of that period; I have again
10072,"MY LORD,","the happiness to find myself favoured, and my exertions stimulated, by"
10073,"MY LORD,",the condescension of the Duke of Rutland.
10074,"MY LORD,",
10075,"MY LORD,","It was my fortune, in a poem which yet circulates, to write of the"
10076,"MY LORD,","virtues, talents, and heroic death of Lord Robert Manners, and to bear"
10077,"MY LORD,","witness to the affection of a brother whose grief was poignant, and to"
10078,"MY LORD,",be soothed only by remembrance of his worth whom he so deeply
10079,"MY LORD,","deplored. In a patron thus favourably predisposed, my Lord, I might"
10080,"MY LORD,","look for much lenity, and could not fear the severity of critical"
10081,"MY LORD,","examination: from your Grace, who, happily, have no such impediment to"
10082,"MY LORD,","justice, I must not look for the same kind of indulgence. I am"
10083,"MY LORD,","assured, by those whose situation gave them opportunity for knowledge,"
10084,"MY LORD,","and whose abilities and attention guarded them from error, that I must"
10085,"MY LORD,","not expect my failings will escape detection from want of discernment,"
10086,"MY LORD,",neither am I to fear that any merit will be undistinguished through
10087,"MY LORD,","deficiency of taste. It is from this information, my Lord, and a"
10088,"MY LORD,","consciousness of much which needs forgiveness, that I entreat your"
10089,"MY LORD,","Grace to read my verses, with a wish, I had almost added, with a"
10090,"MY LORD,","purpose, to be pleased, and to make every possible allowance for"
10091,"MY LORD,","subjects not always pleasing, for manners sometimes gross, and for"
10092,"MY LORD,",language too frequently incorrect.
10093,"MY LORD,",
10094,"MY LORD,","With the fullest confidence in your Grace's ability and favour, in the"
10095,"MY LORD,","accuracy of your judgment, and the lenity of your decision; with"
10096,"MY LORD,","grateful remembrance of benefits received, and due consciousness of"
10097,"MY LORD,",the little I could merit; with prayers that your Grace may long enjoy
10098,"MY LORD,","the dignities of the House of Rutland, and continue to dictate"
10099,"MY LORD,","improvement for the surrounding country--I terminate an address, in"

10116,PREFACE.,
10117,PREFACE.,"Whether, if I had not been encouraged by some proofs of public favour,"
10118,PREFACE.,"I should have written the Poem now before the reader, is a question"
10119,PREFACE.,"which I cannot positively determine; but I will venture to assert,"
10120,PREFACE.,"that I should not, in that case, have committed the work to the press;"
10121,PREFACE.,I should not have allowed my own opinion of it to have led me into
10122,PREFACE.,"further disappointment, against the voice of judges impartial and"
10123,PREFACE.,"indifferent, from whose sentence it had been fruitless to appeal. The"
10124,PREFACE.,"success of a late publication, therefore, may be fairly assigned as"
10125,PREFACE.,the principal cause for the appearance of this.
10126,PREFACE.,
10127,PREFACE.,"When the ensuing Letters were so far written, that I could form an"
10128,PREFACE.,"opinion of them, and when I began to conceive that they might not be"
10129,PREFACE.,"unacceptable to the public, I felt myself prompted by duty, as well as"
10130,PREFACE.,"interest, to put them to the press; I considered myself bound by"
10131,PREFACE.,"gratitude for the favourable treatment I had already received, to show"
10132,PREFACE.,"that I was not unmindful of it; and, however this might be mixed with"
10133,PREFACE.,"other motives, it operated with considerable force upon my mind,"
10134,PREFACE.,"acting as a stimulus to exertions naturally tardy, and to expectations"
10135,PREFACE.,easily checked.
10136,PREFACE.,
10137,PREFACE.,"It must nevertheless be acknowledged that, although such favourable"
10138,PREFACE.,"opinion had been formed, I was not able, with the requisite"
10139,PREFACE.,"impartiality, to determine the comparative value of an unpublished"
10140,PREFACE.,"manuscript, and a work sent into the world. Books, like children, when"
10141,PREFACE.,"established, have doubtless our parental affection and good wishes; we"
10142,PREFACE.,"rejoice to hear that they are doing well, and are received and"
10143,PREFACE.,"respected in good company: but it is to manuscripts in the study, as"
10144,PREFACE.,"to children in the nursery, that our care, our anxiety, and our"
10145,PREFACE.,tenderness are principally directed: they are fondled as our endearing
10146,PREFACE.,"companions, their faults are corrected with the lenity of partial"
10147,PREFACE.,"love, and their good parts are exaggerated by the strength of parental"
10148,PREFACE.,imagination; nor is it easy even for the more cool and reasonable
10149,PREFACE.,"among parents, thus circumstanced, to decide upon the comparative"
10150,PREFACE.,"merits of their offspring, whether they be children of the bed or"
10151,PREFACE.,issue of the brain.
10152,PREFACE.,
10153,PREFACE.,"But, however favourable my own opinion may have been, or may still be,"
10154,PREFACE.,I could not venture to commit so long a Poem to the press without some
10155,PREFACE.,endeavour to obtain the more valuable opinion of less partial judges.
10156,PREFACE.,"At the same time, I am willing to confess that I have lost some"
10157,PREFACE.,"portion of the timidity once so painful, and that I am encouraged to"
10158,PREFACE.,"take upon myself the decision of various points, which heretofore I"
10159,PREFACE.,"entreated my friends to decide. Those friends were then my council,"
10160,PREFACE.,"whose opinion I was implicitly to follow; they are now advisers, whose"
10161,PREFACE.,"ideas I am at liberty to reject. This will not, I hope, seem like"
10162,PREFACE.,"arrogance: it would be more safe, it would be more pleasant, still to"
10163,PREFACE.,have that reliance on the judgment of others; but it cannot always be
10164,PREFACE.,"obtained; nor are they, however friendly disposed, ever ready to lend"
10165,PREFACE.,a helping hand to him whom they consider as one who ought by this time
10166,PREFACE.,"to have cast away the timidity of inexperience, and to have acquired"
10167,PREFACE.,the courage that would enable him to decide for himself.
10168,PREFACE.,
10169,PREFACE.,"When it is confessed that I have less assistance from my friends, and"
10170,PREFACE.,"that the appearance of this work is, in a great measure, occasioned by"
10171,PREFACE.,"the success of a former, some readers will, I fear, entertain the"
10172,PREFACE.,"opinion that the book before them was written in haste, and published"
10173,PREFACE.,"without due examination and revisal. Should this opinion be formed,"
10174,PREFACE.,there will doubtless occur many faults which may appear as originating
10175,PREFACE.,"in neglect. Now, readers are, I believe, disposed to treat with more"
10176,PREFACE.,than common severity those writers who have been led into presumption
10177,PREFACE.,"by the approbation bestowed on their diffidence, and into idleness and"
10178,PREFACE.,"unconcern, by the praises given to their attention. I am therefore"
10179,PREFACE.,even anxious it should be generally known that sufficient time and
10180,PREFACE.,"application were bestowed upon this work, and by this I mean that no"
10181,PREFACE.,material alteration would be effected by delay; it is true that this
10182,PREFACE.,"confession removes one plea for the errors of the book--want of time,"
10183,PREFACE.,"but, in my opinion, there is not much consolation to be drawn by"
10184,PREFACE.,"reasonable minds from this resource: if a work fails, it appears to be"
10185,PREFACE.,"poor satisfaction when it is observed, that if the author had taken"
10186,PREFACE.,"more care, the event had been less disgraceful."
10187,PREFACE.,
10188,PREFACE.,"When the reader enters into the Poem, he will find the author retired"
10189,PREFACE.,"from view, and an imaginary personage brought forward to describe his"
10190,PREFACE.,Borough for him. To him it seemed convenient to speak in the first
10191,PREFACE.,"person; but the inhabitant of a village, in the centre of the kingdom,"
10192,PREFACE.,could not appear in the character of a residing burgess in a large
10193,PREFACE.,"sea-port; and when, with this point, was considered what relations"
10194,PREFACE.,"were to be given, what manners delineated, and what situations"
10195,PREFACE.,"described, no method appeared to be so convenient as that of borrowing"
10196,PREFACE.,the assistance of an ideal friend. By this means the reader is in some
10197,PREFACE.,degree kept from view of any particular place; nor will he perhaps be
10198,PREFACE.,"so likely to determine where those persons reside, and what their"
10199,PREFACE.,"connexions, who are so intimately known to this man of straw."
10200,PREFACE.,
10201,PREFACE.,"From the title of this Poem, some persons will, I fear, expect a"
10202,PREFACE.,"political satire,--an attack upon corrupt principles in a general"
10203,PREFACE.,"view, or upon the customs and manners of some particular place; of"
10204,PREFACE.,"these they will find nothing satirized, nothing related. It may be"
10205,PREFACE.,that graver readers would have preferred a more historical account of
10206,PREFACE.,"so considerable a Borough--its charter, privileges, trade, public"
10207,PREFACE.,"structures, and subjects of this kind; but I have an apology for the"
10208,PREFACE.,"omission of these things, in the difficulty of describing them, and in"
10209,PREFACE.,the utter repugnancy which subsists between the studies and objects of
10210,PREFACE.,"topography and poetry. What I thought I could best describe, that I"
10211,PREFACE.,"attempted:--the sea, and the country in the immediate vicinity; the"
10212,PREFACE.,"dwellings, and the inhabitants; some incidents and characters, with an"
10213,PREFACE.,"exhibition of morals and manners, offensive perhaps to those of"
10214,PREFACE.,"extremely delicate feelings, but sometimes, I hope, neither unamiable"
10215,PREFACE.,"nor unaffecting. An Election indeed forms a part of one Letter, but"
10216,PREFACE.,"the evil there described is one not greatly nor generally deplored,"
10217,PREFACE.,and there are probably many places of this kind where it is not felt.
10218,PREFACE.,
10219,PREFACE.,"From the variety of relations, characters, and descriptions which a"
10220,PREFACE.,"BOROUGH affords, several were rejected which a reader might reasonably"
10221,PREFACE.,expect to have met with: in this case he is entreated to believe that
10222,PREFACE.,"these, if they occurred to the author, were considered by him as"
10223,PREFACE.,"beyond his ability, as subjects which he could not treat in a manner"
10224,PREFACE.,satisfactory to himself. Possibly the admission of some will be
10225,PREFACE.,thought to require more apology than the rejection of others. In such
10226,PREFACE.,"variety, it is to be apprehended, that almost every reader will find"
10227,PREFACE.,"something not according with his ideas of propriety, or something"
10228,PREFACE.,repulsive to the tone of his feelings; nor could this be avoided but
10229,PREFACE.,"by the sacrifice of every event, opinion, and even expression, which"
10230,PREFACE.,could be thought liable to produce such effect; and this casting away
10231,PREFACE.,"so largely of our cargo, through fears of danger, though it might help"
10232,PREFACE.,"us to clear it, would render our vessel of little worth when she came"
10233,PREFACE.,"into port. I may likewise entertain a hope, that this very variety,"
10234,PREFACE.,"which gives scope to objection and censure, will also afford a better"
10235,PREFACE.,chance for approval and satisfaction.
10236,PREFACE.,
10237,PREFACE.,Of these objectionable parts many must be to me unknown; of others
10238,PREFACE.,"some opinion may be formed, and for their admission some plea may be"
10239,PREFACE.,stated.
10240,PREFACE.,
10241,PREFACE.,"In the first Letter is nothing which particularly calls for remark,"
10242,PREFACE.,except possibly the last line--giving a promise to the reader that he
10243,PREFACE.,should both smile and sigh in the perusal of the following Letters.
10244,PREFACE.,"This may appear vain, and more than an author ought to promise; but"
10245,PREFACE.,"let it be considered that the character assumed is that of a friend,"
10246,PREFACE.,"who gives an account of objects, persons, and events to his"
10247,PREFACE.,"correspondent, and who was therefore at liberty, without any"
10248,PREFACE.,"imputation of this kind, to suppose in what manner he would be"
10249,PREFACE.,affected by such descriptions.
10250,PREFACE.,
10251,PREFACE.,"Nothing, I trust, in the second Letter, which relates to the imitation"
10252,PREFACE.,"of what are called weather-stains on buildings, will seem to any"
10253,PREFACE.,invidious or offensive. I wished to make a comparison between those
10254,PREFACE.,"minute and curious bodies which cover the surface of some edifices,"
10255,PREFACE.,"and those kinds of stain which are formed of boles and ochres, and"
10256,PREFACE.,"laid on with a brush. Now, as the work of time cannot be anticipated"
10257,PREFACE.,"in such cases, it may be very judicious to have recourse to such"
10258,PREFACE.,expedients as will give to a recent structure the venerable appearance
10259,PREFACE.,"of antiquity; and in this case, though I might still observe the vast"
10260,PREFACE.,"difference between the living varieties of nature, and the distant"
10261,PREFACE.,"imitation of the artist, yet I would not forbear to make use of his"
10262,PREFACE.,"dexterity, because he could not clothe my freestone with _mucor_,"
10263,PREFACE.,"_lichen_, and _byssus_."
10264,PREFACE.,
10265,PREFACE.,The wants and mortifications of a poor Clergyman are the subjects of
10266,PREFACE.,"one portion of the third Letter; and, he being represented as a"
10267,PREFACE.,"stranger in the Borough, it may be necessary to make some apology for"
10268,PREFACE.,his appearance in the Poem. Previous to a late meeting of a literary
10269,PREFACE.,"society, whose benevolent purpose is well known to the public, I was"
10270,PREFACE.,"induced by a friend to compose a few verses, in which, with the"
10271,PREFACE.,"general commendation of the design, should be introduced a hint that"
10272,PREFACE.,the bounty might be farther extended; these verses a gentleman did me
10273,PREFACE.,"the honour to recite at the meeting, and they were printed as an"
10274,PREFACE.,"extract from the Poem, to which in fact they may be called an"
10275,PREFACE.,appendage.
10276,PREFACE.,
10277,PREFACE.,"I am now arrived at that part of my work, which I may expect will"
10278,PREFACE.,bring upon me some animadversion. Religion is a subject deeply
10279,PREFACE.,"interesting to the minds of many; and, when these minds are weak, they"
10280,PREFACE.,are often led by a warmth of feeling into the violence of causeless
10281,PREFACE.,resentment. I am therefore anxious that my purpose should be
10282,PREFACE.,understood; and I wish to point out what things they are which an
10283,PREFACE.,author may hold up to ridicule and be blameless. In referring to the
10284,PREFACE.,"two principal divisions of enthusiastical teachers, I have denominated"
10285,PREFACE.,"them, as I conceive they are generally called, _Calvinistic_ and"
10286,PREFACE.,"_Arminian_ Methodists. The _Arminians_, though divided and perhaps"
10287,PREFACE.,"subdivided, are still, when particular accuracy is not intended,"
10288,PREFACE.,"considered as one body, having had, for many years, one head, who is"
10289,PREFACE.,yet held in high respect by the varying members of the present day.
10290,PREFACE.,But the Calvinistic societies are to be looked upon rather as separate
10291,PREFACE.,"and independent congregations; and it is to one of these (unconnected,"
10292,PREFACE.,"as is supposed, with any other) I more particularly allude. But while"
10293,PREFACE.,"I am making use of this division, I must entreat that I may not be"
10294,PREFACE.,considered as one who takes upon him to censure the religious opinions
10295,PREFACE.,of any society or individual: the reader will find that the spirit of
10296,PREFACE.,"the enthusiast, and not his opinions, his manners, and not his creed,"
10297,PREFACE.,have engaged my attention. I have nothing to observe of the Calvinist
10298,PREFACE.,"and Arminian, considered as such; but my remarks are pointed at the"
10299,PREFACE.,"enthusiast and the bigot, at their folly and their craft."
10300,PREFACE.,
10301,PREFACE.,"To those readers who have seen the journals of the first Methodists,"
10302,PREFACE.,or the extracts quoted from them by their opposers[31] in the early
10303,PREFACE.,"times of this spiritual influenza, are sufficiently known all their"
10304,PREFACE.,leading notions and peculiarities; so that I have no need to enter
10305,PREFACE.,into such unpleasant inquiries in this place. I have only to observe
10306,PREFACE.,"that their tenets remain the same, and have still the former effect on"
10307,PREFACE.,the minds of the converted. There is yet that imagined contention with
10308,PREFACE.,"the powers of darkness, that is at once so lamentable and so"
10309,PREFACE.,"ludicrous; there is the same offensive familiarity with the Deity,"
10310,PREFACE.,with a full trust and confidence both in the immediate efficacy of
10311,PREFACE.,"their miserably delivered supplications, and in the reality of"
10312,PREFACE.,numberless small miracles wrought at their request and for their
10313,PREFACE.,"convenience; there still exists that delusion, by which some of the"
10314,PREFACE.,most common diseases of the body are regarded as proofs of the
10315,PREFACE.,malignity of Satan contending for dominion over the soul; and there
10316,PREFACE.,"still remains the same wretched jargon, composed of scriptural"
10317,PREFACE.,"language, debased by vulgar expressions, which has a kind of mystic"
10318,PREFACE.,influence on the minds of the ignorant. It will be recollected that it
10319,PREFACE.,is the abuse of those scriptural terms which I conceive to be
10320,PREFACE.,improper: they are doubtless most significant and efficacious when
10321,PREFACE.,used with propriety; but it is painful to the mind of a soberly devout
10322,PREFACE.,"person, when he hears every rise and fall of the animal spirits, every"
10323,PREFACE.,"whim and notion of enthusiastic ignorance, expressed in the venerable"
10324,PREFACE.,language of the Apostles and Evangelists.
10325,PREFACE.,
10326,PREFACE.,"The success of these people is great, but not surprising: as the"
10327,PREFACE.,"powers they claim are given, and come not of education, many may, and"
10328,PREFACE.,"therefore do, fancy they are endowed with them; so that they who do"
10329,PREFACE.,"not venture to become preachers, yet exert the minor gifts, and gain"
10330,PREFACE.,"reputation for the faculty of prayer, as soon as they can address the"
10331,PREFACE.,Creator in daring flights of unpremeditated absurdity. The less
10332,PREFACE.,"indigent gain the praise of hospitality, and the more harmonious"
10333,PREFACE.,become distinguished in their choirs; curiosity is kept alive by
10334,PREFACE.,"succession of ministers, and self-love is flattered by the"
10335,PREFACE.,consideration that they are the persons at whom the world wonders; add
10336,PREFACE.,"to this, that, in many of them, pride is gratified by their"
10337,PREFACE.,"consequence as new members of a sect whom their conversion pleases,"
10338,PREFACE.,"and by the liberty, which as seceders they take, of speaking"
10339,PREFACE.,"contemptuously of the Church and ministers, whom they have"
10340,PREFACE.,relinquished.
10341,PREFACE.,
10342,PREFACE.,Of those denominated _Calvinistic Methodists_ I had principally one
10343,PREFACE.,"sect in view, or, to adopt the term of its founder, _a church_. This"
10344,PREFACE.,"_church_ consists of several congregations in town and country,"
10345,PREFACE.,"unknown perhaps in many parts of the kingdom, but, where known, the"
10346,PREFACE.,cause of much curiosity and some amusement. To such of my readers as
10347,PREFACE.,may judge an enthusiastic teacher and his peculiarities to be unworthy
10348,PREFACE.,"any serious attention, I would observe that there is something"
10349,PREFACE.,"unusually daring in the boast of this man, who claims the authority of"
10350,PREFACE.,"a messenger sent from God, and declares without hesitation that his"
10351,PREFACE.,call was immediate; that he is assisted by the sensible influence of
10352,PREFACE.,"the Spirit, and that miracles are perpetually wrought in his favour"
10353,PREFACE.,and for his convenience.
10354,PREFACE.,
10355,PREFACE.,As it was and continues to be my desire to give proof that I had
10356,PREFACE.,"advanced nothing respecting this extraordinary person, his operations"
10357,PREFACE.,"or assertions, which might not be readily justified by quotations from"
10358,PREFACE.,"his own writings, I had collected several of these and disposed them"
10359,PREFACE.,under certain heads. But I found that by this means a very
10360,PREFACE.,"disproportioned share of attention must be given to the subject, and"
10361,PREFACE.,"after some consideration, I have determined to relinquish the design;"
10362,PREFACE.,"and, should any have curiosity to search whether my representation of"
10363,PREFACE.,"the temper and disposition, the spirit and manners, the knowledge and"
10364,PREFACE.,"capacity, of a very popular teacher be correct, he is referred to"
10365,PREFACE.,"about fourscore pamphlets, whose titles will be found on the covers of"
10366,PREFACE.,"the late editions of the _Bank of Faith_, itself a wonderful"
10367,PREFACE.,"performance, which (according to the turn of mind in the reader) will"
10368,PREFACE.,"either highly excite, or totally extinguish, curiosity. In these works"
10369,PREFACE.,"will be abundantly seen, abuse and contempt of the Church of England"
10370,PREFACE.,and its ministers; vengeance and virulent denunciation against all
10371,PREFACE.,"offenders; scorn for morality and heathen virtue, with that kind of"
10372,PREFACE.,"learning which the author possesses, and his peculiar style of"
10373,PREFACE.,composition. A few of the titles placed below will give some
10374,PREFACE.,information to the reader respecting the merit and design of those
10375,PREFACE.,performances[32].
10376,PREFACE.,
10377,PREFACE.,As many of the preacher's subjects are controverted and nice questions
10378,PREFACE.,"in divinity, he has sometimes allowed himself relaxation from the"
10379,PREFACE.,"severity of study, and favoured his admirers with the effects of an"
10380,PREFACE.,"humbler kind of inspiration, viz. that of the Muse. It must be"
10381,PREFACE.,"confessed that these flights of fancy are very humble, and have"
10382,PREFACE.,nothing of that daring and mysterious nature which the prose of the
10383,PREFACE.,author leads us to expect. _The Dimensions of eternal_ LOVE is a title
10384,PREFACE.,"of one of his more learned productions, with which might have been"
10385,PREFACE.,expected (as a fit companion) _The Bounds of infinite Grace_; but no
10386,PREFACE.,"such work appears, and possibly the author considered one attempt of"
10387,PREFACE.,this kind was sufficient to prove the extent and direction of his
10388,PREFACE.,abilities.
10389,PREFACE.,
10390,PREFACE.,"Of the whole of this mass of inquiry and decision, of denunciation and"
10391,PREFACE.,"instruction (could we suppose it read by intelligent persons),"
10392,PREFACE.,different opinions would probably be formed; the more indignant and
10393,PREFACE.,"severe would condemn the whole as the produce of craft and hypocrisy,"
10394,PREFACE.,while the more lenient would allow that such things might originate in
10395,PREFACE.,the wandering imagination of a dreaming enthusiast.
10396,PREFACE.,
10397,PREFACE.,"None of my readers will, I trust, do me so much injustice as to"
10398,PREFACE.,suppose I have here any other motive than a vindication of what I have
10399,PREFACE.,"advanced in the verses which describe this kind of character, or that"
10400,PREFACE.,I had there any other purpose than to express (what I conceive to be)
10401,PREFACE.,"justifiable indignation against the assurance, the malignity, and"
10402,PREFACE.,(what is of more importance) the pernicious influence of such
10403,PREFACE.,"sentiments on the minds of the simple and ignorant, who, if they give"
10404,PREFACE.,"credit to his relations, must be no more than tools and instruments"
10405,PREFACE.,under the control and management of one _called to be their Apostle_.
10406,PREFACE.,
10407,PREFACE.,"Nothing would be more easy for me, as I have observed, than to bring"
10408,PREFACE.,"forward quotations such as would justify all I have advanced; but,"
10409,PREFACE.,"even had I room, I cannot tell whether there be not something"
10410,PREFACE.,degrading in such kind of attack: the reader might smile at those
10411,PREFACE.,"miraculous accounts, but he would consider them and the language of"
10412,PREFACE.,the author as beneath his further attention: I therefore once more
10413,PREFACE.,"refer him to those pamphlets, which will afford matter for pity and"
10414,PREFACE.,for contempt by which some would be amused and others astonished--not
10415,PREFACE.,"without sorrow, when they reflect that thousands look up to the writer"
10416,PREFACE.,"as a man literally inspired, to whose wants they administer with their"
10417,PREFACE.,"substance, and to whose guidance they prostrate their spirit and"
10418,PREFACE.,understanding.
10419,PREFACE.,
10420,PREFACE.,"Having been so long detained by this Letter, I must not permit my"
10421,PREFACE.,"desire of elucidating what may seem obscure, or of defending what is"
10422,PREFACE.,"liable to misconstruction, any further to prevail over a wish for"
10423,PREFACE.,"brevity, and the fear of giving an air of importance to subjects which"
10424,PREFACE.,have perhaps little in themselves.
10425,PREFACE.,
10426,PREFACE.,The circumstance recorded in the fifth Letter is a fact; although it
10427,PREFACE.,"may appear to many almost incredible, that, in this country, and but"
10428,PREFACE.,"few years since, a close and successful man should be a stranger to"
10429,PREFACE.,the method of increasing money by the loan of it. The Minister of the
10430,PREFACE.,place where the honest Fisherman resided has related to me the
10431,PREFACE.,apprehension and suspicion he witnessed. With trembling hand and
10432,PREFACE.,"dubious look, the careful man received and surveyed the bond given to"
10433,PREFACE.,"him; and, after a sigh or two of lingering mistrust, he placed it in"
10434,PREFACE.,"the coffer whence he had just before taken his cash; for which, and"
10435,PREFACE.,"for whose increase, he now indulged a belief that it was indeed both"
10436,PREFACE.,promise and security.
10437,PREFACE.,
10438,PREFACE.,If the Letter which treats of Inns should be found to contain nothing
10439,PREFACE.,interesting or uncommon; if it describe things which we behold every
10440,PREFACE.,"day, and some which we do not wish to behold at any time: let it be"
10441,PREFACE.,"considered that this Letter is one of the shortest, and that from a"
10442,PREFACE.,"Poem whose subject was a Borough, populous and wealthy, these places"
10443,PREFACE.,"of public accommodation could not, without some impropriety, be"
10444,PREFACE.,excluded.
10445,PREFACE.,
10446,PREFACE.,"I entertain the strongest, because the most reasonable, hope that no"
10447,PREFACE.,liberal practitioner in the Law will be offended by the notice taken
10448,PREFACE.,of dishonourable and crafty attorneys. The increased difficulty of
10449,PREFACE.,entering into the profession will in time render it much more free
10450,PREFACE.,than it now is from those who disgrace it; at present such persons
10451,PREFACE.,"remain, and it would not be difficult to give instances of neglect,"
10452,PREFACE.,"ignorance, cruelty, oppression, and chicanery; nor are they by any"
10453,PREFACE.,means confined to one part of the country: quacks and impostors are
10454,PREFACE.,"indeed in every profession, as well with a licence as without one. The"
10455,PREFACE.,character and actions of _Swallow_ might doubtless be contrasted by
10456,PREFACE.,the delineation of an able and upright Solicitor; but this Letter is
10457,PREFACE.,"of sufficient length, and such persons, without question, are already"
10458,PREFACE.,known to my readers.
10459,PREFACE.,
10460,PREFACE.,"When I observe, under the article Physic, that the young and less"
10461,PREFACE.,experienced physician will write rather with a view of making himself
10462,PREFACE.,"known, than to investigate and publish some useful fact, I would not"
10463,PREFACE.,be thought to extend this remark to all the publications of such men.
10464,PREFACE.,"I could point out a work, containing experiments the most judicious,"
10465,PREFACE.,"and conclusions the most interesting, made by a gentleman, then young,"
10466,PREFACE.,which would have given just celebrity to a man after long practice.
10467,PREFACE.,The observation is nevertheless generally true: many opinions have
10468,PREFACE.,"been adopted and many books written, not that the theory might be well"
10469,PREFACE.,"defended, but that a young physician might be better known."
10470,PREFACE.,
10471,PREFACE.,If I have in one Letter praised the good-humour of a man confessedly
10472,PREFACE.,"too inattentive to business, and, in another, if I have written"
10473,PREFACE.,"somewhat sarcastically of ""the brick-floored parlour which the butcher"
10474,PREFACE.,"lets:"" be credit given to me, that in the one case I had no intention"
10475,PREFACE.,"to apologize for idleness, nor any design in the other to treat with"
10476,PREFACE.,contempt the resources of the poor. The good-humour is considered as
10477,PREFACE.,"the consolation of disappointment, and the room is so mentioned"
10478,PREFACE.,because the lodger is vain. Most of my readers will perceive this; but
10479,PREFACE.,I shall be sorry if by any I am supposed to make pleas for the vices
10480,PREFACE.,"of men, or treat their wants and infirmities with derision or with"
10481,PREFACE.,disdain.
10482,PREFACE.,
10483,PREFACE.,"It is probable, that really polite people, with cultivated minds and"
10484,PREFACE.,"harmonious tempers, may judge my description of a Card-club"
10485,PREFACE.,"conversation to be highly exaggerated, if not totally fictitious; and"
10486,PREFACE.,I acknowledge that the club must admit a particular kind of members to
10487,PREFACE.,"afford such specimens of acrimony and objurgation. Yet, that such"
10488,PREFACE.,"language is spoken, and such manners exhibited, is most certain,"
10489,PREFACE.,"chiefly among those who, being successful in life, without previous"
10490,PREFACE.,"education, not very nice in their feelings, or very attentive to"
10491,PREFACE.,"improprieties, sit down to game with no other view than that of adding"
10492,PREFACE.,the gain of the evening to the profits of the day; whom therefore
10493,PREFACE.,"disappointment itself makes angry, and, when caused by another;"
10494,PREFACE.,resentful and vindictive.
10495,PREFACE.,
10496,PREFACE.,The Letter on Itinerant Players will to some appear too harshly
10497,PREFACE.,"written, their profligacy exaggerated, and their distresses magnified;"
10498,PREFACE.,"but, though the respectability of a part of these people may give us a"
10499,PREFACE.,"more favourable view of the whole body, though some actors be sober,"
10500,PREFACE.,"and some managers prudent: still there is vice and misery left, more"
10501,PREFACE.,"than sufficient to justify my description. But, if I could find only"
10502,PREFACE.,"one woman who (passing forty years on many stages, and sustaining many"
10503,PREFACE.,"principal characters) laments in her unrespected old age, that there"
10504,PREFACE.,was no workhouse to which she could legally sue for admission; if I
10505,PREFACE.,"could produce only one female, seduced upon the boards, and starved in"
10506,PREFACE.,"her lodging, compelled by her poverty to sing, and by her sufferings"
10507,PREFACE.,"to weep, without any prospect but misery, or any consolation but"
10508,PREFACE.,death; if I could exhibit only one youth who sought refuge from
10509,PREFACE.,parental authority in the licentious freedom of a wandering company:
10510,PREFACE.,"yet, with three such examples, I should feel myself justified in the"
10511,PREFACE.,"account I have given.--But such characters and sufferings are common,"
10512,PREFACE.,and there are few of these societies which could not show members of
10513,PREFACE.,"this description. To some, indeed, the life has its satisfactions:"
10514,PREFACE.,"they never expected to be free from labour, and their present kind,"
10515,PREFACE.,"they think, is light; they have no delicate ideas of shame, and"
10516,PREFACE.,therefore duns and hisses give them no other pain than what arises
10517,PREFACE.,"from the fear of not being trusted, joined with the apprehension that"
10518,PREFACE.,they may have nothing to subsist upon except their credit.
10519,PREFACE.,
10520,PREFACE.,"For the Alms-House itself, its Governors and Inhabitants, I have not"
10521,PREFACE.,"much to offer, in favour of the subject or of the characters. One of"
10522,PREFACE.,"these, _Sir Denys Brand_, may be considered as too highly placed for"
10523,PREFACE.,an author (who seldom ventures above middle-life) to delineate; and
10524,PREFACE.,"indeed I had some idea of reserving him for another occasion, where he"
10525,PREFACE.,might have appeared with those in his own rank; but then it is most
10526,PREFACE.,"uncertain whether he would ever appear, and he has been so many years"
10527,PREFACE.,"prepared for the public whenever opportunity might offer, that I have"
10528,PREFACE.,"at length given him place, and though with his inferiors, yet as a"
10529,PREFACE.,"ruler over them. Of these, one (_Benbow_) may be thought too low and"
10530,PREFACE.,"despicable to be admitted here; but he is a Borough-character, and,"
10531,PREFACE.,"however disgusting in some respects a picture may be, it will please"
10532,PREFACE.,"some, and be tolerated by many, if it can boast that one merit of"
10533,PREFACE.,being a faithful likeness.
10534,PREFACE.,
10535,PREFACE.,"_Blaney_ and _Clelia_, a male and female inhabitant of this mansion,"
10536,PREFACE.,are drawn at some length; and I may be thought to have given them
10537,PREFACE.,"attention which they do not merit. I plead not for the originality,"
10538,PREFACE.,"but for the truth, of the character; and, though it may not be very"
10539,PREFACE.,"pleasing, it may be useful to delineate (for certain minds) these"
10540,PREFACE.,mixtures of levity and vice; people who are thus incurably vain and
10541,PREFACE.,determinately worldly; thus devoted to enjoyment and insensible of
10542,PREFACE.,"shame, and so miserably fond of their pleasures, that they court even"
10543,PREFACE.,"the remembrance with eager solicitation, by conjuring up the ghosts of"
10544,PREFACE.,departed indulgences with all the aid that memory can afford them.
10545,PREFACE.,"These characters demand some attention, because they hold out a"
10546,PREFACE.,warning to that numerous class of young people who are too lively to
10547,PREFACE.,"be discreet; to whom the purpose of life is amusement, and who are"
10548,PREFACE.,"always in danger of falling into vicious habits, because they have too"
10549,PREFACE.,"much activity to be quiet, and too little strength to be steady."
10550,PREFACE.,
10551,PREFACE.,The characters of the Hospital-Directors were written many years
10552,PREFACE.,"since, and, so far as I was capable of judging, are drawn with"
10553,PREFACE.,"_fidelity_. I mention this circumstance, that, if any reader should"
10554,PREFACE.,"find a difference in the versification or expression, he will be thus"
10555,PREFACE.,enabled to account for it.
10556,PREFACE.,
10557,PREFACE.,"The Poor are here almost of necessity introduced, for they must be"
10558,PREFACE.,"considered, in every place, as a large and interesting portion of its"
10559,PREFACE.,inhabitants. I am aware of the great difficulty of acquiring just
10560,PREFACE.,notions on the maintenance and management of this class of our
10561,PREFACE.,"fellow-subjects, and I forbear to express any opinion of the various"
10562,PREFACE.,modes which have been discussed or adopted: of one method only I
10563,PREFACE.,"venture to give my sentiments, that of collecting the poor of a"
10564,PREFACE.,"hundred into one building. This admission of a vast number of persons,"
10565,PREFACE.,"of all ages and both sexes, of very different inclinations, habits,"
10566,PREFACE.,"and capacities, into a society, must, at a first view, I conceive, be"
10567,PREFACE.,looked upon as a cause of both vice and misery; nor does anything
10568,PREFACE.,"which I have heard or read invalidate the opinion; happily, it is not"
10569,PREFACE.,"a prevailing one, as these houses are, I believe, still confined to"
10570,PREFACE.,that part of the kingdom where they originated.
10571,PREFACE.,
10572,PREFACE.,"To this subject follow several Letters describing the follies, and"
10573,PREFACE.,"crimes of persons in lower life, with one relation of a happier and"
10574,PREFACE.,more consolatory kind. It has been a subject of greater vexation to me
10575,PREFACE.,"than such trifle ought to be, that I could not, without destroying all"
10576,PREFACE.,"appearance of arrangement, separate these melancholy narratives, and"
10577,PREFACE.,place the fallen Clerk in Office at a greater distance from the Clerk
10578,PREFACE.,"of the Parish, especially as they resembled each other in several"
10579,PREFACE.,"particulars; both being tempted, seduced, and wretched. Yet are there,"
10580,PREFACE.,"I conceive, considerable marks of distinction: their guilt is of"
10581,PREFACE.,different kind; nor would either have committed the offence of the
10582,PREFACE.,"other. The Clerk of the Parish could break the commandment, but he"
10583,PREFACE.,could not have been induced to have disowned an article of that creed
10584,PREFACE.,"for which he had so bravely contended, and on which he fully relied;"
10585,PREFACE.,and the upright mind of the Clerk in Office would have secured him
10586,PREFACE.,"from being guilty of wrong and robbery, though his weak and"
10587,PREFACE.,vacillating intellect could not preserve him from infidelity and
10588,PREFACE.,"profaneness. Their melancholy is nearly alike, but not its"
10589,PREFACE.,"consequences. _Jachin_ retained his belief, and though he hated life,"
10590,PREFACE.,he could never be induced to quit it voluntarily; but _Abel_ was
10591,PREFACE.,driven to terminate his misery in a way which the unfixedness of his
10592,PREFACE.,religious opinions rather accelerated than retarded. I am therefore
10593,PREFACE.,not without hope that the more observant of my readers will perceive
10594,PREFACE.,many marks of discrimination in these characters.
10595,PREFACE.,
10596,PREFACE.,"The Life of _Ellen Orford_, though sufficiently burthened with error"
10597,PREFACE.,"and misfortune, has in it little besides, which resembles those of the"
10598,PREFACE.,"above unhappy men, and is still more unlike that of _Grimes_, in a"
10599,PREFACE.,subsequent Letter. There is in this character cheerfulness and
10600,PREFACE.,"resignation, a more uniform piety, and an immovable trust in the aid"
10601,PREFACE.,"of religion: this, with the light texture of the introductory part,"
10602,PREFACE.,"will, I hope, take off from that idea of sameness which the repetition"
10603,PREFACE.,of crimes and distresses is likely to create. The character of
10604,PREFACE.,"_Grimes_, his obduracy and apparent want of feeling, his gloomy kind"
10605,PREFACE.,"of misanthropy, the progress of his madness, and the horrors of his"
10606,PREFACE.,"imagination, I must leave to the judgment and observation of my"
10607,PREFACE.,"readers. The mind here exhibited is one untouched by pity, unstung by"
10608,PREFACE.,"remorse, and uncorrected by shame: yet is this hardihood of temper and"
10609,PREFACE.,"spirit broken by want, disease, solitude, and disappointment; and he"
10610,PREFACE.,becomes the victim of a distempered and horror-stricken fancy. It is
10611,PREFACE.,"evident, therefore, that no feeble vision, no half-visible ghost, not"
10612,PREFACE.,"the momentary glance of an unbodied being, nor the half-audible voice"
10613,PREFACE.,"of an invisible one, would be created by the continual workings of"
10614,PREFACE.,distress on a mind so depraved and flinty. The ruffian of Mr
10615,PREFACE.,_Scott_[33] has a mind of this nature: he has no shame or remorse: but
10616,PREFACE.,"the corrosion of hopeless want, the wasting of unabating disease, and"
10617,PREFACE.,"the gloom of unvaried solitude, will have their effect on every"
10618,PREFACE.,"nature; and, the harder that nature is, and the longer time required"
10619,PREFACE.,"to work upon it, so much the more strong and indelible is the"
10620,PREFACE.,"impression. This is all the reason I am able to give, why a man of"
10621,PREFACE.,"feeling so dull should yet become insane, should be of so horrible a"
10622,PREFACE.,nature.
10623,PREFACE.,
10624,PREFACE.,That a Letter on Prisons should follow those narratives is
10625,PREFACE.,"unfortunate, but not to be easily avoided. I confess it is not"
10626,PREFACE.,pleasant to be detained so long by subjects so repulsive to the
10627,PREFACE.,"feelings of many as the sufferings of mankind; but, though I assuredly"
10628,PREFACE.,"would have altered this arrangement, had I been able to have done it"
10629,PREFACE.,"by substituting a better, yet am I not of opinion that my verses, or"
10630,PREFACE.,"indeed the verses of any other person, can so represent the evils and"
10631,PREFACE.,"distresses of life as to make any material impression on the mind, and"
10632,PREFACE.,"much less any of injurious nature. Alas! sufferings real, evident,"
10633,PREFACE.,"continually before us, have not effects very serious or lasting, even"
10634,PREFACE.,in the minds of the more reflecting and compassionate; nor indeed does
10635,PREFACE.,it seem right that the pain caused by sympathy should serve for more
10636,PREFACE.,"than a stimulus to benevolence. If, then, the strength and solidity of"
10637,PREFACE.,"truth placed before our eyes have effect so feeble and transitory, I"
10638,PREFACE.,need not be very apprehensive that my representations of Poor-houses
10639,PREFACE.,"and Prisons, of wants and sufferings, however faithfully taken, will"
10640,PREFACE.,excite any feelings which can be seriously lamented. It has always
10641,PREFACE.,"been held as a salutary exercise of the mind, to contemplate the evils"
10642,PREFACE.,"and miseries of our nature. I am not, therefore, without hope, that"
10643,PREFACE.,"even this gloomy subject of Imprisonment, and more especially the"
10644,PREFACE.,"Dream of the condemned Highwayman, will excite in some minds that"
10645,PREFACE.,"mingled pity and abhorrence, which, while it is not unpleasant to the"
10646,PREFACE.,"feelings, is useful in its operation: it ties and binds us to all"
10647,PREFACE.,"mankind by sensations common to us all, and in some degree connects"
10648,PREFACE.,"us, without degradation, even to the most miserable and guilty of our"
10649,PREFACE.,fellow-men.
10650,PREFACE.,
10651,PREFACE.,Our concluding subject is Education; and some attempt is made to
10652,PREFACE.,"describe its various seminaries, from that of the Poor Widow, who"
10653,PREFACE.,"pronounces the alphabet for infants, to seats whence the light of"
10654,PREFACE.,"learning is shed abroad on the world. If, in this Letter, I describe"
10655,PREFACE.,the lives of literary men as embittered by much evil; if they be often
10656,PREFACE.,"disappointed, and sometimes unfitted for the world they improve: let"
10657,PREFACE.,it be considered that they are described as men who possess that great
10658,PREFACE.,"pleasure, the exercise of their own talents, and the delight which"
10659,PREFACE.,"flows from their own exertions; they have joy in their pursuits, and"
10660,PREFACE.,glory in their acquirements of knowledge. Their victory over
10661,PREFACE.,"difficulties affords the most rational cause of triumph, and the"
10662,PREFACE.,"attainment of new ideas leads to incalculable riches, such as gratify"
10663,PREFACE.,"the glorious avarice of aspiring and comprehensive minds. Here, then,"
10664,PREFACE.,I place the reward of learning.--Our Universities produce men of the
10665,PREFACE.,"first scholastic attainments, who are heirs to large possessions, or"
10666,PREFACE.,"descendants from noble families. Now, to those so favoured, talents"
10667,PREFACE.,"and acquirements are, unquestionably, means of arriving at the most"
10668,PREFACE.,elevated and important situations; but these must be the lot of a few.
10669,PREFACE.,"In general, the diligence, acuteness, and perseverance of a youth at"
10670,PREFACE.,"the University, have no other reward than some College honours and"
10671,PREFACE.,"emoluments, which they desire to exchange, many of them, for very"
10672,PREFACE.,"moderate incomes in the obscurity of some distant village: so that, in"
10673,PREFACE.,stating the reward of an ardent and powerful mind to consist
10674,PREFACE.,"principally (I might have said entirely) in its own views, efforts,"
10675,PREFACE.,"and excursions, I place it upon a sure foundation, though not one so"
10676,PREFACE.,elevated as the more ambitious aspire to. It is surely some
10677,PREFACE.,"encouragement to a studious man to reflect, that if he be"
10678,PREFACE.,"disappointed, he cannot be without gratification; and that, if he gets"
10679,PREFACE.,"but a very humble portion of what the world can give, he has a"
10680,PREFACE.,"continual fruition of unwearying enjoyment, of which it has not power"
10681,PREFACE.,to deprive him.
10682,PREFACE.,
10683,PREFACE.,"Long as I have detained the reader, I take leave to add a few words on"
10684,PREFACE.,"the subject of imitation, or, more plainly speaking, borrowing. In the"
10685,PREFACE.,"course of a long Poem, and more especially of two long ones, it is"
10686,PREFACE.,"very difficult to avoid a recurrence of the same thoughts, and of"
10687,PREFACE.,"similar expressions; and, however careful I have been myself in"
10688,PREFACE.,"detecting and removing these kinds of repetitions, my readers, I"
10689,PREFACE.,"question not, would, if disposed to seek them, find many remaining."
10690,PREFACE.,For these I can only plead that common excuse--they are the offences
10691,PREFACE.,"of a bad memory, and not of voluntary inattention; to which I must add"
10692,PREFACE.,the difficulty (I have already mentioned) of avoiding the error. This
10693,PREFACE.,"kind of plagiarism will therefore, I conceive, be treated with lenity;"
10694,PREFACE.,"and of the more criminal kind, borrowing from others, I plead, with"
10695,PREFACE.,"much confidence, ""not guilty."" But while I claim exemption from guilt,"
10696,PREFACE.,I do not affirm that much of sentiment and much of expression may not
10697,PREFACE.,be detected in the vast collection of English poetry: it is sufficient
10698,PREFACE.,"for an author, that he uses not the words or ideas of another without"
10699,PREFACE.,"acknowledgment; and this, and no more than this, I mean, by"
10700,PREFACE.,disclaiming debts of the kind. Yet resemblances are sometimes so very
10701,PREFACE.,"striking, that it requires faith in a reader to admit they were"
10702,PREFACE.,"undesigned. A line in the second Letter,"
10703,PREFACE.,
10704,PREFACE.,"""And monuments themselves memorials need,"""
10705,PREFACE.,
10706,PREFACE.,"was written long before the author, in an accidental recourse to"
10707,PREFACE.,"Juvenal, read--"
10708,PREFACE.,
10709,PREFACE.,"""Quandoquidem data sunt ipsis quoque fata sepulchris."""
10710,PREFACE.,Sat. x. l. 146.
10711,PREFACE.,
10712,PREFACE.,and for this I believe the reader will readily give me credit. But
10713,PREFACE.,there is another apparent imitation in the life of _Blaney_ (Letter
10714,PREFACE.,"xiv), a simile of so particular a kind, that its occurrence to two"
10715,PREFACE.,writers at the same time must appear as an extraordinary event. For
10716,PREFACE.,"this reason I once determined to exclude it from the relation, but, as"
10717,PREFACE.,"it was truly unborrowed, and suited the place in which it stood, this"
10718,PREFACE.,"seemed, on after-consideration, to be an act of cowardice, and the"
10719,PREFACE.,lines are therefore printed as they were written about two months
10720,PREFACE.,before the very same thought (prosaically drest) appeared in a
10721,PREFACE.,"periodical work of the last summer. It is highly probable, in these"
10722,PREFACE.,"cases, that both may derive the idea from a forgotten but common"
10723,PREFACE.,"source; and in this way I must entreat the reader to do me justice, by"
10724,PREFACE.,"accounting for other such resemblances, should any be detected."
10725,PREFACE.,
10726,PREFACE.,I know not whether to some readers the placing two or three Latin
10727,PREFACE.,"quotations to a Letter may not appear pedantic and ostentatious, while"
10728,PREFACE.,both they and the English ones may be thought unnecessary. For the
10729,PREFACE.,necessity I have not much to advance; but if they be allowable (and
10730,PREFACE.,"certainly the best writers have adopted them), then, where two or"
10731,PREFACE.,"three different subjects occur, so many of these mottoes seem to be"
10732,PREFACE.,"required: nor will a charge of pedantry remain, when it is considered"
10733,PREFACE.,that these things are generally taken from some books familiar to the
10734,PREFACE.,"school-boy, and the selecting them is facilitated by the use of a book"
10735,PREFACE.,"of common-place. Yet, with this help, the task of motto-hunting has"
10736,PREFACE.,"been so unpleasant to me, that I have in various instances given up"
10737,PREFACE.,"the quotation I was in pursuit of, and substituted such English verse"
10738,PREFACE.,or prose as I could find or invent for my purpose.

10978,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"The gale's rich balm, and sun-dew's crimson blush,                 150"
10979,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Whose velvet leaf, with radiant beauty dress'd,"

10993,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Various and vast, sublime in all its forms,"

10998,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"In limpid blue, and evanescent green;                              170"
10999,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"And oft the foggy banks on ocean lie,"
11000,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Lift the fair sail, and cheat th' experienced eye[38]."
11001,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Be it the summer-noon: a sandy space
11002,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,The ebbing tide has left upon its place;
11003,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Then, just the hot and stony beach above,"
11004,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Light twinkling streams in bright confusion move
11005,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"(For heated thus, the warmer air ascends,"
11006,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,And with the cooler in its fall contends);
11007,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Then the broad bosom of the ocean keeps
11008,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"An equal motion, swelling as it sleeps,                            180"
11009,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Then slowly sinking; curling to the strand,"
11010,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Faint, lazy waves o'ercreep the ridgy sand,"
11011,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Or tap the tarry boat with gentle blow,"
11012,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"And back return in silence, smooth and slow."
11013,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Ships in the calm seem anchored; for they glide
11014,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"On the still sea, urged solely by the tide;"

11019,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,The quiet surface of the ocean shake;
11020,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,As an awaken'd giant with a frown
11021,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Might show his wrath, and then to sleep sink down."

11023,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Black and unbroken, all the skies o'ershroud."
11024,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Th' unwieldy porpoise through the day before
11025,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Had roll'd in view of boding men on shore;
11026,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"And sometimes hid, and sometimes show'd, his form,"
11027,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Dark as the cloud, and furious as the storm."
11028,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"All where the eye delights, yet dreads, to roam,                 200"
11029,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,The breaking billows cast the flying foam
11030,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Upon the billows rising--all the deep
11031,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Is restless change; the waves so swell'd and steep,"
11032,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Breaking and sinking, and the sunken swells,"
11033,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Nor one, one moment, in its station dwells."
11034,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"But, nearer land, you may the billows trace,"
11035,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,As if contending in their watery chase;
11036,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"May watch the mightiest till the shoal they reach,"
11037,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Then break and hurry to their utmost stretch;
11038,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Curl'd as they come, they strike with furious force,               210"
11039,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"And then, re-flowing, take their grating course,"
11040,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Raking the rounded flints, which ages past"
11041,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Roll'd by their rage, and shall to ages last."
11042,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Far off, the petrel in the troubled way"
11043,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Swims with her brood, or flutters in the spray;"
11044,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"She rises often, often drops again,"
11045,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,And sports at ease on the tempestuous main.
11046,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"High o'er the restless deep, above the reach"
11047,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Of gunner's hope, vast flights of wild-ducks stretch;"

11051,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Day after day, flight after flight, go forth."
11052,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"In-shore their passage tribes of sea-gulls urge,"
11053,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,And drop for prey within the sweeping surge;

11055,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Far back, then turn, and all their force apply,                      }"
11056,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,While to the storm they give their weak complaining cry;             }
11057,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Or clap the sleek white pinion to the breast,"
11058,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,And in the restless ocean dip for rest.                            230
11059,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Darkness begins to reign; the louder wind
11060,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Appals the weak and awes the firmer mind;
11061,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"But frights not him, whom evening and the spray"
11062,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,In part conceal--yon prowler on his way.
11063,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Lo! he has something seen; he runs apace,"
11064,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,As if he fear'd companion in the chase;
11065,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"He sees his prize, and now he turns again,"
11066,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Slowly and sorrowing--""Was your search in vain?"""
11067,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Gruffly he answers, ""'Tis a sorry sight!"
11068,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"A seaman's body; there'll be more to-night!""                       240"
11069,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Hark to those sounds! they're from distress at sea:
11070,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,How quick they come! What terrors may there be!
11071,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Yes, 'tis a driven vessel: I discern"
11072,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Lights, signs of terror, gleaming from the stern;"
11073,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Others behold them too, and from the town"
11074,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,In various parties seamen hurry down;
11075,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Their wives pursue, and damsels urged by dread,"
11076,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Lest men so dear be into danger led;
11077,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Their head the gown has hooded, and their call"
11078,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,In this sad night is piercing like the squall;                     250
11079,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"They feel their kinds of power, and when they meet,"
11080,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Chide, fondle, weep, dare, threaten, or entreat."
11081,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"See one poor girl, all terror and alarm,"
11082,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Has fondly seized upon her lover's arm;
11083,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"""Thou shalt not venture;"" and he answers ""No!"
11084,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"I will not""--still she cries, ""Thou shalt not go."""
11085,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,No need of this; not here the stoutest boat
11086,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Can through such breakers, o'er such billows float;"
11087,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Yet may they view these lights upon the beach,"
11088,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Which yield them hope, whom help can never reach.                  260"
11089,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,From parted clouds the moon her radiance throws
11090,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"On the wild waves, and all the danger shows;"
11091,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"But shows them beaming in her shining vest,"
11092,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Terrific splendour! gloom in glory dress'd!
11093,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"This for a moment, and then clouds again"
11094,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Hide every beam, and fear and darkness reign."
11095,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,But hear we now those sounds? Do lights appear?
11096,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,I see them not! the storm alone I hear:
11097,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,And lo! the sailors homeward take their way;
11098,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Man must endure--let us submit and pray.                           270
11099,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Such are our winter-views; but night comes on--
11100,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Now business sleeps, and daily cares are gone;"
11101,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Now parties form, and some their friends assist"
11102,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,To waste the idle hours at sober whist;
11103,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,The tavern's pleasure or the concert's charm
11104,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Unnumber'd moments of their sting disarm;
11105,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Play-bills and open doors a crowd invite,"
11106,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,To pass off one dread portion of the night;
11107,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,And show and song and luxury combined
11108,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Lift off from man this burthen of mankind.                         280
11109,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Others advent'rous walk abroad and meet
11110,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Returning parties pacing through the street;
11111,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"When various voices, in the dying day,"
11112,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Hum in our walks, and greet us in our way;"
11113,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"When tavern-lights flit on from room to room,"
11114,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"And guide the tippling sailor, staggering home:"
11115,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"There as we pass, the jingling bells betray"
11116,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,How business rises with the closing day:
11117,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Now walking silent, by the river's side,"
11118,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,The ear perceives the rippling of the tide;                        290
11119,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,Or measured cadence of the lads who tow
11120,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Some enter'd hoy, to fix her in her row;"
11121,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Or hollow sound, which from the parish-bell"
11122,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,To some departed spirit bids farewell!

11124,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Far as a verse, with Fancy's aid, can show;"
11125,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,"Of sea or river, of a quay or street,"
11126,_GENERAL DESCRIPTION._,The best description must be incomplete;

11280,_THE CHURCH._,"These all increase, till in unnoticed years"
11281,_THE CHURCH._,The stony tower as gray with age appears;
11282,_THE CHURCH._,"With coats of vegetation, thinly spread,"
11283,_THE CHURCH._,"Coat above coat, the living on the dead."
11284,_THE CHURCH._,"These then dissolve to dust, and make a way"
11285,_THE CHURCH._,"For bolder foliage, nursed by their decay;                          80"
11286,_THE CHURCH._,The long-enduring ferns in time will all
11287,_THE CHURCH._,"Die and depose their dust upon the wall,"
11288,_THE CHURCH._,"Where the wing'd seed may rest, till many a flower"

11292,_THE CHURCH._,"Each has its motto: some contrived to tell,"
11293,_THE CHURCH._,"In monkish rhyme, the uses of a bell[41]--"
11294,_THE CHURCH._,"Such wond'rous good, as few conceive could spring"

11296,_THE CHURCH._,"Enter'd the Church, we to a tomb proceed,"
11297,_THE CHURCH._,Whose names and titles few attempt to read;
11298,_THE CHURCH._,"Old English letters, and those half pick'd out,"
11299,_THE CHURCH._,"Leave us, unskilful readers, much in doubt."
11300,_THE CHURCH._,Our sons shall see its more degraded state;
11301,_THE CHURCH._,The tomb of grandeur hastens to its fate;
11302,_THE CHURCH._,"That marble arch, our sexton's favourite show,"
11303,_THE CHURCH._,With all those ruff'd and painted pairs below--
11304,_THE CHURCH._,The noble lady and the lord who rest
11305,_THE CHURCH._,"Supine, as courtly dame and warrior dress'd--                      100"

11307,_THE CHURCH._,"Mangled and wounded in their war with time,"

11310,_THE CHURCH._,Midway is cleft the arch; the very base
11311,_THE CHURCH._,Is batter'd round and shifted from its place.
11312,_THE CHURCH._,"Wonder not, mortal, at thy quick decay--"
11313,_THE CHURCH._,See! men of marble piece-meal melt away;
11314,_THE CHURCH._,"When whose the image we no longer read,"
11315,_THE CHURCH._,But monuments themselves memorials need[42].                       110
11316,_THE CHURCH._,"With few such stately proofs of grief or pride,"
11317,_THE CHURCH._,"By wealth erected, is our Church supplied;"
11318,_THE CHURCH._,"But we have mural tablets, every size,"
11319,_THE CHURCH._,"That wo could wish, or vanity devise."
11320,_THE CHURCH._,"Death levels man,--the wicked and the just,"
11321,_THE CHURCH._,"The wise, the weak, lie blended in the dust;"
11322,_THE CHURCH._,"And by the honours dealt to every name,"
11323,_THE CHURCH._,The king of terrors seems to level fame.
11324,_THE CHURCH._,"--See here lamented wives, and every wife"
11325,_THE CHURCH._,The pride and comfort of her husband's life;                       120
11326,_THE CHURCH._,"Here to her spouse, with every virtue graced,"
11327,_THE CHURCH._,His mournful widow has a trophy placed;
11328,_THE CHURCH._,"And here 'tis doubtful if the duteous son,"
11329,_THE CHURCH._,"Or the good father, be in praise outdone."
11330,_THE CHURCH._,"This may be nature; when our friends we lose,"
11331,_THE CHURCH._,Our alter'd feelings alter too our views;
11332,_THE CHURCH._,"What in their tempers teased us or distress'd,"
11333,_THE CHURCH._,"Is, with our anger and the dead, at rest;"
11334,_THE CHURCH._,"And much we grieve, no longer trial made,"
11335,_THE CHURCH._,For that impatience which we then display'd;                       130
11336,_THE CHURCH._,Now to their love and worth of every kind
11337,_THE CHURCH._,A soft compunction turns th' afflicted mind;
11338,_THE CHURCH._,"Virtues, neglected then, adored become,"
11339,_THE CHURCH._,And graces slighted blossom on the tomb.
11340,_THE CHURCH._,'Tis well; but let not love nor grief believe
11341,_THE CHURCH._,That we assent (who neither loved nor grieve)
11342,_THE CHURCH._,"To all that praise which on the tomb is read,"
11343,_THE CHURCH._,To all that passion dictates for the dead;
11344,_THE CHURCH._,"But, more indignant, we the tomb deride,"
11345,_THE CHURCH._,Whose bold inscription flattery sells to pride.                    140

11351,_THE CHURCH._,"See! he was liberal, kind, religious, wise,"
11352,_THE CHURCH._,And free from all disgrace and all disguise;
11353,_THE CHURCH._,"His sterling worth, which words cannot express,"
11354,_THE CHURCH._,"Lives with his friends, their pride and their distress."
11355,_THE CHURCH._,"All this of Jacob Holmes? for his the name,                      150"
11356,_THE CHURCH._,"He thus kind, liberal, just, religious?--shame!"
11357,_THE CHURCH._,What is the truth? Old Jacob married thrice;
11358,_THE CHURCH._,"He dealt in coals, and av'rice was his vice;"
11359,_THE CHURCH._,"He ruled the Borough when his year came on,"
11360,_THE CHURCH._,"And some forget, and some are glad he's gone;"
11361,_THE CHURCH._,"For never yet with shilling could he part,"
11362,_THE CHURCH._,"But when it left his hand, it struck his heart."
11363,_THE CHURCH._,"Yet, here will love its last attentions pay,"
11364,_THE CHURCH._,And place memorials on these beds of clay.
11365,_THE CHURCH._,"Large level stones lie flat upon the grave,                        160"
11366,_THE CHURCH._,And half a century's sun and tempest brave;
11367,_THE CHURCH._,But many an honest tear and heart-felt sigh
11368,_THE CHURCH._,Have follow'd those who now unnoticed lie;
11369,_THE CHURCH._,Of these what numbers rest on every side!
11370,_THE CHURCH._,Without one token left by grief or pride;
11371,_THE CHURCH._,"Their graves soon levell'd to the earth, and then"
11372,_THE CHURCH._,Will other hillocks rise o'er other men;
11373,_THE CHURCH._,"Daily the dead on the decay'd are thrust,"
11374,_THE CHURCH._,"And generations follow, ""dust to dust."""
11375,_THE CHURCH._,Yes! there are real mourners--I have seen                        170
11376,_THE CHURCH._,"A fair, sad girl, mild, suffering, and serene;"
11377,_THE CHURCH._,"Attention (through the day) her duties claim'd,"
11378,_THE CHURCH._,And to be useful as resign'd she aim'd;
11379,_THE CHURCH._,"Neatly she dress'd, nor vainly seem'd t' expect"
11380,_THE CHURCH._,"Pity for grief, or pardon for neglect."
11381,_THE CHURCH._,"But, when her wearied parents sunk to sleep,"
11382,_THE CHURCH._,She sought her place to meditate and weep:
11383,_THE CHURCH._,"Then to her mind was all the past display'd,"
11384,_THE CHURCH._,That faithful memory brings to sorrow's aid:
11385,_THE CHURCH._,"For then she thought on one regretted youth,                       180"
11386,_THE CHURCH._,"Her tender trust, and his unquestion'd truth;"
11387,_THE CHURCH._,"In ev'ry place she wander'd where they'd been,"
11388,_THE CHURCH._,"And sadly-sacred held the parting-scene,"
11389,_THE CHURCH._,Where last for sea he took his leave--that place
11390,_THE CHURCH._,With double interest would she nightly trace;
11391,_THE CHURCH._,"For long the courtship was, and he would say,"
11392,_THE CHURCH._,"Each time he sail'd,--""This once, and then the day."""
11393,_THE CHURCH._,"Yet prudence tarried; but, when last he went,"
11394,_THE CHURCH._,He drew from pitying love a full consent.
11395,_THE CHURCH._,"Happy he sail'd, and great the care she took,                    190"
11396,_THE CHURCH._,"That he should softly sleep, and smartly look;"
11397,_THE CHURCH._,"White was his better linen, and his check"
11398,_THE CHURCH._,Was made more trim than any on the deck;
11399,_THE CHURCH._,And every comfort men at sea can know
11400,_THE CHURCH._,"Was hers to buy, to make, and to bestow:"
11401,_THE CHURCH._,"For he to Greenland sail'd, and much she told,"
11402,_THE CHURCH._,How he should guard against the climate's cold;
11403,_THE CHURCH._,"Yet saw not danger; dangers he'd withstood,"
11404,_THE CHURCH._,Nor could she trace the fever in his blood.
11405,_THE CHURCH._,"His messmates smiled at flushings in his cheek,                    200"
11406,_THE CHURCH._,"And he too smiled, but seldom would he speak;"
11407,_THE CHURCH._,"For now he found the danger, felt the pain,"
11408,_THE CHURCH._,With grievous symptoms he could not explain;
11409,_THE CHURCH._,"Hope was awaken'd, as for home he sail'd,"
11410,_THE CHURCH._,"But quickly sank, and never more prevail'd."
11411,_THE CHURCH._,"He call'd his friend, and prefaced with a sigh"
11412,_THE CHURCH._,"A lover's message--""Thomas, I must die."
11413,_THE CHURCH._,"Would I could see my Sally, and could rest"
11414,_THE CHURCH._,"My throbbing temples on her faithful breast,"
11415,_THE CHURCH._,"And gazing go!--if not, this trifle take,                          210"
11416,_THE CHURCH._,"And say, till death I wore it for her sake."
11417,_THE CHURCH._,"Yes! I must die--blow on, sweet breeze, blow on!"
11418,_THE CHURCH._,"Give me one look, before my life be gone,"
11419,_THE CHURCH._,"Oh! give me that, and let me not despair,"
11420,_THE CHURCH._,"One last fond look--and now repeat the prayer."""
11421,_THE CHURCH._,"He had his wish, had more; I will not paint"
11422,_THE CHURCH._,The lovers' meeting: she beheld him faint--
11423,_THE CHURCH._,"With tender fears she took a nearer view,"
11424,_THE CHURCH._,Her terrors doubling as her hopes withdrew;
11425,_THE CHURCH._,"He tried to smile, and, half succeeding, said,                     220"
11426,_THE CHURCH._,"""Yes! I must die;"" and hope for ever fled."
11427,_THE CHURCH._,Still long she nursed him: tender thoughts meantime
11428,_THE CHURCH._,"Were interchanged, and hopes and views sublime."
11429,_THE CHURCH._,"To her he came to die, and every day"
11430,_THE CHURCH._,She took some portion of the dread away;
11431,_THE CHURCH._,"With him she pray'd, to him his Bible read,"
11432,_THE CHURCH._,"Soothed the faint heart, and held the aching head."
11433,_THE CHURCH._,She came with smiles the hour of pain to cheer;
11434,_THE CHURCH._,"Apart, she sigh'd; alone, she shed the tear;"
11435,_THE CHURCH._,"Then, as if breaking from a cloud, she gave                        230"
11436,_THE CHURCH._,"Fresh light, and gilt the prospect of the grave."
11437,_THE CHURCH._,"One day he lighter seem'd, and they forgot"
11438,_THE CHURCH._,"The care, the dread, the anguish of their lot;"
11439,_THE CHURCH._,"They spoke with cheerfulness, and seem'd to think,"
11440,_THE CHURCH._,"Yet said not so--""Perhaps he will not sink."""
11441,_THE CHURCH._,"A sudden brightness in his look appear'd,"
11442,_THE CHURCH._,A sudden vigour in his voice was heard;--
11443,_THE CHURCH._,"She had been reading in the Book of Prayer,"
11444,_THE CHURCH._,"And led him forth, and placed him in his chair;"
11445,_THE CHURCH._,"Lively he seem'd, and spoke of all he knew,                        240"
11446,_THE CHURCH._,"The friendly many, and the favourite few;"
11447,_THE CHURCH._,Nor one that day did he to mind recall
11448,_THE CHURCH._,"But she has treasured, and she loves them all;"
11449,_THE CHURCH._,"When in her way she meets them, they appear"
11450,_THE CHURCH._,Peculiar people--death has made them dear.
11451,_THE CHURCH._,"He named his friend, but then his hand she press'd,"
11452,_THE CHURCH._,"And fondly whisper'd, ""Thou must go to rest;"""
11453,_THE CHURCH._,"""I go,"" he said; but, as he spoke, she found"
11454,_THE CHURCH._,"His hand more cold, and fluttering was the sound!"
11455,_THE CHURCH._,"Then gazed affrighten'd; but she caught a last,                    250"
11456,_THE CHURCH._,A dying look of love--and all was past!
11457,_THE CHURCH._,"She placed a decent stone his grave above,"
11458,_THE CHURCH._,Neatly engraved--an offering of her love;
11459,_THE CHURCH._,"For that she wrought, for that forsook her bed,"
11460,_THE CHURCH._,Awake alike to duty and the dead;
11461,_THE CHURCH._,"She would have grieved, had friends presumed to spare"
11462,_THE CHURCH._,The least assistance--'twas her proper care.
11463,_THE CHURCH._,"Here will she come, and on the grave will sit,"
11464,_THE CHURCH._,"Folding her arms, in long abstracted fit;"
11465,_THE CHURCH._,"But if observer pass, will take her round,                         260"
11466,_THE CHURCH._,"And careless seem, for she would not be found;"
11467,_THE CHURCH._,"Then go again, and thus her hour employ,"
11468,_THE CHURCH._,"While visions please her, and while woes destroy."
11469,_THE CHURCH._,"Forbear, sweet maid! nor be by fancy led"
11470,_THE CHURCH._,To hold mysterious converse with the dead;
11471,_THE CHURCH._,"For sure at length thy [thoughts'], thy [spirit's] pain"
11472,_THE CHURCH._,In this sad conflict will disturb thy brain.
11473,_THE CHURCH._,"All have their tasks and trials; thine are hard,"
11474,_THE CHURCH._,"But short the time, and glorious the reward:"

11597,LETTER III.,"Ruddy and fair, his Sunday-task began;"
11598,LETTER III.,Few live to speak of that soft soothing look

11610,LETTER III.,"Fear was his ruling passion; yet was love,"
11611,LETTER III.,"Of timid kind, once known his heart to move;"
11612,LETTER III.,It led his patient spirit where it paid
11613,LETTER III.,Its languid offerings to a listening maid;
11614,LETTER III.,"She, with her widow'd mother, heard him speak,"
11615,LETTER III.,And sought awhile to find what he would seek.
11616,LETTER III.,"Smiling he came, he smiled when he withdrew,"
11617,LETTER III.,And paid the same attention to the two;
11618,LETTER III.,"Meeting and parting without joy or pain,"

11620,LETTER III.,"The wondering girl, no prude, but something nice,"
11621,LETTER III.,At length was chill'd by his unmelting ice;

11624,LETTER III.,"This not approving, she withdrew till one"
11625,LETTER III.,Came who appeared with livelier hope to run;
11626,LETTER III.,"Who sought a readier way the heart to move,"

11637,LETTER III.,And guarded bosom of the Hebrew youth;
11638,LETTER III.,But with the daughter of the Priest of On
11639,LETTER III.,"The love was lawful, and the guard was gone;                        50"
11640,LETTER III.,"But Joseph's fame had lessen'd in our view,"
11641,LETTER III.,"Had he, refusing, fled the maiden too."
11642,LETTER III.,"Yet our good priest to Joseph's praise aspired,"

11650,LETTER III.,"But from the time he left his favourite maid,"
11651,LETTER III.,To ancient females his devoirs were paid;
11652,LETTER III.,And still they miss him after morning prayer;
11653,LETTER III.,"Nor yet successor fills the Vicar's chair,"

11670,LETTER III.,But let applause be dealt in all we may:
11671,LETTER III.,"Our priest was cheerful, and in season gay;"
11672,LETTER III.,His frequent visits seldom fail'd to please;
11673,LETTER III.,"Easy himself, he sought his neighbour's ease."
11674,LETTER III.,"To a small garden with delight he came,"
11675,LETTER III.,And gave successive flowers a summer's fame;
11676,LETTER III.,These he presented with a grace his own
11677,LETTER III.,"To his fair friends, and made their beauties known,"
11678,LETTER III.,Not without moral compliment: how they
11679,LETTER III.,"""Like flowers were sweet, and must like flowers decay.""             90"
11680,LETTER III.,"Simple he was, and loved the simple truth,"
11681,LETTER III.,Yet had some useful cunning from his youth;
11682,LETTER III.,"A cunning never to dishonour lent,"
11683,LETTER III.,And rather for defence than conquest meant;
11684,LETTER III.,"'Twas fear of power, with some desire to rise,"
11685,LETTER III.,But not enough to make him enemies;
11686,LETTER III.,He ever aim'd to please; and to offend
11687,LETTER III.,Was ever cautious; for he sought a friend;
11688,LETTER III.,"Yet for the friendship never much would pay,                         }"
11689,LETTER III.,"Content to bow, be silent, and obey,                             100 }"
11690,LETTER III.,And by a soothing suff'rance find his way.                           }
11691,LETTER III.,Fiddling and fishing were his arts; at times
11692,LETTER III.,"He alter'd sermons, and he aim'd at rhymes;"
11693,LETTER III.,"And his fair friends, not yet intent on cards,"
11694,LETTER III.,Oft he amused with riddles and charades.
11695,LETTER III.,"Mild were his doctrines, and not one discourse"
11696,LETTER III.,But gain'd in softness what it lost in force:
11697,LETTER III.,Kind his opinions; he would not receive
11698,LETTER III.,"An ill report, nor evil act believe;"
11699,LETTER III.,"""If true, 'twas wrong; but blemish great or small                  110"
11700,LETTER III.,"Have all mankind; yea, sinners are we all."""
11701,LETTER III.,"If ever fretful thought disturbed his breast,"
11702,LETTER III.,"If aught of gloom that cheerful mind oppress'd,"
11703,LETTER III.,It sprang from innovation; it was then
11704,LETTER III.,"He spake of mischief made by restless men,"
11705,LETTER III.,Not by new doctrines: never in his life
11706,LETTER III.,Would he attend to controversial strife;
11707,LETTER III.,"For sects he cared not; ""They are not of us,"
11708,LETTER III.,"Nor need we, brethren, their concerns discuss;"
11709,LETTER III.,"But 'tis the change, the schism at home I feel;                    120"
11710,LETTER III.,"Ills few perceive, and none have skill to heal:"
11711,LETTER III.,Not at the altar our young brethren read
11712,LETTER III.,(Facing their flock) the decalogue and creed;
11713,LETTER III.,"But at their duty, in their desks they stand,"
11714,LETTER III.,"With naked surplice, lacking hood and band:"
11715,LETTER III.,"Churches are now of holy song bereft,"
11716,LETTER III.,And half our ancient customs changed or left;
11717,LETTER III.,"Few sprigs of ivy are at Christmas seen,"
11718,LETTER III.,Nor crimson berry tips the holly's green;
11719,LETTER III.,Mistaken choirs refuse the solemn strain                           130
11720,LETTER III.,"Of ancient Sternhold, which from ours amain"
11721,LETTER III.,"[Comes] flying forth, from aile to aile about,"
11722,LETTER III.,"Sweet links of harmony and long drawn out."""
11723,LETTER III.,"These were to him essentials, all things new"
11724,LETTER III.,"He deem'd superfluous, useless, or untrue;"
11725,LETTER III.,"To all beside indifferent, easy, cold,"
11726,LETTER III.,"Here the fire kindled, and the wo was told."
11727,LETTER III.,"Habit with him was all the test of truth,"
11728,LETTER III.,"""It must be right: I've done it from my youth."""
11729,LETTER III.,"Questions he answer'd in as brief a way,                           140"
11730,LETTER III.,"""It must be wrong--it was of yesterday."""
11731,LETTER III.,"Though mild benevolence our priest possess'd,"
11732,LETTER III.,'Twas but by wishes or by words express'd:
11733,LETTER III.,"Circles in water, as they wider flow,"
11734,LETTER III.,"The less conspicuous, in their progress grow;"
11735,LETTER III.,"And when at last they touch upon the shore,"
11736,LETTER III.,"Distinction ceases, and they're view'd no more."
11737,LETTER III.,"His love, like that last circle, all embraced,"
11738,LETTER III.,But with effect that never could be traced.
11739,LETTER III.,Now rests our Vicar. They who knew him best                      150
11740,LETTER III.,Proclaim his life t' have been entirely rest--
11741,LETTER III.,Free from all evils which disturb his mind
11742,LETTER III.,Whom studies vex and controversies blind.
11743,LETTER III.,The rich approved--of them in awe he stood;
11744,LETTER III.,The poor admired--they all believed him good;
11745,LETTER III.,The old and serious of his habits spoke;
11746,LETTER III.,The frank and youthful loved his pleasant joke;
11747,LETTER III.,"Mothers approved a safe contented guest,"
11748,LETTER III.,And daughters one who back'd each small request:
11749,LETTER III.,In him his flock found nothing to condemn;                         160
11750,LETTER III.,Him sectaries liked--he never troubled them;
11751,LETTER III.,"No trifles fail'd his yielding mind to please,"
11752,LETTER III.,And all his passions sunk in early ease;
11753,LETTER III.,"Nor one so old has left this world of sin,"
11754,LETTER III.,More like the being that he entered in.

12726,_THE ELECTION._,Preserved by common use of seaman's blue.
12727,_THE ELECTION._,"He was a fisher from his earliest day,"
12728,_THE ELECTION._,And placed his nets within the Borough's bay;
12729,_THE ELECTION._,"Where by his skates, his herrings, and his soles,"

12731,_THE ELECTION._,"But, toiling, saved and, saving, never ceased"
12732,_THE ELECTION._,Till he had box'd up twelve score pounds at least.
12733,_THE ELECTION._,"He knew not money's power, but judged it best"

12744,_THE ELECTION._,More safe the money than within your chest;

12746,_THE ELECTION._,"Five pounds for every hundred, every year.""--"
12747,_THE ELECTION._,"""What good in that?"" quoth Daniel, ""for 'tis plain,"
12748,_THE ELECTION._,"If part I take, there can but part remain.""--"
12749,_THE ELECTION._,"""What! you, my friend, so skill'd in gainful things,"
12750,_THE ELECTION._,"Have you to learn what interest money brings?""--                   160"
12751,_THE ELECTION._,"""Not so,"" said Daniel, ""perfectly I know,"

12753,_THE ELECTION._,"""True! and he'll show the more, the more he lends;"
12754,_THE ELECTION._,Thus he his weight and consequence extends;
12755,_THE ELECTION._,"For they who borrow must restore each sum,"
12756,_THE ELECTION._,"And pay for use--What, Daniel, art thou dumb?"""
12757,_THE ELECTION._,"For much amazed was that good man--""Indeed!"""
12758,_THE ELECTION._,"Said he, with glad'ning eye, ""will money breed?"
12759,_THE ELECTION._,"How have I lived? I grieve, with all my heart,"
12760,_THE ELECTION._,For my late knowledge in this precious art:--                      170
12761,_THE ELECTION._,Five pounds for every hundred will he give?
12762,_THE ELECTION._,"And then the hundred?----I begin to live.""--"
12763,_THE ELECTION._,"So he began, and other means he found,"
12764,_THE ELECTION._,"As he went on, to multiply a pound:"
12765,_THE ELECTION._,"Though blind so long to interest, all allow"
12766,_THE ELECTION._,That no man better understands it now.
12767,_THE ELECTION._,"Him in our body-corporate we chose,"
12768,_THE ELECTION._,"And, once among us, he above us rose;"
12769,_THE ELECTION._,"Stepping from post to post, he reach'd the chair,"
12770,_THE ELECTION._,And there he now reposes--that's the mayor.                        180
12771,_THE ELECTION._,"But 'tis not he, 'tis not the kinder few,"
12772,_THE ELECTION._,"The mild, the good, who can our peace renew;"
12773,_THE ELECTION._,"A peevish humour swells in every eye,"
12774,_THE ELECTION._,"The warm are angry, and the cool are shy;"
12775,_THE ELECTION._,There is no more the social board at whist.
12776,_THE ELECTION._,The good old partners are with scorn dismiss'd;
12777,_THE ELECTION._,"No more with dog and lantern comes the maid,"
12778,_THE ELECTION._,To guide the mistress when the rubber's play'd;
12779,_THE ELECTION._,"Sad shifts are made, lest ribbons blue and green"

12781,_THE ELECTION._,"On care and merit none will now rely,"
12782,_THE ELECTION._,'Tis party sells what party-friends must buy;

12792,_THE ELECTION._,Yet if we could th' attendant ills suppress;
12793,_THE ELECTION._,If we could make the sum of mischief less;
12794,_THE ELECTION._,If we could warm and angry men persuade

12797,_THE ELECTION._,"In all our meetings, so in joy to meet:"
12798,_THE ELECTION._,"Much would of glory to the Muse ensue,"

13191,_PROFESSIONS--LAW._,"That pure attention, when the brethren spoke,"
13192,_PROFESSIONS--LAW._,"Was all contrition,--he had felt the wound,"
13193,_PROFESSIONS--LAW._,And with confession would again be sound.
13194,_PROFESSIONS--LAW._,"True, Swallow's board had still the sumptuous treat;"
13195,_PROFESSIONS--LAW._,But could they blame? the warmest zealots eat.
13196,_PROFESSIONS--LAW._,He drank--'twas needful his poor nerves to brace;                  350
13197,_PROFESSIONS--LAW._,He swore--'twas habit; he was grieved--'twas grace.

13207,_PROFESSIONS--LAW._,"And own'd the sum: they did not ask for more,"
13208,_PROFESSIONS--LAW._,Till more was needed; when they call'd for aid--

13266,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,
13267,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Next, to a graver tribe we turn our view,"
13268,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And yield the praise to worth and science due;
13269,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"But this with serious words and sober style,"
13270,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,For these are friends with whom we seldom smile:
13271,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Helpers of men[51] they're call'd, and we confess"
13272,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Theirs the deep study, theirs the lucky guess."
13273,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,We own that numbers join with care and skill
13274,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"A temperate judgment, a devoted will:"
13275,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Men who suppress their feelings, but who feel"
13276,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,The painful symptoms they delight to heal;                          10
13277,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Patient in all their trials, they sustain"
13278,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"The starts of passion, the reproach of pain;"
13279,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"With hearts affected, but with looks serene,"
13280,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Intent they wait through all the solemn scene;
13281,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Glad, if a hope should rise from nature's strife,"
13282,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,To aid their skill and save the lingering life.
13283,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"But this must virtue's generous effort be,"
13284,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And spring from nobler motives than a fee:
13285,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"To the physicians of the soul, and these,"
13286,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Turn the distress'd for safety, hope, and ease.                     20"
13287,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,But as physicians of that nobler kind
13288,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Have their warm zealots, and their sectaries blind;"
13289,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"So among these for knowledge most renown'd,"
13290,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Are dreamers strange, and stubborn bigots found."
13291,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Some, too, admitted to this honour'd name,"
13292,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Have, without learning, found a way to fame;"
13293,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And some by learning:--young physicians write,"
13294,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,To set their merit in the fairest light;
13295,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,With them a treatise is a bait that draws
13296,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Approving voices; 'tis to gain applause,                            30"
13297,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And to exalt them in the public view,"
13298,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,More than a life of worthy toil could do.
13299,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"When 'tis proposed to make the man renown'd,"
13300,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,In every age convenient doubts abound;
13301,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Convenient themes in every period start,"
13302,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Which he may treat with all the pomp of art;
13303,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Curious conjectures he may always make,"
13304,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And either side of dubious questions take.
13305,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"He may a system broach, or, if he please,"
13306,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Start new opinions of an old disease;                               40
13307,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Or may some simple in the woodland trace,"
13308,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And be its patron, till it runs its race;"
13309,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"As rustic damsels from their woods are won,"
13310,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And live in splendour till their race be run;
13311,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"It weighs not much on what their powers be shown,"
13312,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,When all his purpose is to make them known.
13313,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"To show the world what long experience gains,"
13314,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Requires not courage, though it calls for pains;"
13315,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"But, at life's outset to inform mankind,"
13316,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Is a bold effort of a valiant mind.                                 50
13317,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"The great good man, for noblest cause, displays"
13318,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"What many labours taught, and many days;"
13319,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"These sound instruction from experience give,"
13320,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,The others show us how they mean to live;
13321,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"That they have genius, and they hope mankind"
13322,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Will to its efforts be no longer blind.
13323,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"There are, beside, whom powerful friends advance,"
13324,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Whom fashion favours, person, patrons, chance;"
13325,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And merit sighs to see a fortune made
13326,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,By daring rashness or by dull parade.                               60
13327,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,But these are trifling evils; there is one
13328,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Which walks uncheck'd, and triumphs in the sun:"
13329,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"There was a time, when we beheld the quack,"
13330,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"On public stage, the licensed trade attack;"
13331,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,He made his labour'd speech with poor parade;
13332,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And then a laughing zany lent him aid.
13333,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Smiling we pass'd him, but we felt the while"
13334,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Pity so much, that soon we ceased to smile;"
13335,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Assured that fluent speech and flow'ry vest
13336,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Disguised the troubles of a man distress'd.                         70
13337,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"But now our quacks are gamesters, and they play"
13338,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,With craft and skill to ruin and betray;
13339,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"With monstrous promise they delude the mind,"
13340,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And thrive on all that tortures human-kind.
13341,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Void of all honour, avaricious, rash,"
13342,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,The daring tribe compound their boasted trash--
13343,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Tincture or syrup, lotion, drop or pill;"
13344,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,All tempt the sick to trust the lying bill;
13345,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And twenty names of cobblers turn'd to squires,"
13346,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Aid the bold language of these blushless liars.                     80
13347,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"There are among them those who cannot read,"
13348,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And yet they'll buy a patent, and succeed;"
13349,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Will dare to promise dying sufferers aid,--"
13350,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"For who, when dead, can threaten or upbraid?"
13351,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,With cruel avarice still they recommend
13352,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"More draughts, more syrup, to the journey's end:"
13353,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"""I feel it not;""--""Then take it every hour.""--"
13354,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"""It makes me worse;""--""Why, then it shows its power.""--"

13356,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"You're always safe, while you believe and drink.""                   90"
13357,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"How strange to add, in this nefarious trade,"
13358,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,That men of parts are dupes by dunces made:
13359,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,That creatures nature meant should clean our streets
13360,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Have purchased lands and mansions, parks and seats;"
13361,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Wretches with conscience so obtuse, they leave"
13362,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Their untaught sons their parents to deceive;
13363,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And, when they're laid upon their dying-bed,"
13364,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"No thought of murder comes into their head,"
13365,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Nor one revengeful ghost to them appears,"
13366,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,To fill the soul with penitential fears.                           100
13367,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Yet not the whole of this imposing train
13368,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Their gardens, seats, and carriages obtain;"
13369,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Chiefly, indeed, they to the robbers fall,"
13370,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Who are most fitted to disgrace them all.
13371,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"But there is hazard--patents must be bought,"
13372,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Venders and puffers for the poison sought;
13373,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And then in many a paper through the year
13374,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Must cures and cases, oaths and proofs appear;"
13375,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Men snatch'd from graves, as they were dropping in,"
13376,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Their lungs cough'd up, their bones pierced through their skin;    110"
13377,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Their liver all one scirrhus, and the frame"
13378,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Poison'd with evils which they dare not name;
13379,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Men who spent all upon physicians' fees,                             }"
13380,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Who never slept, nor had a moment's ease,                            }"
13381,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Are now as roaches sound, and all as brisk as bees.                  }"
13382,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"If the sick gudgeons to the bait attend,"
13383,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And come in shoals, the angler gains his end;"
13384,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"But, should the advertising cash be spent,"
13385,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Ere yet the town has due attention lent,"
13386,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Then bursts the bubble, and the hungry cheat                       120"
13387,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Pines for the bread he ill deserves to eat:
13388,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"It is a lottery, and he shares perhaps"
13389,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"The rich man's feast, or begs the pauper's scraps."
13390,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"From powerful causes spring th' empiric's gains,"
13391,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Man's love of life, his weakness, and his pains;"
13392,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"These first induce him the vile trash to try,"
13393,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Then lend his name, that other men may buy."
13394,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"This love of life, which in our nature rules,"
13395,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,To vile imposture makes us dupes and tools;
13396,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Then pain compels th' impatient soul to seize                      130
13397,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,On promised hopes of instantaneous ease;
13398,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And weakness too with every wish complies,"
13399,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Worn out and won by importunities.
13400,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Troubled with something in your bile or blood,"
13401,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,You think your doctor does you little good;
13402,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And, grown impatient, you require in haste"
13403,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"The nervous cordial, nor dislike the taste;"
13404,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"It comforts, heals, and strengthens; nay, you think"
13405,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,It makes you better every time you drink;
13406,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"""Then lend your name""--you're loth, but yet confess                140"
13407,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Its powers are great, and so you acquiesce."
13408,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Yet, think a moment, ere your name you lend,"
13409,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"With whose 'tis placed, and what you recommend;"
13410,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Who tipples brandy will some comfort feel,"
13411,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,But will he to the med'cine set his seal?
13412,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Wait, and you'll find the cordial you admire"
13413,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Has added fuel to your fever's fire.
13414,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Say, should a robber chance your purse to spare,"
13415,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Would you the honour of the man declare?
13416,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Would you assist his purpose? swell his crime?                     150
13417,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Besides, he might not spare a second time."
13418,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Compassion sometimes sets the fatal sign,"
13419,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"The man was poor, and humbly begg'd a line;"
13420,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Else how should noble names and titles back
13421,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,The spreading praise of some advent'rous quack?
13422,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"But he the moment watches, and entreats"
13423,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Your honour's name--your honour joins the cheats;
13424,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"You judged the med'cine harmless, and you lent"
13425,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"What help you could, and with the best intent;"
13426,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"But can it please you, thus to league with all                     160"
13427,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Whom he can beg or bribe to swell the scrawl?
13428,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Would you these wrappers with your name adorn,"
13429,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Which hold the poison for the yet unborn?
13430,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,No class escapes them--from the poor man's pay
13431,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,The nostrum takes no trifling part away;
13432,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"See! those square patent bottles from the shop,"
13433,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Now decoration to the cupboard's top;
13434,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And there a favourite hoard you'll find within,"
13435,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Companions meet! the julep and the gin.
13436,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Time too with cash is wasted; 'tis the fate                      170
13437,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Of real helpers to be call'd too late;
13438,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"This find the sick, when (time and patience gone)"
13439,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Death with a tenfold terror hurries on.
13440,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Suppose the case surpasses human skill,"
13441,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,There comes a quack to flatter weakness still;
13442,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"What greater evil can a flatterer do,"
13443,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Than from himself to take the sufferer's view?
13444,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"To turn from sacred thoughts his reasoning powers,"
13445,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And rob a sinner of his dying hours?
13446,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Yet this they, dare and craving to the last,                       180"
13447,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,In hope's strong bondage hold their victim fast:
13448,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"For soul or body no concern have they,                               }"
13449,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"All their inquiry, ""Can the patient pay?                             }"
13450,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And will he swallow draughts until his dying day?""                   }"
13451,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Observe what ills to nervous females flow,"
13452,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"When the heart flutters, and the pulse is low;"
13453,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"If once induced these cordial sips to try,"
13454,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"All feel the ease, and few the danger fly;"
13455,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"For, while obtain'd, of drams they've all the force,"
13456,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"And when denied, then drams are the resource.                      190"
13457,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Nor these the only evils--there are those
13458,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Who for the troubled mind prepare repose;
13459,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"They write: the young are tenderly address'd,"
13460,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Much danger hinted, much concern express'd;"
13461,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"They dwell on freedoms lads are prone to take,"
13462,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Which makes the doctor tremble for their sake;
13463,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Still, if the youthful patient will but trust"
13464,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"In one so kind, so pitiful, and just;"
13465,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"If he will take the tonic all the time,"
13466,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And hold but moderate intercourse with crime:                      200
13467,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"The sage will gravely give his honest word,"
13468,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,That strength and spirits shall be both restored;
13469,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"In plainer English--if you mean to sin,"
13470,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Fly to the drops, and instantly begin."
13471,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Who would not lend a sympathizing sigh,"
13472,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,To hear yon infant's pity-moving cry?
13473,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"That feeble sob, unlike the new-born note,"
13474,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Which came with vigour from the op'ning throat;
13475,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"When air and light first rush'd on lungs and eyes,"
13476,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And there was life and spirit in the cries;                        210
13477,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Now an abortive, faint attempt to weep"
13478,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Is all we hear; sensation is asleep.
13479,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"The boy was healthy, and at first express'd"
13480,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"His feelings loudly, when he fail'd to rest;"
13481,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"When cramm'd with food, and tighten'd every limb,"
13482,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"To cry aloud, was what pertain'd to him;"
13483,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Then the good nurse, (who, had she borne a brain,"
13484,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Had sought the cause that made her babe complain,)"
13485,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Has all her efforts, loving soul! applied,"
13486,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"To set the cry, and not the cause, aside;                          220"
13487,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"She gave her powerful sweet without remorse,"
13488,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"_The sleeping cordial_--she had tried its force,"
13489,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Repeating oft; the infant, freed from pain,"
13490,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Rejected food, but took the dose again,"
13491,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Sinking to sleep; while she her joy express'd,"
13492,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,That her dear charge could sweetly take his rest:
13493,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Soon may she spare her cordial; not a doubt
13494,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Remains but quickly he will rest without.
13495,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"This moves our grief and pity, and we sigh"
13496,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,To think what numbers from these causes die;                       230
13497,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"But what contempt and anger should we show,"
13498,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Did we the lives of these impostors know!
13499,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Ere for the world's I left the cares of school,"
13500,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,One I remember who assumed the fool:
13501,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,A part well suited--when the idler boys
13502,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Would shout around him, and he loved the noise;"
13503,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,They call'd him Neddy;--Neddy had the art
13504,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,To play with skill his ignominious part;
13505,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"When he his trifles would for sale display,"
13506,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And act the mimic for a schoolboy's pay.                           240
13507,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"For many years he plied his humble trade,"
13508,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And used his tricks and talents to persuade;
13509,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"The fellow barely read, but chanced to look"
13510,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Among the fragments of a tatter'd book,"
13511,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Where, after many efforts made to spell"
13512,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"One puzzling word, he found it _oxymel_:"
13513,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"A potent thing, 'twas said, to cure the ills"
13514,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,Of ailing lungs--the _oxymel of squills_.
13515,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Squills he procured, but found the bitter strong,"
13516,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,And most unpleasant; none would take it long;                      250
13517,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,But the pure acid and the sweet would make
13518,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,A med'cine numbers would for pleasure take.
13519,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"There was a fellow near, an artful knave,"
13520,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Who knew the plan, and much assistance gave;"
13521,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"He wrote the puffs, and every talent plied"

13523,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Now all the profit fell to Ned's control,"

13540,_PROFESSIONS--PHYSIC._,"Oh! when his nerves had once received a shock,"

13703,_TRADES._,He both his Flora and his Fauna shows;
13704,_TRADES._,For him is blooming in its rich array
13705,_TRADES._,The glorious flower which bore the palm away;
13706,_TRADES._,"In vain a rival tried his utmost art,"

13719,_TRADES._,While the most wealthy pine and pray for ease;
13720,_TRADES._,"Content not always waits upon success,"
13721,_TRADES._,And more may he enjoy who profits less.

13723,_TRADES._,Jointly the trade to which they both were bred;
13724,_TRADES._,"When fix'd, they married, and they quickly found"
13725,_TRADES._,With due success their honest labours crown'd:
13726,_TRADES._,"Few were their losses, but, although a few,"
13727,_TRADES._,"Walter was vex'd, and somewhat peevish grew:"
13728,_TRADES._,"""You put your trust in every pleading fool,"""
13729,_TRADES._,"Said he to William, and grew strange and cool."
13730,_TRADES._,"""Brother, forbear,"" he answer'd; ""take your due,"

13732,_TRADES._,"Half friends they parted,--better so to close,                     120"
13733,_TRADES._,Than longer wait to part entirely foes.
13734,_TRADES._,"Walter had knowledge, prudence, jealous care;"

13737,_TRADES._,"""Let one mind one, and all are minded then."""
13738,_TRADES._,"Friends he respected, and believed them just;"
13739,_TRADES._,"But they were men, and he would no man trust;"
13740,_TRADES._,"He tried and watch'd his people day and night,--"
13741,_TRADES._,The good it harm'd not; for the bad 'twas right:
13742,_TRADES._,"He could their humours bear, nay disrespect,                       130"
13743,_TRADES._,But he could yield no pardon to neglect;
13744,_TRADES._,"That all about him were of him afraid,"
13745,_TRADES._,"""Was right,"" he said--""so should we be obey'd."""
13746,_TRADES._,"These merchant-maxims, much good-fortune too,                      }"

13749,_TRADES._,William was kind and easy; he complied
13750,_TRADES._,"With all requests, or grieved when he denied;"
13751,_TRADES._,"To please his wife he made a costly trip,"
13752,_TRADES._,To please his child he let a bargain slip;                         140
13753,_TRADES._,"Prone to compassion, mild with the distress'd,                       }"
13754,_TRADES._,"He bore with all who poverty profess'd,                              }"
13755,_TRADES._,"And some would he assist, nor one would he arrest.                   }"
13756,_TRADES._,"He had some loss at sea, bad debts at land,                         }"
13757,_TRADES._,"His clerk absconded with some bills in hand,                        }"
13758,_TRADES._,And plans so often fail'd that he no longer plann'd.                }
13759,_TRADES._,"To a small house (his brother's) he withdrew,"
13760,_TRADES._,At easy rent--the man was not a Jew;
13761,_TRADES._,"And there his losses and his cares he bore,"
13762,_TRADES._,Nor found that want of wealth could make him poor.                 150
13763,_TRADES._,"No, he in fact was rich; nor could he move,"
13764,_TRADES._,But he was follow'd by the looks of love;
13765,_TRADES._,"All he had suffer'd, every former grief,"
13766,_TRADES._,Made those around more studious in relief;
13767,_TRADES._,"He saw a cheerful smile in every face,"
13768,_TRADES._,And lost all thoughts of error and disgrace.
13769,_TRADES._,Pleasant it was to see them in their walk
13770,_TRADES._,"Round their small garden, and to hear them talk;"
13771,_TRADES._,"Free are their children, but their love refrains"
13772,_TRADES._,"From all offence--none murmurs, none complains;                    160"
13773,_TRADES._,"Whether a book amused them, speech or play,"
13774,_TRADES._,"Their looks were lively, and their hearts were gay;"
13775,_TRADES._,"There no forced efforts for delight were made,"
13776,_TRADES._,"Joy came with prudence, and without parade;"
13777,_TRADES._,"Their common comforts they had all in view,"
13778,_TRADES._,"Light were their troubles, and their wishes few;"
13779,_TRADES._,Thrift made them easy for the coming day;
13780,_TRADES._,Religion took the dread of death away;
13781,_TRADES._,"A cheerful spirit still insured content,"
13782,_TRADES._,And love smiled round them wheresoe'er they went.                  170
13783,_TRADES._,"Walter, meantime, with all his wealth's increase,"
13784,_TRADES._,"Gain'd many points, but could not purchase peace;"
13785,_TRADES._,"When he withdrew from business for an hour,"
13786,_TRADES._,"Some fled his presence, all confess'd his power;"
13787,_TRADES._,"He sought affection, but received instead"
13788,_TRADES._,"Fear undisguised, and love-repelling dread;"
13789,_TRADES._,"He look'd around him--""Harriet, dost thou love?""--"
13790,_TRADES._,"""I do my duty,"" said the timid dove;--"
13791,_TRADES._,"""Good Heav'n, your duty! prithee, tell me now--"
13792,_TRADES._,To love and honour--was not that your vow?                         180
13793,_TRADES._,"Come, my good Harriet, I would gladly seek"
13794,_TRADES._,Your inmost thought--Why can't the woman speak?
13795,_TRADES._,"Have you not all things?""--""Sir, do I complain?""--"
13796,_TRADES._,"""No, that's my part, which I perform in vain;"
13797,_TRADES._,"I want a simple answer, and direct--"
13798,_TRADES._,But you evade; yes! 'tis as I suspect.
13799,_TRADES._,"Come then, my children! Watt! upon your knees"
13800,_TRADES._,"Vow that you love me.""--""Yes, sir, if you please.""--"
13801,_TRADES._,"""Again! by Heav'n, it mads me; I require"
13802,_TRADES._,"Love, and they'll do whatever I desire.                            190"
13803,_TRADES._,Thus too my people shun me; I would spend
13804,_TRADES._,A thousand pounds to get a single friend;
13805,_TRADES._,I would be happy--I have means to pay
13806,_TRADES._,"For love and friendship, and you run away;"
13807,_TRADES._,"Ungrateful creatures! why, you seem to dread"
13808,_TRADES._,My very looks; I know you wish me dead.
13809,_TRADES._,"Come hither, Nancy! you must hold me dear;"
13810,_TRADES._,"Hither, I say; why! what have you to fear?"
13811,_TRADES._,"You see I'm gentle--Come, you trifler, come;"
13812,_TRADES._,"My God! she trembles! Idiot, leave the room!                       200"
13813,_TRADES._,Madam! your children hate me; I suppose
13814,_TRADES._,They know their cue; you make them all my foes;
13815,_TRADES._,I've not a friend in all the world--not one:
13816,_TRADES._,"I'd be a bankrupt sooner; nay, 'tis done;"
13817,_TRADES._,In every better hope of life I fail;
13818,_TRADES._,"You're all tormentors, and my house a jail;"
13819,_TRADES._,Out of my sight! I'll sit and make my will--
13820,_TRADES._,"What, glad to go? stay, devils, and be still;"
13821,_TRADES._,"'Tis to your uncle's cot you wish to run,"
13822,_TRADES._,To learn to live at ease and be undone;                            210

14042,_AMUSEMENTS._,"And their own tones, as labouring for the shore--"

14055,_AMUSEMENTS._,"In a small shop she's raffled with a crowd,"
14056,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Breathed the thick air, and cough'd and laugh'd aloud;"
14057,_AMUSEMENTS._,"She, who will tremble if her eye explore"
14058,_AMUSEMENTS._,"""The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor;"""
14059,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Whom the kind doctor charged, with shaking head,"
14060,_AMUSEMENTS._,At early hour to quit the beaux for bed:
14061,_AMUSEMENTS._,"She has, contemning fear, gone down the dance,"
14062,_AMUSEMENTS._,Till she perceived the rosy morn advance;
14063,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Then has she wonder'd, fainting o'er her tea,"
14064,_AMUSEMENTS._,Her drops and juleps should so useless be:                         150
14065,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Ah! sure her joys must ravish every sense,"
14066,_AMUSEMENTS._,Who buys a portion at so vast expense.
14067,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Among those joys, 'tis one at eve to sail"
14068,_AMUSEMENTS._,On the broad river with a favourite gale;
14069,_AMUSEMENTS._,"When no rough waves upon the bosom ride,"
14070,_AMUSEMENTS._,"But the keel cuts, nor rises on the tide;"
14071,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Safe from the stream the nearer gunwale stands,"
14072,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Where playful children trail their idle hands,"
14073,_AMUSEMENTS._,Or strive to catch long grassy leaves that float
14074,_AMUSEMENTS._,On either side of the impeded boat:                                160
14075,_AMUSEMENTS._,"What time the moon, arising, shows the mud"
14076,_AMUSEMENTS._,A shining border to the silver flood;

14078,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Chalk, stones, and stakes, obtain the richest hues;"
14079,_AMUSEMENTS._,"And when the cattle, as they gazing stand,"
14080,_AMUSEMENTS._,Seem nobler objects than when view'd from land.
14081,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Then anchor'd vessels in the way appear,"
14082,_AMUSEMENTS._,"And sea-boys greet them as they pass--""What cheer?"""
14083,_AMUSEMENTS._,"The sleeping shell-ducks at the sound arise,"
14084,_AMUSEMENTS._,And utter loud their unharmonious cries;                           170
14085,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Fluttering, they move their weedy beds among,"
14086,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Or, instant diving, hide their plumeless young."
14087,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Along the wall, returning from the town,"
14088,_AMUSEMENTS._,The weary rustic homeward wanders down;
14089,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Who stops and gazes at such joyous crew,"
14090,_AMUSEMENTS._,And feels his envy rising at the view;
14091,_AMUSEMENTS._,"He the light speech and laugh indignant hears,"
14092,_AMUSEMENTS._,"And feels more press'd by want, more vex'd by fears."
14093,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Ah! go in peace, good fellow, to thine home,"
14094,_AMUSEMENTS._,Nor fancy these escape the general doom;                           180
14095,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Gay as they seem, be sure with them are hearts"
14096,_AMUSEMENTS._,With sorrow tried; there's sadness in their parts.
14097,_AMUSEMENTS._,"If thou couldst see them when they think alone,"
14098,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Mirth, music, friends, and these amusements gone;"
14099,_AMUSEMENTS._,Couldst thou discover every secret ill
14100,_AMUSEMENTS._,"That pains their spirit, or resists their will;"
14101,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Couldst thou behold forsaken Love's distress,"
14102,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Or Envy's pang at glory and success,"
14103,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Or Beauty, conscious of the spoils of Time,"
14104,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Or Guilt, alarm'd when Memory shows the crime--                    190"
14105,_AMUSEMENTS._,"All that gives sorrow, terror, grief, and gloom:"
14106,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Content would cheer thee, trudging to thine home[62]."
14107,_AMUSEMENTS._,"There are, 'tis true, who lay their cares aside,"
14108,_AMUSEMENTS._,And bid some hours in calm enjoyment glide;
14109,_AMUSEMENTS._,Perchance some fair-one to the sober night
14110,_AMUSEMENTS._,Adds (by the sweetness of her song) delight;
14111,_AMUSEMENTS._,"And, as the music on the water floats,"
14112,_AMUSEMENTS._,Some bolder shore returns the soften'd notes;
14113,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Then, youth, beware, for all around conspire"
14114,_AMUSEMENTS._,To banish caution and to wake desire;                              200
14115,_AMUSEMENTS._,"The day's amusement, feasting, beauty, wine,                         }"

14117,_AMUSEMENTS._,"When most unguarded, then to win that heart of thine:                }"
14118,_AMUSEMENTS._,"But see, they land! the fond enchantment flies,"
14119,_AMUSEMENTS._,And in its place life's common views arise.
14120,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Sometimes a party, row'd from town, will land"
14121,_AMUSEMENTS._,"On a small islet form'd of shelly sand,"
14122,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Left by the water when the tides are low,"
14123,_AMUSEMENTS._,But which the floods in their return o'erflow:
14124,_AMUSEMENTS._,"There will they anchor, pleased awhile to view                     210"
14125,_AMUSEMENTS._,"The watery waste, a prospect wild and new;"
14126,_AMUSEMENTS._,The now receding billows give them space
14127,_AMUSEMENTS._,On either side the growing shores to pace;
14128,_AMUSEMENTS._,"And then, returning, they contract the scene,"
14129,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Till small and smaller grows the walk between,"
14130,_AMUSEMENTS._,"As sea to sea approaches, shore to shores,"
14131,_AMUSEMENTS._,Till the next ebb the sandy isle restores.
14132,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Then what alarm! what danger and dismay,"
14133,_AMUSEMENTS._,"If all their trust, their boat should drift away;"
14134,_AMUSEMENTS._,And once it happen'd--gay the friends advanced;                    220
14135,_AMUSEMENTS._,"They walk'd, they ran, they play'd, they sang, they danced;"
14136,_AMUSEMENTS._,"The urns were boiling, and the cups went round,"
14137,_AMUSEMENTS._,And not a grave or thoughtful face was found;
14138,_AMUSEMENTS._,"On the bright sand they trod with nimble feet,"
14139,_AMUSEMENTS._,Dry shelly sand that made the summer-seat;
14140,_AMUSEMENTS._,"The wondering mews flew fluttering o'er the head,"
14141,_AMUSEMENTS._,And waves ran softly up their shining bed.
14142,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Some form'd a party from the rest to stray,"
14143,_AMUSEMENTS._,Pleased to collect the trifles in their way;
14144,_AMUSEMENTS._,"These to behold, they call their friends around--                  230"
14145,_AMUSEMENTS._,"No friends can hear, or hear another sound;"
14146,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Alarm'd, they hasten, yet perceive not why,"
14147,_AMUSEMENTS._,But catch the fear that quickens as they fly.
14148,_AMUSEMENTS._,"For lo! a lady sage, who paced the sand"
14149,_AMUSEMENTS._,"With her fair children, one in either hand,"
14150,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Intent on home, had turn'd, and saw the boat"
14151,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Slipp'd from her moorings, and now far afloat;"
14152,_AMUSEMENTS._,"She gazed, she trembled, and though faint her call,"
14153,_AMUSEMENTS._,"It seem'd, like thunder, to confound them all."
14154,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Their sailor-guides, the boatman and his mate,                     240"
14155,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Had drank, and slept regardless of their state;"
14156,_AMUSEMENTS._,"""Awake!"" they cried aloud; ""Alarm the shore!"
14157,_AMUSEMENTS._,"""Shout all, or never shall we reach it more!"""
14158,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Alas! no shout the distant land can reach,"
14159,_AMUSEMENTS._,Nor eye behold them from the foggy beach.
14160,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Again they join in one loud, powerful cry,                           }"
14161,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Then cease, and eager listen for reply;                              }"

14163,_AMUSEMENTS._,"They shout once more, and then they turn aside,"
14164,_AMUSEMENTS._,To see how quickly flow'd the coming tide;                         250
14165,_AMUSEMENTS._,Between each cry they find the waters steal
14166,_AMUSEMENTS._,"On their strange prison, and new horrors feel;"
14167,_AMUSEMENTS._,Foot after foot on the contracted ground
14168,_AMUSEMENTS._,"The billows fall, and dreadful is the sound;"
14169,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Less and yet less the sinking isle became,"
14170,_AMUSEMENTS._,"And there was wailing, weeping, wrath, and blame."
14171,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Had one been there, with spirit strong and high,"
14172,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Who could observe, as he prepared to die:"
14173,_AMUSEMENTS._,"He might have seen of hearts the varying kind,"
14174,_AMUSEMENTS._,And traced the movement of each different mind;                    260
14175,_AMUSEMENTS._,"He might have seen, that not the gentle maid"
14176,_AMUSEMENTS._,Was more than stern and haughty man afraid;
14177,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Such calmly grieving, will their fears suppress,"
14178,_AMUSEMENTS._,And silent prayers to Mercy's throne address;
14179,_AMUSEMENTS._,"While fiercer minds, impatient, angry, loud,"
14180,_AMUSEMENTS._,Force their vain grief on the reluctant crowd.
14181,_AMUSEMENTS._,"The party's patron, sorely sighing, cried,"
14182,_AMUSEMENTS._,"""Why would you urge me? I at first denied."""
14183,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Fiercely they answer'd, ""Why will you complain,"
14184,_AMUSEMENTS._,"""Who saw no danger, or was warn'd in vain?""                        270"
14185,_AMUSEMENTS._,A few essay'd the troubled soul to calm;
14186,_AMUSEMENTS._,"But dread prevail'd, and anguish and alarm."
14187,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Now rose the water through the lessening sand,"
14188,_AMUSEMENTS._,And they seem'd sinking while they yet could stand;
14189,_AMUSEMENTS._,"The sun went down, they look'd from side to side,"
14190,_AMUSEMENTS._,Nor aught except the gathering sea descried;
14191,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Dark and more dark, more wet, more cold it grew,"
14192,_AMUSEMENTS._,And the most lively bade to hope adieu;
14193,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Children, by love then lifted from the seas,"
14194,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Felt not the waters at the parents' knees,                         280"
14195,_AMUSEMENTS._,"But wept aloud; the wind increased the sound,"
14196,_AMUSEMENTS._,And the cold billows as they broke around.
14197,_AMUSEMENTS._,"""Once more, yet once again, with all our strength,"
14198,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Cry to the land--we may be heard at length."""
14199,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Vain hope, if yet unseen! but hark! an oar,"
14200,_AMUSEMENTS._,That sound of bliss! comes dashing to their shore;
14201,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Still, still the water rises; ""Haste!"" they cry,"
14202,_AMUSEMENTS._,"""Oh! hurry, seamen; in delay we die;"""
14203,_AMUSEMENTS._,"(Seamen were these, who in their ship perceived"
14204,_AMUSEMENTS._,"The drifted boat, and thus her crew relieved.)                     290"
14205,_AMUSEMENTS._,"And now the keel just cuts the cover'd sand,"
14206,_AMUSEMENTS._,Now to the gunwale stretches every hand;
14207,_AMUSEMENTS._,"With trembling pleasure all confused embark,"
14208,_AMUSEMENTS._,And kiss the tackling of their welcome ark;
14209,_AMUSEMENTS._,"While the most giddy, as they reach the shore,"
14210,_AMUSEMENTS._,"Think of their danger, and their GOD adore."

14393,_CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS._,Thus it appears these envied clubs possess
14394,_CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS._,No certain means of social happiness;

14400,_CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS._,To claim attention and to talk alone:
14401,_CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS._,But here he meets with neither son nor spouse;
14402,_CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS._,No humble cousin to his bidding bows;
14403,_CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS._,To his raised voice his neighbours' voices rise;
14404,_CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS._,To his high look as lofty look replies;
14405,_CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS._,"When much he speaks, he finds that ears are closed,"
14406,_CLUBS AND SOCIAL MEETINGS._,And certain signs inform him when he's prosed;                      90

14728,_INNS._,"All the comforts of life in a tavern are known,"
14729,_INNS._,'Tis his home who possesses not one of his own;
14730,_INNS._,"And to him who has rather too much of that one,"
14731,_INNS._,'Tis the house of a friend where he's welcome to run:
14732,_INNS._,"The instant you enter my door you're my lord,"

14739,_INNS._,"You must pay with observance the price of your treat,"
14740,_INNS._,"You must eat what is praised, and must praise what you eat:"
14741,_INNS._,"But here you may come, and no tax we require,"
14742,_INNS._,You may loudly condemn what you greatly admire;

14750,_INNS._,"Should rebellions arise in your own little state,"
14751,_INNS._,With me you may safely their consequence wait;

14785,_INNS._,Thou mad'st a Shilling splendid; thou hast thrown
14786,_INNS._,On humble themes the graces all thine own;                          10
14787,_INNS._,By thee the Mistress of a village-school

14798,_INNS._,"His eyes are glaring, and his nostrils wide;"
14799,_INNS._,In silver shag the sovereign form is dress'd;
14800,_INNS._,A mane horrific sweeps his ample chest;
14801,_INNS._,"Elate with pride, he seems t' assert his reign,"
14802,_INNS._,"And stands, the glory of his wide domain."
14803,_INNS._,"Yet nothing dreadful to his friends the sight,"

14815,_INNS._,"Whiskeys and gigs and curricles are there,"

14833,_INNS._,"Unlike the nobler beast, the Bear is bound,"

14835,_INNS._,"Less his dominion, but alert are all"

14847,_INNS._,"A thriving couple here their skill display,"
14848,_INNS._,And share the profits of no vulgar sway.
14849,_INNS._,Third in our Borough's list appears the sign
14850,_INNS._,Of a fair queen--the gracious Caroline;
14851,_INNS._,But in decay--each feature in the face
14852,_INNS._,"Has stain of Time, and token of disgrace."
14853,_INNS._,"The storm of winter, and the summer-sun,"
14854,_INNS._,Have on that form their equal mischief done;
14855,_INNS._,"The features now are all disfigured seen,"
14856,_INNS._,And not one charm adorns th' insulted queen:                        80
14857,_INNS._,"To this poor face was never paint applied,"
14858,_INNS._,Th' unseemly work of cruel Time to hide;
14859,_INNS._,Here we may rightly such neglect upbraid;
14860,_INNS._,Paint on such faces is by prudence laid.
14861,_INNS._,"Large the domain, but all within combine"
14862,_INNS._,To correspond with the dishonour'd sign;
14863,_INNS._,And all around dilapidates; you call--
14864,_INNS._,But none replies--they're inattentive all.
14865,_INNS._,"At length a ruin'd stable holds your steed,"
14866,_INNS._,"While you through large and dirty rooms proceed,                    90"
14867,_INNS._,Spacious and cold; a proof they once had been
14868,_INNS._,In honour--now magnificently mean;
14869,_INNS._,"Till in some small half-furnish'd room you rest,"
14870,_INNS._,Whose dying fire denotes it had a guest.
14871,_INNS._,"In those you pass'd where former splendour reign'd,"
14872,_INNS._,"You saw the carpets torn, the paper stain'd;"
14873,_INNS._,"Squares of discordant glass in windows fix'd,"
14874,_INNS._,And paper oil'd in many a space betwixt;
14875,_INNS._,"A soil'd and broken sconce; a mirror crack'd,"
14876,_INNS._,"With table underpropp'd, and chairs new-back'd;                    100"
14877,_INNS._,"A marble side-slab with ten thousand stains,"
14878,_INNS._,And all an ancient tavern's poor remains.
14879,_INNS._,"With much entreaty, they your food prepare,"
14880,_INNS._,"And acid wine afford, with meagre fare;"
14881,_INNS._,Heartless you sup; and when a dozen times
14882,_INNS._,You've read the fractured window's senseless rhymes;
14883,_INNS._,"Have been assured that Phoebe Green was fair,"
14884,_INNS._,And Peter Jackson took his supper there:
14885,_INNS._,"You reach a chilling chamber, where you dread"
14886,_INNS._,"Damps, hot or cold, from a tremendous bed;                         110"
14887,_INNS._,"Late comes your sleep, and you are waken'd soon"
14888,_INNS._,By rustling tatters of the old festoon.
14889,_INNS._,"O'er this large building, thus by time defaced,"
14890,_INNS._,"A servile couple has its owner placed,"
14891,_INNS._,"Who, not unmindful that its style is large,"
14892,_INNS._,To lost magnificence adapt their charge.
14893,_INNS._,"Thus an old beauty, who has long declined,"
14894,_INNS._,Keeps former dues and dignity in mind;
14895,_INNS._,And wills that all attention should be paid
14896,_INNS._,For graces vanish'd and for charms decay'd.                        120
14897,_INNS._,"Few years have pass'd, since brightly 'cross the way"
14898,_INNS._,"Lights from each window shot the lengthen'd ray,"
14899,_INNS._,"And busy looks in every face were seen,"
14900,_INNS._,Through the warm precincts of the reigning Queen.
14901,_INNS._,"There fires inviting blazed, and all around"
14902,_INNS._,Was heard the tinkling bells' seducing sound;
14903,_INNS._,The nimble waiters to that sound from far
14904,_INNS._,"Sprang to the call, then hasten'd to the bar;"
14905,_INNS._,"Where a glad priestess of the temple sway'd,"
14906,_INNS._,"The most obedient, and the most obey'd;                            130"
14907,_INNS._,"Rosy and round, adorn'd in crimson vest,"
14908,_INNS._,"And flaming ribands at her ample breast,"
14909,_INNS._,"She, skill'd like Circe, tried her guests to move"
14910,_INNS._,With looks of welcome and with words of love;
14911,_INNS._,"And such her potent charms, that men unwise"
14912,_INNS._,Were soon transform'd and fitted for the sties.
14913,_INNS._,"Her port in bottles stood, a well-stain'd row,"
14914,_INNS._,Drawn for the evening from the pipe below;
14915,_INNS._,Three powerful spirits fill'd a parted case;
14916,_INNS._,Some cordial-bottles stood in secret place;                        140
14917,_INNS._,Fair acid fruits in nets above were seen;
14918,_INNS._,"Her plate was splendid, and her glasses clean;"
14919,_INNS._,"Basins and bowls were ready on the stand,"
14920,_INNS._,And measures clatter'd in her powerful hand.
14921,_INNS._,"Inferior houses now our notice claim,"
14922,_INNS._,But who shall deal them their appropriate fame?
14923,_INNS._,"Who shall the nice, yet known distinction, tell,"
14924,_INNS._,Between the peal complete and single bell?
14925,_INNS._,"Determine, ye, who on your shining nags"
14926,_INNS._,Wear oil-skin beavers and bear seal-skin bags;                     150
14927,_INNS._,"Or ye, grave topers, who with coy delight"
14928,_INNS._,Snugly enjoy the sweetness of the night;

14932,_INNS._,"At the _full_ orb, or _half_ the lunar face?"
14933,_INNS._,With the Black-Boy or Angel will ye dine?
14934,_INNS._,Will ye approve the Fountain or the Vine?
14935,_INNS._,Horses the _white_ or _black_ will ye prefer?
14936,_INNS._,"The Silver-Swan, or swan opposed to her--                          160"
14937,_INNS._,"Rare bird! whose form the raven-plumage decks,"
14938,_INNS._,And graceful curve her three alluring necks?
14939,_INNS._,"All these a decent entertainment give,"
14940,_INNS._,And by their comforts comfortably live.
14941,_INNS._,"Shall I pass by the Boar?--there are who cry,"
14942,_INNS._,"""Beware the Boar,"" and pass determined by:"
14943,_INNS._,"Those dreadful tusks, those little peering eyes"

14947,_INNS._,"Poor village nieces, whom the tender dame"
14948,_INNS._,"Invites to town, and gives their beauty fame;"
14949,_INNS._,"The grateful sisters feel th' important aid,"
14950,_INNS._,And the good aunt is flatter'd and repaid.
14951,_INNS._,"What though it may some cool observers strike,"
14952,_INNS._,That such fair sisters should be so unlike;
14953,_INNS._,"That still another and another comes,"
14954,_INNS._,And at the matron's table smiles and blooms;
14955,_INNS._,That all appear as if they meant to stay
14956,_INNS._,"Time undefined, nor name a parting day;                            180"
14957,_INNS._,"And yet, though all are valued, all are dear,"
14958,_INNS._,"Causeless, they go, and seldom more appear:"
14959,_INNS._,"Yet--let Suspicion hide her odious head,"
14960,_INNS._,And Scandal vengeance from a burgess dread--
14961,_INNS._,"A pious friend, who with the ancient dame"
14962,_INNS._,At sober cribbage takes an evening game;
14963,_INNS._,"His cup beside him, through their play he quaffs,"
14964,_INNS._,"And oft renews, and innocently laughs;"
14965,_INNS._,"Or, growing serious, to the text resorts,"
14966,_INNS._,And from the Sunday-sermon makes reports;                          190
14967,_INNS._,"While all, with grateful glee, his wish attend,"
14968,_INNS._,A grave protector and a powerful friend.
14969,_INNS._,"But Slander says, who indistinctly sees,"
14970,_INNS._,Once he was caught with Silvia on his knees--
14971,_INNS._,A cautious burgess with a careful wife
14972,_INNS._,"To be so caught!--'tis false, upon my life."
14973,_INNS._,"Next are a lower kind, yet not so low"
14974,_INNS._,"But they, among them, their distinctions know;"
14975,_INNS._,"And, when a thriving landlord aims so high"
14976,_INNS._,"As to exchange the Chequer for the Pye,                            200"
14977,_INNS._,"Or from Duke William to the Dog repairs,"
14978,_INNS._,He takes a finer coat and fiercer airs.
14979,_INNS._,"Pleased with his power, the poor man loves to say"
14980,_INNS._,What favourite inn shall share his evening's pay;
14981,_INNS._,"Where he shall sit the social hour, and lose"
14982,_INNS._,His past day's labours and his next day's views.
14983,_INNS._,Our seamen too have choice: one takes a trip
14984,_INNS._,In the warm cabin of his favourite ship;
14985,_INNS._,And on the morrow in the humbler boat
14986,_INNS._,"He rows, till fancy feels herself afloat;                          210"
14987,_INNS._,"Can he the sign--Three Jolly Sailors pass,"
14988,_INNS._,Who hears a fiddle and who sees a lass?
14989,_INNS._,"The Anchor too affords the seaman joys,"
14990,_INNS._,"In small smoked room, all clamour, crowd, and noise;"
14991,_INNS._,"Where a curved settle half surrounds the fire,"
14992,_INNS._,Where fifty voices purl and punch require.
14993,_INNS._,"They come for pleasure in their leisure hour,"
14994,_INNS._,And they enjoy it to their utmost power;
14995,_INNS._,"Standing they drink, they swearing smoke, while all"

14998,_INNS._,"We drink and drub the French extempore."""
14999,_INNS._,"See! round the room, on every beam and balk,"
15000,_INNS._,Are mingled scrolls of hieroglyphic chalk;

15005,_INNS._,"But the Green-Man shall I pass by unsung,"
15006,_INNS._,Which mine own James upon his sign-post hung?                      230
15007,_INNS._,"His sign, his image,--for he once was seen"
15008,_INNS._,"A squire's attendant, clad in keeper's green;"
15009,_INNS._,"Ere yet, with wages more, and honour less,"
15010,_INNS._,He stood behind me in a graver dress.
15011,_INNS._,James in an evil hour went forth to woo
15012,_INNS._,"Young Juliet Hart, and was her Romeo:"
15013,_INNS._,"They'd seen the play, and thought it vastly sweet"
15014,_INNS._,For two young lovers by the moon to meet;
15015,_INNS._,"The nymph was gentle, of her favours free,"
15016,_INNS._,Ev'n at a word--no Rosalind was she;                               240
15017,_INNS._,"Nor, like that other Juliet, tried his truth"

15020,_INNS._,"When sang the lark, and when the nightingale:"
15021,_INNS._,So in few months the generous lass was seen
15022,_INNS._,I' the way that all the Capulets had been.
15023,_INNS._,"Then first repentance seized the amorous man,"
15024,_INNS._,And--shame on love--he reason'd and he ran;
15025,_INNS._,"The thoughtful Romeo trembled for his purse,"
15026,_INNS._,"And the sad sounds, ""for better and for worse.""                    250"
15027,_INNS._,"Yet could the lover not so far withdraw,"
15028,_INNS._,But he was haunted both by love and law:
15029,_INNS._,"Now law dismay'd him as he view'd its fangs,"
15030,_INNS._,Now pity seized him for his Juliet's pangs;
15031,_INNS._,"Then thoughts of justice and some dread of jail,"
15032,_INNS._,Where all would blame him and where none might bail;
15033,_INNS._,"These drew him back, till Juliet's hut appear'd,"
15034,_INNS._,Where love had drawn him when he should have fear'd.
15035,_INNS._,"There sat the father in his wicker throne,"
15036,_INNS._,Uttering his curses in tremendous tone;                            260
15037,_INNS._,"With foulest names his daughter he reviled,"
15038,_INNS._,And look'd a very Herod at the child:

15041,_INNS._,"Then rose the mother, eager to begin"

15043,_INNS._,"To him she turn'd, and other theme began,"

15047,_INNS._,With lengthened speech she proved what came to pass

15058,_INNS._,I hate to hear of villany and crime.
15059,_INNS._,"'Twas my misfortune, in the days of youth,"
15060,_INNS._,To find two lasses pleading for my truth;
15061,_INNS._,"The case was hard, I would with all my soul"
15062,_INNS._,"Have wedded both, but law is our control;"
15063,_INNS._,"So one I took, and when we gain'd a home,"
15064,_INNS._,Her friend agreed--what could she more?--to come;
15065,_INNS._,"And when she found that I'd a widow'd bed,"
15066,_INNS._,Me she desired--what could I less?--to wed.                        290
15067,_INNS._,An easier case is yours: you've not the smart

15070,_INNS._,Before your conscience can be laid at rest;

15080,_INNS._,Denying her who taught thee to deny:
15081,_INNS._,"But, James, with me thou hadst an easier task,"
15082,_INNS._,Bonds and conditions I forbore to ask;
15083,_INNS._,"""I laid no traps for thee, no plots or plans,"

15248,_PLAYERS._,When struggles more and more severe are seen
15249,_PLAYERS._,In the plain actress than the Danish queen;--
15250,_PLAYERS._,"At length she feels her part, she finds delight,"

15269,_PLAYERS._,"Her judgment weak, and her conclusions wrong."

15274,_PLAYERS._,"At length the hero of the boards drew nigh,"
15275,_PLAYERS._,Who spake of love till sigh re-echo'd sigh;
15276,_PLAYERS._,"He told in honey'd words his deathless flame,"
15277,_PLAYERS._,And she his own by tender vows became;                             140
15278,_PLAYERS._,"Nor ring nor licence needed souls so fond,"
15279,_PLAYERS._,Alphonso's passion was his Cynthia's bond:

15289,_PLAYERS._,"Increase of evils--is an early grave,"
15290,_PLAYERS._,"Ye gentle Cynthias of the shop, take heed"

15304,_PLAYERS._,"And, as he felt the bliss, he wish'd to know"
15305,_PLAYERS._,Whence all this rapture and these joys could flow;
15306,_PLAYERS._,"For, if the seeing could such pleasure bring,"
15307,_PLAYERS._,What must the feeling?--feeling like a king?                       170
15308,_PLAYERS._,"In vain his wife, his uncle, and his friend,"
15309,_PLAYERS._,"Cried--""Peter! Peter! let such follies end;"

15313,_PLAYERS._,"And Roscius-Garrick, by the science thrive?"
15314,_PLAYERS._,Showman!--'tis scandal; I'm by genius led
15315,_PLAYERS._,"To join a class who've Shakspeare at their head."""
15316,_PLAYERS._,Poor Peter thus by easy steps became
15317,_PLAYERS._,A dreaming candidate for scenic fame;                              180
15318,_PLAYERS._,"And, after years consumed, infirm and poor,"
15319,_PLAYERS._,He sits and takes the tickets at the door.
15320,_PLAYERS._,Of various men these marching troops are made--
15321,_PLAYERS._,"Pen-spurning clerks, and lads contemning trade;"
15322,_PLAYERS._,"Waiters and servants by confinement teased,"
15323,_PLAYERS._,And youths of wealth by dissipation eased;
15324,_PLAYERS._,"With feeling nymphs, who, such resource at hand,"
15325,_PLAYERS._,Scorn to obey the rigour of command;
15326,_PLAYERS._,"Some, who from higher views by vice are won,"
15327,_PLAYERS._,And some of either sex by love undone;                             190
15328,_PLAYERS._,The greater part lamenting as their fall
15329,_PLAYERS._,What some an honour and advancement call.
15330,_PLAYERS._,"There are who names in shame or fear assume,"
15331,_PLAYERS._,And hence our Bevilles and our Savilles come:
15332,_PLAYERS._,"It honours him, from tailor's board kick'd down,"
15333,_PLAYERS._,As Mister Dormer to amuse the town;
15334,_PLAYERS._,"Falling, he rises: but a kind there are"
15335,_PLAYERS._,"Who dwell on former prospects, and despair;"
15336,_PLAYERS._,"Justly, but vainly, they their fate deplore,"
15337,_PLAYERS._,And mourn their fall who fell to rise no more.                     200
15338,_PLAYERS._,"Our merchant Thompson, with his sons around,"
15339,_PLAYERS._,Most mind and talent in his Frederick found:
15340,_PLAYERS._,"He was so lively, that his mother knew,"
15341,_PLAYERS._,"If he were taught, that honour must ensue;"
15342,_PLAYERS._,The father's views were in a different line;
15343,_PLAYERS._,"But if at college he were sure to shine,"
15344,_PLAYERS._,"Then should he go--to prosper, who could doubt--"
15345,_PLAYERS._,When school-boy stigmas would be all wash'd out;
15346,_PLAYERS._,"For there were marks upon his youthful face,"
15347,_PLAYERS._,'Twixt vice and error--a neglected case:                           210
15348,_PLAYERS._,"These would submit to skill; a little time,"
15349,_PLAYERS._,And none could trace the error or the crime;
15350,_PLAYERS._,"Then let him go, and once at college, he"
15351,_PLAYERS._,Might choose his station--what would Frederick be?
15352,_PLAYERS._,'Twas soon determined.--He could not descend
15353,_PLAYERS._,To pedant-laws and lectures without end;
15354,_PLAYERS._,"And then the chapel--night and morn to pray,"
15355,_PLAYERS._,Or mulct and threaten'd if he kept away;
15356,_PLAYERS._,"No! not to be a bishop--so he swore,"
15357,_PLAYERS._,And at his college he was seen no more.                            220
15358,_PLAYERS._,"His debts all paid, the father with a sigh,"
15359,_PLAYERS._,"Placed him in office--""Do, my Frederick, try;"
15360,_PLAYERS._,"""Confine thyself a few short months, and then----"""
15361,_PLAYERS._,"He tried a fortnight, and threw down the pen."
15362,_PLAYERS._,"Again demands were hush'd: ""My son, you're free,"
15363,_PLAYERS._,"But you're unsettled; take your chance at sea:"""
15364,_PLAYERS._,"So in few days the midshipman equipp'd,"
15365,_PLAYERS._,Received the mother's blessing and was shipp'd.
15366,_PLAYERS._,Hard was her fortune! soon compell'd to meet
15367,_PLAYERS._,The wretched stripling staggering through the street;              230
15368,_PLAYERS._,"For, rash, impetuous, insolent and vain,"
15369,_PLAYERS._,The captain sent him to his friends again.
15370,_PLAYERS._,"About the borough roved th' unhappy boy,"
15371,_PLAYERS._,And ate the bread of every chance-employ;
15372,_PLAYERS._,"Of friends he borrow'd, and the parents yet"
15373,_PLAYERS._,In secret fondness authorised the debt;
15374,_PLAYERS._,"The younger sister, still a child, was taught"
15375,_PLAYERS._,To give with feign'd affright the pittance sought;
15376,_PLAYERS._,"For now the father cried--""It is too late"
15377,_PLAYERS._,"For trial more--I leave him to his fate""--                         240"
15378,_PLAYERS._,Yet left him not; and with a kind of joy
15379,_PLAYERS._,The mother heard of her desponding boy:
15380,_PLAYERS._,"At length he sicken'd, and he found, when sick,"
15381,_PLAYERS._,"All aid was ready, all attendance quick;"
15382,_PLAYERS._,"A fever seized him, and at once was lost"
15383,_PLAYERS._,"The thought of trespass, error, crime and cost;"
15384,_PLAYERS._,Th' indulgent parents knelt beside the youth;
15385,_PLAYERS._,They heard his promise and believed his truth;
15386,_PLAYERS._,"And, when the danger lessen'd on their view,"
15387,_PLAYERS._,"They cast off doubt, and hope assurance grew;--                    250"
15388,_PLAYERS._,"Nursed by his sisters, cherish'd by his sire,"
15389,_PLAYERS._,"Begg'd to be glad, encouraged to aspire,"
15390,_PLAYERS._,"His life, they said, would now all care repay,"
15391,_PLAYERS._,And he might date his prospects from that day;
15392,_PLAYERS._,"A son, a brother to his home received,"
15393,_PLAYERS._,"They hoped for all things, and in all believed."
15394,_PLAYERS._,"And now will pardon, comfort, kindness, draw"
15395,_PLAYERS._,"The youth from vice? will honour, duty, law?"
15396,_PLAYERS._,"Alas! not all: the more the trials lent,"
15397,_PLAYERS._,The less he seem'd to ponder and repent;                           260
15398,_PLAYERS._,"Headstrong, determined in his own career,"
15399,_PLAYERS._,He thought reproof unjust and truth severe;
15400,_PLAYERS._,"The soul's disease was to its crisis come,"
15401,_PLAYERS._,He first abused and then abjured his home;
15402,_PLAYERS._,"And when he chose a vagabond to be,"
15403,_PLAYERS._,"He made his shame his glory--""I'll be free."""
15404,_PLAYERS._,"Friends, parents, relatives, hope, reason, love,"
15405,_PLAYERS._,With anxious ardour for that empire strove;
15406,_PLAYERS._,"In vain their strife, in vain the means applied,"
15407,_PLAYERS._,"They had no comfort, but that all were tried;                      270"
15408,_PLAYERS._,"One strong vain trial made, the mind to move,"
15409,_PLAYERS._,Was the last effort of parental love.
15410,_PLAYERS._,"Ev'n then he watch'd his father from his home,"
15411,_PLAYERS._,"And to his mother would for pity come,"
15412,_PLAYERS._,"Where, as he made her tender terrors rise,"
15413,_PLAYERS._,"He talk'd of death, and threaten'd for supplies."
15414,_PLAYERS._,Against a youth so vicious and undone
15415,_PLAYERS._,"All hearts were closed, and every door but one:"
15416,_PLAYERS._,The players received him; they with open heart
15417,_PLAYERS._,Gave him his portion and assign'd his part;                        280
15418,_PLAYERS._,"And ere three days were added to his life,"
15419,_PLAYERS._,"He found a home, a duty, and a wife."
15420,_PLAYERS._,"His present friends, though they were nothing nice,"
15421,_PLAYERS._,"Nor ask'd how vicious he, or what his vice,"
15422,_PLAYERS._,Still they expected he should now attend
15423,_PLAYERS._,To the joint duty as an useful friend;
15424,_PLAYERS._,"The leader too declared, with frown severe,"
15425,_PLAYERS._,That none should pawn a robe that kings might wear;
15426,_PLAYERS._,"And much it moved him, when he Hamlet play'd,"
15427,_PLAYERS._,To see his Father's Ghost so drunken made.                         290
15428,_PLAYERS._,"Then too the temper, the unbending pride"
15429,_PLAYERS._,Of this ally would no reproof abide:--
15430,_PLAYERS._,"So, leaving these, he march'd away and join'd"
15431,_PLAYERS._,"Another troop, and other goods purloin'd;"
15432,_PLAYERS._,"And other characters, both gay and sage,"
15433,_PLAYERS._,"Sober and sad, made stagger on the stage;"
15434,_PLAYERS._,"Then to rebuke, with arrogant disdain,"
15435,_PLAYERS._,"He gave abuse, and sought a home again."
15436,_PLAYERS._,"Thus changing scenes, but with unchanging vice,"
15437,_PLAYERS._,"Engaged by many, but with no one twice:                            300"
15438,_PLAYERS._,"Of this, a last and poor resource, bereft,"
15439,_PLAYERS._,"He to himself, unhappy guide! was left--"
15440,_PLAYERS._,And who shall say where guided? to what seats
15441,_PLAYERS._,Of starving villany? of thieves and cheats?
15442,_PLAYERS._,"In that sad time, of many a dismal scene"
15443,_PLAYERS._,Had he a witness (not inactive) been;
15444,_PLAYERS._,"Had leagued with petty pilferers, and had crept,"
15445,_PLAYERS._,Where of each sex degraded numbers slept.
15446,_PLAYERS._,"With such associates he was long allied,                               }"
15447,_PLAYERS._,"Where his capacity for ill was tried,                              310 }"
15448,_PLAYERS._,"And, that once lost, the wretch was cast aside;                        }"
15449,_PLAYERS._,"For now, though willing with the worst to act,"
15450,_PLAYERS._,He wanted powers for an important fact;
15451,_PLAYERS._,"And, while he felt as lawless spirits feel,"
15452,_PLAYERS._,"His hand was palsied, and he couldn't steal."
15453,_PLAYERS._,"By these rejected, is there lot so strange,"
15454,_PLAYERS._,"So low, that he could suffer by the change?"
15455,_PLAYERS._,Yes! the new station as a fall we judge--
15456,_PLAYERS._,"He now became the harlot's humble drudge,"
15457,_PLAYERS._,Their drudge in common: they combined to save                      320
15458,_PLAYERS._,Awhile from starving their submissive slave;
15459,_PLAYERS._,"For now his spirit left him, and his pride,"
15460,_PLAYERS._,"His scorn, his rancour, and resentment died;"
15461,_PLAYERS._,"Few were his feelings--but the keenest these,"
15462,_PLAYERS._,"The rage of hunger, and the sigh for ease;"
15463,_PLAYERS._,"He who abused indulgence, now became"
15464,_PLAYERS._,By want subservient and by misery tame;
15465,_PLAYERS._,"A slave, he begg'd forbearance; bent with pain,"
15466,_PLAYERS._,"He shunn'd the blow--""Ah! strike me not again."""
15467,_PLAYERS._,Thus was he found: the master of a hoy                           330
15468,_PLAYERS._,"Saw the sad wretch, whom he had known a boy"
15469,_PLAYERS._,At first in doubt; but Frederick laid aside
15470,_PLAYERS._,"All shame, and humbly for his aid applied."
15471,_PLAYERS._,"He, tamed and smitten with the storms gone by,"
15472,_PLAYERS._,"Look'd for compassion through one living eye,"
15473,_PLAYERS._,And stretch'd th' unpalsied hand; the seaman felt                    }
15474,_PLAYERS._,"His honest heart with gentle pity melt,                              }"
15475,_PLAYERS._,And his small boon with cheerful frankness dealt;                    }
15476,_PLAYERS._,"Then made inquiries of th' unhappy youth,"
15477,_PLAYERS._,"Who told, nor shame forbade him, all the truth.                    340"
15478,_PLAYERS._,"""Young Frederick Thompson to a chandler's shop"
15479,_PLAYERS._,By harlots order'd and afraid to stop!--
15480,_PLAYERS._,What! our good merchant's favourite to be seen
15481,_PLAYERS._,"In state so loathsome and in dress so mean?""--"
15482,_PLAYERS._,"So thought the seaman as he bade adieu,"
15483,_PLAYERS._,"And, when in port, related all he knew."
15484,_PLAYERS._,"But time was lost, inquiry came too late,"
15485,_PLAYERS._,Those whom he served knew nothing of his fate;
15486,_PLAYERS._,"No! they had seized on what the sailor gave,"
15487,_PLAYERS._,Nor bore resistance from their abject slave;                       350
15488,_PLAYERS._,"The spoil obtain'd, they cast him from the door,"
15489,_PLAYERS._,"Robb'd, beaten, hungry, pain'd, diseased and poor."
15490,_PLAYERS._,Then nature (pointing to the only spot
15491,_PLAYERS._,"Which still had comfort for so dire a lot,)"
15492,_PLAYERS._,"Although so feeble, led him on the way,"
15493,_PLAYERS._,And hope look'd forward to a happier day.
15494,_PLAYERS._,"He thought, poor prodigal! a father yet"
15495,_PLAYERS._,His woes would pity and his crimes forget;
15496,_PLAYERS._,Nor had he brother who with speech severe
15497,_PLAYERS._,Would check the pity or refrain the tear:                          360
15498,_PLAYERS._,"A lighter spirit in his bosom rose,"
15499,_PLAYERS._,As near the road he sought an hour's repose.
15500,_PLAYERS._,"And there he found it: he had left the town,"
15501,_PLAYERS._,But buildings yet were scatter'd up and down;
15502,_PLAYERS._,"To one of these, half-ruin'd and half-built,"
15503,_PLAYERS._,Was traced this child of wretchedness and guilt;
15504,_PLAYERS._,"There on the remnant of a beggar's vest,"
15505,_PLAYERS._,"Thrown by in scorn, the sufferer sought for rest;"
15506,_PLAYERS._,"There was this scene of vice and wo to close,"
15507,_PLAYERS._,And there the wretched body found repose.                          370

15851,_THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES._,The rising storm of fury to allay.
15852,_THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES._,"This might he do, and so in safety sleep,"

15855,_THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES._,By pouring oil of flattery on its rage.

15864,_THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES._,"Nauseous to those who must the dose apply,"
15865,_THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES._,And most disgusting to the standers-by;

15879,_THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES._,His power and purse have back'd the failing laws;
15880,_THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES._,"He for religion has a due respect,"

15882,_THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES._,"Although he pray'd and languished for a son,"
15883,_THE ALMS-HOUSE AND TRUSTEES._,He grew resigned when Heaven denied him one;

15960,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"But, gay and handsome, he had soon the dower"

15992,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"These he enjoy'd, though not in just the style"

15996,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"His lady took the same amusing way,"

16004,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"To vicious pleasure he was still inclined,"
16005,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,But vice must now be season'd and refined;
16006,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"_Then_ as a swine he would on pleasure seize,"
16007,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Now common pleasures had no power to please:
16008,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Beauty alone has for the vulgar charms,"

16010,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"His was no more a youthful dream of joy,"

16012,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"He bought indulgence with a boundless price,"
16013,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Most pleased when decency bow'd down to vice,"
16014,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"When a fair dame her husband's honour sold,"
16015,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,And a frail Countess play'd for Blaney's gold.
16016,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"""But did not conscience in her anger rise?"""
16017,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Yes! and he learn'd her terrors to despise;
16018,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"When stung by thought, to soothing books he fled,"
16019,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,And grew composed and hardened as he read;
16020,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Tales of Voltaire, and essays gay and slight,"
16021,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Pleased him and shone with their phosphoric light;                  80
16022,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Which, though it rose from objects vile and base,"
16023,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Where'er it came threw splendour on the place,"
16024,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And was that light which the deluded youth,"
16025,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And this grey sinner, deem'd the light of truth."
16026,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,He different works for different cause admired--
16027,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Some fix'd his judgment, some his passions fired;"

16031,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"These won to vicious act the yielding heart,                        90"
16032,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,And then the cooler reasoners soothed the smart.
16033,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"He heard of Blount, and Mandeville, and Chubb,"
16034,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,How they the doctors of their day would drub;
16035,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"How Hume had dwelt on miracles so well,"
16036,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,That none would now believe a miracle;
16037,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And though he cared not works so grave to read,"
16038,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,He caught their faith and sign'd the sinner's creed.
16039,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Thus was he pleased to join the laughing side;
16040,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Nor ceased the laughter when his lady died.
16041,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Yet was he kind and careful of her fame,                           100"
16042,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,And on her tomb inscribed a virtuous name:
16043,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"""A tender wife, respected, and so forth.""--"
16044,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,The marble still bears witness to the worth.
16045,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"He has some children, but he knows not where;"
16046,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Something they cost, but neither love nor care;"
16047,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"A father's feelings he has never known,"
16048,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"His joys, his sorrows, have been all his own."
16049,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"He now would build--and lofty seat he built,"
16050,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And sought, in various ways, relief from guilt."
16051,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Restless, for ever anxious to obtain                               110"
16052,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Ease for the heart by ramblings of the brain,"
16053,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"He would have pictures, and of course a taste,"
16054,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,And found a thousand means his wealth to waste.
16055,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Newmarket steeds he bought at mighty cost;
16056,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"They sometimes won, but Blaney always lost."
16057,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Quick came his ruin, came when he had still"
16058,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"For life a relish, and in pleasure skill:"
16059,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,By his own idle reckoning he supposed
16060,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,His wealth would last him till his life was closed;
16061,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"But no! he found his final hoard was spent,                        120"
16062,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,While he had years to suffer and repent.
16063,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Yet at the last, his noble mind to show,"
16064,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And in his misery how he bore the blow,"
16065,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"He view'd his only guinea, then suppress'd"
16066,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"For a short time, the tumults in his breast,"
16067,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And, moved by pride, by habit and despair,"
16068,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Gave it an opera-bird to hum an air.
16069,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Come ye! who live for pleasure, come, behold"
16070,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,A man of pleasure when he's poor and old;
16071,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"When he looks back through life, and cannot find                   130"
16072,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,A single action to relieve his mind;
16073,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"When he looks forward, striving still to keep"
16074,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,A steady prospect of eternal sleep;
16075,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"When not one friend is left, of all the train"
16076,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Whom 'twas his pride and boast to entertain--
16077,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Friends now employ'd from house to house to run
16078,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And say, ""Alas! poor Blaney is undone!""--"

16080,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"By whom he stood as long as he could stand,"
16081,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Who seem'd to him from all deception clear,                        140"
16082,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And who, more strange! might think themselves sincere."
16083,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Lo! now the hero shuffling through the town,"
16084,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,To hunt a dinner and to beg a crown;
16085,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"To tell an idle tale, that boys may smile;"
16086,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,To bear a strumpet's billet-doux a mile;

16092,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,The wildest fashion or the worst excess;
16093,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"To be the grey seducer, and entice"

16099,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Then vindicates the deed, and makes the mind his prey.               }"
16100,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Unhappy man! what pains he takes to state
16101,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,(Proof of his fear!) that all below is fate;                       160
16102,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"That all proceed in one appointed track,"
16103,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Where none can stop, or take their journey back!"
16104,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,Then what is vice or virtue?--Yet he'll rail

16106,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"He reads, to learn the various ills they've done,"
16107,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And calls them vipers, every mother's son."
16108,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"He is the harlot's aid, who wheedling tries"

16123,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"And laugh'd aloud, the sign of shame to hide."
16124,_LIFE OF BLANEY._,"Blaney, no aid in his vile cause to lose,"

16207,_CLELIA._,"Her speech was lively, and with ease express'd,"

16209,_CLELIA._,"If some soft stripling had her keenness felt,"

16255,_CLELIA._,"Yet loved he not those labour'd plans and arts,"
16256,_CLELIA._,"But left the business to the ladies' hearts,"
16257,_CLELIA._,"And, when he found them in a proper train,"
16258,_CLELIA._,He thought all else superfluous and vain.                           60
16259,_CLELIA._,"But in that training he was deeply taught,"

16267,_CLELIA._,To make sure conquest of such gentle heart--
16268,_CLELIA._,Of one so mild and humble; for she saw                              70
16269,_CLELIA._,In Henry's eye a love chastised by awe.
16270,_CLELIA._,"Her thoughts of virtue were not all sublime,"
16271,_CLELIA._,Nor virtuous all her thoughts; 'twas now her time
16272,_CLELIA._,"To bait each hook, in every way to please,"
16273,_CLELIA._,And the rich prize with dext'rous hand to seize.
16274,_CLELIA._,She had no virgin-terrors; she could stray
16275,_CLELIA._,"In all love's maze, nor fear to lose her way;"
16276,_CLELIA._,"Nay, could go near the precipice, nor dread"
16277,_CLELIA._,A failing caution or a giddy head;
16278,_CLELIA._,"She'd fix her eyes upon the roaring flood,                          80"
16279,_CLELIA._,And dance upon the brink where danger stood.
16280,_CLELIA._,"'Twas nature all, she judged, in one so young,"
16281,_CLELIA._,To drop the eye and falter in the tongue;
16282,_CLELIA._,"To be about to take, and then command"
16283,_CLELIA._,"His daring wish, and only view the hand:"
16284,_CLELIA._,Yes! all was nature; it became a maid
16285,_CLELIA._,Of gentle soul t' encourage love afraid.--
16286,_CLELIA._,"He, so unlike the confident and bold,"
16287,_CLELIA._,Would fly in mute despair to find her cold:
16288,_CLELIA._,The young and tender germ requires the sun                          90
16289,_CLELIA._,To make it spread; it must be smiled upon.
16290,_CLELIA._,Thus the kind virgin gentle means devised
16291,_CLELIA._,"To gain a heart so fond, a hand so prized;"
16292,_CLELIA._,More gentle still she grew; to change her way
16293,_CLELIA._,"Would cause confusion, danger and delay:"
16294,_CLELIA._,"Thus, (an increase of gentleness her mode,)"
16295,_CLELIA._,"She took a plain, unvaried, certain road,"
16296,_CLELIA._,"And every hour believed success was near,"
16297,_CLELIA._,Till there was nothing left to hope or fear.
16298,_CLELIA._,"It must be own'd that in this strife of hearts,                  100"
16299,_CLELIA._,Man has advantage--has superior arts.
16300,_CLELIA._,"The lover's aim is to the nymph unknown,"
16301,_CLELIA._,Nor is she always certain of her own;
16302,_CLELIA._,"Or has her fears, nor these can so disguise,                         }"
16303,_CLELIA._,"But he who searches, reads them in her eyes,                         }"

16315,_CLELIA._,"He other [blessing] sought, without the hand;"

16335,_CLELIA._,Would think him rash--and surely she must know.
16336,_CLELIA._,"Then as a matron Clelia taught a school,"

16348,_CLELIA._,"Gaily to dress and in the bar preside,"

16350,_CLELIA._,"But cooking, waiting, welcoming a crew"

16354,_CLELIA._,"And as their spirits wasted in the strife,                         150"
16355,_CLELIA._,Both took the Griffin's ready aid of life;
16356,_CLELIA._,But she with greater prudence--Harry tried

16358,_CLELIA._,"Yet drew down vengeance: in no distant time,"

16469,_BENBOW._,"See yonder badgeman, with that glowing face,"
16470,_BENBOW._,A meteor shining in this sober place!
16471,_BENBOW._,"Vast sums were paid, and many years were past,"
16472,_BENBOW._,Ere gems so rich around their radiance cast!
16473,_BENBOW._,"Such was the fiery front that Bardolph wore,"
16474,_BENBOW._,Guiding his master to the tavern-door;
16475,_BENBOW._,"There first that meteor rose, and there alone,"
16476,_BENBOW._,"In its due place, the rich effulgence shone."
16477,_BENBOW._,"But this strange fire the seat of peace invades,"
16478,_BENBOW._,And shines portentous in these solemn shades.                       10
16479,_BENBOW._,"Benbow, a boon companion, long approved"
16480,_BENBOW._,"By jovial sets, and (as he thought) beloved,"
16481,_BENBOW._,"Was judged as one to joy and friendship prone,"
16482,_BENBOW._,And deem'd injurious to himself alone;
16483,_BENBOW._,"Gen'rous and free, he paid but small regard"
16484,_BENBOW._,"To trade, and fail'd; and some declared ""'twas hard."""
16485,_BENBOW._,These were his friends--his foes conceived the case
16486,_BENBOW._,Of common kind; he sought and found disgrace;
16487,_BENBOW._,"The reasoning few, who neither scorn'd nor loved,"
16488,_BENBOW._,His feelings pitied and his faults reproved.                        20
16489,_BENBOW._,"Benbow, the father, left possessions fair,"
16490,_BENBOW._,A worthy name and business to his heir;
16491,_BENBOW._,"Benbow, the son, those fair possessions sold,"
16492,_BENBOW._,"And lost his credit, while he spent the gold."
16493,_BENBOW._,He was a jovial trader: men enjoy'd
16494,_BENBOW._,The night with him; his day was unemploy'd;
16495,_BENBOW._,"So, when his credit and his cash were spent,"
16496,_BENBOW._,"Here, by mistaken pity, he was sent;"
16497,_BENBOW._,"Of late he came, with passions unsubdued,                            }"
16498,_BENBOW._,"And shared and cursed the hated solitude,                         30 }"
16499,_BENBOW._,"Where gloomy thoughts arise, where grievous cares intrude.           }"
16500,_BENBOW._,"Known but in drink--he found an easy friend,"
16501,_BENBOW._,Well pleased his worth and honour to commend;
16502,_BENBOW._,"And, thus inform'd, the guardian of the trust"
16503,_BENBOW._,Heard the applause and said the claim was just;
16504,_BENBOW._,"A worthy soul! unfitted for the strife,"
16505,_BENBOW._,Care and contention of a busy life;--
16506,_BENBOW._,"Worthy, and why?--that o'er the midnight bowl"
16507,_BENBOW._,"He made his friend the partner of his soul,"
16508,_BENBOW._,"And any man his friend;--then thus in glee,                         40"
16509,_BENBOW._,"""I speak my mind; I love the truth,"" quoth he;"
16510,_BENBOW._,"Till 'twas his fate that useful truth to find,"
16511,_BENBOW._,'Tis sometimes prudent not to speak the mind.
16512,_BENBOW._,"With wine inflated, man is all upblown,"
16513,_BENBOW._,And feels a power which he believes his own;
16514,_BENBOW._,"With fancy soaring to the skies, he thinks"
16515,_BENBOW._,His all the virtues all the while he drinks;
16516,_BENBOW._,"But when the gas from the balloon is gone,"
16517,_BENBOW._,"When sober thoughts and serious cares come on,"
16518,_BENBOW._,Where then the worth that in himself he found?--                    50
16519,_BENBOW._,Vanish'd--and he sank grov'ling on the ground.
16520,_BENBOW._,Still some conceit will Benbow's mind inflate;                     }
16521,_BENBOW._,Poor as he is--'tis pleasant to relate                               }
16522,_BENBOW._,The joys he once possess'd: it soothes his present state.            }
16523,_BENBOW._,"Seated with some grey beadsman, he regrets"
16524,_BENBOW._,"His former feasting, though it swell'd his debts;"
16525,_BENBOW._,"Topers once famed, his friends in earlier days,"
16526,_BENBOW._,"Well he describes, and thinks description praise:"
16527,_BENBOW._,Each hero's worth with much delight he paints;
16528,_BENBOW._,"Martyrs they were, and he would make them saints.                   60"
16529,_BENBOW._,"""Alas! alas!"" Old England now may say,"
16530,_BENBOW._,"""My glory withers; it has had its day:"
16531,_BENBOW._,We're fallen on evil times; men read and think;
16532,_BENBOW._,Our bold forefathers loved to fight and drink.
16533,_BENBOW._,"""Then lived the good 'Squire Asgill--what a change"
16534,_BENBOW._,Has death and fashion shown us at the Grange!
16535,_BENBOW._,"He bravely thought it best became his rank,"
16536,_BENBOW._,That all his tenants and his tradesmen drank;
16537,_BENBOW._,He was delighted from his favourite room
16538,_BENBOW._,"To see them 'cross the park go daily home,                          70"
16539,_BENBOW._,"Praising aloud the liquor and the host,"
16540,_BENBOW._,And striving who should venerate him most.
16541,_BENBOW._,"""No pride had he, and there was difference small                   }"
16542,_BENBOW._,Between the master's and the servants' hall;                         }
16543,_BENBOW._,And here or there the guests were welcome all.                       }
16544,_BENBOW._,Of Heaven's free gifts he took no special care;
16545,_BENBOW._,He never quarrel'd for a simple hare;
16546,_BENBOW._,"But sought, by giving sport, a sportsman's name,"
16547,_BENBOW._,"Himself a poacher, though at other game."
16548,_BENBOW._,He never planted nor inclosed--his trees                            80
16549,_BENBOW._,"Grew like himself, untroubled and at ease;"
16550,_BENBOW._,"Bounds of all kinds he hated, and had felt"
16551,_BENBOW._,"Choked and imprison'd in a modern belt,"
16552,_BENBOW._,Which some rare genius now has twined about
16553,_BENBOW._,"The good old house, to keep old neighbours out;"
16554,_BENBOW._,"Along his valleys, in the evening hours,"
16555,_BENBOW._,"The borough-damsels stray'd to gather flowers,"
16556,_BENBOW._,"Or by the brakes and brushwood of the park,"
16557,_BENBOW._,To take their pleasant rambles in the dark.
16558,_BENBOW._,"""Some prudes, of rigid kind, forbore to call                      90"
16559,_BENBOW._,On the kind females--favourites at the hall;
16560,_BENBOW._,"But better natures saw, with much delight,"
16561,_BENBOW._,The different orders of mankind unite;
16562,_BENBOW._,"'Twas schooling pride to see the footman wait,"
16563,_BENBOW._,Smile on his sister and receive her plate.
16564,_BENBOW._,"""His worship ever was a churchman true,"
16565,_BENBOW._,He held in scorn the methodistic crew;
16566,_BENBOW._,"'May God defend the Church, and save the King,'"
16567,_BENBOW._,He'd pray devoutly and divinely sing.
16568,_BENBOW._,Admit that he the holy day would spend                             100
16569,_BENBOW._,As priests approved not--still he was a friend.
16570,_BENBOW._,"Much then I blame the preacher, as too nice,"
16571,_BENBOW._,"To call such trifles by the name of vice,"
16572,_BENBOW._,"Hinting, though gently and with cautious speech,"
16573,_BENBOW._,Of good example--'tis their trade to preach;
16574,_BENBOW._,"But still 'twas pity, when the worthy 'squire"
16575,_BENBOW._,Stuck to the church: what more could they require?
16576,_BENBOW._,"'Twas almost joining that fanatic crew,"
16577,_BENBOW._,To throw such morals at his honour's pew;
16578,_BENBOW._,"A weaker man, had he been so reviled,                              110"
16579,_BENBOW._,Had left the place--he only swore and smiled.
16580,_BENBOW._,"""But think, ye rectors and ye curates, think,"
16581,_BENBOW._,"Who are your friends, and at their frailties wink;"
16582,_BENBOW._,"Conceive not--mounted on your Sunday-throne,"
16583,_BENBOW._,Your fire-brands fall upon your foes alone;
16584,_BENBOW._,"They strike your patrons--and, should all withdraw"
16585,_BENBOW._,"In whom your wisdoms may discern a flaw,"
16586,_BENBOW._,"You would the flower of all your audience lose,"
16587,_BENBOW._,"And spend your crackers on their empty pews,"
16588,_BENBOW._,"""The father dead, the son has found a wife,                      120"
16589,_BENBOW._,"And lives a formal, proud, unsocial life;--"
16590,_BENBOW._,"The lands are now enclosed; the tenants all,"
16591,_BENBOW._,"Save at a rent-day, never see the hall;"
16592,_BENBOW._,"No lass is suffer'd o'er the walks to come,"
16593,_BENBOW._,"And, if there's love, they have it all at home."
16594,_BENBOW._,"""Oh! could the ghost of our good 'squire arise,"
16595,_BENBOW._,"And see such change, would it believe its eyes?"
16596,_BENBOW._,"Would it not glide about from place to place,"
16597,_BENBOW._,And mourn the manners of a feebler race?
16598,_BENBOW._,"At that long table, where the servants found                       130"
16599,_BENBOW._,Mirth and abundance while the year went round;
16600,_BENBOW._,Where a huge pollard on the winter-fire
16601,_BENBOW._,At a huge distance made them all retire;
16602,_BENBOW._,"Where not a measure in the room was kept,"
16603,_BENBOW._,And but one rule--they tippled till they slept:
16604,_BENBOW._,"There would it see a pale old hag preside,"
16605,_BENBOW._,A thing made up of stinginess and pride;
16606,_BENBOW._,"Who carves the meat, as if the flesh could feel,"
16607,_BENBOW._,Careless whose flesh must miss the plenteous meal.
16608,_BENBOW._,"Here would the ghost a small coal-fire behold,                     140"
16609,_BENBOW._,Not fit to keep one body from the cold;
16610,_BENBOW._,"Then would it flit to higher rooms, and stay"
16611,_BENBOW._,"To view a dull, dress'd company at play;"
16612,_BENBOW._,"All the old comfort, all the genial fare"
16613,_BENBOW._,For ever gone! how sternly would it stare;
16614,_BENBOW._,"And, though it might not to their view appear,"
16615,_BENBOW._,'Twould cause among them lassitude and fear;
16616,_BENBOW._,Then wait to see--where he delight has seen--
16617,_BENBOW._,The dire effect of fretfulness and spleen.
16618,_BENBOW._,"""Such were the worthies of these better days;                    150"
16619,_BENBOW._,We had their blessings--they shall have our praise.--
16620,_BENBOW._,"""Of Captain Dowling would you hear me speak?"
16621,_BENBOW._,I'd sit and sing his praises for a week:
16622,_BENBOW._,"He was a man, and man-like all his joy,--"
16623,_BENBOW._,"I'm led to question, was he ever boy?"
16624,_BENBOW._,"Beef was his breakfast;--if from sea and salt,"
16625,_BENBOW._,It relish'd better with his wine of malt;
16626,_BENBOW._,"Then, till he dined, if walking in or out,"
16627,_BENBOW._,"Whether the gravel teased him or the gout,"
16628,_BENBOW._,"Though short in wind and flannel'd every limb,                     160"
16629,_BENBOW._,He drank with all who had concerns with him:
16630,_BENBOW._,"Whatever trader, agent, merchant, came,"
16631,_BENBOW._,"They found him ready, every hour the same;"
16632,_BENBOW._,"Whatever liquors might between them pass,"
16633,_BENBOW._,"He took them all, and never balk'd his glass;"
16634,_BENBOW._,"Nay, with the seamen working in the ship,"
16635,_BENBOW._,"At their request, he'd share the grog and flip."
16636,_BENBOW._,"But in the club-room was his chief delight,"
16637,_BENBOW._,And punch the favourite liquor of the night;
16638,_BENBOW._,"Man after man they from the trial shrank,                          170"
16639,_BENBOW._,And Dowling ever was the last who drank.
16640,_BENBOW._,"Arrived at home, he, ere he sought his bed,"
16641,_BENBOW._,With pipe and brandy would compose his head;
16642,_BENBOW._,"Then half an hour was o'er the news beguiled,"
16643,_BENBOW._,When he retired as harmless as a child.
16644,_BENBOW._,"Set but aside the gravel and the gout,"
16645,_BENBOW._,And breathing short--his sand ran fairly out.
16646,_BENBOW._,"""At fifty-five we lost him--after that"
16647,_BENBOW._,Life grows insipid and its pleasures flat;
16648,_BENBOW._,"He had indulged in all that man can have,                          180"
16649,_BENBOW._,He did not drop a dotard to his grave;
16650,_BENBOW._,"Still to the last, his feet upon the chair,"
16651,_BENBOW._,With rattling lungs now gone beyond repair;
16652,_BENBOW._,"When on each feature death had fix'd his stamp,"
16653,_BENBOW._,And not a doctor could the body vamp;
16654,_BENBOW._,"Still at the last, to his beloved bowl"
16655,_BENBOW._,"He clung, and cheer'd the sadness of his soul;"
16656,_BENBOW._,"For, though a man may not have much to fear,"
16657,_BENBOW._,"Yet death looks ugly, when the view is near."
16658,_BENBOW._,"--'I go,' he said, 'but still my friends shall say,                190"
16659,_BENBOW._,'Twas as a man--I did not sneak away;
16660,_BENBOW._,An honest life with worthy souls I've spent--
16661,_BENBOW._,"Come, fill my glass;'--he took it, and he went.--"
16662,_BENBOW._,"""Poor Dolly Murrey!--I might live to see"
16663,_BENBOW._,"My hundredth year, but no such lass as she."
16664,_BENBOW._,"Easy by nature, in her humour gay,"
16665,_BENBOW._,"She chose her comforts, ratafia and play:"
16666,_BENBOW._,"She loved the social game, the decent glass;"
16667,_BENBOW._,"And was a jovial, friendly, laughing lass."
16668,_BENBOW._,"We sat not then at Whist demure and still,                         200"
16669,_BENBOW._,But pass'd the pleasant hours at gay Quadrille;
16670,_BENBOW._,"Lame in her side, we placed her in her seat,"
16671,_BENBOW._,"Her hands were free, she cared not for her feet;"
16672,_BENBOW._,"As the game ended, came the glass around,"
16673,_BENBOW._,"(So was the loser cheer'd, the winner crown'd.)"
16674,_BENBOW._,"Mistress of secrets, both the young and old"
16675,_BENBOW._,In her confided--not a tale she told;
16676,_BENBOW._,"Love never made impression on her mind,"
16677,_BENBOW._,"She held him weak, and all his captives blind;"
16678,_BENBOW._,"She suffered no man her free soul to vex,                          210"
16679,_BENBOW._,Free from the weakness of her gentle sex;
16680,_BENBOW._,"One with whom ours unmoved conversing sate,"
16681,_BENBOW._,In cool discussion or in free debate.
16682,_BENBOW._,"""Once in her chair we'd placed the good old lass,"
16683,_BENBOW._,Where first she took her preparation glass;
16684,_BENBOW._,"By lucky thought she'd been that day at prayers,"
16685,_BENBOW._,And long before had fix'd her small affairs;
16686,_BENBOW._,So all was easy--on her cards she cast
16687,_BENBOW._,A smiling look; I saw the thought that pass'd:
16688,_BENBOW._,"'A king,' she call'd;--though conscious of her skill,              220"
16689,_BENBOW._,"'Do more,' I answer'd--'More?' she said; 'I will;'"
16690,_BENBOW._,"And more she did--cards answer'd to her call,"
16691,_BENBOW._,She saw the mighty to her mightier fall:
16692,_BENBOW._,"'A vole! a vole!' she cried, ''tis fairly won,"
16693,_BENBOW._,My game is ended and my work is done.'--
16694,_BENBOW._,"This said, she gently, with a single sigh,"
16695,_BENBOW._,Died as one taught and practised how to die.
16696,_BENBOW._,"""Such were the dead-departed; I survive,"
16697,_BENBOW._,"To breathe in pain among the dead-alive."""
16698,_BENBOW._,The bell then call'd these ancient men to pray;                230 }
16699,_BENBOW._,"""Again!"" said Benbow--""tolls it every day?                           }"
16700,_BENBOW._,"Where is the life I led?""--He sigh'd, and walk'd his way.            }"

17555,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,_THE PARISH-CLERK._
17556,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,
17557,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"With our late vicar, and his age the same,                           }"
17558,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"His clerk, hight Jachin, to his office came:                         }"
17559,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The like slow speech was his, the like tall slender frame.           }"
17560,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"But Jachin was the gravest man on ground,"
17561,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And heard his master's jokes with look profound;
17562,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"For worldly wealth this man of letters sigh'd,"
17563,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And had a sprinkling of the spirit's pride;
17564,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"But he was sober, chaste, devout, and just,"
17565,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,One whom his neighbours could believe and trust:
17566,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Of none suspected, neither man nor maid                             10"
17567,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"By him were wrong'd, or were of him afraid."
17568,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"There was indeed a frown, a trick of state"
17569,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,In Jachin;--formal was his air and gait;
17570,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,But if he seem'd more solemn and less kind
17571,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Than some light men to light affairs confined,"
17572,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Still 'twas allow'd that he should so behave
17573,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"As in high seat, and be severely grave."
17574,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,This book-taught man to man's first foe profess'd
17575,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Defiance stern, and hate that knew not rest;"
17576,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"He held that Satan, since the world began,                          20"
17577,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,In every act had strife with every man;
17578,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"That never evil deed on earth was done,"
17579,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,But of the acting parties he was one:
17580,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,The flattering guide to make ill prospers clear;
17581,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,To smooth rough ways the constant pioneer;
17582,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The ever-tempting, soothing, softening power,"
17583,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Ready to cheat, seduce, deceive, devour."
17584,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""Me has the sly seducer oft withstood,"""
17585,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Said pious Jachin,--""but he gets no good;"
17586,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"I pass the house where swings the tempting sign,                    30"
17587,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And, pointing, tell him, 'Satan, that is thine;'"
17588,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"I pass the damsels pacing down the street,"
17589,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And look more grave and solemn when we meet;
17590,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Nor doth it irk me to rebuke their smiles,"
17591,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Their wanton ambling and their watchful wiles.
17592,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Nay, like the good John Bunyan, when I view"
17593,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Those forms, I'm angry at the ills they do;"
17594,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"That I could pinch and spoil, in sin's despite,"
17595,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Beauties, which frail and evil thoughts excite[66]!"
17596,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""At feasts and banquets seldom am I found,                        40"
17597,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And (save at church) abhor a tuneful sound;
17598,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"To plays and shows I run not to and fro,"
17599,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And where my master goes forbear to go."""
17600,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"No wonder Satan took the thing amiss,"
17601,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,To be opposed by such a man as this--
17602,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"A man so grave, important, cautious, wise,"
17603,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Who dared not trust his feeling or his eyes;
17604,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"No wonder he should lurk and lie in wait,"
17605,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Should fit his hooks and ponder on his bait;
17606,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Should on his movements keep a watchful eye;                        50
17607,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,For he pursued a fish who led the fry.
17608,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,With his own peace our clerk was not content;
17609,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"He tried, good man! to make his friends repent."
17610,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""Nay, nay, my friends, from inns and taverns fly;"
17611,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"You may suppress your thirst, but not supply."
17612,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"A foolish proverb says, 'the devil's at home;'"
17613,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"But he is there, and tempts in every room:"
17614,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Men feel, they know not why, such places please;"
17615,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,His are the spells--they're idleness and ease;
17616,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Magic of fatal kind he throws around,                               60"
17617,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Where care is banish'd but the heart is bound.
17618,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""Think not of beauty; when a maid you meet,"
17619,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Turn from her view, and step across the street;"
17620,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Dread all the sex: their looks create a charm,"
17621,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,A smile should fright you and a word alarm.
17622,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"E'en I myself, with all my watchful care,                            }"
17623,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Have for an instant felt th' insidious snare,                        }"
17624,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And caught my sinful eyes at th' endangering stare;                  }
17625,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Till I was forced to smite my bounding breast
17626,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,With forceful blow and bid the bold-one rest.                       70
17627,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""Go not with crowds when they to pleasure run,"
17628,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,But public joy in private safety shun.
17629,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"When bells, diverted from their true intent,                         }"
17630,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Ring loud for some deluded mortal sent                               }
17631,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,To hear or make long speech in parliament;                           }
17632,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"What time the many, that unruly beast,"
17633,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Roars its rough joy and shares the final feast:
17634,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Then heed my counsel, shut thine ears and eyes;"
17635,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"A few will hear me--for the few are wise."""
17636,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Not Satan's friends, nor Satan's self could bear                  80"
17637,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,The cautious man who took of souls such care:
17638,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"An interloper--one who, out of place,"
17639,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Had volunteer'd upon the side of grace.
17640,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,There was his master ready once a week
17641,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,To give advice; what further need he seek?
17642,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""Amen, so be it:""--what had he to do"
17643,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,With more than this?--'twas insolent and new;
17644,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And some determined on a way to see
17645,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"How frail he was, that so it might not be."
17646,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"First they essay'd to tempt our saint to sin,                     90"
17647,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,By points of doctrine argued at an inn;
17648,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Where he might warmly reason, deeply drink,"
17649,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Then lose all power to argue and to think.
17650,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"In vain they tried; he took the question up,"
17651,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Clear'd every doubt, and barely touch'd the cup;"
17652,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"By many a text he proved his doctrine sound,"
17653,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And look'd in triumph on the tempters round.
17654,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Next 'twas their care an artful lass to find,"
17655,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Who might consult him, as perplex'd in mind;"
17656,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"She, they conceived, might put her case with fears,                100"
17657,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,With tender tremblings and seducing tears;
17658,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"She might such charms of various kind display,"
17659,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,That he would feel their force and melt away:
17660,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"For why of nymphs such caution and such dread,"
17661,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Unless he felt and fear'd to be misled?
17662,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"She came, she spake: he calmly heard her case,"
17663,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And plainly told her 'twas a want of grace;
17664,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Bade her ""such fancies and affections check,"
17665,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And wear a thicker muslin on her neck."""
17666,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Abased, his human foes the combat fled,                            110"
17667,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And the stern clerk yet higher held his head.
17668,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"They were indeed a weak, impatient set;"
17669,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,But their shrewd prompter had his engines yet;
17670,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Had various means to make a mortal trip,"
17671,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Who shunn'd a flowing bowl and rosy lip;
17672,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And knew a thousand ways his heart to move,"
17673,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Who flies from banquets and who laughs at love.
17674,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Thus far the playful Muse has lent her aid,"
17675,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"But now departs, of graver theme afraid;"
17676,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Her may we seek in more appropriate time--                         120
17677,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,There is no jesting with distress and crime.
17678,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Our worthy clerk had now arrived at fame,"
17679,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Such as but few in his degree might claim;
17680,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"But he was poor, and wanted not the sense"
17681,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,That lowly rates the praise without the pence:
17682,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,He saw the common herd with reverence treat
17683,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,The weakest burgess whom they chanced to meet;
17684,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"While few respected his exalted views,"
17685,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And all beheld his doublet and his shoes;
17686,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"None, when they meet, would to his parts allow                     130"
17687,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,(Save his poor boys) a hearing or a bow.
17688,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,To this false judgment of the vulgar mind
17689,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"He was not fully, as a saint, resign'd;"
17690,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"He found it much his jealous soul affect,"
17691,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,To fear derision and to find neglect.
17692,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The year was bad, the christening-fees were small,"
17693,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The weddings few, the parties paupers all:"
17694,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Desire of gain, with fear of want combined,"
17695,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Raised sad commotion in his wounded mind;
17696,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Wealth was in all his thoughts, his views, his dreams,             140"
17697,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And prompted base desires and baseless schemes.
17698,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Alas! how often erring mortals keep
17699,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,The strongest watch against the foes who sleep;
17700,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"While the more wakeful, bold and artful foe"
17701,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Is suffer'd guardless and unmark'd to go.
17702,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Once in a month the sacramental bread
17703,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Our clerk with wine upon the table spread;
17704,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The custom this, that, as the vicar reads,"
17705,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,He for our off'rings round the church proceeds.
17706,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Tall, spacious seats the wealthier people hid,                     150"
17707,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And none had view of what his neighbour did;
17708,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Laid on the box and mingled when they fell,"
17709,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Who should the worth of each oblation tell?
17710,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Now as poor Jachin took the usual round,"
17711,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And saw the alms and heard the metal sound,"
17712,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,He had a thought;--at first it was no more
17713,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Than--""these have cash and give it to the poor."""
17714,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,A second thought from this to work began--
17715,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""And can they give it to a poorer man?"""
17716,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Proceeding thus--""My merit could they know,                        160"
17717,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And knew my need, how freely they'd bestow;"
17718,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"But though they know not, these remain the same;"
17719,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And are a strong, although a secret claim:"
17720,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"To me, alas! the want and worth are known;--"
17721,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Why then, in fact, 'tis but to take my own."""
17722,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Thought after thought pour'd in, a tempting train--"
17723,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""Suppose it done, who is it could complain?"
17724,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,How could the poor? for they such trifles share
17725,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"As add no comfort, as suppress no care;"
17726,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,But many a pittance makes a worthy heap--                          170
17727,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,What says the law? that silence puts to sleep;--
17728,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Nought then forbids, the danger could we shun;"
17729,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And sure the business may be safely done.
17730,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""But am I earnest?--earnest? No.--I say,"
17731,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"If such my mind, that I could plan a way;"
17732,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Let me reflect;--I've not allow'd me time
17733,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"To purse the pieces, and if dropp'd they'd chime."""
17734,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Fertile is evil in the soul of man--
17735,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"He paused--said Jachin, ""They may drop on bran."
17736,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Why then 'tis safe and (all consider'd) just;                      180
17737,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,The poor receive it--'tis no breach of trust;
17738,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The old and widows may their trifles miss,"
17739,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,There must be evil in a good like this.
17740,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"But I'll be kind--the sick I'll visit twice,"
17741,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"When now but once, and freely give advice."
17742,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Yet let me think again,""--Again he tried"
17743,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,For stronger reasons on his passion's side;
17744,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And quickly these were found, yet slowly he complied."
17745,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,The morning came: the common service done--
17746,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Shut every door--the solemn rite begun;                            190
17747,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And, as the priest the sacred sayings read,"
17748,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The clerk went forward, trembling as he tread;"
17749,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"O'er the tall pew he held the box, and heard"
17750,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The offer'd piece, rejoicing as he fear'd."
17751,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Just by the pillar, as he cautious tripp'd,"
17752,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And turn'd the aile, he then a portion slipp'd"
17753,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"From the full store, and to the pocket sent,"
17754,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,But held a moment--and then down it went.
17755,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The priest read on; on walk'd the man afraid,"
17756,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Till a gold offering in the plate was laid;                        200
17757,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Trembling he took it, for a moment stopp'd,"
17758,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Then down it fell, and sounded as it dropp'd;"
17759,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Amazed he started, for th' affrighted man,"
17760,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Lost and bewildered, thought not of the bran;"
17761,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"But all were silent, all on things intent"
17762,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Of high concern; none ear to money lent;
17763,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"So on he walk'd, more cautious than before,"
17764,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And gain'd the purposed sum, and one piece more."
17765,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"_Practice makes perfect_;--when the month came round,"
17766,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"He dropp'd the cash, nor listen'd for a sound;                     210"
17767,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"But yet, when, last of all th' assembled flock,"
17768,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,He ate and drank--it gave th' electric shock.
17769,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Oft was he forced his reasons to repeat,"
17770,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Ere he could kneel in quiet at his seat;
17771,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,But custom soothed him.--Ere a single year
17772,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,All this was done without restraint or fear:
17773,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Cool and collected, easy and composed,"
17774,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,He was correct till all the service closed;
17775,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Then to his home, without a groan or sigh,"
17776,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Gravely he went, and laid his treasure by.                         220"
17777,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Want will complain: some widows had express'd
17778,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,A doubt if they were favour'd like the rest;
17779,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The rest described with like regret their dole,"
17780,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And thus from parts they reason'd to the whole;
17781,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"When all agreed some evil must be done,"
17782,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Or rich men's hearts grew harder than a stone.
17783,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Our easy vicar cut the matter short;
17784,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,He would not listen to such vile report.
17785,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,All were not thus--there govern'd in that year                     }
17786,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"A stern stout churl, an angry overseer;                          230 }"
17787,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"A tyrant fond of power, loud, lewd, and most severe.                 }"
17788,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Him the mild vicar, him the graver clerk,"
17789,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Advised, reproved, but nothing would he mark,"
17790,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Save the disgrace; ""and that, my friends,"" said he,"
17791,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""Will I avenge, whenever time may be."""
17792,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"And now, alas! 'twas time;--from man to man"
17793,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Doubt and alarm and shrewd suspicions ran.
17794,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"With angry spirit and with sly intent,"
17795,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,This parish ruler to the altar went;
17796,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"A private mark he fix'd on shillings three,                        240"
17797,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,And but one mark could in the money see;
17798,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"Besides, in peering round, he chanced to note"
17799,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,A sprinkling slight on Jachin's Sunday-coat.
17800,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"All doubt was over:--when the flock were bless'd,"
17801,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"In wrath he rose, and thus his mind express'd,"
17802,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"""Foul deeds are here!"" and, saying this, he took"
17803,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"The clerk, whose conscience, in her cold-fit, shook."
17804,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,His pocket then was emptied on the place;
17805,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,All saw his guilt; all witness'd his disgrace:
17806,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"He fell, he fainted; not a groan, a look,                          250"
17807,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,Escaped the culprit; 'twas a final stroke--
17808,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,A death-wound never to be heal'd--a fall
17809,_THE PARISH-CLERK._,"That all had witness'd, and amazed were all."

17935,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"To me it seems, their females and their men"

17958,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Want and a father to be shunn'd and fear'd,                         40"
17959,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Without employment, prospect, cot, or cash,"
17960,_ELLEN ORFORD._,That I have judged th' heroic souls were rash.
17961,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Now shifts the scene--the fair, in tower confined,"
17962,_ELLEN ORFORD._,In all things suffers but in change of mind;
17963,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Now woo'd by greatness to a bed of state,"
17964,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Now deeply threaten'd with a dungeon's grate;
17965,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Till, suffering much and being tried enough,"
17966,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"She shines, triumphant maid!--temptation-proof."
17967,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Then was I led to vengeful monks, who mix"
17968,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"With nymphs and swains, and play unpriestly tricks;                 50"
17969,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Then view'd banditti, who in forest wide,"

17975,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And, when the weary world was sunk to rest,"
17976,_ELLEN ORFORD._,I've had such sights as--may not be express'd.
17977,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Lo! that chateau, the western tower decay'd,"
17978,_ELLEN ORFORD._,The peasants shun it--they are all afraid;                          60
17979,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"For there was done a deed!--could walls reveal,"
17980,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Or timbers tell it, how the heart would feel!"
17981,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Most horrid was it:--for, behold, the floor"
17982,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Has stain of blood, and will be clean no more."
17983,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Hark to the winds! which through the wide saloon
17984,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And the long passage send a dismal tune--
17985,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Music that ghosts delight in;--and now heed
17986,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Yon beauteous nymph, who must unmask the deed."
17987,_ELLEN ORFORD._,See! with majestic sweep she swims alone
17988,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Through rooms, all dreary, guided by a groan;                       70"
17989,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Though windows rattle, and though tap'stries shake,"
17990,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And the feet falter every step they take,"
17991,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"'Mid groans and gibing sprights she silent goes,                     }"

17994,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And, having thus adventured, thus endured,"
17995,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Fame, wealth, and lover, are for life secured."
17996,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Much have I fear'd, but am no more afraid,"
17997,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"When some chaste beauty, by some wretch betray'd,"
17998,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Is drawn away with such distracted speed,                           80"
17999,_ELLEN ORFORD._,That she anticipates a dreadful deed;--
18000,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Not so do I.--Let solid walls impound
18001,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The captive fair, and dig a moat around;"
18002,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Let there be brazen locks and bars of steel,"
18003,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And keepers cruel, such as never feel;"
18004,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"With not a single note the purse supply,"
18005,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And when she begs, let men and maids deny;"
18006,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Be windows those from which she dares not fall,"
18007,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And help so distant, 'tis in vain to call;"
18008,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Still means of freedom will some power devise,                      90"
18009,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And from the baffled ruffian snatch his prize.
18010,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"To Northern Wales, in some sequester'd spot,"
18011,_ELLEN ORFORD._,I've followed fair Louisa to her cot;
18012,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Where, then a wretched and deserted bride,"
18013,_ELLEN ORFORD._,The injured fair-one wish'd from man to hide;
18014,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Till by her fond repenting Belville found,"
18015,_ELLEN ORFORD._,By some kind chance--the straying of a hound--
18016,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"He at her feet craved mercy, nor in vain;"
18017,_ELLEN ORFORD._,For the relenting dove flew back again.
18018,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"There's something rapturous in distress, or, oh!               100 }"
18019,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Could Clementina bear her lot of wo?                                 }
18020,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Or what she underwent could maiden undergo?                          }
18021,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The day was fix'd; for so the lover sigh'd,"
18022,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"So knelt and craved, he couldn't be denied;"
18023,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"When, tale most dreadful! every hope adieu--"
18024,_ELLEN ORFORD._,For the fond lover is the brother too:
18025,_ELLEN ORFORD._,All other griefs abate; this monstrous grief
18026,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Has no remission, comfort, or relief;"
18027,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Four ample volumes, through each page disclose--"
18028,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Good Heaven protect us!--only woes on woes;                        110
18029,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Till some strange means afford a sudden view
18030,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Of some vile plot, and every wo adieu![68]"
18031,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Now, should we grant these beauties all endure"
18032,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Severest pangs, they've still the speediest cure,"
18033,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Before one charm be wither'd from the face,                          }"
18034,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Except the bloom, which shall again have place,                      }"
18035,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"In wedlock ends each wish, in triumph all disgrace;                  }"
18036,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And life to come we fairly may suppose
18037,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"One light, bright contrast to these wild dark woes."
18038,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"These let us leave, and at her sorrows look,                     120"
18039,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Too often seen, but seldom in a book;"
18040,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Let her who felt, relate them.--On her chair"
18041,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The heroine sits--in former years the fair,"
18042,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Now aged and poor; but Ellen Orford knows,"
18043,_ELLEN ORFORD._,That we should humbly take what Heav'n bestows.
18044,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""My father died--again my mother wed,"
18045,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And found the comforts of her life were fled;
18046,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Her angry husband, vex'd through half his years"
18047,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"By loss and troubles, fill'd her soul with fears;"
18048,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Their children many, and 'twas my poor place                       130"
18049,_ELLEN ORFORD._,To nurse and wait on all the infant-race;
18050,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Labour and hunger were indeed my part,"
18051,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And should have strengthen'd an erroneous heart.
18052,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Sore was the grief to see him angry come,"
18053,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And, teased with business, make distress at home;"
18054,_ELLEN ORFORD._,The father's fury and the children's cries
18055,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"I soon could bear, but not my mother's sighs;"
18056,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"For she look'd back on comforts, and would say,"
18057,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"'I wrong'd thee, Ellen,' and then turn away."
18058,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Thus for my age's good, my youth was tried,                        140"
18059,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And this my fortune till my mother died.
18060,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""So, amid sorrow much and little cheer--"
18061,_ELLEN ORFORD._,A common case--I pass'd my twentieth year;
18062,_ELLEN ORFORD._,For these are frequent evils; thousands share
18063,_ELLEN ORFORD._,An equal grief--the like domestic care.
18064,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Then in my days of bloom, of health and youth,"
18065,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"One, much above me, vow'd his love and truth."
18066,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"We often met, he dreading to be seen,"
18067,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And much I question'd what such dread might mean;
18068,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Yet I believed him true; my simple heart                           150
18069,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And undirected reason took his part.
18070,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Can he who loves me, whom I love, deceive?                        }"
18071,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Can I such wrong of one so kind believe,                             }"
18072,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Who lives but in my smile, who trembles when I grieve?               }"
18073,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""He dared not marry, but we met to prove"
18074,_ELLEN ORFORD._,What sad encroachments and deceits has love:
18075,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Weak that I was, when he, rebuked, withdrew,"
18076,_ELLEN ORFORD._,I let him see that I was wretched too;
18077,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"When less my caution, I had still the pain"
18078,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Of his or mine own weakness to complain.                           160
18079,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Happy the lovers class'd alike in life,"
18080,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Or happier yet the rich endowing wife;
18081,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"But most aggrieved the fond believing maid,"
18082,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Of her rich lover tenderly afraid.
18083,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"You judge th' event; for grievous was my fate,"
18084,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Painful to feel, and shameful to relate:"
18085,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Ah! sad it was my burthen to sustain,"
18086,_ELLEN ORFORD._,When the least misery was the dread of pain;
18087,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"When I have grieving told him my disgrace,"
18088,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And plainly mark'd indifference in his face.                       170
18089,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Hard! with these fears and terrors to behold"
18090,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The cause of all, the faithless lover cold;"
18091,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Impatient grown at every wish denied,"
18092,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And barely civil, soothed and gratified;"
18093,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Peevish when urged to think of vows so strong,"
18094,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And angry when I spake of crime and wrong.
18095,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""All this I felt, and still the sorrow grew,"
18096,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Because I felt that I deserved it too,"
18097,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And begg'd my infant stranger to forgive
18098,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The mother's shame, which in herself must live.                    180"
18099,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""When known that shame, I, soon expell'd from home,"
18100,_ELLEN ORFORD._,With a frail sister shared a hovel's gloom;
18101,_ELLEN ORFORD._,There barely fed--(what could I more request?)--
18102,_ELLEN ORFORD._,My infant slumberer sleeping at my breast;
18103,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"I from my window saw his blooming bride,"
18104,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And my seducer smiling at her side;
18105,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Hope lived till then; I sank upon the floor,"
18106,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And grief and thought and feeling were no more.
18107,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Although revived, I judged that life would close,"
18108,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And went to rest, to wonder that I rose:                           190"
18109,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"My dreams were dismal; wheresoe'er I stray'd,"
18110,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"I seem'd ashamed, alarm'd, despised, betray'd;"
18111,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Always in grief, in guilt, disgraced, forlorn,"
18112,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Mourning that one so weak, so vile, was born;"
18113,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The earth a desert, tumult in the sea,                               }"
18114,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The birds affrighted fled from tree to tree,                         }"
18115,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Obscured the setting sun, and every thing like me;                   }"
18116,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"But Heav'n had mercy, and my need at length"
18117,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Urged me to labour and renew'd my strength.
18118,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""I strove for patience as a sinner must,                         200"
18119,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Yet felt th' opinion of the world unjust:
18120,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"There was my lover, in his joy, esteem'd,"
18121,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And I, in my distress, as guilty deem'd;"
18122,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Yet sure, not all the guilt and shame belong"
18123,_ELLEN ORFORD._,To her who feels and suffers for the wrong.
18124,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The cheat at play may use the wealth he's won,"
18125,_ELLEN ORFORD._,But is not honour'd for the mischief done;
18126,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The cheat in love may use each villain-art,"
18127,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And boast the deed that breaks the victim's heart.
18128,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Four years were past; I might again have found                  210"
18129,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Some erring wish, but for another wound:"
18130,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Lovely my daughter grew, her face was fair;"
18131,_ELLEN ORFORD._,But no expression ever brighten'd there.
18132,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"I doubted long, and vainly strove to make"
18133,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Some certain meaning of the words she spake;
18134,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"But meaning there was none, and I survey'd"
18135,_ELLEN ORFORD._,With dread the beauties of my idiot-maid.
18136,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Still I submitted;--Oh! 'tis meet and fit"
18137,_ELLEN ORFORD._,In all we feel to make the heart submit;
18138,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Gloomy and calm my days, but I had then,                           220"
18139,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"It seem'd, attractions for the eyes of men."
18140,_ELLEN ORFORD._,The sober master of a decent trade
18141,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"O'erlook'd my errors, and his offer made;"
18142,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Reason assented;--true, my heart denied,"
18143,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"'But thou,' I said, 'shalt be no more my guide.'"
18144,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""When wed, our toil and trouble, pains and care,"
18145,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Of means to live procured us humble share;
18146,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Five were our sons,--and we, though careful, found"
18147,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Our hopes declining as the year came round;
18148,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"For I perceived, yet would not soon perceive,                      230"
18149,_ELLEN ORFORD._,My husband stealing from my view to grieve;
18150,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Silent he grew, and when he spoke he sigh'd,"
18151,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And surly look'd and peevishly replied.
18152,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Pensive by nature, he had gone of late"
18153,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"To those who preach'd of destiny and fate,"
18154,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Of things fore-doom'd, and of election-grace,"
18155,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And how in vain we strive to run our race;
18156,_ELLEN ORFORD._,That all by works and moral worth we gain                            }
18157,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Is to perceive our care and labour vain;                             }
18158,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"That still the more we pay, our debts the more remain;           240 }"
18159,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"That he who feels not the mysterious call,"
18160,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Lies bound in sin, still grov'ling from the fall."
18161,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"My husband felt not;--our persuasion, prayer,"
18162,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And our best reason darken'd his despair;
18163,_ELLEN ORFORD._,His very nature changed; he now reviled
18164,_ELLEN ORFORD._,My former conduct--he reproach'd my child;
18165,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"He talk'd of bastard slips, and cursed his bed,"
18166,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And from our kindness to concealment fled;
18167,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"For ever to some evil change inclined,                               }"
18168,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"To every gloomy thought he lent his mind,                        250 }"
18169,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Nor rest would give to us, nor rest himself could find;              }"
18170,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"His son suspended saw him, long bereft"
18171,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Of life, nor prospect of revival left."
18172,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""With him died all our prospects, and once more"
18173,_ELLEN ORFORD._,I shared th' allotments of the parish poor;
18174,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"They took my children too, and this I know"
18175,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Was just and lawful, but I felt the blow;"
18176,_ELLEN ORFORD._,My idiot-maid and one unhealthy boy
18177,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Were left, a mother's misery and her joy."
18178,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Three sons I follow'd to the grave, and one--                   260"
18179,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Oh! can I speak of that unhappy son?
18180,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Would all the memory of that time were fled,"
18181,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And all those horrors, with my child, were dead!"
18182,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Before the world seduced him, what a grace"
18183,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And smile of gladness shone upon his face!
18184,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Then he had knowledge; finely would he write;
18185,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Study to him was pleasure and delight;
18186,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Great was his courage, and but few could stand"
18187,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Against the sleight and vigour of his hand;
18188,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The maidens loved him;--when he came to die,                       270"
18189,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"No, not the coldest could suppress a sigh."
18190,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Here I must cease--how can I say, my child"
18191,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Was by the bad of either sex beguiled?
18192,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Worst of the bad--they taught him that the laws
18193,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Made wrong and right; there was no other cause;
18194,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"That all religion was the trade of priests,"
18195,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And men, when dead, must perish like the beasts;--"
18196,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And he, so lively and so gay before--"
18197,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Ah! spare a mother--I can tell no more.
18198,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Int'rest was made that they should not destroy                  280"
18199,_ELLEN ORFORD._,The comely form of my deluded boy--
18200,_ELLEN ORFORD._,But pardon came not; damp the place and deep
18201,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Where he was kept, as they'd a tiger keep;"
18202,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"For he, unhappy! had before them all"
18203,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Vow'd he'd escape, whatever might befall."
18204,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""He'd means of dress, and dress'd beyond his means,"
18205,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And, so to see him in such dismal scenes,"
18206,_ELLEN ORFORD._,I cannot speak it--cannot bear to tell
18207,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Of that sad hour--I heard the passing-bell!
18208,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Slowly they went; he smiled and look'd so smart,                290"
18209,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Yet sure he shudder'd when he saw the cart,"
18210,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And gave a look--until my dying-day,"
18211,_ELLEN ORFORD._,That look will never from my mind away;
18212,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Oft as I sit, and ever in my dreams,"
18213,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"I see that look, and they have heard my screams."
18214,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Now let me speak no more--yet all declared"
18215,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"That one so young, in pity should be spared,"
18216,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And one so manly;--on his graceful neck,"
18217,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"That chains of jewels may be proud to deck,"
18218,_ELLEN ORFORD._,To a small mole a mother's lips have press'd--                     300
18219,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And there the cord--my breath is sore oppress'd.
18220,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""I now can speak again:--my elder boy"
18221,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Was that year drown'd--a seaman in a hoy.
18222,_ELLEN ORFORD._,He left a numerous race; of these would some
18223,_ELLEN ORFORD._,In their young troubles to my cottage come;
18224,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And these I taught--an humble teacher I--
18225,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Upon their heavenly Parent to rely.
18226,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Alas! I needed such reliance more:--"
18227,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"My idiot-girl, so simply gay before,"
18228,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Now wept in pain; some wretch had found a time,                    310"
18229,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Depraved and wicked, for that coward-crime;"
18230,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"I had indeed my doubt, but I suppress'd"
18231,_ELLEN ORFORD._,The thought that day and night disturb'd my rest;
18232,_ELLEN ORFORD._,She and that sick-pale brother--but why strive
18233,_ELLEN ORFORD._,To keep the terrors of that time alive?
18234,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""The hour arrived, the new, th' undreaded pain,"
18235,_ELLEN ORFORD._,That came with violence and yet came in vain.
18236,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"I saw her die; her brother too is dead,"
18237,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Nor own'd such crime--what is it that I dread?
18238,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""The parish-aid withdrawn, I look'd around,                      320"
18239,_ELLEN ORFORD._,And in my school a bless'd subsistence found--
18240,_ELLEN ORFORD._,My winter-calm of life: to be of use
18241,_ELLEN ORFORD._,Would pleasant thoughts and heavenly hopes produce;
18242,_ELLEN ORFORD._,I loved them all; it soothed me to presage
18243,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"The various trials of their riper age,"
18244,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Then dwell on mine, and bless the Power who gave"
18245,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Pains to correct us, and remorse to save."
18246,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"""Yes! these were days of peace, but they are past--"
18247,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"A trial came, I will believe, a last;"
18248,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"I lost my sight, and my employment gone,                           330"
18249,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Useless I live, but to the day live on;"
18250,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Those eyes, which long the light of heaven enjoy'd,"
18251,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"Were not by pain, by agony destroy'd;"
18252,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"My senses fail not all; I speak, I pray;"
18253,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"By night my rest, my food I take by day;"
18254,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"And as my mind looks cheerful to my end,"
18255,_ELLEN ORFORD._,"I love mankind and call my God my friend."""

18317,_ABEL KEENE._,
18318,_ABEL KEENE._,A quiet simple man was Abel Keene;
18319,_ABEL KEENE._,"He meant no harm, nor did he often mean."
18320,_ABEL KEENE._,"He kept a school of loud rebellious boys,"
18321,_ABEL KEENE._,"And growing old, grew nervous with the noise;"
18322,_ABEL KEENE._,"When a kind merchant hired his useful pen,"
18323,_ABEL KEENE._,And made him happiest of accompting men;
18324,_ABEL KEENE._,"With glee he rose to every easy day,"
18325,_ABEL KEENE._,When half the labour brought him twice the pay.
18326,_ABEL KEENE._,"There were young clerks, and there the merchant's son,"
18327,_ABEL KEENE._,"Choice spirits all, who wish'd him to be one;                       10"
18328,_ABEL KEENE._,"It must, no question, give them lively joy,"
18329,_ABEL KEENE._,"Hopes long indulged, to combat and destroy;"
18330,_ABEL KEENE._,At these they level'd all their skill and strength--
18331,_ABEL KEENE._,"He fell not quickly, but he fell at length."
18332,_ABEL KEENE._,"They quoted books, to him both bold and new,"
18333,_ABEL KEENE._,And scorn'd as fables all he held as true--
18334,_ABEL KEENE._,"""Such monkish stories and such nursery lies,"""
18335,_ABEL KEENE._,That he was struck with terror and surprise.
18336,_ABEL KEENE._,"""What! all his life had he the laws obey'd,"
18337,_ABEL KEENE._,Which they broke through and were not once afraid?                  20
18338,_ABEL KEENE._,"Had he so long his evil passions check'd,"
18339,_ABEL KEENE._,And yet at last had nothing to expect?
18340,_ABEL KEENE._,"While they their lives in joy and pleasure led,"
18341,_ABEL KEENE._,"And then had nothing, at the end, to dread?"
18342,_ABEL KEENE._,"Was all his priest with so much zeal convey'd,"
18343,_ABEL KEENE._,A part! a speech! for which the man was paid?
18344,_ABEL KEENE._,"And were his pious books, his solemn prayers,"
18345,_ABEL KEENE._,Not worth one tale of the admired Voltaire's?
18346,_ABEL KEENE._,"Then was it time, while yet some years remain'd,"
18347,_ABEL KEENE._,"To drink untroubled and to think unchain'd,                         30"
18348,_ABEL KEENE._,"And on all pleasures, which his purse could give,"
18349,_ABEL KEENE._,"Freely to seize, and while he lived, to live."""
18350,_ABEL KEENE._,"Much time he passed in this important strife,"
18351,_ABEL KEENE._,The bliss or bane of his remaining life;
18352,_ABEL KEENE._,"For converts all are made with care and grief,"
18353,_ABEL KEENE._,And pangs attend the birth of unbelief;
18354,_ABEL KEENE._,Nor pass they soon;--with awe and fear he took
18355,_ABEL KEENE._,"The flow'ry way, and cast back many a look."
18356,_ABEL KEENE._,"The youths applauded much his wise design,"
18357,_ABEL KEENE._,With weighty reasoning o'er their evening wine;                     40
18358,_ABEL KEENE._,"And much in private 'twould their mirth improve,"
18359,_ABEL KEENE._,To hear how Abel spake of life and love;
18360,_ABEL KEENE._,"To hear him own what grievous pains it cost,"
18361,_ABEL KEENE._,Ere the old saint was in the sinner lost;
18362,_ABEL KEENE._,"Ere his poor mind with every deed alarm'd,"
18363,_ABEL KEENE._,"By wit was settled, and by vice was charm'd."
18364,_ABEL KEENE._,"For Abel enter'd in his bold career,"
18365,_ABEL KEENE._,"Like boys on ice, with pleasure and with fear;"
18366,_ABEL KEENE._,"Lingering, yet longing for the joy, he went,"
18367,_ABEL KEENE._,"Repenting now, now dreading to repent;                              50"
18368,_ABEL KEENE._,"With awkward pace, and with himself at war,"
18369,_ABEL KEENE._,"Far gone, yet frighten'd that he went so far;"
18370,_ABEL KEENE._,"Oft for his efforts he'd solicit praise,"
18371,_ABEL KEENE._,And then proceed with blunders and delays.
18372,_ABEL KEENE._,"The young more aptly passion's calls pursue,                         }"
18373,_ABEL KEENE._,"But age and weakness start at scenes so new,                         }"
18374,_ABEL KEENE._,"And tremble when they've done, for all they dared to do.             }"
18375,_ABEL KEENE._,At length example Abel's dread removed;
18376,_ABEL KEENE._,With small concern he sought the joys he loved;
18377,_ABEL KEENE._,"Not resting here, he claim'd his share of fame,                     60"
18378,_ABEL KEENE._,"And first their votary, then their wit became;"
18379,_ABEL KEENE._,"His jest was bitter and his satire bold,"
18380,_ABEL KEENE._,"When he his tales of formal brethren told,"
18381,_ABEL KEENE._,"What time with pious neighbours he discuss'd,"
18382,_ABEL KEENE._,Their boasted treasure and their boundless trust:
18383,_ABEL KEENE._,"""Such were our dreams,"" the jovial elder cried;"
18384,_ABEL KEENE._,"""Awake and live,"" his youthful friends replied."
18385,_ABEL KEENE._,"Now the gay clerk a modest drab despised,"
18386,_ABEL KEENE._,And clad him smartly as his friends advised;
18387,_ABEL KEENE._,"So fine a coat upon his back he threw,                              70"
18388,_ABEL KEENE._,That not an alley-boy old Abel knew;
18389,_ABEL KEENE._,"Broad polish'd buttons blazed that coat upon,"
18390,_ABEL KEENE._,And just beneath the watch's trinkets shone--
18391,_ABEL KEENE._,"A splendid watch, that pointed out the time,"
18392,_ABEL KEENE._,To fly from business and make free with crime.
18393,_ABEL KEENE._,The crimson waistcoat and the silken hose
18394,_ABEL KEENE._,Rank'd the lean man among the Borough beaux;
18395,_ABEL KEENE._,"His raven hair he cropp'd with fierce disdain,"
18396,_ABEL KEENE._,And light elastic locks encased his brain:
18397,_ABEL KEENE._,"More pliant pupil who could hope to find,                           80"
18398,_ABEL KEENE._,So deck'd in person and so changed in mind?
18399,_ABEL KEENE._,"When Abel walk'd the streets, with pleasant mien"

18408,_ABEL KEENE._,Nor stretch my feeble hand to stop thy headlong race?                }
18409,_ABEL KEENE._,"Lo! thou art bound; a slave in Satan's chain,"
18410,_ABEL KEENE._,The righteous Abel turn'd the wretched Cain;
18411,_ABEL KEENE._,His brother's blood against the murderer cried;
18412,_ABEL KEENE._,"Against thee thine, unhappy suicide!"
18413,_ABEL KEENE._,"Are all our pious nights and peaceful days,"
18414,_ABEL KEENE._,"Our evening readings and our morning praise,"
18415,_ABEL KEENE._,"Our spirits' comfort in the trials sent,"
18416,_ABEL KEENE._,"Our hearts' rejoicings in the blessings lent,"
18417,_ABEL KEENE._,All that o'er grief a cheering influence shed--                    100

18419,_ABEL KEENE._,"""When in the years gone by, the trying years,"
18420,_ABEL KEENE._,"When faith and hope had strife with wants and fears,"
18421,_ABEL KEENE._,Thy nerves have trembled till thou couldst not eat
18422,_ABEL KEENE._,(Dress'd by this hand) thy mess of simple meat;
18423,_ABEL KEENE._,"When, grieved by fastings, gall'd by fates severe,"
18424,_ABEL KEENE._,Slow pass'd the days of the successless year;
18425,_ABEL KEENE._,"Still in these gloomy hours, my brother then"
18426,_ABEL KEENE._,"Had glorious views, unseen by prosperous men:"
18427,_ABEL KEENE._,"And when thy heart has felt its wish denied,                       110"
18428,_ABEL KEENE._,What gracious texts hast thou to grief applied;
18429,_ABEL KEENE._,"Till thou hast enter'd in thine humble bed,"
18430,_ABEL KEENE._,By lofty hopes and heavenly musings fed;
18431,_ABEL KEENE._,Then I have seen thy lively looks express
18432,_ABEL KEENE._,The spirit's comforts in the man's distress.
18433,_ABEL KEENE._,"""Then didst thou cry, exulting, 'Yes, 'tis fit,"

18436,_ABEL KEENE._,Against such triumphs?--Oh! repent and pray.
18437,_ABEL KEENE._,"""What are thy pleasures?--with the gay to sit,                   120"
18438,_ABEL KEENE._,And thy poor brain torment for awkward wit;
18439,_ABEL KEENE._,"All thy good thoughts (thou hat'st them) to restrain,"
18440,_ABEL KEENE._,And give a wicked pleasure to the vain;
18441,_ABEL KEENE._,"Thy long lean frame by fashion to attire,"
18442,_ABEL KEENE._,That lads may laugh and wantons may admire;
18443,_ABEL KEENE._,"To raise the mirth of boys, and not to see,"
18444,_ABEL KEENE._,Unhappy maniac! that they laugh at thee.
18445,_ABEL KEENE._,"""These boyish follies, which alone the boy"
18446,_ABEL KEENE._,"Can idly act or gracefully enjoy,"
18447,_ABEL KEENE._,"Add new reproaches to thy fallen state,                            130"
18448,_ABEL KEENE._,And make men scorn what they would only hate.
18449,_ABEL KEENE._,"""What pains, my brother, dost thou take to prove"
18450,_ABEL KEENE._,A taste for follies which thou canst not love!
18451,_ABEL KEENE._,Why do thy stiffening limbs the steed bestride--
18452,_ABEL KEENE._,That lads may laugh to see thou canst not ride?
18453,_ABEL KEENE._,And why (I feel the crimson tinge my cheek)
18454,_ABEL KEENE._,Dost thou by night in Diamond-Alley sneak?
18455,_ABEL KEENE._,"""Farewell! the parish will thy sister keep,                        }"

18458,_ABEL KEENE._,"When youth is fall'n, there's hope the young may rise,"
18459,_ABEL KEENE._,But fallen age for ever hopeless lies:
18460,_ABEL KEENE._,"Torn up by storms and placed in earth once more,"
18461,_ABEL KEENE._,The younger tree may sun and soil restore;
18462,_ABEL KEENE._,"But when the old and sapless trunk lies low,"
18463,_ABEL KEENE._,No care or soil can former life bestow;
18464,_ABEL KEENE._,Reserved for burning is the worthless tree;
18465,_ABEL KEENE._,"And what, O Abel! is reserved for thee?"""
18466,_ABEL KEENE._,"These angry words our hero deeply felt,"
18467,_ABEL KEENE._,"Though hard his heart, and indisposed to melt!                     150"
18468,_ABEL KEENE._,"To gain relief he took a glass the more,"
18469,_ABEL KEENE._,"And, then went on as careless as before;"
18470,_ABEL KEENE._,"Thenceforth, uncheck'd, amusements he partook,"
18471,_ABEL KEENE._,And (save his ledger) saw no decent book;
18472,_ABEL KEENE._,"Him found the merchant punctual at his task,"
18473,_ABEL KEENE._,"And, that perform'd, he'd nothing more to ask;"
18474,_ABEL KEENE._,"He cared not how old Abel play'd the fool,"
18475,_ABEL KEENE._,"No master he, beyond the hours of school:"
18476,_ABEL KEENE._,"Thus they, proceeding, had their wine and joke,"
18477,_ABEL KEENE._,"Till merchant Dixon felt a warning stroke,                         160"
18478,_ABEL KEENE._,"And, after struggling half a gloomy week,"
18479,_ABEL KEENE._,Left his poor clerk another friend to seek.
18480,_ABEL KEENE._,"Alas! the son, who led the saint astray,"
18481,_ABEL KEENE._,Forgot the man whose follies made him gay;
18482,_ABEL KEENE._,"He cared no more for Abel in his need,"
18483,_ABEL KEENE._,[Than] Abel cared about his hackney steed;
18484,_ABEL KEENE._,"He now, alas! had all his earnings spent,"
18485,_ABEL KEENE._,And thus was left to languish and repent;
18486,_ABEL KEENE._,"No school nor clerkship found he in the place,"
18487,_ABEL KEENE._,"Now lost to fortune, as before to grace.                           170"
18488,_ABEL KEENE._,"For town-relief the grieving man applied,"
18489,_ABEL KEENE._,And begg'd with tears what some with scorn denied;
18490,_ABEL KEENE._,"Others look'd down upon the glowing vest,"
18491,_ABEL KEENE._,"And, frowning, ask'd him at what price he dress'd?"
18492,_ABEL KEENE._,"Happy for him his country's laws are mild,"
18493,_ABEL KEENE._,"They must support him, though they still reviled;"
18494,_ABEL KEENE._,"Grieved, abject, scorn'd, insulted, and betray'd,"
18495,_ABEL KEENE._,"Of God unmindful, and of man afraid--"
18496,_ABEL KEENE._,"No more he talk'd; 'twas pain, 'twas shame to speak,"
18497,_ABEL KEENE._,His heart was sinking and his frame was weak.                      180
18498,_ABEL KEENE._,"His sister died with such serene delight,"
18499,_ABEL KEENE._,He once again began to think her right;
18500,_ABEL KEENE._,"Poor like himself, the happy spinster lay,"
18501,_ABEL KEENE._,And sweet assurance bless'd her dying-day;
18502,_ABEL KEENE._,"Poor like the spinster, he, when death was nigh,"
18503,_ABEL KEENE._,"Assured of nothing, felt afraid to die."
18504,_ABEL KEENE._,"The cheerful clerks who sometimes pass'd the door,"
18505,_ABEL KEENE._,"Just mention'd ""Abel!"" and then thought no more."
18506,_ABEL KEENE._,"So Abel, pondering on his state forlorn,"
18507,_ABEL KEENE._,"Look'd round for comfort, and was chased by scorn.                 190"
18508,_ABEL KEENE._,"And now we saw him on the beach reclined,"
18509,_ABEL KEENE._,Or causeless walking in the wint'ry wind;
18510,_ABEL KEENE._,"And, when it raised a loud and angry sea,"
18511,_ABEL KEENE._,"He stood and gazed, in wretched reverie;"
18512,_ABEL KEENE._,"He heeded not the frost, the rain, the snow;"
18513,_ABEL KEENE._,Close by the sea he walk'd alone and slow.
18514,_ABEL KEENE._,Sometimes his frame through many an hour he spread
18515,_ABEL KEENE._,"Upon a tombstone, moveless as the dead;"
18516,_ABEL KEENE._,"And, was there found a sad and silent place,"
18517,_ABEL KEENE._,There would he creep with slow and measured pace.                  200
18518,_ABEL KEENE._,"Then would he wander by the river's side,"
18519,_ABEL KEENE._,And fix his eyes upon the falling tide;
18520,_ABEL KEENE._,"The deep dry ditch, the rushes in the fen,"
18521,_ABEL KEENE._,And mossy crag-pits were his lodgings then:
18522,_ABEL KEENE._,"There, to his discontented thoughts a prey,"
18523,_ABEL KEENE._,The melancholy mortal pined away.
18524,_ABEL KEENE._,The neighb'ring poor at length began to speak
18525,_ABEL KEENE._,"Of Abel's ramblings--he'd been gone a week,"
18526,_ABEL KEENE._,They knew not where; and little care they took
18527,_ABEL KEENE._,For one so friendless and so poor to look;                         210
18528,_ABEL KEENE._,"At last a stranger, in a pedler's shed,"
18529,_ABEL KEENE._,Beheld him hanging--he had long been dead.
18530,_ABEL KEENE._,"He left a paper, penn'd at sundry times,"
18531,_ABEL KEENE._,"Intitled thus--""My Groanings and my Crimes!"""
18532,_ABEL KEENE._,"""I was a christian man, and none could lay"
18533,_ABEL KEENE._,Aught to my charge; I walk'd the narrow way:
18534,_ABEL KEENE._,"All then was simple faith, serene and pure,"
18535,_ABEL KEENE._,My hope was steadfast and my prospects sure;
18536,_ABEL KEENE._,"Then was I tried by want and sickness sore,                          }"
18537,_ABEL KEENE._,"But these I clapp'd my shield of faith before,                   220 }"
18538,_ABEL KEENE._,And cares and wants and man's rebukes I bore.                        }
18539,_ABEL KEENE._,"Alas! new foes assail'd me; I was vain,"
18540,_ABEL KEENE._,They stung my pride and they confused my brain:
18541,_ABEL KEENE._,Oh! these deluders! with what glee they saw
18542,_ABEL KEENE._,Their simple dupe transgress the righteous law;
18543,_ABEL KEENE._,"'Twas joy to them to view that dreadful strife,"
18544,_ABEL KEENE._,When faith and frailty warr'd for more than life;
18545,_ABEL KEENE._,"So with their pleasures they beguiled the heart,"
18546,_ABEL KEENE._,Then with their logic they allay'd the smart;
18547,_ABEL KEENE._,"They proved (so thought I then) with reasons strong,               230"
18548,_ABEL KEENE._,That no man's feelings ever led him wrong;
18549,_ABEL KEENE._,"And thus I went, as on the varnish'd ice,"
18550,_ABEL KEENE._,The smooth career of unbelief and vice.
18551,_ABEL KEENE._,"Oft would the youths, with sprightly speech and bold,"
18552,_ABEL KEENE._,Their witty tales of naughty priests unfold;
18553,_ABEL KEENE._,"''Twas all a craft,' they said, 'a cunning trade,"
18554,_ABEL KEENE._,"Not she the priests, but priests religion made:'"
18555,_ABEL KEENE._,"So I believed;""--No, Abel! to thy grief,"

18566,_ABEL KEENE._,"Ah! worse for me--grown poor, I yet remain"
18567,_ABEL KEENE._,"In sinful bonds, and pray and fast in vain.                        250"

18569,_ABEL KEENE._,Have spread their net and caught their prey therein;
18570,_ABEL KEENE._,"Though my hard heart could not for mercy call,"
18571,_ABEL KEENE._,"Because, though great my grief, my faith was small;"
18572,_ABEL KEENE._,"Yet, as the sick on skilful men rely,"
18573,_ABEL KEENE._,The soul diseased may to a doctor fly.
18574,_ABEL KEENE._,"""A famous one there was, whose skill had wrought"

18667,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,"prayer, contrition, fasting, and good works: he shows the evil done"
18668,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,"by reading such books as the Whole Duty of Man, and the Practice of"
18669,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,"Piety; and complains heavily of his relation, an Irish bishop, who"
18670,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,"wanted him to join with the household in family prayer: in fact, the"
18671,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,whole work inculcates that sort of quietism which this dialogue
18672,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,"alludes to, and that without any recommendation of attendance on the"
18673,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,"teachers of the Gospel, but rather holding forth encouragement to"
18674,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,the supineness of man's nature; by the information that he in vain
18675,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,"looks for acceptance by the employment of his talents, and that his"
18676,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,hopes of glory are rather extinguished than raised by any
18677,NOTE TO LETTER XXI.,application to the means of grace.

18732,_PETER GRIMES._,"To town came quiet Peter with his fish,"
18733,_PETER GRIMES._,And had of all a civil word and wish.
18734,_PETER GRIMES._,"He left his trade upon the sabbath-day,"

18740,_PETER GRIMES._,"Yes! then he wept, and to his mind there came"
18741,_PETER GRIMES._,"Much of his conduct, and he felt the shame:--"
18742,_PETER GRIMES._,"How he had oft the good old man reviled,"
18743,_PETER GRIMES._,And never paid the duty of a child;
18744,_PETER GRIMES._,"How, when the father in his Bible read,"
18745,_PETER GRIMES._,He in contempt and anger left the shed;
18746,_PETER GRIMES._,"""It is the word of life,"" the parent cried;"

18749,_PETER GRIMES._,Gave the hot spirit to his boiling blood;--
18750,_PETER GRIMES._,"How he, with oath and furious speech, began"
18751,_PETER GRIMES._,To prove his freedom and assert the man;
18752,_PETER GRIMES._,"And when the parent check'd his impious rage,"
18753,_PETER GRIMES._,How he had cursed the tyranny of age;--
18754,_PETER GRIMES._,"Nay, once had dealt the sacrilegious blow"
18755,_PETER GRIMES._,"On his bare head, and laid his parent low;"
18756,_PETER GRIMES._,"The father groan'd--""If thou art old,"" said he,"

18762,_PETER GRIMES._,"Now lived the youth in freedom, but debarr'd"
18763,_PETER GRIMES._,"From constant pleasure, and he thought it hard;"
18764,_PETER GRIMES._,"Hard that he could not every wish obey,"
18765,_PETER GRIMES._,But must awhile relinquish ale and play;
18766,_PETER GRIMES._,"Hard! that he could not to his cards attend,"
18767,_PETER GRIMES._,But must acquire the money he would spend.
18768,_PETER GRIMES._,With greedy eye he look'd on all he saw;                          40
18769,_PETER GRIMES._,"He knew not justice, and he laugh'd at law;"
18770,_PETER GRIMES._,On all he mark'd he stretch'd his ready hand;
18771,_PETER GRIMES._,"He fish'd by water, and he filch'd by land."
18772,_PETER GRIMES._,"Oft in the night has Peter dropp'd his oar,"
18773,_PETER GRIMES._,Fled from his boat and sought for prey on shore;
18774,_PETER GRIMES._,"Oft up the hedge-row glided, on his back                             }"
18775,_PETER GRIMES._,"Bearing the orchard's produce in a sack,                             }"

18777,_PETER GRIMES._,"And as these wrongs to greater numbers rose,"
18778,_PETER GRIMES._,The more he look'd on all men as his foes.                          50
18779,_PETER GRIMES._,"He built a mud-wall'd hovel, where he kept"
18780,_PETER GRIMES._,"His various wealth, and there he oft-times slept;"
18781,_PETER GRIMES._,"But no success could please his cruel soul,"
18782,_PETER GRIMES._,He wish'd for one to trouble and control;
18783,_PETER GRIMES._,He wanted some obedient boy to stand
18784,_PETER GRIMES._,And bear the blow of his outrageous hand;
18785,_PETER GRIMES._,And hoped to find in some propitious hour
18786,_PETER GRIMES._,A feeling creature subject to his power.
18787,_PETER GRIMES._,Peter had heard there were in London then--
18788,_PETER GRIMES._,"Still have they being!--workhouse-clearing men,                     60"
18789,_PETER GRIMES._,"Who, undisturb'd by feelings just or kind,"
18790,_PETER GRIMES._,Would parish-boys to needy tradesmen bind;
18791,_PETER GRIMES._,"They in their want a trifling sum would take,"
18792,_PETER GRIMES._,And toiling slaves of piteous orphans make.
18793,_PETER GRIMES._,"Such Peter sought, and, when a lad was found,"
18794,_PETER GRIMES._,"The sum was dealt him, and the slave was bound."
18795,_PETER GRIMES._,Some few in town observed in Peter's trap
18796,_PETER GRIMES._,"A boy, with jacket blue and woollen cap;"
18797,_PETER GRIMES._,"But none inquired how Peter used the rope,"
18798,_PETER GRIMES._,"Or what the bruise, that made the stripling stoop;                  70"
18799,_PETER GRIMES._,"None could the ridges on his back behold,"
18800,_PETER GRIMES._,None sought him shiv'ring in the winter's cold;
18801,_PETER GRIMES._,"None put the question--""Peter, dost thou give"
18802,_PETER GRIMES._,"The boy his food?--What, man! the lad must live:"
18803,_PETER GRIMES._,"Consider, Peter, let the child have bread,"
18804,_PETER GRIMES._,"He'll serve thee better if he's stroked and fed."""
18805,_PETER GRIMES._,"None reason'd thus--and some, on hearing cries,"
18806,_PETER GRIMES._,"Said calmly, ""Grimes is at his exercise."""
18807,_PETER GRIMES._,"Pinn'd, beaten, cold, pinch'd, threaten'd, and abused--"
18808,_PETER GRIMES._,His efforts punish'd and his food refused--                         80
18809,_PETER GRIMES._,Awake tormented--soon aroused from sleep--
18810,_PETER GRIMES._,"Struck if he wept, and yet compell'd to weep:"
18811,_PETER GRIMES._,"The trembling boy dropp'd down and strove to pray,"
18812,_PETER GRIMES._,"Received a blow, and trembling turn'd away,"
18813,_PETER GRIMES._,"Or sobb'd and hid his piteous face;--while he,"
18814,_PETER GRIMES._,"The savage master, grinn'd in horrid glee:"
18815,_PETER GRIMES._,"He'd now the power he ever loved to show,"
18816,_PETER GRIMES._,A feeling being subject to his blow.
18817,_PETER GRIMES._,"Thus lived the lad, in hunger, peril, pain,"
18818,_PETER GRIMES._,"His tears despised, his supplications vain.                         90"
18819,_PETER GRIMES._,"Compell'd by fear to lie, by need to steal,"
18820,_PETER GRIMES._,"His bed uneasy and unbless'd his meal,"
18821,_PETER GRIMES._,For three sad years the boy his tortures bore;
18822,_PETER GRIMES._,And then his pains and trials were no more.
18823,_PETER GRIMES._,"""How died he, Peter?"" when the people said,                        }"
18824,_PETER GRIMES._,"He growl'd--""I found him lifeless in his bed;""                       }"
18825,_PETER GRIMES._,"Then tried for softer tone, and sigh'd, ""Poor Sam is dead.""          }"
18826,_PETER GRIMES._,"Yet murmurs were there, and some questions ask'd--"
18827,_PETER GRIMES._,"How he was fed, how punish'd, and how task'd?"
18828,_PETER GRIMES._,"Much they suspected, but they little proved,                       100"
18829,_PETER GRIMES._,And Peter pass'd untroubled and unmoved.
18830,_PETER GRIMES._,"Another boy with equal ease was found,"
18831,_PETER GRIMES._,"The money granted, and the victim bound;"
18832,_PETER GRIMES._,"And what his fate?--One night, it chanced he fell"
18833,_PETER GRIMES._,"From the boat's mast and perish'd in her well,"
18834,_PETER GRIMES._,"Where fish were living kept, and where the boy"
18835,_PETER GRIMES._,(So reason'd men) could not himself destroy.
18836,_PETER GRIMES._,"""Yes! so it was,"" said Peter; ""in his play,"
18837,_PETER GRIMES._,"(For he was idle both by night and day,)"
18838,_PETER GRIMES._,"He climb'd the main-mast and then fell below;""--                   110"
18839,_PETER GRIMES._,Then show'd his corpse and pointed to the blow;--
18840,_PETER GRIMES._,"""What said the jury?""--They were long in doubt;"
18841,_PETER GRIMES._,But sturdy Peter faced the matter out:
18842,_PETER GRIMES._,"So they dismiss'd him, saying at the time,"
18843,_PETER GRIMES._,"""Keep fast your hatchway, when you've boys who climb."""
18844,_PETER GRIMES._,"This hit the conscience, and he colour'd more"
18845,_PETER GRIMES._,Than for the closest questions put before.
18846,_PETER GRIMES._,"Thus all his fears the verdict set aside,"
18847,_PETER GRIMES._,And at the slave-shop Peter still applied.
18848,_PETER GRIMES._,"Then came a boy, of manners soft and mild--                      120"
18849,_PETER GRIMES._,Our seamen's wives with grief beheld the child;
18850,_PETER GRIMES._,All thought (the poor themselves) that he was one
18851,_PETER GRIMES._,"Of gentle blood, some noble sinner's son,"
18852,_PETER GRIMES._,"Who had, belike, deceived some humble maid,"
18853,_PETER GRIMES._,Whom he had first seduced and then betray'd.--
18854,_PETER GRIMES._,"However this, he seem'd a gracious lad,"
18855,_PETER GRIMES._,In grief submissive and with patience sad.
18856,_PETER GRIMES._,"Passive he labour'd, till his slender frame"
18857,_PETER GRIMES._,"Bent with his loads, and he at length was lame;--"
18858,_PETER GRIMES._,Strange that a frame so weak could bear so long                    130
18859,_PETER GRIMES._,The grossest insult and the foulest wrong;
18860,_PETER GRIMES._,But there were causes--in the town they gave
18861,_PETER GRIMES._,"Fire, food, and comfort, to the gentle slave;"
18862,_PETER GRIMES._,"And though stern Peter, with a cruel hand,"
18863,_PETER GRIMES._,"And knotted rope, enforced the rude command,"
18864,_PETER GRIMES._,"Yet he consider'd what he'd lately felt,"
18865,_PETER GRIMES._,And his vile blows with selfish pity dealt.
18866,_PETER GRIMES._,One day such draughts the cruel fisher made
18867,_PETER GRIMES._,"He could not vend them in his borough-trade,"
18868,_PETER GRIMES._,"But sail'd for London-mart; the boy was ill,                       140"
18869,_PETER GRIMES._,But ever humbled to his master's will;
18870,_PETER GRIMES._,"And on the river, where they smoothly sail'd,"
18871,_PETER GRIMES._,He strove with terror and awhile prevail'd;
18872,_PETER GRIMES._,"But, new to danger on the angry sea,"
18873,_PETER GRIMES._,He clung affrighten'd to his master's knee.
18874,_PETER GRIMES._,"The boat grew leaky and the wind was strong,"
18875,_PETER GRIMES._,Rough was the passage and the time was long;
18876,_PETER GRIMES._,"His liquor fail'd, and Peter's wrath arose--"
18877,_PETER GRIMES._,"No more is known--the rest we must suppose,"
18878,_PETER GRIMES._,"Or learn of Peter;--Peter says, he ""spied                        150 }"
18879,_PETER GRIMES._,The stripling's danger and for harbour tried;                        }
18880,_PETER GRIMES._,"Meantime the fish, and then th' apprentice died.""                    }"
18881,_PETER GRIMES._,"The pitying women raised a clamour round,"
18882,_PETER GRIMES._,"And weeping said, ""Thou hast thy 'prentice drown'd."""
18883,_PETER GRIMES._,"Now the stern man was summon'd to the hall,"
18884,_PETER GRIMES._,To tell his tale before the burghers all.
18885,_PETER GRIMES._,"He gave th' account; profess'd the lad he loved,"
18886,_PETER GRIMES._,And kept his brazen features all unmoved.
18887,_PETER GRIMES._,"The mayor himself with tone severe replied,--"
18888,_PETER GRIMES._,"""Henceforth with thee shall never boy abide;                       160"
18889,_PETER GRIMES._,"Hire thee a freeman, whom thou durst not beat,"
18890,_PETER GRIMES._,"But who, in thy despite, will sleep and eat."
18891,_PETER GRIMES._,"Free thou art now!--again shouldst thou appear,"
18892,_PETER GRIMES._,"Thou'lt find thy sentence, like thy soul, severe."""
18893,_PETER GRIMES._,"Alas! for Peter not a helping hand,"
18894,_PETER GRIMES._,"So was he hated, could he now command;"
18895,_PETER GRIMES._,Alone he row'd his boat; alone he cast
18896,_PETER GRIMES._,"His nets beside, or made his anchor fast;"
18897,_PETER GRIMES._,To hold a rope or hear a curse was none--
18898,_PETER GRIMES._,He toil'd and rail'd; he groan'd and swore alone.                  170
18899,_PETER GRIMES._,"Thus by himself compell'd to live each day,"
18900,_PETER GRIMES._,To wait for certain hours the tide's delay;
18901,_PETER GRIMES._,"At the same times the same dull views to see,"
18902,_PETER GRIMES._,The bounding marsh-bank and the blighted tree;
18903,_PETER GRIMES._,The water only when the tides were high;
18904,_PETER GRIMES._,"When low, the mud half-cover'd and half-dry;"
18905,_PETER GRIMES._,"The sun-burnt tar that blisters on the planks,"
18906,_PETER GRIMES._,And bank-side stakes in their uneven ranks;
18907,_PETER GRIMES._,"Heaps of entangled weeds that slowly float,"
18908,_PETER GRIMES._,As the tide rolls by the impeded boat.                             180
18909,_PETER GRIMES._,"When tides were neap, and, in the sultry day,"
18910,_PETER GRIMES._,"Through the tall bounding mud-banks made their way,"
18911,_PETER GRIMES._,"Which on each side rose swelling, and below"
18912,_PETER GRIMES._,The dark warm flood ran silently and slow:
18913,_PETER GRIMES._,"There anchoring, Peter chose from man to hide,                       }"
18914,_PETER GRIMES._,"There hang his head, and view the lazy tide                          }"
18915,_PETER GRIMES._,In its hot slimy channel slowly glide;                               }
18916,_PETER GRIMES._,Where the small eels that left the deeper way
18917,_PETER GRIMES._,"For the warm shore, within the shallows play;"
18918,_PETER GRIMES._,"Where gaping muscles, left upon the mud,                           190"
18919,_PETER GRIMES._,Slope their slow passage to the fallen flood:--
18920,_PETER GRIMES._,Here dull and hopeless he'd lie down and trace
18921,_PETER GRIMES._,How sidelong crabs had scrawl'd their crooked race;
18922,_PETER GRIMES._,Or sadly listen to the tuneless cry
18923,_PETER GRIMES._,Of fishing gull or clanging golden-eye;
18924,_PETER GRIMES._,"What time the sea-birds to the marsh would come,                     }"
18925,_PETER GRIMES._,"And the loud bittern, from the bull-rush home,                       }"
18926,_PETER GRIMES._,Gave from the salt-ditch side the bellowing boom.                    }
18927,_PETER GRIMES._,"He nursed the feelings these dull scenes produce,"
18928,_PETER GRIMES._,And loved to stop beside the opening sluice;                       200
18929,_PETER GRIMES._,"Where the small stream, confined in narrow bound,"
18930,_PETER GRIMES._,"Ran with a dull, unvaried, sadd'ning sound;"
18931,_PETER GRIMES._,Where all presented to the eye or ear
18932,_PETER GRIMES._,"Oppress'd the soul with misery, grief, and fear."
18933,_PETER GRIMES._,"Besides these objects, there were places three,"
18934,_PETER GRIMES._,Which Peter seem'd with certain dread to see;
18935,_PETER GRIMES._,"When he drew near them he would turn from each,"
18936,_PETER GRIMES._,And loudly whistle till he pass'd the reach[71].
18937,_PETER GRIMES._,A change of scene to him brought no relief;
18938,_PETER GRIMES._,"In town, 'twas plain, men took him for a thief:                    210"
18939,_PETER GRIMES._,"The sailors' wives would stop him in the street,"
18940,_PETER GRIMES._,"And say, ""Now, Peter, thou'st no boy to beat;"""
18941,_PETER GRIMES._,"Infants at play, when they perceived him, ran,"
18942,_PETER GRIMES._,"Warning each other--""That's the wicked man;"""
18943,_PETER GRIMES._,"He growl'd an oath, and in an angry tone"
18944,_PETER GRIMES._,Cursed the whole place and wish'd to be alone.
18945,_PETER GRIMES._,"Alone he was, the same dull scenes in view,"
18946,_PETER GRIMES._,And still more gloomy in his sight they grew.
18947,_PETER GRIMES._,"Though man he hated, yet employ'd alone"
18948,_PETER GRIMES._,"At bootless labour, he would swear and groan,                      220"
18949,_PETER GRIMES._,"Cursing the shoals that glided by the spot,"
18950,_PETER GRIMES._,And gulls that caught them when his arts could not.
18951,_PETER GRIMES._,"Cold nervous tremblings shook his sturdy frame,"
18952,_PETER GRIMES._,And strange disease--he couldn't say the name;
18953,_PETER GRIMES._,"Wild were his dreams, and oft he rose in fright,"
18954,_PETER GRIMES._,Waked by his view of horrors in the night--

18960,_PETER GRIMES._,"A winter pass'd since Peter saw the town,"

18962,_PETER GRIMES._,"These, idly curious, with their glasses spied"
18963,_PETER GRIMES._,The ships in bay as anchored for the tide--
18964,_PETER GRIMES._,The river's craft--the bustle of the quay--
18965,_PETER GRIMES._,"And sea-port views, which landmen love to see."
18966,_PETER GRIMES._,"One, up the river, had a man and boat"
18967,_PETER GRIMES._,"Seen day by day, now anchor'd, now afloat;"

18971,_PETER GRIMES._,"At certain stations he would view the stream,"
18972,_PETER GRIMES._,"As if he stood bewilder'd in a dream,"
18973,_PETER GRIMES._,"Or that some power had chain'd him for a time,"
18974,_PETER GRIMES._,To feel a curse or meditate on crime.
18975,_PETER GRIMES._,"This known, some curious, some in pity went,"
18976,_PETER GRIMES._,"And others question'd--""Wretch, dost thou repent?"""
18977,_PETER GRIMES._,"He heard, he trembled, and in fear resign'd"
18978,_PETER GRIMES._,His boat; new terror fill'd his restless mind;                     250
18979,_PETER GRIMES._,"Furious he grew, and up the country ran,"
18980,_PETER GRIMES._,And there they seized him--a distemper'd man.--
18981,_PETER GRIMES._,"Him we received; and to a parish-bed,"
18982,_PETER GRIMES._,"Follow'd and cursed, the groaning man was led."
18983,_PETER GRIMES._,"Here when they saw him, whom they used to shun,"
18984,_PETER GRIMES._,"A lost, lone man, so harass'd and undone,"
18985,_PETER GRIMES._,"Our gentle females, ever prompt to feel,"
18986,_PETER GRIMES._,Perceived compassion on their anger steal;
18987,_PETER GRIMES._,His crimes they could not from their memories blot;
18988,_PETER GRIMES._,"But they were grieved, and trembled at his lot.                    260"
18989,_PETER GRIMES._,"A priest too came, to whom his words are told;"
18990,_PETER GRIMES._,And all the signs they shudder'd to behold.
18991,_PETER GRIMES._,"""Look! look!"" they cried; ""his limbs with horror shake,            }"
18992,_PETER GRIMES._,"And as he grinds his teeth, what noise they make!                    }"
18993,_PETER GRIMES._,"How glare his angry eyes, and yet he's not awake.                    }"
18994,_PETER GRIMES._,"See! what cold drops upon his forehead stand,"
18995,_PETER GRIMES._,"And how he clenches that broad bony hand."""
18996,_PETER GRIMES._,"The priest, attending, found he spoke at times"
18997,_PETER GRIMES._,As one alluding to his fears and crimes:
18998,_PETER GRIMES._,"""It was the fall,"" he mutter'd, ""I can show                        270"
18999,_PETER GRIMES._,"The manner how--I never struck a blow;""--"
19000,_PETER GRIMES._,"And then aloud--""Unhand me, free my chain;"
19001,_PETER GRIMES._,"On oath, he fell--it struck him to the brain;--"
19002,_PETER GRIMES._,Why ask my father?--that old man will swear
19003,_PETER GRIMES._,"Against my life; besides, he wasn't there;--"
19004,_PETER GRIMES._,"What, all agreed?--Am I to die to-day?--"
19005,_PETER GRIMES._,"My Lord, in mercy, give me time to pray."""
19006,_PETER GRIMES._,"Then, as they watch'd him, calmer he became,"
19007,_PETER GRIMES._,"And grew so weak he couldn't move his frame,"
19008,_PETER GRIMES._,But murmuring spake--while they could see and hear                 280
19009,_PETER GRIMES._,The start of terror and the groan of fear;
19010,_PETER GRIMES._,"See the large dew-beads on his forehead rise,"
19011,_PETER GRIMES._,And the cold death-drop glaze his sunken eyes;
19012,_PETER GRIMES._,"Nor yet he died, but with unwonted force"
19013,_PETER GRIMES._,Seem'd with some fancied being to discourse.
19014,_PETER GRIMES._,"He knew not us, or with accustom'd art"
19015,_PETER GRIMES._,"He hid the knowledge, yet exposed his heart;"
19016,_PETER GRIMES._,"'Twas part confession and the rest defence,"
19017,_PETER GRIMES._,"A madman's tale, with gleams of waking sense."
19018,_PETER GRIMES._,"""I'll tell you all,"" he said; ""the very day                      290"
19019,_PETER GRIMES._,When the old man first placed them in my way:
19020,_PETER GRIMES._,My father's spirit--he who always tried
19021,_PETER GRIMES._,"To give me trouble, when he lived and died--"
19022,_PETER GRIMES._,"When he was gone, he could not be content"
19023,_PETER GRIMES._,"To see my days in painful labour spent,"
19024,_PETER GRIMES._,"But would appoint his meetings, and he made"
19025,_PETER GRIMES._,"Me watch at these, and so neglect my trade."
19026,_PETER GRIMES._,"""'Twas one hot noon, all silent, still, serene;"
19027,_PETER GRIMES._,No living being had I lately seen;
19028,_PETER GRIMES._,"I paddled up and down and dipp'd my net,                           300"
19029,_PETER GRIMES._,But (such his pleasure) I could nothing get--
19030,_PETER GRIMES._,"A father's pleasure, when his toil was done,"
19031,_PETER GRIMES._,To plague and torture thus an only son!
19032,_PETER GRIMES._,"And so I sat and look'd upon the stream,"
19033,_PETER GRIMES._,"How it ran on, and felt as in a dream--"
19034,_PETER GRIMES._,But dream it was not; no!--I fix'd my eyes
19035,_PETER GRIMES._,On the mid stream and saw the spirits rise;
19036,_PETER GRIMES._,"I saw my father on the water stand,"
19037,_PETER GRIMES._,And held a thin pale boy in either hand;
19038,_PETER GRIMES._,And there they glided ghastly on the top                           310
19039,_PETER GRIMES._,"Of the salt flood, and never touch'd a drop."
19040,_PETER GRIMES._,"I would have struck them, but they knew th' intent,"
19041,_PETER GRIMES._,"And smiled upon the oar, and down they went."
19042,_PETER GRIMES._,"""Now, from that day, whenever I began"
19043,_PETER GRIMES._,"To dip my net, there stood the hard old man--"
19044,_PETER GRIMES._,He and those boys; I humbled me and pray'd
19045,_PETER GRIMES._,"They would be gone;--they heeded not, but stay'd."
19046,_PETER GRIMES._,"Nor could I turn, nor would the boat go by,                          }"
19047,_PETER GRIMES._,"But gazing on the spirits, there was I;                              }"
19048,_PETER GRIMES._,"They bade me leap to death, but I was loth to die.               320 }"
19049,_PETER GRIMES._,"And every day, as sure as day arose,"
19050,_PETER GRIMES._,Would these three spirits meet me ere the close;
19051,_PETER GRIMES._,"To hear and mark them daily was my doom,"
19052,_PETER GRIMES._,"And 'Come,' they said, with weak, sad voices, 'come.'"
19053,_PETER GRIMES._,To row away with all my strength I try'd;                            }
19054,_PETER GRIMES._,"But there were they, hard by me in the tide,                         }"
19055,_PETER GRIMES._,"The three unbodied forms--and 'Come,' still 'come,' they cried.      }"
19056,_PETER GRIMES._,"""Fathers should pity--but this old man shook"
19057,_PETER GRIMES._,"His hoary locks, and froze me by a look."
19058,_PETER GRIMES._,"Thrice, when I struck them, through the water came                 330"
19059,_PETER GRIMES._,A hollow groan that weakened all my frame;
19060,_PETER GRIMES._,"'Father!' said I, 'have mercy!'--He replied,"
19061,_PETER GRIMES._,"I know not what--the angry spirit lied,--"
19062,_PETER GRIMES._,"'Didst thou not draw thy knife?' said he;--'Twas true,"
19063,_PETER GRIMES._,But I had pity and my arm withdrew;
19064,_PETER GRIMES._,"He cried for mercy which I kindly gave,"
19065,_PETER GRIMES._,But he has no compassion in his grave.
19066,_PETER GRIMES._,"""There were three places, where they ever rose;--"
19067,_PETER GRIMES._,The whole long river has not such as those--
19068,_PETER GRIMES._,"Places accursed, where, if a man remain,                           340"
19069,_PETER GRIMES._,He'll see the things which strike him to the brain;
19070,_PETER GRIMES._,"And there they made me on my paddle lean,"
19071,_PETER GRIMES._,And look at them for hours--accursed scene!
19072,_PETER GRIMES._,"When they would glide to that smooth eddy-space,"
19073,_PETER GRIMES._,Then bid me leap and join them in the place;
19074,_PETER GRIMES._,And at my groans each little villain sprite
19075,_PETER GRIMES._,Enjoy'd my pains and vanish'd in delight.
19076,_PETER GRIMES._,"""In one fierce summer-day, when my poor brain"
19077,_PETER GRIMES._,"Was burning hot and cruel was my pain,"
19078,_PETER GRIMES._,Then came this father-foe; and there he stood                      350
19079,_PETER GRIMES._,With his two boys again upon the flood;
19080,_PETER GRIMES._,"There was more mischief in their eyes, more glee"
19081,_PETER GRIMES._,In their pale faces when they glared at me.
19082,_PETER GRIMES._,"Still did they force me on the oar to rest,"
19083,_PETER GRIMES._,"And when they saw me fainting and oppress'd,"
19084,_PETER GRIMES._,"He, with his hand, the old man, scoop'd the flood,"
19085,_PETER GRIMES._,"And there came flame about him, mix'd with blood;"
19086,_PETER GRIMES._,"He bade me stoop and look upon the place,"
19087,_PETER GRIMES._,Then flung the hot-red liquor in my face;
19088,_PETER GRIMES._,"Burning it blazed, and then I roar'd for pain,                     360"
19089,_PETER GRIMES._,I thought the demons would have turn'd my brain.
19090,_PETER GRIMES._,"""Still there they stood, and forced me to behold"
19091,_PETER GRIMES._,A place of horrors--they cannot be told--
19092,_PETER GRIMES._,"Where the flood open'd, there I heard the shriek"
19093,_PETER GRIMES._,Of tortured guilt no earthly tongue can speak:
19094,_PETER GRIMES._,"'All days alike! for ever!' did they say,"
19095,_PETER GRIMES._,'And unremitted torments every day!'--
19096,_PETER GRIMES._,"Yes, so they said;""--but here he ceased and gazed"
19097,_PETER GRIMES._,"On all around, affrighten'd and amazed;"
19098,_PETER GRIMES._,"And still he tried to speak, and look'd in dread                   370"
19099,_PETER GRIMES._,Of frighten'd females gathering round his bed;
19100,_PETER GRIMES._,"Then dropp'd exhausted and appear'd at rest,"
19101,_PETER GRIMES._,Till the strong foe the vital powers possess'd;
19102,_PETER GRIMES._,"Then with an inward, broken voice he cried,"
19103,_PETER GRIMES._,"""Again they come,"" and mutter'd as he died."

19258,_PRISONS._,"While thus observing, I began to trace"
19259,_PRISONS._,The sober'd features of a well-known face--
19260,_PRISONS._,"Looks once familiar, manners form'd to please,"
19261,_PRISONS._,And all illumined by a heart at ease.
19262,_PRISONS._,But fraud and flattery ever claim'd a part
19263,_PRISONS._,(Still unresisted) of that easy heart;
19264,_PRISONS._,"But he at length beholds me--""Ah! my friend!"

19270,_PRISONS._,"Pleasure, the mistress to whose arms I fled,"
19271,_PRISONS._,From wife-like lectures angry prudence read.
19272,_PRISONS._,"""Why speak the madness of a life like mine,"
19273,_PRISONS._,"The powers of beauty, novelty, and wine?"
19274,_PRISONS._,"Why paint the wanton smile, the venal vow,"
19275,_PRISONS._,Or friends whose worth I can appreciate now?                       130
19276,_PRISONS._,"""Oft I perceived my fate, and then would say,"
19277,_PRISONS._,"'I'll think to-morrow, I must live to-day:'"

19279,_PRISONS._,"And here, where thought is painful, think I must."
19280,_PRISONS._,But speech is pleasant; this discourse with thee
19281,_PRISONS._,Brings to my mind the sweets of liberty;
19282,_PRISONS._,"Breaks on the sameness of the place, and gives"
19283,_PRISONS._,"The doubtful heart conviction that it lives,"
19284,_PRISONS._,"""Let me describe my anguish in the hour"
19285,_PRISONS._,When law detained me and I felt its power.                         140
19286,_PRISONS._,"""When in that shipwreck, this I found my shore,"
19287,_PRISONS._,"And join'd the wretched, who were wreck'd before;"
19288,_PRISONS._,When I perceived each feature in the face
19289,_PRISONS._,Pinch'd through neglect or turbid by disgrace;
19290,_PRISONS._,When in these wasting forms affliction stood
19291,_PRISONS._,"In my afflicted view, it chill'd my blood;--"
19292,_PRISONS._,"And forth I rush'd, a quick retreat to make,"
19293,_PRISONS._,Till a loud laugh proclaim'd the dire mistake.
19294,_PRISONS._,But when the groan had settled to a sigh;
19295,_PRISONS._,When gloom became familiar to the eye;                             150
19296,_PRISONS._,"When I perceive how others seem to rest,"
19297,_PRISONS._,With every evil rankling in my breast--

19304,_PRISONS._,"Where shade meets shade, and round the gloomy meads"
19305,_PRISONS._,They glide and speak of old heroic deeds--                         160
19306,_PRISONS._,"What fields they conquer'd, and what foes they slew"
19307,_PRISONS._,And sent to join the melancholy crew.
19308,_PRISONS._,"""When a new spirit in that world was found,"
19309,_PRISONS._,A thousand shadowy forms came flitting round;
19310,_PRISONS._,"Those who had known him, fond inquiries made:--"
19311,_PRISONS._,"'Of all we left, inform us, gentle shade,"
19312,_PRISONS._,"Now as we lead thee in our realms to dwell,"
19313,_PRISONS._,"Our twilight groves, and meads of asphodel.'"
19314,_PRISONS._,"""What paints the poet, is our station here,"
19315,_PRISONS._,Where we like ghosts and flitting shades appear:                   170
19316,_PRISONS._,"This is the hell he sings, and here we meet,"
19317,_PRISONS._,And former deeds to new-made friends repeat;
19318,_PRISONS._,"Heroic deeds, which here obtain us fame,"
19319,_PRISONS._,And are in fact the causes why we came.
19320,_PRISONS._,"Yes! this dim region is old Homer's hell,"
19321,_PRISONS._,Abate but groves and meads of asphodel.
19322,_PRISONS._,"""Here, when a stranger from your world we spy,"
19323,_PRISONS._,We gather round him and for news apply;
19324,_PRISONS._,"He hears unheeding, nor can speech endure,"
19325,_PRISONS._,But shivering gazes on the vast obscure.                           180
19326,_PRISONS._,"We, smiling, pity, and by kindness show"
19327,_PRISONS._,We felt his feelings and his terrors know;
19328,_PRISONS._,"Then speak of comfort--time will give him sight,"
19329,_PRISONS._,"Where now 'tis dark; where now 'tis wo, delight."
19330,_PRISONS._,"""'Have hope,' we say, 'and soon the place to thee"
19331,_PRISONS._,Shall not a prison but a castle be;
19332,_PRISONS._,"When to the wretch whom care and guilt confound,"
19333,_PRISONS._,"The world's a prison, with a wider bound;"
19334,_PRISONS._,"Go where he may, he feels himself confined,"
19335,_PRISONS._,And wears the fetters of an abject mind.'                          190

19346,_PRISONS._,"Farewell to these; but other scenes I view,"
19347,_PRISONS._,"And other griefs, and guilt of deeper hue;"
19348,_PRISONS._,"Where conscience gives to outward ills her pain,"
19349,_PRISONS._,"Gloom to the night, and pressure to the chain."
19350,_PRISONS._,Here separate cells awhile in misery keep
19351,_PRISONS._,Two doom'd to suffer; there they strive for sleep;
19352,_PRISONS._,"By day indulged, in larger space they range,"
19353,_PRISONS._,"Their bondage certain, but their bounds have change."
19354,_PRISONS._,"One was a female, who had grievous ill"

19356,_PRISONS._,"With death before her, and her fate in view,"
19357,_PRISONS._,Unsated vengeance in her bosom grew;
19358,_PRISONS._,Sullen she was and threat'ning; in her eye
19359,_PRISONS._,Glared the stern triumph that she dared to die;
19360,_PRISONS._,But first a being in the world must leave--
19361,_PRISONS._,'Twas once reproach; 'twas now a short reprieve.
19362,_PRISONS._,"She was a pauper bound, who early gave"
19363,_PRISONS._,"Her mind to vice, and doubly was a slave;"
19364,_PRISONS._,"Upbraided, beaten, held by rough control,"
19365,_PRISONS._,"Revenge sustain'd, inspired, and fill'd her soul.                  220"
19366,_PRISONS._,"She fired a full-stored barn, confess'd the fact,"
19367,_PRISONS._,And laugh'd at law and justified the act.
19368,_PRISONS._,"Our gentle vicar tried his powers in vain,"
19369,_PRISONS._,"She answer'd not, or answer'd with disdain;"
19370,_PRISONS._,"Th' approaching fate she heard without a sigh,"
19371,_PRISONS._,And neither cared to live nor fear'd to die.
19372,_PRISONS._,"Not so he felt, who with her was to pay"
19373,_PRISONS._,"The forfeit, life--with dread he view'd the day,"
19374,_PRISONS._,"And that short space which yet for him remain'd,"
19375,_PRISONS._,Till with his limbs his faculties were chain'd.                    230
19376,_PRISONS._,"He paced his narrow bounds some ease to find,"
19377,_PRISONS._,"But found it not,--no comfort reached his mind."
19378,_PRISONS._,"Each sense was palsied; when he tasted food,"
19379,_PRISONS._,"He sigh'd and said, ""Enough--'tis very good."""
19380,_PRISONS._,"Since his dread sentence, nothing seem'd to be"
19381,_PRISONS._,"As once it was--he seeing could not see,"
19382,_PRISONS._,"Nor hearing, hear aright;--when first, I came"
19383,_PRISONS._,"Within his view, I fancied there was shame,"
19384,_PRISONS._,"I judged, resentment; I mistook the air--"
19385,_PRISONS._,"These fainter passions live not with despair,                      240"
19386,_PRISONS._,"Or but exist and die;--Hope, fear, and love,"
19387,_PRISONS._,"Joy, doubt, and hate, may other spirits move,"
19388,_PRISONS._,"But touch not his, who every waking hour"
19389,_PRISONS._,"Has one fix'd dread, and always feels its power."
19390,_PRISONS._,"""But will not mercy?""--No! she cannot plead"
19391,_PRISONS._,For such an outrage;--'twas a cruel deed:
19392,_PRISONS._,"He stopp'd a timid traveller;--to his breast,"
19393,_PRISONS._,"With oaths and curses, was the danger press'd:--"
19394,_PRISONS._,No! he must suffer; pity we may find
19395,_PRISONS._,"For one man's pangs, but must not wrong mankind.                   250"
19396,_PRISONS._,"Still I behold him, every thought employ'd"
19397,_PRISONS._,On one dire view!--all others are destroy'd;
19398,_PRISONS._,"This makes his features ghastly, gives the tone"
19399,_PRISONS._,Of his few words resemblance to a groan.
19400,_PRISONS._,"He takes his tasteless food, and, when 'tis done,"
19401,_PRISONS._,"Counts up his meals, now lessen'd by that one;"
19402,_PRISONS._,"For expectation is on time intent,"
19403,_PRISONS._,Whether he brings us joy or punishment.
19404,_PRISONS._,Yes! e'en in sleep the impressions all remain;
19405,_PRISONS._,He hears the sentence and he feels the chain;                      260
19406,_PRISONS._,"He sees the judge and jury, when he shakes,"
19407,_PRISONS._,"And loudly cries, ""Not guilty,"" and awakes."
19408,_PRISONS._,"Then chilling tremblings o'er his body creep,"
19409,_PRISONS._,Till worn-out nature is compell'd to sleep.
19410,_PRISONS._,"Now comes the dream again; it shows each scene,"
19411,_PRISONS._,With each small circumstance that comes between--
19412,_PRISONS._,The call to suffering and the very deed--
19413,_PRISONS._,"There crowds go with him, follow, and precede;"
19414,_PRISONS._,"Some heartless shout, some pity, all condemn,"
19415,_PRISONS._,While he in fancied envy looks at them.                            270
19416,_PRISONS._,"He seems the place for that sad act to see,"
19417,_PRISONS._,And dreams the very thirst which then will be;
19418,_PRISONS._,"A priest attends--it seems, the one he knew"
19419,_PRISONS._,"In his best days, beneath whose care he grew."
19420,_PRISONS._,"At this his terrors take a sudden flight,"
19421,_PRISONS._,He sees his native village with delight;
19422,_PRISONS._,"The house, the chamber, where he once array'd"
19423,_PRISONS._,His youthful person; where he knelt and pray'd.
19424,_PRISONS._,"Then too the comforts he enjoy'd at home,"
19425,_PRISONS._,The days of joy; the joys themselves are come--                    280
19426,_PRISONS._,The hours of innocence--the timid look
19427,_PRISONS._,"Of his loved maid, when first her hand he took"
19428,_PRISONS._,"And told his hope; her trembling joy appears,"
19429,_PRISONS._,Her forced reserve and his retreating fears.
19430,_PRISONS._,All now is present;--'tis a moment's gleam
19431,_PRISONS._,"Of former sunshine--stay, delightful dream!"
19432,_PRISONS._,"Let him within his pleasant garden walk,"
19433,_PRISONS._,"Give him her arm, of blessings let them talk."
19434,_PRISONS._,"Yes! all are with him now, and all the while"
19435,_PRISONS._,Life's early prospects and his Fanny's smile:                      290
19436,_PRISONS._,"Then come his sister and his village-friend,"
19437,_PRISONS._,And he will now the sweetest moments spend
19438,_PRISONS._,Life has to yield;--no! never will he find
19439,_PRISONS._,Again on earth such pleasure in his mind:
19440,_PRISONS._,"He goes through shrubby walks these friends among,"
19441,_PRISONS._,Love in their looks and honour on the tongue;
19442,_PRISONS._,"Nay, there's a charm beyond what nature shows,"
19443,_PRISONS._,The bloom is softer and more sweetly grows;--
19444,_PRISONS._,"Pierced by no crime, and urged by no desire"
19445,_PRISONS._,"For more than true and honest hearts require,                      300"
19446,_PRISONS._,"They feel the calm delight, and thus proceed"
19447,_PRISONS._,Through the green lane--then linger in the mead--
19448,_PRISONS._,Stray o'er the heath in all its purple bloom--
19449,_PRISONS._,And pluck the blossom where the wild bees hum;
19450,_PRISONS._,"Then through the broomy bound with ease they pass,"
19451,_PRISONS._,"And press the sandy sheep-walk's slender grass,"
19452,_PRISONS._,"Where dwarfish flowers among the gorse are spread,"
19453,_PRISONS._,And the lamb browses by the linnet's bed;
19454,_PRISONS._,Then 'cross the bounding brook they make their way
19455,_PRISONS._,O'er its rough bridge--and there behold the bay!--                 310
19456,_PRISONS._,The ocean smiling to the fervid sun--
19457,_PRISONS._,The waves that faintly fall and slowly run--
19458,_PRISONS._,The ships at distance and the boats at hand;
19459,_PRISONS._,"And now they walk upon the sea-side sand,"
19460,_PRISONS._,"Counting the number and what kind they be,"
19461,_PRISONS._,Ships softly sinking in the sleepy sea;
19462,_PRISONS._,"Now arm in arm, now parted, they behold"
19463,_PRISONS._,The glitt'ring waters on the shingles roll'd;
19464,_PRISONS._,"The timid girls, half dreading their design,"
19465,_PRISONS._,"Dip the small foot in the retarded brine,                          320"
19466,_PRISONS._,"And search for crimson weeds, which spreading flow,"
19467,_PRISONS._,Or lie like pictures on the sand below;
19468,_PRISONS._,With all those bright red pebbles that the sun
19469,_PRISONS._,Through the small waves so softly shines upon;
19470,_PRISONS._,And those live lucid jellies which the eye
19471,_PRISONS._,Delights to trace as they swim glitt'ring by:
19472,_PRISONS._,"Pearl-shells and rubied star-fish they admire,"

19551,_SCHOOLS._,And to her gown the sturdiest rogue can pin.
19552,_SCHOOLS._,"Aided by these, and spells, and tell-tale birds,"
19553,_SCHOOLS._,Her power they dread and reverence her words.
19554,_SCHOOLS._,"To learning's second seats we now proceed,"
19555,_SCHOOLS._,Where humming students gilded primers read;                         20
19556,_SCHOOLS._,"Or books with letters large and pictures gay,"
19557,_SCHOOLS._,To make their reading but a kind of play--
19558,_SCHOOLS._,"""Reading made Easy,"" so the titles tell;"
19559,_SCHOOLS._,But they who read must first begin to spell.
19560,_SCHOOLS._,"There may be profit in these arts, but still"
19561,_SCHOOLS._,"Learning is labour, call it what you will--"
19562,_SCHOOLS._,Upon the youthful mind a heavy load;
19563,_SCHOOLS._,Nor must we hope to find the royal road.
19564,_SCHOOLS._,"Some will their easy steps to science show,"
19565,_SCHOOLS._,And some to heav'n itself their by-way know;                        30
19566,_SCHOOLS._,"Ah! trust them not;--who fame or bliss would share,"
19567,_SCHOOLS._,"Must learn by labour, and must live by care."
19568,_SCHOOLS._,Another matron of superior kind
19569,_SCHOOLS._,For higher schools prepares the rising mind;
19570,_SCHOOLS._,"_Preparatory_ she her learning calls,"
19571,_SCHOOLS._,The step first made to colleges and halls.
19572,_SCHOOLS._,"She early sees to what the mind will grow,"
19573,_SCHOOLS._,Nor abler judge of infant-powers I know;
19574,_SCHOOLS._,"She sees what soon the lively will impede,"
19575,_SCHOOLS._,And how the steadier will in turn succeed;                          40
19576,_SCHOOLS._,"Observes the dawn of wisdom, fancy, taste,"
19577,_SCHOOLS._,And knows what parts will wear and what will waste:
19578,_SCHOOLS._,"She marks the mind too lively, and at once"
19579,_SCHOOLS._,Sees the gay coxcomb and the rattling dunce.
19580,_SCHOOLS._,"Long has she lived, and much she loves to trace"
19581,_SCHOOLS._,"Her former pupils, now a lordly race;"
19582,_SCHOOLS._,"Whom when she sees rich robes and furs bedeck,"
19583,_SCHOOLS._,She marks the pride which once she strove to check.
19584,_SCHOOLS._,"A burgess comes, and she remembers well"
19585,_SCHOOLS._,How hard her task to make his worship spell;                        50
19586,_SCHOOLS._,"Cold, selfish, dull, inanimate, unkind,"
19587,_SCHOOLS._,'Twas but by anger he display'd a mind;
19588,_SCHOOLS._,"Now civil, smiling, complaisant, and gay,"
19589,_SCHOOLS._,The world has worn th' unsocial crust away;
19590,_SCHOOLS._,"That sullen spirit now a softness wears,"
19591,_SCHOOLS._,"And, save by fits, e'en dulness disappears:"
19592,_SCHOOLS._,"But still the matron can the man behold,"
19593,_SCHOOLS._,"Dull, selfish, hard, inanimate, and cold."
19594,_SCHOOLS._,"A merchant passes;--""probity and truth,"
19595,_SCHOOLS._,"Prudence and patience, mark'd thee from thy youth.""                 60"
19596,_SCHOOLS._,"Thus she observes, but oft retains her fears"
19597,_SCHOOLS._,"For him, who now with name unstain'd appears;"
19598,_SCHOOLS._,Nor hope relinquishes for one who yet
19599,_SCHOOLS._,Is lost in error and involved in debt;
19600,_SCHOOLS._,"For latent evil in that heart she found,"
19601,_SCHOOLS._,"More open here, but here the core was sound."
19602,_SCHOOLS._,Various our day-schools: here behold we one
19603,_SCHOOLS._,"Empty and still;--the morning duties done,"
19604,_SCHOOLS._,"Soil'd, tatter'd, worn, and thrown in various heaps,"
19605,_SCHOOLS._,"Appear their books, and there confusion sleeps;                     70"
19606,_SCHOOLS._,"The workmen all are from the Babel fled,"
19607,_SCHOOLS._,"And lost their tools, till the return they dread."
19608,_SCHOOLS._,"Meantime the master, with his wig awry,"
19609,_SCHOOLS._,Prepares his books for business by-and-by.
19610,_SCHOOLS._,Now all th' insignia of the monarch laid
19611,_SCHOOLS._,"Beside him rest, and none stand by afraid;"
19612,_SCHOOLS._,"He, while his troop light-hearted leap and play,"
19613,_SCHOOLS._,Is all intent on duties of the day;
19614,_SCHOOLS._,"No more the tyrant stern or judge severe,"
19615,_SCHOOLS._,He feels the father's and the husband's fear.                       80
19616,_SCHOOLS._,"Ah! little think the timid trembling crowd,"
19617,_SCHOOLS._,"That one so wise, so powerful, and so proud,"
19618,_SCHOOLS._,"Should feel himself, and dread the humble ills"
19619,_SCHOOLS._,Of rent-day charges and of coalman's bills;
19620,_SCHOOLS._,"That, while they mercy from their judge implore,"
19621,_SCHOOLS._,He fears himself--a knocking at the door;
19622,_SCHOOLS._,And feels the burthen as his neighbour states
19623,_SCHOOLS._,His humble portion to the parish-rates.
19624,_SCHOOLS._,"They sit th' allotted hours, then eager run,"
19625,_SCHOOLS._,Rushing to pleasure when the duty's done;                           90
19626,_SCHOOLS._,"His hour of leisure is of different kind,"
19627,_SCHOOLS._,Then cares domestic rush upon his mind;
19628,_SCHOOLS._,"And half the ease and comfort he enjoys,"
19629,_SCHOOLS._,"Is when surrounded by slates, books, and boys."
19630,_SCHOOLS._,Poor Reuben Dixon has the noisiest school
19631,_SCHOOLS._,"Of ragged lads, who ever bow'd to rule;"
19632,_SCHOOLS._,"Low in his price--the men who heave our coals,"
19633,_SCHOOLS._,"And clean our causeways, send him boys in shoals."
19634,_SCHOOLS._,"To see poor Reuben, with his fry beside--"
19635,_SCHOOLS._,Their half-check'd rudeness and his half-scorn'd pride--           100
19636,_SCHOOLS._,"Their room, the sty in which th' assembly meet,"
19637,_SCHOOLS._,In the close lane behind the Northgate-street;
19638,_SCHOOLS._,"T' observe his vain attempts to keep the peace,"
19639,_SCHOOLS._,"Till tolls the bell, and strife and troubles cease,"
19640,_SCHOOLS._,"Calls for our praise; his labour praise deserves,"
19641,_SCHOOLS._,But not our pity; Reuben has no nerves.
19642,_SCHOOLS._,"'Mid noise and dirt, and stench, and play, and prate,"
19643,_SCHOOLS._,He calmly cuts the pen or views the slate.
19644,_SCHOOLS._,"But Leonard!--yes, for Leonard's fate I grieve,"
19645,_SCHOOLS._,Who loathes the station which he dares not leave;                  110
19646,_SCHOOLS._,"He cannot dig, he will not beg his bread;"
19647,_SCHOOLS._,All his dependence rests upon his head;
19648,_SCHOOLS._,"And, deeply skill'd in sciences and arts,"
19649,_SCHOOLS._,On vulgar lads he wastes superior parts.
19650,_SCHOOLS._,"Alas! what grief that feeling mind sustains,"
19651,_SCHOOLS._,In guiding hands and stirring torpid brains;
19652,_SCHOOLS._,"He whose proud mind from pole to pole will move,"
19653,_SCHOOLS._,And view the wonders of the worlds above;
19654,_SCHOOLS._,"Who thinks and reasons strongly--hard his fate,"
19655,_SCHOOLS._,Confined for ever to the pen and slate.                            120
19656,_SCHOOLS._,"True, he submits, and when the long dull day"
19657,_SCHOOLS._,"Has slowly pass'd, in weary tasks, away,"
19658,_SCHOOLS._,"To other worlds with cheerful view he looks,"
19659,_SCHOOLS._,And parts the night between repose and books.
19660,_SCHOOLS._,"Amid his labours, he has sometimes tried"
19661,_SCHOOLS._,To turn a little from his cares aside;
19662,_SCHOOLS._,"Pope, Milton, Dryden, with delight has seized,"
19663,_SCHOOLS._,His soul engaged and of his trouble eased.
19664,_SCHOOLS._,"When, with a heavy eye and ill-done sum,"
19665,_SCHOOLS._,"No part conceived, a stupid boy will come;                         130"
19666,_SCHOOLS._,"Then Leonard first subdues the rising frown,"
19667,_SCHOOLS._,And bids the blockhead lay his blunders down;
19668,_SCHOOLS._,"O'er which disgusted he will turn his eye,                           }"
19669,_SCHOOLS._,"To his sad duty his sound mind apply,                                }"
19670,_SCHOOLS._,"And, vex'd in spirit, throw his pleasures by.                        }"
19671,_SCHOOLS._,Turn we to schools which more than these afford--
19672,_SCHOOLS._,The sound instruction and the wholesome board;
19673,_SCHOOLS._,And first our school for ladies:--pity calls
19674,_SCHOOLS._,"For one soft sigh, when we behold these walls,"
19675,_SCHOOLS._,"Placed near the town, and where, from window high,                 140"
19676,_SCHOOLS._,"The fair, confined, may our free crowds espy,"
19677,_SCHOOLS._,"With many a stranger gazing up and down,"
19678,_SCHOOLS._,And all the envied tumult of the town;
19679,_SCHOOLS._,"May, in the smiling summer-eve, when they"
19680,_SCHOOLS._,"Are sent to sleep the pleasant hours away,"
19681,_SCHOOLS._,Behold the poor (whom they conceive the bless'd)
19682,_SCHOOLS._,"Employ'd for hours, and grieved they cannot rest."
19683,_SCHOOLS._,"Here the fond girl, whose days are sad and few"
19684,_SCHOOLS._,"Since dear mamma pronounced the last adieu,"
19685,_SCHOOLS._,"Looks to the road, and fondly thinks she hears                     150"
19686,_SCHOOLS._,"The carriage-wheels, and struggles with her tears."
19687,_SCHOOLS._,"All yet is new, the misses great and small,"
19688,_SCHOOLS._,"Madam herself, and teachers, odious all;"
19689,_SCHOOLS._,"From laughter, pity, nay command, she turns,"
19690,_SCHOOLS._,"But melts in softness, or with anger burns;"
19691,_SCHOOLS._,"Nauseates her food, and wonders who can sleep"
19692,_SCHOOLS._,"On such mean beds, where she can only weep."
19693,_SCHOOLS._,She scorns condolence--but to all she hates
19694,_SCHOOLS._,Slowly at length her mind accommodates;
19695,_SCHOOLS._,Then looks on bondage with the same concern                        160
19696,_SCHOOLS._,"As others felt, and finds that she must learn"
19697,_SCHOOLS._,"As others learn'd--the common lot to share,"
19698,_SCHOOLS._,To search for comfort and submit to care.
19699,_SCHOOLS._,"There are, 'tis said, who on these seats attend,"
19700,_SCHOOLS._,And to these ductile minds destruction vend;
19701,_SCHOOLS._,"Wretches (to virtue, peace, and nature, foes)"
19702,_SCHOOLS._,"To these soft minds, their wicked trash expose;"
19703,_SCHOOLS._,"Seize on the soul, ere passions take the sway,"
19704,_SCHOOLS._,"And lead the heart, ere yet it feels, astray:"
19705,_SCHOOLS._,Smugglers obscene!--and can there be who take                      170
19706,_SCHOOLS._,"Infernal pains, the sleeping vice to wake?"
19707,_SCHOOLS._,"Can there be those, by whom the thought defiled"
19708,_SCHOOLS._,Enters the spotless bosom of a child?
19709,_SCHOOLS._,"By whom the ill is to the heart convey'd,                            }"
19710,_SCHOOLS._,"Who lend the foe, not yet in arms, their aid,                        }"
19711,_SCHOOLS._,And sap the city-walls before the siege be laid?                     }
19712,_SCHOOLS._,"Oh! rather skulking in the by-ways steal,"
19713,_SCHOOLS._,And rob the poorest traveller of his meal;
19714,_SCHOOLS._,Burst through the humblest trader's bolted door;
19715,_SCHOOLS._,Bear from the widow's hut her winter-store;                        180
19716,_SCHOOLS._,"With stolen steed on highways take your stand,"
19717,_SCHOOLS._,"Your lips with curses arm'd, with death your hand;--"
19718,_SCHOOLS._,"Take all but life--the virtuous more would say,                      }"
19719,_SCHOOLS._,"Take life itself, dear as it is, away,                               }"
19720,_SCHOOLS._,Rather than guilty thus the guileless soul betray.                   }
19721,_SCHOOLS._,"Years, pass away--let us suppose them past,"
19722,_SCHOOLS._,Th' accomplish'd nymph for freedom looks at last;
19723,_SCHOOLS._,"All hardships over, which a school contains,"
19724,_SCHOOLS._,The spirit's bondage and the body's pains;
19725,_SCHOOLS._,"Where teachers make the heartless, trembling set                   190"
19726,_SCHOOLS._,Of pupils suffer for their own regret;
19727,_SCHOOLS._,"Where winter's cold, attack'd by one poor fire,"
19728,_SCHOOLS._,"Chills the fair child, commanded to retire;"
19729,_SCHOOLS._,"She felt it keenly in the morning air,"
19730,_SCHOOLS._,Keenly she felt it at the evening prayer.
19731,_SCHOOLS._,More pleasant summer; but then walks were made
19732,_SCHOOLS._,"Not a sweet ramble, but a slow parade;"
19733,_SCHOOLS._,"They moved by pairs beside the hawthorn-hedge,"
19734,_SCHOOLS._,Only to set their feelings on an edge;
19735,_SCHOOLS._,"And now at eve, when all their spirits rise,                       200"
19736,_SCHOOLS._,"Are sent to rest, and all their pleasure dies;"
19737,_SCHOOLS._,"Where yet they all the town alert can see,"
19738,_SCHOOLS._,And distant plough-boys pacing o'er the lea.
19739,_SCHOOLS._,These and the tasks successive masters brought--
19740,_SCHOOLS._,"The French they conn'd, the curious works they wrought,"
19741,_SCHOOLS._,"The hours they made their taper fingers strike,"
19742,_SCHOOLS._,"Note after note, all dull to them alike;"
19743,_SCHOOLS._,"Their drawings, dancings on appointed days,"
19744,_SCHOOLS._,"Playing with globes, and getting parts of plays;"
19745,_SCHOOLS._,"The tender friendships made 'twixt heart and heart,                210"
19746,_SCHOOLS._,When the dear friends had nothing to impart:--
19747,_SCHOOLS._,All! all! are over;--now th' accomplished maid
19748,_SCHOOLS._,"Longs for the world, of nothing there afraid."
19749,_SCHOOLS._,"Dreams of delight invade her gentle breast,"
19750,_SCHOOLS._,And fancied lovers rob the heart of rest;
19751,_SCHOOLS._,"At the paternal door a carriage stands,"
19752,_SCHOOLS._,"Love knits their hearts, and Hymen joins their hands."
19753,_SCHOOLS._,"Ah!--world unknown! how charming is thy view,"
19754,_SCHOOLS._,"Thy pleasures many, and each pleasure new!"
19755,_SCHOOLS._,Ah!--world experienced! what of thee is told?                      220
19756,_SCHOOLS._,"How few thy pleasures, and those few how old!"
19757,_SCHOOLS._,"Within a silent street, and far apart"
19758,_SCHOOLS._,"From noise of business, from a quay or mart,"
19759,_SCHOOLS._,"Stands an old spacious building, and the din"
19760,_SCHOOLS._,"You hear without, explains the work within;"
19761,_SCHOOLS._,"Unlike the whispering of the nymphs, this noise"
19762,_SCHOOLS._,"Loudly proclaims a ""boarding-school for boys."""
19763,_SCHOOLS._,"The master heeds it not, for thirty years"
19764,_SCHOOLS._,Have render'd all familiar to his ears;
19765,_SCHOOLS._,"He sits in comfort, 'mid the various sound                         230"
19766,_SCHOOLS._,Of mingled tones for ever flowing round;
19767,_SCHOOLS._,Day after day he to his task attends--
19768,_SCHOOLS._,"Unvaried toil, and care that never ends."
19769,_SCHOOLS._,Boys in their works proceed; while his employ
19770,_SCHOOLS._,"Admits no change, or changes but the boy;"
19771,_SCHOOLS._,Yet time has made it easy;--he beside
19772,_SCHOOLS._,"Has power supreme, and power is sweet to pride."
19773,_SCHOOLS._,"But grant him pleasure;--what can teachers feel,"
19774,_SCHOOLS._,Dependent helpers always at the wheel?
19775,_SCHOOLS._,"Their power despised, their compensation small,                    240"
19776,_SCHOOLS._,"Their labour dull, their life laborious all;"
19777,_SCHOOLS._,"Set after set, the lower lads to make"
19778,_SCHOOLS._,Fit for the class which their superiors take;
19779,_SCHOOLS._,The road of learning for a time to track
19780,_SCHOOLS._,"In roughest state, and then again go back;"
19781,_SCHOOLS._,Just the same way on other troops to wait--
19782,_SCHOOLS._,Attendants fix'd at learning's lower gate.
19783,_SCHOOLS._,The day-tasks now are over;--to their ground
19784,_SCHOOLS._,Rush the gay crowd with joy-compelling sound;
19785,_SCHOOLS._,"Glad to [elude] the burthens of the day,                           250"
19786,_SCHOOLS._,The eager parties hurry to their play.
19787,_SCHOOLS._,Then in these hours of liberty we find
19788,_SCHOOLS._,The native bias of the opening mind;
19789,_SCHOOLS._,"They yet possess not skill the mask to place,"
19790,_SCHOOLS._,And hide the passions glowing in the face;
19791,_SCHOOLS._,"Yet some are found--the close, the sly, the mean,"
19792,_SCHOOLS._,Who know already all must not be seen.
19793,_SCHOOLS._,"Lo! one who walks apart, although so young,"
19794,_SCHOOLS._,He lays restraint upon his eye and tongue;
19795,_SCHOOLS._,"Nor will he into scrapes or dangers get,                           260"
19796,_SCHOOLS._,And half the school are in the stripling's debt.
19797,_SCHOOLS._,"Suspicious, timid, he is much afraid"
19798,_SCHOOLS._,Of trick and plot--he dreads to be betray'd;
19799,_SCHOOLS._,"He shuns all friendship, for he finds they lend,"
19800,_SCHOOLS._,When lads begin to call each other friend.
19801,_SCHOOLS._,Yet self with self has war; the tempting sight
19802,_SCHOOLS._,Of fruit on sale provokes his appetite;--
19803,_SCHOOLS._,"See! how, he walks the sweet seduction by;                           }"
19804,_SCHOOLS._,"That he is tempted, costs him first a sigh--                         }"
19805,_SCHOOLS._,"'Tis dangerous to indulge, 'tis grievous to deny!                270 }"
19806,_SCHOOLS._,"This he will choose, and whispering asks the price."
19807,_SCHOOLS._,"The purchase dreadful, but the portion nice;"
19808,_SCHOOLS._,Within the pocket he explores the pence;
19809,_SCHOOLS._,"Without, temptation strikes on either sense,"
19810,_SCHOOLS._,"The sight, the smell;--but then he thinks again"
19811,_SCHOOLS._,Of money gone! while fruit nor taste remain.
19812,_SCHOOLS._,"Meantime there comes an eager thoughtless boy,"
19813,_SCHOOLS._,Who gives the price and only feels the joy:
19814,_SCHOOLS._,"Example dire! the youthful miser stops,"
19815,_SCHOOLS._,And slowly back the treasured coinage drops.                       280
19816,_SCHOOLS._,"Heroic deed! for should he now comply,"
19817,_SCHOOLS._,Can he to-morrow's appetite deny?
19818,_SCHOOLS._,"Beside, these spendthrifts who so friendly live,"
19819,_SCHOOLS._,"Cloy'd with their purchase, will a portion give.--"
19820,_SCHOOLS._,"Here ends debate, he buttons up his store,"
19821,_SCHOOLS._,"And feels the comfort that it burns no more,"
19822,_SCHOOLS._,"Unlike to him the tyrant-boy, whose sway"
19823,_SCHOOLS._,All hearts acknowledge; him the crowds obey:
19824,_SCHOOLS._,At his command they break through every rule;
19825,_SCHOOLS._,"Whoever governs, he controls the school;                           290"
19826,_SCHOOLS._,"'Tis not the distant emperor moves their fear,"
19827,_SCHOOLS._,But the proud viceroy who is ever near.
19828,_SCHOOLS._,"Verres could do that mischief in a day,"
19829,_SCHOOLS._,"For which not Rome, in all its power, could pay;"
19830,_SCHOOLS._,"And these boy-tyrants will their slaves distress,"
19831,_SCHOOLS._,And do the wrongs no master can redress.
19832,_SCHOOLS._,The mind they load with fear; it feels disdain                       }
19833,_SCHOOLS._,For its own baseness; yet it tries in vain                           }
19834,_SCHOOLS._,To shake th' admitted power;--the coward comes again.                }
19835,_SCHOOLS._,"'Tis more than present pain these tyrants give,                    300"
19836,_SCHOOLS._,Long as we've life some strong impressions live;
19837,_SCHOOLS._,And these young ruffians in the soul will sow
19838,_SCHOOLS._,Seeds of all vices that on weakness grow.
19839,_SCHOOLS._,Hark! at his word the trembling younglings flee;
19840,_SCHOOLS._,Where he is walking none must walk but he;
19841,_SCHOOLS._,See! from the winter-fire the weak retreat;
19842,_SCHOOLS._,"His the warm corner, his the favourite seat,"
19843,_SCHOOLS._,Save when he yields it to some slave to keep
19844,_SCHOOLS._,"Awhile, then back, at his return, to creep."
19845,_SCHOOLS._,"At his command his poor dependents fly,                            310"
19846,_SCHOOLS._,And humbly bribe him as a proud ally;
19847,_SCHOOLS._,"Flatter'd by all, the notice he bestows"
19848,_SCHOOLS._,"Is gross abuse, and bantering and blows;"
19849,_SCHOOLS._,"Yet he's a dunce, and, spite of all his fame"
19850,_SCHOOLS._,"Without the desk, within he feels his shame:"
19851,_SCHOOLS._,"For there the weaker boy, who felt his scorn,"
19852,_SCHOOLS._,For him corrects the blunders of the morn;
19853,_SCHOOLS._,"And he is taught, unpleasant truth! to find"
19854,_SCHOOLS._,The trembling body has the prouder mind.
19855,_SCHOOLS._,"Hark to that shout, that burst of empty noise,                   320"
19856,_SCHOOLS._,"From a rude set of bluff, obstreperous boys;"
19857,_SCHOOLS._,"They who, like colts let loose, with vigour bound,"
19858,_SCHOOLS._,"And thoughtless spirit, o'er the beaten ground;"
19859,_SCHOOLS._,"Fearless they leap, and every youngster feels"
19860,_SCHOOLS._,His Alma active in his hands and heels.
19861,_SCHOOLS._,"These are the sons of farmers, and they come"
19862,_SCHOOLS._,With partial fondness for the joys of home;
19863,_SCHOOLS._,"Their minds are coursing in their fathers' fields,"
19864,_SCHOOLS._,And e'en the dream a lively pleasure yields;
19865,_SCHOOLS._,"They, much enduring, sit th' allotted hours,                       330"
19866,_SCHOOLS._,And o'er a grammar waste their sprightly powers;
19867,_SCHOOLS._,"They dance; but them can measured steps delight,"
19868,_SCHOOLS._,Whom horse and hounds to daring deeds excite?
19869,_SCHOOLS._,"Nor could they bare to wait from meal to meal,"
19870,_SCHOOLS._,"Did they not slyly to the chamber steal,"
19871,_SCHOOLS._,"And there the produce of the basket seize,"
19872,_SCHOOLS._,The mother's gift! still studious of their ease.
19873,_SCHOOLS._,"Poor Alma, thus oppress'd, forbears to rise,"
19874,_SCHOOLS._,But rests or revels in the arms and thighs[72].
19875,_SCHOOLS._,"""But is it sure that study will repay                            340"
19876,_SCHOOLS._,"The more attentive and forbearing?""--Nay!"
19877,_SCHOOLS._,"The farm, the ship, the humble shop have each"
19878,_SCHOOLS._,Gains which severest studies seldom reach.
19879,_SCHOOLS._,"At college place a youth, who means to raise"
19880,_SCHOOLS._,His state by merit and his name by praise;
19881,_SCHOOLS._,Still much he hazards; there is serious strife
19882,_SCHOOLS._,In the contentions of a scholar's life.
19883,_SCHOOLS._,"Not all the mind's attention, care, distress,"
19884,_SCHOOLS._,"Nor diligence itself, ensure success;"
19885,_SCHOOLS._,"His jealous heart a rival's power may dread,                       350"
19886,_SCHOOLS._,"Till its strong feelings have confused his head,"
19887,_SCHOOLS._,"And, after days and months, nay, years of pain,"
19888,_SCHOOLS._,He finds just lost the object he would gain.
19889,_SCHOOLS._,"But, grant him this and all such life can give,"
19890,_SCHOOLS._,For other prospects he begins to live;
19891,_SCHOOLS._,Begins to feel that man was form'd to look
19892,_SCHOOLS._,And long for other objects than a book.
19893,_SCHOOLS._,"In his mind's eye his house and glebe he sees,"
19894,_SCHOOLS._,And farms and talks with farmers at his ease;
19895,_SCHOOLS._,"And time is lost, till fortune sends him forth                     360"
19896,_SCHOOLS._,To a rude world unconscious of his worth;
19897,_SCHOOLS._,"There in some petty parish to reside,"
19898,_SCHOOLS._,"The college-boast, then turn'd the village-guide;"
19899,_SCHOOLS._,"And, though awhile his flock and dairy please,"
19900,_SCHOOLS._,He soon reverts to former joys and ease:
19901,_SCHOOLS._,"Glad when a friend shall come to break his rest,"
19902,_SCHOOLS._,And speak of all the pleasures they possess'd--
19903,_SCHOOLS._,"Of masters, fellows, tutors, all with whom"
19904,_SCHOOLS._,"They shared those pleasures, never more to come;"
19905,_SCHOOLS._,"Till both conceive the times by bliss endear'd,                    370"
19906,_SCHOOLS._,Which once so dismal and so dull appear'd.
19907,_SCHOOLS._,"But fix our scholar, and suppose him crown'd"
19908,_SCHOOLS._,With all the glory gain'd on classic ground;
19909,_SCHOOLS._,"Suppose the world without a sigh resign'd,"
19910,_SCHOOLS._,And to his college all his care confined;
19911,_SCHOOLS._,"Give him all honours that such states allow,"
19912,_SCHOOLS._,The freshman's terror and the tradesman's bow;
19913,_SCHOOLS._,"Let his apartments with his taste agree,"
19914,_SCHOOLS._,And all his views be those he loves to see;
19915,_SCHOOLS._,"Let him each day behold the savoury treat,                         380"
19916,_SCHOOLS._,"For which he pays not, but is paid to eat;"
19917,_SCHOOLS._,"These joys and glories soon delight no more,"
19918,_SCHOOLS._,"Although, withheld, the mind is vex'd and sore;"
19919,_SCHOOLS._,The honour too is to the place confined;
19920,_SCHOOLS._,Abroad they know not each superior mind:
19921,_SCHOOLS._,"Strangers no _wranglers_ in these figures see,"
19922,_SCHOOLS._,Nor give they worship to a high degree.
19923,_SCHOOLS._,"Unlike the prophet's is the scholar's case,"
19924,_SCHOOLS._,His honour all is in his dwelling-place;
19925,_SCHOOLS._,And there such honours are familiar things;                        390
19926,_SCHOOLS._,What is a monarch in a crowd of kings?
19927,_SCHOOLS._,"Like other sovereigns he's by forms address'd,"
19928,_SCHOOLS._,By statutes govern'd and with rules oppress'd.
19929,_SCHOOLS._,"When all these forms and duties die away,"
19930,_SCHOOLS._,"And the day passes like the former day,"
19931,_SCHOOLS._,"Then, of exterior things at once bereft,"
19932,_SCHOOLS._,He's to himself and one attendant left;
19933,_SCHOOLS._,"Nay, John too goes; nor aught of service more"
19934,_SCHOOLS._,"Remains for him; he gladly quits the door,"
19935,_SCHOOLS._,"And, as he whistles to the college-gate,                           400"
19936,_SCHOOLS._,He kindly pities his poor master's fate.
19937,_SCHOOLS._,"Books cannot always please, however good;"
19938,_SCHOOLS._,Minds are not ever craving for their food;
19939,_SCHOOLS._,But sleep will soon the weary soul prepare
19940,_SCHOOLS._,For cares to-morrow that were this day's care;
19941,_SCHOOLS._,"For forms, for feasts, that sundry times have past,"
19942,_SCHOOLS._,And formal feasts that will for ever last.
19943,_SCHOOLS._,"""But then from study will no comforts rise?"""
19944,_SCHOOLS._,Yes! such as studious minds alone can prize;
19945,_SCHOOLS._,"Comforts, yea! joys ineffable they find,                           410"
19946,_SCHOOLS._,Who seek the prouder pleasures of the mind:
19947,_SCHOOLS._,"The soul, collected in those happy hours,"
19948,_SCHOOLS._,"Then makes her efforts, then enjoys her powers;"
19949,_SCHOOLS._,"And in those seasons feels herself repaid,"
19950,_SCHOOLS._,For labours past and honours long delay'd.
19951,_SCHOOLS._,"No! 'tis not worldly gain, although by chance"
19952,_SCHOOLS._,The sons of learning may to wealth advance;
19953,_SCHOOLS._,"Nor station high, though in some favouring hour"
19954,_SCHOOLS._,The sons of learning may arrive at power;
19955,_SCHOOLS._,"Nor is it glory, though the public voice                           420"
19956,_SCHOOLS._,Of honest praise will make the heart rejoice;
19957,_SCHOOLS._,"But 'tis the mind's own feelings give the joy,"
19958,_SCHOOLS._,Pleasures she gathers in her own employ--
19959,_SCHOOLS._,"Pleasures that gain or praise cannot bestow,"
19960,_SCHOOLS._,Yet can dilate and raise them when they flow.
19961,_SCHOOLS._,"For this the poet looks the world around,"
19962,_SCHOOLS._,Where form and life and reasoning man are found.
19963,_SCHOOLS._,"He loves the mind in all its modes to trace,"
19964,_SCHOOLS._,And all the manners of the changing race;
19965,_SCHOOLS._,"Silent he walks the road of life along,                            430"
19966,_SCHOOLS._,And views the aims of its tumultuous throng;
19967,_SCHOOLS._,"He finds what shapes the Proteus-passions take,"
19968,_SCHOOLS._,"And what strange waste of life and joy they make,"
19969,_SCHOOLS._,"And loves to show them in their varied ways,"
19970,_SCHOOLS._,With honest blame or with unflattering praise.
19971,_SCHOOLS._,"'Tis good to know, 'tis pleasant to impart,"
19972,_SCHOOLS._,These turns and movements of the human heart;
19973,_SCHOOLS._,"The stronger features of the soul to paint,"
19974,_SCHOOLS._,And make distinct the latent and the faint;
19975,_SCHOOLS._,"Man as he is, to place in all men's view,                          440"
19976,_SCHOOLS._,"Yet none with rancour, none with scorn pursue;"
19977,_SCHOOLS._,"Nor be it ever of my portraits told,--"
19978,_SCHOOLS._,"""Here the strong lines of malice we behold.""--"

19984,_SCHOOLS._,"""This is a likeness,"" may they all declare,"
19985,_SCHOOLS._,"""And I have seen him, but I know not where;"""
19986,_SCHOOLS._,"For I should mourn the mischief I had done,"
19987,_SCHOOLS._,If as the likeness all would fix on one.
19988,_SCHOOLS._,"Man's vice and crime I combat as I can,                          450"
19989,_SCHOOLS._,But to his GOD and conscience leave the man;
19990,_SCHOOLS._,"I search (a [Quixote!]) all the land about,"
19991,_SCHOOLS._,"To find its giants and enchanters out,"
19992,_SCHOOLS._,"(The giant-folly, the enchanter-vice,"
19993,_SCHOOLS._,Whom doubtless I shall vanquish in a trice;)
19994,_SCHOOLS._,But is there man whom I would injure?--no!
19995,_SCHOOLS._,"I am to him a fellow, not a foe--"
19996,_SCHOOLS._,"A fellow-sinner, who must rather dread"
19997,_SCHOOLS._,"The bolt, than hurl it at another's head."
19998,_SCHOOLS._,"No! let the guiltless, if there such be found,                   460"
19999,_SCHOOLS._,"Launch forth the spear, and deal the deadly wound;"
20000,_SCHOOLS._,"How can I so the cause of virtue aid,"
20001,_SCHOOLS._,Who am myself attainted and afraid?
20002,_SCHOOLS._,"Yet, as I can, I point the powers of rhyme,"
20003,_SCHOOLS._,"And, sparing criminals, attack the crime."
