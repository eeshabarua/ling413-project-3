348,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Laura bowed her head to hear,"
349,GOBLIN MARKET.,Lizzie veiled her blushes:
350,GOBLIN MARKET.,Crouching close together
351,GOBLIN MARKET.,"In the cooling weather,"
352,GOBLIN MARKET.,"With clasping arms and cautioning lips,"
353,GOBLIN MARKET.,With tingling cheeks and finger-tips.
354,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Lie close,"" Laura said,"
355,GOBLIN MARKET.,Pricking up her golden head:
356,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""We must not look at goblin men,"
357,GOBLIN MARKET.,We must not buy their fruits:
358,GOBLIN MARKET.,Who knows upon what soil they fed
359,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Their hungry thirsty roots?"""
360,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Come buy,"" call the goblins"
361,GOBLIN MARKET.,Hobbling down the glen.
362,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""O,"" cried Lizzie, ""Laura, Laura,"
363,GOBLIN MARKET.,"You should not peep at goblin men."""
364,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Lizzie covered up her eyes,"
365,GOBLIN MARKET.,Covered close lest they should look;
366,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Laura reared her glossy head,"
367,GOBLIN MARKET.,And whispered like the restless brook:
368,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,"
369,GOBLIN MARKET.,Down the glen tramp little men.
370,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One hauls a basket,"
371,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One bears a plate,"
372,GOBLIN MARKET.,One lugs a golden dish
373,GOBLIN MARKET.,Of many pounds' weight.
374,GOBLIN MARKET.,How fair the vine must grow
375,GOBLIN MARKET.,Whose grapes are so luscious;
376,GOBLIN MARKET.,How warm the wind must blow
377,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Through those fruit bushes."""
378,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""No,"" said Lizzie, ""no, no, no;"
379,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Their offers should not charm us,"
380,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Their evil gifts would harm us."""
381,GOBLIN MARKET.,She thrust a dimpled finger
382,GOBLIN MARKET.,"In each ear, shut eyes and ran:"
383,GOBLIN MARKET.,Curious Laura chose to linger
384,GOBLIN MARKET.,Wondering at each merchant man.
385,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One had a cat's face,"
386,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One whisked a tail,"
387,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One tramped at a rat's pace,"
388,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One crawled like a snail,"
389,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry,"
390,GOBLIN MARKET.,One like a ratel tumbled hurry-scurry.
391,GOBLIN MARKET.,She heard a voice like voice of doves
392,GOBLIN MARKET.,Cooing all together:
393,GOBLIN MARKET.,They sounded kind and full of loves
394,GOBLIN MARKET.,In the pleasant weather.
395,GOBLIN MARKET.,
396,GOBLIN MARKET.,Laura stretched her gleaming neck
397,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Like a rush-imbedded swan,"
398,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Like a lily from the beck,"
399,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Like a moonlit poplar branch,"
400,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like a vessel at the launch
401,GOBLIN MARKET.,When its last restraint is gone.
402,GOBLIN MARKET.,
403,GOBLIN MARKET.,Backwards up the mossy glen
404,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Turned and trooped the goblin men,"
405,GOBLIN MARKET.,"With their shrill repeated cry,"
406,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Come buy, come buy."""
407,GOBLIN MARKET.,When they reached where Laura was
408,GOBLIN MARKET.,"They stood stock still upon the moss,"
409,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Leering at each other,"
410,GOBLIN MARKET.,Brother with queer brother;
411,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Signalling each other,"
412,GOBLIN MARKET.,Brother with sly brother.
413,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One set his basket down,"
414,GOBLIN MARKET.,One reared his plate;
415,GOBLIN MARKET.,One began to weave a crown
416,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown"
417,GOBLIN MARKET.,(Men sell not such in any town);
418,GOBLIN MARKET.,One heaved the golden weight
419,GOBLIN MARKET.,Of dish and fruit to offer her:
420,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Come buy, come buy,"" was still their cry."
421,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Laura stared but did not stir,"
422,GOBLIN MARKET.,Longed but had no money:
423,GOBLIN MARKET.,The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste
424,GOBLIN MARKET.,"In tones as smooth as honey,"
425,GOBLIN MARKET.,"The cat-faced purr'd,"
426,GOBLIN MARKET.,The rat-paced spoke a word
427,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;"
428,GOBLIN MARKET.,One parrot-voiced and jolly
429,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Cried ""Pretty Goblin"" still for ""Pretty Polly"";--"
430,GOBLIN MARKET.,One whistled like a bird.
431,GOBLIN MARKET.,
432,GOBLIN MARKET.,But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:
433,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Good folk, I have no coin;"
434,GOBLIN MARKET.,To take were to purloin:
435,GOBLIN MARKET.,"I have no copper in my purse,"
436,GOBLIN MARKET.,"I have no silver either,"
437,GOBLIN MARKET.,And all my gold is on the furze
438,GOBLIN MARKET.,That shakes in windy weather
439,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Above the rusty heather."""
440,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""You have much gold upon your head,"""
441,GOBLIN MARKET.,They answered altogether:
442,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Buy from us with a golden curl."""
443,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She clipped a precious golden lock,"
444,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She dropped a tear more rare than pearl,"
445,GOBLIN MARKET.,Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red:
446,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Sweeter than honey from the rock,"
447,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,"
448,GOBLIN MARKET.,Clearer than water flowed that juice;
449,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She never tasted such before,"
450,GOBLIN MARKET.,How should it cloy with length of use?
451,GOBLIN MARKET.,She sucked and sucked and sucked the more
452,GOBLIN MARKET.,Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;
453,GOBLIN MARKET.,She sucked until her lips were sore;
454,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Then flung the emptied rinds away,"
455,GOBLIN MARKET.,"But gathered up one kernel stone,"
456,GOBLIN MARKET.,And knew not was it night or day
457,GOBLIN MARKET.,As she turned home alone.
458,GOBLIN MARKET.,
459,GOBLIN MARKET.,Lizzie met her at the gate
460,GOBLIN MARKET.,Full of wise upbraidings:
461,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Dear, you should not stay so late,"
462,GOBLIN MARKET.,Twilight is not good for maidens;
463,GOBLIN MARKET.,Should not loiter in the glen
464,GOBLIN MARKET.,In the haunts of goblin men.
465,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Do you not remember Jeanie,"
466,GOBLIN MARKET.,"How she met them in the moonlight,"
467,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Took their gifts both choice and many,"
468,GOBLIN MARKET.,Ate their fruits and wore their flowers
469,GOBLIN MARKET.,Plucked from bowers
470,GOBLIN MARKET.,Where summer ripens at all hours?
471,GOBLIN MARKET.,But ever in the noonlight
472,GOBLIN MARKET.,She pined and pined away;
473,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Sought them by night and day,"
474,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Found them no more, but dwindled and grew gray,"
475,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Then fell with the first snow,"
476,GOBLIN MARKET.,While to this day no grass will grow
477,GOBLIN MARKET.,Where she lies low:
478,GOBLIN MARKET.,I planted daisies there a year ago
479,GOBLIN MARKET.,That never blow.
480,GOBLIN MARKET.,"You should not loiter so."""
481,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Nay, hush,"" said Laura:"
482,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Nay, hush, my sister:"
483,GOBLIN MARKET.,"I ate and ate my fill,"
484,GOBLIN MARKET.,Yet my mouth waters still;
485,GOBLIN MARKET.,To-morrow night I will
486,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Buy more,""--and kissed her."
487,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Have done with sorrow;"
488,GOBLIN MARKET.,I'll bring you plums to-morrow
489,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Fresh on their mother twigs,"
490,GOBLIN MARKET.,Cherries worth getting;
491,GOBLIN MARKET.,You cannot think what figs
492,GOBLIN MARKET.,"My teeth have met in,"
493,GOBLIN MARKET.,What melons icy-cold
494,GOBLIN MARKET.,Piled on a dish of gold
495,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Too huge for me to hold,"
496,GOBLIN MARKET.,"What peaches with a velvet nap,"
497,GOBLIN MARKET.,Pellucid grapes without one seed:
498,GOBLIN MARKET.,Odorous indeed must be the mead
499,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink,"
500,GOBLIN MARKET.,"With lilies at the brink,"
501,GOBLIN MARKET.,"And sugar-sweet their sap."""
502,GOBLIN MARKET.,
503,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Golden head by golden head,"
504,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like two pigeons in one nest
505,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Folded in each other's wings,"
506,GOBLIN MARKET.,They lay down in their curtained bed:
507,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Like two blossoms on one stem,"
508,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Like two flakes of new-fallen snow,"
509,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like two wands of ivory
510,GOBLIN MARKET.,Tipped with gold for awful kings.
511,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Moon and stars gazed in at them,"
512,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Wind sang to them lullaby,"
513,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Lumbering owls forbore to fly,"
514,GOBLIN MARKET.,Not a bat flapped to and fro
515,GOBLIN MARKET.,Round their rest:
516,GOBLIN MARKET.,Cheek to cheek and breast to breast
517,GOBLIN MARKET.,Locked together in one nest.
518,GOBLIN MARKET.,
519,GOBLIN MARKET.,Early in the morning
520,GOBLIN MARKET.,"When the first cock crowed his warning,"
521,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,"
522,GOBLIN MARKET.,Laura rose with Lizzie:
523,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Fetched in honey, milked the cows,"
524,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Aired and set to rights the house,"
525,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,"
526,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,"
527,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Next churned butter, whipped up cream,"
528,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Fed their poultry, sat and sewed;"
529,GOBLIN MARKET.,Talked as modest maidens should:
530,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Lizzie with an open heart,"
531,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Laura in an absent dream,"
532,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One content, one sick in part;"
533,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One warbling for the mere bright day's delight,"
534,GOBLIN MARKET.,One longing for the night.
535,GOBLIN MARKET.,
536,GOBLIN MARKET.,At length slow evening came:
537,GOBLIN MARKET.,They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;
538,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Lizzie most placid in her look,"
539,GOBLIN MARKET.,Laura most like a leaping flame.
540,GOBLIN MARKET.,They drew the gurgling water from its deep;
541,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Lizzie plucked purple and rich golden flags,"
542,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Then turning homeward said: ""The sunset flushes"
543,GOBLIN MARKET.,Those furthest loftiest crags;
544,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Come, Laura, not another maiden lags,"
545,GOBLIN MARKET.,"No wilful squirrel wags,"
546,GOBLIN MARKET.,"The beasts and birds are fast asleep."""
547,GOBLIN MARKET.,But Laura loitered still among the rushes
548,GOBLIN MARKET.,And said the bank was steep.
549,GOBLIN MARKET.,
550,GOBLIN MARKET.,"And said the hour was early still,"
551,GOBLIN MARKET.,"The dew not fallen, the wind not chill:"
552,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Listening ever, but not catching"
553,GOBLIN MARKET.,"The customary cry,"
554,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Come buy, come buy,"""
555,GOBLIN MARKET.,With its iterated jingle
556,GOBLIN MARKET.,Of sugar-baited words:
557,GOBLIN MARKET.,Not for all her watching
558,GOBLIN MARKET.,Once discerning even one goblin
559,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;"
560,GOBLIN MARKET.,Let alone the herds
561,GOBLIN MARKET.,"That used to tramp along the glen,"
562,GOBLIN MARKET.,"In groups or single,"
563,GOBLIN MARKET.,Of brisk fruit-merchant men.
564,GOBLIN MARKET.,
565,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Till Lizzie urged: ""O Laura, come;"
566,GOBLIN MARKET.,"I hear the fruit-call, but I dare not look:"
567,GOBLIN MARKET.,You should not loiter longer at this brook:
568,GOBLIN MARKET.,Come with me home.
569,GOBLIN MARKET.,"The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,"
570,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Each glow-worm winks her spark,"
571,GOBLIN MARKET.,Let us get home before the night grows dark;
572,GOBLIN MARKET.,For clouds may gather
573,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Though this is summer weather,"
574,GOBLIN MARKET.,Put out the lights and drench us through;
575,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Then if we lost our way what should we do?"""
576,GOBLIN MARKET.,
577,GOBLIN MARKET.,Laura turned cold as stone
578,GOBLIN MARKET.,"To find her sister heard that cry alone,"
579,GOBLIN MARKET.,"That goblin cry,"
580,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Come buy our fruits, come buy."""
581,GOBLIN MARKET.,Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?
582,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Must she no more such succous pasture find,"
583,GOBLIN MARKET.,Gone deaf and blind?
584,GOBLIN MARKET.,Her tree of life drooped from the root:
585,GOBLIN MARKET.,She said not one word in her heart's sore ache;
586,GOBLIN MARKET.,"But peering thro' the dimness, naught discerning,"
587,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way;"
588,GOBLIN MARKET.,"So crept to bed, and lay"
589,GOBLIN MARKET.,Silent till Lizzie slept;
590,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Then sat up in a passionate yearning,"
591,GOBLIN MARKET.,"And gnashed her teeth for balked desire, and wept"
592,GOBLIN MARKET.,As if her heart would break.
593,GOBLIN MARKET.,
594,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Day after day, night after night,"
595,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Laura kept watch in vain,"
596,GOBLIN MARKET.,In sullen silence of exceeding pain.
597,GOBLIN MARKET.,She never caught again the goblin cry:
598,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Come buy, come buy"";--"
599,GOBLIN MARKET.,She never spied the goblin men
600,GOBLIN MARKET.,Hawking their fruits along the glen:
601,GOBLIN MARKET.,But when the noon waxed bright
602,GOBLIN MARKET.,Her hair grew thin and gray;
603,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn"
604,GOBLIN MARKET.,"To swift decay, and burn"
605,GOBLIN MARKET.,Her fire away.
606,GOBLIN MARKET.,
607,GOBLIN MARKET.,One day remembering her kernel-stone
608,GOBLIN MARKET.,She set it by a wall that faced the south;
609,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root,"
610,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Watched for a waxing shoot,"
611,GOBLIN MARKET.,But there came none;
612,GOBLIN MARKET.,"It never saw the sun,"
613,GOBLIN MARKET.,It never felt the trickling moisture run:
614,GOBLIN MARKET.,While with sunk eyes and faded mouth
615,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She dreamed of melons, as a traveller sees"
616,GOBLIN MARKET.,False waves in desert drouth
617,GOBLIN MARKET.,"With shade of leaf-crowned trees,"
618,GOBLIN MARKET.,And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.
619,GOBLIN MARKET.,
620,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She no more swept the house,"
621,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Tended the fowls or cows,"
622,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Fetched honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,"
623,GOBLIN MARKET.,Brought water from the brook:
624,GOBLIN MARKET.,But sat down listless in the chimney-nook
625,GOBLIN MARKET.,And would not eat.
626,GOBLIN MARKET.,
627,GOBLIN MARKET.,Tender Lizzie could not bear
628,GOBLIN MARKET.,"To watch her sister's cankerous care,"
629,GOBLIN MARKET.,Yet not to share.
630,GOBLIN MARKET.,She night and morning
631,GOBLIN MARKET.,Caught the goblins' cry:
632,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Come buy our orchard fruits,"
633,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Come buy, come buy."""
634,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Beside the brook, along the glen,"
635,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She heard the tramp of goblin men,"
636,GOBLIN MARKET.,The voice and stir
637,GOBLIN MARKET.,Poor Laura could not hear;
638,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Longed to buy fruit to comfort her,"
639,GOBLIN MARKET.,But feared to pay too dear.
640,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She thought of Jeanie in her grave,"
641,GOBLIN MARKET.,Who should have been a bride;
642,GOBLIN MARKET.,But who for joys brides hope to have
643,GOBLIN MARKET.,Fell sick and died
644,GOBLIN MARKET.,"In her gay prime,"
645,GOBLIN MARKET.,"In earliest winter-time,"
646,GOBLIN MARKET.,"With the first glazing rime,"
647,GOBLIN MARKET.,With the first snow-fall of crisp winter-time.
648,GOBLIN MARKET.,
649,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Till Laura, dwindling,"
650,GOBLIN MARKET.,Seemed knocking at Death's door:
651,GOBLIN MARKET.,Then Lizzie weighed no more
652,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Better and worse,"
653,GOBLIN MARKET.,"But put a silver penny in her purse,"
654,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Kissed Laura, crossed the heath with clumps of furze"
655,GOBLIN MARKET.,"At twilight, halted by the brook;"
656,GOBLIN MARKET.,And for the first time in her life
657,GOBLIN MARKET.,Began to listen and look.
658,GOBLIN MARKET.,
659,GOBLIN MARKET.,Laughed every goblin
660,GOBLIN MARKET.,When they spied her peeping:
661,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Came towards her hobbling,"
662,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Flying, running, leaping,"
663,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Puffing and blowing,"
664,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Chuckling, clapping, crowing,"
665,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Clucking and gobbling,"
666,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Mopping and mowing,"
667,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Full of airs and graces,"
668,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Pulling wry faces,"
669,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Demure grimaces,"
670,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Cat-like and rat-like,"
671,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Ratel and wombat-like,"
672,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Snail-paced in a hurry,"
673,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Parrot-voiced and whistler,"
674,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Helter-skelter, hurry-skurry,"
675,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Chattering like magpies,"
676,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Fluttering like pigeons,"
677,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Gliding like fishes,--"
678,GOBLIN MARKET.,Hugged her and kissed her;
679,GOBLIN MARKET.,Squeezed and caressed her;
680,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Stretched up their dishes,"
681,GOBLIN MARKET.,Panniers and plates:
682,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Look at our apples"
683,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Russet and dun,"
684,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Bob at our cherries,"
685,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Bite at our peaches,"
686,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Citrons and dates,"
687,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Grapes for the asking,"
688,GOBLIN MARKET.,Pears red with basking
689,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Out in the sun,"
690,GOBLIN MARKET.,Plums on their twigs;
691,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Pluck them and suck them,"
692,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Pomegranates, figs."""
693,GOBLIN MARKET.,
694,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Good folk,"" said Lizzie,"
695,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Mindful of Jeanie,"
696,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Give me much and many"";--"
697,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Held out her apron,"
698,GOBLIN MARKET.,Tossed them her penny.
699,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Nay, take a seat with us,"
700,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Honor and eat with us,"""
701,GOBLIN MARKET.,They answered grinning:
702,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Our feast is but beginning."
703,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Night yet is early,"
704,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Warm and dew-pearly,"
705,GOBLIN MARKET.,Wakeful and starry:
706,GOBLIN MARKET.,Such fruits as these
707,GOBLIN MARKET.,No man can carry;
708,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Half their bloom would fly,"
709,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Half their dew would dry,"
710,GOBLIN MARKET.,Half their flavor would pass by.
711,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Sit down and feast with us,"
712,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Be welcome guest with us,"
713,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Cheer you and rest with us."""
714,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Thank you,"" said Lizzie; ""but one waits"
715,GOBLIN MARKET.,At home alone for me:
716,GOBLIN MARKET.,"So, without further parleying,"
717,GOBLIN MARKET.,If you will not sell me any
718,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Of your fruits though much and many,"
719,GOBLIN MARKET.,Give me back my silver penny
720,GOBLIN MARKET.,"I tossed you for a fee."""
721,GOBLIN MARKET.,"They began to scratch their pates,"
722,GOBLIN MARKET.,"No longer wagging, purring,"
723,GOBLIN MARKET.,"But visibly demurring,"
724,GOBLIN MARKET.,Grunting and snarling.
725,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One called her proud,"
726,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Cross-grained, uncivil;"
727,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Their tones waxed loud,"
728,GOBLIN MARKET.,Their looks were evil.
729,GOBLIN MARKET.,Lashing their tails
730,GOBLIN MARKET.,"They trod and hustled her,"
731,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Elbowed and jostled her,"
732,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Clawed with their nails,"
733,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,"
734,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Tore her gown and soiled her stocking,"
735,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Twitched her hair out by the roots,"
736,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Stamped upon her tender feet,"
737,GOBLIN MARKET.,Held her hands and squeezed their fruits
738,GOBLIN MARKET.,Against her mouth to make her eat.
739,GOBLIN MARKET.,
740,GOBLIN MARKET.,"White and golden Lizzie stood,"
741,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Like a lily in a flood,--"
742,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like a rock of blue-veined stone
743,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Lashed by tides obstreperously,--"
744,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like a beacon left alone
745,GOBLIN MARKET.,"In a hoary roaring sea,"
746,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Sending up a golden fire,--"
747,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like a fruit-crowned orange-tree
748,GOBLIN MARKET.,White with blossoms honey-sweet
749,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Sore beset by wasp and bee,--"
750,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like a royal virgin town
751,GOBLIN MARKET.,Topped with gilded dome and spire
752,GOBLIN MARKET.,Close beleaguered by a fleet
753,GOBLIN MARKET.,Mad to tug her standard down.
754,GOBLIN MARKET.,
755,GOBLIN MARKET.,"One may lead a horse to water,"
756,GOBLIN MARKET.,Twenty cannot make him drink.
757,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Though the goblins cuffed and caught her,"
758,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Coaxed and fought her,"
759,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Bullied and besought her,"
760,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Scratched her, pinched her black as ink,"
761,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Kicked and knocked her,"
762,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Mauled and mocked her,"
763,GOBLIN MARKET.,Lizzie uttered not a word;
764,GOBLIN MARKET.,Would not open lip from lip
765,GOBLIN MARKET.,Lest they should cram a mouthful in;
766,GOBLIN MARKET.,But laughed in heart to feel the drip
767,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Of juice that syrupped all her face,"
768,GOBLIN MARKET.,"And lodged in dimples of her chin,"
769,GOBLIN MARKET.,And streaked her neck which quaked like curd.
770,GOBLIN MARKET.,"At last the evil people,"
771,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Worn out by her resistance,"
772,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Flung back her penny, kicked their fruit"
773,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Along whichever road they took,"
774,GOBLIN MARKET.,Not leaving root or stone or shoot.
775,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Some writhed into the ground,"
776,GOBLIN MARKET.,Some dived into the brook
777,GOBLIN MARKET.,"With ring and ripple,"
778,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Some scudded on the gale without a sound,"
779,GOBLIN MARKET.,Some vanished in the distance.
780,GOBLIN MARKET.,
781,GOBLIN MARKET.,"In a smart, ache, tingle,"
782,GOBLIN MARKET.,Lizzie went her way;
783,GOBLIN MARKET.,Knew not was it night or day;
784,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Sprang up the bank, tore through the furze,"
785,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Threaded copse and dingle,"
786,GOBLIN MARKET.,And heard her penny jingle
787,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Bouncing in her purse,--"
788,GOBLIN MARKET.,Its bounce was music to her ear.
789,GOBLIN MARKET.,She ran and ran
790,GOBLIN MARKET.,As if she feared some goblin man
791,GOBLIN MARKET.,Dogged her with gibe or curse
792,GOBLIN MARKET.,Or something worse:
793,GOBLIN MARKET.,"But not one goblin skurried after,"
794,GOBLIN MARKET.,Nor was she pricked by fear;
795,GOBLIN MARKET.,The kind heart made her windy-paced
796,GOBLIN MARKET.,That urged her home quite out of breath with haste
797,GOBLIN MARKET.,And inward laughter.
798,GOBLIN MARKET.,
799,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She cried ""Laura,"" up the garden,"
800,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Did you miss me?"
801,GOBLIN MARKET.,Come and kiss me.
802,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Never mind my bruises,"
803,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices"
804,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Squeezed from goblin fruits for you,"
805,GOBLIN MARKET.,Goblin pulp and goblin dew.
806,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Eat me, drink me, love me;"
807,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Laura, make much of me:"
808,GOBLIN MARKET.,For your sake I have braved the glen
809,GOBLIN MARKET.,"And had to do with goblin merchant men."""
810,GOBLIN MARKET.,
811,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Laura started from her chair,"
812,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Flung her arms up in the air,"
813,GOBLIN MARKET.,Clutched her hair:
814,GOBLIN MARKET.,"""Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted"
815,GOBLIN MARKET.,For my sake the fruit forbidden?
816,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Must your light like mine be hidden,"
817,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Your young life like mine be wasted,"
818,GOBLIN MARKET.,Undone in mine undoing
819,GOBLIN MARKET.,"And ruined in my ruin,"
820,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Thirsty, cankered, goblin-ridden?"""
821,GOBLIN MARKET.,"She clung about her sister,"
822,GOBLIN MARKET.,Kissed and kissed and kissed her:
823,GOBLIN MARKET.,Tears once again
824,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Refreshed her shrunken eyes,"
825,GOBLIN MARKET.,Dropping like rain
826,GOBLIN MARKET.,After long sultry drouth;
827,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,"
828,GOBLIN MARKET.,She kissed and kissed her with a hungry mouth.
829,GOBLIN MARKET.,
830,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Her lips began to scorch,"
831,GOBLIN MARKET.,"That juice was wormwood to her tongue,"
832,GOBLIN MARKET.,She loathed the feast:
833,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Writhing as one possessed she leaped and sung,"
834,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Rent all her robe, and wrung"
835,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Her hands in lamentable haste,"
836,GOBLIN MARKET.,And beat her breast.
837,GOBLIN MARKET.,Her locks streamed like the torch
838,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Borne by a racer at full speed,"
839,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Or like the mane of horses in their flight,"
840,GOBLIN MARKET.,Or like an eagle when she stems the light
841,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Straight toward the sun,"
842,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Or like a caged thing freed,"
843,GOBLIN MARKET.,Or like a flying flag when armies run.
844,GOBLIN MARKET.,
845,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Swift fire spread through her veins, knocked at her heart,"
846,GOBLIN MARKET.,Met the fire smouldering there
847,GOBLIN MARKET.,And overbore its lesser flame;
848,GOBLIN MARKET.,She gorged on bitterness without a name:
849,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Ah! fool, to choose such part"
850,GOBLIN MARKET.,Of soul-consuming care!
851,GOBLIN MARKET.,Sense failed in the mortal strife:
852,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like the watch-tower of a town
853,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Which an earthquake shatters down,"
854,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Like a lightning-stricken mast,"
855,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like a wind-uprooted tree
856,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Spun about,"
857,GOBLIN MARKET.,Like a foam-topped water-spout
858,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Cast down headlong in the sea,"
859,GOBLIN MARKET.,She fell at last;
860,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Pleasure past and anguish past,"
861,GOBLIN MARKET.,Is it death or is it life?
862,GOBLIN MARKET.,
863,GOBLIN MARKET.,Life out of death.
864,GOBLIN MARKET.,"That night long Lizzie watched by her,"
865,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Counted her pulse's flagging stir,"
866,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Felt for her breath,"
867,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Held water to her lips, and cooled her face"
868,GOBLIN MARKET.,With tears and fanning leaves:
869,GOBLIN MARKET.,"But when the first birds chirped about their eaves,"
870,GOBLIN MARKET.,And early reapers plodded to the place
871,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Of golden sheaves,"
872,GOBLIN MARKET.,And dew-wet grass
873,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Bowed in the morning winds so brisk to pass,"
874,GOBLIN MARKET.,And new buds with new day
875,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Opened of cup-like lilies on the stream,"
876,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Laura awoke as from a dream,"
877,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Laughed in the innocent old way,"
878,GOBLIN MARKET.,Hugged Lizzie but not twice or thrice;
879,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Her gleaming locks showed not one thread of gray,"
880,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Her breath was sweet as May,"
881,GOBLIN MARKET.,And light danced in her eyes.
882,GOBLIN MARKET.,
883,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Days, weeks, months, years"
884,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Afterwards, when both were wives"
885,GOBLIN MARKET.,With children of their own;
886,GOBLIN MARKET.,"Their mother-hearts beset with fears,"
887,GOBLIN MARKET.,Their lives bound up in tender lives;

1455,MY DREAM.,MY DREAM.
1456,MY DREAM.,
1457,MY DREAM.,
1458,MY DREAM.,"Hear now a curious dream I dreamed last night,"
1459,MY DREAM.,Each word whereof is weighed and sifted truth.
1460,MY DREAM.,
1461,MY DREAM.,I stood beside Euphrates while it swelled
1462,MY DREAM.,Like overflowing Jordan in its youth:
1463,MY DREAM.,"It waxed and colored sensibly to sight,"
1464,MY DREAM.,Till out of myriad pregnant waves there welled
1465,MY DREAM.,"Young crocodiles, a gaunt blunt-featured crew,"
1466,MY DREAM.,Fresh-hatched perhaps and daubed with birthday dew.
1467,MY DREAM.,"The rest if I should tell, I fear my friend,"
1468,MY DREAM.,"My closest friend, would deem the facts untrue;"
1469,MY DREAM.,And therefore it were wisely left untold;
1470,MY DREAM.,"Yet if you will, why, hear it to the end."
1471,MY DREAM.,
1472,MY DREAM.,Each crocodile was girt with massive gold
1473,MY DREAM.,"And polished stones, that with their wearers grew:"
1474,MY DREAM.,"But one there was who waxed beyond the rest,"
1475,MY DREAM.,"Wore kinglier girdle and a kingly crown,"
1476,MY DREAM.,Whilst crowns and orbs and sceptres starred his breast.
1477,MY DREAM.,"All gleamed compact and green with scale on scale,"
1478,MY DREAM.,"But special burnishment adorned his mail,"
1479,MY DREAM.,And special terror weighed upon his frown;
1480,MY DREAM.,"His punier brethren quaked before his tail,"
1481,MY DREAM.,"Broad as a rafter, potent as a flail."
1482,MY DREAM.,So he grew lord and master of his kin:
1483,MY DREAM.,But who shall tell the tale of all their woes?
1484,MY DREAM.,"An execrable appetite arose,"
1485,MY DREAM.,"He battened on them, crunched, and sucked them in."
1486,MY DREAM.,"He knew no law, he feared no binding law,"
1487,MY DREAM.,But ground them with inexorable jaw:
1488,MY DREAM.,"The luscious fat distilled upon his chin,"
1489,MY DREAM.,"Exuded from his nostrils and his eyes,"
1490,MY DREAM.,While still like hungry death he fed his maw;
1491,MY DREAM.,Till every minor crocodile being dead
1492,MY DREAM.,"And buried too, himself gorged to the full,"
1493,MY DREAM.,He slept with breath oppressed and unstrung claw.
1494,MY DREAM.,O marvel passing strange which next I saw:
1495,MY DREAM.,"In sleep he dwindled to the common size,"
1496,MY DREAM.,And all the empire faded from his coat.
1497,MY DREAM.,"Then from far off a wingèd vessel came,"
1498,MY DREAM.,"Swift as a swallow, subtle as a flame:"
1499,MY DREAM.,"I know not what it bore of freight or host,"
1500,MY DREAM.,But white it was as an avenging ghost.
1501,MY DREAM.,It levelled strong Euphrates in its course;
1502,MY DREAM.,Supreme yet weightless as an idle mote
1503,MY DREAM.,It seemed to tame the waters without force
1504,MY DREAM.,Till not a murmur swelled or billow beat:
1505,MY DREAM.,"Lo, as the purple shadow swept the sands,"
1506,MY DREAM.,The prudent crocodile rose on his feet
1507,MY DREAM.,And shed appropriate tears and wrung his hands.
1508,MY DREAM.,
1509,MY DREAM.,What can it mean? you ask. I answer not
1510,MY DREAM.,"For meaning, but myself must echo, What?"
1511,MY DREAM.,And tell it as I saw it on the spot.

2568,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD.,"I cannot write the words I said,"
2569,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD.,"My words were slow, my tears were few;"
2570,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD.,But through the dark my silence spoke
2571,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD.,"Like thunder. When this morning broke,"
2572,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD.,"My face was pinched, my hair was gray,"
2573,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD.,And frozen blood was on the sill

2576,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD.,If now you saw me you would say:

3862,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Was she a maid, or an evil dream?"
3863,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Her eyes began to glitter and gleam;
3864,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He would have gone, but he stayed instead;"
3865,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Green they gleamed as he looked in them:
3866,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Give me my fee,"" she said.--"
3867,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3868,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""I will give you a jewel of gold.""--"
3869,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Not so; gold is heavy and cold.""--"
3870,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""I will give you a velvet fold"
3871,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Of foreign work your beauty to deck.""--"
3872,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Better I like my kerchief rolled"
3873,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Light and white round my neck.""--"
3874,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3875,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Nay,"" cried he, ""but fix your own fee.""--"
3876,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"She laughed, ""You may give the full moon to me;"
3877,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Or else sit under this apple-tree
3878,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Here for one idle day by my side;
3879,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"After that I'll let you go free,"
3880,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And the world is wide."""
3881,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3882,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Loath to stay, but to leave her slack,"
3883,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He half turned away, then he quite turned back:"
3884,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,For courtesy's sake he could not lack
3885,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,To redeem his own royal pledge;
3886,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Ahead, too, the windy heaven lowered black"
3887,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,With a fire-cloven edge.
3888,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3889,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"So he stretched his length in the apple-tree shade,"
3890,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Lay and laughed and talked to the maid,"
3891,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Who twisted her hair in a cunning braid,"
3892,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And writhed it in shining serpent-coils,"
3893,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And held him a day and night fast laid
3894,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,In her subtle toils.
3895,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3896,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"At the death of night and the birth of day,"
3897,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"When the owl left off his sober play,"
3898,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And the bat hung himself out of the way,"
3899,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Woke the song of mavis and merle,"
3900,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And heaven put off its hodden gray
3901,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,For mother-o'-pearl.
3902,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3903,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Peeped up daisies here and there,"
3904,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Here, there, and everywhere;"
3905,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Rose a hopeful lark in the air,"
3906,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Spreading out towards the sun his breast;
3907,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,While the moon set solemn and fair
3908,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Away in the west.
3909,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3910,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Up, up, up,"" called the watchman lark,"
3911,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"In his clear réveillée: ""Hearken, O hark!"
3912,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Press to the high goal, fly to the mark."
3913,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Up, O sluggard, new morn is born;"
3914,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"If still asleep when the night falls dark,"
3915,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Thou must wait a second morn."""
3916,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3917,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Up, up, up,"" sad glad voices swelled:"
3918,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""So the tree falls and lies as it's felled."
3919,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Be thy bands loosed, O sleeper, long held"
3920,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,In sweet sleep whose end is not sweet.
3921,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Be the slackness girt and the softness quelled
3922,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And the slowness fleet."""
3923,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3924,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Off he set. The grass grew rare,"
3925,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"A blight lurked in the darkening air,"
3926,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The very moss grew hueless and spare,"
3927,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The last daisy stood all astunt;
3928,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Behind his back the soil lay bare,"
3929,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,But barer in front.
3930,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3931,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"A land of chasm and rent, a land"
3932,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Of rugged blackness on either hand:
3933,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"If water trickled, its track was tanned"
3934,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,With an edge of rust to the chink;
3935,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,If one stamped on stone or on sand
3936,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,It returned a clink.
3937,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3938,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"A lifeless land, a loveless land,"
3939,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Without lair or nest on either hand:
3940,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Only scorpions jerked in the sand,"
3941,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Black as black iron, or dusty pale;"
3942,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,From point to point sheer rock was manned
3943,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,By scorpions in mail.
3944,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3945,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"A land of neither life nor death,"
3946,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Where no man buildeth or fashioneth,"
3947,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Where none draws living or dying breath;
3948,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"No man cometh or goeth there,"
3949,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"No man doeth, seeketh, saith,"
3950,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,In the stagnant air.
3951,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3952,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Some old volcanic upset must
3953,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Have rent the crust and blackened the crust;
3954,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Wrenched and ribbed it beneath its dust
3955,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Above earth's molten centre at seethe,"
3956,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Heaved and heaped it by huge upthrust
3957,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Of fire beneath.
3958,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3959,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Untrodden before, untrodden since:"
3960,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Tedious land for a social Prince;
3961,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Halting, he scanned the outs and ins,"
3962,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Endless, labyrinthine, grim,"
3963,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Of the solitude that made him wince,"
3964,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Laying wait for him.
3965,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3966,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"By bulging rock and gaping cleft,"
3967,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Even of half mere daylight reft,"
3968,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Rueful he peered to right and left,"
3969,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Muttering in his altered mood:
3970,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""The fate is hard that weaves my weft,"
3971,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Though my lot be good."""
3972,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3973,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Dim the changes of day to night,"
3974,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Of night scarce dark to day not bright.
3975,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Still his road wound towards the right,"
3976,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Still he went, and still he went,"
3977,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Till one night he spied a light,"
3978,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,In his discontent.
3979,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3980,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Out it flashed from a yawn-mouthed cave,"
3981,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Like a red-hot eye from a grave.
3982,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,No man stood there of whom to crave
3983,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Rest for wayfarer plodding by:
3984,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Though the tenant were churl or knave
3985,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The Prince might try.
3986,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3987,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"In he passed and tarried not,"
3988,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Groping his way from spot to spot,"
3989,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Towards where the cavern flare glowed hot:--
3990,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"An old, old mortal, cramped and double,"
3991,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Was peering into a seething-pot,"
3992,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,In a world of trouble.
3993,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
3994,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The veriest atomy he looked,"
3995,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"With grimy fingers clutching and crooked,"
3996,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Tight skin, a nose all bony and hooked,"
3997,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And a shaking, sharp, suspicious way;"
3998,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Blinking, his eyes had scarcely brooked"
3999,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The light of day.
4000,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4001,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Stared the Prince, for the sight was new;"
4002,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Stared, but asked without more ado:"
4003,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""May a weary traveller lodge with you,"
4004,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Old father, here in your lair?"
4005,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"In your country the inns seem few,"
4006,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And scanty the fare."""
4007,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4008,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The head turned not to hear him speak;
4009,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The old voice whistled as through a leak
4010,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,(Out it came in a quavering squeak):
4011,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Work for wage is a bargain fit:"
4012,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,If there's aught of mine that you seek
4013,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,You must work for it.
4014,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4015,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Buried alive from light and air"
4016,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"This year is the hundredth year,"
4017,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"I feed my fire with a sleepless care,"
4018,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Watching my potion wane or wax:
4019,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Elixir of Life is simmering there,"
4020,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And but one thing lacks.
4021,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4022,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""If you're fain to lodge here with me,"
4023,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Take that pair of bellows you see,--"
4024,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Too heavy for my old hands they be,--"
4025,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Take the bellows and puff and puff:
4026,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,When the steam curls rosy and free
4027,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The broth's boiled enough.
4028,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4029,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Then take your choice of all I have;"
4030,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,I will give you life if you crave.
4031,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Already I'm mildewed for the grave,"
4032,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,So first myself I must drink my fill:
4033,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"But all the rest may be yours, to save"
4034,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Whomever you will."""
4035,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4036,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Done,"" quoth the Prince, and the bargain stood."
4037,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"First he piled on resinous wood,"
4038,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Next plied the bellows in hopeful mood;
4039,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Thinking, ""My love and I will live."
4040,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"If I tarry, why life is good,"
4041,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And she may forgive."""
4042,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4043,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The pot began to bubble and boil;
4044,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The old man cast in essence and oil,"
4045,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,He stirred all up with a triple coil
4046,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Of gold and silver and iron wire,"
4047,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Dredged in a pinch of virgin soil,"
4048,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And fed the fire.
4049,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4050,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,But still the steam curled watery white;
4051,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Night turned to day and day to night;
4052,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"One thing lacked, by his feeble sight"
4053,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Unseen, unguessed by his feeble mind:"
4054,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Life might miss him, but Death the blight"
4055,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Was sure to find.
4056,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4057,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,So when the hundredth year was full
4058,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The thread was cut and finished the school.
4059,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Death snapped the old worn-out tool,"
4060,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Snapped him short while he stood and stirred
4061,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,(Though stiff he stood as a stiff-necked mule)
4062,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,With never a word.
4063,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4064,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Thus at length the old crab was nipped.
4065,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The dead hand slipped, the dead finger dipped"
4066,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"In the broth as the dead man slipped,--"
4067,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"That same instant, a rosy red"
4068,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Flushed the steam, and quivered and clipped"
4069,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Round the dead old head.
4070,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4071,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The last ingredient was supplied
4072,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,(Unless the dead man mistook or lied).
4073,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Up started the Prince, he cast aside"
4074,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The bellows plied through the tedious trial,"
4075,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Made sure that his host had died,"
4076,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And filled a phial.
4077,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4078,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""One night's rest,"" thought the Prince. ""This done,"
4079,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Forth I speed with the rising sun:
4080,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"With the morrow I rise and run,"
4081,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Come what will of wind or of weather.
4082,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,This draught of Life when my Bride is won
4083,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"We'll drink together."""
4084,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4085,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Thus the dead man stayed in his grave,"
4086,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Self-chosen, the dead man in his cave;"
4087,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"There he stayed, were he fool or knave,"
4088,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Or honest seeker who had not found;
4089,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,While the Prince outside was prompt to crave
4090,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Sleep on the ground.
4091,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4092,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""If she watches, go bid her sleep;"
4093,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Bid her sleep, for the road is steep:"
4094,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He can sleep who holdeth her cheap,"
4095,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Sleep and wake and sleep again.
4096,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Let him sow, one day he shall reap,"
4097,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Let him sow the grain.
4098,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4099,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""When there blows a sweet garden rose,"
4100,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Let it bloom and wither if no man knows:
4101,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"But if one knows when the sweet thing blows,"
4102,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Knows, and lets it open and drop,"
4103,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,If but a nettle his garden grows
4104,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He hath earned the crop."""
4105,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4106,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Through his sleep the summons rang,"
4107,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Into his ears it sobbed and it sang.
4108,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Slow he woke with a drowsy pang,"
4109,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Shook himself without much debate,"
4110,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Turned where he saw green branches hang,"
4111,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Started though late.
4112,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4113,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"For the black land was travelled o'er,"
4114,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,He should see the grim land no more.
4115,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,A flowering country stretched before
4116,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,His face when the lovely day came back:
4117,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He hugged the phial of Life he bore,"
4118,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And resumed his track.
4119,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4120,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"By willow courses he took his path,"
4121,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Spied what a nest the kingfisher hath,"
4122,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Marked the fields green to aftermath,"
4123,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Marked where the red-brown field-mouse ran,"
4124,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Loitered awhile for a deep-stream bath,"
4125,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Yawned for a fellow-man.
4126,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4127,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Up on the hills not a soul in view,"
4128,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,In the vale not many nor few;
4129,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Leaves, still leaves, and nothing new."
4130,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"It's O for a second maiden, at least,"
4131,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"To bear the flagon, and taste it too,"
4132,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And flavor the feast.
4133,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4134,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Lagging he moved, and apt to swerve;"
4135,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Lazy of limb, but quick of nerve."
4136,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"At length the water-bed took a curve,"
4137,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The deep river swept its bank-side bare;
4138,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Waters streamed from the hill-reserve,--"
4139,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Waters here, waters there."
4140,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4141,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"High above, and deep below,"
4142,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Bursting, bubbling, swelling the flow,"
4143,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Like hill-torrents after the snow,--"
4144,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Bubbling, gurgling, in whirling strife,"
4145,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Swaying, sweeping, to and fro,--"
4146,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,He must swim for his life.
4147,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4148,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Which way?--which way?--his eyes grew dim
4149,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"With the dizzying whirl,--which way to swim?"
4150,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The thunderous downshoot deafened him;
4151,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Half he choked in the lashing spray:
4152,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Life is sweet, and the grave is grim,--"
4153,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Which way?--which way?
4154,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4155,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"A flash of light, a shout from the strand:"
4156,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""This way,--this way; here lies the land!"""
4157,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,His phial clutched in one drowning hand;
4158,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He catches,--misses,--catches a rope;"
4159,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,His feet slip on the slipping sand:
4160,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Is there life?--is there hope?
4161,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4162,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Just saved, without pulse or breath,--"
4163,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Scarcely saved from the gulp of death;
4164,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Laid where a willow shadoweth,--"
4165,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Laid where a swelling turf is smooth.
4166,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,(O Bride! but the Bridegroom lingereth
4167,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,For all thy sweet youth.)
4168,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4169,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Kind hands do and undo,"
4170,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Kind voices whisper and coo:
4171,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""I will chafe his hands,""--""and I,""--""and you"
4172,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Raise his head, put his hair aside."""
4173,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"(If many laugh, one well may rue:"
4174,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Sleep on, thou Bride.)"
4175,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4176,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,So the Prince was tended with care:
4177,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,One wrung foul ooze from his clustered hair;
4178,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Two chafed his hands, and did not spare;"
4179,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,But one propped his head that drooped awry
4180,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Till his eyes oped, and at unaware"
4181,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,They met eye to eye.
4182,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4183,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"O, a moon face in a shadowy place,"
4184,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And a light touch and a winsome grace,"
4185,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And a thrilling tender voice which says:
4186,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Safe from waters that seek the sea,--"
4187,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Cold waters by rugged ways,--"
4188,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Safe with me."""
4189,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4190,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"While overhead bird whistles to bird,"
4191,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And round about plays a gamesome herd:
4192,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Safe with us,""--some take up the word,--"
4193,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Safe with us, dear lord and friend:"
4194,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,All the sweeter if long deferred
4195,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Is rest in the end."""
4196,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4197,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Had he stayed to weigh and to scan,"
4198,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,He had been more or less than a man:
4199,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He did what a young man can,"
4200,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Spoke of toil and an arduous way,--"
4201,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Toil to-morrow, while golden ran"
4202,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The sands of to-day.
4203,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4204,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Slip past, slip fast,"
4205,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Uncounted hours from first to last,"
4206,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Many hours till the last is past,"
4207,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Many hours dwindling to one,--"
4208,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"One hour whose die is cast,"
4209,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,One last hour gone.
4210,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4211,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Come, gone,--gone forever,--"
4212,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Gone as an unreturning river,--"
4213,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Gone as to death the merriest liver,--"
4214,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Gone as the year at the dying fall,--"
4215,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"To-morrow, to-day, yesterday, never,--"
4216,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Gone once for all.
4217,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4218,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Came at length the starting-day,"
4219,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"With last words, and last, last words to say,"
4220,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"With bodiless cries from far away,--"
4221,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Chiding wailing voices that rang
4222,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Like a trumpet-call to the tug and fray;
4223,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And thus they sang:
4224,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4225,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Is there life?--the lamp burns low;"
4226,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Is there hope?--the coming is slow:
4227,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The promise promised so long ago,"

4229,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Does she live?--does she die?--she slumbers so
4230,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Who so oft has wept.
4231,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4232,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Does she live?--does she die?--she languisheth"
4233,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"As a lily drooping to death,"
4234,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"As a drought-worn bird with failing breath,"
4235,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"As a lovely vine without a stay,"
4236,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"As a tree whereof the owner saith,"
4237,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"'Hew it down to-day.'"""
4238,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4239,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Stung by that word the Prince was fain
4240,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,To start on his tedious road again.
4241,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He crossed the stream where a ford was plain,"
4242,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He clomb the opposite bank though steep,"
4243,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And swore to himself to strain and attain
4244,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Ere he tasted sleep.
4245,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4246,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Huge before him a mountain frowned
4247,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"With foot of rock on the valley ground,"
4248,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And head with snows incessant crowned,"
4249,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And a cloud mantle about its strength,"
4250,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And a path which the wild goat hath not found
4251,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,In its breadth and length.
4252,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4253,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,But he was strong to do and dare:
4254,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"If a host had withstood him there,"
4255,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,He had braved a host with little care
4256,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"In his lusty youth and his pride,"
4257,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Tough to grapple though weak to snare.
4258,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"He comes, O Bride."
4259,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4260,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Up he went where the goat scarce clings,"
4261,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Up where the eagle folds her wings,"
4262,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Past the green line of living things,"
4263,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Where the sun cannot warm the cold,--"
4264,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Up he went as a flame enrings
4265,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Where there seems no hold.
4266,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4267,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Up a fissure barren and black,"
4268,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Till the eagles tired upon his track,"
4269,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"And the clouds were left behind his back,--"
4270,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Up till the utmost peak was past.
4271,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Then he gasped for breath and his strength fell slack;
4272,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,He paused at last.
4273,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4274,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Before his face a valley spread
4275,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Where fatness laughed, wine, oil, and bread,"
4276,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Where all fruit-trees their sweetness shed,"
4277,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Where all birds made love to their kind,"
4278,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Where jewels twinkled, and gold lay red"
4279,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And not hard to find.
4280,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4281,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Midway down the mountain side
4282,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,(On its green slope the path was wide)
4283,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Stood a house for a royal bride,"
4284,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Built all of changing opal stone,"
4285,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The royal palace, till now descried"
4286,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,In his dreams alone.
4287,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4288,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Less bold than in days of yore,"
4289,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Doubting now though never before,"
4290,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Doubting he goes and lags the more:
4291,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Is the time late? does the day grow dim?
4292,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Rose, will she open the crimson core"
4293,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Of her heart to him?
4294,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4295,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Above his head a tangle glows
4296,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Of wine-red roses, blushes, snows,"
4297,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Closed buds and buds that unclose,"
4298,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Leaves, and moss, and prickles too;"
4299,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"His hand shook as he plucked a rose,"
4300,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And the rose dropped dew.
4301,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4302,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Take heart of grace! the portion of Life
4303,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,May go far to woo him a wife:
4304,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"If she frown, yet a lover's strife"
4305,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Lightly raised can be laid again:
4306,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,A hasty word is never the knife
4307,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,To cut love in twain.
4308,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4309,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Far away stretched the royal land,"
4310,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Fed by dew, by a spice-wind fanned:"
4311,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Light labor more, and his foot would stand"
4312,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"On the threshold, all labor done;"
4313,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Easy pleasure laid at his hand,"
4314,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And the dear Bride won.
4315,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4316,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"His slackening steps pause at the gate,--"
4317,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Does she wake or sleep?--the time is late,--"
4318,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Does she sleep now, or watch and wait?"
4319,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"She has watched, she has waited long,"
4320,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Watching athwart the golden grate
4321,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,With a patient song.
4322,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4323,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Fling the golden portals wide,"
4324,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The Bridegroom comes to his promised Bride;
4325,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Draw the gold-stiff curtains aside,"
4326,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Let them look on each other's face,"
4327,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"She in her meekness, he in his pride,--"
4328,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Day wears apace.
4329,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4330,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Day is over, the day that wore."
4331,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"What is this that comes through the door,"
4332,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The face covered, the feet before?"
4333,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,This that coming takes his breath;
4334,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"This Bride not seen, to be seen no more"
4335,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Save of Bridegroom Death?
4336,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4337,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Veiled figures carrying her
4338,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Sweep by yet make no stir;
4339,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"There is a smell of spice and myrrh,"
4340,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,A bride-chant burdened with one name;
4341,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The bride-song rises steadier
4342,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Than the torches' flame:
4343,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4344,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Too late for love, too late for joy,"
4345,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Too late, too late!"
4346,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"You loitered on the road too long,"
4347,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,You trifled at the gate:
4348,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The enchanted dove upon her branch
4349,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Died without a mate;
4350,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The enchanted princess in her tower
4351,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Slept, died, behind the grate;"
4352,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Her heart was starving all this while
4353,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,You made it wait.
4354,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4355,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Ten years ago, five years ago,"
4356,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"One year ago,"
4357,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Even then you had arrived in time,"
4358,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Though somewhat slow;
4359,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Then you had known her living face
4360,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Which now you cannot know:
4361,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The frozen fountain would have leaped,"
4362,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"The buds gone on to blow,"
4363,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,The warm south wind would have awaked
4364,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,To melt the snow.
4365,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4366,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""Is she fair now as she lies?"
4367,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Once she was fair;
4368,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Meet queen for any kingly king,"
4369,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,With gold-dust on her hair.
4370,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Now these are poppies in her locks,"
4371,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,White poppies she must wear;
4372,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Must wear a veil to shroud her face
4373,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And the want graven there:
4374,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Or is the hunger fed at length,"
4375,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Cast off the care?
4376,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4377,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""We never saw her with a smile"
4378,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Or with a frown;
4379,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Her bed seemed never soft to her,"
4380,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Though tossed of down;
4381,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"She little heeded what she wore,"
4382,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Kirtle, or wreath, or gown;"
4383,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,We think her white brows often ached
4384,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Beneath her crown,"
4385,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Till silvery hairs showed in her locks
4386,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,That used to be so brown.
4387,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4388,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""We never heard her speak in haste:"
4389,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Her tones were sweet,"
4390,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And modulated just so much
4391,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,As it was meet:
4392,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Her heart sat silent through the noise
4393,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,And concourse of the street.
4394,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"There was no hurry in her hands,"
4395,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,No hurry in her feet;
4396,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"There was no bliss drew nigh to her,"
4397,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,That she might run to greet.
4398,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,
4399,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"""You should have wept her yesterday,"
4400,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Wasting upon her bed:
4401,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,But wherefore should you weep to-day
4402,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,That she is dead?
4403,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Lo, we who love weep not to-day,"
4404,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,But crown her royal head.
4405,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Let be these poppies that we strew,"
4406,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,Your roses are too red:
4407,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Let be these poppies, not for you"
4408,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS.,"Cut down and spread."""

4418,MAIDEN-SONG.,MAIDEN-SONG.
4419,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4420,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4421,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Long ago and long ago,"
4422,MAIDEN-SONG.,"And long ago still,"
4423,MAIDEN-SONG.,There dwelt three merry maidens
4424,MAIDEN-SONG.,Upon a distant hill.
4425,MAIDEN-SONG.,"One was tall Meggan,"
4426,MAIDEN-SONG.,"And one was dainty May,"
4427,MAIDEN-SONG.,"But one was fair Margaret,"
4428,MAIDEN-SONG.,"More fair than I can say,"
4429,MAIDEN-SONG.,Long ago and long ago.
4430,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4431,MAIDEN-SONG.,"When Meggan plucked the thorny rose,"
4432,MAIDEN-SONG.,"And when May pulled the brier,"
4433,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Half the birds would swoop to see,"
4434,MAIDEN-SONG.,Half the beasts draw nigher;
4435,MAIDEN-SONG.,Half the fishes of the streams
4436,MAIDEN-SONG.,Would dart up to admire:
4437,MAIDEN-SONG.,"But when Margaret plucked a flag-flower,"
4438,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Or poppy hot aflame,"
4439,MAIDEN-SONG.,All the beasts and all the birds
4440,MAIDEN-SONG.,And all the fishes came
4441,MAIDEN-SONG.,To her hand more soft than snow.
4442,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4443,MAIDEN-SONG.,Strawberry leaves and May-dew
4444,MAIDEN-SONG.,"In brisk morning air,"
4445,MAIDEN-SONG.,Strawberry leaves and May-dew
4446,MAIDEN-SONG.,Make maidens fair.
4447,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""I go for strawberry-leaves,"""
4448,MAIDEN-SONG.,Meggan said one day:
4449,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""Fair Margaret can bide at home,"
4450,MAIDEN-SONG.,"But you come with me, May;"
4451,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Up the hill and down the hill,"
4452,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Along the winding way,"
4453,MAIDEN-SONG.,"You and I are used to go."""
4454,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4455,MAIDEN-SONG.,So these two fair sisters
4456,MAIDEN-SONG.,Went with innocent will
4457,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Up the hill and down again,"
4458,MAIDEN-SONG.,And round the homestead hill:
4459,MAIDEN-SONG.,"While the fairest sat at home,"
4460,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Margaret like a queen,"
4461,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Like a blush-rose, like the moon"
4462,MAIDEN-SONG.,"In her heavenly sheen,"
4463,MAIDEN-SONG.,Fragrant-breathed as milky cow
4464,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Or field of blossoming bean,"
4465,MAIDEN-SONG.,Graceful as an ivy bough
4466,MAIDEN-SONG.,Born to cling and lean;
4467,MAIDEN-SONG.,Thus she sat to sing and sew.
4468,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4469,MAIDEN-SONG.,When she raised her lustrous eyes
4470,MAIDEN-SONG.,A beast peeped at the door;
4471,MAIDEN-SONG.,When she downward cast her eyes
4472,MAIDEN-SONG.,A fish gasped on the floor;
4473,MAIDEN-SONG.,When she turned away her eyes
4474,MAIDEN-SONG.,"A bird perched on the sill,"
4475,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Warbling out its heart of love,"
4476,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Warbling, warbling still,"
4477,MAIDEN-SONG.,With pathetic pleadings low.
4478,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4479,MAIDEN-SONG.,Light-foot May with Meggan
4480,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Sought the choicest spot,"
4481,MAIDEN-SONG.,Clothed with thyme-alternate grass:
4482,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Then, while day waxed hot,"
4483,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Sat at ease to play and rest,"
4484,MAIDEN-SONG.,A gracious rest and play;
4485,MAIDEN-SONG.,"The loveliest maidens near or far,"
4486,MAIDEN-SONG.,"When Margaret was away,"
4487,MAIDEN-SONG.,Who sat at home to sing and sew.
4488,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4489,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Sun-glow flushed their comely cheeks,"
4490,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Wind-play tossed their hair,"
4491,MAIDEN-SONG.,Creeping things among the grass
4492,MAIDEN-SONG.,Stroked them here and there;
4493,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Meggan piped a merry note,"
4494,MAIDEN-SONG.,"A fitful, wayward lay,"
4495,MAIDEN-SONG.,While shrill as bird on topmost twig
4496,MAIDEN-SONG.,Piped merry May;
4497,MAIDEN-SONG.,Honey-smooth the double flow.
4498,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4499,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Sped a herdsman from the vale,"
4500,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Mounting like a flame,"
4501,MAIDEN-SONG.,All on fire to hear and see
4502,MAIDEN-SONG.,With floating locks he came.
4503,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Looked neither north nor south,"
4504,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Neither east nor west,"
4505,MAIDEN-SONG.,But sat him down at Meggan's feet
4506,MAIDEN-SONG.,"As love-bird on his nest,"
4507,MAIDEN-SONG.,"And wooed her with a silent awe,"
4508,MAIDEN-SONG.,With trouble not expressed;
4509,MAIDEN-SONG.,"She sang the tears into his eyes,"
4510,MAIDEN-SONG.,The heart out of his breast:
4511,MAIDEN-SONG.,"So he loved her, listening so."
4512,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4513,MAIDEN-SONG.,"She sang the heart out of his breast,"
4514,MAIDEN-SONG.,The words out of his tongue;
4515,MAIDEN-SONG.,Hand and foot and pulse he paused
4516,MAIDEN-SONG.,Till her song was sung.
4517,MAIDEN-SONG.,Then he spoke up from his place
4518,MAIDEN-SONG.,Simple words and true:
4519,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""Scanty goods have I to give,"
4520,MAIDEN-SONG.,Scanty skill to woo;
4521,MAIDEN-SONG.,"But I have a will to work,"
4522,MAIDEN-SONG.,And a heart for you:
4523,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Bid me stay or bid me go."""
4524,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4525,MAIDEN-SONG.,Then Meggan mused within herself:
4526,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""Better be first with him,"
4527,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Than dwell where fairer Margaret sits,"
4528,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Who shines my brightness dim,"
4529,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Forever second where she sits,"
4530,MAIDEN-SONG.,However fair I be:
4531,MAIDEN-SONG.,"I will be lady of his love,"
4532,MAIDEN-SONG.,And he shall worship me;
4533,MAIDEN-SONG.,I will be lady of his herds
4534,MAIDEN-SONG.,"And stoop to his degree,"
4535,MAIDEN-SONG.,"At home where kids and fatlings grow."""
4536,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4537,MAIDEN-SONG.,Sped a shepherd from the height
4538,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Headlong down to look,"
4539,MAIDEN-SONG.,"(White lambs followed, lured by love"
4540,MAIDEN-SONG.,Of their shepherd's crook):
4541,MAIDEN-SONG.,"He turned neither east nor west,"
4542,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Neither north nor south,"
4543,MAIDEN-SONG.,"But knelt right down to May, for love"
4544,MAIDEN-SONG.,Of her sweet-singing mouth;
4545,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Forgot his flocks, his panting flocks"
4546,MAIDEN-SONG.,In parching hillside drouth;
4547,MAIDEN-SONG.,Forgot himself for weal or woe.
4548,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4549,MAIDEN-SONG.,Trilled her song and swelled her song
4550,MAIDEN-SONG.,With maiden coy caprice
4551,MAIDEN-SONG.,"In a labyrinth of throbs,"
4552,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Pauses, cadences;"
4553,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Clear-noted as a dropping brook,"
4554,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Soft-noted like the bees,"
4555,MAIDEN-SONG.,Wild-noted as the shivering wind
4556,MAIDEN-SONG.,Forlorn through forest trees:
4557,MAIDEN-SONG.,Love-noted like the wood-pigeon
4558,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Who hides herself for love,"
4559,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Yet cannot keep her secret safe,"
4560,MAIDEN-SONG.,But cooes and cooes thereof:
4561,MAIDEN-SONG.,Thus the notes rang loud or low.
4562,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4563,MAIDEN-SONG.,He hung breathless on her breath;
4564,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Speechless, who listened well;"
4565,MAIDEN-SONG.,Could not speak or think or wish
4566,MAIDEN-SONG.,Till silence broke the spell.
4567,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Then he spoke, and spread his hands"
4568,MAIDEN-SONG.,Pointing here and there:
4569,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""See my sheep and see the lambs,"
4570,MAIDEN-SONG.,Twin lambs which they bare.
4571,MAIDEN-SONG.,"All myself I offer you,"
4572,MAIDEN-SONG.,"All my flocks and care,"
4573,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Your sweet song hath moved me so."""
4574,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4575,MAIDEN-SONG.,In her fluttered heart young May
4576,MAIDEN-SONG.,Mused a dubious while:
4577,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""If he loves me as he says""--"
4578,MAIDEN-SONG.,Her lips curved with a smile:
4579,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""Where Margaret shines like the sun,"
4580,MAIDEN-SONG.,I shine but like a moon;
4581,MAIDEN-SONG.,If sister Meggan makes her choice
4582,MAIDEN-SONG.,I can make mine as soon;
4583,MAIDEN-SONG.,"At cockcrow we were sister-maids,"
4584,MAIDEN-SONG.,"We may be brides at noon."""
4585,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Said Meggan, ""Yes""; May said not ""No."""
4586,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4587,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Fair Margaret stayed alone at home,"
4588,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Awhile she sang her song,"
4589,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Awhile sat silent, then she thought:"
4590,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""My sisters loiter long."""
4591,MAIDEN-SONG.,"That sultry noon had waned away,"
4592,MAIDEN-SONG.,Shadows had waxen great:
4593,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""Surely,"" she thought within herself,"
4594,MAIDEN-SONG.,"""My sisters loiter late."""
4595,MAIDEN-SONG.,"She rose, and peered out at the door,"
4596,MAIDEN-SONG.,"With patient heart to wait,"
4597,MAIDEN-SONG.,And heard a distant nightingale
4598,MAIDEN-SONG.,Complaining of its mate;
4599,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Then down the garden slope she walked,"
4600,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Down to the garden gate,"
4601,MAIDEN-SONG.,Leaned on the rail and waited so.
4602,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4603,MAIDEN-SONG.,The slope was lightened by her eyes
4604,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Like summer lightning fair,"
4605,MAIDEN-SONG.,Like rising of the haloed moon
4606,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Lightened her glimmering hair,"
4607,MAIDEN-SONG.,While her face lightened like the sun
4608,MAIDEN-SONG.,Whose dawn is rosy white.
4609,MAIDEN-SONG.,Thus crowned with maiden majesty
4610,MAIDEN-SONG.,"She peered into the night,"
4611,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Looked up the hill and down the hill,"
4612,MAIDEN-SONG.,"To left hand and to right,"
4613,MAIDEN-SONG.,Flashing like fire-flies to and fro.
4614,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4615,MAIDEN-SONG.,Waiting thus in weariness
4616,MAIDEN-SONG.,She marked the nightingale
4617,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Telling, if any one would heed,"
4618,MAIDEN-SONG.,Its old complaining tale.
4619,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Then lifted she her voice and sang,"
4620,MAIDEN-SONG.,Answering the bird:
4621,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Then lifted she her voice and sang,"
4622,MAIDEN-SONG.,Such notes were never heard
4623,MAIDEN-SONG.,From any bird when Spring's in blow.
4624,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4625,MAIDEN-SONG.,The king of all that country
4626,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Coursing far, coursing near,"
4627,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Curbed his amber-bitted steed,"
4628,MAIDEN-SONG.,Coursed amain to hear;
4629,MAIDEN-SONG.,"All his princes in his train,"
4630,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Squire, and knight, and peer,"
4631,MAIDEN-SONG.,"With his crown upon his head,"
4632,MAIDEN-SONG.,"His sceptre in his hand,"
4633,MAIDEN-SONG.,Down he fell at Margaret's knees
4634,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Lord king of all that land,"
4635,MAIDEN-SONG.,To her highness bending low.
4636,MAIDEN-SONG.,
4637,MAIDEN-SONG.,Every beast and bird and fish
4638,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Came mustering to the sound,"
4639,MAIDEN-SONG.,Every man and every maid
4640,MAIDEN-SONG.,From miles of country round:
4641,MAIDEN-SONG.,"Meggan on her herdsman's arm,"
4642,MAIDEN-SONG.,"With her shepherd, May,"
4643,MAIDEN-SONG.,Flocks and herds trooped at their heels
4644,MAIDEN-SONG.,Along the hillside way;
4645,MAIDEN-SONG.,"No foot too feeble for the ascent,"
4646,MAIDEN-SONG.,Not any head too gray;
4647,MAIDEN-SONG.,Some were swift and none were slow.

6721,UNDER THE ROSE.,Our neighboring gentry reared
6722,UNDER THE ROSE.,"The good old-fashioned crops,"
6723,UNDER THE ROSE.,And made old-fashioned boasts
6724,UNDER THE ROSE.,Of what John Bull would do
6725,UNDER THE ROSE.,"If Frenchman Frog appeared,"
6726,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And drank old-fashioned toasts,"
6727,UNDER THE ROSE.,And made old-fashioned bows
6728,UNDER THE ROSE.,To my Lady at the Hall.
6729,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6730,UNDER THE ROSE.,My Lady at the Hall
6731,UNDER THE ROSE.,Is grander than they all:
6732,UNDER THE ROSE.,Hers is the oldest name
6733,UNDER THE ROSE.,In all the neighborhood;
6734,UNDER THE ROSE.,But the race must die with her
6735,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Though she's a lofty dame,"
6736,UNDER THE ROSE.,For she's unmarried still.
6737,UNDER THE ROSE.,Poor people say she's good
6738,UNDER THE ROSE.,And has an open hand
6739,UNDER THE ROSE.,"As any in the land,"
6740,UNDER THE ROSE.,And she's the comforter
6741,UNDER THE ROSE.,Of many sick and sad;
6742,UNDER THE ROSE.,My nurse once said to me
6743,UNDER THE ROSE.,That everything she had
6744,UNDER THE ROSE.,Came of my Lady's bounty:
6745,UNDER THE ROSE.,"""Though she's greatest in the county"
6746,UNDER THE ROSE.,"She's humble to the poor,"
6747,UNDER THE ROSE.,No beggar seeks her door
6748,UNDER THE ROSE.,But finds help presently.
6749,UNDER THE ROSE.,I pray both night and day
6750,UNDER THE ROSE.,"For her, and you must pray:"
6751,UNDER THE ROSE.,But she'll never feel distress
6752,UNDER THE ROSE.,"If needy folk can bless."""
6753,UNDER THE ROSE.,I was a little maid
6754,UNDER THE ROSE.,When here we came to live
6755,UNDER THE ROSE.,From somewhere by the sea.
6756,UNDER THE ROSE.,Men spoke a foreign tongue
6757,UNDER THE ROSE.,There where we used to be
6758,UNDER THE ROSE.,"When I was merry and young,"
6759,UNDER THE ROSE.,Too young to feel afraid;
6760,UNDER THE ROSE.,The fisher-folk would give
6761,UNDER THE ROSE.,"A kind strange word to me,"
6762,UNDER THE ROSE.,There by the foreign sea:
6763,UNDER THE ROSE.,"I don't know where it was,"
6764,UNDER THE ROSE.,But I remember still
6765,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Our cottage on a hill,"
6766,UNDER THE ROSE.,And fields of flowering grass
6767,UNDER THE ROSE.,On that fair foreign shore.
6768,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6769,UNDER THE ROSE.,"I liked my old home best,"
6770,UNDER THE ROSE.,But this was pleasant too:
6771,UNDER THE ROSE.,So here we made our nest
6772,UNDER THE ROSE.,And here I grew.
6773,UNDER THE ROSE.,And now and then my Lady
6774,UNDER THE ROSE.,In riding past our door
6775,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Would nod to nurse and speak,"
6776,UNDER THE ROSE.,Or stoop and pat my cheek;
6777,UNDER THE ROSE.,And I was always ready
6778,UNDER THE ROSE.,To hold the field-gate wide
6779,UNDER THE ROSE.,For my Lady to go through;
6780,UNDER THE ROSE.,My Lady in her veil
6781,UNDER THE ROSE.,"So seldom put aside,"
6782,UNDER THE ROSE.,My Lady grave and pale.
6783,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6784,UNDER THE ROSE.,I often sat to wonder
6785,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Who might my parents be,"
6786,UNDER THE ROSE.,For I knew of something under
6787,UNDER THE ROSE.,My simple-seeming state.
6788,UNDER THE ROSE.,Nurse never talked to me
6789,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Of mother or of father,"
6790,UNDER THE ROSE.,But watched me early and late
6791,UNDER THE ROSE.,With kind suspicious cares:
6792,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Or not suspicious, rather"
6793,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Anxious, as if she knew"
6794,UNDER THE ROSE.,Some secret I might gather
6795,UNDER THE ROSE.,And smart for unawares.
6796,UNDER THE ROSE.,Thus I grew.
6797,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6798,UNDER THE ROSE.,"But Nurse waxed old and gray,"
6799,UNDER THE ROSE.,Bent and weak with years.
6800,UNDER THE ROSE.,There came a certain day
6801,UNDER THE ROSE.,That she lay upon her bed
6802,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Shaking her palsied head,"
6803,UNDER THE ROSE.,With words she gasped to say
6804,UNDER THE ROSE.,Which had to stay unsaid.
6805,UNDER THE ROSE.,Then with a jerking hand
6806,UNDER THE ROSE.,Held out so piteously
6807,UNDER THE ROSE.,She gave a ring to me
6808,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Of gold wrought curiously,"
6809,UNDER THE ROSE.,A ring which she had worn
6810,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Since the day that I was born,"
6811,UNDER THE ROSE.,She once had said to me:
6812,UNDER THE ROSE.,I slipped it on my finger;
6813,UNDER THE ROSE.,Her eyes were keen to linger
6814,UNDER THE ROSE.,On my hand that slipped it on;
6815,UNDER THE ROSE.,Then she sighed one rattling sigh
6816,UNDER THE ROSE.,And stared on with sightless eye:--
6817,UNDER THE ROSE.,The one who loved me was gone.
6818,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6819,UNDER THE ROSE.,How long I stayed alone
6820,UNDER THE ROSE.,"With the corpse I never knew,"
6821,UNDER THE ROSE.,For I fainted dead as stone:
6822,UNDER THE ROSE.,When I came to life once more
6823,UNDER THE ROSE.,"I was down upon the floor,"
6824,UNDER THE ROSE.,With neighbors making ado
6825,UNDER THE ROSE.,To bring me back to life.
6826,UNDER THE ROSE.,I heard the sexton's wife
6827,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Say: ""Up, my lad, and run"
6828,UNDER THE ROSE.,To tell it at the Hall;
6829,UNDER THE ROSE.,"She was my Lady's nurse,"
6830,UNDER THE ROSE.,And done can't be undone.
6831,UNDER THE ROSE.,I'll watch by this poor lamb.
6832,UNDER THE ROSE.,I guess my Lady's purse
6833,UNDER THE ROSE.,Is always open to such:
6834,UNDER THE ROSE.,I'd run up on my crutch
6835,UNDER THE ROSE.,"A cripple as I am,"""
6836,UNDER THE ROSE.,"(For cramps had vexed her much,)"
6837,UNDER THE ROSE.,"""Rather than this dear heart"
6838,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Lack one to take her part."""
6839,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6840,UNDER THE ROSE.,"For days, day after day,"
6841,UNDER THE ROSE.,"On my weary bed I lay,"
6842,UNDER THE ROSE.,Wishing the time would pass;
6843,UNDER THE ROSE.,"O, so wishing that I was"
6844,UNDER THE ROSE.,Likely to pass away:
6845,UNDER THE ROSE.,For the one friend whom I knew
6846,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Was dead, I knew no other,"
6847,UNDER THE ROSE.,Neither father nor mother;
6848,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And I, what should I do?"
6849,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6850,UNDER THE ROSE.,One day the sexton's wife
6851,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Said: ""Rouse yourself, my dear:"
6852,UNDER THE ROSE.,My Lady has driven down
6853,UNDER THE ROSE.,"From the Hall into the town,"
6854,UNDER THE ROSE.,And we think she's coming here.
6855,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Cheer up, for life is life."""
6856,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6857,UNDER THE ROSE.,"But I would not look or speak,"
6858,UNDER THE ROSE.,Would not cheer up at all.
6859,UNDER THE ROSE.,"My tears were like to fall,"
6860,UNDER THE ROSE.,So I turned round to the wall
6861,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And hid my hollow cheek,"
6862,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Making as if I slept,"
6863,UNDER THE ROSE.,"As silent as a stone,"
6864,UNDER THE ROSE.,And no one knew I wept.
6865,UNDER THE ROSE.,"What was my Lady to me,"
6866,UNDER THE ROSE.,The grand lady from the Hall?
6867,UNDER THE ROSE.,"She might come, or stay away,"
6868,UNDER THE ROSE.,I was sick at heart that day:
6869,UNDER THE ROSE.,The whole world seemed to be
6870,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Nothing, just nothing to me,"
6871,UNDER THE ROSE.,For aught that I could see.
6872,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6873,UNDER THE ROSE.,Yet I listened where I lay:
6874,UNDER THE ROSE.,"A bustle came below,"
6875,UNDER THE ROSE.,"A clear voice said: ""I know;"
6876,UNDER THE ROSE.,"I will see her first alone,"
6877,UNDER THE ROSE.,It may be less of a shock
6878,UNDER THE ROSE.,"If she's so weak to-day"":--"
6879,UNDER THE ROSE.,"A light hand turned the lock,"
6880,UNDER THE ROSE.,"A light step crossed the floor,"
6881,UNDER THE ROSE.,One sat beside my bed:
6882,UNDER THE ROSE.,But never a word she said.
6883,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6884,UNDER THE ROSE.,"For me, my shyness grew"
6885,UNDER THE ROSE.,Each moment more and more:
6886,UNDER THE ROSE.,So I said never a word
6887,UNDER THE ROSE.,And neither looked nor stirred;
6888,UNDER THE ROSE.,I think she must have heard
6889,UNDER THE ROSE.,My heart go pit-a-pat:
6890,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Thus I lay, my Lady sat,"
6891,UNDER THE ROSE.,More than a mortal hour
6892,UNDER THE ROSE.,(I counted one and two
6893,UNDER THE ROSE.,By the house-clock while I lay):
6894,UNDER THE ROSE.,I seemed to have no power
6895,UNDER THE ROSE.,"To think of a thing to say,"
6896,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Or do what I ought to do,"
6897,UNDER THE ROSE.,Or rouse myself to a choice.
6898,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6899,UNDER THE ROSE.,"At last she said: ""Margaret,"
6900,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Won't you even look at me?"""
6901,UNDER THE ROSE.,A something in her voice
6902,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Forced my tears to fall at last,"
6903,UNDER THE ROSE.,Forced sobs from me thick and fast;
6904,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Something not of the past,"
6905,UNDER THE ROSE.,Yet stirring memory;
6906,UNDER THE ROSE.,"A something new, and yet"
6907,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Not new, too sweet to last,"
6908,UNDER THE ROSE.,Which I never can forget.
6909,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6910,UNDER THE ROSE.,I turned and stared at her:
6911,UNDER THE ROSE.,Her cheek showed hollow-pale;
6912,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Her hair like mine was fair,"
6913,UNDER THE ROSE.,A wonderful fall of hair
6914,UNDER THE ROSE.,That screened her like a veil;
6915,UNDER THE ROSE.,"But her height was statelier,"
6916,UNDER THE ROSE.,Her eyes had depth more deep:
6917,UNDER THE ROSE.,I think they must have had
6918,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Always a something sad,"
6919,UNDER THE ROSE.,Unless they were asleep.
6920,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6921,UNDER THE ROSE.,"While I stared, my Lady took"
6922,UNDER THE ROSE.,"My hand in her spare hand,"
6923,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Jewelled and soft and grand,"
6924,UNDER THE ROSE.,And looked with a long long look
6925,UNDER THE ROSE.,Of hunger in my face;
6926,UNDER THE ROSE.,As if she tried to trace
6927,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Features she ought to know,"
6928,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And half hoped, half feared, to find."
6929,UNDER THE ROSE.,Whatever was in her mind
6930,UNDER THE ROSE.,"She heaved a sigh at last,"
6931,UNDER THE ROSE.,And began to talk to me.
6932,UNDER THE ROSE.,"""Your nurse was my dear nurse,"
6933,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And her nursling's dear,"" said she:"
6934,UNDER THE ROSE.,"""No one told me a word"
6935,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Of her getting worse and worse,"
6936,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Till her poor life was past"""
6937,UNDER THE ROSE.,(Here my Lady's tears dropped fast):
6938,UNDER THE ROSE.,"""I might have been with her,"
6939,UNDER THE ROSE.,"I might have promised and heard,"
6940,UNDER THE ROSE.,But she had no comforter.
6941,UNDER THE ROSE.,She might have told me much
6942,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Which now I shall never know,"
6943,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Never, never shall know."""
6944,UNDER THE ROSE.,"She sat by me sobbing so,"
6945,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And seemed so woe-begone,"
6946,UNDER THE ROSE.,That I laid one hand upon
6947,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Hers with a timid touch,"
6948,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Scarce thinking what I did,"
6949,UNDER THE ROSE.,Not knowing what to say:
6950,UNDER THE ROSE.,That moment her face was hid
6951,UNDER THE ROSE.,"In the pillow close by mine,"
6952,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Her arm was flung over me,"
6953,UNDER THE ROSE.,"She hugged me, sobbing so"
6954,UNDER THE ROSE.,"As if her heart would break,"
6955,UNDER THE ROSE.,And kissed me where I lay.
6956,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6957,UNDER THE ROSE.,After this she often came
6958,UNDER THE ROSE.,"To bring me fruit or wine,"
6959,UNDER THE ROSE.,Or sometimes hothouse flowers.
6960,UNDER THE ROSE.,And at nights I lay awake
6961,UNDER THE ROSE.,Often and often thinking
6962,UNDER THE ROSE.,What to do for her sake.
6963,UNDER THE ROSE.,Wet or dry it was the same:
6964,UNDER THE ROSE.,"She would come in at all hours,"
6965,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Set me eating and drinking,"
6966,UNDER THE ROSE.,And say I must grow strong;
6967,UNDER THE ROSE.,At last the day seemed long
6968,UNDER THE ROSE.,And home seemed scarcely home
6969,UNDER THE ROSE.,If she did not come.
6970,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6971,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Well, I grew strong again:"
6972,UNDER THE ROSE.,In time of primroses
6973,UNDER THE ROSE.,I went to pluck them in the lane;
6974,UNDER THE ROSE.,In time of nestling birds
6975,UNDER THE ROSE.,I heard them chirping round the house;
6976,UNDER THE ROSE.,And all the herds
6977,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Were out at grass when I grew strong,"
6978,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And days were waxen long,"
6979,UNDER THE ROSE.,And there was work for bees
6980,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Among the May-bush boughs,"
6981,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And I had shot up tall,"
6982,UNDER THE ROSE.,And life felt after all
6983,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Pleasant, and not so long"
6984,UNDER THE ROSE.,When I grew strong.
6985,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6986,UNDER THE ROSE.,I was going to the Hall
6987,UNDER THE ROSE.,To be my Lady's maid:
6988,UNDER THE ROSE.,"""Her little friend,"" she said to me,"
6989,UNDER THE ROSE.,"""Almost her child,"""
6990,UNDER THE ROSE.,"She said and smiled,"
6991,UNDER THE ROSE.,Sighing painfully;
6992,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Blushing, with a second flush,"
6993,UNDER THE ROSE.,As if she blushed to blush.
6994,UNDER THE ROSE.,
6995,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Friend, servant, child: just this"
6996,UNDER THE ROSE.,My standing at the Hall;
6997,UNDER THE ROSE.,"The other servants call me ""Miss,"""
6998,UNDER THE ROSE.,"My Lady calls me ""Margaret,"""
6999,UNDER THE ROSE.,With her clear voice musical.
7000,UNDER THE ROSE.,She never chides when I forget
7001,UNDER THE ROSE.,This or that; she never chides.
7002,UNDER THE ROSE.,Except when people come to stay
7003,UNDER THE ROSE.,"(And that's not often) at the Hall,"
7004,UNDER THE ROSE.,I sit with her all day
7005,UNDER THE ROSE.,And ride out when she rides.
7006,UNDER THE ROSE.,She sings to me and makes me sing;
7007,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Sometimes I read to her,"
7008,UNDER THE ROSE.,Sometimes we merely sit and talk.
7009,UNDER THE ROSE.,She noticed once my ring
7010,UNDER THE ROSE.,And made me tell its history:
7011,UNDER THE ROSE.,That evening in our garden walk
7012,UNDER THE ROSE.,She said she should infer
7013,UNDER THE ROSE.,"The ring had been my father's first,"
7014,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Then my mother's, given for me"
7015,UNDER THE ROSE.,To the nurse who nursed
7016,UNDER THE ROSE.,"My mother in her misery,"
7017,UNDER THE ROSE.,That so quite certainly
7018,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Some one might know me, who--"
7019,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Then she was silent, and I too."
7020,UNDER THE ROSE.,
7021,UNDER THE ROSE.,I hate when people come:
7022,UNDER THE ROSE.,The women speak and stare
7023,UNDER THE ROSE.,And mean to be so civil.
7024,UNDER THE ROSE.,"This one will stroke my hair,"
7025,UNDER THE ROSE.,That one will pat my cheek
7026,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And praise my Lady's kindness,"
7027,UNDER THE ROSE.,Expecting me to speak;
7028,UNDER THE ROSE.,I like the proud ones best
7029,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Who sit as struck with blindness,"
7030,UNDER THE ROSE.,As if I wasn't there.
7031,UNDER THE ROSE.,But if any gentleman
7032,UNDER THE ROSE.,Is staying at the Hall
7033,UNDER THE ROSE.,"(Though few come prying here),"
7034,UNDER THE ROSE.,My Lady seems to fear
7035,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Some downright dreadful evil,"
7036,UNDER THE ROSE.,And makes me keep my room
7037,UNDER THE ROSE.,As closely as she can:
7038,UNDER THE ROSE.,"So I hate when people come,"
7039,UNDER THE ROSE.,It is so troublesome.
7040,UNDER THE ROSE.,"In spite of all her care,"
7041,UNDER THE ROSE.,Sometimes to keep alive
7042,UNDER THE ROSE.,I sometimes do contrive
7043,UNDER THE ROSE.,To get out in the grounds
7044,UNDER THE ROSE.,"For a whiff of wholesome air,"
7045,UNDER THE ROSE.,Under the rose you know:
7046,UNDER THE ROSE.,"It's charming to break bounds,"
7047,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Stolen waters are sweet,"
7048,UNDER THE ROSE.,And what's the good of feet
7049,UNDER THE ROSE.,If for days they mustn't go?
7050,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Give me a longer tether,"
7051,UNDER THE ROSE.,Or I may break from it.
7052,UNDER THE ROSE.,
7053,UNDER THE ROSE.,Now I have eyes and ears
7054,UNDER THE ROSE.,And just some little wit:
7055,UNDER THE ROSE.,"""Almost my lady's child"";"
7056,UNDER THE ROSE.,"I recollect she smiled,"
7057,UNDER THE ROSE.,Sighed and blushed together;
7058,UNDER THE ROSE.,Then her story of the ring
7059,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Sounds not improbable,"
7060,UNDER THE ROSE.,She told it me so well
7061,UNDER THE ROSE.,It seemed the actual thing:--
7062,UNDER THE ROSE.,"O keep your counsel close,"
7063,UNDER THE ROSE.,"But I guess under the rose,"
7064,UNDER THE ROSE.,In long past summer weather
7065,UNDER THE ROSE.,"When the world was blossoming,"
7066,UNDER THE ROSE.,And the rose upon its thorn:
7067,UNDER THE ROSE.,I guess not who he was
7068,UNDER THE ROSE.,Flawed honor like a glass
7069,UNDER THE ROSE.,And made my life forlorn;
7070,UNDER THE ROSE.,"But my Mother, Mother, Mother,"
7071,UNDER THE ROSE.,"O, I know her from all other."
7072,UNDER THE ROSE.,
7073,UNDER THE ROSE.,"My Lady, you might trust"
7074,UNDER THE ROSE.,Your daughter with your fame.
7075,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Trust me, I would not shame"
7076,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Our honorable name,"
7077,UNDER THE ROSE.,For I have noble blood
7078,UNDER THE ROSE.,Though I was bred in dust
7079,UNDER THE ROSE.,And brought up in the mud.
7080,UNDER THE ROSE.,"I will not press my claim,"
7081,UNDER THE ROSE.,Just leave me where you will:
7082,UNDER THE ROSE.,"But you might trust your daughter,"
7083,UNDER THE ROSE.,For blood is thicker than water
7084,UNDER THE ROSE.,And you're my mother still.
7085,UNDER THE ROSE.,
7086,UNDER THE ROSE.,So my Lady holds her own
7087,UNDER THE ROSE.,"With condescending grace,"
7088,UNDER THE ROSE.,And fills her lofty place
7089,UNDER THE ROSE.,With an untroubled face
7090,UNDER THE ROSE.,As a queen may fill a throne.
7091,UNDER THE ROSE.,While I could hint a tale
7092,UNDER THE ROSE.,(But then I am her child)
7093,UNDER THE ROSE.,Would make her quail;
7094,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Would set her in the dust,"
7095,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Lorn with no comforter,"
7096,UNDER THE ROSE.,Her glorious hair defiled
7097,UNDER THE ROSE.,And ashes on her cheek:
7098,UNDER THE ROSE.,The decent world would thrust
7099,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Its finger out at her,"
7100,UNDER THE ROSE.,Not much displeased I think
7101,UNDER THE ROSE.,To make a nine days' stir;
7102,UNDER THE ROSE.,The decent world would sink
7103,UNDER THE ROSE.,Its voice to speak of her.
7104,UNDER THE ROSE.,
7105,UNDER THE ROSE.,Now this is what I mean
7106,UNDER THE ROSE.,"To do, no more, no less:"
7107,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Never to speak, or show"
7108,UNDER THE ROSE.,Bare sign of what I know.
7109,UNDER THE ROSE.,Let the blot pass unseen;
7110,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Yea, let her never guess"
7111,UNDER THE ROSE.,I hold the tangled clew
7112,UNDER THE ROSE.,She huddles out of view.
7113,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Friend, servant, almost child,"
7114,UNDER THE ROSE.,So be it and nothing more
7115,UNDER THE ROSE.,On this side of the grave.
7116,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Mother, in Paradise,"
7117,UNDER THE ROSE.,You'll see with clearer eyes;
7118,UNDER THE ROSE.,Perhaps in this world even
7119,UNDER THE ROSE.,When you are like to die
7120,UNDER THE ROSE.,And face to face with Heaven
7121,UNDER THE ROSE.,You'll drop for once the lie:
7122,UNDER THE ROSE.,"But you must drop the mask, not I."
7123,UNDER THE ROSE.,
7124,UNDER THE ROSE.,My Lady promises
7125,UNDER THE ROSE.,Two hundred pounds with me
7126,UNDER THE ROSE.,Whenever I may wed
7127,UNDER THE ROSE.,A man she can approve:
7128,UNDER THE ROSE.,And since besides her bounty
7129,UNDER THE ROSE.,I'm fairest in the county
7130,UNDER THE ROSE.,"(For so I've heard it said,"
7131,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Though I don't vouch for this),"
7132,UNDER THE ROSE.,Her promised pounds may move
7133,UNDER THE ROSE.,Some honest man to see
7134,UNDER THE ROSE.,My virtues and my beauties;
7135,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Perhaps the rising grazier,"
7136,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Or temperance publican,"
7137,UNDER THE ROSE.,May claim my wifely duties.
7138,UNDER THE ROSE.,Meanwhile I wait their leisure
7139,UNDER THE ROSE.,"And grace-bestowing pleasure,"
7140,UNDER THE ROSE.,I wait the happy man;
7141,UNDER THE ROSE.,But if I hold my head
7142,UNDER THE ROSE.,And pitch my expectations
7143,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Just higher than their level,"
7144,UNDER THE ROSE.,They must fall back on patience:
7145,UNDER THE ROSE.,"I may not mean to wed,"
7146,UNDER THE ROSE.,Yet I'll be civil.
7147,UNDER THE ROSE.,
7148,UNDER THE ROSE.,Now sometimes in a dream
7149,UNDER THE ROSE.,My heart goes out of me
7150,UNDER THE ROSE.,"To build and scheme,"
7151,UNDER THE ROSE.,Till I sob after things that seem
7152,UNDER THE ROSE.,So pleasant in a dream:
7153,UNDER THE ROSE.,A home such as I see
7154,UNDER THE ROSE.,My blessed neighbors live in
7155,UNDER THE ROSE.,"With father and with mother,"
7156,UNDER THE ROSE.,"All proud of one another,"
7157,UNDER THE ROSE.,"Named by one common name,"
7158,UNDER THE ROSE.,From baby in the bud
7159,UNDER THE ROSE.,To full-blown workman father;
7160,UNDER THE ROSE.,It's little short of Heaven.
7161,UNDER THE ROSE.,I'd give my gentle blood
7162,UNDER THE ROSE.,To wash my special shame
7163,UNDER THE ROSE.,And drown my private grudge;
7164,UNDER THE ROSE.,I'd toil and moil much rather

9674,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As the flush of a Morning Sky,"
9675,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,As a Morning Sky colorless--
9676,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Each yields its measure of light
9677,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,To a wet world or a dry;
9678,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Each fares through day to night
9679,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"With equal pace,"
9680,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,And then each one
9681,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Is done.
9682,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9683,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,As the Sun with glory and grace
9684,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"In his face,"
9685,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Benignantly hot,"
9686,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Graciously radiant and keen,"
9687,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Ready to rise and to run,--"
9688,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Not without spot,"
9689,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Not even the Sun.
9690,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9691,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,As the Moon
9692,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"On the wax, on the wane,"
9693,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,With night for her noon;
9694,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Vanishing soon,"
9695,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,To appear again.
9696,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9697,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,As Roses that droop
9698,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Half warm, half chill, in the languid May,"
9699,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,And breathe out a scent
9700,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Sweet and faint;
9701,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Till the wind gives one swoop
9702,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,To scatter their beauty away.
9703,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9704,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As Lilies a multitude,"
9705,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"One dipping, one rising, one sinking,"
9706,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"On rippling waters, clear blue"
9707,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,And pure for their drinking;
9708,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"One new dead, and one opened anew,"
9709,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,And all good.
9710,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9711,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As a cankered pale Flower,"
9712,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"With death for a dower,"
9713,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Each hour of its life half dead;
9714,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,With death for a crown
9715,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Weighing down
9716,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Its head.
9717,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9718,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As an Eagle, half strength and half grace,"
9719,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Most potent to face
9720,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Unwinking the splendor of light;
9721,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Harrying the East and the West,"
9722,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Soaring aloft from our sight;
9723,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Yet one day or one night dropped to rest,"
9724,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,On the low common earth
9725,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Of his birth.
9726,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9727,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As a Dove,"
9728,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Not alone,"
9729,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,In a world of her own
9730,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Full of fluttering soft noises
9731,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,And tender sweet voices
9732,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Of love.
9733,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9734,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,As a Mouse
9735,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Keeping house
9736,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"In the fork of a tree,"
9737,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"With nuts in a crevice,"
9738,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,And an acorn or two;
9739,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,What cares he
9740,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"For blossoming boughs,"
9741,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Or the song-singing bevies
9742,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Of birds in their glee,"
9743,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Scarlet, or golden, or blue?"
9744,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9745,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,As a Mole grubbing underground;
9746,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,When it comes to the light
9747,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"It grubs its way back again,"
9748,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Feeling no bias of fur
9749,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"To hamper it in its stir,"
9750,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Scant of pleasure and pain,"
9751,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Sinking itself out of sight
9752,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Without sound.
9753,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9754,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As Waters that drop and drop,"
9755,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Weariness without end,"
9756,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"That drop and never stop,"
9757,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Wear that nothing can mend,"
9758,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Till one day they drop--
9759,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Stop--
9760,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"And there's an end,"
9761,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,And matters mend.
9762,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9763,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As Trees, beneath whose skin"
9764,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,We mark not the sap begin
9765,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"To swell and rise,"
9766,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Till the whole bursts out in green:
9767,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,We mark the falling leaves
9768,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,When the wide world grieves
9769,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,And sighs.
9770,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9771,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As a Forest on fire,"
9772,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Where maddened creatures desire
9773,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Wet mud or wings
9774,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Beyond all those things
9775,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Which could assuage desire
9776,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,On this side the flaming fire.
9777,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9778,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,As Wind with a sob and sigh
9779,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,To which there comes no reply
9780,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,But a rustle and shiver
9781,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,From rushes of the river;
9782,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As Wind with a desolate moan,"
9783,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Moaning on alone.
9784,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9785,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As a Desert all sand,"
9786,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Blank, neither water nor land"
9787,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"For solace, or dwelling, or culture,"
9788,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Where the storms and the wild creatures howl;
9789,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Given over to lion and vulture,"
9790,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"To ostrich, and jackal, and owl:"
9791,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Yet somewhere an oasis lies;
9792,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,There waters arise
9793,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"To nourish one seedling of balm,"
9794,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Perhaps, or one palm."
9795,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9796,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As the Sea,"
9797,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Murmuring, shifting, swaying;"
9798,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"One time sunnily playing,"
9799,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,One time wrecking and slaying;
9800,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"In whichever mood it be,"
9801,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Worst or best,"
9802,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Never at rest.
9803,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9804,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As still Waters and deep,"
9805,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As shallow Waters that brawl,"
9806,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,As rapid Waters that leap
9807,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,To their fall.
9808,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9809,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As Music, as Color, as Shape,"
9810,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Keys of rapture and pain
9811,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,Turning in vain
9812,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"In a lock which turns not again,"
9813,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,While breaths and moments escape.
9814,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9815,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As Spring, all bloom and desire;"
9816,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As Summer, all gift and fire;"
9817,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As Autumn, a dying glow;"
9818,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"As Winter, with nought to show:"
9819,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9820,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"Winter which lays its dead all out of sight,"
9821,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,"All clothed in white,"
9822,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,All waiting for the long-awaited light.
9823,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9824,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9825,MIRRORS OF LIFE AND DEATH.,
9826,A BALLAD OF BODING.,A BALLAD OF BODING.
9827,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9828,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9829,A BALLAD OF BODING.,There are sleeping dreams and waking dreams;
9830,A BALLAD OF BODING.,What seems is not always as it seems.
9831,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9832,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"I looked out of my window in the sweet new morning,"
9833,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And there I saw three barges of manifold adorning
9834,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Went sailing toward the East:
9835,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The first had sails like fire,"
9836,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The next like glittering wire,"
9837,A BALLAD OF BODING.,But sackcloth were the sails of the least;
9838,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"And all the crews made music, and two had spread a feast."
9839,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9840,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The first choir breathed in flutes,"
9841,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And fingered soft guitars;
9842,A BALLAD OF BODING.,The second won from lutes
9843,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Harmonious chords and jars,"
9844,A BALLAD OF BODING.,With drums for stormy bars:
9845,A BALLAD OF BODING.,But the third was all of harpers and scarlet trumpeters;
9846,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Notes of triumph, then"
9847,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"An alarm again,"
9848,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"As for onset, as for victory, rallies, stirs,"
9849,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Peace at last and glory to the vanquishers.
9850,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9851,A BALLAD OF BODING.,The first barge showed for figurehead a Love with wings;
9852,A BALLAD OF BODING.,The second showed for figurehead a Worm with stings;
9853,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The third, a Lily tangled to a Rose which clings."
9854,A BALLAD OF BODING.,The first bore for freight gold and spice and down;
9855,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The second bore a sword, a sceptre, and a crown;"
9856,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The third, a heap of earth gone to dust and brown."
9857,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Winged Love meseemed like Folly in the face;
9858,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Stinged Worm meseemed loathly in his place;
9859,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Lily and Rose were flowers of grace.
9860,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9861,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Merry went the revel of the fire-sailed crew,"
9862,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Singing, feasting, dancing to and fro:"
9863,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Pleasures ever changing, ever graceful, ever new;"
9864,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Sighs, but scarce of woe;"
9865,A BALLAD OF BODING.,All the sighing
9866,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Wooed such sweet replying;
9867,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"All the sighing, sweet and low,"
9868,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Used to come and go
9869,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"For more pleasure, merely so."
9870,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Yet at intervals some one grew tired
9871,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Of everything desired,"
9872,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"And sank, I knew not whither, in sorry plight,"
9873,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Out of sight.
9874,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9875,A BALLAD OF BODING.,The second crew seemed ever
9876,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Wider-visioned, graver,"
9877,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"More distinct of purpose, more sustained of will;"
9878,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"With heads erect and proud,"
9879,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And voices sometimes loud;
9880,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"With endless tacking, counter-tacking,"
9881,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"All things grasping, all things lacking,"
9882,A BALLAD OF BODING.,It would seem;
9883,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Ever shifting helm, or sail, or shroud,"
9884,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Drifting on as in a dream.
9885,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Hoarding to their utmost bent,"
9886,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Feasting to their fill,"
9887,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Yet gnawed by discontent,"
9888,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Envy, hatred, malice, on their road they went."
9889,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Their freight was not a treasure,"
9890,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Their music not a pleasure;
9891,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The sword flashed, cleaving through their bands,"
9892,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Sceptre and crown changed hands.
9893,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9894,A BALLAD OF BODING.,The third crew as they went
9895,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Seemed mostly different;
9896,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"They toiled in rowing, for to them the wind was contrary,"
9897,A BALLAD OF BODING.,As all the world might see.
9898,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"They labored at the oar,"
9899,A BALLAD OF BODING.,While on their heads they bore
9900,A BALLAD OF BODING.,The fiery stress of sunshine more and more.
9901,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"They labored at the oar hand-sore,"
9902,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Till rain went splashing,"
9903,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"And spray went dashing,"
9904,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Down on them, and up on them, more and more."
9905,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Their sails were patched and rent,"
9906,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Their masts were bent,"
9907,A BALLAD OF BODING.,In peril of their lives they worked and went.
9908,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"For them no feast was spread,"
9909,A BALLAD OF BODING.,No soft luxurious bed
9910,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Scented and white,"
9911,A BALLAD OF BODING.,No crown or sceptre hung in sight;
9912,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"In weariness and painfulness,"
9913,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"In thirst and sore distress,"
9914,A BALLAD OF BODING.,They rowed and steered from left to right
9915,A BALLAD OF BODING.,With all their might.
9916,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Their trumpeters and harpers round about
9917,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Incessantly played out,"
9918,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And sometimes they made answer with a shout;
9919,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"But oftener they groaned or wept,"
9920,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"And seldom paused to eat, and seldom slept."
9921,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"I wept for pity watching them, but more"
9922,A BALLAD OF BODING.,I wept heart-sore
9923,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Once and again to see
9924,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Some weary man plunge overboard, and swim"
9925,A BALLAD OF BODING.,To Love or Worm ship floating buoyantly:
9926,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And there all welcomed him.
9927,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9928,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The ships steered each apart and seemed to scorn each other,"
9929,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Yet all the crews were interchangeable;
9930,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Now one man, now another,"
9931,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"--Like bloodless spectres some, some flushed by health,--"
9932,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Changed openly, or changed by stealth,"
9933,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Scaling a slippery side, and scaled it well."
9934,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The most left Love ship, hauling wealth"
9935,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Up Worm ship's side;
9936,A BALLAD OF BODING.,While some few hollow-eyed
9937,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Left either for the sack-sailed boat;
9938,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"But this, though not remote,"
9939,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Was worst to mount, and whoso left it once"
9940,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Scarce ever came again,"
9941,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"But seemed to loathe his erst companions,"
9942,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And wish and work them bane.
9943,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9944,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Then I knew (I know not how) there lurked quicksands full of dread,"
9945,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Rocks and reefs and whirlpools in the water-bed,"
9946,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Whence a waterspout
9947,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Instantaneously leaped out,"
9948,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Roaring as it reared its head.
9949,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9950,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Soon I spied a something dim,"
9951,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Many-handed, grim,"
9952,A BALLAD OF BODING.,That went flitting to and fro the first and second ship;
9953,A BALLAD OF BODING.,It puffed their sails full out
9954,A BALLAD OF BODING.,With puffs of smoky breath
9955,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"From a smouldering lip,"
9956,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And cleared the waterspout
9957,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Which reeled roaring round about
9958,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Threatening death.
9959,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"With a horny hand it steered,"
9960,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And a horn appeared
9961,A BALLAD OF BODING.,On its sneering head upreared
9962,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Haughty and high
9963,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Against the blackening lowering sky.
9964,A BALLAD OF BODING.,With a hoof it swayed the waves;
9965,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"They opened here and there,"
9966,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Till I spied deep ocean graves
9967,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Full of skeletons
9968,A BALLAD OF BODING.,That were men and women once
9969,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Foul or fair;
9970,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Full of things that creep
9971,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And fester in the deep
9972,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And never breathe the clean life-nurturing air.
9973,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9974,A BALLAD OF BODING.,The third bark held aloof
9975,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"From the Monster with the hoof,"
9976,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Despite his urgent beck,"
9977,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And fraught with guile
9978,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Abominable his smile;
9979,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Till I saw him take a flying leap on to that deck.
9980,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Then full of awe,"
9981,A BALLAD OF BODING.,With these same eyes I saw
9982,A BALLAD OF BODING.,His head incredible retract its horn
9983,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Rounding like babe's new born,"
9984,A BALLAD OF BODING.,While silvery phosphorescence played
9985,A BALLAD OF BODING.,About his dis-horned head.
9986,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The sneer smoothed from his lip,"
9987,A BALLAD OF BODING.,He beamed blandly on the ship;
9988,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"All winds sank to a moan,"
9989,A BALLAD OF BODING.,All waves to a monotone
9990,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"(For all these seemed his realm),"
9991,A BALLAD OF BODING.,While he laid a strong caressing hand upon the helm.
9992,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
9993,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Then a cry well nigh of despair
9994,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Shrieked to heaven, a clamor of desperate prayer."
9995,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The harpers harped no more,"
9996,A BALLAD OF BODING.,While the trumpeters sounded sore
9997,A BALLAD OF BODING.,An alarm to wake the dead from their bed:
9998,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"To the rescue, to the rescue, now or never,"
9999,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"To the rescue, O ye living, O ye dead,"
10000,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Or no more help or hope for ever!--
10001,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The planks strained as though they must part asunder,"
10002,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The masts bent as though they must dip under,"
10003,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And the winds and the waves at length
10004,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Girt up their strength,"
10005,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"And the depths were laid bare,"
10006,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And heaven flashed fire and volleyed thunder
10007,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Through the rain-choked air,"
10008,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And sea and sky seemed to kiss
10009,A BALLAD OF BODING.,In the horror and the hiss
10010,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Of the whole world shuddering everywhere.
10011,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
10012,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Lo! a Flyer swooping down
10013,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"With wings to span the globe,"
10014,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And splendor for his robe
10015,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And splendor for his crown.
10016,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"He lighted on the helm with a foot of fire,"
10017,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And spun the Monster overboard:
10018,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"And that monstrous thing abhorred,"
10019,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Gnashing with balked desire,"
10020,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Wriggled like a worm infirm
10021,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Up the Worm
10022,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Of the loathly figurehead.
10023,A BALLAD OF BODING.,There he crouched and gnashed;
10024,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"And his head re-horned, and gashed"
10025,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"From the other's grapple, dripped bloody red."
10026,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
10027,A BALLAD OF BODING.,I saw that thing accurst
10028,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Wreak his worst
10029,A BALLAD OF BODING.,On the first and second crew:
10030,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Some with baited hook
10031,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"He angled for and took,"
10032,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Some dragged overboard in a net he threw,"
10033,A BALLAD OF BODING.,Some he did to death
10034,A BALLAD OF BODING.,With hoof or horn or blasting breath.
10035,A BALLAD OF BODING.,
10036,A BALLAD OF BODING.,I heard a voice of wailing
10037,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Where the ships went sailing,"
10038,A BALLAD OF BODING.,A sorrowful voice prevailing
10039,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Above the sound of the sea,"
10040,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Above the singers' voices,"
10041,A BALLAD OF BODING.,And musical merry noises;
10042,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"All songs had turned to sighing,"
10043,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"The light was failing,"
10044,A BALLAD OF BODING.,The day was dying--
10045,A BALLAD OF BODING.,"Ah me,"

11818,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,And me much sadder by its jubilee.
11819,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11820,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Therefore I sat me down: for wherefore walk?
11821,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,And closed mine eyes: for wherefore see or hear?
11822,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Alas, I had no shutter to mine ear,"
11823,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,And could not shun the talk
11824,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Of all rejoicing creatures far or near.
11825,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11826,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Without my will I hearkened and I heard
11827,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"(Asleep or waking, for I know not which),"
11828,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Till note by note the music changed its pitch;
11829,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Bird ceased to answer bird,"
11830,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,And every wind sighed softly if it stirred.
11831,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11832,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"The drip of widening waters seemed to weep,"
11833,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"All fountains sobbed and gurgled as they sprang,"
11834,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Somewhere a cataract cried out in its leap
11835,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Sheer down a headlong steep;
11836,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,High over all cloud-thunders gave a clang.
11837,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11838,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Such universal sound of lamentation
11839,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"I heard and felt, fain not to feel or hear;"
11840,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Nought else there seemed but anguish far and near;
11841,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Nought else but all creation
11842,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Moaning and groaning wrung by pain or fear,"
11843,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11844,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Shuddering in the misery of its doom:
11845,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"My heart then rose a rebel against light,"
11846,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Scouring all earth and heaven and depth and height,"
11847,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Ingathering wrath and gloom,"
11848,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Ingathering wrath to wrath and night to night.
11849,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11850,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Ah me, the bitterness of such revolt,"
11851,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"All impotent, all hateful, and all hate,"
11852,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,That kicks and breaks itself against the bolt
11853,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Of an imprisoning fate,"
11854,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"And vainly shakes, and cannot shake the gate."
11855,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11856,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Agony to agony, deep called to deep,"
11857,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Out of the deep I called of my desire;
11858,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,My strength was weakness and my heart was fire;
11859,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Mine eyes that would not weep
11860,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Or sleep, scaled height and depth, and could not sleep;"
11861,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11862,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"The eyes, I mean, of my rebellious soul,"
11863,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,For still my bodily eyes were closed and dark:
11864,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"A random thing I seemed without a mark,"
11865,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Racing without a goal,"
11866,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Adrift upon life's sea without an ark.
11867,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11868,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,More leaden than the actual self of lead
11869,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Outer and inner darkness weighed on me.
11870,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,The tide of anger ebbed. Then fierce and free
11871,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Surged full above my head
11872,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,The moaning tide of helpless misery.
11873,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11874,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Why should I breathe, whose breath was but a sigh?"
11875,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Why should I live, who drew such painful breath?"
11876,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Oh weary work, the unanswerable why!--"
11877,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Yet I, why should I die,"
11878,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Who had no hope in life, no hope in death?"
11879,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11880,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Grasses and mosses and the fallen leaf
11881,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Make peaceful bed for an indefinite term;
11882,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,But underneath the grass there gnaws a worm--
11883,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Haply, there gnaws a grief--"
11884,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Both, haply always; not, as now, so brief."
11885,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11886,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"The pleasure I remember, it is past;"
11887,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"The pain I feel is passing, passing by;"
11888,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Thus all the world is passing, and thus I:"
11889,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,All things that cannot last
11890,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Have grown familiar, and are born to die."
11891,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11892,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"And being familiar, have so long been borne"
11893,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,That habit trains us not to break but bend:
11894,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Mourning grows natural to us who mourn
11895,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"In foresight of an end,"
11896,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,But that which ends not who shall brave or mend?
11897,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11898,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Surely the ripe fruits tremble on their bough,"
11899,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,They cling and linger trembling till they drop:
11900,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"I, trembling, cling to dying life; for how"
11901,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Face the perpetual Now?
11902,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Birthless and deathless, void of start or stop,"
11903,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11904,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Void of repentance, void of hope and fear,"
11905,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Of possibility, alternative,"
11906,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Of all that ever made us bear to live
11907,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"From night to morning here,"
11908,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Of promise even which has no gift to give.
11909,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11910,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"The wood, and every creature of the wood,"
11911,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Seemed mourning with me in an undertone;
11912,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Soft scattered chirpings and a windy moan,"
11913,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Trees rustling where they stood
11914,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"And shivered, showed compassion for my mood."
11915,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11916,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Rage to despair; and now despair had turned
11917,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Back to self-pity and mere weariness,"
11918,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"With yearnings like a smouldering fire that burned,"
11919,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"And might grow more or less,"
11920,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,And might die out or wax to white excess.
11921,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11922,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Without, within me, music seemed to be;"
11923,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Something not music, yet most musical,"
11924,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Silence and sound in heavenly harmony;
11925,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,At length a pattering fall
11926,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Of feet, a bell, and bleatings, broke through all."
11927,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11928,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Then I looked up. The wood lay in a glow
11929,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,From golden sunset and from ruddy sky;
11930,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,The sun had stooped to earth though once so high;
11931,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Had stooped to earth, in slow"
11932,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Warm dying loveliness brought near and low.
11933,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11934,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Each water-drop made answer to the light,"
11935,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Lit up a spark and showed the sun his face;
11936,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Soft purple shadows paved the grassy space
11937,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"And crept from height to height,"
11938,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,From height to loftier height crept up apace.
11939,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11940,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,While opposite the sun a gazing moon
11941,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Put on his glory for her coronet,"
11942,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Kindling her luminous coldness to its noon,"
11943,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,As his great splendor set;
11944,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,One only star made up her train as yet.
11945,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11946,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Each twig was tipped with gold, each leaf was edged"
11947,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,And veined with gold from the gold-flooded west;
11948,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Each mother-bird, and mate-bird, and unfledged"
11949,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Nestling, and curious nest,"
11950,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Displayed a gilded moss or beak or breast.
11951,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11952,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"And filing peacefully between the trees,"
11953,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Having the moon behind them, and the sun"
11954,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Full in their meek mild faces, walked at ease"
11955,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"A homeward flock, at peace"
11956,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,With one another and with every one.
11957,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11958,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,A patriarchal ram with tinkling bell
11959,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Led all his kin; sometimes one browsing sheep
11960,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Hung back a moment, or one lamb would leap"
11961,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,And frolic in a dell;
11962,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Yet still they kept together, journeying well,"
11963,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,
11964,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"And bleating, one or other, many or few,"
11965,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Journeying together toward the sunlit west;
11966,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Mild face by face, and woolly breast by breast,"
11967,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,"Patient, sun-brightened too,"
11968,AN OLD-WORLD THICKET.,Still journeying toward the sunset and their rest.

13556,BROTHER BRUIN.,He in their midmost footed daily.
13557,BROTHER BRUIN.,Pandean pipes and drum and muzzle
13558,BROTHER BRUIN.,Were quite enough his brain to puzzle:
13559,BROTHER BRUIN.,But like a philosophic bear

13568,BROTHER BRUIN.,
13569,BROTHER BRUIN.,To looks succeeded blows; hard blows
13570,BROTHER BRUIN.,Battered his ears and poor old nose.
