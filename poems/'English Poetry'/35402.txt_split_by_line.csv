79,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,To my best and dearest friend I dedicate the first collected edition of
80,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"my poems, and to him I address what I have to say on the occasion."
81,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
82,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
83,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,You will agree with me that it is impossible for any man to undertake
84,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"the task of commentary, however brief and succinct, on anything he has"
85,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"done or tried to do, without incurring the charge of egoism. But there"
86,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"are two kinds of egoism, the furtive and the frank: and the outspoken"
87,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"and open-hearted candour of Milton and Wordsworth, Corneille and Hugo,"
88,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,is not the least or the lightest of their claims to the regard as well
89,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,as the respect or the reverence of their readers. Even if I were worthy
90,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,to claim kinship with the lowest or with the highest of these deathless
91,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"names, I would not seek to shelter myself under the shadow of its"
92,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,authority. The question would still remain open on all sides. Whether it
93,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,is worth while for any man to offer any remarks or for any other man to
94,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"read his remarks on his own work, his own ambition, or his own attempts,"
95,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,he cannot of course determine. If there are great examples of abstinence
96,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"from such a doubtful enterprise, there are likewise great examples to"
97,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the contrary. As long as the writer can succeed in evading the kindred
98,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"charges and the cognate risks of vanity and humility, there can be no"
99,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,reason why he should not undertake it. And when he has nothing to regret
100,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"and nothing to recant, when he finds nothing that he could wish to"
101,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"cancel, to alter, or to unsay, in any page he has ever laid before his"
102,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"reader, he need not be seriously troubled by the inevitable"
103,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,consciousness that the work of his early youth is not and cannot be
104,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,unnaturally unlike the work of a very young man. This would be no excuse
105,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"for it, if it were in any sense bad work: if it be so, no apology would"
106,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,avail; and I certainly have none to offer.
107,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
108,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"It is now thirty-six years since my first volume of miscellaneous verse,"
109,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"lyrical and dramatic and elegiac and generally heterogeneous, had as"
110,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,quaint a reception and as singular a fortune as I have ever heard or
111,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,read of. I do not think you will differ from my opinion that what is
112,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,best in it cannot be divided from what is not so good by any other line
113,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,of division than that which marks off mature from immature execution--in
114,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"other words, complete from incomplete conception. For its author the"
115,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,most amusing and satisfying result of the clatter aroused by it was the
116,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,deep diversion of collating and comparing the variously inaccurate
117,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,verdicts of the scornful or mournful censors who insisted on regarding
118,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,all the studies of passion or sensation attempted or achieved in it as
119,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,either confessions of positive fact or excursions of absolute fancy.
120,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,There are photographs from life in the book; and there are sketches from
121,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,imagination. Some which keen-sighted criticism has dismissed with a
122,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,smile as ideal or imaginary were as real and actual as they well could
123,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,be: others which have been taken for obvious transcripts from memory
124,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,were utterly fantastic or dramatic. If the two kinds cannot be
125,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"distinguished, it is surely rather a credit than a discredit to an"
126,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,artist whose medium or material has more in common with a musician's
127,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"than with a sculptor's. Friendly and kindly critics, English and"
128,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"foreign, have detected ignorance of the subject in poems taken straight"
129,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"from the life, and have protested that they could not believe me were I"
130,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,to swear that poems entirely or mainly fanciful were not faithful
131,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,expressions or transcriptions of the writer's actual experience and
132,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,personal emotion. But I need not remind you that all I have to say about
133,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,this book was said once for all in the year of its publication: I have
134,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"nothing to add to my notes then taken, and I have nothing to retract"
135,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"from them. To parade or to disclaim experience of passion or of sorrow,"
136,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"of pleasure or of pain, is the habit and the sign of a school which has"
137,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"never found a disciple among the better sort of English poets, and which"
138,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,I know to be no less pitifully contemptible in your opinion than in
139,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,mine.
140,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
141,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,In my next work it should be superfluous to say that there is no touch
142,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,of dramatic impersonation or imaginary emotion. The writer of 'Songs
143,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"before Sunrise,' from the first line to the last, wrote simply in"
144,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,submissive obedience to Sir Philip Sidney's precept--'Look in thine
145,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"heart, and write.' The dedication of these poems, and the fact that the"
146,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"dedication was accepted, must be sufficient evidence of this. They do"
147,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,not pretend and they were never intended to be merely the metrical
148,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"echoes, or translations into lyric verse, of another man's doctrine."
149,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Mazzini was no more a Pope or a Dictator than I was a parasite or a
150,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,papist. Dictation and inspiration are rather different things. These
151,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"poems, and others which followed or preceded them in print, were"
152,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,inspired by such faith as is born of devotion and reverence: not by such
153,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"faith, if faith it may be called, as is synonymous with servility or"
154,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,compatible with prostration of an abject or wavering spirit and a
155,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,submissive or dethroned intelligence. You know that I never pretended to
156,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"see eye to eye with my illustrious friends and masters, Victor Hugo and"
157,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Giuseppe Mazzini, in regard to the positive and passionate confidence of"
158,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,their sublime and purified theology. Our betters ought to know better
159,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,than we: they would be the last to wish that we should pretend to their
160,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"knowledge, or assume a certitude which is theirs and is not ours. But on"
161,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,one point we surely cannot but be at one with them: that the spirit and
162,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the letter of all other than savage and barbarous religions are
163,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"irreconcilably at variance, and that prayer or homage addressed to an"
164,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"image of our own or of other men's making, be that image avowedly"
165,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"material or conventionally spiritual, is the affirmation of idolatry"
166,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"with all its attendant atrocities, and the negation of all belief, all"
167,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"reverence, and all love, due to the noblest object of human worship that"
168,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,humanity can realise or conceive. Thus much the exercise of our common
169,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,reason might naturally suffice to show us: but when its evidence is
170,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,confirmed and fortified by the irrefragable and invariable evidence of
171,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"history, there is no room for further dispute or fuller argument on a"
172,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,subject now visibly beyond reach and eternally beyond need of debate or
173,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,demonstration. I know not whether it may or may not be worth while to
174,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,add that every passing word I have since thought fit to utter on any
175,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,national or political question has been as wholly consistent with the
176,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,principles which I then did my best to proclaim and defend as any
177,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,apostasy from the faith of all republicans in the fundamental and final
178,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"principle of union, voluntary if possible and compulsory if not, would"
179,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,have been ludicrous in the impudence of its inconsistency with those
180,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,simple and irreversible principles. Monarchists and anarchists may be
181,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,advocates of national dissolution and reactionary division: republicans
182,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,cannot be. The first and last article of their creed is unity: the most
183,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"grinding and crushing tyranny of a convention, a directory, or a despot,"
184,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,is less incompatible with republican faith than the fissiparous
185,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,democracy of disunionists or communalists.
186,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
187,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,If the fortunes of my lyrical work were amusingly eccentric and
188,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"accidental, the varieties of opinion which have saluted the appearance"
189,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"of my plays have been, or have seemed to my humility, even more"
190,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,diverting and curious. I have been told by reviewers of note and
191,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,position that a single one of them is worth all my lyric and otherwise
192,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,undramatic achievements or attempts: and I have been told on equal or
193,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"similar authority that, whatever I may be in any other field, as a"
194,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,dramatist I am demonstrably nothing. My first if not my strongest
195,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"ambition was to do something worth doing, and not utterly unworthy of a"
196,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,young countryman of Marlowe the teacher and Webster the pupil of
197,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Shakespeare, in the line of work which those three poets had left as a"
198,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,possibly unattainable example for ambitious Englishmen. And my first
199,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"book, written while yet under academic or tutorial authority, bore"
200,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,evidence of that ambition in every line. I should be the last to deny
201,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,that it also bore evidence of the fact that its writer had no more
202,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,notion of dramatic or theatrical construction than the authors of
203,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"'Tamburlaine the Great,' 'King Henry VI.,' and 'Sir Thomas Wyatt.' Not"
204,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"much more, you may possibly say, was discernible in 'Chastelard': a play"
205,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,also conceived and partly written by a youngster not yet emancipated
206,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,from servitude to college rule. I fear that in the former volume there
207,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,had been little if any promise of power to grapple with the realities
208,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,and subtleties of character and of motive: that whatever may be in it of
209,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,promise or of merit must be sought in the language and the style of such
210,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,better passages as may perhaps be found in single and separable speeches
211,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,of Catherine and of Rosamond. But in 'Chastelard' there are two figures
212,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,and a sketch in which I certainly seem to see something of real and
213,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,evident life. The sketch of Darnley was afterwards filled out and
214,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"finished in the subsequent tragedy of 'Bothwell.' That ambitious,"
215,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"conscientious, and comprehensive piece of work is of course less"
216,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,properly definable as a tragedy than by the old Shakespearean term of a
217,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,chronicle history. The radical difference between tragic history and
218,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"tragedy of either the classic or the romantic order, and consequently"
219,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,between the laws which govern the one and the principles which guide the
220,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"other, you have yourself made clear and familiar to all capable"
221,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"students. This play of mine was not, I think, inaccurately defined as an"
222,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,epic drama in the French verses of dedication which were acknowledged by
223,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the greatest of all French poets in a letter from which I dare only
224,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,quote one line of Olympian judgment and godlike generosity. 'Occuper ces
225,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"deux cimes, cela n'est donné qu'à vous.' Nor will I refrain from the"
226,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,confession that I cannot think it an epic or a play in which any one
227,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"part is sacrificed to any other, any subordinate figure mishandled or"
228,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,neglected or distorted or effaced for the sake of the predominant and
229,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"central person. And, though this has nothing or less than nothing to do"
230,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"with any question of poetic merit or demerit, of dramatic success or"
231,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"unsuccess, I will add that I took as much care and pains as though I had"
232,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,been writing or compiling a history of the period to do loyal justice to
233,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,all the historic figures which came within the scope of my dramatic or
234,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,poetic design. There is not one which I have designedly altered or
235,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,intentionally modified: it is of course for others to decide whether
236,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,there is one which is not the living likeness of an actual or imaginable
237,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,man.
238,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
239,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"The third part of this trilogy, as far as I know or remember, found"
240,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,favour only with the only man in England who could speak on the subject
241,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,of historic drama with the authority of an expert and a master. The
242,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,generally ungracious reception of 'Mary Stuart' gave me neither surprise
243,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,nor disappointment: the cordial approbation or rather the generous
244,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,applause of Sir Henry Taylor gave me all and more than all the
245,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,satisfaction I could ever have looked for in recompense of as much
246,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,painstaking and conscientious though interesting and enjoyable work as
247,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"can ever, I should imagine, have been devoted to the completion of any"
248,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,comparable design. Private and personal appreciation I have always
249,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,thought and often found more valuable and delightful than all possible
250,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,or imaginable clamour of public praise. This preference will perhaps be
251,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,supposed to influence my opinion if I avow that I think I have never
252,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,written anything worthier of such reward than the closing tragedy which
253,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,may or may not have deserved but which certainly received it.
254,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
255,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,My first attempt to do something original in English which might in some
256,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"degree reproduce for English readers the likeness of a Greek tragedy,"
257,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,with possibly something more of its true poetic life and charm than
258,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"could have been expected from the authors of 'Caractacus' and 'Merope,'"
259,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"was perhaps too exuberant and effusive in its dialogue, as it certainly"
260,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"was too irregular in the occasional license of its choral verse, to"
261,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,accomplish the design or achieve the success which its author should
262,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"have aimed at. It may or may not be too long as a poem: it is, I fear,"
263,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,too long for a poem of the kind to which it belongs or aims at
264,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,belonging. Poetical and mathematical truth are so different that I
265,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"doubt, however unwilling I may naturally be to doubt, whether it can"
266,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,truthfully be said of 'Atalanta in Calydon' that the whole is greater
267,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"than any part of it. I hope it may be, and I can honestly say no more."
268,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Of 'Erechtheus' I venture to believe with somewhat more confidence that
269,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"it can. Either poem, by the natural necessity of its kind and structure,"
270,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"has its crowning passage or passages which cannot, however much they may"
271,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"lose by detachment from their context, lose as much as the crowning"
272,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"scene or scenes of an English or Shakespearean play, as opposed to an"
273,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Æschylean or Sophoclean tragedy, must lose and ought to lose by a"
274,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"similar separation. The two best things in these two Greek plays, the"
275,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,antiphonal lamentation for the dying Meleager and the choral
276,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"presentation of stormy battle between the forces of land and sea, lose"
277,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,less by such division from the main body of the poem than would those
278,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,scenes in 'Bothwell' which deal with the turning-point in the life of
279,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Mary Stuart on the central and conclusive day of Carberry Hill.
280,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
281,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,It might be thought pedantic or pretentious in a modern poet to divide
282,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,his poems after the old Roman fashion into sections and classes; I must
283,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"confess that I should like to see this method applied, were it but by"
284,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"way of experiment in a single edition, to the work of the leading poets"
285,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"of our own country and century: to see, for instance, their lyrical and"
286,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"elegiac works ranged and registered apart, each kind in a class of its"
287,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"own, such as is usually reserved, I know not why, for sonnets only. The"
288,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"apparent formality of such an arrangement as would give us, for"
289,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"instance, the odes of Coleridge and Shelley collected into a distinct"
290,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,reservation or division might possibly be more than compensated to the
291,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,more capable among students by the gain in ethical or spiritual symmetry
292,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,and æsthetic or intellectual harmony. The ode or hymn--I need remind no
293,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,probable reader that the terms are synonymous in the speech of
294,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Pindar--asserts its primacy or pre-eminence over other forms of poetry
295,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,in the very name which defines or proclaims it as essentially the song;
296,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,as something above all less pure and absolute kinds of song by the very
297,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"nature and law of its being. The Greek form, with its regular"
298,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"arrangement of turn, return, and aftersong, is not to be imitated"
299,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"because it is Greek, but to be adopted because it is best: the very"
300,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"best, as a rule, that could be imagined for lyrical expression of the"
301,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,thing conceived or lyrical aspiration towards the aim imagined. The
302,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,rhythmic reason of its rigid but not arbitrary law lies simply and
303,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,solely in the charm of its regular variations. This can be given in
304,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"English as clearly and fully, if not so sweetly and subtly, as in Greek;"
305,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"and should, therefore, be expected and required in an English poem of"
306,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"the same nature and proportion. The Sapphic or Alcaic ode, a simple"
307,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"sequence of identical stanzas, could be imitated or revived in Latin by"
308,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,translators or disciples: the scheme of it is exquisitely adequate and
309,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"sufficient for comparatively short flights of passion or emotion, ardent"
310,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,or contemplative and personal or patriotic; but what can be done in
311,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"English could not be attempted in Latin. It seems strange to me, our"
312,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"language being what it is, that our literature should be no richer than"
313,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,it is in examples of the higher or at least the more capacious and
314,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,ambitious kind of ode. Not that the full Pindaric form of threefold or
315,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,triune structure need be or should be always adopted: but without an
316,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,accurately corresponsive or antiphonal scheme of music even the master
317,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"of masters, who is Coleridge, could not produce, even through the superb"
318,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"and enchanting melodies of such a poem as his 'Dejection,' a fit and"
319,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"complete companion, a full and perfect rival, to such a poem as his ode"
320,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,on France.
321,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
322,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,The title of ode may more properly and fairly be so extended as to cover
323,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,all lyrical poems in stanzas or couplets than so strained as to include
324,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,a lawless lyric of such irregular and uneven build as Coleridge only and
325,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,hardly could make acceptable or admissible among more natural and lawful
326,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"forms of poetry. Law, not lawlessness, is the natural condition of"
327,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"poetic life; but the law must itself be poetic and not pedantic, natural"
328,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,and not conventional. It would be a trivial precision or restriction
329,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,which would refuse the title of ode to the stanzas of Milton or the
330,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,heptameters of Aristophanes; that glorious form of lyric verse which a
331,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"critic of our own day, as you may not impossibly remember, has likened"
332,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,with such magnificent felicity of comparison to the gallop of the horses
333,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"of the sun. Nor, I presume, should this title be denied to a poem"
334,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,written in the more modest metre--more modest as being shorter by a
335,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,foot--which was chosen for those twin poems of antiphonal correspondence
336,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"in subject and in sound, the 'Hymn to Proserpine' and the 'Hymn of Man':"
337,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the deathsong of spiritual decadence and the birthsong of spiritual
338,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"renascence. Perhaps, too, my first stanzas addressed to Victor Hugo may"
339,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,be ranked as no less of an ode than that on the insurrection in Candia:
340,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"a poem which attracted, whether or not it may have deserved, the notice"
341,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"and commendation of Mazzini: from whom I received, on the occasion of"
342,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"its appearance, a letter which was the beginning of my personal"
343,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,intercourse with the man whom I had always revered above all other men
344,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,on earth. But for this happy accident I might not feel disposed to set
345,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,much store by my first attempt at a regular ode of orthodox or
346,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,legitimate construction; I doubt whether it quite succeeded in evading
347,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the criminal risk and the capital offence of formality; at least until
348,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the change of note in the closing epode gave fuller scope and freer play
349,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"of wing to the musical expression. But in my later ode on Athens,"
350,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,absolutely faithful as it is in form to the strictest type and the most
351,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"stringent law of Pindaric hymnology, I venture to believe that there is"
352,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,no more sign of this infirmity than in the less classically regulated
353,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"poem on the Armada; which, though built on a new scheme, is nevertheless"
354,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"in its way, I think, a legitimate ode, by right of its regularity in"
355,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,general arrangement of corresponsive divisions. By the test of these two
356,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,poems I am content that my claims should be decided and my station
357,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,determined as a lyric poet in the higher sense of the term; a craftsman
358,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,in the most ambitious line of his art that ever aroused or ever can
359,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,arouse the emulous aspiration of his kind.
360,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
361,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Even had I ever felt the same impulse to attempt and the same ambition
362,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,to achieve the enterprise of epic or narrative that I had always felt
363,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"with regard to lyric or dramatic work, I could never have proposed to"
364,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,myself the lowly and unambitious aim of competition with the work of so
365,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,notable a contemporary workman in the humbler branch of that line as
366,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,William Morris. No conception could have been further from my mind when
367,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,I undertook to rehandle the deathless legend of Tristram than that of so
368,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,modest and preposterous a trial of rivalry. My aim was simply to present
369,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"that story, not diluted and debased as it had been in our own time by"
370,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"other hands, but undefaced by improvement and undeformed by"
371,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"transformation, as it was known to the age of Dante wherever the"
372,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"chronicles of romance found hearing, from Ercildoune to Florence: and"
373,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"not in the epic or romantic form of sustained or continuous narrative,"
374,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,but mainly through a succession of dramatic scenes or pictures with
375,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,descriptive settings or backgrounds: the scenes being of the simplest
376,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"construction, duologue or monologue, without so much as the classically"
377,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,permissible intervention of a third or fourth person. It is only in our
378,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"native northern form of narrative poetry, on the old and unrivalled"
379,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"model of the English ballad, that I can claim to have done any work of"
380,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the kind worth reference: unless the story of Balen should be considered
381,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,as something other than a series or sequence of ballads. A more
382,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,plausible objection was brought to bear against 'Tristram of Lyonesse'
383,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,than that of failure in an enterprise which I never thought of
384,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,undertaking: the objection of an irreconcilable incongruity between the
385,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"incidents of the old legend and the meditations on man and nature, life"
386,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"and death, chance and destiny, assigned to a typical hero of chivalrous"
387,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,romance. And this objection might be unanswerable if the slightest
388,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,attempt had been made to treat the legend as in any possible sense
389,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,historical or capable of either rational or ideal association with
390,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"history, such as would assimilate the name and fame of Arthur to the"
391,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,name and fame of any actual and indisputable Alfred or Albert of the
392,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,future. But the age when these romances actually lived and flourished
393,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"side by side with the reviving legends of Thebes and Troy, not in the"
394,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,crude and bloodless forms of Celtic and archaic fancy but in the ampler
395,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"and manlier developments of Teutonic and mediæval imagination, was the"
396,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,age of Dante and of Chaucer: an age in which men were only too prone to
397,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"waste their time on the twin sciences of astrology and theology, to"
398,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,expend their energies in the jungle of pseudosophy or the morass of
399,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,metaphysics. There is surely nothing more incongruous or anachronic in
400,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the soliloquy of Tristram after his separation from Iseult than in the
401,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,lecture of Theseus after the obsequies of Arcite. Both heroes belong to
402,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the same impossible age of an imaginary world: and each has an equal
403,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"right, should it so please his chronicler, to reason in the pauses of"
404,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"action and philosophise in the intervals of adventure. After all, the"
405,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,active men of the actual age of chivalry were not all of them mere
406,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,muscular machines for martial or pacific exercise of their physical
407,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,functions or abilities.
408,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
409,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"You would agree, if the point were worth discussion, that it might"
410,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"savour somewhat of pretention, if not of affectation, to be over"
411,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,particular in arrangement of poems according to subject rather than
412,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"form, spirit rather than method, or motive rather than execution: and"
413,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,yet there might be some excuse for the fancy or the pedantry of such a
414,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"classification as should set apart, for example, poems inspired by the"
415,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"influence of places, whether seen but once or familiar for years or"
416,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,associated with the earliest memories within cognisance or record of the
417,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"mind, and poems inspired by the emotions of regard or regret for the"
418,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"living or the dead; above all, by the rare and profound passion of"
419,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,reverence and love and faith which labours and rejoices to find
420,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,utterance in some tributary sacrifice of song. Mere descriptive poetry
421,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,of the prepense and formal kind is exceptionally if not proverbially
422,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,liable to incur and to deserve the charge of dullness: it is unnecessary
423,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"to emphasise or obtrude the personal note, the presence or the emotion"
424,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"of a spectator, but it is necessary to make it felt and keep it"
425,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,perceptible if the poem is to have life in it or even a right to live:
426,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"felt as in Wordsworth's work it is always, perceptible as it is always"
427,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,in Shelley's. This note is more plain and positive than usual in the
428,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,poem which attempts--at once a simple and an ambitious attempt--to
429,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,render the contrast and the concord of night and day on Loch Torridon:
430,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"it is, I think, duly sensible though implicitly subdued in four poems of"
431,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"the West Undercliff, born or begotten of sunset in the bay and moonlight"
432,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"on the cliffs, noon or morning in a living and shining garden, afternoon"
433,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,or twilight on one left flowerless and forsaken. Not to you or any other
434,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"poet, nor indeed to the very humblest and simplest lover of poetry, will"
435,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"it seem incongruous or strange, suggestive of imperfect sympathy with"
436,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"life or deficient inspiration from nature, that the very words of Sappho"
437,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"should be heard and recognised in the notes of the nightingales, the"
438,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,glory of the presence of dead poets imagined in the presence of the
439,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"glory of the sky, the lustre of their advent and their passage felt"
440,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,visible as in vision on the live and limpid floorwork of the cloudless
441,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,and sunset-coloured sea. The half-brained creature to whom books are
442,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,other than living things may see with the eyes of a bat and draw with
443,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the fingers of a mole his dullard's distinction between books and life:
444,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,those who live the fuller life of a higher animal than he know that
445,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,books are to poets as much part of that life as pictures are to painters
446,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"or as music is to musicians, dead matter though they may be to the"
447,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,spiritually still-born children of dirt and dullness who find it
448,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,possible and natural to live while dead in heart and brain. Marlowe and
449,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Shakespeare, Æschylus and Sappho, do not for us live only on the dusty"
450,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,shelves of libraries.
451,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
452,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,It is hardly probable that especial and familiar love of places should
453,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,give any special value to verses written under the influence of their
454,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,charm: no intimacy of years and no association with the past gave any
455,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,colour of emotion to many other studies of English land and sea which
456,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,certainly are no less faithful and possibly have no less spiritual or
457,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"poetic life in them than the four to which I have just referred, whose"
458,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,localities lie all within the boundary of a mile or so. No contrast
459,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,could be stronger than that between the majestic and exquisite glory of
460,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"cliff and crag, lawn and woodland, garden and lea, to which I have done"
461,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,homage though assuredly I have not done justice in these four poems--'In
462,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"the Bay,' 'On the Cliffs,' 'A Forsaken Garden,' the dedication of 'The"
463,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Sisters'--and the dreary beauty, inhuman if not unearthly in its"
464,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"desolation, of the innumerable creeks and inlets, lined and paven with"
465,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"sea-flowers, which make of the salt marshes a fit and funereal setting,"
466,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"a fatal and appropriate foreground, for the supreme desolation of the"
467,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,relics of Dunwich; the beautiful and awful solitude of a wilderness on
468,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"which the sea has forbidden man to build or live, overtopped and bounded"
469,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,by the tragic and ghastly solitude of a headland on which the sea has
470,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,forbidden the works of human charity and piety to survive: between the
471,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,dense and sand-encumbered tides which are eating the desecrated wreck
472,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"and ruin of them all away, and the matchless magic, the ineffable"
473,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"fascination of the sea whose beauties and delights, whose translucent"
474,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,depths of water and divers-coloured banks of submarine foliage and
475,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"flowerage, but faintly reflected in the stanzas of the little ode 'Off"
476,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Shore,' complete the charm of the scenes as faintly sketched or shadowed"
477,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"forth in the poems just named, or the sterner and stranger magic of the"
478,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"seaboard to which tribute was paid in 'An Autumn Vision,' 'A Swimmer's"
479,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Dream,' 'On the South Coast,' 'Neap-tide': or, again, between the"
480,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,sterile stretches and sad limitless outlook of the shore which faces a
481,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"hitherto undetermined and interminable sea, and the joyful and fateful"
482,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,beauty of the seas off Bamborough and the seas about Sark and Guernsey.
483,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,But if there is enough of the human or personal note to bring into touch
484,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"the various poems which deal with these various impressions, there may"
485,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,perhaps be no less of it discernible in such as try to render the effect
486,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,of inland or woodland solitude--the splendid oppression of nature at
487,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,noon which found utterance of old in words of such singular and
488,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,everlasting significance as panic and nympholepsy.
489,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
490,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,The retrospect across many years over the many eulogistic and elegiac
491,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,poems which I have inscribed or devoted to the commemoration or the
492,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,panegyric of the living or the dead has this in it of pride and
493,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"pleasure, that I find little to recant and nothing to repent on"
494,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,reconsideration of them all. If ever a word of tributary thanksgiving
495,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,for the delight and the benefit of loyal admiration evoked in the spirit
496,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,of a boy or aroused in the intelligence of a man may seem to exceed the
497,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"limit of demonstrable accuracy, I have no apology to offer for any such"
498,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,aberration from the safe path of tepid praise or conventional applause.
499,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,I can truly say with Shelley that I have been fortunate in friendships:
500,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"I might add if I cared, as he if he had cared might have added, that I"
501,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"have been no less fortunate in my enemies than in my friends; and this,"
502,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"though by comparison a matter of ineffable insignificance, can hardly be"
503,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,to any rational and right-minded man a matter of positive indifference.
504,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Rather should it be always a subject for thankfulness and
505,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,self-congratulation if a man can honestly and reasonably feel assured
506,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,that his friends and foes alike have been always and at almost all
507,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"points the very men he would have chosen, had choice and foresight been"
508,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"allowed him, at the very outset of his career in life. I should never,"
509,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"when a boy, have dared to dream that as a man I might possibly be"
510,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"admitted to the personal acquaintance of the three living gods, I do not"
511,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"say of my idolatry, for idolatry is a term inapplicable where the gods"
512,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"are real and true, but of my whole-souled and single-hearted worship:"
513,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"and yet, when writing of Landor, of Mazzini, and of Hugo, I write of men"
514,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,who have honoured me with the assurance and the evidence of their
515,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,cordial and affectionate regard. However inadequate and unworthy may be
516,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"my tribute to their glory when living and their memory when dead, it is"
517,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,that of one whose gratitude and devotion found unforgettable favour in
518,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,their sight. And I must be allowed to add that the redeeming quality of
519,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,entire and absolute sincerity may be claimed on behalf of every line I
520,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"have written in honour of friends, acquaintances, or strangers. My"
521,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,tribute to Richard Burton was not more genuine in its expression than my
522,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,tribute to Christina Rossetti. Two noble human creatures more utterly
523,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,unlike each other it would be unspeakably impossible to conceive; but it
524,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,was as simply natural for one who honoured them both to do honest
525,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"homage, before and after they had left us, to the saintly and secluded"
526,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,poetess as to the adventurous and unsaintly hero. Wherever anything is
527,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,worthy of honour and thanksgiving it is or it always should be as
528,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,natural if not as delightful to give thanks and do honour to a stranger
529,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"as to a friend, to a benefactor long since dead as to a benefactor still"
530,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,alive. To the kindred spirits of Philip Sidney and Aurelio Saffi it was
531,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,almost as equal a pleasure to offer what tribute I could bring as if
532,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Sidney also could have honoured me with his personal friendship. To
533,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Tennyson and Browning it was no less fit that I should give honour than
534,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"that I should do homage to the memory of Bruno, the martyred friend of"
535,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Sidney. And I can hardly remember any task that I ever took more delight
536,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,in discharging than I felt in the inadequate and partial payment of a
537,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,lifelong debt to the marvellous and matchless succession of poets who
538,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,made the glory of our country incomparable for ever by the work they did
539,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,between the joyful date of the rout of the Armada and the woful date of
540,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the outbreak of civil war.
541,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
542,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Charles Lamb, as I need not remind you, wrote for antiquity: nor need"
543,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,you be assured that when I write plays it is with a view to their being
544,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"acted at the Globe, the Red Bull, or the Black Friars. And whatever may"
545,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"be the dramatic or other defects of 'Marino Faliero' or 'Locrine,' they"
546,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,do certainly bear the same relation to previous plays or attempts at
547,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,plays on the same subjects as 'King Henry V.' to 'The Famous
548,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Victories'--if not as 'King Lear,' a poem beyond comparison with all"
549,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"other works of man except possibly 'Prometheus' and 'Othello,' to the"
550,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,primitive and infantile scrawl or drivel of 'King Leir and his three
551,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"daughters.' The fifth act of 'Marino Faliero,' hopelessly impossible as"
552,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"it is from the point of view of modern stagecraft, could hardly have"
553,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"been found too untheatrical, too utterly given over to talk without"
554,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"action, by the audiences which endured and applauded the magnificent"
555,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,monotony of Chapman's eloquence--the fervent and inexhaustible
556,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,declamation which was offered and accepted as a substitute for study of
557,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"character and interest of action when his two finest plays, if plays"
558,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"they can be called, found favour with an incredibly intelligent and an"
559,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,inconceivably tolerant audience. The metrical or executive experiment
560,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,attempted and carried through in 'Locrine' would have been improper to
561,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,any but a purely and wholly romantic play or poem: I do not think that
562,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,the life of human character or the lifelikeness of dramatic dialogue has
563,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,suffered from the bondage of rhyme or has been sacrificed to the
564,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"exigence of metre. The tragedy of 'The Sisters,' however defective it"
565,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"may be in theatrical interest or progressive action, is the only modern"
566,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,English play I know in which realism in the reproduction of natural
567,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,dialogue and accuracy in the representation of natural intercourse
568,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,between men and women of gentle birth and breeding have been found or
569,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,made compatible with expression in genuine if simple blank verse. It is
570,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,not for me to decide whether anything in the figures which play their
571,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"parts on my imaginary though realistic stage may be worthy of sympathy,"
572,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"attention, or interest: but I think they talk and act as they would have"
573,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,done in life without ever lapsing into platitude or breaking out of
574,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,nature.
575,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
576,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"In 'Rosamund, Queen of the Lombards,' I took up a subject long since"
577,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"mishandled by an English dramatist of all but the highest rank, and one"
578,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,which in later days Alfieri had commemorated in a magnificent passage of
579,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,a wholly unhistoric and somewhat unsatisfactory play. The comparatively
580,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,slight deviation from historic records in the final catastrophe or
581,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"consummation of mine is not, I think, to say the least, injurious to the"
582,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,tragic effect or the moral interest of the story.
583,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,
584,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,A writer conscious of any natural command over the musical resources of
585,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,his language can hardly fail to take such pleasure in the enjoyment of
586,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,this gift or instinct as the greatest writer and the greatest versifier
587,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,of our age must have felt at its highest possible degree when composing
588,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,a musical exercise of such incomparable scope and fullness as 'Les
589,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Djinns.' But if he be a poet after the order of Hugo or Coleridge or
590,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Shelley, the result will be something very much more than a musical"
591,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"exercise; though indeed, except to such ears as should always be kept"
592,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"closed against poetry, there is no music in verse which has not in it"
593,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"sufficient fullness and ripeness of meaning, sufficient adequacy of"
594,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"emotion or of thought, to abide the analysis of any other than the"
595,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,purblind scrutiny of prepossession or the squint-eyed inspection of
596,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,malignity. There may perhaps be somewhat more depth and variety of
597,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,feeling or reflection condensed into the narrow frame of the poems which
598,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,compose 'A Century of Roundels' than would be needed to fulfil the epic
599,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,vacuity of a Choerilus or a Coluthus. And the form chosen for my only
600,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,narrative poem was chosen as a test of the truth of my conviction that
601,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,such work could be done better on the straitest and the strictest
602,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,principles of verse than on the looser and more slippery lines of
603,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,mediæval or modern improvisation. The impulsive and irregular verse
604,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,which had been held sufficient for the stanza selected or accepted by
605,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Thornton and by Tennyson seemed capable of improvement and invigoration
606,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,as a vehicle or a medium for poetic narrative. And I think it has not
607,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,been found unfit to give something of dignity as well as facility to a
608,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,narrative which recasts in modern English verse one of the noblest and
609,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,loveliest old English legends. There is no episode in the cycle of
610,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Arthurian romance more genuinely Homeric in its sublime simplicity and
611,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,its pathetic sublimity of submission to the masterdom of fate than that
612,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,which I have rather reproduced than recast in 'The Tale of Balen': and
613,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,impossible as it is to render the text or express the spirit of the
614,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"Iliad in English prose or rhyme--above all, in English blank verse--it"
615,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"is possible, in such a metre as was chosen and refashioned for this"
616,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,"poem, to give some sense of the rage and rapture of battle for which"
617,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,Homer himself could only find fit and full expression by similitudes
618,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,drawn like mine from the revels and the terrors and the glories of the
619,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,sea.
620,DEDICATORY EPISTLE,

722,A BALLAD OF LIFE,A BALLAD OF LIFE
723,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
724,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
725,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"I found in dreams a place of wind and flowers,"
726,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Full of sweet trees and colour of glad grass,"
727,A BALLAD OF LIFE,In midst whereof there was
728,A BALLAD OF LIFE,A lady clothed like summer with sweet hours.
729,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Her beauty, fervent as a fiery moon,"
730,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Made my blood burn and swoon
731,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Like a flame rained upon.
732,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Sorrow had filled her shaken eyelids' blue,"
733,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And her mouth's sad red heavy rose all through
734,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Seemed sad with glad things gone.
735,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
736,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"She held a little cithern by the strings,"
737,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Shaped heartwise, strung with subtle-coloured hair"
738,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Of some dead lute-player
739,A BALLAD OF LIFE,That in dead years had done delicious things.
740,A BALLAD OF LIFE,The seven strings were named accordingly;
741,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The first string charity,"
742,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The second tenderness,"
743,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The rest were pleasure, sorrow, sleep, and sin,"
744,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"And loving-kindness, that is pity's kin"
745,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And is most pitiless.
746,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
747,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"There were three men with her, each garmented"
748,A BALLAD OF LIFE,With gold and shod with gold upon the feet;
749,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And with plucked ears of wheat
750,A BALLAD OF LIFE,The first man's hair was wound upon his head:
751,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"His face was red, and his mouth curled and sad;"
752,A BALLAD OF LIFE,All his gold garment had
753,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Pale stains of dust and rust.
754,A BALLAD OF LIFE,A riven hood was pulled across his eyes;
755,A BALLAD OF LIFE,The token of him being upon this wise
756,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Made for a sign of Lust.
757,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
758,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The next was Shame, with hollow heavy face"
759,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Coloured like green wood when flame kindles it.
760,A BALLAD OF LIFE,He hath such feeble feet
761,A BALLAD OF LIFE,They may not well endure in any place.
762,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"His face was full of grey old miseries,"
763,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And all his blood's increase
764,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Was even increase of pain.
765,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"The last was Fear, that is akin to Death;"
766,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"He is Shame's friend, and always as Shame saith"
767,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Fear answers him again.
768,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
769,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"My soul said in me; This is marvellous,"
770,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Seeing the air's face is not so delicate
771,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Nor the sun's grace so great,"
772,A BALLAD OF LIFE,If sin and she be kin or amorous.
773,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"And seeing where maidens served her on their knees,"
774,A BALLAD OF LIFE,I bade one crave of these
775,A BALLAD OF LIFE,To know the cause thereof.
776,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Then Fear said: I am Pity that was dead.
777,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And Shame said: I am Sorrow comforted.
778,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And Lust said: I am Love.
779,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
780,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Thereat her hands began a lute-playing
781,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And her sweet mouth a song in a strange tongue;
782,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And all the while she sung
783,A BALLAD OF LIFE,There was no sound but long tears following
784,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Long tears upon men's faces, waxen white"
785,A BALLAD OF LIFE,With extreme sad delight.
786,A BALLAD OF LIFE,But those three following men
787,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Became as men raised up among the dead;
788,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Great glad mouths open and fair cheeks made red
789,A BALLAD OF LIFE,With child's blood come again.
790,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
791,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Then I said: Now assuredly I see
792,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"My lady is perfect, and transfigureth"
793,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"All sin and sorrow and death,"
794,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Making them fair as her own eyelids be,"
795,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Or lips wherein my whole soul's life abides;
796,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Or as her sweet white sides
797,A BALLAD OF LIFE,And bosom carved to kiss.
798,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Now therefore, if her pity further me,"
799,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Doubtless for her sake all my days shall be
800,A BALLAD OF LIFE,As righteous as she is.
801,A BALLAD OF LIFE,
802,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Forth, ballad, and take roses in both arms,"
803,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Even till the top rose touch thee in the throat
804,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Where the least thornprick harms;
805,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"And girdled in thy golden singing-coat,"
806,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Come thou before my lady and say this;
807,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Borgia, thy gold hair's colour burns in me,"
808,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Thy mouth makes beat my blood in feverish rhymes;
809,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Therefore so many as these roses be,"
810,A BALLAD OF LIFE,Kiss me so many times.
811,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Then it may be, seeing how sweet she is,"
812,A BALLAD OF LIFE,That she will stoop herself none otherwise
813,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Than a blown vine-branch doth,"
814,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"And kiss thee with soft laughter on thine eyes,"
815,A BALLAD OF LIFE,"Ballad, and on thy mouth."

821,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
822,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
823,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Kneel down, fair Love, and fill thyself with tears,"
824,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth
825,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Upon the sides of mirth,"
826,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Cover thy lips and eyelids, let thine ears"
827,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing;
828,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Make thee soft raiment out of woven sighs
829,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Upon the flesh to cleave,"
830,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Set pains therein and many a grievous thing,"
831,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And many sorrows after each his wise
832,A BALLAD OF DEATH,For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve.
833,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
834,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"O Love's lute heard about the lands of death,"
835,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Left hanged upon the trees that were therein;
836,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"O Love and Time and Sin,"
837,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Three singing mouths that mourn now underbreath,"
838,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Three lovers, each one evil spoken of;"
839,A BALLAD OF DEATH,O smitten lips wherethrough this voice of mine
840,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Came softer with her praise;
841,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Abide a little for our lady's love.
842,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"The kisses of her mouth were more than wine,"
843,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And more than peace the passage of her days.
844,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
845,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"O Love, thou knowest if she were good to see."
846,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"O Time, thou shalt not find in any land"
847,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Till, cast out of thine hand,"
848,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"The sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee,"
849,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Another woman fashioned like as this.
850,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"O Sin, thou knowest that all thy shame in her"
851,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Was made a goodly thing;
852,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Yea, she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss,"
853,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"With her fair kiss, and lips much lovelier"
854,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Than lips of amorous roses in late spring.
855,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
856,A BALLAD OF DEATH,By night there stood over against my bed
857,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black,"
858,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Both sides drawn fully back
859,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red,"
860,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And temples drained of purple and full of death.
861,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water
862,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And the sea's gold in it.
863,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Her eyes were as a dove's that sickeneth.
864,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Strewn dust of gold she had shed over her,"
865,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And pearl and purple and amber on her feet.
866,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
867,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Upon her raiment of dyed sendaline
868,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Were painted all the secret ways of love
869,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"And covered things thereof,"
870,A BALLAD OF DEATH,That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine;
871,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Red mouths of maidens and red feet of doves,"
872,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And brides that kept within the bride-chamber
873,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Their garment of soft shame,"
874,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And weeping faces of the wearied loves
875,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"That swoon in sleep and awake wearier,"
876,A BALLAD OF DEATH,With heat of lips and hair shed out like flame.
877,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
878,A BALLAD OF DEATH,The tears that through her eyelids fell on me
879,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Made mine own bitter where they ran between
880,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"As blood had fallen therein,"
881,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"She saying; Arise, lift up thine eyes and see"
882,A BALLAD OF DEATH,If any glad thing be or any good
883,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Now the best thing is taken forth of us;
884,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Even she to whom all praise
885,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Was as one flower in a great multitude,"
886,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"One glorious flower of many and glorious,"
887,A BALLAD OF DEATH,One day found gracious among many days:
888,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
889,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Even she whose handmaiden was Love--to whom
890,A BALLAD OF DEATH,At kissing times across her stateliest bed
891,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Kings bowed themselves and shed
892,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Pale wine, and honey with the honeycomb,"
893,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering;
894,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Even she between whose lips the kiss became
895,A BALLAD OF DEATH,As fire and frankincense;
896,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king,"
897,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Whose eyes were as the morning purged with flame,"
898,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence.
899,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
900,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Then I beheld, and lo on the other side"
901,A BALLAD OF DEATH,My lady's likeness crowned and robed and dead.
902,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Sweet still, but now not red,"
903,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died.
904,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"And sweet, but emptied of the blood's blue shade,"
905,A BALLAD OF DEATH,The great curled eyelids that withheld her eyes.
906,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"And sweet, but like spoilt gold,"
907,A BALLAD OF DEATH,The weight of colour in her tresses weighed.
908,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"And sweet, but as a vesture with new dyes,"
909,A BALLAD OF DEATH,The body that was clothed with love of old.
910,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
911,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Ah! that my tears filled all her woven hair
912,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And all the hollow bosom of her gown--
913,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Ah! that my tears ran down
914,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Even to the place where many kisses were,"
915,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Even where her parted breast-flowers have place,"
916,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Even where they are cloven apart--who knows not this?
917,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Ah! the flowers cleave apart
918,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And their sweet fills the tender interspace;
919,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Ah! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss
920,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Ere their fine gold was tarnished at the heart.
921,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
922,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Ah! in the days when God did good to me,"
923,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Each part about her was a righteous thing;
924,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Her mouth an almsgiving,"
925,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"The glory of her garments charity,"
926,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"The beauty of her bosom a good deed,"
927,A BALLAD OF DEATH,In the good days when God kept sight of us;
928,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Love lay upon her eyes,"
929,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And on that hair whereof the world takes heed;
930,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And all her body was more virtuous
931,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Than souls of women fashioned otherwise.
932,A BALLAD OF DEATH,
933,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Now, ballad, gather poppies in thine hands"
934,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves
935,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Rain-rotten in rank lands,"
936,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Waste marigold and late unhappy leaves
937,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And grass that fades ere any of it be mown;
938,A BALLAD OF DEATH,And when thy bosom is filled full thereof
939,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Seek out Death's face ere the light altereth,"
940,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"And say ""My master that was thrall to Love"
941,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Is become thrall to Death."""
942,A BALLAD OF DEATH,"Bow down before him, ballad, sigh and groan,"
943,A BALLAD OF DEATH,But make no sojourn in thy outgoing;
944,A BALLAD OF DEATH,For haply it may be
945,A BALLAD OF DEATH,That when thy feet return at evening
946,A BALLAD OF DEATH,Death shall come in with thee.

979,LAUS VENERIS,
980,LAUS VENERIS,"Asleep or waking is it? for her neck,"
981,LAUS VENERIS,"Kissed over close, wears yet a purple speck"
982,LAUS VENERIS,Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out;
983,LAUS VENERIS,"Soft, and stung softly--fairer for a fleck."
984,LAUS VENERIS,
985,LAUS VENERIS,"But though my lips shut sucking on the place,"
986,LAUS VENERIS,There is no vein at work upon her face;
987,LAUS VENERIS,"Her eyelids are so peaceable, no doubt"
988,LAUS VENERIS,Deep sleep has warmed her blood through all its ways.
989,LAUS VENERIS,
990,LAUS VENERIS,"Lo, this is she that was the world's delight;"
991,LAUS VENERIS,The old grey years were parcels of her might;
992,LAUS VENERIS,The strewings of the ways wherein she trod
993,LAUS VENERIS,Were the twain seasons of the day and night.
994,LAUS VENERIS,
995,LAUS VENERIS,"Lo, she was thus when her clear limbs enticed"
996,LAUS VENERIS,"All lips that now grow sad with kissing Christ,"
997,LAUS VENERIS,"Stained with blood fallen from the feet of God,"
998,LAUS VENERIS,The feet and hands whereat our souls were priced.
999,LAUS VENERIS,
1000,LAUS VENERIS,"Alas, Lord, surely thou art great and fair."
1001,LAUS VENERIS,But lo her wonderfully woven hair!
1002,LAUS VENERIS,And thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss;
1003,LAUS VENERIS,"But see now, Lord; her mouth is lovelier."
1004,LAUS VENERIS,
1005,LAUS VENERIS,She is right fair; what hath she done to thee?
1006,LAUS VENERIS,"Nay, fair Lord Christ, lift up thine eyes and see;"
1007,LAUS VENERIS,Had now thy mother such a lip--like this?
1008,LAUS VENERIS,Thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me.
1009,LAUS VENERIS,
1010,LAUS VENERIS,Inside the Horsel here the air is hot;
1011,LAUS VENERIS,"Right little peace one hath for it, God wot;"
1012,LAUS VENERIS,"The scented dusty daylight burns the air,"
1013,LAUS VENERIS,And my heart chokes me till I hear it not.
1014,LAUS VENERIS,
1015,LAUS VENERIS,"Behold, my Venus, my soul's body, lies"
1016,LAUS VENERIS,"With my love laid upon her garment-wise,"
1017,LAUS VENERIS,Feeling my love in all her limbs and hair
1018,LAUS VENERIS,And shed between her eyelids through her eyes.
1019,LAUS VENERIS,
1020,LAUS VENERIS,She holds my heart in her sweet open hands
1021,LAUS VENERIS,"Hanging asleep; hard by her head there stands,"
1022,LAUS VENERIS,"Crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire,"
1023,LAUS VENERIS,"Love, wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands--"
1024,LAUS VENERIS,
1025,LAUS VENERIS,Hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume
1026,LAUS VENERIS,That shift and steam--loose clots of arid fume
1027,LAUS VENERIS,From the sea's panting mouth of dry desire;
1028,LAUS VENERIS,"There stands he, like one labouring at a loom."
1029,LAUS VENERIS,
1030,LAUS VENERIS,The warp holds fast across; and every thread
1031,LAUS VENERIS,That makes the woof up has dry specks of red;
1032,LAUS VENERIS,"Always the shuttle cleaves clean through, and he"
1033,LAUS VENERIS,Weaves with the hair of many a ruined head.
1034,LAUS VENERIS,
1035,LAUS VENERIS,"Love is not glad nor sorry, as I deem;"
1036,LAUS VENERIS,"Labouring he dreams, and labours in the dream,"
1037,LAUS VENERIS,"Till when the spool is finished, lo I see"
1038,LAUS VENERIS,"His web, reeled off, curls and goes out like steam."
1039,LAUS VENERIS,
1040,LAUS VENERIS,"Night falls like fire; the heavy lights run low,"
1041,LAUS VENERIS,"And as they drop, my blood and body so"
1042,LAUS VENERIS,"Shake as the flame shakes, full of days and hours"
1043,LAUS VENERIS,That sleep not neither weep they as they go.
1044,LAUS VENERIS,
1045,LAUS VENERIS,Ah yet would God this flesh of mine might be
1046,LAUS VENERIS,"Where air might wash and long leaves cover me,"
1047,LAUS VENERIS,"Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers,"
1048,LAUS VENERIS,Or where the wind's feet shine along the sea.
1049,LAUS VENERIS,
1050,LAUS VENERIS,Ah yet would God that stems and roots were bred
1051,LAUS VENERIS,"Out of my weary body and my head,"
1052,LAUS VENERIS,"That sleep were sealed upon me with a seal,"
1053,LAUS VENERIS,And I were as the least of all his dead.
1054,LAUS VENERIS,
1055,LAUS VENERIS,"Would God my blood were dew to feed the grass,"
1056,LAUS VENERIS,"Mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass,"
1057,LAUS VENERIS,"My body broken as a turning wheel,"
1058,LAUS VENERIS,And my mouth stricken ere it saith Alas!
1059,LAUS VENERIS,
1060,LAUS VENERIS,"Ah God, that love were as a flower or flame,"
1061,LAUS VENERIS,"That life were as the naming of a name,"
1062,LAUS VENERIS,"That death were not more pitiful than desire,"
1063,LAUS VENERIS,That these things were not one thing and the same!
1064,LAUS VENERIS,
1065,LAUS VENERIS,"Behold now, surely somewhere there is death:"
1066,LAUS VENERIS,"For each man hath some space of years, he saith,"
1067,LAUS VENERIS,"A little space of time ere time expire,"
1068,LAUS VENERIS,"A little day, a little way of breath."
1069,LAUS VENERIS,
1070,LAUS VENERIS,"And lo, between the sundawn and the sun,"
1071,LAUS VENERIS,His day's work and his night's work are undone;
1072,LAUS VENERIS,"And lo, between the nightfall and the light,"
1073,LAUS VENERIS,"He is not, and none knoweth of such an one."
1074,LAUS VENERIS,
1075,LAUS VENERIS,"Ah God, that I were as all souls that be,"
1076,LAUS VENERIS,"As any herb or leaf of any tree,"
1077,LAUS VENERIS,"As men that toil through hours of labouring night,"
1078,LAUS VENERIS,As bones of men under the deep sharp sea.
1079,LAUS VENERIS,
1080,LAUS VENERIS,Outside it must be winter among men;
1081,LAUS VENERIS,For at the gold bars of the gates again
1082,LAUS VENERIS,I heard all night and all the hours of it
1083,LAUS VENERIS,The wind's wet wings and fingers drip with rain.
1084,LAUS VENERIS,
1085,LAUS VENERIS,"Knights gather, riding sharp for cold; I know"
1086,LAUS VENERIS,The ways and woods are strangled with the snow;
1087,LAUS VENERIS,And with short song the maidens spin and sit
1088,LAUS VENERIS,"Until Christ's birthnight, lily-like, arow."
1089,LAUS VENERIS,
1090,LAUS VENERIS,The scent and shadow shed about me make
1091,LAUS VENERIS,The very soul in all my senses ache;
1092,LAUS VENERIS,"The hot hard night is fed upon my breath,"
1093,LAUS VENERIS,And sleep beholds me from afar awake.
1094,LAUS VENERIS,
1095,LAUS VENERIS,"Alas, but surely where the hills grow deep,"
1096,LAUS VENERIS,"Or where the wild ways of the sea are steep,"
1097,LAUS VENERIS,"Or in strange places somewhere there is death,"
1098,LAUS VENERIS,And on death's face the scattered hair of sleep.
1099,LAUS VENERIS,
1100,LAUS VENERIS,There lover-like with lips and limbs that meet
1101,LAUS VENERIS,"They lie, they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat;"
1102,LAUS VENERIS,"But me the hot and hungry days devour,"
1103,LAUS VENERIS,And in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet.
1104,LAUS VENERIS,
1105,LAUS VENERIS,"No fruit of theirs, but fruit of my desire,"
1106,LAUS VENERIS,For her love's sake whose lips through mine respire;
1107,LAUS VENERIS,"Her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower,"
1108,LAUS VENERIS,Mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire.
1109,LAUS VENERIS,
1110,LAUS VENERIS,"So lie we, not as sleep that lies by death,"
1111,LAUS VENERIS,With heavy kisses and with happy breath;
1112,LAUS VENERIS,"Not as man lies by woman, when the bride"
1113,LAUS VENERIS,Laughs low for love's sake and the words he saith.
1114,LAUS VENERIS,
1115,LAUS VENERIS,"For she lies, laughing low with love; she lies"
1116,LAUS VENERIS,"And turns his kisses on her lips to sighs,"
1117,LAUS VENERIS,"To sighing sound of lips unsatisfied,"
1118,LAUS VENERIS,And the sweet tears are tender with her eyes.
1119,LAUS VENERIS,
1120,LAUS VENERIS,"Ah, not as they, but as the souls that were"
1121,LAUS VENERIS,"Slain in the old time, having found her fair;"
1122,LAUS VENERIS,"Who, sleeping with her lips upon their eyes,"
1123,LAUS VENERIS,Heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair.
1124,LAUS VENERIS,
1125,LAUS VENERIS,Their blood runs round the roots of time like rain:
1126,LAUS VENERIS,She casts them forth and gathers them again;
1127,LAUS VENERIS,With nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies
1128,LAUS VENERIS,Exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain.
1129,LAUS VENERIS,
1130,LAUS VENERIS,"Her little chambers drip with flower-like red,"
1131,LAUS VENERIS,"Her girdles, and the chaplets of her head,"
1132,LAUS VENERIS,Her armlets and her anklets; with her feet
1133,LAUS VENERIS,She tramples all that winepress of the dead.
1134,LAUS VENERIS,
1135,LAUS VENERIS,"Her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires,"
1136,LAUS VENERIS,With loves burnt out and unassuaged desires;
1137,LAUS VENERIS,"Between her lips the steam of them is sweet,"
1138,LAUS VENERIS,The languor in her ears of many lyres.
1139,LAUS VENERIS,
1140,LAUS VENERIS,"Her beds are full of perfume and sad sound,"
1141,LAUS VENERIS,"Her doors are made with music, and barred round"
1142,LAUS VENERIS,"With sighing and with laughter and with tears,"
1143,LAUS VENERIS,With tears whereby strong souls of men are bound.
1144,LAUS VENERIS,
1145,LAUS VENERIS,There is the knight Adonis that was slain;
1146,LAUS VENERIS,With flesh and blood she chains him for a chain;
1147,LAUS VENERIS,The body and the spirit in her ears
1148,LAUS VENERIS,"Cry, for her lips divide him vein by vein."
1149,LAUS VENERIS,
1150,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, all she slayeth; yea, every man save me;"
1151,LAUS VENERIS,"Me, love, thy lover that must cleave to thee"
1152,LAUS VENERIS,"Till the ending of the days and ways of earth,"
1153,LAUS VENERIS,The shaking of the sources of the sea.
1154,LAUS VENERIS,
1155,LAUS VENERIS,"Me, most forsaken of all souls that fell;"
1156,LAUS VENERIS,"Me, satiated with things insatiable;"
1157,LAUS VENERIS,"Me, for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth,"
1158,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, laughter kindles at the heart of hell."
1159,LAUS VENERIS,
1160,LAUS VENERIS,Alas thy beauty! for thy mouth's sweet sake
1161,LAUS VENERIS,"My soul is bitter to me, my limbs quake"
1162,LAUS VENERIS,"As water, as the flesh of men that weep,"
1163,LAUS VENERIS,As their heart's vein whose heart goes nigh to break.
1164,LAUS VENERIS,
1165,LAUS VENERIS,"Ah God, that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips"
1166,LAUS VENERIS,Would crush the fruit of death upon my lips;
1167,LAUS VENERIS,"Ah God, that death would tread the grapes of sleep"
1168,LAUS VENERIS,And wring their juice upon me as it drips.
1169,LAUS VENERIS,
1170,LAUS VENERIS,"There is no change of cheer for many days,"
1171,LAUS VENERIS,"But change of chimes high up in the air, that sways"
1172,LAUS VENERIS,Rung by the running fingers of the wind;
1173,LAUS VENERIS,And singing sorrows heard on hidden ways.
1174,LAUS VENERIS,
1175,LAUS VENERIS,"Day smiteth day in twain, night sundereth night,"
1176,LAUS VENERIS,And on mine eyes the dark sits as the light;
1177,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, Lord, thou knowest I know not, having sinned,"
1178,LAUS VENERIS,If heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight.
1179,LAUS VENERIS,
1180,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, as if earth were sprinkled over me,"
1181,LAUS VENERIS,"Such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea,"
1182,LAUS VENERIS,"Each pore doth yearn, and the dried blood thereof"
1183,LAUS VENERIS,"Gasps by sick fits, my heart swims heavily,"
1184,LAUS VENERIS,
1185,LAUS VENERIS,There is a feverish famine in my veins;
1186,LAUS VENERIS,"Below her bosom, where a crushed grape stains"
1187,LAUS VENERIS,"The white and blue, there my lips caught and clove"
1188,LAUS VENERIS,"An hour since, and what mark of me remains?"
1189,LAUS VENERIS,
1190,LAUS VENERIS,"I dare not always touch her, lest the kiss"
1191,LAUS VENERIS,"Leave my lips charred. Yea, Lord, a little bliss,"
1192,LAUS VENERIS,"Brief bitter bliss, one hath for a great sin;"
1193,LAUS VENERIS,Nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is.
1194,LAUS VENERIS,
1195,LAUS VENERIS,"Sin, is it sin whereby men's souls are thrust"
1196,LAUS VENERIS,Into the pit? yet had I a good trust
1197,LAUS VENERIS,"To save my soul before it slipped therein,"
1198,LAUS VENERIS,Trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust.
1199,LAUS VENERIS,
1200,LAUS VENERIS,"For if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath,"
1201,LAUS VENERIS,I look between the iron sides of death
1202,LAUS VENERIS,"Into sad hell where all sweet love hath end,"
1203,LAUS VENERIS,All but the pain that never finisheth.
1204,LAUS VENERIS,
1205,LAUS VENERIS,"There are the naked faces of great kings,"
1206,LAUS VENERIS,The singing folk with all their lute-playings;
1207,LAUS VENERIS,There when one cometh he shall have to friend
1208,LAUS VENERIS,The grave that covets and the worm that clings.
1209,LAUS VENERIS,
1210,LAUS VENERIS,"There sit the knights that were so great of hand,"
1211,LAUS VENERIS,"The ladies that were queens of fair green land,"
1212,LAUS VENERIS,"Grown grey and black now, brought unto the dust,"
1213,LAUS VENERIS,"Soiled, without raiment, clad about with sand."
1214,LAUS VENERIS,
1215,LAUS VENERIS,There is one end for all of them; they sit
1216,LAUS VENERIS,"Naked and sad, they drink the dregs of it,"
1217,LAUS VENERIS,Trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust.
1218,LAUS VENERIS,Trampled and trodden by the fiery feet.
1219,LAUS VENERIS,
1220,LAUS VENERIS,I see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell
1221,LAUS VENERIS,"Cities and people whom the gods loved well,"
1222,LAUS VENERIS,"Yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold,"
1223,LAUS VENERIS,And for their sakes on her the fire of hell.
1224,LAUS VENERIS,
1225,LAUS VENERIS,"And softer than the Egyptian lote-leaf is,"
1226,LAUS VENERIS,"The queen whose face was worth the world to kiss,"
1227,LAUS VENERIS,Wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold;
1228,LAUS VENERIS,"And large pale lips of strong Semiramis,"
1229,LAUS VENERIS,
1230,LAUS VENERIS,Curled like a tiger's that curl back to feed;
1231,LAUS VENERIS,Red only where the last kiss made them bleed;
1232,LAUS VENERIS,"Her hair most thick with many a carven gem,"
1233,LAUS VENERIS,"Deep in the mane, great-chested, like a steed."
1234,LAUS VENERIS,
1235,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, with red sin the faces of them shine;"
1236,LAUS VENERIS,But in all these there was no sin like mine;
1237,LAUS VENERIS,"No, not in all the strange great sins of them"
1238,LAUS VENERIS,That made the wine-press froth and foam with wine.
1239,LAUS VENERIS,
1240,LAUS VENERIS,"For I was of Christ's choosing, I God's knight,"
1241,LAUS VENERIS,No blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light;
1242,LAUS VENERIS,"I can well see, for all the dusty days"
1243,LAUS VENERIS,"Gone past, the clean great time of goodly fight."
1244,LAUS VENERIS,
1245,LAUS VENERIS,"I smell the breathing battle sharp with blows,"
1246,LAUS VENERIS,With shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows;
1247,LAUS VENERIS,"The fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways,"
1248,LAUS VENERIS,Sounds and long lights are shed between the rows
1249,LAUS VENERIS,
1250,LAUS VENERIS,"Of beautiful mailed men; the edged light slips,"
1251,LAUS VENERIS,Most like a snake that takes short breath and dips
1252,LAUS VENERIS,"Sharp from the beautifully bending head,"
1253,LAUS VENERIS,With all its gracious body lithe as lips
1254,LAUS VENERIS,
1255,LAUS VENERIS,That curl in touching you; right in this wise
1256,LAUS VENERIS,"My sword doth, seeming fire in mine own eyes,"
1257,LAUS VENERIS,Leaving all colours in them brown and red
1258,LAUS VENERIS,"And flecked with death; then the keen breaths like sighs,"
1259,LAUS VENERIS,
1260,LAUS VENERIS,"The caught-up choked dry laughters following them,"
1261,LAUS VENERIS,When all the fighting face is grown a flame
1262,LAUS VENERIS,"For pleasure, and the pulse that stuns the ears,"
1263,LAUS VENERIS,And the heart's gladness of the goodly game.
1264,LAUS VENERIS,
1265,LAUS VENERIS,Let me think yet a little; I do know
1266,LAUS VENERIS,"These things were sweet, but sweet such years ago,"
1267,LAUS VENERIS,Their savour is all turned now into tears;
1268,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, ten years since, where the blue ripples blow,"
1269,LAUS VENERIS,
1270,LAUS VENERIS,"The blue curled eddies of the blowing Rhine,"
1271,LAUS VENERIS,I felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine
1272,LAUS VENERIS,"Touch my blood too, and sting me with delight"
1273,LAUS VENERIS,Through all this waste and weary body of mine
1274,LAUS VENERIS,
1275,LAUS VENERIS,That never feels clear air; right gladly then
1276,LAUS VENERIS,"I rode alone, a great way off my men,"
1277,LAUS VENERIS,"And heard the chiming bridle smite and smite,"
1278,LAUS VENERIS,"And gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again,"
1279,LAUS VENERIS,
1280,LAUS VENERIS,Till my song shifted to that iron one;
1281,LAUS VENERIS,Seeing there rode up between me and the sun
1282,LAUS VENERIS,"Some certain of my foe's men, for his three"
1283,LAUS VENERIS,White wolves across their painted coats did run.
1284,LAUS VENERIS,
1285,LAUS VENERIS,"The first red-bearded, with square cheeks--alack,"
1286,LAUS VENERIS,I made my knave's blood turn his beard to black;
1287,LAUS VENERIS,The slaying of him was a joy to see:
1288,LAUS VENERIS,"Perchance too, when at night he came not back,"
1289,LAUS VENERIS,
1290,LAUS VENERIS,"Some woman fell a-weeping, whom this thief"
1291,LAUS VENERIS,Would beat when he had drunken; yet small grief
1292,LAUS VENERIS,Hath any for the ridding of such knaves;
1293,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, if one wept, I doubt her teen was brief."
1294,LAUS VENERIS,
1295,LAUS VENERIS,"This bitter love is sorrow in all lands,"
1296,LAUS VENERIS,"Draining of eyelids, wringing of drenched hands,"
1297,LAUS VENERIS,Sighing of hearts and filling up of graves;
1298,LAUS VENERIS,"A sign across the head of the world he stands,"
1299,LAUS VENERIS,
1300,LAUS VENERIS,An one that hath a plague-mark on his brows;
1301,LAUS VENERIS,Dust and spilt blood do track him to his house
1302,LAUS VENERIS,"Down under earth; sweet smells of lip and cheek,"
1303,LAUS VENERIS,Like a sweet snake's breath made more poisonous
1304,LAUS VENERIS,
1305,LAUS VENERIS,"With chewing of some perfumed deadly grass,"
1306,LAUS VENERIS,"Are shed all round his passage if he pass,"
1307,LAUS VENERIS,"And their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak,"
1308,LAUS VENERIS,Sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was.
1309,LAUS VENERIS,
1310,LAUS VENERIS,As one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds
1311,LAUS VENERIS,"Smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds,"
1312,LAUS VENERIS,And tracking ever slotwise the warm smell
1313,LAUS VENERIS,"Is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds,"
1314,LAUS VENERIS,
1315,LAUS VENERIS,His head far down the hot sweet throat of her--
1316,LAUS VENERIS,"So one tracks love, whose breath is deadlier,"
1317,LAUS VENERIS,"And lo, one springe and you are fast in hell,"
1318,LAUS VENERIS,Fast as the gin's grip of a wayfarer.
1319,LAUS VENERIS,
1320,LAUS VENERIS,"I think now, as the heavy hours decease"
1321,LAUS VENERIS,"One after one, and bitter thoughts increase"
1322,LAUS VENERIS,"One upon one, of all sweet finished things;"
1323,LAUS VENERIS,The breaking of the battle; the long peace
1324,LAUS VENERIS,
1325,LAUS VENERIS,"Wherein we sat clothed softly, each man's hair"
1326,LAUS VENERIS,Crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair;
1327,LAUS VENERIS,"The sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings,"
1328,LAUS VENERIS,And noise of singing in the late sweet air.
1329,LAUS VENERIS,
1330,LAUS VENERIS,"I sang of love too, knowing nought thereof;"
1331,LAUS VENERIS,"""Sweeter,"" I said, ""the little laugh of love"
1332,LAUS VENERIS,"Than tears out of the eyes of Magdalen,"
1333,LAUS VENERIS,Or any fallen feather of the Dove.
1334,LAUS VENERIS,
1335,LAUS VENERIS,"""The broken little laugh that spoils a kiss,"
1336,LAUS VENERIS,"The ache of purple pulses, and the bliss"
1337,LAUS VENERIS,Of blinded eyelids that expand again--
1338,LAUS VENERIS,"Love draws them open with those lips of his,"
1339,LAUS VENERIS,
1340,LAUS VENERIS,"""Lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown"
1341,LAUS VENERIS,Of one same fire and colour with their own;
1342,LAUS VENERIS,"Then ere one sleep, appeased with sacrifice,"
1343,LAUS VENERIS,"Where his lips wounded, there his lips atone."""
1344,LAUS VENERIS,
1345,LAUS VENERIS,I sang these things long since and knew them not;
1346,LAUS VENERIS,"""Lo, here is love, or there is love, God wot,"
1347,LAUS VENERIS,"This man and that finds favour in his eyes,"""
1348,LAUS VENERIS,"I said, ""but I, what guerdon have I got?"
1349,LAUS VENERIS,
1350,LAUS VENERIS,"""The dust of praise that is blown everywhere"
1351,LAUS VENERIS,In all men's faces with the common air;
1352,LAUS VENERIS,The bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet
1353,LAUS VENERIS,"Before they wind it in a singer's hair."""
1354,LAUS VENERIS,
1355,LAUS VENERIS,So that one dawn I rode forth sorrowing;
1356,LAUS VENERIS,"I had no hope but of some evil thing,"
1357,LAUS VENERIS,And so rode slowly past the windy wheat
1358,LAUS VENERIS,"And past the vineyard and the water-spring,"
1359,LAUS VENERIS,
1360,LAUS VENERIS,Up to the Horsel. A great elder-tree
1361,LAUS VENERIS,Held back its heaps of flowers to let me see
1362,LAUS VENERIS,"The ripe tall grass, and one that walked therein,"
1363,LAUS VENERIS,"Naked, with hair shed over to the knee."
1364,LAUS VENERIS,
1365,LAUS VENERIS,She walked between the blossom and the grass;
1366,LAUS VENERIS,"I knew the beauty of her, what she was,"
1367,LAUS VENERIS,"The beauty of her body and her sin,"
1368,LAUS VENERIS,"And in my flesh the sin of hers, alas!"
1369,LAUS VENERIS,
1370,LAUS VENERIS,Alas! for sorrow is all the end of this.
1371,LAUS VENERIS,"O sad kissed mouth, how sorrowful it is!"
1372,LAUS VENERIS,"O breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings,"
1373,LAUS VENERIS,Red with the bitter blossom of a kiss!
1374,LAUS VENERIS,
1375,LAUS VENERIS,"Ah, with blind lips I felt for you, and found"
1376,LAUS VENERIS,"About my neck your hands and hair enwound,"
1377,LAUS VENERIS,"The hands that stifle and the hair that stings,"
1378,LAUS VENERIS,I felt them fasten sharply without sound.
1379,LAUS VENERIS,
1380,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, for my sin I had great store of bliss:"
1381,LAUS VENERIS,"Rise up, make answer for me, let thy kiss"
1382,LAUS VENERIS,"Seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin,"
1383,LAUS VENERIS,Lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is.
1384,LAUS VENERIS,
1385,LAUS VENERIS,"Yet I waxed faint with fume of barren bowers,"
1386,LAUS VENERIS,And murmuring of the heavy-headed hours;
1387,LAUS VENERIS,And let the dove's beak fret and peck within
1388,LAUS VENERIS,"My lips in vain, and Love shed fruitless flowers."
1389,LAUS VENERIS,
1390,LAUS VENERIS,So that God looked upon me when your hands
1391,LAUS VENERIS,"Were hot about me; yea, God brake my bands"
1392,LAUS VENERIS,"To save my soul alive, and I came forth"
1393,LAUS VENERIS,Like a man blind and naked in strange lands
1394,LAUS VENERIS,
1395,LAUS VENERIS,"That hears men laugh and weep, and knows not whence"
1396,LAUS VENERIS,"Nor wherefore, but is broken in his sense;"
1397,LAUS VENERIS,Howbeit I met folk riding from the north
1398,LAUS VENERIS,"Towards Rome, to purge them of their souls' offence,"
1399,LAUS VENERIS,
1400,LAUS VENERIS,"And rode with them, and spake to none; the day"
1401,LAUS VENERIS,"Stunned me like lights upon some wizard way,"
1402,LAUS VENERIS,And ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight;
1403,LAUS VENERIS,"So rode I, hearing all these chant and pray,"
1404,LAUS VENERIS,
1405,LAUS VENERIS,And marvelled; till before us rose and fell
1406,LAUS VENERIS,"White cursed hills, like outer skirts of hell"
1407,LAUS VENERIS,"Seen where men's eyes look through the day to night,"
1408,LAUS VENERIS,"Like a jagged shell's lips, harsh, untunable,"
1409,LAUS VENERIS,
1410,LAUS VENERIS,Blown in between by devils' wrangling breath;
1411,LAUS VENERIS,"Nathless we won well past that hell and death,"
1412,LAUS VENERIS,"Down to the sweet land where all airs are good,"
1413,LAUS VENERIS,Even unto Rome where God's grace tarrieth.
1414,LAUS VENERIS,
1415,LAUS VENERIS,Then came each man and worshipped at his knees
1416,LAUS VENERIS,Who in the Lord God's likeness bears the keys
1417,LAUS VENERIS,"To bind or loose, and called on Christ's shed blood,"
1418,LAUS VENERIS,And so the sweet-souled father gave him ease.
1419,LAUS VENERIS,
1420,LAUS VENERIS,"But when I came I fell down at his feet,"
1421,LAUS VENERIS,"Saying, ""Father, though the Lord's blood be right sweet,"
1422,LAUS VENERIS,"The spot it takes not off the panther's skin,"
1423,LAUS VENERIS,Nor shall an Ethiop's stain be bleached with it.
1424,LAUS VENERIS,
1425,LAUS VENERIS,"""Lo, I have sinned and have spat out at God,"
1426,LAUS VENERIS,Wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod
1427,LAUS VENERIS,"More sharp because of mine exceeding sin,"
1428,LAUS VENERIS,And all his raiment redder than bright blood
1429,LAUS VENERIS,
1430,LAUS VENERIS,"""Before mine eyes; yea, for my sake I wot"
1431,LAUS VENERIS,The heat of hell is waxen seven times hot
1432,LAUS VENERIS,"Through my great sin."" Then spake he some sweet word,"
1433,LAUS VENERIS,Giving me cheer; which thing availed me not;
1434,LAUS VENERIS,
1435,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, scarce I wist if such indeed were said;"
1436,LAUS VENERIS,"For when I ceased--lo, as one newly dead"
1437,LAUS VENERIS,"Who hears a great cry out of hell, I heard"
1438,LAUS VENERIS,The crying of his voice across my head.
1439,LAUS VENERIS,
1440,LAUS VENERIS,"""Until this dry shred staff, that hath no whit"
1441,LAUS VENERIS,"Of leaf nor bark, bear blossom and smell sweet,"
1442,LAUS VENERIS,"Seek thou not any mercy in God's sight,"
1443,LAUS VENERIS,"For so long shalt thou be cast out from it."""
1444,LAUS VENERIS,
1445,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, what if dried-up stems wax red and green,"
1446,LAUS VENERIS,Shall that thing be which is not nor has been?
1447,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, what if sapless bark wax green and white,"
1448,LAUS VENERIS,Shall any good fruit grow upon my sin?
1449,LAUS VENERIS,
1450,LAUS VENERIS,"Nay, though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree,"
1451,LAUS VENERIS,"And though men drew sweet waters of the sea,"
1452,LAUS VENERIS,"There should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem,"
1453,LAUS VENERIS,This waste wan body and shaken soul of me.
1454,LAUS VENERIS,
1455,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, though God search it warily enough,"
1456,LAUS VENERIS,There is not one sound thing in all thereof;
1457,LAUS VENERIS,"Though he search all my veins through, searching them"
1458,LAUS VENERIS,He shall find nothing whole therein but love.
1459,LAUS VENERIS,
1460,LAUS VENERIS,"For I came home right heavy, with small cheer,"
1461,LAUS VENERIS,"And lo my love, mine own soul's heart, more dear"
1462,LAUS VENERIS,"Than mine own soul, more beautiful than God,"
1463,LAUS VENERIS,Who hath my being between the hands of her--
1464,LAUS VENERIS,
1465,LAUS VENERIS,"Fair still, but fair for no man saving me,"
1466,LAUS VENERIS,As when she came out of the naked sea
1467,LAUS VENERIS,"Making the foam as fire whereon she trod,"
1468,LAUS VENERIS,And as the inner flower of fire was she.
1469,LAUS VENERIS,
1470,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, she laid hold upon me, and her mouth"
1471,LAUS VENERIS,"Clove unto mine as soul to body doth,"
1472,LAUS VENERIS,"And, laughing, made her lips luxurious;"
1473,LAUS VENERIS,"Her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south,"
1474,LAUS VENERIS,
1475,LAUS VENERIS,"Strange spice and flower, strange savour of crushed fruit,"
1476,LAUS VENERIS,And perfume the swart kings tread underfoot
1477,LAUS VENERIS,"For pleasure when their minds wax amorous,"
1478,LAUS VENERIS,Charred frankincense and grated sandal-root.
1479,LAUS VENERIS,
1480,LAUS VENERIS,"And I forgot fear and all weary things,"
1481,LAUS VENERIS,"All ended prayers and perished thanksgivings,"
1482,LAUS VENERIS,Feeling her face with all her eager hair
1483,LAUS VENERIS,"Cleave to me, clinging as a fire that clings"
1484,LAUS VENERIS,
1485,LAUS VENERIS,"To the body and to the raiment, burning them;"
1486,LAUS VENERIS,As after death I know that such-like flame
1487,LAUS VENERIS,"Shall cleave to me for ever; yea, what care,"
1488,LAUS VENERIS,"Albeit I burn then, having felt the same?"
1489,LAUS VENERIS,
1490,LAUS VENERIS,"Ah love, there is no better life than this;"
1491,LAUS VENERIS,"To have known love, how bitter a thing it is,"
1492,LAUS VENERIS,And afterward be cast out of God's sight;
1493,LAUS VENERIS,"Yea, these that know not, shall they have such bliss"
1494,LAUS VENERIS,
1495,LAUS VENERIS,High up in barren heaven before his face
1496,LAUS VENERIS,"As we twain in the heavy-hearted place,"
1497,LAUS VENERIS,"Remembering love and all the dead delight,"
1498,LAUS VENERIS,And all that time was sweet with for a space?
1499,LAUS VENERIS,
1500,LAUS VENERIS,"For till the thunder in the trumpet be,"
1501,LAUS VENERIS,"Soul may divide from body, but not we"
1502,LAUS VENERIS,"One from another; I hold thee with my hand,"
1503,LAUS VENERIS,"I let mine eyes have all their will of thee,"
1504,LAUS VENERIS,
1505,LAUS VENERIS,"I seal myself upon thee with my might,"
1506,LAUS VENERIS,Abiding alway out of all men's sight
1507,LAUS VENERIS,Until God loosen over sea and land
1508,LAUS VENERIS,The thunder of the trumpets of the night.

1958,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Nor joy nor sorrow, nor life nor death."
1959,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
1960,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I had grown pure as the dawn and the dew,"
1961,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,You had grown strong as the sun or the sea.
1962,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,But none shall triumph a whole life through:
1963,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"For death is one, and the fates are three."
1964,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"At the door of life, by the gate of breath,"
1965,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,There are worse things waiting for men than death;
1966,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Death could not sever my soul and you,"
1967,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,As these have severed your soul from me.
1968,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
1969,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"You have chosen and clung to the chance they sent you,"
1970,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer.
1971,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,But will it not one day in heaven repent you?
1972,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Will they solace you wholly, the days that were?"
1973,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Will you lift up your eyes between sadness and bliss,"
1974,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Meet mine, and see where the great love is,"
1975,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,And tremble and turn and be changed? Content you;
1976,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,The gate is strait; I shall not be there.
1977,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
1978,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"But you, had you chosen, had you stretched hand,"
1979,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Had you seen good such a thing were done,"
1980,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,I too might have stood with the souls that stand
1981,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"In the sun's sight, clothed with the light of the sun;"
1982,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,But who now on earth need care how I live?
1983,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Have the high gods anything left to give,"
1984,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Save dust and laurels and gold and sand?
1985,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Which gifts are goodly; but I will none.
1986,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
1987,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"O all fair lovers about the world,"
1988,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"There is none of you, none, that shall comfort me."
1989,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"My thoughts are as dead things, wrecked and whirled"
1990,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Round and round in a gulf of the sea;
1991,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And still, through the sound and the straining stream,"
1992,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Through the coil and chafe, they gleam in a dream,"
1993,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The bright fine lips so cruelly curled,"
1994,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,And strange swift eyes where the soul sits free.
1995,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
1996,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Free, without pity, withheld from woe,"
1997,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Ignorant; fair as the eyes are fair.
1998,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Would I have you change now, change at a blow,"
1999,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Startled and stricken, awake and aware?"
2000,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Yea, if I could, would I have you see"
2001,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"My very love of you filling me,"
2002,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And know my soul to the quick, as I know"
2003,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,The likeness and look of your throat and hair?
2004,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2005,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I shall not change you. Nay, though I might,"
2006,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Would I change my sweet one love with a word?
2007,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I had rather your hair should change in a night,"
2008,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Clear now as the plume of a black bright bird;
2009,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Your face fail suddenly, cease, turn grey,"
2010,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Die as a leaf that dies in a day.
2011,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I will keep my soul in a place out of sight,"
2012,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Far off, where the pulse of it is not heard."
2013,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2014,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Far off it walks, in a bleak blown space,"
2015,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Full of the sound of the sorrow of years.
2016,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I have woven a veil for the weeping face,"
2017,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Whose lips have drunken the wine of tears;
2018,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I have found a way for the failing feet,"
2019,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,A place for slumber and sorrow to meet;
2020,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"There is no rumour about the place,"
2021,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Nor light, nor any that sees or hears."
2022,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2023,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I have hidden my soul out of sight, and said"
2024,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"""Let none take pity upon thee, none"
2025,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Comfort thy crying: for lo, thou art dead,"
2026,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Lie still now, safe out of sight of the sun."
2027,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Have I not built thee a grave, and wrought"
2028,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Thy grave-clothes on thee of grievous thought,"
2029,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"With soft spun verses and tears unshed,"
2030,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,And sweet light visions of things undone?
2031,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2032,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"""I have given thee garments and balm and myrrh,"
2033,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And gold, and beautiful burial things."
2034,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"But thou, be at peace now, make no stir;"
2035,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Is not thy grave as a royal king's?
2036,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Fret not thyself though the end were sore;
2037,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Sleep, be patient, vex me no more."
2038,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Sleep; what hast thou to do with her?
2039,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The eyes that weep, with the mouth that sings?"""
2040,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2041,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Where the dead red leaves of the years lie rotten,"
2042,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The cold old crimes and the deeds thrown by,"
2043,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The misconceived and the misbegotten,"
2044,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I would find a sin to do ere I die,"
2045,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Sure to dissolve and destroy me all through,"
2046,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"That would set you higher in heaven, serve you"
2047,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And leave you happy, when clean forgotten,"
2048,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"As a dead man out of mind, am I."
2049,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2050,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Your lithe hands draw me, your face burns through me,"
2051,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I am swift to follow you, keen to see;"
2052,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,But love lacks might to redeem or undo me;
2053,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"As I have been, I know I shall surely be;"
2054,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"""What should such fellows as I do?"" Nay,"
2055,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,My part were worse if I chose to play;
2056,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"For the worst is this after all; if they knew me,"
2057,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Not a soul upon earth would pity me.
2058,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2059,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And I play not for pity of these; but you,"
2060,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"If you saw with your soul what man am I,"
2061,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,You would praise me at least that my soul all through
2062,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Clove to you, loathing the lives that lie;"
2063,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The souls and lips that are bought and sold,"
2064,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The smiles of silver and kisses of gold,"
2065,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The lapdog loves that whine as they chew,"
2066,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,The little lovers that curse and cry.
2067,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2068,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"There are fairer women, I hear; that may be;"
2069,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"But I, that I love you and find you fair,"
2070,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Who are more than fair in my eyes if they be,"
2071,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Do the high gods know or the great gods care?
2072,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Though the swords in my heart for one were seven,"
2073,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Would the iron hollow of doubtful heaven,"
2074,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"That knows not itself whether night-time or day be,"
2075,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Reverberate words and a foolish prayer?
2076,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2077,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I will go back to the great sweet mother,"
2078,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Mother and lover of men, the sea."
2079,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I will go down to her, I and none other,"
2080,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Close with her, kiss her and mix her with me;"
2081,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Cling to her, strive with her, hold her fast:"
2082,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"O fair white mother, in days long past"
2083,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Born without sister, born without brother,"
2084,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Set free my soul as thy soul is free.
2085,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2086,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"O fair green-girdled mother of mine,"
2087,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Sea, that art clothed with the sun and the rain,"
2088,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Thy sweet hard kisses are strong like wine,"
2089,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Thy large embraces are keen like pain.
2090,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Save me and hide me with all thy waves,"
2091,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Find me one grave of thy thousand graves,"
2092,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Those pure cold populous graves of thine
2093,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Wrought without hand in a world without stain.
2094,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2095,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I shall sleep, and move with the moving ships,"
2096,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Change as the winds change, veer in the tide;"
2097,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"My lips will feast on the foam of thy lips,"
2098,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I shall rise with thy rising, with thee subside;"
2099,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Sleep, and not know if she be, if she were,"
2100,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Filled full with life to the eyes and hair,"
2101,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,As a rose is fulfilled to the roseleaf tips
2102,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,With splendid summer and perfume and pride.
2103,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2104,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"This woven raiment of nights and days,"
2105,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Were it once cast off and unwound from me,"
2106,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Naked and glad would I walk in thy ways,"
2107,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Alive and aware of thy ways and thee;
2108,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Clear of the whole world, hidden at home,"
2109,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Clothed with the green and crowned with the foam,"
2110,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"A pulse of the life of thy straits and bays,"
2111,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,A vein in the heart of the streams of the sea.
2112,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2113,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Fair mother, fed with the lives of men,"
2114,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Thou art subtle and cruel of heart, men say."
2115,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Thou hast taken, and shalt not render again;"
2116,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Thou art full of thy dead, and cold as they."
2117,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,But death is the worst that comes of thee;
2118,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Thou art fed with our dead, O mother, O sea,"
2119,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"But when hast thou fed on our hearts? or when,"
2120,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Having given us love, hast thou taken away?"
2121,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2122,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"O tender-hearted, O perfect lover,"
2123,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Thy lips are bitter, and sweet thine heart."
2124,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The hopes that hurt and the dreams that hover,"
2125,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Shall they not vanish away and apart?
2126,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"But thou, thou art sure, thou art older than earth;"
2127,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Thou art strong for death and fruitful of birth;
2128,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Thy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover;
2129,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,From the first thou wert; in the end thou art.
2130,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2131,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And grief shall endure not for ever, I know."
2132,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,As things that are not shall these things be;
2133,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"We shall live through seasons of sun and of snow,"
2134,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,And none be grievous as this to me.
2135,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"We shall hear, as one in a trance that hears,"
2136,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The sound of time, the rhyme of the years;"
2137,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Wrecked hope and passionate pain will grow
2138,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,As tender things of a spring-tide sea.
2139,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2140,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Sea-fruit that swings in the waves that hiss,"
2141,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Drowned gold and purple and royal rings.
2142,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And all time past, was it all for this?"
2143,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Times unforgotten, and treasures of things?"
2144,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Swift years of liking and sweet long laughter,"
2145,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,That wist not well of the years thereafter
2146,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Till love woke, smitten at heart by a kiss,"
2147,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,With lips that trembled and trailing wings?
2148,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2149,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,There lived a singer in France of old
2150,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,By the tideless dolorous midland sea.
2151,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,In a land of sand and ruin and gold
2152,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"There shone one woman, and none but she."
2153,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And finding life for her love's sake fail,"
2154,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Being fain to see her, he bade set sail,"
2155,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Touched land, and saw her as life grew cold,"
2156,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And praised God, seeing; and so died he."
2157,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2158,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Died, praising God for his gift and grace:"
2159,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"For she bowed down to him weeping, and said"
2160,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"""Live;"" and her tears were shed on his face"
2161,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Or ever the life in his face was shed.
2162,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The sharp tears fell through her hair, and stung"
2163,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Once, and her close lips touched him and clung"
2164,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Once, and grew one with his lips for a space;"
2165,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"And so drew back, and the man was dead."
2166,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2167,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"O brother, the gods were good to you."
2168,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Sleep, and be glad while the world endures."
2169,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Be well content as the years wear through;
2170,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Give thanks for life, and the loves and lures;"
2171,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Give thanks for life, O brother, and death,"
2172,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"For the sweet last sound of her feet, her breath,"
2173,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"For gifts she gave you, gracious and few,"
2174,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Tears and kisses, that lady of yours."
2175,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2176,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Rest, and be glad of the gods; but I,"
2177,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"How shall I praise them, or how take rest?"
2178,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,There is not room under all the sky
2179,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"For me that know not of worst or best,"
2180,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Dream or desire of the days before,"
2181,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Sweet things or bitterness, any more."
2182,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Love will not come to me now though I die,"
2183,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"As love came close to you, breast to breast."
2184,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2185,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,I shall never be friends again with roses;
2186,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I shall loathe sweet tunes, where a note grown strong"
2187,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Relents and recoils, and climbs and closes,"
2188,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,As a wave of the sea turned back by song.
2189,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"There are sounds where the soul's delight takes fire,"
2190,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Face to face with its own desire;
2191,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"A delight that rebels, a desire that reposes;"
2192,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,I shall hate sweet music my whole life long.
2193,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2194,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The pulse of war and passion of wonder,"
2195,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The heavens that murmur, the sounds that shine,"
2196,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The stars that sing and the loves that thunder,"
2197,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The music burning at heart like wine,"
2198,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,An armed archangel whose hands raise up
2199,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,All senses mixed in the spirit's cup
2200,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Till flesh and spirit are molten in sunder--
2201,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"These things are over, and no more mine."
2202,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2203,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,These were a part of the playing I heard
2204,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Once, ere my love and my heart were at strife;"
2205,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Love that sings and hath wings as a bird,"
2206,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Balm of the wound and heft of the knife.
2207,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Fairer than earth is the sea, and sleep"
2208,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Than overwatching of eyes that weep,"
2209,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Now time has done with his one sweet word,"
2210,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,The wine and leaven of lovely life.
2211,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2212,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I shall go my ways, tread out my measure,"
2213,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,Fill the days of my daily breath
2214,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"With fugitive things not good to treasure,"
2215,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Do as the world doth, say as it saith;"
2216,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"But if we had loved each other--O sweet,"
2217,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Had you felt, lying under the palms of your feet,"
2218,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The heart of my heart, beating harder with pleasure"
2219,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,To feel you tread it to dust and death--
2220,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,
2221,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Ah, had I not taken my life up and given"
2222,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"All that life gives and the years let go,"
2223,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"The wine and honey, the balm and leaven,"
2224,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,The dreams reared high and the hopes brought low?
2225,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Come life, come death, not a word be said;"
2226,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"Should I lose you living, and vex you dead?"
2227,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"I never shall tell you on earth; and in heaven,"
2228,THE TRIUMPH OF TIME,"If I cry to you then, will you hear or know?"

2245,LES NOYADES,

2249,LES NOYADES,"Maidens and young men, naked and wed."
2250,LES NOYADES,
2251,LES NOYADES,They brought on a day to his judgment-place
2252,LES NOYADES,"One rough with labour and red with fight,"
2253,LES NOYADES,"And a lady noble by name and face,"

2256,LES NOYADES,"She knew not, being for shame's sake blind,"
2257,LES NOYADES,If his eyes were hot on her face hard by.
2258,LES NOYADES,"And the judge bade strip and ship them, and bind"
2259,LES NOYADES,"Bosom to bosom, to drown and die."
2260,LES NOYADES,
2261,LES NOYADES,The white girl winced and whitened; but he
2262,LES NOYADES,"Caught fire, waxed bright as a great bright flame"
2263,LES NOYADES,"Seen with thunder far out on the sea,"
2264,LES NOYADES,Laughed hard as the glad blood went and came.
2265,LES NOYADES,

2267,LES NOYADES,"""I have but a word to you all, one word;"

2269,LES NOYADES,And all they laughed and mocked him and heard.
2270,LES NOYADES,
2271,LES NOYADES,"""Judge, when they open the judgment-roll,"

2475,SAPPHO.,
2476,SAPPHO.,My life is bitter with thy love; thine eyes
2477,SAPPHO.,"Blind me, thy tresses burn me, thy sharp sighs"
2478,SAPPHO.,"Divide my flesh and spirit with soft sound,"
2479,SAPPHO.,"And my blood strengthens, and my veins abound."
2480,SAPPHO.,"I pray thee sigh not, speak not, draw not breath;"
2481,SAPPHO.,"Let life burn down, and dream it is not death."
2482,SAPPHO.,"I would the sea had hidden us, the fire"
2483,SAPPHO.,"(Wilt thou fear that, and fear not my desire?)"
2484,SAPPHO.,"Severed the bones that bleach, the flesh that cleaves,"
2485,SAPPHO.,And let our sifted ashes drop like leaves.
2486,SAPPHO.,I feel thy blood against my blood: my pain
2487,SAPPHO.,"Pains thee, and lips bruise lips, and vein stings vein."
2488,SAPPHO.,"Let fruit be crushed on fruit, let flower on flower,"
2489,SAPPHO.,"Breast kindle breast, and either burn one hour."
2490,SAPPHO.,Why wilt thou follow lesser loves? are thine
2491,SAPPHO.,Too weak to bear these hands and lips of mine?
2492,SAPPHO.,"I charge thee for my life's sake, O too sweet"
2493,SAPPHO.,"To crush love with thy cruel faultless feet,"
2494,SAPPHO.,"I charge thee keep thy lips from hers or his,"
2495,SAPPHO.,"Sweetest, till theirs be sweeter than my kiss."
2496,SAPPHO.,"Lest I too lure, a swallow for a dove,"
2497,SAPPHO.,Erotion or Erinna to my love.
2498,SAPPHO.,I would my love could kill thee; I am satiated
2499,SAPPHO.,"With seeing thee live, and fain would have thee dead."
2500,SAPPHO.,"I would earth had thy body as fruit to eat,"
2501,SAPPHO.,And no mouth but some serpent's found thee sweet.
2502,SAPPHO.,"I would find grievous ways to have thee slain,"
2503,SAPPHO.,"Intense device, and superflux of pain;"
2504,SAPPHO.,"Vex thee with amorous agonies, and shake"
2505,SAPPHO.,"Life at thy lips, and leave it there to ache;"
2506,SAPPHO.,"Strain out thy soul with pangs too soft to kill,"
2507,SAPPHO.,"Intolerable interludes, and infinite ill;"
2508,SAPPHO.,"Relapse and reluctation of the breath,"
2509,SAPPHO.,Dumb tunes and shuddering semitones of death.
2510,SAPPHO.,"I am weary of all thy words and soft strange ways,"
2511,SAPPHO.,"Of all love's fiery nights and all his days,"
2512,SAPPHO.,And all the broken kisses salt as brine
2513,SAPPHO.,"That shuddering lips make moist with waterish wine,"
2514,SAPPHO.,And eyes the bluer for all those hidden hours
2515,SAPPHO.,"That pleasure fills with tears and feeds from flowers,"
2516,SAPPHO.,"Fierce at the heart with fire that half comes through,"
2517,SAPPHO.,But all the flowerlike white stained round with blue;
2518,SAPPHO.,"The fervent underlid, and that above"
2519,SAPPHO.,Lifted with laughter or abashed with love;
2520,SAPPHO.,"Thine amorous girdle, full of thee and fair,"
2521,SAPPHO.,And leavings of the lilies in thine hair.
2522,SAPPHO.,"Yea, all sweet words of thine and all thy ways,"
2523,SAPPHO.,"And all the fruit of nights and flower of days,"
2524,SAPPHO.,And stinging lips wherein the hot sweet brine
2525,SAPPHO.,"That Love was born of burns and foams like wine,"
2526,SAPPHO.,"And eyes insatiable of amorous hours,"
2527,SAPPHO.,"Fervent as fire and delicate as flowers,"
2528,SAPPHO.,"Coloured like night at heart, but cloven through"
2529,SAPPHO.,"Like night with flame, dyed round like night with blue,"
2530,SAPPHO.,Clothed with deep eyelids under and above--
2531,SAPPHO.,"Yea, all thy beauty sickens me with love;"
2532,SAPPHO.,"Thy girdle empty of thee and now not fair,"
2533,SAPPHO.,And ruinous lilies in thy languid hair.
2534,SAPPHO.,"Ah, take no thought for Love's sake; shall this be,"
2535,SAPPHO.,And she who loves thy lover not love thee?
2536,SAPPHO.,"Sweet soul, sweet mouth of all that laughs and lives,"
2537,SAPPHO.,"Mine is she, very mine; and she forgives."
2538,SAPPHO.,For I beheld in sleep the light that is
2539,SAPPHO.,"In her high place in Paphos, heard the kiss"
2540,SAPPHO.,Of body and soul that mix with eager tears
2541,SAPPHO.,And laughter stinging through the eyes and ears;
2542,SAPPHO.,"Saw Love, as burning flame from crown to feet,"
2543,SAPPHO.,"Imperishable, upon her storied seat;"
2544,SAPPHO.,"Clear eyelids lifted toward the north and south,"
2545,SAPPHO.,"A mind of many colours, and a mouth"
2546,SAPPHO.,"Of many tunes and kisses; and she bowed,"
2547,SAPPHO.,"With all her subtle face laughing aloud,"
2548,SAPPHO.,"Bowed down upon me, saying, ""Who doth thee wrong,"
2549,SAPPHO.,"Sappho?"" but thou--thy body is the song,"
2550,SAPPHO.,"Thy mouth the music; thou art more than I,"
2551,SAPPHO.,Though my voice die not till the whole world die;
2552,SAPPHO.,"Though men that hear it madden; though love weep,"
2553,SAPPHO.,"Though nature change, though shame be charmed to sleep."
2554,SAPPHO.,"Ah, wilt thou slay me lest I kiss thee dead?"
2555,SAPPHO.,Yet the queen laughed from her sweet heart and said:
2556,SAPPHO.,"""Even she that flies shall follow for thy sake,"
2557,SAPPHO.,"And she shall give thee gifts that would not take,"
2558,SAPPHO.,"Shall kiss that would not kiss thee"" (yea, kiss me)"
2559,SAPPHO.,"""When thou wouldst not""--when I would not kiss thee!"
2560,SAPPHO.,"Ah, more to me than all men as thou art,"
2561,SAPPHO.,Shall not my songs assuage her at the heart?
2562,SAPPHO.,"Ah, sweet to me as life seems sweet to death,"
2563,SAPPHO.,Why should her wrath fill thee with fearful breath?
2564,SAPPHO.,"Nay, sweet, for is she God alone? hath she"
2565,SAPPHO.,"Made earth and all the centuries of the sea,"
2566,SAPPHO.,"Taught the sun ways to travel, woven most fine"
2567,SAPPHO.,"The moonbeams, shed the starbeams forth as wine,"
2568,SAPPHO.,"Bound with her myrtles, beaten with her rods,"
2569,SAPPHO.,The young men and the maidens and the gods?
2570,SAPPHO.,"Have we not lips to love with, eyes for tears,"
2571,SAPPHO.,And summer and flower of women and of years?
2572,SAPPHO.,"Stars for the foot of morning, and for noon"
2573,SAPPHO.,"Sunlight, and exaltation of the moon;"
2574,SAPPHO.,"Waters that answer waters, fields that wear"
2575,SAPPHO.,"Lilies, and languor of the Lesbian air?"
2576,SAPPHO.,"Beyond those flying feet of fluttered doves,"
2577,SAPPHO.,Are there not other gods for other loves?
2578,SAPPHO.,"Yea, though she scourge thee, sweetest, for my sake,"
2579,SAPPHO.,Blossom not thorns and flowers not blood should break.
2580,SAPPHO.,"Ah that my lips were tuneless lips, but pressed"
2581,SAPPHO.,To the bruised blossom of thy scourged white breast!
2582,SAPPHO.,Ah that my mouth for Muses' milk were fed
2583,SAPPHO.,On the sweet blood thy sweet small wounds had bled!
2584,SAPPHO.,"That with my tongue I felt them, and could taste"
2585,SAPPHO.,The faint flakes from thy bosom to the waist!
2586,SAPPHO.,"That I could drink thy veins as wine, and eat"
2587,SAPPHO.,Thy breasts like honey! that from face to feet
2588,SAPPHO.,"Thy body were abolished and consumed,"
2589,SAPPHO.,And in my flesh thy very flesh entombed!
2590,SAPPHO.,"Ah, ah, thy beauty! like a beast it bites,"
2591,SAPPHO.,"Stings like an adder, like an arrow smites."
2592,SAPPHO.,"Ah sweet, and sweet again, and seven times sweet,"
2593,SAPPHO.,The paces and the pauses of thy feet!
2594,SAPPHO.,Ah sweeter than all sleep or summer air
2595,SAPPHO.,The fallen fillets fragrant from thine hair!
2596,SAPPHO.,"Yea, though their alien kisses do me wrong,"
2597,SAPPHO.,Sweeter thy lips than mine with all their song;
2598,SAPPHO.,"Thy shoulders whiter than a fleece of white,"
2599,SAPPHO.,"And flower-sweet fingers, good to bruise or bite"
2600,SAPPHO.,"As honeycomb of the inmost honey-cells,"
2601,SAPPHO.,With almond-shaped and roseleaf-coloured shells
2602,SAPPHO.,And blood like purple blossom at the tips
2603,SAPPHO.,Quivering; and pain made perfect in thy lips
2604,SAPPHO.,For my sake when I hurt thee; O that I
2605,SAPPHO.,"Durst crush thee out of life with love, and die,"
2606,SAPPHO.,"Die of thy pain and my delight, and be"
2607,SAPPHO.,Mixed with thy blood and molten into thee!
2608,SAPPHO.,Would I not plague thee dying overmuch?
2609,SAPPHO.,Would I not hurt thee perfectly? not touch
2610,SAPPHO.,"Thy pores of sense with torture, and make bright"
2611,SAPPHO.,Thine eyes with bloodlike tears and grievous light?
2612,SAPPHO.,"Strike pang from pang as note is struck from note,"
2613,SAPPHO.,"Catch the sob's middle music in thy throat,"
2614,SAPPHO.,"Take thy limbs living, and new-mould with these"
2615,SAPPHO.,A lyre of many faultless agonies?
2616,SAPPHO.,"Feed thee with fever and famine and fine drouth,"
2617,SAPPHO.,"With perfect pangs convulse thy perfect mouth,"
2618,SAPPHO.,"Make thy life shudder in thee and burn afresh,"
2619,SAPPHO.,And wring thy very spirit through the flesh?
2620,SAPPHO.,Cruel? but love makes all that love him well
2621,SAPPHO.,As wise as heaven and crueller than hell.
2622,SAPPHO.,Me hath love made more bitter toward thee
2623,SAPPHO.,Than death toward man; but were I made as he
2624,SAPPHO.,"Who hath made all things to break them one by one,"
2625,SAPPHO.,If my feet trod upon the stars and sun
2626,SAPPHO.,"And souls of men as his have alway trod,"
2627,SAPPHO.,God knows I might be crueller than God.
2628,SAPPHO.,For who shall change with prayers or thanksgivings
2629,SAPPHO.,The mystery of the cruelty of things?
2630,SAPPHO.,Or say what God above all gods and years
2631,SAPPHO.,"With offering and blood-sacrifice of tears,"
2632,SAPPHO.,"With lamentation from strange lands, from graves"
2633,SAPPHO.,"Where the snake pastures, from scarred mouths of slaves,"
2634,SAPPHO.,"From prison, and from plunging prows of ships"
2635,SAPPHO.,Through flamelike foam of the sea's closing lips--
2636,SAPPHO.,"With thwartings of strange signs, and wind-blown hair"
2637,SAPPHO.,"Of comets, desolating the dim air,"
2638,SAPPHO.,"When darkness is made fast with seals and bars,"
2639,SAPPHO.,"And fierce reluctance of disastrous stars,"
2640,SAPPHO.,"Eclipse, and sound of shaken hills, and wings"
2641,SAPPHO.,"Darkening, and blind inexpiable things--"
2642,SAPPHO.,"With sorrow of labouring moons, and altering light"
2643,SAPPHO.,"And travail of the planets of the night,"
2644,SAPPHO.,"And weeping of the weary Pleiads seven,"
2645,SAPPHO.,Feeds the mute melancholy lust of heaven?
2646,SAPPHO.,"Is not his incense bitterness, his meat"
2647,SAPPHO.,Murder? his hidden face and iron feet
2648,SAPPHO.,"Hath not man known, and felt them on their way"
2649,SAPPHO.,Threaten and trample all things and every day?
2650,SAPPHO.,Hath he not sent us hunger? who hath cursed
2651,SAPPHO.,Spirit and flesh with longing? filled with thirst
2652,SAPPHO.,Their lips who cried unto him? who bade exceed
2653,SAPPHO.,"The fervid will, fall short the feeble deed,"
2654,SAPPHO.,"Bade sink the spirit and the flesh aspire,"
2655,SAPPHO.,"Pain animate the dust of dead desire,"
2656,SAPPHO.,And life yield up her flower to violent fate?
2657,SAPPHO.,"Him would I reach, him smite, him desecrate,"
2658,SAPPHO.,"Pierce the cold lips of God with human breath,"
2659,SAPPHO.,And mix his immortality with death.
2660,SAPPHO.,Why hath he made us? what had all we done
2661,SAPPHO.,"That we should live and loathe the sterile sun,"
2662,SAPPHO.,"And with the moon wax paler as she wanes,"
2663,SAPPHO.,And pulse by pulse feel time grow through our veins?
2664,SAPPHO.,Thee too the years shall cover; thou shalt be
2665,SAPPHO.,"As the rose born of one same blood with thee,"
2666,SAPPHO.,"As a song sung, as a word said, and fall"
2667,SAPPHO.,"Flower-wise, and be not any more at all,"
2668,SAPPHO.,Nor any memory of thee anywhere;
2669,SAPPHO.,For never Muse has bound above thine hair
2670,SAPPHO.,The high Pierian flower whose graft outgrows
2671,SAPPHO.,All summer kinship of the mortal rose
2672,SAPPHO.,"And colour of deciduous days, nor shed"
2673,SAPPHO.,"Reflex and flush of heaven about thine head,"
2674,SAPPHO.,Nor reddened brows made pale by floral grief
2675,SAPPHO.,With splendid shadow from that lordlier leaf.
2676,SAPPHO.,"Yea, thou shalt be forgotten like spilt wine,"
2677,SAPPHO.,Except these kisses of my lips on thine
2678,SAPPHO.,Brand them with immortality; but me--
2679,SAPPHO.,"Men shall not see bright fire nor hear the sea,"
2680,SAPPHO.,"Nor mix their hearts with music, nor behold"
2681,SAPPHO.,"Cast forth of heaven, with feet of awful gold"
2682,SAPPHO.,"And plumeless wings that make the bright air blind,"
2683,SAPPHO.,"Lightning, with thunder for a hound behind"

2687,SAPPHO.,And shudder of water that makes felt on land
2688,SAPPHO.,"The immeasurable tremor of all the sea,"
2689,SAPPHO.,Memories shall mix and metaphors of me.
2690,SAPPHO.,"Like me shall be the shuddering calm of night,"

3568,TENTH ANTIPHONE,And cursing to bride;

3597,I,
3598,I,Who hath known the ways of time
3599,I,Or trodden behind his feet?
3600,I,There is no such man among men.
3601,I,"For chance overcomes him, or crime"
3602,I,Changes; for all things sweet
3603,I,In time wax bitter again.
3604,I,"Who shall give sorrow enough,"
3605,I,Or who the abundance of tears?
3606,I,Mine eyes are heavy with love
3607,I,"And a sword gone thorough mine ears,"
3608,I,"A sound like a sword and fire,"
3609,I,"For pity, for great desire;"
3610,I,"Who shall ensure me thereof,"
3611,I,"Lest I die, being full of my fears?"
3612,I,
3613,I,"Who hath known the ways and the wrath,"
3614,I,"The sleepless spirit, the root"
3615,I,"And blossom of evil will,"
3616,I,The divine device of a god?
3617,I,Who shall behold it or hath?
3618,I,"The twice-tongued prophets are mute,"
3619,I,The many speakers are still;
3620,I,"No foot has travelled or trod,"
3621,I,"No hand has meted, his path."
3622,I,"Man's fate is a blood-red fruit,"
3623,I,And the mighty gods have their fill
3624,I,"And relax not the rein, or the rod."
3625,I,
3626,I,"Ye were mighty in heart from of old,"
3627,I,"Ye slew with the spear, and are slain."
3628,I,"Keen after heat is the cold,"
3629,I,"Sore after summer is rain,"
3630,I,And melteth man to the bone.
3631,I,"As water he weareth away,"
3632,I,"As a flower, as an hour in a day,"
3633,I,Fallen from laughter to moan.
3634,I,But my spirit is shaken with fear
3635,I,"Lest an evil thing begin,"
3636,I,"New-born, a spear for a spear,"
3637,I,And one for another sin.
3638,I,"Or ever our tears began,"
3639,I,It was known from of old and said;
3640,I,"One law for a living man,"
3641,I,And another law for the dead.
3642,I,"For these are fearful and sad,"
3643,I,"Vain, and things without breath;"
3644,I,"While he lives let a man be glad,"
3645,I,For none hath joy of his death.
3646,I,
3647,I,
3648,II,II
3649,II,
3650,II,"Who hath known the pain, the old pain of earth,"
3651,II,"Or all the travail of the sea,"
3652,II,"The many ways and waves, the birth"
3653,II,"Fruitless, the labour nothing worth?"
3654,II,"Who hath known, who knoweth, O gods? not we."
3655,II,"There is none shall say he hath seen,"
3656,II,There is none he hath known.
3657,II,"Though he saith, Lo, a lord have I been,"
3658,II,I have reaped and sown;
3659,II,"I have seen the desire of mine eyes,"
3660,II,"The beginning of love,"
3661,II,The season of kisses and sighs
3662,II,And the end thereof.
3663,II,"I have known the ways of the sea,"
3664,II,"All the perilous ways,"
3665,II,"Strange winds have spoken with me,"
3666,II,And the tongues of strange days.
3667,II,I have hewn the pine for ships;
3668,II,"Where steeds run arow,"
3669,II,I have seen from their bridled lips
3670,II,Foam blown as the snow.
3671,II,With snapping of chariot-poles
3672,II,And with straining of oars
3673,II,"I have grazed in the race the goals,"
3674,II,In the storm the shores;
3675,II,As a greave is cleft with an arrow
3676,II,"At the joint of the knee,"
3677,II,I have cleft through the sea-straits narrow
3678,II,To the heart of the sea.
3679,II,When air was smitten in sunder
3680,II,I have watched on high
3681,II,The ways of the stars and the thunder
3682,II,In the night of the sky;
3683,II,"Where the dark brings forth light as a flower,"
3684,II,As from lips that dissever;
3685,II,"One abideth the space of an hour,"
3686,II,One endureth for ever.
3687,II,"Lo, what hath he seen or known,"
3688,II,Of the way and the wave
3689,II,"Unbeholden, unsailed on, unsown,"
3690,II,From the breast to the grave?
3691,II,
3692,II,"Or ever the stars were made, or skies,"
3693,II,"Grief was born, and the kinless night,"
3694,II,Mother of gods without form or name.
3695,II,"And light is born out of heaven and dies,"
3696,II,"And one day knows not another's light,"
3697,II,"But night is one, and her shape the same."
3698,II,
3699,II,But dumb the goddesses underground
3700,II,"Wait, and we hear not on earth if their feet"
3701,II,"Rise, and the night wax loud with their wings;"
3702,II,"Dumb, without word or shadow of sound;"
3703,II,And sift in scales and winnow as wheat
3704,II,"Men's souls, and sorrow of manifold things."
3705,II,
3706,II,
3707,III,III
3708,III,
3709,III,Nor less of grief than ours
3710,III,The gods wrought long ago
3711,III,To bruise men one by one;
3712,III,But with the incessant hours
3713,III,Fresh grief and greener woe
3714,III,"Spring, as the sudden sun"
3715,III,Year after year makes flowers;
3716,III,"And these die down and grow,"
3717,III,And the next year lacks none.
3718,III,
3719,III,"As these men sleep, have slept"
3720,III,"The old heroes in time fled,"
3721,III,No dream-divided sleep;
3722,III,And holier eyes have wept
3723,III,"Than ours, when on her dead"
3724,III,"Gods have seen Thetis weep,"
3725,III,With heavenly hair far-swept
3726,III,"Back, heavenly hands outspread"
3727,III,"Round what she could not keep,"
3728,III,
3729,III,"Could not one day withhold,"
3730,III,One night; and like as these
3731,III,"White ashes of no weight,"
3732,III,Held not his urn the cold
3733,III,Ashes of Heracles?
3734,III,For all things born one gate
3735,III,"Opens, no gate of gold;"
3736,III,Opens; and no man sees
3737,III,Beyond the gods and fate.

3936,FAUSTINE,
3937,FAUSTINE,"The shapely silver shoulder stoops,"
3938,FAUSTINE,Weighed over clean

3941,FAUSTINE,
3942,FAUSTINE,Let me go over your good gifts
3943,FAUSTINE,That crown you queen;
3944,FAUSTINE,A queen whose kingdom ebbs and shifts
3945,FAUSTINE,"Each week, Faustine."
3946,FAUSTINE,
3947,FAUSTINE,Bright heavy brows well gathered up:
3948,FAUSTINE,White gloss and sheen;
3949,FAUSTINE,Carved lips that make my lips a cup
3950,FAUSTINE,"To drink, Faustine,"
3951,FAUSTINE,
3952,FAUSTINE,"Wine and rank poison, milk and blood,"
3953,FAUSTINE,Being mixed therein
3954,FAUSTINE,Since first the devil threw dice with God
3955,FAUSTINE,"For you, Faustine."
3956,FAUSTINE,
3957,FAUSTINE,"Your naked new-born soul, their stake,"
3958,FAUSTINE,Stood blind between;
3959,FAUSTINE,"God said ""let him that wins her take"

4000,FAUSTINE,"Our sins, Faustine?"
4001,FAUSTINE,
4002,FAUSTINE,"I know what queen at first you were,"
4003,FAUSTINE,As though I had seen
4004,FAUSTINE,Red gold and black imperious hair
4005,FAUSTINE,Twice crown Faustine.

4010,FAUSTINE,The same Faustine.
4011,FAUSTINE,
4012,FAUSTINE,"She loved the games men played with death,"
4013,FAUSTINE,Where death must win;

4015,FAUSTINE,Revived Faustine.
4016,FAUSTINE,
4017,FAUSTINE,"Nets caught the pike, pikes tore the net;"
4018,FAUSTINE,Lithe limbs and lean
4019,FAUSTINE,From drained-out pores dripped thick red sweat
4020,FAUSTINE,To soothe Faustine.
4021,FAUSTINE,
4022,FAUSTINE,She drank the steaming drift and dust
4023,FAUSTINE,Blown off the scene;
4024,FAUSTINE,Blood could not ease the bitter lust
4025,FAUSTINE,That galled Faustine.
4026,FAUSTINE,
4027,FAUSTINE,"All round the foul fat furrows reeked,"
4028,FAUSTINE,Where blood sank in;
4029,FAUSTINE,The circus splashed and seethed and shrieked
4030,FAUSTINE,All round Faustine.
4031,FAUSTINE,
4032,FAUSTINE,But these are gone now: years entomb
4033,FAUSTINE,The dust and din;
4034,FAUSTINE,"Yea, even the bath's fierce reek and fume"
4035,FAUSTINE,That slew Faustine.
4036,FAUSTINE,
4037,FAUSTINE,Was life worth living then? and now
4038,FAUSTINE,Is life worth sin?
4039,FAUSTINE,Where are the imperial years? and how
4040,FAUSTINE,Are you Faustine?
4041,FAUSTINE,
4042,FAUSTINE,"Your soul forgot her joys, forgot"
4043,FAUSTINE,Her times of teen;
4044,FAUSTINE,"Yea, this life likewise will you not"
4045,FAUSTINE,"Forget, Faustine?"
4046,FAUSTINE,
4047,FAUSTINE,For in the time we know not of
4048,FAUSTINE,Did fate begin
4049,FAUSTINE,Weaving the web of days that wove
4050,FAUSTINE,"Your doom, Faustine."
4051,FAUSTINE,
4052,FAUSTINE,"The threads were wet with wine, and all"
4053,FAUSTINE,Were smooth to spin;
4054,FAUSTINE,"They wove you like a Bacchanal,"
4055,FAUSTINE,The first Faustine.
4056,FAUSTINE,
4057,FAUSTINE,And Bacchus cast your mates and you
4058,FAUSTINE,Wild grapes to glean;
4059,FAUSTINE,Your flower-like lips were dashed with dew
4060,FAUSTINE,"From his, Faustine."
4061,FAUSTINE,
4062,FAUSTINE,Your drenched loose hands were stretched to hold
4063,FAUSTINE,"The vine's wet green,"
4064,FAUSTINE,Long ere they coined in Roman gold
4065,FAUSTINE,"Your face, Faustine."
4066,FAUSTINE,
4067,FAUSTINE,Then after change of soaring feather
4068,FAUSTINE,"And winnowing fin,"
4069,FAUSTINE,"You woke in weeks of feverish weather,"
4070,FAUSTINE,A new Faustine.
4071,FAUSTINE,
4072,FAUSTINE,"A star upon your birthday burned,"
4073,FAUSTINE,Whose fierce serene
4074,FAUSTINE,Red pulseless planet never yearned
4075,FAUSTINE,"In heaven, Faustine."
4076,FAUSTINE,
4077,FAUSTINE,Stray breaths of Sapphic song that blew
4078,FAUSTINE,Through Mitylene
4079,FAUSTINE,Shook the fierce quivering blood in you
4080,FAUSTINE,"By night, Faustine."
4081,FAUSTINE,
4082,FAUSTINE,The shameless nameless love that makes
4083,FAUSTINE,Hell's iron gin
4084,FAUSTINE,Shut on you like a trap that breaks
4085,FAUSTINE,"The soul, Faustine."
4086,FAUSTINE,
4087,FAUSTINE,"And when your veins were void and dead,"
4088,FAUSTINE,What ghosts unclean
4089,FAUSTINE,Swarmed round the straitened barren bed
4090,FAUSTINE,That hid Faustine?
4091,FAUSTINE,
4092,FAUSTINE,What sterile growths of sexless root
4093,FAUSTINE,Or epicene?
4094,FAUSTINE,What flower of kisses without fruit
4095,FAUSTINE,"Of love, Faustine?"
4096,FAUSTINE,
4097,FAUSTINE,What adders came to shed their coats?
4098,FAUSTINE,What coiled obscene
4099,FAUSTINE,Small serpents with soft stretching throats
4100,FAUSTINE,Caressed Faustine?
4101,FAUSTINE,
4102,FAUSTINE,"But the time came of famished hours,"
4103,FAUSTINE,"Maimed loves and mean,"
4104,FAUSTINE,"This ghastly thin-faced time of ours,"
4105,FAUSTINE,To spoil Faustine.
4106,FAUSTINE,
4107,FAUSTINE,"You seem a thing that hinges hold,"
4108,FAUSTINE,A love-machine
4109,FAUSTINE,With clockwork joints of supple gold--
4110,FAUSTINE,"No more, Faustine."
4111,FAUSTINE,
4112,FAUSTINE,"Not godless, for you serve one God,"
4113,FAUSTINE,"The Lampsacene,"
4114,FAUSTINE,Who metes the gardens with his rod;
4115,FAUSTINE,"Your lord, Faustine."
4116,FAUSTINE,
4117,FAUSTINE,If one should love you with real love
4118,FAUSTINE,"(Such things have been,"
4119,FAUSTINE,"Things your fair face knows nothing of,"
4120,FAUSTINE,"It seems, Faustine);"
4121,FAUSTINE,
4122,FAUSTINE,"That clear hair heavily bound back,"
4123,FAUSTINE,The lights wherein
4124,FAUSTINE,Shift from dead blue to burnt-up black;
4125,FAUSTINE,"Your throat, Faustine,"
4126,FAUSTINE,
4127,FAUSTINE,"Strong, heavy, throwing out the face"
4128,FAUSTINE,And hard bright chin
4129,FAUSTINE,And shameful scornful lips that grace
4130,FAUSTINE,"Their shame, Faustine,"
4131,FAUSTINE,
4132,FAUSTINE,"Curled lips, long-since half kissed away,"
4133,FAUSTINE,Still sweet and keen;
4134,FAUSTINE,You'd give him--poison shall we say?

4315,THE LEPER,
4316,THE LEPER,
4317,THE LEPER,"Nothing is better, I well think,"
4318,THE LEPER,Than love; the hidden well-water
4319,THE LEPER,Is not so delicate to drink:
4320,THE LEPER,This was well seen of me and her.
4321,THE LEPER,
4322,THE LEPER,I served her in a royal house;
4323,THE LEPER,I served her wine and curious meat.
4324,THE LEPER,"For will to kiss between her brows,"
4325,THE LEPER,I had no heart to sleep or eat.
4326,THE LEPER,
4327,THE LEPER,"Mere scorn God knows she had of me,"
4328,THE LEPER,"A poor scribe, nowise great or fair,"
4329,THE LEPER,Who plucked his clerk's hood back to see
4330,THE LEPER,Her curled-up lips and amorous hair.
4331,THE LEPER,
4332,THE LEPER,I vex my head with thinking this.
4333,THE LEPER,"Yea, though God always hated me,"
4334,THE LEPER,And hates me now that I can kiss
4335,THE LEPER,"Her eyes, plait up her hair to see"
4336,THE LEPER,
4337,THE LEPER,"How she then wore it on the brows,"
4338,THE LEPER,Yet am I glad to have her dead
4339,THE LEPER,Here in this wretched wattled house
4340,THE LEPER,Where I can kiss her eyes and head.
4341,THE LEPER,
4342,THE LEPER,"Nothing is better, I well know,"
4343,THE LEPER,Than love; no amber in cold sea
4344,THE LEPER,Or gathered berries under snow:
4345,THE LEPER,That is well seen of her and me.
4346,THE LEPER,
4347,THE LEPER,Three thoughts I make my pleasure of:
4348,THE LEPER,First I take heart and think of this:
4349,THE LEPER,"That knight's gold hair she chose to love,"
4350,THE LEPER,His mouth she had such will to kiss.
4351,THE LEPER,
4352,THE LEPER,Then I remember that sundawn
4353,THE LEPER,I brought him by a privy way
4354,THE LEPER,"Out at her lattice, and thereon"
4355,THE LEPER,What gracious words she found to say.
4356,THE LEPER,
4357,THE LEPER,(Cold rushes for such little feet--
4358,THE LEPER,Both feet could lie into my hand.
4359,THE LEPER,A marvel was it of my sweet
4360,THE LEPER,Her upright body could so stand.)
4361,THE LEPER,
4362,THE LEPER,"""Sweet friend, God give you thank and grace;"
4363,THE LEPER,"Now am I clean and whole of shame,"
4364,THE LEPER,Nor shall men burn me in the face
4365,THE LEPER,"For my sweet fault that scandals them."""
4366,THE LEPER,
4367,THE LEPER,I tell you over word by word.
4368,THE LEPER,"She, sitting edgewise on her bed,"
4369,THE LEPER,"Holding her feet, said thus. The third,"
4370,THE LEPER,"A sweeter thing than these, I said."
4371,THE LEPER,
4372,THE LEPER,"God, that makes time and ruins it"
4373,THE LEPER,"And alters not, abiding God,"
4374,THE LEPER,"Changed with disease her body sweet,"
4375,THE LEPER,The body of love wherein she abode.
4376,THE LEPER,
4377,THE LEPER,Love is more sweet and comelier
4378,THE LEPER,Than a dove's throat strained out to sing.
4379,THE LEPER,All they spat out and cursed at her
4380,THE LEPER,And cast her forth for a base thing.
4381,THE LEPER,
4382,THE LEPER,"They cursed her, seeing how God had wrought"
4383,THE LEPER,"This curse to plague her, a curse of his."
4384,THE LEPER,"Fools were they surely, seeing not"
4385,THE LEPER,How sweeter than all sweet she is.
4386,THE LEPER,
4387,THE LEPER,"He that had held her by the hair,"
4388,THE LEPER,"With kissing lips blinding her eyes,"
4389,THE LEPER,"Felt her bright bosom, strained and bare,"
4390,THE LEPER,"Sigh under him, with short mad cries"
4391,THE LEPER,
4392,THE LEPER,Out of her throat and sobbing mouth
4393,THE LEPER,"And body broken up with love,"
4394,THE LEPER,With sweet hot tears his lips were loth
4395,THE LEPER,"Her own should taste the savour of,"
4396,THE LEPER,
4397,THE LEPER,"Yea, he inside whose grasp all night"
4398,THE LEPER,"Her fervent body leapt or lay,"
4399,THE LEPER,"Stained with sharp kisses red and white,"
4400,THE LEPER,Found her a plague to spurn away.
4401,THE LEPER,
4402,THE LEPER,"I hid her in this wattled house,"
4403,THE LEPER,I served her water and poor bread.
4404,THE LEPER,For joy to kiss between her brows
4405,THE LEPER,Time upon time I was nigh dead.
4406,THE LEPER,
4407,THE LEPER,Bread failed; we got but well-water
4408,THE LEPER,And gathered grass with dropping seed.
4409,THE LEPER,"I had such joy of kissing her,"
4410,THE LEPER,I had small care to sleep or feed.
4411,THE LEPER,
4412,THE LEPER,Sometimes when service made me glad
4413,THE LEPER,"The sharp tears leapt between my lids,"
4414,THE LEPER,"Falling on her, such joy I had"
4415,THE LEPER,To do the service God forbids.
4416,THE LEPER,
4417,THE LEPER,"""I pray you let me be at peace,"
4418,THE LEPER,"Get hence, make room for me to die."""
4419,THE LEPER,"She said that: her poor lip would cease,"
4420,THE LEPER,"Put up to mine, and turn to cry."
4421,THE LEPER,
4422,THE LEPER,"I said, ""Bethink yourself how love"
4423,THE LEPER,"Fared in us twain, what either did;"
4424,THE LEPER,Shall I unclothe my soul thereof?
4425,THE LEPER,"That I should do this, God forbid."""
4426,THE LEPER,
4427,THE LEPER,"Yea, though God hateth us, he knows"
4428,THE LEPER,That hardly in a little thing
4429,THE LEPER,Love faileth of the work it does
4430,THE LEPER,Till it grow ripe for gathering.
4431,THE LEPER,
4432,THE LEPER,"Six months, and now my sweet is dead"
4433,THE LEPER,A trouble takes me; I know not
4434,THE LEPER,"If all were done well, all well said,"
4435,THE LEPER,No word or tender deed forgot.
4436,THE LEPER,
4437,THE LEPER,"Too sweet, for the least part in her,"
4438,THE LEPER,"To have shed life out by fragments; yet,"
4439,THE LEPER,"Could the close mouth catch breath and stir,"
4440,THE LEPER,I might see something I forget.
4441,THE LEPER,
4442,THE LEPER,"Six months, and I sit still and hold"
4443,THE LEPER,In two cold palms her cold two feet.
4444,THE LEPER,"Her hair, half grey half ruined gold,"
4445,THE LEPER,Thrills me and burns me in kissing it.
4446,THE LEPER,
4447,THE LEPER,"Love bites and stings me through, to see"
4448,THE LEPER,Her keen face made of sunken bones.
4449,THE LEPER,"Her worn-off eyelids madden me,"
4450,THE LEPER,That were shot through with purple once.
4451,THE LEPER,
4452,THE LEPER,"She said, ""Be good with me; I grow"
4453,THE LEPER,"So tired for shame's sake, I shall die"
4454,THE LEPER,"If you say nothing:"" even so."
4455,THE LEPER,"And she is dead now, and shame put by."
4456,THE LEPER,
4457,THE LEPER,"Yea, and the scorn she had of me"
4458,THE LEPER,"In the old time, doubtless vexed her then."
4459,THE LEPER,I never should have kissed her. See
4460,THE LEPER,What fools God's anger makes of men!
4461,THE LEPER,
4462,THE LEPER,"She might have loved me a little too,"
4463,THE LEPER,Had I been humbler for her sake.
4464,THE LEPER,But that new shame could make love new
4465,THE LEPER,She saw not--yet her shame did make.
4466,THE LEPER,
4467,THE LEPER,"I took too much upon my love,"
4468,THE LEPER,Having for such mean service done
4469,THE LEPER,"Her beauty and all the ways thereof,"
4470,THE LEPER,Her face and all the sweet thereon.
4471,THE LEPER,
4472,THE LEPER,"Yea, all this while I tended her,"
4473,THE LEPER,I know the old love held fast his part:
4474,THE LEPER,"I know the old scorn waxed heavier,"
4475,THE LEPER,"Mixed with sad wonder, in her heart."
4476,THE LEPER,
4477,THE LEPER,It may be all my love went wrong--
4478,THE LEPER,"A scribe's work writ awry and blurred,"
4479,THE LEPER,Scrawled after the blind evensong--
4480,THE LEPER,Spoilt music with no perfect word.
4481,THE LEPER,
4482,THE LEPER,But surely I would fain have done
4483,THE LEPER,All things the best I could. Perchance
4484,THE LEPER,"Because I failed, came short of one,"
4485,THE LEPER,She kept at heart that other man's.
4486,THE LEPER,
4487,THE LEPER,I am grown blind with all these things:
4488,THE LEPER,It may be now she hath in sight
4489,THE LEPER,Some better knowledge; still there clings
4490,THE LEPER,The old question. Will not God do right?[3]

5040,TO VICTOR HUGO,And watched with jealous brow
5041,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Lay the blind lightnings shut between God's hands,"
5042,TO VICTOR HUGO,And only loosed on slaves and kings
5043,TO VICTOR HUGO,The terror of the tempest of their wings.
5044,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5045,TO VICTOR HUGO,Born in those younger years
5046,TO VICTOR HUGO,That shone with storms of spears
5047,TO VICTOR HUGO,"And shook in the wind blown from a dead world's pyre,"
5048,TO VICTOR HUGO,When by her back-blown hair
5049,TO VICTOR HUGO,Napoleon caught the fair
5050,TO VICTOR HUGO,"And fierce Republic with her feet of fire,"
5051,TO VICTOR HUGO,And stayed with iron words and hands
5052,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Her flight, and freedom in a thousand lands:"
5053,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5054,TO VICTOR HUGO,Thou sawest the tides of things
5055,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Close over heads of kings,"
5056,TO VICTOR HUGO,"And thine hand felt the thunder, and to thee"
5057,TO VICTOR HUGO,Laurels and lightnings were
5058,TO VICTOR HUGO,As sunbeams and soft air
5059,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Mixed each in other, or as mist with sea"
5060,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Mixed, or as memory with desire,"
5061,TO VICTOR HUGO,Or the lute's pulses with the louder lyre.
5062,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5063,TO VICTOR HUGO,For thee man's spirit stood
5064,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Disrobed of flesh and blood,"
5065,TO VICTOR HUGO,And bare the heart of the most secret hours;
5066,TO VICTOR HUGO,And to thine hand more tame
5067,TO VICTOR HUGO,Than birds in winter came
5068,TO VICTOR HUGO,"High hopes and unknown flying forms of powers,"
5069,TO VICTOR HUGO,"And from thy table fed, and sang"
5070,TO VICTOR HUGO,Till with the tune men's ears took fire and rang.
5071,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5072,TO VICTOR HUGO,Even all men's eyes and ears
5073,TO VICTOR HUGO,With fiery sound and tears
5074,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Waxed hot, and cheeks caught flame and eyelid light,"
5075,TO VICTOR HUGO,At those high songs of thine
5076,TO VICTOR HUGO,"That stung the sense like wine,"
5077,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Or fell more soft than dew or snow by night,"
5078,TO VICTOR HUGO,Or wailed as in some flooded cave
5079,TO VICTOR HUGO,Sobs the strong broken spirit of a wave.
5080,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5081,TO VICTOR HUGO,"But we, our master, we"
5082,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Whose hearts, uplift to thee,"
5083,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Ache with the pulse of thy remembered song,"
5084,TO VICTOR HUGO,We ask not nor await
5085,TO VICTOR HUGO,"From the clenched hands of fate,"
5086,TO VICTOR HUGO,"As thou, remission of the world's old wrong;"
5087,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Respite we ask not, nor release;"
5088,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Freedom a man may have, he shall not peace."
5089,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5090,TO VICTOR HUGO,Though thy most fiery hope
5091,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Storm heaven, to set wide ope"
5092,TO VICTOR HUGO,The all-sought-for gate whence God or Chance debars
5093,TO VICTOR HUGO,"All feet of men, all eyes--"
5094,TO VICTOR HUGO,"The old night resumes her skies,"
5095,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Her hollow hiding-place of clouds and stars,"
5096,TO VICTOR HUGO,Where nought save these is sure in sight;
5097,TO VICTOR HUGO,"And, paven with death, our days are roofed with night."
5098,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5099,TO VICTOR HUGO,One thing we can; to be
5100,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Awhile, as men may, free;"
5101,TO VICTOR HUGO,But not by hope or pleasure the most stern
5102,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Goddess, most awful-eyed,"
5103,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Sits, but on either side"
5104,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Sit sorrow and the wrath of hearts that burn,"
5105,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Sad faith that cannot hope or fear,"
5106,TO VICTOR HUGO,And memory grey with many a flowerless year.
5107,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5108,TO VICTOR HUGO,Not that in stranger's wise
5109,TO VICTOR HUGO,I lift not loving eyes
5110,TO VICTOR HUGO,"To the fair foster-mother France, that gave"
5111,TO VICTOR HUGO,Beyond the pale fleet foam
5112,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Help to my sires and home,"
5113,TO VICTOR HUGO,Whose great sweet breast could shelter those and save
5114,TO VICTOR HUGO,Whom from her nursing breasts and hands
5115,TO VICTOR HUGO,Their land cast forth of old on gentler lands.
5116,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5117,TO VICTOR HUGO,Not without thoughts that ache
5118,TO VICTOR HUGO,"For theirs and for thy sake,"
5119,TO VICTOR HUGO,"I, born of exiles, hail thy banished head;"
5120,TO VICTOR HUGO,I whose young song took flight
5121,TO VICTOR HUGO,Toward the great heat and light
5122,TO VICTOR HUGO,"On me a child from thy far splendour shed,"
5123,TO VICTOR HUGO,"From thine high place of soul and song,"
5124,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Which, fallen on eyes yet feeble, made them strong."
5125,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5126,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Ah, not with lessening love"
5127,TO VICTOR HUGO,"For memories born hereof,"
5128,TO VICTOR HUGO,"I look to that sweet mother-land, and see"
5129,TO VICTOR HUGO,"The old fields and fair full streams,"
5130,TO VICTOR HUGO,"And skies, but fled like dreams"
5131,TO VICTOR HUGO,The feet of freedom and the thought of thee;
5132,TO VICTOR HUGO,And all between the skies and graves
5133,TO VICTOR HUGO,The mirth of mockers and the shame of slaves.
5134,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5135,TO VICTOR HUGO,"She, killed with noisome air,"
5136,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Even she! and still so fair,"
5137,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Who said ""Let there be freedom,"" and there was"
5138,TO VICTOR HUGO,Freedom; and as a lance
5139,TO VICTOR HUGO,The fiery eyes of France
5140,TO VICTOR HUGO,Touched the world's sleep and as a sleep made pass
5141,TO VICTOR HUGO,Forth of men's heavier ears and eyes
5142,TO VICTOR HUGO,Smitten with fire and thunder from new skies.
5143,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5144,TO VICTOR HUGO,Are they men's friends indeed
5145,TO VICTOR HUGO,Who watch them weep and bleed?
5146,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Because thou hast loved us, shall the gods love thee?"
5147,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Thou, first of men and friend,"
5148,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Seest thou, even thou, the end?"
5149,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Thou knowest what hath been, knowest thou what shall be?"
5150,TO VICTOR HUGO,Evils may pass and hopes endure;
5151,TO VICTOR HUGO,"But fate is dim, and all the gods obscure."
5152,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5153,TO VICTOR HUGO,"O nursed in airs apart,"
5154,TO VICTOR HUGO,"O poet highest of heart,"
5155,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Hast thou seen time, who hast seen so many things?"
5156,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Are not the years more wise,"
5157,TO VICTOR HUGO,"More sad than keenest eyes,"
5158,TO VICTOR HUGO,The years with soundless feet and sounding wings?
5159,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Passing we hear them not, but past"
5160,TO VICTOR HUGO,"The clamour of them thrills us, and their blast."
5161,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5162,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Thou art chief of us, and lord;"
5163,TO VICTOR HUGO,Thy song is as a sword
5164,TO VICTOR HUGO,Keen-edged and scented in the blade from flowers;
5165,TO VICTOR HUGO,Thou art lord and king; but we
5166,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Lift younger eyes, and see"
5167,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Less of high hope, less light on wandering hours;"
5168,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Hours that have borne men down so long,"
5169,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Seen the right fail, and watched uplift the wrong."
5170,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5171,TO VICTOR HUGO,"But thine imperial soul,"
5172,TO VICTOR HUGO,As years and ruins roll
5173,TO VICTOR HUGO,"To the same end, and all things and all dreams"
5174,TO VICTOR HUGO,With the same wreck and roar
5175,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Drift on the dim same shore,"
5176,TO VICTOR HUGO,Still in the bitter foam and brackish streams
5177,TO VICTOR HUGO,Tracks the fresh water-spring to be
5178,TO VICTOR HUGO,And sudden sweeter fountains in the sea.
5179,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5180,TO VICTOR HUGO,As once the high God bound
5181,TO VICTOR HUGO,With many a rivet round
5182,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Man's saviour, and with iron nailed him through,"
5183,TO VICTOR HUGO,"At the wild end of things,"
5184,TO VICTOR HUGO,Where even his own bird's wings
5185,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Flagged, whence the sea shone like a drop of dew,"
5186,TO VICTOR HUGO,From Caucasus beheld below
5187,TO VICTOR HUGO,Past fathoms of unfathomable snow;
5188,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5189,TO VICTOR HUGO,"So the strong God, the chance"
5190,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Central of circumstance,"
5191,TO VICTOR HUGO,Still shows him exile who will not be slave;
5192,TO VICTOR HUGO,All thy great fame and thee
5193,TO VICTOR HUGO,Girt by the dim strait sea
5194,TO VICTOR HUGO,With multitudinous walls of wandering wave;
5195,TO VICTOR HUGO,Shows us our greatest from his throne
5196,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Fate-stricken, and rejected of his own."
5197,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5198,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Yea, he is strong, thou say'st,"
5199,TO VICTOR HUGO,"A mystery many-faced,"
5200,TO VICTOR HUGO,The wild beasts know him and the wild birds flee;
5201,TO VICTOR HUGO,"The blind night sees him, death"
5202,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Shrinks beaten at his breath,"
5203,TO VICTOR HUGO,And his right hand is heavy on the sea:
5204,TO VICTOR HUGO,"We know he hath made us, and is king;"
5205,TO VICTOR HUGO,We know not if he care for anything.
5206,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5207,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Thus much, no more, we know;"
5208,TO VICTOR HUGO,"He bade what is be so,"
5209,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Bade light be and bade night be, one by one;"
5210,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Bade hope and fear, bade ill"
5211,TO VICTOR HUGO,"And good redeem and kill,"
5212,TO VICTOR HUGO,Till all men be aweary of the sun
5213,TO VICTOR HUGO,And his world burn in its own flame
5214,TO VICTOR HUGO,And bear no witness longer of his name.
5215,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5216,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Yet though all this be thus,"
5217,TO VICTOR HUGO,Be those men praised of us
5218,TO VICTOR HUGO,Who have loved and wrought and sorrowed and not sinned
5219,TO VICTOR HUGO,"For fame or fear or gold,"
5220,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Nor waxed for winter cold,"
5221,TO VICTOR HUGO,Nor changed for changes of the worldly wind;
5222,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Praised above men of men be these,"
5223,TO VICTOR HUGO,Till this one world and work we know shall cease.
5224,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5225,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Yea, one thing more than this,"
5226,TO VICTOR HUGO,"We know that one thing is,"
5227,TO VICTOR HUGO,"The splendour of a spirit without blame,"
5228,TO VICTOR HUGO,That not the labouring years
5229,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Blind-born, nor any fears,"
5230,TO VICTOR HUGO,Nor men nor any gods can tire or tame;
5231,TO VICTOR HUGO,But purer power with fiery breath
5232,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Fills, and exalts above the gulfs of death."
5233,TO VICTOR HUGO,
5234,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Praised above men be thou,"
5235,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Whose laurel-laden brow,"
5236,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Made for the morning, droops not in the night;"
5237,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Praised and beloved, that none"
5238,TO VICTOR HUGO,Of all thy great things done
5239,TO VICTOR HUGO,Flies higher than thy most equal spirit's flight;
5240,TO VICTOR HUGO,"Praised, that nor doubt nor hope could bend"

5427,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5428,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"There are sins it may be to discover,"
5429,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),There are deeds it may be to delight.
5430,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"What new work wilt thou find for thy lover,"
5431,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),What new passions for daytime or night?
5432,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),What spells that they know not a word of
5433,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Whose lives are as leaves overblown?
5434,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"What tortures undreamt of, unheard of,"
5435,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Unwritten, unknown?"
5436,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5437,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Ah beautiful passionate body
5438,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),That never has ached with a heart!
5439,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"On thy mouth though the kisses are bloody,"
5440,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Though they sting till it shudder and smart,"
5441,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"More kind than the love we adore is,"
5442,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"They hurt not the heart or the brain,"
5443,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"O bitter and tender Dolores,"
5444,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5445,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5446,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"As our kisses relax and redouble,"
5447,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),From the lips and the foam and the fangs
5448,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Shall no new sin be born for men's trouble,"
5449,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),No dream of impossible pangs?
5450,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),With the sweet of the sins of old ages
5451,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Wilt thou satiate thy soul as of yore?
5452,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Too sweet is the rind, say the sages,"
5453,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Too bitter the core.
5454,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5455,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Hast thou told all thy secrets the last time,"
5456,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And bared all thy beauties to one?
5457,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Ah, where shall we go then for pastime,"
5458,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),If the worst that can be has been done?
5459,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),But sweet as the rind was the core is;
5460,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"We are fain of thee still, we are fain,"
5461,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"O sanguine and subtle Dolores,"
5462,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5463,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5464,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"By the hunger of change and emotion,"
5465,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"By the thirst of unbearable things,"
5466,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"By despair, the twin-born of devotion,"
5467,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"By the pleasure that winces and stings,"
5468,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"The delight that consumes the desire,"
5469,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"The desire that outruns the delight,"
5470,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),By the cruelty deaf as a fire
5471,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And blind as the night,"
5472,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5473,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),By the ravenous teeth that have smitten
5474,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Through the kisses that blossom and bud,"
5475,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),By the lips intertwisted and bitten
5476,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Till the foam has a savour of blood,"
5477,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"By the pulse as it rises and falters,"
5478,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"By the hands as they slacken and strain,"
5479,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"I adjure thee, respond from thine altars,"
5480,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5481,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5482,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Wilt thou smile as a woman disdaining
5483,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The light fire in the veins of a boy?
5484,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"But he comes to thee sad, without feigning,"
5485,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Who has wearied of sorrow and joy;
5486,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Less careful of labour and glory
5487,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Than the elders whose hair has uncurled;
5488,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And young, but with fancies as hoary"
5489,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And grey as the world.
5490,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5491,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),I have passed from the outermost portal
5492,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),To the shrine where a sin is a prayer;
5493,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),What care though the service be mortal?
5494,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"O our Lady of Torture, what care?"
5495,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"All thine the last wine that I pour is,"
5496,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"The last in the chalice we drain,"
5497,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"O fierce and luxurious Dolores,"
5498,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5499,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5500,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"All thine the new wine of desire,"
5501,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The fruit of four lips as they clung
5502,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Till the hair and the eyelids took fire,"
5503,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"The foam of a serpentine tongue,"
5504,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"The froth of the serpents of pleasure,"
5505,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"More salt than the foam of the sea,"
5506,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Now felt as a flame, now at leisure"
5507,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),As wine shed for me.
5508,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5509,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Ah thy people, thy children, thy chosen,"
5510,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Marked cross from the womb and perverse!
5511,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),They have found out the secret to cozen
5512,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The gods that constrain us and curse;
5513,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"They alone, they are wise, and none other;"
5514,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Give me place, even me, in their train,"
5515,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"O my sister, my spouse, and my mother,"
5516,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5517,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5518,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),For the crown of our life as it closes
5519,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Is darkness, the fruit thereof dust;"
5520,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"No thorns go as deep as a rose's,"
5521,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And love is more cruel than lust.
5522,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Time turns the old days to derision,"
5523,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our loves into corpses or wives;
5524,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And marriage and death and division
5525,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Make barren our lives.
5526,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5527,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And pale from the past we draw nigh thee,"
5528,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And satiate with comfortless hours;
5529,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And we know thee, how all men belie thee,"
5530,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And we gather the fruit of thy flowers;
5531,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"The passion that slays and recovers,"
5532,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The pangs and the kisses that rain
5533,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"On the lips and the limbs of thy lovers,"
5534,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5535,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5536,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The desire of thy furious embraces
5537,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Is more than the wisdom of years,"
5538,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"On the blossom though blood lie in traces,"
5539,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Though the foliage be sodden with tears.
5540,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),For the lords in whose keeping the door is
5541,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),That opens on all who draw breath
5542,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Gave the cypress to love, my Dolores,"
5543,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The myrtle to death.
5544,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5545,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And they laughed, changing hands in the measure,"
5546,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And they mixed and made peace after strife;
5547,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Pain melted in tears, and was pleasure;"
5548,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Death tingled with blood, and was life."
5549,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Like lovers they melted and tingled,"
5550,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),In the dusk of thine innermost fane;
5551,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"In the darkness they murmured and mingled,"
5552,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5553,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5554,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"In a twilight where virtues are vices,"
5555,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"In thy chapels, unknown of the sun,"
5556,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"To a tune that enthralls and entices,"
5557,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"They were wed, and the twain were as one."
5558,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),For the tune from thine altar hath sounded
5559,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Since God bade the world's work begin,"
5560,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And the fume of thine incense abounded,"
5561,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),To sweeten the sin.
5562,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5563,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Love listens, and paler than ashes,"
5564,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Through his curls as the crown on them slips,"
5565,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Lifts languid wet eyelids and lashes,"
5566,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And laughs with insatiable lips.
5567,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Thou shalt hush him with heavy caresses,"
5568,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),With music that scares the profane;
5569,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Thou shalt darken his eyes with thy tresses,"
5570,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5571,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5572,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Thou shalt blind his bright eyes though he wrestle,"
5573,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Thou shalt chain his light limbs though he strive;
5574,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"In his lips all thy serpents shall nestle,"
5575,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),In his hands all thy cruelties thrive.
5576,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"In the daytime thy voice shall go through him,"
5577,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),In his dreams he shall feel thee and ache;
5578,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Thou shalt kindle by night and subdue him
5579,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Asleep and awake.
5580,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5581,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Thou shalt touch and make redder his roses
5582,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),With juice not of fruit nor of bud;
5583,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"When the sense in the spirit reposes,"
5584,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Thou shalt quicken the soul through the blood.
5585,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Thine, thine the one grace we implore is,"
5586,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Who would live and not languish or feign,"
5587,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"O sleepless and deadly Dolores,"
5588,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5589,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5590,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Dost thou dream, in a respite of slumber,"
5591,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"In a lull of the fires of thy life,"
5592,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Of the days without name, without number,"
5593,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),When thy will stung the world into strife;
5594,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"When, a goddess, the pulse of thy passion"
5595,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Smote kings as they revelled in Rome;
5596,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And they hailed thee re-risen, O Thalassian,"
5597,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Foam-white, from the foam?"
5598,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5599,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),When thy lips had such lovers to flatter;
5600,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"When the city lay red from thy rods,"
5601,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And thine hands were as arrows to scatter
5602,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The children of change and their gods;
5603,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),When the blood of thy foemen made fervent
5604,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"A sand never moist from the main,"
5605,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"As one smote them, their lord and thy servant,"
5606,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5607,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5608,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"On sands by the storm never shaken,"
5609,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Nor wet from the washing of tides;
5610,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Nor by foam of the waves overtaken,"
5611,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Nor winds that the thunder bestrides;
5612,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"But red from the print of thy paces,"
5613,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Made smooth for the world and its lords,"
5614,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Ringed round with a flame of fair faces,"
5615,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And splendid with swords.
5616,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5617,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"There the gladiator, pale for thy pleasure,"
5618,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Drew bitter and perilous breath;
5619,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),There torments laid hold on the treasure
5620,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Of limbs too delicious for death;
5621,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),When thy gardens were lit with live torches;
5622,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),When the world was a steed for thy rein;
5623,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"When the nations lay prone in thy porches,"
5624,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5625,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5626,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"When, with flame all around him aspirant,"
5627,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Stood flushed, as a harp-player stands,"
5628,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"The implacable beautiful tyrant,"
5629,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Rose-crowned, having death in his hands;"
5630,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And a sound as the sound of loud water
5631,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Smote far through the flight of the fires,"
5632,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And mixed with the lightning of slaughter
5633,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),A thunder of lyres.
5634,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5635,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Dost thou dream of what was and no more is,"
5636,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The old kingdoms of earth and the kings?
5637,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Dost thou hunger for these things, Dolores,"
5638,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"For these, in a world of new things?"
5639,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"But thy bosom no fasts could emaciate,"
5640,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),No hunger compel to complain
5641,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Those lips that no bloodshed could satiate,"
5642,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5643,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5644,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"As of old when the world's heart was lighter,"
5645,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Through thy garments the grace of thee glows,"
5646,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The white wealth of thy body made whiter
5647,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"By the blushes of amorous blows,"
5648,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And seamed with sharp lips and fierce fingers,"
5649,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And branded by kisses that bruise;
5650,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"When all shall be gone that now lingers,"
5651,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Ah, what shall we lose?"
5652,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5653,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Thou wert fair in the fearless old fashion,"
5654,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And thy limbs are as melodies yet,"
5655,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And move to the music of passion
5656,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),With lithe and lascivious regret.
5657,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"What ailed us, O gods, to desert you"
5658,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),For creeds that refuse and restrain?
5659,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Come down and redeem us from virtue,"
5660,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5661,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5662,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"All shrines that were Vestal are flameless,"
5663,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),But the flame has not fallen from this;
5664,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Though obscure be the god, and though nameless"
5665,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),The eyes and the hair that we kiss;
5666,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Low fires that love sits by and forges
5667,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Fresh heads for his arrows and thine;
5668,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Hair loosened and soiled in mid orgies
5669,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),With kisses and wine.
5670,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5671,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Thy skin changes country and colour,"
5672,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And shrivels or swells to a snake's.
5673,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Let it brighten and bloat and grow duller,"
5674,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"We know it, the flames and the flakes,"
5675,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Red brands on it smitten and bitten,"
5676,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Round skies where a star is a stain,"
5677,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And the leaves with thy litanies written,"
5678,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5679,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5680,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"On thy bosom though many a kiss be,"
5681,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),There are none such as knew it of old.
5682,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Was it Alciphron once or Arisbe,"
5683,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Male ringlets or feminine gold,"
5684,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"That thy lips met with under the statue,"
5685,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Whence a look shot out sharp after thieves
5686,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),From the eyes of the garden-god at you
5687,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Across the fig-leaves?
5688,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5689,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Then still, through dry seasons and moister,"
5690,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),One god had a wreath to his shrine;
5691,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Then love was the pearl of his oyster,[4]"
5692,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And Venus rose red out of wine.
5693,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"We have all done amiss, choosing rather"
5694,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Such loves as the wise gods disdain;
5695,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Intercede for us thou with thy father,"
5696,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Our Lady of Pain.
5697,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5698,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"In spring he had crowns of his garden,"
5699,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Red corn in the heat of the year,"
5700,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Then hoary green olives that harden
5701,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),When the grape-blossom freezes with fear;
5702,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And milk-budded myrtles with Venus
5703,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And vine-leaves with Bacchus he trod;
5704,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And ye said, ""We have seen, he hath seen us,"
5705,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"A visible God."""
5706,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5707,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),What broke off the garlands that girt you?
5708,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),What sundered you spirit and clay?
5709,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Weak sins yet alive are as virtue
5710,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),To the strength of the sins of that day.
5711,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"For dried is the blood of thy lover,"
5712,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Ipsithilla, contracted the vein;"
5713,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Cry aloud, ""Will he rise and recover,"
5714,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Our Lady of Pain?"""
5715,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5716,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),Cry aloud; for the old world is broken:
5717,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Cry out; for the Phrygian is priest,"
5718,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And rears not the bountiful token
5719,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And spreads not the fatherly feast.
5720,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"From the midmost of Ida, from shady"
5721,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Recesses that murmur at morn,"
5722,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"They have brought and baptized her, Our Lady,"
5723,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),A goddess new-born.
5724,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),
5725,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"And the chaplets of old are above us,"
5726,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And the oyster-bed teems out of reach;
5727,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Old poets outsing and outlove us,"
5728,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),And Catullus makes mouths at our speech.
5729,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"Who shall kiss, in thy father's own city,"
5730,(NOTRE-DAME DES SEPT DOULEURS),"With such lips as he sang with, again?"

6062,HESPERIA,With the thirst and the hunger of lust though her beautiful lips be so
6063,HESPERIA,"bitter,"
6064,HESPERIA,With the cold foul foam of the snakes they soften and redden and
6065,HESPERIA,smile;
6066,HESPERIA,"And her fierce mouth sweetens, her eyes wax wide and her eyelashes"
6067,HESPERIA,"glitter,"
6068,HESPERIA,"And she laughs with a savour of blood in her face, and a savour of"
6069,HESPERIA,guile.
6070,HESPERIA,"She laughs, and her hands reach hither, her hair blows hither and"
6071,HESPERIA,"hisses,"
6072,HESPERIA,"As a low-lit flame in a wind, back-blown till it shudder and leap;"
6073,HESPERIA,"Let her lips not again lay hold on my soul, nor her poisonous kisses,"

6091,HESPERIA,"peril,"

6093,HESPERIA,And the sound of them trampling the way cleaves night as an arrow
6094,HESPERIA,"asunder,"
6095,HESPERIA,And slow by the sand-hill and swift by the down with its glimpses of
6096,HESPERIA,"grass,"
6097,HESPERIA,"Sudden and steady the music, as eight hoofs trample and thunder,"
6098,HESPERIA,Rings in the ear of the low blind wind of the night as we pass;
6099,HESPERIA,Shrill shrieks in our faces the blind bland air that was mute as a

6243,BEFORE PARTING,"Is pleasant; but one tires of scented time,"
6244,BEFORE PARTING,"Cold sweet recurrence of accepted rhyme,"
6245,BEFORE PARTING,And that strong purple under juice and foam
6246,BEFORE PARTING,Where the wine's heart has burst;
6247,BEFORE PARTING,Nor feel the latter kisses like the first.
6248,BEFORE PARTING,
6249,BEFORE PARTING,"Once yet, this poor one time; I will not pray"
6250,BEFORE PARTING,"Even to change the bitterness of it,"
6251,BEFORE PARTING,"The bitter taste ensuing on the sweet,"
6252,BEFORE PARTING,To make your tears fall where your soft hair lay
6253,BEFORE PARTING,All blurred and heavy in some perfumed wise
6254,BEFORE PARTING,Over my face and eyes.
6255,BEFORE PARTING,
6256,BEFORE PARTING,And yet who knows what end the scythèd wheat
6257,BEFORE PARTING,Makes of its foolish poppies' mouths of red?
6258,BEFORE PARTING,"These were not sown, these are not harvested,"
6259,BEFORE PARTING,They grow a month and are cast under feet
6260,BEFORE PARTING,"And none has care thereof,"
6261,BEFORE PARTING,As none has care of a divided love.
6262,BEFORE PARTING,
6263,BEFORE PARTING,"I know each shadow of your lips by rote,"
6264,BEFORE PARTING,Each change of love in eyelids and eyebrows;
6265,BEFORE PARTING,The fashion of fair temples tremulous
6266,BEFORE PARTING,"With tender blood, and colour of your throat;"
6267,BEFORE PARTING,"I know not how love is gone out of this,"
6268,BEFORE PARTING,Seeing that all was his.
6269,BEFORE PARTING,
6270,BEFORE PARTING,Love's likeness there endures upon all these:
6271,BEFORE PARTING,But out of these one shall not gather love.
6272,BEFORE PARTING,Day hath not strength nor the night shade enough
6273,BEFORE PARTING,"To make love whole and fill his lips with ease,"
6274,BEFORE PARTING,As some bee-builded cell
6275,BEFORE PARTING,Feels at filled lips the heavy honey swell.
6276,BEFORE PARTING,
6277,BEFORE PARTING,I know not how this last month leaves your hair
6278,BEFORE PARTING,"Less full of purple colour and hid spice,"
6279,BEFORE PARTING,And that luxurious trouble of closed eyes
6280,BEFORE PARTING,Is mixed with meaner shadow and waste care;
6281,BEFORE PARTING,"And love, kissed out by pleasure, seems not yet"
6282,BEFORE PARTING,Worth patience to regret.

6300,THE SUNDEW,That it lives out the long June heat.
6301,THE SUNDEW,
6302,THE SUNDEW,The deep scent of the heather burns
6303,THE SUNDEW,"About it; breathless though it be,"

6325,THE SUNDEW,
6326,THE SUNDEW,"My sundew, grown of gentle days,"
6327,THE SUNDEW,In these green miles the spring begun
6328,THE SUNDEW,Thy growth ere April had half done
6329,THE SUNDEW,With the soft secret of her ways
6330,THE SUNDEW,Or June made ready for the sun.
6331,THE SUNDEW,
6332,THE SUNDEW,"O red-lipped mouth of marsh-flower,"
6333,THE SUNDEW,I have a secret halved with thee.
6334,THE SUNDEW,The name that is love's name to me
6335,THE SUNDEW,"Thou knowest, and the face of her"
6336,THE SUNDEW,Who is my festival to see.
6337,THE SUNDEW,
6338,THE SUNDEW,"The hard sun, as thy petals knew,"
6339,THE SUNDEW,Coloured the heavy moss-water:
6340,THE SUNDEW,Thou wert not worth green midsummer
6341,THE SUNDEW,"Nor fit to live to August blue,"

6353,FÉLISE,"Among the downs, between the trees,"
6354,FÉLISE,"In fields that knew our feet last year,"
6355,FÉLISE,"In sight of quiet sands and seas,"
6356,FÉLISE,"This year, Félise?"
6357,FÉLISE,
6358,FÉLISE,Who knows what word were best to say?
6359,FÉLISE,For last year's leaves lie dead and red
6360,FÉLISE,"On this sweet day, in this green May,"
6361,FÉLISE,And barren corn makes bitter bread.
6362,FÉLISE,What shall be said?
6363,FÉLISE,
6364,FÉLISE,"Here as last year the fields begin,"
6365,FÉLISE,A fire of flowers and glowing grass;
6366,FÉLISE,"The old fields we laughed and lingered in,"
6367,FÉLISE,"Seeing each our souls in last year's glass,"
6368,FÉLISE,"Félise, alas!"

6370,FÉLISE,"Shall we not laugh, shall we not weep,"
6371,FÉLISE,"Not we, though this be as it is?"
6372,FÉLISE,For love awake or love asleep
6373,FÉLISE,"Ends in a laugh, a dream, a kiss,"
6374,FÉLISE,A song like this.
6375,FÉLISE,
6376,FÉLISE,"I that have slept awake, and you"
6377,FÉLISE,"Sleep, who last year were well awake,"
6378,FÉLISE,"Though love do all that love can do,"

6382,FÉLISE,"The great sea, faultless as a flower,"
6383,FÉLISE,"Throbs, trembling under beam and breeze,"
6384,FÉLISE,And laughs with love of the amorous hour.
6385,FÉLISE,"I found you fairer once, Félise,"
6386,FÉLISE,Than flowers or seas.
6387,FÉLISE,
6388,FÉLISE,We played at bondsman and at queen;
6389,FÉLISE,But as the days change men change too;
6390,FÉLISE,"I find the grey sea's notes of green,"
6391,FÉLISE,"The green sea's fervent flakes of blue,"
6392,FÉLISE,More fair than you.
6393,FÉLISE,
6394,FÉLISE,Your beauty is not over fair
6395,FÉLISE,"Now in mine eyes, who am grown up wise."
6396,FÉLISE,The smell of flowers in all your hair
6397,FÉLISE,Allures not now; no sigh replies
6398,FÉLISE,If your heart sighs.
6399,FÉLISE,
6400,FÉLISE,"But you sigh seldom, you sleep sound,"
6401,FÉLISE,You find love's new name good enough.
6402,FÉLISE,Less sweet I find it than I found
6403,FÉLISE,The sweetest name that ever love
6404,FÉLISE,Grew weary of.
6405,FÉLISE,
6406,FÉLISE,"My snake with bright bland eyes, my snake"
6407,FÉLISE,"Grown tame and glad to be caressed,"
6408,FÉLISE,With lips athirst for mine to slake
6409,FÉLISE,Their tender fever! who had guessed
6410,FÉLISE,You loved me best?
6411,FÉLISE,
6412,FÉLISE,"I had died for this last year, to know"
6413,FÉLISE,You loved me. Who shall turn on fate?
6414,FÉLISE,I care not if love come or go
6415,FÉLISE,"Now, though your love seek mine for mate."
6416,FÉLISE,It is too late.
6417,FÉLISE,
6418,FÉLISE,The dust of many strange desires
6419,FÉLISE,Lies deep between us; in our eyes
6420,FÉLISE,Dead smoke of perishable fires
6421,FÉLISE,"Flickers, a fume in air and skies,"
6422,FÉLISE,A steam of sighs.
6423,FÉLISE,
6424,FÉLISE,You loved me and you loved me not;
6425,FÉLISE,"A little, much, and overmuch."
6426,FÉLISE,Will you forget as I forgot?
6427,FÉLISE,Let all dead things lie dead; none such
6428,FÉLISE,Are soft to touch.
6429,FÉLISE,
6430,FÉLISE,"I love you and I do not love,"
6431,FÉLISE,"Too much, a little, not at all;"
6432,FÉLISE,"Too much, and never yet enough."
6433,FÉLISE,Birds quick to fledge and fly at call
6434,FÉLISE,Are quick to fall.
6435,FÉLISE,
6436,FÉLISE,"And these love longer now than men,"
6437,FÉLISE,And larger loves than ours are these.
6438,FÉLISE,No diver brings up love again
6439,FÉLISE,"Dropped once, my beautiful Félise,"
6440,FÉLISE,In such cold seas.
6441,FÉLISE,
6442,FÉLISE,"Gone deeper than all plummets sound,"
6443,FÉLISE,Where in the dim green dayless day
6444,FÉLISE,The life of such dead things lies bound
6445,FÉLISE,"As the sea feeds on, wreck and stray"
6446,FÉLISE,And castaway.
6447,FÉLISE,
6448,FÉLISE,"Can I forget? yea, that can I,"
6449,FÉLISE,"And that can all men; so will you,"
6450,FÉLISE,"Alive, or later, when you die."
6451,FÉLISE,"Ah, but the love you plead was true?"
6452,FÉLISE,Was mine not too?
6453,FÉLISE,
6454,FÉLISE,I loved you for that name of yours
6455,FÉLISE,"Long ere we met, and long enough."
6456,FÉLISE,Now that one thing of all endures--
6457,FÉLISE,The sweetest name that ever love
6458,FÉLISE,Waxed weary of.
6459,FÉLISE,
6460,FÉLISE,"Like colours in the sea, like flowers,"
6461,FÉLISE,Like a cat's splendid circled eyes
6462,FÉLISE,"That wax and wane with love for hours,"
6463,FÉLISE,"Green as green flame, blue-grey like skies,"
6464,FÉLISE,And soft like sighs--
6465,FÉLISE,
6466,FÉLISE,"And all these only like your name,"
6467,FÉLISE,And your name full of all of these.
6468,FÉLISE,"I say it, and it sounds the same--"
6469,FÉLISE,"Save that I say it now at ease,"
6470,FÉLISE,"Your name, Félise."
6471,FÉLISE,
6472,FÉLISE,"I said ""she must be swift and white,"
6473,FÉLISE,"And subtly warm, and half perverse,"
6474,FÉLISE,"And sweet like sharp soft fruit to bite,"
6475,FÉLISE,"And like a snake's love lithe and fierce."""
6476,FÉLISE,Men have guessed worse.
6477,FÉLISE,
6478,FÉLISE,What was the song I made of you
6479,FÉLISE,Here where the grass forgets our feet
6480,FÉLISE,As afternoon forgets the dew?
6481,FÉLISE,"Ah that such sweet things should be fleet,"
6482,FÉLISE,Such fleet things sweet!
6483,FÉLISE,
6484,FÉLISE,"As afternoon forgets the dew,"
6485,FÉLISE,"As time in time forgets all men,"
6486,FÉLISE,"As our old place forgets us two,"
6487,FÉLISE,Who might have turned to one thing then
6488,FÉLISE,But not again.
6489,FÉLISE,
6490,FÉLISE,O lips that mine have grown into
6491,FÉLISE,"Like April's kissing May,"
6492,FÉLISE,O fervent eyelids letting through
6493,FÉLISE,"Those eyes the greenest of things blue,"
6494,FÉLISE,"The bluest of things grey,"
6495,FÉLISE,
6496,FÉLISE,"If you were I and I were you,"
6497,FÉLISE,"How could I love you, say?"
6498,FÉLISE,"How could the roseleaf love the rue,"
6499,FÉLISE,"The day love nightfall and her dew,"
6500,FÉLISE,Though night may love the day?
6501,FÉLISE,
6502,FÉLISE,You loved it may be more than I;
6503,FÉLISE,We know not; love is hard to seize.
6504,FÉLISE,And all things are not good to try;
6505,FÉLISE,And lifelong loves the worst of these
6506,FÉLISE,"For us, Félise."
6507,FÉLISE,
6508,FÉLISE,"Ah, take the season and have done,"
6509,FÉLISE,Love well the hour and let it go:
6510,FÉLISE,"Two souls may sleep and wake up one,"
6511,FÉLISE,"Or dream they wake and find it so,"
6512,FÉLISE,And then--you know.
6513,FÉLISE,
6514,FÉLISE,Kiss me once hard as though a flame
6515,FÉLISE,Lay on my lips and made them fire;
6516,FÉLISE,"The same lips now, and not the same;"
6517,FÉLISE,What breath shall fill and re-inspire
6518,FÉLISE,A dead desire?
6519,FÉLISE,
6520,FÉLISE,The old song sounds hollower in mine ear
6521,FÉLISE,Than thin keen sounds of dead men's speech--
6522,FÉLISE,A noise one hears and would not hear;
6523,FÉLISE,"Too strong to die, too weak to reach"
6524,FÉLISE,From wave to beach.
6525,FÉLISE,
6526,FÉLISE,"We stand on either side the sea,"
6527,FÉLISE,"Stretch hands, blow kisses, laugh and lean"
6528,FÉLISE,"I toward you, you toward me;"
6529,FÉLISE,But what hears either save the keen
6530,FÉLISE,Grey sea between?
6531,FÉLISE,
6532,FÉLISE,"A year divides us, love from love,"
6533,FÉLISE,"Though you love now, though I loved then."
6534,FÉLISE,"The gulf is strait, but deep enough;"
6535,FÉLISE,"Who shall recross, who among men"
6536,FÉLISE,Shall cross again?
6537,FÉLISE,
6538,FÉLISE,"Love was a jest last year, you said,"
6539,FÉLISE,"And what lives surely, surely dies."
6540,FÉLISE,"Even so; but now that love is dead,"
6541,FÉLISE,"Shall love rekindle from wet eyes,"
6542,FÉLISE,From subtle sighs?
6543,FÉLISE,
6544,FÉLISE,For many loves are good to see;
6545,FÉLISE,"Mutable loves, and loves perverse;"
6546,FÉLISE,"But there is nothing, nor shall be,"
6547,FÉLISE,"So sweet, so wicked, but my verse"
6548,FÉLISE,Can dream of worse.
6549,FÉLISE,
6550,FÉLISE,For we that sing and you that love
6551,FÉLISE,"Know that which man may, only we."
6552,FÉLISE,"The rest live under us; above,"
6553,FÉLISE,"Live the great gods in heaven, and see"
6554,FÉLISE,What things shall be.
6555,FÉLISE,
6556,FÉLISE,So this thing is and must be so;
6557,FÉLISE,"For man dies, and love also dies."
6558,FÉLISE,Though yet love's ghost moves to and fro
6559,FÉLISE,"The sea-green mirrors of your eyes,"
6560,FÉLISE,"And laughs, and lies."
6561,FÉLISE,
6562,FÉLISE,"Eyes coloured like a water-flower,"
6563,FÉLISE,And deeper than the green sea's glass;
6564,FÉLISE,Eyes that remember one sweet hour--
6565,FÉLISE,In vain we swore it should not pass;
6566,FÉLISE,"In vain, alas!"
6567,FÉLISE,
6568,FÉLISE,"Ah my Félise, if love or sin,"
6569,FÉLISE,"If shame or fear could hold it fast,"
6570,FÉLISE,"Should we not hold it? Love wears thin,"
6571,FÉLISE,And they laugh well who laugh the last.
6572,FÉLISE,Is it not past?
6573,FÉLISE,
6574,FÉLISE,"The gods, the gods are stronger; time"
6575,FÉLISE,"Falls down before them, all men's knees"
6576,FÉLISE,"Bow, all men's prayers and sorrows climb"
6577,FÉLISE,"Like incense towards them; yea, for these"
6578,FÉLISE,"Are gods, Félise."
6579,FÉLISE,
6580,FÉLISE,"Immortal are they, clothed with powers,"
6581,FÉLISE,Not to be comforted at all;
6582,FÉLISE,Lords over all the fruitless hours;
6583,FÉLISE,"Too great to appease, too high to appal,"
6584,FÉLISE,Too far to call.
6585,FÉLISE,
6586,FÉLISE,"For none shall move the most high gods,"
6587,FÉLISE,"Who are most sad, being cruel; none"
6588,FÉLISE,Shall break or take away the rods
6589,FÉLISE,"Wherewith they scourge us, not as one"
6590,FÉLISE,That smites a son.
6591,FÉLISE,
6592,FÉLISE,By many a name of many a creed
6593,FÉLISE,"We have called upon them, since the sands"
6594,FÉLISE,"Fell through time's hour-glass first, a seed"
6595,FÉLISE,Of life; and out of many lands
6596,FÉLISE,Have we stretched hands.
6597,FÉLISE,
6598,FÉLISE,When have they heard us? who hath known
6599,FÉLISE,"Their faces, climbed unto their feet,"
6600,FÉLISE,"Felt them and found them? Laugh or groan,"
6601,FÉLISE,Doth heaven remurmur and repeat
6602,FÉLISE,Sad sounds or sweet?
6603,FÉLISE,
6604,FÉLISE,Do the stars answer? in the night
6605,FÉLISE,Have ye found comfort? or by day
6606,FÉLISE,"Have ye seen gods? What hope, what light,"
6607,FÉLISE,Falls from the farthest starriest way
6608,FÉLISE,On you that pray?
6609,FÉLISE,
6610,FÉLISE,"Are the skies wet because we weep,"
6611,FÉLISE,Or fair because of any mirth?
6612,FÉLISE,Cry out; they are gods; perchance they sleep;
6613,FÉLISE,"Cry; thou shalt know what prayers are worth,"
6614,FÉLISE,Thou dust and earth.
6615,FÉLISE,
6616,FÉLISE,"O earth, thou art fair; O dust, thou art great;"
6617,FÉLISE,"O laughing lips and lips that mourn,"
6618,FÉLISE,"Pray, till ye feel the exceeding weight"
6619,FÉLISE,"Of God's intolerable scorn,"
6620,FÉLISE,Not to be borne.
6621,FÉLISE,
6622,FÉLISE,"Behold, there is no grief like this;"
6623,FÉLISE,"The barren blossom of thy prayer,"
6624,FÉLISE,Thou shalt find out how sweet it is.
6625,FÉLISE,"O fools and blind, what seek ye there,"
6626,FÉLISE,High up in the air?
6627,FÉLISE,
6628,FÉLISE,"Ye must have gods, the friends of men,"
6629,FÉLISE,"Merciful gods, compassionate,"
6630,FÉLISE,And these shall answer you again.
6631,FÉLISE,"Will ye beat always at the gate,"
6632,FÉLISE,Ye fools of fate?
6633,FÉLISE,
6634,FÉLISE,"Ye fools and blind; for this is sure,"
6635,FÉLISE,"That all ye shall not live, but die."
6636,FÉLISE,"Lo, what thing have ye found endure?"
6637,FÉLISE,Or what thing have ye found on high
6638,FÉLISE,Past the blind sky?
6639,FÉLISE,
6640,FÉLISE,"The ghosts of words and dusty dreams,"
6641,FÉLISE,"Old memories, faiths infirm and dead."
6642,FÉLISE,Ye fools; for which among you deems
6643,FÉLISE,His prayer can alter green to red
6644,FÉLISE,Or stones to bread?
6645,FÉLISE,
6646,FÉLISE,Why should ye bear with hopes and fears
6647,FÉLISE,"Till all these things be drawn in one,"
6648,FÉLISE,"The sound of iron-footed years,"
6649,FÉLISE,And all the oppression that is done
6650,FÉLISE,Under the sun?
6651,FÉLISE,
6652,FÉLISE,"Ye might end surely, surely pass"
6653,FÉLISE,"Out of the multitude of things,"
6654,FÉLISE,"Under the dust, beneath the grass,"
6655,FÉLISE,"Deep in dim death, where no thought stings,"
6656,FÉLISE,No record clings.
6657,FÉLISE,
6658,FÉLISE,"No memory more of love or hate,"
6659,FÉLISE,"No trouble, nothing that aspires,"
6660,FÉLISE,"No sleepless labour thwarting fate,"
6661,FÉLISE,"And thwarted; where no travail tires,"
6662,FÉLISE,Where no faith fires.
6663,FÉLISE,
6664,FÉLISE,"All passes, nought that has been is,"
6665,FÉLISE,Things good and evil have one end.
6666,FÉLISE,Can anything be otherwise
6667,FÉLISE,Though all men swear all things would mend
6668,FÉLISE,With God to friend?
6669,FÉLISE,
6670,FÉLISE,"Can ye beat off one wave with prayer,"
6671,FÉLISE,Can ye move mountains? bid the flower
6672,FÉLISE,Take flight and turn to a bird in the air?
6673,FÉLISE,Can ye hold fast for shine or shower
6674,FÉLISE,One wingless hour?
6675,FÉLISE,
6676,FÉLISE,"Ah sweet, and we too, can we bring"
6677,FÉLISE,"One sigh back, bid one smile revive?"
6678,FÉLISE,"Can God restore one ruined thing,"
6679,FÉLISE,Or he who slays our souls alive
6680,FÉLISE,Make dead things thrive?
6681,FÉLISE,
6682,FÉLISE,"Two gifts perforce he has given us yet,"
6683,FÉLISE,Though sad things stay and glad things fly;
6684,FÉLISE,"Two gifts he has given us, to forget"
6685,FÉLISE,"All glad and sad things that go by,"
6686,FÉLISE,And then to die.
6687,FÉLISE,
6688,FÉLISE,"We know not whether death be good,"
6689,FÉLISE,But life at least it will not be:
6690,FÉLISE,"Men will stand saddening as we stood,"
6691,FÉLISE,Watch the same fields and skies as we
6692,FÉLISE,And the same sea.
6693,FÉLISE,
6694,FÉLISE,"Let this be said between us here,"
6695,FÉLISE,One love grows green when one turns grey;
6696,FÉLISE,This year knows nothing of last year;
6697,FÉLISE,To-morrow has no more to say
6698,FÉLISE,To yesterday.
6699,FÉLISE,
6700,FÉLISE,"Live and let live, as I will do,"
6701,FÉLISE,"Love and let love, and so will I."
6702,FÉLISE,"But, sweet, for me no more with you:"
6703,FÉLISE,"Not while I live, not though I die."
6704,FÉLISE,"Goodnight, goodbye."
6705,FÉLISE,

6710,AN INTERLUDE,
6711,AN INTERLUDE,
6712,AN INTERLUDE,"In the greenest growth of the Maytime,"
6713,AN INTERLUDE,"I rode where the woods were wet,"
6714,AN INTERLUDE,Between the dawn and the daytime;
6715,AN INTERLUDE,The spring was glad that we met.
6716,AN INTERLUDE,
6717,AN INTERLUDE,"There was something the season wanted,"
6718,AN INTERLUDE,Though the ways and the woods smelt sweet;
6719,AN INTERLUDE,"The breath at your lips that panted,"
6720,AN INTERLUDE,The pulse of the grass at your feet.
6721,AN INTERLUDE,
6722,AN INTERLUDE,"You came, and the sun came after,"
6723,AN INTERLUDE,And the green grew golden above;
6724,AN INTERLUDE,"And the flag-flowers lightened with laughter,"
6725,AN INTERLUDE,And the meadow-sweet shook with love.
6726,AN INTERLUDE,
6727,AN INTERLUDE,Your feet in the full-grown grasses
6728,AN INTERLUDE,Moved soft as a weak wind blows;
6729,AN INTERLUDE,"You passed me as April passes,"
6730,AN INTERLUDE,With face made out of a rose.
6731,AN INTERLUDE,
6732,AN INTERLUDE,"By the stream where the stems were slender,"
6733,AN INTERLUDE,Your bright foot paused at the sedge;
6734,AN INTERLUDE,It might be to watch the tender
6735,AN INTERLUDE,"Light leaves in the springtime hedge,"
6736,AN INTERLUDE,
6737,AN INTERLUDE,On boughs that the sweet month blanches
6738,AN INTERLUDE,With flowery frost of May:
6739,AN INTERLUDE,"It might be a bird in the branches,"
6740,AN INTERLUDE,It might be a thorn in the way.
6741,AN INTERLUDE,
6742,AN INTERLUDE,I waited to watch you linger
6743,AN INTERLUDE,"With foot drawn back from the dew,"
6744,AN INTERLUDE,Till a sunbeam straight like a finger
6745,AN INTERLUDE,Struck sharp through the leaves at you.
6746,AN INTERLUDE,
6747,AN INTERLUDE,"And a bird overhead sang _Follow_,"
6748,AN INTERLUDE,And a bird to the right sang _Here_;
6749,AN INTERLUDE,"And the arch of the leaves was hollow,"
6750,AN INTERLUDE,And the meaning of May was clear.
6751,AN INTERLUDE,
6752,AN INTERLUDE,"I saw where the sun's hand pointed,"
6753,AN INTERLUDE,I knew what the bird's note said;
6754,AN INTERLUDE,"By the dawn and the dewfall anointed,"
6755,AN INTERLUDE,You were queen by the gold on your head.
6756,AN INTERLUDE,
6757,AN INTERLUDE,As the glimpse of a burnt-out ember
6758,AN INTERLUDE,"Recalls a regret of the sun,"
6759,AN INTERLUDE,"I remember, forget, and remember"
6760,AN INTERLUDE,What Love saw done and undone.
6761,AN INTERLUDE,
6762,AN INTERLUDE,"I remember the way we parted,"
6763,AN INTERLUDE,The day and the way we met;
6764,AN INTERLUDE,"You hoped we were both broken-hearted,"
6765,AN INTERLUDE,And knew we should both forget.
6766,AN INTERLUDE,
6767,AN INTERLUDE,And May with her world in flower
6768,AN INTERLUDE,Seemed still to murmur and smile
6769,AN INTERLUDE,As you murmured and smiled for an hour;
6770,AN INTERLUDE,I saw you turn at the stile.
6771,AN INTERLUDE,
6772,AN INTERLUDE,A hand like a white wood-blossom
6773,AN INTERLUDE,"You lifted, and waved, and passed,"
6774,AN INTERLUDE,"With head hung down to the bosom,"
6775,AN INTERLUDE,"And pale, as it seemed, at last."
6776,AN INTERLUDE,
6777,AN INTERLUDE,And the best and the worst of this is
6778,AN INTERLUDE,That neither is most to blame
6779,AN INTERLUDE,If you've forgotten my kisses
6780,AN INTERLUDE,And I've forgotten your name.

6787,HENDECASYLLABICS,
6788,HENDECASYLLABICS,In the month of the long decline of roses
6789,HENDECASYLLABICS,"I, beholding the summer dead before me,"
6790,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Set my face to the sea and journeyed silent,"
6791,HENDECASYLLABICS,Gazing eagerly where above the sea-mark
6792,HENDECASYLLABICS,Flame as fierce as the fervid eyes of lions
6793,HENDECASYLLABICS,Half divided the eyelids of the sunset;
6794,HENDECASYLLABICS,Till I heard as it were a noise of waters
6795,HENDECASYLLABICS,Moving tremulous under feet of angels
6796,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Multitudinous, out of all the heavens;"
6797,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Knew the fluttering wind, the fluttered foliage,"
6798,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Shaken fitfully, full of sound and shadow;"
6799,HENDECASYLLABICS,"And saw, trodden upon by noiseless angels,"
6800,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Long mysterious reaches fed with moonlight,"
6801,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Sweet sad straits in a soft subsiding channel,"
6802,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Blown about by the lips of winds I knew not,"
6803,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Winds not born in the north nor any quarter,"
6804,HENDECASYLLABICS,Winds not warm with the south nor any sunshine;
6805,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Heard between them a voice of exultation,"
6806,HENDECASYLLABICS,"""Lo, the summer is dead, the sun is faded,"
6807,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Even like as a leaf the year is withered,"
6808,HENDECASYLLABICS,All the fruits of the day from all her branches
6809,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Gathered, neither is any left to gather."
6810,HENDECASYLLABICS,"All the flowers are dead, the tender blossoms,"
6811,HENDECASYLLABICS,"All are taken away; the season wasted,"
6812,HENDECASYLLABICS,Like an ember among the fallen ashes.
6813,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Now with light of the winter days, with moonlight,"
6814,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Light of snow, and the bitter light of hoarfrost,"
6815,HENDECASYLLABICS,"We bring flowers that fade not after autumn,"
6816,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Pale white chaplets and crowns of latter seasons,"
6817,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Fair false leaves (but the summer leaves were falser),"
6818,HENDECASYLLABICS,Woven under the eyes of stars and planets
6819,HENDECASYLLABICS,When low light was upon the windy reaches
6820,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Where the flower of foam was blown, a lily"
6821,HENDECASYLLABICS,Dropt among the sonorous fruitless furrows
6822,HENDECASYLLABICS,And green fields of the sea that make no pasture:
6823,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Since the winter begins, the weeping winter,"
6824,HENDECASYLLABICS,"All whose flowers are tears, and round his temples"
6825,HENDECASYLLABICS,"Iron blossom of frost is bound for ever."""

6833,SAPPHICS,"All the night sleep came not upon my eyelids,"
6834,SAPPHICS,"Shed not dew, nor shook nor unclosed a feather,"
6835,SAPPHICS,Yet with lips shut close and with eyes of iron
6836,SAPPHICS,Stood and beheld me.
6837,SAPPHICS,
6838,SAPPHICS,Then to me so lying awake a vision
6839,SAPPHICS,"Came without sleep over the seas and touched me,"
6840,SAPPHICS,"Softly touched mine eyelids and lips; and I too,"
6841,SAPPHICS,"Full of the vision,"
6842,SAPPHICS,
6843,SAPPHICS,"Saw the white implacable Aphrodite,"
6844,SAPPHICS,Saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandalled
6845,SAPPHICS,Shine as fire of sunset on western waters;
6846,SAPPHICS,Saw the reluctant
6847,SAPPHICS,
6848,SAPPHICS,"Feet, the straining plumes of the doves that drew her,"
6849,SAPPHICS,"Looking always, looking with necks reverted,"
6850,SAPPHICS,"Back to Lesbos, back to the hills whereunder"
6851,SAPPHICS,Shone Mitylene;
6852,SAPPHICS,
6853,SAPPHICS,Heard the flying feet of the Loves behind her
6854,SAPPHICS,"Make a sudden thunder upon the waters,"
6855,SAPPHICS,As the thunder flung from the strong unclosing
6856,SAPPHICS,Wings of a great wind.
6857,SAPPHICS,
6858,SAPPHICS,"So the goddess fled from her place, with awful"
6859,SAPPHICS,Sound of feet and thunder of wings around her;
6860,SAPPHICS,While behind a clamour of singing women
6861,SAPPHICS,Severed the twilight.
6862,SAPPHICS,
6863,SAPPHICS,"Ah the singing, ah the delight, the passion!"
6864,SAPPHICS,"All the Loves wept, listening; sick with anguish,"
6865,SAPPHICS,Stood the crowned nine Muses about Apollo;
6866,SAPPHICS,"Fear was upon them,"
6867,SAPPHICS,
6868,SAPPHICS,While the tenth sang wonderful things they knew not.
6869,SAPPHICS,"Ah the tenth, the Lesbian! the nine were silent,"
6870,SAPPHICS,None endured the sound of her song for weeping;
6871,SAPPHICS,"Laurel by laurel,"
6872,SAPPHICS,
6873,SAPPHICS,"Faded all their crowns; but about her forehead,"
6874,SAPPHICS,Round her woven tresses and ashen temples
6875,SAPPHICS,"White as dead snow, paler than grass in summer,"
6876,SAPPHICS,"Ravaged with kisses,"
6877,SAPPHICS,
6878,SAPPHICS,Shone a light of fire as a crown for ever.
6879,SAPPHICS,"Yea, almost the implacable Aphrodite"
6880,SAPPHICS,"Paused, and almost wept; such a song was that song."
6881,SAPPHICS,"Yea, by her name too"
6882,SAPPHICS,
6883,SAPPHICS,"Called her, saying, ""Turn to me, O my Sappho;"""
6884,SAPPHICS,"Yet she turned her face from the Loves, she saw not"
6885,SAPPHICS,"Tears for laughter darken immortal eyelids,"
6886,SAPPHICS,Heard not about her
6887,SAPPHICS,
6888,SAPPHICS,"Fearful fitful wings of the doves departing,"
6889,SAPPHICS,Saw not how the bosom of Aphrodite
6890,SAPPHICS,"Shook with weeping, saw not her shaken raiment,"
6891,SAPPHICS,Saw not her hands wrung;
6892,SAPPHICS,
6893,SAPPHICS,Saw the Lesbians kissing across their smitten
6894,SAPPHICS,"Lutes with lips more sweet than the sound of lute-strings,"
6895,SAPPHICS,"Mouth to mouth and hand upon hand, her chosen,"
6896,SAPPHICS,Fairer than all men;
6897,SAPPHICS,
6898,SAPPHICS,"Only saw the beautiful lips and fingers,"
6899,SAPPHICS,"Full of songs and kisses and little whispers,"
6900,SAPPHICS,Full of music; only beheld among them
6901,SAPPHICS,"Soar, as a bird soars"
6902,SAPPHICS,
6903,SAPPHICS,"Newly fledged, her visible song, a marvel,"
6904,SAPPHICS,"Made of perfect sound and exceeding passion,"

6908,SAPPHICS,"Then rejoiced she, laughing with love, and scattered"
6909,SAPPHICS,"Roses, awful roses of holy blossom;"
6910,SAPPHICS,Then the Loves thronged sadly with hidden faces
6911,SAPPHICS,"Round Aphrodite,"
6912,SAPPHICS,
6913,SAPPHICS,"Then the Muses, stricken at heart, were silent;"
6914,SAPPHICS,"Yea, the gods waxed pale; such a song was that song."
6915,SAPPHICS,"All reluctant, all with a fresh repulsion,"
6916,SAPPHICS,Fled from before her.
6917,SAPPHICS,
6918,SAPPHICS,"All withdrew long since, and the land was barren,"
6919,SAPPHICS,Full of fruitless women and music only.
6920,SAPPHICS,"Now perchance, when winds are assuaged at sunset,"
6921,SAPPHICS,"Lulled at the dewfall,"
6922,SAPPHICS,
6923,SAPPHICS,"By the grey sea-side, unassuaged, unheard of,"
6924,SAPPHICS,"Unbeloved, unseen in the ebb of twilight,"
6925,SAPPHICS,"Ghosts of outcast women return lamenting,"
6926,SAPPHICS,"Purged not in Lethe,"
6927,SAPPHICS,
6928,SAPPHICS,"Clothed about with flame and with tears, and singing"

6938,AT ELEUSIS,
6939,AT ELEUSIS,"Men of Eleusis, ye that with long staves"
6940,AT ELEUSIS,"Sit in the market-houses, and speak words"
6941,AT ELEUSIS,Made sweet with wisdom as the rare wine is
6942,AT ELEUSIS,Thickened with honey; and ye sons of these
6943,AT ELEUSIS,Who in the glad thick streets go up and down
6944,AT ELEUSIS,For pastime or grave traffic or mere chance;
6945,AT ELEUSIS,And all fair women having rings of gold
6946,AT ELEUSIS,On hands or hair; and chiefest over these
6947,AT ELEUSIS,"I name you, daughters of this man the king,"
6948,AT ELEUSIS,Who dipping deep smooth pitchers of pure brass
6949,AT ELEUSIS,"Under the bubbled wells, till each round lip"
6950,AT ELEUSIS,"Stooped with loose gurgle of waters incoming,"
6951,AT ELEUSIS,"Found me an old sick woman, lamed and lean,"
6952,AT ELEUSIS,Beside a growth of builded olive-boughs
6953,AT ELEUSIS,Whence multiplied thick song of thick-plumed throats--
6954,AT ELEUSIS,Also wet tears filled up my hollow hands
6955,AT ELEUSIS,By reason of my crying into them--
6956,AT ELEUSIS,And pitied me; for as cold water ran
6957,AT ELEUSIS,"And washed the pitchers full from lip to lip,"
6958,AT ELEUSIS,So washed both eyes full the strong salt of tears.
6959,AT ELEUSIS,"And ye put water to my mouth, made sweet"
6960,AT ELEUSIS,With brown hill-berries; so in time I spoke
6961,AT ELEUSIS,And gathered my loose knees from under me.
6962,AT ELEUSIS,Moreover in the broad fair halls this month
6963,AT ELEUSIS,Have I found space and bountiful abode
6964,AT ELEUSIS,"To please me. I Demeter speak of this,"
6965,AT ELEUSIS,Who am the mother and the mate of things:
6966,AT ELEUSIS,For as ill men by drugs or singing words
6967,AT ELEUSIS,Shut the doors inward of the narrowed womb
6968,AT ELEUSIS,"Like a lock bolted with round iron through,"
6969,AT ELEUSIS,Thus I shut up the body and sweet mouth
6970,AT ELEUSIS,"Of all soft pasture and the tender land,"
6971,AT ELEUSIS,So that no seed can enter in by it
6972,AT ELEUSIS,"Though one sow thickly, nor some grain get out"
6973,AT ELEUSIS,Past the hard clods men cleave and bite with steel
6974,AT ELEUSIS,To widen the sealed lips of them for use.
6975,AT ELEUSIS,None of you is there in the peopled street
6976,AT ELEUSIS,But knows how all the dry-drawn furrows ache
6977,AT ELEUSIS,With no green spot made count of in the black:
6978,AT ELEUSIS,How the wind finds no comfortable grass
6979,AT ELEUSIS,Nor is assuaged with bud nor breath of herbs;
6980,AT ELEUSIS,"And in hot autumn when ye house the stacks,"
6981,AT ELEUSIS,"All fields are helpless in the sun, all trees"
6982,AT ELEUSIS,Stand as a man stripped out of all but skin.
6983,AT ELEUSIS,Nevertheless ye sick have help to get
6984,AT ELEUSIS,By means and stablished ordinance of God;
6985,AT ELEUSIS,For God is wiser than a good man is.
6986,AT ELEUSIS,But never shall new grass be sweet in earth
6987,AT ELEUSIS,Till I get righted of my wound and wrong
6988,AT ELEUSIS,By changing counsel of ill-minded Zeus.
6989,AT ELEUSIS,For of all other gods is none save me
6990,AT ELEUSIS,Clothed with like power to build and break the year.
6991,AT ELEUSIS,"I make the lesser green begin, when spring"
6992,AT ELEUSIS,Touches not earth but with one fearful foot;
6993,AT ELEUSIS,And as a careful gilder with grave art
6994,AT ELEUSIS,"Soberly colours and completes the face,"
6995,AT ELEUSIS,"Mouth, chin and all, of some sweet work in stone,"
6996,AT ELEUSIS,I carve the shapes of grass and tender corn
6997,AT ELEUSIS,And colour the ripe edges and long spikes
6998,AT ELEUSIS,"With the red increase and the grace of gold,"
6999,AT ELEUSIS,No tradesman in soft wools is cunninger
7000,AT ELEUSIS,To kill the secret of the fat white fleece
7001,AT ELEUSIS,With stains of blue and purple wrought in it.
7002,AT ELEUSIS,Three moons were made and three moons burnt away
7003,AT ELEUSIS,While I held journey hither out of Crete
7004,AT ELEUSIS,"Comfortless, tended by grave Hecate"
7005,AT ELEUSIS,Whom my wound stung with double iron point;
7006,AT ELEUSIS,For all my face was like a cloth wrung out
7007,AT ELEUSIS,"With close and weeping wrinkles, and both lids"
7008,AT ELEUSIS,Sodden with salt continuance of tears.
7009,AT ELEUSIS,For Hades and the sidelong will of Zeus
7010,AT ELEUSIS,"And that lame wisdom that has writhen feet,"
7011,AT ELEUSIS,"Cunning, begotten in the bed of Shame,"
7012,AT ELEUSIS,"These three took evil will at me, and made"
7013,AT ELEUSIS,Such counsel that when time got wing to fly
7014,AT ELEUSIS,This Hades out of summer and low fields
7015,AT ELEUSIS,Forced the bright body of Persephone:
7016,AT ELEUSIS,"Out of pure grass, where she lying down, red flowers"
7017,AT ELEUSIS,"Made their sharp little shadows on her sides,"
7018,AT ELEUSIS,"Pale heat, pale colour on pale maiden flesh--"
7019,AT ELEUSIS,"And chill water slid over her reddening feet,"
7020,AT ELEUSIS,"Killing the throbs in their soft blood; and birds,"
7021,AT ELEUSIS,"Perched next her elbow and pecking at her hair,"
7022,AT ELEUSIS,Stretched their necks more to see her than even to sing.
7023,AT ELEUSIS,A sharp thing is it I have need to say;
7024,AT ELEUSIS,For Hades holding both white wrists of hers
7025,AT ELEUSIS,Unloosed the girdle and with knot by knot
7026,AT ELEUSIS,"Bound her between his wheels upon the seat,"
7027,AT ELEUSIS,"Bound her pure body, holiest yet and dear"
7028,AT ELEUSIS,"To me and God as always, clothed about"
7029,AT ELEUSIS,With blossoms loosened as her knees went down.
7030,AT ELEUSIS,Let fall as she let go of this and this
7031,AT ELEUSIS,"By tens and twenties, tumbled to her feet,"
7032,AT ELEUSIS,White waifs or purple of the pasturage.
7033,AT ELEUSIS,Therefore with only going up and down
7034,AT ELEUSIS,"My feet were wasted, and the gracious air,"
7035,AT ELEUSIS,"To me discomfortable and dun, became"
7036,AT ELEUSIS,As weak smoke blowing in the under world.
7037,AT ELEUSIS,And finding in the process of ill days
7038,AT ELEUSIS,"What part had Zeus herein, and how as mate"
7039,AT ELEUSIS,"He coped with Hades, yokefellow in sin,"
7040,AT ELEUSIS,I set my lips against the meat of gods
7041,AT ELEUSIS,And drank not neither ate or slept in heaven.
7042,AT ELEUSIS,Nor in the golden greeting of their mouths
7043,AT ELEUSIS,"Did ear take note of me, nor eye at all"
7044,AT ELEUSIS,Track my feet going in the ways of them.
7045,AT ELEUSIS,Like a great fire on some strait slip of land
7046,AT ELEUSIS,Between two washing inlets of wet sea
7047,AT ELEUSIS,That burns the grass up to each lip of beach
7048,AT ELEUSIS,"And strengthens, waxing in the growth of wind,"
7049,AT ELEUSIS,"So burnt my soul in me at heaven and earth,"
7050,AT ELEUSIS,"Each way a ruin and a hungry plague,"
7051,AT ELEUSIS,Visible evil; nor could any night
7052,AT ELEUSIS,"Put cool between mine eyelids, nor the sun"
7053,AT ELEUSIS,With competence of gold fill out my want.
7054,AT ELEUSIS,"Yea so my flame burnt up the grass and stones,"
7055,AT ELEUSIS,"Shone to the salt-white edges of thin sea,"
7056,AT ELEUSIS,"Distempered all the gracious work, and made"
7057,AT ELEUSIS,"Sick change, unseasonable increase of days"
7058,AT ELEUSIS,And scant avail of seasons; for by this
7059,AT ELEUSIS,The fair gods faint in hollow heaven: there comes
7060,AT ELEUSIS,No taste of burnings of the twofold fat
7061,AT ELEUSIS,"To leave their palates smooth, nor in their lips"
7062,AT ELEUSIS,Soft rings of smoke and weak scent wandering;
7063,AT ELEUSIS,"All cattle waste and rot, and their ill smell"
7064,AT ELEUSIS,Grows alway from the lank unsavoury flesh
7065,AT ELEUSIS,That no man slays for offering; the sea
7066,AT ELEUSIS,And waters moved beneath the heath and corn
7067,AT ELEUSIS,"Preserve the people of fin-twinkling fish,"
7068,AT ELEUSIS,And river-flies feed thick upon the smooth;
7069,AT ELEUSIS,But all earth over is no man or bird
7070,AT ELEUSIS,(Except the sweet race of the kingfisher)
7071,AT ELEUSIS,That lacks not and is wearied with much loss.
7072,AT ELEUSIS,Meantime the purple inward of the house
7073,AT ELEUSIS,Was softened with all grace of scent and sound
7074,AT ELEUSIS,In ear and nostril perfecting my praise;
7075,AT ELEUSIS,Faint grape-flowers and cloven honey-cake
7076,AT ELEUSIS,And the just grain with dues of the shed salt
7077,AT ELEUSIS,Made me content: yet my hand loosened not
7078,AT ELEUSIS,Its gripe upon your harvest all year long.
7079,AT ELEUSIS,"While I, thus woman-muffled in wan flesh"
7080,AT ELEUSIS,"And waste externals of a perished face,"
7081,AT ELEUSIS,Preserved the levels of my wrath and love
7082,AT ELEUSIS,Patiently ruled; and with soft offices
7083,AT ELEUSIS,Cooled the sharp noons and busied the warm nights
7084,AT ELEUSIS,"In care of this my choice, this child my choice,"
7085,AT ELEUSIS,"Triptolemus, the king's selected son:"
7086,AT ELEUSIS,"That this fair yearlong body, which hath grown"
7087,AT ELEUSIS,Strong with strange milk upon the mortal lip
7088,AT ELEUSIS,"And nerved with half a god, might so increase"
7089,AT ELEUSIS,Outside the bulk and the bare scope of man:
7090,AT ELEUSIS,And waxen over large to hold within
7091,AT ELEUSIS,"Base breath of yours and this impoverished air,"
7092,AT ELEUSIS,"I might exalt him past the flame of stars,"
7093,AT ELEUSIS,The limit and walled reach of the great world.
7094,AT ELEUSIS,Therefore my breast made common to his mouth
7095,AT ELEUSIS,"Immortal savours, and the taste whereat"
7096,AT ELEUSIS,Twice their hard life strains out the coloured veins
7097,AT ELEUSIS,And twice its brain confirms the narrow shell.
7098,AT ELEUSIS,"Also at night, unwinding cloth from cloth"
7099,AT ELEUSIS,As who unhusks an almond to the white
7100,AT ELEUSIS,"And pastures curiously the purer taste,"
7101,AT ELEUSIS,"I bared the gracious limbs and the soft feet,"
7102,AT ELEUSIS,"Unswaddled the weak hands, and in mid ash"
7103,AT ELEUSIS,"Laid the sweet flesh of either feeble side,"
7104,AT ELEUSIS,More tender for impressure of some touch
7105,AT ELEUSIS,Than wax to any pen; and lit around
7106,AT ELEUSIS,"Fire, and made crawl the white worm-shapen flame,"
7107,AT ELEUSIS,And leap in little angers spark by spark
7108,AT ELEUSIS,At head at once and feet; and the faint hair
7109,AT ELEUSIS,"Hissed with rare sprinkles in the closer curl,"
7110,AT ELEUSIS,And like scaled oarage of a keen thin fish
7111,AT ELEUSIS,"In sea-water, so in pure fire his feet"
7112,AT ELEUSIS,"Struck out, and the flame bit not in his flesh,"
7113,AT ELEUSIS,"But like a kiss it curled his lip, and heat"
7114,AT ELEUSIS,Fluttered his eyelids; so each night I blew
7115,AT ELEUSIS,The hot ash red to purge him to full god.
7116,AT ELEUSIS,Ill is it when fear hungers in the soul
7117,AT ELEUSIS,"For painful food, and chokes thereon, being fed;"
7118,AT ELEUSIS,"And ill slant eyes interpret the straight sun,"
7119,AT ELEUSIS,But in their scope its white is wried to black:
7120,AT ELEUSIS,By the queen Metaneira mean I this;
7121,AT ELEUSIS,"For with sick wrath upon her lips, and heart"
7122,AT ELEUSIS,"Narrowing with fear the spleenful passages,"
7123,AT ELEUSIS,"She thought to thread this web's fine ravel out,"
7124,AT ELEUSIS,Nor leave her shuttle split in combing it;
7125,AT ELEUSIS,"Therefore she stole on us, and with hard sight"
7126,AT ELEUSIS,"Peered, and stooped close; then with pale open mouth"
7127,AT ELEUSIS,As the fire smote her in the eyes between
7128,AT ELEUSIS,"Cried, and the child's laugh, sharply shortening"
7129,AT ELEUSIS,"As fire doth under rain, fell off; the flame"
7130,AT ELEUSIS,"Writhed once all through and died, and in thick dark"
7131,AT ELEUSIS,"Tears fell from mine on the child's weeping eyes,"
7132,AT ELEUSIS,Eyes dispossessed of strong inheritance
7133,AT ELEUSIS,And mortal fallen anew. Who not the less
7134,AT ELEUSIS,From bud of beard to pale-grey flower of hair
7135,AT ELEUSIS,"Shall wax vinewise to a lordly vine, whose grapes"
7136,AT ELEUSIS,"Bleed the red heavy blood of swoln soft wine,"
7137,AT ELEUSIS,"Subtle with sharp leaves' intricacy, until"
7138,AT ELEUSIS,Full of white years and blossom of hoary days
7139,AT ELEUSIS,I take him perfected; for whose one sake
7140,AT ELEUSIS,I am thus gracious to the least who stands
7141,AT ELEUSIS,Filleted with white wool and girt upon
7142,AT ELEUSIS,As he whose prayer endures upon the lip
7143,AT ELEUSIS,And falls not waste: wherefore let sacrifice
7144,AT ELEUSIS,Burn and run red in all the wider ways;
7145,AT ELEUSIS,Seeing I have sworn by the pale temples' band
7146,AT ELEUSIS,And poppied hair of gold Persephone
7147,AT ELEUSIS,"Sad-tressed and pleached low down about her brows,"
7148,AT ELEUSIS,"And by the sorrow in her lips, and death"
7149,AT ELEUSIS,"Her dumb and mournful-mouthèd minister,"
7150,AT ELEUSIS,My word for you is eased of its harsh weight
7151,AT ELEUSIS,And doubled with soft promise; and your king
7152,AT ELEUSIS,"Triptolemus, this Celeus dead and swathed"
7153,AT ELEUSIS,"Purple and pale for golden burial,"
7154,AT ELEUSIS,"Shall be your helper in my services,"
7155,AT ELEUSIS,Dividing earth and reaping fruits thereof
7156,AT ELEUSIS,"In fields where wait, well-girt, well-wreathen, all"
7157,AT ELEUSIS,The heavy-handed seasons all year through;
7158,AT ELEUSIS,"Saving the choice of warm spear-headed grain,"
7159,AT ELEUSIS,And stooping sharp to the slant-sided share
7160,AT ELEUSIS,All beasts that furrow the remeasured land
7161,AT ELEUSIS,With their bowed necks of burden equable.

7168,AUGUST,
7169,AUGUST,"There were four apples on the bough,"
7170,AUGUST,"Half gold half red, that one might know"
7171,AUGUST,The blood was ripe inside the core;
7172,AUGUST,The colour of the leaves was more
7173,AUGUST,Like stems of yellow corn that grow
7174,AUGUST,Through all the gold June meadow's floor.
7175,AUGUST,
7176,AUGUST,The warm smell of the fruit was good
7177,AUGUST,"To feed on, and the split green wood,"
7178,AUGUST,With all its bearded lips and stains
7179,AUGUST,"Of mosses in the cloven veins,"
7180,AUGUST,"Most pleasant, if one lay or stood"
7181,AUGUST,In sunshine or in happy rains.
7182,AUGUST,
7183,AUGUST,"There were four apples on the tree,"
7184,AUGUST,"Red stained through gold, that all might see"
7185,AUGUST,The sun went warm from core to rind;
7186,AUGUST,The green leaves made the summer blind
7187,AUGUST,In that soft place they kept for me
7188,AUGUST,With golden apples shut behind.
7189,AUGUST,
7190,AUGUST,"The leaves caught gold across the sun,"
7191,AUGUST,And where the bluest air begun
7192,AUGUST,Thirsted for song to help the heat;
7193,AUGUST,As I to feel my lady's feet
7194,AUGUST,Draw close before the day were done;
7195,AUGUST,Both lips grew dry with dreams of it.
7196,AUGUST,
7197,AUGUST,In the mute August afternoon
7198,AUGUST,They trembled to some undertune
7199,AUGUST,Of music in the silver air;
7200,AUGUST,Great pleasure was it to be there
7201,AUGUST,Till green turned duskier and the moon
7202,AUGUST,Coloured the corn-sheaves like gold hair.
7203,AUGUST,
7204,AUGUST,That August time it was delight
7205,AUGUST,To watch the red moons wane to white
7206,AUGUST,'Twixt grey seamed stems of apple-trees;
7207,AUGUST,A sense of heavy harmonies
7208,AUGUST,"Grew on the growth of patient night,"
7209,AUGUST,More sweet than shapen music is.
7210,AUGUST,
7211,AUGUST,But some three hours before the moon
7212,AUGUST,"The air, still eager from the noon,"
7213,AUGUST,"Flagged after heat, not wholly dead;"
7214,AUGUST,Against the stem I leant my head;
7215,AUGUST,"The colour soothed me like a tune,"
7216,AUGUST,Green leaves all round the gold and red.
7217,AUGUST,
7218,AUGUST,I lay there till the warm smell grew
7219,AUGUST,"More sharp, when flecks of yellow dew"
7220,AUGUST,Between the round ripe leaves had blurred
7221,AUGUST,The rind with stain and wet; I heard
7222,AUGUST,"A wind that blew and breathed and blew,"
7223,AUGUST,Too weak to alter its one word.
7224,AUGUST,
7225,AUGUST,The wet leaves next the gentle fruit
7226,AUGUST,"Felt smoother, and the brown tree-root"
7227,AUGUST,Felt the mould warmer: I too felt
7228,AUGUST,(As water feels the slow gold melt
7229,AUGUST,Right through it when the day burns mute)
7230,AUGUST,The peace of time wherein love dwelt.
7231,AUGUST,
7232,AUGUST,"There were four apples on the tree,"
7233,AUGUST,Gold stained on red that all might see
7234,AUGUST,The sweet blood filled them to the core:
7235,AUGUST,The colour of her hair is more
7236,AUGUST,"Like stems of fair faint gold, that be"
7237,AUGUST,Mown from the harvest's middle floor.

7743,MESSALINA,
7744,MESSALINA,I am the queen of Italy.
7745,MESSALINA,These were the signs God set on me;
7746,MESSALINA,"A barren beauty subtle and sleek,"
7747,MESSALINA,"Curled carven hair, and cheeks worn wan"
7748,MESSALINA,"With fierce false lips of many a man,"
7749,MESSALINA,"Large temples where the blood ran weak,"
7750,MESSALINA,A mouth athirst and amorous
7751,MESSALINA,And hungering as the grave's mouth does
7752,MESSALINA,"That, being an-hungred, cannot speak."
7753,MESSALINA,

7756,AMESTRIS,
7757,AMESTRIS,I am the queen of Persians.
7758,AMESTRIS,My breasts were lordlier than bright swans.
7759,AMESTRIS,My body as amber fair and thin.
7760,AMESTRIS,"Strange flesh was given my lips for bread,"
7761,AMESTRIS,"With poisonous hours my days were fed,"
7762,AMESTRIS,And my feet shod with adder-skin.
7763,AMESTRIS,In Shushan toward Ecbatane
7764,AMESTRIS,"I wrought my joys with tears and pain,"
7765,AMESTRIS,My loves with blood and bitter sin.

7769,EPHRATH,
7770,EPHRATH,I am the queen of Rephaim.
7771,EPHRATH,"God, that some while refraineth him,"
7772,EPHRATH,Made in the end a spoil of me.
7773,EPHRATH,My rumour was upon the world
7774,EPHRATH,As strong sound of swoln water hurled
7775,EPHRATH,Through porches of the straining sea.
7776,EPHRATH,"My hair was like the flag-flower,"
7777,EPHRATH,And my breasts carven goodlier
7778,EPHRATH,Than beryl with chalcedony.

7783,PASITHEA,I am the queen of Cypriotes.
7784,PASITHEA,"Mine oarsmen, labouring with brown throats,"
7785,PASITHEA,Sang of me many a tender thing.
7786,PASITHEA,"My maidens, girdled loose and braced"
7787,PASITHEA,"With gold from bosom to white waist,"
7788,PASITHEA,Praised me between their wool-combing.
7789,PASITHEA,All that praise Venus all night long
7790,PASITHEA,With lips like speech and lids like song
7791,PASITHEA,Praised me till song lost heart to sing.

7795,ALACIEL,
7796,ALACIEL,I am the queen Alaciel.
7797,ALACIEL,My mouth was like that moist gold cell
7798,ALACIEL,Whereout the thickest honey drips.
7799,ALACIEL,Mine eyes were as a grey-green sea;
7800,ALACIEL,The amorous blood that smote on me
7801,ALACIEL,Smote to my feet and finger-tips.
7802,ALACIEL,"My throat was whiter than the dove,"
7803,ALACIEL,"Mine eyelids as the seals of love,"
7804,ALACIEL,And as the doors of love my lips.

7809,ERIGONE,I am the queen Erigone.
7810,ERIGONE,The wild wine shed as blood on me
7811,ERIGONE,Made my face brighter than a bride's.
7812,ERIGONE,"My large lips had the old thirst of earth,"
7813,ERIGONE,Mine arms the might of the old sea's girth
7814,ERIGONE,Bound round the whole world's iron sides.
7815,ERIGONE,Within mine eyes and in mine ears
7816,ERIGONE,"Were music and the wine of tears,"
7817,ERIGONE,"And light, and thunder of the tides."
7818,ERIGONE,"_Et hìc exeant, et dicat Bersabe regina_;"
7819,ERIGONE,
7820,ERIGONE,"Alas, God, for thy great pity"
7821,ERIGONE,"And for the might that is in thee,"
7822,ERIGONE,"Behold, I woful Bersabe"
7823,ERIGONE,Cry out with stoopings of my knee
7824,ERIGONE,And thy wrath laid and bound on me
7825,ERIGONE,Till I may see thy love.
7826,ERIGONE,"Behold, Lord, this child is grown"
7827,ERIGONE,Within me between bone and bone
7828,ERIGONE,"To make me mother of a son,"
7829,ERIGONE,Made of my body with strong moan;
7830,ERIGONE,There shall not be another one
7831,ERIGONE,That shall be made hereof.

7836,KING DAVID,"Lord God, alas, what shall I sain?"
7837,KING DAVID,"Lo, thou art as an hundred men"
7838,KING DAVID,Both to break and build again:
7839,KING DAVID,"The wild ways thou makest plain,"
7840,KING DAVID,"Thine hands hold the hail and rain,"
7841,KING DAVID,And thy fingers both grape and grain;
7842,KING DAVID,"Of their largess we be all well fain,"
7843,KING DAVID,And of their great pity:
7844,KING DAVID,"The sun thou madest of good gold,"
7845,KING DAVID,"Of clean silver the moon cold,"
7846,KING DAVID,All the great stars thou hast told
7847,KING DAVID,As thy cattle in thy fold
7848,KING DAVID,Every one by his name of old;
7849,KING DAVID,"Wind and water thou hast in hold,"
7850,KING DAVID,Both the land and the long sea;
7851,KING DAVID,"Both the green sea and the land,"
7852,KING DAVID,"Lord God, thou hast in hand,"
7853,KING DAVID,Both white water and grey sand;
7854,KING DAVID,Upon thy right or thy left hand
7855,KING DAVID,There is no man that may stand;
7856,KING DAVID,"Lord, thou rue on me."
7857,KING DAVID,"O wise Lord, if thou be keen"
7858,KING DAVID,"To note things amiss that been,"
7859,KING DAVID,I am not worth a shell of bean
7860,KING DAVID,More than an old mare meagre and lean;
7861,KING DAVID,"For all my wrong-doing with my queen,"
7862,KING DAVID,"It grew not of our heartès clean,"
7863,KING DAVID,But it began of her body.
7864,KING DAVID,For it fell in the hot May
7865,KING DAVID,I stood within a paven way
7866,KING DAVID,"Built of fair bright stone, perfay,"
7867,KING DAVID,That is as fire of night and day
7868,KING DAVID,And lighteth all my house.
7869,KING DAVID,"Therein be neither stones nor sticks,"
7870,KING DAVID,"Neither red nor white bricks,"
7871,KING DAVID,But for cubits five or six
7872,KING DAVID,There is most goodly sardonyx
7873,KING DAVID,And amber laid in rows.
7874,KING DAVID,"It goes round about my roofs,"
7875,KING DAVID,(If ye list ye shall have proofs)
7876,KING DAVID,"There is good space for horse and hoofs,"
7877,KING DAVID,Plain and nothing perilous.
7878,KING DAVID,"For the fair green weather's heat,"
7879,KING DAVID,"And for the smell of leavès sweet,"
7880,KING DAVID,"It is no marvel, well ye weet,"
7881,KING DAVID,A man to waxen amorous.
7882,KING DAVID,This I say now by my case
7883,KING DAVID,That spied forth of that royal place;
7884,KING DAVID,There I saw in no great space
7885,KING DAVID,"Mine own sweet, both body and face,"
7886,KING DAVID,Under the fresh boughs.
7887,KING DAVID,In a water that was there
7888,KING DAVID,She wesshe her goodly body bare
7889,KING DAVID,And dried it with her owen hair:
7890,KING DAVID,"Both her arms and her knees fair,"
7891,KING DAVID,Both bosom and brows;
7892,KING DAVID,Both shoulders and eke thighs
7893,KING DAVID,Tho she wesshe upon this wise;
7894,KING DAVID,"Ever she sighed with little sighs,"
7895,KING DAVID,And ever she gave God thank.
7896,KING DAVID,"Yea, God wot I can well see yet"
7897,KING DAVID,Both her breast and her sides all wet
7898,KING DAVID,And her long hair withouten let
7899,KING DAVID,Spread sideways like a drawing net;
7900,KING DAVID,Full dear bought and full far fet
7901,KING DAVID,Was that sweet thing there y-set;
7902,KING DAVID,It were a hard thing to forget
7903,KING DAVID,"How both lips and eyen met,"
7904,KING DAVID,Breast and breath sank.
7905,KING DAVID,"So goodly a sight as there she was,"
7906,KING DAVID,Lying looking on her glass
7907,KING DAVID,"By wan water in green grass,"
7908,KING DAVID,Yet saw never man.
7909,KING DAVID,So soft and great she was and bright
7910,KING DAVID,"With all her body waxen white,"
7911,KING DAVID,I woxe nigh blind to see the light
7912,KING DAVID,Shed out of it to left and right;
7913,KING DAVID,This bitter sin from that sweet sight
7914,KING DAVID,Between us twain began.

7923,NATHAN,I swear by Godis rood.
7924,NATHAN,"Therefore, lord, be merry here,"
7925,NATHAN,"And go to meat withouten fear,"
7926,NATHAN,And hear a mass with goodly cheer;

7935,ST. DOROTHY,ST. DOROTHY
7936,ST. DOROTHY,
7937,ST. DOROTHY,
7938,ST. DOROTHY,It hath been seen and yet it shall be seen
7939,ST. DOROTHY,That out of tender mouths God's praise hath been
7940,ST. DOROTHY,"Made perfect, and with wood and simple string"
7941,ST. DOROTHY,He hath played music sweet as shawm-playing
7942,ST. DOROTHY,To please himself with softness of all sound;
7943,ST. DOROTHY,And no small thing but hath been sometime found
7944,ST. DOROTHY,"Full sweet of use, and no such humbleness"
7945,ST. DOROTHY,But God hath bruised withal the sentences
7946,ST. DOROTHY,And evidence of wise men witnessing;
7947,ST. DOROTHY,No leaf that is so soft a hidden thing
7948,ST. DOROTHY,It never shall get sight of the great sun;
7949,ST. DOROTHY,"The strength of ten has been the strength of one,"
7950,ST. DOROTHY,And lowliness has waxed imperious.
7951,ST. DOROTHY,There was in Rome a man Theophilus
7952,ST. DOROTHY,"Of right great blood and gracious ways, that had"
7953,ST. DOROTHY,All noble fashions to make people glad
7954,ST. DOROTHY,And a soft life of pleasurable days;
7955,ST. DOROTHY,"He was a goodly man for one to praise,"
7956,ST. DOROTHY,Flawless and whole upward from foot to head;
7957,ST. DOROTHY,His arms were a red hawk that alway fed
7958,ST. DOROTHY,"On a small bird with feathers gnawed upon,"
7959,ST. DOROTHY,Beaten and plucked about the bosom-bone
7960,ST. DOROTHY,Whereby a small round fleck like fire there was:
7961,ST. DOROTHY,They called it in their tongue lampadias;
7962,ST. DOROTHY,This was the banner of the lordly man.
7963,ST. DOROTHY,In many straits of sea and reaches wan
7964,ST. DOROTHY,"Full of quick wind, and many a shaken firth,"
7965,ST. DOROTHY,"It had seen fighting days of either earth,"
7966,ST. DOROTHY,Westward or east of waters Gaditane
7967,ST. DOROTHY,(This was the place of sea-rocks under Spain
7968,ST. DOROTHY,Called after the great praise of Hercules)
7969,ST. DOROTHY,"And north beyond the washing Pontic seas,"
7970,ST. DOROTHY,"Far windy Russian places fabulous,"
7971,ST. DOROTHY,And salt fierce tides of storm-swoln Bosphorus.
7972,ST. DOROTHY,Now as this lord came straying in Rome town
7973,ST. DOROTHY,He saw a little lattice open down
7974,ST. DOROTHY,And after it a press of maidens' heads
7975,ST. DOROTHY,That sat upon their cold small quiet beds
7976,ST. DOROTHY,"Talking, and played upon short-stringèd lutes;"
7977,ST. DOROTHY,And other some ground perfume out of roots
7978,ST. DOROTHY,Gathered by marvellous moons in Asia;
7979,ST. DOROTHY,"Saffron and aloes and wild cassia,"
7980,ST. DOROTHY,Coloured all through and smelling of the sun;
7981,ST. DOROTHY,And over all these was a certain one
7982,ST. DOROTHY,"Clothed softly, with sweet herbs about her hair"
7983,ST. DOROTHY,And bosom flowerful; her face more fair
7984,ST. DOROTHY,Than sudden-singing April in soft lands:
7985,ST. DOROTHY,"Eyed like a gracious bird, and in both hands"
7986,ST. DOROTHY,She held a psalter painted green and red.
7987,ST. DOROTHY,"This Theophile laughed at the heart, and said,"
7988,ST. DOROTHY,"Now God so help me hither and St. Paul,"
7989,ST. DOROTHY,As by the new time of their festival
7990,ST. DOROTHY,I have good will to take this maid to wife.
7991,ST. DOROTHY,And herewith fell to fancies of her life
7992,ST. DOROTHY,And soft half-thoughts that ended suddenly.
7993,ST. DOROTHY,"This is man's guise to please himself, when he"
7994,ST. DOROTHY,"Shall not see one thing of his pleasant things,"
7995,ST. DOROTHY,Nor with outwatch of many travailings
7996,ST. DOROTHY,Come to be eased of the least pain he hath
7997,ST. DOROTHY,For all his love and all his foolish wrath
7998,ST. DOROTHY,And all the heavy manner of his mind.
7999,ST. DOROTHY,Thus is he like a fisher fallen blind
8000,ST. DOROTHY,That casts his nets across the boat awry
8001,ST. DOROTHY,"To strike the sea, but lo, he striketh dry"
8002,ST. DOROTHY,And plucks them back all broken for his pain
8003,ST. DOROTHY,And bites his beard and casts across again
8004,ST. DOROTHY,And reaching wrong slips over in the sea.
8005,ST. DOROTHY,"So hath this man a strangled neck for fee,"
8006,ST. DOROTHY,For all his cost he chuckles in his throat.
8007,ST. DOROTHY,This Theophile that little hereof wote
8008,ST. DOROTHY,Laid wait to hear of her what she might be:
8009,ST. DOROTHY,"Men told him she had name of Dorothy,"
8010,ST. DOROTHY,And was a lady of a worthy house.
8011,ST. DOROTHY,Thereat this knight grew inly glorious
8012,ST. DOROTHY,That he should have a love so fair of place.
8013,ST. DOROTHY,"She was a maiden of most quiet face,"
8014,ST. DOROTHY,"Tender of speech, and had no hardihood"
8015,ST. DOROTHY,But was nigh feeble of her fearful blood;
8016,ST. DOROTHY,Her mercy in her was so marvellous
8017,ST. DOROTHY,"From her least years, that seeing her school-fellows"
8018,ST. DOROTHY,"That read beside her stricken with a rod,"
8019,ST. DOROTHY,She would cry sore and say some word to God
8020,ST. DOROTHY,That he would ease her fellow of his pain.
8021,ST. DOROTHY,There is no touch of sun or fallen rain
8022,ST. DOROTHY,That ever fell on a more gracious thing.
8023,ST. DOROTHY,In middle Rome there was in stone-working
8024,ST. DOROTHY,The church of Venus painted royally.
8025,ST. DOROTHY,"The chapels of it were some two or three,"
8026,ST. DOROTHY,In each of them her tabernacle was
8027,ST. DOROTHY,And a wide window of six feet in glass
8028,ST. DOROTHY,Coloured with all her works in red and gold.
8029,ST. DOROTHY,The altars had bright cloths and cups to hold
8030,ST. DOROTHY,"The wine of Venus for the services,"
8031,ST. DOROTHY,Made out of honey and crushed wood-berries
8032,ST. DOROTHY,"That shed sweet yellow through the thick wet red,"
8033,ST. DOROTHY,That on high days was borne upon the head
8034,ST. DOROTHY,Of Venus' priest for any man to drink;
8035,ST. DOROTHY,So that in drinking he should fall to think
8036,ST. DOROTHY,"On some fair face, and in the thought thereof"
8037,ST. DOROTHY,"Worship, and such should triumph in his love."
8038,ST. DOROTHY,For this soft wine that did such grace and good
8039,ST. DOROTHY,"Was new trans-shaped and mixed with Love's own blood,"
8040,ST. DOROTHY,That in the fighting Trojan time was bled;
8041,ST. DOROTHY,For which came such a woe to Diomed
8042,ST. DOROTHY,That he was stifled after in hard sea.
8043,ST. DOROTHY,And some said that this wine-shedding should be
8044,ST. DOROTHY,"Made of the falling of Adonis' blood,"
8045,ST. DOROTHY,That curled upon the thorns and broken wood
8046,ST. DOROTHY,And round the gold silk shoes on Venus' feet;
8047,ST. DOROTHY,The taste thereof was as hot honey sweet
8048,ST. DOROTHY,And in the mouth ran soft and riotous.
8049,ST. DOROTHY,This was the holiness of Venus' house.
8050,ST. DOROTHY,"It was their worship, that in August days"
8051,ST. DOROTHY,Twelve maidens should go through those Roman ways
8052,ST. DOROTHY,"Naked, and having gold across their brows"
8053,ST. DOROTHY,"And their hair twisted in short golden rows,"
8054,ST. DOROTHY,To minister to Venus in this wise:
8055,ST. DOROTHY,And twelve men chosen in their companies
8056,ST. DOROTHY,"To match these maidens by the altar-stair,"
8057,ST. DOROTHY,"All in one habit, crowned upon the hair."
8058,ST. DOROTHY,Among these men was chosen Theophile.
8059,ST. DOROTHY,"This knight went out and prayed a little while,"
8060,ST. DOROTHY,Holding queen Venus by her hands and knees;
8061,ST. DOROTHY,I will give thee twelve royal images
8062,ST. DOROTHY,"Cut in glad gold, with marvels of wrought stone"
8063,ST. DOROTHY,"For thy sweet priests to lean and pray upon,"
8064,ST. DOROTHY,"Jasper and hyacinth and chrysopras,"
8065,ST. DOROTHY,And the strange Asian thalamite that was
8066,ST. DOROTHY,Hidden twelve ages under heavy sea
8067,ST. DOROTHY,"Among the little sleepy pearls, to be"
8068,ST. DOROTHY,A shrine lit over with soft candle-flame
8069,ST. DOROTHY,"Burning all night red as hot brows of shame,"
8070,ST. DOROTHY,So thou wilt be my lady without sin.
8071,ST. DOROTHY,"Goddess that art all gold outside and in,"
8072,ST. DOROTHY,Help me to serve thee in thy holy way.
8073,ST. DOROTHY,"Thou knowest, Love, that in my bearing day"
8074,ST. DOROTHY,There shone a laughter in the singing stars
8075,ST. DOROTHY,Round the gold-ceilèd bride-bed wherein Mars
8076,ST. DOROTHY,Touched thee and had thee in your kissing wise.
8077,ST. DOROTHY,"Now therefore, sweet, kiss thou my maiden's eyes"
8078,ST. DOROTHY,That they may open graciously towards me;
8079,ST. DOROTHY,And this new fashion of thy shrine shall be
8080,ST. DOROTHY,As soft with gold as thine own happy head.
8081,ST. DOROTHY,"The goddess, that was painted with face red"
8082,ST. DOROTHY,"Between two long green tumbled sides of sea,"
8083,ST. DOROTHY,"Stooped her neck sideways, and spake pleasantly:"
8084,ST. DOROTHY,Thou shalt have grace as thou art thrall of mine.
8085,ST. DOROTHY,And with this came a savour of shed wine
8086,ST. DOROTHY,And plucked-out petals from a rose's head:
8087,ST. DOROTHY,"And softly with slow laughs of lip she said,"
8088,ST. DOROTHY,Thou shalt have favour all thy days of me.
8089,ST. DOROTHY,"Then came Theophilus to Dorothy,"
8090,ST. DOROTHY,"Saying: O sweet, if one should strive or speak"
8091,ST. DOROTHY,"Against God's ways, he gets a beaten cheek"
8092,ST. DOROTHY,For all his wage and shame above all men.
8093,ST. DOROTHY,Therefore I have no will to turn again
8094,ST. DOROTHY,"When God saith ""go,"" lest a worse thing fall out."
8095,ST. DOROTHY,"Then she, misdoubting lest he went about"
8096,ST. DOROTHY,"To catch her wits, made answer somewhat thus:"
8097,ST. DOROTHY,"I have no will, my lord Theophilus,"
8098,ST. DOROTHY,To speak against this worthy word of yours;
8099,ST. DOROTHY,"Knowing how God's will in all speech endures,"
8100,ST. DOROTHY,"That save by grace there may no thing be said,"
8101,ST. DOROTHY,"Then Theophile waxed light from foot to head,"
8102,ST. DOROTHY,And softly fell upon this answering.
8103,ST. DOROTHY,It is well seen you are a chosen thing
8104,ST. DOROTHY,To do God service in his gracious way.
8105,ST. DOROTHY,I will that you make haste and holiday
8106,ST. DOROTHY,"To go next year upon the Venus stair,"
8107,ST. DOROTHY,"Covered none else, but crowned upon your hair,"
8108,ST. DOROTHY,And do the service that a maiden doth.
8109,ST. DOROTHY,She said: but I that am Christ's maid were loth
8110,ST. DOROTHY,To do this thing that hath such bitter name.
8111,ST. DOROTHY,Thereat his brows were beaten with sore shame
8112,ST. DOROTHY,And he came off and said no other word.
8113,ST. DOROTHY,"Then his eyes chanced upon his banner-bird,"
8114,ST. DOROTHY,And he fell fingering at the staff of it
8115,ST. DOROTHY,"And laughed for wrath and stared between his feet,"
8116,ST. DOROTHY,And out of a chafed heart he spake as thus:
8117,ST. DOROTHY,"Lo how she japes at me Theophilus,"
8118,ST. DOROTHY,Feigning herself a fool and hard to love;
8119,ST. DOROTHY,Yet in good time for all she boasteth of
8120,ST. DOROTHY,She shall be like a little beaten bird.
8121,ST. DOROTHY,And while his mouth was open in that word
8122,ST. DOROTHY,"He came upon the house Janiculum,"
8123,ST. DOROTHY,"Where some went busily, and other some"
8124,ST. DOROTHY,Talked in the gate called the gate glorious.
8125,ST. DOROTHY,"The emperor, which was one Gabalus,"
8126,ST. DOROTHY,Sat over all and drank chill wine alone.
8127,ST. DOROTHY,"To whom is come Theophilus anon,"
8128,ST. DOROTHY,"And said as thus: _Beau sire, Dieu vous aide_."
8129,ST. DOROTHY,"And afterward sat under him, and said"
8130,ST. DOROTHY,All this thing through as ye have wholly heard.
8131,ST. DOROTHY,This Gabalus laughed thickly in his beard.
8132,ST. DOROTHY,"Yea, this is righteousness and maiden rule."
8133,ST. DOROTHY,"Truly, he said, a maid is but a fool."
8134,ST. DOROTHY,"And japed at them as one full villainous,"
8135,ST. DOROTHY,"In a lewd wise, this heathen Gabalus,"
8136,ST. DOROTHY,And sent his men to bind her as he bade.
8137,ST. DOROTHY,"Thus have they taken Dorothy the maid,"
8138,ST. DOROTHY,And haled her forth as men hale pick-purses:
8139,ST. DOROTHY,"A little need God knows they had of this,"
8140,ST. DOROTHY,To hale her by her maiden gentle hair.
8141,ST. DOROTHY,"Thus went she lowly, making a soft prayer,"
8142,ST. DOROTHY,"As one who stays the sweet wine in his mouth,"
8143,ST. DOROTHY,"Murmuring with eased lips, and is most loth"
8144,ST. DOROTHY,To have done wholly with the sweet of it.
8145,ST. DOROTHY,"Christ king, fair Christ, that knowest all men's wit"
8146,ST. DOROTHY,"And all the feeble fashion of my ways,"
8147,ST. DOROTHY,"O perfect God, that from all yesterdays"
8148,ST. DOROTHY,"Abidest whole with morrows perfected,"
8149,ST. DOROTHY,I pray thee by thy mother's holy head
8150,ST. DOROTHY,"Thou help me to do right, that I not slip:"
8151,ST. DOROTHY,"I have no speech nor strength upon my lip,"
8152,ST. DOROTHY,Except thou help me who art wise and sweet.
8153,ST. DOROTHY,"Do this too for those nails that clove thy feet,"
8154,ST. DOROTHY,Let me die maiden after many pains.
8155,ST. DOROTHY,"Though I be least among thy handmaidens,"
8156,ST. DOROTHY,Doubtless I shall take death more sweetly thus.
8157,ST. DOROTHY,"Now have they brought her to King Gabalus,"
8158,ST. DOROTHY,Who laughed in all his throat some breathing-whiles:
8159,ST. DOROTHY,"By God, he said, if one should leap two miles,"
8160,ST. DOROTHY,He were not pained about the sides so much.
8161,ST. DOROTHY,This were a soft thing for a man to touch.
8162,ST. DOROTHY,Shall one so chafe that hath such little bones?
8163,ST. DOROTHY,And shook his throat with thick and chuckled moans
8164,ST. DOROTHY,For laughter that she had such holiness.
8165,ST. DOROTHY,"What aileth thee, wilt thou do services?"
8166,ST. DOROTHY,It were good fare to fare as Venus doth.
8167,ST. DOROTHY,"Then said this lady with her maiden mouth,"
8168,ST. DOROTHY,"Shamefaced, and something paler in the cheek:"
8169,ST. DOROTHY,"Now, sir, albeit my wit and will to speak"
8170,ST. DOROTHY,"Give me no grace in sight of worthy men,"
8171,ST. DOROTHY,"For all my shame yet know I this again,"
8172,ST. DOROTHY,"I may not speak, nor after downlying"
8173,ST. DOROTHY,"Rise up to take delight in lute-playing,"
8174,ST. DOROTHY,"Nor sing nor sleep, nor sit and fold my hands,"
8175,ST. DOROTHY,But my soul in some measure understands
8176,ST. DOROTHY,God's grace laid like a garment over me.
8177,ST. DOROTHY,For this fair God that out of strong sharp sea
8178,ST. DOROTHY,"Lifted the shapely and green-coloured land,"
8179,ST. DOROTHY,And hath the weight of heaven in his hand
8180,ST. DOROTHY,"As one might hold a bird, and under him"
8181,ST. DOROTHY,The heavy golden planets beam by beam
8182,ST. DOROTHY,"Building the feasting-chambers of his house,"
8183,ST. DOROTHY,"And the large world he holdeth with his brows,"
8184,ST. DOROTHY,And with the light of them astonisheth
8185,ST. DOROTHY,All place and time and face of life and death
8186,ST. DOROTHY,"And motion of the north wind and the south,"
8187,ST. DOROTHY,And is the sound within his angel's mouth
8188,ST. DOROTHY,"Of singing words and words of thanksgiving,"
8189,ST. DOROTHY,And is the colour of the latter spring
8190,ST. DOROTHY,"And heat upon the summer and the sun,"
8191,ST. DOROTHY,And is beginning of all things begun
8192,ST. DOROTHY,"And gathers in him all things to their end,"
8193,ST. DOROTHY,And with the fingers of his hand doth bend
8194,ST. DOROTHY,"The stretched-out sides of heaven like a sail,"
8195,ST. DOROTHY,And with his breath he maketh the red pale
8196,ST. DOROTHY,"And fills with blood faint faces of men dead,"
8197,ST. DOROTHY,And with the sound between his lips are fed
8198,ST. DOROTHY,"Iron and fire and the white body of snow,"
8199,ST. DOROTHY,"And blossom of all trees in places low,"
8200,ST. DOROTHY,"And small bright herbs about the little hills,"
8201,ST. DOROTHY,"And fruit pricked softly with birds' tender bills,"
8202,ST. DOROTHY,"And flight of foam about green fields of sea,"
8203,ST. DOROTHY,And fourfold strength of the great winds that be
8204,ST. DOROTHY,"Moved always outward from beneath his feet,"
8205,ST. DOROTHY,And growth of grass and growth of sheavèd wheat
8206,ST. DOROTHY,And all green flower of goodly-growing lands;
8207,ST. DOROTHY,And all these things he gathers with his hands
8208,ST. DOROTHY,And covers all their beauty with his wings;
8209,ST. DOROTHY,"The same, even God that governs all these things,"
8210,ST. DOROTHY,Hath set my feet to be upon his ways.
8211,ST. DOROTHY,Now therefore for no painfulness of days
8212,ST. DOROTHY,I shall put off this service bound on me.
8213,ST. DOROTHY,"Also, fair sir, ye know this certainly,"
8214,ST. DOROTHY,How God was in his flesh full chaste and meek
8215,ST. DOROTHY,"And gave his face to shame, and either cheek"
8216,ST. DOROTHY,Gave up to smiting of men tyrannous.
8217,ST. DOROTHY,And here with a great voice this Gabalus
8218,ST. DOROTHY,"Cried out and said: By God's blood and his bones,"
8219,ST. DOROTHY,This were good game betwixen night and nones
8220,ST. DOROTHY,For one to sit and hearken to such saws:
8221,ST. DOROTHY,I were as lief fall in some big beast's jaws
8222,ST. DOROTHY,As hear these women's jaw-teeth clattering;
8223,ST. DOROTHY,"By God a woman is the harder thing,"
8224,ST. DOROTHY,One may not put a hook into her mouth.
8225,ST. DOROTHY,Now by St. Luke I am so sore adrouth
8226,ST. DOROTHY,For all these saws I must needs drink again.
8227,ST. DOROTHY,But I pray God deliver all us men
8228,ST. DOROTHY,From all such noise of women and their heat.
8229,ST. DOROTHY,"That is a noble scripture, well I weet,"
8230,ST. DOROTHY,That likens women to an empty can;
8231,ST. DOROTHY,"When God said that he was a full wise man,"
8232,ST. DOROTHY,I trow no man may blame him as for that.
8233,ST. DOROTHY,"And herewithal he drank a draught, and spat,"
8234,ST. DOROTHY,And said: Now shall I make an end hereof.
8235,ST. DOROTHY,"Come near all men and hearken for God's love,"
8236,ST. DOROTHY,"And ye shall hear a jest or twain, God wot."
8237,ST. DOROTHY,And spake as thus with mouth full thick and hot;
8238,ST. DOROTHY,But thou do this thou shalt be shortly slain.
8239,ST. DOROTHY,"Lo, sir, she said, this death and all this pain"
8240,ST. DOROTHY,I take in penance of my bitter sins.
8241,ST. DOROTHY,"Yea now, quoth Gabalus, this game begins."
8242,ST. DOROTHY,"Lo, without sin one shall not live a span."
8243,ST. DOROTHY,"Lo, this is she that would not look on man"
8244,ST. DOROTHY,Between her fingers folded in thwart wise.
8245,ST. DOROTHY,See how her shame hath smitten in her eyes
8246,ST. DOROTHY,That was so clean she had not heard of shame.
8247,ST. DOROTHY,"Certes, he said, by Gabalus my name,"
8248,ST. DOROTHY,This two years back I was not so well pleased.
8249,ST. DOROTHY,This were good mirth for sick men to be eased
8250,ST. DOROTHY,And rise up whole and laugh at hearing of.
8251,ST. DOROTHY,"I pray thee show us something of thy love,"
8252,ST. DOROTHY,Since thou wast maid thy gown is waxen wide.
8253,ST. DOROTHY,"Yea, maid I am, she said, and somewhat sighed,"
8254,ST. DOROTHY,As one who thought upon the low fair house
8255,ST. DOROTHY,"Where she sat working, with soft bended brows"
8256,ST. DOROTHY,"Watching her threads, among the school-maidens."
8257,ST. DOROTHY,And she thought well now God had brought her thence
8258,ST. DOROTHY,She should not come to sew her gold again.
8259,ST. DOROTHY,Then cried King Gabalus upon his men
8260,ST. DOROTHY,To have her forth and draw her with steel gins.
8261,ST. DOROTHY,And as a man hag-ridden beats and grins
8262,ST. DOROTHY,"And bends his body sidelong in his bed,"
8263,ST. DOROTHY,"So wagged he with his body and knave's head,"
8264,ST. DOROTHY,"Gaping at her, and blowing with his breath."
8265,ST. DOROTHY,And in good time he gat an evil death
8266,ST. DOROTHY,Out of his lewdness with his cursèd wives:
8267,ST. DOROTHY,His bones were hewn asunder as with knives
8268,ST. DOROTHY,"For his misliving, certes it is said."
8269,ST. DOROTHY,"But all the evil wrought upon this maid,"
8270,ST. DOROTHY,It were full hard for one to handle it.
8271,ST. DOROTHY,"For her soft blood was shed upon her feet,"
8272,ST. DOROTHY,And all her body's colour bruised and faint.
8273,ST. DOROTHY,"But she, as one abiding God's great saint,"
8274,ST. DOROTHY,Spake not nor wept for all this travail hard.
8275,ST. DOROTHY,Wherefore the king commanded afterward
8276,ST. DOROTHY,To slay her presently in all men's sight.
8277,ST. DOROTHY,And it was now an hour upon the night
8278,ST. DOROTHY,"And winter-time, and a few stars began."
8279,ST. DOROTHY,The weather was yet feeble and all wan
8280,ST. DOROTHY,For beating of a weighty wind and snow.
8281,ST. DOROTHY,"And she came walking in soft wise and slow,"
8282,ST. DOROTHY,And many men with faces piteous.
8283,ST. DOROTHY,"Then came this heavy cursing Gabalus,"
8284,ST. DOROTHY,That swore full hard into his drunken beard;
8285,ST. DOROTHY,And faintly after without any word
8286,ST. DOROTHY,Came Theophile some paces off the king.
8287,ST. DOROTHY,And in the middle of this wayfaring
8288,ST. DOROTHY,Full tenderly beholding her he said:
8289,ST. DOROTHY,There is no word of comfort with men dead
8290,ST. DOROTHY,Nor any face and colour of things sweet;
8291,ST. DOROTHY,But always with lean cheeks and lifted feet
8292,ST. DOROTHY,These dead men lie all aching to the blood
8293,ST. DOROTHY,"With bitter cold, their brows withouten hood"
8294,ST. DOROTHY,"Beating for chill, their bodies swathed full thin:"
8295,ST. DOROTHY,"Alas, what hire shall any have herein"
8296,ST. DOROTHY,To give his life and get such bitterness?
8297,ST. DOROTHY,Also the soul going forth bodiless
8298,ST. DOROTHY,"Is hurt with naked cold, and no man saith"
8299,ST. DOROTHY,If there be house or covering for death
8300,ST. DOROTHY,To hide the soul that is discomforted.
8301,ST. DOROTHY,Then she beholding him a little said:
8302,ST. DOROTHY,"Alas, fair lord, ye have no wit of this;"
8303,ST. DOROTHY,For on one side death is full poor of bliss
8304,ST. DOROTHY,And as ye say full sharp of bone and lean:
8305,ST. DOROTHY,But on the other side is good and green
8306,ST. DOROTHY,And hath soft flower of tender-coloured hair
8307,ST. DOROTHY,"Grown on his head, and a red mouth as fair"
8308,ST. DOROTHY,As may be kissed with lips; thereto his face
8309,ST. DOROTHY,"Is as God's face, and in a perfect place"
8310,ST. DOROTHY,Full of all sun and colour of straight boughs
8311,ST. DOROTHY,And waterheads about a painted house
8312,ST. DOROTHY,That hath a mile of flowers either way
8313,ST. DOROTHY,"Outward from it, and blossom-grass of May"
8314,ST. DOROTHY,"Thickening on many a side for length of heat,"
8315,ST. DOROTHY,Hath God set death upon a noble seat
8316,ST. DOROTHY,"Covered with green and flowered in the fold,"
8317,ST. DOROTHY,In likeness of a great king grown full old
8318,ST. DOROTHY,And gentle with new temperance of blood;
8319,ST. DOROTHY,"And on his brows a purfled purple hood,"
8320,ST. DOROTHY,They may not carry any golden thing;
8321,ST. DOROTHY,And plays some tune with subtle fingering
8322,ST. DOROTHY,"On a small cithern, full of tears and sleep"
8323,ST. DOROTHY,And heavy pleasure that is quick to weep
8324,ST. DOROTHY,And sorrow with the honey in her mouth;
8325,ST. DOROTHY,And for this might of music that he doth
8326,ST. DOROTHY,Are all souls drawn toward him with great love
8327,ST. DOROTHY,And weep for sweetness of the noise thereof
8328,ST. DOROTHY,And bow to him with worship of their knees;
8329,ST. DOROTHY,And all the field is thick with companies
8330,ST. DOROTHY,Of fair-clothed men that play on shawms and lutes
8331,ST. DOROTHY,And gather honey of the yellow fruits
8332,ST. DOROTHY,Between the branches waxen soft and wide:
8333,ST. DOROTHY,And all this peace endures in either side
8334,ST. DOROTHY,"Of the green land, and God beholdeth all."
8335,ST. DOROTHY,And this is girdled with a round fair wall
8336,ST. DOROTHY,Made of red stone and cool with heavy leaves
8337,ST. DOROTHY,"Grown out against it, and green blossom cleaves"
8338,ST. DOROTHY,"To the green chinks, and lesser wall-weed sweet,"
8339,ST. DOROTHY,"Kissing the crannies that are split with heat,"
8340,ST. DOROTHY,And branches where the summer draws to head.
8341,ST. DOROTHY,"And Theophile burnt in the cheek, and said:"
8342,ST. DOROTHY,"Yea, could one see it, this were marvellous."
8343,ST. DOROTHY,"I pray you, at your coming to this house,"
8344,ST. DOROTHY,Give me some leaf of all those tree-branches;
8345,ST. DOROTHY,"Seeing how so sharp and white our weather is,"
8346,ST. DOROTHY,There is no green nor gracious red to see.
8347,ST. DOROTHY,"Yea, sir, she said, that shall I certainly."
8348,ST. DOROTHY,And from her long sweet throat without a fleck
8349,ST. DOROTHY,"Undid the gold, and through her stretched-out neck"
8350,ST. DOROTHY,"The cold axe clove, and smote away her head:"
8351,ST. DOROTHY,Out of her throat the tender blood full red
8352,ST. DOROTHY,Fell suddenly through all her long soft hair.
8353,ST. DOROTHY,And with good speed for hardness of the air
8354,ST. DOROTHY,Each man departed to his house again.
8355,ST. DOROTHY,"Lo, as fair colour in the face of men"
8356,ST. DOROTHY,"At seed-time of their blood, or in such wise"
8357,ST. DOROTHY,"As a thing seen increaseth in men's eyes,"
8358,ST. DOROTHY,"Caught first far off by sickly fits of sight,"
8359,ST. DOROTHY,"So a word said, if one shall hear aright,"
8360,ST. DOROTHY,Abides against the season of its growth.
8361,ST. DOROTHY,"This Theophile went slowly, as one doth"
8362,ST. DOROTHY,That is not sure for sickness of his feet;
8363,ST. DOROTHY,"And counting the white stonework of the street,"
8364,ST. DOROTHY,"Tears fell out of his eyes for wrath and love,"
8365,ST. DOROTHY,Making him weep more for the shame thereof
8366,ST. DOROTHY,Than for true pain: so went he half a mile.
8367,ST. DOROTHY,"And women mocked him, saying: Theophile,"
8368,ST. DOROTHY,"Lo, she is dead; what shall a woman have"
8369,ST. DOROTHY,"That loveth such an one? so Christ me save,"
8370,ST. DOROTHY,I were as lief to love a man new-hung.
8371,ST. DOROTHY,"Surely this man has bitten on his tongue,"
8372,ST. DOROTHY,This makes him sad and writhled in his face.
8373,ST. DOROTHY,And when they came upon the paven place
8374,ST. DOROTHY,That was called sometime the place amorous
8375,ST. DOROTHY,There came a child before Theophilus
8376,ST. DOROTHY,"Bearing a basket, and said suddenly:"
8377,ST. DOROTHY,"Fair sir, this is my mistress Dorothy"
8378,ST. DOROTHY,That sends you gifts; and with this he was gone.
8379,ST. DOROTHY,In all this earth there is not such an one
8380,ST. DOROTHY,For colour and straight stature made so fair.
8381,ST. DOROTHY,The tender growing gold of his pure hair
8382,ST. DOROTHY,"Was as wheat growing, and his mouth as flame."
8383,ST. DOROTHY,God called him Holy after his own name;
8384,ST. DOROTHY,With gold cloth like fire burning he was clad.
8385,ST. DOROTHY,"But for the fair green basket that he had,"
8386,ST. DOROTHY,It was filled up with heavy white and red;
8387,ST. DOROTHY,"Great roses stained still where the first rose bled,"
8388,ST. DOROTHY,Burning at heart for shame their heart withholds:
8389,ST. DOROTHY,And the sad colour of strong marigolds
8390,ST. DOROTHY,That have the sun to kiss their lips for love;
8391,ST. DOROTHY,"The flower that Venus' hair is woven of,"
8392,ST. DOROTHY,"The colour of fair apples in the sun,"
8393,ST. DOROTHY,Late peaches gathered when the heat was done
8394,ST. DOROTHY,And the slain air got breath; and after these
8395,ST. DOROTHY,"The fair faint-headed poppies drunk with ease,"
8396,ST. DOROTHY,And heaviness of hollow lilies red.
8397,ST. DOROTHY,"Then cried they all that saw these things, and said"
8398,ST. DOROTHY,"It was God's doing, and was marvellous."
8399,ST. DOROTHY,And in brief while this knight Theophilus
8400,ST. DOROTHY,"Is waxen full of faith, and witnesseth"
8401,ST. DOROTHY,"Before the king of God and love and death,"
8402,ST. DOROTHY,For which the king bade hang him presently.
8403,ST. DOROTHY,A gallows of a goodly piece of tree
8404,ST. DOROTHY,This Gabalus hath made to hang him on.
8405,ST. DOROTHY,Forth of this world lo Theophile is gone
8406,ST. DOROTHY,"With a wried neck, God give us better fare"
8407,ST. DOROTHY,Than his that hath a twisted throat to wear;
8408,ST. DOROTHY,But truly for his love God hath him brought
8409,ST. DOROTHY,There where his heavy body grieves him nought
8410,ST. DOROTHY,Nor all the people plucking at his feet;
8411,ST. DOROTHY,"But in his face his lady's face is sweet,"
8412,ST. DOROTHY,And through his lips her kissing lips are gone:
8413,ST. DOROTHY,"God send him peace, and joy of such an one."
8414,ST. DOROTHY,This is the story of St. Dorothy.
8415,ST. DOROTHY,I will you of your mercy pray for me
8416,ST. DOROTHY,"Because I wrote these sayings for your grace,"
8417,ST. DOROTHY,That I may one day see her in the face.
8418,ST. DOROTHY,

8422,THE TWO DREAMS,THE TWO DREAMS
8423,THE TWO DREAMS,
8424,(FROM BOCCACCIO),(FROM BOCCACCIO)
8425,(FROM BOCCACCIO),
8426,(FROM BOCCACCIO),
8427,(FROM BOCCACCIO),I will that if I say a heavy thing
8428,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Your tongues forgive me; seeing ye know that spring
8429,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Has flecks and fits of pain to keep her sweet,"
8430,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And walks somewhile with winter-bitten feet.
8431,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Moreover it sounds often well to let
8432,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"One string, when ye play music, keep at fret"
8433,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The whole song through; one petal that is dead
8434,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Confirms the roses, be they white or red;"
8435,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Dead sorrow is not sorrowful to hear
8436,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As the thick noise that breaks mid weeping were;
8437,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The sick sound aching in a lifted throat
8438,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Turns to sharp silver of a perfect note;
8439,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And though the rain falls often, and with rain"
8440,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Late autumn falls on the old red leaves like pain,"
8441,(FROM BOCCACCIO),I deem that God is not disquieted.
8442,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Also while men are fed with wine and bread,"
8443,(FROM BOCCACCIO),They shall be fed with sorrow at his hand.
8444,(FROM BOCCACCIO),There grew a rose-garden in Florence land
8445,(FROM BOCCACCIO),More fair than many; all red summers through
8446,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The leaves smelt sweet and sharp of rain, and blew"
8447,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Sideways with tender wind; and therein fell
8448,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Sweet sound wherewith the green waxed audible,"
8449,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As a bird's will to sing disturbed his throat
8450,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And set the sharp wings forward like a boat
8451,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Pushed through soft water, moving his brown side"
8452,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Smooth-shapen as a maid's, and shook with pride"
8453,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"His deep warm bosom, till the heavy sun's"
8454,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Set face of heat stopped all the songs at once.
8455,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The ways were clean to walk and delicate;
8456,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And when the windy white of March grew late,"
8457,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Before the trees took heart to face the sun
8458,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"With ravelled raiment of lean winter on,"
8459,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The roots were thick and hot with hollow grass.
8460,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Some roods away a lordly house there was,"
8461,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Cool with broad courts and latticed passage wet
8462,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"From rush-flowers and lilies ripe to set,"
8463,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Sown close among the strewings of the floor;
8464,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And either wall of the slow corridor
8465,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Was dim with deep device of gracious things;
8466,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Some angel's steady mouth and weight of wings
8467,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Shut to the side; or Peter with straight stole
8468,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And beard cut black against the aureole
8469,(FROM BOCCACCIO),That spanned his head from nape to crown; thereby
8470,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Mary's gold hair, thick to the girdle-tie"
8471,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Wherein was bound a child with tender feet;
8472,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Or the broad cross with blood nigh brown on it.
8473,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Within this house a righteous lord abode,"
8474,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Ser Averardo; patient of his mood,"
8475,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And just of judgment; and to child he had
8476,(FROM BOCCACCIO),A maid so sweet that her mere sight made glad
8477,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Men sorrowing, and unbound the brows of hate;"
8478,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And where she came, the lips that pain made strait"
8479,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Waxed warm and wide, and from untender grew"
8480,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Tender as those that sleep brings patience to.
8481,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Such long locks had she, that with knee to chin"
8482,(FROM BOCCACCIO),She might have wrapped and warmed her feet therein.
8483,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Right seldom fell her face on weeping wise;
8484,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Gold hair she had, and golden-coloured eyes,"
8485,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Filled with clear light and fire and large repose
8486,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Like a fair hound's; no man there is but knows
8487,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Her face was white, and thereto she was tall;"
8488,(FROM BOCCACCIO),In no wise lacked there any praise at all
8489,(FROM BOCCACCIO),To her most perfect and pure maidenhood;
8490,(FROM BOCCACCIO),No sin I think there was in all her blood.
8491,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"She, where a gold grate shut the roses in,"
8492,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Dwelt daily through deep summer weeks, through green"
8493,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Flushed hours of rain upon the leaves; and there
8494,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Love made him room and space to worship her
8495,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"With tender worship of bowed knees, and wrought"
8496,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Such pleasure as the pained sense palates not
8497,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"For weariness, but at one taste undoes"
8498,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The heart of its strong sweet, is ravenous"
8499,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Of all the hidden honey; words and sense
8500,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Fail through the tune's imperious prevalence.
8501,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"In a poor house this lover kept apart,"
8502,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Long communing with patience next his heart
8503,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"If love of his might move that face at all,"
8504,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Tuned evenwise with colours musical;
8505,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Then after length of days he said thus: ""Love,"
8506,(FROM BOCCACCIO),For love's own sake and for the love thereof
8507,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Let no harsh words untune your gracious mood;
8508,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"For good it were, if anything be good,"
8509,(FROM BOCCACCIO),To comfort me in this pain's plague of mine;
8510,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Seeing thus, how neither sleep nor bread nor wine"
8511,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Seems pleasant to me, yea no thing that is"
8512,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Seems pleasant to me; only I know this,"
8513,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Love's ways are sharp for palms of piteous feet
8514,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"To travel, but the end of such is sweet:"
8515,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Now do with me as seemeth you the best."""
8516,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"She mused a little, as one holds his guest"
8517,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"By the hand musing, with her face borne down:"
8518,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Then said: ""Yea, though such bitter seed be sown,"
8519,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Have no more care of all that you have said;
8520,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Since if there is no sleep will bind your head,"
8521,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Lo, I am fain to help you certainly;"
8522,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Christ knoweth, sir, if I would have you die;"
8523,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"There is no pleasure when a man is dead."""
8524,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Thereat he kissed her hands and yellow head
8525,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And clipped her fair long body many times;
8526,(FROM BOCCACCIO),I have no wit to shape in written rhymes
8527,(FROM BOCCACCIO),A scanted tithe of this great joy they had.
8528,(FROM BOCCACCIO),They were too near love's secret to be glad;
8529,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As whoso deems the core will surely melt
8530,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"From the warm fruit his lips caress, hath felt"
8531,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Some bitter kernel where the teeth shut hard:
8532,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Or as sweet music sharpens afterward,"
8533,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Being half disrelished both for sharp and sweet;
8534,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"As sea-water, having killed over-heat"
8535,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"In a man's body, chills it with faint ache;"
8536,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"So their sense, burdened only for love's sake,"
8537,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Failed for pure love; yet so time served their wit,"
8538,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"They saved each day some gold reserves of it,"
8539,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Being wiser in love's riddle than such be
8540,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Whom fragments feed with his chance charity.
8541,(FROM BOCCACCIO),All things felt sweet were felt sweet overmuch;
8542,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The rose-thorn's prickle dangerous to touch,"
8543,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And flecks of fire in the thin leaf-shadows;
8544,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Too keen the breathed honey of the rose,"
8545,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Its red too harsh a weight on feasted eyes;
8546,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"They were so far gone in love's histories,"
8547,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Beyond all shape and colour and mere breath,"
8548,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Where pleasure has for kinsfolk sleep and death,"
8549,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And strength of soul and body waxen blind
8550,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"For weariness, and flesh entailed with mind,"
8551,(FROM BOCCACCIO),When the keen edge of sense foretasteth sin.
8552,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Even this green place the summer caught them in
8553,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Seemed half deflowered and sick with beaten leaves
8554,(FROM BOCCACCIO),In their strayed eyes; these gold flower-fumèd eves
8555,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Burnt out to make the sun's love-offering,"
8556,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The midnoon's prayer, the rose's thanksgiving,"
8557,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The trees' weight burdening the strengthless air,"
8558,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The shape of her stilled eyes, her coloured hair,"
8559,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Her body's balance from the moving feet--
8560,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"All this, found fair, lacked yet one grain of sweet"
8561,(FROM BOCCACCIO),It had some warm weeks back: so perisheth
8562,(FROM BOCCACCIO),On May's new lip the tender April breath:
8563,(FROM BOCCACCIO),So those same walks the wind sowed lilies in
8564,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"All April through, and all their latter kin"
8565,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Of languid leaves whereon the Autumn blows--
8566,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The dead red raiment of the last year's rose--
8567,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The last year's laurel, and the last year's love,"
8568,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Fade, and grow things that death grows weary of."
8569,(FROM BOCCACCIO),What man will gather in red summer-time
8570,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The fruit of some obscure and hoary rhyme
8571,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Heard last midwinter, taste the heart in it,"
8572,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Mould the smooth semitones afresh, refit"
8573,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The fair limbs ruined, flush the dead blood through"
8574,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"With colour, make all broken beauties new"
8575,(FROM BOCCACCIO),For love's new lesson--shall not such find pain
8576,(FROM BOCCACCIO),When the marred music labouring in his brain
8577,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Frets him with sweet sharp fragments, and lets slip"
8578,(FROM BOCCACCIO),One word that might leave satisfied his lip--
8579,(FROM BOCCACCIO),One touch that might put fire in all the chords?
8580,(FROM BOCCACCIO),This was her pain: to miss from all sweet words
8581,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Some taste of sound, diverse and delicate--"
8582,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Some speech the old love found out to compensate
8583,(FROM BOCCACCIO),For seasons of shut lips and drowsiness--
8584,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Some grace, some word the old love found out to bless"
8585,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Passionless months and undelighted weeks.
8586,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The flowers had lost their summer-scented cheeks,"
8587,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Their lips were no more sweet than daily breath:
8588,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The year was plagued with instances of death.
8589,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"So fell it, these were sitting in cool grass"
8590,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"With leaves about, and many a bird there was"
8591,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Where the green shadow thickliest impleached
8592,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Soft fruit and writhen spray and blossom bleached
8593,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Dry in the sun or washed with rains to white:
8594,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Her girdle was pure silk, the bosom bright"
8595,(FROM BOCCACCIO),With purple as purple water and gold wrought in.
8596,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"One branch had touched with dusk her lips and chin,"
8597,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Made violet of the throat, abashed with shade"
8598,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The breast's bright plaited work: but nothing frayed
8599,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The sun's large kiss on the luxurious hair.
8600,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Her beauty was new colour to the air
8601,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And music to the silent many birds.
8602,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Love was an-hungred for some perfect words
8603,(FROM BOCCACCIO),To praise her with; but only her low name
8604,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"""Andrevuola"" came thrice, and thrice put shame"
8605,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"In her clear cheek, so fruitful with new red"
8606,(FROM BOCCACCIO),That for pure love straightway shame's self was dead.
8607,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Then with lids gathered as who late had wept
8608,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"She began saying: ""I have so little slept"
8609,(FROM BOCCACCIO),My lids drowse now against the very sun;
8610,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Yea, the brain aching with a dream begun"
8611,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Beats like a fitful blood; kiss but both brows,"
8612,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And you shall pluck my thoughts grown dangerous
8613,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Almost away."" He said thus, kissing them:"
8614,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"""O sole sweet thing that God is glad to name,"
8615,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"My one gold gift, if dreams be sharp and sore"
8616,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Shall not the waking time increase much more
8617,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"With taste and sound, sweet eyesight or sweet scent?"
8618,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Has any heat too hard and insolent
8619,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Burnt bare the tender married leaves, undone"
8620,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The maiden grass shut under from the sun?
8621,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Where in this world is room enough for pain?"""
8622,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The feverish finger of love had touched again
8623,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Her lips with happier blood; the pain lay meek
8624,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"In her fair face, nor altered lip nor cheek"
8625,(FROM BOCCACCIO),With pallor or with pulse; but in her mouth
8626,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Love thirsted as a man wayfaring doth,"
8627,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Making it humble as weak hunger is.
8628,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"She lay close to him, bade do this and this,"
8629,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Say that, sing thus: then almost weeping-ripe"
8630,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Crouched, then laughed low. As one that fain would wipe"
8631,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The old record out of old things done and dead,"
8632,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"She rose, she heaved her hands up, and waxed red"
8633,(FROM BOCCACCIO),For wilful heart and blameless fear of blame;
8634,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Saying ""Though my wits be weak, this is no shame"
8635,(FROM BOCCACCIO),For a poor maid whom love so punisheth
8636,(FROM BOCCACCIO),With heats of hesitation and stopped breath
8637,(FROM BOCCACCIO),That with my dreams I live yet heavily
8638,(FROM BOCCACCIO),For pure sad heart and faith's humility.
8639,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Now be not wroth and I will show you this.
8640,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"""Methought our lips upon their second kiss"
8641,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Met in this place, and a fair day we had"
8642,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And fair soft leaves that waxed and were not sad
8643,(FROM BOCCACCIO),With shaken rain or bitten through with drouth;
8644,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"When I, beholding ever how your mouth"
8645,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Waited for mine, the throat being fallen back,"
8646,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Saw crawl thereout a live thing flaked with black
8647,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Specks of brute slime and leper-coloured scale,"
8648,(FROM BOCCACCIO),A devil's hide with foul flame-writhen grail
8649,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Fashioned where hell's heat festers loathsomest;
8650,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And that brief speech may ease me of the rest,"
8651,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Thus were you slain and eaten of the thing.
8652,(FROM BOCCACCIO),My waked eyes felt the new day shuddering
8653,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"On their low lids, felt the whole east so beat,"
8654,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Pant with close pulse of such a plague-struck heat,"
8655,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As if the palpitating dawn drew breath
8656,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"For horror, breathing between life and death,"
8657,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Till the sun sprang blood-bright and violent."""
8658,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"So finishing, her soft strength wholly spent,"
8659,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"She gazed each way, lest some brute-hoovèd thing,"
8660,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The timeless travail of hell's childbearing,"
8661,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Should threat upon the sudden: whereat he,"
8662,(FROM BOCCACCIO),For relish of her tasted misery
8663,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And tender little thornprick of her pain,"
8664,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Laughed with mere love. What lover among men
8665,(FROM BOCCACCIO),But hath his sense fed sovereignly 'twixt whiles
8666,(FROM BOCCACCIO),With tears and covered eyelids and sick smiles
8667,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And soft disaster of a painèd face?
8668,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"What pain, established in so sweet a place,"
8669,(FROM BOCCACCIO),But the plucked leaf of it smells fragrantly?
8670,(FROM BOCCACCIO),What colour burning man's wide-open eye
8671,(FROM BOCCACCIO),But may be pleasurably seen? what sense
8672,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Keeps in its hot sharp extreme violence
8673,(FROM BOCCACCIO),No savour of sweet things? The bereaved blood
8674,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And emptied flesh in their most broken mood
8675,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Fail not so wholly, famish not when thus"
8676,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Past honey keeps the starved lip covetous.
8677,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Therefore this speech from a glad mouth began,"
8678,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Breathed in her tender hair and temples wan
8679,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Like one prolonged kiss while the lips had breath.
8680,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"""Sleep, that abides in vassalage of death"
8681,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And in death's service wears out half his age,"
8682,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Hath his dreams full of deadly vassalage,"
8683,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Shadow and sound of things ungracious;
8684,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Fair shallow faces, hooded bloodless brows,"
8685,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And mouths past kissing; yea, myself have had"
8686,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As harsh a dream as holds your eyelids sad.
8687,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"""This dream I tell you came three nights ago;"
8688,(FROM BOCCACCIO),In full mid sleep I took a whim to know
8689,(FROM BOCCACCIO),How sweet things might be; so I turned and thought;
8690,(FROM BOCCACCIO),But save my dream all sweet availed me not.
8691,(FROM BOCCACCIO),First came a smell of pounded spice and scent
8692,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Such as God ripens in some continent
8693,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Of utmost amber in the Syrian sea;
8694,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And breaths as though some costly rose could be
8695,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Spoiled slowly, wasted by some bitter fire"
8696,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"To burn the sweet out leaf by leaf, and tire"
8697,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The flower's poor heart with heat and waste, to make"
8698,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Strong magic for some perfumed woman's sake.
8699,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Then a cool naked sense beneath my feet
8700,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Of bud and blossom; and sound of veins that beat
8701,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As if a lute should play of its own heart
8702,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And fearfully, not smitten of either part;"
8703,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And all my blood it filled with sharp and sweet
8704,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As gold swoln grain fills out the huskèd wheat;
8705,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"So I rose naked from the bed, and stood"
8706,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Counting the mobile measure in my blood
8707,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Some pleasant while, and through each limb there came"
8708,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Swift little pleasures pungent as a flame,"
8709,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Felt in the thrilling flesh and veins as much
8710,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As the outer curls that feel the comb's first touch
8711,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Thrill to the roots and shiver as from fire;
8712,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And blind between my dream and my desire
8713,(FROM BOCCACCIO),I seemed to stand and held my spirit still
8714,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Lest this should cease. A child whose fingers spill
8715,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Honey from cells forgotten of the bee
8716,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Is less afraid to stir the hive and see
8717,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Some wasp's bright back inside, than I to feel"
8718,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Some finger-touch disturb the flesh like steel.
8719,(FROM BOCCACCIO),I prayed thus; Let me catch a secret here
8720,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"So sweet, it sharpens the sweet taste of fear"
8721,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And takes the mouth with edge of wine; I would
8722,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Have here some colour and smooth shape as good
8723,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As those in heaven whom the chief garden hides
8724,(FROM BOCCACCIO),With low grape-blossom veiling their white sides
8725,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And lesser tendrils that so bind and blind
8726,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Their eyes and feet, that if one come behind"
8727,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"To touch their hair they see not, neither fly;"
8728,(FROM BOCCACCIO),This would I see in heaven and not die.
8729,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"So praying, I had nigh cried out and knelt,"
8730,(FROM BOCCACCIO),So wholly my prayer filled me: till I felt
8731,(FROM BOCCACCIO),In the dumb night's warm weight of glowing gloom
8732,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Somewhat that altered all my sleeping-room,"
8733,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And made it like a green low place wherein
8734,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Maids mix to bathe: one sets her small warm chin
8735,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Against a ripple, that the angry pearl"
8736,(FROM BOCCACCIO),May flow like flame about her: the next curl
8737,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Dips in some eddy coloured of the sun
8738,(FROM BOCCACCIO),To wash the dust well out; another one
8739,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Holds a straight ankle in her hand and swings
8740,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"With lavish body sidelong, so that rings"
8741,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Of sweet fierce water, swollen and splendid, fail"
8742,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"All round her fine and floated body pale,"
8743,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Swayed flower-fashion, and her balanced side"
8744,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Swerved edgeways lets the weight of water slide,"
8745,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As taken in some underflow of sea
8746,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Swerves the banked gold of sea-flowers; but she
8747,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Pulls down some branch to keep her perfect head
8748,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Clear of the river: even from wall to bed,"
8749,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"I tell you, was my room transfigured so."
8750,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Sweet, green and warm it was, nor could one know"
8751,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"If there were walls or leaves, or if there was"
8752,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"No bed's green curtain, but mere gentle grass."
8753,(FROM BOCCACCIO),There were set also hard against the feet
8754,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Gold plates with honey and green grapes to eat,"
8755,(FROM BOCCACCIO),With the cool water's noise to hear in rhymes:
8756,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And a wind warmed me full of furze and limes
8757,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And all hot sweets the heavy summer fills
8758,(FROM BOCCACCIO),To the round brim of smooth cup-shapen hills.
8759,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Next the grave walking of a woman's feet
8760,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Made my veins hesitate, and gracious heat"
8761,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Made thick the lids and leaden on mine eyes:
8762,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And I thought ever, surely it were wise"
8763,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Not yet to see her: this may last (who knows?)
8764,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Five minutes; the poor rose is twice a rose
8765,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Because it turns a face to her, the wind"
8766,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Sings that way; hath this woman ever sinned,"
8767,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"I wonder? as a boy with apple-rind,"
8768,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"I played with pleasures, made them to my mind,"
8769,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Changed each ere tasting. When she came indeed,"
8770,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"First her hair touched me, then I grew to feed"
8771,(FROM BOCCACCIO),On the sense of her hand; her mouth at last
8772,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Touched me between the cheek and lip and past
8773,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Over my face with kisses here and there
8774,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Sown in and out across the eyes and hair.
8775,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Still I said nothing; till she set her face
8776,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"More close and harder on the kissing-place,"
8777,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And her mouth caught like a snake's mouth, and stung"
8778,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"So faint and tenderly, the fang scarce clung"
8779,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"More than a bird's foot: yet a wound it grew,"
8780,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"A great one, let this red mark witness you"
8781,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Under the left breast; and the stroke thereof
8782,(FROM BOCCACCIO),So clove my sense that I woke out of love
8783,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And knew not what this dream was nor had wit;
8784,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"But now God knows if I have skill of it."""
8785,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Hereat she laid one palm against her lips
8786,(FROM BOCCACCIO),To stop their trembling; as when water slips
8787,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Out of a beak-mouthed vessel with faint noise
8788,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And chuckles in the narrowed throat and cloys
8789,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The carven rims with murmuring, so came"
8790,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Words in her lips with no word right of them,"
8791,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"A beaten speech thick and disconsolate,"
8792,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Till his smile ceasing waxed compassionate
8793,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Of her sore fear that grew from anything--
8794,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The sound of the strong summer thickening
8795,(FROM BOCCACCIO),In heated leaves of the smooth apple-trees:
8796,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"The day's breath felt about the ash-branches,"
8797,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And noises of the noon whose weight still grew
8798,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"On the hot heavy-headed flowers, and drew"
8799,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Their red mouths open till the rose-heart ached;
8800,(FROM BOCCACCIO),For eastward all the crowding rose was slaked
8801,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And soothed with shade: but westward all its growth
8802,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Seemed to breathe hard with heat as a man doth
8803,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Who feels his temples newly feverous.
8804,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And even with such motion in her brows
8805,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"As that man hath in whom sick days begin,"
8806,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"She turned her throat and spake, her voice being thin"
8807,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"As a sick man's, sudden and tremulous;"
8808,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"""Sweet, if this end be come indeed on us,"
8809,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Let us love more;"" and held his mouth with hers."
8810,(FROM BOCCACCIO),As the first sound of flooded hill-waters
8811,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Is heard by people of the meadow-grass,"
8812,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Or ever a wandering waif of ruin pass
8813,(FROM BOCCACCIO),With whirling stones and foam of the brown stream
8814,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Flaked with fierce yellow: so beholding him
8815,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"She felt before tears came her eyelids wet,"
8816,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Saw the face deadly thin where life was yet,"
8817,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Heard his throat's harsh last moan before it clomb:
8818,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And he, with close mouth passionate and dumb,"
8819,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Burned at her lips: so lay they without speech,"
8820,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Each grasping other, and the eyes of each"
8821,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Fed in the other's face: till suddenly
8822,(FROM BOCCACCIO),He cried out with a little broken cry
8823,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"This word, ""O help me, sweet, I am but dead."""
8824,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And even so saying, the colour of fair red"
8825,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Was gone out of his face, and his blood's beat"
8826,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Fell, and stark death made sharp his upward feet"
8827,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And pointed hands; and without moan he died.
8828,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Pain smote her sudden in the brows and side,"
8829,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Strained her lips open and made burn her eyes:
8830,(FROM BOCCACCIO),For the pure sharpness of her miseries
8831,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"She had no heart's pain, but mere body's wrack;"
8832,(FROM BOCCACCIO),But at the last her beaten blood drew back
8833,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Slowly upon her face, and her stunned brows"
8834,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Suddenly grown aware and piteous
8835,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Gathered themselves, her eyes shone, her hard breath"
8836,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Came as though one nigh dead came back from death;
8837,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Her lips throbbed, and life trembled through her hair."
8838,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And in brief while she thought to bury there
8839,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The dead man that her love might lie with him
8840,(FROM BOCCACCIO),In a sweet bed under the rose-roots dim
8841,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"And soft earth round the branchèd apple-trees,"
8842,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Full of hushed heat and heavy with great ease,"
8843,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And no man entering divide him thence.
8844,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Wherefore she bade one of her handmaidens
8845,(FROM BOCCACCIO),To be her help to do upon this wise.
8846,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And saying so the tears out of her eyes
8847,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Fell without noise and comforted her heart:
8848,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Yea, her great pain eased of the sorest part"
8849,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Began to soften in her sense of it.
8850,(FROM BOCCACCIO),There under all the little branches sweet
8851,(FROM BOCCACCIO),The place was shapen of his burial;
8852,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"They shed thereon no thing funereal,"
8853,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"But coloured leaves of latter rose-blossom,"
8854,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Stems of soft grass, some withered red and some"
8855,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Fair and fresh-blooded; and spoil splendider
8856,(FROM BOCCACCIO),Of marigold and great spent sunflower.
8857,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And afterward she came back without word
8858,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"To her own house; two days went, and the third"
8859,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Went, and she showed her father of this thing."
8860,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And for great grief of her soul's travailing
8861,(FROM BOCCACCIO),He gave consent she should endure in peace
8862,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"Till her life's end; yea, till her time should cease,"
8863,(FROM BOCCACCIO),She should abide in fellowship of pain.
8864,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And having lived a holy year or twain
8865,(FROM BOCCACCIO),She died of pure waste heart and weariness.
8866,(FROM BOCCACCIO),And for love's honour in her love's distress
8867,(FROM BOCCACCIO),This word was written over her tomb's head;
8868,(FROM BOCCACCIO),"""Here dead she lieth, for whose sake Love is dead."""

8874,AHOLIBAH,
8875,AHOLIBAH,
8876,AHOLIBAH,In the beginning God made thee
8877,AHOLIBAH,"A woman well to look upon,"
8878,AHOLIBAH,Thy tender body as a tree
8879,AHOLIBAH,Whereon cool wind hath always blown
8880,AHOLIBAH,Till the clean branches be well grown.
8881,AHOLIBAH,
8882,AHOLIBAH,There was none like thee in the land;
8883,AHOLIBAH,The girls that were thy bondwomen
8884,AHOLIBAH,Did bind thee with a purple band
8885,AHOLIBAH,"Upon thy forehead, that all men"
8886,AHOLIBAH,Should know thee for God's handmaiden.
8887,AHOLIBAH,
8888,AHOLIBAH,"Strange raiment clad thee like a bride,"
8889,AHOLIBAH,With silk to wear on hands and feet
8890,AHOLIBAH,And plates of gold on either side:
8891,AHOLIBAH,"Wine made thee glad, and thou didst eat"
8892,AHOLIBAH,"Honey, and choice of pleasant meat."
8893,AHOLIBAH,
8894,AHOLIBAH,And fishers in the middle sea
8895,AHOLIBAH,Did get thee sea-fish and sea-weeds
8896,AHOLIBAH,In colour like the robes on thee;
8897,AHOLIBAH,"And curious work of plaited reeds,"
8898,AHOLIBAH,And wools wherein live purple bleeds.
8899,AHOLIBAH,
8900,AHOLIBAH,And round the edges of thy cup
8901,AHOLIBAH,"Men wrought thee marvels out of gold,"
8902,AHOLIBAH,"Strong snakes with lean throats lifted up,"
8903,AHOLIBAH,"Large eyes whereon the brows had hold,"
8904,AHOLIBAH,And scaly things their slime kept cold.
8905,AHOLIBAH,
8906,AHOLIBAH,For thee they blew soft wind in flutes
8907,AHOLIBAH,And ground sweet roots for cunning scent;
8908,AHOLIBAH,"Made slow because of many lutes,"
8909,AHOLIBAH,The wind among thy chambers went
8910,AHOLIBAH,Wherein no light was violent.
8911,AHOLIBAH,
8912,AHOLIBAH,"God called thy name Aholibah,"
8913,AHOLIBAH,"His tabernacle being in thee,"
8914,AHOLIBAH,A witness through waste Asia;
8915,AHOLIBAH,Thou wert a tent sewn cunningly
8916,AHOLIBAH,With gold and colours of the sea.
8917,AHOLIBAH,
8918,AHOLIBAH,God gave thee gracious ministers
8919,AHOLIBAH,And all their work who plait and weave:
8920,AHOLIBAH,The cunning of embroiderers
8921,AHOLIBAH,"That sew the pillow to the sleeve,"
8922,AHOLIBAH,And likeness of all things that live.
8923,AHOLIBAH,
8924,AHOLIBAH,Thy garments upon thee were fair
8925,AHOLIBAH,With scarlet and with yellow thread;
8926,AHOLIBAH,Also the weaving of thine hair
8927,AHOLIBAH,"Was as fine gold upon thy head,"
8928,AHOLIBAH,And thy silk shoes were sewn with red.
8929,AHOLIBAH,
8930,AHOLIBAH,"All sweet things he bade sift, and ground"
8931,AHOLIBAH,As a man grindeth wheat in mills
8932,AHOLIBAH,With strong wheels alway going round;
8933,AHOLIBAH,"He gave thee corn, and grass that fills"
8934,AHOLIBAH,The cattle on a thousand hills.
8935,AHOLIBAH,
8936,AHOLIBAH,The wine of many seasons fed
8937,AHOLIBAH,"Thy mouth, and made it fair and clean;"
8938,AHOLIBAH,Sweet oil was poured out on thy head
8939,AHOLIBAH,And ran down like cool rain between
8940,AHOLIBAH,The strait close locks it melted in.
8941,AHOLIBAH,
8942,AHOLIBAH,The strong men and the captains knew
8943,AHOLIBAH,Thy chambers wrought and fashioned
8944,AHOLIBAH,"With gold and covering of blue,"
8945,AHOLIBAH,And the blue raiment of thine head
8946,AHOLIBAH,Who satest on a stately bed.
8947,AHOLIBAH,
8948,AHOLIBAH,All these had on their garments wrought
8949,AHOLIBAH,"The shape of beasts and creeping things,"
8950,AHOLIBAH,"The body that availeth not,"
8951,AHOLIBAH,"Flat backs of worms and veinèd wings,"
8952,AHOLIBAH,And the lewd bulk that sleeps and stings.
8953,AHOLIBAH,
8954,AHOLIBAH,"Also the chosen of the years,"
8955,AHOLIBAH,"The multitude being at ease,"
8956,AHOLIBAH,With sackbuts and with dulcimers
8957,AHOLIBAH,And noise of shawms and psalteries
8958,AHOLIBAH,Made mirth within the ears of these.
8959,AHOLIBAH,
8960,AHOLIBAH,"But as a common woman doth,"
8961,AHOLIBAH,Thou didst think evil and devise;
8962,AHOLIBAH,The sweet smell of thy breast and mouth
8963,AHOLIBAH,"Thou madest as the harlot's wise,"
8964,AHOLIBAH,And there was painting on thine eyes.
8965,AHOLIBAH,
8966,AHOLIBAH,"Yea, in the woven guest-chamber"
8967,AHOLIBAH,And by the painted passages
8968,AHOLIBAH,"Where the strange gracious paintings were,"
8969,AHOLIBAH,"State upon state of companies,"
8970,AHOLIBAH,There came on thee the lust of these.
8971,AHOLIBAH,
8972,AHOLIBAH,Because of shapes on either wall
8973,AHOLIBAH,Sea-coloured from some rare blue shell
8974,AHOLIBAH,"At many a Tyrian interval,"
8975,AHOLIBAH,"Horsemen on horses, girdled well,"
8976,AHOLIBAH,"Delicate and desirable,"
8977,AHOLIBAH,
8978,AHOLIBAH,Thou saidest: I am sick of love:
8979,AHOLIBAH,"Stay me with flagons, comfort me"
8980,AHOLIBAH,With apples for my pain thereof
8981,AHOLIBAH,Till my hands gather in his tree
8982,AHOLIBAH,That fruit wherein my lips would be.
8983,AHOLIBAH,
8984,AHOLIBAH,"Yea, saidest thou, I will go up"
8985,AHOLIBAH,When there is no more shade than one
8986,AHOLIBAH,"May cover with a hollow cup,"
8987,AHOLIBAH,And make my bed against the sun
8988,AHOLIBAH,Till my blood's violence be done.
8989,AHOLIBAH,
8990,AHOLIBAH,Thy mouth was leant upon the wall
8991,AHOLIBAH,"Against the painted mouth, thy chin"
8992,AHOLIBAH,Touched the hair's painted curve and fall;
8993,AHOLIBAH,"Thy deep throat, fallen lax and thin,"
8994,AHOLIBAH,Worked as the blood's beat worked therein.
8995,AHOLIBAH,
8996,AHOLIBAH,"Therefore, O thou Aholibah,"
8997,AHOLIBAH,God is not glad because of thee;
8998,AHOLIBAH,And thy fine gold shall pass away
8999,AHOLIBAH,Like those fair coins of ore that be
9000,AHOLIBAH,Washed over by the middle sea.
9001,AHOLIBAH,
9002,AHOLIBAH,Then will one make thy body bare
9003,AHOLIBAH,"To strip it of all gracious things,"
9004,AHOLIBAH,"And pluck the cover from thine hair,"
9005,AHOLIBAH,"And break the gift of many kings,"
9006,AHOLIBAH,Thy wrist-rings and thine ankle-rings.
9007,AHOLIBAH,
9008,AHOLIBAH,Likewise the man whose body joins
9009,AHOLIBAH,"To thy smooth body, as was said,"
9010,AHOLIBAH,Who hath a girdle on his loins
9011,AHOLIBAH,And dyed attire upon his head--
9012,AHOLIBAH,"The same who, seeing, worshipped,"
9013,AHOLIBAH,
9014,AHOLIBAH,Because thy face was like the face
9015,AHOLIBAH,"Of a clean maiden that smells sweet,"
9016,AHOLIBAH,Because thy gait was as the pace
9017,AHOLIBAH,Of one that opens not her feet
9018,AHOLIBAH,And is not heard within the street--
9019,AHOLIBAH,
9020,AHOLIBAH,"Even he, O thou Aholibah,"
9021,AHOLIBAH,"Made separate from thy desire,"
9022,AHOLIBAH,Shall cut thy nose and ears away
9023,AHOLIBAH,And bruise thee for thy body's hire
9024,AHOLIBAH,And burn the residue with fire.
9025,AHOLIBAH,
9026,AHOLIBAH,"Then shall the heathen people say,"
9027,AHOLIBAH,The multitude being at ease;
9028,AHOLIBAH,"Lo, this is that Aholibah"
9029,AHOLIBAH,Whose name was blown among strange seas.
9030,AHOLIBAH,Grown old with soft adulteries.
9031,AHOLIBAH,
9032,AHOLIBAH,"Also her bed was made of green,"
9033,AHOLIBAH,Her windows beautiful for glass
9034,AHOLIBAH,That she had made her bed between:
9035,AHOLIBAH,"Yea, for pure lust her body was"
9036,AHOLIBAH,Made like white summer-coloured grass.
9037,AHOLIBAH,
9038,AHOLIBAH,Her raiment was a strong man's spoil;
9039,AHOLIBAH,Upon a table by a bed
9040,AHOLIBAH,She set mine incense and mine oil
9041,AHOLIBAH,To be the beauty of her head
9042,AHOLIBAH,In chambers walled about with red.
9043,AHOLIBAH,
9044,AHOLIBAH,Also between the walls she had
9045,AHOLIBAH,Fair faces of strong men portrayed;
9046,AHOLIBAH,"All girded round the loins, and clad"
9047,AHOLIBAH,With several cloths of woven braid
9048,AHOLIBAH,And garments marvellously made.
9049,AHOLIBAH,
9050,AHOLIBAH,Therefore the wrath of God shall be
9051,AHOLIBAH,Set as a watch upon her way;
9052,AHOLIBAH,And whoso findeth by the sea
9053,AHOLIBAH,Blown dust of bones will hardly say
9054,AHOLIBAH,If this were that Aholibah.

9091,MADONNA MIA,
9092,MADONNA MIA,She hath no handmaid fair
9093,MADONNA MIA,To draw her curled gold hair

9099,MADONNA MIA,None is so great.
9100,MADONNA MIA,
9101,MADONNA MIA,She hath no more to wear

9123,MADONNA MIA,In the deep-feathered firs

9145,MADONNA MIA,

9154,MADONNA MIA,
9155,MADONNA MIA,This is my lady's praise:

9162,MADONNA MIA,Between her hands.
9163,MADONNA MIA,
9164,MADONNA MIA,Under deep apple-boughs

9664,DEDICATION,Dawn drives them before her like dreams;
9665,DEDICATION,"Time sheds them like snows on strange regions,"
9666,DEDICATION,Swept shoreward on infinite streams;
9667,DEDICATION,"Leaves pallid and sombre and ruddy,"
9668,DEDICATION,Dead fruits of the fugitive years;
9669,DEDICATION,"Some stained as with wine and made bloody,"
9670,DEDICATION,And some as with tears.
9671,DEDICATION,
9672,DEDICATION,"Some scattered in seven years' traces,"
9673,DEDICATION,As they fell from the boy that was then;
9674,DEDICATION,"Long left among idle green places,"
9675,DEDICATION,Or gathered but now among men;
9676,DEDICATION,"On seas full of wonder and peril,"
9677,DEDICATION,Blown white round the capes of the north;
9678,DEDICATION,Or in islands where myrtles are sterile
9679,DEDICATION,And loves bring not forth.
9680,DEDICATION,
9681,DEDICATION,O daughters of dreams and of stories
9682,DEDICATION,"That life is not wearied of yet,"
9683,DEDICATION,"Faustine, Fragoletta, Dolores,"
9684,DEDICATION,"Félise and Yolande and Juliette,"
9685,DEDICATION,"Shall I find you not still, shall I miss you,"
9686,DEDICATION,"When sleep, that is true or that seems,"
9687,DEDICATION,"Comes back to me hopeless to kiss you,"
9688,DEDICATION,O daughters of dreams?
9689,DEDICATION,
9690,DEDICATION,"They are past as a slumber that passes,"
9691,DEDICATION,As the dew of a dawn of old time;
9692,DEDICATION,"More frail than the shadows on glasses,"
9693,DEDICATION,More fleet than a wave or a rhyme.
9694,DEDICATION,"As the waves after ebb drawing seaward,"
9695,DEDICATION,"When their hollows are full of the night,"
9696,DEDICATION,So the birds that flew singing to me-ward
9697,DEDICATION,Recede out of sight.
9698,DEDICATION,
9699,DEDICATION,"The songs of dead seasons, that wander"
9700,DEDICATION,On wings of articulate words;
9701,DEDICATION,"Lost leaves that the shore-wind may squander,"
9702,DEDICATION,Light flocks of untameable birds;
9703,DEDICATION,Some sang to me dreaming in class-time
9704,DEDICATION,And truant in hand as in tongue;
9705,DEDICATION,"For the youngest were born of boy's pastime,"
9706,DEDICATION,The eldest are young.
9707,DEDICATION,
9708,DEDICATION,"Is there shelter while life in them lingers,"
9709,DEDICATION,"Is there hearing for songs that recede,"
9710,DEDICATION,Tunes touched from a harp with man's fingers
9711,DEDICATION,Or blown with boy's mouth in a reed?
9712,DEDICATION,"Is there place in the land of your labour,"
9713,DEDICATION,"Is there room in your world of delight,"
9714,DEDICATION,Where change has not sorrow for neighbour
9715,DEDICATION,And day has not night?
9716,DEDICATION,
9717,DEDICATION,"In their wings though the sea-wind yet quivers,"
9718,DEDICATION,Will you spare not a space for them there
9719,DEDICATION,Made green with the running of rivers
9720,DEDICATION,And gracious with temperate air;
9721,DEDICATION,"In the fields and the turreted cities,"
9722,DEDICATION,That cover from sunshine and rain
9723,DEDICATION,Fair passions and bountiful pities
9724,DEDICATION,And loves without stain?
9725,DEDICATION,
9726,DEDICATION,"In a land of clear colours and stories,"
9727,DEDICATION,"In a region of shadowless hours,"
9728,DEDICATION,Where earth has a garment of glories
9729,DEDICATION,And a murmur of musical flowers;
9730,DEDICATION,In woods where the spring half uncovers
9731,DEDICATION,"The flush of her amorous face,"
9732,DEDICATION,"By the waters that listen for lovers,"
9733,DEDICATION,For these is there place?
9734,DEDICATION,
9735,DEDICATION,"For the song-birds of sorrow, that muffle"
9736,DEDICATION,Their music as clouds do their fire:
9737,DEDICATION,"For the storm-birds of passion, that ruffle"
9738,DEDICATION,Wild wings in a wind of desire;
9739,DEDICATION,In the stream of the storm as it settles
9740,DEDICATION,"Blown seaward, borne far from the sun,"
9741,DEDICATION,Shaken loose on the darkness like petals
9742,DEDICATION,Dropt one after one?
9743,DEDICATION,
9744,DEDICATION,Though the world of your hands be more gracious
9745,DEDICATION,And lovelier in lordship of things
9746,DEDICATION,Clothed round by sweet art with the spacious
9747,DEDICATION,"Warm heaven of her imminent wings,"
9748,DEDICATION,"Let them enter, unfledged and nigh fainting,"
9749,DEDICATION,For the love of old loves and lost times;
9750,DEDICATION,And receive in your palace of painting
9751,DEDICATION,This revel of rhymes.
9752,DEDICATION,
9753,DEDICATION,Though the seasons of man full of losses
9754,DEDICATION,"Make empty the years full of youth,"
9755,DEDICATION,"If but one thing be constant in crosses,"
9756,DEDICATION,Change lays not her hand upon truth;
9757,DEDICATION,"Hopes die, and their tombs are for token"
9758,DEDICATION,That the grief as the joy of them ends
9759,DEDICATION,Ere time that breaks all men has broken
9760,DEDICATION,The faith between friends.
9761,DEDICATION,
9762,DEDICATION,"Though the many lights dwindle to one light,"
9763,DEDICATION,There is help if the heaven has one;
9764,DEDICATION,Though the skies be discrowned of the sunlight
9765,DEDICATION,"And the earth dispossessed of the sun,"
9766,DEDICATION,"They have moonlight and sleep for repayment,"
9767,DEDICATION,"When, refreshed as a bride and set free,"
9768,DEDICATION,"With stars and sea-winds in her raiment,"
9769,DEDICATION,Night sinks on the sea.
