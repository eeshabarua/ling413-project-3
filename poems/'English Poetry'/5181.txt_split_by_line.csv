29,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The mighty spirit, and its power, which stains"
30,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The bloodless cheek, and vivifies the brains,"
31,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","I sing. Say, ye, its fiery vot'ries true,"
32,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The jovial curate, and the shrill-tongued shrew;"
33,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Ye, in the floods of limpid poison nurst,"
34,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Where bowl the second charms like bowl the first;
35,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Say how, and why, the sparkling ill is shed,"
36,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The heart which hardens, and which rules the head."
37,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","When winter stern his gloomy front uprears,"
38,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",A sable void the barren earth appears;
39,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The meads no more their former verdure boast,"
40,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Fast bound their streams, and all their beauty lost;"
41,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The herds, the flocks, in icy garments mourn,"
42,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And wildly murmur for the spring's return;
43,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","From snow-topp'd hills the whirlwinds keenly blow,"
44,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Howl through the woods, and pierce the vales below;"
45,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Through the sharp air a flaky torrent flies,"
46,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Mocks the slow sight, and hides the gloomy skies;"
47,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The fleecy clouds their chilly bosoms bare,"
48,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And shed their substance on the floating air;
49,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",The floating air their downy substance glides
50,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Through springing waters, and prevents their tides;"
51,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Seizes the rolling waves, and, as a god,"
52,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Charms their swift race, and stops the refluent flood;"
53,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The opening valves, which fill the venal road,"
54,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Then scarcely urge along the sanguine flood;
55,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The labouring pulse a slower motion rules,"
56,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The tendons stiffen, and the spirit cools;"
57,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Each asks the aid of Nature's sister, Art,"
58,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","To cheer the senses, and to warm the heart."
59,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The gentle fair on nervous tea relies,"
60,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Whilst gay good-nature sparkles in her eyes;
61,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","An inoffensive scandal fluttering round,"
62,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Too rough to tickle, and too light to wound;"
63,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Champagne the courtier drinks, the spleen to chase,"
64,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The colonel burgundy, and port his grace;"
65,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Turtle and 'rrac the city rulers charm,"
66,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Ale and content the labouring peasants warm:
67,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","O'er the dull embers, happy Colin sits,"
68,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Colin, the prince of joke, and rural wits;"
69,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Whilst the wind whistles through the hollow panes,"
70,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","He drinks, nor of the rude assault complains;"
71,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","And tells the tale, from sire to son retold,"
72,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Of spirits vanishing near hidden gold;
73,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Of moon-clad imps that tremble by the dew,"
74,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Who skim the air, or glide o'er waters blue:"
75,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The throng invisible that, doubtless, float"
76,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","By mouldering tombs, and o'er the stagnant meat:"
77,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Fays dimly glancing on the russet plain,"
78,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And all the dreadful nothing of the green.
79,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Peace be to such, the happiest and the best,"
80,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Who with the forms of fancy urge their jest;
81,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Who wage no war with an avenger's rod,"
82,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Nor in the pride of reason curse their God.
83,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","When in the vaulted arch Lucina gleams,"
84,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And gaily dances o'er the azure streams;
85,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",On silent ether when a trembling sound
86,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Reverberates, and wildly floats around,"
87,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Breaking through trackless space upon the ear,"
88,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Conclude the Bacchanalian rustic near:
89,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","O'er hills and vales the jovial savage reels,"
90,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Fire in his head and frenzy at his heels;
91,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","From paths direct the bending hero swerves,"
92,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And shapes his way in ill-proportioned curves.
93,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Now safe arrived, his sleeping rib he calls,"
94,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And madly thunders on the muddy walls;
95,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The well-known sounds an equal fury move,"
96,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","For rage meets rage, as love enkindles love:"
97,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","In vain the waken'd infant's accents shrill,"
98,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",The humble regions of the cottage fill;
99,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","In vain the cricket chirps the mansion through,"
100,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","'Tis war, and blood, and battle must ensue."
101,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","As when, on humble stage, him Satan hight"
102,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Defies the brazen hero to the fight:
103,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","From twanging strokes what dire misfortunes rise,"
104,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",What fate to maple arms and glassen eyes!
105,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Here lies a leg of elm, and there a stroke"
106,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",From ashen neck has whirl'd a head of oak.
107,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","So drops from either power, with vengeance big,"
108,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",A remnant night-cap and an old cut wig;
109,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Titles unmusical retorted round,"
110,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",On either ear with leaden vengeance sound;
111,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Till equal valour, equal wounds create,"
112,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And drowsy peace concludes the fell debate;
113,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Sleep in her woollen mantle wraps the pair,"
114,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And sheds her poppies on the ambient air;
115,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Intoxication flies, as fury fled,"
116,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",On rooky pinions quits the aching head;
117,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Returning reason cools the fiery blood,"
118,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And drives from memory's seat the rosy god.
119,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Yet still he holds o'er some his maddening rule.
120,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Still sways his sceptre, and still knows his fool;"
121,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Witness the livid lip, and fiery front,"
122,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",With many a smarting trophy placed upon't;
123,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The hollow eye, which plays in misty springs,"
124,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","And the hoarse voice, which rough and broken rings;"
125,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","These are his triumphs, and o'er these he reigns,"
126,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",The blinking deity of reeling brains.
127,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","See Inebriety! her wand she waves,"
128,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","And lo! her pale, and lo! her purple slaves!"
129,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Sots in embroidery, and sots in crape,"
130,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Of every order, station, rank, and shape:"
131,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The king, who nods upon his rattle throne;"
132,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The staggering peer, to midnight revel prone;"
133,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The slow-tongued bishop, and the deacon sly,"
134,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The humble pensioner, and gownsman dry;"
135,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The proud, the mean, the selfish, and the great,"
136,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Swell the dull throng, and stagger into state."
137,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Lo! proud Flaminius at the splendid board,"
138,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The easy chaplain of an atheist lord,"
139,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Quaffs the bright juice, with all the gust of sense,"
140,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",And clouds his brain in torpid elegance;
141,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","In china vases, see! the sparkling ill,"
142,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",From gay decanters view the rosy rill;
143,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The neat-carved pipes in silver settle laid,"
144,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",The screw by mathematic cunning made:
145,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Oh, happy priest! whose God, like Egypt's, lies"
146,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",At once the deity and sacrifice.
147,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",But is Flaminius then the man alone
148,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",To whom the joys of swimming brains are known?
149,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Lo! the poor toper whose untutor'd sense,"
150,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Sees bliss in ale, and can with wine dispense;"
151,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Whose head proud fancy never taught to steer
152,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Beyond the muddy ecstasies of beer;
153,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","But simple nature can her longing quench,"
154,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Behind the settle's curve, or humbler bench:"
155,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Some kitchen fire diffusing warmth around,"
156,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",The semi-globe by hieroglyphics crown'd;
157,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Where canvas purse displays the brass enroll'd,"
158,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Nor waiters rave, nor landlords thirst for gold;"
159,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Ale and content his fancy's bounds confine.
160,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","He asks no limpid punch, no rosy wine;"
161,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","But sees, admitted to an equal share,"
162,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Each faithful swain the heady potion bear:
163,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Go, wiser thou! and in thy scale of taste,"
164,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Weigh gout and gravel against ale and rest;
165,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Call vulgar palates what thou judgest so;
166,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Say beer is heavy, windy, cold, and slow;"
167,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Laugh at poor sots with insolent pretence,"
168,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Yet cry, when tortured, where is Providence?"
169,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","In various forms the madd'ning spirit moves,"
170,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","This drinks and fights, another drinks and loves."
171,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","A bastard zeal, of different kinds it shows,"
172,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","And now with rage, and now religion glows:"
173,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","The frantic soul bright reason's path defies,"
174,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Now creeps on earth, now triumphs in the skies;"
175,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Swims in the seas of error, and explores,"
176,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Through midnight mists, the fluctuating shores;"
177,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","From wave to wave in rocky channel glides,"
178,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","And sinks in woe, or on presumption slides;"
179,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","In pride exalted, or by shame deprest,"
180,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","An angel-devil, or a human-beast."
181,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}",Some rage in all the strength of folly mad;

191,"""INEBRIETY"" {1}","Nor cares of state disturb his easy head,"
