39,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,
40,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,
41,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The Village Life, and every care that reigns"
42,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,O'er youthful peasants and declining swains;
43,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"What labour yields, and what, that labour past,"
44,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Age, in its hour of languor, finds at last;"
45,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"What form the real Picture of the Poor,"
46,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Demand a song--the Muse can give no more.
47,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Fled are those times, when, in harmonious strains,"
48,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,The rustic poet praised his native plains:
49,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"No Shepherds now, in smooth alternate verse,"
50,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Their country's beauty or their nymphs rehearse;
51,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet still for these we frame the tender strain,"
52,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Still in our lays fond Corydons complain,"
53,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And shepherds' boys their amorous pains reveal,"
54,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The only pains, alas! they never feel."
55,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"On Mincio's banks, in Caesar's bounteous reign,"
56,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"If Tityrus found the Golden Age again,"
57,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Must sleepy bards the nattering dream prolong,"
58,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan song?
59,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"From Truth and Nature shall we widely stray,"
60,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Where Virgil, not where Fancy, leads the way?"
61,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Yes, thus the Muses sing of happy swains,"
62,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Because the Muses never knew their pains:
63,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,They boast their peasant's pipes; but peasants now
64,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Resign their pipes and plod behind the plough;
65,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And few, amid the rural tribe, have time"
66,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,To number syllables and play with rhyme;
67,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Save honest DUCK, what son of verse could share"
68,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,The poet's rapture and the peasant's care?
69,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Or the great labours of the field degrade,"
70,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,With the new peril of a poorer trade?
71,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"From this chief cause these idle praises spring,"
72,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,That themes so easy few forbear to sing;
73,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,For no deep thought the trifling subjects ask;
74,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,To sing of shepherds is an easy task:
75,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The happy youth assumes the common strain,"
76,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"A nymph his mistress, and himself a swain;"
77,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer,"
78,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"But all, to look like her, is painted fair."
79,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,I grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms
80,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,For him that grazes or for him that farms;
81,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,But when amid such pleasing scenes I trace
82,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The poor laborious natives of the place,"
83,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And see the mid-day sun, with fervid ray,"
84,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,On their bare heads and dewy temples play;
85,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"While some, with feebler heads and fainter hearts,"
86,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Deplore their fortune, yet sustain their parts"
87,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Then shall I dare these real ills to hide
88,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,In tinsel trappings of poetic pride?
89,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"No; cast by Fortune on a frowning coast,"
90,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Which neither groves nor happy valleys boast;
91,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Where other cares than those the Muse relates,"
92,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And other shepherds dwell with other mates;
93,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"By such examples taught, I paint the Cot,"
94,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"As Truth will paint it, and as Bards will not:"
95,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Nor you, ye Poor, of letter'd scorn complain,"
96,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain;
97,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"O'ercome by labour, and bow'd down by time,"
98,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme?
99,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Can poets soothe you, when you pine for bread,"
100,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,By winding myrtles round your ruin'd shed?
101,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower,"
102,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour?
103,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Lo! where the heath, with withering brake grown o'er,"
104,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Lends the light turf that warms the neighbouring poor;
105,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"From thence a length of burning sand appears,"
106,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Where the thin harvest waves its wither'd ears;
107,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Rank weeds, that every art and care defy,"
108,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Reign o'er the land, and rob the blighted rye."
109,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"There thistles stretch their prickly arms afar,"
110,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And to the ragged infant threaten war;
111,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"There poppies nodding, mock the hope of toil,"
112,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil;
113,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Hardy and high, above the slender sheaf,"
114,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf;
115,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade,"
116,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And clasping tares cling round the sickly blade.
117,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound,"
118,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And a sad splendour vainly shines around.
119,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"So looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn,"
120,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Betray'd by man, then left for man to scorn;"
121,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose,"
122,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,While her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose;
123,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose outward splendour is but folly's dress,"
124,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Exposing most, when most it gilds distress."
125,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race,"
126,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,With sullen woe display'd in every face;
127,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, far from civil arts and social fly,"
128,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye.
129,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Here too the lawless merchant of the main
130,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Draws from his plough th' intoxicated swain;
131,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Want only claim'd the labour of the day,"
132,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,But vice now steals his nightly rest away.
133,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Where are the swains, who, daily labour done,"
134,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,With rural games play'd down the setting sun;
135,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Who struck with matchless force the bounding ball,"
136,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Or made the pond'rous quoit obliquely fall;
137,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"While some huge Ajax, terrible and strong,"
138,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Engaged some artful stripling of the throng.
139,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And fell beneath him, foil'd, while far around"
140,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Hoarse triumph rose, and rocks return'd the sound?"
141,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Where now are these?--Beneath yon cliff they stand,"
142,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,To show the freighted pinnace where to land;
143,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"To load the ready steed with guilty haste,"
144,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"To fly in terror o'er the pathless waste,"
145,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, when detected, in their straggling course,"
146,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,To foil their foes by cunning or by force;
147,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Or, yielding part (which equal knaves demand),"
148,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,To gain a lawless passport through the land.
149,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, wand'ring long, amid these frowning fields,"
150,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,I sought the simple life that Nature yields;
151,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurp'd her place,"
152,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And a bold, artful, surly, savage race;"
153,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, only skill'd to take the finny tribe,"
154,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The yearly dinner, or septennial bribe,"
155,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Wait on the shore, and, as the waves run high,"
156,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"On the tost vessel bend their eager eye,"
157,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Which to their coast directs its vent'rous way;
158,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Theirs or the ocean's miserable prey.
159,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand,"
160,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And wait for favouring winds to leave the land;
161,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,While still for flight the ready wing is spread:
162,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"So waited I the favouring hour, and fled;"
163,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign,"
164,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And cried, Ah! hapless they who still remain;"
165,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Who still remain to hear the ocean roar,"
166,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore;
167,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Till some fierce tide, with more imperious sway,"
168,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Sweeps the low hut and all it holds away;
169,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,When the sad tenant weeps from door to door;
170,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And begs a poor protection from the poor!
171,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,But these are scenes where Nature's niggard hand
172,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Gave a spare portion to the famish'd land;
173,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Hers is the fault, if here mankind complain"
174,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Of fruitless toil and labour spent in vain;
175,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"But yet in other scenes more fair in view,"
176,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,When Plenty smiles--alas! she smiles for few -
177,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And those who taste not, yet behold her store,"
178,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore -
179,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,The wealth around them makes them doubly poor.
180,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Or will you deem them amply paid in health,"
181,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Labour's fair child, that languishes with wealth?"
182,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Go then! and see them rising with the sun,"
183,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Through a long course of daily toil to run;
184,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"See them beneath the Dog-star's raging heat,"
185,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,When the knees tremble and the temples beat;
186,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Behold them, leaning on their scythes, look o'er"
187,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The labour past, and toils to come explore;"
188,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"See them alternate suns and showers engage,"
189,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And hoard up aches and anguish for their age;
190,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue,"
191,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew;
192,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Then own that labour may as fatal be
193,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"To these thy slaves, as thine excess to thee."
194,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride
195,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide;
196,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,There may you see the youth of slender frame
197,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Contend with weakness, weariness, and shame;"
198,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet, urged along, and proudly loth to yield,"
199,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,He strives to join his fellows of the field:
200,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Till long-contending nature droops at last,"
201,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Declining health rejects his poor repast,"
202,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"His cheerless spouse the coming danger sees,"
203,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease.
204,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Yet grant them health, 'tis not for us to tell,"
205,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Though the head droops not, that the heart is well;"
206,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Or will you praise that homely, healthy fare,"
207,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Plenteous and plain, that happy peasants share?"
208,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Oh! trifle not with wants you cannot feel,"
209,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Nor mock the misery of a stinted meal;
210,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Homely, not wholesome, plain, not plenteous, such"
211,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,As you who praise would never deign to touch.
212,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Ye gentle souls, who dream of rural ease,"
213,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please;
214,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Go! if the peaceful cot your praises share,"
215,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Go look within, and ask if peace be there;"
216,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"If peace be his, that drooping weary sire;"
217,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Or theirs, that offspring round their feeble fire;"
218,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Or hers, that matron pale, whose trembling hand"
219,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Turns on the wretched hearth th' expiring brand!
220,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Nor yet can Time itself obtain for these
221,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Life's latest comforts, due respect and ease;"
222,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"For yonder see that hoary swain, whose age"
223,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Can with no cares except its own engage;
224,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Who, propt on that rude staff, looks up to see"
225,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The bare arms broken from the withering tree,"
226,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"On which, a boy, he climb'd the loftiest bough,"
227,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Then his first joy, but his sad emblem now."
228,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,He once was chief in all the rustic trade;
229,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,His steady hand the straightest furrow made;
230,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Full many a prize he won, and still is proud"
231,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,To find the triumphs of his youth allow'd;
232,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"A transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes,"
233,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"He hears and smiles, then thinks again and sighs:"
234,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,For now he journeys to his grave in pain;
235,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,The rich disdain him; nay the poor disdain:
236,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Alternate masters now their slave command,"
237,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Urge the weak efforts of his feeble hand,"
238,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And, when his age attempts its task in vain,"
239,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"With ruthless taunts, of lazy poor complain."
240,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Oft may you see him, when he tends the sheep,"
241,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"His winter charge, beneath the hillock weep;"
242,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow
243,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"O'er his white locks and bury them in snow,"
244,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"When, rous'd by rage and muttering in the morn,"
245,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,He mends the broken hedge with icy thorn:  -
246,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"""Why do I live, when I desire to be"
247,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,At once from life and life's long labour free?
248,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Like leaves in spring, the young are blown away,"
249,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Without the sorrows of a slow decay;
250,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"I, like yon withered leaf remain behind,"
251,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Nipt by the frost, and shivering in the wind;"
252,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,There it abides till younger buds come on
253,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"As I, now all my fellow-swains are gone,"
254,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Then from the rising generation thrust,"
255,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"It falls, like me, unnoticed to the dust."
256,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"""These fruitful fields, these numerous flocks I see,"
257,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Are others' gain, but killing cares to me;"
258,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"To me the children of my youth are lords,"
259,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Cool in their looks, but hasty in their words:"
260,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Wants of their own demand their care; and who
261,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Feels his own want and succours others too?
262,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"A lonely, wretched man, in pain I go,"
263,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"None need my help, and none relieve my woe;"
264,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Then let my bones beneath the turf be laid,"
265,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And men forget the wretch they would not aid."""
266,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Thus groan the old, till by disease oppress'd,"
267,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"They taste a final woe, and then they rest."
268,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Theirs is yon House that holds the parish poor,"
269,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door;
270,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"There, where the putrid vapours, flagging, play,"
271,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day;-
272,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,There children dwell who know no parents' care;
273,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Parents, who know no children's love, dwell there!"
274,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Heart-broken matrons on their joyless bed,"
275,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Forsaken wives, and mothers never wed;"
276,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Dejected widows with unheeded tears,"
277,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And crippled age with more than childhood fears;
278,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The lame, the blind, and, far the happiest they!"
279,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The moping idiot, and the madman gay."
280,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Here too the sick their final doom receive,"
281,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Here brought, amid the scenes of grief, to grieve,"
282,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow,"
283,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Mixt with the clamours of the crowd below;
284,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan,"
285,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And the cold charities of man to man:
286,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose laws indeed for ruin'd age provide,"
287,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride;
288,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh,"
289,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And pride embitters what it can't deny.
290,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Say, ye, opprest by some fantastic woes,"
291,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Some jarring nerve that baffles your repose;
292,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Who press the downy couch, while slaves advance"
293,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,With timid eye to read the distant glance;
294,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Who with sad prayers the weary doctor tease,"
295,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,To name the nameless ever new disease;
296,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Who with mock patience dire complaints endure,"
297,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Which real pain and that alone can cure;
298,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"How would ye bear in real pain to lie,"
299,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Despised, neglected, left alone to die?"
300,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,How would ye bear to draw your latest breath
301,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Where all that's wretched paves the way for death?
302,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Such is that room which one rude beam divides,"
303,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And naked rafters form the sloping sides;
304,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen,"
305,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And lath and mud are all that lie between;
306,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Save one dull pane, that, coarsely patch'd, gives way"
307,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"To the rude tempest, yet excludes the day:"
308,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Here, on a matted flock, with dust o'erspread,"
309,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,The drooping wretch reclines his languid head;
310,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"For him no hand the cordial cup applies,"
311,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Or wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes;
312,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"No friends with soft discourse his pain beguile,"
313,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Or promise hope, till sickness wears a smile."
314,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"But soon a loud and hasty summons calls,"
315,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls;"
316,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Anon, a figure enters, quaintly neat,"
317,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"All pride and business, bustle and conceit;"
318,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"With looks unalter'd by these scenes of woe,"
319,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"With speed that, entering, speaks his haste to go,"
320,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"He bids the gazing throng around him fly,"
321,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And carries fate and physic in his eye:
322,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"A potent quack, long versed in human ills,"
323,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Who first insults the victim whom he kills;
324,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy Bench protect,"
325,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And whose most tender mercy is neglect.
326,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Paid by the parish for attendance here,"
327,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer;
328,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"In haste he seeks the bed where Misery lies,"
329,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Impatience mark'd in his averted eyes;
330,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And, some habitual queries hurried o'er,"
331,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Without reply, he rushes on the door:"
332,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"His drooping patient, long inured to pain,"
333,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;"
334,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,He ceases now the feeble help to crave
335,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Of man; and silent sinks into the grave.
336,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"But ere his death some pious doubts arise,"
337,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Some simple fears, which ""bold bad"" men despise;"
338,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,Fain would he ask the parish priest to prove
339,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,His title certain to the joys above:
340,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"For this he sends the murmuring nurse, who calls"
341,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,The holy stranger to these dismal walls:
342,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And doth not he, the pious man, appear,"
343,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"He, ""passing rich, with forty pounds a year?"""
344,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Ah!no; a shepherd of a different stock,"
345,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And far unlike him, feeds this little flock:"
346,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"A jovial youth, who thinks his Sunday's task"
347,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,As much as God or man can fairly ask;
348,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"The rest he gives to loves and labours light,"
349,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"To fields the morning, and to feasts the night;"
350,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"None better skill'd the noisy pack to guide,"
351,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"To urge their chase, to cheer them or to chide;"
352,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"A sportsman keen, he shoots through half the day,"
353,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"And, skill'd at whist, devotes the night to play:"
354,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Then, while such honours bloom around his head,"
355,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Shall he sit sadly by the sick man's bed,"
356,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"To raise the hope he feels not, or with zeal"
357,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"To combat fears that e'en the pious, feel?"
358,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Now once again the gloomy scene explore,"
359,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Less gloomy now; the bitter hour is o'er,"
360,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,The man of many sorrows sighs no more. -
361,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Up yonder hill, behold how sadly slow"
362,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,The bier moves winding from the vale below:
363,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"There lie the happy dead, from trouble free,"
364,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,And the glad parish pays the frugal fee:
365,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"No more, O Death! thy victim starts to hear"
366,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Churchwarden stern, or kingly overseer;"
367,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"No more the farmer claims his humble bow,"
368,BOOK I.--THE ARGUMENT.,"Thou art his lord, the best of tyrants thou!"

738,THE ARGUMENT,To drop the precious food but once a week.
739,THE ARGUMENT,"Endless it were to sing the powers of all,"
740,THE ARGUMENT,"Their names, their numbers; how they rise and fall:"
741,THE ARGUMENT,"Like baneful herbs the gazer's eye they seize,"
742,THE ARGUMENT,"Rush to the head, and poison where they please:"
743,THE ARGUMENT,"Like idle flies, a busy, buzzing train,"
744,THE ARGUMENT,They drop their maggots in the trifler's brain:
745,THE ARGUMENT,"That genia soil receives the fruitful store,"
746,THE ARGUMENT,"And there they grow, and breed a thousand more."
747,THE ARGUMENT,"Now be their arts display'd, how first they choose"
748,THE ARGUMENT,"A cause and party, as the bard his Muse;"
749,THE ARGUMENT,"Inspired by these, with clamorous zeal they cry,"
750,THE ARGUMENT,And through the town their dreams and omens fly;
751,THE ARGUMENT,"So the Sibylline leaves were blown about,"
752,THE ARGUMENT,Disjointed scraps of fate involved in doubt;
753,THE ARGUMENT,"So idle dreams, the journals of the night,"
754,THE ARGUMENT,"Are right and wrong by turns, and mingle wrong with right.-"
755,THE ARGUMENT,"Some champions for the rights that prop the crown,"
756,THE ARGUMENT,"Some sturdy patriots, sworn to pull them down;"
757,THE ARGUMENT,"Some neutral powers, with secret forces fraught,"
758,THE ARGUMENT,"Wishing for war, but willing to be bought:"
759,THE ARGUMENT,"While some to every side and party go,"
760,THE ARGUMENT,"Shift every friend, and join with every foe;"
761,THE ARGUMENT,"Like sturdy rogues in privateers, they strike"
762,THE ARGUMENT,"This side and that, the foes of both alike;"
763,THE ARGUMENT,"A traitor-crew, who thrive in troubled times,"
764,THE ARGUMENT,"Fear'd for their force, and courted for their crimes."
765,THE ARGUMENT,"Chief to the prosperous side the numbers sail,"
766,THE ARGUMENT,"Fickle and false, they veer with every gale;"
767,THE ARGUMENT,As birds that migrate from a freezing shore
768,THE ARGUMENT,"In search of warmer climes, come skimming o'er,"
769,THE ARGUMENT,Some bold adventurers first prepare to try
770,THE ARGUMENT,The doubtful sunshine of the distant sky;
771,THE ARGUMENT,But soon the growing Summer's certain sun
772,THE ARGUMENT,"Wins more and more, till all at last are won:"
773,THE ARGUMENT,"So, on the early prospect of disgrace,"
774,THE ARGUMENT,Fly in vast troops this apprehensive race;
775,THE ARGUMENT,"Instinctive tribes! their failing food they dread,"
776,THE ARGUMENT,"And buy, with timely change, their future bread."
777,THE ARGUMENT,"Such are our guides; how many a peaceful head,"
778,THE ARGUMENT,"Born to be still, have they to wrangling led!"
779,THE ARGUMENT,"How many an honest zealot stol'n from trade,"
780,THE ARGUMENT,And factious tools of pious pastors made!
781,THE ARGUMENT,"With clews like these they thread the maze of state,"
782,THE ARGUMENT,"These oracles explore, to learn our fate;"
783,THE ARGUMENT,"Pleased with the guides who can so well deceive,"
784,THE ARGUMENT,Who cannot lie so fast as they believe.
785,THE ARGUMENT,"Oft lend I, loth, to some sage friend an ear,"
786,THE ARGUMENT,(For we who will not speak are doom'd to hear);
787,THE ARGUMENT,"While he, bewilder'd, tells his anxious thought,"
788,THE ARGUMENT,"Infectious fear from tainted scribblers caught,"
789,THE ARGUMENT,"Or idiot hope; for each his mind assails,"
790,THE ARGUMENT,As LLOYD'S court-light or STOCKDALE'S gloom prevails.
791,THE ARGUMENT,"Yet stand I patient while but one declaims,"
792,THE ARGUMENT,Or gives dull comments on the speech he maims:
793,THE ARGUMENT,"But oh! ye Muses, keep your votary's feet"
794,THE ARGUMENT,From tavern-haunts where politicians meet;
795,THE ARGUMENT,"Where rector, doctor, and attorney pause,"
796,THE ARGUMENT,"First on each parish, then each public cause:"
797,THE ARGUMENT,"Indited roads, and rates that still increase;"
798,THE ARGUMENT,"The murmuring poor, who will not fast in peace;"
799,THE ARGUMENT,"Election zeal and friendship, since declined;"
800,THE ARGUMENT,"A tax commuted, or a tithe in kind;"
801,THE ARGUMENT,The Dutch and Germans kindling into strife;
802,THE ARGUMENT,Dull port and poachers vile; the serious ills of life.
803,THE ARGUMENT,"Here comes the neighbouring Justice, pleased to guide"
804,THE ARGUMENT,"His little club, and in the chair preside."
805,THE ARGUMENT,"In private business his commands prevail,"
806,THE ARGUMENT,On public themes his reasoning turns the scale;
807,THE ARGUMENT,"Assenting silence soothes his happy ear,"
808,THE ARGUMENT,"And, in or out, his party triumphs here."
809,THE ARGUMENT,"Nor here th' infectious rage for party stops,"
810,THE ARGUMENT,But flits along from palaces to shops;
811,THE ARGUMENT,"Our weekly journals o'er the land abound,"
812,THE ARGUMENT,And spread their plague and influenzas round;
813,THE ARGUMENT,"The village, too, the peaceful, pleasant plain,"
814,THE ARGUMENT,Breeds the Whig farmer and the Tory swain;
815,THE ARGUMENT,"Brookes' and St Alban's boasts not, but, instead,"
816,THE ARGUMENT,"Stares the Red Ram, and swings the Rodney's Head:-"
817,THE ARGUMENT,"Hither, with all a patriot's care, comes he"
818,THE ARGUMENT,Who owns the little hut that makes him free;
819,THE ARGUMENT,Whose yearly forty shillings buy the smile
820,THE ARGUMENT,"Of mightier men, and never waste the while;"
821,THE ARGUMENT,"Who feels his freehold's worth, and looks elate,"
822,THE ARGUMENT,A little prop and pillar of the state.
823,THE ARGUMENT,"Here he delights the weekly news to con,"
824,THE ARGUMENT,And mingle comments as he blunders on;
825,THE ARGUMENT,"To swallow all their varying authors teach,"
826,THE ARGUMENT,"To spell a title, and confound a speech:"
827,THE ARGUMENT,"Till with a muddled mind he quits the news,"
828,THE ARGUMENT,And claims his nation's licence to abuse;
829,THE ARGUMENT,"Then joins the cry, ""That all the courtly race"
830,THE ARGUMENT,"Are venal candidates for power and place;"""
831,THE ARGUMENT,"Yet feels some joy, amid the general vice,"
832,THE ARGUMENT,That his own vote will bring its wonted price.
833,THE ARGUMENT,"These are the ills the teeming Press supplies,"
834,THE ARGUMENT,The pois'nous springs from learning's fountain rise;
835,THE ARGUMENT,"Not there the wise alone their entrance find,"
836,THE ARGUMENT,Imparting useful light to mortals blind;
837,THE ARGUMENT,"But, blind themselves, these erring guides hold out"
838,THE ARGUMENT,Alluring lights to lead us far about;
839,THE ARGUMENT,"Screen'd by such means, here Scandal whets her quill,"
840,THE ARGUMENT,"Here Slander shoots unseen, whene'er she will;"
841,THE ARGUMENT,"Here Fraud and Falsehood labour to deceive,"
842,THE ARGUMENT,"And Folly aids them both, impatient to believe."
843,THE ARGUMENT,"Such, sons of Britain! are the guides ye trust;"
844,THE ARGUMENT,"So wise their counsel, their reports so just!-"
845,THE ARGUMENT,"Yet, though we cannot call their morals pure,"
846,THE ARGUMENT,"Their judgment nice, or their decisions sure;"
847,THE ARGUMENT,"Merit they have to mightier works unknown,"
848,THE ARGUMENT,"A style, a manner, and a fate their own."
849,THE ARGUMENT,"We, who for longer fame with labour strive,"
850,THE ARGUMENT,Are pain'd to keep our sickly works alive;
851,THE ARGUMENT,"Studious we toil, with patient care refine,"
852,THE ARGUMENT,Nor let our love protect one languid line.
853,THE ARGUMENT,"Severe ourselves, at last our works appear,"
854,THE ARGUMENT,"When, ah! we find our readers more severe;"
855,THE ARGUMENT,"For, after all our care and pains, how few"
856,THE ARGUMENT,"Acquire applause, or keep it if they do!"
857,THE ARGUMENT,"Not so these sheets, ordain'd to happier fate,"
858,THE ARGUMENT,"Praised through their day, and but that day their date;"
859,THE ARGUMENT,Their careless authors only strive to join
860,THE ARGUMENT,As many words as make an even line;
861,THE ARGUMENT,As many lines as fill a row complete;
862,THE ARGUMENT,As many rows as furnish up a sheet:
863,THE ARGUMENT,"From side to side, with ready types they run,"
864,THE ARGUMENT,"The measure's ended, and the work is done;"
865,THE ARGUMENT,"Oh, born with ease, how envied and how blest!"
866,THE ARGUMENT,"Your fate to-day and your to-morrow's rest,"
867,THE ARGUMENT,"To you all readers turn, and they can look"
868,THE ARGUMENT,"Pleased on a paper, who abhor a book;"
869,THE ARGUMENT,"Those who ne'er deign'd their Bible to peruse,"
870,THE ARGUMENT,Would think it hard to be denied their News;
871,THE ARGUMENT,"Sinners and saints, the wisest with the weak,"
872,THE ARGUMENT,"Here mingle tastes, and one amusement seek;"
873,THE ARGUMENT,"This, like the public inn, provides a treat,"
874,THE ARGUMENT,Where each promiscuous guest sits down to eat;
875,THE ARGUMENT,"And such this mental food, as we may call"
876,THE ARGUMENT,"Something to all men, and to some men all."
877,THE ARGUMENT,"Next, in what rare production shall we trace"
878,THE ARGUMENT,Such various subjects in so small a space?
879,THE ARGUMENT,As the first ship upon the waters bore
880,THE ARGUMENT,Incongruous kinds who never met before;
881,THE ARGUMENT,Or as some curious virtuoso joins
882,THE ARGUMENT,"In one small room, moths, minerals, and coins,"
883,THE ARGUMENT,"Birds, beasts, and fishes; nor refuses place"
884,THE ARGUMENT,"To serpents, toads, and all the reptile race;"
885,THE ARGUMENT,"So here compress'd within a single sheet,"
886,THE ARGUMENT,"Great things and small, the mean and mighty meet."
887,THE ARGUMENT,"'Tis this which makes all Europe's business known,"
888,THE ARGUMENT,Yet here a private man may place his own:
889,THE ARGUMENT,"And, where he reads of Lords and Commons, he"
890,THE ARGUMENT,May tell their honours that he sells rappee.
891,THE ARGUMENT,Add next th' amusement which the motley page
892,THE ARGUMENT,Affords to either sex and every age:
893,THE ARGUMENT,"Lo! where it comes before the cheerful fire,-"
894,THE ARGUMENT,Damps from the press in smoky curls aspire
895,THE ARGUMENT,"(As from the earth the sun exhales the dew),"
896,THE ARGUMENT,Ere we can read the wonders that ensue:
897,THE ARGUMENT,Then eager every eye surveys the part
898,THE ARGUMENT,That brings its favourite subject to the heart;
899,THE ARGUMENT,"Grave politicians look for facts alone,"
900,THE ARGUMENT,And gravely add conjectures of their own:
901,THE ARGUMENT,"The sprightly nymph, who never broke her rest"
902,THE ARGUMENT,"For tottering crowns or mighty lands oppress'd,"
903,THE ARGUMENT,"Finds broils and battles, but neglects them all"
904,THE ARGUMENT,"For songs and suits, a birth-day, or a ball:"
905,THE ARGUMENT,The keen warm man o'erlooks each idle tale
906,THE ARGUMENT,"For ""Monies wanted,"" and ""Estates on Sale;"""
907,THE ARGUMENT,"While some with equal minds to all attend,"
908,THE ARGUMENT,"Pleased with each part, and grieved to find an end."
909,THE ARGUMENT,"So charm the news; but we who, far from town,"
910,THE ARGUMENT,"Wait till the postman brings the packet down,"
911,THE ARGUMENT,"Once in the week, a vacant day behold,"
912,THE ARGUMENT,"And stay for tidings, till they're three days old:"
913,THE ARGUMENT,"That day arrives; no welcome post appears,"
914,THE ARGUMENT,But the dull morn a sullen aspect wears:
915,THE ARGUMENT,"We meet, but ah! without our wonted smile,"
916,THE ARGUMENT,"To talk of headaches, and complain of bile;"
917,THE ARGUMENT,"Sullen we ponder o'er a dull repast,"
918,THE ARGUMENT,Nor feast the body while the mind must fast.
919,THE ARGUMENT,"A master passion is the love of news,"
920,THE ARGUMENT,"Not music so commands, nor so the Muse:"
921,THE ARGUMENT,"Give poets claret, they grow idle soon;"
922,THE ARGUMENT,Feed the musician and he's out of tune;
923,THE ARGUMENT,"But the sick mind, of this disease possess'd,"
924,THE ARGUMENT,"Flies from all cure, and sickens when at rest."
925,THE ARGUMENT,"Now sing, my Muse, what various parts compose"
926,THE ARGUMENT,These rival sheets of politics and prose.
927,THE ARGUMENT,"First, from each brother's hoard a part they draw,"
928,THE ARGUMENT,A mutual theft that never feared a law;
929,THE ARGUMENT,"Whate'er they gain, to each man's portion fall,"
930,THE ARGUMENT,"And read it once, you read it through them all:"
931,THE ARGUMENT,"For this their runners ramble day and night,"
932,THE ARGUMENT,To drag each lurking deed to open light;
933,THE ARGUMENT,"For daily bread the dirty trade they ply,"
934,THE ARGUMENT,"Coin their fresh tales, and live upon the lie:"
935,THE ARGUMENT,"Like bees for honey, forth for news they spring,-"
936,THE ARGUMENT,Industrious creatures! ever on the wing;
937,THE ARGUMENT,"Home to their several cells they bear the store,"
938,THE ARGUMENT,"Cull'd of all kinds, then roam abroad for more."
939,THE ARGUMENT,"No anxious virgin flies to ""fair Tweed-side;"""
940,THE ARGUMENT,No injured husband mourns his faithless bride;
941,THE ARGUMENT,No duel dooms the fiery youth to bleed;
942,THE ARGUMENT,But through the town transpires each vent'rous deed.
943,THE ARGUMENT,Should some fair frail one drive her prancing pair
944,THE ARGUMENT,Where rival peers contend to please the fair;
945,THE ARGUMENT,"When, with new force, she aids her conquering eyes,"
946,THE ARGUMENT,"And beauty decks, with all that beauty buys:"
947,THE ARGUMENT,"Quickly we learn whose heart her influence feels,"
948,THE ARGUMENT,Whose acres melt before her glowing wheels.
949,THE ARGUMENT,"To these a thousand idle themes succeed,"
950,THE ARGUMENT,"Deeds of all kinds, and comments to each deed."
951,THE ARGUMENT,"Here stocks, the state barometers, we view,"
952,THE ARGUMENT,That rise or fall by causes known to few;
953,THE ARGUMENT,Promotion's ladder who goes up or down;
954,THE ARGUMENT,"Who wed, or who seduced, amuse the town;"
955,THE ARGUMENT,What new-born heir has made his father blest;
956,THE ARGUMENT,"What heir exults, his father now at rest;"
957,THE ARGUMENT,"That ample list the Tyburn-herald gives,"
958,THE ARGUMENT,"And each known knave, who still for Tyburn lives."
959,THE ARGUMENT,"So grows the work, and now the printer tries"
960,THE ARGUMENT,"His powers no more, but leans on his allies."
961,THE ARGUMENT,"When lo! the advertising tribe succeed,"
962,THE ARGUMENT,"Pay to be read, yet find but few will read;"
963,THE ARGUMENT,"And chief th' illustrious race, whose drops and pills"
964,THE ARGUMENT,Have patent powers to vanquish human ills:
965,THE ARGUMENT,"These, with their cures, a constant aid remain,"
966,THE ARGUMENT,To bless the pale composer's fertile brain;
967,THE ARGUMENT,"Fertile it is, but still the noblest soil"
968,THE ARGUMENT,"Requires some pause, some intervals from toil;"
969,THE ARGUMENT,And they at least a certain ease obtain
970,THE ARGUMENT,"From Katterfelto's skill, and Graham's glowing strain."
971,THE ARGUMENT,"I too must aid, and pay to see my name"
972,THE ARGUMENT,Hung in these dirty avenues to fame;
973,THE ARGUMENT,"Nor pay in vain, if aught the Muse has seen,"
974,THE ARGUMENT,"And sung, could make these avenues more clean;"
975,THE ARGUMENT,"Could stop one slander ere it found its way,"
976,THE ARGUMENT,And give to public scorn its helpless prey.
977,THE ARGUMENT,"By the same aid, the Stage invites her friends,"
978,THE ARGUMENT,And kindly tells the banquet she intends;
979,THE ARGUMENT,"Thither from real life the many run,"
980,THE ARGUMENT,"With Siddons weep, or laugh with Abingdon;"
981,THE ARGUMENT,"Pleased in fictitious joy or grief, to see"
982,THE ARGUMENT,The mimic passion with their own agree;
983,THE ARGUMENT,To steal a few enchanted hours away
984,THE ARGUMENT,"From self, and drop the curtain on the day."
985,THE ARGUMENT,But who can steal from self that wretched wight
986,THE ARGUMENT,Whose darling work is tried some fatal night?
987,THE ARGUMENT,"Most wretched man! when, bane to every bliss,"
988,THE ARGUMENT,He hears the serpent-critic's rising hiss;
989,THE ARGUMENT,Then groans succeed; nor traitors on the wheel
990,THE ARGUMENT,"Can feel like him, or have such pangs to feel."
991,THE ARGUMENT,Nor end they here:  next day he reads his fall
992,THE ARGUMENT,In every paper; critics are they all:
993,THE ARGUMENT,"He sees his branded name with wild affright,"
994,THE ARGUMENT,And hears again the cat-calls of the night.
995,THE ARGUMENT,Such help the STAGE affords:  a larger space
996,THE ARGUMENT,Is fill'd by PUFFS and all the puffing race.
997,THE ARGUMENT,"Physic had once alone the lofty style,"
998,THE ARGUMENT,"The well-known boast, that ceased to raise a smile:"
999,THE ARGUMENT,"Now all the province of that tribe invade,"
1000,THE ARGUMENT,And we abound in quacks of every trade.
1001,THE ARGUMENT,"The simple barber, once an honest name,"
1002,THE ARGUMENT,"Cervantes founded, Fielding raised his fame:"
1003,THE ARGUMENT,"Barber no more--a gay perfumer comes,"
1004,THE ARGUMENT,On whose soft cheek his own cosmetic blooms;
1005,THE ARGUMENT,"Here he appears, each simple mind to move,"
1006,THE ARGUMENT,"And advertises beauty, grace, and love."
1007,THE ARGUMENT,"""Come, faded belles, who would your youth renew,"
1008,THE ARGUMENT,And learn the wonders of Olympian dew;
1009,THE ARGUMENT,"Restore the roses that begin to faint,"

1011,THE ARGUMENT,"Your former features, airs, and arts assume,"
1012,THE ARGUMENT,"Circassian virtues, with Circassian bloom."
1013,THE ARGUMENT,"Come, battered beaux, whose locks are turned to gray,"
1014,THE ARGUMENT,And crop Discretion's lying badge away;
1015,THE ARGUMENT,"Read where they vend these smart engaging things,"
1016,THE ARGUMENT,These flaxen frontlets with elastic springs;
1017,THE ARGUMENT,"No female eye the fair deception sees,"
1018,THE ARGUMENT,"Not Nature's self so natural as these."""
1019,THE ARGUMENT,"Such are their arts, but not confined to them,"
1020,THE ARGUMENT,The muse impartial most her sons condemn:
1021,THE ARGUMENT,"For they, degenerate! join the venal throng,"
1022,THE ARGUMENT,And puff a lazy Pegasus along:
1023,THE ARGUMENT,"More guilty these, by Nature less design'd"
1024,THE ARGUMENT,For little arts that suit the vulgar kind.
1025,THE ARGUMENT,"That barbers' boys, who would to trade advance,"
1026,THE ARGUMENT,Wish us to call them smart Friseurs from France:
1027,THE ARGUMENT,"That he who builds a chop-house, on his door"
1028,THE ARGUMENT,"Paints ""The true old original Blue Boar!""-"
1029,THE ARGUMENT,"These are the arts by which a thousand live,"
1030,THE ARGUMENT,"Where Truth may smile, and Justice may forgive:-"
1031,THE ARGUMENT,"But when, amidst this rabble rout, we find"
1032,THE ARGUMENT,A puffing poet to his honour blind;
1033,THE ARGUMENT,Who slily drops quotations all about
1034,THE ARGUMENT,"Packet or post, and points their merit out;"
1035,THE ARGUMENT,"Who advertises what reviewers say,"
1036,THE ARGUMENT,With sham editions every second day;
1037,THE ARGUMENT,"Who dares not trust his praises out of sight,"
1038,THE ARGUMENT,But hurries into fame with all his might;
1039,THE ARGUMENT,"Although the verse some transient praise obtains,"
1040,THE ARGUMENT,Contempt is all the anxious poet gains.
1041,THE ARGUMENT,"Now Puffs exhausted, Advertisements past,"
1042,THE ARGUMENT,Their Correspondents stand exposed at last;
1043,THE ARGUMENT,"These are a numerous tribe, to fame unknown,"
1044,THE ARGUMENT,Who for the public good forego their own;
1045,THE ARGUMENT,"Who volunteers in paper-war engage,"
1046,THE ARGUMENT,With double portion of their party's rage:
1047,THE ARGUMENT,"Such are the Bruti, Decii, who appear"
1048,THE ARGUMENT,Wooing the printer for admission here;
1049,THE ARGUMENT,Whose generous souls can condescend to pray
1050,THE ARGUMENT,For leave to throw their precious time away.
1051,THE ARGUMENT,Oh! cruel WOODFALL! when a patriot draws
1052,THE ARGUMENT,"His gray-goose quill in his dear country's cause,"
1053,THE ARGUMENT,"To vex and maul a ministerial race,"
1054,THE ARGUMENT,Can thy stern soul refuse the champion place?
1055,THE ARGUMENT,Alas! thou know'st not with what anxious heart
1056,THE ARGUMENT,He longs his best-loved labours to impart;
1057,THE ARGUMENT,"How he has sent them to thy brethren round,"
1058,THE ARGUMENT,And still the same unkind reception found:
1059,THE ARGUMENT,"At length indignant will he damn the state,"
1060,THE ARGUMENT,"Turn to his trade, and leave us to our fate."
1061,THE ARGUMENT,"These Roman souls, like Rome's great sons, are known"
1062,THE ARGUMENT,To live in cells on labours of their own.
1063,THE ARGUMENT,"Thus Milo, could we see the noble chief,"
1064,THE ARGUMENT,"Feeds, for his country's good, on legs of beef:"
1065,THE ARGUMENT,"Camillus copies deeds for sordid pay,"
1066,THE ARGUMENT,Yet fights the public battles twice a-day:

1068,THE ARGUMENT,"Scroll'd on the bar-board, swinging with the door:"
1069,THE ARGUMENT,"Where, tippling punch, grave Cato's self you'll see,"
1070,THE ARGUMENT,And Amor Patriae vending smuggled tea.
1071,THE ARGUMENT,"Last in these ranks, and least, their art's disgrace,"
1072,THE ARGUMENT,Neglected stand the Muses' meanest race;
1073,THE ARGUMENT,"Scribblers who court contempt, whose verse the eye"
1074,THE ARGUMENT,"Disdainful views, and glances swiftly by:"
1075,THE ARGUMENT,"This Poet's Corner is the place they choose,"

1086,THE ARGUMENT,"Hid in your flow'ry path, and cry ""Beware!"""
1087,THE ARGUMENT,"Thoughtless of ill, and to the future blind,"
1088,THE ARGUMENT,A sudden couplet rushes on your mind;

1090,THE ARGUMENT,And read your first-born work a thousand times;
1091,THE ARGUMENT,"Th'infection spreads, your couplet grows apace,"
1092,THE ARGUMENT,Stanzas to Delia's dog or Celia's face:
