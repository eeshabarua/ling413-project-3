67,MY LORD;,MY LORD;
68,MY LORD;,
69,MY LORD;,That the longest Poem in this Collection was honoured by the notice of
70,MY LORD;,"your Lordship’s Right Honourable and ever-valued Relation, Mr. Fox; that"
71,MY LORD;,it should be the last which engaged his attention; and that some parts
72,MY LORD;,of it were marked with his approbation; are circumstances productive of
73,MY LORD;,"better hopes of ultimate success, than I had dared to entertain before"
74,MY LORD;,"I was gratified with a knowledge of them: And the hope thus raised,"
75,MY LORD;,leads me to ask permission that I may dedicate this Book to your
76,MY LORD;,"Lordship, to whom that truly great and greatly lamented Personage was so"
77,MY LORD;,"nearly allied in family, so closely bound in affection, and in whose"
78,MY LORD;,mind presides the same critical taste which he exerted to the delight of
79,MY LORD;,"all who heard him. He doubtless united with his unequalled abilities, a"
80,MY LORD;,"fund of good-nature; and this possibly led him to speak favourably of,"
81,MY LORD;,"and give satisfaction to writers, with whose productions he might not be"
82,MY LORD;,entirely satisfied; nor must I allow myself to suppose his desire of
83,MY LORD;,"obliging was withholden, when he honoured any effort of mine with his"
84,MY LORD;,"approbation: But, my Lord, as there was discrimination in the opinion he"
85,MY LORD;,gave; as he did not veil indifference for insipid mediocrity of
86,MY LORD;,composition under any general expression of cool approval; I allow
87,MY LORD;,myself to draw a favourable conclusion from the verdict of One who had
88,MY LORD;,"the superiority of intellect few would dispute, which he made manifest"
89,MY LORD;,"by a force of eloquence peculiar to himself; whose excellent judgement,"
90,MY LORD;,"no one of his friends found cause to distrust, and whose acknowledged"
91,MY LORD;,candour no enemy had the temerity to deny.
92,MY LORD;,
93,MY LORD;,"With such encouragement, I present my Book to your Lordship: the Account"
94,MY LORD;,"of the _Life and Writings of Lopez de Vega_, has taught me what I am to"
95,MY LORD;,"expect; I there perceive how your Lordship can write, and am there"
96,MY LORD;,"taught how you can judge of writers: my faults, however numerous, I know"
97,MY LORD;,"will none of them escape through inattention, nor will any merit be lost"
98,MY LORD;,for want of discernment: My verses are before him who has written
99,MY LORD;,"elegantly, who has judged with accuracy, and who has given unequivocal"
100,MY LORD;,"proof of abilities in a work of difficulty;--a translation of poetry,"
101,MY LORD;,"which few persons in this kingdom are able to read, and in the"
102,MY LORD;,"estimation of talents not hitherto justly appreciated: In this view, I"
103,MY LORD;,"cannot but feel some apprehension: but I know also, that your Lordship"
104,MY LORD;,is apprised of the great difficulty of writing well; that you will make
105,MY LORD;,"much allowance for failures, if not too frequently repeated; and, as"
106,MY LORD;,"you can accurately discern, so you will readily approve, all the better"
107,MY LORD;,"and more happy efforts of one, who places the highest value upon your"
108,MY LORD;,"Lordship’s approbation; and who has the honour to be,"

123,_PREFACE._,_PREFACE._
124,_PREFACE._,
125,_PREFACE._,
126,_PREFACE._,"About twenty-five years since, was published a Poem called _The"
127,_PREFACE._,"Library_; which, in no long time, was followed by two others, _The"
128,_PREFACE._,"Village_, and _The Newspaper_: These, with a few alterations and"
129,_PREFACE._,"additions, are here reprinted; and are accompanied by a Poem of greater"
130,_PREFACE._,"length, and several shorter attempts, now, for the first time, before"
131,_PREFACE._,"the Public; whose reception of them creates in their Author, something"
132,_PREFACE._,"more than common solicitude, because he conceives that, with the"
133,_PREFACE._,"judgement to be formed of these latter productions, upon whatever may be"
134,_PREFACE._,"found intrinsically meritorious or defective, there will be united an"
135,_PREFACE._,"enquiry into the relative degree of praise or blame, which they may be"
136,_PREFACE._,"thought to deserve, when compared with the more early attempts of the"
137,_PREFACE._,same Writer.
138,_PREFACE._,
139,_PREFACE._,"And certainly, were it the principal employment of a man’s life, to"
140,_PREFACE._,"compose Verses, it might seem reasonable to expect, that he would"
141,_PREFACE._,"continue to improve as long as he continued to live; though, even then,"
142,_PREFACE._,"there is some doubt whether such improvement would follow, and perhaps"
143,_PREFACE._,"proof might be adduced to shew, it would not: but when to this “_idle"
144,_PREFACE._,"trade_,” is added some “_calling_,” with superior claims upon his time"
145,_PREFACE._,"and attention, his progress in the art of Versification will probably be"
146,_PREFACE._,"in proportion neither to the years he has lived, nor even to the"
147,_PREFACE._,attempts he has made.
148,_PREFACE._,
149,_PREFACE._,"While composing the first-published of these Poems, the Author was"
150,_PREFACE._,honoured with the notice and assisted by the advice of the _Right
151,_PREFACE._,"Honourable_ EDMUND BURKE: Part of it was written in his presence, and"
152,_PREFACE._,"the whole submitted to his judgement; receiving, in its progress, the"
153,_PREFACE._,benefit of his correction: I hope therefore to obtain pardon of the
154,_PREFACE._,"reader, if I eagerly seize the occasion, and, after so long a silence,"
155,_PREFACE._,endeavour to express a grateful sense of the benefits I have received
156,_PREFACE._,"from this Gentleman, who was solicitous for my more essential interests,"
157,_PREFACE._,as well as benevolently anxious for my credit as a writer.
158,_PREFACE._,
159,_PREFACE._,I will not enter upon the subject of his extraordinary abilities; it
160,_PREFACE._,"would be vanity, it would be weakness in me to believe that I could"
161,_PREFACE._,make them better known or more admired than they now are; but of his
162,_PREFACE._,"private worth, of his wishes to do good, of his affability and"
163,_PREFACE._,condescension; his readiness to lend assistance when he knew it was
164,_PREFACE._,"wanted, and his delight to give praise where he thought it was deserved;"
165,_PREFACE._,of these I may write with some propriety: all know that his powers were
166,_PREFACE._,"vast, his acquirements various, and I take leave to add, that he applied"
167,_PREFACE._,"them, with unremitted attention, to those objects which he believed"
168,_PREFACE._,tended to the honour and welfare of his country; but it may not be so
169,_PREFACE._,generally understood that he was ever assiduous in the more private
170,_PREFACE._,"duties of a benevolent nature, that he delighted to give encouragement"
171,_PREFACE._,to any promise of ability and assistance to any appearance of desert; to
172,_PREFACE._,"what purposes he employed his pen, and with what eloquence he spake in"
173,_PREFACE._,"the senate, will be told by many, who yet may be ignorant of the solid"
174,_PREFACE._,instruction as well as the fascinating pleasantry found in his common
175,_PREFACE._,"conversation, among his friends, and his affectionate manners, amiable"
176,_PREFACE._,"disposition, and zeal for their happiness, which he manifested in the"
177,_PREFACE._,hours of retirement with his family.
178,_PREFACE._,
179,_PREFACE._,To this Gentleman I was indebted for my knowledge of _Sir_ JOSHUA
180,_PREFACE._,"REYNOLDS, who was as well known to his friends, for his perpetual fund"
181,_PREFACE._,"of good-humour, and his unceasing wishes to oblige, as he was to the"
182,_PREFACE._,"public, for the extraordinary productions of his pencil and his pen: By"
183,_PREFACE._,"him I was favoured with an introduction to _Doctor_ JOHNSON, who"
184,_PREFACE._,"honoured me with his notice and assisted me, as Mr. BOSWELL has told,"
185,_PREFACE._,with Remarks and Emendations for a Poem I was about to publish[1]: The
186,_PREFACE._,"_Doctor_ had been often wearied by applications, and did not readily"
187,_PREFACE._,"comply with requests, for his opinion; not from any unwillingness to"
188,_PREFACE._,"oblige, but from a painful contention in his mind, between a desire of"
189,_PREFACE._,"giving pleasure and a determination to speak truth. No man can, I think,"
190,_PREFACE._,publish a work without some expectation of satisfying those who are to
191,_PREFACE._,"judge of its merit: but I can, with the utmost regard to veracity, speak"
192,_PREFACE._,"my fears, as predominating over every pre-indulged thought of a more"
193,_PREFACE._,"favourable nature, when I was told that a judge so discerning, had"
194,_PREFACE._,"consented to read and give his opinion of the VILLAGE, the poem I had"
195,_PREFACE._,prepared for publication. The time of suspence was not long protracted;
196,_PREFACE._,"I was soon favoured with a few words from _Sir_ JOSHUA, who"
197,_PREFACE._,"observed,--‘If I knew how cautious _Doctor_ JOHNSON was in giving"
198,_PREFACE._,"commendation, I should be well satisfied with the portion dealt to me in"
199,_PREFACE._,his letter.’--Of that letter the following is a copy:
200,_PREFACE._,
201,“SIR;,“SIR;
202,“SIR;,
203,“SIR;,“I have sent you back Mr. CRABBE’s Poem; which I read with great
204,“SIR;,"delight. It is original, vigorous, and elegant.--The alterations"
205,“SIR;,"which I have made, I do not require him to adopt; for, my lines"
206,“SIR;,"are, perhaps, not often better [than] his own: but he may take mine"
207,“SIR;,"and his own together, and perhaps, between them, produce something"
208,“SIR;,better than either.--He is not to think his copy wantonly defaced:
209,“SIR;,"A wet sponge will wash all the red lines away, and leave the pages"
210,“SIR;,clean.--His Dedication[2] will be least liked: it were better to
211,“SIR;,contract it into a short sprightly Address.--I do not doubt of Mr.
212,“SIR;,CRABBE’s success.
213,“SIR;,
214,“SIR;,"“I am, SIR, your most humble servant,"
215,“SIR;,
216,“SIR;,“_March 4 1783._”                           “SAM: JOHNSON.”
217,“SIR;,
218,“SIR;,"That I was fully satisfied, my readers will do me the justice to"
219,“SIR;,"believe; and I hope they will pardon me, if there should appear to them"
220,“SIR;,any impropriety in publishing the favourable opinion expressed in a
221,“SIR;,"private letter; they will judge, and truly, that by so doing I wish to"
222,“SIR;,"bespeak their good opinion, but have no design of extorting their"
223,“SIR;,"applause: I would not hazard an appearance so ostentatious, to gratify"
224,“SIR;,"my vanity, but, I venture to do it, in compliance with my fears."
225,“SIR;,
226,“SIR;,After these was published the NEWSPAPER: it had not the advantage of
227,“SIR;,"such previous criticism from my friends, nor perhaps so much of my own"
228,“SIR;,attention as I ought to have given to it; but the impression was
229,“SIR;,"disposed of, and I will not pay so little respect to the judgement of my"
230,“SIR;,"readers, as now to suppress, what they then approved."
231,“SIR;,
232,“SIR;,"Since the publication of this Poem, more than twenty years have elapsed,"
233,“SIR;,"and I am not without apprehension, lest so long a silence should be"
234,“SIR;,construed into a blameable neglect of my own interest which those
235,“SIR;,"excellent friends were desirous of promoting; or what is yet worse, into"
236,“SIR;,a want of gratitude for their assistance; since it becomes me to
237,“SIR;,"suppose, they considered these first attempts as promises of better"
238,“SIR;,"things, and their favours as stimulants to future exertion; and here,"
239,“SIR;,"be the construction put upon my apparent negligence what it _may_, let"
240,“SIR;,me not suppress my testimony to the liberality of those who are looked
241,“SIR;,"up to, as patrons and encouragers of literary merit, or indeed of merit"
242,“SIR;,"of any kind: their patronage has never been refused, I conceive, when it"
243,“SIR;,"has been reasonably expected or modestly required, and it would be"
244,“SIR;,"difficult, probably, to instance, in these times and in this country,"
245,“SIR;,"any one who merited or was supposed to merit assistance, but who"
246,“SIR;,nevertheless languished in obscurity or necessity for want of it; unless
247,“SIR;,"in those cases, where it was prevented by the resolution of impatient"
248,“SIR;,"pride, or wearied by the solicitations of determined profligacy.--And"
249,“SIR;,"while the subject is before me, I am unwilling to pass silently over the"
250,“SIR;,"debt of gratitude which I owe to the memory of two deceased noblemen,"
251,“SIR;,"_His Grace the late Duke of_ RUTLAND, and _The Right Honourable the"
252,“SIR;,Lord_ THURLOW: sensible of the honour done me by their notice and the
253,“SIR;,"benefits received from them, I trust this acknowledgement will be"
254,“SIR;,"imputed to its only motive, a grateful sense of their favours."
255,“SIR;,
256,“SIR;,Upon this subject I could dwell with much pleasure; but to give a reason
257,“SIR;,"for that appearance of neglect, as it is more difficult, so happily it"
258,“SIR;,"is less required: In truth I have, for many years, intended a"
259,“SIR;,"republication of these Poems, as soon as I should be able to join with"
260,“SIR;,"them, such other of later date, as might not deprive me of the little"
261,“SIR;,"credit, the former had obtained. Long indeed has this purpose been"
262,“SIR;,"procrastinated: and if the duties of a profession, not before pressing"
263,“SIR;,"upon me; if the claims of a situation, at that time untried; if"
264,“SIR;,"diffidence of my own judgement, and the loss of my earliest friends,"
265,“SIR;,"will not sufficiently account for my delay, I must rely upon the"
266,“SIR;,"good-nature of my reader, that he will let them avail as far as he can,"
267,“SIR;,and find an additional apology in my fears of his censure.
268,“SIR;,
269,“SIR;,"These fears being so prevalent with me, I determined not to publish any"
270,“SIR;,"thing more, unless I could first obtain the sanction of such opinion, as"
271,“SIR;,"I might with some confidence rely upon: I looked for a friend who,"
272,“SIR;,"having the discerning taste of _Mr._ BURKE, and the critical sagacity of"
273,“SIR;,"_Doctor_ JOHNSON, would bestow upon my MS. the attention requisite to"
274,“SIR;,"form his opinion, and would then favour me with the result of his"
275,“SIR;,observations: and it was my singular good fortune to gain such
276,“SIR;,"assistance; the opinion of a critic so qualified, and a friend so"
277,“SIR;,disposed to favour me. I had been honoured by an introduction to the
278,“SIR;,"_Right Honourable_ CHARLES-JAMES FOX, some years before, at the seat of"
279,“SIR;,"_Mr._ BURKE; and being again with him, I received a promise that he"
280,“SIR;,"would peruse any work I might send to him previous to its publication,"
281,“SIR;,"and would give me his opinion. At that time, I did not think myself"
282,“SIR;,"sufficiently prepared; and when, afterwards, I had collected some Poems"
283,“SIR;,"for his inspection, I found my Right Honourable Friend engaged by the"
284,“SIR;,"affairs of a great empire, and struggling with the inveteracy of a fatal"
285,“SIR;,"disease: at such time, upon such mind, ever disposed to oblige as that"
286,“SIR;,"mind was, I could not obtrude the petty business of criticizing verses:"
287,“SIR;,"but he remembered the promise he had kindly given, and repeated an"
288,“SIR;,"offer, which though I had not presumed to expect, I was happy to"
289,“SIR;,"receive. A copy of the Poems, now first published, was immediately sent"
290,“SIR;,"to him, and (as I have the information from _Lord_ HOLLAND, and his"
291,“SIR;,Lordship’s permission to inform my Readers) the Poem which I have named
292,“SIR;,"THE PARISH REGISTER, was heard by Mr. FOX, and it excited interest"
293,“SIR;,"enough, by some of its parts, to gain for me the benefit of his"
294,“SIR;,"judgement upon the whole: Whatever he approved, the Reader will readily"
295,“SIR;,"believe, I have carefully retained; the parts he disliked are totally"
296,“SIR;,"expunged, and others are substituted, which I hope resemble those, more"
297,“SIR;,conformable to the taste of so admirable a judge; nor can I deny myself
298,“SIR;,"the melancholy satisfaction of adding that this Poem, (and more"
299,“SIR;,"especially the story of _Phœbe Dawson_[3], with some parts of the second"
300,“SIR;,"book) were the last compositions of their kind, that engaged and amused"
301,“SIR;,"the capacious, the candid, the benevolent mind of this great Man."
302,“SIR;,
303,“SIR;,The above information I owe to the favour of _The Right Honourable Lord_
304,“SIR;,"HOLLAND; nor this only, but to his Lordship I am indebted for some"
305,“SIR;,excellent remarks upon other parts of my MS. It was not indeed my good
306,“SIR;,fortune then to know that my verses were in the hands of a Nobleman who
307,“SIR;,"had given proof of his accurate judgement as a critic, and his elegance"
308,“SIR;,"as a writer, by favouring the public with an easy and spirited"
309,“SIR;,"translation of some interesting scenes of a dramatic poet, not often"
310,“SIR;,read in this kingdom: The Life of Lope de Vega was then unknown to me; I
311,“SIR;,"had, in common with many English readers, heard of him, but could not"
312,“SIR;,judge whether his far-extended reputation was caused by the sublime
313,“SIR;,"efforts of a mighty genius, or the unequalled facility of a rapid"
314,“SIR;,"composer, aided by peculiar and fortunate circumstances.--That any part"
315,“SIR;,"of my MS. was honoured by the remarks of _Lord_ HOLLAND, yields me an"
316,“SIR;,"high degree of satisfaction, and his Lordship will perceive the use I"
317,“SIR;,"have made of them, but I must feel some regret when I know to what"
318,“SIR;,"small portion they were limited; and discerning as I do, the taste and"
319,“SIR;,"judgement bestowed upon the verses of Lope de Vega, I must perceive how"
320,“SIR;,"much my own needed the assistance afforded to one, who cannot be"
321,“SIR;,sensible of the benefit he has received.
322,“SIR;,
323,“SIR;,"But how much soever I may lament the advantages lost, let me remember"
324,“SIR;,"with gratitude the helps I have obtained: With a single exception, every"
325,“SIR;,poem in the ensuing collection has been submitted to the critical
326,“SIR;,"sagacity of a gentleman, upon whose skill and candour their Author could"
327,“SIR;,"rely: to publish by advice of friends, has been severely ridiculed, and"
328,“SIR;,"that too by a poet, who probably without such advice, never made public"
329,“SIR;,"any verses of his own; in fact, it may not be easily determined who acts"
330,“SIR;,"with less discretion, the writer who is encouraged to publish his works,"
331,“SIR;,"merely by the advice of friends whom he consulted, or he who against"
332,“SIR;,advice publishes from the sole encouragement of his own opinion: these
333,“SIR;,"are deceptions to be carefully avoided, and I was happy to escape the"
334,“SIR;,"latter, by the friendly attentions of the _Reverend_ RICHARD TURNER,"
335,“SIR;,"Minister of Great Yarmouth. To this gentleman I am indebted, more than I"
336,“SIR;,"am able to describe, or than he is willing to allow, for the time he"
337,“SIR;,"has bestowed upon the attempts I have made. He is indeed, the kind of"
338,“SIR;,"critic for whom every poet should devoutly wish, and the friend whom"
339,“SIR;,every man would be happy to acquire; he has taste to discern all that is
340,“SIR;,"meritorious, and sagacity to detect whatsoever should be discarded; he"
341,“SIR;,"gives just the opinion an author’s wisdom should covet, however his"
342,“SIR;,vanity might prompt him to reject it; what altogether to expunge and
343,“SIR;,"what to improve he has repeatedly taught me, and, could I have obeyed"
344,“SIR;,"him in the latter direction as I invariably have in the former, the"
345,“SIR;,"public would have found this collection more worthy its attention, and I"
346,“SIR;,should have sought the opinion of the critic more void of apprehension.
347,“SIR;,
348,“SIR;,"But whatever I may hope or fear, whatever assistance I have had or have"
349,“SIR;,"needed, it becomes me to leave my verses to the judgement of the reader,"
350,“SIR;,without my endeavour to point out their merit or an apology for their
351,“SIR;,"defects: yet as, among the poetical attempts of one who has been for"
352,“SIR;,"many years a priest, it may seem a want of respect for the legitimate"
353,“SIR;,"objects of his study, that nothing occurs, unless it be incidentally, of"
354,“SIR;,the great subjects of Religion; so it may appear a kind of ingratitude
355,“SIR;,"in a beneficed clergyman, that he has not employed his talent (be it"
356,“SIR;,estimated as it may) to some patriotic purpose; as in celebrating the
357,“SIR;,unsubdued spirit of his countrymen in their glorious resistance of
358,“SIR;,"those enemies, who would have no peace throughout the world, except that"
359,“SIR;,which is dictated to the drooping spirit of suffering humanity by the
360,“SIR;,triumphant insolence of military success.
361,“SIR;,
362,“SIR;,"Credit will be given to me I hope, when I affirm that subjects so"
363,“SIR;,"interesting have the due weight with me, which the sacred nature of the"
364,“SIR;,one and the national importance of the other must impress upon every
365,“SIR;,"mind, not seduced into carelessness for religion, by the lethargic"
366,“SIR;,"influence of a perverted philosophy, nor into indifference for the cause"
367,“SIR;,"of our country, by hyperbolical or hypocritical professions of universal"
368,“SIR;,philanthropy; but after many efforts to satisfy myself by various trials
369,“SIR;,"on these subjects, I declined all further attempt, from a conviction"
370,“SIR;,that I should not be able to give satisfaction to my readers: poetry of
371,“SIR;,religious nature must indeed ever be clogged with almost insuperable
372,“SIR;,"difficulty: but there are doubtless to be found, poets who are well"
373,“SIR;,qualified to celebrate the unanimous and heroic spirit of our
374,“SIR;,"countrymen, and to describe in appropriate colours some of those"
375,“SIR;,"extraordinary scenes, which have been and are shifting in the face of"
376,“SIR;,"Europe, with such dreadful celerity; and to such I relinquish the duty."
377,“SIR;,
378,“SIR;,"It remains for me to give the reader, a brief view of those articles in"
379,“SIR;,"the following collection, which for the first time solicit his"
380,“SIR;,attention.
381,“SIR;,
382,“SIR;,"In the PARISH-REGISTER, he will find an endeavour once more to describe"
383,“SIR;,"Village-Manners, not by adopting the notion of pastoral simplicity or"
384,“SIR;,"assuming ideas of rustic barbarity, but by more natural views of the"
385,“SIR;,"peasantry, considered as a mixed body of persons sober or profligate,"
386,“SIR;,"and from hence, in a great measure, contented or miserable. To this more"
387,“SIR;,"general description are added, the various characters which occur in the"
388,“SIR;,"three parts of a Register; Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials."
389,“SIR;,
390,“SIR;,"If the BIRTH OF FLATTERY offer no moral, as an appendage to the fable,"
391,“SIR;,"it is hoped, that nothing of an immoral, nothing of improper tendency"
392,“SIR;,"will be imputed to a piece of poetical playfulness; in fact, genuine"
393,“SIR;,"praise, like all other species of truth, is known by its bearing full"
394,“SIR;,"investigation: it is what the giver is happy that he can justly bestow,"
395,“SIR;,and the receiver conscious that he may boldly accept; but adulation must
396,“SIR;,"ever be afraid of enquiry, and must, in proportion to their degrees of"
397,“SIR;,"moral sensibility,"
398,“SIR;,
399,“SIR;,Be shame “to him that gives and him that takes.”
400,“SIR;,
401,“SIR;,"The verses in p. 211, want a title, nor does the motto, although it gave"
402,“SIR;,"occasion to them, altogether express the sense of the writer, who meant"
403,“SIR;,"to observe that some of our best acquisitions, and some of our nobler"
404,“SIR;,"conquests are rendered ineffectual, by the passing away of opportunity"
405,“SIR;,and the changes made by time; an argument that such acquirements and
406,“SIR;,"moral habits are reserved for a state of being, in which they may have"
407,“SIR;,the uses here denied them.
408,“SIR;,
409,“SIR;,"In the story of SIR EUSTACE GREY, an attempt is made to describe the"
410,“SIR;,wanderings of a mind first irritated by the consequences of error and
411,“SIR;,"misfortune, and afterwards soothed by a species of enthusiastic"
412,“SIR;,"conversion, still keeping him insane: a task very difficult, and if the"
413,“SIR;,"presumption of the attempt may find pardon, it will not be refused to"
414,“SIR;,"the failure of the poet. It is said of our Shakespeare, respecting"
415,“SIR;,madness:
416,“SIR;,
417,“SIR;,“In that circle none dare walk but he:”--
418,“SIR;,
419,“SIR;,"yet be it granted to one, who dares not to pass the boundary fixed for"
420,“SIR;,"common minds, at least to step near to the tremendous verge and form"
421,“SIR;,some idea of the terrors that are stalking in the interdicted space.
422,“SIR;,
423,“SIR;,"“When first I had written AARON, or THE GIPSEY; I had no unfavourable"
424,“SIR;,opinion of it; and had I been collecting my verses at that time for
425,“SIR;,"publication, I should certainly have included this tale. Nine years have"
426,“SIR;,"since elapsed, and I continue to judge the same of it, thus literally"
427,“SIR;,obeying one of the directions given by the prudence of criticism to the
428,“SIR;,eagerness of the poet: but how far I may have conformed to rules of
429,“SIR;,"more importance, must be left to the less partial judgement of the"
430,“SIR;,readers.
431,“SIR;,
432,“SIR;,"The concluding poem, intitled WOMAN!, was written at the time when the"
433,“SIR;,quotation from Mr. LEDYARD was first made public; the expression has
434,“SIR;,since become hackneyed; but the sentiment is congenial with our
435,“SIR;,"feelings, and though somewhat amplified in these verses, it is hoped"
436,“SIR;,they are not so far extended as to become tedious.
437,“SIR;,
438,“SIR;,"After this brief account of his subjects, the Author leaves them to"
439,“SIR;,"their fate, not presuming to make any remarks upon the kinds of"
440,“SIR;,"versification he has chosen, or the merit of the execution; he has"
441,“SIR;,"indeed brought forward the favourable opinion of his friends, and for"
442,“SIR;,that he earnestly hopes his motives will be rightly understood; it was a
443,“SIR;,step of which he felt the advantage while he foresaw the danger; he was
444,“SIR;,"aware of the benefit, if his readers would consider him as one who puts"
445,“SIR;,on a defensive armour against hasty and determined severity; but he
446,“SIR;,"feels also the hazard, lest they should suppose be looks upon himself to"
447,“SIR;,"be guarded by his friends and so secure in the defence, that he may defy"
448,“SIR;,"the fair judgement of legal criticism: it will probably be said, ‘he has"
449,“SIR;,brought with him his testimonials to the bar of the public;’ and he
450,“SIR;,must admit the truth of the remark: but he begs leave to observe in
451,“SIR;,"reply, that, of those who bear testimonials of any kind, the greater"
452,“SIR;,"numbers feel apprehension, and not security; they are indeed so far from"
453,“SIR;,"the enjoyment of victory or the exultation of triumph, that, with all"
454,“SIR;,"they can do for themselves, with all their friends have done for them,"
455,“SIR;,"they are, like him, in dread of examination and in fear of"
456,“SIR;,disappointment.

560,BOOK I.,"Age, in its hour of languor, finds at last;"
561,BOOK I.,"What form the real picture of the Poor,"
562,BOOK I.,Demand a Song--the Muse can give no more.
563,BOOK I.,"Fled are those times, when, in harmonious strains,"
564,BOOK I.,The rustic Poet prais’d his native Plains;
565,BOOK I.,"No Shepherds now in smooth alternate verse,"
566,BOOK I.,Their Country’s beauty or their Nymphs’ rehearse;
567,BOOK I.,"Yet still for these we frame the tender strain,"
568,BOOK I.,"Still in our lays fond CORYDONS complain,"
569,BOOK I.,"And Shepherds’ boys, their amorous pains reveal,"
570,BOOK I.,"The only pains, alas! they never feel."
571,BOOK I.,"On MINCIO’s banks, in CÆSAR’s bounteous reign,"
572,BOOK I.,"If TITYRUS found the Golden Age again,"
573,BOOK I.,"Must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong,"
574,BOOK I.,Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan song?
575,BOOK I.,"From Truth and Nature shall we widely stray,"
576,BOOK I.,"Where VIRGIL, not where Fancy, leads the way?"
577,BOOK I.,"Yes, thus the Muses sing of happy Swains,"
578,BOOK I.,Because the Muses never knew their pains:
579,BOOK I.,They boast their Peasants’ pipes: but Peasants now
580,BOOK I.,Resign their pipes and plod behind the plough;
581,BOOK I.,"And few amid the Rural-tribe have time,"
582,BOOK I.,To number syllables and play with rhyme;
583,BOOK I.,"Save honest DUCK, what son of Verse could share"
584,BOOK I.,The Poet’s rapture and the Peasant’s care?
585,BOOK I.,"Or the great labours of the Field degrade,"
586,BOOK I.,With the new peril of a poorer trade?
587,BOOK I.,"From this chief cause these idle praises spring,"
588,BOOK I.,"That themes so easy, few forbear to sing;"
589,BOOK I.,"For no deep thought the trifling subjects ask,"
590,BOOK I.,To sing of Shepherds is an easy task;
591,BOOK I.,"The happy youth assumes the common strain,"
592,BOOK I.,A Nymph his mistress and himself a Swain;
593,BOOK I.,"With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer,"
594,BOOK I.,"But all, to look like her, is painted fair."
595,BOOK I.,"I grant indeed that Fields and Flocks have charms,"
596,BOOK I.,For him that gazes or for him that farms;
597,BOOK I.,But when amid such pleasing scenes I trace
598,BOOK I.,"The poor laborious natives of the place,"
599,BOOK I.,"And see the mid-day sun, with fervid ray,"
600,BOOK I.,On their bare heads and dewy temples play;
601,BOOK I.,"While some, with feebler heads and fainter hearts,"
602,BOOK I.,"Deplore their fortune, yet sustain their parts;"
603,BOOK I.,"Then shall I dare these real ills to hide,"
604,BOOK I.,In tinsel trappings of poetic pride?
605,BOOK I.,"No; cast by Fortune on a frowning coast,"
606,BOOK I.,Which neither Groves nor happy Valleys boast;
607,BOOK I.,"Where other cares than those the Muse relates,"
608,BOOK I.,And other Shepherds dwell with other mates;
609,BOOK I.,"By such examples taught, I paint the Cot,"
610,BOOK I.,As Truth will paint it and as Bards will not:
611,BOOK I.,"For you, ye Poor, of letter’d scorn complain,"
612,BOOK I.,To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain;
613,BOOK I.,"O’ercome by labour and bow’d down by time,"
614,BOOK I.,Feel you the barren flattery of a Rhyme?
615,BOOK I.,"Can Poets sooth you, when you pine for bread,"
616,BOOK I.,By winding myrtles round your ruin’d shed?
617,BOOK I.,"Can their light tales your weighty griefs o’erpower,"
618,BOOK I.,Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour?
619,BOOK I.,"Lo! where the heath, with withering brake grown o’er,"
620,BOOK I.,Lends the light turf that warms the neighbouring poor;
621,BOOK I.,"From thence a length of burning sand appears,"
622,BOOK I.,Where the thin harvest waves its wither’d ears;
623,BOOK I.,"Rank weeds, that every art and care defy,"
624,BOOK I.,Reign o’er the land and rob the blighted rye:
625,BOOK I.,"There Thistles stretch their prickly arms afar,"
626,BOOK I.,And to the ragged infant threaten war;
627,BOOK I.,"There Poppies nodding, mock the hope of toil;"
628,BOOK I.,There the blue Bugloss paints the sterile soil;
629,BOOK I.,"Hardy and high, above the slender sheaf,"
630,BOOK I.,The slimy Mallow waves her silky leaf;
631,BOOK I.,"O’er the young shoot the Charlock throws a shade,"
632,BOOK I.,And clasping Tares cling round the sickly blade;
633,BOOK I.,"With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound,"
634,BOOK I.,And a sad splendour vainly shines around.
635,BOOK I.,"So looks the Nymph whom wretched arts adorn,"
636,BOOK I.,"Betray’d by Man, then left for Man to scorn;"
637,BOOK I.,"Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose,"
638,BOOK I.,While her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose;
639,BOOK I.,"Whose outward splendour is but folly’s dress,"
640,BOOK I.,"Exposing most, when most it gilds distress."
641,BOOK I.,"Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race,"
642,BOOK I.,With sullen woe display’d in every face;
643,BOOK I.,"Who, far from civil arts and social fly,"
644,BOOK I.,And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye.
645,BOOK I.,Here too the lawless Merchant of the main
646,BOOK I.,Draws from his plough th’ intoxicated Swain;
647,BOOK I.,"Want only claim’d the labour of the day,"
648,BOOK I.,But vice now steals his nightly rest away.
649,BOOK I.,"Where are the Swains, who, daily labour done,"
650,BOOK I.,With rural games play’d down the setting sun;
651,BOOK I.,"Who struck with matchless force the bounding ball,"
652,BOOK I.,Or made the pond’rous quoit obliquely fall;
653,BOOK I.,"While some huge Ajax, terrible and strong,"
654,BOOK I.,"Engag’d some artful stripling of the throng,"
655,BOOK I.,"And fell beneath him, foil’d, while far around,"
656,BOOK I.,Hoarse triumph rose and rocks return’d the sound?
657,BOOK I.,"Where now are these?--Beneath yon cliff they stand,"
658,BOOK I.,To show the freighted pinnace where to land;
659,BOOK I.,"To load the ready steed with guilty haste,"
660,BOOK I.,"To fly in terror o’er the pathless waste,"
661,BOOK I.,"Or when detected, in their straggling course,"
662,BOOK I.,To foil their foes by cunning or by force;
663,BOOK I.,Or yielding part (which equal knaves demand)
664,BOOK I.,To gain a lawless passport through the land.
665,BOOK I.,"Here wand’ring long, amid these frowning fields,"
666,BOOK I.,I sought the simple life that Nature yields;
667,BOOK I.,"Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurp’d her place,"
668,BOOK I.,"And a bold, artful, surly, savage race;"
669,BOOK I.,"Who, only skill’d to take the finny tribe,"
670,BOOK I.,"The yearly dinner, or septennial bribe,"
671,BOOK I.,"Wait on the shore, and as the waves run high,"
672,BOOK I.,On the tost vessel bend their eager eye;
673,BOOK I.,"Which to their coast directs its vent’rous way,"
674,BOOK I.,"Their’s, or the ocean’s miserable prey."
675,BOOK I.,"As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand,"
676,BOOK I.,And wait for favouring winds to leave the land;
677,BOOK I.,While still for flight the ready wing is spread:
678,BOOK I.,"So waited I the favouring hour, and fled;"
679,BOOK I.,"Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign,"
680,BOOK I.,"And cry’d, Ah! hapless they who still remain;"
681,BOOK I.,"Who still remain to hear the ocean roar,"
682,BOOK I.,Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore;
683,BOOK I.,"Till some fierce tide, with more imperious sway,"
684,BOOK I.,Sweeps the low hut and all it holds away;
685,BOOK I.,"When the sad tenant weeps from door to door,"
686,BOOK I.,And begs a poor protection from the poor!
687,BOOK I.,But these are scenes where Nature’s niggard hand
688,BOOK I.,Gave a spare portion to the famish’d land;
689,BOOK I.,"Her’s is the fault, if here mankind complain"
690,BOOK I.,Of fruitless toil and labour spent in vain;
691,BOOK I.,"But yet in other scenes more fair in view,"
692,BOOK I.,"Where Plenty smiles--alas! she smiles for few,"
693,BOOK I.,"And those who taste not, yet behold her store,}"
694,BOOK I.,"Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore,    }"
695,BOOK I.,The wealth around them makes them doubly poor.}
696,BOOK I.,"Or will you deem them amply paid in health,"
697,BOOK I.,"Labour’s fair child, that languishes with Wealth?"
698,BOOK I.,"Go then! and see them rising with the sun,"
699,BOOK I.,Through a long course of daily toil to run;
700,BOOK I.,"See them beneath the Dog-star’s raging heat,"
701,BOOK I.,When the knees tremble and the temples beat;
702,BOOK I.,"Behold them, leaning on their scythes, look o’er"
703,BOOK I.,"The labour past, and toils to come explore;"
704,BOOK I.,"See them alternate suns and showers engage,"
705,BOOK I.,And hoard up aches and anguish for their age;
706,BOOK I.,"Thro’ fens and marshy moors their steps pursue,"
707,BOOK I.,When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew;
708,BOOK I.,Then own that labour may as fatal be
709,BOOK I.,"To these thy slaves, as thine excess to thee."
710,BOOK I.,Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride
711,BOOK I.,Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide;
712,BOOK I.,There may you see the youth of slender frame
713,BOOK I.,"Contend with weakness, weariness, and shame;"
714,BOOK I.,"Yet urg’d along, and proudly loth to yield,"
715,BOOK I.,He strives to join his fellows of the field;
716,BOOK I.,"Till long-contending nature droops at last,"
717,BOOK I.,"Declining health rejects his poor repast,"
718,BOOK I.,"His cheerless Spouse the coming danger sees,"
719,BOOK I.,And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease.
720,BOOK I.,"Yet grant them health, ’tis not for us to tell,"
721,BOOK I.,"Though the head droops not, that the heart is well;"
722,BOOK I.,"Or will you praise that, homely, healthy fare,"
723,BOOK I.,"Plenteous and plain, that happy Peasants share?"
724,BOOK I.,"Oh! trifle not with wants you cannot feel,"
725,BOOK I.,Nor mock the misery of a stinted meal;
726,BOOK I.,"Homely not wholesome, plain not plenteous, such"
727,BOOK I.,As you who praise would never deign to touch.
728,BOOK I.,"Ye gentle souls, who dream of Rural ease,"
729,BOOK I.,Whom the smooth Stream and smoother Sonnet please;
730,BOOK I.,"Go! if the peaceful Cot your praises share,"
731,BOOK I.,"Go look within, and ask if Peace be there;"
732,BOOK I.,"If Peace be his--that drooping weary Sire,"
733,BOOK I.,"Or their’s, that Offspring round their feeble fire;"
734,BOOK I.,"Or her’s, that Matron pale, whose trembling hand"
735,BOOK I.,Turns on the wretched hearth th’ expiring brand!
736,BOOK I.,Nor yet can Time itself obtain for these
737,BOOK I.,"Life’s latest comforts, due respect and ease;"
738,BOOK I.,"For yonder see that hoary Swain, whose age,"
739,BOOK I.,Can with no cares except its own engage;
740,BOOK I.,"Who, propt on that rude staff, looks up to see"
741,BOOK I.,The bare arms broken from the withering tree;
742,BOOK I.,"On which, a boy, he climb’d the loftiest bough,"
743,BOOK I.,"Then his first joy, but his sad emblem now."
744,BOOK I.,"He once was chief in all the Rustic-trade,"
745,BOOK I.,His steady hand the straightest furrow made;
746,BOOK I.,"Full many a prize he won, and still is proud"
747,BOOK I.,To find the triumphs of his youth allow’d;
748,BOOK I.,"A transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes,"
749,BOOK I.,"He hears and smiles, then thinks again and sighs:"
750,BOOK I.,For now he journeys to his grave in pain;
751,BOOK I.,"The rich disdain him; nay, the poor disdain;"
752,BOOK I.,"Alternate masters now their slave command,"
753,BOOK I.,"Urge the weak efforts of his feeble hand,"
754,BOOK I.,"And, when his age attempts its task in vain,"
755,BOOK I.,"With ruthless taunts, of lazy poor complain[4]."
756,BOOK I.,"Oft may you see him when he tends the sheep,"
757,BOOK I.,"His winter-charge, beneath the hillock weep;"
758,BOOK I.,Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow
759,BOOK I.,O’er his white locks and bury them in snow;
760,BOOK I.,"When rous’d by rage and muttering in the morn,"
761,BOOK I.,He mends the broken hedge with icy thorn.
762,BOOK I.,"“Why do I live, when I desire to be"
763,BOOK I.,“At once from life and life’s long labour free?
764,BOOK I.,"“Like leaves in spring, the young are blown away,"
765,BOOK I.,“Without the sorrows of a slow decay;
766,BOOK I.,"“I, like yon wither’d leaf, remain behind,"
767,BOOK I.,“Nipt by the frost and shivering in the wind;
768,BOOK I.,"“There it abides till younger buds come on,"
769,BOOK I.,"“As I, now all my fellow swains are gone;"
770,BOOK I.,"“Then, from the rising generation thrust,"
771,BOOK I.,"“It falls, like me, unnotic’d to the dust."
772,BOOK I.,"“These fruitful Fields, these numerous Flocks I see,"

782,BOOK I.,"Thus groan the Old, till, by disease opprest,"
783,BOOK I.,"They taste a final woe, and then they rest."
784,BOOK I.,"Their’s is yon House that holds the Parish Poor,"
785,BOOK I.,Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door;
786,BOOK I.,"There, where the putrid vapours flagging, play,"
787,BOOK I.,And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day;--
788,BOOK I.,There Children dwell who know no Parents’ care;
789,BOOK I.,"Parents, who know no Children’s love, dwell there;"
790,BOOK I.,"Heart-broken Matrons on their joyless bed,"
791,BOOK I.,Forsaken Wives and Mothers never wed;
792,BOOK I.,"Dejected Widows with unheeded tears,"
793,BOOK I.,And crippled Age with more than childhood-fears;
794,BOOK I.,"The Lame, the Blind, and, far the happiest they!"
795,BOOK I.,The moping Idiot and the Madman gay.
796,BOOK I.,"Here too the Sick their final doom receive,"
797,BOOK I.,"Here brought amid the scenes of grief, to grieve,"
798,BOOK I.,"Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow,"
799,BOOK I.,Mixt with the clamours of the crowd below;
800,BOOK I.,"Here sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan,"
801,BOOK I.,And the cold charities of man to man:
802,BOOK I.,"Whose laws indeed for ruin’d Age provide,"
803,BOOK I.,And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride;
804,BOOK I.,"But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh,"
805,BOOK I.,And pride imbitters what it can’t deny.
806,BOOK I.,"Say ye, opprest by some fantastic woes,"
807,BOOK I.,Some jarring nerve that baffles your repose;
808,BOOK I.,"Who press the downy couch, while slaves advance"
809,BOOK I.,"With timid eye, to read the distant glance;"
810,BOOK I.,"Who with sad prayers the weary Doctor tease,"
811,BOOK I.,To name the nameless ever-new disease;
812,BOOK I.,"Who with mock patience dire complaints endure,"
813,BOOK I.,Which real pain and that alone can cure;
814,BOOK I.,"How would ye bear in real pain to lie,"
815,BOOK I.,"Despis’d, neglected, left alone to die?"
816,BOOK I.,"How would ye bear to draw your latest breath,"
817,BOOK I.,Where all that’s wretched pave the way for death?
818,BOOK I.,"Such is that room which one rude beam divides,"
819,BOOK I.,And naked rafters from the sloping sides;
820,BOOK I.,"Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen,"
821,BOOK I.,And lath and mud are all that lie between;
822,BOOK I.,"Save one dull pane, that, coarsely patch’d, gives way"
823,BOOK I.,"To the rude tempest, yet excludes the day:"
824,BOOK I.,"Here, on a matted flock, with dust o’erspread,"
825,BOOK I.,The drooping wretch reclines his languid head;
826,BOOK I.,"For him no hand the cordial cup applies,"
827,BOOK I.,Or wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes;
828,BOOK I.,"No friends with soft discourse his pain beguile,"
829,BOOK I.,Or promise hope till sickness wears a smile.
830,BOOK I.,"But soon a loud and hasty summons calls,"
831,BOOK I.,"Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls;"
832,BOOK I.,"Anon, a Figure enters, quaintly neat,"
833,BOOK I.,"All pride and business, bustle and conceit;"
834,BOOK I.,"With looks unalter’d by these scenes of woe,"
835,BOOK I.,"With speed that, entering, speaks his haste to go;"
836,BOOK I.,"He bids the gazing throng around him fly,"
837,BOOK I.,And carries Fate and Physic in his eye;
838,BOOK I.,"A potent Quack, long vers’d in human ills,"
839,BOOK I.,Who first insults the victim whom he kills;
840,BOOK I.,"Whose murd’rous hand a drowsy Bench protect,"
841,BOOK I.,And whose most tender mercy is neglect.
842,BOOK I.,"Paid by the Parish for attendance here,"
843,BOOK I.,He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer;
844,BOOK I.,"In haste he seeks the bed where Misery lies,"
845,BOOK I.,Impatience mark’d in his averted eyes;
846,BOOK I.,"And, some habitual queries hurried o’er,"
847,BOOK I.,"Without reply, he rushes on the door;"
848,BOOK I.,"His drooping Patient, long inur’d to pain,"
849,BOOK I.,"And long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;"
850,BOOK I.,He ceases now the feeble help to crave
851,BOOK I.,Of Man; and silent sinks into the grave.
852,BOOK I.,"But ere his death some pious doubts arise,"
853,BOOK I.,Some simple fears which “bold bad” men despise:
854,BOOK I.,Fain would he ask the Parish Priest to prove
855,BOOK I.,His title certain to the Joys above;
856,BOOK I.,"For this he sends the murmuring Nurse, who calls"
857,BOOK I.,The holy Stranger to these dismal walls;
858,BOOK I.,"And doth not he, the pious man, appear,"
859,BOOK I.,"He, “passing rich with forty pounds a year?”"
860,BOOK I.,"Ah! no, a Shepherd of a different stock,"
861,BOOK I.,"And far unlike him, feeds this little Flock;"
862,BOOK I.,"A jovial youth, who thinks his Sunday’s task,"
863,BOOK I.,As much as God or Man can fairly ask;
864,BOOK I.,"The rest he gives to Loves and Labours light,"
865,BOOK I.,To Fields the morning and to Feasts the night;
866,BOOK I.,"None better skill’d the noisy Pack to guide,"
867,BOOK I.,"To urge their chace, to cheer them or to chide;"
868,BOOK I.,"A Sportsman keen, he shoots through half the day,"
869,BOOK I.,"And skill’d at Whist, devotes the night to play;"
870,BOOK I.,"Then, while such honours bloom around his head,"
871,BOOK I.,"Shall he sit sadly by the Sick Man’s bed,"
872,BOOK I.,"To raise the hope he feels not, or with zeal"
873,BOOK I.,To combat fears that ev’n the pious feel?
874,BOOK I.,"Now once again the gloomy scene explore,}"
875,BOOK I.,"Less gloomy now; the bitter hour is o’er, }"
876,BOOK I.,The Man of many Sorrows sighs no more.--  }
877,BOOK I.,"Up yonder hill, behold how sadly slow"
878,BOOK I.,The Bier moves winding from the vale below;
879,BOOK I.,"There lie the happy Dead from trouble free,"
880,BOOK I.,And the glad Parish pays the frugal fee:
881,BOOK I.,"No more, O Death! thy victim starts to hear"
882,BOOK I.,"Churchwarden stern, or kingly Overseer;"
883,BOOK I.,"No more the Farmer claims his humble bow,"
884,BOOK I.,"Thou art his lord, the best of tyrants thou!"
885,BOOK I.,"Now to the Church behold the Mourners come,"
886,BOOK I.,Sedately torpid and devoutly dumb;
887,BOOK I.,"The Village Children now their games suspend,"
888,BOOK I.,To see the Bier that bears their ancient Friend;
889,BOOK I.,"For he was one in all their idle sport,"
890,BOOK I.,And like a Monarch rul’d their little Court;
891,BOOK I.,"The pliant Bow he form’d, the flying Ball,"
892,BOOK I.,"The Bat, the Wicket, were his labours all;"
893,BOOK I.,"Him now they follow to his grave, and stand"
894,BOOK I.,"Silent and sad, and gazing, hand in hand;"
895,BOOK I.,"While bending low, their eager eyes explore"
896,BOOK I.,The mingled relicks of the Parish Poor:
897,BOOK I.,"The bell tolls late, the moping owl flies round,"
898,BOOK I.,Fear marks the flight and magnifies the sound;
899,BOOK I.,"The busy Priest, detain’d by weightier care,"
900,BOOK I.,Defers his duty till the day of prayer;
901,BOOK I.,"And waiting long, the crowd retire distrest,"
902,BOOK I.,To think a Poor Man’s bones should lie unblest[5].

939,BOOK II.,"I too must yield, that oft amid these woes"
940,BOOK II.,"Are gleams of transient Mirth and hours of sweet Repose,"
941,BOOK II.,"Such as you find on yonder sportive Green,"
942,BOOK II.,The ‘Squire’s tall gate and Churchway-walk between;
943,BOOK II.,"Where loitering stray a little tribe of friends,"
944,BOOK II.,On a fair Sunday when the Sermon ends:
945,BOOK II.,"Then Rural Beaux their best attire put on,"
946,BOOK II.,"To win their Nymphs, as other Nymphs are won;"
947,BOOK II.,"While those long wed go plain, and by degrees,"
948,BOOK II.,Like other Husbands quit their care to please.
949,BOOK II.,"Some of the Sermon talk, a sober crowd,"
950,BOOK II.,"And loudly praise, if it were preach’d aloud;"
951,BOOK II.,"Some on the Labours of the Week look round,"
952,BOOK II.,"Feel their own worth, and think their toil renown’d;"
953,BOOK II.,"While some, whose hopes to no renown extend,"
954,BOOK II.,Are only pleas’d to find their Labours end.
955,BOOK II.,"Thus, as their hours glide on with pleasure fraught,"
956,BOOK II.,Their careful Masters brood the painful thought;
957,BOOK II.,"Much in their mind they murmur and lament,"
958,BOOK II.,That one fair day should be so idly spent;
959,BOOK II.,"And think that Heaven deals hard, to tithe their store"
960,BOOK II.,And tax their Time for Preachers and the Poor.
961,BOOK II.,"Yet still, ye humbler friends, enjoy your Hour,"
962,BOOK II.,"This is your Portion, yet unclaim’d of Power;"
963,BOOK II.,"This is Heaven’s gift to weary men opprest,"

965,BOOK II.,"But yours, alas! are joys that soon decay;"
966,BOOK II.,"Frail joys, begun and ended with the Day;"
967,BOOK II.,"Or yet, while day permits those joys to reign,"
968,BOOK II.,The Village vices drive them from the plain.
969,BOOK II.,"See the stout Churl, in drunken fury great,"
970,BOOK II.,Strike the bare bosom of his teeming mate!
971,BOOK II.,"His naked vices, rude and unrefin’d,"
972,BOOK II.,Exert their open empire o’er the mind;
973,BOOK II.,"But can we less the senseless rage despise,"
974,BOOK II.,Because the savage acts without disguise?
975,BOOK II.,"Yet here Disguise, the City’s vice, is seen,"
976,BOOK II.,And Slander steals along and taints the Green.
977,BOOK II.,"At her approach domestic Peace is gone,"
978,BOOK II.,Domestic Broils at her approach come on;
979,BOOK II.,"She to the Wife the Husband’s crime conveys,"
980,BOOK II.,She tells the Husband when his Consort strays;
981,BOOK II.,"Her busy tongue, through all the little state,"
982,BOOK II.,"Diffuses doubt, suspicion, and debate;"
983,BOOK II.,"Peace, tim’rous Goddess! quits her old domain,"
984,BOOK II.,In Sentiment and Song content to reign.

986,BOOK II.,"So fair as Cynthia’s, nor so chaste as fair;"

990,BOOK II.,The Peer’s disease in turn attacks the Clown.
991,BOOK II.,"Here too the ’Squire, or ’squire-like Farmer, talk,"

994,BOOK II.,The rip’ning treasures from their lofty wall;
995,BOOK II.,"How meaner rivals in their sports delight,"
996,BOOK II.,Just rich enough to claim a doubtful right;
997,BOOK II.,"Who take a licence round their fields to stray,"
998,BOOK II.,A mongrel race! the Poachers of the day.
999,BOOK II.,"And hark! the riots of the Green begin,"
1000,BOOK II.,That sprang at first from yonder noisy Inn;
1001,BOOK II.,"What time the weekly pay was vanish’d all,"
1002,BOOK II.,And the slow Hostess scor’d the threat’ning wall;
1003,BOOK II.,"What time they ask’d, their friendly feast to close,"
1004,BOOK II.,"A final cup, and that will make them foes;"
1005,BOOK II.,"When blows ensue that break the arm of Toil,"
1006,BOOK II.,And rustic battle ends the boobies’ broil.
1007,BOOK II.,Save when to yonder Hall they bend their way;
1008,BOOK II.,Where the grave Justice ends the grievous fray;
1009,BOOK II.,"He who recites, to keep the Poor in awe,"
1010,BOOK II.,The Law’s vast volume--for he knows the Law.--
1011,BOOK II.,To him with anger or with shame repair
1012,BOOK II.,The injur’d Peasant and deluded Fair.
1013,BOOK II.,"Lo! at his throne the silent Nymph appears,"
1014,BOOK II.,"Frail by her shape, but modest in her tears;"
1015,BOOK II.,"And while she stands abash’d, with conscious eye,"
1016,BOOK II.,Some favourite Female of her Judge glides by:
1017,BOOK II.,"Who views with scornful glance the strumpet’s fate,"
1018,BOOK II.,And thanks the stars that made her Keeper great:
1019,BOOK II.,"Near her the Swain, about to bear for life"
1020,BOOK II.,"One certain evil, doubts ’twixt War and Wife;"
1021,BOOK II.,"But, while the faultering Damsel takes her oath,"
1022,BOOK II.,"Consents to wed, and so secures them both."

1024,BOOK II.,Why make the Poor as guilty as the Great?
1025,BOOK II.,"To shew the Great, those mightier sons of Pride,"
1026,BOOK II.,How near in vice the lowest are allied;
1027,BOOK II.,"Such are their natures and their passions such,"
1028,BOOK II.,"But these disguise too little, those too much:"
1029,BOOK II.,So shall the man of Power and Pleasure see
1030,BOOK II.,In his own Slave as vile a wretch as he;
1031,BOOK II.,In his luxurious Lord the Servant find
1032,BOOK II.,His own low pleasures and degenerate mind:
1033,BOOK II.,"And each in all the kindred vices trace,"
1034,BOOK II.,"Of a poor, blind, bewilder’d, erring Race;"
1035,BOOK II.,"Who, a short time in varied fortune past,"
1036,BOOK II.,"Die, and are equal in the dust at last."
1037,BOOK II.,"And you, ye Poor, who still lament your fate,"

1040,BOOK II.,"They are, like you, the victims of distress;"
1041,BOOK II.,"While Sloth with many a pang torments her slave,"
1042,BOOK II.,"Fear waits on Guilt, and Danger shakes the brave."
1043,BOOK II.,"Oh! if in life one noble Chief appears,"
1044,BOOK II.,"Great in his name, while blooming in his years;"
1045,BOOK II.,"Born to enjoy whate’er delights Mankind,"
1046,BOOK II.,And yet to all you feel or fear resign’d;
1047,BOOK II.,"Who gave up joys and hopes to you unknown,"
1048,BOOK II.,For pains and dangers greater than your own;
1049,BOOK II.,"If such there be, then let your murmurs cease,"
1050,BOOK II.,"Think, think of him, and take your lot in peace."
1051,BOOK II.,"And such there was:--Oh! grief, that checks our pride,"
1052,BOOK II.,"Weeping we say there was,--for MANNERS died;"
1053,BOOK II.,"Beloved of Heav’n, these humble lines forgive,"
1054,BOOK II.,"That sing of Thee[6], and thus aspire to live."
1055,BOOK II.,"As the tall Oak, whose vigorous branches form"
1056,BOOK II.,"An ample shade and brave the wildest storm,"
1057,BOOK II.,"High o’er the subject Wood is seen to grow,"
1058,BOOK II.,The guard and glory of the Trees below;
1059,BOOK II.,"Till on its head the fiery bolt descends,"
1060,BOOK II.,And o’er the plain the shatter’d trunk extends;
1061,BOOK II.,"Yet then it lies, all wond’rous as before,"
1062,BOOK II.,"And still the Glory, though the Guard no more."
1063,BOOK II.,"So THOU, when every virtue, every grace,"
1064,BOOK II.,"Rose in thy soul, or shone within thy face;"
1065,BOOK II.,"When, though the Son of GRANBY, Thou wert known"
1066,BOOK II.,Less by thy Father’s glory than thy own;
1067,BOOK II.,"When Honour lov’d and gave Thee every charm,"
1068,BOOK II.,Fire to thy eye and vigour to thy arm;
1069,BOOK II.,"Then from our lofty hopes and longing eyes,"
1070,BOOK II.,Fate and thy Virtues call’d Thee to the Skies;
1071,BOOK II.,"Yet still we wonder at thy tow’ring fame,"
1072,BOOK II.,"And losing Thee, still dwell upon thy Name."
1073,BOOK II.,"Oh! ever honour’d, ever valued! say,"
1074,BOOK II.,"What Verse can praise Thee, or what Work repay?"
1075,BOOK II.,"Yet Verse (in all we can) thy worth repays,"
1076,BOOK II.,Nor trusts the tardy zeal of future days;--

1078,BOOK II.,"Thee in their hearts, the Good, the Brave shall bear;"
1079,BOOK II.,"To deeds like thine shall noblest Chiefs aspire,"

1081,BOOK II.,"In future times, when smit with Glory’s charms,"
1082,BOOK II.,The untry’d youth first quits a Father’s arms;--
1083,BOOK II.,"“Oh! be like him,” the weeping Sire shall say;"
1084,BOOK II.,"“Like MANNERS walk, who walk’d in Honour’s way;"
1085,BOOK II.,"“In Danger foremost, yet in Death sedate,"
1086,BOOK II.,"“Oh! be like Him in all things, but his fate!”"
1087,BOOK II.,"If for that Fate such public Tears be shed,"
1088,BOOK II.,That Victory seems to die now THOU art dead;
1089,BOOK II.,"How shall a Friend his nearer hope resign,"
1090,BOOK II.,"That Friend a Brother, and whose soul was thine;"
1091,BOOK II.,"By what bold lines shall we his grief express,"
1092,BOOK II.,Or by what soothing numbers make it less?
1093,BOOK II.,"’Tis not, I know, the chiming of a song,"
1094,BOOK II.,"Nor all the powers that to the Muse belong,"
1095,BOOK II.,"Words aptly cull’d and Meanings well exprest,"
1096,BOOK II.,Can calm the sorrows of a wounded breast;
1097,BOOK II.,"But Virtue, soother of the fiercest pains,"
1098,BOOK II.,"Shall heal that bosom, RUTLAND, where she reigns."
1099,BOOK II.,"Yet hard the task to heal the bleeding heart,"
1100,BOOK II.,To bid the still-recurring thoughts depart;
1101,BOOK II.,"Tame the fierce grief and stem the rising sigh,"
1102,BOOK II.,"And curb rebellious passion, with reply;--"
1103,BOOK II.,"Calmly to dwell on all that pleas’d before,"
1104,BOOK II.,And yet to know that all shall please no more;--
1105,BOOK II.,Oh! glorious labour of the soul to save
1106,BOOK II.,"Her captive powers, and bravely mourn the Brave."
1107,BOOK II.,"To such, these thoughts will lasting comfort give--"
1108,BOOK II.,Life is not measur’d by the time we live;
1109,BOOK II.,"’Tis not an even course of threescore years,"
1110,BOOK II.,"A life of narrow views and paltry fears,"
1111,BOOK II.,"Grey-hairs and wrinkles and the cares they bring,"
1112,BOOK II.,"That take from Death, the terrors or the sting;"
1113,BOOK II.,"But ’tis the gen’rous Spirit, mounting high"
1114,BOOK II.,"Above the world, that native of the Sky;"
1115,BOOK II.,"The noble Spirit, that, in dangers brave,"
1116,BOOK II.,"Calmly looks on, or looks beyond the grave:--"
1117,BOOK II.,"Such MANNERS was, so he resign’d his breath,"
1118,BOOK II.,"If in a glorious, then a timely death."
1119,BOOK II.,Cease then that grief and let those tears subside;
1120,BOOK II.,"If Passion rule us, be that passion Pride;"
1121,BOOK II.,"If Reason, Reason bids us strive to raise"
1122,BOOK II.,Our fallen hearts and be like Him we praise!

1124,BOOK II.,"Bring all his virtues, all his worth in view,}"
1125,BOOK II.,And let Affection find its comfort too:      }
1126,BOOK II.,"For how can Grief so deeply wound the heart,"
1127,BOOK II.,When Admiration claims so large a part?
1128,BOOK II.,"Grief is a foe, expel him then thy soul,"
1129,BOOK II.,Let nobler thoughts the nearer views controul!
1130,BOOK II.,"Oh! make the Age to come thy better care,"

1134,BOOK II.,"And from their fate, thy Race shall nobler grow,"
1135,BOOK II.,As trees shoot upwards that are prun’d below;

1137,BOOK II.,Sees his young Streams run warbling at his side;
1138,BOOK II.,"Though some, by art cut off, no longer run,"
1139,BOOK II.,And some are lost beneath the Summer’s Sun--

1439,PART I.,(With strong resentment) of the want she makes.
1440,PART I.,"Whence all these woes?--From want of virtuous will,"
1441,PART I.,"Of honest shame, of time-improving skill;"

2273,PART II.,"By trade a Tailor, though, in scorn of trade,"
2274,PART II.,"He serv’d the Squire, and brush’d the Coat he made;"
2275,PART II.,"Yet now, would _Phœbe_ her Consent afford,"
2276,PART II.,"Her slave alone, again he’d mount the Board;"
2277,PART II.,"With her should years of growing Love be spent,"
2278,PART II.,And growing Wealth:--She sigh’d and look’d consent.
2279,PART II.,"Now, through the lane, up hill, and cross the Green,"
2280,PART II.,(Seen by but few and blushing to be seen--
2281,PART II.,"Dejected, thoughtful, anxious, and afraid,)"
2282,PART II.,"Led by the Lover, walk’d the silent Maid:"
2283,PART II.,"Slow through the meadows rov’d they, many a mile,"
2284,PART II.,Toy’d by each bank and trifled at each stile;
2285,PART II.,"Where, as he painted every blissful view,"
2286,PART II.,"And highly colour’d what he strongly drew,"
2287,PART II.,"The pensive Damsel, prone to tender fears,"
2288,PART II.,Dimm’d the false prospect with prophetic tears:
2289,PART II.,"Thus pass’d th’ allotted Hours, till lingering late,"
2290,PART II.,The Lover loiter’d at the Master’s gate;
2291,PART II.,"There he pronounc’d adieu! and yet would stay,"
2292,PART II.,Till chidden--sooth’d--intreated--forc’d away;
2293,PART II.,"He would of coldness, though indulg’d, complain,"
2294,PART II.,And oft retire and oft return again;
2295,PART II.,"When, if his teasing vex’d her gentle mind,"
2296,PART II.,"The Grief assum’d, compell’d her to be kind!"
2297,PART II.,"For he would proof of plighted Kindness crave,"
2298,PART II.,"That she resented first and then forgave,"
2299,PART II.,"And to his Grief and Penance yielded more,"
2300,PART II.,Than his Presumption had requir’d before:--
2301,PART II.,"Ah! fly temptation, Youth, refrain! refrain,"
2302,PART II.,Each yielding Maid and each presuming Swain!
2303,PART II.,
2304,PART II.,"Lo! now with red rent Cloak and Bonnet black,"
2305,PART II.,"And torn green Gown loose hanging at her back,"
2306,PART II.,"One who an Infant in her arm sustains,"
2307,PART II.,"And seems in patience, striving with her pains;"
2308,PART II.,"Pinch’d are her Looks, as one who pines for Bread,"
2309,PART II.,Whose Cares are growing and whose Hopes are fled;
2310,PART II.,"Pale her parch’d Lips, her heavy Eyes sunk low,"
2311,PART II.,And Tears unnotic’d from their Channels flow;
2312,PART II.,"Serene her manner, till some sudden Pain,"
2313,PART II.,Frets the meek soul and then she’s calm again--
2314,PART II.,"Her broken Pitcher to the Pool she takes,"
2315,PART II.,And every step with cautious terror makes;
2316,PART II.,"For not alone that Infant in her arms,"
2317,PART II.,"But nearer Cause, her anxious Soul alarms;"
2318,PART II.,"With Water burthen’d, then she picks her way,"
2319,PART II.,"Slowly and cautious, in the clinging clay;"
2320,PART II.,"Till, in Mid-Green, she trusts a place unsound,"
2321,PART II.,And deeply plunges in th’ adhesive ground;
2322,PART II.,"Thence, but with pain, her slender foot she takes,"
2323,PART II.,While Hope the Mind as Strength the Frame forsakes:
2324,PART II.,"For when so full the Cup of Sorrow grows,"
2325,PART II.,"Add but a drop, it instantly o’erflows.--"
2326,PART II.,"And now her Path but not her Peace she gains,"
2327,PART II.,"Safe from her Task, but shivering with her pains;"
2328,PART II.,"Her Home she reaches, open leaves the door,"
2329,PART II.,"And placing first her Infant on the floor,"
2330,PART II.,"She bares her Bosom to the Wind and sits,"
2331,PART II.,And sobbing struggles with the rising Fits;
2332,PART II.,"In vain, they come, she feels th’ inflating grief,"
2333,PART II.,That shuts the swelling Bosom from relief;
2334,PART II.,"That speaks in feeble cries a Soul distrest,"
2335,PART II.,Or the sad laugh that cannot be represt;
2336,PART II.,The Neighbour-Matron leaves her Wheel and flies
2337,PART II.,With all the aid her Poverty supplies;
2338,PART II.,"Unfee’d, the Calls of Nature she obeys,"
2339,PART II.,"Not led by profit, not allur’d by praise;"
2340,PART II.,"And waiting long, till these Contentions cease,"
2341,PART II.,She speaks of Comfort and departs in peace.
2342,PART II.,"Friend of Distress! the Mourner feels thy Aid,"
2343,PART II.,"She cannot pay thee, but thou wilt be paid."
2344,PART II.,
2345,PART II.,"But who this Child of Weakness, Want, and Care?"
2346,PART II.,"’Tis _Phœbe Dawson_, Pride of _Lammas-Fair_;"
2347,PART II.,"Who took her Lover for his sparkling Eyes,"
2348,PART II.,"Expressions warm, and love-inspiring Lies:"
2349,PART II.,"Compassion first assail’d her gentle Heart,"
2350,PART II.,"For all his suffering, all his bosom’s smart:"
2351,PART II.,"“And then his Prayers! they would a Savage move,"
2352,PART II.,“And win the coldest of the Sex to Love:”--
2353,PART II.,"But ah! too soon his Looks Success declar’d,"
2354,PART II.,Too late her Loss the Marriage-rite repair’d;
2355,PART II.,"The faithless Flatterer then his Vows forgot,"
2356,PART II.,A captious Tyrant or a noisy Sot:
2357,PART II.,"If present, railing, till he saw her pain’d;"
2358,PART II.,"If absent, spending what their Labours gain’d;"
2359,PART II.,"Till that fair Form in want and sickness pin’d,"
2360,PART II.,And Hope and Comfort fled that gentle Mind.
2361,PART II.,"Then fly temptation, Youth; resist, refrain!"
2362,PART II.,Nor let me preach for ever and in vain!
2363,PART II.,
2364,PART II.,"Next came a well-drest Pair, who left their Coach,"
2365,PART II.,"And made, in long procession, slow approach:"
2366,PART II.,"For, this gay Bride had many a Female Friend,"
2367,PART II.,"And Youths were there, this favour’d Youth t’ attend:"
2368,PART II.,"Silent, nor wanting due respect, the Crowd"
2369,PART II.,Stood humbly round and Gratulation bow’d;
2370,PART II.,"But not that silent Crowd, in wonder fixt,"
2371,PART II.,"Not numerous Friends, who praise and envy mix’d,"
2372,PART II.,Nor Nymphs attending near to swell the pride
2373,PART II.,"Of one more fair, the ever-smiling Bride;"
2374,PART II.,"Nor that gay Bride adorn’d with every Grace,      }"
2375,PART II.,"Nor Love nor Joy triumphant in her Face,          }"
2376,PART II.,"Could from the Youth’s, sad signs of Sorrow chase:}"
2377,PART II.,"Why didst thou grieve? Wealth, Pleasure, Freedom thine;"
2378,PART II.,"Vex’d it thy soul, that Freedom to resign?"
2379,PART II.,"Spake Scandle truth? “Thou didst not then intend,"
2380,PART II.,So soon to bring thy wooing to an end?”
2381,PART II.,"Or was it, as our prating Rustics say,"
2382,PART II.,"To end as soon, but in a different way?"
2383,PART II.,"’Tis told thy _Phyllis_ is a skilful Dame,"
2384,PART II.,Who play’d uninjur’d with the dangerous Flame:
2385,PART II.,That while like _Lovelace_ thou thy Coat display’d
2386,PART II.,"And hid the Snare, prepar’d to catch the Maid,"
2387,PART II.,"Thee with her Net, she found the means to catch,"
2388,PART II.,"And at the amorous See-saw, won the Match[8];"
2389,PART II.,"Yet others tell, the Captain fix’d thy doubt,"
2390,PART II.,"He’d call thee Brother, or he’d call thee out:--"
2391,PART II.,"But rest the Motive--all Retreat too late,"
2392,PART II.,Joy like thy Bride’s should on thy brow have sate;
2393,PART II.,"The deed had then appear’d thine own intent,  }"
2394,PART II.,"A glorious day, by gracious fortune sent,     }"
2395,PART II.,In each revolving Year to be in triumph spent.}
2396,PART II.,"Then in few weeks that cloudy Brow had been,"
2397,PART II.,Without a wonder or a whisper seen;
2398,PART II.,"And none had been so weak as to enquire,"
2399,PART II.,“Why pouts my Lady?” or “why frowns the Squire?”
2400,PART II.,
2401,PART II.,"How fair these Names, how much unlike they look"
2402,PART II.,To all the blurr’d Subscriptions in my Book;
2403,PART II.,"The Bridegroom’s Letters stand in row above,"
2404,PART II.,"Tapering yet stout, like Pine-trees in his Grove;"
2405,PART II.,"While free and fine the Bride’s appear below,"
2406,PART II.,As light and slender as her Jasmines grow;
2407,PART II.,"Mark now in what confusion, stoop or stand,"
2408,PART II.,"The crooked Scrawls of many a clownish Hand,"
2409,PART II.,"Now out, now in, they droop, they fall, they rise,"
2410,PART II.,Like raw Recruits drawn forth for Exercise;
2411,PART II.,"Ere yet reform’d and modell’d by the Drill,"
2412,PART II.,The free-born Legs stand striding as they will.
2413,PART II.,"Much have I tried to guide the Fist along,"
2414,PART II.,But still the Blunderers plac’d their Blottings wrong:
2415,PART II.,"Behold these Marks uncouth! how strange that men,"
2416,PART II.,"Who guide the Plough, should fail to guide the Pen;"
2417,PART II.,"For half a mile, the Furrows even lie;"
2418,PART II.,For half an inch the Letters stand awry;--
2419,PART II.,"Is it that, strong and sturdy in the Field,"
2420,PART II.,They scorn the Arms of idle men to wield;
2421,PART II.,"Or give that Hand to guide the Goosequill-tip,"
2422,PART II.,That rules a Team and brandishes a Whip?
2423,PART II.,"The Lions they, whom conscious powers forbid,"
2424,PART II.,To play the Ape and “dandle with the Kid.”
2425,PART II.,"But yet, small Arts have charms for Female Eyes;"
2426,PART II.,"Our Rustic Nymphs, the Beau and Scholar prize;"
2427,PART II.,"Unletter’d Swains and Plough-men coarse, they slight."
2428,PART II.,For those who dress and Amorous Scrolls indite.
2429,PART II.,
2430,PART II.,"For _Bridget Dawdle_ happier Days had been,"
2431,PART II.,Had Footman _Daniel_ scorn’d his native Green;
2432,PART II.,"Or when he came an idle Coxcomb down,"
2433,PART II.,Had he his Love reserv’d for Lass in Town;
2434,PART II.,"To _Roger Pluck_ she then had pledg’d her Truth,--"
2435,PART II.,"A sturdy, sober, kind, unpolish’d Youth;"
2436,PART II.,"But from the day, that fatal day she spied"
2437,PART II.,"The Pride of _Daniel_, _Daniel_ was her Pride."
2438,PART II.,"In all Concerns was _Roger_ just and true,            }"
2439,PART II.,"But coarse his Doublet was and patch’d in view,       }"
2440,PART II.,And Felt his Stockings were and blacker than his Shoe;}
2441,PART II.,"While _Daniel_’s Linen all was fine and fair,--"
2442,PART II.,His Master wore it and he deign’d to wear;--
2443,PART II.,"(To wear his Livery, some Respect might prove;"
2444,PART II.,"To wear his Linen, must be sign of Love;)"
2445,PART II.,"Blue was his Coat, unsoil’d by spot or stain;"
2446,PART II.,"His Hose were Silk, his Shoes of Spanish-grain;"
2447,PART II.,"A Silver Knot, his breadth of Shoulder bore;       }"
2448,PART II.,A Diamond Buckle blaz’d his Breast before;         }
2449,PART II.,Diamond he swore it was! and shew’d it as he swore:}
2450,PART II.,"Rings on his Fingers shone; his milk-white Hand,"
2451,PART II.,Could Pick-tooth Case and Box for Snuff command:
2452,PART II.,"And thus, with clouded Cane, a Fop complete,"
2453,PART II.,"He stalk’d, the jest and glory of the Street:"
2454,PART II.,"Join’d with these powers, he could so sweetly sing,"
2455,PART II.,Talk with such toss and saunter with such swing;
2456,PART II.,"Laugh with such Glee and trifle with such Art,"
2457,PART II.,"That _Bridget_’s Promise, fail’d to shield her Heart."
2458,PART II.,"_Roger_, meantime, to ease his amorous Cares,"
2459,PART II.,Fix’d his full mind upon his Farm’s Affairs;
2460,PART II.,"Two Pigs, a Cow, and Wethers half a Score,"
2461,PART II.,Increas’d his Stock and still he look’d for more;
2462,PART II.,"He, for his Acres few, so duly paid,"
2463,PART II.,That yet more Acres to his lot were laid;
2464,PART II.,"Till our chaste Nymphs no longer felt disdain,"
2465,PART II.,And prudent Matrons prais’d the frugal Swain;
2466,PART II.,"Who thriving well, through many a fruitful Year,"
2467,PART II.,"Now cloth’d himself anew, and acted Overseer."
2468,PART II.,"Just then poor _Bridget_ from her Friend in Town,"
2469,PART II.,"Fled in pure fear, and came a beggar down;"
2470,PART II.,"Trembling at _Roger_’s door, she knock’d for Bread,--     }"
2471,PART II.,"Was chidden first, next pitied, and then fed;             }"
2472,PART II.,"Then sat at _Roger_’s Board, then shar’d in _Roger_’s Bed:}"
2473,PART II.,"All Hope of Marriage lost in her Disgrace,"
2474,PART II.,"He mourns a Flame reviv’d, and she a love of Lace."
2475,PART II.,
2476,PART II.,"Now to be wed, a well-match’d Couple came;"
2477,PART II.,"Twice had old _Lodge_ been tied, and twice the Dame:"
2478,PART II.,"Tottering they came and toying, (odious scene!)"
2479,PART II.,"And fond and simple, as they’d always been."
2480,PART II.,"Children, from Wedlock we by Laws restrain;"
2481,PART II.,"Why not prevent them, when they’re such again?"
2482,PART II.,"Why not forbid the doating Souls, to prove,"
2483,PART II.,Th’ indecent Fondling of preposterous Love?
2484,PART II.,"In spite of Prudence, uncontroll’d by Shame,"
2485,PART II.,"The amorous Senior wooes the toothless Dame,"
2486,PART II.,"Relating idly, at the closing eye,"
2487,PART II.,The youthful Follies he disdains to leave;
2488,PART II.,"Till youthful Follies wake a transient Fire,"
2489,PART II.,"When arm in arm, they totter and retire."
2490,PART II.,"So a fond Pair of solemn Birds, all day,"
2491,PART II.,Blink in their seat and doze the hours away;
2492,PART II.,"Then by the Moon awaken’d, forth they move,"
2493,PART II.,"And fright the Songsters, with their cheerless Love."
2494,PART II.,"So two sear Trees, dry, stunted, and unsound,"
2495,PART II.,"Each other catch, when dropping to the ground;"
2496,PART II.,"Entwine their wither’d Arms ’gainst wind and weather,"
2497,PART II.,And shake their leafless Heads and drop together.
2498,PART II.,"So two dead Limbs, touch’d by Galvani’s Wire,"
2499,PART II.,Move with new life and feel awaken’d fire;
2500,PART II.,"Quivering awhile, their flaccid Forms remain,"
2501,PART II.,Then turn to cold torpidity again.
2502,PART II.,
2503,PART II.,"“But ever frowns your Hymen? Man and Maid,"

2507,PART II.,"These are with us, as in the World around;"
2508,PART II.,"They are not frequent, but they may be found."
2509,PART II.,"Our Farmers too, what though they fail to prove,"
2510,PART II.,"In Hymen’s Bonds, the tenderest Slaves of Love,"
2511,PART II.,"(Nor, like those Pairs whom Sentiment unites,"
2512,PART II.,Feel they the fervour of the Mind’s Delights;)
2513,PART II.,"Yet coarsely kind and comfortably gay,"
2514,PART II.,They heap the Board and hail the happy Day;
2515,PART II.,"And though the Bride, now freed from School, admits"
2516,PART II.,"Of Pride implanted there, some transient fits;"
2517,PART II.,"Yet soon she casts her girlish Flights aside,"
2518,PART II.,And in substantial Blessings rests her Pride.
2519,PART II.,"No more she plays, no more attempts to fit"
2520,PART II.,Her steps responsive to the squeaking Kit;
2521,PART II.,"No more recites her French, the Hinds among,"
2522,PART II.,But chides her Maidens in her mother-tongue;
2523,PART II.,"Her Tambour-frame she leaves and Diet spare,"
2524,PART II.,Plain-work and Plenty with her House to share;
2525,PART II.,"Till, all her Varnish lost, in few short years,"
2526,PART II.,"In all her Worth, the Farmer’s Wife appears."
2527,PART II.,Yet not the ancient Kind; nor she who gave

2551,PART II.,Heav’n gives a Heart to hail the Marriage Band;

2553,PART II.,Who much to Love and more to Prudence owe:
2554,PART II.,"_Reuben_ and _Rachel_, though as fond as Doves,"
2555,PART II.,Were yet discreet and cautious in their Loves;
2556,PART II.,"Nor would attend to _Cupid_’s wild Commands,"
2557,PART II.,Till cool Reflection bade them join their Hands;
2558,PART II.,"When both were poor, they thought it argued ill"
2559,PART II.,Of hasty Love to make them poorer still;
2560,PART II.,"Year after year, with Savings long laid by,"
2561,PART II.,They bought the future Dwelling’s full Supply:
2562,PART II.,"Her frugal Fancy cull’d the smaller Ware,"
2563,PART II.,The weightier Purchase ask’d her _Reuben_’s Care;
2564,PART II.,"Together then their last Year’s Gain they threw,"
2565,PART II.,"And lo! an auction’d Bed, with Curtains neat and new."
2566,PART II.,"Thus both, as Prudence counsell’d, wisely stay’d,"
2567,PART II.,And cheerful then the Calls of Love obey’d:
2568,PART II.,"What if, when _Rachel_ gave her Hand, ’twas one"
2569,PART II.,Embrown’d by Winter’s Ice and Summer’s Sun;
2570,PART II.,"What if, in _Reuben_’s Hair, the female Eye"
2571,PART II.,Usurping Grey among the Black could spy;
2572,PART II.,"What if in both, Life’s bloomy Flush was lost,"
2573,PART II.,And their full Autumn felt the mellowing Frost;
2574,PART II.,"Yet Time, who blow’d the Rose of Youth away,"
2575,PART II.,Had left the vigorous Stem without decay;

2849,PART III.,Cut the good Cord--a Traitor of the Gang.
2850,PART III.,"His own Exploits, with boastful glee, he told,"

2859,PART III.,Or drive a third-day Drunkard from his Ale;
2860,PART III.,"What were his Triumphs and how great the Skill,"
2861,PART III.,That won the vex’d Virago to his Will;
2862,PART III.,"Who raving came;--then talk’d in milder strain,--"
2863,PART III.,"Then wept,--then drank and pledg’d her Spouse again."
2864,PART III.,"Such were his Themes: how Knaves o’er Laws prevail,"

2866,PART III.,"The Young how brave, how subtle were the Old:"
2867,PART III.,And Oaths attested all that Folly told.
2868,PART III.,"On Death like his what name shall we bestow,"
2869,PART III.,So very sudden! yet so very slow?

2885,PART III.,"Like that great man’s, who to his SAVIOUR came,"

2887,PART III.,"“Come,” if she said, they came; if “go,” were gone;"
2888,PART III.,"And if “do this,”--that instant it was done:"

2891,PART III.,"No Parish-Business in the Place could stir,"
2892,PART III.,Without Direction or Assent from her;
2893,PART III.,In turn she took each Office as it fell;
2894,PART III.,Knew all their Duties and discharg’d them well;
2895,PART III.,"The lazy Vagrants in her presence shook,"
2896,PART III.,And pregnant Damsels fear’d her stern Rebuke;
2897,PART III.,"She look’d on Want, with Judgment, clear and cool,"
2898,PART III.,And felt with Reason and bestow’d by Rule:
2899,PART III.,"She match’d both Sons and Daughters to her mind,"
2900,PART III.,"And lent them Eyes, for Love, she heard, was blind;"
2901,PART III.,"Yet ceaseless still she throve, alert, alive,"
2902,PART III.,"The working Bee, in full or empty Hive;"
2903,PART III.,"Busy and careful, like that working Bee,"
2904,PART III.,No time for Love nor tender Cares had she;
2905,PART III.,"But when our Farmers made their amorous Vows,"
2906,PART III.,She talk’d of Market-Steeds and Patent-Ploughs.
2907,PART III.,"Not unemploy’d her Evenings pass’d away,"
2908,PART III.,"Amusement clos’d, as Business wak’d the Day;"
2909,PART III.,"When to her Toilet’s brief Concern she ran,"
2910,PART III.,"And conversation with her Friends, began;"
2911,PART III.,"Who all were welcome at her Board to share,"
2912,PART III.,And joyous Neighbours prais’d her Christmas Fare;
2913,PART III.,"That none around might, in their scorn, complain"
2914,PART III.,Of Gossip _Goe_ as greedy in her Gain.
2915,PART III.,"Thus long she reign’d, admir’d, if not approv’d;"
2916,PART III.,"Prais’d, if not honour’d; fear’d, if not belov’d;--"
2917,PART III.,"When, as the busy Days of Spring drew near,"
2918,PART III.,That call’d for all the Forecast of the Year;
2919,PART III.,"When lively Hope the rising Crops survey’d,"
2920,PART III.,And April promis’d what September pay’d;
2921,PART III.,When stray’d her Lambs where _Gorse_ and _Greenweed_ grow;
2922,PART III.,When rose her Grass in richer Vales below;
2923,PART III.,"When pleas’d she look’d on all the smiling Land, }"
2924,PART III.,"And view’d the Hinds, who wrought at her command,}"
2925,PART III.,As _Bridget_ churn’d the Butter for her Hand;    }
2926,PART III.,"(Geese, Hens, and Turkeys following where she went;)"

2928,PART III.,"“Bless me! I die and not a Warning giv’n,--"
2929,PART III.,“With _much_ to do on Earth and ALL for Heav’n!

2934,PART III.,"“A Lawyer haste, and in your way, a Priest;"
2935,PART III.,“And let me die in one good Work at least.”
2936,PART III.,"She spake and, trembling, dropp’d upon her knees,"
2937,PART III.,Heaven in her Eye and in her Hand her Keys:
2938,PART III.,"And still the more she found her Life decay,"
2939,PART III.,With greater force she grasp’d those Signs of Sway:
2940,PART III.,"Then fell and died!... In haste her Sons drew near,"
2941,PART III.,"And dropp’d, in haste, the tributary Tear,"
2942,PART III.,"Then from th’ adhering Clasp the Keys unbound,"
2943,PART III.,"And Consolation for their Sorrows, found."
2944,PART III.,

2946,PART III.,Strikes from the Baby-cheek the rosy Charm;

2950,PART III.,"When three Days’ Life, in feeble Cries, were spent;"
2951,PART III.,"In Pain brought forth, those painful Hours to stay,"
2952,PART III.,To breathe in Pain and sigh its Soul away!
2953,PART III.,"“But why thus lent, if thus recall’d again,"
2954,PART III.,"“To cause and feel, to live and die in, Pain?”"
2955,PART III.,"Or rather say, Why grievous these appear,"
2956,PART III.,If all it pays for Heaven’s eternal Year;

2958,PART III.,"Delights that live, when Worlds no more endure?"
2959,PART III.,"The Sister-spirit long may lodge below,"
2960,PART III.,"And Pains from Nature, Pains from Reason, know;"

2962,PART III.,By Hope perverted and by Love undone;
2963,PART III.,"A Wife’s Distress, a Mother’s Pangs, may dread,"
2964,PART III.,"And Widow-tears, in bitter Anguish, shed;"
2965,PART III.,"May at Old Age arrive through numerous Harms,"
2966,PART III.,With Children’s Children in those feeble Arms;
2967,PART III.,"Nor till by Years of Want and Grief opprest,"
2968,PART III.,Shall the sad Spirit flee and be at rest!
2969,PART III.,"Yet happier therefore shall we deem the Boy,"
2970,PART III.,Secur’d from anxious Care and dangerous Joy?
2971,PART III.,"Not so! for then would Love Divine, in vain"

2986,PART III.,Next died the LADY who yon Hall possess’d;
2987,PART III.,And here they brought her noble Bones to rest.
2988,PART III.,In Town she dwelt;--forsaken stood the Hall.
2989,PART III.,"Worms ate the Floors, the Tap’stry fled the Wall:"
2990,PART III.,No Fire the Kitchen’s cheerless Grate display’d;
2991,PART III.,No cheerful Light the long-clos’d Sash convey’d!

3000,PART III.,Where Tenants follow’d to complain and pay;
3001,PART III.,"Yet no complaint before the _Lady_ came,"
3002,PART III.,The feeling Servant spar’d the feeble Dame;
3003,PART III.,"Who saw her Farms with his observing Eyes,"
3004,PART III.,And answer’d all Requests with his Replies:--
3005,PART III.,"She came not down, her falling Groves to view;"
3006,PART III.,"Why should she know, what One so faithful knew?"
3007,PART III.,"Why come, from many clamorous Tongues to hear,"
3008,PART III.,What One so just might whisper in her Ear?
3009,PART III.,"Her Oaks or Acres, why with care explore;"
3010,PART III.,"Why learn the Wants, the Sufferings of the Poor;"
3011,PART III.,"When One so knowing all their Worth could trace,"
3012,PART III.,And One so piteous govern’d in her Place?
3013,PART III.,"Lo! now, what dismal Sons of Darkness come,"
3014,PART III.,To bear this Daughter of Indulgence home;
3015,PART III.,Tragedians all and well arrang’d in Black!
3016,PART III.,"Who Nature, Feeling, Force, Expression lack;--"
3017,PART III.,"Who cause no Tear, but gloomily pass by,"
3018,PART III.,"And shake their Sables in the wearied Eye,"
3019,PART III.,"That turns disgusted from the pompous Scene,"
3020,PART III.,"Proud without Grandeur, with Profusion, mean!"
3021,PART III.,The Tear for Kindness past Affection owes;
3022,PART III.,For Worth deceas’d the Sigh from Reason flows;
3023,PART III.,"E’en well-feign’d Passion for our Sorrows call,"
3024,PART III.,And real Tears for mimic Miseries fall:--
3025,PART III.,"But this poor Farce has neither Truth nor Art,"
3026,PART III.,To please the Fancy or to touch the Heart;
3027,PART III.,"Unlike the Darkness of the Sky, that pours"
3028,PART III.,On the dry Ground its fertilizing Showers!
3029,PART III.,"Unlike to that which strikes the Soul with dread,"
3030,PART III.,When Thunders roar and forky Fires are shed;
3031,PART III.,"Dark but not aweful, dismal but yet mean,"
3032,PART III.,With anxious Bustle moves the cumbrous Scene;
3033,PART III.,"Presents no Objects, tender or profound,"
3034,PART III.,But spreads its cold unmeaning Gloom around.
3035,PART III.,"When Woes are feign’d, how ill such forms appear,"
3036,PART III.,"And oh! how needless, when the Woe’s sincere."
3037,PART III.,"Slow to the Vault they come with heavy tread,"
3038,PART III.,Bending beneath the _Lady_ and her Lead;
3039,PART III.,"A Case of Elm surrounds that ponderous Chest,"
3040,PART III.,Close on that Case the Crimson Velvet’s press’d;
3041,PART III.,"Ungenerous this, that to the Worm denies,"
3042,PART III.,With niggard-caution his appointed Prize;
3043,PART III.,"For now, ere yet he works his tedious way,"
3044,PART III.,Through Cloth and Wood and Metal to his Prey;
3045,PART III.,"That Prey dissolving shall a Mass remain,"
3046,PART III.,That Fancy loaths and Worms themselves disdain.
3047,PART III.,"But see! the Master-Mourner makes his way,"
3048,PART III.,To end his Office for the coffin’d Clay;
3049,PART III.,Pleas’d that our Rustic Men and Maids behold
3050,PART III.,"His Plate like Silver, and his Studds like Gold;"
3051,PART III.,"As they approach to spell the Age, the Name,"
3052,PART III.,And all the Titles of th’ illustrious Dame.--
3053,PART III.,"This as (my Duty done) some Scholar read,"
3054,PART III.,A Village-Father look’d disdain and said:
3055,PART III.,"“Away, my Friends! why take such pains to know,"
3056,PART III.,“What some brave Marble soon in Church shall show:
3057,PART III.,"“Where not alone her gracious Name shall stand,"
3058,PART III.,“But how she liv’d the Blessing of the Land;
3059,PART III.,"“How much we all deplor’d the noble Dead,"
3060,PART III.,“What Groans we utter’d and what Tears we shed;
3061,PART III.,"“Tears, true as those, which in the sleepy Eyes"
3062,PART III.,“Of weeping Cherubs on the Stone shall rise:
3063,PART III.,"“Tears, true as those, which, ere she found her Grave,"
3064,PART III.,“The noble _Lady_ to our Sorrows gave.”--
3065,PART III.,Down by the Church-way-Walk and where the Brook
3066,PART III.,Winds round the Chancel like a Shepherd’s Crook;
3067,PART III.,"In that small House, with those green Pales before,"
3068,PART III.,Where Jasmine trails on either side the Door;
3069,PART III.,"Where those dark Shrubs that now grow wild at will,"
3070,PART III.,Were clipt in form and tantaliz’d with skill;
3071,PART III.,"Where Cockles blanch’d and Pebbles neatly spread,"
3072,PART III.,Form’d shining Borders for the Larkspurs’ Bed;--
3073,PART III.,"There liv’d a _Lady_, wise, austere and nice,"
3074,PART III.,Who shew’d her Virtue by her Scorn of Vice;
3075,PART III.,"In the dear Fashions of her Youth she dress’d,"
3076,PART III.,A pea-green _Joseph_ was her favourite Vest;
3077,PART III.,"Erect she stood, she walk’d with stately Mien,"
3078,PART III.,Tight was her length of Stays and she was tall and lean.
3079,PART III.,"There long she liv’d in Maiden-state immur’d,"
3080,PART III.,From Looks of Love and treacherous Man secur’d:
3081,PART III.,Though Evil-fame--(but that was long before)
3082,PART III.,Had blown her dubious Blast at _Catharine_’s Door:
3083,PART III.,"A Captain thither, rich from _India_ came,"
3084,PART III.,"And though a Cousin call’d, it touch’d her Fame;"
3085,PART III.,"Her annual Stipend rose from his Behest,"
3086,PART III.,"And all the long-priz’d Treasures, she possess’d:--"
3087,PART III.,"If aught like Joy a while appear’d to stay,"
3088,PART III.,In that stern Face and chase those Frowns away;
3089,PART III.,"’Twas when her Treasures she dispos’d for view,"
3090,PART III.,"And heard the Praises, to their Splendour due;"
3091,PART III.,"Silks beyond Price, so rich they’d stand alone,"
3092,PART III.,And Diamonds blazing on the buckled Zone;
3093,PART III.,"Rows of rare Pearls by curious Workmen set,"
3094,PART III.,And Bracelets fair in Box of glossy Jet;
3095,PART III.,"Bright polish’d Amber precious from its Size,"
3096,PART III.,"Or forms, the fairest Fancy could devise;"
3097,PART III.,"Her Drawers of Cedar shut with secret Springs,"
3098,PART III.,Conceal’d the Watch of Gold and rubied Rings;
3099,PART III.,"Letters, long Proofs of Love and Verses fine"
3100,PART III.,Round the pink’d Rims of crisped Valentine.
3101,PART III.,"Her China-Closet, cause of daily Care,"
3102,PART III.,For Woman’s Wonder held her pencill’d Ware;
3103,PART III.,"That pictur’d Wealth of _China_ and _Japan_,"
3104,PART III.,"Like its cold Mistress, shunn’d the Eye of Man."
3105,PART III.,"Her neat small Room, adorn’d with Maiden-taste,"
3106,PART III.,A clipt French-Puppey first of Favourites grac’d.
3107,PART III.,"A Parrot next, but dead and stuff’d with Art;"
3108,PART III.,"(For Poll, when living, lost the Lady’s Heart,"
3109,PART III.,And then his Life; for he was heard to speak
3110,PART III.,Such frightful Words as tinge’d his Lady’s Cheek;)
3111,PART III.,"Unhappy Bird! who had no power to prove,"
3112,PART III.,"Save by such Speech, his Gratitude and Love."
3113,PART III.,A grey old Cat his Whiskers lick’d beside;
3114,PART III.,A type of Sadness in the House of Pride.
3115,PART III.,"The polish’d Surface of an India-Chest,"
3116,PART III.,"A glassy Globe, in Frame of Ivory, prest;"
3117,PART III.,"Where swam two finny Creatures; one of Gold,"
3118,PART III.,Of Silver one; both beauteous to behold:
3119,PART III.,All these were form’d the guiding Taste to suit;
3120,PART III.,The Beasts well-manner’d and the Fishes mute.
3121,PART III.,"A widow’d _Aunt_ was there, compell’d by Need,"
3122,PART III.,The Nymph to flatter and her Tribe to feed;
3123,PART III.,"Who, veiling well her Scorn, endur’d the Clog,"
3124,PART III.,Mute as the Fish and fawning as the Dog.
3125,PART III.,"As Years increas’d, these Treasures her Delight,"
3126,PART III.,Arose in Value in their Owner’s sight:--
3127,PART III.,"A Miser knows that, view it as he will,"
3128,PART III.,A Guinea kept is but a Guinea still:
3129,PART III.,"And so he puts it to its proper Use,"
3130,PART III.,That something more this Guinea may produce:
3131,PART III.,"But Silks and Rings in the Possessor’s Eyes,"
3132,PART III.,"The oft’ner seen, the more in Value rise,"
3133,PART III.,"And thus are wisely hoarded to bestow,"
3134,PART III.,"On Pride that governs, Pleasure that will grow."
3135,PART III.,"But what avail’d their Worth,--if Worth had they,--"
3136,PART III.,In the sad Summer of her slow Decay?
3137,PART III.,Then we beheld her turn an anxious Look
3138,PART III.,"From Trunks and Chests, and fix it on her Book;"
3139,PART III.,"A rich-bound Book of Prayer the Captain gave,"
3140,PART III.,"(Some Princess had it, or was said to have,)"
3141,PART III.,"And then once more on all her Stores, look round"
3142,PART III.,"And draw a sigh so piteous and profound,"
3143,PART III.,"That told, “Alas! how hard from these to part,"
3144,PART III.,“And for new Hopes and Habits form the Heart!
3145,PART III.,"“What shall I do (she cried) my Peace of Mind,"
3146,PART III.,“To gain in dying and to die resign’d?”
3147,PART III.,"‘Hear,’ we return’d;--‘these Bawbles cast aside,"
3148,PART III.,‘Nor give thy GOD a Rival in thy Pride;
3149,PART III.,‘Thy Closets shut and ope thy Kitchen’s Door;
3150,PART III.,"‘_There_ own thy Failings, _here_ invite the Poor;"
3151,PART III.,"‘A friend of _Mammon_ let thy Bounty make, }"
3152,PART III.,"‘For Widow’s Prayers, thy Vanities forsake;}"
3153,PART III.,"‘And let the Hungry of thy Pride, partake: }"
3154,PART III.,"‘Then shall thy inward Eye with joy survey,"
3155,PART III.,‘The Angel _Mercy_ tempering _Death_’s Delay!’
3156,PART III.,"Alas! ’twas hard; the Treasures still had Charms,"
3157,PART III.,"Hope still its Flattery, Sickness its Alarms;"
3158,PART III.,"Still was the same unsettled, clouded View,"
3159,PART III.,"And the same plaintive Cry, “What shall I do?”"
3160,PART III.,"Nor Change appear’d: for, when her Race was run"
3161,PART III.,"Doubtful we all exclaim’d, “What has been done?”"
3162,PART III.,Apart she liv’d and still she lies alone;
3163,PART III.,"Yon earthly Heap awaits the flattering Stone,"
3164,PART III.,On which Invention shall be long employ’d
3165,PART III.,To shew the various Worth of _Catharine Lloyd_.
3166,PART III.,
3167,PART III.,"Next to these Ladies, but in nought allied,"
3168,PART III.,"A noble Peasant, _Isaac Ashford_, died."
3169,PART III.,"Noble he was, contemning all things mean,"
3170,PART III.,His Truth unquestion’d and his Soul serene:
3171,PART III.,Of no man’s presence _Isaac_ felt afraid;
3172,PART III.,"At no Man’s question, _Isaac_ look’d dismay’d:"
3173,PART III.,"Shame knew him not, he dreaded no Disgrace;"
3174,PART III.,"Truth, simple Truth, was written in his Face;"
3175,PART III.,"Yet while the serious Thought his Soul approv’d,"
3176,PART III.,Cheerful he seem’d and Gentleness he lov’d:
3177,PART III.,"To Bliss domestic he his Heart resign’d,"
3178,PART III.,"And with the firmest, had the fondest Mind:"
3179,PART III.,"Were others joyful, he look’d smiling on,"
3180,PART III.,And gave Allowance where he needed none;
3181,PART III.,"Good he refus’d with future Ill to buy,"
3182,PART III.,Nor knew a Joy that caus’d Reflection’s Sigh;
3183,PART III.,"A Friend to Virtue, his unclouded Breast"
3184,PART III.,"No Envy stung, no Jealousy distress’d;"
3185,PART III.,"(Bane of the Poor! it wounds their weaker Mind,"
3186,PART III.,"To miss one Favour, which their Neighbours find:)"
3187,PART III.,Yet far was he from Stoic-pride remov’d;
3188,PART III.,"He felt humanely, and he warmly lov’d:"
3189,PART III.,"I mark’d his Action, when his Infant died,"
3190,PART III.,And his old Neighbour for Offence was tried;
3191,PART III.,"The still Tears, stealing down that furrow’d Cheek,"
3192,PART III.,"Spoke Pity, plainer than the Tongue can speak."
3193,PART III.,"If Pride were his, ’twas not their Vulgar Pride,"
3194,PART III.,"Who, in their base Contempt, the Great deride;"
3195,PART III.,"Nor Pride in Learning, though my Clerk agreed,"
3196,PART III.,"If Fate should call him, _Ashford_ might succeed;"
3197,PART III.,"Nor Pride in Rustic-skill, although we knew,"
3198,PART III.,"None his Superior, and his Equals, few:"
3199,PART III.,"But if that Spirit in his Soul had place,"
3200,PART III.,It was the jealous Pride that shuns Disgrace;
3201,PART III.,"A Pride in honest Fame, by Virtue gain’d,"
3202,PART III.,In sturdy Boys to virtuous Labours train’d;
3203,PART III.,"Pride, in the Power that guards his Country’s Coast,"
3204,PART III.,And all that Englishmen enjoy and boast;
3205,PART III.,"Pride, in a Life that Slander’s Tongue defy’d,"
3206,PART III.,"In fact, a noble Passion, misnam’d _Pride_."
3207,PART III.,"He had no party’s Rage, no Sect’ry’s Whim;"
3208,PART III.,Christian and Countryman was _all_ with him:
3209,PART III.,"True to his Church he came; no Sunday-Shower,"
3210,PART III.,Kept him at home in that important Hour;
3211,PART III.,"Nor his firm Feet could one persuading Sect,"
3212,PART III.,By the strong glare of their new Light direct;
3213,PART III.,"“On hope, in mine own sober Light, I gaze,"
3214,PART III.,"“But should be blind and lose it, in your Blaze.”"
3215,PART III.,"In Times severe, when many a sturdy Swain,"
3216,PART III.,"Felt it his Pride, his Comfort, to complain;"
3217,PART III.,"_Isaac_ their Wants would soothe, his own would hide,"
3218,PART III.,"And feel in _that_, his Comfort and his Pride."
3219,PART III.,"At length, he found, when Seventy Years were run,"
3220,PART III.,His Strength departed and his Labour done;
3221,PART III.,"When, save his honest Fame, he kept no more;"
3222,PART III.,But lost his Wife and saw his Children poor;
3223,PART III.,"’Twas then, a Spark of--say not Discontent--"
3224,PART III.,Struck on his Mind and thus he gave it vent:--
3225,PART III.,"“Kind are your Laws, (’tis not to be denied,)"
3226,PART III.,"“That in yon House, for ruin’d Age, provide,"
3227,PART III.,"“And they are just;--when young, we give you all,"
3228,PART III.,“And then for Comforts in our Weakness call.--
3229,PART III.,"“Why then this proud Reluctance to be fed,"
3230,PART III.,“To join your Poor and eat the Parish-Bread?
3231,PART III.,"“But yet I linger, loath with him to feed,"
3232,PART III.,“Who gains his Plenty by the Sons of Need;
3233,PART III.,"“He who, by Contract, all your Paupers took,"
3234,PART III.,“And guages Stomachs with an anxious Look:
3235,PART III.,“On some old Master I could well depend;
3236,PART III.,“See him with joy and thank him as a Friend;
3237,PART III.,"“But ill on him, who doles the Day’s Supply,"
3238,PART III.,"“And counts our Chances, who at Night may die:"
3239,PART III.,“Yet help me Heav’n! and let me not complain
3240,PART III.,"“Of what befalls me, but the fate sustain.”"
3241,PART III.,"Such were his Thoughts, and so resign’d he grew;"
3242,PART III.,Daily he plac’d the Workhouse in his view!
3243,PART III.,"But came not there, for sudden was his Fate,"
3244,PART III.,"He dropp’d expiring, at his Cottage-gate."
3245,PART III.,"I feel his Absence in the Hours of Prayer,"
3246,PART III.,And view his Seat and sigh for _Isaac_ there;
3247,PART III.,"I see no more those white Locks thinly spread,"
3248,PART III.,Round the bald Polish of that honour’d Head;
3249,PART III.,No more that aweful Glance on playful Wight
3250,PART III.,Compell’d to kneel and tremble at the sight;
3251,PART III.,"To fold his Fingers all in dread the while,"
3252,PART III.,Till Mister _Ashford_ soften’d to a Smile;
3253,PART III.,"No more that meek and suppliant Look in Prayer,"
3254,PART III.,Nor the pure Faith (to give it force) are there:--
3255,PART III.,"But he is blest and I lament no more,"
3256,PART III.,A wise good Man contented to be poor.
3257,PART III.,
3258,PART III.,Then died a Rambler; not the One who sails
3259,PART III.,"And trucks, for Female Favours, Beads and Nails;"
3260,PART III.,"Not One, who posts from place to place--of Men"
3261,PART III.,And Manners treating with a flying Pen:
3262,PART III.,"Not he, who climbs, for Prospects, _Snowden_’s Height,"
3263,PART III.,And chides the Clouds that intercept the Sight;
3264,PART III.,"No curious Shell, rare Plant or brilliant Spar,"
3265,PART III.,"Intic’d our Traveller, from his Home, so far;"
3266,PART III.,"But all the Reason, by himself assign’d"
3267,PART III.,"For so much Rambling, was, a restless Mind;"
3268,PART III.,"As on, from place to place, without intent,"
3269,PART III.,"Without Reflection, _Robin Dingley_ went."
3270,PART III.,Not thus by Nature:--never Man was found
3271,PART III.,Less prone to wander from his Parish-bound;
3272,PART III.,"_Claudian_’s old Man, to whom all Scenes were new,"
3273,PART III.,"Save those where he and where his Apples grew,"
3274,PART III.,"Resembled _Robin_, who around would look,"
3275,PART III.,"And his Horizon, for the Earth’s mistook."
3276,PART III.,To this poor Swain a keen Attorney came;--
3277,PART III.,"“I give thee joy, good Fellow! on thy Name;"
3278,PART III.,"“The rich old _Dingley_’s dead;--no Child has he,"
3279,PART III.,“Nor Wife nor Will; his ALL is left for thee;
3280,PART III.,“To be his Fortune’s Heir thy Claim is good;
3281,PART III.,“Thou hast the Name and we will prove the Blood.”
3282,PART III.,"The Claim was made; ’twas tried, it would not stand;"
3283,PART III.,"They prov’d the Blood, but were refus’d the Land."
3284,PART III.,"Assur’d of Wealth, this Man of simple Heart,"
3285,PART III.,To every Friend had predispos’d a Part;
3286,PART III.,"His Wife, had Hopes indulg’d of various kind;"
3287,PART III.,"The three Miss _Dingley’s_ had their School assign’d,"
3288,PART III.,"Masters were sought for what each Miss requir’d,"
3289,PART III.,And Books were bought and Harpsichords were hir’d;
3290,PART III.,"So high was Hope:--the Failure touch’d his Brain,"
3291,PART III.,And _Robin_ never was himself again:
3292,PART III.,"Yet he no wrath, no angry wish express’d,"
3293,PART III.,"But tried in vain, to labour or to rest;"
3294,PART III.,"Then cast his Bundle on his back, and went"
3295,PART III.,He knew not whither nor for what Intent.
3296,PART III.,"Years fled;--of _Robin_ all Remembrance past,"
3297,PART III.,When home he wander’d in his Rags at last:
3298,PART III.,"A Sailor’s Jacket on his Limbs was thrown,"
3299,PART III.,A Sailor’s Story he had made his own;
3300,PART III.,"Had suffer’d Battles, Prisons, Tempests, Storms,"
3301,PART III.,Encountering Death in all his ugliest forms;
3302,PART III.,"His Cheeks were haggard, hollow was his Eye,"
3303,PART III.,"Where Madness lurk’d, conceal’d in Misery;"
3304,PART III.,"Want, and th’ ungentle World, had taught a part,"
3305,PART III.,And prompted Cunning to that simple Heart:
3306,PART III.,"“He now bethought him, he would roam no more,"
3307,PART III.,“But live at Home and labour as before.”
3308,PART III.,"Here cloth’d and fed, no sooner he began"
3309,PART III.,"To round and redden, than away he ran:"
3310,PART III.,"His Wife was dead, their Children past his aid;"
3311,PART III.,"So, unmolested from his Home he stray’d:"
3312,PART III.,"Six Years elasp’d, when, worn with Want and Pain,"
3313,PART III.,"Came _Robin_, wrapt in all his Rags, again:--"
3314,PART III.,"We chide, we pity;--plac’d among our Poor,"
3315,PART III.,He fed again and was a Man once more.
3316,PART III.,"As when a gaunt and hungry Fox is found,"
3317,PART III.,Entrapp’d alive in some rich Hunter’s ground;
3318,PART III.,"Fed for the Field, although each Day’s a Feast,"
3319,PART III.,"_Fatten_ you may, but never _tame_ the Beast;"
3320,PART III.,"An House protects him, savoury Viands sustain;"
3321,PART III.,But loose his neck and off he goes again:
3322,PART III.,"So stole our Vagrant from his warm Retreat,"
3323,PART III.,To rove a Prowler and be deem’d a Cheat.
3324,PART III.,"Hard was his Fare: for, him at length we saw,"
3325,PART III.,In Cart convey’d and laid supine on Straw:
3326,PART III.,His feeble Voice now spoke a sinking Heart;
3327,PART III.,His Groans now told the Motions of the Cart:
3328,PART III.,"And thus he rose, but tried in vain to stand;"
3329,PART III.,Clos’d was his Eye and clench’d his clammy Hand;
3330,PART III.,"Life ebb’d apace and our best Aid, no more,"
3331,PART III.,Could his weak Sense or dying Heart restore:--
3332,PART III.,"But now he fell, a Victim to the Snare,"
3333,PART III.,That vile Attorneys for the Weak prepare;--
3334,PART III.,"They who, when Profit or Resentment call,"
3335,PART III.,Heed not the groaning Victim they enthrall.
3336,PART III.,
3337,PART III.,"Then died lamented, in the Strength of Life,"
3338,PART III.,A valued _Mother_ and a faithful _Wife_;
3339,PART III.,"Call’d not away, when Time had loos’d each Hold"
3340,PART III.,On the fond Heart and each Desire grew cold;
3341,PART III.,"But when, to all that knit us to our Kind,"
3342,PART III.,"She felt fast-bound, as Charity can bind;--"
3343,PART III.,"Not when the Ills of Age, its Pain, its Care,"
3344,PART III.,The drooping Spirit for its Fate prepare;
3345,PART III.,"And, each Affection failing, leaves the Heart"
3346,PART III.,Loos’d from Life’s Charm and willing to depart;--
3347,PART III.,"But ALL her Ties the strong Invader broke,"
3348,PART III.,"In all their Strength, by one tremendous Stroke!"
3349,PART III.,"Sudden and swift the eager Pest came on,"
3350,PART III.,"And all was Terror, till all Hope was gone;"
3351,PART III.,"Was silent Terror, where that Hope grew weak,"
3352,PART III.,Look’d on the Sick and was asham’d to speak.--
3353,PART III.,"Slowly they bore, with solemn Step, the Dead;"
3354,PART III.,When Grief grew loud and bitter Tears were shed:
3355,PART III.,"My Part began; a Crowd drew near the Place,"
3356,PART III.,"Awe in each Eye, Alarm in every Face:"
3357,PART III.,"So swift the Ill! and of so fierce a kind,"
3358,PART III.,"That Fear with Pity, mingled in each Mind;"
3359,PART III.,Friends with the Husband came their Griefs to blend;

3366,PART III.,Swell’d the full Cadence of the Grief by Groans.
3367,PART III.,"The elder Sister strove her Pangs to hide,"

3381,PART III.,"The Sunday-pew, she fill’d with all her Race,"

3409,PART III.,To that poor Village where she deign’d to live:
3410,PART III.,"Some few Months past, she sent in hour of Need,"

3493,PART III.,"“Is this a Landman’s Love? Be certain then,"
3494,PART III.,"“We part for ever!”--and they cried, ‘Amen!’"
3495,PART III.,"His Words were Truth’s:--Some forty Summers fled,"
3496,PART III.,His Brethren died; his Kin suppos’d him dead:
3497,PART III.,"Three Nephews these, one sprightly Niece, and one,"
3498,PART III.,Less near in Blood; they call’d him _surly John_;
3499,PART III.,"He work’d in Woods apart from all his Kind,"
3500,PART III.,Fierce were his Looks and moody was his Mind.
3501,PART III.,"For Home, the _Sailor_ now began to sigh;--"

3509,PART III.,"Now all his Kindred,--neither rich nor poor,"

3511,PART III.,"In piteous plight he knock’d at _George_’s Gate,"
3512,PART III.,"And begg’d for Aid, as he describ’d his State:--"
3513,PART III.,"But stern was _George_:--‘Let them who had thee Strong,"

3518,PART III.,Was “_Rascal!_” rising with disdainful note.
3519,PART III.,To pious _James_ he then his Prayer address’d;--
3520,PART III.,"‘Good-lack,’ quoth _James_, ‘thy Sorrows pierce my breast;"

3526,PART III.,His Case to _Peter_;--_Peter_ too was cold:--
3527,PART III.,‘The Rates are high; we have a-many Poor;
3528,PART III.,"‘But I will think,----’ he said, and shut the Door."
3529,PART III.,"Then the gay _Niece_, the seeming Pauper press’d;--"
3530,PART III.,"“Turn, _Nancy_, turn, and view this Form distrest;"
3531,PART III.,"“Akin to thine is this declining Frame,"
3532,PART III.,“And this poor Beggar claims an _Uncle_’s Name.”

3536,PART III.,‘Oh! that I saw thee starving in the Stocks!’
3537,PART III.,“My gentle Niece!” he said;--and sought the Wood.--

3548,PART III.,"“And that prim Shrew shall, envying, hear our Joys.”--"
3549,PART III.,"“Tobacco’s glorious Fume, all Day we’ll share,"
3550,PART III.,"“With Beef and Brandy kill all kinds of Care,"
3551,PART III.,"“We’ll Beer and Biscuit on our Table heap,"
3552,PART III.,"“And rail at Rascals, till we fall asleep.”"
3553,PART III.,"Such was their Life: but when the Woodman died,"
3554,PART III.,His grieving Kin for _Roger_’s Smiles applied;--
3555,PART III.,"In vain; he shut, with stern Rebuke, the Door,"
3556,PART III.,"And dying, built a Refuge for the Poor;"
3557,PART III.,"With this Restriction, That no _Cuff_ should share"
3558,PART III.,One Meal or shelter for one Moment there.
3559,PART III.,
3560,PART III.,My Record ends:--But hark! ev’n now I hear
3561,PART III.,The Bell of Death and know not whose to fear:
3562,PART III.,Our Farmers all and all our Hinds were well;
3563,PART III.,"In no Man’s Cottage, Danger seem’d to dwell:--"
3564,PART III.,"Yet Death of Man proclaim these heavy Chimes,"
3565,PART III.,"For thrice they sound, with pausing space, three times."
3566,PART III.,"“Go; of my Sexton seek, Whose Days are sped?”----"
3567,PART III.,"“What! he, himself!--and is old _Dibble_ dead?”"
3568,PART III.,"His Eightieth Year he reach’d, still undecay’d,"
3569,PART III.,And Rectors five to one close Vault convey’d:--
3570,PART III.,"But he is gone; his Care and Skill I lose,"
3571,PART III.,And gain a mournful Subject for my Muse:
3572,PART III.,"His Masters lost, he’d oft in turn deplore,"
3573,PART III.,"And kindly add,--‘Heaven grant, I lose no more!’"
3574,PART III.,"Yet while he spake, a sly and pleasant Glance"
3575,PART III.,Appear’d at variance with his Complaisance:
3576,PART III.,"For, as he told their Fate and varying Worth,"
3577,PART III.,"He archly look’d,--‘I yet may bear thee forth.’"
3578,PART III.,"“When first”--(he so began)--“my Trade I ply’d,"
3579,PART III.,“Good Master _Addle_ was the Parish-Guide;
3580,PART III.,"“His Clerk and Sexton, I beheld with fear"
3581,PART III.,“His Stride majestic and his Frown severe;
3582,PART III.,"“A noble Pillar of the Church he stood,"
3583,PART III.,“Adorn’d with College-gown and Parish-hood;
3584,PART III.,"“Then, as he pac’d the hallow’d Aisles about,"
3585,PART III.,“He fill’d the sevenfold Surplice fairly out:
3586,PART III.,"“But in his Pulpit wearied down with Prayer,"
3587,PART III.,“He sat and seem’d as in his Study’s Chair;
3588,PART III.,"“For while the Anthem swell’d and when it ceas’d,"
3589,PART III.,“Th’ expecting People view’d their slumbering Priest;--
3590,PART III.,"“Who dozing, died.---- Our Parson _Peele_ was next;"
3591,PART III.,"“‘_I_ will not spare you,’ was his favourite Text:"
3592,PART III.,"“Nor did he spare, but rais’d them many a Pound;"
3593,PART III.,“Ev’n me he mulct for my poor Rood of Ground;
3594,PART III.,"“Yet car’d he nought, but with a gibing Speech,"
3595,PART III.,"“‘What should I do,’ quoth he, ‘but what _I_ preach?’"
3596,PART III.,“His piercing Jokes (and he’d a plenteous store)
3597,PART III.,“Were daily offer’d both to Rich and Poor;
3598,PART III.,"“His Scorn, his Love, in playful Words he spoke:"
3599,PART III.,"“His Pity, Praise, and Promise, were a Joke:"
3600,PART III.,"“But though so young and blest with spirits high,"
3601,PART III.,“He died as grave as any Judge could die:
3602,PART III.,"“The strong Attack subdu’d his lively Powers,--"
3603,PART III.,“His was the Grave and Doctor _Grandspear_ ours.”
3604,PART III.,“Then were there golden Times the Village round;
3605,PART III.,“In his Abundance all appear’d t’ abound;
3606,PART III.,"“Liberal and rich, a plenteous Board he spread,"
3607,PART III.,“Ev’n cool Dissenters at his Table fed;
3608,PART III.,"“Who wish’d,--and hop’d,--and thought a Man so kind,"
3609,PART III.,"“A Way to Heaven, though not their own, might find;"
3610,PART III.,"“To them, to all, he was polite and free,"
3611,PART III.,"“Kind to the Poor, and, ah! most kind to me:--"
3612,PART III.,"“‘_Ralph_,’ would he say, ‘_Ralph Dibble_, thou art old;"
3613,PART III.,"“‘That Doublet fit, ’twill keep thee from the Cold:"
3614,PART III.,“‘How does my Sexton?--What! the Times are hard;
3615,PART III.,“‘Drive that stout Pig and pen him in thy Yard.’

3620,PART III.,“Gay Days were these; but they were quickly past:

3624,PART III.,“Then came the _Author-Rector_; his Delight
3625,PART III.,"“Was all in Books; to read them, or to write:"
3626,PART III.,"“Women and Men, he strove alike to shun,"
3627,PART III.,"“And hurried homeward, when his Tasks were done;"
3628,PART III.,"“Courteous enough, but careless what he said,"
3629,PART III.,“For Points of Learning he reserv’d his Head;
3630,PART III.,"“And when addressing either Poor or Rich,"
3631,PART III.,“He knew no better than his Cassock which:
3632,PART III.,"“He, like an Osier, was of pliant kind,"
3633,PART III.,"“Erect by Nature, but to bend inclin’d;"
3634,PART III.,"“Not like a Creeper falling to the ground,"
3635,PART III.,“Or meanly catching on the Neighbours round;--
3636,PART III.,"“Careless was he of Surplice, Hood, and Band,--"
3637,PART III.,“And kindly took them as they came to hand;
3638,PART III.,"“Nor, like the Doctor, wore a World of Hat,"
3639,PART III.,“As if he sought for Dignity in that:
3640,PART III.,"“He talk’d, he gave, but not with cautious Rules:"
3641,PART III.,"“Nor turn’d from Gypsies, Vagabonds, or Fools;"
3642,PART III.,"“It was his Nature, but they thought it Whim,"
3643,PART III.,“And so our Beaux and Beauties turn’d from him:
3644,PART III.,"“Of Questions, much he wrote, profound and dark,--"
3645,PART III.,"“How spake the Serpent, and where stopp’d the Ark;"
3646,PART III.,“From what far Land the Queen of Sheba came;
3647,PART III.,“Who Salem’s Priest and what his Father’s Name;

3650,PART III.,"“He sleeps i’ the Aisle,--but not a Stone records"
3651,PART III.,"“His Name or Fame, his Actions or his Words:----"
3652,PART III.,"“And truth, your Reverence, when I look around,"
3653,PART III.,"“And mark the Tombs in our Sepulchral Ground,"

3656,PART III.,"“Next came a _Youth_ from _Cambridge_, and, in truth,"
3657,PART III.,“He was a sober and a comely Youth;
3658,PART III.,"“He blush’d in Meekness as a modest Man,"

4513,NEWSPAPER.,Hi narrata ferunt aliò; mensuráque ficti
4514,NEWSPAPER.,"Crescit, et auditis aliquid novus adjicit auctor:"
4515,NEWSPAPER.,"Illìc credulitas, illìc temerarius error,"
4516,NEWSPAPER.,"Vanáque lætitia est, consternatique timores,"
4517,NEWSPAPER.,"Seditióque repens, dubióque auctore susurri."

4520,NEWSPAPER.,
4521,NEWSPAPER.,"A time like this, a busy, bustling time,"
4522,NEWSPAPER.,"Suits ill with Writers, very ill with Rhyme;"
4523,NEWSPAPER.,"Unheard we sing when Party-rage runs strong,"
4524,NEWSPAPER.,And mightier Madness checks the flowing Song:
4525,NEWSPAPER.,Or should we force the peaceful Muse to wield
4526,NEWSPAPER.,Her feeble Arms amid the furious Field;
4527,NEWSPAPER.,"Where Party-Pens a wordy War maintain,"
4528,NEWSPAPER.,Poor is her Anger and her Friendship vain;
4529,NEWSPAPER.,"And oft the Foes who feel her Sting, combine,"
4530,NEWSPAPER.,Till serious Vengeance pays an idle Line;
4531,NEWSPAPER.,"For Party-Poets are like Wasps, who dart"
4532,NEWSPAPER.,Death to themselves and to their Foes but Smart.
4533,NEWSPAPER.,"Hard then our Fate: if general Themes we choose,"
4534,NEWSPAPER.,"Neglect awaits the Song, and chills the Muse;"
4535,NEWSPAPER.,"Or should we sing the Subject of the Day,"
4536,NEWSPAPER.,To-morrow’s Wonder puffs our Praise away.
4537,NEWSPAPER.,"More blest the Bards of that Poetic Time,"
4538,NEWSPAPER.,When all found Readers who could find a Rhyme;
4539,NEWSPAPER.,"Green grew the Bays on every teeming Head,"
4540,NEWSPAPER.,And _Cibber_ was enthron’d and _Settle_ read.
4541,NEWSPAPER.,"Sing, drooping Muse, the Cause of thy Decline;"
4542,NEWSPAPER.,Why reign no more the once-triumphant Nine?
4543,NEWSPAPER.,"Alas! new Charms the wavering Many gain,"
4544,NEWSPAPER.,And rival Sheets the Reader’s Eye detain;
4545,NEWSPAPER.,"A daily Swarm, that banish every Muse,"
4546,NEWSPAPER.,"Come flying forth, and Mortals call them NEWS:"
4547,NEWSPAPER.,"For these, unread the noblest Volumes lie;"
4548,NEWSPAPER.,"For these, in Sheets unsoil’d the Muses die;"
4549,NEWSPAPER.,"Unbought, unblest, the virgin Copies wait,"
4550,NEWSPAPER.,"In vain for Fame, and sink, unseen, to fate."
4551,NEWSPAPER.,"Since, then, the Town forsakes us for our Foes,"
4552,NEWSPAPER.,The smoothest Numbers for the harshest Prose;
4553,NEWSPAPER.,"Let us, with generous scorn, the Taste deride,"
4554,NEWSPAPER.,And sing our Rivals with a Rival’s Pride.
4555,NEWSPAPER.,"Ye gentle Poets, who so oft complain"
4556,NEWSPAPER.,That foul Neglect is all your Labours gain;
4557,NEWSPAPER.,That Pity only checks your growing Spite
4558,NEWSPAPER.,To erring Man and prompts you still to write;
4559,NEWSPAPER.,"That your choice Works on humble Stalls are laid,"
4560,NEWSPAPER.,Or vainly grace the Windows of the Trade;
4561,NEWSPAPER.,"Be ye my Friends, if Friendship e’er can warm"
4562,NEWSPAPER.,Those rival Bosoms whom the Muses charm:
4563,NEWSPAPER.,"Think of the common Cause, wherein we go,"
4564,NEWSPAPER.,Like gallant Greeks against the Trojan foe;
4565,NEWSPAPER.,"Nor let one peevish Chief his Leader blame,"
4566,NEWSPAPER.,Till crown’d with Conquest we regain our Fame;
4567,NEWSPAPER.,And let us join our Forces to subdue
4568,NEWSPAPER.,This bold assuming but successful Crew.
4569,NEWSPAPER.,
4570,NEWSPAPER.,"I sing of NEWS, and all those vapid Sheets"
4571,NEWSPAPER.,The rattling Hawker vends thro’ gaping Streets;
4572,NEWSPAPER.,"Whate’er their Name, whate’er the Time they fly,"
4573,NEWSPAPER.,"Damp from the Press, to charm the Reader’s Eye:"
4574,NEWSPAPER.,"For, soon as Morning dawns with roseate hue,"
4575,NEWSPAPER.,The HERALD of the Morn arises too;
4576,NEWSPAPER.,"POST after POST succeeds, and all day long,"
4577,NEWSPAPER.,"GAZETTES and LEDGERS swarm, a noisy throng."
4578,NEWSPAPER.,"When Evening comes, she comes with all her train"
4579,NEWSPAPER.,"Of LEDGERS, CHRONICLES, and POSTS again,"
4580,NEWSPAPER.,"Like Bats appearing when the Sun goes down,"
4581,NEWSPAPER.,From Holes obscure and Corners of the Town.
4582,NEWSPAPER.,"Of all these Triflers, all like these, I write;"
4583,NEWSPAPER.,"Oh! like my Subject could my Song delight,"
4584,NEWSPAPER.,"The Crowd at _Lloyd_’s one Poet’s Name should raise,"
4585,NEWSPAPER.,And all the _Alley_ echo to his praise.
4586,NEWSPAPER.,"In shoals the Hours their constant Numbers bring,"
4587,NEWSPAPER.,Like Insects waking to th’ advancing Spring;
4588,NEWSPAPER.,"Which take their rise from Grubs obscene that lie,"
4589,NEWSPAPER.,"In shallow Pools, or thence ascend the Sky;"
4590,NEWSPAPER.,"Such are these base Ephemeras, so born"
4591,NEWSPAPER.,To die before the next revolving Morn.
4592,NEWSPAPER.,Yet thus they differ: Insect-tribes are lost
4593,NEWSPAPER.,In the first Visit of a Winter’s Frost;
4594,NEWSPAPER.,"While these remain, a base but constant Breed,"
4595,NEWSPAPER.,Whose swarming Sons their short-liv’d Sires succeed;
4596,NEWSPAPER.,"No changing Season makes their Number less,"
4597,NEWSPAPER.,Nor Sunday shines a Sabbath on the Press!!
4598,NEWSPAPER.,
4599,NEWSPAPER.,"Then lo! the sainted MONITOR is born,"
4600,NEWSPAPER.,Whose pious Face some sacred Texts adorn:
4601,NEWSPAPER.,"As artful Sinners cloak the secret Sin,"
4602,NEWSPAPER.,To veil with seeming Grace the Guile within;
4603,NEWSPAPER.,"So Moral Essays on his Front appear,"
4604,NEWSPAPER.,But all is Carnal Business in the Rear;
4605,NEWSPAPER.,"The fresh-coin’d Lie, the Secret whisper’d last,"
4606,NEWSPAPER.,And all the Gleanings of the six Days past.
4607,NEWSPAPER.,"With these retir’d, thro’ half the Sabbath-day,"
4608,NEWSPAPER.,The London-lounger yawns his Hours away:
4609,NEWSPAPER.,"Not so, my little Flock!, your Preacher fly,"
4610,NEWSPAPER.,Nor waste the Time no worldly Wealth can buy;
4611,NEWSPAPER.,"But let the decent Maid and sober Clown,"
4612,NEWSPAPER.,Pray for these Idlers of the sinful Town:
4613,NEWSPAPER.,"This Day at least, on nobler Themes bestow,"
4614,NEWSPAPER.,"Nor give to _Woodfall_, or the World below."
4615,NEWSPAPER.,
4616,NEWSPAPER.,"But, Sunday past, what Numbers flourish then,"
4617,NEWSPAPER.,What wond’rous Labours of the Press and Pen!
4618,NEWSPAPER.,"Diurnal most, some thrice each Week affords,"
4619,NEWSPAPER.,"Some only once, O Avarice of Words!"
4620,NEWSPAPER.,"When thousand starving Minds such Manna seek[12],"
4621,NEWSPAPER.,To drop the precious Food but once a Week.
4622,NEWSPAPER.,"Endless it were to sing the Powers of all,"
4623,NEWSPAPER.,"Their Names, their Numbers; how they rise and fall;"
4624,NEWSPAPER.,"Like baneful Herbs the Gazer’s eye they seize,"
4625,NEWSPAPER.,Rush to the head and poison where they please;
4626,NEWSPAPER.,"Like idle Flies, a busy, buzzing train,"
4627,NEWSPAPER.,They drop their Maggots in the Trifler’s Brain:
4628,NEWSPAPER.,"That genial Soil receives the fruitful Store,"
4629,NEWSPAPER.,"And there they grow, and breed a thousand more."
4630,NEWSPAPER.,
4631,NEWSPAPER.,"Now be their Arts display’d, how first they choose"
4632,NEWSPAPER.,"A Cause and Party, as the Bard his Muse;"
4633,NEWSPAPER.,"Inspir’d by these, with clamorous zeal they cry,"
4634,NEWSPAPER.,And thro’ the Town their Dreams and Omens fly:
4635,NEWSPAPER.,"So the Sibylline[13] Leaves were blown about,"
4636,NEWSPAPER.,Disjointed scraps of Fate involv’d in doubt:
4637,NEWSPAPER.,"So idle Dreams, the Journals of the Night,"
4638,NEWSPAPER.,"Are right and wrong by turns, and mingle Wrong with Right."
4639,NEWSPAPER.,"Some Champions for the Rights that prop the Crown,"
4640,NEWSPAPER.,"Some sturdy Patriots, sworn to pull them down;"
4641,NEWSPAPER.,"Some neutral Powers, with secret Forces fraught,"
4642,NEWSPAPER.,"Wishing for War, but willing to be bought;"
4643,NEWSPAPER.,"While some to every Side and Party go,"
4644,NEWSPAPER.,Shift every Friend and join with every Foe;
4645,NEWSPAPER.,Like sturdy Rogues in Privateers they strike
4646,NEWSPAPER.,"This side and that, the Foes of both alike;"
4647,NEWSPAPER.,"A Traitor-crew, who thrive in troubled Times,"
4648,NEWSPAPER.,Fear’d for their Force and courted for their Crimes.
4649,NEWSPAPER.,"Chief to the prosperous side the Numbers sail,"
4650,NEWSPAPER.,"Fickle and false, they veer with every Gale;"
4651,NEWSPAPER.,"As Birds that migrate from a freezing Shore,"
4652,NEWSPAPER.,"In search of warmer Climes, come skimming o’er,"
4653,NEWSPAPER.,Some bold Adventurers first prepare to try
4654,NEWSPAPER.,The doubtful Sunshine of the distant Sky;
4655,NEWSPAPER.,But soon the growing Summer’s certain Sun
4656,NEWSPAPER.,"Wins more and more, till all at last are won;"
4657,NEWSPAPER.,"So, on the early Prospect of Disgrace,"
4658,NEWSPAPER.,Fly in vast Troops this apprehensive Race;
4659,NEWSPAPER.,"Instinctive Tribes! their failing Food they dread,"
4660,NEWSPAPER.,"And buy, with timely Change, their future Bread."
4661,NEWSPAPER.,
4662,NEWSPAPER.,"Such are our Guides; how many a peaceful Head,"
4663,NEWSPAPER.,"Born to be still, have they to wrangling led!"
4664,NEWSPAPER.,"How many an honest Zealot, stol’n from Trade,"
4665,NEWSPAPER.,And factious Tools of pious Pastors made!
4666,NEWSPAPER.,"With Clews like these they tread the Maze of State,"
4667,NEWSPAPER.,"These Oracles explore, to learn our Fate;"
4668,NEWSPAPER.,"Pleas’d with the Guides who can so well deceive,"
4669,NEWSPAPER.,Who cannot lie so fast as they believe.
4670,NEWSPAPER.,
4671,NEWSPAPER.,"Oft lend I, loth, to some sage Friend an ear,"
4672,NEWSPAPER.,(For we who will not speak are doom’d to hear);
4673,NEWSPAPER.,"While he, bewilder’d tells his anxious Thought,"
4674,NEWSPAPER.,"Infectious Fear from tainted Scribblers caught,"
4675,NEWSPAPER.,"Or idiot Hope; for each his Mind assails,"
4676,NEWSPAPER.,As LLOYD’s Court-light or STOCKDALE’s Gloom prevails.
4677,NEWSPAPER.,"Yet stand I patient while but one declaims,"
4678,NEWSPAPER.,Or gives dull Comments on the Speech he maims;
4679,NEWSPAPER.,"But oh! ye Muses, keep your Votary’s feet"
4680,NEWSPAPER.,From Tavern-haunts where Politicians meet;
4681,NEWSPAPER.,"Where Rector, Doctor, and Attorney pause,"
4682,NEWSPAPER.,First on each Parish then each public Cause:
4683,NEWSPAPER.,Indited Roads and Rates that still increase;
4684,NEWSPAPER.,"The murmuring Poor, who will not fast in peace;"
4685,NEWSPAPER.,"Election-zeal and Friendship, since declin’d;"
4686,NEWSPAPER.,"A Tax commuted, or a Tithe in Kind;"
4687,NEWSPAPER.,"The Dutch and Germans kindling into strife,"
4688,NEWSPAPER.,Dull Port and Poachers vile! the serious Ills of Life.
4689,NEWSPAPER.,"Here comes the neighbouring Justice, pleas’d to guide"
4690,NEWSPAPER.,His little Club and in the Chair preside.
4691,NEWSPAPER.,"In private Business his Commands prevail,"
4692,NEWSPAPER.,On public Themes his Reasoning turns the scale;
4693,NEWSPAPER.,"Assenting Silence soothes his happy Ear,"
4694,NEWSPAPER.,"And, in or out, his Party triumphs here."
4695,NEWSPAPER.,
4696,NEWSPAPER.,"Nor here th’ infectious rage for Party stops,"
4697,NEWSPAPER.,But flits along from Palaces to Shops;
4698,NEWSPAPER.,"Our weekly Journals o’er the Land abound,"
4699,NEWSPAPER.,And spread their Plagues and Influenzas round;
4700,NEWSPAPER.,"The Village too, the peaceful, pleasant Plain,"
4701,NEWSPAPER.,Breeds the Whig-farmer and the Tory-swain;
4702,NEWSPAPER.,"Brooks’ and St. Alban’s boasts not, but instead,"
4703,NEWSPAPER.,"Stares the Red Ram, and swings the _Rodney_’s Head:--"
4704,NEWSPAPER.,"Hither, with all a Patriot’s care, comes he"
4705,NEWSPAPER.,Who owns the little Hut that makes him free;
4706,NEWSPAPER.,Whose yearly Forty Shillings buy the Smile
4707,NEWSPAPER.,"Of mightier Men, and never waste the while;"
4708,NEWSPAPER.,"Who feels his Freehold’s Worth and looks elate,"
4709,NEWSPAPER.,A little Prop and Pillar of the State.
4710,NEWSPAPER.,"Here he delights the weekly News to con,"
4711,NEWSPAPER.,And mingle Comments as he blunders on;
4712,NEWSPAPER.,"To swallow all their varying Authors teach,"
4713,NEWSPAPER.,To spell a Title and confound a Speech:
4714,NEWSPAPER.,"Till with a muddled Mind he quits the News,"
4715,NEWSPAPER.,And claims his Nation’s Licence to abuse;
4716,NEWSPAPER.,"Then joins the Cry, “That all the Courtly Race,"
4717,NEWSPAPER.,“Are venal Candidates for Power and Place;”
4718,NEWSPAPER.,"Yet feels some joy amid the general Vice,"
4719,NEWSPAPER.,That his own Vote will bring its wonted Price.
4720,NEWSPAPER.,"These are the Ills the teeming Press supplies,"
4721,NEWSPAPER.,These pois’nous Springs from Learning’s Fountain rise;
4722,NEWSPAPER.,"Not there the Wise alone their Entrance find,"
4723,NEWSPAPER.,Imparting useful Light to Mortals blind;
4724,NEWSPAPER.,"But, blind themselves, these erring Guides hold out"
4725,NEWSPAPER.,"Alluring Lights, to lead us far about;"
4726,NEWSPAPER.,"Screen’d by such Means, here Scandal whets her Quill,"
4727,NEWSPAPER.,"Here Slander shoots unseen, whene’er she will;"
4728,NEWSPAPER.,"Here Fraud and Falsehood labour to deceive,"
4729,NEWSPAPER.,"And Folly aids them both, impatient to believe."
4730,NEWSPAPER.,
4731,NEWSPAPER.,"Such, Sons of BRITAIN!, are the Guides ye trust;"
4732,NEWSPAPER.,"So wise their Counsel, their Reports so just:--"
4733,NEWSPAPER.,"Yet, though we cannot call their Morals pure,"
4734,NEWSPAPER.,"Their Judgment nice, or their Decisions sure;"
4735,NEWSPAPER.,"Merit they have to mightier Works unknown,"
4736,NEWSPAPER.,"A Style, a Manner, and a Fate their own."
4737,NEWSPAPER.,"We, who for longer Fame with labour strive,"
4738,NEWSPAPER.,Are pain’d to keep our sickly Works alive;
4739,NEWSPAPER.,"Studious we toil, with patient Care refine,"
4740,NEWSPAPER.,Nor let our Love protect one languid Line.
4741,NEWSPAPER.,"Severe ourselves, at last our Works appear,"
4742,NEWSPAPER.,"When, ah! we find our Readers more severe;"
4743,NEWSPAPER.,"For after all our Care and Pains, how few"
4744,NEWSPAPER.,"Acquire Applause, or keep it if they do!--"
4745,NEWSPAPER.,"Not so these Sheets, ordain’d to happier fate,"
4746,NEWSPAPER.,"Prais’d thro’ their Day, and but that Day their Date;"
4747,NEWSPAPER.,Their careless Authors only strive to join
4748,NEWSPAPER.,"As many Words, as make an even Line[14];"
4749,NEWSPAPER.,"As many Lines, as fill a Row complete;"
4750,NEWSPAPER.,"As many Rows, as furnish up a Sheet:"
4751,NEWSPAPER.,"From side to side, with ready Types they run,"
4752,NEWSPAPER.,"The Measure’s ended, and the Work is done;"
4753,NEWSPAPER.,"Oh, born with Ease, how envy’d and how blest!"
4754,NEWSPAPER.,Your Fate to-day and your to-morrow’s Rest.
4755,NEWSPAPER.,"To you all Readers turn, and they can look"
4756,NEWSPAPER.,"Pleas’d on a Paper, who abhor a Book;"
4757,NEWSPAPER.,"Those who ne’er deign’d their Bible to peruse,"
4758,NEWSPAPER.,Would think it hard to be deny’d their News;
4759,NEWSPAPER.,"Sinners and Saints, the wisest with the weak,"
4760,NEWSPAPER.,Here mingle Tastes and one Amusement seek:
4761,NEWSPAPER.,"This, like the Public Inn, provides a Treat,"
4762,NEWSPAPER.,Where each promiscuous Guest sits down to eat;
4763,NEWSPAPER.,"And such this mental Food, as we may call,"
4764,NEWSPAPER.,Something to all Men and to some Men all.
4765,NEWSPAPER.,
4766,NEWSPAPER.,"Next, in what rare Production shall we trace,"
4767,NEWSPAPER.,Such various Subjects in so small a Space?
4768,NEWSPAPER.,As the first Ship upon the Waters bore
4769,NEWSPAPER.,Incongruous Kinds who never met before;
4770,NEWSPAPER.,"Or as some curious Virtuoso joins,"
4771,NEWSPAPER.,"In one small room, Moths, Minerals, and Coins,"
4772,NEWSPAPER.,"Birds, Beasts, and Fishes; nor refuses place"
4773,NEWSPAPER.,"To Serpents, Toads, and all the Reptile-race;"
4774,NEWSPAPER.,"So here, compress’d within a single Sheet,"
4775,NEWSPAPER.,"Great things and small, the mean and mighty meet;"
4776,NEWSPAPER.,"’Tis this which makes all Europe’s Business known,"
4777,NEWSPAPER.,Yet here a private Man may place his own;
4778,NEWSPAPER.,"And where he reads of Lords and Commons, he"
4779,NEWSPAPER.,May tell their Honours that he sells Rappee.
4780,NEWSPAPER.,Add next th’ Amusement which the motley Page
4781,NEWSPAPER.,Affords to either Sex and every Age:
4782,NEWSPAPER.,"Lo! where it comes before the cheerful Fire,"
4783,NEWSPAPER.,"Damps from the Press in smoky Curls aspire,"
4784,NEWSPAPER.,"(As from the Earth the Sun exhales the Dew,)"
4785,NEWSPAPER.,Ere we can read the Wonders that ensue:
4786,NEWSPAPER.,"Then eager every Eye surveys the Part,"
4787,NEWSPAPER.,That brings its favourite Subject to the Heart;
4788,NEWSPAPER.,"Grave Politicians look for Facts alone,"
4789,NEWSPAPER.,And gravely add Conjectures of their own:
4790,NEWSPAPER.,"The sprightly Nymph, who never broke her rest"
4791,NEWSPAPER.,"For tottering Crowns, or mighty Lands opprest,"
4792,NEWSPAPER.,"Finds Broils and Battles, but neglects them all"
4793,NEWSPAPER.,"For Songs and Suits, a Birth-day, or a Ball:"
4794,NEWSPAPER.,The keen warm Man o’erlooks each idle Tale
4795,NEWSPAPER.,"For “Moneys wanted,” and “Estates on Sale;”"
4796,NEWSPAPER.,"While some with equal Minds to all attend,"
4797,NEWSPAPER.,Pleas’d with each Part and griev’d to find an End.
4798,NEWSPAPER.,
4799,NEWSPAPER.,"So charm the News; but we, who, far from Town,"
4800,NEWSPAPER.,"Wait till the Post-man brings the Packet down,"
4801,NEWSPAPER.,"Once in the Week, a vacant Day behold,"
4802,NEWSPAPER.,"And stay for Tidings, till they’re three Days old:"
4803,NEWSPAPER.,"That Day arrives; no welcome Post appears,"
4804,NEWSPAPER.,But the dull Morn a sullen Aspect wears;
4805,NEWSPAPER.,"We meet, but ah! without our wonted Smile,"
4806,NEWSPAPER.,"To talk of Headaches, and complain of Bile;"
4807,NEWSPAPER.,"Sullen we ponder o’er a dull Repast,"
4808,NEWSPAPER.,Nor feast the Body while the Mind must fast.
4809,NEWSPAPER.,"A master Passion is the Love of News,"
4810,NEWSPAPER.,"Not Music so commands, nor so the Muse;"
4811,NEWSPAPER.,"Give Poets Claret, they grow idle soon;"
4812,NEWSPAPER.,Feed the Musician and he’s out of tune;
4813,NEWSPAPER.,"But the sick Mind of this Disease possest,"
4814,NEWSPAPER.,Flies from all Cure and sickens when at rest.
4815,NEWSPAPER.,
4816,NEWSPAPER.,"Now sing, my Muse, what various Parts compose"
4817,NEWSPAPER.,These rival Sheets of Politicks and Prose.
4818,NEWSPAPER.,"First, from each Brother’s Hoard a Part they draw,"
4819,NEWSPAPER.,A mutual Theft that never fear’d a Law;
4820,NEWSPAPER.,"Whate’er they gain, to each man’s Portion fall,"
4821,NEWSPAPER.,"And read it once, you read it through them all:"
4822,NEWSPAPER.,"For this their Runners ramble day and night,"
4823,NEWSPAPER.,To drag each lurking Deed to open Light;
4824,NEWSPAPER.,"For daily Bread the dirty Trade they ply,"
4825,NEWSPAPER.,Coin their fresh Tales and live upon the Lie:
4826,NEWSPAPER.,"Like Bees for Honey, forth for News they spring,"
4827,NEWSPAPER.,Industrious Creatures! ever on the Wing;
4828,NEWSPAPER.,"Home to their several Cells they bear the Store,"
4829,NEWSPAPER.,"Cull’d of all Kinds, then roam abroad for more."
4830,NEWSPAPER.,No anxious Virgin flies to “fair Tweed-side;”
4831,NEWSPAPER.,No injur’d Husband mourns his faithless Bride;
4832,NEWSPAPER.,No Duel dooms the fiery Youth to bleed;
4833,NEWSPAPER.,But thro’ the Town transpires each vent’rous Deed.
4834,NEWSPAPER.,
4835,NEWSPAPER.,"Should some fair Frail-one drive her prancing Pair,"
4836,NEWSPAPER.,Where rival Peers contend to please the Fair;
4837,NEWSPAPER.,"When with new force, she aids her conquering Eyes,"
4838,NEWSPAPER.,"And Beauty decks, with all that Beauty buys;"
4839,NEWSPAPER.,"Quickly we learn whose Heart her Influence feels,"
4840,NEWSPAPER.,"Whose Acres melt, before her glowing Wheels."
4841,NEWSPAPER.,"To these a thousand idle Themes succeed,"
4842,NEWSPAPER.,Deeds of all kinds and Comments to each Deed.
4843,NEWSPAPER.,"Here Stocks, the State-Barometers we view,"
4844,NEWSPAPER.,"That rise or fall, by Causes known to few;"
4845,NEWSPAPER.,"Promotion’s Ladder who goes up or down,"
4846,NEWSPAPER.,"Who wed, or who seduc’d, amuse the Town;"
4847,NEWSPAPER.,"What new’-born Heir has made his Father blest,"
4848,NEWSPAPER.,"What Heir exults, his Father now at rest;"
4849,NEWSPAPER.,"That ample List the Tyburn-herald gives,"
4850,NEWSPAPER.,"And each known Knave, who still for Tyburn lives."
4851,NEWSPAPER.,
4852,NEWSPAPER.,"So grows the Work, and now the Printer tries"
4853,NEWSPAPER.,"His Powers no more, but leans on his Allies."
4854,NEWSPAPER.,
4855,NEWSPAPER.,"When lo! the advertising Tribe succeed,"
4856,NEWSPAPER.,"Pay to be read, yet find but few will read;"
4857,NEWSPAPER.,"And chief th’ illustrious Race, whose Drops and Pills"
4858,NEWSPAPER.,Have patent Powers to vanquish human Ills:
4859,NEWSPAPER.,"These, with their Cures, a constant Aid remain,"
4860,NEWSPAPER.,To bless the pale Composer’s fertile Brain:
4861,NEWSPAPER.,"Fertile it is, but still the noblest Soil"
4862,NEWSPAPER.,"Requires some pause, some intervals from Toil;"
4863,NEWSPAPER.,And they at least a certain Ease obtain
4864,NEWSPAPER.,"From _Katterfelto_’s Skill, and _Graham_’s glowing Strain."
4865,NEWSPAPER.,
4866,NEWSPAPER.,"I too must aid, and pay to see my Name"

4915,NEWSPAPER.,Not Nature’s self so natural as these.”
4916,NEWSPAPER.,"Such are their Arts, but not confin’d to them,"
4917,NEWSPAPER.,The Muse impartial must her Sons condemn:
4918,NEWSPAPER.,"For they, degenerate! join the venal Throng,"
4919,NEWSPAPER.,And puff a lazy Pegasus along:

4929,NEWSPAPER.,A puffing Poet to his Honour blind;
4930,NEWSPAPER.,Who silly drops Quotations all about

4932,NEWSPAPER.,"Who advertises what Reviewers say,"
4933,NEWSPAPER.,With sham Editions every second day;

4935,NEWSPAPER.,But hurries into Fame with all his might;
4936,NEWSPAPER.,"Although the Verse some transient Praise obtains,"
4937,NEWSPAPER.,Contempt is all the anxious Poet gains.
4938,NEWSPAPER.,"Now Puffs exhausted, Advertisements past,"
4939,NEWSPAPER.,Their Correspondents stand expos’d at last:
4940,NEWSPAPER.,"These are a numerous Tribe to Fame unknown,"
4941,NEWSPAPER.,Who for the public Good forego their own;
4942,NEWSPAPER.,"Who Volunteers in Paper-war engage,"
4943,NEWSPAPER.,With double Portion of their Party’s Rage:

4948,NEWSPAPER.,
4949,NEWSPAPER.,Oh! cruel WOODFALL! when a Patriot draws
4950,NEWSPAPER.,"His grey-goose Quill in his dear Country’s Cause,"
4951,NEWSPAPER.,"To vex and maul a Ministerial Race,"
4952,NEWSPAPER.,Can thy stern Soul refuse the Champion place?

4959,NEWSPAPER.,
4960,NEWSPAPER.,"These Roman Souls, like Rome’s great Sons, are known"

5098,SWIFT.,"Look’d to the Pittance, that repay’d his Toil;"
5099,SWIFT.,"And to a Master left the mingled Joy,"

5105,SWIFT.,
5106,SWIFT.,"In that same Plain a Nymph of curious Taste,"

5114,SWIFT.,"’Twas all her Pride, new Traps for Praise to lay,"
5115,SWIFT.,And all her Wisdom was to hide her Way;
5116,SWIFT.,"In small Attempts incessant were her Pains,"

5118,SWIFT.,
5119,SWIFT.,"Now, whether Fate decreed this Pair should wed,"

5127,SWIFT.,"Their Ways were diverse, varying was their Will,"
5128,SWIFT.,"Nor long the Maid had blest the simple Man,"
5129,SWIFT.,Before Dissentions rose and she began:--
5130,SWIFT.,
5131,SWIFT.,"“Wretch that I am! since to thy Fortune bound,"
5132,SWIFT.,"“What plan, what project with success is crown’d?"

5163,SWIFT.,Permits harsh Truth his Errors to disprove:

5172,SWIFT.,
5173,SWIFT.,"Time fled, and now the Swain compell’d to see"
5174,SWIFT.,New Cause for Fear--‘Is this thy Thrift?’ quoth he.
5175,SWIFT.,To whom the Wife with cheerful voice replied:--
5176,SWIFT.,"“Thou moody Man, lay all thy Fears aside,"
5177,SWIFT.,"“I’ve seen a Vision;--they from whom I came,"
5178,SWIFT.,"“A Daughter promise, promise Wealth and Fame;"

5186,SWIFT.,
5187,SWIFT.,"This heard the Husband and in surly smile,"
5188,SWIFT.,"Aim’d at Contempt, but yet he hop’d the while;"
5189,SWIFT.,"For as when sinking, wretched Men are found,"
5190,SWIFT.,To catch at Rushes rather than be drown’d;
5191,SWIFT.,"So on a Dream our Peasant plac’d his Hope,"
5192,SWIFT.,And found that Rush as valid as a Rope.
5193,SWIFT.,
5194,SWIFT.,"Swift fled the Days, for now in Hope they fled;"
5195,SWIFT.,When a fair Daughter bless’d the Nuptial Bed;
5196,SWIFT.,"Her Infant-face the Mother’s Pains beguil’d,"
5197,SWIFT.,She look’d so pleasing and so softly smil’d;
5198,SWIFT.,"Those Smiles, those Looks, with sweet Sensations mov’d"
5199,SWIFT.,"The Gazer’s Soul, and as he look’d, he lov’d."
5200,SWIFT.,
5201,SWIFT.,"And now the Fairies came with Gifts to grace,"
5202,SWIFT.,So mild a Nature and so fair a Face.
5203,SWIFT.,"They gave, with Beauty, that bewitching Art,"
5204,SWIFT.,That holds in easy Chains the human Heart;
5205,SWIFT.,"They gave her Skill to win the stubborn Mind,"
5206,SWIFT.,"To make the Suffering to their Sorrows blind,"
5207,SWIFT.,"To bring on pensive Looks the pleasing Smile,"
5208,SWIFT.,And Care’s stern Brow of every Frown beguile.
5209,SWIFT.,"These magic Favours grac’d the Infant-maid,"
5210,SWIFT.,"Whose more enlivening Smile, the charming Gifts repaid."
5211,SWIFT.,
5212,SWIFT.,"Now Fortune chang’d, who, were she constant long,"
5213,SWIFT.,Would leave us few Adventures for our Song.
5214,SWIFT.,"A wicked Elfin rov’d this Land around,"
5215,SWIFT.,Whose Joys proceeded from the Griefs he found;
5216,SWIFT.,"_Envy_ his Name:--his fascinating Eye,"
5217,SWIFT.,From the light Bosom drew the sudden Sigh;
5218,SWIFT.,"Unsocial he, but with malignant Mind,"
5219,SWIFT.,"He dwelt with Man, that he might curse Mankind;"
5220,SWIFT.,"Like the first Foe he sought th’ Abode of Joy,"
5221,SWIFT.,Griev’d to behold but eager to destroy;
5222,SWIFT.,"Round blooming Beauty, like the Wasp, he flew,"
5223,SWIFT.,Soil’d the fresh Sweet and chang’d the rosy Hue;
5224,SWIFT.,"The Wise, the Good, with anxious Heart, he saw,"
5225,SWIFT.,And here a Failing found and there a Flaw;
5226,SWIFT.,"Discord in Families ’twas his to move,"
5227,SWIFT.,"Distrust in Friendship, Jealousy in Love;"
5228,SWIFT.,"He told the Poor, what Joys the Great possess’d,"
5229,SWIFT.,The Great--what calm Content the Cottage bless’d;
5230,SWIFT.,"To part the Learned and the Rich he tried,"
5231,SWIFT.,Till their slow Friendship perish’d in their Pride.
5232,SWIFT.,"Such was the Fiend, and so secure of Prey,"
5233,SWIFT.,That only Misery pass’d unstung away.
5234,SWIFT.,
5235,SWIFT.,"Soon as he heard the Fairy-babe was born,"
5236,SWIFT.,"Scornful he smil’d, but felt no more than Scorn;"
5237,SWIFT.,"For why, when Fortune plac’d her State so low,"
5238,SWIFT.,In useless Spite his lofty Malice show?
5239,SWIFT.,"Why in a Mischief of the meaner Kind,"
5240,SWIFT.,Exhaust the Vigour of a rancorous Mind?
5241,SWIFT.,"But soon as Fame the Fairy-gifts proclaim’d,"
5242,SWIFT.,Quick-rising Wrath his ready Soul inflam’d;
5243,SWIFT.,"To swear by Vows, that ev’n the Wicked tie,"
5244,SWIFT.,The Nymph should weep her varied Destiny;
5245,SWIFT.,"That every Gift, that now appear’d to shine"
5246,SWIFT.,"In her fair Face and make her Smiles divine,"

5699,PATIENT.,
5700,PATIENT.,My Lady!--she was all we love;

5758,PATIENT.,"I sat, when these curs’d Tidings came;"
5759,PATIENT.,"Their Guilt, their Flight was told aloud,"
5760,PATIENT.,And Envy smil’d to hear my shame!
5761,PATIENT.,
5762,PATIENT.,I call’d on Vengeance; at the Word
5763,PATIENT.,She came:--Can I the Deed forget?
5764,PATIENT.,"I held the Sword, th’ accursed Sword,"
5765,PATIENT.,The Blood of his false Heart made wet;
5766,PATIENT.,"And that fair Victim paid her Debt,"

5769,PATIENT.,Fair fallen Thing! my Rage forgive!
5770,PATIENT.,
5771,PATIENT.,"Those Cherubs still, my Life to bless,"
5772,PATIENT.,"Were left; could I my Fears remove,"
5773,PATIENT.,"Sad Fears that check’d each fond Caress,"

5782,PATIENT.,"The dire Infection came:--They died,"
5783,PATIENT.,And I was curs’d--as I am now----
5784,PATIENT.,"Nay frown not, angry Friend,--allow,"
5785,PATIENT.,"That I was deeply, sorely tried;"
5786,PATIENT.,"Hear then, and you must wonder how"
5787,PATIENT.,I could such Storms and Strifes abide.
5788,PATIENT.,
5789,PATIENT.,"Storms!--not that Clouds embattled make,"
5790,PATIENT.,When they afflict this earthly Globe;
5791,PATIENT.,But such as with their Terrors shake
5792,PATIENT.,"Man’s Breast, and to the bottom probe;"
5793,PATIENT.,"They make the Hypocrite disrobe,"
5794,PATIENT.,"They try us all, if false or true;"
5795,PATIENT.,"For this, one Devil had pow’r on _Job_;"
5796,PATIENT.,And I was long the Slave of two.

5798,PHYSICIAN.,PHYSICIAN.
5799,PHYSICIAN.,
5800,PHYSICIAN.,"Peace, peace, my Friend; these Subjects fly;"

5803,PATIENT.,PATIENT.
5804,PATIENT.,
5805,PATIENT.,And shall I then the Fact deny?
5806,PATIENT.,"I was,--thou know’st,--I was begone,"
5807,PATIENT.,"Like him who fill’d the Eastern Throne,"
5808,PATIENT.,To whom the WATCHER cried aloud[16];
5809,PATIENT.,"That royal Wretch of _Babylon_,"
5810,PATIENT.,Who was so guilty and so proud.
5811,PATIENT.,
5812,PATIENT.,"Like him with haughty, stubborn Mind,"
5813,PATIENT.,"I, in my State, my Comforts sought;"
5814,PATIENT.,"Delight and Praise I hop’d to find,"
5815,PATIENT.,"In what I builded, planted, bought!"
5816,PATIENT.,Oh! Arrogance! by Misery taught--
5817,PATIENT.,Soon came a Voice! I felt it come;
5818,PATIENT.,"“Full be his Cup, with Evil fraught,"
5819,PATIENT.,"“Dæmons his Guides, and Death his Doom!”"
5820,PATIENT.,
5821,PATIENT.,Then was I cast from out my State;
5822,PATIENT.,Two Fiends of Darkness led my Way;
5823,PATIENT.,"They wak’d me early, watch’d me late,"
5824,PATIENT.,"My Dread by Night, my Plague by Day!"
5825,PATIENT.,"Oh! I was made their Sport, their Play,"
5826,PATIENT.,"Through many a stormy troubled Year,"
5827,PATIENT.,"And how they us’d their passive Prey,"
5828,PATIENT.,Is sad to tell: but you shall hear.
5829,PATIENT.,
5830,PATIENT.,"And first, before they sent me forth,"
5831,PATIENT.,"Through this unpitying World to run,"
5832,PATIENT.,"They robb’d _Sir Eustace_ of his Worth,"
5833,PATIENT.,"Lands, Manors, Lordships, every one;"
5834,PATIENT.,"So was that gracious Man undone,"
5835,PATIENT.,"Was spurn’d as vile, was scorn’d as poor,"
5836,PATIENT.,"Whom every former Friend would shun,"
5837,PATIENT.,And Menials drove from every Door.
5838,PATIENT.,
5839,PATIENT.,"Then those ill-favour’d Ones[17], whom none"
5840,PATIENT.,"But my unhappy Eyes could view,"
5841,PATIENT.,"Led me, with wild Emotion on,"
5842,PATIENT.,"And, with resistless Terror, drew."
5843,PATIENT.,"Through Lands we fled, o’er Seas we flew,"
5844,PATIENT.,And halted on a boundless Plain;
5845,PATIENT.,"Where nothing fed, nor breath’d nor grew,"
5846,PATIENT.,But Silence rul’d the still Domain.
5847,PATIENT.,
5848,PATIENT.,"Upon that boundless Plain, below,"
5849,PATIENT.,"The setting Sun’s last Rays were shed,"
5850,PATIENT.,"And gave a mild and sober Glow,"
5851,PATIENT.,"Where all were still, asleep or dead;"
5852,PATIENT.,"Vast Ruins in the midst were spread,"
5853,PATIENT.,"Pillars and Pediments sublime,"
5854,PATIENT.,"Where the grey Moss had form’d a Bed,"
5855,PATIENT.,And cloth’d the crumbling Spoils of Time.
5856,PATIENT.,
5857,PATIENT.,"There was I fix’d, I know not how,"
5858,PATIENT.,Condemn’d for untold Years to stay;
5859,PATIENT.,"Yet Years were not;--one dreadful _Now_,"
5860,PATIENT.,Endur’d no Change of Night or Day;
5861,PATIENT.,"The same mild Evening’s sleeping Ray,"
5862,PATIENT.,Shone softly-solemn and serene.
5863,PATIENT.,"And all that time, I gaz’d away,"
5864,PATIENT.,The setting Sun’s sad Rays were seen.
5865,PATIENT.,
5866,PATIENT.,"At length a Moment’s Sleep stole on,--"
5867,PATIENT.,Again came my commission’d Foes;
5868,PATIENT.,"Again through Sea and Land we’re gone,"
5869,PATIENT.,"No Peace, no Respite, no Repose;"
5870,PATIENT.,"Above the dark broad Sea we rose,"
5871,PATIENT.,We ran through bleak and frozen Land;
5872,PATIENT.,"I had no Strength, their Strength t’ oppose,"
5873,PATIENT.,An Infant in a Giant’s hand.
5874,PATIENT.,
5875,PATIENT.,"They plac’d me where those Streamers play,"
5876,PATIENT.,Those nimble Beams of brilliant Light;
5877,PATIENT.,"It would the stoutest Heart dismay,"
5878,PATIENT.,"To see, to feel, that dreadful Sight:"
5879,PATIENT.,"So swift, so pure, so cold, so bright,"
5880,PATIENT.,"They pierc’d my Frame with icy Wound,"
5881,PATIENT.,"And all that half-year’s polar Night,"
5882,PATIENT.,Those dancing Streamers wrapt me round.
5883,PATIENT.,
5884,PATIENT.,"Slowly that Darkness pass’d away,"
5885,PATIENT.,"When down upon the Earth I fell,--"
5886,PATIENT.,"Some hurried Sleep, was mine by day;"
5887,PATIENT.,"But soon as toll’d the Evening Bell,"
5888,PATIENT.,"They forc’d me on, where-ever dwell"
5889,PATIENT.,"Far-distant Men in Cities fair,"
5890,PATIENT.,"Cities of whom no Travellers tell,"
5891,PATIENT.,Nor Feet but mine were Wanderers there.
5892,PATIENT.,
5893,PATIENT.,"Their Watchmen stare, and stand aghast,"
5894,PATIENT.,As on we hurry through the dark;
5895,PATIENT.,"The Watch-light blinks, as we go past,"
5896,PATIENT.,The Watch-dog shrinks and fears to bark;
5897,PATIENT.,"The Watch-tower’s Bell sounds shrill; and, hark!"
5898,PATIENT.,The free Wind blows--we’ve left the Town--
5899,PATIENT.,"A wide Sepulchral Ground I mark,"
5900,PATIENT.,And on a Tomb-stone place me down.
5901,PATIENT.,
5902,PATIENT.,What Monuments of mighty Dead!
5903,PATIENT.,What Tombs of various kinds are found!
5904,PATIENT.,"And Stones erect, their Shadows shed,"
5905,PATIENT.,"On humble Graves, with Wickers bound;"
5906,PATIENT.,"Some risen fresh, above the Ground,"
5907,PATIENT.,"Some level with the native Clay,"
5908,PATIENT.,"What sleeping Millions wait the Sound,"
5909,PATIENT.,"“Arise, ye Dead, and come away!”"
5910,PATIENT.,
5911,PATIENT.,Alas! they stay not for that Call;
5912,PATIENT.,"Spare me this Woe! ye Dæmons, spare!--"
5913,PATIENT.,"They come! the shrowded Shadows all,--"
5914,PATIENT.,’Tis more than mortal Brain can bear!
5915,PATIENT.,"Rustling they rise, they sternly glare"
5916,PATIENT.,At Man upheld by vital Breath;
5917,PATIENT.,Who led by wicked Fiends should dare
5918,PATIENT.,To join the shadowy Troops of Death!
5919,PATIENT.,
5920,PATIENT.,"Yes! I have felt all Man can feel,"
5921,PATIENT.,Till he shall pay his Nature’s Debt;
5922,PATIENT.,"Ills that no Hope has Strength to heal,"
5923,PATIENT.,No Mind the Comfort to forget:
5924,PATIENT.,"Whatever Cares the Heart can fret,"
5925,PATIENT.,"The Spirits wear, the Temper gall;"
5926,PATIENT.,"Woe, Want, Dread, Anguish, all beset"
5927,PATIENT.,My sinful Soul!--together all!
5928,PATIENT.,
5929,PATIENT.,"Those Fiends, upon a shaking Fen,"
5930,PATIENT.,"Fix’d me, in dark tempestuous Night;"
5931,PATIENT.,"There never trod the Foot of Men,"
5932,PATIENT.,There flock’d the Fowl in wint’ry Flight;
5933,PATIENT.,"There danc’d the Moor’s deceitful Light,"
5934,PATIENT.,Above the Pool where Sedges grow;
5935,PATIENT.,"And when the Morning-Sun shone bright,"
5936,PATIENT.,It shone upon a Field of Snow.
5937,PATIENT.,
5938,PATIENT.,"They hung me on a Bough, so small,"
5939,PATIENT.,The Rook could build her Nest no higher;
5940,PATIENT.,"They fix’d me on the trembling Ball,"
5941,PATIENT.,That crowns the Steeple’s quiv’ring Spire;
5942,PATIENT.,"They set me where the Seas retire,"
5943,PATIENT.,But drown with their returning Tide;
5944,PATIENT.,"And made me flee the Mountain’s Fire,"
5945,PATIENT.,When rolling from its burning Side.
5946,PATIENT.,
5947,PATIENT.,I’ve hung upon the ridgy Steep
5948,PATIENT.,"Of Cliffs, and held the rambling Brier;"
5949,PATIENT.,"I’ve plung’d below the billowy Deep,"
5950,PATIENT.,Where Air was sent me to respire;
5951,PATIENT.,I’ve been where hungry Wolves retire;
5952,PATIENT.,"And (to complete my Woes) I’ve ran,"
5953,PATIENT.,Where Bedlam’s crazy Crew conspire
5954,PATIENT.,Against the Life of reasoning Man.
5955,PATIENT.,
5956,PATIENT.,"I’ve furl’d in Storms the flapping Sail,"
5957,PATIENT.,By banging from the Top-mast-head;
5958,PATIENT.,"I’ve serv’d the vilest Slaves in Jail,"
5959,PATIENT.,And pick’d the Dunghill’s Spoil for Bread;
5960,PATIENT.,"I’ve made the Badger’s Hole my Bed,"
5961,PATIENT.,"I’ve wander’d with a Gipsey Crew,"
5962,PATIENT.,"I’ve dreaded all the Guilty dread,"
5963,PATIENT.,And done what they would fear to do.
5964,PATIENT.,
5965,PATIENT.,"On Sand where ebbs and flows the Flood,"
5966,PATIENT.,Midway they plac’d and bade me die;
5967,PATIENT.,"Propt on my Staff, I stoutly stood"
5968,PATIENT.,When the swift Waves came rolling by;
5969,PATIENT.,"And high they rose, and still more high,"
5970,PATIENT.,Till my Lips drank the bitter Brine;
5971,PATIENT.,"I sobb’d convuls’d, then cast mine Eye"
5972,PATIENT.,And saw the Tide’s re-flowing Sign.
5973,PATIENT.,
5974,PATIENT.,"And then, my Dreams were such as nought"
5975,PATIENT.,Could yield but my unhappy Case;
5976,PATIENT.,"I’ve been of thousand Devils caught,"
5977,PATIENT.,"And thrust into that horrid Place,"
5978,PATIENT.,"Where reign Dismay, Despair, Disgrace;"
5979,PATIENT.,"Furies with iron Fangs were there,"
5980,PATIENT.,"To torture that accursed Race,"
5981,PATIENT.,"Doom’d to Dismay, Disgrace, Despair."
5982,PATIENT.,
5983,PATIENT.,Harmless I was; yet hunted down
5984,PATIENT.,"For Treasons, to my Soul unfit;"
5985,PATIENT.,"I’ve been pursued through many a Town,"
5986,PATIENT.,For Crimes that petty Knaves commit:
5987,PATIENT.,"I’ve been adjudg’d t’ have lost my Wit,"
5988,PATIENT.,"Because I preach’d so loud and well,"
5989,PATIENT.,"And thrown into the Dungeon’s Pit,"
5990,PATIENT.,For trampling on the Pit of Hell.
5991,PATIENT.,
5992,PATIENT.,"Such were the Evils, Man of Sin,"
5993,PATIENT.,That I was fated to sustain;
5994,PATIENT.,"And add to all, without--within,"
5995,PATIENT.,"A Soul defil’d with every Stain,"
5996,PATIENT.,That Man’s reflecting Mind can pain;
5997,PATIENT.,"That Pride, Wrong, Rage, Despair can make;"
5998,PATIENT.,"In fact, they’d nearly touch’d my Brain,"
5999,PATIENT.,And Reason on her Throne would shake.
6000,PATIENT.,
6001,PATIENT.,"But Pity will the vilest seek,"
6002,PATIENT.,"If punish’d Guilt will not repine,--"
6003,PATIENT.,"I heard an heavenly Teacher speak,"
6004,PATIENT.,And felt the SUN of MERCY shine:
6005,PATIENT.,I hail’d the Light! the Birth divine!
6006,PATIENT.,And then was seal’d among the few;
6007,PATIENT.,Those angry Fiends beheld the Sign;
6008,PATIENT.,And from me in an instant flew.
6009,PATIENT.,
6010,PATIENT.,"Come hear how thus, the Charmers cry,"
6011,PATIENT.,To wandering Sheep the Strays of Sin;
6012,PATIENT.,"While some the Wicket-gate pass by,"
6013,PATIENT.,And some will knock and enter in;
6014,PATIENT.,"Full joyful ’tis a Soul to win,"
6015,PATIENT.,For he that winneth Souls is wise;
6016,PATIENT.,"Now hark! the holy Strains begin,"
6017,PATIENT.,And thus the sainted Preacher cries[18]:--
6018,PATIENT.,
6019,PATIENT.,"“Pilgrim burthen’d with thy Sin,"
6020,PATIENT.,"“Come the way to Zion’s Gate,"
6021,PATIENT.,"“There, till Mercy lets thee in,"
6022,PATIENT.,“Knock and weep and watch and wait.
6023,PATIENT.,“Knock!--He knows the Sinner’s Cry;
6024,PATIENT.,“Weep!--He loves the Mourner’s Tears:
6025,PATIENT.,"“Watch!--for, saving Grace is nigh:"
6026,PATIENT.,"“Wait,--till heavenly Light appears.”"
6027,PATIENT.,
6028,PATIENT.,“Hark! it is the Bridegroom’s Voice:
6029,PATIENT.,"“Welcome, Pilgrim, to thy Rest;"
6030,PATIENT.,"“Now within the Gate rejoice,"
6031,PATIENT.,“Safe and seal’d and bought and blest!
6032,PATIENT.,"“Safe--from all the Lures of Vice,"
6033,PATIENT.,"“Seal’d--by Signs the Chosen know,"
6034,PATIENT.,"“Bought by Love and Life the Price,"
6035,PATIENT.,“Blest--the mighty Debt to owe.
6036,PATIENT.,
6037,PATIENT.,"“Holy Pilgrim! what for thee,"
6038,PATIENT.,“In a World like this remain?
6039,PATIENT.,"“From thy guarded Breast shall flee,"
6040,PATIENT.,"“Fear and Shame, and Doubt and Pain."
6041,PATIENT.,"“Fear--the Hope of Heaven shall fly,"
6042,PATIENT.,"“Shame--from Glory’s View retire,"
6043,PATIENT.,"“Doubt--in certain Rapture die,"
6044,PATIENT.,“Pain--in endless Bliss expire.”
6045,PATIENT.,
6046,PATIENT.,"But though my Day of Grace was come,"
6047,PATIENT.,Yet still my Days of Grief I find;
6048,PATIENT.,"The former Clouds’ collected Gloom,"
6049,PATIENT.,Still sadden the reflecting Mind;
6050,PATIENT.,"The Soul to evil Things consign’d,"
6051,PATIENT.,Will of their Evil some retain;
6052,PATIENT.,"The Man will seem to Earth inclin’d,"
6053,PATIENT.,And will not look erect again.
6054,PATIENT.,
6055,PATIENT.,"Thus, though elect, I feel it hard,"
6056,PATIENT.,"To lose what I possess’d before,"
6057,PATIENT.,"To be from all my Wealth debarr’d,--"
6058,PATIENT.,The brave _Sir Eustace_ is no more;
6059,PATIENT.,"But old I wax and passing poor,"
6060,PATIENT.,"Stern, rugged Men my Conduct view;"
6061,PATIENT.,"They chide my Wish, they bar my Door,"
