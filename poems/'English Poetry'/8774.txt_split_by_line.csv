199,TO THE DAISY.,TO THE DAISY.
200,TO THE DAISY.,
201,TO THE DAISY.,In youth from rock to rock I went
202,TO THE DAISY.,"From hill to hill, in discontent"
203,TO THE DAISY.,"Of pleasure high and turbulent,"
204,TO THE DAISY.,Most pleas'd when most uneasy;
205,TO THE DAISY.,"But now my own delights I make,"
206,TO THE DAISY.,"My thirst at every rill can slake,"
207,TO THE DAISY.,And gladly Nature's love partake
208,TO THE DAISY.,"Of thee, sweet Daisy!"
209,TO THE DAISY.,
210,TO THE DAISY.,"When soothed a while by milder airs,"
211,TO THE DAISY.,Thee Winter in the garland wears                         10
212,TO THE DAISY.,That thinly shades his few grey hairs;
213,TO THE DAISY.,Spring cannot shun thee;
214,TO THE DAISY.,Whole summer fields are thine by right;
215,TO THE DAISY.,"And Autumn, melancholy Wight!"
216,TO THE DAISY.,Doth in thy crimson head delight
217,TO THE DAISY.,When rains are on thee.
218,TO THE DAISY.,
219,TO THE DAISY.,"In shoals and bands, a morrice train,"
220,TO THE DAISY.,Thou greet'st the Traveller in the lane;
221,TO THE DAISY.,If welcome once thou count'st it gain;
222,TO THE DAISY.,"Thou art not daunted,                           20"
223,TO THE DAISY.,Nor car'st if thou be set at naught;
224,TO THE DAISY.,And oft alone in nooks remote
225,TO THE DAISY.,"We meet thee, like a pleasant thought,"
226,TO THE DAISY.,When such are wanted.
227,TO THE DAISY.,
228,TO THE DAISY.,Be Violets in their secret mews
229,TO THE DAISY.,The flowers the wanton Zephyrs chuse;
230,TO THE DAISY.,"Proud be the Rose, with rains and dews"
231,TO THE DAISY.,Her head impearling;
232,TO THE DAISY.,"Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim,"
233,TO THE DAISY.,Yet hast not gone without thy fame;                      30
234,TO THE DAISY.,Thou art indeed by many a claim
235,TO THE DAISY.,The Poet's darling.
236,TO THE DAISY.,
237,TO THE DAISY.,"If to a rock from rains he fly,"
238,TO THE DAISY.,"Or, some bright day of April sky,"
239,TO THE DAISY.,Imprison'd by hot sunshine lie
240,TO THE DAISY.,"Near the green holly,"
241,TO THE DAISY.,And wearily at length should fare;
242,TO THE DAISY.,"He need but look about, and there"
243,TO THE DAISY.,"Thou art! a Friend at hand, to scare"
244,TO THE DAISY.,His melancholy.                                  40
245,TO THE DAISY.,
246,TO THE DAISY.,"A hundred times, by rock or bower,"
247,TO THE DAISY.,"Ere thus I have lain couch'd an hour,"
248,TO THE DAISY.,Have I derived from thy sweet power
249,TO THE DAISY.,Some apprehension;
250,TO THE DAISY.,Some steady love; some brief delight;
251,TO THE DAISY.,Some memory that had taken flight;
252,TO THE DAISY.,Some chime of fancy wrong or right;
253,TO THE DAISY.,Or stray invention.
254,TO THE DAISY.,
255,TO THE DAISY.,"If stately passions in me burn,"
256,TO THE DAISY.,"And one chance look to Thee should turn,                 50"
257,TO THE DAISY.,I drink out of an humbler urn
258,TO THE DAISY.,A lowlier pleasure;
259,TO THE DAISY.,The homely sympathy that heeds
260,TO THE DAISY.,"The common life, our nature breeds;"
261,TO THE DAISY.,A wisdom fitted to the needs
262,TO THE DAISY.,Of hearts at leisure.
263,TO THE DAISY.,
264,TO THE DAISY.,"When, smitten by the morning ray,"
265,TO THE DAISY.,"I see thee rise alert and gay,"
266,TO THE DAISY.,"Then, chearful Flower! my spirits play"
267,TO THE DAISY.,With kindred motion:                             60
268,TO THE DAISY.,"At dusk, I've seldom mark'd thee press"
269,TO THE DAISY.,"The ground, as if in thankfulness,"
270,TO THE DAISY.,"Without some feeling, more or less,"
271,TO THE DAISY.,Of true devotion.
272,TO THE DAISY.,
273,TO THE DAISY.,"And all day long I number yet,"
274,TO THE DAISY.,"All seasons through, another debt,"
275,TO THE DAISY.,"Which I wherever thou art met,"
276,TO THE DAISY.,To thee am owing;
277,TO THE DAISY.,"An instinct call it, a blind sense;"
278,TO THE DAISY.,"A happy, genial influence,                               70"
279,TO THE DAISY.,"Coming one knows not how nor whence,"
280,TO THE DAISY.,Nor whither going.
281,TO THE DAISY.,
282,TO THE DAISY.,Child of the Year! that round dost run
283,TO THE DAISY.,"Thy course, bold lover of the sun,"
284,TO THE DAISY.,And chearful when the day's begun
285,TO THE DAISY.,"As morning Leveret,"
286,TO THE DAISY.,Thou long the Poet's praise shalt gain;
287,TO THE DAISY.,Thou wilt be more belov'd by men
288,TO THE DAISY.,In times to come; thou not in vain
289,TO THE DAISY.,Art Nature's Favorite.                            80

297,LOUISA.,
298,LOUISA.,I met Louisa in the shade;
299,LOUISA.,"And, having seen that lovely Maid,"
300,LOUISA.,Why should I fear to say
301,LOUISA.,"That she is ruddy, fleet, and strong;"
302,LOUISA.,"And down the rocks can leap along,"
303,LOUISA.,Like rivulets in May?
304,LOUISA.,
305,LOUISA.,And she hath smiles to earth unknown;
306,LOUISA.,"Smiles, that with motion of their own"
307,LOUISA.,"Do spread, and sink, and rise;"
308,LOUISA.,"That come and go with endless play,                      10"
309,LOUISA.,"And ever, as they pass away,"
310,LOUISA.,Are hidden in her eyes.
311,LOUISA.,
312,LOUISA.,"She loves her fire, her Cottage-home;"
313,LOUISA.,Yet o'er the moorland will she roam
314,LOUISA.,In weather rough and bleak;
315,LOUISA.,"And when against the wind she strains,"
316,LOUISA.,Oh! might I kiss the mountain rains
317,LOUISA.,That sparkle on her cheek.
318,LOUISA.,
319,LOUISA.,"Take all that's mine 'beneath the moon',"
320,LOUISA.,If I with her but half a noon                            20
321,LOUISA.,May sit beneath the walls
322,LOUISA.,"Of some old cave, or mossy nook,"
323,LOUISA.,"When up she winds along the brook,"
324,LOUISA.,To hunt the waterfalls.

332,FIDELITY.,
333,FIDELITY.,"A barking sound the Shepherd hears,"
334,FIDELITY.,A cry as of a Dog or Fox;
335,FIDELITY.,"He halts, and searches with his eyes"
336,FIDELITY.,Among the scatter'd rocks:
337,FIDELITY.,And now at distance can discern
338,FIDELITY.,A stirring in a brake of fern;
339,FIDELITY.,From which immediately leaps out
340,FIDELITY.,"A Dog, and yelping runs about."
341,FIDELITY.,
342,FIDELITY.,The Dog is not of mountain breed;
343,FIDELITY.,"It's motions, too, are wild and shy;                      10"
344,FIDELITY.,"With something, as the Shepherd thinks,"
345,FIDELITY.,Unusual in its' cry:
346,FIDELITY.,Nor is there any one in sight
347,FIDELITY.,"All round, in Hollow or on Height;"
348,FIDELITY.,"Nor shout, nor whistle strikes his ear;"
349,FIDELITY.,What is the Creature doing here?
350,FIDELITY.,
351,FIDELITY.,"It was a Cove, a huge Recess,"
352,FIDELITY.,That keeps till June December's snow;
353,FIDELITY.,"A lofty Precipice in front,"
354,FIDELITY.,A silent Tarn [1] below!                                  20
355,FIDELITY.,"Far in the bosom of Helvellyn,"
356,FIDELITY.,"Remote from public Road or Dwelling,"
357,FIDELITY.,"Pathway, or cultivated land;"
358,FIDELITY.,From trace of human foot or hand.
359,FIDELITY.,
360,FIDELITY.,[Footnote 1: A Tarn is a small Mere or Lake mostly high up in the
361,FIDELITY.,mountains.]
362,FIDELITY.,
363,FIDELITY.,"There, sometimes does a leaping Fish"
364,FIDELITY.,Send through the Tarn a lonely chear;
365,FIDELITY.,"The Crags repeat the Raven's croak,"
366,FIDELITY.,In symphony austere;
367,FIDELITY.,"Thither the Rainbow comes, the Cloud;"
368,FIDELITY.,And Mists that spread the flying shroud;                 30
369,FIDELITY.,"And Sun-beams; and the sounding blast,"
370,FIDELITY.,"That, if it could, would hurry past,"
371,FIDELITY.,But that enormous Barrier binds it fast.
372,FIDELITY.,
373,FIDELITY.,"Not knowing what to think, a while"
374,FIDELITY.,The Shepherd stood: then makes his way
375,FIDELITY.,"Towards the Dog, o'er rocks and stones,"
376,FIDELITY.,As quickly as he may;
377,FIDELITY.,Nor far had gone before he found
378,FIDELITY.,"A human skeleton on the ground,"
379,FIDELITY.,Sad sight! the Shepherd with a sigh                      40
380,FIDELITY.,"Looks round, to learn the history."
381,FIDELITY.,
382,FIDELITY.,"From those abrupt and perilous rocks,"
383,FIDELITY.,"The Man had fallen, that place of fear!"
384,FIDELITY.,At length upon the Shepherd's mind
385,FIDELITY.,"It breaks, and all is clear:"
386,FIDELITY.,"He instantly recall'd the Name,"
387,FIDELITY.,"And who he was, and whence he came;"
388,FIDELITY.,"Remember'd, too, the very day"
389,FIDELITY.,On which the Traveller pass'd this way.
390,FIDELITY.,
391,FIDELITY.,"But hear a wonder now, for sake                          50"
392,FIDELITY.,Of which this mournful Tale I tell!
393,FIDELITY.,A lasting monument of words
394,FIDELITY.,This wonder merits well.
395,FIDELITY.,"The Dog, which still was hovering nigh,"
396,FIDELITY.,"Repeating the same timid cry,"
397,FIDELITY.,This Dog had been through three months' space
398,FIDELITY.,A Dweller in that savage place.
399,FIDELITY.,
400,FIDELITY.,"Yes, proof was plain that since the day"
401,FIDELITY.,On which the Traveller thus had died
402,FIDELITY.,"The Dog had watch'd about the spot,                      60"
403,FIDELITY.,Or by his Master's side:
404,FIDELITY.,How nourish'd here through such long time
405,FIDELITY.,"He knows, who gave that love sublime,"
406,FIDELITY.,"And gave that strength of feeling, great"
407,FIDELITY.,Above all human estimate.

1546,4. ALICE FELL.,When suddenly I seem'd to hear
1547,4. ALICE FELL.,"A moan, a lamentable sound."
1548,4. ALICE FELL.,
1549,4. ALICE FELL.,As if the wind blew many ways
1550,4. ALICE FELL.,"I heard the sound, and more and more:"
1551,4. ALICE FELL.,"It seem'd to follow with the Chaise,"

1553,4. ALICE FELL.,
1554,4. ALICE FELL.,"At length I to the Boy call'd out,"

1574,4. ALICE FELL.,"""What ails you, Child?"" she sobb'd, ""Look here!"""
1575,4. ALICE FELL.,"I saw it in the wheel entangled,"

1692,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"I watch'd him, he continuing motionless:"
1693,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,To the Pool's further margin then I drew;

1706,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"His body was bent double, feet and head"
1707,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,Coming together in their pilgrimage;
1708,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage"
1709,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"Of sickness felt by him in times long past,"
1710,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.
1711,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,
1712,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"Himself he propp'd, his body, limbs, and face,"
1713,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,Upon a long grey Staff of shaven wood:
1714,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"And, still as I drew near with gentle pace,                80"
1715,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,Beside the little pond or moorish flood
1716,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,Motionless as a Cloud the Old Man stood;
1717,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,That heareth not the loud winds when they call;
1718,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"And moveth altogether, if it move at all."

1727,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,
1728,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"A gentle answer did the Old Man make,"
1729,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew:

1731,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"""What kind of work is that which you pursue?"
1732,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"This is a lonesome place for one like you."""
1733,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,He answer'd me with pleasure and surprize;
1734,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"And there was, while he spake, a fire about his eyes."
1735,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,
1736,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"His words came feebly, from a feeble chest,"
1737,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"Yet each in solemn order follow'd each,                   100"
1738,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,With something of a lofty utterance drest;
1739,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"Choice word, and measured phrase; above the reach"
1740,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,Of ordinary men; a stately speech!
1741,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use,"
1742,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"Religious men, who give to God and Man their dues."
1743,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,
1744,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,He told me that he to this pond had come
1745,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"To gather Leeches, being old and poor:"
1746,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,Employment hazardous and wearisome!
1747,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,And he had many hardships to endure:
1748,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"From Pond to Pond he roam'd, from moor to moor,           110"
1749,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance:"
1750,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,And in this way he gain'd an honest maintenance.
1751,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,
1752,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,The Old Man still stood talking by my side;
1753,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,But now his voice to me was like a stream
1754,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide;
1755,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,And the whole Body of the man did seem
1756,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,Like one whom I had met with in a dream;
1757,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,Or like a Man from some far region sent;
1758,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"To give me human strength, and strong admonishment."
1759,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,
1760,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,My former thoughts return'd: the fear that kills;         120
1761,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,The hope that is unwilling to be fed;
1762,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;"
1763,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,And mighty Poets in their misery dead.
1764,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"And now, not knowing what the Old Man had said,"
1765,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"My question eagerly did I renew,"
1766,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,"""How is it that you live, and what is it you do?"""
1767,5. RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE.,
