140,_CHREMES._,"GOOD morning, sir! good morning!"
141,_CHREMES._,
142,_CHREMES._,(_Aside._) He does not hear me.—Sir!
143,_CHREMES._,Good morning!
144,_CHREMES._,
145,_CHREMES._,(_Aside._) No: he goes on digging away for his life—
146,_CHREMES._,Ho! Menedemus! Ho!
147,_CHREMES._,
148,_MENEDEMUS._,_MENEDEMUS._
149,_MENEDEMUS._,
150,_MENEDEMUS._,Who is it calls?
151,_MENEDEMUS._,
152,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                       ’Tis I.
153,_MENEDEMUS._,
154,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._ Chremes! why, what’s the matter?"
155,_MENEDEMUS._,
156,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                 I only said good morning.
157,_MENEDEMUS._,I wish you the compliments of the day. ’Tis the feast of Bacchus.
158,_MENEDEMUS._,
159,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ I thank you. The same to you.
160,_MENEDEMUS._,
161,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._               I had something to say besides,"
162,_MENEDEMUS._,If you are at leisure.
163,_MENEDEMUS._,
164,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._             Now?
165,_MENEDEMUS._,
166,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._                Yes, now."
167,_MENEDEMUS._,
168,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._                       You see I am busy:
169,_MENEDEMUS._,But if ’tis a matter of any importance—
170,_MENEDEMUS._,
171,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                               Indeed it is.
172,_MENEDEMUS._,
173,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ Pray step to the gate: I’ll open it for you.
174,_MENEDEMUS._,
175,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                           You are very good.
176,_MENEDEMUS._,(_Aside._) How fagged he looks!
177,_MENEDEMUS._,
178,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._                       Come in. You will not think me rude,"
179,_MENEDEMUS._,If I ask you to tell your errand while I dig.
180,_MENEDEMUS._,
181,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._                                  Excuse me,                11"
182,_MENEDEMUS._,"My good friend; and your spade, pray you, awhile put down."
183,_MENEDEMUS._,You must stop working.
184,_MENEDEMUS._,
185,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._            No: I cannot rest a minute.
186,_MENEDEMUS._,
187,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ I can’t allow it indeed. (_Taking the spade._)
188,_MENEDEMUS._,
189,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._                      Now, sir, you wrong me."
190,_MENEDEMUS._,
191,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                                           Hey!
192,_MENEDEMUS._,My word! what a weight it is!
193,_MENEDEMUS._,
194,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._                   It’s not too heavy for me.
195,_MENEDEMUS._,
196,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._ Come! what’s all this? well take it again, but don’t"
197,_MENEDEMUS._,refuse me
198,_MENEDEMUS._,A moment’s attention.
199,_MENEDEMUS._,
200,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._           Well!
201,_MENEDEMUS._,
202,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._              ’Tis a matter concerns you nearly:
203,_MENEDEMUS._,"So leave your work, and come outside, and sit on the bench,"
204,_MENEDEMUS._,Where we may talk.
205,_MENEDEMUS._,
206,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._         Whatever you have to say, Chremes,"
207,_MENEDEMUS._,May be said here.
208,_MENEDEMUS._,
209,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._       No doubt; but better as I propose:                   20
210,_MENEDEMUS._,I will not detain you long.
211,_MENEDEMUS._,
212,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._                 What is it?
213,_MENEDEMUS._,
214,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                          Sit you down.
215,_MENEDEMUS._,
216,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ You have something to say.
217,_MENEDEMUS._,
218,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                         Not while you stand.
219,_MENEDEMUS._,
220,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._ (_sitting_).              Well, as you will."
221,_MENEDEMUS._,And now in as few words as may be ... I am at your service.—
222,_MENEDEMUS._,Explain.
223,_MENEDEMUS._,
224,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._ Menedemus, although our acquaintance has been but short,"
225,_MENEDEMUS._,And only dates from the day you bought this piece of land.
226,_MENEDEMUS._,And came to live close by me: for little or nought but that
227,_MENEDEMUS._,"Occasioned it, as you know: yet my respect for you,"
228,_MENEDEMUS._,"Or else your being a neighbour, for that itself, I take it,"
229,_MENEDEMUS._,"Counts in some sort as friendship, makes me bold and free"
230,_MENEDEMUS._,"To give you a piece of advice: the fact is, you seem to me        30"
231,_MENEDEMUS._,"To be working here in a manner, which both to your time of life"
232,_MENEDEMUS._,"And station, is most unsuitable. What, in Heaven’s name,"
233,_MENEDEMUS._,Can be your object? what do you drive at? To guess your age
234,_MENEDEMUS._,You are sixty years at least. There’s no one hereabouts
235,_MENEDEMUS._,"Can shew a better farm, nor more servants upon it:"
236,_MENEDEMUS._,"And yet you do the work yourself, as tho’ you had none."
237,_MENEDEMUS._,"Never do I go out, however early in the morning,"
238,_MENEDEMUS._,"Never come home again, however late at night,"
239,_MENEDEMUS._,"But here I see you digging, hoeing, or at all events"
240,_MENEDEMUS._,"Toiling at something or other. You are never a moment idle,       40"
241,_MENEDEMUS._,Nor shew regard for yourself. Now all this can’t be done
242,_MENEDEMUS._,"For pleasure, that I am sure of, and as for any profit,"
243,_MENEDEMUS._,"Why, if you only applied half the energy"
244,_MENEDEMUS._,"To stirring up your servants, both you and your farm"
245,_MENEDEMUS._,Would do much better.
246,_MENEDEMUS._,
247,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._ Have you so much spare time then, Chremes,"
248,_MENEDEMUS._,Left from your own affairs to meddle with other people’s?
249,_MENEDEMUS._,The which moreover do not concern you.
250,_MENEDEMUS._,
251,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                           I am a man.
252,_MENEDEMUS._,"Nought which concerns mankind concerns not me, I think."
253,_MENEDEMUS._,"Ere I advise, I’d first enquire what ’tis you do;                 49"
254,_MENEDEMUS._,"If well, to learn by example; if ill, then to dissuade."
255,_MENEDEMUS._,
256,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ My duty is this: do you as best may suit yourself.
257,_MENEDEMUS._,
258,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ What man can say ’tis right for him to torment himself?
259,_MENEDEMUS._,
260,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ I can.
261,_MENEDEMUS._,
262,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._     If it is any sorrow or trouble that has driven you to this,"
263,_MENEDEMUS._,"I am very sorry. But ... what is it? Tell me, I pray."
264,_MENEDEMUS._,"Whatever can you have done, that calls for such a penance?"
265,_MENEDEMUS._,
266,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ Ay me!
267,_MENEDEMUS._,
268,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ Come! don’t give way: confide to me this affair.
269,_MENEDEMUS._,"Trust me: keep nothing back, I entreat you: have no fear."
270,_MENEDEMUS._,"Surely I may either help, or advise, or at least console you."
271,_MENEDEMUS._,
272,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ You really wish to know?
273,_MENEDEMUS._,
274,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._                    Yes, for the reason I gave."
275,_MENEDEMUS._,
276,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ I’ll tell you.
277,_MENEDEMUS._,
278,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._          What is it?
279,_MENEDEMUS._,
280,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._                 I have an only son, Chremes—"
281,_MENEDEMUS._,Alas what say I? have? had I should rather say;
282,_MENEDEMUS._,"For whether now I have or not, I cannot tell.                     62"
283,_MENEDEMUS._,
284,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ How so?
285,_MENEDEMUS._,
286,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._       You shall hear: attend. There came to live in the city
287,_MENEDEMUS._,"A poor old widow woman from Corinth. She had a daughter,"
288,_MENEDEMUS._,"With whom my son, who is just of age, fell madly in love,"
289,_MENEDEMUS._,Was even at the point to marry: and all without my knowledge.
290,_MENEDEMUS._,However it came to my ears; and then I began to treat him
291,_MENEDEMUS._,"Unkindly, and not in the way to deal with a love-sick lad;"
292,_MENEDEMUS._,But after the usual dictatorial manner of fathers.                69
293,_MENEDEMUS._,"I never left him in peace. _Don’t think, my fine fellow_,"
294,_MENEDEMUS._,"I’d say, _that you’ll be allowed to continue behaving thus,"
295,_MENEDEMUS._,While I am alive to prevent it; running after a girl
296,_MENEDEMUS._,"And talking of marrying too: you are very much mistaken,"
297,_MENEDEMUS._,"Clinia, if you think that. You don’t know me. I am glad"
298,_MENEDEMUS._,"To have you called my son, while you respect your honour;"
299,_MENEDEMUS._,"But if you once forget it, I shall find a means,"
300,_MENEDEMUS._,"And one you will not like, of asserting my own. All this"
301,_MENEDEMUS._,"I see very plainly_, I said, _has come from idle habits."
302,_MENEDEMUS._,You have not enough to do. When I was your age
303,_MENEDEMUS._,I did not fritter away my time in making love;_                   80
304,_MENEDEMUS._,"_But finding my pockets empty, set out for Asia,"
305,_MENEDEMUS._,And won myself distinction and fortune in foreign service._
306,_MENEDEMUS._,"At last, Chremes, it came to this: the poor young fellow,"
307,_MENEDEMUS._,"Continually hearing the same thing put so strongly to him,"
308,_MENEDEMUS._,Gave in: he thought my age and due regard for his welfare
309,_MENEDEMUS._,Were likely to shew him a wiser and more prudent course
310,_MENEDEMUS._,"Than his own feelings;—he left the country, and went to fight"
311,_MENEDEMUS._,Under the king of Persia.
312,_MENEDEMUS._,
313,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                Indeed?
314,_MENEDEMUS._,
315,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._                     He started off
316,_MENEDEMUS._,One day without a word. He has now been gone six months.
317,_MENEDEMUS._,
318,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ Both were to blame; however I think the step that he took  90
319,_MENEDEMUS._,Was the act of a modest and not unmanly disposition.
320,_MENEDEMUS._,
321,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._ I enquired of some of his friends, and when I learnt"
322,_MENEDEMUS._,"the truth,"
323,_MENEDEMUS._,"I returned home to my house miserable, my mind"
324,_MENEDEMUS._,Unhinged—distracted with grief. I sat me down; my servants
325,_MENEDEMUS._,"Came running to know my pleasure; some drew off my shoes,"
326,_MENEDEMUS._,"Others were hastening to and fro to prepare my dinner,"
327,_MENEDEMUS._,Each anxious by doing his best to lessen the pain
328,_MENEDEMUS._,"Of my great misfortune: in vain: the sight of them made me think,"
329,_MENEDEMUS._,‘What! is it then for me alone that all these persons
330,_MENEDEMUS._,So busily are engaged? all for my comfort?                       100
331,_MENEDEMUS._,For me is it that so many women are spinning; for me
332,_MENEDEMUS._,This great household expense & luxury are maintained?
333,_MENEDEMUS._,"And my only son, who in all should equally share with me—"
334,_MENEDEMUS._,"Nay, should have the larger share, since at his age he is able"
335,_MENEDEMUS._,"Better to use such things & enjoy them—him, poor boy,"
336,_MENEDEMUS._,"I have driven out of the house by my unkindness. No,"
337,_MENEDEMUS._,I had rather die than do it. While he leads a life
338,_MENEDEMUS._,"Of poverty & of hardship, exiled from home & country"
339,_MENEDEMUS._,"By my severe treatment, so long will I visit                     109"
340,_MENEDEMUS._,"His punishment on myself, labouring, fasting, saving,"
341,_MENEDEMUS._,Serving and slaving for him.’ I began there and then;
342,_MENEDEMUS._,"I stripped the house for a sale, left nothing in it, not a dish"
343,_MENEDEMUS._,"To eat off, not a coat to put on. I collected everything:"
344,_MENEDEMUS._,"And as for the men and maids, excepting such as were able"
345,_MENEDEMUS._,"To work the cost of their living out on my fields, I sent them"
346,_MENEDEMUS._,"To market and sold them, I put up a notice, THIS HOUSE TO LET;"
347,_MENEDEMUS._,"And setting the price of all, some fifty talents, together,"
348,_MENEDEMUS._,"I bought this farm, and am well convinced at heart, Chremes,"
349,_MENEDEMUS._,That in making myself miserable I act more justly
350,_MENEDEMUS._,"Towards him, my absent son; and that ’twere crime to indulge     120"
351,_MENEDEMUS._,"In any comfort, till he return home safe again"
352,_MENEDEMUS._,To share it with me.
353,_MENEDEMUS._,
354,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._         I see that you are a kind father;
355,_MENEDEMUS._,"And he, I think, had been a dutiful son, if treated"
356,_MENEDEMUS._,"With moderation and judgment: but look, you did not know"
357,_MENEDEMUS._,Each other well enough: a common fault to observe
358,_MENEDEMUS._,"In family life, and one destructive of happiness."
359,_MENEDEMUS._,"You never let him perceive how dear he was to you,"
360,_MENEDEMUS._,"So he dared not confide in you, when it was his duty:"
361,_MENEDEMUS._,To have done the one or other had spared you this misfortune.
362,_MENEDEMUS._,
363,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._ ’Tis as you say, I admit; but I was the more to blame.    130"
364,_MENEDEMUS._,
365,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ True. And to lose a child is deplorable. I had myself
366,_MENEDEMUS._,"The same misfortune without my fault. A daughter it was,"
367,_MENEDEMUS._,"Stolen from me I know not how: my second child, a babe."
368,_MENEDEMUS._,"That’s fifteen years ago. I was living at Ephesus,"
369,_MENEDEMUS._,Where such events are regarded as commonish accidents.
370,_MENEDEMUS._,"I know not where she was taken, have never heard of her since;"
371,_MENEDEMUS._,"And tho’ I have not forgot it, my own experience is,"
372,_MENEDEMUS._,One does entirely get over the sort of thing—I assure you.
373,_MENEDEMUS._,
374,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ ’Tis kind of you thus to recall your sorrow to comfort mine.
375,_MENEDEMUS._,My condolence can make a distinction: the child you lost         140
376,_MENEDEMUS._,"Was a daughter, a babe, you say. Clinia was my only son,"
377,_MENEDEMUS._,Grown up. Besides you admit you were not at all to blame:
378,_MENEDEMUS._,"I brought this on myself. See, friend, the difference!"
379,_MENEDEMUS._,
380,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._ However I see no reason yet to despair, Menedemus."
381,_MENEDEMUS._,"You will have him safe at home again, and soon, I am sure."
382,_MENEDEMUS._,
383,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ The gods grant it.
384,_MENEDEMUS._,
385,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._               They will. And now, ’tis the feast of Bacchus;"
386,_MENEDEMUS._,"We keep a birthday too. I hope, if it is agreeable,"
387,_MENEDEMUS._,That you will come and dine at my house.
388,_MENEDEMUS._,
389,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._                             I can’t.
390,_MENEDEMUS._,
391,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                                  Why not?
392,_MENEDEMUS._,"Do pray now, after all you have done, allow yourself"
393,_MENEDEMUS._,This little relaxation. Think your absent son                    150
394,_MENEDEMUS._,Is asking you through me.
395,_MENEDEMUS._,
396,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._              It is not right that I,"
397,_MENEDEMUS._,"Who have driven him into hardships, should spend my time"
398,_MENEDEMUS._,in pleasures.
399,_MENEDEMUS._,
400,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ You will not change your mind?
401,_MENEDEMUS._,
402,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._                          No.
403,_MENEDEMUS._,
404,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                             Then I’ll say good-bye.
405,_MENEDEMUS._,
406,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._ Good-bye.                                            [_Exit._
407,_MENEDEMUS._,
408,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._     A tear, I do believe; I am sorry for him."
409,_MENEDEMUS._,’Tis lamentable to see goodness punished thus
410,_MENEDEMUS._,"For lack of a little wisdom. Folly brings remorse,"
411,_MENEDEMUS._,And again remorse folly: they tread the circle; and he
412,_MENEDEMUS._,"Would mend one fault by another, and on himself revenge"
413,_MENEDEMUS._,The wrong he has done his son. And that wrong too was not        159
414,_MENEDEMUS._,A real unkindness: no: mere want of common sense;
415,_MENEDEMUS._,"It’s what I am always saying,—that is evil. To quote"
416,_MENEDEMUS._,"From the very profoundest of authors, my favourite Sophocles,"
417,_MENEDEMUS._,_Wisdom is far away the chiefest of happiness._
418,_MENEDEMUS._,"Of course a man may be happy, although he has lost his son,"
419,_MENEDEMUS._,If it cannot be charged to his fault. In spite of the
420,_MENEDEMUS._,best intentions
421,_MENEDEMUS._,"Menedemus is much to blame. Poor fellow, but I may assist him."
422,_MENEDEMUS._,"And if I can, I will. I love to help a neighbour;"
423,_MENEDEMUS._,’Tis pleasure as well as duty: because it is a pleasure
424,_MENEDEMUS._,"To be wiser than others, and even a friend’s predicament"
425,_MENEDEMUS._,"Increases the satisfaction I feel, when I think how well         170"
426,_MENEDEMUS._,"My own household is managed. But stay, ’tis time I went"
427,_MENEDEMUS._,To see that all’s in order for the feast we hold to-night.
428,_MENEDEMUS._,"There are one or two old friends, who’d take it much amiss"
429,_MENEDEMUS._,Did I not ask them. Now at once I’ll go and find them.      [_Exit._
430,_MENEDEMUS._,
431,_MENEDEMUS._,_Enter Pamphilus and Clinia._
432,_MENEDEMUS._,
433,_PAMPHILUS._,_PAMPHILUS._
434,_PAMPHILUS._,
435,_PAMPHILUS._,That queer old boy’s my father: didn’t you know him?
436,_PAMPHILUS._,
437,_CLINIA._,_CLINIA._
438,_CLINIA._,
439,_CLINIA._,No.
440,_CLINIA._,How should I? but his name I know—Chremes.
441,_CLINIA._,
442,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                                You have it.
443,_CLINIA._,Take care he hear not your name.
444,_CLINIA._,
445,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._                    Why so, Pamphilus?"
446,_CLINIA._,What can he know of me? and if he knew ...
447,_CLINIA._,
448,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                               See, Clinia,"
449,_CLINIA._,"That is our house, & here the hedge & paling bounds"
450,_CLINIA._,Your father’s.
451,_CLINIA._,
452,_CLINIA._,_Clin._     Here?
453,_CLINIA._,
454,_CLINIA._,_Pam._         You see what a stroke of luck it was
455,_CLINIA._,To meet me when you did. You must have betrayed yourself         181
456,_CLINIA._,"By making enquiries, but I at the merest hint have led you"
457,_CLINIA._,"Straight to the place: besides, if you wish to be near your father"
458,_CLINIA._,"Without his knowing that you are returned, my governor"
459,_CLINIA._,Can put you up.
460,_CLINIA._,
461,_CLINIA._,_Clin._   Is it here?
462,_CLINIA._,
463,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                Yes, there."
464,_CLINIA._,
465,_CLINIA._,_Clin._                           For heaven’s sake
466,_CLINIA._,Be careful; may he not see me?
467,_CLINIA._,
468,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                   If he looked over the myrtles
469,_CLINIA._,No doubt he might.
470,_CLINIA._,
471,_CLINIA._,_Clin._      Hush! hush! He’ll hear you.
472,_CLINIA._,
473,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                                   All serene.
474,_CLINIA._,He’s not this side: stand there: I’ll go & spy around.
475,_CLINIA._,Keep out of sight.
476,_CLINIA._,
477,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._      Stay, Pamphilus; are you really sure"
478,_CLINIA._,This is my father’s?
479,_CLINIA._,
480,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._         This is the place they told me, and here"
481,_CLINIA._,"A Menedemus lives, and has for the last six months."
482,_CLINIA._,We’re right enough.
483,_CLINIA._,
484,_CLINIA._,_Clin._       I fear he’ll see us: pray come back.
485,_CLINIA._,
486,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ I thought you wished to see him.
487,_CLINIA._,
488,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._                           Ay, and so I do;"
489,_CLINIA._,"But nothing less in the world, if it should be the occasion      194"
490,_CLINIA._,Of his seeing me.
491,_CLINIA._,
492,_CLINIA._,_Pam._      Trust me: he won’t. I’ll speer about.
493,_CLINIA._,He’s sure to be digging somewhere near.
494,_CLINIA._,
495,_CLINIA._,_Clin._                             Digging?
496,_CLINIA._,
497,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                                     If not,"
498,_CLINIA._,It is not old Menedemus.      (_Goes round peering._)
499,_CLINIA._,
500,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._            Oh what can it mean,"
501,_CLINIA._,My father’s sudden change of home and manner of life?
502,_CLINIA._,He that so loved the town: himself the very centre
503,_CLINIA._,"Of all good company, the best invited man,                       200"
504,_CLINIA._,And most besought in Athens. Nothing but great disgust
505,_CLINIA._,"Could thus have turned his temper. I am the cause, and one"
506,_CLINIA._,Of two things it must be; either he is more offended with me
507,_CLINIA._,"Than I supposed; or else, and this I hope and think,"
508,_CLINIA._,"My flight, breaking the bond that surely was the nearest"
509,_CLINIA._,"And dearest to him, has wrought upon him, and now he turns"
510,_CLINIA._,"And will consent: if that, ’tis well I am here: if not,"
511,_CLINIA._,"He must not come to know I am back in Athens: nay,"
512,_CLINIA._,’Twould only vex him more: I must hide from him still:
513,_CLINIA._,For though there is nothing in the extremest scope of duty       210
514,_CLINIA._,"In which I would not obey him but one thing, ’tis this thing"
515,_CLINIA._,"I am pledged to. Love absolves me. Nay, ’tis not for him"
516,_CLINIA._,I am now returned. I have chosen; I am not ashamed: I made
517,_CLINIA._,"One dutiful effort—oh intolerable! I am come,"
518,_CLINIA._,"Sweetest Antiphila, to marry thee, and I will marry thee;"
519,_CLINIA._,"Without consent, if must be, against my father’s will—"
520,_CLINIA._,Yet now I have hope; and whether rightly or wrongly I hope
521,_CLINIA._,I must discover.
522,_CLINIA._,
523,_CLINIA._,(_Pamphilus returns to Clinia._)
524,_CLINIA._,
525,_CLINIA._,_Pam._     It’s very funny: he’s not to be seen.
526,_CLINIA._,
527,_CLINIA._,_Clin._ What shall I do?
528,_CLINIA._,
529,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                 To-day’s my birthday, Clinia:"
530,_CLINIA._,"We have asked some friends to come: if you will be my guest,      220"
531,_CLINIA._,Our house is very handy. No one shall hear your name.
532,_CLINIA._,My father will not suspect you.
533,_CLINIA._,
534,_CLINIA._,_Clin._                   I thank you. There’s no need.
535,_CLINIA._,
536,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ I’ll call you Clitipho.
537,_CLINIA._,
538,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._                  No, no, I am ill-disposed"
539,_CLINIA._,For company. Pray excuse me. Besides I am sure your father
540,_CLINIA._,Must be acquainted with mine.
541,_CLINIA._,
542,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                  I doubt it. He often says
543,_CLINIA._,He wonders who in the world his eccentric neighbour is.
544,_CLINIA._,"But whether he knows or not we’ll soon find out: for look,"
545,_CLINIA._,He is coming down the road. Stand back where you can hear;
546,_CLINIA._,"And if he has any knowledge that can be of use to you,"
547,_CLINIA._,I’ll worm it out.
548,_CLINIA._,
549,_CLINIA._,_Re-enter Chremes._
550,_CLINIA._,
551,_CLINIA._,"_Chr._        What are you doing, Pamphilus,                     230"
552,_CLINIA._,Looking over the hedge into our neighbour’s garden?
553,_CLINIA._,Do you not know how vulgar curiosity is?
554,_CLINIA._,Spying and prying thus into other folk’s affairs.
555,_CLINIA._,"I am quite ashamed of you, sir!"
556,_CLINIA._,
557,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                    I was only looking to see
558,_CLINIA._,"If I could catch a glimpse of old Menedemus, father."
559,_CLINIA._,I’ve found out something about him.
560,_CLINIA._,
561,_CLINIA._,_Chr._                        Eh! and what is that?
562,_CLINIA._,
563,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ Have you ever heard of Clinia?
564,_CLINIA._,
565,_CLINIA._,"_Chr._                          Clinia, Clinia? Yes—"
566,_CLINIA._,"Of course, why he’s Menedemus’ son, who is now in Persia."
567,_CLINIA._,I know about him.
568,_CLINIA._,
569,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._      Well, he’s an old school-friend of mine."
570,_CLINIA._,
571,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ Is he?
572,_CLINIA._,
573,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._        You know when first I came to school at Athens,      240"
574,_CLINIA._,"He was kind to me, and afterwards, when we all came here to live,"
575,_CLINIA._,"I met him again. I never dreamed that ’twas his father,"
576,_CLINIA._,Who took this place next door. I used to hear he was quite
577,_CLINIA._,A different sort of person.
578,_CLINIA._,
579,_CLINIA._,"_Chr._                Ay, no doubt he was."
580,_CLINIA._,The trouble his son has brought upon him has broke him down.
581,_CLINIA._,
582,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._ Why, Clinia had no debts."
583,_CLINIA._,
584,_CLINIA._,_Chr._                     Perhaps he had no debts:
585,_CLINIA._,But I could tell you more about him than you imagine.
586,_CLINIA._,"I have never been able to take any pleasure, Pamphilus,"
587,_CLINIA._,In any one of your friendships; and now I am grieved to find
588,_CLINIA._,"You are intimate with this foolish, dissolute young man.         250"
589,_CLINIA._,Evil communications corrupt good manners.
590,_CLINIA._,
591,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ Clinia is not that sort at all.
592,_CLINIA._,
593,_CLINIA._,_Chr._                             You do not know.
594,_CLINIA._,
595,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._ I know he fell in love with a girl that lives in the town,"
596,_CLINIA._,"And wanted to marry her, only his father would not hear of it,"
597,_CLINIA._,"And sent him off to Asia, and now—"
598,_CLINIA._,
599,_CLINIA._,_Chr._                         He ran away.
600,_CLINIA._,
601,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._ And if he did, no wonder, considering his father’s"
602,_CLINIA._,treatment.
603,_CLINIA._,
604,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ He should not have done so.
605,_CLINIA._,
606,_CLINIA._,_Pam._              I take it his father’s sorry now.
607,_CLINIA._,
608,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ Of course all parents are always sorry for their sons’
609,_CLINIA._,misconduct.
610,_CLINIA._,
611,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ But he has far more cause to be sorry now for his own.
612,_CLINIA._,
613,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ You think so?
614,_CLINIA._,
615,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._            Yes, I do."
616,_CLINIA._,
617,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ (_aside_).         I must not let my son                  260
618,_CLINIA._,Know how this old man dotes. If he should think all fathers
619,_CLINIA._,"As soft as poor Menedemus, pretty pranks he’d play me!"
620,_CLINIA._,
621,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ What were you saying?
622,_CLINIA._,
623,_CLINIA._,_Chr._         Ha! I’ll tell you what I was saying;
624,_CLINIA._,That in any case his duty was to have stayed at home.
625,_CLINIA._,’Tis possible that his father was somewhat more severe
626,_CLINIA._,Than he found pleasant; but still he should have put up with it.
627,_CLINIA._,"For whom sh^d a lad submit to, if not to his own father?"
628,_CLINIA._,"Ought his father, tell me, to have fallen in with him,"
629,_CLINIA._,Or he with his father? And then what he is pleased to call
630,_CLINIA._,"A hardship, was nothing of the kind: the so-called severities      270"
631,_CLINIA._,Of fathers are much of a piece: the least strict do not like
632,_CLINIA._,"To see their sons continually in bad company,"
633,_CLINIA._,Continually drinking: and so they are sparing in what they allow them;
634,_CLINIA._,"For such restrictions, remember, promote good morals."
635,_CLINIA._,But when a man’s mind has once become the slave
636,_CLINIA._,"Of evil passions, he is driven of necessity from bad to worse."
637,_CLINIA._,"There’s wisdom, Pamphilus, in the saying, _By others’ faults"
638,_CLINIA._,Wise men correct their own._
639,_CLINIA._,
640,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                 I think so too.
641,_CLINIA._,
642,_CLINIA._,_Chr._                             Very well.
643,_CLINIA._,Then I need say no more.
644,_CLINIA._,
645,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                 Would not the old man, sir,"
646,_CLINIA._,Be glad to see him back?
647,_CLINIA._,
648,_CLINIA._,_Chr._             He would be glad to see him
649,_CLINIA._,Return from his evil ways to a dutiful course of conduct.        281
650,_CLINIA._,
651,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ I guess he’d let him marry the girl.
652,_CLINIA._,
653,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ (_aside_).                           What shall I say?
654,_CLINIA._,
655,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ He would.
656,_CLINIA._,
657,_CLINIA._,"_Chr._ Nay, Pamphilus: attend to me. No father"
658,_CLINIA._,Would ever give in to his son in a matter of this kind.
659,_CLINIA._,Learn this lesson: see what shame your friend has brought
660,_CLINIA._,"On his poor old father. No, ’twould never do to yield."
661,_CLINIA._,I can promise you too that he will not. I should not advise it myself.
662,_CLINIA._,
663,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._ You don’t know Clinia, sir; and have never seen the girl."
664,_CLINIA._,You go entirely by what this old Menedemus says.
665,_CLINIA._,He never saw her himself.
666,_CLINIA._,
667,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ (_aside_). That’s true.—And you have seen her?
668,_CLINIA._,
669,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ I have.
670,_CLINIA._,
671,_CLINIA._,_Chr._       And what is she like?
672,_CLINIA._,
673,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                         I never saw anything like her.
674,_CLINIA._,
675,_CLINIA._,"_Chr._ Come, what d’ye mean?"
676,_CLINIA._,
677,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._        I tell you, I know now what she’s like—"
678,_CLINIA._,The statue that stands in the hall: the third on the left.
679,_CLINIA._,
680,_CLINIA._,_Chr._                                      The Grace?
681,_CLINIA._,An elegant taste.
682,_CLINIA._,
683,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._     If you were to see her, you’d say the same."
684,_CLINIA._,
685,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ Should I? Then just attend. I wish to help my neighbour.
686,_CLINIA._,"If all were ready to lend their neighbours a helping hand,"
687,_CLINIA._,We should not hear the complaints we do against ill fortune.
688,_CLINIA._,I am always ready myself; am now: in point of fact
689,_CLINIA._,"I have promised to do what I can: but since, before I act,       299"
690,_CLINIA._,"Or even judge, I am willing to know all sides of a case,"
691,_CLINIA._,’Tis part of my duty to see this girl. Could you procure
692,_CLINIA._,That I should speak with her?
693,_CLINIA._,
694,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ (_aside_).          This is the very thing we want.
695,_CLINIA._,"If now I could get him to ask Antiphila here to-day,"
696,_CLINIA._,Clinia of course would come: I’ll try and work it.
697,_CLINIA._,
698,_CLINIA._,_Chr._                                       Well?
699,_CLINIA._,Answer me. Could you do this?
700,_CLINIA._,
701,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                  Yes, father."
702,_CLINIA._,
703,_CLINIA._,_Chr._                               When?
704,_CLINIA._,
705,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                                     To-day.
706,_CLINIA._,
707,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ I did not mean to-day.
708,_CLINIA._,
709,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                  There’s no time like the present.
710,_CLINIA._,
711,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ For inconvenience?
712,_CLINIA._,
713,_CLINIA._,_Pam._              No; for opportunity.
714,_CLINIA._,
715,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ How so?
716,_CLINIA._,
717,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._   Invite her here to spend the feast with us,"
718,_CLINIA._,And bring a friend.
719,_CLINIA._,
720,_CLINIA._,_Chr._        But would she come?
721,_CLINIA._,
722,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                            Yes, she would come."
723,_CLINIA._,
724,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ Whom have you asked besides?
725,_CLINIA._,
726,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                        Only Philolaches.
727,_CLINIA._,
728,_CLINIA._,"_Chr._ It happens, Pamphilus, we are short of guests; I find      311"
729,_CLINIA._,My old friend Phanias has gone from home to-day.
730,_CLINIA._,Archonides’ wife is ill; they cannot come: and now
731,_CLINIA._,Just the last thing Daniel has disappointed me.
732,_CLINIA._,The two young ladies would help us out: besides I am sure
733,_CLINIA._,’Twould please your mother to ask them.
734,_CLINIA._,
735,_CLINIA._,_Pam._                            I cannot agree with you there.
736,_CLINIA._,
737,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ Allow me to judge of that; and since you said you were able
738,_CLINIA._,To bring them—bring them.
739,_CLINIA._,
740,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._               Oh, if you wish it, I’m ready enough;"
741,_CLINIA._,I’ll see they come: but I had forgotten; there is one more
742,_CLINIA._,Besides Philolaches.
743,_CLINIA._,
744,_CLINIA._,_Chr._         Who then? I beg you’ll bring                      320
745,_CLINIA._,None of your Clinias here.
746,_CLINIA._,
747,_CLINIA._,_Pam._               He that is with me now.
748,_CLINIA._,
749,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ He is it? That’s quite another thing: A gentleman
750,_CLINIA._,"At first sight, Pamphilus; I wish that all your friends"
751,_CLINIA._,Were such as he. By all means bring him. Present him now.
752,_CLINIA._,His name?
753,_CLINIA._,
754,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ Clitipho.
755,_CLINIA._,
756,_CLINIA._,_Chr._ (_aside_). I like his appearance much:
757,_CLINIA._,When I came up he went respectfully aside—
758,_CLINIA._,"Excellent manners. (_To Clin._) Ha, good Clitipho, how d’ye do?"
759,_CLINIA._,’Tis time that we were acquainted. I understand my son
760,_CLINIA._,"Has invited you to our house. There’s not much I can offer,      329"
761,_CLINIA._,But _My little pot is soon hot_. I am very glad
762,_CLINIA._,And proud to have you my guest.
763,_CLINIA._,
764,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._              I thank you, sir; I am sorry—"
765,_CLINIA._,
766,_CLINIA._,"_Chr._ No thanks, I pray. At present excuse me; for I must go"
767,_CLINIA._,And prepare my wife to receive her guests. You’re sure
768,_CLINIA._,they’ll come?
769,_CLINIA._,
770,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ Sure.
771,_CLINIA._,
772,_CLINIA._,_Chr._       And I hope they may. ’Twill make our numbers up:
773,_CLINIA._,We’ll have a merry feast.
774,_CLINIA._,
775,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._             Ay, sir....               [_Exit Chremes within._"
776,_CLINIA._,"And so we shall,"
777,_CLINIA._,Clinia.
778,_CLINIA._,
779,_CLINIA._,_Clin._ What have you done?
780,_CLINIA._,
781,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                Why pretty well, I think."
782,_CLINIA._,
783,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._ I did not look for this, nor wish it, and do not like it."
784,_CLINIA._,
785,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ Not like it! Is it not perfect? If all the gods in heaven
786,_CLINIA._,"Had put their heads together to assist in your affairs,"
787,_CLINIA._,They could not have done it better than I. My father bids        340
788,_CLINIA._,"You and Antiphila both to spend the day; and he,"
789,_CLINIA._,"Charmed with her grace and beauty, will use his influence"
790,_CLINIA._,To bring your father round.
791,_CLINIA._,
792,_CLINIA._,_Clin._               I would not risk so much
793,_CLINIA._,On the fancy of any man: and though I have a hope
794,_CLINIA._,"Antiphila’s charms will plead not vainly, that must be"
795,_CLINIA._,"When she’s my wife, not now: and they must urge themselves;"
796,_CLINIA._,Another cannot paint them.
797,_CLINIA._,
798,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._               I do beseech you, Clinia,"
799,_CLINIA._,"Don’t leave a friend in the lurch. Hark you; to tell the truth,"
800,_CLINIA._,My scheme suits me to a T as well as you. My father
801,_CLINIA._,Expects Antiphila to bring a companion with her:
802,_CLINIA._,"Now I have a lady friend, with whom I am circumstanced           351"
803,_CLINIA._,"Much as you are with yours. My father, just as yours,"
804,_CLINIA._,Would never hear of my asking her home; but if she comes
805,_CLINIA._,"To-day as Antiphila’s friend, he’ll not guess who she is;"
806,_CLINIA._,"So you may have your love to yourself, & I have mine."
807,_CLINIA._,"And see, here comes Philolaches, our other guest:"
808,_CLINIA._,I’ll tell him what is arranged: he’ll be a strong ally.
809,_CLINIA._,
810,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._ Indeed, I can’t consent: and who is Philolaches,"
811,_CLINIA._,That you sh^d wish to tell him all my private affairs?
812,_CLINIA._,
813,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._ Ah, he can smell a rat; but don’t be afraid of him;       360"
814,_CLINIA._,"He’s my sworn friend: & sure no less to keep a secret,"
815,_CLINIA._,Than he is to find out anything in the mortal world
816,_CLINIA._,That you seek to withhold.
817,_CLINIA._,
818,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._              I pray, say nothing to him of me."
819,_CLINIA._,
820,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ Trust us; we won’t betray you.
821,_CLINIA._,
822,_CLINIA._,(_Runs back to meet Phil._)
823,_CLINIA._,
824,_CLINIA._,_Clin._                          Pamphilus! why he’s gone.
825,_CLINIA._,Now save me from my friends! Indeed this Pamphilus
826,_CLINIA._,Will be my ruin: I wish to heaven I had never met him.
827,_CLINIA._,"He’ll tell his father next, this old Ionian huckster,"
828,_CLINIA._,"Sponge-mongering Chremes; the gods defend me from him,"
829,_CLINIA._,"And his family feast, and his prosy wisdom! I thought to spend"
830,_CLINIA._,This day of my return with sweet Antiphila:                      370
831,_CLINIA._,"And here I am, caught by the ears. And yet my troublesome friend"
832,_CLINIA._,Means well: I would not hurt his feelings; but at any cost
833,_CLINIA._,"I must get clear, and in one matter I cannot yield:"
834,_CLINIA._,I will not have Antiphila brought to the judgment-seat
835,_CLINIA._,Of this suburban oracle. What has he to do
836,_CLINIA._,"With me & mine, my father or her—to push his nose"
837,_CLINIA._,Into our affairs?
838,_CLINIA._,
839,_CLINIA._,_Re-enter Pamphilus with Philolaches._
840,_CLINIA._,
841,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._      Allow me, Clinia, here’s my friend"
842,_CLINIA._,"Philolaches, the actor. Philolaches, my friend"
843,_CLINIA._,"Clinia: who is, as I told you, in Persia, you understand."
844,_CLINIA._,He looks for some assurance of your discretion.
845,_CLINIA._,
846,_PHILOLACHES._,_PHILOLACHES._
847,_PHILOLACHES._,
848,_PHILOLACHES._,"Sir,             380"
849,_PHILOLACHES._,You have it. Take this hand. And by the dog I swear
850,_PHILOLACHES._,Not to divulge a tittle; in friendship’s secrecy
851,_PHILOLACHES._,Rather to aid—
852,_PHILOLACHES._,
853,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._   No need, sir: I take the will for the deed."
854,_PHILOLACHES._,"My business is my own, and not of such a kind"
855,_PHILOLACHES._,As another can help in.
856,_PHILOLACHES._,
857,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._            Oh, but he can."
858,_PHILOLACHES._,
859,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                             A family quarrel—
860,_PHILOLACHES._,"Meddling of course resented. But while your father, sir,"
861,_PHILOLACHES._,"Treats you so ill, expels you his house, denies his ear"
862,_PHILOLACHES._,To the pitiful plea—
863,_PHILOLACHES._,
864,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._         Excuse me again. I do not know
865,_PHILOLACHES._,That my father is ill-disposed.
866,_PHILOLACHES._,
867,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ (_to Pam._).              You told me.
868,_PHILOLACHES._,
869,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                                 I said he _was_;
870,_PHILOLACHES._,But Clinia hopes he may now be changed.
871,_PHILOLACHES._,
872,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                             If that’s the case,            390"
873,_PHILOLACHES._,"I see that your wish must be, that I sh^d discover at once"
874,_PHILOLACHES._,Your father’s temper towards you.
875,_PHILOLACHES._,
876,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._                     Indeed, sir, I do not wish it."
877,_PHILOLACHES._,
878,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ I die to serve you.
879,_PHILOLACHES._,
880,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._             I thank you.
881,_PHILOLACHES._,
882,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                            I promise to find it out
883,_PHILOLACHES._,In half an hour.
884,_PHILOLACHES._,
885,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._    How would you?
886,_PHILOLACHES._,
887,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                     I am an actor, sir;"
888,_PHILOLACHES._,Never so much myself as when I seem another.
889,_PHILOLACHES._,Would you employ my talent—
890,_PHILOLACHES._,
891,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._                Why, what would you do?"
892,_PHILOLACHES._,
893,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._ Disguise myself as a Persian, late arrived in Athens:"
894,_PHILOLACHES._,Go to your father’s house & bring him tidings of you.
895,_PHILOLACHES._,How the old man took what I should tell him would teach you all.
896,_PHILOLACHES._,"Nay, I can promise more; that, if there’s left in him"
897,_PHILOLACHES._,"The last wandering spark of affection, I’ll blow it to flame,      401"
898,_PHILOLACHES._,And you shall twist him round your thumb.
899,_PHILOLACHES._,
900,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                              Bravo!
901,_PHILOLACHES._,
902,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._                                    But, sir,"
903,_PHILOLACHES._,What tidings would you feign?
904,_PHILOLACHES._,
905,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                   That is as I should find him:
906,_PHILOLACHES._,"If soft, I’d handle him kindly: if hard, I’d say I’d seen you"
907,_PHILOLACHES._,"Sick of a fever, enslaved, imprisoned, or, if required,"
908,_PHILOLACHES._,Dead and buried.
909,_PHILOLACHES._,
910,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._    And so you would give him needless pain.
911,_PHILOLACHES._,
912,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._ That is the question, Clinia; if you were sure of that,"
913,_PHILOLACHES._,You would not be hiding.
914,_PHILOLACHES._,
915,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._            Nay, but the doubt will not excuse me"
916,_PHILOLACHES._,"In doing the thing, which I still must hope would pain him most."
917,_PHILOLACHES._,
918,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._ What matter, when all the time you are just behind"
919,_PHILOLACHES._,the hedge?                                                     410
920,_PHILOLACHES._,No reason I see to wound him: I shall feel my way.
921,_PHILOLACHES._,"An hour will settle all. If he be kindly bent,"
922,_PHILOLACHES._,"Or I can move him towards you, you must stand prepared"
923,_PHILOLACHES._,"To strike while the iron is hot. The lady, I understand,"
924,_PHILOLACHES._,"Will be with you here: be ready, and when I give the word,"
925,_PHILOLACHES._,You step across the road and kneel for the old man’s blessing.
926,_PHILOLACHES._,
927,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._ I have told you, Pamphilus, Antiphila must not come."
928,_PHILOLACHES._,Your father’s interference is most unfortunate:
929,_PHILOLACHES._,He is not my judge for good or ill. It shall not be.
930,_PHILOLACHES._,
931,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._ I have promised.
932,_PHILOLACHES._,
933,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._           I am determined.
934,_PHILOLACHES._,
935,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                              A very delicate point.        420
936,_PHILOLACHES._,And yet ’tis a pity they should not come.
937,_PHILOLACHES._,
938,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._                              O Clinia,"
939,_PHILOLACHES._,Your obstinacy will ruin all.
940,_PHILOLACHES._,
941,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ (_to Pam._).            I understand.
942,_PHILOLACHES._,"Your friend objects to the lady coming, because he thinks"
943,_PHILOLACHES._,Your father will know her?
944,_PHILOLACHES._,
945,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._               And so he will.
946,_PHILOLACHES._,
947,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                                Nay, not at all."
948,_PHILOLACHES._,Chremes need never know her.
949,_PHILOLACHES._,
950,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                 How can you manage that?
951,_PHILOLACHES._,
952,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ The thing’s as easy as lying. Let the ladies change
953,_PHILOLACHES._,"Their names; or if so be Chremes knows not their names,"
954,_PHILOLACHES._,"Let them but change their parts. Gorgo—for that’s the lady,      428"
955,_PHILOLACHES._,"Whom you would bring, I guess—let Gorgo pass to-day"
956,_PHILOLACHES._,For Clinia’s mistress; let Antiphila play the maid;
957,_PHILOLACHES._,"W^h hinders not that when they come, each take his own."
958,_PHILOLACHES._,"You have your Gorgo; you, sir, your Antiphila:"
959,_PHILOLACHES._,And none will be any the wiser.
960,_PHILOLACHES._,
961,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                    Good. What say you now?
962,_PHILOLACHES._,
963,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._ ’Twould make all kinds of complications, Pamphilus:"
964,_PHILOLACHES._,And all to no manner of purpose.
965,_PHILOLACHES._,
966,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._                     Why, I should keep my promise,"
967,_PHILOLACHES._,And spend the day with Gorgo.
968,_PHILOLACHES._,
969,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._                 I’ll play no part in this.
970,_PHILOLACHES._,You quite forget besides that as yet I know not how
971,_PHILOLACHES._,Antiphila will receive me. I have been six months away;
972,_PHILOLACHES._,"She may have thrown me over, may have another lover,"
973,_PHILOLACHES._,And think of me no more.
974,_PHILOLACHES._,
975,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._              Wish you to find out that?                    440
976,_PHILOLACHES._,I’ll serve you too in this. Give me the word to go
977,_PHILOLACHES._,"And visit her where she lives, and if I find her true,"
978,_PHILOLACHES._,To bring her along at once.
979,_PHILOLACHES._,
980,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._               ’Tis extremely kind of you, sir,"
981,_PHILOLACHES._,To throw yourself so quickly and hotly into my affairs:
982,_PHILOLACHES._,But indeed I do not need it.
983,_PHILOLACHES._,
984,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                  ’Tis plain to me you do.
985,_PHILOLACHES._,"A runaway just returned, afraid to face his father,"
986,_PHILOLACHES._,Fearful lest in his absence his mistress have proved untrue—
987,_PHILOLACHES._,"Not need a friend? Why a friend is just what you do need,"
988,_PHILOLACHES._,"To discover for you the state of affairs, and put you in train."
989,_PHILOLACHES._,
990,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._ Though, sir, I were quite content to reckon upon"
991,_PHILOLACHES._,"your zeal,                                                    450"
992,_PHILOLACHES._,Maybe you overrate your ability.
993,_PHILOLACHES._,
994,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                      Not at all.
995,_PHILOLACHES._,Unless you will say that by art I am able to counterfeit
996,_PHILOLACHES._,"Passion in all its branches, & yet not know the thing"
997,_PHILOLACHES._,When I see it;—as if a man c^d write who cannot read.
998,_PHILOLACHES._,You think your love for this lady a secret between yourselves—
999,_PHILOLACHES._,"That she would not reveal it to me, a stranger? How in the world"
1000,_PHILOLACHES._,"Could she conceal it? Why, don’t you know that a girl in love"
1001,_PHILOLACHES._,Is _A B C_ to read? Trust me and let me try.
1002,_PHILOLACHES._,
1003,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._ Clinia, do yield, I pray."
1004,_PHILOLACHES._,
1005,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._                    I know not what to do.
1006,_PHILOLACHES._,I’ll yield so far as this: that if Philolaches                   460
1007,_PHILOLACHES._,"Can, as he boasts, discover these two things for me, first"
1008,_PHILOLACHES._,"How my father stands disposed to me now, and next"
1009,_PHILOLACHES._,Whether Antiphila’s heart is firm—and this so soon
1010,_PHILOLACHES._,And easily as he thinks—I would not hinder him.
1011,_PHILOLACHES._,One stipulation only: let him name what time
1012,_PHILOLACHES._,"Will cover the whole performance; for failing him, I’d like"
1013,_PHILOLACHES._,"To take my affairs in hand myself. I’ll ask him then,"
1014,_PHILOLACHES._,When does he hope to do this?
1015,_PHILOLACHES._,
1016,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                   Give me an hour apiece.
1017,_PHILOLACHES._,
1018,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._ This afternoon.
1019,_PHILOLACHES._,
1020,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._             Enough: a bargain. ’Tis two hearts
1021,_PHILOLACHES._,To read—your father and mistress.
1022,_PHILOLACHES._,
1023,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._                      And both this afternoon.            470
1024,_PHILOLACHES._,
1025,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._ And bring the lady if she is true.
1026,_PHILOLACHES._,
1027,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._                             I said not that.
1028,_PHILOLACHES._,
1029,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._ Clinia, you must."
1030,_PHILOLACHES._,
1031,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._              Agree to this: I first will go
1032,_PHILOLACHES._,"And visit Antiphila; if she is willing, I bring her here,"
1033,_PHILOLACHES._,"And here you may meet. But since she comes as Gorgo’s maid,"
1034,_PHILOLACHES._,"’Twill be easy for you to withdraw with her, where and"
1035,_PHILOLACHES._,when you choose:
1036,_PHILOLACHES._,I meanwhile will angle your father.
1037,_PHILOLACHES._,
1038,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._ (_to Pam._).                Then thus I assent,"
1039,_PHILOLACHES._,"That first, she is not introduced to your father; and secondly,"
1040,_PHILOLACHES._,That I may take her away when I choose.
1041,_PHILOLACHES._,
1042,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                            Agreed.
1043,_PHILOLACHES._,
1044,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                                     I’m off.
1045,_PHILOLACHES._,But first a word with you (_to Pam._).
1046,_PHILOLACHES._,
1047,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._ (_to Clin._).                   O Clinia, I do thank you."
1048,_PHILOLACHES._,But don’t stay out here longer: somebody is sure to see you.      480
1049,_PHILOLACHES._,Go into the house.
1050,_PHILOLACHES._,
1051,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._      If you will come with me.
1052,_PHILOLACHES._,
1053,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                                 I’ll come directly.
1054,_PHILOLACHES._,
1055,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._ I have never met your people. I can’t go in by myself.
1056,_PHILOLACHES._,
1057,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._ Why, man alive, there’s only my father and mother. Go in."
1058,_PHILOLACHES._,[_Exit Clinia within._
1059,_PHILOLACHES._,
1060,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ Your friend has money?
1061,_PHILOLACHES._,
1062,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._                 Yes, his father."
1063,_PHILOLACHES._,
1064,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                                   If I succeed,"
1065,_PHILOLACHES._,He’ll give me something?
1066,_PHILOLACHES._,
1067,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._             Surely. What are you going to do?
1068,_PHILOLACHES._,
1069,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ I’m going to dress myself up as a Persian—didn’t you hear?
1070,_PHILOLACHES._,To take in old Menedemus.
1071,_PHILOLACHES._,
1072,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._              May I help?
1073,_PHILOLACHES._,
1074,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                           Why, yes,"
1075,_PHILOLACHES._,"If you will do as I tell: you shall be Persian in chief,"
1076,_PHILOLACHES._,Swagger and talk the gibberish: I’ll be interpreter.
1077,_PHILOLACHES._,"Two are better than one, tho’ one be a tup’s head."
1078,_PHILOLACHES._,
1079,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._ Menedemus knows me by sight.
1080,_PHILOLACHES._,
1081,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                         Not in a Persian dress.            491
1082,_PHILOLACHES._,"Come, there’s no time to lose. I’ll go to the lady first:"
1083,_PHILOLACHES._,What is her name? Antiphila?
1084,_PHILOLACHES._,
1085,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                 Yes.
1086,_PHILOLACHES._,
1087,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                       And where does she live?
1088,_PHILOLACHES._,
1089,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._ I’ll come with you down the road, and tell you all as we go."
1090,_PHILOLACHES._,But let’s be off. I fear Clinia may change his mind.

1101,ACT · II,
1102,_PAMPHILUS._,_PAMPHILUS._
1103,_PAMPHILUS._,
1104,_PAMPHILUS._,What unjust judges fathers all are towards their children;
1105,_PAMPHILUS._,Pretending to us as they do that the moment we cease to be boys
1106,_PAMPHILUS._,"We ought to become thorough old men, without a trace"
1107,_PAMPHILUS._,Of the inclinations natural to our time of life:
1108,_PAMPHILUS._,"Governing us by the rule of their present appetites,"
1109,_PAMPHILUS._,"And not by those they have lost. If ever I have a son,"
1110,_PAMPHILUS._,"He will find me an easy father, able to understand"
1111,_PAMPHILUS._,"His faults, I hope, and ready to make allowance for them:"
1112,_PAMPHILUS._,"Not like mine, suspicious & cross—& he never speaks"
1113,_PAMPHILUS._,"But to read me a lecture on somebody else. Why, bless my soul,"
1114,_PAMPHILUS._,"If he has but taken an extra glass or two, the tales"
1115,_PAMPHILUS._,"Of his own wickedness he’ll come out with! And then he says,"
1116,_PAMPHILUS._,_By others’ faults wise men correct their own._ What wisdom!
1117,_PAMPHILUS._,He little thinks how deaf an adder he is trying to charm.
1118,_PAMPHILUS._,"At present the words of my mistress touch me nearer far,         510"
1119,_PAMPHILUS._,"When she says, Give me this, or, Bring me that; and I"
1120,_PAMPHILUS._,Have nothing to answer. Nobody could be in a worse plight.
1121,_PAMPHILUS._,"This fellow Clinia here has his hands full, yet his mistress"
1122,_PAMPHILUS._,"Is modest & well brought up, too gentle & innocent"
1123,_PAMPHILUS._,"To trifle with affection. Mine is a fine lady, exacting,"
1124,_PAMPHILUS._,"Vain, fashionable & extravagant; & I lack the means"
1125,_PAMPHILUS._,To please her fancy. This misfortune is new to me—
1126,_PAMPHILUS._,"An experience, which I have only just begun to learn:"
1127,_PAMPHILUS._,And as yet my father guesses nothing of it.
1128,_PAMPHILUS._,
1129,_PAMPHILUS._,_Enter Clinia._
1130,_PAMPHILUS._,
1131,_CLINIA._,_CLINIA._
1132,_CLINIA._,
1133,_CLINIA._,"If all were well,"
1134,_CLINIA._,They must have been here before: I fear there’s something
1135,_CLINIA._,"happened,                                                    520"
1136,_CLINIA._,Or that in my absence she may have become estranged from me.
1137,_CLINIA._,
1138,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._ What now, man?"
1139,_CLINIA._,
1140,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._         O, I am most unhappy."
1141,_CLINIA._,
1142,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                                You had best take care,"
1143,_CLINIA._,Or some one coming out of your father’s house may see you.
1144,_CLINIA._,
1145,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._ I will; but, Pamphilus, I have a strong presentiment"
1146,_CLINIA._,"Of some misfortune, I know not what."
1147,_CLINIA._,
1148,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                         Why, what’s the matter?"
1149,_CLINIA._,
1150,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._ Were nothing the matter, they certainly would have been"
1151,_CLINIA._,here by this.
1152,_CLINIA._,
1153,_CLINIA._,_Pam._ Nonsense. Doesn’t it strike you it’s some way off? and then
1154,_CLINIA._,"You know how it is with women, they are always about a year"
1155,_CLINIA._,Putting on their things and getting themselves up.
1156,_CLINIA._,
1157,_CLINIA._,_Clin._ But only fancy if really she should have forgotten me!      530
1158,_CLINIA._,"Yes,—while like a fool I ran away from home,"
1159,_CLINIA._,"And wandered I know not where, fall’n in deep disgrace,"
1160,_CLINIA._,"Undutiful to my father, for whom I am now sorry"
1161,_CLINIA._,"And ashamed of my conduct towards him;—thou, yes, O thou hast"
1162,_CLINIA._,"Deserted me, my Antiphila. What shall I do?"
1163,_CLINIA._,
1164,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._                                Look, look!"
1165,_CLINIA._,I see them coming.
1166,_CLINIA._,
1167,_CLINIA._,_Clin._      Where?
1168,_CLINIA._,
1169,_CLINIA._,"_Pam._              Well, here’s Philolaches,"
1170,_CLINIA._,"Who comes to announce them, (_aside_) and on his shoulders a"
1171,_CLINIA._,mighty bale
1172,_CLINIA._,Of Persian togs.
1173,_CLINIA._,
1174,_CLINIA._,_Enter Philolaches with a large bundle._
1175,_CLINIA._,
1176,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._    He has come without them! (_To Phil._) Tell me, sir,"
1177,_CLINIA._,Do the ladies come?
1178,_CLINIA._,
1179,_PHILOLACHES._,_PHILOLACHES._
1180,_PHILOLACHES._,
1181,_PHILOLACHES._,"They follow; I come before,"
1182,_PHILOLACHES._,Because there’s not a woman in Athens would walk with me         540
1183,_PHILOLACHES._,Carrying such a bundle along the public streets.
1184,_PHILOLACHES._,I was almost ashamed of myself.      (_Sets bundle down._)
1185,_PHILOLACHES._,
1186,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._                   But does she know I am here?
1187,_PHILOLACHES._,
1188,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ Or else had never come.
1189,_PHILOLACHES._,
1190,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._                 You have actually seen her then?
1191,_PHILOLACHES._,
1192,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._ I’ll tell you all I saw. The business was, I think,"
1193,_PHILOLACHES._,To discover if she was true?
1194,_PHILOLACHES._,
1195,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._                It was. Indeed I feared—
1196,_PHILOLACHES._,
1197,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ Then I have discovered it for you.
1198,_PHILOLACHES._,
1199,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._                            If you have really done so,"
1200,_PHILOLACHES._,Tell me your news at once.
1201,_PHILOLACHES._,
1202,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                Attend. When first I came
1203,_PHILOLACHES._,"To the house, I knocked. Out came an old woman and opened the door;"
1204,_PHILOLACHES._,I struck past her into the room. Of all the ways
1205,_PHILOLACHES._,"Of finding out how she has been living all these months,         550"
1206,_PHILOLACHES._,This suddenly breaking in on her was the best: this gave me
1207,_PHILOLACHES._,A pretty good guess at her usual way of spending the time:
1208,_PHILOLACHES._,There’s nothing like it for showing what people really are.
1209,_PHILOLACHES._,"I came upon her hard at work at her tapestry,"
1210,_PHILOLACHES._,Dressed in a common gown: no gold about her; none
1211,_PHILOLACHES._,"Of the rouge and powder, that women bedaub their faces with:"
1212,_PHILOLACHES._,She was dressed like those who dress for themselves: her hair
1213,_PHILOLACHES._,was loose
1214,_PHILOLACHES._,And pushed back carelessly from her face—
1215,_PHILOLACHES._,
1216,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._                              Go on, I pray."
1217,_PHILOLACHES._,
1218,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ The old woman was spinning the woof: one servant girl
1219,_PHILOLACHES._,besides                                                      559
1220,_PHILOLACHES._,"Wove with her, quite in rags, untidy and dirty."
1221,_PHILOLACHES._,
1222,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._                                    Now,"
1223,_PHILOLACHES._,"If this is true, I see you are safe. You would not find"
1224,_PHILOLACHES._,"The servant a slattern, where there’s a lover."
1225,_PHILOLACHES._,
1226,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._                                  Pray go on.
1227,_PHILOLACHES._,
1228,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._ When I told her that you were returned, and had sent for her."
1229,_PHILOLACHES._,She suddenly stopped in her work; the tears ran down her cheeks
1230,_PHILOLACHES._,"In such a way, it was easy to see ’twas for love of you.—"
1231,_PHILOLACHES._,
1232,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Clin._ Perdition take me now, if I know where I am for joy."
1233,_PHILOLACHES._,I was so afraid.
1234,_PHILOLACHES._,
1235,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._     And Gorgo is coming?
1236,_PHILOLACHES._,
1237,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                           Ay, no fear."
1238,_PHILOLACHES._,But don’t forget who’s who.
1239,_PHILOLACHES._,
1240,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                And have you taught the ladies
1241,_PHILOLACHES._,Their parts?
1242,_PHILOLACHES._,
1243,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ Antiphila’s part is nothing to learn at all;
1244,_PHILOLACHES._,Except she must not call your friend by his right name:
1245,_PHILOLACHES._,But Gorgo—
1246,_PHILOLACHES._,
1247,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._      What?
1248,_PHILOLACHES._,
1249,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._       Why she was hard to persuade, but once"
1250,_PHILOLACHES._,"Persuaded, I do not fear her. I am more afraid of you;"
1251,_PHILOLACHES._,"Don’t you forget that she doesn’t belong to you, mind!"
1252,_PHILOLACHES._,The slip                                                     573
1253,_PHILOLACHES._,Of a word might ruin all. And don’t make signs.
1254,_PHILOLACHES._,
1255,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                                    Trust me.
1256,_PHILOLACHES._,See here they come.
1257,_PHILOLACHES._,
1258,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._       I see them.
1259,_PHILOLACHES._,
1260,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                     Stay; let us stand aside;
1261,_PHILOLACHES._,And watch them till they see us.
1262,_PHILOLACHES._,
1263,_PHILOLACHES._,_Clin._                    Why now?
1264,_PHILOLACHES._,
1265,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                               I say, stand back."
1266,_PHILOLACHES._,
1267,_PHILOLACHES._,(_They retire._)
1268,_PHILOLACHES._,
1269,_PHILOLACHES._,_Enter Gorgo and Antiphila._
1270,_PHILOLACHES._,
1271,_GORGO._,_GORGO._
1272,_GORGO._,
1273,_GORGO._,"Upon my word, my dear Antiphila, I do praise"
1274,_GORGO._,"And envy you too, when I see how all your study has been"
1275,_GORGO._,To make your mind as charming and sweet as your face. Lord love
1276,_GORGO._,you!                                                          579
1277,_GORGO._,I’m not surprised at any one wanting to marry you.
1278,_GORGO._,I see from what you’ve said what kind of person you are;
1279,_GORGO._,"And when I come to think of the sort of life, which you"
1280,_GORGO._,"And people like you, lead, who keep admirers off"
1281,_GORGO._,"At arms’-length, then no wonder, I say, that you sh^d be"
1282,_GORGO._,"Just what you are, and others, like me, so different."
1283,_GORGO._,Then once your mind made up to share and spend your days
1284,_GORGO._,"With the man whose disposition is most congenial to you,"
1285,_GORGO._,He never leaves you more: for mutual benefits
1286,_GORGO._,"Must bind you so closely, that no misfortune can ever come"
1287,_GORGO._,To cross your love.
1288,_GORGO._,
1289,_ANTIPHILA._,_ANTIPHILA._
1290,_ANTIPHILA._,
1291,_ANTIPHILA._,I cannot tell what others do;                590
1292,_ANTIPHILA._,"But I know I always have wished, and done my best, to find"
1293,_ANTIPHILA._,My happiness in what pleased him.
1294,_ANTIPHILA._,
1295,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Clin._ (_aside_).                Ah, my Antiphila,"
1296,_ANTIPHILA._,"And that is why I love you, why I am now returned."

1298,_ANTIPHILA._,_Gor._ Who is that young man who is standing to look at us?
1299,_ANTIPHILA._,
1300,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Ant._ Ah, hold me up!"
1301,_ANTIPHILA._,
1302,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Gor._           Why, what in the world’s the matter, my dear?"
1303,_ANTIPHILA._,
1304,_ANTIPHILA._,_Ant._ I shall die; I shall die.
1305,_ANTIPHILA._,
1306,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Gor._                     Do say, what is it astonishes you?"

1309,_ANTIPHILA._,
1310,_ANTIPHILA._,_Gor._                      See who?
1311,_ANTIPHILA._,
1312,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Clin._                              ’Tis I, my dearest."

1315,_ANTIPHILA._,
1316,_ANTIPHILA._,_Clin._                              Are you well?
1317,_ANTIPHILA._,
1318,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Ant._ Oh, I am glad you have come back safe."
1319,_ANTIPHILA._,
1320,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Clin._                                 Do I hold thee,"
1321,_ANTIPHILA._,"Antiphila, thou most desired of my heart!"
1322,_ANTIPHILA._,
1323,_ANTIPHILA._,_Ph._                               Take care.                   600

1325,_ANTIPHILA._,
1326,_ANTIPHILA._,(_Takes up the bundle._)
1327,_ANTIPHILA._,

1330,_CHREMES._,_CHREMES._
1331,_CHREMES._,
1332,_CHREMES._,I thought so; here you are.
1333,_CHREMES._,I heard your voices. I welcome you all. How very nice!
1334,_CHREMES._,"Now, Pamphilus, pray present me!"
1335,_CHREMES._,
1336,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._ (_presenting Gorgo_).     This is the lady, sir."
1337,_CHREMES._,"My father, miss."
1338,_CHREMES._,
1339,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ (_aside_). She is handsomely dressed. (_To Gorgo_) I am
1340,_CHREMES._,very proud
1341,_CHREMES._,To make your acquaintance. I hope the day may be fortunate.
1342,_CHREMES._,’Twas kind of you now to come.
1343,_CHREMES._,
1344,_CHREMES._,"_Gor._                   Why, bless your heart, old man,"
1345,_CHREMES._,I thank ye: but all the same I came to please myself.
1346,_CHREMES._,
1347,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ (_aside_). My word!
1348,_CHREMES._,
1349,_CHREMES._,_Pam._               And this is the lady she brings with her.
1350,_CHREMES._,
1351,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ (_to Antiphila_).                          Ah, good-day."
1352,_CHREMES._,"You are welcome, welcome all. Again, good Clitipho."
1353,_CHREMES._,"Philolaches, I think. Good-day to you, sir! My word!"
1354,_CHREMES._,What a gigantic bundle!
1355,_CHREMES._,
1356,_CHREMES._,_Ph._             Ay.
1357,_CHREMES._,
1358,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                What can it be?                            611
1359,_CHREMES._,
1360,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ The ladies’ cloaks and wraps.
1361,_CHREMES._,
1362,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                        Shame to load you thus!
1363,_CHREMES._,"You know the proverb, _The willing horse_. Pray set them down."
1364,_CHREMES._,I’ll send a servant to take them.
1365,_CHREMES._,
1366,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._                       Nay, ’tis the merest trifle."
1367,_CHREMES._,
1368,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ Why, yes: and I’ll call my wife: excuse me, ladies—a moment."
1369,_CHREMES._,"Sostrata, Sostrata!...                   [_Goes into house calling._"
1370,_CHREMES._,
1371,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._ (_to Ph._). Follow me quick: this way, before my"
1372,_CHREMES._,father is back.
1373,_CHREMES._,
1374,_CHREMES._,[_Exeunt Pam. and Phil. into house at back._
1375,_CHREMES._,
1376,_CHREMES._,_Clin._ You know why I am returned?
1377,_CHREMES._,
1378,_CHREMES._,"_Ant._                        Nay, you must tell me first"
1379,_CHREMES._,What made you go away.
1380,_CHREMES._,
1381,_CHREMES._,"_Clin._          I could not help it, love;"
1382,_CHREMES._,My father—
1383,_CHREMES._,
1384,_CHREMES._,"_Ant._      O, I know; but is he not kinder now?"
1385,_CHREMES._,
1386,_CHREMES._,"_Clin._ Nay, I’m afraid he is not."
1387,_CHREMES._,
1388,_CHREMES._,_Re-enter Chremes with servant._
1389,_CHREMES._,
1390,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._                       Ladies, my wife’s within.           620"
1391,_CHREMES._,She begs you’ll enter. Why! & where is Philolaches?
1392,_CHREMES._,"Clitipho, pray go in—no ceremony, sir—"
1393,_CHREMES._,And take this lady with you. I follow.
1394,_CHREMES._,
1395,_CHREMES._,"_Clin._                          I thank you, sir."
1396,_CHREMES._,
1397,_CHREMES._,[_Exeunt Clinia and Antiphila with servant within._
1398,_CHREMES._,
1399,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ (_to Gorgo_). With you I beg one word of explanation alone,"
1400,_CHREMES._,Ere we go in—one word—
1401,_CHREMES._,
1402,_CHREMES._,"_Gor._             I wait your pleasure, sir."
1403,_CHREMES._,
1404,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ I do not wish to seem to meddle in your affairs.
1405,_CHREMES._,
1406,_CHREMES._,_Gor._ No matter for that.
1407,_CHREMES._,
1408,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._               Believe me, that, if I interfere,"
1409,_CHREMES._,It is for your good.
1410,_CHREMES._,
1411,_CHREMES._,"_Gor._         I know, sir, and thank you very kindly."
1412,_CHREMES._,
1413,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ I broach the matter at once; my maxim has always been,"
1414,_CHREMES._,_Straight to the business._
1415,_CHREMES._,
1416,_CHREMES._,"_Gor._                Well, I don’t dislike you for that."
1417,_CHREMES._,
1418,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ Then am I not right in thinking you have never so much
1419,_CHREMES._,as met                                                       611
1420,_CHREMES._,Old Menedemus?
1421,_CHREMES._,
1422,_CHREMES._,_Gor._   No.
1423,_CHREMES._,
1424,_CHREMES._,_Chr._       You have not?
1425,_CHREMES._,
1426,_CHREMES._,_Gor._                     No.
1427,_CHREMES._,
1428,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                         Stay. Perhaps
1429,_CHREMES._,You don’t know who I mean.
1430,_CHREMES._,
1431,_CHREMES._,_Gor._               He’s whatdyecallem’s father.
1432,_CHREMES._,
1433,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ (_aside_). Whatdyecallem! well!—He is Clinia’s father; yes.
1434,_CHREMES._,
1435,_CHREMES._,_Gor._ What of him?
1436,_CHREMES._,
1437,_CHREMES._,_Chr._        Why ’tis thus. (_aside_) What was I going to say?
1438,_CHREMES._,
1439,_CHREMES._,"_Gor._ Go on, sir."
1440,_CHREMES._,
1441,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._       Ay, the long and the short of the matter is this."
1442,_CHREMES._,I know your story—let me see—do I know your name?
1443,_CHREMES._,
1444,_CHREMES._,_Gor._ Gorgo.
1445,_CHREMES._,
1446,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._        Ay, to be sure. Well, Gorgo, I know your story,"
1447,_CHREMES._,But do not charge on you the unhappy consequence
1448,_CHREMES._,"Of a rash attachment. No. Young men will be young men,           640"
1449,_CHREMES._,And women are—women; no blame to them. But the fact is this:
1450,_CHREMES._,"That being on intimate terms with Clinia’s family,"
1451,_CHREMES._,"I have been entrusted by them, as one unprejudiced,"
1452,_CHREMES._,"To enquire, to judge & advise, and, if I can, to find"
1453,_CHREMES._,"A _Modus vivendi_: you, Gorgo, of course are well aware"
1454,_CHREMES._,"That your lover, whose absence has had no doubt its effect on you—"
1455,_CHREMES._,"That Clinia’s running away from home, I say, was due"
1456,_CHREMES._,To his father’s disapproval of your attachment: that
1457,_CHREMES._,"Gave rise to disagreement; and Clinia, balancing"
1458,_CHREMES._,"’Twixt love & duty, fled from home, & is now abroad,"
1459,_CHREMES._,Madly risking his life in Asia. Why do you laugh?
1460,_CHREMES._,
1461,_CHREMES._,"_Gor._ Indeed, sir, I was not laughing."
1462,_CHREMES._,
1463,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                            The shock this gave his father
1464,_CHREMES._,Betrayed at last the affection he really bore his son:
1465,_CHREMES._,"It measures too the mischief—shows his purpose too,"
1466,_CHREMES._,"And strong determination. He sold his house in town,"
1467,_CHREMES._,"Retired from life & pleasure—bought a farm out here,"
1468,_CHREMES._,And works upon it from morning till night like a common drudge.
1469,_CHREMES._,There’s nothing to laugh at.
1470,_CHREMES._,
1471,_CHREMES._,"_Gor._                 Excuse me, sir, I was only thinking"
1472,_CHREMES._,Of something very ridiculous.
1473,_CHREMES._,
1474,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                  Attend. ’Tis you have caused
1475,_CHREMES._,This quarrel: you have alienated father and son.                 660
1476,_CHREMES._,"Not only that; but it lies with you, and you alone,"
1477,_CHREMES._,"That one is risking his life in wild & barbarous wars,"
1478,_CHREMES._,The other is taking leave of his senses as fast as he can.
1479,_CHREMES._,"Think of this happy family life thus broken up,"
1480,_CHREMES._,Which may be never renewed. Suppose that Clinia
1481,_CHREMES._,"Be slain in the wars, and his father brought by grief to his grave—"
1482,_CHREMES._,Should not this make you serious?
1483,_CHREMES._,
1484,_CHREMES._,_Gor._ He! he! he!
1485,_CHREMES._,
1486,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._       Your trifling manner, miss,"
1487,_CHREMES._,Causes me much distress.
1488,_CHREMES._,
1489,_CHREMES._,"_Gor._             I am very nervous, sir,"
1490,_CHREMES._,"Your solemn way of talking alarms me, and when alarmed,"
1491,_CHREMES._,I always laugh. He! he! he!
1492,_CHREMES._,
1493,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._                Well, try and contain yourself, I pray."
1494,_CHREMES._,I asked you here to my house the better to judge of you.      671
1495,_CHREMES._,
1496,_CHREMES._,_Gor._ Ha! ha! ha!
1497,_CHREMES._,
1498,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ Well, well, I see you are merry. I would not check your mirth,"
1499,_CHREMES._,And yet I cannot see what cause you have to laugh.
1500,_CHREMES._,Still ’tis a feast with us. I bade you join the feast:
1501,_CHREMES._,Be merry to-day.
1502,_CHREMES._,
1503,_CHREMES._,"_Gor._     Ha! ha! I will, sir."
1504,_CHREMES._,
1505,_CHREMES._,_Re-enter Pamphilus and Philolaches._
1506,_CHREMES._,
1507,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ (_aside_).            By luck, here’s Pamphilus—"
1508,_CHREMES._,"(_To Gor._) See, here is my son: go in: I’ll speak with you"
1509,_CHREMES._,soon again.
1510,_CHREMES._,
1511,_CHREMES._,_Gor._ What time do you dine?
1512,_CHREMES._,
1513,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                   At five.
1514,_CHREMES._,
1515,_CHREMES._,_Gor._                      Is the bath made hot?
1516,_CHREMES._,
1517,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ (_aside_).                 My word!
1518,_CHREMES._,What a woman!—I’ll call my wife to attend you within.
1519,_CHREMES._,
1520,_CHREMES._,_Gor._ I thank you. I’ll take the bath.
1521,_CHREMES._,
1522,_CHREMES._,(_Going indoors._)
1523,_CHREMES._,
1524,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ (_aside to Pam._). O Pamphilus, Pamphilus,"
1525,_CHREMES._,What have you done? Such a woman as this to dine in
1526,_CHREMES._,my house.                            [_Exit Chremes with Gorgo._
1527,_CHREMES._,
1528,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._ By jove, Philolaches; here’s a dilemma now:"
1529,_CHREMES._,I never thought of it.                                           682
1530,_CHREMES._,
1531,_CHREMES._,_Ph._               What?
1532,_CHREMES._,
1533,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._                 Why when, for Clinia’s sake,"
1534,_CHREMES._,"We changed the ladies, I quite forgot that I had described"
1535,_CHREMES._,Antiphila to my father. Gorgo will never do.
1536,_CHREMES._,
1537,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ Why not?
1538,_CHREMES._,
1539,_CHREMES._,_Pam._   Don’t ask. What is to be done? What shall I say?
1540,_CHREMES._,
1541,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ I’m thinking.
1542,_CHREMES._,
1543,_CHREMES._,_Pam._        My father must never know who Gorgo is.
1544,_CHREMES._,
1545,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ I see.
1546,_CHREMES._,
1547,_CHREMES._,_Pam._       What can I tell him?
1548,_CHREMES._,
1549,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                       I’m thinking.
1550,_CHREMES._,
1551,_CHREMES._,_Pam._                                    He must not know.
1552,_CHREMES._,
1553,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ Do let me think.
1554,_CHREMES._,
1555,_CHREMES._,_Pam._           What is to be done? What can I say?
1556,_CHREMES._,
1557,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ I have it.
1558,_CHREMES._,
1559,_CHREMES._,_Pam._     What is it?
1560,_CHREMES._,
1561,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                  If we can do it—
1562,_CHREMES._,
1563,_CHREMES._,_Pam._                                   What?
1564,_CHREMES._,
1565,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                                          Your father
1566,_CHREMES._,Must sooner or later come to learn the ladies were changed.      690
1567,_CHREMES._,
1568,_CHREMES._,_Pam._ To-morrow that will not matter when Gorgo is out of the way.
1569,_CHREMES._,To-day we must keep up the deception.
1570,_CHREMES._,
1571,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                           I see you must.
1572,_CHREMES._,
1573,_CHREMES._,_Pam._ How can I?
1574,_CHREMES._,
1575,_CHREMES._,_Ph._       What do you say if I can make your father
1576,_CHREMES._,Give Gorgo fifty pounds for being so much unlike
1577,_CHREMES._,The lady he thinks her to be?
1578,_CHREMES._,
1579,_CHREMES._,_Pam._                  Impossible.
1580,_CHREMES._,
1581,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._                               Nay, ’tis not."
1582,_CHREMES._,
1583,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._ Well, how?"
1584,_CHREMES._,
1585,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._       Why, when your father scolds, turn round upon him;"
1586,_CHREMES._,"Say you knew all along exactly what he would think,"
1587,_CHREMES._,And brought the lady here in the hope he’d see his way
1588,_CHREMES._,To helping old Menedemus out of his scrape.
1589,_CHREMES._,
1590,_CHREMES._,_Pam._                                And then?
1591,_CHREMES._,
1592,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._ Tell him to offer Gorgo forty or fifty pounds,"
1593,_CHREMES._,If she will renounce her claim on Clinia.
1594,_CHREMES._,
1595,_CHREMES._,_Pam._                              Fifty pounds!      701
1596,_CHREMES._,My father give fifty pounds!
1597,_CHREMES._,
1598,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._                  Why, don’t you wish he would?"
1599,_CHREMES._,
1600,_CHREMES._,_Pam._ And what’s the use of wishing?
1601,_CHREMES._,
1602,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                           Try him.
1603,_CHREMES._,
1604,_CHREMES._,_Pam._                                   I think you’re mad.
1605,_CHREMES._,
1606,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ Try it; I’ll help you out. See here he comes.
1607,_CHREMES._,
1608,_CHREMES._,_Re-enter Chremes._
1609,_CHREMES._,
1610,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                                         Good heavens!
1611,_CHREMES._,"Pamphilus, here’s a sample of manners and good breeding."
1612,_CHREMES._,How could you ever have thought of bringing that woman here?
1613,_CHREMES._,
1614,_CHREMES._,_Pam._ You said you wanted to see her: I thought you wished her
1615,_CHREMES._,to come.
1616,_CHREMES._,
1617,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ When, sir, I blamed your friend, you said I could not judge,"
1618,_CHREMES._,Not having seen the lady. Did I not rightly judge?
1619,_CHREMES._,
1620,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ (_aside_). Tell him you knew. Don’t stand there mum.
1621,_CHREMES._,
1622,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                                     I am quite ashamed.   710
1623,_CHREMES._,
1624,_CHREMES._,_Pam._ You see then what she is like?
1625,_CHREMES._,
1626,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                          Of course I see too well.
1627,_CHREMES._,
1628,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._ I knew, sir, all along exactly what you would think."
1629,_CHREMES._,
1630,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ (_aside_). That’s right.
1631,_CHREMES._,
1632,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                  And yet you brought her?
1633,_CHREMES._,
1634,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._                      You blame me, sir, too soon:"
1635,_CHREMES._,I have put within your reach the very thing you wished.
1636,_CHREMES._,
1637,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ How so?
1638,_CHREMES._,
1639,_CHREMES._,_Pam._ I thought you wished to help Menedemus out.
1640,_CHREMES._,
1641,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ I do.
1642,_CHREMES._,
1643,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._       Why then, ’tis easy."
1644,_CHREMES._,
1645,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ (_aside_).                Bravo!
1646,_CHREMES._,
1647,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                             What do you mean?
1648,_CHREMES._,
1649,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._ Why, sir, we are all agreed the match would never do;"
1650,_CHREMES._,Then why in the world not put a stopper on it at once?
1651,_CHREMES._,
1652,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ I don’t quite see your drift.
1653,_CHREMES._,
1654,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._                         Why, forty or fifty pound"
1655,_CHREMES._,Would settle the matter.
1656,_CHREMES._,
1657,_CHREMES._,_Chr._             How?
1658,_CHREMES._,
1659,_CHREMES._,_Pam._                  Just make the offer and see.
1660,_CHREMES._,
1661,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ What offer?
1662,_CHREMES._,
1663,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._        O, I see."
1664,_CHREMES._,
1665,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                 I don’t see.
1666,_CHREMES._,
1667,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                               Capital!      721
1668,_CHREMES._,
1669,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ I’m very dull, no doubt."
1670,_CHREMES._,
1671,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                     If ’twas my place to speak....
1672,_CHREMES._,
1673,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ I don’t forbid you, sir."
1674,_CHREMES._,
1675,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._                     Then, sir, I praise the scheme."
1676,_CHREMES._,
1677,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ What scheme?
1678,_CHREMES._,
1679,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._         I’ll wager my life he means, this lady here"
1680,_CHREMES._,"Has plenty of other lovers; offer her fifty pounds,"
1681,_CHREMES._,If she’ll renounce this one.
1682,_CHREMES._,
1683,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._                 Why, stuff! suppose she did."
1684,_CHREMES._,She might be off to-day and on again to-morrow:
1685,_CHREMES._,"Besides, against what Clinia’s worth in cash to her,"
1686,_CHREMES._,"A fifty pounds is nothing. (_To Pam._) If that is all you meant,"
1687,_CHREMES._,You’re a very clever fellow.
1688,_CHREMES._,
1689,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._                  No doubt there’s nothing in it,      730"

1691,_CHREMES._,
1692,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                      Would that bind?
1693,_CHREMES._,How can you think it?
1694,_CHREMES._,
1695,_CHREMES._,_Ph._           It might not be binding perhaps on her;
1696,_CHREMES._,And yet ’twould do the business. If it did not shock
1697,_CHREMES._,"Clinia’s love, as it must, ’twould kill his last pretence."
1698,_CHREMES._,How could he face his father armed with such a paper?
1699,_CHREMES._,"If you will help this old Menedemus, that’s the way—"
1700,_CHREMES._,
1701,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ I’ll tell Menedemus of this.
1702,_CHREMES._,
1703,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._                        If you would help him, father,"
1704,_CHREMES._,Spare him the pain. No doubt he’d give you back the money.
1705,_CHREMES._,
1706,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ I believe you there. I’d give six times the sum myself,"
1707,_CHREMES._,Were I in his place.

1709,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._          I’ve half a mind, if you are afraid,      740"
1710,_CHREMES._,To do it myself.
1711,_CHREMES._,
1712,_CHREMES._,_Chr._     I should not fear to advance the money.
1713,_CHREMES._,
1714,_CHREMES._,"_Ph._ A poor man might, but you, sir...."
1715,_CHREMES._,
1716,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                             I do not grudge the money.
1717,_CHREMES._,
1718,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ A gentleman can’t consider his pocket at every turn.
1719,_CHREMES._,
1720,_CHREMES._,_Pam._ I’m sure you can’t.
1721,_CHREMES._,
1722,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ Do you think that forty pounds would do it?
1723,_CHREMES._,
1724,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ Forty or fifty.
1725,_CHREMES._,
1726,_CHREMES._,_Chr._          Thirty?
1727,_CHREMES._,
1728,_CHREMES._,_Pam._                  Do it handsomely.
1729,_CHREMES._,You say you’d give six times the sum yourself.
1730,_CHREMES._,
1731,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                                   I would.
1732,_CHREMES._,"Ay, Pamphilus, fifty times."
1733,_CHREMES._,
1734,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                 Then don’t think twice about it.
1735,_CHREMES._,
1736,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ I do think twice.     (_Goes aside._)
1737,_CHREMES._,
1738,_CHREMES._,_Ph._              Will he do it or not?
1739,_CHREMES._,
1740,_CHREMES._,_Pam._                                   My lucky coin.
1741,_CHREMES._,
1742,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ Watch him.
1743,_CHREMES._,
1744,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._     Heads he does, & tails he doesn’t. Heads!"
1745,_CHREMES._,He does.
1746,_CHREMES._,
1747,_CHREMES._,_Ph._ And he will. Look at him.
1748,_CHREMES._,
1749,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ (_aside._)               Fifty pounds! A risk.      750
1750,_CHREMES._,No chance of profit; no: nor marketable return.
1751,_CHREMES._,"Yet might it save a thousand. Well saved, is like well spent;"
1752,_CHREMES._,"Ay, even though ’tis saved for another: besides I am sure"
1753,_CHREMES._,The money is safe enough. And now I have gone so far
1754,_CHREMES._,"To help Menedemus, I can’t draw back; while if I do it"
1755,_CHREMES._,I certainly win his esteem & thanks. ’Tis very true
1756,_CHREMES._,That a good turn done to a neighbour is done to oneself: one lives
1757,_CHREMES._,Within the circle of joy one goes to create! ’Tis wise:
1758,_CHREMES._,And then to have Menedemus my friend! Say forty pounds;      759
1759,_CHREMES._,"I happen to have it handy. I’ll do it. It shan’t be said,"
1760,_CHREMES._,"Chremes is not a gentleman. No, I’ll do it."
1761,_CHREMES._,
1762,_CHREMES._,"_Pam._                                Sir,"
1763,_CHREMES._,Have you decided?
1764,_CHREMES._,
1765,_CHREMES._,_Chr._      I have.
1766,_CHREMES._,
1767,_CHREMES._,_Ph._               You’ll do it?
1768,_CHREMES._,
1769,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                            I shall.
1770,_CHREMES._,
1771,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                                      Bravo!
1772,_CHREMES._,Will you give us the money now?
1773,_CHREMES._,
1774,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._                    You, sir!"
1775,_CHREMES._,
1776,_CHREMES._,_Ph._                               I mean to your son;
1777,_CHREMES._,To arrange with the lady.
1778,_CHREMES._,
1779,_CHREMES._,_Chr._              How so? You seem in a vast hurry.
1780,_CHREMES._,I manage my own affairs. Besides the forty pounds
1781,_CHREMES._,Is only a guess. I hope to win the lady for less.
1782,_CHREMES._,"Perhaps you thought that if I gave you the round sum,"
1783,_CHREMES._,"I should not enquire for the balance, and you might manage to save"
1784,_CHREMES._,A little commission. No: I manage my own affairs.
1785,_CHREMES._,You can’t take Chremes in as easily as all that.      770

1794,_CHREMES._,"You wanted a present for Gorgo, you told me. Won’t this do?"

1800,_CHREMES._,For after all we shan’t see much of this forty pound;

1816,_CHREMES._,"Suppose his son had returned, and he with his simple heart      780"

1820,_CHREMES._,As much as I should make on a small consignment of sponges:
1821,_CHREMES._,And that I have paid on risk—although I cannot doubt
1822,_CHREMES._,But that Menedemus will gladly pay me again—’tis risked.

1828,_CHREMES._,"To consider her promise of weight. Ah, mistress, giggle and all,"
1829,_CHREMES._,I’ve settled your hash. Ha! ha! ’twas clever of Pamphilus:
1830,_CHREMES._,"The lad has some of my wits. But still I shall be uneasy,"
1831,_CHREMES._,Until I find Menedemus is reasonable:—indeed

2285,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._         She is spending the day at my house.
2286,_MENEDEMUS._,"’Twas this I was coming to tell you about, but the"
2287,_MENEDEMUS._,other matter                                                 980
2288,_MENEDEMUS._,Had driven it out of my head. I thought to discover for you
2289,_MENEDEMUS._,(Seeing you did not know) what kind of person she was;
2290,_MENEDEMUS._,"That I might judge and tell you, whether you most were wrong"
2291,_MENEDEMUS._,"In being at first so harsh to your son, or now to yourself."
2292,_MENEDEMUS._,"So I asked her to spend the day at my house. It has ended in this,"
2293,_MENEDEMUS._,"That when I saw what kind of woman she really was,"
2294,_MENEDEMUS._,I offered her forty pounds if she would renounce your son.
2295,_MENEDEMUS._,"Believe me, she jumped at the bargain; so then, to prevent mistake,"
2296,_MENEDEMUS._,I made her sign a paper to that effect. I hold it.
2297,_MENEDEMUS._,"It cost me forty pounds; and that’s the money I said,"
2298,_MENEDEMUS._,That I had advanced for you.      991
2299,_MENEDEMUS._,
2300,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._                 ’Twas very kind of you, Chremes."
2301,_MENEDEMUS._,You see I am shocked.
2302,_MENEDEMUS._,
2303,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._          Nay, don’t give way."
2304,_MENEDEMUS._,
2305,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._                               You have dashed my hope.
2306,_MENEDEMUS._,I was not prepared for this. Freeborn I knew she was not;
2307,_MENEDEMUS._,But this I never suspected.
2308,_MENEDEMUS._,
2309,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                Come to my house and see.
2310,_MENEDEMUS._,I wish you to judge for yourself.
2311,_MENEDEMUS._,
2312,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._                      She is there?
2313,_MENEDEMUS._,
2314,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._                                    She is there, do you ask?"
2315,_MENEDEMUS._,"Ay, to my cost she is there. No sooner she comes to the door,"
2316,_MENEDEMUS._,Than all is to be topsy-turvy. She calls me ‘old man!’
2317,_MENEDEMUS._,"Asks if the bath is ready, and presently calls for wine."
2318,_MENEDEMUS._,"She’ll take a ‘whetting brusher,’ she says. The quantity"
2319,_MENEDEMUS._,She wasted in merely tasting was more than most men drink.      1000
2320,_MENEDEMUS._,"She kept me an hour on my legs before she was pleased, and then"
2321,_MENEDEMUS._,"Drank like a fish, & laughed at nothing & everything."
2322,_MENEDEMUS._,"Had it not been for you, Menedemus, I promise you"
2323,_MENEDEMUS._,I could not have stood it.
2324,_MENEDEMUS._,
2325,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._               I feel extremely obliged to you,"
2326,_MENEDEMUS._,And sorry for this. You have been most friendly in all you have done.
2327,_MENEDEMUS._,"I cannot doubt you are right. But still whatever she is,"
2328,_MENEDEMUS._,I’d like to see her once. I can’t dine with you;—arrange
2329,_MENEDEMUS._,To send her across to me. Explain to her who I am;
2330,_MENEDEMUS._,And let me judge for myself if it is so impossible
2331,_MENEDEMUS._,To carry out my former intention as you believe.
2332,_MENEDEMUS._,
2333,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ By all means. I shall be glad enough to be rid of her.      1011
2334,_MENEDEMUS._,I go at once.
2335,_MENEDEMUS._,
2336,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._        And find those Persians, whoever they are."
2337,_MENEDEMUS._,
2338,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ Indeed I must. For either I was grossly deceived
2339,_MENEDEMUS._,In a manner I cannot believe—I gave them money too—
2340,_MENEDEMUS._,Or else—
2341,_MENEDEMUS._,
2342,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Men._     Well, lose no time, I pray: I am less at ease"
2343,_MENEDEMUS._,"In the matter now, than when you told me first."
2344,_MENEDEMUS._,
2345,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                                    Indeed
2346,_MENEDEMUS._,I fear you have cause: I’ll go at once. Farewell.
2347,_MENEDEMUS._,
2348,_MENEDEMUS._,[_Exit._
2349,_MENEDEMUS._,
2350,_MENEDEMUS._,_Men._                                      Farewell.
2351,_MENEDEMUS._,A silly hoax no doubt. I wish ’twere half as likely
2352,_MENEDEMUS._,That Chremes was wrong about the girl. ’Tis very strange        1019
2353,_MENEDEMUS._,That he should suddenly take such an active interest
2354,_MENEDEMUS._,"In my affairs. I think he’s a little meddlesome,"
2355,_MENEDEMUS._,With all his kindness and thought. But that’s the way
2356,_MENEDEMUS._,of the world.                                           [_Exit._
2357,_MENEDEMUS._,
2358,_MENEDEMUS._,_Re-enter Chremes and Pamphilus._
2359,_MENEDEMUS._,
2360,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._ See Gorgo at once, I say, and get it back if you can."
2361,_MENEDEMUS._,
2362,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Pam._ Why, father?"
2363,_MENEDEMUS._,
2364,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._        I’ll tell you. Clinia your friend is dead.
2365,_MENEDEMUS._,
2366,_MENEDEMUS._,_Pam._ Impossible.
2367,_MENEDEMUS._,
2368,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._       No. I have seen two Persians just arrived,"
2369,_MENEDEMUS._,Who say he was slain in battle.
2370,_MENEDEMUS._,
2371,_MENEDEMUS._,_Pam._                    Does old Menedemus know?
2372,_MENEDEMUS._,
2373,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ He does.
2374,_MENEDEMUS._,
2375,_MENEDEMUS._,_Pam._    And how does he take it?
2376,_MENEDEMUS._,
2377,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                             Why? How should he take it?
2378,_MENEDEMUS._,
2379,_MENEDEMUS._,_Pam._ How should I know? The cross old hunks.
2380,_MENEDEMUS._,
2381,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                                   Stop! Pamphilus.
2382,_MENEDEMUS._,"You wrong him; he’s distracted: and now in consequence,      1029"
2383,_MENEDEMUS._,He has made up his mind to adopt that woman.
2384,_MENEDEMUS._,
2385,_MENEDEMUS._,_Pam._                                 Gorgo?
2386,_MENEDEMUS._,
2387,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._                                        Yes.
2388,_MENEDEMUS._,How can you laugh?
2389,_MENEDEMUS._,
2390,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Pam._       Well, if he adopts her, what’s the use"
2391,_MENEDEMUS._,Of asking her for the money now? Menedemus will pay.
2392,_MENEDEMUS._,
2393,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._ You do, please, as I say. Of course it’s impossible"
2394,_MENEDEMUS._,"To adopt her: I intimated to him as much, but still"
2395,_MENEDEMUS._,He wants to judge for himself. I promised to send her tó him.
2396,_MENEDEMUS._,As soon as the ladies return from the bath explain this tó her.
2397,_MENEDEMUS._,And take her across; at least if I’m not back from town.
2398,_MENEDEMUS._,
2399,_MENEDEMUS._,_Pam._ You go to the town?
2400,_MENEDEMUS._,
2401,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._               I have promised to bring these Persians back;
2402,_MENEDEMUS._,We wish to establish the news they brought. They half engaged      1039
2403,_MENEDEMUS._,"To await me here, but it seems they are gone."
2404,_MENEDEMUS._,
2405,_MENEDEMUS._,_Pam._                                  Can I go fór you?
2406,_MENEDEMUS._,
2407,_MENEDEMUS._,"_Chr._ Ay, ay. Yet no. (_aside_) Nay, I shall have to explain to them"
2408,_MENEDEMUS._,"That I am not Menedemus,—I fear I must go myself."
2409,_MENEDEMUS._,"I think I shall not be long. You do as I told you, please;"
2410,_MENEDEMUS._,And tell your mother where I am gone.
2411,_MENEDEMUS._,
2412,_MENEDEMUS._,_Pam._                          I hope you’ll find them.
2413,_MENEDEMUS._,
2414,_MENEDEMUS._,_Chr._ I shan’t come back without ’em.                         [_Exit._

2444,_CLINIA._,

2447,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._                  Nay indeed, good Pamphilus,"
2448,_CLINIA._,I am much obliged for all your kindness; I say so again.
2449,_CLINIA._,But this I told you expressly I did not wish.

2452,_CLINIA._,More than you ever hoped. Antiphila here: your father
2453,_CLINIA._,Brought nicely round: and all through my good management.
2454,_CLINIA._,And now you’ll throw me over for want of a little patience.
2455,_CLINIA._,
2456,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._ To be free with you, I do not like being half"
2457,_CLINIA._,"drawn in, as I am,"
2458,_CLINIA._,To tricking your father of fifty pounds. Besides I am here
2459,_CLINIA._,"Under a false name, as his guest. Antiphila too"
2460,_CLINIA._,"Is passing off for somebody else, I know not who;"
2461,_CLINIA._,"While you and Philolaches have deceived your father and mine,      1061"

2472,_CHREMES._,Wheu! bah! and all this worry and flurry for nothing: wheu!
2473,_CHREMES._,I am covered and choked with dust. I wish most heartily
2474,_CHREMES._,These Persians had found their grave at Chrysnotaparoys.
2475,_CHREMES._,I vow that the famous army of Darius never gave
2476,_CHREMES._,"Such trouble to brave Miltiades at Marathon,"
2477,_CHREMES._,As these two rascally slinkers have given to me. Wheu! Wheu!    1070

2480,_CHREMES._,
2481,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                    If I have found them? No.
2482,_CHREMES._,"I went to the port; the ship I found there sure enough,"
2483,_CHREMES._,"But I could not hear of them. A single passenger,"
2484,_CHREMES._,"They said, had landed; and he was a Greek. I enquired besides"
2485,_CHREMES._,"At all the houses along the road: there was not a man,"
2486,_CHREMES._,Who had even so much as seen them.
2487,_CHREMES._,

2500,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._                 She is found, she is found!"
2501,_SOSTRATA._,
2502,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._ Who’s found?
2503,_SOSTRATA._,
2504,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._       Our daughter, our long-lost daughter"
2505,_SOSTRATA._,is found.
2506,_SOSTRATA._,
2507,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._             What now?
2508,_SOSTRATA._,
2509,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._ Look! this is the necklace, this the ring."
2510,_SOSTRATA._,
2511,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._                                       Why, what d’ye mean?"
2512,_SOSTRATA._,
2513,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._ See, husband, if you remember them; they are the"
2514,_SOSTRATA._,very same                                                   1080
2515,_SOSTRATA._,"Our daughter Antiphila wore, the day she was stolen."

2517,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._                                         Hey!
2518,_SOSTRATA._,What’s this?
2519,_SOSTRATA._,
2520,_SOSTRATA._,_Sost._      I knew them at once.
2521,_SOSTRATA._,
2522,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._                      Then tell me at once, whén,"
2523,_SOSTRATA._,"How, and where did you find them?"
2524,_SOSTRATA._,
2525,_SOSTRATA._,_Sost._                     The girl that Gorgo brought
2526,_SOSTRATA._,Wore them. I knew them at once: and when I heard her name....
2527,_SOSTRATA._,
2528,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._ Antiphila?
2529,_SOSTRATA._,
2530,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._     Yes, Antiphila."
2531,_SOSTRATA._,
2532,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._                      Quite so. You heard the name;
2533,_SOSTRATA._,That made you think this girl our daughter: I’ll wager my life
2534,_SOSTRATA._,She’s no such thing. ’Tis unsupposable.
2535,_SOSTRATA._,
2536,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._                           Dearest husband,"
2537,_SOSTRATA._,I always knew we should find her. I’ve said so a thousand times.
2538,_SOSTRATA._,
2539,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._ Oh yes! you always knew beforehand of everything      1089
2540,_SOSTRATA._,"After it happened, wife: there’s nothing could occur"
2541,_SOSTRATA._,But you would tell me you told me before. And yet this time
2542,_SOSTRATA._,Do not be wise too soon.
2543,_SOSTRATA._,
2544,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._            Why, here’s the ring itself,"
2545,_SOSTRATA._,The necklace and the name.
2546,_SOSTRATA._,
2547,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._               The name is a common name,"
2548,_SOSTRATA._,"And rings and necklaces too are made so much alike,"
2549,_SOSTRATA._,They’re nothing to go by.
2550,_SOSTRATA._,
2551,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._             Then I have spoken to her, Chremes,"
2552,_SOSTRATA._,And she is so like her:—
2553,_SOSTRATA._,
2554,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._              Hey! here’s fine proof indeed;
2555,_SOSTRATA._,Just think for once now what you have said. You recognize
2556,_SOSTRATA._,"In a grown-up lady, you say, the baby you have never seen"
2557,_SOSTRATA._,"Since she was three! Why, even supposing she was not changed"
2558,_SOSTRATA._,"In all these fifteen years, could you remember her"
2559,_SOSTRATA._,So long?
2560,_SOSTRATA._,
2561,_SOSTRATA._,_Sost._  But she is my daughter: that makes the difference.      1101
2562,_SOSTRATA._,
2563,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._ Why, that’s the very question. Is she? And if she was,"
2564,_SOSTRATA._,"What difference could it make? But if you have spoken with her,"
2565,_SOSTRATA._,Where does she say she comes from?
2566,_SOSTRATA._,
2567,_SOSTRATA._,_Sost._                      She says she lives in the town
2568,_SOSTRATA._,With an old Corinthian widow ...
2569,_SOSTRATA._,
2570,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._                     I know: the mother of Gorgo.
2571,_SOSTRATA._,"They live together, do they? Then just send Gorgo here."
2572,_SOSTRATA._,
2573,_SOSTRATA._,_Sost._ Indeed she has nothing to do with Gorgo.
2574,_SOSTRATA._,
2575,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._                                     According to that
2576,_SOSTRATA._,There are two Corinthian widows.
2577,_SOSTRATA._,
2578,_SOSTRATA._,_Sost._                    Two?
2579,_SOSTRATA._,
2580,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._                          Why not? I suppose
2581,_SOSTRATA._,"There must be two, unless it’s the same."
2582,_SOSTRATA._,
2583,_SOSTRATA._,_Sost._                            But who is the other?
2584,_SOSTRATA._,
2585,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._ There isn’t another at all. Bring Gorgo here at once.    1110
2586,_SOSTRATA._,She’ll know enough of the facts to set this matter at rest.
2587,_SOSTRATA._,
2588,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._ Why, Chremes ..."
2589,_SOSTRATA._,
2590,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._             I say, fetch Gorgo."
2591,_SOSTRATA._,
2592,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._                                I assure you, Chremes dear ..."
2593,_SOSTRATA._,
2594,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._ Do go and fetch her, wife."
2595,_SOSTRATA._,
2596,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._                     Well, as you will...."
2597,_SOSTRATA._,
2598,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._                                            Of course.
2599,_SOSTRATA._,"Dó I ever express an opinion, issue a command,"
2600,_SOSTRATA._,Without an ample reason? (_Exit Sostrata._)
2601,_SOSTRATA._,"’Twould be strange!—(_To Pam._) Now, sir,"
2602,_SOSTRATA._,Had you not heard of this?
2603,_SOSTRATA._,
2604,_SOSTRATA._,"_Pam._               No, father."
2605,_SOSTRATA._,
2606,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._                           And there you stand,"
2607,_SOSTRATA._,"As dull as a fish! Why, what will you think, if this be true,"
2608,_SOSTRATA._,Of finding a sister?
2609,_SOSTRATA._,
2610,_SOSTRATA._,"_Pam._         Sir, you wished me a happy day:"
2611,_SOSTRATA._,"As nothing was more unlooked for, nothing is happier"
2612,_SOSTRATA._,In the world than this.
2613,_SOSTRATA._,
2614,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._            Yet there’s your friend, a perfect stranger."
2615,_SOSTRATA._,"Is far more moved than you. You go to the play, I know:         1121"
2616,_SOSTRATA._,Fifty per cent. of all our Attic comedies
2617,_SOSTRATA._,"Have this same plot, a daughter stolen in early years,"
2618,_SOSTRATA._,"Lost sight of, despaired of, almost forgotten, and then at last,"
2619,_SOSTRATA._,When least expected—although there’s scarce a soul in the house
2620,_SOSTRATA._,That does not know or guess it beforehand—she reappears.
2621,_SOSTRATA._,"Then are not all eyes wet? Why, that’s the poetic art,"
2622,_SOSTRATA._,"Which makes emotion, and sells it to fools at market price."
2623,_SOSTRATA._,"You have pitied the child, have pictured the thousand possible ills"
2624,_SOSTRATA._,"She may have encountered, hardships of body and mind,"
2625,_SOSTRATA._,"neglect,                                                    1130"
2626,_SOSTRATA._,"The injuries and privations of slavery, wrongs and blows;"
2627,_SOSTRATA._,"The lack of all that care, to which, in a mother’s love,"
2628,_SOSTRATA._,"The meanest birth is titled, without which even brutes"
2629,_SOSTRATA._,Perish for lack of instinct: the tenderness of sex
2630,_SOSTRATA._,"You have thought of; her innocence, the snares of a merciless world"
2631,_SOSTRATA._,"For the unprotected, and then this picture you contrast"
2632,_SOSTRATA._,"With the comfortable, gentéel hóme the scene presents."
2633,_SOSTRATA._,"You feel for the parents then—ay, tho’ some ridicule"
2634,_SOSTRATA._,Be fastened upon them; ’tis by such touches of flesh and blood
2635,_SOSTRATA._,"The life comes home to your heart, and while you are made"
2636,_SOSTRATA._,"to smile,                                                   1140"
2637,_SOSTRATA._,"You weep. You have paid for the tear, or if your false shame"
2638,_SOSTRATA._,"Forbids you to shew your feeling, you’ve bought a lump in the throat."
2639,_SOSTRATA._,"You praise the play, because ’tis a tender situation."
2640,_SOSTRATA._,Enough to stir the blood of a crocodile like yourself:
2641,_SOSTRATA._,I catch you weeping—slap! all’s changed. ’Tis not a play:
2642,_SOSTRATA._,"The stage is yóur hóme, the actors your father and mother,"
2643,_SOSTRATA._,"Your own sister is found, & where’s your feeling now?"
2644,_SOSTRATA._,"I think your heart is made of matting! Your friend, I say,"
2645,_SOSTRATA._,Is far more moved: I see the tears stand in his eyes.
2646,_SOSTRATA._,
2647,_SOSTRATA._,"_Clin._ ’Tis joy. I wish you joy, sir. I wish your"
2648,_SOSTRATA._,daughter joy.                                               1150
2649,_SOSTRATA._,"And, may I say it, your happiness brings happiness to me."
2650,_SOSTRATA._,
2651,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._ I thank you, Clitipho; but now we go too fast:"
2652,_SOSTRATA._,Because I don’t at all suppose this is my daughter.
2653,_SOSTRATA._,Ho! Gorgo! where’s Gorgo? (_Goes to door._)
2654,_SOSTRATA._,
2655,_SOSTRATA._,"_Clin._ (_to Pam._).      O Pamphilus, I am in heaven:"
2656,_SOSTRATA._,"For if Antiphila really be your sister, then"
2657,_SOSTRATA._,My father cannot oppose our marriage.
2658,_SOSTRATA._,
2659,_SOSTRATA._,_Pam._                          No more will mine.
2660,_SOSTRATA._,’Twill make him as proud as a peacock.
2661,_SOSTRATA._,
2662,_SOSTRATA._,_Clin._                          Sweetest Antiphila.
2663,_SOSTRATA._,
2664,_SOSTRATA._,"_Pam._ Quite so: but what in the world do you think will happen to me,"
2665,_SOSTRATA._,When he finds out?
2666,_SOSTRATA._,
2667,_SOSTRATA._,"_Clin._      Oh, I have attained the life of the gods!"
2668,_SOSTRATA._,
2669,_SOSTRATA._,_Pam._ Go on. You will not tell me now I have done too much?      1160
2670,_SOSTRATA._,
2671,_SOSTRATA._,_Clin._ Oh no: I forgive it all.
2672,_SOSTRATA._,
2673,_SOSTRATA._,_Pam._                     Forgive it?
2674,_SOSTRATA._,
2675,_SOSTRATA._,_Clin._                                I thank you for it.
2676,_SOSTRATA._,
2677,_SOSTRATA._,_Pam._ I shall need more than thanks.
2678,_SOSTRATA._,
2679,_SOSTRATA._,"_Clin._                         O Pamphilus, anything."
2680,_SOSTRATA._,What can I give you?
2681,_SOSTRATA._,
2682,_SOSTRATA._,"_Pam._         Listen. If things go well with you,"
2683,_SOSTRATA._,"They’re not so smart with me: and if you wish to help me,"
2684,_SOSTRATA._,I only see one hope.
2685,_SOSTRATA._,
2686,_SOSTRATA._,_Clin._        What’s that?
2687,_SOSTRATA._,
2688,_SOSTRATA._,_Pam._                      That you should win
2689,_SOSTRATA._,"Your father to plead for me: after all I have done for him,"
2690,_SOSTRATA._,"I think he might: and if you ask him, I am sure he will."
2691,_SOSTRATA._,"Concealment is out of the question: go to him now at once,"
2692,_SOSTRATA._,And tell him all.
2693,_SOSTRATA._,
2694,_SOSTRATA._,_Clin._     Indeed I was going; but may I not see
2695,_SOSTRATA._,Antiphila first?
2696,_SOSTRATA._,
2697,_SOSTRATA._,"_Pam._     No, no, there’s not a moment to lose."
2698,_SOSTRATA._,"The governor will be back, and if he finds you out,"
2699,_SOSTRATA._,"You’ll have to go to your father with him, and what a tale      1172"
2700,_SOSTRATA._,He’ll tell it’s easy to guess.
2701,_SOSTRATA._,
2702,_SOSTRATA._,_Clin._                  I would not consent to that.
2703,_SOSTRATA._,I’ll go at once.
2704,_SOSTRATA._,
2705,_SOSTRATA._,"_Pam._     Go quickly, before Gorgo comes."
2706,_SOSTRATA._,Quick! Quick!                                        [_Exit Clinia._
2707,_SOSTRATA._,And just in time. I wonder what she will say.
2708,_SOSTRATA._,
2709,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._ (_at the door to Gorgo_). I want you a moment, Gorgo."
2710,_SOSTRATA._,
2711,_SOSTRATA._,_Enter Gorgo with Sostrata._
2712,_SOSTRATA._,
2713,_SOSTRATA._,"Prithee, be so good"
2714,_SOSTRATA._,As just to answer my questions. This girl Antiphila
2715,_SOSTRATA._,"Who came with you, is your maid? Don’t look at my son and laugh."
2716,_SOSTRATA._,I am serious. Is this girl your servant?
2717,_SOSTRATA._,
2718,_GORGO._,_GORGO._
2719,_GORGO._,No.
2720,_GORGO._,
2721,_GORGO._,_Chr._                                 She is not?
2722,_GORGO._,She lives with you?
2723,_GORGO._,
2724,_GORGO._,_Gor._          No.
2725,_GORGO._,
2726,_GORGO._,"_Chr._ I thought you lived with the widow woman,"
2727,_GORGO._,Who came from Corinth. Pray be sober. I want to know.           1181
2728,_GORGO._,You told me you did.
2729,_GORGO._,
2730,_GORGO._,"_Gor._         Ay, sir."
2731,_GORGO._,
2732,_GORGO._,_Chr._                  And yet Antiphila
2733,_GORGO._,Does not live with you?
2734,_GORGO._,
2735,_GORGO._,"_Gor._            No, sir."
2736,_GORGO._,
2737,_GORGO._,_Chr._                     When did you see her first?
2738,_GORGO._,
2739,_GORGO._,_Gor._ This morning.
2740,_GORGO._,
2741,_GORGO._,_Chr._         Indeed. And can you tell me nothing about her?
2742,_GORGO._,
2743,_GORGO._,_Gor._ Nothing whatever.
2744,_GORGO._,
2745,_GORGO._,_Chr._             I thank you. I’ve nothing to ask you then.
2746,_GORGO._,
2747,_GORGO._,"_Gor._ It’s thank you for nothing, sir! No further commands"
2748,_GORGO._,at present?
2749,_GORGO._,
2750,_GORGO._,"_Chr._ Peace, prithee, peace!"
2751,_GORGO._,"(_To Sostrata._) Now, wife, you see I was right for once."
2752,_GORGO._,Gorgo knows nothing about her.
2753,_GORGO._,
2754,_GORGO._,"_Sost._                  I told you she didn’t, Chremes."
2755,_GORGO._,
2756,_GORGO._,_Chr._ But then you said she lived with the widow. You see
2757,_GORGO._,"she doesn’t,                                                1189"
2758,_GORGO._,And Gorgo does.
2759,_GORGO._,
2760,_GORGO._,_Sost._   I can’t believe it. Antiphila told me
2761,_GORGO._,The widow’s name; and then the very clothes she wore
2762,_GORGO._,"The day she was stolen, she has laid by."
2763,_GORGO._,
2764,_GORGO._,_Chr._                             Eh! said she so?
2765,_GORGO._,"Then you should have sent for the woman, told her to bring the clothes."
2766,_GORGO._,
2767,_GORGO._,"_Sost._ So, Chremes, I did, but the poor old lady’s too ill to come:"
2768,_GORGO._,But the clothes were sent. I have seen them.
2769,_GORGO._,
2770,_GORGO._,_Chr._                       And are they the same?
2771,_GORGO._,
2772,_GORGO._,_Sost._                                     They are.
2773,_GORGO._,
2774,_GORGO._,"_Chr._ Why then did you not spare me all this trouble, wife?"
2775,_GORGO._,Why did you not tell me before of the clothes?
2776,_GORGO._,
2777,_GORGO._,_Sost._                                  You would not hear!
2778,_GORGO._,
2779,_GORGO._,_Chr._ Not hear! when all the time I was asking you this and that.
2780,_GORGO._,Ye gods! have ye never made one reasonable woman?
2781,_GORGO._,Don’t you see that the clothes are the chiefest
2782,_GORGO._,matter of all?                                              1200
2783,_GORGO._,"Why, they’re a proof."
2784,_GORGO._,
2785,_GORGO._,_Sost._         Then do you believe?
2786,_GORGO._,
2787,_GORGO._,"_Chr._                               Ay, wife, come in."
2788,_GORGO._,I think we have found our daughter.
2789,_GORGO._,
2790,_GORGO._,_Gor._ Oho! ho! ho!                         [_Exeunt Sost. and Chr._
2791,_GORGO._,O he does make me laugh.
2792,_GORGO._,"And when he finds all out, the silly old man, at last,"
2793,_GORGO._,How I shall love to see him!
2794,_GORGO._,
2795,_GORGO._,_Pam._                 Indeed you must not stay.
2796,_GORGO._,
2797,_GORGO._,_Gor._ Why not?
2798,_GORGO._,
2799,_GORGO._,"_Pam._    Why, don’t you see how mad he’ll be?"
2800,_GORGO._,
2801,_GORGO._,_Gor._                                         He will.
2802,_GORGO._,
2803,_GORGO._,_Pam._ He’ll want that forty pounds.
2804,_GORGO._,
2805,_GORGO._,_Gor._                         He may want.
2806,_GORGO._,
2807,_GORGO._,_Pam._                                      I am afraid
2808,_GORGO._,You cannot keep it.
2809,_GORGO._,
2810,_GORGO._,_Gor._        I not keep it? What! d’ye think
2811,_GORGO._,I’d give it him back?
2812,_GORGO._,
2813,_GORGO._,_Pam._          I think you had better make sure of it.
2814,_GORGO._,Take my advice and go.
2815,_GORGO._,
2816,_GORGO._,"_Gor._           I am sorry to go, and yet"
2817,_GORGO._,What should I stay for now? There’ll be no dinner.
2818,_GORGO._,
2819,_GORGO._,"_Pam._                                       No,                1210"
2820,_GORGO._,That there won’t.
2821,_GORGO._,
2822,_GORGO._,"_Gor._      Well, make my excuses, & give your father"
2823,_GORGO._,My kind congratulations.
2824,_GORGO._,
2825,_GORGO._,_Pam._             Go!
2826,_GORGO._,
2827,_GORGO._,_Gor._                 With the same to you.
2828,_GORGO._,Antiphila’s quite a dove.
2829,_GORGO._,
2830,_GORGO._,_Pam._              Do go!
2831,_GORGO._,
2832,_GORGO._,"_Gor._                           Good-bye, my lad."
2833,_GORGO._,"It’s wisest to go, I see: but if the old man should ask"
2834,_GORGO._,Where I am gone to ...
2835,_GORGO._,
2836,_GORGO._,_Pam._           Well?
2837,_GORGO._,
2838,_GORGO._,"_Gor._                 Why, tell him I’m gone to spend"
2839,_GORGO._,His forty pounds in the town. Ta ta!                        [_Exit._
2840,_GORGO._,
2841,_GORGO._,_Pam._                         I think that woman
2842,_GORGO._,"Has done for me. Thank the gods she’s gone, and just in time;"
2843,_GORGO._,Here somebody comes from the house.
2844,_GORGO._,
2845,_GORGO._,_Enter Philolaches from Chremes’ house._
2846,_GORGO._,
2847,_PHILOLACHES._,_PHILOLACHES._
2848,_PHILOLACHES._,
2849,_PHILOLACHES._,"Look out, Pamphilus!"
2850,_PHILOLACHES._,Your father is coming after you.
2851,_PHILOLACHES._,
2852,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                     He has found us out of course?
2853,_PHILOLACHES._,
2854,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ He has guessed who Gorgo is; but still is quite in
2855,_PHILOLACHES._,the dark.                                                    1220
2856,_PHILOLACHES._,He still imagines Clinia slain and torn to bits
2857,_PHILOLACHES._,On the plains of what d’ye call it.—
2858,_PHILOLACHES._,
2859,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                          What is best to do?
2860,_PHILOLACHES._,
2861,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._ Nothing. Let him rave it out. The quicker he heats,"
2862,_PHILOLACHES._,The quicker he’ll cool.
2863,_PHILOLACHES._,
2864,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._            But if you had ever seen him angry ...
2865,_PHILOLACHES._,
2866,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ Don’t be afraid.
2867,_PHILOLACHES._,
2868,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._           I am.
2869,_PHILOLACHES._,
2870,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                  Throw all the blame on me.
2871,_PHILOLACHES._,
2872,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._ I hear him.
2873,_PHILOLACHES._,
2874,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Re-enter Chremes, speaking as he comes out to Sostrata within._"
2875,_PHILOLACHES._,
2876,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._       It’s high time, wife, you stopped this precious noise,"
2877,_PHILOLACHES._,Deafening the gods with singing all your confounded praises
2878,_PHILOLACHES._,"For finding your daughter. You judge them by yourself perhaps,"
2879,_PHILOLACHES._,"And think they can’t understand a simple thing, unless"
2880,_PHILOLACHES._,It’s told them a hundred times.
2881,_PHILOLACHES._,"(_To Pam._)                     Now, sir, ’tis you I want.      1230"
2882,_PHILOLACHES._,Come here.
2883,_PHILOLACHES._,
2884,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._     What, father?"
2885,_PHILOLACHES._,
2886,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._             _What, father?_ As innocent"
2887,_PHILOLACHES._,"As milk, no doubt. You think it’s possible I do not know?"
2888,_PHILOLACHES._,"I’ll tell you what: to-day I have found a daughter, sir,"
2889,_PHILOLACHES._,And lost a son. Begone and take your Gorgo with you:
2890,_PHILOLACHES._,For I’ll not own you longer. Be off! Go where you will:
2891,_PHILOLACHES._,But see you ne’er set foot beneath my roof again.
2892,_PHILOLACHES._,
2893,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._ Father, what do you mean? What have I done?"
2894,_PHILOLACHES._,
2895,_PHILOLACHES._,_Chr._                                       You dare
2896,_PHILOLACHES._,"Ask! If I tell you now that you are a reprobate,"
2897,_PHILOLACHES._,"An idle, dissipated, licentious, spendthrift fellow:—"
2898,_PHILOLACHES._,Is that enough?
2899,_PHILOLACHES._,
2900,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._    O father!
2901,_PHILOLACHES._,
2902,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._              Or if I add the rest,                       1240"
2903,_PHILOLACHES._,"A mean, deceitful, undutiful, snivelling, sneaking cheat;"
2904,_PHILOLACHES._,A liar.
2905,_PHILOLACHES._,
2906,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._ Oh, I am not."
2907,_PHILOLACHES._,
2908,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._         Well, you deny it, do you?"
2909,_PHILOLACHES._,"I’ll ask you is this true or not. You found that I,"
2910,_PHILOLACHES._,"With a view to help our neighbour, wished to see the girl"
2911,_PHILOLACHES._,That got his son into trouble. You undertook to bring her.
2912,_PHILOLACHES._,"I trusted you wholly, could not expect to be played on bý you;"
2913,_PHILOLACHES._,"You knew her, and I did not, had never heard her name;"
2914,_PHILOLACHES._,"And this you knew, and took occasion to introduce"
2915,_PHILOLACHES._,"A different person altogether, a friend of your own,"
2916,_PHILOLACHES._,A woman whose very presence was an insult; and not content      1250
2917,_PHILOLACHES._,"With abusing my confidence & kindness, my sheer disgust"
2918,_PHILOLACHES._,"You turned to your own account, and so, on a mock pretence"
2919,_PHILOLACHES._,"Of doing my neighbour a wonderful service, made me pay"
2920,_PHILOLACHES._,"I don’t know what. You blinded me, and robbed me, and all the while"
2921,_PHILOLACHES._,"’Twas yóur víle místress I was entertaining for you,"
2922,_PHILOLACHES._,And paying out of my pocket for nothing. Is that not true?
2923,_PHILOLACHES._,Was it not enough to have this creature sit down to dine
2924,_PHILOLACHES._,"With your mother and me? ay, and with your sister? and as for her,"
2925,_PHILOLACHES._,"Yóu have been the means of aspersing her character,"
2926,_PHILOLACHES._,"The day when she is restored to the family. Yes, ’tis she       1260"
2927,_PHILOLACHES._,"Is the lady in question, and I have been running here and there"
2928,_PHILOLACHES._,"To diffame my own daughter to my neighbour, and thanks to you"
2929,_PHILOLACHES._,"Have been a pretty fool! And if his son returns,—"
2930,_PHILOLACHES._,For now I am so confused that whether he’s living or dead
2931,_PHILOLACHES._,"I have not a notion,—but if, I say, he should return,"
2932,_PHILOLACHES._,"And ask Antiphila’s hand, would then Menedemus believe"
2933,_PHILOLACHES._,That I did not tell him the truth before I knew any cause
2934,_PHILOLACHES._,To wish for one thing more than another? I say be off!
2935,_PHILOLACHES._,Ask me what you’ve done? A treasure of innocence
2936,_PHILOLACHES._,You are! Begone! I’ll never see you again. Begone!
2937,_PHILOLACHES._,
2938,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._ For patience’ sake, one word from me, sir! Pamphilus      1271"
2939,_PHILOLACHES._,Was not so much in fault; I am the one to blame:
2940,_PHILOLACHES._,He truly intended to introduce Antiphila;
2941,_PHILOLACHES._,And I was sent to fetch her: but when it appeared her friends
2942,_PHILOLACHES._,Would not consent to allow that you should interfere
2943,_PHILOLACHES._,"Between Menedemus and her, then, on the spur of the moment,"
2944,_PHILOLACHES._,"The ladies were changed, & that at my suggestion, sir."
2945,_PHILOLACHES._,
2946,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._ I interfere, you say? ’Tis you that interfere,"
2947,_PHILOLACHES._,"I think. Pray hold your tongue; or if you wish to advise,"
2948,_PHILOLACHES._,Advise your friend again: he needs it more than I;
2949,_PHILOLACHES._,Maybe he’ll thank you for it. I neither ask nor want it.        1281
2950,_PHILOLACHES._,
2951,_PHILOLACHES._,_Re-enter Sostrata._
2952,_PHILOLACHES._,
2953,_PHILOLACHES._,"(_To Pam._) To you, sir, I have no more to add. Begone at once!"
2954,_PHILOLACHES._,"’Twill spare your sister pain, if she sh^d never know you;"
2955,_PHILOLACHES._,"Not that there’s aught to lose. Now, if there is anything"
2956,_PHILOLACHES._,"You want in the house, go in at once and fetch it. Look,"
2957,_PHILOLACHES._,I’ll give you half an hour.
2958,_PHILOLACHES._,
2959,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Sost._               Chremes, what are you saying?"
2960,_PHILOLACHES._,
2961,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._ I have only said, wife, what I told you; and you may now"
2962,_PHILOLACHES._,Bid your dear Pamphilus good-bye.
2963,_PHILOLACHES._,
2964,_PHILOLACHES._,_Sost._                     How cruel you are!
2965,_PHILOLACHES._,"Do you wish to kill your son? You’ll certainly be his death,    1289"
2966,_PHILOLACHES._,Unless you mind. I wonder how anything so wicked
2967,_PHILOLACHES._,Could have come into your head.
2968,_PHILOLACHES._,
2969,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._                    Oh, will you never learn"
2970,_PHILOLACHES._,"To keep your place, woman? Was there ever a thing"
2971,_PHILOLACHES._,"Which I ever proposed or did in my whole life, in which"
2972,_PHILOLACHES._,You did not go against me? But sh^d I ask you now
2973,_PHILOLACHES._,"What wrong I am doing, or why I do the thing I do,"
2974,_PHILOLACHES._,You would not know: you could not tell me anything
2975,_PHILOLACHES._,Of the matter in which so confidently you oppose me. Fool!
2976,_PHILOLACHES._,
2977,_PHILOLACHES._,_Sost._ I do not know?
2978,_PHILOLACHES._,
2979,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._           Well, well, you do know. Anything"
2980,_PHILOLACHES._,Rather than have it all over again.
2981,_PHILOLACHES._,
2982,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Sost._                       How iniquitous of you,"
2983,_PHILOLACHES._,To prevent my speaking in such a matter!
2984,_PHILOLACHES._,
2985,_PHILOLACHES._,_Chr._                             I don’t prevent you.         1300
2986,_PHILOLACHES._,Go on! Talk yourself hoarse.                                [_Exit._
2987,_PHILOLACHES._,
2988,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._                 Mother, what shall I do?"
2989,_PHILOLACHES._,
2990,_PHILOLACHES._,_Sost._ What did he say?
2991,_PHILOLACHES._,
2992,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._             He says he disowns me.
2993,_PHILOLACHES._,
2994,_PHILOLACHES._,_Sost._                                   Don’t give way.
2995,_PHILOLACHES._,He is angry now: I know he’ll soon be kind again.
2996,_PHILOLACHES._,
2997,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._ Quite so, madam; a father’s threats are nothing to fear."
2998,_PHILOLACHES._,
2999,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._ I am glad you think so.
3000,_PHILOLACHES._,
3001,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                    Don’t be angry with me, Pam!"
3002,_PHILOLACHES._,"I’ve got you into a mess, but if you’ll trust to me,"
3003,_PHILOLACHES._,I’ll get you out.
3004,_PHILOLACHES._,
3005,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Sost._     How kind of you, Mr. Philogelos!"
3006,_PHILOLACHES._,
3007,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph_. Take my advice and hide. Pretend you have run away.
3008,_PHILOLACHES._,I’ll say you’ve sailed to the Persian wars in Clinia’s ship.
3009,_PHILOLACHES._,"And when your father finds that Clinia is safe, and he"
3010,_PHILOLACHES._,"Demands Antiphila’s hand, the rest will be all forgotten.       1311"
3011,_PHILOLACHES._,
3012,_PHILOLACHES._,_Sost._ Is Antiphila to marry Clinia?
3013,_PHILOLACHES._,
3014,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                           Yes, ma’am."
3015,_PHILOLACHES._,
3016,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Sost._                                     Menedemus’ son,"
3017,_PHILOLACHES._,That ran away?
3018,_PHILOLACHES._,
3019,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._    Yes, ma’am."
3020,_PHILOLACHES._,
3021,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Sost._              Why, Chremes said he was killed."
3022,_PHILOLACHES._,
3023,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ It’s all a mistake; you’ve spoken to him to-day yourself:
3024,_PHILOLACHES._,He is Clitipho.
3025,_PHILOLACHES._,
3026,_PHILOLACHES._,_Sost._   O dear! I must tell Chremes this.
3027,_PHILOLACHES._,How glad I am!
3028,_PHILOLACHES._,
3029,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._    Stay, madam, stay; I pray you won’t."
3030,_PHILOLACHES._,Your husband will find that out quite soon enough for us.
3031,_PHILOLACHES._,"Far better see Menedemus, if he will help us out."
3032,_PHILOLACHES._,
3033,_PHILOLACHES._,_Sost._ What could he do?
3034,_PHILOLACHES._,
3035,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._               He’ll stand our friend. How could he wish
3036,_PHILOLACHES._,To see Antiphila’s brother driven disgraced from home?          1320
3037,_PHILOLACHES._,
3038,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Sost._ Go, Pamphilus, go at once!"
3039,_PHILOLACHES._,
3040,_PHILOLACHES._,_Pam._                       Clinia is there; I will.
3041,_PHILOLACHES._,
3042,_PHILOLACHES._,_Sost._ And can I then tell Chremes?
3043,_PHILOLACHES._,
3044,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._                          Madam, consider this:"
3045,_PHILOLACHES._,"He won’t believe you, and after will only be angry with you"
3046,_PHILOLACHES._,"For knowing it first, and being in the right when he was wrong."
3047,_PHILOLACHES._,
3048,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Sost._ ’Tis all so strange, that really and truly I don’t suppose"
3049,_PHILOLACHES._,That any one would believe it. It may be best to wait.
3050,_PHILOLACHES._,"But you should waste no time, Pamphilus; go at once."
3051,_PHILOLACHES._,
3052,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Pam._ I go, but do not tell him where I am gone."
3053,_PHILOLACHES._,
3054,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Sost._                                     No, son.    [_Exit Pam._"
3055,_PHILOLACHES._,"I’ll do my best to win him. (_To Ph._) I thank you, sir, very kindly."
3056,_PHILOLACHES._,
3057,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._ I wish you good success.                     [_Exit Sostrata._
3058,_PHILOLACHES._,A sensible body. I lean          1330
3059,_PHILOLACHES._,On her and old Menedemus. Not that I doubt myself;
3060,_PHILOLACHES._,I know a stroke to play: is’t not the feast of Bacchus?
3061,_PHILOLACHES._,I will invoke the god; his genius will confound
3062,_PHILOLACHES._,"This dull, contrary Chremes. What’s his humour worth"
3063,_PHILOLACHES._,"To gods or men, that I should bow to it? Nay, & since"
3064,_PHILOLACHES._,"Whate’er the humour be, ’tis the persistency"
3065,_PHILOLACHES._,"That carries it, to hell with dumps! ’Twere póor mérriment"
3066,_PHILOLACHES._,"That Chremes’ frown could dash. Why, if there be a choice       1338"
3067,_PHILOLACHES._,"’Twixt Chremes pleased and Chremes angry, of the two"
3068,_PHILOLACHES._,"This latter, angry Chremes is the more ridiculous."

3080,_MENEDEMUS._,"You have made me, my dear Clinia, the very happiest of fathers,"
3081,_MENEDEMUS._,By this return to your senses; indeed I ran great risk
3082,_MENEDEMUS._,"Of taking leave of my own: but since I have you back,"
3083,_MENEDEMUS._,’Tis nothing but happiness: and gladly I now consent
3084,_MENEDEMUS._,"To the match, which hitherto in your own interest"
3085,_MENEDEMUS._,I have only opposed because I would not have you marry
3086,_MENEDEMUS._,A woman not freeborn. To be sure I c^d have wished
3087,_MENEDEMUS._,’Twas somebody else’s daughter than Chremes’. After all
3088,_MENEDEMUS._,"It might be worse. But are you sure you hold to it still,"

3094,_CLINIA._,
3095,_CLINIA._,"_Men._ You are young to marry; but, mind, I should not make your age"
3096,_CLINIA._,"An objection, provided I thought you knew what marriage is."
3097,_CLINIA._,"But do you, can you know? You have only experience"
3098,_CLINIA._,"Of childhood, and some few years of youthful liberty:"
3099,_CLINIA._,"What can thát teach? Your tie to me, your friendships,—"
3100,_CLINIA._,Some intimate friendships too: but nothing here nor there
3101,_CLINIA._,Comparable to the bond of marriage. Suppose I say
3102,_CLINIA._,"’Tis, next to existence, the most familiar thing in"
3103,_CLINIA._,the world:—                                                 1358
3104,_CLINIA._,"Then judge how jealous pride & self-regard should be,"
3105,_CLINIA._,"Ere they admit this master circumstance to rule,"
3106,_CLINIA._,As rule it must. You know the story Plato tells
3107,_CLINIA._,"Of Er, the Armenian soldier, & what he saw in death,"
3108,_CLINIA._,Permitted to stand between the gates of heaven and hell;
3109,_CLINIA._,"How there he saw the souls, who, ere they came on earth,"
3110,_CLINIA._,"Were choosing each their lives in turn—and, what was strange,"
3111,_CLINIA._,"How wantonly and without deliberation they chose,"
3112,_CLINIA._,"Making a rush at what they fancied first: and this,"
3113,_CLINIA._,"So Plato said, explained man’s discontent on earth,"
3114,_CLINIA._,"His misery being his fault. All w^h, be it fable or no,"
3115,_CLINIA._,"Clinia, has this much truth; that you may see the like"
3116,_CLINIA._,"Without going down to the grave, nor any revelation"
3117,_CLINIA._,"Of nature’s secrecies—but every day on earth,                   1372"
3118,_CLINIA._,In men that wive. With them the stake is no less great;
3119,_CLINIA._,"Their carelessness in choice, their after-discontent"
3120,_CLINIA._,Match each in kind. Now I would play the interpreter
3121,_CLINIA._,"To you, as some celestial did to Er: I warn you,"
3122,_CLINIA._,Take not this step in haste. You choose a second being:
3123,_CLINIA._,The lives are strewn before you: is this the best to take?
3124,_CLINIA._,
3125,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._ O if you knew Antiphila, father, you would not ask."
3126,_CLINIA._,
3127,_CLINIA._,_Men._ Very well. I see your choice is made. I only wish        1380

3134,_CLINIA._,"He has not discovered yet who the two Persians were,"
3135,_CLINIA._,Who came to frighten me.
3136,_CLINIA._,
3137,_CLINIA._,"_Clin._            I hope I need not tell you, father,"
3138,_CLINIA._,I never wished that done. I feared you might be grieved:
3139,_CLINIA._,But Chremes being so sure you never would forgive me ...
3140,_CLINIA._,
3141,_CLINIA._,_Men._ Was he?
3142,_CLINIA._,
3143,_CLINIA._,_Clin._        He said you told him.
3144,_CLINIA._,
3145,_CLINIA._,_Men._                         Did he? He has been to blame.
3146,_CLINIA._,"There’s much he will have to explain to me, which he will not wish"
3147,_CLINIA._,"Another to hear. Retire to the garden, while I go"
3148,_CLINIA._,"And smooth things over with him, and ask his daughter’s hand.   1390"

3150,_CLINIA._,_Clin._ How long?
3151,_CLINIA._,
3152,_CLINIA._,"_Men._      Well, if I send, be ready at once to come:"
3153,_CLINIA._,"And see that Pamphilus too is handy: explain to him,"
3154,_CLINIA._,"That if I can be happy enough to make his peace with his father,"
3155,_CLINIA._,His presence will then be needed.
3156,_CLINIA._,

3162,_CLINIA._,"I think I have. But this same would-be helper of mine,"
3163,_CLINIA._,"My counsellor and guide, Chremes, is very far beyond me.        1399"

3174,_CHREMES._,"’Tis a happy day for us both: for you have found a daughter,"
3175,_CHREMES._,And I ...
3176,_CHREMES._,
3177,_CHREMES._,_Chr._    You know it already? Who told you?
3178,_CHREMES._,
3179,_CHREMES._,_Men._                                 My son.

3182,_CHREMES._,
3183,_CHREMES._,_Men._ Clinia. Yes. He is in my house. I was coming across
3184,_CHREMES._,To ask you to join your treasure so newly found with mine:
3185,_CHREMES._,And to give your daughter to-day to my son in marriage.

3187,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                                            Well!
3188,_CHREMES._,I cannot understand it. Where did he come from? When?
3189,_CHREMES._,
3190,_CHREMES._,"_Men._ Why, that’s the strangest of all: he landed only"
3191,_CHREMES._,"this morning,                                               1410"
3192,_CHREMES._,Met your son in the town; & has been in yóur house
3193,_CHREMES._,Ever since.
3194,_CHREMES._,
3195,_CHREMES._,_Chr._      My house?
3196,_CHREMES._,
3197,_CHREMES._,_Men._          It seems your son is a friend of his:
3198,_CHREMES._,"He introduced him, but under another name, because"
3199,_CHREMES._,He did not wish to be known.
3200,_CHREMES._,
3201,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                 Not Clitipho?
3202,_CHREMES._,
3203,_CHREMES._,"_Men._                               Ay, ’twas that."
3204,_CHREMES._,
3205,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ There then! O how I have been deceived! And you were right
3206,_CHREMES._,About the Persians too: they were a make-believe.
3207,_CHREMES._,
3208,_CHREMES._,"_Men._ So I guessed all along, Chremes."
3209,_CHREMES._,
3210,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                            But who then were they?
3211,_CHREMES._,
3212,_CHREMES._,"_Men._ Forgive me, my good friend, I ask you once for all,"
3213,_CHREMES._,The annoyance my family affairs have been to you to-day.        1419
3214,_CHREMES._,Your kindness has brought you only vexation.
3215,_CHREMES._,
3216,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._                                 O, I am sure"
3217,_CHREMES._,You are welcome enough to any service that I can render.
3218,_CHREMES._,
3219,_CHREMES._,"_Men._ Then pray oblige me in this, and overlook the folly"
3220,_CHREMES._,Of the actors in thís fárce. The intention was to deceive
3221,_CHREMES._,"Me and not you: till you accidentally, as it seems,"
3222,_CHREMES._,Came in their way: and then they could not help themselves:
3223,_CHREMES._,They even tried to avoid you.
3224,_CHREMES._,
3225,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                  Who were they?

3229,_CHREMES._,"To droll on a private person, at a time that is set apart"
3230,_CHREMES._,"For mirth and jollity, and when buffoonery too makes up"
3231,_CHREMES._,A part of the festival.
3232,_CHREMES._,
3233,_CHREMES._,_Chr._            I think no gentleman                          1430
3234,_CHREMES._,Should suffer buffoonery to cover an insult.

3236,_CHREMES._,"_Men._                                 Supposing not,"
3237,_CHREMES._,Yet none was intended.
3238,_CHREMES._,
3239,_CHREMES._,_Chr._           Who were they?
3240,_CHREMES._,
3241,_CHREMES._,"_Men._                          The deceit was planned for me,"
3242,_CHREMES._,And I forgive it.
3243,_CHREMES._,
3244,_CHREMES._,_Chr._      Who were they?
3245,_CHREMES._,
3246,_CHREMES._,_Men._                     They came from yóur house.
3247,_CHREMES._,
3248,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ Not Clinia?
3249,_CHREMES._,
3250,_CHREMES._,_Men._       No; although it was done in his interest.
3251,_CHREMES._,"Your son was one, and a friend ..."
3252,_CHREMES._,
3253,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                       I know: Philolaches.
3254,_CHREMES._,I see.
3255,_CHREMES._,
3256,_CHREMES._,"_Men._ It seems they had drawn from you, I know not how,"
3257,_CHREMES._,Somewhat too harsh a picture of me: so ’twas resolved
3258,_CHREMES._,To put me to proof.
3259,_CHREMES._,
3260,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._        Menedemus, since ’twas my own son,"
3261,_CHREMES._,It does not matter; for now my account with him is closed.
3262,_CHREMES._,
3263,_CHREMES._,_Men._ What say you?
3264,_CHREMES._,
3265,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._         Well, never mind. He is now no more my son.      1440"
3266,_CHREMES._,"O Menedemus, indeed he has treated me shamefully."
3267,_CHREMES._,This morning I thought your son had acted ill by you:
3268,_CHREMES._,How willingly now I’d change.
3269,_CHREMES._,
3270,_CHREMES._,_Men._                  You make too much of it.
3271,_CHREMES._,"No harm was meant; and none has been done: a foolish hoax,"
3272,_CHREMES._,And nothing more.
3273,_CHREMES._,
3274,_CHREMES._,_Chr._      You cannot hope to persuade me now
3275,_CHREMES._,There is any excuse for a son deceiving his own father.
3276,_CHREMES._,
3277,_CHREMES._,"_Men._ I think a father would find one, Chremes, where there"
3278,_CHREMES._,was none.
3279,_CHREMES._,
3280,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ Nay, nay: no more of him. I understand you came"
3281,_CHREMES._,About my daughter.
3282,_CHREMES._,
3283,_CHREMES._,_Men._       I did. Clinia asks her hand.
3284,_CHREMES._,
3285,_CHREMES._,_Chr._ You know she is not that woman they made me
3286,_CHREMES._,think....
3287,_CHREMES._,
3288,_CHREMES._,_Men._      I know.                                             1450
3289,_CHREMES._,
3290,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._ Menedemus, I never wished to have a daughter. I thought"
3291,_CHREMES._,"A girl was a burden, the worst possession a man could have;"
3292,_CHREMES._,"Costly to rear, costly to keep, costly to get rid of."
3293,_CHREMES._,"It seems I was wrong. I have had a daughter, who from her cradle"
3294,_CHREMES._,"Has never cost me a single penny, and the very hour"
3295,_CHREMES._,"She is thrown on my hands, she has offers of marriage. ’Tis not"
3296,_CHREMES._,for me
3297,_CHREMES._,To hinder the kindness of heaven. You are welcome to take her. Yet
3298,_CHREMES._,I have one condition: the dowry.
3299,_CHREMES._,
3300,_CHREMES._,_Men._                     Certainly: about that
3301,_CHREMES._,We shall not quarrel however. My son will be rich: and you      1459
3302,_CHREMES._,Will give as you think is fit.
3303,_CHREMES._,
3304,_CHREMES._,_Chr._                   I still shall insist on terms.
3305,_CHREMES._,You will not oppose a project of mine?
3306,_CHREMES._,
3307,_CHREMES._,_Men._                           I promise not;
3308,_CHREMES._,"Consider it settled: & now let us put the business off,"
3309,_CHREMES._,And bring the two young lovers happily face to face.
3310,_CHREMES._,I long to see Antiphila.
3311,_CHREMES._,
3312,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._             Wait. I’ll call my wife,            [_Goes to_ L."
3313,_CHREMES._,And tell her to bring her out.
3314,_CHREMES._,
3315,_CHREMES._,_Men._                   And I will call my son.       [_Goes to_ R.
3316,_CHREMES._,(_Calling_) Clinia!
3317,_CHREMES._,
3318,_CHREMES._,_Re-enter Clinia._
3319,_CHREMES._,
3320,_CHREMES._,_Clin._       Father!
3321,_CHREMES._,
3322,_CHREMES._,_Men._                Come! Is Pamphilus there?
3323,_CHREMES._,
3324,_CHREMES._,_Clin._                                         He is.
3325,_CHREMES._,
3326,_CHREMES._,_Men._ Let him be ready.
3327,_CHREMES._,
3328,_CHREMES._,_Enter Sostrata and Antiphila._
3329,_CHREMES._,
3330,_CHREMES._,"_Chr._             See here, Menedemus, my daughter."
3331,_CHREMES._,
3332,_CHREMES._,_Men._                                               And mine.
3333,_CHREMES._,"My dear Antiphila, I fear you have heard hard tales of me:"
3334,_CHREMES._,"I have therefore the greater pleasure in bringing you, now we meet,"
3335,_CHREMES._,The joy I have stood in the way of. I have asked your good
3336,_CHREMES._,father                                                       1470
3337,_CHREMES._,To grant your hand to my son in marriage: he has consented.
3338,_CHREMES._,"See, here is Clinia. Let me join your hands—for ever."
3339,_CHREMES._,Be happy.
3340,_CHREMES._,
3341,_SOSTRATA._,_SOSTRATA._
3342,_SOSTRATA._,
3343,_SOSTRATA._,(_Aside._) The dear old man; see how he weeps for joy.
3344,_SOSTRATA._,
3345,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._ You will not deny me now, Menedemus, I’m sure: you’ll come"
3346,_SOSTRATA._,And spend what is left of the day at my house. You will
3347,_SOSTRATA._,dine with us?
3348,_SOSTRATA._,
3349,_SOSTRATA._,_Men._ With all my heart. You have not presented me to your wife.
3350,_SOSTRATA._,I beg....
3351,_SOSTRATA._,
3352,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._ Come, Sostrata, come & make your compliments"
3353,_SOSTRATA._,To our new relation.
3354,_SOSTRATA._,
3355,_SOSTRATA._,"_Men._         Your servant, madam."
3356,_SOSTRATA._,
3357,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._                             O sir, I am glad"
3358,_SOSTRATA._,My Antiphila will have your son for a husband.
3359,_SOSTRATA._,
3360,_SOSTRATA._,_Men._                                   I am very proud
3361,_SOSTRATA._,"Of such a daughter-in-law. But now, if I may ask,"
3362,_SOSTRATA._,Where is your son Pamphilus? He should not be absent now.       1481
3363,_SOSTRATA._,
3364,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._ Don’t ask for him.
3365,_SOSTRATA._,
3366,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._             I beseech you speak with my husband, sir."
3367,_SOSTRATA._,
3368,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._ I beg, Menedemus, you’ll say no more. I have cast him off."
3369,_SOSTRATA._,
3370,_SOSTRATA._,_Men._ I still shall venture to plead his forgiveness.
3371,_SOSTRATA._,
3372,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._                                           ’Tis too late.
3373,_SOSTRATA._,I have sent him off already: he is gone.
3374,_SOSTRATA._,
3375,_SOSTRATA._,_Men._                             Not so: he is here.
3376,_SOSTRATA._,(_Calls_) Pamphilus! (_To Chremes_) Do not blame me; I promised
3377,_SOSTRATA._,to plead for him.
3378,_SOSTRATA._,
3379,_SOSTRATA._,_Enter Pamphilus._
3380,_SOSTRATA._,
3381,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._ How dare you again appear in my presence, wretch? Be off!"
3382,_SOSTRATA._,"I tell you that I disown you. Yes, Menedemus, & you"
3383,_SOSTRATA._,"Will not attempt, I beg, to avert the punishment"
3384,_SOSTRATA._,He more than deserves. I have cast him away and cut him off.    1490
3385,_SOSTRATA._,My whole fortune I leave to Antiphila—that is the thing
3386,_SOSTRATA._,I said I sh^d ask—you promised not to oppose me: now
3387,_SOSTRATA._,I beg you will not.
3388,_SOSTRATA._,
3389,_SOSTRATA._,_Men._        Consider if you are wise.
3390,_SOSTRATA._,
3391,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._                                  Not wise?
3392,_SOSTRATA._,
3393,_SOSTRATA._,_Sost._ O you are very unwise!
3394,_SOSTRATA._,
3395,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._                   Wife!
3396,_SOSTRATA._,
3397,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._                        Why, he is your son!"
3398,_SOSTRATA._,
3399,_SOSTRATA._,_Chr._ Extremely kind of you to say so! there’s not a doubt in
3400,_SOSTRATA._,the world
3401,_SOSTRATA._,"He is yours: but were I you, I sh^d not be very vain,"
3402,_SOSTRATA._,Being mirrored in such a cub.
3403,_SOSTRATA._,
3404,_SOSTRATA._,"_Sost._                 O Chremes, your own son!"
3405,_SOSTRATA._,
3406,_SOSTRATA._,"_Chr._ Not were he twice my son, and sprung from my head,"
3407,_SOSTRATA._,as they say
3408,_SOSTRATA._,"Minerva was from Jove’s, would I own him."
3409,_SOSTRATA._,
3410,_PAMPHILUS._,_PAMPHILUS._
3411,_PAMPHILUS._,
3412,_PAMPHILUS._,"Consider, sir,"
3413,_PAMPHILUS._,"My mother’s feelings, although you do not consider me.          1500"
3414,_PAMPHILUS._,
3415,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Chr._ I do not consider you, sir? In all I have done,"
3416,_PAMPHILUS._,"I have kept You and your follies in view: considering what you are,"
3417,_PAMPHILUS._,I thought you would rather think I considered you too much.
3418,_PAMPHILUS._,"I consider you reckless, sir; I consider that you pursue"
3419,_PAMPHILUS._,Your pleasure and vulgar tastes. I consider you quite unfit
3420,_PAMPHILUS._,"To be trusted with money, and so I have hit on a plan, by which"
3421,_PAMPHILUS._,"You’ll be, I consider, spared the trouble of managing it;"
3422,_PAMPHILUS._,"And though not launched on the world as I’d wish to see my son,"
3423,_PAMPHILUS._,"You’ll be, I consider, ensured from absolute destitution."
3424,_PAMPHILUS._,"Unable to leave you my wealth, I turn to those that are next,      1510"
3425,_PAMPHILUS._,"To them I do not shrink from entrusting it; and I consider,"
3426,_PAMPHILUS._,"That at their house, Pamphilus, you will always find at least"
3427,_PAMPHILUS._,"A refuge, food & clothes, & a roof above your head."
3428,_PAMPHILUS._,
3429,_PAMPHILUS._,_Pam._ Good God!
3430,_PAMPHILUS._,
3431,_PAMPHILUS._,_Chr._     Don’t swear.—’Tis better than that you should be
3432,_PAMPHILUS._,"my heir,"
3433,_PAMPHILUS._,"And Gorgo squander it. Eh, sir?"
3434,_PAMPHILUS._,
3435,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Pam._                    O, I wish I was dead."
3436,_PAMPHILUS._,
3437,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Chr._ First learn what ’tis to live: when you know that, if life"
3438,_PAMPHILUS._,"Displease you still, then wish to die."
3439,_PAMPHILUS._,
3440,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Men._                           Chremes, allow me"
3441,_PAMPHILUS._,To urge you in this. You could not really wish him to go
3442,_PAMPHILUS._,"To Persia, say, and forsake you, as Clinia díd mé."
3443,_PAMPHILUS._,
3444,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Chr._ Forsake me! why, let him go to perdition for all I care, 1520"
3445,_PAMPHILUS._,Rather than stay at home and drag his father down
3446,_PAMPHILUS._,To beggary with his vices and follies: for if I once
3447,_PAMPHILUS._,"Were saddled with his expenses, I guess ’twould come very soon"
3448,_PAMPHILUS._,"To my using that spade of yours, Menedemus, in good earnest."
3449,_PAMPHILUS._,
3450,_PAMPHILUS._,_Men._ You offered me your advice this morning; now I in turn....
3451,_PAMPHILUS._,
3452,_PAMPHILUS._,_Chr._ I do not need advice.
3453,_PAMPHILUS._,
3454,_PAMPHILUS._,_Men._                 Spoil not so happy a day.
3455,_PAMPHILUS._,
3456,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Chr._ I have found a daughter to-day, Menedemus, but lost a son."
3457,_PAMPHILUS._,
3458,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Men._ You have lost your daughter to me, let me restore your son."
3459,_PAMPHILUS._,
3460,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Sost._ O do forgive him, Chremes; you must."
3461,_PAMPHILUS._,
3462,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Chr._                                 Pray, silence, wife."
3463,_PAMPHILUS._,
3464,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Clin._ Me, sir, you cannot blame for taking a brother’s part.  1530"
3465,_PAMPHILUS._,His fault was partly mine: and what was wrongly done
3466,_PAMPHILUS._,Was done in my behalf.
3467,_PAMPHILUS._,
3468,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Chr._           No, no, there’s no excuse."
3469,_PAMPHILUS._,
3470,_PAMPHILUS._,_Enter Philolaches as a Persian._
3471,_PAMPHILUS._,
3472,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Men._ Why, here’s our friend the Persian."
3473,_PAMPHILUS._,
3474,_PAMPHILUS._,"_Chr._                               Pray, sir, what will you?"
3475,_PAMPHILUS._,
3476,_PHILOLACHES._,_PHILOLACHES._
3477,_PHILOLACHES._,
3478,_PHILOLACHES._,I hear you have been enquiring for me in the town. Behold me!
3479,_PHILOLACHES._,
3480,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._ I do not want you now: I know, sir, who you are."
3481,_PHILOLACHES._,"The game is all played out. We have done with masquerades,"
3482,_PHILOLACHES._,And personating others.
3483,_PHILOLACHES._,
3484,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._             I may take it then I address
3485,_PHILOLACHES._,"Chremes, and not Menedemus?"
3486,_PHILOLACHES._,
3487,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._                You do, sir; and be so kind"
3488,_PHILOLACHES._,"As now to restore me the money, which under a false pretence"
3489,_PHILOLACHES._,You made me give you to-day.
3490,_PHILOLACHES._,
3491,_PHILOLACHES._,_Ph._                  ’Tis not the Persian custom.             1540
3492,_PHILOLACHES._,
3493,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Chr._ You and your Persian customs be hanged, sir; and I believe"
3494,_PHILOLACHES._,You’re more than half to blame for all the impertinence
3495,_PHILOLACHES._,I have suffered to-day.
3496,_PHILOLACHES._,
3497,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Ph._             I am, sir; I came to make the confession;"
3498,_PHILOLACHES._,"But if you know it already, why do you spite your son?"
3499,_PHILOLACHES._,"I have been your guest to-day, & if I have overstrained"
3500,_PHILOLACHES._,"The liberty of the feast, I am ready in turn to pay"
3501,_PHILOLACHES._,"The penalty. In the name of Bacchus, disown and cast off me,"
3502,_PHILOLACHES._,"Disinherit me if you will. But him, your flesh & blood,"
3503,_PHILOLACHES._,Pity and forgive.
3504,_PHILOLACHES._,
3505,_PHILOLACHES._,"_Men._         Yes, Chremes."
3506,_PHILOLACHES._,
3507,_ANTIPHILA._,_ANTIPHILA._
3508,_ANTIPHILA._,
3509,_ANTIPHILA._,"O father, do give in!"
3510,_ANTIPHILA._,
3511,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Chr._ Now that’s the first time, lass, you have called me father."
3512,_ANTIPHILA._,I see                                                        1550
3513,_ANTIPHILA._,I shall have to yield.
3514,_ANTIPHILA._,
3515,_ANTIPHILA._,_Ant._           O thank you.
3516,_ANTIPHILA._,
3517,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Chr._                        Stay. If I do give in,"
3518,_ANTIPHILA._,’Tis only on two conditions.
3519,_ANTIPHILA._,
3520,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Men._                 I’ll answer for Pamphilus,"
3521,_ANTIPHILA._,That he’ll accept them: what are they?
3522,_ANTIPHILA._,
3523,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Chr._                           First, my forty pounds;"
3524,_ANTIPHILA._,To get that back from Gorgo.
3525,_ANTIPHILA._,
3526,_ANTIPHILA._,_Pam._                 I can’t do that.
3527,_ANTIPHILA._,
3528,_ANTIPHILA._,_Chr._                                  You can’t?
3529,_ANTIPHILA._,
3530,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Men._ You spent that money, Chremes, advanced it rather for me,"
3531,_ANTIPHILA._,Thinking to do me a service. I’ll ask you let it be me
3532,_ANTIPHILA._,Who does it for you. I’ll gladly pay it: it is not lost.
3533,_ANTIPHILA._,Consider this condition fulfilled.
3534,_ANTIPHILA._,
3535,_ANTIPHILA._,_Chr._                       You are kinder far
3536,_ANTIPHILA._,To my boy than he has deserved.
3537,_ANTIPHILA._,
3538,_ANTIPHILA._,_Men._                    And what is the other matter?
3539,_ANTIPHILA._,
3540,_ANTIPHILA._,_Chr._ This. He must marry.
3541,_ANTIPHILA._,
3542,_ANTIPHILA._,_Pam._                Father!
3543,_ANTIPHILA._,
3544,_ANTIPHILA._,_Chr._                        I will not hear a word.           1560
3545,_ANTIPHILA._,
3546,_ANTIPHILA._,_Men._ I’ll vouch for him that he will do it.
3547,_ANTIPHILA._,
3548,_ANTIPHILA._,_Chr._                                  He does not say so himself.
3549,_ANTIPHILA._,
3550,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Pam._ No use,—impossible."
3551,_ANTIPHILA._,
3552,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Sost._               Can you hesitate, Pamphilus?"
3553,_ANTIPHILA._,
3554,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Chr._ Nay, let him do as he likes."
3555,_ANTIPHILA._,
3556,_ANTIPHILA._,_Men._                        He’ll do it—everything.
3557,_ANTIPHILA._,
3558,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Sost._ This must seem strange at first & disagreeable,"
3559,_ANTIPHILA._,"Before you have even thought of it. When you know more of it,"
3560,_ANTIPHILA._,You’ll like it.
3561,_ANTIPHILA._,
3562,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Pam._    I will, father."

3564,_ANTIPHILA._,_Chr._                    Good! son: for though a wife
3565,_ANTIPHILA._,"Is an evil, she is a necessary evil, and one to which"
3566,_ANTIPHILA._,You will get accustomed in time. ’Tis more respectable too
3567,_ANTIPHILA._,To be married; and the only cure for a temper such as yours.
3568,_ANTIPHILA._,
3569,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Sost._ I’ll help you choose, my dear Pamphilus; I know who—    1570"
3570,_ANTIPHILA._,"That clever, charming girl, whom you’ll be in love with directly;"
3571,_ANTIPHILA._,"The orphan niece of our old neighbour, Phanocrates."
3572,_ANTIPHILA._,
3573,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Pam._ What, not that red-haired thing, with a mouth from"
3574,_ANTIPHILA._,"ear to ear,"
3575,_ANTIPHILA._,And a little knob of a nose. I couldn’t.
3576,_ANTIPHILA._,
3577,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Chr._                             Why, only see"
3578,_ANTIPHILA._,How nice he has grown: it’s plain he means what he says now.
3579,_ANTIPHILA._,
3580,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Sost._ Why, I’m sure, Pamphilus, she is a pinnacle of perfection."
3581,_ANTIPHILA._,But I know another.
3582,_ANTIPHILA._,
3583,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Pam._        No, no; if I am to marry, be hanged!"
3584,_ANTIPHILA._,I’ll choose for myself. I know of a girl will do very well.
3585,_ANTIPHILA._,
3586,_ANTIPHILA._,_Sost._ Who is it?
3587,_ANTIPHILA._,
3588,_ANTIPHILA._,_Pam._       Archonides’ daughter.
3589,_ANTIPHILA._,
3590,_ANTIPHILA._,_Sost._                            You c^d not have pleased me more.
3591,_ANTIPHILA._,
3592,_ANTIPHILA._,_Chr._ My word! I do believe my wife & I are agreed
3593,_ANTIPHILA._,On something at last. O wonderful day!
3594,_ANTIPHILA._,
3595,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Sost._                          Chremes, I knew                1581"
3596,_ANTIPHILA._,’Twould end like this.
3597,_ANTIPHILA._,
3598,_ANTIPHILA._,"_Chr._           Now, wife! none of your prophecies."
3599,_ANTIPHILA._,"Come in, come all to dinner."
3600,_ANTIPHILA._,
3601,_ANTIPHILA._,_Pam._                 Philolaches was asked;
3602,_ANTIPHILA._,May he come too?
3603,_ANTIPHILA._,
3604,_ANTIPHILA._,_Chr._     Oh yes! if it’s the Persian custom.
3605,_ANTIPHILA._,"I’ll bear no grudge to-day; come in, sir, with the rest,"
3606,_ANTIPHILA._,And help to make us merry. This is THE FEAST OF BACCHUS.

3693,_PRISCUS._,"I have seen thine eye grow steadier, and thy smile"

3698,_PRISCUS._,Which ripen’d manners clothe in rich reserve.
3699,_PRISCUS._,
3700,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._ What wilt thou say?
3701,_PRISCUS._,
3702,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._              Hearken! ’tis some days since
3703,_PRISCUS._,I have noted thy disturbance and rejoiced.
3704,_PRISCUS._,"’Tis ill with them, who quake not at the touch"

3712,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._ Her name is the oath whereby I seal all truth.
3713,_PRISCUS._,
3714,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._ And well: thou’rt worthy of her; in saying which
3715,_PRISCUS._,"I mean thy praise, for she is worthy of thée."

3723,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._                    Good Thrasea,"
3724,_PRISCUS._,"I know not how to thank thee; but, forgive me,"

3729,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._                       Nay, sir."
3730,_PRISCUS._,"Of late I have passed my life half in a dungeon,"
3731,_PRISCUS._,"Half in the garden, where thou bidst me forth"
3732,_PRISCUS._,To bask in my love’s joy: which in my duty
3733,_PRISCUS._,"I had spoken of to thee openly, but all"
3734,_PRISCUS._,"Hath come so quickly: now, a happier way,"
3735,_PRISCUS._,I meet thy favour unsolicited.
3736,_PRISCUS._,Let nothing vex this hour; I long to hear
3737,_PRISCUS._,"Thy one requirement, which my full consent"

3741,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._   ’Tis but a form. I ask
3742,_PRISCUS._,"A promise of thee, Priscus, that thou wílt not"
3743,_PRISCUS._,For ten years join any conspiracy
3744,_PRISCUS._,Against the Emperor.
3745,_PRISCUS._,
3746,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._          Why?
3747,_PRISCUS._,
3748,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._              For Fannia’s sake,"
3749,_PRISCUS._,Lest Nero kill thee: and for thy sake too.
3750,_PRISCUS._,
3751,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._ And why ten years?
3752,_PRISCUS._,
3753,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._             Ten years is a fair term.
3754,_PRISCUS._,Thou wilt be old in prudence then.
3755,_PRISCUS._,
3756,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._                        Such prudence
3757,_PRISCUS._,"Let me die ere I learn. How would’st thou, sir,"
3758,_PRISCUS._,For ten years bind me down in slavery
3759,_PRISCUS._,To flatter a tyrant?
3760,_PRISCUS._,
3761,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._         Who said flatter? Stay:

3763,_PRISCUS._,"Since Burrus died, Nero hath broken loose:—"
3764,_PRISCUS._,Seneca’s leading-string hath snapped in the midst
3765,_PRISCUS._,Without a strain:—in greed of absolute power
3766,_PRISCUS._,His will cast off restraint; in the possession
3767,_PRISCUS._,"His tottering reason doth the like. His lust,"
3768,_PRISCUS._,"His cruelty, his effeminate, blundering passion"
3769,_PRISCUS._,For art and brutal vice are but the brag
3770,_PRISCUS._,"Of a hideous nature, which will force the bounds"
3771,_PRISCUS._,"Of human action, till the shames of Rome"
3772,_PRISCUS._,Shame shameless Rome to wipe away her shame.
3773,_PRISCUS._,"That is a balance which I cannot poise,"
3774,_PRISCUS._,How much shame Rome will bear; but when I hear
3775,_PRISCUS._,"The whispers of revolt, and now one name"
3776,_PRISCUS._,And now another cast out like a fly
3777,_PRISCUS._,"To fish opinion, I give little heed,"
3778,_PRISCUS._,"For these two reasons; first, there’s not a man"
3779,_PRISCUS._,Among the chiefs of faction of such mark
3780,_PRISCUS._,"As to make change secure: the second, this,"
3781,_PRISCUS._,That lacking such a leader there’s no party
3782,_PRISCUS._,"That can command opinion. Nero’s fall,"
3783,_PRISCUS._,"When he shall fall, will be in a flooding wave"
3784,_PRISCUS._,Of common judgment. What the extravagance
3785,_PRISCUS._,"Of crime is weak to move, some unforeseen"
3786,_PRISCUS._,And trifling circumstance may on a sudden                         75
3787,_PRISCUS._,Deliver; and the force that none can raise
3788,_PRISCUS._,"None shall control. Await the rising tide,"
3789,_PRISCUS._,It will not need us.
3790,_PRISCUS._,
3791,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._          Some, sir, cannot wait."
3792,_PRISCUS._,I came to tell thee how I had given my name
3793,_PRISCUS._,To a conspiracy.
3794,_PRISCUS._,
3795,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._     The gods forbid!
3796,_PRISCUS._,With whom?

3798,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._      I may not name their names.

3800,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._                           Nay, nay:"
3801,_PRISCUS._,But who is the pretender?
3802,_PRISCUS._,
3803,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._               Seneca.
3804,_PRISCUS._,
3805,_PRISCUS._,_Thr._ Seneca! Seneca! Hath he consented?
3806,_PRISCUS._,
3807,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._ We are such, sir, as can win him."
3808,_PRISCUS._,
3809,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._                            Why, I know you;"
3810,_PRISCUS._,"The senatorial patriots. There’ll be Lucan,"
3811,_PRISCUS._,"Cassius and Lateranus, Fænius Rufus,"
3812,_PRISCUS._,"Flavus, perhaps Vestinus...."
3813,_PRISCUS._,
3814,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._                  Who they be
3815,_PRISCUS._,Will presently be seen.
3816,_PRISCUS._,
3817,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._            O, I am in time"
3818,_PRISCUS._,"To stay you yet. This plot is merely mischief,"
3819,_PRISCUS._,Seneca’s death.
3820,_PRISCUS._,
3821,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._     Not if ’tis Nero’s death.
3822,_PRISCUS._,
3823,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._ Think, man! If first ye go to Seneca,"
3824,_PRISCUS._,"Ere ye slay Nero, he will not consent:"
3825,_PRISCUS._,"Never, be sure. And if ye first slay Nero,"
3826,_PRISCUS._,"Seneca’s nowhere. Others will spring up,"
3827,_PRISCUS._,"Piso, and all the Augustan family,"
3828,_PRISCUS._,"Plautus, Silanus...."
3829,_PRISCUS._,
3830,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._          But if Seneca
3831,_PRISCUS._,Consent....
3832,_PRISCUS._,
3833,_PRISCUS._,_Thr_.      What! to that crime?
3834,_PRISCUS._,
3835,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._                      He hath consented
3836,_PRISCUS._,To like before.
3837,_PRISCUS._,
3838,_PRISCUS._,"_Thr._    Well, but the wrongs he hath done"
3839,_PRISCUS._,"His pride alloys, or in pretensed retirement"
3840,_PRISCUS._,"Repudiates; ánd, could he feel his guilt,                        100"
3841,_PRISCUS._,"That were remorse, whose sick and painful palsy"
3842,_PRISCUS._,"Cannot raise hand to strike. Think you that he,"
3843,_PRISCUS._,Who laughed at Claudius’ death; who let be slain
3844,_PRISCUS._,His old friend and protectress Agrippina;
3845,_PRISCUS._,Who glozed the murder of Britannicus;
3846,_PRISCUS._,Who hid his protest when Octavia fell;
3847,_PRISCUS._,"That he will turn about and say, ‘Such things"
3848,_PRISCUS._,"I did for Nero, and the good of Rome:"
3849,_PRISCUS._,"Now, since he sings at Naples on the stage,"
3850,_PRISCUS._,"I do repent me, and will kill my pupil;"
3851,_PRISCUS._,"Will take myself the power I made for him,"
3852,_PRISCUS._,And shew how I intended he should rule!’
3853,_PRISCUS._,This were a Roman but not Seneca.

3927,_EPICHARIS._,"_Pro._ And fill for me, fair hostess. Wilt not thou come aboard my ship?"
3928,_EPICHARIS._,
3929,_EPICHARIS._,"_Ep._ Your ship, my lord?"
3930,_EPICHARIS._,
3931,_EPICHARIS._,_Pro._ ’Tis against the rules of the service: but they provide not for
3932,_EPICHARIS._,these earthquakes.
3933,_EPICHARIS._,
3934,_EPICHARIS._,"_Ep._ Ha! ha! you jest, my lord."
3935,_EPICHARIS._,
3936,_EPICHARIS._,_Pro._ We have no wars to occupy us: why should I not give shelter to
3937,_EPICHARIS._,"the ladies, that fear to be ashore?"
3938,_EPICHARIS._,
3939,_EPICHARIS._,"_Ep._ That would not be me, my lord. We rode out worse shakings last"

3942,_EPICHARIS._,"_Pro._ Come, I’ll have thee come. Should Cæsar hear of it, I can take"

3958,_THIRD MARINER._,Claudius’ death.
3959,_THIRD MARINER._,
3960,_THIRD MARINER._,"_1st._ True, mate; that was our Niobby. But this was a Greek lady that"
3961,_THIRD MARINER._,lost all her children at a clap; bad luck with her name!
3962,_THIRD MARINER._,
3963,_THIRD MARINER._,"_2nd._ The Emperor would have made to be her, as ’twere; was it?"
3964,_THIRD MARINER._,
3965,_THIRD MARINER._,"_1st._ ’Twas a tragedy, look: and that’s just where it is. Everybody is"
3966,_THIRD MARINER._,"somebody else, and nothing’s as it should be."
3967,_THIRD MARINER._,
3968,_THIRD MARINER._,_2nd._ That’s right: he were dressed out like a woman.
3969,_THIRD MARINER._,
3970,_THIRD MARINER._,"_1st._ Did ye not see him, nodding to the music, and throwing his hands"
3971,_THIRD MARINER._,"about? then he gets red in the face, then he should stoop down to catch"
3972,_THIRD MARINER._,"his breath, (_he acts_) then creening up again he should throw back his"

3990,_FIRST OFFICER._,_1st Off._ But how should the sea cure you? ’Tis their common plaything.
3991,_FIRST OFFICER._,
3992,_FIRST OFFICER._,"_Pro._ Indeed, sir, you would learn what heavings be. These land"
3993,_FIRST OFFICER._,movements are nought. What would you say to thirty feet up and down
3994,_FIRST OFFICER._,three times a minute? with now your bows in the air and now your stern:
3995,_FIRST OFFICER._,"pitched now forward, now backward, now rolled from side to side; thrust"

3998,_FIRST OFFICER._,
3999,_FIRST OFFICER._,"_Se^{o.}_ Maybe, sir: but the roof will not fall on your head: the"
4000,_FIRST OFFICER._,waves do not crack your walls. Your ships being constructed mainly of
4001,_FIRST OFFICER._,wood ...
4002,_FIRST OFFICER._,
4003,_FIRST OFFICER._,"_Pro._ But the rocks, sir, are mainly constructed of stone, upon which"

4005,_FIRST OFFICER._,pay his fortune down to set one foot on the most quakeful or boggy

4007,_FIRST OFFICER._,"though I have never seen them, will swallow, they say, your whole ship"

4025,_FIRST OFFICER._,
4026,_FIRST OFFICER._,"_Ep._ Sit and drink, gentlemen. Wine shall be cheap to-day. The life in"

4059,_CLITUS._,upon the seven hills.
4060,_CLITUS._,

4072,_GRIPUS._,"_Pro._ What’s gone, man?"
4073,_GRIPUS._,
4074,_GRIPUS._,"_Gri._ The theater; foundered, sir, gone clean down. I had just"

4178,_GRIPUS._,
4179,_GRIPUS._,"_Se^{o.}_ Well, if not, think what his friends might give to recover it."
4180,_GRIPUS._,
4181,_GRIPUS._,_Ep._ You should have sold it yourself and brought me the money.

4480,_FLAVUS._,"Upon an outlawed isle; that calumny,"
4481,_FLAVUS._,"Dumb in her faultless presence, might dare trumpet"

4483,_FLAVUS._,"By a clumsy soldier, ’gainst whose butcher’s knife"
4484,_FLAVUS._,"She struggled childishly, to the stony walls"

4496,_FLAVUS._,
4497,_FLAVUS._,"_Lat._ But Nero, sir, is held thy pupil, and thou"

4500,_FLAVUS._,
4501,_FLAVUS._,"_Sen._       Well, well: but Burrus’ death"
4502,_FLAVUS._,"Hath halved my power, and left the lesser half"
4503,_FLAVUS._,Helpless in isolation.
4504,_FLAVUS._,
4505,_FLAVUS._,_Lat._           That’s a fact.
4506,_FLAVUS._,"We come, my lord, to bid thee join thy hand"

4508,_FLAVUS._,"That’s now in Burrus’ place, another Burrus."
4509,_FLAVUS._,
4510,_FLAVUS._,_Sen._ Another Burrus! Fifty Rufuses
4511,_FLAVUS._,Would make no part of Burrus. Why! I am grieved
4512,_FLAVUS._,"More for his goodness, when I think of him,      500"
4513,_FLAVUS._,"Than by all Nero’s ill. My staunch friend was he,"
4514,_FLAVUS._,"Stern as a Roman, tender as a woman:"
4515,_FLAVUS._,"A simple mind, a clear head, and true heart;"
4516,_FLAVUS._,"Faithful, unblenched and certain of his path."
4517,_FLAVUS._,All that philosophy has ever taught me
4518,_FLAVUS._,"He knew by instinct, and would hit the mark"
4519,_FLAVUS._,"With careless action, where my reason fumbled"
4520,_FLAVUS._,"And groped in the dusk. I say, if all the books"
4521,_FLAVUS._,"I have ever read or writ, could make one man"
4522,_FLAVUS._,"Like Burrus, with so natural a touch,"
4523,_FLAVUS._,"And such godlike directness, none would doubt"
4524,_FLAVUS._,Of our philosophy.
4525,_FLAVUS._,
4526,_FLAVUS._,_Luc._       But now he’s gone.

4538,_FLAVUS._,"Seal your lips and depart.—And thou too, nephew,"

4540,_FLAVUS._,

4549,_FLAVUS._,Privy to your distempered plots; but rightly
4550,_FLAVUS._,Judged that I would not sacrifice your lives
4551,_FLAVUS._,To save the monster’s. Nay: were Nero’s death
4552,_FLAVUS._,"God’s will, as yours it seems, I might rejoice."
4553,_FLAVUS._,But in your scheme to whom would ye entrust
4554,_FLAVUS._,"The absolute power? If Nero be pulled down,"
4555,_FLAVUS._,Whom would ye bid us worship? The empire needs
4556,_FLAVUS._,"A god,—or, if not that, a godlike man,"
4557,_FLAVUS._,Plato’s philosopher for king.
4558,_FLAVUS._,
4559,_FLAVUS._,_Lat._                  Agreed!
4560,_FLAVUS._,"’Tis a philosopher we have chosen, sir.      530"

4565,_FLAVUS._,_Sen._             Hey! Is’t Thrasea
4566,_FLAVUS._,Ye would make emperor?
4567,_FLAVUS._,
4568,_FLAVUS._,_Luc._           Thrasea hath no wealth
4569,_FLAVUS._,Nor favour with the people.
4570,_FLAVUS._,
4571,_FLAVUS._,_Sen._                Who is’t then
4572,_FLAVUS._,That leads your dream a-dance?
4573,_FLAVUS._,
4574,_FLAVUS._,"_Lat._                   Sir, ’tis no dream."
4575,_FLAVUS._,

4588,_FLAVUS._,"_Sen._ Me! madmen, me! Cæsar! me! I am retired ..."
4589,_FLAVUS._,And—oh! no—never. Who hath chosen me?
4590,_FLAVUS._,"Is this thy folly, nephew, when thou tell’st me"
4591,_FLAVUS._,My friends decrease?
4592,_FLAVUS._,
4593,_FLAVUS._,_Luc._         I said the truth: ’tis time
4594,_FLAVUS._,Thou rise and rally them. We have a party.
4595,_FLAVUS._,
4596,_FLAVUS._,_Sen._ I have no party.
4597,_FLAVUS._,
4598,_FLAVUS._,_Luc._            We may count for yours
4599,_FLAVUS._,All the republicans. Your oratory
4600,_FLAVUS._,"Will win the senate, and your wealth the people."
4601,_FLAVUS._,"Rufus is ours, and brings the guards; Vestinus,"
4602,_FLAVUS._,"The consul, ours; here’s Lateranus with us,"
4603,_FLAVUS._,The consul designate; at Nero’s death
4604,_FLAVUS._,Corbulo and the eastern army... ’Tis no party:

4609,_FLAVUS._,
4610,_FLAVUS._,"_Luc._ Nero once slain, ’tis needful for the hour"

4637,_PRISCUS._,"Thou wouldst hide from me, for some petty scruple,"

4639,_PRISCUS._,
4640,_PRISCUS._,_Pr._                     I should tell:—

4643,_PRISCUS._,_Sen._              And he said right.
4644,_PRISCUS._,I do refuse.

4654,_PRISCUS._,
4655,_PRISCUS._,_Luc._                      Thou wilt nót?
4656,_PRISCUS._,Wilt nót throne virtue in the seat of might?
4657,_PRISCUS._,Not crown philosophy? and in thyself
4658,_PRISCUS._,"Fulfil the dream of wisdom, which the world"
4659,_PRISCUS._,Hath mocked at as impracticable?
4660,_PRISCUS._,
4661,_PRISCUS._,"_Sen._                     Yea,"
4662,_PRISCUS._,And yet shall mock. ’Tis not for me. Ye think
4663,_PRISCUS._,"Because I am rich, that I despise not wealth;"
4664,_PRISCUS._,"Because I have been involved in courtly faction,"
4665,_PRISCUS._,"I loathe not crime; that what ye have seen to touch me,"
4666,_PRISCUS._,Thát I would handle. Can ye thus mistake me?
4667,_PRISCUS._,"And deem that I, being such an one to serve you,"
4668,_PRISCUS._,"Might be entrapped with flattery,—that ye style me"
4669,_PRISCUS._,"The one man worthy? ay, to rule the world"
4670,_PRISCUS._,Ye said: Well! I shall rule it; but not so.
4671,_PRISCUS._,"I make my throne here, and with these nibbed reeds"
4672,_PRISCUS._,"Issue my edicts to the simple-hearted,"
4673,_PRISCUS._,"To whom all rule shall come: Yes, it shall come"
4674,_PRISCUS._,If God’s will count for aught.
4675,_PRISCUS._,
4676,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._                    My lord, consider."
4677,_PRISCUS._,This is the hour to set you right for ever.
4678,_PRISCUS._,’Twas of your doing Nero came to power:      590
4679,_PRISCUS._,Now with one word you may blot out the past.

4681,_PRISCUS._,"_Sen._ Priscus, if thou didst think I was to blame"
4682,_PRISCUS._,"For all the wrongs and crimes, which by thy speech"
4683,_PRISCUS._,"Thou wouldst impute, wouldst thou be here to-day"
4684,_PRISCUS._,To hail me Cæsar? ’Tis a stingless taunt.
4685,_PRISCUS._,
4686,_PRISCUS._,_Lat._ Thou shalt not be reproached.

4693,_PRISCUS._,
4694,_PRISCUS._,"_Lat._ Sir, you mistake: we ask not your consent"
4695,_PRISCUS._,Unto the deed.
4696,_PRISCUS._,

4698,_PRISCUS._,

4700,_PRISCUS._,Wilt thou be Cæsar?
4701,_PRISCUS._,
4702,_PRISCUS._,"_Sen._        No, sir: I will not."
4703,_PRISCUS._,
4704,_PRISCUS._,_Fla._ Thou wilt not change thy books for provinces?
4705,_PRISCUS._,
4706,_PRISCUS._,"_Sen._ No, sir."
4707,_PRISCUS._,

4712,_PRISCUS._,"_Fla._ My lord, allow me."
4713,_PRISCUS._,
4714,_PRISCUS._,_Luc._              Hear what I would say.
4715,_PRISCUS._,
4716,_PRISCUS._,"_Sen._ I know it, nephew, afore. Now let this end."
4717,_PRISCUS._,’Tis said.
4718,_PRISCUS._,
4719,_PRISCUS._,"_Pr._ I was prepared, my lord, for this:"
4720,_PRISCUS._,And we at least may spare you further danger
4721,_PRISCUS._,Of our suspicious conference. I go.      (_Moving._)
4722,_PRISCUS._,
4723,_PRISCUS._,_Sen._ The ill is done.
4724,_PRISCUS._,
4725,_PRISCUS._,_Fla._            One word. Nero must die;
4726,_PRISCUS._,And whosoe’er but thou steps in his place                        610
4727,_PRISCUS._,Must also die; for none is worthy. Come
4728,_PRISCUS._,"At once, ere more be slain. This ends not here."
4729,_PRISCUS._,
4730,_PRISCUS._,_Sen._ Thou dost say right: this ends not here: if more
4731,_PRISCUS._,"Shall die, thou bearest some blame of it. Farewell!"
4732,_PRISCUS._,"God can bend all to good: this, which to me"
4733,_PRISCUS._,"Seems ill, may not be so."

4736,_PRISCUS._,
4737,_PRISCUS._,"_Sen._ Indeed fear not. Now, for my safety & yours,"
4738,_PRISCUS._,"Leave me, I pray. Farewell!"
4739,_PRISCUS._,
4740,_PRISCUS._,_All_ (_going_).            Farewell!                    [_Exeunt._

4743,_PRISCUS._,"Seneca, Cæsar? My hand is trembling, my sense"
4744,_PRISCUS._,"Swimming: ’tis true: my mortal stroke, & dealt me"
4745,_PRISCUS._,"By would-be friends. The way that least I expected,"
4746,_PRISCUS._,When I least looked for it—yea—thus cometh Death.

4750,_PRISCUS._,"Dangles upon the hook, and I refuse."
4751,_PRISCUS._,"I would not; nay, I could not ... What then do?"
4752,_PRISCUS._,"Stand firm? with my poor palsied limbs,"
4753,_PRISCUS._,"Stand firm? budge not a hair, as Burrus put it?                  630"
4754,_PRISCUS._,—So take rank in the monster’s tale of murders:

4757,_PRISCUS._,"His hypocritical smile, his three or four"

4763,_PRISCUS._,That may well be: That I’ll do: all my skill
4764,_PRISCUS._,"Summon to aid me: else ’tis my death,—the end:"

5012,_VATINIUS._,_Vat._                              I wonder
5013,_VATINIUS._,None ever thought of it before.
5014,_VATINIUS._,
5015,_VATINIUS._,_Ner._                    Tut! fool;
5016,_VATINIUS._,That is the greatness: ’tis the common thing
5017,_VATINIUS._,For man to beat about. True genius
5018,_VATINIUS._,Is but simplicity: all great inventions
5019,_VATINIUS._,Seem first devices.
5020,_VATINIUS._,
5021,_VATINIUS._,_Tig._        ’Tis a revolution.
5022,_VATINIUS._,
5023,_VATINIUS._,_Ner._ Just so: in ethics as in politics.
5024,_VATINIUS._,I let the world wag as it will; and if
5025,_VATINIUS._,"The world mistake its will, then I am Cæsar"
5026,_VATINIUS._,To wag it.
5027,_VATINIUS._,
5028,_VATINIUS._,"_Vat._     Here’s a flaw, good wag; you judge"
5029,_VATINIUS._,The appetites of all men by your own:
5030,_VATINIUS._,The standard is too high.
5031,_VATINIUS._,
5032,_VATINIUS._,_Ner._              We’ll see to that;
5033,_VATINIUS._,By one experiment I’ll strangle doubt.
5034,_VATINIUS._,"This is my plan. I mean to hold a fête,"
5035,_VATINIUS._,Say at Agrippa’s pool:—the folk will need      800
5036,_VATINIUS._,Some such diversion when the fire is o’er:—
5037,_VATINIUS._,"Thither I’ll draw all Rome, with novel shows,"
5038,_VATINIUS._,"Sea-fights and monsters; round about the water,"
5039,_VATINIUS._,"Along the bank, I shall have wine-booths set,"
5040,_VATINIUS._,"Brilliant with luxury and enticement, wine"
5041,_VATINIUS._,Gratis; and to all comers night and day
5042,_VATINIUS._,They shall stand open. Now I’ll have these booths
5043,_VATINIUS._,Kept by the Roman ladies:—that’s my plan.
5044,_VATINIUS._,"They shall have license, everything permitted"
5045,_VATINIUS._,"But interference. We will watch our Trojans,"
5046,_VATINIUS._,How they conduct themselves.
5047,_VATINIUS._,
5048,_VATINIUS._,_Vat._                 This is simplicity.
5049,_VATINIUS._,
5050,_VATINIUS._,_Ner._ (_aside to Tig._). And mark the disaffected.
5051,_VATINIUS._,
5052,_VATINIUS._,_Tig._ (_aside_).                                   Here’s a trap
5053,_VATINIUS._,To catch all but the vermin.
5054,_VATINIUS._,
5055,_VATINIUS._,_Sce._                 A grand invention.
5056,_VATINIUS._,
5057,_VATINIUS._,"_Ner._ The details, my good master, are for you:"
5058,_VATINIUS._,Our three friends here may help.
5059,_VATINIUS._,
5060,_VATINIUS._,"_Sce., Se^{o.} and Qu._ (_bowing_). Our humble thanks."
5061,_VATINIUS._,
5062,_VATINIUS._,_Enter a Servant._
5063,_VATINIUS._,
5064,_VATINIUS._,_Ner._ (_to Servant_). What is it?
5065,_VATINIUS._,
5066,_SERVANT._,_SERVANT._
5067,_SERVANT._,
5068,_SERVANT._,"Lord Seneca is in attendance, sire."
5069,_SERVANT._,
5070,_SERVANT._,_Tig._ (_to Ner._). Send the old man home to his wife.
5071,_SERVANT._,
5072,_SERVANT._,_Ner._                            What can he come for?
5073,_SERVANT._,
5074,_SERVANT._,_Vat._ Is’t not the hour for lessons?
5075,_SERVANT._,
5076,_SERVANT._,_Ner._                          Now what say you
5077,_SERVANT._,"To have him in, and make him of your council"
5078,_SERVANT._,For the ordering of the fête (_To Serv._) Go shew
5079,_SERVANT._,him here.                                       [_Exit Servant._
5080,_SERVANT._,
5081,_SERVANT._,"_Tig._ (_aside to Nero_). Jest not with this man, Cæsar;"
5082,_SERVANT._,Thrasea and he
5083,_SERVANT._,Are your worst enemies.
5084,_SERVANT._,
5085,_SERVANT._,_Ner._            Mighty enemies!
5086,_SERVANT._,
5087,_SERVANT._,_Tig._ If there were no pretenders.
5088,_SERVANT._,
5089,_SERVANT._,_Ner._                        What do you mean?
5090,_SERVANT._,
5091,_SERVANT._,"_Tig._ (_apart with Nero_). My only pleasure is thy service, Cæsar:"
5092,_SERVANT._,"If ’tis thy will that Tigellinus die,"
5093,_SERVANT._,I’ll be thy sacrifice and welcome death.
5094,_SERVANT._,"The mob shall tear me, as they tore Sejanus,"
5095,_SERVANT._,And tread my mangled corpse on Tiber’s steps:
5096,_SERVANT._,"But pardon Nature’s shudderings, they come"
5097,_SERVANT._,At sound of these men’s names.
5098,_SERVANT._,
5099,_SERVANT._,"_Ner._                   Why, know you not"
5100,_SERVANT._,"I am reconciled with Thrasea, since I put      831"
5101,_SERVANT._,His motion to the senate? While he lets me
5102,_SERVANT._,"Go my way, he goes his."
5103,_SERVANT._,
5104,_SERVANT._,_Tig._            And Seneca?
5105,_SERVANT._,
5106,_SERVANT._,_Ner._                        Pooh!
5107,_SERVANT._,
5108,_SERVANT._,"_Tig._ Cæsar said well these men were not to fear,"
5109,_SERVANT._,If there were no pretenders.
5110,_SERVANT._,
5111,_SERVANT._,_Ner._                 What pretenders?
5112,_SERVANT._,
5113,_SERVANT._,_Tig._ Sylla and Plautus are the first to name.
5114,_SERVANT._,
5115,_SERVANT._,_Ner._ Both are retired from Rome.
5116,_SERVANT._,
5117,_SERVANT._,"_Tig._                       And whither, Cæsar?"
5118,_SERVANT._,"Mark you that Sylla is retired to Gaul,"
5119,_SERVANT._,Fire to the tinderbox: those doughty legions
5120,_SERVANT._,Forget not how they crossed the Rubicon.
5121,_SERVANT._,"And where is Plautus? close by Corbulo,"
5122,_SERVANT._,"Whose army is a créature of díscipline,"
5123,_SERVANT._,To serve him as his fingers....
5124,_SERVANT._,
5125,_SERVANT._,"_Ner._ Corbulo, now! my prince of generals,"
5126,_SERVANT._,Rome’s trusty dexter arm.
5127,_SERVANT._,
5128,_SERVANT._,_Tig._              Trust not that giant!
5129,_SERVANT._,Nature packed not his mighty body full
5130,_SERVANT._,Of intrepidity for nought. I well
5131,_SERVANT._,"Remember when I sat by him at supper,"
5132,_SERVANT._,The day he took his baton; how his triumph
5133,_SERVANT._,Was undisguised; and whén Cæsar was mentioned—
5134,_SERVANT._,You happed to have won a horse-race....
5135,_SERVANT._,
5136,_SERVANT._,_Ner._                            And what said he?
5137,_SERVANT._,
5138,_SERVANT._,"_Tig._ No word, else had I told it; he but hemmed:"
5139,_SERVANT._,But the couch shook. In his big iron chest
5140,_SERVANT._,"A thunder rumbled, such as Jove might make"
5141,_SERVANT._,If he found Juno faithless.
5142,_SERVANT._,
5143,_SERVANT._,"_Ner._                Ha, ha, ha!"
5144,_SERVANT._,"He’ll crunch us, think you, master? But this Sylla"
5145,_SERVANT._,"Is poor as a rat: and Plautus, if he is wealthy,"
5146,_SERVANT._,Lives moderately.
5147,_SERVANT._,
5148,_SERVANT._,_Tig._      Poor men are poor in scruples:
5149,_SERVANT._,"And rich men that live moderately, be sure,"
5150,_SERVANT._,Hide some rich purpose.
5151,_SERVANT._,
5152,_SERVANT._,"_Ner._            Had these men a purpose,"
5153,_SERVANT._,It would be bruited.
5154,_SERVANT._,
5155,_SERVANT._,_Tig._         It is bruited.
5156,_SERVANT._,
5157,_SERVANT._,_Ner._                        Ha!      861
5158,_SERVANT._,That’s so?
5159,_SERVANT._,
5160,_SERVANT._,"_Tig._     ’Tis also hoped that, being a pair,"
5161,_SERVANT._,The one may fight the other and both be slain.
5162,_SERVANT._,
5163,_SERVANT._,"_Ner._ That is a trouble we can spare them, master:"
5164,_SERVANT._,"That were a pity.—I thank you, Tigellinus:—"
5165,_SERVANT._,"Take you the order for their deaths; but mind,"
5166,_SERVANT._,"Secretly, secretly. Here’s Seneca."
5167,_SERVANT._,
5168,_SERVANT._,"_Enter Seneca._ (_Scevinus, Senecio and Quintian still stand aside._)"
5169,_SERVANT._,
5170,_SERVANT._,"_Tig._ (_aside_). Two of my foes wiped out; now, Mister Seneca,"
5171,_SERVANT._,I take you next.
5172,_SERVANT._,
5173,_SERVANT._,"_Ner._ Good Seneca, what wouldst thou?"
5174,_SERVANT._,
5175,_SENECA._,_SENECA._
5176,_SENECA._,
5177,_SENECA._,"Cæsar, I ask"
5178,_SENECA._,A private interview.
5179,_SENECA._,
5180,_SENECA._,_Ner._         ’Tis private here:
5181,_SENECA._,This is my privy-council.
5182,_SENECA._,
5183,_SENECA._,_Vat._              Rome’s triumvirate.
5184,_SENECA._,"Ha, ha! we rule the world!      (_Tableau._)"
5185,_SENECA._,"(_Gesturing._)   Come, trust thy secret"
5186,_SENECA._,"In Cæsar’s ear, my lord."
5187,_SENECA._,
5188,_SENECA._,_Se^{o.}_ (_aside to Sce._). Let us make up
5189,_SENECA._,To Seneca by going out.
5190,_SENECA._,
5191,_SENECA._,_Sen._ As Cæsar wills.
5192,_SENECA._,
5193,_SENECA._,_Sce._ (_to Nero_).    Cæsar’s august permission!
5194,_SENECA._,We are not stoics.
5195,_SENECA._,
5196,_SENECA._,"_Ner._       I understand you, sir:"
5197,_SENECA._,You may withdraw.
5198,_SENECA._,
5199,_SENECA._,"_Sce., Se^{o.} and Qu._ Our humble thanks."
5200,_SENECA._,
5201,_SENECA._,"[_Exeunt, bowing separately to Nero and Seneca._"
5202,_SENECA._,
5203,_SENECA._,_Ner._ Now we are private.
5204,_SENECA._,
5205,_SENECA._,_Sen._               If your majesty
5206,_SENECA._,"Will lend me attention, I will put my business"
5207,_SENECA._,Shortly.
5208,_SENECA._,
5209,_SENECA._,_Ner._ I shall not interrupt.
5210,_SENECA._,
5211,_SENECA._,_Vat._                  Nor I;                                   880
5212,_SENECA._,Unless I snore. (_Sits._)
5213,_SENECA._,
5214,_SENECA._,"_Sen._ ’Tis fourteen years, Cæsar, since I was first"
5215,_SENECA._,Chosen your guide; and for eight years and more
5216,_SENECA._,You have governed the empire not without my aid.
5217,_SENECA._,Through all w^h time your kindness hath heaped ón me
5218,_SENECA._,"So many dignities and so much wealth,"
5219,_SENECA._,That nothing wants to my felicity
5220,_SENECA._,Save some curtailment of it.—I can allege
5221,_SENECA._,"Precedents for my conduct: the divine Augustus,"
5222,_SENECA._,"Who was your great-great-grandfather, permitted"
5223,_SENECA._,Marcus Agrippa to withdraw himself
5224,_SENECA._,To Mitylenè and a private life:
5225,_SENECA._,"Mæcenas too he let abide in Rome,"
5226,_SENECA._,"As in a foreign country, at his ease;—"
5227,_SENECA._,"Whereof the one had served in all his wars,"
5228,_SENECA._,The other toiled at home; and each grown rich
5229,_SENECA._,With presents answerable to their high deserts.
5230,_SENECA._,"As for myself, what I have done to merit"
5231,_SENECA._,"Your prodigal favour,—being but a student,"
5232,_SENECA._,"A teacher, a philosopher,—I say not:                             900"
5233,_SENECA._,"But being enriched, it comforteth my mind"
5234,_SENECA._,’Twas not for me to strive against your gifts.
5235,_SENECA._,"Both of us, sire, have filled our measure, you"
5236,_SENECA._,"In giving all a prince should give a friend,"
5237,_SENECA._,I taking what a friend might from a prince.
5238,_SENECA._,"But now, sire, in my journey of life grown old,"
5239,_SENECA._,The business of my riches burdens me.
5240,_SENECA._,And ’tis by envy augmented; which if you
5241,_SENECA._,"Be set above the sting of, yet ’tis known"
5242,_SENECA._,"What curse to peace it is. Wherefore I pray,"
5243,_SENECA._,Let me retire. I crave your helping hand
5244,_SENECA._,To ease me of my wealth: that I restore
5245,_SENECA._,"Whence first I had it, to yourself: receive it,"
5246,_SENECA._,"I pray you, as your own. You, in your flower,"
5247,_SENECA._,"May serve your generation, and permit"
5248,_SENECA._,Your old friends to betake themselves to rest.
5249,_SENECA._,"’Twill be your praise, sire, to have enriched such men"
5250,_SENECA._,As could live happy in a mean estate.
5251,_SENECA._,
5252,_SENECA._,_Tig._ (_half aside_). There’s something behind this.
5253,_SENECA._,
5254,_SENECA._,"_Ner._ (_to Tig._).                                   Silence, I bid!"
5255,_SENECA._,
5256,_SENECA._,"(_To Sen._) If, Seneca, I am able out of hand"
5257,_SENECA._,To meet thy long premeditated speech
5258,_SENECA._,"With equal answer, that I owe to thee,"
5259,_SENECA._,And thine instruction.—First thou didst allege
5260,_SENECA._,Mæcenas and Agrippa: but from them
5261,_SENECA._,Divine Augustus took not back their wealth;
5262,_SENECA._,"Which if they won in danger, yet I doubt not"
5263,_SENECA._,Thy weapons and thy hand would not have wanted
5264,_SENECA._,Had I had need of them. But what I needed
5265,_SENECA._,That gavest thou; such reason and good counsel
5266,_SENECA._,As shall abide with me while my life lasteth.                    930
5267,_SENECA._,"Those goods material, which thou hadst of me,"
5268,_SENECA._,Are liable to perish; and I am shamed
5269,_SENECA._,"That thou, who art the first in my affection,"
5270,_SENECA._,"Art not first also in wealth:—nay, there be slaves"
5271,_SENECA._,"Own more than thou:—and for thine age, I know"
5272,_SENECA._,"Thou’rt lusty for thy years, and able well"
5273,_SENECA._,To enjoy thy wealth and its commodities.
5274,_SENECA._,"Keep thy rewards still, and still do us service:"
5275,_SENECA._,If slipperiness of youth be overprone
5276,_SENECA._,"To what it should not, thou mayst draw us back;"
5277,_SENECA._,And our unseemly and unruly zeal
5278,_SENECA._,"Temper with kind advice. Harked I to thee,"
5279,_SENECA._,"’Tis not thy moderation we should hear of,"
5280,_SENECA._,"Nay, nor thy ease, shouldst thou forsake our service:"
5281,_SENECA._,Rather my covetousness and thy fear
5282,_SENECA._,Would be in all men’s mouths. ’Twould ill beseem
5283,_SENECA._,"Such a philosopher as thou, at cost"
5284,_SENECA._,Of thy friend’s infamy to win thy comfort.
5285,_SENECA._,
5286,_SENECA._,"_Tig._ Hear, hear! ’Tis well said, Cæsar!"
5287,_SENECA._,
5288,_SENECA._,_Vat._                              Admirable!
5289,_SENECA._,But somewhat senecal.
5290,_SENECA._,
5291,_SENECA._,"_Ner._          Embrace me, Seneca.                              950"
5292,_SENECA._,Let us be friends.
5293,_SENECA._,
5294,_SENECA._,_Vat._       Ye gods! I shall be jealous.
5295,_SENECA._,"Me too, my lord."
5296,_SENECA._,
5297,_SENECA._,"_Sen._     If, Cæsar, in this embrace"
5298,_SENECA._,"Power kissed philosophy, ’twere well with both."
5299,_SENECA._,
5300,_SENECA._,_Ner._ I have my own philosophy to kiss;
5301,_SENECA._,Be thou content with thine.
5302,_SENECA._,
5303,_SENECA._,"_Sen._                Nay, the wise man"
5304,_SENECA._,"Is so convinced of truth, he seeks to impart it."
5305,_SENECA._,
5306,_SENECA._,_Ner._ I would impart my wisdom unto thee.
5307,_SENECA._,
5308,_SENECA._,"(_A Messenger enters and speaks to Tigellinus, who goes out with him._)"
5309,_SENECA._,
5310,_SENECA._,"_Sen._ Alas! all schools alike spew out your doctrines,"
5311,_SENECA._,Zeno or Epicurus.
5312,_SENECA._,
5313,_SENECA._,_Ner._      That is because
5314,_SENECA._,"You all agree to teach what none believes,"
5315,_SENECA._,"That pain and misery and death are nothing,"
5316,_SENECA._,"But goodness all-sufficient. Tell me, Seneca,"
5317,_SENECA._,Can a good man be happy on the rack?
5318,_SENECA._,
5319,_SENECA._,_Vat._ Not if the rack be good.
5320,_SENECA._,
5321,_SENECA._,"_Sen._                    Such questions, Cæsar,"
5322,_SENECA._,Have their fit time and place. I came to offer
5323,_SENECA._,"My wealth and counsel both; you refuse both,"
5324,_SENECA._,And let your fool mock me.—Knows he not whom
5325,_SENECA._,"Ill manners hurt, that thus he wounds his master?"
5326,_SENECA._,
5327,_SENECA._,"_Ner._ And better have no manners than be made,"
5328,_SENECA._,"As thou, of manners only. Thou affectest                         970"
5329,_SENECA._,Insensibility; thy pompous maxims
5330,_SENECA._,Of wordy wisdom thou wouldst pass for strong
5331,_SENECA._,"Because they are harsh, generous because inflated."
5332,_SENECA._,Thy rhetoric is like a mouldy cake;
5333,_SENECA._,I have eaten to loathing of it: I would no more.
5334,_SENECA._,
5335,_SENECA._,_Sen._ Look for no more. That speech delivers you.
5336,_SENECA._,Whether my words are false and empty bubbles
5337,_SENECA._,"There’s nought to show, but ’twill appear the day"
5338,_SENECA._,"When life must answer for it:—The condition,"
5339,_SENECA._,"Cæsar, I accept, and do not fear the judgment."
5340,_SENECA._,
5341,_SENECA._,[_Bows to Nero and exit._
5342,_SENECA._,
5343,_SENECA._,_Re-enter Tigellinus excitedly._
5344,_SENECA._,
5345,_SENECA._,"_Tig._ My house is burning, Cæsar!"
5346,_SENECA._,
5347,_SENECA._,_Ner._                       Well! if it be?
5348,_SENECA._,"By all the gods, vex me not now."
5349,_SENECA._,
5350,_SENECA._,_Tig._                     My house!
5351,_SENECA._,
5352,_SENECA._,"_Ner._ And what’s thy house, curse it? when half the city"
5353,_SENECA._,"Was burned to the ground, wert thou not cool? why now"
5354,_SENECA._,Fume for thy house?
5355,_SENECA._,
5356,_SENECA._,"_Tig._        Cæsar, the Vatican!"
5357,_SENECA._,
5358,_SENECA._,_Ner._ The Vatican!
5359,_SENECA._,
5360,_SENECA._,_Tig._        You may see it from the windows.
5361,_SENECA._,
5362,_SENECA._,_Ner._ (_going to window_). Then Rome will all be burned.
5363,_SENECA._,
5364,_SENECA._,_Tig._ (_aside_).                    And by thy foes.
5365,_SENECA._,"When the wínd was in the south, they fired the south:"
5366,_SENECA._,"Now it hath changed, they fire the north."
5367,_SENECA._,
5368,_SENECA._,_Ner._ (_returning_).                     ’Tis true.
5369,_SENECA._,I can do nó móre: it must búrn.
5370,_SENECA._,
5371,_SENECA._,"_Tig._                    What, sire,                            990"
5372,_SENECA._,To tell the captains? May they use discretion
5373,_SENECA._,To pull down?
5374,_SENECA._,
5375,_SENECA._,"_Ner._ Bid them change the wind, man: bid them"
5376,_SENECA._,"Snow from the south. Wóod must búrn; when ’tis burnt,"

5785,_PISO._,"_Pet._          What a fuss,"

5797,_SENECIO._,Mix in affairs again?
5798,_SENECIO._,

5803,_SENECIO._,"The world and all its fret: its vanity,"

5887,_SCEVINUS._,
5888,_SCEVINUS._,"_Luc._       Is’t not true, Petronius,"
5889,_SCEVINUS._,Thou dost hate Nero too? Thou hast held aloof

5891,_SCEVINUS._,"Thou laughest and art comfortable: ah! man,"
5892,_SCEVINUS._,"Stop well thine ears with luxury, lest thou hear"
5893,_SCEVINUS._,"The shrieks in Cæsar’s garden, where men burn"
5894,_SCEVINUS._,To light his revels up.
5895,_SCEVINUS._,
5896,_SCEVINUS._,"_Se^{o.}_         Ay, burned alive,"
5897,_SCEVINUS._,"Because he saith they burned the city,—and he"

5903,_SCEVINUS._,And so it was.—
5904,_SCEVINUS._,

5906,_SCEVINUS._,"(_To Piso_) The company, my lord, was gathered here"
5907,_SCEVINUS._,By Fænius Rufus: he and other two
5908,_SCEVINUS._,"Have disappointed me ... My lord, I see"
5909,_SCEVINUS._,My house was chosen for security.
5910,_SCEVINUS._,I’ll take it as a compliment: you are welcome
5911,_SCEVINUS._,To all but my attention. Ha! I think
5912,_SCEVINUS._,"Here be the others.—(_Letting in Rufus, Lateranus and"
5913,_SCEVINUS._,"Flavus._) Welcome, my lords!"
5914,_SCEVINUS._,
5915,_SCEVINUS._,"_Ruf._ I fear we are late, Petronius."
5916,_SCEVINUS._,
5917,_SCEVINUS._,_Pet._                          Make excuse
5918,_SCEVINUS._,To my most honoured guest.                     (_They bow to Piso._)
5919,_SCEVINUS._,
5920,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._                 Ye are come in time
5921,_SCEVINUS._,To share the best of wine.
5922,_SCEVINUS._,
5923,_SCEVINUS._,_Pet._                 Pray serve yourselves:
5924,_SCEVINUS._,I go to close the door ’gainst listeners.
5925,_SCEVINUS._,
5926,_SCEVINUS._,_Ruf._ (_to Luc._). Ye have broached the business?
5927,_SCEVINUS._,
5928,_SCEVINUS._,_Luc._ (_to Ruf._).                                Yes. (_Motioning._)
5929,_SCEVINUS._,
5930,_SCEVINUS._,"_Ruf._                                            Nay, I’ll sit here,"
5931,_SCEVINUS._,And fill my cup.      (_Sitting._)
5932,_SCEVINUS._,
5933,_SCEVINUS._,"_Pis._     And you too, sirs, be seated."
5934,_SCEVINUS._,
5935,_SCEVINUS._,_Ruf._ (_pouring_). I saw a sight as I came here: the mob
5936,_SCEVINUS._,Dragging some wretched Christian to be burned.
5937,_SCEVINUS._,"And all the while his sister ran beside,                        1301"
5938,_SCEVINUS._,With her vain anguish heightening their fury:
5939,_SCEVINUS._,"And he! ... believe me, I never saw a man"
5940,_SCEVINUS._,In all my life look better pleased.—I quaff
5941,_SCEVINUS._,To Piso.
5942,_SCEVINUS._,
5943,_SCEVINUS._,_All_ (_toasting_). Piso! Piso!
5944,_SCEVINUS._,
5945,_SCEVINUS._,_Ruf._                    And what saith
5946,_SCEVINUS._,Calpurnius Piso?
5947,_SCEVINUS._,
5948,_SCEVINUS._,"_Pis_.           How, general?"
5949,_SCEVINUS._,
5950,_SCEVINUS._,_Ruf._                   You consent?
5951,_SCEVINUS._,
5952,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._ Consent to what?
5953,_SCEVINUS._,
5954,_SCEVINUS._,"_Luc._            Speak, Rufus."
5955,_SCEVINUS._,
5956,_SCEVINUS._,_Lat._                          Let the general
5957,_SCEVINUS._,Make our proposals to his lordship.
5958,_SCEVINUS._,
5959,_SCEVINUS._,"_All._                        Hear, hear! (_Petronius returns._)"
5960,_SCEVINUS._,
5961,_SCEVINUS._,"_Ruf._ My lords and gentlemen, since I am chosen"
5962,_SCEVINUS._,"To expound the common thought.... It sprang at first,"
5963,_SCEVINUS._,"I think, of the earthquake: seeing Cæsar’s life"
5964,_SCEVINUS._,"So near extinguished, as it was, at Naples,"
5965,_SCEVINUS._,It came into our minds that no provision
5966,_SCEVINUS._,"Was made for the succession; which neglect,"
5967,_SCEVINUS._,"In case of accident, might cause disturbance,                   1315"
5968,_SCEVINUS._,And saddle us with an upstart. We agreed
5969,_SCEVINUS._,"To choose our Cæsar; but, to shield ourselves,"
5970,_SCEVINUS._,Would sound him privately.
5971,_SCEVINUS._,
5972,_SCEVINUS._,"_Pis._               My noble friends,"
5973,_SCEVINUS._,Ye are justified by circumstance: I share
5974,_SCEVINUS._,"Your fears, and was acquainted with your purpose."
5975,_SCEVINUS._,"But, ere I stand committed to your party,"
5976,_SCEVINUS._,What are their names? Have you them writ?
5977,_SCEVINUS._,
5978,_SCEVINUS._,"_Luc._                              No, no."
5979,_SCEVINUS._,We write no names.
5980,_SCEVINUS._,
5981,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._       Who be they?
5982,_SCEVINUS._,
5983,_SCEVINUS._,_Ruf._                    You see us here.
5984,_SCEVINUS._,"There are besides, my tribunes Statius Proximus"
5985,_SCEVINUS._,And Granius Silvanus: my centurions
5986,_SCEVINUS._,"Scaurus and Paullus. There’s Sulpitius Asper,"
5987,_SCEVINUS._,"And Julius Tugerinus, Martius Festus,"
5988,_SCEVINUS._,"Proculus, a whole list,—Munatius Gratus,"
5989,_SCEVINUS._,Vulcatius Avaricus....
5990,_SCEVINUS._,
5991,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._           And the consul
5992,_SCEVINUS._,Vestinus?
5993,_SCEVINUS._,
5994,_SCEVINUS._,_Ruf._    Nay.
5995,_SCEVINUS._,
5996,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._   Thrasea and Priscus?
5997,_SCEVINUS._,
5998,_SCEVINUS._,_Ruf._                        No.                               1330
5999,_SCEVINUS._,
6000,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._ We lack the senatorials then:  perhaps
6001,_SCEVINUS._,Seneca is with us?
6002,_SCEVINUS._,
6003,_SCEVINUS._,"_Ruf._       Nay, nor he, my lord."
6004,_SCEVINUS._,
6005,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._ You mentioned Proculus: doth Proculus
6006,_SCEVINUS._,Bring all the navy?
6007,_SCEVINUS._,
6008,_SCEVINUS._,"_Ruf._        Nay, our Proculus"
6009,_SCEVINUS._,Is not Volusius.
6010,_SCEVINUS._,
6011,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._     Nor the navy either!
6012,_SCEVINUS._,
6013,_SCEVINUS._,"_Se^{o.}_ I know the Admiral, my lord: let me"
6014,_SCEVINUS._,"Sound him, if he hangs back."
6015,_SCEVINUS._,
6016,_SCEVINUS._,_Fla._                 No hangers-back.
6017,_SCEVINUS._,
6018,_SCEVINUS._,"_Ruf._ Your name, my lord, when we may mention it,"
6019,_SCEVINUS._,Is all-sufficient.
6020,_SCEVINUS._,
6021,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._       I give not my name
6022,_SCEVINUS._,Till Nero is dead.
6023,_SCEVINUS._,
6024,_SCEVINUS._,_Fla._       That will be soon.
6025,_SCEVINUS._,
6026,_SCEVINUS._,_Sce._                          Three days.
6027,_SCEVINUS._,
6028,_SCEVINUS._,_Pis._ Indeed! how know you?
6029,_SCEVINUS._,
6030,_SCEVINUS._,_Sce._                 Here I show you a sword
6031,_SCEVINUS._,I have whetted for the deed.
6032,_SCEVINUS._,
6033,_SCEVINUS._,"_Fla._                 Eh, sir! and who"
6034,_SCEVINUS._,Named thee?
6035,_SCEVINUS._,
6036,_SCEVINUS._,_Sce._      Myself to Capitolian Jove
6037,_SCEVINUS._,Offered myself and weapon.
6038,_SCEVINUS._,
6039,_SCEVINUS._,"_Fla._               And what, I pray,"
6040,_SCEVINUS._,Said Jupiter?
6041,_SCEVINUS._,
6042,_SCEVINUS._,"_Pet._        Peace, peace! Here in my house"
6043,_SCEVINUS._,Let me be chairman.——
6044,_SCEVINUS._,I’ll ask Scevinus first to state his plan.
6045,_SCEVINUS._,
6046,_SCEVINUS._,"_Fla._ Yes, state it, sir."
6047,_SCEVINUS._,
6048,_SCEVINUS._,"_Sce._               I would set fire to his house,"
6049,_SCEVINUS._,And stab him as he hurried to and fro.
6050,_SCEVINUS._,
6051,_SCEVINUS._,_Pet._ Enough of fire. The palace is already
6052,_SCEVINUS._,"Half-burned, and what remains of it is prospectively"
6053,_SCEVINUS._,"Lord Piso’s.—Subrius Flavus, what’s your scheme?"
6054,_SCEVINUS._,
6055,_SCEVINUS._,"_Fla._ I’d kill him when he is singing on the stage,"
6056,_SCEVINUS._,"In face of all the people, a sacrifice"
6057,_SCEVINUS._,To his Greek Apollo.
6058,_SCEVINUS._,
6059,_SCEVINUS._,"_Pet._         Not ill thought of, sir;"
6060,_SCEVINUS._,"But who’s to do it?—Well, Senecio?"
6061,_SCEVINUS._,
6062,_SCEVINUS._,_Se^{o.}_ Why fix the time or place? Let all here swear
6063,_SCEVINUS._,That the first one of us who can approach him
6064,_SCEVINUS._,Shall stab him to the heart.
6065,_SCEVINUS._,
6066,_SCEVINUS._,"_Ruf._                 Yes, and be killed for it."
6067,_SCEVINUS._,’Tis rare that Cæsar goes unguarded now.                        1360
6068,_SCEVINUS._,
6069,_SCEVINUS._,"_Luc._ You bid us sacrifice our lives, but I"
6070,_SCEVINUS._,"Would gaze, like Cassius, on my glorious deed."
6071,_SCEVINUS._,
6072,_SCEVINUS._,"_Pet._ Then, Lucan, have you a plan?"
6073,_SCEVINUS._,
6074,_SCEVINUS._,_Luc._                         I should propose
6075,_SCEVINUS._,To leave the deed to Rufus: he commands
6076,_SCEVINUS._,The needful force.
6077,_SCEVINUS._,
6078,_SCEVINUS._,"_Pet._       Well, Rufus?"
6079,_SCEVINUS._,
6080,_SCEVINUS._,"_Ruf._                    ’Tis not easy,"
6081,_SCEVINUS._,"As Lucan thinks: and if he escape our swords,"
6082,_SCEVINUS._,’Tis death to us all. There is but one way free
6083,_SCEVINUS._,Of personal risk.—If my lord would invite him
6084,_SCEVINUS._,"To an entertainment at his house at Naples,"
6085,_SCEVINUS._,We might be sure of him.
6086,_SCEVINUS._,

6128,_SCEVINUS._,"How her solemnity doth deepen thought,"
6129,_SCEVINUS._,And bring again the lost hellenic Muse

6135,_SCEVINUS._,"Fall to forgetfulness, while bustling day"

6137,_SCEVINUS._,"Your riot and din, the plots and crimes of Rome,—"
6138,_SCEVINUS._,"Than doth a diver in Arabian seas,"
6139,_SCEVINUS._,Plunging for pearls beneath the lonely blue:

6262,LUCAN.,_Luc._       Ha! a passport: from whose hand?
6263,LUCAN.,
6264,LUCAN.,_Ep._ A courtier gave it to me in lieu of money.

6273,LUCAN.,
6274,LUCAN.,"_Ep._ Sir, I was told this book, if given to Nero,"
6275,LUCAN.,Would be thy death. ’Tis writ by thee?                          1475

6283,LUCAN.,"Who art thou, pale and breathless as the grave,"
6284,LUCAN.,That comest thus?
6285,LUCAN.,
6286,LUCAN.,_Ep._       My name is Epicharis.
6287,LUCAN.,"Three days ago, sir, when this book was given me,"
6288,LUCAN.,"I thought to bring it back to thee, from whom"
6289,LUCAN.,"No doubt ’twas stolen, and win gold for my silence."
6290,LUCAN.,To-day I ask not money; but much more
6291,LUCAN.,"I’ll ask, if by this chance I have found in Rome"
6292,LUCAN.,The man to avenge me.
6293,LUCAN.,
6294,LUCAN.,_Luc._          Avenge thee? What is thy wrong?
6295,LUCAN.,Tremble not so.
6296,LUCAN.,
6297,LUCAN.,_Ep._     Wilt thou? Art thou the man?
6298,LUCAN.,Dost thou hate Nero?
6299,LUCAN.,
6300,LUCAN.,"_Luc._         Pray, lady, be still."
6301,LUCAN.,

6304,LUCAN.,"_Luc._                   If thou art wronged by Nero,"
6305,LUCAN.,"Lady, I can and will help thee."
6306,LUCAN.,
6307,LUCAN.,_Ep._                     And thou
6308,LUCAN.,Thyself too art in danger.
6309,LUCAN.,
6310,LUCAN.,_Luc._               In greater danger
6311,LUCAN.,Than thou surmisest.
6312,LUCAN.,
6313,LUCAN.,"_Ep._          If all wait their turn,"
6314,LUCAN.,Who shall be left to avenge?
6315,LUCAN.,
6316,LUCAN.,_Luc._                 I do not wait.
6317,LUCAN.,"Let me beseech thee, lady, master this passion,"
6318,LUCAN.,And tell thy grief.
6319,LUCAN.,
6320,LUCAN.,"_Ep._         My grief? nay, that’s past telling:"
6321,LUCAN.,"There are no words for that. Yet fear not, sir;"
6322,LUCAN.,I can be quiet while I tell my story.
6323,LUCAN.,
6324,LUCAN.,"_Luc._ Be comforted to know thou tellest to one,"
6325,LUCAN.,"Thy sworn ally, before thou sayst a word."
6326,LUCAN.,To his strong mortal anger add thy cause.
6327,LUCAN.,
6328,LUCAN.,"_Ep._ I shall, sir; I can. All womanly soft feeling"
6329,LUCAN.,I have driven for ever from me; and I have sworn
6330,LUCAN.,"A pact with tears, that I will shed not one                     1502"
6331,LUCAN.,Till I be avenged.
6332,LUCAN.,
6333,LUCAN.,_Luc._       Trust me; and tell thy wrong.
6334,LUCAN.,
6335,LUCAN.,"_Ep._ I live at Naples, sir; my mother keeps"
6336,LUCAN.,The tavern where the sailors most resort.
6337,LUCAN.,"My father died five years ago, and then"
6338,LUCAN.,"It happened that my brother, my only brother,—"
6339,LUCAN.,Whose generous nature blamed the life of gain
6340,LUCAN.,"That there we led,—left us, and was ere-long"
6341,LUCAN.,Inveigled by the Christian sect. It happened
6342,LUCAN.,"He met their leader Paulus,—whom ’twas said"
6343,LUCAN.,"Burrus protected,—for he came by Naples,"
6344,LUCAN.,"And there my brother heard him, and after had"
6345,LUCAN.,"Strange visions, and believed the end of the world"
6346,LUCAN.,"Was near, and Christ would come to reign in Rome,"
6347,LUCAN.,"And other doctrines taught by Paul; and lately,"
6348,LUCAN.,"Three days ago, he saw Paul in a dream,"
6349,LUCAN.,"Who beckoned him to Rome. Hither he came,"
6350,LUCAN.,"And I soon after him, being full of fear,"
6351,LUCAN.,"Knowing the ill-odour of his sect, and him"
6352,LUCAN.,Inclined to boast it; and so I came. The Christians
6353,LUCAN.,"Were seized last night, and my poor brother, sir,"
6354,LUCAN.,"Though unknown, unsuspected and unchallenged,"
6355,LUCAN.,Gave himself up. Now all is over.
6356,LUCAN.,
6357,LUCAN.,_Luc._                      Thou meanest....
6358,LUCAN.,
6359,LUCAN.,"_Ep._ I could not stay him. I saw him taken. One Thrasea,       1525"
6360,LUCAN.,"A senator, whose voice seemed powerful with them,"
6361,LUCAN.,Joined his commands with my poor prayers in vain:
6362,LUCAN.,’Twas Nero’s order.
6363,LUCAN.,
6364,LUCAN.,_Luc._        Was he burned?
6365,LUCAN.,
6366,LUCAN.,"_Ep._                        Ye gods,"
6367,LUCAN.,"If there be any gods; if there be Christ,"
6368,LUCAN.,"Or Zeus, or Jove, or who you will, look down,"
6369,LUCAN.,Avenge!
6370,LUCAN.,
6371,LUCAN.,_Luc._  Thou shalt be avenged.
6372,LUCAN.,
6373,LUCAN.,"_Ep._                    I know not, sir,"
6374,LUCAN.,"Where I have been, nor how my brother suffered:"
6375,LUCAN.,"He had no fear; he welcomed death: and yet,—"
6376,LUCAN.,"Ah! what I saw! were it assured a dream,"
6377,LUCAN.,I would not live after that dream; the memory
6378,LUCAN.,"Would make a horror of joy. I pray to die,"
6379,LUCAN.,Die and forget; but first live and avenge him:
6380,LUCAN.,I will do that: help me or show me how.
6381,LUCAN.,
6382,LUCAN.,"_Luc._ Can thy just hate teach thy tongue silence, lady?"
6383,LUCAN.,
6384,LUCAN.,"_Ep._ Fear not my tongue: fear nothing: were I not brave,"
6385,LUCAN.,Should I be alive? should I be here?
6386,LUCAN.,
6387,LUCAN.,"_Luc._                         My secret,"
6388,LUCAN.,"That I shall tell thee, is my life. I am one"
6389,LUCAN.,Of a conspiracy to rid the world
6390,LUCAN.,Of this black monster.
6391,LUCAN.,
6392,LUCAN.,_Ep._            Thou art? thou art? Thou tellst me
6393,LUCAN.,"That I may join? Alas, that I am a woman."
6394,LUCAN.,
6395,LUCAN.,_Luc._ Prove now thy mastery of thyself by reasoning
6396,LUCAN.,In sober terms.
6397,LUCAN.,
6398,LUCAN.,_Ep._     I can.
6399,LUCAN.,
6400,LUCAN.,_Luc._ (_showing the book_). Who gave thee this?
6401,LUCAN.,
6402,LUCAN.,_Ep._ Senecio.
6403,LUCAN.,
6404,LUCAN.,_Luc._   Ha! Senecio! can it be....
6405,LUCAN.,
6406,LUCAN.,"_Ep._ Thou mayst not think it, sir, seeing me to-day:"
6407,LUCAN.,But yesterday thou wouldst have well believed
6408,LUCAN.,I might have lovers.
6409,LUCAN.,
6410,LUCAN.,"_Luc._         ... At Naples, at this tavern,"

6414,LUCAN.,
6415,LUCAN.,_Luc._           How doth he stand towards Cæsar?
6416,LUCAN.,
6417,LUCAN.,_Ep._ He hates him.
6418,LUCAN.,
6419,LUCAN.,"_Luc._        Yes, but would he join our party?"
6420,LUCAN.,We have no means to sound him: this Senecio
6421,LUCAN.,Has taken it on himself. I did not trust him;
6422,LUCAN.,Now I suspect him.
6423,LUCAN.,
6424,LUCAN.,_Ep._        You would win the navy?
6425,LUCAN.,
6426,LUCAN.,_Luc._ ’Tis that.
6427,LUCAN.,
6428,LUCAN.,_Ep._       I could approach him.
6429,LUCAN.,
6430,LUCAN.,_Luc._                            I think thou mayst.
6431,LUCAN.,Bide with me here to-day; for ere we talk
6432,LUCAN.,Thou must have food & sleep. I shall speak with thee
6433,LUCAN.,More confidently then: thou art now o’erstrained.
6434,LUCAN.,
6435,LUCAN.,_Ep._ I shall not sleep.

6465,_MARINERS._,_Gri._ Weather permitting.
6466,_MARINERS._,
6467,_MARINERS._,"_1st M._ No: no weather permitting. If it had been weather permitting,"
6468,_MARINERS._,would they have put out in the teeth of a sou’-wester? that’s what I
6469,_MARINERS._,look at.
6470,_MARINERS._,
6471,_MARINERS._,_2nd M._ No sailor would have done it; least of all Regulus.
6472,_MARINERS._,
6473,_MARINERS._,_Gri._ Then ’twas Cæsar’s fault not to have said weather permitting.
6474,_MARINERS._,
6475,_MARINERS._,_3rd M._ Eight firstrates: the pick of the fleet.
6476,_MARINERS._,
6477,_MARINERS._,"_1st M._ Nay, seven, mate. The Ulysses is put in for repairs."

6483,_SENECIO._,"_1st M._ Why, where have you been, sir? Half the fleet’s ashore off"
6484,_SENECIO._,Misenum.
6485,_SENECIO._,
6486,_SENECIO._,_Se^{o.}_ Wrecked?
6487,_SENECIO._,
6488,_SENECIO._,"_Gri._ Ay, that they be."

6490,_SENECIO._,_Enter Epicharis._

6493,_EPICHARIS._,
6494,_EPICHARIS._,"Is it true, Gripus? Is the squadron lost?"
6495,_EPICHARIS._,
6496,_EPICHARIS._,_Gri._ True enough.
6497,_EPICHARIS._,
6498,_EPICHARIS._,_Ep._ Was the Admiral with them?
6499,_EPICHARIS._,
6500,_EPICHARIS._,"_1st M._ Regulus: ’twas Regulus at Formiæ, lady."
6501,_EPICHARIS._,
6502,_EPICHARIS._,_Ep._ Not Proculus?
6503,_EPICHARIS._,
6504,_EPICHARIS._,"_1st M._ Nay, he’s with his ships in the bay."
6505,_EPICHARIS._,
6506,_EPICHARIS._,_Ep._ And the crews?
6507,_EPICHARIS._,
6508,_EPICHARIS._,"_2nd M._ Ther’ll not be many stand up, when they come ashore."
6509,_EPICHARIS._,
6510,_EPICHARIS._,_Ep._ Poor fellows! And whose fault was this?
6511,_EPICHARIS._,
6512,_EPICHARIS._,"_Gri._ Cæsar’s, I say, lady: and none else."
6513,_EPICHARIS._,
6514,_EPICHARIS._,"_Se^{o.}_ Epicharis, see, I am returned. 1600"
6515,_EPICHARIS._,
6516,_EPICHARIS._,"_Ep._ Well, I see you, sir. Have you been to Rome and back so soon?"
6517,_EPICHARIS._,
6518,_EPICHARIS._,"_Se^{o.}_ Yes, my house is pulled down. But I saw the Christians burned."
6519,_EPICHARIS._,
6520,_EPICHARIS._,"_Ep._ Hark, sir; I have news for you. (_Takes him aside and speaks with"
6521,_EPICHARIS._,him._)

6523,_EPICHARIS._,_Enter Proculus._
6524,_EPICHARIS._,
6525,_PROCULUS._,_PROCULUS._
6526,_PROCULUS._,
6527,_PROCULUS._,"What! a dozen of you fellows here! Up with you! be sharp, and off to"
6528,_PROCULUS._,the point. See if you can’t be of some use. You may save a life or two
6529,_PROCULUS._,yet.
6530,_PROCULUS._,
6531,_PROCULUS._,"_Mar._ We have no orders, my lord."
6532,_PROCULUS._,
6533,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ Where do you expect to find your orders? Go and help your mates.
6534,_PROCULUS._,You may get into a scrape yourselves some day.
6535,_PROCULUS._,
6536,_PROCULUS._,"_Mar._ Very willing, my lord; so we be sent. (_All drain their cups"
6537,_PROCULUS._,standing._)
6538,_PROCULUS._,
6539,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Come, leave your possets."
6540,_PROCULUS._,
6541,_PROCULUS._,"_Mar._ Ay, ay, my lord.                              [_Exeunt Mariners._"
6542,_PROCULUS._,
6543,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Epicharis, wine!"
6544,_PROCULUS._,
6545,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._ Gauran, my lord?"
6546,_PROCULUS._,
6547,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Yes.—And you, sir, I think are the gentleman that begged to go"
6548,_PROCULUS._,aboard the fleet to get clear of the earthquake. What did I tell you?
6549,_PROCULUS._,
6550,_PROCULUS._,"_Se^{o.}_ You did not tell me, my lord, that Cæsar ordered you to be"
6551,_PROCULUS._,shipwrecked. (_Epicharis serves Pro. with wine._)
6552,_PROCULUS._,
6553,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Well, ’twas his doing: I’ll bear no blame of it. Three days ago"
6554,_PROCULUS._,it was Cæsar’s intention to go to Greece; we must therefore be ready
6555,_PROCULUS._,to meet him at Brundisium. Never had more stringent orders. Now he has
6556,_PROCULUS._,"forgot all about it, and gone to Rome: and I have lost a third of the"
6557,_PROCULUS._,fleet for nothing. May all the gods....
6558,_PROCULUS._,
6559,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ The fire took him to Rome.
6560,_PROCULUS._,
6561,_PROCULUS._,"_Se^{o.}_ The Romans, my lord, can never spare him long: their bread"
6562,_PROCULUS._,depends on him.
6563,_PROCULUS._,
6564,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ Can’t that old shrimper Tigellinus feed ’em on sprats?
6565,_PROCULUS._,
6566,_PROCULUS._,"_Se^{o.}_ Hi, hi!"
6567,_PROCULUS._,
6568,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Well, sir!"
6569,_PROCULUS._,
6570,_PROCULUS._,_Se^{o.}_ I shan’t tell.
6571,_PROCULUS._,
6572,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._ The wine will soothe you, my lord. (_Refilling his cup, she signs"
6573,_PROCULUS._,"to Senecio, who goes out._)"
6574,_PROCULUS._,
6575,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Thank you, lass."
6576,_PROCULUS._,
6577,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ Did Cæsar give the order himself?
6578,_PROCULUS._,
6579,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Don’t talk to me. Ha, that fellow’s gone, is he? He is not one"
6580,_PROCULUS._,to blab?
6581,_PROCULUS._,
6582,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._ How should I know, my lord?"
6583,_PROCULUS._,
6584,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ What’s his name?
6585,_PROCULUS._,
6586,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ Senecio.
6587,_PROCULUS._,
6588,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Senecio, yes, of course: one of Nero’s intimates: and I called"
6589,_PROCULUS._,Tigellinus an old shrimper: ’twould cost me my life if he heard it.
6590,_PROCULUS._,
6591,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ No man is safe. 1650
6592,_PROCULUS._,
6593,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Nor woman either, Epicharis: guard your tongue."
6594,_PROCULUS._,
6595,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._ I am a Greek, my lord."
6596,_PROCULUS._,
6597,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ What’s that to serve thee?
6598,_PROCULUS._,
6599,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._                       Nothing truly; and yet
6600,_PROCULUS._,I have no share in Rome’s reproach; I laugh
6601,_PROCULUS._,Rather to see my country’s conquerors
6602,_PROCULUS._,Themselves enslaved. I have no pride in Cæsar:
6603,_PROCULUS._,"Let him be a madman, one day burn his city,"
6604,_PROCULUS._,"The next day wreck his fleet,—poison his brother,—"
6605,_PROCULUS._,"Murder his mother,—behead his wife,—I care not."
6606,_PROCULUS._,"Let all his courtiers be curs, and he"
6607,_PROCULUS._,Sing in the theatre.... In Greece a tyrant
6608,_PROCULUS._,"Had little heart for singing; nay, at night"
6609,_PROCULUS._,"He slept not, thinking what undaunted spirits"
6610,_PROCULUS._,Were lying wide-awake for torturing shame
6611,_PROCULUS._,Till they could kill him.
6612,_PROCULUS._,
6613,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._              By Jove, thou hast a tongue!"
6614,_PROCULUS._,
6615,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ And they that like it not may cut it out.
6616,_PROCULUS._,
6617,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Drink with me, lass (_offers his cup_)."
6618,_PROCULUS._,
6619,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._                I would I were a Roman
6620,_PROCULUS._,But for one day.
6621,_PROCULUS._,
6622,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._     I love thee for thy spirit.
6623,_PROCULUS._,
6624,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ Thou lov’st to hear the words thou dar’st not say.
6625,_PROCULUS._,
6626,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._ Well, give me more."
6627,_PROCULUS._,
6628,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._                Greek as I am, my lord,"
6629,_PROCULUS._,"And woman, were I now as near to Cæsar"
6630,_PROCULUS._,"As I am to you, I’d stab him to the heart."
6631,_PROCULUS._,
6632,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ I would not stay thee.
6633,_PROCULUS._,
6634,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._                   But thou wouldst not do it.
6635,_PROCULUS._,
6636,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ Bah! thou’rt a Greek to brag what thou wouldst do:       1675
6637,_PROCULUS._,"I am a Roman, and would do the thing"
6638,_PROCULUS._,Before I spake it.
6639,_PROCULUS._,
6640,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._        Yet mightst never do it.
6641,_PROCULUS._,
6642,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ Thou know’st me not.
6643,_PROCULUS._,
6644,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._                 Then none knows thee, my lord."
6645,_PROCULUS._,"Were there a plot among the brave in Rome,"
6646,_PROCULUS._,"Which they should fear to break to thee, and say"
6647,_PROCULUS._,"We know him not, we cannot risk to sound him,"
6648,_PROCULUS._,"A woman might; then should they send a woman,"
6649,_PROCULUS._,"Some woman that thou lov’st, to learn thy mind,"
6650,_PROCULUS._,What wouldst thou say?
6651,_PROCULUS._,
6652,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._           Then were it time to speak.
6653,_PROCULUS._,
6654,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ The brave in Rome have plotted: I am the woman—
6655,_PROCULUS._,Their messenger.
6656,_PROCULUS._,
6657,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._     What! a conspiracy?
6658,_PROCULUS._,’Gainst Cæsar’s life?
6659,_PROCULUS._,
6660,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._           They bid thee bring the navy.
6661,_PROCULUS._,
6662,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ Art thou in earnest?
6663,_PROCULUS._,
6664,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._                 I am a Greek, my lord;"
6665,_PROCULUS._,And risk my life for Roman liberty.
6666,_PROCULUS._,
6667,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ What are their names?
6668,_PROCULUS._,
6669,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._                  The best in Rome.
6670,_PROCULUS._,
6671,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._                                   Who are they?
6672,_PROCULUS._,
6673,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ In time I’ll tell their names.
6674,_PROCULUS._,
6675,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._                         And what the plot?
6676,_PROCULUS._,
6677,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ In three days Cæsar will be slain: ’tis asked
6678,_PROCULUS._,"Of thee that thou wilt bring thy ships to Ostia,"
6679,_PROCULUS._,And seize the granaries till Rome is ours.
6680,_PROCULUS._,
6681,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ What are their names?
6682,_PROCULUS._,
6683,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._                  With fair security
6684,_PROCULUS._,I will tell all.
6685,_PROCULUS._,
6686,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._     And what security
6687,_PROCULUS._,For me?
6688,_PROCULUS._,
6689,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._   Enough, my lord, even in this risk"
6690,_PROCULUS._,To well content thee.
6691,_PROCULUS._,
6692,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._          Tell me the chief names.
6693,_PROCULUS._,
6694,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ When I have won thee.
6695,_PROCULUS._,
6696,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._                Thou hast won me: tell.
6697,_PROCULUS._,
6698,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ In good time all.
6699,_PROCULUS._,
6700,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._            What would they have me do?
6701,_PROCULUS._,
6702,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ First bring the officers whose names are here (_Giving a paper_)
6703,_PROCULUS._,To meet me here to-night. Then I shall see
6704,_PROCULUS._,Who is to trust.
6705,_PROCULUS._,
6706,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._ (_reading the paper_). Give me the names of those
6707,_PROCULUS._,Who sent thee.
6708,_PROCULUS._,
6709,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._    In good time.
6710,_PROCULUS._,
6711,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._                 I would not harm thee.
6712,_PROCULUS._,
6713,_PROCULUS._,_Ep._ Thou canst not.
6714,_PROCULUS._,
6715,_PROCULUS._,"_Pro._          See, Epicharis, I’ll help thee"
6716,_PROCULUS._,"Out of this mischief. Give me up the names,"
6717,_PROCULUS._,And thou shalt be informer.
6718,_PROCULUS._,
6719,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._                 Ah, Proculus,"
6720,_PROCULUS._,Play not that part; thou that so oft in secret
6721,_PROCULUS._,Hast cursed the tyrant to me; now play not
6722,_PROCULUS._,"That part; it cannot serve thee: be true, Proculus,"
6723,_PROCULUS._,"To the nobleness within thee, that hast not only"
6724,_PROCULUS._,"A heart sufficient, but in face and figure"
6725,_PROCULUS._,Lookest the hero: thou that mightest stand
6726,_PROCULUS._,"For a statue of Brutus, and outdo the man"
6727,_PROCULUS._,As nature made him: Be thou from this day
6728,_PROCULUS._,"Named with the noblest; Proculus the brave,"
6729,_PROCULUS._,"Who turned the tide ’gainst Nero, and delivered"
6730,_PROCULUS._,Romans from shame and slavery;—or wilt thou
6731,_PROCULUS._,"Be Proculus the futile; Proculus,"
6732,_PROCULUS._,Who aided first infamous Anicetus
6733,_PROCULUS._,"To murder Agrippina, and then perceiving"
6734,_PROCULUS._,"Remorseful Cæsar cast out his gross tool,"
6735,_PROCULUS._,"Sought to win favour of the parricide,—"
6736,_PROCULUS._,"And vainly tried to stay the avenger’s hands,—"
6737,_PROCULUS._,"And sold a trustful woman whom he had loved,                    1725"
6738,_PROCULUS._,On the eve of liberty?
6739,_PROCULUS._,
6740,_PROCULUS._,_Pro._           That day’s not come.
6741,_PROCULUS._,"Look to thyself, and I will win thy safety."
6742,_PROCULUS._,To-night thou wilt set forth with me to Rome:
6743,_PROCULUS._,In two days I shall bring thee before Cæsar.
6744,_PROCULUS._,"Then, if thou tell these names, thou wilt go free,"
6745,_PROCULUS._,And mayst be rich. Thou canst not ’scape: be ready
6746,_PROCULUS._,In one hour hence.                                          [_Exit._
6747,_PROCULUS._,
6748,_PROCULUS._,"_Ep._        Ah, wretched Roman slave,"
6749,_PROCULUS._,Thy paltry spirit hath baulked me: go thy way;
6750,_PROCULUS._,"Thou knowest nought: thou’rt in my power; thou too,"
6751,_PROCULUS._,"If I could turn aside, shouldst bleed for Clitus:"
6752,_PROCULUS._,"He hated thee, condemned thee, and thou deservest."
6753,_PROCULUS._,But what care I for thee? what is’t to me
6754,_PROCULUS._,That Piso be set up on Nero’s throne?
6755,_PROCULUS._,"Only make void that throne, only tear out"
6756,_PROCULUS._,"That monster from the world. As for thee, Proculus,"
6757,_PROCULUS._,I know thee and can outwit thee: I have my tale

6847,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._                     Yes, space:"
6848,_POPPÆA._,Grandeur in space: we cannot emulate
6849,_POPPÆA._,Starry distinctions and ethereal peace;
6850,_POPPÆA._,Mortal conditions hamper us ... yet I’ll teach                  1775
6851,_POPPÆA._,The world what may be done; and my new Rome
6852,_POPPÆA._,"Shall stand for a type: the streets all laid out broad,"
6853,_POPPÆA._,Straight and intelligible; and all the houses
6854,_POPPÆA._,Of fireproof stone from Alba and Gabii.
6855,_POPPÆA._,In four years ’twill be finished.
6856,_POPPÆA._,
6857,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._                      Four whole years
6858,_POPPÆA._,Of rubbish-heaps and hammering?
6859,_POPPÆA._,
6860,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._                    Come see
6861,_POPPÆA._,The plans in the library.
6862,_POPPÆA._,
6863,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._              Would you believe
6864,_POPPÆA._,The plans of architects can cheer a woman?
6865,_POPPÆA._,
6866,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ If thou wert happy thou wouldst love to see
6867,_POPPÆA._,"All that I do, and for my sake admire."
6868,_POPPÆA._,"I wish that thou wert happier. Think, Poppæa,"
6869,_POPPÆA._,"What cause thou hast, being for thy peerless beauty"
6870,_POPPÆA._,Chosen the world’s Augusta. I could wish
6871,_POPPÆA._,Thou didst smile oftener.
6872,_POPPÆA._,
6873,_POPPÆA._,"_Pop._              Well, consider, love,"
6874,_POPPÆA._,I have cause for care.
6875,_POPPÆA._,
6876,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._           I wish that thou couldst sing:
6877,_POPPÆA._,"Music can cheer. Dost thou remember once,"
6878,_POPPÆA._,"When thou wast fearful in a thunderstorm,"
6879,_POPPÆA._,How I diverted thee with sprightly music?
6880,_POPPÆA._,"Then I should love if, when I came to see thee,"
6881,_POPPÆA._,"I heard thy voice afar, and in thy chamber...."

6884,_POPPÆA._,
6885,_POPPÆA._,Who’s there? (_Vatinius gives a note to Nero._)
6886,_POPPÆA._,(_Reads._) ‘Proculus the admiral is come from Naples
6887,_POPPÆA._,With secret tidings; he hath a lady with him!’
6888,_POPPÆA._,"(_To Vat._) Let him in, or his tidings, or his lady,"
6889,_POPPÆA._,Whichever is most secret—or all three.                 [_Exit Vat._
6890,_POPPÆA._,"(_To Poppæa, who is going._) Thou needst not go, love."

6893,_POPPÆA._,
6894,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ Pooh! ’tis some state affair.
6895,_POPPÆA._,
6896,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._                         I hate affairs.              [_Exit._

6900,_POPPÆA._,To rid the world of this and all its plagues!                   1805

6906,_POPPÆA._,"_PROCULUS._ Forgive the intrusion, Cæsar."
6907,_POPPÆA._,
6908,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._                              The lady’s looks
6909,_POPPÆA._,Are ample excuse. You ask leave to be married?
6910,_POPPÆA._,
6911,_POPPÆA._,"_Pro._ Nay, Cæsar; I accuse her."
6912,_POPPÆA._,
6913,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._                     Bravo! divorce?

6922,_POPPÆA._,This is a charge ’gainst me: a foolish charge

6924,_POPPÆA._,"Would make short matter of it, might he enter."

6940,_POPPÆA._,_Pro._                   This lady
6941,_POPPÆA._,Was known to me at Naples.
6942,_POPPÆA._,

6949,_POPPÆA._,You sailors! (_Vat. re-enters with Senecio._)
6950,_POPPÆA._,"(_To Epicharis_) See your witness, lady, is come."
6951,_POPPÆA._,
6952,_POPPÆA._,_Pro._ She took occasion of her intimacy
6953,_POPPÆA._,To draw me into a plot ’gainst Cæsar’s life.
6954,_POPPÆA._,
6955,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ Ha!
6956,_POPPÆA._,
6957,_POPPÆA._,_Pro._ Entrusted by conspirators at Rome
6958,_POPPÆA._,Three days ago to tamper with me.

6962,_POPPÆA._,
6963,_POPPÆA._,_Ep._          Will Cæsar hear the end?
6964,_POPPÆA._,

6967,_POPPÆA._,"_Pro._                                   I know no names,"
6968,_POPPÆA._,Cæsar; she would not tell.
6969,_POPPÆA._,
6970,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._               No names? and whom
6971,_POPPÆA._,Wert thou then to conspire with?
6972,_POPPÆA._,
6973,_POPPÆA._,_Pro._                     She would tell
6974,_POPPÆA._,"Nothing of her confederates, unless"
6975,_POPPÆA._,"I brought together certain officers,"
6976,_POPPÆA._,Whose loyalty I know suspicious.
6977,_POPPÆA._,
6978,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._                     Dost thou? By God,"
6979,_POPPÆA._,I’ll have théir names.
6980,_POPPÆA._,
6981,_POPPÆA._,"_Pro._           I was to sail to Rome,"
6982,_POPPÆA._,And seize the granaries.
6983,_POPPÆA._,
6984,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._             Enough. Now, madam;"
6985,_POPPÆA._,What dost thou answer?
6986,_POPPÆA._,
6987,_POPPÆA._,_Ep._            If Cæsar need an answer
6988,_POPPÆA._,"To a charge so empty, ’tis enough to say"
6989,_POPPÆA._,I have never been in Rome.
6990,_POPPÆA._,
6991,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._               ’Tis not enough.
6992,_POPPÆA._,Didst thou speak to the Admiral in the sense
6993,_POPPÆA._,He avers?
6994,_POPPÆA._,
6995,_POPPÆA._,_Ep._     I humbly crave great Cæsar’s pardon
6996,_POPPÆA._,For jesting with his name.
6997,_POPPÆA._,
6998,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._               Thou didst? and why?
6999,_POPPÆA._,
7000,_POPPÆA._,_Ep._ Here is my witness; Lord Senecio
7001,_POPPÆA._,Will say that my story is true. Holding with him
7002,_POPPÆA._,"Some talk of Proculus, I laid a wager"
7003,_POPPÆA._,That I could make the Admiral believe
7004,_POPPÆA._,"Anything, no matter how ridiculous:"
7005,_POPPÆA._,"And this we hit on. Then straight he comes in,"
7006,_POPPÆA._,"And if I went too far, ’twas in my fear"
7007,_POPPÆA._,To lose my money.
7008,_POPPÆA._,
7009,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._      Is this so, Senecio?"
7010,_POPPÆA._,
7011,_SENECIO._,_SENECIO._
7012,_SENECIO._,
7013,_SENECIO._,"’Twas so, sire; I backed the Admiral, and lost."
7014,_SENECIO._,
7015,_SENECIO._,_Ner._ (_to Proc._). You sailors are so clumsy. You are a fool.
7016,_SENECIO._,
7017,_SENECIO._,_Pro._ Sire! on my life ’twas true. ’Twas not a jest:
7018,_SENECIO._,She would outface me.
7019,_SENECIO._,
7020,_VATINIUS._,_VATINIUS._
7021,_VATINIUS._,
7022,_VATINIUS._,As Octavia did

7025,_VATINIUS._,_Tig._ Hish!
7026,_VATINIUS._,
7027,_VATINIUS._,"_Ner._       First, sir,"
7028,_VATINIUS._,Send me these same suspicious officers.
7029,_VATINIUS._,"Meanwhile for her,—thy rank may win thy tale"
7030,_VATINIUS._,"So much respect,—she goes not free. (_To Tig._) Good master,"
7031,_VATINIUS._,Keep her in custody.
7032,_VATINIUS._,
7033,_VATINIUS._,_Ep._ (_aside to Proculus_). Hear me! I warn thee.
7034,_VATINIUS._,"Join, or be first to die!"
7035,_VATINIUS._,
7036,_VATINIUS._,"_Pro._              Now, Cæsar, again"
7037,_VATINIUS._,She invites me to conspire.
7038,_VATINIUS._,
7039,_VATINIUS._,"_Ner._                Come, man; she mocks thee:"
7040,_VATINIUS._,She hath won the privilege. (_To Tig._) Take her away;
7041,_VATINIUS._,But treat her well. You follow me: I go
7042,_VATINIUS._,To judge the cases argued yesterday.
7043,_VATINIUS._,"No folly, Proculus, like being in earnest,"
7044,_VATINIUS._,When others are all jesting.

7194,_LATERANUS._,_Ruf._ But how to act?
7195,_LATERANUS._,

7199,_LATERANUS._,"I, under the pretence of some request,"
7200,_LATERANUS._,"Will kneel to him, as Cimber knelt to Cæsar;"

7210,_LATERANUS._,"_Ruf._                    Better, Sir,"
7211,_LATERANUS._,Do without him. And I still hold my plan
7212,_LATERANUS._,"The best, that Cæsar should be asked to supper:     1925"
7213,_LATERANUS._,Then nought were risked. Once more I pray Lord Piso
7214,_LATERANUS._,To save unneeded bloodshed.

7216,_LATERANUS._,_Pis._                I could not do it:
7217,_LATERANUS._,"Nor were it wise, in face of the great pity"
7218,_LATERANUS._,Such treachery would stir.
7219,_LATERANUS._,
7220,_LATERANUS._,_Asp._               And the delay:

7222,_LATERANUS._,
7223,_LATERANUS._,_Ruf._       Then Lateranus hath it:
7224,_LATERANUS._,"We adopt his disposition. You, my lord,"
7225,_LATERANUS._,Must be by dawn to-morrow in Ceres’ temple
7226,_LATERANUS._,Clad in imperial purple: I with my guards
7227,_LATERANUS._,Will keep the doors; and when the deed is done
7228,_LATERANUS._,"Will bring you forth, and lead you through the city,"
7229,_LATERANUS._,Proclaiming you with shouts.
7230,_LATERANUS._,
7231,_LATERANUS._,"_Pis._                 Well, let it be so."
7232,_LATERANUS._,I give consent. Let nothing stop you now:
7233,_LATERANUS._,But each man learn his part and act it bravely.
7234,_LATERANUS._,Your lives are forfeit. Secrecy and despatch—
7235,_LATERANUS._,And now depart.
7236,_LATERANUS._,
7237,_LATERANUS._,_Ruf._    Be you in Ceres’ temple.
7238,_LATERANUS._,
7239,_LATERANUS._,_Pis._ I understand. I shall await you there.
7240,_LATERANUS._,"Action, Rufus, is now your only hope;"
7241,_LATERANUS._,Let nothing stop you. Fail me not.
7242,_LATERANUS._,
7243,_LATERANUS._,"_Ruf._                       Nay, trust me."

7443,_QUINTIAN._,And go first to the prison: look thyself
7444,_QUINTIAN._,To the torture of Epicharis: from her
7445,_QUINTIAN._,"Learn all, and bring it to me here. A woman"
7446,_QUINTIAN._,Is delicately nerved: use thy full art
7447,_QUINTIAN._,Most exquisitely.
7448,_QUINTIAN._,
7449,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._      She hath confessed by this:
7450,_QUINTIAN._,I sent at once.

7452,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._    Return then soon.
7453,_QUINTIAN._,
7454,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._                      I shall.                        [_Exit._
7455,_QUINTIAN._,
7456,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._ A plot! and this contemptible Scevinus
7457,_QUINTIAN._,I could almost forgive; that woman never.
7458,_QUINTIAN._,"She fooled me to my face, laughed as she fooled me:"
7459,_QUINTIAN._,A Common woman! Cæsar! me! on the eve
7460,_QUINTIAN._,Of being the ridicule of history:
7461,_QUINTIAN._,"My wisdom a mockery,—my insight,—to the end of time"
7462,_QUINTIAN._,"Schoolboys to laugh at turning of my page,"
7463,_QUINTIAN._,The favourite tale to spice their dreary task.
7464,_QUINTIAN._,"Nero! and I who, when my very mother,"
7465,_QUINTIAN._,"She who upraised me, dared to plot against me,"
7466,_QUINTIAN._,"Scrupled not, I, for my world-reaching schemes"
7467,_QUINTIAN._,"And absolute power, I scrupled not to hide"
7468,_QUINTIAN._,"Sonship in Cæsardom: yes, and for that"
7469,_QUINTIAN._,"Have oped my soul-gates to the powers of hell,"
7470,_QUINTIAN._,"And daily face spectres of horror, ghostly"
7471,_QUINTIAN._,"Environments, the blue upbraiding lips"
7472,_QUINTIAN._,"Of shadowy forms, that kiss in mockery,"
7473,_QUINTIAN._,And poison peace upon the paths of sleep.
7474,_QUINTIAN._,"To have borne in vain the murderer’s scaring plague,"
7475,_QUINTIAN._,"To be by a common woman—killed: I doubt not,"
7476,_QUINTIAN._,"Had but occasion served, she would have done it."
7477,_QUINTIAN._,"Have laughed to do it, laughed on when ’twas done."
7478,_QUINTIAN._,"Ah! by that lately-laughing, cherruping mouth"
7479,_QUINTIAN._,Shall all her damned conspirators be snared:
7480,_QUINTIAN._,"Yes, and a thousand times shall she scream truth,"
7481,_QUINTIAN._,Ere I will hear; a thousand times shriek forth
7482,_QUINTIAN._,"The names of those her shrieks shall shriek to hell,"
7483,_QUINTIAN._,"Ere she go after them. (_Re-enter Tigellinus._) What, Tigellinus!"
7484,_QUINTIAN._,What saith Epicharis?
7485,_QUINTIAN._,
7486,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._          Nothing.
7487,_QUINTIAN._,
7488,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._                   Nothing?
7489,_QUINTIAN._,
7490,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._                            Nothing.
7491,_QUINTIAN._,Cæsar will never get a word from her.
7492,_QUINTIAN._,
7493,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ner._ Thou hast not killed her, fool?"
7494,_QUINTIAN._,
7495,_QUINTIAN._,"_Tig._                           Nay, Cæsar: but no corpse"
7496,_QUINTIAN._,Keeps better silence.
7497,_QUINTIAN._,
7498,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ner._          Where’s thy art, man? Use"
7499,_QUINTIAN._,"Rack, redhot pincers, the slow fire ..."
7500,_QUINTIAN._,
7501,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._ Not all together make her give a sound.
7502,_QUINTIAN._,
7503,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._ Persist.
7504,_QUINTIAN._,
7505,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._    They do; but ’tis beyond our power
7506,_QUINTIAN._,To match the first pangs; and they moved her not.
7507,_QUINTIAN._,I came to say we had forgot Senecio.
7508,_QUINTIAN._,
7509,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._ True: take him.
7510,_QUINTIAN._,
7511,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._           And to torture?
7512,_QUINTIAN._,
7513,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._                           Rack him well.
7514,_QUINTIAN._,But make this woman speak. Use better art.      2080
7515,_QUINTIAN._,
7516,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._ I found the torturers sitting round their task:
7517,_QUINTIAN._,Their zest had cooled. Without a cry or scream
7518,_QUINTIAN._,’Tis a dull sport.
7519,_QUINTIAN._,
7520,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ner._       She is a Christian, then."
7521,_QUINTIAN._,
7522,_QUINTIAN._,"_Tig._ The Christians never plot: I think in that,"
7523,_QUINTIAN._,"Cæsar, you wrong them."
7524,_QUINTIAN._,
7525,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._           I? Thou know’st them little:
7526,_QUINTIAN._,They are the time’s worst plague. I do not care
7527,_QUINTIAN._,If they burned Rome or no: were they all burned
7528,_QUINTIAN._,"’Twould richly compensate the world. Hark, friend!"
7529,_QUINTIAN._,The people might be masters; what they lack
7530,_QUINTIAN._,"This Christ provides. Were I to prophesy,"
7531,_QUINTIAN._,"I’d say that should their cursed doctrines spread,"
7532,_QUINTIAN._,"They would one day drown all, learning and beauty,"
7533,_QUINTIAN._,"Wisdom and rule and art. For that I hate them,"
7534,_QUINTIAN._,And love to destroy them. I AM THEIR ANTI-CHRIST.

7680,_PISO._,_Fla._ Natalis and Scevinus both are taken.
7681,_PISO._,All must be known; and your complicity
7682,_PISO._,The first: meanwhile Rufus is unsuspected;
7683,_PISO._,Cæsar hath summoned him to sit as judge
7684,_PISO._,In trial of the accused this afternoon.
7685,_PISO._,"He has therefore this last hope, but only this,"
7686,_PISO._,That you with all your friends proceed at once

7698,_PISO._,Is not despair. I venture it with gladness.
7699,_PISO._,
7700,_PISO._,_Pis._ So do not I. I am no doubt betrayed
7701,_PISO._,Already and watched.
7702,_PISO._,
7703,_PISO._,_Fla._         Rufus may still be clear:

7705,_PISO._,Remain their last resource.
7706,_PISO._,
7707,_PISO._,"_Pis._                Bid him act quickly,"

7710,_PISO._,"_Fla._     My lord, he looks to you."
7711,_PISO._,Unless you appear we cannot gain the people.
7712,_PISO._,Consider how we have all trusted our lives

7958,_QUINTIAN._,My lord.
7959,_QUINTIAN._,
7960,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._ Dost thou confess?
7961,_QUINTIAN._,
7962,_QUINTIAN._,_Qu._               I give Scevinus
7963,_QUINTIAN._,The lie direct.

7965,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ner._    We found thee in his company,"

7967,_QUINTIAN._,
7968,_QUINTIAN._,"_Qu._             Cæsar, I knew"
7969,_QUINTIAN._,Of nothing ’gainst thy life. ’Tis true that oft
7970,_QUINTIAN._,"I have spoken against Vatinius; were he Cæsar,"
7971,_QUINTIAN._,I should be guilty: but yourself have loved
7972,_QUINTIAN._,"To prick me to it; and so, maybe, my tongue"
7973,_QUINTIAN._,Hath given Scevinus undeserved occasion
7974,_QUINTIAN._,To think me of his party.
7975,_QUINTIAN._,
7976,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ner._              Rufus, judge!"
7977,_QUINTIAN._,
7978,_QUINTIAN._,_Ruf._ I look for evidence.
7979,_QUINTIAN._,
7980,_QUINTIAN._,"_Tig._                Dost thou?—Then, Quintian,"
7981,_QUINTIAN._,To save thy life wilt thou inform?
7982,_QUINTIAN._,
7983,_QUINTIAN._,_Qu._                        I will.
7984,_QUINTIAN._,
7985,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._ Then was not Lucan with you?
7986,_QUINTIAN._,
7987,_QUINTIAN._,_Qu._                         He was.
7988,_QUINTIAN._,
7989,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ner._                                O Quintian,"
7990,_QUINTIAN._,"Quintian! if I forgave thee for thy treason,"
7991,_QUINTIAN._,I could not for thy folly. Arrest him.
7992,_QUINTIAN._,
7993,_QUINTIAN._,_Ruf._                           Arrest Quintian.
7994,_QUINTIAN._,The next?
7995,_QUINTIAN._,
7996,_QUINTIAN._,"_Tig._    Senecio, General, hath confessed."
7997,_QUINTIAN._,His evidence we will take later. Where is
7998,_QUINTIAN._,Lucan?
7999,_QUINTIAN._,
8000,_QUINTIAN._,"_Luc._ I am here, my lord, ready to answer."
8001,_QUINTIAN._,
8002,_QUINTIAN._,_Ruf._ Then let us hear thine answer.
8003,_QUINTIAN._,
8004,_QUINTIAN._,_Luc._                          I deny
8005,_QUINTIAN._,The charge of treason: but so far confess
8006,_QUINTIAN._,"My intimacy with the accused, that oft"
8007,_QUINTIAN._,My zeal for senatorial forms hath led me
8008,_QUINTIAN._,"To listen to them, when the words that passed"
8009,_QUINTIAN._,Might tell against me: and if I was betrayed
8010,_QUINTIAN._,"By antiquarian taste, to trust these men      2300"
8011,_QUINTIAN._,Against advice and warning ...
8012,_QUINTIAN._,
8013,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._                   Ah! thou sayest
8014,_QUINTIAN._,Against advice. Who warned thee?
8015,_QUINTIAN._,
8016,_QUINTIAN._,"_Luc._                     Cæsar, I said ..."
8017,_QUINTIAN._,
8018,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ner._ Sir, I will know who warned thee of this plot,"
8019,_QUINTIAN._,And warned not me.
8020,_QUINTIAN._,
8021,_QUINTIAN._,"_Luc._       Sire, I meant not so much."
8022,_QUINTIAN._,
8023,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._ We heard thee.
8024,_QUINTIAN._,
8025,_QUINTIAN._,"_Luc._          I make appeal to Rufus, whether"
8026,_QUINTIAN._,I must betray the innocent.
8027,_QUINTIAN._,
8028,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._                If thou look
8029,_QUINTIAN._,For thine own pardon.
8030,_QUINTIAN._,
8031,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._          We can make thee speak.
8032,_QUINTIAN._,
8033,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ruf._ Tell us, sir, who these wondrous patriots were,"
8034,_QUINTIAN._,Who set thy private safety above Cæsar’s.
8035,_QUINTIAN._,
8036,_QUINTIAN._,"_Luc._ If Cæsar bids me speak, I may hide nothing."
8037,_QUINTIAN._,"I will confess it was my mother, Atilia,"
8038,_QUINTIAN._,Who warned me against these men. Punish not her
8039,_QUINTIAN._,For not betraying her son.
8040,_QUINTIAN._,
8041,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ner._               Nay, sir, but thee"
8042,_QUINTIAN._,Who in this bungle of prevarication
8043,_QUINTIAN._,Betrayest thine own mother. Judge!
8044,_QUINTIAN._,
8045,_QUINTIAN._,_Ruf._                       Arrest him.
8046,_QUINTIAN._,
8047,_QUINTIAN._,"_Luc._ I am arrested, Cæsar, not condemned."
8048,_QUINTIAN._,
8049,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._ Thou’lt see. Stand by!—(_To Tigell._) Another woman! why
8050,_QUINTIAN._,Comes not Epicharis?
8051,_QUINTIAN._,
8052,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._         I know no cause
8053,_QUINTIAN._,For the delay. I’ll send again.
8054,_QUINTIAN._,
8055,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._                    Do so.
8056,_QUINTIAN._,"(_To Scevinus._)  Go on, sir: who is next?"
8057,_QUINTIAN._,
8058,_QUINTIAN._,_Sce._                               Plautius Lateranus.
8059,_QUINTIAN._,
8060,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._ Plautius Lateranus! Have more care
8061,_QUINTIAN._,Whom thou accusest. This is one bounden to me
8062,_QUINTIAN._,By special favours: from disgrace I raised him
8063,_QUINTIAN._,"To sit among the senate, and now he is chosen"
8064,_QUINTIAN._,Consul.
8065,_QUINTIAN._,
8066,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._  Dost thou denounce him?
8067,_QUINTIAN._,
8068,_QUINTIAN._,"_Sce._                    I do, my lord.      2325"
8069,_QUINTIAN._,
8070,_QUINTIAN._,"_Ner._ Whom then can Cæsar trust? Judge, Rufus, judge!"
8071,_QUINTIAN._,
8072,_QUINTIAN._,_Tig._ Judge!
8073,_QUINTIAN._,
8074,_QUINTIAN._,_Ruf._        Let him be arrested.
8075,_QUINTIAN._,
8076,_QUINTIAN._,_Ner._                       Send to his house.
8077,_QUINTIAN._,
8078,_QUINTIAN._,_Enter an Officer._
8079,_QUINTIAN._,
8080,_OFFICER._,_OFFICER._
8081,_OFFICER._,
8082,_OFFICER._,"Cæsar, being sent to arrest Calpurnius Piso,"
8083,_OFFICER._,We found him dead.
8084,_OFFICER._,
8085,_OFFICER._,_Ruf._       Dead! how?
8086,_OFFICER._,
8087,_OFFICER._,_Ner._                  Is Piso dead?
8088,_OFFICER._,
8089,_OFFICER._,_Fla._ (_to Rufus_). See how thou hast ruined all!
8090,_OFFICER._,
8091,_OFFICER._,_Ruf._ (_to Flavus_).                              Speak not to me!
8092,_OFFICER._,
8093,_OFFICER._,_Off._ He died by his own hand as we arrived.
8094,_OFFICER._,I viewed the body.
8095,_OFFICER._,
8096,_OFFICER._,_Tig._       He must have killed himself
8097,_OFFICER._,To escape the confiscation.
8098,_OFFICER._,
8099,_OFFICER._,_Ner._                Bah! he hath robbed
8100,_OFFICER._,The treasury.
8101,_OFFICER._,
8102,_OFFICER._,_Tig._        We shall have pickings yet.
8103,_OFFICER._,
8104,_OFFICER._,"_Ruf._ Cæsar, the untimely suicide of the accused"
8105,_OFFICER._,Confirms the charge against him in so far
8106,_OFFICER._,As he hath declined to meet it. But the trial
8107,_OFFICER._,Falls to the ground: we lose both the defence
8108,_OFFICER._,And the chief witness.
8109,_OFFICER._,
8110,_OFFICER._,_Ner._           Not so. My chief object
8111,_OFFICER._,"Remains, and my chief witness.—(_To Tig._) Where is Epicharis?"
8112,_OFFICER._,
8113,_OFFICER._,_Tig._ I see a litter passing ’neath the trees.
8114,_OFFICER._,
8115,_OFFICER._,"_Ner._ Meet them, and bring her in.—"
8116,_OFFICER._,
8117,_OFFICER._,[_Exit Tigellinus._
8118,_OFFICER._,
8119,_OFFICER._,I now produce a woman in the court.
8120,_OFFICER._,"Her name Epicharis: she lives at Naples,"
8121,_OFFICER._,And there was used by the conspirators
8122,_OFFICER._,To tamper with the navy: the Admiral
8123,_OFFICER._,"Arrested her; but she, being charged before me,"
8124,_OFFICER._,"Turned off suspicion with a specious tale,"
8125,_OFFICER._,"Which I more readily believed, because"
8126,_OFFICER._,"I hate informers, nor will lightly think                        2350"
8127,_OFFICER._,Evil of anyone. Senecio
8128,_OFFICER._,"Confirmed her story, but hath since confessed"
8129,_OFFICER._,"He knew it false: himself, as he affirms,"
8130,_OFFICER._,Was not in Piso’s confidence; this woman
8131,_OFFICER._,Knew all. Now Piso towards Senecio
8132,_OFFICER._,"Trusted too much in trusting but a little,"
8133,_OFFICER._,Trusting Epicharis much he trusted well:
8134,_OFFICER._,"For in the extreme of torture she hath not flinched,"
8135,_OFFICER._,Nor given a sound: but seeing her silence now
8136,_OFFICER._,"Confuted by so many tongues, she hath yielded,"
8137,_OFFICER._,"And promised to speak truth. See, here she is."
8138,_OFFICER._,
8139,_OFFICER._,"_During this speech Epicharis has been borne in on the litter, and is"
8140,_OFFICER._,set down at the centre of the stage._
8141,_OFFICER._,
8142,_OFFICER._,Her speech shall now unmask what traitorous faces
8143,_OFFICER._,Still screen their villany.
8144,_OFFICER._,
8145,_OFFICER._,"_Ruf._                A woman, Cæsar;"
8146,_OFFICER._,"And in the pangs of torture, and fear of death!"
8147,_OFFICER._,What evidence is this?
8148,_OFFICER._,
8149,_OFFICER._,_Ner._           What would ye object?
8150,_OFFICER._,
8151,_OFFICER._,_Ruf._ Shall Romans have their free lives played with thus?
8152,_OFFICER._,
8153,_OFFICER._,"_Ner._ What puts thee in fear? Silence!—Epicharis,"
8154,_OFFICER._,I bid thee now speak truth before the court.
8155,_OFFICER._,Piso is dead. Thou seest thy comrades taken.
8156,_OFFICER._,Truth may not save thy life: yet speak the truth
8157,_OFFICER._,As thy last hope. Let no man interrupt her.
8158,_OFFICER._,
8159,_OFFICER._,_EPICHARIS_ (_speaks from the litter_).
8160,_OFFICER._,
8161,_OFFICER._,"Cæsar, I thank thee that in all my torture"
8162,_OFFICER._,Thou hast spared my tongue to tell thee truth at last:
8163,_OFFICER._,That I am admitted where my free confession
8164,_OFFICER._,"May reach the public ear, nay not denied      2375"
8165,_OFFICER._,"Thine own ear, and for that I thank thee most;"
8166,_OFFICER._,And for my torture I thank thee too: ’tis proved
8167,_OFFICER._,"I speak not lightly, and must be well believed."
8168,_OFFICER._,"Thou bidst me, mighty Cæsar, tell thee truth:"
8169,_OFFICER._,Weak is my tongue to tell the mighty truths
8170,_OFFICER._,"Cæsar dare hear, and none hath dared to tell:"
8171,_OFFICER._,And I die ... hearken quickly. Of all thou seest
8172,_OFFICER._,There is not one whom thou canst trust: all hate thee ...
8173,_OFFICER._,"Yet needst thou not, great Cæsar, fear them much;"
8174,_OFFICER._,"For all are cowards: nay, there is not among them"
8175,_OFFICER._,"One brave enough to kill thee. And yet again,"
8176,_OFFICER._,"Great Cæsar, I counsel thee to fear them too;"
8177,_OFFICER._,For all the world ’gainst one will have their way.
8178,_OFFICER._,I know thou fear’st. Then who is most thy foe?
8179,_OFFICER._,"Whom first to kill? That I can tell thee, Cæsar:"
8180,_OFFICER._,"For none of all thou seest, or ever saw’st,"
8181,_OFFICER._,"Or wilt see again, nay, not thy murdered mother,"
8182,_OFFICER._,"Thy poisoned brother, thy beheaded wife,"
8183,_OFFICER._,Whose bloody ghosts watch on the banks of hell
8184,_OFFICER._,"To mark thy doom, none hateth thee as I,"
8185,_OFFICER._,"Defieth thee as I, curseth thee as I."
8186,_OFFICER._,"O emperor of the world, thine hour is come."
8187,_OFFICER._,Within thy cankered soul dwell side by side
8188,_OFFICER._,Remorse and vanity to drive thee mad:
8189,_OFFICER._,"The grecian furies hound thee, the christian devils"
8190,_OFFICER._,"Dispute for thee. Fly to thy dunghill, Cæsar,      2401"

8319,_TIGELLINUS._,"Shall the Sicilian eagle swoop to-night,"
8320,_TIGELLINUS._,"As on a flying hare. Poppæa, in this"
8321,_TIGELLINUS._,"My keen ally, hunts with me eagerly."
8322,_TIGELLINUS._,
8323,_TIGELLINUS._,_Enter Nero and Poppæa._
8324,_TIGELLINUS._,
8325,_TIGELLINUS._,"Hail, mighty Cæsar! fairest Augusta, hail! (_They salute._)"
8326,_TIGELLINUS._,The assassin hath not hurt thy spirits?

8328,_NERO._,_NERO._
8329,_NERO._,
8330,_NERO._,"Fear not,"
8331,_NERO._,I have dined.
8332,_NERO._,
8333,_NERO._,"_Tig._        Dined well, I pray the gods."
8334,_NERO._,
8335,_NERO._,_Ner._                               Superbly.—
8336,_NERO._,We sent to speak with thee of Seneca;
8337,_NERO._,What should be done.
8338,_NERO._,
8339,_NERO._,_Tig._         What hath been done already?
8340,_NERO._,
8341,_NERO._,"_Ner._ Hark, I will tell thee. I sent a letter to him,"
8342,_NERO._,Pressing the information of Natalis;—
8343,_NERO._,"‘Why, if thou knewest of this plot’—I said—"
8344,_NERO._,"‘Didst not thou warn me? And if thou knewest not,"
8345,_NERO._,What was thy reason why thou didst refuse
8346,_NERO._,"Audience to Piso, alleging that such meetings"
8347,_NERO._,"Were good for neither; adding also, _I hold"
8348,_NERO._,Thy life needful for mine_?’ Now I await
8349,_NERO._,His answer.
8350,_NERO._,
8351,_NERO._,_Tig._      The tribune is returned.
8352,_NERO._,
8353,_NERO._,_Ner._                         Impossible;
8354,_NERO._,Seneca is in Campania.
8355,_NERO._,
8356,_NERO._,"_Tig._           Nay, your majesty;"
8357,_NERO._,"He is in the suburbs: he returned to-day,"
8358,_NERO._,Trusting his wit before his innocence.
8359,_NERO._,
8360,_NERO._,"_Ner._ Go, fetch the tribune in.                 [_Exit Tigellinus._"
8361,_NERO._,
8362,_POPPÆA._,_POPPÆA._
8363,_POPPÆA._,
8364,_POPPÆA._,Why dally thus?
8365,_POPPÆA._,
8366,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ I dally not: I go the shortest way
8367,_POPPÆA._,To find if he be guilty.
8368,_POPPÆA._,
8369,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._             Stick you at that?
8370,_POPPÆA._,
8371,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ Romans are free. There is no man can be touched          2475
8372,_POPPÆA._,On an unproven charge.
8373,_POPPÆA._,
8374,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._           Are you not Cæsar?
8375,_POPPÆA._,
8376,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._ Cæsar administers the law, while it"
8377,_POPPÆA._,Can minister to him.
8378,_POPPÆA._,
8379,_POPPÆA._,_Re-enter Tigellinus._
8380,_POPPÆA._,
8381,_POPPÆA._,_Tig._         Here is his answer written.
8382,_POPPÆA._,
8383,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._ Read it us, Tigellinus."
8384,_POPPÆA._,
8385,_POPPÆA._,_Tig._                   If I can ...
8386,_POPPÆA._,The letters are so pinched and shaky ... it needs
8387,_POPPÆA._,The scholarship of Cæsar.
8388,_POPPÆA._,
8389,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._              Give it to me.
8390,_POPPÆA._,"(_Reads._) ‘To Cæsar, Lucius Annæus Seneca"
8391,_POPPÆA._,Greeting ... In answer to thy message; first
8392,_POPPÆA._,’Tis true that once Natalis came to me
8393,_POPPÆA._,"From Piso, and begged that I would visit him:"
8394,_POPPÆA._,"And I excused myself on plea of sickness,"
8395,_POPPÆA._,"And need of quiet: As to the words imputed,"
8396,_POPPÆA._,"However I may prize thy safety, Cæsar,"
8397,_POPPÆA._,I have no cause to set a private person’s
8398,_POPPÆA._,"Above my own; nor do I stoop to flattery,"
8399,_POPPÆA._,As well thou knowest; nor to such shallow arts
8400,_POPPÆA._,As would hide treason in a salutation.’
8401,_POPPÆA._,
8402,_POPPÆA._,_Tig._ Is that the sum?
8403,_POPPÆA._,
8404,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._            ’Tis all. He is not guilty.
8405,_POPPÆA._,
8406,_POPPÆA._,_Tig._ Not guilty!
8407,_POPPÆA._,
8408,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._       Nay.
8409,_POPPÆA._,
8410,_POPPÆA._,"_Pop._            Why, he confesses it."
8411,_POPPÆA._,
8412,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ I know the man: his mind is here at ease.
8413,_POPPÆA._,The style is pithy and careless. When he has aught
8414,_POPPÆA._,"To excuse, he is wordy."
8415,_POPPÆA._,
8416,_POPPÆA._,_Tig._            He was wordy enough
8417,_POPPÆA._,"In the matter of Agrippina, true."
8418,_POPPÆA._,
8419,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._                      Well, sir!"
8420,_POPPÆA._,
8421,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._ And in the matter of Britannicus.
8422,_POPPÆA._,
8423,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._ Why raise these matters now?                             2500
8424,_POPPÆA._,
8425,_POPPÆA._,_Tig._                        These are the matters
8426,_POPPÆA._,That Seneca harps on: while he lives they live.
8427,_POPPÆA._,
8428,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._ These are the deeds Epicharis charged against thee.
8429,_POPPÆA._,
8430,_POPPÆA._,_Tig._ This was the root of Flavus’ hate.
8431,_POPPÆA._,
8432,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._                              ’Tis this
8433,_POPPÆA._,"The people mean, who whisper when I pass,"
8434,_POPPÆA._,"‘Octavia, Octavia.’"
8435,_POPPÆA._,
8436,_POPPÆA._,_Tig._        And he now persuades
8437,_POPPÆA._,"Half Rome ’twas not himself who did these things,"
8438,_POPPÆA._,"But thou ... which thou, permitting him to live,"
8439,_POPPÆA._,"Indorsest with thy name; dost set, I say,"
8440,_POPPÆA._,The imperial warrant on the black account:
8441,_POPPÆA._,As orphans sign away their patrimony
8442,_POPPÆA._,To scheming uncles; as unwitting pupils
8443,_POPPÆA._,To crafty tutors fall a prey.
8444,_POPPÆA._,
8445,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._                  One lesson
8446,_POPPÆA._,"He taught me perfectly, that is to hate him."
8447,_POPPÆA._,
8448,_POPPÆA._,"_Pop._ Thy hate and love go by half measures, Nero."
8449,_POPPÆA._,
8450,_POPPÆA._,"_Tig._ ’Twere pretty, Cæsar, wert thou a private person,"
8451,_POPPÆA._,To play the philosopher upon the man
8452,_POPPÆA._,Who led thee astray—albeit to sacrifice
8453,_POPPÆA._,"Thy wife and friend,—if he who saved thy life"
8454,_POPPÆA._,May style himself thy friend ...
8455,_POPPÆA._,
8456,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._                     Yes, friend; thou savedst"
8457,_POPPÆA._,My life to-day.
8458,_POPPÆA._,
8459,_POPPÆA._,"_Tig._    And yet saved not, if thou                            2520"
8460,_POPPÆA._,"Wilt throw it straight away, and with thy saviour’s."
8461,_POPPÆA._,
8462,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._ Stay, I am resolved: I will not vex you further:"
8463,_POPPÆA._,"I yield. I know there is no man in the world,"
8464,_POPPÆA._,"Nor ever was, but hath his flaw: In some"
8465,_POPPÆA._,"’Tis a foul blot, that in the eye of nature"
8466,_POPPÆA._,Stands out unpardonable and unredeemed
8467,_POPPÆA._,"By all the school of virtues, howsoe’er"
8468,_POPPÆA._,They dance in grace around it: In another
8469,_POPPÆA._,"’Tis like a beauty-mark, a starry mole"
8470,_POPPÆA._,Which on a virgin’s body but sets off                           2530
8471,_POPPÆA._,"The dazzling flesh, that else were self-extinguished"
8472,_POPPÆA._,"In its own fairness.—Yet by these flecks and flaws,"
8473,_POPPÆA._,"Whate’er they be, ’tis fated that men fall:"
8474,_POPPÆA._,"And thus may I, nay must; unless in time"
8475,_POPPÆA._,"I heed good warning, for my fault is gross."
8476,_POPPÆA._,I am over-generous; yes; ye say it; I know it.
8477,_POPPÆA._,That is my flaw. It is because my schemes
8478,_POPPÆA._,"Are wider than his own, that Seneca hates me:"
8479,_POPPÆA._,Because the world hath tasted more of freedom
8480,_POPPÆA._,Under my rule than under any Cæsar
8481,_POPPÆA._,Who went before—and that can no man question—
8482,_POPPÆA._,"It is for this my throne hath more been envied,"
8483,_POPPÆA._,"And by more plots and treacheries besieged,"
8484,_POPPÆA._,Than ever others were: and when I saw
8485,_POPPÆA._,(My safety and the people’s good being one)
8486,_POPPÆA._,I must make holocaust of private feelings
8487,_POPPÆA._,"To that which helped the whole, then ’twas for that"
8488,_POPPÆA._,"The bungling crowd condemned me, & where I looked"
8489,_POPPÆA._,"For gratitude to be my consolation,"
8490,_POPPÆA._,"I met reproach. ’Twas Seneca, ye say,                           2550"
8491,_POPPÆA._,Who did those things. ’Tis true those deeds were his
8492,_POPPÆA._,"In reason and connivence; but in the act,"
8493,_POPPÆA._,"Doing and suffering they were mine, and are."
8494,_POPPÆA._,"Yet now, if he withdraw his countenance,"
8495,_POPPÆA._,"Condemn, wear vulgar horror on his face,"
8496,_POPPÆA._,"And turn men’s hearts against me, what could move"
8497,_POPPÆA._,My anger more if I were vain or cruel?
8498,_POPPÆA._,"No. Have your will;—and if I hinder not,"
8499,_POPPÆA._,He cannot blame me; since I do but play
8500,_POPPÆA._,Seneca to your Cæsar.
8501,_POPPÆA._,
8502,_POPPÆA._,"_Tig._          I thank thee, sire."
8503,_POPPÆA._,He dies to-night; or shall we wait to have him
8504,_POPPÆA._,Compose the palliation?
8505,_POPPÆA._,
8506,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._            Jest not; ’tis done.                  [_Exit Tig._
8507,_POPPÆA._,
8508,_POPPÆA._,"_Pop._ You have talked too long, Nero; come in & rest."
8509,_POPPÆA._,
8510,_POPPÆA._,"_Ner._ He was my tutor once, and once I loved him."
8511,_POPPÆA._,
8512,_POPPÆA._,_Pop._ You might have done it with a nod.
8513,_POPPÆA._,
8514,_POPPÆA._,_Ner._                              He is old:
8515,_POPPÆA._,I rob him not of much. The end of life
8516,_POPPÆA._,"Is tedious, I believe. Come back, Poppæa;"
8517,_POPPÆA._,"And while we are in our prime, let us be merry"
8518,_POPPÆA._,And thank the gods.                                       [_Exeunt._

8534,_SENECA._,And watch the April sunset; the mild air

8536,_SENECA._,
8537,_THRASEA._,_THRASEA._
8538,_THRASEA._,
8539,_THRASEA._,I long doubted
8540,_THRASEA._,Whether to come upon an invitation
8541,_THRASEA._,Written before these troubles.                                  2575
8542,_THRASEA._,
8543,_THRASEA._,_Sen._                   You did well
8544,_THRASEA._,Not to desert me. Fannia too shall comfort
8545,_THRASEA._,My grieved Paullina.—Here is the best wine
8546,_THRASEA._,Of all my vineyards: drink to my long journey:—
8547,_THRASEA._,But first remember solemnly our friends
8548,_THRASEA._,Who have already died to-day: I pour
8549,_THRASEA._,"This cup to them, and specially must name"
8550,_THRASEA._,My nephew Lucan.
8551,_THRASEA._,
8552,_THRASEA._,_Thr._     ’Tis an ancient custom.
8553,_THRASEA._,
8554,_THRASEA._,_Sen._ (_offering to Thrasea_).          And should be kept.
8555,_THRASEA._,
8556,_THRASEA._,_Thr._ (_taking and sprinkling_). I’ll name the gentle Piso.
8557,_THRASEA._,
8558,_THRASEA._,_PRISCUS_ (_taking from Thrasea_).
8559,_THRASEA._,
8560,_THRASEA._,This to Epicharis.      (_Sprinkling._)
8561,_THRASEA._,
8562,_THRASEA._,"_Thr._         Well spoken, son."
8563,_THRASEA._,No better wish than that we all may die
8564,_THRASEA._,Bravely as she.
8565,_THRASEA._,
8566,_THRASEA._,_Sen._    So be it! Now let us sit.      (_They sit._)
8567,_THRASEA._,"And I between (_sitting_). I would so spend this hour,."
8568,_THRASEA._,"That ye shall not forget it in after-days,"
8569,_THRASEA._,"When ye think of me. ’Tis the last time, friends,"
8570,_THRASEA._,That ye will sup with me.
8571,_THRASEA._,
8572,_THRASEA._,"_Pr._               Nay, say not so:"
8573,_THRASEA._,I trust you have escaped.
8574,_THRASEA._,
8575,_THRASEA._,_Sen._              Look on yon sun:
8576,_THRASEA._,An hour hence he will set; and now he sinks
8577,_THRASEA._,Smiling eternal promises. Ye both
8578,_THRASEA._,"Shall see him rise, but I—I shall not see it."
8579,_THRASEA._,"This tree shall hang its branches, and another"
8580,_THRASEA._,May sit and comfort his poetic sadness.
8581,_THRASEA._,"As I have done, only not I: I only"
8582,_THRASEA._,"Not here ... not there, where I have been: all things"
8583,_THRASEA._,"Have hitherto existed with me, henceforth"
8584,_THRASEA._,All will exist without me.
8585,_THRASEA._,
8586,_THRASEA._,_Pr._                Have more hope.                            2600
8587,_THRASEA._,
8588,_THRASEA._,"_Sen._ Nay, it is so; what else could Cæsar mean?"
8589,_THRASEA._,
8590,_THRASEA._,_Thr._ Your answer may convince him.
8591,_THRASEA._,
8592,_THRASEA._,"_Sen._                         Nay, good Thrasea;"
8593,_THRASEA._,These be the last hours of my life: I’d say
8594,_THRASEA._,"To you, my friends, what I have most at heart."
8595,_THRASEA._,And first rejoice with me that I depart
8596,_THRASEA._,"With all my senses perfect, not as some,"
8597,_THRASEA._,Tortured by pain and praying for release;
8598,_THRASEA._,"Nor like a man, who walking in the dark,"
8599,_THRASEA._,"Comes to a brink upright, and steppeth over"
8600,_THRASEA._,"Unhesitatingly, because he knows not."
8601,_THRASEA._,"Nor is my term much shortened, I shall die"
8602,_THRASEA._,"Like aged Socrates, and with his hope"
8603,_THRASEA._,That the spirit doth not perish;—I mean not
8604,_THRASEA._,A senseless immortality of fame:
8605,_THRASEA._,"That I shall have, but more I’ll have; I dream"
8606,_THRASEA._,"Of life in which I may be Seneca again,"
8607,_THRASEA._,Seneca still.
8608,_THRASEA._,
8609,_THRASEA._,"_Thr._ Now if thou couldst convince us,"
8610,_THRASEA._,"Seneca, of that, ’twere worthy thy last hour."
8611,_THRASEA._,"Teach me to picture what thou thinkst to see,"
8612,_THRASEA._,That land betwixt oblivion and regret;
8613,_THRASEA._,Where is’t? how is it?
8614,_THRASEA._,
8615,_THRASEA._,_Sen._           It lies not in the scope
8616,_THRASEA._,"Of demonstration, Thrasea; but my heart"
8617,_THRASEA._,Bears witness to it: the best that I could say
8618,_THRASEA._,"Is in my books. What all mankind desires,"
8619,_THRASEA._,The mind requires; what it requires believes:                   2625
8620,_THRASEA._,"And calls it truth. I hold that one God made us,"
8621,_THRASEA._,And at our death receives our spirits kindly:
8622,_THRASEA._,We shall meet elsewhere those whom we leave here.
8623,_THRASEA._,
8624,_THRASEA._,"_Pr._ This will not comfort Romans: Nero again,"
8625,_THRASEA._,And Tigellinus....
8626,_THRASEA._,
8627,_THRASEA._,_Sen._       Why may there not be
8628,_THRASEA._,"Distinction, Priscus, as old fables tell;"
8629,_THRASEA._,"Rewards for good, and punishments for ill?"
8630,_THRASEA._,"The myths are gross and brutal, but philosophy"
8631,_THRASEA._,Finds reason in religion.
8632,_THRASEA._,
8633,_THRASEA._,"_Thr._              Then the vulgar,"
8634,_THRASEA._,"’Gainst whom you have waged your philosophic war,"
8635,_THRASEA._,Hold the last truth.
8636,_THRASEA._,
8637,_THRASEA._,_Sen._         The sanction of all truth
8638,_THRASEA._,Lies in our common nature. A religion
8639,_THRASEA._,Based on the truth of what all men desire
8640,_THRASEA._,Must carry all before it.
8641,_THRASEA._,
8642,_THRASEA._,_Thr._              But you said
8643,_THRASEA._,Philosophy found reason in religion.
8644,_THRASEA._,What is your ground?
8645,_THRASEA._,
8646,_THRASEA._,"_Sen._         My first is this, that else"
8647,_THRASEA._,All were unjust. It needs a second life
8648,_THRASEA._,To set this even.
8649,_THRASEA._,
8650,_THRASEA._,_Thr._      You have not found in life
8651,_THRASEA._,Its own reward?
8652,_THRASEA._,
8653,_THRASEA._,"_Sen._    Nay, I have not."
8654,_THRASEA._,
8655,_THRASEA._,_Thr._                     I know not
8656,_THRASEA._,"If ’tis not sadder, this profound impeachment"
8657,_THRASEA._,"Of God’s whole constitution as we see it,"
8658,_THRASEA._,Than the belief that death’s our end of all.
8659,_THRASEA._,To live in conscious harmony with nature
8660,_THRASEA._,May satisfy our being; but religion
8661,_THRASEA._,Looks like the poetry which childhood makes                     2650
8662,_THRASEA._,"To cloke its empty terrors, or bedizen"
8663,_THRASEA._,Its painted idols: such is my persuasion.
8664,_THRASEA._,
8665,_THRASEA._,_Pr._ And mine.
8666,_THRASEA._,
8667,_THRASEA._,"_Sen._    Ah, Priscus, thou art young. I once"
8668,_THRASEA._,"Looked forward into life with a proud heart,"
8669,_THRASEA._,Nor saw the exigency and irony

8834,NOTE I.,NOTE I.
8835,NOTE I.,
8836,NOTE I.,This attempt to give _Menander_ to the english stage is based Upon his
8837,NOTE I.,"‘Heautontimorumenos’ as we know it through _Terence_. That play, though"
8838,NOTE I.,"marked by roman taste, is a work of high excellence; but as it stands"
8839,NOTE I.,"would be unpresentable to a christian audience, chiefly on account of"
8840,NOTE I.,"the story of _Antiphila’s_ exposure, which must deprive _Chremes_ of"
8841,NOTE I.,"sympathy. And, since the liberties which _Terence_ took with _Menander_"
8842,NOTE I.,"cannot be determined, it was but mannerly to extend the necessary"
8843,NOTE I.,"alteration, and suppress the slaves with their tedious and difficult"
8844,NOTE I.,"intrigue. Thus altered, only about one-sixth of the latin original"
8845,NOTE I.,remains; and the play is perhaps not so sound in plot as _Terence_
8846,NOTE I.,"made it, and is still weighted with the badness of his _Bacchis_"
8847,NOTE I.,[_Gorgo_]; but it has the advantage of being more easily followed. The
8848,NOTE I.,construction of the modern stage required the opening change. All that
8849,NOTE I.,"is beautiful in _Terence_, and therefore possibly most of what was"
8850,NOTE I.,"_Menander’s_, has been carefully preserved; and some extant fragments"
8851,NOTE I.,of his have also found a lodging.
8852,NOTE I.,
8853,NOTE I.,"The metre is a line of six stresses, written according to rules of"
8854,NOTE I.,english rhythm; and its correspondence with the latin comic trimeter
8855,NOTE I.,"iambic is an accident. Whatever a stress may carry, it should never"
8856,NOTE I.,"be made to carry more than one long syllable with it,—the comic vein"
8857,NOTE I.,allowing some license as to what is reckoned as long;—but as there
8858,NOTE I.,"are no conventional, or merely metric stresses (except sometimes in"
8859,NOTE I.,"the sixth place; and in the third, when the midverse break usual in"
8860,NOTE I.,"english six-stressed verse is observed, or that place is occupied by a"
8861,NOTE I.,"proper name), the accompanying long and short syllables may have very"
8862,NOTE I.,varied relation of position with regard to their carrying stress. Where
8863,NOTE I.,"more than four short unstressed syllables come together, a stress is"
8864,NOTE I.,distributed or lost; and in some conditions of rhythm this may occur
8865,NOTE I.,when only four short syllables come together; and this distributed
8866,NOTE I.,"stress occurs very readily in the second, fourth, and fifth places."
8867,NOTE I.,"Such at least seem some of the rhythmic laws, any infringement of which"
8868,NOTE I.,must be regarded as a fault or liberty of writing: and the best has not
8869,NOTE I.,been made of the metre. A natural emphasizing of the sense gives all
8870,NOTE I.,the rhythm that is intended.
8871,NOTE I.,
8872,NOTE I.,"The author thinks that so much explanation is due to the reader,"
8873,NOTE I.,because the verse is new. He has been told that it will be said by the
8874,NOTE I.,"critics to be prose; but that if it were printed as prose, they might"
8875,NOTE I.,pronounce it to be verse: and this is the effect aimed at; since a
8876,NOTE I.,comic metre which will admit colloquial speech without torturing it
8877,NOTE I.,must have such a loose varying rhythm.

8893,NOTE II.,"emporté cette creance, que je n’ay sceu ny l’aimer ny l’estimer selon"

8901,NOTE II.,bien prise et raisonable.’ It surprises me that Montaigne does not
8902,NOTE II.,"in this place refer to Menedemus. In the tenth essay, Des Livres, he"
8903,NOTE II.,"writes thus of Terence: ‘Quant an bon Terence, la mignardise, et les"
8904,NOTE II.,"graces du langage latin, je le trouve admirable à representer au vif"
8905,NOTE II.,"les mouvemens de l’ame, et la condition de nos mœurs: à toute heure"
8906,NOTE II.,nos actions me rejettent à luy: Je ne le puis lire si souvent que
8907,NOTE II.,je n’y treuve quelque beauté et grace nouvelle.... Sa gentilesse et
8908,NOTE II.,"sa mignardise nous retiennent par tout. Il est partout si plaisant,"

8924,"_ON ENCLITICS, ETC._","Fields, Johnson and Taylor went to see him perform, and afterwards"

8930,"_ON ENCLITICS, ETC._","Garrick and Giffard were offended at this sarcasm, and endeavoured"

8933,"_ON ENCLITICS, ETC._",shall see how just my observation is. That shall be the criterion. Let
