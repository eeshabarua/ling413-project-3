229,THEY TOLD ME,"They told me Pan was dead, but I"
230,THEY TOLD ME,Oft marvelled who it was that sang
231,THEY TOLD ME,Down the green valleys languidly
232,THEY TOLD ME,Where the grey elder-thickets hang.
233,THEY TOLD ME,
234,THEY TOLD ME,Sometimes I thought it was a bird
235,THEY TOLD ME,My soul had charged with sorcery;
236,THEY TOLD ME,Sometimes it seemed my own heart heard
237,THEY TOLD ME,Inland the sorrow of the sea.
238,THEY TOLD ME,
239,THEY TOLD ME,But even where the primrose sets
240,THEY TOLD ME,"The seal of her pale loveliness,"
241,THEY TOLD ME,I found amid the violets
242,THEY TOLD ME,Tears of an antique bitterness.

255,SORCERY,
256,SORCERY,"""What song is it he sings,"
257,SORCERY,Echoing from afar;

260,SORCERY,"Beneath the brightening star?"""
261,SORCERY,
262,SORCERY,"The woodman answered me,"
263,SORCERY,His faggot on his back:--
264,SORCERY,"""Seek not the face of Pan to see;"
265,SORCERY,Flee from his clear note summoning thee
266,SORCERY,"To darkness deep and black!"""
267,SORCERY,
268,SORCERY,"""He dwells in thickest shade,"
269,SORCERY,Piping his notes forlorn
270,SORCERY,Of sorrow never to be allayed;

272,SORCERY,"Of twilight unto morn!"""
273,SORCERY,
274,SORCERY,The woodman passed away
275,SORCERY,Along the forest path;
276,SORCERY,His ax shone keen and grey
277,SORCERY,In the last beams of day:
278,SORCERY,And all was still as death:--
279,SORCERY,
280,SORCERY,Only Pan singing sweet
281,SORCERY,Out of Earth's fragrant shade;
282,SORCERY,"I dreamed his eyes to meet,"
283,SORCERY,And found but shadow laid
284,SORCERY,Before my tired feet.
285,SORCERY,
286,SORCERY,"Comes no more dawn to me,"
287,SORCERY,Nor bird of open skies.
288,SORCERY,Only his woods' deep gloom I see
289,SORCERY,"Till, at the end of all, shall rise,"
290,SORCERY,"Afar and tranquilly,"
291,SORCERY,Death's stretching sea.

297,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,
298,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,
299,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Winter is fallen early
300,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,On the house of Stare;
301,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Birds in reverberating flocks
302,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Haunt its ancestral box;
303,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Bright are the plenteous berries
304,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,In clusters in the air.
305,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,
306,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,"Still is the fountain's music,"
307,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,"The dark pool icy still,"
308,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Whereupon a small and sanguine sun
309,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,"Floats in a mirror on,"
310,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,"Into a West of crimson,"
311,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,From a South of daffodil.
312,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,
313,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,'Tis strange to see young children
314,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,In such a wintry house;
315,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Like rabbits' on the frozen snow
316,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Their tell-tale footprints go;
317,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Their laughter rings like timbrels
318,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,'Neath evening ominous:
319,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,
320,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Their small and heightened faces
321,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Like wine-red winter buds;
322,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Their frolic bodies gentle as
323,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,"Flakes in the air that pass,"
324,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Frail as the twirling petal
325,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,From the briar of the woods.
326,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,
327,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,"Above them silence lours,"
328,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Still as an arctic sea;
329,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Light fails; night falls; the wintry moon
330,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Glitters; the crocus soon
331,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Will ope grey and distracted
332,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,On earth's austerity:
333,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,
334,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,"Thick mystery, wild peril,"
335,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Law like an iron rod:--
336,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,"Yet sport they on in Spring's attire,"
337,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Each with his tiny fire
338,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,Blown to a core of ardour
339,THE CHILDREN OF STARE,By the awful breath of God.

347,AGE,This ugly old crone--
348,AGE,Every beauty she had
349,AGE,"When a maid, when a maid."
350,AGE,"Her beautiful eyes,"
351,AGE,"Too youthful, too wise,"
352,AGE,Seemed ever to come
353,AGE,"To so lightless a home,"
354,AGE,Cold and dull as a stone.
355,AGE,And her cheeks--who would guess
356,AGE,Cheeks cadaverous as this
357,AGE,Once with colours were gay
358,AGE,As the flower on its spray?
359,AGE,Who would ever believe
360,AGE,Aught could bring one to grieve
361,AGE,So much as to make
362,AGE,Lips bent for love's sake
363,AGE,So thin and so grey?
364,AGE,"O Youth, come away!"
365,AGE,"As she asks in her lone,"
366,AGE,"This old, desolate crone."
367,AGE,She loves us no more;
368,AGE,She is too old to care
369,AGE,For the charms that of yore
370,AGE,Made her body so fair.
371,AGE,"Past repining, past care,"
372,AGE,She lives but to bear
373,AGE,One or two fleeting years
374,AGE,Earth's indifference: her tears
375,AGE,Have lost now their heat;
376,AGE,Her hands and her feet
377,AGE,Now shake but to be
378,AGE,Shed as leaves from a tree;
379,AGE,And her poor heart beats on
380,AGE,Like a sea--the storm gone.

388,THE GLIMPSE,Art thou asleep? or have thy wings
389,THE GLIMPSE,Wearied of my unchanging skies?
390,THE GLIMPSE,"Or, haply, is it fading dreams"
391,THE GLIMPSE,Are in my eyes?
392,THE GLIMPSE,
393,THE GLIMPSE,Not even an echo in my heart
394,THE GLIMPSE,"Tells me the courts thy feet trod last,"
395,THE GLIMPSE,"Bare as a leafless wood it is,"
396,THE GLIMPSE,The summer past.
397,THE GLIMPSE,
398,THE GLIMPSE,My inmost mind is like a book
399,THE GLIMPSE,"The reader dulls with lassitude,"
400,THE GLIMPSE,Wherein the same old lovely words
401,THE GLIMPSE,Sound poor and rude.
402,THE GLIMPSE,
403,THE GLIMPSE,"Yet through this vapid surface, I"
404,THE GLIMPSE,"Seem to see old-time deeps; I see,"
405,THE GLIMPSE,"Past the dark painting of the hour,"
406,THE GLIMPSE,Life's ecstasy.
407,THE GLIMPSE,
408,THE GLIMPSE,Only a moment; as when day
409,THE GLIMPSE,"Is set, and in the shade of night,"
410,THE GLIMPSE,"Through all the clouds that compassed her,"
411,THE GLIMPSE,Stoops into sight
412,THE GLIMPSE,
413,THE GLIMPSE,"Pale, changeless, everlasting Dian,"
414,THE GLIMPSE,"Gleams on the prone Endymion,"
415,THE GLIMPSE,Troubles the dulness of his dreams:
416,THE GLIMPSE,And then is gone.

426,REMEMBRANCE,"Clear, tranquil, beautiful,"
427,REMEMBRANCE,"Dark, forlorn."
428,REMEMBRANCE,
429,REMEMBRANCE,Lightning along its margin ran;
430,REMEMBRANCE,A rumour of the sea
431,REMEMBRANCE,Rose in profundity and sank
432,REMEMBRANCE,Into infinity.
433,REMEMBRANCE,
434,REMEMBRANCE,"Lofty and few the elms, the stars"
435,REMEMBRANCE,In the vast boughs most bright;
436,REMEMBRANCE,I stood a dreamer in a dream
437,REMEMBRANCE,In the unstirring night.
438,REMEMBRANCE,
439,REMEMBRANCE,"Not wonder, worship, not even peace"
440,REMEMBRANCE,Seemed in my heart to be:
441,REMEMBRANCE,"Only the memory of one,"
442,REMEMBRANCE,Of all most dead to me.

449,TREACHERY,
450,TREACHERY,She had amid her ringlets bound
451,TREACHERY,Green leaves to rival their dark hue;
452,TREACHERY,How could such locks with beauty bound
453,TREACHERY,"Dry up their dew,"
454,TREACHERY,Wither them through and through?
455,TREACHERY,
456,TREACHERY,She had within her dark eyes lit
457,TREACHERY,Sweet fires to burn all doubt away;
458,TREACHERY,"Yet did those fires, in darkness lit,"
459,TREACHERY,"Burn but a day,"
460,TREACHERY,Not even till twilight stay.
461,TREACHERY,
462,TREACHERY,She had within a dusk of words
463,TREACHERY,A vow in simple splendour set;
464,TREACHERY,"How, in the memory of such words,"
465,TREACHERY,Could she forget
466,TREACHERY,That vow--the soul of it?

475,IN VAIN,While yet the woods with buds were grey;
476,IN VAIN,Nought but a little child I heard
477,IN VAIN,Warbling at break of day.
478,IN VAIN,
479,IN VAIN,I knocked when June had lured her rose
480,IN VAIN,To mask the sharpness of its thorn;
481,IN VAIN,"Knocked yet again, heard only yet"
482,IN VAIN,Thee singing of the morn.
483,IN VAIN,
484,IN VAIN,The frail convolvulus had wreathed
485,IN VAIN,"Its cup, but the faint flush of eve"
486,IN VAIN,Lingered upon thy Western wall;
487,IN VAIN,Thou hadst no word to give.
488,IN VAIN,
489,IN VAIN,Once yet I came; the winter stars
490,IN VAIN,Above thy house wheeled wildly bright;
491,IN VAIN,Footsore I stood before thy door--
492,IN VAIN,Wide open into night.

499,THE MIRACLE,
500,THE MIRACLE,Who beckons the green ivy up
501,THE MIRACLE,Its solitary tower of stone?
502,THE MIRACLE,What spirit lures the bindweed's cup
503,THE MIRACLE,Unfaltering on?
504,THE MIRACLE,Calls even the starry lichen to climb
505,THE MIRACLE,By agelong inches endless Time?
506,THE MIRACLE,
507,THE MIRACLE,Who bids the hollyhock uplift
508,THE MIRACLE,Her rod of fast-sealed buds on high;
509,THE MIRACLE,"Fling wide her petals--silent, swift,"
510,THE MIRACLE,Lovely to the sky?
511,THE MIRACLE,"Since as she kindled, so she will fade,"
512,THE MIRACLE,Flower above flower in squalor laid.
513,THE MIRACLE,
514,THE MIRACLE,Ever the heavy billow rears
515,THE MIRACLE,"All its sea-length in green, hushed wall;"
516,THE MIRACLE,"But totters as the shore it nears,"
517,THE MIRACLE,Foams to its fall;
518,THE MIRACLE,Where was its mark? on what vain quest
519,THE MIRACLE,Rose that great water from its rest?
520,THE MIRACLE,
521,THE MIRACLE,So creeps ambition on; so climb
522,THE MIRACLE,"Man's vaunting thoughts. He, set on high,"
523,THE MIRACLE,"Forgets his birth, small space, brief time,"
524,THE MIRACLE,That he shall die;
525,THE MIRACLE,"Dreams blindly in his dark, still air;"
526,THE MIRACLE,Consumes his strength; strips himself bare;
527,THE MIRACLE,
528,THE MIRACLE,"Rejects delight, ease, pleasure, hope,"

1002,GLORIA MUNDI,Through a still vale of yew and almond trees.
1003,GLORIA MUNDI,

1005,GLORIA MUNDI,"Its tortured belly, One, like silver, pale,"
1006,GLORIA MUNDI,"With fingers closed upon a rope of straw,"
1007,GLORIA MUNDI,"That bound the Beast, squat neck to hoary tail;"
1008,GLORIA MUNDI,"Lonely in all that verdure faint and deep,"

1010,GLORIA MUNDI,
1011,GLORIA MUNDI,"I marvelled at the power, strength, and rage"
1012,GLORIA MUNDI,Of this poor creature in such slavery bound;
1013,GLORIA MUNDI,Tettered with worms of fear; forlorn with age;
1014,GLORIA MUNDI,Its blue wing-stumps stretched helpless on the ground;
1015,GLORIA MUNDI,"While twilight faded into darkness deep,"
1016,GLORIA MUNDI,And he who watched it piped its pangs asleep.

1025,IDLENESS,"Puffed to the huge circumference of a sigh,"
1026,IDLENESS,But past all tinge of apples long ago.
1027,IDLENESS,His boyish fingers twiddled up and down
1028,IDLENESS,The filthy remnant of a cup of physic
1029,IDLENESS,That thicked in odour all the while he stayed.
1030,IDLENESS,His eyes were sad as fishes that swim up
1031,IDLENESS,And stare upon an element not theirs
1032,IDLENESS,"Through a thin skin of shrewish water, then"
1033,IDLENESS,"Turn on a languid fin, and dip down, down,"
1034,IDLENESS,"Into unplumbed, vast, oozy deeps of dream."
1035,IDLENESS,"His stomach was his master, and proclaimed it;"
1036,IDLENESS,And never were such meagre puppets made
1037,IDLENESS,"The slaves of such a tyrant, as his thoughts"
1038,IDLENESS,Of that obese epitome of ills.
1039,IDLENESS,"Trussed up he sat, the mockery of himself;"
1040,IDLENESS,And when upon the wan green of his eye
1041,IDLENESS,"I marked the gathering lustre of a tear,"
1042,IDLENESS,"Thought I myself must weep, until I caught"
1043,IDLENESS,"A grey, smug smile of satisfaction smirch"
1044,IDLENESS,His pallid features at his misery.
1045,IDLENESS,"And laugh did I, to see the little snares"
1046,IDLENESS,He had set for pests to vex him: his great feet
1047,IDLENESS,Prisoned in greater boots; so narrow a stool
1048,IDLENESS,To seat such elephantine parts as his;
1049,IDLENESS,"Ay, and the book he read, a Hebrew Bible;"
1050,IDLENESS,"And, to incite a gross and backward wit,"

1062,GOLIATH,Rolled from the empyrean above the host:
1063,GOLIATH,"""Bid any little flea ye have come forth,"
1064,GOLIATH,"And wince at death upon my finger-nail!"""
1065,GOLIATH,He turned his large-boned face; and all his steel
1066,GOLIATH,Tossed into beams the lustre of the noon;
1067,GOLIATH,And all the shaggy horror of his locks
1068,GOLIATH,Rustled like locusts in a field of corn.
1069,GOLIATH,The meagre pupil of his shameless eye
1070,GOLIATH,Moved like a cormorant over a glassy sea.
1071,GOLIATH,"He stretched his limbs, and laughed into the air,"
1072,GOLIATH,"To feel the groaning sinews of his breast,"
1073,GOLIATH,And the long gush of his swollen arteries pause:
1074,GOLIATH,"And, nodding, wheeled, towering in all his height."
1075,GOLIATH,"Then, like a wind that hushes, gazed and saw"
1076,GOLIATH,"Down, down, far down upon the untroubled green"
1077,GOLIATH,A shepherd-boy that swung a little sling.
1078,GOLIATH,"Goliath shut his lids to drive that mote,"
1079,GOLIATH,"Which vexed the eastern azure of his eye,"
1080,GOLIATH,Out of his vision; and stared down again.
1081,GOLIATH,"Yet stood the youth there, ruddy in the flare"
1082,GOLIATH,"Of his vast shield, nor spake, nor quailed, gazed up,"
1083,GOLIATH,As one might scan a mountain to be scaled.
1084,GOLIATH,"Then, as it were, a voice unearthly still"
1085,GOLIATH,"Cried in the cavern of his bristling ear,"
1086,GOLIATH,"""His name is Death!"" ... And, like the flush"
1087,GOLIATH,"That dyes Sahara to its lifeless verge,"
1088,GOLIATH,His brows' bright brass flamed into sudden crimson;
1089,GOLIATH,"And his great spear leapt upward, lightning-like,"
1090,GOLIATH,Shaking a dreadful thunder in the air;
1091,GOLIATH,"Spun betwixt earth and sky, bright as a berg"
1092,GOLIATH,"That hoards the sunlight in a myriad spires,"
1093,GOLIATH,Crashed: and struck echo through an army's heart.
1094,GOLIATH,"Then paused Goliath, and stared down again."
1095,GOLIATH,And fleet-foot Fear from rolling orbs perceived
1096,GOLIATH,"Steadfast, unharmed, a stooping shepherd-boy"
1097,GOLIATH,Frowning upon the target of his face.
1098,GOLIATH,And wrath tossed suddenly up once more his hand;
1099,GOLIATH,And a deep groan grieved all his strength in him.
1100,GOLIATH,"He breathed; and, lost in dazzling darkness, prayed--"
1101,GOLIATH,"Besought his reins, his gloating gods, his youth:"
1102,GOLIATH,And turned to smite what he no more could see.
1103,GOLIATH,"Then sped the singing pebble-messenger,"
1104,GOLIATH,"The chosen of the Lord from Israel's brooks,"
1105,GOLIATH,"Fleet to its mark, and hollowed a light path"
1106,GOLIATH,Down to the appalling Babel of his brain.
1107,GOLIATH,And like the smoke of dreaming Souffrière
1108,GOLIATH,"Dust rose in cloud, spread wide, slow silted down"
1109,GOLIATH,Softly all softly on his armour's blaze.

1128,FALSTAFF,And leaned rheumatic rafters o'er his head--
1129,FALSTAFF,"A blowzed, prodigious man, which talked, and stared,"
1130,FALSTAFF,"And rolled, as if with purpose, a small eye"
1131,FALSTAFF,Like a sweet Cupid in a cask of wine.
1132,FALSTAFF,"I could not view his fatness for his soul,"
1133,FALSTAFF,Which peeped like harmless lightnings and was gone;
1134,FALSTAFF,As haps to voyagers of the summer air.
1135,FALSTAFF,"And when he laughed, Time trickled down those beams,"
1136,FALSTAFF,As in a glass; and when in self-defence
1137,FALSTAFF,"He puffed that paunch, and wagged that huge, Greek head,"
1138,FALSTAFF,"Nosed like a Punchinello, then it seemed"
1139,FALSTAFF,"An hundred widows swept in his small voice,"
1140,FALSTAFF,"Now tenor, and now bass of drummy war."
1141,FALSTAFF,"He smiled, compact of loam, this orchard man;"
1142,FALSTAFF,"Mused like a midnight, webbed with moonbeam snares"
1143,FALSTAFF,"Of flitting Love; woke--and a King he stood,"
1144,FALSTAFF,Whom all the world hath in sheer jest refused
1145,FALSTAFF,"For helpless laughter's sake. And then, forfend!"
1146,FALSTAFF,Bacchus and Jove reared vast Olympus there;
1147,FALSTAFF,And Pan leaned leering from Promethean eyes.

1166,MACBETH,"He held no sword, bare was his hand and clenched,"
1167,MACBETH,As if to hide the inextinguishable blood

3253,THE JOURNEY,"Her pitcher of well-water, and clear damask--"
3254,THE JOURNEY,All that the weary wish.

3256,THE JOURNEY,And the last gold beam across the green world
3257,THE JOURNEY,"Faltered and failed, as he"
3258,THE JOURNEY,Remembered his solitude and the dark night's
3259,THE JOURNEY,Inhospitality.
3260,THE JOURNEY,
3261,THE JOURNEY,And he looked upon the Witch with eyes of sorrow
3262,THE JOURNEY,In the darkening of the day;
3263,THE JOURNEY,And turned him aside into oblivion;
3264,THE JOURNEY,And the voices died away....
3265,THE JOURNEY,
3266,THE JOURNEY,And the Witch stepped down from her casement:
3267,THE JOURNEY,In the hush of night he heard
3268,THE JOURNEY,The calling and wailing in dewy thicket
3269,THE JOURNEY,Of bird to hidden bird.
3270,THE JOURNEY,
3271,THE JOURNEY,"And gloom stole all her burning crimson,"
3272,THE JOURNEY,Remote and faint in space
3273,THE JOURNEY,As stars in gathering shadow of the evening
3274,THE JOURNEY,Seemed now her phantom face.
3275,THE JOURNEY,
3276,THE JOURNEY,"And one night's rest shall be a myriad,"
3277,THE JOURNEY,Midst dreams that come and go;
3278,THE JOURNEY,"Till heedless fate, unmoved by weakness, bring him"
3279,THE JOURNEY,This same strange by-way through:
3280,THE JOURNEY,
3281,THE JOURNEY,"To the beauty of earth that fades in ashes,"
3282,THE JOURNEY,"The lips of welcome, and the eyes"
3283,THE JOURNEY,More beauteous than the feeble shine of Hesper
3284,THE JOURNEY,Lone in the lightening skies:
3285,THE JOURNEY,
3286,THE JOURNEY,Till once again the Witch's guile entreat him;
3287,THE JOURNEY,"But, worn with wisdom, he"
3288,THE JOURNEY,Steadfast and cold shall choose the dark night's
3289,THE JOURNEY,Inhospitality.

4597,THE THREE STRANGERS,
4598,THE THREE STRANGERS,"Far are those tranquil hills,"
4599,THE THREE STRANGERS,Dyed with fair evening's rose;
4600,THE THREE STRANGERS,"On urgent, secret errand bent,"
4601,THE THREE STRANGERS,A traveller goes.
4602,THE THREE STRANGERS,
4603,THE THREE STRANGERS,"Approach him strangers three,"
4604,THE THREE STRANGERS,"Barefooted, cowled; their eyes"
4605,THE THREE STRANGERS,"Scan the lone, hastening solitary"
4606,THE THREE STRANGERS,With dumb surmise.
4607,THE THREE STRANGERS,
4608,THE THREE STRANGERS,One instant in close speech
4609,THE THREE STRANGERS,With them he doth confer:
4610,THE THREE STRANGERS,"God-sped, he hasteneth on,"
4611,THE THREE STRANGERS,That anxious traveller ...
4612,THE THREE STRANGERS,
4613,THE THREE STRANGERS,I was that man--in a dream:
4614,THE THREE STRANGERS,And each world's night in vain
4615,THE THREE STRANGERS,I patient wait on sleep to unveil
4616,THE THREE STRANGERS,Those vivid hills again.
4617,THE THREE STRANGERS,
4618,THE THREE STRANGERS,Would that they three could know
4619,THE THREE STRANGERS,How yet burns on in me
4620,THE THREE STRANGERS,Love--from one lost in Paradise--
4621,THE THREE STRANGERS,For their grave courtesy.

4630,ALEXANDER,"Capped with a golden helm,"
4631,ALEXANDER,"Sate in the ages, in his floating ship,"
4632,ALEXANDER,In a dead calm.
4633,ALEXANDER,
4634,ALEXANDER,Voices of sea-maids singing
4635,ALEXANDER,Wandered across the deep:
4636,ALEXANDER,The sailors labouring on their oars
4637,ALEXANDER,"Rowed, as in sleep."
4638,ALEXANDER,
4639,ALEXANDER,"All the high pomp of Asia,"
4640,ALEXANDER,"Charmed by that siren lay,"
4641,ALEXANDER,"Out of their weary and dreaming minds,"
4642,ALEXANDER,Faded away.
4643,ALEXANDER,
4644,ALEXANDER,"Like a bold boy sate their Captain,"
4645,ALEXANDER,"His glamour withered and gone,"
4646,ALEXANDER,"In the souls of his brooding mariners,"
4647,ALEXANDER,While the song pined on.
4648,ALEXANDER,
4649,ALEXANDER,"Time, like a falling dew,"
4650,ALEXANDER,"Life, like the scene of a dream,"
4651,ALEXANDER,"Laid between slumber and slumber,"
4652,ALEXANDER,Only did seem....
4653,ALEXANDER,
4654,ALEXANDER,"O Alexander, then,"
4655,ALEXANDER,"In all us mortals too,"
4656,ALEXANDER,Wax thou not bold--too bold
4657,ALEXANDER,On the wave dark-blue!
4658,ALEXANDER,
4659,ALEXANDER,"Come the calm, infinite night,"
4660,ALEXANDER,Who then will hear

4673,THE REAWAKENING,Voices of unseen loveliness carol and sing.
4674,THE REAWAKENING,

4691,THE VACANT DAY,As I did walk in meadows green
4692,THE VACANT DAY,I heard the summer noon resound
4693,THE VACANT DAY,With call of myriad things unseen
4694,THE VACANT DAY,That leapt and crept upon the ground.
4695,THE VACANT DAY,
4696,THE VACANT DAY,High overhead the windless air
4697,THE VACANT DAY,Throbbed with the homesick coursing cry
4698,THE VACANT DAY,Of swallows that did everywhere
4699,THE VACANT DAY,Wake echo in the sky.
4700,THE VACANT DAY,
4701,THE VACANT DAY,"Beside me, too, clear waters coursed"
4702,THE VACANT DAY,"Which willow branches, lapsing low,"
4703,THE VACANT DAY,Breaking their crystal gliding forced
4704,THE VACANT DAY,To sing as they did flow.
4705,THE VACANT DAY,
4706,THE VACANT DAY,I listened; and my heart was dumb
4707,THE VACANT DAY,With praise no language could express;
4708,THE VACANT DAY,Longing in vain for him to come
4709,THE VACANT DAY,Who had breathed such blessedness
4710,THE VACANT DAY,
4711,THE VACANT DAY,"On this fair world, wherein we pass"
4712,THE VACANT DAY,So chequered and so brief a stay;
4713,THE VACANT DAY,"And yearned in spirit to learn, alas,"
4714,THE VACANT DAY,What kept him still away.

4725,THE FLIGHT,And moonbeams weave a crown--
4726,THE FLIGHT,
4727,THE FLIGHT,"A crown of flower-like light in heaven,"
4728,THE FLIGHT,Where in the hollow arch of space
4729,THE FLIGHT,"Morn's mistress dreams, and the Pleiads seven"
4730,THE FLIGHT,Stand watch about her place.
4731,THE FLIGHT,
4732,THE FLIGHT,Stand watch--O days no number keep
4733,THE FLIGHT,Of hours when this dark clay is blind.

4777,THE SCRIBE,"To write of Earth's wonders,"
4778,THE SCRIBE,"Its live, willed things,"
4779,THE SCRIBE,Flit would the ages
4780,THE SCRIBE,On soundless wings.
4781,THE SCRIBE,Ere unto Z
4782,THE SCRIBE,My pen drew nigh;
4783,THE SCRIBE,"Leviathan told,"
4784,THE SCRIBE,And the honey-fly:
4785,THE SCRIBE,And still would remain
