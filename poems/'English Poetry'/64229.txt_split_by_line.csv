42,PREFATORY NOTE,
43,PREFATORY NOTE,The object of this compilation is to provide a corpus of representative
44,PREFATORY NOTE,"parodies and imitations of a century, beginning with _Rejected"
45,PREFATORY NOTE,"Addresses_ (1812), which practically marked the birth of modern parody,"
46,PREFATORY NOTE,"and are here printed in their entirety. Prose parodies, excepting those"
47,PREFATORY NOTE,"in _Rejected Addresses_, have been excluded; the derivation of the word"
48,PREFATORY NOTE,'parody' may be referred to in justification. Emerson wrote in his
49,PREFATORY NOTE,'Fable'
50,PREFATORY NOTE,
51,PREFATORY NOTE,'----all sorts of things and weather
52,PREFATORY NOTE,Must be taken in together
53,PREFATORY NOTE,To make up a year
54,PREFATORY NOTE,And a sphere;
55,PREFATORY NOTE,
56,PREFATORY NOTE,"so in this volume will be found all forms of imitations from, in Mr."
57,PREFATORY NOTE,"Owen Seaman's words, 'the lowest, a mere verbal echo, to the highest,"
58,PREFATORY NOTE,where it becomes a department of pure criticism.'
59,PREFATORY NOTE,
60,PREFATORY NOTE,"It is quite unnecessary to add to the published mass of writing, wise"
61,PREFATORY NOTE,"and foolish, on the art and ethics of parody. Some of the pieces in"
62,PREFATORY NOTE,this book are included chiefly because they have an historical place in
63,PREFATORY NOTE,the development of parody to its present high standard of execution and
64,PREFATORY NOTE,good taste.
65,PREFATORY NOTE,
66,PREFATORY NOTE,Isaac D'Israeli asserted that 'unless the prototype is familiar to us a
67,PREFATORY NOTE,parody is nothing.' As a matter of fact some of the best work is that
68,PREFATORY NOTE,"of which the originals have been forgotten long since; although, of"
69,PREFATORY NOTE,"course, when the poets and the poems imitated are familiar the art of"
70,PREFATORY NOTE,the imitator can be better appreciated.
71,PREFATORY NOTE,
72,PREFATORY NOTE,The word 'century' has been interpreted with some licence. The work of
73,PREFATORY NOTE,"living parodists does not fall within the scope of this collection,"
74,PREFATORY NOTE,and it is a real self-denying ordinance which forbids the inclusion
75,PREFATORY NOTE,"of triumphs by Sir Frederick Pollock, Mr. Owen Seaman, Sir Arthur"
76,PREFATORY NOTE,"Quiller-Couch, Mr. Barry Pain, the Rev. Anthony Deane, and others who,"
77,PREFATORY NOTE,"in their undergraduate days, enlivened the periodicals of Oxford and"
78,PREFATORY NOTE,"Cambridge, or to-day show their dexterity in the pages of _Punch_. By"
79,PREFATORY NOTE,"way of recompense, the volume contains parodies by some, still living"
80,PREFATORY NOTE,"in 1812, whose work was published before _Rejected Addresses_. The"
81,PREFATORY NOTE,"parodies which follow therefore range from George Ellis, who was born"
82,PREFATORY NOTE,"in 1753, to Andrew Lang, who died in 1912. Very sparing use has been"
83,PREFATORY NOTE,"made of anonymous work, and in this connexion it may be well to explain"
84,PREFATORY NOTE,"that 'Adolphus Smalls of Boniface' is ruled out, because, although"
85,PREFATORY NOTE,"published anonymously, it is known to be the joint composition in their"
86,PREFATORY NOTE,"Balliol days of Dr. W. W. Merry, the Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford,"
87,PREFATORY NOTE,"and Alfred Blomfield, afterwards Bishop of Colchester."
88,PREFATORY NOTE,
89,PREFATORY NOTE,"With regard to _Rejected Addresses_, the publication of which may be"
90,PREFATORY NOTE,"said to have revived and established the art of parody, the genesis"
91,PREFATORY NOTE,of the work is sufficiently explained in the authors' prefaces and
92,PREFATORY NOTE,"notes. There were parodists before the Brothers Smith, yet their"
93,PREFATORY NOTE,"topical little volume has a lasting value, not only because of its"
94,PREFATORY NOTE,"inherent excellence, but also because it struck the note which the"
95,PREFATORY NOTE,best later exponents of the art have followed. Published in the autumn
96,PREFATORY NOTE,"of 1812, the book reached its fifteenth edition within two years,"
97,PREFATORY NOTE,and its success led to the publication of a volume of certain of the
98,PREFATORY NOTE,_Addresses_ that had really been sent to Drury Lane for competition.
99,PREFATORY NOTE,The one hundred and fifteen such Addresses which were actually
100,PREFATORY NOTE,"submitted are, with one or two exceptions, preserved in the Manuscript"
101,PREFATORY NOTE,Department of the British Museum.

964,"MOST THINKING PEOPLE,","into a frost-work of Brobdingnag filigree; but into a plain, honest,"

967,"MOST THINKING PEOPLE,",gave it you? Who helped you out of Lilliput? Who routed you from a
968,"MOST THINKING PEOPLE,","rat-hole, five inches by four, to perch you in a palace? Again and"
969,"MOST THINKING PEOPLE,","again I answer, _Mr. Whitbread_. You might have sweltered in that place"
970,"MOST THINKING PEOPLE,","with the Greek name[15] till doomsday, and neither _Lord Castlereagh_,"

981,"MOST THINKING PEOPLE,",who cries O. P. a man of letters too? You ran your O. P. against his

1530,BY W. S.[32],Look on my form in armour dight
1531,BY W. S.[32],Of steel inlaid with gold;
1532,BY W. S.[32],"My knees are stiff in iron buckles,"
1533,BY W. S.[32],Stiff spikes of steel protect my knuckles.
1534,BY W. S.[32],"These once belong'd to sable prince,"

1545,BY W. S.[32],
1546,BY W. S.[32],On fair Augusta's towers and trees
1547,BY W. S.[32],"Flitted the silent midnight breeze,"
1548,BY W. S.[32],"Curling the foliage as it past,"
1549,BY W. S.[32],Which from the moon-tipp'd plumage cast
1550,BY W. S.[32],"A spangled light, like dancing spray,"
1551,BY W. S.[32],Then re-assumed its still array;
1552,BY W. S.[32],"When, as night's lamp unclouded hung,"
1553,BY W. S.[32],"And down its full effulgence flung,"
1554,BY W. S.[32],It shed such soft and balmy power
1555,BY W. S.[32],"That cot and castle, hall and bower,"
1556,BY W. S.[32],"And spire and dome, and turret height,"
1557,BY W. S.[32],Appeared to slumber in the light.
1558,BY W. S.[32],"From Henry's chapel, Rufus' hall,"

1572,BY W. S.[32],The Burning.
1573,BY W. S.[32],
1574,BY W. S.[32],"As Chaos, which, by heavenly doom,"
1575,BY W. S.[32],"Had slept in everlasting gloom,"
1576,BY W. S.[32],Started with terror and surprise
1577,BY W. S.[32],When light first flash'd upon her eyes--
1578,BY W. S.[32],"So London's sons in nightcap woke,"
1579,BY W. S.[32],In bedgown woke her dames;
1580,BY W. S.[32],"For shouts were heard 'mid fire and smoke,"

1582,BY W. S.[32],'The playhouse is in flames!'
1583,BY W. S.[32],"And, lo! where Catherine Street extends,"
1584,BY W. S.[32],A fiery tail its lustre lends
1585,BY W. S.[32],To every window-pane;
1586,BY W. S.[32],"Blushes each spout in Martlet Court,"

1600,BY W. S.[32],"Across red Thames's gleaming tide,"

1602,BY W. S.[32],And daisy white and hoary thorn
1603,BY W. S.[32],In borrow'd lustre seem'd to sham

1605,BY W. S.[32],To those who on the hills around
1606,BY W. S.[32],"Beheld the flames from Drury's mound,"
1607,BY W. S.[32],"As from a lofty altar rise,"
1608,BY W. S.[32],It seem'd that nations did conspire
1609,BY W. S.[32],To offer to the god of fire
1610,BY W. S.[32],Some vast stupendous sacrifice!
1611,BY W. S.[32],"The summon'd firemen woke at call,"
1612,BY W. S.[32],And hied them to their stations all:
1613,BY W. S.[32],"Starting from short and broken snooze,"
1614,BY W. S.[32],"Each sought his pond'rous hobnail'd shoes,"
1615,BY W. S.[32],"But first his worsted hosen plied,"
1616,BY W. S.[32],"Plush breeches next, in crimson dyed,"
1617,BY W. S.[32],His nether bulk embraced;
1618,BY W. S.[32],"Then jacket thick, of red or blue,"
1619,BY W. S.[32],Whose massy shoulder gave to view
1620,BY W. S.[32],"The badge of each respective crew,"
1621,BY W. S.[32],In tin or copper traced.
1622,BY W. S.[32],"The engines thunder'd through the street,"
1623,BY W. S.[32],"Fire-hook, pipe, bucket, all complete,"
1624,BY W. S.[32],"And torches glared, and clattering feet"
1625,BY W. S.[32],Along the pavement paced.
1626,BY W. S.[32],"And one, the leader of the band,"
1627,BY W. S.[32],"From Charing Cross along the Strand,"
1628,BY W. S.[32],"Like stag by beagles hunted hard,"
1629,BY W. S.[32],Ran till he stopp'd at Vin'gar Yard.
1630,BY W. S.[32],"The burning badge his shoulder bore,"
1631,BY W. S.[32],"The belt and oil-skin hat he wore,"
1632,BY W. S.[32],"The cane he had, his men to bang,"
1633,BY W. S.[32],Show'd foreman of the British gang--
1634,BY W. S.[32],His name was Higginbottom. Now
1635,BY W. S.[32],'Tis meet that I should tell you how
1636,BY W. S.[32],The others came in view:
1637,BY W. S.[32],"The Hand-in-Hand the race begun,"
1638,BY W. S.[32],"Then came the Phœnix and the Sun,"
1639,BY W. S.[32],"Th' Exchange, where old insurers run,"
1640,BY W. S.[32],"The Eagle, where the new;"
1641,BY W. S.[32],"With these came Rumford, Bumford, Cole,"
1642,BY W. S.[32],"Robins from Hockley in the Hole,"
1643,BY W. S.[32],"Lawson and Dawson, cheek by jowl,"
1644,BY W. S.[32],Crump from St. Giles's Pound:
1645,BY W. S.[32],"Whitford and Mitford join'd the train,"
1646,BY W. S.[32],"Huggins and Muggins from Chick Lane,"
1647,BY W. S.[32],"And Clutterbuck, who got a sprain"
1648,BY W. S.[32],Before the plug was found.
1649,BY W. S.[32],"Hobson and Jobson did not sleep,"
1650,BY W. S.[32],"But ah! no trophy could they reap,"
1651,BY W. S.[32],For both were in the Donjon Keep
1652,BY W. S.[32],Of Bridewell's gloomy mound!
1653,BY W. S.[32],
1654,BY W. S.[32],"E'en Higginbottom now was posed,"
1655,BY W. S.[32],For sadder scene was ne'er disclosed;
1656,BY W. S.[32],"Without, within, in hideous show,"
1657,BY W. S.[32],"Devouring flames resistless glow,"
1658,BY W. S.[32],"And blazing rafters downward go,"
1659,BY W. S.[32],And never halloo 'Heads below!'
1660,BY W. S.[32],Nor notice give at all.
1661,BY W. S.[32],The firemen terrified are slow
1662,BY W. S.[32],"To bid the pumping torrent flow,"
1663,BY W. S.[32],For fear the roof should fall.
1664,BY W. S.[32],"Back, Robins, back! Crump, stand aloof!"
1665,BY W. S.[32],"Whitford, keep near the walls!"
1666,BY W. S.[32],"Huggins, regard your own behoof,"
1667,BY W. S.[32],"For, lo! the blazing rocking roof"
1668,BY W. S.[32],"Down, down, in thunder falls!"
1669,BY W. S.[32],"An awful pause succeeds the stroke,"
1670,BY W. S.[32],"And o'er the ruins volumed smoke,"
1671,BY W. S.[32],"Rolling around its pitchy shroud,"
1672,BY W. S.[32],Conceal'd them from th' astonish'd crowd.
1673,BY W. S.[32],"At length the mist awhile was clear'd,"
1674,BY W. S.[32],"When, lo! amid the wreck uprear'd,"
1675,BY W. S.[32],"Gradual a moving head appear'd,"
1676,BY W. S.[32],And Eagle firemen knew
1677,BY W. S.[32],"'Twas Joseph Muggins, name revered,"
1678,BY W. S.[32],The foreman of their crew.
1679,BY W. S.[32],"Loud shouted all in signs of woe,"
1680,BY W. S.[32],"'A Muggins! to the rescue, ho!'"
1681,BY W. S.[32],And pour'd the hissing tide:
1682,BY W. S.[32],"Meanwhile the Muggins fought amain,"
1683,BY W. S.[32],"And strove and struggled all in vain,"
1684,BY W. S.[32],"For, rallying but to fall again,"
1685,BY W. S.[32],"He totter'd, sunk, and died!"
1686,BY W. S.[32],
1687,BY W. S.[32],"Did none attempt, before he fell,"
1688,BY W. S.[32],To succour one they loved so well?
1689,BY W. S.[32],"Yes, Higginbottom did aspire"
1690,BY W. S.[32],"(His fireman's soul was all on fire),"
1691,BY W. S.[32],His brother chief to save;
1692,BY W. S.[32],But ah! his reckless generous ire
1693,BY W. S.[32],Served but to share his grave!
1694,BY W. S.[32],"Mid blazing beams and scalding streams,"
1695,BY W. S.[32],"Through fire and smoke he dauntless broke,"
1696,BY W. S.[32],Where Muggins broke before.
1697,BY W. S.[32],"But sulphury stench and boiling drench,"
1698,BY W. S.[32],"Destroying sight, o'erwhelm'd him quite,"
1699,BY W. S.[32],He sunk to rise no more.
1700,BY W. S.[32],"Still o'er his head, while Fate he braved,"
1701,BY W. S.[32],His whizzing water-pipe he waved;
1702,BY W. S.[32],"'Whitford and Mitford, ply your pumps,"
1703,BY W. S.[32],"You, Clutterbuck, come, stir your stumps"
1704,BY W. S.[32],Why are you in such doleful dumps?
1705,BY W. S.[32],"A fireman, and afraid of bumps!--"
1706,BY W. S.[32],What are they fear'd on? fools! 'od rot 'em!'
1707,BY W. S.[32],Were the last words of Higginbottom.

1714,BY W. S.[32],"Eat we and drink we, be our ditty,"
1715,BY W. S.[32],'Joy to the managing committee!'
1716,BY W. S.[32],"Eat we and drink we, join to rum"
1717,BY W. S.[32],Roast beef and pudding of the plum;
1718,BY W. S.[32],"Forth from thy nook, John Horner, come,"
1719,BY W. S.[32],"With bread of ginger brown thy thumb,"

1721,BY W. S.[32],"Roll, roll thy hoop, and twirl thy tops,"
1722,BY W. S.[32],"And buy, to glad thy smiling chops,"

1728,BY W. S.[32],Leap'd like a roebuck from the plain?
1729,BY W. S.[32],"Ropes rose and sunk, and rose again,"
1730,BY W. S.[32],And nimble workmen trod;
1731,BY W. S.[32],To realise bold Wyatt's plan
1732,BY W. S.[32],Rush'd many a howling Irishman;
1733,BY W. S.[32],"Loud clatter'd many a porter-can,"
1734,BY W. S.[32],"And many a raggamuffin clan,"
1735,BY W. S.[32],With trowel and with hod.

1748,BY W. S.[32],"And, but that solid bulk outspread"
1749,BY W. S.[32],"Opposed you on your onward tread,"
1750,BY W. S.[32],And posts and pillars warranted
1751,BY W. S.[32],"That all was true that Wyatt said,"
1752,BY W. S.[32],You might have deem'd her walls so thick

1833,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"decorated with frappant and tintinnabulant appendages, now serves"
1834,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"as the entrance of the lowly cottage, and now as the exit of a"

1847,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"'who live to please,' should not have their own pleasures entirely"
1848,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],overlooked. The children of Thespis are general in their censures

1850,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],distance from the oily irradiators which now dazzle the eyes of him
1851,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"who addresses you. I am, cries the Queen of Terrors, robbed of my"
1852,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],fair proportions. When the king-killing Thane hints to the breathless
1853,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"auditory the murders he means to perpetrate, in the castle of Macduff,"
1854,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"'ere his purpose cool,' so vast is the interval he has to travel"
1855,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"before he can escape from the stage, that his purpose has even time"
1856,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"to freeze. Your condition, cries the Muse of Smiles, is hard, but it"
1857,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],is cygnet's down in comparison with mine. The peerless peer of capers
1858,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"and congees[38] has laid it down as a rule, that the best good thing"
1859,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],uttered by the morning visitor should conduct him rapidly to the
1860,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"doorway, last impressions vying in durability with first. But when, on"
1861,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"this boarded elongation, it falls to my lot to say a good thing, to"
1862,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"ejaculate, 'keep moving,' or to chant, '_hic hoc horum genitivo_,' many"

1866,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"To objections like these, captiously urged and querulously maintained,"
1867,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],it is time that equity should conclusively reply. Deviation from
1868,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],scenic propriety has only to vituperate itself for the consequences
1869,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],it generates. Let the actor consider the line of exit as that line
1870,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],beyond which he should not soar in quest of spurious applause: let him
1871,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"reflect, that in proportion as he advances to the lamps, he recedes"
1872,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],from nature; that the truncheon of Hotspur acquires no additional
1873,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"charm from encountering the cheek of beauty in the stage-box, and that"
1874,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"the bravura of Mandane may produce effect, although the throat of her"
1875,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],who warbles it should not overhang the orchestra. The Jove of the
1876,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"modern critical Olympus, Lord Mayor of the theatric sky,[39] has, _ex"
1877,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"cathedrâ_, asserted, that a natural actor looks upon the audience part"
1878,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"of the theatre as the third side of the chamber he inhabits. Surely, of"
1879,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"the third wall thus fancifully erected, our actors should, by ridicule"
1880,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"or reason, be withheld from knocking their heads against the stucco."
1881,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],
1882,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"Time forcibly reminds me, that all things which have a limit must be"
1883,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"brought to a conclusion. Let me, ere that conclusion arrives, recall"
1884,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"to your recollection, that the pillars which rise on either side of"
1885,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"me, blooming in virid antiquity, like two massy evergreens, had yet"
1886,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"slumbered in their native quarry, but for the ardent exertions of"

1888,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],talents you are indebted for whatever pleasure this haunt of the muses
1889,JOHNSON'S GHOST.[37],"is calculated to afford. If, in defiance of chaotic malevolence,"

2179,HORACE.,"My pensive Public, wherefore look you sad?"
2180,HORACE.,"I had a grandmother, she kept a donkey"
2181,HORACE.,"To carry to the mart her crockery ware,"
2182,HORACE.,"And when that donkey look'd me in the face,"
2183,HORACE.,"His face was sad! and you are sad, my Public!"
2184,HORACE.,
2185,HORACE.,Joy should be yours: this tenth day of October
2186,HORACE.,Again assembles us in Drury Lane.
2187,HORACE.,Long wept my eye to see the timber planks
2188,HORACE.,"That hid our ruins; many a day I cried,"
2189,HORACE.,Ah me! I fear they never will rebuild it!
2190,HORACE.,"Till on one eve, one joyful Monday eve,"
2191,HORACE.,"As along Charles Street I prepared to walk,"
2192,HORACE.,"Just at the corner, by the pastrycook's,"
2193,HORACE.,I heard a trowel tick against a brick.
2194,HORACE.,"I look'd me up, and straight a parapet"
2195,HORACE.,Uprose at least seven inches o'er the planks.
2196,HORACE.,"Joy to thee, Drury! to myself I said:"
2197,HORACE.,"He[46] of Blackfriars' Road, who hymn'd thy downfall"
2198,HORACE.,"In loud Hosannahs, and who prophesied"
2199,HORACE.,"That flames, like those from prostrate Solyma,"
2200,HORACE.,"Would scorch the hand that ventured to rebuild thee,"
2201,HORACE.,"Has proved a lying prophet. From that hour,"
2202,HORACE.,"As leisure offer'd, close to Mr. Spring's"
2203,HORACE.,"Box-office door, I've stood and eyed the builders."
2204,HORACE.,They had a plan to render less their labours;
2205,HORACE.,Workmen in olden times would mount a ladder
2206,HORACE.,"With hooded heads, but these stretch'd forth a pole"
2207,HORACE.,"From the wall's pinnacle, they placed a pulley"
2208,HORACE.,"Athwart the pole, a rope athwart the pulley;"
2209,HORACE.,To this a basket dangled; mortar and bricks
2210,HORACE.,"Thus freighted, swung securely to the top,"
2211,HORACE.,And in the empty basket workmen twain
2212,HORACE.,"Precipitate, unhurt, accosted earth."
2213,HORACE.,
2214,HORACE.,"Oh! 'twas a goodly sound, to hear the people"
2215,HORACE.,"Who watch'd the work, express their various thoughts!"
2216,HORACE.,"While some believed it never would be finish'd,"
2217,HORACE.,"Some, on the contrary, believed it would."
2218,HORACE.,
2219,HORACE.,I've heard our front that faces Drury Lane
2220,HORACE.,"Much criticised; they say 'tis vulgar brick-work,"
2221,HORACE.,A mimic manufactory of floor-cloth.
2222,HORACE.,One of the morning papers wish'd that front
2223,HORACE.,Cemented like the front in Brydges Street;
2224,HORACE.,"As it now looks, they call it Wyatt's Mermaid,"
2225,HORACE.,A handsome woman with a fish's tail.
2226,HORACE.,
2227,HORACE.,White is the steeple of St. Bride's in Fleet Street:
2228,HORACE.,The Albion (as its name denotes) is white;
2229,HORACE.,Morgan and Saunders' shop for chairs and tables
2230,HORACE.,Gleams like a snow-ball in the setting sun;
2231,HORACE.,"White is Whitehall. But not St. Bride's in Fleet Street,"
2232,HORACE.,"The spotless Albion, Morgan, no, nor Saunders,"
2233,HORACE.,"Nor white Whitehall, is white as Drury's face."
2234,HORACE.,
2235,HORACE.,"Oh, Mr. Whitbread![47] fie upon you, sir!"
2236,HORACE.,I think you should have built a colonnade;
2237,HORACE.,"When tender Beauty, looking for her coach,"
2238,HORACE.,"Protrudes her gloveless hand, perceives the shower,"
2239,HORACE.,"And draws the tippet closer round her throat,"
2240,HORACE.,"Perchance her coach stands half a dozen off,"
2241,HORACE.,"And, ere she mounts the step, the oozing mud"
2242,HORACE.,"Soaks through her pale kid slipper. On the morrow,"
2243,HORACE.,"She coughs at breakfast, and her gruff papa"
2244,HORACE.,"Cries, 'There you go! this comes of playhouses!'"
2245,HORACE.,To build no portico is penny wise:
2246,HORACE.,Heaven grant it prove not in the end pound foolish!
2247,HORACE.,
2248,HORACE.,"Hail to thee, Drury! Queen of Theatres!"
2249,HORACE.,"What is the Regency in Tottenham Street,"
2250,HORACE.,"The Royal Amphitheatre of Arts,"
2251,HORACE.,"Astley's, Olympic, or the Sans Pareil,"
2252,HORACE.,Compar'd with thee? Yet when I view thee push'd
2253,HORACE.,"Back from the narrow street that christen'd thee,"
2254,HORACE.,I know not why they call thee Drury Lane.
2255,HORACE.,
2256,HORACE.,"Amid the freaks that modern fashion sanctions,"
2257,HORACE.,It grieves me much to see live animals
2258,HORACE.,"Brought on the stage. Grimaldi has his rabbit,"
2259,HORACE.,"Laurent his cat, and Bradbury his pig;"
2260,HORACE.,"Fie on such tricks! Johnson, the machinist"
2261,HORACE.,"Of former Drury, imitated life"
2262,HORACE.,"Quite to the life. The elephant in Blue Beard,"
2263,HORACE.,"Stuff'd by his hand, wound round his lithe proboscis,"
2264,HORACE.,As spruce as he who roar'd in Padmanaba.[48]
2265,HORACE.,Nought born on earth should die. On hackney stands
2266,HORACE.,"I reverence the coachman who cries 'Gee,'"
2267,HORACE.,And spares the lash. When I behold a spider
2268,HORACE.,"Prey on a fly, a magpie on a worm,"
2269,HORACE.,Or view a butcher with horn-handled knife
2270,HORACE.,"Slaughter a tender lamb as dead as mutton,"

2283,HORACE.,and misdirected genius whose name it has borrowed. We rather
2284,HORACE.,"think, however, that the tuneful brotherhood will consider it"

2664,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",under his auspices. The information they have received from undoubted
2665,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",authority--particularly from an old fruit-woman who has turned king's
2666,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","evidence, and whose name, for obvious reasons, we forbear to mention,"
2667,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",though we have had it some weeks in our possession--has induced them

2672,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","From the valuable and authentic source above alluded to, we have"

2681,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",and all of whom would have been hung from the chandeliers at that
2682,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","time, but for the mistaken lenity of government. At a given signal,"
2683,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","a well-known O. P. was to cry out from the gallery, 'Nosey! Music!'"
2684,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",whereupon all the O. P.'s were to produce from their inside-pockets

2691,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",never-sufficiently-enough-to-be-deeply-and-universally-to-be-venerated
2692,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","constitution, all the heads of the N. P.'s were to be thrown at the"
2693,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","fiddlers, to prevent their appearing in evidence, or perhaps as a false"
2694,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",and illiberal insinuation that they have no heads of their own. All
2695,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","that we know of the further designs of these incendiaries is, that they"

2698,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",The Manager has acted with his usual promptitude on this trying

2701,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","descendant of Guy Faux, assisted by Col. Congreve, has undertaken"
2702,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","to blow up the house, when necessary, in so novel and ingenious"
2703,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","a manner, that every O. P. shall be annihilated, while not a"
2704,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",whisker of the N. P.'s shall be singed. This strikingly displays
2705,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",the advantages of loyalty and attachment to government. Several

2707,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",not-a-bit-the-less-on-that-account-to-be-universally-execrated monster

2710,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",indication of misplaced applause or popular discontent (which
2711,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",accounts for the large space between the curtain and the lamps); and
2712,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",the public will participate our satisfaction in learning that the
2713,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","indecorous custom of standing up with the hat on is to be abolished, as"

2717,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","bawling 'Bill of the play!' are to be forthwith shot, for which purpose"
2718,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","soldiers will be stationed in the slips, and ball-cartridge is to be"
2719,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",served out with the lemonade. If any of the spectators happen to sneeze
2720,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","or spit, they are to be transported for life; and any person who is"
2721,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","so tall as to prevent another seeing, is to be dragged out and sent"

2728,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",adopted for preserving order and decorum within the walls of their
2729,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","magnificent edifice. Nor have they, while attentive to their own"
2730,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","concerns, by any means overlooked those of the cities of London"
2731,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","and Westminster. Finding, on enumeration, that they have with a"
2732,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","with-two-hands-and-one-tongue-to-be-applauded liberality, contracted"
2733,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","for more gunpowder than they want, they have parted with the surplus"
2734,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",to the mattock-carrying and hustings-hammering high bailiff of
2735,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","Westminster, who has, with his own shovel, dug a large hole in"

2737,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",upon the least symptom of ill-breeding in the mob at the general
2738,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","election, the whole of the market may be blown into the air. This,"
2739,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,","ladies and gentlemen, may at first make provisions _rise_, but"
2740,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,",we pledge the credit of our theatre that they will soon _fall_

2767,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,If the following poem should be fortunate enough to be selected for the
2768,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"opening address, a few words of explanation may be deemed necessary, on"
2769,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"my part, to avert invidious misrepresentation. The animadversion I have"
2770,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"thought it right to make on the noise created by tuning the orchestra,"
2771,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"will, I hope, give no lasting remorse to any of the gentlemen employed"
2772,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,in the band. It is to be desired that they would keep their instruments
2773,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"ready tuned, and strike off at once. This would be an accommodation"
2774,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"to many well-meaning persons who frequent the theatre, who, not being"
2775,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"blest with the ear of St. Cecilia, mistake the tuning for the overture,"
2776,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,and think the latter concluded before it is begun.

2779,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"Give, half-ashamed, a tiny flourish still,'"

2782,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"been informed, when this poem was upon the point of being sent off,"
2783,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"that there is but one hautboy in the band, I averted the storm of"
2784,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,popular and managerial indignation from the head of its blower: as it
2785,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"now stands, 'one fiddle' among many, the faulty individual will, I"
2786,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"hope, escape detection. The story of the flying play-bill is calculated"
2787,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"to expose a practice much too common, of pinning play-bills to the"
2788,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"cushions insecurely, and frequently, I fear, not pinning them at all."
2789,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"If these lines save one play-bill only from the fate I have recorded,"
2790,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,I shall not deem my labour ill employed. The concluding episode of
2791,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,Patrick Jennings glances at the boorish fashion of wearing the hat in
2792,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,the one-shilling gallery. Had Jennings thrust his between his feet
2793,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"at the commencement of the play, he might have leaned forward with"
2794,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"impunity, and the catastrophe I relate would not have occurred. The"
2795,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"line of handkerchiefs formed to enable him to recover his loss, is"
2796,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,purposely so crossed in texture and materials as to mislead the reader
2797,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"in respect to the real owner of any one of them. For, in the satirical"
2798,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"view of life and manners which I occasionally present, my clerical"
2799,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"profession has taught me how extremely improper it would be, by any"
2800,A PREFACE OF APOLOGIES.,"allusion, however slight, to give any uneasiness, however trivial, to"

3746,(WORDSWORTH),
3747,(WORDSWORTH),The impulses of air and sky

3756,(WORDSWORTH),"Fix'd are their feet in solid earth,"
3757,(WORDSWORTH),Where winds can never blow;

3770,(WORDSWORTH),"He loiters with the briar rose,--"
3771,(WORDSWORTH),"The blue bells are his play-fellows,"
3772,(WORDSWORTH),That dance upon their slender stem.
3773,(WORDSWORTH),
3774,(WORDSWORTH),"And I have said, my little Will,"
3775,(WORDSWORTH),Why should not he continue still
3776,(WORDSWORTH),A thing of Nature's rearing?
3777,(WORDSWORTH),A thing beyond the world's control--

4046,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Her much-loved _Smoke-Jack_ glimmers thro' the scene:
4047,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Mark how his various parts together tend,"
4048,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Point to one purpose,--in one object end:"
4049,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The spiral _grooves_ in smooth meanders flow,"
4050,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Drags the long _chain_, the polish'd axles glow,"
4051,(ERASMUS DARWIN),While slowly circumvolves the piece of beef below:
4052,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The conscious fire with bickering radiance burns,"
4053,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Eyes the rich joint, and roasts it as it turns."
4054,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4055,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"So youthful HORNER rolled the roguish eye,"
4056,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Cull'd the dark plum from out his Christmas pie,"
4057,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And cried in self-applause--'How good a boy am I.'
4058,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4059,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"So, the sad victim of domestic spite,"
4060,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Fair CINDERELLA, pass'd the wintry night,"
4061,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"In the lone chimney's darksome nook immured,"
4062,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Her form disfigured, and her charms obscured."
4063,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Sudden her godmother appears in sight,"
4064,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Lifts the charm'd rod, and chants the mystic rite."
4065,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The chanted rite the maid attentive hears,"
4066,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And feels new ear-rings deck her listening ears;
4067,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"While 'midst her towering tresses, aptly set,"
4068,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Shines bright, with quivering glance, the smart aigrette;"
4069,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Brocaded silks the splendid dress complete,"
4070,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And the Glass Slipper grasps her fairy feet.
4071,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Six cock-tail'd mice transport her to the ball,"
4072,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And liveried lizards wait upon her call.
4073,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4074,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Alas! that partial Science should approve
4075,(ERASMUS DARWIN),The sly RECTANGLE'S[69] too licentious love!
4076,(ERASMUS DARWIN),For _three_ bright nymphs the wily wizard burns;--
4077,(ERASMUS DARWIN),_Three_ bright-ey'd nymphs requite his flame by turns.
4078,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Strange force of magic skill! combined of yore
4079,(ERASMUS DARWIN),With PLATO'S science and MENECMUS' lore.
4080,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"In _Afric's_ schools, amid those sultry sands"
4081,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"High on its base where POMPEY'S pillar stands,"
4082,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"This learnt THE SEER; and learnt, alas! too well,"
4083,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Each scribbled talisman and smoky spell:
4084,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"What mutter'd charms, what soul-subduing arts,"
4085,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Fell ZATANAI[70] to his sons imparts.
4086,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4087,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Gins![71]--black and huge! who in DOM-DANIEL'S[72] cave
4088,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Writhe your scorch'd limbs on sulphur's azure wave,"
4089,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Or, shivering, yell amidst eternal snows,"
4090,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Where cloud-capp'd CAF[73] protrudes his granite toes
4091,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"(Bound by _his_ will, _Judæa's_ fabled king,[74]"
4092,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Lord of _Aladdin's_ lamp and mystic ring).
4093,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Gins! YE remember! for YOUR toil convey'd
4094,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Whate'er of drugs the powerful charm could aid;
4095,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Air, earth, and sea ye search'd, and where below"
4096,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Flame embryo lavas, young volcanoes glow--"
4097,(ERASMUS DARWIN),GINS! ye beheld appall'd th' enchanter's hand
4098,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Wave in dark air th' _Hypothenusal_ wand:
4099,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Saw him the mystic _Circle_ trace, and wheel"
4100,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"With head erect, and far-extended heel;"
4101,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Saw him, with speed that mock'd the dazzled eye,"
4102,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Self-whirl'd, in quick gyrations eddying fly:"
4103,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Till done the potent spell--behold him grown
4104,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Fair _Venus'_ emblem--the _Phœnician Cone_.[75]
4105,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4106,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Triumphs THE SEER, and now secure observes"
4107,(ERASMUS DARWIN),The kindling passions of the _rival_ CURVES.
4108,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4109,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"And first, the fair PARABOLA behold,"
4110,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Her timid arms, with virgin blush, unfold!"
4111,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Though, on one _focus_ fix'd, her eyes betray"
4112,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"A heart that glows with love's resistless sway,"
4113,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Though, climbing oft, she strive with bolder grace"
4114,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Round his tall neck to clasp her fond embrace,"
4115,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Still ere she reach it, from his polish'd side"
4116,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Her trembling hands in devious _Tangents_ glide.
4117,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4118,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Not thus HYPERBOLA:--with subtlest art
4119,(ERASMUS DARWIN),The blue-eyed wanton plays her changeful part;
4120,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Quick as her _conjugated axes_ move
4121,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Through every posture of luxurious love,"
4122,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Her sportive limbs with easiest grace expand;
4123,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Her charms unveil'd provoke the lover's hand:
4124,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Unveil'd, except in many a filmy ray,"
4125,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Where light _Asymptotes_ o'er her bosom play,"
4126,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Nor touch her glowing skin, nor intercept the day."
4127,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4128,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Yet why, ELLIPSIS, at thy fate repine?"
4129,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"More lasting bliss, securer joys are thine."
4130,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Though to each Fair his treach'rous wish may stray,"
4131,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Though each, in turn, may seize a transient sway,"
4132,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"'Tis thine with mild coercion to restrain,"
4133,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Twine round his struggling heart, and bind with endless chain."
4134,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4135,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Thus, happy FRANCE! in thy regenerate land,"
4136,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Where TASTE with RAPINE saunters hand in hand;
4137,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Where, nursed in seats of innocence and bliss,"
4138,(ERASMUS DARWIN),REFORM greets TERROR with fraternal kiss;
4139,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Where mild PHILOSOPHY first taught to scan
4140,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The _wrongs_ of Providence, and _rights_ of MAN:"
4141,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Where MEMORY broods o'er FREEDOM'S earlier scene,"
4142,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The _Lantern_ bright, and brighter _Guillotine_;"
4143,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"_Three_ gentle swains evolve their longing arms,"
4144,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And woo the young REPUBLIC'S virgin charms;
4145,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"And though proud BARRAS with the Fair succeed,"
4146,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Though not in vain th' Attorney REWBELL plead,"
4147,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Oft doth th' impartial nymph their love forgo,"
4148,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"To clasp thy crooked shoulders, blest LEPEAUX!"
4149,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4150,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"So, with dark dirge athwart the blasted heath,"
4151,(ERASMUS DARWIN),_Three_ SISTER WITCHES hail'd th' appall'd Macbeth.
4152,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4153,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"So, the _Three_ FATES beneath grim _Pluto's_ roof,"
4154,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Strain the dun warp, and weave the murky woof;"
4155,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Till deadly ATROPOS with fatal shears
4156,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Slits the thin promise of th' expected years,"
4157,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"While midst the dungeon's gloom or battle's din,"
4158,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Ambition's victims perish, as they spin."
4159,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4160,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Thus, the _Three_ GRACES on the _Idalian_ green"
4161,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Bow with deft homage to _Cythera's_ Queen;
4162,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Her polish'd arms with pearly bracelets deck,"
4163,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Part her light locks, and bare her ivory neck;"
4164,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Round her fair form ethereal odours throw,"
4165,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And teach th' unconscious zephyrs where to blow;
4166,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Floats the thin gauze, and glittering as they play,"
4167,(ERASMUS DARWIN),The bright folds flutter in phlogistic day.
4168,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4169,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"So, with his daughters _Three_, th' unsceptred LEAR"
4170,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Heaved the loud sigh, and pour'd the glistering tear;"
4171,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"His DAUGHTERS _Three_, save one alone, conspire"
4172,(ERASMUS DARWIN),(Rich in _his_ gifts) to spurn their generous sire;
4173,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Bid the rude storm his hoary tresses drench,"
4174,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Stint the spare meal, the hundred knights retrench;"
4175,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Mock his mad sorrow, and with alter'd mien"
4176,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Renounce the daughter, and assert the queen."
4177,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"A father's griefs his feeble frame convulse,"
4178,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Rack his white head, and fire his feverous pulse;"
4179,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Till kind CORDELIA soothes his soul to rest,"
4180,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And folds the parent-monarch to her breast.
4181,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4182,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Thus some fair spinster grieves in wild affright,"
4183,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Vex'd with dull megrim, or vertigo light;"
4184,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Pleas'd round the fair _Three_ dawdling doctors stand,"
4185,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Wave the white wig, and stretch the asking hand,"
4186,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"State the grave doubt, the nauseous draught decree,"
4187,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"And all receive, tho' none deserve, a fee."
4188,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4189,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"So down thy hill, romantic Ashbourn, glides"
4190,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The DERBY _dilly_, carrying _Three_ INSIDES."
4191,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"One in each corner sits, and lolls at ease,"
4192,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"With folded arms, propt back, and outstretch'd knees;"
4193,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"While the press'd _Bodkin_, punch'd and squeez'd to death,"
4194,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Sweats in the mid-most place, and pants for breath."
4195,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4196,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"'Twas thine alone, O youth of giant frame,"
4197,(ERASMUS DARWIN),ISOSCELES! that rebel heart to tame!
4198,(ERASMUS DARWIN),In vain coy MATHESIS[76] thy presence flies:
4199,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Still turn her fond hallucinating eyes;
4200,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Thrills with _Galvanic_ fires each tortuous nerve,"
4201,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Throb her blue veins, and dies her cold reserve."
4202,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"--Yet strives the Fair, till in the giant's breast"
4203,(ERASMUS DARWIN),She sees the mutual passion flame confessed:
4204,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Where'er he moves, she sees his tall limbs trace"
4205,(ERASMUS DARWIN),_Internal Angles equal at the base_;
4206,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Again she doubts him: but _produced at will_,"
4207,(ERASMUS DARWIN),She sees _th' external Angles equal still_.
4208,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4209,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Say, blest Isosceles! what favouring power,"
4210,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Or love, or chance, at night's auspicious hour,"
4211,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"While to the _Asses'-Bridge_ entranced you stray'd,"
4212,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Led to the _Asses'-Bridge_ th' enamour'd maid?--
4213,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The _Asses'-Bridge_, for ages doom'd to hear"
4214,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The deafening surge assault his wooden ear,"
4215,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"With joy repeats sweet sounds of mutual bliss,"
4216,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The soft susurrant sigh, and gently-murmuring kiss."
4217,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4218,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"So thy dark arches, LONDON _Bridge_, bestride"
4219,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Indignant THAMES, and part his angry tide,"
4220,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"There oft--returning from those green retreats,"
4221,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Where fair _Vauxhallia_ decks her sylvan seats;--
4222,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Where each spruce nymph, from city compters free,"
4223,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Sips the froth'd syllabub, or fragrant tea;"
4224,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"While with sliced ham, scraped beef, and burnt champagne,"
4225,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Her 'prentice lover soothes his amorous pain;
4226,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"There oft, in well-trimm'd wherry, glide along"
4227,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Smart beaux and giggling belles, a glittering throng:"
4228,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Smells the tarr'd rope--with undulation fine
4229,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Flaps the loose sail--the silken awnings shine;
4230,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4231,(ERASMUS DARWIN),'Shoot we the bridge!' the venturous boatmen cry;
4232,(ERASMUS DARWIN),'Shoot we the bridge!' th' exulting fare reply.
4233,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"--Down the steep fall the headlong waters go,"
4234,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Curls the white foam, the breakers roar below."
4235,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The veering helm the dextrous steersman stops,"
4236,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Shifts the thin oar, the fluttering canvas drops;"
4237,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Then with closed eyes, clench'd hands, and quick-drawn breath,"
4238,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Darts at the central arch, nor heeds the gulf beneath."
4239,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"--Full 'gainst the pier the unsteady timbers knock,"
4240,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The loose planks, starting, own the impetuous shock;"
4241,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The shifted oar, dropp'd sail, and steadied helm,"
4242,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"With angry surge the closing waters whelm,"
4243,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"--Laughs the glad THAMES, and clasps each fair one's charms,"
4244,(ERASMUS DARWIN),That screams and scrambles in his oozy arms.
4245,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"--Drench'd each smart garb, and clogg'd each struggling limb,"
4246,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Far o'er the stream the Cockneys sink or swim;
4247,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"While each badged boatman, clinging to his oar,"
4248,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Bounds o'er the buoyant wave, and climbs the applauding shore."
4249,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4250,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"So, towering ALP! from thy majestic ridge"
4251,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Young FREEDOM gazed on LODI'S blood-stain'd _Bridge_;
4252,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Saw, in thick throngs, conflicting armies rush,"
4253,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Ranks close on ranks, and squadrons squadrons crush;"
4254,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Burst in bright radiance through the battle's storm,"
4255,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Waved her broad hands, display'd her awful form;"
4256,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Bade at her feet regenerate nations bow,"
4257,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And twin'd the wreath round Buonaparte's brow.
4258,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"--Quick with new lights, fresh hopes, and alter'd zeal,"
4259,(ERASMUS DARWIN),The slaves of despots dropp'd the blunted steel:
4260,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Exulting Victory crown'd her favourite child,"
4261,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"And freed LIGURIA, clapp'd her hands, and smiled."
4262,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4263,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Nor long the time ere Britain's shores shall greet
4264,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"The warrior-sage, with gratulation sweet:"
4265,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Eager to grasp the wreath of naval fame,"
4266,(ERASMUS DARWIN),The GREAT REPUBLIC plans the _Floating Frame_!
4267,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"--O'er the huge frame gigantic TERROR stalks,"
4268,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And counts with joy the close-compacted balks:
4269,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Of young-eyed MASSACRES the Cherub crew
4270,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Round their grim chief the mimic task pursue;
4271,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Turn the stiff screw,[77] apply the strengthening clamp,"
4272,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Drive the long bolt, or fix the stubborn cramp,"
4273,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Lash the reluctant beam, the cable splice,"
4274,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Join the firm dove-tail with adjustment nice,"
4275,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Thro' yawning fissures urge the willing wedge,"
4276,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Or give the smoothing adze a sharper edge.
4277,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"--Or group'd in fairy bands, with playful care,"
4278,(ERASMUS DARWIN),The unconscious bullet to the furnace bear;--
4279,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Or gaily tittering, tip the match with fire,"
4280,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Prime the big mortar, bid the shell aspire;"
4281,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Applaud, with tiny hands, and laughing eyes,"
4282,(ERASMUS DARWIN),And watch the bright destruction as it flies.
4283,(ERASMUS DARWIN),
4284,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Now the fierce forges gleam with angry glare--
4285,(ERASMUS DARWIN),The windmill[78] waves his woven wings in air;
4286,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Swells the proud sail, the exulting streamers fly,"
4287,(ERASMUS DARWIN),Their nimble fins unnumber'd paddles ply:
4288,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"--Ye soft airs breathe, ye gentle billows waft,"
4289,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"And, fraught with Freedom, bear the expected RAFT!"
4290,(ERASMUS DARWIN),"Perch'd on her back, behold the Patriot train,"
4291,"MUIR, ASHLEY, BARLOW, BUONAPARTE, PAINE!","MUIR, ASHLEY, BARLOW, BUONAPARTE, PAINE!"
4292,"MUIR, ASHLEY, BARLOW, BUONAPARTE, PAINE!",While ROWAN'S hand directs the blood-empurpled rein.

4302,"MUIR, ASHLEY, BARLOW, BUONAPARTE, PAINE!",Fair _Freedom's Plant_ o'ershades the laughing isle:

4311,"MUIR, ASHLEY, BARLOW, BUONAPARTE, PAINE!","Close the nice slider, ope the expectant sack;"
4312,"MUIR, ASHLEY, BARLOW, BUONAPARTE, PAINE!","Then twitch, with fairy hands, the frolic pin--"
4313,"MUIR, ASHLEY, BARLOW, BUONAPARTE, PAINE!",Down falls the impatient axe with deafening din;

4336,(GERMAN TRAGEDY),
4337,(GERMAN TRAGEDY),"Sweet 'kerchief, check'd with heavenly blue,"
4338,(GERMAN TRAGEDY),"Which once my love sat knotting in,"
4339,(GERMAN TRAGEDY),"Alas, Matilda _then_ was true,"
4340,(GERMAN TRAGEDY),At least I thought so at the U-

4349,(GERMAN TRAGEDY),Ye bore Matilda from my view;

4394,(SCOTT),"The lad that has worrying tikes enow,"

4398,(SCOTT),Woe's my heart for Wat o' the Cleuch!
4399,(SCOTT),
4400,(SCOTT),Wat o' the Cleuch sat down to dine
4401,(SCOTT),With two pint stoups of good red wine;
4402,(SCOTT),But when he look'd they both were dry;
4403,(SCOTT),O poverty parts good company!
4404,(SCOTT),Wat o' the Cleuch! Wat o' the Cleuch!
4405,(SCOTT),O for a drink to Wat o' the Cleuch!
4406,(SCOTT),
4407,(SCOTT),Wat o' the Cleuch came down the Tine
4408,(SCOTT),To woo a maid both gallant and fine;
4409,(SCOTT),But as he came o'er by Dick o' the Side
4410,(SCOTT),He smell'd the mutton and left the bride.
4411,(SCOTT),Wat o' the Cleuch! Wat o' the Cleuch!
4412,(SCOTT),What think ye now of Wat o' the Cleuch?
4413,(SCOTT),
4414,(SCOTT),"Wat o' the Cleuch came here to steal,"
4415,(SCOTT),He wanted milk and he wanted veal;
4416,(SCOTT),But ere he wan o'er the Beetleston brow
4417,(SCOTT),He hough'd the calf and eated the cow!
4418,(SCOTT),Wat o' the Cleuch! Wat o' the Cleuch!
4419,(SCOTT),"Well done, doughty Wat o' the Cleuch!"
4420,(SCOTT),
4421,(SCOTT),"Wat o' the Cleuch came here to fight,"

4424,(SCOTT),But changed his cheer at the back of the fell.
4425,(SCOTT),Wat o' the Cleuch! Wat o' the Cleuch!
4426,(SCOTT),O for a croudy to Wat o' the Cleuch!
4427,(SCOTT),
4428,(SCOTT),"Wat o' the Cleuch kneel'd down to pray,"
4429,(SCOTT),He wist not what to do or to say;
4430,(SCOTT),"But he pray'd for beef, and he pray'd for bree,"
4431,(SCOTT),A two-hand spoon and a haggis to pree.
4432,(SCOTT),Wat o' the Cleuch! Wat o' the Cleuch!
4433,(SCOTT),That's the cheer for Wat o' the Cleuch!
4434,(SCOTT),
4435,(SCOTT),"But the devil is cunning as I heard say,"

4467,(WORDSWORTH),This short inscription--'Here lies buried
4468,(WORDSWORTH),"The Flying Tailor, aged twenty-nine!'"
4469,(WORDSWORTH),
4470,(WORDSWORTH),"Him from his birth unto his death I knew,"
4471,(WORDSWORTH),And many years before he had attain'd
4472,(WORDSWORTH),"The fulness of his fame, I prophesied"
4473,(WORDSWORTH),"The triumphs of that youth's agility,"
4474,(WORDSWORTH),And crown'd him with that name which afterwards
4475,(WORDSWORTH),He nobly justified--and dying left
4476,(WORDSWORTH),To fame's eternal blazon--read it here--
4477,(WORDSWORTH),'The Flying Tailor!'
4478,(WORDSWORTH),
4479,(WORDSWORTH),It is somewhat strange
4480,(WORDSWORTH),"That his mother was a cripple, and his father"
4481,(WORDSWORTH),Long way declined into the vale of years
4482,(WORDSWORTH),When their son Hugh was born. At first the babe
4483,(WORDSWORTH),"Was sickly, and a smile was seen to pass"
4484,(WORDSWORTH),"Across the midwife's cheek, when, holding up"
4485,(WORDSWORTH),"The sickly wretch, she to the father said,"
4486,(WORDSWORTH),'A fine man-child!' What else could they expect?
4487,(WORDSWORTH),"The mother being, as I said before,"
4488,(WORDSWORTH),"A cripple, and the father of the child"
4489,(WORDSWORTH),Long way declined into the vale of years.
4490,(WORDSWORTH),
4491,(WORDSWORTH),But mark the wondrous change--ere he was put
4492,(WORDSWORTH),"By his mother into breeches, Nature strung"
4493,(WORDSWORTH),The muscular part of his economy
4494,(WORDSWORTH),"To an unusual strength, and he could leap,"
4495,(WORDSWORTH),"All unimpeded by his petticoats,"
4496,(WORDSWORTH),Over the stool on which his mother sat
4497,(WORDSWORTH),"When carding wool, or cleansing vegetables,"
4498,(WORDSWORTH),Or meek performing other household tasks.
4499,(WORDSWORTH),"Cunning he watch'd his opportunity,"
4500,(WORDSWORTH),"And oft, as house-affairs did call her thence,"
4501,(WORDSWORTH),"Overleapt Hugh, a perfect whirligig,"
4502,(WORDSWORTH),More than six inches o'er th' astonish'd stool.
4503,(WORDSWORTH),"What boots it to narrate, how at leap-frog"
4504,(WORDSWORTH),Over the breech'd and unbreech'd villagers
4505,(WORDSWORTH),He shone conspicuous? Leap-frog do I say?
4506,(WORDSWORTH),Vainly so named. What though in attitude
4507,(WORDSWORTH),The Flying Tailor aped the croaking race
4508,(WORDSWORTH),"When issuing from the weed-entangled pool,"
4509,(WORDSWORTH),"Tadpoles no more, they seek the new-mown fields,"
4510,(WORDSWORTH),"A jocund people, bouncing to and fro"
4511,(WORDSWORTH),Amid the odorous clover--while amazed
4512,(WORDSWORTH),The grasshopper sits idle on the stalk
4513,(WORDSWORTH),With folded pinions and forgets to sing.
4514,(WORDSWORTH),"Frog-like, no doubt, in attitude he was;"
4515,(WORDSWORTH),But sure his bounds across the village green
4516,(WORDSWORTH),Seem'd to my soul--(my soul for ever bright
4517,(WORDSWORTH),With purest beams of sacred poesy)--
4518,(WORDSWORTH),"Like bounds of red-deer on the Highland hill,"
4519,(WORDSWORTH),"When, close-environed by the tinchels chain,"
4520,(WORDSWORTH),"He lifts his branchy forehead to the sky,"
4521,(WORDSWORTH),Then o'er the many-headed multitude
4522,(WORDSWORTH),"Springs belling half in terror, half in rage,"
4523,(WORDSWORTH),And fleeter than the sunbeam or the wind
4524,(WORDSWORTH),Speeds to his cloud-lair on the mountain-top.
4525,(WORDSWORTH),
4526,(WORDSWORTH),"No more of this--suffice it to narrate,"
4527,(WORDSWORTH),In his tenth year he was apprenticed
4528,(WORDSWORTH),Unto a Master Tailor by a strong
4529,(WORDSWORTH),"And regular indenture of seven years,"
4530,(WORDSWORTH),"Commencing from the date the parchment bore,"
4531,(WORDSWORTH),"And ending on a certain day, that made"
4532,(WORDSWORTH),The term complete of seven solar years.
4533,(WORDSWORTH),"Oft have I heard him say, that at this time"
4534,(WORDSWORTH),"Of life he was most wretched; for, constrain'd"
4535,(WORDSWORTH),"To sit all day cross-legg'd upon a board,"
4536,(WORDSWORTH),The natural circulation of the blood
4537,(WORDSWORTH),"Thereby was oft impeded, and he felt"
4538,(WORDSWORTH),"So numb'd at times, that when he strove to rise"
4539,(WORDSWORTH),"Up from his work he could not, but fell back"
4540,(WORDSWORTH),Among the shreds and patches that bestrew'd
4541,(WORDSWORTH),"With various colours, brightening gorgeously,"
4542,(WORDSWORTH),The board all round him--patch of warlike red
4543,(WORDSWORTH),With which he patched the regimental-suits
4544,(WORDSWORTH),"Of a recruiting military troop,"
4545,(WORDSWORTH),At that time stationed in a market town
4546,(WORDSWORTH),At no great distance--eke of solemn black
4547,(WORDSWORTH),"Shreds of no little magnitude, with which"
4548,(WORDSWORTH),"The parson's Sunday-coat was then repairing,"
4549,(WORDSWORTH),That in the new-roof'd church he might appear
4550,(WORDSWORTH),With fitting dignity--and gravely fill
4551,(WORDSWORTH),"The sacred seat of pulpit eloquence,"
4552,(WORDSWORTH),Cheering with doctrinal point and words of faith
4553,(WORDSWORTH),"The poor man's heart, and from the shallow wit"
4554,(WORDSWORTH),"Of atheist drying up each argument,"
4555,(WORDSWORTH),Or sharpening his own weapons only to turn
4556,(WORDSWORTH),"Their point against himself, and overthrow"
4557,(WORDSWORTH),His idols with the very enginery
4558,(WORDSWORTH),Reared 'gainst the structure of our English Church.
4559,(WORDSWORTH),
4560,(WORDSWORTH),"Oft too, when striving all he could to finish"
4561,(WORDSWORTH),"The stated daily task, the needle's point,"
4562,(WORDSWORTH),"Slanting insidious from th' eluded stitch,"
4563,(WORDSWORTH),"Hath pinched his finger, by the thimble's mail"
4564,(WORDSWORTH),"In vain defended, and the crimson blood"
4565,(WORDSWORTH),Distain'd the lining of some wedding-suit;
4566,(WORDSWORTH),"A dismal omen! that to mind like his,"
4567,(WORDSWORTH),Apt to perceive in slightest circumstance
4568,(WORDSWORTH),"Mysterious meaning, yielded sore distress"
4569,(WORDSWORTH),"And feverish perturbation, so that oft"
4570,(WORDSWORTH),"He scarce could eat his dinner--nay, one night"
4571,(WORDSWORTH),"He swore to run from his apprenticeship,"
4572,(WORDSWORTH),"And go on board a first-rate man-of-war,"
4573,(WORDSWORTH),"From Plymouth lately come to Liverpool,"
4574,(WORDSWORTH),"Where, in the stir and tumult of a crew"
4575,(WORDSWORTH),"Composed of many nations, 'mid the roar"
4576,(WORDSWORTH),"Of wave and tempest, and the deadlier voice"
4577,(WORDSWORTH),"Of battle, he might strive to mitigate"
4578,(WORDSWORTH),The fever that consumed his mighty heart.
4579,(WORDSWORTH),
4580,(WORDSWORTH),But other doom was his. That very night
4581,(WORDSWORTH),"A troop of tumblers came into the village,"
4582,(WORDSWORTH),"Tumbler, equestrian, mountebank,--on wire,"
4583,(WORDSWORTH),"On rope, on horse, with cup and balls, intent"
4584,(WORDSWORTH),"To please the gaping multitude, and win"
4585,(WORDSWORTH),The coin from labour's pocket--small perhaps
4586,(WORDSWORTH),"Each separate piece of money, but when join'd"
4587,(WORDSWORTH),"Making a good round sum, destined ere long"
4588,(WORDSWORTH),"All to be melted, (so these lawless folk"
4589,(WORDSWORTH),Name spending coin in loose debauchery)
4590,(WORDSWORTH),"Melted into ale--or haply stouter cheer,"
4591,(WORDSWORTH),"Gin diuretic, or the liquid flame"
4592,(WORDSWORTH),"Of baneful brandy, by the smuggler brought"
4593,(WORDSWORTH),"From the French coast in shallop many-oar'd,"
4594,(WORDSWORTH),"Skulking by night round headland and through bay,"
4595,(WORDSWORTH),"Afraid of the King's cutter, or the barge"
4596,(WORDSWORTH),"Of cruising frigate, arm'd with chosen men,"
4597,(WORDSWORTH),And with her sweeps across the foamy waves
4598,(WORDSWORTH),Moving most beautiful with measured strokes.
4599,(WORDSWORTH),
4600,(WORDSWORTH),It chanced that as he threw a somerset
4601,(WORDSWORTH),Over three horses (each of larger size
4602,(WORDSWORTH),Than our small mountain-breed) one of the troop
4603,(WORDSWORTH),"Put out his shoulder, and was otherwise"
4604,(WORDSWORTH),"Considerably bruised, especially"
4605,(WORDSWORTH),About the loins and back. So he became
4606,(WORDSWORTH),"Useless unto that wandering company,"
4607,(WORDSWORTH),And likely to be felt a sore expense
4608,(WORDSWORTH),"To men just on the eve of bankruptcy,"
4609,(WORDSWORTH),So the master of the troop determined
4610,(WORDSWORTH),"To leave him in the workhouse, and proclaim'd"
4611,(WORDSWORTH),That if there was a man among the crowd
4612,(WORDSWORTH),"Willing to fill his place and able too,"
4613,(WORDSWORTH),Now was the time to show himself. Hugh Thwaites
4614,(WORDSWORTH),"Heard the proposal, as he stood apart"
4615,(WORDSWORTH),Striving with his own soul--and with a bound
4616,(WORDSWORTH),"He leapt into the circle, and agreed"
4617,(WORDSWORTH),To supply the place of him who had been hurt.
4618,(WORDSWORTH),A shout of admiration and surprise
4619,(WORDSWORTH),"Then tore heaven's concave, and completely fill'd"
4620,(WORDSWORTH),"The little field, where near a hundred people"
4621,(WORDSWORTH),Were standing in a circle round and fair.
4622,(WORDSWORTH),"Oft have I striven by meditative power,"
4623,(WORDSWORTH),And reason working 'mid the various forms
4624,(WORDSWORTH),"Of various occupations and professions,"
4625,(WORDSWORTH),"To explain the cause of one phenomenon,"
4626,(WORDSWORTH),"That, since the birth of science, hath remain'd"
4627,(WORDSWORTH),"A bare enunciation, unexplain'd"
4628,(WORDSWORTH),"By any theory, or mental light"
4629,(WORDSWORTH),"Stream'd on it by the imaginative will,"
4630,(WORDSWORTH),"Or spirit musing in the cloudy shrine,"
4631,(WORDSWORTH),The Penetralia of the immortal soul.
4632,(WORDSWORTH),"I now allude to that most curious fact,"
4633,(WORDSWORTH),"That 'mid a given number, say threescore,"
4634,(WORDSWORTH),"Of tailors, more men of agility"
4635,(WORDSWORTH),"Will issue out, than from an equal show"
4636,(WORDSWORTH),From any other occupation--say
4637,(WORDSWORTH),"Smiths, barbers, bakers, butchers, or the like."
4638,(WORDSWORTH),"Let me not seem presumptuous, if I strive"
4639,(WORDSWORTH),"This subject to illustrate; nor, while I give"
4640,(WORDSWORTH),"My meditations to the world, will I"
4641,(WORDSWORTH),"Conceal from it, that much I have to say"
4642,(WORDSWORTH),I learnt from one who knows the subject well
4643,(WORDSWORTH),In theory and practice--need I name him?
4644,(WORDSWORTH),"The light-heel'd author of the Isle of Palms,"
4645,(WORDSWORTH),Illustrious more for leaping than for song.
4646,(WORDSWORTH),
4647,(WORDSWORTH),"First, then, I would lay down this principle,"
4648,(WORDSWORTH),That all excessive action by the law
4649,(WORDSWORTH),"Of nature tends unto repose. This granted,"
4650,(WORDSWORTH),All action not excessive must partake
4651,(WORDSWORTH),The nature of excessive action--so
4652,(WORDSWORTH),"That in all human beings who keep moving,"
4653,(WORDSWORTH),Unconscious cultivation of repose
4654,(WORDSWORTH),Is going on in silence. Be it so.
4655,(WORDSWORTH),Apply to men of sedentary lives
4656,(WORDSWORTH),"This leading principle, and we behold"
4657,(WORDSWORTH),"That, active in their inactivity,"
4658,(WORDSWORTH),"And unreposing in their long repose,"
4659,(WORDSWORTH),"They are, in fact, the sole depositaries"
4660,(WORDSWORTH),"Of all the energies by others wasted,"
4661,(WORDSWORTH),And come at last to teem with impulses
4662,(WORDSWORTH),"Of muscular motion, not to be withstood,"
4663,(WORDSWORTH),And either giving vent unto themselves
4664,(WORDSWORTH),"In numerous feats of wild agility,"
4665,(WORDSWORTH),Or terminating in despair and death.
4666,(WORDSWORTH),
4667,(WORDSWORTH),"Now, of all sedentary lives, none seems"
4668,(WORDSWORTH),So much so as the tailor's.--Weavers use
4669,(WORDSWORTH),"Both arms and legs, and, we may safely add,"
4670,(WORDSWORTH),"Their bodies too, for arms and legs can't move"
4671,(WORDSWORTH),Without the body--as the waving branch
4672,(WORDSWORTH),Of the green oak disturbs his glossy trunk.
4673,(WORDSWORTH),"Not so the Tailor--for he sits cross-legg'd,"
4674,(WORDSWORTH),"Cross-legg'd for ever! save at time of meals,"
4675,(WORDSWORTH),"In bed, or when he takes his little walk"
4676,(WORDSWORTH),"From shop to ale-house, picking, as he goes,"
4677,(WORDSWORTH),"Stray patch of fustian, cloth, or cassimere,"
4678,(WORDSWORTH),"Which, as by natural instinct, he discerns,"
4679,(WORDSWORTH),"Though soil'd with mud, and by the passing wheel"
4680,(WORDSWORTH),Bruised to attenuation 'gainst the stones.
4681,(WORDSWORTH),
4682,(WORDSWORTH),"Here then we pause--and need no farther go,"
4683,(WORDSWORTH),We have reach'd the sea-mark of our utmost sail.
4684,(WORDSWORTH),Now let me trace the effect upon his mind
4685,(WORDSWORTH),"Of this despised profession. Deem not thou,"
4686,(WORDSWORTH),"O rashly deem not, that his boyish days"
4687,(WORDSWORTH),"Past at the shop-board, when the stripling bore"
4688,(WORDSWORTH),With bashful feeling of apprenticeship
4689,(WORDSWORTH),"The name of Tailor, deem not that his soul"
4690,(WORDSWORTH),"Derived no genial influence from a life,"
4691,(WORDSWORTH),"Which, although haply adverse in the main"
4692,(WORDSWORTH),"To the growth of intellect, and the excursive power,"
4693,(WORDSWORTH),Yet in its ordinary forms possessed
4694,(WORDSWORTH),"A constant influence o'er his passing thoughts,"
4695,(WORDSWORTH),"Moulded his appetences and his will,"
4696,(WORDSWORTH),"And wrought out, by the work of sympathy,"
4697,(WORDSWORTH),"Between his bodily and mental form,"
4698,(WORDSWORTH),"Rare correspondence, wond'rous unity!"
4699,(WORDSWORTH),Perfect--complete--and fading not away.
4700,(WORDSWORTH),"While on his board cross-legg'd he used to sit,"
4701,(WORDSWORTH),"Shaping of various garments, to his mind"
4702,(WORDSWORTH),An image rose of every character
4703,(WORDSWORTH),"For whom each special article was framed,"
4704,(WORDSWORTH),"Coat, waistcoat, breeches. So at last his soul"
4705,(WORDSWORTH),"Was like a storehouse, filled with images,"
4706,(WORDSWORTH),By musing hours of solitude supplied.
4707,(WORDSWORTH),Nor did his ready fingers shape the cut
4708,(WORDSWORTH),Of villager's uncouth habiliments
4709,(WORDSWORTH),"With greater readiness, than did his mind"
4710,(WORDSWORTH),Frame corresponding images of those
4711,(WORDSWORTH),Whose corporal measurement the neat-mark'd paper
4712,(WORDSWORTH),In many a mystic notch for ay retain'd.
4713,(WORDSWORTH),"Hence, more than any man I ever knew,"
4714,(WORDSWORTH),Did he possess the power intuitive
4715,(WORDSWORTH),Of diving into character. A pair
4716,(WORDSWORTH),Of breeches to his philosophic eye
4717,(WORDSWORTH),"Were not what unto other folks they seem,"
4718,(WORDSWORTH),"Mere simple breeches, but in them he saw"
4719,(WORDSWORTH),"The symbol of the soul--mysterious, high"
4720,(WORDSWORTH),Hieroglyphics! such as Egypt's Priest
4721,(WORDSWORTH),"Adored upon the holy Pyramid,"
4722,(WORDSWORTH),"Vainly imagined tomb of monarchs old,"
4723,(WORDSWORTH),"But raised by wise philosophy, that sought"
4724,(WORDSWORTH),"By darkness to illumine, and to spread"
4725,(WORDSWORTH),Knowledge by dim concealment--process high
4726,(WORDSWORTH),"Of man's imaginative, deathless soul."
4727,(WORDSWORTH),"Nor, haply, in th' abasement of the life"
4728,(WORDSWORTH),"Which stern necessity had made his own,"
4729,(WORDSWORTH),Did he not recognise a genial power
4730,(WORDSWORTH),Of soul-ennobling fortitude. He heard
4731,(WORDSWORTH),"Unmoved the witling's shallow contumely,"
4732,(WORDSWORTH),"And thus, in spite of nature, by degrees"
4733,(WORDSWORTH),He saw a beauty and a majesty
4734,(WORDSWORTH),"In this despised trade, which warrior's brow"
4735,(WORDSWORTH),Hath rarely circled--so that when he sat
4736,(WORDSWORTH),"Beneath his sky-light window, he hath cast"
4737,(WORDSWORTH),"A gaze of triumph on the godlike sun,"
4738,(WORDSWORTH),"And felt that orb, in all his annual round,"
4739,(WORDSWORTH),Beheld no happier nobler character
4740,(WORDSWORTH),"Than him, Hugh Thwaites, a little tailor-boy."
4741,(WORDSWORTH),
4742,(WORDSWORTH),"Thus I, with no unprofitable song,"
4743,(WORDSWORTH),"Have, in the silence of th' umbrageous wood,"
4744,(WORDSWORTH),Chaunted the heroic youthful attributes
4745,(WORDSWORTH),Of him the Flying Tailor. Much remains
4746,(WORDSWORTH),"Of highest argument, to lute or lyre"
4747,(WORDSWORTH),Fit to be murmur'd with impassion'd voice;
4748,(WORDSWORTH),"And when, by timely supper and by sleep"
4749,(WORDSWORTH),"Refresh'd, I turn me to the welcome task,"
4750,(WORDSWORTH),"With lofty hopes,--Reader, do thou expect"
4751,(WORDSWORTH),The final termination of my lay.
4752,(WORDSWORTH),"For, mark my words,--eternally my name"
4753,(WORDSWORTH),"Shall last on earth, conspicuous like a star"

4791,(COLERIDGE),A little after the break of day.
4792,(COLERIDGE),Its raiment was the thousand dyes
4793,(COLERIDGE),Of flowers in the heavenly paradise;
4794,(COLERIDGE),"Its track a beam of the sun refined,"

4801,(COLERIDGE),"Then I bethought me of the place,"
4802,(COLERIDGE),To lodge the messenger of grace;
4803,(COLERIDGE),"And I chose the ancient sycamore,"

4811,(COLERIDGE),What shall form this dome of joy?
4812,(COLERIDGE),The leaf of the rose would be too rude
4813,(COLERIDGE),For a thing that is not flesh and blood;
4814,(COLERIDGE),"The walls must be of the sunny air,"
4815,(COLERIDGE),"And the roof the silvery gossamer,"
4816,(COLERIDGE),"And all the ceiling, round and round,"
4817,(COLERIDGE),"Wove half of light, and half of sound;"
4818,(COLERIDGE),The sounds must be the tones that fly
4819,(COLERIDGE),"From distant harp, just ere they die;"
4820,(COLERIDGE),"And the light the moon's soft midnight ray,"
4821,(COLERIDGE),"When the cloud is downy, and thin, and grey."

4863,(COLERIDGE),Sit in the damp and dewy dell
4864,(COLERIDGE),"Counting the racks of drizzly rain,"
4865,(COLERIDGE),And how often the Rail cries over again?
4866,(COLERIDGE),"For she's harping, harping in the brake,"
4867,(COLERIDGE),"Craik, craik--Craik, craik."
4868,(COLERIDGE),"Ten times nine, and thrice eleven;--"
4869,(COLERIDGE),That last call was an hundred and seven.
4870,(COLERIDGE),"Craik, craik--the hour is near--"

4876,(COLERIDGE),"The stream sounds harsh, but not loud."
4877,(COLERIDGE),"There is a cloud that seems to hover,"

4879,(COLERIDGE),What is it like?--'Tis like a whale;
4880,(COLERIDGE),"'Tis like a shark with half the tail,"
4881,(COLERIDGE),"Not half, but third and more;"
4882,(COLERIDGE),"Now 'tis a wolf, and now a boar;"
4883,(COLERIDGE),Its face is raised--it cometh here;
4884,(COLERIDGE),Let it come--there is no fear.
4885,(COLERIDGE),"There's two for heaven, and ten for hell,"
4886,(COLERIDGE),Let it come--'tis well--'tis well!
4887,(COLERIDGE),Said the Lady Isabelle.

4889,(COLERIDGE),"What ails that little cut-tail'd whelp,"
4890,(COLERIDGE),"That it continues to yelp, yelp?"
4891,(COLERIDGE),"Yelp, yelp, and it turns its eye"
4892,(COLERIDGE),"Up to the tree and half to the sky,"
4893,(COLERIDGE),"Half to the sky and full to the cloud,"
4894,(COLERIDGE),And still it whines and barks aloud.
4895,(COLERIDGE),Why I should dread I cannot tell;
4896,(COLERIDGE),There is a spirit; I know it well!
4897,(COLERIDGE),I see it in yon falling beam--
4898,(COLERIDGE),"Is it a vision, or a dream?"
4899,(COLERIDGE),"It is no dream, full well I know,"
4900,(COLERIDGE),I have a woful deed to do!
4901,(COLERIDGE),"Hush, hush, thou little murmurer;"
4902,(COLERIDGE),I tell thee hush--the dead are near!
4903,(COLERIDGE),
4904,(COLERIDGE),"If thou knew'st all, poor tailless whelp,"
4905,(COLERIDGE),"Well might'st thou tremble, growl, and yelp;"
4906,(COLERIDGE),"But thou know'st nothing, hast no part,"
4907,(COLERIDGE),(Simple and stupid as thou art)
4908,(COLERIDGE),Save gratitude and truth of heart.
4909,(COLERIDGE),But they are coming by this way
4910,(COLERIDGE),That have been dead for a year and a day;
4911,(COLERIDGE),"Without challenge, without change,"
4912,(COLERIDGE),They shall have their full revenge!
4913,(COLERIDGE),They have been sent to wander in woe
4914,(COLERIDGE),"In the lands of flame, and the lands of snow;"
4915,(COLERIDGE),But those that are dead
4916,(COLERIDGE),"Shall the green sward tread,"
4917,(COLERIDGE),And those that are living
4918,(COLERIDGE),Shall soon be dead!
4919,(COLERIDGE),"None to pity them, none to help!"
4920,(COLERIDGE),"Thou may'st quake, my cut-tail'd whelp!"
4921,(COLERIDGE),
4922,(COLERIDGE),There are two from the grave
4923,(COLERIDGE),That I fain would save;
4924,(COLERIDGE),Full hard is the weird
4925,(COLERIDGE),For the young and the brave!
4926,(COLERIDGE),"Perchance they are rapt in vision sweet,"
4927,(COLERIDGE),While the passing breezes kiss their feet;
4928,(COLERIDGE),And they are dreaming of joy and love!--
4929,(COLERIDGE),"Well, let them go--there's room above."
4930,(COLERIDGE),
4931,(COLERIDGE),"There are three times three, and three to these,"
4932,(COLERIDGE),"Count as you will, by twos or threes!"
4933,(COLERIDGE),"Three for the gallows, and three for the wave,"
4934,(COLERIDGE),"Three to roast behind the stone,"
4935,(COLERIDGE),And three that shall never see the grave
4936,(COLERIDGE),Until the day and the hour are gone!
4937,(COLERIDGE),For retribution is mine alone!
4938,(COLERIDGE),"The cloud is redder in its hue,"
4939,(COLERIDGE),"The hour is near, and vengeance due;"

4941,(COLERIDGE),'Tis but a step to Borrowdale!
4942,(COLERIDGE),"Why shouldst thou love and follow me,"
4943,(COLERIDGE),Poor faithful thing? I pity thee!
4944,(COLERIDGE),
4945,(COLERIDGE),"Up rose the Lady Isabelle,"
4946,(COLERIDGE),"I may not of her motion tell,"
4947,(COLERIDGE),Yet thou may'st look upon her frame;
4948,(COLERIDGE),"Look on it with a passing eye,"
4949,(COLERIDGE),"But think not thou upon the same,"
4950,(COLERIDGE),"Turn away, and ask not why;"
4951,(COLERIDGE),"For if thou darest look again,"
4952,(COLERIDGE),"Mad of heart and seared of brain,"
4953,(COLERIDGE),Thou shalt never look again!
4954,(COLERIDGE),
4955,(COLERIDGE),What can ail that short-tail'd whelp?
4956,(COLERIDGE),"'Tis either behind or far before,"
4957,(COLERIDGE),And it hath changed its whining yelp
4958,(COLERIDGE),To a shorten'd yuff--its little core
4959,(COLERIDGE),"Seems bursting with terror and dismay,"
4960,(COLERIDGE),"Yuff, yuff,--hear how it speeds away."
4961,(COLERIDGE),"Hold thy peace, thou yemering thing,"

4969,(COLERIDGE),"All is beauty, and all is grace!"
4970,(COLERIDGE),The earth and air are tinged with blue;
4971,(COLERIDGE),There are no footsteps in the dew;

4973,(COLERIDGE),Such stillness on the face of heaven?
4974,(COLERIDGE),"The fleecy clouds that sleep above,"
4975,(COLERIDGE),"Are like the wing of beauteous dove,"

6409,(COLERIDGE),
6410,(COLERIDGE),"Far, far at sea, were the wise men three,"
6411,(COLERIDGE),When their fishing-net they threw;
6412,(COLERIDGE),"And at the throw, the moon below"
6413,(COLERIDGE),In a thousand fragments flew.
6414,(COLERIDGE),
6415,(COLERIDGE),The sea was bright with the dancing light
6416,(COLERIDGE),"Of a million million gleams,"
6417,(COLERIDGE),Which the broken moon shot forth as soon
6418,(COLERIDGE),As the net disturbed her beams.
6419,(COLERIDGE),
6420,(COLERIDGE),"They drew in their net: it was empty and wet,"
6421,(COLERIDGE),"And they had lost their pain,"
6422,(COLERIDGE),"Soon ceased the play of each dancing ray,"
6423,(COLERIDGE),And the image was round again.
6424,(COLERIDGE),
6425,(COLERIDGE),"Three times they threw, three times they drew,"
6426,(COLERIDGE),And all the while were mute;
6427,(COLERIDGE),"And evermore their wonder grew,"
6428,(COLERIDGE),Till they could not but dispute.
6429,(COLERIDGE),
6430,(COLERIDGE),"Their silence they broke, and each one spoke"
6431,(COLERIDGE),"Full long, and loud, and clear;"
6432,(COLERIDGE),A man at sea their voices three
6433,(COLERIDGE),Full three leagues off might hear.
6434,(COLERIDGE),
6435,(COLERIDGE),The three wise men got home again
6436,(COLERIDGE),To their children and their wives:
6437,(COLERIDGE),"But touching their trip, and their net's vain dip,"
6438,(COLERIDGE),They disputed all their lives.
6439,(COLERIDGE),
6440,(COLERIDGE),"The wise men three could never agree,"
6441,(COLERIDGE),Why they missed the promised boon;
6442,(COLERIDGE),"They agreed alone that their net they had thrown,"
6443,(COLERIDGE),And they had not caught the moon.
6444,(COLERIDGE),
6445,(COLERIDGE),"I have thought myself pale o'er this ancient tale,"
6446,(COLERIDGE),And its sense I could not ken;
6447,(COLERIDGE),But now I see that the wise men three
6448,(COLERIDGE),Were paper-money men.
6449,(COLERIDGE),
6450,(COLERIDGE),"'Rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub,'"
6451,(COLERIDGE),"Is a mystic burthen old,"
6452,(COLERIDGE),"Which I've pondered about till my fire went out,"
6453,(COLERIDGE),And I could not sleep for cold.
6454,(COLERIDGE),
6455,(COLERIDGE),"I now divine each mystic sign,"
6456,(COLERIDGE),"Which robbed me oft of sleep,"
6457,(COLERIDGE),"Three men in a bowl, who went to troll,"
6458,(COLERIDGE),For the moon in the midnight deep.
6459,(COLERIDGE),
6460,(COLERIDGE),Three men were they who science drank
6461,(COLERIDGE),From Scottish fountains free;
6462,(COLERIDGE),"Tho cash they sank in the Gotham bank,"
6463,(COLERIDGE),Was the moon beneath the sea.
6464,(COLERIDGE),
6465,(COLERIDGE),"The breaking of the imaged moon,"
6466,(COLERIDGE),"At the fishing-net's first splash,"
6467,(COLERIDGE),Was the breaking of the bank as soon
6468,(COLERIDGE),As the wise men claimed their cash.
6469,(COLERIDGE),
6470,(COLERIDGE),"The dispute which lasted all their lives,"
6471,(COLERIDGE),"Was the economic strife,"
6472,(COLERIDGE),Which the son's son's son of every one
6473,(COLERIDGE),Will maintain through all his life.
6474,(COLERIDGE),
6475,(COLERIDGE),"The son's son's sons will baffled be,"
6476,(COLERIDGE),As were their sires of old;
6477,(COLERIDGE),"But they only agree, like the wise men three,"
6478,(COLERIDGE),That they could not get their gold.
6479,(COLERIDGE),
6480,(COLERIDGE),"And they'll build systems dark and deep,"
6481,(COLERIDGE),And systems broad and high;
6482,(COLERIDGE),But two of three will never agree
6483,(COLERIDGE),About the reason why.
6484,(COLERIDGE),
6485,(COLERIDGE),And he who at this day will seek
6486,(COLERIDGE),"The Economic Club,"
6487,(COLERIDGE),"Will find at least three sages there,"
6488,(COLERIDGE),As ready as any that ever were
6489,(COLERIDGE),To go to sea in a tub.

7786,II.,Men oftentimes prepare a lot
7787,II.,"Which ere it finds them, is not what"
7788,II.,Suits with their genuine station.
7789,II.,
7790,II.,
7791,III.,III.
7792,III.,
7793,III.,All things that Peter saw and felt
7794,III.,Had a peculiar aspect to him;
7795,III.,And when they came within the belt
7796,III.,"Of his own nature, seemed to melt,"
7797,III.,"Like cloud to cloud, into him."
7798,III.,
7799,III.,
7800,IV.,IV.
7801,IV.,
7802,IV.,And so the outward world uniting
7803,IV.,"To that within him, he became"
7804,IV.,Considerably uninviting
7805,IV.,"To those who, meditation slighting,"
7806,IV.,Were moulded in a different frame.
7807,IV.,
7808,IV.,
7809,V.,V.
7810,V.,
7811,V.,"And he scorned them, and they scorned him;"
7812,V.,And he scorned all they did; and they
7813,V.,Did all that men of their own trim
7814,V.,"Are wont to do to please their whim,"
7815,V.,"Drinking, lying, swearing, play."
7816,V.,
7817,V.,
7818,VI.,VI.
7819,VI.,
7820,VI.,Such were his fellow-servants; thus
7821,VI.,"His virtue, like our own, was built"
7822,VI.,Too much on that indignant fuss
7823,VI.,Hypocrite Pride stirs up in us
7824,VI.,To bully one another's guilt.
7825,VI.,
7826,VI.,
7827,VII.,VII.
7828,VII.,
7829,VII.,He had a mind which was somehow
7830,VII.,At once circumference and centre
7831,VII.,Of all he might or feel or know;
7832,VII.,"Nothing went ever out, although"
7833,VII.,Something did ever enter.
7834,VII.,
7835,VII.,
7836,VIII.,VIII.
7837,VIII.,
7838,VIII.,He had as much imagination
7839,VIII.,As a pint-pot;--he never could
7840,VIII.,"Fancy another situation,"
7841,VIII.,"From which to dart his contemplation,"
7842,VIII.,Than that wherein he stood.
7843,VIII.,
7844,VIII.,
7845,IX.,IX.
7846,IX.,
7847,IX.,"Yet his was individual mind,"
7848,IX.,And new created all he saw
7849,IX.,"In a new manner, and refined"
7850,IX.,"Those new creations, and combined"
7851,IX.,"Them, by a master-spirit's law."
7852,IX.,
7853,IX.,
7854,X.,X.
7855,X.,
7856,X.,Thus--though unimaginative--
7857,X.,"An apprehension clear, intense,"
7858,X.,"Of his mind's work, had made alive"
7859,X.,The things it wrought on; I believe
7860,X.,Wakening a sort of thought in sense.
7861,X.,
7862,X.,
7863,XI.,XI.
7864,XI.,
7865,XI.,But from the first 'twas Peter's drift
7866,XI.,"To be a kind of moral eunuch,"
7867,XI.,"He touched the hem of Nature's shift,"
7868,XI.,Felt faint--and never dared uplift
7869,XI.,"The closest, all-concealing tunic."
7870,XI.,
7871,XI.,
7872,XII.,XII.
7873,XII.,
7874,XII.,"She laughed the while, with an arch smile,"
7875,XII.,And kissed him with a sister's kiss.
7876,XII.,"And said--'My best Diogenes,"
7877,XII.,"I love you well--but, if you please,"
7878,XII.,Tempt not again my deepest bliss.

7880,XII.,
7881,XIII.,XIII.
7882,XIII.,
7883,XIII.,"''Tis you are cold--for I, not coy,"
7884,XIII.,"Yield love for love, frank, warm, and true;"
7885,XIII.,"And Burns, a Scottish peasant boy--"
7886,XIII.,His errors prove it--knew my joy
7887,XIII.,"More, learnèd friend, than you."
7888,XIII.,
7889,XIII.,
7890,XIV.,XIV.
7891,XIV.,
7892,XIV.,"'_Bocca bacciata non perde ventura,"
7893,XIV.,Anzi rinnuova come fa la luna_:--
7894,XIV.,"So thought Boccaccio, whose sweet words might cure a"
7895,XIV.,"Male prude, like you, from what you now endure, a"
7896,XIV.,"Low-tide in soul, like a stagnant laguna.'"
7897,XIV.,
7898,XIV.,
7899,XV.,XV.
7900,XV.,
7901,XV.,"Then Peter rubbed his eyes severe,"
7902,XV.,And smoothed his spacious forehead down
7903,XV.,"With his broad palm;--'twixt love and fear,"
7904,XV.,"He looked, as he no doubt felt, queer,"
7905,XV.,And in his dream sate down.
7906,XV.,
7907,XV.,
7908,XVI.,XVI.
7909,XVI.,
7910,XVI.,The Devil was no uncommon creature;
7911,XVI.,A leaden-witted thief--just huddled
7912,XVI.,Out of the dross and scum of nature;
7913,XVI.,"A toad-like lump of limb and feature,"
7914,XVI.,"With mind, and heart, and fancy muddled."
7915,XVI.,
7916,XVI.,
7917,XVII.,XVII.
7918,XVII.,
7919,XVII.,"He was that heavy, dull, cold thing,"
7920,XVII.,The spirit of evil well may be:
7921,XVII.,A drone too base to have a sting;
7922,XVII.,"Who gluts, and grimes his lazy wing,"
7923,XVII.,"And calls lust, luxury."
7924,XVII.,
7925,XVII.,
7926,XVIII.,XVIII.
7927,XVIII.,
7928,XVIII.,Now he was quite the kind of wight
7929,XVIII.,"Round whom collect, at a fixed aera,"
7930,XVIII.,"Venison, turtle, hock, and claret,--"
7931,XVIII.,"Good cheer,--and those who come to share it--"
7932,XVIII.,And best East Indian madeira!
7933,XVIII.,
7934,XVIII.,
7935,XIX.,XIX.
7936,XIX.,
7937,XIX.,It was his fancy to invite
7938,XIX.,"Men of science, wit, and learning,"
7939,XIX.,Who came to lend each other light;
7940,XIX.,He proudly thought that his gold's might
7941,XIX.,Had set those spirits burning.

7943,XIX.,
7944,XX.,XX.
7945,XX.,

7950,XX.,Exposed to the wide sky.
7951,XX.,

7954,XXI.,
7955,XXI.,"And all the while, with loose fat smile,"
7956,XXI.,"The willing wretch sat winking there,"
7957,XXI.,Believing 'twas his power that made
7958,XXI.,That jovial scene--and that all paid
7959,XXI.,Homage to his unnoticed chair.

7961,XXI.,
7962,XXII.,XXII.
7963,XXII.,
7964,XXII.,Though to be sure this place was Hell;

7982,I.,
7983,I.,
7984,II.,II.
7985,II.,
7986,II.,He was a mighty poet--and
7987,II.,A subtle-souled psychologist;
7988,II.,"All things he seemed to understand,"
7989,II.,Of old or new--of sea or land--
7990,II.,But his own mind--which was a mist.

8000,III.,
8001,III.,
8002,IV.,IV.
8003,IV.,
8004,IV.,"He spoke of poetry, and how"
8005,IV.,'Divine it was--a light--a love--
8006,IV.,A spirit which like wind doth blow
8007,IV.,"As it listeth, to and fro;"

8019,V.,
8020,VI.,VI.
8021,VI.,
8022,VI.,"Now Peter, when he heard such talk,"

8024,VI.,"Stand like a man asleep, or balk"
8025,VI.,"Some wishing guest of knife or fork,"
8026,VI.,Or drop and break his master's plate.
8027,VI.,
8028,VI.,
8029,VII.,VII.
8030,VII.,
8031,VII.,At night he oft would start and wake
8032,VII.,"Like a lover, and began"
8033,VII.,In a wild measure songs to make
8034,VII.,"On moor, and glen, and rocky lake,"
8035,VII.,And on the heart of man--

8045,VIII.,
8046,VIII.,
8047,IX.,IX.
8048,IX.,
8049,IX.,For in his thought he visited
8050,IX.,"The spots in which, ere dead and damned,"
8051,IX.,He his wayward life had led;
8052,IX.,Yet knew not whence the thoughts were fed
8053,IX.,Which thus his fancy crammed.

8055,IX.,
8056,X.,X.

8058,X.,And these obscure remembrances
8059,X.,"Stirred such harmony in Peter,"

8063,X.,
8064,X.,

8066,XI.,
8067,XI.,For though it was without a sense

8072,XI.,
8073,XI.,
8074,XII.,XII.
8075,XII.,
8076,XII.,He had also dim recollections

8092,XIV.,XIV.
8093,XIV.,
8094,XIV.,"Like gentle rains, on the dry plains,"

8351,XXV.,
8352,XXV.,His morals thus were undermined:--

8360,XXVI.,
8361,XXVI.,In the death hues of agony
8362,XXVI.,"Lambently flashing from a fish,"
8363,XXVI.,Now Peter felt amused to see
8364,XXVI.,"Shades like a rainbow's rise and flee,"
8365,XXVI.,Mixed with a certain hungry wish.[88]
8366,XXVI.,
8367,XXVI.,
8368,XXVII.,XXVII.
8369,XXVII.,
8370,XXVII.,So in his Country's dying face

8372,XXVII.,"Seeking in vain his last embrace,"
8373,XXVII.,"Wailing her own abandoned case,"
8374,XXVII.,With hardened sneer he turned away:
8375,XXVII.,
8376,XXVII.,
8377,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
8378,XXVIII.,
8379,XXVIII.,And coolly to his own soul said;--
8380,XXVIII.,'Do you not think that we might make
8381,XXVIII.,A poem on her when she's dead:--

8406,XXXI.,"As troubled skies stain waters clear,"

8410,XXXI.,Shaking dim grave-clothes in the wind.

8447,XXXV.,
8448,XXXV.,

10615,(BULWER LYTTON),"Another board of oysters, ladye mine!"
10616,(BULWER LYTTON),To-night Lucullus with himself shall sup.
10617,(BULWER LYTTON),These mute inglorious Miltons are divine!
10618,(BULWER LYTTON),"And as I here in slipper'd ease recline,"
10619,(BULWER LYTTON),"Quaffing of Perkins's Entire my fill,"
10620,(BULWER LYTTON),I sigh not for the lymph of Aganippe's rill.
10621,(BULWER LYTTON),
10622,(BULWER LYTTON),"A nobler inspiration fires my brain,"
10623,(BULWER LYTTON),Caught from Old England's fine time-hallow'd drink;

10627,(BULWER LYTTON),This makes strong hearts--strong heads attest its charm--
10628,(BULWER LYTTON),This nerves the might that sleeps in Britain's brawny arm!
10629,(BULWER LYTTON),
10630,(BULWER LYTTON),But these remarks are neither here nor there.
10631,(BULWER LYTTON),"Where was I? Oh, I see--old Southey's dead!"
10632,(BULWER LYTTON),"They'll want some bard to fill the vacant chair,"
10633,(BULWER LYTTON),"And drain the annual butt--and oh, what head"

10642,(BULWER LYTTON),"That marks the poet in his waking dreams,"
10643,(BULWER LYTTON),"When, as his fancies cluster thick and thicker,"
10644,(BULWER LYTTON),He feels the trance divine of poesy and liquor.
10645,(BULWER LYTTON),
10646,(BULWER LYTTON),"They throng around me now, those things of air,"
10647,(BULWER LYTTON),That from my fancy took their being's stamp:

10664,(BULWER LYTTON),"Until the public, 'wildered as they read,"
10665,(BULWER LYTTON),Believed they saw that which was not in sight--
10666,(BULWER LYTTON),Of course 'twas not for me to set them right;
10667,(BULWER LYTTON),"For in my nether heart convinced I am,"
10668,(BULWER LYTTON),Philosophy's as good as any other bam.
10669,(BULWER LYTTON),
10670,(BULWER LYTTON),Novels three-volumed I shall write no more--
10671,(BULWER LYTTON),Somehow or other now they will not sell;

10673,(BULWER LYTTON),I find the Magazines pay quite as well.

11068,(TENNYSON),Whom Trinity most loves of living sons.

11070,(TENNYSON),Deeming such honour only due to those
11071,(TENNYSON),Upon whose greatness Death had set his seal.

11080,(TENNYSON),Whereat full shrilly sang th' excluded bard:

11737,(WHITTIER),Jest look here! these peltries give
11738,(WHITTIER),"Cash, wherefrom a pair may live."
11739,(WHITTIER),
11740,(WHITTIER),"'I, you think, am but a vagrant,"
11741,(WHITTIER),Trapping beasts by no means fragrant:
11742,(WHITTIER),Yet--I'm sure it's worth a thank--
11743,(WHITTIER),I've a handsome sum in bank.'
11744,(WHITTIER),
11745,(WHITTIER),Turned and vanished Hiram Hover;
11746,(WHITTIER),"And, before the year was over,"
11747,(WHITTIER),"Huldah, with the yarbs she sold,"
11748,(WHITTIER),"Bought a cape, against the cold."
11749,(WHITTIER),
11750,(WHITTIER),Black and thick the furry cape was;
11751,(WHITTIER),"Of a stylish cut the shape was,"
11752,(WHITTIER),"And the girls, in all the town,"
11753,(WHITTIER),Envied Huldah up and down.
11754,(WHITTIER),
11755,(WHITTIER),"Then, at last, one winter morning,"
11756,(WHITTIER),"Hiram came, without a warning:"
11757,(WHITTIER),"'Either,' said he, 'you are blind,"
11758,(WHITTIER),"Huldah, or you've changed your mind."
11759,(WHITTIER),
11760,(WHITTIER),"'Me you snub for trapping varmints,"
11761,(WHITTIER),Yet you take the skins for garments:
11762,(WHITTIER),"Since you wear the skunk and mink,"
11763,(WHITTIER),"There's no harm in me, I think.'"
11764,(WHITTIER),
11765,(WHITTIER),"'Well,' she said, 'we will not quarrel,"
11766,(WHITTIER),"Hiram: I accept the moral,"
11767,(WHITTIER),"Now the fashion's so, I guess"
11768,(WHITTIER),I can't hardly do no less.'
11769,(WHITTIER),
11770,(WHITTIER),Thus the trouble all was over
11771,(WHITTIER),Of the love of Hiram Hover;
11772,(WHITTIER),Thus he made sweet Huldah Hyde
11773,(WHITTIER),Huldah Hover as his bride.
11774,(WHITTIER),
11775,(WHITTIER),"Love employs, with equal favour,"
11776,(WHITTIER),Things of good and evil savour;
11777,(WHITTIER),"That, which first appeared to part,"
11778,(WHITTIER),"Warmed, at last, the maiden's heart."

12141,(BYRON),But I have a dislike to quoting wrong:
12142,(BYRON),"I was unlucky--sinned against, not sinning--"
12143,(BYRON),When Cowper wrote down 'middle' for 'beginning.'
12144,(BYRON),
12145,(BYRON),So to proceed. That abstinence from Malt
12146,(BYRON),Has always struck me as extremely curious.
12147,(BYRON),"The Greek mind must have had some vital fault,"
12148,(BYRON),That they should stick to liquors so injurious--
12149,(BYRON),"(Wine, water, tempered p'raps with Attic salt)--"
12150,(BYRON),"And not at once invent that mild, luxurious,"
12151,(BYRON),"And artful beverage, Beer. How the digestion"
12152,(BYRON),"Got on without it, is a startling question."
12153,(BYRON),
12154,(BYRON),Had they digestions? and an actual body
12155,(BYRON),Such as dyspepsia might make attacks on?
12156,(BYRON),Were they abstract ideas--(like Tom Noddy
12157,(BYRON),"And Mr. Briggs)--or men, like Jones and Jackson?"
12158,(BYRON),"Then Nectar--was that beer, or whisky-toddy?"
12159,(BYRON),"Some say the Gaelic mixture, _I_ the Saxon:"
12160,(BYRON),I think a strict adherence to the latter
12161,(BYRON),"Might make some Scots less pigheaded, and fatter."
12162,(BYRON),
12163,(BYRON),"Besides, Bon Gaultier definitely shows"
12164,(BYRON),That the real beverage for feasting gods on
12165,(BYRON),"Is a soft compound, grateful to the nose"
12166,(BYRON),"And also to the palate, known as 'Hodgson.'"

12168,(BYRON),"To be a peer: and this I would lay odds on,"
12169,(BYRON),"(Though in his Memoirs it may not appear,)"
12170,(BYRON),That that man owed his rise to copious Beer.
12171,(BYRON),

12175,(BYRON),"And still your merits be unrecked, unsung?"

12190,(BYRON),Oh! when the green slopes of Arcadia burned
12191,(BYRON),"With all the lustre of the dying day,"
12192,(BYRON),"And on Cithaeron's brow the reaper turned,"
12193,(BYRON),"(Humming, of course, in his delightful way,"
12194,(BYRON),"How Lycidas was dead, and how concerned"
12195,(BYRON),The Nymphs were when they saw his lifeless clay;
12196,(BYRON),And how rock told to rock the dreadful story
12197,(BYRON),That poor young Lycidas was gone to glory:)

12201,(BYRON),"How had the mists that dimmed his eye been riven,"
12202,(BYRON),And Lycidas and sorrow all forgot!
12203,(BYRON),"If his own grandmother had died unshriven,"
12204,(BYRON),In two short seconds he'd have recked it not;

12215,(BYRON),Recruits her flagging powers with bottled stout.
12216,(BYRON),
12217,(BYRON),"But what is coffee, but a noxious berry,"
12218,(BYRON),Born to keep used-up Londoners awake?
12219,(BYRON),"What is Falernian, what is Port or Sherry,"
12220,(BYRON),But vile concoctions to make dull heads ache?
12221,(BYRON),"Nay stout itself--(though good with oysters, very)--"
12222,(BYRON),Is not a thing your reading man should take.

12227,(BYRON),A soft and silvery sound--I know it well.
12228,(BYRON),Its tinkling tells me that a time is near
12229,(BYRON),Precious to me--it is the Dinner Bell.
12230,(BYRON),"O blessed Bell! Thou bringest beef and beer,"
12231,(BYRON),Thou bringest good things more than tongue may tell:
12232,(BYRON),Seared is (of course) my heart--but unsubdued
12233,(BYRON),"Is, and shall be, my appetite for food."
12234,(BYRON),
12235,(BYRON),I go. Untaught and feeble is my pen:
12236,(BYRON),But on one statement I may safely venture:
12237,(BYRON),That few of our most highly gifted men
12238,(BYRON),Have more appreciation of the trencher.
12239,(BYRON),"I go. One pound of British beef, and then"
12240,(BYRON),What Mr. Swiveller called 'a modest quencher';

12880,(LONGFELLOW),"(Author of 'The Stones of Venice,'"
12881,(LONGFELLOW),"'Seven Lamps of Architecture,'"
12882,(LONGFELLOW),"'Modern Painters,' and some others);"
12883,(LONGFELLOW),And perhaps he had not fully
12884,(LONGFELLOW),Understood his author's meaning;
12885,(LONGFELLOW),"But, whatever was the reason,"
12886,(LONGFELLOW),"All was fruitless, as the picture"
12887,(LONGFELLOW),Ended in an utter failure.
12888,(LONGFELLOW),Next to him the eldest daughter:
12889,(LONGFELLOW),She suggested very little;
12890,(LONGFELLOW),Only asked if he would take her
12891,(LONGFELLOW),With her look of 'passive beauty.'
12892,(LONGFELLOW),Her idea of passive beauty
12893,(LONGFELLOW),"Was a squinting of the left-eye,"
12894,(LONGFELLOW),"Was a drooping of the right-eye,"
12895,(LONGFELLOW),Was a smile that went up sideways
12896,(LONGFELLOW),To the corner of the nostrils.
12897,(LONGFELLOW),"Hiawatha, when she asked him,"
12898,(LONGFELLOW),"Took no notice of the question,"
12899,(LONGFELLOW),Looked as if he hadn't heard it;
12900,(LONGFELLOW),"But, when pointedly appealed to,"
12901,(LONGFELLOW),"Smiled in his peculiar manner,"
12902,(LONGFELLOW),"Coughed and said it 'didn't matter,'"
12903,(LONGFELLOW),Bit his lip and changed the subject.
12904,(LONGFELLOW),"Nor in this was he mistaken,"
12905,(LONGFELLOW),As the picture failed completely.
12906,(LONGFELLOW),So in turn the other sisters.
12907,(LONGFELLOW),"Last, the youngest son was taken:"
12908,(LONGFELLOW),"Very rough and thick his hair was,"
12909,(LONGFELLOW),"Very round and red his face was,"
12910,(LONGFELLOW),"Very dusty was his jacket,"
12911,(LONGFELLOW),Very fidgetty his manner.
12912,(LONGFELLOW),And his overbearing sisters
12913,(LONGFELLOW),Called him names he disapproved of:
12914,(LONGFELLOW),"Called him Johnny, 'Daddy's Darling,'"
12915,(LONGFELLOW),"Called him Jacky, 'Scrubby School-boy,'"
12916,(LONGFELLOW),"And, so awful was the picture,"
12917,(LONGFELLOW),In comparison the others
12918,(LONGFELLOW),"Might be thought to have succeeded,"
12919,(LONGFELLOW),To have partially succeeded.
12920,(LONGFELLOW),Finally my Hiawatha
12921,(LONGFELLOW),"Tumbled all the tribe together,"
12922,(LONGFELLOW),"'Grouped' is not the right expression,)"
12923,(LONGFELLOW),"And, as happy chance would have it,"
12924,(LONGFELLOW),Did at last obtain a picture
12925,(LONGFELLOW),Where the faces all succeeded:
12926,(LONGFELLOW),Each came out a perfect likeness.
12927,(LONGFELLOW),"Then they joined and all abused it,"
12928,(LONGFELLOW),"Unrestrainedly abused it,"
12929,(LONGFELLOW),As 'the worst and ugliest picture
12930,(LONGFELLOW),They could possibly have dreamed of.
12931,(LONGFELLOW),Giving one such strange expressions!
12932,(LONGFELLOW),"Sulkiness, conceit, and meanness!"
12933,(LONGFELLOW),Really any one would take us
12934,(LONGFELLOW),(Any one that did not know us)
12935,(LONGFELLOW),For the most unpleasant people!'
12936,(LONGFELLOW),"(Hiawatha seemed to think so,"
12937,(LONGFELLOW),Seemed to think it not unlikely.)
12938,(LONGFELLOW),"All together rang their voices,"
12939,(LONGFELLOW),"Angry, loud, discordant voices,"
12940,(LONGFELLOW),"As of dogs that howl in concert,"
12941,(LONGFELLOW),As of cats that wail in chorus.
12942,(LONGFELLOW),"But my Hiawatha's patience,"
12943,(LONGFELLOW),"His politeness and his patience,"
12944,(LONGFELLOW),"Unaccountably had vanished,"
12945,(LONGFELLOW),And he left that happy party.
12946,(LONGFELLOW),"Neither did he leave them slowly,"
12947,(LONGFELLOW),"With that calm deliberation,"
12948,(LONGFELLOW),That intense deliberation
12949,(LONGFELLOW),Which photographers aspire to:
12950,(LONGFELLOW),"But he left them in a hurry,"
12951,(LONGFELLOW),"Left them in a mighty hurry,"
12952,(LONGFELLOW),Vowing that he would not stand it.
12953,(LONGFELLOW),"Hurriedly he packed his boxes,"
12954,(LONGFELLOW),Hurriedly the porter trundled
12955,(LONGFELLOW),On a barrow all his boxes;
12956,(LONGFELLOW),"Hurriedly he took his ticket,"
12957,(LONGFELLOW),Hurriedly the train received him:
12958,(LONGFELLOW),Thus departed Hiawatha.
12959,(LONGFELLOW),
12960,(LONGFELLOW),
12961,THE THREE VOICES.,THE THREE VOICES.
12962,THE THREE VOICES.,
12963,(TENNYSON),(TENNYSON)
12964,(TENNYSON),
12965,(TENNYSON),
12966,(TENNYSON),_The First Voice._
12967,(TENNYSON),
12968,(TENNYSON),"With hands tight clenched through matted hair,"
12969,(TENNYSON),He crouched in trance of dumb despair:
12970,(TENNYSON),There came a breeze from out the air.
12971,(TENNYSON),
12972,(TENNYSON),It passed athwart the glooming flat--
12973,(TENNYSON),It fanned his forehead as he sat--
12974,(TENNYSON),"It lightly bore away his hat,"
12975,(TENNYSON),
12976,(TENNYSON),All to the feet of one who stood
12977,(TENNYSON),"Like maid enchanted in a wood,"
12978,(TENNYSON),Frowning as darkly as she could.
12979,(TENNYSON),
12980,(TENNYSON),"With huge umbrella, lank and brown,"
12981,(TENNYSON),"Unerringly she pinned it down,"
12982,(TENNYSON),Right through the centre of the crown.
12983,(TENNYSON),
12984,(TENNYSON),"Then, with an aspect cold and grim,"
12985,(TENNYSON),"Regardless of its battered rim,"
12986,(TENNYSON),She took it up and gave it him.
12987,(TENNYSON),
12988,(TENNYSON),"Awhile like one in dreams he stood,"
12989,(TENNYSON),"Then faltered forth his gratitude,"
12990,(TENNYSON),In words just short of being rude:
12991,(TENNYSON),
12992,(TENNYSON),"For it had lost its shape and shine,"
12993,(TENNYSON),"And it had cost him four-and-nine,"
12994,(TENNYSON),And he was going out to dine.
12995,(TENNYSON),
12996,(TENNYSON),"With grave indifference to his speech,"
12997,(TENNYSON),"Fixing her eyes upon the beach,"
12998,(TENNYSON),She said 'Each gives to more than each.'
12999,(TENNYSON),
13000,(TENNYSON),He could not answer yea or nay:
13001,(TENNYSON),He faltered 'Gifts may pass away.'
13002,(TENNYSON),Yet knew not what he meant to say.
13003,(TENNYSON),
13004,(TENNYSON),"'If that be so,' she straight replied,"
13005,(TENNYSON),'Each heart with each doth coincide.
13006,(TENNYSON),What boots it? For the world is wide.'
13007,(TENNYSON),
13008,(TENNYSON),"And he, not wishing to appear"
13009,(TENNYSON),"Less wise, said 'This Material Sphere"
13010,(TENNYSON),Is but Attributive Idea.'
13011,(TENNYSON),
13012,(TENNYSON),But when she asked him 'Wherefore so?'
13013,(TENNYSON),"He felt his very whiskers glow,"
13014,(TENNYSON),And frankly owned 'I do not know.'
13015,(TENNYSON),
13016,(TENNYSON),"While, like broad waves of golden grain."
13017,(TENNYSON),"Or sunlit hues on cloistered pane,"
13018,(TENNYSON),His colour came and went again.
13019,(TENNYSON),
13020,(TENNYSON),"Pitying his obvious distress,"
13021,(TENNYSON),"Yet with a tinge of bitterness,"
13022,(TENNYSON),She said 'The More exceeds the Less.'
13023,(TENNYSON),
13024,(TENNYSON),"'A truth of such undoubted weight,"
13025,(TENNYSON),"He urged, 'and so extreme in date,"
13026,(TENNYSON),It were superfluous to state.'
13027,(TENNYSON),
13028,(TENNYSON),"Roused into sudden passion, she"
13029,(TENNYSON),In tone of cold malignity:
13030,(TENNYSON),"'To others, yes: but not to thee.'"
13031,(TENNYSON),
13032,(TENNYSON),"But when she saw him quail and quake,"
13033,(TENNYSON),And when he urged 'For pity's sake!'
13034,(TENNYSON),Once more in gentle tone she spake.
13035,(TENNYSON),
13036,(TENNYSON),'Thought in the mind doth still abide;
13037,(TENNYSON),"That is by Intellect supplied,"
13038,(TENNYSON),And within that Idea doth hide.
13039,(TENNYSON),
13040,(TENNYSON),"'And he, that yearns the truth to know,"
13041,(TENNYSON),"Still further inwardly may go,"
13042,(TENNYSON),And find Idea from Notion flow.
13043,(TENNYSON),
13044,(TENNYSON),"'And thus the chain, that sages sought,"
13045,(TENNYSON),"Is to a glorious circle wrought,"
13046,(TENNYSON),For Notion hath its source in Thought.'
13047,(TENNYSON),
13048,(TENNYSON),"When he, with racked and whirling brain,"
13049,(TENNYSON),"Feebly implored her to explain,"
13050,(TENNYSON),She simply said it all again.
13051,(TENNYSON),
13052,(TENNYSON),"Wrenched with an agony intense,"
13053,(TENNYSON),"He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense,"
13054,(TENNYSON),And careless of all consequence:
13055,(TENNYSON),
13056,(TENNYSON),'Mind--I believe--is Essence--Ent--
13057,(TENNYSON),Abstract--that is--an Accident--
13058,(TENNYSON),Which we--that is to say--I meant--'
13059,(TENNYSON),
13060,(TENNYSON),"When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed,"
13061,(TENNYSON),"At length his speech was somewhat hushed,"
13062,(TENNYSON),"She looked at him, and he was crushed."
13063,(TENNYSON),
13064,(TENNYSON),It needed not her calm reply:
13065,(TENNYSON),"She fixed him with a stony eye,"
13066,(TENNYSON),"And he could neither fight nor fly,"
13067,(TENNYSON),
13068,(TENNYSON),"While she dissected, word by word,"
13069,(TENNYSON),"His speech, half guessed at and half heard,"
13070,(TENNYSON),As might a cat a little bird.
13071,(TENNYSON),
13072,(TENNYSON),"Then, having wholly overthrown"
13073,(TENNYSON),"His views, and stripped them to the bone,"
13074,(TENNYSON),Proceeded to unfold her own.
13075,(TENNYSON),
13076,(TENNYSON),"So passed they on with even pace,"
13077,(TENNYSON),Yet gradually one might trace
13078,(TENNYSON),A shadow growing on his face.
13079,(TENNYSON),
13080,(TENNYSON),
13081,(TENNYSON),_The Second Voice._
13082,(TENNYSON),
13083,(TENNYSON),"They walked beside the wave-worn beach,"
13084,(TENNYSON),"Her tongue was very apt to teach,"
13085,(TENNYSON),And now and then he did beseech
13086,(TENNYSON),
13087,(TENNYSON),"She would abate her dulcet tone,"
13088,(TENNYSON),"Because the talk was all her own,"
13089,(TENNYSON),And he was dull as any drone.
13090,(TENNYSON),
13091,(TENNYSON),She urged 'No cheese is made of chalk':
13092,(TENNYSON),"And ceaseless flowed her dreary talk,"
13093,(TENNYSON),Tuned to the footfall of a walk.
13094,(TENNYSON),
13095,(TENNYSON),"Her voice was very full and rich,"
13096,(TENNYSON),"And, when at length she asked him 'Which?'"
13097,(TENNYSON),It mounted to its highest pitch.
13098,(TENNYSON),
13099,(TENNYSON),"He a bewildered answer gave,"
13100,(TENNYSON),"Drowned in the sullen moaning wave,"
13101,(TENNYSON),Lost in the echoes of the cave.
13102,(TENNYSON),
13103,(TENNYSON),He answered her he knew not what:
13104,(TENNYSON),Like shaft from bow at random shot:
13105,(TENNYSON),"He spoke, but she regarded not."
13106,(TENNYSON),
13107,(TENNYSON),"She waited not for his reply,"
13108,(TENNYSON),But with a downward leaden eye
13109,(TENNYSON),Went on as if he were not by.
13110,(TENNYSON),
13111,(TENNYSON),"Sound argument and grave defence,"
13112,(TENNYSON),Strange questions raised on 'Why?' and 'Whence?'
13113,(TENNYSON),And weighted down with common sense.
13114,(TENNYSON),
13115,(TENNYSON),'Shall Man be Man? And shall he miss
13116,(TENNYSON),"Of other thoughts no thought but this,"
13117,(TENNYSON),Harmonious dews of sober bliss?
13118,(TENNYSON),
13119,(TENNYSON),'What boots it? Shall his fevered eye
13120,(TENNYSON),Through towering nothingness descry
13121,(TENNYSON),The grisly phantom hurry by?
13122,(TENNYSON),
13123,(TENNYSON),'And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air;
13124,(TENNYSON),"See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare"
13125,(TENNYSON),And redden in the dusky glare?
13126,(TENNYSON),
13127,(TENNYSON),"'The meadows breathing amber light,"
13128,(TENNYSON),"The darkness toppling from the height,"
13129,(TENNYSON),The feathery train of granite Night?
13130,(TENNYSON),
13131,(TENNYSON),"'Shall he, grown gray among his peers,"
13132,(TENNYSON),Through the thick curtain of his tears
13133,(TENNYSON),"Catch glimpses of his earlier years,"
13134,(TENNYSON),
13135,(TENNYSON),"'And hear the sounds he knew of yore,"
13136,(TENNYSON),"Old shufflings on the sanded floor,"
13137,(TENNYSON),Old knuckles tapping at the door?
13138,(TENNYSON),
13139,(TENNYSON),'Yet still before him as he flies
13140,(TENNYSON),"One pallid form shall ever rise,"
13141,(TENNYSON),"And, bodying forth in glassy eyes"
13142,(TENNYSON),
13143,(TENNYSON),"'The vision of a vanished good,"
13144,(TENNYSON),"Low peering through the tangled wood,"
13145,(TENNYSON),Shall freeze the current of his blood.'
13146,(TENNYSON),
13147,(TENNYSON),"Still from each fact, with skill uncouth"
13148,(TENNYSON),"And savage rapture, like a tooth"
13149,(TENNYSON),She wrenched a slow reluctant truth.
13150,(TENNYSON),
13151,(TENNYSON),"Till, like some silent water-mill,"
13152,(TENNYSON),"When summer suns have dried the rill,"
13153,(TENNYSON),"She reached a full stop, and was still."
13154,(TENNYSON),
13155,(TENNYSON),"Dead calm succeeded to the fuss,"
13156,(TENNYSON),As when the loaded omnibus
13157,(TENNYSON),Has reached the railway terminus:
13158,(TENNYSON),
13159,(TENNYSON),"When, for the tumult of the street,"
13160,(TENNYSON),"Is heard the engine's stifled beat,"
13161,(TENNYSON),The velvet tread of porters' feet.
13162,(TENNYSON),
13163,(TENNYSON),"With glance that ever sought the ground,"
13164,(TENNYSON),"She moved her lips without a sound,"
13165,(TENNYSON),And every now and then she frowned.
13166,(TENNYSON),
13167,(TENNYSON),"He gazed upon the sleeping sea,"
13168,(TENNYSON),"And joyed in its tranquillity,"
13169,(TENNYSON),"And in that silence dead, but she"
13170,(TENNYSON),
13171,(TENNYSON),"To muse a little space did seem,"
13172,(TENNYSON),"Then, like the echo of a dream,"
13173,(TENNYSON),Harped back upon her threadbare theme.
13174,(TENNYSON),
13175,(TENNYSON),"Still an attentive ear he lent,"
13176,(TENNYSON),But could not fathom what she meant:
13177,(TENNYSON),"She was not deep, nor eloquent."
13178,(TENNYSON),
13179,(TENNYSON),He marked the ripple on the sand:
13180,(TENNYSON),The even swaying of her hand
13181,(TENNYSON),Was all that he could understand.
13182,(TENNYSON),
13183,(TENNYSON),"He left her, and he turned aside:"
13184,(TENNYSON),He sat and watched the coming tide
13185,(TENNYSON),Across the shores so newly dried.
13186,(TENNYSON),
13187,(TENNYSON),"He wondered at the waters clear,"
13188,(TENNYSON),"The breeze that whispered in his ear,"
13189,(TENNYSON),The billows heaving far and near;
13190,(TENNYSON),
13191,(TENNYSON),And why he had so long preferred
13192,(TENNYSON),To hang upon her every word;
13193,(TENNYSON),"'In truth,' he said, 'it was absurd.'"
13194,(TENNYSON),
13195,(TENNYSON),
13196,(TENNYSON),_The Third Voice._
13197,(TENNYSON),
13198,(TENNYSON),Not long this transport held its place:
13199,(TENNYSON),Within a little moment's space
13200,(TENNYSON),Quick tears were raining down his face.
13201,(TENNYSON),
13202,(TENNYSON),"His heart stood still, aghast with fear;"
13203,(TENNYSON),"A wordless voice, nor far nor near,"
13204,(TENNYSON),He seemed to hear and not to hear.
13205,(TENNYSON),
13206,(TENNYSON),'Tears kindle not the doubtful spark:
13207,(TENNYSON),"If so, why not? Of this remark"
13208,(TENNYSON),The bearings are profoundly dark.'
13209,(TENNYSON),
13210,(TENNYSON),"'Her speech,' he said, 'hath caused this pain;"
13211,(TENNYSON),Easier I count it to explain
13212,(TENNYSON),"The jargon of the howling main,"
13213,(TENNYSON),
13214,(TENNYSON),"'Or, stretched beside some sedgy brook,"
13215,(TENNYSON),"To con, with inexpressive look,"
13216,(TENNYSON),An unintelligible book.'
13217,(TENNYSON),
13218,(TENNYSON),"Low spake the voice within his head,"
13219,(TENNYSON),"In words imagined more than said,"
13220,(TENNYSON),Soundless as ghost's intended tread:
13221,(TENNYSON),
13222,(TENNYSON),"'If thou art duller than before,"
13223,(TENNYSON),Why quittedst thou the voice of lore?
13224,(TENNYSON),"Why not endure, expecting more?'"
13225,(TENNYSON),
13226,(TENNYSON),"'Rather than that,' he groaned aghast,"
13227,(TENNYSON),"'I'd writhe in depths of cavern vast,"
13228,(TENNYSON),Some loathly vampire's rich repast.'
13229,(TENNYSON),
13230,(TENNYSON),"''Twere hard,' it answered, 'themes immense"
13231,(TENNYSON),To coop within the narrow fence
13232,(TENNYSON),That rings _thy_ scant intelligence.'
13233,(TENNYSON),
13234,(TENNYSON),"'Not so,' he urged, 'nor once alone:"
13235,(TENNYSON),But there was that within her tone
13236,(TENNYSON),Which chilled me to the very bone.
13237,(TENNYSON),
13238,(TENNYSON),"'Her style was anything but clear,"
13239,(TENNYSON),And most unpleasantly severe;
13240,(TENNYSON),Her epithets were very queer.
13241,(TENNYSON),
13242,(TENNYSON),"'And yet, so grand were her replies,"
13243,(TENNYSON),I could not choose but deem her wise;
13244,(TENNYSON),I did not dare to criticise;
13245,(TENNYSON),
13246,(TENNYSON),"'Nor did I leave her, till she went"
13247,(TENNYSON),So deep in tangled argument
13248,(TENNYSON),"That all my powers of thought were spent,'"
13249,(TENNYSON),
13250,(TENNYSON),A little whisper inly slid;
13251,(TENNYSON),'Yet truth is truth: you know you did--'
13252,(TENNYSON),A little wink beneath the lid.
13253,(TENNYSON),
13254,(TENNYSON),"And, sickened with excess of dread,"
13255,(TENNYSON),"Prone to the dust he bent his head,"
13256,(TENNYSON),And lay like one three-quarters dead.
13257,(TENNYSON),
13258,(TENNYSON),Forth went the whisper like a breeze;
13259,(TENNYSON),"Left him amid the wondering trees,"
13260,(TENNYSON),Left him by no means at his ease.
13261,(TENNYSON),
13262,(TENNYSON),"Once more he weltered in despair,"
13263,(TENNYSON),"With hands, through denser-matted hair,"
13264,(TENNYSON),More tightly clenched than then they were.
13265,(TENNYSON),
13266,(TENNYSON),"When, bathed in dawn of living red,"
13267,(TENNYSON),"Majestic frowned the mountain head,"
13268,(TENNYSON),"'Tell me my fault,' was all he said."
13269,(TENNYSON),
13270,(TENNYSON),"When, at high noon, the blazing sky"
13271,(TENNYSON),"Scorched in his head each haggard eye,"
13272,(TENNYSON),Then keenest rose his weary cry.
13273,(TENNYSON),
13274,(TENNYSON),And when at eve the unpitying sun
13275,(TENNYSON),"Smiled grimly on the solemn fun,"
13276,(TENNYSON),"'Alack,' he sighed, 'what _have_ I done?'"
13277,(TENNYSON),
13278,(TENNYSON),"But saddest, darkest was the sight,"
13279,(TENNYSON),When the cold grasp of leaden Night
13280,(TENNYSON),"Dashed him to earth, and held him tight."
13281,(TENNYSON),
13282,(TENNYSON),"Tortured, unaided, and alone,"
13283,(TENNYSON),"Thunders were silence to his groan,"
13284,(TENNYSON),Bagpipes sweet music to its tone:
13285,(TENNYSON),
13286,(TENNYSON),"'What? Ever thus, in dismal round,"
13287,(TENNYSON),Shall Pain and Misery profound
13288,(TENNYSON),"Pursue me like a sleepless hound,"
13289,(TENNYSON),
13290,(TENNYSON),"'With crimson-dashed and eager jaws,"
13291,(TENNYSON),"Me, still in ignorance of the cause,"
13292,(TENNYSON),Unknowing what I brake of laws?'
13293,(TENNYSON),
13294,(TENNYSON),The whisper to his ear did seem
13295,(TENNYSON),"Like echoed flow of silent stream,"
13296,(TENNYSON),Or shadow of forgotten dream;
13297,(TENNYSON),
13298,(TENNYSON),The whisper trembling in the wind:
13299,(TENNYSON),"'Her fate with thine was intertwined,'"

13616,(E. A. POE),

13802,(E. B. BROWNING),"And I recognize, in spite of all the terrene smut and smother,"
13803,(E. B. BROWNING),"In the colours shaded off thee, the suggestions of a soul."
13804,(E. B. BROWNING),
13805,(E. B. BROWNING),"'Yea,' the poet said, 'I smell thee by some passive divination,"
13806,(E. B. BROWNING),I am satisfied with insight of the measure of thine house;
13807,(E. B. BROWNING),"What had happened I conjecture, in a blank and rhythmic passion,"
13808,(E. B. BROWNING),"Had the æons thought of making thee a man, and me a louse."
13809,(E. B. BROWNING),
13810,(E. B. BROWNING),"'The broad lives of upper planets, their absorption and digestion,"
13811,(E. B. BROWNING),"Food and famine, health and sickness, I can scrutinize and test;"
13812,(E. B. BROWNING),"Through a shiver of the senses comes a resonance of question,"
13813,(E. B. BROWNING),And by proof of balanced answer I decide that I am best.
13814,(E. B. BROWNING),
13815,(E. B. BROWNING),"'Man, the fleshly marvel, alway feels a certain kind of awe stick"
13816,(E. B. BROWNING),"To the skirts of contemplation, cramped with nympholeptic weight:"
13817,(E. B. BROWNING),Feels his faint sense charred and branded by the touch of solar

13917,(PATMORE),"Pink as the unshell'd inner fruit,"

13920,(PATMORE),"But when the petticoats were on,"
13921,(PATMORE),"'I know,' I said; 'its name shall be"

13923,(PATMORE),"'Why,' said my wife, 'the child's a girl.'"
13924,(PATMORE),"My brain swooned, sick with failing sense;"

13928,(PATMORE),"'Nay,' smiled the nurse, 'the child's a boy.'"
13929,(PATMORE),And all my soul was soothed to hear
13930,(PATMORE),That so it was: then startled Joy
13931,(PATMORE),Mocked Sorrow with a doubtful tear.
13932,(PATMORE),And I was glad as one who sees
13933,(PATMORE),For sensual optics things unmeet:
13934,(PATMORE),"As purity makes passion freeze,"
13935,(PATMORE),So faith warns science off her beat.
13936,(PATMORE),"Blessed are they that have not seen,"

14054,MRS. JUDGE JENKINS.,
14055,(WHITTIER),(WHITTIER)
14056,(WHITTIER),
14057,(WHITTIER),Maud Muller all that summer day
14058,(WHITTIER),Raked the meadows sweet with hay;
14059,(WHITTIER),
14060,(WHITTIER),"Yet, looking down the distant lane,"
14061,(WHITTIER),She hoped the judge would come again.
14062,(WHITTIER),
14063,(WHITTIER),"But when he came, with smile and bow,"
14064,(WHITTIER),"Maud only blushed, and stammered, 'Ha-ow?'"
14065,(WHITTIER),
14066,(WHITTIER),"And spoke of her 'pa,' and wondered whether"
14067,(WHITTIER),He'd give consent they should wed together.
14068,(WHITTIER),
14069,(WHITTIER),"Old Muller burst in tears, and then"
14070,(WHITTIER),Begged that the judge would lend him 'ten';
14071,(WHITTIER),
14072,(WHITTIER),"For trade was dull, and wages low,"
14073,(WHITTIER),And the 'craps' this year were somewhat slow.
14074,(WHITTIER),
14075,(WHITTIER),"And ere the languid summer died,"
14076,(WHITTIER),Sweet Maud became the judge's bride.
14077,(WHITTIER),
14078,(WHITTIER),But on the day that they were mated
14079,(WHITTIER),Maud's brother Bob was intoxicated;
14080,(WHITTIER),
14081,(WHITTIER),"And Maud's relations, twelve in all,"
14082,(WHITTIER),Were very drunk at the judge's hall.
14083,(WHITTIER),
14084,(WHITTIER),"And when the summer came again,"
14085,(WHITTIER),The young bride bore him babies twain.
14086,(WHITTIER),
14087,(WHITTIER),"And the judge was blest, but thought it strange"
14088,(WHITTIER),That bearing children made such a change:
14089,(WHITTIER),
14090,(WHITTIER),For Maud grew broad and red and stout:
14091,(WHITTIER),And the waist that his arm once clasped about
14092,(WHITTIER),
14093,(WHITTIER),Was more than he now could span; and he
14094,(WHITTIER),"Sighed as he pondered, ruefully,"
14095,(WHITTIER),
14096,(WHITTIER),How that which in Maud was native grace
14097,(WHITTIER),In Mrs. Jenkins was out of place;
14098,(WHITTIER),
14099,(WHITTIER),"And thought of the twins, and wished that they"
14100,(WHITTIER),Looked less like the man who raked the hay
14101,(WHITTIER),
14102,(WHITTIER),"On Muller's farm, and dreamed with pain"
14103,(WHITTIER),"Of the day he wandered down the lane,"
14104,(WHITTIER),
14105,(WHITTIER),"And, looking down that dreary track,"
14106,(WHITTIER),He half regretted that he came back.
14107,(WHITTIER),
14108,(WHITTIER),"For, had he waited, he might have wed"
14109,(WHITTIER),Some maiden fair and thoroughbred;
14110,(WHITTIER),
14111,(WHITTIER),"For there be women fair as she,"
14112,(WHITTIER),Whose verbs and nouns do more agree.
14113,(WHITTIER),
14114,(WHITTIER),Alas for maiden! alas for judge!
14115,(WHITTIER),"And the sentimental,--that's one-half 'fudge';"
14116,(WHITTIER),
14117,(WHITTIER),"For Maud soon thought the judge a bore,"
14118,(WHITTIER),With all his learning and all his lore.
14119,(WHITTIER),
14120,(WHITTIER),And the judge would have bartered Maud's fair face
14121,(WHITTIER),For more refinement and social grace.
14122,(WHITTIER),
14123,(WHITTIER),"If, of all words of tongue and pen,"
14124,(WHITTIER),"The saddest are, 'It might have been,'"
14125,(WHITTIER),
14126,(WHITTIER),More sad are these we daily see:
14127,(WHITTIER),"'It is, but hadn't ought to be.'"

14157,(POE),"For I knew not the month was October,"
14158,(POE),"And I marked not the night of the year,"
14159,(POE),I forgot that sweet _morceau_ of Auber
14160,(POE),"That the band oft performed down here,"

14212,(POE),"And I cried, 'It was surely October,"

14846,(BRET HARTE),"One of Bohn's publications, so useful"
14847,(BRET HARTE),To the student of Latin or Greek.
14848,(BRET HARTE),
14849,(BRET HARTE),In the crown of his cap
14850,(BRET HARTE),"Were the Furies and Fates,"
14851,(BRET HARTE),And a delicate map
14852,(BRET HARTE),"Of the Dorian States,"
14853,(BRET HARTE),"And we found in his palms which were hollow,"

15274,(GRAY),Beyond the round of work and play

15276,(GRAY),

15284,(GRAY),And finding all the world abuse
15285,(GRAY),"My simple unpretending views,"
15286,(GRAY),I thought I'd go and see.
15287,(GRAY),
15288,(GRAY),I boldly left the College bounds:
15289,(GRAY),"Across the sea I went,"
15290,(GRAY),To probe the economic grounds
15291,(GRAY),Of Irish discontent.
15292,(GRAY),My constant goings to and fro

15309,(GRAY),
15310,(GRAY),Our stern head-master spoke to me

15322,(GRAY),Is all unfit to teach:
15323,(GRAY),And literary fame is quite

15327,(GRAY),I am compelled to sacrifice.

15963,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"authors, thus infallibly classed with the _genus irritabile_,"
15964,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"it would be very hard to deny six staunch friends, who"
15965,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"consider his the best of all possible 'Addresses,' and"
15966,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"whose tongues will be as ready to laud him, as to hiss his"
15967,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"adversary. These, with the potent aid of the Bard himself,"
15968,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,make seven foes per Address; and thus will be created seven
15969,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"hundred and seventy-seven implacable auditors, prepared to"
15970,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,condemn the strains of Apollo himself--a band of adversaries
15971,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,which no prudent manager would think of exasperating.
15972,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
15973,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"But, leaving the Committee to encounter the responsibility"
15974,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"they have incurred, the public have at least to thank them"
15975,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"for ascertaining and establishing one point, which might"
15976,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,otherwise have admitted of controversy. When it is considered
15977,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,that many amateur writers have been discouraged from becoming
15978,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"competitors, and that few, if any, of the professional authors"
15979,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"can afford to write for nothing, and, of course, have not"
15980,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"been candidates for the honorary prize at Drury Lane, we may"
15981,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"confidently pronounce that, as far as regards NUMBER,"
15982,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,the present is undoubtedly the Augustan age of English
15983,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,poetry. Whether or not this distinction will be extended to
15984,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the QUALITY of its productions, must be decided at"
15985,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,the tribunal of posterity; though the natural anxiety of our
15986,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,authors on this score ought to be considerably diminished when
15987,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"they reflect how few will, in all probability, be had up for"
15988,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,judgement.
15989,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
15990,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,It is not necessary for the Editor to mention the manner
15991,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,in which he became possessed of this 'fair sample of the
15992,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,present state of poetry in Great Britain.' It was his first
15993,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,intention to publish the whole; but a little reflection
15994,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"convinced him that, by so doing, he might depress the good,"
15995,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,without elevating the bad. He has therefore culled what had
15996,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the appearance of flowers, from what possessed the reality"
15997,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"of weeds, and is extremely sorry that, in so doing, he has"
15998,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,diminished his collection to twenty-one. Those which he has
15999,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,rejected may possibly make their appearance in a separate
16000,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"volume, or they may be admitted as volunteers in the files"
16001,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"of some of the Newspapers; or, at all events, they are sure"
16002,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,of being received among the awkward squad of the Magazines.
16003,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"In general, they bear a close resemblance to each other;"
16004,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,thirty of them contain extravagant compliments to the immortal
16005,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"Wellington and the indefatigable Whitbread; and, as the"
16006,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,last-mentioned gentleman is said to dislike praise in the
16007,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"exact proportion in which he deserves it, these laudatory"
16008,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,writers may have been only building a wall against which they
16009,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,might run their own heads.
16010,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16011,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,The Editor here begs leave to advance a few words in behalf
16012,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,of that useful and much abused bird the Phœnix; and in
16013,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"so doing he is biased by no partiality, as he assures the"
16014,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"reader he not only never saw one, but (_mirabile dictu!_)"
16015,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,never caged one in a simile in the whole course of his life.
16016,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,Not less than sixty-nine of the competitors have invoked the
16017,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"aid of this native of Arabia; but as, from their manner of"
16018,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"using him after they had caught him, he does not by any means"
16019,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"appear to have been a native of _Arabia Felix_, the Editor has"
16020,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"left the proprietors to treat with Mr. Polito, and refused"
16021,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"to receive this _rara avis_, or black swan, into the present"
16022,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"collection. One exception occurs, in which the admirable"
16023,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"treatment of this feathered incombustible, entitles the author"
16024,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"to great praise; that address has been preserved, and was"
16025,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,thought worthy of taking the lead.
16026,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16027,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,Perhaps the reason why several of the subjoined productions
16028,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"of the MUSÆ LONDINENSES have failed of selection,"
16029,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,may be discovered in their being penned in a metre unusual
16030,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"upon occasions of this sort, and in their not being written"
16031,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"with that attention to stage effect, the want of which, like"
16032,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"want of manners in the concerns of life, is more prejudicial"
16033,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,than a deficiency of talent. There is an art of writing for
16034,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the Theatre, technically called _touch and go_, which is"
16035,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,indispensable when we consider the small quantum of patience
16036,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,which so motley an assemblage as a London audience can be
16037,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,expected to afford. All the contributors have been very exact
16038,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,in sending their initials and mottoes. Those belonging to the
16039,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"present collection have been carefully preserved, and each"
16040,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,has been affixed to its respective poem. The letters that
16041,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,accompanied the Addresses having been honourably destroyed
16042,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"unopened, it is impossible to state the real authors with"
16043,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"any certainty; but the ingenious reader, after comparing the"
16044,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"initials with the motto, and both with the poem will form his"
16045,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,own conclusions.
16046,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16047,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,We do not anticipate any disapprobation from thus giving
16048,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,publicity to a small portion of the _Rejected Addresses_; for
16049,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,unless we are widely mistaken in assigning the respective
16050,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"authors, the fame of each Individual is established on much"
16051,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,too firm a basis to be shaken by so trifling and evanescent a
16052,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,publication as the present:
16053,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16054,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,----neque ego illi detrahere ausim
16055,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,Hærentem capiti multa cum laude coronam.
16056,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16057,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,Of the numerous pieces already sent to the Committee for
16058,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"performance, we have only availed ourselves of three vocal"
16059,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"Travesties, which we have selected, not for their merit,"
16060,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"but simply for their brevity. Above one hundred spectacles,"
16061,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"melodramas, operas, and pantomimes have been transmitted,"
16062,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,besides the two first acts of one legitimate comedy. Some
16063,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"of these evince considerable smartness of manual dialogue,"
16064,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"and several brilliant repartees of chairs, tables, and other"
16065,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,inanimate wits; but the authors seem to have forgotten that in
16066,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,the new Drury Lane the audience can hear as well as see. Of
16067,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"late our theatres have been so constructed, that John Bull has"
16068,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"been compelled to have very long ears, or none at all; to keep"
16069,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"them dangling about his skull like discarded servants, while"
16070,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"his eyes were gazing at piebalds and elephants, or else to"
16071,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,stretch them out to an asinine length to catch the congenial
16072,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"sound of braying trumpets. An auricular revolution is, we"
16073,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"trust, about to take place; and as many people have been much"
16074,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"puzzled to define the meaning of the new era, of which we"
16075,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"have heard so much, we venture to pronounce, that as far as"
16076,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"regards Drury Lane Theatre, the new era means the reign of"
16077,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"ears. If the past affords any pledge for the future, we may"
16078,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,confidently expect from the Committee of that House everything
16079,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,that can be accomplished by the union of taste and assiduity.
16080,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16081,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,The text of the _Rejected Addresses_ here given is that of the
16082,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,eighteenth edition with Horace Smith's annotations. The footnotes from
16083,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,the _Edinburgh Review_ were taken from an article by Lord Jeffrey in
16084,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the number for November, 1812. It may be mentioned that the actual"
16085,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,addresses sent in to the Drury Lane Committee are preserved with
16086,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,their covering letters in the Manuscript Department of the British
16087,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"Museum, and that on the immediate success of the Smiths' parodies an"
16088,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,enterprising publisher issued a volume of _Genuine Rejected Addresses_
16089,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,from the forty-three competitors who responded to his appeal for such.
16090,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16091,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,The following is from the Preface to the eighteenth edition:
16092,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16093,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"Our first difficulty, that of selection, was by no means a"
16094,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"light one. Some of our most eminent poets, such, for instance,"
16095,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"as Rogers and Campbell, presented so much beauty, harmony, and"
16096,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"proportion in their writings, both as to style and sentiment,"
16097,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"that if we had attempted to caricature them, nobody would"
16098,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,have recognized the likeness; and if we had endeavoured to
16099,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"give a servile copy of their manner, it would only have"
16100,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"amounted, at best, to a tame and unamusing portrait, which"
16101,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,it was not our object to present. Although fully aware that
16102,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"their names would, in the theatrical phrase, have conferred"
16103,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"great strength upon our bill, we were reluctantly compelled"
16104,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"to forgo them, and to confine ourselves to writers whose"
16105,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"style and habit of thought, being more marked and peculiar,"
16106,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,was more capable of exaggeration and distortion. To avoid
16107,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"politics and personality, to imitate the turn of mind, as"
16108,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"well as the phraseology of our originals, and, at all events,"
16109,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"to raise a harmless laugh, were our main objects: in the"
16110,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"attainment of which united aims, we were sometimes hurried"
16111,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"into extravagance, by attaching much more importance to the"
16112,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,last than to the two first. In no instance were we thus
16113,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,betrayed into a greater injustice than in the case of Mr.
16114,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"Wordsworth--the touching sentiment, profound wisdom, and"
16115,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"copious harmony of whose loftier writings we left unnoticed,"
16116,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,in the desire of burlesquing them; while we pounced upon
16117,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"his popular ballads, and exerted ourselves to push their"
16118,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,simplicity into puerility and silliness. With pride and
16119,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,pleasure do we now claim to be ranked among the most ardent
16120,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,admirers of this true poet; and if he himself could see the
16121,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"state of his works, which are ever at our right hand, he"
16122,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"would, perhaps, receive the manifest evidences they exhibit of"
16123,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"constant reference, and delighted re-perusal, as some sort of"
16124,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"_amende honorable_ for the unfairness of which we were guilty,"
16125,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,when we were less conversant with the higher inspirations of
16126,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"his muse. To Mr. Coleridge, and others of our originals, we"
16127,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"must also do a tardy act of justice, by declaring that our"
16128,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"burlesque of their peculiarities, has never blinded us to"
16129,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,those beauties and talents which are beyond the reach of all
16130,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,ridicule.
16131,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16132,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"One of us had written a genuine Address for the occasion,"
16133,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"which was sent to the Committee, and shared the fate it"
16134,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"merited, in being rejected. To swell the bulk, or rather to"
16135,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"diminish the tenuity of our little work, we added it to the"
16136,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,Imitations; and prefixing the initials of S. T. P. for the
16137,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"purpose of puzzling the critics, were not a little amused, in"
16138,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the sequel, by the many guesses and conjectures into which"
16139,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,we had ensnared some of our readers. We could even enjoy the
16140,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"mysticism, qualified as it was by the poor compliment, that"
16141,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,our carefully written Address exhibited no 'very prominent
16142,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"trait of absurdity,' when we saw it thus noticed in the"
16143,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"_Edinburgh Review_ for November, 1812. 'An Address by S. T."
16144,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,P. we can make nothing of; and professing our ignorance of
16145,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the author designated by these letters, we can only add, that"
16146,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the Address, though a little affected, and not very full of"
16147,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"meaning, has no very prominent trait of absurdity, that we"
16148,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"can detect; and might have been adopted and spoken, so far"
16149,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"as we can perceive, without any hazard of ridicule. In our"
16150,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"simplicity we consider it as a very decent, mellifluous,"
16151,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,occasional prologue; and do not understand how it has found
16152,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,its way into its present company.'
16153,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16154,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"Urged forward by hurry, and trusting to chance, two very bad"
16155,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"coadjutors in any enterprise, we at length congratulated"
16156,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,ourselves on having completed our task in time to have
16157,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,it printed and published by the opening of the theatre.
16158,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"But, alas! our difficulties, so far from being surmounted,"
16159,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,seemed only to be beginning. Strangers to the arcana of
16160,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the bookseller's trade, and unacquainted with their almost"
16161,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"invincible objection to single volumes of low price,"
16162,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,especially when tendered by writers who have acquired no
16163,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"previous name, we little anticipated that they would refuse"
16164,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"to publish our _Rejected Addresses_, even although we asked"
16165,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"nothing for the copyright. Such however, proved to be the"
16166,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,case. Our manuscript was perused and returned to us by several
16167,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,of the most eminent publishers. Well do we remember betaking
16168,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"ourselves to one of the craft in Bond Street, whom we found in"
16169,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"a back parlour, with his gouty leg propped upon a cushion, in"
16170,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,spite of which warning he diluted his luncheon with frequent
16171,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,glasses of Madeira. 'What have you already written?' was
16172,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"his first question, an interrogatory to which we had been"
16173,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,subjected in almost every instance. 'Nothing by which we can
16174,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,be known.' 'Then I am afraid to undertake the publication.'
16175,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,We presumed timidly to suggest that every writer must have
16176,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"a beginning, and that to refuse to publish for him until he"
16177,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"had acquired a name, was to imitate the sapient mother who"
16178,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,cautioned her son against going into the water until he could
16179,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"swim. 'An old joke--a regular Joe!' exclaimed our companion,"
16180,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"tossing off another bumper. 'Still older than Joe Miller,'"
16181,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"was our reply; 'for, if we mistake not, it is the very first"
16182,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"anecdote in the facetiæ of Hierocles.' 'Ha, sirs!' resumed"
16183,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the bibliopolist, 'you are learned, are you? So, soh!--Well,"
16184,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"leave your manuscript with me; I will look it over to-night,"
16185,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,and give you an answer to-morrow.' Punctual as the clock we
16186,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"presented ourselves at his door on the following morning, when"
16187,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,our papers were returned to us with the observation--'These
16188,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"trifles are really not deficient in smartness; they are well,"
16189,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,vastly well for beginners; but they will never do--never. They
16190,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"would not pay for advertising, and without it I should not"
16191,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,sell fifty copies.'
16192,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16193,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,This was discouraging enough. If the most experienced
16194,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"publishers feared to be out of pocket by the work, it was"
16195,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"manifest, _a fortiori_, that its writers ran a risk of being"
16196,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"still more heavy losers, should they undertake the publication"
16197,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,on their own account. We had no objection to raise a laugh
16198,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"at the expense of others; but to do it at our own cost,"
16199,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"uncertain as we were to what extent we might be involved, had"
16200,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"never entered into our contemplation. In this dilemma, our"
16201,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"_Addresses_, now in every sense rejected, might probably have"
16202,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"never seen the light, had not some good angel whispered us to"
16203,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"betake ourselves to Mr. John Miller, a dramatic publisher,"
16204,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"then residing in Bow Street, Covent Garden. No sooner had this"
16205,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"gentleman looked over our manuscript, than he immediately"
16206,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"offered to take upon himself all the risk of publication,"
16207,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"and to give us half the profits, _should there be any_; a"
16208,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"liberal proposition, with which we gladly closed. So rapid and"
16209,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"decided was its success, at which none were more unfeignedly"
16210,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"astonished than its authors, that Mr. Miller advised us to"
16211,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"collect some _Imitations of Horace_, which had appeared"
16212,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"anonymously in the _Monthly Mirror_, offering to publish"
16213,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,them upon the same terms. We did so accordingly; and as new
16214,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,editions of the _Rejected Addresses_ were called for in quick
16215,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"succession, we were shortly enabled to sell our half copyright"
16216,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"in the two works to Mr. Miller, for one thousand pounds!! We"
16217,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"have entered into this unimportant detail, not to gratify any"
16218,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"vanity of our own, but to encourage such literary beginners as"
16219,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,may be placed in similar circumstances; as well as to impress
16220,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,upon publishers the propriety of giving more consideration to
16221,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the possible merit of the works submitted to them, than to the"
16222,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,mere magic of a name.
16223,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16224,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"To the credit of the _genus irritabile_ be it recorded, that"
16225,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,not one of those whom we had parodied or burlesqued ever
16226,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"betrayed the least soreness on the occasion, or refused to"
16227,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,join in the laugh that we had occasioned. With most of them
16228,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,we subsequently formed acquaintanceship; while some honoured
16229,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"us with an intimacy which still continues, where it has not"
16230,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,been severed by the rude hand of Death. Alas! it is painful
16231,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"to reflect, that of the twelve writers whom we presumed to"
16232,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"imitate, five are now no more; the list of the deceased"
16233,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"being unhappily swelled by the most illustrious of all, the"
16234,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,_clarum et venerabile nomen_ of Sir Walter Scott! From that
16235,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"distinguished writer, whose transcendent talents were only to"
16236,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"be equalled by his virtues and his amiability, we received"
16237,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"favours and notice, both public and private, which it will"
16238,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"be difficult to forget, because we had not the smallest"
16239,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,claim upon his kindness. 'I certainly must have written this
16240,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"myself!' said that fine-tempered man to one of the authors,"
16241,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"pointing to the description of the Fire, 'although I forget"
16242,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"upon what occasion.' Lydia White, a literary lady, who was"
16243,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"prone to feed the lions of the day, invited one of us to"
16244,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"dinner; but, recollecting afterwards that William Spencer"
16245,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"formed one of the party, wrote to the latter to put him off;"
16246,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,telling him that a man was to be at her table whom he 'would
16247,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,not like to meet.' 'Pray who is this whom I should not like
16248,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"to meet?' inquired the poet. 'Oh!' answered the lady, 'one"
16249,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,of those men who have made that shameful attack upon you!'
16250,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,'The very man upon earth I should like to know!' rejoined the
16251,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"lively and careless bard. The two individuals accordingly met,"
16252,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"and have continued fast friends, ever since. Lord Byron, too,"
16253,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"wrote thus to Mr. Murray from Italy--'Tell him we forgive him,"
16254,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,were he twenty times our satirist.'
16255,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16256,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"It may not be amiss to notice, in this place, one criticism of"
16257,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"a Leicestershire clergyman, which may be pronounced unique: 'I"
16258,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"do not see why they should have been rejected,' observed the"
16259,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,matter-of-fact annotator; 'I think some of them very good!'

16261,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,P. 1. _Loyal Effusion._ By Horace Smith. Fitzgerald (1759?-1829) was a
16262,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,ready versifier who was self-appointed laureate of public events for a

16303,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"Verdant antique, like Ninon de l'Enclos;"

16320,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16321,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"P. 29. _Laura Matilda._ Horace Smith, the author of _Drury's Dirge_,"
16322,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"wrote that 'the authors, as in gallantly bound, wish this lady to"
16323,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"continue anonymous,' and as a consequence there have been several"
16324,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,attempts to pierce the veil of anonymity. One annotator boldly 'assumes
16325,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the lady to have been' Letitia Elizabeth Landon (1802-1836), who was"
16326,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,ten years of age when the _Rejected Addresses_ were published. The
16327,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,motto from _The Baviad_ which stands at the head of the parody is
16328,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,sufficient indication that the original was to be found among the
16329,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"'Della Cruscans,' whose 'namby-pamby' verses, after appearing in the"
16330,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"_World_, were published in two volumes as _The British Album_ in 1790"
16331,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,(see the note on p. 405). The chief lady among those sentimentals was
16332,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"'Anna Matilda,' otherwise Hannah Cowley (1743-1809), a dramatist of"
16333,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"considerable, and a poet of but little, ability. As Mrs. Cowley had"
16334,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"died three years before the Addresses were sent in, it is probable"
16335,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,either that the parodists did not know of her death or that they merely
16336,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,meant to make fun of the school of which she was a leader. The passage
16337,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,from Gifford's _Baviad_ given by way of motto is taken from that part
16338,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,of the satire in which the writers of _The British Album_ are more
16339,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,particularly castigated.

16354,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,of the improvisings for which Theodore Hook came to be famous. The
16355,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"description suggests, however, that no particular writer was aimed at"

16582,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"The first sonnet, Coleridge said,"
16583,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
16584,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,had for its object to excite a good-natured laugh at the
16585,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,spirit of doleful egotism and at the recurrence of favourite
16586,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"phrases, with the double object of being at once trite and"
16587,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,licentious. The second was on low creeping language and
16588,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,thoughts under the pretence of _simplicity_. [Lamb had written
16589,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"some months earlier, 'Cultivate simplicity, Coleridge.'] The"

16593,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,decided was the opinion concerning the characteristic vices
16594,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"of my style that a celebrated physician (now, alas! no more)"
16595,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,speaking of me in other respects with his usual kindness to

16771,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,that--
16772,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
16773,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,nothing personal to the author of _Peter Bell_ is intended
16774,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,in this poem. No man ever admired Wordsworth's poetry
16775,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"more;--he read it perpetually, and taught others to"
16776,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"appreciate its beauties.... His idea was that a man gifted,"
16777,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"even as transcendently as the author of _Peter Bell_, with"
16778,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"the highest qualities of genius, must, if he fostered such"
16779,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"errors, be infected with dullness. This poem was written as a"
16780,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,warning--not as a narration of reality. He was unacquainted
16781,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"personally with Wordsworth, or with Coleridge (to whom he"
16782,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"alludes in the fifth part of the poem), and therefore, I"
16783,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"repeat, his poem is purely ideal;--it contains something"

16849,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 219. _Peter Bell: a Lyrical Ballad._ When Wordsworth's _Peter
16850,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Bell_ was announced in 1819, John Hamilton Reynolds wrote--it is said"
16851,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,in a single day--this _Lyrical Ballad_ and hurried it out before
16852,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Wordsworth's poem was issued. The fact that Reynolds used Wordsworth's
16853,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,measure suggests that he had seen a copy of the original. It was a
16854,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,criticism by Leigh Hunt of Wordsworth's _Peter Bell_ and Reynolds'
16855,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,parody that moved Shelley to the writing of _Peter Bell the Third_.
16856,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,To his _Peter Bell_ Reynolds attached a _Preface_ and a short
16857,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"_Supplementary Essay_, also purporting to be written by W. W."
16858,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
16859,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,'It is now (the _Preface_ began) a period of one-and-twenty years
16860,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,since I first wrote some of the most perfect compositions (except
16861,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,certain pieces I have written in my later days) that ever dropped
16862,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,from poetical pen.... It has been my aim and my achievement
16863,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"to deduce moral thunder from buttercups, daisies, celandines, and"
16864,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"(as a poet scarcely inferior to myself, hath it) ""such small deer."""

16868,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"completes the simple system of natural narrative, which I began so"
16869,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"early as 1798. It is written in that pure unlaboured style, which"

16952,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,himself in the _Nonsense Verses_ (see p. 154). Thackeray's serious

16984,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"which, on the authority of Sir Theodore Martin, were solely his own"
16985,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,composition. Several of the _Ballads_ had appeared in periodicals
16986,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,before they were collected and published in book form in 1845.

16994,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,the Laureateship became vacant on the death of Southey.

16997,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,connecting the poet and the oysters in his ballad of the blind _Tim

17007,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Come hither, Evan Cameron!"

17012,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 256. _Sonnet CCCI._ Martin Farquhar Tupper published a volume
17013,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,of _Three Hundred Sonnets_ in 1860. _Punch_ professed to have made
17014,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"an arrangement with him to continue the series, and boldly put the"
17015,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"initials M. F. T. to this parody in the number for May 26, 1860."
17016,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17017,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 257. _You see yon prater called a Beales._ Edmond Beales (1803-1881)
17018,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,was President of the Reform League at the time of the Hyde Park riots.
17019,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,He thus figures in _Punch_ in lines written apropos of tears shed by
17020,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Walpole, Home Secretary, when he learnt of the riots:"
17021,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17022,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Tears at the thought of that Hyde Park affair
17023,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Rise in the eye and trickle down the nose,"
17024,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"In looking on the haughty Edmond Beales,"
17025,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,And thinking of the shrubs that are no more.
17026,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17027,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 258. _The Lay of the Lovelorn._ This is one of the 'Bon Gaultier'
17028,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"_Ballads_, and is included by permission of Messrs. William Blackwood"
17029,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,and Sons. Aytoun had no part in this parody. It was solely Sir Theodore
17030,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Martin's, and in its author's opinion is the best he contributed to"
17031,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,the collection. In the _Book of Ballads_ Sir Theodore was at pains to
17032,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,explain that--
17033,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17034,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,it was precisely the poets whom we most admired that we
17035,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,imitated the most frequently. This was certainly not from
17036,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"any want of reverence, but rather out of the fullness of"
17037,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"our admiration, just as the excess of a lover's fondness"
17038,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,often runs over into raillery of the very qualities that are
17039,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"dearest to his heart. 'Let no one,' says Heine, 'ridicule"
17040,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,mankind unless he loves them.' With no less truth may it be
17041,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"said, Let no one parody a poet unless he loves him. He must"
17042,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"first be penetrated by his spirit, and have steeped his ear in"
17043,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"the music of his verse, before he can reflect these under a"
17044,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,humorous aspect with success.
17045,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17046,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Some excellent parodists have succeeded very well in dissembling their

17066,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17067,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 270. _Cary._ Phoebe Cary wrote many parodies. One entitled _The
17068,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Wife_ is sometimes said to be a burlesque of Wordsworth:
17069,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17070,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Her washing ended with the day,"
17071,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Yet lived she at its close,"
17072,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"And passed the long, long night away"
17073,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,In darning ragged hose.
17074,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17075,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,But when the sun in all his state
17076,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Illumed the eastern skies,"
17077,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,She passed about the kitchen grate
17078,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,And went to making pies.
17079,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17080,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,As a matter of fact this only differs by the use of a few turns from
17081,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17082,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Her suffering ended with the day,"
17083,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,

17093,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 273. _In Immemoriam._ In connexion with these quatrains it may be
17094,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"noted that Whewell (1794-1866), in one of his treatises, published"
17095,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"before _In Memoriam_, dropped into the following sentence: 'No power"
17096,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"on earth, however great, can stretch a cord, however fine, into a"

17105,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17106,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Story told me that Browning sent him the _Echo Club_ last
17107,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"summer, with a note saying it was the best thing of the kind"
17108,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"he had ever seen, and that if he had found the imitations of"

17114,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 281. _All or Nothing._ While parodying Emerson's poetry generally
17115,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Bayard Taylor had probably chiefly in mind _The Sphinx_:
17116,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17117,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"The Sphinx is drowsy,"
17118,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Her wings are furled:
17119,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Her ear is heavy,"
17120,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,She broods on the world.
17121,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17122,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Most of Bayard Taylor's parodies are obviously rather of the poets'

17159,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"tells of the tragic love of twin girls for one man, and this duality"

17198,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17199,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"A man too careful of danger liveth in continual torment,"
17200,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,But a cheerful expecter of the best hath a fountain of joy within

17204,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Speedily gloweth it again, warmed by the live embers of hope;"
17205,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Though the black and heavy surge close above the head for a moment,"

17220,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"the Fairy_, the second line of which recurs: 'Feathers and moss, and a"
17221,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,wisp of hay.' (From _Fly-Leaves_.)
17222,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17223,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 306. _Ballad._ Another burlesque of the same poet. Miss Ingelow
17224,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"attempted to retaliate in _Fated to be Free_, with feeble lines"
17225,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"intended to pour scorn on 'Gifford Crayshaw'--_i.e._, Calverley. (From"
17226,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,_Fly-Leaves_.)
17227,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17228,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"P. 309. _You are old, Father William._ An example of a parody known to"
17229,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"everybody, although the original is known to few. The poem imitated is"
17230,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Southey's 'The Old Man's Comforts, and how he gained them,' beginning:"
17231,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17232,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"You are old, Father William, the young man cried,"
17233,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17234,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,and ending:
17235,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17236,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,In the days of my youth I remember'd my God!
17237,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,And He hath not forgotten my age.
17238,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17239,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 314. _The Three Voices._ Tennyson's _The Two Voices_:
17240,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17241,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,A still small voice spake unto me.
17242,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17243,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"P. 322. _Beautiful Soup._ The authorship of 'Beautiful Snow,' which was"
17244,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"immensely popular in this country as well as in its native America,"
17245,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"cannot be verified. It has been attributed to an unhappy woman, to"
17246,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Major W. A. Sigourney, who was said to have written the verses in 1852,"
17247,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"and who died in 1871, and to a James W. Watson."
17248,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17249,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 323. _Ravings._ Parodying Poe's _Ulalume_:
17250,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17251,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,The skies they were ashen and sober;
17252,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,The leaves they were crisped and sere--
17253,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,The leaves they were withering and sere;
17254,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,It was night in the lonesome October
17255,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Of my most immemorial year;
17256,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,"
17257,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,In the misty mid region of Weir--
17258,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,"
17259,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
17260,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17261,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"P. 324. _The Wedding._ The name, 'Owing Merrythief' (_i.e._, Owen"
17262,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Meredith), invented by Hood the Younger, sufficiently explains the"
17263,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Tennysonian fragrance of these lines.
17264,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17265,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 327. _A Clerk ther was._ The seventy-fifth birthday of that
17266,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"distinguished scholar and oarsman, the late Dr. F. J. Furnivall, was"
17267,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,celebrated by the publication by the Oxford University Press of a
17268,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Festschrift, _An English Miscellany_. Professor Skeat's contribution"
17269,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,was received too late for inclusion among the other tributes in this
17270,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"volume, and it was first published in _The Periodical_, the organ of"
17271,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,the Oxford Press.
17272,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17273,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"P. 330. _A Reminiscence of 'David Garrick,'_ etc. T. W. Robertson's"

17277,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"play, _Our American Cousin_, in which Edward A. Sothern created"
17278,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,something of a furore in 1861-62.
17279,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17280,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"P. 330. _Mr. Buckstone's playhouse_--_i.e._, The Haymarket Theatre."
17281,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17282,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"P. 331. _But at last a lady entered._ Nelly Moore (d. 1869), an actress"

17284,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17285,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Pp. 336-41. From _Specimens of Modern Poets_ | _The Heptalogia_ | _or_
17286,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,| _The Seven against Sense._| a _Cap with Seven Bells_: by permission
17287,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,of Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton and Messrs. Chatto and Windus. The poets
17288,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"parodied are Tennyson, Robert and Mrs. Browning, Coventry Patmore,"
17289,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"'Owen Meredith,' D. G. Rossetti, and Swinburne himself. The _Specimens_"
17290,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,were published anonymously in 1880. The 'Owen Meredith' is particularly
17291,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"severe, and strikes the same note as that of Hood the Younger (p. 324)."
17292,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Swinburne's parody of himself is one of the rare successes of its kind.
17293,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,'The Kid' Idyll is the third part of a parody of _The Angel in the
17294,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,House_.
17295,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17296,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,The _Poet and the Woodlouse_ is presumably suggested by _Lady
17297,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Geraldine's Courtship_.
17298,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17299,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 342. _Bret Harte._ The Bret Harte poems are taken from his _Complete
17300,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Works_ by permission of Messrs. Chatto and Windus and the Houghton,"
17301,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Mifflin Company.
17302,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17303,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 342. _A Geological Madrigal._ Shenstone's verses beginning
17304,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17305,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,I have found out a gift for my fair;
17306,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"I have found where the wood-pigeons breed,"
17307,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17308,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"are in _Hope_, the second part of his _Pastoral Ballad in Four Parts_."
17309,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,The inspiration of Bret Harte's verses is sometimes ridiculously
17310,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,attributed to Herrick.
17311,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17312,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 347. _Vers de Société._ This might have been classed as a parody of
17313,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Praed, but was printed originally as by 'Fritteric Lacquer.' It is here"
17314,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"reprinted, with the two following parodies, from Traill's _Recaptured"

17316,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17317,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 348. _The Puss and the Boots._ This may be compared with Calverley's
17318,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,'The Cock and the Bull' (see p. 301).
17319,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17320,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"P. 350. _After Dilettante Concetti._ See Rossetti's _Sister Helen_,"
17321,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,which commences:
17322,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17323,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"'Why did you melt your waxen man,"
17324,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Sister Helen?
17325,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,To-day is the third since you began.'
17326,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"'The time was long, yet the time ran,"
17327,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Little Brother!'
17328,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"(_O Mother, Mary Mother,"
17329,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Three days to-day, between Hell and Heaven!_)"
17330,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17331,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,The sonnet with which Traill closes is a parody of Sonnet XCVII. of
17332,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"_The House of Life_, beginning:"
17333,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17334,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,'Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been;
17335,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"I am also called No-More, Too-Late, Farewell.'"
17336,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17337,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Pp. 353-7. _Andrew Lang._ The parodies on the Rossetti and Morris
17338,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,styles are taken from Andrew Lang's essay on Thomas Haynes Bayly in
17339,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"_Essays in Little_. 'Bayly,' Mr. Lang wrote, in discussing 'Oh, no, we"
17340,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"never mention her,' 'had now struck the note, the sweet sentimental"
17341,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"note, of the early, innocent, Victorian age.... We should do the trick"
17342,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"quite differently now, more like this.' Here follows 'Love spake to"
17343,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"me,' of which its author says at the end:"
17344,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17345,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"I declare I nearly weep over these lines; for, though they"
17346,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"are only Bayly's sentiment hastily recast in a modern manner,"
17347,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"there is something so very affecting, mouldy, and unwholesome"
17348,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,about them that they sound as if they had been 'written up to'
17349,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,a sketch by a disciple of Mr. Rossetti's.
17350,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17351,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"So, of--"
17352,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17353,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Gaily the Troubadour
17354,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Touched his guitar,"
17355,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17356,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Mr. Lang says, 'Any one of us could get in more local colour for the"
17357,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"money, and give the crusader a cithern or citole instead of a guitar,'"
17358,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"and in proof gives the 'romantic, esoteric, old French poem, ""Sir"
17359,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Ralph.""'"
17360,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17361,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"The two Swinburne parodies are from _Rhymes à la Mode_, 1895. An"
17362,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"earlier _Ballade_, of which that on p. 35 'is an improved version, was"
17363,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,printed in the _St. James's Gazette_ in 1881. The original of this is
17364,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Swinburne's 'A Ballad of Burdens'; of 'The Palace of Bric-a-brac,' 'The"
17365,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Garden of Proserpine':
17366,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17367,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Here, where the world is quiet,"
17368,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Here, where all trouble seems"
17369,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Dead winds' and spent waves' riot
17370,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,In doubtful dreams of dreams.
17371,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17372,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 355. _Brahma._ Emerson's 'If the red slayer think he slays.' This
17373,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,parody is said to have been an impromptu. It is taken from _New
17374,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Collected Rhymes_. All the Lang parodies here are given by permission
17375,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,of Messrs. Longman.
17376,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17377,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Pp. 358-64. _A. C. Hilton._ The parodies by Hilton appeared in the two
17378,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,numbers of _The Light Green_. They are reprinted here by permission of
17379,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Messrs. Metcalfe, Cambridge."
17380,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17381,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"The original of 'Octopus' was clearly 'Dolores,' which appeared in"
17382,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"_Poems and Ballads, First Series_, 1866. The fourth stanza of this,"
17383,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"with which may be compared the fifth stanza of 'Octopus,' runs:"
17384,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17385,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"O lips full of lust and of laughter,"
17386,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Curled snakes that are fed from my breast,"
17387,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Bite hard lest remembrance come after
17388,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,And press with new lips where you pressed.
17389,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"For my heart, too, springs up at the pressure,"
17390,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Mine eyelids, too, moisten and burn;"
17391,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Ah, feed me and fill me with pleasure,"
17392,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Ere pain come in turn.
17393,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17394,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"P. 365. _Home, Sweet Home._ This Fantasia is taken from _Airs from"
17395,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Arcady_, 1885, by permission of Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons."
17396,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17397,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 374. _Ode on a Retrospect._ This Ode was put into the mouth of an
17398,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Eton master named Joynes. Being a Liberal with Nationalist sympathies,"
17399,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,he visited a disturbed district in the North of Ireland (presumably
17400,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"in the summer of 1882), and contrived to get himself arrested, and"
17401,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,imprisoned for a short time. He then wrote a book or pamphlet on the
17402,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"subject, with the result indicated in the verses, which seem to point"
17403,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,to his having withdrawn his work rather than resign his appointment.
17404,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Mr. Joynes still held his mastership when the _Retrospect_ was
17405,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"published in November, 1882, and the popularity of the piece at Eton"
17406,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"was prodigious, especially the admirable line, 'They snatched a fearful"
17407,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Joynes.'
17408,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17409,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 378. _To A. T. M._ 'The K.' was the 'A. T. M.' to whom the piece
17410,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"is addressed--A. T. Myers (Arthur, a physician of some eminence), the"
17411,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,youngest brother of the poet parodied. Sir Herbert Stephen (by whose
17412,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"permission his brother's parodies, from _Lapsus Calami_, are given)"
17413,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"states that in the early days of the Society for Psychical Research,"
17414,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"founded by F. W. H. Myers, and of the study of the newly-named"
17415,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"'telepathy,' such experiments were frequently tried by the members, and"
17416,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,he thinks it highly probable that the incident of Arthur Myers taking
17417,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,peppermint in order to test the ability of an alleged telepathist
17418,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"'in quite another room' to say what it was, took place in fact as"
17419,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,described. 'The K.' was a nickname by which A. T. M. was very generally
17420,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,known among his friends and relations: the reason is obscure.
17421,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17422,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 379. _Wake! for the Ruddy Ball._ This imitation by Francis Thompson
17423,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,of the _Rubaiyat_ was first printed in Mr. E. V. Lucas's _One Day with
17424,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,Another_. It is here given by permission of Mr. Wilfrid Meynell and of

17428,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"are taken, by permission of Messrs. MacLehose and Sons, from _The"
17429,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Scarlet Gown_, 1891, the parodies in which, according to Andrew Lang,"
17430,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,are not inferior to Calverley. 'Andrew M'Crie' is an improved edition
17431,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,of the verses originally contributed to the _University News-Sheet_
17432,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"(St. Andrews) in 1886, entitled 'Albert McGee.'"
17433,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,

17437,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"P. 387. _Fish have their times to bite._ This parody of Mrs. Hemans, by"
17438,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"an unknown author, is taken from _College Rhymes_, 1861. The original"
17439,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,begins:
17440,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17441,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"Leaves have their time to fall,"
17442,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,"And flowers to wither at the north-wind's breath,"

17445,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,
17446,THOMAS INGOLDSBY.,P. 390. _A Girtonian Funeral._ This parody of 'A Grammarian's Funeral'

18127,[5] WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,
18128,[5] WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,[7] This alludes to the young Betty mania. The writer was in the
18129,[5] WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,stage-box at the height of this young gentleman's popularity. One of
18130,[5] WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"the other occupants offered, in a loud voice, to prove that young"
18131,[5] WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,Betty did not understand Shakespeare. 'Silence!' was the cry; but he
18132,[5] WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,still proceeded. 'Turn him out!' was the next ejaculation. He still
18133,[5] WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,vociferated 'He does not understand Shakespeare;' and was consequently
18134,[5] WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"shouldered into the lobby. 'I'll prove it to you,' said the critic"
18135,[5] WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"to the door-keeper. 'Prove what, sir?' 'That he does not understand"

18148,[9] LORD BYRON.,"noble bard having afterwards returned to England, and again quitted it,"
18149,[9] LORD BYRON.,under domestic circumstances painfully notorious. His good-humoured
18150,[9] LORD BYRON.,forgiveness of the Authors has been already alluded to in the Preface.
18151,[9] LORD BYRON.,"Nothing of this illustrious poet, however trivial, can be otherwise"
18152,[9] LORD BYRON.,than interesting. 'We knew him well.' At Mr. Murray's dinner-table the
18153,[9] LORD BYRON.,annotator met him and Sir John Malcolm. Lord Byron talked of intending
18154,[9] LORD BYRON.,to travel in Persia. 'What must I do when I set off?' said he to Sir
18155,[9] LORD BYRON.,"John. 'Cut off your buttons!' 'My buttons! what, these metal ones?'"
18156,[9] LORD BYRON.,'Yes; the Persians are in the main very honest fellows; but if you go
18157,[9] LORD BYRON.,"thus bedizened, you will infallibly be murdered for your buttons.' At"
18158,[9] LORD BYRON.,"a dinner at Monk Lewis's chambers in the Albany, Lord Byron expressed"
18159,[9] LORD BYRON.,"to the writer his determination not to go there again, adding, 'I never"
18160,[9] LORD BYRON.,will dine with a middle-aged man who fills up his table with young
18161,[9] LORD BYRON.,"ensigns, and has looking-glass panels to his book-cases.' Lord Byron,"
18162,[9] LORD BYRON.,"when one of the Drury Lane Committee of Management, challenged the"
18163,[9] LORD BYRON.,writer to sing alternately (like the swains in Virgil) the praises of
18164,[9] LORD BYRON.,"Mrs. Mardyn, the actress, who, by the by, was hissed off the stage for"
18165,[9] LORD BYRON.,"an imputed intimacy, of which she was quite innocent."
18166,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18167,[9] LORD BYRON.,The contest ran as follows:
18168,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18169,[9] LORD BYRON.,"'Wake, muse of fire, your ardent lyre,"
18170,[9] LORD BYRON.,"Pour forth your amorous ditty,"
18171,[9] LORD BYRON.,"But first profound, in duty bound,"
18172,[9] LORD BYRON.,Applaud the new committee;
18173,[9] LORD BYRON.,Their scenic art from Thespis cart
18174,[9] LORD BYRON.,"All jaded nags discarding,"
18175,[9] LORD BYRON.,"To London drove this queen of love,"
18176,[9] LORD BYRON.,Enchanting Mrs. Mardyn.
18177,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18178,[9] LORD BYRON.,"'Though tides of love around her rove,"
18179,[9] LORD BYRON.,I fear she'll choose Pactolus--
18180,[9] LORD BYRON.,"In that bright surge bards ne'er immerge,"
18181,[9] LORD BYRON.,So I must e'en swim solus.

18185,[9] LORD BYRON.,From eye of Mrs. Mardyn!'
18186,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18187,[9] LORD BYRON.,"And so on. The reader has, no doubt, already discovered 'which is the"
18188,[9] LORD BYRON.,"justice, and which is the thief.'"
18189,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18190,[9] LORD BYRON.,"Lord Byron at that time wore a very narrow cravat of white sarsnet,"
18191,[9] LORD BYRON.,"with the shirt-collar falling over it; a black coat and waistcoat,"
18192,[9] LORD BYRON.,"and very broad white trousers, to hide his lame foot--these were of"
18193,[9] LORD BYRON.,"Russia duck in the morning, and jean in the evening. His watch-chain"
18194,[9] LORD BYRON.,"had a number of small gold seals appended to it, and was looped up to"
18195,[9] LORD BYRON.,a button of his waistcoat. His face was void of colour; he wore no
18196,[9] LORD BYRON.,"whiskers. His eyes were grey, fringed with long black lashes; and his"
18197,[9] LORD BYRON.,"air was imposing, but rather supercilious. He undervalued David Hume;"
18198,[9] LORD BYRON.,"denying his claim to genius on account of his bulk, and calling him,"
18199,[9] LORD BYRON.,"from the heroic epistle,"
18200,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18201,[9] LORD BYRON.,'The fattest hog in Epicurus' sty.'
18202,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18203,[9] LORD BYRON.,"One of this extraordinary man's allegations was, that 'fat is an oily"
18204,[9] LORD BYRON.,"dropsy.' To stave off its visitation, he frequently chewed tobacco in"
18205,[9] LORD BYRON.,"lieu of dinner, alleging that it absorbed the gastric juice of the"
18206,[9] LORD BYRON.,"stomach, and prevented hunger. 'Pass your hand down my side,' said his"
18207,[9] LORD BYRON.,lordship to the writer; 'can you count my ribs?' 'Every one of them.'
18208,[9] LORD BYRON.,'I am delighted to hear you say so. I called last week on Lady ----;
18209,[9] LORD BYRON.,"""Ah, Lord Byron,"" said she, ""how fat you grow!"" But you know Lady ----"
18210,[9] LORD BYRON.,is fond of saying spiteful things!' Let this gossip be summed up with
18211,[9] LORD BYRON.,"the words of Lord Chesterfield, in his character of Bolingbroke: 'Upon"
18212,[9] LORD BYRON.,"the whole, on a survey of this extraordinary character, what can we say"
18213,[9] LORD BYRON.,"but ""Alas, poor human nature!""'"
18214,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18215,[9] LORD BYRON.,His favourite Pope's description of man is applicable to Byron

18219,[9] LORD BYRON.,Still by himself abused or disabused;

18225,[9] LORD BYRON.,The writer never heard him allude to his deformed foot except upon one

18227,[9] LORD BYRON.,"Byron alone, the younger Byrne and Miss Smith the dancer having just"
18228,[9] LORD BYRON.,"left him, after an angry conference about a _pas seul_. 'Had you been"
18229,[9] LORD BYRON.,"here a minute sooner,' said Lord B., 'you would have heard a question"
18230,[9] LORD BYRON.,about dancing referred to me;--me! (looking mournfully downward) whom
18231,[9] LORD BYRON.,fate from my birth has prohibited from taking a single step.'
18232,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18233,[9] LORD BYRON.,[11] 'Holland's edifice.' The late theatre was built by Holland the
18234,[9] LORD BYRON.,architect. The writer visited it on the night of its opening. The
18235,[9] LORD BYRON.,performances were _Macbeth_ and the _Virgin Unmasked_. Between the
18236,[9] LORD BYRON.,"play and the farce, an excellent epilogue, written by George Colman,"
18237,[9] LORD BYRON.,was excellently spoken by Miss Farren. It referred to the iron curtain
18238,[9] LORD BYRON.,"which was, in the event of fire, to be let down between the stage and"
18239,[9] LORD BYRON.,"the audience, and which accordingly descended, by way of experiment,"
18240,[9] LORD BYRON.,leaving Miss Farren between the lamps and the curtain. The fair
18241,[9] LORD BYRON.,"speaker informed the audience, that should the fire break out on the"
18242,[9] LORD BYRON.,"stage (where it usually originates), it would thus be kept from the"
18243,[9] LORD BYRON.,"spectators; adding, with great solemnity--"
18244,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18245,[9] LORD BYRON.,'No! we assure our generous benefactors
18246,[9] LORD BYRON.,'Twill only burn the scenery and the actors!'
18247,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18248,[9] LORD BYRON.,"A tank of water was afterwards exhibited, in the course of the"
18249,[9] LORD BYRON.,"epilogue, in which a wherry was rowed by a real live man, the band"
18250,[9] LORD BYRON.,playing--
18251,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18252,[9] LORD BYRON.,'And did you not hear of a jolly young waterman?'

18258,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18259,[9] LORD BYRON.,'O vain thought!' as Othello says. Notwithstanding the boast in the
18260,[9] LORD BYRON.,epilogue--

18262,[9] LORD BYRON.,"'Blow, wind--come, wrack, in ages yet unborn,"

18264,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18265,[9] LORD BYRON.,the theatre fell a victim to the flames within fifteen years from the
18266,[9] LORD BYRON.,prognostic! These preparations against fire always presuppose presence
18267,[9] LORD BYRON.,of mind and promptness in those who are to put them into action. They
18268,[9] LORD BYRON.,"remind one of the dialogue, in Morton's _Speed the Plough_, between Sir"
18269,[9] LORD BYRON.,Abel Handy and his son Bob:
18270,[9] LORD BYRON.,
18271,[9] LORD BYRON.,"'_Bob._ Zounds, the castle's on fire!"

18343,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,roof. The writer (_horrescit referens!_) is old enough to recollect
18344,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"the time when it was first placed there. Old Bishop, then one of"
18345,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"the masters of Merchant Tailors' School, wrote an epigram upon the"
18346,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"occasion, which, referring to the aforesaid figure, concluded thus:"

18349,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,And Shakespeare fills up his below'--

18351,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Very antithetical: but quære as to the meaning? The writer, like Pluto,"
18352,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"'long puzzled his brain' to find it out, till he was immersed 'in a"
18353,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"lower deep' by hearing Madame de Staël say, at the table of the late"
18354,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Lord Dillon, 'Buonaparte is not a man, but a system.' Inquiry was made"
18355,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,in the course of the evening of Sir James Mackintosh as to what the
18356,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"lady meant. He answered, 'Mass! I cannot tell.' Madame de Staël repeats"
18357,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,this apophthegm in her work on Germany. It is probably understood
18358,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,_there_.

18360,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"[27] O. P. This personage, who is alleged to have growled like a"
18361,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"bull-dog, requires rather a lengthened note, for the edification of"
18362,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"the rising generation. The 'horns, rattles, drums,' with which he is"
18363,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"accompanied, are no inventions of the poet. The new Covent Garden"
18364,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Theatre opened on the 18th Sept., 1809, when a cry of 'Old Prices'"
18365,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,(afterwards diminished to O. P.) burst out from every part of the
18366,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"house. This continued and increased in violence till the 23rd, when"
18367,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"rattles, drums, whistles, and cat-calls, having completely drowned"
18368,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"the voices of the actors, Mr. Kemble, the stage-manager, came forward"
18369,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"and said, that a committee of gentlemen had undertaken to examine the"
18370,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"finances of the concern, and that until they were prepared with their"
18371,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,report the theatre would continue closed. 'Name them!' was shouted
18372,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"from all sides. The names were declared, viz. Sir Charles Price, the"
18373,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Solicitor-General, the Recorder of London, the Governor of the Bank,"
18374,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,and Mr. Angersteen. 'All shareholders!' bawled a wag from the gallery.
18375,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,In a few days the theatre re-opened: the public paid no attention to
18376,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"the report of the referees, and the tumult was renewed for several"
18377,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,weeks with even increased violence. The proprietors now sent in hired
18378,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"bruisers, to _mill_ the refractory into subjection. This irritated most"
18379,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"of their former friends, and, amongst the rest, the annotator, who"
18380,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"accordingly wrote the song of 'Heigh-ho, says Kemble,' which was caught"
18381,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"up by the ballad-singers, and sung under Mr. Kemble's house-windows"
18382,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,in Great Russell Street. A dinner was given at the Crown and Anchor
18383,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Tavern in the Strand, to celebrate the victory obtained by W. Clifford"
18384,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"in his action against Brandon the box-keeper, for assaulting him"
18385,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,for wearing the letters O. P. in his hat. At this dinner Mr. Kemble
18386,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"attended, and matters were compromised by allowing the advanced price"
18387,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,(seven shillings) to the boxes. The writer remembers a former riot of a
18388,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"similar sort at the same theatre (in the year 1792), when the price to"
18389,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"the boxes was raised from five shillings to six. That tumult, however,"
18390,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,only lasted three nights.
18391,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
18392,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,[28] 'From the knobb'd bludgeon to the taper switch.' This image is
18393,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,not the creation of the poets: it sprang from reality. The Authors
18394,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,happened to be at the Royal Circus when 'God save the King' was called
18395,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"for, accompanied by a cry of 'Stand up!' and 'Hats off!' An inebriated"
18396,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,naval lieutenant perceiving a gentleman in an adjoining box slow to
18397,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"obey the call, struck his hat off with his stick, exclaiming, 'Take off"
18398,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"your hat, sir!' The other thus assaulted proved to be, unluckily for"
18399,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"the lieutenant, Lord Camelford, the celebrated bruiser and duellist."
18400,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"A set-to in the lobby was the consequence, where his lordship quickly"
18401,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"proved victorious. 'The devil is not so black as he is painted,' said"
18402,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"one of the Authors to the other; 'let us call upon Lord Camelford, and"
18403,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,tell him that we were witnesses of his being first assaulted.' The
18404,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"visit was paid on the ensuing morning at Lord Camelford's lodging, in"
18405,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,Bond Street. Over the fire-place in the drawing-room were ornaments
18406,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,strongly expressive of the pugnacity of the peer. A long thick bludgeon
18407,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,lay horizontally supported by two brass hooks. Above this was placed
18408,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"parallel one of lesser dimensions, until a pyramid of weapons gradually"
18409,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"arose, tapering to a horsewhip:"
18410,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
18411,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"'Thus all below was strength, and all above was grace.'"
18412,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,
18413,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"Lord Camelford received his visitants with great civility, and"
18414,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"thanked them warmly for the call; adding, that their evidence would"
18415,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"be material, it being his intention to indict the lieutenant for an"
18416,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"assault. 'All I can say in return is this,' exclaimed the peer with"
18417,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"great cordiality, 'if ever I see you engaged in a row, upon my soul,"
18418,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,I'll stand by you.' The Authors expressed themselves thankful for so
18419,[22] ROBERT SOUTHEY.,"potent an ally, and departed. In about a fortnight afterwards Lord"

18532,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"many of that fraternity, a disagreeable one--verbose, disputatious, and"
18533,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,paradoxical. His _Monk_ and _Castle Spectre_ elevated him into fame;
18534,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"and he continued to write ghost-stories till, following as he did in"
18535,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"the wake of Mrs. Radcliffe, he quite overstocked the market. Lewis"
18536,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"visited his estates in Jamaica, and came back perfectly negro-bitten."
18537,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"He promulgated a new code of laws in the island, for the government"

18539,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"commits murder shall have his head shaved, and be confined three days"
18540,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"and nights in a dark room.' Upon occasion of printing these parodies,"
18541,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"Monk Lewis said to Lady H., 'Many of them are very fair, but mine is"
18542,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"not at all like; they have made me write burlesque, which I never do.'"
18543,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"'You don't know your own talent,' answered the lady."

18550,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"He had, moreover, large grey eyes, thick features, and an inexpressive"

18552,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"fore-finger of his right hand across his right eyelid. He affected, in"
18553,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"conversation, a sort of dandified, drawling tone; young Harlowe, the"
18554,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"artist, did the same. A foreigner who had but a slight knowledge of"
18555,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"the English language might have concluded, from their cadences, that"
18556,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"they were little better than fools--'just a born goose,' as Terry the"
18557,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"actor used to say. Lewis died on his passage homeward from Jamaica,"
18558,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,owing to a dose of James's powders injudiciously administered by 'his
18559,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"own mere motion.' He wrote various plays, with various success: he had"
18560,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,"an admirable notion of dramatic construction, but the goodness of his"
18561,[40] WILLIAM SPENCER.,scenes and incidents was marred by the badness of his dialogue.

18606,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"second, Bishopsgate Street. The writer attended a lecture given by"

18608,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"the inventor was about to apply to parliament, members of both houses"

18637,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"good-humoured laugh: 'Ah! my old enemy, how do you do?' In the course"
18638,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"of conversation, he expressed great astonishment at his popularity"

18936,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,
18937,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,[106] The reference here and in a subsequent verse is to a song very
18938,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,popular at the time:
18939,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,
18940,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"'All round my hat I vears a green villow,"
18941,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"All round my hat for a twelvemonth and a day,"
18942,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"And if any van should arsk you the reason vy I vears it,"
18943,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"Say, all for my true love that's far, far away."
18944,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,
18945,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"''Twas agoin of my rounds on the streets I first did meet her,"
18946,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"'Twas agoin of my rounds that first she met my heye,"
18947,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"And I never heard a voice more louder nor more sweeter,"
18948,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"As she cried, ""Who'll buy my cabbages, my cabbages who'll buy?""'"
18949,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,
18950,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"There were several more verses, and being set to a very taking air, it"
18951,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,was a reigning favourite with the 'Social Chucksters' of the day. Even
18952,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,scholars thought it worth turning into Latin verse. I remember reading
18953,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"in some short-lived journal a very clever version of it, the first"
18954,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,verse of which ran thus:
18955,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,
18956,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,'Omne circa petusum sertum gero viridem
18957,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,Per annum circa petasum et unum diem plus.
18958,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"Si quis te rogaret, cur tale sertum gererem,"
18959,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"Dic, ""Omne propter coroulum qui est inpartibus.""'"
18960,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,
18961,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"Allusions to the willow, as an emblem of grief, are of a very old date."
18962,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"'Sing all, a green willow must be my garland,' is the refrain of the"
18963,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"song which haunted Desdemona on the eve of her death (_Othello_, Act"
18964,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"IV., Scene 3). That exquisite scene, and the beautiful air to which"
18965,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"some contemporary of Shakespeare wedded it, will make 'The Willow Song'"
18966,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,immortal.
18967,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,
18968,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,[107] Madame Laffarge and Daniel Good were the two most talked about
18969,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,criminals of the time when these lines were written. Madame Laffarge
18970,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"was convicted of poisoning her husband under extenuating circumstances,"
18971,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"and was imprisoned for life, but many believed in her protestations of"
18972,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"innocence--this, of course, she being a woman and unhappily married."
18973,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"Daniel Good died on the scaffold on the 23rd of May, 1842, protesting"
18974,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"his innocence to the last, and asserting that his victim, Jane Sparks,"
18975,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"had killed herself, an assertion which a judge and jury naturally could"
18976,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"not reconcile with the fact that her head, arms, and legs had been cut"
18977,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,"off and hidden with her body in a stable. He, too, found people to"
18978,[45] SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE.,maintain that his sentence was unjust.
