195,ON TIME,"PREFACE by the Rev. H. C. Beeching, M. A."
196,ON TIME,
197,ON TIME,
198,ON TIME,"This edition of Milton's Poetry is a reprint, as careful as Editor and"
199,ON TIME,"Printers have been able to make it, from the earliest printed copies of"
200,ON TIME,the several poems.  First the 1645 volume of the Minor Poems has been
201,ON TIME,printed entire; then follow in order the poems added in the reissue of
202,ON TIME,"1673; the Paradise Lost, from the edition of 1667; and the Paradise"
203,ON TIME,Regain'd and Samson Agonistes from the edition of 1671.
204,ON TIME,
205,ON TIME,The most interesting portion of the book must be reckoned the first
206,ON TIME,"section of it, which reproduces for the first time the scarce small"
207,ON TIME,octavo of 1645.  The only reprint of the Minor Poems in the old
208,ON TIME,"spelling, so far as I know, is the one edited by Mitford, but that"
209,ON TIME,"followed the edition of 1673, which is comparatively uninteresting since"
210,ON TIME,it could not have had Milton's oversight as it passed through the press.
211,ON TIME,"We know that it was set up from a copy of the 1645 edition, because it"
212,ON TIME,reproduces some pointless eccentricities such as the varying form of the
213,ON TIME,chorus to Psalm cxxxvi; but while it corrects the errata tabulated in
214,ON TIME,"that edition it commits many more blunders of its own.  It is valuable,"
215,ON TIME,"however, as the editio princeps of ten of the sonnets and it contains"
216,ON TIME,one important alteration in the Ode on the Nativity. This and all other
217,ON TIME,alterations will be found noted where they occur.  I have not thought it
218,ON TIME,necessary to note mere differences of spelling between the two editions
219,ON TIME,but a word may find place here upon their general character.  Generally
220,ON TIME,"it may be said that, where the two editions differ, the later spelling"
221,ON TIME,"is that now in use.  Thus words like goddess, darkness, usually written"
222,ON TIME,"in the first edition with one final s, have two, while on the  other"
223,ON TIME,"hand words like vernall, youthfull, and monosyllables like hugg, farr,"
224,ON TIME,"lose their double letter.  Many monosyllables, e.g. som, cours, glimps,"
225,ON TIME,"wher, vers, aw, els, don, ey, ly, so written in 1645, take on in 1673 an"
226,ON TIME,"e mute, while words like harpe, windes, onely, lose it. By a reciprocal"
227,ON TIME,"change ayr and cipress become air and cypress; and the vowels in daign,"
228,ON TIME,"vail, neer, beleeve, sheild, boosom, eeven, battail, travailer, and many"
229,ON TIME,other words are similarly modernized.  On the other hand there are a few
230,ON TIME,cases where the 1645 edition exhibits the spelling which has succeeded
231,ON TIME,"in fixing itself, as travail (1673, travel) in the sense of labour; and"
232,ON TIME,"rob'd, profane, human, flood and bloody, forest, triple, alas, huddling,"
233,ON TIME,"are found where the 1673 edition has roab'd, prophane, humane, floud and"
234,ON TIME,"bloudy, forrest, tripple, alass and hudling.  Indeed the spelling in"
235,ON TIME,this later edition is not untouched by seventeenth century
236,ON TIME,"inconsistency.  It retains here and there forms like shameles, cateres,"
237,ON TIME,"(where 1645 reads cateress), and occasionally reverts to the"
238,ON TIME,older-fashioned spelling of monosyllables without the mute e.  In the
239,ON TIME,"Epitaph on the Marchioness of Winchester, it reads--' And som flowers"
240,ON TIME,and some bays.'  But undoubtedly the impression on the whole is of a
241,ON TIME,much more modern text.
242,ON TIME,
243,ON TIME,"In the matter of small or capital letters I have followed the old copy,"
244,ON TIME,except in one or two places where a personification seemed not plainly
245,ON TIME,enough marked to a modern reader without a capital. Thus in Il
246,ON TIME,"Penseroso, l. 49, I print Leasure, although both editions read leasure;"
247,ON TIME,"and in the Vacation Exercise, l. 71, Times for times. Also where the"
248,ON TIME,"employment or omission of a capital is plainly due to misprinting, as"
249,ON TIME,"too frequently in the 1673 edition, I silently make the correction."
250,ON TIME,"Examples are, notes for Notes in Sonnet xvii. l. 13; Anointed for"
251,ON TIME,anointed in Psalm  ii. l.12.
252,ON TIME,
253,ON TIME,In regard to punctuation I have followed the old printers except in
254,ON TIME,"obvious misprints, and followed them also, as far as possible, in their"
255,ON TIME,distribution of roman and italic type and in the grouping of words and
256,ON TIME,"lines in the various titles. To follow them exactly was impossible, as"
257,ON TIME,the  books are so very different in size.
258,ON TIME,
259,ON TIME,At this point the candid reader may perhaps ask what advantage is gained
260,ON TIME,by presenting these poems to modern readers in the dress of a bygone
261,ON TIME,age.  If the question were put to me I should probably evade it by
262,ON TIME,"pointing out that Mr. Frowde is issuing an edition based upon this, in"
263,ON TIME,which the spelling is frankly that of to-day.  But if the question were
264,ON TIME,"pressed, I think a sufficient answer might be found.  To begin with, I"
265,ON TIME,"should point out that even Prof. Masson, who in his excellent edition"
266,ON TIME,"argues the point and decides in favour of modern spelling, allows that"
267,ON TIME,there are peculiarities of Milton's spelling which are really
268,ON TIME,"significant, and ought therefore to be noted or preserved.  But who is"
269,ON TIME,to determine exactly which words are spelt according to the poet's own
270,ON TIME,"instructions, and which according to the printer's whim?  It is"
271,ON TIME,notorious that in Paradise Lost some words were spelt upon a deliberate
272,ON TIME,"system, and it may very well happen that in the volume of minor poems"
273,ON TIME,"which the poet saw through the press in 1645, there were spellings no"
274,ON TIME,less systematic.  Prof. Masson makes a great point of the fact that
275,ON TIME,"Milton's own spelling, exhibited in the autograph manuscript of some of"
276,ON TIME,"the minor poems preserved in Trinity College, Cambridge, does not"
277,ON TIME,"correspond with that of the printed copy. [Note: This manuscript,"
278,ON TIME,"invaluable to all students of Milton, has lately been facsimiled under"
279,ON TIME,"the superintendence of Dr. Aldis Wright, and published at the Cambridge"
280,ON TIME,"University press].  This is certainly true, as the reader may see for"
281,ON TIME,himself by comparing the passage from the manuscript given in the
282,ON TIME,appendix with the corresponding place in the text.  Milton's own
283,ON TIME,"spelling revels in redundant e's, while the printer of the 1645 book is"
284,ON TIME,very sparing of them.  But in cases where the spelling affects the
285,ON TIME,"metre, we find that the printed text and Milton's manuscript closely"
286,ON TIME,"correspond; and it is upon its value in determining the metre, quite as"
287,ON TIME,"much as its antiquarian interest, that I should base a justification of"
288,ON TIME,"this reprint.  Take, for instance, such a line as the eleventh of Comus,"
289,ON TIME,which Prof. Masson gives as:--
290,ON TIME,
291,ON TIME,Amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats.
292,ON TIME,
293,ON TIME,A reader not learned in Miltonic rhythms will certainly read this
294,ON TIME,
295,ON TIME,Amongst th' enthroned gods
296,ON TIME,
297,ON TIME,But the 1645 edition reads:
298,ON TIME,
299,ON TIME,Amongst the enthron'd gods
300,ON TIME,
301,ON TIME,"and so does Milton's manuscript.  Again, in line 597, Prof."
302,ON TIME,Masson reads:
303,ON TIME,
304,ON TIME,It shall be in eternal restless change
305,ON TIME,"Self-fed and self-consumed.  If this fail,"
306,ON TIME,"The pillared firmament is rottenness,  &c."
307,ON TIME,
308,ON TIME,But the 1645 text and Milton's manuscript read self-consum'd; after
309,ON TIME,which word there is to be understood a metrical pause to mark the
310,ON TIME,violent transition of the thought.
311,ON TIME,
312,ON TIME,Again in the second line of the Sonnet to a Nightingale Prof. Masson
313,ON TIME,has:
314,ON TIME,
315,ON TIME,Warblest at eve when all the woods are still
316,ON TIME,
317,ON TIME,"but the early edition, which probably follows Milton's spelling though"
318,ON TIME,"in this case we have no manuscript to compare, reads 'Warbl'st.' So the"
319,ON TIME,"original text of Samson, l. 670, has 'temper'st.'"
320,ON TIME,
321,ON TIME,"The retention of the old system of punctuation may be less defensible,"
322,ON TIME,but I have retained it because it may now and then be of use in
323,ON TIME,"determining a point of syntax.  The absence of a comma, for example,"
324,ON TIME,after the word hearse in the 58th line of the Epitaph on the Marchioness
325,ON TIME,"of Winchester, printed by Prof. Masson thus:--"
326,ON TIME,
327,ON TIME,"And some flowers, and some bays"
328,ON TIME,"For thy hearse to strew thy ways,"
329,ON TIME,
330,ON TIME,but in the 1645 edition:--
331,ON TIME,
332,ON TIME,"And som Flowers, and som Bays,"
333,ON TIME,"For thy Hears to strew the ways,"
334,ON TIME,
335,ON TIME,goes to prove that for here must be taken as 'fore.
336,ON TIME,
337,ON TIME,Of the Paradise Lost there were two editions issued during Milton's
338,ON TIME,"lifetime, and while the first has been taken as our text, all the"
339,ON TIME,"variants in the second, not being simple misprints, have been recorded"
340,ON TIME,"in the notes.  In one respect, however, in the distribution of the poem"
341,ON TIME,"into twelve books instead of ten, it has seemed best, for the sake of"
342,ON TIME,"practical convenience, to follow the second edition.  A word may be"
343,ON TIME,allowed here on the famous correction among the Errata prefixed to the
344,ON TIME,"first edition:  'Lib. 2. v. 414, for we read wee.'  This correction"
345,ON TIME,"shows not only that Milton had theories about spelling, but also that he"
346,ON TIME,"found means, though his sight was gone, to ascertain whether his rules"
347,ON TIME,had been carried out by his printer; and in itself this fact justifies a
348,ON TIME,facsimile reprint.  What the principle in the use of the double vowel
349,ON TIME,exactly was (and it is found to affect the other monosyllabic pronouns)
350,ON TIME,"it is not so easy to discover, though roughly it is clear the"
351,ON TIME,"reduplication was intended to mark emphasis.  For example, in the speech"
352,ON TIME,of the Divine Son after the battle in heaven (vi. 810-817) the pronouns
353,ON TIME,which the voice would naturally emphasize are spelt with the double
354,ON TIME,vowel:
355,ON TIME,
356,ON TIME,Stand onely and behold
357,ON TIME,Gods indignation on these Godless pourd
358,ON TIME,"By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd,"
359,ON TIME,"Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,"
360,ON TIME,"Because the Father, t'whom in Heav'n supream"
361,ON TIME,"Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,"
362,ON TIME,Hath honourd me according to his will.
363,ON TIME,Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assign'd.
364,ON TIME,
365,ON TIME,In the Son's speech offering himself as Redeemer (iii. 227-249) where
366,ON TIME,"the pronoun all through is markedly emphasized, it is printed mee the"
367,ON TIME,"first four times, and afterwards me; but it is noticeable that these"
368,ON TIME,first four times the emphatic word does not stand in the stressed place
369,ON TIME,"of the verse, so that a careless reader might not emphasize it, unless"
370,ON TIME,his attention were specially led by some such sign:
371,ON TIME,
372,ON TIME,"Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life"
373,ON TIME,"I offer, on mee let thine anger fall;"
374,ON TIME,Account mee man.
375,ON TIME,
376,ON TIME,"In the Hymn of Creation (v.160-209) where ye occurs fourteen times, the"
377,ON TIME,"emphasis and the metric stress six times out of seven coincide, and the"
378,ON TIME,"pronoun is spelt yee; where it is unemphatic, and in an unstressed"
379,ON TIME,"place, it is spelt ye. Two lines are especially instructive:"
380,ON TIME,
381,ON TIME,"Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light (l. 160);"
382,ON TIME,
383,ON TIME,and
384,ON TIME,
385,ON TIME,"Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,"
386,ON TIME,"Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise (l. 195)."
387,ON TIME,
388,ON TIME,"In v. 694 it marks, as the voice by its emphasis would mark in"
389,ON TIME,"reading, a change of subject:"
390,ON TIME,
391,ON TIME,"So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd"
392,ON TIME,Bad influence into th' unwarie brest
393,ON TIME,"Of his Associate; hee (i. e. the associate) together calls,"
394,ON TIME,&c.
395,ON TIME,
396,ON TIME,"An examination of other passages, where there is no antithesis, goes to"
397,ON TIME,show that the lengthened form of the pronoun is most frequent before a
398,ON TIME,"pause (as vii. 95); or at the end of a line (i. 245, 257); or when a"
399,ON TIME,foot is inverted (v. 133); or when as object it  precedes its verb (v.
400,ON TIME,"612; vii. 747), or as subject follows it (ix. 1109; x. 4).  But as we"
401,ON TIME,might expect under circumstances where a purist could not correct his
402,ON TIME,"own proofs, there are not a few inconsistencies.  There does not seem,"
403,ON TIME,"for example, any special emphasis in the second wee of the following"
404,ON TIME,passage:
405,ON TIME,
406,ON TIME,Freely we serve.
407,ON TIME,"Because wee freely love, as in our will"
408,ON TIME,To love or not; in this we stand or fall  (v. 538).
409,ON TIME,
410,ON TIME,
411,ON TIME,"On the other hand, in the passage (iii. 41) in which the poet"
412,ON TIME,speaks of his own blindness:
413,ON TIME,
414,ON TIME,Thus with the Year
415,ON TIME,"Seasons return, but not to me returns"
416,ON TIME,"Day, &c."
417,ON TIME,
418,ON TIME,"where, if anywhere, we should expect mee, we do not find it, though it"
419,ON TIME,occurs in the speech eight lines below.  It should be added that this
420,ON TIME,differentiation of the pronouns is not found in any printed poem of
421,ON TIME,"Milton's before Paradise Lost, nor is it found in the Cambridge"
422,ON TIME,"autograph. In that manuscript the constant forms are me, wee, yee."
423,ON TIME,"There is one place where there is a difference in the spelling of she,"
424,ON TIME,and it is just possible that this may not be due to accident.  In the
425,ON TIME,"first verse of the song in Arcades, the MS. reads:"
426,ON TIME,
427,ON TIME,"This, this is shee;"
428,ON TIME,
429,ON TIME,and in the third verse:
430,ON TIME,
431,ON TIME,"This, this is she alone."
432,ON TIME,
433,ON TIME,This use of the double vowel is found a few times in Paradise Regain'd:
434,ON TIME,"in ii. 259 and iv. 486, 497 where mee begins a line, and in iv. 638"
435,ON TIME,where hee is specially emphatic in the concluding lines of the poem.  In
436,ON TIME,"Samson Agonistes it is more frequent (e.g. lines 124, 178, 193, 220,"
437,ON TIME,"252, 290, 1125).  Another word the spelling of which in Paradise Lost"
438,ON TIME,"will be observed to vary is the pronoun their, which is spelt sometimes"
439,ON TIME,"thir.  The spelling in the Cambridge manuscript is uniformly thire,"
440,ON TIME,except once when it is thir; and where their once occurs in the writing
441,ON TIME,of an amanuensis the e is struck through.  That the difference is not
442,ON TIME,merely a printer's device to accommodate his line may be seen by a
443,ON TIME,"comparison of lines 358 and 363 in the First Book, where the shorter"
444,ON TIME,word  comes in the shorter line.  It is probable that the lighter form
445,ON TIME,of the word was intended to be used when it was quite unemphatic.
446,ON TIME,"Contrast, for example, in Book iii. l.59: His own works and their works"
447,ON TIME,at once to view with line 113: Thir maker and thir making and thir Fate.
448,ON TIME,"But the use is not consistent, and the form thir is not found at all"
449,ON TIME,till the 349th line of the First Book.  The distinction is kept up in
450,ON TIME,"the Paradise Regain'd and Samson Agonistes, but, if possible, with even"
451,ON TIME,"less consistency.  Such passages, however, as Paradise Regain'd, iii."
452,ON TIME,"414-440; Samson Agonistes, 880-890, are certainly spelt upon a method,"
453,ON TIME,and it is noticeable that in the choruses the lighter form is universal.
454,ON TIME,
455,ON TIME,"Paradise Regain'd and Samson Agonistes were published in 1671, and no"
456,ON TIME,further edition was called for in the remaining three years of the
457,ON TIME,"poet's lifetime, so that in the case of these poems there are no new"
458,ON TIME,"readings to record; and the texts were so carefully revised, that only"
459,ON TIME,"one fault (Paradise Regain'd, ii. 309) was left for correction later."
460,ON TIME,In these and the other poems I have corrected the misprints catalogued
461,ON TIME,"in the tables of Errata, and I have silently corrected any other unless"
462,ON TIME,"it might be mistaken for a various reading, when I have called attention"
463,ON TIME,to it in a note.  Thus I have not recorded such blunders as Lethian for
464,ON TIME,"Lesbian in the 1645 text of Lycidas, line 63; or hallow for hollow in"
465,ON TIME,"Paradise Lost, vi. 484; but I have noted content for concent, in At a"
466,ON TIME,"Solemn Musick, line 6."
467,ON TIME,
468,ON TIME,In conclusion I have to offer my sincere thanks to all who have
469,ON TIME,collaborated with me in preparing this Edition; to the Delegates of the
470,ON TIME,Oxford Press for allowing me to undertake it and decorate it with so
471,ON TIME,many facsimiles; to the Controller of the Press for his unfailing
472,ON TIME,courtesy; to the printers and printer's reader for their care and pains.
473,ON TIME,Coming nearer home I cannot but acknowledge the help I have received in
474,ON TIME,"looking over proof-sheets from my sister, Mrs. P. A. Barnett, who has"
475,ON TIME,ungrudgingly put at the service of this book both time and eyesight.  In
476,ON TIME,"taking leave of it, I may be permitted to say that it has cost more of"
477,ON TIME,both these inestimable treasures than I had anticipated.  The last proof
478,ON TIME,"reaches me just a year after the first, and the progress of the work has"
479,ON TIME,not in the interval been interrupted. In tenui labor et tenuis gloria.
480,ON TIME,Nevertheless I cannot be sorry it was undertaken.

4672,PSAL. LXXXI.,12  Then did I leave them to their will
4673,PSAL. LXXXI.,And to their wandring mind;                                      50
4674,PSAL. LXXXI.,Their own conceits they follow'd still

17151,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Lawful desires of Nature, not beyond;                               230"
17152,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And now I know he hungers where no food

17156,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"He ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim;"
17157,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band
17158,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Of Spirits likest to himself in guile
17159,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"To be at hand, and at his beck appear,"
17160,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,If cause were to unfold some active Scene

17162,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Then to the Desert takes with these his flight;
17163,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Where still from shade to shade the Son of God

17171,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Or God support Nature without repast                                250
17172,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Though needing, what praise is it to endure?"
17173,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"But now I feel I hunger, which declares,"
17174,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Nature hath need of what she asks; yet God
17175,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Can satisfie that need some other way,"
17176,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Though hunger still remain: so it remain

17183,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Under the hospitable covert nigh
17184,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Of Trees thick interwoven; there he slept,"
17185,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"And dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream,"

17187,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith stood"

17190,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought:"
17191,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,He saw the Prophet also how he fled                                 270
17192,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Into the Desert, and how there he slept"
17193,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Under a Juniper; then how awakt,"
17194,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"He found his Supper on the coals prepar'd,"
17195,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"And by the Angel was bid rise and eat,"
17196,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"And eat the second time after repose,"
17197,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,The strength whereof suffic'd him forty days;
17198,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Sometimes that with Elijah he partook,"
17199,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse.
17200,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark"
17201,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry                        280"
17202,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"The morns approach, and greet her with his Song:"
17203,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose
17204,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream,"
17205,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd."
17206,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd,"

17210,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove,"
17211,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud;                       290
17212,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Thither he bent his way, determin'd there"

17216,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Natures own work it seem'd (Nature taught Art)
17217,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And to a Superstitious eye the haunt
17218,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it round,"
17219,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"When suddenly a man before him stood,"
17220,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad,"
17221,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred,                           300"
17222,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And with fair speech these words to him address'd.
17223,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"With granted leave officious I return,"
17224,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,But much more wonder that the Son of God
17225,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,In this wild solitude so long should bide
17226,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Of all things destitute, and well I know,"
17227,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Not without hunger.  Others of some note,"

17235,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Twice by a voice inviting him to eat.
17236,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Of thee these forty days none hath regard,"
17237,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Forty and more deserted here indeed.
17238,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,To whom thus Jesus; what conclud'st thou hence?
17239,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"They all had need, I as thou seest have none."
17240,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"How hast thou hunger then?  Satan reply'd,"

17242,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Would'st thou not eat?  Thereafter as I like
17243,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"The giver, answer'd Jesus. Why should that"
17244,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend,"
17245,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Hast thou not right to all Created things,"

17254,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Troubl'd that thou should'st hunger, hath purvey'd"

17257,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"With honour, only deign to sit and eat."
17258,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"He spake no dream, for as his words had end,"
17259,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld
17260,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,In ample space under the broadest shade
17261,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"A Table richly spred, in regal mode,                                340"

17269,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Alas how simple, to these Cates compar'd,"
17270,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve!
17271,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And at a stately side-board by the wine                             350
17272,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"That fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood"
17273,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew"

17282,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore,"
17283,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard
17284,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds"
17285,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fann'd
17286,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"From their soft wings, and flora's earliest smells."
17287,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter now"
17288,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,His invitation earnestly renew'd.
17289,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?
17290,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"These are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict"
17291,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Defends the touching of these viands pure,                          370"

17298,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,What doubt'st thou Son of God? sit down and eat.
17299,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,To whom thus Jesus temperately reply'd:
17300,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Said'st thou not that to all things I had right?
17301,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And who withholds my pow'r that right to use?                       380
17302,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Shall I receive by gift what of my own,"
17303,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"When and where likes me best, I can command?"
17304,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou,"
17305,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Command a Table in this Wilderness,"
17306,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And call swift flights of Angels ministrant
17307,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Array'd in Glory on my cup to attend:
17308,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence,"
17309,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"In vain, where no acceptance it can find,"
17310,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And with my hunger what hast thou to do?
17311,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn,                                   390"
17312,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles.
17313,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,To whom thus answer'd Satan malecontent:
17314,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"That I have also power to give thou seest,"
17315,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,If of that pow'r I bring thee voluntary
17316,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,What I might have bestow'd on whom I pleas'd.
17317,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And rather opportunely in this place
17318,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Chose to impart to thy apparent need,"
17319,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I see
17320,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,What I can do or offer is suspect;
17321,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Of these things others quickly will dispose                         400
17322,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil.  With that
17323,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Both Table and Provision vanish'd quite
17324,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard;"
17325,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Only the importune Tempter still remain'd,"
17326,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And with these words his temptation pursu'd.

17353,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,To whom thus Jesus patiently reply'd;
17354,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Yet Wealth without these three is impotent,"
17355,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,To gain dominion or to keep it gain'd.
17356,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Witness those antient Empires of the Earth,"
17357,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd:
17358,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,But men endu'd with these have oft attain'd
17359,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,In lowest poverty to highest deeds;
17360,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd lad,"
17361,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat                          440
17362,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"So many Ages, and shall yet regain"

17367,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus?"
17368,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,For I esteem those names of men so poor

17370,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Riches though offer'd from the hand of Kings.
17371,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"And what in me seems wanting, but that I                            450"

18297,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Came forth with Pilgrim steps in amice gray;
18298,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Who with her radiant finger still'd the roar
18299,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Of thunder, chas'd the clouds, and laid the winds,"

18306,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"After a night of storm so ruinous,"
18307,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Clear'd up their choicest notes in bush and spray
18308,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,To gratulate the sweet return of morn;
18309,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn
18310,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Was absent, after all his mischief done,                            440"

18321,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Fair morning yet betides thee Son of God,"
18322,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,After a dismal night; I heard the rack

18324,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them"
18325,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"As dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven,"

18327,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Are to the main as inconsiderable,"
18328,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"And harmless, if not wholsom, as a sneeze"
18329,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"To mans less universe, and soon are gone;"
18330,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Yet as being oft times noxious where they light                     460
18331,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"On man, beast, plant, wastful and turbulent,"
18332,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Like turbulencies in the affairs of men,"

18368,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"And toil'st in vain, nor me in vain molest."
18369,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage reply'd:
18370,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Then hear, O Son of David, Virgin-born;                             500"
18371,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"For Son of God to me is yet in doubt,"

18375,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"And of the Angelic Song in Bethlehem field,"
18376,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born."
18377,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,From that time seldom have I ceas'd to eye

18379,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred;"
18380,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Till at the Ford of Jordan whither all                              510
18381,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Flock'd to the Baptist, I among the rest,"
18382,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Though not to be Baptiz'd, by voice from Heav'n"
18383,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Heard thee pronounc'd the Son of God belov'd.
18384,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view

18386,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,In what degree or meaning thou art call'd
18387,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"The Son of God, which bears no single sence;"
18388,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"The Son of God I also am, or was,"

18414,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Till underneath them fair Jerusalem,"
18415,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"The holy City lifted high her Towers,"

18419,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,There on the highest Pinacle he set
18420,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,The Son of God; and added thus in scorn:                            550
18421,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright"
18422,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Will ask thee skill; I to thy Fathers house

18431,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Tempt not the Lord thy God, he said and stood."
18432,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,But Satan smitten with amazement fell
18433,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,As when Earths Son Antaeus (to compare
18434,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Small things with greatest) in Irassa strove

18437,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joyn'd,"
18438,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Throttl'd at length in the Air, expir'd and fell;"
18439,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"So after many a foil the Tempter proud,"

18441,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Fell whence he stood to see his Victor fall.
18442,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,And as that Theban Monster that propos'd

18449,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Ruin, and desperation, and dismay,"
18450,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.                          580
18451,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,So Satan fell and strait a fiery Globe
18452,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh,"
18453,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Who on their plumy Vans receiv'd him soft
18454,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"From his uneasie station, and upbore"
18455,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,"As on a floating couch through the blithe Air,"
18456,PARADISE REGAIN'D.,Then in a flowry valley set him down

18544,SAMSON AGONISTES,
18545,SAMSON AGONISTES,
18546,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call'd Tragedy.
18547,SAMSON AGONISTES,
18548,SAMSON AGONISTES,
18549,SAMSON AGONISTES,"TRAGEDY, as it was antiently compos'd, hath been ever held the gravest,"
18550,SAMSON AGONISTES,"moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems: therefore said by"
18551,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear, or terror, to purge"
18552,SAMSON AGONISTES,"the mind of those and such like passions, that is to temper and reduce"
18553,SAMSON AGONISTES,"them to just measure with a kind of delight, stirr'd up by reading or"
18554,SAMSON AGONISTES,seeing those passions well imitated. Nor is Nature wanting in her own
18555,SAMSON AGONISTES,effects to make good his assertion: for so in Physic things of
18556,SAMSON AGONISTES,"melancholic hue and quality are us'd against melancholy, sowr against"
18557,SAMSON AGONISTES,"sowr, salt to remove salt humours. Hence Philosophers and other gravest"
18558,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Writers, as Cicero, Plutarch and others, frequently cite out of Tragic"
18559,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Poets, both to adorn and illustrate thir discourse.  The Apostle Paul"
18560,SAMSON AGONISTES,himself thought it not unworthy to insert a verse of Euripides into the
18561,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Text of Holy Scripture, I Cor. 15. 33. and Paraeus commenting on the"
18562,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Revelation, divides the whole Book as a Tragedy, into Acts distinguisht"
18563,SAMSON AGONISTES,each by a Chorus of Heavenly Harpings and Song between.  Heretofore Men
18564,SAMSON AGONISTES,in highest dignity have labour'd not a little to be thought able to
18565,SAMSON AGONISTES,compose a Tragedy.  Of that honour Dionysius the elder was no less
18566,SAMSON AGONISTES,"ambitious, then before of his attaining to the Tyranny. Augustus Caesar"
18567,SAMSON AGONISTES,"also had begun his Ajax, but unable to please his own judgment with what"
18568,SAMSON AGONISTES,"he had begun, left it unfinisht.  Seneca the Philosopher is by some"
18569,SAMSON AGONISTES,thought the Author of those Tragedies (at lest the best of them) that go
18570,SAMSON AGONISTES,"under that name.  Gregory Nazianzen a Father of the Church, thought it"
18571,SAMSON AGONISTES,not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a Tragedy which he
18572,SAMSON AGONISTES,"entitl'd, Christ suffering. This is mention'd to vindicate Tragedy from"
18573,SAMSON AGONISTES,"the small esteem, or rather infamy, which in the account of many it"
18574,SAMSON AGONISTES,undergoes at this day with other common Interludes; hap'ning through the
18575,SAMSON AGONISTES,Poets error of intermixing Comic stuff with Tragic sadness and gravity;
18576,SAMSON AGONISTES,"or introducing trivial and vulgar persons, which by all judicious hath"
18577,SAMSON AGONISTES,"bin counted absurd; and brought in without discretion, corruptly to"
18578,SAMSON AGONISTES,"gratifie the people. And though antient Tragedy use no Prologue, yet"
18579,SAMSON AGONISTES,"using sometimes, in case of self defence, or explanation, that which"
18580,SAMSON AGONISTES,Martial calls an Epistle; in behalf of this Tragedy coming forth after
18581,SAMSON AGONISTES,"the antient manner, much different from what among us passes for best,"
18582,SAMSON AGONISTES,thus much before-hand may be Epistl'd; that Chorus is here introduc'd
18583,SAMSON AGONISTES,"after the Greek manner, not antient only but modern, and still in use"
18584,SAMSON AGONISTES,among the Italians. In the modelling therefore of this Poem with good
18585,SAMSON AGONISTES,"reason, the Antients and Italians are rather follow'd, as of much more"
18586,SAMSON AGONISTES,authority and fame. The measure of Verse us'd in the Chorus is of all
18587,SAMSON AGONISTES,"sorts, call'd by the Greeks Monostrophic, or rather Apolelymenon,"
18588,SAMSON AGONISTES,"without regard had to Strophe, Antistrophe or Epod, which were a kind of"
18589,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Stanza's fram'd only for the Music, then us'd with the Chorus that sung;"
18590,SAMSON AGONISTES,"not essential to the Poem, and therefore not material; or being divided"
18591,SAMSON AGONISTES,into Stanza's or Pauses they may be call'd Allaeostropha.  Division into
18592,SAMSON AGONISTES,Act and Scene referring chiefly to the Stage (to which this work never
18593,SAMSON AGONISTES,was intended) is here omitted.
18594,SAMSON AGONISTES,
18595,SAMSON AGONISTES,It suffices if the whole Drama be found not produc't beyond the fift
18596,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Act, of the style and uniformitie, and that commonly call'd the Plot,"
18597,SAMSON AGONISTES,"whether intricate or explicit, which is nothing indeed but such"
18598,SAMSON AGONISTES,"oeconomy, or disposition of the fable as may stand best with"
18599,SAMSON AGONISTES,verisimilitude and decorum; they only will best judge who are not
18600,SAMSON AGONISTES,"unacquainted with Aeschulus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the three Tragic"
18601,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Poets unequall'd yet by any, and the best rule to all who endeavour to"
18602,SAMSON AGONISTES,write Tragedy. The circumscription of time wherein the whole Drama
18603,SAMSON AGONISTES,"begins and ends, is according to antient rule, and best example, within"
18604,SAMSON AGONISTES,the space of 24 hours.

18611,SAMSON AGONISTES,
18612,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Samson made Captive, Blind, and now in the Prison at Gaza, there to"
18613,SAMSON AGONISTES,"labour as in a common work-house, on a Festival day, in the general"
18614,SAMSON AGONISTES,"cessation from labour, comes forth into the open Air, to a place nigh,"
18615,SAMSON AGONISTES,somewhat retir'd there to sit a while and bemoan his condition. Where he
18616,SAMSON AGONISTES,happens at length to be visited by certain friends and equals of his
18617,SAMSON AGONISTES,"tribe, which make the Chorus, who seek to comfort him what they can;"
18618,SAMSON AGONISTES,"then by his old Father Manoa, who endeavours the like, and withal tells"
18619,SAMSON AGONISTES,"him his purpose to procure his liberty by ransom; lastly, that this"
18620,SAMSON AGONISTES,Feast was proclaim'd by the Philistins as a day of Thanksgiving for thir
18621,SAMSON AGONISTES,"deliverance from the hands of Samson, which yet more troubles him."
18622,SAMSON AGONISTES,Manoa then departs to prosecute his endeavour with the Philistian Lords
18623,SAMSON AGONISTES,for Samson's redemption; who in the mean while is visited by other
18624,SAMSON AGONISTES,persons; and lastly by a publick Officer to require coming to the Feast
18625,SAMSON AGONISTES,"before the Lords and People, to play or shew his strength in thir"
18626,SAMSON AGONISTES,"presence; he at first refuses, dismissing the publick officer with"
18627,SAMSON AGONISTES,absolute denyal to come; at length perswaded inwardly that this was from
18628,SAMSON AGONISTES,"God, he yields to go along with him, who came now the second time with"
18629,SAMSON AGONISTES,"great threatnings to fetch him; the Chorus yet remaining on the place,"
18630,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Manoa returns full of joyful hope, to procure e're long his Sons"
18631,SAMSON AGONISTES,deliverance: in the midst of which discourse an Ebrew comes in haste
18632,SAMSON AGONISTES,confusedly at first; and afterward more distinctly relating the
18633,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Catastrophe, what Samson had done to the Philistins, and by accident to"
18634,SAMSON AGONISTES,himself; wherewith the Tragedy ends.

18652,SAMSON AGONISTES,"For yonder bank hath choice of Sun or shade,"
18653,SAMSON AGONISTES,"There I am wont to sit, when any chance"

18658,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Unwholsom draught: but here I feel amends,"

18660,SAMSON AGONISTES,With day-spring born; here leave me to respire.

18667,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Ease to the body some, none to the mind"
18668,SAMSON AGONISTES,"From restless thoughts, that like a deadly swarm"

18671,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Times past, what once I was, and what am now."
18672,SAMSON AGONISTES,O wherefore was my birth from Heaven foretold
18673,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Twice by an Angel, who at last in sight"
18674,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of both my Parents all in flames ascended
18675,SAMSON AGONISTES,"From off the Altar, where an Off'ring burn'd,"
18676,SAMSON AGONISTES,As in a fiery column charioting
18677,SAMSON AGONISTES,"His Godlike presence, and from some great act"
18678,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or benefit reveal'd to Abraham's race?
18679,SAMSON AGONISTES,Why was my breeding order'd and prescrib'd                           30
18680,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As of a person separate to God,"
18681,SAMSON AGONISTES,Design'd for great exploits; if I must dye
18682,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Betray'd, Captiv'd, and both my Eyes put out,"
18683,SAMSON AGONISTES,Made of my Enemies the scorn and gaze;
18684,SAMSON AGONISTES,To grind in Brazen Fetters under task
18685,SAMSON AGONISTES,With this Heav'n-gifted strength? O glorious strength
18686,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Put to the labour of a Beast, debas't"
18687,SAMSON AGONISTES,Lower then bondslave! Promise was that I
18688,SAMSON AGONISTES,Should Israel from Philistian yoke deliver;
18689,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Ask for this great Deliverer now, and find him                       40"
18690,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Eyeless in Gaza at the Mill with slaves,"
18691,SAMSON AGONISTES,Himself in bonds under Philistian yoke;
18692,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Yet stay, let me not rashly call in doubt"
18693,SAMSON AGONISTES,Divine Prediction; what if all foretold
18694,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Had been fulfilld but through mine own default,"
18695,SAMSON AGONISTES,Whom have I to complain of but my self?
18696,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Who this high gift of strength committed to me,"
18697,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In what part lodg'd, how easily bereft me,"
18698,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Under the Seal of silence could not keep,"
18699,SAMSON AGONISTES,But weakly to a woman must reveal it                                 50
18700,SAMSON AGONISTES,O'recome with importunity and tears.
18701,SAMSON AGONISTES,"O impotence of mind, in body strong!"
18702,SAMSON AGONISTES,But what is strength without a double share
18703,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of wisdom, vast, unwieldy, burdensom,"
18704,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Proudly secure, yet liable to fall"
18705,SAMSON AGONISTES,"By weakest suttleties, not made to rule,"
18706,SAMSON AGONISTES,But to subserve where wisdom bears command.
18707,SAMSON AGONISTES,"God, when he gave me strength, to shew withal"
18708,SAMSON AGONISTES,"How slight the gift was, hung it in my Hair."
18709,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But peace, I must not quarrel with the will                          60"
18710,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of highest dispensation, which herein"
18711,SAMSON AGONISTES,Happ'ly had ends above my reach to know:
18712,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Suffices that to me strength is my bane,"
18713,SAMSON AGONISTES,And proves the sourse of all my miseries;
18714,SAMSON AGONISTES,"So many, and so huge, that each apart"
18715,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Would ask a life to wail, but chief of all,"
18716,SAMSON AGONISTES,"O loss of sight, of thee I most complain!"
18717,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Blind among enemies, O worse then chains,"
18718,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Dungeon, or beggery, or decrepit age!"
18719,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Light the prime work of God to me is extinct,"
18720,SAMSON AGONISTES,And all her various objects of delight
18721,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Annull'd, which might in part my grief have eas'd,"
18722,SAMSON AGONISTES,Inferiour to the vilest now become
18723,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of man or worm; the vilest here excel me,"
18724,SAMSON AGONISTES,"They creep, yet see, I dark in light expos'd"
18725,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To daily fraud, contempt, abuse and wrong,"
18726,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Within doors, or without, still as a fool,"
18727,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In power of others, never in my own;"
18728,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Scarce half I seem to live, dead more then half."
18729,SAMSON AGONISTES,"O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon,                          80"
18730,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Irrecoverably dark, total Eclipse"
18731,SAMSON AGONISTES,Without all hope of day!
18732,SAMSON AGONISTES,"O first created Beam, and thou great Word,"
18733,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Let there be light, and light was over all;"
18734,SAMSON AGONISTES,Why am I thus bereav'd thy prime decree?
18735,SAMSON AGONISTES,The Sun to me is dark
18736,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And silent as the Moon,"
18737,SAMSON AGONISTES,When she deserts the night
18738,SAMSON AGONISTES,Hid in her vacant interlunar cave.
18739,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Since light so necessary is to life,                                 90"
18740,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And almost life itself, if it be true"
18741,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That light is in the Soul,"
18742,SAMSON AGONISTES,She all in every part; why was the sight
18743,SAMSON AGONISTES,To such a tender ball as th' eye confin'd?
18744,SAMSON AGONISTES,"So obvious and so easie to be quench't,"
18745,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And not as feeling through all parts diffus'd,"
18746,SAMSON AGONISTES,That she might look at will through every pore?
18747,SAMSON AGONISTES,Then had I not been thus exil'd from light;
18748,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As in the land of darkness yet in light,"
18749,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To live a life half dead, a living death,                           100"
18750,SAMSON AGONISTES,And buried; but O yet more miserable!
18751,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My self, my Sepulcher, a moving Grave,"
18752,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Buried, yet not exempt"
18753,SAMSON AGONISTES,By priviledge of death and burial
18754,SAMSON AGONISTES,"From worst of other evils, pains and wrongs,"
18755,SAMSON AGONISTES,But made hereby obnoxious more
18756,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To all the miseries of life,"
18757,SAMSON AGONISTES,Life in captivity
18758,SAMSON AGONISTES,Among inhuman foes.
18759,SAMSON AGONISTES,But who are these? for with joint pace I hear                       110
18760,SAMSON AGONISTES,The tread of many feet stearing this way;
18761,SAMSON AGONISTES,Perhaps my enemies who come to stare
18762,SAMSON AGONISTES,"At my affliction, and perhaps to insult,"
18763,SAMSON AGONISTES,Thir daily practice to afflict me more.
18764,SAMSON AGONISTES,

18889,SAMSON AGONISTES,"She was not the prime cause, but I my self,"
18890,SAMSON AGONISTES,Who vanquisht with a peal of words (O weakness!)

19051,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To them who had corrupted her, my Spies,"

19053,SAMSON AGONISTES,"More Faith? who also in her prime of love,"
19054,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Spousal embraces, vitiated with Gold,"
19055,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Though offer'd only, by the sent conceiv'd                          390"
19056,SAMSON AGONISTES,Her spurious first-born; Treason against me?
19057,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thrice she assay'd with flattering prayers and sighs,"
19058,SAMSON AGONISTES,And amorous reproaches to win from me
19059,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My capital secret, in what part my strength"
19060,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Lay stor'd in what part summ'd, that she might know:"
19061,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thrice I deluded her, and turn'd to sport"
19062,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Her importunity, each time perceiving"
19063,SAMSON AGONISTES,"How openly, and with what impudence"
19064,SAMSON AGONISTES,"She purpos'd to betray me, and (which was worse"
19065,SAMSON AGONISTES,Then undissembl'd hate) with what contempt                          400
19066,SAMSON AGONISTES,She sought to make me Traytor to my self;
19067,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Yet the fourth time, when mustring all her wiles,"
19068,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With blandisht parlies, feminine assaults,"
19069,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Tongue-batteries, she surceas'd not day nor night"
19070,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To storm me over-watch't, and wearied out."
19071,SAMSON AGONISTES,"At times when men seek most repose and rest,"
19072,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I yielded, and unlock'd her all my heart,"
19073,SAMSON AGONISTES,Who with a grain of manhood well resolv'd
19074,SAMSON AGONISTES,Might easily have shook off all her snares:
19075,SAMSON AGONISTES,But foul effeminacy held me yok't                                   410
19076,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Her Bond-slave; O indignity, O blot"
19077,SAMSON AGONISTES,To Honour and Religion! servil mind
19078,SAMSON AGONISTES,Rewarded well with servil punishment!

19082,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Unmanly, ignominious, infamous,"
19083,SAMSON AGONISTES,"True slavery, and that blindness worse then this,"
19084,SAMSON AGONISTES,That saw not how degeneratly I serv'd.

19087,SAMSON AGONISTES,Rather approv'd them not; but thou didst plead
19088,SAMSON AGONISTES,Divine impulsion prompting how thou might'st
19089,SAMSON AGONISTES,Find some occasion to infest our Foes.
19090,SAMSON AGONISTES,I state not that; this I am sure; our Foes
19091,SAMSON AGONISTES,Found soon occasion thereby to make thee
19092,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thir Captive, and thir triumph; thou the sooner"
19093,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Temptation found'st, or over-potent charms"
19094,SAMSON AGONISTES,To violate the sacred trust of silence
19095,SAMSON AGONISTES,Deposited within thee; which to have kept

19105,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Them out of thine, who slew'st them many a slain."

19111,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Samson, of all thy sufferings think the heaviest,"
19112,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of all reproach the most with shame that ever
19113,SAMSON AGONISTES,Could have befall'n thee and thy Fathers house.
19114,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19115,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Father, I do acknowledge and confess"
19116,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That I this honour, I this pomp have brought"
19117,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To Dagon, and advanc'd his praises high                             450"
19118,SAMSON AGONISTES,Among the Heathen round; to God have brought
19119,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Dishonour, obloquie, and op't the mouths"
19120,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of Idolists, and Atheists; have brought scandal"

19127,SAMSON AGONISTES,"This only hope relieves me, that the strife                         460"
19128,SAMSON AGONISTES,With me hath end; all the contest is now
19129,SAMSON AGONISTES,"'Twixt God and Dagon; Dagon hath presum'd,"
19130,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Me overthrown, to enter lists with God,"
19131,SAMSON AGONISTES,His Deity comparing and preferring
19132,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Before the God of Abraham. He, be sure,"
19133,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Will not connive, or linger, thus provok'd,"
19134,SAMSON AGONISTES,But will arise and his great name assert:
19135,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Dagon must stoop, and shall e're long receive"
19136,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Such a discomfit, as shall quite despoil him"
19137,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of all these boasted Trophies won on me,                            470"
19138,SAMSON AGONISTES,And with confusion blank his Worshippers.
19139,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19140,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man: With cause this hope relieves thee, and these words"
19141,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I as a Prophecy receive: for God,"
19142,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nothing more certain, will not long defer"
19143,SAMSON AGONISTES,To vindicate the glory of his name

19145,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Endure it, doubtful whether God be Lord,"
19146,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or Dagon.  But for thee what shall be done?
19147,SAMSON AGONISTES,Thou must not in the mean while here forgot
19148,SAMSON AGONISTES,Lie in this miserable loathsom plight                               480
19149,SAMSON AGONISTES,Neglected.  I already have made way
19150,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To some Philistian Lords, with whom to treat"
19151,SAMSON AGONISTES,About thy ransom: well they may by this
19152,SAMSON AGONISTES,Have satisfi'd thir utmost of revenge
19153,SAMSON AGONISTES,"By pains and slaveries, worse then death inflicted"
19154,SAMSON AGONISTES,"On thee, who now no more canst do them harm."
19155,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19156,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Spare that proposal, Father, spare the trouble"
19157,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of that sollicitation; let me here,"
19158,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As I deserve, pay on my punishment;"
19159,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And expiate, if possible, my crime,                                 490"
19160,SAMSON AGONISTES,Shameful garrulity.  To have reveal'd
19161,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Secrets of men, the secrets of a friend,"
19162,SAMSON AGONISTES,"How hainous had the fact been, how deserving"
19163,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Contempt, and scorn of all, to be excluded"
19164,SAMSON AGONISTES,"All friendship, and avoided as a blab,"
19165,SAMSON AGONISTES,The mark of fool set on his front?
19166,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But I Gods counsel have not kept, his holy  secret"
19167,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Presumptuously have publish'd, impiously,"
19168,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Weakly at least, and shamefully: A sin"
19169,SAMSON AGONISTES,That Gentiles in thir Parables condemn                              500
19170,SAMSON AGONISTES,To thir abyss and horrid pains confin'd.
19171,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19172,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man:  Be penitent and for thy fault contrite,"
19173,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But act not in thy own affliction, Son,"

19175,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thou canst avoid, selfpreservation bids;"
19176,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or th' execution leave to high disposal,"
19177,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And let another hand, not thine, exact"
19178,SAMSON AGONISTES,Thy penal forfeit from thy self; perhaps
19179,SAMSON AGONISTES,"God will relent, and quit thee all his debt;"
19180,SAMSON AGONISTES,Who evermore approves and more accepts                              510
19181,SAMSON AGONISTES,(Best pleas'd with humble and filial submission)
19182,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Him who imploring mercy sues for life,"
19183,SAMSON AGONISTES,Then who selfrigorous chooses death as due;
19184,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Which argues overjust, and self-displeas'd"
19185,SAMSON AGONISTES,"For self-offence, more then for God offended."
19186,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Reject not then what offerd means, who knows"
19187,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But God hath set before us, to return thee"
19188,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Home to thy countrey and his sacred house,"
19189,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Where thou mayst bring thy off'rings, to avert"
19190,SAMSON AGONISTES,"His further ire, with praiers and vows renew'd.                     520"
19191,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19192,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  His pardon I implore; but as for life,"
19193,SAMSON AGONISTES,To what end should I seek it? when in strength
19194,SAMSON AGONISTES,"All mortals I excell'd, and great in hopes"
19195,SAMSON AGONISTES,With youthful courage and magnanimous thoughts
19196,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of birth from  Heav'n foretold and high exploits,"
19197,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Full of divine instinct, after some proof"
19198,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of acts indeed heroic, far beyond"
19199,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The Sons of Anac, famous now and blaz'd,"
19200,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Fearless of danger, like a petty God"
19201,SAMSON AGONISTES,I walk'd about admir'd of all and dreaded                           530
19202,SAMSON AGONISTES,"On hostile ground, none daring my affront."
19203,SAMSON AGONISTES,Then swoll'n with pride into the snare I fell
19204,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of fair fallacious looks, venereal trains,"
19205,SAMSON AGONISTES,Softn'd with pleasure and voluptuous life;
19206,SAMSON AGONISTES,At length to lay my head and hallow'd pledge
19207,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of all my strength in the lascivious lap
19208,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of a deceitful Concubine who shore me
19209,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Like a tame Weather, all my precious fleece,"
19210,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Then turn'd me out ridiculous, despoil'd,"
19211,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Shav'n, and disarm'd among my enemies.                              540"
19212,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19213,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor.  Desire of wine and all delicious drinks,"
19214,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Which many a famous Warriour overturns,"
19215,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thou couldst repress, nor did the dancing Rubie"
19216,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sparkling; out-pow'rd, the flavor, or the smell,"
19217,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or taste that cheers the heart of Gods and men,"
19218,SAMSON AGONISTES,Allure thee from the cool Crystalline stream.
19219,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19220,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam. Where ever fountain or fresh current flow'd
19221,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Against the Eastern ray, translucent, pure,"
19222,SAMSON AGONISTES,With touch aetherial of Heav'ns fiery rod
19223,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I drank, from the clear milkie juice allaying                       550"
19224,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thirst, and refresht; nor envy'd them the grape"
19225,SAMSON AGONISTES,Whose heads that turbulent liquor fills with fumes.
19226,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19227,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor.  O madness, to think use of strongest wines"
19228,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And strongest drinks our chief support of health,"
19229,SAMSON AGONISTES,When God with these forbid'n made choice to rear
19230,SAMSON AGONISTES,"His mighty Champion, strong above compare,"
19231,SAMSON AGONISTES,Whose drink was only from the liquid brook.
19232,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19233,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam.  But what avail'd this temperance, not compleat"
19234,SAMSON AGONISTES,Against another object more enticing?
19235,SAMSON AGONISTES,"What boots it at one gate to make defence,                          560"
19236,SAMSON AGONISTES,And at another to let in the foe
19237,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Effeminatly vanquish't? by which means,"
19238,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Now blind, disheartn'd, sham'd, dishonour'd, quell'd,"
19239,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To what can I be useful, wherein serve"
19240,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My Nation, and the work from Heav'n impos'd,"
19241,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But to sit idle on the houshold hearth,"
19242,SAMSON AGONISTES,"A burdenous drone; to visitants a gaze,"
19243,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or pitied object, these redundant locks"
19244,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Robustious to no purpose clustring down,"
19245,SAMSON AGONISTES,Vain monument of strength; till length of years                     570
19246,SAMSON AGONISTES,And sedentary numness craze my limbs
19247,SAMSON AGONISTES,To a contemptible old age obscure.
19248,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Here rather let me drudge and earn my bread,"
19249,SAMSON AGONISTES,Till vermin or the draff of servil food
19250,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Consume me, and oft-invocated death"
19251,SAMSON AGONISTES,Hast'n the welcom end of all my pains.
19252,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19253,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man.  Wilt thou then serve the Philistines with that gift
19254,SAMSON AGONISTES,Which was expresly giv'n thee to annoy them?
19255,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Better at home lie bed-rid, not only idle,"
19256,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Inglorious, unimploy'd, with age out-worn.                          580"
19257,SAMSON AGONISTES,But God who caus'd a fountain at thy prayer
19258,SAMSON AGONISTES,"From the dry ground to spring, thy thirst to allay"
19259,SAMSON AGONISTES,"After the brunt of battel, can as easie"
19260,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Cause light again within thy eies to spring,"
19261,SAMSON AGONISTES,Wherewith to serve him better then thou hast;
19262,SAMSON AGONISTES,And I perswade me so; why else this strength
19263,SAMSON AGONISTES,Miraculous yet remaining in those locks?
19264,SAMSON AGONISTES,"His might continues in thee not for naught,"
19265,SAMSON AGONISTES,Nor shall his wondrous gifts be frustrate thus.
19266,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19267,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  All otherwise to me my thoughts portend,                      590"
19268,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That these dark orbs no more shall treat with light,"
19269,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nor th' other light of life continue long,"
19270,SAMSON AGONISTES,But yield to double darkness nigh at hand:
19271,SAMSON AGONISTES,"So much I feel my genial spirits droop,"
19272,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My hopes all flat, nature within me seems"
19273,SAMSON AGONISTES,In all her functions weary of herself;
19274,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My race of glory run, and race of shame,"
19275,SAMSON AGONISTES,And I shall shortly be with them that rest.
19276,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19277,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man.  Believe not these suggestions which proceed
19278,SAMSON AGONISTES,"From anguish of the mind and humours black,                         600"
19279,SAMSON AGONISTES,That mingle with thy fancy.  I however
19280,SAMSON AGONISTES,Must not omit a Fathers timely care
19281,SAMSON AGONISTES,To prosecute the means of thy deliverance
19282,SAMSON AGONISTES,"By ransom or how else: mean while be calm,"
19283,SAMSON AGONISTES,And healing words from these thy friends admit.
19284,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19285,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam.  O that torment should not be confin'd
19286,SAMSON AGONISTES,To the bodies wounds and sores
19287,SAMSON AGONISTES,With maladies innumerable
19288,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In heart, head, brest, and reins;"
19289,SAMSON AGONISTES,But must secret passage find                                        610
19290,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To th' inmost mind,"
19291,SAMSON AGONISTES,"There exercise all his fierce accidents,"
19292,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And on her purest spirits prey,"
19293,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As on entrails, joints, and limbs,"
19294,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With answerable pains, but more intense,"
19295,SAMSON AGONISTES,'Though void of corporal sense.
19296,SAMSON AGONISTES,My griefs not only pain me
19297,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As a lingring disease,"
19298,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But finding no redress, ferment and rage,"
19299,SAMSON AGONISTES,Nor less then wounds immedicable                                    620
19300,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Ranckle, and fester, and gangrene,"

19303,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Mangle my apprehensive tenderest parts,"
19304,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Exasperate, exulcerate, and raise"
19305,SAMSON AGONISTES,Dire inflammation which no cooling herb
19306,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or medcinal liquor can asswage,"
19307,SAMSON AGONISTES,Nor breath of Vernal Air from snowy Alp.
19308,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sleep hath forsook and giv'n me o're

19311,SAMSON AGONISTES,And sense of Heav'ns desertion.

19313,SAMSON AGONISTES,"His destin'd from the womb,"
19314,SAMSON AGONISTES,Promisd by Heavenly message twice descending.
19315,SAMSON AGONISTES,Under his special eie
19316,SAMSON AGONISTES,Abstemious I grew up and thriv'd amain;
19317,SAMSON AGONISTES,He led me on to mightiest deeds
19318,SAMSON AGONISTES,Above the nerve of mortal arm
19319,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Against the uncircumcis'd, our enemies.                             640"

19321,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And to those cruel enemies,"
19322,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Whom I by his appointment had provok't,"
19323,SAMSON AGONISTES,Left me all helpless with th' irreparable loss
19324,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of sight, reserv'd alive to be repeated"
19325,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The subject of thir cruelty, or scorn."
19326,SAMSON AGONISTES,Nor am I in the list of them that hope;

19330,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The close of all my miseries, and the balm."
19331,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19332,SAMSON AGONISTES,Chor:  Many are the sayings of the wise
19333,SAMSON AGONISTES,In antient and in modern books enroll'd;
19334,SAMSON AGONISTES,Extolling Patience as the truest fortitude;
19335,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And to the bearing well of all calamities,"
19336,SAMSON AGONISTES,All chances incident to mans frail life
19337,SAMSON AGONISTES,Consolatories writ
19338,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With studied argument, and much perswasion sought"
19339,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Lenient of grief and anxious thought,"
19340,SAMSON AGONISTES,But with th' afflicted in his pangs thir sound                      680
19341,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Little prevails, or rather seems a tune,"
19342,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Harsh, and of dissonant mood from his complaint,"
19343,SAMSON AGONISTES,Unless he feel within
19344,SAMSON AGONISTES,Some sourse of consolation from above;
19345,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Secret refreshings, that repair his strength,"
19346,SAMSON AGONISTES,And fainting spirits uphold.
19347,SAMSON AGONISTES,"God of our Fathers, what is man!"
19348,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That thou towards him with hand so various,"
19349,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or might I say contrarious,"
19350,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Temperst thy providence through his short course,                   670"
19351,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Not evenly, as thou rul'st"
19352,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The Angelic orders and inferiour creatures mute,"
19353,SAMSON AGONISTES,Irrational and brute.
19354,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nor do I name of men the common rout,"
19355,SAMSON AGONISTES,That wandring loose about
19356,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Grow up and perish, as the summer flie,"
19357,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Heads without name no more rememberd,"
19358,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But such as thou hast solemnly elected,"
19359,SAMSON AGONISTES,With gifts and graces eminently adorn'd
19360,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To some great work, thy glory,                                      680"
19361,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And peoples safety, which in part they effect:"
19362,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Yet toward these thus dignifi'd, thou oft"
19363,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Amidst thir highth of noon,"
19364,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Changest thy countenance, and thy hand with no regard"
19365,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of highest favours past
19366,SAMSON AGONISTES,"From thee on them, or them to thee of service."
19367,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nor only dost degrade them, or remit"
19368,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To life obscur'd, which were a fair dismission,"
19369,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But throw'st them lower then thou didst exalt them high,"
19370,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Unseemly falls in human eie,                                        690"
19371,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Too grievous for the trespass or omission,"
19372,SAMSON AGONISTES,Oft leav'st them to the hostile sword
19373,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of Heathen and prophane, thir carkasses"
19374,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To dogs and fowls a prey, or else captiv'd:"
19375,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or to the unjust tribunals, under change of times,"
19376,SAMSON AGONISTES,And condemnation of the ingrateful multitude.
19377,SAMSON AGONISTES,"If these they scape, perhaps in poverty"
19378,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With sickness and disease thou bow'st them down,"

19380,SAMSON AGONISTES,In crude old age;
19381,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Though not disordinate, yet causless suffring"
19382,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The punishment of dissolute days, in fine,"
19383,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Just or unjust, alike seem miserable,"
19384,SAMSON AGONISTES,"For oft alike, both come to evil end."
19385,SAMSON AGONISTES,"So deal not with this once thy glorious Champion,"
19386,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The Image of thy strength, and mighty minister."
19387,SAMSON AGONISTES,What do I beg? how hast thou dealt already?
19388,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Behold him in this state calamitous, and turn"
19389,SAMSON AGONISTES,"His labours, for thou canst, to peaceful end."
19390,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But who is this, what thing of Sea or Land?                         710"
19391,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Femal of sex it seems,"
19392,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That so bedeckt, ornate, and gay,"
19393,SAMSON AGONISTES,Comes this way sailing
19394,SAMSON AGONISTES,Like a stately Ship
19395,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of Tarsus, bound for th' Isles"
19396,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of Javan or Gadier
19397,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With all her bravery on, and tackle trim,"
19398,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sails fill'd, and streamers waving,"
19399,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Courted by all the winds that hold them play,"
19400,SAMSON AGONISTES,An Amber sent of odorous perfume                                    720
19401,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Her harbinger, a damsel train behind;"
19402,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Some rich Philistian Matron she may seem,"
19403,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And now at nearer view, no other certain"
19404,SAMSON AGONISTES,Than Dalila thy wife.
19405,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19406,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  My Wife, my Traytress, let her not come near me."
19407,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19408,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Cho:  Yet on she moves, now stands & eies thee fixt,"
19409,SAMSON AGONISTES,"About t'have spoke, but now, with head declin'd"
19410,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Like a fair flower surcharg'd with dew, she weeps"
19411,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And words addrest seem into tears dissolv'd,"
19412,SAMSON AGONISTES,Wetting the borders of her silk'n veil:                             730
19413,SAMSON AGONISTES,But now again she makes address to speak.
19414,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19415,SAMSON AGONISTES,Dal:  With doubtful feet and wavering resolution
19416,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I came, still dreading thy displeasure, Samson,"
19417,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Which to have merited, without excuse,"
19418,SAMSON AGONISTES,I cannot but acknowledge; yet if tears
19419,SAMSON AGONISTES,May expiate (though the fact more evil drew
19420,SAMSON AGONISTES,In the perverse event then I foresaw)
19421,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My penance hath not slack'n'd, though my pardon"
19422,SAMSON AGONISTES,No way assur'd.  But conjugal affection
19423,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Prevailing over fear, and timerous doubt                            740"
19424,SAMSON AGONISTES,Hath led me on desirous to behold
19425,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Once more thy face, and know of thy estate."
19426,SAMSON AGONISTES,If aught in my ability may serve
19427,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To light'n what thou suffer'st, and appease"
19428,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thy mind with what amends is in my power,"
19429,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Though late, yet in some part to recompense"
19430,SAMSON AGONISTES,My rash but more unfortunate misdeed.
19431,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19432,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Out, out Hyaena; these are thy wonted arts,"
19433,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And arts of every woman false like thee,"
19434,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To break all faith, all vows, deceive, betray,                      750"
19435,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Then as repentant to submit, beseech,"
19436,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And reconcilement move with feign'd remorse,"
19437,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Confess, and promise wonders in her change,"
19438,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Not truly penitent, but chief to try"
19439,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Her husband, how far urg'd his patience bears,"
19440,SAMSON AGONISTES,His vertue or weakness which way to assail:
19441,SAMSON AGONISTES,Then with more cautious and instructed skill
19442,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Again transgresses, and again submits;"
19443,SAMSON AGONISTES,That wisest and best men full oft beguil'd
19444,SAMSON AGONISTES,With goodness principl'd not to reject                              760
19445,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The penitent, but ever to forgive,"
19446,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Are drawn to wear out miserable days,"
19447,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Entangl'd with a poysnous bosom snake,"
19448,SAMSON AGONISTES,If not by quick destruction soon cut off
19449,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As I by thee, to Ages an example."
19450,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19451,SAMSON AGONISTES,Dal: Yet hear me Samson; not that I endeavour
19452,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To lessen or extenuate my offence,"
19453,SAMSON AGONISTES,But that on th' other side if it be weigh'd
19454,SAMSON AGONISTES,"By it self, with aggravations not surcharg'd,"
19455,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or else with just allowance counterpois'd                           770
19456,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I may, if possible, thy pardon find"
19457,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The easier towards me, or thy hatred less."
19458,SAMSON AGONISTES,"First granting, as I do, it was a weakness"
19459,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In me, but incident to all our sex,"
19460,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Curiosity, inquisitive, importune"
19461,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of secrets, then with like infirmity"
19462,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To publish them, both common female faults:"
19463,SAMSON AGONISTES,Was it not weakness also to make known
19464,SAMSON AGONISTES,"For importunity, that is for naught,"
19465,SAMSON AGONISTES,Wherein consisted all thy strength and safety?                      780
19466,SAMSON AGONISTES,To what I did thou shewdst me first the way.
19467,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But I to enemies reveal'd, and should not."
19468,SAMSON AGONISTES,Nor shouldst thou have trusted that to womans frailty
19469,SAMSON AGONISTES,"E're I to thee, thou to thy self wast cruel."
19470,SAMSON AGONISTES,Let weakness then with weakness come to parl
19471,SAMSON AGONISTES,"So near related, or the same of kind,"
19472,SAMSON AGONISTES,Thine forgive mine; that men may censure thine
19473,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The gentler, if severely thou exact not"
19474,SAMSON AGONISTES,"More strength from me, then in thy self was found."
19475,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And what if Love, which thou interpret'st hate,                     790"
19476,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The jealousie of Love, powerful of sway"
19477,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In human hearts, nor less in mine towards thee,"
19478,SAMSON AGONISTES,Caus'd what I did? I saw thee mutable
19479,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of fancy, feard lest one day thou wouldst leave me"
19480,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As her at Timna, sought by all means therefore"
19481,SAMSON AGONISTES,"How to endear, and hold thee to me firmest:"
19482,SAMSON AGONISTES,No better way I saw then by importuning
19483,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To learn thy secrets, get into my power"
19484,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thy key of strength and safety: thou wilt say,"
19485,SAMSON AGONISTES,Why then reveal'd? I was assur'd by those                           800
19486,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Who tempted me, that nothing was design'd"
19487,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Against thee but safe custody, and hold:"
19488,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That made for me, I knew that liberty"
19489,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Would draw thee forth to perilous enterprises,"
19490,SAMSON AGONISTES,While I at home sate full of cares and fears
19491,SAMSON AGONISTES,Wailing thy absence in my widow'd bed;
19492,SAMSON AGONISTES,Here I should still enjoy thee day and night
19493,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Mine and Loves prisoner, not the Philistines,"
19494,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Whole to my self, unhazarded abroad,"
19495,SAMSON AGONISTES,Fearless at home of partners in my love.                            810
19496,SAMSON AGONISTES,"These reasons in Loves law have past for good,"
19497,SAMSON AGONISTES,Though fond and reasonless to some perhaps:
19498,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And Love hath oft, well meaning, wrought much wo,"
19499,SAMSON AGONISTES,Yet always pity or pardon hath obtain'd.
19500,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Be not unlike all others, not austere"
19501,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As thou art strong, inflexible as steel."
19502,SAMSON AGONISTES,"If thou in strength all mortals dost exceed,"
19503,SAMSON AGONISTES,In uncompassionate anger do not so.
19504,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19505,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam:  How cunningly the sorceress displays
19506,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Her own transgressions, to upbraid me mine!                         820"
19507,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That malice not repentance brought thee hither,"
19508,SAMSON AGONISTES,"By this appears: I gave, thou say'st, th' example,"
19509,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I led the way; bitter reproach, but true,"
19510,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I to my self was false e're thou to me,"
19511,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Such pardon therefore as I give my folly,"
19512,SAMSON AGONISTES,Take to thy wicked deed: which when thou seest
19513,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Impartial, self-severe, inexorable,"
19514,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thou wilt renounce thy seeking, and much rather"
19515,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Confess it feign'd, weakness is thy excuse,"
19516,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And I believe it, weakness to resist                                830"
19517,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Philistian gold: if weakness may excuse,"
19518,SAMSON AGONISTES,"What Murtherer, what Traytor, Parricide,"
19519,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Incestuous, Sacrilegious, but may plead it?"
19520,SAMSON AGONISTES,All wickedness is weakness: that plea therefore
19521,SAMSON AGONISTES,With God or Man will gain thee no remission.
19522,SAMSON AGONISTES,But Love constrain'd thee; call it furious rage
19523,SAMSON AGONISTES,To satisfie thy lust: Love seeks to have Love;
19524,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My love how couldst thou hope, who tookst the way"
19525,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To raise in me inexpiable hate,"
19526,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Knowing, as needs I must, by thee betray'd?                        840"
19527,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In vain thou striv'st to cover shame with shame,"
19528,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or by evasions thy crime uncoverst more.
19529,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19530,SAMSON AGONISTES,Dal:  Since thou determinst weakness for no plea
19531,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In man or woman, though to thy own condemning,"
19532,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Hear what assaults I had, what snares besides,"
19533,SAMSON AGONISTES,"What sieges girt me round, e're I consented;"
19534,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Which might have aw'd the best resolv'd of men,"
19535,SAMSON AGONISTES,The constantest to have yielded without blame.
19536,SAMSON AGONISTES,"It was not gold, as to my charge thou lay'st,"
19537,SAMSON AGONISTES,That wrought with me: thou know'st the Magistrates                  850
19538,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And Princes of my countrey came in person,"
19539,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sollicited, commanded, threatn'd, urg'd,"
19540,SAMSON AGONISTES,Adjur'd by all the bonds of civil Duty
19541,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And of Religion, press'd how just it was,"
19542,SAMSON AGONISTES,"How honourable, how glorious to entrap"
19543,SAMSON AGONISTES,"A common enemy, who had destroy'd"
19544,SAMSON AGONISTES,Such numbers of our Nation: and the Priest
19545,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Was not behind, but ever at my ear,"
19546,SAMSON AGONISTES,Preaching how meritorious with the gods
19547,SAMSON AGONISTES,It would be to ensnare an irreligious                               860
19548,SAMSON AGONISTES,Dishonourer of Dagon: what had I
19549,SAMSON AGONISTES,To oppose against such powerful arguments?
19550,SAMSON AGONISTES,Only my love of thee held long debate;
19551,SAMSON AGONISTES,And combated in silence all these reasons
19552,SAMSON AGONISTES,With hard contest: at length that grounded maxim
19553,SAMSON AGONISTES,So rife and celebrated in the mouths
19554,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of wisest men; that to the public good
19555,SAMSON AGONISTES,Private respects must yield; with grave authority'
19556,SAMSON AGONISTES,Took full possession of me and prevail'd;
19557,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Vertue, as I thought, truth, duty so enjoyning.                     870"
19558,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19559,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam:  I thought where all thy circling wiles would end;
19560,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In feign'd Religion, smooth hypocrisie."
19561,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But had thy love, still odiously pretended,"
19562,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Bin, as it ought, sincere, it would have taught thee"
19563,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Far other reasonings, brought forth other deeds."
19564,SAMSON AGONISTES,I before all the daughters of my Tribe
19565,SAMSON AGONISTES,And of my Nation chose thee from among
19566,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My enemies, lov'd thee, as too well thou knew'st,"
19567,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Too well, unbosom'd all my secrets to thee,"
19568,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Not out of levity, but over-powr'd                                  880"
19569,SAMSON AGONISTES,"By thy request, who could deny thee nothing;"
19570,SAMSON AGONISTES,Yet now am judg'd an enemy.  Why then
19571,SAMSON AGONISTES,Didst thou at first receive me for thy husband?
19572,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Then, as since then, thy countries foe profest:"
19573,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Being once a wife, for me thou wast to leave"
19574,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Parents and countrey; nor was I their subject,"
19575,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nor under their protection but my own,"
19576,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thou mine, not theirs: if aught against my life"
19577,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thy countrey sought of thee, it sought unjustly,"
19578,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Against the law of nature, law of nations,                          890"
19579,SAMSON AGONISTES,"No more thy countrey, but an impious crew"
19580,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of men conspiring to uphold thir state
19581,SAMSON AGONISTES,"By worse than hostile deeds, violating the ends"
19582,SAMSON AGONISTES,For which our countrey is a name so dear;
19583,SAMSON AGONISTES,Not therefore to be obey'd.  But zeal mov'd thee;
19584,SAMSON AGONISTES,To please thy gods thou didst it; gods unable
19585,SAMSON AGONISTES,To acquit themselves and prosecute their foes
19586,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But by ungodly deeds, the contradiction"
19587,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of their own deity, Gods cannot be:"
19588,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Less therefore to be pleas'd, obey'd, or fear'd,                    900"
19589,SAMSON AGONISTES,"These false pretexts and varnish'd colours failing,"
19590,SAMSON AGONISTES,Bare in thy guilt how foul must thou appear?
19591,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19592,SAMSON AGONISTES,Dal:  In argument with men a woman ever
19593,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Goes by the worse, whatever be her cause."
19594,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19595,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  For want of words no doubt, or lack of breath,"
19596,SAMSON AGONISTES,Witness when I was worried with thy peals.
19597,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19598,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Dal:  I was a fool, too rash, and quite mistaken"
19599,SAMSON AGONISTES,In what I thought would have succeeded best.
19600,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Let me obtain forgiveness of thee, Samson,"
19601,SAMSON AGONISTES,Afford me place to shew what recompence                             910
19602,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Towards thee I intend for what I have misdone,"
19603,SAMSON AGONISTES,Misguided: only what remains past cure
19604,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Bear not too sensibly, nor still insist"
19605,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To afflict thy self in vain: though sight be lost,"
19606,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Life yet hath many solaces, enjoy'd"
19607,SAMSON AGONISTES,Where other senses want not their delights
19608,SAMSON AGONISTES,"At home in leisure and domestic ease,"
19609,SAMSON AGONISTES,Exempt from many a care and chance to which

19774,SAMSON AGONISTES,Comes he in peace? what wind hath blown him hither                 1070
19775,SAMSON AGONISTES,I less conjecture then when first I saw
19776,SAMSON AGONISTES,The sumptuous Dalila floating this way:

19786,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Men call me Harapha, of stock renown'd"
19787,SAMSON AGONISTES,As Og or Anak and the Emims old                                    1080
19788,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That Kiriathaim held, thou knowst me now"
19789,SAMSON AGONISTES,If thou at all art known.  Much I have heard
19790,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of thy prodigious might and feats perform'd
19791,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Incredible to me, in this displeas'd,"
19792,SAMSON AGONISTES,That I was never present on the place
19793,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of those encounters, where we might have tri'd"
19794,SAMSON AGONISTES,Each others force in camp or listed field:
19795,SAMSON AGONISTES,And now am come to see of whom such noise

19801,SAMSON AGONISTES,Har:  Dost thou already single me; I thought
19802,SAMSON AGONISTES,Gives and the Mill had tam'd thee? O that fortune
19803,SAMSON AGONISTES,Had brought me to the field where thou art fam'd
19804,SAMSON AGONISTES,To have wrought such wonders with an Asses Jaw;
19805,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I should have forc'd thee soon with other arms,"
19806,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or left thy carkass where the Ass lay thrown:
19807,SAMSON AGONISTES,So had the glory of Prowess been recover'd
19808,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To Palestine, won by a Philistine"
19809,SAMSON AGONISTES,"From the unforeskinn'd race, of whom thou hear'st                  1100"

19814,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Boast not of what thou wouldst have done, but do"
19815,SAMSON AGONISTES,"What then thou would'st, thou seest it in thy hand."
19816,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19817,SAMSON AGONISTES,Har:  To combat with a blind man I disdain
19818,SAMSON AGONISTES,And thou hast need much washing to be toucht.
19819,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19820,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam:  Such usage as your honourable Lords

19825,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Close-banded durst attaque me, no not sleeping,"
19826,SAMSON AGONISTES,Till they had hir'd a woman with their gold
19827,SAMSON AGONISTES,Breaking her Marriage Faith to circumvent me.
19828,SAMSON AGONISTES,Therefore without feign'd shifts let be assign'd
19829,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Some narrow place enclos'd, where sight may give thee."
19830,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or rather flight, no great advantage on me;"

19838,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That in a little time while breath remains thee,"
19839,SAMSON AGONISTES,Thou oft shalt wish thy self at Gath to boast
19840,SAMSON AGONISTES,Again in safety what thou wouldst have done
19841,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To Samson, but shalt never see Gath more."
19842,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19843,SAMSON AGONISTES,Har: Thou durst not thus disparage glorious arms                   1130

19870,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19871,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Har:  Presume not on thy God, what e're he be,"
19872,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thee he regards not, owns not, hath cut off"
19873,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Quite from his people, and delivered up"
19874,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Into thy Enemies hand, permitted them"
19875,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To put out both thine eyes, and fetter'd send thee                 1160"

19895,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Har:  Fair honour that thou dost thy God, in trusting"
19896,SAMSON AGONISTES,"He will accept thee to defend his cause,"
19897,SAMSON AGONISTES,"A Murtherer, a Revolter, and a Robber.                             1180"
19898,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19899,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam: Tongue-doubtie Giant, how dost thou prove me these?"
19900,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19901,SAMSON AGONISTES,Har:  Is not thy Nation subject to our Lords?
19902,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thir Magistrates confest it, when they took thee"
19903,SAMSON AGONISTES,As a League-breaker and deliver'd bound
19904,SAMSON AGONISTES,Into our hands: for hadst thou not committed
19905,SAMSON AGONISTES,Notorious murder on those thirty men
19906,SAMSON AGONISTES,"At Askalon, who never did thee harm,"
19907,SAMSON AGONISTES,Then like a Robber stripdst them of thir robes?
19908,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The Philistines, when thou hadst broke the league,"
19909,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Went up with armed powers thee only seeking,                       1190"
19910,SAMSON AGONISTES,To others did no violence nor spoil.
19911,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19912,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam:  Among the Daughters of the Philistines
19913,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I chose a Wife, which argu'd me no foe;"
19914,SAMSON AGONISTES,And in your City held my Nuptial Feast:
19915,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But your ill-meaning Politician Lords,"
19916,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Under pretence of Bridal friends and guests,"
19917,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Appointed to await me thirty spies,"
19918,SAMSON AGONISTES,Who threatning cruel death constrain'd the bride
19919,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To wring from me and tell to them my secret,"
19920,SAMSON AGONISTES,That solv'd the riddle which I had propos'd.                       1200
19921,SAMSON AGONISTES,"When I perceiv'd all set on enmity,"
19922,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As on my enemies, where ever chanc'd,"
19923,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I us'd hostility, and took thir spoil"
19924,SAMSON AGONISTES,To pay my underminers in thir coin.
19925,SAMSON AGONISTES,My Nation was subjected to your Lords.
19926,SAMSON AGONISTES,It was the force of Conquest; force with force
19927,SAMSON AGONISTES,Is well ejected when the Conquer'd can.
19928,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But I a private person, whom my Countrey"
19929,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As a league-breaker gave up bound, presum'd"
19930,SAMSON AGONISTES,Single Rebellion and did Hostile Acts.                             1210
19931,SAMSON AGONISTES,I was no private but a person rais'd
19932,SAMSON AGONISTES,With strength sufficient and command from Heav'n
19933,SAMSON AGONISTES,To free my Countrey; if their servile minds
19934,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Me their Deliverer sent would not receive,"
19935,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But to thir Masters gave me up for nought,"
19936,SAMSON AGONISTES,Th' unworthier they; whence to this day they serve.
19937,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I was to do my part from Heav'n assign'd,"
19938,SAMSON AGONISTES,And had perform'd it if my known offence
19939,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Had not disabl'd me, not all your force:"
19940,SAMSON AGONISTES,"These shifts refuted, answer thy appellant                         1220"
19941,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Though by his blindness maim'd for high attempts,"
19942,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Who now defies thee thrice to single fight,"
19943,SAMSON AGONISTES,As a petty enterprise of small enforce.
19944,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19945,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Har:  With thee a Man condemn'd, a Slave enrol'd,"
19946,SAMSON AGONISTES,Due by the Law to capital punishment?
19947,SAMSON AGONISTES,To fight with thee no man of arms will deign.
19948,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19949,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Cam'st thou for this, vain boaster, to survey me,"
19950,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To descant on my strength, and give thy verdit?"
19951,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Come nearer, part not hence so slight inform'd;"
19952,SAMSON AGONISTES,But take good heed my hand survey not thee.                        1230
19953,SAMSON AGONISTES,Har:  O Baal-zebub! can my ears unus'd
19954,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Hear these dishonours, and not render death?"
19955,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19956,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  No man with-holds thee, nothing from thy hand"
19957,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Fear I incurable; bring up thy van,"
19958,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My heels are fetter'd, but my fist is free."
19959,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19960,SAMSON AGONISTES,Har:  This insolence other kind of answer fits.
19961,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19962,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Go baffl'd coward, lest I run upon thee,"
19963,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Though in these chains, bulk without spirit vast,"
19964,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And with one buffet lay thy structure low,"
19965,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or swing thee in the Air, then dash thee down                      1240"
19966,SAMSON AGONISTES,To the hazard of thy brains and shatter'd sides.
19967,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19968,SAMSON AGONISTES,Har:  By Astaroth e're long thou shalt lament
19969,SAMSON AGONISTES,These braveries in Irons loaden on thee.
19970,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19971,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  His Giantship is gone somewhat crestfall'n,"
19972,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Stalking with less unconsci'nable strides,"
19973,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And lower looks, but in a sultrie chafe."
19974,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19975,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam: I dread him not, nor all his Giant-brood,"
19976,SAMSON AGONISTES,Though Fame divulge him Father of five Sons
19977,SAMSON AGONISTES,"All of Gigantic size, Goliah chief."
19978,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19979,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  He will directly to the Lords, I fear,                      1250"
19980,SAMSON AGONISTES,And with malitious counsel stir them up
19981,SAMSON AGONISTES,Some way or other yet further to afflict thee.
19982,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19983,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  He must allege some cause, and offer'd fight"
19984,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Will not dare mention, lest a question rise"
19985,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Whether he durst accept the offer or not,"
19986,SAMSON AGONISTES,And that he durst not plain enough appear'd.
19987,SAMSON AGONISTES,Much more affliction then already felt
19988,SAMSON AGONISTES,"They cannot well impose, nor I sustain;"
19989,SAMSON AGONISTES,If they intend advantage of my labours
19990,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The work of many hands, which earns my keeping                     1260"
19991,SAMSON AGONISTES,With no small profit daily to my owners.
19992,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But come what will, my deadliest foe will prove"
19993,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My speediest friend, by death to rid me hence,"
19994,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The worst that he can give, to me the best."
19995,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Yet so it may fall out, because thir end"
19996,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Is hate, not help to me, it may with mine"
19997,SAMSON AGONISTES,Draw thir own ruin who attempt the deed.
19998,SAMSON AGONISTES,
19999,SAMSON AGONISTES,Chor:  Oh how comely it is and how reviving
20000,SAMSON AGONISTES,To the Spirits of just men long opprest!
20001,SAMSON AGONISTES,When God into the hands of thir deliverer                          1270
20002,SAMSON AGONISTES,Puts invincible might
20003,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To quell the mighty of the Earth, th' oppressour,"
20004,SAMSON AGONISTES,The brute and boist'rous force of violent men
20005,SAMSON AGONISTES,Hardy and industrious to support
20006,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Tyrannic power, but raging to pursue"
20007,SAMSON AGONISTES,The righteous and all such as honour Truth;
20008,SAMSON AGONISTES,He all thir Ammunition
20009,SAMSON AGONISTES,And feats of War defeats
20010,SAMSON AGONISTES,With plain Heroic magnitude of mind
20011,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And celestial vigour arm'd,                                        1270"
20012,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thir Armories and Magazins contemns,"
20013,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Renders them useless, while"
20014,SAMSON AGONISTES,With winged expedition
20015,SAMSON AGONISTES,Swift as the lightning glance he executes
20016,SAMSON AGONISTES,"His errand on the wicked, who surpris'd"
20017,SAMSON AGONISTES,Lose thir defence distracted and amaz'd.
20018,SAMSON AGONISTES,But patience is more oft the exercise
20019,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of Saints, the trial of thir fortitude,"
20020,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Making them each his own Deliverer,"
20021,SAMSON AGONISTES,And Victor over all                                                1290
20022,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That tyrannie or fortune can inflict,"
20023,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Either of these is in thy lot,"
20024,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Samson, with might endu'd"
20025,SAMSON AGONISTES,Above the Sons of men; but sight bereav'd
20026,SAMSON AGONISTES,May chance to number thee with those
20027,SAMSON AGONISTES,Whom Patience finally must crown.
20028,SAMSON AGONISTES,"This Idols day hath bin to thee no day of rest,"
20029,SAMSON AGONISTES,Labouring thy mind
20030,SAMSON AGONISTES,"More then the working day thy hands,"
20031,SAMSON AGONISTES,And yet perhaps more trouble is behind.                            1300
20032,SAMSON AGONISTES,For I descry this way
20033,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Some other tending, in his hand"
20034,SAMSON AGONISTES,"A Scepter or quaint staff he bears,"
20035,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Comes on amain, speed in his look."
20036,SAMSON AGONISTES,By his habit I discern him now
20037,SAMSON AGONISTES,"A Public Officer, and now at hand."
20038,SAMSON AGONISTES,His message will be short and voluble.
20039,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20040,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Off: Ebrews, the Pris'ner Samson here I seek."
20041,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20042,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  His manacles remark him, there he sits."
20043,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20044,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Off: Samson, to thee our Lords thus bid me say;                    1310"
20045,SAMSON AGONISTES,"This day to Dagon is a solemn Feast,"
20046,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With Sacrifices, Triumph, Pomp, and Games;"
20047,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thy strength they know surpassing human rate,"
20048,SAMSON AGONISTES,And now some public proof thereof require
20049,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To honour this great Feast, and great Assembly;"
20050,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Rise therefore with all speed and come along,"
20051,SAMSON AGONISTES,Where I will see thee heartn'd and fresh clad
20052,SAMSON AGONISTES,To appear as fits before th' illustrious Lords.
20053,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20054,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Thou knowst I am an Ebrew, therefore tell them,"
20055,SAMSON AGONISTES,Our Law forbids at thir Religious Rites                            1320
20056,SAMSON AGONISTES,My presence; for that cause I cannot come.
20057,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20058,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Off: This answer, be assur'd, will not content them."
20059,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20060,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Have they not Sword-players, and ev'ry sort"
20061,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of Gymnic Artists, Wrestlers, Riders, Runners,"
20062,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Juglers and Dancers, Antics, Mummers, Mimics,"
20063,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But they must pick me out with shackles tir'd,"
20064,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And over-labour'd at thir publick Mill,"
20065,SAMSON AGONISTES,To make them sport with blind activity?
20066,SAMSON AGONISTES,Do they not seek occasion of new quarrels
20067,SAMSON AGONISTES,"On my refusal to distress me more,                                 1330"
20068,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or make a game of my calamities?
20069,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Return the way thou cam'st, I will not come."
20070,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20071,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Off:  Regard thy self, this will offend them highly."
20072,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20073,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam: My self? my conscience and internal peace.
20074,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Can they think me so broken, so debas'd"
20075,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With corporal servitude, that my mind ever"
20076,SAMSON AGONISTES,Will condescend to such absurd commands?
20077,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Although thir drudge, to be thir fool or jester,"
20078,SAMSON AGONISTES,And in my midst of sorrow and heart-grief
20079,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To shew them feats, and play before thir god,                      1340"
20080,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The worst of all indignities, yet on me"
20081,SAMSON AGONISTES,Joyn'd with extream contempt? I will not come.
20082,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20083,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Off: My message was impos'd on me with speed,"
20084,SAMSON AGONISTES,Brooks no delay: is this thy resolution?
20085,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20086,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam:  So take it with what speed thy message needs.
20087,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20088,SAMSON AGONISTES,Off: I am sorry what this stoutness will produce.
20089,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20090,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam:  Perhaps thou shalt have cause to sorrow indeed.
20091,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20092,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  Consider, Samson; matters now are strain'd"
20093,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Up to the highth, whether to bold or break;"
20094,SAMSON AGONISTES,"He's gone, and who knows how he may report                         1350"
20095,SAMSON AGONISTES,Thy words by adding fuel to the flame?
20096,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Expect another message more imperious,"
20097,SAMSON AGONISTES,More Lordly thund'ring then thou well wilt bear.
20098,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20099,SAMSON AGONISTES,Sam:  Shall I abuse this Consecrated gift
20100,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of strength, again returning with my hair"
20101,SAMSON AGONISTES,"After my great transgression, so requite"
20102,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Favour renew'd, and add a greater sin"
20103,SAMSON AGONISTES,By prostituting holy things to Idols;
20104,SAMSON AGONISTES,A Nazarite in place abominable
20105,SAMSON AGONISTES,Vaunting my strength in honour to thir Dagon?                      1360
20106,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Besides, how vile, contemptible, ridiculous,"
20107,SAMSON AGONISTES,"What act more execrably unclean, prophane?"
20108,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20109,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  Yet with this strength thou serv'st the Philistines,"
20110,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Idolatrous, uncircumcis'd, unclean."
20111,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20112,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Not in thir Idol-worship, but by labour"
20113,SAMSON AGONISTES,Honest and lawful to deserve my food
20114,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of those who have me in thir civil power.
20115,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20116,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  Where the heart joins not, outward acts defile not"
20117,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20118,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam: Where outward force constrains, the sentence holds:"
20119,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But who constrains me to the Temple of Dagon,                      1370"
20120,SAMSON AGONISTES,Not dragging? the Philistian Lords command.
20121,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Commands are no constraints.  If I obey them,"
20122,SAMSON AGONISTES,I do it freely; venturing to displease
20123,SAMSON AGONISTES,"God for the fear of Man, and Man prefer,"
20124,SAMSON AGONISTES,Set God behind: which in his jealousie
20125,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Shall never, unrepented, find forgiveness."
20126,SAMSON AGONISTES,Yet that he may dispense with me or thee
20127,SAMSON AGONISTES,Present in Temples at Idolatrous Rites
20128,SAMSON AGONISTES,"For some important cause, thou needst not doubt."
20129,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20130,SAMSON AGONISTES,Chor:  How thou wilt here come off surmounts my reach.             1380
20131,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20132,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Be of good courage, I begin to feel"
20133,SAMSON AGONISTES,Some rouzing motions in me which dispose
20134,SAMSON AGONISTES,To something extraordinary my thoughts.
20135,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I with this Messenger will go along,"
20136,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nothing to do, be sure, that may dishonour"
20137,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Our Law, or stain my vow of Nazarite."
20138,SAMSON AGONISTES,"If there be aught of presage in the mind,"
20139,SAMSON AGONISTES,This day will be remarkable in my life
20140,SAMSON AGONISTES,"By some great act, or of my days the last."
20141,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20142,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  In time thou hast resolv'd, the man returns.                1390"
20143,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20144,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Off: Samson, this second message from our Lords"
20145,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To thee I am bid say. Art thou our Slave,"
20146,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Our Captive, at the public Mill our drudge,"
20147,SAMSON AGONISTES,And dar'st thou at our sending and command
20148,SAMSON AGONISTES,Dispute thy coming? come without delay;
20149,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or we shall find such Engines to assail
20150,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And hamper thee, as thou shalt come of force,"
20151,SAMSON AGONISTES,Though thou wert firmlier fastn'd then a rock.
20152,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20153,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  I could be well content to try thir Art,"
20154,SAMSON AGONISTES,Which to no few of them would prove pernicious.                    1400
20155,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Yet knowing thir advantages too many,"
20156,SAMSON AGONISTES,Because they shall not trail me through thir streets
20157,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Like a wild Beast, I am content to go."
20158,SAMSON AGONISTES,Masters commands come with a power resistless
20159,SAMSON AGONISTES,To such as owe them absolute subjection;
20160,SAMSON AGONISTES,And for a life who will not change his purpose?
20161,SAMSON AGONISTES,(So mutable are all the ways of men)
20162,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Yet this be sure, in nothing to comply"
20163,SAMSON AGONISTES,Scandalous or forbidden in our Law.
20164,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20165,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Off:  I praise thy resolution, doff these links:                   1410"
20166,SAMSON AGONISTES,By this compliance thou wilt win the Lords
20167,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To favour, and perhaps to set thee free."
20168,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20169,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sam:  Brethren farewel, your company along"
20170,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I will not wish, lest it perhaps offend them"
20171,SAMSON AGONISTES,To see me girt with Friends; and how the sight
20172,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of me as of a common Enemy,"
20173,SAMSON AGONISTES,"So dreaded once, may now exasperate them"
20174,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I know not.  Lords are Lordliest in thir wine,"
20175,SAMSON AGONISTES,And the well-feasted Priest then soonest fir'd
20176,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With zeal, if aught Religion seem concern'd:                       1420"
20177,SAMSON AGONISTES,No less the people on thir Holy-days
20178,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Impetuous, insolent, unquenchable;"
20179,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Happ'n what may, of me expect to hear"
20180,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nothing dishonourable, impure, unworthy"
20181,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Our God, our Law, my Nation, or my self,"
20182,SAMSON AGONISTES,The last of me or no I cannot warrant.
20183,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20184,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  Go, and the Holy One"
20185,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of Israel be thy guide
20186,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To what may serve his glory best, & spread his name"
20187,SAMSON AGONISTES,Great among the Heathen round:                                     1430
20188,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Send thee the Angel of thy Birth, to stand"
20189,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Fast by thy side, who from thy Fathers field"
20190,SAMSON AGONISTES,Rode up in flames after his message told
20191,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of thy conception, and be now a shield"
20192,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of fire; that Spirit that first rusht on thee
20193,SAMSON AGONISTES,In the camp of Dan
20194,SAMSON AGONISTES,Be efficacious in thee now at need.
20195,SAMSON AGONISTES,For never was from Heaven imparted
20196,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Measure of strength so great to mortal seed,"
20197,SAMSON AGONISTES,As in thy wond'rous actions Hath been seen.                        1440
20198,SAMSON AGONISTES,But wherefore comes old Manoa in such hast
20199,SAMSON AGONISTES,With youthful steps? much livelier than e're while
20200,SAMSON AGONISTES,"He seems: supposing here to find his Son,"
20201,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or of him bringing to us some glad news?
20202,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20203,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man:  Peace with you brethren; my inducement hither
20204,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Was not at present here to find my Son,"
20205,SAMSON AGONISTES,By order of the Lords new parted hence
20206,SAMSON AGONISTES,To come and play before them at thir Feast.
20207,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I heard all as I came, the City rings"
20208,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And numbers thither flock, I had no will,                          1450"
20209,SAMSON AGONISTES,Lest I should see him forc't to things unseemly.
20210,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But that which moved my coming now, was chiefly"
20211,SAMSON AGONISTES,To give ye part with me what hope I have
20212,SAMSON AGONISTES,With good success to work his liberty.
20213,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20214,SAMSON AGONISTES,Chor:  That hope would much rejoyce us to partake
20215,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With thee; say reverend Sire, we thirst to hear."
20216,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20217,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man:  I have attempted one by one the Lords
20218,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Either at home, or through the high street passing,"
20219,SAMSON AGONISTES,With supplication prone and Fathers tears
20220,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To accept of ransom for my Son thir pris'ner,                      1460"
20221,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Some much averse I found and wondrous harsh,"
20222,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Contemptuous, proud, set on revenge and spite;"
20223,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That part most reverenc'd Dagon and his Priests,"
20224,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Others more moderate seeming, but thir aim"
20225,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Private reward, for which both God and State"
20226,SAMSON AGONISTES,"They easily would set to sale, a third"
20227,SAMSON AGONISTES,"More generous far and civil, who confess'd"
20228,SAMSON AGONISTES,"They had anough reveng'd, having reduc't"
20229,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thir foe to misery beneath thir fears,"
20230,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The rest was magnanimity to remit,                                 1470"
20231,SAMSON AGONISTES,If some convenient ransom were propos'd.
20232,SAMSON AGONISTES,What noise or shout was that? it tore the Skie.
20233,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20234,SAMSON AGONISTES,Chor:  Doubtless the people shouting to behold
20235,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thir once great dread, captive, & blind before them,"
20236,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or at some proof of strength before them shown.
20237,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20238,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man:  His ransom, if my whole inheritance"
20239,SAMSON AGONISTES,"May compass it, shall willingly be paid"
20240,SAMSON AGONISTES,And numberd down: much rather I shall chuse
20241,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To live the poorest in my Tribe, then richest,"
20242,SAMSON AGONISTES,And he in that calamitous prison left.                             1480
20243,SAMSON AGONISTES,"No, I am fixt not to part hence without him."
20244,SAMSON AGONISTES,"For his redemption all my Patrimony,"
20245,SAMSON AGONISTES,"If need be, I am ready to forgo"
20246,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And quit: not wanting him, I shall want nothing."
20247,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20248,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  Fathers are wont to lay up for thir Sons,"
20249,SAMSON AGONISTES,Thou for thy Son art bent to lay out all;
20250,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sons wont to nurse thir Parents in old age,"
20251,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thou in old age car'st how to nurse thy Son,"
20252,SAMSON AGONISTES,Made older then thy age through eye-sight lost.
20253,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20254,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man: It shall be my delight to tend his eyes,                      1490"
20255,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And view him sitting in the house, enobl'd"
20256,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With all those high exploits by him atchiev'd,"
20257,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And on his shoulders waving down those locks,"
20258,SAMSON AGONISTES,That of a Nation arm'd the strength contain'd:
20259,SAMSON AGONISTES,And I perswade me God had not permitted
20260,SAMSON AGONISTES,His strength again to grow up with his hair
20261,SAMSON AGONISTES,Garrison'd round about him like a Camp
20262,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of faithful Souldiery, were not his purpose"
20263,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To use him further yet in some great service,"
20264,SAMSON AGONISTES,Not to sit idle with so great a gift                               1500
20265,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Useless, and thence ridiculous about him."
20266,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And since his strength with eye-sight was not lost,"
20267,SAMSON AGONISTES,God will restore him eye-sight to his strength.
20268,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20269,SAMSON AGONISTES,Chor:  Thy hopes are not ill founded nor seem vain
20270,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of his delivery, and thy joy thereon"
20271,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Conceiv'd, agreeable to a Fathers love,"
20272,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In both which we, as next participate."
20273,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20274,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man:  I know your friendly minds and--O what noise!
20275,SAMSON AGONISTES,Mercy of Heav'n what hideous noise was that!
20276,SAMSON AGONISTES,Horribly loud unlike the former shout.                             1510
20277,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20278,SAMSON AGONISTES,Chor:  Noise call you it or universal groan
20279,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As if the whole inhabitation perish'd,"
20280,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Blood, death, and deathful deeds are in that noise,"
20281,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Ruin, destruction at the utmost point."
20282,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20283,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man:  Of ruin indeed methought I heard the noise,"
20284,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Oh it continues, they have slain my Son."
20285,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20286,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  Thy Son is rather slaying them, that outcry"
20287,SAMSON AGONISTES,From slaughter of one foe could not ascend.
20288,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20289,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man:  Some dismal accident it needs must be;
20290,SAMSON AGONISTES,"What shall we do, stay here or run and see?                        1520"
20291,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20292,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  Best keep together here, lest running thither"
20293,SAMSON AGONISTES,We unawares run into dangers mouth.
20294,SAMSON AGONISTES,This evil on the Philistines is fall'n
20295,SAMSON AGONISTES,From whom could else a general cry be heard?
20296,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The sufferers then will scarce molest us here,"
20297,SAMSON AGONISTES,From other hands we need not much to fear.
20298,SAMSON AGONISTES,What if his eye-sight (for to Israels God
20299,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nothing is hard) by miracle restor'd,"
20300,SAMSON AGONISTES,"He now be dealing dole among his foes,"
20301,SAMSON AGONISTES,And over heaps of slaughter'd walk his way?                        1530
20302,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20303,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man:  That were a joy presumptuous to be thought.
20304,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20305,SAMSON AGONISTES,Chor:  Yet God hath wrought things as incredible
20306,SAMSON AGONISTES,For his people of old; what hinders now?
20307,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20308,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man:  He can I know, but doubt to think he will;"
20309,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Yet Hope would fain subscribe, and tempts Belief."
20310,SAMSON AGONISTES,A little stay will bring some notice hither.
20311,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20312,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  Of good or bad so great, of bad the sooner;"
20313,SAMSON AGONISTES,"For evil news rides post, while good news baits."
20314,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And to our wish I see one hither speeding,"
20315,SAMSON AGONISTES,"An Ebrew, as I guess, and of our Tribe.                            1540"
20316,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20317,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Mess:  O whither shall I run, or which way flie"
20318,SAMSON AGONISTES,The sight of this so horrid spectacle
20319,SAMSON AGONISTES,Which earst my eyes beheld and yet behold;
20320,SAMSON AGONISTES,For dire imagination still persues me.
20321,SAMSON AGONISTES,"But providence or instinct of nature seems,"
20322,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or reason though disturb'd, and scarse consulted"
20323,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To have guided me aright, I know not how,"
20324,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To thee first reverend Manoa, and to these"
20325,SAMSON AGONISTES,"My Countreymen, whom here I knew remaining,"
20326,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As at some distance from the place of horrour,                     1550"
20327,SAMSON AGONISTES,So in the sad event too much concern'd.
20328,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20329,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man:  The accident was loud, & here before thee"
20330,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With rueful cry, yet what it was we hear not,"
20331,SAMSON AGONISTES,"No Preface needs, thou seest we long to know."
20332,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20333,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Mess:  It would burst forth, but I recover breath"
20334,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And sense distract, to know well what I utter."
20335,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20336,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man:  Tell us the sum, the circumstance defer."
20337,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20338,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Mess:  Gaza yet stands, but all her Sons are fall'n,"
20339,SAMSON AGONISTES,All in a moment overwhelm'd and fall'n.
20340,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20341,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man: Sad, but thou knowst to Israelites not saddest                1560"
20342,SAMSON AGONISTES,The desolation of a Hostile City.
20343,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20344,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Mess:  Feed on that first, there may in grief be surfet."
20345,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20346,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man:  Relate by whom.
20347,SAMSON AGONISTES,Mess:  By Samson.
20348,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20349,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man:  That still lessens
20350,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The sorrow, and converts it nigh to joy."
20351,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20352,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Mess:  Ah Manoa I refrain, too suddenly"
20353,SAMSON AGONISTES,To utter what will come at last too soon;
20354,SAMSON AGONISTES,Lest evil tidings with too rude irruption
20355,SAMSON AGONISTES,Hitting thy aged ear should pierce too deep.
20356,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20357,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man:  Suspense in news is torture, speak them out."
20358,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20359,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Mess:  Then take the worst in brief, Samson is dead.               1570"
20360,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20361,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man:  The worst indeed, O all my hope's defeated"
20362,SAMSON AGONISTES,To free him hence! but death who sets all free
20363,SAMSON AGONISTES,Hath paid his ransom now and full discharge.
20364,SAMSON AGONISTES,What windy joy this day had I conceiv'd
20365,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Hopeful of his Delivery, which now proves"
20366,SAMSON AGONISTES,Abortive as the first-born bloom of spring
20367,SAMSON AGONISTES,Nipt with the lagging rear of winters frost.
20368,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Yet e're I give the rains to grief, say first,"
20369,SAMSON AGONISTES,How dy'd he? death to life is crown or shame.
20370,SAMSON AGONISTES,"All by him fell thou say'st, by whom fell he,                      1580"
20371,SAMSON AGONISTES,What glorious band gave Samson his deaths wound?
20372,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20373,SAMSON AGONISTES,Mess:  Unwounded of his enemies he fell.
20374,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20375,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man:  Wearied with slaughter then or how? explain.
20376,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20377,SAMSON AGONISTES,Mess: By his own hands.
20378,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man: Self-violence? what cause
20379,SAMSON AGONISTES,Brought him so soon at variance with himself
20380,SAMSON AGONISTES,Among his foes?
20381,SAMSON AGONISTES,Mess:  Inevitable cause
20382,SAMSON AGONISTES,At once both to destroy and be destroy'd;
20383,SAMSON AGONISTES,The Edifice where all were met to see him
20384,SAMSON AGONISTES,Upon thir heads and on his own he pull'd.
20385,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20386,SAMSON AGONISTES,Man:  O lastly over-strong against thy self!                       1590
20387,SAMSON AGONISTES,A dreadful way thou took'st to thy revenge.
20388,SAMSON AGONISTES,More than anough we know; but while things yet
20389,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Are in confusion, give us if thou canst,"
20390,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Eye-witness of what first or last was done,"
20391,SAMSON AGONISTES,Relation more particular and distinct.
20392,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20393,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Mess:  Occasions drew me early to this City,"
20394,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And as the gates I enter'd with Sun-rise,"
20395,SAMSON AGONISTES,The morning Trumpets Festival proclaim'd
20396,SAMSON AGONISTES,Through each high street: little I had dispatch't
20397,SAMSON AGONISTES,When all abroad was rumour'd that this day                         1600
20398,SAMSON AGONISTES,Samson should be brought forth to shew the people
20399,SAMSON AGONISTES,Proof of his mighty strength in feats and games;
20400,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I sorrow'd at his captive state, but minded"
20401,SAMSON AGONISTES,Not to be absent at that spectacle.
20402,SAMSON AGONISTES,The building was a spacious Theatre
20403,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Half round on two main Pillars vaulted high,"
20404,SAMSON AGONISTES,With seats where all the Lords and each degree
20405,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of sort, might sit in order to behold,"
20406,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The other side was op'n, where the throng"
20407,SAMSON AGONISTES,On banks and scaffolds under Skie might stand;                     1610
20408,SAMSON AGONISTES,I among these aloof obscurely stood.
20409,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The Feast and noon grew high, and Sacrifice"
20410,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Had fill'd thir hearts with mirth, high chear, & wine,"
20411,SAMSON AGONISTES,When to thir sports they turn'd.  Immediately
20412,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Was Samson as a public servant brought,"
20413,SAMSON AGONISTES,In thir state Livery clad; before him Pipes
20414,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And Timbrels, on each side went armed guards,"
20415,SAMSON AGONISTES,Both horse and foot before him and behind
20416,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Archers, and Slingers, Cataphracts and Spears."
20417,SAMSON AGONISTES,At sight of him the people with a shout                            1620
20418,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Rifted the Air clamouring thir god with praise,"
20419,SAMSON AGONISTES,Who had made thir dreadful enemy thir thrall.
20420,SAMSON AGONISTES,He patient but undaunted where they led him.
20421,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Came to the place, and what was set before him"
20422,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Which without help of eye, might be assay'd,"
20423,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To heave, pull, draw, or break, he still perform'd"
20424,SAMSON AGONISTES,"All with incredible, stupendious force,"
20425,SAMSON AGONISTES,None daring to appear Antagonist.
20426,SAMSON AGONISTES,At length for intermission sake they led him
20427,SAMSON AGONISTES,Between the pillars; he his guide requested                        1630
20428,SAMSON AGONISTES,(For so from such as nearer stood we heard)
20429,SAMSON AGONISTES,As over-tir'd to let him lean a while
20430,SAMSON AGONISTES,With both his arms on those two massie Pillars
20431,SAMSON AGONISTES,That to the arched roof gave main support.
20432,SAMSON AGONISTES,He unsuspitious led him; which when Samson
20433,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Felt in his arms, with head a while enclin'd,"
20434,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And eyes fast fixt he stood, as one who pray'd,"
20435,SAMSON AGONISTES,Or some great matter in his mind revolv'd.
20436,SAMSON AGONISTES,"At last with head erect thus cryed aloud,"
20437,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Hitherto, Lords, what your commands impos'd                        1640"
20438,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I have perform'd, as reason was, obeying,"
20439,SAMSON AGONISTES,Not without wonder or delight beheld.
20440,SAMSON AGONISTES,Now of my own accord such other tryal
20441,SAMSON AGONISTES,"I mean to shew you of my strength, yet greater;"
20442,SAMSON AGONISTES,As with amaze shall strike all who behold.
20443,SAMSON AGONISTES,"This utter'd, straining all his nerves he bow'd,"
20444,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As with the force of winds and waters pent,"
20445,SAMSON AGONISTES,"When Mountains tremble, those two massie Pillars"
20446,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With horrible convulsion to and fro,"
20447,SAMSON AGONISTES,"He tugg'd, he shook, till down they came and drew                  1650"
20448,SAMSON AGONISTES,"The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder"
20449,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Upon the heads of all who sate beneath,"
20450,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Lords, Ladies, Captains, Councellors, or Priests,"
20451,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thir choice nobility and flower, not only"
20452,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of this but each Philistian City round
20453,SAMSON AGONISTES,Met from all parts to solemnize this Feast.
20454,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Samson with these immixt, inevitably"
20455,SAMSON AGONISTES,Pulld down the same destruction on himself;
20456,SAMSON AGONISTES,The vulgar only scap'd who stood without.
20457,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20458,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  O dearly-bought revenge, yet glorious!                      1660"
20459,SAMSON AGONISTES,Living or dying thou hast fulfill'd
20460,SAMSON AGONISTES,The work for which thou wast foretold
20461,SAMSON AGONISTES,To Israel and now ly'st victorious
20462,SAMSON AGONISTES,Among thy slain self-kill'd
20463,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Not willingly, but tangl'd in the fold"
20464,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of dire necessity, whose law in death conjoin'd"
20465,SAMSON AGONISTES,Thee with thy slaughter'd foes in number more
20466,SAMSON AGONISTES,Then all thy life had slain before.
20467,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20468,SAMSON AGONISTES,Semichor:  While thir hearts were jocund and sublime
20469,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Drunk with Idolatry, drunk with Wine,                              1670"
20470,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And fat regorg'd of Bulls and Goats,"
20471,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chaunting thir Idol, and preferring"
20472,SAMSON AGONISTES,Before our living Dread who dwells
20473,SAMSON AGONISTES,In Silo his bright Sanctuary:
20474,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Among them he a spirit of phrenzie sent,"
20475,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Who hurt thir minds,"
20476,SAMSON AGONISTES,And urg'd them on with mad desire
20477,SAMSON AGONISTES,To call in hast for thir destroyer;
20478,SAMSON AGONISTES,They only set on sport and play
20479,SAMSON AGONISTES,Unweetingly importun'd                                             1680
20480,SAMSON AGONISTES,Thir own destruction to come speedy upon them.
20481,SAMSON AGONISTES,So fond are mortal men
20482,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Fall'n into wrath divine,"
20483,SAMSON AGONISTES,"As thir own ruin on themselves to invite,"
20484,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Insensate left, or to sense reprobate,"
20485,SAMSON AGONISTES,And with blindness internal struck.
20486,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20487,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Semichor:  But he though blind of sight,"
20488,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Despis'd and thought extinguish't quite,"
20489,SAMSON AGONISTES,With inward eyes illuminated
20490,SAMSON AGONISTES,His fierie vertue rouz'd                                           1690
20491,SAMSON AGONISTES,"From under ashes into sudden flame,"
20492,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And as an ev'ning Dragon came,"
20493,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Assailant on the perched roosts,"
20494,SAMSON AGONISTES,And nests in order rang'd
20495,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of tame villatic Fowl; but as an Eagle
20496,SAMSON AGONISTES,His cloudless thunder bolted on thir heads.
20497,SAMSON AGONISTES,"So vertue giv'n for lost,"
20498,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Deprest, and overthrown, as seem'd,"
20499,SAMSON AGONISTES,Like that self-begott'n bird
20500,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In the Arabian woods embost,                                       1700"
20501,SAMSON AGONISTES,"That no second knows nor third,"
20502,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And lay e're while a Holocaust,"
20503,SAMSON AGONISTES,From out her ashie womb now teem'd
20504,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Revives, reflourishes, then vigorous most"
20505,SAMSON AGONISTES,"When most unactive deem'd,"
20506,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And though her body die, her fame survives,"
20507,SAMSON AGONISTES,A secular bird ages of lives.
20508,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20509,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Man:  Come, come, no time for lamentation now,"
20510,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nor much more cause, Samson hath quit himself"
20511,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Like Samson, and heroicly hath finish'd                            1710"
20512,SAMSON AGONISTES,"A life Heroic, on his Enemies"
20513,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Fully reveng'd, hath left them years of mourning,"
20514,SAMSON AGONISTES,And lamentation to the Sons of Caphtor
20515,SAMSON AGONISTES,Through all Philistian bounds. To Israel
20516,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Honour hath left, and freedom, let but them"
20517,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Find courage to lay hold on this occasion,"
20518,SAMSON AGONISTES,To himself and Fathers house eternal fame;
20519,SAMSON AGONISTES,"And which is best and happiest yet, all this"
20520,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With God not parted from him, as was feard,"
20521,SAMSON AGONISTES,But favouring and assisting to the end.                            1720
20522,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail"
20523,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Or knock the breast, no weakness, no contempt,"
20524,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Dispraise, or blame, nothing but well and fair,"
20525,SAMSON AGONISTES,And what may quiet us in a death so noble.
20526,SAMSON AGONISTES,Let us go find the body where it lies
20527,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Sok't in his enemies blood, and from the stream"
20528,SAMSON AGONISTES,With lavers pure and cleansing herbs wash off
20529,SAMSON AGONISTES,The clotted gore.  I with what speed the while
20530,SAMSON AGONISTES,(Gaza is not in plight to say us nay)
20531,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Will send for all my kindred, all my friends                       1730"
20532,SAMSON AGONISTES,To fetch him hence and solemnly attend
20533,SAMSON AGONISTES,With silent obsequie and funeral train
20534,SAMSON AGONISTES,Home to his Fathers house: there will I build him
20535,SAMSON AGONISTES,"A Monument, and plant it round with shade"
20536,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of Laurel ever green, and branching Palm,"
20537,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With all his Trophies hung, and Acts enroll'd"
20538,SAMSON AGONISTES,"In copious Legend, or sweet Lyric Song."
20539,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Thither shall all the valiant youth resort,"
20540,SAMSON AGONISTES,And from his memory inflame thir breasts
20541,SAMSON AGONISTES,"To matchless valour, and adventures high:                          1740"
20542,SAMSON AGONISTES,The Virgins also shall on feastful days
20543,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Visit his Tomb with flowers, only bewailing"
20544,SAMSON AGONISTES,"His lot unfortunate in nuptial choice,"
20545,SAMSON AGONISTES,From whence captivity and loss of eyes.
20546,SAMSON AGONISTES,
20547,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Chor:  All is best, though we oft doubt,"
20548,SAMSON AGONISTES,What th' unsearchable dispose
20549,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Of highest wisdom brings about,"
20550,SAMSON AGONISTES,And ever best found in the close.
20551,SAMSON AGONISTES,"Oft he seems to hide his face,"
20552,SAMSON AGONISTES,But unexpectedly returns                                           1750
20553,SAMSON AGONISTES,And to his faithful Champion hath in place
20554,SAMSON AGONISTES,Bore witness gloriously; whence Gaza mourns
20555,SAMSON AGONISTES,And all that band them to resist
20556,SAMSON AGONISTES,"His uncontroulable intent,"
20557,SAMSON AGONISTES,His servants he with new acquist
20558,SAMSON AGONISTES,Of true experience from this great event
20559,SAMSON AGONISTES,"With peace and consolation hath dismist,"
20560,SAMSON AGONISTES,And calm of mind all passion spent.
