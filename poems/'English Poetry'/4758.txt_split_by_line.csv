42,APOLOGY,ABOUT half the verses that follow were written quite lately.  The rest
43,APOLOGY,"are older, having been held over in MS. when past volumes were published,"
44,APOLOGY,on considering that these would contain a sufficient number of pages to
45,APOLOGY,"offer readers at one time, more especially during the distractions of the"
46,APOLOGY,"war.  The unusually far back poems to be found here are, however, but"
47,APOLOGY,some that were overlooked in gathering previous collections.  A freshness
48,APOLOGY,"in them, now unattainable, seemed to make up for their inexperience and"
49,APOLOGY,to justify their inclusion.  A few are dated; the dates of others are not
50,APOLOGY,discoverable.
51,APOLOGY,
52,APOLOGY,The launching of a volume of this kind in neo-Georgian days by one who
53,APOLOGY,"began writing in mid-Victorian, and has published nothing to speak of for"
54,APOLOGY,"some years, may seem to call for a few words of excuse or explanation."
55,APOLOGY,"Whether or no, readers may feel assured that a new book is submitted to"
56,APOLOGY,them with great hesitation at so belated a date.  Insistent practical
57,APOLOGY,"reasons, however, among which were requests from some illustrious men of"
58,APOLOGY,"letters who are in sympathy with my productions, the accident that"
59,APOLOGY,"several of the poems have already seen the light, and that dozens of them"
60,APOLOGY,"have been lying about for years, compelled the course adopted, in spite"
61,APOLOGY,of the natural disinclination of a writer whose works have been so
62,APOLOGY,"frequently regarded askance by a pragmatic section here and there, to"
63,APOLOGY,draw attention to them once more.
64,APOLOGY,
65,APOLOGY,I do not know that it is necessary to say much on the contents of the
66,APOLOGY,"book, even in deference to suggestions that will be mentioned presently."
67,APOLOGY,I believe that those readers who care for my poems at all—readers to whom
68,APOLOGY,"no passport is required—will care for this new instalment of them,"
69,APOLOGY,"perhaps the last, as much as for any that have preceded them.  Moreover,"
70,APOLOGY,"in the eyes of a less friendly class the pieces, though a very mixed"
71,APOLOGY,"collection indeed, contain, so far as I am able to see, little or nothing"
72,APOLOGY,"in technic or teaching that can be considered a Star-Chamber matter, or"
73,APOLOGY,"so much as agitating to a ladies’ school; even though, to use"
74,APOLOGY,"Wordsworth’s observation in his Preface to _Lyrical Ballads_, such"
75,APOLOGY,readers may suppose “that by the act of writing in verse an author makes
76,APOLOGY,a formal engagement that he will gratify certain known habits of
77,APOLOGY,association: that he not only thus apprises the reader that certain
78,APOLOGY,"classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book, but that"
79,APOLOGY,others will be carefully excluded.”
80,APOLOGY,
81,APOLOGY,"It is true, nevertheless, that some grave, positive, stark, delineations"
82,APOLOGY,"are interspersed among those of the passive, lighter, and traditional"
83,APOLOGY,sort presumably nearer to stereotyped tastes.  For—while I am quite aware
84,APOLOGY,"that a thinker is not expected, and, indeed, is scarcely allowed, now"
85,APOLOGY,"more than heretofore, to state all that crosses his mind concerning"
86,APOLOGY,"existence in this universe, in his attempts to explain or excuse the"
87,APOLOGY,presence of evil and the incongruity of penalizing the irresponsible—it
88,APOLOGY,"must be obvious to open intelligences that, without denying the beauty"
89,APOLOGY,"and faithful service of certain venerable cults, such disallowance of"
90,APOLOGY,“obstinate questionings” and “blank misgivings” tends to a paralysed
91,APOLOGY,intellectual stalemate.  Heine observed nearly a hundred years ago that
92,APOLOGY,the soul has her eternal rights; that she will not be darkened by
93,APOLOGY,"statutes, nor lullabied by the music of bells.  And what is to-day, in"
94,APOLOGY,"allusions to the present author’s pages, alleged to be “pessimism” is, in"
95,APOLOGY,"truth, only such “questionings” in the exploration of reality, and is the"
96,APOLOGY,"first step towards the soul’s betterment, and the body’s also."
97,APOLOGY,
98,APOLOGY,"If I may be forgiven for quoting my own old words, let me repeat what I"
99,APOLOGY,"printed in this relation more than twenty years ago, and wrote much"
100,APOLOGY,"earlier, in a poem entitled “In Tenebris”:"
101,APOLOGY,
102,APOLOGY,"If way to the Better there be, it exacts a full look at the Worst:"
103,APOLOGY,
104,APOLOGY,"that is to say, by the exploration of reality, and its frank recognition"
105,APOLOGY,"stage by stage along the survey, with an eye to the best consummation"
106,APOLOGY,"possible: briefly, evolutionary meliorism.  But it is called pessimism"
107,APOLOGY,"nevertheless; under which word, expressed with condemnatory emphasis, it"
108,APOLOGY,is regarded by many as some pernicious new thing (though so old as to
109,APOLOGY,"underlie the Christian idea, and even to permeate the Greek drama); and"
110,APOLOGY,"the subject is charitably left to decent silence, as if further comment"
111,APOLOGY,were needless.
112,APOLOGY,
113,APOLOGY,"Happily there are some who feel such Levitical passing-by to be, alas, by"
114,APOLOGY,no means a permanent dismissal of the matter; that comment on where the
115,APOLOGY,world stands is very much the reverse of needless in these disordered
116,APOLOGY,years of our prematurely afflicted century: that amendment and not
117,APOLOGY,madness lies that way.  And looking down the future these few hold fast
118,APOLOGY,to the same: that whether the human and kindred animal races survive till
119,APOLOGY,"the exhaustion or destruction of the globe, or whether these races perish"
120,APOLOGY,"and are succeeded by others before that conclusion comes, pain to all"
121,APOLOGY,"upon it, tongued or dumb, shall be kept down to a minimum by"
122,APOLOGY,"lovingkindness, operating through scientific knowledge, and actuated by"
123,APOLOGY,the modicum of free will conjecturally possessed by organic life when the
124,APOLOGY,mighty necessitating forces—unconscious or other—that have “the
125,APOLOGY,"balancings of the clouds,” happen to be in equilibrium, which may or may"
126,APOLOGY,not be often.
127,APOLOGY,
128,APOLOGY,To conclude this question I may add that the argument of the so-called
129,APOLOGY,optimists is neatly summarized in a stern pronouncement against me by my
130,APOLOGY,"friend Mr. Frederic Harrison in a late essay of his, in the words: “This"
131,APOLOGY,view of life is not mine.”  The solemn declaration does not seem to me to
132,APOLOGY,be so annihilating to the said “view” (really a series of fugitive
133,APOLOGY,impressions which I have never tried to co-ordinate) as is complacently
134,APOLOGY,assumed.  Surely it embodies a too human fallacy quite familiar in logic.
135,APOLOGY,"Next, a knowing reviewer, apparently a Roman Catholic young man, speaks,"
136,APOLOGY,"with some rather gross instances of the _suggestio falsi_ in his article,"
137,APOLOGY,"of “Mr. Hardy refusing consolation,” the “dark gravity of his ideas,” and"
138,APOLOGY,so on.  When a Positivist and a Catholic agree there must be something
139,APOLOGY,"wonderful in it, which should make a poet sit up.  But . . . O that"
140,APOLOGY,’twere possible!
141,APOLOGY,
142,APOLOGY,I would not have alluded in this place or anywhere else to such casual
143,APOLOGY,personal criticisms—for casual and unreflecting they must be—but for the
144,APOLOGY,satisfaction of two or three friends in whose opinion a short answer was
145,APOLOGY,"deemed desirable, on account of the continual repetition of these"
146,APOLOGY,"criticisms, or more precisely, quizzings.  After all, the serious and"
147,APOLOGY,truly literary inquiry in this connection is: Should a shaper of such
148,APOLOGY,stuff as dreams are made on disregard considerations of what is customary
149,APOLOGY,"and expected, and apply himself to the real function of poetry, the"
150,APOLOGY,application of ideas to life (in Matthew Arnold’s familiar phrase)?  This
151,APOLOGY,bears more particularly on what has been called the “philosophy” of these
152,APOLOGY,poems—usually reproved as “queer.”  Whoever the author may be that
153,APOLOGY,undertakes such application of ideas in this “philosophic”
154,APOLOGY,direction—where it is specially required—glacial judgments must
155,APOLOGY,inevitably fall upon him amid opinion whose arbiters largely decry
156,APOLOGY,"individuality, to whom _ideas_ are oddities to smile at, who are moved by"
157,APOLOGY,a yearning the reverse of that of the Athenian inquirers on Mars Hill;
158,APOLOGY,"and stiffen their features not only at sound of a new thing, but at a"
159,APOLOGY,restatement of old things in new terms.  Hence should anything of this
160,APOLOGY,sort in the following adumbrations seem “queer”—should any of them seem
161,APOLOGY,to good Panglossians to embody strange and disrespectful conceptions of
162,APOLOGY,"this best of all possible worlds, I apologize; but cannot help it."
163,APOLOGY,
164,APOLOGY,"Such divergences, which, though piquant for the nonce, it would be"
165,APOLOGY,"affectation to say are not saddening and discouraging likewise, may, to"
166,APOLOGY,"be sure, arise sometimes from superficial aspect only, writer and reader"
167,APOLOGY,seeing the same thing at different angles.  But in palpable cases of
168,APOLOGY,"divergence they arise, as already said, whenever a serious effort is made"
169,APOLOGY,towards that which the authority I have cited—who would now be called
170,APOLOGY,"old-fashioned, possibly even parochial—affirmed to be what no good critic"
171,APOLOGY,"could deny as the poet’s province, the application of ideas to life.  One"
172,APOLOGY,"might shrewdly guess, by the by, that in such recommendation the famous"
173,APOLOGY,writer may have overlooked the cold-shouldering results upon an
174,APOLOGY,enthusiastic disciple that would be pretty certain to follow his putting
175,APOLOGY,"the high aim in practice, and have forgotten the disconcerting experience"
176,APOLOGY,of Gil Blas with the Archbishop.
177,APOLOGY,
178,APOLOGY,"To add a few more words to what has already taken up too many, there is a"
179,APOLOGY,contingency liable to miscellanies of verse that I have never seen
180,APOLOGY,"mentioned, so far as I can remember; I mean the chance little shocks that"
181,APOLOGY,may be caused over a book of various character like the present and its
182,APOLOGY,"predecessors by the juxtaposition of unrelated, even discordant,"
183,APOLOGY,"effusions; poems perhaps years apart in the making, yet facing each"
184,APOLOGY,other.  An odd result of this has been that dramatic anecdotes of a
185,APOLOGY,"satirical and humorous intention (such, _e.g._, as “Royal Sponsors”)"
186,APOLOGY,"following verse in graver voice, have been read as misfires because they"
187,APOLOGY,"raise the smile that they were intended to raise, the journalist, deaf to"
188,APOLOGY,"the sudden change of key, being unconscious that he is laughing with the"
189,APOLOGY,author and not at him.  I admit that I did not foresee such contingencies
190,APOLOGY,"as I ought to have done, and that people might not perceive when the tone"
191,APOLOGY,altered.  But the difficulties of arranging the themes in a graduated
192,APOLOGY,kinship of moods would have been so great that irrelation was almost
193,APOLOGY,unavoidable with efforts so diverse.  I must trust for right
194,APOLOGY,note-catching to those finely-touched spirits who can divine without half
195,APOLOGY,"a whisper, whose intuitiveness is proof against all the accidents of"
196,APOLOGY,"inconsequence.  In respect of the less alert, however, should any one’s"
197,APOLOGY,train of thought be thrown out of gear by a consecutive piping of vocal
198,APOLOGY,"reeds in jarring tonics, without a semiquaver’s rest between, and be led"
199,APOLOGY,thereby to miss the writer’s aim and meaning in one out of two contiguous
200,APOLOGY,"compositions, I shall deeply regret it."
201,APOLOGY,
202,APOLOGY,"Having at last, I think, finished with the personal points that I was"
203,APOLOGY,"recommended to notice, I will forsake the immediate object of this"
204,APOLOGY,"Preface; and, leaving _Late Lyrics_ to whatever fate it deserves, digress"
205,APOLOGY,for a few moments to more general considerations.  The thoughts of any
206,APOLOGY,man of letters concerned to keep poetry alive cannot but run
207,APOLOGY,uncomfortably on the precarious prospects of English verse at the present
208,APOLOGY,day.  Verily the hazards and casualties surrounding the birth and setting
209,APOLOGY,forth of almost every modern creation in numbers are ominously like those
210,APOLOGY,of one of Shelley’s paper-boats on a windy lake.  And a forward
211,APOLOGY,"conjecture scarcely permits the hope of a better time, unless men’s"
212,APOLOGY,"tendencies should change.  So indeed of all art, literature, and “high"
213,APOLOGY,thinking” nowadays.  Whether owing to the barbarizing of taste in the
214,APOLOGY,"younger minds by the dark madness of the late war, the unabashed"
215,APOLOGY,"cultivation of selfishness in all classes, the plethoric growth of"
216,APOLOGY,"knowledge simultaneously with the stunting of wisdom, “a degrading thirst"
217,APOLOGY,"after outrageous stimulation” (to quote Wordsworth again), or from any"
218,APOLOGY,"other cause, we seem threatened with a new Dark Age."
219,APOLOGY,
220,APOLOGY,"I formerly thought, like so many roughly handled writers, that so far as"
221,APOLOGY,literature was concerned a partial cause might be impotent or mischievous
222,APOLOGY,"criticism; the satirizing of individuality, the lack of whole-seeing in"
223,APOLOGY,"contemporary estimates of poetry and kindred work, the knowingness"
224,APOLOGY,"affected by junior reviewers, the overgrowth of meticulousness in their"
225,APOLOGY,"peerings for an opinion, as if it were a cultivated habit in them to"
226,APOLOGY,"scrutinize the tool-marks and be blind to the building, to hearken for"
227,APOLOGY,"the key-creaks and be deaf to the diapason, to judge the landscape by a"
228,APOLOGY,"nocturnal exploration with a flash-lantern.  In other words, to carry on"
229,APOLOGY,the old game of sampling the poem or drama by quoting the worst line or
230,APOLOGY,"worst passage only, in ignorance or not of Coleridge’s proof that a"
231,APOLOGY,versification of any length neither can be nor ought to be all poetry; of
232,APOLOGY,reading meanings into a book that its author never dreamt of writing
233,APOLOGY,there.  I might go on interminably.
234,APOLOGY,
235,APOLOGY,But I do not now think any such temporary obstructions to be the cause of
236,APOLOGY,"the hazard, for these negligences and ignorances, though they may have"
237,APOLOGY,"stifled a few true poets in the run of generations, disperse like"
238,APOLOGY,"stricken leaves before the wind of next week, and are no more heard of"
239,APOLOGY,again in the region of letters than their writers themselves.  No: we may
240,APOLOGY,be convinced that something of the deeper sort mentioned must be the
241,APOLOGY,cause.
242,APOLOGY,
243,APOLOGY,"In any event poetry, pure literature in general, religion—I include"
244,APOLOGY,"religion because poetry and religion touch each other, or rather modulate"
245,APOLOGY,"into each other; are, indeed, often but different names for the same"
246,APOLOGY,"thing—these, I say, the visible signs of mental and emotional life, must"
247,APOLOGY,"like all other things keep moving, becoming; even though at present, when"
248,APOLOGY,belief in witches of Endor is displacing the Darwinian theory and “the
249,APOLOGY,"truth that shall make you free,” men’s minds appear, as above noted, to"
250,APOLOGY,"be moving backwards rather than on.  I speak, of course, somewhat"
251,APOLOGY,"sweepingly, and should except many isolated minds; also the minds of men"
252,APOLOGY,"in certain worthy but small bodies of various denominations, and perhaps"
253,APOLOGY,in the homely quarter where advance might have been the very least
254,APOLOGY,expected a few years back—the English Church—if one reads it rightly as
255,APOLOGY,"showing evidence of “removing those things that are shaken,” in"
256,APOLOGY,accordance with the wise Epistolary recommendation to the Hebrews.  For
257,APOLOGY,since the historic and once august hierarchy of Rome some generation ago
258,APOLOGY,"lost its chance of being the religion of the future by doing otherwise,"
259,APOLOGY,and throwing over the little band of neo-Catholics who were making a
260,APOLOGY,struggle for continuity by applying the principle of evolution to their
261,APOLOGY,"own faith, joining hands with modern science, and outflanking the"
262,APOLOGY,hesitating English instinct towards liturgical reform (a flank march
263,APOLOGY,"which I at the time quite expected to witness, with the gathering of many"
264,APOLOGY,"millions of waiting agnostics into its fold); since then, one may ask,"
265,APOLOGY,"what other purely English establishment than the Church, of sufficient"
266,APOLOGY,"dignity and footing, and with such strength of old association, such"
267,APOLOGY,"architectural spell, is left in this country to keep the shreds of"
268,APOLOGY,morality together?
269,APOLOGY,
270,APOLOGY,"It may be a forlorn hope, a mere dream, that of an alliance between"
271,APOLOGY,"religion, which must be retained unless the world is to perish, and"
272,APOLOGY,"complete rationality, which must come, unless also the world is to"
273,APOLOGY,"perish, by means of the interfusing effect of poetry—“the breath and"
274,APOLOGY,"finer spirit of all knowledge; the impassioned expression of science,” as"
275,APOLOGY,it was defined by an English poet who was quite orthodox in his ideas.
276,APOLOGY,"But if it be true, as Comte argued, that advance is never in a straight"
277,APOLOGY,"line, but in a looped orbit, we may, in the aforesaid ominous moving"
278,APOLOGY,"backward, be doing it _pour mieux sauter_, drawing back for a spring.  I"
279,APOLOGY,"repeat that I forlornly hope so, notwithstanding the supercilious regard"
280,APOLOGY,"of hope by Schopenhauer, von Hartmann, and other philosophers down to"
281,APOLOGY,"Einstein who have my respect.  But one dares not prophesy.  Physical,"
282,APOLOGY,"chronological, and other contingencies keep me in these days from"
283,APOLOGY,critical studies and literary circles
284,APOLOGY,
285,APOLOGY,"Where once we held debate, a band"
286,APOLOGY,"Of youthful friends, on mind and art"
287,APOLOGY,
288,APOLOGY,(if one may quote Tennyson in this century of free verse).  Hence I
289,APOLOGY,"cannot know how things are going so well as I used to know them, and the"
290,APOLOGY,aforesaid limitations must quite prevent my knowing hence-forward.
291,APOLOGY,
292,APOLOGY,"I have to thank the editors and owners of _The Times_, _Fortnightly_,"
293,APOLOGY,"_Mercury_, and other periodicals in which a few of the poems have"
294,APOLOGY,appeared for kindly assenting to their being reclaimed for collected
295,APOLOGY,publication.

1076,A WOMAN’S FANCY,"Curious, she crept to his grave one evening,"
1077,A WOMAN’S FANCY,And a second time in the dusk of the morrow;
1078,A WOMAN’S FANCY,"Then a third time, with crescent emotion"
1079,A WOMAN’S FANCY,Like a bereaved wife’s sorrow.
1080,A WOMAN’S FANCY,
1081,A WOMAN’S FANCY,No gravestone rose by the rounded hillock;
1082,A WOMAN’S FANCY,—“I marvel why this is?” she said.
1083,A WOMAN’S FANCY,"—“He had no kindred, Ma’am, but you near.”"
1084,A WOMAN’S FANCY,—She set a stone at his head.
1085,A WOMAN’S FANCY,
1086,A WOMAN’S FANCY,"She learnt to dream of him, and told them:"
1087,A WOMAN’S FANCY,"“In slumber often uprises he,"
1088,A WOMAN’S FANCY,"And says: ‘I am joyed that, after all, Dear,"
1089,A WOMAN’S FANCY,You’ve not deserted me!”
1090,A WOMAN’S FANCY,
1091,A WOMAN’S FANCY,"At length died too this kinless woman,"
1092,A WOMAN’S FANCY,As he had died she had grown to crave;
1093,A WOMAN’S FANCY,And at her dying she besought them
1094,A WOMAN’S FANCY,To bury her in his grave.
1095,A WOMAN’S FANCY,
1096,A WOMAN’S FANCY,"Such said, she had paused; until she added:"

1099,A WOMAN’S FANCY,Not she who left him lone!”
1100,A WOMAN’S FANCY,

1813,THE WOMAN I MET,That winter night
1814,THE WOMAN I MET,By flaming jets of light.
1815,THE WOMAN I MET,
1816,THE WOMAN I MET,"She showed me Juans who feared their call-time,"
1817,THE WOMAN I MET,Guessing their lot;
1818,THE WOMAN I MET,"She showed me her sort that cursed their fall-time,"
1819,THE WOMAN I MET,And that did not.
1820,THE WOMAN I MET,"Till suddenly murmured she: “Now, tell me,"
1821,THE WOMAN I MET,"Why asked you never, ere death befell me,"
1822,THE WOMAN I MET,"To have my love,"

1825,THE WOMAN I MET,"I could not answer.  And she, well weeting"

1829,THE WOMAN I MET,Sighing and drawing her furs around her

2076,A WIFE COMES BACK,Of his life’s one day of dreamery.
2077,A WIFE COMES BACK,
2078,A WIFE COMES BACK,A woman came into his room
2079,A WIFE COMES BACK,Between the dawn and the creeping day:
2080,A WIFE COMES BACK,She was the years-wed wife from whom
2081,A WIFE COMES BACK,"He had parted, and who lived far away,"

2083,A WIFE COMES BACK,
2084,A WIFE COMES BACK,"He wondered, and as she stood"
2085,A WIFE COMES BACK,"She put on youth in her look and air,"
2086,A WIFE COMES BACK,And more was he wonderstruck as he viewed
2087,A WIFE COMES BACK,Her form and flesh bloom yet more fair
2088,A WIFE COMES BACK,While he watched her there;
2089,A WIFE COMES BACK,
2090,A WIFE COMES BACK,Till she freshed to the pink and brown
2091,A WIFE COMES BACK,"That were hers on the night when first they met,"
2092,A WIFE COMES BACK,When she was the charm of the idle town
2093,A WIFE COMES BACK,And he the pick of the club-fire set . . .
2094,A WIFE COMES BACK,"His eyes grew wet,"
2095,A WIFE COMES BACK,
2096,A WIFE COMES BACK,And he stretched his arms: “Stay—rest!—”
2097,A WIFE COMES BACK,"He cried.  “Abide with me so, my own!”"
2098,A WIFE COMES BACK,But his arms closed in on his hard bare breast;
2099,A WIFE COMES BACK,She had vanished with all he had looked upon
2100,A WIFE COMES BACK,Of her beauty: gone.
2101,A WIFE COMES BACK,
2102,A WIFE COMES BACK,"He clothed, and drew downstairs,"
2103,A WIFE COMES BACK,"But she was not in the house, he found;"
2104,A WIFE COMES BACK,And he passed out under the leafy pairs
2105,A WIFE COMES BACK,"Of the avenue elms, and searched around"
2106,A WIFE COMES BACK,To the park-pale bound.
2107,A WIFE COMES BACK,
2108,A WIFE COMES BACK,"He mounted, and rode till night"
2109,A WIFE COMES BACK,"To the city to which she had long withdrawn,"
2110,A WIFE COMES BACK,The vision he bore all day in his sight
2111,A WIFE COMES BACK,Being her young self as pondered on
2112,A WIFE COMES BACK,In the dim of dawn.
2113,A WIFE COMES BACK,
2114,A WIFE COMES BACK,“—The lady here long ago—
2115,A WIFE COMES BACK,Is she now here?—young—or such age as she is?”
2116,A WIFE COMES BACK,“—She is still here.”—“Thank God.  Let her know;

2118,A WIFE COMES BACK,Whom she’d fain not miss.”

2120,A WIFE COMES BACK,"She received him—an ancient dame,"
2121,A WIFE COMES BACK,"Who hemmed, with features frozen and numb,"

2237,I,On former eves ere I felt her tether.—
2238,I,Above the door of green by me
2239,I,"Was she, her casement seen by me;"
2240,I,But she would not heed
2241,I,What I melodied
2242,I,In my soul’s sore need—
2243,I,She would not heed.

2249,I,Only the curtains hid from her
2250,I,One whom caprice had bid from her;
2251,I,"But she did not come,"

2263,II,I hoped she would not come or know
2264,II,"That the house next door was the one now dittied,"
2265,II,"Not hers, as when I had played unpitied;"
2266,II,"—Next door, where dwelt a heart fresh stirred,"
2267,II,"My new Love, of good will to me,"
2268,II,"Unlike my old Love chill to me,"
2269,II,Who had not cared for my notes when heard:
2270,II,Yet that old Love came
2271,II,To the other’s name
2272,II,As hers were the claim;
2273,II,"Yea, the old Love came"
2274,II,
2275,II,"My viol sank mute, my tongue stood still,"
2276,II,"I tried to sing on, but vain my will:"
2277,II,"I prayed she would guess of the later, and leave me;"
2278,II,"She stayed, as though, were she slain by the smart,"
2279,II,She would bear love’s burn for a newer heart.
2280,II,The tense-drawn moment wrought to bereave me
2281,II,"Of voice, and I turned in a dumb despair"
2282,II,At her finding I’d come to another there.
2283,II,Sick I withdrew
2284,II,At love’s grim hue
2285,II,Ere my last Love knew;

3402,PENANCE,"By that harpsichord, built on the quaint old plan?"
3403,PENANCE,"—It is cold as a tomb,"

3409,PENANCE,"“Why do I?  Alas, far times ago"
3410,PENANCE,A woman lyred here

3412,PENANCE,From year to year;
3413,PENANCE,"And, in loneliness bending wistfully,"
3414,PENANCE,Would wake each note
3415,PENANCE,"In sick sad rote,"
3416,PENANCE,None to listen or see!

3463,AFTER THE WAR,“You’ll never come back;

3512,(A.D. 185–),
3513,(A.D. 185–),
3514,(A.D. 185–),"I’VE been thinking it through, as I play here to-night, to play never"
3515,(A.D. 185–),"again,"
3516,(A.D. 185–),"By the light of that lowering sun peering in at the window-pane,"
3517,(A.D. 185–),"And over the back-street roofs, throwing shades from the boys of the"
3518,(A.D. 185–),chore
3519,(A.D. 185–),"In the gallery, right upon me, sitting up to these keys once more . . ."
3520,(A.D. 185–),
3521,(A.D. 185–),"How I used to hear tongues ask, as I sat here when I was new:"
3522,(A.D. 185–),“Who is she playing the organ?  She touches it mightily true!”
3523,(A.D. 185–),"“She travels from Havenpool Town,” the deacon would softly speak,"
3524,(A.D. 185–),“The stipend can hardly cover her fare hither twice in the week.”
3525,(A.D. 185–),"(It fell far short of doing, indeed; but I never told,"
3526,(A.D. 185–),"For I have craved minstrelsy more than lovers, or beauty, or gold.)"
3527,(A.D. 185–),
3528,(A.D. 185–),"’Twas so he answered at first, but the story grew different later:"
3529,(A.D. 185–),"“It cannot go on much longer, from what we hear of her now!”"
3530,(A.D. 185–),At the meaning wheeze in the words the inquirer would shift his place
3531,(A.D. 185–),Till he could see round the curtain that screened me from people
3532,(A.D. 185–),below.
3533,(A.D. 185–),"“A handsome girl,” he would murmur, upstaring, (and so I am)."
3534,(A.D. 185–),"“But—too much sex in her build; fine eyes, but eyelids too heavy;"
3535,(A.D. 185–),A bosom too full for her age; in her lips too voluptuous a look.”
3536,(A.D. 185–),(It may be.  But who put it there?  Assuredly it was not I.)
3537,(A.D. 185–),
3538,(A.D. 185–),"I went on playing and singing when this I had heard, and more,"
3539,(A.D. 185–),"Though tears half-blinded me; yes, I remained going on and on,"
3540,(A.D. 185–),Just as I used me to chord and to sing at the selfsame time! . . .
3541,(A.D. 185–),For it’s a contralto—my voice is; they’ll hear it again here to-night
3542,(A.D. 185–),In the psalmody notes that I love more than world or than flesh or
3543,(A.D. 185–),than life.
3544,(A.D. 185–),
3545,(A.D. 185–),"Well, the deacon, in fact, that day had learnt new tidings about me;"
3546,(A.D. 185–),"They troubled his mind not a little, for he was a worthy man."
3547,(A.D. 185–),"(He trades as a chemist in High Street, and during the week he had"
3548,(A.D. 185–),sought
3549,(A.D. 185–),"His fellow-deacon, who throve as a book-binder over the way.)"
3550,(A.D. 185–),"“These are strange rumours,” he said.  “We must guard the good name of"
3551,(A.D. 185–),the chapel.
3552,(A.D. 185–),"If, sooth, she’s of evil report, what else can we do but dismiss her?”"
3553,(A.D. 185–),“—But get such another to play here we cannot for double the price!”
3554,(A.D. 185–),"It settled the point for the time, and I triumphed awhile in their"
3555,(A.D. 185–),"strait,"
3556,(A.D. 185–),And my much-beloved grand semibreves went living on under my fingers.
3557,(A.D. 185–),
3558,(A.D. 185–),"At length in the congregation more head-shakes and murmurs were rife,"
3559,(A.D. 185–),"And my dismissal was ruled, though I was not warned of it then."
3560,(A.D. 185–),But a day came when they declared it.  The news entered me as a sword;
3561,(A.D. 185–),"I was broken; so pallid of face that they thought I should faint, they"
3562,(A.D. 185–),said.
3563,(A.D. 185–),"I rallied.  “O, rather than go, I will play you for nothing!” said I."
3564,(A.D. 185–),"’Twas in much desperation I spoke it, for bring me to forfeit I could"
3565,(A.D. 185–),not
3566,(A.D. 185–),Those melodies chorded so richly for which I had laboured and lived.
3567,(A.D. 185–),They paused.  And for nothing I played at the chapel through Sundays
3568,(A.D. 185–),"anon,"
3569,(A.D. 185–),Upheld by that art which I loved more than blandishments lavished of
3570,(A.D. 185–),men.
3571,(A.D. 185–),
3572,(A.D. 185–),But it fell that murmurs again from the flock broke the pastor’s
3573,(A.D. 185–),peace.
3574,(A.D. 185–),"Some member had seen me at Havenpool, comrading close a sea-captain."
3575,(A.D. 185–),"(Yes; I was thereto constrained, lacking means for the fare to and"
3576,(A.D. 185–),fro.)
3577,(A.D. 185–),"Yet God knows, if aught He knows ever, I loved the Old-Hundredth,"
3578,(A.D. 185–),"Saint Stephen’s,"
3579,(A.D. 185–),"Mount Zion, New Sabbath, Miles-Lane, Holy Rest, and Arabia, and Eaton,"
3580,(A.D. 185–),Above all embraces of body by wooers who sought me and won! . . .
3581,(A.D. 185–),Next week ’twas declared I was seen coming home with a lover at dawn.
3582,(A.D. 185–),"The deacons insisted then, strong; and forgiveness I did not implore."
3583,(A.D. 185–),"I saw all was lost for me, quite, but I made a last bid in my throbs."
3584,(A.D. 185–),High love had been beaten by lust; and the senses had conquered the
3585,(A.D. 185–),"soul,"
3586,(A.D. 185–),"But the soul should die game, if I knew it!  I turned to my masters"
3587,(A.D. 185–),and said:
3588,(A.D. 185–),"“I yield, Gentlemen, without parlance.  But—let me just hymn you"
3589,(A.D. 185–),_once_ more!
3590,(A.D. 185–),"It’s a little thing, Sirs, that I ask; and a passion is music with"
3591,(A.D. 185–),me!”
3592,(A.D. 185–),"They saw that consent would cost nothing, and show as good grace, as"
3593,(A.D. 185–),"knew I,"
3594,(A.D. 185–),"Though tremble I did, and feel sick, as I paused thereat, dumb for"
3595,(A.D. 185–),their words.
3596,(A.D. 185–),"They gloomily nodded assent, saying, “Yes, if you care to.  Once more,"
3597,(A.D. 185–),"And only once more, understand.”  To that with a bend I agreed."
3598,(A.D. 185–),"—“You’ve a fixed and a far-reaching look,” spoke one who had eyed me"
3599,(A.D. 185–),awhile.
3600,(A.D. 185–),"“I’ve a fixed and a far-reaching plan, and my look only showed it,”"
3601,(A.D. 185–),said I.
3602,(A.D. 185–),
3603,(A.D. 185–),This evening of Sunday is come—the last of my functioning here.
3604,(A.D. 185–),"“She plays as if she were possessed!” they exclaim, glancing upward"
3605,(A.D. 185–),and round.
3606,(A.D. 185–),“Such harmonies I never dreamt the old instrument capable of!”
3607,(A.D. 185–),Meantime the sun lowers and goes; shades deepen; the lights are turned
3608,(A.D. 185–),"up,"
3609,(A.D. 185–),And the people voice out the last singing: tune Tallis: the Evening
3610,(A.D. 185–),Hymn.
3611,(A.D. 185–),(I wonder Dissenters sing Ken: it shows them more liberal in spirit
3612,(A.D. 185–),At this little chapel down here than at certain new others I know.)
3613,(A.D. 185–),I sing as I play.  Murmurs some one: “No woman’s throat richer than
3614,(A.D. 185–),hers!”
3615,(A.D. 185–),"“True: in these parts, at least,” ponder I.  “But, my man, you will"
3616,(A.D. 185–),hear it no more.”
3617,(A.D. 185–),And I sing with them onward: “The grave dread as little do I as my
3618,(A.D. 185–),bed.”
3619,(A.D. 185–),
3620,(A.D. 185–),"I lift up my feet from the pedals; and then, while my eyes are still"
3621,(A.D. 185–),wet
3622,(A.D. 185–),"From the symphonies born of my fingers, I do that whereon I am set,"
3623,(A.D. 185–),"And draw from my “full round bosom,” (their words; how can _I_ help"
3624,(A.D. 185–),its heave?)
3625,(A.D. 185–),"A bottle blue-coloured and fluted—a vinaigrette, they may conceive—"
3626,(A.D. 185–),"And before the choir measures my meaning, reads aught in my moves to"
3627,(A.D. 185–),"and fro,"
3628,(A.D. 185–),"I drink from the phial at a draught, and they think it a pick-me-up;"
3629,(A.D. 185–),so.
3630,(A.D. 185–),"Then I gather my books as to leave, bend over the keys as to pray."
3631,(A.D. 185–),"When they come to me motionless, stooping, quick death will have"
3632,(A.D. 185–),whisked me away.
3633,(A.D. 185–),
3634,(A.D. 185–),"“Sure, nobody meant her to poison herself in her haste, after all!”"
3635,(A.D. 185–),"The deacons will say as they carry me down and the night shadows fall,"
3636,(A.D. 185–),"“Though the charges were true,” they will add.  “It’s a case red as"
3637,(A.D. 185–),scarlet withal!”
3638,(A.D. 185–),I have never once minced it.  Lived chaste I have not.  Heaven knows
3639,(A.D. 185–),it above! . . .
3640,(A.D. 185–),But past all the heavings of passion—it’s music has been my life-love! . . .
3641,(A.D. 185–),That tune did go well—this last playing! . . . I reckon they’ll bury
3642,(A.D. 185–),me here . . .
3643,(A.D. 185–),"Not a soul from the seaport my birthplace—will come, or bestow me . . ."

3965,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,I SEE the ghost of a perished day;
3966,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"I know his face, and the feel of his dawn:"
3967,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,’Twas he who took me far away
3968,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,To a spot strange and gray:
3969,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"Look at me, Day, and then pass on,"
3970,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"But come again: yes, come anon!"
3971,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,
3972,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,Enters another into view;
3973,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"His features are not cold or white,"
3974,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,But rosy as a vein seen through:
3975,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,Too soon he smiles adieu.
3976,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"Adieu, O ghost-day of delight;"
3977,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,But come and grace my dying sight.
3978,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,
3979,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,Enters the day that brought the kiss:
3980,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,He brought it in his foggy hand
3981,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"To where the mumbling river is,"
3982,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,And the high clematis;
3983,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"It lent new colour to the land,"

3988,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"Even on a precinct common and tame,"
3989,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,As ’twere of purposed aim.
3990,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,He shows him as a rainbow sign

3992,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,
3993,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"The next stands forth in his morning clothes,"

3996,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"That joyous living loathes,"

3999,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,

4001,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,This next in train—who looks at me
4002,A PROCESSION OF DEAD DAYS,"As I were slave, and he were god"

4378,LONELY DAYS,Through the party-wall

5001,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"But the nor’-west wind a-blowing from the moor ath’art the river,"
5002,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),And the tree that taps the gurgoyle-head.”

5004,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"“Nay, husband, you perplex me; for if the noise I heard here,"

5006,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"The rain-fall, and the wind, and the tree-bough, and the river,"
5007,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),Why is it silent now?
5008,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),
5009,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"“And why is thy hand and thy clasping arm so shaking,"

5014,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"He lay there in silence for a while, still quickly breathing,"
5015,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),Then started up and walked about the room resentfully:
5016,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"“O woman, witch, whom I, in sooth, against my will have wedded,"
5017,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),Why castedst thou thy spells on me?
5018,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),
5019,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),“There was one I loved once: the cry you heard was her cry:
5020,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"She came to me to-night, and her plight was passing sore,"
5021,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"As no woman . . . Yea, and it was e’en the cry you heard, wife,"
5022,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),But she will cry no more!
5023,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),
5024,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"“And now I can’t abide thee: this place, it hath a curse on’t,"
5025,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),This farmstead once a castle: I’ll get me straight away!”
5026,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"He dressed this time in darkness, unspeaking, as she listened,"
5027,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),And went ere the dawn turned day.
5028,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),
5029,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"They found a woman’s body at a spot called Rocky Shallow,"
5030,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"Where the Froom stream curves amid the moorland, washed aground,"
5031,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"And they searched about for him, the yeoman, who had darkly known her,"
5032,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),But he could not be found.
5033,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),
5034,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"And the bride left for good-and-all the farmstead once a castle,"
5035,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"And in a county far away lives, mourns, and sleeps alone,"
5036,(WOODSFORD CASTLE: 17–),"And thinks in windy weather that she hears a woman crying,"

5382,THE CHOSEN,“A WOMAN for whom great gods might strive!”
5383,THE CHOSEN,"I said, and kissed her there:"
5384,THE CHOSEN,"And then I thought of the other five,"
5385,THE CHOSEN,And of how charms outwear.
5386,THE CHOSEN,
5387,THE CHOSEN,"I thought of the first with her eating eyes,"
5388,THE CHOSEN,"And I thought of the second with hers, green-gray,"
5389,THE CHOSEN,"And I thought of the third, experienced, wise,"
5390,THE CHOSEN,And I thought of the fourth who sang all day.
5391,THE CHOSEN,
5392,THE CHOSEN,"And I thought of the fifth, whom I’d called a jade,"
5393,THE CHOSEN,"And I thought of them all, tear-fraught;"
5394,THE CHOSEN,"And that each had shown her a passable maid,"
5395,THE CHOSEN,Yet not of the favour sought.
5396,THE CHOSEN,
5397,THE CHOSEN,"So I traced these words on the bark of a beech,"
5398,THE CHOSEN,Just at the falling of the mast:
5399,THE CHOSEN,"“After scanning five; yes, each and each,"
5400,THE CHOSEN,I’ve found the woman desired—at last!”
5401,THE CHOSEN,
5402,THE CHOSEN,"“—I feel a strange benumbing spell,"
5403,THE CHOSEN,As one ill-wished!” said she.
5404,THE CHOSEN,And soon it seemed that something fell
5405,THE CHOSEN,Was starving her love for me.
5406,THE CHOSEN,
5407,THE CHOSEN,"“I feel some curse.  O, _five_ were there?”"
5408,THE CHOSEN,"And wanly she swerved, and went away."
5409,THE CHOSEN,"I followed sick: night numbed the air,"
5410,THE CHOSEN,And dark the mournful moorland lay.
5411,THE CHOSEN,
5412,THE CHOSEN,"I cried: “O darling, turn your head!”"
5413,THE CHOSEN,But never her face I viewed;
5414,THE CHOSEN,"“O turn, O turn!” again I said,"
5415,THE CHOSEN,And miserably pursued.
5416,THE CHOSEN,
5417,THE CHOSEN,At length I came to a Christ-cross stone
5418,THE CHOSEN,Which she had passed without discern;
5419,THE CHOSEN,"And I knelt upon the leaves there strown,"
5420,THE CHOSEN,And prayed aloud that she might turn.
5421,THE CHOSEN,
5422,THE CHOSEN,"I rose, and looked; and turn she did;"
5423,THE CHOSEN,"I cried, “My heart revives!”"
5424,THE CHOSEN,"“Look more,” she said.  I looked as bid;"
5425,THE CHOSEN,Her face was all the five’s.
5426,THE CHOSEN,
5427,THE CHOSEN,"All the five women, clear come back,"
5428,THE CHOSEN,"I saw in her—with her made one,"
5429,THE CHOSEN,"The while she drooped upon the track,"
5430,THE CHOSEN,And her frail term seemed well-nigh run.
5431,THE CHOSEN,
5432,THE CHOSEN,She’d half forgot me in her change;
5433,THE CHOSEN,“Who are you?  Won’t you say
5434,THE CHOSEN,"Who you may be, you man so strange,"
5435,THE CHOSEN,Following since yesterday?”
5436,THE CHOSEN,
5437,THE CHOSEN,"I took the composite form she was,"
5438,THE CHOSEN,"And carried her to an arbour small,"
5439,THE CHOSEN,"Not passion-moved, but even because"
5440,THE CHOSEN,In one I could atone to all.
5441,THE CHOSEN,
5442,THE CHOSEN,"And there she lies, and there I tend,"
5443,THE CHOSEN,"Till my life’s threads unwind,"

5455,(A TALE),"Like a soul that could meet no more the sight of the sun,"
5456,(A TALE),"Inclined her in weepings and prayings continually,"
5457,(A TALE),As his widowed one.
5458,(A TALE),
5459,(A TALE),"And to pleasure her in her sorrow, and fix his name"
5460,(A TALE),"As a memory Time’s fierce frost should never kill,"
5461,(A TALE),"She caused to be richly chased a brass to his fame,"
5462,(A TALE),Which should link them still;
5463,(A TALE),
5464,(A TALE),"For she bonded her name with his own on the brazen page,"
5465,(A TALE),"As if dead and interred there with him, and cold, and numb,"
5466,(A TALE),(Omitting the day of her dying and year of her age
5467,(A TALE),Till her end should come;)
5468,(A TALE),
5469,(A TALE),And implored good people to pray “Of their Charytie
5470,(A TALE),"For these twaine Soules,”—yea, she who did last remain"
5471,(A TALE),Forgoing Heaven’s bliss if ever with spouse should she
5472,(A TALE),Again have lain.
5473,(A TALE),
5474,(A TALE),"Even there, as it first was set, you may see it now,"
5475,(A TALE),"Writ in quaint Church text, with the date of her death left bare,"
5476,(A TALE),"In the aged Estminster aisle, where the folk yet bow"
5477,(A TALE),Themselves in prayer.
5478,(A TALE),
5479,(A TALE),"Thereafter some years slid, till there came a day"
5480,(A TALE),When it slowly began to be marked of the standers-by
5481,(A TALE),"That she would regard the brass, and would bend away"
5482,(A TALE),With a drooping sigh.
5483,(A TALE),
5484,(A TALE),Now the lady was fair as any the eye might scan
5485,(A TALE),Through a summer day of roving—a type at whose lip
5486,(A TALE),"Despite her maturing seasons, no meet man"
5487,(A TALE),Would be loth to sip.
5488,(A TALE),
5489,(A TALE),And her heart was stirred with a lightning love to its pith
5490,(A TALE),"For a newcomer who, while less in years, was one"
5491,(A TALE),"Full eager and able to make her his own forthwith,"
5492,(A TALE),Restrained of none.
5493,(A TALE),
5494,(A TALE),"But she answered Nay, death-white; and still as he urged"
5495,(A TALE),"She adversely spake, overmuch as she loved the while,"
5496,(A TALE),"Till he pressed for why, and she led with the face of one scourged"
5497,(A TALE),"To the neighbouring aisle,"
5498,(A TALE),
5499,(A TALE),"And showed him the words, ever gleaming upon her pew,"
5500,(A TALE),"Memorizing her there as the knight’s eternal wife,"
5501,(A TALE),"Or falsing such, debarred inheritance due"
5502,(A TALE),Of celestial life.
5503,(A TALE),
5504,(A TALE),"He blenched, and reproached her that one yet undeceased"
5505,(A TALE),Should bury her future—that future which none can spell;
5506,(A TALE),"And she wept, and purposed anon to inquire of the priest"
5507,(A TALE),If the price were hell
5508,(A TALE),
5509,(A TALE),"Of her wedding in face of the record.  Her lover agreed,"
5510,(A TALE),"And they parted before the brass with a shudderful kiss,"
5511,(A TALE),"For it seemed to flash out on their impulse of passionate need,"
5512,(A TALE),“Mock ye not this!”
5513,(A TALE),
5514,(A TALE),"Well, the priest, whom more perceptions moved than one,"
5515,(A TALE),Said she erred at the first to have written as if she were dead
5516,(A TALE),Her name and adjuration; but since it was done
5517,(A TALE),Nought could be said
5518,(A TALE),
5519,(A TALE),"Save that she must abide by the pledge, for the peace of her soul,"
5520,(A TALE),"And so, by her life, maintain the apostrophe good,"
5521,(A TALE),If she wished anon to reach the coveted goal
5522,(A TALE),Of beatitude.
5523,(A TALE),
5524,(A TALE),To erase from the consecrate text her prayer as there prayed
5525,(A TALE),"Would aver that, since earth’s joys most drew her, past doubt,"
5526,(A TALE),Friends’ prayers for her joy above by Jesu’s aid
5527,(A TALE),Could be done without.
5528,(A TALE),
5529,(A TALE),"Moreover she thought of the laughter, the shrug, the jibe"
5530,(A TALE),That would rise at her back in the nave when she should pass
5531,(A TALE),As another’s avowed by the words she had chosen to inscribe
5532,(A TALE),On the changeless brass.
5533,(A TALE),
5534,(A TALE),"And so for months she replied to her Love: “No, no”;"
5535,(A TALE),"While sorrow was gnawing her beauties ever and more,"
5536,(A TALE),"Till he, long-suffering and weary, grew to show"
5537,(A TALE),Less warmth than before.
5538,(A TALE),
5539,(A TALE),"And, after an absence, wrote words absolute:"
5540,(A TALE),That he gave her till Midsummer morn to make her mind clear;
5541,(A TALE),"And that if, by then, she had not said Yea to his suit,"
5542,(A TALE),He should wed elsewhere.
5543,(A TALE),
5544,(A TALE),"Thence on, at unwonted times through the lengthening days"
5545,(A TALE),"She was seen in the church—at dawn, or when the sun dipt"
5546,(A TALE),"And the moon rose, standing with hands joined, blank of gaze,"
5547,(A TALE),Before the script.
5548,(A TALE),
5549,(A TALE),She thinned as he came not; shrank like a creature that cowers
5550,(A TALE),"As summer drew nearer; but still had not promised to wed,"
5551,(A TALE),"When, just at the zenith of June, in the still night hours,"
5552,(A TALE),She was missed from her bed.
5553,(A TALE),
5554,(A TALE),“The church!” they whispered with qualms; “where often she sits.”
5555,(A TALE),"They found her: facing the brass there, else seeing none,"
5556,(A TALE),"But feeling the words with her finger, gibbering in fits;"
5557,(A TALE),And she knew them not one.
5558,(A TALE),
5559,(A TALE),"And so she remained, in her handmaids’ charge; late, soon,"
5560,(A TALE),"Tracing words in the air with her finger, as seen that night—"
5561,(A TALE),"Those incised on the brass—till at length unwatched one noon,"
5562,(A TALE),She vanished from sight.
5563,(A TALE),
5564,(A TALE),"And, as talebearers tell, thence on to her last-taken breath"
5565,(A TALE),"Was unseen, save as wraith that in front of the brass made moan;"
5566,(A TALE),So that ever the way of her life and the time of her death
5567,(A TALE),Remained unknown.
5568,(A TALE),
5569,(A TALE),"And hence, as indited above, you may read even now"
5570,(A TALE),"The quaint church-text, with the date of her death left bare,"

5861,THE SEVEN TIMES,Who trotted by me with uncertain air;
5862,THE SEVEN TIMES,"“I’ll tell my tale,” he murmured, “for I fancy"
5863,THE SEVEN TIMES,A friend goes there? . . . ”
5864,THE SEVEN TIMES,
5865,THE SEVEN TIMES,Then thus he told.  “I reached—’twas for the first time—
5866,THE SEVEN TIMES,A dwelling.  Life was clogged in me with care;
5867,THE SEVEN TIMES,"I thought not I should meet an eyesome maiden,"
5868,THE SEVEN TIMES,But found one there.

5872,THE SEVEN TIMES,"I slackened in my footsteps at the porchway,"
5873,THE SEVEN TIMES,And found her there.
5874,THE SEVEN TIMES,
5875,THE SEVEN TIMES,"“I rose and travelled thither for the third time,"
5876,THE SEVEN TIMES,The hope-hues growing gayer and yet gayer
5877,THE SEVEN TIMES,"As I hastened round the boscage of the outskirts,"
5878,THE SEVEN TIMES,And found her there.
5879,THE SEVEN TIMES,
5880,THE SEVEN TIMES,“I journeyed to the place again the fourth time
5881,THE SEVEN TIMES,"(The best and rarest visit of the rare,"
5882,THE SEVEN TIMES,"As it seemed to me, engrossed about these goings),"
5883,THE SEVEN TIMES,And found her there.
5884,THE SEVEN TIMES,
5885,THE SEVEN TIMES,“When I bent me to my pilgrimage the fifth time
5886,THE SEVEN TIMES,(Soft-thinking as I journeyed I would dare
5887,THE SEVEN TIMES,"A certain word at token of good auspice),"
5888,THE SEVEN TIMES,I found her there.
5889,THE SEVEN TIMES,
5890,THE SEVEN TIMES,"“That landscape did I traverse for the sixth time,"
5891,THE SEVEN TIMES,And dreamed on what we purposed to prepare;
5892,THE SEVEN TIMES,"I reached a tryst before my journey’s end came,"
5893,THE SEVEN TIMES,And found her there.
5894,THE SEVEN TIMES,
5895,THE SEVEN TIMES,"“I went again—long after—aye, the seventh time;"
5896,THE SEVEN TIMES,The look of things was sinister and bare
5897,THE SEVEN TIMES,"As I caught no customed signal, heard no voice call,"
5898,THE SEVEN TIMES,Nor found her there.
5899,THE SEVEN TIMES,
5900,THE SEVEN TIMES,"“And now I gad the globe—day, night, and any time,"
5901,THE SEVEN TIMES,"To light upon her hiding unaware,"
5902,THE SEVEN TIMES,"And, maybe, I shall nigh me to some nymph-niche,"
5903,THE SEVEN TIMES,And find her there!”
5904,THE SEVEN TIMES,
5905,THE SEVEN TIMES,"“But how,” said I, “has your so little lifetime"
5906,THE SEVEN TIMES,"Given roomage for such loving, loss, despair?"
5907,THE SEVEN TIMES,A boy so young!”  Forthwith I turned my lantern
5908,THE SEVEN TIMES,Upon him there.
5909,THE SEVEN TIMES,
5910,THE SEVEN TIMES,"His head was white.  His small form, fine aforetime,"
5911,THE SEVEN TIMES,"Was shrunken with old age and battering wear,"
5912,THE SEVEN TIMES,An eighty-years long plodder saw I pacing
