125,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"ERNEST DOWSON was born in 1867 at Lea, in Kent, England. Most of his"
126,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"life was spent in France. He died February 21, 1900."

128,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,The poems in this volume were published at varying intervals from his
129,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,Oxford days at Queens College to the time of his death. The prose
130,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"works here included were published in 1886, 1890, 1892 and in 1893."

139,I,
140,I,The death of Ernest Dowson will mean very little to the world at
141,I,"large, but it will mean a great deal to the few people who care"
142,I,"passionately for poetry. A little book of verses, the manuscript of"
143,I,"another, a one-act play in verse, a few short stories, two novels"
144,I,"written in collaboration, some translations from the French, done for"
145,I,money; that is all that was left by a man who was undoubtedly a man of
146,I,"genius, not a great poet, but a poet, one of the very few writers of"
147,I,our generation to whom that name can be applied in its most intimate
148,I,"sense. People will complain, probably, in his verses, of what will"
149,I,"seem to them the factitious melancholy, the factitious idealism, and"
150,I,(peeping through at a few rare moments) the factitious suggestions of
151,I,"riot. They will see only a literary affectation, where in truth there"
152,I,is as genuine a note of personal sincerity as in the more explicit and
153,I,"arranged confessions of less admirable poets. Yes, in these few"
154,I,"evasive, immaterial snatches of song, I find, implied for the most"
155,I,"part, hidden away like a secret, all the fever and turmoil and the"
156,I,"unattained dreams of a life which had itself so much of the swift,"
157,I,"disastrous, and suicidal impetus of genius."
158,I,
159,I,"Ernest Christopher Dowson was born at The Grove, Belmont Hill, Lee,"
160,I,"Kent, on August 2nd, 1867; he died at 26 Sandhurst Gardens, Catford,"
161,I,"S.E., on Friday morning, February 23, 1900, and was buried in the"
162,I,Roman Catholic part of the Lewisham Cemetery on February 27. His
163,I,"great-uncle was Alfred Domett, Browning's ""Waring,"" at one time Prime"
164,I,"Minister of New Zealand, and author of ""Ranolf and Amohia,"" and other"
165,I,"poems. His father, who had himself a taste for literature, lived a"
166,I,"good deal in France and on the Riviera, on account of the delicacy of"
167,I,"his health, and Ernest had a somewhat irregular education, chiefly out"
168,I,"of England, before he entered Queen's College, Oxford. He left in 1887"
169,I,"without taking a degree, and came to London, where he lived for"
170,I,"several years, often revisiting France, which was always his favourite"
171,I,"country. Latterly, until the last year of his life, he lived almost"
172,I,"entirely in Paris, Brittany, and Normandy. Never robust, and always"
173,I,"reckless with himself, his health had been steadily getting worse for"
174,I,"some years, and when he came back to London he looked, as indeed he"
175,I,"was, a dying man. Morbidly shy, with a sensitive independence which"
176,I,"shrank from any sort of obligation, he would not communicate with his"
177,I,"relatives, who would gladly have helped him, or with any of the really"
178,I,"large number of attached friends whom he had in London; and, as his"
179,I,"disease weakened him more and more, he hid himself away in his"
180,I,"miserable lodgings, refused to see a doctor, let himself half starve,"
181,I,and was found one day in a Bodega with only a few shillings in his
182,I,"pocket, and so weak as to be hardly able to walk, by a friend, himself"
183,I,"in some difficulties, who immediately took him back to the"
184,I,"bricklayer's cottage in a muddy outskirt of Catford, where he was"
185,I,"himself living, and there generously looked after him for the last six"
186,I,weeks of his life.
187,I,
188,I,He did not realise that he was going to die; and was full of projects
189,I,"for the future, when the £600 which was to come to him from the sale"
190,I,of some property should have given him a fresh chance in the world;
191,I,"began to read Dickens, whom he had never read before, with singular"
192,I,"zest; and, on the last day of his life, sat up talking eagerly till"
193,I,five in the morning. At the very moment of his death he did not know
194,I,"that he was dying. He tried to cough, could not cough, and the heart"
195,I,quietly stopped.
196,I,
197,I,
198,II,II
199,II,
200,II,I cannot remember my first meeting with Ernest Dowson. It may have
201,II,"been in 1891, at one of the meetings of the Rhymers' Club, in an upper"
202,II,"room of the ""Cheshire Cheese,"" where long clay pipes lay in slim heaps"
203,II,"on the wooden tables, between tankards of ale; and young poets, then"
204,II,"very young, recited their own verses to one another with a desperate"
205,II,and ineffectual attempt to get into key with the Latin Quarter. Though
206,II,"few of us were, as a matter of fact, Anglo-Saxon, we could not help"
207,II,"feeling that we were in London, and the atmosphere of London is not"
208,II,the atmosphere of movements or of societies. In Paris it is the most
209,II,"natural thing in the world to meet and discuss literature, ideas,"
210,II,one's own and one another's work; and it can be done without
211,II,"pretentiousness or constraint, because, to the Latin mind, art, ideas,"
212,II,"one's work and the work of one's friends, are definite and important"
213,II,"things, which it would never occur to any one to take anything but"
214,II,seriously. In England art has to be protected not only against the
215,II,"world, but against one's self and one's fellow artist, by a kind of"
216,II,"affected modesty which is the Englishman's natural pose, half pride"
217,II,"and half self-distrust. So this brave venture of the Rhymers' Club,"
218,II,"though it lasted for two or three years, and produced two little books"
219,II,"of verse which will some day be literary curiosities, was not quite a"
220,II,"satisfactory kind of _cénacle_. Dowson, who enjoyed the real thing so"
221,II,"much in Paris, did not, I think, go very often; but his contributions"
222,II,to the first book of the club were at once the most delicate and the
223,II,"most distinguished poems which it contained. Was it, after all, at one"
224,II,"of these meetings that I first saw him, or was it, perhaps, at another"
225,II,"haunt of some of us at that time, a semi-literary tavern near"
226,II,"Leicester Square, chosen for its convenient position between two"
227,II,stage-doors? It was at the time when one or two of us sincerely
228,II,"worshipped the ballet; Dowson, alas! never. I could never get him to"
229,II,"see that charm in harmonious and coloured movement, like bright"
230,II,"shadows seen through the floating gauze of the music, which held me"
231,II,night after night at the two theatres which alone seemed to me to give
232,II,an amusing colour to one's dreams. Neither the stage nor the
233,II,stage-door had any attraction for him; but he came to the tavern
234,II,"because it was a tavern, and because he could meet his friends there."
235,II,"Even before that time I have a vague impression of having met him, I"
236,II,"forget where, certainly at night; and of having been struck, even"
237,II,"then, by a look and manner of pathetic charm, a sort of Keats-like"
238,II,"face, the face of a demoralised Keats, and by something curious in the"
239,II,"contrast of a manner exquisitely refined, with an appearance generally"
240,II,"somewhat dilapidated. That impression was only accentuated later on,"
241,II,"when I came to know him, and the manner of his life, much more"
242,II,intimately.
243,II,
244,II,"I think I may date my first impression of what one calls ""the real"
245,II,"man"" (as if it were more real than the poet of the disembodied"
246,II,verses!) from an evening in which he first introduced me to those
247,II,"charming supper-houses, open all night through, the cabmen's shelters."
248,II,"I had been talking over another vagabond poet, Lord Rochester, with a"
249,II,"charming and sympathetic descendant of that poet, and somewhat late at"
250,II,night we had come upon Dowson and another man wandering aimlessly and
251,II,"excitedly about the streets. He invited us to supper, we did not quite"
252,II,"realise where, and the cabman came in with us, as we were welcomed,"
253,II,"cordially and without comment, at a little place near the Langham;"
254,II,"and, I recollect, very hospitably entertained. The cooking differs, as"
255,II,"I found in time, in these supper-houses, but there the rasher was"
256,II,"excellent and the cups admirably clean. Dowson was known there, and I"
257,II,used to think he was always at his best in a cabmen's shelter. Without
258,II,a certain sordidness in his surroundings he was never quite
259,II,"comfortable, never quite himself; and at those places you are obliged"
260,II,to drink nothing stronger than coffee or tea. I liked to see him
261,II,"occasionally, for a change, drinking nothing stronger than coffee or"
262,II,"tea. At Oxford, I believe, his favourite form of intoxication had been"
263,II,haschisch; afterwards he gave up this somewhat elaborate experiment in
264,II,visionary sensations for readier means of oblivion; but he returned to
265,II,"it, I remember, for at least one afternoon, in a company of which I"
266,II,had been the gatherer and of which I was the host. I remember him
267,II,"sitting a little anxiously, with his chin on his breast, awaiting the"
268,II,"magic, half-shy in the midst of a bright company of young people whom"
269,II,he had only seen across the footlights. The experience was not a very
270,II,"successful one; it ended in what should have been its first symptom,"
271,II,immoderate laughter.
272,II,
273,II,"Always, perhaps, a little consciously, but at least always sincerely,"
274,II,"in search of new sensations, my friend found what was for him the"
275,II,supreme sensation in a very passionate and tender adoration of the
276,II,"most escaping of all ideals, the ideal of youth. Cherished, as I"
277,II,"imagine, first only in the abstract, this search after the immature,"
278,II,"the ripening graces which time can only spoil in the ripening, found"
279,II,"itself at the journey's end, as some of his friends thought, a little"
280,II,"prematurely. I was never of their opinion. I only saw twice, and for a"
281,II,"few moments only, the young girl to whom most of his verses were to be"
282,II,"written, and whose presence in his life may be held to account for"
283,II,much of that astonishing contrast between the broad outlines of his
284,II,life and work. The situation seemed to me of the most exquisite and
285,II,"appropriate impossibility. The daughter of a refugee, I believe of"
286,II,"good family, reduced to keeping a humble restaurant in a foreign"
287,II,"quarter of London, she listened to his verses, smiled charmingly,"
288,II,"under her mother's eyes, on his two years' courtship, and at the end"
289,II,of two years married the waiter instead. Did she ever realise more
290,II,"than the obvious part of what was being offered to her, in this shy"
291,II,and eager devotion? Did it ever mean very much to her to have made and
292,II,"to have killed a poet? She had, at all events, the gift of evoking,"
293,II,"and, in its way, of retaining, all that was most delicate, sensitive,"
294,II,"shy, typically poetic, in a nature which I can only compare to a weedy"
295,II,"garden, its grass trodden down by many feet, but with one small,"
296,II,"carefully tended flowerbed, luminous with lilies. I used to think,"
297,II,"sometimes, of Verlaine and his ""girl-wife,"" the one really profound"
298,II,"passion, certainly, of that passionate career; the charming,"
299,II,"child-like creature, to whom he looked back, at the end of his life,"
300,II,"with an unchanged tenderness and disappointment: ""Vous n'avez rien"
301,II,"compris à ma simplicité,"" as he lamented. In the case of Dowson,"
302,II,"however, there was a sort of virginal devotion, as to a Madonna; and I"
303,II,"think, had things gone happily, to a conventionally happy ending, he"
304,II,would have felt (dare I say?) that his ideal had been spoilt.
305,II,
306,II,"But, for the good fortune of poets, things rarely do go happily with"
307,II,"them, or to conventionally happy endings. He used to dine every night"
308,II,"at the little restaurant, and I can always see the picture, which I"
309,II,have so often seen through the window in passing: the narrow room with
310,II,"the rough tables, for the most part empty, except in the innermost"
311,II,"corner, where Dowson would sit with that singularly sweet and"
312,II,singularly pathetic smile on his lips (a smile which seemed afraid of
313,II,"its right to be there, as if always dreading a rebuff), playing his"
314,II,invariable after-dinner game of cards. Friends would come in during
315,II,"the hour before closing time; and the girl, her game of cards"
316,II,"finished, would quietly disappear, leaving him with hardly more than"
317,II,the desire to kill another night as swiftly as possible.
318,II,
319,II,Meanwhile she and the mother knew that the fragile young man who dined
320,II,there so quietly every day was apt to be quite another sort of person
321,II,after he had been three hours outside. It was only when his life
322,II,seemed to have been irretrievably ruined that Dowson quite
323,II,"deliberately abandoned himself to that craving for drink, which was"
324,II,"doubtless lying in wait for him in his blood, as consumption was also;"
325,II,"it was only latterly, when he had no longer any interest in life, that"
326,II,he really wished to die. But I have never known him when he could
327,II,"resist either the desire or the consequences of drink. Sober, he was"
328,II,"the most gentle, in manner the most gentlemanly of men; unselfish to a"
329,II,"fault, to the extent of weakness; a delightful companion, charm"
330,II,"itself. Under the influence of drink, he became almost literally"
331,II,"insane, certainly quite irresponsible. He fell into furious and"
332,II,unreasoning passions; a vocabulary unknown to him at other times
333,II,sprang up like a whirlwind; he seemed always about to commit some act
334,II,of absurd violence. Along with that forgetfulness came other memories.
335,II,"As long as he was conscious of himself, there was but one woman for"
336,II,"him in the world, and for her he had an infinite tenderness and an"
337,II,"infinite respect. When that face faded from him, he saw all the other"
338,II,"faces, and he saw no more difference than between sheep and sheep."
339,II,"Indeed, that curious love of the sordid, so common an affectation of"
340,II,"the modern decadent, and with him so genuine, grew upon him, and"
341,II,dragged him into more and more sorry corners of a life which was never
342,II,"exactly ""gay"" to him. His father, when he died, left him in possession"
343,II,"of an old dock, where for a time he lived in a mouldering house, in"
344,II,"that squalid part of the East End which he came to know so well, and"
345,II,to feel so strangely at home in. He drank the poisonous liquors of
346,II,those pot-houses which swarm about the docks; he drifted about in
347,II,whatever company came in his way; he let heedlessness develop into a
348,II,"curious disregard of personal tidiness. In Paris, Les Halles took the"
349,II,"place of the docks. At Dieppe, where I saw so much, of him one summer,"
350,II,"he discovered strange, squalid haunts about the harbour, where he made"
351,II,"friends with amazing innkeepers, and got into rows with the fishermen"
352,II,"who came in to drink after midnight. At Brussels, where I was with him"
353,II,"at the time of the Kermesse, he flung himself into all that riotous"
354,II,"Flemish life, with a zest for what was most sordidly riotous in it. It"
355,II,was his own way of escape from life.
356,II,
357,II,"To Dowson, as to all those who have not been ""content to ask unlikely"
358,II,"gifts in vain,"" nature, life, destiny, whatever one chooses to call"
359,II,"it, that power which is strength to the strong, presented itself as a"
360,II,barrier against which all one's strength only served to dash one to
361,II,more hopeless ruin. He was not a dreamer; destiny passes by the
362,II,"dreamer, sparing him because he clamours for nothing. He was a child,"
363,II,"clamouring for so many things, all impossible. With a body too weak"
364,II,"for ordinary existence, he desired all the enchantments of all the"
365,II,"senses. With a soul too shy to tell its own secret, except in"
366,II,"exquisite evasions, he desired the boundless confidence of love. He"
367,II,"sang one tune, over and over, and no one listened to him. He had only"
368,II,"to form the most simple wish, and it was denied him. He gave way to"
369,II,"ill-luck, not knowing that he was giving way to his own weakness, and"
370,II,he tried to escape from the consciousness of things as they were at
371,II,"the best, by voluntarily choosing to accept them at their worst. For"
372,II,with him it was always voluntary. He was never quite without money; he
373,II,"had a little money of his own, and he had for many years a weekly"
374,II,"allowance from a publisher, in return for translations from the"
375,II,"French, or, if he chose to do it, original work. He was unhappy, and"
376,II,"he dared not think. To unhappy men, thought, if it can be set at work"
377,II,"on abstract questions, is the only substitute for happiness; if it has"
378,II,"not strength to overleap the barrier which shuts one in upon oneself,"
379,II,"it is the one unwearying torture. Dowson had exquisite sensibility, he"
380,II,vibrated in harmony with every delicate emotion; but he had no
381,II,"outlook, he had not the escape of intellect. His only escape, then,"
382,II,"was to plunge into the crowd, to fancy that he lost sight of himself"
383,II,as he disappeared from the sight of others. The more he soiled himself
384,II,"at that gross contact, the further would he seem to be from what"
385,II,"beckoned to him in one vain illusion after another vain illusion, in"
386,II,the delicate places of the world. Seeing himself moving to the sound
387,II,"of lutes, in some courtly disguise, down an alley of Watteau's"
388,II,"Versailles, while he touched finger-tips with a divine creature in"
389,II,"rose-leaf silks, what was there left for him, as the dream obstinately"
390,II,"refused to realise itself, but a blind flight into some Teniers"
391,II,"kitchen, where boors are making merry, without thought of yesterday or"
392,II,"to-morrow? There, perhaps, in that ferment of animal life, he could"
393,II,"forget life as he dreamed it, with too faint hold upon his dreams to"
394,II,make dreams come true.
395,II,
396,II,"For, there is not a dream which may not come true, if we have the"
397,II,"energy which makes, or chooses, our own fate. We can always, in this"
398,II,"world, get what we want, if we will it intensely and persistently"
399,II,enough. Whether we shall get it sooner or later is the concern of
400,II,fate; but we shall get it. It may come when we have no longer any use
401,II,"for it, when we have gone on willing it out of habit, or so as not to"
402,II,confess that we have failed. But it will come. So few people succeed
403,II,"greatly because so few people can conceive a great end, and work"
404,II,towards that end without deviating and without tiring. But we all know
405,II,that the man who works for money day and night gets rich; and the man
406,II,"who works day and night for no matter what kind of material power,"
407,II,"gets the power. It is the same with the deeper, more spiritual, as it"
408,II,"seems vaguer issues, which make for happiness and every intangible"
409,II,success. It is only the dreams of those light sleepers who dream
410,II,faintly that do not come true.
411,II,
412,II,"We get out of life, all of us, what we bring to it; that, and that"
413,II,"only, is what it can teach us. There are men whom Dowson's experiences"
414,II,"would have made great men, or great writers; for him they did very"
415,II,"little. Love and regret, with here and there the suggestion of an"
416,II,"uncomforting pleasure snatched by the way, are all that he has to sing"
417,II,"of; and he could have sung of them at much less ""expense of spirit,"""
418,II,"and, one fancies, without the ""waste of shame"" at all. Think what"
419,II,"Villon got directly out of his own life, what Verlaine, what Musset,"
420,II,"what Byron, got directly out of their own lives! It requires a strong"
421,II,"man to ""sin strongly"" and profit by it. To Dowson the tragedy of his"
422,II,"own life could only have resulted in an elegy. ""I have flung roses,"
423,II,"roses, riotously with the throng,"" he confesses in his most beautiful"
424,II,"poem; but it was as one who flings roses in a dream, as he passes with"
425,II,shut eyes through an unsubstantial throng. The depths into which he
426,II,"plunged were always waters of oblivion, and he returned forgetting"
427,II,"them. He is always a very ghostly lover, wandering in a land of"
428,II,"perpetual twilight, as he holds a whispered _colloque sentimental_"
429,II,with the ghost of an old love:
430,II,
431,II,"""Dans le vieux parc solitaire et glacé, Deux spectres ont évoqué le"
432,II,"passé."""
433,II,
434,II,"It was, indeed, almost a literal unconsciousness, as of one who leads"
435,II,"two lives, severed from one another as completely as sleep is from"
436,II,waking. Thus we get in his work very little of the personal appeal of
437,II,"those to whom riotous living, misery, a cross destiny, have been of so"
438,II,"real a value. And it is important to draw this distinction, if only"
439,II,for the benefit of those young men who are convinced that the first
440,II,step towards genius is disorder. Dowson is precisely one of the people
441,II,who are pointed out as confirming this theory. And yet Dowson was
442,II,"precisely one of those who owed least to circumstances; and, in"
443,II,"succumbing to them, he did no more than succumb to the destructive"
444,II,"forces which, shut up within him, pulled down the house of life upon"
445,II,his own head.
446,II,
447,II,"A soul ""unspotted from the world,"" in a body which one sees visibly"
448,II,soiling under one's eyes; that improbability is what all who knew him
449,II,"saw in Dowson, as his youthful physical grace gave way year by year,"
450,II,and the personal charm underlying it remained unchanged. There never
451,II,"was a simpler or more attaching charm, because there never was a"
452,II,sweeter or more honest nature. It was not because he ever said
453,II,"anything particularly clever or particularly interesting, it was not"
454,II,"because he gave you ideas, or impressed you by any strength or"
455,II,"originality, that you liked to be with him; but because of a certain"
456,II,"engaging quality, which seemed unconscious of itself, which was never"
457,II,"anxious to be or to do anything, which simply existed, as perfume"
458,II,"exists in a flower. Drink was like a heavy curtain, blotting out"
459,II,"everything of a sudden; when the curtain lifted, nothing had changed."
460,II,"Living always that double life, he had his true and his false aspect,"
461,II,"and the true life was the expression of that fresh, delicate, and"
462,II,"uncontaminated nature which some of us knew in him, and which remains"
463,II,"for us, untouched by the other, in every line that he wrote."
464,II,
465,II,
466,III,III
467,III,
468,III,Dowson was the only poet I ever knew who cared more for his prose than
469,III,"his verse; but he was wrong, and it is not by his prose that he will"
470,III,"live, exquisite as that prose was at its best. He wrote two novels in"
471,III,"collaboration with Mr. Arthur Moore: ""A Comedy of Masks,"" in 1893, and"
472,III,"""Adrian Rome,"" in 1899, both done under the influence of Mr. Henry"
473,III,"James, both interesting because they were personal studies, and"
474,III,"studies of known surroundings, rather than for their actual value as"
475,III,"novels. A volume of ""Stories and Studies in Sentiment,"" called"
476,III,"""Dilemmas,"" in which the influence of Mr. Wedmore was felt in addition"
477,III,"to the influence of Mr. James, appeared in 1895. Several other short"
478,III,"stories, among his best work in prose, have not yet been reprinted"
479,III,"from the _Savoy_. Some translations from the French, done as"
480,III,"hack-work, need not be mentioned here, though they were never without"
481,III,some traces of his peculiar quality of charm in language. The short
482,III,"stories were indeed rather ""studies in sentiment"" than stories;"
483,III,"studies of singular delicacy, but with only a faint hold on life, so"
484,III,that perhaps the best of them was not unnaturally a study in the
485,III,"approaches of death: ""The Dying of Francis Donne."" For the most part"
486,III,"they dealt with the same motives as the poems, hopeless and reverent"
487,III,"love, the ethics of renunciation, the disappointment of those who are"
488,III,too weak or too unlucky to take what they desire. They have a sad and
489,III,"quiet beauty of their own, the beauty of second thoughts and subdued"
490,III,"emotions, of choice and scholarly English, moving in the more fluid"
491,III,and reticent harmonies of prose almost as daintily as if it were
492,III,moving to the measure of verse. Dowson's care over English prose was
493,III,like that of a Frenchman writing his own language with the respect
494,III,which Frenchmen pay to French. Even English things had to come to him
495,III,"through France, if he was to prize them very highly; and there is a"
496,III,"passage in ""Dilemmas"" which I have always thought very characteristic"
497,III,"of his own tastes, as it refers to an ""infinitesimal library, a few"
498,III,"French novels, an Horace, and some well-thumbed volumes of the modern"
499,III,"English poets in the familiar edition of Tauchnitz."" He was Latin by"
500,III,"all his affinities, and that very quality of slightness, of parsimony"
501,III,"almost in his dealings with life and the substance of art, connects"
502,III,"him with the artists of Latin races, who have always been so"
503,III,"fastidious in their rejection of mere nature, when it comes too"
504,III,"nakedly or too clamorously into sight and hearing, and so gratefully"
505,III,content with a few choice things faultlessly done.
506,III,
507,III,"And Dowson, in his verse (the ""Verses"" of 1896, ""The Pierrot of the"
508,III,"Minute,"" a dramatic phantasy in one act, of 1897, the posthumous"
509,III,"volume ""Decorations""), was the same scrupulous artist as in his prose,"
510,III,and more felicitously at home there. He was quite Latin in his feeling
511,III,"for youth, and death, and ""the old age of roses,"" and the pathos of"
512,III,"our little hour in which to live and love; Latin in his elegance,"
513,III,"reticence, and simple grace in the treatment of these motives; Latin,"
514,III,"finally, in his sense of their sufficiency for the whole of one's"
515,III,"mental attitude. He used the commonplaces of poetry frankly, making"
516,III,them his own by his belief in them: the Horatian Cynara or Neobule was
517,III,still the natural symbol for him when he wished to be most personal. I
518,III,remember his saying to me that his ideal of a line of verse was the
519,III,line of Poe:
520,III,
521,III,"""The viol, the violet, and the vine"";"
522,III,
523,III,"and the gracious, not remote or unreal beauty, which clings about such"
524,III,"words and such images as these, was always to him the true poetical"
525,III,"beauty. There never was a poet to whom verse came more naturally, for"
526,III,"the song's sake; his theories were all æsthetic, almost technical"
527,III,"ones, such as a theory, indicated by his preference for the line of"
528,III,"Poe, that the letter ""v"" was the most beautiful of the letters, and"
529,III,could never be brought into verse too often. For any more abstract
530,III,theories he had neither tolerance nor need. Poetry as a philosophy did
531,III,not exist for him; it existed solely as the loveliest of the arts. He
532,III,"loved the elegance of Horace, all that was most complex in the"
533,III,"simplicity of Poe, most birdlike in the human melodies of Verlaine. He"
534,III,"had the pure lyric gift, unweighted or unballasted by any other"
535,III,"quality of mind or emotion; and a song, for him, was music first, and"
536,III,"then whatever you please afterwards, so long as it suggested, never"
537,III,"told, some delicate sentiment, a sigh or a caress; finding words, at"
538,III,"times, as perfect as the words of a poem headed, ""O Mors! quam amara"
539,III,"est memoria tua homini pacem habenti in substantiis suis."""
540,III,
541,III,"There, surely, the music of silence speaks, if it has ever spoken. The"
542,III,words seem to tremble back into the silence which their whisper has
543,III,"interrupted, but not before they have created for us a mood, such a"
544,III,mood as the Venetian Pastoral of Giorgione renders in painting.
545,III,"Languid, half inarticulate, coming from the heart of a drowsy sorrow"
546,III,"very conscious of itself, and not less sorrowful because it sees its"
547,III,"own face looking mournfully back out of the water, the song seems to"
548,III,"have been made by some fastidious amateur of grief, and it has all the"
549,III,"sighs and tremors of the mood, wrought into a faultless strain of"
550,III,"music. Stepping out of a paradise in which pain becomes so lovely, he"
551,III,"can see the beauty which is the other side of madness, and, in a"
552,III,"sonnet, ""To One in Bedlam,"" can create a more positive, a more"
553,III,"poignant mood, with fine subtlety."
554,III,
555,III,"Here, in the moment's intensity of this comradeship with madness,"
556,III,observe how beautiful the whole thing becomes; how instinctively the
557,III,"imagination of the poet turns what is sordid into a radiance, all"
558,III,stars and flowers and the divine part of forgetfulness! It is a symbol
559,III,"of the two sides of his own life: the side open to the street, and the"
560,III,"side turned away from it, where he could ""hush and bless himself with"
561,III,"silence."" No one ever worshipped beauty more devoutly, and just as we"
562,III,"see him here transfiguring a dreadful thing with beauty, so we shall"
563,III,"see, everywhere in his work, that he never admitted an emotion which"
564,III,he could not so transfigure. He knew his limits only too well; he knew
565,III,that the deeper and graver things of life were for the most part
566,III,"outside the circle of his magic; he passed them by, leaving much of"
567,III,"himself unexpressed, because he would not permit himself to express"
568,III,"nothing imperfectly, or according to anything but his own conception"
569,III,of the dignity of poetry. In the lyric in which he has epitomised
570,III,"himself and his whole life, a lyric which is certainly one of the"
571,III,"greatest lyrical poems of our time, ""Non sum qualis eram bonae sub"
572,III,"regno Cynarae,"" he has for once said everything, and he has said it to"
573,III,an intoxicating and perhaps immortal music.
574,III,
575,III,"Here, perpetuated by some unique energy of a temperament rarely so"
576,III,"much the master of itself, is the song of passion and the passions, at"
577,III,"their eternal war in the soul which they quicken or deaden, and in the"
578,III,"body which they break down between them. In the second book, the book"
579,III,"of ""Decorations,"" there are a few pieces which repeat, only more"
580,III,"faintly, this very personal note. Dowson could never have developed;"
581,III,"he had already said, in his first book of verse, all that he had to"
582,III,"say. Had he lived, had he gone on writing, he could only have echoed"
583,III,himself; and probably it would have been the less essential part of
584,III,"himself; his obligation to Swinburne, always evident, increasing as"
585,III,"his own inspiration failed him. He was always without ambition,"
586,III,"writing to please his own fastidious taste, with a kind of proud"
587,III,"humility in his attitude towards the public, not expecting or"
588,III,"requiring recognition. He died obscure, having ceased to care even for"
589,III,"the delightful labour of writing. He died young, worn out by what was"
590,III,"never really life to him, leaving a little verse which has the pathos"
591,III,of things too young and too frail ever to grow old.

1934,PIERROT,[_He gathers together his flowers and lays them at the foot of Cupid's
1935,PIERROT,statue; then he goes timidly up the first steps of the temple and
1936,PIERROT,stops._]
1937,PIERROT,
1938,PIERROT,PIERROT
1939,PIERROT,"It is so solitary, I grow afraid."
1940,PIERROT,"Is there no priest here, no devoted maid?"
1941,PIERROT,"Is there no oracle, no voice to speak,"
1942,PIERROT,Interpreting to me the word I seek?
1943,PIERROT,
1944,PIERROT,[_A very gentle music of lutes floats out from the temple. Pierrot
1945,PIERROT,starts back; he shows extreme surprise; then he returns to the
1946,PIERROT,"foreground, and crouches down in rapt attention until the music"
1947,PIERROT,ceases. His face grows puzzled and petulant._]
1948,PIERROT,
1949,PIERROT,PIERROT
1950,PIERROT,"Too soon! too soon! in that enchanting strain,"
1951,PIERROT,"Days yet unlived, I almost lived again:"
1952,PIERROT,It almost taught me that I most would know--
1953,PIERROT,"Why am I here, and why am I Pierrot?"
1954,PIERROT,
1955,PIERROT,"[_Absently he picks up a lily which has fallen to the ground, and"
1956,PIERROT,repeats:_]
1957,PIERROT,
1958,PIERROT,PIERROT
1959,PIERROT,"Why came I here, and why am I Pierrot?"
1960,PIERROT,That music and this silence both affright;
1961,PIERROT,Pierrot can never be a friend of night.
1962,PIERROT,I never felt my solitude before--
1963,PIERROT,"Once safe at home, I will return no more."
1964,PIERROT,Yet the commandment of the scroll was plain;
1965,PIERROT,While the light lingers let me read again.
1966,PIERROT,
1967,PIERROT,[_He takes a scroll from his bosom and reads:_]
1968,PIERROT,
1969,PIERROT,PIERROT
1970,PIERROT,"""_He loves to-night who never loved before;"
1971,PIERROT,"Who ever loved, to-night shall love once more._"""
1972,PIERROT,_I_ never loved! I know not what love is.
1973,PIERROT,I am so ignorant--but what is this?
1974,PIERROT,[_Reads:_]
1975,PIERROT,"""_Who would adventure to encounter Love"
1976,PIERROT,Must rest one night within this hallowed grove.
1977,PIERROT,"Cast down thy lilies, which have led thee on,"
1978,PIERROT,"Before the tender feet of Cupidon._"""
1979,PIERROT,"Thus much is done, the night remains to me."
1980,PIERROT,"Well, Cupidon, be my security!"
1981,PIERROT,"Here is more writing, but too faint to read."
1982,PIERROT,
1983,PIERROT,"[_He puzzles for a moment, then casts the scroll down._]"
1984,PIERROT,
1985,PIERROT,PIERROT
1986,PIERROT,"Hence, vain old parchment. I have learnt thy rede!"
1987,PIERROT,
1988,PIERROT,"[_He looks round uneasily, starts at his shadow; then discovers his"
1989,PIERROT,"basket with glee. He takes out a flask of wine, pours it into a glass,"
1990,PIERROT,and drinks._]
1991,PIERROT,
1992,PIERROT,PIERROT
1993,PIERROT,"_Courage, mon Ami!_ I shall never miss"
1994,PIERROT,Society with such a friend as this.
1995,PIERROT,"How merrily the rosy bubbles pass,"
1996,PIERROT,Across the amber crystal of the glass.
1997,PIERROT,I had forgotten you. Methinks this quest
1998,PIERROT,Can wake no sweeter echo in my breast.
1999,PIERROT,
2000,PIERROT,"[_Looks round at the statue, and starts._]"
2001,PIERROT,
2002,PIERROT,PIERROT

2007,PIERROT,PIERROT
2008,PIERROT,"This libation, Cupid, take,"
2009,PIERROT,With the lilies at thy feet;

2011,PIERROT,"Send him visions strange and sweet,"
2012,PIERROT,While he slumbers at thy feet.
2013,PIERROT,Only love kiss him awake!
2014,PIERROT,_Only love kiss him awake_!
2015,PIERROT,
2016,PIERROT,"[_Slowly falls the darkness, soft music plays, while Pierrot gathers"
2017,PIERROT,together fern and foliage into a rough couch at the foot of the steps
2018,PIERROT,"which lead to the Temple d'Amour. Then he lies down upon it, having"
2019,PIERROT,made his prayer. It is night._]
2020,PIERROT,
2021,PIERROT,PIERROT [_Softly._]
2022,PIERROT,"Music, more music, far away and faint:"
2023,PIERROT,It is an echo of mine heart's complaint.
2024,PIERROT,Why should I be so musical and sad?
2025,PIERROT,I wonder why I used to be so glad?
2026,PIERROT,"In single glee I chased blue butterflies,"
2027,PIERROT,"Half butterfly myself, but not so wise,"
2028,PIERROT,"For they were twain, and I was only one."
2029,PIERROT,Ah me! how pitiful to be alone.
2030,PIERROT,"My brown birds told me much, but in mine ear"
2031,PIERROT,They never whispered this--I learned it here:
2032,PIERROT,"The soft wood sounds, the rustlings in the breeze,"
2033,PIERROT,Are but the stealthy kisses of the trees.
2034,PIERROT,Each flower and fern in this enchanted wood
2035,PIERROT,"Leans to her fellow, and is understood;"
2036,PIERROT,"The eglantine, in loftier station set,"
2037,PIERROT,Stoops down to woo the maidly violet.
2038,PIERROT,In gracile pairs the very lilies grow:
2039,PIERROT,None is companionless except Pierrot.
2040,PIERROT,"Music, more music! how its echoes steal"
2041,PIERROT,Upon my senses with unlooked for weal.
2042,PIERROT,"Tired am I, tired, and far from this lone glade"
2043,PIERROT,Seems mine old joy in rout and masquerade.
2044,PIERROT,"Sleep cometh over me, now will I prove,"
2045,PIERROT,"By Cupid's grace, what is this thing called love."
2046,PIERROT,
2047,PIERROT,[_Sleeps._]
2048,PIERROT,
2049,PIERROT,"[_There is more music of lutes for an interval, during which a bright"
2050,PIERROT,"radiance, white and cold, streams from the temple upon the face of"
2051,PIERROT,Pierrot. Presently a Moon Maiden steps out of the temple; she descends
2052,PIERROT,and stands over the sleeper._]
2053,PIERROT,
2054,THE LADY,THE LADY
2055,THE LADY,Who is this mortal
2056,THE LADY,Who ventures to-night
2057,THE LADY,To woo an immortal?
2058,THE LADY,"Cold, cold the moon's light"

2077,THE LADY,What Pierrot ever has escaped his fate?
2078,THE LADY,"What if I warned him! He might yet evade,"
2079,THE LADY,Through the long windings of this verdant glade;
2080,THE LADY,"Seek his companions in the blither way,"
2081,THE LADY,"Which, else, must be as lost as yesterday."
2082,THE LADY,So might he still pass some unheeding hours
2083,THE LADY,In the sweet company of birds and flowers.
2084,THE LADY,"How fair he is, with red lips formed for joy,"
2085,THE LADY,As softly curved as those of Venus' boy.
2086,THE LADY,"Methinks his eyes, beneath their silver sheaves,"
2087,THE LADY,Rest tranquilly like lilies under leaves.
2088,THE LADY,"Arrayed in innocence, what touch of grace"
2089,THE LADY,Reveals the scion of a courtly race?
2090,THE LADY,"Well, I will warn him, though, I fear, too late--"
2091,THE LADY,What Pierrot ever has escaped his fate?
2092,THE LADY,"But, see, he stirs, new knowledge fires his brain,"
2093,THE LADY,And Cupid's vision bids him wake again.
2094,THE LADY,"Dione's Daughter! but how fair he is,"
2095,THE LADY,Would it be wrong to rouse him with a kiss?

2276,PIERROT,"Cold is thy kiss, more cold than I could dream"
2277,PIERROT,"Arctus sits, watching the Boreal stream:"
2278,PIERROT,But with its frost such sweetness did conspire
2279,PIERROT,That all my veins are filled with running fire;

2333,THE LADY,This attitude becomes not scholarship!

3680,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"best keep out of cathedrals; they are vault-like places, pregnant with"
3681,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,rheumatism--at best they are full of ghosts. And a good many
3682,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,_revenants_ visited me during that hour of meditation. Afterwards I
3683,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,paid a visit to the Memlings in the Hôpital. Nothing has altered very
3684,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"much; even the women, with their placid, ugly Flemish faces, sitting"
3685,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"eternally in their doorways with the eternal lace-pillow, might be the"
3686,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"same women. In the afternoon I went to the Béguinage, and sat there"
3687,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"long in the shadow of a tree, which must have grown up since my time,"
3688,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"I think. I sat there too long, I fear, until the dusk and the chill"
3689,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,drove me home to dinner. On the whole perhaps it was a mistake to come
3690,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,back. The sameness of this terribly constant old city seems to
3691,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,intensify the change that has come to oneself. Perhaps if I had come
3692,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"back with Lorimer I should have noticed it less. For, after all, the"
3693,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"years have been kind to me, on the whole; they have given me most"
3694,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"things which I set my heart upon, and if they had not broken a most"
3695,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"perfect friendship, I would forgive them the rest. I sometimes feel,"
3696,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"however, that one sacrifices too much to one's success. To slave"
3697,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"twenty years at the Indian bar has its drawbacks, even when it does"
3698,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"leave one at fifty, prosperous _à mourir d'ennui_. Yes, I must admit"
3699,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"that I am prosperous, disgustingly prosperous, and--my wife is dead,"
3700,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"and Lorimer--Lorimer has altogether passed out of my life. Ah, it is a"
3701,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,mistake to keep a journal--a mistake.

3704,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,_3rd October._
3705,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3706,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,I vowed yesterday that I would pack my portmanteau and move on to
3707,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"Brussels, but to-day finds me still at Bruges. The charm of the old"
3708,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,Flemish city grows on me. To-day I carried my peregrinations further
3709,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,a-field. I wandered about the Quais and stood on the old bridge where
3710,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"one obtains such a perfect glimpse, through a trellis of chestnuts, of"
3711,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,the red roof and spires of Notre Dame. But the particular locality
3712,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,matters nothing; every nook and corner of Bruges teems with
3713,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,reminiscences. And how fresh they are! At Bombay I had not time to
3714,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,remember or to regret; but to-day the whole dead and forgotten story
3715,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"rises up like a ghost to haunt me. At times, moreover, I have a"
3716,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"curious, fantastic feeling, that some day or other, in some mildewing"
3717,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"church, I shall come face to face with Lorimer. He was older than I,"
3718,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"he must be greatly altered, but I should know him. It is strange how"
3719,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,intensely I desire to meet him. I suppose it is chiefly curiosity. I
3720,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"should like to feel sure of him, to explain his silence. He cannot be"
3721,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"dead. I am told that he had pictures in this last Academy--and yet,"
3722,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"never to have written--never once, through all these years. I suppose"
3723,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,there are few friendships which can stand the test of correspondence.
3724,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"Still it is inexplicable, it is not like Lorimer. He could not have"
3725,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,harboured a grudge against me--for what? A boyish infatuation for a
3726,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"woman who adored him, and whom he adored. The idea is preposterous,"
3727,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"they must have laughed over my folly often, of winter evenings by"
3728,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"their fireside. For they married, they must have married, they were"
3729,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,made for each other and they knew it. Was their marriage happy I
3730,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"wonder? Was it as successful as mine, though perhaps a little less"
3731,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"commonplace? It is strange, though, that I never heard of it, that he"
3732,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"never wrote to me once, not through all those years."
3733,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3734,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3735,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,_4th October._
3736,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3737,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,Inexplicable! Inexplicable! _Did_ they marry after all? Could there
3738,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,have been some gigantic misunderstanding? I paid a pilgrimage this
3739,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"morning which hitherto I had deferred, I know not precisely why. I"
3740,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"went to the old house in the Rue d'Alva--where she lived, our"
3741,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"Comtesse. And the sight of its grim, historic frontal made twenty"
3742,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,years seem as yesterday. I meant to content myself with a mere glimpse
3743,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"at the barred windows, but the impulse seized me to ring the bell"
3744,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"which I used to ring so often. It was a foolish, fantastic impulse,"
3745,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"but I obeyed it. I found it was occupied by an Englishman, a Mr."
3746,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,Venables--there seem to be more English here than in my time--and I
3747,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,sent in my card and asked if I might see the famous dining-room. There
3748,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"was no objection raised, my host was most courteous, my name, he said,"
3749,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,was familiar to him; he is evidently proud of his dilapidated old
3750,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"palace, and has had the grace to save it from the attentions of the"
3751,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,upholsterer. No! twenty years have produced very little change in the
3752,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,room where we had so many pleasant sittings. The ancient stamped
3753,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"leather on the walls is perhaps a trifle more ragged, the old oak"
3754,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,panels not blacker--that were impossible--but a trifle more
3755,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,worm-eaten; it is the same room. I must have seemed a sad boor to my
3756,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"polite cicerone as I stood, hat in hand, and silently took in all the"
3757,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"old familiar details. The same smell of mildewed antiquity, I could"
3758,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,almost believe the same furniture. And indeed my host tells me that he
3759,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"took over the house as it was, and that some of the chairs and tables"
3760,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"are scarcely more youthful than the walls. Yes, there by the huge"
3761,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"fireplace was the same quaintly carved chair where she always sat. Ah,"
3762,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,those delicious evenings when one was five-and-twenty. For the moment
3763,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,I should not have been surprised if she had suddenly taken shape
3764,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"before my eyes, in the old seat, the slim, girlish woman in her white"
3765,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"dress, her hands folded in her lap, her quiet eyes gazing dreamily"
3766,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"into the red fire, a subtile air of distinction in her whole"
3767,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"posture.... She would be old now, I suppose. Would she? Ah no, she was"
3768,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,not one of the women who grow old.... I caught up the thread of my
3769,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,host's discourse just as he was pointing it with a sharp rap upon one
3770,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,of the most time-stained panels.
3771,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3772,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'Behind there,' he remarked, with pardonable pride, 'is the secret"
3773,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,passage where the Duc d'Alva was assassinated.'
3774,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3775,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,I smiled apologetically.
3776,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3777,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'Yes,' I said, 'I know it. I should explain perhaps--my excuse for"
3778,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,troubling you was not merely historic curiosity. I have more personal
3779,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,associations with this room. I spent some charming hours in it a great
3780,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,many years ago--' and for the moment I had forgotten that I was
3781,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,nearly fifty.
3782,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3783,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'Ah,' he said, with interest, 'you know the late people, the"
3784,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,Fontaines.'
3785,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3786,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'No,' I said, 'I am afraid I have never heard of them. I am very"
3787,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,ancient. In my time it belonged to the Savaresse family.'
3788,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3789,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'So I have heard,' he said, 'but that was long ago. I have only had it"
3790,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,a few years. Fontaine my landlord bought it from them. Did you know M.
3791,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,le Comte!'
3792,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3793,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'No,' I answered, 'Madame la Comtesse. She was left a widow very"
3794,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,shortly after her marriage. I never knew M. le Comte.'
3795,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3796,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,My host shrugged his shoulders.
3797,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3798,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'From all accounts,' he said, 'you did not lose very much.'"
3799,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3800,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'It was an unhappy marriage,' I remarked, vaguely, 'most unhappy. Her"
3801,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,second marriage promised greater felicity.'
3802,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3803,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,Mr. Venables looked at me curiously.
3804,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3805,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'I understood,' he began, but he broke off abruptly. 'I did not know"
3806,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,Madame de Savaresse married again.'
3807,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3808,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"His tone had suddenly changed, it had grown less cordial, and we"
3809,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,parted shortly afterwards with a certain constraint. And as I walked
3810,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"home pensively curious, his interrupted sentence puzzled me. Does he"
3811,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"look upon me as an impostor, a vulgar gossip-monger? What has he"
3812,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"heard, what does he know of her? Does he know anything? I cannot help"
3813,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"believing so. I almost wish I had asked him definitely, but he would"
3814,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"have misunderstood my motives. Yet, even so, I wish I had asked him."
3815,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3816,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3817,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,_6th October._
3818,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3819,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"I am still living constantly in the past, and the fantastic feeling,"
3820,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,whenever I enter a church or turn a corner that I shall meet Lorimer
3821,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"again, has grown into a settled conviction. Yes, I shall meet him, and"
3822,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,in Bruges.... It is strange how an episode which one has thrust away
3823,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,out of sight and forgotten for years will be started back into renewed
3824,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,life by the merest trifle. And for the last week it has all been as
3825,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,vivid as if it happened yesterday. To-night I have been putting
3826,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,questions to myself--so far with no very satisfactory answer. _Was_ it
3827,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,a boyish infatuation after all? Has it passed away as utterly as I
3828,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,believed? I can see her face now as I sit by the fire with the finest
3829,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"precision of detail. I can hear her voice, that soft, low voice, which"
3830,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,was none the less sweet for its modulation of sadness. I think there
3831,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"are no women like her now-a-days--none, none! _Did_ she marry Lorimer?"
3832,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,and if not--? It seems strange now that we should have both been so
3833,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"attracted, and yet not strange when one considers it. At least we were"
3834,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,never jealous of one another. How the details rush back upon one! I
3835,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,think we must have fallen in love with her at the same moment--for we
3836,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"were together when we saw her for the first time, we were together"
3837,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,when we went first to call on her in the Rue d'Alva--I doubt if we
3838,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,ever saw her except together. It was soon after we began to get
3839,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,intimate that she wore white again. She told us that we had given her
3840,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,back her youth. She joined our sketching expeditions with the most
3841,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,supreme contempt for _les convenances_; when she was not fluttering
3842,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"round, passing from Lorimer's canvas to mine with her sweetly"
3843,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"inconsequent criticism, she sat in the long grass and read to"
3844,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,us--André Chénier and Lamartine. In the evening we went to see her;
3845,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"she denied herself to the rest of the world, and we sat for hours in"
3846,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"that ancient room in the delicious twilight, while she sang to us--she"
3847,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"sang divinely--little French _chansons_, gay and sad, and snatches of"
3848,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,_operette_. How we adored her! I think she knew from the first how it
3849,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,would be and postponed it as long as she could. But at last she saw
3850,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,that it was inevitable.... I remember the last evening that we were
3851,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,there--remember--shall I ever forget it? We had stayed beyond our
3852,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,usual hour and when we rose to go we all of us knew that those
3853,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,pleasant irresponsible evenings had come to an end. And both Lorimer
3854,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"and I stood for a moment on the threshold before we said good-night,"
3855,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,feeling I suppose that one of us was there for the last time.
3856,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3857,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"And how graceful, how gracious she was as she held out one little"
3858,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"white hand to Lorimer and one to me. 'Good-night, dear friends,' she"
3859,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"said, 'I like you both so much--so much. Believe me, I am grateful to"
3860,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"you both--for having given me back my faith in life, in friendship,"
3861,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"believe that, will you not, _mes amis_?' Then for just one delirious"
3862,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"moment her eyes met mine and it seemed to me--ah, well, after all it"
3863,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,was Lorimer she loved.
3864,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3865,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,

3867,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3868,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"It seems a Quixotic piece of folly now, our proposal we would neither"
3869,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"take advantage of the other, but we both of us _must_ speak. We wrote"
3870,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"to her at the same time and likely enough, in the same words, we"
3871,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,posted our letters by the same post. To-day I had the curiosity to
3872,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"take out her answer to me from my desk, and I read it quite calmly and"
3873,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"dispassionately, the poor yellow letter with the faded ink, which"
3874,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,wrote 'Finis' to my youth and made a man of me.
3875,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3876,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'_Pauvre cher Ami_,' she wrote to me, and when I had read that, for"
3877,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,the first time in my life and the only time Lorimer's superiority was
3878,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,bitter to me. The rest I deciphered through scalding tears.
3879,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,
3880,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"'_Pauvre cher Ami_, I am very sorry for you, and yet I think you"
3881,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"should have guessed and have spared yourself this pain, and me too a"
3882,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"little. No, my friend, that which you ask of me is impossible. You are"
3883,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"my dear friend, but it is your brother whom I love--your brother, for"
3884,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"are you not as brothers, and I cannot break your beautiful friendship."
3885,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"No, that must not be. See, I ask one favour of you--I have written"
3886,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"also to him, only one little word ""Viens,""--but will you not go to him"
3887,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"and tell him for me? Ah, my brother, my heart bleeds for you. I too"
3888,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"have suffered in my time. You will go away now, yes, that is best, but"
3889,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,you will return when this fancy of yours has passed. Ah forgive
3890,THE DIARY OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN,"me--that I am happy--forgive us, forgive me. Let us still be friends."

3920,DELPHINE.',"In the Church of the Dames Rouges, I met to-day my old friend"
3921,DELPHINE.',"Sebastian Lorimer. Strange! Strange! He was greatly altered, I wonder"
3922,DELPHINE.',almost that I recognised him. I had strolled into the church for
3923,DELPHINE.',"benediction, for the first time since I have been back here, and when"
3924,DELPHINE.',"the service was over and I swung back the heavy door, with the"
3925,DELPHINE.',"exquisite music of the 'O Salutaris,' sung by those buried women"
3926,DELPHINE.',"behind the screen still echoing in my ear, I paused a moment to let a"
3927,DELPHINE.',"man pass by me. It was Lorimer, he looked wild and worn; it was no"
3928,DELPHINE.',more than the ghost of my old friend. I was shocked and startled by
3929,DELPHINE.',his manner. We shook hands quite impassively as if we had parted
3930,DELPHINE.',"yesterday. He talked in a rambling way as we walked towards my hotel,"
3931,DELPHINE.',"of the singing of the nuns, of the numerous religious processions, of"
3932,DELPHINE.',the blessed doctrine of the intercession of saints. The old melodious
3933,DELPHINE.',"voice was unchanged, but it was pitched in the singularly low key"
3934,DELPHINE.',which I have noticed some foreign priests acquire who live much in
3935,DELPHINE.',churches. I gather that he has become a Catholic. I do not know what
3936,DELPHINE.',"intangible instinct, or it may be fear, prevented me from putting to"
3937,DELPHINE.',him the vital question which has so perplexed me. It is astonishing
3938,DELPHINE.',"how his face has changed, what an extraordinary restlessness his"
3939,DELPHINE.',speech and eye have acquired. It never was so of old. My first
3940,DELPHINE.',impression was that he was suffering from some acute form of nervous
3941,DELPHINE.',"disorder, but before I left him a more unpleasant suspicion was"
3942,DELPHINE.',gradually forced upon me. I cannot help thinking that there is more
3943,DELPHINE.',than a touch of insanity in my old friend. I tried from time to time
3944,DELPHINE.',"to bring him down to personal topics, but he eluded them dexterously,"
3945,DELPHINE.',and it was only for a moment or so that I could keep him away from the
3946,DELPHINE.',"all absorbing subject of the Catholic Church, which seems in some of"
3947,DELPHINE.',its more sombre aspects to exercise an extraordinary fascination over
3948,DELPHINE.',him. I asked him if he often visited Bruges.

3950,DELPHINE.',He looked up at me with a curious expression of surprise.

3958,DELPHINE.',"He uttered a quaint, short laugh."
3959,DELPHINE.',
3960,DELPHINE.',"'One can be near--very near, even if one can never be quite close.'"
3961,DELPHINE.',
3962,DELPHINE.',"He tells me that he still paints, and that the Academy, to which he"
3963,DELPHINE.',"sends a picture yearly, has recently elected him an Associate. But his"
3964,DELPHINE.',"art does not seem to absorb him as it did of old, and he speaks of his"
3965,DELPHINE.',success drily and as a matter of very secondary importance. He refused
3966,DELPHINE.',"to dine with me, alleging an engagement, but that so hesitatingly and"
3967,DELPHINE.',with such vagueness that I could perceive it was the merest pretext.
3968,DELPHINE.',His manner was so strange and remote that I did not venture to press
3969,DELPHINE.',him. I think he is unhappily conscious of his own frequent
3970,DELPHINE.',incoherencies and at moments there are quite painful pauses when he is
3971,DELPHINE.',"obviously struggling with dumb piteousness to be lucid, to collect"
3972,DELPHINE.',himself and pick up certain lost threads in his memory. He is coming
3973,DELPHINE.',"to see me this evening, at his own suggestion, and I am waiting for"
3974,DELPHINE.',him now with a strange terror oppressing me. I cannot help thinking
3975,DELPHINE.',"that he possesses the key to all that has so puzzled me, and that"
3976,DELPHINE.',to-night he will endeavour to speak.
3977,DELPHINE.',
3978,DELPHINE.',
3979,DELPHINE.',_11th October._
3980,DELPHINE.',
3981,DELPHINE.',Poor Lorimer! I have hardly yet got over the shock which his visit
3982,DELPHINE.',"last night caused me, and the amazement with which I heard and read"
3983,DELPHINE.',"between the lines of his strange confession. His once clear reason is,"
3984,DELPHINE.',"I fear, hopelessly obscured, and how much of his story is"
3985,DELPHINE.',"hallucination, I cannot say. His notions of time and place are quite"
3986,DELPHINE.',"confused, and out of his rambling statement I can only be sure of one"
3987,DELPHINE.',"fact. It seems that he has done me a great wrong, an irreparable"
3988,DELPHINE.',"wrong, which he has since bitterly repented."
3989,DELPHINE.',
3990,DELPHINE.',"And in the light of this poor wretch's story, a great misunderstanding"
3991,DELPHINE.',"is rolled away, and I am left with the conviction that the last twenty"
3992,DELPHINE.',"years have been after all a huge blunder, an irrevocable and miserable"
3993,DELPHINE.',mistake. Through my own rash precipitancy and Lorimer's weak
3994,DELPHINE.',"treachery, a trivial mischance that a single word would have"
3995,DELPHINE.',"rectified, has been prolonged beyond hope of redress. It seems that"
3996,DELPHINE.',after all it was not Lorimer whom she chose. Madame de Savaresse
3997,DELPHINE.',"writing to us both twenty years ago, made a vital and yet not"
3998,DELPHINE.',"inexplicable mistake. She confused her envelopes, and the letter which"
3999,DELPHINE.',"I received was never meant for me, although it was couched in such"
4000,DELPHINE.',ambiguous terms that until to-day the possibility of this error never
4001,DELPHINE.',"dawned on me. And my letter, the one little word of which she spoke,"
4002,DELPHINE.',"was sent to Lorimer. Poor wretch! he did me a vital injury--yes, I can"
4003,DELPHINE.',"say that now--a vital injury, but on the whole I pity him. To have"
4004,DELPHINE.',"been suddenly dashed down from the pinnacles of happiness, it must"
4005,DELPHINE.',have been a cruel blow. He tells me that when he saw her that
4006,DELPHINE.',"afternoon and found out his mistake, he had no thought except to"
4007,DELPHINE.',"recall me. He actually came to London for that purpose, vowed to her"
4008,DELPHINE.',"solemnly that he would bring me back; it was only in England, that, to"
4009,DELPHINE.',"use his own distraught phrase, the Devil entered into possession of"
4010,DELPHINE.',him. His half-insane ramblings gave me a very vivid idea of that
4011,DELPHINE.',"fortnight during which he lay hid in London, trembling like a guilty"
4012,DELPHINE.',"thing, fearful at every moment that he might run across me and yet"
4013,DELPHINE.',half longing for the meeting with the irresoluteness of the weak
4014,DELPHINE.',"nature, which can conceive and to a certain extent execute a"
4015,DELPHINE.',"_lâcheté_, yet which would always gladly yield to circumstance and let"
4016,DELPHINE.',chance or fate decide the issue. And to the very last Lorimer was
4017,DELPHINE.',"wavering--had almost sought me out, and thrown himself on my mercy,"
4018,DELPHINE.',when the news came that I had sailed.
4019,DELPHINE.',
4020,DELPHINE.',"Destiny who has no weak scruples, had stepped in and sealed Delphine's"
4021,DELPHINE.',"mistake for all time, after her grim fashion. When he went back to"
4022,DELPHINE.',"Bruges, and saw Madame de Savaresse, I think she must have partly"
4023,DELPHINE.',guessed his baseness. Lorimer was not strong enough to be a successful
4024,DELPHINE.',"hypocrite, and that meeting, I gather, was also their final parting."
4025,DELPHINE.',She must have said things to him in her beautiful quiet voice which he
4026,DELPHINE.',has never forgotten. He went away and each day he was going to write
4027,DELPHINE.',"to me, and each day he deferred it, and then he took up the _Times_"
4028,DELPHINE.',one morning and read the announcement of my marriage. After that it
4029,DELPHINE.',seemed to him that he could only be silent....
4030,DELPHINE.',
4031,DELPHINE.',Did _she_ know of it too? Did she suffer or did she understand? Poor
4032,DELPHINE.',"woman! poor woman! I wonder if she consoled herself, as I did, and if"
4033,DELPHINE.',"so how she looks back on her success? I wonder whether she is happy,"
4034,DELPHINE.',whether she is dead? I suppose these are questions which will remain
4035,DELPHINE.',"unanswered. And yet when Lorimer left me at a late hour last night, it"
4036,DELPHINE.',seemed to me that the air was full of unspoken words. Does he know
4037,DELPHINE.',anything of her now! I have a right to ask him these things. And
4038,DELPHINE.',"to-morrow I am to meet him, he made the request most strangely--at the"
4039,DELPHINE.',same place where we fell in with each other to-day--until to-morrow
4040,DELPHINE.',then!
4041,DELPHINE.',
4042,DELPHINE.',
4043,DELPHINE.',_12th October._
4044,DELPHINE.',
4045,DELPHINE.',I have just left Sebastian Lorimer at the Church of the Dames Rouges.
4046,DELPHINE.',"I hope I was not cruel, but there are some things which one can"
4047,DELPHINE.',"neither forget nor forgive, and it seemed to me that when I knew the"
4048,DELPHINE.',"full measure of the ruin he had wrought, my pity for him withered"
4049,DELPHINE.',"away. 'I hope, Lorimer,' I said, 'that we may never meet again.' And,"
4050,DELPHINE.',"honestly, I cannot forgive him. If she had been happy, if she had let"
4051,DELPHINE.',"time deal gently with her--ah yes, even if she were dead--it might be"
4052,DELPHINE.',"easier. But that this living entombment, this hopeless death in life"
4053,DELPHINE.',"should befall her, she so magnificently fitted for life's finer"
4054,DELPHINE.',"offices, ah, the pity of it, the pity of it!... But let me set down"
4055,DELPHINE.',the whole sad story as it dawned upon me this afternoon in that
4056,DELPHINE.',unearthly church. I was later than the hour appointed; vespers were
4057,DELPHINE.',"over and a server, taper in hand, was gradually transforming the gloom"
4058,DELPHINE.',of the high altar into a blaze of light. With a strange sense of
4059,DELPHINE.',"completion I took my place next to the chair by which Lorimer, with"
4060,DELPHINE.',"bowed head, was kneeling, his eyes fixed with a strange intentness on"
4061,DELPHINE.',the screen which separated the outer worshippers from the chapel or
4062,DELPHINE.',gallery which was set apart for the nuns. His lips moved from time to
4063,DELPHINE.',"time spasmodically, in prayer or ejaculation: then as the jubilant"
4064,DELPHINE.',"organ burst out, and the officiating priest in his dalmatic of cloth"
4065,DELPHINE.',"of gold passed from the sacristy and genuflected at the altar, he"
4066,DELPHINE.',seemed to be listening in a very passion of attention. But as the
4067,DELPHINE.',"incense began to fill the air, and the Litany of Loreto smote on my"
4068,DELPHINE.',"ear to some sorrowful, undulating Gregorian, I lost thought of the"
4069,DELPHINE.',wretched man beside me; I forgot the miserable mistake that he had
4070,DELPHINE.',"perpetuated, and I was once more back in the past--with"
4071,DELPHINE.',Delphine--kneeling by her side. Strophe by strophe that perfect litany
4072,DELPHINE.',"rose and was lost in a cloud of incense, in the mazy arches of the"
4073,DELPHINE.',roof.
4074,DELPHINE.',
4075,DELPHINE.',"'Janua cœli,"
4076,DELPHINE.',"Stella matutina,"
4077,DELPHINE.',"Salus infirmorum, Ora pro nobis!'"
4078,DELPHINE.',
4079,DELPHINE.',"In strophe and antistrophe: the melancholy, nasal intonation of the"
4080,DELPHINE.',"priest died away, and the exquisite women's voices in the gallery took"
4081,DELPHINE.',"it up with exultation, and yet with something like a sob--a sob of"
4082,DELPHINE.',limitation.
4083,DELPHINE.',
4084,DELPHINE.',"'Refugium peccatorum,"
4085,DELPHINE.',"Consolatrix afflictorum,"
4086,DELPHINE.',"Auxilium Christianorum, Ora pro nobis!'"
4087,DELPHINE.',
4088,DELPHINE.',"And so on through all the exquisite changes of the hymn, until the"
4089,DELPHINE.',"time of the music changed, and the priest intoned the closing line."
4090,DELPHINE.',
4091,DELPHINE.',"'Ora pro nobis, Sancta Dei Genetrix!'"
4092,DELPHINE.',
4093,DELPHINE.',and the voices in the gallery answered:
4094,DELPHINE.',
4095,DELPHINE.','Ut digni efficiamur promissionibus Christi.'
4096,DELPHINE.',
4097,DELPHINE.',"There was one voice which rose above all the others, a voice of"
4098,DELPHINE.',"marvellous sweetness and power, which from the first moment had caused"
4099,DELPHINE.',me a curious thrill. And presently Lorimer bent down and whispered to
4100,DELPHINE.',"me: 'So near,' he murmured, 'and yet so far away--so near, and yet"
4101,DELPHINE.',never quite close!'
4102,DELPHINE.',
4103,DELPHINE.',"But before he had spoken I had read in his rigid face, in his eyes"
4104,DELPHINE.',"fixed with such a passion of regret on the screen, why we were"
4105,DELPHINE.',there--whose voice it was we had listened to.
4106,DELPHINE.',
4107,DELPHINE.',I rose and went out of the church quietly and hastily; I felt that to
4108,DELPHINE.',stay there one moment longer would be suffocation.... Poor woman! so
4109,DELPHINE.',"this is how she sought consolation, in religion! Well, there are"
4110,DELPHINE.',different ways for different persons--and for me--what is there left
4111,DELPHINE.',"for me? Oh, many things, no doubt, many things. Still, for once and"
4112,DELPHINE.',"for the last time, let me set myself down as a dreary fraud. I never"
4113,DELPHINE.',"forgot her, not for one hour or day, not even when it seemed to me"
4114,DELPHINE.',"that I had forgotten her most, not even when I married. No woman ever"
4115,DELPHINE.',represented to me the same idea as Madame de Savaresse. No woman's
4116,DELPHINE.',"voice was ever sweet to me after hers, the touch of no woman's hand"
4117,DELPHINE.',"ever made my heart beat one moment quicker for pleasure or for pain,"
4118,DELPHINE.',since I pressed hers for the last time on that fateful evening twenty
4119,DELPHINE.',years ago. Even so--!...
4120,DELPHINE.',
4121,DELPHINE.',When the service was over and the people had streamed out and
4122,DELPHINE.',"dispersed, I went back for the last time into the quiet church. A"
4123,DELPHINE.',white robed server was extinguishing the last candle on the altar;
4124,DELPHINE.',"only the one red light perpetually vigilant before the sanctuary, made"
4125,DELPHINE.',more visible the deep shadows everywhere.
4126,DELPHINE.',
4127,DELPHINE.',Lorimer was still kneeling with bowed head in his place. Presently he
4128,DELPHINE.',"rose and came towards me. 'She was there--Delphine--you heard her. Ah,"
4129,DELPHINE.',"Dion, she loves you, she always loves you, you are avenged.'"
4130,DELPHINE.',
4131,DELPHINE.',"I gather that for years he has spent hours daily in this church, to be"
4132,DELPHINE.',"near her, and hear her voice, the magnificent voice rising above all"
4133,DELPHINE.',the other voices in the chants of her religion. But he will never see
4134,DELPHINE.',"her, for is she not of the Dames Rouges! And I remember now all the"
4135,DELPHINE.',"stories of the Order, of its strictness, its austerity, its perfect"
4136,DELPHINE.',"isolation. And chiefly, I remember how they say that only twice after"
4137,DELPHINE.',one of these nuns has taken her vows is she seen of any one except
4138,DELPHINE.',"those of her community; once, when she enters the Order, the door of"
4139,DELPHINE.',the convent is thrown back and she is seen for a single moment in the
4140,DELPHINE.',"scarlet habit of the Order, by the world, by all who care to gaze; and"
4141,DELPHINE.',"once more, at the last, when clad in the same coarse red garb, they"
4142,DELPHINE.',"bear her out quietly, in her coffin, into the church."
4143,DELPHINE.',
4144,DELPHINE.',"And of this last meeting, Lorimer, I gather, is always restlessly"
4145,DELPHINE.',"expectant, his whole life concentrated, as it were, in a very passion"
4146,DELPHINE.',"of waiting for a moment which will surely come. His theory, I confess,"
4147,DELPHINE.',"escapes me, nor can I guess how far a certain feverish remorse, an"
4148,DELPHINE.',intention of expiation may be set as a guiding spring in his unhinged
4149,DELPHINE.',"mind, and account, at least in part, for the fantastic attitude which"
4150,DELPHINE.',"he must have adopted for many years. If I cannot forgive him, at least"
4151,DELPHINE.',"I bear him no malice, and for the rest, our paths will hardly cross"
4152,DELPHINE.',"again. One takes up one's life and expiates its errors, each after"
4153,DELPHINE.',one's several fashion--and my way is not Lorimer's. And now that it is
4154,DELPHINE.',"all so clear, there is nothing to keep me here any longer, nothing to"
4155,DELPHINE.',"bring me back again. For it seemed to me to-day, strangely enough, as"
4156,DELPHINE.',"though a certain candle of hope, of promise, of pleasant"
4157,DELPHINE.',"possibilities, which had flickered with more or less light for so many"
4158,DELPHINE.',"years, had suddenly gone out and left me alone in utter darkness, as"
4159,DELPHINE.',the knowledge was borne in upon me that henceforth Madame de Savaresse
4160,DELPHINE.',had passed altogether and finally out of my life.
4161,DELPHINE.',
4162,DELPHINE.',And so to-morrow--Brussels!

4171,I,
4172,I,"It was in Brittany, and the apples were already acquiring a ruddier,"
4173,I,"autumnal tint, amid their greens and yellows, though Autumn was not"
4174,I,yet; and the country lay very still and fair in the sunset which had
4175,I,"befallen, softly and suddenly as is the fashion there. A man and a"
4176,I,"girl stood looking down in silence at the village, Ploumariel, from"
4177,I,"their post of vantage, half way up the hill: at its lichened church"
4178,I,"spire, dotted with little gables, like dove-cotes; at the slated roof"
4179,I,of its market; at its quiet white houses. The man's eyes rested on it
4180,I,"complacently, with the enjoyment of the painter, finding it charming:"
4181,I,"the girl's, a little absently, as one who had seen it very often"
4182,I,"before. She was pretty and very young, but her gray serious eyes, the"
4183,I,"poise of her head, with its rebellious brown hair braided plainly,"
4184,I,"gave her a little air of dignity, of reserve which sat piquantly upon"
4185,I,"her youth. In one ungloved hand, that was brown from the sun, but very"
4186,I,"beautiful, she held an old parasol, the other played occasionally with"
4187,I,"a bit of purple heather. Presently she began to speak, using English"
4188,I,"just coloured by a foreign accent, that made her speech prettier."
4189,I,
4190,I,"'You make me afraid,' she said, turning her large, troubled eyes on"
4191,I,"her companion, 'you make me afraid, of myself chiefly, but a little of"
4192,I,"you. You suggest so much to me that is new, strange, terrible. When"
4193,I,"you speak, I am troubled; all my old landmarks appear to vanish; I"
4194,I,"even hardly know right from wrong. I love you, my God, how I love you!"
4195,I,"but I want to go away from you and pray in the little quiet church,"
4196,I,where I made my first Communion. I will come to the world's end with
4197,I,"you; but oh, Sebastian, do not ask me, let me go. You will forget me,"
4198,I,"I am a little girl to you, Sebastian. You cannot care very much for"
4199,I,me.'
4200,I,
4201,I,"The man looked down at her, smiling masterfully, but very kindly. He"
4202,I,"took the mutinous hand, with its little sprig of heather, and held it"
4203,I,"between his own. He seemed to find her insistence adorable; mentally,"
4204,I,"he was contrasting her with all other women whom he had known,"
4205,I,frowning at the memory of so many years in which she had no part. He
4206,I,"was a man of more than forty, built large to an uniform English"
4207,I,pattern; there was a touch of military erectness in his carriage which
4208,I,"often deceived people as to his vocation. Actually, he had never been"
4209,I,"anything but artist, though he came of a family of soldiers, and had"
4210,I,once been war correspondent of an illustrated paper. A certain
4211,I,"distinction had always adhered to him, never more than now when he was"
4212,I,"no longer young, was growing bald, had streaks of gray in his"
4213,I,"moustache. His face, without being handsome, possessed a certain"
4214,I,"charm; it was worn and rather pale, the lines about the firm mouth"
4215,I,"were full of lassitude, the eyes rather tired. He had the air of"
4216,I,"having tasted widely, curiously, of life in his day, prosperous as he"
4217,I,"seemed now, that had left its mark upon him. His voice, which usually"
4218,I,"took an intonation that his friends found supercilious, grew very"
4219,I,"tender in addressing this little French girl, with her quaint air of"
4220,I,childish dignity.
4221,I,
4222,I,"'Marie-Yvonne, foolish child, I will not hear one word more. You are a"
4223,I,little heretic; and I am sorely tempted to seal your lips from
4224,I,"uttering heresy. You tell me that you love me, and you ask me to let"
4225,I,"you go, in one breath. The impossible conjuncture! Marie-Yvonne,' he"
4226,I,"added, more seriously, 'trust yourself to me, my child! You know, I"
4227,I,will never give you up. You know that these months that I have been at
4228,I,"Ploumariel, are worth all the rest of my life to me. It has been a"
4229,I,"difficult life, hitherto, little one: change it for me; make it worth"
4230,I,while. You would let morbid fancies come between us. You have lived
4231,I,"overmuch in that little church, with its worm-eaten benches, and its"
4232,I,"mildewed odour of dead people, and dead ideas. Take care,"
4233,I,"Marie-Yvonne: it had made you serious-eyed, before you have learnt to"
4234,I,"laugh; by and by, it will steal away your youth, before you have ever"
4235,I,"been young. I come to claim you, Marie-Yvonne, in the name of Life.'"
4236,I,His words were half-jesting; his eyes were profoundly in earnest. He
4237,I,"drew her to him gently; and when he bent down and kissed her forehead,"
4238,I,"and then her shy lips, she made no resistance: only, a little tremor"
4239,I,"ran through her. Presently, with equal gentleness, he put her away"
4240,I,"from him. 'You have already given me your answer, Marie-Yvonne."
4241,I,"Believe me, you will never regret it. Let us go down.'"
4242,I,
4243,I,They took their way in silence towards the village; presently a bend
4244,I,"of the road hid them from it, and he drew closer to her, helping her"
4245,I,"with his arm over the rough stones. Emerging, they had gone thirty"
4246,I,"yards so, before the scent of English tobacco drew their attention to"
4247,I,"a figure seated by the road-side, under a hedge; they recognised it,"
4248,I,"and started apart, a little consciously."
4249,I,
4250,I,"'It is M. Tregellan,' said the young girl, flushing: 'and he must have"
4251,I,seen us.'
4252,I,
4253,I,"Her companion, frowning, hardly suppressed a little quick objurgation."
4254,I,
4255,I,"'It makes no matter,' he observed, after a moment: 'I shall see your"
4256,I,"uncle to-morrow and we know, good man, how he wishes this; and, in any"
4257,I,"case, I would have told Tregellan.'"
4258,I,
4259,I,"The figure rose, as they drew near: he shook the ashes out of his"
4260,I,"briar, and removed it to his pocket. He was a slight man, with an"
4261,I,"ugly, clever face; his voice as he greeted them, was very low and"
4262,I,pleasant.
4263,I,
4264,I,"'You must have had a charming walk, Mademoiselle. I have seldom seen"
4265,I,Ploumariel look better.'
4266,I,
4267,I,"'Yes,' she said, gravely, 'it has been very pleasant. But I must not"
4268,I,"linger now,' she added breaking a little silence in which none of them"
4269,I,seemed quite at ease. 'My uncle will be expecting me to supper.' She
4270,I,"held out her hand, in the English fashion, to Tregellan, and then to"
4271,I,"Sebastian Murch, who gave the little fingers a private pressure."
4272,I,
4273,I,They had come into the market-place round which most of the houses in
4274,I,Ploumariel were grouped. They watched the young girl cross it briskly;
4275,I,saw her blue gown pass out of sight down a bye street: then they
4276,I,"turned to their own hotel. It was a low, white house, belted half way"
4277,I,"down the front with black stone; a pictorial object, as most Breton"
4278,I,"hostels. The ground floor was a _café_; and, outside it, a bench and"
4279,I,"long stained table enticed them to rest. They sat down, and ordered"
4280,I,"_absinthes_, as the hour suggested: these were brought to them"
4281,I,"presently by an old servant of the house; an admirable figure, with"
4282,I,the white sleeves and apron relieving her linsey dress: with her good
4283,I,"Breton face, and its effective wrinkles. For some time they sat in"
4284,I,"silence, drinking and smoking. The artist appeared to be absorbed in"
4285,I,contemplation of his drink; considering its clouded green in various
4286,I,"lights. After a while the other looked up, and remarked, abruptly."
4287,I,
4288,I,"'I may as well tell you that I happened to overlook you, just now,"
4289,I,unintentionally.'
4290,I,
4291,I,"Sebastian Murch held up his glass, with absent eyes."
4292,I,
4293,I,"'Don't mention it, my dear fellow,' he remarked, at last, urbanely."
4294,I,
4295,I,'I beg your pardon; but I am afraid I must.'
4296,I,
4297,I,He spoke with an extreme deliberation which suggested nervousness;
4298,I,"with the air of a person reciting a little set speech, learnt"
4299,I,"imperfectly: and he looked very straight in front of him, out into the"
4300,I,"street, at two dogs quarrelling over some offal."
4301,I,
4302,I,"'I daresay you will be angry: I can't avoid that; at least, I have"
4303,I,known you long enough to hazard it. I have had it on my mind to say
4304,I,"something. If I have been silent, it hasn't been because I have been"
4305,I,"blind, or approved. I have seen how it was all along. I gathered it"
4306,I,from your letters when I was in England. Only until this afternoon I
4307,I,"did not know how far it had gone, and now I am sorry I did not speak"
4308,I,before.'
4309,I,
4310,I,"He stopped short, as though he expected his friend's subtilty to come"
4311,I,to his assistance; with admissions or recriminations. But the other
4312,I,"was still silent, absent: his face wore a look of annoyed"
4313,I,"indifference. After a while, as Tregellan still halted, he observed"
4314,I,quietly:
4315,I,
4316,I,'You must be a little more explicit. I confess I miss your meaning.'
4317,I,
4318,I,"'Ah, don't be paltry,' cried the other, quickly. 'You know my meaning."
4319,I,"To be very plain, Sebastian, are you quite justified in playing with"
4320,I,"that charming girl, in compromising her?'"
4321,I,
4322,I,"The artist looked up at last, smiling; his expressive mouth was set,"
4323,I,"not angrily, but with singular determination."
4324,I,
4325,I,'With Mademoiselle Mitouard?'
4326,I,
4327,I,'Exactly; with the niece of a man whose guest you have recently been.'
4328,I,
4329,I,"'My dear fellow!' he stopped a little, considering his words: 'You are"
4330,I,hasty and uncharitable for such a very moral person! you jump at
4331,I,"conclusions, Tregellan. I don't, you know, admit your right to"
4332,I,"question me: still, as you have introduced the subject, I may as well"
4333,I,"satisfy you. I have asked Mademoiselle Mitouard to marry me, and she"
4334,I,"has consented, subject to her uncle's approval. And that her uncle,"
4335,I,"who happens to prefer the English method of courtship, is not likely"
4336,I,to refuse.'
4337,I,
4338,I,"The other held his cigar between two fingers, a little away; his"
4339,I,curiously anxious face suggested that the question had become to him
4340,I,one of increased nicety.
4341,I,
4342,I,"'I am sorry,' he said, after a moment; 'this is worse than I imagined;"
4343,I,it's impossible.'
4344,I,
4345,I,"'It is you that are impossible, Tregellan,' said Sebastian Murch. He"
4346,I,"looked at him now, quite frankly, absolutely: his eyes had a defiant"
4347,I,"light in them, as though he hoped to be criticised; wished nothing"
4348,I,"better than to stand on his defence, to argue the thing out. And"
4349,I,"Tregellan sat for a long time without speaking, appreciating his"
4350,I,purpose. It seemed more monstrous the closer he considered it: natural
4351,I,"enough withal, and so, harder to defeat; and yet, he was sure, that"
4352,I,defeated it must be. He reflected how accidental it had all been:
4353,I,"their presence there, in Ploumariel, and the rest! Touring in"
4354,I,"Brittany, as they had often done before, in their habit of old"
4355,I,"friends, they had fallen upon it by chance, a place unknown of Murray;"
4356,I,and the merest chance had held them there. They had slept at the _Lion
4357,I,"d'Or_, voted it magnificently picturesque, and would have gone away"
4358,I,and forgotten it; but the chance of travel had for once defeated them.
4359,I,Hard by they heard of the little votive chapel of Saint Bernard; at
4360,I,the suggestion of their hostess they set off to visit it. It was built
4361,I,"steeply on an edge of rock, amongst odorous pines overhanging a"
4362,I,"ravine, at the bottom of which they could discern a brown torrent"
4363,I,"purling tumidly along. For the convenience of devotees, iron rings, at"
4364,I,"short intervals, were driven into the wall; holding desperately to"
4365,I,"these, the pious pilgrim, at some peril, might compass the circuit;"
4366,I,"saying an oraison to Saint Bernard, and some ten _Aves_. Sebastian,"
4367,I,"who was charmed with the wild beauty of the scene, in a country"
4368,I,"ordinarily so placid, had been seized with a fit of emulation: not in"
4369,I,"any mood of devotion, but for the sake of a wider prospect. Tregellan"
4370,I,"had protested: and the Saint, resenting the purely æsthetic motive of"
4371,I,"the feat, had seemed to intervene. For, half-way round, growing giddy"
4372,I,"may be, the artist had made a false step, lost his hold. Tregellan,"
4373,I,"with a little cry of horror, saw him disappear amidst crumbling mortar"
4374,I,"and uprooted ferns. It was with a sensible relief, for the fall had"
4375,I,"the illusion of great depth, that, making his way rapidly down a"
4376,I,"winding path, he found him lying on a grass terrace, amidst _débris_"
4377,I,"twenty feet lower, cursing his folly, and holding a lamentably"
4378,I,"sprained ankle, but for the rest uninjured! Tregellan had made off in"
4379,I,haste to Ploumariel in search of assistance; and within the hour he
4380,I,had returned with two stalwart Bretons and M. le Docteur Mitouard.
4381,I,
4382,I,"Their tour had been, naturally, drawing to its close. Tregellan indeed"
4383,I,"had an imperative need to be in London within the week. It seemed,"
4384,I,"therefore, a clear dispensation of Providence, that the amiable doctor"
4385,I,"should prove an hospitable person, and one inspiring confidence no"
4386,I,"less. Caring greatly for things foreign, and with an especial passion"
4387,I,"for England, a country whence his brother had brought back a wife; M."
4388,I,le Docteur Mitouard insisted that the invalid could be cared for
4389,I,"properly at his house alone. And there, in spite of protestations,"
4390,I,"earnest from Sebastian, from Tregellan halfhearted, he was installed."
4391,I,"And there, two days later, Tregellan left him with an easy mind;"
4392,I,"bearing away with him, half enviously, the recollection of the young,"
4393,I,"charming face of a girl, the Doctor's niece, as he had seen her"
4394,I,standing by his friend's sofa when he paid his _adieux_; in the
4395,I,"beginnings of an intimacy, in which, as he foresaw, the petulance of"
4396,I,"the invalid, his impatience at an enforced detention, might be"
4397,I,considerably forgot. And all that had been two months ago.
4398,I,
4399,I,
4400,II,II
4401,II,
4402,II,"'I am sorry you don't see it,' continued Tregellan, after a pause, 'to"
4403,II,me it seems impossible; considering your history it takes me by
4404,II,surprise.'
4405,II,
4406,II,The other frowned slightly; finding this persistence perhaps a trifle
4407,II,"crude, he remarked good-humouredly enough:"
4408,II,
4409,II,'Will you be good enough to explain your opposition? Do you object to
4410,II,"the girl? You have been back a week now, during which you have seen"
4411,II,almost as much of her as I.'
4412,II,
4413,II,"'She is a child, to begin with; there is five-and-twenty years'"
4414,II,"disparity between you. But it's the relation I object to, not the"
4415,II,girl. Do you intend to live in Ploumariel?'
4416,II,
4417,II,"Sebastian smiled, with a suggestion of irony."
4418,II,
4419,II,'Not precisely; I think it would interfere a little with my career;
4420,II,why do you ask?'
4421,II,
4422,II,'I imagined not; you will go back to London with your little Breton
4423,II,"wife, who is as charming here as the apple-blossom in her own garden."
4424,II,"You will introduce her to your circle, who will receive her with open"
4425,II,"arms; all the clever bores, who write, and talk, and paint, and are"
4426,II,talked about between Bloomsbury and Kensington. Everybody who is
4427,II,"emancipated will know her, and everybody who has a ""fad""; and they"
4428,II,"will come in a body and emancipate her, and teach her their ""fads.""'"
4429,II,
4430,II,"'That is a caricature of my circle, as you call it, Tregellan! though"
4431,II,I may remind you it is also yours. I think she is being starved in
4432,II,"this corner, spiritually. She has a beautiful soul, and it has had no"
4433,II,"chance. I propose to give it one, and I am not afraid of the result.'"
4434,II,
4435,II,"Tregellan threw away the stump of his cigar into the darkling street,"
4436,II,"with a little gesture of discouragement, of lassitude."
4437,II,
4438,II,"'She has had the chance to become what she is, a perfect thing.'"
4439,II,
4440,II,"'My dear fellow,' exclaimed his friend, 'I could not have said more"
4441,II,myself.'
4442,II,
4443,II,"The other continued, ignoring his interruption."
4444,II,
4445,II,"'She has had great luck. She has been brought up by an old eccentric,"
4446,II,on the English system of growing up as she liked. And no harm has come
4447,II,"of it, at least until it gave you the occasion of making love to her.'"
4448,II,
4449,II,"'You are candid, Tregellan!'"
4450,II,
4451,II,"'Let her go, Sebastian, let her go,' he continued, with increasing"
4452,II,gravity. 'Consider what a transplantation; from this world of
4453,II,Ploumariel where everything is fixed for her by that venerable old
4454,II,"_Curé_, where life is so easy, so ordered, to yours, ours; a world"
4455,II,"without definitions, where everything is an open question.'"
4456,II,
4457,II,"'Exactly,' said the artist, 'why should she be so limited? I would"
4458,II,"give her scope, ideas. I can't see that I am wrong.'"
4459,II,
4460,II,"'She will not accept them, your ideas. They will trouble her, terrify"
4461,II,"her; in the end, divide you. It is not an elastic nature. I have"
4462,II,watched it.'
4463,II,
4464,II,"'At least, allow me to know her,' put in the artist, a little grimly."
4465,II,
4466,II,Tregellan shook his head.
4467,II,
4468,II,'The Breton blood; her English mother: passionate Catholicism! a touch
4469,II,"of Puritan! Have you quite made up your mind, Sebastian?'"
4470,II,
4471,II,"'I made it up long ago, Tregellan!'"
4472,II,
4473,II,"The other looked at him, curiously, compassionately; with a touch of"
4474,II,resentment at what he found his lack of subtilty. Then he said at
4475,II,last:
4476,II,
4477,II,"'I called it impossible; you force me to be very explicit, even cruel."
4478,II,"I must remind you, that you are, of all my friends, the one I value"
4479,II,"most, could least afford to lose.'"
4480,II,
4481,II,'You must be going to say something extremely disagreeable! something
4482,II,"horrible,' said the artist, slowly."
4483,II,
4484,II,"'I am,' said Tregellan, 'but I must say it. Have you explained to"
4485,II,"Mademoiselle, or her uncle, your--your peculiar position?'"
4486,II,
4487,II,"Sebastian was silent for a moment, frowning: the lines about his mouth"
4488,II,grew a little sterner; at last he said coldly:
4489,II,
4490,II,"'If I were to answer, Yes?'"
4491,II,
4492,II,'Then I should understand that there was no further question of your
4493,II,marriage.'
4494,II,
4495,II,"Presently the other commenced in a hard, leaden voice."
4496,II,
4497,II,"'No, I have not told Marie-Yvonne that. I shall not tell her. I have"
4498,II,suffered enough for a youthful folly; an act of mad generosity. I
4499,II,refuse to allow an infamous woman to wreck my future life as she has
4500,II,"disgraced my past. Legally, she has passed out of it; morally,"
4501,II,"legally, she is not my wife. For all I know she may be actually dead.'"
4502,II,
4503,II,"The other was watching his face, very gray and old now, with an"
4504,II,anxious compassion.
4505,II,
4506,II,"'You know she is not dead, Sebastian,' he said simply. Then he added"
4507,II,"very quietly as one breaks supreme bad tidings, 'I must tell you"
4508,II,something which I fear you have not realised. The Catholic Church does
4509,II,"not recognise divorce. If she marry you and find out, rightly or"
4510,II,"wrongly, she will believe that she has been living in sin; some day"
4511,II,she will find it out. No damnable secret like that keeps itself for
4512,II,"ever: an old newspaper, a chance remark from one of your dear friends,"
4513,II,"and the deluge. Do you see the tragedy, the misery of it? By God,"
4514,II,"Sebastian, to save you both somebody shall tell her; and if it be not"
4515,II,"you, it must be I.'"
4516,II,
4517,II,There was extremest peace in the quiet square; the houses seemed
4518,II,"sleepy at last, after a day of exhausting tranquillity, and the"
4519,II,"chestnuts, under which a few children, with tangled hair and fair"
4520,II,"dirty faces, still played. The last glow of the sun fell on the gray"
4521,II,roofs opposite; dying hard it seemed over the street in which the
4522,II,Mitouards lived; and they heard suddenly the tinkle of an _Angelus_
4523,II,bell. Very placid! the place and the few peasants in their pictorial
4524,II,"hats and caps who lingered. Only the two Englishmen sitting, their"
4525,II,"glasses empty, and their smoking over, looking out on it all with"
4526,II,"their anxious faces, brought in a contrasting note of modern life; of"
4527,II,"the complex aching life of cities, with its troubles and its"
4528,II,difficulties.
4529,II,
4530,II,"'Is that your final word, Tregellan?' asked the artist at last, a"
4531,II,little wearily.
4532,II,
4533,II,"'It must be, Sebastian! Believe me, I am infinitely sorry.'"
4534,II,
4535,II,"'Yes, of course,' he answered quickly, acidly; 'well, I will sleep"
4536,II,on it.'
4537,II,
4538,II,
4539,III,III
4540,III,
4541,III,They made their first breakfast in an almost total silence; both wore
4542,III,the bruised harassed air which tells of a night passed without benefit
4543,III,of sleep. Immediately afterwards Murch went out alone: Tregellan could
4544,III,"guess the direction of his visit, but not its object; he wondered if"
4545,III,the artist was making his difficult confession. Presently they brought
4546,III,"him in a pencilled note; he recognised, with some surprise, his"
4547,III,friend's tortuous hand.
4548,III,
4549,III,"'I have considered our conversation, and your unjustifiable"
4550,III,interference. I am entirely in your hands: at the mercy of your
4551,III,"extraordinary notions of duty. Tell her what you will, if you must;"
4552,III,and pave the way to your own success. I shall say nothing; but I swear
4553,III,you love the girl yourself; and are no right arbiter here. Sebastian
4554,III,Murch.'
4555,III,
4556,III,He read the note through twice before he grasped its purport; then sat
4557,III,"holding it in lax fingers, his face grown singularly gray."
4558,III,
4559,III,"'It's not true, it's not true,' he cried aloud, but a moment later"
4560,III,knew himself for a self-deceiver all along. Never had
4561,III,"self-consciousness been more sudden, unexpected, or complete. There"
4562,III,was no more to do or say; this knowledge tied his hands. _Ite! missa
4563,III,est!_...
4564,III,
4565,III,"He spent an hour painfully invoking casuistry, tossed to and fro"
4566,III,"irresolutely, but never for a moment disputing that plain fact which"
4567,III,"Sebastian had so brutally illuminated. Yes! he loved her, had loved"
4568,III,her all along. Marie-Yvonne! how the name expressed her! at once sweet
4569,III,"and serious, arch and sad as her nature. The little Breton wild"
4570,III,flower! how cruel it seemed to gather her! And he could do no more;
4571,III,Sebastian had tied his hands. Things must be! He was a man nicely
4572,III,"conscientious, and now all the elaborate devices of his honour, which"
4573,III,"had persuaded him to a disagreeable interference, were contraposed"
4574,III,"against him. This suspicion of an ulterior motive had altered it, and"
4575,III,"so at last he was left to decide with a sigh, that because he loved"
4576,III,"these two so well, he must let them go their own way to misery."
4577,III,
4578,III,"Coming in later in the day, Sebastian Murch found his friend packing."
4579,III,
4580,III,"'I have come to get your answer,' he said; 'I have been walking about"
4581,III,the hills like a madman for hours. I have not been near her; I am
4582,III,afraid. Tell me what you mean to do?'
4583,III,
4584,III,"Tregellan rose, shrugged his shoulders, pointed to his valise."
4585,III,
4586,III,'God help you both! I would have saved you if you had let me. The
4587,III,Quimperlé _Courrier_ passes in half-an-hour. I am going by it. I shall
4588,III,catch a night train to Paris.'
4589,III,
4590,III,"As Sebastian said nothing; continued to regard him with the same dull,"
4591,III,"anxious gaze, he went on after a moment:"
4592,III,
4593,III,'You did me a grave injustice; you should have known me better than
4594,III,"that. God knows I meant nothing shameful, only the best; the least"
4595,III,misery for you and her.'
4596,III,
4597,III,"'It was true then?' said Sebastian, curiously. His voice was very"
4598,III,cold; Tregellan found him altered. He regarded the thing as it had
4599,III,"been very remote, and outside them both."
4600,III,
4601,III,"'I did not know it then,' said Tregellan, shortly."
4602,III,
4603,III,"He knelt down again and resumed his packing. Sebastian, leaning"
4604,III,"against the bed, watched him with absent intensity, which was yet"
4605,III,"alive to trivial things, and he handed him from time to time a book, a"
4606,III,"brush, which the other packed mechanically with elaborate care. There"
4607,III,"was no more to say, and presently, when the chambermaid entered for"
4608,III,"his luggage, they went down and out into the splendid sunshine,"
4609,III,"silently. They had to cross the Square to reach the carriage, a dusty"
4610,III,"ancient vehicle, hooded, with places for four, which waited outside"
4611,III,"the postoffice. A man in a blue blouse preceded them, carrying"
4612,III,Tregellan's things. From the corner they could look down the road to
4613,III,"Quimperlé, and their eyes both sought the white house of Doctor"
4614,III,"Mitouard, standing back a little in its trim garden, with its one"
4615,III,incongruous apple tree; but there was no one visible.
4616,III,
4617,III,"Presently, Sebastian asked, suddenly:"
4618,III,
4619,III,"'Is it true, that you said last night: divorce to a Catholic--?'"
4620,III,
4621,III,Tregellan interrupted him.
4622,III,
4623,III,"'It is absolutely true, my poor friend.'"
4624,III,
4625,III,"He had climbed into his place at the back, settled himself on the"
4626,III,shiny leather cushion: he appeared to be the only passenger. Sebastian
4627,III,"stood looking drearily in at the window, the glass of which had long"
4628,III,perished.
4629,III,
4630,III,"'I wish I had never known, Tregellan! How could I ever tell her!'"
4631,III,
4632,III,"Inside, Tregellan shrugged his shoulders: not impatiently, or angrily,"
4633,III,but in sheer impotence; as one who gave it up.
4634,III,
4635,III,"'I can't help you,' he said, 'you must arrange it with your own"
4636,III,conscience.'
4637,III,
4638,III,"'Ah, it's too difficult!' cried the other: 'I can't find my way.'"
4639,III,
4640,III,"The driver cracked his whip, suggestively; Sebastian drew back a"
4641,III,little further from the off wheel.
4642,III,
4643,III,"'Well,' said the other, 'if you find it, write and tell me. I am very"
4644,III,"sorry, Sebastian.'"
4645,III,
4646,III,"'Good-bye,' he replied. 'Yes! I will write.'"
4647,III,
4648,III,"The carriage lumbered off, with a lurch to the right, as it turned the"
4649,III,"corner; it rattled down the hill, raising a cloud of white dust. As it"
4650,III,"passed the Mitouards' house, a young girl, in a large straw hat, came"
4651,III,"down the garden, too late to discover whom it contained. She watched"
4652,III,"it out of sight, indifferently, leaning on the little iron gate; then"
4653,III,"she turned, to recognize the long stooping figure of Sebastian Murch,"
4654,III,who advanced to meet her.

4663,I,
4664,I,At my dining-place in old Soho--I call it mine because there was a
4665,I,"time when I became somewhat inveterate there, keeping my napkin"
4666,I,"(changed once a week) in a ring recognisable by myself and the waiter,"
4667,I,"my bottle of Beaune (replenished more frequently), and my accustomed"
4668,I,"seat--at this restaurant of mine, with its confusion of tongues, its"
4669,I,"various, foreign _clientèle_, amid all the coming and going, the"
4670,I,"nightly change of faces, there were some which remained the same,"
4671,I,"persons with whom, though one might never have spoken, one had"
4672,I,nevertheless from the mere continuity of juxtaposition a certain sense
4673,I,of intimacy.
4674,I,
4675,I,"There was one old gentleman in particular, as inveterate as myself,"
4676,I,"who especially aroused my interest. A courteous, punctual, mild old"
4677,I,man with an air which deprecated notice; who conversed each evening
4678,I,"for a minute or two with the proprietor, as he rolled, always at the"
4679,I,"same hour, a valedictory cigarette, in a language that arrested my ear"
4680,I,"by its strangeness; and which proved to be his own, Hungarian; who"
4681,I,"addressed a brief remark to me at times, half apologetically, in the"
4682,I,"precisest of English. We sat next each other at the same table, came"
4683,I,and went at much the same hour; and for a long while our intercourse
4684,I,was restricted to formal courtesies; mutual inquiries after each
4685,I,"other's health, a few urbane strictures on the climate. The little old"
4686,I,"gentleman in spite of his aspect of shabby gentility,--for his coat"
4687,I,"was sadly inefficient, and the nap of his carefully brushed hat did"
4688,I,not indicate prosperity--perhaps even because of this suggestion of
4689,I,"fallen fortunes, bore himself with pathetic erectness, almost"
4690,I,haughtily. He did not seem amenable to advances. It was a long time
4691,I,"before I knew him well enough to value rightly this appearance, the"
4692,I,"timid defences, behind which a very shy and delicate nature took"
4693,I,"refuge from the world's coarse curiosity. I can smile now, with a"
4694,I,"certain sadness, when I remind myself that at one time I was somewhat"
4695,I,in awe of M. Maurice Cristich and his little air of proud humility.
4696,I,"Now that his place in that dim, foreign eating-house knows him no"
4697,I,"more, and his yellow napkin-ring, with its distinguishing number, has"
4698,I,been passed on to some other customer; I have it in my mind to set
4699,I,"down my impressions of him, the short history of our acquaintance. It"
4700,I,began with an exchange of cards; a form to which he evidently attached
4701,I,"a ceremonial value, for after that piece of ritual his manner"
4702,I,"underwent a sensible softening, and he showed by many subtile"
4703,I,"indefinable shades in his courteous address, that he did me the honour"
4704,I,of including me in his friendship. I have his card before me now; a
4705,I,"large, oblong piece of pasteboard, with _M. Maurice Cristich, Theatre"
4706,I,"Royal_, inscribed upon it, amid many florid flourishes. It enabled me"
4707,I,"to form my first definite notion of his calling, upon which I had"
4708,I,"previously wasted much conjecture; though I had all along, and rightly"
4709,I,"as it appeared, associated him in some manner with music."
4710,I,
4711,I,"In time he was good enough to inform me further. He was a musician, a"
4712,I,"violinist; and formerly, and in his own country, he had been a"
4713,I,"composer. But whether for some lack in him of original talent, or of"
4714,I,"patience, whether for some grossness in the public taste, on which the"
4715,I,"nervous delicacy and refinement of his execution was lost, he had not"
4716,I,"continued. He had been driven by poverty to London, had given lessons,"
4717,I,and then for many years had played a second violin in the orchestra of
4718,I,the Opera.
4719,I,
4720,I,"'It is not much, Monsieur!' he observed, deprecatingly, smoothing his"
4721,I,hat with the cuff of his frayed coat-sleeve. 'But it is sufficient;
4722,I,"and I prefer it to teaching. In effect, they are very charming, the"
4723,I,seraphic young girls of your country! But they seem to care little for
4724,I,"music; and I am a difficult master, and have not enough patience."
4725,I,"Once, you see, a long time ago, I had a perfect pupil, and perhaps"
4726,I,"that spoilt me. Yes! I prefer the theatre, though it is less"
4727,I,"profitable. It is not as it once was,' he added, with a half sigh; 'I"
4728,I,"am no longer ambitious. Yes, Monsieur, when I was young, I was"
4729,I,ambitious. I wrote a symphony and several concertos. I even brought
4730,I,"out at Vienna an opera, which I thought would make me famous; but the"
4731,I,"good folk of Vienna did not appreciate me, and they would have none of"
4732,I,"my music. They said it was antiquated, my opera, and absurd; and yet,"
4733,I,"it seemed to me good. I think that Gluck, that great genius, would"
4734,I,have liked it; and that is what I should have wished. Ah! how long ago
4735,I,"it seems, that time when I was ambitious! But you must excuse me,"
4736,I,Monsieur! your good company makes me garrulous. I must be at the
4737,I,"theatre. If I am not in my place at the half-hour, they fine me two"
4738,I,"shillings and sixpence, and that I can ill afford, you know,"
4739,I,Monsieur!'
4740,I,
4741,I,"In spite of his defeats, his long and ineffectual struggle with"
4742,I,"adversity, M. Cristich, I discovered, as our acquaintance ripened, had"
4743,I,none of the spleen and little of the vanity of the unsuccessful
4744,I,artist. He seemed in his forlorn old age to have accepted his
4745,I,"discomfiture with touching resignation, having acquired neither"
4746,I,"cynicism nor indifference. He was simply an innocent old man, in love"
4747,I,"with his violin and with his art, who had acquiesced in"
4748,I,"disappointment; and it was impossible to decide, whether he even"
4749,I,"believed in his talent, or had not silently accredited the verdict of"
4750,I,"musical Vienna, which had condemned his opera in those days when he"
4751,I,was ambitious. The precariousness of the London Opera was the one fact
4752,I,which I ever knew to excite him to expressions of personal resentment.
4753,I,"When its doors were closed, his hard poverty (it was the only occasion"
4754,I,"when he protested against it), drove him, with his dear instrument and"
4755,I,"his accomplished fingers, into the orchestras of lighter houses, where"
4756,I,he was compelled to play music which he despised. He grew silent and
4757,I,"rueful during these periods of irksome servitude, rolled innumerable"
4758,I,"cigarettes, which he smoked with fierceness and great rapidity. When"
4759,I,"dinner was done, he was often volubly indignant, in Hungarian, to the"
4760,I,proprietor. But with the beginning of the season his mood lightened.
4761,I,"He bore himself more sprucely, and would leave me, to assist at a"
4762,I,"representation of _Don Giovanni_, or _Tannhauser_, with a face which"
4763,I,was almost radiant. I had known him a year before it struck me that I
4764,I,should like to see him in his professional capacity. I told him of my
4765,I,"desire a little diffidently, not knowing how my purpose might strike"
4766,I,"him. He responded graciously, but with an air of intrigue, laying a"
4767,I,gentle hand upon my coat sleeve and bidding me wait. A day or two
4768,I,"later, as we sat over our coffee, M. Cristich with an hesitating"
4769,I,urbanity offered me an order.
4770,I,
4771,I,"'If you would do me the honour to accept it, Monsieur! It is a stall,"
4772,I,"and a good one! I have never asked for one before, all these years, so"
4773,I,"they gave it to me easily. You see, I have few friends. It is for"
4774,I,"to-morrow, as you observe, I demanded it especially; it is an occasion"
4775,I,"of great interest to me,--ah! an occasion! You will come?'"
4776,I,
4777,I,"'You are too good, M. Cristich!' I said with genuine gratitude, for"
4778,I,"indeed the gift came in season, the opera being at that time a luxury"
4779,I,I could seldom command. 'Need I say that I shall be delighted? And to
4780,I,"hear Madame Romanoff, a chance one has so seldom!'"
4781,I,
4782,I,"The old gentleman's mild, dull eyes glistened. 'Madame Romanoff!' he"
4783,I,"repeated, 'the marvellous Leonora! yes, yes! She has sung only once"
4784,I,"before in London. Ah, when I remember--' He broke off suddenly. As he"
4785,I,"rose, and prepared for departure, he held my hand a little longer than"
4786,I,"usual, giving it a more intimate pressure."
4787,I,
4788,I,"'My dear young friend, will you think me a presumptuous old man, if I"
4789,I,"ask you to come and see me to-morrow in my apartment, when it is over?"
4790,I,"I will give you a glass of whisky, and we will smoke pipes, and you"
4791,I,shall tell me your impressions--and then I will tell you why to-morrow
4792,I,"I shall be so proud, why I show this emotion.'"
4793,I,
4794,I,
4795,II,II
4796,II,
4797,II,"The Opera was _Fidelio_, that stately, splendid work, whose melody, if"
4798,II,"one may make a pictorial comparison, has something of that rich and"
4799,II,"sun-warm colour which, certainly, on the canvasses of Rubens, affects"
4800,II,"one as an almost musical quality. It offered brilliant opportunities,"
4801,II,"and the incomparable singer had wasted none of them. So that when, at"
4802,II,"last, I pushed my way out of the crowded house and joined M. Cristich"
4803,II,"at the stage door, where he waited with eyes full of expectancy, the"
4804,II,"music still lingered about me, like the faint, past fragrance of"
4805,II,"incense, and I had no need to speak my thanks. He rested a light hand"
4806,II,"on my arm, and we walked towards his lodging silently; the musician"
4807,II,"carrying his instrument in its sombre case, and shivering from time to"
4808,II,"time, a tribute to the keen spring night. He stooped as he walked, his"
4809,II,eyes trailing the ground; and a certain listlessness in his manner
4810,II,"struck me a little strangely, as though he came fresh from some solemn"
4811,II,"or hieratic experience, of which the reaction had already begun to set"
4812,II,"in tediously, leaving him at the last unstrung and jaded, a little"
4813,II,"weary, of himself and the too strenuous occasion. It was not until we"
4814,II,"had crossed the threshold of a dingy, high house in a byway of"
4815,II,"Bloomsbury, and he had ushered me, with apologies, into his shabby"
4816,II,"room, near the sky, that the sense of his hospitable duties seemed to"
4817,II,renovate him. He produced tumblers from an obscure recess behind his
4818,II,"bed; set a kettle on the fire, a lodging-house fire, which scarcely"
4819,II,"smouldered with flickers of depressing, sulphurous flame, talking of"
4820,II,"indifferent subjects, as he watched for it to boil."
4821,II,
4822,II,"Only when we had settled ourselves, in uneasy chairs, opposite each"
4823,II,"other, and he had composed me, what he termed 'a grog': himself"
4824,II,"preferring the more innocent mixture known as _eau sucrée_, did he"
4825,II,allude to _Fidelio_. I praised heartily the discipline of the
4826,II,"orchestra, the prima donna, whom report made his country-woman, with"
4827,II,"her strong, sweet voice and her extraordinary beauty, the magnificence"
4828,II,"of the music, the fine impression of the whole."
4829,II,
4830,II,"M. Cristich, his glass in hand, nodded approval. He looked intently"
4831,II,"into the fire, which cast mocking shadows over his quaint, incongruous"
4832,II,"figure, his antiquated dress coat, which seemed to skimp him, his"
4833,II,"frost-bitten countenance, his cropped grey hair. 'Yes,' he said, 'Yes!"
4834,II,"So it pleased you, and you thought her beautiful? I am glad.'"
4835,II,
4836,II,"He turned round to me abruptly, and laid a thin hand impressively on"
4837,II,my knee.
4838,II,
4839,II,"'You know I invented her, the Romanoff, discovered her, taught her all"
4840,II,"she learnt. Yes, Monsieur, I was proud to-night, very proud, to be"
4841,II,"there, playing for her, though she did not know. Ah! the beautiful"
4842,II,creature!... and how badly I played! execrably! You could not notice
4843,II,"that, Monsieur, but they did, my confrères, and could not understand."
4844,II,"How should they? How should they dream, that I, Maurice Cristich,"
4845,II,"second violin in the orchestra of the opera, had to do with the"
4846,II,"Leonora; even I! Her voice thrilled them; ah, but it was I who taught"
4847,II,"her her notes! They praised her diamonds; yes, but once I gave her"
4848,II,"that she wanted more than diamonds, bread, and lodging and love."
4849,II,"Beautiful they called her; she was beautiful too, when I carried her"
4850,II,"in my arms through Vienna. I am an old man now, and good for very"
4851,II,"little; and there have been days, God forgive me! when I have been"
4852,II,"angry with her; but it was not to-night. To see her there, so"
4853,II,"beautiful and so great; and to feel that after all I had a hand in it,"
4854,II,"that I invented her. Yes, yes! I had my victory to-night too; though"
4855,II,"it was so private; a secret between you and me, Monsieur? Is it not?'"
4856,II,
4857,II,"I assured him of my discretion, but he hardly seemed to hear. His sad"
4858,II,"eyes had wandered away to the live coals, and he considered them"
4859,II,"pensively, as though he found them full of charming memories. I sat"
4860,II,"back, respecting his remoteness; but my silence was replete with"
4861,II,"surprised conjecture, and indeed the quaint figure of the old"
4862,II,"musician, every line of his garments redolent of ill success, had"
4863,II,"become to me, of a sudden, strangely romantic. Destiny, so amorous of"
4864,II,"surprises, of pathetic or cynical contrasts, had in this instance"
4865,II,"excelled herself. My obscure acquaintance, Maurice Cristich! The"
4866,II,renowned Romanoff! Her name and acknowledged genius had been often in
4867,II,"men's mouths of late, a certain luminous, scarcely sacred, glamour"
4868,II,"attaching to it, in an hundred idle stories, due perhaps as much to"
4869,II,"the wonder of her sorrowful beauty, as to any justification in"
4870,II,"knowledge, of her boundless extravagance, her magnificent fantasies,"
4871,II,"her various perversity, rumour pointing specially at those priceless"
4872,II,"diamonds, the favours not altogether gratuitous it was said of exalted"
4873,II,"personages. And with all deductions made, for malice, for the"
4874,II,"ingenuity of the curious, the impression of her perversity was left;"
4875,II,"she remained enigmatical and notorious, a somewhat scandalous heroine!"
4876,II,"And Cristich had known her; he had, as he declared, and his accent was"
4877,II,"not that of bragadoccio, invented her. The conjuncture puzzled and"
4878,II,"fascinated me. It did not make Cristich less interesting, nor the"
4879,II,prima-donna more perspicuous.
4880,II,
4881,II,By-and-by the violinist looked up at me; he smiled with a little dazed
4882,II,"air, as though his thoughts had been a far journey."
4883,II,
4884,II,"'Pardon me, Monsieur! I beg you to fill your glass. I seem a poor"
4885,II,"host; but to tell you the truth, I was dreaming; I was quite away,"
4886,II,quite away.'
4887,II,
4888,II,"He threw out his hands, with a vague expansive gesture."
4889,II,
4890,II,"'Dear child!' he said to the flames, in French; 'good little one! I do"
4891,II,not forget thee.' And he began to tell me.
4892,II,
4893,II,"'It was when I was at Vienna, ah! a long while ago. I was not rich,"
4894,II,"but neither was I very poor; I still had my little patrimony, and I"
4895,II,"lived in the ---- Strasse, very economically; it is a quarter which"
4896,II,"many artists frequent. I husbanded my resources, that I might be able"
4897,II,to work away at my art without the tedium of making it a means of
4898,II,"livelihood. I refused many offers to play in public, that I might have"
4899,II,"more leisure. I should not do that now; but then, I was very"
4900,II,confident; I had great faith in me. And I worked very hard at my
4901,II,"symphony, and I was full of desire to write an opera. It was a tall"
4902,II,"dark house, where I lived; there were many other lodgers, but I knew"
4903,II,scarcely any of them. I went about with my head full of music and I
4904,II,"had my violin; I had no time to seek acquaintance. Only my neighbour,"
4905,II,"at the other side of my passage, I knew slightly and bowed to him when"
4906,II,"we met on the stairs. He was a dark, lean man, of a very distinguished"
4907,II,"air; he must have lived very hard, he had death in his face. He was"
4908,II,"not an artist, like the rest of us: I suspect he was a great"
4909,II,"profligate, and a gambler; but he had the manners of a gentleman. And"
4910,II,"when I came to talk to him, he displayed the greatest knowledge of"
4911,II,music that I have ever known. And it was the same with all; he talked
4912,II,"divinely, of everything in the world, but very wildly and bitterly. He"
4913,II,"seemed to have been everywhere, and done everything; and at last to be"
4914,II,tired of it all; and of himself the most. From the people of the house
4915,II,"I heard that he was a Pole; noble, and very poor; and, what surprised"
4916,II,"me, that he had a daughter with him, a little girl. I used to pity"
4917,II,"this child, who must have lived quite alone. For the Count was always"
4918,II,"out, and the child never appeared with him; and, for the rest, with"
4919,II,"his black spleen and tempers, he must have been but sorry company for"
4920,II,"a little girl. I wished much to see her, for you see, Monsieur! I am"
4921,II,"fond of children, almost as much as of music; and one day it came"
4922,II,about. I was at home with my violin; I had been playing all the
4923,II,evening some songs I had made; and once or twice I had seemed to be
4924,II,"interrupted by little, tedious sounds. At last I stopped, and opened"
4925,II,"the door; and there, crouching down, I found the most beautiful little"
4926,II,creature I had ever seen in my life. It was the child of my neighbour.
4927,II,"Yes, Monsieur! you divine, you divine! That was the Leonora!'"
4928,II,
4929,II,"'And she is not your compatriot,' I asked."
4930,II,
4931,II,"'A Hungarian? ah, no! yet every piece of her pure Slav. But I weary"
4932,II,"you, Monsieur; I make a long story.'"
4933,II,
4934,II,I protested my interest; and after a little side glance of dubious
4935,II,"scrutiny, he continued in a constrained monotone, as one who told over"
4936,II,to himself some rosary of sad enchanting memories.
4937,II,
4938,II,"'Ah, yes! she was beautiful; that mysterious, sad Slavonic beauty! a"
4939,II,"thing quite special and apart. And, as a child, it was more tragical"
4940,II,and strange; that dusky hair! those profound and luminous eyes!
4941,II,"seeming to mourn over tragedies they have never known. A strange,"
4942,II,"wild, silent child! She might have been eight or nine, then; but her"
4943,II,little soul was hungry for music. It was a veritable passion; and when
4944,II,"she became at last my good friend, she told me how often she had lain"
4945,II,"for long hours outside my door, listening to my violin. I gave her a"
4946,II,"kind of scolding, such as one could to so beautiful a little creature,"
4947,II,"for the passage was draughty and cold, and sent her away with some"
4948,II,"_bon-bons_. She shook back her long, dark hair: 'You are not angry,"
4949,II,"and I am not naughty,' she said: 'and I shall come back. I thank you"
4950,II,"for your _bon-bons_; but I like your music better than _bon-bons_, or"
4951,II,"fairy tales, or anything in the world.'"
4952,II,
4953,II,"'But she never came back to the passage again, Monsieur! The next time"
4954,II,"I came across the Count, I sent her an invitation, a little"
4955,II,"diffidently, for he had never spoken to me of her, and he was a"
4956,II,"strange and difficult man. Now, he simply shrugged his shoulders, with"
4957,II,"a smile, in which, for once, there seemed more entertainment than"
4958,II,malice. The child could visit me when she chose; if it amused either
4959,II,"of us, so much the better. And we were content, and she came to me"
4960,II,"often; after a while, indeed, she was with me almost always. Child as"
4961,II,"she was, she had already the promise of her magnificent voice; and I"
4962,II,"taught her to use it, to sing, and to play on the piano and on the"
4963,II,"violin, to which she took the most readily. She was like a singing"
4964,II,"bird in the room, such pure, clear notes! And she grew very fond of"
4965,II,"me; she would fall asleep at last in my arms, and so stay until the"
4966,II,"Count would take her with him when he entered, long after midnight. He"
4967,II,came to me naturally for her soon; and they never seemed long those
4968,II,hours that I watched over her sleep. I never knew him harsh or unkind
4969,II,to the child; he seemed simply indifferent to her as to everything
4970,II,else. He had exhausted life and he hated it; and he knew that death
4971,II,"was on him, and he hated that even more. And yet he was careful of her"
4972,II,"after a fashion, buying her _bon-bons_ and little costumes, when he"
4973,II,"was in the vein, pitching his voice softly when he would stay and talk"
4974,II,"to me, as though he relished her sleep. One night he did not come to"
4975,II,"fetch her at all, I had wrapped a blanket round the child where she"
4976,II,"lay on my bed, and had sat down to watch by her and presently I too"
4977,II,fell asleep. I do not know how long I slept but when I woke there was
4978,II,"a gray light in the room, I was very cold and stiff, but I could hear"
4979,II,"close by, the soft, regular breathing of the child. There was a great"
4980,II,"uneasiness on me, and after a while I stole out across the passage and"
4981,II,"knocked at the Count's door, there was no answer but it gave when I"
4982,II,"tried it, and so I went in. The lamp had smouldered out, there was a"
4983,II,"sick odour of _pétrol_ everywhere, and the shutters were closed: but"
4984,II,through the chinks the merciless gray dawn streamed in and showed me
4985,II,the Count sitting very still by the table. His face wore a most
4986,II,"curious smile, and had not his great cavernous eyes been open, I"
4987,II,should have believed him asleep: suddenly it came to me that he was
4988,II,"dead. He was not a good man, monsieur, nor an amiable, but a true"
4989,II,"_virtuoso_ and full of information, and I grieved. I have had Masses"
4990,II,said for the repose of his soul.'
4991,II,
4992,II,"He paid a tribute of silence to the dead man's memory, and then he"
4993,II,went on.
4994,II,
4995,II,'It seemed quite natural that I should take his child. There was no
4996,II,"one to care, no one to object; it happened quite easily. We went, the"
4997,II,"little one and I, to another part of the city. We made quite a new"
4998,II,life. Oh! my God! it is a very long time ago.'
4999,II,
5000,II,"Quite suddenly his voice went tremulous; but after a pause, hardly"
5001,II,"perceptible, he recovered himself and continued with an accent of"
5002,II,apology.
5003,II,
5004,II,"'I am a foolish old man, and very garrulous. It is not good to think"
5005,II,"of that, nor to talk of it; I do not know why I do. But what would you"
5006,II,"have? She loved me then, and she had the voice and the disposition of"
5007,II,"an angel. I have never been very happy. I think sometimes, monsieur,"
5008,II,"that we others, who care much for art, are not permitted that. But"
5009,II,"certainly those few, rapid days, when she was a child, were good; and"
5010,II,yet they were the days of my defeat. I found myself out then. I was
5011,II,"never to be a great artist, a _maestro_: a second-rate man, a good"
5012,II,"music-teacher for young ladies, a capable performer in an orchestra,"
5013,II,"what you will, but a great artist, never! Yet in those days, even when"
5014,II,"my opera failed, I had consolation, I could say, I have a child! I"
5015,II,"would have kept her with me always but it could not be, from the very"
5016,II,first she would be a singer. I knew always that a day would come when
5017,II,"she would not need me, she was meant to be the world's delight, and I"
5018,II,"had no right to keep her, even if I could. I held my beautiful,"
5019,II,"strange bird in her cage, until she beat her wings against the bars,"
5020,II,"then I opened the door. At the last, I think, that is all we can do"
5021,II,"for our children, our best beloved, our very heart-strings, stand free"
5022,II,"of them, let them go. The world is very weary, but we must all find"
5023,II,"that out for ourselves, perhaps when they are tired they will come"
5024,II,"home, perhaps not, perhaps not. It was to the Conservatoire, at Milan,"
5025,II,"that I sent her finally, and it was at La Scala that she afterwards"
5026,II,"appeared, and at La Scala too, poor child, she met her evil genius,"
5027,II,"the man named Romanoff, a baritone in her company, own son of the"
5028,II,"devil, whom she married. Ah, if I could have prevented it, if I could"
5029,II,have prevented it!'
5030,II,
5031,II,He lapsed into a long silence; a great weariness seemed to have come
5032,II,"over him, and in the gray light which filtered in through the dingy"
5033,II,"window blinds, his face was pinched and wasted, unutterably old and"
5034,II,forlorn.
5035,II,
5036,II,"'But I did not prevent it,' he said at last, 'for all my good will,"
5037,II,perhaps merely hastened it by unseasonable interference. And so we
5038,II,"went in different ways, with anger I fear, and at least with sore"
5039,II,hearts and misunderstanding.'
5040,II,
5041,II,"He spoke with an accent of finality, and so sadly that in a sudden"
5042,II,rush of pity I was moved to protest.
5043,II,
5044,II,"'But, surely you meet sometimes; surely this woman, who was as your"
5045,II,own child--'
5046,II,
5047,II,"He stopped me with a solemn, appealing gesture."
5048,II,
5049,II,"'You are young, and you do not altogether understand. You must not"
5050,II,"judge her; you must not believe, that she forgets, that she does not"
5051,II,"care. Only, it is better like this, because it could never be as"
5052,II,"before. I could not help her. I want nothing that she can give me, no"
5053,II,"not anything; I have my memories! I hear of her, from time to time; I"
5054,II,"hear what the world says of her, the imbecile world, and I smile. Do I"
5055,II,"not know best? I, who carried her in my arms, when she was that high!'"
5056,II,
5057,II,"And in effect the old violinist smiled, it was as though he had"
5058,II,"surprised my secret of dissatisfaction, and found it, like the malice"
5059,II,"of the world, too ignorant to resent. The edge of his old, passionate"
5060,II,adoration had remained bright and keen through the years; and it
5061,II,"imparted a strange brilliancy to his eyes, which half convinced me, as"
5062,II,"presently, with a resumption of his usual air of diffident courtesy,"
5063,II,"he ushered me out into the vague, spring dawn. And yet, when I had"
5064,II,parted from him and was making my way somewhat wearily to my own
5065,II,"quarters, my first dubious impression remained. My imagination was"
5066,II,"busy with the story I had heard, striving quite vainly to supply"
5067,II,"omissions, to fill in meagre outlines. Yes! quite vainly! the figure"
5068,II,"of the Romanoff was left, ambiguous and unexplained; hardly acquitted"
5069,II,"in my mind of a certain callousness, an ingratitude almost vulgar as"
5070,II,"it started out from time to time, in contraposition against that"
5071,II,forlorn old age.
5072,II,
5073,II,
5074,III,III
5075,III,
5076,III,"I saw him once more at the little restaurant in Soho, before a sudden"
5077,III,"change of fortune, calling me abroad for an absence, as it happened,"
5078,III,"of years, closed the habit of our society. He gave me the god-speed of"
5079,III,"a brother artist, though mine was not the way of music, with many"
5080,III,"prophesies of my success; and the pressure of his hand, as he took"
5081,III,"leave of me, was tremulous."
5082,III,
5083,III,"'I am an old man, monsieur, and we may not meet again, in this world."
5084,III,I wish you all the chances you deserve in Paris; but I--I shall
5085,III,"greatly miss you. If you come back in time, you will find me in the"
5086,III,"old places; and if not--there are things of mine, which I should wish"
5087,III,"you to have, that shall be sent you.'"
5088,III,
5089,III,And indeed it proved to be our last meeting. I went to Paris; a fitful
5090,III,"correspondence intervened, grew infrequent, ceased; then a little"
5091,III,"later, came to me the notification, very brief and official, of his"
5092,III,death in the French Hospital of pneumonia. It was followed by a few
5093,III,"remembrances of him, sent at his request, I learnt, by the priest who"
5094,III,had administered to him the last offices: some books that he had
5095,III,"greatly cherished, works of Glück, for the most part; an antique ivory"
5096,III,"crucifix of very curious workmanship; and his violin, a beautiful"
5097,III,"instrument dated 1670 and made at Nuremberg, yet with a tone which"
5098,III,"seemed to me, at least, as fine as that of the Cremonas. It had an"
5099,III,"intrinsic value to me, apart from its associations; for I too was"
5100,III,"something of an amateur, and since this seasoned melodious wood had"
5101,III,"come into my possession, I was inspired to take my facility more"
5102,III,"seriously. To play in public, indeed, I had neither leisure nor"
5103,III,"desire: but in certain _salons_ of my acquaintance, where music was"
5104,III,"much in vogue, I made from time to time a desultory appearance. I set"
5105,III,"down these facts, because as it happened, this ineffectual talent of"
5106,III,"mine, which poor Cristich's legacy had recalled to life, was to"
5107,III,"procure me an interesting encounter. I remember the occasion well, it"
5108,III,was too appropriate to be forgotten--as though my old friend's
5109,III,"lifeless fiddle, which had yet survived so many _maestri_, was to be a"
5110,III,"direct instrument of the completion of his story, the resurrection of"
5111,III,those dormant and unsatisfied curiosities which still now and again
5112,III,concerned me. I had played at an house where I was a stranger; brought
5113,III,"there by a friend, to whose insistence I had yielded somewhat"
5114,III,"reluctantly; although he had assured me, and, I believe, with reason,"
5115,III,"that it was a house where the indirect, or Attic invitation greatly"
5116,III,"prevailed, in brief, a place where one met very queer people. The"
5117,III,"hostess was American, a charming woman, of unimpeachable antecedents;"
5118,III,"but her passion for society, which, while it should always be"
5119,III,"interesting, was not always equally reputable, had exposed her"
5120,III,evenings to the suspicion of her compatriots. And when I had
5121,III,"discharged my part in the programme and had leisure to look around me,"
5122,III,I saw at a glance that their suspicion was justified; very queer
5123,III,people indeed were there. The large hot rooms were cosmopolitan:
5124,III,"infidels and Jews, everybody and nobody; a scandalously promiscuous"
5125,III,"assemblage! And there, with a half start, which was not at first"
5126,III,"recognition, my eyes stopped before a face which brought to me a"
5127,III,confused rush of memories. It was that of a woman who sat on an
5128,III,ottoman in the smallest room which was almost empty. Her companion was
5129,III,"a small, vivacious man with a gray imperial, and the red ribbon in his"
5130,III,"buttonhole, to whose continuous stream of talk, eked out with"
5131,III,"meridional gestures, she had the air of being listlessly resigned. Her"
5132,III,"dress, a marvel of discretion, its colour the yellow of old ivory, was"
5133,III,"of some very rich and stiff stuff cut square to her neck; that, and"
5134,III,"her great black hair, clustered to a crimson rose at the top of her"
5135,III,"head, made the pallor of her face a thing to marvel at. Her beauty was"
5136,III,"at once sombre and illuminating, and youthful no less. The woman of"
5137,III,"thirty: but her complexion, and her arms, which were bare, were soft"
5138,III,in texture as a young girl's.
5139,III,
5140,III,"I made my way as well as I could for the crowd, to my hostess,"
5141,III,"listened, with what patience I might, to some polite praise of my"
5142,III,"playing, and made my request."
5143,III,
5144,III,"'Mrs. Destrier, I have an immense favour to ask; introduce me to"
5145,III,Madame Romanoff!'
5146,III,
5147,III,"She gave me a quick, shrewd smile; then I remembered stories of her"
5148,III,intimate quaintness.
5149,III,
5150,III,"'My dear young man! I have no objection. Only I warn you, she is not"
5151,III,"conversational; you will make no good of it, and you will be"
5152,III,"disappointed; perhaps that will be best. Please remember, I am"
5153,III,responsible for nobody.'
5154,III,
5155,III,'Is she so dangerous?' I asked. 'But never mind; I believe that I have
5156,III,something to say which may interest her.'
5157,III,
5158,III,"'Oh, for that!' she smiled elliptically; 'yes, she is most dangerous."
5159,III,But I will introduce you; you shall tell me how you succeed.'
5160,III,
5161,III,I bowed and smiled; she laid a light hand on my arm; and I piloted her
5162,III,to the desired corner. It seemed that the chance was with me. The
5163,III,little fluent Provençal had just vacated his seat; and when the
5164,III,"prima-donna had acknowledged the hasty mention of my name, with a bare"
5165,III,"inclination of her head, I was emboldened to succeed to it. And then I"
5166,III,"was silent. In the perfection of that dolorous face, I could not but"
5167,III,be reminded of the tradition which has always ascribed something fatal
5168,III,and inevitable to the possession of great gifts: of genius or uncommon
5169,III,"fortune, or singular personal beauty; and the common-place of"
5170,III,conversation failed me.
5171,III,
5172,III,"After a while she looked askance at me, with a sudden flash of"
5173,III,resentment.
5174,III,
5175,III,"'You speak no French, Monsieur! And yet you write it well enough; I"
5176,III,have read your stories.'
5177,III,
5178,III,"I acknowledged Madame's irony, permitted myself to hope that my"
5179,III,efforts had met with Madame's approval.
5180,III,
5181,III,'_A la bonne heure!_ I perceive you also speak it. Is that why you
5182,III,"wished to be presented, to hear my criticisms?'"
5183,III,
5184,III,'Let me answer that question when you have answered mine.'
5185,III,
5186,III,"She glanced curiously over her feathered fan, then with the slightest"
5187,III,upward inclination of her statuesque shoulders--'I admire your books;
5188,III,but are your women quite just? I prefer your playing.'
5189,III,
5190,III,"'That is better, Madame! It was to talk of that I came.'"
5191,III,
5192,III,'Your playing?'
5193,III,
5194,III,'My violin.'
5195,III,
5196,III,'You want me to look at it? It is a Cremona?'
5197,III,
5198,III,"'It is not a Cremona; but if you like, I will give it you.'"
5199,III,
5200,III,Her dark eyes shone out in amazed amusement.
5201,III,
5202,III,"'You are eccentric, Monsieur! but your nation has a privilege of"
5203,III,"eccentricity. At least, you amuse me; and I have wearied myself enough"
5204,III,this long evening. Show me your violin; I am something of a
5205,III,_virtuosa_.'
5206,III,
5207,III,"I took the instrument from its case, handed it to her in silence,"
5208,III,watching her gravely. She received it with the dexterous hands of a
5209,III,"musician, looked at the splendid stains on the back, then bent over"
5210,III,"towards the light in a curious scrutiny of the little, faded signature"
5211,III,"of its maker, the _fecit_ of an obscure Bavarian of the seventeenth"
5212,III,century; and it was a long time before she raised her eyes.
5213,III,
5214,III,"When she spoke, her rich voice had a note of imperious entreaty in it."
5215,III,"'Your violin interests me, Monsieur! Oh, I know that wood! It came to"
5216,III,you--?'
5217,III,
5218,III,'A legacy from an esteemed friend.'
5219,III,
5220,III,She shot back. 'His name?' with the flash which I waited for.
5221,III,
5222,III,"'Maurice Cristich, Madame!'"
5223,III,
5224,III,"We were deserted in our corner. The company had strayed in, one by"
5225,III,"one, to the large _salon_ with the great piano, where a young Russian"
5226,III,"musician, a pupil of Chopin, sat down to play, with no conventional"
5227,III,"essay of preliminary chords, an expected morsel. The strains of it"
5228,III,"wailed in just then, through the heavy, screening curtains; a mad"
5229,III,"_valse_ of his own, that no human feet could dance to, a pitiful,"
5230,III,"passionate thing that thrilled the nerves painfully, ringing the"
5231,III,"changes between voluptuous sorrow and the merriment of devils, and"
5232,III,"burdened always with the weariness of 'all the Russias,' the proper"
5233,III,"_Welt-schmerz_ of a young, disconsolate people. It seemed to charge"
5234,III,"the air, like electricity, with passionate undertones; it gave"
5235,III,"intimate facilities, and a tense personal note to our interview."
5236,III,
5237,III,"'A legacy! so he is gone.' She swayed to me with a wail in her voice,"
5238,III,in a sort of childish abandonment: 'and _you_ tell me! Ah!' she drew
5239,III,"back, chilling suddenly with a touch of visible suspicion. 'You hurt"
5240,III,"me, Monsieur! Is it a stroke at random? You spoke of a gift; you say"
5241,III,"you knew, esteemed him. You were with him? Perhaps, a message ...?'"
5242,III,
5243,III,"'He died alone, Madame! I have no message. If there were none, it"
5244,III,"might be, perhaps, that he believed you had not cared for it. If that"
5245,III,"were wrong, I could tell you that you were not forgotten. Oh! he loved"
5246,III,"you! I had his word for it, and the story. The violin is yours--do not"
5247,III,"mistake me; it is not for your sake but his. He died alone; value it,"
5248,III,"as I should, Madame!'"
5249,III,
5250,III,"They were insolent words, perhaps cruel, provoked from me by the mixed"
5251,III,nature of my attraction to her; the need of turning a reasonable and
5252,III,"cool front to that pathetic beauty, that artful music, which whipped"
5253,III,"jaded nerves to mutiny. The arrow in them struck so true, that I was"
5254,III,"shocked at my work. It transfixed the child in her, latent in most"
5255,III,"women, which moaned at my feet; so that for sheer shame as though it"
5256,III,"were actually a child I had hurt, I could have fallen and kissed her"
5257,III,hands.
5258,III,
5259,III,"'Oh, you judge me hard, you believe the worst of me and why not? I am"
5260,III,"against the world! At least he might have taught you to be generous,"
5261,III,that kind old man! Have I forgotten do you think! Am I so happy then?
5262,III,"Oh it is a just question, the world busies itself with me, and you are"
5263,III,"in the lap of its tongues. Has it ever accused me of that, of"
5264,III,"happiness? Cruel, cruel! I have paid my penalties, and a woman is not"
5265,III,"free to do as she will, but would not I have gone to him, for a word,"
5266,III,"a sign? Yes, for the sake of my childhood. And to-night when you"
5267,III,"showed me that,' her white hand swept over the violin with something"
5268,III,"of a caress, 'I thought it had come, yes, from the grave, and you make"
5269,III,it more bitter by readings of your own. You strike me hard.'
5270,III,
5271,III,"I bent forward in real humility, her voice had tears in it, though her"
5272,III,splendid eyes were hard.
5273,III,
5274,III,"'Forgive me, Madame! a vulgar stroke at random. I had no right to make"
5275,III,"it, he told me only good of you. Forgive me, and for proof of your"
5276,III,pardon--I am serious now--take his violin.'
5277,III,
5278,III,"Her smile, as she refused me, was full of sad dignity."
5279,III,
5280,III,"'You have made it impossible, Monsieur! It would remind me only now of"
5281,III,how ill you think of me. I beg you to keep it.'
5282,III,
5283,III,"The music had died away suddenly, and its ceasing had been followed by"
5284,III,"a loud murmur of applause. The prima-donna rose, and stood for a"
5285,III,"moment observing me, irresolutely."
5286,III,
5287,III,"'I leave you and your violin, Monsieur! I have to sing presently, with"
5288,III,such voice as our talk has left me. I bid you both adieu!'
5289,III,
5290,III,"'Ah, Madame!' I deprecated, 'you will think again of this, I will send"
5291,III,it you in the morning. I have no right....'
5292,III,
5293,III,"She shook her head, then with a sudden flash of amusement, or"
5294,III,"fantasy--'I agree, Monsieur! on a condition. To prove your penitence,"
5295,III,you shall bring it to me yourself.'
5296,III,
5297,III,I professed that her favour overpowered me. She named an hour when she
5298,III,"would be at home: an address in the Avenue des Champs Elysées, which I"
5299,III,noted on my tablets.
5300,III,
5301,III,"'Not adieu then, Monsieur! but _au revoir_.'"
5302,III,
5303,III,"I bowed perplexedly, holding the curtain aside to let her sweep"
5304,III,"through; and once more she turned back, gathering up her voluminous"
5305,III,"train, to repeat with a glance and accent, which I found mystifying:"
5306,III,"'Remember, Monsieur! It is only _au revoir_.'"
5307,III,
5308,III,"That last glimpse of her, with the strange mockery and an almost"
5309,III,"elfish malice in her fine eyes, went home with me later to cause vague"
5310,III,disquiet and fresh suspicion of her truth. The spell of her
5311,III,"extraordinary, personal charm removed, doubt would assert itself. Was"
5312,III,she quite sincere? Was her fascination not a questionable one? Might
5313,III,"not that almost childish outburst of a grief so touching, and at the"
5314,III,"time convincing, be after all factitious; the movement of a born"
5315,III,"actress and enchantress of men, quick to seize as by a nice"
5316,III,professional instinct the opportunity of an effect? Had her whole
5317,III,"attitude been a deliberate pose, a sort of trick? The sudden changes"
5318,III,"in her subtile voice, the under current of mockery in an invitation"
5319,III,"which seemed inconsequent, put me on my guard, reinforced all my"
5320,III,deep-seated prejudices against the candor of the feminine soul. It
5321,III,"left me with a vision of her, fantastically vivid, raccounting to an"
5322,III,"intimate circle, to an accompaniment of some discreet laughter and the"
5323,III,"popping of champagne corks, the success of her imposition, the"
5324,III,sentimental concessions which she had extorted from a notorious
5325,III,student of cynical moods.
5326,III,
5327,III,"A dangerous woman! cried Mrs. Destrier with the world, which might"
5328,III,"conceivably be right; at least I was fain to add, a woman whose"
5329,III,"laughter would be merciless. Certainly, I had no temper for"
5330,III,adventures; and a visit to Madame Romanoff on so sentimental an errand
5331,III,"seemed to me, the more I pondered it, to partake of this quality to be"
5332,III,"rich in distasteful possibilities. Must I write myself pusillanimous,"
5333,III,"if I confess that I never made it, that I committed my old friend's"
5334,III,violin into the hands of the woman who had been his pupil by the
5335,III,vulgar aid of a _commissionaire_?
5336,III,
5337,III,"Pusillanimous or simply prudent; or perhaps cruelly unjust, to a"
5338,III,person who had paid penalties and greatly needed kindness? It is a
5339,III,"point I have never been able to decide, though I have tried to raise"
5340,III,theories on the ground of her acquiescence. It seemed to me on the
5341,III,"cards, that my fiddle bestowed so cavalierly, should be refused. And"
5342,III,"yet even the fact of her retaining it is open to two interpretations,"
5343,III,and Cristich testified for her. Maurice Cristich! Madame Romanoff! the
5344,III,"renowned Romanoff, Maurice Cristich! Have I been pusillanimous,"
5345,III,prudent or merely cruel? For the life of me I cannot say!

5373,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"to-morrow hundreds of people will be turned away, for want of space,"
5374,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"from the Hall where I am to play, just I alone, my last Fantaisie, it"
5375,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"was not so very many years ago that I trudged along, fiddling for"
5376,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,half-pence in the streets. Ninette and I--Ninette with her
5377,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"barrel-organ, and I fiddling. Poor little Ninette--that air was one of"
5378,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"the four her organ played. I wonder what has become of her? Dead, I"
5379,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"should hope, poor child. Now that I am successful and famous, a Baron"
5380,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"of the French Empire, it is not altogether unpleasant to think of the"
5381,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"old, penniless, vagrant days, by a blazing fire in a thick carpeted"
5382,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"room, with the November night shut outside. I am rather an epicure of"
5383,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"my emotions, and my work is none the worse for it."
5384,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5385,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Little egoist,' I remember Lady Greville once said of me, 'he has the"
5386,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,true artistic susceptibility. All his sensations are so much grist for
5387,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,his art.'
5388,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5389,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"But it is of Ninette, not Lady Greville, that I think to-night,"
5390,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Ninette's childish face that the dreary grinding organ brings up
5391,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"before me, not Lady Greville's aquiline nose and delicate artificial"
5392,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,complexion.
5393,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5394,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"Although I am such a great man now, I should find it very awkward to"
5395,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,be obliged to answer questions as to my parentage and infancy.
5396,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5397,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"Even my nationality I could not state precisely, though I know I am as"
5398,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"much Italian as English, perhaps rather more. From Italy I have"
5399,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"inherited my genius and enthusiasm for art, from England I think I"
5400,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"must have got my common-sense, and the capacity of keeping the money"
5401,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"which I make; also a certain natural coldness of disposition, which"
5402,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,those who only know me as a public character do not dream of. All my
5403,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,earliest memories are very vague and indistinct. I remember tramping
5404,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"over France and Italy with a man and woman--they were Italian, I"
5405,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"believe--who beat me, and a fiddle, which I loved passionately, and"
5406,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,which I cannot remember having ever been without. They are very
5407,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"shadowy presences now, and the name of the man I have forgotten. The"
5408,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"woman, I think, was called Maddalena. I am ignorant whether they were"
5409,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"related to me in any way: I know that I hated them bitterly, and"
5410,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"eventually, after a worse beating than usual, ran away from them. I"
5411,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"never cared for any one except my fiddle, until I knew Ninette."
5412,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5413,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,I was very hungry and miserable indeed when that rencontre came about.
5414,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,I wonder sometimes what would have happened if Ninette had not come to
5415,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"the rescue, just at that particular juncture. Would some other"
5416,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"salvation have appeared, or would--well, well, if one once begins"
5417,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,wondering what would have happened if certain accidents in one's life
5418,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"had not befallen one when they did, where will one come to a stop?"
5419,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"Anyhow, when I had escaped from my taskmasters, a wretched, puny child"
5420,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"of ten, undersized and shivering, clasping a cheap fiddle in my arms,"
5421,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"lost in the huge labyrinth of Paris, without a _sou_ in my rags to"
5422,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"save me from starvation, I _did_ meet Ninette, and that, after all, is"
5423,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,the main point.
5424,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5425,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"It was at the close of my first day of independence, a wretched"
5426,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"November evening, very much like this one. I had wandered about all"
5427,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"day, but my efforts had not been rewarded by a single coin. My fiddle"
5428,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"was old and warped, and injured by the rain; its whining was even more"
5429,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"repugnant to my own sensitive ear, than to that of the casual"
5430,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"passer-by. I was in despair. How I hated all the few well-dressed,"
5431,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"well-to-do people who were but on the Boulevards, on that inclement"
5432,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"night. I wandered up and down hoping against hope, until I was too"
5433,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"tired to stand, and then I crawled under the shelter of a covered"
5434,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"passage, and flung myself down on the ground, to die, as I hoped,"
5435,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,crying bitterly.
5436,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5437,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"The alley was dark and narrow, and I did not see at first that it had"
5438,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,another occupant. Presently a hand was put out and touched me on the
5439,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,shoulder.
5440,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5441,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"I started up in terror, though the touch was soft and need not have"
5442,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"alarmed me. I found it came from a little girl, for she was really"
5443,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"about my own age, though then she seemed to me very big and"
5444,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"protecting. But she was tall and strong for her age, and I, as I have"
5445,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"said, was weak and undersized."
5446,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5447,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Chut! little boy,' said Ninette; 'what are you crying for?'"
5448,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5449,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"And I told her my story, as clearly as I could, through my sobs; and"
5450,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"soon a pair of small arms were thrown round my neck, and a smooth"
5451,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,little face laid against my wet one caressingly. I felt as if half my
5452,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,troubles were over.
5453,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5454,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Don't cry, little boy,' said Ninette, grandly; 'I will take care of"
5455,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"you. If you like, you shall live with me. We will make a _ménage_"
5456,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,together. What is your profession?'
5457,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5458,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"I showed her my fiddle, and the sight of its condition caused fresh"
5459,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,tears to flow.
5460,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5461,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Ah!' she said, with a smile of approval, 'a violinist--good! I too am"
5462,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,an artiste. You ask my instrument? There it is!'
5463,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5464,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"And she pointed to an object on the ground beside her, which I had, at"
5465,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"first, taken to be a big box, and dimly hoped might contain eatables."
5466,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,My respect for my new friend suffered a little diminution. Already I
5467,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"felt instinctively that to play the fiddle, even though it is an old,"
5468,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"a poor one, is to be something above a mere organ-grinder."
5469,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5470,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,But I did not express this feeling--was not this little girl going to
5471,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"take me home with her? would not she, doubtless, give me something to"
5472,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,eat?
5473,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5474,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,My first impulse was an artistic one; that was of Italy. The
5475,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,concealment of it was due to the English side of me--the practical
5476,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,side.
5477,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5478,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,I crept close to the little girl; she drew me to her protectingly.
5479,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5480,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'What is thy name, _p'tit_?' she said."
5481,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5482,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Anton,' I answered, for that was what the woman Maddalena had called"
5483,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"me. Her husband, if he was her husband, never gave me any title,"
5484,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"except when he was abusing me, and then my names were many and"
5485,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"unmentionable. Nowadays I am the Baron Antonio Antonelli, of the"
5486,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"Legion of Honour, but that is merely an extension of the old concise"
5487,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"Anton, so far as I know, the only name I ever had.'"
5488,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5489,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Anton?' repeated the little girl, that is a nice name to say. Mine is"
5490,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Ninette.'
5491,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5492,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"We sat in silence in our sheltered nook, waiting until the rain should"
5493,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"stop, and very soon I began to whimper again."
5494,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5495,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'I am so hungry, Ninette,' I said; 'I have eaten nothing to-day.'"
5496,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5497,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,In the literal sense this was a lie; I had eaten some stale crusts in
5498,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"the early morning, before I gave my taskmasters the slip, but the"
5499,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,hunger was true enough.
5500,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5501,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Ninette began to reproach herself for not thinking of this before.
5502,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"After much fumbling in her pocket, she produced a bit of _brioche_, an"
5503,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"apple, and some cold chestnuts."
5504,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5505,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'_V'la_, Anton,' she said, 'pop those in your mouth. When we get home"
5506,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,we will have supper together. I have bread and milk at home. And we
5507,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,will buy two hot potatoes from the man on the _quai_.'
5508,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5509,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"I ate the unsatisfying morsels ravenously, Ninette watching me with an"
5510,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"approving nod the while. When they were finished, the weather was a"
5511,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"little better, and Ninette said we might move. She slung the organ"
5512,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"over her shoulder--it was a small organ, though heavy for a child; but"
5513,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"she was used to it, and trudged along under its weight like a woman."
5514,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,With her free hand she caught hold of me and led me along the wet
5515,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"streets, proudly home. Ninette's home! Poor little Ninette! It was"
5516,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"colder and barer than these rooms of mine now; it had no grand piano,"
5517,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"and no thick carpets; and in the place of pictures and _bibelots_, its"
5518,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,walls were only wreathed in cobwebs. Still it was drier than the
5519,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"streets of Paris, and if it had been a palace it could not have been"
5520,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,more welcome to me than it was that night.
5521,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5522,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,The _ménage_ of Ninette was a strange one! There was a tumbledown
5523,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"deserted house in the Montparnasse district. It stood apart, in an"
5524,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"overgrown weedy garden, and has long ago been pulled down. It was"
5525,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"uninhabited; no one but a Parisian _gamine_ could have lived in it,"
5526,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"and Ninette had long occupied it, unmolested, save by the rats."
5527,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Through the broken palings in the garden she had no difficulty in
5528,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"passing, and as its back door had fallen to pieces, there was nothing"
5529,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,to bar her further entry. In one of the few rooms which had its window
5530,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"intact, right at the top of the house, a mere attic, Ninette had"
5531,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"installed herself and her scanty goods, and henceforward this became"
5532,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,my home also.
5533,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5534,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,It has struck me since as strange that the child's presence should not
5535,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,have been resented by the owner. But I fancy the house had some story
5536,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"connected with it. It was, I believe, the property of an old and"
5537,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"infirm miser, who in his reluctance to part with any of his money in"
5538,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"repairs had overreached himself, and let his property become"
5539,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"valueless. He could not let it, and he would not pull it down. It"
5540,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"remained therefore an eyesore to the neighbourhood, until his death"
5541,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,put it in the possession of a less avaricious successor. The
5542,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"proprietor never came near the place, and with the neighbours it had a"
5543,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"bad repute, and they avoided it as much as possible. It stood, as I"
5544,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"have said, alone, and in its own garden, and Ninette's occupation of"
5545,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"it may have passed unnoticed, while even if any one of the poor people"
5546,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"living around had known of her, it was, after all, nobody's business"
5547,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,to interfere.
5548,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5549,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"When I was last in Paris I went to look for the house, but all traces"
5550,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"of it had vanished, and over the site, so far as I could fix it, a"
5551,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,narrow street of poor houses flourished.
5552,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5553,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Ninette introduced me to her domain with a proud air of ownership. She
5554,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"had a little store of charcoal, with which she proceeded to light a"
5555,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"fire in the grate, and by its fitful light prepared our common"
5556,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"supper--bread and radishes, washed down by a pennyworth of milk, of"
5557,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"which, I have no doubt, I received the lion's share. As a dessert we"
5558,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"munched, with much relish, the steaming potatoes that Ninette had"
5559,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"bought from a stall in the street, and had kept warm in the pocket of"
5560,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,her apron.
5561,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5562,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"And so, as Ninette said, we made a _ménage_ together. How that old"
5563,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,organ brings it all back. My fiddle was useless after the hard usage
5564,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"it received that day. Ninette and I went out on our rounds together,"
5565,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"but for the present I was a sleeping partner in the firm, and all I"
5566,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"could do was to grind occasionally when Ninette's arm ached, or pick"
5567,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"up the sous that were thrown us. Ninette was, as a rule, fairly"
5568,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"successful. Since her mother had died, a year before, leaving her the"
5569,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"organ as her sole legacy, she had lived mainly by that instrument;"
5570,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"although she often increased her income in the evenings, when"
5571,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"organ-grinding was more than ever at a discount, by selling bunches of"
5572,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,violets and other flowers as button-holes.
5573,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5574,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"With her organ she had a regular beat, and a distinct _clientèle_."
5575,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Children playing with their _bonnes_ in the gardens of the Tuileries
5576,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,and the Luxembourg were her most productive patrons. Of course we had
5577,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"bad days as well as good, and in winter it was especially bad; but as"
5578,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,a rule we managed fairly to make both ends meet. Sometimes we carried
5579,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"home as much as five francs as the result of the day's campaign, but"
5580,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"this, of course, was unusual."
5581,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5582,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"Ninette was not precisely a pretty child, but she had a very bright"
5583,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"face, and wonderful gray eyes. When she smiled, which was often, her"
5584,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"face was very attractive, and a good many people were induced to throw"
5585,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,a sou for the smile which they would have assuredly grudged to the
5586,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,music.
5587,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5588,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"Though we were about the same age, the position which it might have"
5589,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,been expected we should occupy was reversed. It was Ninette who petted
5590,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,and protected me--I who clung to her.
5591,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5592,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"I was very fond of Ninette, certainly. I should have died in those"
5593,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"days if it had not been for her, and sometimes I am surprised at the"
5594,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,tenacity of my tenderness for her. As much as I ever cared for
5595,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"anything except my art, I cared for Ninette. But still she was never"
5596,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"the first with me, as I must have been with her. I was often fretful"
5597,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"and discontented, sometimes, I fear, ready to reproach her for not"
5598,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"taking more pains to alleviate our misery, but all the time of our"
5599,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,partnership Ninette never gave me a cross word. There was something
5600,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"maternal about her affection, which withstood all ungratefulness. She"
5601,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"was always ready to console me when I was miserable, and throw her"
5602,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"arms round me and kiss me when I was cold; and many a time, I am sure,"
5603,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"when the day's earnings had been scanty, the little girl must have"
5604,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"gone to sleep hungry, that I might not be stinted in my supper."
5605,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5606,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"One of my grievances, and that the sorest of all, was the loss of my"
5607,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"beloved fiddle. This, for all her goodwill, Ninette was powerless to"
5608,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,allay.
5609,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5610,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Dear Anton,' she said, 'do not mind about it. I earn enough for both"
5611,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"with my organ, and some day we shall save enough to buy thee a new"
5612,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"fiddle. When we are together, and have got food and charcoal, what"
5613,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"does it matter about an old fiddle? Come, eat thy supper, Anton, and I"
5614,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"will light the fire. Never mind, dear Anton.' And she laid her soft"
5615,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,little cheek against mine with a pleading look.
5616,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5617,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Don't,' I cried, pushing her away, 'you can't understand, Ninette;"
5618,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"you can only grind an organ--just four tunes, always the same. But I"
5619,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"loved my fiddle, loved it! loved it!' I cried passionately. 'It could"
5620,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"talk to me, Ninette, and tell me beautiful, new things, always"
5621,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"beautiful, and always new. Oh, Ninette, I shall die if I cannot play!'"
5622,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5623,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"It was always the same cry, and Ninette, if she could not understand,"
5624,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"and was secretly a little jealous, was as distressed as I was; but"
5625,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,what could she do?
5626,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5627,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"Eventually, I got my violin, and it was Ninette who gave it me. The"
5628,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,manner of its acquirement was in this wise.
5629,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5630,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"Ninette would sometimes invest some of her savings in violets, which"
5631,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"she divided with me, and made into nosegays for us to sell in the"
5632,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,streets at night.
5633,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5634,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Theatre doors and frequented placed on the Boulevards were our
5635,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,favorite spots.
5636,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5637,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"One night we had taken up our station outside the Opera, when a"
5638,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"gentleman stopped on his way in, and asked Ninette for a button-hole."
5639,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,He was in evening dress and in a great hurry.
5640,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5641,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,'How much?' he asked shortly.
5642,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5643,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Ten _sous_, M'sieu,' said exorbitant little Ninette, expecting to get"
5644,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,two at the most.
5645,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5646,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,The gentleman drew out some coins hastily and selected a bunch from

5648,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5649,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Here is a franc,' he said, 'I cannot wait for change,' and putting a"
5650,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,coin into Ninette's hand he turned into the theatre.
5651,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5652,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Ninette ran towards me with her eyes gleaming; she held up the piece
5653,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,of money exultantly.
5654,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5655,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Tiens, Anton!' she cried, and I saw that it was not a franc, as we"
5656,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"had though at first, but a gold Napoleon."
5657,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5658,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,I believe the good little boy and girl in the story-books would have
5659,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,immediately sought out the unfortunate gentleman and bid him rectify
5660,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"his mistake, generally receiving, so the legend runs, a far larger"
5661,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,bonus as a reward of their integrity. I have never been a particularly
5662,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"good little boy, however, and I don't think it ever struck either"
5663,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Ninette or myself--perhaps we were not sufficiently speculative--that
5664,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,any other course was open to us than to profit by the mistake. Ninette
5665,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,began to consider how we were to spend it.
5666,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5667,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'Think of it, Anton, a whole gold _louis_. A _louis_,' said Ninette,"
5668,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"counting laboriously, 'is twenty francs, a franc is twenty sous,"
5669,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,Anton; how many sous are there in a louis? More than an hundred?'
5670,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5671,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,But this piece of arithmetic was beyond me; I shook my head dubiously.
5672,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,
5673,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'What shall we buy first, Anton?' said Ninette, with sparkling eyes."
5674,SOUVENIRS OF AN EGOIST,"'You shall have new things, Anton, a pair of new shoes and an hat; and"
5675,I--',I--'
5676,I--',
5677,I--',But I had other things than clothes in my mind's eye; I interrupted
5678,I--',her.
5679,I--',
5680,I--',"'Ninette, dear little Ninette,' I said coaxingly, 'remember the"
5681,I--',fiddle.'
5682,I--',
5683,I--',"Ninette's face fell, but she was a tender little thing, and she showed"
5684,I--',no hesitation.
5685,I--',
5686,I--',"'Certainly, Anton,' she said, but with less enthusiasm, 'we will get"
5687,I--',it to-morrow--one of the fiddles you showed me in M. Boudinot's shop
5688,I--',"on the Quai. Do you think the ten-franc one will do, or the light one"
5689,I--',for fifteen francs?'
5690,I--',
5691,I--',"'Oh, the light one, dear Ninette,' I said; 'it is worth more than the"
5692,I--',"extra money. Besides, we shall soon earn it back now. Why if you could"
5693,I--',"earn such a lot as you have with your old organ, when you only have to"
5694,I--',"turn an handle, think what a lot I shall make, fiddling. For you have"
5695,I--',"to be something to play the fiddle, Ninette.'"
5696,I--',
5697,I--',"'Yes,' said the little girl, wincing; 'you are right, dear Anton."
5698,I--',Perhaps you will get rich and go away and leave me?'
5699,I--',
5700,I--',"'No, Ninette,' I declared grandly, 'I will always take care of you. I"
5701,I--',"have no doubt I shall get rich, because I am going to be a great"
5702,I--',"musician, but I shall not leave you. I will have a big house on the"
5703,I--',"Champs Elysées, and then you shall come and live with me, and be my"
5704,I--',"housekeeper. And in the evenings, I will play to you and make you open"
5705,I--',"your eyes, Ninette. You will like me to play, you know; we are often"
5706,I--',dull in the evenings.'
5707,I--',
5708,I--',"'Yes,' said Ninette meekly, 'we will buy your fiddle to-morrow, dear"
5709,I--',Anton. Let us go home now.'
5710,I--',
5711,I--',Poor vanished Ninette! I must often have made the little heart sore
5712,I--',"with some of the careless things I said. Yet looking back at it now, I"
5713,I--',know that I never cared for any living person so much as I did for
5714,I--',Ninette.
5715,I--',
5716,I--',"I have very few illusions left now; a childhood, such as mine, does"
5717,I--',"not tend to preserve them, and time and success have not made me less"
5718,I--',cynical. Still I have never let my scepticism touch that childish
5719,I--',"presence. Lady Greville once said to me, in the presence of her nephew"
5720,I--',"Felix Leominster, a musician too, like myself, that we three were"
5721,I--',"curiously suited, for that we were, without exception, the three most"
5722,I--',"cynical persons in the universe, Perhaps in a way she was right. Yet"
5723,I--',for all her cynicism Lady Greville I know has a bundle of old and
5724,I--',"faded letters, tied up in black ribbon in some hidden drawer, that"
5725,I--',"perhaps she never reads now, but that she cannot forget or destroy."
5726,I--',"They are in a bold handwriting, that is, not, I think, that of the"
5727,I--',"miserable, old debauchee, her husband, from whom she has been"
5728,I--',"separated since the first year of her marriage, and their envelopes"
5729,I--',bear Indian postmarks.
5730,I--',
5731,I--',"And Felix, who told me the history of those letters with a smile of"
5732,I--',"pity on his thin, ironical lips--Felix, whose principles are adapted"
5733,I--',"to his conscience and whose conscience is bounded by the law, and in"
5734,I--',"whom I believe as little as he does in me, I found out by accident not"
5735,I--',"so very long ago. It was on the day of All Souls, the melancholy"
5736,I--',"festival of souvenirs, celebrated once a year, under the November"
5737,I--',"fogs, that I strayed into the Montparnasse Cemetery, to seek"
5738,I--',"inspiration for my art. And though he did not see me, I saw Felix, the"
5739,I--',"prince of railers, who believes in nothing and cares for nothing"
5740,I--',"except himself, for music is not with him a passion but an _agrément_."
5741,I--',"Felix bareheaded, and without his usual smile, putting fresh flowers"
5742,I--',"on the grave of a little Parisian grisette, who had been his mistress"
5743,I--',and died five years ago. I thought of Balzac's 'Messe de l'Athée' and
5744,I--',"ranked Felix's inconsistency with it, feeling at the same time how"
5745,I--',"natural such a paradox is. And myself, the last of the trio, at the"
5746,I--',"mercy of a street organ, I cannot forget Ninette."
5747,I--',
5748,I--',Though it was not until many years had passed that I heard that little
5749,I--',"criticism, the purchase of my fiddle was destined very shortly to"
5750,I--',bring my life in contact with its author. Those were the days when a
5751,I--',"certain restraint grew up between Ninette and myself. Ninette, it must"
5752,I--',"be confessed, was jealous of the fiddle. Perhaps she knew"
5753,I--',"instinctively that music was with me a single and absorbing passion,"
5754,I--',"from which she was excluded. She was no genius, little Ninette, and"
5755,I--',her organ was nothing more to her than the means of making a
5756,I--',"livelihood; she felt not the smallest _tendresse_ for it, and could"
5757,I--',"not understand why a dead and inanimate fiddle, made of mere wood and"
5758,I--',"catgut, should be any more to me than that. How could she know that to"
5759,I--',"me it was never a dead thing, that even when it hung hopelessly out of"
5760,I--',"my reach, in the window of M. Boudinot, before ever it had given out"
5761,I--',"wild, impassioned music beneath my hands, it was always a live thing"
5762,I--',"to me, alive and with a human, throbbing heart, vibrating with hope"
5763,I--',and passion.
5764,I--',
5765,I--',"So Ninette was jealous of the fiddle, and being proud in her way, she"
5766,I--',"became more and more quiet and reticent, and drew herself aloof from"
5767,I--',"me, although, wrapped up as I was in the double egoism of art and"
5768,I--',"boyhood, I failed to notice this. I have been sorry since that any"
5769,I--',shadow of misunderstanding should have clouded the closing days of our
5770,I--',"partnership. It is late to regret now, however. When my fiddle was"
5771,I--',"added to our belongings, we took to going out separately. It was more"
5772,I--',"profitable, and, besides, Ninette, I think, saw that I was growing a"
5773,I--',"little ashamed of her organ. On one of these occasions, as I played"
5774,I--',"before a house in the Faubourg St. Germain, the turning point of my"
5775,I--',"life befell me. The house, outside which I had taken my station was a"
5776,I--',"large, white one, with a balcony on the first floor. This balcony was"
5777,I--',"unoccupied, but the window looking to it was open, and through the"
5778,I--',lace curtains I could distinguish the sound of voices. I began to
5779,I--',"play; at first, one of the airs that Maddalena had taught me; but"
5780,I--',"before it was finished, I had glided off, as usual, into an"
5781,I--',improvisation.
5782,I--',
5783,I--',"When I was playing like that, I threw all my soul into my fingers, and"
5784,I--',I had neither ears nor eyes for anything round me. I did not therefore
5785,I--',notice until I had finished playing that a lady and a young man had
5786,I--',"come out into the balcony, and were beckoning to me."
5787,I--',
5788,I--',"'Bravo!' cried the lady enthusiastically, but she did not throw me the"
5789,I--',"reward I had expected. She turned and said something to her companion,"
5790,I--',"who smiled and disappeared. I waited expectantly, thinking perhaps she"
5791,I--',"had sent him for her purse. Presently the door opened, and the young"
5792,I--',man issued from it. He came to me and touched me on the shoulder.
5793,I--',
5794,I--',"'You are to come with me,' he said, authoritatively, speaking in"
5795,I--',"French, but with an English accent. I followed him, my heart beating"
5796,I--',"with excitement, through the big door, into a large, handsome hall and"
5797,I--',"up a broad staircase, thinking that in all my life I had never seen"
5798,I--',such a beautiful house.
5799,I--',
5800,I--',"He led me into a large and luxurious _salon_, which seemed to my"
5801,I--',astonished eyes like a wonderful museum. The walls were crowded with
5802,I--',"pictures, a charming composition by Gustave Moreau was lying on the"
5803,I--',"grand piano, waiting until a nook could be found for it to hang."
5804,I--',Renaissance bronzes and the work of eighteenth century silversmiths
5805,I--',"jostled one another on brackets, and on a table lay a handsome"
5806,I--',"violin-case. The pale blinds were drawn down, and there was a"
5807,I--',delicious smell of flowers diffused everywhere. A lady was lying on a
5808,I--',"sofa near the window, a handsome woman of about thirty, whose dress"
5809,I--',was a miracle of lace and flimsiness.
5810,I--',
5811,I--',"The young man led me towards her, and she placed two delicate,"
5812,I--',"jewelled hands on my shoulders, looking me steadily in the face."
5813,I--',
5814,I--',"'Where did you learn to play like that, my boy?' she asked."
5815,I--',
5816,I--',"'I cannot remember when I could not fiddle, Madame,' I answered, and"
5817,I--',that was true.
5818,I--',
5819,I--',"'The boy is a born musician, Felix,' said Lady Greville. 'Look at his"
5820,I--',hands.'
5821,I--',
5822,I--',And she held up mine to the young man's notice; he glanced at them
5823,I--',carelessly.
5824,I--',
5825,I--',"'Yes, Miladi,' said the young man, 'they are real violin hands. What"
5826,I--',"were you playing just now, my lad?'"
5827,I--',
5828,I--',"'I don't know, sir,' I said. 'I play just what comes into my head.'"
5829,I--',
5830,I--',Lady Greville looked at her nephew with a glance of triumph.
5831,I--',
5832,I--',"'What did I tell you?' she cried. 'The boy is a genius, Felix. I shall"
5833,I--',have him educated.'
5834,I--',
5835,I--',"'All your geese are swans, Auntie,' said the young man in English."
5836,I--',
5837,I--',"Lady Greville, however, ignored this thrust."
5838,I--',
5839,I--',"'Will you play for me now, my dear,' she said, 'as you did"
5840,I--',before--just what comes into your head?'
5841,I--',
5842,I--',"I nodded, and was getting my fiddle to my chin, when she stopped me."
5843,I--',
5844,I--',"'Not that thing,' bestowing a glance of contempt at my instrument."
5845,I--',"'Felix, the Stradivarius.'"
5846,I--',
5847,I--',"The young man went to the other side of the room, and returned with"
5848,I--',"the case which I had noticed. He put it in my hand, with the"
5849,I--',"injunction to handle it gently. I had never heard of Cremona violins,"
5850,I--',nor of my namesake Stradivarius; but at the sight of the dark seasoned
5851,I--',"wood, reposing on its blue velvet, I could not restrain a cry of"
5852,I--',admiration.
5853,I--',
5854,I--',"I have that same instrument in my room now, and I would not trust it"
5855,I--',in the hands of another for a million.
5856,I--',
5857,I--',"I lifted the violin tenderly from its case, and ran my bow up the"
5858,I--',gamut.
5859,I--',
5860,I--',I felt almost intoxicated at the mellow sounds it uttered. I could
5861,I--',"have kissed the dark wood, that looked to me stained through and"
5862,I--',through with melody.
5863,I--',
5864,I--',I began to play. My improvisation was a song of triumph and delight;
5865,I--',"the music, at first rapid and joyous, became slower and more solemn,"
5866,I--',"as the inspiration seized on me, until at last, in spite of myself, it"
5867,I--',"grew into a wild and indescribable dirge, fading away in a long wail"
5868,I--',of unutterable sadness and regret. When it was over I felt exhausted
5869,I--',"and unstrung, as though virtue had gone out from me. I had played as I"
5870,I--',"had never played before. The young man had turned away, and was"
5871,I--',looking out of the window. The lady on the sofa was transfigured. The
5872,I--',"languor had altogether left her, and the tears were streaming down her"
5873,I--',"face, to the great detriment of the powder and enamel which composed"
5874,I--',her complexion.
5875,I--',
5876,I--',"She pulled me towards her, and kissed me."
5877,I--',
5878,I--',"'It is beautiful, terrible!' she said; 'I have never heard such"
5879,I--',strange music in my life. You must stay with me now and have masters.
5880,I--',"If you can play like that now, without culture and education, in time,"
5881,I--',"when you have been taught, you will be the greatest violinist that"
5882,I--',ever lived.'
5883,I--',
5884,I--',"I will say of Lady Greville that, in spite of her frivolity and"
5885,I--',"affectations, she does love music at the bottom of her soul, with the"
5886,I--',absorbing passion that in my eyes would absolve a person for
5887,I--',committing all the sins in the Decalogue. If her heart could be taken
5888,I--',"out and examined I can fancy it as a shield, divided into equal"
5889,I--',"fields. Perhaps, as her friends declare, one of these might bear the"
5890,I--',device 'Modes et Confections'; but I am sure that you would see on the
5891,I--',"other, even more deeply graven, the divine word 'Music.'"
5892,I--',
5893,I--',She is one of the few persons whose praise of any of my compositions
5894,I--',"gives me real satisfaction; and almost alone, when everybody is"
5895,I--',"running, in true goose fashion, to hear my piano recitals, she knows"
5896,I--',and tells me to stick to my true vocation--the violin.
5897,I--',
5898,I--',"'My dear Baron,' she said, 'why waste your time playing on an"
5899,I--',"instrument which is not suited to you, when you have Stradivarius"
5900,I--',waiting at home for the magic touch?'
5901,I--',
5902,I--',"She was right, though it is the fashion to speak of me now as a second"
5903,I--',"Rubenstein. There are two or three finer pianists than I, even here in"
5904,I--',"England. But I am quite sure, yes, and you are sure, too, oh my"
5905,I--',"Stradivarius, that in the whole world there is nobody who can make"
5906,I--',"such music out of you as I can, no one to whom you tell such stories"
5907,I--',"as you tell to me. Any one, who knows, could see by merely looking at"
5908,I--',my hands that they are violin and not piano hands.
5909,I--',
5910,I--',"'Will you come and live with me, Anton?' said Lady Greville, more"
5911,I--',"calmly. 'I am rich, and childless; you shall live just as if you were"
5912,I--',my child. The best masters in Europe shall teach you. Tell me where to
5913,I--',"find your parents, Anton, and I will see them to-night.'"
5914,I--',
5915,I--',"'I have no parents,' I said, 'only Ninette. I cannot leave Ninette.'"
5916,I--',
5917,I--',"'Shade of Musset, who is Ninette?' asked Felix, turning round from the"
5918,I--',window.
5919,I--',
5920,I--',I told him.
5921,I--',
5922,I--','What is to be done?' cried Lady Greville in perplexity. 'I cannot
5923,I--',"have the girl here as well, and I will not let my Phoenix go.'"
5924,I--',
5925,I--',"'Send her to the Sœurs de la Misericorde,' said the young man"
5926,I--',carelessly; 'you have a nomination.'
5927,I--',
5928,I--',"'Have I?' said Lady Greville, with a laugh. 'I am sure I did not know"
5929,I--',it. It is an excellent idea; but do you think he will come without the
5930,I--',other? I suppose they were like brother and sister?'
5931,I--',
5932,I--',"'Look at him now,' said Felix, pointing to where I stood caressing the"
5933,I--',precious wood; 'he would sell his soul for that fiddle.'
5934,I--',
5935,I--',"Lady Greville took the hint. 'Here, Anton,' said she, 'I cannot have"
5936,I--',"Ninette here--you understand, once and for all. But I will see that"
5937,I--',"she is sent to a kind home, where she will want for nothing and be"
5938,I--',trained up as a servant. You need not bother about her. You will live
5939,I--',"with me and be taught, and some day, if you are good and behave, you"
5940,I--',shall go and see Ninette.'
5941,I--',
5942,I--',"I was irresolute, but I only said doggedly, feeling what would be the"
5943,I--',"end, 'I do not want to come, if Ninette may not.'"
5944,I--',
5945,I--',Then Lady Greville played her trump card.
5946,I--',
5947,I--',"'Look, Anton,' she said, 'you see that violin. I have no need, I see,"
5948,I--',"to tell you its value. If you will come with me and make no scene, you"
5949,I--',shall have it for your very own. Ninette will be perfectly happy. Do
5950,I--',you agree?'
5951,I--',
5952,I--',"I looked at my old fiddle, lying on the floor. How yellow and trashy"
5953,I--',"it looked beside the grand old Cremona, bedded in its blue velvet."
5954,I--',
5955,I--',"'I will do what you like, Madame,' I said."
5956,I--',
5957,I--',"'Human nature is pretty much the same in geniuses and dullards,' said"
5958,I--',"Felix. 'I congratulate you, Auntie.'"
5959,I--',
5960,I--',"And so the bargain was struck, and the new life entered upon that very"
5961,I--',"day. Lady Greville sought out Ninette at once, though I was not"
5962,I--',allowed to accompany her.
5963,I--',
5964,I--',I never saw Ninette again. She made no opposition to Lady Greville's
5965,I--',"scheme. She let herself be taken to the Orphanage, and she never"
5966,I--',"asked, so they said, to see me again."
5967,I--',
5968,I--',"'She's a stupid little thing,' said Lady Greville to her nephew, on"
5969,I--',"her return, 'and as plain as possible; but I suppose she was kind to"
5970,I--',the boy. They will forget each other now I hope. It is not as if they
5971,I--',were related.'
5972,I--',
5973,I--',"'In that case they would already be hating each other. However, I am"
5974,I--',"quite sure your protégé will forget soon enough; and, after all, you"
5975,I--',have nothing to do with the girl.'
5976,I--',
5977,I--',I suppose I did not think very much of Ninette then; but what would
5978,I--',"you have? It was such a change from the old vagrant days, that there"
5979,I--',is a good deal to excuse me. I was absorbed too in the new and
5980,I--',"wonderful symmetry which music began to assume, as taught me by the"
5981,I--',"master Lady Greville procured for me. When the news was broken to me,"
5982,I--',"with great gentleness, that my little companion had run away from the"
5983,I--',"sisters with whom she had been placed--run away, and left no traces"
5984,I--',"behind her, I hardly realised how completely she would have passed"
5985,I--',away from me. I thought of her for a little while with some regret;
5986,I--',"then I remembered Stradivarius, and I could not be sorry long. So by"
5987,I--',degrees I ceased to think of her.
5988,I--',
5989,I--',"I lived on in Lady Greville's house, going with her, wherever she"
5990,I--',"stayed--London, Paris, and Nice--until I was thirteen. Then she sent"
5991,I--',"me away to study music at a small German capital, in the house of one"
5992,I--',of the few surviving pupils of Weber. We parted as we had lived
5993,I--',"together, without affection."
5994,I--',
5995,I--',"Personally Lady Greville did not like me; if anything, she felt an"
5996,I--',actual repugnance towards me. All the care she lavished on me was for
5997,I--',"the sake of my talent, not for myself. She took a great deal of"
5998,I--',"trouble in superintending, not only my musical education, but my"
5999,I--',"general culture. She designed little mediæval costumes for me, and was"
6000,I--',indefatigable in her endeavours to impart to my manners that finish
6001,I--',which a gutter education had denied me.
6002,I--',
6003,I--',"There is a charming portrait of me, by a well-known English artist,"
6004,I--',"that hangs now in her ladyship's drawing-room. A pale boy of twelve,"
6005,I--',"clad in an old-fashioned suit of ruby velvet; a boy with huge, black"
6006,I--',"eyes, and long curls of the same colour, is standing by an oak"
6007,I--',"music-stand, holding before him a Cremona violin, whose rich colouring"
6008,I--',is relieved admirably by the beautiful old point lace with which the
6009,I--',boy's doublet is slashed. It is a charming picture. The famous artist
6010,I--',"who painted it considers it his best portrait, and Lady Greville is"
6011,I--',proud of it.
6012,I--',
6013,I--',But her pride is of the same quality as that which made her value my
6014,I--',presence. I was in her eyes merely the complement of her famous
6015,I--',fiddle.
6016,I--',
6017,I--',I heard her one day express a certain feeling of relief at my
6018,I--',approaching departure.
6019,I--',
6020,I--','You regret having taken him up?' asked her nephew curiously.
6021,I--',
6022,I--',"'No,' she said, 'that would be folly. He repays all one's trouble, as"
6023,I--',soon as he touches his fiddle--but I don't like him.'
6024,I--',
6025,I--',"'He can play like the great Pan,' says Felix."
6026,I--',
6027,I--',"'Yes, and like Pan he is half a beast.'"
6028,I--',
6029,I--',"'You may make a musician out of him,' answered the young man,"
6030,I--',"examining his pink nails with a certain admiration, 'but you will"
6031,I--',never make him a gentleman.'
6032,I--',
6033,I--',"'Perhaps not,' said Lady Greville carelessly. 'Still, Felix, he is"
6034,I--',very refined.'
6035,I--',
6036,I--',_Dame!_ I think he would own himself mistaken now. Mr. Felix
6037,I--',Leominster himself is not a greater social success than the Baron
6038,I--',"Antonio Antonelli, of the Legion of Honour. I am as sensitive as any"
6039,I--',"one to the smallest spot on my linen, and Duchesses rave about my"
6040,I--',charming manners.
6041,I--',
6042,I--',For the rest my souvenirs are not very numerous. I lived in Germany
6043,I--',"until I made my _début_, and I never heard anything more of Ninette."
6044,I--',
6045,I--',The history of my life is very much the history of my art: and that
6046,I--',you know. I have always been an art-concentrated
6047,I--',"man--self-concentrated, my friend Felix Leominster tells me"
6048,I--',frankly--and since I was a boy nothing has ever troubled the serene
6049,I--',repose of my egoism.
6050,I--',
6051,I--',It is strange considering the way people rant about the 'passionate
6052,I--',"sympathy' of my playing, the 'enormous potentiality of suffering'"
6053,I--',"revealed in my music, how singularly free from passion and disturbance"
6054,I--',my life has been.
6055,I--',
6056,I--',I have never let myself be troubled by what is commonly called 'love.'
6057,I--',"To be frank with you, I do not much believe in it. Of the two"
6058,I--',"principal elements of which it is composed, vanity and egoism, I have"
6059,I--',"too little of the former, too much of the latter, too much coldness"
6060,I--',withal in my character to suffer from it. My life has been notoriously
6061,I--',irreproachable. I figure in polemical literature as an instance of a
6062,I--',man who has lived in contact with the demoralising influence of the
6063,I--',"stage, and will yet go to Heaven. _A la bonne heure!_"
6064,I--',
6065,I--',I am coming to the end of my souvenirs and of my cigar at the same
6066,I--',"time. I must convey a coin somehow to that dreary person outside, who"
6067,I--',is grinding now half-way down the street.
6068,I--',
6069,I--',"On consideration, I decide emphatically against opening the window and"
6070,I--',"presenting it that way. If the fog once gets in, it will utterly spoil"
6071,I--',me for any work this evening. I feel myself in travail also of two
6072,I--',charming little _Lieder_ that all this thinking about Ninette has
6073,I--',suggested. How would 'Chansons de Gamine' do for a title? I think it
6074,I--',"best, on second thoughts, to ring for Giacomo, my man, and send him"
6075,I--',out with the half-crown I propose to sacrifice on the altar of
6076,I--',"sentiment. Doubtless the musician is a country-woman of his, and if he"
6077,I--',"pockets the coin, that is his look out."
6078,I--',
6079,I--',"Now if I was writing a romance, what a chance I have got. I should"
6080,I--',tell you how my organ-grinder turned out to be no other than Ninette.
6081,I--',Of course she would not be spoilt or changed by the years--just the
6082,I--',same Ninette. Then what scope for a pathetic scene of reconciliation
6083,I--',"and forgiveness--the whole to conclude with a peal of marriage bells,"
6084,I--',two people living together 'happy ever after.' But I am not writing a
6085,I--',"romance, and I am a musician, not a poet."
6086,I--',
6087,I--',"Sometimes, however, it strikes me that I should like to see Ninette"
6088,I--',"again, and I find myself seeking traces of her in childish faces in"
6089,I--',the street.
6090,I--',
6091,I--',The absurdity of such an expectation strikes me very forcibly
6092,I--',"afterwards, when I look at my reflection in the glass, and tell myself"
6093,I--',that I must be careful in the disposition of my parting.
6094,I--',
6095,I--',"Ninette, too, was my contemporary. Still I cannot conceive of her as a"
6096,I--',"woman. To me she is always a child. Ninette grown up, with a draggled"
6097,I--',"dress and squalling babies, is an incongruous thing that shocks my"
6098,I--',"sense of artistic fitness. My fiddle is my only mistress, and while I"
6099,I--',"can summon its consolation at command, I may not be troubled by the"
6100,I--',pettiness of a merely human love. But once when I was down with Roman
6101,I--',"fever, and tossed on a hotel bed, all the long, hot night, while"
6102,I--',"Giacomo drowsed in a corner over 'Il Diavolo Rosa,' I seemed to miss"
6103,I--',Ninette.
6104,I--',
6105,I--',"Remembering that time, I sometimes fancy that when the inevitable hour"
6106,I--',"strikes, and this hand is too weak to raise the soul of melody out of"
6107,I--',"Stradivarius--when, my brief dream of life and music over, I go down"
6108,I--',"into the dark land, where there is no more music, and no Ninette, into"
6109,I--',"the sleep from which there comes no awaking, I should like to see her"
6110,I--',"again, not the woman but the child. I should like to look into the"
6111,I--',"wonderful eyes of the old Ninette, to feel the soft cheek laid against"
6112,I--',"mine, to hold the little brown hands, as in the old _gamin_ days."
6113,I--',
6114,I--',"It is a foolish thought, because I am not forty yet, and with the"
6115,I--',moderate life I lead I may live to play Stradivarius for another
6116,I--',thirty years.
6117,I--',
6118,I--',"There is always the hope, too, that it, when it comes, may seize me"
6119,I--',"suddenly. To see it coming, that is the horrible part. I should like"
6120,I--',"to be struck by lightning, with you in my arms, Stradivarius, oh, my"
6121,I--',beloved--to die playing.
6122,I--',
6123,I--',The literary gentleman over my head is stamping viciously about his
6124,I--',room. What would his language be if he knew how I have rewarded his
6125,I--',tormentress--he whose principles are so strict that he would bear the
6126,I--',"agony for hours, sooner than give a barrel-organ sixpence to go to"
6127,I--',another street. He would be capable of giving Giacomo a sovereign to
6128,I--',"pocket my coin, if he only knew. Yet I owe that unmusical old organ a"
6129,I--',"charming evening, tinged with the faint _soupçon_ of melancholy which"
6130,I--',is necessary to and enhances the highest pleasure. Over the memories
6131,I--',it has excited I have smoked a pleasant cigar--peace to its ashes!

6137,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6138,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6139,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"During five years of an almost daily association with Michael Garth,"
6140,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"in a solitude of Chili, which threw us, men of common speech, though"
6141,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"scarcely of common interests, largely on each other's tolerance, I had"
6142,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"grown, if not into an intimacy with him, at least into a certain"
6143,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"familiarity, through which the salient feature of his history, his"
6144,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"character reached me. It was a singular character, and an history rich"
6145,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"in instruction. So much I gathered from hints, which he let drop long"
6146,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"before I had heard the end of it. Unsympathetic as the man was to me,"
6147,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,it was impossible not to be interested by it. As our acquaintance
6148,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"advanced, it took (his character I mean) more and more the aspect of a"
6149,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"difficult problem in psychology, that I was passionately interested in"
6150,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"solving: to study it was my recreation, after watching the fluctuating"
6151,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"course of nitrates. So that when I had achieved fortune, and might"
6152,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"have started home immediately, my interest induced me to wait more"
6153,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"than three months, and return in the same ship with him. It was"
6154,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,through this delay that I am enabled to transcribe the issue of my
6155,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"impressions: I found them edifying, if only for their singular irony."
6156,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6157,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,From his own mouth indeed I gleaned but little; although during our
6158,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"voyage home, in those long nights when we paced the deck together"
6159,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"under the Southern Cross, his reticence occasionally gave way, and I"
6160,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,obtained glimpses of a more intimate knowledge of him than the whole
6161,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,of our juxtaposition on the station had ever afforded me. I guessed
6162,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"more, however, than he told me; and what was lacking I pieced together"
6163,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"later, from the talk of the girl to whom I broke the news of his"
6164,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"death. He named her to me, for the first time, a day or two before"
6165,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"that happened: a piece of confidence so unprecedented, that I must"
6166,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"have been blind, indeed, not to have foreseen what it prefaced. I had"
6167,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"seen her face the first time I entered his house, where her photograph"
6168,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"hung on a conspicuous wall: the charming, oval face of a young girl,"
6169,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"little more than a child, with great eyes, that one guessed, one knew"
6170,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"not why, to be the colour of violets, looking out with singular"
6171,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"wistfulness from a waving cloud of dark hair. Afterwards, he told me"
6172,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"that it was the picture of his _fiancée_: but, before that, signs had"
6173,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,not been wanting by which I had read a woman in his life.
6174,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6175,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,Iquique is not Paris; it is not even Valparaiso; but it is a city of
6176,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"civilisation; and but two days' ride from the pestilential stew, where"
6177,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"we nursed our lives doggedly on quinine and hope, the ultimate hope of"
6178,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"evasion. The lives of most Englishmen yonder, who superintend works in"
6179,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"the interior, are held on the same tenure: you know them by a certain"
6180,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"savage, hungry look in their eyes. In the meantime, while they wait"
6181,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"for their luck, most of them are glad enough when business calls them"
6182,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"down for a day or two to Iquique. There are shops and streets, lit"
6183,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,streets through which blackeyed Senoritas pass in their lace mantilas;
6184,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,there are _cafés_ too; and faro for those who reck of it; and bull
6185,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"fights, and newspapers younger than six weeks; and in the harbour,"
6186,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"taking in their fill of nitrates, many ships, not to be considered"
6187,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"without envy, because they are coming, within a limit of days to"
6188,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"England. But Iquique had no charm for Michael Garth, and when one of"
6189,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"us must go, it was usually I, his subordinate, who being delegated,"
6190,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,congratulated myself on his indifference. Hard-earned dollars melted
6191,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"at Iquique; and to Garth, life in Chili had long been solely a matter"
6192,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"of amassing them. So he stayed on, in the prickly heat of Agnas"
6193,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"Blancas, and grimly counted the days, and the money (although his"
6194,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"nature, I believe, was fundamentally generous, in his set"
6195,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"concentration of purpose, he had grown morbidly avaricious) which"
6196,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"should restore him to his beautiful mistress. Morose, reticent,"
6197,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"unsociable as he had become, he had still, I discovered by degrees, a"
6198,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"leaning towards the humanities, a nice taste, such as could only be"
6199,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"the result of much knowledge, in the fine things of literature. His"
6200,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"infinitesimal library, a few French novels, an Horace, and some well"
6201,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,thumbed volumes of the modern English poets in the familiar edition of
6202,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"Tauchnitz, he put at my disposal, in return for a collection, somewhat"
6203,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"similar, although a little larger, of my own. In his rare moments of"
6204,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"amiability, he could talk on such matters with _verve_ and"
6205,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,originality: more usually he preferred to pursue with the bitterest
6206,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"animosity an abstract fetish which he called his ""luck."" He was by"
6207,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"temperament an enraged pessimist; and I could believe, that he"
6208,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"seriously attributed to Providence, some quality inconceivably"
6209,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"malignant, directed in all things personally against himself. His"
6210,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"immense bitterness and his careful avarice, alike, I could explain,"
6211,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"and in a measure justify, when I came to understand that he had felt"
6212,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"the sharpest stings of poverty, and, moreover, was passionately in"
6213,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"love, in love _comme on ne l'est plus_. As to what his previous"
6214,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"resources had been, I knew nothing, nor why they had failed him; but I"
6215,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"gathered that the crisis had come, just when his life was complicated"
6216,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"by the sudden blossoming of an old friendship into love, in his case,"
6217,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"at least, to be complete and final. The girl too was poor; they were"
6218,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"poorer than most poor persons: how could he refuse the post, which,"
6219,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"through the good offices of a friend, was just then unexpectedly"
6220,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"offered him? Certainly, it was abroad; it implied five years' solitude"
6221,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,in Equatorial America. Separation and change were to be accounted;
6222,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"perhaps, diseases and death, and certainly his 'luck,' which seemed to"
6223,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"include all these. But it also promised, when the term of his exile"
6224,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"was up, and there were means of shortening it, a certain competence,"
6225,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"and very likely wealth; escaping those other contingencies, marriage."
6226,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,There seemed no other way. The girl was very young: there was no
6227,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,question of an early marriage; there was not even a definite
6228,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"engagement. Garth would take no promise from her: only for himself, he"
6229,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,was her bound lover while he breathed; would keep himself free to
6230,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"claim her, when he came back in five years, or ten, or twenty, if she"
6231,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,had not chosen better. He would not bind her; but I can imagine how
6232,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"impressive his dark, bitter face must have made this renunciation to"
6233,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,the little girl with the violet eyes; how tenderly she repudiated her
6234,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"freedom. She went out as a governess, and sat down to wait. And"
6235,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,absence only rivetted faster the chain of her affection: it set Garth
6236,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,more securely on the pedestal of her idea; for in love it is most
6237,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"usually the reverse of that social maxim, _les absents ont toujours"
6238,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"tort_, which is true."
6239,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6240,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"Garth, on his side, writing to her, month by month, while her picture"
6241,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"smiled on him from the wall, if he was careful always to insist on her"
6242,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"perfect freedom, added, in effect, so much more than this, that the"
6243,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,renunciation lost its benefit. He lived in a dream of her; and the
6244,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"memory of her eyes and her hair was a perpetual presence with him,"
6245,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,less ghostly than the real company among whom he mechanically
6246,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,transacted his daily business. Burnt away and consumed by desire of
6247,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"her living arms, he was counting the hours which still prevented him"
6248,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"from them. Yet, when his five years were done, he delayed his return,"
6249,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,although his economies had justified it; settled down for another term
6250,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"of five years, which was to be prolonged to seven. Actually, the"
6251,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"memory of his old poverty, with its attendant dishonours, was grown a"
6252,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"fury, pursuing him ceaselessly with whips. The lust of gain, always"
6253,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"for the girl's sake, and so, as it were, sanctified, had become a"
6254,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"second nature to him; an intimate madness, which left him no peace."
6255,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"His worst nightmare was to wake with a sudden shock, imagining that he"
6256,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"had lost everything, that he was reduced to his former poverty: a cold"
6257,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,sweat would break all over him before he had mastered the horror. The
6258,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"recurrence of it, time after time, made him vow grimly, that he would"
6259,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"go home a rich man, rich enough to laugh at the fantasies of his luck."
6260,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"Latterly, indeed, this seemed to have changed; so that his vow was"
6261,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,fortunately kept. He made money lavishly at last: all his operations
6262,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"were successful, even those which seemed the wildest gambling: and the"
6263,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"most forlorn speculations turned round, and shewed a pretty harvest,"
6264,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,when Garth meddled with their stock.
6265,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6266,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"And all the time he was waiting there, and scheming, at Agnas Blancas,"
6267,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,in a feverish concentration of himself upon his ultimate reunion with
6268,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"the girl at home, the man was growing old: gradually at first, and"
6269,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"insensibly; but towards the end, by leaps and starts, with an"
6270,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"increasing consciousness of how he aged and altered, which did but"
6271,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"feed his black melancholy. It was borne upon him, perhaps, a little"
6272,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"brutally, and not by direct self-examination, when there came another"
6273,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"photograph from England. A beautiful face still, but certainly the"
6274,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"face of a woman, who had passed from the grace of girlhood (seven"
6275,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"years now separated her from it), to a dignity touched with sadness: a"
6276,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"face, upon which life had already written some of its cruelties. For"
6277,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"many days after this arrival, Garth was silent and moody, even beyond"
6278,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,his wont: then he studiously concealed it. He threw himself again
6279,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,furiously into his economic battle; he had gone back to the
6280,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"inspiration of that other, older portrait: the charming, oval face of"
6281,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"a young girl, almost a child, with great eyes, that one guessed one"
6282,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"knew not why, to be the colour of violets."
6283,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6284,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"As the time of our departure approached, a week or two before we had"
6285,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"gone down to Valparaiso, where Garth had business to wind up, I was"
6286,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,enabled to study more intimately the morbid demon which possessed him.
6287,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,It was the most singular thing in the world: no man had hated the
6288,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"country more, had been more passionately determined for a period of"
6289,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,years to escape from it; and now that his chance was come the emotion
6290,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,with which he viewed it was nearer akin to terror than to the joy of a
6291,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,reasonable man who is about to compass the desire of his life. He had
6292,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"kept the covenant which he had made with himself; he was a rich man,"
6293,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"richer than he had ever meant to be. Even now he was full of vigour,"
6294,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"and not much past the threshold of middle age, and he was going home"
6295,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,to the woman whom for the best part of fifteen years he had adored
6296,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"with an unexampled constancy, whose fidelity had been to him all"
6297,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,through that exile as the shadow of a rock in a desert land: he was
6298,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,going home to an honourable marriage. But withal he was a man with an
6299,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,incurable sadness; miserable and afraid. It seemed to me at times that
6300,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"he would have been glad if she had kept her troth less well, had only"
6301,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"availed herself of that freedom which he gave her, to disregard her"
6302,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,promise. And this was the more strange in that I never doubted the
6303,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"strength of his attachment; it remained engrossing and unchanged, the"
6304,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,largest part of his life. No alien shadow had ever come between him
6305,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"and the memory of the little girl with the violet eyes, to whom he at"
6306,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,least was bound. But a shadow was there; fantastic it seemed to me at
6307,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"first, too grotesque to be met with argument, but in whose very lack"
6308,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"of substance, as I came to see, lay its ultimate strength. The notion"
6309,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"of the woman, which now she was, came between him and the girl whom he"
6310,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"had loved, whom he still loved with passion, and separated them. It"
6311,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"was only on our voyage home, when we walked the deck together"
6312,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"interminably during the hot, sleepless nights, that he first revealed"
6313,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"to me without subterfuge, the slow agony by which this phantom slew"
6314,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"him. And his old bitter conviction of the malignity of his luck, which"
6315,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"had lain dormant in the first flush of his material prosperity,"
6316,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"returned to him. The apparent change in it seemed to him just then,"
6317,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,the last irony of those hostile powers which had pursued him.
6318,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6319,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"'It came to me suddenly,' he said, 'just before I left Agnas, when I"
6320,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"had been adding up my pile and saw there was nothing to keep me, that"
6321,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,it was all wrong. I had been a blamed fool! I might have gone home
6322,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"years ago. Where is the best of my life? Burnt out, wasted, buried in"
6323,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"that cursed oven! Dollars? If I had all the metal in Chili, I couldn't"
6324,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,buy one day of youth. Her youth too; that has gone with the rest;
6325,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,that's the worst part!'
6326,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6327,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"Despite all my protests, his despondency increased as the steamer"
6328,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"ploughed her way towards England, with the ceaseless throb of her"
6329,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"screw, which was like the panting of a great beast. Once, when we had"
6330,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"been talking of other matters, of certain living poets whom he"
6331,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"favoured, he broke off with a quotation from the 'Prince's Progress'"
6332,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,of Miss Rossetti:
6333,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6334,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"'Ten years ago, five years ago,"
6335,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"One year ago,"
6336,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,Even then you had arrived in time;
6337,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,Though somewhat slow;
6338,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,Then you had known her living face
6339,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,Which now you cannot know.'
6340,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6341,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"He stopped sharply, with a tone in his voice which seemed to intend,"
6342,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"in the lines, a personal instance."
6343,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6344,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,'I beg your pardon!' I protested. 'I don't see the analogy. You
6345,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,haven't loitered; you don't come too late. A brave woman has waited
6346,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,for you; you have a fine felicity before you: it should be all the
6347,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"better, because you have won it laboriously. For heaven's sake, be"
6348,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"reasonable!' He shook his head sadly; then added, with a gesture of"
6349,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"sudden passion, looking out over the taffrail, at the heaving gray"
6350,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,waters: 'It's finished. I haven't any longer the courage.' 'Ah!' I
6351,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"exclaimed impatiently, 'say once for all, outright, that you are tired"
6352,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"of her, that you want to back out of it.' 'No,' he said drearily, 'it"
6353,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,isn't that. I can't reproach myself with the least wavering. I have
6354,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"had a single passion; I have given my life to it; it is there still,"
6355,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"consuming me. Only the girl I loved: it's as if she had died. Yes, she"
6356,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"is dead, as dead as Helen: and I have not the consolation of knowing"
6357,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,where they have laid her. Our marriage will be a ghastly mockery: a
6358,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"marriage of corpses. Her heart, how can she give it me? She gave it"
6359,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"years ago to the man I was, the man who is dead. We, who are left, are"
6360,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"nothing to one another, mere strangers.'"
6361,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6362,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,One could not argue with a perversity so infatuate: it was useless to
6363,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"point out, that in life a distinction so arbitrary as the one which"
6364,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"haunted him does not exist. It was only left me to wait, hoping that"
6365,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"in the actual event of their meeting, his malady would be healed. But"
6366,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"this meeting, would it ever be compassed? There were moments when his"
6367,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"dread of it seemed to have grown so extreme, that he would be capable"
6368,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"of any cowardice, any compromise to postpone it, to render it"
6369,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,impossible. He was afraid that she would read his revulsion in his
6370,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"eyes, would suspect how time and his very constancy had given her the"
6371,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,one rival with whom she could never compete; the memory of her old
6372,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"self, of her gracious girlhood, which was dead. Might not she too,"
6373,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"actually, welcome a reprieve; however readily she would have submitted"
6374,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"out of honour or lassitude, to a marriage which could only be a parody"
6375,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,of what might have been?
6376,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6377,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"At Lisbon, I hoped that he had settled these questions, had grown"
6378,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"reasonable and sane, for he wrote a long letter to her which was"
6379,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"subsequently a matter of much curiosity to me; and he wore, for a day"
6380,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"or two afterwards, an air almost of assurance which deceived me. I"
6381,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"wondered what he had put in that epistle, how far he had explained"
6382,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"himself, justified his curious attitude. Or was it simply a _résumé_,"
6383,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,a conclusion to those many letters which he had written at Agnas
6384,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"Blancas, the last one which he would ever address to the little girl"
6385,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,of the earlier photograph?
6386,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6387,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"Later, I would have given much to decide this, but she herself, the"
6388,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"woman who read it, maintained unbroken silence. In return, I kept a"
6389,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"secret from her, my private interpretation of the accident of his"
6390,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"death. It seemed to me a knowledge tragical enough for her, that he"
6391,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"should have died as he did, so nearly in English waters; within a few"
6392,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"days of the home coming, which they had passionately expected for"
6393,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,years.
6394,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,
6395,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"It would have been mere brutality to afflict her further, by lifting"
6396,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"the veil of obscurity, which hangs over that calm, moonless night, by"
6397,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"pointing to the note of intention in it. For it is in my experience,"
6398,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"that accidents so opportune do not in real life occur, and I could not"
6399,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"forget that, from Garth's point of view, death was certainly a"
6400,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"solution. Was it not, moreover, precisely a solution, which so little"
6401,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,time before he had the appearance of having found? Indeed when the
6402,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"first shock of his death was past, I could feel that it was after all"
6403,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"a solution: with his 'luck' to handicap him, he had perhaps avoided"
6404,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"worse things than the death he met. For the luck of such a man, is it"
6405,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"not his temperament, his character? Can any one escape from that? May"
6406,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"it not have been an escape for the poor devil himself, an escape too"
6407,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"for the woman who loved him, that he chose to drop down, fathoms down,"
6408,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"into the calm, irrecoverable depths of the Atlantic, when he did,"
6409,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"bearing with him at least an unspoilt ideal, and leaving her a memory"
6410,THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS,"that experience could never tarnish, nor custom stale?"
