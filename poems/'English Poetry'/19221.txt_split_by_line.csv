35,POET LAUREATE.,
36,POET LAUREATE.,
37,POET LAUREATE.,This book in its progress has recalled often to my memory a man with
38,POET LAUREATE.,"whose friendship we were once honoured, to whom no region of English"
39,POET LAUREATE.,"literature was unfamiliar, and who, whilst rich in all the noble gifts"
40,POET LAUREATE.,"of nature, was most eminently distinguished by the noblest and the"
41,POET LAUREATE.,"rarest,--just judgment and high-hearted patriotism. It would have been"
42,POET LAUREATE.,hence a peculiar pleasure and pride to dedicate what I have endeavoured
43,POET LAUREATE.,to make a true national Anthology of three centuries to Henry Hallam.
44,POET LAUREATE.,But he is beyond the reach of any human tokens of love and reverence;
45,POET LAUREATE.,and I desire therefore to place before it a name united with his by
46,POET LAUREATE.,"associations which, whilst Poetry retains her hold on the minds of"
47,POET LAUREATE.,"Englishmen, are not likely to be forgotten."
48,POET LAUREATE.,
49,POET LAUREATE.,"Your encouragement, given while traversing the wild scenery of Treryn"
50,POET LAUREATE.,"Dinas, led me to begin the work; and it has been completed under your"
51,POET LAUREATE.,advice and assistance. For the favour now asked I have thus a second
52,POET LAUREATE.,"reason: and to this I may add, the homage which is your right as Poet,"
53,POET LAUREATE.,"and the gratitude due to a Friend, whose regard I rate at no common"
54,POET LAUREATE.,value.
55,POET LAUREATE.,
56,POET LAUREATE.,"Permit me then to inscribe to yourself a book which, I hope, may be"
57,POET LAUREATE.,found by many a lifelong fountain of innocent and exalted pleasure; a
58,POET LAUREATE.,source of animation to friends when they meet; and able to sweeten
59,POET LAUREATE.,"solitude itself with best society,--with the companionship of the wise"
60,POET LAUREATE.,"and the good, with the beauty which the eye cannot see, and the music"
61,POET LAUREATE.,only heard in silence. If this Collection proves a store-house of
62,POET LAUREATE.,"delight to Labour and to Poverty,--if it teaches those indifferent to"
63,POET LAUREATE.,"the Poets to love them, and those who love them to love them more, the"
64,POET LAUREATE.,aim and the desire entertained in framing it will be fully accomplished.

71,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
72,PREFACE.,
73,PREFACE.,"This little Collection differs, it is believed, from others in the"
74,PREFACE.,attempt made to include in it all the best original Lyrical pieces and
75,PREFACE.,"Songs in our language, by writers not living,--and none beside the best."
76,PREFACE.,Many familiar verses will hence be met with; many also which should be
77,PREFACE.,familiar:--the Editor will regard as his fittest readers those who love
78,PREFACE.,"Poetry so well, that he can offer them nothing not already known and"
79,PREFACE.,valued. For those who take up the book in a serious and scholarly
80,PREFACE.,"spirit, the following remarks on the plan and the execution are added."
81,PREFACE.,
82,PREFACE.,The Editor is acquainted with no strict and exhaustive definition of
83,PREFACE.,Lyrical Poetry; but he has found the task of practical decision increase
84,PREFACE.,"in clearness and in facility as he advanced with the work, whilst"
85,PREFACE.,keeping in view a few simple principles. Lyrical has been here held
86,PREFACE.,"essentially to imply that each Poem shall turn on some single thought,"
87,PREFACE.,"feeling, or situation. In accordance with this, narrative, descriptive,"
88,PREFACE.,"and didactic poems,--unless accompanied by rapidity of movement,"
89,PREFACE.,"brevity, and the colouring of human passion,--have been excluded."
90,PREFACE.,"Humorous poetry, except in the very unfrequent instances where a truly"
91,PREFACE.,"poetical tone pervades the whole, with what is strictly personal,"
92,PREFACE.,"occasional, and religious, has been considered foreign to the idea of"
93,PREFACE.,"the book. Blank verse and the ten-syllable couplet, with all pieces"
94,PREFACE.,"markedly dramatic, have been rejected as alien from what is commonly"
95,PREFACE.,"understood by Song, and rarely conforming to Lyrical conditions in"
96,PREFACE.,"treatment. But it is not anticipated, nor is it possible, that all"
97,PREFACE.,"readers shall think the line accurately drawn. Some poems, as Gray's"
98,PREFACE.,"_Elegy_, the _Allegro_ and _Penseroso_, Wordsworth's _Ruth_ or"
99,PREFACE.,"Campbell's _Lord Ullin_, might be claimed with perhaps equal justice for"
100,PREFACE.,a narrative or descriptive selection: whilst with reference especially
101,PREFACE.,"to Ballads and Sonnets, the Editor can only state that he has taken his"
102,PREFACE.,utmost pains to decide without caprice or partiality.
103,PREFACE.,
104,PREFACE.,This also is all he can plead in regard to a point even more liable to
105,PREFACE.,question;--what degree of merit should give rank among the Best. That a
106,PREFACE.,"Poem shall be worthy of the writer's genius,--that it shall reach a"
107,PREFACE.,"perfection commensurate with its aim,--that we should require finish in"
108,PREFACE.,"proportion to brevity,--that passion, colour, and originality cannot"
109,PREFACE.,"atone for serious imperfections in clearness, unity, or truth,--that a"
110,PREFACE.,"few good lines do not make a good poem,--that popular estimate is"
111,PREFACE.,"serviceable as a guidepost more than as a compass,--above all, that"
112,PREFACE.,Excellence should be looked for rather in the Whole than in the
113,PREFACE.,"Parts,--such and other such canons have been always steadily regarded."
114,PREFACE.,"He may however add that the pieces chosen, and a far larger number"
115,PREFACE.,"rejected, have been carefully and repeatedly considered; and that he has"
116,PREFACE.,been aided throughout by two friends of independent and exercised
117,PREFACE.,"judgment, besides the distinguished person addressed in the Dedication."
118,PREFACE.,It is hoped that by this procedure the volume has been freed from that
119,PREFACE.,one-sidedness which must beset individual decisions:--but for the final
120,PREFACE.,choice the Editor is alone responsible.
121,PREFACE.,
122,PREFACE.,"Chalmers' vast collection, with the whole works of all accessible poets"
123,PREFACE.,"not contained in it, and the best Anthologies of different periods, have"
124,PREFACE.,been twice systematically read through: and it is hence improbable that
125,PREFACE.,any omissions which may be regretted are due to oversight. The poems are
126,PREFACE.,"printed entire, except in a very few instances (specified in the notes)"
127,PREFACE.,where a stanza has been omitted. The omissions have been risked only
128,PREFACE.,"when the piece could be thus brought to a closer lyrical unity: and, as"
129,PREFACE.,"essentially opposed to this unity, extracts, obviously such, are"
130,PREFACE.,"excluded. In regard to the text, the purpose of the book has appeared to"
131,PREFACE.,"justify the choice of the most poetical version, wherever more than one"
132,PREFACE.,"exists: and much labour has been given to present each poem, in"
133,PREFACE.,"disposition, spelling, and punctuation, to the greatest advantage."
134,PREFACE.,
135,PREFACE.,"In the arrangement, the most poetically effective order has been"
136,PREFACE.,attempted. The English mind has passed through phases of thought and
137,PREFACE.,cultivation so various and so opposed during these three centuries of
138,PREFACE.,"Poetry, that a rapid passage between Old and New, like rapid alteration"
139,PREFACE.,"of the eye's focus in looking at the landscape, will always be wearisome"
140,PREFACE.,and hurtful to the sense of Beauty. The poems have been therefore
141,PREFACE.,"distributed into Books corresponding, I. to the ninety years closing"
142,PREFACE.,"about 1616, II. thence to 1700, III. to 1800, IV. to the half century"
143,PREFACE.,"just ended. Or, looking at the Poets who more or less give each portion"
144,PREFACE.,"its distinctive character, they might be called the Books of"
145,PREFACE.,"Shakespeare, Milton, Gray, and Wordsworth. The volume, in this respect,"
146,PREFACE.,"so far as the limitations of its range allow, accurately reflects the"
147,PREFACE.,natural growth and evolution of our Poetry. A rigidly chronological
148,PREFACE.,"sequence, however, rather fits a collection aiming at instruction than"
149,PREFACE.,"at pleasure, and the Wisdom which comes through Pleasure:--within each"
150,PREFACE.,book the pieces have therefore been arranged in gradations of feeling or
151,PREFACE.,subject. The development of the symphonies of Mozart and Beethoven has
152,PREFACE.,"been here thought of as a model, and nothing placed without careful"
153,PREFACE.,consideration. And it is hoped that the contents of this Anthology will
154,PREFACE.,"thus be found to present a certain unity, ""as episodes,"" in the noble"
155,PREFACE.,"language of Shelley, ""to that great Poem which all poets, like the"
156,PREFACE.,"co-operating thoughts of one great mind, have built up since the"
157,PREFACE.,"beginning of the world."""
158,PREFACE.,
159,PREFACE.,"As he closes his long survey, the Editor trusts he may add without"
160,PREFACE.,"egotism, that he has found the vague general verdict of popular Fame"
161,PREFACE.,"more just than those have thought, who, with too severe a criticism,"
162,PREFACE.,"would confine judgments on Poetry to ""the selected few of many"
163,PREFACE.,"generations."" Not many appear to have gained reputation without some"
164,PREFACE.,"gift or performance that, in due degree, deserved it: and if no verses"
165,PREFACE.,"by certain writers who show less strength than sweetness, or more"
166,PREFACE.,"thought than mastery in expression, are printed in this volume, it"
167,PREFACE.,should not be imagined that they have been excluded without much
168,PREFACE.,"hesitation and regret,--far less that they have been slighted."
169,PREFACE.,"Throughout this vast and pathetic array of Singers now silent, few have"
170,PREFACE.,"been honoured with the name Poet, and have not possessed a skill in"
171,PREFACE.,"words, a sympathy with beauty, a tenderness of feeling, or seriousness"
172,PREFACE.,"in reflection, which render their works, although never perhaps"
173,PREFACE.,"attaining that loftier and finer excellence here required,--better worth"
174,PREFACE.,reading than much of what fills the scanty hours that most men spare for
175,PREFACE.,"self-improvement, or for pleasure in any of its more elevated and"
176,PREFACE.,permanent forms.
177,PREFACE.,
178,PREFACE.,"And if this be true of even mediocre poetry, for how much more are we"
179,PREFACE.,"indebted to the best! Like the fabled fountain of the Azores, but with a"
180,PREFACE.,"more various power, the magic of this Art can confer on each period of"
181,PREFACE.,"life its appropriate blessing: on early years Experience, on maturity"
182,PREFACE.,"Calm, on age Youthfulness. Poetry gives treasures ""more golden than"
183,PREFACE.,"gold,"" leading us in higher and healthier ways than those of the world,"
184,PREFACE.,and interpreting to us the lessons of Nature. But she speaks best for
185,PREFACE.,"herself. Her true accents, if the plan has been executed with success,"
186,PREFACE.,may be heard throughout the following pages:-wherever the Poets of
187,PREFACE.,"England are honoured, wherever the dominant language of the world is"
188,PREFACE.,"spoken, it is hoped that they will find fit audience."

204,SUMMARY.,
205,SUMMARY.,"The Elizabethan Poetry, as it is rather vaguely termed, forms the"
206,SUMMARY.,"substance of this Book, which contains pieces from Wyat under Henry"
207,SUMMARY.,"VIII. to Shakespeare midway through the reign of James I., and Drummond"
208,SUMMARY.,who carried on the early manner to a still later period. There is here a
209,SUMMARY.,wide range of style;--from simplicity expressed in a language hardly yet
210,SUMMARY.,"broken in to verse,--through the pastoral fancies and Italian conceits"
211,SUMMARY.,"of the strictly Elizabethan time,--to the passionate reality of"
212,SUMMARY.,Shakespeare: yet a general uniformity of tone prevails. Few readers can
213,SUMMARY.,"fail to observe the natural sweetness of the verse, the single-hearted"
214,SUMMARY.,"straightforwardness of the thoughts:--nor less, the limitation of"
215,SUMMARY.,"subject to the many phases of one passion, which then characterised our"
216,SUMMARY.,"lyrical poetry,--unless when, as with Drummond and Shakespeare, the"
217,SUMMARY.,"""purple light of Love"" is tempered by a spirit of sterner reflection."
218,SUMMARY.,
219,SUMMARY.,It should be observed that this and the following Summaries apply in the
220,SUMMARY.,"main to the Collection here presented, in which (besides its restriction"
221,SUMMARY.,to Lyrical Poetry) a strictly representative or historical Anthology has
222,SUMMARY.,"not been aimed at. Great Excellence, in human art as in human character,"
223,SUMMARY.,"has from the beginning of things been even more uniform than Mediocrity,"
224,SUMMARY.,by virtue of the closeness of its approach to Nature:--and so far as the
225,SUMMARY.,"standard of Excellence kept in view has been attained in this volume, a"
226,SUMMARY.,"comparative absence of extreme or temporary phases in style, a"
227,SUMMARY.,"similarity of tone and manner, will be found throughout:--something"
228,SUMMARY.,"neither modern nor ancient but true in all ages, and like the works of"
229,SUMMARY.,Creation perfect as on the first day.

1725,53. PROTHALAMION.,"Scatter'd with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,"
1726,53. PROTHALAMION.,"That they appear, through lilies' plenteous store,"

1728,53. PROTHALAMION.,Two of those nymphs meanwhile two garlands bound

2060,SUMMARY.,"This division, embracing the latter eighty years of the seventeenth"
2061,SUMMARY.,"century, contains the close of our Early poetical style and the"
2062,SUMMARY.,commencement of the Modern. In Dryden we see the first master of the
2063,SUMMARY.,"new: in Milton, whose genius dominates here as Shakespeare's in the"
2064,SUMMARY.,"former book,--the crown and consummation of the early period. Their"
2065,SUMMARY.,"splendid Odes are far in advance of any prior attempts, Spenser's"
2066,SUMMARY.,excepted: they exhibit the wider and grander range which years and
2067,SUMMARY.,experience and the struggles of the time conferred on Poetry. Poetry now
2068,SUMMARY.,"gave expression to political feeling, to religious thought, to a high"
2069,SUMMARY.,"philosophic statesmanship in writers such as Marvell, Herbert, and"
2070,SUMMARY.,"Wotton: whilst in Marvell and Milton, again, we find the first noble"
2071,SUMMARY.,"attempts at pure description of nature, destined in our own ages to be"
2072,SUMMARY.,"continued and equalled. Meanwhile the poetry of simple passion, although"
2073,SUMMARY.,"before 1660 often deformed by verbal fancies and conceits of thought,"
2074,SUMMARY.,"and afterward by levity and an artificial tone,--produced in Herrick and"
2075,SUMMARY.,Waller some charming pieces of more finished art than the Elizabethan:
2076,SUMMARY.,"until in the courtly compliments of Sedley it seems to exhaust itself,"
2077,SUMMARY.,and lie almost dormant for the hundred years between the days of Wither
2078,SUMMARY.,and Suckling and the days of Burns and Cowper.--That the change from our
2079,SUMMARY.,early style to the modern brought with it at first a loss of nature and
2080,SUMMARY.,simplicity is undeniable: yet the far bolder and wider scope which
2081,SUMMARY.,"Poetry took between 1620 and 1700, and the successful efforts then made"
2082,SUMMARY.,"to gain greater clearness in expression, in their results have been no"
2083,SUMMARY.,slight compensation.

2128,THE HYMN.,Nature in awe to Him
2129,THE HYMN.,"Had doff'd her gaudy trim,"

2133,THE HYMN.,
2134,THE HYMN.,Only with speeches fair

2151,THE HYMN.,
2152,THE HYMN.,"No war, or battle's sound"
2153,THE HYMN.,Was heard the world around:
2154,THE HYMN.,The idle spear and shield were high up hung;
2155,THE HYMN.,The hookéd Chariot stood
2156,THE HYMN.,Unstain'd with hostile blood;

2164,THE HYMN.,"The winds, with wonder whist,"
2165,THE HYMN.,Smoothly the waters kist
2166,THE HYMN.,Whispering new joys to the mild oceán--

2169,THE HYMN.,
2170,THE HYMN.,The stars with deep amaze
2171,THE HYMN.,"Stand fix'd in steadfast gaze,"
2172,THE HYMN.,Bending one way their precious influence;
2173,THE HYMN.,And will not take their flight
2174,THE HYMN.,"For all the morning light,"
2175,THE HYMN.,Or Lucifer that often warn'd them thence;
2176,THE HYMN.,"But in their glimmering orbs did glow,"
2177,THE HYMN.,"Until their Lord Himself bespake, and bid them go."
2178,THE HYMN.,
2179,THE HYMN.,And though the shady gloom
2180,THE HYMN.,"Had given day her room,"
2181,THE HYMN.,"The sun himself withheld his wonted speed,"
2182,THE HYMN.,"And hid his head for shame,"
2183,THE HYMN.,As his inferior flame
2184,THE HYMN.,The new-enlightn'd world no more should need:
2185,THE HYMN.,He saw a greater Sun appear

2188,THE HYMN.,The shepherds on the lawn
2189,THE HYMN.,Or ere the point of dawn
2190,THE HYMN.,Sate simply chatting in a rustic row;
2191,THE HYMN.,Full little thought they then
2192,THE HYMN.,That the mighty Pan
2193,THE HYMN.,Was kindly come to live with them below;
2194,THE HYMN.,"Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep"
2195,THE HYMN.,Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.
2196,THE HYMN.,
2197,THE HYMN.,When such music sweet
2198,THE HYMN.,Their hearts and ears did greet
2199,THE HYMN.,As never was by mortal finger strook--
2200,THE HYMN.,Divinely-warbled voice
2201,THE HYMN.,"Answering the stringéd noise,"
2202,THE HYMN.,As all their souls in blissful rapture took:
2203,THE HYMN.,"The air, such pleasure loth to lose,"
2204,THE HYMN.,With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.
2205,THE HYMN.,
2206,THE HYMN.,Nature that heard such sound
2207,THE HYMN.,Beneath the hollow round
2208,THE HYMN.,"Of Cynthia's seat the airy region thrilling,"
2209,THE HYMN.,Now was almost won
2210,THE HYMN.,"To think her part was done,"
2211,THE HYMN.,And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;
2212,THE HYMN.,She knew such harmony alone
2213,THE HYMN.,Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union.
2214,THE HYMN.,
2215,THE HYMN.,At last surrounds their sight
2216,THE HYMN.,A globe of circular light
2217,THE HYMN.,That with long beams the shamefaced night array'd;
2218,THE HYMN.,The helméd Cherubim
2219,THE HYMN.,"And sworded Seraphim,"
2220,THE HYMN.,"Are seen in glittering ranks with wings display'd,"
2221,THE HYMN.,Harping in loud and solemn quire
2222,THE HYMN.,"With unexpressive notes, to Heaven's new-born Heir."
2223,THE HYMN.,
2224,THE HYMN.,Such music (as 'tis said)
2225,THE HYMN.,Before was never made
2226,THE HYMN.,"But when of old the sons of morning sung,"
2227,THE HYMN.,While the Creator great
2228,THE HYMN.,His constellations set
2229,THE HYMN.,And the well-balanced world on hinges hung;
2230,THE HYMN.,"And cast the dark foundations deep,"
2231,THE HYMN.,And bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep.
2232,THE HYMN.,
2233,THE HYMN.,"Ring out, ye crystal spheres!"
2234,THE HYMN.,"Once bless our human ears,"
2235,THE HYMN.,If ye have power to touch our senses so;
2236,THE HYMN.,And let your silver chime
2237,THE HYMN.,Move in melodious time;
2238,THE HYMN.,And let the bass of heaven's deep organ blow;
2239,THE HYMN.,And with your ninefold harmony
2240,THE HYMN.,Make up full concert to the angelic symphony.
2241,THE HYMN.,
2242,THE HYMN.,For if such holy Song
2243,THE HYMN.,"Enwrap our fancy long,"
2244,THE HYMN.,"Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold;"
2245,THE HYMN.,And speckled vanity
2246,THE HYMN.,"Will sicken soon and die,"
2247,THE HYMN.,And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould;
2248,THE HYMN.,"And Hell itself will pass away,"
2249,THE HYMN.,And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.
2250,THE HYMN.,
2251,THE HYMN.,"Yea, Truth and Justice then"
2252,THE HYMN.,"Will down return to men,"
2253,THE HYMN.,"Orb'd in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,"
2254,THE HYMN.,Mercy will sit between
2255,THE HYMN.,"Throned in celestial sheen,"
2256,THE HYMN.,With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering;
2257,THE HYMN.,"And Heaven, as at some festival,"
2258,THE HYMN.,Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.
2259,THE HYMN.,
2260,THE HYMN.,But wisest Fate says No;
2261,THE HYMN.,This must not yet be so;
2262,THE HYMN.,The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy
2263,THE HYMN.,That on the bitter cross
2264,THE HYMN.,Must redeem our loss;
2265,THE HYMN.,So both Himself and us to glorify:
2266,THE HYMN.,Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep
2267,THE HYMN.,The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep;
2268,THE HYMN.,
2269,THE HYMN.,With such a horrid clang
2270,THE HYMN.,As on mount Sinai rang
2271,THE HYMN.,While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake:
2272,THE HYMN.,The aged Earth agast
2273,THE HYMN.,With terrour of that blast
2274,THE HYMN.,"Shall from the surface to the centre shake,"
2275,THE HYMN.,"When at the worlds last sessión,"
2276,THE HYMN.,The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread His throne.
2277,THE HYMN.,
2278,THE HYMN.,And then at last our bliss
2279,THE HYMN.,"Full and perfect is,"
2280,THE HYMN.,But now begins; for from this happy day
2281,THE HYMN.,"The old Dragon, under ground"
2282,THE HYMN.,"In straiter limits bound,"
2283,THE HYMN.,Not half so far casts his usurpéd sway;
2284,THE HYMN.,"And, wroth to see his Kingdom fail,"
2285,THE HYMN.,Swinges the scaly horrour of his folded tail.
2286,THE HYMN.,
2287,THE HYMN.,The oracles are dumb;
2288,THE HYMN.,No voice or hideous hum
2289,THE HYMN.,Runs through the archéd roof in words deceiving:
2290,THE HYMN.,Apollo from his shrine
2291,THE HYMN.,"Can no more divine,"
2292,THE HYMN.,With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving:
2293,THE HYMN.,No nightly trance or breathéd spell
2294,THE HYMN.,Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.
2295,THE HYMN.,
2296,THE HYMN.,The lonely mountains o'er
2297,THE HYMN.,And the resounding shore

2300,THE HYMN.,Edged with poplar pale
2301,THE HYMN.,The parting Genius is with sighing sent;
2302,THE HYMN.,With flower-inwoven tresses torn
2303,THE HYMN.,The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.
2304,THE HYMN.,
2305,THE HYMN.,In consecrated earth
2306,THE HYMN.,"And on the holy hearth,"
2307,THE HYMN.,The Lars and Lemurés moan with midnight plaint;
2308,THE HYMN.,"In urns, and altars round"
2309,THE HYMN.,A drear and dying sound
2310,THE HYMN.,Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;

2317,THE HYMN.,And moonéd Ashtaroth
2318,THE HYMN.,"Heaven's queen and mother both,"
2319,THE HYMN.,Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine;

2322,THE HYMN.,
2323,THE HYMN.,"And sullen Moloch, fled,"
2324,THE HYMN.,Hath left in shadows dread
2325,THE HYMN.,His burning idol all of blackest hue;
2326,THE HYMN.,In vain with cymbals' ring
2327,THE HYMN.,"They call the grisly king,"
2328,THE HYMN.,In dismal dance about the furnace blue;
2329,THE HYMN.,The brutish gods of Nile as fast
2330,THE HYMN.,"Isis and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste."
2331,THE HYMN.,
2332,THE HYMN.,Nor is Osiris seen
2333,THE HYMN.,"In Memphian grove, or green,"
2334,THE HYMN.,Trampling the unshower'd grass with lowings loud:
2335,THE HYMN.,Nor can he be at rest
2336,THE HYMN.,Within his sacred chest;
2337,THE HYMN.,Naught but profoundest hell can be his shroud;
2338,THE HYMN.,In vain with timbrell'd anthems dark
2339,THE HYMN.,The sable stoléd sorcerers bear his worshipt ark.
2340,THE HYMN.,
2341,THE HYMN.,He feels from Juda's land
2342,THE HYMN.,The dreaded infant's hand;
2343,THE HYMN.,The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;
2344,THE HYMN.,Nor all the gods beside
2345,THE HYMN.,"Longer dare abide,"
2346,THE HYMN.,Nor Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:
2347,THE HYMN.,"Our Babe, to shew his Godhead true,"
2348,THE HYMN.,Can in his swaddling bands control the damnéd crew.
2349,THE HYMN.,
2350,THE HYMN.,"So, when the sun in bed"
2351,THE HYMN.,Curtain'd with cloudy red
2352,THE HYMN.,"Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,"
2353,THE HYMN.,The flocking shadows pale
2354,THE HYMN.,"Troop to the infernal jail,"
2355,THE HYMN.,Each fetter'd ghost slips to his several grave;
2356,THE HYMN.,And the yellow-skirted fays
2357,THE HYMN.,"Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze."
2358,THE HYMN.,
2359,THE HYMN.,"But see, the Virgin blest"
2360,THE HYMN.,Hath laid her Babe to rest;
2361,THE HYMN.,"Time is, our tedious song should here have ending:"
2362,THE HYMN.,"Heavens youngest-teeméd star,"
2363,THE HYMN.,"Hath fixed her polish'd car,"
2364,THE HYMN.,Her sleeping Lord with hand-maid lamp attending:

2637,66. LYCIDAS,_Elegy on a Friend drowned in the Irish Channel._
2638,66. LYCIDAS,
2639,66. LYCIDAS,"Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more"
2640,66. LYCIDAS,"Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,"
2641,66. LYCIDAS,"I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude,"
2642,66. LYCIDAS,And with forced fingers rude
2643,66. LYCIDAS,Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year.
2644,66. LYCIDAS,"Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear"
2645,66. LYCIDAS,Compels me to disturb your season due:
2646,66. LYCIDAS,"For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,"
2647,66. LYCIDAS,"Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer:"
2648,66. LYCIDAS,Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew
2649,66. LYCIDAS,"Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme."
2650,66. LYCIDAS,He must not float upon his watery bier
2651,66. LYCIDAS,"Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,"
2652,66. LYCIDAS,Without the meed of some melodious tear.
2653,66. LYCIDAS,
2654,66. LYCIDAS,"Begin, then, Sisters of the sacred well"
2655,66. LYCIDAS,That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring;
2656,66. LYCIDAS,"Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string;"
2657,66. LYCIDAS,Hence with denial vain and coy excuse:
2658,66. LYCIDAS,So may some gentle Muse
2659,66. LYCIDAS,With lucky words favour my destined urn:
2660,66. LYCIDAS,"And as he passes, turn"
2661,66. LYCIDAS,And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud.
2662,66. LYCIDAS,
2663,66. LYCIDAS,"For we were nursed upon the self-same hill,"
2664,66. LYCIDAS,"Fed the same flock by fountain, shade, and rill:"
2665,66. LYCIDAS,"Together both, ere the high lawns appear'd"
2666,66. LYCIDAS,"Under the opening eye-lids of the morn,"
2667,66. LYCIDAS,"We drove a-field, and both together heard"
2668,66. LYCIDAS,"What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn,"
2669,66. LYCIDAS,"Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,"
2670,66. LYCIDAS,Oft till the star that rose at evening bright
2671,66. LYCIDAS,Toward heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel.
2672,66. LYCIDAS,Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute;
2673,66. LYCIDAS,"Temper'd to the oaten flute,"
2674,66. LYCIDAS,"Rough Satyrs danced, and Fauns with cloven heel"
2675,66. LYCIDAS,From the glad sound would not be absent long;
2676,66. LYCIDAS,And old Damoetas loved to hear our song.
2677,66. LYCIDAS,
2678,66. LYCIDAS,"But, O the heavy change, now thou art gone,"
2679,66. LYCIDAS,Now thou art gone and never must return!
2680,66. LYCIDAS,"Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods, and desert caves,"
2681,66. LYCIDAS,"With wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown,"
2682,66. LYCIDAS,"And all their echoes, mourn."
2683,66. LYCIDAS,The willows and the hazel copses green
2684,66. LYCIDAS,Shall now no more be seen
2685,66. LYCIDAS,Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays:--
2686,66. LYCIDAS,"As killing as the canker to the rose,"
2687,66. LYCIDAS,"Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,"
2688,66. LYCIDAS,"Or frost to flowers, that their gay wardrobe wear,"
2689,66. LYCIDAS,When first the white-thorn blows;
2690,66. LYCIDAS,"Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherds' ear."
2691,66. LYCIDAS,
2692,66. LYCIDAS,"Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep"
2693,66. LYCIDAS,Closed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas?
2694,66. LYCIDAS,For neither were ye playing on the steep
2695,66. LYCIDAS,"Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,"
2696,66. LYCIDAS,"Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,"
2697,66. LYCIDAS,Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream.
2698,66. LYCIDAS,Ay me! I fondly dream--
2699,66. LYCIDAS,Had ye been there--for what could that have done?
2700,66. LYCIDAS,"What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,"
2701,66. LYCIDAS,"The Muse herself, for her enchanting son,"
2702,66. LYCIDAS,"Whom universal nature did lament,"
2703,66. LYCIDAS,When by the rout that made the hideous roar
2704,66. LYCIDAS,"His gory visage down the stream was sent,"
2705,66. LYCIDAS,Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?
2706,66. LYCIDAS,
2707,66. LYCIDAS,Alas! what boots it with incessant care
2708,66. LYCIDAS,"To tend the homely, slighted, shepherd's trade"
2709,66. LYCIDAS,And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?
2710,66. LYCIDAS,"Were it not better done, as others use,"
2711,66. LYCIDAS,"To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,"
2712,66. LYCIDAS,Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?
2713,66. LYCIDAS,Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
2714,66. LYCIDAS,(That last infirmity of noble mind)
2715,66. LYCIDAS,To scorn delights and live laborious days;
2716,66. LYCIDAS,"But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,"
2717,66. LYCIDAS,"And think to burst out into sudden blaze,"
2718,66. LYCIDAS,Comes the blind Fury with the abhorréd shears
2719,66. LYCIDAS,"And slits the thin-spun life. ""But not the praise,"""
2720,66. LYCIDAS,"Phoebus replied, and touch'd my trembling ears;"
2721,66. LYCIDAS,"""Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,"
2722,66. LYCIDAS,Nor in the glistering foil
2723,66. LYCIDAS,"Set off to the world, nor in broad rumour lies:"
2724,66. LYCIDAS,But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes
2725,66. LYCIDAS,And perfect witness of all-judging Jove;
2726,66. LYCIDAS,"As he pronounces lastly on each deed,"
2727,66. LYCIDAS,"Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed."""
2728,66. LYCIDAS,
2729,66. LYCIDAS,"O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour'd flood"
2730,66. LYCIDAS,"Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown'd with vocal reeds!"
2731,66. LYCIDAS,That strain I heard was of a higher mood:
2732,66. LYCIDAS,"But now my oat proceeds,"
2733,66. LYCIDAS,And listens to the herald of the sea
2734,66. LYCIDAS,That came in Neptune's plea;
2735,66. LYCIDAS,"He ask'd the waves, and ask'd the felon winds,"
2736,66. LYCIDAS,What hard mishap hath doom'd this gentle swain?
2737,66. LYCIDAS,And question'd every gust of rugged wings
2738,66. LYCIDAS,That blows from off each beakéd promontory:
2739,66. LYCIDAS,They knew not of his story;
2740,66. LYCIDAS,"And sage Hippotadés their answer brings,"
2741,66. LYCIDAS,That not a blast was from his dungeon stray'd;
2742,66. LYCIDAS,"The air was calm, and on the level brine"
2743,66. LYCIDAS,Sleek Panopé with all her sisters play'd.
2744,66. LYCIDAS,It was that fatal and perfidious bark
2745,66. LYCIDAS,"Built in the eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark,"
2746,66. LYCIDAS,That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.
2747,66. LYCIDAS,
2748,66. LYCIDAS,"Next, Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow,"
2749,66. LYCIDAS,"His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge"
2750,66. LYCIDAS,"Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge"
2751,66. LYCIDAS,Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe:
2752,66. LYCIDAS,"""Ah! who hath reft,"" quoth he, ""my dearest pledge!"""
2753,66. LYCIDAS,"Last came, and last did go"
2754,66. LYCIDAS,The pilot of the Galilean Lake;
2755,66. LYCIDAS,Two massy keys he bore of metals twain
2756,66. LYCIDAS,"(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain);"
2757,66. LYCIDAS,"He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:"
2758,66. LYCIDAS,"""How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,"
2759,66. LYCIDAS,"Enow of such, as for their bellies' sake"
2760,66. LYCIDAS,Creep and intrude and climb into the fold!
2761,66. LYCIDAS,Of other care they little reckoning make
2762,66. LYCIDAS,"Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast,"
2763,66. LYCIDAS,And shove away the worthy bidden guest;
2764,66. LYCIDAS,Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold
2765,66. LYCIDAS,"A sheep-hook, or have learn'd aught else the least"
2766,66. LYCIDAS,That to the faithful herdman's art belongs!
2767,66. LYCIDAS,What recks it them? What need they? They are sped;
2768,66. LYCIDAS,"And, when they list, their lean and flashy songs"
2769,66. LYCIDAS,Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;
2770,66. LYCIDAS,"The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,"
2771,66. LYCIDAS,"But, swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw"
2772,66. LYCIDAS,"Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:"
2773,66. LYCIDAS,Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
2774,66. LYCIDAS,"Daily devours apace, and nothing said:"
2775,66. LYCIDAS,--But that two-handed engine at the door
2776,66. LYCIDAS,"Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more."""
2777,66. LYCIDAS,
2778,66. LYCIDAS,"Return, Alphéus; the dread voice is past"
2779,66. LYCIDAS,"That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse,"
2780,66. LYCIDAS,"And call the vales, and bid them hither cast"
2781,66. LYCIDAS,Their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues.
2782,66. LYCIDAS,"Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use"
2783,66. LYCIDAS,"Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks"
2784,66. LYCIDAS,On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks;
2785,66. LYCIDAS,Throw hither all your quaint enamell'd eyes
2786,66. LYCIDAS,That on the green turf suck the honey'd showers
2787,66. LYCIDAS,And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.
2788,66. LYCIDAS,"Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,"
2789,66. LYCIDAS,"The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,"
2790,66. LYCIDAS,"The white pink, and the pansy freak'd with jet,"
2791,66. LYCIDAS,"The glowing violet,"
2792,66. LYCIDAS,"The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,"
2793,66. LYCIDAS,"With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,"
2794,66. LYCIDAS,And every flower that sad embroidery wears:
2795,66. LYCIDAS,"Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed,"
2796,66. LYCIDAS,And daffodillies fill their cups with tears
2797,66. LYCIDAS,To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies.
2798,66. LYCIDAS,"For so to interpose a little ease,"
2799,66. LYCIDAS,Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise;
2800,66. LYCIDAS,Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
2801,66. LYCIDAS,"Wash far away,--where'er thy bones are hurl'd;"
2802,66. LYCIDAS,Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides
2803,66. LYCIDAS,"Where thou perhaps, under the whelming tide"
2804,66. LYCIDAS,Visitest the bottom of the monstrous world;
2805,66. LYCIDAS,"Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,"
2806,66. LYCIDAS,"Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,"
2807,66. LYCIDAS,Where the great Vision of the guarded mount
2808,66. LYCIDAS,"Looks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold,"
2809,66. LYCIDAS,"--Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth:"
2810,66. LYCIDAS,"--And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth!"
2811,66. LYCIDAS,
2812,66. LYCIDAS,"Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,"
2813,66. LYCIDAS,"For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,"
2814,66. LYCIDAS,Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor;
2815,66. LYCIDAS,"So sinks the day-star in the ocean-bed,"
2816,66. LYCIDAS,And yet anon repairs his drooping head
2817,66. LYCIDAS,"And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore"
2818,66. LYCIDAS,Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:
2819,66. LYCIDAS,"So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high"
2820,66. LYCIDAS,Through the dear might of Him that walk'd the waves;
2821,66. LYCIDAS,"Where, other groves and other streams along,"
2822,66. LYCIDAS,"With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,"
2823,66. LYCIDAS,And hears the unexpressive nuptial song
2824,66. LYCIDAS,In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love.
2825,66. LYCIDAS,There entertain him all the saints above
2826,66. LYCIDAS,"In solemn troops, and sweet societies,"
2827,66. LYCIDAS,"That sing, and singing, in their glory move,"
2828,66. LYCIDAS,And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.
2829,66. LYCIDAS,"Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;"
2830,66. LYCIDAS,"Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore,"
2831,66. LYCIDAS,"In thy large recompense, and shalt be good"
2832,66. LYCIDAS,To all that wander in that perilous flood.
2833,66. LYCIDAS,
2834,66. LYCIDAS,"Thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills,"
2835,66. LYCIDAS,While the still morn went out with sandals gray;
2836,66. LYCIDAS,"He touch'd the tender stops of various quills,"
2837,66. LYCIDAS,With eager thought warbling his Doric lay:
2838,66. LYCIDAS,"And now the sun had stretch'd out all the hills,"
2839,66. LYCIDAS,And now was dropt into the western bay:
2840,66. LYCIDAS,"At last he rose, and twitch'd his mantle blue:"
2841,66. LYCIDAS,"To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new."

4941,SUMMARY.,
4942,SUMMARY.,It is more difficult to characterise the English Poetry of the
4943,SUMMARY.,eighteenth century than that of any other. For it was an age not only of
4944,SUMMARY.,"spontaneous transition, but of bold experiment: it includes not only"
4945,SUMMARY.,"such divergences of thought as distinguished the ""Rape of the Lock"" from"
4946,SUMMARY.,"the ""Parish Register,"" but such vast contemporaneous differences as lie"
4947,SUMMARY.,"between Pope and Collins, Burns and Cowper. Yet we may clearly trace"
4948,SUMMARY.,three leading moods or tendencies:--the aspects of courtly or educated
4949,SUMMARY.,life represented by Pope and carried to exhaustion by his followers; the
4950,SUMMARY.,"poetry of Nature and of Man, viewed through a cultivated, and at the"
4951,SUMMARY.,"same time an impassioned frame of mind by Collins and Gray:--lastly, the"
4952,SUMMARY.,"study of vivid and simple narrative, including natural description,"
4953,SUMMARY.,"begun by Gay and Thomson, pursued by Burns and others in the north, and"
4954,SUMMARY.,"established in England by Goldsmith, Percy, Crabbe, and Cowper. Great"
4955,SUMMARY.,varieties in style accompanied these diversities in aim: poets could not
4956,SUMMARY.,always distinguish the manner suitable for subjects so far apart; and
4957,SUMMARY.,"the union of the language of courtly and of common life, exhibited most"
4958,SUMMARY.,"conspicuously by Burns, has given a tone to the poetry of that century"
4959,SUMMARY.,which is better explained by reference to its historical origin than by
4960,SUMMARY.,"naming it, in the common criticism of our day, artificial. There is"
4961,SUMMARY.,"again, a nobleness of thought, a courageous aim at high and, in a strict"
4962,SUMMARY.,"sense manly, excellence in many of the writers:--nor can that period be"
4963,SUMMARY.,"justly termed tame and wanting in originality, which produced poems such"
4964,SUMMARY.,"as Pope's Satires, Gray's Odes and Elegy, the ballads of Gay and Carey,"
4965,SUMMARY.,the songs of Burns and Cowper. In truth Poetry at this as at all times
4966,SUMMARY.,was a more or less unconscious mirror of the genius of the age; and the
4967,SUMMARY.,brave and admirable spirit of Enquiry which made the eighteenth century
4968,SUMMARY.,the turning-time in European civilisation is reflected faithfully in its
4969,SUMMARY.,verse. An intelligent reader will find the influence of Newton as
4970,SUMMARY.,"markedly in the poems of Pope, as of Elizabeth in the plays of"
4971,SUMMARY.,"Shakespeare. On this great subject, however, these indications must here"
4972,SUMMARY.,be sufficient.

7548,SUMMARY.,"It proves sufficiently the lavish wealth of our own age in Poetry, that"
7549,SUMMARY.,"the pieces which, without conscious departure from the standard of"
7550,SUMMARY.,"Excellence, render this Book by far the longest, were with very few"
7551,SUMMARY.,exceptions composed during the first thirty years the nineteenth
7552,SUMMARY.,century. Exhaustive reasons can hardly be given for the strangely sudden
7553,SUMMARY.,"appearance of individual genius: but none, in the Editor's judgment, can"
7554,SUMMARY.,be less adequate than that which assigns the splendid national
7555,SUMMARY.,"achievements of our recent poetry, to an impulse from the frantic"
7556,SUMMARY.,follies and criminal wars that at the time disgraced the least
7557,SUMMARY.,essentially civilised of our foreign neighbours. The first French
7558,SUMMARY.,"Revolution was rather, in his opinion, one result, and in itself by no"
7559,SUMMARY.,"means the most important, of that far wider and greater spirit which"
7560,SUMMARY.,"through enquiry and doubt, through pain and triumph, sweeps mankind"
7561,SUMMARY.,round the circles of its gradual development: and it is to this that we
7562,SUMMARY.,"must trace the literature of modern Europe. But, without more detailed"
7563,SUMMARY.,"discussion on the motive causes of Scott, Wordsworth, Campbell, Keats,"
7564,SUMMARY.,"and Shelley, we may observe that these Poets, with others, carried to"
7565,SUMMARY.,"further perfection the later tendencies of the Century preceding, in"
7566,SUMMARY.,"simplicity of narrative, reverence for human Passion and Character in"
7567,SUMMARY.,"every sphere, and impassioned love of Nature:--that, whilst maintaining"
7568,SUMMARY.,"on the whole the advances in art made since the Restoration, they"
7569,SUMMARY.,renewed the half-forgotten melody and depth of tone which marked the
7570,SUMMARY.,"best Elizabethan writers:--that, lastly, to what was thus inherited they"
7571,SUMMARY.,"added a richness in language and a variety in metre, a force and fire in"
7572,SUMMARY.,"narrative, a tenderness and bloom in feeling, an insight into the finer"
7573,SUMMARY.,"passages of the Soul and the inner meanings of the landscape, a larger"
7574,SUMMARY.,"and wiser Humanity,--hitherto hardly attained, and perhaps unattainable"
7575,SUMMARY.,"even by predecessors of not inferior individual genius. In a word, the"
7576,SUMMARY.,"Nation which, after the Greeks in their glory, has been the most gifted"
7577,SUMMARY.,"of all nations for Poetry, expressed in these men the highest strength"
7578,SUMMARY.,and prodigality of its nature. They interpreted the age to itself--hence
7579,SUMMARY.,the many phases of thought and style they present:--to sympathise with
7580,SUMMARY.,"each, fervently and impartially, without fear and without fancifulness,"
7581,SUMMARY.,"is no doubtful step in the higher education of the Soul. For, as with"
7582,SUMMARY.,"the Affections and the Conscience, Purity in Taste is absolutely"
7583,SUMMARY.,proportionate to Strength:--and when once the mind has raised itself to
7584,SUMMARY.,"grasp and to delight in Excellence, those who love most will be found to"
7585,SUMMARY.,love most wisely.

7703,168. LOVE.,I told her of the Knight that wore

7721,168. LOVE.,Nor rested day nor night;
7722,168. LOVE.,

7727,168. LOVE.,
7728,168. LOVE.,There came and look'd him in the face
7729,168. LOVE.,An angel beautiful and bright;
7730,168. LOVE.,"And that he knew it was a Fiend,"

7733,168. LOVE.,"And that unknowing what he did,"
7734,168. LOVE.,"He leap'd amid a murderous band,"
7735,168. LOVE.,And saved from outrage worse than death
7736,168. LOVE.,The Lady of the Land;
7737,168. LOVE.,
7738,168. LOVE.,"And how she wept, and clasp'd his knees;"

7741,168. LOVE.,The scorn that crazed his brain;
7742,168. LOVE.,
7743,168. LOVE.,"And that she nursed him in a cave,"

7745,168. LOVE.,When on the yellow forest-leaves
7746,168. LOVE.,A dying man he lay;
7747,168. LOVE.,
7748,168. LOVE.,--His dying words--but when I reach'd
7749,168. LOVE.,"That tenderest strain of all the ditty,"
7750,168. LOVE.,My faltering voice and pausing harp
7751,168. LOVE.,Disturb'd her soul with pity!
7752,168. LOVE.,
7753,168. LOVE.,All impulses of soul and sense

7762,168. LOVE.,
7763,168. LOVE.,"She wept with pity and delight,"
7764,168. LOVE.,"She blush'd with love, and virgin shame;"
7765,168. LOVE.,"And like the murmur of a dream,"
7766,168. LOVE.,I heard her breathe my name.
7767,168. LOVE.,
7768,168. LOVE.,"Her bosom heaved--she stepp'd aside,"
7769,168. LOVE.,As conscious of my look she stept--
7770,168. LOVE.,"Then suddenly, with timorous eye"
7771,168. LOVE.,She fled to me and wept.
7772,168. LOVE.,
7773,168. LOVE.,"She half enclosed me with her arms,"
7774,168. LOVE.,She press'd me with a meek embrace;
7775,168. LOVE.,"And bending back her head, look'd up,"
7776,168. LOVE.,And gazed upon my face.
7777,168. LOVE.,
7778,168. LOVE.,"'Twas partly love, and partly fear,"
7779,168. LOVE.,"And partly 'twas a bashful art,"

7781,168. LOVE.,The swelling of her heart.
7782,168. LOVE.,
7783,168. LOVE.,"I calm'd her fears, and she was calm,"

13620,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,"
13621,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"The earth, and every common sight"
13622,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,To me did seem
13623,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Apparell'd in celestial light,"
13624,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The glory and the freshness of a dream.
13625,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,It is not now as it hath been of yore;--
13626,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Turn wheresoe'er I may,"
13627,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"By night or day,"
13628,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The things which I have seen I now can see no more!
13629,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,
13630,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"The rainbow comes and goes,"
13631,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And lovely is the rose;
13632,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The moon doth with delight
13633,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Look round her when the heavens are bare;
13634,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Waters on a starry night
13635,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Are beautiful and fair;
13636,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The sunshine is a glorious birth;
13637,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"But yet I know, where'er I go,"
13638,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,That there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth.
13639,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,
13640,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,"
13641,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And while the young lambs bound
13642,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"As to the tabor's sound,"
13643,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,To me alone there came a thought of grief:
13644,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"A timely utterance gave that thought relief,"
13645,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And I again am strong.
13646,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep,--"
13647,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,No more shall grief of mine the season wrong:
13648,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"I hear the echoes through the mountains throng,"
13649,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,"
13650,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And all the earth is gay;
13651,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Land and sea
13652,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Give themselves up to jollity,"
13653,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And with the heart of May
13654,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Doth every beast keep holiday;--
13655,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Thou child of joy,"
13656,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy"
13657,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Shepherd boy!
13658,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,
13659,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Ye blesséd creatures, I have heard the call"
13660,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Ye to each other make; I see
13661,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
13662,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"My heart is at your festival,"
13663,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"My head hath its coronal,"
13664,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"The fulness of your bliss, I feel--I feel it all."
13665,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,O evil day! if I were sullen
13666,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,While Earth herself is adorning
13667,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"This sweet May morning,"
13668,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And the children are pulling
13669,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,On every side
13670,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,In a thousand valleys far and wide
13671,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,"
13672,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And the babe leaps up on his mother's arm:--
13673,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!"
13674,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"--But there's a tree, of many, one,"
13675,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"A single field which I have look'd upon,"
13676,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Both of them speak of something that is gone:
13677,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The pansy at my feet
13678,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Doth the same tale repeat:
13679,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
13680,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"
13681,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,
13682,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;
13683,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,"
13684,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Hath had elsewhere its setting
13685,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And cometh from afar;
13686,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Not in entire forgetfulness
13687,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And not in utter nakedness
13688,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,But trailing clouds of glory do we come
13689,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"From God, who is our home:"
13690,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
13691,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Shades of the prison-house begin to close
13692,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Upon the growing boy,"
13693,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,"
13694,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"He sees it in his joy,"
13695,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"The youth, who daily farther from the east"
13696,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Must travel, still is Nature's priest,"
13697,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And by the vision splendid
13698,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Is on his way attended;
13699,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"At length the man perceives it die away,"

13702,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
13703,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,"
13704,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"And, even with something of a mother's mind,"
13705,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"And no unworthy aim,"
13706,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The homely nurse doth all she can
13707,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"To make her foster-child, her inmate, Man,"
13708,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Forget the glories he hath known
13709,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And that imperial palace whence he came.
13710,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,
13711,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,"
13712,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,A six years' darling of a pigmy size!
13713,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies,"
13714,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses,"
13715,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,With light upon him from his father's eyes!
13716,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,"
13717,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Some fragment from his dream of human life,"
13718,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Shaped by himself with newly-learnéd art;
13719,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"A wedding or a festival,"
13720,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,A mourning or a funeral;
13721,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"And this hath now his heart,"
13722,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And unto this he frames his song:
13723,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Then will he fit his tongue
13724,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"To dialogues of business, love, or strife;"
13725,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,But it will not be long
13726,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Ere this be thrown aside,"
13727,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,And with new joy and pride
13728,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The little actor cons another part;
13729,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Filling from time to time his ""humorous stage"""
13730,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,"
13731,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,That life brings with her in her equipage;
13732,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,As if his whole vocation

13747,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,A presence which is not to be put by;
13748,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Thou little child, yet glorious in the might"

13752,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
13753,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,"

13758,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Is something that doth live,"
13759,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,That nature yet remembers
13760,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,What was so fugitive!
13761,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The thought of our past years in me doth breed
13762,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Perpetual benediction: not indeed
13763,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"For that which is most worthy to be blest,"
13764,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Delight and liberty, the simple creed"
13765,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Of childhood, whether busy or at rest,"
13766,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:
13767,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,--Not for these I raise
13768,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,The song of thanks and praise;
13769,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,But for those obstinate questionings
13770,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Of sense and outward things,"
13771,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Fallings from us, vanishings,"
13772,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Blank misgivings of a creature
13773,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Moving about in worlds not realised,"
13774,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"High instincts, before which our mortal nature"
13775,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:
13776,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"But for those first affections,"
13777,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Those shadowy recollections,"
13778,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Which, be they what they may,"
13779,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,"

13787,EARLY CHILDHOOD.,"Nor all that is at enmity with joy,"

14326,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,The remark quoted in the note to No. 47 applies equally to these truly
14327,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,"wonderful verses, which, like ""Lycidas,"" may be regarded as a test of"
14328,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,any reader's insight into the most poetical aspects of Poetry. The
14329,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,general differences between them are vast: but in imaginative intensity
14330,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,Marvell and Shelley are closely related. This poem is printed as a
14331,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,translation in Marvell's works: but the original Latin is obviously his
14332,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,"own. The most striking verses in it, here quoted as the book is rare,"
14333,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,answer more or less to stanzas 2 and 6:
14334,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,
14335,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,"Alma Quies, teneo te! et te, germana Quietis, Simplicitas! vos ergo diu"

14344,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,"astonishing power, that these, the earliest pure Descriptive Lyrics in"
14345,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,"our language, should still remain the best in a style which so many"
14346,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,great poets have since attempted. The Bright and the Thoughtful aspects
14347,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,of Nature are their subjects: but each is preceded by a mythological
14348,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,introduction in a mixed Classical and Italian manner. The meaning of the
14349,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,"first is that Gaiety is the child of Nature; of the second, that"

14794,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,The leading idea of this beautiful description of a day's landscape in
14795,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,Italy is expressed with an obscurity not unfrequent with its author. It

14802,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,_Sun-girt City_: It is difficult not to believe that the correct reading
14803,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,is _Seagirt_. Many of Shelley's poems appear to have been printed in
14804,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,England during his residence abroad: others were printed from his
14805,PALGRAVE'S NOTES.,manuscripts after his death. Hence probably the text of no English Poet
