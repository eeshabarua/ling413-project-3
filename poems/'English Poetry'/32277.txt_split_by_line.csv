65,DISSIPATED.,That Bacchus cause her many tears.
66,DISSIPATED.,"The husband oft to harlots stray,"
67,DISSIPATED.,Whene'er he bears a sovereign's sway;
68,DISSIPATED.,"And by his aid the thoughtless youth,"
69,DISSIPATED.,Is led from virtues paths and truth:

217,CASTLE HILL.,And thinks Mark-Lane will have a small supply;
218,CASTLE HILL.,"Contrary winds will keep the vessels back,"
219,CASTLE HILL.,And in his purchase he will not be slack.
220,CASTLE HILL.,"Only one thought now harass much his brain,"
221,CASTLE HILL.,He fears to Banker's shop to go again;

237,CASTLE HILL.,And that the banker mortgages retain;
238,CASTLE HILL.,"On each estate the gaudy thing has bought,"
239,CASTLE HILL.,And that in real wealth not worth a groat.
240,CASTLE HILL.,"Still he goes on till on a sudden stray,"
241,CASTLE HILL.,Away awhile and cant the farmer pay;
242,CASTLE HILL.,"Flies to his factor in the time of need,"
243,CASTLE HILL.,For an advance but do not there succeed.
244,CASTLE HILL.,"Some characters like those I do know well,"
245,CASTLE HILL.,They can't last long they cut so great a swell;
246,CASTLE HILL.,"Oft do we see a very handsome coach,"
247,CASTLE HILL.,"A merchant sport, and meriting reproach;"
248,CASTLE HILL.,"Because full well he knows his books must show,"
