14,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,This etext contains only characters from the Latin-1 set. The original
15,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,work contained a few phrases of Greek text. These are represented here
16,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"as Beta-code transliterations in brackets, e.g. [Greek: Liakyra]."
17,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
18,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,The original text used a few other characters not found in the Latin-1
19,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"set. These have been represented using bracket notation: [=a], [=i] [=e]"
20,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,represent those letters with a macron. A few instances of superscript
21,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"letters are indicated by carets, as in ""Concluded, Canto 2^d, Smyrna,"
22,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"March 28^th^."""

24,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"An important feature of this edition is its copious notes, which are of"
25,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"three types. Notes indexed with a number and a letter, for example"
26,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"[4.B.], are end-notes provided by Byron or, following Canto IV, by J. C."
27,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,Hobhouse. These notes follow each Canto.
28,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,
29,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,Poems and end-notes have footnotes. Footnotes indexed with lowercase
30,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"letters (e.g. [c], [bf]) show variant forms of Byron's text from"
31,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,manuscripts and other sources. Footnotes indexed with arabic numbers
32,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"(e.g. [17], [221]) are informational. In the original, footnotes are"
33,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"printed at the foot of the page on which they are referenced, and their"
34,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"indices start over on each page. In this etext, footnotes have been"
35,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"collected at the end of each section, and have been numbered"
36,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,consecutively throughout the book. Within each block of footnotes are
37,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"numbers in braces, e.g. {321}. These represent the page number on which"
38,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,the following notes originally appeared. To find a note that was
39,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"originally printed on page 27, search for {27}."

41,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,Text in footnotes and end-notes in square brackets is the work of Editor
42,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,E. H. Coleridge. Note text not in brackets is by Byron or Hobhouse. In
43,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,"certain notes on variant text, the editor showed deleted text struck"
44,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES,through with lines. The struck-through words are noted here with braces

82,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,
83,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,The text of the present edition of _Childe Harold's Pilgrimage_ is based
84,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"upon a collation of volume i. of the Library Edition, 1855, with the"
85,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"following MSS.: (i.) the original MS. of the First and Second Cantos, in"
86,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,Byron's handwriting [MS. M.]; (ii.) a transcript of the First and Second
87,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"Cantos, in the handwriting of R. C. Dallas [D.]; (iii.) a transcript of"
88,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"the Third Canto, in the handwriting of Clara Jane Clairmont [C.]; (iv.)"
89,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"a collection of ""scraps,"" forming a first draft of the Third Canto, in"
90,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,Byron's handwriting [MS.]; (v.) a fair copy of the first draft of the
91,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"Fourth Canto, together with the MS. of the additional stanzas, in"
92,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,Byron's handwriting. [MS. M.]; (vi.) a second fair copy of the Fourth
93,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"Canto, as completed, in Byron's handwriting [D.]."
94,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,
95,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,The text of the First and Second Cantos has also been collated with the
96,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"text of the First Edition of the First and Second Cantos (quarto,"
97,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,1812); the text of the Third and of the Fourth Cantos with the texts of
98,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,the First Editions of 1816 and 1818 respectively; and the text of the
99,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,entire poem with that issued in the collected editions of 1831 and 1832.
100,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,
101,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,Considerations of space have determined the position and arrangement of
102,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,the notes.
103,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,
104,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"Byron's notes to the First, Second, and Third Cantos, and Hobhouse's"
105,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"notes to the Fourth Canto are printed, according to precedent, at the"
106,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,end of each canto.
107,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,
108,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,Editorial notes are placed in square brackets. Notes illustrative of the
109,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,text are printed immediately below the variants. Notes illustrative of
110,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,Byron's notes or footnotes are appended to the originals or printed as
111,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,footnotes. Byron's own notes to the Fourth Canto are printed as
112,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,footnotes to the text.
113,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,
114,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"Hobhouse's ""Historical Notes"" are reprinted without addition or comment;"
115,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"but the numerous and intricate references to classical, historical, and"
116,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"archæological authorities have been carefully verified, and in many"
117,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,instances rewritten.
118,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,
119,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"In compiling the Introductions, the additional notes, and footnotes, I"
120,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,have endeavoured to supply the reader with a compendious manual of
121,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,reference. With the subject-matter of large portions of the three
122,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,distinct poems which make up the five hundred stanzas of _Childe
123,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"Harold's Pilgrimage_ every one is more or less familiar, but details"
124,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,and particulars are out of the immediate reach of even the most
125,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,cultivated readers.
126,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,
127,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,The poem may be dealt with in two ways. It may be regarded as a
128,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,repertory or treasury of brilliant passages for selection and quotation;
129,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"or it may be read continuously, and with some attention to the style and"
130,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,message of the author. It is in the belief that _Childe Harold_ should
131,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"be read continuously, and that it gains by the closest study, reassuming"
132,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"its original freshness and splendour, that the text as well as Byron's"
133,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,own notes have been somewhat minutely annotated.
134,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,
135,PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.,"In the selection and composition of the notes I have, in addition to"

191,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,1810. The dates were duly recorded on the MS.; but in none of the
192,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,letters which Byron wrote to his mother and his friends from the East
193,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,does he mention or allude to the composition or existence of such a
194,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"work. In one letter, however, to his mother (January 14, 1811,"
195,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"_Letters_, 1898, i. 308), he informs her that he has MSS. in his"

197,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"executors ""think proper to publish them;"" but for himself, he has ""done"

202,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"R. C. Dallas, who had superintended the publication of _English Bards,"
203,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"and Scotch Reviewers_, that he has ""an imitation of the _Ars Poetica_ of"
204,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Horace ready for Cawthorne."" Byron landed in England on July 2, and on"
205,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"the 15th Dallas ""had the pleasure of shaking hands with him at Reddish's"

207,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"1824, p. 103). There was a crowd of visitors, says Dallas, and no time"
208,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,for conversation; but the _Imitation_ was placed in his hands. He took
209,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"it home, read it, and was disappointed. Disparagement was out of the"
210,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,question; but the next morning at breakfast Dallas ventured to express
211,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,some surprise that he had written nothing else. An admission or
212,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"confession followed that ""he had occasionally written short poems,"
213,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"besides a great many stanzas in Spenser's measure, relative to the"
214,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"countries he had visited."" ""They are not,"" he added, ""worth troubling"
215,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"you with, but you shall have them all with you if you like."" ""So,"" says"
216,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Dallas, ""came I by _Childe Harold_. He took it from a small trunk, with"
217,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"a number of verses."""
218,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,
219,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Dallas was ""delighted,"" and on the evening of the same day (July"
220,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"16)--before, let us hope, and not after, he had consulted his ""Ionian"
221,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"friend,"" Walter Rodwell Wright (see _Recollections_, p. 151, and _Diary_"
222,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"of H.C. Robinson, 1872, i. 17)--he despatched a letter of enthusiastic"
223,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"approval, which gratified Byron, but did not convince him of the"
224,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"extraordinary merit of his work, or of its certainty of success. It was,"
225,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"however, agreed that the MS. should be left with Dallas, that he should"
226,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,arrange for its publication and hold the copyright. Dallas would have
227,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"entrusted the poem to Cawthorne, who had published _English Bards, and"
228,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Scotch Reviewers,_ and with whom, as Byron's intermediary, he was in"
229,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,communication; but Byron objected on the ground that the firm did not
230,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"""stand high enough in the trade,"" and Longmans, who had been offered but"
231,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"had declined the _English Bards_, were in no case to be approached. An"
232,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"application to Miller, of Albemarle Street, came to nothing, because"
233,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,Miller was Lord Elgin's bookseller and publisher (he had just brought
234,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"out the _Memorandum on Lord Elgin's Pursuits in Greece_), and _Childe"
235,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Harold_ denounced and reviled Lord Elgin. But Murray, of Fleet Street,"
236,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"who had already expressed a wish to publish for Lord Byron, was willing"
237,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,to take the matter into consideration. On the first of August Byron lost
238,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"his mother, on the third his friend Matthews was drowned in the Cam, and"
239,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,for some weeks he could devote neither time nor thought to the fortunes
240,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"of his poem; but Dallas had bestirred himself, and on the eighteenth was"
241,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"able to report that he had ""seen Murray again,"" and that Murray was"
242,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,anxious that Byron's name should appear on the title-page.
243,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,
244,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,To this request Byron somewhat reluctantly acceded (August 21); and a
245,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,few days later (August 25) he informs Dallas that he has sent him
246,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"""exordiums, annotations, etc., for the forthcoming quarto,"" and has"
247,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"written to Murray, urging him on no account to show the MS. to Juvenal,"
248,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"that is, Gifford. But Gifford, as a matter of course, had been already"
249,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"consulted, had read the First Canto, and had advised Murray to publish"
250,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"the poem. Byron was, or pretended to be, furious; but the solid fact"
251,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"that Gifford had commended his work acted like a charm, and his fury"
252,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"subsided. On the fifth of September (_Letters_, 1898, ii. 24, note) he"
253,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"received from Murray the first proof, and by December 14 ""the Pilgrimage"
254,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"was concluded,"" and all but the preface had been printed and seen"
255,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,through the press.
256,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,
257,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"The original draft of the poem, which Byron took out of ""the little"
258,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"trunk"" and gave to Dallas, had undergone considerable alterations and"
259,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,modifications before this date. Both Dallas and Murray took exception to
260,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"certain stanzas which, on personal, or patriotic, or religious"
261,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"considerations, were provocative and objectionable. They were"
262,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"apprehensive, not only for the sale of the book, but for the reputation"
263,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"of its author. Byron fought his ground inch by inch, but finally"
264,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,assented to a compromise. He was willing to cut out three stanzas on the
265,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Convention of Cintra, which had ceased to be a burning question, and"
266,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"four more stanzas at the end of the First Canto, which reflected on the"
267,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Duke of Wellington, Lord Holland, and other persons of less note. A"
268,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"stanza on Beckford in the First Canto, and two stanzas in the second on"
269,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Lord Elgin, Thomas Hope, and the ""Dilettanti crew,"" were also omitted."
270,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Stanza ix. of the Second Canto, on the immortality of the soul, was"
271,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"recast, and ""sure and certain"" hopelessness exchanged for a pious, if"
272,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"hypothetical, aspiration. But with regard to the general tenor of his"
273,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"politics and metaphysics, Byron stood firm, and awaited the issue."
274,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,
275,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,There were additions as well as omissions. The first stanza of the First

300,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,altogether. Not only were nine poems added to the twenty already

302,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"in the autumn of 1812, was prefixed to the First Canto, and ten"
303,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,additional stanzas were inserted towards the end of the Second Canto.

306,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"to Ianthe was the outcome of a visit to Eywood, and his devotion to"
307,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Ianthe's mother, Lady Oxford; but the new stanzas were probably written"
308,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"in 1810. In a letter to Dallas, September 7, 1811 (_Letters_, 1898, ii."
309,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"28), he writes, ""I had projected an additional canto when I was in the"
310,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Troad and Constantinople, and if I saw them again, it would go on."" This"
311,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"seems to imply that a beginning had been made. In a poem, a hitherto"

331,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"association removed, before we can see clearly. But there is one"
332,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,characteristic feature of _Childe Harold_ which association and
333,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,familiarity have been powerless to veil or confuse--originality of
334,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"design. ""By what accident,"" asks the Quarterly Reviewer (George Agar"
335,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Ellis), ""has it happened that no other English poet before Lord Byron"
336,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,has thought fit to employ his talents on a subject so well suited to
337,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"their display?"" The question can only be answered by the assertion that"
338,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"it was the accident of genius which inspired the poet with a ""new song."""
339,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"_Childe Harold's Pilgrimage_ had no progenitors, and, with the exception"
340,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"of some feeble and forgotten imitations, it has had no descendants. The"

342,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Campbell's _Gertrude of Wyoming_, as well as by older models; the"
343,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"language, the metaphors, often appropriated and sometimes stolen from"
344,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"the Bible, from Shakespeare, from the classics; the sentiments and"
345,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"reflections coeval with reflection and sentiment, wear a familiar hue;"
346,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"but the poem itself, a pilgrimage to scenes and cities of renown, a song"
347,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"of travel, a rhythmical diorama, was Byron's own handiwork--not an"
348,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"inheritance, but a creation."

353,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"monastic dome""? Is Childe Harold Byron masquerading in disguise, or is"
354,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"he intended to be a fictitious personage, who, half unconsciously,"
355,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,reveals the author's personality? Byron deals with the question in a
356,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"letter to Dallas (October 31): ""I by no means intend to identify myself"
357,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"with _Harold_, but to _deny_ all connection with him. If in parts I may"
358,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"be thought to have drawn from myself, believe me it is but in parts, and"
359,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"I shall not own even to that."" He adds, with evident sincerity, ""I would"
360,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"not be such a fellow as I have made my hero for all the world."" Again,"
361,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"in the preface, ""Harold is the child of imagination."" This pronouncement"
362,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,was not the whole truth; but it is truer than it seems. He was well
363,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,aware that Byron had sate for the portrait of Childe Harold. He had
364,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"begun by calling his hero Childe Burun, and the few particulars which he"
365,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"gives of Childe Burun's past were particulars, in the main exact"
366,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"particulars, of Byron's own history. He had no motive for concealment,"
367,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"for, so little did he know himself, he imagined that he was not writing"
368,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"for publication, that he had done with authorship. Even when the mood"
369,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"had passed, it was the imitation of the _Ars Poetica_, not _Childe"
370,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"Harold_, which he was eager to publish; and when _Childe Harold_ had"
371,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"been offered to and accepted by a publisher, he desired and proposed"
372,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,that it should appear anonymously. He had not as yet come to the pass of
373,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"displaying ""the pageant of his bleeding heart"" before the eyes of the"
374,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,multitude. But though he shrank from the obvious and inevitable
375,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"conclusion that Childe Harold was Byron in disguise, and idly"
376,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"""disclaimed"" all connection, it was true that he had intended to draw a"
377,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"fictitious character, a being whom he may have feared he might one day"
378,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"become, but whom he did not recognize as himself. He was not sated, he"
379,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"was not cheerless, he was not unamiable. He was all a-quiver with youth"
380,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,and enthusiasm and the joy of great living. He had left behind him
381,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"friends whom he knew were not ""the flatterers of the festal"
382,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"hour""--friends whom he returned to mourn and nobly celebrate. Byron was"
383,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"not Harold, but Harold was an ideal Byron, the creature and avenger of"
384,INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF _CHILDE HAROLD_.,"his pride, which haunted and pursued its presumptuous creator to the"

881,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.]
882,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],
883,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],
884,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"The following poem was written, for the most part, amidst the scenes"
885,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],which it attempts[b] to describe. It was begun in Albania; and the parts
886,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],relative to Spain and Portugal were composed from the author's
887,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],observations in those countries. Thus much it may be necessary to state
888,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],for the correctness of the descriptions. The scenes attempted to be
889,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"sketched are in Spain, Portugal, Epirus, Acarnania and Greece. There,"
890,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"for the present, the poem stops: its reception will determine whether"
891,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],the author may venture to conduct his readers to the capital of the
892,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"East, through Ionia and Phrygia: these two cantos are merely"
893,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],experimental.
894,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],
895,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],A fictitious character is introduced for the sake of giving some
896,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"connection to the piece; which, however, makes no pretension to"
897,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"regularity. It has been suggested to me by friends, on whose opinions I"
898,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"set a high value,[c]--that in this fictitious character, ""Childe"
899,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"Harold,"" I may incur the suspicion of having intended some real"
900,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"personage: this I beg leave, once for all, to disclaim--Harold is the"
901,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"child of imagination, for the purpose I have stated."
902,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],
903,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"In some very trivial particulars, and those merely local, there might"
904,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"be grounds for such a notion;[d] but in the main points, I should hope,"
905,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],none whatever.[e]
906,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],
907,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"It is almost superfluous to mention that the appellation ""Childe,""[2] as"
908,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"""Childe Waters,"" ""Childe Childers,"" etc., is used as more consonant with"
909,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"the old structure of versification which I have adopted. The ""Good"
910,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"Night"" in the beginning of the first Canto, was suggested by Lord"
911,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"Maxwell's ""Good Night""[3] in the _Border Minstrelsy_, edited by Mr."
912,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],Scott.
913,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],
914,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],With the different poems[4] which have been published on Spanish
915,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"subjects, there may be found some slight coincidence[f] in the first"
916,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"part, which treats of the Peninsula, but it can only be casual; as, with"
917,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"the exception of a few concluding stanzas, the whole of the poem was"
918,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],written in the Levant.
919,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],
920,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"The stanza of Spenser, according to one of our most successful poets,"
921,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],admits of every variety. Dr. Beattie makes the following observation:--
922,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],
923,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"""Not long ago I began a poem in the style and stanza of Spenser, in"
924,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"which I propose to give full scope to my inclination, and be either"
925,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"droll or pathetic, descriptive or sentimental, tender or satirical, as"
926,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"the humour strikes me; for, if I mistake not, the measure which I have"
927,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"adopted admits equally of all these kinds of composition.""[5]"
928,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"Strengthened in my opinion by such authority, and by the example of some"
929,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"in the highest order of Italian poets, I shall make no apology for"
930,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],attempts at similar variations in the following composition;[g]
931,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"satisfied that, if they are unsuccessful, their failure must be in the"
932,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"execution, rather than in the design sanctioned by the practice of"
933,[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.],"Ariosto, Thomson, and Beattie."

939,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.
940,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,
941,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,I have now waited till almost all our periodical journals have
942,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,distributed their usual portion of criticism. To the justice of the
943,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,generality of their criticisms I have nothing to object; it would ill
944,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"become me to quarrel with their very slight degree of censure, when,"
945,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"perhaps, if they had been less kind they had been more candid."
946,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"Returning, therefore, to all and each my best thanks for their"
947,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"liberality, on one point alone I shall venture an observation. Amongst"
948,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,the many objections justly urged to the very indifferent character of
949,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"the ""vagrant Childe"" (whom, notwithstanding many hints to the contrary,"
950,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"I still maintain to be a fictitious personage), it has been stated,"
951,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"that, besides the anachronism, he is very _unknightly_, as the times of"
952,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"the Knights were times of Love, Honour, and so forth.[6] Now it so"
953,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"happens that the good old times, when ""l'amour du bon vieux tems,"
954,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"l'amour antique,"" flourished, were the most profligate of all possible"
955,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,centuries. Those who have any doubts on this subject may consult
956,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"Sainte-Palaye, _passim_, and more particularly vol. ii. p. 69.[7] The"
957,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,vows of chivalry were no better kept than any other vows whatsoever; and
958,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"the songs of the Troubadours were not more decent, and certainly were"
959,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"much less refined, than those of Ovid. The ""Cours d'Amour, parlemens"
960,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"d'amour, ou de courtoisie et de gentilesse"" had much more of love than"
961,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,of courtesy or gentleness. See Rolland[8] on the same subject with
962,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,Sainte-Palaye.
963,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,
964,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,Whatever other objection may be urged to that most unamiable personage
965,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"Childe Harold, he was so far perfectly knightly in his attributes--""No"
966,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"waiter, but a knight templar.""[9] By the by, I fear that Sir Tristrem"
967,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"and Sir Lancelot were no better than they should be, although very"
968,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"poetical personages and true knights, ""sans peur,"" though not ""sans"
969,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"réproche."" If the story of the institution of the ""Garter"" be not a"
970,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"fable, the knights of that order have for several centuries borne the"
971,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"badge of a Countess of Salisbury, of indifferent memory. So much for"
972,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"chivalry. Burke need not have regretted that its days are over, though"
973,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,Marie-Antoinette was quite as chaste as most of those in whose honour
974,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"lances were shivered, and knights unhorsed.[10]"
975,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,
976,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"Before the days of Bayard, and down to those of Sir Joseph Banks[11]"
977,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,(the most chaste and celebrated of ancient and modern times) few
978,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,exceptions will be found to this statement; and I fear a little
979,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,investigation will teach us not to regret these monstrous mummeries of
980,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,the middle ages.
981,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,
982,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"I now leave ""Childe Harold"" to live his day such as he is; it had been"
983,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"more agreeable, and certainly more easy, to have drawn an amiable"
984,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"character. It had been easy to varnish over his faults, to make him do"
985,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"more and express less, but he never was intended as an example, further"
986,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"than to show, that early perversion of mind and morals leads to satiety"
987,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"of past pleasures and disappointment in new ones, and that even the"
988,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"beauties of nature and the stimulus of travel (except ambition, the most"
989,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"powerful of all excitements) are lost on a soul so constituted, or"
990,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"rather misdirected. Had I proceeded with the Poem, this character would"
991,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,have deepened as he drew to the close; for the outline which I once
992,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"meant to fill up for him was, with some exceptions, the sketch of a"
993,ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.,"modern Timon,[12] perhaps a poetical Zeluco.[13]"

4075,CANTO I.,"""Viv[=a] el Rey Fernando!"" Long live King Ferdinand! is the chorus of"

4077,CANTO I.,"the old King Charles, the Queen, and the Prince of Peace. I have heard"
4078,CANTO I.,"many of them: some of the airs are beautiful. Godoy, the _Principe de la"
4079,CANTO I.,"Paz_, of an ancient but decayed family, was born at Badajoz, on the"
4080,CANTO I.,"frontiers of Portugal, and was originally in the ranks of the Spanish"
4081,CANTO I.,"guards; till his person attracted the queen's eyes, and raised him to"
4082,CANTO I.,"the dukedom of Alcudia, etc., etc. It is to this man that the Spaniards"
4083,CANTO I.,universally impute the ruin of their country.
4084,CANTO I.,
4085,CANTO I.,"[Manuel de Godoy (1767-1851) received the title of _Principe de la Paz_,"
4086,CANTO I.,"Prince of the Peace, in 1795, after the Treaty of Basle, which ceded"
4087,CANTO I.,"more than half St. Domingo to France. His tenure of power, as prime"
4088,CANTO I.,"minister and director of the king's policy, coincided with the downfall"
4089,CANTO I.,"of Spanish power, and before the commencement of the Peninsular War he"
4090,CANTO I.,was associated in the minds of the people with national corruption and
4091,CANTO I.,"national degradation. He was, moreover, directly instrumental in the"
4092,CANTO I.,"betrayal of Spain to France. By the Treaty of Fontainebleau, October 27,"
4093,CANTO I.,"1807, Portugal was to be divided between the King of Etruria and Godoy"
4094,CANTO I.,"as Prince of the Algarves, Portuguese America was to fall to the King of"
4095,CANTO I.,"Spain, and to bring this about Napoleon's troops were to enter Spain and"
4096,CANTO I.,march directly to Lisbon. The sole outcome of the treaty was the
4097,CANTO I.,occupation of Portugal and subsequent invasion of Spain. Before Byron
4098,CANTO I.,"had begun his pilgrimage, Godoy's public career had come to an end."
4099,CANTO I.,"During the insurrection at Aranjuez, March 17-19, 1808, when Charles IV."
4100,CANTO I.,"abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinand VII., Godoy was only preserved"
4101,CANTO I.,from the fury of the populace by a timely imprisonment. In the following
4102,CANTO I.,"May, by which time Ferdinand himself was a prisoner in France, he was"
4103,CANTO I.,"released at the instance of Murat, and ordered to accompany Charles to"
4104,CANTO I.,"Bayonne, for the express purpose of cajoling his master into a second"
4105,CANTO I.,abdication in favour of Napoleon. The remainder of his long life was
4106,CANTO I.,"passed, first at Rome, and afterwards at Paris, in exile and dependence."
4107,CANTO I.,"The execration of Godoy, ""who was really a mild, good-natured man,"""

4365,I.[113],"Come, blue-eyed Maid of Heaven!--but Thou, alas!"
4366,I.[113],Didst never yet one mortal song inspire--
4367,I.[113],"Goddess of Wisdom! here thy temple was,"
4368,I.[113],"And is, despite of War and wasting fire,[1.B.]"
4369,I.[113],"And years, that bade thy worship to expire:"
4370,I.[113],"But worse than steel, and flame, and ages slow,[2.B.]"
4371,I.[113],Is the dread sceptre and dominion dire
4372,I.[113],Of men who never felt the sacred glow
4373,I.[113],That thoughts of thee and thine on polished breasts bestow.

4377,II.,"Ancient of days! august Athena! where,[do]"
4378,II.,Where are thy men of might? thy grand in soul?
4379,II.,Gone--glimmering through the dream of things that were:[dp]
4380,II.,"First in the race that led to Glory's goal,"
4381,II.,"They won, and passed away--is this the whole?"
4382,II.,"A schoolboy's tale, the wonder of an hour!"
4383,II.,The Warrior's weapon and the Sophist's stole[114]

4387,III.,III.
4388,III.,
4389,III.,"Son of the Morning, rise! approach you here!"
4390,III.,Come--but molest not yon defenceless Urn:
4391,III.,Look on this spot--a Nation's sepulchre!
4392,III.,"Abode of Gods, whose shrines no longer burn.[dr]"
4393,III.,Even Gods must yield--Religions take their turn:
4394,III.,'Twas Jove's--'tis Mahomet's--and other Creeds
4395,III.,"Will rise with other years, till Man shall learn"
4396,III.,"Vainly his incense soars, his victim bleeds;"

4405,IV.,"Thou know'st not, reck'st not to what region, so[115]"
4406,IV.,"On Earth no more, but mingled with the skies?"
4407,IV.,Still wilt thou dream on future Joy and Woe?[dt]
4408,IV.,Regard and weigh yon dust before it flies:
4409,IV.,That little urn saith more than thousand Homilies.
4410,IV.,
4411,V.,V.
4412,V.,
4413,V.,Or burst the vanished Hero's lofty mound;
4414,V.,Far on the solitary shore he sleeps:[3.B.]
4415,V.,"He fell, and falling nations mourned around;"
4416,V.,"But now not one of saddening thousands weeps,"
4417,V.,Nor warlike worshipper his vigil keeps
4418,V.,"Where demi-gods appeared, as records tell.[du][116]"
4419,V.,Remove yon skull from out the scattered heaps:
4420,V.,Is that a Temple where a God may dwell?
4421,V.,Why ev'n the Worm at last disdains her shattered cell!

4438,VII.,"""All that we know is, nothing can be known."""
4439,VII.,Why should we shrink from what we cannot shun?
4440,VII.,"Each hath its pang, but feeble sufferers groan"
4441,VII.,With brain-born dreams of Evil all their own.
4442,VII.,Pursue what Chance or Fate proclaimeth best;
4443,VII.,Peace waits us on the shores of Acheron:
4444,VII.,"There no forced banquet claims the sated guest,"
4445,VII.,But Silence spreads the couch of ever welcome Rest.

4451,VIII.[119],To shame the Doctrine of the Sadducee
4452,VIII.[119],"And Sophists, madly vain of dubious lore;"
4453,VIII.[119],How sweet it were in concert to adore
4454,VIII.[119],With those who made our mortal labours light!
4455,VIII.[119],To hear each voice we feared to hear no more!

4463,IX.[120],"Twined with my heart, and can I deem thee dead"
4464,IX.[120],When busy Memory flashes on my brain?
4465,IX.[120],"Well--I will dream that we may meet again,"
4466,IX.[120],And woo the vision to my vacant breast:
4467,IX.[120],"If aught of young Remembrance then remain,"
4468,IX.[120],"Be as it may Futurity's behest,[dw]"
4469,IX.[120],For me 'twere bliss enough to know thy spirit blest!

4472,X.,
4473,X.,"Here let me sit upon this massy stone,"
4474,X.,The marble column's yet unshaken base;
4475,X.,"Here, son of Saturn! was thy favourite throne:[4.B.]"
4476,X.,Mightiest of many such! Hence let me trace
4477,X.,The latent grandeur of thy dwelling-place.
4478,X.,It may not be: nor ev'n can Fancy's eye
4479,X.,Restore what Time hath laboured to deface.

4488,XI.,"The last, the worst, dull spoiler, who was he?[dx]"
4489,XI.,"Blush, Caledonia! such thy son could be!"
4490,XI.,England! I joy no child he was of thine:
4491,XI.,Thy free-born men should spare what once was free;
4492,XI.,"Yet they could violate each saddening shrine,"
4493,XI.,And hear these altars o'er the long-reluctant brine.[5.B.]
4494,XI.,
4495,XII.,XII.
4496,XII.,
4497,XII.,"But most the modern Pict's ignoble boast,[dy][122]"

4499,XII.,"Cold as the crags upon his native coast,"
4500,XII.,"His mind as barren and his heart as hard,"
4501,XII.,"Is he whose head conceived, whose hand prepared."
4502,XII.,Aught to displace Athenæ's poor remains:
4503,XII.,"Her Sons too weak the sacred shrine to guard,"
4504,XII.,"Yet felt some portion of their Mother's pains,[7.B.]"

4510,XIII.,Albion was happy in Athena's tears?
4511,XIII.,"Though in thy name the slaves her bosom wrung,"
4512,XIII.,Tell not the deed to blushing Europe's ears;
4513,XIII.,"The Ocean Queen, the free Britannia, bears"
4514,XIII.,The last poor plunder from a bleeding land:
4515,XIII.,"Yes, she, whose generous aid her name endears,"
4516,XIII.,"Tore down those remnants with a Harpy's hand,"

4536,XV.,"Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed"
4537,XV.,"By British hands, which it had best behoved[ec]"
4538,XV.,To guard those relics ne'er to be restored:--
4539,XV.,"Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,"
4540,XV.,"And once again thy hapless bosom gored,"
4541,XV.,And snatched thy shrinking Gods to Northern climes abhorred![123]

4543,XVI.,XVI.
4544,XVI.,
4545,XVI.,But where is Harold? shall I then forget
4546,XVI.,To urge the gloomy Wanderer o'er the wave?
4547,XVI.,Little recked he of all that Men regret;
4548,XVI.,No loved-one now in feigned lament could rave;[124]
4549,XVI.,"No friend the parting hand extended gave,"
4550,XVI.,Ere the cold Stranger passed to other climes:
4551,XVI.,Hard is his heart whom charms may not enslave;

4596,XX.,That lagging barks may make their lazy way.[125]
4597,XX.,"Ah! grievance sore, and listless dull delay,"

6876,CANTO II.,"many of his countrymen--for, lost as they are, they yet feel on this"
6877,CANTO II.,occasion--thus may Lord Elgin boast of having ruined Athens. An Italian
6878,CANTO II.,"painter of the first eminence, named Lusieri[205], is the agent of"
6879,CANTO II.,"devastation; and like the Greek _finder_[206] of Verres in Sicily, who"
6880,CANTO II.,"followed the same profession, he has proved the able instrument of"
6881,CANTO II.,"plunder. Between this artist and the French Consul Fauvel[207], who"
6882,CANTO II.,"wishes to rescue the remains for his own government, there is now a"
6883,CANTO II.,"violent dispute concerning a car employed in their conveyance, the wheel"
6884,CANTO II.,of which--I wish they were both broken upon it!--has been locked up by
6885,CANTO II.,"the Consul, and Lusieri has laid his complaint before the Waywode. Lord"
6886,CANTO II.,Elgin has been extremely happy in his choice of Signer Lusieri. During a
6887,CANTO II.,"residence of ten years in Athens, he never had the curiosity to proceed"
6888,CANTO II.,"as far as Sunium (now Cape Colonna),[208] till he accompanied us in our"
6889,CANTO II.,"second excursion. However, his works, as far as they go, are most"
6890,CANTO II.,beautiful: but they are almost all unfinished. While he and his patrons
6891,CANTO II.,"confine themselves to tasting medals, appreciating cameos, sketching"
6892,CANTO II.,"columns, and cheapening gems, their little absurdities are as harmless"
6893,CANTO II.,"as insect or fox-hunting, maiden-speechifying, barouche-driving, or any"
6894,CANTO II.,such pastime; but when they carry away three or four shiploads of the
6895,CANTO II.,most valuable and massy relics that time and barbarism have left to the
6896,CANTO II.,"most injured and most celebrated of cities: when they destroy, in a vain"
6897,CANTO II.,"attempt to tear down, those works which have been the admiration of"
6898,CANTO II.,"ages, I know no motive which can excuse, no name which can designate,"
6899,CANTO II.,the perpetrators of this dastardly devastation. It was not the least of
6900,CANTO II.,"the crimes laid to the charge of Verres, that he had plundered Sicily,"
6901,CANTO II.,in the manner since imitated at Athens. The most unblushing impudence
6902,CANTO II.,could hardly go farther than to affix the name of its plunderer to the
6903,CANTO II.,walls of the Acropolis; while the wanton and useless defacement of the
6904,CANTO II.,"whole range of the basso-relievos, in one compartment of the temple,"
6905,CANTO II.,will never permit that name to be pronounced by an observer without

7008,CANTO II.,before we visited any other part of the Ottoman dominions; and with the

7010,CANTO II.,other Englishmen have ever advanced beyond the capital into the
7011,CANTO II.,"interior, as that gentleman very lately assured me. Ali Pacha was at"
7012,CANTO II.,"that time (October, 1809) carrying on war against Ibrahim Pacha, whom he"
7013,CANTO II.,"had driven to Berat, a strong fortress, which he was then besieging: on"
7014,CANTO II.,"our arrival at Joannina we were invited to Tepaleni, his highness's"
7015,CANTO II.,"birthplace, and favourite Serai, only one day's distance from Berat; at"
7016,CANTO II.,this juncture the Vizier had made it his headquarters. After some stay
7017,CANTO II.,"in the capital, we accordingly followed; but though furnished with every"
7018,CANTO II.,"accommodation, and escorted by one of the Vizier's secretaries, we were"
7019,CANTO II.,"nine days (on account of the rains) in accomplishing a journey which, on"
7020,CANTO II.,"our return, barely occupied four. On our route we passed two cities,"
7021,CANTO II.,"Argyrocastro and Libochabo, apparently little inferior to Yanina in"
7022,CANTO II.,size; and no pencil or pen can ever do justice to the scenery in the
7023,CANTO II.,"vicinity of Zitza and Delvinachi, the frontier village of Epirus and"
7024,CANTO II.,Albania Proper.
7025,CANTO II.,
7026,CANTO II.,"On Albania and its inhabitants I am unwilling to descant, because this"
7027,CANTO II.,"will be done so much better by my fellow-traveller, in a work which may"
7028,CANTO II.,"probably precede this in publication, that I as little wish to follow as"
7029,CANTO II.,I would to anticipate him.[214] But some few observations are necessary
7030,CANTO II.,"to the text. The Arnaouts, or Albanese, struck me forcibly by their"
7031,CANTO II.,"resemblance to the Highlanders of Scotland, in dress, figure, and manner"
7032,CANTO II.,"of living. Their very mountains seemed Caledonian, with a kinder"
7033,CANTO II.,"climate. The kilt, though white; the spare, active form; their dialect,"
7034,CANTO II.,"Celtic in its sound; and their hardy habits, all carried me back to"
7035,CANTO II.,Morven. No nation are so detested and dreaded by their neighbours as the
7036,CANTO II.,"Albanese; the Greeks hardly regard them as Christians, or the Turks as"
7037,CANTO II.,"Moslems; and in fact they are a mixture of both, and sometimes neither."
7038,CANTO II.,"Their habits are predatory--all are armed; and the red-shawled Arnaouts,"
7039,CANTO II.,"the Montenegrins, Chimariots, and Gegdes, are treacherous;[215] the"
7040,CANTO II.,"others differ somewhat in garb, and essentially in character. As far as"
7041,CANTO II.,"my own experience goes, I can speak favourably. I was attended by two,"
7042,CANTO II.,"an Infidel and a Mussulman, to Constantinople and every other part of"
7043,CANTO II.,"Turkey which came within my observation; and more faithful in peril, or"
7044,CANTO II.,"indefatigable in service, are rarely to be found. The Infidel was named"
7045,CANTO II.,"Basilius; the Moslem, Dervish Tahiri; the former a man of middle age,"
7046,CANTO II.,and the latter about my own. Basili was strictly charged by Ali Pacha in
7047,CANTO II.,person to attend us; and Dervish was one of fifty who accompanied us
7048,CANTO II.,"through the forests of Acarnania to the banks of Achelous, and onward to"
7049,CANTO II.,"Messalonghi in Ætolia. There I took him into my own service, and never"
7050,CANTO II.,had occasion to repent it till the moment of my departure.
7051,CANTO II.,
7052,CANTO II.,"When, in 1810, after the departure of my friend Mr. Hobhouse for"
7053,CANTO II.,"England, I was seized with a severe fever in the Morea, these men saved"
7054,CANTO II.,"my life by frightening away my physician, whose throat they threatened"
7055,CANTO II.,to cut if I was not cured within a given time. To this consolatory
7056,CANTO II.,"assurance of posthumous retribution, and a resolute refusal of Dr."
7057,CANTO II.,"Romanelli's prescriptions, I attributed my recovery.[gg] I had left my"
7058,CANTO II.,last remaining English servant at Athens; my dragoman was as ill as
7059,CANTO II.,"myself, and my poor Arnaouts nursed me with an attention which would"
7060,CANTO II.,have done honour to civilization. They had a variety of adventures; for
7061,CANTO II.,"the Moslem, Dervish, being a remarkably handsome man, was always"
7062,CANTO II.,squabbling with the husbands of Athens; insomuch that four of the
7063,CANTO II.,principal Turks paid me a visit of remonstrance at the Convent on the
7064,CANTO II.,subject of his having taken a woman from the bath--whom he had lawfully
7065,CANTO II.,"bought, however--a thing quite contrary to etiquette. Basili also was"
7066,CANTO II.,"extremely gallant amongst his own persuasion, and had the greatest"
7067,CANTO II.,"veneration for the church, mixed with the highest contempt of churchmen,"
7068,CANTO II.,whom he cuffed upon occasion in a most heterodox manner. Yet he never
7069,CANTO II.,passed a church without crossing himself; and I remember the risk he
7070,CANTO II.,"ran in entering St. Sophia, in Stambol, because it had once been a place"
7071,CANTO II.,of his worship. On remonstrating with him on his inconsistent
7072,CANTO II.,"proceedings, he invariably answered, ""Our church is holy, our priests"
7073,CANTO II.,"are thieves:"" and then he crossed himself as usual, and boxed the ears"
7074,CANTO II.,"of the first ""papas"" who refused to assist in any required operation, as"
7075,CANTO II.,was always found to be necessary where a priest had any influence with
7076,CANTO II.,"the Cogia Bashi[216] of his village. Indeed, a more abandoned race of"
7077,CANTO II.,miscreants cannot exist than the lower orders of the Greek clergy.
7078,CANTO II.,
7079,CANTO II.,"When preparations were made for my return, my Albanians were summoned to"
7080,CANTO II.,receive their pay. Basili took his with an awkward show of regret at my
7081,CANTO II.,"intended departure, and marched away to his quarters with his bag of"
7082,CANTO II.,"piastres. I sent for Dervish, but for some time he was not to be found;"
7083,CANTO II.,"at last he entered, just as Signor Logotheti,[217] father to the"
7084,CANTO II.,"ci-devant Anglo-consul of Athens, and some other of my Greek"
7085,CANTO II.,"acquaintances, paid me a visit. Dervish took the money in his hand, but"
7086,CANTO II.,"on a sudden dashed it to the ground; and clasping his hands, which he"
7087,CANTO II.,"raised to his forehead, rushed out of the room weeping bitterly. From"
7088,CANTO II.,"that moment to the hour of my embarkation, he continued his"
7089,CANTO II.,"lamentations, and all our efforts to console him only produced this"
7090,CANTO II.,"answer, ""[Greek: M'apheinei]"", ""He leaves me."" Signer Logotheti, who"
7091,CANTO II.,never wept before for anything less than the loss of a para (about the
7092,CANTO II.,"fourth of a farthing), melted; the padre of the convent, my attendants,"
7093,CANTO II.,"my visitors--and I verily believe that even Sterne's ""foolish fat"
7094,CANTO II.,"scullion"" would have left her ""fish-kettle"" to sympathize with the"
7095,CANTO II.,unaffected and unexpected sorrow of this barbarian.[218]
7096,CANTO II.,
7097,CANTO II.,"For my own part, when I remembered that, a short time before my"
7098,CANTO II.,"departure from England, a noble and most intimate associate had excused"
7099,CANTO II.,himself from taking leave of me because he had to attend a female
7100,CANTO II.,"relation ""to a milliner's,""[219] I felt no less surprised than"
7101,CANTO II.,humiliated by the present occurrence and the past recollection. That
7102,CANTO II.,Dervish would leave me with some regret was to be expected; when master
7103,CANTO II.,and man have been scrambling over the mountains of a dozen provinces
7104,CANTO II.,"together, they are unwilling to separate; but his present feelings,"
7105,CANTO II.,"contrasted with his native ferocity, improved my opinion of the human"
7106,CANTO II.,heart. I believe this almost feudal fidelity is frequent amongst them.
7107,CANTO II.,"One day, on our journey over Parnassus, an Englishman in my service gave"
7108,CANTO II.,"him a push in some dispute about the baggage, which he unluckily mistook"
7109,CANTO II.,"for a blow; he spoke not, but sat down leaning his head upon his hands."
7110,CANTO II.,"Foreseeing the consequences, we endeavoured to explain away the affront,"
7111,CANTO II.,"which produced the following answer:--""I _have been_ a robber; I _am_ a"
7112,CANTO II.,"soldier; no captain ever struck me; _you_ are my master, I have eaten"
7113,CANTO II.,"your bread, but by _that_ bread! (a usual oath) had it been otherwise, I"
7114,CANTO II.,"would have stabbed the dog, your servant, and gone to the mountains."" So"
7115,CANTO II.,"the affair ended, but from that day forward he never thoroughly forgave"
7116,CANTO II.,the thoughtless fellow who insulted him. Dervish excelled in the dance
7117,CANTO II.,"of his country, conjectured to be a remnant of the ancient Pyrrhic: be"
7118,CANTO II.,"that as it may, it is manly, and requires wonderful agility. It is very"
7119,CANTO II.,"distinct from the stupid Romaika,[220] the dull round-about of the"
7120,CANTO II.,"Greeks, of which our Athenian party had so many specimens."
7121,CANTO II.,
7122,CANTO II.,The Albanians in general (I do not mean the cultivators of the earth in
7123,CANTO II.,"the provinces, who have also that appellation, but the mountaineers)"
7124,CANTO II.,have a fine cast of countenance; and the most beautiful women I ever
7125,CANTO II.,"beheld, in stature and in features, we saw _levelling_ the _road_ broken"
7126,CANTO II.,down by the torrents between Delvinachi and Libochabo. Their manner of
7127,CANTO II.,walking is truly theatrical; but this strut is probably the effect of
7128,CANTO II.,"the capote, or cloak, depending from one shoulder. Their long hair"
7129,CANTO II.,"reminds you of the Spartans, and their courage in desultory warfare is"
7130,CANTO II.,"unquestionable. Though they have some cavalry amongst the Gegdes, I"
7131,CANTO II.,"never saw a good Arnaout horseman; my own preferred the English saddles,"
7132,CANTO II.,"which, however, they could never keep. But on foot they are not to be"

7800,II.,"all that time has left them; viz. their pedigree, of which they are the"

7802,II.,"while to publish together, and compare, the works of Messrs. Thornton"
7803,II.,"and De Pauw, Eton and Sonnini; paradox on one side, and prejudice on the"
7804,II.,other. Mr. Thornton conceives himself to have claims to public
7805,II.,confidence from a fourteen years' residence at Pera; perhaps he may on
7806,II.,"the subject of the Turks, but this can give him no more insight into the"
7807,II.,"real state of Greece and her inhabitants, than as many years spent in"
7808,II.,Wapping into that of the Western Highlands.

7811,II.,not oftener cross the Golden Horn than his brother merchants are
7812,II.,"accustomed to do, I should place no great reliance on his information. I"
7813,II.,actually heard one of these gentlemen boast of their little general
7814,II.,"intercourse with the city, and assert of himself, with an air of"
7815,II.,"triumph, that he had been but four times at Constantinople in as many"
7816,II.,years.
7817,II.,
7818,II.,"As to Mr. Thornton's voyages in the Black Sea with Greek vessels, they"
7819,II.,gave him the same idea of Greece as a cruise to Berwick in a Scotch
7820,II.,smack would of Johnny Groat's house. Upon what grounds then does he
7821,II.,arrogate the right of condemning by wholesale a body of men of whom he
7822,II.,"can know little? It is rather a curious circumstance that Mr. Thornton,"
7823,II.,who so lavishly dispraises Pouqueville on every occasion of mentioning
7824,II.,"the Turks, has yet recourse to him as authority on the Greeks, and terms"
7825,II.,"him an impartial observer. Now, Dr. Pouqueville is as little entitled to"
7826,II.,that appellation as Mr. Thornton to confer it on him.
7827,II.,
7828,II.,"The fact is, we are deplorably in want of information on the subject of"
7829,II.,"the Greeks, and in particular their literature; nor is there any"
7830,II.,"probability of our being better acquainted, till our intercourse becomes"
7831,II.,"more intimate, or their independence confirmed. The relations of"
7832,II.,passing travellers are as little to be depended on as the invectives of
7833,II.,"angry factors; but till something more can be attained, we must be"
7834,II.,content with the little to be acquired from similar sources.[240]
7835,II.,
7836,II.,"However defective these may be, they are preferable to the parodoxes of"
7837,II.,"men who have read superficially of the ancients, and seen nothing of the"
7838,II.,"moderns, such as De Pauw; who, when he asserts that the British breed of"
7839,II.,"horses is ruined by Newmarket, and that the Spartans[241] were cowards"
7840,II.,"in the field,[242] betrays an equal knowledge of English horses and"
7841,II.,"Spartan men. His ""philosophical observations"" have a much better claim"
7842,II.,"to the title of ""poetical."" It could not be expected that he who so"
7843,II.,liberally condemns some of the most celebrated institutions of the
7844,II.,"ancient, should have mercy on the modern Greeks; and it fortunately"
7845,II.,"happens, that the absurdity of his hypothesis on their forefathers"
7846,II.,refutes his sentence on themselves.
7847,II.,
7848,II.,"Let us trust, then, that, in spite of the prophecies of De Pauw, and the"

7882,III.[243],"displeasure, of the said Gail. To his exertions, literary and patriotic,"
7883,III.[243],great praise is undoubtedly due; but a part of that praise ought not to
7884,III.[243],be withheld from the two brothers Zosimado (merchants settled in

8990,VIII.,"He of the breast which fain no more would feel,[go]"
8991,VIII.,"Wrung with the wounds which kill not, but ne'er heal;"
8992,VIII.,"Yet Time, who changes all, had altered him"

9003,IX.,Still round him clung invisibly a chain
9004,IX.,"Which galled for ever, fettering though unseen,"
9005,IX.,"And heavy though it clanked not; worn with pain,"
9006,IX.,"Which pined although it spoke not, and grew keen,"

9015,X.,"That, if no joy, no sorrow lurked behind;"
9016,X.,"And he, as one, might 'midst the many stand"

12140,CANTO III.,not pronounced within walls. Demosthenes addressed the public and
12141,CANTO III.,popular assemblies. Cicero spoke in the forum. That this added to their
12142,CANTO III.,"effect on the mind of both orator and hearers, may be conceived from the"
12143,CANTO III.,"difference between what we read of the emotions then and there produced,"
12144,CANTO III.,and those we ourselves experience in the perusal in the closet. It is
12145,CANTO III.,"one thing to read the _Iliad_ at Sigæum and on the tumuli, or by the"
12146,CANTO III.,"springs with Mount Ida above, and the plain and rivers and Archipelago"
12147,CANTO III.,around you; and another to trim your taper over it in a snug
12148,CANTO III.,library--_this_ I know. Were the early and rapid progress of what is
12149,CANTO III.,called Methodism to be attributed to any cause beyond the enthusiasm
12150,CANTO III.,excited by its vehement faith and doctrines (the truth or error of which
12151,CANTO III.,"I presume neither to canvass nor to question), I should venture to"
12152,CANTO III.,"ascribe it to the practice of preaching in the _fields_, and the"
12153,CANTO III.,"unstudied and extemporaneous effusions of its teachers. The Mussulmans,"
12154,CANTO III.,"whose erroneous devotion (at least in the lower orders) is most sincere,"
12155,CANTO III.,"and therefore impressive, are accustomed to repeat their prescribed"
12156,CANTO III.,"orisons and prayers, wherever they may be, at the stated hours--of"
12157,CANTO III.,"course, frequently in the open air, kneeling upon a light mat (which"
12158,CANTO III.,they carry for the purpose of a bed or cushion as required); the
12159,CANTO III.,"ceremony lasts some minutes, during which they are totally absorbed, and"
12160,CANTO III.,only living in their supplication: nothing can disturb them. On me the
12161,CANTO III.,"simple and entire sincerity of these men, and the spirit which appeared"
12162,CANTO III.,"to be within and upon them, made a far greater impression than any"
12163,CANTO III.,"general rite which was ever performed in places of worship, of which I"
12164,CANTO III.,have seen those of almost every persuasion under the sun; including most
12165,CANTO III.,"of our own sectaries, and the Greek, the Catholic, the Armenian, the"
12166,CANTO III.,"Lutheran, the Jewish, and the Mahometan. Many of the negroes, of whom"
12167,CANTO III.,"there are numbers in the Turkish empire, are idolaters, and have free"
12168,CANTO III.,exercise of their belief and its rites; some of these I had a distant
12169,CANTO III.,"view of at Patras; and, from what I could make out of them, they"
12170,CANTO III.,"appeared to be of a truly Pagan description, and not very agreeable to a"

12225,CANTO III.,"[June 23-27], 1816, I made a voyage round the Lake of Geneva;[359] and,"
12226,CANTO III.,as far as my own observations have led me in a not uninterested nor
12227,CANTO III.,inattentive survey of all the scenes most celebrated by Rousseau in his
12228,CANTO III.,"_Héloïse_, I can safely say, that in this there is no exaggeration. It"
12229,CANTO III.,"would be difficult to see Clarens (with the scenes around it, Vevay,"
12230,CANTO III.,"Chillon, Bôveret, St. Gingo, Meillerie, Evian,[360] and the entrances of"
12231,CANTO III.,the Rhone) without being forcibly struck with its peculiar adaptation to
12232,CANTO III.,the persons and events with which it has been peopled. But this is not
12233,CANTO III.,"all; the feeling with which all around Clarens, and the opposite rocks"
12234,CANTO III.,"of Meillerie, is invested, is of a still higher and more comprehensive"
12235,CANTO III.,order than the mere sympathy with individual passion; it is a sense of
12236,CANTO III.,"the existence of love in its most extended and sublime capacity, and of"
12237,CANTO III.,our own participation of its good and of its glory: it is the great
12238,CANTO III.,"principle of the universe, which is there more condensed, but not less"
12239,CANTO III.,"manifested; and of which, though knowing ourselves a part, we lose our"
12240,CANTO III.,"individuality, and mingle in the beauty of the whole.--If Rousseau had"
12241,CANTO III.,"never written, nor lived, the same associations would not less have"
12242,CANTO III.,belonged to such scenes. He has added to the interest of his works by
12243,CANTO III.,their adoption; he has shown his sense of their beauty by the selection;
12244,CANTO III.,but they have done that for him which no human being could do for
12245,CANTO III.,them.--I had the fortune (good or evil as it might be) to sail from
12246,CANTO III.,Meillerie[361] (where we landed for some time) to St. Gingo during a
12247,CANTO III.,"lake storm, which added to the magnificence of all around, although"
12248,CANTO III.,"occasionally accompanied by danger to the boat, which was small and"
12249,CANTO III.,overloaded. It was over this very part of the lake that Rousseau has
12250,CANTO III.,driven the boat of St. Preux and Madame Wolmar to Meillerie for shelter
12251,CANTO III.,"during a tempest. On gaining the shore at St. Gingo, I found that the"
12252,CANTO III.,wind had been sufficiently strong to blow down some fine old chestnut
12253,CANTO III.,trees on the lower part of the mountains. On the opposite height of
12254,CANTO III.,Clarens is a château[362] [Château des Crêtes]. The hills are covered
12255,CANTO III.,"with vineyards, and interspersed with some small but beautiful woods;"
12256,CANTO III.,"one of these was named the ""Bosquet de Julie;"" and it is remarkable"
12257,CANTO III.,"that, though long ago cut down by the brutal selfishness of the monks of"
12258,CANTO III.,"St. Bernard (to whom the land appertained), that the ground might be"
12259,CANTO III.,enclosed into a vineyard for the miserable drones of an execrable
12260,CANTO III.,"superstition, the inhabitants of Clarens still point out the spot where"
12261,CANTO III.,"its trees stood, calling it by the name which consecrated and survived"
12262,CANTO III.,them. Rousseau has not been particularly fortunate in the preservation
12263,CANTO III.,"of the ""local habitations"" he has given to ""airy nothings."" The Prior of"
12264,CANTO III.,Great St. Bernard has cut down some of his woods for the sake of a few
12265,CANTO III.,"casks of wine, and Buonaparte has levelled part of the rocks of"

12491,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Byron had no sooner completed ""this fourth and ultimate canto,"" than he"
12492,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,began to throw off additional stanzas. His letters to Murray during the
12493,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,autumn of 1817 announce these successive lengthenings; but it is
12494,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,impossible to trace the exact order of their composition. On the 7th of
12495,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"August the canto stood at 130 stanzas, on the 21st at 133; on the 4th of"
12496,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"September at 144, on the 17th at 150; and by November 15 it had reached"
12497,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"167 stanzas. Of nineteen stanzas which were still to be added, six--on"
12498,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"the death of the Princess Charlotte (died November 6, 1817)--were"
12499,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"written at the beginning of December, and two stanzas (clxxvii.,"
12500,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,clxxviii.) were forwarded to Murray in the early spring of 1818.
12501,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,
12502,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,Of these additions the most notable are four stanzas on Venice

12515,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,
12516,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Some time during the month of December, 1817, Byron wrote out a fair"
12517,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"copy of the entire canto, numbering 184 stanzas _(MS. D.)_; and on"
12518,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"January 7, 1818, Hobhouse left Venice for England, with the ""whole of"
12519,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"the MSS.,"" viz. _Beppo_ (begun October, 1817), and the Fourth Canto of"
12520,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"_Childe Harold_, together with a work of his own, a volume of essays on"
12521,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Italian literature, the antiquities of Rome, etc., which he had put"
12522,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"together during his residence in Venice (July--December, 1817), and"
12523,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,proposed to publish as an appendix to _Childe Harold_. In his preface to
12524,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"_Historical Illustrations_, etc., 1818, Hobhouse explains that on his"
12525,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"return to England he considered that this ""appendix to the Canto would"
12526,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"be swelled to a disproportioned bulk,"" and that, under this impression,"
12527,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,he determined to divide his material into two parts. The result was that
12528,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"""such only of the notes as were more immediately connected with the"
12529,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"text"" were printed as ""Historical Notes to Canto the Fourth,"" and that"
12530,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"his longer dissertations were published in a separate volume, under his"
12531,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"own name, as _Historical Illustrations to the Fourth Canto of Childe"
12532,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Harold_. To these ""Historical Notes"" an interest attaches apart from any"
12533,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,consideration of their own worth and importance; but to understand the
12534,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"relation between the poem and the notes, it is necessary to retrace the"
12535,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,movements of the poet and his annotator.
12536,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,
12537,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Byron and Hobhouse left the Villa Diodati, October 5, 1816, crossed the"
12538,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Simplon, and made their way together, via Milan and Verona, to Venice."
12539,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Early in December the friends parted company. Byron remained at Venice,"
12540,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"and Hobhouse proceeded to Rome, and for the next four months devoted"
12541,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"himself to the study of Italian literature, in connection with"
12542,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"archæology and art. Byron testifies (September 14, 1817) that his"
12543,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"researches were ""indefatigable,"" that he had ""more real knowledge of"
12544,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,Rome and its environs than any Englishman who has been there since
12545,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Gibbon."" Hobhouse left Rome for Naples, May 21; returned to Rome, June"
12546,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"9; arrived at Terni, July 2; and early in July joined Byron on the"
12547,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Brenta, at La Mira. The latter half of the year (July--December, 1817)"
12548,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"was occupied in consulting ""the best authorities"" in the Ducal Library"
12549,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"at Venice, with a view to perfecting his researches, and giving them to"
12550,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,the world as an illustrative appendix to _Childe Harold_. It is certain
12551,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"that Byron had begun the fourth canto, and written some thirty or more"
12552,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"stanzas, before Hobhouse rejoined him at his villa of La Mira on the"
12553,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"banks of the Brenta, in July, 1817; and it would seem that, although he"
12554,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"had begun by saying ""that he was too short a time in Rome for it,"" he"
12555,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"speedily overcame his misgivings, and accomplished, as he believed, the"
12556,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"last ""fytte"" of his pilgrimage. The first draft was Byron's unaided"
12557,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"composition, but the ""additional stanzas"" were largely due to Hobhouse's"
12558,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"suggestions in the course of conversation, if not to his written"
12559,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"""researches."" Hobhouse himself made no secret of it. In his preface (p."
12560,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"5) to _Historical Illustrations_ he affirms that both ""illustrations"""
12561,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"and notes were ""for the most part written while the noble author was yet"
12562,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,employed in the composition of the poem. They were put into the hands of
12563,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Lord Byron much in the state in which they now appear;"" and, writing to"
12564,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Murray, December 7, 1817, he says, ""I must confess I feel an affection"
12565,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"for it [Canto IV.] more than ordinary, as part of it was begot as it"
12566,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,were under my own eyes; for although your poets are as shy as elephants
12567,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"and camels ... yet I have, not unfrequently, witnessed his lordship's"
12568,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"coupleting, and some of the stanzas owe their birth to our morning walk"
12569,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"or evening ride at La Mira."" Forty years later, in his revised and"
12570,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"enlarged ""Illustrations"" (_Italy: Remarks made in Several Visits from"
12571,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"the year 1816 to 1854_, by the Right Hon. Lord Broughton, G.C.B., 1859,"
12572,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"i. p. iv.), he reverts to this collaboration: ""When I rejoined Lord"
12573,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,Byron at La Mira ... I found him employed upon the Fourth Canto of
12574,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"_Childe Harold_, and, later in the autumn, he showed me the first sketch"
12575,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"of the poem. It was much shorter than it afterwards became, and it did"
12576,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,not remark on several objects which appeared to me peculiarly worthy of
12577,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"notice. I made a list of these objects, and in conversation with him"
12578,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,gave him reasons for the selection. The result was the poem as it now
12579,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"appears, and he then engaged me to write the notes."""
12580,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,
12581,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"As the ""delicate spirit"" of Shelley suffused the third canto of _Childe"
12582,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Harold_, so the fourth reveals the presence and co-operation of"
12583,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"Hobhouse. To his brother-poet he owed a fresh conception, perhaps a"
12584,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"fresh appreciation of nature; to his lifelong friend, a fresh enthusiasm"
12585,INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.,"for art, and a host of details, ""dry bones ... which he awakened into"

15885,D.],"detention, and that the famous cell or dungeon (""nine paces by six, and"
15886,D.],"about seven high"") was not ""the original place of the poet's"
15887,D.],"confinement."" It was, as Shelley says (see his letter to Peacock,"
15888,D.],"November 7, 1818), ""a very decent dungeon;"" but it was not Tasso's. The"
15889,D.],"setting of the story was admitted to be legendary, but the story itself,"
15890,D.],that a poet was shut up in a madhouse because a vindictive magnate
15891,D.],"resented his love of independence and impatience of courtly servitude,"
15892,D.],"was questioned, only to be reasserted as historical. The publication of"

15899,D.],"Tasso's intrigues with rival powers--the Medici at Florence, the papal"
15900,D.],"court, and the Holy Office at Bologna--aroused the alarm and suspicion"
15901,D.],"of the duke, whilst his general demeanour and his outbursts of violence"
15902,D.],"and temper compelled, rather than afforded, a pretext for his"
15903,D.],"confinement. Before his final and fatal return to Ferrara, he had been"
15904,D.],duly warned that he must submit to be treated as a person of disordered
15905,D.],"intellect, and that if he continued to throw out hints of designs upon"
15906,D.],"his life and of persecution in high places, he would be banished from"
15907,D.],"the ducal court and dominions. But return he would, and at an"
15908,D.],"inauspicious moment, when the duke was preoccupied with the ceremonies"
15909,D.],and festivities of a third marriage. No one attended to him or took heed
15910,D.],"of his arrival; and, to quote his own words, ""in a fit of madness"" he"
15911,D.],"broke out into execrations of the ducal court and family, and of the"
15912,D.],people of Ferrara. For the offence he was shut up in the Hospital of
15913,D.],"Sant' Anna, and for many months treated as an ordinary lunatic. Of the"
15914,D.],particulars of his treatment during these first eight months of his
15915,D.],"confinement, apart from Tasso's own letters, there is no evidence. The"
15916,D.],"accounts of the hospital are lost, and the _Libri di spesa_ (_R. Arch."

15921,D.],known that a certain measure of liberty and other indulgences were
15922,D.],"gradually accorded. There can, however, be little doubt that for many"
15923,D.],months his food was neglected and medical attendance withheld. His
15924,D.],"statement, that he was denied the rites of the Church, cannot be"
15925,D.],"gainsaid. He was regarded as a lunatic, and, as such, he would not be"
15926,D.],permitted either to make his confession or to communicate. Worse than
15927,D.],"all, there was the terrible solitude. ""E sovra tutto,"" he writes (May,"

18124,CANTO IV.,
18125,CANTO IV.,The communication between the ducal palace and the prisons of Venice is
18126,CANTO IV.,"by a gloomy bridge, or covered gallery, high above the water, and"
18127,CANTO IV.,divided by a stone wall into a passage and a cell. The state dungeons
18128,CANTO IV.,"called _pozzi_, or wells, were sunk in the thick walls of the palace:"
18129,CANTO IV.,"and the prisoner, when taken out to die, was conducted across the"
18130,CANTO IV.,"gallery to the other side, and being then led back into the other"
18131,CANTO IV.,"compartment, or cell, upon the bridge, was there strangled. The low"
18132,CANTO IV.,portal through which the criminal was taken into this cell is now walled
18133,CANTO IV.,"up; but the passage is still open, and is still known by the name of the"
18134,CANTO IV.,"""Bridge of Sighs."" The _pozzi_ are under the flooring of the chamber at"
18135,CANTO IV.,the foot of the bridge. They were formerly twelve; but on the first
18136,CANTO IV.,"arrival of the French, the Venetians hastily blocked or broke up the"
18137,CANTO IV.,"deeper of these dungeons. You may still, however descend by a trap-door,"
18138,CANTO IV.,"and crawl down through holes, half choked by rubbish, to the depth of"
18139,CANTO IV.,two stories below the first range. If you are in want of consolation for
18140,CANTO IV.,"the extinction of patrician power, perhaps you may find it there;"
18141,CANTO IV.,scarcely a ray of light glimmers into the narrow gallery which leads to
18142,CANTO IV.,"the cells, and the places of confinement themselves are totally dark. A"
18143,CANTO IV.,"small hole in the wall admitted the damp air of the passages, and"
18144,CANTO IV.,"served for the introduction of the prisoner's food. A wooden pallet,"
18145,CANTO IV.,"raised a foot from the ground, was the only furniture. The conductors"
18146,CANTO IV.,tell you that a light was not allowed. The cells are about five paces in
18147,CANTO IV.,"length, two and a half in width, and seven feet in height. They are"
18148,CANTO IV.,"directly beneath one another, and respiration is somewhat difficult in"
18149,CANTO IV.,the lower holes. Only one prisoner was found when the republicans
18150,CANTO IV.,"descended into these hideous recesses, and he is said to have been"
18151,CANTO IV.,confined sixteen years. But the inmates of the dungeons beneath had left
18152,CANTO IV.,"traces of their repentance, or of their despair, which are still"
18153,CANTO IV.,"visible, and may, perhaps, owe something to recent ingenuity. Some of"
18154,CANTO IV.,"the detained appear to have offended against, and others to have"
18155,CANTO IV.,"belonged to, the sacred body, not only from their signatures, but from"
18156,CANTO IV.,the churches and belfries which they have scratched upon the walls. The

18240,VENETIAN.,"On the 7th of last January, the author of _Childe Harold_, and another"
18241,VENETIAN.,"Englishman, the writer of this notice, rowed to the Lido with two"
18242,VENETIAN.,"singers, one of whom was a carpenter, and the other a gondolier. The"
18243,VENETIAN.,"former placed himself at the prow, the latter at the stern of the boat."
18244,VENETIAN.,"A little after leaving the quay of the Piazzetta, they began to sing,"
18245,VENETIAN.,and continued their exercise until we arrived at the island. They gave
18246,VENETIAN.,"us, amongst other essays, the death of Clorinda, and the palace of"
18247,VENETIAN.,Armida; and did not sing the Venetian but the Tuscan verses. The
18248,VENETIAN.,"carpenter, however, who was the cleverer of the two, and was frequently"
18249,VENETIAN.,"obliged to prompt his companion, told us that he could _translate_ the"
18250,VENETIAN.,"original. He added, that he could sing almost three hundred stanzas, but"
18251,VENETIAN.,"had not spirits (_morbin_ was the word he used) to learn any more, or to"
18252,VENETIAN.,sing what he already knew: a man must have idle time on his hands to
18253,VENETIAN.,"acquire, or to repeat, and, said the poor fellow, ""look at my clothes"
18254,VENETIAN.,"and at me; I am starving."" This speech was more affecting than his"
18255,VENETIAN.,"performance, which habit alone can make attractive. The recitative was"
18256,VENETIAN.,"shrill, screaming, and monotonous; and the gondolier behind assisted his"
18257,VENETIAN.,voice by holding his hand to one side of his mouth. The carpenter used a
18258,VENETIAN.,"quiet action, which he evidently endeavoured to restrain; but was too"
18259,VENETIAN.,much interested in his subject altogether to repress. From these men we
18260,VENETIAN.,"learnt that singing is not confined to the gondoliers, and that,"
18261,VENETIAN.,"although the chant is seldom, if ever, voluntary, there are still"
18262,VENETIAN.,several amongst the lower classes who are acquainted with a few stanzas.
18263,VENETIAN.,
18264,VENETIAN.,It does not appear that it is usual for the performers to row and sing
18265,VENETIAN.,at the same time. Although the verses of the _Jerusalem_ are no longer
18266,VENETIAN.,"casually heard, there is yet much music upon the Venetian canals; and"
18267,VENETIAN.,"upon holydays, those strangers who are not near or informed enough to"
18268,VENETIAN.,"distinguish the words, may fancy that many of the gondolas still resound"
18269,VENETIAN.,with the strains of Tasso. The writer of some remarks which appeared in
18270,VENETIAN.,"the _Curiosities of Literature_ must excuse his being twice quoted; for,"
18271,VENETIAN.,with the exception of some phrases a little too ambitious and
18272,VENETIAN.,"extravagant, he has furnished a very exact, as well as agreeable"
18273,VENETIAN.,description:--
18274,VENETIAN.,
18275,VENETIAN.,"""In Venice the gondoliers know by heart long passages from Ariosto and"
18276,VENETIAN.,"Tasso, and often chant them with a peculiar melody. But this talent"
18277,VENETIAN.,"seems at present on the decline:--at least, after taking some pains, I"
18278,VENETIAN.,could find no more than two persons who delivered to me in this way a
18279,VENETIAN.,"passage from Tasso. I must add, that the late Mr. Berry once chanted to"
18280,VENETIAN.,"me a passage in Tasso in the manner, as he assured me, of the"
18281,VENETIAN.,gondoliers.
18282,VENETIAN.,
18283,VENETIAN.,"""There are always two concerned, who alternately sing the strophes. We"
18284,VENETIAN.,"know the melody eventually by Rousseau, to whose songs it is printed; it"
18285,VENETIAN.,"has properly no melodious movement, and is a sort of medium between the"
18286,VENETIAN.,canto fermo and the canto figurato; it approaches to the former by
18287,VENETIAN.,"recitativical declamation, and to the latter by passages and course, by"
18288,VENETIAN.,which one syllable is detained and embellished.
18289,VENETIAN.,
18290,VENETIAN.,"""I entered a gondola by moonlight; one singer placed himself forwards"
18291,VENETIAN.,"and the other aft, and thus proceeded to St. Georgio. One began the"
18292,VENETIAN.,"song: when he had ended his strophe, the other took up the lay, and so"
18293,VENETIAN.,"continued the song alternately. Throughout the whole of it, the same"
18294,VENETIAN.,"notes invariably returned; but, according to the subject-matter of the"
18295,VENETIAN.,"strophe, they laid a greater or a smaller stress, sometimes on one, and"
18296,VENETIAN.,"sometimes on another note, and indeed changed the enunciation of the"
18297,VENETIAN.,whole strophe as the object of the poem altered.
18298,VENETIAN.,
18299,VENETIAN.,"""On the whole, however, the sounds were hoarse and screaming: they"
18300,VENETIAN.,"seemed, in the manner of all rude uncivilised men, to make the"
18301,VENETIAN.,excellency of their singing in the force of their voice. One seemed
18302,VENETIAN.,desirous of conquering the other by the strength of his lungs; and so
18303,VENETIAN.,far from receiving delight from this scene (shut up as I was in the box
18304,VENETIAN.,"of the gondola), I found myself in a very unpleasant situation."
18305,VENETIAN.,
18306,VENETIAN.,"""My companion, to whom I communicated this circumstance, being very"
18307,VENETIAN.,"desirous to keep up the credit of his countrymen, assured me that the"
18308,VENETIAN.,singing was very delightful when heard at a distance. Accordingly we got
18309,VENETIAN.,"out upon the shore, leaving one of the singers in the gondola, while the"
18310,VENETIAN.,other went to the distance of some hundred paces. They now began to sing
18311,VENETIAN.,"against one another, and I kept walking up and down between them both,"
18312,VENETIAN.,so as always to leave him who was to begin his part. I frequently stood
18313,VENETIAN.,still and hearkened to the one and to the other.
18314,VENETIAN.,
18315,VENETIAN.,"""Here the scene was properly introduced. The strong declamatory, and, as"
18316,VENETIAN.,"it were, shrieking sound, met the ear from far, and called forth the"
18317,VENETIAN.,"attention; the quickly succeeding transitions, which necessarily"
18318,VENETIAN.,"required to be sung in a lower tone, seemed like plaintive strains"
18319,VENETIAN.,"succeeding the vociferations of emotion or of pain. The other, who"
18320,VENETIAN.,"listened attentively, immediately began where the former left off,"
18321,VENETIAN.,"answering him in milder or more vehement notes, according as the purport"
18322,VENETIAN.,"of the strophe required. The sleepy canals, the lofty buildings, the"
18323,VENETIAN.,"splendour of the moon, the deep shadows of the few gondolas that moved"
18324,VENETIAN.,"like spirits hither and thither, increased the striking peculiarity of"
18325,VENETIAN.,"the scene; and, amidst all these circumstances, it was easy to confess"
18326,VENETIAN.,the character of this wonderful harmony.
18327,VENETIAN.,
18328,VENETIAN.,"""It suits perfectly well with an idle, solitary mariner, lying at length"
18329,VENETIAN.,"in his vessel at rest on one of these canals, waiting for his company,"
18330,VENETIAN.,"or for a fare, the tiresomeness of which situation is somewhat"
18331,VENETIAN.,alleviated by the songs and poetical stories he has in memory. He often
18332,VENETIAN.,"raises his voice as loud as he can, which extends itself to a vast"
18333,VENETIAN.,"distance over the tranquil mirror; and as all is still around, he is, as"
18334,VENETIAN.,"it were, in a solitude in the midst of a large and populous town. Here"
18335,VENETIAN.,"is no rattling of carriages, no noise of foot passengers; a silent"
18336,VENETIAN.,"gondola glides now and then by him, of which the splashings of the oars"
18337,VENETIAN.,are scarcely to be heard.
18338,VENETIAN.,
18339,VENETIAN.,"""At a distance he hears another, perhaps utterly unknown to him. Melody"
18340,VENETIAN.,and verse immediately attach the two strangers; he becomes the
18341,VENETIAN.,"responsive echo to the former, and exerts himself to be heard as he had"
18342,VENETIAN.,heard the other. By a tacit convention they alternate verse for verse;
18343,VENETIAN.,"though the song should last the whole night through, they entertain"
18344,VENETIAN.,themselves without fatigue: the hearers who are passing between the two
18345,VENETIAN.,take part in the amusement.
18346,VENETIAN.,
18347,VENETIAN.,"""This vocal performance sounds best at a great distance, and is then"
18348,VENETIAN.,"inexpressibly charming, as it only fulfills its design in the sentiment"
18349,VENETIAN.,"of remoteness. It is plaintive, but not dismal in its sound, and at"
18350,VENETIAN.,"times it is scarcely possible to refrain from tears. My companion, who"
18351,VENETIAN.,"otherwise was not a very delicately organised person, said quite"
18352,VENETIAN.,"unexpectedly: E singolare come quel canto intenerisce, e molto più"
18353,VENETIAN.,quando lo cantano meglio.
18354,VENETIAN.,
18355,VENETIAN.,"""I was told that the women of Libo, the long row of islands that divides"
18356,VENETIAN.,"the Adriatic from the Lagoons,[555] particularly the women of the"
18357,VENETIAN.,"extreme districts of Malamocca and Palestrina, sing in like manner the"
18358,VENETIAN.,works of Tasso to these and similar tunes.
18359,VENETIAN.,
18360,VENETIAN.,"""They have the custom, when their husbands are fishing out at sea, to"
18361,VENETIAN.,"sit along the shore in the evenings and vociferate these songs, and"
18362,VENETIAN.,"continue to do so with great violence, till each of them can distinguish"
18363,VENETIAN.,"the responses of her own husband at a distance.""[556]"
18364,VENETIAN.,
18365,VENETIAN.,"The love of music and of poetry distinguishes all classes of Venetians,"
18366,VENETIAN.,even amongst the tuneful sons of Italy. The city itself can occasionally
18367,VENETIAN.,furnish respectable audiences for two and even three opera-houses at a
18368,VENETIAN.,time; and there are few events in private life that do not call forth a
18369,VENETIAN.,printed and circulated sonnet. Does a physician or a lawyer take his
18370,VENETIAN.,"degree, or a clergyman preach his maiden sermon, has a surgeon performed"
18371,VENETIAN.,"an operation, would a harlequin announce his departure or his benefit,"
18372,VENETIAN.,"are you to be congratulated on a marriage, or a birth, or a lawsuit, the"
18373,VENETIAN.,"Muses are invoked to furnish the same number of syllables, and the"
18374,VENETIAN.,individual triumphs blaze abroad in virgin white or party-coloured
18375,VENETIAN.,placards on half the corners of the capital. The last curtsy of a
18376,VENETIAN.,"favourite ""prima donna"" brings down a shower of these poetical tributes"
18377,VENETIAN.,"from those upper regions, from which, in our theatres, nothing but"
18378,VENETIAN.,cupids and snowstorms are accustomed to descend. There is a poetry in
18379,VENETIAN.,"the very life of a Venetian, which, in its common course, is varied with"
18380,VENETIAN.,"those surprises and changes so recommendable in fiction, but so"
18381,VENETIAN.,different from the sober monotony of northern existence; amusements are
18382,VENETIAN.,"raised into duties, duties are softened into amusements, and every"
18383,VENETIAN.,object being considered as equally making a part of the business of
18384,VENETIAN.,"life, is announced and performed with the same earnest indifference and"
18385,VENETIAN.,gay assiduity. The Venetian gazette constantly closes its columns with
18386,VENETIAN.,the following triple advertisement:--
18387,VENETIAN.,

18398,VENETIAN.,When it is recollected what the Catholics believe their consecrated

18411,VENETIAN.,"whence they set out, and are, as before, half hidden under the porch"
18412,VENETIAN.,"window of St. Mark's Church. Their history, after a desperate struggle,"
18413,VENETIAN.,has been satisfactorily explored. The decisions and doubts of Erizzo and
18414,VENETIAN.,"Zanetti, and lastly, of the Count Leopold Cicognara, would have given"
18415,VENETIAN.,"them a Roman extraction, and a pedigree not more ancient than the reign"
18416,VENETIAN.,of Nero. But M. de Schlegel stepped in to teach the Venetians the value
18417,VENETIAN.,"of their own treasures; and a Greek vindicated, at last and for ever,"
18418,VENETIAN.,the pretension of his countrymen to this noble production[557]. M.
18419,VENETIAN.,"Mustoxidi has not been left without a reply; but, as yet, he has"
18420,VENETIAN.,received no answer. It should seem that the horses are irrevocably
18421,VENETIAN.,"Chian, and were transferred to Constantinople by Theodosius. Lapidary"
18422,VENETIAN.,"writing is a favourite play of the Italians, and has conferred"
18423,VENETIAN.,reputation on more than one of their literary characters. One of the
18424,VENETIAN.,best specimens of Bodoni's typography is a respectable volume of
18425,VENETIAN.,"inscriptions, all written by his friend Pacciaudi. Several were prepared"
18426,VENETIAN.,"for the recovered horses. It is to be hoped the best was not selected,"

18440,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,prudent to have avoided all allusions to either robbery. An apostolic
18441,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"prince should, perhaps, have objected to affixing over the principal"

18455,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Cisalpine dominions, the bloody struggles of four-and-twenty years were"
18456,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,happily brought to a close in the city of Venice. The articles of a
18457,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,treaty had been previously agreed upon between Pope Alexander III. and
18458,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Barbarossa; and the former having received a safe-conduct, had already"
18459,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"arrived at Venice from Ferrara, in company with the ambassadors of the"
18460,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,King of Sicily and the consuls of the Lombard League. There still
18461,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"remained, however, many points to adjust, and for several days the peace"
18462,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"was believed to be impracticable. At this juncture, it was suddenly"
18463,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"reported that the Emperor had arrived at Chioza, a town fifteen miles"
18464,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"from the capital. The Venetians rose tumultuously, and insisted upon"
18465,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"immediately conducting him to the city. The Lombards took the alarm, and"
18466,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,departed towards Treviso. The Pope himself was apprehensive of some
18467,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"disaster if Frederic should suddenly advance upon him, but was reassured"
18468,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"by the prudence and address of Sebastian Ziani, the Doge. Several"
18469,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"embassies passed between Chioza and the capital, until, at last, the"
18470,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Emperor, relaxing somewhat of his pretensions, ""laid aside his leonine"
18471,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"ferocity, and put on the mildness of the lamb.""[558]"
18472,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,
18473,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"On Saturday, the 23rd of July, in the year 1177, six Venetian galleys"
18474,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"transferred Frederic, in great pomp, from Chioza to the island of Lido,"
18475,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"a mile from Venice. Early the next morning, the Pope, accompanied by the"
18476,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Sicilian ambassadors, and by the envoys of Lombardy, whom he had"
18477,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"recalled from the main land, together with a great concourse of people,"
18478,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"repaired from the patriarchal palace to St. Mark's Church, and solemnly"
18479,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,absolved the Emperor and his partisans from the excommunication
18480,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"pronounced against him. The Chancellor of the Empire, on the part of his"
18481,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"master, renounced the anti-popes and their schismatic adherents."
18482,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Immediately the Doge, with a great suite both of the clergy and laity,"
18483,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"got on board the galleys, and waiting on Frederic, rowed him in mighty"
18484,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,state from the Lido to the capital. The Emperor descended from the
18485,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"galley at the quay of the Piazzetta. The Doge, the patriarch, his"
18486,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"bishops and clergy, and the people of Venice with their crosses and"
18487,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"their standards, marched in solemn procession before him to the church"
18488,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of St. Mark. Alexander was seated before the vestibule of the basilica,"
18489,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"attended by his bishops and cardinals, by the patriarch of Aquileja, by"
18490,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the archbishops and bishops of Lombardy, all of them in state, and"
18491,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"clothed in their church robes. Frederic approached--""moved by the Holy"
18492,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Spirit, venerating the Almighty in the person of Alexander, laying aside"
18493,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"his imperial dignity, and throwing off his mantle, he prostrated himself"
18494,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"at full length at the feet of the Pope. Alexander, with tears in his"
18495,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"eyes, raised him benignantly from the ground, kissed him, blessed him;"
18496,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"and immediately the Germans of the train sang with a loud voice, 'We"
18497,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"praise thee, O Lord.' The Emperor then taking the Pope by the right"
18498,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"hand, led him to the church, and having received his benediction,"
18499,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"returned to the ducal palace.""[559] The ceremony of humiliation was"
18500,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"repeated the next day. The Pope himself, at the request of Frederic,"
18501,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,said mass at St. Mark's. The Emperor again laid aside his imperial
18502,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"mantle, and taking a wand in his hand, officiated as _verger_, driving"
18503,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the laity from the choir, and preceding the pontiff to the altar."
18504,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Alexander, after reciting the gospel, preached to the people. The"
18505,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Emperor put himself close to the pulpit in the attitude of listening;
18506,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"and the pontiff, touched by this mark of his attention (for he knew that"
18507,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Frederic did not understand a word he said), commanded the patriarch of"

18510,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Pope's feet, and, mass being over, led him by the hand to his white"

18530,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,eighty-five years of age. When he commanded the Venetians at the taking
18531,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of Constantinople, he was consequently ninety-seven years old. At this"
18532,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,age he annexed the fourth and a half of the whole empire of

18561,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Francesco da Carrara, Signor of Padua, the Venetians were reduced to the"
18562,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,utmost despair. An embassy was sent to the conquerors with a blank sheet
18563,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of paper, praying them to prescribe what terms they pleased, and leave"
18564,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,to Venice only her independence. The Prince of Padua was inclined to
18565,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"listen to these proposals; but the Genoese, who, after the victory at"
18566,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Pola, had shouted, ""To Venice! to Venice! and long live St. George!"""
18567,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"determined to annihilate their rival; and Peter Doria, their"
18568,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"commander-in-chief, returned this answer to the suppliants: ""On God's"
18569,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"faith, gentlemen of Venice, ye shall have no peace from the Signer of"
18570,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Padua, nor from our commune of Genoa, until we have first put a rein"

18575,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"will not have them: take them back; for in a few days hence, I shall"

18578,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Malamocco, within five miles of the capital; but their own danger, and"
18579,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the pride of their enemies, gave courage to the Venetians, who made"
18580,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"prodigious efforts, and many individual sacrifices, all of them"
18581,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,carefully recorded by their historians. Vettor Pisani was put at the
18582,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"head of thirty-four galleys. The Genoese broke up from Malamocco, and"
18583,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"retired to Chioza in October; but they again threatened Venice, which"
18584,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"was reduced to extremities. At this time, the 1st of January, 1380,"
18585,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"arrived Carlo Zeno, who had been cruising on the Genoese coast with"
18586,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,fourteen galleys. The Venetians were now strong enough to besiege the
18587,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Genoese. Doria was killed on the 22nd of January, by a stone bullet, one"
18588,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"hundred and ninety-five pounds' weight, discharged from a bombard called"
18589,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,the Trevisan. Chioza was then closely invested; five thousand
18590,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"auxiliaries, among whom were some English condottieri, commanded by one"
18591,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Captain Ceccho, joined the Venetians. The Genoese, in their turn, prayed"
18592,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"for conditions, but none were granted, until, at last, they surrendered"
18593,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"at discretion; and, on the 24th of June, 1380, the Doge Contarini made"
18594,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"his triumphal entry into Chioza. Four thousand prisoners, nineteen"
18595,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"galleys, many smaller vessels and barks, with all the ammunition and"
18596,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"arms, and outfit of the expedition, fell into the hands of the"
18597,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"conquerors, who, had it not been for the inexorable answer of Doria,"
18598,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,would have gladly reduced their dominion to the city of Venice. An
18599,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,account of these transactions is found in a work called _The War of

18610,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"two years ago [1816], it was no more than about one hundred and three"
18611,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,thousand; and it diminishes daily. The commerce and the official
18612,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"employments, which were to be the unexhausted source of Venetian"
18613,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"grandeur, have both expired.[565] Most of the patrician mansions are"
18614,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"deserted, and would gradually disappear, had not the Government, alarmed"
18615,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"by the demolition of seventy-two during the last two years, expressly"
18616,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,forbidden this sad resource of poverty. Many remnants of the Venetian
18617,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"nobility are now scattered, and confounded with the wealthier Jews upon"
18618,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the banks of the Brenta, whose Palladian palaces have sunk, or are"
18619,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"sinking, in the general decay. Of the ""gentiluomo Veneto,"" the name is"
18620,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"still known, and that is all. He is but the shadow of his former self,"
18621,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,but he is polite and kind. It surely may be pardoned to him if he is
18622,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"querulous. Whatever may have been the vices of the republic, and"
18623,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,although the natural term of its existence may be thought by foreigners
18624,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"to have arrived in the due course of mortality, only one sentiment can"
18625,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,be expected from the Venetians themselves. At no time were the subjects
18626,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,of the republic so unanimous in their resolution to rally round the
18627,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"standard of St. Mark, as when it was for the last time unfurled; and the"
18628,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,cowardice and the treachery of the few patricians who recommended the
18629,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"fatal neutrality, were confined to the persons of the traitors"
18630,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,themselves. The present race cannot be thought to regret the loss of
18631,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"their aristocratical forms, and too despotic government; they think only"
18632,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"on their vanished independence. They pine away at the remembrance, and"
18633,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,on this subject suspend for a moment their gay good humour. Venice may
18634,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"be said, in the words of the Scripture, ""to die daily;"" and so general"
18635,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"and so apparent is the decline, as to become painful to a stranger, not"
18636,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"reconciled to the sight of a whole nation expiring, as it were, before"
18637,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"his eyes. So artificial a creation, having lost that principle which"
18638,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"called it into life and supported its existence, must fall to pieces at"
18639,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"once, and sink more rapidly than it rose. The abhorrence of slavery,"
18640,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"which drove the Venetians to the sea, has, since their disaster, forced"
18641,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"them to the land, where they may be at least overlooked amongst the"
18642,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"crowd of dependents, and not present the humiliating spectacle of a"
18643,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"whole nation loaded with recent chains. Their liveliness, their"
18644,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"affability, and that happy indifference which constitution alone can"
18645,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"give (for philosophy aspires to it in vain), have not sunk under"
18646,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,circumstances; but many peculiarities of costume and manner have by
18647,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"degrees been lost; and the nobles, with a pride common to all Italians"
18648,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"who have been masters, have not been persuaded to parade their"
18649,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,insignificance. That splendour which was a proof and a portion of their
18650,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"power, they would not degrade into the trappings of their subjection."
18651,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,They retired from the space which they had occupied in the eyes of their
18652,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,fellow citizens; their continuance in which would have been a symptom of
18653,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"acquiescence, and an insult to those who suffered by the common"
18654,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"misfortune. Those who remained in the degraded capital, might be said"
18655,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"rather to haunt the scenes of their departed power, than to live in"
18656,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"them. The reflection, ""who and what enthrals,"" will hardly bear a"
18657,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"comment from one who is, nationally, the friend and the ally of the"
18658,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"conqueror. It may, however, be allowed to say thus much, that to those"
18659,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"who wish to recover their independence, any masters must be an object of"
18660,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,detestation; and it may be safely foretold that this unprofitable
18661,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,aversion will not have been corrected before Venice shall have sunk into

18672,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"his sneers, can no longer instruct or amuse. We must not, however, think"
18673,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,that these memoirs[567] are as much a romance as Belisarius or the
18674,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Incas, although we are told so by Dr. Beattie, a great name, but a"

18676,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"notwithstanding his ""love"" has, like most other passions, made him"
18677,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,ridiculous.[569] The hypothesis which overpowered the struggling
18678,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Italians, and carried along less interested critics in its current, is"
18679,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,run out. We have another proof that we can never be sure that the
18680,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"paradox, the most singular, and therefore having the most agreeable and"
18681,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"authentic air, will not give place to the re-established ancient"
18682,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,prejudice.
18683,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,
18684,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"It seems, then, first, that Laura was born, lived, died, and was buried,"
18685,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"not in Avignon, but in the country. The fountains of the Sorga, the"
18686,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"thickets of Cabrieres, may resume their pretensions, and the exploded"
18687,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,_de la Bastie_ again be heard with complacency. The hypothesis of the
18688,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Abbé had no stronger props than the parchment sonnet and medal found on
18689,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the skeleton of the wife of Hugo de Sade, and the manuscript note to the"
18690,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"_Virgil_ of Petrarch, now in the Ambrosian library. If these proofs were"
18691,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"both incontestable, the poetry was written, the medal composed, cast,"
18692,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,and deposited within the space of twelve hours: and these deliberate
18693,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"duties were performed round the carcass of one who died of the plague,"
18694,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"and was hurried to the grave on the day of her death. These documents,"
18695,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"therefore, are too decisive: they prove not the fact, but the forgery."
18696,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Either the sonnet or the Virgilian note must be a falsification. The
18697,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Abbé cites both as incontestably true; the consequent deduction is
18698,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,inevitable--they are both evidently false.[570]
18699,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,
18700,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Secondly, Laura was never married, and was a haughty virgin rather than"
18701,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"that _tender and prudent_ wife who honoured Avignon, by making that town"
18702,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the theatre of an honest French passion, and played off for one and"
18703,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,twenty years her _little machinery_ of alternate favours and
18704,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"refusals[571] upon the first poet of the age. It was, indeed, rather too"
18705,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,unfair that a female should be made responsible for eleven children upon
18706,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the faith of a misinterpreted abbreviation, and the decision of a"
18707,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"librarian.[572] It is, however, satisfactory to think that the love of"
18708,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Petrarch was not platonic. The happiness which he prayed to possess but
18709,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"once and for a moment was surely not of the mind,[573] and something so"
18710,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"very real as a marriage project, with one who has been idly called a"
18711,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"shadowy nymph, may be, perhaps, detected in at least six places of his"
18712,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,own sonnets. The love of Petrarch was neither platonic nor poetical; and
18713,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"if in one passage of his works he calls it ""amore veementeissimo ma"
18714,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"unico ed onesto,"" he confesses, in a letter to a friend, that it was"
18715,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"guilty and perverse, that it absorbed him quite, and mastered his heart."
18716,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,
18717,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"In this case, however, he was perhaps alarmed for the culpability of his"
18718,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"wishes; for the Abbé de Sade himself, who certainly would not have been"
18719,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,scrupulously delicate if he could have proved his descent from Petrarch
18720,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"as well as Laura, is forced into a stout defence of his virtuous"
18721,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"grandmother. As far as relates to the poet, we have no security for the"
18722,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"innocence, except perhaps in the constancy of his pursuit. He assures us"
18723,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"in his epistle to posterity, that, when arrived at his fortieth year, he"
18724,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"not only had in horror, but had lost all recollection and image of any"
18725,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"""irregularity."" But the birth of his natural daughter cannot be assigned"
18726,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,earlier than his thirty-ninth year; and either the memory or the
18727,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"morality of the poet must have failed him, when he forgot or was guilty"
18728,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,of this _slip_.[574] The weakest argument for the purity of this love
18729,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"has been drawn from the permanence of its effects, which survived the"
18730,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"object of his passion. The reflection of M. de la Bastie, that virtue"
18731,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"alone is capable of making impressions which death cannot efface, is"
18732,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"one of those which everybody applauds, and everybody finds not to be"
18733,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"true, the moment he examines his own breast or the records of human"
18734,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,feeling.[575] Such apophthegms can do nothing for Petrarch or for the
18735,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"cause of morality, except with the very weak and the very young. He that"
18736,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,has made even a little progress beyond ignorance and pupilage cannot be
18737,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,edified with anything but truth. What is called vindicating the honour
18738,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of an individual or a nation, is the most futile, tedious, and"
18739,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,uninstructive of all writing; although it will always meet with more
18740,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"applause than that sober criticism, which is attributed to the malicious"
18741,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,desire of reducing a great man to the common standard of humanity. It
18742,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"is, after all, not unlikely that our historian was right in retaining"

18752,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Petrarch retired to Arquà immediately on his return from the
18753,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"unsuccessful attempt to visit Urban V. at Rome, in the year 1370, and"
18754,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,with the exception of his celebrated visit to Venice in company with
18755,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Francesco Novello da Carrara, he appears to have passed the four last"
18756,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,years of his life between that charming solitude and Padua. For four
18757,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"months previous to his death he was in a state of continual languor, and"
18758,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"in the morning of July the 19th, in the year 1374, was found dead in his"
18759,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,library chair with his head resting upon a book. The chair is still
18760,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"shown amongst the precious relics of Arquà, which, from the"
18761,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,uninterrupted veneration that has been attached to everything relative
18762,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"to this great man from the moment of his death to the present hour,"
18763,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"have, it may be hoped, a better chance of authenticity than the"

18766,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Arquà (for the last syllable is accented in pronunciation, although the"
18767,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,analogy of the English language has been observed in the verse) is
18768,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"twelve miles from Padua, and about three miles on the right of the high"
18769,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"road to Rovigo, in the bosom of the Euganean hills. After a walk of"
18770,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"twenty minutes across a flat well-wooded meadow, you come to a little"
18771,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"blue lake, clear but fathomless, and to the foot of a succession of"
18772,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"acclivities and hills, clothed with vineyards and orchards, rich with"
18773,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"fir and pomegranate trees, and every sunny fruit shrub. From the banks"
18774,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of the lake the road winds into the hills, and the church of Arquà is"
18775,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"soon seen between a cleft where two ridges slope towards each other, and"
18776,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,nearly enclose the village. The houses are scattered at intervals on the
18777,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,steep sides of these summits; and that of the poet is on the edge of a
18778,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"little knoll overlooking two descents, and commanding a view, not only"
18779,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of the glowing gardens in the dales immediately beneath, but of the wide"
18780,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"plains, above whose low woods of mulberry and willow, thickened into a"
18781,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"dark mass by festoons of vines, tall, single cypresses, and the spires"
18782,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of towns, are seen in the distance, which stretches to the mouths of the"
18783,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Po and the shores of the Adriatic. The climate of these volcanic hills
18784,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"is warmer, and the vintage begins a week sooner than in the plains of"
18785,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Padua. Petrarch is laid, for he cannot be said to be buried, in a"
18786,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"sarcophagus of red marble, raised on four pilasters on an elevated base,"
18787,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,and preserved from an association with meaner tombs. It stands
18788,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"conspicuously alone, but will be soon overshadowed by four lately"
18789,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"planted laurels. Petrarch's Fountain, for here everything is Petrarch's,"
18790,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"springs and expands itself beneath an artificial arch, a little below"
18791,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the church, and abounds plentifully, in the driest season, with that"
18792,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,soft water which was the ancient wealth of the Euganean hills. It would
18793,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"be more attractive, were it not, in some seasons, beset with hornets and"
18794,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,wasps. No other coincidence could assimilate the tombs of Petrarch and
18795,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Archilochus. The revolutions of centuries have spared these sequestered
18796,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"valleys, and the only violence which has been offered to the ashes of"
18797,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Petrarch was prompted, not by hate, but veneration. An attempt was made"
18798,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"to rob the sarcophagus of its treasure, and one of the arms was stolen"
18799,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,by a Florentine through a rent which is still visible. The injury is not
18800,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"forgotten, but has served to identify the poet with the country where he"
18801,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"was born, but where he would not live. A peasant boy of Arquà being"
18802,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"asked who Petrarch was, replied, ""that the people of the parsonage knew"
18803,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"all about him, but that he only knew that he was a Florentine."""
18804,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,
18805,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Mr. Forsyth[577] was not quite correct in saying that Petrarch never
18806,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,returned to Tuscany after he had once quitted it when a boy. It appears
18807,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"he did pass through Florence on his way from Parma to Rome, and on his"
18808,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"return in the year 1350, and remained there long enough to form some"
18809,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,acquaintance with its most distinguished inhabitants. A Florentine
18810,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"gentleman, ashamed of the aversion of the poet for his native country,"
18811,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"was eager to point out this trivial error in our accomplished traveller,"
18812,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"whom he knew and respected for an extraordinary capacity, extensive"
18813,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"erudition, and refined taste, joined to that engaging simplicity of"
18814,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"manners which has been so frequently recognised as the surest, though it"
18815,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"is certainly not an indispensable, trait of superior genius."

18823,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"tablet has been raised to him at Parma, in the chapel of St. Agatha, at"
18824,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the cathedral, because he was arch-deacon of that society, and was only"
18825,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,snatched from his intended sepulture in their church by a _foreign_

18847,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of the Italian or the French poet, is eager to observe that the satirist"
18848,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"recanted or explained away this censure, and subsequently allowed the"
18849,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"author of the _Jerusalem_ to be ""a genius sublime, vast, and happily"
18850,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"born for the higher flights of poetry."" To this we will add, that the"
18851,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"recantation is far from satisfactory, when we examine the whole anecdote"
18852,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,as reported by Olivet.[579] The sentence pronounced against him by
18853,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Bouhours[580] is recorded only to the confusion of the critic, whose"
18854,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"_palinodia_ the Italian makes no effort to discover, and would not,"
18855,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"perhaps, accept. As to the opposition which the _Jerusalem_ encountered"
18856,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"from the Cruscan academy, who degraded Tasso from all competition with"
18857,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Ariosto, below Bojardo and Pulci, the disgrace of such opposition must"
18858,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"also in some measure be laid to the charge of Alfonso, and the court of"
18859,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Ferrara. For Leonard Salviati, the principal and nearly the sole origin"
18860,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of this attack, was, there can be no doubt,[581] influenced by a hope to"
18861,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,acquire the favour of the House of Este: an object which he thought
18862,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,attainable by exalting the reputation of a native poet at the expense of
18863,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"a rival, then a _prisoner of state_. The hopes and efforts of Salviati"
18864,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,must serve to show the contemporary opinion as to the nature of the
18865,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,poet's imprisonment; and will fill up the measure of our indignation at
18866,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the tyrant jailer.[582] In fact, the antagonist of Tasso was not"
18867,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,disappointed in the reception given to his criticism; he was called to
18868,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the court of Ferrara, where, having endeavoured to heighten his claims"
18869,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"to favour, by panegyrics on the family of his sovereign,[583] he was in"
18870,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"turn abandoned, and expired in neglected poverty. The opposition of the"
18871,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Cruscans was brought to a close in six years after the commencement of
18872,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,the controversy; and if the Academy owed its first renown to having
18873,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"almost opened with such a paradox,[584] it is probable that, on the"
18874,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"other hand, the care of his reputation alleviated rather than aggravated"
18875,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,the imprisonment of the injured poet. The defence of his father and of
18876,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"himself, for both were involved in the censure of Salviati, found"
18877,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"employment for many of his solitary hours, and the captive could have"
18878,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"been but little embarrassed to reply to accusations, where, among other"
18879,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"delinquencies, he was charged with invidiously omitting, in his"
18880,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"comparison between France and Italy, to make any mention of the cupola"
18881,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,of St. Maria del Fiore at Florence.[585] The late biographer of Ariosto
18882,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,seems as if willing to renew the controversy by doubting the
18883,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,interpretation of Tasso's self-estimation[586] related in Serassi's life
18884,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of the poet. But Tiraboschi had before laid that rivalry at rest,[587]"
18885,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,by showing that between Ariosto and Tasso it is not a question of
18886,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"comparison, but of preference."

18991,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,_Whetter_. It seems strange that the character of that disputed statue
18992,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"should not be entirely decided, at least in the mind of any one who has"
18993,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,seen a sarcophagus in the vestibule of the Basilica of St. Paul without
18994,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"the walls, at Rome, where the whole group of the fable of Marsyas is"
18995,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,seen in tolerable preservation; and the Scythian slave whetting the
18996,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"knife, is represented exactly in the same position as this celebrated"
18997,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,masterpiece. The slave is not naked; but it is easier to get rid of this
18998,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,difficulty than to suppose the knife in the hand of the Florentine
18999,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"statue an instrument for shaving, which it must be, if, as Lanzi"
19000,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"supposes, the man is no other than the barber of Julius Cæsar."
19001,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Winckelmann, illustrating a bas-relief of the same subject, follows the"
19002,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"opinion of Leonard Agostini, and his authority might have been thought"
19003,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"conclusive, even if the resemblance did not strike the most careless"
19004,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"observer.[598] Amongst the bronzes of the same princely collection, is"
19005,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,still to be seen the inscribed tablet copied and commented upon by Mr.
19006,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Gibbon.[599] Our historian found some difficulties, but did not desist"
19007,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,from his illustration. He might be vexed to hear that his criticism has
19008,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,been thrown away on an inscription now generally recognised to be a

19018,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"Italy--but of her whose eloquence was poured over the illustrious ashes,"

19022,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,forbad the steady gaze of disinterested criticism. We have her picture
19023,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"embellished or distorted, as friendship or detraction has held the"

19030,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Corinna has ceased to be a woman--she is only an author; and it may be
19031,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"foreseen that many will repay themselves for former complaisance, by a"
19032,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,severity to which the extravagance of previous praises may perhaps give
19033,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,the colour of truth. The latest posterity--for to the latest posterity
19034,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,they will assuredly descend--will have to pronounce upon her various

19036,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"more accurately minute will be the object, the more certain the justice,"
19037,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,of the decision. She will enter into that existence in which the great
19038,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"writers of all ages and nations are, as it were, associated in a world"

19041,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,will gradually disappear as the author is more distinctly seen; some

19045,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"to love the shade, are, in fact, more frequently chilled than excited by"
19046,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,the domestic cares of private life. Some one should be found to portray

19051,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,affection to qualify for the eye of an indifferent spectator. Some one
19052,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"should be found, not to celebrate, but to describe, the amiable mistress"
19053,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"of an open mansion, the centre of a society, ever varied, and always"

19080,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,exhibited his talents at the Opera-house of Milan. The reading of the
19081,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,theses handed in for the subjects of his poetry was received by a very
19082,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"numerous audience, for the most part in silence, or with laughter; but"
19083,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"when the assistant, unfolding one of the papers, exclaimed _The"

19085,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,the applause was continued for some moments. The lot did not fall on
19086,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,Alfieri; and the Signor Sgricci had to pour forth his extemporary

19090,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,"beforehand, but, in case of any prudential afterthought, steps in to"
19091,MDCCCXV. VICTOR. REDUXIT.,correct the blindness of chance. The proposal for deifying Alfieri was

19112,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,It will readily be imagined that the prejudices which have passed the
19113,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,name of Machiavelli into an epithet proverbial of iniquity exist no
19114,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"longer at Florence. His memory was persecuted, as his life had been, for"
19115,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"an attachment to liberty incompatible with the new system of despotism,"
19116,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,which succeeded the fall of the free governments of Italy. He was put to
19117,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"the torture for being a ""libertine,"" that is, for wishing to restore the"
19118,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,republic of Florence; and such are the undying efforts of those who are
19119,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"interested in the perversion, not only of the nature of actions, but the"
19120,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"meaning of words, that what was once _patriotism_, has by degrees come"
19121,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,to signify _debauch_. We have ourselves outlived the old meaning of
19122,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"""liberality,"" which is now another word for treason in one country and"
19123,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,for infatuation in all. It seems to have been a strange mistake to
19124,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"accuse the author of _The Prince_, as being a pander to tyranny; and to"
19125,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,think that the Inquisition would condemn his work for such a
19126,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"delinquency. The fact is, that Machiavelli, as is usual with those"
19127,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"against whom no crime can be proved, was suspected of and charged with"
19128,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,atheism; and the first and last most violent opposers of _The Prince_
19129,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"were both Jesuits, one of whom persuaded the Inquisition ""benchè fosse"
19130,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"tardo,"" to prohibit the treatise, and the other qualified the secretary"
19131,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,of the Florentine republic as no better than a fool. The father Possevin
19132,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"was proved never to have read the book, and the father Lucchesini not to"
19133,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"have understood it. It is clear, however, that such critics must have"
19134,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"objected not to the slavery of the doctrines, but to the supposed"
19135,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,tendency of a lesson which shows how distinct are the interests of a
19136,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,monarch from the happiness of mankind. The Jesuits are re-established in
19137,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"Italy, and the last chapter of _The Prince_ may again call forth a"
19138,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,particular refutation from those who are employed once more in moulding
19139,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"the minds of the rising generation, so as to receive the impressions of"
19140,NICCOLAVS MACHIAVELLI.,"despotism. The chapter [xxvi.] bears for title, ""Esortazione a liberare"

19172,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",signal for a sentence of irrevocable banishment. He had before lingered
19173,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",near Tuscany with hopes of recall; then travelled into the north of

19208,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","two centuries, when criticism and competition had sobered the judgment"

19600,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","the cavalry, who, the further they advanced, stopped up all the outlets"
19601,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",in the rear. A fog rising from the lake now spread itself over the army

19605,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",height. At the same moment all his troops on the eminences behind and in
19606,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the flank of Flaminius rushed forwards as it were with one accord into
19607,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","the plain. The Romans, who were forming their array in the mist,"
19608,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","suddenly heard the shouts of the enemy amongst them on every side, and"
19609,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","before they could fall into their ranks, or draw their swords, or see by"
19610,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","whom they were attacked, felt at once that they were surrounded and"
19611,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",lost. There are two little rivulets which run from the Gualandra into
19612,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the lake. The traveller crosses the first of these at about a mile after
19613,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","he comes into the plain, and this divides the Tuscan from the Papal"
19614,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","territories. The second, about a quarter of a mile further on, is called"
19615,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","""the bloody rivulet;"" and the peasants point out an open spot to the"
19616,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","left between the ""Sanguinetto"" and the hills, which, they say, was the"

19619,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","except near the edge of the lake. It is, indeed, most probable that the"

19622,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",escaped to the summit of an eminence which must have been in this

19670,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","of the amphitheatre, and, to facilitate its transport, suffered the"
19671,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",temporary amputation of its right arm. The republican tragedians had to
19672,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",plead that the arm was a restoration: but their accusers do not believe
19673,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",that the integrity of the statue would have protected it. The love of
19674,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","finding every coincidence, has discovered the true Cæsarian ichor in a"
19675,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",stain near the right knee; but colder criticism has rejected not only
19676,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","the blood, but the portrait, and assigned the globe of power rather to"
19677,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the first of the emperors than to the last of the republican masters of
19678,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",Rome. Winckelmann[625] is loth to allow an heroic statue of a Roman
19679,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","citizen, but the Grimani Agrippa, a contemporary almost, is heroic; and"
19680,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","naked Roman figures were only very rare, not absolutely forbidden. The"
19681,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","face accords much better with the ""hominem integrum et castum et"
19682,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","gravem,""[626] than with any of the busts of Augustus, and is too stern"
19683,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","for him who was beautiful, says Suetonius, at all periods of his life."
19684,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","The pretended likeness to Alexander the Great cannot be discerned, but"
19685,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the traits resemble the medal of Pompey.[627] The objectionable globe
19686,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",may not have been an ill-applied flattery to him who found Asia Minor
19687,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","the boundary, and left it the centre of the Roman empire. It seems that"
19688,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",Winckelmann has made a mistake in thinking that no proof of the identity
19689,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",of this statue with that which received the bloody sacrifice can be
19690,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",derived from the spot where it was discovered.[628] Flaminius Vacca says
19691,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","_sotto una cantina_, and this cantina is known to have been in the"
19692,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Vicolo de' Leutari, near the Cancellaria; a position corresponding"
19693,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","exactly to that of the Janus before the basilica of Pompey's theatre, to"
19694,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",which Augustus transferred the statue after the _curia_ was either burnt
19695,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","or taken down.[629] Part of the ""Pompeian shade,""[630] the portico,"
19696,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","existed in the beginning of the XVth century, and the _atrium_ was still"
19697,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","called _Satrum_. So says Blondus.[631] At all events, so imposing is the"
19698,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","stern majesty of the statue, and so memorable is the story, that the"
19699,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","play of the imagination leaves no room for the exercise of the judgment,"
19700,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","and the fiction, if a fiction it is, operates on the spectator with an"

19708,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Ancient Rome, like modern Sienna, abounded most probably with images of"
19709,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the foster-mother of her founder; but there were two she-wolves of whom
19710,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","history makes particular mention. One of these, _of brass in ancient"
19711,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","work_, was seen by Dionysius[632] at the temple of Romulus, under the"
19712,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Palatine, and is universally believed to be that mentioned by the Latin"
19713,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","historian, as having been made from the money collected by a fine on"
19714,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","usurers, and as standing under the Ruminal fig-tree.[633] The other was"
19715,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","that which Cicero[634] has celebrated both in prose and verse, and which"
19716,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the historian Dion also records as having suffered the same accident as
19717,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",is alluded to by the orator.[635] The question agitated by the
19718,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","antiquaries is, whether the wolf now in the Conservator's Palace is that"
19719,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","of Livy and Dionysius, or that of Cicero, or whether it is neither one"
19720,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",nor the other. The earlier writers differ as much as the moderns: Lucius
19721,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Faunus[636] says, that it is the one alluded to by both, which is"
19722,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","impossible, and also by Virgil, which may be. Fulvius Ursinus[637] calls"
19723,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","it the wolf of Dionysius, and Marlianus[638] talks of it as the one"
19724,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",mentioned by Cicero. To him Rycquius _tremblingly_ assents.[639]
19725,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",Nardini is inclined to suppose it may be one of the many wolves
19726,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",preserved in ancient Rome; but of the two rather bends to the Ciceronian
19727,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",statue.[640] Montfaucon[641] mentions it as a point without doubt. Of
19728,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the latter writers the decisive Winckelmann[642] proclaims it as having
19729,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","been found at the church of Saint Theodore, where, or near where, was"
19730,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","the temple of Romulus, and consequently makes it the wolf of Dionysius."
19731,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","His authority is Lucius Faunus, who, however, only says that it _was"
19732,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","placed_, not _found_, at the Ficus Ruminalis, by the Comitium, by which"
19733,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",he does not seem to allude to the church of Saint Theodore. Rycquius was
19734,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","the first to make the mistake, and Winckelmann followed Rycquius."
19735,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",
19736,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Flaminius Vacca tells quite a different story, and says he had heard the"
19737,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",wolf with the twins was found[643] near the arch of Septimius Severus.
19738,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",The commentator on Winckelmann is of the same opinion with that learned
19739,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","person, and is incensed at Nardini for not having remarked that Cicero,"
19740,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","in speaking of the wolf struck with lightning in the Capitol, makes use"
19741,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","of the past tense. But, with the Abate's leave, Nardini does not"
19742,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","positively assert the statue to be that mentioned by Cicero, and if he"
19743,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","had, the assumption would not perhaps have been so exceedingly"
19744,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",indiscreet. The Abate himself is obliged to own that there are marks
19745,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",very like the scathing of lightning in the hinder legs of the present
19746,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","wolf; and, to get rid of this, adds, that the wolf seen by Dionysius"
19747,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","might have been also struck by lightning, or otherwise injured."
19748,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",
19749,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",Let us examine the subject by a reference to the words of Cicero. The
19750,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","orator in two places seems to particularise the Romulus and the Remus,"
19751,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","especially the first, which his audience remembered to _have been_ in"
19752,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","the Capitol, as being struck with lightning. In his verses he records"
19753,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","that the twins and wolf both fell, and that the latter left behind the"
19754,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",marks of her feet. Cicero does not say that the wolf was consumed: and
19755,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Dion only mentions that it fell down, without alluding, as the Abate has"
19756,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","made him, to the force of the blow, or the firmness with which it had"
19757,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","been fixed. The whole strength, therefore, of the Abate's argument hangs"
19758,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","upon the past tense; which, however, may be somewhat diminished by"
19759,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",remarking that the phrase only shows that the statue was not then
19760,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",standing in its former position. Winckelmann has observed that the
19761,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",present twins are modern; and it is equally clear that there are marks
19762,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","of gilding on the wolf, which might therefore be supposed to make part"
19763,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",of the ancient group. It is known that the sacred images of the Capitol
19764,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","were not destroyed when injured by time or accident, but were put into"
19765,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","certain underground depositories, called _favissæ_.[644] It may be"
19766,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","thought possible that the wolf had been so deposited, and had been"
19767,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",replaced in some conspicuous situation when the Capitol was rebuilt by
19768,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Vespasian. Rycquius, without mentioning his authority, tells that it was"
19769,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","transferred from the Comitium to the Lateran, and thence brought to the"
19770,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Capitol. If it was found near the arch of Severus, it may have been one"
19771,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",of the images which Orosius[645] says was thrown down in the Forum by
19772,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",lightning when Alaric took the city. That it is of very high antiquity
19773,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the workmanship is a decisive proof; and that circumstance induced
19774,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Winckelmann to believe it the wolf of Dionysius. The Capitoline wolf,"
19775,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","however, may have been of the same early date as that at the temple of"
19776,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",Romulus. Lactantius[646] asserts that in his time the Romans worshipped
19777,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",a wolf; and it is known that the Lupercalia held out to a very late
19778,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",period[647] after every other observance of the ancient superstition
19779,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",had totally expired. This may account for the preservation of the
19780,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",ancient image longer than the other early symbols of Paganism.
19781,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",
19782,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","It may be permitted, however, to remark, that the wolf was a Roman"
19783,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","symbol, but that the worship of that symbol is an inference drawn by the"
19784,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",zeal of Lactantius. The early Christian writers are not to be trusted in
19785,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the charges which they make against the Pagans. Eusebius accused the
19786,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Romans to their faces of worshipping Simon Magus, and raising a statue"
19787,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",to him in the island of the Tyber. The Romans had probably never heard
19788,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","of such a person before, who came, however, to play a considerable,"
19789,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","though scandalous part in the church history, and has left several"
19790,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",tokens of his aërial combat with St. Peter at Rome; notwithstanding that
19791,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",an inscription found in this very island of the Tyber showed the Simon
19792,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",Magus of Eusebius to be a certain indigenal god called Semo Sangus or
19793,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",Fidius.[648]
19794,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",
19795,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",Even when the worship of the founder of Rome had been abandoned it was
19796,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","thought expedient to humour the habits of the good matrons of the city,"
19797,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","by sending them with their sick infants to the church of Saint Theodore,"
19798,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",as they had before carried them to the temple of Romulus.[649] The
19799,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",practice is continued to this day; and the site of the above church
19800,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",seems to be thereby identified with that of the temple; so that if the
19801,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","wolf had been really found there, as Winckelmann says, there would be no"
19802,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",doubt of the present statue being that seen by Dionysius.[650] But
19803,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","Faunus, in saying that it was at the Ficus Ruminalis by the Comitium, is"
19804,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","only talking of its ancient position as recorded by Pliny; and, even if"
19805,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","he had been remarking where it was found, would not have alluded to the"
19806,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","church of Saint Theodore, but to a very different place, near which it"
19807,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","was then thought the Ficus Ruminalis had been, and also the Comitium;"
19808,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","that is, the three columns by the church of Santa Maria Liberatrice, at"
19809,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",the corner of the Palatine looking on the Forum.
19810,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",
19811,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","It is, in fact, a mere conjecture where the image was actually dug up;"
19812,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","and perhaps, on the whole, the marks of the gilding, and of the"
19813,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","lightning, are a better argument in favour of its being the Ciceronian"
19814,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","wolf than any that can be adduced for the contrary opinion. At any rate,"
19815,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]",it is reasonably selected in the text of the poem as one of the most
19816,"QUESTO BARBARO DOMINIO.""[601]","interesting relics of the ancient city,[651] and is certainly the"

19895,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],had been exchanged for injudicious ornament. But the headless statue is
19896,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],"palpably rather a male than a nymph, and has none of the attributes"
19897,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],ascribed to it at present visible. The nine Muses could hardly have
19898,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],stood in six niches; and Juvenal certainly does not allude to any
19899,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],individual cave.[659] Nothing can be collected from the satirist but
19900,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],that somewhere near the Porta Capena was a spot in which it was supposed
19901,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],"Numa held nightly consultations with his nymph, and where there was a"
19902,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],"grove and a sacred fountain, and fanes once consecrated to the Muses;"
19903,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],"and that from this spot there was a descent into the valley of Egeria,"
19904,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],where were several artificial caves. It is clear that the statues of the
19905,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],Muses made no part of the decoration which the satirist thought
19906,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],misplaced in these caves; for he expressly assigns other fanes
19907,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],"(_delubra_) to these divinities above the valley, and moreover tells us"
19908,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],"that they had been ejected to make room for the Jews. In fact, the"

19913,HE WAS JUSTLY SLAIN.[653],"It is probable from the inscription and position, that the cave now"
