230,(A.D. 361),
231,(A.D. 361),
232,(A.D. 361),[Greek:
233,(A.D. 361),"eipate tô basilêi, chamai pese daidalos aula;"
234,(A.D. 361),"ouketi Phoibos echei kaluban, ou mantida daphnên,"
235,(A.D. 361),ou pagan laleousan; apesbeto kai lalon hudôr.]
236,(A.D. 361),
237,(A.D. 361),
238,(A.D. 361),"Years have risen and fallen in darkness or in twilight,"
239,(A.D. 361),"Ages waxed and waned that knew not thee nor thine,"
240,(A.D. 361),"While the world sought light by night and sought not thy light,"
241,(A.D. 361),Since the sad last pilgrim left thy dark mid shrine.
242,(A.D. 361),"Dark the shrine and dumb the fount of song thence welling,"
243,(A.D. 361),"Save for words more sad than tears of blood, that said:"
244,(A.D. 361),"_Tell the king, on earth has fallen the glorious dwelling,_"
245,(A.D. 361),_And the watersprings that spake are quenched and dead._
246,(A.D. 361),"_Not a cell is left the God, no roof, no cover_"
247,(A.D. 361),_In his hand the prophet laurel flowers no more._
248,(A.D. 361),"And the great king's high sad heart, thy true last lover,"
249,(A.D. 361),Felt thine answer pierce and cleave it to the core.
250,(A.D. 361),And he bowed down his hopeless head
251,(A.D. 361),"In the drift of the wild world's tide,"
252,(A.D. 361),"And dying, _Thou hast conquered_, he said,"
253,(A.D. 361),"_Galilean_; he said it, and died."
254,(A.D. 361),And the world that was thine and was ours
255,(A.D. 361),When the Graces took hands with the Hours
256,(A.D. 361),Grew cold as a winter wave
257,(A.D. 361),"In the wind from a wide-mouthed grave,"
258,(A.D. 361),As a gulf wide open to swallow
259,(A.D. 361),The light that the world held dear.
260,(A.D. 361),"O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,"
261,(A.D. 361),"Destroyer and healer, hear!"
262,(A.D. 361),
263,(A.D. 361),"Age on age thy mouth was mute, thy face was hidden,"
264,(A.D. 361),And the lips and eyes that loved thee blind and dumb;
265,(A.D. 361),"Song forsook their tongues that held thy name forbidden,"
266,(A.D. 361),Light their eyes that saw the strange God's kingdom come.
267,(A.D. 361),Fire for light and hell for heaven and psalms for pæans
268,(A.D. 361),"Filled the clearest eyes and lips most sweet of song,"
269,(A.D. 361),When for chant of Greeks the wail of Galileans
270,(A.D. 361),Made the whole world moan with hymns of wrath and wrong.
271,(A.D. 361),"Yea, not yet we see thee, father, as they saw thee,"
272,(A.D. 361),"They that worshipped when the world was theirs and thine,"
273,(A.D. 361),They whose words had power by thine own power to draw thee
274,(A.D. 361),Down from heaven till earth seemed more than heaven divine.
275,(A.D. 361),For the shades are about us that hover
276,(A.D. 361),When darkness is half withdrawn
277,(A.D. 361),And the skirts of the dead night cover
278,(A.D. 361),The face of the live new dawn.
279,(A.D. 361),For the past is not utterly past
280,(A.D. 361),"Though the word on its lips be the last,"
281,(A.D. 361),And the time be gone by with its creed
282,(A.D. 361),"When men were as beasts that bleed,"
283,(A.D. 361),"As sheep or as swine that wallow,"
284,(A.D. 361),In the shambles of faith and of fear.
285,(A.D. 361),"O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,"
286,(A.D. 361),"Destroyer and healer, hear!"
287,(A.D. 361),
288,(A.D. 361),"Yet it may be, lord and father, could we know it,"
289,(A.D. 361),We that love thee for our darkness shall have light
290,(A.D. 361),More than ever prophet hailed of old or poet
291,(A.D. 361),Standing crowned and robed and sovereign in thy sight.
292,(A.D. 361),"To the likeness of one God their dreams enthralled thee,"
293,(A.D. 361),Who wast greater than all Gods that waned and grew;
294,(A.D. 361),"Son of God the shining son of Time they called thee,"
295,(A.D. 361),"Who wast older, O our father, than they knew."
296,(A.D. 361),For no thought of man made Gods to love or honour
297,(A.D. 361),"Ere the song within the silent soul began,"
298,(A.D. 361),Nor might earth in dream or deed take heaven upon her
299,(A.D. 361),Till the word was clothed with speech by lips of man.
300,(A.D. 361),"And the word and the life wast thou,"
301,(A.D. 361),The spirit of man and the breath;
302,(A.D. 361),And before thee the Gods that bow
303,(A.D. 361),Take life at thine hands and death.
304,(A.D. 361),"For these are as ghosts that wane,"
305,(A.D. 361),That are gone in an age or twain;
306,(A.D. 361),"Harsh, merciful, passionate, pure,"
307,(A.D. 361),"They perish, but thou shalt endure;"
308,(A.D. 361),"Be their flight with the swan or the swallow,"
309,(A.D. 361),They pass as the flight of a year.
310,(A.D. 361),"O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,"
311,(A.D. 361),"Destroyer and healer, hear!"
312,(A.D. 361),
313,(A.D. 361),"Thou the word, the light, the life, the breath, the glory,"
314,(A.D. 361),"Strong to help and heal, to lighten and to slay,"
315,(A.D. 361),"Thine is all the song of man, the world's whole story;"
316,(A.D. 361),Not of morning and of evening is thy day.
317,(A.D. 361),Old and younger Gods are buried or begotten
318,(A.D. 361),"From uprising to downsetting of thy sun,"
319,(A.D. 361),"Risen from eastward, fallen to westward and forgotten,"
320,(A.D. 361),"And their springs are many, but their end is one."
321,(A.D. 361),"Divers births of godheads find one death appointed,"
322,(A.D. 361),As the soul whence each was born makes room for each;
323,(A.D. 361),"God by God goes out, discrowned and disanointed,"
324,(A.D. 361),But the soul stands fast that gave them shape and speech.
325,(A.D. 361),Is the sun yet cast out of heaven?
326,(A.D. 361),Is the song yet cast out of man?
327,(A.D. 361),Life that had song for its leaven
328,(A.D. 361),To quicken the blood that ran
329,(A.D. 361),Through the veins of the songless years
330,(A.D. 361),"More bitter and cold than tears,"
331,(A.D. 361),Heaven that had thee for its one
332,(A.D. 361),"Light, life, word, witness, O sun,"
333,(A.D. 361),"Are they soundless and sightless and hollow,"
334,(A.D. 361),"Without eye, without speech, without ear?"
335,(A.D. 361),"O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,"
336,(A.D. 361),"Destroyer and healer, hear!"
337,(A.D. 361),
338,(A.D. 361),"Time arose and smote thee silent at his warning,"
339,(A.D. 361),Change and darkness fell on men that fell from thee;
340,(A.D. 361),"Dark thou satest, veiled with light, behind the morning,"
341,(A.D. 361),Till the soul of man should lift up eyes and see.
342,(A.D. 361),"Till the blind mute soul get speech again and eyesight,"
343,(A.D. 361),Man may worship not the light of life within;
344,(A.D. 361),In his sight the stars whose fires grow dark in thy sight
345,(A.D. 361),Shine as sunbeams on the night of death and sin.
346,(A.D. 361),"Time again is risen with mightier word of warning,"
347,(A.D. 361),Change hath blown again a blast of louder breath;
348,(A.D. 361),"Clothed with clouds and stars and dreams that melt in morning,"
349,(A.D. 361),"Lo, the Gods that ruled by grace of sin and death!"
350,(A.D. 361),"They are conquered, they break, they are stricken,"
351,(A.D. 361),Whose might made the whole world pale;
352,(A.D. 361),They are dust that shall rise not or quicken
353,(A.D. 361),Though the world for their death's sake wail.
354,(A.D. 361),"As a hound on a wild beast's trace,"
355,(A.D. 361),So time has their godhead in chase;
356,(A.D. 361),"As wolves when the hunt makes head,"
357,(A.D. 361),"They are scattered, they fly, they are fled;"
358,(A.D. 361),"They are fled beyond hail, beyond hollo,"
359,(A.D. 361),"And the cry of the chase, and the cheer."
360,(A.D. 361),"O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,"
361,(A.D. 361),"Destroyer and healer, hear!"
362,(A.D. 361),
363,(A.D. 361),"Day by day thy shadow shines in heaven beholden,"
364,(A.D. 361),"Even the sun, the shining shadow of thy face:"
365,(A.D. 361),"King, the ways of heaven before thy feet grow golden;"
366,(A.D. 361),"God, the soul of earth is kindled with thy grace."
367,(A.D. 361),"In thy lips the speech of man whence Gods were fashioned,"
368,(A.D. 361),In thy soul the thought that makes them and unmakes;
369,(A.D. 361),"By thy light and heat incarnate and impassioned,"
370,(A.D. 361),Soul to soul of man gives light for light and takes.
371,(A.D. 361),"As they knew thy name of old time could we know it,"
372,(A.D. 361),"Healer called of sickness, slayer invoked of wrong,"
373,(A.D. 361),"Light of eyes that saw thy light, God, king, priest, poet,"
374,(A.D. 361),Song should bring thee back to heal us with thy song.
375,(A.D. 361),"For thy kingdom is past not away,"
376,(A.D. 361),Nor thy power from the place thereof hurled;
377,(A.D. 361),"Out of heaven they shall cast not the day,"
378,(A.D. 361),They shall cast not out song from the world.
379,(A.D. 361),By the song and the light they give
380,(A.D. 361),We know thy works that they live;
381,(A.D. 361),With the gift thou hast given us of speech
382,(A.D. 361),"We praise, we adore, we beseech,"
383,(A.D. 361),"We arise at thy bidding and follow,"
384,(A.D. 361),"We cry to thee, answer, appear,"
385,(A.D. 361),"O father of all of us, Paian, Apollo,"
386,(A.D. 361),"Destroyer and healer, hear!"
387,(A.D. 361),
388,(A.D. 361),

498,XI,Ungrieved of earthly floor-work? hath it spread

538,XV,Made her ways flowerier and their flowers more sweet
539,XV,"With childlike passage of a god to be,"

547,XVI,From rock to rock reverberate; and the whole
548,XVI,Sea laughed and lightened with a deathless deed
549,XVI,That sowed our enemies in her field for seed

553,XVII,XVII
554,XVII,
555,XVII,"Then in her green south fields, a poor man's child,"
556,XVII,"Thou hadst thy short sweet fill of half-blown joy,"
557,XVII,That ripens all of us for time to cloy
558,XVII,With full-blown pain and passion; ere the wild
559,XVII,"World caught thee by the fiery heart, and smiled"
560,XVII,To make so swift end of the godlike boy.
561,XVII,

563,XVIII,XVIII

567,XVIII,Who knows what splendour of strange dreams was shed
568,XVIII,With sacred shadow and glimmer of gold and red

584,XX,
585,XX,"Like sunrise never wholly risen, nor yet"

587,XX,A light to lighten as from living eyes
588,XX,The cold unlit close lids of one that lies
589,XX,"Dead, or a ray returned from death's far skies"
590,XX,To fire us living lest our lives forget.
591,XX,
592,XX,
593,XXI,XXI

598,XXI,"We know not, even thy brethren; yea, not we"

608,XXII,Much higher than thou as thou much higher than we--

611,XXII,

613,XXIII,XXIII
614,XXIII,
615,XXIII,"All those that here were of thy kind and kin,"
616,XXIII,"Beside thee and below thee, full of love,"
617,XXIII,"Full-souled for song,--and one alone above"
618,XXIII,Whose only light folds all your glories in--
619,XXIII,With all birds' notes from nightingale to dove
620,XXIII,Fill the world whither we too fain would win.
621,XXIII,
622,XXIII,
623,XXIV,XXIV
624,XXIV,
625,XXIV,The world that sees in heaven the sovereign light
626,XXIV,"Of sunlike Shakespeare, and the fiery night"
627,XXIV,"Whose stars were watched of Webster; and beneath,"
628,XXIV,"The twin-souled brethren of the single wreath,"
629,XXIV,"Grown in kings' gardens, plucked from pastoral heath,"

638,XXV,Athwart the incestuous prisoner's bride-house bars;

641,XXV,
642,XXV,
643,XXVI,XXVI

645,XXVI,And one light risen since theirs to run such race
646,XXVI,"Thou hast seen, O Phosphor, from thy pride of place."
647,XXVI,"Thou hast seen Shelley, him that was to thee"
648,XXVI,"As light to fire or dawn to lightning; me,"

654,XXVII,
655,XXVII,You twain the same swift year of manhood swept
656,XXVII,"Down the steep darkness, and our father wept."
657,XXVII,And from the gleam of Apollonian tears
658,XXVII,"A holier aureole rounds your memories, kept"
659,XXVII,"Most fervent-fresh of all the singing spheres,"

667,XXVIII,Ye from beyond the dark dividing date
668,XXVIII,"Stand smiling, crowned as gods with foot on fate."
669,XXVIII,"For stronger was your blessing than his ban,"

674,XXIX,
675,XXIX,"Yet love and loathing, faith and unfaith yet"
676,XXIX,"Bind less to greater souls in unison,"
677,XXIX,And one desire that makes three spirits as one
678,XXIX,Takes great and small as in one spiritual net
679,XXIX,Woven out of hope toward what shall yet be done
680,XXIX,Ere hate or love remember or forget.
681,XXIX,
682,XXIX,
683,XXX,XXX
684,XXX,
685,XXX,Woven out of faith and hope and love too great
686,XXX,To bear the bonds of life and death and fate:
687,XXX,Woven out of love and hope and faith too dear
688,XXX,To take the print of doubt and change and fear:

698,XXXI,And as thorns crackling this man's laugh is vain.

708,XXXII,And underfoot the fang-drawn worm that strove
709,XXXII,"To wound you living; from so far above,"
710,XXXII,"Look love, not scorn, on ours that was your land."
711,XXXII,

716,XXXIII,To clothe us and to comfort us with might.
717,XXXIII,What help is ours to take or give? but ye--
718,XXXIII,"O, more than sunrise to the blind cold sea,"
719,XXXIII,"That wailed aloud with all her waves all night,"
720,XXXIII,"Much more, being much more glorious, should you be."
721,XXXIII,
722,XXXIII,
723,XXXIV,XXXIV
724,XXXIV,
725,XXXIV,"As fire to frost, as ease to toil, as dew"
726,XXXIV,"To flowerless fields, as sleep to slackening pain,"
727,XXXIV,As hope to souls long weaned from hope again
728,XXXIV,"Returning, or as blood revived anew"
729,XXXIV,"To dry-drawn limbs and every pulseless vein,"
730,XXXIV,Even so toward us should no man be but you.

734,XXXV,
735,XXXV,"One rose before the sunrise was, and one"

737,XXXV,And now the heaven is dark and bright and loud
738,XXXV,"With wind and starry drift and moon and cloud,"
739,XXXV,"And night's cry rings in straining sheet and shroud,"
740,XXXV,What help is ours if hope like yours be none?
741,XXXV,
742,XXXV,
743,XXXVI,XXXVI
744,XXXVI,
745,XXXVI,"O well-beloved, our brethren, if ye be,"
746,XXXVI,Then are we not forsaken. This kind earth
747,XXXVI,"Made fragrant once for all time with your birth,"
748,XXXVI,"And bright for all men with your love, and worth"
749,XXXVI,"The clasp and kiss and wedlock of the sea,"
750,XXXVI,Were not your mother if not your brethren we.
751,XXXVI,
752,XXXVI,
753,XXXVII,XXXVII
754,XXXVII,
755,XXXVII,Because the days were dark with gods and kings
756,XXXVII,"And in time's hand the old hours of time as rods,"
757,XXXVII,"When force and fear set hope and faith at odds,"
758,XXXVII,Ye failed not nor abased your plume-plucked wings;
759,XXXVII,"And we that front not more disastrous things,"
760,XXXVII,How should we fail in face of kings and gods?
761,XXXVII,
762,XXXVII,
763,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
764,XXXVIII,
765,XXXVIII,For now the deep dense plumes of night are thinned
766,XXXVIII,Surely with winnowing of the glimmering wind
767,XXXVIII,Whose feet are fledged with morning; and the breath
768,XXXVIII,Begins in heaven that sings the dark to death.
769,XXXVIII,And all the night wherein men groaned and sinned
770,XXXVIII,Sickens at heart to hear what sundawn saith.

778,XXXIX,"The spirit of man lest truth should make him free,"
779,XXXIX,"The sunrise and the sunset, seeing one star,"

787,XL,Look yet but seaward from a land-locked bay;

796,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
797,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland,"
798,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee,"
799,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Walled round with rocks as an inland island,"
800,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The ghost of a garden fronts the sea.
801,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses
802,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The steep square slope of the blossomless bed
803,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses
804,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Now lie dead.
805,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
806,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,"
807,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,To the low last edge of the long lone land.
808,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"If a step should sound or a word be spoken,"
809,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand?
810,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless,"
811,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Through branches and briars if a man make way,"
812,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless"
813,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Night and day.
814,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
815,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The dense hard passage is blind and stifled
816,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,That crawls by a track none turn to climb
817,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,To the strait waste place that the years have rifled
818,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time.
819,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;
820,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The rocks are left when he wastes the plain.
821,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,"
822,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,These remain.
823,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
824,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;
825,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry;
826,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,"
827,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Could she call, there were never a rose to reply."
828,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Over the meadows that blossom and wither
829,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song;
830,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Only the sun and the rain come hither
831,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,All year long.
832,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
833,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels
834,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath.
835,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Only the wind here hovers and revels
836,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,In a round where life seems barren as death.
837,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,"
838,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Haply, of lovers none ever will know,"
839,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping
840,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Years ago.
841,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
842,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Heart handfast in heart as they stood, ""Look thither,"""
843,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Did he whisper? ""look forth from the flowers to the sea;"
844,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,"
845,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"And men that love lightly may die--but we?"""
846,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened,"
847,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"And or ever the garden's last petals were shed,"
848,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,"
849,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Love was dead.
850,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
851,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?"
852,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,And were one to the end--but what end who knows?
853,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,"
854,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose.
855,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?
856,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,What love was ever as deep as a grave?
857,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,They are loveless now as the grass above them
858,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Or the wave.
859,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
860,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"All are at one now, roses and lovers,"
861,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea.
862,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Not a breath of the time that has been hovers
863,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,In the air now soft with a summer to be.
864,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter
865,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep,"
866,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter
867,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,We shall sleep.
868,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
869,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Here death may deal not again for ever;
870,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Here change may come not till all change end.
871,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"From the graves they have made they shall rise up never,"
872,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Who have left nought living to ravage and rend.
873,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing,"
874,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"While the sun and the rain live, these shall be;"
875,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing
876,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Roll the sea.
877,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,
878,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,"
879,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink,"
880,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble
881,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink,"
882,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Here now in his triumph where all things falter,"
883,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread,"
884,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,"As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,"
885,A FORSAKEN GARDEN,Death lies dead.

894,RELICS,A white star made of memory long ago
895,RELICS,Lit in the heaven of dear times dead to me.
896,RELICS,
897,RELICS,A star out of the skies love used to know
898,RELICS,"Here held in hand, a stray left yet to show"
899,RELICS,What flowers my heart was full of in the days
900,RELICS,That are long since gone down dead memory's flow.
901,RELICS,
902,RELICS,"Dead memory that revives on doubtful ways,"
903,RELICS,Half hearkening what the buried season says
904,RELICS,Out of the world of the unapparent dead
905,RELICS,"Where the lost Aprils are, and the lost Mays."
906,RELICS,
907,RELICS,"Flower, once I knew thy star-white brethren bred"
908,RELICS,Nigh where the last of all the land made head
909,RELICS,"Against the sea, a keen-faced promontory,"
910,RELICS,Flowers on salt wind and sprinkled sea-dews fed.
911,RELICS,
912,RELICS,Their hearts were glad of the free place's glory;
913,RELICS,The wind that sang them all his stormy story
914,RELICS,"Had talked all winter to the sleepless spray,"
915,RELICS,And as the sea's their hues were hard and hoary.
916,RELICS,
917,RELICS,"Like things born of the sea and the bright day,"
918,RELICS,"They laughed out at the years that could not slay,"
919,RELICS,"Live sons and joyous of unquiet hours,"
920,RELICS,And stronger than all storms that range for prey.
921,RELICS,
922,RELICS,And in the close indomitable flowers
923,RELICS,A keen-edged odour of the sun and showers
924,RELICS,Was as the smell of the fresh honeycomb
925,RELICS,Made sweet for mouths of none but paramours.
926,RELICS,
927,RELICS,Out of the hard green wall of leaves that clomb
928,RELICS,"They showed like windfalls of the snow-soft foam,"
929,RELICS,"Or feathers from the weary south-wind's wing,"
930,RELICS,Fair as the spray that it came shoreward from.
931,RELICS,
932,RELICS,"And thou, as white, what word hast thou to bring?"
933,RELICS,"If my heart hearken, whereof wilt thou sing?"
934,RELICS,"For some sign surely thou too hast to bear,"
935,RELICS,Some word far south was taught thee of the spring.
936,RELICS,
937,RELICS,"White like a white rose, not like these that were"
938,RELICS,"Taught of the wind's mouth and the winter air,"
939,RELICS,"Poor tender thing of soft Italian bloom,"

942,RELICS,"Born in what spring and on what city's tomb,"
943,RELICS,"By whose hand wast thou reached, and plucked for whom?"
944,RELICS,"There hangs about thee, could the soul's sense tell,"
945,RELICS,An odour as of love and of love's doom.
946,RELICS,
947,RELICS,"Of days more sweet than thou wast sweet to smell,"
948,RELICS,"Of flower-soft thoughts that came to flower and fell,"
949,RELICS,"Of loves that lived a lily's life and died,"
950,RELICS,Of dreams now dwelling where dead roses dwell.
951,RELICS,
952,RELICS,O white birth of the golden mountain-side
953,RELICS,That for the sun's love makes its bosom wide
954,RELICS,"At sunrise, and with all its woods and flowers"
955,RELICS,Takes in the morning to its heart of pride!
956,RELICS,
957,RELICS,"Thou hast a word of that one land of ours,"
958,RELICS,"And of the fair town called of the Fair Towers,"
959,RELICS,"A word for me of my San Gimignan,"
960,RELICS,A word of April's greenest-girdled hours.
961,RELICS,
962,RELICS,Of the old breached walls whereon the wallflowers ran
963,RELICS,"Called of Saint Fina, breachless now of man,"
964,RELICS,"Though time with soft feet break them stone by stone,"
965,RELICS,Who breaks down hour by hour his own reign's span.
966,RELICS,
967,RELICS,Of the old cliff overcome and overgrown
968,RELICS,"That all that flowerage clothed as flesh clothes bone,"
969,RELICS,"That garment of acacias made for May,"
970,RELICS,Whereof here lies one witness overblown.
971,RELICS,
972,RELICS,"The fair brave trees with all their flowers at play,"
973,RELICS,How king-like they stood up into the day!
974,RELICS,"How sweet the day was with them, and the night!"
975,RELICS,Such words of message have dead flowers to say.
976,RELICS,
977,RELICS,"This that the winter and the wind made bright,"
978,RELICS,"And this that lived upon Italian light,"
979,RELICS,"Before I throw them and these words away,"
980,RELICS,Who knows but I what memories too take flight?

988,AT A MONTH'S END,More strange the change of you and me.
989,AT A MONTH'S END,"Once more, for the old love's love forsaken,"
990,AT A MONTH'S END,We went out once more toward the sea.
991,AT A MONTH'S END,
992,AT A MONTH'S END,"For the old love's love-sake dead and buried,"
993,AT A MONTH'S END,"One last time, one more and no more,"

995,AT A MONTH'S END,Spears of the tide storming the shore.
996,AT A MONTH'S END,
997,AT A MONTH'S END,"Hardly we saw the high moon hanging,"

1001,AT A MONTH'S END,

1006,AT A MONTH'S END,
1007,AT A MONTH'S END,"Faint lights fell this way, that way floated,"
1008,AT A MONTH'S END,Quick sparks of sea-fire keen like eyes

1010,AT A MONTH'S END,Shores and faint cliffs and bays and skies.
1011,AT A MONTH'S END,
1012,AT A MONTH'S END,The ghost of sea that shrank up sighing
1013,AT A MONTH'S END,"At the sand's edge, a short sad breath"
1014,AT A MONTH'S END,"Trembling to touch the goal, and dying"
1015,AT A MONTH'S END,With weak heart heaved up once in death--
1016,AT A MONTH'S END,
1017,AT A MONTH'S END,The rustling sand and shingle shaken
1018,AT A MONTH'S END,With light sweet touches and small sound--
1019,AT A MONTH'S END,"These could not move us, could not waken"
1020,AT A MONTH'S END,"Hearts to look forth, eyes to look round."
1021,AT A MONTH'S END,
1022,AT A MONTH'S END,"Silent we went an hour together,"
1023,AT A MONTH'S END,Under grey skies by waters white.

1025,AT A MONTH'S END,Clouds and blown stars and broken light.
1026,AT A MONTH'S END,
1027,AT A MONTH'S END,Full of cold clouds and moonbeams drifted
1028,AT A MONTH'S END,"And streaming storms and straying fires,"
1029,AT A MONTH'S END,Our souls in us were stirred and shifted
1030,AT A MONTH'S END,By doubts and dreams and foiled desires.
1031,AT A MONTH'S END,
1032,AT A MONTH'S END,"Across, aslant, a scudding sea-mew"
1033,AT A MONTH'S END,"Swam, dipped, and dropped, and grazed the sea:"
1034,AT A MONTH'S END,And one with me I could not dream you;
1035,AT A MONTH'S END,And one with you I could not be.
1036,AT A MONTH'S END,
1037,AT A MONTH'S END,As the white wing the white wave's fringes
1038,AT A MONTH'S END,Touched and slid over and flashed past--
1039,AT A MONTH'S END,As a pale cloud a pale flame tinges
1040,AT A MONTH'S END,From the moon's lowest light and last--
1041,AT A MONTH'S END,
1042,AT A MONTH'S END,"As a star feels the sun and falters,"
1043,AT A MONTH'S END,Touched to death by diviner eyes--
1044,AT A MONTH'S END,As on the old gods' untended altars
1045,AT A MONTH'S END,The old lire of withered worship dies--
1046,AT A MONTH'S END,
1047,AT A MONTH'S END,"(Once only, once the shrine relighted"
1048,AT A MONTH'S END,"Sees the last fiery shadow shine,"
1049,AT A MONTH'S END,"Last shadow of flame and faith benighted,"
1050,AT A MONTH'S END,Sees falter and flutter and fail the shrine)
1051,AT A MONTH'S END,
1052,AT A MONTH'S END,So once with fiery breath and flying
1053,AT A MONTH'S END,"Your winged heart touched mine and went,"
1054,AT A MONTH'S END,"And the swift spirits kissed, and sighing,"
1055,AT A MONTH'S END,Sundered and smiled and were content.
1056,AT A MONTH'S END,
1057,AT A MONTH'S END,"That only touch, that feeling only,"
1058,AT A MONTH'S END,"Enough we found, we found too much;"
1059,AT A MONTH'S END,For the unlit shrine is hardly lonely
1060,AT A MONTH'S END,As one the old fire forgets to touch.
1061,AT A MONTH'S END,
1062,AT A MONTH'S END,"Slight as the sea's sight of the sea-mew,"
1063,AT A MONTH'S END,Slight as the sun's sight of the star:
1064,AT A MONTH'S END,Enough to show one must not deem you
1065,AT A MONTH'S END,For love's sake other than you are.
1066,AT A MONTH'S END,
1067,AT A MONTH'S END,Who snares and tames with fear and danger
1068,AT A MONTH'S END,"A bright beast of a fiery kin,"
1069,AT A MONTH'S END,"Only to mar, only to change her"
1070,AT A MONTH'S END,Sleek supple soul and splendid skin?
1071,AT A MONTH'S END,
1072,AT A MONTH'S END,"Easy with blows to mar and maim her,"
1073,AT A MONTH'S END,Easy with bonds to bind and bruise;

1075,AT A MONTH'S END,"The limbs to mar, the soul to lose?"
1076,AT A MONTH'S END,
1077,AT A MONTH'S END,"Best leave or take the perfect creature,"
1078,AT A MONTH'S END,Take all she is or leave complete;

1080,AT A MONTH'S END,Change feet for wings or wings for feet.
1081,AT A MONTH'S END,
1082,AT A MONTH'S END,"Strange eyes, new limbs, can no man give her;"
1083,AT A MONTH'S END,Sweet is the sweet thing as it is.
1084,AT A MONTH'S END,"No soul she hath, we see, to outlive her;"
1085,AT A MONTH'S END,Hath she for that no lips to kiss?
1086,AT A MONTH'S END,
1087,AT A MONTH'S END,"So may one read his weird, and reason,"
1088,AT A MONTH'S END,And with vain drugs assuage no pain.
1089,AT A MONTH'S END,For each man in his loving season
1090,AT A MONTH'S END,Fools and is fooled of these in vain.
1091,AT A MONTH'S END,

1095,AT A MONTH'S END,All hurts with nothing of relief.
1096,AT A MONTH'S END,
1097,AT A MONTH'S END,"Ah, too soon shot, the fool's bolt misses!"
1098,AT A MONTH'S END,What help? the world is full of loves;
1099,AT A MONTH'S END,"Night after night of running kisses,"
1100,AT A MONTH'S END,Chirp after chirp of changing doves.
1101,AT A MONTH'S END,
1102,AT A MONTH'S END,Should Love disown or disesteem you
1103,AT A MONTH'S END,For loving one man more or less?
1104,AT A MONTH'S END,"You could not tame your light white sea-mew,"
1105,AT A MONTH'S END,Nor I my sleek black pantheress.
1106,AT A MONTH'S END,
1107,AT A MONTH'S END,"For a new soul let whoso please pray,"

1109,AT A MONTH'S END,"For you the jungle and me the sea-spray,"
1110,AT A MONTH'S END,And south for you and north for me.
1111,AT A MONTH'S END,
1112,AT A MONTH'S END,But this one broken foam-white feather
1113,AT A MONTH'S END,"I throw you off the hither wing,"
1114,AT A MONTH'S END,"Splashed stiff with sea-scurf and salt weather,"
1115,AT A MONTH'S END,This song for sleep to learn and sing--
1116,AT A MONTH'S END,
1117,AT A MONTH'S END,"Sing in your ear when, daytime over,"
1118,AT A MONTH'S END,"You, couched at long length on hot sand"
1119,AT A MONTH'S END,"With some sleek sun-discoloured lover,"
1120,AT A MONTH'S END,Wince from his breach as from a brand:
1121,AT A MONTH'S END,
1122,AT A MONTH'S END,"Till the acrid hour aches out and ceases,"
1123,AT A MONTH'S END,"And the sheathed eyeball sleepier swims,"
1124,AT A MONTH'S END,The deep flank smoothes its dimpling creases.
1125,AT A MONTH'S END,And passion loosens all the limbs:
1126,AT A MONTH'S END,
1127,AT A MONTH'S END,Till dreams of sharp grey north-sea weather
1128,AT A MONTH'S END,"Fall faint upon your fiery sleep,"
1129,AT A MONTH'S END,As on strange sands a strayed bird's feather
1130,AT A MONTH'S END,The wind may choose to lose or keep.
1131,AT A MONTH'S END,
1132,AT A MONTH'S END,"But I, who leave my queen of panthers,"
1133,AT A MONTH'S END,As a tired honey-heavy bee
1134,AT A MONTH'S END,Gilt with sweet dust from gold-grained anthers
1135,AT A MONTH'S END,"Leaves the rose-chalice, what for me?"
1136,AT A MONTH'S END,
1137,AT A MONTH'S END,"From the ardours of the chaliced centre,"
1138,AT A MONTH'S END,"From the amorous anthers' golden grime,"
1139,AT A MONTH'S END,"That scorch and smutch all wings that enter,"
1140,AT A MONTH'S END,I fly forth hot from honey-time.
1141,AT A MONTH'S END,
1142,AT A MONTH'S END,But as to a bee's gilt thighs and winglets
1143,AT A MONTH'S END,The flower-dust with the flower-smell clings;
1144,AT A MONTH'S END,As a snake's mobile rampant ringlets
1145,AT A MONTH'S END,Leave the sand marked with print of rings;
1146,AT A MONTH'S END,
1147,AT A MONTH'S END,So to my soul in surer fashion
1148,AT A MONTH'S END,Your savage stamp and savour hangs;
1149,AT A MONTH'S END,"The print and perfume of old passion,"
1150,AT A MONTH'S END,The wild-beast mark of panther's fangs.

1158,SESTINA,"As a bird sleeping in the nest of night,"
1159,SESTINA,Among soft leaves that give the starlight way
1160,SESTINA,To touch its wings but not its eyes with light;
1161,SESTINA,"So that it knew as one in visions may,"
1162,SESTINA,"And knew not as men waking, of delight."
1163,SESTINA,
1164,SESTINA,This was the measure of my soul's delight;
1165,SESTINA,"It had no power of joy to fly by day,"
1166,SESTINA,Nor part in the large lordship of the light;
1167,SESTINA,But in a secret moon-beholden way
1168,SESTINA,"Had all its will of dreams and pleasant night,"
1169,SESTINA,And all the love and life that sleepers may.
1170,SESTINA,
1171,SESTINA,But such life's triumph as men waking may
1172,SESTINA,It might not have to feed its faint delight
1173,SESTINA,"Between the stars by night and sun by day,"
1174,SESTINA,Shut up with green leaves and a little light;
1175,SESTINA,"Because its way was as a lost star's way,"
1176,SESTINA,A world's not wholly known of day or night.
1177,SESTINA,
1178,SESTINA,All loves and dreams and sounds and gleams of night
1179,SESTINA,"Made it all music that such minstrels may,"
1180,SESTINA,And all they had they gave it of delight;
1181,SESTINA,But in the full face of the fire of day
1182,SESTINA,"What place shall be for any starry light,"
1183,SESTINA,What part of heaven in all the wide sun's way?
1184,SESTINA,
1185,SESTINA,"Yet the soul woke not, sleeping by the way,"
1186,SESTINA,"Watched as a nursling of the large-eyed night,"
1187,SESTINA,"And sought no strength nor knowledge of the day,"
1188,SESTINA,"Nor closer touch conclusive of delight,"
1189,SESTINA,"Nor mightier joy nor truer than dreamers may,"
1190,SESTINA,"Nor more of song than they, nor more of light."
1191,SESTINA,
1192,SESTINA,For who sleeps once and sees the secret light
1193,SESTINA,Whereby sleep shows the soul a fairer way
1194,SESTINA,"Between the rise and rest of day and night,"
1195,SESTINA,"Shall care no more to fare as all men may,"
1196,SESTINA,"But be his place of pain or of delight,"
1197,SESTINA,"There shall he dwell, beholding night as day."
1198,SESTINA,
1199,SESTINA,"Song, have thy day and take thy fill of light"
1200,SESTINA,Before the night be fallen across thy way;

1208,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,From the depths of the green garden-closes
1209,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,Where the summer in darkness dozes
1210,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,Till autumn pluck from his hand
1211,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,An hour-glass that holds not a sand;
1212,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,From the maze that a flower-belt encloses
1213,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,To the stones and sea-grass on the strand
1214,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,How red was the reign of the roses
1215,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,Over the rose-crowned land!
1216,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,
1217,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,The year of the rose is brief;
1218,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"From the first blade blown to the sheaf,"
1219,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"From the thin green leaf to the gold,"
1220,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"It has time to be sweet and grow old,"
1221,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,To triumph and leave not a leaf
1222,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,For witness in winter's sight
1223,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,How lovers once in the light
1224,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"Would mix their breath with its breath,"
1225,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"And its spirit was quenched not of night,"
1226,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,As love is subdued not of death.
1227,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,
1228,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,In the red-rose land not a mile
1229,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"Of the meadows from stile to stile,"
1230,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"Of the valleys from stream to stream,"
1231,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,But the air was a long sweet dream
1232,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,And the earth was a sweet wide smile
1233,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"Red-mouthed of a goddess, returned"
1234,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"From the sea which had borne her and burned,"
1235,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,That with one swift smile of her mouth
1236,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"Looked full on the north as it yearned,"
1237,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,And the north was more than the south.
1238,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,
1239,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"For the north, when winter was long,"
1240,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"In his heart had made him a song,"
1241,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"And clothed it with wings of desire,"
1242,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"And shod it with shoon as of fire,"
1243,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,To carry the tale of his wrong
1244,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,To the south-west wind by the sea.
1245,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,That none might bear it but he
1246,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,To the ear of the goddess unknown
1247,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,Who waits till her time shall be
1248,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,To take the world for a throne.
1249,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,
1250,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"In the earth beneath, and above"
1251,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"In the heaven where her name is love,"
1252,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,She warms with light from her eyes
1253,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"The seasons of life as they rise,"
1254,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"And her eyes are as eyes of a dove,"
1255,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,But the wings that lift her and bear
1256,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"As an eagle's, and all her hair"
1257,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"As fire by the wind's breath curled,"
1258,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"And her passage is song through the air,"
1259,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,And her presence is spring through the world.
1260,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,
1261,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"So turned she northward and came,"
1262,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,And the white-thorn land was aflame
1263,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"With the fires that were shed from her feet,"
1264,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"That the north, by her love made sweet,"
1265,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,Should be called by a rose-red name;
1266,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"And a murmur was heard as of doves,"
1267,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,And a music beginning of loves
1268,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"In the light that the roses made,"
1269,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"Such light as the music loves,"
1270,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,The music of man with maid.
1271,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,
1272,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"But the days drop one upon one,"
1273,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,And a chill soft wind is begun
1274,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,In the heart of the rose-red maze
1275,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,That weeps for the roseleaf days
1276,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,And the reign of the rose undone
1277,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"That ruled so long in the light,"
1278,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"And by spirit, and not by sight,"
1279,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"Through the darkness thrilled with its breath,"
1280,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"Still ruled in the viewless night,"
1281,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,As love might rule over death.
1282,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,
1283,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,The time of lovers is brief;
1284,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,From the fair first joy to the grief
1285,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"That tells when love is grown old,"
1286,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"From the warm wild kiss to the cold,"
1287,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"From the red to the white-rose leaf,"
1288,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,They have but a season to seem
1289,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,As roseleaves lost on a stream
1290,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,That part not and pass not apart
1291,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"As a spirit from dream to dream,"
1292,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,As a sorrow from heart to heart.
1293,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,
1294,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,From the bloom and the gloom that encloses
1295,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,The death-bed of Love where he dozes
1296,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,Till a relic be left not of sand
1297,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,To the hour-glass that breaks in his hand;
1298,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,From the change in the grey garden-closes
1299,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,"To the last stray grass of the strand,"
1300,THE YEAR OF THE ROSE,A rain and ruin of roses

1509,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,I was arisen out of my still small bed
1510,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"To see the knights tilt, and one said to me"
1511,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"""The king,"" and seeing him, somewhat stopped my breath,"

1518,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,
1519,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,Howbeit I shall not die an evil death
1520,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"Who have loved in such a sad and sinless way,"

1524,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,Thou nor no man will quite despise me dead.
1525,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,And dying I pray with all my low last breath
1526,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"That thy whole life may be as was that day,"
1527,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"That feast-day that made trothplight death and me,"
1528,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,Giving the world light of thy great deeds done;

1532,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"That all things goodly and glad remain with her,"
1533,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,All things that make glad life and goodly death;

1535,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"Honey, when summer draws delighted breath,"
1536,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"Her soul may drink of thy soul in like way,"
1537,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,And love make life a fruitful marriage-bed
1538,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,Where day may bring forth fruits of joy to day
1539,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,And night to night till days and nights be dead.
1540,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"And as she gives light of her love to thee,"
1541,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,Give thou to her the old glory of days long done;
1542,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"And either give some heat of light to me,"
1543,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,To warm me where I sleep without the sun.
1544,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,
1545,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"O sunflower made drunken with the sun,"

1547,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"Great king, glad lover, I have a word to thee."
1548,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"There is a weed lives out of the sun's way,"
1549,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"Hid from the heat deep in the meadow's bed,"
1550,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"That swoons and whitens at the wind's least breath,"
1551,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"A flower star-shaped, that all a summer day"
1552,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,Will gaze her soul out on the sunflower
1553,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,For very love till twilight finds her dead.
1554,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"But the great sunflower heeds not her poor death,"
1555,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,Knows not when all her loving life is done;
1556,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,And so much knows my lord the king of me.
1557,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,
1558,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"Aye, all day long he has no eye for me;"

1561,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"From birthplace to the flame-lit place of death,"
1562,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,From eastern end to western of his way.
1563,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"So mine eye follows thee, my sunflower,"
1564,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"So the white star-flower turns and yearns to thee,"
1565,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"The sick weak weed, not well alive or dead,"
1566,THE COMPLAINT OF LISA,"Trod underfoot if any pass by her,"

2426,A BIRTH-SONG,Where no dreams laugh or weep
2427,A BIRTH-SONG,Borne through bright gates of birth
2428,A BIRTH-SONG,Into the dim sweet light

2746,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,
2747,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,
2748,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,Bird of the bitter bright grey golden morn
2749,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"Scarce risen upon the dusk of dolorous years,"
2750,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,First of us all and sweetest singer born
2751,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,Whose far shrill note the world of new men hears
2752,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,Cleave the cold shuddering shade as twilight clears;
2753,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,When song new-born put off the old world's attire
2754,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"And felt its tune on her changed lips expire,"
2755,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,Writ foremost on the roll of them that came
2756,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"Fresh girt for service of the latter lyre,"
2757,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name!"
2758,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,
2759,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"Alas the joy, the sorrow, and the scorn,"
2760,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"That clothed thy life with hopes and sins and fears,"
2761,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,And gave thee stones for bread and tares for corn
2762,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,And plume-plucked gaol-birds for thy starveling peers
2763,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,Till death clipt close their flight with shameful shears;
2764,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"Till shifts came short and loves were hard to hire,"
2765,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,When lilt of song nor twitch of twangling wire
2766,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,Could buy thee bread or kisses; when light fame
2767,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"Spurned like a ball and haled through brake and briar,"
2768,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name!"
2769,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,
2770,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,Poor splendid wings so frayed and soiled and torn!
2771,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,Poor kind wild eyes so dashed with light quick tears!
2772,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"Poor perfect voice, most blithe when most forlorn,"
2773,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,That rings athwart the sea whence no man steers
2774,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,Like joy-bells crossed with death-bells in our ears!
2775,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,What far delight has cooled the fierce desire
2776,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,That like some ravenous bird was strong to tire
2777,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame,"
2778,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"But left more sweet than roses to respire,"
2779,PRINCE OF ALL BALLAD-MAKERS,"Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name?"

2785,ENVOI,"A harlot was thy nurse, a God thy sire;"
2786,ENVOI,"Shame soiled thy song, and song assoiled thy shame."
2787,ENVOI,"But from thy feet now death has washed the mire,"
2788,ENVOI,"Love reads out first at head of all our quire,"
2789,ENVOI,"Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name."

2796,PASTICHE,Now the days are all gone over
2797,PASTICHE,"Of our singing, love by lover,"
2798,PASTICHE,Days of summer-coloured seas
2799,PASTICHE,Blown adrift through beam and breeze.
2800,PASTICHE,
2801,PASTICHE,Now the nights are all past over
2802,PASTICHE,"Of our dreaming, dreams that hover"
2803,PASTICHE,"In a mist of fair false things,"
2804,PASTICHE,Nights afloat on wide wan wings.
2805,PASTICHE,
2806,PASTICHE,"Now the loves with faith for mother,"
2807,PASTICHE,"Now the fears with hope for brother,"
2808,PASTICHE,"Scarce are with us as strange words,"
2809,PASTICHE,Notes from songs of last year's birds.
2810,PASTICHE,
2811,PASTICHE,Now all good that comes or goes is
2812,PASTICHE,"As the smell of last year's roses,"
2813,PASTICHE,As the radiance in our eyes
2814,PASTICHE,Shot from summer's ere he dies.
2815,PASTICHE,
2816,PASTICHE,Now the morning faintlier risen
2817,PASTICHE,"Seems no God come forth of prison,"
2818,PASTICHE,"But a bird of plume-plucked wing,"
2819,PASTICHE,Pale with thoughts of evening.
2820,PASTICHE,
2821,PASTICHE,"Now hath hope, outraced in running,"
2822,PASTICHE,Given the torch up of his cunning
2823,PASTICHE,And the palm he thought to wear
2824,PASTICHE,Even to his own strong child--despair.

2842,BEFORE SUNSET,Time that made us and will slay
2843,BEFORE SUNSET,Laughs at love in me and thee;

2856,SONG,"And his eyes with tears were red,"
2857,SONG,And pale his lips as the dead.
2858,SONG,
2859,SONG,And fear and sorrow and scorn
2860,SONG,"Kept watch by his head forlorn,"
2861,SONG,Till the night was overworn
2862,SONG,And the world was merry with morn.
2863,SONG,
2864,SONG,And Joy came up with the day
2865,SONG,"And kissed Love's lips as he lay,"
2866,SONG,And the watchers ghostly and grey
2867,SONG,Sped from his pillow away.
2868,SONG,
2869,SONG,"And his eyes as the dawn grew bright,"

2880,I,
2881,I,"O tender time that love thinks long to see,"
2882,I,Sweet foot of spring that with her footfall sows
2883,I,"Late snowlike flowery leavings of the snows,"
2884,I,Be not too long irresolute to be;
2885,I,"O mother-month, where have they hidden thee?"
2886,I,Out of the pale time of the flowerless rose
2887,I,"I reach my heart out toward the springtime lands,"
2888,I,"I stretch my spirit forth to the fair hours,"
2889,I,The purplest of the prime;
2890,I,"I lean my soul down over them, with hands"
2891,I,Made wide to take the ghostly growths of flowers;
2892,I,I send my love back to the lovely time.
2893,I,
2894,I,
2895,II,II
2896,II,
2897,II,Where has the greenwood hid thy gracious head?
2898,II,"Veiled with what visions while the grey world grieves,"
2899,II,"Or muffled with what shadows of green leaves,"
2900,II,What warm intangible green shadows spread
2901,II,To sweeten the sweet twilight for thy bed?
2902,II,What sleep enchants thee? what delight deceives?
2903,II,Where the deep dreamlike dew before the dawn
2904,II,Feels not the fingers of the sunlight yet
2905,II,"Its silver web unweave,"
2906,II,Thy footless ghost on some unfooted lawn
2907,II,Whose air the unrisen sunbeams fear to fret
2908,II,Lives a ghost's life of daylong dawn and eve.

2912,III,
2913,III,"Sunrise it sees not, neither set of star,"
2914,III,"Large nightfall, nor imperial plenilune,"
2915,III,Nor strong sweet shape of the full-breasted noon;
2916,III,"But where the silver-sandalled shadows are,"
2917,III,"Too soft for arrows of the sun to mar,"
2918,III,Moves with the mild gait of an ungrown moon:
2919,III,"Hard overhead the half-lit crescent swims,"
2920,III,"The tender-coloured night draws hardly breath,"
2921,III,The light is listening;
2922,III,"They watch the dawn of slender-shapen limbs,"
2923,III,"Virginal, born again of doubtful death,"
2924,III,Chill foster-father of the weanling spring.
2925,III,
2926,III,
2927,IV,IV
2928,IV,
2929,IV,"As sweet desire of day before the day,"
2930,IV,"As dreams of love before the true love born,"
2931,IV,From the outer edge of winter overworn
2932,IV,The ghost arisen of May before the May
2933,IV,"Takes through dim air her unawakened way,"
2934,IV,The gracious ghost of morning risen ere morn.
2935,IV,With little unblown breasts and child-eyed looks
2936,IV,"Following, the very maid, the girl-child spring,"
2937,IV,"Lifts windward her bright brows,"
2938,IV,"Dips her light feet in warm and moving brooks,"
2939,IV,And kindles with her own mouth's colouring
2940,IV,The fearful firstlings of the plumeless boughs.
2941,IV,
2942,IV,
2943,V,V
2944,V,
2945,V,"I seek thee sleeping, and awhile I see,"
2946,V,"Fair face that art not, how thy maiden breath"
2947,V,Shall put at last the deadly days to death
2948,V,And fill the fields and fire the woods with thee
2949,V,And seaward hollows where my feet would be
2950,V,When heaven shall hear the word that April saith
2951,V,"To change the cold heart of the weary time,"
2952,V,"To stir and soften all the time to tears,"
2953,V,Tears joyfuller than mirth;
2954,V,As even to May's clear height the young days climb
2955,V,With feet not swifter than those fair first years
2956,V,Whose flowers revive not with thy flowers on earth.
2957,V,
2958,V,
2959,VI,VI
2960,VI,
2961,VI,"I would not bid thee, though I might, give back"
2962,VI,One good thing youth has given and borne away;
2963,VI,I crave not any comfort of the day
2964,VI,"That is not, nor on time's retrodden track"
2965,VI,Would turn to meet the white-robed hours or black
2966,VI,That long since left me on their mortal way;
2967,VI,"Nor light nor love that has been, nor the breath"
2968,VI,That comes with morning from the sun to be
2969,VI,And sets light hope on fire;
2970,VI,"No fruit, no flower thought once too fair for death,"
2971,VI,"No flower nor hour once fallen from life's green tree,"
2972,VI,No leaf once plucked or once fulfilled desire.
2973,VI,
2974,VI,
2975,VII,VII
2976,VII,
2977,VII,The morning song beneath the stars that fled
2978,VII,"With twilight through the moonless mountain air,"
2979,VII,While youth with burning lips and wreathless hair
2980,VII,"Sang toward the sun that was to crown his head,"
2981,VII,"Rising; the hopes that triumphed and fell dead,"
2982,VII,The sweet swift eyes and songs of hours that were;
2983,VII,"These may'st thou not give back for ever; these,"
2984,VII,"As at the sea's heart all her wrecks lie waste,"
2985,VII,Lie deeper than the sea;
2986,VII,"But flowers thou may'st, and winds, and hours of ease,"
2987,VII,And all its April to the world thou may'st
2988,VII,"Give back, and half my April back to me."

2996,CHORIAMBICS,"lovely, we thought, with love?"
2997,CHORIAMBICS,"What sweet visions of sleep lured thee away, down"
2998,CHORIAMBICS,from the light above?
2999,CHORIAMBICS,
3000,CHORIAMBICS,"What strange faces of dreams, voices that called,"
3001,CHORIAMBICS,"hands that were raised to wave,"
3002,CHORIAMBICS,"Lured or led thee, alas, out of the sun, down to the"
3003,CHORIAMBICS,sunless grave?
3004,CHORIAMBICS,
3005,CHORIAMBICS,"Ah, thy luminous eyes! once was their light fed with"
3006,CHORIAMBICS,the fire of day;
3007,CHORIAMBICS,"Now their shadowy lids cover them close, hush them"
3008,CHORIAMBICS,and hide away.
3009,CHORIAMBICS,
3010,CHORIAMBICS,"Ah, thy snow-coloured hands! once were they chains,"
3011,CHORIAMBICS,mighty to bind me fast;
3012,CHORIAMBICS,"Now no blood in them burns, mindless of love, senseless"
3013,CHORIAMBICS,of passion past.
3014,CHORIAMBICS,
3015,CHORIAMBICS,"Ah, thy beautiful hair! so was it once braided for"
3016,CHORIAMBICS,"me, for me;"
3017,CHORIAMBICS,"Now for death is it crowned, only for death, lover"
3018,CHORIAMBICS,and lord of thee.
3019,CHORIAMBICS,
3020,CHORIAMBICS,"Sweet, the kisses of death set on thy lips, colder are"
3021,CHORIAMBICS,they than mine;
3022,CHORIAMBICS,Colder surely than past kisses that love poured for
3023,CHORIAMBICS,thy lips as wine.
3024,CHORIAMBICS,
3025,CHORIAMBICS,"Lov'st thou death? is his face fairer than love's,"
3026,CHORIAMBICS,brighter to look upon?
3027,CHORIAMBICS,"Seest thou light in his eyes, light by which love's"
3028,CHORIAMBICS,pales and is overshone?
3029,CHORIAMBICS,
3030,CHORIAMBICS,"Lo the roses of death, grey as the dust, chiller of leaf"
3031,CHORIAMBICS,than snow!
3032,CHORIAMBICS,"Why let fall from thy hand love's that were thine,"
3033,CHORIAMBICS,roses that loved thee so?
3034,CHORIAMBICS,
3035,CHORIAMBICS,"Large red lilies of love, sceptral and tall, lovely for"
3036,CHORIAMBICS,eyes to see;
3037,CHORIAMBICS,"Thornless blossom of love, full of the sun, fruits that"
3038,CHORIAMBICS,were reared for thee.
3039,CHORIAMBICS,
3040,CHORIAMBICS,"Now death's poppies alone circle thy hair, girdle thy"
3041,CHORIAMBICS,breasts as white;
3042,CHORIAMBICS,"Bloodless blossoms of death, leaves that have sprung"
3043,CHORIAMBICS,never against the light.
3044,CHORIAMBICS,
3045,CHORIAMBICS,"Nay then, sleep if thou wilt; love is content; what"
3046,CHORIAMBICS,should he do to weep?
3047,CHORIAMBICS,Sweet was love to thee once; now in thine eyes
3048,CHORIAMBICS,sweeter than love is sleep.

3056,AT PARTING,Folded us round from the dark and the light;
3057,AT PARTING,"And our hearts were fulfilled of the music he made with us,"
3058,AT PARTING,"Made with our hearts and our lips while he stayed with us,"
3059,AT PARTING,Stayed in mid passage his pinions from flight
3060,AT PARTING,For a day and a night.
3061,AT PARTING,
3062,AT PARTING,"From his foes that kept watch with his wings had he hidden us,"
3063,AT PARTING,"Covered us close from the eyes that would smite,"
3064,AT PARTING,From the feet that had tracked and the tongues that had chidden us
3065,AT PARTING,Sheltering in shade of the myrtles forbidden us
3066,AT PARTING,Spirit and flesh growing one with delight
3067,AT PARTING,For a day and a night.
3068,AT PARTING,
3069,AT PARTING,But his wings will not rest and his feet will not stay for us:
3070,AT PARTING,Morning is here in the joy of its might;
3071,AT PARTING,With his breath has he sweetened a night and a day for us;
3072,AT PARTING,"Now let him pass, and the myrtles make way for us;"
3073,AT PARTING,Love can but last in us here at his height
3074,AT PARTING,For a day and a night.

4822,DEDICATION,I pledged you a health from a beaker of mine
4823,DEDICATION,But halfway filled to the lip's edge yet
4824,DEDICATION,With hope for honey and song for wine.
4825,DEDICATION,
4826,DEDICATION,Nine years have risen and eight years set
4827,DEDICATION,Since there by the wellspring our hands on it met:
4828,DEDICATION,"And the pledge of my songs that were then to be,"
4829,DEDICATION,"I could wonder not, friend, though a friend should forget."
4830,DEDICATION,
4831,DEDICATION,"For life's helm rocks to the windward and lee,"
4832,DEDICATION,"And time is as wind, and as waves are we;"
4833,DEDICATION,"And song is as foam that the sea-winds fret,"
4834,DEDICATION,Though the thought at its heart should be deep as the sea.
4835,DEDICATION,
