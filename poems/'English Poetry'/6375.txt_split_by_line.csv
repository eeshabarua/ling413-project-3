33,INTRODUCTION.,
34,INTRODUCTION.,The following curious collection I have gathered together during
35,INTRODUCTION.,"several years' reading in out-of-the-way corners. Manuscripts, in"
36,INTRODUCTION.,"public and private libraries; old books picked up on dusty bookstalls,"
37,INTRODUCTION.,or carried away as prizes from the battlefield of the auction-room;
38,INTRODUCTION.,"even pencillings on the inside of tattered bindings,--all have been"
39,INTRODUCTION.,"laid under contribution. I trust this medley, or _pot-pourri_, of"
40,INTRODUCTION.,"snatches of song, grave and gay, will prove as interesting to my"
41,INTRODUCTION.,readers as they have been to myself. They claim attention on various
42,INTRODUCTION.,"grounds: some are the works of well-known men, such as Anthony Munday"
43,INTRODUCTION.,"and Warren Hastings; some are bitter political squibs--such, for"
44,INTRODUCTION.,"instance, as the ""Satyre against the Scots,"" page 47; some, again, are"
45,INTRODUCTION.,"exquisitely beautiful, as ""The Dirge,"" page 53. A few have appeared in"
46,INTRODUCTION.,"different collections: but none of my readers, I will undertake to"
47,INTRODUCTION.,"say, have seen more than a half-dozen or so."
