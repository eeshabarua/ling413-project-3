219,GOBLIN MARKET,Maids heard the goblins cry:
220,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Come buy our orchard fruits,"
221,GOBLIN MARKET,"Come buy, come buy:"
222,GOBLIN MARKET,"Apples and quinces,"
223,GOBLIN MARKET,"Lemons and oranges,"

233,GOBLIN MARKET,"In summer weather,--"
234,GOBLIN MARKET,"Morns that pass by,"
235,GOBLIN MARKET,Fair eves that fly;
236,GOBLIN MARKET,"Come buy, come buy:"
237,GOBLIN MARKET,"Our grapes fresh from the vine,                                    20"
238,GOBLIN MARKET,"Pomegranates full and fine,"

248,GOBLIN MARKET,"Come buy, come buy.'"
249,GOBLIN MARKET,
250,GOBLIN MARKET,Evening by evening
251,GOBLIN MARKET,"Among the brookside rushes,"
252,GOBLIN MARKET,"Laura bowed her head to hear,"
253,GOBLIN MARKET,Lizzie veiled her blushes:
254,GOBLIN MARKET,Crouching close together
255,GOBLIN MARKET,"In the cooling weather,"
256,GOBLIN MARKET,"With clasping arms and cautioning lips,"
257,GOBLIN MARKET,With tingling cheeks and finger tips.
258,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Lie close,' Laura said,                                           40"
259,GOBLIN MARKET,Pricking up her golden head:
260,GOBLIN MARKET,"'We must not look at goblin men,"
261,GOBLIN MARKET,We must not buy their fruits:
262,GOBLIN MARKET,Who knows upon what soil they fed
263,GOBLIN MARKET,Their hungry thirsty roots?'
264,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Come buy,' call the goblins"
265,GOBLIN MARKET,Hobbling down the glen.
266,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Oh,' cried Lizzie, 'Laura, Laura,"
267,GOBLIN MARKET,You should not peep at goblin men.'
268,GOBLIN MARKET,"Lizzie covered up her eyes,                                        50"
269,GOBLIN MARKET,Covered close lest they should look;
270,GOBLIN MARKET,"Laura reared her glossy head,"
271,GOBLIN MARKET,And whispered like the restless brook:
272,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,"
273,GOBLIN MARKET,Down the glen tramp little men.
274,GOBLIN MARKET,"One hauls a basket,"
275,GOBLIN MARKET,"One bears a plate,"
276,GOBLIN MARKET,One lugs a golden dish
277,GOBLIN MARKET,Of many pounds weight.
278,GOBLIN MARKET,How fair the vine must grow                                        60
279,GOBLIN MARKET,Whose grapes are so luscious;
280,GOBLIN MARKET,How warm the wind must blow
281,GOBLIN MARKET,Through those fruit bushes.'
282,GOBLIN MARKET,"'No,' said Lizzie, 'No, no, no;"
283,GOBLIN MARKET,"Their offers should not charm us,"
284,GOBLIN MARKET,Their evil gifts would harm us.'
285,GOBLIN MARKET,She thrust a dimpled finger
286,GOBLIN MARKET,"In each ear, shut eyes and ran:"
287,GOBLIN MARKET,Curious Laura chose to linger
288,GOBLIN MARKET,Wondering at each merchant man.                                    70
289,GOBLIN MARKET,"One had a cat's face,"
290,GOBLIN MARKET,"One whisked a tail,"
291,GOBLIN MARKET,"One tramped at a rat's pace,"
292,GOBLIN MARKET,"One crawled like a snail,"
293,GOBLIN MARKET,"One like a wombat prowled obtuse and furry,"
294,GOBLIN MARKET,One like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry.
295,GOBLIN MARKET,She heard a voice like voice of doves
296,GOBLIN MARKET,Cooing all together:
297,GOBLIN MARKET,They sounded kind and full of loves
298,GOBLIN MARKET,In the pleasant weather.                                           80
299,GOBLIN MARKET,
300,GOBLIN MARKET,Laura stretched her gleaming neck
301,GOBLIN MARKET,"Like a rush-imbedded swan,"
302,GOBLIN MARKET,"Like a lily from the beck,"
303,GOBLIN MARKET,"Like a moonlit poplar branch,"
304,GOBLIN MARKET,Like a vessel at the launch
305,GOBLIN MARKET,When its last restraint is gone.
306,GOBLIN MARKET,
307,GOBLIN MARKET,Backwards up the mossy glen
308,GOBLIN MARKET,"Turned and trooped the goblin men,"
309,GOBLIN MARKET,"With their shrill repeated cry,"
310,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Come buy, come buy.'                                              90"
311,GOBLIN MARKET,When they reached where Laura was
312,GOBLIN MARKET,"They stood stock still upon the moss,"
313,GOBLIN MARKET,"Leering at each other,"
314,GOBLIN MARKET,Brother with queer brother;
315,GOBLIN MARKET,"Signalling each other,"
316,GOBLIN MARKET,Brother with sly brother.
317,GOBLIN MARKET,"One set his basket down,"
318,GOBLIN MARKET,One reared his plate;
319,GOBLIN MARKET,One began to weave a crown
320,GOBLIN MARKET,"Of tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown                         100"
321,GOBLIN MARKET,(Men sell not such in any town);
322,GOBLIN MARKET,One heaved the golden weight
323,GOBLIN MARKET,Of dish and fruit to offer her:
324,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Come buy, come buy,' was still their cry."
325,GOBLIN MARKET,"Laura stared but did not stir,"
326,GOBLIN MARKET,Longed but had no money:
327,GOBLIN MARKET,The whisk-tailed merchant bade her taste
328,GOBLIN MARKET,"In tones as smooth as honey,"
329,GOBLIN MARKET,"The cat-faced purr'd,"
330,GOBLIN MARKET,The rat-faced spoke a word                                        110
331,GOBLIN MARKET,"Of welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;"
332,GOBLIN MARKET,One parrot-voiced and jolly
333,GOBLIN MARKET,Cried 'Pretty Goblin' still for 'Pretty Polly;'--
334,GOBLIN MARKET,One whistled like a bird.
335,GOBLIN MARKET,
336,GOBLIN MARKET,But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:
337,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Good folk, I have no coin;"
338,GOBLIN MARKET,To take were to purloin:
339,GOBLIN MARKET,"I have no copper in my purse,"
340,GOBLIN MARKET,"I have no silver either,"
341,GOBLIN MARKET,And all my gold is on the furze                                   120
342,GOBLIN MARKET,That shakes in windy weather
343,GOBLIN MARKET,Above the rusty heather.'
344,GOBLIN MARKET,"'You have much gold upon your head,'"
345,GOBLIN MARKET,They answered all together:
346,GOBLIN MARKET,'Buy from us with a golden curl.'
347,GOBLIN MARKET,"She clipped a precious golden lock,"
348,GOBLIN MARKET,"She dropped a tear more rare than pearl,"
349,GOBLIN MARKET,Then sucked their fruit globes fair or red:
350,GOBLIN MARKET,"Sweeter than honey from the rock,"
351,GOBLIN MARKET,"Stronger than man-rejoicing wine,                                 130"
352,GOBLIN MARKET,Clearer than water flowed that juice;
353,GOBLIN MARKET,"She never tasted such before,"
354,GOBLIN MARKET,How should it cloy with length of use?
355,GOBLIN MARKET,She sucked and sucked and sucked the more
356,GOBLIN MARKET,Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;
357,GOBLIN MARKET,She sucked until her lips were sore;
358,GOBLIN MARKET,Then flung the emptied rinds away
359,GOBLIN MARKET,"But gathered up one kernel stone,"
360,GOBLIN MARKET,And knew not was it night or day
361,GOBLIN MARKET,As she turned home alone.                                         140
362,GOBLIN MARKET,
363,GOBLIN MARKET,Lizzie met her at the gate
364,GOBLIN MARKET,Full of wise upbraidings:
365,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Dear, you should not stay so late,"
366,GOBLIN MARKET,Twilight is not good for maidens;
367,GOBLIN MARKET,Should not loiter in the glen
368,GOBLIN MARKET,In the haunts of goblin men.
369,GOBLIN MARKET,"Do you not remember Jeanie,"
370,GOBLIN MARKET,"How she met them in the moonlight,"
371,GOBLIN MARKET,"Took their gifts both choice and many,"
372,GOBLIN MARKET,Ate their fruits and wore their flowers                           150
373,GOBLIN MARKET,Plucked from bowers
374,GOBLIN MARKET,Where summer ripens at all hours?
375,GOBLIN MARKET,But ever in the noonlight
376,GOBLIN MARKET,She pined and pined away;
377,GOBLIN MARKET,"Sought them by night and day,"
378,GOBLIN MARKET,"Found them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;"
379,GOBLIN MARKET,"Then fell with the first snow,"
380,GOBLIN MARKET,While to this day no grass will grow
381,GOBLIN MARKET,Where she lies low:
382,GOBLIN MARKET,I planted daisies there a year ago                                160
383,GOBLIN MARKET,That never blow.
384,GOBLIN MARKET,You should not loiter so.'
385,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Nay, hush,' said Laura:"
386,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Nay, hush, my sister:"
387,GOBLIN MARKET,"I ate and ate my fill,"
388,GOBLIN MARKET,Yet my mouth waters still;
389,GOBLIN MARKET,To-morrow night I will
390,GOBLIN MARKET,Buy more:' and kissed her:
391,GOBLIN MARKET,'Have done with sorrow;
392,GOBLIN MARKET,I'll bring you plums to-morrow                                    170
393,GOBLIN MARKET,"Fresh on their mother twigs,"
394,GOBLIN MARKET,Cherries worth getting;
395,GOBLIN MARKET,You cannot think what figs
396,GOBLIN MARKET,"My teeth have met in,"
397,GOBLIN MARKET,What melons icy-cold
398,GOBLIN MARKET,Piled on a dish of gold
399,GOBLIN MARKET,"Too huge for me to hold,"
400,GOBLIN MARKET,"What peaches with a velvet nap,"
401,GOBLIN MARKET,Pellucid grapes without one seed:
402,GOBLIN MARKET,Odorous indeed must be the mead                                   180
403,GOBLIN MARKET,"Whereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink"
404,GOBLIN MARKET,"With lilies at the brink,"
405,GOBLIN MARKET,And sugar-sweet their sap.'
406,GOBLIN MARKET,
407,GOBLIN MARKET,"Golden head by golden head,"
408,GOBLIN MARKET,Like two pigeons in one nest
409,GOBLIN MARKET,"Folded in each other's wings,"
410,GOBLIN MARKET,They lay down in their curtained bed:
411,GOBLIN MARKET,"Like two blossoms on one stem,"
412,GOBLIN MARKET,"Like two flakes of new-fall'n snow,"
413,GOBLIN MARKET,Like two wands of ivory                                           190
414,GOBLIN MARKET,Tipped with gold for awful kings.
415,GOBLIN MARKET,"Moon and stars gazed in at them,"
416,GOBLIN MARKET,"Wind sang to them lullaby,"
417,GOBLIN MARKET,"Lumbering owls forbore to fly,"
418,GOBLIN MARKET,Not a bat flapped to and fro
419,GOBLIN MARKET,Round their rest:
420,GOBLIN MARKET,Cheek to cheek and breast to breast
421,GOBLIN MARKET,Locked together in one nest.
422,GOBLIN MARKET,
423,GOBLIN MARKET,Early in the morning
424,GOBLIN MARKET,"When the first cock crowed his warning,                           200"
425,GOBLIN MARKET,"Neat like bees, as sweet and busy,"
426,GOBLIN MARKET,Laura rose with Lizzie:
427,GOBLIN MARKET,"Fetched in honey, milked the cows,"
428,GOBLIN MARKET,"Aired and set to rights the house,"
429,GOBLIN MARKET,"Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,"
430,GOBLIN MARKET,"Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,"
431,GOBLIN MARKET,"Next churned butter, whipped up cream,"
432,GOBLIN MARKET,"Fed their poultry, sat and sewed;"
433,GOBLIN MARKET,Talked as modest maidens should:
434,GOBLIN MARKET,"Lizzie with an open heart,                                        210"
435,GOBLIN MARKET,"Laura in an absent dream,"
436,GOBLIN MARKET,"One content, one sick in part;"
437,GOBLIN MARKET,"One warbling for the mere bright day's delight,"
438,GOBLIN MARKET,One longing for the night.
439,GOBLIN MARKET,
440,GOBLIN MARKET,At length slow evening came:
441,GOBLIN MARKET,They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;
442,GOBLIN MARKET,"Lizzie most placid in her look,"
443,GOBLIN MARKET,Laura most like a leaping flame.
444,GOBLIN MARKET,They drew the gurgling water from its deep;
445,GOBLIN MARKET,"Lizzie plucked purple and rich golden flags,                      220"
446,GOBLIN MARKET,Then turning homeward said: 'The sunset flushes
447,GOBLIN MARKET,Those furthest loftiest crags;
448,GOBLIN MARKET,"Come, Laura, not another maiden lags,"
449,GOBLIN MARKET,"No wilful squirrel wags,"
450,GOBLIN MARKET,The beasts and birds are fast asleep.'
451,GOBLIN MARKET,But Laura loitered still among the rushes
452,GOBLIN MARKET,And said the bank was steep.
453,GOBLIN MARKET,
454,GOBLIN MARKET,And said the hour was early still
455,GOBLIN MARKET,"The dew not fall'n, the wind not chill:"
456,GOBLIN MARKET,"Listening ever, but not catching                                  230"
457,GOBLIN MARKET,"The customary cry,"
458,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Come buy, come buy,'"
459,GOBLIN MARKET,With its iterated jingle
460,GOBLIN MARKET,Of sugar-baited words:
461,GOBLIN MARKET,Not for all her watching
462,GOBLIN MARKET,Once discerning even one goblin
463,GOBLIN MARKET,"Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;"
464,GOBLIN MARKET,Let alone the herds
465,GOBLIN MARKET,"That used to tramp along the glen,"
466,GOBLIN MARKET,"In groups or single,                                              240"
467,GOBLIN MARKET,Of brisk fruit-merchant men.
468,GOBLIN MARKET,
469,GOBLIN MARKET,"Till Lizzie urged, 'O Laura, come;"
470,GOBLIN MARKET,I hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:
471,GOBLIN MARKET,You should not loiter longer at this brook:
472,GOBLIN MARKET,Come with me home.
473,GOBLIN MARKET,"The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,"
474,GOBLIN MARKET,"Each glowworm winks her spark,"
475,GOBLIN MARKET,Let us get home before the night grows dark:
476,GOBLIN MARKET,For clouds may gather
477,GOBLIN MARKET,"Though this is summer weather,                                    250"
478,GOBLIN MARKET,Put out the lights and drench us through;
479,GOBLIN MARKET,Then if we lost our way what should we do?'
480,GOBLIN MARKET,
481,GOBLIN MARKET,Laura turned cold as stone
482,GOBLIN MARKET,"To find her sister heard that cry alone,"
483,GOBLIN MARKET,"That goblin cry,"
484,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Come buy our fruits, come buy.'"
485,GOBLIN MARKET,Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?
486,GOBLIN MARKET,"Must she no more such succous pasture find,"
487,GOBLIN MARKET,Gone deaf and blind?
488,GOBLIN MARKET,Her tree of life drooped from the root:                           260
489,GOBLIN MARKET,She said not one word in her heart's sore ache;
490,GOBLIN MARKET,"But peering thro' the dimness, nought discerning,"
491,GOBLIN MARKET,"Trudged home, her pitcher dripping all the way;"
492,GOBLIN MARKET,"So crept to bed, and lay"
493,GOBLIN MARKET,Silent till Lizzie slept;
494,GOBLIN MARKET,"Then sat up in a passionate yearning,"
495,GOBLIN MARKET,"And gnashed her teeth for baulked desire, and wept"
496,GOBLIN MARKET,As if her heart would break.
497,GOBLIN MARKET,
498,GOBLIN MARKET,"Day after day, night after night,"
499,GOBLIN MARKET,Laura kept watch in vain                                          270
500,GOBLIN MARKET,In sullen silence of exceeding pain.
501,GOBLIN MARKET,She never caught again the goblin cry:
502,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Come buy, come buy;'--"
503,GOBLIN MARKET,She never spied the goblin men
504,GOBLIN MARKET,Hawking their fruits along the glen:
505,GOBLIN MARKET,But when the noon waxed bright
506,GOBLIN MARKET,Her hair grew thin and grey;
507,GOBLIN MARKET,"She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn"
508,GOBLIN MARKET,To swift decay and burn
509,GOBLIN MARKET,Her fire away.                                                    280
510,GOBLIN MARKET,
511,GOBLIN MARKET,One day remembering her kernel-stone
512,GOBLIN MARKET,She set it by a wall that faced the south;
513,GOBLIN MARKET,"Dewed it with tears, hoped for a root,"
514,GOBLIN MARKET,"Watched for a waxing shoot,"
515,GOBLIN MARKET,But there came none;
516,GOBLIN MARKET,"It never saw the sun,"
517,GOBLIN MARKET,It never felt the trickling moisture run:
518,GOBLIN MARKET,While with sunk eyes and faded mouth
519,GOBLIN MARKET,"She dreamed of melons, as a traveller sees"
520,GOBLIN MARKET,False waves in desert drouth                                      290
521,GOBLIN MARKET,"With shade of leaf-crowned trees,"
522,GOBLIN MARKET,And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.
523,GOBLIN MARKET,
524,GOBLIN MARKET,"She no more swept the house,"
525,GOBLIN MARKET,"Tended the fowls or cows,"
526,GOBLIN MARKET,"Fetched honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,"
527,GOBLIN MARKET,Brought water from the brook:
528,GOBLIN MARKET,But sat down listless in the chimney-nook
529,GOBLIN MARKET,And would not eat.
530,GOBLIN MARKET,
531,GOBLIN MARKET,Tender Lizzie could not bear
532,GOBLIN MARKET,To watch her sister's cankerous care                              300
533,GOBLIN MARKET,Yet not to share.
534,GOBLIN MARKET,She night and morning
535,GOBLIN MARKET,Caught the goblins' cry:
536,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Come buy our orchard fruits,"
537,GOBLIN MARKET,"Come buy, come buy:'--"
538,GOBLIN MARKET,"Beside the brook, along the glen,"
539,GOBLIN MARKET,"She heard the tramp of goblin men,"
540,GOBLIN MARKET,The voice and stir
541,GOBLIN MARKET,Poor Laura could not hear;
542,GOBLIN MARKET,"Longed to buy fruit to comfort her,                               310"
543,GOBLIN MARKET,But feared to pay too dear.
544,GOBLIN MARKET,"She thought of Jeanie in her grave,"
545,GOBLIN MARKET,Who should have been a bride;
546,GOBLIN MARKET,But who for joys brides hope to have
547,GOBLIN MARKET,Fell sick and died
548,GOBLIN MARKET,"In her gay prime,"
549,GOBLIN MARKET,In earliest Winter time
550,GOBLIN MARKET,"With the first glazing rime,"
551,GOBLIN MARKET,With the first snow-fall of crisp Winter time.
552,GOBLIN MARKET,
553,GOBLIN MARKET,Till Laura dwindling                                            320
554,GOBLIN MARKET,Seemed knocking at Death's door:
555,GOBLIN MARKET,Then Lizzie weighed no more
556,GOBLIN MARKET,Better and worse;
557,GOBLIN MARKET,"But put a silver penny in her purse,"
558,GOBLIN MARKET,"Kissed Laura, crossed the heath with clumps of furze"
559,GOBLIN MARKET,"At twilight, halted by the brook:"
560,GOBLIN MARKET,And for the first time in her life
561,GOBLIN MARKET,Began to listen and look.
562,GOBLIN MARKET,
563,GOBLIN MARKET,Laughed every goblin
564,GOBLIN MARKET,When they spied her peeping:                                      330
565,GOBLIN MARKET,"Came towards her hobbling,"
566,GOBLIN MARKET,"Flying, running, leaping,"
567,GOBLIN MARKET,"Puffing and blowing,"
568,GOBLIN MARKET,"Chuckling, clapping, crowing,"
569,GOBLIN MARKET,"Clucking and gobbling,"
570,GOBLIN MARKET,"Mopping and mowing,"
571,GOBLIN MARKET,"Full of airs and graces,"
572,GOBLIN MARKET,"Pulling wry faces,"
573,GOBLIN MARKET,"Demure grimaces,"
574,GOBLIN MARKET,"Cat-like and rat-like,                                            340"
575,GOBLIN MARKET,"Ratel- and wombat-like,"
576,GOBLIN MARKET,"Snail-paced in a hurry,"
577,GOBLIN MARKET,"Parrot-voiced and whistler,"
578,GOBLIN MARKET,"Helter skelter, hurry skurry,"
579,GOBLIN MARKET,"Chattering like magpies,"
580,GOBLIN MARKET,"Fluttering like pigeons,"
581,GOBLIN MARKET,"Gliding like fishes,--"
582,GOBLIN MARKET,Hugged her and kissed her:
583,GOBLIN MARKET,Squeezed and caressed her:
584,GOBLIN MARKET,"Stretched up their dishes,                                        350"
585,GOBLIN MARKET,"Panniers, and plates:"
586,GOBLIN MARKET,'Look at our apples
587,GOBLIN MARKET,"Russet and dun,"
588,GOBLIN MARKET,"Bob at our cherries,"
589,GOBLIN MARKET,"Bite at our peaches,"
590,GOBLIN MARKET,"Citrons and dates,"
591,GOBLIN MARKET,"Grapes for the asking,"
592,GOBLIN MARKET,Pears red with basking
593,GOBLIN MARKET,"Out in the sun,"
594,GOBLIN MARKET,Plums on their twigs;                                             360
595,GOBLIN MARKET,"Pluck them and suck them,"
596,GOBLIN MARKET,"Pomegranates, figs.'--"
597,GOBLIN MARKET,
598,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Good folk,' said Lizzie,"
599,GOBLIN MARKET,Mindful of Jeanie:
600,GOBLIN MARKET,'Give me much and many:'--
601,GOBLIN MARKET,"Held out her apron,"
602,GOBLIN MARKET,Tossed them her penny.
603,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Nay, take a seat with us,"
604,GOBLIN MARKET,"Honour and eat with us,'"
605,GOBLIN MARKET,They answered grinning:                                           370
606,GOBLIN MARKET,'Our feast is but beginning.
607,GOBLIN MARKET,"Night yet is early,"
608,GOBLIN MARKET,"Warm and dew-pearly,"
609,GOBLIN MARKET,Wakeful and starry:
610,GOBLIN MARKET,Such fruits as these
611,GOBLIN MARKET,No man can carry;
612,GOBLIN MARKET,"Half their bloom would fly,"
613,GOBLIN MARKET,"Half their dew would dry,"
614,GOBLIN MARKET,Half their flavour would pass by.
615,GOBLIN MARKET,"Sit down and feast with us,                                       380"
616,GOBLIN MARKET,"Be welcome guest with us,"
617,GOBLIN MARKET,Cheer you and rest with us.'--
618,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Thank you,' said Lizzie: 'But one waits"
619,GOBLIN MARKET,At home alone for me:
620,GOBLIN MARKET,"So without further parleying,"
621,GOBLIN MARKET,If you will not sell me any
622,GOBLIN MARKET,"Of your fruits though much and many,"
623,GOBLIN MARKET,Give me back my silver penny
624,GOBLIN MARKET,I tossed you for a fee.'--
625,GOBLIN MARKET,"They began to scratch their pates,                                390"
626,GOBLIN MARKET,"No longer wagging, purring,"
627,GOBLIN MARKET,"But visibly demurring,"
628,GOBLIN MARKET,Grunting and snarling.
629,GOBLIN MARKET,"One called her proud,"
630,GOBLIN MARKET,"Cross-grained, uncivil;"
631,GOBLIN MARKET,"Their tones waxed loud,"
632,GOBLIN MARKET,Their looks were evil.
633,GOBLIN MARKET,Lashing their tails
634,GOBLIN MARKET,"They trod and hustled her,"
635,GOBLIN MARKET,"Elbowed and jostled her,                                          400"
636,GOBLIN MARKET,"Clawed with their nails,"
637,GOBLIN MARKET,"Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,"
638,GOBLIN MARKET,"Tore her gown and soiled her stocking,"
639,GOBLIN MARKET,"Twitched her hair out by the roots,"
640,GOBLIN MARKET,"Stamped upon her tender feet,"
641,GOBLIN MARKET,Held her hands and squeezed their fruits
642,GOBLIN MARKET,Against her mouth to make her eat.
643,GOBLIN MARKET,
644,GOBLIN MARKET,"White and golden Lizzie stood,"
645,GOBLIN MARKET,"Like a lily in a flood,--"
646,GOBLIN MARKET,Like a rock of blue-veined stone                                  410
647,GOBLIN MARKET,"Lashed by tides obstreperously,--"
648,GOBLIN MARKET,Like a beacon left alone
649,GOBLIN MARKET,"In a hoary roaring sea,"
650,GOBLIN MARKET,"Sending up a golden fire,--"
651,GOBLIN MARKET,Like a fruit-crowned orange-tree
652,GOBLIN MARKET,White with blossoms honey-sweet
653,GOBLIN MARKET,"Sore beset by wasp and bee,--"
654,GOBLIN MARKET,Like a royal virgin town
655,GOBLIN MARKET,Topped with gilded dome and spire
656,GOBLIN MARKET,Close beleaguered by a fleet                                      420
657,GOBLIN MARKET,Mad to tug her standard down.
658,GOBLIN MARKET,
659,GOBLIN MARKET,"One may lead a horse to water,"
660,GOBLIN MARKET,Twenty cannot make him drink.
661,GOBLIN MARKET,"Though the goblins cuffed and caught her,"
662,GOBLIN MARKET,"Coaxed and fought her,"
663,GOBLIN MARKET,"Bullied and besought her,"
664,GOBLIN MARKET,"Scratched her, pinched her black as ink,"
665,GOBLIN MARKET,"Kicked and knocked her,"
666,GOBLIN MARKET,"Mauled and mocked her,"
667,GOBLIN MARKET,Lizzie uttered not a word;                                        430
668,GOBLIN MARKET,Would not open lip from lip
669,GOBLIN MARKET,Lest they should cram a mouthful in:
670,GOBLIN MARKET,But laughed in heart to feel the drip
671,GOBLIN MARKET,"Of juice that syrupped all her face,"
672,GOBLIN MARKET,"And lodged in dimples of her chin,"
673,GOBLIN MARKET,And streaked her neck which quaked like curd.
674,GOBLIN MARKET,"At last the evil people,"
675,GOBLIN MARKET,"Worn out by her resistance,"
676,GOBLIN MARKET,"Flung back her penny, kicked their fruit"
677,GOBLIN MARKET,"Along whichever road they took,                                   440"
678,GOBLIN MARKET,Not leaving root or stone or shoot;
679,GOBLIN MARKET,"Some writhed into the ground,"
680,GOBLIN MARKET,Some dived into the brook
681,GOBLIN MARKET,"With ring and ripple,"
682,GOBLIN MARKET,"Some scudded on the gale without a sound,"
683,GOBLIN MARKET,Some vanished in the distance.
684,GOBLIN MARKET,
685,GOBLIN MARKET,"In a smart, ache, tingle,"
686,GOBLIN MARKET,Lizzie went her way;
687,GOBLIN MARKET,Knew not was it night or day;
688,GOBLIN MARKET,"Sprang up the bank, tore thro' the furze,                         450"
689,GOBLIN MARKET,"Threaded copse and dingle,"
690,GOBLIN MARKET,And heard her penny jingle
691,GOBLIN MARKET,"Bouncing in her purse,--"
692,GOBLIN MARKET,Its bounce was music to her ear.
693,GOBLIN MARKET,She ran and ran
694,GOBLIN MARKET,As if she feared some goblin man
695,GOBLIN MARKET,Dogged her with gibe or curse
696,GOBLIN MARKET,Or something worse:
697,GOBLIN MARKET,"But not one goblin skurried after,"
698,GOBLIN MARKET,Nor was she pricked by fear;                                      460
699,GOBLIN MARKET,The kind heart made her windy-paced
700,GOBLIN MARKET,That urged her home quite out of breath with haste
701,GOBLIN MARKET,And inward laughter.
702,GOBLIN MARKET,
703,GOBLIN MARKET,"She cried 'Laura,' up the garden,"
704,GOBLIN MARKET,'Did you miss me?
705,GOBLIN MARKET,Come and kiss me.
706,GOBLIN MARKET,"Never mind my bruises,"
707,GOBLIN MARKET,"Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices"
708,GOBLIN MARKET,"Squeezed from goblin fruits for you,"
709,GOBLIN MARKET,Goblin pulp and goblin dew.                                       470
710,GOBLIN MARKET,"Eat me, drink me, love me;"
711,GOBLIN MARKET,"Laura, make much of me:"
712,GOBLIN MARKET,For your sake I have braved the glen
713,GOBLIN MARKET,And had to do with goblin merchant men.'
714,GOBLIN MARKET,
715,GOBLIN MARKET,"Laura started from her chair,"
716,GOBLIN MARKET,"Flung her arms up in the air,"
717,GOBLIN MARKET,Clutched her hair:
718,GOBLIN MARKET,"'Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted"
719,GOBLIN MARKET,For my sake the fruit forbidden?
720,GOBLIN MARKET,"Must your light like mine be hidden,                              480"
721,GOBLIN MARKET,"Your young life like mine be wasted,"
722,GOBLIN MARKET,"Undone in mine undoing,"
723,GOBLIN MARKET,"And ruined in my ruin,"
724,GOBLIN MARKET,"Thirsty, cankered, goblin-ridden?'--"
725,GOBLIN MARKET,"She clung about her sister,"
726,GOBLIN MARKET,Kissed and kissed and kissed her:
727,GOBLIN MARKET,Tears once again
728,GOBLIN MARKET,"Refreshed her shrunken eyes,"
729,GOBLIN MARKET,Dropping like rain
730,GOBLIN MARKET,After long sultry drouth;                                         490
731,GOBLIN MARKET,"Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,"
732,GOBLIN MARKET,She kissed and kissed her with a hungry mouth.
733,GOBLIN MARKET,
734,GOBLIN MARKET,"Her lips began to scorch,"
735,GOBLIN MARKET,"That juice was wormwood to her tongue,"
736,GOBLIN MARKET,She loathed the feast:
737,GOBLIN MARKET,"Writhing as one possessed she leaped and sung,"
738,GOBLIN MARKET,"Rent all her robe, and wrung"
739,GOBLIN MARKET,"Her hands in lamentable haste,"
740,GOBLIN MARKET,And beat her breast.
741,GOBLIN MARKET,Her locks streamed like the torch                                 500
742,GOBLIN MARKET,"Borne by a racer at full speed,"
743,GOBLIN MARKET,"Or like the mane of horses in their flight,"

753,GOBLIN MARKET,"Ah! fool, to choose such part"
754,GOBLIN MARKET,Of soul-consuming care!

764,GOBLIN MARKET,"Pleasure past and anguish past,"
765,GOBLIN MARKET,Is it death or is it life?
766,GOBLIN MARKET,
767,GOBLIN MARKET,Life out of death.

795,GOBLIN MARKET,Of not-returning time:

946,A TRIAD,One shamed herself in love; one temperately
947,A TRIAD,"Grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife;"
948,A TRIAD,One famished died for love. Thus two of three

1158,NOBLE SISTERS,"'I met a nameless man, sister,"
1159,NOBLE SISTERS,Hard by your chamber door:
1160,NOBLE SISTERS,I said: Her husband loves her much.
1161,NOBLE SISTERS,And yet she loves him more.'--

1369,MY DREAM,MY DREAM
1370,MY DREAM,
1371,MY DREAM,
1372,MY DREAM,Hear now a curious dream I dreamed last night
1373,MY DREAM,Each word whereof is weighed and sifted truth.
1374,MY DREAM,
1375,MY DREAM,I stood beside Euphrates while it swelled
1376,MY DREAM,Like overflowing Jordan in its youth:
1377,MY DREAM,It waxed and coloured sensibly to sight;
1378,MY DREAM,Till out of myriad pregnant waves there welled
1379,MY DREAM,"Young crocodiles, a gaunt blunt-featured crew,"
1380,MY DREAM,Fresh-hatched perhaps and daubed with birthday dew.
1381,MY DREAM,"The rest if I should tell, I fear my friend"
1382,MY DREAM,My closest friend would deem the facts untrue;                     10
1383,MY DREAM,And therefore it were wisely left untold;
1384,MY DREAM,"Yet if you will, why, hear it to the end."
1385,MY DREAM,
1386,MY DREAM,Each crocodile was girt with massive gold
1387,MY DREAM,And polished stones that with their wearers grew:
1388,MY DREAM,"But one there was who waxed beyond the rest,"
1389,MY DREAM,"Wore kinglier girdle and a kingly crown,"
1390,MY DREAM,Whilst crowns and orbs and sceptres starred his breast.
1391,MY DREAM,"All gleamed compact and green with scale on scale,"
1392,MY DREAM,But special burnishment adorned his mail
1393,MY DREAM,And special terror weighed upon his frown;                         20
1394,MY DREAM,"His punier brethren quaked before his tail,"
1395,MY DREAM,"Broad as a rafter, potent as a flail."
1396,MY DREAM,So he grew lord and master of his kin:
1397,MY DREAM,But who shall tell the tale of all their woes?
1398,MY DREAM,"An execrable appetite arose,"
1399,MY DREAM,"He battened on them, crunched, and sucked them in."
1400,MY DREAM,"He knew no law, he feared no binding law,"
1401,MY DREAM,But ground them with inexorable jaw:
1402,MY DREAM,"The luscious fat distilled upon his chin,"
1403,MY DREAM,"Exuded from his nostrils and his eyes,                             30"
1404,MY DREAM,While still like hungry death he fed his maw;
1405,MY DREAM,Till every minor crocodile being dead
1406,MY DREAM,"And buried too, himself gorged to the full,"
1407,MY DREAM,He slept with breath oppressed and unstrung claw.
1408,MY DREAM,Oh marvel passing strange which next I saw:
1409,MY DREAM,"In sleep he dwindled to the common size,"
1410,MY DREAM,And all the empire faded from his coat.
1411,MY DREAM,"Then from far off a wingèd vessel came,"
1412,MY DREAM,"Swift as a swallow, subtle as a flame:"
1413,MY DREAM,"I know not what it bore of freight or host,                        40"
1414,MY DREAM,But white it was as an avenging ghost.
1415,MY DREAM,It levelled strong Euphrates in its course;
1416,MY DREAM,Supreme yet weightless as an idle mote
1417,MY DREAM,It seemed to tame the waters without force
1418,MY DREAM,Till not a murmur swelled or billow beat:
1419,MY DREAM,"Lo, as the purple shadow swept the sands,"
1420,MY DREAM,The prudent crocodile rose on his feet
1421,MY DREAM,And shed appropriate tears and wrung his hands.
1422,MY DREAM,
1423,MY DREAM,What can it mean? you ask. I answer not
1424,MY DREAM,"For meaning, but myself must echo, What?                           50"
1425,MY DREAM,And tell it as I saw it on the spot.

1553,A SUMMER WISH,Glad soaring bird;

1555,A SUMMER WISH,To sunbeam straying by
1556,A SUMMER WISH,Or passing cloud;

1558,A SUMMER WISH,Sing thy full song aloud.
1559,A SUMMER WISH,
1560,A SUMMER WISH,Oh that it were with me
1561,A SUMMER WISH,As with the flower;
1562,A SUMMER WISH,Blooming on its own tree
1563,A SUMMER WISH,For butterfly and bee
1564,A SUMMER WISH,Its summer morns:
1565,A SUMMER WISH,That I might bloom mine hour                                     20
1566,A SUMMER WISH,A rose in spite of thorns.
1567,A SUMMER WISH,
1568,A SUMMER WISH,Oh that my work were done
1569,A SUMMER WISH,As birds' that soar

1580,AN APPLE GATHERING,
1581,AN APPLE GATHERING,
1582,AN APPLE GATHERING,I plucked pink blossoms from mine apple-tree
1583,AN APPLE GATHERING,And wore them all that evening in my hair:
1584,AN APPLE GATHERING,Then in due season when I went to see
1585,AN APPLE GATHERING,I found no apples there.
1586,AN APPLE GATHERING,
1587,AN APPLE GATHERING,With dangling basket all along the grass
1588,AN APPLE GATHERING,As I had come I went the selfsame track:
1589,AN APPLE GATHERING,My neighbours mocked me while they saw me pass
1590,AN APPLE GATHERING,So empty-handed back.
1591,AN APPLE GATHERING,
1592,AN APPLE GATHERING,"Lilian and Lilias smiled in trudging by,"
1593,AN APPLE GATHERING,Their heaped-up basket teased me like a jeer;                    10
1594,AN APPLE GATHERING,"Sweet-voiced they sang beneath the sunset sky,"
1595,AN APPLE GATHERING,Their mother's home was near.
1596,AN APPLE GATHERING,
1597,AN APPLE GATHERING,"Plump Gertrude passed me with her basket full,"
1598,AN APPLE GATHERING,A stronger hand than hers helped it along;
1599,AN APPLE GATHERING,A voice talked with her through the shadows cool
1600,AN APPLE GATHERING,More sweet to me than song.
1601,AN APPLE GATHERING,
1602,AN APPLE GATHERING,"Ah Willie, Willie, was my love less worth"
1603,AN APPLE GATHERING,Than apples with their green leaves piled above?
1604,AN APPLE GATHERING,I counted rosiest apples on the earth
1605,AN APPLE GATHERING,Of far less worth than love.                                   20
1606,AN APPLE GATHERING,
1607,AN APPLE GATHERING,So once it was with me you stooped to talk
1608,AN APPLE GATHERING,Laughing and listening in this very lane:
1609,AN APPLE GATHERING,To think that by this way we used to walk
1610,AN APPLE GATHERING,We shall not walk again!
1611,AN APPLE GATHERING,
1612,AN APPLE GATHERING,"I let my neighbours pass me, ones and twos"
1613,AN APPLE GATHERING,"And groups; the latest said the night grew chill,"
1614,AN APPLE GATHERING,"And hastened: but I loitered, while the dews"
1615,AN APPLE GATHERING,Fell fast I loitered still.

1648,MAUDE CLARE,
1649,MAUDE CLARE,'Your father thirty years ago
1650,MAUDE CLARE,Had just your tale to tell;                                      10
1651,MAUDE CLARE,"But he was not so pale as you,"
1652,MAUDE CLARE,Nor I so pale as Nell.'
1653,MAUDE CLARE,
1654,MAUDE CLARE,"My lord was pale with inward strife,"
1655,MAUDE CLARE,And Nell was pale with pride;

1673,MAUDE CLARE,
1674,MAUDE CLARE,"He strove to match her scorn with scorn,"
1675,MAUDE CLARE,He faltered in his place:                                        30
1676,MAUDE CLARE,"'Lady,' he said,--'Maude Clare,' he said,--"
1677,MAUDE CLARE,'Maude Clare:'--and hid his face.
1678,MAUDE CLARE,
1679,MAUDE CLARE,"She turn'd to Nell: 'My Lady Nell,"
1680,MAUDE CLARE,I have a gift for you;
1681,MAUDE CLARE,"Though, were it fruit, the bloom were gone,"
1682,MAUDE CLARE,"Or, were it flowers, the dew."
1683,MAUDE CLARE,
1684,MAUDE CLARE,"'Take my share of a fickle heart,"
1685,MAUDE CLARE,Mine of a paltry love:
1686,MAUDE CLARE,"Take it or leave it as you will,"
1687,MAUDE CLARE,I wash my hands thereof.'                                        40

1935,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,"I looked for that which is not, nor can be,"
1936,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,And hope deferred made my heart sick in truth:
1937,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,But years must pass before a hope of youth
1938,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,Is resigned utterly.
1939,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,
1940,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,I watched and waited with a steadfast will:
1941,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,And though the object seemed to flee away
1942,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,"That I so longed for, ever day by day"
1943,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,I watched and waited still.
1944,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,
1945,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,Sometimes I said: This thing shall be no more;
1946,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,My expectation wearies and shall cease;                          10
1947,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,I will resign it now and be at peace:
1948,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,Yet never gave it o'er.
1949,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,
1950,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,Sometimes I said: It is an empty name
1951,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,I long for; to a name why should I give
1952,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,The peace of all the days I have to live?--
1953,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,Yet gave it all the same.
1954,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,
1955,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,"Alas, thou foolish one! alike unfit"
1956,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,For healthy joy and salutary pain:
1957,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,"Thou knowest the chase useless, and again"
1958,A PAUSE OF THOUGHT,Turnest to follow it.                                          20

1966,TWILIGHT CALM,"Oh, pleasant eventide!"
1967,TWILIGHT CALM,Clouds on the western side
1968,TWILIGHT CALM,Grow grey and greyer hiding the warm sun:
1969,TWILIGHT CALM,"The bees and birds, their happy labours done,"
1970,TWILIGHT CALM,Seek their close nests and bide.
1971,TWILIGHT CALM,
1972,TWILIGHT CALM,Screened in the leafy wood
1973,TWILIGHT CALM,The stock-doves sit and brood:
1974,TWILIGHT CALM,The very squirrel leaps from bough to bough
1975,TWILIGHT CALM,But lazily; pauses; and settles now
1976,TWILIGHT CALM,Where once he stored his food.                                 10
1977,TWILIGHT CALM,
1978,TWILIGHT CALM,"One by one the flowers close,"
1979,TWILIGHT CALM,Lily and dewy rose
1980,TWILIGHT CALM,Shutting their tender petals from the moon:
1981,TWILIGHT CALM,The grasshoppers are still; but not so soon
1982,TWILIGHT CALM,Are still the noisy crows.
1983,TWILIGHT CALM,
1984,TWILIGHT CALM,The dormouse squats and eats
1985,TWILIGHT CALM,Choice little dainty bits
1986,TWILIGHT CALM,Beneath the spreading roots of a broad lime;
1987,TWILIGHT CALM,Nibbling his fill he stops from time to time
1988,TWILIGHT CALM,And listens where he sits.                                     20
1989,TWILIGHT CALM,
1990,TWILIGHT CALM,From far the lowings come
1991,TWILIGHT CALM,Of cattle driven home:
1992,TWILIGHT CALM,From farther still the wind brings fitfully
1993,TWILIGHT CALM,"The vast continual murmur of the sea,"
1994,TWILIGHT CALM,"Now loud, now almost dumb."
1995,TWILIGHT CALM,
1996,TWILIGHT CALM,"The gnats whirl in the air,"
1997,TWILIGHT CALM,The evening gnats; and there
1998,TWILIGHT CALM,The owl opes broad his eyes and wings to sail
1999,TWILIGHT CALM,For prey; the bat wakes; and the shell-less snail
2000,TWILIGHT CALM,"Comes forth, clammy and bare.                                  30"
2001,TWILIGHT CALM,
2002,TWILIGHT CALM,"Hark! that's the nightingale,"
2003,TWILIGHT CALM,Telling the selfsame tale
2004,TWILIGHT CALM,Her song told when this ancient earth was young:
2005,TWILIGHT CALM,So echoes answered when her song was sung
2006,TWILIGHT CALM,In the first wooded vale.
2007,TWILIGHT CALM,
2008,TWILIGHT CALM,We call it love and pain
2009,TWILIGHT CALM,The passion of her strain;
2010,TWILIGHT CALM,And yet we little understand or know:
2011,TWILIGHT CALM,Why should it not be rather joy that so
2012,TWILIGHT CALM,Throbs in each throbbing vein?                                 40
2013,TWILIGHT CALM,
2014,TWILIGHT CALM,In separate herds the deer
2015,TWILIGHT CALM,"Lie; here the bucks, and here"
2016,TWILIGHT CALM,"The does, and by its mother sleeps the fawn:"
2017,TWILIGHT CALM,Through all the hours of night until the dawn
2018,TWILIGHT CALM,"They sleep, forgetting fear."
2019,TWILIGHT CALM,
2020,TWILIGHT CALM,"The hare sleeps where it lies,"
2021,TWILIGHT CALM,With wary half-closed eyes;
2022,TWILIGHT CALM,"The cock has ceased to crow, the hen to cluck:"
2023,TWILIGHT CALM,"Only the fox is out, some heedless duck"
2024,TWILIGHT CALM,Or chicken to surprise.                                        50
2025,TWILIGHT CALM,
2026,TWILIGHT CALM,"Remote, each single star"
2027,TWILIGHT CALM,"Comes out, till there they are"
2028,TWILIGHT CALM,All shining brightly: how the dews fall damp!
2029,TWILIGHT CALM,While close at hand the glow-worm lights her lamp
2030,TWILIGHT CALM,Or twinkles from afar.
2031,TWILIGHT CALM,
2032,TWILIGHT CALM,But evening now is done
2033,TWILIGHT CALM,As much as if the sun
2034,TWILIGHT CALM,Day-giving had arisen in the East:
2035,TWILIGHT CALM,"For night has come; and the great calm has ceased,"
2036,TWILIGHT CALM,The quiet sands have run.                                      60

2132,SHUT OUT,The door was shut. I looked between
2133,SHUT OUT,"Its iron bars; and saw it lie,"
2134,SHUT OUT,"My garden, mine, beneath the sky,"
2135,SHUT OUT,Pied with all flowers bedewed and green:
2136,SHUT OUT,
2137,SHUT OUT,"From bough to bough the song-birds crossed,"

2143,SHUT OUT,Blank and unchanging like the grave.                             10
2144,SHUT OUT,I peering through said: 'Let me have
2145,SHUT OUT,Some buds to cheer my outcast state.'
2146,SHUT OUT,
2147,SHUT OUT,"He answered not. 'Or give me, then,"
2148,SHUT OUT,But one small twig from shrub or tree;
2149,SHUT OUT,And bid my home remember me
2150,SHUT OUT,Until I come to it again.'
2151,SHUT OUT,
2152,SHUT OUT,The spirit was silent; but he took
2153,SHUT OUT,Mortar and stone to build a wall;
2154,SHUT OUT,He left no loophole great or small

2348,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,And crocus fires are kindling one by one:
2349,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"Sing, robin, sing;"
2350,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,I still am sore in doubt concerning Spring.
2351,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
2352,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,I wonder if the springtide of this year
2353,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,Will bring another Spring both lost and dear;
2354,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"If heart and spirit will find out their Spring,"
2355,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,Or if the world alone will bud and sing:                           10
2356,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"Sing, hope, to me;"
2357,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"Sweet notes, my hope, soft notes for memory."
2358,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,
2359,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"The sap will surely quicken soon or late,"
2360,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,The tardiest bird will twitter to a mate;
2361,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"So Spring must dawn again with warmth and bloom,"
2362,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"Or in this world, or in the world to come:"
2363,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,"Sing, voice of Spring,"
2364,THE FIRST SPRING DAY,Till I too blossom and rejoice and sing.

2372,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"There's blood between us, love, my love,"
2373,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"There's father's blood, there's brother's blood;"
2374,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,And blood's a bar I cannot pass:
2375,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"I choose the stairs that mount above,"
2376,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Stair after golden skyward stair,"
2377,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,To city and to sea of glass.
2378,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"My lily feet are soiled with mud,"
2379,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,With scarlet mud which tells a tale
2380,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Of hope that was, of guilt that was,"
2381,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Of love that shall not yet avail;                                  10
2382,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Alas, my heart, if I could bare"
2383,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"My heart, this selfsame stain is there:"
2384,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,I seek the sea of glass and fire
2385,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"To wash the spot, to burn the snare;"
2386,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Lo, stairs are meant to lift us higher:"
2387,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Mount with me, mount the kindled stair."
2388,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,

2390,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"I see the far-off city grand,"
2391,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Beyond the hills a watered land,"
2392,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Beyond the gulf a gleaming strand                                  20
2393,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Of mansions where the righteous sup;
2394,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Who sleep at ease among their trees,"
2395,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Or wake to sing a cadenced hymn
2396,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,With Cherubim and Seraphim;
2397,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"They bore the Cross, they drained the cup,"
2398,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Racked, roasted, crushed, wrenched limb from limb,"
2399,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,They the offscouring of the world:
2400,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"The heaven of starry heavens unfurled,"
2401,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,The sun before their face is dim.
2402,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,
2403,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,You looking earthward what see you?                                30
2404,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Milk-white wine-flushed among the vines,"
2405,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Up and down leaping, to and fro,"
2406,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Most glad, most full, made strong with wines,"
2407,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Blooming as peaches pearled with dew,"
2408,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Their golden windy hair afloat,"
2409,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Love-music warbling in their throat,"
2410,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Young men and women come and go.
2411,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,
2412,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"You linger, yet the time is short:"
2413,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Flee for your life, gird up your strength"
2414,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,To flee; the shadows stretched at length                           40
2415,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Show that day wanes, that night draws nigh;"
2416,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Flee to the mountain, tarry not."
2417,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Is this a time for smile and sigh,"
2418,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,For songs among the secret trees
2419,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Where sudden blue birds nest and sport?
2420,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,The time is short and yet you stay:
2421,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,To-day while it is called to-day
2422,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Kneel, wrestle, knock, do violence, pray;"
2423,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"To-day is short, to-morrow nigh:"
2424,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Why will you die? why will you die?                                50
2425,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,
2426,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,You sinned with me a pleasant sin:
2427,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Repent with me, for I repent."
2428,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Woe's me the lore I must unlearn!
2429,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Woe's me that easy way we went,"
2430,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,So rugged when I would return!
2431,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"How long until my sleep begin,"
2432,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,How long shall stretch these nights and days?
2433,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Surely, clean Angels cry, she prays;"
2434,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,She laves her soul with tedious tears:
2435,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,How long must stretch these years and years?                       60
2436,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,
2437,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"I turn from you my cheeks and eyes,"
2438,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,My hair which you shall see no more--
2439,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Alas for joy that went before,"
2440,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"For joy that dies, for love that dies."
2441,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Only my lips still turn to you,"
2442,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"My livid lips that cry, Repent."
2443,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Oh weary life, oh weary Lent,"
2444,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Oh weary time whose stars are few.
2445,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,
2446,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"How should I rest in Paradise,"
2447,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Or sit on steps of heaven alone?                                   70
2448,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,If Saints and Angels spoke of love
2449,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Should I not answer from my throne:
2450,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Have pity upon me, ye my friends,"
2451,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,For I have heard the sound thereof:
2452,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Should I not turn with yearning eyes,"
2453,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Turn earthwards with a pitiful pang?
2454,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Oh save me from a pang in heaven.
2455,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"By all the gifts we took and gave,"
2456,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Repent, repent, and be forgiven:"
2457,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"This life is long, but yet it ends;                                80"
2458,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Repent and purge your soul and save:
2459,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,No gladder song the morning stars
2460,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Upon their birthday morning sang
2461,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Than Angels sing when one repents.
2462,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,
2463,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,I tell you what I dreamed last night:
2464,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,A spirit with transfigured face
2465,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Fire-footed clomb an infinite space.
2466,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"I heard his hundred pinions clang,"
2467,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Heaven-bells rejoicing rang and rang,"
2468,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Heaven-air was thrilled with subtle scents,                        90"
2469,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Worlds spun upon their rushing cars:
2470,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,He mounted shrieking: 'Give me light.'
2471,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Still light was poured on him, more light;"
2472,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Angels, Archangels he outstripped"
2473,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Exultant in exceeding might,"
2474,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,And trod the skirts of Cherubim.
2475,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Still 'Give me light,' he shrieked; and dipped"
2476,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"His thirsty face, and drank a sea,"
2477,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Athirst with thirst it could not slake.
2478,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"I saw him, drunk with knowledge, take                             100"
2479,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,From aching brows the aureole crown--
2480,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,His locks writhed like a cloven snake--
2481,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,He left his throne to grovel down
2482,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,And lick the dust of Seraphs' feet:
2483,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,For what is knowledge duly weighed?
2484,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Knowledge is strong, but love is sweet;"
2485,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Yea all the progress he had made
2486,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Was but to learn that all is small
2487,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Save love, for love is all in all."
2488,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,
2489,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,I tell you what I dreamed last night:                           110
2490,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"It was not dark, it was not light,"
2491,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Cold dews had drenched my plenteous hair
2492,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Through clay; you came to seek me there.
2493,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,And 'Do you dream of me?' you said.
2494,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,My heart was dust that used to leap
2495,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,To you; I answered half asleep:
2496,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"'My pillow is damp, my sheets are red,"
2497,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,There's a leaden tester to my bed:
2498,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Find you a warmer playfellow,"
2499,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"A warmer pillow for your head,                                    120"
2500,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,A kinder love to love than mine.'
2501,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,You wrung your hands; while I like lead
2502,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Crushed downwards through the sodden earth:
2503,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"You smote your hands but not in mirth,"
2504,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,And reeled but were not drunk with wine.
2505,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,
2506,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,For all night long I dreamed of you:
2507,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"I woke and prayed against my will,"
2508,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Then slept to dream of you again.
2509,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,At length I rose and knelt and prayed:
2510,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"I cannot write the words I said,                                  130"
2511,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"My words were slow, my tears were few;"
2512,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,But through the dark my silence spoke
2513,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Like thunder. When this morning broke,"
2514,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"My face was pinched, my hair was grey,"
2515,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,And frozen blood was on the sill
2516,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Where stifling in my struggle I lay.
2517,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,
2518,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,If now you saw me you would say:
2519,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Where is the face I used to love?
2520,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,And I would answer: Gone before;
2521,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,It tarries veiled in paradise.                                    140
2522,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"When once the morning star shall rise,"
2523,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,When earth with shadow flees away
2524,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"And we stand safe within the door,"
2525,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,Then you shall lift the veil thereof.
2526,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Look up, rise up: for far above"
2527,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,"Our palms are grown, our place is set;"
2528,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,There we shall meet as once we met
2529,THE CONVENT THRESHOLD,And love with old familiar love.

3088,A TESTIMONY,"And leaves no track, his course is brief:                          40"
3089,A TESTIMONY,Yet doth man hope and fear and plan
3090,A TESTIMONY,Till he is dead:--oh foolish man!
3091,A TESTIMONY,
3092,A TESTIMONY,Our eyes cannot be satisfied
3093,A TESTIMONY,"With seeing, nor our ears be filled"
3094,A TESTIMONY,With hearing: yet we plant and build
3095,A TESTIMONY,And buy and make our borders wide;
3096,A TESTIMONY,"We gather wealth, we gather care,"
3097,A TESTIMONY,But know not who shall be our heir.
3098,A TESTIMONY,
3099,A TESTIMONY,Why should we hasten to arise
3100,A TESTIMONY,"So early, and so late take rest?                                 50"
3101,A TESTIMONY,Our labour is not good; our best
3102,A TESTIMONY,Hopes fade; our heart is stayed on lies:
3103,A TESTIMONY,"Verily, we sow wind; and we"
3104,A TESTIMONY,"Shall reap the whirlwind, verily."
3105,A TESTIMONY,
3106,A TESTIMONY,He who hath little shall not lack;
3107,A TESTIMONY,He who hath plenty shall decay:
3108,A TESTIMONY,Our fathers went; we pass away;
3109,A TESTIMONY,Our children follow on our track:
3110,A TESTIMONY,"So generations fail, and so"
3111,A TESTIMONY,"They are renewed, and come and go.                                 60"
3112,A TESTIMONY,
3113,A TESTIMONY,The earth is fattened with our dead;
3114,A TESTIMONY,She swallows more and doth not cease:
3115,A TESTIMONY,Therefore her wine and oil increase
3116,A TESTIMONY,And her sheaves are not numberèd;
3117,A TESTIMONY,"Therefore her plants are green, and all"
3118,A TESTIMONY,Her pleasant trees lusty and tall.
3119,A TESTIMONY,
3120,A TESTIMONY,"Therefore the maidens cease to sing,"
3121,A TESTIMONY,And the young men are very sad;
3122,A TESTIMONY,"Therefore the sowing is not glad,"
3123,A TESTIMONY,And mournful is the harvesting.                                    70
3124,A TESTIMONY,"Of high and low, of great and small,"
3125,A TESTIMONY,Vanity is the lot of all.
3126,A TESTIMONY,
3127,A TESTIMONY,A King dwelt in Jerusalem;
3128,A TESTIMONY,He was the wisest man on earth;
3129,A TESTIMONY,"He had all riches from his birth,"
3130,A TESTIMONY,And pleasures till he tired of them;
3131,A TESTIMONY,"Then, having tested all things, he"
3132,A TESTIMONY,Witnessed that all are vanity.

3138,SLEEP AT SEA,
3139,SLEEP AT SEA,
3140,SLEEP AT SEA,Sound the deep waters:--
3141,SLEEP AT SEA,Who shall sound that deep?--
3142,SLEEP AT SEA,"Too short the plummet,"
3143,SLEEP AT SEA,And the watchmen sleep.
3144,SLEEP AT SEA,Some dream of effort
3145,SLEEP AT SEA,Up a toilsome steep;
3146,SLEEP AT SEA,Some dream of pasture grounds
3147,SLEEP AT SEA,For harmless sheep.
3148,SLEEP AT SEA,
3149,SLEEP AT SEA,White shapes flit to and fro
3150,SLEEP AT SEA,From mast to mast;                                               10
3151,SLEEP AT SEA,They feel the distant tempest
3152,SLEEP AT SEA,That nears them fast:
3153,SLEEP AT SEA,"Great rocks are straight ahead,"
3154,SLEEP AT SEA,Great shoals not past;
3155,SLEEP AT SEA,They shout to one another
3156,SLEEP AT SEA,Upon the blast.
3157,SLEEP AT SEA,
3158,SLEEP AT SEA,"Oh, soft the streams drop music"
3159,SLEEP AT SEA,"Between the hills,"
3160,SLEEP AT SEA,And musical the birds' nests
3161,SLEEP AT SEA,Beside those rills:                                              20
3162,SLEEP AT SEA,The nests are types of home
3163,SLEEP AT SEA,"Love-hidden from ills,"
3164,SLEEP AT SEA,The nests are types of spirits
3165,SLEEP AT SEA,Love-music fills.
3166,SLEEP AT SEA,
3167,SLEEP AT SEA,"So dream the sleepers,"
3168,SLEEP AT SEA,Each man in his place;
3169,SLEEP AT SEA,The lightning shows the smile
3170,SLEEP AT SEA,Upon each face:
3171,SLEEP AT SEA,"The ship is driving, driving,"
3172,SLEEP AT SEA,It drives apace:                                                 30
3173,SLEEP AT SEA,"And sleepers smile, and spirits"
3174,SLEEP AT SEA,Bewail their case.
3175,SLEEP AT SEA,
3176,SLEEP AT SEA,The lightning glares and reddens
3177,SLEEP AT SEA,Across the skies;
3178,SLEEP AT SEA,It seems but sunset
3179,SLEEP AT SEA,To those sleeping eyes.
3180,SLEEP AT SEA,When did the sun go down
3181,SLEEP AT SEA,On such a wise?
3182,SLEEP AT SEA,From such a sunset
3183,SLEEP AT SEA,When shall day arise?                                            40
3184,SLEEP AT SEA,
3185,SLEEP AT SEA,"'Wake,' call the spirits:"
3186,SLEEP AT SEA,But to heedless ears:
3187,SLEEP AT SEA,They have forgotten sorrows
3188,SLEEP AT SEA,And hopes and fears;
3189,SLEEP AT SEA,They have forgotten perils
3190,SLEEP AT SEA,And smiles and tears;
3191,SLEEP AT SEA,"Their dream has held them long,"
3192,SLEEP AT SEA,Long years and years.
3193,SLEEP AT SEA,
3194,SLEEP AT SEA,"'Wake,' call the spirits again:"
3195,SLEEP AT SEA,But it would take                                                50
3196,SLEEP AT SEA,A louder summons
3197,SLEEP AT SEA,To bid them awake.
3198,SLEEP AT SEA,Some dream of pleasure
3199,SLEEP AT SEA,For another's sake;
3200,SLEEP AT SEA,"Some dream, forgetful"
3201,SLEEP AT SEA,Of a lifelong ache.
3202,SLEEP AT SEA,
3203,SLEEP AT SEA,"One by one slowly,"
3204,SLEEP AT SEA,"Ah, how sad and slow!"
3205,SLEEP AT SEA,Wailing and praying
3206,SLEEP AT SEA,The spirits rise and go:                                         60
3207,SLEEP AT SEA,Clear stainless spirits
3208,SLEEP AT SEA,White as white as snow;
3209,SLEEP AT SEA,"Pale spirits, wailing"
3210,SLEEP AT SEA,For an overthrow.
3211,SLEEP AT SEA,
3212,SLEEP AT SEA,"One by one flitting,"
3213,SLEEP AT SEA,Like a mournful bird
3214,SLEEP AT SEA,Whose song is tired at last
3215,SLEEP AT SEA,For no mate is heard.
3216,SLEEP AT SEA,"The loving voice is silent,"
3217,SLEEP AT SEA,The useless word;                                                70
3218,SLEEP AT SEA,One by one flitting
3219,SLEEP AT SEA,Sick with hope deferred.
3220,SLEEP AT SEA,
3221,SLEEP AT SEA,"Driving and driving,"
3222,SLEEP AT SEA,The ship drives amain:
3223,SLEEP AT SEA,While swift from mast to mast
3224,SLEEP AT SEA,"Shapes flit again,"
3225,SLEEP AT SEA,Flit silent as the silence
3226,SLEEP AT SEA,Where men lie slain;
3227,SLEEP AT SEA,Their shadow cast upon the sails
3228,SLEEP AT SEA,Is like a stain.                                                 80
3229,SLEEP AT SEA,
3230,SLEEP AT SEA,"No voice to call the sleepers,"
3231,SLEEP AT SEA,No hand to raise:
3232,SLEEP AT SEA,"They sleep to death in dreaming,"
3233,SLEEP AT SEA,Of length of days.
3234,SLEEP AT SEA,"Vanity of vanities,"
3235,SLEEP AT SEA,The Preacher says:
3236,SLEEP AT SEA,Vanity is the end
3237,SLEEP AT SEA,Of all their ways.

3242,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,FROM HOUSE TO HOME
3243,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3244,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3245,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"The first was like a dream through summer heat,"
3246,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"The second like a tedious numbing swoon,"
3247,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,While the half-frozen pulses lagged to beat
3248,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Beneath a winter moon.
3249,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3250,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"'But,' says my friend, 'what was this thing and where?'"
3251,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,It was a pleasure-place within my soul;
3252,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,An earthly paradise supremely fair
3253,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,That lured me from the goal.
3254,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3255,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,The first part was a tissue of hugged lies;
3256,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,The second was its ruin fraught with pain:                       10
3257,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Why raise the fair delusion to the skies
3258,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,But to be dashed again?
3259,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3260,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,My castle stood of white transparent glass
3261,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Glittering and frail with many a fretted spire,"
3262,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,But when the summer sunset came to pass
3263,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,It kindled into fire.
3264,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3265,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"My pleasaunce was an undulating green,"
3266,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Stately with trees whose shadows slept below,"
3267,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,With glimpses of smooth garden-beds between
3268,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Like flame or sky or snow.                                       20
3269,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3270,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Swift squirrels on the pastures took their ease,"
3271,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,With leaping lambs safe from the unfeared knife;
3272,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,All singing-birds rejoicing in those trees
3273,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Fulfilled their careless life.
3274,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3275,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Woodpigeons cooed there, stockdoves nestled there;"
3276,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"My trees were full of songs and flowers and fruit,"
3277,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Their branches spread a city to the air
3278,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And mice lodged in their root.
3279,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3280,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"My heath lay farther off, where lizards lived"
3281,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"In strange metallic mail, just spied and gone;                   30"
3282,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Like darted lightnings here and there perceived
3283,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,But nowhere dwelt upon.
3284,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3285,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Frogs and fat toads were there to hop or plod
3286,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"And propagate in peace, an uncouth crew,"
3287,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Where velvet-headed rushes rustling nod
3288,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And spill the morning dew.
3289,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3290,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"All caterpillars throve beneath my rule,"
3291,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,With snails and slugs in corners out of sight;
3292,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,I never marred the curious sudden stool
3293,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,That perfects in a night.                                        40
3294,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3295,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Safe in his excavated gallery
3296,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,The burrowing mole groped on from year to year;
3297,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,No harmless hedgehog curled because of me
3298,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,His prickly back for fear.
3299,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3300,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Oft times one like an angel walked with me,"
3301,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"With spirit-discerning eyes like flames of fire,"
3302,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"But deep as the unfathomed endless sea,"
3303,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Fulfilling my desire:
3304,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3305,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"And sometimes like a snowdrift he was fair,"
3306,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"And sometimes like a sunset glorious red,                        50"
3307,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And sometimes he had wings to scale the air
3308,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,With aureole round his head.
3309,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3310,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"We sang our songs together by the way,"
3311,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Calls and recalls and echoes of delight;
3312,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"So communed we together all the day,"
3313,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And so in dreams by night.
3314,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3315,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,I have no words to tell what way we walked.
3316,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,What unforgotten path now closed and sealed;
3317,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"I have no words to tell all things we talked,"
3318,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,All things that he revealed:                                     60
3319,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3320,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,This only can I tell: that hour by hour
3321,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"I waxed more feastful, lifted up and glad;"
3322,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"I felt no thorn-prick when I plucked a flower,"
3323,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Felt not my friend was sad.
3324,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3325,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"'To-morrow,' once I said to him with smiles:"
3326,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"'To-night,' he answered gravely and was dumb,"
3327,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,But pointed out the stones that numbered miles
3328,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And miles to come.
3329,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3330,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"'Not so,' I said: 'to-morrow shall be sweet;"
3331,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,To-night is not so sweet as coming days.'                        70
3332,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Then first I saw that he had turned his feet,"
3333,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Had turned from me his face:
3334,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3335,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Running and flying miles and miles he went,"
3336,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,But once looked back to beckon with his hand
3337,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"And cry: 'Come home, O love, from banishment:"
3338,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Come to the distant land.'
3339,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3340,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,That night destroyed me like an avalanche;
3341,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,One night turned all my summer back to snow:
3342,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Next morning not a bird upon my branch,"
3343,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Not a lamb woke below,--                                         80"
3344,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3345,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"No bird, no lamb, no living breathing thing;"
3346,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"No squirrel scampered on my breezy lawn,"
3347,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,No mouse lodged by his hoard: all joys took wing
3348,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And fled before that dawn.
3349,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3350,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Azure and sun were starved from heaven above,"
3351,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"No dew had fallen, but biting frost lay hoar:"
3352,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"O love, I knew that I should meet my love,"
3353,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Should find my love no more.
3354,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3355,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"'My love no more,' I muttered stunned with pain:"
3356,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"I shed no tear, I wrung no passionate hand,                      90"
3357,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Till something whispered: 'You shall meet again,"
3358,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Meet in a distant land.'
3359,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3360,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Then with a cry like famine I arose,"
3361,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"I lit my candle, searched from room to room,"
3362,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Searched up and down; a war of winds that froze
3363,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Swept through the blank of gloom.
3364,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3365,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"I searched day after day, night after night;"
3366,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Scant change there came to me of night or day:
3367,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"'No more,' I wailed, 'no more:' and trimmed my light,"
3368,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"And gnashed but did not pray,                                   100"
3369,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3370,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Until my heart broke and my spirit broke:
3371,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Upon the frost-bound floor I stumbled, fell,"
3372,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And moaned: 'It is enough: withhold the stroke.
3373,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Farewell, O love, farewell.'"
3374,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3375,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Then life swooned from me. And I heard the song
3376,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Of spheres and spirits rejoicing over me:
3377,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"One cried: 'Our sister, she hath suffered long.'--"
3378,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,One answered: 'Make her see.'--
3379,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3380,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"One cried: 'Oh blessèd she who no more pain,"
3381,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Who no more disappointment shall receive.'--                    110
3382,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,One answered: 'Not so: she must live again;
3383,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Strengthen thou her to live.'
3384,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3385,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,So while I lay entranced a curtain seemed
3386,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,To shrivel with crackling from before my face;
3387,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Across mine eyes a waxing radiance beamed
3388,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And showed a certain place.
3389,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3390,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"I saw a vision of a woman, where"
3391,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Night and new morning strive for domination;
3392,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Incomparably pale, and almost fair,"
3393,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And sad beyond expression.                                      120
3394,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3395,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Her eyes were like some fire-enshrining gem,"
3396,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Were stately like the stars, and yet were tender;"
3397,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Her figure charmed me like a windy stem
3398,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Quivering and drooped and slender.
3399,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3400,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"I stood upon the outer barren ground,"
3401,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,She stood on inner ground that budded flowers;
3402,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,While circling in their never-slackening round
3403,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Danced by the mystic hours.
3404,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3405,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"But every flower was lifted on a thorn,"
3406,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And every thorn shot upright from its sands                     130
3407,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,To gall her feet; hoarse laughter pealed in scorn
3408,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,With cruel clapping hands.
3409,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3410,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"She bled and wept, yet did not shrink; her strength"
3411,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Was strung up until daybreak of delight:
3412,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"She measured measureless sorrow toward its length,"
3413,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"And breadth, and depth, and height."
3414,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3415,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Then marked I how a chain sustained her form,"
3416,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,A chain of living links not made nor riven:
3417,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"It stretched sheer up through lighting, wind, and storm,"
3418,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And anchored fast in heaven.                                    140
3419,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3420,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,One cried: 'How long? yet founded on the Rock
3421,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"She shall do battle, suffer, and attain.'--"
3422,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,One answered: 'Faith quakes in the tempest shock:
3423,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Strengthen her soul again.'
3424,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3425,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,I saw a cup sent down and come to her
3426,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Brimfull of loathing and of bitterness:
3427,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,She drank with livid lips that seemed to stir
3428,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"The depth, not make it less."
3429,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3430,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,But as she drank I spied a hand distil
3431,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,New wine and virgin honey; making it                            150
3432,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"First bitter-sweet, then sweet indeed, until"
3433,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,She tasted only sweet.
3434,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3435,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Her lips and cheeks waxed rosy-fresh and young;
3436,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Drinking she sang: 'My soul shall nothing want;'
3437,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"And drank anew: while soft a song was sung,"
3438,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,A mystical slow chant.
3439,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3440,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,One cried: 'The wounds are faithful of a friend:
3441,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,The wilderness shall blossom as a rose.'--
3442,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"One answered: 'Rend the veil, declare the end,"
3443,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Strengthen her ere she goes.'                                   160
3444,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3445,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,Then earth and heaven were rolled up like a scroll;
3446,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Time and space, change and death, had passed away;"
3447,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Weight, number, measure, each had reached its whole;"
3448,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"The day had come, that day."
3449,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,
3450,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Multitudes--multitudes--stood up in bliss,"
3451,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"Made equal to the angels, glorious, fair;"
3452,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,"With harps, palms, wedding-garments, kiss of peace"
3453,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,And crowned and haloed hair.
3454,FROM HOUSE TO HOME,

3799,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"A lifeless land, a loveless land,"
3800,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Without lair or nest on either hand:
3801,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Only scorpions jerked in the sand,"
3802,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Black as black iron, or dusty pale;"
3803,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,From point to point sheer rock was manned
3804,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,By scorpions in mail.
3805,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3806,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"A land of neither life nor death,"
3807,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Where no man buildeth or fashioneth,                              140"
3808,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Where none draws living or dying breath;
3809,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"No man cometh or goeth there,"
3810,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"No man doeth, seeketh, saith,"
3811,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,In the stagnant air.
3812,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3813,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Some old volcanic upset must
3814,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Have rent the crust and blackened the crust;
3815,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Wrenched and ribbed it beneath its dust
3816,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Above earth's molten centre at seethe,"
3817,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Heaved and heaped it by huge upthrust
3818,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Of fire beneath.                                              150
3819,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3820,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Untrodden before, untrodden since:"
3821,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Tedious land for a social Prince;
3822,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Halting, he scanned the outs and ins,"
3823,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Endless, labyrinthine, grim,"
3824,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Of the solitude that made him wince,"
3825,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Laying wait for him.
3826,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3827,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"By bulging rock and gaping cleft,"
3828,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Even of half mere daylight reft,"
3829,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Rueful he peered to right and left,"
3830,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Muttering in his altered mood:                                  160
3831,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'The fate is hard that weaves my weft,"
3832,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Though my lot be good.'
3833,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3834,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Dim the changes of day to night,"
3835,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Of night scarce dark to day not bright.
3836,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Still his road wound towards the right,"
3837,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Still he went, and still he went,"
3838,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Till one night he espied a light,"
3839,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,In his discontent.
3840,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3841,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Out it flashed from a yawn-mouthed cave,"
3842,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Like a red-hot eye from a grave.                                  170
3843,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,No man stood there of whom to crave
3844,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Rest for wayfarer plodding by:
3845,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Though the tenant were churl or knave
3846,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The Prince might try.
3847,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3848,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"In he passed and tarried not,"
3849,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Groping his way from spot to spot,"
3850,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Towards where the cavern flare glowed hot:--
3851,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"An old, old mortal, cramped and double,"
3852,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Was peering into a seething-pot,"
3853,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,In a world of trouble.                                        180
3854,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3855,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The veriest atomy he looked,"
3856,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"With grimy fingers clutching and crooked,"
3857,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Tight skin, a nose all bony and hooked,"
3858,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"And a shaking, sharp, suspicious way;"
3859,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,His blinking eyes had scarcely brooked
3860,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The light of day.
3861,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3862,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Stared the Prince, for the sight was new;"
3863,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Stared, but asked without more ado:"
3864,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'My a weary traveller lodge with you,"
3865,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Old father, here in your lair?                                  190"
3866,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"In your country the inns seem few,"
3867,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And scanty the fare.'
3868,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3869,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The head turned not to hear him speak;
3870,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The old voice whistled as through a leak
3871,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,(Out it came in a quavering squeak):
3872,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'Work for wage is a bargain fit:
3873,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,If there's aught of mine that you seek
3874,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,You must work for it.
3875,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3876,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'Buried alive from light and air
3877,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"This year is the hundredth year,                                  200"
3878,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"I feed my fire with a sleepless care,"
3879,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Watching my potion wane or wax:
3880,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Elixir of Life is simmering there,"
3881,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And but one thing lacks.
3882,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3883,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'If you're fain to lodge here with me,"
3884,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Take that pair of bellows you see--
3885,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Too heavy for my old hands they be--
3886,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Take the bellows and puff and puff:
3887,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,When the steam curls rosy and free
3888,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The broth's boiled enough.                                    210
3889,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3890,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'Then take your choice of all I have;
3891,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,I will give you life if you crave.
3892,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Already I'm mildewed for the grave,"
3893,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,So first myself I must drink my fill:
3894,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"But all the rest may be yours, to save"
3895,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Whomever you will.'
3896,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3897,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'Done,' quoth the Prince, and the bargain stood,"
3898,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"First he piled on resinous wood,"
3899,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Next plied the bellows in hopeful mood;
3900,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Thinking, 'My love and I will live.                             220"
3901,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"If I tarry, why life is good,"
3902,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And she may forgive.'
3903,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3904,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The pot began to bubble and boil;
3905,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The old man cast in essence and oil,"
3906,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,He stirred all up with a triple coil
3907,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Of gold and silver and iron wire,"
3908,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Dredged in a pinch of virgin soil,"
3909,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And fed the fire.
3910,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3911,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,But still the steam curled watery white;
3912,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Night turned to day and day to night;                             230
3913,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"One thing lacked, by his feeble sight"
3914,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Unseen, unguessed by his feeble mind:"
3915,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Life might miss him, but Death the blight"
3916,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Was sure to find.
3917,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3918,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,So when the hundredth year was full
3919,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The thread was cut and finished the school.
3920,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Death snapped the old worn-out tool,"
3921,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Snapped him short while he stood and stirred
3922,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,(Though stiff he stood as a stiff-necked mule)
3923,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,With never a word.                                            240
3924,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3925,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Thus at length the old crab was nipped.
3926,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The dead hand slipped, the dead finger dipped"
3927,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"In the broth as the dead man slipped,--"
3928,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"That same instant, a rosy red"
3929,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Flushed the steam, and quivered and clipped"
3930,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Round the dead old head.
3931,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3932,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The last ingredient was supplied
3933,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,(Unless the dead man mistook or lied).
3934,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Up started the Prince, he cast aside"
3935,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The bellows plied through the tedious trial,                    250"
3936,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Made sure that his host had died,"
3937,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And filled a phial.
3938,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3939,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'One night's rest,' though the Prince: 'This done,"
3940,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Forth I start with the rising sun:
3941,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"With the morrow I rise and run,"
3942,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Come what will of wind or of weather.
3943,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,This draught of Life when my Bride is won
3944,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,We'll drink together.'
3945,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3946,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Thus the dead man stayed in his grave,"
3947,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Self-chosen, the dead man in his cave;                            260"
3948,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"There he stayed, were he fool or knave,"
3949,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Or honest seeker who had not found:
3950,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,While the Prince outside was prompt to crave
3951,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Sleep on the ground.
3952,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3953,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'If she watches, go bid her sleep;"
3954,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Bit her sleep, for the road is steep:"
3955,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"He can sleep who holdeth her cheap,"
3956,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Sleep and wake and sleep again.
3957,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Let him sow, one day he shall reap,"
3958,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Let him sow the grain.                                        270
3959,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3960,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'When there blows a sweet garden rose,"
3961,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Let it bloom and wither if no man knows:
3962,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"But if one knows when the sweet thing blows,"
3963,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Knows, and lets it open and drop,"
3964,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,If but a nettle his garden grows
3965,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,He hath earned the crop.'
3966,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3967,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Through his sleep the summons rang,"
3968,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Into his ears it sobbed and it sang.
3969,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Slow he woke with a drowsy pang,"
3970,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Shook himself without much debate,                              280"
3971,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Turned where he saw green branches hang,"
3972,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Started though late.
3973,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3974,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"For the black land was travelled o'er,"
3975,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,He should see the grim land no more.
3976,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,A flowering country stretched before
3977,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,His face when the lovely day came back:
3978,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"He hugged the phial of Life he bore,"
3979,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And resumed his track.
3980,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3981,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"By willow courses he took his path,"
3982,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Spied what a nest the kingfisher hath,                            290"
3983,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Marked the fields green to aftermath,"
3984,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Marked where the red-brown field-mouse ran,"
3985,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Loitered a while for a deep-stream bath,"
3986,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Yawned for a fellow-man.
3987,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3988,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Up on the hills not a soul in view,"
3989,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,In a vale not many nor few;
3990,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Leaves, still leaves, and nothing new."
3991,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"It's oh for a second maiden, at least,"
3992,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"To bear the flagon, and taste it too,"
3993,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And flavour the feast.                                        300
3994,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
3995,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Lagging he moved, and apt to swerve;"
3996,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Lazy of limb, but quick of nerve."
3997,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"At length the water-bed took a curve,"
3998,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The deep river swept its bankside bare;
3999,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Waters streamed from the hill-reserve--
4000,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Waters here, waters there."
4001,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4002,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"High above, and deep below,"
4003,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Bursting, bubbling, swelling the flow,"
4004,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Like hill torrents after the snow,--"
4005,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Bubbling, gurgling, in whirling strife,                         310"
4006,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Swaying, sweeping, to and fro,--"
4007,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,He must swim for his life.
4008,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4009,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Which way?--which way?--his eyes grew dim
4010,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,With the dizzying whirl--which way to swim?
4011,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The thunderous downshoot deafened him;
4012,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Half he choked in the lashing spray:
4013,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Life is sweet, and the grave is grim--"
4014,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Which way?--which way?
4015,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4016,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"A flash of light, a shout from the strand:"
4017,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'This way--this way; here lies the land!'                         320
4018,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,His phial clutched in one drowning hand;
4019,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,He catches--misses--catches a rope;
4020,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,His feet slip on the slipping sand:
4021,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Is there life?--is there hope?
4022,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4023,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Just saved, without pulse or breath,--"
4024,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Scarcely saved from the gulp of death;
4025,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Laid where a willow shadoweth--
4026,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Laid where a swelling turf is smooth.
4027,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,(O Bride! but the Bridegroom lingereth
4028,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,For all thy sweet youth.)                                     330
4029,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4030,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Kind hands do and undo,"
4031,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Kind voices whisper and coo:
4032,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'I will chafe his hands'--'And I'--'And you
4033,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Raise his head, put his hair aside.'"
4034,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"(If many laugh, one well may rue:"
4035,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Sleep on, thou Bride.)"
4036,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4037,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,So the Prince was tended with care:
4038,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,One wrung foul ooze from his clustered hair;
4039,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Two chafed his hands, and did not spare;"
4040,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"But one held his drooping head breast-high,                     340"
4041,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Till his eyes oped, and at unaware"
4042,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,They met eye to eye.
4043,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4044,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Oh, a moon face in a shadowy place,"
4045,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"And a light touch and a winsome grace,"
4046,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And a thrilling tender voice that says:
4047,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'Safe from waters that seek the sea--
4048,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Cold waters by rugged ways--
4049,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Safe with me.'
4050,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4051,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"While overhead bird whistles to bird,"
4052,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And round about plays a gamesome herd:                            350
4053,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'Safe with us'--some take up the word--
4054,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'Safe with us, dear lord and friend:"
4055,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,All the sweeter if long deferred
4056,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Is rest in the end.'
4057,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4058,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Had he stayed to weigh and to scan,"
4059,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,He had been more or less than a man:
4060,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"He did what a young man can,"
4061,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Spoke of toil and an arduous way--
4062,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Toil to-morrow, while golden ran"
4063,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The sands of to-day.                                          360
4064,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4065,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Slip past, slip fast,"
4066,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Uncounted hours from first to last,"
4067,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Many hours till the last is past,"
4068,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Many hours dwindling to one--
4069,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"One hour whose die is cast,"
4070,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,One last hour gone.
4071,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4072,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Come, gone--gone for ever--"
4073,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Gone as an unreturning river--
4074,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Gone as to death the merriest liver--
4075,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Gone as the year at the dying fall--                            370
4076,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"To-morrow, to-day, yesterday, never--"
4077,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Gone once for all.
4078,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4079,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Came at length the starting-day,"
4080,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"With last words, and last words to say,"
4081,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,With bodiless cries from far away--
4082,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Chiding wailing voices that rang
4083,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Like a trumpet-call to the tug and fray;
4084,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And thus they sang:
4085,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4086,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'Is there life?--the lamp burns low;
4087,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Is there hope?--the coming is slow:                               380
4088,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The promise promised so long ago,"
4089,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The long promise, has not been kept."
4090,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Does she live?--does she die?--she slumbers so
4091,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Who so oft has wept.
4092,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4093,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'Does she live?--does she die?--she languisheth
4094,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"As a lily drooping to death,"
4095,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"As a drought-worn bird with failing breath,"
4096,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"As a lovely vine without a stay,"
4097,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"As a tree whereof the owner saith,"
4098,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"""Hew it down to-day.""'                                        390"
4099,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4100,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Stung by that word the Prince was fain
4101,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,To start on his tedious road again.
4102,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"He crossed the stream where a ford was plain,"
4103,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"He clomb the opposite bank though steep,"
4104,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And swore to himself to strain and attain
4105,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Ere he tasted sleep.
4106,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4107,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Huge before him a mountain frowned
4108,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"With foot of rock on the valley ground,"
4109,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"And head with snows incessant crowned,"
4110,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"And a cloud mantle about its strength,                          400"
4111,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And a path which the wild goat hath not found
4112,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,In its breadth and length.
4113,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4114,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,But he was strong to do and dare:
4115,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"If a host had withstood him there,"
4116,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,He had braved a host with little care
4117,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"In his lusty youth and his pride,"
4118,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Tough to grapple though weak to snare.
4119,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"He comes, O Bride."
4120,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4121,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Up he went where the goat scarce clings,"
4122,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Up where the eagle folds her wings,                               410"
4123,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Past the green line of living things,"
4124,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Where the sun cannot warm the cold,--"
4125,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Up he went as a flame enrings
4126,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Where there seems no hold.
4127,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4128,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Up a fissure barren and black,"
4129,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Till the eagles tired upon his track,"
4130,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"And the clouds were left behind his back,"
4131,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Up till the utmost peak was past,"
4132,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Then he gasped for breath and his strength fell slack;
4133,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,He paused at last.                                            420
4134,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4135,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Before his face a valley spread
4136,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Where fatness laughed, wine, oil, and bread,"
4137,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Where all fruit-trees their sweetness shed,"
4138,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Where all birds made love to their kind,"
4139,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Where jewels twinkled, and gold lay red"
4140,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And not hard to find.
4141,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4142,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Midway down the mountain side
4143,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,(On its green slope the path was wide)
4144,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Stood a house for a royal bride,"
4145,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Built all of changing opal stone,                               430"
4146,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The royal palace, till now descried"
4147,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,In his dreams alone.
4148,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4149,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Less bold than in days of yore,"
4150,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Doubting now though never before,"
4151,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Doubting he goes and lags the more:
4152,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Is the time late? does the day grow dim?
4153,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Rose, will she open the crimson core"
4154,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Of her heart to him?
4155,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4156,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Take heart of grace! the potion of Life
4157,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,May go far to woo him a wife:                                     440
4158,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"If she frown, yet a lover's strife"
4159,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Lightly raised can be laid again:
4160,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,A hasty word is never the knife
4161,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,To cut love in twain.
4162,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4163,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Far away stretched the royal land,"
4164,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Fed by dew, by a spice-wind fanned:"
4165,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Light labour more, and his foot would stand"
4166,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"On the threshold, all labour done;"
4167,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Easy pleasure laid at his hand,"
4168,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And the dear Bride won.                                       450
4169,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4170,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,His slackening steps pause at the gate--
4171,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Does she wake or sleep?--the time is late--
4172,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Does she sleep now, or watch and wait?"
4173,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"She has watched, she has waited long,"
4174,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Watching athwart the golden grate
4175,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,With a patient song.
4176,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4177,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Fling the golden portals wide,"
4178,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The Bridegroom comes to his promised Bride;
4179,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Draw the gold-stiff curtains aside,"
4180,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Let them look on each other's face,                             460"
4181,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"She in her meekness, he in his pride--"
4182,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Day wears apace.
4183,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4184,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Day is over, the day that wore."
4185,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"What is this that comes through the door,"
4186,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The face covered, the feet before?"
4187,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,This that coming takes his breath;
4188,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The Bride not seen, to be seen no more"
4189,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Save of Bridegroom Death?
4190,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4191,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Veiled figures carrying her
4192,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Sweep by yet make no stir;                                        470
4193,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"There is a smell of spice and myrrh,"
4194,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,A bride-chant burdened with one name;
4195,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The bride-song rises steadier
4196,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Than the torches' flame:
4197,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4198,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'Too late for love, too late for joy,"
4199,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Too late, too late!"
4200,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"You loitered on the road too long,"
4201,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,You trifled at the gate:
4202,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The enchanted dove upon her branch
4203,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Died without a mate;                                            480
4204,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The enchanted princess in her tower
4205,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Slept, died, behind the grate;"
4206,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Her heart was starving all this while
4207,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,You made it wait.
4208,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4209,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'Ten years ago, five years ago,"
4210,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"One year ago,"
4211,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Even then you had arrived in time,"
4212,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Though somewhat slow;
4213,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Then you had known her living face
4214,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Which now you cannot know:                                      490
4215,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The frozen fountain would have leaped,"
4216,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"The buds gone on to blow,"
4217,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,The warm south wind would have awaked
4218,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,To melt the snow.
4219,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4220,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'Is she fair now as she lies?
4221,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Once she was fair;
4222,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Meet queen for any kingly king,"
4223,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,With gold-dust on her hair.
4224,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Now these are poppies in her locks,"
4225,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,White poppies she must wear;                                    500
4226,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Must wear a veil to shroud her face
4227,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And the want graven there:
4228,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Or is the hunger fed at length,"
4229,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Cast off the care?
4230,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4231,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'We never saw her with a smile
4232,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Or with a frown;
4233,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Her bed seemed never soft to her,"
4234,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Though tossed of down;
4235,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"She little heeded what she wore,"
4236,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Kirtle, or wreath, or gown;                                     510"
4237,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,We think her white brows often ached
4238,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Beneath her crown,"
4239,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Till silvery hairs showed in her locks
4240,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,That used to be so brown.
4241,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4242,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,'We never heard her speak in haste;
4243,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Her tones were sweet,"
4244,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And modulated just so much
4245,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,As it was meet:
4246,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Her heart sat silent through the noise
4247,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,And concourse of the street.                                    520
4248,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"There was no hurry in her hands,"
4249,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,No hurry in her feet;
4250,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"There was no bliss drew nigh to her,"
4251,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,That she might run to greet.
4252,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4253,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"'You should have wept her yesterday,"
4254,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Wasting upon her bed:
4255,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,But wherefore should you weep to-day
4256,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,That she is dead?
4257,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Lo, we who love weep not to-day,"
4258,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,But crown her royal head.                                       530
4259,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Let be these poppies that we strew,"
4260,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Your roses are too red:
4261,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,"Let be these poppies, not for you"
4262,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,Cut down and spread.'
4263,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4264,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4265,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4266,THE PRINCE'S PROGRESS,
4267,MAIDEN-SONG,MAIDEN-SONG
4268,MAIDEN-SONG,
4269,MAIDEN-SONG,
4270,MAIDEN-SONG,"Long ago and long ago,"
4271,MAIDEN-SONG,"And long ago still,"
4272,MAIDEN-SONG,There dwelt three merry maidens
4273,MAIDEN-SONG,Upon a distant hill.
4274,MAIDEN-SONG,"One was tall Meggan,"
4275,MAIDEN-SONG,"And one was dainty May,"
4276,MAIDEN-SONG,"But one was fair Margaret,"
4277,MAIDEN-SONG,"More fair than I can say,"
4278,MAIDEN-SONG,Long ago and long ago.
4279,MAIDEN-SONG,
4280,MAIDEN-SONG,"When Meggan plucked the thorny rose,                               10"
4281,MAIDEN-SONG,"And when May pulled the brier,"
4282,MAIDEN-SONG,"Half the birds would swoop to see,"
4283,MAIDEN-SONG,Half the beasts draw nigher;
4284,MAIDEN-SONG,Half the fishes of the streams
4285,MAIDEN-SONG,Would dart up to admire:
4286,MAIDEN-SONG,"But when Margaret plucked a flag-flower,"
4287,MAIDEN-SONG,"Or poppy hot aflame,"
4288,MAIDEN-SONG,All the beasts and all the birds
4289,MAIDEN-SONG,And all the fishes came
4290,MAIDEN-SONG,To her hand more soft than snow.                                   20
4291,MAIDEN-SONG,
4292,MAIDEN-SONG,Strawberry leaves and May-dew
4293,MAIDEN-SONG,"In brisk morning air,"
4294,MAIDEN-SONG,Strawberry leaves and May-dew
4295,MAIDEN-SONG,Make maidens fair.
4296,MAIDEN-SONG,"'I go for strawberry leaves,'"
4297,MAIDEN-SONG,Meggan said one day:
4298,MAIDEN-SONG,"'Fair Margaret can bide at home,"
4299,MAIDEN-SONG,"But you come with me, May;"
4300,MAIDEN-SONG,"Up the hill and down the hill,"
4301,MAIDEN-SONG,Along the winding way                                            30
4302,MAIDEN-SONG,You and I are used to go.'
4303,MAIDEN-SONG,
4304,MAIDEN-SONG,So these two fair sisters
4305,MAIDEN-SONG,Went with innocent will
4306,MAIDEN-SONG,"Up the hill and down again,"
4307,MAIDEN-SONG,And round the homestead hill:
4308,MAIDEN-SONG,"While the fairest sat at home,"
4309,MAIDEN-SONG,"Margaret like a queen,"
4310,MAIDEN-SONG,"Like a blush-rose, like the moon"
4311,MAIDEN-SONG,"In her heavenly sheen,"
4312,MAIDEN-SONG,Fragrant-breathed as milky cow                                     40
4313,MAIDEN-SONG,"Or field of blossoming bean,"
4314,MAIDEN-SONG,Graceful as an ivy bough
4315,MAIDEN-SONG,Born to cling and lean;
4316,MAIDEN-SONG,Thus she sat to sing and sew.
4317,MAIDEN-SONG,
4318,MAIDEN-SONG,When she raised her lustrous eyes
4319,MAIDEN-SONG,A beast peeped at the door;
4320,MAIDEN-SONG,When she downward cast her eyes
4321,MAIDEN-SONG,A fish gasped on the floor;
4322,MAIDEN-SONG,When she turned away her eyes
4323,MAIDEN-SONG,"A bird perched on the sill,                                      50"
4324,MAIDEN-SONG,"Warbling out its heart of love,"
4325,MAIDEN-SONG,"Warbling warbling still,"
4326,MAIDEN-SONG,With pathetic pleadings low.
4327,MAIDEN-SONG,
4328,MAIDEN-SONG,Light-foot May with Meggan
4329,MAIDEN-SONG,"Sought the choicest spot,"
4330,MAIDEN-SONG,Clothed with thyme-alternate grass:
4331,MAIDEN-SONG,"Then, while day waxed hot,"
4332,MAIDEN-SONG,"Sat at ease to play and rest,"
4333,MAIDEN-SONG,A gracious rest and play;
4334,MAIDEN-SONG,"The loveliest maidens near or far,                                 60"
4335,MAIDEN-SONG,"When Margaret was away,"
4336,MAIDEN-SONG,Who sat at home to sing and sew.
4337,MAIDEN-SONG,
4338,MAIDEN-SONG,"Sun-glow flushed their comely cheeks,"
4339,MAIDEN-SONG,"Wind-play tossed their hair,"
4340,MAIDEN-SONG,Creeping things among the grass
4341,MAIDEN-SONG,Stroked them here and there;
4342,MAIDEN-SONG,"Meggan piped a merry note,"
4343,MAIDEN-SONG,"A fitful wayward lay,"
4344,MAIDEN-SONG,While shrill as bird on topmost twig
4345,MAIDEN-SONG,Piped merry May;                                                 70
4346,MAIDEN-SONG,Honey-smooth the double flow.
4347,MAIDEN-SONG,
4348,MAIDEN-SONG,"Sped a herdsman from the vale,"
4349,MAIDEN-SONG,"Mounting like a flame,"
4350,MAIDEN-SONG,"All on fire to hear and see,"
4351,MAIDEN-SONG,With floating locks he came.
4352,MAIDEN-SONG,"Looked neither north nor south,"
4353,MAIDEN-SONG,"Neither east nor west,"
4354,MAIDEN-SONG,But sat him down at Meggan's feet
4355,MAIDEN-SONG,"As love-bird on his nest,"
4356,MAIDEN-SONG,"And wooed her with a silent awe,                                   80"
4357,MAIDEN-SONG,With trouble not expressed;
4358,MAIDEN-SONG,"She sang the tears into his eyes,"
4359,MAIDEN-SONG,The heart out of his breast:
4360,MAIDEN-SONG,"So he loved her, listening so."
4361,MAIDEN-SONG,
4362,MAIDEN-SONG,"She sang the heart out of his breast,"
4363,MAIDEN-SONG,The words out of his tongue;
4364,MAIDEN-SONG,Hand and foot and pulse he paused
4365,MAIDEN-SONG,Till her song was sung.
4366,MAIDEN-SONG,Then he spoke up from his place
4367,MAIDEN-SONG,Simple words and true:                                           90
4368,MAIDEN-SONG,"'Scanty goods have I to give,"
4369,MAIDEN-SONG,Scanty skill to woo;
4370,MAIDEN-SONG,"But I have a will to work,"
4371,MAIDEN-SONG,And a heart for you:
4372,MAIDEN-SONG,Bid me stay or bid me go.'
4373,MAIDEN-SONG,
4374,MAIDEN-SONG,Then Meggan mused within herself:
4375,MAIDEN-SONG,"'Better be first with him,"
4376,MAIDEN-SONG,"Than dwell where fairer Margaret sits,"
4377,MAIDEN-SONG,"Who shines my brightness dim,"
4378,MAIDEN-SONG,"For ever second where she sits,                                   100"
4379,MAIDEN-SONG,However fair I be:
4380,MAIDEN-SONG,"I will be lady of his love,"
4381,MAIDEN-SONG,And he shall worship me;
4382,MAIDEN-SONG,I will be lady of his herds
4383,MAIDEN-SONG,"And stoop to his degree,"
4384,MAIDEN-SONG,At home where kids and fatlings grow.'
4385,MAIDEN-SONG,
4386,MAIDEN-SONG,Sped a shepherd from the height
4387,MAIDEN-SONG,"Headlong down to look,"
4388,MAIDEN-SONG,"(White lambs followed, lured by love"
4389,MAIDEN-SONG,Of their shepherd's crook):                                     110
4390,MAIDEN-SONG,"He turned neither east nor west,"
4391,MAIDEN-SONG,"Neither north nor south,"
4392,MAIDEN-SONG,"But knelt right down to May, for love"
4393,MAIDEN-SONG,Of her sweet-singing mouth;
4394,MAIDEN-SONG,"Forgot his flocks, his panting flocks"
4395,MAIDEN-SONG,In parching hill-side drouth;
4396,MAIDEN-SONG,Forgot himself for weal or woe.
4397,MAIDEN-SONG,
4398,MAIDEN-SONG,Trilled her song and swelled her song
4399,MAIDEN-SONG,With maiden coy caprice
4400,MAIDEN-SONG,"In a labyrinth of throbs,                                         120"
4401,MAIDEN-SONG,"Pauses, cadences;"
4402,MAIDEN-SONG,"Clear-noted as a dropping brook,"
4403,MAIDEN-SONG,"Soft-noted like the bees,"
4404,MAIDEN-SONG,Wild-noted as the shivering wind
4405,MAIDEN-SONG,Forlorn through forest trees:
4406,MAIDEN-SONG,Love-noted like the wood-pigeon
4407,MAIDEN-SONG,"Who hides herself for love,"
4408,MAIDEN-SONG,"Yet cannot keep her secret safe,"
4409,MAIDEN-SONG,But coos and coos thereof:
4410,MAIDEN-SONG,Thus the notes rang loud or low.                                  130
4411,MAIDEN-SONG,
4412,MAIDEN-SONG,He hung breathless on her breath;
4413,MAIDEN-SONG,"Speechless, who listened well;"
4414,MAIDEN-SONG,Could not speak or think or wish
4415,MAIDEN-SONG,Till silence broke the spell.
4416,MAIDEN-SONG,"Then he spoke, and spread his hands,"
4417,MAIDEN-SONG,Pointing here and there:
4418,MAIDEN-SONG,"'See my sheep and see the lambs,"
4419,MAIDEN-SONG,Twin lambs which they bare.
4420,MAIDEN-SONG,"All myself I offer you,"
4421,MAIDEN-SONG,"All my flocks and care,                                         140"
4422,MAIDEN-SONG,Your sweet song hath moved me so.'
4423,MAIDEN-SONG,
4424,MAIDEN-SONG,In her fluttered heart young May
4425,MAIDEN-SONG,Mused a dubious while:
4426,MAIDEN-SONG,'If he loves me as he says'--
4427,MAIDEN-SONG,Her lips curved with a smile:
4428,MAIDEN-SONG,'Where Margaret shines like the sun
4429,MAIDEN-SONG,I shine but like a moon;
4430,MAIDEN-SONG,If sister Meggan makes her choice
4431,MAIDEN-SONG,I can make mine as soon;
4432,MAIDEN-SONG,"At cockcrow we were sister-maids,                                 150"
4433,MAIDEN-SONG,We may be brides at noon.'
4434,MAIDEN-SONG,"Said Meggan, 'Yes;' May said not 'No.'"
4435,MAIDEN-SONG,
4436,MAIDEN-SONG,"Fair Margaret stayed alone at home,"
4437,MAIDEN-SONG,"Awhile she sang her song,"
4438,MAIDEN-SONG,"Awhile sat silent, then she thought:"
4439,MAIDEN-SONG,'My sisters loiter long.'
4440,MAIDEN-SONG,"That sultry noon had waned away,"
4441,MAIDEN-SONG,Shadows had waxen great:
4442,MAIDEN-SONG,"'Surely,' she thought within herself,"
4443,MAIDEN-SONG,'My sisters loiter late.'                                       160
4444,MAIDEN-SONG,"She rose, and peered out at the door,"
4445,MAIDEN-SONG,"With patient heart to wait,"
4446,MAIDEN-SONG,And heard a distant nightingale
4447,MAIDEN-SONG,Complaining of its mate;
4448,MAIDEN-SONG,"Then down the garden slope she walked,"
4449,MAIDEN-SONG,"Down to the garden gate,"
4450,MAIDEN-SONG,Leaned on the rail and waited so.
4451,MAIDEN-SONG,
4452,MAIDEN-SONG,The slope was lightened by her eyes
4453,MAIDEN-SONG,"Like summer lightning fair,"
4454,MAIDEN-SONG,Like rising of the haloed moon                                    170
4455,MAIDEN-SONG,"Lightened her glimmering hair,"
4456,MAIDEN-SONG,While her face lightened like the sun
4457,MAIDEN-SONG,Whose dawn is rosy white.
4458,MAIDEN-SONG,Thus crowned with maiden majesty
4459,MAIDEN-SONG,"She peered into the night,"
4460,MAIDEN-SONG,"Looked up the hill and down the hill,"
4461,MAIDEN-SONG,"To left hand and to right,"
4462,MAIDEN-SONG,Flashing like fire-flies to and fro.
4463,MAIDEN-SONG,
4464,MAIDEN-SONG,Waiting thus in weariness
4465,MAIDEN-SONG,She marked the nightingale                                      180
4466,MAIDEN-SONG,"Telling, if any one would heed,"
4467,MAIDEN-SONG,Its old complaining tale.
4468,MAIDEN-SONG,"Then lifted she her voice and sang,"
4469,MAIDEN-SONG,Answering the bird:
4470,MAIDEN-SONG,"Then lifted she her voice and sang,"
4471,MAIDEN-SONG,Such notes were never heard
4472,MAIDEN-SONG,From any bird when Spring's in blow.
4473,MAIDEN-SONG,
4474,MAIDEN-SONG,The king of all that country
4475,MAIDEN-SONG,"Coursing far, coursing near,"
4476,MAIDEN-SONG,"Curbed his amber-bitted steed,                                    190"
4477,MAIDEN-SONG,Coursed amain to hear;
4478,MAIDEN-SONG,"All his princes in his train,"
4479,MAIDEN-SONG,"Squire, and knight, and peer,"
4480,MAIDEN-SONG,"With his crown upon his head,"
4481,MAIDEN-SONG,"His sceptre in his hand,"
4482,MAIDEN-SONG,Down he fell at Margaret's knees
4483,MAIDEN-SONG,"Lord king of all that land,"
4484,MAIDEN-SONG,To her highness bending low.
4485,MAIDEN-SONG,
4486,MAIDEN-SONG,Every beast and bird and fish
4487,MAIDEN-SONG,"Came mustering to the sound,                                    200"
4488,MAIDEN-SONG,Every man and every maid
4489,MAIDEN-SONG,From miles of country round:
4490,MAIDEN-SONG,"Meggan on her herdsman's arm,"
4491,MAIDEN-SONG,"With her shepherd May,"
4492,MAIDEN-SONG,Flocks and herds trooped at their heels
4493,MAIDEN-SONG,Along the hill-side way;
4494,MAIDEN-SONG,"No foot too feeble for the ascent,"
4495,MAIDEN-SONG,Not any head too grey;
4496,MAIDEN-SONG,Some were swift and none were slow.
4497,MAIDEN-SONG,
4498,MAIDEN-SONG,So Margaret sang her sisters home                                 210
4499,MAIDEN-SONG,In their marriage mirth;
4500,MAIDEN-SONG,"Sang free birds out of the sky,"
4501,MAIDEN-SONG,"Beasts along the earth,"
4502,MAIDEN-SONG,Sang up fishes of the deep--
4503,MAIDEN-SONG,All breathing things that move
4504,MAIDEN-SONG,Sang from far and sang from near
4505,MAIDEN-SONG,To her lovely love;
4506,MAIDEN-SONG,Sang together friend and foe;
4507,MAIDEN-SONG,
4508,MAIDEN-SONG,Sang a golden-bearded king
4509,MAIDEN-SONG,"Straightway to her feet,                                        220"
4510,MAIDEN-SONG,Sang him silent where he knelt
4511,MAIDEN-SONG,In eager anguish sweet.
4512,MAIDEN-SONG,"But when the clear voice died away,"
4513,MAIDEN-SONG,"When longest echoes died,"
4514,MAIDEN-SONG,He stood up like a royal man
4515,MAIDEN-SONG,And claimed her for his bride.
4516,MAIDEN-SONG,So three maids were wooed and won
4517,MAIDEN-SONG,"In a brief May-tide,"
4518,MAIDEN-SONG,Long ago and long ago.

4525,JESSIE CAMERON,
4526,JESSIE CAMERON,"'Jessie, Jessie Cameron,"
4527,JESSIE CAMERON,"Hear me but this once,' quoth he."
4528,JESSIE CAMERON,"'Good luck go with you, neighbor's son,"
4529,JESSIE CAMERON,"But I'm no mate for you,' quoth she."
4530,JESSIE CAMERON,Day was verging toward the night
4531,JESSIE CAMERON,"There beside the moaning sea,"
4532,JESSIE CAMERON,Dimness overtook the light
4533,JESSIE CAMERON,There where the breakers be.
4534,JESSIE CAMERON,"'O Jessie, Jessie Cameron,"
4535,JESSIE CAMERON,I have loved you long and true.'--                               10
4536,JESSIE CAMERON,"'Good luck go with you, neighbor's son,"
4537,JESSIE CAMERON,But I'm no mate for you.'
4538,JESSIE CAMERON,
4539,JESSIE CAMERON,"She was a careless, fearless girl,"
4540,JESSIE CAMERON,"And made her answer plain,"
4541,JESSIE CAMERON,"Outspoken she to earl or churl,"
4542,JESSIE CAMERON,"Kindhearted in the main,"
4543,JESSIE CAMERON,"But somewhat heedless with her tongue,"
4544,JESSIE CAMERON,And apt at causing pain;
4545,JESSIE CAMERON,"A mirthful maiden she and young,"
4546,JESSIE CAMERON,Most fair for bliss or bane.                                     20
4547,JESSIE CAMERON,"'Oh, long ago I told you so,"
4548,JESSIE CAMERON,I tell you so to-day:
4549,JESSIE CAMERON,"Go you your way, and let me go"
4550,JESSIE CAMERON,Just my own free way.'
4551,JESSIE CAMERON,
4552,JESSIE CAMERON,"The sea swept in with moan and foam,"
4553,JESSIE CAMERON,Quickening the stretch of sand;
4554,JESSIE CAMERON,They stood almost in sight of home;
4555,JESSIE CAMERON,He strove to take her hand.
4556,JESSIE CAMERON,"'Oh, can't you take your answer then,"
4557,JESSIE CAMERON,And won't you understand?                                        30
4558,JESSIE CAMERON,"For me you're not the man of men,"
4559,JESSIE CAMERON,I've other plans are planned.
4560,JESSIE CAMERON,"You're good for Madge, or good for Cis,"
4561,JESSIE CAMERON,"Or good for Kate, may be:"
4562,JESSIE CAMERON,But what's to me the good of this
4563,JESSIE CAMERON,While you're not good for me?'
4564,JESSIE CAMERON,
4565,JESSIE CAMERON,"They stood together on the beach,"
4566,JESSIE CAMERON,"They two alone,"
4567,JESSIE CAMERON,"And louder waxed his urgent speech,"
4568,JESSIE CAMERON,His patience almost gone:                                        40
4569,JESSIE CAMERON,"'Oh, say but one kind word to me,"
4570,JESSIE CAMERON,"Jessie, Jessie Cameron.'--"
4571,JESSIE CAMERON,"'I'd be too proud to beg,' quoth she,"
4572,JESSIE CAMERON,And pride was in her tone.
4573,JESSIE CAMERON,"And pride was in her lifted head,"
4574,JESSIE CAMERON,And in her angry eye
4575,JESSIE CAMERON,"And in her foot, which might have fled,"
4576,JESSIE CAMERON,But would not fly.
4577,JESSIE CAMERON,
4578,JESSIE CAMERON,Some say that he had gipsy blood;
4579,JESSIE CAMERON,That in his heart was guile:                                     50
4580,JESSIE CAMERON,Yet he had gone through fire and flood
4581,JESSIE CAMERON,Only to win her smile.
4582,JESSIE CAMERON,"Some say his grandam was a witch,"
4583,JESSIE CAMERON,"A black witch from beyond the Nile,"
4584,JESSIE CAMERON,Who kept an image in a niche
4585,JESSIE CAMERON,And talked with it the while.
4586,JESSIE CAMERON,And by her hut far down the lane
4587,JESSIE CAMERON,"Some say they would not pass at night,"
4588,JESSIE CAMERON,Lest they should hear an unked strain
4589,JESSIE CAMERON,Or see an unked sight.                                           60
4590,JESSIE CAMERON,
4591,JESSIE CAMERON,"Alas, for Jessie Cameron!--"
4592,JESSIE CAMERON,"The sea crept moaning, moaning nigher:"
4593,JESSIE CAMERON,"She should have hastened to begone,--"
4594,JESSIE CAMERON,"The sea swept higher, breaking by her:"
4595,JESSIE CAMERON,She should have hastened to her home
4596,JESSIE CAMERON,"While yet the west was flushed with fire,"
4597,JESSIE CAMERON,"But now her feet are in the foam,"
4598,JESSIE CAMERON,"The sea-foam, sweeping higher."
4599,JESSIE CAMERON,"O mother, linger at your door,"
4600,JESSIE CAMERON,"And light your lamp to make it plain,                            70"
4601,JESSIE CAMERON,"But Jessie she comes home no more,"
4602,JESSIE CAMERON,No more again.
4603,JESSIE CAMERON,
4604,JESSIE CAMERON,"They stood together on the strand,"
4605,JESSIE CAMERON,"They only, each by each;"
4606,JESSIE CAMERON,"Home, her home, was close at hand,"
4607,JESSIE CAMERON,Utterly out of reach.
4608,JESSIE CAMERON,Her mother in the chimney nook
4609,JESSIE CAMERON,"Heard a startled sea-gull screech,"
4610,JESSIE CAMERON,But never turned her head to look
4611,JESSIE CAMERON,Towards the darkening beach:                                     80
4612,JESSIE CAMERON,Neighbours here and neighbours there
4613,JESSIE CAMERON,"Heard one scream, as if a bird"
4614,JESSIE CAMERON,Shrilly screaming cleft the air:--
4615,JESSIE CAMERON,That was all they heard.
4616,JESSIE CAMERON,
4617,JESSIE CAMERON,"Jessie she comes home no more,"
4618,JESSIE CAMERON,Comes home never;
4619,JESSIE CAMERON,Her lover's step sounds at his door
4620,JESSIE CAMERON,No more forever.
4621,JESSIE CAMERON,And boats may search upon the sea
4622,JESSIE CAMERON,"And search along the river,                                      90"
4623,JESSIE CAMERON,But none know where the bodies be:
4624,JESSIE CAMERON,"Sea-winds that shiver,"
4625,JESSIE CAMERON,"Sea-birds that breast the blast,"
4626,JESSIE CAMERON,"Sea-waves swelling,"
4627,JESSIE CAMERON,Keep the secret first and last
4628,JESSIE CAMERON,Of their dwelling.
4629,JESSIE CAMERON,
4630,JESSIE CAMERON,Whether the tide so hemmed them round
4631,JESSIE CAMERON,"With its pitiless flow,"
4632,JESSIE CAMERON,That when they would have gone they found
4633,JESSIE CAMERON,No way to go;                                                   100
4634,JESSIE CAMERON,Whether she scorned him to the last
4635,JESSIE CAMERON,"With words flung to and fro,"
4636,JESSIE CAMERON,"Or clung to him when hope was past,"
4637,JESSIE CAMERON,None will ever know:
4638,JESSIE CAMERON,"Whether he helped or hindered her,"
4639,JESSIE CAMERON,"Threw up his life or lost it well,"
4640,JESSIE CAMERON,"The troubled sea, for all its stir"
4641,JESSIE CAMERON,Finds no voice to tell.
4642,JESSIE CAMERON,
4643,JESSIE CAMERON,Only watchers by the dying
4644,JESSIE CAMERON,Have thought they heard one pray                                110
4645,JESSIE CAMERON,"Wordless, urgent; and replying"
4646,JESSIE CAMERON,One seem to say him nay:
4647,JESSIE CAMERON,And watchers by the dead have heard
4648,JESSIE CAMERON,"A windy swell from miles away,"
4649,JESSIE CAMERON,"With sobs and screams, but not a word"
4650,JESSIE CAMERON,Distinct for them to say:
4651,JESSIE CAMERON,And watchers out at sea have caught
4652,JESSIE CAMERON,"Glimpse of a pale gleam here or there,"
4653,JESSIE CAMERON,"Come and gone as quick as thought,"
4654,JESSIE CAMERON,Which might be hand or hair.                                    120

4755,I,"On vanity, and chose the bitter truth."
4756,I,"Harsh towards herself, towards others full of ruth,"
4757,I,"Servant of servants, little known to praise,"
4758,I,Long prayers and fasts trenched on her nights and days:
4759,I,She schooled herself to sights and sounds uncouth
4760,I,That with the poor and stricken she might make
4761,I,"A home, until the least of all sufficed                          10"
4762,I,"Her wants; her own self learned she to forsake,"

4865,TWICE,TWICE
4866,TWICE,
4867,TWICE,
4868,TWICE,I took my heart in my hand
4869,TWICE,"(O my love, O my love),"
4870,TWICE,"I said: Let me fall or stand,"
4871,TWICE,"Let me live or die,"
4872,TWICE,But this once hear me speak--
4873,TWICE,"(O my love, O my love)--"
4874,TWICE,Yet a woman's words are weak;
4875,TWICE,"You should speak, not I."
4876,TWICE,
4877,TWICE,You took my heart in your hand
4878,TWICE,"With a friendly smile,                                           10"
4879,TWICE,"With a critical eye you scanned,"
4880,TWICE,"Then set it down,"
4881,TWICE,"And said: It is still unripe,"
4882,TWICE,Better wait awhile;
4883,TWICE,"Wait while the skylarks pipe,"
4884,TWICE,Till the corn grows brown.
4885,TWICE,
4886,TWICE,As you set it down it broke--
4887,TWICE,"Broke, but I did not wince;"
4888,TWICE,"I smiled at the speech you spoke,"
4889,TWICE,At your judgement that I heard:                                  20
4890,TWICE,But I have not often smiled
4891,TWICE,"Since then, nor questioned since,"
4892,TWICE,"Nor cared for corn-flowers wild,"
4893,TWICE,Nor sung with the singing bird.
4894,TWICE,
4895,TWICE,"I take my heart in my hand,"
4896,TWICE,"O my God, O my God,"
4897,TWICE,My broken heart in my hand:
4898,TWICE,"Thou hast seen, judge Thou."
4899,TWICE,"My hope was written on sand,"
4900,TWICE,"O my God, O my God:                                              30"
4901,TWICE,Now let thy judgement stand--
4902,TWICE,"Yea, judge me now."
4903,TWICE,
4904,TWICE,"This contemned of a man,"
4905,TWICE,"This marred one heedless day,"
4906,TWICE,This heart take Thou to scan
4907,TWICE,Both within and without:
4908,TWICE,"Refine with fire its gold,"
4909,TWICE,Purge thou its dross away--
4910,TWICE,"Yea, hold it in Thy hold,"
4911,TWICE,Whence none can pluck it out.                                    40
4912,TWICE,
4913,TWICE,I take my heart in my hand--
4914,TWICE,"I shall not die, but live--"
4915,TWICE,Before Thy face I stand;
4916,TWICE,"I, for Thou callest such:"
4917,TWICE,"All that I have I bring,"
4918,TWICE,"All that I am I give,"
4919,TWICE,"Smile Thou and I shall sing,"
4920,TWICE,But shall not question much.

4928,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,A song in a cornfield
4929,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Where corn begins to fall,"

4935,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,While her sweetheart's away.
4936,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
4937,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Where is he gone to
4938,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,And why does he stay?                                            10
4939,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,He came across the green sea
4940,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"But for a day,"
4941,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Across the deep green sea
4942,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,To help with the hay.
4943,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
4944,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,His hair was curly yellow
4945,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"And his eyes were grey,"
4946,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,He laughed a merry laugh
4947,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,And said a sweet say.
4948,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Where is he gone to
4949,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,That he comes not home?                                          20
4950,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,To-day or to-morrow
4951,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,He surely will come.
4952,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Let him haste to joy
4953,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Lest he lag for sorrow,"
4954,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,For one weeps to-day
4955,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Who'll not weep to-morrow:
4956,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,To-day she must weep
4957,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"For gnawing sorrow,"
4958,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,To-night she may sleep
4959,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,And not wake to-morrow.                                          30

4961,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,May sang with Rachel
4962,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"In the waxing warm weather,"
4963,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Lettice sang with them,"
4964,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,They sang all together:--
4965,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
4966,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,'Take the wheat in your arm
4967,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Whilst day is broad above,"
4968,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Take the wheat to your bosom,"
4969,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,But not a false love.
4970,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Out in the fields
4971,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Summer heat gloweth,                                       40"
4972,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Out in the fields
4973,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Summer wind bloweth,"

4975,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Summer friend showeth,"
4976,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Out in the fields
4977,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Summer wheat groweth;
4978,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,But in the winter
4979,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,When summer heat is dead
4980,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,And summer wind has veered
4981,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"And summer friend has fled,                                  50"
4982,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Only summer wheat remaineth,"
4983,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,White cakes and bread.
4984,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Take the wheat, clasp the wheat"
4985,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,That's food for maid and dove;

4987,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,But not a false false love.'
4988,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
4989,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,A silence of full noontide heat
4990,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Grew on them at their toil:
4991,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"The farmer's dog woke up from sleep,"
4992,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,The green snake hid her coil.                                    60
4993,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Where grass stood thickest, bird and beast"
4994,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Sought shadows as they could,"
4995,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,The reaping men and women paused
4996,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,And sat down where they stood;
4997,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"They ate and drank and were refreshed,"
4998,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,For rest from toil is good.
4999,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5000,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"While the reapers took their ease,"
5001,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Their sickles lying by,"
5002,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Rachel sang a second strain,"
5003,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,And singing seemed to sigh:--                                    70
5004,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5005,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,'There goes the swallow--
5006,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Could we but follow!
5007,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Hasty swallow stay,"
5008,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Point us out the way;
5009,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Look back swallow, turn back swallow, stop swallow."
5010,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5011,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,'There went the swallow--
5012,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Too late to follow:
5013,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Lost our note of way,"
5014,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Lost our chance to-day;
5015,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Good bye swallow, sunny swallow, wise swallow.                     80"
5016,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5017,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,'After the swallow
5018,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,All sweet things follow:

5020,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Only we must stay,"
5021,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Must not follow; good bye swallow, good swallow.'"
5022,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5023,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Then listless Marian raised her head
5024,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Among the nodding sheaves;
5025,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Her voice was sweeter than that voice;
5026,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,She sang like one who grieves:
5027,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Her voice was sweeter than its wont                                90
5028,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Among the nodding sheaves;
5029,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,All wondered while they heard her sing
5030,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Like one who hopes and grieves:--
5031,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5032,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"'Deeper than the hail can smite,"

5034,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Deep asleep through day and night,"
5035,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Our delight.
5036,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5037,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"'Now thy sleep no pang can break,"
5038,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"No to-morrow bid thee wake,"
5039,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Not our sobs who sit and ache                                 100
5040,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,For thy sake.
5041,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5042,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,'Is it dark or light below?
5043,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Oh, but is it cold like snow?"
5044,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Dost thou feel the green things grow
5045,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Fast or slow?
5046,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5047,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"'Is it warm or cold beneath,"
5048,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Oh, but is it cold like death?"
5049,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"Cold like death, without a breath,"
5050,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Cold like death?'
5051,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,
5052,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,If he comes to-day                                                110
5053,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,He will find her weeping;
5054,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,If he comes to-morrow
5055,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,He will find her sleeping;
5056,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,If he comes the next day
5057,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"He'll not find her at all,"
5058,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,"He may tear his curling hair,"
5059,SONGS IN A CORNFIELD,Beat his breast and call.

5068,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Down flits the snow,"
5069,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Travelling from the frozen North
5070,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,As cold as it can blow.
5071,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Poor robin redbreast,"
5072,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Look where he comes;
5073,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Let him in to feel your fire,"
5074,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,And toss him of your crumbs.
5075,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,
5076,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,On the wind in February
5077,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Snowflakes float still,                                          10"
5078,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Half inclined to turn to rain,"
5079,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Nipping, dripping, chill."
5080,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Then the thaws swell the streams,"
5081,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,And swollen rivers swell the sea:--
5082,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,If the winter ever ends
5083,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,How pleasant it will be!
5084,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,
5085,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,In the wind of windy March
5086,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"The catkins drop down,"
5087,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Curly, caterpillar-like,"
5088,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Curious green and brown.                                         20

5090,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"And leaf-buds by the way,"
5091,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,We begin to think of flowers
5092,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,And life and nuts some day.
5093,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,
5094,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,With the gusts of April
5095,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Rich fruit-tree blossoms fall,"
5096,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"On the hedged-in orchard-green,"
5097,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,From the southern wall.
5098,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Apple-trees and pear-trees

5103,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Little brings the May breeze
5104,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Beside pure scent of flowers,"

5106,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,In lengthening daylight hours.
5107,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Across the hyacinth beds
5108,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"The wind lags warm and sweet,"

5115,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,While the first leaves drop;
5116,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,White rose and yellow rose
5117,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"And moss-rose choice to find,"

5123,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"From thunderous lightning-clouds, that blot"
5124,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Blue heaven grown lurid-pale.
5125,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Weedy waves are tossed ashore,"
5126,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Sea-things strange to sight
5127,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Gasp upon the barren shore
5128,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,And fade away in light.
5129,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,
5130,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,In the parching August wind
5131,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Corn-fields bow the head,"

5134,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Early leaves drop loitering down
5135,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Weightless on the breeze,"
5136,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,First fruits of the year's decay
5137,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,From the withering trees.
5138,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,
5139,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,In brisk wind of September
5140,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,The heavy-headed fruits
5141,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Shake upon their bending boughs
5142,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,And drop from the shoots;
5143,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Some glow golden in the sun,"
5144,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Some show green and streaked,                                    70"
5145,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Some set forth a purple bloom,"

5148,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,In strong blast of October
5149,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"At the equinox,"
5150,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Stirred up in his hollow bed
5151,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Broad ocean rocks;

5154,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"It's oh! for mothers' sons at sea,"
5155,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,That they were safe at home.                                     80
5156,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,
5157,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,In slack wind of November
5158,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,The fog forms and shifts;
5159,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,All the world comes out again
5160,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,When the fog lifts.
5161,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Loosened from their sapless twigs
5162,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,Leaves drop with every gust;
5163,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Drifting, rustling, out of sight"
5164,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,In the damp or dust.

5171,A YEAR'S WINDFALLS,"Lays the last leaves low,"

5185,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,
5186,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,"I've scanned you with a scrutinizing gaze,"
5187,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,Resolved to fathom these your secret ways:
5188,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,"But, sift them as I will,"
5189,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,Your ways are secret still.
5190,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,
5191,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,"I cut and shuffle; shuffle, cut, again;"
5192,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,"But all my cutting, shuffling, proves in vain:                     10"

5199,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,"You said, and searched the floor."
5200,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,
5201,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,I cheated once; I made a private notch
5202,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,"In Heart-Queen's back, and kept a lynx-eyed watch;"
5203,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,Yet such another back
5204,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,Deceived me in the pack:                                       20

5209,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,Misled me to my ruin.
5210,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,
5211,THE QUEEN OF HEARTS,"It baffles me to puzzle out the clue,"

5220,ONE DAY,
5221,ONE DAY,
5222,ONE DAY,I will tell you when they met:
5223,ONE DAY,In the limpid days of Spring;
5224,ONE DAY,"Elder boughs were budding yet,"
5225,ONE DAY,"Oaken boughs looked wintry still,"
5226,ONE DAY,But primrose and veined violet
5227,ONE DAY,"In the mossful turf were set,"
5228,ONE DAY,While meeting birds made haste to sing
5229,ONE DAY,And build with right good will.
5230,ONE DAY,
5231,ONE DAY,I will tell you when they parted:
5232,ONE DAY,"When plenteous Autumn sheaves were brown,                          10"
5233,ONE DAY,Then they parted heavy-hearted;
5234,ONE DAY,The full rejoicing sun looked down
5235,ONE DAY,As grand as in the days before;
5236,ONE DAY,Only they had lost a crown;
5237,ONE DAY,Only to them those days of yore
5238,ONE DAY,Could come back nevermore.
5239,ONE DAY,
5240,ONE DAY,"When shall they meet? I cannot tell,"
5241,ONE DAY,"Indeed, when they shall meet again,"
5242,ONE DAY,Except some day in Paradise:
5243,ONE DAY,"For this they wait, one waits in pain.                             20"
5244,ONE DAY,Beyond the sea of death love lies
5245,ONE DAY,"For ever, yesterday, to-day;"
5246,ONE DAY,"Angels shall ask them, 'Is it well?'"
5247,ONE DAY,"And they shall answer, 'Yea.'"

5970,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"'Men are clamouring, women, children, clamouring to be fed;"
5971,A ROYAL PRINCESS,Men like famished dogs are howling in the streets for bread.'
5972,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
5973,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"So two whispered by my door, not thinking I could hear,"
5974,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"Vulgar naked truth, ungarnished for a royal ear;"
5975,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"Fit for cooping in the background, not to stalk so near.           60"
5976,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
5977,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"But I strained my utmost sense to catch this truth, and mark:"
5978,A ROYAL PRINCESS,'There are families out grazing like cattle in the park.'
5979,A ROYAL PRINCESS,'A pair of peasants must be saved even if we build an ark.'
5980,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
5981,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"A merry jest, a merry laugh, each strolled upon his way;"
5982,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"One was my page, a lad I reared and bore with day by day;"
5983,A ROYAL PRINCESS,One was my youngest maid as sweet and white as cream in May.
5984,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
5985,A ROYAL PRINCESS,Other footsteps followed softly with a weightier tramp;
5986,A ROYAL PRINCESS,Voices said: 'Picked soldiers have been summoned from the camp
5987,A ROYAL PRINCESS,To quell these base-born ruffians who make free to howl and stamp.'
5988,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
5989,A ROYAL PRINCESS,'Howl and stamp?' one answered: 'They made free to hurl a stone    70
5990,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"At the minister's state coach, well aimed and stoutly thrown.'"
5991,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"'There's work then for the soldiers, for this rank crop must be mown.'"
5992,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
5993,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"'One I saw, a poor old fool with ashes on his head,"
5994,A ROYAL PRINCESS,Whimpering because a girl had snatched his crust of bread:
5995,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"Then he dropped; when some one raised him, it turned out he was dead.'"
5996,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
5997,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"'After us the deluge,' was retorted with a laugh:"
5998,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"'If bread's the staff of life, they must walk without a staff.'"
5999,A ROYAL PRINCESS,'While I've a loaf they're welcome to my blessing and the chaff.'
6000,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6001,A ROYAL PRINCESS,These passed. The king: stand up. Said my father with a smile:
6002,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"'Daughter mine, your mother comes to sit with you awhile,          80"
6003,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"She's sad to-day, and who but you her sadness can beguile?'"
6004,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6005,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"He too left me. Shall I touch my harp now while I wait,--"
6006,A ROYAL PRINCESS,(I hear them doubling guard below before our palace gate--)
6007,A ROYAL PRINCESS,Or shall I work the last gold stitch into my veil of state;
6008,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6009,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"Or shall my woman stand and read some unimpassioned scene,"
6010,A ROYAL PRINCESS,There's music of a lulling sort in words that pause between;
6011,A ROYAL PRINCESS,Or shall she merely fan me while I wait here for the queen?
6012,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6013,A ROYAL PRINCESS,Again I caught my father's voice in sharp word of command:
6014,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"'Charge!' a clash of steel: 'Charge again, the rebels stand."
6015,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"Smite and spare not, hand to hand; smite and spare not, hand to hand.'"
6016,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6017,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"There swelled a tumult at the gate, high voices waxing higher;     91"
6018,A ROYAL PRINCESS,A flash of red reflected light lit the cathedral spire;
6019,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"I heard a cry for faggots, then I heard a yell for fire."
6020,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6021,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"'Sit and roast there with your meat, sit and bake there with your bread,"
6022,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"You who sat to see us starve,' one shrieking woman said:"
6023,A ROYAL PRINCESS,'Sit on your throne and roast with your crown upon your head.'
6024,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6025,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"Nay, this thing will I do, while my mother tarrieth,"
6026,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"I will take my fine spun gold, but not to sew therewith,"
6027,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"I will take my gold and gems, and rainbow fan and wreath;"
6028,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6029,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"With a ransom in my lap, a king's ransom in my hand,              100"
6030,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"I will go down to this people, will stand face to face, will stand"
6031,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"Where they curse king, queen, and princess of this cursed land."
6032,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6033,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"They shall take all to buy them bread, take all I have to give;"
6034,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"I, if I perish, perish; they to-day shall eat and live;"
6035,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"I, if I perish, perish; that's the goal I half conceive:"
6036,A ROYAL PRINCESS,
6037,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"Once to speak before the world, rend bare my heart and show"
6038,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"The lesson I have learned which is death, is life, to know."
6039,A ROYAL PRINCESS,"I, if I perish, perish; in the name of God I go."

6354,A FARM WALK,Whose pleasant face and silky braid
6355,A FARM WALK,I have not yet forgotten.                                        40
6356,A FARM WALK,
6357,A FARM WALK,"Seven springs have passed since then, as I"
6358,A FARM WALK,Count with a sober sorrow;
6359,A FARM WALK,"Seven springs have come and passed me by,"
6360,A FARM WALK,And spring sets in to-morrow.
6361,A FARM WALK,
6362,A FARM WALK,I've half a mind to shake myself
6363,A FARM WALK,"Free just for once from London,"
6364,A FARM WALK,To set my work upon the shelf
6365,A FARM WALK,And leave it done or undone;
6366,A FARM WALK,
6367,A FARM WALK,"To run down by the early train,"
6368,A FARM WALK,"Whirl down with shriek and whistle,                              50"
6369,A FARM WALK,"And feel the bluff North blow again,"
6370,A FARM WALK,And mark the sprouting thistle
6371,A FARM WALK,Set up on waste patch of the lane
6372,A FARM WALK,Its green and tender bristle.
6373,A FARM WALK,
6374,A FARM WALK,"And spy the scarce-blown violet banks,"
6375,A FARM WALK,"Crisp primrose leaves and others,"
6376,A FARM WALK,And watch the lambs leap at their pranks
6377,A FARM WALK,And butt their patient mothers.
6378,A FARM WALK,
6379,A FARM WALK,"Alas, one point in all my plan"
6380,A FARM WALK,My serious thoughts demur to:                                    60
6381,A FARM WALK,"Seven years have passed for maid and man,"
6382,A FARM WALK,Seven years have passed for her too;
6383,A FARM WALK,
6384,A FARM WALK,"Perhaps my rose is overblown,"
6385,A FARM WALK,Not rosy or too rosy;
6386,A FARM WALK,Perhaps in farmhouse of her own
6387,A FARM WALK,"Some husband keeps her cosy,"
6388,A FARM WALK,Where I should show a face unknown.
6389,A FARM WALK,"Good-bye, my wayside posy."

6438,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,
6439,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"I wish you were a pleasant wren,"
6440,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,And I your small accepted mate;
6441,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,How we'd look down on toilsome men!
6442,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,We'd rise and go to bed at eight
6443,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,Or it may be not quite so late.
6444,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,
6445,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"Then you should see the nest I'd build,"
6446,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,The wondrous nest for you and me;
6447,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"The outside rough perhaps, but filled"
6448,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"With wool and down; ah, you should see"
6449,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,The cosy nest that it would be.                                  10
6450,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,
6451,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"We'd have our change of hope and fear,"
6452,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"Small quarrels, reconcilements sweet:"
6453,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"I'd perch by you to chirp and cheer,"
6454,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"Or hop about on active feet,"
6455,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,And fetch you dainty bits to eat.
6456,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,
6457,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"We'd be so happy by the day,"
6458,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"So safe and happy through the night,"
6459,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"We both should feel, and I should say,"
6460,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"It's all one season of delight,"
6461,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,And we'll make merry whilst we may.                                20
6462,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,
6463,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,Perhaps some day there'd be an egg
6464,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,When spring had blossomed from the snow:
6465,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,I'd stand triumphant on one leg;
6466,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,Like chanticleer I'd almost crow
6467,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,To let our little neighbours know.
6468,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,
6469,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,Next you should sit and I would sing
6470,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,Through lengthening days of sunny spring;
6471,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"Till, if you wearied of the task,"
6472,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,I'd sit; and you should spread your wing
6473,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,From bough to bough; I'd sit and bask.                           30
6474,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,
6475,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"Fancy the breaking of the shell,"
6476,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"The chirp, the chickens wet and bare,"
6477,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,The untried proud paternal swell;
6478,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,And you with housewife-matron air
6479,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,Enacting choicer bills of fare.
6480,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,
6481,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"Fancy the embryo coats of down,"
6482,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,The gradual feathers soft and sleek;
6483,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"Till clothed and strong from tail to crown,"
6484,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"With virgin warblings in their beak,"
6485,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,They too go forth to soar and seek.                              40
6486,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,
6487,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,So would it last an April through
6488,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,And early summer fresh with dew:
6489,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,"Then should we part and live as twain,"
6490,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,Love-time would bring me back to you
6491,CHILD'S TALK IN APRIL,And build our happy nest again.

6525,UNDER THE ROSE,'The iniquity of the fathers upon the children.'
6526,UNDER THE ROSE,
6527,UNDER THE ROSE,
6528,UNDER THE ROSE,Oh the rose of keenest thorn!
6529,UNDER THE ROSE,One hidden summer morn
6530,UNDER THE ROSE,Under the rose I was born.
6531,UNDER THE ROSE,
6532,UNDER THE ROSE,I do not guess his name
6533,UNDER THE ROSE,"Who wrought my Mother's shame,"
6534,UNDER THE ROSE,"And gave me life forlorn,"
6535,UNDER THE ROSE,"But my Mother, Mother, Mother,"
6536,UNDER THE ROSE,I know her from all other.
6537,UNDER THE ROSE,"My Mother pale and mild,"
6538,UNDER THE ROSE,"Fair as ever was seen,                                             10"
6539,UNDER THE ROSE,"She was but scarce sixteen,"
6540,UNDER THE ROSE,"Little more than a child,"
6541,UNDER THE ROSE,When I was born
6542,UNDER THE ROSE,To work her scorn.
6543,UNDER THE ROSE,"With secret bitter throes,"
6544,UNDER THE ROSE,"In a passion of secret woes,"
6545,UNDER THE ROSE,She bore me under the rose.
6546,UNDER THE ROSE,
6547,UNDER THE ROSE,One who my Mother nursed
6548,UNDER THE ROSE,Took me from the first:--
6549,UNDER THE ROSE,"'O nurse, let me look upon                                         20"
6550,UNDER THE ROSE,This babe that costs so dear;
6551,UNDER THE ROSE,To-morrow she will be gone:
6552,UNDER THE ROSE,Other mothers may keep
6553,UNDER THE ROSE,"Their babes awake and asleep,"
6554,UNDER THE ROSE,But I must not keep her here.'--
6555,UNDER THE ROSE,"Whether I know or guess,"
6556,UNDER THE ROSE,I know this not the less.
6557,UNDER THE ROSE,
6558,UNDER THE ROSE,So I was sent away
6559,UNDER THE ROSE,That none might spy the truth:
6560,UNDER THE ROSE,And my childhood waxed to youth                                    30
6561,UNDER THE ROSE,And I left off childish play.
6562,UNDER THE ROSE,I never cared to play
6563,UNDER THE ROSE,With the village boys and girls;
6564,UNDER THE ROSE,"And I think they thought me proud,"
6565,UNDER THE ROSE,I found so little to say
6566,UNDER THE ROSE,And kept so from the crowd:
6567,UNDER THE ROSE,But I had the longest curls
6568,UNDER THE ROSE,And I had the largest eyes
6569,UNDER THE ROSE,And my teeth were small like pearls;
6570,UNDER THE ROSE,"The girls might flout and scout me,                                40"
6571,UNDER THE ROSE,But the boys would hang about me
6572,UNDER THE ROSE,In sheepish mooning wise.
6573,UNDER THE ROSE,
6574,UNDER THE ROSE,Our one-street village stood
6575,UNDER THE ROSE,"A long mile from the town,"
6576,UNDER THE ROSE,A mile of windy down
6577,UNDER THE ROSE,"And bleak one-sided wood,"
6578,UNDER THE ROSE,With not a single house.
6579,UNDER THE ROSE,"Our town itself was small,"
6580,UNDER THE ROSE,"With just the common shops,"
6581,UNDER THE ROSE,And throve in its small way.                                       50
6582,UNDER THE ROSE,Our neighbouring gentry reared
6583,UNDER THE ROSE,"The good old-fashioned crops,"
6584,UNDER THE ROSE,And made old-fashioned boasts
6585,UNDER THE ROSE,Of what John Bull would do
6586,UNDER THE ROSE,"If Frenchman Frog appeared,"
6587,UNDER THE ROSE,"And drank old-fashioned toasts,"
6588,UNDER THE ROSE,And made old-fashioned bows
6589,UNDER THE ROSE,To my Lady at the Hall.
6590,UNDER THE ROSE,
6591,UNDER THE ROSE,My Lady at the Hall
6592,UNDER THE ROSE,Is grander than they all:                                          60
6593,UNDER THE ROSE,Hers is the oldest name
6594,UNDER THE ROSE,In all the neighbourhood;
6595,UNDER THE ROSE,But the race must die with her
6596,UNDER THE ROSE,"Though she's a lofty dame,"
6597,UNDER THE ROSE,For she's unmarried still.
6598,UNDER THE ROSE,Poor people say she's good
6599,UNDER THE ROSE,And has an open hand
6600,UNDER THE ROSE,"As any in the land,"
6601,UNDER THE ROSE,And she's the comforter
6602,UNDER THE ROSE,Of many sick and sad;                                              70
6603,UNDER THE ROSE,My nurse once said to me
6604,UNDER THE ROSE,That everything she had
6605,UNDER THE ROSE,Came of my Lady's bounty:
6606,UNDER THE ROSE,'Though she's greatest in the county
6607,UNDER THE ROSE,"She's humble to the poor,"
6608,UNDER THE ROSE,No beggar seeks her door
6609,UNDER THE ROSE,But finds help presently.
6610,UNDER THE ROSE,I pray both night and day
6611,UNDER THE ROSE,"For her, and you must pray:"
6612,UNDER THE ROSE,But she'll never feel distress                                     80
6613,UNDER THE ROSE,If needy folk can bless.'
6614,UNDER THE ROSE,
6615,UNDER THE ROSE,I was a little maid
6616,UNDER THE ROSE,When here we came to live
6617,UNDER THE ROSE,From somewhere by the sea.
6618,UNDER THE ROSE,Men spoke a foreign tongue
6619,UNDER THE ROSE,There where we used to be
6620,UNDER THE ROSE,"When I was merry and young,"
6621,UNDER THE ROSE,Too young to feel afraid;
6622,UNDER THE ROSE,The fisher folk would give
6623,UNDER THE ROSE,"A kind strange word to me,                                         90"
6624,UNDER THE ROSE,There by the foreign sea:
6625,UNDER THE ROSE,"I don't know where it was,"
6626,UNDER THE ROSE,But I remember still
6627,UNDER THE ROSE,"Our cottage on a hill,"
6628,UNDER THE ROSE,And fields of flowering grass
6629,UNDER THE ROSE,On that fair foreign shore.
6630,UNDER THE ROSE,
6631,UNDER THE ROSE,"I liked my old home best,"
6632,UNDER THE ROSE,But this was pleasant too:
6633,UNDER THE ROSE,So here we made our nest
6634,UNDER THE ROSE,And here I grew.                                                  100
6635,UNDER THE ROSE,And now and then my Lady
6636,UNDER THE ROSE,In riding past our door
6637,UNDER THE ROSE,"Would nod to Nurse and speak,"
6638,UNDER THE ROSE,Or stoop and pat my cheek;
6639,UNDER THE ROSE,And I was always ready
6640,UNDER THE ROSE,To hold the field-gate wide
6641,UNDER THE ROSE,For my Lady to go through;
6642,UNDER THE ROSE,My Lady in her veil
6643,UNDER THE ROSE,"So seldom put aside,"
6644,UNDER THE ROSE,My Lady grave and pale.                                           110
6645,UNDER THE ROSE,
6646,UNDER THE ROSE,I often sat to wonder
6647,UNDER THE ROSE,"Who might my parents be,"
6648,UNDER THE ROSE,For I knew of something under
6649,UNDER THE ROSE,My simple-seeming state.
6650,UNDER THE ROSE,Nurse never talked to me
6651,UNDER THE ROSE,"Of mother or of father,"
6652,UNDER THE ROSE,But watched me early and late
6653,UNDER THE ROSE,With kind suspicious cares:
6654,UNDER THE ROSE,"Or not suspicious, rather"
6655,UNDER THE ROSE,"Anxious, as if she knew                                           120"
6656,UNDER THE ROSE,Some secret I might gather
6657,UNDER THE ROSE,And smart for unawares.
6658,UNDER THE ROSE,Thus I grew.
6659,UNDER THE ROSE,
6660,UNDER THE ROSE,"But Nurse waxed old and grey,"
6661,UNDER THE ROSE,Bent and weak with years.
6662,UNDER THE ROSE,There came a certain day
6663,UNDER THE ROSE,That she lay upon her bed
6664,UNDER THE ROSE,"Shaking her palsied head,"
6665,UNDER THE ROSE,With words she gasped to say
6666,UNDER THE ROSE,Which had to stay unsaid.                                         130
6667,UNDER THE ROSE,Then with a jerking hand
6668,UNDER THE ROSE,Held out so piteously
6669,UNDER THE ROSE,She gave a ring to me
6670,UNDER THE ROSE,"Of gold wrought curiously,"
6671,UNDER THE ROSE,A ring which she had worn
6672,UNDER THE ROSE,"Since the day I was born,"
6673,UNDER THE ROSE,She once had said to me:
6674,UNDER THE ROSE,I slipped it on my finger;
6675,UNDER THE ROSE,Her eyes were keen to linger
6676,UNDER THE ROSE,On my hand that slipped it on;                                    140
6677,UNDER THE ROSE,Then she sighed one rattling sigh
6678,UNDER THE ROSE,And stared on with sightless eye:--
6679,UNDER THE ROSE,The one who loved me was gone.
6680,UNDER THE ROSE,
6681,UNDER THE ROSE,How long I stayed alone
6682,UNDER THE ROSE,"With the corpse I never knew,"
6683,UNDER THE ROSE,For I fainted dead as stone:
6684,UNDER THE ROSE,When I came to life once more
6685,UNDER THE ROSE,"I was down upon the floor,"
6686,UNDER THE ROSE,With neighbours making ado
6687,UNDER THE ROSE,To bring me back to life.                                         150
6688,UNDER THE ROSE,I heard the sexton's wife
6689,UNDER THE ROSE,"Say: 'Up, my lad, and run"
6690,UNDER THE ROSE,To tell it at the Hall;
6691,UNDER THE ROSE,"She was my Lady's nurse,"
6692,UNDER THE ROSE,And done can't be undone.
6693,UNDER THE ROSE,I'll watch by this poor lamb.
6694,UNDER THE ROSE,I guess my Lady's purse
6695,UNDER THE ROSE,Is always open to such:
6696,UNDER THE ROSE,I'd run up on my crutch
6697,UNDER THE ROSE,"A cripple as I am,'                                               160"
6698,UNDER THE ROSE,(For cramps had vexed her much)
6699,UNDER THE ROSE,'Rather than this dear heart
6700,UNDER THE ROSE,Lack one to take her part.'
6701,UNDER THE ROSE,
6702,UNDER THE ROSE,For days day after day
6703,UNDER THE ROSE,On my weary bed I lay
6704,UNDER THE ROSE,Wishing the time would pass;
6705,UNDER THE ROSE,"Oh, so wishing that I was"
6706,UNDER THE ROSE,Likely to pass away:
6707,UNDER THE ROSE,For the one friend whom I knew
6708,UNDER THE ROSE,"Was dead, I knew no other,                                        170"
6709,UNDER THE ROSE,Neither father nor mother;
6710,UNDER THE ROSE,"And I, what should I do?"
6711,UNDER THE ROSE,
6712,UNDER THE ROSE,One day the sexton's wife
6713,UNDER THE ROSE,"Said: 'Rouse yourself, my dear:"
6714,UNDER THE ROSE,My Lady has driven down
6715,UNDER THE ROSE,"From the Hall into the town,"
6716,UNDER THE ROSE,And we think she's coming here.
6717,UNDER THE ROSE,"Cheer up, for life is life.'"
6718,UNDER THE ROSE,
6719,UNDER THE ROSE,"But I would not look or speak,"
6720,UNDER THE ROSE,Would not cheer up at all.                                        180
6721,UNDER THE ROSE,"My tears were like to fall,"
6722,UNDER THE ROSE,So I turned round to the wall
6723,UNDER THE ROSE,And hid my hollow cheek
6724,UNDER THE ROSE,"Making as if I slept,"
6725,UNDER THE ROSE,"As silent as a stone,"
6726,UNDER THE ROSE,And no one knew I wept.
6727,UNDER THE ROSE,"What was my Lady to me,"
6728,UNDER THE ROSE,The grand lady from the Hall?
6729,UNDER THE ROSE,"She might come, or stay away,"
6730,UNDER THE ROSE,I was sick at heart that day:                                     190
6731,UNDER THE ROSE,The whole world seemed to be
6732,UNDER THE ROSE,"Nothing, just nothing to me,"
6733,UNDER THE ROSE,For aught that I could see.
6734,UNDER THE ROSE,
6735,UNDER THE ROSE,Yet I listened where I lay:
6736,UNDER THE ROSE,"A bustle came below,"
6737,UNDER THE ROSE,A clear voice said: 'I know;
6738,UNDER THE ROSE,"I will see her first alone,"
6739,UNDER THE ROSE,It may be less of a shock
6740,UNDER THE ROSE,If she's so weak to-day:'--
6741,UNDER THE ROSE,"A light hand turned the lock,                                     200"
6742,UNDER THE ROSE,"A light step crossed the floor,"
6743,UNDER THE ROSE,One sat beside my bed:
6744,UNDER THE ROSE,But never a word she said.
6745,UNDER THE ROSE,
6746,UNDER THE ROSE,"For me, my shyness grew"
6747,UNDER THE ROSE,Each moment more and more:
6748,UNDER THE ROSE,So I said never a word
6749,UNDER THE ROSE,And neither looked nor stirred;
6750,UNDER THE ROSE,I think she must have heard
6751,UNDER THE ROSE,My heart go pit-a-pat:
6752,UNDER THE ROSE,"Thus I lay, my Lady sat,                                          210"
6753,UNDER THE ROSE,More than a mortal hour--
6754,UNDER THE ROSE,(I counted one and two
6755,UNDER THE ROSE,By the house-clock while I lay):
6756,UNDER THE ROSE,I seemed to have no power
6757,UNDER THE ROSE,"To think of a thing to say,"
6758,UNDER THE ROSE,"Or do what I ought to do,"
6759,UNDER THE ROSE,Or rouse myself to a choice.
6760,UNDER THE ROSE,
6761,UNDER THE ROSE,"At last she said: 'Margaret,"
6762,UNDER THE ROSE,Won't you even look at me?'
6763,UNDER THE ROSE,A something in her voice                                          220
6764,UNDER THE ROSE,"Forced my tears to fall at last,"
6765,UNDER THE ROSE,Forced sobs from me thick and fast;
6766,UNDER THE ROSE,"Something not of the past,"
6767,UNDER THE ROSE,Yet stirring memory;
6768,UNDER THE ROSE,"A something new, and yet"
6769,UNDER THE ROSE,"Not new, too sweet to last,"
6770,UNDER THE ROSE,Which I never can forget.
6771,UNDER THE ROSE,
6772,UNDER THE ROSE,I turned and stared at her:
6773,UNDER THE ROSE,Her cheek showed hollow-pale;
6774,UNDER THE ROSE,"Her hair like mine was fair,                                      230"
6775,UNDER THE ROSE,A wonderful fall of hair
6776,UNDER THE ROSE,That screened her like a veil;
6777,UNDER THE ROSE,"But her height was statelier,"
6778,UNDER THE ROSE,Her eyes had depth more deep;
6779,UNDER THE ROSE,I think they must have had
6780,UNDER THE ROSE,"Always a something sad,"
6781,UNDER THE ROSE,Unless they were asleep.
6782,UNDER THE ROSE,
6783,UNDER THE ROSE,"While I stared, my Lady took"
6784,UNDER THE ROSE,My hand in her spare hand
6785,UNDER THE ROSE,"Jewelled and soft and grand,                                      240"
6786,UNDER THE ROSE,And looked with a long long look
6787,UNDER THE ROSE,Of hunger in my face;
6788,UNDER THE ROSE,As if she tried to trace
6789,UNDER THE ROSE,"Features she ought to know,"
6790,UNDER THE ROSE,"And half hoped, half feared, to find."
6791,UNDER THE ROSE,Whatever was in her mind
6792,UNDER THE ROSE,"She heaved a sigh at last,"
6793,UNDER THE ROSE,And began to talk to me.
6794,UNDER THE ROSE,
6795,UNDER THE ROSE,"'Your nurse was my dear nurse,"
6796,UNDER THE ROSE,"And her nursling's dear,' said she:                               250"
6797,UNDER THE ROSE,'I never knew that she was worse
6798,UNDER THE ROSE,Till her poor life was past'
6799,UNDER THE ROSE,(Here my Lady's tears dropped fast):
6800,UNDER THE ROSE,"'I might have been with her,"
6801,UNDER THE ROSE,But she had no comforter.
6802,UNDER THE ROSE,She might have told me much
6803,UNDER THE ROSE,"Which now I shall never know,"
6804,UNDER THE ROSE,Never never shall know.'
6805,UNDER THE ROSE,"She sat by me sobbing so,"
6806,UNDER THE ROSE,"And seemed so woe-begone,                                         260"
6807,UNDER THE ROSE,That I laid one hand upon
6808,UNDER THE ROSE,"Hers with a timid touch,"
6809,UNDER THE ROSE,"Scarce thinking what I did,"
6810,UNDER THE ROSE,Not knowing what to say:
6811,UNDER THE ROSE,That moment her face was hid
6812,UNDER THE ROSE,"In the pillow close by mine,"
6813,UNDER THE ROSE,"Her arm was flung over me,"
6814,UNDER THE ROSE,"She hugged me, sobbing so"
6815,UNDER THE ROSE,"As if her heart would break,"
6816,UNDER THE ROSE,And kissed me where I lay.                                        270
6817,UNDER THE ROSE,
6818,UNDER THE ROSE,After this she often came
6819,UNDER THE ROSE,"To bring me fruit or wine,"
6820,UNDER THE ROSE,Or sometimes hothouse flowers.
6821,UNDER THE ROSE,And at nights I lay awake
6822,UNDER THE ROSE,Often and often thinking
6823,UNDER THE ROSE,What to do for her sake.
6824,UNDER THE ROSE,Wet or dry it was the same:
6825,UNDER THE ROSE,"She would come in at all hours,"
6826,UNDER THE ROSE,Set me eating and drinking
6827,UNDER THE ROSE,And say I must grow strong;                                       280
6828,UNDER THE ROSE,At last the day seemed long
6829,UNDER THE ROSE,And home seemed scarcely home
6830,UNDER THE ROSE,If she did not come.
6831,UNDER THE ROSE,
6832,UNDER THE ROSE,"Well, I grew strong again:"
6833,UNDER THE ROSE,"In time of primroses,"
6834,UNDER THE ROSE,I went to pluck them in the lane;
6835,UNDER THE ROSE,"In time of nestling birds,"
6836,UNDER THE ROSE,I heard them chirping round the house;
6837,UNDER THE ROSE,And all the herds
6838,UNDER THE ROSE,"Were out at grass when I grew strong,                             290"
6839,UNDER THE ROSE,"And days were waxen long,"
6840,UNDER THE ROSE,And there was work for bees
6841,UNDER THE ROSE,"Among the May-bush boughs,"
6842,UNDER THE ROSE,"And I had shot up tall,"
6843,UNDER THE ROSE,And life felt after all
6844,UNDER THE ROSE,"Pleasant, and not so long"
6845,UNDER THE ROSE,When I grew strong.
6846,UNDER THE ROSE,
6847,UNDER THE ROSE,I was going to the Hall
6848,UNDER THE ROSE,To be my Lady's maid:
6849,UNDER THE ROSE,"'Her little friend,' she said to me,                              300"
6850,UNDER THE ROSE,"'Almost her child,'"
6851,UNDER THE ROSE,She said and smiled
6852,UNDER THE ROSE,Sighing painfully;
6853,UNDER THE ROSE,"Blushing, with a second flush"
6854,UNDER THE ROSE,As if she blushed to blush.
6855,UNDER THE ROSE,
6856,UNDER THE ROSE,"Friend, servant, child: just this"
6857,UNDER THE ROSE,My standing at the Hall;
6858,UNDER THE ROSE,"The other servants call me 'Miss,'"
6859,UNDER THE ROSE,"My Lady calls me 'Margaret,'"
6860,UNDER THE ROSE,With her clear voice musical.                                     310
6861,UNDER THE ROSE,She never chides when I forget
6862,UNDER THE ROSE,This or that; she never chides.
6863,UNDER THE ROSE,"Except when people come to stay,"
6864,UNDER THE ROSE,"(And that's not often) at the Hall,"
6865,UNDER THE ROSE,I sit with her all day
6866,UNDER THE ROSE,And ride out when she rides.
6867,UNDER THE ROSE,She sings to me and makes me sing;
6868,UNDER THE ROSE,"Sometimes I read to her,"
6869,UNDER THE ROSE,Sometimes we merely sit and talk.
6870,UNDER THE ROSE,She noticed once my ring                                          320
6871,UNDER THE ROSE,And made me tell its history:
6872,UNDER THE ROSE,That evening in our garden walk
6873,UNDER THE ROSE,She said she should infer
6874,UNDER THE ROSE,"The ring had been my father's first,"
6875,UNDER THE ROSE,"Then my mother's, given for me"
6876,UNDER THE ROSE,To the nurse who nursed
6877,UNDER THE ROSE,"My mother in her misery,"
6878,UNDER THE ROSE,That so quite certainly
6879,UNDER THE ROSE,"Some one might know me, who..."
6880,UNDER THE ROSE,"Then she was silent, and I too.                                   330"
6881,UNDER THE ROSE,
6882,UNDER THE ROSE,I hate when people come:
6883,UNDER THE ROSE,The women speak and stare
6884,UNDER THE ROSE,And mean to be so civil.
6885,UNDER THE ROSE,"This one will stroke my hair,"
6886,UNDER THE ROSE,That one will pat my cheek
6887,UNDER THE ROSE,"And praise my Lady's kindness,"
6888,UNDER THE ROSE,Expecting me to speak;
6889,UNDER THE ROSE,I like the proud ones best
6890,UNDER THE ROSE,"Who sit as struck with blindness,"
6891,UNDER THE ROSE,As if I wasn't there.                                             340
6892,UNDER THE ROSE,But if any gentleman
6893,UNDER THE ROSE,Is staying at the Hall
6894,UNDER THE ROSE,"(Though few come prying here),"
6895,UNDER THE ROSE,My Lady seems to fear
6896,UNDER THE ROSE,"Some downright dreadful evil,"
6897,UNDER THE ROSE,And makes me keep my room
6898,UNDER THE ROSE,As closely as she can:
6899,UNDER THE ROSE,"So I hate when people come,"
6900,UNDER THE ROSE,It is so troublesome.
6901,UNDER THE ROSE,"In spite of all her care,                                         350"
6902,UNDER THE ROSE,Sometimes to keep alive
6903,UNDER THE ROSE,I sometimes do contrive
6904,UNDER THE ROSE,To get out in the grounds
6905,UNDER THE ROSE,"For a whiff of wholesome air,"
6906,UNDER THE ROSE,Under the rose you know:
6907,UNDER THE ROSE,"It's charming to break bounds,"
6908,UNDER THE ROSE,"Stolen waters are sweet,"
6909,UNDER THE ROSE,And what's the good of feet
6910,UNDER THE ROSE,If for days they mustn't go?
6911,UNDER THE ROSE,"Give me a longer tether,                                          360"
6912,UNDER THE ROSE,Or I may break from it.
6913,UNDER THE ROSE,
6914,UNDER THE ROSE,Now I have eyes and ears
6915,UNDER THE ROSE,And just some little wit:
6916,UNDER THE ROSE,'Almost my Lady's child;'
6917,UNDER THE ROSE,"I recollect she smiled,"
6918,UNDER THE ROSE,Sighed and blushed together;
6919,UNDER THE ROSE,Then her story of the ring
6920,UNDER THE ROSE,"Sounds not improbable,"
6921,UNDER THE ROSE,She told it me so well
6922,UNDER THE ROSE,It seemed the actual thing:--                                     370
6923,UNDER THE ROSE,"Oh, keep your counsel close,"
6924,UNDER THE ROSE,"But I guess under the rose,"
6925,UNDER THE ROSE,In long past summer weather
6926,UNDER THE ROSE,"When the world was blossoming,"
6927,UNDER THE ROSE,And the rose upon its thorn:
6928,UNDER THE ROSE,I guess not who he was
6929,UNDER THE ROSE,"Flawed honour like a glass,"
6930,UNDER THE ROSE,"And made my life forlorn,"
6931,UNDER THE ROSE,"But my Mother, Mother, Mother,"
6932,UNDER THE ROSE,"Oh, I know her from all other.                                    380"
6933,UNDER THE ROSE,
6934,UNDER THE ROSE,"My Lady, you might trust"
6935,UNDER THE ROSE,Your daughter with your fame.
6936,UNDER THE ROSE,"Trust me, I would not shame"
6937,UNDER THE ROSE,"Our honourable name,"
6938,UNDER THE ROSE,For I have noble blood
6939,UNDER THE ROSE,Though I was bred in dust
6940,UNDER THE ROSE,And brought up in the mud.
6941,UNDER THE ROSE,"I will not press my claim,"
6942,UNDER THE ROSE,Just leave me where you will:
6943,UNDER THE ROSE,"But you might trust your daughter,                                390"
6944,UNDER THE ROSE,For blood is thicker than water
6945,UNDER THE ROSE,And you're my mother still.
6946,UNDER THE ROSE,
6947,UNDER THE ROSE,So my Lady holds her own
6948,UNDER THE ROSE,"With condescending grace,"
6949,UNDER THE ROSE,and fills her lofty place
6950,UNDER THE ROSE,With an untroubled face
6951,UNDER THE ROSE,As a queen may fill a throne.
6952,UNDER THE ROSE,While I could hint a tale--
6953,UNDER THE ROSE,(But then I am her child)--
6954,UNDER THE ROSE,Would make her quail;                                             400
6955,UNDER THE ROSE,"Would set her in the dust,"
6956,UNDER THE ROSE,"Lorn with no comforter,"
6957,UNDER THE ROSE,Her glorious hair defiled
6958,UNDER THE ROSE,And ashes on her cheek:
6959,UNDER THE ROSE,The decent world would thrust
6960,UNDER THE ROSE,"Its finger out at her,"
6961,UNDER THE ROSE,Not much displeased I think
6962,UNDER THE ROSE,To make a nine days' stir;
6963,UNDER THE ROSE,The decent world would sink
6964,UNDER THE ROSE,Its voice to speak of her.                                        410
6965,UNDER THE ROSE,
6966,UNDER THE ROSE,Now this is what I mean
6967,UNDER THE ROSE,"To do, no more, no less:"
6968,UNDER THE ROSE,"Never to speak, or show"
6969,UNDER THE ROSE,Bare sign of what I know.
6970,UNDER THE ROSE,Let the blot pass unseen;
6971,UNDER THE ROSE,"Yea, let her never guess"
6972,UNDER THE ROSE,I hold the tangled clue
6973,UNDER THE ROSE,She huddles out of view.
6974,UNDER THE ROSE,"Friend, servant, almost child,"
6975,UNDER THE ROSE,So be it and nothing more                                         420
6976,UNDER THE ROSE,On this side of the grave.
6977,UNDER THE ROSE,"Mother, in Paradise,"
6978,UNDER THE ROSE,You'll see with clearer eyes;
6979,UNDER THE ROSE,Perhaps in this world even
6980,UNDER THE ROSE,When you are like to die
6981,UNDER THE ROSE,And face to face with Heaven
6982,UNDER THE ROSE,You'll drop for once the lie:
6983,UNDER THE ROSE,"But you must drop the mask, not I."
6984,UNDER THE ROSE,
6985,UNDER THE ROSE,My Lady promises
6986,UNDER THE ROSE,Two hundred pounds with me                                        430
6987,UNDER THE ROSE,Whenever I may wed
6988,UNDER THE ROSE,A man she can approve:
6989,UNDER THE ROSE,And since besides her bounty
6990,UNDER THE ROSE,I'm fairest in the county
6991,UNDER THE ROSE,"(For so I've heard it said,"
6992,UNDER THE ROSE,"Though I don't vouch for this),"
6993,UNDER THE ROSE,Her promised pounds may move
6994,UNDER THE ROSE,Some honest man to see
6995,UNDER THE ROSE,My virtues and my beauties;
6996,UNDER THE ROSE,"Perhaps the rising grazier,                                       440"
6997,UNDER THE ROSE,"Or temperance publican,"
6998,UNDER THE ROSE,May claim my wifely duties.
6999,UNDER THE ROSE,Meanwhile I wait their leisure
7000,UNDER THE ROSE,"And grace-bestowing pleasure,"
7001,UNDER THE ROSE,I wait the happy man;
7002,UNDER THE ROSE,But if I hold my head
7003,UNDER THE ROSE,And pitch my expectations
7004,UNDER THE ROSE,"Just higher than their level,"
7005,UNDER THE ROSE,They must fall back on patience:
7006,UNDER THE ROSE,"I may not mean to wed,                                            450"
7007,UNDER THE ROSE,Yet I'll be civil.
7008,UNDER THE ROSE,
7009,UNDER THE ROSE,Now sometimes in a dream
7010,UNDER THE ROSE,My heart goes out of me
7011,UNDER THE ROSE,"To build and scheme,"
7012,UNDER THE ROSE,Till I sob after things that seem
7013,UNDER THE ROSE,So pleasant in a dream:
7014,UNDER THE ROSE,A home such as I see
7015,UNDER THE ROSE,My blessed neighbours live in
7016,UNDER THE ROSE,"With father and with mother,"
7017,UNDER THE ROSE,"All proud of one another,                                         460"
7018,UNDER THE ROSE,Named by one common name
7019,UNDER THE ROSE,From baby in the bud
7020,UNDER THE ROSE,To full-blown workman father;
7021,UNDER THE ROSE,It's little short of Heaven.
7022,UNDER THE ROSE,I'd give my gentle blood
7023,UNDER THE ROSE,To wash my special shame
7024,UNDER THE ROSE,And drown my private grudge;
7025,UNDER THE ROSE,I'd toil and moil much rather
7026,UNDER THE ROSE,The dingiest cottage drudge
7027,UNDER THE ROSE,"Whose mother need not blush,                                      470"
7028,UNDER THE ROSE,Than live here like a lady
7029,UNDER THE ROSE,And see my Mother flush
7030,UNDER THE ROSE,And hear her voice unsteady
7031,UNDER THE ROSE,"Sometimes, yet never dare"
7032,UNDER THE ROSE,Ask to share her care.
7033,UNDER THE ROSE,
7034,UNDER THE ROSE,Of course the servants sneer
7035,UNDER THE ROSE,Behind my back at me;
7036,UNDER THE ROSE,"Of course the village girls,"
7037,UNDER THE ROSE,Who envy me my curls
7038,UNDER THE ROSE,"And gowns and idleness,                                           480"
7039,UNDER THE ROSE,Take comfort in a jeer;
7040,UNDER THE ROSE,Of course the ladies guess
7041,UNDER THE ROSE,Just so much of my history
7042,UNDER THE ROSE,As points the emphatic stress
7043,UNDER THE ROSE,With which they laud my Lady;
7044,UNDER THE ROSE,The gentlemen who catch
7045,UNDER THE ROSE,A casual glimpse of me
7046,UNDER THE ROSE,"And turn again to see,"
7047,UNDER THE ROSE,Their valets on the watch
7048,UNDER THE ROSE,"To speak a word with me,                                          490"
7049,UNDER THE ROSE,All know and sting me wild;
7050,UNDER THE ROSE,Till I am almost ready
7051,UNDER THE ROSE,"To wish that I were dead,"
7052,UNDER THE ROSE,"No faces more to see,"
7053,UNDER THE ROSE,"No more words to be said,"
7054,UNDER THE ROSE,My Mother safe at last
7055,UNDER THE ROSE,"Disburdened of her child,"
7056,UNDER THE ROSE,And the past past.
7057,UNDER THE ROSE,
7058,UNDER THE ROSE,'All equal before God'--
7059,UNDER THE ROSE,"Our Rector has it so,                                             500"
7060,UNDER THE ROSE,And sundry sleepers nod:
7061,UNDER THE ROSE,It may be so; I know
7062,UNDER THE ROSE,"All are not equal here,"
7063,UNDER THE ROSE,And when the sleepers wake
7064,UNDER THE ROSE,They make a difference.
7065,UNDER THE ROSE,'All equal in the grave'--
7066,UNDER THE ROSE,That shows an obvious sense:
7067,UNDER THE ROSE,Yet something which I crave
7068,UNDER THE ROSE,Not death itself brings near;
7069,UNDER THE ROSE,Now should death half atone                                       510
7070,UNDER THE ROSE,For all my past; or make
7071,UNDER THE ROSE,The name I bear my own?
7072,UNDER THE ROSE,
7073,UNDER THE ROSE,I love my dear old Nurse
7074,UNDER THE ROSE,Who loved me without gains;
7075,UNDER THE ROSE,"I love my mistress even,"
7076,UNDER THE ROSE,"Friend, Mother, what you will:"
7077,UNDER THE ROSE,But I could almost curse
7078,UNDER THE ROSE,My Father for his pains;
7079,UNDER THE ROSE,And sometimes at my prayer
7080,UNDER THE ROSE,Kneeling in sight of Heaven                                       520
7081,UNDER THE ROSE,I almost curse him still:
7082,UNDER THE ROSE,Why did he set his snare
7083,UNDER THE ROSE,To catch at unaware
7084,UNDER THE ROSE,My Mother's foolish youth;
7085,UNDER THE ROSE,"Load me with shame that's hers,"
7086,UNDER THE ROSE,"And her with something worse,"
7087,UNDER THE ROSE,A lifelong lie for truth?
7088,UNDER THE ROSE,
7089,UNDER THE ROSE,I think my mind is fixed
7090,UNDER THE ROSE,On one point and made up:
7091,UNDER THE ROSE,To accept my lot unmixed;                                         530
7092,UNDER THE ROSE,Never to drug the cup
7093,UNDER THE ROSE,But drink it by myself.
7094,UNDER THE ROSE,I'll not be wooed for pelf;
7095,UNDER THE ROSE,I'll not blot out my shame
7096,UNDER THE ROSE,With any man's good name;
7097,UNDER THE ROSE,"But nameless as I stand,"
7098,UNDER THE ROSE,"My hand is my own hand,"
7099,UNDER THE ROSE,And nameless as I came

7153,DESPISED AND REJECTED,Leave me in peace:
7154,DESPISED AND REJECTED,Fear not that I should crave
7155,DESPISED AND REJECTED,Aught thou mayst have.
7156,DESPISED AND REJECTED,"Leave me in peace, yea trouble me no more,"

7158,DESPISED AND REJECTED,"What, shall I not be let"
7159,DESPISED AND REJECTED,"Alone, that thou dost vex me yet?"
7160,DESPISED AND REJECTED,
7161,DESPISED AND REJECTED,But all night long that voice spake urgently:

7164,DESPISED AND REJECTED,"'Rise, let Me in.'"
7165,DESPISED AND REJECTED,Pleading with tears:

7496,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,"Though the life-cord was so brittle,"
7497,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,The love-cord was very strong.
7498,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,I would wake a little space
7499,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,Till I find a sleeping-place.
7500,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,
7501,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,"You can go,--I shall not weep;"

7520,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,A dim hand knocks at the door.

7536,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,Who hath talked of weeping?--Yet
7537,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,"There is something at my heart,"
7538,DEATH'S CHILL BETWEEN,"Gnawing, I would fain forget,"

7557,HEART'S CHILL BETWEEN,
7558,HEART'S CHILL BETWEEN,Why strive for love when love is o'er?
7559,HEART'S CHILL BETWEEN,Why bind a restive heart?--
7560,HEART'S CHILL BETWEEN,He never knew the pain I bore
7561,HEART'S CHILL BETWEEN,In saying: 'We must part;                                        10

7613,REPINING,
7614,REPINING,
7615,REPINING,She sat alway thro' the long day
7616,REPINING,Spinning the weary thread away;
7617,REPINING,And ever said in undertone:
7618,REPINING,"'Come, that I be no more alone.'"
7619,REPINING,
7620,REPINING,From early dawn to set of sun
7621,REPINING,"Working, her task was still undone;"
7622,REPINING,And the long thread seemed to increase
7623,REPINING,Even while she spun and did not cease.
7624,REPINING,She heard the gentle turtle-dove
7625,REPINING,Tell to its mate a tale of love;                                   10
7626,REPINING,"She saw the glancing swallows fly,"
7627,REPINING,Ever a social company;
7628,REPINING,She knew each bird upon its nest
7629,REPINING,Had cheering songs to bring it rest;
7630,REPINING,None lived alone save only she;--
7631,REPINING,The wheel went round more wearily;
7632,REPINING,She wept and said in undertone:
7633,REPINING,"'Come, that I be no more alone.'"
7634,REPINING,
7635,REPINING,"Day followed day, and still she sighed"
7636,REPINING,"For love, and was not satisfied;                                   20"
7637,REPINING,"Until one night, when the moonlight"
7638,REPINING,"Turned all the trees to silver white,"
7639,REPINING,"She heard, what ne'er she heard before,"
7640,REPINING,A steady hand undo the door.
7641,REPINING,The nightingale since set of sun
7642,REPINING,"Her throbbing music had not done,"
7643,REPINING,And she had listened silently;
7644,REPINING,"But now the wind had changed, and she"
7645,REPINING,"Heard the sweet song no more, but heard"
7646,REPINING,Beside her bed a whispered word:                                   30
7647,REPINING,"'Damsel, rise up; be not afraid;"
7648,REPINING,"For I am come at last,' it said."
7649,REPINING,
7650,REPINING,"She trembled, tho' the voice was mild;"
7651,REPINING,She trembled like a frightened child;--
7652,REPINING,"Till she looked up, and then she saw"
7653,REPINING,The unknown speaker without awe.
7654,REPINING,"He seemed a fair young man, his eyes"
7655,REPINING,Beaming with serious charities;
7656,REPINING,His cheek was white but hardly pale;
7657,REPINING,And a dim glory like a veil                                        40
7658,REPINING,"Hovered about his head, and shone"
7659,REPINING,Thro' the whole room till night was gone.
7660,REPINING,
7661,REPINING,"So her fear fled; and then she said,"
7662,REPINING,Leaning upon her quiet bed:
7663,REPINING,"'Now thou art come, I prithee stay,"
7664,REPINING,"That I may see thee in the day,"
7665,REPINING,"And learn to know thy voice, and hear"
7666,REPINING,It evermore calling me near.'
7667,REPINING,
7668,REPINING,"He answered: 'Rise, and follow me.'"
7669,REPINING,But she looked upwards wonderingly:                                50
7670,REPINING,"'And whither would'st thou go, friend? stay"
7671,REPINING,Until the dawning of the day.'
7672,REPINING,"But he said: 'The wind ceaseth, Maid;"
7673,REPINING,Of chill nor damp be thou afraid.'
7674,REPINING,
7675,REPINING,"She bound her hair up from the floor,"
7676,REPINING,And passed in silence from the door.
7677,REPINING,
7678,REPINING,"So they went forth together, he"
7679,REPINING,Helping her forward tenderly.
7680,REPINING,The hedges bowed beneath his hand;
7681,REPINING,Forth from the streams came the dry land                           60
7682,REPINING,As they passed over; evermore
7683,REPINING,The pallid moonbeams shone before;
7684,REPINING,"And the wind hushed, and nothing stirred;"
7685,REPINING,"Not even a solitary bird,"
7686,REPINING,"Scared by their footsteps, fluttered by"
7687,REPINING,Where aspen-trees stood steadily.
7688,REPINING,
7689,REPINING,"As they went on, at length a sound"
7690,REPINING,Came trembling on the air around;
7691,REPINING,The undistinguishable hum
7692,REPINING,"Of life, voices that go and come                                   70"
7693,REPINING,"Of busy men, and the child's sweet"
7694,REPINING,"High laugh, and noise of trampling feet."
7695,REPINING,
7696,REPINING,Then he said: 'Wilt thou go and see?'
7697,REPINING,And she made answer joyfully:
7698,REPINING,"'The noise of life, of human life,"
7699,REPINING,"Of dear communion without strife,"
7700,REPINING,Of converse held 'twixt friend and friend;
7701,REPINING,Is it not here our path shall end?'
7702,REPINING,He led her on a little way
7703,REPINING,Until they reached a hillock: 'Stay.'                              80
7704,REPINING,
7705,REPINING,It was a village in a plain.
7706,REPINING,High mountains screened it from the rain
7707,REPINING,And stormy wind; and nigh at hand
7708,REPINING,"A bubbling streamlet flowed, o'er sand"
7709,REPINING,"Pebbly and fine, and sent life up"
7710,REPINING,Green succous stalk and flower-cup.
7711,REPINING,
7712,REPINING,"Gradually, day's harbinger,"
7713,REPINING,A chilly wind began to stir.
7714,REPINING,It seemed a gentle powerless breeze
7715,REPINING,That scarcely rustled thro' the trees;                             90
7716,REPINING,And yet it touched the mountain's head
7717,REPINING,And the paths man might never tread.
7718,REPINING,But hearken: in the quiet weather
7719,REPINING,Do all the streams flow down together?--
7720,REPINING,
7721,REPINING,"No, 'tis a sound more terrible"
7722,REPINING,Than tho' a thousand rivers fell.
7723,REPINING,The everlasting ice and snow
7724,REPINING,"Were loosened then, but not to flow;--"
7725,REPINING,With a loud crash like solid thunder
7726,REPINING,"The avalanche came, burying under                                 100"
7727,REPINING,The village; turning life and breath
7728,REPINING,And rest and joy and plans to death.
7729,REPINING,
7730,REPINING,"'Oh! let us fly, for pity fly;"
7731,REPINING,"Let us go hence, friend, thou and I."
7732,REPINING,There must be many regions yet
7733,REPINING,Where these things make not desolate.'
7734,REPINING,He looked upon her seriously;
7735,REPINING,Then said: 'Arise and follow me.'
7736,REPINING,The path that lay before them was
7737,REPINING,Nigh covered over with long grass;                                110
7738,REPINING,And many slimy things and slow
7739,REPINING,Trailed on between the roots below.
7740,REPINING,The moon looked dimmer than before;
7741,REPINING,And shadowy cloudlets floating o'er
7742,REPINING,"Its face sometimes quite hid its light,"
7743,REPINING,And filled the skies with deeper night.
7744,REPINING,
7745,REPINING,"At last, as they went on, the noise"
7746,REPINING,Was heard of the sea's mighty voice;
7747,REPINING,And soon the ocean could be seen
7748,REPINING,In its long restlessness serene.                                  120
7749,REPINING,Upon its breast a vessel rode
7750,REPINING,That drowsily appeared to nod
7751,REPINING,"As the great billows rose and fell,"
7752,REPINING,"And swelled to sink, and sank to swell."
7753,REPINING,
7754,REPINING,Meanwhile the strong wind had come forth
7755,REPINING,"From the chill regions of the North,"
7756,REPINING,The mighty wind invisible.
7757,REPINING,And the low waves began to swell;
7758,REPINING,And the sky darkened overhead;
7759,REPINING,"And the moon once looked forth, then fled                         130"
7760,REPINING,Behind dark clouds; while here and there
7761,REPINING,The lightning shone out in the air;
7762,REPINING,And the approaching thunder rolled
7763,REPINING,With angry pealings manifold.
7764,REPINING,"How many vows were made, and prayers"
7765,REPINING,That in safe times were cold and scarce.
7766,REPINING,Still all availed not; and at length
7767,REPINING,"The waves arose in all their strength,"
7768,REPINING,"And fought against the ship, and filled"
7769,REPINING,"The ship. Then were the clouds unsealed,                          140"
7770,REPINING,"And the rain hurried forth, and beat"
7771,REPINING,On every side and over it.
7772,REPINING,
7773,REPINING,"Some clung together, and some kept"
7774,REPINING,"A long stern silence, and some wept."
7775,REPINING,Many half-crazed looked on in wonder
7776,REPINING,As the strong timbers rent asunder;
7777,REPINING,"Friends forgot friends, foes fled to foes;--"
7778,REPINING,And still the water rose and rose.
7779,REPINING,
7780,REPINING,'Ah woe is me! Whom I have seen
7781,REPINING,Are now as tho' they had not been.                                150
7782,REPINING,"In the earth there is room for birth,"
7783,REPINING,And there are graves enough in earth;
7784,REPINING,"Why should the cold sea, tempest-torn,"
7785,REPINING,Bury those whom it hath not borne?'
7786,REPINING,
7787,REPINING,"He answered not, and they went on."
7788,REPINING,The glory of the heavens was gone;
7789,REPINING,The moon gleamed not nor any star;
7790,REPINING,"Cold winds were rustling near and far,"
7791,REPINING,And from the trees the dry leaves fell
7792,REPINING,With a sad sound unspeakable.                                     160
7793,REPINING,The air was cold; till from the South
7794,REPINING,"A gust blew hot, like sudden drouth,"
7795,REPINING,Into their faces; and a light
7796,REPINING,"Glowing and red, shone thro' the night."
7797,REPINING,
7798,REPINING,A mighty city full of flame
7799,REPINING,And death and sounds without a name.
7800,REPINING,"Amid the black and blinding smoke,"
7801,REPINING,"The people, as one man, awoke."
7802,REPINING,Oh! happy they who yesterday
7803,REPINING,On the long journey went away;                                    170
7804,REPINING,"Whose pallid lips, smiling and chill,"
7805,REPINING,While the flames scorch them smile on still;

7811,REPINING,Those in the town could see and hear
7812,REPINING,A shaded river flowing near;
7813,REPINING,The broad deep bed could hardly hold

7819,REPINING,Women were mighty as strong men.
7820,REPINING,"Some knelt in prayer, believing still,"
7821,REPINING,"Resigned unto a righteous will,"
7822,REPINING,"Bowing beneath the chastening rod,"
7823,REPINING,"Lost to the world, but found of God."
7824,REPINING,"Some prayed for friend, for child, for wife;"
7825,REPINING,Some prayed for faith; some prayed for life;                      190
7826,REPINING,"While some, proud even in death, hope gone,"
7827,REPINING,"Steadfast and still, stood looking on."

7829,REPINING,'Death--death--oh! let us fly from death;
7830,REPINING,Where'er we go it followeth;
7831,REPINING,All these are dead; and we alone

7833,REPINING,What is this thing? thus hurriedly
7834,REPINING,To pass into eternity;
7835,REPINING,To leave the earth so full of mirth;
7836,REPINING,To lose the profit of our birth;                                  200
7837,REPINING,"To die and be no more; to cease,"

7843,REPINING,
7844,REPINING,He sighed and they went on together;
7845,REPINING,Beneath their feet did the grass wither;
7846,REPINING,Across the heaven high overhead
7847,REPINING,Dark misty clouds floated and fled;                               210
7848,REPINING,"And in their bosom was the thunder,"
7849,REPINING,"And angry lightnings flashed out under,"
7850,REPINING,Forked and red and menacing;
7851,REPINING,Far off the wind was muttering;
7852,REPINING,"It seemed to tell, not understood,"
7853,REPINING,Strange secrets to the listening wood.
7854,REPINING,
7855,REPINING,Upon its wings it bore the scent
7856,REPINING,Of blood of a great armament:
7857,REPINING,Then saw they how on either side
7858,REPINING,Fields were down-trodden far and wide.                            220
7859,REPINING,That morning at the break of day
7860,REPINING,Two nations had gone forth to slay.
7861,REPINING,
7862,REPINING,As a man soweth so he reaps.
7863,REPINING,The field was full of bleeding heaps;
7864,REPINING,Ghastly corpses of men and horses
7865,REPINING,That met death at a thousand sources;
7866,REPINING,Cold limbs and putrifying flesh;
7867,REPINING,Long love-locks clotted to a mesh
7868,REPINING,That stifled; stiffened mouths beneath
7869,REPINING,Staring eyes that had looked on death.                            230
7870,REPINING,
7871,REPINING,But these were dead: these felt no more
7872,REPINING,The anguish of the wounds they bore.
7873,REPINING,"Behold, they shall not sigh again,"
7874,REPINING,"Nor justly fear, nor hope in vain."
7875,REPINING,What if none wept above them?--is
7876,REPINING,The sleeper less at rest for this?
7877,REPINING,Is not the young child's slumber sweet
7878,REPINING,When no man watcheth over it?
7879,REPINING,These had deep calm; but all around
7880,REPINING,"There was a deadly smothered sound,                               240"
7881,REPINING,The choking cry of agony
7882,REPINING,From wounded men who could not die;
7883,REPINING,Who watched the black wing of the raven
7884,REPINING,"Rise like a cloud 'twixt them and heaven,"
7885,REPINING,And in the distance flying fast
7886,REPINING,Beheld the eagle come at last.
7887,REPINING,
7888,REPINING,She knelt down in her agony:
7889,REPINING,"'O Lord, it is enough,' said she:"
7890,REPINING,'My heart's prayer putteth me to shame;

8292,LAST NIGHT,"I went down early, I stayed down late."
8293,LAST NIGHT,"Were you snug at home, I should like to know,"

8320,LAST NIGHT,
8321,LAST NIGHT,Good luck to Kate and good luck to you:
8322,LAST NIGHT,I guess she'll be kind when you come to woo.
