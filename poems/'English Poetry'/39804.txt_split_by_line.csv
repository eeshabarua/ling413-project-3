94,_PREFACE_,"In the continuation of the Arabian Tales, the Domdaniel is mentioned; a"
95,_PREFACE_,Seminary for evil Magicians under the Roots of the Sea. From this seed
96,_PREFACE_,the present Romance has grown. Let me not be supposed to prefer the
97,_PREFACE_,"metre in which it is written, abstractedly considered, to the regular"
98,_PREFACE_,"blank verse; the noblest measure, in my judgement, of which our"
99,_PREFACE_,admirable language is capable. For the following Poem I have preferred
100,_PREFACE_,"it, because it suits the varied subject; it is the _Arabesque_ ornament"
101,_PREFACE_,of an Arabian tale.
102,_PREFACE_,
103,_PREFACE_,"The dramatic sketches of Dr. Sayer, a volume which no lover of poetry"
104,_PREFACE_,"will recollect without pleasure, induced me when a young versifier, to"
105,_PREFACE_,practise in this metre. I felt that while it gave the poet a wider range
106,_PREFACE_,"of expression, it satisfied the ear of the reader. It were easy to make"
107,_PREFACE_,a parade of learning by enumerating the various feet which it admits; it
108,_PREFACE_,is only needful to observe that no two lines are employed in
109,_PREFACE_,_sequence_ which can be read into one. Two six-syllable lines (it will
110,_PREFACE_,perhaps be answered) compose an Alexandrine: the truth is that the
111,_PREFACE_,"Alexandrine, when harmonious, is composed of two six-syllable lines."
112,_PREFACE_,
113,_PREFACE_,One advantage this metre assuredly possesses; the dullest reader cannot
114,_PREFACE_,"distort it into discord: he may read it with a _prose mouth_, but its"
115,_PREFACE_,flow and fall will still be perceptible. Verse is not enough favoured by
116,_PREFACE_,"the English reader: perhaps this is owing to the obtrusiveness, the"
117,_PREFACE_,"regular Jews-harp _twing-twang_, of what has been foolishly called"
118,_PREFACE_,"heroic measure. I do not wish the _improvisatorè_ tune, but something"
119,_PREFACE_,"that denotes the sense of harmony, something like the accent of feeling;"
120,_PREFACE_,like the tone which every Poet necessarily gives to Poetry.

133,_THE FIRST BOOK._,_THE FIRST BOOK._
134,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
135,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
136,_THE FIRST BOOK._,How beautiful is night!
137,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"A dewy freshness fills the silent air,"
138,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"No mist obscures, no little cloud"
139,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Breaks the whole serene of heaven:
140,_THE FIRST BOOK._,In full-orbed glory the majestic moon
141,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Rolls thro the dark blue depths.
142,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Beneath her steady ray
143,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"The desert circle spreads,"
144,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky."
145,_THE FIRST BOOK._,How beautiful is night!
146,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
147,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Who at this untimely hour
148,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Wanders o'er the desert sands?
149,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"No station is in view,"
150,_THE FIRST BOOK._,No palm-grove islanded amid the waste.
151,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"The mother and her child,"
152,_THE FIRST BOOK._,The widow and the orphan at this hour
153,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Wander o'er the desert sands.
154,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
155,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Alas! the setting sun
156,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Saw Zeinab in her bliss,"
157,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Hodeirah's wife beloved.
158,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Alas! the wife beloved,"
159,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"The fruitful mother late,"
160,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Whom when the daughters of Arabia named
161,_THE FIRST BOOK._,They wished their lot like her's;
162,_THE FIRST BOOK._,She wanders o'er the desert sands
163,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"A wretched widow now,"
164,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"The fruitful mother of so fair a race,"
165,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"With only one preserved,"
166,_THE FIRST BOOK._,She wanders o'er the wilderness.
167,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
168,_THE FIRST BOOK._,No tear relieved the burthen of her heart;
169,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Stunned with the heavy woe she felt like one
170,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Half-wakened from a midnight dream of blood.
171,_THE FIRST BOOK._,But sometimes when her boy
172,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Would wet her hand with tears,"
173,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"And looking up to her fixed countenance,"
174,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Amid his bursting sobs
175,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Say the dear name of MOTHER, then would she"
176,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Utter a feeble groan.
177,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"At length collecting, Zeinab turned her eyes"
178,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"To heaven, exclaiming, ""praised be the Lord!"
179,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""He gave,[1] he takes away,"
180,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The Lord our God is good!"""
181,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
182,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Good is he?"" cried the boy,"
183,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Why are my brethren and my sisters slain?"
184,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Why is my father killed?"
185,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Did ever we neglect our prayers,"
186,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Or ever lift a hand unclean to heaven?"
187,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Did ever stranger from our tent"
188,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Unwelcomed turn away?"
189,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Mother, he is not good!"""
190,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
191,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Then Zeinab beat her breast in agony,"
192,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""O God forgive my child!"
193,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""He knows not what he says!"
194,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Thou know'st I did not teach him thoughts like these,"
195,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""O Prophet, pardon him!"""
196,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
197,_THE FIRST BOOK._,She had not wept till that assuaging prayer....
198,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"The fountains of her eyes were opened then,"
199,_THE FIRST BOOK._,And tears relieved her heart.
200,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"She raised her swimming eyes to Heaven,"
201,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Allah, thy will be done!"
202,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Beneath the dispensation of thy wrath"
203,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""I groan, but murmur not."
204,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The Day of the Trial will come,"
205,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""When I shall understand how profitable"
206,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""It is to suffer now."""
207,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
208,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Young Thalaba in silence heard reproof,"
209,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"His brow in manly frowns was knit,"
210,_THE FIRST BOOK._,With manly thoughts his heart was full.
211,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Tell me who slew my father?"" cried the boy."
212,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Zeinab replied and said,"
213,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""I knew not that there lived thy father's foe."
214,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The blessings of the poor for him"
215,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Went daily up to Heaven,"
216,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""In distant lands the traveller told his praise."
217,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""I did not think there lived"
218,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Hodeirah's enemy."""
219,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
220,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""But I will hunt him thro' the earth!"""
221,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Young Thalaba exclaimed.
222,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Already I can bend my father's bow,"
223,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Soon will my arm have strength"
224,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""To drive the arrow-feathers to his heart."""
225,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
226,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Zeinab replied, ""O Thalaba, my child,"
227,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Thou lookest on to distant days,"
228,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""And we are in the desert far from men!"""
229,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
230,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Not till that moment her afflicted heart
231,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Had leisure for the thought.
232,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"She cast her eyes around,"
233,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Alas! no tents were there
234,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Beside the bending sands;
235,_THE FIRST BOOK._,No palm tree rose to spot the wilderness.
236,_THE FIRST BOOK._,The dark blue sky closed round
237,_THE FIRST BOOK._,And rested[2] like a dome
238,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Upon the circling waste.
239,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"She cast her eyes around,"
240,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Famine and Thirst were there.
241,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Then the mother bowed her head,"
242,_THE FIRST BOOK._,And wept upon her child.
243,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
244,_THE FIRST BOOK._,... Sudden a cry of wonder
245,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"From Thalaba aroused her,"
246,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"She raised her head, and saw"
247,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Where high in air a stately palace rose.
248,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Amid a grove embowered
249,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Stood the prodigious pile,"
250,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Trees of such ancient majesty
251,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Towered not on Yemen's happy hills,"
252,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Nor crowned the stately brow of Lebanon.
253,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Fabric so vast, so lavishly enriched,"
254,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"For Idol, or for Tyrant, never yet"
255,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Raised the slave race of men
256,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"In Rome, nor in the elder Babylon,"
257,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Nor old Persepolis,"
258,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Nor where the family of Greece
259,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Hymned Eleutherian Jove.
260,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Here studding azure[3] tablatures
261,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"And rayed with feeble light,"
262,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Star-like the ruby and the diamond shone:
263,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Here on the golden towers
264,_THE FIRST BOOK._,The yellow moon-beam lay;
265,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Here with white splendour floods the silver wall.
266,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Less wonderous pile and less magnificent
267,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Sennamar[4] built at Hirah, tho' his art"
268,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Sealed with one stone the ample edifice
269,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"And made its colours, like the serpents skin"
270,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Play with a changeful beauty: him, its Lord"
271,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Jealous lest after-effort might surpass
272,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"The now unequalled palace, from its height"
273,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Dashed on the pavement down.
274,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
275,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"They entered, and through aromatic paths"
276,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Wondering they went along.
277,_THE FIRST BOOK._,At length upon a mossy bank
278,_THE FIRST BOOK._,Beneath a tall mimosa's shade
279,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"That o'er him bent its living canopy,"
280,_THE FIRST BOOK._,They saw a man reclined.
281,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Young he appeared, for on his cheek there shone"
282,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"The morning glow of health,"
283,_THE FIRST BOOK._,And the brown beard curled close around his chin.
284,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"He slept, but at the sound"
285,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Of coming feet awakening, fixed his eyes"
286,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"In wonder, on the wanderer and her child."
287,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Forgive us,"" Zeinab cried,"
288,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Distress hath made us bold."
289,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Relieve the widow and the fatherless."
290,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Blessed are they who succour the distrest"
291,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""For them hath God appointed Paradise."""
292,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
293,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"He heard, and he looked up to heaven,"
294,_THE FIRST BOOK._,And tears ran down his cheeks:
295,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""It is a human voice!"
296,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""I thank thee, O my God!"
297,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""How many an age has past"
298,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Since the sweet sounds have visited mine ear!"
299,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""I thank thee, O my God,"
300,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""It is a human voice!"""
301,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
302,_THE FIRST BOOK._,To Zeinab turning then he cried
303,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""O mortal who art thou"
304,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Whose gifted eyes have pierced"
305,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The shadow of concealment that hath wrapt"
306,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""These bowers, so many an age,"
307,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""From eye of mortal man?"
308,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""For countless years have past"
309,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""And never foot of man"
310,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The bowers of Irem trod."
311,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Save only I, a miserable wretch"
312,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""From Heaven and Earth shut out!"""
313,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
314,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Fearless, and scarce surprized,"
315,_THE FIRST BOOK._,For grief in Zeinab's soul
316,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"All other feebler feelings overpowered,"
317,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"She answered, ""Yesterday"
318,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""I was a wife beloved,"
319,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The fruitful mother of a numerous race."
320,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""I am a widow now,"
321,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Of all my offspring this alone is left."
322,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Praise to the Lord our God,"
323,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""He gave, he takes away!"""
324,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
325,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"Then said the stranger, ""Not by Heaven unseen"
326,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Nor with unguided feet"
327,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Thy steps have reached this secret place"
328,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Nor for light purpose is the Veil,"
329,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""That from the Universe hath long shut out"
330,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""These ancient bowers, withdrawn."
331,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Hear thou my words, O mortal, in thy heart"
332,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Treasure the wonders I shall tell;"
333,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""And when amid the world"
334,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Thou shall emerge again"
335,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Repeat the warning tale."
336,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Why have the Fathers suffered, but to make"
337,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The Children wisely safe?"""
338,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
339,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The Paradise of Irem[5] this,"
340,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""And that the palace pile"
341,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Which Shedad built, the King."
342,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Alas! in the days of my youth"
343,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The hum of the populous world"
344,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Was heard in yon wilderness waste!"
345,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""O'er all the winding sands[6]"
346,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The tents of Ad were pitch'd;"
347,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Happy Al-Ahkaf then,"
348,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""For many and brave were her sons,"
349,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Her daughters were many and fair."
350,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
351,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""My name was Aswad then."
352,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Alas! alas! how strange"
353,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The sound so long unheard!"
354,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Of noble race I came,"
355,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""One of the wealthy of the earth my Sire,"
356,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""An hundred horses in my father's stalls"
357,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Stood ready for his will;"
358,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Numerous his robes of silk,"
359,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""The number of his camels was not known."
360,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""These were my heritance,"
361,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""O God! thy gifts were these;"
362,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""But better had it been for Aswad's soul"
363,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""To have asked alms on earth,"
364,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""And begged the crumbs that from his table fell,"
365,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""So he had known thy word."
366,_THE FIRST BOOK._,
367,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Boy who hast reached this solitude,"
368,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""Fear the Lord in the days of thy youth!"
369,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""My knee was never taught"
370,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""To bend before my God,"
371,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""My voice was never taught"
372,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""To shape one holy prayer."
373,_THE FIRST BOOK._,"""We worshipped Idols, wood and stone,"

1035,DEMON.,"Not on Ocean, not on Earth."
1036,DEMON.,Only eyes that view
1037,DEMON.,"Allah's glory throne,"
1038,DEMON.,See his hiding-place.
1039,DEMON.,"From some believing Spirit, ask and learn."
1040,DEMON.,
1041,DEMON.,"""Bring the dead Hodeirah here,"""
1042,DEMON.,"Khawla cried, ""and he shall tell."""
1043,DEMON.,"The Demon heard her bidding, and was gone."
1044,DEMON.,"A moment passed, and at her feet"
1045,DEMON.,Hodeirah's corpse was laid.
1046,DEMON.,"His hand still held the sword he grasped in death,"
1047,DEMON.,The blood not yet had clotted on his wound.
1048,DEMON.,
1049,DEMON.,The Sorceress looked and with a smile
1050,DEMON.,That kindled to more fiendishness
1051,DEMON.,"Her hideous features, cried,"
1052,DEMON.,"""Where Hodeirah is thy soul?"
1053,DEMON.,"""Is it in the [24]Zemzem well?"
1054,DEMON.,"""Is it in the Eden groves?"
1055,DEMON.,"""Waits it for the judgement-blast"
1056,DEMON.,"""In the trump of Israfil?"
1057,DEMON.,"""Is it plumed with silver wings"
1058,DEMON.,"""Underneath the throne of God?"
1059,DEMON.,"""Even if beneath his throne"
1060,DEMON.,"""Hodeirah, thou shalt hear,"
1061,DEMON.,"""Thou shalt obey my voice!"""
1062,DEMON.,
1063,DEMON.,"She said, and muttered charms that Hell in fear"
1064,DEMON.,And Heaven in horror heard.
1065,DEMON.,"Soon the stiff eye-balls rolled,"
1066,DEMON.,"The muscles with convulsive motion shook,"
1067,DEMON.,"The white lips quivered. Khawla saw, her soul"
1068,DEMON.,"Exulted, and she cried,"
1069,DEMON.,"""Prophet! behold my power!"
1070,DEMON.,"""Not even death secures"
1071,DEMON.,"""Thy slaves from Khawla's Spell!"
1072,DEMON.,"""Where Hodeirah is thy child?"""
1073,DEMON.,
1074,DEMON.,"Hodeirah groaned and closed his eyes,"
1075,DEMON.,As if in the night and the blindness of death
1076,DEMON.,He would have hid himself.
1077,DEMON.,
1078,DEMON.,"""Speak to my question!"" she exclaimed,"
1079,DEMON.,"""Or in that mangled body thou shall live"
1080,DEMON.,"""Ages of torture! answer me!"
1081,DEMON.,"""Where can we find the Boy?"""
1082,DEMON.,
1083,DEMON.,"""God! God! Hodeirah cried,"
1084,DEMON.,"""Release me from this life,"
1085,DEMON.,"""From this intolerable agony!"""
1086,DEMON.,
1087,DEMON.,"""Speak!"" cried the Sorceress; and she snatched"
1088,DEMON.,"A Viper from the floor,"
1089,DEMON.,And with the living reptile lashed[25] his neck.
1090,DEMON.,"Wreathed, round him with the blow,"
1091,DEMON.,The Reptile tighter drew her folds
1092,DEMON.,"And raised her wrathful head,"
1093,DEMON.,And fixed into his face
1094,DEMON.,"Her deadly teeth, and shed"
1095,DEMON.,Poison in every wound.
1096,DEMON.,"In vain! for Allah heard Hodeirah's prayer,"
1097,DEMON.,And Khawla on a corpse
1098,DEMON.,Had wrecked her baffled rage.
1099,DEMON.,The fated fire moved on
1100,DEMON.,And round the Body wrapt its funeral flames.
1101,DEMON.,The flesh and bones in that portentous pile
1102,DEMON.,"Consumed; the Sword alone,"
1103,DEMON.,Circled with fire was left.
1104,DEMON.,
1105,DEMON.,Where is the Boy for whose hand it is destined?
1106,DEMON.,Where the Destroyer who one day shall wield
1107,DEMON.,The Sword that is circled with fire?
1108,DEMON.,"Race accursed, try your charms!"
1109,DEMON.,"Masters of the mighty Spell,"
1110,DEMON.,Mutter o'er your words of power!
1111,DEMON.,"Ye can shatter the dwellings of man,"
1112,DEMON.,"Ye can open the womb of the rock,"
1113,DEMON.,"Ye can shake the foundations of earth,"
1114,DEMON.,But not the Word of God:
1115,DEMON.,But not one letter can ye change
1116,DEMON.,Of what his Will hath written!
1117,DEMON.,
1118,DEMON.,Who shall seek thro' Araby
1119,DEMON.,Hodeirah's dreaded son?
1120,DEMON.,They mingle the Arrows[26] of Chance
1121,DEMON.,The lot of Abdaldar is drawn.
1122,DEMON.,Thirteen moons must wax and wane
1123,DEMON.,Ere the Sorcerer quit his quest.
1124,DEMON.,He must visit every tribe
1125,DEMON.,"That roam the desert wilderness,"
1126,DEMON.,Or dwell beside perennial streams;
1127,DEMON.,Nor leave a solitary tent unsearched
1128,DEMON.,"Till he has found the Boy,"
1129,DEMON.,The hated Boy whose blood alone
1130,DEMON.,Can quench that dreaded fire.
1131,DEMON.,
1132,DEMON.,"A crystal ring Abdaldar bore,"
1133,DEMON.,The powerful gem[27] condensed
1134,DEMON.,Primeval dews that upon Caucasus
1135,DEMON.,Felt the first winter's frost.
1136,DEMON.,Ripening there it lay beneath
1137,DEMON.,"Rock above rock, and mountain ice up-piled"
1138,DEMON.,"On mountain, till the incumbent mass assumed,"
1139,DEMON.,"So huge its bulk, the Ocean's azure hue."
1140,DEMON.,
1141,DEMON.,With this he sought the inner den
1142,DEMON.,Where burnt the eternal flame.
1143,DEMON.,Like waters gushing from some channelled rock
1144,DEMON.,"Full thro' a narrow opening, from a chasm"
1145,DEMON.,The eternal flame streamed up.
1146,DEMON.,No eye beheld the fount
1147,DEMON.,"Of that up-flowing flame,"
1148,DEMON.,"That blazed self-nurtured, and for ever, there."
1149,DEMON.,It was no mortal element: the Abyss
1150,DEMON.,"Supplied it, from the fountains at the first"
1151,DEMON.,Prepared. In the heart of earth it lives and glows
1152,DEMON.,"Her vital heat, till at the day decreed,"
1153,DEMON.,"The voice of God shall let its billows loose,"
1154,DEMON.,To deluge o'er with no abating flood
1155,DEMON.,The consummated World;
1156,DEMON.,"That thenceforth thro' the air must roll,"
1157,DEMON.,The penal Orb of Fire.
1158,DEMON.,
1159,DEMON.,"Unturbaned and unsandalled there,"
1160,DEMON.,"Abdaldar stood before the flame,"
1161,DEMON.,"And held the Ring beside, and spake"
1162,DEMON.,The language that the Elements obey.
1163,DEMON.,"The obedient flame detatched a portion forth,"
1164,DEMON.,"That, in the crystal entering, was condensed,"
1165,DEMON.,"Gem of the gem, its living Eye of fire."
1166,DEMON.,When the hand that wears the spell
1167,DEMON.,"Shall touch the destined Boy,"
1168,DEMON.,"Then shall that Eye be quenched,"
1169,DEMON.,And the freed Element
1170,DEMON.,Fly to its sacred and remembered Spring.
1171,DEMON.,
1172,DEMON.,Now go thy way Abdaldar!
1173,DEMON.,"Servant of Eblis,"
1174,DEMON.,Over Arabia
1175,DEMON.,Seek the Destroyer!
1176,DEMON.,"Over the sands of the scorching Tchama,"
1177,DEMON.,"Over the waterless mountains of Naïd,"
1178,DEMON.,"In Arud pursue him; and Yemen the happy,"
1179,DEMON.,"And Hejaz, the country beloved by believers."
1180,DEMON.,Over Arabia
1181,DEMON.,"Servant of Eblis,"
1182,DEMON.,Seek the Destroyer.
1183,DEMON.,
1184,DEMON.,"From tribe to tribe, from town to town,"
1185,DEMON.,"From tent to tent, Abdaldar past."
1186,DEMON.,Him every morn the all-beholding Eye
1187,DEMON.,"Saw from his couch, unhallowed by a prayer,"
1188,DEMON.,"Rise to the scent of blood,"
1189,DEMON.,And every night lie down.
1190,DEMON.,"That rankling hope within him, that by day"
1191,DEMON.,"Goaded his steps, still stinging him in sleep,"
1192,DEMON.,And startling him with vain accomplishment
1193,DEMON.,From visions still the same.
1194,DEMON.,Many a time his wary hand
1195,DEMON.,"To many a youth applied the Ring,"
1196,DEMON.,And still the dagger in his mantle hid
1197,DEMON.,Was ready for the deed.
1198,DEMON.,
1199,DEMON.,At length to the cords of a tent
1200,DEMON.,That were stretched by an Island of Palms
1201,DEMON.,"In the desolate sea of the sands,"
1202,DEMON.,The weary traveller came.
1203,DEMON.,"Under a shapely palm,"
1204,DEMON.,"Herself as shapely, there a Damsel stood."
1205,DEMON.,She held her ready robe
1206,DEMON.,"And looked towards a Boy,"
1207,DEMON.,Who from the tree above
1208,DEMON.,"With one hand clinging to its trunk,"
1209,DEMON.,Cast with the other down the clustered dates.
1210,DEMON.,
1211,DEMON.,"The Wizard approached the Tree,"
1212,DEMON.,"He leaned on his staff, like a way-faring man,"
1213,DEMON.,And the sweat of his travel was seen on his brow.
1214,DEMON.,"He asks for food, and lo!"
1215,DEMON.,The Damsel proffers him her lap of dates.
1216,DEMON.,"And the Stripling descends, and runs into the tent"
1217,DEMON.,"And brings him forth water, the draught of delight."
1218,DEMON.,
1219,DEMON.,"Anon the Master of the tent,"
1220,DEMON.,The Father of the family
1221,DEMON.,"Came forth, a man in years, of aspect mild."
1222,DEMON.,To the stranger approaching he gave
1223,DEMON.,"The friendly saluting of peace,"
1224,DEMON.,And bade the skin be spread.
1225,DEMON.,"Before the tent they spread the[28] skin,"
1226,DEMON.,"Under a Tamarind's shade,"
1227,DEMON.,"That bending forward, stretched"
1228,DEMON.,Its boughs of beauty far.
1229,DEMON.,"They brought the Traveller rice,"
1230,DEMON.,"With no false colours[29] tinged to tempt the eye,"
1231,DEMON.,"But white as the new-fallen snow,"
1232,DEMON.,When never yet the sullying Sun
1233,DEMON.,"Hath seen its purity,"
1234,DEMON.,Nor the warm Zephyr touched and tainted it.
1235,DEMON.,The dates of the grove before their guest
1236,DEMON.,"They laid, and the luscious fig,"
1237,DEMON.,And water from the well.
1238,DEMON.,The Damsel from the Tamarind tree
1239,DEMON.,Had plucked its acid fruit
1240,DEMON.,And steeped it in water long;
1241,DEMON.,And whoso drank of the cooling[30] draught
1242,DEMON.,He would not wish for wine.
1243,DEMON.,"This to the guest the Damsel brought,"
1244,DEMON.,"And a modest pleasure kindled her cheek,"
1245,DEMON.,When raising from the cup his moistened lips
1246,DEMON.,"The Stranger smiled, and praised, and drank again."
1247,DEMON.,
1248,DEMON.,Whither is gone the Boy?
1249,DEMON.,He had pierced the Melon's pulp
1250,DEMON.,"And closed with wax the wound,"
1251,DEMON.,And he had duly gone at morn
1252,DEMON.,"And watched its ripening rind,"
1253,DEMON.,And now all joyfully he brings
1254,DEMON.,The treasure now matured.
1255,DEMON.,His dark eyes sparkle with a boy's delight.
1256,DEMON.,As he pours out its liquid[31] lusciousness
1257,DEMON.,And proffers to the guest.
1258,DEMON.,
1259,DEMON.,"Abdaldar ate, and he was satisfied:"
1260,DEMON.,And now his tongue discoursed
1261,DEMON.,"Of regions far remote,"
1262,DEMON.,As one whose busy feet had travelled long.
1263,DEMON.,"The Father of the family,"
1264,DEMON.,"With a calm eye and quiet smile,"
1265,DEMON.,Sate pleased to hearken him.
1266,DEMON.,"The Damsel who removed the meal,"
1267,DEMON.,She loitered on the way
1268,DEMON.,And listened with full [32]hands
1269,DEMON.,A moment motionless.
1270,DEMON.,All eagerly the Boy
1271,DEMON.,"Watches the Traveller's lips,"
1272,DEMON.,And still the wily man
1273,DEMON.,With seemly kindness to the eager Boy
1274,DEMON.,Directs his winning tale.
1275,DEMON.,"Ah, cursed man! if this be he,"
1276,DEMON.,"If thou hast found the object of thy search,"
1277,DEMON.,"Thy hate, thy bloody aim,"
1278,DEMON.,Into what deep damnation wilt thou plunge
1279,DEMON.,Thy miserable soul!
1280,DEMON.,Look! how his eye delighted watches thine!
1281,DEMON.,Look! how his open lips
1282,DEMON.,Gasp at the winning tale!
1283,DEMON.,And nearer now he comes
1284,DEMON.,To lose no word of that delightful talk.
1285,DEMON.,"Then, as in familiar mood,"
1286,DEMON.,Upon the Stripling's arm
1287,DEMON.,"The Sorcerer laid his hand,"
1288,DEMON.,And the fire of the Crystal fled.
1289,DEMON.,
1290,DEMON.,Whilst the sudden shoot of joy
1291,DEMON.,"Made pale Abdaldar's cheek,"
1292,DEMON.,The Master's voice was heard:
1293,DEMON.,"""It is the hour[33] of prayer,..."
1294,DEMON.,"""My children, let us purify ourselves"
1295,DEMON.,"""And praise the Lord our God!"""
1296,DEMON.,"The Boy the water brought,"
1297,DEMON.,"After the law[34] they purified themselves,"
1298,DEMON.,And bent their faces to the earth in prayer.
1299,DEMON.,
1300,DEMON.,"All, save Abdaldar; over Thalaba"
1301,DEMON.,"He stands, and lifts the dagger to destroy."
1302,DEMON.,Before his lifted arm received
1303,DEMON.,"Its impulse to descend,"
1304,DEMON.,The Blast of the Desert came.
1305,DEMON.,"Prostrate in prayer, the pious family"
1306,DEMON.,Felt not the Simoom[35] pass.
1307,DEMON.,"They rose, and lo! the Sorcerer lying dead,"
1308,DEMON.,Holding the dagger in his blasted hand.

1460,THALABA.,So Thalaba drew on
1461,THALABA.,The written ring of gold.
1462,THALABA.,Then in the hollow grave
1463,THALABA.,"They laid Abdaldar's corpse,"
1464,THALABA.,And levelled over him the desert dust.
1465,THALABA.,
1466,THALABA.,"The Sun arose, ascending from beneath"

1468,THALABA.,"As Thalaba to his ablutions went,"

1473,THALABA.,The desert dust was dark and close around;
1474,THALABA.,"And the night air had been so moveless calm,"

1476,THALABA.,Shaken a ripe date down.
1477,THALABA.,
1478,THALABA.,Amazed to hear the tale
1479,THALABA.,Forth from the tent came Moath and his child.
1480,THALABA.,Awhile the thoughtful man surveyed the corpse
1481,THALABA.,"Silent with downward eyes,"
1482,THALABA.,"Then turning spake to Thalaba and said,"
1483,THALABA.,"""I have heard that there are places by the abode"

1491,THALABA.,"""So foul with magic and all blasphemy,"
1492,THALABA.,"""That Earth[40] like Heaven rejects him? it is best"
1493,THALABA.,"""Forsake the station. Let us strike our tent."
1494,THALABA.,"""The place is tainted ... and behold"
1495,THALABA.,"""The Vulture[41] hovers yonder, and his scream"
1496,THALABA.,"""Chides us that we still we scare him from his banquet."
1497,THALABA.,"""So let the accursed one"
1498,THALABA.,"""Find fitting sepulchre."""
1499,THALABA.,
1500,THALABA.,Then from the pollution of death
1501,THALABA.,"With water they made themselves pure,"
1502,THALABA.,And Thalaba drew up
1503,THALABA.,"The fastening of the cords,"
1504,THALABA.,"And Moath furled the tent,"
1505,THALABA.,And from the grove of palms Oneiza led
1506,THALABA.,"The Camels, ready to receive their load."
1507,THALABA.,
1508,THALABA.,The dews had ceased to steam
1509,THALABA.,"Towards the climbing Sun,"
1510,THALABA.,When from the Isle of Palms they went their way.
1511,THALABA.,"And when the Sun had reached his southern height,"
1512,THALABA.,"As back they turned their eyes,"
1513,THALABA.,The distant Palms arose
1514,THALABA.,Like to the top-sails of some far-off fleet
1515,THALABA.,"Distinctly seen, where else"
1516,THALABA.,The Ocean bounds had blended with the sky.
1517,THALABA.,And when the eve came on
1518,THALABA.,The sight returning reached the grove no more.
1519,THALABA.,"They planted the pole of their tent,"
1520,THALABA.,And they laid them down to repose.
1521,THALABA.,
1522,THALABA.,"At midnight Thalaba started up,"
1523,THALABA.,For he felt that the ring on his finger was moved.
1524,THALABA.,"He called on Allah aloud,"
1525,THALABA.,And he called on the Prophet's name.
1526,THALABA.,"Moath arose in alarm,"
1527,THALABA.,"""What ails thee Thalaba?"" he cried,"
1528,THALABA.,"""Is the Robber of night at hand?"""
1529,THALABA.,"""Dost thou not see,"" the youth exclaimed,"
1530,THALABA.,"""A Spirit in the Tent?"""
1531,THALABA.,"Moath looked round and said,"
1532,THALABA.,"""The moon beam shines in the Tent,"
1533,THALABA.,"""I see thee stand in the light,"
1534,THALABA.,"""And thy shadow is black on the ground."""
1535,THALABA.,
1536,THALABA.,Thalaba answered not.
1537,THALABA.,"""Spirit!"" he cried, ""what brings thee here?"
1538,THALABA.,"""In the name of the Prophet, speak,"
1539,THALABA.,"""In the name of Allah, obey!"""
1540,THALABA.,
1541,THALABA.,"He ceased, and there was silence in the Tent."
1542,THALABA.,"""Dost thou not hear?"" quoth Thalaba."
1543,THALABA.,"The listening man replied,"
1544,THALABA.,"""I hear the wind, that flaps"
1545,THALABA.,"""The curtain of the Tent."
1546,THALABA.,
1547,THALABA.,"""The Ring! the Ring!"" the youth exclaimed."
1548,THALABA.,"""For that the Spirit of Evil comes,"
1549,THALABA.,"""By that I see, by that I hear."
1550,THALABA.,"""In the name of God, I ask thee"
1551,THALABA.,"""Who was he that slew my Father?"""
1552,THALABA.,
1553,DEMON.,DEMON.
1554,DEMON.,
1555,DEMON.,Master of the powerful Ring!
1556,DEMON.,"Okba, the wise Magician, did the deed."
1557,DEMON.,
1558,THALABA.,THALABA.
1559,THALABA.,
1560,THALABA.,Where does the Murderer dwell?
1561,THALABA.,
1562,DEMON.,DEMON.
1563,DEMON.,
1564,DEMON.,In the Domdaniel caverns
1565,DEMON.,Under the Roots of the Ocean.
1566,DEMON.,
1567,THALABA.,THALABA.
1568,THALABA.,
1569,THALABA.,Why were my Father and my brethren slain?
1570,THALABA.,
1571,DEMON.,DEMON.
1572,DEMON.,
1573,DEMON.,We knew from the race of Hodeirah
1574,DEMON.,The destined destroyer would come.
1575,DEMON.,
1576,THALABA.,THALABA.
1577,THALABA.,
1578,THALABA.,Bring me my father's sword.
1579,THALABA.,
1580,DEMON.,DEMON.
1581,DEMON.,
1582,DEMON.,"A fire surrounds the fated-sword,"
1583,DEMON.,No Spirit or Magician's hand
1584,DEMON.,Can pierce that guardian flame.
1585,DEMON.,
1586,THALABA.,THALABA.
1587,THALABA.,
1588,THALABA.,Bring me his bow and his arrows.
1589,THALABA.,
1590,THALABA.,"Distinctly Moath heard his voice, and She"
1591,THALABA.,"Who thro' the Veil of Separation, watched"
1592,THALABA.,"All sounds in listening terror, whose suspense"
1593,THALABA.,Forbade the aid of prayer.
1594,THALABA.,They heard the voice of Thalaba;
1595,THALABA.,"But when the Spirit spake, the motionless air"
1596,THALABA.,"Felt not the subtle sounds,"
1597,THALABA.,Too fine for mortal sense.
1598,THALABA.,
1599,THALABA.,"On a sudden the rattle of arrows was heard,"
1600,THALABA.,"And the quiver was laid at the feet of the youth,"
1601,THALABA.,And in his hand they saw Hodeirah's Bow.
1602,THALABA.,"He eyed the Bow, he twanged the string,"
1603,THALABA.,And his heart bounded to the joyous tone.
1604,THALABA.,"Anon he raised his voice, and cried"
1605,THALABA.,"""Go thy way, and never more,"
1606,THALABA.,"""Evil Spirit, haunt our tent!"
1607,THALABA.,"""By the virtue of the Ring,"
1608,THALABA.,"""By Mohammed's holier might,"
1609,THALABA.,"""By the holiest name of God,"
1610,THALABA.,"""Thee and all the Powers of Hell"
1611,THALABA.,"""I adjure and I command"
1612,THALABA.,"""Never more to trouble us!"""
1613,THALABA.,
1614,THALABA.,Nor ever from that hour
1615,THALABA.,"Did rebel Spirit on the Tent intrude,"
1616,THALABA.,Such virtue had the Spell.
1617,THALABA.,
1618,THALABA.,And peacefully the vernal years
1619,THALABA.,Of Thalaba past on.
1620,THALABA.,Till now without an effort he could bend
1621,THALABA.,Hodeirah's stubborn Bow.
1622,THALABA.,"Black were his eyes and bright,"
1623,THALABA.,The sunny hue of health
1624,THALABA.,"Glowed on his tawny cheek,"
1625,THALABA.,His lip was darkened by maturing life;
1626,THALABA.,"Strong were his shapely limbs, his stature tall;"
1627,THALABA.,He was a comely youth.
1628,THALABA.,
1629,THALABA.,Compassion for the child
1630,THALABA.,"Had first old Moath's kindly heart possessed,"
1631,THALABA.,"An orphan, wailing in the wilderness."
1632,THALABA.,"But when he heard his tale, his wonderous tale,"
1633,THALABA.,"Told by the Boy with such eye-speaking truth,"
1634,THALABA.,"Now with sudden bursts of anger,"
1635,THALABA.,"Now in the agony of tears,"
1636,THALABA.,And now in flashes of prophetic joy.
1637,THALABA.,"What had been pity became reverence,"
1638,THALABA.,And like a sacred trust from Heaven
1639,THALABA.,The old man cherished him.
1640,THALABA.,"Now with a father's love,"
1641,THALABA.,"Child of his choice, he loved the Boy,"
1642,THALABA.,And like a father to the Boy was dear.
1643,THALABA.,"Oneiza called him brother, and the youth,"
1644,THALABA.,"More fondly than a brother, loved the maid,"
1645,THALABA.,The loveliest of Arabian maidens she.
1646,THALABA.,How happily the years
1647,THALABA.,Of Thalaba went by!
1648,THALABA.,
1649,THALABA.,It was the wisdom and the will of Heaven
1650,THALABA.,That in a lonely tent had cast
1651,THALABA.,The lot of Thalaba.
1652,THALABA.,There might his soul develope best
1653,THALABA.,Its strengthening energies;
1654,THALABA.,There might he from the world
1655,THALABA.,"Keep his heart pure and uncontaminate,"
1656,THALABA.,Till at the written hour he should be found
1657,THALABA.,"Fit servant of the Lord, without a spot."
1658,THALABA.,
1659,THALABA.,"Years of his youth, how rapidly ye fled"
1660,THALABA.,In that beloved solitude!
1661,THALABA.,"Is the morn fair, and does the freshening breeze"
1662,THALABA.,Flow with cool current o'er his cheek?
1663,THALABA.,Lo! underneath the broad-leaved sycamore
1664,THALABA.,"With lids half closed he lies,"
1665,THALABA.,Dreaming of days to come.
1666,THALABA.,"His dog[42] beside him, in mute blandishment,"
1667,THALABA.,"Now licks his listless hand,"
1668,THALABA.,Now lifts an anxious and expectant eye
1669,THALABA.,Courting the wonted caress.
1670,THALABA.,
1671,THALABA.,Or comes the Father[43] of the Rains
1672,THALABA.,"From his Caves in the uttermost West,"
1673,THALABA.,Comes he in darkness and storms?
1674,THALABA.,"When the blast is loud,"
1675,THALABA.,When the waters fill
1676,THALABA.,"The Travellers tread in the sands,"
1677,THALABA.,When the pouring shower
1678,THALABA.,"Streams adown the roof,"
1679,THALABA.,"When the door-curtain hangs in heavier folds,"
1680,THALABA.,"When the outstrained tent flags loosely,"
1681,THALABA.,"Comfort is within,"
1682,THALABA.,"The embers chearful glow,"
1683,THALABA.,"The sound of the familiar voice,"
1684,THALABA.,The song that lightens toil.
1685,THALABA.,Under the common shelter on dry sand
1686,THALABA.,The quiet Camels ruminate their food;
1687,THALABA.,"From Moath falls the lengthening cord,"
1688,THALABA.,As patiently the old Man
1689,THALABA.,Intwines the strong palm-fibers;[44] by the hearth
1690,THALABA.,"The Damsel shakes the coffee-grains,"
1691,THALABA.,That with warm fragrance fill the tent;
1692,THALABA.,"And while with dextrous fingers, Thalaba"
1693,THALABA.,"Shapes the green basket,[45] haply at his feet"
1694,THALABA.,"Her favourite kidling gnaws the twig,"
1695,THALABA.,"Forgiven plunderer, for Oneiza's sake!"
1696,THALABA.,
1697,THALABA.,Or when the winter torrent rolls
1698,THALABA.,"Down the deep-channelled rain-course, foamingly,"
1699,THALABA.,"Dark with its mountain spoils,"
1700,THALABA.,With bare feet pressing the wet sand
1701,THALABA.,"There wanders Thalaba,"
1702,THALABA.,"The rushing flow, the flowing roar,"
1703,THALABA.,Filling his yielded faculties;
1704,THALABA.,"A vague, a dizzy, a tumultuous joy."
1705,THALABA.,... Or lingers it a vernal brook[46]
1706,THALABA.,Gleaming o'er yellow sands?
1707,THALABA.,"Beneath the lofty bank reclined,"
1708,THALABA.,"With idle eye he views its little waves,"
1709,THALABA.,Quietly listening to the quiet flow;
1710,THALABA.,While in the breathings of the stirring gale
1711,THALABA.,"The tall canes bend above,"
1712,THALABA.,Floating like streamers on the wind
1713,THALABA.,Their lank uplifted leaves.
1714,THALABA.,
1715,THALABA.,"Nor rich,[47] nor poor, was Moath; God had given"
1716,THALABA.,"Enough, and blest him with a mind content."
1717,THALABA.,No hoarded[48] gold disquieted his dreams;
1718,THALABA.,But ever round his station he beheld
1719,THALABA.,"Camels that knew his voice,"
1720,THALABA.,"And home-birds, grouping at Oneiza's call,"
1721,THALABA.,"And goats that, morn and eve,"
1722,THALABA.,Came with full udders to the Damsel's hand.
1723,THALABA.,Dear child! the Tent beneath whose shade they dwelt
1724,THALABA.,That was her work; and she had twined
1725,THALABA.,His girdle's many-hues;
1726,THALABA.,And he had seen his robe
1727,THALABA.,Grow in Oneiza's loom.[49]
1728,THALABA.,How often with a memory-mingled joy
1729,THALABA.,"That made her Mother live before his sight,"
1730,THALABA.,He watched her nimble finders thread the woof!
1731,THALABA.,"Or at the hand-mill[50] when she knelt and toiled,"
1732,THALABA.,"Tost the thin cake on spreading palm,"
1733,THALABA.,Or fixed it on the glowing oven's side
1734,THALABA.,"With bare[51] wet arm, in safe dexterity."
1735,THALABA.,
1736,THALABA.,'Tis the cool evening hour:
1737,THALABA.,The Tamarind from the dew
1738,THALABA.,"Sheaths[52] its young fruit, yet green."
1739,THALABA.,"Before their Tent the mat is spread,"
1740,THALABA.,The old man's aweful voice
1741,THALABA.,Intones[53] the holy Book.
1742,THALABA.,"What if beneath no lamp-illumined dome,"
1743,THALABA.,"Its marble walls[54] bedecked with flourished truth,"
1744,THALABA.,Azure and gold adornment? sinks the Word
1745,THALABA.,"With deeper influence from the Imam's voice,"
1746,THALABA.,"Where in the day of congregation, crowds"
1747,THALABA.,Perform the duty task?
1748,THALABA.,"Their Father is their Priest,"
1749,THALABA.,"The Stars of Heaven their point[55] of prayer,"
1750,THALABA.,And the blue Firmament
1751,THALABA.,"The glorious Temple, where they feel"
1752,THALABA.,The present Deity.
1753,THALABA.,
1754,THALABA.,Yet thro' the purple glow of eve
1755,THALABA.,Shines dimly the white moon.
1756,THALABA.,"The slackened bow, the quiver, the long lance,"
1757,THALABA.,Rest on the pillar[56] of the Tent.
1758,THALABA.,Knitting light palm-leaves[57] for her brother's brow
1759,THALABA.,The dark-eyed damsel sits;
1760,THALABA.,The Old Man tranquilly
1761,THALABA.,Up his curled pipe inhales
1762,THALABA.,The tranquillizing herb.
1763,THALABA.,"So listen they the reed[58] of Thalaba,"
1764,THALABA.,While his skilled fingers modulate
1765,THALABA.,"The low, sweet, soothing, melancholy tones,"
1766,THALABA.,Or if he strung the pearls[59] of Poetry
1767,THALABA.,Singing with agitated face
1768,THALABA.,"And eloquent arms, and sobs that reach the heart,"
1769,THALABA.,A tale[60] of love and woe;
1770,THALABA.,"Then, if the brightening Moon that lit his face"
1771,THALABA.,"In darkness favoured her's,"
1772,THALABA.,"Oh! even with such a look, as, fables say,"
1773,THALABA.,"The mother Ostrich[61] fixes on her egg,"
1774,THALABA.,Till that intense affection
1775,THALABA.,"Kindle its light of life,"
1776,THALABA.,Even in such deep and breathless tenderness
1777,THALABA.,"Oneiza's soul is centered on the youth,"
1778,THALABA.,"So motionless with such an ardent gaze,"
1779,THALABA.,Save when from her full eyes
1780,THALABA.,Quickly she wipes away the gushing tears
1781,THALABA.,That dim his image there.
1782,THALABA.,
1783,THALABA.,She called him brother: was it sister-love
1784,THALABA.,That made the silver rings
1785,THALABA.,"Round her smooth ankles[62] and her twany arms,"
1786,THALABA.,Shine daily brightened? for a brother's eye
1787,THALABA.,"Were her long fingers[63] tinged,"
1788,THALABA.,"As when she trimmed the lamp,"
1789,THALABA.,And thro' the veins and delicate skin
1790,THALABA.,The light shone rosy? that the darkened lids[64]
1791,THALABA.,Gave yet a softer lustre to her eye?
1792,THALABA.,That with such pride she tricked
1793,THALABA.,"Her glossy tresses, and on holy day"
1794,THALABA.,Wreathed the red flower-crown[65] round their jetty waves?
1795,THALABA.,How happily the years
1796,THALABA.,Of Thalaba went by!
1797,THALABA.,
1798,THALABA.,Yet was the heart of Thalaba
1799,THALABA.,Impatient of repose;
1800,THALABA.,Restless he pondered still
1801,THALABA.,"The task for him decreed,"
1802,THALABA.,The mighty and mysterious work announced.
1803,THALABA.,Day by day with youthful ardour
1804,THALABA.,"He the call of Heaven awaits,"
1805,THALABA.,And oft in visions o'er the Murderer's head
1806,THALABA.,"He lifts the avenging arm,"
1807,THALABA.,And oft in dreams he sees
1808,THALABA.,The Sword that is circled with fire.
1809,THALABA.,
1810,THALABA.,"One morn as was their wont, in sportive mood"
1811,THALABA.,"The youth and damsel bent Hodeirah's bow,"
1812,THALABA.,For with no feeble hand nor erring aim
1813,THALABA.,Oneiza could let loose the obedient shaft.
1814,THALABA.,"With head back-bending, Thalaba"
1815,THALABA.,"Shot up the aimless arrow high in air,"
1816,THALABA.,Whose line in vain the aching sight pursued
1817,THALABA.,Lost in the depth of heaven.
1818,THALABA.,"""When will the hour arrive,"" exclaimed the youth,"
1819,THALABA.,"""That I shall aim these fated shafts"
1820,THALABA.,"""To vengeance long delayed?"
1821,THALABA.,"""Have I not strength, my father, for the deed?"
1822,THALABA.,"""Or can the will of Providence"
1823,THALABA.,"""Be mutable like man?"
1824,THALABA.,"""Shall I never be called to the task?"""
1825,THALABA.,
1826,THALABA.,"""Impatient boy!"" quoth Moath, with a smile:"
1827,THALABA.,"""Impatient Thalaba!"" Oneiza cried,"
1828,THALABA.,"And she too smiled, but in her smile"
1829,THALABA.,A mild reproachful melancholy mixed.
1830,THALABA.,
1831,THALABA.,Then Moath pointed where a cloud
1832,THALABA.,"Of Locusts, from the desolated fields"
1833,THALABA.,"Of Syria, winged their way."
1834,THALABA.,"""Lo! how created things"
1835,THALABA.,"""Obey the written doom!"""
1836,THALABA.,
1837,THALABA.,"Onward they came, a dark continuous cloud"
1838,THALABA.,"Of congregated myriads numberless,"
1839,THALABA.,The rushing of whose wings was as the sound
1840,THALABA.,"Of a broad river, headlong in its course"
1841,THALABA.,"Plunged from a mountain summit, or the roar"
1842,THALABA.,"Of a wild ocean in the autumn storm,"
1843,THALABA.,Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks.
1844,THALABA.,"Onward they came, the winds impelled them on,"
1845,THALABA.,"Their work was done, their path of[66] ruin past,"
1846,THALABA.,Their graves were ready in the wilderness.
1847,THALABA.,"""Behold the mighty army!"" Moath cried,"
1848,THALABA.,"""Blindly they move, impelled"
1849,THALABA.,"""By the blind Element."
1850,THALABA.,"""And yonder Birds our welcome visitants,"
1851,THALABA.,"""Lo! where they soar above the embodied host,"
1852,THALABA.,"""Pursue their way, and hang upon their rear,"
1853,THALABA.,"""And thin their spreading flanks,"
1854,THALABA.,"""Rejoicing o'er their banquet! deemest thou"
1855,THALABA.,"""The scent of water, on the Syrian mosque"
1856,THALABA.,"""Placed with priest-mummery, and the jargon-rites"
1857,THALABA.,"""That fool the multitude, has led them here"
1858,THALABA.,"""From far Khorasan?[67] Allah who decreed"
1859,THALABA.,"""Yon tribe the plague and punishment of man,"
1860,THALABA.,"""These also hath he doomed to meet their way:"
1861,THALABA.,"""Both passive instruments"
1862,THALABA.,"""Of his all-acting will,"
1863,THALABA.,"""Sole mover he, and only spring of all."""
1864,THALABA.,
1865,THALABA.,"While thus he spake, Oneiza's eye looks up"
1866,THALABA.,"Where one towards her flew,"
1867,THALABA.,"Satiate, for so it seemed, with sport and food."
1868,THALABA.,"The Bird flew over her,"
1869,THALABA.,"And as he past above,"
1870,THALABA.,From his relaxing grasp a Locust fell....
1871,THALABA.,"It fell upon the Maiden's robe,"
1872,THALABA.,"And feebly there it stood, recovering slow."
1873,THALABA.,
1874,THALABA.,The admiring girl surveyed
1875,THALABA.,His out-spread sails of green.
1876,THALABA.,"His gauzy underwings,"
1877,THALABA.,"One closely to the grass green body furled,"
1878,THALABA.,"One ruffled in the fall, and half unclosed."
1879,THALABA.,She viewed his jet-orbed eyes
1880,THALABA.,His glossy gorget bright
1881,THALABA.,Green-glittering in the sun;
1882,THALABA.,His plumy pliant horns
1883,THALABA.,"That, nearer as she gazed,"
1884,THALABA.,Bent tremblingly before her breath.
1885,THALABA.,She viewed his yellow-circled front
1886,THALABA.,With lines mysterious veined;
1887,THALABA.,"""And knowest thou what is written here,"
1888,THALABA.,"""My father?"" said the Maid."
1889,THALABA.,"""Look Thalaba! perchance these lines"
1890,THALABA.,"""Are in the letters of the Ring,"
1891,THALABA.,"""Nature's own language written here."""
1892,THALABA.,
1893,THALABA.,"The youth bent down, and suddenly"
1894,THALABA.,"He started, and his heart"
1895,THALABA.,"Sprung, and his cheek grew red,"
1896,THALABA.,"For the mysterious[68] lines were legible,"
1897,"WHEN THE SUN SHALL BE DARKENED AT NOON,","WHEN THE SUN SHALL BE DARKENED AT NOON,"
1898,"SON OF HODEIRAH, DEPART.","SON OF HODEIRAH, DEPART."
1899,"SON OF HODEIRAH, DEPART.","And Moath looked, and read the lines aloud;"
1900,"SON OF HODEIRAH, DEPART.","The Locust shook his wings and fled,"

2331,LOBABA.,Or deemest thou that Heaven in anger formed
2332,LOBABA.,"Iron to till the field, because when man"
2333,LOBABA.,"Had tipt his arrows for the chase, he rushed"
2334,LOBABA.,A murderer to the war?
2335,LOBABA.,
2336,THALABA.,THALABA.
2337,THALABA.,
2338,THALABA.,What follows hence?
2339,THALABA.,
2340,LOBABA.,LOBABA.
2341,LOBABA.,
2342,LOBABA.,"That nothing in itself is good or evil,"
2343,LOBABA.,But only in its use. Think you the man
2344,LOBABA.,Praiseworthy who by painful study learns
2345,LOBABA.,"The knowledge of all simples, and their power"
2346,LOBABA.,Healing or harmful?
2347,LOBABA.,
2348,THALABA.,THALABA.
2349,THALABA.,
2350,THALABA.,All men hold in honour
2351,THALABA.,The skilful Leech. From land to land he goes
2352,THALABA.,Safe in his privilege; the sword of war
2353,THALABA.,"Spares him, Kings welcome him with costly gifts,"
2354,THALABA.,And he who late had from the couch of pain
2355,THALABA.,"Lifted a languid look to him for aid,"
2356,THALABA.,"Views him with brightened eyes, and blesses him"
2357,THALABA.,In his first thankful prayer.
2358,THALABA.,
2359,LOBABA.,LOBABA.
2360,LOBABA.,
2361,LOBABA.,Yet some there are
2362,LOBABA.,"Who to the purposes of wickedness,"
2363,LOBABA.,"Apply this knowledge, and from herbs distil"
2364,LOBABA.,Poison to mix it in the trusted draught.
2365,LOBABA.,
2366,THALABA.,THALABA.
2367,THALABA.,
2368,THALABA.,Allah shall cast them in the fire
2369,THALABA.,Whose fuel is the cursed! there shall they
2370,THALABA.,Endure the ever-burning agony
2371,THALABA.,"Consuming[75] still in flames, and still renewed."
2372,THALABA.,
2373,LOBABA.,LOBABA.
2374,LOBABA.,
2375,LOBABA.,But is their knowledge therefore in itself
2376,LOBABA.,Unlawful?
2377,LOBABA.,
2378,THALABA.,THALABA.
2379,THALABA.,
2380,THALABA.,That were foolishness to think.
2381,THALABA.,
2382,LOBABA.,LOBABA.
2383,LOBABA.,
2384,LOBABA.,"O what a glorious animal were Man,"
2385,LOBABA.,Knew he but his own powers! and knowing gave them
2386,LOBABA.,Room for their growth and spread! the Horse obeys
2387,LOBABA.,"His guiding will, the patient Camel bears him"
2388,LOBABA.,"Over these wastes of sand, the Pigeon wafts"
2389,LOBABA.,His bidding thro' the sky: and with these triumphs
2390,LOBABA.,"He rests contented! with these ministers,"
2391,LOBABA.,"When he might awe the Elements, and make"
2392,LOBABA.,Myriads of Spirits serve him!
2393,LOBABA.,
2394,THALABA.,THALABA.
2395,THALABA.,
2396,THALABA.,But as how!
2397,THALABA.,"By a league with Hell, a covenant that binds"
2398,THALABA.,The soul to utter death!
2399,THALABA.,
2400,LOBABA.,LOBABA.
2401,LOBABA.,
2402,LOBABA.,Was Solomon
2403,LOBABA.,Accurst of God? yet to his talismans
2404,LOBABA.,"Obedient, o'er his throne the birds of Heaven"
2405,LOBABA.,"Their waving wings[76] his sun-shield, fanned around him"
2406,LOBABA.,"The motionless air of noon: from place to place,"
2407,LOBABA.,As his will reined the viewless Element
2408,LOBABA.,"He rode the Wind: the Genii reared his temple,"
2409,LOBABA.,And ceaselessly in fear while his dead eye
2410,LOBABA.,"O'erlooked them, day and night pursued their toil,"
2411,LOBABA.,So dreadful was his power.
2412,LOBABA.,
2413,THALABA.,THALABA.
2414,THALABA.,
2415,THALABA.,But 'twas from Heaven
2416,THALABA.,His wisdom came; God's special gift ... the guerdon
2417,THALABA.,Of early virtue.
2418,THALABA.,
2419,LOBABA.,LOBABA.
2420,LOBABA.,
2421,LOBABA.,"Learn thou, O young man!"
2422,LOBABA.,God hath appointed Wisdom the reward
2423,LOBABA.,"Of study! 'tis a spring of living waters,"
2424,LOBABA.,Whose inexhaustible bounties all might drink
2425,LOBABA.,"But few dig deep enough. Son! thou art silent,..."
2426,LOBABA.,"Perhaps I say too much,... perhaps offend thee."
2427,LOBABA.,
2428,THALABA.,THALABA.
2429,THALABA.,
2430,THALABA.,"Nay, I am young, and willingly as becomes me,"
2431,THALABA.,Hear the wise words of age.
2432,THALABA.,
2433,LOBABA.,LOBABA.
2434,LOBABA.,
2435,LOBABA.,Is it a crime
2436,LOBABA.,"To mount the horse, because forsooth thy feet"
2437,LOBABA.,Can serve thee for the journey? is it sin
2438,LOBABA.,Because the Hern soars upward in the sky
2439,LOBABA.,"Above the arrow's flight, to train the Falcon"
2440,LOBABA.,Whose beak shall pierce him there? the powers which All
2441,LOBABA.,"Granted to man, were granted for his use;"
2442,LOBABA.,All knowledge that befits not human weakness
2443,LOBABA.,Is placed beyond its reach.... They who repair
2444,LOBABA.,"To Babylon, and from the Angels learn"
2445,LOBABA.,"Mysterious wisdom, sin not in the deed."
2446,LOBABA.,
2447,THALABA.,THALABA.
2448,THALABA.,
2449,THALABA.,Know you these secrets?
2450,THALABA.,
2451,LOBABA.,LOBABA.
2452,LOBABA.,
2453,LOBABA.,I? alas my Son
2454,LOBABA.,My age just knows enough to understand
2455,LOBABA.,How little all its knowledge! later years
2456,LOBABA.,"Sacred to study, teach me to regret"
2457,LOBABA.,"Youth's unforeseeing indolence, and hours"
2458,LOBABA.,That cannot be recalled! something I know:
2459,LOBABA.,"The properties of herbs, and have sometimes"
2460,LOBABA.,Brought to the afflicted comfort and relief
2461,LOBABA.,By the secrets of my art; under His blessing
2462,LOBABA.,Without whom all had failed! Also of Gems
2463,LOBABA.,"I have some knowledge, and the characters"
2464,LOBABA.,That tell beneath what aspect they were set.
2465,LOBABA.,
2466,THALABA.,THALABA.
2467,THALABA.,
2468,THALABA.,Belike you can interpret then the graving
2469,THALABA.,Around this Ring?
2470,THALABA.,
2471,LOBABA.,LOBABA.
2472,LOBABA.,
2473,LOBABA.,"My sight is feeble, Son,"
2474,LOBABA.,"And I must view it closer, let me try!"
2475,LOBABA.,
2476,LOBABA.,The unsuspecting Youth
2477,LOBABA.,Held forth his linger to draw off the spell.
2478,LOBABA.,"Even whilst he held it forth,"
2479,LOBABA.,"There settled there a Wasp,"
2480,LOBABA.,And just above the Gem infixed its dart.
2481,LOBABA.,All purple swoln the hot and painful flesh
2482,LOBABA.,Rose round the tightened Ring.
2483,LOBABA.,"The baffled Sorcerer knew the hand of Heaven,"
2484,LOBABA.,And inwardly blasphemed.
2485,LOBABA.,
2486,LOBABA.,"Ere long Lobaba's heart,"
2487,LOBABA.,"Fruitful in wiles, devised new stratagem."
2488,LOBABA.,A mist arose at noon;
2489,LOBABA.,Like the loose hanging skirts
2490,LOBABA.,"Of some low cloud that, by the breeze impelled,"
2491,LOBABA.,Sweeps o'er the mountain side.
2492,LOBABA.,With joy the thoughtless youth
2493,LOBABA.,That grateful shadowing hailed;
2494,LOBABA.,"For grateful was the shade,"
2495,LOBABA.,While thro' the silver-lighted haze
2496,LOBABA.,"Guiding their way, appeared the beamless Sun."
2497,LOBABA.,But soon that beacon failed;
2498,LOBABA.,A heavier mass of cloud
2499,LOBABA.,"Impenetrably deep,"
2500,LOBABA.,Hung o'er the wilderness.
2501,LOBABA.,"""Knowest thou the track?"" quoth Thalaba,"
2502,LOBABA.,"""Or should we pause, and wait the wind"
2503,LOBABA.,"""To scatter this bewildering fog?"""
2504,LOBABA.,The Sorcerer answered him
2505,LOBABA.,"""Now let us hold right on,... for if we stray"
2506,LOBABA.,"""The Sun tomorrow will direct our course."""
2507,LOBABA.,"So saying, he towards the desert depths"
2508,LOBABA.,Misleads the youth deceived.
2509,LOBABA.,
2510,LOBABA.,"Earlier the night came on,"
2511,LOBABA.,"Nor moon, nor stars, were visible in Heaven;"
2512,LOBABA.,And when at morn the youth unclosed his eyes
2513,LOBABA.,He knew not where to turn his face in prayer.
2514,LOBABA.,"""What shall we do?"" Lobaba cried,"
2515,LOBABA.,"""The lights of Heaven have ceased"
2516,LOBABA.,"""To guide us on our way."
2517,LOBABA.,"""Should we remain and wait"
2518,LOBABA.,"""More favourable skies?"
2519,LOBABA.,"""Soon would our food and water fail us here!"
2520,LOBABA.,"""And if we venture on,"
2521,LOBABA.,"""There are the dangers of the wilderness!"""
2522,LOBABA.,"""Sure it were best proceed!"""
2523,LOBABA.,The chosen youth replies.
2524,LOBABA.,"""So haply we may reach some tent, or grove"
2525,LOBABA.,"""Of dates, or stationed tribe."
2526,LOBABA.,"""But idly to remain"
2527,LOBABA.,"""Were yielding effortless, and waiting death."""
2528,LOBABA.,"The wily Sorcerer willingly assents,"
2529,LOBABA.,"And farther in the sands,"
2530,LOBABA.,"Elate of heart, he leads the credulous youth."
2531,LOBABA.,
2532,LOBABA.,Still o'er the wilderness
2533,LOBABA.,Settled the moveless mist.
2534,LOBABA.,The timid Antelope that heard their steps
2535,LOBABA.,"Stood doubtful where to turn in that dim light,"
2536,LOBABA.,"The Ostrich, blindly hastening, met them full."
2537,LOBABA.,"At night again in hope,"
2538,LOBABA.,Young Thalaba laid down;
2539,LOBABA.,"The morning came, and not one guiding ray"
2540,LOBABA.,"Thro' the thick mist was visible,"
2541,LOBABA.,The same deep moveless mist that mantled all.
2542,LOBABA.,Oh for the Vulture's scream
2543,LOBABA.,That haunts for prey the abode of humankind!
2544,LOBABA.,Oh for the Plover's[77] pleasant cry
2545,LOBABA.,To tell of water near!
2546,LOBABA.,Oh for the Camel-driver's[78] song!
2547,LOBABA.,"For now the water-skin grows light,"
2548,LOBABA.,"Tho' of the draught, more eagerly desired,"
2549,LOBABA.,Imperious prudence took with sparing thirst.
2550,LOBABA.,"Oft from the third night's broken sleep,"
2551,LOBABA.,As in his dreams he heard
2552,LOBABA.,"The sound of rushing winds,"
2553,LOBABA.,"Started the anxious youth, and looked abroad,"
2554,LOBABA.,In vain! for still the deadly calm endured.
2555,LOBABA.,"Another day past on,"
2556,LOBABA.,"The water-skin was drained,"
2557,LOBABA.,But then one hope arrived
2558,LOBABA.,For there was motion in the air!
2559,LOBABA.,The sound of the wind arose anon
2560,LOBABA.,"That scattered the thick mist,"
2561,LOBABA.,And lo! at length the lovely face of Heaven!
2562,LOBABA.,
2563,LOBABA.,Alas ... a wretched scene
2564,LOBABA.,Was opened on their view.
2565,LOBABA.,"They looked around, no wells were near,"
2566,LOBABA.,"No tent, no human aid!"
2567,LOBABA.,"Flat on the Camel lay the water-skin,"
2568,LOBABA.,"And their dumb servant difficultly now,"
2569,LOBABA.,"Over hot sands and under the hot sun,"
2570,LOBABA.,Dragged on with patient pain.
2571,LOBABA.,But oh the joy! the blessed sight!
2572,LOBABA.,When in the burning waste the Travellers
2573,LOBABA.,"Saw a green meadow, fair with flowers besprent,"
2574,LOBABA.,"Azure and yellow, like the beautiful fields"
2575,LOBABA.,"Of England, when amid the growing grass"
2576,LOBABA.,"The blue-bell bends, the golden king-cup shines,"
2577,LOBABA.,In the merry month of May!
2578,LOBABA.,Oh joy! the Travellers
2579,LOBABA.,"Gaze on each other with hope-brightened eyes,"
2580,LOBABA.,For sure thro' that green meadow flows
2581,LOBABA.,The living stream! and lo! their famished beast
2582,LOBABA.,Sees the restoring sight!
2583,LOBABA.,"Hope gives his feeble limbs a sudden strength,"
2584,LOBABA.,He hurries on!
2585,LOBABA.,The herbs so fair to eye
2586,LOBABA.,"Were Senna, and the Gentian's blossom blue,"
2587,LOBABA.,And kindred plants that with unwatered root
2588,LOBABA.,"Fed in the burning sand, whose bitter leaves"
2589,LOBABA.,Even frantic[79] Famine loathed.
2590,LOBABA.,
2591,LOBABA.,In uncommunicating misery
2592,LOBABA.,"Silent they stood. At length Lobaba cried,"
2593,LOBABA.,"""Son we must slay the Camel, or we die"
2594,LOBABA.,"""For lack of water! thy young hand is firm,"
2595,LOBABA.,"""Draw forth the knife and pierce him!"""
2596,LOBABA.,"Wretch accurst,"
2597,LOBABA.,"Who that beheld thy venerable face,"
2598,LOBABA.,"Thy features fixed with suffering, the dry lips,"
2599,LOBABA.,"The feverish eyes, could deem that all within"
2600,LOBABA.,"Was magic ease, and fearlessness secure,"
2601,LOBABA.,And wiles of hellish import? the young man
2602,LOBABA.,Paused with reluctant pity: but he saw
2603,LOBABA.,"His comrade's red and painful countenance,"
2604,LOBABA.,"And his own burning breath came short and quick,"
2605,LOBABA.,And at his feet the gasping beast
2606,LOBABA.,"Lies, over-worn with want."
2607,LOBABA.,Then from his[80] girdle Thalaba took the knife
2608,LOBABA.,"With stern compassion, and from side to side"
2609,LOBABA.,"Across[81] the Camel's throat,"
2610,LOBABA.,Drew deep the crooked blade.
2611,LOBABA.,"Servant of man, that merciful deed"
2612,LOBABA.,"For ever ends thy suffering, but what doom"
2613,LOBABA.,"Waits thy deliverer! ""little will thy death"
2614,LOBABA.,"""Avail us!"" thought the youth,"
2615,LOBABA.,As in the water-skin he poured
2616,LOBABA.,The Camel's hoarded draught:
2617,LOBABA.,"It gave a scant supply,"
2618,LOBABA.,The poor allowance of one prudent day.
2619,LOBABA.,
2620,LOBABA.,"Son of Hodeirah, tho' thy steady soul"
2621,LOBABA.,"Despaired not, firm in faith,"
2622,LOBABA.,Yet not the less did suffering Nature feel
2623,LOBABA.,"Her pangs and trials, long their craving thirst"
2624,LOBABA.,"Struggled with fear, by fear itself inflamed;"
2625,LOBABA.,"But drop by drop, that poor,"
2626,LOBABA.,That last supply is drained!
2627,LOBABA.,Still the same burning sun! no cloud in heaven!
2628,LOBABA.,"The hot air quivers, and the sultry mist"
2629,LOBABA.,"Floats o'er the desert, with a show"
2630,LOBABA.,"Of distant[82] waters, mocking their distress!"
2631,LOBABA.,"The youth's parched lips were black,"
2632,LOBABA.,"His tongue was[83] dry and rough,"
2633,LOBABA.,His eye-balls red with heat.
2634,LOBABA.,His comrade gazed on him with looks
2635,LOBABA.,"That seemed to speak of pity, and he said"
2636,LOBABA.,"""Let me behold thy Ring,"
2637,LOBABA.,"""It may have virtue that can save us yet!"""
2638,LOBABA.,With that he took his hand
2639,LOBABA.,"And viewed the writing close,"
2640,LOBABA.,Then cried with sudden joy
2641,LOBABA.,"""It is a stone that whoso bears"
2642,LOBABA.,"""The Genii must obey!"
2643,LOBABA.,"""Now raise thy voice, my Son,"
2644,LOBABA.,"""And bid them in his name that here is written"
2645,LOBABA.,"""Preserve us in our need."""
2646,LOBABA.,
2647,LOBABA.,"""Nay!"" answered Thalaba,"
2648,LOBABA.,"""Shall I distrust the providence of God?"
2649,LOBABA.,"""Is it not He must save?"
2650,LOBABA.,"""If Allah wills it not"
2651,LOBABA.,"""Vain were the Genii's aid."""
2652,LOBABA.,
2653,LOBABA.,Whilst he spake Lobaba's eye
2654,LOBABA.,"Full on the distance fixed,"
2655,LOBABA.,Attended not his speech.
2656,LOBABA.,Its fearful meaning drew
2657,LOBABA.,The looks of Thalaba.
2658,LOBABA.,"Columns of sand came moving on,"
2659,LOBABA.,Red in the burning ray
2660,LOBABA.,Like obelisks of fire
2661,LOBABA.,They rushed before the driving wind.
2662,LOBABA.,Vain were all thoughts of flight!
2663,LOBABA.,They had not hoped escape
2664,LOBABA.,Could they have backed the Dromedary then
2665,LOBABA.,Who in his rapid race
2666,LOBABA.,"Gives to the tranquil[84] air, a drowning force."
2667,LOBABA.,
2668,LOBABA.,High ... high in heaven upcurled
2669,LOBABA.,"The dreadful[85] columns moved,"
2670,LOBABA.,"Swift, as the whirlwind that impelled their way,"
2671,LOBABA.,They rushed towards the Travellers!
2672,LOBABA.,"The old Magician shrieked,"
2673,LOBABA.,"And lo! the foremost bursts,"
2674,LOBABA.,"Before the whirlwind's force,"
2675,LOBABA.,Scattering afar a burning shower of sand.
2676,LOBABA.,"""Now by the virtue of the Ring"
2677,LOBABA.,"""Save us!"" Lobaba cried."
2678,LOBABA.,"""While yet thou hast the power"
2679,LOBABA.,"""Save us. O save us! now!"""
2680,LOBABA.,"The youth made no reply,"
2681,LOBABA.,Gazing in aweful wonder on the scene.
2682,LOBABA.,
2683,LOBABA.,"""Why dost thou wait?"" the Old Man exclaimed,"
2684,LOBABA.,"""If Allah and the Prophet will not save"
2685,LOBABA.,"""Call on the Powers that will!"""
2686,LOBABA.,
2687,LOBABA.,"""Ha! do I know thee, Infidel accurst?"""
2688,LOBABA.,Exclaimed the awakened youth.
2689,LOBABA.,"""And thou hast led me hither, Child of Sin!"
2690,LOBABA.,"""That fear might make me sell"
2691,LOBABA.,"""My soul to endless death!"""
2692,LOBABA.,
2693,LOBABA.,"""Fool that thou art!"" Lobaba cried,"
2694,LOBABA.,"""Call upon him whose name"
2695,LOBABA.,"""Thy charmed signet bears,"
2696,LOBABA.,"""Or die the death thy foolishness deserves!"""
2697,LOBABA.,
2698,LOBABA.,"""Servant of Hell! die thou!"" quoth Thalaba."
2699,LOBABA.,And leaning on his bow
2700,LOBABA.,"He fitted the loose string,"
2701,LOBABA.,And laid the arrow in its resting-place.
2702,LOBABA.,"""Bow of my Father, do thy duty now!"""
2703,LOBABA.,"He drew the arrow to its point,"
2704,LOBABA.,"True to his eye it fled,"
2705,LOBABA.,And full upon the breast
2706,LOBABA.,It smote the wizard man.
2707,LOBABA.,Astonished Thalaba beheld
2708,LOBABA.,The blunted point recoil.
2709,LOBABA.,
2710,LOBABA.,A proud and bitter smile
2711,LOBABA.,"Wrinkled Lobaba's cheek,"
2712,LOBABA.,"""Try once again thine earthly arms!"" he cried."
2713,LOBABA.,"""Rash Boy! the Power I serve"
2714,LOBABA.,"""Abandons not his votaries."
2715,LOBABA.,"""It is for Allah's wretched slaves, like thou,"
2716,LOBABA.,"""To serve a master, who in the hour of need"
2717,LOBABA.,"""Forsakes them to their fate!"
2718,LOBABA.,"""I leave thee!""... and he shook his staff, and called"
2719,LOBABA.,The Chariot of his Charms.
2720,LOBABA.,
2721,LOBABA.,"Swift as the viewless wind,"
2722,LOBABA.,"Self-moved, the Chariot came,"
2723,LOBABA.,The Sorcerer mounts the seat.
2724,LOBABA.,"""Yet once more weigh thy danger!"" he exclaimed,"
2725,LOBABA.,"""Ascend the car with me,"
2726,LOBABA.,"""And with the speed of thought"
2727,LOBABA.,"""We pass the desert bounds."""
2728,LOBABA.,"The indignant youth vouchsafed not to reply,"
2729,LOBABA.,And lo! the magic car begins its course!
2730,LOBABA.,Hark! hark!... he screams.... Lobaba screams!
2731,LOBABA.,"What wretch, and hast thou raised"
2732,LOBABA.,The rushing Terrors of the Wilderness
2733,LOBABA.,To fall on thine own head?
2734,LOBABA.,Death! death! inevitable death!
2735,LOBABA.,Driven by the breath of God
2736,LOBABA.,A column of the Desert met his way.

2758,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"To that delightful shower,"
2759,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And felt the coolness flow thro' every limb
2760,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Freshening his powers of life.
2761,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2762,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"A loud quick panting! Thalaba looks up,"
2763,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"He starts, and his instinctive hand"
2764,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Grasps the knife hilt: for close beside
2765,THE FIFTH BOOK.,A Tyger passes him.
2766,THE FIFTH BOOK.,An indolent and languid eye
2767,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The passing Tyger turned;
2768,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"His head was hanging down,"
2769,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"His dry tongue lolling low,"
2770,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And the short panting of his fevered breath
2771,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Came thro' his hot parched nostrils painfully.
2772,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The young Arabian knew
2773,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The purport of his hurried pace,"
2774,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And following him in hope
2775,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Saw joyful from afar
2776,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The Tyger stoop and drink.
2777,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2778,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The desert Pelican had built her nest
2779,THE FIFTH BOOK.,In that deep solitude.
2780,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And now returned from distant flight
2781,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Fraught with the river stream,"
2782,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Her load of water had disburthened there.
2783,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Her young in the refreshing bath
2784,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Sported all wantonness;
2785,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Dipt down their callow heads,"
2786,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Filled the swoln membrane from their plumeless throat
2787,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Pendant, and bills yet soft,"
2788,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"And buoyant with arched breast,"
2789,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Plied in unpractised stroke
2790,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The oars of their broad feet.
2791,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"They, as the spotted prowler of the wild"
2792,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Laps the cool wave, around their mother croud,"
2793,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And nestle underneath her outspread wings.
2794,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The spotted prowler of the wild
2795,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Lapt the cool wave,[86] and satiate from the nest,"
2796,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Guiltless of blood, withdrew."
2797,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2798,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The mother bird had moved not
2799,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"But cowering o'er her nestlings,"
2800,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Sate confident and fearless,"
2801,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And watched the wonted guest.
2802,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"But when the human visitant approached,"
2803,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The alarmed Pelican
2804,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Retiring from that hostile shape,"
2805,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Gathers her young, and menaces with wings,"
2806,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"And forward thrusts her threatening neck,"
2807,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Its feathers ruffling in her wrath,"
2808,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Bold with maternal fear.
2809,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Thalaba drank and in the water-skin
2810,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Hoarded the precious element.
2811,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Not all he took, but in the large nest left"
2812,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Store that sufficed for life.
2813,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"And journeying onward blest the Carrier Bird,"
2814,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"And blest in thankfulness,"
2815,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Their common Father, provident for all."
2816,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2817,THE FIFTH BOOK.,With strength renewed and confident in faith
2818,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The son of Hodeirah proceeds;
2819,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Till after the long toil of many a day,"
2820,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"At length Bagdad appeared,"
2821,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The City of his search.
2822,THE FIFTH BOOK.,He hastening to the gate
2823,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Roams o'er the city with insatiate eyes,"
2824,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Its thousand dwellings o'er whose level roofs
2825,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Fair cupolas appeared, and high-domed mosques"
2826,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"And pointed minarets, and cypress groves"
2827,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Every where scattered[87] in unwithering green.
2828,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2829,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Thou too art fallen, Bagdad! City of[88] Peace,"
2830,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Thou too hast had thy day!
2831,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And loathsome Ignorance and brute Servitude
2832,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Pollute thy dwellings now,"
2833,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Erst for the Mighty and the Wise renowned.
2834,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"O yet illustrious for remembered fame,"
2835,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Thy founder the [89]Victorious, and the pomp"
2836,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Of Haroun, for whose name by blood defiled,"
2837,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Jahia's, and the blameless Barmecides',"
2838,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Genius hath wrought salvation; and the years
2839,THE FIFTH BOOK.,When Science with the good Al-Maimon dwelt;
2840,THE FIFTH BOOK.,So one day may the Crescent from thy Mosques
2841,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Be plucked by Wisdom, when the enlightened arm"
2842,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Of Europe conquers to redeem the East.
2843,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2844,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Then Pomp and Pleasure dwelt within her walls
2845,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The Merchants of the East and of the West
2846,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Met in her arched[90] Bazars;
2847,THE FIFTH BOOK.,All day the active poor
2848,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Showered a cool comfort o'er her thronging streets;
2849,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Labour was busy in her looms;
2850,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Thro' all her open gates
2851,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Long troops of laden Camels lined her roads,"
2852,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And Tigris on his tameless[91] current bore
2853,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Armenian harvests to her multitudes.
2854,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2855,THE FIFTH BOOK.,But not in sumptuous Caravansary
2856,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The adventurer idles there,"
2857,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Nor satiates wonder with her pomp and wealth;
2858,THE FIFTH BOOK.,A long day's distance from the walls
2859,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Stands ruined Babylon!
2860,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The time of action is at hand,"
2861,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The hope that for so many a year
2862,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Hath been his daily thought, his nightly dream,"
2863,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Stings to more restlessness.
2864,THE FIFTH BOOK.,He loathes all lingering that delays the hour
2865,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"When, full of glory, from his quest returned,"
2866,THE FIFTH BOOK.,He on the pillar of the Tent beloved
2867,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Shall hang Hodeirah's sword.
2868,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2869,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The many-coloured[92] domes
2870,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Yet wore one dusky hue,"
2871,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The Cranes upon the Mosque
2872,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Kept their night-clatter[93] still,"
2873,THE FIFTH BOOK.,When thro' the gate the early Traveller past.
2874,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And when at evening o'er the swampy plain
2875,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The Bittern's[94] Boom came far,"
2876,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Distinct in darkness seen
2877,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Above the low horizon's lingering light
2878,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Rose the near ruins of old Babylon.
2879,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2880,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Once from her lofty walls[95] the Charioteer
2881,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Looked down on swarming myriads; once she flung
2882,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Her arches o'er Euphrates conquered tide,"
2883,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And thro' her brazen portals when she poured
2884,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Her armies forth, the distant nations looked"
2885,THE FIFTH BOOK.,As men who watched the thunder-cloud in fear
2886,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Lest it should burst above them. She was fallen,"
2887,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The Queen of Cities, Babylon was fallen!"
2888,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Low lay her bulwarks; the black scorpion basked
2889,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"In the palace courts, within her sanctuary"
2890,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The She Wolf hid her whelps.
2891,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Is yonder huge and shapeless heap, what once"
2892,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Had been the aerial[96] Gardens, height on height"
2893,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Rising like Medias mountains crowned with wood,"
2894,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Work of imperial dotage? where the fame
2895,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Of[97] Belus? where the Golden Image now,"
2896,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Which at the sound of dulcimer and lute,"
2897,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Cornet and sackbut, harp and psaltery,"
2898,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The Assyrian slaves adored?
2899,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"A labyrinth of ruins, Babylon"
2900,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Spreads o'er the blasted plain:
2901,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The wandering Arab never sets his tent
2902,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Within her walls; the Shepherd[98] eyes afar
2903,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Her evil Towers, and devious drives his flock."
2904,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Alone unchanged, a free and bridgeless tide"
2905,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Euphrates rolls along,"
2906,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Eternal Nature's work.
2907,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2908,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Thro' the broken portal,"
2909,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Over weedy fragments,"
2910,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Thalaba went his way.
2911,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Cautious he trod, and felt"
2912,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The dangerous ground before him with his bow.
2913,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The Chacal started at his steps,"
2914,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The Stork, alarmed at sound of man,"
2915,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"From her broad nest upon the old pillar top,"
2916,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Affrighted fled on flapping wings.
2917,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The Adder in her haunts disturbed
2918,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Lanced at the intruding staff her arrowy tongue.
2919,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2920,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Twilight and moonshine dimly mingling gave
2921,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"An aweful light obscure,"
2922,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Evening not wholly closed,"
2923,THE FIFTH BOOK.,The Moon still pale and faint.
2924,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"An aweful light obscure,"
2925,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Broken by many a mass of blackest shade;
2926,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Long column stretching dark thro' weeds and moss,"
2927,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Broad length of lofty wall
2928,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Whose windows lay in light,"
2929,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"And of their former shape, low-arched or square,"
2930,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Rude outline on the earth
2931,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Figured, with long grass fringed."
2932,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2933,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Reclined against a column's broken shaft,"
2934,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Unknowing whitherward to bend his way
2935,THE FIFTH BOOK.,He stood and gazed around.
2936,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The Ruins closed him in,"
2937,THE FIFTH BOOK.,It seemed as if no foot of man
2938,THE FIFTH BOOK.,For ages had intruded there.
2939,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Soon at approaching step
2940,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Starting, he turned and saw"
2941,THE FIFTH BOOK.,A warrior in the moon beam drawing near.
2942,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Forward the Stranger came
2943,THE FIFTH BOOK.,And with a curious eye
2944,THE FIFTH BOOK.,Perused the Arab youth.
2945,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""And who art thou,"" he cried,"
2946,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""That at an hour like this"
2947,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""Wanderest in Babylon?"
2948,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""A way-bewildered traveller, seekest thou"
2949,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""The ruinous shelter here?"
2950,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""Or comest thou to hide"
2951,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""The plunder of the night?"
2952,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""Or hast thou spells to make"
2953,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""These ruins, yawning from their rooted base"
2954,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""Disclose their secret[99] wealth?"""
2955,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2956,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The youth replied, ""nor wandering traveller"
2957,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""Nor robber of the night"
2958,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""Nor skilled in spells am I."
2959,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""I seek the Angels here,"
2960,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""Haruth and Maruth. Stranger in thy turn,"
2961,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""Why wanderest thou in Babylon,"
2962,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""And who art thou, the Questioner?"""
2963,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2964,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"The man was fearless, and the tempered pride"
2965,THE FIFTH BOOK.,That toned the voice of Thalaba
2966,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Displeased not him, himself of haughty heart."
2967,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"Heedless he answered, ""knowest thou"
2968,THE FIFTH BOOK.,"""Their cave of punishment?"""
2969,THE FIFTH BOOK.,
2970,THALABA.,THALABA.
2971,THALABA.,
2972,THALABA.,Vainly I seek it.
2973,THALABA.,
2974,STRANGER.,STRANGER.
2975,STRANGER.,
2976,STRANGER.,Art thou firm of foot
2977,STRANGER.,To tread the ways of danger?
2978,STRANGER.,
2979,THALABA.,THALABA.
2980,THALABA.,
2981,THALABA.,Point the path!
2982,THALABA.,
2983,STRANGER.,STRANGER.
2984,STRANGER.,
2985,STRANGER.,Young Arab! if thou hast a heart can beat
2986,STRANGER.,"Evenly in danger, if thy bowels yearn not"
2987,STRANGER.,"With human fears, at scenes where undisgraced"
2988,STRANGER.,The soldier tried in battle might look back
2989,STRANGER.,"And tremble, follow me!... for I am bound"
2990,STRANGER.,Into that cave of horrors.
2991,STRANGER.,Thalaba
2992,STRANGER.,"Gazed on his comrade, he was young, of port"
2993,STRANGER.,Stately and strong; belike his face had pleased
2994,STRANGER.,"A woman's eye, yet the youth read in it"
2995,STRANGER.,"Unrestrained passions, the obdurate soul"
2996,STRANGER.,"Bold in all evil daring; and it taught,"
2997,STRANGER.,"By Nature's irresistible instinct, doubt"
2998,STRANGER.,"Well timed and wary. Of himself assured,"
2999,STRANGER.,"Fearless of man, and confident in faith,"
3000,STRANGER.,"""Lead on!"" cried Thalaba."
3001,STRANGER.,Mohareb led the way;
3002,STRANGER.,"And thro' the ruined streets,"
3003,STRANGER.,And thro' the farther gate
3004,STRANGER.,They past in silence on.
3005,STRANGER.,
3006,STRANGER.,What sound is borne on the wind?
3007,STRANGER.,Is it the storm that shakes
3008,STRANGER.,The thousand oaks of the forest?
3009,STRANGER.,But Thalaba's long locks
3010,STRANGER.,"Flow down his shoulders moveless, and the wind"
3011,STRANGER.,In his loose mantle raises not one fold.
3012,STRANGER.,Is it the river's roar
3013,STRANGER.,Dashed down some rocky descent?
3014,STRANGER.,Along the level plain
3015,STRANGER.,Euphrates glides unheard.
3016,STRANGER.,"What sound disturbs the night,"
3017,STRANGER.,"Loud as the summer forest in the storm,"
3018,STRANGER.,As the river that roars among rocks?
3019,STRANGER.,
3020,STRANGER.,And what the heavy cloud
3021,STRANGER.,"That hangs upon the vale,"
3022,STRANGER.,Thick as the mist o'er a well-watered plain
3023,STRANGER.,"Settling at evening, when the cooler air"
3024,STRANGER.,Lets its day-vapours fall;
3025,STRANGER.,Black as the sulphur-cloud
3026,STRANGER.,"That thro' Vesuvius, or from Hecla's mouth"
3027,STRANGER.,"Rolls up, ascending from the infernal fires."
3028,STRANGER.,
3029,STRANGER.,From Ait's bitumen[100] lake
3030,STRANGER.,That heavy cloud ascends;
3031,STRANGER.,That everlasting roar
3032,STRANGER.,From where its gushing springs
3033,STRANGER.,Boil their black billows up.
3034,STRANGER.,"Silent the Arab youth,"
3035,STRANGER.,"Along the verge of that wide lake,"
3036,STRANGER.,Followed Mohareb's way
3037,STRANGER.,Towards a ridge of rocks that banked its side.
3038,STRANGER.,"There from a cave with torrent force,"
3039,STRANGER.,"And everlasting roar,"
3040,STRANGER.,The black bitumen rolled.
3041,STRANGER.,The moonlight lay upon the rocks.
3042,STRANGER.,"Their crags were visible,"
3043,STRANGER.,"The shade of jutting cliffs,"
3044,STRANGER.,"And where broad lichens whitened some smooth spot,"
3045,STRANGER.,And where the ivy hung
3046,STRANGER.,Its flowing tresses down.
3047,STRANGER.,A little way within the cave
3048,STRANGER.,"The moonlight fell, glossing the sable tide"
3049,STRANGER.,That gushed tumultuous out.
3050,STRANGER.,"A little way it entered, then the rock"
3051,STRANGER.,"Arching its entrance, and the winding way,"
3052,STRANGER.,Darkened the unseen depths.
3053,STRANGER.,No eye of mortal man
3054,STRANGER.,"If unenabled by enchanted spell,"
3055,STRANGER.,Had pierced those fearful depths.
3056,STRANGER.,For mingling with the roar
3057,STRANGER.,"Of the portentous torrent, oft were heard"
3058,STRANGER.,"Shrieks, and wild yells that scared"
3059,STRANGER.,The brooding Eagle from her midnight nest.
3060,STRANGER.,The affrighted countrymen
3061,STRANGER.,Call it the Mouth of Hell;
3062,STRANGER.,And ever when their way leads near
3063,STRANGER.,"They hurry with averted eyes,"
3064,STRANGER.,And dropping their beads[101] fast
3065,STRANGER.,Pronounce the holy name.
3066,STRANGER.,
3067,STRANGER.,There pausing at the cavern mouth
3068,STRANGER.,"Mohareb turned to Thalaba,"
3069,STRANGER.,"""Now darest thou enter in?"""
3070,STRANGER.,"""Behold!"" the youth replied,"
3071,STRANGER.,And leading in his turn the dangerous way
3072,STRANGER.,Set foot within the cave.
3073,STRANGER.,
3074,STRANGER.,"""Stay Madman!"" cried his comrade. ""Wouldst thou rush"
3075,STRANGER.,"""Headlong to certain death?"
3076,STRANGER.,"""Where are thine arms to meet"
3077,STRANGER.,"""The Guardian of the Passage?"" a loud shriek"
3078,STRANGER.,That shook along the windings of the cave
3079,STRANGER.,Scattered the youth's reply.
3080,STRANGER.,
3081,STRANGER.,Mohareb when the long reechoing ceased
3082,STRANGER.,"Exclaimed, ""Fate favoured thee,"
3083,STRANGER.,"""Young Arab! when she wrote[102] upon thy brow"
3084,STRANGER.,"""The meeting of to-night;"
3085,STRANGER.,"""Else surely had thy name"
3086,STRANGER.,"""This hour been blotted from the Book of Life!"""
3087,STRANGER.,
3088,STRANGER.,So saying from beneath
3089,STRANGER.,His cloak a bag he drew;
3090,STRANGER.,"""Young Arab! thou art brave,"" he cried,"
3091,STRANGER.,"""But thus to rush on danger unprepared,"
3092,STRANGER.,"""As lions spring upon the hunter's spear,"
3093,STRANGER.,"""Is blind, brute courage. Zohak[103] keeps the cave,"
3094,STRANGER.,"""Giantly tyrant of primeval days."
3095,STRANGER.,"""Force cannot win the passage."" Thus he said"
3096,STRANGER.,And from his wallet drew a human hand
3097,STRANGER.,"Shrivelled, and dry, and black,"
3098,STRANGER.,And fitting as he spake
3099,STRANGER.,"A taper in its hold,"
3100,STRANGER.,"Pursued: ""a murderer on the stake had died,"
3101,STRANGER.,"""I drove the Vulture from his limbs, and lopt"
3102,STRANGER.,"""The hand that did the murder, and drew up"
3103,STRANGER.,"""The tendon-strings to close its grasp,"
3104,STRANGER.,"""And in the sun and wind"
3105,STRANGER.,"""Parched it, nine weeks exposed."
3106,STRANGER.,"""The Taper,... but not here the place to impart,"
3107,STRANGER.,"""Nor hast thou done the rites,"
3108,STRANGER.,"""That fit thee to partake the mystery."
3109,STRANGER.,"""Look! it burns clear, but with the air around"
3110,STRANGER.,"""Its dead ingredients mingle deathiness."
3111,STRANGER.,"""This when the Keeper of the Cave shall feel,"
3112,STRANGER.,"""Maugre the doom of Heaven,"
3113,STRANGER.,"""The salutary[104] spell"
3114,STRANGER.,"""Shall lull his penal agony to sleep"
3115,STRANGER.,"""And leave the passage free."""
3116,STRANGER.,
3117,STRANGER.,Thalaba answered not.
3118,STRANGER.,"Nor was there time for answer now,"
3119,STRANGER.,"For lo! Mohareb leads,"
3120,STRANGER.,And o'er the vaulted cave
3121,STRANGER.,Trembles the accursed taper's feeble light.
3122,STRANGER.,There where the narrowing chasm
3123,STRANGER.,"Rose loftier in the hill,"
3124,STRANGER.,"Stood Zohak, wretched man, condemned to keep"
3125,STRANGER.,His Cave of punishment.
3126,STRANGER.,His was the frequent scream
3127,STRANGER.,Which far away the prowling Chacal heard
3128,STRANGER.,And howled in terror back:
3129,STRANGER.,For from his shoulders grew
3130,STRANGER.,"Two snakes of monster size,"
3131,STRANGER.,That ever at his head
3132,STRANGER.,Aimed eager their keen teeth
3133,STRANGER.,To satiate raving hunger with his brain.
3134,STRANGER.,He in the eternal conflict oft would seize
3135,STRANGER.,"Their swelling necks, and in his giant grasp"
3136,STRANGER.,"Bruise them, and rend their flesh with bloody nails,"
3137,STRANGER.,"And howl for agony,"
3138,STRANGER.,"Feeling the pangs he gave, for of himself"
3139,STRANGER.,"Inseparable parts, his torturers grew."
3140,STRANGER.,
3141,STRANGER.,To him approaching now
3142,STRANGER.,Mohareb held the withered arm
3143,STRANGER.,The Taper of enchanted power.
3144,STRANGER.,The unhallowed spell in hand unholy held
3145,STRANGER.,"Now ministered to mercy, heavily"
3146,STRANGER.,"The wretche's eyelids closed,"
3147,STRANGER.,And welcome and unfelt
3148,STRANGER.,Like the release of death
3149,STRANGER.,A sudden sleep fell on his vital powers.
3150,STRANGER.,
3151,STRANGER.,Yet tho' along the cave
3152,STRANGER.,"Lay Zohak's giant limbs,"
3153,STRANGER.,"The twin-born serpents kept the narrow pass,"
3154,STRANGER.,"Kindled their fiery eyes,"
3155,STRANGER.,"Darted their tongues of terror, and rolled out"
3156,STRANGER.,"Their undulating length,"
3157,STRANGER.,Like the long streamers of some gallant ship
3158,STRANGER.,"Buoyed on the wavy air,"
3159,STRANGER.,Still struggling to flow on and still withheld.
3160,STRANGER.,The scent of living flesh
3161,STRANGER.,Inflamed their appetite.
3162,STRANGER.,
3163,STRANGER.,Prepared for all the perils of the cave
3164,STRANGER.,Mohareb came. He from his wallet drew
3165,STRANGER.,Two human heads yet warm.
3166,STRANGER.,O hard of heart! whom not the visible power
3167,STRANGER.,"Of retributive Justice, and the doom"
3168,STRANGER.,"Of Zohak in his sight,"
3169,STRANGER.,Deterred from equal crime!
3170,STRANGER.,"Two human heads, yet warm, he laid"
3171,STRANGER.,Before the scaly guardians of the pass.
3172,STRANGER.,They to their wonted banquet of old years
3173,STRANGER.,"Turned eager, and the narrow pass was free."
3174,STRANGER.,
3175,STRANGER.,And now before their path
3176,STRANGER.,The opening cave dilates;
3177,STRANGER.,They reach a spacious vault
3178,STRANGER.,Where the black river fountains burst their way.
3179,STRANGER.,Now as a whirlwind's force
3180,STRANGER.,"Had centered on the spring,"
3181,STRANGER.,The gushing flood rolled up;
3182,STRANGER.,And now the deadened roar
3183,STRANGER.,"Echoed beneath them, as its sudden pause"
3184,STRANGER.,"Left wide a dark abyss,"
3185,STRANGER.,Adown whose fathomless gulphs the eye was lost.
3186,STRANGER.,Blue flames that hovered o'er the springs
3187,STRANGER.,Flung thro' the Cavern their uncertain light
3188,STRANGER.,"Now waving on the waves they lay,"
3189,STRANGER.,And now their fiery curls
3190,STRANGER.,"Flowed in long tresses up,"
3191,STRANGER.,And now contracting glowed with whiter heat.
3192,STRANGER.,Then up they poured again
3193,STRANGER.,Darting pale flashes thro' the tremulous air;
3194,STRANGER.,"The flames, the red and yellow sulphur-smoke,"
3195,STRANGER.,And the black darkness of the vault
3196,STRANGER.,Commingling indivisibly.
3197,STRANGER.,
3198,STRANGER.,"""Here,"" quoth Mohareb, ""do the Angels dwell,"
3199,STRANGER.,"""The Teachers of Enchantment."" Thalaba"
3200,STRANGER.,"Then raised his voice and cried,"
3201,STRANGER.,"""Haruth and Maruth, hear me! not with rites"
3202,STRANGER.,"""Accursed, to disturb your penitence"
3203,STRANGER.,"""And learn forbidden lore,"
3204,STRANGER.,"""Repentant Angels, seek I your abode."
3205,STRANGER.,"""Me Allah and the Prophet mission here,"
3206,STRANGER.,"""Their chosen servant I."
3207,STRANGER.,"""Tell me the Talisman.""..."
3208,STRANGER.,"""And dost thou think"""
3209,STRANGER.,"""Mohareb cried, as with a scornful smile"
3210,STRANGER.,"He glanced upon his comrade, ""dost thou think"
3211,STRANGER.,"""To trick them of their secret? for the dupes"
3212,STRANGER.,"""Of human-kind keep this lip-righteousness!"
3213,STRANGER.,"""'Twill serve thee in the Mosque"
3214,STRANGER.,"""And in the Market-place,"
3215,STRANGER.,"""But Spirits view the heart."
3216,STRANGER.,"""Only by strong and torturing spells enforced,"
3217,STRANGER.,"""Those stubborn Angels teach the charm"
3218,STRANGER.,"""By which we must descend."""
3219,STRANGER.,
3220,STRANGER.,"""Descend!"" said Thalaba."
3221,STRANGER.,But then the wrinkling smile
3222,STRANGER.,"Forsook Mohareb's cheek,"
3223,STRANGER.,And darker feelings settled on his brow.
3224,STRANGER.,"""Now by my soul,"" quoth he, ""and I believe"
3225,STRANGER.,"""Idiot! that I have led"
3226,STRANGER.,"""Some camel-kneed prayer-monger thro' the cave!"
3227,STRANGER.,"""What brings thee hither? thou shouldest have a hut"
3228,STRANGER.,"""By some Saint's[105] grave beside the public way,"
3229,STRANGER.,"""There to less-knowing fools"
3230,STRANGER.,"""Retail thy Koran[106] scraps,"
3231,STRANGER.,"""And in thy turn, die civet-like at last"
3232,STRANGER.,"""In the dung-perfume of thy sanctity!..."
3233,STRANGER.,"""Ye whom I seek! that, led by me,"
3234,STRANGER.,"""Feet uninitiate tread"
3235,STRANGER.,"""Your threshold, this atones!"
3236,STRANGER.,"""Fit sacrifice he falls!"""
3237,STRANGER.,"And forth he flashed his scymetar,"
3238,STRANGER.,And raised the murderous blow.
3239,STRANGER.,
3240,STRANGER.,"Then ceased his power; his lifted arm,"
3241,STRANGER.,"Suspended by the spell,"
3242,STRANGER.,Hung impotent to strike.
3243,STRANGER.,"""Poor Hypocrite!"" cried he,"
3244,STRANGER.,"""And this then is thy faith"
3245,STRANGER.,"""In Allah and the Prophet! they had failed"
3246,STRANGER.,"""To save thee, but for Magic's stolen aid;"
3247,STRANGER.,"""Yea, they had left thee yonder Serpent's meal,"
3248,STRANGER.,"""But that, in prudent cowardice,"
3249,STRANGER.,"""The chosen Servant of the Lord came in,"
3250,STRANGER.,"""Safe follower of my path!"""
3251,STRANGER.,
3252,STRANGER.,"""Blasphemer! dost thou boast of guiding me?"""
3253,STRANGER.,"Kindling with pride quoth Thalaba,"
3254,STRANGER.,"""Blindly the wicked work"
3255,STRANGER.,"""The righteous will of Heaven."
3256,STRANGER.,"""Sayest thou that diffident of God,"
3257,STRANGER.,"""In magic spell I trust?"
3258,STRANGER.,"""Liar! let witness this!"""
3259,STRANGER.,And he drew off Abdaldar's Ring
3260,STRANGER.,And cast it in the gulph.
3261,STRANGER.,A skinny hand came up
3262,STRANGER.,"And caught it as it fell,"
3263,STRANGER.,And peals of devilish laughter shook the Cave.
3264,STRANGER.,
3265,STRANGER.,"Then joy suffused Mohareb's cheek,"
3266,STRANGER.,And Thalaba beheld
3267,STRANGER.,"The blue blade gleam, descending to destroy."
3268,STRANGER.,
3269,STRANGER.,The undefended youth
3270,STRANGER.,"Sprung forward, and he seized"
3271,STRANGER.,"Mohareb in his grasp,"
3272,STRANGER.,And grappled with him breast to breast.
3273,STRANGER.,"Sinewy and large of limb Mohareb was,"
3274,STRANGER.,"Broad-shouldered, and his joints"
3275,STRANGER.,"Knit firm, and in the strife"
3276,STRANGER.,Of danger practised well.
3277,STRANGER.,Time had not thus matured young Thalaba:
3278,STRANGER.,"But now the enthusiast mind,"
3279,STRANGER.,The inspiration of his soul
3280,STRANGER.,Poured vigour like the strength
3281,STRANGER.,Of madness thro' his frame.
3282,STRANGER.,Mohareb reels before him! he right on
3283,STRANGER.,"With knee, with breast, with arm,"
3284,STRANGER.,Presses the staggering foe!
3285,STRANGER.,And now upon the brink
3286,STRANGER.,"Of that tremendous spring,"
3287,STRANGER.,There with fresh impulse and a rush of force
3288,STRANGER.,He thrust him from his hold.
3289,STRANGER.,The upwhirling flood received
3290,STRANGER.,"Mohareb, then, absorbed,"
3291,STRANGER.,Engulphed him in the abyss.
3292,STRANGER.,
3293,STRANGER.,"Thalaba's breath came fast,"
3294,STRANGER.,And panting he breathed out
3295,STRANGER.,A broken prayer of thankfulness.
3296,STRANGER.,"At length he spake and said,"
3297,STRANGER.,"""Haruth and Maruth! are ye here?"
3298,STRANGER.,"""Or has that evil guide misled my search?"
3299,STRANGER.,"""I, Thalaba, the Servant of the Lord,"
3300,STRANGER.,"""Invoke you. Hear me Angels! so may Heaven"
3301,STRANGER.,"""Accept and mitigate your penitence."
3302,STRANGER.,"""I go to root from earth the Sorcerer brood,"
3303,STRANGER.,"""Tell me the needful Talisman!"""
3304,STRANGER.,
3305,STRANGER.,"Thus as he spake, recumbent on the rock"
3306,STRANGER.,"Beyond the black abyss,"
3307,STRANGER.,Their forms grew visible.
3308,STRANGER.,"A settled sorrow sate upon their brows,"
3309,STRANGER.,"Sorrow alone, for trace of guilt and shame"
3310,STRANGER.,No more remained; and gradual as by prayer
3311,STRANGER.,"The sin was purged away,"
3312,STRANGER.,"Their robe[107] of glory, purified of stain"
3313,STRANGER.,Resumed the lustre of its native light.
3314,STRANGER.,
3315,STRANGER.,"In awe the youth received the answering voice,"
3316,STRANGER.,"""Son of Hodeirah! thou hast proved it here;"
3317,STRANGER.,"""The Talisman is Faith."""

3377,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"So from the inmost cavern, Thalaba"
3378,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Retrod the windings of the rock.
3379,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Still on the ground the giant limbs
3380,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Of Zohak were outstretched;
3381,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The spell of sleep had ceased
3382,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And his broad eyes were glaring on the youth:
3383,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Yet raised he not his arm to bar the way,"
3384,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Fearful to rouse the snakes
3385,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Now lingering o'er their meal.
3386,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3387,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Oh then, emerging from that dreadful cave,"
3388,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,How grateful did the gale of night
3389,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Salute his freshened sense!
3390,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"How full of lightsome joy,"
3391,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Thankful to Heaven, he hastens by the verge"
3392,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Of that bitumen lake,"
3393,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Whose black and heavy fumes,"
3394,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Surge heaving after surge,"
3395,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Rolled like the billowy and tumultuous sea.
3396,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3397,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The song of many a bird at morn
3398,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Aroused him from his rest.
3399,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Lo! by his side a courser stood!
3400,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"More animate of eye,"
3401,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Of form more faultless never had he seen,"
3402,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"More light of limbs and beautiful in strength,"
3403,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Among the race whose blood,"
3404,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Pure and unmingled, from the royal steeds"
3405,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Of [108]Solomon came down.
3406,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3407,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The chosen Arab's eye
3408,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Glanced o'er his graceful shape,"
3409,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"His rich caparisons,"
3410,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,His crimson trappings gay.
3411,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,But when he saw the mouth
3412,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Uncurbed, the unbridled neck,"
3413,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Then flushed his cheek, and leapt his heart,"
3414,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,For sure he deemed that Heaven had sent
3415,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The Courser, whom no erring hand should guide."
3416,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And lo! the eager Steed
3417,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Throws his head and paws the ground,"
3418,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Impatient of delay!
3419,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Then up leapt Thalaba
3420,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And away went the self-governed steed.
3421,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3422,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Far over the plain
3423,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Away went the bridleless steed;
3424,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"With the dew of the morning his fetlocks were wet,"
3425,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The foam frothed his limbs in the journey of noon,"
3426,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Nor stayed he till over the westerly heaven
3427,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The shadows of evening had spread.
3428,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Then on a sheltered bank
3429,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The appointed Youth reposed,"
3430,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And by him laid the docile courser down.
3431,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Again in the grey of the morning
3432,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Thalaba bounded up,"
3433,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Over hill, over dale"
3434,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Away goes the bridleless steed.
3435,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Again at eve he stops
3436,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Again the Youth descends.
3437,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"His load discharged, his errand done,"
3438,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Then bounded the courser away.
3439,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3440,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Heavy and dark the eve;
3441,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The Moon was hid on high,"
3442,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A dim light only tinged the mist
3443,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,That crost her in the path of Heaven.
3444,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"All living sounds had ceased,"
3445,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Only the flow of waters near was heard,"
3446,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A low and lulling melody.
3447,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Fasting, yet not of want"
3448,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Percipient, he on that mysterious steed"
3449,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Had reached his resting place,"
3450,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,For expectation kept his nature up.
3451,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The flow of waters now
3452,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Awoke a feverish thirst:
3453,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Led by the sound, he moved"
3454,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,To seek the grateful wave.
3455,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A meteor in the hazy air
3456,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Played before his path;
3457,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Before him now it rolled
3458,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A globe of livid fire;
3459,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And now contracted to a steady light,"
3460,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,As when the solitary hermit prunes
3461,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,His lamp's long undulating flame:
3462,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And now its wavy point
3463,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Up-blazing rose, like a young cypress-tree"
3464,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Swayed by the heavy wind;
3465,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Anon to Thalaba it moved,"
3466,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And wrapped him in its pale innocuous fire:
3467,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Now in the darkness drowned
3468,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Left him with eyes bedimmed,"
3469,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And now emerging[109] spread the scene to sight.
3470,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3471,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Led by the sound, and meteor-flame"
3472,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Advanced the Arab youth.
3473,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Now to the nearest of the many rills
3474,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,He stoops; ascending steam
3475,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Timely repels his hand,"
3476,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"For from its source it sprung, a boiling tide."
3477,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"A second course with better hap he tries,"
3478,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The wave intensly cold
3479,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Tempts to a copious draught.
3480,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"There was a virtue in the wave,"
3481,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"His limbs that stiff with toil,"
3482,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Dragged heavy, from the copious draught received"
3483,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Lightness and supple strength.
3484,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"O'erjoyed, and deeming the benignant Power"
3485,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Who sent the reinless steed,"
3486,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Had blessed the healing waters to his use
3487,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,He laid him down to sleep;
3488,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Lulled by the soothing and incessant sound,"
3489,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The flow of many waters, blending oft"
3490,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,With shriller tones and deep low murmurings
3491,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,That from the fountain caves
3492,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,In mingled melody
3493,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Like faery music, heard at midnight, came."
3494,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3495,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The sounds that last he heard at night
3496,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Awoke his sense at morn.
3497,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A scene of wonders lay before his eyes.
3498,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,In mazy windings o'er the vale
3499,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Wandered a thousand streams;
3500,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,They in their endless flow[110] had channelled deep
3501,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The rocky soil o'er which they ran,"
3502,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Veining its thousand islet stones,"
3503,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Like clouds that freckle o'er the summer sky,"
3504,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The blue etherial ocean circling each
3505,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And insulating all.
3506,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"A thousand shapes they wore, those islet stones,"
3507,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And Nature with her various tints
3508,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Varied anew their thousand forms:
3509,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"For some were green with moss,"
3510,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Some rich with yellow lichen's gold,"
3511,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Or ruddier tinged, or grey, or silver-white,"
3512,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Or sparkling sparry radiance to the sun.
3513,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Here gushed the fountains up,"
3514,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Alternate light and blackness, like the play"
3515,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Of sunbeams, on the warrior's burnished arms."
3516,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Yonder the river rolled, whose bed,"
3517,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Their labyrinthine lingerings o'er
3518,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Received the confluent rills.
3519,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3520,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"This was a wild and wonderous scene,"
3521,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Strange and beautiful, as where"
3522,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"By Oton-tala, like a sea[111] of stars,"
3523,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The hundred sources of Hoangho burst.
3524,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"High mountains closed the vale,"
3525,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Bare rocky mountains, to all living things"
3526,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Inhospitable, on whose sides no herb"
3527,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Rooted, no insect fed, no bird awoke"
3528,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Their echoes, save the Eagle, strong of wing,"
3529,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"A lonely plunderer, that afar"
3530,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Sought in the vales his prey.
3531,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3532,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Thither towards those mountains, Thalaba"
3533,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Advanced, for well he weened that there had Fate"
3534,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Destined the adventures end.
3535,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Up a wide vale winding amid their depths,"
3536,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A stony vale between receding heights
3537,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Of stone, he wound his way."
3538,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A cheerless place! the solitary Bee
3539,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Whose buzzing was the only sound of life
3540,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Flew there on restless wing,"
3541,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Seeking in vain one blossom, where to fix."
3542,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3543,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Still Thalaba holds on,"
3544,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The winding vale now narrows on his way,"
3545,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And steeper of ascent
3546,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Rightward and leftward rise the rocks,"
3547,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And now they meet across the vale.
3548,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Was it the toil of human hands
3549,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"That hewed a passage in the rock,"
3550,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Thro' whose rude portal-way
3551,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The light of heaven was seen?
3552,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Rude and low the portal-way,"
3553,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Beyond the same[112] ascending straits
3554,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Went winding up the wilds.
3555,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3556,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Still a bare, silent, solitary glen,"
3557,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A fearful silence and a solitude
3558,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,That made itself be felt.
3559,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And steeper now the ascent,"
3560,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"A rugged path, that tired"
3561,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The straining muscles, toiling slowly up."
3562,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,At length again a rock
3563,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Stretched o'er the narrow vale.
3564,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"There also was a portal hewn,"
3565,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"But gates of massy iron barred the way,"
3566,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Huge, solid, heavy-hinged."
3567,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3568,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"There hung a horn beside the gate,"
3569,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Ivory-tipt and brazen mouthed,"
3570,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"He took the ivory tip,"
3571,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And thro' the brazen mouth he breathed;
3572,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"From rock to rock rebounding rung the blast,"
3573,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Like a long thunder peal!
3574,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The gates of iron, by no human arm"
3575,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Unfolded, turning on their hinges slow,"
3576,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Disclosed the passage of the rock.
3577,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"He entered, and the iron gates"
3578,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Fell to, and closed him in."
3579,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"It was a narrow winding way,"
3580,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Dim lamps suspended from the vault
3581,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Lent to the gloom an agitated light.
3582,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Winding it pierced the rock,"
3583,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A long descending path
3584,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,By gates of iron closed;
3585,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,There also hung the horn beside
3586,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Of ivory tip and brazen mouth,"
3587,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Again he took the ivory tip
3588,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And gave the brazen mouth his voice again.
3589,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Not now in thunder spake the horn,"
3590,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,But poured a sweet and thrilling melody:
3591,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The gates flew open, and a flood of light"
3592,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Rushed on his dazzled eyes.
3593,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3594,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Was it to earthly Eden lost so long,"
3595,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The youth had found the wonderous way?
3596,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,But earthly Eden boasts
3597,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"No terraced palaces,"
3598,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,No rich pavilions bright with woven[113] gold.
3599,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Like these that in the vale
3600,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Rise amid odorous groves.
3601,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The astonished Thalaba
3602,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Doubting as tho' an unsubstantial dream
3603,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Beguiled his passive sense,"
3604,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A moment closed his eyes;
3605,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Still they were there ... the palaces and groves,"
3606,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And rich pavilions glittering golden light.
3607,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3608,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And lo! a man, reverend in comely age"
3609,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Advancing meets the youth.
3610,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""Favoured of Fortune,"" he exclaimed,"
3611,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""Go taste the joys of Paradise!"
3612,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""The reinless steed that ranges o'er the world"
3613,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""Brings hither those alone for lofty deeds"
3614,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""Marked by their horoscope; permitted here"
3615,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""A foretaste of the full beatitude,"
3616,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""That in heroic acts they may go on"
3617,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""More ardent, eager to return and reap"
3618,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""Endless enjoyment here, their destined meed."
3619,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""Favoured of Fortune thou,"
3620,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""Go taste the joys of Paradise!"""
3621,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3622,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"This said, he turned away, and left"
3623,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The Youth in wonder mute;
3624,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,For Thalaba stood mute
3625,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And passively received
3626,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The mingled joy that flowed on every sense.
3627,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Where'er his eye could reach
3628,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Fair structures, rain bow-hued, arose;"
3629,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And rich pavilions thro' the opening woods
3630,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Gleamed from their waving curtains sunny gold;
3631,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And winding thro' the verdant vale
3632,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Flowed streams of liquid light;
3633,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And fluted cypresses reared up
3634,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Their living obelisks;
3635,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And broad-leaved[114] Zennars in long colonades
3636,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"O'er-arched delightful walks,"
3637,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Where round their trunks the thousand-tendril'd vine
3638,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Wound up and hung the bows with greener wreaths,"
3639,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And clusters not their own.
3640,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Wearied with endless beauty did his eyes
3641,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Return for rest? beside him teems the earth
3642,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"With tulips, like the ruddy[115] evening streaked,"
3643,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And here the lily hangs her head of snow,"
3644,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And here amid her sable[116] cup
3645,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Shines the red eye-spot, like one brightest star"
3646,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The solitary twinkler of the night,"
3647,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And here the rose expands
3648,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Her paradise[117] of leaves.
3649,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3650,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Then on his ear what sounds
3651,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Of harmony arose!
3652,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Far music and the distance-mellowed song
3653,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,From bowers of merriment;
3654,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The waterfall remote;
3655,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The murmuring of the leafy groves;
3656,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The single nightingale
3657,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Perched in the Rosier by, so richly toned,"
3658,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"That never from that most melodious bird,"
3659,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Singing a love-song to his brooding mate,"
3660,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Did Thracian shepherd by the grave
3661,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Of Orpheus[118] hear a sweeter song;
3662,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Tho' there the Spirit of the Sepulchre
3663,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"All his own power infuse, to swell"
3664,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The incense that he loves.
3665,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3666,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And oh! what odours the voluptuous vale
3667,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Scatters from jasmine bowers.
3668,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"From yon rose wilderness,"
3669,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"From clustered henna, and from orange groves"
3670,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"That with such perfumes fill the breeze,"
3671,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"As Peris to their Sister bear,"
3672,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,When from the summit of some lofty tree
3673,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"She hangs encaged, the captive of the Dives."
3674,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,They from their pinions shake
3675,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The sweetness of celestial flowers,"
3676,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And as her enemies impure
3677,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,From that impervious poison far away
3678,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Fly groaning with the torment, she the while"
3679,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Inhales her fragrant[119] food.
3680,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Such odours flowed upon the world
3681,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"When at Mohammed's nuptials, word"
3682,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Went forth in Heaven to roll
3683,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The everlasting gates of Paradise
3684,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Back on their living hinges, that its gales"
3685,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Might visit all below; the general bliss
3686,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Thrilled every bosom, and the family"
3687,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Of man, for once[120] partook one common joy."
3688,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3689,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Full of the joy, yet still awake"
3690,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"To wonder, on went Thalaba;"
3691,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"On every side the song of mirth,"
3692,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The music of festivity,"
3693,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Invite the passing youth.
3694,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Wearied at length with hunger and with heat
3695,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"He enters in a banquet room,"
3696,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Where round a fountain brink,"
3697,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,On silken[121] carpets sate the festive train.
3698,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Instant thro' all his frame
3699,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Delightful coolness spread;
3700,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The playing fount refreshed
3701,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The agitated air;
3702,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The very light came cooled thro' silvering panes
3703,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Of pearly[122] shell, like the pale moon-beam tinged;"
3704,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Or where the wine-vase[123] filled the aperture,"
3705,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Rosy as rising morn, or softer gleam"
3706,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Of saffron, like the sunny evening mist:"
3707,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Thro' every hue, and streaked by all"
3708,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The flowing fountain played.
3709,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Around the water-edge
3710,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Vessels of wine, alternate placed,"
3711,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Ruby and amber, tinged its little waves."
3712,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,From golden goblets there[124]
3713,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The guests sate quaffing the delicious juice
3714,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Of Shiraz' golden grape.
3715,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3716,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,But Thalaba took not the draught
3717,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,For rightly he knew had the Prophet forbidden
3718,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,That beverage the mother[125] of sins.
3719,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Nor did the urgent guests
3720,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Proffer a second time the liquid fire
3721,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,For in the youth's strong eye they saw
3722,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,No moveable resolve.
3723,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Yet not uncourteous, Thalaba"
3724,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Drank the cool draught of innocence,"
3725,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,That fragrant from its dewy[126] vase
3726,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Came purer than it left its native bed.
3727,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And he partook the odorous fruits,"
3728,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,For all rich fruits were there.
3729,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Water-melons rough of rind,"
3730,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Whose pulp the thirsty lip
3731,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Dissolved into a draught:
3732,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Pistachios from the heavy-clustered trees
3733,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Of Malavert, or Haleb's fertile soil,"
3734,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And Casbin's[127] luscious grapes of amber hue,"
3735,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,That many a week endure
3736,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The summer sun intense,"
3737,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Till by its powerful fire
3738,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"All watery particles exhaled, alone"
3739,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The strong essential sweetness ripens there.
3740,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Here cased in ice, the [128]apricot,"
3741,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"A topaz, crystal-set:"
3742,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Here on a plate of snow
3743,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"The sunny orange rests,"
3744,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And still the aloes and the sandal-wood
3745,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,From golden censers o'er the banquet room
3746,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Diffuse their dying sweets.
3747,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3748,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Anon a troop of females formed the dance
3749,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Their ancles bound with [129]bracelet-bells
3750,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,That made the modulating harmony.
3751,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Transparent[130] garments to the greedy eye
3752,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Gave all their harlot limbs,"
3753,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"That writhed, in each immodest gesture skilled."
3754,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3755,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,With earnest eyes the banqueters
3756,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Fed on the sight impure;
3757,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And Thalaba, he gazed,"
3758,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,But in his heart he bore a talisman
3759,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Whose blessed Alchemy
3760,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,To virtuous thoughts refined
3761,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The loose suggestions of the scene impure.
3762,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Oneiza's image swam before his sight,"
3763,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,His own Arabian Maid.
3764,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"He rose, and from the banquet room he rushed,"
3765,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And tears ran down his burning cheek,"
3766,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And nature for a moment woke the thought
3767,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And murmured, that from all domestic joys"
3768,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Estranged, he wandered o'er the world"
3769,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"A lonely being, far from all he loved."
3770,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Son of Hodeirah, not among thy crimes"
3771,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,That murmur shall be written!
3772,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,
3773,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"From tents of revelry,"
3774,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"From festal bowers, to solitude he ran,"
3775,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And now he reached where all the rills
3776,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Of that well-watered garden in one tide
3777,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Rolled their collected waves.
3778,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A straight and stately bridge
3779,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Stretched its long arches o'er the ample stream.
3780,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Strong in the evening and distinct its shade
3781,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Lay on the watry mirror, and his eye"
3782,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Saw it united with its parent pile
3783,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"One huge fantastic fabric. Drawing near,"
3784,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Loud from the chambers[131] of the bridge below,"
3785,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Sounds of carousal came and song,"
3786,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And unveiled women bade the advancing youth
3787,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Come merry-make with them.
3788,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Unhearing or unheeding, Thalaba"
3789,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Past o'er with hurried pace,"
3790,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,And plunged amid the forest solitude.
3791,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Deserts of Araby!
3792,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,His soul returned to you.
3793,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,He cast himself upon the earth
3794,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And closed his eyes, and called"
3795,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The voluntary vision up.
3796,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,A cry as of distress
3797,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Aroused him; loud it came, and near!"
3798,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"He started up, he strung his bow,"
3799,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,He plucked the arrow forth.
3800,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Again a shriek ... a woman's shriek!
3801,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"And lo! she rushes thro' the trees,"
3802,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"Her veil all rent, her garments torn!"
3803,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"He follows close, the ravisher...."
3804,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Even on the unechoing grass
3805,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"She hears his tread, so close!"
3806,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""Prophet save me! save me God!"
3807,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"""Help! help!"" she cried to Thalaba,"
3808,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,Thalaba drew the bow.
3809,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,The unerring arrow did its work of death.
3810,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"He turned him to the woman, and beheld"
3811,_THE SIXTH BOOK._,"His own Oneiza, his Arabian Maid."

3906,ONEIZA.,"""There is no way!"" he cried."

3922,ONEIZA.,
3923,ONEIZA.,"Silent and calm the river rolled along,"

3927,ONEIZA.,"Still full and silent, held its even way,"
3928,ONEIZA.,"But the deep sound, the dash"

3930,ONEIZA.,As if it forced its stream
3931,ONEIZA.,Struggling with crags along a narrow pass.
3932,ONEIZA.,And lo! where raving o'er a hollow course
3933,ONEIZA.,The ever-flowing tide
3934,ONEIZA.,Foams in a thousand whirlpools! there adown
3935,ONEIZA.,The perforated rock
3936,ONEIZA.,"Plunge the whole waters, so precipitous,"
3937,ONEIZA.,So fathomless a fall
3938,ONEIZA.,That their earth-shaking roar came deadened up
3939,ONEIZA.,Like subterranean thunders.
3940,ONEIZA.,"""Allah save us!"""
3941,ONEIZA.,"Oneiza cried, ""there is no path for man"

3971,ONEIZA.,"She shook her head, ""a Sorcerer he"
3972,ONEIZA.,"""And guarded by so many! Thalaba,..."
3973,ONEIZA.,"""And thou but one!"""
3974,ONEIZA.,"He raised his hand to Heaven,"
3975,ONEIZA.,"""Is there not God, Oneiza?"
3976,ONEIZA.,"""I have a Talisman, that, whoso bears,"
3977,ONEIZA.,"""Him, nor the Earthly, nor the Infernal Powers"
3978,ONEIZA.,"""Of Evil can cast down."
3979,ONEIZA.,"""Remember Destiny"
3980,ONEIZA.,"""Hath marked me from mankind!"
3981,ONEIZA.,"""Now rest in faith, and I will guard thy sleep!"""
3982,ONEIZA.,
3983,ONEIZA.,So on a violet bank
3984,ONEIZA.,"The Arabian Maid lay down,"
3985,ONEIZA.,Her soft cheek pillowed upon moss and flowers.
3986,ONEIZA.,"She lay in silent prayer,"
3987,ONEIZA.,"Till prayer had tranquillized her fears,"
3988,ONEIZA.,And sleep fell on her. By her side
3989,ONEIZA.,"Silent sate Thalaba,"
3990,ONEIZA.,"And gazed upon the Maid,"
3991,ONEIZA.,"And as he gazed, drew in"
3992,ONEIZA.,"New courage and intenser faith,"
3993,ONEIZA.,And waited calmly for the eventful day.
3994,ONEIZA.,
3995,ONEIZA.,"Loud sung the Lark, the awakened Maid"
3996,ONEIZA.,"Beheld him twinkling in the morning light,"
3997,ONEIZA.,And wished for wings and liberty like his.
3998,ONEIZA.,"The flush of fear inflamed her cheek,"
3999,ONEIZA.,"But Thalaba was calm of soul,"
4000,ONEIZA.,Collected for the work.
4001,ONEIZA.,He pondered in his mind
4002,ONEIZA.,How from Lobaba's breast
4003,ONEIZA.,His blunted arrow fell.
4004,ONEIZA.,Aloadin too might wear
4005,ONEIZA.,Spell perchance of equal power
4006,ONEIZA.,To blunt the weapon's edge!
4007,ONEIZA.,"Beside the river-brink,"
4008,ONEIZA.,"Rose a young poplar, whose unsteady leaves"
4009,ONEIZA.,"Varying their verdure to the gale,"
4010,ONEIZA.,With silver glitter caught
4011,ONEIZA.,His meditating eye.
4012,ONEIZA.,Then to Oneiza turned the youth
4013,ONEIZA.,"And gave his father's bow,"
4014,ONEIZA.,And o'er her shoulders slung
4015,ONEIZA.,The quiver arrow-stored.
4016,ONEIZA.,"""Me other weapon suits;"" said he,"
4017,ONEIZA.,"""Bear thou the Bow: dear Maid!"
4018,ONEIZA.,"""The days return upon me, when these shafts,"
4019,ONEIZA.,"""True to thy guidance, from the lofty palm"
4020,ONEIZA.,"""Brought down the cluster, and thy gladdened eye"
4021,ONEIZA.,"""Exulting turned to seek the voice of praise."
4022,ONEIZA.,"""Oh! yet again Oneiza, we shall share"
4023,ONEIZA.,"""Our desert joys!"""
4024,ONEIZA.,So saying to the bank
4025,ONEIZA.,"He moved, and stooping low,"
4026,ONEIZA.,"With double grasp, hand below hand, he clenched"
4027,ONEIZA.,And from its watry soil
4028,ONEIZA.,Uptore the poplar trunk.
4029,ONEIZA.,"Then off he shook the clotted earth,"
4030,ONEIZA.,And broke away the head
4031,ONEIZA.,"And boughs and lesser roots,"
4032,ONEIZA.,And lifting it aloft
4033,ONEIZA.,Wielded with able sway the massy club.
4034,ONEIZA.,"""Now for this child of Hell!"" quoth Thalaba,"
4035,ONEIZA.,"""Belike he shall exchange to day"
4036,ONEIZA.,"""His dainty Paradise"
4037,ONEIZA.,"""For other dwelling, and the fruit"
4038,ONEIZA.,"""Of Zaccoum,[134] cursed tree."""
4039,ONEIZA.,
4040,ONEIZA.,With that the youth and Arab maid
4041,ONEIZA.,Towards the garden centre past.
4042,ONEIZA.,It chanced that Aloadin had convoked
4043,ONEIZA.,"The garden-habitants,"
4044,ONEIZA.,And with the assembled throng
4045,ONEIZA.,"Oneiza mingled, and the appointed youth."
4046,ONEIZA.,"Unmarked they mingled, or if one"
4047,ONEIZA.,With busier finger to his neighbour notes
4048,ONEIZA.,"The quivered Maid, ""haply,"" he says,"
4049,ONEIZA.,"""Some daughter of the[135] Homerites,"
4050,ONEIZA.,"""Or one who yet remembers with delight"
4051,ONEIZA.,"""Her native tents of Himiar!"" ""Nay!"" rejoins"
4052,ONEIZA.,"His comrade, ""a love-pageant! for the man"
4053,ONEIZA.,"""Mimics with that fierce eye and knotty club"
4054,ONEIZA.,"""Some savage lion-tamer, she forsooth"
4055,ONEIZA.,"""Must play the heroine of the years of old!"""
4056,ONEIZA.,
4057,ONEIZA.,Radiant with gems upon his throne of gold
4058,ONEIZA.,Aloadin sate.
4059,ONEIZA.,O'er the Sorcerer's head
4060,ONEIZA.,"Hovered a Bird, and in the fragrant air"
4061,ONEIZA.,"Waved his winnowing wings,"
4062,ONEIZA.,A living canopy.
4063,ONEIZA.,Large as the plumeless Cassowar
4064,ONEIZA.,Was that o'ershadowing Bird;
4065,ONEIZA.,"So huge his talons, in their grasp"
4066,ONEIZA.,The Eagle would have hung a helpless prey.
4067,ONEIZA.,"His beak was iron, and his plumes"
4068,ONEIZA.,"Glittered like burnished gold,"
4069,ONEIZA.,"And his eyes glowed, as tho' an inward fire"
4070,ONEIZA.,Shone thro' a diamond orb.
4071,ONEIZA.,
4072,ONEIZA.,The blinded multitude
4073,ONEIZA.,"Adored the Sorcerer,"
4074,ONEIZA.,"And bent the knee before him,"
4075,ONEIZA.,"And shouted out his praise,"
4076,ONEIZA.,"""Mighty art thou, the Bestower of joy,"
4077,ONEIZA.,"""The Lord of Paradise!"""
4078,ONEIZA.,"Aloadin waved his hand,"
4079,ONEIZA.,In idolizing reverence
4080,ONEIZA.,Moveless they stood and mute.
4081,ONEIZA.,"""Children of Earth,"" he cried,"
4082,ONEIZA.,"""Whom I have guided here"
4083,ONEIZA.,"""By easier passage than the gate of Death,"
4084,ONEIZA.,"""The infidel Sultan to whose lands"
4085,ONEIZA.,"""My mountains reach their roots,"
4086,ONEIZA.,"""Blasphemes and threatens me."
4087,ONEIZA.,"""Strong are his armies, many are his guards,"
4088,ONEIZA.,"""Yet may a dagger find him."
4089,ONEIZA.,"""Children of Earth, I tempt you not"
4090,ONEIZA.,"""With the vain promise of a bliss unseen,"
4091,ONEIZA.,"""With tales of a hereafter Heaven"
4092,ONEIZA.,"""Whence never Traveller hath returned!"
4093,ONEIZA.,"""Have ye not tasted of the cup of joy,"
4094,ONEIZA.,"""That in these groves of happiness"
4095,ONEIZA.,"""For ever over-mantling tempts"
4096,ONEIZA.,"""The ever-thirsty lip?"
4097,ONEIZA.,"""Who is there here that by a deed"
4098,ONEIZA.,"""Of danger will deserve"
4099,ONEIZA.,"""The eternal joys of actual Paradise?"
4100,ONEIZA.,
4101,ONEIZA.,"""I!"" Thalaba exclaimed,"
4102,ONEIZA.,"And springing forward, on the Sorcerer's head"
4103,ONEIZA.,He dashed the knotty club.
4104,ONEIZA.,
4105,ONEIZA.,"He fell not, tho' the force"
4106,ONEIZA.,Shattered his skull; nor flowed the blood.
4107,ONEIZA.,For by some hellish talisman
4108,ONEIZA.,His life imprisoned still
4109,ONEIZA.,Dwelt in the body. The astonished crowd
4110,ONEIZA.,"Stand motionless with fear, and wait"
4111,ONEIZA.,Immediate vengeance from the wrath of Heaven.
4112,ONEIZA.,And lo! the Bird ... the monster Bird
4113,ONEIZA.,Soars up ... then pounces down
4114,ONEIZA.,To seize on Thalaba!
4115,ONEIZA.,"Now Oneiza, bend the bow,"
4116,ONEIZA.,Now draw the arrow home!
4117,ONEIZA.,"It fled, the arrow from Oneiza's hand,"
4118,ONEIZA.,"It pierced the monster Bird,"
4119,ONEIZA.,It broke the Talisman.
4120,ONEIZA.,"Then darkness covered all,..."
4121,ONEIZA.,"Earth shook, Heaven thundered, and amid the yells"
4122,ONEIZA.,"Of Spirits accursed, destroyed"
4123,ONEIZA.,The Paradise[136] of Sin.
4124,ONEIZA.,
4125,ONEIZA.,At last the earth was still;
4126,ONEIZA.,The yelling of the Demons ceased;
4127,ONEIZA.,Opening the wreck and ruin to their sight
4128,ONEIZA.,The darkness rolled away. Alone in life
4129,ONEIZA.,Amid the desolation and the dead
4130,ONEIZA.,Stood the Destroyer and the Arabian Maid.
4131,ONEIZA.,"They looked around, the rocks were rent,"
4132,ONEIZA.,"The path was open, late by magic closed."
4133,ONEIZA.,Awe-struck and silent down the stony glen
4134,ONEIZA.,They wound their thoughtful way.
4135,ONEIZA.,
4136,ONEIZA.,Amid the vale below
4137,ONEIZA.,"Tents rose, and streamers played"
4138,ONEIZA.,"And javelins sparkled in the sun,"
4139,ONEIZA.,And multitudes encamped
4140,ONEIZA.,"Swarmed, far as eye could follow, o'er the plain."
4141,ONEIZA.,There in his war pavilion sate
4142,ONEIZA.,In council with his Chiefs
4143,ONEIZA.,The Sultan of the Land.
4144,ONEIZA.,Before his presence there a Captain led
4145,ONEIZA.,Oneiza and the appointed Youth.
4146,ONEIZA.,
4147,ONEIZA.,"""Obedient to our Lord's command,"" said he,"
4148,ONEIZA.,"""We past towards the mountains, and began"
4149,ONEIZA.,"""The ascending strait; when suddenly Earth shook,"
4150,ONEIZA.,"""And darkness like the midnight fell around,"
4151,ONEIZA.,"""And fire and thunder came from Heaven"
4152,ONEIZA.,"""As tho' the Retribution day were come."
4153,ONEIZA.,"""After the terror ceased, and when with hearts"
4154,ONEIZA.,"""Somewhat assured, again we ventured on,"
4155,ONEIZA.,"""This youth and woman met us on the way."
4156,ONEIZA.,"""They told us that from Aloadin's haunt"
4157,ONEIZA.,"""They came on whom the judgement-stroke has fallen;"
4158,ONEIZA.,"""He and his sinful Paradise at once"
4159,ONEIZA.,"""Destroyed by them, the agents they of Heaven."
4160,ONEIZA.,"""Therefore I brought them hither, to repeat"
4161,ONEIZA.,"""The tale before thy presence; that as search"
4162,ONEIZA.,"""Shall prove it false or faithful, to their merit"
4163,ONEIZA.,"""Thou mayest reward them."""
4164,ONEIZA.,"""Be it done to us,"""
4165,ONEIZA.,"Thalaba answered, ""as the truth shall prove!"""
4166,ONEIZA.,
4167,ONEIZA.,The Sultan while he spake
4168,ONEIZA.,"""Fixed on him the proud eye of sovereignty;"
4169,ONEIZA.,"""If thou hast played with us,"
4170,ONEIZA.,"""By Allah and by Ali, Death shall seal"
4171,ONEIZA.,"""The lying lips for ever! if the thing"
4172,ONEIZA.,"""Be as thou sayest it, Arab, thou shalt stand"
4173,ONEIZA.,"""Next to ourself!""..."
4174,ONEIZA.,And hark! the cry
4175,ONEIZA.,"The lengthening cry, the increasing shout"
4176,ONEIZA.,Of joyful multitudes!
4177,ONEIZA.,
4178,ONEIZA.,Breathless and panting to the tent
4179,ONEIZA.,"The bearer of good tidings comes,"
4180,ONEIZA.,"""O Sultan, live for ever! be thy foes"
4181,ONEIZA.,"""Like Aloadin all!"
4182,ONEIZA.,"""The wrath of God hath smitten him."""
4183,ONEIZA.,
4184,ONEIZA.,Joy at the welcome tale
4185,ONEIZA.,Shone in the Sultan's cheek
4186,ONEIZA.,"""Array the Arab in the robe"
4187,ONEIZA.,"""Of honour,"" he exclaimed,"
4188,ONEIZA.,"""And place a chain of gold around his neck,"
4189,ONEIZA.,"""And bind around his brow the diadem,"
4190,ONEIZA.,"""And mount him on my steed of state,"
4191,ONEIZA.,"""And lead him thro' the camp,"
4192,ONEIZA.,"""And let the Heralds go before and cry"
4193,ONEIZA.,"""Thus shall the Sultan reward"
4194,ONEIZA.,"""The man[137] who serves him well!"""
4195,ONEIZA.,
4196,ONEIZA.,Then in the purple robe
4197,ONEIZA.,They vested Thalaba.
4198,ONEIZA.,"And hung around his neck the golden chain,"
4199,ONEIZA.,"And bound his forehead with the diadem,"
4200,ONEIZA.,And on the royal steed
4201,ONEIZA.,"They led him thro' the camp,"
4202,ONEIZA.,And Heralds went before and cried
4203,ONEIZA.,"""Thus shall the Sultan reward"
4204,ONEIZA.,"""The man who serves him well!"""
4205,ONEIZA.,
4206,ONEIZA.,When from the pomp of triumph
4207,ONEIZA.,And presence of the King
4208,ONEIZA.,"Thalaba sought the tent allotted him,"
4209,ONEIZA.,Thoughtful the Arabian Maid beheld
4210,ONEIZA.,"His animated eye,"
4211,ONEIZA.,His cheek inflamed with pride.
4212,ONEIZA.,"""Oneiza!"" cried the youth,"
4213,ONEIZA.,"""The King hath done according to his word,"
4214,ONEIZA.,"""And made me in the land"
4215,ONEIZA.,"""Next to himself be named!..."
4216,ONEIZA.,"""But why that serious melancholy smile?"
4217,ONEIZA.,"""Oneiza when I heard the voice that gave me"
4218,ONEIZA.,"""Honour, and wealth, and fame, the instant thought"
4219,ONEIZA.,"""Arose to fill my joy, that thou wouldest hear"
4220,ONEIZA.,"""The tidings, and be happy."""

4223,ONEIZA.,
4224,ONEIZA.,Thalaba
4225,ONEIZA.,Thou wouldest not have me mirthful! am I not

4227,ONEIZA.,
4228,THALABA.,THALABA.
4229,THALABA.,
4230,THALABA.,But with me.

4234,ONEIZA.,"My Father,..."
4235,ONEIZA.,
4236,THALABA.,THALABA.
4237,THALABA.,
4238,THALABA.,Nay be comforted! last night
4239,THALABA.,To what wert thou exposed! in what a peril
4240,THALABA.,"The morning found us! safety, honour, wealth"
4241,THALABA.,These now are ours. This instant who thou wert
4242,THALABA.,The Sultan asked. I told him from our childhood
4243,THALABA.,We had been plighted;... was I wrong Oneiza?
4244,THALABA.,And when he said with bounties he would heap
4245,THALABA.,"Our nuptials,... wilt thou blame me if I blest"
4246,THALABA.,"His will, that bade me fix the marriage day!"
4247,THALABA.,In tears Oneiza?...
4248,THALABA.,
4249,ONEIZA.,ONEIZA.
4250,ONEIZA.,
4251,ONEIZA.,Remember Destiny
4252,ONEIZA.,Hath marked thee from mankind!
4253,ONEIZA.,
4254,THALABA.,THALABA.
4255,THALABA.,
4256,THALABA.,Perhaps when Aloadin was destroyed
4257,THALABA.,"The mission ceased, else would wise Providence"
4258,THALABA.,With its rewards and blessings strew my path
4259,THALABA.,Thus for accomplished service?
4260,THALABA.,
4261,ONEIZA.,ONEIZA.
4262,ONEIZA.,
4263,ONEIZA.,Thalaba!
4264,ONEIZA.,
4265,THALABA.,THALABA.
4266,THALABA.,
4267,THALABA.,"Or if haply not, yet whither should I go?"
4268,THALABA.,Is it not prudent to abide in peace
4269,THALABA.,Till I am summoned?
4270,THALABA.,
4271,ONEIZA.,ONEIZA.
4272,ONEIZA.,
4273,ONEIZA.,Take me to the Deserts!
4274,ONEIZA.,
4275,THALABA.,THALABA.
4276,THALABA.,
4277,THALABA.,But Moath is not there; and wouldest thou dwell
4278,THALABA.,In a Stranger's tent? thy father then might seek
4279,THALABA.,In long and fruitless wandering for his child.
4280,THALABA.,
4281,ONEIZA.,ONEIZA.
4282,ONEIZA.,
4283,ONEIZA.,Take me then to Mecca!
4284,ONEIZA.,There let me dwell a servant of the Temple.
4285,ONEIZA.,"Bind thou thyself my veil,... to human eye"
4286,ONEIZA.,"It never shall be lifted. There, whilst thou"
4287,ONEIZA.,"Shalt go upon thine enterprize, my prayers,"
4288,ONEIZA.,"Dear Thalaba! shall rise to succour thee,"
4289,ONEIZA.,"And I shall live,... if not in happiness;"
4290,ONEIZA.,Surely in hope.

4292,THALABA.,THALABA.
4293,THALABA.,
4294,THALABA.,Oh think of better things!
4295,THALABA.,The will of Heaven is plain: by wonderous ways
4296,THALABA.,"It led us here, and soon the common voice"
4297,THALABA.,"Shall tell what we have done, and how we dwell"
4298,THALABA.,"Under the shadow of the Sultan's wing,"
4299,THALABA.,"So shall thy father hear the fame, and find us"
4300,THALABA.,What he hath wished us ever.... Still in tears!
4301,THALABA.,Still that unwilling eye! nay ... nay.... Oneiza....
4302,THALABA.,Has then another since I left the tent....

4307,ONEIZA.,
4308,ONEIZA.,"With song, with music, and with dance"

4310,ONEIZA.,Following on the veiled Bride
4311,ONEIZA.,Fifty female slaves attend
4312,ONEIZA.,In costly robes that gleam
4313,ONEIZA.,"With interwoven gold,"
4314,ONEIZA.,And sparkle far with gems.
4315,ONEIZA.,An hundred slaves behind them bear
4316,ONEIZA.,Vessels of silver and vessels of gold
4317,ONEIZA.,And many a gorgeous garment gay
4318,ONEIZA.,The presents that the Sultan gave.
4319,ONEIZA.,On either hand the pages go
4320,ONEIZA.,"With torches flaring thro' the gloom,"
4321,ONEIZA.,And trump and timbrel merriment
4322,ONEIZA.,Accompanies their way;
4323,ONEIZA.,And multitudes with loud acclaim
4324,ONEIZA.,Shout blessings on the Bride.
4325,ONEIZA.,"And now they reach the palace pile,"
4326,ONEIZA.,"The palace home of Thalaba,"
4327,ONEIZA.,And now the marriage feast is spread
4328,ONEIZA.,And from the finished banquet now
4329,ONEIZA.,The wedding guests are gone.

4431,OLD MAN.,The sound of his dear native tongue
4432,OLD MAN.,Awakened Thalaba.
4433,OLD MAN.,He raised his countenance
4434,OLD MAN.,"And saw the good Old Man,"
4435,OLD MAN.,"And he arose, and fell upon his neck,"
4436,OLD MAN.,And groaned in bitterness.
4437,OLD MAN.,"Then Moath knew the youth,"
4438,OLD MAN.,"And feared that he was childless, and he turned"
4439,OLD MAN.,"His eyes, and pointed to the tomb."
4440,OLD MAN.,"""Old Man!"" cried Thalaba,"
4441,OLD MAN.,"""Thy search is ended there!"""
4442,OLD MAN.,
4443,OLD MAN.,The father's cheek grew white
4444,OLD MAN.,And his lip quivered with the misery;
4445,OLD MAN.,"Howbeit, collecting with a painful voice"
4446,OLD MAN.,"He answered, ""God is good! his will be done!"""
4447,OLD MAN.,
4448,OLD MAN.,"The woe in which he spake,"
4449,OLD MAN.,"The resignation that inspired his speech,"
4450,OLD MAN.,They softened Thalaba.
4451,OLD MAN.,"""Thou hast a solace in thy grief,"" he cried,"
4452,OLD MAN.,"""A comforter within!"
4453,OLD MAN.,"""Moath! thou seest me here,"
4454,OLD MAN.,"""Delivered to the Evil Powers,"
4455,OLD MAN.,"""A God-abandoned wretch."""
4456,OLD MAN.,
4457,OLD MAN.,The Old Man looked at him incredulous.
4458,OLD MAN.,"""Nightly,"" the youth pursued,"
4459,OLD MAN.,"""Thy daughter comes to drive me to despair."
4460,OLD MAN.,"""Moath thou thinkest me mad,..."
4461,OLD MAN.,"""But when the Cryer[138] from the Minaret"
4462,OLD MAN.,"""Proclaims the midnight hour,"
4463,OLD MAN.,"""Hast thou a heart to see her?"""
4464,OLD MAN.,
4465,OLD MAN.,In the[139] Meidan now
4466,OLD MAN.,The clang of clarions and of drums
4467,OLD MAN.,Accompanied the Sun's descent.
4468,OLD MAN.,"""Dost thou not pray? my son!"""
4469,OLD MAN.,"Said Moath, as he saw"
4470,OLD MAN.,The white flag waving on the neighbouring Mosque;
4471,OLD MAN.,"Then Thalaba's eye grew wild,"
4472,OLD MAN.,"""Pray!"" echoed he, ""I must not pray!"""
4473,OLD MAN.,And the hollow groan he gave
4474,OLD MAN.,"Went to the Old Man's heart,"
4475,OLD MAN.,"And bowing down his face to earth,"
4476,OLD MAN.,In fervent agony he called on God.
4477,OLD MAN.,
4478,OLD MAN.,A night of darkness and of storms!
4479,OLD MAN.,Into the Chamber[140] of the Tomb
4480,OLD MAN.,"Thalaba led the Old Man,"
4481,OLD MAN.,To roof him from the rain.
4482,OLD MAN.,A night of storms! the wind
4483,OLD MAN.,Swept thro' the moonless sky
4484,OLD MAN.,And moaned among the pillared sepulchres.
4485,OLD MAN.,And in the pauses of its sweep
4486,OLD MAN.,They heard the heavy rain
4487,OLD MAN.,Beat on the monument above.
4488,OLD MAN.,In silence on Oneiza's grave
4489,OLD MAN.,The Father and the Husband sate.
4490,OLD MAN.,
4491,OLD MAN.,The Cryer from the Minaret
4492,OLD MAN.,Proclaimed the midnight hour;
4493,OLD MAN.,"""Now! now!"" cried Thalaba,"
4494,OLD MAN.,And o'er the chamber of the tomb
4495,OLD MAN.,There spread a lurid gleam
4496,OLD MAN.,"Like the reflection of a sulphur fire,"
4497,OLD MAN.,And in that hideous light
4498,OLD MAN.,"Oneiza stood before them, it was She,"
4499,OLD MAN.,"Her very lineaments, and such as death"
4500,OLD MAN.,"Had changed them, livid cheeks, and lips of blue."
4501,OLD MAN.,But in her eyes there dwelt
4502,OLD MAN.,Brightness more terrible
4503,OLD MAN.,Than all the loathsomeness of death.
4504,OLD MAN.,"""Still art thou living, wretch?"""
4505,OLD MAN.,"In hollow tones she cried to Thalaba,"
4506,OLD MAN.,"""And must I nightly leave my grave"
4507,OLD MAN.,"""To tell thee, still in vain,"
4508,OLD MAN.,"""God has abandoned thee?"""
4509,OLD MAN.,
4510,OLD MAN.,"""This is not she!"" the Old Man exclaimed,"
4511,OLD MAN.,"""A Fiend! a manifest Fiend!"""
4512,OLD MAN.,"And to the youth he held his lance,"
4513,OLD MAN.,"""Strike and deliver thyself!"""
4514,OLD MAN.,"""Strike HER!"" cried Thalaba,"
4515,OLD MAN.,And palsied of all powers
4516,OLD MAN.,Gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.
4517,OLD MAN.,"""Yea! strike her!"" cried a voice whose tones"
4518,OLD MAN.,"Flowed with such sudden healing thro' his soul,"
4519,OLD MAN.,As when the desert shower
4520,OLD MAN.,From death delivered him.
4521,OLD MAN.,But unobedient to that well-known voice
4522,OLD MAN.,"His eye was seeking it,"
4523,OLD MAN.,"When Moath firm of heart,"
4524,OLD MAN.,Performed the bidding; thro' the vampire[141] corpse
4525,OLD MAN.,"He thrust his lance; it fell,"
4526,OLD MAN.,And howling with the wound
4527,OLD MAN.,Its demon tenant fled.
4528,OLD MAN.,"A sapphire light fell on them,"
4529,OLD MAN.,"And garmented with glory, in their sight"
4530,OLD MAN.,Oneiza's Spirit stood.
4531,OLD MAN.,
4532,OLD MAN.,"""O Thalaba!"" she cried,"
4533,OLD MAN.,"""Abandon not thyself!"
4534,OLD MAN.,"""Wouldst thou for ever lose me?... go, fulfill"
4535,OLD MAN.,"""Thy quest, that in the Bowers of Paradise"
4536,OLD MAN.,"""In vain I may not wait thee, O my Husband!"""
4537,OLD MAN.,To Moath then the Spirit
4538,OLD MAN.,"Turned the dark lustre of her Angel eyes,"
4539,OLD MAN.,"""Short is thy destined path,"
4540,OLD MAN.,"""O my dear father! to the abode of bliss."
4541,OLD MAN.,"""Return to Araby,"
4542,OLD MAN.,"""There with the thought of death."
4543,OLD MAN.,"""Comfort thy lonely age,"
4544,OLD MAN.,"""And Azrael the Deliverer, soon"
4545,OLD MAN.,"""Shall visit thee in peace."""
4546,OLD MAN.,
4547,OLD MAN.,They stood with earnest eyes
4548,OLD MAN.,"And arms out-reaching, when again"
4549,OLD MAN.,The darkness closed around them.
4550,OLD MAN.,The soul of Thalaba revived;
4551,OLD MAN.,He from the floor the quiver took
4552,OLD MAN.,"And as he bent the bow, exclaimed,"
4553,OLD MAN.,"""Was it the over-ruling Providence"
4554,OLD MAN.,"""That in the hour of frenzy led my hands"
4555,OLD MAN.,"""Instinctively to this?"
4556,OLD MAN.,"""To-morrow, and the sun shall brace anew"
4557,OLD MAN.,"""The slackened cord that now sounds loose and damp,"
4558,OLD MAN.,"""To-morrow, and its livelier tone will sing"
4559,OLD MAN.,"""In tort vibration to the arrow's flight."
4560,OLD MAN.,"""I ... but I also, with recovered health"
4561,OLD MAN.,"""Of heart, shall do my duty."
4562,OLD MAN.,"""My Father! here I leave thee then!"" he cried,"
4563,OLD MAN.,"""And not to meet again"
4564,OLD MAN.,"""Till at the gate of Paradise"
4565,OLD MAN.,"""The eternal union of our joys commence."
4566,OLD MAN.,"""We parted last in darkness!""... and the youth"
4567,OLD MAN.,"Thought with what other hopes,"
4568,OLD MAN.,"But now his heart was calm,"
4569,OLD MAN.,For on his soul a heavenly hope had dawned.
4570,OLD MAN.,"The Old Man answered nothing, but he held"
4571,OLD MAN.,His garment and to the door
4572,OLD MAN.,Of the Tomb Chamber followed him.
4573,OLD MAN.,"The rain had ceased, the sky was wild"
4574,OLD MAN.,Its black clouds broken by the storm.
4575,OLD MAN.,And lo! it chanced that in the chasm
4576,OLD MAN.,"Of Heaven between, a star,"
4577,OLD MAN.,"Leaving along its path continuous light,"
4578,OLD MAN.,"Shot eastward. ""See my guide!"" quoth Thalaba,"
4579,OLD MAN.,"And turning, he received"
4580,OLD MAN.,"Old Moath's last embrace,"
4581,OLD MAN.,And his last blessing.
4582,OLD MAN.,"It was eve,"
4583,OLD MAN.,"When an old Dervise, sitting in the sun"
4584,OLD MAN.,"At his cell door, invited for the night"
4585,OLD MAN.,The traveller; in the sun
4586,OLD MAN.,He spread the plain repast
4587,OLD MAN.,"Rice and fresh grapes, and at their feet there flowed"
4588,OLD MAN.,The brook of which they drank.
4589,OLD MAN.,
4590,OLD MAN.,"So as they sate at meal,"
4591,OLD MAN.,"With song, with music, and with dance,"
4592,OLD MAN.,A wedding train went by;
4593,OLD MAN.,"The veiled bride, the female slaves,"
4594,OLD MAN.,"The torches of festivity,"
4595,OLD MAN.,And trump and timbrel merriment
4596,OLD MAN.,Accompanied their way.
4597,OLD MAN.,The good old Dervise gave
4598,OLD MAN.,A blessing as they past.
4599,OLD MAN.,"But Thalaba looked on,"
4600,OLD MAN.,"And breathed a low, deep groan, and hid his face."
4601,OLD MAN.,The Dervise had known sorrow; and he felt
4602,OLD MAN.,Compassion; and his words
4603,OLD MAN.,Of pity and of piety
4604,OLD MAN.,Opened the young man's heart
4605,OLD MAN.,And he told all his tale.
4606,OLD MAN.,
4607,OLD MAN.,"""Repine not, O my Son!"" the Old Man replied,"
4608,OLD MAN.,"""That Heaven has chastened thee."
4609,OLD MAN.,"""Behold this vine,[142] I found it a wild tree"
4610,OLD MAN.,"""Whose wanton strength had swoln into"
4611,OLD MAN.,"""Irregular twigs, and bold excrescencies,"
4612,OLD MAN.,"""And spent itself in leaves and little rings,"
4613,OLD MAN.,"""In the vain flourish of its outwardness"
4614,OLD MAN.,"""Wasting the sap and strength"
4615,OLD MAN.,"""That should have given forth fruit."
4616,OLD MAN.,"""But when I pruned the Tree,"
4617,OLD MAN.,"""Then it grew temperate in its vain expence"
4618,OLD MAN.,"""Of useless leaves, and knotted, as thou seest,"
4619,OLD MAN.,"""Into these full, clear, clusters, to repay"
4620,OLD MAN.,"""The hand whose foresight wounded it."
4621,OLD MAN.,"""Repine not, O my Son!"
4622,OLD MAN.,"""In wisdom and in mercy Heaven inflicts,"
4623,OLD MAN.,"""Like a wise Leech, its painful remedies."""
4624,OLD MAN.,
4625,OLD MAN.,"Then pausing, ""whither goest thou now?"" he asked."
4626,OLD MAN.,"""I know not,"" answered Thalaba,"
4627,OLD MAN.,"""Straight on, with Destiny my guide."""
4628,OLD MAN.,"Quoth the Old Man, ""I will not blame thy trust,"
4629,OLD MAN.,"""And yet methinks thy feet"
4630,OLD MAN.,"""Should tread with certainty."
4631,OLD MAN.,"""In Kaf the Simorg hath his dwelling place,"
4632,OLD MAN.,"""The all-knowing Bird of Ages, who hath seen"
4633,OLD MAN.,"""The World, with all her children, thrice destroyed."
4634,OLD MAN.,"""Long is the thither path,"
4635,OLD MAN.,"""And difficult the way, of danger full;"
4636,OLD MAN.,"""But his unerring voice"
4637,OLD MAN.,"""Could point to certain end thy weary search."""
4638,OLD MAN.,
4639,OLD MAN.,Easy assent the youth
4640,OLD MAN.,Gave to the words of wisdom; and behold
4641,OLD MAN.,"At dawn, the adventurer on his way to Kaf."
4642,OLD MAN.,And he has travelled many a day
4643,OLD MAN.,"And many a river swum over,"
4644,OLD MAN.,And many a mountain ridge has crost
4645,OLD MAN.,"And many a measureless plain,"
4646,OLD MAN.,"And now amid the wilds advanced,"
4647,OLD MAN.,Long is it since his eyes
4648,OLD MAN.,Have seen the trace of man.
4649,OLD MAN.,
4650,OLD MAN.,Cold! cold! 'tis a chilly clime
4651,OLD MAN.,"That the toil of the youth has reached,"
4652,OLD MAN.,"And he is aweary now,"
4653,OLD MAN.,And faint for the lack of food.
4654,OLD MAN.,Cold! cold! there is no Sun in heaven
4655,OLD MAN.,But a heavy and uniform cloud
4656,OLD MAN.,And the snows begin to fall.
4657,OLD MAN.,"Dost thou wish for thy deserts, O Son of Hodeirah?"
4658,OLD MAN.,Dost thou long for the gales of Arabia?
4659,OLD MAN.,"Cold! cold! his blood flows languid,"
4660,OLD MAN.,"His hands are red, his lips are blue,"
4661,OLD MAN.,His feet are sore with the frost.
4662,OLD MAN.,Cheer thee! cheer thee! Thalaba!
4663,OLD MAN.,A little yet bear up!
4664,OLD MAN.,
4665,OLD MAN.,All waste! no sign of life
4666,OLD MAN.,But the track of the wolf and the bear!
4667,OLD MAN.,"No sound but the wild, wild wind"
4668,OLD MAN.,And the snow crunching under his feet!
4669,OLD MAN.,"Night is come; no moon, no stars,"
4670,OLD MAN.,Only the light of the snow!
4671,OLD MAN.,But behold a fire in the cave of the hill
4672,OLD MAN.,A heart-reviving fire;
4673,OLD MAN.,And thither with strength renewed
4674,OLD MAN.,Thalaba presses on.
4675,OLD MAN.,
4676,OLD MAN.,"He found a Woman in the cave,"
4677,OLD MAN.,"A solitary Woman,"
4678,OLD MAN.,Who by the fire was spinning
4679,OLD MAN.,And singing as she spun.
4680,OLD MAN.,The pine boughs they blazed chearfully
4681,OLD MAN.,And her face was bright with the flame.
4682,OLD MAN.,Her face was as a Damsel's face
4683,OLD MAN.,And yet her hair was grey.
4684,OLD MAN.,She bade him welcome with a smile
4685,OLD MAN.,And still continued spinning
4686,OLD MAN.,And singing as she spun.
4687,OLD MAN.,The thread the Woman drew
4688,OLD MAN.,"Was finer than the silkworm's,"
4689,OLD MAN.,Was finer than the gossamer.
4690,OLD MAN.,The song she sung was low and sweet
4691,OLD MAN.,And Thalaba knew not the words.
4692,OLD MAN.,
4693,OLD MAN.,"He laid his bow before the hearth,"
4694,OLD MAN.,For the string was frozen stiff.
4695,OLD MAN.,"He took the quiver from his neck,"
4696,OLD MAN.,For the arrow plumes were iced.
4697,OLD MAN.,Then as the chearful fire
4698,OLD MAN.,"Revived his languid limbs,"
4699,OLD MAN.,The adventurer asked for food.
4700,OLD MAN.,"The Woman answered him,"
4701,OLD MAN.,"And still her speech was song,"
4702,OLD MAN.,"""The She Bear she dwells near to me,"
4703,OLD MAN.,"""And she hath cubs, one, two and three."
4704,OLD MAN.,"""She hunts the deer and brings him here,"
4705,OLD MAN.,"""And then with her I make good cheer,"
4706,OLD MAN.,"""And she to the chase is gone"
4707,OLD MAN.,"""And she will be here anon."""
4708,OLD MAN.,
4709,OLD MAN.,"She ceased from her work as she spake,"
4710,OLD MAN.,"And when she had answered him,"
4711,OLD MAN.,Again her fingers twirled the thread
4712,OLD MAN.,And again the Woman began
4713,OLD MAN.,"In low, sweet, tones to sing"
4714,OLD MAN.,The unintelligible song.
4715,OLD MAN.,
4716,OLD MAN.,The thread she spun it gleamed like gold
4717,OLD MAN.,"In the light of the odorous fire,"
4718,OLD MAN.,"And yet so wonderous thin,"
4719,OLD MAN.,That save when the light shone on it
4720,OLD MAN.,It could not be seen by the eye.
4721,OLD MAN.,"The youth sate watching it,"
4722,OLD MAN.,And she beheld his wonder.
4723,OLD MAN.,And then again she spake to him
4724,OLD MAN.,"And still her speech was song,"
4725,OLD MAN.,"""Now twine it round thy hands I say,"
4726,OLD MAN.,"""Now twine it round thy hands I pray,"
4727,OLD MAN.,"""My thread is small, my thread is fine,"
4728,OLD MAN.,"""But he must be"
4729,OLD MAN.,"""A stronger than thee,"
4730,OLD MAN.,"""Who can break this thread of mine!"""
4731,OLD MAN.,
4732,OLD MAN.,And up she raised her bright blue eyes
4733,OLD MAN.,"And sweetly she smiled on him,"
4734,OLD MAN.,And he conceived no ill.
4735,OLD MAN.,"And round and round his right hand,"
4736,OLD MAN.,"And round and round his left,"
4737,OLD MAN.,He wound the thread so fine.
4738,OLD MAN.,"And then again the Woman spake,"
4739,OLD MAN.,"And still her speech was song,"
4740,OLD MAN.,"""Now thy strength, O Stranger, strain,"
4741,OLD MAN.,"""Now then break the slender chain."""
4742,OLD MAN.,
4743,OLD MAN.,"Thalaba strove, but the thread"
4744,OLD MAN.,"Was woven by magic hands,"
4745,OLD MAN.,And in his cheek the flush of shame
4746,OLD MAN.,"Arose, commixt with fear."
4747,OLD MAN.,"She beheld and laughed at him,"
4748,OLD MAN.,"And then again she sung,"
4749,OLD MAN.,"""My thread is small, my thread is fine,"
4750,OLD MAN.,"""But he must be"
4751,OLD MAN.,"""A stronger than thee"
4752,OLD MAN.,"""Who can break this thread of mine."""
4753,OLD MAN.,
4754,OLD MAN.,And up she raised her bright blue eyes
4755,OLD MAN.,"And fiercely she smiled on him,"
4756,OLD MAN.,"""I thank thee, I thank thee, Hodeirah's Son!"
4757,OLD MAN.,"""I thank thee for doing what can't be undone,"
4758,OLD MAN.,"""For binding thyself in the chain I have spun!"""
4759,OLD MAN.,Then from his head she wrenched
4760,OLD MAN.,"A lock of his raven hair,"
4761,OLD MAN.,And cast it in the fire
4762,OLD MAN.,"And cried aloud as it burnt,"
4763,OLD MAN.,"""Sister! Sister! hear my voice!"
4764,OLD MAN.,"""Sister! Sister! come and rejoice,"
4765,OLD MAN.,"""The web is spun,"
4766,OLD MAN.,"""The prize is won,"
4767,OLD MAN.,"""The work is done,"
4768,OLD MAN.,"""For I have made captive Hoderiah's Son."""
4769,OLD MAN.,
4770,OLD MAN.,Borne in her magic car
4771,OLD MAN.,"The Sister Sorceress came,"
4772,OLD MAN.,"Khawla, the fiercest of the Sorcerer brood."
4773,OLD MAN.,"She gazed upon the youth,"
4774,OLD MAN.,"She bade him break the slender thread,"
4775,OLD MAN.,"She laughed aloud for scorn,"
4776,OLD MAN.,She clapt her hands for joy.
4777,OLD MAN.,
4778,OLD MAN.,"The She Bear from the chase came in,"
4779,OLD MAN.,"She bore the prey in her bloody mouth,"
4780,OLD MAN.,"She laid it at Maimuna's feet,"
4781,OLD MAN.,And she looked up with wistful eyes
4782,OLD MAN.,As if to ask her share.
4783,OLD MAN.,"""There! there!"" quoth Maimuna"
4784,OLD MAN.,And pointing to the prisoner youth
4785,OLD MAN.,"She spurned him with her foot,"
4786,OLD MAN.,And bade her make her meal.
4787,OLD MAN.,But soon their mockery failed them
4788,OLD MAN.,"And anger and shame arose,"
4789,OLD MAN.,For the She Bear fawned on Thalaba
4790,OLD MAN.,And quietly licked his hand.
4791,OLD MAN.,
4792,OLD MAN.,The grey haired Sorceress stamped the ground
4793,OLD MAN.,"And called a Spirit up,"
4794,OLD MAN.,"""Shall we bear the Enemy"
4795,OLD MAN.,"""To the dungeon dens below?"""
4796,OLD MAN.,
4797,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
4798,SPIRIT.,
4799,SPIRIT.,Woe! woe! to our Empire woe!
4800,SPIRIT.,If ever he tread the caverns below.
4801,SPIRIT.,
4802,MAIMUNA.,MAIMUNA.
4803,MAIMUNA.,
4804,MAIMUNA.,Shall we leave him fettered here
4805,MAIMUNA.,With hunger and cold to die?
4806,MAIMUNA.,
4807,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
4808,SPIRIT.,
4809,SPIRIT.,Away from thy lonely dwelling fly!
4810,SPIRIT.,Here I see a danger nigh
4811,SPIRIT.,That he should live and thou shouldst die.
4812,SPIRIT.,
4813,MAIMUNA.,MAIMUNA.
4814,MAIMUNA.,
4815,MAIMUNA.,Whither must we bear the foe?
4816,MAIMUNA.,
4817,SPIRIT.,SPIRIT.
4818,SPIRIT.,
4819,SPIRIT.,"To Mohareb's island go,"
4820,SPIRIT.,"There shalt thou secure the foe,"
4821,SPIRIT.,There prevent thy future woe.
4822,SPIRIT.,
4823,SPIRIT.,Then in the Car they threw
4824,SPIRIT.,"The fettered Thalaba,"
4825,SPIRIT.,"And took their seats, and set"
4826,SPIRIT.,"Their feet upon his neck,"
4827,SPIRIT.,Maimuna held the reins
4828,SPIRIT.,And Khawla shook the scourge
4829,SPIRIT.,And away![143] away! away!
4830,SPIRIT.,They were no steeds of mortal race
4831,SPIRIT.,That drew the magic car
4832,SPIRIT.,With the swiftness of feet and of wings.
4833,SPIRIT.,"The snow-dust rises behind them,"
4834,SPIRIT.,"The ice-rocks splinters fly,"
4835,SPIRIT.,And hark! in the valley below
4836,SPIRIT.,The sound of their chariot wheels
4837,SPIRIT.,And they are far over the mountains.
4838,SPIRIT.,Away! away! away!
4839,SPIRIT.,The Demons of the air
4840,SPIRIT.,"Shout their joy as the Sisters pass,"
4841,SPIRIT.,The Ghosts of the Wicked that wander by night
4842,SPIRIT.,Flit over the magic car.
4843,SPIRIT.,Away! away! away!
4844,SPIRIT.,Over the hills and the plains
4845,SPIRIT.,"Over the rivers and rocks,"
4846,SPIRIT.,Over the sands of the shore;
4847,SPIRIT.,The waves of ocean heave
4848,SPIRIT.,"Under the magic steeds,"
4849,SPIRIT.,With unwet hoofs they trample the deep
4850,SPIRIT.,"And now they reach the Island coast,"
4851,SPIRIT.,And away to the city the Monarch's abode.
4852,SPIRIT.,"Open fly the city gates,"
4853,SPIRIT.,Open fly the iron doors
4854,SPIRIT.,The doors of the palace court.
4855,SPIRIT.,Then stopt the charmed car.
4856,SPIRIT.,The Monarch heard the chariot wheels
4857,SPIRIT.,And forth he came to greet
4858,SPIRIT.,The Mistress whom he served.
4859,SPIRIT.,"He knew the captive youth,"
4860,SPIRIT.,And Thalaba beheld

4879,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Go up, and read the stars!"""
4880,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
4881,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Lo! on the terrace of the topmost tower
4882,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She stands; her darkening eyes,"
4883,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her fine face raised to heaven,"
4884,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Her white hair flowing like the silver streams
4885,_THE NINTH BOOK._,That streak the northern night.
4886,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
4887,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"They hear her coming tread,"
4888,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"They lift their asking eyes,"
4889,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her face is serious, her unwilling lips"
4890,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Slow to the tale of ill.
4891,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""What hast thou read? what hast thou read?"""
4892,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Quoth Khawla in alarm.
4893,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Danger ... death ... judgement!"" Maimuna replied."
4894,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
4895,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Is that the language of the lights of Heaven?"""
4896,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Exclaimed the sterner Witch.
4897,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Creatures of Allah, they perform his will."
4898,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""And with their lying menaces would daunt"
4899,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Our credulous folly.... Maimuna,"
4900,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""I never liked this uncongenial lore!"
4901,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Better befits to make the sacrifice"
4902,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Of Divination; so shall I"
4903,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Be mine own Oracle."
4904,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Command the victims thou, O King!"
4905,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Male and female they must be,"
4906,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Thou knowest the needful rites."
4907,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Meanwhile I purify the place."""
4908,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
4909,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The Sultan went; the Sorceress rose,"
4910,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And North and South and East and West
4911,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She faced the points of Heaven,"
4912,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And ever where she turned
4913,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She laid her hand upon the wall,"
4914,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And up she looked and smote the air,"
4915,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And down she stooped and smote the floor,"
4916,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""To Eblis and his servants"
4917,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""I consecrate the place,"

4922,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
4923,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Now all is prepared;
4924,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Mohareb returns,"
4925,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The Circle is drawn,"
4926,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The Victims have bled,"
4927,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Youth and the Maid.
4928,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She in the circle holds in either hand
4929,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Clenched by the hair, a head,"
4930,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The heads of the Youth and the Maid.
4931,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Go out ye lights!"" quoth Khawla,"
4932,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And in darkness began the spell.
4933,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
4934,_THE NINTH BOOK._,With spreading arms she whirls around
4935,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Rapidly, rapidly"
4936,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Ever around and around;
4937,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And loudly she calls the while
4938,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Eblis! Eblis!"""
4939,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Loudly, incessantly,"
4940,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Still she calls ""Eblis! Eblis!"""
4941,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Giddily, giddily, still she whirls,"
4942,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Loudly, incessantly, still she calls;"
4943,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The motion is ever the same,"
4944,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Ever around and around;
4945,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The calling is still the same
4946,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Still it is ""Eblis! Eblis!"""
4947,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And her voice is a shapeless yell,"
4948,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And dizzily rolls her brain,"
4949,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And now she is full of the Fiend.
4950,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She stops, she rocks, she reels!"
4951,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Look! look! she appears in the darkness!
4952,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Her flamy hairs curl up
4953,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"All living, like the Meteor's locks of light!"
4954,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Her eyes are like the sickly Moon!
4955,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
4956,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"It is her lips that move,"
4957,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her tongue that shapes the sound,"
4958,_THE NINTH BOOK._,But whose is the Voice that proceeds?
4959,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Ye may hope and ye may fear,"
4960,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""The danger of his stars is near."
4961,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Sultan! if he perish, woe!"

4966,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
4967,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She spake the Oracle,"
4968,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And senselessly she fell.
4969,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"They knelt in care beside her,"
4970,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Her Sister and the King.
4971,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"They sprinkled her palms with water,"
4972,_THE NINTH BOOK._,They wetted her nostrils with blood.
4973,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She wakes as from a dream,"
4974,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She asks the uttered Voice,"
4975,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"But when she heard, an anger and a grief"
4976,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Darkened her wrinkling brow.
4977,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Then let him live in long captivity!"""
4978,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She answered: but Mohareb's quickened eye
4979,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Perused her sullen countenance
4980,_THE NINTH BOOK._,That lied not with the lips.
4981,_THE NINTH BOOK._,A miserable man!
4982,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"What boots it, that, in central caves"
4983,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Powers of Evil at his Baptism pledged
4984,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Sacrament of Hell?
4985,_THE NINTH BOOK._,His death secures them now.
4986,_THE NINTH BOOK._,What boots it that they gave
4987,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Abdaldar's guardian ring,"
4988,_THE NINTH BOOK._,When thro' another's life
4989,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The blow may reach his own?
4990,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
4991,_THE NINTH BOOK._,He sought the dungeon cell
4992,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Where Thalaba was laid.
4993,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"'Twas the grey morning twilight, and the voice"
4994,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Of Thalaba in prayer,"
4995,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"With words of hallowed import, smote"
4996,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The King's alarmed sense.
4997,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The grating of the heavy hinge
4998,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Roused not the Arabian youth;
4999,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Nor lifted he his earthward face
5000,_THE NINTH BOOK._,At sound of coming feet.
5001,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Nor did Mohareb with unholy voice
5002,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Disturb the duty: silent, spirit-awed,"
5003,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Envious, heart-humbled, he beheld"
5004,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The dungeon-peace of piety
5005,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Till Thalaba, the perfect rite performed,"
5006,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Raised his calm eye; then spake the Island-Chief.
5007,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Arab! my guidance thro' the dangerous Cave,"
5008,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Thy service overpaid,"
5009,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""An unintended friend in enmity."
5010,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""The hand that caught thy ring"
5011,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Received and bore me to the scene I sought."
5012,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Now know me grateful. I return"
5013,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""That amulet, thy only safety here."""
5014,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5015,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Artful he spake, with show of gratitude"
5016,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Veiling the selfish deed.
5017,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Locked in the magic chain
5018,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The powerless hand of Thalaba
5019,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Received again the Spell.
5020,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Remembering then with what an ominous faith
5021,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"First he drew on the gem,"
5022,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Youth repeats his words of augury;
5023,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""In God's name and the Prophet's! be its power"
5024,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Good, let it serve the holy! if for evil"
5025,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""God and my faith shall hallow it."
5026,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Blindly the wicked work"
5027,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""The righteous will of Heaven!"""
5028,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5029,_THE NINTH BOOK._,So Thalaba received again
5030,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The written ring of gold.
5031,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5032,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Thoughtful awhile Mohareb stood
5033,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And eyed the captive youth.
5034,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Then, building skilfully the sophist speech,"
5035,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Thus he began. ""Brave art thou, Thalaba!"
5036,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""And wherefore are we foes!... for I would buy"
5037,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Thy friendship at a princely price, and make thee"
5038,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""To thine own welfare wise."

5092,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Looked for his answer, then spake Thalaba."

5123,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Short respite from the avenging power within.
5124,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5125,_THE NINTH BOOK._,What Woman is she
5126,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"So wrinkled and old,"
5127,_THE NINTH BOOK._,That goes to the wood?
5128,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She leans on her staff
5129,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"With a tottering step,"
5130,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She tells her bead-strings slow
5131,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Thro' fingers dulled by age.
5132,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The wanton boys bemock her.
5133,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The babe in arms that meets her
5134,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Turns round with quick affright
5135,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And clings to his nurse's neck.
5136,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5137,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Hark! hark! the hunter's cry
5138,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Mohareb gone to the chase!
5139,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The dogs with eager yell
5140,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Are struggling to be free;
5141,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The hawks in frequent stoop
5142,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Token their haste for flight;
5143,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And couchant on the saddle-bow,"
5144,_THE NINTH BOOK._,With tranquil eyes and talons sheathed
5145,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The ounce expects his liberty.
5146,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5147,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Propt on the staff that shakes
5148,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Beneath her trembling weight,"
5149,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Old Woman sees them pass.
5150,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Halloa! halloa!
5151,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The game is up!
5152,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The dogs are loosed
5153,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The deer bounds over the plain,"
5154,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The lagging dogs behind
5155,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Follow from afar!
5156,_THE NINTH BOOK._,But lo! the Falcon o'er his head.
5157,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Hovers with hostile[146] wings,"
5158,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And buffets him with blinding strokes!
5159,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Dizzy with the deafening strokes
5160,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"In blind and interrupted course,"
5161,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Poor beast be struggles on;
5162,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And now the dogs are nigh!
5163,_THE NINTH BOOK._,How his heart pants! you see
5164,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The panting of his heart;
5165,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And tears like human tears
5166,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Roll down, along the big veins, fever-swoln;"
5167,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And now the death-sweat[147] darkens his dun hide!
5168,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"His fear, his groans, his agony, his death,"
5169,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Are the sport and the joy and the triumph!
5170,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5171,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Halloa! another prey,"
5172,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The nimble Antelope!
5173,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Ounce[148] is freed; one spring
5174,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And his talons are sheathed in her shoulders,"
5175,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And his teeth are red in her gore.
5176,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"There came a sound from the wood,"
5177,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Like the howl of the winter wind at night
5178,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Around a lonely dwelling,"
5179,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Ounce whose gums were warm in his prey
5180,_THE NINTH BOOK._,He hears the summoning sound.
5181,_THE NINTH BOOK._,In vain his master's voice
5182,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"No longer dreaded now,"
5183,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Calls and recalls with threatful tone.
5184,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Away to the forest he goes,"
5185,_THE NINTH BOOK._,For that Old Woman had laid
5186,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her shrivelled finger on her shrivelled lips,"
5187,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And whistled with a long, long breath,"
5188,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And that long breath was the sound
5189,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Like the howl of the winter wind at night
5190,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Around a lonely dwelling.
5191,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5192,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Mohareb knew her not,"
5193,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"As to the chase he went,"
5194,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The glance of his proud eye
5195,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Passing in scorn o'er age and wretchedness.
5196,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She stands in the depth of the wood,"
5197,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And panting to her feet
5198,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Fawning and fearful creeps the charmed ounce.
5199,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Well mayst thou fear, and vainly dost thou fawn!"
5200,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her form is changed, her visage new,"
5201,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her power, her heart the same!"
5202,_THE NINTH BOOK._,It is Khawla that stands in the wood.
5203,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5204,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She knew the place where the mandrake grew,"
5205,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And round the neck of the ounce,"
5206,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And round the mandrake's head
5207,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She tightens the ends of her cord.
5208,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her ears are closed with wax,"
5209,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And her prest finger fastens them,"
5210,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Deaf as the Adder, when with grounded head"
5211,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And circled form, her avenues of sound"
5212,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Barred safely, one slant eye"
5213,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Watches the charmer's lips
5214,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Waste on the wind his[149] baffled witchery.
5215,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The spotted ounce so beautiful
5216,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Springs forceful from the scourge:
5217,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The dying plant all agony,"
5218,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Feeling its life-strings crack,"
5219,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Uttered the unimaginable groan
5220,_THE NINTH BOOK._,That none can hear and live.
5221,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5222,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Then from her victim servant Khawla loosed
5223,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The precious poison, next with naked hand"
5224,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She plucked the boughs of the manchineel.
5225,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Then of the wormy wax she took,"
5226,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"That from the perforated[150] tree forced out,"
5227,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Bewrayed its insect-parent's work within.
5228,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5229,_THE NINTH BOOK._,In a cavern of the wood she sits
5230,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And moulds the wax to human form,"
5231,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And as her fingers kneaded it,"
5232,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"By magic accents, to the mystic shape"
5233,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Imparted with the life of Thalaba,"
5234,_THE NINTH BOOK._,In all its passive powers
5235,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Mysterious sympathy.
5236,_THE NINTH BOOK._,With the Mandrake and the Manchineel
5237,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She builds her pile accurst.
5238,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She lays her finger to the pile,"
5239,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And blue and green, the flesh"
5240,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Glows with emitted fire,"
5241,_THE NINTH BOOK._,A fire[151] to kindle that strange fuel meet.
5242,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Before the fire she placed the imaged wax,"
5243,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""There[152] waste away!"" the Enchantress cried,"
5244,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""And with thee waste Hodeirah's Son!"""
5245,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5246,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Fool! fool! go thaw the everlasting ice,"
5247,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Whose polar mountains bound the human reign.
5248,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Blindly the wicked work
5249,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The righteous will of Heaven!
5250,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The doomed Destroyer wears Abdaldar's ring!
5251,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Against the danger of his horoscope
5252,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Yourselves have shielded him!
5253,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And on the sympathizing wax
5254,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The unadmitted flames play powerlessly,"
5255,_THE NINTH BOOK._,As the cold moon-beam on a plain of snow.
5256,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5257,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Curse thee! curse thee!"" cried the fiendly woman,"
5258,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Hast thou yet a spell of safety?"""
5259,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And in the raging flames
5260,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She cast the imaged wax.
5261,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"It lay amid the flames,"
5262,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Like Polycarp of old,"
5263,_THE NINTH BOOK._,When by the glories of the burning stake
5264,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"O'er vaulted, his grey hairs"
5265,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Curled, life-like, to the fire"
5266,_THE NINTH BOOK._,That haloed round his saintly brow.
5267,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5268,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Wherefore is this!"" cried Khawla, and she stamped"
5269,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Thrice on the cavern floor,"
5270,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Maimuna! Maimuna!"""
5271,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Thrice on the floor she stamped,"
5272,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Then to the rocky gateway glanced
5273,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her eager eyes, and Maimuna was there."
5274,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Nay Sister, nay!"" quoth she, ""Mohareb's life"
5275,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Is linked with Thalaba's!"
5276,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Nay Sister, nay! the plighted oath!"
5277,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""The common Sacrament!"""
5278,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5279,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Idiot!"" said Khawla, ""one must die, or all!"
5280,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Faith kept with him were treason to the rest."
5281,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Why lies the wax, like marble, in the fire?"
5282,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""What powerful amulet"
5283,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Protects Hodeirah's son?"""
5284,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5285,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Cold, marble-cold, the wax"
5286,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Lay on the raging pile,"
5287,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Cold in that white intensity of fire.
5288,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Bat that with her hooked and leathery wings
5289,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Clung to the cave-roof, loosed her hold,"
5290,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Death-sickening with the heat;
5291,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Toad who to the darkest nook had crawled
5292,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Panted fast with fever pain;
5293,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Viper from her nest came forth
5294,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Leading her quickened brood,"
5295,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Who sportive with the warm delight, rolled out"
5296,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Their thin curls, tender as the tendril rings,"
5297,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Ere the green beauty of their brittle youth
5298,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Grows brown, and toughens in the summer sun."
5299,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Cold, marble-cold, the wax"
5300,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Lay on the raging pile,"
5301,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The silver quivering of the element
5302,_THE NINTH BOOK._,O'er its pale surface shedding a dim gloss.
5303,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5304,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Amid the red and fiery smoke,"
5305,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Watching the strange portent,"
5306,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The blue-eyed Sorceress and her Sister stood,"
5307,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Seeming a ruined Angel by the side
5308,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Of Spirit born in Hell.
5309,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"At length raised Maimuna her thoughtful eyes,"
5310,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Whence Sister was the wax"
5311,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""The work of the worm, or the bee?"
5312,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Nay then I marvel not!"

5322,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5323,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Excellent witch!"" quoth Khawla; and she went"
5324,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"To the cave arch of entrance, and scowled up,"
5325,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Mocking the blessed Sun,"
5326,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Shine thou in Heaven, but I will shadow Earth!"
5327,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Thou wilt not shorten day,"
5328,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""But I will hasten darkness!"" Then the Witch"
5329,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Began a magic song,"
5330,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"One long low tone thro' teeth half-closed,"
5331,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Thro' lips slow-moving muttered slow,"
5332,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"One long-continued breath,"
5333,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Till to her eyes a darker yellowness
5334,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Was driven, and fuller swoln the prominent veins"
5335,_THE NINTH BOOK._,On her loose throat grew black.
5336,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Then looking upward thrice she breathed
5337,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Into the face of Heaven,"
5338,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The baneful breath infected Heaven;
5339,_THE NINTH BOOK._,A mildewing mist it spread
5340,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Darker and darker; so the evening sun
5341,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Poured his unentering glory on the mist,"
5342,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And it was night below.
5343,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5344,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Bring now the wax,"" quoth Khawla, ""for thou knowest"
5345,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""The mine that yields it!"" forth went Maimuna,"
5346,_THE NINTH BOOK._,In mist and darkness went the Sorceress forth.
5347,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And she has reached the place of Tombs,"
5348,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And in their sepulchres the dead
5349,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Feel[156] feet unholy trampling over them.
5350,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5351,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Thou startest Maimuna,"
5352,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Because the breeze is in thy lilted locks!
5353,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Is Khawla's spell so weak?
5354,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Sudden came the breeze and strong;
5355,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The mist that in the labouring lungs was felt
5356,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"So heavy late, flies now before the gale,"
5357,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Thin as an Infant's breath
5358,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Seen in the sunshine of an autumn frost.
5359,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Sudden it came and soon its work was done,"
5360,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And suddenly it ceased;
5361,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Cloudless and calm it left the firmament,"
5362,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And beautiful in the blue sky
5363,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Arose the summer Moon.
5364,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5365,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She heard the quickened action of her blood,"
5366,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She felt the fever in her cheeks.
5367,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Daunted, yet desperate, in a tomb"
5368,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Entering, with impious hand she traced"
5369,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Circles, and squares, and trines,"
5370,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And magic characters,"
5371,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Till riven by her charms the grave
5372,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Yawned and disclosed its dead,"
5373,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Maimuna's eyes were opened, and she saw"
5374,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The secrets of the grave.
5375,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5376,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"There sate a Spirit in the vault,"
5377,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"In shape, in hue, in lineaments like life,"
5378,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And by him couched, as if intranced,"
5379,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The hundred-headed Worm that never dies.
5380,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5381,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Nay Sorceress! not to-night!"" the Spirit cried,"
5382,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""The flesh in which I sinned may rest to-night"
5383,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""From suffering; all things, even I to-night,"
5384,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Even the Damned repose!"""
5385,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5386,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The flesh of Maimuna
5387,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Crept on her bones with terror, and her knees"
5388,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Trembled with their trembling weight.
5389,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Only this sabbath! and at dawn the Worm"
5390,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Will wake, and this poor flesh must grow to meet"
5391,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""The gnawing of his hundred[157] poison-mouths!"
5392,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""God! God! Is there no mercy after death?"""
5393,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5394,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Soul-struck she rushed away,"
5395,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She fled the place of Tombs,"
5396,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She cast herself upon the earth,"
5397,_THE NINTH BOOK._,All agony and tumult and despair.
5398,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And in that wild and desperate agony
5399,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Sure Maimuna had died the utter death,"
5400,_THE NINTH BOOK._,If aught of evil had been possible
5401,_THE NINTH BOOK._,On this mysterious night;
5402,_THE NINTH BOOK._,For this was that most holy[158] night
5403,_THE NINTH BOOK._,When all created things know and adore
5404,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The Power that made them; insects, beasts, and birds,"
5405,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The water-dwellers, herbs and trees and stones,"
5406,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Yea Earth and Ocean and the infinite Heaven
5407,_THE NINTH BOOK._,With all its worlds. Man only does not know
5408,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The universal sabbath, does not join"
5409,_THE NINTH BOOK._,With Nature in her homage. Yet the prayer
5410,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Flows from the righteous with intenser love,"
5411,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"A holier calm succeeds, and sweeter dreams"
5412,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Visit the slumbers of the penitent.
5413,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5414,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Therefore on Maimuna the elements,"
5415,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Shed healing; every breath she breathed was balm.
5416,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Was not a flower but sent in incense up
5417,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Its richest odours, and the song of birds"
5418,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Now, like the music of the Seraphim,"
5419,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Entered her soul, and now"
5420,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Made silence aweful by their sudden pause.
5421,_THE NINTH BOOK._,It seemed as if the quiet moon
5422,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Poured quietness, its lovely light"
5423,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Was like the smile of reconciling Heaven.
5424,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5425,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Is it the dew of night
5426,_THE NINTH BOOK._,That down her glowing cheek
5427,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Shines in the moon-beam? oh! she weeps ... she weeps
5428,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And the Good Angel that abandoned her
5429,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"At her hell-baptism, by her tears drawn down"
5430,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Resumes his charge, then Maimuna"
5431,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Recalled to mind the double oracle;
5432,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Quick as the lightening flash
5433,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Its import glanced upon her, and the hope"
5434,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Of pardon and salvation rose,"
5435,_THE NINTH BOOK._,As now she understood
5436,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The lying prophecy of truth.
5437,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She pauses not, she ponders not,"
5438,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The driven air before her fanned the face
5439,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Of Thalaba, and he awoke and saw"
5440,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Sorceress of the silver locks.
5441,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5442,_THE NINTH BOOK._,One more permitted spell!
5443,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She takes the magic chain.
5444,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"With the wide eye of wonder, Thalaba"
5445,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Watches her snowy fingers round and round
5446,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Wind the loosening chain.
5447,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Again he hears the low sweet voice,"
5448,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The low sweet voice so musical,"
5449,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"That sure it was not strange,"
5450,_THE NINTH BOOK._,If in those unintelligible tones
5451,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Was more than human potency,"
5452,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"That with such deep and undefined delight,"
5453,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Filled the surrendered soul.
5454,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The work is done, the song is ceased;"
5455,_THE NINTH BOOK._,He wakes as from a dream of Paradise
5456,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"And feels his fetters gone, and with the burst"
5457,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Of wondering adoration praises God.
5458,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5459,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her charm has loosed the chain it bound,"
5460,_THE NINTH BOOK._,But massy walls and iron gates
5461,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Confine Hodeirah's son.
5462,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Heard ye not, Genii of the Air, her spell,"
5463,_THE NINTH BOOK._,That o'er her face there flits
5464,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The sudden flush of fear?
5465,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Again her louder lips repeat the charm,"
5466,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her eye is anxious, her cheek pale,"
5467,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Her pulse plays fast and feeble.
5468,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Nay Maimuna! thy power has ceased,"
5469,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And the wind scatters now
5470,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The voice that ruled it late.
5471,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5472,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Pray for me, Thalaba,"" she cried,"
5473,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""For death and judgement are at hand!"""
5474,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"All night in agony,"
5475,_THE NINTH BOOK._,She feared the instant blow of Hell's revenge.
5476,_THE NINTH BOOK._,At dawn the sound of gathering multitudes
5477,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Led to the prison bars her dreading eye.
5478,_THE NINTH BOOK._,What spectacle invites
5479,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The growing multitude,"
5480,_THE NINTH BOOK._,That torrent-like they roll along?
5481,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Boys and grey-headed age; the Mother comes
5482,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Leading her child, who at arm's length"
5483,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Outstripping her, looks back"
5484,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And bids her hasten more.
5485,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5486,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Why does the City pour her thousands forth?
5487,_THE NINTH BOOK._,What glorious pageantry
5488,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Makes her streets desolate, and silences"
5489,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Her empty dwellings? comes the bridal pomp,"
5490,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And have the purveyors of imperial lust
5491,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Torn from their parents arms again
5492,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The virgin beauties of the land?
5493,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Will elephants in gilded cages bear
5494,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The imprisoned victims? or may yet their eyes
5495,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"With a last look of liberty, behold"
5496,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Banners and guards and silk-arched palanquins.
5497,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The long procession, and the gorgeous pomp"
5498,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Of their own sacrifice?
5499,_THE NINTH BOOK._,On the house tops and in the windows ranged
5500,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Face above face, they wait"
5501,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The coming spectacle;
5502,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The trees are clustered, and below the dust"
5503,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Thro' the thronged populace
5504,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Can find no way to rise.
5505,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5506,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"He comes! the Sultan! hark the swelling horn,"
5507,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The trumpet's spreading blair,"
5508,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The timbrel tinkling as its silver bells
5509,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Twinkle aloft, and the shrill cymbal's sound,"
5510,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Whose broad brass flashes in the morning sun
5511,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Accordant light and music! closing all
5512,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The heavy Gong is heard,"
5513,_THE NINTH BOOK._,That falls like thunder on the dizzy ear.
5514,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5515,_THE NINTH BOOK._,On either hand the thick-wedged crowd
5516,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Fall from the royal path.
5517,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Recumbent in the palanquin he casts
5518,_THE NINTH BOOK._,On the wide tumult of the waving throng
5519,_THE NINTH BOOK._,A proud and idle eye.
5520,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Now in his tent alighted, he receives"
5521,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Homage and worship. The slave multitude
5522,_THE NINTH BOOK._,With shouts of blasphemy adore
5523,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Him, father of his people! him their Lord!"
5524,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Great King, all-wise, all-mighty, and all-good!"
5525,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Whose smile was happiness, whose frown was death,"
5526,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Their present Deity!
5527,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5528,_THE NINTH BOOK._,With silken cords his slaves
5529,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Wave the silk[159] fan, that waving o'er his head"
5530,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Freshens the languid air.
5531,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Others the while shower o'er his robes
5532,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The rose's treasured sweets,"
5533,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Rich odours burn before him, ambergrese,"
5534,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Sandal and aloe wood,"
5535,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And thus inhaling the voluptuous air
5536,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"He sits to watch the agony,"
5537,_THE NINTH BOOK._,To hear the groan of death.
5538,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5539,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"At once all sounds are hushed,"
5540,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"All eyes take one direction, for he comes,"
5541,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The object he of this day's festival,"
5542,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Of all this expectation and this joy,"
5543,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Christian captive. Hark! so silently
5544,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"They stand, the clanking of his chain is heard."
5545,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And he has reached the place of suffering now.
5546,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And as the death's-men round his ancles bind
5547,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The cords and to the gibbet swing him up,"
5548,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The Priests begin their song, the song of praise,"
5549,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The hymn of glory to their Devil-God.
5550,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5551,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Then Maimuna grew pale, as thro the bars"
5552,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"She saw the Martyr pendant by the feet,"
5553,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"His gold locks hanging downwards, and she cried,"
5554,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""This is my Sister's deed!"
5555,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""O Thalaba, for us,"
5556,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Not for his faith the red-haired Christian dies."
5557,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""She wants the foam[160] that in his agony,"
5558,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Last from his lips shall fall,"
5559,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""The deadliest poison that the Devils know."
5560,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Son of Hodeirah, thou and I"
5561,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"""Shall prove its deadly force!"""
5562,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5563,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And lo! the Executioners begin
5564,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And beat his belly with alternate blows.
5565,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And these are human that look on;...
5566,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The very women that would shrink
5567,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And shudder if they saw a worm
5568,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Crushed by the careless tread,"
5569,_THE NINTH BOOK._,They clap their hands for joy
5570,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And lift their children up
5571,_THE NINTH BOOK._,To see the Christian die.
5572,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5573,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Convulsing Nature with her tortures drunk
5574,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Ceases to suffer now.
5575,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"His eye-lids tremble, his lips quake,"
5576,_THE NINTH BOOK._,But like the quivering of a severed limb
5577,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Move no responsive pang.
5578,_THE NINTH BOOK._,Now catch the exquisite poison! for it froths
5579,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"His dying lips,... and Khawla holds the bowl."
5580,_THE NINTH BOOK._,
5581,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"Enough the Island crimes had cried to Heaven,"
5582,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The measure of their guilt was full,"
5583,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The hour of wrath was come.
5584,_THE NINTH BOOK._,"The poison burst the bowl,"
5585,_THE NINTH BOOK._,It fell upon the earth.
5586,_THE NINTH BOOK._,The Sorceress shrieked and caught Mohareb's robe
5587,_THE NINTH BOOK._,And called the whirlwind and away!

5613,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5614,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Before the appointed Youth and Maimuna
5615,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Saw the first struggle of the dying throng,"
5616,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Crash sunk their prison wall!
5617,_THE TENTH BOOK._,The whirlwind wrapt them round;
5618,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Borne in the Chariot of the Winds
5619,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Ere there was time to fear, their way was past,"
5620,_THE TENTH BOOK._,And lo! again they stand
5621,_THE TENTH BOOK._,In the cave-dwelling of the blue-eyed Witch.
5622,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5623,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Then came the weakness of her natural age
5624,_THE TENTH BOOK._,At once on Maimuna;
5625,_THE TENTH BOOK._,The burthen of her years
5626,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Fell on her, and she knew"
5627,_THE TENTH BOOK._,That her repentance in the sight of God
5628,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Had now found favour, and her hour was come."
5629,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Her death was like the righteous; ""Turn my face"
5630,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"""To Mecca!"" in her languid eyes."
5631,_THE TENTH BOOK._,The joy of certain hope
5632,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Lit a last lustre, and in death"
5633,_THE TENTH BOOK._,The smile was on her cheek.
5634,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5635,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"No faithful[162] crowded round her bier,"
5636,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"No tongue reported her good deeds,"
5637,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"For her no mourners wailed and wept,"
5638,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"No Iman o'er her perfumed corpse,"
5639,_THE TENTH BOOK._,For her soul's health intoned the prayer;
5640,_THE TENTH BOOK._,No column[163] raised by the way side
5641,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Implored the passing traveller
5642,_THE TENTH BOOK._,To say a requiem for the dead.
5643,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Thalaba laid her in the snow,"
5644,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"And took his weapons from the hearth,"
5645,_THE TENTH BOOK._,And then once more the youth began
5646,_THE TENTH BOOK._,His weary way of solitude.
5647,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5648,_THE TENTH BOOK._,The breath of the East is in his face
5649,_THE TENTH BOOK._,And it drives the sleet and the snow.
5650,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"The air is keen, the wind is keen,"
5651,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"His limbs are aching with the cold,"
5652,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"His eyes are aching[164] with the snow,"
5653,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"His very heart is cold,"
5654,_THE TENTH BOOK._,His spirit chilled within him. He looks on
5655,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"If ought of life be near,"
5656,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"But all is sky and the white wilderness,"
5657,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"And here and there a solitary pine,"
5658,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Its branches broken by the weight of snow.
5659,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"His pains abate, his senses dull"
5660,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"With suffering, cease to suffer."
5661,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Languidly, languidly,"
5662,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Thalaba drags along,"
5663,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"A heavy weight is on his lids,"
5664,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"His limbs move slow with heaviness,"
5665,_THE TENTH BOOK._,And he full fain would sleep.
5666,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Not yet, not yet, O Thalaba!"
5667,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Thy hour of rest is come;
5668,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Not yet may the Destroyer sleep
5669,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"The comfortable sleep,"
5670,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"His journey is not over yet,"
5671,_THE TENTH BOOK._,His course not yet fulfilled;...
5672,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Run thou thy race, O Thalaba!"
5673,_THE TENTH BOOK._,The prize is at the goal.
5674,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5675,_THE TENTH BOOK._,It was a Cedar-tree
5676,_THE TENTH BOOK._,That woke him from the deadly drowsiness;
5677,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Its broad, round-spreading[165] branches when they felt"
5678,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"The snow, rose upward in a point to heaven,"
5679,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"And standing in their strength erect,"
5680,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Defied the baffled storm.
5681,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"He knew the lesson Nature gave,"
5682,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"And he shook off his heaviness,"
5683,_THE TENTH BOOK._,And hope revived within him.
5684,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5685,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Now sunk the evening sun,"
5686,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"A broad, red, beamless orb,"
5687,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Adown the glowing sky;
5688,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Thro' the red light the snow-flakes fell, like fire."
5689,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Louder grows the biting wind,"
5690,_THE TENTH BOOK._,And it drifts the dust of the snow.
5691,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"The snow is clotted in his hair,"
5692,_THE TENTH BOOK._,The breath of Thalaba
5693,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Is iced upon his lips.
5694,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"He looks around, the darkness,"
5695,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"The dizzy floating of the snow,"
5696,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Close in his narrow view.
5697,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5698,_THE TENTH BOOK._,At length thro' the thick atmosphere a light
5699,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Not distant far appears.
5700,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"He doubting other wiles of enmity,"
5701,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"With mingled joy and quicker step,"
5702,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Bends his way thitherward.
5703,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5704,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"It was a little, lowly dwelling place,"
5705,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Amid a garden, whose delightful air"
5706,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Felt mild and fragrant, as the evening wind"
5707,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Passing in summer o'er the coffee-groves[166]
5708,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Of Yemen and its blessed bowers of balm.
5709,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"A Fount of Fire that in the centre played,"
5710,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Rolled all around its wonderous rivulets
5711,_THE TENTH BOOK._,And fed the garden with the heat of life.
5712,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Every where magic! the Arabian's heart
5713,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Yearned after human intercourse.
5714,_THE TENTH BOOK._,A light!... the door unclosed!...
5715,_THE TENTH BOOK._,All silent ... he goes in.
5716,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5717,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"There lay a Damsel sleeping on a couch,"
5718,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"His step awoke her, and she gazed at him"
5719,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"With pleased and wondering look,"
5720,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"Fearlessly, like a yearling child"
5721,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Too ignorant to fear.
5722,_THE TENTH BOOK._,With words of courtesy
5723,_THE TENTH BOOK._,The young intruder spake.
5724,_THE TENTH BOOK._,At the sound of his voice a joy
5725,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Kindled her bright black eyes;
5726,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"She rose and took his hand,"
5727,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"But at the touch the smile forsook her cheek,"
5728,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"""Oh! it is cold!"" she cried,"
5729,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"""I thought I should have felt it warm like mine,"
5730,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"""But thou art like the rest!"""
5731,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5732,_THE TENTH BOOK._,Thalaba stood mute awhile
5733,_THE TENTH BOOK._,And wondering at her words:
5734,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"""Cold? Lady!"" then he said; ""I have travelled long"
5735,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"""In this cold wilderness,"
5736,_THE TENTH BOOK._,"""Till life is almost spent!"""
5737,_THE TENTH BOOK._,
5738,LAILA.,LAILA.
5739,LAILA.,
5740,LAILA.,Art thou a Man then?
5741,LAILA.,
5742,THALABA.,THALABA.
5743,THALABA.,
5744,THALABA.,I did not think
5745,THALABA.,"Sorrow and toil could so have altered me,"
5746,THALABA.,That I seem otherwise.
5747,THALABA.,
5748,LAILA.,LAILA.
5749,LAILA.,
5750,LAILA.,And thou canst be warm
5751,LAILA.,Sometimes? life-warm as I am?
5752,LAILA.,
5753,THALABA.,THALABA.
5754,THALABA.,
5755,THALABA.,Surely Lady
5756,THALABA.,"As others are, I am, to heat and cold"
5757,THALABA.,"Subject like all, you see a Traveller,"
5758,THALABA.,"Bound upon hard adventure, who requests"
5759,THALABA.,"Only to rest him here to-night, to-morrow"
5760,THALABA.,He will pursue his way.
5761,THALABA.,
5762,LAILA.,LAILA.
5763,LAILA.,
5764,LAILA.,Oh ... not to-morrow!
5765,LAILA.,"Not like a dream of joy, depart so soon!"
5766,LAILA.,And whither wouldst thou go? for all around
5767,LAILA.,"Is everlasting winter, ice and snow,"
5768,LAILA.,Deserts unpassable of endless frost.
5769,LAILA.,
5770,THALABA.,THALABA.
5771,THALABA.,
5772,THALABA.,He who has led me here will still sustain me
5773,THALABA.,Thro' cold and hunger.
5774,THALABA.,
5775,THALABA.,"""Hunger?"" Laila cried;"
5776,THALABA.,"She clapt her lilly hands,"
5777,THALABA.,And whether from above or from below
5778,THALABA.,"It came, sight could not see,"
5779,THALABA.,So suddenly the floor was spread with food.
5780,THALABA.,
5781,LAILA.,LAILA.
5782,LAILA.,
5783,LAILA.,Why dost thou watch with hesitating eyes
5784,LAILA.,The banquet? 'tis for thee! I bade it come.
5785,LAILA.,
5786,THALABA.,THALABA.
5787,THALABA.,
5788,THALABA.,Whence came it?
5789,THALABA.,
5790,LAILA.,LAILA.
5791,LAILA.,
5792,LAILA.,Matters it from whence it came
5793,LAILA.,"My father sent it: when I call, he hears."
5794,LAILA.,Nay ... thou hast fabled with me! and art like
5795,LAILA.,"The forms that wait upon my solitude,"
5796,LAILA.,Human to eye alone;... thy hunger would not
5797,LAILA.,Question so idly else.
5798,LAILA.,
5799,THALABA.,THALABA.
5800,THALABA.,
5801,THALABA.,I will not eat!
5802,THALABA.,It came by magic! fool to think that aught
5803,THALABA.,But fraud and danger could await me here!
5804,THALABA.,Let loose my cloak!...
5805,THALABA.,
5806,LAILA.,LAILA.
5807,LAILA.,
5808,LAILA.,"Begone then, insolent!"
5809,LAILA.,Why dost thou stand and gaze upon my face?
5810,LAILA.,Aye! watch the features well that threaten thee
5811,LAILA.,With fraud and danger! in the wilderness
5812,LAILA.,"They shall avenge me,... in the hour of want"
5813,LAILA.,"Rise on thy view, and make thee feel"
5814,LAILA.,How innocent I am:
5815,LAILA.,And this remembered cowardice and insult
5816,LAILA.,With a more painful shame will burn thy cheek
5817,LAILA.,Than now beats mine in anger!
5818,LAILA.,
5819,THALABA.,THALABA.
5820,THALABA.,
5821,THALABA.,Mark me Lady!
5822,THALABA.,Many and restless are my enemies;
5823,THALABA.,My daily paths have been beset with snares
5824,THALABA.,"Till I have learnt suspicion, bitter sufferings"
5825,THALABA.,"Teaching the needful vice, if I have wronged you,"
5826,THALABA.,"And yours should be the face of innocence,"
5827,THALABA.,"I pray you pardon me! in the name of God,"
5828,THALABA.,"And of his Prophet, I partake your food."
5829,THALABA.,
5830,LAILA.,LAILA.
5831,LAILA.,
5832,LAILA.,"Lo now! thou wert afraid of sorcery,"
5833,LAILA.,And yet hast said a charm!
5834,LAILA.,
5835,THALABA.,THALABA.
5836,THALABA.,
5837,THALABA.,A charm?
5838,THALABA.,
5839,LAILA.,LAILA.
5840,LAILA.,
5841,LAILA.,And wherefore?
5842,LAILA.,Is it not not delicate food? what mean thy words?
5843,LAILA.,I have heard many spells and many names
5844,LAILA.,"That rule the Genii and the Elements,"
5845,LAILA.,But never these.
5846,LAILA.,
5847,THALABA.,THALABA.
5848,THALABA.,
5849,THALABA.,How! never heard the names
5850,THALABA.,Of God and of the Prophet?
5851,THALABA.,
5852,LAILA.,LAILA.
5853,LAILA.,
5854,LAILA.,Never ... nay now
5855,LAILA.,Again that troubled eye? thou art a strange man
5856,LAILA.,And wonderous fearful ... but I must not twice
5857,LAILA.,"Be charged with fraud! if thou suspectest still,"
5858,LAILA.,Depart and leave me!
5859,LAILA.,
5860,THALABA.,THALABA.
5861,THALABA.,
5862,THALABA.,And you do not know
5863,THALABA.,The God that made you?
5864,THALABA.,
5865,LAILA.,LAILA.
5866,LAILA.,
5867,LAILA.,"Made me, man! my Father"
5868,LAILA.,"Made me. He made this dwelling, and the grove,"
5869,LAILA.,"And yonder fountain-fire, and every morn"
5870,LAILA.,"He visits me, and takes the snow, and moulds"
5871,LAILA.,"Women and men, like thee; and breathes into them"
5872,LAILA.,"Motion, and life, and sense,... but to the touch"
5873,LAILA.,"They are chilling cold, and ever when night closes"
5874,LAILA.,"They melt away again, and leave me here"
5875,LAILA.,Alone and sad. Oh then how I rejoice
5876,LAILA.,"When it is day and my dear Father comes,"
5877,LAILA.,And chears me with kind words and kinder looks!
5878,LAILA.,"My dear, dear, Father! were it not for him,"
5879,LAILA.,"I am so weary of this loneliness,"
5880,LAILA.,That I should wish I also were of snow
5881,LAILA.,"That I might melt away, and cease to be."
5882,LAILA.,
5883,THALABA.,THALABA.
5884,THALABA.,
5885,THALABA.,And have you always had your dwelling here
5886,THALABA.,Amid this solitude of snow?
5887,THALABA.,
5888,LAILA.,LAILA.
5889,LAILA.,
5890,LAILA.,I think so.
5891,LAILA.,I can remember with unsteady feet
5892,LAILA.,"Tottering from room to room, and finding pleasure"
5893,LAILA.,"In flowers and toys and sweetmeats, things that long"
5894,LAILA.,Have lost their power to please; that when I see them
5895,LAILA.,Raise only now a melancholy wish
5896,LAILA.,I were the little trifler once again
5897,LAILA.,That could be pleased so lightly!
5898,LAILA.,
5899,THALABA.,THALABA.
5900,THALABA.,
5901,THALABA.,Then you know not
5902,THALABA.,Your Father's art?
5903,THALABA.,
5904,LAILA.,LAILA.
5905,LAILA.,
5906,LAILA.,No. I besought him once
5907,LAILA.,"To give me power like his, that where he went"
5908,LAILA.,"I might go with him: but he shook his head,"
5909,LAILA.,"And said it was a power too dearly bought,"
5910,LAILA.,And kist me with the tenderness of tears.
5911,LAILA.,
5912,THALABA.,THALABA.
5913,THALABA.,
5914,THALABA.,And wherefore has he hidden you thus far
5915,THALABA.,From all the ways of humankind?
5916,THALABA.,
5917,LAILA.,LAILA.
5918,LAILA.,
5919,LAILA.,"'Twas fear,"
5920,LAILA.,Fatherly fear and love. He read[167] the stars
5921,LAILA.,"And saw a danger in my destiny,"
5922,LAILA.,"And therefore placed me here amid the snows,"
5923,LAILA.,"And laid a spell that never human eye,"
5924,LAILA.,If foot of man by chance should reach the depth
5925,LAILA.,"Of this wide waste, shall see one trace of grove,"
5926,LAILA.,"Garden, or dwelling-place, or yonder fire,"
5927,LAILA.,That thaws and mitigates the frozen sky.
5928,LAILA.,"And more than this, even if the enemy"
5929,LAILA.,"Should come, I have a guardian here."
5930,LAILA.,
5931,THALABA.,THALABA.
5932,THALABA.,
5933,THALABA.,A guardian?
5934,THALABA.,
5935,LAILA.,LAILA.
5936,LAILA.,
5937,LAILA.,'Twas well that when my sight unclosed upon thee
5938,LAILA.,There was no dark suspicion in thy face.
5939,LAILA.,Else I had called his succour! wilt thou see him?
5940,LAILA.,"But if a Woman can have terrified thee,"
5941,LAILA.,How wilt thou bare his unrelaxing brow
5942,LAILA.,And lifted lightnings?
5943,LAILA.,
5944,THALABA.,THALABA.
5945,THALABA.,
5946,THALABA.,"Lead me to him, Lady!"
5947,THALABA.,
5948,THALABA.,She took him by the hand
5949,THALABA.,And thro' the porch they past.
5950,THALABA.,Over the garden and the grove
5951,THALABA.,The fountain streams of fire
5952,THALABA.,Poured a broad light like noon.
5953,THALABA.,A broad unnatural light
5954,THALABA.,"That made the Rose's blush of beauty pale,"
5955,THALABA.,And dimmed the rich Geranium's scarlet blaze.
5956,THALABA.,The various verdure of the grove
5957,THALABA.,"Now wore one undistinguishable grey,"
5958,THALABA.,Checqured with blacker shade.
5959,THALABA.,"Suddenly Laila stopt,"
5960,THALABA.,"""I do not think thou art the enemy,"""
5961,THALABA.,"She said, ""but He will know!"
5962,THALABA.,"""If thou hast meditated wrong"
5963,THALABA.,"""Stranger, depart in time...."
5964,THALABA.,"""I would not lead thee to thy death!"""
5965,THALABA.,
5966,THALABA.,The glance of Laila's eye
5967,THALABA.,Turned anxiously toward the Arabian youth.
5968,THALABA.,"""So let him pierce my heart,"" cried Thalaba,"
5969,THALABA.,"""If it hide thought to harm you!"""
5970,THALABA.,
5971,LAILA.,LAILA.
5972,LAILA.,
5973,LAILA.,"'Tis a figure,"
5974,LAILA.,Almost I fear to look at!... yet come on.
5975,LAILA.,'Twill ease me of a heaviness that seems
5976,LAILA.,To sink my heart; and thou mayest dwell here then.
5977,LAILA.,"In safety;... for thou shalt not go to-morrow,"
5978,LAILA.,"Nor on the after, nor the after day,"
5979,LAILA.,Nor ever! it was only solitude
5980,LAILA.,"That made my misery here,..."
5981,LAILA.,"And now that I can see a human face,"
5982,LAILA.,And hear a human voice....
5983,LAILA.,Oh no! thou wilt not leave me!
5984,LAILA.,
5985,THALABA.,THALABA.
5986,THALABA.,
5987,THALABA.,Alas I must not rest!
5988,THALABA.,The star that ruled at my nativity
5989,THALABA.,Shone with a strange and blasting influence.
5990,THALABA.,O gentle Lady! I should draw upon you
5991,THALABA.,A killing curse.
5992,THALABA.,
5993,LAILA.,LAILA.
5994,LAILA.,
5995,LAILA.,But I will ask my Father
5996,LAILA.,"To save you from all danger, and you know not"
5997,LAILA.,"The wonders he can work, and when I ask"
5998,LAILA.,It is not in his power to say me nay.
5999,LAILA.,Perhaps thou knowest the happiness it is
6000,LAILA.,To have a tender father?
6001,LAILA.,
6002,THALABA.,THALABA.
6003,THALABA.,
6004,THALABA.,He was one
6005,THALABA.,Whom like a loathsome leper I have tainted
6006,THALABA.,With my contagious destiny. At evening
6007,THALABA.,"He kist me as he wont, and laid his hands"
6008,THALABA.,"Upon my head, and blest me ere I slept."
6009,THALABA.,"His dying groan awoke me, for the Murderer"
6010,THALABA.,Had stolen upon our sleep! for me was meant
6011,THALABA.,"The midnight blow of death; my father died,"
6012,THALABA.,"The brother play-mates of my infancy,"
6013,THALABA.,"The baby at the breast, they perished all,"
6014,THALABA.,All in that dreadful hour: but I was saved
6015,THALABA.,To remember and revenge.
6016,THALABA.,
6017,THALABA.,"She answered not, for now"
6018,THALABA.,Emerging from the o'er-arched avenue
6019,THALABA.,The finger of her upraised hand
6020,THALABA.,Marked where the Guardian of the garden stood.
6021,THALABA.,"It was a brazen[168] Image, every limb"
6022,THALABA.,"And swelling vein and muscle, true to life:"
6023,THALABA.,"The left knee bending on,"
6024,THALABA.,"The other straight, firm planted, and his hand"
6025,THALABA.,Lifted on high to hurl
6026,THALABA.,The Lightning that it grasped.
6027,THALABA.,
6028,THALABA.,"When Thalaba approached,"
6029,THALABA.,"The charmed Image knew Hodeirah's son,"
6030,THALABA.,And hurled the lightning at the dreaded foe.
6031,THALABA.,The Ring! the saviour Ring!
6032,THALABA.,"Full in his face the lightning-bolt was driven,"
6033,THALABA.,The scattered fire recoiled.
6034,THALABA.,Like the flowing of a summer gale he felt
6035,THALABA.,"Its ineffectual force,"
6036,THALABA.,"His countenance was not changed,"
6037,THALABA.,Nor a hair of his head was singed.
6038,THALABA.,
6039,THALABA.,He started and his glance
6040,THALABA.,"Turned angrily upon the Maid,"
6041,THALABA.,"The sight disarmed suspicion ... breathless, pale,"
6042,THALABA.,Against a tree she stood.
6043,THALABA.,"Her wan lips quivering, and her eye"
6044,THALABA.,"Upraised, in silent supplicating fear."
6045,THALABA.,

6047,THALABA.,"Seeing her Father there,"
6048,THALABA.,"And ran and threw her arms around his neck,"
6049,THALABA.,"""Save me!"" she cried, ""the Enemy is come!"
6050,THALABA.,"""Save me! save me! Okba!"""
6051,THALABA.,
6052,THALABA.,"""Okba!"" repeats the youth,"
6053,THALABA.,For never since that hour
6054,THALABA.,"When in the Tent the Spirit told his name,"
6055,THALABA.,Had Thalaba let slip
6056,THALABA.,The memory of his Father's murderer;
6057,THALABA.,"""Okba!""... and in his hand"
6058,THALABA.,He graspt an arrow-shaft.
6059,THALABA.,And he rushed on to strike him.
6060,THALABA.,
6061,THALABA.,"""Son of Hodeirah!"" the Old Man replied,"
6062,THALABA.,"""My hour is not yet come."""
6063,THALABA.,And putting forth his hand
6064,THALABA.,Gently he repelled the Youth.
6065,THALABA.,"""My hour is not yet come!"
6066,THALABA.,"""But thou mayest shed this innocent Maiden's blood,"

6072,THALABA.,"A broad light floated o'er its marble paleness,"
6073,THALABA.,As the wind waved the fountain fire.
6074,THALABA.,"Her large, dilated eye in horror raised"
6075,THALABA.,Watched his every movement.

6083,THALABA.,"""Thou dost not aim the blow more eagerly,"""

6090,THALABA.,"""Permits, commands the deed."""
6091,THALABA.,
6092,THALABA.,"""Liar!"" quoth Thalaba."
6093,THALABA.,And Laila's wondering eye
6094,THALABA.,"Looked up, all anguish to her Father's face,"
6095,THALABA.,"""By Allah and the Prophet,"" he replied,"
6096,THALABA.,"""I speak the words of truth."

6123,THALABA.,And Azrael stood among them.
6124,THALABA.,In equal terror at the sight
6125,THALABA.,"The Enchanter, the Destroyer stood,"
6126,THALABA.,"And Laila, the victim maid."
6127,THALABA.,
6128,THALABA.,"""Son of Hodeirah!"" said the Angel of Death,"

6152,THALABA.,
6153,THALABA.,"""So be it!"" said the Youth."
6154,THALABA.,"""He who can read the secrets of the heart"
6155,THALABA.,"""Will judge with righteousness!"
6156,THALABA.,"""This is no doubtful path,"
6157,THALABA.,"""The voice of God within me cannot lie...."
6158,THALABA.,"""I will not harm the innocent."""
6159,THALABA.,
6160,THALABA.,"He said, and from above,"
6161,THALABA.,"As tho' it were the Voice of Night,"
6162,THALABA.,The startling answer came.
6163,THALABA.,"""Son of Hodeirah, think again!"
6164,THALABA.,"""One must depart from hence,"
6165,THALABA.,"""Laila, or Thalaba;"
6166,THALABA.,"""She dies for thee, or thou for her,"
6167,THALABA.,"""It must be life for life!"

6169,THALABA.,"""While yet the choice is thine!"""
6170,THALABA.,
6171,THALABA.,"He hesitated not,"

6176,THALABA.,"""What!"" exclaimed Okba, ""darest thou disobey,"
6177,THALABA.,"""Abandoning all claim"

6179,THALABA.,
6180,THALABA.,The eager exultation of his speech
6181,THALABA.,Earthward recalled the thoughts of Thalaba.
6182,THALABA.,"""And dost thou triumph, Murderer? dost thou deem"
6183,THALABA.,"""Because I perish, that the unsleeping lids"
6184,THALABA.,"""Of Justice shall be closed upon thy crime?"

6190,THALABA.,"""Servant of Allah, thou hast disobeyed,"
6191,THALABA.,"""God hath abandoned thee,"
6192,THALABA.,"""This hour is mine!"" cried Okba,"
6193,THALABA.,"And shook his Daughter off,"
6194,THALABA.,And drew the dagger from his vest.
6195,THALABA.,And aimed the deadly blow.
6196,THALABA.,
6197,THALABA.,All was accomplished. Laila rushed between
6198,THALABA.,To save the saviour Youth.
6199,THALABA.,"She met the blow and sunk into his arms,"
6200,THALABA.,And Azrael from the hands[172] of Thalaba
6201,THALABA.,Received her parting soul.

6244,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Pitying and silently he heard
6245,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The victim of his own iniquities,"
6246,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Not with the busy hand
6247,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Of Consolation, fretting the sore wound"
6248,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,He could not hope to heal.
6249,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6250,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"So as the Servant of the Prophet stood,"
6251,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,With sudden motion the night air
6252,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Gently fanned his cheek.
6253,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,'Twas a Green Bird whose wings

6255,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,On the hand of Thalaba

6262,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And now his hand perceives

6265,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6266,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Obedient to the call,"
6267,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,By the pale moonlight Thalaba pursued
6268,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,O'er trackless snows his way;
6269,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Unknowing he what blessed messenger
6270,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Had come to guide his steps,"

6282,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,In this wide solitude;
6283,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"His radiance with a saffron hue, like heat,"
6284,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Suffused the desert snow.
6285,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Green Bird guided Thalaba,"
6286,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Now oaring with slow wing her upward way,"
6287,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Descending now in slant descent
6288,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"On out-spread pinions motionless,"
6289,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Floating now with rise and fall alternate,"
6290,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,As if the billows of the air

6293,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And when, beneath the noon,"
6294,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The icey glitter of the snow

6297,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And spread before his eyes
6298,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Her plumage of refreshing hue.
6299,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Evening came on; the glowing clouds
6300,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Tinged with a purple ray the mountain ridge

6310,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Arabian youth knelt down,"
6311,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And bowed his forehead to the ground
6312,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And made his evening prayer.
6313,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"When he arose the stars were bright in heaven,"
6314,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The sky was blue, and the cold Moon"
6315,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Shone over the cold snow.
6316,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,A speck in the air!
6317,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Is it his guide that approaches?
6318,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,For it moves with the motion of life!
6319,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Lo! she returns and scatters from her pinions
6320,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Odours diviner than the gales of morning
6321,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Waft from Sabea.
6322,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6323,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Hovering before the youth she hung,"
6324,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Till from her rosy feet that at his touch
6325,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Uncurled their grasp, he took"
6326,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The fruitful bough they bore.
6327,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"He took and tasted, a new life"
6328,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Flowed thro' his renovated frame;
6329,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,His limbs that late were sore and stiff
6330,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Felt all the freshness of repose,"
6331,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,His dizzy brain was calmed.
6332,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The heavy aching of his lids
6333,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"At once was taken off,"
6334,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,For Laila from the Bowers of Paradise
6335,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Had borne the healing[174] fruit.
6336,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6337,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,So up the mountain steep
6338,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"With untired foot he past,"
6339,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The Green Bird guiding him
6340,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Mid crags, and ice, and rocks,"
6341,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"A difficult way, winding the long ascent."
6342,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,How then the heart of Thalaba rejoiced
6343,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"When bosomed in the mountain depths,"
6344,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,A sheltered Valley opened on his view!
6345,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"It was the Simorg's vale,"
6346,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The dwelling of the ancient Bird.

6348,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,On a green and mossy bank.
6349,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Beside a rivulet

6351,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"No sound intruded on his solitude,"
6352,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Only the rivulet was heard
6353,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Whose everlasting flow
6354,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,From the birth-day of the world had made
6355,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The same unvaried murmuring.
6356,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Here dwelt the all-knowing Bird
6357,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"In deep tranquillity,"
6358,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,His eyelids ever closed
6359,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,In full enjoyment of profound repose.
6360,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6361,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Reverently the youth approached
6362,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"That old and only[175] Bird,"
6363,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And crossed his arms upon his breast,"
6364,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And bowed his head and spake.
6365,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Earliest of existing things,"

6374,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The ancient Simorg on the youth
6375,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Unclosed his thoughtful eyes,"
6376,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And answered to his prayer.
6377,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Northward by the stream proceed,"

6385,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The ancient Simorg then let fall his lids
6386,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Returning to repose.
6387,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6388,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Northward along the rivulet
6389,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The adventurer went his way,"
6390,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Tracing its waters upward to their source.
6391,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Green Bird of Paradise
6392,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Thou hast not left the youth;...
6393,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,With slow associate flight
6394,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"She companies his way,"
6395,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And now they reach the fountain of the rock.
6396,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6397,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,There in the cold clear well
6398,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Thalaba washed away his earthly stains,"
6399,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And bowed his face before the Lord,"

6403,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And pondering all the perils he must pass,"
6404,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,With a mild melancholy eye

6406,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6407,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And lo! beneath yon lonely pine, the sledge...."

6410,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Their ears erected turned towards his way.
6411,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"They were lean as lean might be,"
6412,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Their furrowed ribs rose prominent,"
6413,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And they were black from head to foot,"
6414,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Save a white line on every breast
6415,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Curved like the crescent moon.
6416,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And he is seated in the sledge,"
6417,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"His arms are folded on his breast,"
6418,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The bird is on his knees;
6419,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"There is fear in the eyes of the Dogs,"

6424,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The Youth with the start of their speed
6425,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Falls back to the bar of the sledge,"
6426,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,His hair floats straight in the stream of the wind
6427,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Like the weeds in the running brook.
6428,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"They wind with speed the upward way,"
6429,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"An icey path thro' rocks of ice,"
6430,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"His eye is at the summit now,"

6436,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,They moan and moan with fear.
6437,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6438,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Once more away! and now
6439,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The long descent is seen,"
6440,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"A long, long, narrow path."
6441,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Ice-rocks aright and hills of snow,"
6442,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Aleft the giddy precipice.
6443,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Be firm, be firm, O Thalaba!"
6444,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"One motion now, one bend,"
6445,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And on the crags below
6446,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Thy shattered flesh will harden in the frost.
6447,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Why howl the Dogs so mournfully?
6448,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And wherefore does the blood flow fast
6449,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,All purple o'er their sable hair?
6450,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"His arms are folded on his breast,"
6451,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor scourge nor goad has he,"
6452,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"No hand appears to strike,"
6453,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,No sounding lash is heard:
6454,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,But piteously they moan and moan
6455,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And track their way with blood.
6456,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6457,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And lo! on yonder height
6458,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,A giant Fiend aloft
6459,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Waits to thrust down the tottering Avalanche!
6460,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"If Thalaba looks back he dies,"
6461,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The motion of fear is death.
6462,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,On ... on ... with swift and steady pace
6463,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Adown that dreadful way!
6464,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The youth is firm, the Dogs are fleet,"
6465,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Sledge goes rapidly,"
6466,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The thunder of the avalanche
6467,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Re-echoes far behind.
6468,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,On ... on ... with swift and steady pace
6469,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Adown that dreadful way!
6470,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Dogs are fleet, the way is steep"
6471,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Sledge goes rapidly,"
6472,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,They reach the plain below.
6473,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6474,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"A wide, wide plain, all desolate,"
6475,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor tree, nor bush, nor herb!"
6476,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"On go the Dogs with rapid step,"
6477,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Sledge slides after rapidly,"
6478,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And now the Sun went down.
6479,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"They stopt and looked at Thalaba,"
6480,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The Youth performed his prayer;
6481,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,They knelt beside him as he prayed
6482,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,They turned their heads to Mecca
6483,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And tears ran down their cheeks.
6484,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Then down they laid them in the snow
6485,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"As close as they could lie,"
6486,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,They laid them down and slept.
6487,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And backward in the sledge
6488,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Adventurer laid him down,"
6489,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"There peacefully slept Thalaba,"
6490,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And the Green Bird of Paradise
6491,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Lay in his bosom warm.
6492,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6493,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Dogs awoke him at the dawn,"
6494,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,They knelt and wept again;
6495,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Then rapidly they journeyed on,"
6496,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And still the plain was desolate,"
6497,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor tree, nor bush, nor herb!"
6498,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And ever at the hour of prayer
6499,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"They stopt, and knelt, and wept;"
6500,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And still that green and graceful Bird
6501,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Was as a friend to him by day,"
6502,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And ever when at night he slept
6503,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Lay in his bosom warm.
6504,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,In that most utter solitude
6505,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,It cheered his heart to hear
6506,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Her soft and soothing voice;
6507,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Her voice was soft and sweet,"
6508,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"It swelled not with the blackbird's thrill,"
6509,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor warbled rich like the dear bird, that holds"
6510,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The solitary man
6511,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,A loiterer in his thoughtful walk at eve;
6512,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,But if no overflowing joy
6513,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Spake in its tones of tenderness
6514,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,They soothed the softened soul.
6515,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Her bill was not the beak of blood;
6516,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"There was a human meaning in her eye,"
6517,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Its mild affection fixed on Thalaba
6518,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Woke wonder while he gazed
6519,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And made her dearer for the mystery.
6520,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6521,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Oh joy! the signs of life appear,"
6522,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The first and single Fir
6523,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,That on the limits of the living world
6524,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Strikes in the ice its roots.
6525,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Another, and another now;"
6526,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And now the Larch that flings its arms
6527,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Down arching like the falling wave;
6528,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And now the Aspin's scattered leaves
6529,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Grey glitter on the moveless twig;
6530,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Poplar's varying verdure now,"
6531,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And now the Birch so beautiful,"
6532,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Light as a Lady's plumes.
6533,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Oh joy! the signs of life! the Deer
6534,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Hath left his slot beside the way;
6535,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The little Ermine now is seen
6536,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,White wanderer of the snow;
6537,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And now from yonder pines they hear
6538,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The clatter of the Grouse's wings:
6539,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And now the snowy Owl pursues
6540,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The Traveller's sledge in hope of food;
6541,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And hark! the rosy-breasted bird
6542,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The Throstle of sweet song!
6543,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Joy! joy! the winter-wilds are left!
6544,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Green bushes now and greener grass,"
6545,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Red thickets here all berry-bright,"
6546,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And here the lovely flowers!
6547,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6548,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"When the last morning of their way arrived,"
6549,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"After the early prayer,"
6550,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The Green Bird fixed on Thalaba
6551,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"A sad and supplicating eye,"
6552,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And with a human voice she spake,"
6553,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Servant of God, I leave thee now."
6554,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""If rightly I have guided thee,"
6555,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Give me the boon I beg!"""
6556,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6557,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""O gentle Bird,"" quoth Thalaba,"
6558,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Guide and companion of my dangerous way,"
6559,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Friend and sole solace of my solitude,"
6560,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""How can I pay thee benefits like these!"
6561,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Ask what thou wilt that I can give,"
6562,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""O gentle Bird, the poor return"
6563,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Will leave me debtor still!"""
6564,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6565,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Son of Hodeirah!"" she replied,"
6566,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""When thou shalt see an Old Man crushed beneath"
6567,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""The burthen of his earthly punishment,"
6568,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Forgive him, Thalaba!"
6569,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Yea, send a prayer to God on his behalf!"""
6570,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6571,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"A flush o'erspread the young Destroyer's cheek,"
6572,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,He turned his eye towards the Bird
6573,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,As if in half repentance; for he thought
6574,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Of Okba; and his Father's dying groan
6575,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Came on his memory. The celestial Bird
6576,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Saw and renewed her speech.
6577,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""O Thalaba, if she who in thine arms"
6578,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Received the dagger-blow and died for thee,"
6579,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Deserve one kind remembrance ... save, O save"
6580,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""The Father that she loved from endless death!"""
6581,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6582,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Laila! and is it thou?"" the youth replied:"
6583,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""What is there that I durst refuse to thee?"
6584,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""This is no time to harbour in my heart"
6585,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""One evil thought ... here I put off revenge,"
6586,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""The last rebellious feeling ... be it so!"
6587,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""God grant to me the pardon that I need"
6588,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""As I do pardon him!"
6589,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""But who am I that I should save"
6590,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""The sinful soul alive?"""
6591,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6592,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Enough!"" said Laila. ""When the hour shall come"
6593,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Remember me! my task is done."
6594,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""We meet again in Paradise!"""
6595,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"She said and shook her wings, and up she soared"
6596,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,With arrow-swiftness thro' the heights of Heaven.
6597,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6598,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"His aching eye pursued her path,"
6599,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"When starting onward went the Dogs,"
6600,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,More rapidly they hurried on
6601,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,In hope of near repose.
6602,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,It was the early morning yet
6603,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,When by the well-head of a brook
6604,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"They stopt, their journey done."
6605,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The spring was clear, the water deep,"
6606,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,A venturous man were he and rash
6607,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"That should have probed its depths,"
6608,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,For all its loosened bed below
6609,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Heaved strangely up and down,"
6610,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And to and fro, from side to side"
6611,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"It heaved, and waved, and tossed,"
6612,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And yet the depths were clear,"
6613,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And yet no ripple wrinkled o'er
6614,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The face of that fair Well.
6615,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6616,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And on that Well so strange and fair
6617,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"A little boat there lay,"
6618,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Without on oar, without a sail,"
6619,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"One only seat it had, one seat"
6620,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,As if for only Thalaba.
6621,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And at the helm a Damsel stood
6622,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"A Damsel bright and bold of eye,"
6623,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Yet did a maiden modesty
6624,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Adorn her fearless brow.
6625,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"She seemed sorrowful, but sure"
6626,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,More beautiful for sorrow.
6627,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"To her the Dogs looked wistful up,"
6628,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And then their tongues were loosed,"
6629,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Have we done well, O Mistress dear!"
6630,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""And shall our sufferings end?"""
6631,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6632,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The gentle Damsel made reply,"
6633,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Poor Servants of the God I serve,"
6634,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""When all this witchery is destroyed"
6635,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Your woes will end with mine."
6636,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""A hope, alas! how long unknown!"
6637,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""This new adventurer gives:"
6638,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Now God forbid that he, like you,"
6639,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Should perish for his fears!"
6640,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Poor Servants of the God I serve"
6641,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Wait ye the event in peace."""
6642,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,A deep and total slumber as she spake
6643,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Seized them. Sleep on, poor sufferers! be at rest!"
6644,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Ye wake no more to anguish. Ye have borne
6645,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Chosen, the Destroyer! soon his hand"
6646,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Shall strike the efficient blow,"
6647,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Soon shaking off your penal forms shall ye
6648,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,With songs of joy amid the Eden groves
6649,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Hymn the Deliverer's praise!
6650,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6651,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Then did the Damsel say to Thalaba,"
6652,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""The morn is young, the Sun is fair"
6653,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""And pleasantly thro' pleasant banks"
6654,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""The quiet brook flows on...."
6655,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Wilt thou embark with me?"
6656,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Thou knowest not the water's way,"
6657,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Think Stranger well! and night must come,..."
6658,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Wilt thou embark with me?"
6659,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Thro' fearful perils thou must pass,..."
6660,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Stranger, the oppressed ask thine aid!"
6661,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Thou wilt embark with me!"""
6662,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6663,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"She smiled in tears upon the youth,..."
6664,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,What heart were his who could gainsay
6665,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,That melancholy smile?
6666,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Sail on, sail on,"" quoth Thalaba,"
6667,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Sail on, in Allah's name!"""
6668,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6669,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"He sate him on the single seat,"
6670,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The little boat moved on.
6671,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Thro' pleasant banks the quiet brook
6672,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Went winding pleasantly;
6673,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"By fragrant fir groves now it past,"
6674,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And now thro' alder-shores,"
6675,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Thro' green and fertile meadows now
6676,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,It silently ran by.
6677,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The flag-flower blossomed on its side,"
6678,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The willow tresses waved,"
6679,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The flowing current furrowed round
6680,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The water-lilly's floating leaf,"
6681,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The fly of green and gauzy wing
6682,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Fell sporting down its course.
6683,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And grateful to the voyager
6684,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The freshness of the running stream,"
6685,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The murmur round the prow.
6686,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The little boat falls rapidly
6687,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Adown the rapid brook.
6688,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6689,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"But many a silent spring meantime,"
6690,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And many a rivulet
6691,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Had swoln the growing brook,"
6692,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And when the southern Sun began
6693,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"To wind the downward way of heaven,"
6694,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,It ran a river deep and wide
6695,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Thro' banks that widened still.
6696,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Then once again the Damsel spake,"
6697,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""The stream is strong, the river broad,"
6698,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Wilt thou go on with me?"
6699,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""The day is fair but night must come...."
6700,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Wilt thou go on with me?"
6701,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"""Far far away the mourner's eye"

6706,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The little boat falls rapidly
6707,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Adown the river-stream.
6708,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6709,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,A broader and a broader stream.
6710,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,That rocked the little boat!
6711,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Cormorant stands upon its shoals,"
6712,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,His black and dripping wings
6713,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Half opened to the wind.
6714,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Sun goes down, the crescent Moon"
6715,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Is brightening in the firmament;
6716,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And what is yonder roar
6717,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"That sinking now and swelling now,"
6718,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"But roaring, roaring still,"
6719,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Still louder, louder, grows?"
6720,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The little boat falls rapidly
6721,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Adown the rapid tide,"

6723,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And the wide Ocean opens on their way!
6724,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6725,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Then did the Damsel speak again

6734,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6735,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The Moon is bright, the sea is calm,"
6736,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The little boat rides rapidly
6737,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Across the ocean waves;
6738,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The line of moonlight on the deep
6739,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Still follows as they voyage on;
6740,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The winds are motionless;
6741,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The gentle waters gently part
6742,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,In murmurs round the prow.
6743,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"He looks above, he looks around,"
6744,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The boundless heaven, the boundless sea,"

6753,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Without an oar, without a sail"
6754,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The little boat rides rapidly;...
6755,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Is that a cloud that skirts the sea?
6756,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,There is no cloud in heaven!
6757,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"And nearer now, and darker now...."
6758,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,It is ... it is ... the Land!
6759,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,For yonder are the rocks that rise
6760,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"Dark in the reddening morn,"
6761,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,For loud around their hollow base
6762,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,The surges rage and roar.
6763,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,
6764,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The little boat rides rapidly,"
6765,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And now with shorter toss it heaves
6766,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,Upon the heavier swell;
6767,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And now so near they see
6768,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,"The shelves and shadows of the cliff,"
6769,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,And the low-lurking rocks
6770,THE ELEVENTH BOOK.,O'er whose black summits hidden-half

6825,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,His spirit troubled with tumultuous hope
6826,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Toiled with futurity.
6827,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"His brain, with busier workings, felt"
6828,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The roar and raving of the restless sea,"
6829,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The boundless waves that rose and rolled and rocked;
6830,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The everlasting sound
6831,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Opprest him, and the heaving infinite,"
6832,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,He closed his lids for rest.
6833,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6834,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Meantime with fuller reach and stronger swell
6835,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Wave after wave advanced;
6836,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Each following billow lifted the last foam
6837,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,That trembled on the sand with rainbow hues;
6838,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The living flower, that, rooted to the rock,"
6839,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Late from the thinner element
6840,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Shrunk down within its purple stem to sleep,"
6841,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Now feels the water, and again"
6842,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Awakening blossoms out
6843,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,All its green anther-necks.
6844,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6845,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Was there a Spirit in the gale
6846,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,That fluttered o'er his cheek?
6847,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,For it came on him like the gentle sun
6848,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"That plays and dallies o'er the night-closed flower,"
6849,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And woos it to unfold anew to joy;
6850,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,For it came on him as the dews of eve
6851,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Descend with healing and with life
6852,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Upon the summer mead;
6853,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Or liker the first sound of seraph song
6854,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"And Angel hail, to him"
6855,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Whose latest sense had shuddered at the groan
6856,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Of anguish, kneeling by his death bed-side."
6857,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6858,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,He starts and gazes round to seek
6859,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The certain presence. ""Thalaba!"" exclaimed"
6860,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The Voice of the Unseen;...
6861,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Father of my Oneiza!"" he replied,"
6862,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""And have thy years been numbered? art thou too"
6863,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Among the Angels?"" ""Thalaba!"""
6864,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"A second and a dearer voice repeats,"
6865,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Go in the favour of the Lord"
6866,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""My Thalaba go on!"
6867,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""My husband. I have drest our bower of bliss."
6868,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Go and perform the work,"
6869,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Let me not longer suffer hope in heaven!"""
6870,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6871,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"He turned an eager glance towards the sea,"
6872,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Come!"" quoth the Damsel, and she drove"
6873,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Her little boat to land.
6874,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Impatient thro' the rising wave
6875,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"He rushed to meet its way,"
6876,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"His eye was bright, his cheek was flushed with joy."
6877,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Hast thou had comfort in thy prayers?"" she cried,"
6878,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Yea,"" answered Thalaba,"
6879,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""A heavenly visitation."" ""God be praised!"""
6880,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"She uttered, ""then I do not hope in vain!"""
6881,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"And her voice trembled, and her lips"
6882,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Quivered, and tears ran down."
6883,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Stranger,"" quoth she, ""in years long past"
6884,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Was one who vowed himself"
6885,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""The Champion of the Lord like thee"
6886,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Against the race of Hell."
6887,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Young was he, as thyself,"
6888,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Gentle, and yet so brave!"
6889,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""A lion-hearted man."
6890,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Shame on me, Stranger! in the arms of love"
6891,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""I held him from his calling, till the hour"
6892,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Was past, and then the Angel who should else"
6893,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Have crowned him with his glory-wreath,"
6894,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Smote him in anger ... years and years are gone...."
6895,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""And in his place of penance he awaits"
6896,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Thee the Deliverer, surely thou art he!"
6897,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""It was my righteous punishment"
6898,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""In the same youth unchanged and changeless love,"
6899,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""And fresh affliction and keen penitence"
6900,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""To abide the written hour when I should waft"
6901,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""The doomed Destroyer and Deliverer here."
6902,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Remember thou that thy success involves"
6903,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""No single fate, no common misery."""
6904,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6905,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"As thus she spake, the entrance of the cave"
6906,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Darkened the boat below.
6907,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Around them from their nests,"
6908,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The screaming sea-birds fled.
6909,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Wondering at that strange shape
6910,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Yet unalarmed at sight of living man,"
6911,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Unknowing of his sway and power misused;
6912,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The clamours of their young
6913,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Echoed in shriller yells
6914,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,That rung in wild discordance round the rock.
6915,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And farther as they now advanced
6916,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The dim reflection of the darkened day
6917,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Grew fainter, and the dash"
6918,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Of the out-breakers deadened; farther yet
6919,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"And yet more faint the gleam,"
6920,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And there the waters at their utmost bound
6921,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Silently rippled on the rising rock.
6922,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"They landed and advanced, and deeper in"
6923,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Two adamantine doors
6924,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Closed up the cavern pass.
6925,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6926,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Reclining on the rock beside
6927,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Sate a grey-headed man
6928,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Watching an hour-glass by.
6929,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"To him the Damsel spake,"
6930,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Is it the hour appointed?"" the old man"
6931,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Nor answered her awhile,"
6932,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Nor lifted he his downward eye,"
6933,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"For now the glass ran low,"
6934,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And like the days of age
6935,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"With speed perceivable,"
6936,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The latter sands descend:
6937,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And now the last are gone.
6938,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Then he looked up, and raised his arm, and smote"
6939,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The adamantine gates.
6940,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6941,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The gates of adamant
6942,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Unfolding at the stroke
6943,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Opened and gave the entrance. Then She turned
6944,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,To Thalaba and said
6945,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Go in the name of God!"
6946,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""I cannot enter,... I must wait the end"
6947,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""In hope and agony."
6948,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""God and Mohammed prosper thee,"
6949,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""For thy sake and for ours!"""
6950,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6951,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"He tarried not,... he past"
6952,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The threshold, over which was no return."
6953,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"All earthly thoughts, all human hopes"
6954,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"And passions now put off,"
6955,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,He cast no backward glance
6956,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Towards the gleam of day.
6957,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"There was a light within,"
6958,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"A yellow light, as when the autumnal Sun"
6959,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Through travelling rain and mist
6960,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Shines on the evening hills.
6961,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Whether from central fires effused,"
6962,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Or if the sunbeams day by day,"
6963,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"From earliest generations, there absorbed,"
6964,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Were gathering for the wrath-flame. Shade was
6965,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,In those portentous vaults;
6966,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Crag overhanging, nor the column-rock"
6967,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Cast its dark outline there.
6968,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,For with the hot and heavy atmosphere
6969,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The light incorporate, permeating all,"
6970,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Spread over all its equal yellowness.
6971,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"There was no motion in the lifeless air,"
6972,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,He felt no stirring as he past
6973,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Adown the long descent,"
6974,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,He heard not his own footsteps on the rock
6975,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,That thro' the thick stagnation sent no sound.
6976,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"How sweet it were, he thought,"
6977,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,To feel the flowing wind!
6978,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,With what a thirst of joy
6979,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,He should breathe in the open gales of heaven!
6980,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6981,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Downward and downward still, and still the way,"
6982,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The long, long, way is safe."
6983,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Is there no secret wile
6984,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,No lurking enemy?
6985,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"His watchful eye is on the wall of rock,..."
6986,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And warily he marks the roof
6987,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And warily surveyed
6988,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The path that lay before.
6989,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Downward and downward still, and still the way,"
6990,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The long, long, way is safe;"
6991,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Rock only, the same light,"
6992,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The same dead atmosphere,"
6993,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"And solitude, and silence like the grave."
6994,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
6995,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,At length the long descent
6996,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Ends on a precipice;
6997,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"No feeble ray entered its dreadful gulphs,"
6998,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,For in the pit profound
6999,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Black Darkness, utter Night,"
7000,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Repelled the hostile gleam,"
7001,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And o'er the surface the light atmosphere
7002,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Floated and mingled not.
7003,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Above the depth four overawning wings,"
7004,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Unplumed and huge and strong,"
7005,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Bore up a little car;
7006,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Four living pinions, headless, bodyless,"
7007,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Sprung from one stem that branched below
7008,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"In four down-arching limbs,"
7009,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And clenched the car-rings endlong and aside
7010,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,With claws of griffin grasp.
7011,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
7012,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"But not on these, the depths so terrible,"
7013,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The wonderous wings, fixed Thalaba his eye,"
7014,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"For there upon the brink,"
7015,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"With fiery fetters fastened to the rock,"
7016,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"A man, a living man, tormented lay,"
7017,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The young Othatha; in the arms of love,"
7018,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,He who had lingered out the auspicious hour
7019,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Forgetful of his call.
7020,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,In shuddering pity Thalaba exclaimed
7021,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Servant of God, can I not succour thee?"""
7022,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"He groaned and answered, ""Son of Man,"
7023,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""I sinned and am tormented; I endure"
7024,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""In patience and in hope."
7025,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""The hour that shall destroy the Race of Hell,"
7026,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""That hour shall set me free."""
7027,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
7028,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Is it not come?"" quoth Thalaba,"
7029,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Yea! by this omen."" And with fearless hand"
7030,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"He grasped the burning fetters, ""in the name"
7031,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Of God!"" and from the rock"
7032,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Rooted the rivets, and adown the gulph"
7033,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Hurled them. The rush of flames roared up,"
7034,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,For they had kindled in their fall
7035,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The deadly vapours of the pit profound,"
7036,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,And Thalaba bent on and looked below.
7037,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,But vainly he explored
7038,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The deep abyss of flame
7039,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"That sunk beyond the plunge of mortal eye,"
7040,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Now all ablaze as if infernal fires
7041,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Illumed the world beneath.
7042,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Soon was the poison-fuel spent,"
7043,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"The flame grew pale and dim,"
7044,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"And dimmer now it fades and now is quenched,"
7045,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"And all again is dark,"
7046,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Save where the yellow air
7047,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Enters a little in and mingles slow.
7048,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
7049,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,Meantime the freed Othatha clasped his knees
7050,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"And cried, ""Deliverer!"" struggling then"
7051,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"With joyful hope, ""and where is she,"" he cried,"
7052,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Whose promised coming for so many a year...."""
7053,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Go!"" answered Thalaba,"
7054,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""She waits thee at the gates."""
7055,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""And in thy triumph,"" he replied,"
7056,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""There thou wilt join us?"" the Deliverer's eye"
7057,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"Glanced on the abyss, way else was none...."
7058,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,The depth was unascendable.
7059,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Await not me,"" he cried,"
7060,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""My path hath been appointed, go ... embark!"
7061,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,"""Return to life,... live happy!"""
7062,THE TWELFTH BOOK.,
7063,OTHATHA.,OTHATHA.
7064,OTHATHA.,
7065,OTHATHA.,"But thy name,..."
7066,OTHATHA.,"That thro' the nations we may blazon it,"
7067,OTHATHA.,That we may bless thee.
7068,OTHATHA.,
7069,THALABA.,THALABA.
7070,THALABA.,
7071,THALABA.,Bless the Merciful!
7072,THALABA.,
7073,THALABA.,Then Thalaba pronounced the name of God
7074,THALABA.,And leapt into the car.
7075,THALABA.,"Down, down, it sunk,... down down...."
7076,THALABA.,He neither breathes nor sees;
7077,THALABA.,His eyes are closed for giddiness
7078,THALABA.,His breath is sinking with the fall.
7079,THALABA.,The air that yields beneath the car
7080,THALABA.,Inflates the wings above.
7081,THALABA.,Down ... down ... a mighty depth!...
7082,THALABA.,And was the Simorgh with the Powers of ill
7083,THALABA.,Associate to destroy?
7084,THALABA.,And was that lovely mariner
7085,THALABA.,A fiend as false as fair?
7086,THALABA.,For still he sinks down ... down....
7087,THALABA.,But ever the uprushing wind
7088,THALABA.,"Inflates the wings above,"
7089,THALABA.,And still the struggling wings
7090,THALABA.,Repel the rushing wind.
7091,THALABA.,Down ... down ... and now it strikes.
7092,THALABA.,
7093,THALABA.,"He stands and totters giddily,"
7094,THALABA.,"All objects round, awhile,"
7095,THALABA.,Float dizzy on his sight.
7096,THALABA.,Collected soon he gazes for the way.
7097,THALABA.,There was a distant light that led his search;
7098,THALABA.,"The torch a broader blaze,"
7099,THALABA.,"The unpruned taper flames a longer flame,"
7100,THALABA.,"But this was fierce as is the noon-tide sun,"
7101,THALABA.,So in the glory of its rays intense
7102,THALABA.,It quivered with green glow.
7103,THALABA.,"Beyond was all unseen,"
7104,THALABA.,No eye could penetrate
7105,THALABA.,That unendurable excess of light.
7106,THALABA.,"It veiled no friendly form, thought Thalaba,"
7107,THALABA.,"And wisely did he deem,"
7108,THALABA.,"For at the threshold of the rocky door,"
7109,THALABA.,"Hugest and fiercest of his kind accurst,"
7110,THALABA.,Fit warden of the sorcery gate
7111,THALABA.,A rebel Afreet lay.
7112,THALABA.,He scented the approach of human food
7113,THALABA.,And hungry hope kindled his eye of flame.
7114,THALABA.,Raising his hand to save the dazzled sense
7115,THALABA.,"Onward held Thalaba,"
7116,THALABA.,And lifted still at times a rapid glance.
7117,THALABA.,"Till, the due distance gained,"
7118,THALABA.,"With head abased, he laid"
7119,THALABA.,The arrow in its rest.
7120,THALABA.,"With steady effort and knit forehead then,"
7121,THALABA.,Full on the painful light
7122,THALABA.,"He fixed his aching eye, and loosed the bow."
7123,THALABA.,
7124,THALABA.,"An anguish yell ensued,"
7125,THALABA.,And sure no human voice had scope or power
7126,THALABA.,For that prodigious shriek
7127,THALABA.,Whose pealing echoes thundered up the rock.
7128,THALABA.,"Dim grew the dying light,"
7129,THALABA.,But Thalaba leapt onward to the doors
7130,THALABA.,"Now visible beyond,"
7131,THALABA.,And while the Afreet warden of the way
7132,THALABA.,"Was writhing with his death-pangs, over him"
7133,THALABA.,"Sprung and smote the stony doors,"
7134,THALABA.,And bade them in the name of God give way.
7135,THALABA.,
7136,THALABA.,The dying Fiend beneath him at that name
7137,THALABA.,"Tossed in worse agony,"
7138,THALABA.,"And the rocks shuddered, and the rocky doors"
7139,THALABA.,Rent at the voice asunder. Lo ... within....
7140,THALABA.,"The Teraph and the fire,"
7141,THALABA.,"And Khawla, and in mail complete"
7142,THALABA.,Mohareb for the strife.
7143,THALABA.,But Thalaba with numbing force
7144,THALABA.,"Smites his raised arm, and rushes by,"
7145,THALABA.,For now he sees the fire amid whose flames
7146,THALABA.,On the white ashes of Hodeirah lies
7147,THALABA.,Hodeirah's holy Sword.
7148,THALABA.,
7149,THALABA.,"He rushes to the fire,"
7150,THALABA.,Then Khawla met the youth
7151,THALABA.,"And leapt upon him, and with clinging arms"
7152,THALABA.,"Clasps him, and calls Mohareb now to aim"
7153,THALABA.,The effectual vengeance. O fool! fool! he sees
7154,THALABA.,"His Father's Sword, and who shall bar his way?"
7155,THALABA.,Who stand against the fury of that arm
7156,THALABA.,That spurns her to the earth?
7157,THALABA.,"She rises half, she twists around his knees,"
7158,THALABA.,A moment ... and he vainly strives
7159,THALABA.,"To shake her from her hold,"
7160,THALABA.,Impatient then into her cursed breast
7161,THALABA.,"He stamps his crushing heel,"
7162,THALABA.,"And from her body, heaving now in death"
7163,THALABA.,Springs forward to the Sword.
7164,THALABA.,
7165,THALABA.,The co-existent flame
7166,THALABA.,"Knew the Destroyer; it encircled him,"
7167,THALABA.,"Rolled up his robe and gathered round his head,"
7168,THALABA.,"Condensing to intenser splendour there,"
7169,THALABA.,His crown of glory and his light of life
7170,THALABA.,Hovered the irradiate wreath.
7171,THALABA.,The moment Thalaba had laid his hand
7172,THALABA.,"Upon his Father's Sword,"
7173,THALABA.,The Living Image in the inner cave
7174,THALABA.,Smote the Round Altar. The Domdaniel rocked
7175,THALABA.,Thro' all its thundering vaults;
7176,THALABA.,Over the surface of the reeling Earth
7177,THALABA.,The alarum shock was felt:
7178,THALABA.,"The Sorcerer brood, all, all, where'er dispersed,"
7179,THALABA.,"Perforce obeyed the summons; all, they came"
7180,THALABA.,"Compelled by Hell and Heaven,"
7181,THALABA.,By Hell compelled to keep
7182,THALABA.,"Their baptism-covenant,"
7183,THALABA.,And with the union of their strength
7184,THALABA.,Oppose the common danger; forced by Heaven
7185,THALABA.,To share the common doom.
7186,THALABA.,
7187,THALABA.,Vain are all spells! the Destroyer
7188,THALABA.,Treads the Domdaniel floor.
7189,THALABA.,They crowd with human arms and human force
7190,THALABA.,To crush the single foe;
7191,THALABA.,Vain is all human force!
7192,THALABA.,"He wields his Father's Sword,"
7193,THALABA.,The vengeance of awakened Deity!
7194,THALABA.,"But chief on Thalaba Mohareb prest,"
7195,THALABA.,The language of the inspired Witch
7196,THALABA.,"Announced one fatal blow for both,"
7197,THALABA.,"And desperate of self-safety, yet he hoped"
7198,THALABA.,"To serve the cause of Eblis, and uphold"
7199,THALABA.,His empire true in death.
7200,THALABA.,
7201,THALABA.,Who shall withstand his way?
7202,THALABA.,Scattered before the sword of Thalaba
7203,THALABA.,The sorcerer throng recede
7204,THALABA.,And leave him space for combat. Wretched man
7205,THALABA.,What shall the helmet or the shield avail
7206,THALABA.,"Against Almighty anger! wretched man,"
7207,THALABA.,Too late Mohareb finds that he has chosen
7208,THALABA.,The evil part! he rears his shield
7209,THALABA.,"To meet the Arabian's sword,..."
7210,THALABA.,Under the edge of that fire-hardened steel
7211,THALABA.,The shield falls severed; his cold arm
7212,THALABA.,"Rings with the jarring blow,..."

7610,FOOTNOTES:,"[12] Concerning the Pyramids, ""I shall put down, says Greaves, that"
7611,FOOTNOTES:,which is confessed by the Arabian writers to be the most probable
7612,FOOTNOTES:,"relation, as is reported by Ibn Abd Alhokm, whose words out of the"
7613,FOOTNOTES:,"Arabick are these. ""The greatest part of chronologers agree, that he"
7614,FOOTNOTES:,"which built the Pyramids, was, Saurid Ibn Salhouk, King of Egypt, who"
7615,FOOTNOTES:,"lived three hundred years before the flood. The occasion of this was,"
7616,FOOTNOTES:,"because he saw in his sleep, that the whole earth was turned over with"
7617,FOOTNOTES:,"the inhabitants of it, the men lying upon their faces, and the stars"
7618,FOOTNOTES:,"falling down and striking one another, with a terrible noise; and being"
7619,FOOTNOTES:,"troubled, he concealed it. After this he saw the fixed stars falling to"
7620,FOOTNOTES:,"the earth, in the similitude of white fowl, and they snatched up men,"
7621,FOOTNOTES:,carrying them between two great mountains; and these mountains closed
7622,FOOTNOTES:,"upon them, and the shining stars were made dark. Awaking with great"
7623,FOOTNOTES:,"fear, he assembles the chief priests of all the provinces of Egypt, an"
7624,FOOTNOTES:,"hundred and thirty priests, the chief of them was called Aclimum."
7625,FOOTNOTES:,"Relating the whole matter to them, they took the altitude of the stars,"
7626,FOOTNOTES:,"and making their prognostication, foretold of a deluge. The King said,"
7627,FOOTNOTES:,"will it come to our country? they answered, yea, and will destroy it."
7628,FOOTNOTES:,"And there remained a certain number of years for to come, and he"
7629,FOOTNOTES:,"commanded in the mean space to build the Pyramids, and a vault to be"
7630,FOOTNOTES:,"made, into which the river Nilus entering should run into the countries"
7631,FOOTNOTES:,"of the west, and into the land Al-Said. And he filled them with"
7632,FOOTNOTES:,"_telesmes_,[b] and with strange things, and with riches and treasures"
7633,FOOTNOTES:,and the like. He engraved in them all things that were told him by wise
7634,FOOTNOTES:,"men, as also all profound sciences, the names of _alakakirs_,[c] the"
7635,FOOTNOTES:,"uses and hurts of them; the science of astrology and of arithmetick, and"
7636,FOOTNOTES:,"of geometry, and of physick. All this may be interpreted by him that"
7637,FOOTNOTES:,knows their characters and language. After he had given order for this
7638,FOOTNOTES:,"building, they cut out vast columns and wonderful stones. They fetch"
7639,FOOTNOTES:,"massy stones from the Æthopians, and made with these the foundation of"
7640,FOOTNOTES:,"the three Pyramids, fastening them together with lead and iron. They"
7641,FOOTNOTES:,"built the gates of them forty cubits under ground, and they made the"
7642,FOOTNOTES:,"height of the Pyramids one hundred royal cubits, which are fifty of ours"
7643,FOOTNOTES:,in these times; he also made each side of them an hundred royal cubits.
7644,FOOTNOTES:,The beginning of this building was in a fortunate horoscope. After that
7645,FOOTNOTES:,"he had finished it, he covered it with coloured satten from the top to"
7646,FOOTNOTES:,"the bottom; and he appointed a solemn festival, at which were present"
7647,FOOTNOTES:,all the inhabitants of his kingdom. Then he built in the western Pyramid
7648,FOOTNOTES:,"thirty treasures, filled with store of riches, and utensils, and with"
7649,FOOTNOTES:,"signatures made of precious stones, and with instruments of iron, and"
7650,FOOTNOTES:,"vessels of earth, and with arms that rust not, and with glass which"
7651,FOOTNOTES:,"might be bended and yet not broken, and with several kind of alakakirs,"
7652,FOOTNOTES:,"single and double, and with deadly poisons, and with other things"
7653,FOOTNOTES:,besides. He made also in the east Pyramid divers celestial spheres and
7654,FOOTNOTES:,"stars, and what they severally operate in their aspects, and the"
7655,FOOTNOTES:,"perfumes which are to be used to them, and the books which treat of"
7656,FOOTNOTES:,these matters. He also put in the coloured Pyramid the commentaries of
7657,FOOTNOTES:,"the Priests, in chests of black marble, and with every Priest a book, in"
7658,FOOTNOTES:,"which were the wonders of his profession, and of his actions, and of his"
7659,FOOTNOTES:,"nature, and what was done in his time, and what is, and what shall be,"
7660,FOOTNOTES:,from the beginning of time to the end of it. He placed in every Pyramid
7661,FOOTNOTES:,a treasurer. The treasurer of the westerly Pyramid was a statue of
7662,FOOTNOTES:,"marble stone, standing upright with a lance, and upon his head a serpent"
7663,FOOTNOTES:,"wreathed. He that came near it, and stood still, the serpent bit him of"
7664,FOOTNOTES:,"one side, and wreathing round about his throat and killing him, returned"
7665,FOOTNOTES:,"to his place. He made the treasurer of the east Pyramid, an idol of"
7666,FOOTNOTES:,"black agate, his eyes open and shining, sitting upon a throne with a"
7667,FOOTNOTES:,"lance; when any looked upon him, he heard of one side of him a voice,"
7668,FOOTNOTES:,"which took away his sense, so that he fell prostrate upon his face, and"
7669,FOOTNOTES:,ceased not till he died. He made the treasurer of the coloured Pyramid a
7670,FOOTNOTES:,"statue of stone, called _Albut_, sitting: he which looked towards it was"
7671,FOOTNOTES:,"drawn by the statue, till he stuck to it, and could not be separated"
7672,FOOTNOTES:,"from it, till such time as he died. The Coptites write in their books,"
7673,FOOTNOTES:,"that there is an inscription engraven upon them, the exposition of which"
7674,FOOTNOTES:,"in Arabick is this, _I_ KING SAURID _built the Pyramids in such and such"
7675,FOOTNOTES:,"a time, and finished them in six years: he that comes after me, and says"
7676,FOOTNOTES:,"that he is equal to me, let him destroy them in six hundred years; and"
7677,FOOTNOTES:,"yet it is known, that it is easier to pluck down, than to build up: I"
7678,FOOTNOTES:,"also covered them, when I had finished them, with satten; and let him"
7679,FOOTNOTES:,"cover them with mats._ After that ALMAMON the Calif entered Ægypt, and"
7680,FOOTNOTES:,"saw the Pyramids. He desired to know what was within, and therefore"
7681,FOOTNOTES:,would have them opened. They told him it could not possibly be done. He
7682,FOOTNOTES:,"replied I will have it certainly done. And that hole was opened for him,"
7683,FOOTNOTES:,"which stands open to this day, with fire and vinegar. Two smiths"
7684,FOOTNOTES:,"prepared and sharpened the iron and engines, which they forced in, and"
7685,FOOTNOTES:,there was a great expence in the opening of it. The thickness of the
7686,FOOTNOTES:,wall was found to be twenty cubits; and when they came to the end of the
7687,FOOTNOTES:,"wall, behind the place they had digged, there was an ewer of green"
7688,FOOTNOTES:,"emerald; in it were a thousand dinars very weighty, every dinar was an"
7689,FOOTNOTES:,"ounce of our ounces: they wondered at it, but knew not the meaning of"
7690,FOOTNOTES:,"it. Then ALMAMON said, cast up the account, how much hath been spent in"
7691,FOOTNOTES:,"making the entrance; they cast it up, and lo it was the same sum which"
7692,FOOTNOTES:,"they found, it neither exceeded nor was defective. Within they found a"
7693,FOOTNOTES:,"square well, in the square of it there were doors, every door opened"
7694,FOOTNOTES:,into a house (or vault) in which there were dead bodies wrapped up in
7695,FOOTNOTES:,"linen. They found towards the top of the Pyramid, a chamber, in which"
7696,FOOTNOTES:,"there was an hollow stone: in it was a statue of stone like a man, and"
7697,FOOTNOTES:,"within it a man, upon whom was a breast-plate of gold set with jewels;"
7698,FOOTNOTES:,"upon his breast was a sword of invaluable price, and at his head a"
7699,FOOTNOTES:,"carbuncle of the bigness of an egg, shining like the light of the day;"
7700,FOOTNOTES:,"and upon him were characters written with a pen, no man knows what they"
7701,FOOTNOTES:,"signify. After ALMAMON had opened it, men entered into it for many"

11138,FOOTNOTES:,
11139,FOOTNOTES:,"It is now about five years ago, that a certain _Heyduke_, an inhabitant"
11140,FOOTNOTES:,"of the village of _Medreiga_, whose name was Arnold Paul, was bruised to"
11141,FOOTNOTES:,"death by a hay-cart, which ran over him. Thirty days after his death, no"
11142,FOOTNOTES:,"less than four persons died suddenly, in that manner, wherein, according"
11143,FOOTNOTES:,"to the tradition of the country, those people generally die who are"
11144,FOOTNOTES:,"sucked by Vampires. Upon this a story was called to mind, that this"
11145,FOOTNOTES:,"_Arnold Paul_ had told in his life-time, viz: that at _Cossova_ on the"
11146,FOOTNOTES:,"Frontiers of the _Turkish Servia_, he had been tormented by a Vampire;"
11147,FOOTNOTES:,"(now the established opinion is that a person sucked by a Vampire,"
11148,FOOTNOTES:,"becomes a Vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.) But that he had found"
11149,FOOTNOTES:,"a way to rid himself of this evil, by eating some of the earth out of"
11150,FOOTNOTES:,"the Vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution"
11151,FOOTNOTES:,however did not hinder his becoming a Vampire; insomuch that his body
11152,FOOTNOTES:,"being taken up forty days after his death, all the marks of a notorious"
11153,FOOTNOTES:,"Vampire were found thereon. His complexion was fresh, his hair, nails"
11154,FOOTNOTES:,"and beard were grown; he was full of fluid blood, which ran from all"
11155,FOOTNOTES:,parts of his body upon his shroud. The _Hadnagy_ or _Bailiff_ of the
11156,FOOTNOTES:,"place, who was a person well acquainted with Vampirism, caused a sharp"
11157,FOOTNOTES:,"stake to be thrust, as the custom is, through the heart of _Arnold"
11158,FOOTNOTES:,"Paul_, and also quite through his body; whereupon he cried out"
11159,FOOTNOTES:,"dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head,"
11160,FOOTNOTES:,"burnt his body, and threw the ashes thereof into _Saave_. They took the"
11161,FOOTNOTES:,same measures with the bodies of those persons who had died of
11162,FOOTNOTES:,"Vampirism, for fear that they should fall to sucking in their turns."
11163,FOOTNOTES:,
11164,FOOTNOTES:,All these prudent steps did not hinder the same mischief from breaking
11165,FOOTNOTES:,"out again about five years afterwards, when several people in the same"
11166,FOOTNOTES:,"village died in a very odd manner. In the space of three months,"
11167,FOOTNOTES:,"seventeen persons of all ages and sexes died of Vampirism, some"
11168,FOOTNOTES:,"suddenly, and some after two or three days suffering. Amongst others"
11169,FOOTNOTES:,"there was one _Stanoska_, the daughter of a _Heyduke_ whose name was"
11170,FOOTNOTES:,"_Jovitzo_ who going to bed in perfect health, waked in the middle of the"
11171,FOOTNOTES:,"night, and making a terrible outcry, affirmed that the son of a certain"
11172,FOOTNOTES:,"_Heyduke_ whose name was _Millo_, and who had been dead about three"
11173,FOOTNOTES:,"weeks, had attempted to strangle her in her sleep. She continued from"
11174,FOOTNOTES:,"that time in a languishing condition, and in the space of three days"
11175,FOOTNOTES:,died. What this girl had said discovered the son of _Millo_ to be a
11176,FOOTNOTES:,Vampire. They took up the body and found him so in effect. The principal
11177,FOOTNOTES:,"persons of the place, particularly the Physician and Surgeons, began to"
11178,FOOTNOTES:,"examine very narrowly, how, in spite of all their precautions, Vampirism"
11179,FOOTNOTES:,"had again broke out in so terrible a manner. After a strict inquisition,"
11180,FOOTNOTES:,they found that the deceased _Arnold Paul_ had not only sucked the four
11181,FOOTNOTES:,"persons before mentioned, but likewise several beasts, of whom the new"
11182,FOOTNOTES:,"Vampires had eaten, particularly the son of _Millo_. Induced by these"
11183,FOOTNOTES:,"circumstances, they took a resolution, of digging up the bodies of all"
11184,FOOTNOTES:,"persons who had died within a certain time. They did so, and amongst"
11185,FOOTNOTES:,"forty bodies, there were found seventeen evidently Vampires. Through the"
11186,FOOTNOTES:,"hearts of these they drove stakes, cut off their heads, burnt the"
11187,FOOTNOTES:,"bodies, and threw the ashes into the river. All the informations we have"
11188,FOOTNOTES:,"been speaking of were taken in a legal way, and all the executions were"
11189,FOOTNOTES:,"so performed, as appears by certificates drawn up in full form, attested"
11190,FOOTNOTES:,"by several officers in the neighbouring garrisons, by the surgeons of"
11191,FOOTNOTES:,"several Regiments, and the principal inhabitants of the place. The"
11192,FOOTNOTES:,verbal process was sent towards the latter end of last _January_ to the
11193,FOOTNOTES:,"council of war at _Vienna_, who thereupon established a special"
11194,FOOTNOTES:,commission to examine into these facts. Those just now mentioned were
11195,FOOTNOTES:,"attested by the _Hadnagi Barriarer_, the principal _Heyduke_ of the"
11196,FOOTNOTES:,"village, as also by _Battuer_, first Lieutenant of Prince _Alexander_ of"
11197,FOOTNOTES:,"_Wirtemberg_, _Flickstenger_, surgeon major of the regiment of"
11198,FOOTNOTES:,"_Furstemberg_, three other surgeons of the same regiment, and several"
11199,FOOTNOTES:,other persons.
11200,FOOTNOTES:,
11201,FOOTNOTES:,A similar superstition prevails in Greece. The man whose story we are
11202,FOOTNOTES:,"going to relate, was a Peasant of Mycone, naturally ill natured and"
11203,FOOTNOTES:,"quarrelsome, this is a circumstance to be taken notice of in such cases."
11204,FOOTNOTES:,"He was murdered in the fields, nobody knew how, or by whom. Two days"
11205,FOOTNOTES:,"after his being buried in a Chapel in the town, it was noised about that"
11206,FOOTNOTES:,"he was seen to walk in the night with great haste, that he tumbled about"
11207,FOOTNOTES:,"people's goods, put out their lamps, griped them behind, and a thousand"
11208,FOOTNOTES:,other monkey tricks. At first the story was received with laughter; but
11209,FOOTNOTES:,the thing was looked upon to be serious when the better sort of people
11210,FOOTNOTES:,"began to complain of it; the Papas themselves gave credit to the fact,"
11211,FOOTNOTES:,"and no doubt had their reasons for so doing; masses must be said, to be"
11212,FOOTNOTES:,"sure: but for all this, the Peasant drove his old trade and heeded"
11213,FOOTNOTES:,nothing they could do. After divers meetings of the chief people of the
11214,FOOTNOTES:,"city, of priests, and monks, it was gravely concluded, that 'twas"
11215,FOOTNOTES:,necessary in consequence of some musty ceremonial to wait till nine days
11216,FOOTNOTES:,after the interment should be expired.
11217,FOOTNOTES:,
11218,FOOTNOTES:,On the tenth day they said one mass in the chapel where the body was
11219,FOOTNOTES:,"laid, in order to drive out the Demon which they imagined was got into"
11220,FOOTNOTES:,"it. After mass they took up the body, and got every thing ready for"
11221,FOOTNOTES:,"pulling out its heart. The butcher of the town, an old clumsy fellow,"
11222,FOOTNOTES:,"first opens the belly instead of the breast, he groped a long while"
11223,FOOTNOTES:,"among the entrails, but could not find what he looked for; at last"
11224,FOOTNOTES:,somebody told him he should cut up the Diaphragm. The heart was then
11225,FOOTNOTES:,"pulled out, to the admiration of all the spectators. In the mean time"
11226,FOOTNOTES:,the Corpse stunk so abominably that they were obliged to burn
11227,FOOTNOTES:,frankincense; but the smoke mixing with the exhalations from the carcass
11228,FOOTNOTES:,"increased the stink, and began to muddle the poor people's pericranies."
11229,FOOTNOTES:,"Their imagination, struck with the spectacle before them, grew full of"
11230,FOOTNOTES:,"visions. It came into their noddles, that a thick smoke came out of the"
11231,FOOTNOTES:,body; we durst not say 'twas the smoke of the incense. They were
11232,FOOTNOTES:,incessantly bawling out Vroucolacas in the chapel and place before it;
11233,FOOTNOTES:,this is the name they give to these pretended Redivivi. The noise
11234,FOOTNOTES:,"bellowed thro' the streets, and it seemed to be a name invented on"
11235,FOOTNOTES:,purpose to rend the roof of the chapel. Several there present averr'd
11236,FOOTNOTES:,that the wretches blood was extremely red; the Butcher swore the body
11237,FOOTNOTES:,"was still warm, whence they concluded that the Deceas'd was a very ill"
11238,FOOTNOTES:,"man for not being thoroughly dead, or in plain terms for suffering"
11239,FOOTNOTES:,himself to be re-animated by Old Nick; which is the notion they have of
11240,FOOTNOTES:,Vroucolacas. They then roar'd out that name in a stupendous manner. Just
11241,FOOTNOTES:,at this time came in a flock of people loudly protesting they plainly
11242,FOOTNOTES:,perceived the Body was not grown stiff when it was carried from the
11243,FOOTNOTES:,"fields to Church to be buried, and that consequently it was a true"

11245,FOOTNOTES:,
11246,FOOTNOTES:,"I don't doubt they would have sworn it did not stink, had not we been"
11247,FOOTNOTES:,"there; so mazed were the poor people with this disaster, and so"
11248,FOOTNOTES:,"infatuated with their notion of the Dead being re-animated. As for us,"
11249,FOOTNOTES:,"who were got as close to the corpse as we could, that we might be more"
11250,FOOTNOTES:,"exact in our observations, we were almost poisoned with the intolerable"
11251,FOOTNOTES:,stink that issued from it. When they asked us what we thought of this
11252,FOOTNOTES:,"body, we told them we believed it to be very thoroughly dead: but as we"
11253,FOOTNOTES:,"were willing to cure, or at least not to exasperate their prejudiced"
11254,FOOTNOTES:,"imaginations, we represented to them, that it was no wonder the butcher"
11255,FOOTNOTES:,should feel a little warmth when he groped among Entrails that were then
11256,FOOTNOTES:,"rotting, that it was no extraordinary thing for it to emit fumes, since"
11257,FOOTNOTES:,dung turned up will do the same; that as for the pretended redness of
11258,FOOTNOTES:,"the blood, it still appeared by the butcher's hands to be nothing but a"
11259,FOOTNOTES:,very stinking nasty smear.

11263,FOOTNOTES:,did not make him a bit more tractable; he went on with his racket more
11264,FOOTNOTES:,"furiously than ever; he was accused of beating folks in the night,"

11270,FOOTNOTES:,wisest among them were stricken like the rest; 'twas an epidemical
11271,FOOTNOTES:,"disease of the brain, as dangerous and infectious as the madness of"

11273,FOOTNOTES:,"from the farthest parts of the town into the public place, there to"

11282,FOOTNOTES:,"doubted the truth of the fact, came and upbraided us with our"

12504,FOOTNOTES:,"went out, and diligently enquiring found a single one in the possession"
