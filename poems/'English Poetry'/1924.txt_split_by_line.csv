117,THE RETURN,
118,THE RETURN,
119,THE RETURN,"THE grass was gray with the moonlit dew,"
120,THE RETURN,The stones were white as I came through;
121,THE RETURN,"I came down the path by the thirteen yews,"
122,THE RETURN,Through the blocks of shade that the moonlight hews.
123,THE RETURN,And when I came to the high lych-gate
124,THE RETURN,I waited awhile where the corpses wait;
125,THE RETURN,Then I came down the road where the moonlight lay
126,THE RETURN,Like the fallen ghost of the light of day.
127,THE RETURN,
128,THE RETURN,"The bats shrieked high in their zigzag flight,"
129,THE RETURN,"The owls’ spread wings were quiet and white,"
130,THE RETURN,"The wind and the poplar gave sigh for sigh,"
131,THE RETURN,And all about were the rustling shy
132,THE RETURN,Little live creatures that love the night—
133,THE RETURN,Little wild creatures timid and free.
134,THE RETURN,"I passed, and they were not afraid of me."
135,THE RETURN,
136,THE RETURN,It was over the meadow and down the lane
137,THE RETURN,The way to come to my house again:
138,THE RETURN,"Through the wood where the lovers talk,"
139,THE RETURN,"And the ghosts, they say, get leave to walk."
140,THE RETURN,"I wore the clothes that we all must wear,"
141,THE RETURN,"And no one saw me walking there,"
142,THE RETURN,No one saw my pale feet pass
143,THE RETURN,By my garden path to my garden grass.
144,THE RETURN,My garden was hung with the veil of spring—
145,THE RETURN,Plum-tree and pear-tree blossoming;
146,THE RETURN,It lay in the moon’s cold sheet of light
147,THE RETURN,"In garlands and silence, wondrous and white"
148,THE RETURN,As a dead bride decked for her burying.
149,THE RETURN,
150,THE RETURN,Then I saw the face of my house
151,THE RETURN,Held close in the arms of the blossomed boughs:
152,THE RETURN,I leaned my face to the window bright
153,THE RETURN,To feel if the heart of my house beat right.
154,THE RETURN,The firelight hung it with fitful gold;
155,THE RETURN,It was warm as the house of the dead is cold.
156,THE RETURN,"I saw the settles, the candles tall,"
157,THE RETURN,"The black-faced presses against the wall,"
158,THE RETURN,"Polished beechwood and shining brass,"
159,THE RETURN,"The gleam of china, the glitter of glass,"
160,THE RETURN,All the little things that were home to me—
161,THE RETURN,Everything as it used to be.
162,THE RETURN,
163,THE RETURN,"Then I said, “The fire of life still burns,"
164,THE RETURN,And I have returned whence none returns:
165,THE RETURN,"I will warm my hands where the fire is lit,"
166,THE RETURN,I will warm my heart in the heart of it!”
167,THE RETURN,So I called aloud to the one within:
168,THE RETURN,"“Open, open, and let me in!"
169,THE RETURN,Let me in to the fire and the light—
170,THE RETURN,It is very cold out here in the night!”
171,THE RETURN,There was never a stir or an answering breath—
172,THE RETURN,Only a silence as deep as death.
173,THE RETURN,
174,THE RETURN,"Then I beat on the window, and called, and cried."
175,THE RETURN,"No one heard me, and none replied."
176,THE RETURN,"The golden silence lay warm and deep,"
177,THE RETURN,"And I wept as the dead, forgotten, weep;"
178,THE RETURN,And there was no one to hear or see—
179,THE RETURN,"To comfort me, to have pity on me."
180,THE RETURN,
181,THE RETURN,But deep in the silence something stirred—
182,THE RETURN,Something that had not seen or heard—
183,THE RETURN,"And two drew near to the window-pane,"
184,THE RETURN,"Kissed in the moonlight and kissed again,"
185,THE RETURN,"And looked, through my face, to the moon-shroud, spread"
186,THE RETURN,Over the garlanded garden bed;
187,THE RETURN,And—“How ghostly the moonlight is!” she said.
188,THE RETURN,
189,THE RETURN,"Back through the garden, the wood, the lane,"
190,THE RETURN,I came to mine own place again.
191,THE RETURN,"I wore the garments we all must wear,"
192,THE RETURN,And no one saw me walking there.
193,THE RETURN,No one heard my thin feet pass
194,THE RETURN,"Through the white of the stones and the gray of the grass,"
195,THE RETURN,Along the path where the moonlight hews
196,THE RETURN,Slabs of shadow for thirteen yews.
197,THE RETURN,
198,THE RETURN,In the hollow where drifted dreams lie deep
199,THE RETURN,It is good to sleep: it was good to sleep:
200,THE RETURN,"But my bed has grown cold with the drip of the dew,"
201,THE RETURN,And I cannot sleep as I used to do.

281,THE DAISIES,There are neat little beds of geraniums and fuchsia
282,THE DAISIES,With never a happy weed between.
283,THE DAISIES,"There’s a neat little grass plot, bald in places,"
284,THE DAISIES,And very dusty to touch;
285,THE DAISIES,A respectable man comes once a week
286,THE DAISIES,"To keep the garden weeded and swept,"
287,THE DAISIES,To keep it as we don’t want it kept.
288,THE DAISIES,"He cuts the grass with his mowing-machine,"
289,THE DAISIES,And we think he cuts it too much.
290,THE DAISIES,"But even on the lawn, all dry and gritty,"
291,THE DAISIES,The daisies play about.
292,THE DAISIES,"They are so brave as well as so pretty,"
293,THE DAISIES,You cannot keep them out.
294,THE DAISIES,"I love them, I want to let them grow,"
295,THE DAISIES,But that respectable man says no.
296,THE DAISIES,He cuts off their heads with his mowing-machine
297,THE DAISIES,Like the French Revolution guillotine.
298,THE DAISIES,"He sweeps up the poor little pretty faces,"
299,THE DAISIES,The dear little white-frilled daisy faces;
300,THE DAISIES,Says things must be kept in their proper places
301,THE DAISIES,He has no frill round his ugly face—
302,THE DAISIES,I wish I could find his proper place!

311,THE TOUCHSTONE,With all the roses summer never brings.
312,THE TOUCHSTONE,The snowy blossom of immortal Springs
313,THE TOUCHSTONE,"Lighted its boughs, and I, even I, was there."
314,THE TOUCHSTONE,"There were new heavens, and the earth was new,"
315,THE TOUCHSTONE,And still I told my heart the dream was true.
316,THE TOUCHSTONE,
317,THE TOUCHSTONE,"But when the sun stood still, and Time went out"
318,THE TOUCHSTONE,Like a blown candle—when she came to me
319,THE TOUCHSTONE,"Under the bride-veil of the blossomed tree,"
320,THE TOUCHSTONE,"Chill through the garden blew the winds of doubt,"
321,THE TOUCHSTONE,"And when, with starry eyes, and lips too near,"
322,THE TOUCHSTONE,"She leaned to me, my heart knew what to fear."
323,THE TOUCHSTONE,
324,THE TOUCHSTONE,"“It is no dream,” she said.  “What dream had stayed"
325,THE TOUCHSTONE,So long?  It is the blessed isle that lies
326,THE TOUCHSTONE,Between the tides of twin eternities.
327,THE TOUCHSTONE,It is our island; do not be afraid!”
328,THE TOUCHSTONE,"Then, then at last my heart was well deceived;"
329,THE TOUCHSTONE,I hid my eyes; I trembled and believed.
330,THE TOUCHSTONE,
331,THE TOUCHSTONE,"Her real presence sanctified my faith,"
332,THE TOUCHSTONE,"Her very voice my restless fears beguiled,"
333,THE TOUCHSTONE,"And it was Life that clasped me when she smiled,"
334,THE TOUCHSTONE,But when she said “I love you!” it was Death.

368,THE FIRE,"I love you hot as fire, my girl, and you know you know it too."
369,THE FIRE,So won’t you name the day?”
370,THE FIRE,"But I said, “That I will not.”"
371,THE FIRE,"And I pushed him away,"
372,THE FIRE,Out among the raspberries all on a summer day.
373,THE FIRE,"And I says, “You ask in winter, if your love’s so hot,"
374,THE FIRE,"For it’s summer now, and sunny, and my hands is full,” says I,"

397,THE FIRE,
398,THE FIRE,"The hay was stacked, the fruit was picked, the hops were dry and"

400,THE FIRE,"And everything was garnered, and the year turned upside down,"
401,THE FIRE,"And the winter it come on, and the fires were early lit,"
402,THE FIRE,"And he’d never come anigh again, and all my life was sick."
403,THE FIRE,"And I was cold alone, with nought to do but sit"
404,THE FIRE,"With my hands in my black lap, and hear the clock tick."
405,THE FIRE,"For father, he lay dead"
406,THE FIRE,"With the candles at his head,"
407,THE FIRE,And his coffin was that black I could see it through the wall;
408,THE FIRE,"And I’d sent them all away,"
409,THE FIRE,Though they’d offered for to stay.
410,THE FIRE,"I wanted to be cold alone, and learn to bear it all."
411,THE FIRE,Then I heard him.  I’d a-known it for his footstep just as plain
412,THE FIRE,If he’d brought his regiment with him up the rutty frozen lane.
413,THE FIRE,"And I hadn’t drawed the curtains, and I see him through the pane;"
414,THE FIRE,And I jumped up in my blacks and I threw the door back wide.
415,THE FIRE,"Says I, “You come inside;"
416,THE FIRE,"For it’s cold outside for you,"
417,THE FIRE,And it’s cold here too;

422,THE FIRE,
423,THE FIRE,Then I saw in his face
424,THE FIRE,"The fear of death, and desire."
425,THE FIRE,"And oh, I took and kissed him again and again,"
426,THE FIRE,"And I clipped him close and all,"
427,THE FIRE,"In the winter, in the dusk, in the quiet house-place,"
428,THE FIRE,With the coffin lying black and full the other side the wall;
429,THE FIRE,"And “_You_ warm my heart,” I told him, “if there’s any fire in men!”"
430,THE FIRE,"And he got his two arms round me, and I felt the fire then."

735,THE SKYLARK,"Love of my life, bear witness here"
736,THE SKYLARK,How we have heard them all the year;
737,THE SKYLARK,How to the skylark’s song are set
738,THE SKYLARK,The days we never can forget.
739,THE SKYLARK,"At Rustington, do you remember?"
740,THE SKYLARK,We heard the skylarks in December;
741,THE SKYLARK,In January above the snow
742,THE SKYLARK,They sang to us by Hurstmonceux
743,THE SKYLARK,Once in the keenest airs of March
744,THE SKYLARK,We heard them near the Marble Arch;
745,THE SKYLARK,Their April song thrilled Tonbridge air;
746,THE SKYLARK,May found them singing everywhere;
747,THE SKYLARK,"And oh, in Sheppey, how their tune"
748,THE SKYLARK,Rhymed with the bean-flower scent in June.
749,THE SKYLARK,One unforgotten day at Rye
750,THE SKYLARK,They sang a love-song in July;
751,THE SKYLARK,"In August, hard by Lewes town,"
752,THE SKYLARK,They sang of joy ’twixt sky and down;
753,THE SKYLARK,And in September’s golden spell
754,THE SKYLARK,We heard them singing on Scaw Fell.
755,THE SKYLARK,"October’s leaves were brown and sere,"
756,THE SKYLARK,But skylarks sang by Teston Weir;
757,THE SKYLARK,"And in November, at Mount’s Bay,"
758,THE SKYLARK,They sang upon our wedding day!
759,THE SKYLARK,
760,THE SKYLARK,. . . . .
761,THE SKYLARK,
762,THE SKYLARK,"Mr.-à-Field, go forth, go forth,"

764,THE SKYLARK,"You’ll always find the furze in flower,"
765,THE SKYLARK,"Find every hour the lovers’ hour,"
766,THE SKYLARK,"And, by my faith in love and rhyme,"
767,THE SKYLARK,The skylark singing all the time!

785,SATURDAY SONG,I’ve heard of bazaars in India
786,SATURDAY SONG,"All glitter and spices and smells,"
787,SATURDAY SONG,But they don’t compare
788,SATURDAY SONG,With the naphtha flare
789,SATURDAY SONG,And the herrings the coster sells;
790,SATURDAY SONG,"And the oranges piled like gold,"
791,SATURDAY SONG,"The cucumbers lean and cold,"
792,SATURDAY SONG,And the red and white block-trimmings
793,SATURDAY SONG,"And the strawberries fresh and ripe,"

802,SATURDAY SONG,"And your girl has her arm in yours,"
803,SATURDAY SONG,And you whisper and make her blush.
804,SATURDAY SONG,Oh! the snap in her eyes—and her smiles and her sighs
805,SATURDAY SONG,As she fancies the purple plush!
806,SATURDAY SONG,
807,SATURDAY SONG,"And you haven’t a penny to spend,"
808,SATURDAY SONG,But you dream that you’ve pounds and pounds;
809,SATURDAY SONG,And arm in arm with your only friend
810,SATURDAY SONG,You make your Saturday rounds:
811,SATURDAY SONG,And you see the cradle bright
812,SATURDAY SONG,With ribbon—lace—pink and white;
813,SATURDAY SONG,And she stops her laugh
814,SATURDAY SONG,And you drop your chaff
815,SATURDAY SONG,In the light of the Saturday night.
816,SATURDAY SONG,And the world is new
817,SATURDAY SONG,For her and you—
818,SATURDAY SONG,A little bit of all-right.

826,THE CHAMPION,"YOUNG and a conqueror, once on a day,"
827,THE CHAMPION,Wild white Winter rode out this way;
828,THE CHAMPION,With his sword of ice and his banner of snow
829,THE CHAMPION,Vanquished the Summer and laid her low.
830,THE CHAMPION,
831,THE CHAMPION,"Winter was young then, young and strong;"
832,THE CHAMPION,"Now he is old, he has reigned too long."
833,THE CHAMPION,"He shall be routed, he shall be slain;"

837,THE CHAMPION,Little armies in field and brake:
838,THE CHAMPION,“Cruel and cold has King Winter been;
839,THE CHAMPION,"Fight for the Summer, fight for the Queen!”"
840,THE CHAMPION,
841,THE CHAMPION,First the aconite dots the mould
842,THE CHAMPION,With little round cannon-balls of gold;
843,THE CHAMPION,"Then, to help in the winter’s rout,"
844,THE CHAMPION,Regiments of crocuses march out.
845,THE CHAMPION,
846,THE CHAMPION,See the swords of the flag-leaves shine;
847,THE CHAMPION,"See the shield of the celandine,"
848,THE CHAMPION,"And daffodil lances green and keen,"
849,THE CHAMPION,"To fight for the Summer, fight for the Queen."
850,THE CHAMPION,
851,THE CHAMPION,Silver triumphant the snowdrop swings
852,THE CHAMPION,Banners that mock at defeated kings;
853,THE CHAMPION,"And wherever the green of the new grass peers,"
854,THE CHAMPION,See the array of victorious spears.
855,THE CHAMPION,
856,THE CHAMPION,Daffodil trumpets soon shall sound
857,THE CHAMPION,"Over the garden’s battle-ground,"

865,THE CHAMPION,
866,THE CHAMPION,Hundreds of milkmaids by field and fold;
867,THE CHAMPION,Thousands of buttercups licked with gold;
868,THE CHAMPION,Budding hedges and woods and trees—
869,THE CHAMPION,Spring brings freedom and life to these.
870,THE CHAMPION,
871,THE CHAMPION,Then the triumphant Spring shall ride
872,THE CHAMPION,Over the happy countryside;
873,THE CHAMPION,Deep in the woods the birds shall sing:
874,THE CHAMPION,“The King is dead—long live the King!”
875,THE CHAMPION,
876,THE CHAMPION,"But Spring is no king, but a faithful knight;"
877,THE CHAMPION,He will ride on through the meadows bright
878,THE CHAMPION,Till at Summer’s feet he shall light him down
879,THE CHAMPION,And lay at her feet the royal crown.
880,THE CHAMPION,
881,THE CHAMPION,She will lean down where the roses twine
882,THE CHAMPION,"Between the may-trees’ silver shine,"
883,THE CHAMPION,And look in the eyes of the dying knight
884,THE CHAMPION,Who led his army and won her fight.
885,THE CHAMPION,
886,THE CHAMPION,"She will stoop to his lips and say,"
887,THE CHAMPION,"“Oh, live, O love!  O my true love, stay!”"
888,THE CHAMPION,While he smiles and sighs her arms between
889,THE CHAMPION,"And dies for the Summer, dies for the Queen."

1725,I,WHEN I lived in the village of youth
1726,I,"There were lilies in all the orchards,"
1727,I,Flowers in the orange-gardens
1728,I,For brides to wear in their hair.
1729,I,"It was always sunshine and summer,"
1730,I,"Roses at every lattice,"
1731,I,"Dreams in the eyes of maidens,"
1732,I,Love in the eyes of men.
1733,I,
1734,I,When I lived in the village of youth
1735,I,"The doors, all the doors, stood open;"
1736,I,"We went in and out of them laughing,"
1737,I,Laughing and calling each other
1738,I,"To shew each other our fairings,"
1739,I,"The new shawl, the new comb, the new fan,"
1740,I,"The new rose, the new lover."
1741,I,
1742,I,Now I live in the town of age
1743,I,"Where are no orchards, no gardens."
1744,I,"Here, too, all the doors stand open,"
1745,I,But no one goes in or goes out.
1746,I,We sit alone by the hearthstone
1747,I,Where memories lie like ashes
1748,I,Upon a hearth that is cold;
1749,I,
1750,I,And they from the village of youth
1751,I,"Run by our doorsteps laughing,"
1752,I,"Calling, to shew each other"
1753,I,"The new shawl, the new comb, the new fan,"
1754,I,"The new rose, the new lover."
1755,I,
1756,I,Once we had all these things—
1757,I,"We kept them from the old people,"
1758,I,And now the young people have them
1759,I,And will not shew them to us—
1760,I,To us who are old and have nothing
1761,I,"But the white, still, heaped-up ashes"
1762,I,On the hearth where the fire went out
1763,I,A very long time ago.

1769,II,
1770,II,I HAD a mistress; I loved her.
1771,II,"She left me with memories bitter,"
1772,II,"Corroding, eating my heart"
1773,II,As the acid eats into the steel
1774,II,Etching the portrait triumphant.
1775,II,"Intolerable, indelible,"
1776,II,Never to be effaced.
1777,II,
1778,II,"A wife was mine to my heart,"
1779,II,"Beautiful flower of my garden,"
1780,II,"Lily I worshipped by day,"
1781,II,Scented rose of my nights.
1782,II,Now the night wind sighing
1783,II,Blows white rose petals only
1784,II,Over the bed where she sleeps
1785,II,Dreamless alone.
1786,II,
1787,II,I had a son; I loved him.
1788,II,"Mother of God, bear witness"
1789,II,How all my manhood loved him
1790,II,As thy womanhood loved thy Son!
1791,II,When he was grown to his manhood
1792,II,"He crucified my heart,"
1793,II,And even as it hung bleeding
1794,II,"He laughed with his bold companions,"
1795,II,Mocked and turned away
1796,II,With laughter into the night.
1797,II,
1798,II,Those three I loved and lost;
1799,II,But there was one who loved me
1800,II,With all the fire of her heart.
1801,II,Mine was the sacred altar
1802,II,Where she burnt her life for my worship.
1803,II,"She was my slave, my servant;"
1804,II,"Mine all she had, all she was,"
1805,II,"All she could suffer, could be."
1806,II,"That was the love of my life,"
1807,II,"I did not say, “She loves me”;"
1808,II,I was so used to her love
1809,II,"I never asked its name,"
1810,II,"Till, feeling the wind blow cold"
1811,II,"Where all the doors were left open,"
1812,II,And seeing a fireless hearth
1813,II,And the garden deserted and weed-grown
1814,II,"That once was full of flowers for me,"
1815,II,"I said, “What has changed?  What is it"
1816,II,That has made all the clocks stop?”
1817,II,Thus I asked and they answered:
1818,II,“It is thy mother who is dead.”
1819,II,
1820,II,And now I am alone.
1821,II,"My son, too, some day will stand"
1822,II,"Here, where I stand and weep."
1823,II,"He too will weep, knowing too late"
1824,II,The love that wrapped round his life.
1825,II,Dear God spare him this:
1826,II,"Let him never know how I loved him,"
1827,II,For he was always weak.
1828,II,He could not endure as I can.
1829,II,"Mother, my dear, ask God"
1830,II,"To grant me this, for my son!"
