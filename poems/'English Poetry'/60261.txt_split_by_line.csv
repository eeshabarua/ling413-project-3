701,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),our ken’;
702,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Till ye made a sport of your shrunken hosts and a toy of your armed
703,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),men.
704,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Ye stopped your ears to the warning--ye would neither look nor heed--
705,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Ye set your leisure before their toil and your lusts above their
706,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),need.
707,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Because of your witless learning and your beasts of warren and chase,"
708,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Ye grudged your sons to their service and your fields for their

710,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Ye forced them glean in the highways the straw for the bricks they
711,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),brought;
712,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Ye forced them follow in byways the craft that ye never taught.
713,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Ye hindered and hampered and crippled; ye thrust out of sight and
714,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),away
715,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Those that would serve you for honour and those that served you for

722,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Sons of the sheltered city--unmade, unhandled, unmeet--"
723,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Ye pushed them raw to the battle as ye picked them raw from the

726,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"breath,"

734,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Ere--ye fawned on the Younger Nations for the men who could shoot and
735,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),ride!
736,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Then ye returned to your trinkets; then ye contented your souls

739,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Given to strong delusion, wholly believing a lie,"

742,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Idle--openly idle--in the lee of the forespent Line.
743,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Idle--except for your boasting--and what is your boasting worth

755,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"As it were almost cricket--as it were even your play,"
756,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Weighed and pondered and worshipped, and practised day and day."

758,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"In the womb of the blotting war-cloud, and the pallid nations quake."
759,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"So, at the haggard trumpets, instant your soul shall leap"
760,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Forthright, accoutred, accepting--alert from the wells of sleep."
761,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),So at the threat ye shall summon--so at the need ye shall send
762,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Men, not children or servants, tempered and taught to the end;"
763,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Cleansed of servile panic, slow to dread or despise,"
764,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Humble because of knowledge, mighty by sacrifice."
765,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"But ye say, ‘It will mar our comfort.’ Ye say, ‘It will minish our"

772,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Will the rabbit war with your foemen--the red deer horn them for hire?
773,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Your kept cock-pheasant keep you?--he is master of many a shire.
774,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Arid, aloof, incurious, unthinking, unthanking, gelt,"
775,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Will ye loose your schools to flout them till their brow-beat columns
776,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),melt?
777,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Will ye pray them or preach them, or print them, or ballot them back"
778,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),from your shore?
779,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Will your workmen issue a mandate to bid them strike no more?
780,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Will ye rise and dethrone your rulers? (Because ye were idle both?
781,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Pride by insolence chastened? Indolence purged by sloth?)
782,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),No doubt but ye are the People; who shall make you afraid?
783,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Also your gods are many; no doubt but your gods shall aid.
784,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Idols of greasy altars built for the body’s ease;

808,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),The Word came down to Dives in Torment where he lay:
809,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"‘Our World is full of wickedness, My Children maim and slay,"
810,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘And the Saint and Seer and Prophet
811,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘Can make no better of it

813,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
814,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"‘Rise up, rise up, thou Dives, and take again thy gold,"
815,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘And thy women and thy housen as they were to thee of old.
816,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘It may be grace hath found thee

818,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘And that thou shalt bring the peace My Son foretold.’
819,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
820,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Then merrily rose Dives and leaped from out his fire,"
821,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And walked abroad with diligence to do the Lord’s desire;
822,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"And anon the battles ceased,"
823,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"And the captives were released,"
824,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And Earth had rest from Goshen to Gadire.
825,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
826,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"The Word came down to Satan that raged and roared alone,"
827,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),’Mid the shouting of the peoples by the cannon overthrown
828,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"(But the Prophets, Saints, and Seers"
829,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Set each other by the ears,"

831,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
832,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"‘Rise up, rise up, thou Satan, upon the Earth to go,"
833,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘And prove the peace of Dives if it be good or no:
834,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘For all that he hath planned
835,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"‘We deliver to thy hand,"
836,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘As thy skill shall serve to break it or bring low.’
837,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
838,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Then mightily rose Satan, and about the Earth he hied,"
839,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And breathed on Kings in idleness and Princes drunk with pride;
840,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),But for all the wrong he breathed
841,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"There was never sword unsheathed,"
842,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And the fires he lighted flickered out and died.
843,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
844,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Then terribly rose Satan, and he darkened Earth afar,"
845,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Till he came on cunning Dives where the money-changers are;
846,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And he saw men pledge their gear
847,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"For the gold that buys the spear,"
848,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And the helmet and the habergeon of war.
849,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
850,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Yea to Dives came the Persian and the Syrian and the Mede--
851,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"And their hearts were nothing altered, nor their cunning nor their"
852,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),greed--
853,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And they pledged their flocks and farms
854,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"For the king-compelling arms,"
855,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And Dives lent according to their need.
856,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
857,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"Then Satan said to Dives:--’Return again with me,"
858,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"‘Who hast broken His Commandment in the day He set thee free,"
859,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"‘Who grindest for thy greed,"
860,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘Man’s belly-pinch and need;
861,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘And the blood of Man to filthy usury!’
862,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
863,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Then softly answered Dives where the money-changers sit:--
864,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"‘My refuge is Our Master, O My Master in the Pit;"
865,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),‘But behold all Earth is laid

870,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"To shake the new-sown peoples with insult, doubt, and dread;"
871,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),But for all the sleight he used
872,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),"There was never squadron loosed,"
873,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And the brands he flung flew dying and fell dead.
874,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),
875,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),Yet to Dives came Atlantis and the Captains of the West--
876,(THE SUB-EDITOR SPEAKS),And their hates were nothing weakened nor their anger nor unrest--
