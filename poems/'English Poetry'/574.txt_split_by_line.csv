37,INTRODUCTION,"Piping down the valleys wild,"

39,INTRODUCTION,"On a cloud I saw a child,"
40,INTRODUCTION,And he laughing said to me:

58,INTRODUCTION,"And I stain'd the water clear,"
59,INTRODUCTION,And I wrote my happy songs
60,INTRODUCTION,Every child may joy to hear.

63,THE SHEPHERD,THE SHEPHERD
64,THE SHEPHERD,
65,THE SHEPHERD,How sweet is the Shepherd's sweet lot!
66,THE SHEPHERD,From the morn to the evening he stays;
67,THE SHEPHERD,"He shall follow his sheep all the day,"
68,THE SHEPHERD,And his tongue shall be filled with praise.
69,THE SHEPHERD,
70,THE SHEPHERD,"For he hears the lambs' innocent call,"
71,THE SHEPHERD,And he hears the ewes' tender reply;
72,THE SHEPHERD,"He is watching while they are in peace,"
73,THE SHEPHERD,For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.

77,THE ECHOING GREEN,
78,THE ECHOING GREEN,"The sun does arise,"
79,THE ECHOING GREEN,And make happy the skies;
80,THE ECHOING GREEN,The merry bells ring
81,THE ECHOING GREEN,To welcome the Spring;
82,THE ECHOING GREEN,"The skylark and thrush,"
83,THE ECHOING GREEN,"The birds of the bush,"
84,THE ECHOING GREEN,Sing louder around
85,THE ECHOING GREEN,To the bells' cheerful sound;
86,THE ECHOING GREEN,While our sports shall be seen
87,THE ECHOING GREEN,On the echoing Green.
88,THE ECHOING GREEN,
89,THE ECHOING GREEN,"Old John, with white hair,"
90,THE ECHOING GREEN,"Does laugh away care,"
91,THE ECHOING GREEN,"Sitting under the oak,"
92,THE ECHOING GREEN,Among the old folk.
93,THE ECHOING GREEN,"They laugh at our play,"
94,THE ECHOING GREEN,"And soon they all say,"
95,THE ECHOING GREEN,"""Such, such were the joys"
96,THE ECHOING GREEN,When we all--girls and boys--
97,THE ECHOING GREEN,In our youth-time were seen
98,THE ECHOING GREEN,"On the echoing Green."""
99,THE ECHOING GREEN,
100,THE ECHOING GREEN,"Till the little ones, weary,"
101,THE ECHOING GREEN,No more can be merry:
102,THE ECHOING GREEN,"The sun does descend,"
103,THE ECHOING GREEN,And our sports have an end.
104,THE ECHOING GREEN,Round the laps of their mothers
105,THE ECHOING GREEN,"Many sisters and brothers,"
106,THE ECHOING GREEN,"Like birds in their nest,"
107,THE ECHOING GREEN,"Are ready for rest,"
108,THE ECHOING GREEN,And sport no more seen
109,THE ECHOING GREEN,On the darkening green.

139,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"My mother bore me in the southern wild,"
140,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"And I  am black, but oh my soul is white!"
141,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"White as an angel is the English child,"
142,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"But I am black, as if bereaved of light."
143,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,
144,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"My mother taught me underneath a tree,"
145,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"And, sitting down before the heat of day,"
146,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"She took me on her lap and kissed me,"
147,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"And, pointed to the east, began to say:"
148,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,
149,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"""Look on the rising sun: there God does live,"
150,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"And gives His light, and gives His heat away,"
151,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive
152,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday."
153,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,
154,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"""And we are put on earth a little space,"
155,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,That we may learn to bear the beams of love
156,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,And these black bodies and this sunburnt face
157,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove."
158,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,
159,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"""For when our souls have learn'd the heat to bear,"
160,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,"
161,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"Saying, 'Come out from the grove, my love and care"
162,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice',"""
163,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,
164,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"Thus did my mother say, and kissed me;"
165,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,And thus I say to little English boy.
166,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"When I from black and he from white cloud free,"
167,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,And round the tent of God like lambs we joy
168,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,
169,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,I'll shade him from the heat till he can bear
170,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,To lean in joy upon our Father's knee;
171,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,"
172,THE LITTLE BLACK BOY,"And be like him, and he will then love me."

179,THE BLOSSOM,A happy blossom
180,THE BLOSSOM,"Sees you, swift as arrow,"
181,THE BLOSSOM,"Seek your cradle narrow,"
182,THE BLOSSOM,Near my bosom.
183,THE BLOSSOM,"Pretty, pretty robin!"

191,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER
192,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,
193,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"When my mother died I was very young,"
194,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,And my father sold me while yet my tongue
195,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"Could scarcely cry ""Weep! weep! weep! weep!"""
196,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep."
197,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,
198,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,"
199,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved; so I said,"
200,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"""Hush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your head's bare,"
201,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."""
202,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,
203,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"And so he was quiet, and that very night,"
204,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!--"
205,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,"
206,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.
207,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,
208,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"And by came an angel, who had a bright key,"
209,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"And he opened the coffins, and let them all free;"
210,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run,"
211,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"And wash in a river, and shine in the sun."
212,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,
213,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,"
214,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind;"
215,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,"
216,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"He'd have God for his father, and never want joy."
217,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,
218,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,"
219,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,And got with our bags and our brushes to work.
220,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm:"
221,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,"So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm."
222,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,
223,THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER,
224,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,THE LITTLE BOY LOST
225,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,
226,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,"""Father, father, where are you going?"
227,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,Oh do not walk so fast!
228,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,"Speak, father, speak to your little boy,"
229,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,"Or else I shall be lost."""
230,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,
231,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,"The night was dark, no father was there,"
232,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,The child was wet with dew;
233,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,"The mire was deep, and the child did weep,"
234,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,And away the vapour flew.
235,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,
236,THE LITTLE BOY LOST,
237,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND
238,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,
239,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,"The little boy lost in the lonely fen,"
240,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,"Led by the wandering light,"
241,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,"Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,"
242,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,"Appeared like his father, in white."
243,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,
244,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,"He kissed the child, and by the hand led,"
245,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,"And to his mother brought,"
246,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,"Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,"
247,THE LITTLE BOY FOUND,The little boy weeping sought.

978,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,"A Chapel was built in the midst,"
979,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,Where I used to play on the green.
980,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,
981,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,And the gates of this Chapel were shut
982,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,"And ""Thou shalt not,"" writ over the door;"
983,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,So I turned to the Garden of Love
984,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,That so many sweet flowers bore.
985,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,
986,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,"And I saw it was filled with graves,"
987,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,And tombstones where flowers should be;
988,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,"And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,"
989,THE GARDEN OF LOVE,And binding with briars my joys and desires.

1306,I,To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day:
1307,I,Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard;
1308,I,And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew.
1309,I,
1310,I,O life of this our spring!  why fades the lotus of the water?
1311,I,Why fade these children of the spring? born but to smile & fall.
1312,I,"Ah! Thel is like a watry bow, and like a parting cloud,"
1313,I,Like a reflection in a glass: like shadows in the water
1314,I,"Like dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infants face."

1320,I,The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass
1321,I,"Answerd the lovely maid and said: I am a watry weed,"
1322,I,And I am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales:
1323,I,So weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head
1324,I,Yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all
1325,I,"Walks in the valley, and each morn over me spreads his hand"
1326,I,"Saying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou new-born lily flower."
1327,I,Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks:
1328,I,"For thou shall be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna:"
1329,I,Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs
1330,I,To flourish in eternal vales: they why should Thel complain.
1331,I,"Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh."
1332,I,
1333,I,"She ceasd & smild in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine."
1334,I,
1335,I,"Thel answerd, O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley."
1336,I,"Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o'er tired"
1337,I,"The breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells the milky garments"
1338,I,"He crops thy flowers while thou sittest smiling in his face,"
1339,I,Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints.
1340,I,Thy wine doth purify the golden honey; thy perfume.
1341,I,Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs
1342,I,"Revives the milked cow, & tames the fire-breathing steed."
1343,I,But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun:
1344,I,"I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place."
1345,I,
1346,I,"Queen of the vales the Lily answered, ask the tender cloud,"
1347,I,And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky.
1348,I,And why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air.
1349,I,Descend O little cloud & hover before the eyes of Thel.

1363,II.,Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel.
1364,II.,
1365,II.,O virgin know'st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs
1366,II.,Where Luvah doth renew his horses: lookst thou on my youth.
1367,II.,And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more.
1368,II.,"Nothing remains; O maid I tell thee, when I pass away."
1369,II.,"It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy:"
1370,II.,"Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers:"
1371,II.,"And court the fair eyed dew, to take me to her shining tent"
1372,II.,"The weeping virgin, trembling kneels before the risen sun."
1373,II.,Till we arise link'd in a golden band and never part:
1374,II.,But walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers.
1375,II.,
1376,II.,Dost thou O little cloud?  I fear that I am not like thee:
1377,II.,"For I walk through the vales of Har, and smell the sweetest flowers:"
1378,II.,"But I feed not the little flowers: I hear the warbling birds,"
1379,II.,"But I feed not the warbling birds, they fly and seek their food:"
1380,II.,But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away
1381,II.,"And all shall say, without a use this shining women liv'd,"
1382,II.,Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms.
1383,II.,
1384,II.,The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answerd thus.
1385,II.,
1386,II.,"Then if thou art the food of worms, O virgin of the skies,"
1387,II.,"How great thy use, how great thy blessing, every thing that lives."
1388,II.,"Lives not alone nor or itself: fear not and I will call,"
1389,II.,"The weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice."
1390,II.,"Come forth worm and the silent valley, to thy pensive queen."
1391,II.,
1392,II.,"The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf,"
1393,II.,"And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale."
1394,II.,
1395,II.,
1396,III.,III.
1397,III.,
1398,III.,Then Thel astonish'd view'd the Worm upon its dewy bed.
1399,III.,
1400,III.,"Art thou a Worm?  image of weakness,  art thou but a Worm?"
1401,III.,I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf;
1402,III.,"Ah weep not little voice, thou can'st not speak, but thou can'st weep:"
1403,III.,Is this a Worm?  I see they lay helpless & naked: weeping
1404,III.,"And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles."
1405,III.,
1406,III.,The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice & rais'd her pitying head:
1407,III.,"She bowd over the weeping infant, and her life exhald"
1408,III.,"In milky fondness, then on Thel she fix'd her humble eyes;"
1409,III.,
1410,III.,"O beauty of the vales of Har, we live not for ourselves,"
1411,III.,"Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed:"
1412,III.,"My bosom of itself is cold, and of itself is dark,"
1413,III.,
1414,III.,"But he that loves the lowly, pours his oil upon my head"
1415,III.,"And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast."
1416,III.,"And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee"
1417,III.,And I have given thee a crown that none can take away.
1418,III.,"But how this is sweet maid, I know not, and I cannot know"
1419,III.,"I ponder, and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love."
1420,III.,
1421,III.,"The daughter of beauty wip'd her pitying tears with her white veil,"
1422,III.,"And said, Alas!  I knew not this, and therefore did I weep:"
1423,III.,"That God would love a Worm I knew, and punish the evil foot"
1424,III.,That wilful bruis'd its helpless form: but that he cherish'd it
1425,III.,"With milk and oil I never knew, and therefore did I weep,"
1426,III.,"And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away."
1427,III.,"And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot."
1428,III.,
1429,III.,"Queen of the vales, the matron Clay answered: I heard thy sighs."
1430,III.,"And all thy moans flew o'er my roof, but I have call'd them down:"
1431,III.,"Wilt thou O Queen enter my house, tis given thee to enter,"
1432,III.,"And to return: fear nothing, enter with thy virgin feet."

1437,IV.,The eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar:
1438,IV.,Thel enter'd in & saw the secrets of the land unknown;
1439,IV.,"She saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous roots"
1440,IV.,Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists:
1441,IV.,A land of sorrows & of tears where never smile was seen.
1442,IV.,
1443,IV.,"She wandered in the land of clouds thro' valleys dark, listning"
1444,IV.,Dolors & lamentations: waiting oft beside the dewy grave
1445,IV.,"She stood in silence, listning to the voices of the ground,"
1446,IV.,"Till to her own grave plot she came, & there she sat down."
1447,IV.,And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.
1448,IV.,
1449,IV.,Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?
1450,IV.,Or the glistening Eye to the poison of a smile!
1451,IV.,"Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn,"
1452,IV.,Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie!
1453,IV.,Or an Eye of gifts & graces showring fruits & coined gold!
1454,IV.,
1455,IV.,Why a Tongue impress'd with honey from every wind?
1456,IV.,"Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?"
1457,IV.,Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling & affright
1458,IV.,Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy?
1459,IV.,Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?
1460,IV.,
1461,IV.,"The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek,"
1462,IV.,Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har.
