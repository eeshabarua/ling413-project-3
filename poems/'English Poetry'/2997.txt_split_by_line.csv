53,PREFACE,IN collecting the following poems I have to thank the editors and
54,PREFACE,proprietors of the periodicals in which certain of them have appeared for
55,PREFACE,permission to reclaim them.
56,PREFACE,
57,PREFACE,"Now that the miscellany is brought together, some lack of concord in"
58,PREFACE,"pieces written at widely severed dates, and in contrasting moods and"
59,PREFACE,"circumstances, will be obvious enough.  This I cannot help, but the sense"
60,PREFACE,"of disconnection, particularly in respect of those lyrics penned in the"
61,PREFACE,"first person, will be immaterial when it is borne in mind that they are"
62,PREFACE,"to be regarded, in the main, as dramatic monologues by different"
63,PREFACE,characters.
64,PREFACE,
65,PREFACE,"As a whole they will, I hope, take the reader forward, even if not far,"
66,PREFACE,rather than backward.  I should add that some lines in the early-dated
67,PREFACE,"poems have been rewritten, though they have been left substantially"
68,PREFACE,unchanged.

183,THE REVISITATION,THE REVISITATION
184,THE REVISITATION,
185,THE REVISITATION,
186,THE REVISITATION,AS I lay awake at night-time
187,THE REVISITATION,"In an ancient country barrack known to ancient cannoneers,"
188,THE REVISITATION,And recalled the hopes that heralded each seeming brave and bright
189,THE REVISITATION,time
190,THE REVISITATION,"Of my primal purple years,"
191,THE REVISITATION,
192,THE REVISITATION,"Much it haunted me that, nigh there,"
193,THE REVISITATION,"I had borne my bitterest loss—when One who went, came not again;"
194,THE REVISITATION,"In a joyless hour of discord, in a joyless-hued July there—"
195,THE REVISITATION,A July just such as then.
196,THE REVISITATION,
197,THE REVISITATION,"And as thus I brooded longer,"
198,THE REVISITATION,"With my faint eyes on the feeble square of wan-lit window frame,"
199,THE REVISITATION,"A quick conviction sprung within me, grew, and grew yet stronger,"
200,THE REVISITATION,"That the month-night was the same,"
201,THE REVISITATION,
202,THE REVISITATION,"Too, as that which saw her leave me"
203,THE REVISITATION,"On the rugged ridge of Waterstone, the peewits plaining round;"
204,THE REVISITATION,And a lapsing twenty years had ruled that—as it were to grieve me—
205,THE REVISITATION,I should near the once-loved ground.
206,THE REVISITATION,
207,THE REVISITATION,Though but now a war-worn stranger
208,THE REVISITATION,"Chance had quartered here, I rose up and descended to the yard."
209,THE REVISITATION,"All was soundless, save the troopers’ horses tossing at the manger,"
210,THE REVISITATION,And the sentry keeping guard.
211,THE REVISITATION,
212,THE REVISITATION,Through the gateway I betook me
213,THE REVISITATION,"Down the High Street and beyond the lamps, across the battered bridge,"
214,THE REVISITATION,Till the country darkness clasped me and the friendly shine forsook
215,THE REVISITATION,"me,"
216,THE REVISITATION,"And I bore towards the Ridge,"
217,THE REVISITATION,
218,THE REVISITATION,With a dim unowned emotion
219,THE REVISITATION,"Saying softly: “Small my reason, now at midnight, to be here . . ."
220,THE REVISITATION,Yet a sleepless swain of fifty with a brief romantic notion
221,THE REVISITATION,May retrace a track so dear.”
222,THE REVISITATION,
223,THE REVISITATION,Thus I walked with thoughts half-uttered
224,THE REVISITATION,"Up the lane I knew so well, the grey, gaunt, lonely Lane of Slyre;"
225,THE REVISITATION,"And at whiles behind me, far at sea, a sullen thunder muttered"
226,THE REVISITATION,As I mounted high and higher.
227,THE REVISITATION,
228,THE REVISITATION,"Till, the upper roadway quitting,"
229,THE REVISITATION,"I adventured on the open drouthy downland thinly grassed,"
230,THE REVISITATION,"While the spry white scuts of conies flashed before me, earthward"
231,THE REVISITATION,"flitting,"
232,THE REVISITATION,And an arid wind went past.
233,THE REVISITATION,
234,THE REVISITATION,Round about me bulged the barrows
235,THE REVISITATION,"As before, in antique silence—immemorial funeral piles—"
236,THE REVISITATION,Where the sleek herds trampled daily the remains of flint-tipt arrows
237,THE REVISITATION,Mid the thyme and chamomiles;
238,THE REVISITATION,
239,THE REVISITATION,"And the Sarsen stone there, dateless,"
240,THE REVISITATION,"On whose breast we had sat and told the zephyrs many a tender vow,"
241,THE REVISITATION,"Held the heat of yester sun, as sank thereon one fated mateless"
242,THE REVISITATION,From those far fond hours till now.
243,THE REVISITATION,
244,THE REVISITATION,Maybe flustered by my presence
245,THE REVISITATION,"Rose the peewits, just as all those years back, wailing soft and loud,"
246,THE REVISITATION,And revealing their pale pinions like a fitful phosphorescence
247,THE REVISITATION,"Up against the cope of cloud,"
248,THE REVISITATION,
249,THE REVISITATION,Where their dolesome exclamations
250,THE REVISITATION,Seemed the voicings of the self-same throats I had heard when life was
251,THE REVISITATION,"green,"
252,THE REVISITATION,Though since that day uncounted frail forgotten generations
253,THE REVISITATION,Of their kind had flecked the scene.—
254,THE REVISITATION,
255,THE REVISITATION,"And so, living long and longer"
256,THE REVISITATION,"In a past that lived no more, my eyes discerned there, suddenly,"
257,THE REVISITATION,"That a figure broke the skyline—first in vague contour, then stronger,"
258,THE REVISITATION,And was crossing near to me.
259,THE REVISITATION,
260,THE REVISITATION,"Some long-missed familiar gesture,"
261,THE REVISITATION,"Something wonted, struck me in the figure’s pause to list and heed,"
262,THE REVISITATION,Till I fancied from its handling of its loosely wrapping vesture
263,THE REVISITATION,That it might be She indeed.
264,THE REVISITATION,
265,THE REVISITATION,’Twas not reasonless: below there
266,THE REVISITATION,"In the vale, had been her home; the nook might hold her even yet,"
267,THE REVISITATION,And the downlands were her father’s fief; she still might come and go
268,THE REVISITATION,there;—
269,THE REVISITATION,"So I rose, and said, “Agnette!”"
270,THE REVISITATION,
271,THE REVISITATION,"With a little leap, half-frightened,"
272,THE REVISITATION,She withdrew some steps; then letting intuition smother fear
273,THE REVISITATION,"In a place so long-accustomed, and as one whom thought enlightened,"
274,THE REVISITATION,She replied: “What—_that_ voice?—here!”
275,THE REVISITATION,
276,THE REVISITATION,"“Yes, Agnette!—And did the occasion"
277,THE REVISITATION,Of our marching hither make you think I _might_ walk where we two—”
278,THE REVISITATION,"“O, I often come,” she murmured with a moment’s coy evasion,"
279,THE REVISITATION,"“(’Tis not far),—and—think of you.”"
280,THE REVISITATION,
281,THE REVISITATION,"Then I took her hand, and led her"
282,THE REVISITATION,To the ancient people’s stone whereon I had sat.  There now sat we;
283,THE REVISITATION,"And together talked, until the first reluctant shyness fled her,"
284,THE REVISITATION,And she spoke confidingly.
285,THE REVISITATION,
286,THE REVISITATION,“It is _just_ as ere we parted!”
287,THE REVISITATION,"Said she, brimming high with joy.—“And when, then, came you here, and"
288,THE REVISITATION,why?”
289,THE REVISITATION,"“—Dear, I could not sleep for thinking of our trystings when"
290,THE REVISITATION,twin-hearted.”
291,THE REVISITATION,"She responded, “Nor could I."
292,THE REVISITATION,
293,THE REVISITATION,“There are few things I would rather
294,THE REVISITATION,"Than be wandering at this spirit-hour—lone-lived, my kindred dead—"
295,THE REVISITATION,On this wold of well-known feature I inherit from my father:
296,THE REVISITATION,"Night or day, I have no dread . . ."
297,THE REVISITATION,
298,THE REVISITATION,"“O I wonder, wonder whether"
299,THE REVISITATION,Any heartstring bore a signal-thrill between us twain or no?—
300,THE REVISITATION,"Some such influence can, at times, they say, draw severed souls"
301,THE REVISITATION,together.”
302,THE REVISITATION,"I said, “Dear, we’ll dream it so.”"
303,THE REVISITATION,
304,THE REVISITATION,"Each one’s hand the other’s grasping,"
305,THE REVISITATION,"And a mutual forgiveness won, we sank to silent thought,"
306,THE REVISITATION,"A large content in us that seemed our rended lives reclasping,"
307,THE REVISITATION,And contracting years to nought.
308,THE REVISITATION,
309,THE REVISITATION,"Till I, maybe overweary"
310,THE REVISITATION,"From the lateness, and a wayfaring so full of strain and stress"
311,THE REVISITATION,"For one no longer buoyant, to a peak so steep and eery,"
312,THE REVISITATION,Sank to slow unconsciousness . . .
313,THE REVISITATION,
314,THE REVISITATION,"How long I slept I knew not,"
315,THE REVISITATION,"But the brief warm summer night had slid when, to my swift surprise,"
316,THE REVISITATION,"A red upedging sun, of glory chambered mortals view not,"
317,THE REVISITATION,"Was blazing on my eyes,"
318,THE REVISITATION,
319,THE REVISITATION,From the Milton Woods to Dole-Hill
320,THE REVISITATION,"All the spacious landscape lighting, and around about my feet"
321,THE REVISITATION,Flinging tall thin tapering shadows from the meanest mound and
322,THE REVISITATION,"mole-hill,"
323,THE REVISITATION,And on trails the ewes had beat.
324,THE REVISITATION,
325,THE REVISITATION,"She was sitting still beside me,"
326,THE REVISITATION,"Dozing likewise; and I turned to her, to take her hanging hand;"
327,THE REVISITATION,"When, the more regarding, that which like a spectre shook and tried me"
328,THE REVISITATION,In her image then I scanned;
329,THE REVISITATION,
330,THE REVISITATION,That which Time’s transforming chisel
331,THE REVISITATION,"Had been tooling night and day for twenty years, and tooled too well,"
332,THE REVISITATION,"In its rendering of crease where curve was, where was raven, grizzle—"
333,THE REVISITATION,"Pits, where peonies once did dwell."
334,THE REVISITATION,
335,THE REVISITATION,"She had wakened, and perceiving"
336,THE REVISITATION,"(I surmise) my sigh and shock, my quite involuntary dismay,"
337,THE REVISITATION,"Up she started, and—her wasted figure all throughout it heaving—"
338,THE REVISITATION,"Said, “Ah, yes: I am _thus_ by day!"
339,THE REVISITATION,
340,THE REVISITATION,“Can you really wince and wonder
341,THE REVISITATION,"That the sunlight should reveal you such a thing of skin and bone,"
342,THE REVISITATION,As if unaware a Death’s-head must of need lie not far under
343,THE REVISITATION,Flesh whose years out-count your own?
344,THE REVISITATION,
345,THE REVISITATION,“Yes: that movement was a warning
346,THE REVISITATION,"Of the worth of man’s devotion!—Yes, Sir, I am _old_,” said she,"
347,THE REVISITATION,“And the thing which should increase love turns it quickly into
348,THE REVISITATION,scorning—
349,THE REVISITATION,And your new-won heart from me!”
350,THE REVISITATION,
351,THE REVISITATION,"Then she went, ere I could call her,"
352,THE REVISITATION,"With the too proud temper ruling that had parted us before,"
353,THE REVISITATION,"And I saw her form descend the slopes, and smaller grow and smaller,"
354,THE REVISITATION,Till I caught its course no more . . .
355,THE REVISITATION,
356,THE REVISITATION,True; I might have dogged her downward;
357,THE REVISITATION,—But it _may_ be (though I know not) that this trick on us of Time
358,THE REVISITATION,"Disconcerted and confused me.—Soon I bent my footsteps townward,"
359,THE REVISITATION,Like to one who had watched a crime.
360,THE REVISITATION,
361,THE REVISITATION,"Well I knew my native weakness,"
362,THE REVISITATION,"Well I know it still.  I cherished her reproach like physic-wine,"
363,THE REVISITATION,For I saw in that emaciate shape of bitterness and bleakness
364,THE REVISITATION,A nobler soul than mine.
365,THE REVISITATION,
366,THE REVISITATION,"Did I not return, then, ever?—"
367,THE REVISITATION,"Did we meet again?—mend all?—Alas, what greyhead perseveres!—"
368,THE REVISITATION,Soon I got the Route elsewhither.—Since that hour I have seen her

521,XIII,NOTES.—“Windwhistle” (Stanza iv.).  The highness and dryness of
522,XIII,"Windwhistle Inn was impressed upon the writer two or three years ago,"
523,XIII,"when, after climbing on a hot afternoon to the beautiful spot near which"
524,XIII,"it stands and entering the inn for tea, he was informed by the landlady"
525,XIII,"that none could be had, unless he would fetch water from a valley half a"
526,XIII,"mile off, the house containing not a drop, owing to its situation."
527,XIII,"However, a tantalizing row of full barrels behind her back testified to a"
528,XIII,"wetness of a certain sort, which was not at that time desired."
529,XIII,
530,XIII,"“Marshal’s Elm” (Stanza vi.) so picturesquely situated, is no longer an"
531,XIII,"inn, though the house, or part of it, still remains.  It used to exhibit"
532,XIII,a fine old swinging sign.
533,XIII,
534,XIII,“Blue Jimmy” (Stanza x.) was a notorious horse-stealer of Wessex in those
535,XIII,"days, who appropriated more than a hundred horses before he was caught,"
536,XIII,among others one belonging to a neighbour of the writer’s grandfather.
537,XIII,He was hanged at the now demolished Ivel-chester or Ilchester jail above
538,XIII,mentioned—that building formerly of so many sinister associations in the
539,XIII,"minds of the local peasantry, and the continual haunt of fever, which at"
540,XIII,last led to its condemnation.  Its site is now an innocent-looking green
541,XIII,meadow.

698,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
699,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"“To-morrow I will walk your way,”"

703,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
704,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"The sunset-shine, as curfew strook,"
705,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"As curfew strook beyond the lea,"

708,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
709,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,He pulled from underneath his smock
710,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"The herb I sought, my curse to be—"
711,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"“At times I use it in my flock,”"

718,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
719,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"That night I watched the poppling brew,"
720,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,With bended back and hand on knee:

724,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"“This scandal shall be slain,” said I,"

728,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
729,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"“Here’s physic for untimely fruit,”"

734,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"—Next Sunday came, with sweet church chimes"
735,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"In Pydel Vale, alas for me:"

738,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
739,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"“Mother, instead of rescue nigh,”"

753,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,

757,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,(O why should mothers ever be!)
758,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
759,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"“Ha-ha!  Such well-kept news!” laughed they,"
760,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"Yes—so they laughed, alas for me."
761,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,“Whose banns were called in church to-day?”—
762,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"Christ, how I wished my soul could flee!"
763,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,

768,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
769,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,“But you are pale—you did not know?”
770,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"They archly asked, alas for me,"
771,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"I stammered, “Yes—some days-ago,”"
772,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,While coffined clay I wished to be.
773,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
774,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"“’Twas done to please her, we surmise?”"
775,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,(They spoke quite lightly in their glee)
776,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,“Done by him as a fond surprise?”
777,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,I thought their words would madden me.
778,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
779,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,Her lover entered.  “Where’s my bird?—
780,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,My bird—my flower—my picotee?
781,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"First time of asking, soon the third!”"
782,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"Ah, in my grave I well may be."
783,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
784,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,To me he whispered: “Since your call—”
785,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"So spoke he then, alas for me—"
786,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"“I’ve felt for her, and righted all.”"
787,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,—I think of it to agony.
788,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
789,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,“She’s faint to-day—tired—nothing more—”
790,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"Thus did I lie, alas for me . . ."
791,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,I called her at her chamber door
792,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,As one who scarce had strength to be.
793,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
794,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,No voice replied.  I went within—
795,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,O women! scourged the worst are we . . .
796,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,I shrieked.  The others hastened in
797,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,And saw the stroke there dealt on me.
798,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
799,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"There she lay—silent, breathless, dead,"
800,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"Stone dead she lay—wronged, sinless she!—"
801,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,Ghost-white the cheeks once rosy-red:
802,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,Death had took her.  Death took not me.
803,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,
804,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"I kissed her colding face and hair,"
805,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,I kissed her corpse—the bride to be!—
806,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,"My punishment I cannot bear,"
807,A SUNDAY MORNING TRAGEDY,But pray God _not_ to pity me.

1623,FOUR FOOTPRINTS,
1624,FOUR FOOTPRINTS,“But that I body and soul was yours

1626,FOUR FOOTPRINTS,"He’s a confident man.  ‘The husband scores,’"
1627,FOUR FOOTPRINTS,"He says, ‘in the long run’ . . . Now, Dear, go!”"
1628,FOUR FOOTPRINTS,
1629,FOUR FOOTPRINTS,I went.  And to-day I pass the spot;
1630,FOUR FOOTPRINTS,It is only a smart the more to endure;
1631,FOUR FOOTPRINTS,"And she whom I held is as though she were not,"
1632,FOUR FOOTPRINTS,For they have resumed their honeymoon tour.

1644,IN THE VAULTED WAY,
1645,IN THE VAULTED WAY,"And then I kissed you,—despite my thought"

1647,IN THE VAULTED WAY,"On what you had deemed me, whose one long aim"
1648,IN THE VAULTED WAY,Had been to serve you; that what I sought
1649,IN THE VAULTED WAY,Lay not in a heart that could breathe such blame.
1650,IN THE VAULTED WAY,

1723,THE SIGH,
1724,THE SIGH,That there mingled with her feeling
1725,THE SIGH,Some sad thought she was concealing
1726,THE SIGH,It implied.
1727,THE SIGH,"—Not that she had ceased to love me,"
1728,THE SIGH,None on earth she set above me;
1729,THE SIGH,But she sighed.
1730,THE SIGH,
1731,THE SIGH,"She could not disguise a passion,"
1732,THE SIGH,"Dread, or doubt, in weakest fashion"
1733,THE SIGH,If she tried:
1734,THE SIGH,"Nothing seemed to hold us sundered,"

1739,THE SIGH,"And she loved me staunchly, truly,"
1740,THE SIGH,Till she died;
1741,THE SIGH,But she never made confession
1742,THE SIGH,"Why, at that first sweet concession,"
1743,THE SIGH,She had sighed.
1744,THE SIGH,
1745,THE SIGH,"It was in our May, remember;"
1746,THE SIGH,"And though now I near November,"
1747,THE SIGH,And abide

1770,“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”,“And is that true of _you_?” she cried
1771,“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”,In voice of troubled tune.
1772,“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”,I faltered: “Well . . . I did not think

1774,“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”,
1775,“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”,"She vanished with a curious smile,"
1776,“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”,"Which told me, plainlier than by word,"
1777,“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”,That my staunch pledge could scarce beguile
1778,“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”,The fear she had averred.
1779,“IN THE NIGHT SHE CAME”,"Her doubts then wrought their shape in me,"

3380,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Gilbert was far from port;
3381,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And—so it was—that time did see
3382,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Me housed at Manor Court.
3383,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3384,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,About the bowers of Manor Court
3385,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,The primrose pushed its head
3386,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"When, on a day at last, report"
3387,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Arrived of him I had wed.
3388,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3389,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"“Gilbert, my lord, is homeward bound,"
3390,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"His sloop is drawing near,"
3391,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,What shall I do when I am found
3392,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Not in his house but here?”
3393,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3394,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,“O I will heal the injuries
3395,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,I’ve done to him and thee.
3396,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,I’ll give him means to live at ease
3397,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Afar from Shastonb’ry.”
3398,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3399,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,When Gilbert came we both took thought:
3400,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"“Since comfort and good cheer,”"
3401,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"Said he, “So readily are bought,"
3402,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"He’s welcome to thee, Dear.”"
3403,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3404,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,So when my lord flung liberally
3405,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"His gold in Gilbert’s hands,"
3406,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,I coaxed and got my brothers three
3407,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Made stewards of his lands.
3408,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3409,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And then I coaxed him to install
3410,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"My other kith and kin,"
3411,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,With aim to benefit them all
3412,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Before his love ran thin.
3413,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3414,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And next I craved to be possessed
3415,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Of plate and jewels rare.
3416,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"He groaned: “You give me, Love, no rest,"
3417,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Take all the law will spare!”
3418,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3419,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And so in course of years my wealth
3420,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"Became a goodly hoard,"
3421,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"My steward brethren, too, by stealth"
3422,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Had each a fortune stored.
3423,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3424,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"Thereafter in the gloom he’d walk,"
3425,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And by and by began
3426,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"To say aloud in absent talk,"
3427,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,“I am a ruined man!—
3428,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3429,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"“I hardly could have thought,” he said,"
3430,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"“When first I looked on thee,"
3431,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"That one so soft, so rosy red,"
3432,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Could thus have beggared me!”
3433,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3434,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"Seeing his fair estates in pawn,"
3435,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"And him in such decline,"
3436,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,I knew that his domain had gone
3437,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,To lift up me and mine.
3438,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3439,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Next month upon a Sunday morn
3440,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,A gunshot sounded nigh:
3441,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,By his own hand my lordly born
3442,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Had doomed himself to die.
3443,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3444,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"“Live, my dear lord, and much of thine"
3445,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Shall be restored to thee!”
3446,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"He smiled, and said ’twixt word and sign,"
3447,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,“Alas—that cannot be!”
3448,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3449,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And while I searched his cabinet
3450,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"For letters, keys, or will,"
3451,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,’Twas touching that his gaze was set
3452,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,With love upon me still.
3453,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3454,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And when I burnt each document
3455,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"Before his dying eyes,"
3456,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,’Twas sweet that he did not resent
3457,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,My fear of compromise.
3458,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3459,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,The steeple-cock gleamed golden when
3460,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,I watched his spirit go:
3461,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And I became repentant then
3462,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,That I had wrecked him so.
3463,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3464,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"Three weeks at least had come and gone,"
3465,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"With many a saddened word,"
3466,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,Before I wrote to Gilbert on
3467,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,The stroke that so had stirred.
3468,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3469,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"And having worn a mournful gown,"
3470,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"I joined, in decent while,"
3471,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,My husband at a dashing town
3472,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,To live in dashing style.
3473,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3474,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"Yet though I now enjoy my fling,"
3475,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"And dine and dance and drive,"
3476,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,I’d give my prettiest emerald ring
3477,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,To see my lord alive.
3478,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3479,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And when the meet on hunting-days
3480,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"Is near his churchyard home,"
3481,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,I leave my bantering beaux to place
3482,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,A flower upon his tomb;
3483,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,
3484,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,And sometimes say: “Perhaps too late
3485,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,The saints in Heaven deplore
3486,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,"That tender time when, moved by Fate,"
3487,THE VAMPIRINE FAIR,He darked my cottage door.”

3783,(M. H.  1772–1857),"She would dwell on such dead themes, not as one who remembers,"
3784,(M. H.  1772–1857),But rather as one who sees.
3785,(M. H.  1772–1857),
3786,(M. H.  1772–1857),She seemed one left behind of a band gone distant
3787,(M. H.  1772–1857),So far that no tongue could hail:
3788,(M. H.  1772–1857),"Past things retold were to her as things existent,"
3789,(M. H.  1772–1857),Things present but as a tale.

3975,PANTHERA,PANTHERA
3976,PANTHERA,
3977,PANTHERA,
3978,PANTHERA,(For other forms of this legend—first met with in the second century—see
3979,PANTHERA,Origen contra Celsum; the Talmud; Sepher Toldoth Jeschu; quoted fragments
3980,PANTHERA,"of lost Apocryphal gospels; Strauss, Haeckel; etc.)"
3981,PANTHERA,
3982,PANTHERA,"YEA, as I sit here, crutched, and cricked, and bent,"
3983,PANTHERA,"I think of Panthera, who underwent"
3984,PANTHERA,Much from insidious aches in his decline;
3985,PANTHERA,But his aches were not radical like mine;
3986,PANTHERA,They were the twinges of old wounds—the feel
3987,PANTHERA,"Of the hand he had lost, shorn by barbarian steel,"
3988,PANTHERA,"Which came back, so he said, at a change in the air,"
3989,PANTHERA,"Fingers and all, as if it still were there."
3990,PANTHERA,My pains are otherwise: upclosing cramps
3991,PANTHERA,"And stiffened tendons from this country’s damps,"
3992,PANTHERA,Where Panthera was never commandant.—
3993,PANTHERA,The Fates sent him by way of the Levant.
3994,PANTHERA,"He had been blithe in his young manhood’s time,"
3995,PANTHERA,And as centurion carried well his prime.
3996,PANTHERA,"In Ethiop, Araby, climes fair and fell,"
3997,PANTHERA,He had seen service and had borne him well.
3998,PANTHERA,Nought shook him then: he was serene as brave;
3999,PANTHERA,"Yet later knew some shocks, and would grow grave"
4000,PANTHERA,When pondering them; shocks less of corporal kind
4001,PANTHERA,"Than phantom-like, that disarranged his mind;"
4002,PANTHERA,And it was in the way of warning me
4003,PANTHERA,(By much his junior) against levity
4004,PANTHERA,That he recounted them; and one in chief
4005,PANTHERA,Panthera loved to set in bold relief.
4006,PANTHERA,
4007,PANTHERA,"This was a tragedy of his Eastern days,"
4008,PANTHERA,Personal in touch—though I have sometimes thought
4009,PANTHERA,That touch a possible delusion—wrought
4010,PANTHERA,Of half-conviction carried to a craze—
4011,PANTHERA,His mind at last being stressed by ails and age:—
4012,PANTHERA,Yet his good faith thereon I well could wage.
4013,PANTHERA,
4014,PANTHERA,I had said it long had been a wish with me
4015,PANTHERA,That I might leave a scion—some small tree
4016,PANTHERA,"As channel for my sap, if not my name—"
4017,PANTHERA,"Ay, offspring even of no legitimate claim,"
4018,PANTHERA,In whose advance I secretly could joy.
4019,PANTHERA,Thereat he warned.
4020,PANTHERA,"“Cancel such wishes, boy!"
4021,PANTHERA,"A son may be a comfort or a curse,"
4022,PANTHERA,"A seer, a doer, a coward, a fool; yea, worse—"
4023,PANTHERA,A criminal . . . That I could testify!”
4024,PANTHERA,“Panthera has no guilty son!” cried I
4025,PANTHERA,"All unbelieving.  “Friend, you do not know,”"
4026,PANTHERA,"He darkly dropt: “True, I’ve none now to show,"
4027,PANTHERA,"For _the law took him_.  Ay, in sooth, Jove shaped it so!”"
4028,PANTHERA,
4029,PANTHERA,"“This noon is not unlike,” he again began,"
4030,PANTHERA,“The noon these pricking memories print on me—
4031,PANTHERA,"Yea, that day, when the sun grew copper-red,"
4032,PANTHERA,And I served in Judæa . . . ’Twas a date
4033,PANTHERA,"Of rest for arms.  The _Pax Romana_ ruled,"
4034,PANTHERA,To the chagrin of frontier legionaries!
4035,PANTHERA,"Palestine was annexed—though sullen yet,—"
4036,PANTHERA,"I, being in age some two-score years and ten"
4037,PANTHERA,And having the garrison in Jerusalem
4038,PANTHERA,Part in my hands as acting officer
4039,PANTHERA,Under the Governor.  A tedious time
4040,PANTHERA,"I found it, of routine, amid a folk"
4041,PANTHERA,"Restless, contentless, and irascible.—"
4042,PANTHERA,"Quelling some riot, sentrying court and hall,"
4043,PANTHERA,Sending men forth on public meeting-days
4044,PANTHERA,"To maintain order, were my duties there."
4045,PANTHERA,
4046,PANTHERA,"“Then came a morn in spring, and the cheerful sun"
4047,PANTHERA,"Whitened the city and the hills around,"
4048,PANTHERA,"And every mountain-road that clambered them,"
4049,PANTHERA,"Tincturing the greyness of the olives warm,"
4050,PANTHERA,And the rank cacti round the valley’s sides.
4051,PANTHERA,The day was one whereon death-penalties
4052,PANTHERA,"Were put in force, and here and there were set"
4053,PANTHERA,"The soldiery for order, as I said,"
4054,PANTHERA,"Since one of the condemned had raised some heat,"
4055,PANTHERA,And crowds surged passionately to see him slain.
4056,PANTHERA,"I, mounted on a Cappadocian horse,"
4057,PANTHERA,"With some half-company of auxiliaries,"
4058,PANTHERA,Had captained the procession through the streets
4059,PANTHERA,When it came streaming from the judgment-hall
4060,PANTHERA,After the verdicts of the Governor.
4061,PANTHERA,It drew to the great gate of the northern way
4062,PANTHERA,That bears towards Damascus; and to a knoll
4063,PANTHERA,"Upon the common, just beyond the walls—"
4064,PANTHERA,Whence could be swept a wide horizon round
4065,PANTHERA,Over the housetops to the remotest heights.
4066,PANTHERA,Here was the public execution-ground
4067,PANTHERA,"For city crimes, called then and doubtless now"
4068,PANTHERA,"Golgotha, Kranion, or Calvaria."
4069,PANTHERA,
4070,PANTHERA,“The usual dooms were duly meted out;
4071,PANTHERA,"Some three or four were stript, transfixed, and nailed,"
4072,PANTHERA,And no great stir occurred.  A day of wont
4073,PANTHERA,"It was to me, so far, and would have slid"
4074,PANTHERA,Clean from my memory at its squalid close
4075,PANTHERA,But for an incident that followed these.
4076,PANTHERA,
4077,PANTHERA,“Among the tag-rag rabble of either sex
4078,PANTHERA,"That hung around the wretches as they writhed,"
4079,PANTHERA,"Till thrust back by our spears, one held my eye—"
4080,PANTHERA,"A weeping woman, whose strained countenance,"
4081,PANTHERA,"Sharpened against a looming livid cloud,"
4082,PANTHERA,Was mocked by the crude rays of afternoon—
4083,PANTHERA,The mother of one of those who suffered there
4084,PANTHERA,I had heard her called when spoken roughly to
4085,PANTHERA,By my ranged men for pressing forward so.
4086,PANTHERA,It stole upon me hers was a face I knew;
4087,PANTHERA,"Yet when, or how, I had known it, for a while"
4088,PANTHERA,Eluded me.  And then at once it came.
4089,PANTHERA,
4090,PANTHERA,“Some thirty years or more before that noon
4091,PANTHERA,I was sub-captain of a company
4092,PANTHERA,"Drawn from the legion of Calabria,"
4093,PANTHERA,That marched up from Judæa north to Tyre.
4094,PANTHERA,"We had pierced the old flat country of Jezreel,"
4095,PANTHERA,The great Esdraelon Plain and fighting-floor
4096,PANTHERA,"Of Jew with Canaanite, and with the host"
4097,PANTHERA,"Of Pharaoh-Necho, king of Egypt, met"
4098,PANTHERA,While crossing there to strike the Assyrian pride.
4099,PANTHERA,We left behind Gilboa; passed by Nain;
4100,PANTHERA,"Till bulging Tabor rose, embossed to the top"
4101,PANTHERA,"With arbute, terabinth, and locust growths."
4102,PANTHERA,
4103,PANTHERA,"“Encumbering me were sundry sick, so fallen"
4104,PANTHERA,Through drinking from a swamp beside the way;
4105,PANTHERA,"But we pressed on, till, bearing over a ridge,"
4106,PANTHERA,We dipt into a world of pleasantness—
4107,PANTHERA,"A vale, the fairest I had gazed upon—"
4108,PANTHERA,Which lapped a village on its furthest slopes
4109,PANTHERA,"Called Nazareth, brimmed round by uplands nigh."
4110,PANTHERA,"In the midst thereof a fountain bubbled, where,"
4111,PANTHERA,"Lime-dry from marching, our glad halt we made"
4112,PANTHERA,"To rest our sick ones, and refresh us all."
4113,PANTHERA,
4114,PANTHERA,"“Here a day onward, towards the eventide,"
4115,PANTHERA,Our men were piping to a Pyrrhic dance
4116,PANTHERA,"Trod by their comrades, when the young women came"
4117,PANTHERA,"To fill their pitchers, as their custom was."
4118,PANTHERA,"I proffered help to one—a slim girl, coy"
4119,PANTHERA,"Even as a fawn, meek, and as innocent."
4120,PANTHERA,"Her long blue gown, the string of silver coins"
4121,PANTHERA,"That hung down by her banded beautiful hair,"
4122,PANTHERA,Symboled in full immaculate modesty.
4123,PANTHERA,
4124,PANTHERA,"“Well, I was young, and hot, and readily stirred"
4125,PANTHERA,To quick desire.  ’Twas tedious timing out
4126,PANTHERA,The convalescence of the soldiery;
4127,PANTHERA,And I beguiled the long and empty days
4128,PANTHERA,"By blissful yieldance to her sweet allure,"
4129,PANTHERA,"Who had no arts, but what out-arted all,"
4130,PANTHERA,The tremulous tender charm of trustfulness.
4131,PANTHERA,"We met, and met, and under the winking stars"
4132,PANTHERA,"That passed which peoples earth—true union, yea,"
4133,PANTHERA,To the pure eye of her simplicity.
4134,PANTHERA,
4135,PANTHERA,“Meanwhile the sick found health; and we pricked on.
4136,PANTHERA,"I made her no rash promise of return,"
4137,PANTHERA,As some do use; I was sincere in that;
4138,PANTHERA,I said we sundered never to meet again—
4139,PANTHERA,And yet I spoke untruth unknowingly!—
4140,PANTHERA,"For meet again we did.  Now, guess you aught?"
4141,PANTHERA,The weeping mother on Calvaria
4142,PANTHERA,Was she I had known—albeit that time and tears
4143,PANTHERA,"Had wasted rudely her once flowerlike form,"
4144,PANTHERA,"And her soft eyes, now swollen with sorrowing."
4145,PANTHERA,
4146,PANTHERA,"“Though I betrayed some qualms, she marked me not;"
4147,PANTHERA,And I was scarce of mood to comrade her
4148,PANTHERA,And close the silence of so wide a time
4149,PANTHERA,To claim a malefactor as my son—
4150,PANTHERA,(For so I guessed him).  And inquiry made
4151,PANTHERA,Brought rumour how at Nazareth long before
4152,PANTHERA,An old man wedded her for pity’s sake
4153,PANTHERA,"On finding she had grown pregnant, none knew how,"
4154,PANTHERA,"Cared for her child, and loved her till he died."
4155,PANTHERA,
4156,PANTHERA,“Well; there it ended; save that then I learnt
4157,PANTHERA,That he—the man whose ardent blood was mine—
4158,PANTHERA,"Had waked sedition long among the Jews,"
4159,PANTHERA,"And hurled insulting parlance at their god,"
4160,PANTHERA,"Whose temple bulked upon the adjoining hill,"
4161,PANTHERA,"Vowing that he would raze it, that himself"
4162,PANTHERA,"Was god as great as he whom they adored,"
4163,PANTHERA,"And by descent, moreover, was their king;"
4164,PANTHERA,With sundry other incitements to misrule.
4165,PANTHERA,
4166,PANTHERA,"“The impalements done, and done the soldiers’ game"
4167,PANTHERA,"Of raffling for the clothes, a legionary,"
4168,PANTHERA,"Longinus, pierced the young man with his lance"
4169,PANTHERA,"At signs from me, moved by his agonies"
4170,PANTHERA,Through naysaying the drug they had offered him.
4171,PANTHERA,It brought the end.  And when he had breathed his last
4172,PANTHERA,The woman went.  I saw her never again . . .
4173,PANTHERA,"Now glares my moody meaning on you, friend?—"

4175,PANTHERA,"So trustingly, you blink contingencies."

4177,PANTHERA,Gives frightful hostages to hazardry!”
4178,PANTHERA,
4179,PANTHERA,"Thus Panthera’s tale.  ’Twas one he seldom told,"
4180,PANTHERA,"But yet it got abroad.  He would unfold,"
4181,PANTHERA,"At other times, a story of less gloom,"
4182,PANTHERA,Though his was not a heart where jests had room.
4183,PANTHERA,He would regret discovery of the truth
4184,PANTHERA,Was made too late to influence to ruth
4185,PANTHERA,The Procurator who had condemned his son—
4186,PANTHERA,Or rather him so deemed.  For there was none
4187,PANTHERA,"To prove that Panthera erred not: and indeed,"
4188,PANTHERA,"When vagueness of identity I would plead,"
4189,PANTHERA,Panther himself would sometimes own as much—
4190,PANTHERA,"Yet lothly.  But, assuming fact was such,"
4191,PANTHERA,That the said woman did not recognize
4192,PANTHERA,"Her lover’s face, is matter for surprise."
4193,PANTHERA,"However, there’s his tale, fantasy or otherwise."
4194,PANTHERA,
4195,PANTHERA,Thereafter shone not men of Panthera’s kind:
4196,PANTHERA,The indolent heads at home were ill-inclined
4197,PANTHERA,To press campaigning that would hoist the star
4198,PANTHERA,Of their lieutenants valorous afar.
4199,PANTHERA,"Jealousies kept him irked abroad, controlled"
4200,PANTHERA,And stinted by an Empire no more bold.
4201,PANTHERA,Yet in some actions southward he had share—
4202,PANTHERA,In Mauretania and Numidia; there
4203,PANTHERA,"With eagle eye, and sword and steed and spur,"
4204,PANTHERA,Quelling uprisings promptly.  Some small stir
4205,PANTHERA,"In Parthia next engaged him, until maimed,"
4206,PANTHERA,As I have said; and cynic Time proclaimed
4207,PANTHERA,His noble spirit broken.  What a waste
4208,PANTHERA,Of such a Roman!—one in youth-time graced
4209,PANTHERA,"With indescribable charm, so I have heard,"
4210,PANTHERA,"Yea, magnetism impossible to word"
4211,PANTHERA,"When faltering as I saw him.  What a fame,"
4212,PANTHERA,"O Son of Saturn, had adorned his name,"
4213,PANTHERA,Might the Three so have urged Thee!—Hour by hour
4214,PANTHERA,His own disorders hampered Panthera’s power
4215,PANTHERA,"To brood upon the fate of those he had known,"
4216,PANTHERA,Even of that one he always called his own—
4217,PANTHERA,Either in morbid dream or memory . . .
4218,PANTHERA,"He died at no great age, untroublously,"
4219,PANTHERA,An exit rare for ardent soldiers such as he.
