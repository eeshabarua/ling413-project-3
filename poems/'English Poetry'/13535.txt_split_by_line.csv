55,INTRODUCTION,
56,INTRODUCTION,When a poem is read aloud it is easy to realize that poetry is closely
57,INTRODUCTION,"related to music.  Like music it awakens vague, mysterious feelings"
58,INTRODUCTION,which cannot be expressed in ordinary speech; and the person who fails
59,INTRODUCTION,to catch the subtle melody of a poem gets but little from it even
60,INTRODUCTION,though he understands perfectly the meaning of the words. To illustrate
61,INTRODUCTION,"this, put into commonplace prose a passage of beautiful verse,--for"
62,INTRODUCTION,"instance, lines 358-372 of _The Ancient Mariner_, beginning, ""Sometimes"
63,INTRODUCTION,"a-dropping from the sky,""--and then compare the prose version with the"
64,INTRODUCTION,original.  The two will be found as unlike as the flower after it has
65,INTRODUCTION,"been dissected by the botanist, and the same flower still on the stalk,"
66,INTRODUCTION,opening its petals to the morning sun.
67,INTRODUCTION,
68,INTRODUCTION,"The Greeks divided all poetry into three kinds,--lyric, epic, and"
69,INTRODUCTION,"dramatic poetry, and there is no better general division.  The lyric,"
70,INTRODUCTION,"which is properly a song, expresses the transient feeling or mood of"
71,INTRODUCTION,"the writer, and therefore is never very long.  One must be sensitive to"
72,INTRODUCTION,"the music of verse to care for a poem of this kind, because it tells no"
73,INTRODUCTION,"story.  Dryden's _Song for St. Cecilia's Day_ and Gray's _Elegy_, both"
74,INTRODUCTION,"included in the present volume, are lyrics.  Among the most beautiful"
75,INTRODUCTION,"of English lyrics are Milton's _Lycidas_, Wordsworth's _Ode on"
76,INTRODUCTION,"Intimations of Immortality_, and Shelley's _To a Skylark_ and"
77,INTRODUCTION,_Adonais_; while of American poems of the same kind none is nobler than
78,INTRODUCTION,"Lowell's _Commemoration Ode_.  Short lyrics, among which are songs and"
79,INTRODUCTION,"sonnets, can be found in the works of almost every poet of note,"
80,INTRODUCTION,whether English or American.  Under the head of epic or narrative
81,INTRODUCTION,poetry are included long productions like the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_
82,INTRODUCTION,"of Homer and the _Paradise Lost_ of Milton, and shorter poems, such as"
83,INTRODUCTION,"Coleridge's _Ancient Mariner_ and _Longfellow's _Evangeline_.  Indeed,"
84,INTRODUCTION,"every piece of verse that tells a story, however short it may be,"
85,INTRODUCTION,belongs with the epics or narratives.  Dramatic poetry includes
86,INTRODUCTION,well-known plays like Shakespeare's _Merchant of Venice_ and _Julius
87,INTRODUCTION,"Caesar_, and also certain poems not written for the stage, such as"
88,INTRODUCTION,Browning's _Pippa Passes_ and Shelley's _Prometheus Unbound_.  In a
89,INTRODUCTION,"dramatic production the poet goes out of himself for the time being,"
90,INTRODUCTION,and expresses the thoughts and feelings of other characters.
91,INTRODUCTION,
92,INTRODUCTION,It may have been noticed that in this description of the principal
93,INTRODUCTION,"kinds of poetry, only three of the poems included in this book have"
94,INTRODUCTION,"been mentioned.  This is because the other three--_The Traveller_, _The"
95,INTRODUCTION,"Deserted Village_, and _The Cotter's Saturday Night_--do not fit"
96,INTRODUCTION,exactly into any of the divisions.  One would class them with the epics
97,INTRODUCTION,"rather than with the lyrics or the dramas, but they are not properly"
98,INTRODUCTION,"narratives, because they tell no story; they are really descriptive and"
99,INTRODUCTION,reflective poems.  One often comes upon a difficulty of this kind when
100,INTRODUCTION,"attempting to classify a poem, and the truth is that several smaller"
101,INTRODUCTION,divisions are necessary if every production is to be placed where it
102,INTRODUCTION,belongs.  But while it is desirable to know whether one is reading a
103,INTRODUCTION,"lyric, an epic, or a drama, it is far more important to enjoy a"
104,INTRODUCTION,beautiful poem than to be able properly to classify it.

139,JOHN DRYDEN,
140,JOHN DRYDEN,"Although Dryden is but little read in these days, he fills an important"
141,JOHN DRYDEN,place in the history of English literature.  As the foremost writer of
142,JOHN DRYDEN,"the last third of the seventeenth century, he is the connecting link"
143,JOHN DRYDEN,"between Milton, ""the last of the Elizabethans,"" and Pope, the chief"
144,JOHN DRYDEN,"poet of the age of Queen Anne.  He was born in Northamptonshire, and"
145,JOHN DRYDEN,"had the good fortune to live in the country until his thirteenth year,"
146,JOHN DRYDEN,"when he was sent to the famous Westminster School, in what is now the"
147,JOHN DRYDEN,heart of London.  A few years after finishing his course at Cambridge
148,JOHN DRYDEN,"University he went back to London, and lived there chiefly during the"
149,JOHN DRYDEN,rest of his long and busy life.  At the age of thirty-nine he was made
150,JOHN DRYDEN,"poet-laureate and historiographer-royal, although his best work was not"
151,JOHN DRYDEN,"done until after he was fifty years old.  From Milton's death, 1674,"
152,JOHN DRYDEN,"until his own in 1700, ""Glorious John,"" as he was called, reigned"
153,JOHN DRYDEN,"without a rival in English letters; and one can picture him as a short,"
154,JOHN DRYDEN,"stout, somewhat ruddy-faced gentleman, sitting in Will's Coffee House"
155,JOHN DRYDEN,surrounded by younger authors who vie with one another for the honor of
156,JOHN DRYDEN,"a pinch out of his snuffbox.  He died at the age of sixty-nine, and was"
157,JOHN DRYDEN,"buried in the Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey, near Chaucer and"
158,JOHN DRYDEN,Cowley.
159,JOHN DRYDEN,
160,JOHN DRYDEN,"Dryden is often called ""the first of the moderns.""  This is because he"
161,JOHN DRYDEN,"was one of the earliest to write clear, strong English prose, and"
162,JOHN DRYDEN,because as a poet he was thoughtful and brilliant rather than highly
163,JOHN DRYDEN,"imaginative.  Lowell says of him: ""He had, beyond most, the gift of the"
164,JOHN DRYDEN,right word. . . .  In ripeness of mind and bluff heartiness of
165,JOHN DRYDEN,"expression he takes rank with the best.""  Beside prose works and dramas"
166,JOHN DRYDEN,"he wrote poems of many kinds, including translations and paraphrases."
167,JOHN DRYDEN,"His satires are unrivaled.  The finest is, perhaps, the first part of"
168,JOHN DRYDEN,"_Absalom and Achitophel_.  He is now best known by two lyric poems,"
169,JOHN DRYDEN,_Alexander's Feast_ and the _Song for St. Cecilia's Day_; while his
170,JOHN DRYDEN,"_Palamon and Arcite_, a paraphrase of Chaucer's _Knightes Tale_, still"
171,JOHN DRYDEN,delights the reader who cares for a good story in verse.

313,THOMAS GRAY,1716-1771
314,THOMAS GRAY,
315,THOMAS GRAY,"In speaking of Gray, some one has said that no other writer has come"
316,THOMAS GRAY,down to posterity with such a small book under his arm; and to this may
317,THOMAS GRAY,be added the statement that every piece in his book shows careful
318,THOMAS GRAY,"finish.  His fame rests mainly on three poems: the _Elegy_, _The"
319,THOMAS GRAY,"Progress of Poesy_, and _The Bard_.  Of these the _Elegy_ is by far the"
320,THOMAS GRAY,"most popular, because it expresses in simple and beautiful language"
321,THOMAS GRAY,"sentiments which appeal to all, whatever their condition."
322,THOMAS GRAY,
323,THOMAS GRAY,"In character Gray was high-minded, and in temperament reserved and shy."
324,THOMAS GRAY,It is said that after he was acknowledged to be the greatest poet
325,THOMAS GRAY,"living in England, people used to watch eagerly for a glimpse of him;"
326,THOMAS GRAY,but he usually managed to elude them and to slip away unnoticed.  His
327,THOMAS GRAY,sensitiveness may have been due in part to the fact that his health was
328,THOMAS GRAY,delicate and that he was much alone when a child--for all his brothers
329,THOMAS GRAY,"and sisters died in infancy.  Although unfortunate in his father, he"
330,THOMAS GRAY,"was blessed with a devoted mother, who by her exertions enabled him to"
331,THOMAS GRAY,go to Cambridge University.  It is pleasant to know that he warmly
332,THOMAS GRAY,returned her love and that he now rests by her side in the churchyard
333,THOMAS GRAY,"at Stoke Poges, which is always associated with the _Elegy_.  On her"
334,THOMAS GRAY,"tomb he placed the inscription ""--mother of many children, one of whom"
335,THOMAS GRAY,"alone had the misfortune to survive her.""  Gray's friends were warmly"
336,THOMAS GRAY,"attached to him.  With one of them, Horace Walpole, the well-known"
337,THOMAS GRAY,"author and collector, he traveled on the continent soon after leaving"
338,THOMAS GRAY,the university; and although they quarreled and separated the
339,THOMAS GRAY,friendship was renewed later.  Gray never married.  In 1742 he returned
340,THOMAS GRAY,"to Cambridge and lived there during the rest of his life, with the"
341,THOMAS GRAY,exception of two years spent in London.  After he became famous the
342,THOMAS GRAY,"laureateship was offered to him, but his dislike of publicity caused"
343,THOMAS GRAY,him to refuse it.  In 1768 he was made Professor of Modern History and
344,THOMAS GRAY,Languages at Cambridge.  All his life he was a student; indeed he was
345,THOMAS GRAY,"the most learned of the English poets, except possibly Milton.  In some"
346,THOMAS GRAY,respects he was in advance of his age.  He appreciated certain kinds of
347,THOMAS GRAY,"poetry that no one else liked in his time, and he cared greatly for"
348,THOMAS GRAY,"wild nature.  In these days, when almost every one loves rugged"
349,THOMAS GRAY,"mountains and remote regions by the sea, it is hard to realize that"
350,THOMAS GRAY,there ever was a time when most persons preferred to look upon trim or
351,THOMAS GRAY,even stiff gardens or the cultivated grounds of a country seat; but
352,THOMAS GRAY,such was the case.  Gray's admiration for wild nature comes out in his
353,THOMAS GRAY,"prose, especially in his letters, and in his _Journal in the Lakes_"
354,THOMAS GRAY,"written in 1769; but later writers, Wordsworth above all, have"
355,THOMAS GRAY,expressed the same feeling in delightful verse.
356,THOMAS GRAY,
357,THOMAS GRAY,As a poet Gray stands for beauty of form rather than for depth of
358,THOMAS GRAY,"thought or breadth of sympathy.  He is first of all an artist, and his"
359,THOMAS GRAY,poems are among the most perfect in the English language.

545,THE EPITAPH,
546,THE EPITAPH,[2.] Incense-breathing Morn.  The poet regards the morning as a person;
547,THE EPITAPH,"that is, he personifies morning.  Personification is seldom used now,"

608,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,1728-1774
609,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,
610,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"Goldsmith was born in Pallas, an out-of-the-way hamlet in Longford"
611,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"County, Ireland, where his father, the curate, was looked upon as"
612,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"""passing rich, with forty pounds a year.""  Not long after, the family"
613,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"removed to Lissoy, in the County of Westmeath, where they lived in much"
614,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"comfort.  Here Oliver passed his childhood and youth, and it is"
615,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"doubtless to Lissoy that his thoughts returned when he wrote of ""Sweet"
616,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"Auburn, loveliest village of the plain.""  As a boy he had his share of"
617,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"troubles.  In school he was pronounced ""a stupid, heavy blockhead,"" and"
618,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,he was often made sport of by his companions on account of his awkward
619,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"figure and his homely face, pitted with the smallpox.  In his"
620,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"eighteenth year he entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a sizar, that"
621,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"is, a poor student who pays in part for his tuition by doing certain"
622,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,kinds of work.  After four years devoted to study--spiced with a good
623,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,deal of fun--he graduated at the foot of his class.
624,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,
625,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,At twenty-one he showed no special bent.  For a while he lived with his
626,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"mother, now a widow, and idled his time away with gay companions."
627,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"After being refused a position in the church, he resolved to try"
628,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,teaching; but this occupation proved so little to his taste that he
629,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,decided to give it up and study medicine.  With the help of a generous
630,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"uncle he entered the medical school at Edinburgh, leaving Ireland never"
631,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,to return.  At the end of a year and a half he concluded that foreign
632,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,travel would do more for him than a longer stay in Scotland.  His uncle
633,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"sent him twenty pounds, and with this he reached Leyden, where, if he"
634,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"possibly attended a few lectures, he certainly associated with wild"
635,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,companions who helped him to get rid of his money.  Having succeeded in
636,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"borrowing a small sum, he was about to leave Leyden, when in a"
637,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"florist's garden he saw a rare, high-priced flower which he felt sure"
638,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"would delight his kind uncle, who was an enthusiast in flower culture."
639,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"Without a thought of his own needs he ran in, bought a parcel of the"
640,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"roots, and sent them off to Ireland; then, with a guinea in his pocket,"
641,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,he started on his travels.  Although his uncle may have sent him small
642,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"sums occasionally, it is not easy to see how he managed to wander as he"
643,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,did from country to country.  It is said that he paid his way among the
644,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"peasants by flute playing, and that he returned the hospitality of"
645,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,convents by disputing on learned subjects; but these stories are
646,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"doubtless fictitious.  One thing is certain, he arrived in London in"
647,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"February, 1756, having reached the age of twenty-eight, with a medical"
648,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"degree, but with no money in his pocket."
649,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,
650,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,For two years he lived in the great city poor and unknown.  He was in
651,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"turn apothecary's assistant, poor physician, proof-reader, usher in a"
652,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"""classical school,"" and hack writer.  At last, almost discouraged, he"
653,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,decided to obtain if possible the position of factory surgeon on the
654,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"Coromandel coast, in India.  He failed to get the place, and was also"
655,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,unsuccessful in his efforts to pass the examination at Surgeon's Hall
656,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,for the humble post of hospital mate.
657,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,
658,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,At this point there was a turn in the tide of his fortunes.  While
659,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"seeking employment as a physician, he had been engaged upon a work"
660,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"called _Enquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe_,"
661,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,and with its publication in 1759 his career as an author began.  His
662,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"essays, which appeared in numerous magazines, brought him into further"
663,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"notice, especially a series collected later under the title, _The"
664,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,Citizen of the World_.  In 1764 he became a member of Dr. Johnson's
665,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"famous ""Literary Club"" that met at the ""Turk's Head.""  It was to"
666,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"Johnson that he once said, alluding to his heavy style,--""If you were"
667,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"to make little fishes talk, they would talk like whales.""  But there"
668,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"was no malice in this remark, for the doctor was one of his stanch"
669,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,friends.  Among the other nine original members of the club were Sir
670,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"Joshua Reynolds, the artist, and Edmund Burke, the noted statesman."
671,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,Before long _The Traveller_ and _The Deserted Village_ gave Goldsmith a
672,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"foremost place among the poets of the time, and _The Vicar of"
673,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"Wakefield_, published in 1776, brought him fame as a novelist.  This"
674,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"book remains to-day, after the lapse of nearly a century and a half,"
675,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"one of the most widely read of English novels.  Two comedies, _The"
676,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"Good-natured Man_ and _She Stoops to Conquer_, complete the list of his"
677,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"well-known works, while he wrote many others that were enjoyed by his"
678,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"contemporaries.  He died of a fever at the age of forty-six, and was"
679,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,buried in the burial ground of the Temple Church.  Two years later a
680,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,monument was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey.
681,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,
682,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,This short sketch of Goldsmith's life makes it clear that he lacked
683,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,strength of character and was wanting also in practical wisdom.  Even
684,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"after he became a successful author his extravagance kept him poor, and"
685,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,he died largely in debt.  Many stories are told illustrating his
686,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,innocent vanity and the love of gay clothing which made him conspicuous
687,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,even in an age of ruffled shirts and silver knee-buckles.  One of his
688,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,biographers describes him as arriving at a friend's house where he was
689,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"to dine, ""with his new wig, with his coat of Tyrian bloom and blue silk"
690,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"breeches, with a smart sword at his side, his gold-headed cane in his"
691,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"hand, and his hat under his elbow.""  But while he had more than his"
692,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"share of weaknesses, it must be granted that ""e'en his failings leaned"
693,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"to Virtue's side.""  He was sensitive, open-hearted, generous, and"
694,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,kindly--always ready to help those less fortunate than himself.  If in
695,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"Parson Primrose and in the ""village preacher"" of _The Deserted Village_"
696,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,"he has painted portraits of his father, the country curate, there is"
697,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,something of himself as well in these lovable characters.  Both in
698,OLIVER GOLDSMITH,poetry and in prose his style is easy and delightful; his humor has no

1627,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The white-washed wall, the nicely sanded floor,"
1628,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The varnished clock that clicked behind the door;
1629,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The chest contrived a double debt to pay,"
1630,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;             230"
1631,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The pictures placed for ornament and use,"
1632,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The twelve good rules,[20] the royal game of goose;"
1633,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The hearth, except when winter chilled the day,"
1634,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,With aspen boughs and flowers and fennel gay;
1635,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for shew,           235"
1636,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Ranged o'er the chimney, glistened in a row."
1637,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1638,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Vain transitory splendors! could not all
1639,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall?
1640,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Obscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart"
1641,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,An hour's importance to the poor man's heart.          240
1642,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Thither no more the peasant shall repair
1643,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To sweet oblivion of his daily care;
1644,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"No more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,"
1645,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,No more the woodman's ballad shall prevail;
1646,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"No more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,          245"
1647,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Relax his ponderous strength, and lean to hear;"
1648,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The host himself no longer shall be found
1649,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Careful to see the mantling bliss go round;
1650,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Nor the coy maid, half willing to be pressed,"
1651,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.             250
1652,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1653,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Yes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,"
1654,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,These simple blessings of the lowly train;
1655,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To me more dear, congenial to my heart,"
1656,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"One native charm, than all the gloss of art;"
1657,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Spontaneous joys, where Nature has its play,           255"
1658,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The soul adopts, and owns their firstborn sway;"
1659,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Lightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,"
1660,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Unenvied, unmolested, unconfined."
1661,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,"
1662,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,With all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayed--         260
1663,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"In these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,"
1664,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The toiling pleasure sickens into pain;
1665,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And, e'en while fashion's brightest arts decoy,"
1666,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The heart distrusting asks if this be joy.
1667,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1668,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Ye friends to truth, ye statesman who survey           265"
1669,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay,"
1670,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,'T is yours to judge how wide the limits stand
1671,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Between a splendid and an happy land.
1672,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,"
1673,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And shouting Folly hails them from her shore;          270
1674,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Hoards e'en beyond the miser's wish abound,[21]"
1675,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And rich men flock from all the world around.
1676,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Yet count our gains.  This wealth is but a name
1677,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,That leaves our useful products still the same.
1678,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Not so the loss.  The man of wealth and pride          275
1679,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Takes up a space that many poor supplied;
1680,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Space for his lake, his park's extended bounds,"
1681,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds:"
1682,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth
1683,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Has robbed the neighboring fields of half
1684,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,their growth;[22]                              280
1685,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"His seat, where solitary sports are seen,"
1686,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Indignant spurns the cottage from the green:
1687,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Around the world each needful product flies,"
1688,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,For all the luxuries the world supplies;
1689,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,While thus the land adorned for pleasure all           285
1690,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,In barren splendor feebly waits the fall.
1691,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1692,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"As some fair female unadorned and plain,"
1693,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Secure to please while youth confirms her reign,"
1694,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Slights every borrowed charm that dress supplies,"
1695,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes;           290
1696,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But when those charms are past, for charms are frail,"
1697,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"When time advances, and when lovers fail,"
1698,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"She then shines forth, solicitous to bless,"
1699,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,In all the glaring impotence of dress.
1700,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Thus fares the land by luxury betrayed:                295
1701,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"In nature's simplest charms at first arrayed,"
1702,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But verging to decline, its splendors rise;"
1703,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Its vistas strike, its palaces surprise:"
1704,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"While, scourged by famine from the smiling land,"
1705,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The mournful peasant leads his humble band,            300"
1706,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And while he sinks, without one arm to save,"
1707,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The country blooms--a garden and a grave.
1708,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1709,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where then, ah! where, shall poverty reside,"
1710,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To scape the pressure of contiguous pride?
1711,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,If to some common's fenceless limits strayed           305
1712,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"He drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,"
1713,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,"
1714,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And even the bare-worn common is denied.
1715,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1716,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,If to the city sped--what waits him there?
1717,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To see profusion that he must not share,               310"
1718,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To see ten thousand baneful arts combined
1719,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To pamper luxury, and thin mankind;[23]"
1720,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,To see those joys the sons of pleasure know
1721,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Extorted from his fellow-creature's woe.
1722,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Here while the courtier glitters in brocade,           315"
1723,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,There the pale artist plies the sickly trade;
1724,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Here while the proud their long-drawn pomps display,"
1725,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"There the black gibbet glooms beside the way,"
1726,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The dome where pleasure holds her midnight reign
1727,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Here, richly decked, admits the gorgeous train:        320"
1728,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,"
1729,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The rattling chariots clash, the torches glare."
1730,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Sure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy!
1731,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Sure these denote one universal joy!
1732,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Are these thy serious thoughts?--Ah, turn thine eyes   325"
1733,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Where the poor houseless shivering female lies.
1734,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"She once, perhaps, in village plenty blessed,"
1735,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Has wept at tales of innocence distressed;
1736,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Her modest looks the cottage might adorn,"
1737,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn:         330
1738,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Now lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,"
1739,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Near her betrayer's door she lays her head,"
1740,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And, pinched with cold, and shrinking from the shower,"
1741,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"With heavy heart deplores that luckless hour,"
1742,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"When idly first, ambitious of the town,                335"
1743,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,She left her wheel and robes of country brown.
1744,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1745,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Do thine, sweet Auburn,--thine, the loveliest train,--"
1746,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Do thy fair tribes participate[24] her pain?
1747,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Even now, perhaps, by cold and hunger led,"
1748,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,At proud men's doors they ask a little bread!          340
1749,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1750,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Ah, no! To distant climes, a dreary scene,"
1751,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where half the convex world intrudes between,"
1752,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,"
1753,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Where wild Altama[25] murmurs to their woe.
1754,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Far different there from all that charmed before       345
1755,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The various terrors of that horrid shore;
1756,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray,"
1757,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And fiercely shed intolerable day;
1758,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those matted woods, where birds forget to sing,"
1759,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,But silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;              350
1760,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Those poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crowned,"
1761,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Where the dark scorpion gathers death around;
1762,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Where at each step the stranger fears to wake
1763,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;
1764,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Where crouching tigers[26] wait their hapless prey,    355"
1765,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And savage men more murderous still than they;
1766,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"While oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,"
1767,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Mingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.
1768,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Far different these from every former scene,"
1769,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The cooling brook, the grassy vested green,            360"
1770,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The breezy covert of the warbling grove,"
1771,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,That only sheltered thefts of harmless love.
1772,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1773,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Good Heaven! what sorrows gloomed that parting day,"
1774,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,That called them from their native walks away;
1775,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"When the poor exiles, every pleasure past,             365"
1776,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Hung round the bowers, and fondly looked their last,"
1777,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And took a long farewell, and wished in vain"
1778,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"For seats like these beyond the western main,"
1779,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And shuddering still to face the distant deep,"
1780,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Returned and wept, and still returned to weep.         370"
1781,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,The good old sire the first prepared to go
1782,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To new found worlds, and wept for others' woe;"
1783,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"But for himself, in conscious virtue brave,"
1784,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,He only wished for worlds beyond the grave.
1785,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"His lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,            375"
1786,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"The fond companion of his helpless years,"
1787,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Silent went next, neglectful of her charms,"
1788,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And left a lover's for a father's arms.
1789,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"With louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,"
1790,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And blessed the cot where every pleasure rose,         380"
1791,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And kissed her thoughtless babes with many a tear,"
1792,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And clasped them close, in sorrow doubly dear,"
1793,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief
1794,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,In all the silent manliness of grief.
1795,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1796,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"O luxury! thou cursed by Heaven's decree,              385"
1797,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,How ill exchanged are things like these for thee!
1798,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"How do thy potions, with insidious joy,"
1799,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Diffuse their pleasure only to destroy!
1800,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Kingdoms by thee, to sickly greatness grown,"
1801,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Boast of a florid vigor not their own.                 390
1802,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"At every draught more large and large they grow,"
1803,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,A bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe;
1804,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Till sapped their strength, and every part unsound,"
1805,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Down, down they sink, and spread a ruin round."
1806,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1807,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Even now the devastation is begun,                     395"
1808,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,And half the business of destruction done;
1809,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Even now, methinks, as pondering here I stand,"
1810,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,I see the rural virtues leave the land.
1811,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail,"
1812,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"That idly waiting flaps with every gale,               400"
1813,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Downward they move, a melancholy band,"
1814,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Pass from the shore, and darken all the strand."
1815,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Contented toil, and hospitable care,"
1816,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And kind connubial tenderness, are there;"
1817,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And piety with wishes placed above,                    405"
1818,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And steady loyalty, and faithful love."
1819,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"And thou, sweet Poetry, thou loveliest maid,"
1820,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Still first to fly where sensual joys invade;
1821,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Unfit in these degenerate times of shame
1822,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"To catch the heart, or strike for honest fame;         410"
1823,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Dear charming nymph, neglected and decried,"
1824,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"My shame in crowds, my solitary pride;"
1825,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Thou source of all my bliss, and all my woe,"
1826,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"That found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me so;"
1827,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Thou guide by which the nobler arts excel,             415"
1828,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Thou nurse of every virtue, fare thee well!"
1829,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Farewell, and O! where'er thy voice be tried,"
1830,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"On Torno's cliffs,[27] or Pambamarca's side,[28]"
1831,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Whether where equinoctial fervors glow,"
1832,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Or winter wraps the polar world in snow,               420"
1833,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Still let thy voice, prevailing over time,"
1834,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Redress the rigors of the inclement clime;
1835,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain;
1836,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,Teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain;
1837,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Teach him, that states of native strength possessed,   425"
1838,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Though very poor, may still be very blest;"
1839,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"That trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay,"
1840,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,As ocean sweeps the labored mole[29] away;
1841,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"While self-dependent power can time defy,"
1842,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,As rocks resist the billows and the sky.               430

1847,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"popular, and to-day few English poems are so widely read or so often"
1848,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,quoted.  If the poet had in mind any special place when writing of
1849,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"""Sweet Auburn,"" it was probably Lissoy, in Ireland, where he grew up;"
1850,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"but the village of his imagination is lovelier than any actual spot,"

1858,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1859,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"[3.] One only master, etc.  Sometimes, in England or in Ireland a"
1860,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"wealthy man would buy a large tract of land, pull down the house and"
1861,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,turn the entire region into parks or hunting grounds.  Such a man was
1862,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,not necessarily a tyrant.  In many cases the villages demolished were
1863,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,deserted because the inhabitants had left them to seek more comfortable
1864,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,homes across the ocean.
1865,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1866,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"[4.] Decay, _i.e._ deteriorate, lose their high moral character."
1867,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Although this is not the inevitable consequence of great wealth, it is"
1868,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,certainly one of its dangers.
1869,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1870,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,[5.] A breath can make them.  Breath was used by older writers in the
1871,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"sense of words.  The poet's meaning is, that kings can easily make new"
1872,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,lords by conferring titles upon their favorites.  This was a common
1873,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"practice in former times.  Now, in England, titles are usually given as"
1874,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"a reward for distinguished merit, as in the case of Alfred Lord"
1875,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"Tennyson, the famous poet."
1876,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1877,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,[6.] Ere England's griefs began.  The student of history finds that
1878,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,there never was such a time.  Although there are serious evils in all
1879,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"civilized countries to-day, especially in the condition of the poorest"
1880,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"people in large cities, the workingman is, on the whole, far better off"

1894,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"said this, nevertheless it is true that the feeling of responsibility"
1895,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,for poor and the unfortunate was less widespread among the well-to-do
1896,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,in his day than it is now.
1897,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,
1898,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"[11.] The village preacher's, etc.  There is no doubt that the poet was"
1899,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,thinking of his own father when he drew the sketch that follows--one of
1900,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,the most charming character sketches in English literature.  To find
1901,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"its like in poetry one must go back to Chaucer's picture of the ""poor"
1902,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"parson"" in the _Prologue to the Canterbury Tales_.  Goldsmith's"

1912,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,"rather than from a religious, and perhaps a colder, sentiment."
1913,THE DESERTED VILLAGE,

1954,ROBERT BURNS,"Probably the poetry of ""Robbie Burns, the Ayrshire Ploughman,"" is known"
1955,ROBERT BURNS,to more English-speaking people than that of any other writer--not
1956,ROBERT BURNS,"excepting even Shakespeare, for many a person who never reads a book is"
1957,ROBERT BURNS,"familiar with _John Anderson_, _My Jo_, _Auld Lang Syne_, and _Bonie"
1958,ROBERT BURNS,"Doon_, though he may not know or care who wrote these famous songs."
1959,ROBERT BURNS,
1960,ROBERT BURNS,"The Scotch poet was born at Alloway in Ayrshire, where his father"
1961,ROBERT BURNS,cultivated a small farm.  He was the eldest of seven children.  Before
1962,ROBERT BURNS,"he was eight years old the family removed to Mt. Oliphant, and later to"
1963,ROBERT BURNS,"Lochlea.  Here, in 1784, the father died, worn out with incessant toil,"
1964,ROBERT BURNS,which ended only in disappointment.  The family were so poor that
1965,ROBERT BURNS,"Robert was obliged to work hard even when very young, and at fifteen he"
1966,ROBERT BURNS,was his father's chief helper.  In later years he described his life at
1967,ROBERT BURNS,"Mt. Oliphant as combining ""the cheerless gloom of a hermit with the"
1968,ROBERT BURNS,"unceasing moil of a galley slave.""  But poets are given to"
1969,ROBERT BURNS,"exaggeration, and doubtless the attractive picture of home life which"
1970,ROBERT BURNS,he afterwards painted in the _Cotter's Saturday Night_ is true in the
1971,ROBERT BURNS,main of the life in his father's cottage.
1972,ROBERT BURNS,
1973,ROBERT BURNS,"In his father, Burns was most fortunate, for he was a man of strict"
1974,ROBERT BURNS,"integrity, and strong religious faith.  The education of his children"
1975,ROBERT BURNS,"was, in his judgment, so important that when they were unable to attend"
1976,ROBERT BURNS,"school he taught them himself, notwithstanding his exhausting labors on"
1977,ROBERT BURNS,the farm.  The family as a whole were fond of reading.  Among their
1978,ROBERT BURNS,"books the poet mentions certain plays of Shakespeare, Pope's"
1979,ROBERT BURNS,"works,--including his translation of Homer,--the _Spectator_, Allan"
1980,ROBERT BURNS,"Ramsay's writings, and several volumes on religious and philosophical"
1981,ROBERT BURNS,subjects.  Probably in this list the Bible should stand first.  He
1982,ROBERT BURNS,himself studied the art of verse-making in a collection of songs.  He
1983,ROBERT BURNS,"says: ""I pored over them, driving my cart or walking to labor, song by"
1984,ROBERT BURNS,"song, carefully noting the true tender or sublime from affectation or"
1985,ROBERT BURNS,fustian.  I am convinced that I owe to this practice much of my
1986,ROBERT BURNS,"critic-craft, such as it is!""  His first song, composed when he was"
1987,ROBERT BURNS,"fifteen, was inspired by a young girl who worked at his side in the"
1988,ROBERT BURNS,harvest field.
1989,ROBERT BURNS,
1990,ROBERT BURNS,"Robert and his brother Gilbert had taken a farm at Mossgiel, not far"
1991,ROBERT BURNS,"away, while their father was still living, and after his death they"
1992,ROBERT BURNS,"removed there, taking with them the rest of the family.  Unfortunately"
1993,ROBERT BURNS,the farm did not prosper.  On reaching the age of twenty-seven the poet
1994,ROBERT BURNS,determined to go to Jamaica where he had been promised a position as
1995,ROBERT BURNS,overseer of an estate.  In order to raise money to pay his passage he
1996,ROBERT BURNS,"published a volume of poems.  The returns were small, but the fame of"
1997,ROBERT BURNS,the writer spread so rapidly that he was persuaded to remain in his own
1998,ROBERT BURNS,country and publish a second edition of his poems in Edinburgh.
1999,ROBERT BURNS,
2000,ROBERT BURNS,The two winters which he spent in the Scotch capital at this time form
2001,ROBERT BURNS,an interesting episode in his life.  He was the lion of the day in
2002,ROBERT BURNS,literary circles.  Many persons who met him have told how he impressed
2003,ROBERT BURNS,"them; but the most interesting account is that of Walter Scott, then a"
2004,ROBERT BURNS,"youth of sixteen.  He says of Burns: ""His person was strong and robust;"
2005,ROBERT BURNS,"his manner rustic, not clownish; a sort of dignified plainness and"
2006,ROBERT BURNS,simplicity.  His countenance was more massive than it looks in any of
2007,ROBERT BURNS,the portraits. . .  There was a strong expression of sense and
2008,ROBERT BURNS,"shrewdness in all his lineaments; the eye alone, I think, indicated the"
2009,ROBERT BURNS,"poetical character and temperament.  It was large, and of a dark cast,"
2010,ROBERT BURNS,"which glowed (I say literally glowed), when he spoke, with feeling or"
2011,ROBERT BURNS,"interest.  I never saw such another eye in a human head, though I have"
2012,ROBERT BURNS,"seen the most distinguished men of my time."""
2013,ROBERT BURNS,
2014,ROBERT BURNS,"In 1788 the poet married Jane Armour, and the following year settled"
2015,ROBERT BURNS,"with her on a farm at Ellisland, near Dumfries.  Finding it impossible"
2016,ROBERT BURNS,"to make a living for his increasing family as a farmer, he obtained"
2017,ROBERT BURNS,through friends the place of exciseman for the surrounding region.
2018,ROBERT BURNS,"This position obliged him to ride more than two hundred miles a week,"
2019,ROBERT BURNS,collecting government taxes.  In 1791 he moved to the town of Dumfries.
2020,ROBERT BURNS,The following year he came near losing his place through an act of
2021,ROBERT BURNS,indiscretion which proved him to be more poet than exciseman.  He
2022,ROBERT BURNS,bought four guns which had come into the possession of the government
2023,ROBERT BURNS,"through the seizure of a smuggling vessel, and sent them with"
2024,ROBERT BURNS,expressions of admiration and sympathy to the French Legislative
2025,ROBERT BURNS,Assembly.  These were the early days of the Revolution when young men
2026,ROBERT BURNS,in many parts of the world were enthusiastic in their support of the
2027,ROBERT BURNS,"movement.  Fortunately the guns failed to reach their destination, and"
2028,ROBERT BURNS,the poet having made his peace with the authorities kept his position
2029,ROBERT BURNS,until failing health obliged him to give it up.  During his later years
2030,ROBERT BURNS,"he wrote little but songs, and for these he would take no money,"
2031,ROBERT BURNS,"although he was, as ever, a poor man.  He died in 1796, at the age of"
2032,ROBERT BURNS,thirty-seven.  In 1815 his remains were transferred to a mausoleum
2033,ROBERT BURNS,built as a tribute to his genius.
2034,ROBERT BURNS,
2035,ROBERT BURNS,"As a man, Burns was far from perfect.  His passions were strong and he"
2036,ROBERT BURNS,"never learned to control them, and in consequence he had reason to"
2037,ROBERT BURNS,repent bitterly many a rash act.  Yet he was brave and honest; he had a
2038,ROBERT BURNS,"righteous hatred of hypocrisy; as the champion of the humble, he"
2039,ROBERT BURNS,claimed for the poorest the full privileges of sturdy manhood; he cared
2040,ROBERT BURNS,heartily for his fellowmen and had a place in his affections even for
2041,ROBERT BURNS,the field-mouse and the daisy.  Because his verse beats with the
2042,ROBERT BURNS,"passions of his fiery and sympathetic nature, the world loves him as it"
2043,ROBERT BURNS,loves few other poets.  Among the best known of his productions are
2044,ROBERT BURNS,"_The Cotter's Saturday Night_, _Tam o' Shanter_, _Address to the Unco"
2045,ROBERT BURNS,"Guid_, _To a Mouse_, and _To a Mountain Daisy_.  In speaking of his"
2046,ROBERT BURNS,"songs, one might mention first, _Scots Wha Hae_,--composed in the midst"
2047,ROBERT BURNS,"of tempests, while the poet was riding over a wild Galloway moor,--and"
2048,ROBERT BURNS,"next, _Highland Mary_ and _A Man's a Man for a' That_; but there is no"
2049,ROBERT BURNS,"need of enumerating the songs of Burns.  As Emerson has said, ""The wind"
2050,ROBERT BURNS,"whispers them, the birds whistle them, the corn, barley, and bulrushes"
2051,ROBERT BURNS,hoarsely rustle them. . . .  They are the property and the solace of
2052,ROBERT BURNS,"mankind."""

2475,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Coleridge was born in Ottery St. Mary, in Devonshire England, and spent"
2476,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"his early years in the midst of a large family.  His father, who was"
2477,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"vicar of the town and master of the grammar school, died when the son"
2478,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"was only nine years old.  His character must, however, have impressed"
2479,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Coleridge deeply, for he said, in after years: ""The memory of my"
2480,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"father--my reverend, kind, learned, simple-hearted father--is a"
2481,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"religion to me.""  Soon after his father's death he left his happy home"
2482,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"in the country to enter a school it=n London, known as Christ's"
2483,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Hospital.  Charles Lamb, who was a schoolmate of his, has sketched the"
2484,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"life there in two well-known essays.  In one of them, _Christ's"
2485,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Hospital Fifty Years Ago_, he describes the summer holidays, so"
2486,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"delightful for himself with his family near, and so dreary for the"
2487,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,country boy with no friends in the city; and he pictures Coleridge as
2488,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"forlorn and half-starved, declaring that in those days the food of the"
2489,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"""Blue-coat boys"" was cruelly insufficient.  From early childhood the"
2490,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"future poet had been passionately fond of reading, and an occurrence"
2491,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,which took place during his early years in London enabled him for a
2492,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"time to gratify his taste.  One day while walking down the Strand, he"
2493,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"put out his arms as if in the act of swimming, and in so doing touched"
2494,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"a passer-by.  The man, taking him for a thief, seized him, crying,"
2495,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"""What, so young and so wicked!""  ""I am not a pickpocket,"" replied the"
2496,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"boy; ""I only thought I was Leander swimming the Hellespont!""  After"
2497,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"making some inquiries, his chance acquaintance subscribed to a library"
2498,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"for him, and the story runs that in a short time the young bookworm had"
2499,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"read ""right through the catalogue."""
2500,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,
2501,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,In 1791 Coleridge entered Cambridge University.  While there he was
2502,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,deeply stirred by events in France--for the Revolution was in
2503,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,progress--and ran some risk of being expelled by the open expression of
2504,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"his radical views on politics.  His fine ode, _France_, written several"
2505,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"years later, was the expression of this intense interest.  During his"
2506,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"second year of study, while suffering from a fit of despondency, he"
2507,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"suddenly left the university--just why, no one knows--and went to"
2508,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,London.  There he enlisted in the 15th dragoons under the name of Silas
2509,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,Tompkyn Comberback.  While he was in the service his awkwardness in
2510,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"doing manual labor, especially in grooming his horse, led to his"
2511,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,exchanging tasks with his comrades: they performed his mechanical
2512,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"duties, while he wrote letters for them to their wives or sweethearts."
2513,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,A Latin inscription which he placed above his saddle in the stable led
2514,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"to the discovery of his true condition, and about the same time his"
2515,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,friends learned of his whereabouts.  At the end of four months in the
2516,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,dragoons he was bought out and enabled to return to his studies.  He
2517,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"remained in Cambridge but a short time, however, leaving in 1794"
2518,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,without taking a degree.
2519,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,
2520,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,The following year he married Miss Sara Fricker.  This important step
2521,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,was taken on the strength of a small sum promised by a bookseller for a
2522,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,volume of poems which he was then writing.  A month later his friend
2523,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,Robert Southey--afterwards well known as an author--married his wife's
2524,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"sister.  Some time before this, the two young men had conceived the"
2525,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,idea of crossing the sea with a few congenial acquaintances and forming
2526,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,an ideal community on the bank of the Susquehanna.  Fortunately the
2527,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,scheme was abandoned and the two dreamers turned their attention to
2528,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,literary projects.
2529,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,
2530,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Coleridge's best work as a poet was done in 1797 and 1798, and probably"
2531,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,the inspiration came largely from his friendship with William
2532,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,Wordsworth.  During these two years the poets lived near each other in
2533,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"the beautiful Cumberland country, and while taking long rambles over"
2534,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"the Quantock Hills they talked, planned, and wrote.  The first result"
2535,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,of this intercourse was a joint volume of poems called _Lyrical
2536,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Ballads_, published in 1798.  This included Coleridge's _Ancient"
2537,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,Mariner_ and Wordsworth's _We are Seven_.  About the same time
2538,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Coleridge wrote the first part of _Christabel_, the ode _France_,"
2539,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"_Kubla Khan_, and a few other well-known poems.  The impression which"
2540,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"he made at this period of his life upon Dorothy Wordsworth, the poet's"
2541,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"sister, was recorded by her in a letter.  She says of him: ""He is a"
2542,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,wonderful man.  His conversation teems with soul and mind. . . .  His
2543,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"eye is large and full, and not very dark but gray, such an eye as would"
2544,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,receive from a heavy soul the dullest expression; but it speaks every
2545,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,emotion of his animated mind; it has more of the poet's eye in a fine
2546,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,frenzy rolling than I ever witnessed.  He has fine dark eyebrows and an
2547,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"overhanging forehead."""
2548,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,
2549,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Of Coleridge as poet there is unfortunately little more to relate, for"
2550,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,during the remainder of his life he devoted himself mainly to
2551,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"philosophy and literary criticism, with occasional work in journalism."
2552,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,After a stay in Germany he brought back to England a knowledge of
2553,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,German metaphysics and an enthusiasm for German literature which
2554,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,enabled him to do much towards awakening in his own countrymen an
2555,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"interest in these subjects.  He had never been strong, and from the age"
2556,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,of thirty-four he suffered seriously from ill-health and from his
2557,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,practice of using opium--a habit begun by his taking the dangerous drug
2558,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,to relieve acute pain.  No doubt his powers were impaired by these
2559,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"causes.  In 1804, hoping to benefit by change of climate, he went to"
2560,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Malta, and before his return spent some months in Italy.  With the"
2561,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"exception of a short tour on the Rhine with the Wordsworths, the last"
2562,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"sixteen years of his life were passed quietly at Highgate, a village"
2563,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"near London, where through the kind care of friends he was enabled to"
2564,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,control the opium habit and do a fair amount of intellectual work.  His
2565,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"mind dwelt much on religious subjects, and the faith which had earlier"
2566,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,found expression in his noble _Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni_ brought
2567,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,light and consolation as the end drew near.  Many young men came to see
2568,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"him during these last years, drawn by his fame as a poet and still more"
2569,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,by his remarkable powers as a talker.  One of them has said of him in
2570,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"this connection: ""Throughout a long summer's day would this man talk to"
2571,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"you in low, equable, but clear and musical tones, concerning things"
2572,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"human and divine.""  And the same person has described a day spent with"
2573,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"him as ""a Sabbath past expression, deep, tranquil, and serene.""  The"
2574,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"poet died at Highgate in 1834, at the age of sixty-two."
2575,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,
2576,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"Coleridge was a many-sided genius, and perhaps the world has benefited"
2577,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,as largely by his powers as a thinker as by his gift for poetry.  He
2578,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"did much both by talking and writing to broaden English thought, and"
2579,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"his keen and suggestive criticism of other authors, of Shakespeare"
2580,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,"especially, has been of high value to lovers of literature.  As a poet"
2581,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,he is distinguished for the rare quality of his imagination and the
2582,SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE,wonderful music of his verse.

2588,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,
2589,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"Three guests were on their way to a wedding, when one of them--the"
2590,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,bridegroom's nearest relative--was stopped by a Mariner with long gray
2591,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"beard and glittering eye, who constrained him to listen to his story."
2592,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,The Mariner once set sail in a ship bound southward.  After crossing
2593,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,the equator the vessel was driven by strong winds toward the south
2594,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"pole, and was finally hemmed in by icebergs.  An albatross which"
2595,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,appeared at this time brought good luck: the ice split and the ship
2596,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"sailed northward.  The Mariner, for no apparent reason, shot the bird"
2597,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,of good omen.  At first his comrades declared that he had done a
2598,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"hellish deed, but when the fog cleared away they justified him,"
2599,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,believing that the fog had been brought by the bird.  In this way they
2600,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,became accomplices in his crime.  By killing the albatross the Mariner
2601,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"had offended the Spirit of the South Pole, who now followed the ship"
2602,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"""nine fathom deep"" to make sure that vengeance was meted out to the"
2603,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,guilty man.  As a sign of the Mariner's guilt the sailors fastened
2604,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,about his neck the dead bird.  The vessel was now in the Pacific Ocean.
2605,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"On nearing the equator she was becalmed, and before long all the"
2606,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,sailors were dying of thirst.  Suddenly a skeleton ship appeared in
2607,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"sight, having on board Death and Life-in-Death.  The two spectres were"
2608,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,throwing dice to see which should possess the doomed Mariner.
2609,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"Life-in-Death won, and the Mariner was hers.  If Death had won, his"
2610,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"life would soon have ended; as it was, existence for him was to"
2611,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,mean--for a time at least--life in the midst of the dead.  No sooner
2612,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"had the spectre bark shot by than his comrades, four times fifty living"
2613,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"men, dropped lifeless one by one.  For seven days and seven nights he"
2614,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,suffered agonies from the curse in their stony eyes; but he could not
2615,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"die, and he could not pray."
2616,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,
2617,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"One day, while watching some water snakes at play, he was charmed with"
2618,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,their beauty and blessed them unawares--a sure sign that love for God's
2619,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,lower creatures was springing up in his heart.  The next instant the
2620,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,spell began to break: the albatross fell from his neck into the sea and
2621,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"he could move his lips in prayer.  He slept, and the Holy Mother sent"
2622,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,rain; and when he awoke the wind was blowing.  A troop of angelic
2623,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,spirits now entered the bodies of the dead sailors and worked the
2624,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"ropes, and, obedient to the angels, the Spirit of the South Pole helped"
2625,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"the ship onward.  As she sped on, the Mariner, who lay in a swoon,"
2626,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,learned from the talk of two spirits that his penance was not yet
2627,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,accomplished.  Soon after waking he beheld the shores of his native
2628,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,country.  As the vessel neared the land the angels left the bodies of
2629,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"the sailors, and at the same time a small boat approached bringing a"
2630,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"pilot and his boy, and a pious hermit--all known to the Mariner."
2631,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"Suddenly there was a dreadful sound, and the ship sank.  On coming to"
2632,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,his senses the Mariner found himself in the pilot's boat.  When the
2633,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"hermit asked him, ""What manner of man art thou?"" his agony was fearful"
2634,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,until he had found relief in telling his experience.  As a punishment
2635,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,for his crime in shooting the albatross the agony was to return at
2636,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,intervals and compel him to travel from land to land relating his
2637,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,strange tale.  After admonishing the wedding guest to love well both
2638,ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENT MARINER,"man and beast, the ancient Mariner departed.  The poet says of his"

3376,PART VII,
3377,PART VII,"""I moved my lips --the Pilot shrieked                  560"

3459,PART VII,
3460,PART VII,NOTE.--The Ancient Mariner was written in 1797.  The plot was suggested
3461,PART VII,by a dream related to Coleridge by one of his friends.  While the story
3462,PART VII,"is his own invention, he took several points from Shelvocke's Voyages"
3463,PART VII,"and accepted a few hints from Wordsworth, who furnished also two or"
3464,PART VII,three lines of verse.  In the beginning the two poets intended to work
3465,PART VII,"together, but this plan was found impracticable, and Coleridge"
3466,PART VII,proceeded by himself.  It is easy to believe that the plot originated
3467,PART VII,"in a dream, for the completed poem is one of the strangest, most"
3468,PART VII,fantastic dreams that ever formed themselves in a poet's brain.  So far
3469,PART VII,"as its moral import is concerned, the production will hardly bear close"
3470,PART VII,"scrutiny, although it teaches the duty of loving all God's creatures,"
3471,PART VII,both great and small.  The prolonged suffering of the Mariner is a
3472,PART VII,"punishment far too severe for his thoughtless act, while his four times"
3473,PART VII,"fifty comrades, who endure horrible tortures before dying, have been"
3474,PART VII,guilty of no crime whatsoever.  Still it is not necessary that every
3475,PART VII,"piece of literature should teach a consistent moral lesson, and _The"
3476,PART VII,Ancient Mariner_ can be enjoyed for its marvelous pictures and its
3477,PART VII,weird melody.
3478,PART VII,
3479,PART VII,"The form chosen by Coleridge for his production, that of the mediaeval"
3480,PART VII,"ballad, is peculiarly adapted to story-telling on account of the"
3481,PART VII,"freedom which it allows, and it has never been more artistically used"
3482,PART VII,than in this instance.  In harmony with the ballad form the poet uses
3483,PART VII,"certain old words, such as ""trow,"" ""wist,"" and ""countree.""  It will be"
3484,PART VII,"seen that the stanzas vary in length, and that there are occasional"
3485,PART VII,irregularities in metre.  In general the first and third lines of a
3486,PART VII,"stanza have four feet each, while the second and fourth lines have"
3487,PART VII,"three feet.  Only the second and fourth lines rhyme, unless the stanza"
3488,PART VII,consists of more than four lines.
3489,PART VII,

3505,PART VII,[7.] The Sun came up upon the left.  This would be the case if a vessel
3506,PART VII,"were going from England, for instance, toward the equator; and each day"
3507,PART VII,the sun would be more nearly overhead.
3508,PART VII,

3526,PART VII,
3527,PART VII,"[15.] Vespers nine, _i.e._ nine evenings.  _Vesper_ and _Hesperus_ are"
3528,PART VII,"names given to the evening star, especially to the planet Venus when it"

3530,PART VII,other meanings of the word _vesper_.
3531,PART VII,
3532,PART VII,"[16.] Whiles, meanwhile."
3533,PART VII,
3534,PART VII,[17.] The Sun now rose upon the right.  This indicates that the vessel
3535,PART VII,had turned about and was going northward.  The poet says in his notes
3536,PART VII,that she soon entered the Pacific Ocean.
3537,PART VII,
3538,PART VII,"[18.] Nor dim nor red, etc.  The sun now rose clear and bright, and not"
3539,PART VII,"dim or red, as when seen through mist or fog; and the sailors justified"
3540,PART VII,"the Mariner, thinking that by his act the fog had been dispersed."
3541,PART VII,Uprist means _uprose_.
3542,PART VII,

3547,PART VII,
3548,PART VII,[21.] Death-fires.  There is a superstition that death is sometimes
3549,PART VII,foreshadowed by death-fires or fetch-lights.  In this instance the
3550,PART VII,fires presaged the death of the sailors.
3551,PART VII,
3552,PART VII,"[22.] The spirit that plagued us so.  This was ""the lonesome spirit"

3573,PART VII,
3574,PART VII,[31.] The Nightmare Life-in-Death.  In this strange being the poet
3575,PART VII,"personifies the state of a person who lives, as it were, in the shadow"
3576,PART VII,"of death.  The condition called ""nightmare"" was formerly believed to be"
3577,PART VII,"caused by the witch Nightmare, who oppressed people during sleep."
3578,PART VII,
3579,PART VII,[32.] At one stride comes the dark.  This is a wonderful picture of the
3580,PART VII,"sudden fall of night near the equator, where there is no twilight."

3582,PART VII,"[33.] Clomb, climbed; an old form."
3583,PART VII,
3584,PART VII,"[34.] The horned moon, etc.  Coleridge says in a note: ""It is a common"

3586,PART VII,"whenever a star dogs the moon."""
3587,PART VII,
3588,PART VII,[35.] I fear thee.  The wedding guest imagined that the Mariner died
3589,PART VII,with the rest of the sailors and that he was talking with a ghost.
3590,PART VII,
3591,PART VII,"[36.] And thou art long, etc.  This line and the line following were"
3592,PART VII,written by Wordsworth.
3593,PART VII,
