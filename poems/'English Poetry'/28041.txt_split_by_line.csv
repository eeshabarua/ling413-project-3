142,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,THE LIFE OF BROWNING
143,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
144,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
145,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Robert Browning, the poet, was the third of that name. The first Robert"
146,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning, a man of energy and ability, held an important post in the"
147,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Bank of England. His wife, Margaret Tittle, was a Creole from the West"
148,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Indies, and at the time of her marriage her property was still in the"
149,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"estates owned by her father near St. Kitts. When their son, the second"
150,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Robert, was seven years of age, his mother died, and his father"
151,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,afterwards married again. The second wife's ascendency over her husband
152,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,was unfortunately exerted against the best interests of the son. His
153,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"desire to become an artist, his wish for a university training, were"
154,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"disregarded, and he was sent instead to St. Kitts, where he was given"
155,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,employment on his mother's sugar plantations. The breach between Robert
156,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,and his father became absolute when the boy defied local prejudice by
157,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"teaching a negro to read, and when, because of what his father"
158,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"considered a sentimental objection to slavery, he finally refused to"
159,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,remain in the West Indies. The young man returned to England and at
160,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,twenty-two started on an independent career as a clerk in the Bank of
161,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,England. In 1811 he married Sarah Anne Wiedemann. They settled in
162,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Camberwell, London, where Robert, the poet, was born, May 7, 1812, and"
163,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,his sister Sarianna in 1814.
164,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
165,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning's father was a competent official in the Bank and a successful
166,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"business man, but his tastes were æsthetic and literary, and his"
167,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,leisure time was accordingly devoted to such pursuits as the collection
168,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,of old books and manuscripts. He also read widely in both classic and
169,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"modern literatures. The first book of the _Iliad_ he knew by heart, and"
170,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"all the _Odes_ of Horace, and he was accustomed to soothe his child to"
171,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"sleep by humming to him snatches of Anacreon to the tune of ""A Cottage"
172,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"in the Wood."" Mr. Browning had also considerable skill in two realms of"
173,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"art, for he drew vigorous portraits and caricatures, and he had, even"
174,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"according to his son's mature judgment, extraordinary force and facility"
175,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"in verse-making. In character he was serene, lovable, gentle,"
176,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""tenderhearted to a fault."" So instinctively chivalrous was he that"
177,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"there was ""no service which the ugliest, oldest, crossest woman in the"
178,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"world might not have exacted of him."" He was a man of great physical"
179,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"vigor, dying at the age of eighty-four without ever having been ill."
180,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
181,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning's mother was the daughter of William Wiedemann, a German who"
182,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,had settled in Dundee and married a Scotch wife. Mrs. Browning impressed
183,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,all who knew her by her sweetness and goodness. Carlyle spoke of her as
184,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""the true type of a Scottish gentlewoman""; her son's friend, Mr. Kenyon,"
185,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"said that such as she had no need to go to heaven, because they made it"
186,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"wherever they were; and her son called her ""a divine woman."" She had"
187,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,deep religious instincts and concerned herself particularly with her
188,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,son's moral and spiritual development. The bond between them was always
189,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"very strong, and when she died in 1849 his wife wrote, ""He has loved his"
190,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"mother as such passionate natures can love, and I never saw a man so"
191,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"bowed down in an extremity of sorrow--never."""
192,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
193,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Robert Browning's childhood was passed in an unusually serene and happy
194,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"home. In _Development_ he tells how, at five years of age, he was made"
195,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,to understand the main facts of the Trojan War by his father's clever
196,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"use of the cat, the dogs, the pony in the stable, and the page-boy, to"
197,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,impersonate the heroes of that ancient conflict. Latin declensions were
198,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,taught the child by rhymes concocted by his father as memory-easing
199,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,devices. Stories and even lessons were made intelligible and vivid by
200,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"colored maps and comic drawings. Until the boy was fourteen, his"
201,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"schooling was of the most casual sort, his only formal training being"
202,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,such as he received in the comparatively unimportant three or four years
203,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"he spent, after he was ten, at Mr. Ready's private school. His real"
204,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"education came, through all his early life, from his home. What would"
205,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,now be called nature-study he pursued ardently and on his own initiative
206,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,in the home garden and neighboring fields. His love for animals was
207,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"inherited from his mother and fostered by her. He used to keep, says"
208,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Mrs. Orr in her account of his life, ""owls and monkeys, magpies and"
209,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"hedge-hogs, an eagle, and even a couple of large snakes, constantly"
210,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,bringing home the more portable animals in his pockets and transferring
211,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"them to his mother for immediate care."" Browning says that his faculty"
212,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,of observation at this time would not have disgraced a Seminole Indian.
213,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,In the matter of reading he was not entirely without advice and
214,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"guidance, but was, on the whole, allowed unusual freedom of choice. He"
215,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"afterwards told Mrs. Orr that Milton, Quarles, Voltaire, Mandeville, and"
216,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Horace Walpole were the authors in whom, as a boy, he particularly"
217,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,delighted. His love for art was established and developed by visits to
218,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the Dulwich picture gallery, of which he afterwards wrote to Miss"
219,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Barrett with ""love and gratitude"" because he had been allowed to go"
220,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"there before the age prescribed by the rules, and had thus learned to"
221,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"know ""a wonderful Rembrandt,"" a Watteau, ""three triumphant Murillos,"" a"
222,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Giorgione Music Lesson, and various Poussins. His marked early"
223,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,susceptibility to music is evidenced by an incident narrated by Mr.
224,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Sharp: ""One afternoon his mother was playing in the twilight to herself."
225,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,She was startled to hear a sound behind her. Glancing round she beheld a
226,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"little white figure distinct against an oak bookcase, and could just"
227,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,discern two large wistful eyes looking earnestly at her. The next moment
228,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the child had sprung into her arms, sobbing passionately at he knew not"
229,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"what, but, as his paroxysm subsided, whispering with shy urgency: 'Play!"
230,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Play!'"""
231,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
232,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,In various ways the boy Robert was noticeably precocious. He could not
233,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"remember a time, he said, when he did not rhyme, and his sister records"
234,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"that as a very little boy he used to walk around the table ""spanning out"
235,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"on the smooth mahogany the scansion of verses he had composed."" Some of"
236,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"these early lines he could recall and he could recall, too, the"
237,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"prodigious satisfaction with which he uttered them, especially the"
238,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,sentence he put into the mouth of a man who had just committed
239,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"murder--""Now my soul is satisfied."" At twelve he had a volume named"
240,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,_Incondita_ ready for publication. To discerning eyes the little volume
241,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"was a production of great promise, dominated though it was by the"
242,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"influence of his father's idol, Pope, and of his own temporary ruling"
243,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"deity, Byron. But a publisher was not found, and in later years, at"
244,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning's request, the two extant manuscript copies of _Incondita_ were"
245,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"destroyed, along with many others of his youthful poems that had been"
246,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,preserved by his father.
247,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
248,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning's early tastes in the realm of poetry were, on the whole,"
249,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"romantic. ""Now here is the truth,"" he wrote to Miss Barrett, ""the first"
250,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,book I ever bought in my life was Ossian--and years before that the
251,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,first _composition_ I ever was guilty of was something in _imitation_ of
252,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Ossian whom I had not read, but _conceived_, through two or three"
253,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"scraps in other books."" But the decisive literary influence was yet to"
254,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,come. When he was fourteen he happened to see on a bookstall a volume
255,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"marked, ""Mr. Shelley's Atheistical Poem. Very Scarce""; and he at once"
256,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,wished to know more of this Mr. Shelley. After a perplexing search his
257,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"mother found the desired poems, most of them in first editions, at the"
258,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Olliers, Vere Street, London. She took home also three volumes by"
259,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"another poet, John Keats, who, she was told, was the subject of an elegy"
260,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,by Shelley. Browning never forgot the May evening when he first read
261,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"these new books, to the accompaniment, he said, of two nightingales, one"
262,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"in a copper-beech, one in a laburnum, each striving to outdo the other"
263,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,in melody. A new imaginative world was opened to the boy. In
264,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,_Memorabilia_ he afterwards recorded the strong intellectual and
265,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"emotional excitement, the thrill and ecstasy of this poetical"
266,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,experience. To Shelley especially did he give immediate and fervid
267,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"personal loyalty, even to the extent of endeavoring to follow him in"
268,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""atheism"" and vegetarianism."
269,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
270,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,When at fourteen the boy left Mr. Ready's school it was decided that his
271,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,further education should be carried on at home under private tutors. He
272,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"studied music under able masters, one in thorough-bass, and one in"
273,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"execution. He played and sang, and he composed spirited settings for"
274,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"songs. He read voraciously. He took lessons in dancing, riding, boxing,"
275,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"and fencing, and is said to have shown himself exceptionally active and"
276,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"vigorous. He kept up his interest in art, and he practiced drawing from"
277,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,casts. He found time also for various friendships. For Miss Eliza and
278,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Miss Sarah Flower, two sisters, nine and seven years his senior, he had"
279,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"a deep affection. Both young ladies were gifted in music, and this was"
280,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,one source of their attractions for the music-loving boy. Miss Sarah
281,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Flower wrote sacred hymns, the best known of which is ""Nearer my God to"
282,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Thee,"" and her sister composed music which Browning, even in his mature"
283,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"years, ranked as of especial significance. Other friends of this period"
284,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"were Joseph Arnold, afterwards Chief Justice of Bombay, and a man of"
285,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"great ability; Alfred Domett, a striking and interesting personality"
286,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"described by Browning in a poem beginning ""What's Become of Waring,"" and"
287,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"referred to in ""The Guardian Angel""; and the three Silverthorne boys,"
288,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"his cousins, the death of one of whom was the occasion of the poem ""May"
289,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"and Death."""
290,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
291,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"In spite of friends, a beautiful home, and congenial work, this period"
292,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,of home tutelage does not seem to have been altogether happy. His sister
293,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"in commenting on this period said, ""The fact was, poor boy, he had"
294,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"outgrown his social surroundings. They were absolutely good, but they"
295,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"were narrow; it could not be otherwise; he chafed under them."""
296,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Furthermore, the youth, before he had found his real work as a poet, was"
297,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"restless, irritable, and opinionated; and an ever-present cause of"
298,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,friction was the fact that there were few subjects of taste on which he
299,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,and his father did not disagree. Their poetic tastes were especially at
300,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"variance. The father counted Pope supreme in poetry, and it was many"
301,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,years before he could take pleasure in the form in which his son's
302,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"genius expressed itself. All the more noteworthy, then, is the"
303,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,generosity with which Mr. Browning looked after his son's interests
304,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"through the unprofitable early years of his poetic career, a generosity"
305,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,never lost sight of by the son. Mr. Sharp in his _Life of Browning_
306,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,records some words uttered by Mr. Browning a week or two before his
307,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"death, which show how permanent was his sense of indebtedness to his"
308,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"father. ""It would have been quite unpardonable in my case,"" he said,"
309,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""not to have done my best. My dear father put me in a condition most"
310,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,favorable for the best work I was capable of. When I think of the many
311,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,authors who have had to fight their way through all sorts of
312,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"difficulties, I have no reason to be proud of my achievements.... He"
313,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,secured for me all the care and comfort that a literary man needs to do
314,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,good work. It would have been shameful if I had not done my best to
315,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"realize his expectations of me."""
316,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
317,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"After it was determined that Robert should ""commence poet,"" he and his"
318,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,father came to the conclusion that a university training had many
319,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"elements foreign to the aim the youth had set before him, and that a"
320,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,richer and more directly available preparation could be gained from
321,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""sedulous cultivation of the powers of his mind"" at home, and from"
322,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""seeing life in the best sense"" at home and abroad. Mrs. Orr tells us"
323,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,that the first qualifying step of the zealous young poet was to read and
324,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,digest the whole of Dr. Johnson's _Dictionary_.
325,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
326,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning's first published poem, _Pauline_, appeared anonymously in"
327,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"January, 1833, when he was twenty years old. This poem is of especial"
328,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,autobiographical interest. Its enthusiastic praise of Shelley recalls
329,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"his early devotion to that poet, and in many scattered passages we find"
330,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,references to his own personality or experiences. The following lines
331,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,show with what intensity he recreated the lives and scenes in the books
332,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,he read:
333,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
334,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,And I myself went with the tale--a god
335,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Wandering after beauty, or a giant"
336,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Standing vast in the sunset--an old hunter
337,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Talking with gods, or a high-crested chief"
338,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Sailing with troops of friends to Tenedos.
339,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"I tell you, naught has ever been so clear"
340,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"As the place, the time, the fashion of those lives:"
341,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"I had not seen a work of lofty art,"
342,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Nor woman's beauty, nor sweet nature's face,"
343,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Yet, I say, never morn broke clear as those"
344,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"On the dim clustered isles in the blue sea,"
345,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,The deep groves and white temples and wet caves;
346,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,And nothing ever will surprise me now--
347,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Who stood beside the naked Swift-footed,"
348,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Who bound my forehead with Proserpine's hair.
349,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
350,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,There is true and powerful self-analysis in the lines beginning:
351,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
352,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,I am made up of an intensest life;
353,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
354,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,and the invocation in lines 811-854 reveals the passionately religious
355,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,nature of the young poet. In _The Early Writings of Robert Browning_[1]
356,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Mr. Gosse gives an account of the impression made by this poem upon men
357,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"so diverse as the Rev. William Johnson Fox, John Stuart Mill, and Dante"
358,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Gabriel Rossetti, to all of whom, in spite of its crudities and very"
359,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"evident immaturity, it seemed a production of exceptional promise."
360,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
361,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"After an interval of two years Browning published, this time under his"
362,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"own name, a second long poem. The subject, Paracelsus, had been"
363,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"suggested by the friend, Amédeé de Ripert-Monclar, to whom the poem is"
364,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,dedicated. In pursuance of his purposed rehabilitation of a vanished age
365,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning made extensive researches in the British Museum into the
366,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"history of Paracelsus, the great leader in sixteenth century medical"
367,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,science; but in the poem the facts are subordinated to a minute analysis
368,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,of the spiritual history of Paracelsus. The poem was too abstruse in
369,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"subject and style to bring Browning popularity, but his genius was"
370,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"recognized by important critics, and, though he was but twenty-three, he"
371,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,was admitted into the foremost literary circles of London. One of
372,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"his most distinguished new friends was Mr. Macready, the great actor. It"
373,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"was at his house that Browning first met Mr. Forster, who had already"
374,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"written favorable critiques of _Paracelsus_, one for _The Examiner_ and"
375,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,one for _The New Monthly Magazine_. Other literary associates of this
376,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"period were Leigh Hunt, Barry Cornwall, Sergeant Talfourd, Dickens, and"
377,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Walter Savage Landor. There were not infrequent dinners and suppers to
378,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,which the young poet was welcomed. He is described as being at this
379,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"period singularly handsome. ""He looks and acts,"" said Mr. Macready,"
380,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""more like a youthful poet than any man I ever saw."" He had"
381,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"sculpturesque masses of dark wavy hair, a skin like delicate ivory,"
382,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"deep-set, expressive eyes, and a sensitive mouth. He was slender,"
383,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"graceful, and most attractive in manner, and he was something of a dandy"
384,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,in his attention to dress. He is said to have made an especially good
385,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,impression on one occasion when the circumstances must have been as
386,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"trying as they were exhilarating. In May, 1836, a group of poets had"
387,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,assembled at Mr. Talfourd's to celebrate Macready's successful
388,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"production of Talfourd's _Ion_. Browning sat opposite Macready, who was"
389,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"between Wordsworth and Landor. When Talfourd proposed a toast, ""The"
390,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Poets of England,"" he spoke in complimentary terms of Wordsworth and"
391,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Landor, but called for a response from ""the youngest of the Poets of"
392,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"England, the author of _Paracelsus_."" Landor raised his cup to the young"
393,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"man, and Wordsworth shook hands with him across the table, saying, ""I am"
394,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"proud to know you, Mr. Browning."""
395,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
396,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning's third literary venture was a tragedy, _Strafford_, dedicated"
397,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"to Macready, at whose request it was written. The drama presents the"
398,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"impeachment, condemnation, and execution of the Earl of Strafford, a"
399,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"statesman who, according to the play, loved the unworthy King Charles"
400,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the First and sacrificed everything, even to life itself, in his blind"
401,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,loyalty to a master who treacherously deserted him in the hour of need.
402,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"It was a topic to which Browning had already given much thought, for he"
403,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"had the preceding year completed, from materials supplied by Mr. John"
404,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Forster, a _Life of Strafford_ begun by Forster for Lardner's _Eminent"
405,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,British Statesmen_.[2] The question of the historic truthfulness of the
406,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,drama is discussed by the historian Gardiner in the Introduction to Miss
407,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Emily H. Hickey's edition of _Strafford_. He shows that the play is in
408,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"its details and ""even in the very roots of the situation"" untrue to"
409,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"fact, and yet he maintains that in the chief characters there is"
410,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"essential truth of conception. ""Every time that I read the play,"" says"
411,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Gardiner, ""I feel more certain that Browning has seized the real"
412,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Strafford ... Charles, too, with his faults, perhaps exaggerated, is"
413,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"nevertheless the real Charles."" The play was produced at Covent Garden"
414,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Theater in May, 1837, with Macready as Strafford and Miss Helen Faucit"
415,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"as Lady Carlisle, and was successful in spite of poor scenery and"
416,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,costuming and poor acting in some of the parts. But owing to the
417,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,financial condition of the theater and the consequent withdrawal of one
418,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"of the important actors after the fifth night, the play had but a brief"
419,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,run. It was presented again in 1886 under the auspices of the Browning
420,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Society, and its power as an acting play ""surprised and impressed"" the"
421,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,audience.
422,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
423,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Before the composition of _Strafford_ Browning had begun a long poem,"
424,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"_Sordello_, which he completed after his first visit to Italy in 1838,"
425,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"and published in 1840. No one of his poems is more difficult to read,"
426,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,and many are the stories told of the dismay occasioned by its various
427,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,perplexities. The effect of this poem on Browning's fame was disastrous.
428,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"In fact, after _Sordello_ there began a period, twenty years long, of"
429,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,almost complete indifference in England to Browning's work. The
430,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,enthusiasm over the promise of his early poems died quite away. Late in
431,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,life Mr. Browning commented on this period of his literary career as a
432,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"time of ""prolonged desolateness."" Yet the years 1841-1846 are the years"
433,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"in which he attained his poetic maturity, and years in which he did some"
434,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,of his best work. During this period he brought out the series somewhat
435,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,fancifully called _Bells and Pomegranates_. The phrase itself comes from
436,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"_Exodus_ xxviii, 33, 34. As a title Browning explained it to mean"
437,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""something like a mixture of music with discoursing, sound with sense,"
438,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"poetry with thought."" This cheap serial edition, the separate numbers of"
439,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"which sold at first at sixpence and later at half a crown, included"
440,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"_Pippa Passes_, _King Victor and King Charles_, _Dramatic Lyrics_, _The"
441,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Return of the Druses_, _A Blot in the 'Scutcheon_, _Colombe's Birthday_,"
442,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"_Dramatic Romances and Lyrics_, _Luria_, and _A Soul's Tragedy_."
443,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
444,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,All of Browning's plays except _Strafford_ and _In a Balcony_ came out
445,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"of this series. The most beautiful of them all, _Pippa Passes_, appeared"
446,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"in 1841. It is hardly a drama at all in the conventional sense, though"
447,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"it has one scene, that between Ottima and Sebald, of the highest"
448,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,dramatic power; but it has always been a favorite with readers. When it
449,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,was published Miss Barrett wrote to Mr. Browning that she found it in
450,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,her heart to covet the authorship of this poem more than any other of
451,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"his works, and he said in answer that he, too, liked _Pippa_ better than"
452,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"anything else he had yet done. Mr. Sharp, while emphasizing the"
453,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"undramatic quality of the play, counts it ""the most imperishable because"
454,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the most nearly immaculate of Browning's dramatic poems."" ""It seems to"
455,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"me,"" he adds, ""like all simple and beautiful things, profound enough"
456,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,for the sinking plummet of the most curious explorer of the depths of
457,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"life. It can be read, re-read, learned by heart, and the more it is"
458,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,known the wider and more alluring are the avenues of imaginative thought
459,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"which it discloses. It has, more than any other long composition by its"
460,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"author, that quality of symmetry, that _symmetria prisca_ recorded of"
461,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Leonardo da Vinci in the Latin epitaph of Platino Piatto; and, as might"
462,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"be expected, its mental basis, what Rossetti called fundamental brain"
463,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"work, is as luminous, depth within depth, as the morning air...."
464,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Everyone who knows Browning at all knows _Pippa Passes_."""
465,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
466,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Of the seven dramas published in _Bells and Pomegranates_ there is
467,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,comparatively little stage history to record. In spite of occasional
468,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,fairly successful productions it must be admitted that Browning's plays
469,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"have never achieved, probably never will achieve, popularity in the"
470,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"shape of long runs in many cities.[3] They are too subjective, too"
471,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"analytic, too psychological, for quick or easy understanding. But to the"
472,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"reader they offer many delights. The stories are clear, coherent,"
473,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,interesting; the characters strongly individualized; the crises of
474,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,experience stimulating; the interaction of personalities subtly
475,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,analyzed; the poetry noble and beautiful.
476,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
477,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,The two non-dramatic numbers of _Bells and Pomegranates_ were _Dramatic
478,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Lyrics_ (No. 3, 1842) and _Dramatic Romances and Lyrics_ (No. 7, 1845)."
479,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"The first included such poems as ""Cavalier Tunes,"" ""In a Gondola,"""
480,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""Porphyria,"" and ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin""; the second included ""How"
481,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"they Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix,"" ""The Lost Leader,"" ""The"
482,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Tomb at St. Praxed's,"" ""The Flight of the Duchess,"" ""The Boy and the"
483,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Angel,"" and the first part of ""Saul."" These poems, together with the"
484,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"dramas, make a remarkably rich body of poetry to be produced in the"
485,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"short space of five years. And the character of the work, its variety"
486,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"and beauty and strength and originality, were such that its meager and"
487,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,grudging acceptance seems now inexplicable.
488,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
489,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,The most important event in the life of Browning during this period was
490,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,his acquaintance with Miss Elizabeth Barrett. In 1844 she brought out a
491,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,new volume of poems which he saw and greatly admired. He wrote to her
492,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,expressing delight in her work and asking permission to call; but Miss
493,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Barrett, owing to long-continued invalidism, had lived in almost entire"
494,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"seclusion, and she was not at first willing to receive Mr. Browning."
495,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"This was in January, 1845, and many letters passed between them before"
496,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,the first interview in the following May. Mr. Browning's love for Miss
497,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Barrett found almost immediate expression and she was soon conscious of
498,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"an equally strong love for him, but for a considerable time she"
499,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,persistently refused to marry him. To her mind the obstacles were almost
500,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,insurmountable. Of these her ill-health was chief. She could not
501,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"consent, she said, to dim the prosperities of his career by a union with"
502,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"her future, which she characterized as a precarious thing, a thing for"
503,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,making burdens out of--but not for his carrying. In exchange for the
504,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""noble extravagancies"" of his love she could bring him only ""anxiety and"
505,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"more sadness than he was born to."" This obstacle of ill-health was"
506,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,unexpectedly modified by a very mild winter and by the new physical
507,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,vigor brought in the train of new happiness. From this point of view the
508,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"marriage, though hazardous, was practicable by the end of the summer of"
509,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,1846. A second obstacle lay in the nature and opinions of Miss Barrett's
510,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"father, who governed even his grown-up children by ""an incredible system"
511,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"of patriarchal absolutism."" By what was variously termed an obliquity of"
512,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the will, an eccentricity, a monomania, he had decided that none of his"
513,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"children should marry, and on this point he demanded ""passive"
514,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"obedience."" It was perfectly clear that Miss Barrett could not gain his"
515,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"consent to her marriage, and so, after long hesitation and much"
516,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"unhappiness, she decided to marry Mr. Browning without that consent. In"
517,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,order to save her family and close friends from the blame sure to fall
518,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"upon them for the remotest sanction of her marriage, her plans were kept"
519,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,an absolute secret. She met Mr. Browning at Marylebone Church on
520,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"September 12, 1846, and they were married there, Mrs. Browning returning"
521,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"at once to her own home, where she remained till a week later, when she"
522,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,started for Italy with her husband. The wedding was then announced.
523,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Throughout her father's life Mrs. Browning endeavored to placate him,"
524,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"for she devotedly loved him and she had been his favorite child, but in"
525,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"vain. He would never see her again, he returned her letters unopened,"
526,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,and he would not allow her to be spoken of in his presence.
527,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
528,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"After resting a week in Paris Mr. and Mrs. Browning went on to Pisa,"
529,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"where they remained nearly seven months. The ""miracle"" of the Pisa life"
530,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"was Mrs. Browning's gain in health. ""You are not _improved_, you are"
531,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"_transformed_,"" was Mrs. Jameson's exclamation. It was at Pisa that Mr."
532,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning came to know of the sonnets his wife had written during the
533,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,progress of their courtship and engagement. In _Critical Kit-Kats_
534,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"(1896) Mr. Gosse tells the story as Mr. Browning gave it to him: ""One"
535,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"day, early in 1847, their breakfast being over, Mrs. Browning went"
536,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"upstairs, while her husband stood at the window watching the street till"
537,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,the table could be cleared. He was presently aware of someone behind
538,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"him, although the servant had gone. It was Mrs. Browning who held him by"
539,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the shoulder to prevent his turning to look at her, and at the same time"
540,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,pushed a packet of papers into the pocket of his coat. She told him to
541,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,read that and to tear it up if he did not like it; and then she fled
542,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"again to her room."" Mr. Browning felt at once that he had no right to"
543,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"keep such poetry as a private possession. ""I dared not,"" he said,"
544,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""reserve to myself the finest sonnets written in any language since"
545,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Shakespeare's."" They were accordingly published in 1850, under the"
546,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"intentionally mystifying title, _Sonnets from the Portuguese_."
547,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
548,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"The Brownings reached Florence April 20, 1847. After several changes"
549,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"they were, in May, 1848, established in the home in which they remained"
550,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,during Mrs. Browning's life. It was a suite of rooms on the second floor
551,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,of the Palazzo Guidi. Of the practical side of this early Florentine
552,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"life, Mrs. Browning wrote, ""My dear brothers have the illusion that"
553,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,nobody should marry on less than two thousand a year. Good heavens! how
554,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"preposterous it does seem to me! We scarcely spend three hundred, and I"
555,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"have every luxury I ever had, and which it would be so easy to give up,"
556,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"at need; and Robert wouldn't sleep, I think, if an unpaid bill dragged"
557,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,itself by any chance into another week. He says that when people get
558,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,into pecuniary difficulties his sympathies always go with the butchers
559,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"and the bakers."" In accordance with this horror of owing five shillings"
560,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"five days, the furnishings of the new home, ""the rococo chairs, spring"
561,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"sofas, carved bookcases, satin from cardinals' beds, and the rest,"" were"
562,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"accumulated at a pace dictated by the bank account, but for all that it"
563,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,was not long before the rooms began to take on an aspect as beautiful as
564,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,it was homelike.
565,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
566,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,By preference the Brownings lived very quietly. At the end of fifteen
567,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"months Mrs. Browning wrote, ""Robert has not been out an evening of the"
568,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"fifteen months; but what with music and books and writing and talking,"
569,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"we scarcely know how the days go, it's such a gallop on the grass."""
570,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"March 9, 1849, was born Wiedemann, later known as ""Penini"" or ""Pen"""
571,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning. Coincident with this joy was the grief caused by the death of
572,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning's mother, a sorrow from which he rallied but slowly. The"
573,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Florentine life was occasionally varied by summers at Bagni di Lucca,"
574,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"winters in Paris or Rome, and several visits to England. There was also"
575,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,an increasing social life. Americans were especially welcome to the
576,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Brownings because, while England was still indifferent to Browning's"
577,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"work, America had given it an appreciative welcome. In March, 1861, Mrs."
578,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning wrote, ""I don't complain for myself of an unappreciative"
579,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,public. _I have no reason_. But just for _that_ reason I complain more
580,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"about Robert.... In America he is a power, a writer, a poet--he is read,"
581,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"he lives in the hearts of the people.""[4]"
582,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
583,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Among the Americans associated with the Brownings for longer or shorter
584,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"periods during their life in Florence were two distinguished women,"
585,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Margaret Fuller Ossoli and Harriet Beecher Stowe. In 1847, George"
586,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"William Curtis spent two days with the Brownings at Vallombrosa, a visit"
587,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"later described in his _Easy Chair_. Mr. Field, who had brought out the"
588,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"American reprint of the two-volume edition of Browning's poems in 1849,"
589,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"was a guest at Casa Guidi in 1852. Charles Sumner writes of ""delicious"
590,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Tuscan evenings"" with the Brownings and the Storys in 1859. Mr."
591,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Browning's interests in art led to friendships with American artists,"
592,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"among whom were Mr. Page, who painted a successful portrait of Browning;"
593,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Miss Harriet Hosmer, to whom Mr. and Mrs. Browning finally consented to"
594,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"sit for the ""Clasped Hands""; and Hiram Powers. The dearest American"
595,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"friends were, however, Mr. and Mrs. Hawthorne and Mr. and Mrs. Story."
596,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
597,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Music and art were among Browning's chief delights in Florence. George
598,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,William Curtis in describing the trip to Vallombrosa says that it was
599,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,part of their pleasure to sit in the dusky convent chapel while Browning
600,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"at the organ ""chased a fugue of Master Hughes of Saxe Gotha, or dreamed"
601,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"out upon twilight keys a faint throbbing toccata of Galuppi's."" Modeling"
602,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,in clay was even more satisfying as a personal resource. In the autumn
603,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"of 1860 Mrs. Browning wrote, ""Robert has taken to modeling under Mr."
604,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Story (at his studio) and is making extraordinary progress, turning to"
605,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"account his studies in anatomy. He has copied already two busts, the"
606,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"young Augustus and the Psyche, and is engaged on another, enchanted with"
607,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"his new trade, working six hours a day."" Some months later she added,"
608,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""The modeling combines body-work and soul-work, and the more tired he"
609,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"has been, and the more his back ached, poor fellow, the more he has"
610,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"exulted and been happy--'_no, nothing ever made him so happy before_.'"""
611,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"He found, also, an unfailing pleasure in the study of great pictures."
612,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,And he was a buyer of pictures with a collector's delight in hunting out
613,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,the work of the unappreciated early Tuscan artists. Mrs. Orr says that
614,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,he owned at least one picture by each of the obscure artists mentioned
615,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"in ""Old Pictures in Florence."""
616,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
617,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Mrs. Browning sometimes expressed regret that Browning should give
618,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"himself so unreservedly in so many directions, because she felt that he"
619,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,had thus too little time and energy left for poetry. Her fear was not
620,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"without justification, for after the richly productive period from 1841"
621,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"to 1846, we come upon a space of nine years the only publications of"
622,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"which are, in 1850, _Christmas Eve and Easter Day_, a long poem in two"
623,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"parts giving the arguments in favor of Christianity; and, in 1852, an"
624,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"introduction to a collection of letters then supposed to be by Shelley,"
625,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,but since found to be spurious. The essay is nevertheless of importance
626,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"as an exposition of Browning's theory of poetry, and as an interesting"
627,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,study of Shelley.
628,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
629,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"In 1855, at the close of this period of nine years, there appeared a"
630,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"collection of fifty-one poems entitled _Men and Women_. In ""fundamental"
631,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"brain power,"" insight, beauty, and mastery of style, these poems show"
632,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning at the highest level of his poetic achievement. It is in these
633,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,remarkable poems that he brought to perfection a poetic form which he
634,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"practically invented, the dramatic monologue, a form in which there is"
635,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,but one speaker but which is essentially dramatic in effect. The
636,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,dramatic quality arises partly from the implied presence of listeners
637,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,whose expressions of assent or dissent determine the progress or the
638,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"abrupt changes of direction of the speaker's words. In ""Andrea del"
639,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Sarto,"" for example, Lucrezia's smiles and frowns and gestures of"
640,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"impatience are a constant influence, and the poem presents as vivid an"
641,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,interplay of personalities as any scene in a drama. But the implied
642,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"listener is hardly more than a secondary dramatic element, the chief one"
643,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"being that the speaker talks, as do the characters in a play, out of the"
644,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"demands of the immediate experience, gradually and casually disclosing"
645,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"all the tangled web of influence, all the clashes of will with destiny,"
646,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"of desire with convention, that have led to the crisis depicted. Fra"
647,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Lippo Lippi gives no consecutive history of his life, only such snatches"
648,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"of it as partially account for his present mad freak, but the strife"
649,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,between his own nature and instinct on the one hand and the conventions
650,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,and traditions of religious art on the other could hardly be more
651,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"vividly presented. _In a Balcony_, the one drama in _Men and Women_, has"
652,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"but a fragment of a plot, but in intensity, reality, and passion it"
653,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"excels most of Browning's dramas, and, in spite of its long speeches,"
654,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"has proved effective on the stage.[5] In variety of theme,"
655,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"subject-matter, and verse-form, the poems of _Men and Women_ defy"
656,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"classification. Whatever page one turns, there is something novel,"
657,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"stimulating, captivating. All of Browning's Florentine interests are"
658,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"represented here--his love of old pictures and little-known music, his"
659,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"delight in Florence, Venice, Rome, in all Italy, her skies and her"
660,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"landscapes, the vagrants of her streets, her religious ceremonies, her"
661,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"church dignitaries, her scholars. Then there are love-poems in all"
662,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"tones and tempers, the noblest of them all, ""One Word More,"" being"
663,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning's most direct and personal tribute to his wife. And we see in
664,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,its keenest form his intellectual delight in subtle disquisition. The
665,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"doctrine of immortality as it appeals to the mind of the cultured,"
666,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,dissatisfied pagan Cleon; the miracle of Lazarus as it is brooded over
667,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,by the Arab physician Karshish; the balancing of faith and doubt in the
668,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,clever casuistry of Bishop Blougram--these are topics to Browning's
669,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,taste and are treated with skill and mastery. Taken all in all these
670,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,poems give to the reader a full impression of Browning's characteristic
671,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"force, the darting, penetrating power of his phrase, the rush and energy"
672,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"and leap of his thought. It is by _Men and Women_, the somewhat similar"
673,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"_Dramatis Personæ_, and the earlier _Dramatic Lyrics_ and _Dramatic"
674,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Romances_, that Browning is most widely and most favorably known."
675,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
676,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,During the first ten years that the Brownings were in Florence Mrs.
677,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning's health was so good that she was able to enjoy social and
678,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,outdoor pleasures to a degree that would have been thought impossible
679,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,before her marriage. She had also kept up her literary work. A new
680,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,edition of her poems appeared in 1849; in 1851 she published _Casa Guidi
681,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Windows_, poems illustrative of her ardent interest in all that"
682,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,pertained to the fight for Italian freedom; and in 1856 her long-planned
683,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,verse novel _Aurora Leigh_ was completed and published. But soon after
684,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,this her strength began insensibly to fail and during the last three
685,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,years of her life she suffered much from repeated bronchial attacks.
686,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"However, her death, in June, 1861, was entirely unexpected. The"
687,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Florentines had loved her deeply and had appreciated her utterances in
688,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"behalf of a free Italy. She was, accordingly, buried in Florence, with"
689,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""extraordinary demonstrations of respect,"" and the house where she had"
690,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,lived was marked by the municipality with a commemorative tablet.
691,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
692,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning's wish was to leave Florence at once and to make the new life
693,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"as unlike the old as possible. He went to London, and after some delay"
694,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"established himself in a house at Warwick Crescent, where he lived till"
695,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"1887. The first portion of his life in England was one of ""unbearable"
696,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"loneliness."" He took care of his son, busied himself with a new edition"
697,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"of his wife's poems, read and studied and wrote with feverish intensity,"
698,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"and avoided people. But with the spring of 1863, says Mr. Gosse, ""a"
699,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,great change came over Browning's habits. He had shunned all invitations
700,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"into society, but ... it suddenly occurred to him that this mode of life"
701,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"was morbid and unworthy,"" and thereupon he entered into the social,"
702,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"literary, musical, and artistic life of London."
703,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
704,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,The nine years following 1855 were again a period of small productivity.
705,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"_Dramatis Personæ_ was a slender volume to represent so many years, even"
706,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"though it contained such great poems as ""Rabbi Ben Ezra,"" ""A Death in"
707,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the Desert,"" and ""Abt Vogler."" But during this period a long poem, _The"
708,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Ring and the Book_, had been maturing. In 1860, while still at Casa"
709,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Guidi, Browning had found at a book-stall the now famous ""square old"
710,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"yellow Book,"" containing the legal record of a famous Roman murder case."
711,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"He read the account on the way home, and before night had so mastered"
712,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the details that, as he paced up and down on the terrace in the"
713,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"darkness, he saw the tragedy unfold before him in picture after picture."
714,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"It was not, however, till 1864 that he definitely set to work on the"
715,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,composition of the poem. It was published in four volumes of three parts
716,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"each, in the winter and spring of 1868-9. The poem has a novel"
717,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,structure. The story is retold ten times by different persons and with
718,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,such variations of fact and opinions and style as are dictated by the
719,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,knowledge and the character of the speaker. The monologues of Count
720,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Guido, who murdered his wife, of Pompilia the young wife, of Caponsacchi"
721,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the ""soldier saint"" who endeavored to save her, and of the old Pope, are"
722,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"by far the most interesting portions of the poem, but the whole of it is"
723,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"remarkable, and it justly takes rank as one of England's greatest poems."
724,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,With the appearance of this book Browning's genius received adequate
725,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"recognition in high places. _The Athenæum_ called it ""the _opus magnum_"
726,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"of the generation, not merely beyond all parallel the supremest poetic"
727,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"achievement of the time, but the most precious and profound spiritual"
728,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"treasure that England has possessed since the days of Shakespeare."""
729,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
730,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,The last ten or twelve years of Browning's life were so crowded with
731,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"interests, occupations, publications, friends, honors, that not even a"
732,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,summary of them can be undertaken here. Mr. Sharp says of this period:
733,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
734,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""Everybody wished him to come and dine; and he did his best to gratify"
735,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Everybody. He saw everything; read all the notable books; kept himself
736,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,acquainted with the leading contents of the journals and magazines;
737,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"conducted a large correspondence; read new French, German, and Italian"
738,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,books of mark; read and translated Euripides and Æschylus; knew all the
739,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"gossip of the literary clubs, the salons, and the studios; was a"
740,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"frequenter of afternoon tea parties; and then, over and above it, he was"
741,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning--the most profoundly subtle mind that has exercised itself in
742,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"poetry since Shakespeare."""
743,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
744,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Mr. Henry James in commenting on Browning's rich and ample London period
745,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"with ""its felicities and prosperities of every sort,"" says that in"
746,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"contemplating ""the wonderful Browning ... the accomplished, saturated,"
747,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"sane, sound man of the London world and the world of culture,"" it was"
748,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"impossible not to believe that ""he had arrived somehow, for his own deep"
749,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"purposes, at the enjoyment of a double identity,"" so dissociated were"
750,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the poet and the ""member of society."" Phillips Brooks, who met Browning"
751,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"in England in 1865-6, was impressed by his fullness of life and said he"
752,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"was ""very like some of the best of Thackeray's London men."" In public"
753,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"and on ordinary social occasions Browning is said to have been frank,"
754,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"charming, friendly--""more agreeable,"" Mary Anderson said, ""than"
755,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"distinguished."" With intimate friends, however, the poet had quite"
756,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"another sort of charm. ""To a single listener,"" says Mr. Gosse, with whom"
757,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"he was on familiar terms, ""the Browning of his own study was to the"
758,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning of a dinner party as a tiger cat is to a domestic cat. In such
759,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,conversation his natural strength came out. His talk assumed the volume
760,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"and the tumult of a cascade. His voice rose to a shout, sank to a"
761,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"whisper, ran up and down the gamut of conversational melody. Those whom"
762,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"he was expecting will never forget his welcome, the loud trumpet-note"
763,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"from the other end of the passage, the talk already in full flood at a"
764,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"distance of twenty feet. Then, in his own study or drawing-room, what he"
765,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,loved was to capture his visitor in a low armchair's 'sofa-lap of
766,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"leather,' and from a most unfair vantage of height to tyrannize, to walk"
767,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"around the victim, in front, behind, on this side, on that, weaving"
768,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"magic circles, now with gesticulating arms thrown high, now groveling on"
769,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the floor to find some reference in a folio, talking all the while, a"
770,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"redundant turmoil of thoughts, fancies, and reminiscences flowing from"
771,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"those generous lips."""
772,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
773,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Elsewhere Mr. Gosse summed up his personal impressions of Mr. Browning,"
774,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,as follows:
775,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
776,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"""I am bound to tell you that I saw a different Browning from the hero"
777,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,of all the handbooks and 'gospels' which are now in vogue. People are
778,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,beginning to treat this vehement and honest poet as if he were a sort of
779,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Marcus Aurelius and John the Baptist rolled into one. I have just seen a
780,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"book in which it is proposed that Browning should supersede the Bible,"
781,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,in which it is asserted that a set of his volumes will teach religion
782,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"better than all the theologies in the world. Well, I did not know that"
783,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"holy monster.... What I saw was an unostentatious, keen, active man of"
784,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"the world, one who never failed to give good practical advice in matters"
785,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"of business and conduct, one who loved his friends and certainly hated"
786,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,his enemies; a man alive in every eager passionate nerve of him; a man
787,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"who loved to discuss people and affairs, and a bit of a gossip; a bit of"
788,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"a partisan, too, and not without his humorous prejudices. He was simple"
789,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"to a high degree, simple in his scrupulous dress, his loud, happy voice,"
790,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"his insatiable curiosity."""
791,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,
792,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Browning's London life was varied by many summer journeyings to French
793,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"sea-coast towns, to Wales, and to Scotland. But it was seventeen years"
794,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,after the death of his wife before he could bring himself to revisit
795,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Italy. Even then he avoided Florence. He took his sister to Northern
796,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,Italy; and Asolo and Venice became the towns around which their
797,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"affections centered. Two American friends, Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore, and"
798,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"Mrs. Arthur Bronson,[6] contributed to the happiness of these Italian"
799,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"sojourns. In 1888 Browning's son, who had married an American girl,"
800,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"bought the Palazzo Rezzonico in Venice, so that Browning had an"
801,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,"additional personal reason for his trip to Venice in 1889. He was well,"
802,THE LIFE OF BROWNING,and he took great pleasure in his son's admirably planned restoration of

824,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Before entering upon a discussion of Browning's poetry it will be of
825,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,interest to note briefly some of the more striking general
826,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,characteristics of the English literature contemporary with his work.
827,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"From _Pauline_ to _Asolando_ is over half a century, but as a central"
828,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,and especially significant portion of Browning's career we may take the
829,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"three decades from 1841, when he began the _Bells and Pomegranates_"
830,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"series, to 1869, when _The Ring and the Book_ appeared, for these years"
831,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,include all of his dramas and most of the poetry on which his fame
832,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,rests. A survey of this period at once reveals the predominance of
833,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,fiction. Within these years come nearly all the novels of Charles
834,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Dickens, of William Makepeace Thackeray, of Charlotte Brontë, of Wilkie"
835,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Collins, of Charles Kingsley, of Mrs. Gaskell, of Anthony Trollope, of"
836,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"George Macdonald, of Charles Reade, much of the work of Bulwer Lytton,"
837,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,all the novels of George Eliot except _Middlemarch_ and _Daniel
838,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Deronda_, and the earliest of George Meredith's books. This is a notable"
839,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,showing. No previous period in English literature had presented anything
840,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,like so wide a range in fiction or had brought forward so large a number
841,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of novels of the first rank. These years were equally rich in essays,"
842,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"including much of Carlyle's work, all of Macaulay's except the early"
843,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""Essay on Milton,"" the religious polemics of Frederick Dennison Maurice"
844,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"and John Henry Newman, nearly all of Ruskin's discussions of art and"
845,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"social history, most of Leigh Hunt's literary criticism, and Matthew"
846,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Arnold's important early critical essays. This, too, is a notable"
847,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"showing. But if we turn to the two realms in which Browning excelled,"
848,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"poetry and drama, we find different conditions. During the central"
849,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"period of his career, there was, aside from his own work, not a single"
850,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"important drama published. The theaters were prosperous, but they"
851,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"brought out only old plays or new ones of inferior rank. In poetry, too,"
852,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"if we set aside the great names of Tennyson and Browning, the period was"
853,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,neither rich nor varied. During Browning's first great productive
854,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"period, 1841-46, the only other poems of note were Tennyson's two"
855,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"volumes in 1842. In the nine years from 1846 to _Men and Women_ in 1855,"
856,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the chief poems were Tennyson's _The Princess_, _In Memoriam_, and"
857,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"_Maud_, for though Wordsworth's _Prelude_ was one of the greatest"
858,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"publications of the mid-century, it was written years before, and can"
859,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"hardly be counted as belonging to this era. There are, during the"
860,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"decade, many poems of secondary rank, the most important of them being"
861,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Mrs. Browning's _Sonnets from the Portuguese_ and _Aurora Leigh_, but"
862,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"besides Tennyson and Browning, the only poet of high rank is Matthew"
863,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Arnold, whose slender volumes voice the doubts and difficulties of the"
864,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,age as Browning's poems voice its optimism. In the fourteen years
865,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,between _Men and Women_ and _The Ring and the Book_ poets of a new kind
866,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"appear; William Morris's _Defense of Guinevere_, _The Life and Death of"
867,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Jason_ and _The Earthly Paradise_, and Swinburne's early poems are alien"
868,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"to the work of Browning in form, subject-matter, and ideals. The fact"
869,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"is, the more definitely we try to place Browning in his literary"
870,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,environment the more distinctly do we perceive that he was _sui generis_
871,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,among his contemporaries. He combined in striking fashion the intensity
872,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,of the poet and the strong social sense of the prose writer.
873,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
874,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,It seems also wise to glance at the outset at a few of the main
875,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"criticisms that have been made on Browning's poetry, for the result of"
876,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,his marked originality is that no poet of the time has been so greatly
877,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,praised and blamed.
878,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
879,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"A natural first topic is his really famous ""obscurity."" This obscurity"
880,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"is variously ascribed to a diction unduly learned, or almost"
881,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"unintelligibly colloquial, or grotesquely inventive; to figures of"
882,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,speech drawn from sources too unfamiliar or elaborated to the point of
883,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"confusion; to sentences complicated by startling inversions, by double"
884,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"parentheses, by broken constructions, or by a grammatical structure"
885,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,defying analysis. It would be quite possible to illustrate each of these
886,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"points from Browning's works, and it cannot be denied that his poetry is"
887,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,sometimes needlessly and inexcusably hard reading. But in reality the
888,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,difficulties in his poems come less from stylistic defects than from the
889,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"subject matter. What Mr. Chesterton calls Browning's love for ""the"
890,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"holes and corners of history,"" leads him to the use of much unfamiliar"
891,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,detail. A large part of the difficulty in reading _Sordello_ arises from
892,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the fact that all Browning's accumulated knowledge of medieval Italy is
893,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"there poured forth in an allusive, taken-for-granted manner, till even"
894,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the practiced reader turns away perplexed and overwhelmed. So, too, ""Old"
895,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Pictures in Florence,"" ""Pictor Ignotus,"" and ""Fra Lippo Lippi"" assume on"
896,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the part of the reader a minute familiarity with early Florentine art.
897,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Occasionally the poems demand an exceptional technical knowledge of some
898,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"sort, as in ""Abt Vogler,"" where only a trained musician can fully"
899,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,understand the terminology. Many even of the minor poems belong to
900,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,realms of thought and experience so remote that only by distinct effort
901,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"do we transport ourselves thither. It would, for instance, be absurd to"
902,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"call ""Two in the Campagna"" difficult in form or phrasing, yet it"
903,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,narrates an experience intelligible only to those who have loved deeply
904,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,but have found in the very heart of that love a baffling sense of
905,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,inevitable personal isolation. Sometimes the difficulty arises from the
906,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"extreme subtlety of the thought. ""Evelyn Hope,"" the simplest of poems in"
907,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"expression, presents novel and elusive ideas. Mr. Chesterton ingeniously"
908,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"ascribes Browning's obscurity to ""intellectual humility,"" to an"
909,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,assumption that his readers were in possession of a native endowment and
910,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,an acquired intellectual wealth on a par with his own; but the defense
911,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,seems rather forced. Mrs. Browning gave one of the best brief analyses
912,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of Mr. Browning's obscurity. He had been attacked as being ""misty"" and"
913,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"she wrote to him, ""You never _are_ misty, not even in 'Sordello'--never"
914,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"vague. Your graver cuts deep, sharp lines, always--and there is an extra"
915,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"distinctness in your images and thoughts, from the midst of which,"
916,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"crossing each other infinitely, the general significance seems to"
917,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"escape."" But the classic defense of Browning from this point of view"
918,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,may be found in Swinburne's Introduction to Chapman's _Poems_:
919,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
920,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""The difficulty found by many in certain of Mr. Browning's works arises"
921,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"from a quality the very reverse of that which produces obscurity,"
922,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,properly so-called. Obscurity is the natural product of turbid forces
923,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,and confused ideas; of a feeble and clouded or of a vigorous but unfixed
924,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,and chaotic intellect.... Now if there is any great quality more
925,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,perceptible than another in Mr. Browning's intellect it is his decisive
926,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"and incisive faculty of thought, his sureness and intensity of"
927,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"perception, his rapid and trenchant resolution of aim.... The very"
928,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"essence of Mr. Browning's aim and method, as exhibited in the ripest"
929,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"fruits of his intelligence, is such as implies above all other things"
930,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the possession of a quality the very opposite of obscurity--a faculty of
931,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"spiritual illumination rapid and intense and subtle as lightning, which"
932,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,brings to bear upon its object by way of direct and vivid illustration
933,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"every symbol and every detail on which its light is flashed in passing."""
934,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Browning has himself a word to say on this topic. He wrote to a friend:
935,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
936,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""I can have little doubt that my writing has been in the main too hard"
937,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,for many I should have been pleased to communicate with; but I never
938,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,designedly tried to puzzle people as some of my critics have supposed.
939,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"On the other hand, I never pretended to offer such literature as should"
940,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"be a substitute for a cigar or a game at dominoes to an idle man. So,"
941,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"perhaps, on the whole, I get my deserts, and something over--not a crowd"
942,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"but a few I value more."""
943,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
944,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,A second charge not infrequently brought against Browning's verse is
945,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"that it is harsh, and at times even ugly. This charge, like that of"
946,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"obscurity, cannot be wholly denied. The harshness results from incorrect"
947,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"rhymes, from irregular movement of the verse, or from difficult"
948,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,combinations of vowels and consonants. No reader of Browning's poems can
949,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,fail to have been impressed by his intellectual agility in matching odd
950,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,rhymes. In dash and originality his rhymes out-rank even those in
951,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Butler's _Hudibras_ and Lowell's _Fable for Critics_. We find in
952,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"_Pacchiarotto_, for instance, many rhymes of the gayest, most freakish,"
953,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"most grotesque character--""monkey, one key,"" ""prelude, hell-hued,"""
954,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""stubborn, cub-born,"" ""_was_ hard, hazard,"" all occur in a single"
955,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,stanza. An example of exceptional facility in rhyming is found in
956,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""Through the Metidja,"" where, without repetition of words and without"
957,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"forcing of the sense thirty-six words rhyme with ""ride."" It cannot be"
958,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,denied that this remarkable facility led Browning occasionally into the
959,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,use of odd rhymes in poems where no light or comic effect was intended;
960,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,but a detailed study of his rhymes[7] shows that the proportion of
961,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"incorrect rhymes is really small, that the grotesque rhymes are more"
962,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"striking than numerous, and that they are usually in places where they"
963,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,are dramatically appropriate. His use of harsh words and sound-blendings
964,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,is also often to be justified on the ground of their appropriateness to
965,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the idea. Compare, for instance, the flowing, easy words, the musical"
966,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"linking of sounds, in the first stanza of ""Love Among the Ruins"" with"
967,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the harsh words, harshly combined, in the twelfth and thirteenth stanzas"
968,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of ""Childe Roland."" Both effects are artistic because each sort of"
969,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,combination is in response to the nature of the thought. It is true that
970,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"sometimes, perhaps not infrequently, the verse is rugged or uncouth"
971,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"where the sense does not call for such form, and there are lines that"
972,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,not only remind us of De Quincey's dictum that certain words should be
973,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""boiled before they are eaten,"" but which have no metrical flow at all;"
974,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,they defy any sort of scansion and read like rough prose. But a poet
975,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,has a right of appeal to the sum of his manifest excellencies rather
976,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"than to his defects, and if we take Browning's best work we find a"
977,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,harmony of movement superior in musical effect to a more technically
978,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,regular meter. In many poems the meter is indissolubly fused with the
979,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"pictures, the ideas, the events. Take, for instance, ""The Pied Piper of"
980,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Hamelin,"" where the hurry-skurry of the verse is in complete harmony"
981,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"with the quaint, rapid tale. The hoof-beats of galloping horses is heard"
982,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"all through ""How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix."" The slow"
983,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"march, the stately chant, are rhythmically present throughout ""A"
984,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Grammarian's Funeral."" In ""The Flight of the Duchess"" the change from"
985,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the rough servitor's narrative to the incantation of the gypsy-queen is
986,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,as exquisitely marked in the metrical movement and in the rhymes as it
987,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,is in the diction and tone of thought. Many other examples might be
988,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"cited. Mr. Brinton, who has made a detailed and competent study of"
989,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Browning's verse, gives his final opinion in these words: ""In the"
990,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,volumes of Browning I maintain that we find so many instances of
991,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"profound insight into verbal harmonies, such singular strength of poetic"
992,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"grouping, and such a marvelous grasp of the rhythmic properties of the"
993,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,English language that we must assign to him a rank second to no English
994,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"poet of this century.""[8]"
995,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
996,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,A third charge brought against Browning's art is that he makes all his
997,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"characters talk ""Browningese""; that is, that he endows all of them with"
998,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the power to use such words and sentences and thought processes as are
999,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,natural to him and to him only. Mr. Stedman in emphasizing this
1000,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"characteristic of the poet says of _Pippa Passes_: ""The usual fault is"
1001,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"present--the characters, whether students, peasants, or soldiers, all"
1002,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"talk like sages; Pippa reasons like a Paracelsus in pantalettes."" It is,"
1003,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of course, obvious at the first glance that there is a lack of"
1004,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,verisimilitude in Pippa's rich and beautiful soliloquies. Certainly no
1005,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"fourteen-year-old mill girl could so describe a sunrise, or play so"
1006,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"brilliantly with a sunbeam in a water-basin, or outline so cleverly the"
1007,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,stories of the happiest four in Asolo. The same is true of Phene's long
1008,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"speech to Jules; no untutored girl brought up in degradation, could"
1009,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,present such thoughts in such words. When we analyze Browning's way of
1010,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"presenting a character, however, we find that the lack of verisimilitude"
1011,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,is usually external and has to do chiefly with expression. Browning
1012,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,works on the fundamental assumption that he has a poetic right to make
1013,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,all sorts of people articulate. He lends his mind out in the service of
1014,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,their thoughts and feelings. He makes people reveal themselves by
1015,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"putting into words their elusive, dim, tangled, and even unrecognized"
1016,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,motives and hopes and joys and despairs. He sums up in the speeches all
1017,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the potentialities of the situation. All the significance latent in the
1018,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,type of character and environment is somehow heightened and symbolized.
1019,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,All this is put in his own highly individual diction. Yet it can hardly
1020,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"be said that he violates poetic realism in the deeper sense, for he"
1021,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"never puts a halo around a situation, never goes counter to its"
1022,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,potentialities. Instead he strikes fire from it. He shows what is
1023,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"actually in the situation, but at white heat and laid bare to its"
1024,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"center. When this method has once been recognized, discomfort on the"
1025,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"score of lack of verisimilitude practically disappears, and the reader"
1026,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"yields himself to the joy of the rich, subtle, and stimulating analysis."
1027,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1028,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,We may now turn to a consideration of the subject-matter and the main
1029,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,ideas of Browning's poetry. From whatever point of view we regard his
1030,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"work, we find that ultimately the emphasis rests on the same great"
1031,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"central fact, the supremacy of his interest in human nature. This"
1032,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"dominating interest is shown, for instance, by a study of his treatment"
1033,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of physical nature. To be sure, no one can read his poems without"
1034,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,recognizing the truth that his use of natural facts is distinctive in
1035,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,kind and very stimulating. A mere reference to the pictures of the sky
1036,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"in _Pippa Passes_, the vivid descriptions of fruits and flowers in ""An"
1037,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Englishman in Italy,"" the remarkable studies of small animal life in"
1038,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""Saul"" and ""Caliban upon Setebos,"" of birds in ""Home-Thoughts, from"
1039,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Abroad,"" of insects in the first part of _Paracelsus_ and in many later"
1040,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"poems, suffices to show that in mature life he did not lose the keenness"
1041,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,of observation and interest characteristic of his youth. Yet it is also
1042,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"evident that his use of nature by way of direct description, or even as"
1043,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"illustrative material, is far less in amount than that of other notable"
1044,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"nineteenth century poets. He cares much less for ""the river's line, the"
1045,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"mountains round it and the sky above"" than for the ""figures of man,"
1046,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"woman, and child these are frame to."" Where nature is drawn upon, it is"
1047,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"almost invariably in complete subordination to some human interest, and"
1048,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"its literary form is almost always that of casual mention, background,"
1049,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"or similitude, and the first of these is the most frequent. Furthermore,"
1050,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,nearly all these passages are a mere statement of observed fact without
1051,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,comment or interpretation. There is one great passage in _Paracelsus_
1052,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,where the joy of God in the act of creation is depicted; there are
1053,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,occasional references to the delight of man in the external world; and
1054,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"now and then, as in ""By the Fireside,"" man and nature are intimately"
1055,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,fused; but such conceptions rarely occur. In Browning's poetry the
1056,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,boundary lines between man and nature are clearly marked. In
1057,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,_Paracelsus_ he definitely protests against man's way of reading his own
1058,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"moods into nature, and of attributing to her his own qualities and"
1059,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"emotions. He also always accounts man, if he has truly entered into his"
1060,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"spiritual heritage, as consciously superior to nature. The troubadour"
1061,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Eglamour, in _Sordello_, says that man shrinks to naught if matched with"
1062,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"a quiet sea or sky, but Browning calls that Eglamour's ""false thought."""
1063,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"To Browning, nature was to be studied, enjoyed, and used, but it was not"
1064,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,as to Keats a realm of enchantment; or as to Wordsworth the realm where
1065,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,alone the divine and the human could pass the boundaries of sense and
1066,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,meet; or as to Matthew Arnold a refuge from pain and disillusionment.
1067,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Browning regards the world about him more in the sane, unsentimental,"
1068,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"straightforward, intelligible way of Chaucer or of Shakespeare. The"
1069,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,mystical elements in Wordsworth's feeling for nature were foreign to
1070,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Browning's mind. An instructive comparison might be made between
1071,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Wordsworth's ""Ode on Intimations of Immortality"" and Browning's"
1072,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""Prologue to Asolando."" The poems have the same starting point. Each one"
1073,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"attributes sadness to the poet's old age, and each gives as a cause of"
1074,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the sadness the inevitable fading of the glory with which all nature was
1075,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,invested to the eye of his youth. But here the resemblance ends.
1076,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Wordsworth believes that the youthful vision was a divine revelation to
1077,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,be regained when the round of existence should be completed by a return
1078,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"to his immortal home, and on the memory of that vision he founded his"
1079,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,faith in a future life. But Browning welcomed the loss of the vision.
1080,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Objects had been to him ""palpably fire-clothed""; but with the loss of"
1081,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""flame"" there was a gain in reality. The vision had enthralled and"
1082,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"subjugated him; but with the sight of ""a naked world"" he had become"
1083,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"conscious of things as they are, and he rejoiced in a justness of"
1084,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"perception that declared what were to him the two great facts of life,"
1085,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the power and beauty of God, and the glory of the human soul. On these,"
1086,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"not on nature, he put his stress."
1087,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1088,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Browning's paramount interest in human nature is further illustrated by
1089,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"his poems on the various arts. Of music, painting, and sculpture he has"
1090,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,written with the intimate and minute knowledge of a specialist in each
1091,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"art. He is familiar with implements and materials, with the tricks of"
1092,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the trade, the talk of the studios; but, after all, the art as an art is"
1093,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,of much less interest to him than is the worker. The process and even
1094,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the completed product are in Browning's view important only in so far as
1095,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"they reveal or affect the artist, the musician, the sculptor, or some"
1096,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"phase of life. In such poems as ""Abt Vogler,"" ""Fra Lippo Lippi,"" ""Andrea"
1097,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"del Sarto,"" we are conscious not so much of music and pictures as of the"
1098,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"secret springs of failure, the divine despairs and discontents, the"
1099,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"aspirations, the creative ecstasies, of the men who wrought in these"
1100,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,realms. Andrea del Sarto's art is not the real theme of the poem bearing
1101,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"his name. It is, rather, his character, of which his art is an"
1102,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,expression. The central fact of the poem is the recognition that a soul
1103,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"morally impoverished cannot, even with well-nigh perfect technique,"
1104,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"produce great work, while, even with faulty technique, a setting of the"
1105,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"soul to grand issues will secure transcendent meanings. So, too, with"
1106,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Abt Vogler. His music is not of the greatest, but our concern is with"
1107,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the musician who, through the completeness of his spiritual absorption"
1108,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"in music, is conducted into a realm of experience beyond that of speech"
1109,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,or even of articulate thought.
1110,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1111,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Another distinctly human aspect of art interests Browning, and that is"
1112,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,its power to represent and so to recall a vanished civilization. Greek
1113,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"statues, the devotional pictures of the early Florentines, the work of"
1114,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the later Italian realists, stand, in ""Old Pictures in Florence,"" as"
1115,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"representatives of the life and thought that produced them. In ""A"
1116,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Toccata of Galuppi's"" the music revivifies the superficial gaiety, the"
1117,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"undertone of fear, in the life of eighteenth century Venice. Highly"
1118,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,significant in this connection are the poems in which he traces the
1119,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"evolution of art. Running through ""Old Pictures in Florence"" and ""Fra"
1120,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Lippo Lippi"" we find an ordered statement of the chief changes in the"
1121,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"ideals of art as Browning saw them. The Greeks, we are told, had"
1122,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,produced in sculpture the most beautiful representations of the human
1123,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,body. But if their successors had been content merely to admire this
1124,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"perfect achievement, they would have purchased satisfaction at the price"
1125,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of their own arrested development. Progress came only when, in the dawn"
1126,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of Italian art, men turned from Greek perfection, from the supremely"
1127,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"beautiful but limited representations of the human body, to an attempt"
1128,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"to paint the invisible, the spiritual side of man's nature. The work of"
1129,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,these artists was great because it was not imitative and because it
1130,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,stretched toward an unending and ideal future. But the idealistic and
1131,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,aspiring temper of early Tuscan art had the defects of its qualities.
1132,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Its spiritual ecstasy once conventionalized and reduced to a formula led
1133,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"to unreality, and, if not to untruth, at least to an unwholesome"
1134,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"ignoring of a part of truth. There was, therefore, an inevitable"
1135,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,reaction to the naturalism described with such verve and gusto by Fra
1136,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Lippo Lippi. But this is, after all, social history in terms of art, and"
1137,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,to Browning what has happened in painting is of value chiefly as showing
1138,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,concretely what has happened in the mind of man.
1139,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1140,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,From the instances already cited it is apparent that Browning's interest
1141,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"centered, not in abstract or theoretical discussions of human problems,"
1142,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,but in the individuals who face the problems. In this point Browning is
1143,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,sharply distinguished from his poetic contemporaries as a class. They
1144,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"felt deeply ""all the weary weight of this unintelligible world,"" so"
1145,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,deeply that while they gave much thought to ideals of social
1146,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"amelioration, few of them presented individuals with any dramatic"
1147,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,distinctness. Browning stands practically by himself in the nineteenth
1148,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"century as the poet who gives us both the ""doubter and the doubt,"" who"
1149,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,is able to join with an impressive statement of the hopes and fears of
1150,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"man, an equally impressive sequence of individual men and women. In this"
1151,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,he harks back to the broad inclusiveness of the Elizabethan dramatists.
1152,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"In contemporary literature, his nearest congeners are in fiction, not in"
1153,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,poetry.
1154,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1155,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,The great number and variety of Browning's characters can be illustrated
1156,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"in different ways. We might, for instance, note how many nationalities"
1157,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"are represented. The personages in ""Stafford"" and the ""Cavalier Tunes"""
1158,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"are Englishmen from the time of the Civil War. ""Clive"" is a true story"
1159,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,of the Indian Empire. We have from Italian life the numerous characters
1160,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"in _Sordello_, ""Fra Lippo Lippi,"" ""Pictor Ignotus,"" ""The Bishop Orders"
1161,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"His Tomb at St. Praxed's Church,"" ""My Last Duchess,"" _The Ring and the"
1162,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Book_, ""A Grammarian's Funeral,"" ""Up at a Villa--Down in the City,"" ""In"
1163,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"a Gondola,"" and many more. ""Count Gismond"" and ""Hervé Riel"" are French"
1164,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"stories. _Paracelsus_ and ""Abt Vogler"" are of German origin."
1165,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"_Balaustion's Adventure_, _Aristophanes' Apology_, ""Pheidippides,"" and"
1166,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""Echetlos"" celebrate Greek thought and adventure. Very important poems"
1167,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"such as ""Saul"" and ""Rabbi Ben Ezra,"" have to do with Jewish life. And"
1168,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"unlike Shakespeare, who is not concerned with making Julius Cæsar a"
1169,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Roman or Duke Theseus a Greek, Browning brings to the creation of each"
1170,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of these widely divergent characters, a detailed knowledge of the"
1171,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,special habits of life and thought of the nation or race concerned. He
1172,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,represents also many kinds of human interest. We find in his poems
1173,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"seekers after knowledge such as Paracelsus, who takes all thought and"
1174,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"fact as his domain; or such as the Grammarian, who found Greek particles"
1175,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"too wide a realm; or such as the pedant Sibrandus Schafnaburgensis,"
1176,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,whose learned rubbish cumbers the land. There are likewise those who
1177,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,grope after the truths of religion from Caliban on his island to the
1178,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,learned physician Karshish and the highly cultured Cleon; those who have
1179,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the full vision from John to Rabbi Ben Ezra; those who juggle with terms
1180,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,and creeds as does Bishop Blougram; and out and out frauds like Sludge
1181,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the Medium. The church is represented by many men dissimilar in
1182,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"endowments, tastes, spiritual experiences, and aims. There are Italian"
1183,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"prelates of every sort, from the worldly-minded Bishop of St. Praxed's,"
1184,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"occupied in death with vain thoughts of lapis-lazuli and pure Latin, to"
1185,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the ""soldier-saint,"" Caponsacchi, who saved Pompilia, and the wise old"
1186,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Pope who pronounced Guido's doom; from the unworthy priest in the
1187,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Spanish Cloister to the very human, kindly Pope in ""The Bean Feast."" And"
1188,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,from all these it is far down the ages to the evangelical parish priest
1189,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of _The Inn Album_, that ""purblind honest drudge,"" who, the deeper to"
1190,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"impress his flock, painted heaven dimly but ""made hell distinct."" There"
1191,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"are many artists, many musicians. There are poets from Aprile in"
1192,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"_Paracelsus_, and the troubadours Eglamour and Sordello, to Keats and"
1193,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Shelley. The extremes of social life are given. There are the
1194,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,street-girls in _Pippa Passes_ and there are kings and queens with royal
1195,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"retinues. There are statesmen, and warriors, and seekers after romantic"
1196,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"adventure. There are haughty aristocrats of cold and cruel natures, and"
1197,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,there are obscure but high-hearted doers of heroic deeds. Browning's
1198,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"dictum, ""Study man, man, whatever the issue,"" led him into a world wider"
1199,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"than that known by any other poet of his time, and akin, as has been"
1200,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"pointed out, to that of the great writers of fiction. As an observer of"
1201,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"human life he was not unlike his poor poet of Valladolid who, with his"
1202,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""scrutinizing hat,"" went about the streets, absorbed in watching all"
1203,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"kinds of people, all sorts of occupations, ""scenting the world, looking"
1204,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"it full in the face."" He chose to set forth ""the wants and ways"" of"
1205,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"actual life. He summed up his work in the ""Epilogue to Pacchiarotto"":"
1206,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1207,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Man's thoughts and loves and hates!
1208,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Earth is my vineyard, these grew there:"
1209,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,From grape of the ground I made or marred
1210,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,My vintage.
1211,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1212,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,It is further apparent that Browning's characters are never merely
1213,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"types, but must always be reckoned with as individuals. It was his"
1214,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,belief that no two beings were ever made similar in head and heart;
1215,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"hence, even where there are external similarities the essential elements"
1216,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"are strongly differentiated. Take, for instance, three poems in which"
1217,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the situations are not unlike. In ""My Last Duchess,"" ""The Flight of the"
1218,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Duchess,"" and _The Ring and the Book_, we have a portrayal of three men"
1219,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of high lineage, but cold, egotistic, cruel, who have married very young"
1220,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,and lovely women over whom the custom of the times gives them absolute
1221,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,power. But there the likeness ends. We cannot for a moment class
1222,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"together the polished, aesthetic, well-bred aristocrat of the first"
1223,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"poem, the absurd little popinjay of the second, and the ""tiger-cat"" of"
1224,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the third. Less strongly, but as clearly are the wives differentiated."
1225,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"To the innocent gaiety of heart, the bright, sweet friendliness of the"
1226,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"hapless lady in ""My Last Duchess"" must be added for the lady in ""The"
1227,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Flight of the Duchess"" a native force of character which, when roused by"
1228,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the call of the gypsy-queen, enables her to break the yoke imposed on"
1229,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"her by the Duke and his mother and go forth into a life of adventure,"
1230,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"freedom, and love. The delicate, flower-like Pompilia in _The Ring and"
1231,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the Book_ has also power to initiate and carry through a plan of escape,"
1232,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,but her incentive is no call to romantic freedom. Her passive endurance
1233,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,changes to active revolt only when motive and energy are supplied by her
1234,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"love for her child. Or take Pippa and Phene in _Pippa Passes_, two"
1235,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"beautiful young girls brought up in dangerous and evil surroundings, but"
1236,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"both innately pure. In character and experience they are, however, as"
1237,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"unlike as two girls could be. Phene, undeveloped in mind and heart, the"
1238,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"easily duped agent of a cruel trick, appeals to us by her slow,"
1239,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"incredulous, but eager response to goodness and aspiration, the"
1240,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"tremulous opening of her soul to love. But Pippa, with her observant"
1241,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"love of nature, her gay, sportive, winsome fancies, her imaginative"
1242,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"sympathy with the lives of others, her knowledge of good and evil, her"
1243,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"poise, her bright steadiness of soul, carries us into a different and"
1244,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,much more highly evolved world of thought and feeling. So we might go
1245,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,through the great assemblage of Browning's characters to find that each
1246,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"one stands out by himself as a person with his own qualities,"
1247,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"possibilities, and problems."
1248,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1249,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,In all this portrayal of individuals the emphasis is on things of the
1250,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,mind and heart. In these realms Browning found nothing alien or
1251,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,uninteresting. From point to point his poetry illustrates what he said
1252,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"in his comment on _Sordello_, ""My stress lay on the incidents in the"
1253,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"development of a human soul; little else is worth study."" In all his"
1254,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,poetry environment is of importance only in so far as it is the stuff on
1255,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"which the soul works. It is ""the subtle thing called spirit,"" it is ""the"
1256,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"soul's world"" to which he devotes himself."
1257,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1258,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,It is only from a study of Browning's many characters that we may arrive
1259,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,at a statement of some of the distinguishing features of his philosophy
1260,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,of life. And any such statements must be made with extreme caution
1261,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,because of his dramatic method. He utters this caution himself when he
1262,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"says of his poems, ""Their contents are always dramatic in principle, and"
1263,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"so many utterances of so many imaginary people."" Yet it is possible, by"
1264,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"taking the general trend and scope of his work, to make justifiable"
1265,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,deductions concerning the dominant ideas in the rich field of his poetry
1266,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,and drama.
1267,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1268,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"In Browning's philosophy of life, words of especial significance are"
1269,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""growth"" and ""progress."" Domizia in _Luria_ says:"
1270,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1271,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,How inexhaustibly the spirit grows!
1272,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"One object, she seemed erewhile born to reach"
1273,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,With her whole energies and die content--
1274,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"So like a wall at the world's edge is stood,"
1275,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,With naught beyond to live for--is that reached?--
1276,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Already are new undreamed energies
1277,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Outgrowing under, and extending farther"
1278,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,To a new object.
1279,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1280,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"So, too, John in ""A Death in the Desert"" sums up his belief in the line,"
1281,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1282,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"I say that man was made to grow, not stop."
1283,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1284,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Growth here and growth hereafter are the essential elements of
1285,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Browning's creed. And there is no other poet in whom all kinds of
1286,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,thinking and doing are so uniformly tested by their outcome in the
1287,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,growth of the soul. Does joy stimulate to fuller life; does suffering
1288,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,bring out moral qualities; do obstacles develop energy; do sharp
1289,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,temptations become a source of strength and assured soldiership; does
1290,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,knowledge of evil lead to a new exaltation of good; does sin lead to
1291,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,self-knowledge and so to regeneration? Then all these are ministers of
1292,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"grace, for through them the soul has reached greater heights and fuller"
1293,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"life. Whatever bids the soul ""nor stand nor sit, but go"" is to be"
1294,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"welcomed. The cost of this growth may be great, but the advances of"
1295,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"spirit are represented as worth any sacrifice. The lady in ""The Flight"
1296,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of the Duchess"" goes from splendor and ease to hardship and obscurity,"
1297,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,but she wins freedom of thought and of act and the opportunity to test
1298,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the qualities of her soul. In _Pippa Passes_ Sebald might have had love
1299,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"and wealth, Jules might have attained fame along the conventional path"
1300,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"marked out for him by the Monsignor, Luigi had the prospect of an easy"
1301,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"life and happy love, the Monsignor might have had enhanced honor from"
1302,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the church into whose coffers he could have turned great revenues. But
1303,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,instead each responds in turn to Pippa's songs; Sebald gains a true view
1304,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of sin, Jules gets a new conception of service and attainment, Luigi's"
1305,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,wavering purpose of self-sacrifice for his country's good is
1306,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"strengthened, the Monsignor is held back from connivance at a crime. In"
1307,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,all these cases the external loss is as nothing compared to the gain in
1308,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,spiritual knowledge and energy.
1309,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1310,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Contact with magnetic and superior personalities is a way of growth
1311,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"particularly noted by Browning. There are men, he says, who bring new"
1312,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"feeling fresh from God, and whose life ""reteaches us what life should"
1313,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"be, what faith is, loyalty and simpleness."" Pompilia says of"
1314,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Caponsacchi:
1315,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1316,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Through such souls alone
1317,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,God stooping shows sufficient of his light
1318,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,For us i' the dark to rise by.
1319,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1320,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"The highest souls are ""seers"" in the noblest sense and they ""impart the"
1321,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"gift of seeing to the rest."" But the helpful personality need not be"
1322,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,great in knowledge or rank. In Pippa Browning emphasizes the power of
1323,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,unconscious goodness in clarifying the spiritual vision of others and in
1324,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,thus stimulating to right action. And in David he shows the power of
1325,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"poetic charm, innocence, and eager love to drive away from another heart"
1326,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,a mood of black despair.
1327,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1328,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"But outside influences are, after all, says Browning, of secondary"
1329,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"importance. They can, at best, do no more than stimulate and guide. When"
1330,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Andrea del Sarto attributes his general lowering of ideals and power to
1331,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the influence of Lucrezia, he evades the real issue. Incentives must"
1332,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,come from the soul's self. Growth is dependent on personal struggle. Man
1333,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"is, by his very nature,"
1334,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1335,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"forced to try and make, else fail to grow--"
1336,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Formed to rise, reach at, if not grasp and gain"
1337,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,The good beyond him--which attempt is growth.
1338,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1339,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"So, also, is it better that youth"
1340,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1341,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"should strive, through acts uncouth,"
1342,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Toward making, than repose on aught found made."
1343,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1344,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,It is in the independence and originality of such striving that the soul
1345,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,discovers and frees its innate potentialities.
1346,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1347,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,An inevitable corollary of this idea of progress is the emphasis put
1348,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"upon aspiration as a habit of the mind. The pursuit of an ideal, a"
1349,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"divine discontent with present accomplishment, are enjoined upon man."
1350,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,The gleams of heaven on earth are not meant to be permanent or
1351,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"satisfying, but only to sting man into hunger for full light. When a"
1352,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,human being has achieved to the full extent of his perceptions or
1353,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"aspirations, he has, thinks Browning, met with the greatest possible"
1354,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"disaster, that of arrested development. Man's powers should ever climb"
1355,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"new heights. For his soul's health he should always see ""a flying point"
1356,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of bliss remote, a happiness in store afar, a sphere of distant glory."""
1357,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"""
1358,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"According to this ideal, man's conception of good is ever changing and"
1359,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,ever widening and hence never in this life to be fully attained; yet the
1360,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,condition of growth is that he have an unmeasured thirst for good and
1361,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,that he pursue it with unquenchable ardor.
1362,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1363,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,The importance of love as one of the most effective agencies in
1364,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,spiritual growth is stated and restated in Browning's poetry and by
1365,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,exceedingly diverse characters. The Queen in _In a Balcony_ turns away
1366,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"from her lonely splendor to exclaim,"
1367,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1368,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,There is no good of life but love--but love!
1369,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,What else looks good is some shade flung from love;
1370,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Love gilds it, gives it worth."
1371,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1372,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,The Duchess learns from the gypsy
1373,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1374,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,How love is the only good in the world.
1375,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1376,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"The famous singer in ""Dis Aliter Visum"" knows that art, verse, music,"
1377,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"count as naught beside ""love found, gained, and kept."" Browning seems to"
1378,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,regard almost any genuine love as a means of opening out the nature to
1379,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"fuller self-knowledge, to wider sympathies, and to increased power of"
1380,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"action. Hence he condemns all cautious calculation of obstacles, all"
1381,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"dwelling upon conventional difficulties, in the path of those who have"
1382,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"clearly seen ""the love-way."" Hence even love unrequited is counted of"
1383,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"inestimable value. In _Colombe's Birthday_ Valence says,"
1384,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1385,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Is the knowledge of her, naught? the memory, naught?"
1386,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"--Lady, should such an one have looked on you,"
1387,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Ne'er wrong yourself so far as quote the world
1388,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"And say, love can go unrequited here!"
1389,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,You will have blessed him to his whole life's end--
1390,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Low passions hindered, baser cares kept back,"
1391,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,All goodness cherished where you dwelt--and dwell.
1392,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1393,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,But the love of man and woman is not the only sort. A part of the value
1394,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,of this individual relationship is that it may be regarded as a
1395,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,revelation and symbol of the spirit of all-embracing sympathy whereby
1396,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,mankind should be ruled. When Paracelsus analyzes his life he ascribes
1397,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,his failure to the fact that he has sought knowledge to the exclusion of
1398,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"all else; he finally came to see that knowledge, however profound, is of"
1399,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,itself barren of satisfaction. He had meant to serve men by revealing
1400,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"truth to them, but he found that real service is based on the"
1401,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"understanding given by love. In self condemnation he says,"
1402,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1403,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,In my own heart love had not been made wise
1404,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"To trace love's faint beginnings in mankind,"
1405,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,To know even hate is but a mask of love's.
1406,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"To see a good in evil, and a hope"
1407,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"In ill-success; to sympathize, be proud"
1408,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Of their half-reasons, faint aspirings, dim"
1409,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Struggles for truth, their poorest fallacies,"
1410,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Their prejudice and fears and cares and doubts;
1411,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"All with a touch of nobleness, despite"
1412,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Their error, upward tending all though weak."
1413,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1414,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Browning's conception of the function and power of love is based on his
1415,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"belief in its divine origin. Twice at least, in ""Easter Day"" and ""Saul,"""
1416,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,his characters work out from an overpowering recognition of God's
1417,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,omniscience and omnipotence to a final recognition that his love is
1418,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,equal in scope with his power and knowledge. And he counts human service
1419,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"as most complete when, as in David before Saul, it reaches out to God's"
1420,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,love and recruits its failing forces from the divine source.
1421,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1422,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Underlying Browning's doctrine of the value of love, and his doctrine of"
1423,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"progress and aspiration, is his belief in personal immortality. When he"
1424,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"was charged with being strongly against Darwin, with rejecting the"
1425,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"truths of science and regretting its advance, he answered that the idea"
1426,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,of a progressive development from senseless matter until man's
1427,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"appearance had been a familiar conception to him from the beginning, but"
1428,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,he reiterated his constant faith in creative intelligence acting on
1429,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"matter but not resulting from it. ""Soul,"" he said, ""is not matter, nor"
1430,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"from matter, but above."" Two assumptions which though not susceptible of"
1431,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"proof he regards as ""inescapable,"" are the existence of creative"
1432,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"intelligence and of ""the subtle thing called spirit."" When he argues out"
1433,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the question of the immortality of this spirit, as in _La Saisiaz_, he"
1434,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,admits the subjective character of the evidence; but when he speaks
1435,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"spontaneously out of his own feeling or experience, it is with positive"
1436,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"belief in life after death. To Mr. Sharp he said, ""Death, death! It is"
1437,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"this harping on death that I do despise so much! Why, _amico mio_, you"
1438,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"know as well as I that death is life, just as our daily, our momentarily"
1439,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,dying body is none the less alive and ever recruiting new forces of
1440,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,existence. Without death which is our crape-like church-yardy word for
1441,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"change, for growth, there could be no prolongation of what we call life."
1442,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Pshaw, it is foolish to argue upon such a thing, even. For myself, I"
1443,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"deny death as an end of everything. Never say of me that I am dead!"""
1444,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"When his wife died he wrote in her Testament these words from Dante,"
1445,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""Thus I believe, thus I affirm, thus I am certain it is, that from this"
1446,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,life I shall pass to another better there where that lady lives of whom
1447,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"my soul was enamored."" This faith in life after death explains much of"
1448,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,Browning's philosophy. The source of the pagan Cleon's profound
1449,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,discouragement was the fact that man should be dowered with
1450,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""joy-hunger,"" should be given the ability to perceive and comprehend"
1451,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"splendor and breadth of experience, but should, through the straitness"
1452,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"of human limitations, be held back from satisfaction and achievement,"
1453,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"and should be left to die thus dazzled, thus baffled. The secret of"
1454,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Browning's optimism, on the other hand, is his belief that in heaven"
1455,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"the soul is freed from limitations, and blossoms out into capabilities"
1456,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,of joy and of activity beyond anything suggested by the most golden
1457,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"dreams of earth. To him all life is a unit, beginning here and destined"
1458,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,to unimaginable development hereafter. Earth is regarded as a place of
1459,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,tutelage where man may learn to set foot on some one path to heaven. And
1460,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,no work begun here shall ever pause for death. Even apparent failure
1461,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"here counts for little so the quest be not abandoned. Each of us may, as"
1462,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Abt Vogler, look without despair on the broken arcs of earth if his"
1463,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,faith reveals the perfect round in heaven.
1464,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1465,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,From any prolonged study of Browning's poetry we become conscious of
1466,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,certain dominant qualities of style that may be thought of quite apart
1467,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,from his themes or message. That his style has the defect of its
1468,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,qualities has already been pointed out. Here we may appropriately
1469,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"indicate those qualities as positive elements of his power. His diction,"
1470,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"rich alike in the most learned words and the most colloquial, is"
1471,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,responsive to all demands. His power of phrasing runs the whole gamut
1472,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,from the most pellucid simplicity to the most triumphant originality.
1473,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"His figures of speech, drawn from all realms, are penetrating in"
1474,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"quality, of startling aptness. Equally characteristic is his"
1475,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"versification, varying as it does from passages of melodic smoothness"
1476,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"and grace to lines as strident, broken, and harsh as the thought they"
1477,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"dramatically reflect. In narration, whether in the brilliant rapidity"
1478,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"and ease of a short poem like ""Hervé Riel"" or in the sustained flow of a"
1479,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"long story like that of Pompilia, we find unusual skill. In"
1480,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"disquisition, in the presentation of complicated and elusive"
1481,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"intellectual processes, there is a quite unmatched agility and"
1482,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,dexterity. Probably no two forms of poetry contain more of Browning's
1483,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"most noteworthy work than the lyric, especially the reflective love"
1484,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"lyric, and that form which is distinctively his own, the dramatic"
1485,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,monologue. In his best poems in this last form he has no competitor. It
1486,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,is in the presentation of character through the medium of dramatic
1487,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,monologue that he most fully reveals the unerring precision of his
1488,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"analysis, his lightning glance into the heart of a mystery, the ease"
1489,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,with which he tracks a motive or mood or thought to its last hiding
1490,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"place, and his consequent passion and fire of sympathy or scorn."
1491,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1492,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"Finally, whether we consider Browning's style or subject matter or"
1493,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"philosophy of life, we become growingly conscious of his force. The"
1494,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"""clear Virgilian line"" of Tennyson is the outcome of a nature"
1495,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,instinctively aristocratic and aloof. Browning is out in the thick of
1496,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the fight and almost vociferously demands a hearing. Whatever makes his
1497,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"thought clear, vivid, active, forcible, seems to him, however prosaic it"
1498,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"may appear at first glance, proper poetic material. The immediate effect"
1499,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,of his verse is the rousing of the mind to great issues. His tremendous
1500,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"sincerity results in a dispelling of mists, a stripping off of husks."
1501,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,His demand for the truth is a trumpet note of challenge to our doubt or
1502,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,fear or indifference. His penetrating study of human problems leads to
1503,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,an inevitable widening of the horizon of comprehension and sympathy on
1504,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,the part of his readers. And his courage and optimism constitute an
1505,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,inspiration and stimulus of an uncommonly virile sort.
1506,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,
1507,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"It has been said that Browning is ""not a poet, but a literature,"" and in"
1508,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,work so vast and varied that it can be thus characterized there must be
1509,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,wide extremes of value. It is almost certain that portions of his work
1510,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"cannot live. They are too difficult, too unliterary. But in the portions"
1511,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,"where great thought finds adequate form, the product is a priceless gift"
1512,THE POETRY OF BROWNING,and one not equaled by any other poet of his age.

4004,III,For dolts that can't or won't determine
4005,III,What's best to rid us of our vermin!

4019,IV,"""For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell,"
4020,IV,I wish I were a mile hence!

4042,V,And in did come the strangest figure!
4043,V,His queer long coat from heel to head
4044,V,"Was half of yellow and half of red,"
4045,V,"And he himself was tall and thin,"
4046,V,"With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,                             60"
4047,V,"And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,"
4048,V,"No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,"

4066,VI,And I chiefly use my charm
4067,VI,"On creatures that do people harm,"
4068,VI,The mole and toad and newt and viper;
4069,VI,"And people call me the Pied Piper."""
4070,VI,(And here they noticed round his neck                              80
4071,VI,"A scarf of red and yellow stripe,"
4072,VI,To match with his coat of the self-same check;
4073,VI,And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;
4074,VI,"And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying"
4075,VI,As if impatient to be playing                                      85
4076,VI,"Upon this pipe, as low it dangled"

4080,VI,"Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats;                        90"
4081,VI,I eased in Asia the Nizam
4082,VI,Of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats:

4084,VI,If I can rid your town of rats
4085,VI,"Will you give me a thousand guilders?""                             95"

4095,VII,In his quiet pipe the while;
4096,VII,"Then, like a musical adept,"
4097,VII,"To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,"
4098,VII,"And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,"
4099,VII,Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;                      105
4100,VII,"And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,"
4101,VII,You heard as if an army muttered;
4102,VII,And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
4103,VII,And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
4104,VII,And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.                     110
4105,VII,"Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,"
4106,VII,"Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,"
4107,VII,"Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,"
4108,VII,"Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,"
4109,VII,"Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,                              115"
4110,VII,"Families by tens and dozens,"
4111,VII,"Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--"
4112,VII,Followed the Piper for their lives.
4113,VII,"From street to street he piped advancing,"
4114,VII,"And step for step they followed dancing,                          120"
4115,VII,"Until they came to the river Weser,"
4116,VII,Wherein all plunged and perished!
4117,VII,"--Save one who, stout as Julius Cæsar,"
4118,VII,Swam across and lived to carry
4119,VII,"(As he, the manuscript he cherished)                            125"
4120,VII,To Rat-land home his commentary:
4121,VII,"Which was, ""At the first shrill notes of the pipe,"
4122,VII,"I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,"
4123,VII,"And putting apples, wondrous ripe,"
4124,VII,Into a cider-press's gripe:                                       130
4125,VII,"And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,"
4126,VII,"And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,"
4127,VII,"And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,"
4128,VII,And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:
4129,VII,And it seemed as if a voice                                       135

4234,XIII,As the Piper turned from the High Street
4235,XIII,To where the Weser rolled its waters
4236,XIII,Right in the way of their sons and daughters!
4237,XIII,"However he turned from South to West,"
4238,XIII,"And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,                       220"
4239,XIII,And after him the children pressed;
4240,XIII,Great was the joy in every breast.
4241,XIII,"""He never can cross that mighty top!"
4242,XIII,"He's forced to let the piping drop,"
4243,XIII,"And we shall see our children stop!""                              225"
4244,XIII,"When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side,"
4245,XIII,"A wondrous portal opened wide,"
4246,XIII,As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
4247,XIII,"And the Piper advanced and the children followed,"
4248,XIII,"And when all were in to the very last,                            230"
4249,XIII,The door in the mountain-side shut fast.
4250,XIII,"Did I say, all? No! One was lame,"
4251,XIII,And could not dance the whole of the way;
4252,XIII,"And in after years, if you would blame"
4253,XIII,"His sadness, he was used to say--                               235"
4254,XIII,"""It's dull in our town since my playmates left!"
4255,XIII,I can't forget that I'm bereft
4256,XIII,"Of all the pleasant sights they see,"
4257,XIII,Which the Piper also promised me.
4258,XIII,"For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,                         240"
4259,XIII,"Joining the town and just at hand,"
4260,XIII,Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew
4261,XIII,"And flowers put forth a fairer hue,"
4262,XIII,And everything was strange and new;
4263,XIII,"The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,                    245"
4264,XIII,"And their dogs outran our fallow deer,"
4265,XIII,"And honey-bees had lost their stings,"
4266,XIII,And horses were born with eagles' wings:
4267,XIII,And just as I became assured
4268,XIII,"My lame foot would be speedily cured,                             250"
4269,XIII,"The music stopped and I stood still,"
4270,XIII,"And found myself outside the hill,"
4271,XIII,"Left alone against my will,"
4272,XIII,"To go now limping as before,"
4273,XIII,"And never hear of that country more!""                             255"
4274,XIII,
4275,XIII,
4276,XIV,XIV
4277,XIV,
4278,XIV,"Alas, alas for Hamelin!"
4279,XIV,There came into many a burgher's pate
4280,XIV,A text which says that heaven's gate
4281,XIV,Opes to the rich at as easy rate
4282,XIV,As the needle's eye takes a camel in!                             260
4283,XIV,"The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,"
4284,XIV,"To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,"
4285,XIV,"Wherever it was men's lot to find him,"
4286,XIV,"Silver and gold to his heart's content,"
4287,XIV,"If he'd only return the way he went,                              265"
4288,XIV,And bring the children behind him.
4289,XIV,"But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavor,"
4290,XIV,"And Piper and dancers were gone forever,"
4291,XIV,They made a decree that lawyers never
4292,XIV,Should think their records dated duly                           270
4293,XIV,"If, after the day of the month and year,"
4294,XIV,"These words did not as well appear,"
4295,XIV,"""And so long after what happened here"
4296,XIV,"On the Twenty-second of July,"
4297,XIV,"Thirteen hundred and seventy-six"";                                275"
4298,XIV,And the better in memory to fix
4299,XIV,"The place of the children's last retreat,"
4300,XIV,They called it the Pied Piper's Street--
4301,XIV,Where anyone playing on pipe or tabor
4302,XIV,Was sure for the future to lose his labor.                        280
4303,XIV,Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern
4304,XIV,To shock with mirth a street so solemn;
4305,XIV,But opposite the place of the cavern
4306,XIV,"They wrote the story on a column,"
4307,XIV,And on the great church-window painted                            285
4308,XIV,"The same, to make the world acquainted"
4309,XIV,"How their children were stolen away,"
4310,XIV,And there it stands to this very day.
4311,XIV,And I must not omit to say
4312,XIV,That in Transylvania there's a tribe                              290
4313,XIV,Of alien people who ascribe
4314,XIV,The outlandish ways and dress
4315,XIV,"On which their neighbors lay such stress,"
4316,XIV,To their fathers and mothers having risen
4317,XIV,Out of some subterraneous prison                                  295
4318,XIV,Into which they were trepanned
4319,XIV,Long time ago in a mighty band
4320,XIV,"Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,"
4321,XIV,"But how or why, they don't understand."
4322,XIV,
4323,XIV,
4324,XV,XV
4325,XV,
4326,XV,"So, Willy, let me and you be wipers                               300"
4327,XV,Of scores out with all men--especially pipers!
4328,XV,"And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,"
4329,XV,"If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise!"

4338,I,
4339,I,You're my friend:
4340,I,I was the man the Duke spoke to;
4341,I,"I helped the Duchess to cast off his yoke, too;"
4342,I,"So here's the tale from beginning to end,"
4343,I,My friend!                                                          5
4344,I,
4345,I,
4346,II,II
4347,II,
4348,II,Ours is a great wild country:
4349,II,"If you climb to our castle's top,"
4350,II,I don't see where your eye can stop;
4351,II,"For when you've passed the cornfield country,"
4352,II,"Where vineyards leave off, flocks are packed,                      10"
4353,II,"And sheep-range leads to cattle-tract,"
4354,II,"And cattle-tract to open-chase,"
4355,II,And open-chase to the very base
4356,II,"Of the mountain where, at a funeral pace,"
4357,II,"Round about, solemn and slow,                                      15"
4358,II,"One by one, row after row,"
4359,II,"Up and up the pine-trees go,"
4360,II,"So, like black priests up, and so"
4361,II,Down the other side again
4362,II,"To another greater, wilder country,                              20"
4363,II,"That's one vast red drear burnt-up plain,"
4364,II,Branched through and through with many a vein
4365,II,"Whence iron's dug, and copper's dealt;"
4366,II,"Look right, look left, look straight before--"
4367,II,"Beneath they mine, above they smelt,                               25"
4368,II,"Copper-ore and iron-ore,"
4369,II,And forge and furnace mold and melt
4370,II,"And so on, more and ever more,"
4371,II,"Till at the last, for a bounding belt,"
4372,II,"Comes the salt sand hoar of the great seashore,                  30"
4373,II,--And the whole is our Duke's country.
4374,II,
4375,II,
4376,III,III
4377,III,
4378,III,I was born the day this present Duke was--
4379,III,"(And O, says the song, ere I was old!)"
4380,III,In the castle where the other Duke was--
4381,III,"(When I was happy and young, not old!)                           35"
4382,III,"I in the kennel, he in the bower:"
4383,III,We are of like age to an hour.
4384,III,My father was huntsman in that day;
4385,III,Who has not heard my father say
4386,III,"That, when a boar was brought to bay,                              40"
4387,III,"Three times, four times out of five,"
4388,III,With his huntspear he'd contrive
4389,III,"To get the killing-place transfixed,"
4390,III,"And pin him true, both eyes betwixt?"
4391,III,And that's why the old Duke would rather                           45
4392,III,"He lost a salt-pit than my father,"
4393,III,And loved to have him ever in call;
4394,III,That's why my father stood in the hall
4395,III,When the old Duke brought his infant out
4396,III,"To show the people, and while they passed                        50"
4397,III,"The wondrous bantling round about,"
4398,III,Was first to start at the outside blast
4399,III,"As the Kaiser's courier blew his horn,"
4400,III,Just a month after the babe was born.
4401,III,"""And,"" quoth the Kaiser's courier, ""since                          55"
4402,III,"The Duke has got an heir, our Prince"
4403,III,"Needs the Duke's self at his side"";"
4404,III,"The Duke looked down and seemed to wince,"
4405,III,"But he thought of wars o'er the world wide,"
4406,III,"Castles a-fire, men on their march,                                60"
4407,III,"The toppling tower, the crashing arch;"
4408,III,"And up he looked, and awhile he eyed"
4409,III,The row of crests and shields and banners
4410,III,"Of all achievements after all manners,"
4411,III,"And ""aye,"" said the Duke with a surly pride.                     65"
4412,III,The more was his comfort when he died
4413,III,"At next year's end, in a velvet suit,"
4414,III,"With a gilt glove on his hand, his foot"
4415,III,"In a silken shoe for a leather boot,"
4416,III,"Petticoated like a herald,                                         70"
4417,III,"In a chamber next to an ante-room,"
4418,III,"Where he breathed the breath of page and groom,"
4419,III,"What he called stink, and they, perfume:"
4420,III,--They should have set him on red Berold
4421,III,"Mad with pride, like fire to manage!                               75"
4422,III,They should have got his cheek fresh tannage
4423,III,Such a day as today in the merry sunshine!
4424,III,Had they stuck on his fist a rough-foot merlin!
4425,III,"(Hark, the wind's on the heath at its game!"
4426,III,"Oh, for a noble falcon-lanner                                      80"
4427,III,"To flap each broad wing like a banner,"
4428,III,"And turn in the wind, and dance like flame!)"
4429,III,Had they broached a white-beer cask from Berlin
4430,III,--Or if you incline to prescribe mere wine
4431,III,"Put to his lips, when they saw him pine,                           85"
4432,III,"A cup of our own Moldavia fine,"
4433,III,"Cotnar for instance, green as May sorrel"
4434,III,And ropy with sweet--we shall not quarrel.
4435,III,
4436,III,
4437,IV,IV
4438,IV,
4439,IV,"So, at home, the sick, tall, yellow Duchess"
4440,IV,"Was left with the infant in her clutches,                          90"
4441,IV,She being the daughter of God knows who:
4442,IV,And now was the time to revisit her tribe.
4443,IV,"Abroad and afar they went, the two,"
4444,IV,And let our people rail and gibe
4445,IV,"At the empty hall and extinguished fire,                           95"
4446,IV,"As loud as we liked, but ever in vain,"
4447,IV,"Till after long years we had our desire,"
4448,IV,And back came the Duke and his mother again.
4449,IV,
4450,IV,
4451,V,V
4452,V,
4453,V,And he came back the pertest little ape
4454,V,That ever affronted human shape;                                  100
4455,V,"Full of his travel, struck at himself."
4456,V,You'd say he despised our bluff old ways?
4457,V,--Not he! For in Paris they told the elf
4458,V,"Our rough North land was the Land of Lays,"
4459,V,The one good thing left in evil days;                           105
4460,V,"Since the Mid-Age was the Heroic Time,"
4461,V,And only in wild nooks like ours
4462,V,"Could you taste of it yet as in its prime,"
4463,V,"And see true castles, with proper towers,"
4464,V,"Young-hearted women, old-minded men,                              110"
4465,V,And manners now as manners were then.
4466,V,"So, all that the old Dukes had been, without knowing it,"
4467,V,"This Duke would fain know he was, without being it;"
4468,V,"'Twas not for the joy's self, but the joy of his showing it,"
4469,V,"Nor for the pride's self, but the pride of our seeing it,         115"
4470,V,"He revived all usages thoroughly worn-out,"
4471,V,"The souls of them fumed-forth, the hearts of them torn-out:"
4472,V,And chief in the chase his neck he periled
4473,V,"On a lathy horse, all legs and length,"
4474,V,"With blood for bone, all speed, no strength;                      120"
4475,V,--They should have set him on red Berold
4476,V,"With the red eye slow consuming in fire,"
4477,V,And the thin stiff ear like an abbey-spire!
4478,V,
4479,V,
4480,VI,VI
4481,VI,
4482,VI,"Well, such as he was, he must marry, we heard:"
4483,VI,"And out of a convent, at the word,                                125"
4484,VI,Came the lady in time of spring.
4485,VI,"--Oh, old thoughts they cling, they cling!"
4486,VI,"That day, I know, with a dozen oaths"
4487,VI,I clad myself in thick hunting-clothes
4488,VI,Fit for the chase of urochs or buffle                             130
4489,VI,In winter-time when you need to muffle.
4490,VI,"But the Duke had a mind we should cut a figure,"
4491,VI,And so we saw the lady arrive:
4492,VI,"My friend, I have seen a white crane bigger!"
4493,VI,"She was the smallest lady alive,                                135"
4494,VI,"Made in a piece of nature's madness,"
4495,VI,"Too small, almost, for the life and gladness"
4496,VI,"That overfilled her, as some hive"
4497,VI,Out of the bears' reach on the high trees
4498,VI,"Is crowded with its safe, merry bees:                             140"
4499,VI,"In truth, she was not hard to please!"
4500,VI,"Up she looked, down she looked, round at the mead,"
4501,VI,"Straight at the castle, that's best indeed"
4502,VI,To look at from outside the walls;
4503,VI,"As for us, styled the ""serfs and thralls,""                        145"
4504,VI,"She as much thanked me as if she had said it,"
4505,VI,"(With her eyes, do you understand?)"
4506,VI,Because I patted her horse while I led it;
4507,VI,"And Max, who rode on her other hand,"
4508,VI,"Said, no bird flew past but she inquired                          150"
4509,VI,"What its true name was, nor ever seemed tired--"
4510,VI,"If that was an eagle she saw hover,"
4511,VI,And the green and gray bird on the field was the plover.
4512,VI,When suddenly appeared the Duke:
4513,VI,"And as down she sprung, the small foot pointed                  155"
4514,VI,"On to my hand--as with a rebuke,"
4515,VI,"And as if his backbone were not jointed,"
4516,VI,"The Duke stepped rather aside than forward,"
4517,VI,And welcomed her with his grandest smile;
4518,VI,"And, mind you, his mother all the while                         160"
4519,VI,"Chilled in the rear, like a wind to Nor'ward;"
4520,VI,"And up, like a weary yawn, with its pulleys"
4521,VI,"Went, in a shriek, the rusty portcullis;"
4522,VI,"And, like a glad sky the north-wind sullies,"
4523,VI,"The lady's face stopped its play,                                 165"
4524,VI,As if her first hair had grown gray;
4525,VI,For such things must begin some one day.
4526,VI,
4527,VI,
4528,VII,VII
4529,VII,
4530,VII,In a day or two she was well again;
4531,VII,"As who should say, ""You labor in vain!"
4532,VII,"This is all a jest against God, who meant                         170"
4533,VII,"I should ever be, as I am, content"
4534,VII,"And glad in His sight; therefore, glad I will be."""
4535,VII,"So, smiling as at first, went she."
4536,VII,
4537,VII,
4538,VIII,VIII
4539,VIII,
4540,VIII,"She was active, stirring, all fire--"
4541,VIII,"Could not rest, could not tire--                                  175"
4542,VIII,To a stone she might have given life!
4543,VIII,"(I myself loved once, in my day)"
4544,VIII,"--For a shepherd's, miner's, huntsman's wife,"
4545,VIII,"(I had a wife, I know what I say)"
4546,VIII,Never in all the world such an one!                               180
4547,VIII,"And here was plenty to be done,"
4548,VIII,"And she that could do it, great or small,"
4549,VIII,She was to do nothing at all.
4550,VIII,"There was already this man in his post,"
4551,VIII,"This in his station, and that in his office,                    185"
4552,VIII,"And the Duke's plan admitted a wife, at most,"
4553,VIII,"To meet his eye, with the other trophies,"
4554,VIII,"Now outside the hall, now in it,"
4555,VIII,"To sit thus, stand thus, see and be seen,"
4556,VIII,"At the proper place in the proper minute,                         190"
4557,VIII,And die away the life between.
4558,VIII,"And it was amusing enough, each infraction"
4559,VIII,Of rule--(but for after-sadness that came)
4560,VIII,To hear the consummate self-satisfaction
4561,VIII,With which the young Duke and the old dame                      195
4562,VIII,"Would let her advise, and criticize,"
4563,VIII,"And, being a fool, instruct the wise,"
4564,VIII,"And, child-like, parcel out praise or blame:"
4565,VIII,"They bore it all in complacent guise,"
4566,VIII,"As though an artificer, after contriving                          200"
4567,VIII,"A wheel-work image as if it were living,"
4568,VIII,Should find with delight it could motion to strike him!
4569,VIII,"So found the Duke, and his mother like him:"
4570,VIII,The lady hardly got a rebuff--
4571,VIII,"That had not been contemptuous enough,                            205"
4572,VIII,"With his cursed smirk, as he nodded applause,"
4573,VIII,And kept off the old mother-cat's claws.
4574,VIII,
4575,VIII,
4576,IX,IX
4577,IX,
4578,IX,"So, the little lady grew silent and thin,"
4579,IX,"Paling and ever paling,"
4580,IX,As the way is with a hid chagrin;                                 210
4581,IX,"And the Duke perceived that she was ailing,"
4582,IX,"And said in his heart, ""'Tis done to spite me,"
4583,IX,"But I shall find in my power to right me!"""
4584,IX,"Don't swear, friend! The old one, many a year,"
4585,IX,"Is in hell, and the Duke's self ... you shall hear.               215"
4586,IX,
4587,IX,
4588,X,X
4589,X,
4590,X,"Well, early in autumn, at first winter-warning,"
4591,X,"When the stag had to break with his foot, of a morning,"
4592,X,A drinking-hole out of the fresh tender ice
4593,X,"That covered the pond till the sun, in a trice,"
4594,X,"Loosening it, let out a ripple of gold,                           220"
4595,X,"And another and another, and faster and faster,"
4596,X,"Till, dimpling to blindness, the wide water rolled;"
4597,X,Then it so chanced that the Duke our master
4598,X,"Asked himself what were the pleasures in season,"
4599,X,"And found, since the calendar bade him be hearty,               225"
4600,X,He should do the Middle Age no treason
4601,X,In resolving on a hunting-party.
4602,X,"Always provided, old books showed the way of it!"
4603,X,What meant old poets by their strictures?
4604,X,"And when old poets had said their say of it,                      230"
4605,X,How taught old painters in their pictures?
4606,X,"We must revert to the proper channels,"
4607,X,"Workings in tapestry, paintings on panels,"
4608,X,And gather up woodcraft's authentic traditions:
4609,X,"Here was food for our various ambitions,                          235"
4610,X,"As on each case, exactly stated--"
4611,X,"To encourage your dog, now, the properest chirrup,"
4612,X,Or best prayer to Saint Hubert on mounting your stirrup--
4613,X,We of the household took thought and debated.
4614,X,Blessed was he whose back ached with the jerkin                   240
4615,X,His sire was wont to do forest-work in;
4616,X,"Blesseder he who nobly sunk ""ohs"""
4617,X,"And ""ahs"" while he tugged on his grandsire's trunk-hose;"
4618,X,"What signified hats if they had no rims on,"
4619,X,"Each slouching before and behind like the scallop,              245"
4620,X,"And able to serve at sea for a shallop,"
4621,X,Loaded with lacquer and looped with crimson?
4622,X,"So that the deer now, to make a short rhyme on't,"
4623,X,"What with our Venerers, Prickers, and Verderers,"
4624,X,"Might hope for real hunters at length and not murderers,        250"
4625,X,"And, oh, the Duke's tailor, he had a hot time on't!"
4626,X,
4627,X,
4628,XI,XI
4629,XI,
4630,XI,Now you must know that when the first dizziness
4631,XI,"Of flap-hats and buff-coats and jack-boots subsided,"
4632,XI,"The Duke put this question, ""The Duke's part provided,"
4633,XI,"Had not the Duchess some share in the business?""                  255"
4634,XI,For out of the mouth of two or three witnesses
4635,XI,Did he establish all fit-or-unfitnesses:
4636,XI,"And, after much laying of heads together,"
4637,XI,Somebody's cap got a notable feather
4638,XI,By the announcement with proper unction                           260
4639,XI,That he had discovered the lady's function;
4640,XI,"Since ancient authors gave this tenet,"
4641,XI,"""When horns wind a mort and the deer is at siege,"
4642,XI,"Let the dame of the castle prick forth on her jennet,"
4643,XI,"And, with water to wash the hands of her liege                  265"
4644,XI,"In a clean ewer with a fair toweling,"
4645,XI,"Let her preside at the disemboweling."""
4646,XI,"Now, my friend, if you had so little religion"
4647,XI,"As to catch a hawk, some falcon-lanner,"
4648,XI,And thrust her broad wings like a banner                        270
4649,XI,Into a coop for a vulgar pigeon;
4650,XI,And if day by day and week by week
4651,XI,"You cut her claws, and sealed her eyes,"
4652,XI,"And clipped her wings, and tied her beak,"
4653,XI,Would it cause you any great surprise                           275
4654,XI,"If, when you decided to give her an airing,"
4655,XI,You found she needed a little preparing?
4656,XI,"--I say, should you be such a curmudgeon,"
4657,XI,"If she clung to the perch, as to take it in dudgeon?"
4658,XI,"Yet when the Duke to his lady signified,                          280"
4659,XI,"Just a day before, as he judged most dignified,"
4660,XI,In what a pleasure she was to participate--
4661,XI,"And, instead of leaping wide in flashes,"
4662,XI,"Her eyes just lifted their long lashes,"
4663,XI,"As if pressed by fatigue even he could not dissipate,             285"
4664,XI,"And duly acknowledged the Duke's forethought,"
4665,XI,"But spoke of her health, if her health were worth aught,"
4666,XI,"Of the weight by day and the watch by night,"
4667,XI,"And much wrong now that used to be right,"
4668,XI,"So, thanking him, declined the hunting--                          290"
4669,XI,Was conduct ever more affronting?
4670,XI,With all the ceremony settled--
4671,XI,"With the towel ready, and the sewer"
4672,XI,"Polishing up his oldest ewer,"
4673,XI,"And the jennet pitched upon, a piebald,                           295"
4674,XI,"Black-barred, cream-coated, and pink eye-balled--"
4675,XI,No wonder if the Duke was nettled!
4676,XI,And when she persisted nevertheless--
4677,XI,"Well, I suppose here's the time to confess"
4678,XI,That there ran half round our lady's chamber                      300
4679,XI,A balcony none of the hardest to clamber;
4680,XI,"And that Jacynth, the tire-woman, ready in waiting,"
4681,XI,"Stayed in call outside, what need of relating?"
4682,XI,"And since Jacynth was like a June rose, why, a fervent"
4683,XI,Adorer of Jacynth of course was your servant;                     305
4684,XI,"And if she had the habit to peep through the casement,"
4685,XI,How could I keep at any vast distance?
4686,XI,"And so, as I say, on the lady's persistence,"
4687,XI,"The Duke, dumb-stricken with amazement,"
4688,XI,"Stood for a while in a sultry smother,                            310"
4689,XI,"And then, with a smile that partook of the awful,"
4690,XI,Turned her over to his yellow mother
4691,XI,To learn what was held decorous and lawful;
4692,XI,"And the mother smelt blood with a cat-like instinct,"
4693,XI,As her cheek quick whitened through all its quince-tinct.         315
4694,XI,"Oh, but the lady heard the whole truth at once!"
4695,XI,"What meant she?--Who was she?--Her duty and station,"
4696,XI,"The wisdom of age and the folly of youth, at once,"
4697,XI,Its decent regard and its fitting relation--
4698,XI,"In brief, my friend, set all the devils in hell free              320"
4699,XI,And turn them out to carouse in a belfry
4700,XI,"And treat the priests to a fifty-part canon,"
4701,XI,And then you may guess how that tongue of hers ran on!
4702,XI,"Well, somehow or other it ended at last"
4703,XI,"And, licking her whiskers, out she passed;                        325"
4704,XI,And after her--making (he hoped) a face
4705,XI,"Like Emperor Nero or Sultan Saladin,"
4706,XI,Stalked the Duke's self with the austere grace
4707,XI,"Of ancient hero or modern paladin,"
4708,XI,"From door to staircase--oh, such a solemn                         330"
4709,XI,Unbending of the vertebral column!
4710,XI,
4711,XI,
4712,XII,XII
4713,XII,
4714,XII,"However, at sunrise our company mustered;"
4715,XII,"And here was the huntsman bidding unkennel,"
4716,XII,"And there 'neath his bonnet the pricker blustered,"
4717,XII,With feather dank as a bough of wet fennel;                     335
4718,XII,For the courtyard walls were filled with fog
4719,XII,You might have cut as an ax chops a log--
4720,XII,Like so much wool for color and bulkiness;
4721,XII,"And out rode the Duke in a perfect sulkiness,"
4722,XII,"Since, before breakfast, a man feels but queasily,                340"
4723,XII,And a sinking at the lower abdomen
4724,XII,Begins the day with indifferent omen.
4725,XII,"And lo, as he looked around uneasily,"
4726,XII,The sun plowed the fog up and drove it asunder
4727,XII,This way and that from the valley under;                          345
4728,XII,"And, looking through the court-yard arch,"
4729,XII,"Down in the valley, what should meet him"
4730,XII,But a troop of gypsies on their march?
4731,XII,No doubt with the annual gifts to greet him.
4732,XII,
4733,XII,
4734,XIII,XIII
4735,XIII,
4736,XIII,"Now, in your land, gypsies reach you only                         350"
4737,XIII,After reaching all lands beside;
4738,XIII,"North they go, South they go, trooping or lonely,"
4739,XIII,"And still, as they travel far and wide,"
4740,XIII,"Catch they and keep now a trace here, a trace there,"
4741,XIII,"That puts you in mind of a place here, a place there              355"
4742,XIII,"But with us, I believe they rise out of the ground,"
4743,XIII,"And nowhere else, I take it, are found"
4744,XIII,With the earth-tint yet so freshly embrowned:
4745,XIII,"Born, no doubt, like insects which breed on"
4746,XIII,The very fruit they are meant to feed on.                         360
4747,XIII,"For the earth--not a use to which they don't turn it,"
4748,XIII,"The ore that grows in the mountain's womb,"
4749,XIII,"Or the sand in the pits like a honeycomb,"
4750,XIII,"They sift and soften it, bake it and burn it--"
4751,XIII,"Whether they weld you, for instance, a snaffle                    365"
4752,XIII,With side-bars never a brute can baffle;
4753,XIII,Or a lock that's a puzzle of wards within wards;
4754,XIII,"Or, if your colt's forefoot inclines to curve inwards,"
4755,XIII,Horseshoes they hammer which turn on a swivel
4756,XIII,And won't allow the hoof to shrivel.                              370
4757,XIII,Then they cast bells like the shell of the winkle
4758,XIII,That keep a stout heart in the ram with their tinkle;
4759,XIII,But the sand--they pinch and pound it like otters;
4760,XIII,Commend me the gypsy glass-makers and potters!
4761,XIII,"Glasses they'll blow you, crystal-clear,                          375"
4762,XIII,"Where just a faint cloud of rose shall appear,"
4763,XIII,As if in pure water you dropped and let die
4764,XIII,A bruised black-blooded mulberry;
4765,XIII,"And that other sort, their crowning pride,"
4766,XIII,"With long white threads distinct inside,                          380"
4767,XIII,Like the lake-flower's fibrous roots which dangle
4768,XIII,"Loose such a length and never tangle,"
4769,XIII,"Where the bold sword-lily cuts the clear waters,"
4770,XIII,And the cup-lily couches with all the white daughters:
4771,XIII,"Such are the works they put their hand to,                        385"
4772,XIII,The uses they turn and twist iron and sand to.
4773,XIII,"And these made the troop, which our Duke saw sally"
4774,XIII,"Toward his castle from out of the valley,"
4775,XIII,"Men and women, like new-hatched spiders,"
4776,XIII,Come out with the morning to greet our riders.                    390
4777,XIII,"And up they wound till they reached the ditch,"
4778,XIII,"Whereat all stopped save one, a witch"
4779,XIII,"That I knew, as she hobbled from the group,"
4780,XIII,"By her gait directly and her stoop,"
4781,XIII,"I, whom Jacynth was used to importune                             395"
4782,XIII,To let that same witch tell us our fortune.
4783,XIII,The oldest gypsy then above ground;
4784,XIII,"And, sure as the autumn season came round,"
4785,XIII,"She paid us a visit for profit or pastime,"
4786,XIII,"And every time, as she swore, for the last time.                  400"
4787,XIII,And presently she was seen to sidle
4788,XIII,"Up to the Duke till she touched his bridle,"
4789,XIII,So that the horse of a sudden reared up
4790,XIII,As under its nose the old witch peered up
4791,XIII,"With her worn-out eyes, or rather eye-holes                       405"
4792,XIII,"Of no use now but to gather brine,"
4793,XIII,And began a kind of level whine
4794,XIII,Such as they used to sing to their viols
4795,XIII,When their ditties they go grinding
4796,XIII,Up and down with nobody minding;                                  410
4797,XIII,"And then, as of old, at the end of the humming"
4798,XIII,Her usual presents were forthcoming
4799,XIII,--A dog-whistle blowing the fiercest of trebles
4800,XIII,"(Just a seashore stone holding a dozen fine pebbles),"
4801,XIII,Or a porcelain mouthpiece to screw on a pipe-end--                415
4802,XIII,And so she awaited her annual stipend.
4803,XIII,But this time the Duke would scarcely vouchsafe
4804,XIII,A word in reply; and in vain she felt
4805,XIII,With twitching fingers at her belt
4806,XIII,"For the purse of sleek pine-marten pelt,                        420"
4807,XIII,Ready to put what he gave in her pouch safe--
4808,XIII,"Till, either to quicken his apprehension,"
4809,XIII,"Or possibly with an after-intention,"
4810,XIII,"She was come, she said, to pay her duty"
4811,XIII,"To the new Duchess, the youthful beauty.                          425"
4812,XIII,No sooner had she named his lady
4813,XIII,"Than a shine lit up the face so shady,"
4814,XIII,And its smirk returned with a novel meaning--
4815,XIII,"For it struck him, the babe just wanted weaning;"
4816,XIII,"If one gave her a taste of what life was and sorrow,              430"
4817,XIII,"She, foolish today, would be wiser tomorrow;"
4818,XIII,And who so fit a teacher of trouble
4819,XIII,As this sordid crone bent well-nigh double?
4820,XIII,"So, glancing at her wolf-skin vesture,"
4821,XIII,"(If such it was, for they grow so hirsute                       435"
4822,XIII,That their own fleece serves for natural fur-suit)
4823,XIII,"He was contrasting, 'twas plain from his gesture,"
4824,XIII,The life of the lady so flower-like and delicate
4825,XIII,With the loathsome squalor of this helicat.
4826,XIII,"I, in brief, was the man the Duke beckoned                        440"
4827,XIII,"From out of the throng, and while I drew near"
4828,XIII,He told the crone--as I since have reckoned
4829,XIII,By the way he bent and spoke into her ear
4830,XIII,With circumspection and mystery--
4831,XIII,"The main of the lady's history,                                   445"
4832,XIII,Her frowardness and ingratitude:
4833,XIII,And for all the crone's submissive attitude
4834,XIII,"I could see round her mouth the loose plaits tightening,"
4835,XIII,"And her brow with assenting intelligence brightening,"
4836,XIII,As though she engaged with hearty goodwill                      450
4837,XIII,"Whatever he now might enjoin to fulfill,"
4838,XIII,And promised the lady a thorough frightening.
4839,XIII,"And so, just giving her a glimpse"
4840,XIII,"Of a purse, with the air of a man who imps"
4841,XIII,"The wing of the hawk that shall fetch the hernshaw,               455"
4842,XIII,He bade me take the gypsy mother
4843,XIII,And set her telling some story or other
4844,XIII,"Of hill or dale, oak-wood or fernshaw,"
4845,XIII,To wile away a weary hour
4846,XIII,"For the lady left alone in her bower,                             460"
4847,XIII,Whose mind and body craved exertion
4848,XIII,And yet shrank from all better diversion.
4849,XIII,
4850,XIII,
4851,XIV,XIV
4852,XIV,
4853,XIV,"Then clapping heel to his horse, the mere curveter,"
4854,XIV,"Out rode the Duke, and after his hollo"
4855,XIV,"Horses and hounds swept, huntsman and servitor,                   465"
4856,XIV,And back I turned and bade the crone follow.
4857,XIV,And what makes me confident what's to be told you
4858,XIV,"Had all along been of this crone's devising,"
4859,XIV,"Is, that, on looking round sharply, behold you,"
4860,XIV,There was a novelty quick as surprising:                        470
4861,XIV,"For first, she had shot up a full head in stature,"
4862,XIV,"And her step kept pace with mine nor faltered,"
4863,XIV,"As if age had foregone its usurpature,"
4864,XIV,"And the ignoble mien was wholly altered,"
4865,XIV,"And the face looked quite of another nature,                      475"
4866,XIV,"And the change reached too, whatever the change meant,"
4867,XIV,Her shaggy wolf-skin cloak's arrangement:
4868,XIV,"For where its tatters hung loose like sedges,"
4869,XIV,"Gold coins were glittering on the edges,"
4870,XIV,Like the band-roll strung with tomans                             480
4871,XIV,Which proves the veil a Persian woman's:
4872,XIV,"And under her brow, like a snail's horns newly"
4873,XIV,"Come out as after the rain he paces,"
4874,XIV,Two unmistakable eye-points duly
4875,XIV,Live and aware looked out of their places.                      485
4876,XIV,"So, we went and found Jacynth at the entry"
4877,XIV,Of the lady's chamber standing sentry;
4878,XIV,"I told the command and produced my companion,"
4879,XIV,"And Jacynth rejoiced to admit anyone,"
4880,XIV,"For since last night, by the same token,                          490"
4881,XIV,Not a single word had the lady spoken:
4882,XIV,"They went in both to the presence together,"
4883,XIV,While I in the balcony watched the weather.
4884,XIV,
4885,XIV,
4886,XV,XV
4887,XV,
4888,XV,"And now, what took place at the very first of all,"
4889,XV,"I cannot tell, as I never could learn it:                         495"
4890,XV,Jacynth constantly wished a curse to fall
4891,XV,"On that little head of hers and burn it,"
4892,XV,If she knew how she came to drop so soundly
4893,XV,Asleep of a sudden and there continue
4894,XV,The whole time sleeping as profoundly                             500
4895,XV,As one of the boars my father would pin you
4896,XV,"'Twixt the eyes where life holds garrison,"
4897,XV,--Jacynth forgive me the comparison!
4898,XV,But where I begin my own narration
4899,XV,Is a little after I took my station                               505
4900,XV,"To breathe the fresh air from the balcony,"
4901,XV,"And, having in those days a falcon eye,"
4902,XV,"To follow the hunt through the open country,"
4903,XV,From where the bushes thinlier crested
4904,XV,"The hillocks, to a plain where's not one tree.                    510"
4905,XV,"When, in a moment, my ear was arrested"
4906,XV,"By--was it singing, or was it saying,"
4907,XV,Or a strange musical instrument playing
4908,XV,In the chamber?--and to be certain
4909,XV,"I pushed the lattice, pulled the curtain,                         515"
4910,XV,"And there lay Jacynth asleep,"
4911,XV,"Yet as if a watch she tried to keep,"
4912,XV,In a rosy sleep along the floor
4913,XV,With her head against the door;
4914,XV,"While in the midst, on the seat of state,                         520"
4915,XV,"Was a queen--the gypsy woman late,"
4916,XV,With head and face downbent
4917,XV,On the lady's head and face intent:
4918,XV,"For, coiled at her feet like a child at ease,"
4919,XV,"The lady sat between her knees,                                   525"
4920,XV,"And o'er them the lady's clasped hands met,"
4921,XV,"And on those hands her chin was set,"
4922,XV,And her upturned face met the face of the crone
4923,XV,Wherein the eyes had grown and grown
4924,XV,As if she could double and quadruple                              530
4925,XV,At pleasure the play of either pupil
4926,XV,"--Very like, by her hands' slow fanning,"
4927,XV,As up and down like a gor-crow's flappers
4928,XV,"They moved to measure, or bell-clappers."
4929,XV,"I said, ""Is it blessing, is it banning,                         535"
4930,XV,Do they applaud you or burlesque you
4931,XV,"Those hands and fingers with no flesh on?"""
4932,XV,"But, just as I thought to spring in to the rescue,"
4933,XV,At once I was stopped by the lady's expression:
4934,XV,For it was life her eyes were drinking                            540
4935,XV,"From the crone's wide pair above unwinking,"
4936,XV,"--Life's pure fire received without shrinking,"
4937,XV,Into the heart and breast whose heaving
4938,XV,Told you no single drop they were leaving
4939,XV,"--Life, that filling her, passed redundant                        545"
4940,XV,"Into her very hair, back swerving"
4941,XV,"Over each shoulder, loose and abundant,"
4942,XV,As her head thrown back showed the white throat curving;
4943,XV,"And the very tresses shared in the pleasure,"
4944,XV,"Moving to the mystic measure,                                     550"
4945,XV,Bounding as the bosom bounded.
4946,XV,"I stopped short, more and more confounded,"
4947,XV,"As still her cheeks burned and eyes glistened,"
4948,XV,As she listened and she listened:
4949,XV,"When all at once a hand detained me,                              555"
4950,XV,"The selfsame contagion gained me,"
4951,XV,"And I kept time to the wondrous chime,"
4952,XV,"Making out words and prose and rhyme,"
4953,XV,Till it seemed that the music furled
4954,XV,"Its wings like a task fulfilled, and dropped                    560"
4955,XV,"From under the words it first had propped,"
4956,XV,And left them midway in the world:
4957,XV,"Word took word as hand takes hand,"
4958,XV,"I could hear at last, and understand,"
4959,XV,"And when I held the unbroken thread,                              565"
4960,XV,The gypsy said:
4961,XV,"""And so at last we find my tribe."
4962,XV,"And so I set thee in the midst,"
4963,XV,And to one and all of them describe
4964,XV,"What thou saidst and what thou didst,                           570"
4965,XV,"Our long and terrible journey through,"
4966,XV,And all thou art ready to say and do
4967,XV,In the trials that remain:
4968,XV,I trace them the vein and the other vein
4969,XV,"That meet on thy brow and part again,                             575"
4970,XV,Making our rapid mystic mark;
4971,XV,And I bid my people prove and probe
4972,XV,Each eye's profound and glorious globe
4973,XV,Till they detect the kindred spark
4974,XV,"In those depths so dear and dark,                                 580"
4975,XV,"Like the spots that snap and burst and flee,"
4976,XV,Circling over the midnight sea.
4977,XV,And on that round young cheek of thine
4978,XV,"I make them recognize the tinge,"
4979,XV,As when of the costly scarlet wine                                585
4980,XV,They drip so much as will impinge
4981,XV,And spread in a thinnest scale afloat
4982,XV,One thick gold drop from the olive's coat
4983,XV,Over a silver plate whose sheen
4984,XV,Still through the mixture shall be seen.                          590
4985,XV,"For so I prove thee, to one and all,"
4986,XV,"Fit, when my people ope their breast,"
4987,XV,"To see the sign, and hear the call,"
4988,XV,"And take the vow, and stand the test"
4989,XV,Which adds one more child to the rest--                         595
4990,XV,"When the breast is bare and the arms are wide,"
4991,XV,And the world is left outside.
4992,XV,"For there is probation to decree,"
4993,XV,And many and long must the trials be
4994,XV,"Thou shalt victoriously endure,                                   600"
4995,XV,If that brow is true and those eyes are sure;
4996,XV,Like a jewel-finder's fierce assay
4997,XV,Of the prize he dug from its mountain-tomb--
4998,XV,Let once the vindicating ray
4999,XV,"Leap out amid the anxious gloom,                                605"
5000,XV,And steel and fire have done their part
5001,XV,And the prize falls on its finder's heart;
5002,XV,"So, trial after trial past,"
5003,XV,Wilt thou fall at the very last
5004,XV,"Breathless, half in trance                                        610"
5005,XV,"With the thrill of the great deliverance,"
5006,XV,Into our arms forevermore;
5007,XV,"And thou shalt know, those arms once curled"
5008,XV,"About thee, what we knew before,"
5009,XV,How love is the only good in the world.                           615
5010,XV,"Henceforth be loved as heart can love,"
5011,XV,"Or brain devise, or hand approve!"
5012,XV,"Stand up, look below,"
5013,XV,It is our life at thy feet we throw
5014,XV,To step with into light and joy;                                  620
5015,XV,Not a power of life but we employ
5016,XV,To satisfy thy nature's want;
5017,XV,"Art thou the tree that props the plant,"
5018,XV,Or the climbing plant that seeks the tree--
5019,XV,"Canst thou help us, must we help thee?                            625"
5020,XV,"If any two creatures grew into one,"
5021,XV,They would do more than the world has done:
5022,XV,"Though each apart were never so weak,"
5023,XV,Ye vainly through the world should seek
5024,XV,For the knowledge and the might                                   630
5025,XV,Which in such union grew their right:
5026,XV,"So, to approach at least that end,"
5027,XV,"And blend--as much as may be, blend"
5028,XV,Thee with us or us with thee--
5029,XV,"As climbing plant or propping tree,                               635"
5030,XV,"Shall someone deck thee, over and down,"
5031,XV,"Up and about, with blossoms and leaves?"
5032,XV,"Fix his heart's fruit for thy garland-crown,"
5033,XV,"Cling with his soul as the gourd-vine cleaves,"
5034,XV,Die on thy boughs and disappear                                   640
5035,XV,While not a leaf of thine is sere?
5036,XV,"Or is the other fate in store,"
5037,XV,"And art thou fitted to adore,"
5038,XV,"To give thy wondrous self away,"
5039,XV,And take a stronger nature's sway?                                645
5040,XV,I foresee and could foretell
5041,XV,"Thy future portion, sure and well:"
5042,XV,"But those passionate eyes speak true, speak true,"
5043,XV,Let them say what thou shalt do!
5044,XV,"Only be sure thy daily life,                                      650"
5045,XV,"In its peace or in its strife,"
5046,XV,Never shall be unobserved;
5047,XV,"We pursue thy whole career,"
5048,XV,"And hope for it, or doubt, or fear--"
5049,XV,"Lo, hast thou kept thy path or swerved,                           655"
5050,XV,"We are beside thee in all thy ways,"
5051,XV,"With our blame, with our praise,"
5052,XV,"Our shame to feel, our pride to show,"
5053,XV,"Glad, angry--but indifferent, no!"
5054,XV,"Whether it be thy lot to go,                                      660"
5055,XV,"For the good of us all, where the haters meet"
5056,XV,In the crowded city's horrible street;
5057,XV,Or thou step alone through the morass
5058,XV,Where never sound yet was
5059,XV,"Save the dry quick clap of the stork's bill,                      665"
5060,XV,"For the air is still, and the water still,"
5061,XV,When the blue breast of the dipping coot
5062,XV,"Dives under, and all is mute."
5063,XV,"So, at the last shall come old age,"
5064,XV,Decrepit as befits that stage;                                    670
5065,XV,How else wouldst thou retire apart
5066,XV,"With the hoarded memories of thy heart,"
5067,XV,And gather all to the very least
5068,XV,"Of the fragments of life's earlier feast,"
5069,XV,Let fall through eagerness to find                                675
5070,XV,The crowning dainties yet behind?
5071,XV,Ponder on the entire past
5072,XV,"Laid together thus at last,"
5073,XV,When the twilight helps to fuse
5074,XV,"The first fresh with the faded hues,                              680"
5075,XV,"And the outline of the whole,"
5076,XV,"As round eve's shades their framework roll,"
5077,XV,Grandly fronts for once thy soul.
5078,XV,"And then as, 'mid the dark, a gleam"
5079,XV,"Of yet another morning breaks,                                  685"
5080,XV,"And like the hand which ends a dream,"
5081,XV,"Death, with the might of his sunbeam,"
5082,XV,"Touches the flesh and the soul awakes,"
5083,XV,"Then""----"
5084,XV,"Aye, then indeed something would happen!"
5085,XV,But what? For here her voice changed like a bird's;             690
5086,XV,There grew more of the music and less of the words;
5087,XV,Had Jacynth only been by me to clap pen
5088,XV,To paper and put you down every syllable
5089,XV,"With those clever clerkly fingers,"
5090,XV,All I've forgotten as well as what lingers                      695
5091,XV,In this old brain of mine that's but ill able
5092,XV,To give you even this poor version
5093,XV,"Of the speech I spoil, as it were, with stammering"
5094,XV,--More fault of those who had the hammering
5095,XV,"Of prosody into me and syntax,                                  700"
5096,XV,"And did it, not with hobnails but tin-tacks!"
5097,XV,But to return from this excursion--
5098,XV,"Just, do you mark, when the song was sweetest,"
5099,XV,"The peace most deep and the charm completest,"
5100,XV,"There came, shall I say, a snap--                                 705"
5101,XV,And the charm vanished!
5102,XV,"And my sense returned, so strangely banished,"
5103,XV,"And, starting as from a nap,"
5104,XV,"I knew the crone was bewitching my lady,"
5105,XV,With Jacynth asleep; and but one spring made I                    710
5106,XV,"Down from the casement, round to the portal,"
5107,XV,Another minute and I had entered--
5108,XV,"When the door opened, and more than mortal"
5109,XV,"Stood, with a face where to my mind centered"
5110,XV,"All beauties I ever saw or shall see,                             715"
5111,XV,The Duchess: I stopped as if struck by palsy.
5112,XV,"She was so different, happy and beautiful,"
5113,XV,"I felt at once that all was best,"
5114,XV,"And that I had nothing to do, for the rest,"
5115,XV,"But wait her commands, obey and be dutiful.                       720"
5116,XV,"Not that, in fact, there was any commanding;"
5117,XV,"I saw the glory of her eye,"
5118,XV,"And the brow's height and the breast's expanding,"
5119,XV,And I was hers to live or to die.
5120,XV,"As for finding what she wanted,                                   725"
5121,XV,You know God Almighty granted
5122,XV,Such little signs should serve wild creatures
5123,XV,"To tell one another all their desires,"
5124,XV,"So that each knows what his friend requires,"
5125,XV,And does its bidding without teachers.                            730
5126,XV,I preceded her: the crone
5127,XV,Followed silent and alone;
5128,XV,"I spoke to her, but she merely jabbered"
5129,XV,In the old style; both her eyes had slunk
5130,XV,Back to their pits; her stature shrunk;                         735
5131,XV,"In short, the soul in its body sunk"
5132,XV,Like a blade sent home to its scabbard.
5133,XV,"We descended, I preceding;"
5134,XV,Crossed the court with nobody heeding;
5135,XV,"All the world was at the chase,                                   740"
5136,XV,"The courtyard like a desert-place,"
5137,XV,The stable emptied of its small fry;
5138,XV,I saddled myself the very palfrey
5139,XV,"I remember patting while it carried her,"
5140,XV,The day she arrived and the Duke married her.                     745
5141,XV,"And, do you know, though it's easy deceiving"
5142,XV,"Oneself in such matters, I can't help believing"
5143,XV,"The lady had not forgotten it either,"
5144,XV,And knew the poor devil so much beneath her
5145,XV,Would have been only too glad for her service                     750
5146,XV,"To dance on hot plowshares like a Turk dervise,"
5147,XV,"But, unable to pay proper duty where owing it,"
5148,XV,Was reduced to that pitiful method of showing it:
5149,XV,For though the moment I began setting
5150,XV,"His saddle on my own nag of Berold's begetting,                   755"
5151,XV,(Not that I meant to be obtrusive)
5152,XV,"She stopped me, while his rug was shifting,"
5153,XV,"By a single rapid finger's lifting,"
5154,XV,"And, with a gesture kind but conclusive,"
5155,XV,"And a little shake of the head, refused me--                      760"
5156,XV,"I say, although she never used me,"
5157,XV,"Yet when she was mounted, the gypsy behind her,"
5158,XV,"And I ventured to remind her,"
5159,XV,I suppose with a voice of less steadiness
5160,XV,"Than usual, for my feeling exceeded me,                         765"
5161,XV,--Something to the effect that I was in readiness
5162,XV,Whenever God should please she needed me--
5163,XV,"Then, do you know, her face looked down on me"
5164,XV,"With a look that placed a crown on me,"
5165,XV,"And she felt in her bosom--mark, her bosom--                      770"
5166,XV,"And, as a flower-tree drops its blossom,"
5167,XV,"Dropped me ... ah, had it been a purse"
5168,XV,"Of silver, my friend, or gold that's worse,"
5169,XV,"Why, you see, as soon as I found myself"
5170,XV,So understood--that a true heart so may gain                    775
5171,XV,"Such a reward--I should have gone home again,"
5172,XV,"Kissed Jacynth, and soberly drowned myself!"
5173,XV,It was a little plait of hair
5174,XV,Such as friends in a convent make
5175,XV,"To wear, each for the other's sake--                            780"
5176,XV,"This, see, which at my breast I wear,"
5177,XV,"Ever did (rather to Jacynth's grudgment),"
5178,XV,"And ever shall, till the Day of Judgment."
5179,XV,"And then--and then--to cut short--this is idle,"
5180,XV,These are feelings it is not good to foster--                   785
5181,XV,"I pushed the gate wide, she shook the bridle,"
5182,XV,And the palfrey bounded--and so we lost her.
5183,XV,
5184,XV,
5185,XVI,XVI
5186,XVI,
5187,XVI,When the liquor's out why clink the cannikin?
5188,XVI,I did think to describe you the panic in
5189,XVI,"The redoubtable breast of our master the mannikin,                790"
5190,XVI,"And what was the pitch of his mother's yellowness,"
5191,XVI,How she turned as a shark to snap the spare-rib
5192,XVI,"Clean off, sailors says, from a pearl-diving Carib,"
5193,XVI,"When she heard, what she called the flight of the feloness"
5194,XVI,"--But it seems such child's play,                                 795"
5195,XVI,What they said and did with the lady away!
5196,XVI,"And to dance on, when we've lost the music,"
5197,XVI,Always made me--and no doubt makes you--sick.
5198,XVI,"Nay, to my mind, the world's face looked so stern"
5199,XVI,"As that sweet form disappeared through the postern,               800"
5200,XVI,"She that kept it in constant good humor,"
5201,XVI,It ought to have stopped; there seemed nothing to do more.
5202,XVI,"But the world thought otherwise and went on,"
5203,XVI,And my head's one that its spite was spent on;
5204,XVI,"Thirty years are fled since that morning,                         805"
5205,XVI,And with them all my head's adorning.
5206,XVI,"Nor did the old Duchess die outright,"
5207,XVI,"As you expect, of suppressed spite,"
5208,XVI,The natural end of every adder
5209,XVI,Not suffered to empty its poison-bladder;                         810
5210,XVI,"But she and her son agreed, I take it,"
5211,XVI,"That no one should touch on the story to wake it,"
5212,XVI,"For the wound in the Duke's pride rankled fiery,"
5213,XVI,"So, they made no search and small inquiry--"
5214,XVI,"And when fresh gypsies have paid us a visit, I've                 815"
5215,XVI,"Noticed the couple were never inquisitive,"
5216,XVI,"But told them they're folks the Duke don't want here,"
5217,XVI,And bade them make haste and cross the frontier.
5218,XVI,"Brief, the Duchess was gone and the Duke was glad of it,"
5219,XVI,"And the old one was in the young one's stead,                   820"
5220,XVI,"And took, in her place, the household's head,"
5221,XVI,And a blessed time the household had of it!
5222,XVI,"And were I not, as a man may say, cautious"
5223,XVI,"How I trench, more than needs, on the nauseous,"
5224,XVI,I could favor you with sundry touches                             825
5225,XVI,Of the paint-smutches with which the Duchess
5226,XVI,Heightened the mellowness of her cheek's yellowness
5227,XVI,(To get on faster) until at last her
5228,XVI,Cheek grew to be one master-plaster
5229,XVI,Of mucus and fucus from mere use of ceruse:                       830

5231,XVI,Just the object to make you shudder.

5235,XVII,
5236,XVII,You're my friend--
5237,XVII,"What a thing friendship is, world without end!"
5238,XVII,How it gives the heart and soul a stir-up                         835
5239,XVII,"As if somebody broached you a glorious runlet,"
5240,XVII,"And poured out, all lovelily, sparklingly, sunlit,"
5241,XVII,"Our green Moldavia, the streaky syrup,"
5242,XVII,Cotnar as old as the time of the Druids--
5243,XVII,Friendship may match with that monarch of fluids;                 840
5244,XVII,"Each supples a dry brain, fills you its ins-and-outs,"
5245,XVII,Gives your life's hourglass a shake when the thin sand doubts
5246,XVII,"Whether to run on or stop short, and guarantees"
5247,XVII,Age is not all made of stark sloth and arrant ease.
5248,XVII,"I have seen my little lady once more,                             845"
5249,XVII,"Jacynth, the gypsy, Berold, and the rest of it,"
5250,XVII,"For to me spoke the Duke, as I told you before;"
5251,XVII,I always wanted to make a clean breast of it:
5252,XVII,"And now it is made--why, my heart's blood, that went trickle,"
5253,XVII,"Trickle, but anon, in such muddy driblets,                      850"
5254,XVII,"Is pumped up brisk now, through the main ventricle."
5255,XVII,And genially floats me about the giblets.
5256,XVII,I'll tell you what I intend to do:
5257,XVII,I must see this fellow his sad life through--
5258,XVII,"He is our Duke, after all,                                        855"
5259,XVII,"And I, as he says, but a serf and thrall."
5260,XVII,"My father was born here, and I inherit"
5261,XVII,"His fame, a chain he bound his son with;"
5262,XVII,"Could I pay in a lump I should prefer it,"
5263,XVII,But there's no mine to blow up and get done with:               860
5264,XVII,"So, I must stay till the end of the chapter."
5265,XVII,"For, as to our middle-age-manners-adapter,"
5266,XVII,"Be it a thing to be glad on or sorry on,"
5267,XVII,"Some day or other, his head in a morion"
5268,XVII,"And breast in a hauberk, his heels he'll kick up,                 865"
5269,XVII,Slain by an onslaught fierce of hiccup.
5270,XVII,"And then, when red doth the sword of our Duke rust,"
5271,XVII,"And its leathern sheath lie o'ergrown with a blue crust,"
5272,XVII,Then I shall scrape together my earnings;
5273,XVII,"For, you see, in the churchyard Jacynth reposes,                870"
5274,XVII,And our children all went the way of the roses.
5275,XVII,It's a long lane that knows no turnings.
5276,XVII,One needs but little tackle to travel in;
5277,XVII,"So, just one stout cloak shall I indue:"
5278,XVII,"And for a staff, what beats the javelin                           875"
5279,XVII,With which his boars my father pinned you?
5280,XVII,"And then, for a purpose you shall hear presently,"
5281,XVII,"Taking some Cotnar, a tight plump skinful,"
5282,XVII,"I shall go journeying, who but I, pleasantly!"
5283,XVII,Sorrow is vain and despondency sinful.                          880
5284,XVII,"What's a man's age? He must hurry more, that's all;"
5285,XVII,Cram in a day what his youth took a year to hold:
5286,XVII,"When we mind labor, then only, we're too old--"
5287,XVII,What age had Methusalem when he begat Saul?
5288,XVII,"And at last, as its haven some buffeted ship sees,                885"
5289,XVII,(Come all the way from the north-parts with sperm oil)
5290,XVII,I hope to get safely out of the turmoil
5291,XVII,"And arrive one day at the land of the gypsies,"
5292,XVII,"And find my lady, or hear the last news of her"
5293,XVII,"From some old thief and son of Lucifer,                           890"
5294,XVII,"His forehead chapleted green with wreathy hop,"
5295,XVII,Sunburned all over like an Æthiop.
5296,XVII,And when my Cotnar begins to operate
5297,XVII,"And the tongue of the rogue to run at a proper rate,"
5298,XVII,"And our wine-skin, tight once, shows each flaccid dent,           895"
5299,XVII,I shall drop in with--as if by accident--
5300,XVII,"""You never knew, then, how it all ended,"
5301,XVII,What fortune good or bad attended
5302,XVII,"The little lady your Queen befriended?"""
5303,XVII,"--And when that's told me, what's remaining?                      900"
5304,XVII,This world's too hard for my explaining.
5305,XVII,The same wise judge of matters equine
5306,XVII,Who still preferred some slim four-year-old
5307,XVII,"To the big-boned stock of mighty Berold,"
5308,XVII,"And, for strong Cotnar, drank French weak wine,                   905"
5309,XVII,He also must be such a lady's scorner!
5310,XVII,Smooth Jacob still robs homely Esau:
5311,XVII,"Now up, now down, the world's one see-saw."
5312,XVII,"--So, I shall find out some snug corner"
5313,XVII,"Under a hedge, like Orson the wood-knight,                        910"
5314,XVII,Turn myself round and bid the world good night;
5315,XVII,And sleep a sound sleep till the trumpet's blowing
5316,XVII,Wakes me (unless priests cheat us laymen)
5317,XVII,To a world where will be no further throwing
5318,XVII,Pearls before swine that can't value them. Amen!                915

5738,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"The cloak, that somewhat shone and showed the threads,"
5739,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Had purpose, and the ruff, significance."
5740,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"He walked and tapped the pavement with his cane,                   10"
5741,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Scenting the world, looking it full in face,"
5742,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"An old dog, bald and blindish, at his heels."
5743,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"They turned up, now, the alley by the church,"
5744,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"That leads nowhither; now, they breathed themselves"
5745,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,On the main promenade just at the wrong time;                      15
5746,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"You'd come upon his scrutinizing hat,"
5747,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Making a peaked shade blacker than itself
5748,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Against the single window spared some house
5749,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Intact yet with its moldered Moorish work--
5750,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Or else surprise the ferrel of his stick                           20
5751,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Trying the mortar's temper 'tween the chinks
5752,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Of some new shop a-building, French and fine."
5753,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"He stood and watched the cobbler at his trade,"
5754,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"The man who slices lemons into drink,"
5755,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"The coffee-roaster's brazier, and the boys                         25"
5756,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,That volunteer to help him turn its winch.
5757,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"He glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye,"
5758,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"And fly-leaf ballads on the vender's string,"
5759,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,And broad-edge bold-print posters by the wall.
5760,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"He took such cognizance of men and things,                         30"
5761,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"If any beat a horse, you felt he saw;"
5762,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"If any cursed a woman, he took note;"
5763,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Yet stared at nobody--you stared at him,"
5764,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"And found, less to your pleasure than surprise,"
5765,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,He seemed to know you and expect as much.                          35
5766,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"So, next time that a neighbor's tongue was loosed,"
5767,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"It marked the shameful and notorious fact,"
5768,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"We had among us, not so much a spy,"
5769,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"As a recording chief-inquisitor,"
5770,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,The town's true master if the town but knew!                       40
5771,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"We merely kept a governor for form,"
5772,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,While this man walked about and took account
5773,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Of all thought, said and acted, then went home,"
5774,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,And wrote it fully to our Lord the King
5775,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Who has an itch to know things, he knows why,                      45"
5776,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,And reads them in his bedroom of a night.
5777,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Oh, you might smile! there wanted not a touch,"
5778,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"A tang of ... well, it was not wholly ease"
5779,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,As back into your mind the man's look came.
5780,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Stricken in years a little--such a brow                            50
5781,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,His eyes had to live under!--clear as flint
5782,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,On either side the formidable nose
5783,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Curved, cut and colored like an eagle's claw."
5784,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Had he to do with A's surprising fate?
5785,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,When altogether old B disappeared                                  55
5786,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"And young C got his mistress--was't our friend,"
5787,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"His letter to the King, that did it all?"
5788,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,What paid the bloodless man for so much pains?
5789,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Our Lord the King has favorites manifold,"
5790,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,And shifts his ministry some once a month;                         60
5791,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Our city gets new governors at whiles--
5792,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"But never word or sign, that I could hear,"
5793,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Notified to this man about the streets
5794,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,The King's approval of those letters conned
5795,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,The last thing duly at the dead of night.                          65
5796,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Did the man love his office? Frowned our Lord,"
5797,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Exhorting when none heard--""Beseech me not!"
5798,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Too far above my people--beneath me!
5799,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,I set the watch--how should the people know?
5800,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Forget them, keep me all the more in mind!""                        70"
5801,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Was some such understanding 'twixt the two?
5802,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,
5803,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,I found no truth in one report at least--
5804,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"That if you tracked him to his home, down lanes"
5805,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Beyond the Jewry, and as clean to pace,"
5806,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,You found he ate his supper in a room                              75
5807,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Blazing with lights, four Titians on the walls,"
5808,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,And twenty naked girls to change his plate!
5809,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Poor man, he lived another kind of life"
5810,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"In that new stuccoed third house by the bridge,"
5811,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Fresh-painted, rather smart than otherwise!                        80"
5812,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"The whole street might o'erlook him as he sat,"
5813,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Leg crossing leg, one foot on the dog's back,"
5814,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Playing a decent cribbage with his maid
5815,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"(Jacynth, you're sure her name was) o'er the cheese"
5816,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"And fruit, three red halves of starved winter-pears,               85"
5817,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Or treat of radishes in April. Nine,"
5818,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Ten, struck the church clock, straight to bed went he."
5819,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,
5820,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"My father, like the man of sense he was,"
5821,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Would point him out to me a dozen times;
5822,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"""'St--'St,"" he'd whisper, ""the Corregidor!""                        90"
5823,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,I had been used to think that personage
5824,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Was one with lacquered breeches, lustrous belt,"
5825,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"And feathers like a forest in his hat,"
5826,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Who blew a trumpet and proclaimed the news,"
5827,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Announced the bull-fights, gave each church its turn,              95"
5828,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,And memorized the miracle in vogue!
5829,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,He had a great observance from us boys;
5830,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,We were in error; that was not the man.
5831,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,
5832,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"I'd like now, yet had haply been afraid,"
5833,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"To have just looked, when this man came to die,                   100"
5834,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,And seen who lined the clean gay garret-sides
5835,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"And stood about the neat low truckle-bed,"
5836,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,With the heavenly manner of relieving guard.
5837,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Here had been, mark, the general-in-chief,"
5838,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Through a whole campaign of the world's life and death,           105"
5839,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Doing the King's work all the dim day long,"
5840,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"In his old coat and up to knees in mud,"
5841,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Smoked like a herring, dining on a crust--"
5842,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"And, now the day was won, relieved at once!"
5843,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"No further show or need for that old coat,                        110"
5844,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"You are sure, for one thing! Bless us, all the while"
5845,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"How sprucely we are dressed out, you and I!"
5846,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"A second, and the angels alter that."
5847,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,"Well, I could never write a verse--could you?"
5848,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,Let's to the Prado and make the most of time.                     115

5854,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
5855,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
5856,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I am poor brother Lippo, by your leave!"
5857,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You need not clap your torches to my face.
5858,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Zooks, what's to blame? you think you see a monk!"
5859,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"What, 'tis past midnight, and you go the rounds,"
5860,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And here you catch me at an alley's end                             5
5861,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Where sportive ladies leave their doors ajar?
5862,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The Carmine's my cloister: hunt it up,"
5863,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Do--harry out, if you must show your zeal,"
5864,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Whatever rat, there, haps on his wrong hole,"
5865,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And nip each softling of a wee white mouse,                        10"
5866,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_Weke, weke_, that's crept to keep him company!"
5867,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Aha, you know your betters! Then, you'll take"
5868,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Your hand away that's fiddling on my throat,"
5869,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And please to know me likewise. Who am I?
5870,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Why, one, sir, who is lodging with a friend                        15"
5871,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Three streets off--he's a certain ... how d'ye call?
5872,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Master--a ... Cosimo of the Medici,"
5873,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I' the house that caps the corner. Boh! you were best!
5874,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Remember and tell me, the day you're hanged,"
5875,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,How you affected such a gullet's-gripe!                            20
5876,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"But you, sir, it concerns you that your knaves"
5877,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Pick up a manner nor discredit you:
5878,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Zooks, are we pilchards, that they sweep the streets"
5879,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And count fair prize what comes into their net?
5880,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"He's Judas to a tittle, that man is!                               25"
5881,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Just such a face! Why, sir, you make amends."
5882,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lord, I'm not angry! Bid your hangdogs go"
5883,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Drink out this quarter-florin to the health
5884,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Of the munificent House that harbors me
5885,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"(And many more beside, lads! more beside!)                         30"
5886,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And all's come square again. I'd like his face--
5887,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"His, elbowing on his comrade in the door"
5888,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,With the pike and lantern--for the slave that holds
5889,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,John Baptist's head a-dangle by the hair
5890,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"With one hand (""Look you, now,"" as who should say)                 35"
5891,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And his weapon in the other, yet unwiped!"
5892,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"It's not your chance to have a bit of chalk,"
5893,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A wood-coal, or the like? or you should see!"
5894,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Yes, I'm the painter, since you style me so."
5895,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"What, brother Lippo's doings, up and down,                         40"
5896,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You know them and they take you? like enough!
5897,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I saw the proper twinkle in your eye--
5898,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"'Tell you, I liked your looks at very first."
5899,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Let's sit and set things straight now, hip to haunch."
5900,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Here's spring come, and the nights one makes up bands              45"
5901,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To roam the town and sing out carnival,"
5902,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And I've been three weeks shut within my mew,"
5903,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A-painting for the great man, saints and saints"
5904,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And saints again. I could not paint all night--
5905,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Ouf! I leaned out of window for fresh air.                         50
5906,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"There came a hurry of feet and little feet,"
5907,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A sweep of lute-strings, laughs, and whifts of song--"
5908,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_Flower o' the broom,_"
5909,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_Take away love, and our earth is a tomb!_"
5910,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_Flower o' the quince,_                                            55"
5911,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_I let Lisa go, and what good in life since?_"
5912,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,_Flower o' the thyme_--and so on. Round they went.
5913,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Scarce had they turned the corner when a titter
5914,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight--three slim shapes,"
5915,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And a face that looked up ... zooks, sir, flesh and blood,         60"
5916,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"That's all I'm made of! Into shreds it went,"
5917,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Curtain and counterpane and coverlet,"
5918,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"All the bed-furniture--a dozen knots,"
5919,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"There was a ladder! Down I let myself,"
5920,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Hands and feet, scrambling somehow, and so dropped,                65"
5921,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And after them. I came up with the fun
5922,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Hard by Saint Laurence, hail fellow, well met--"
5923,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_Flower o' the rose,_"
5924,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_If I've been merry, what matter who knows?_"
5925,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And so I was stealing back again                                   70
5926,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,To get to bed and have a bit of sleep
5927,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Ere I rise up tomorrow and go work
5928,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,On Jerome knocking at his poor old breast
5929,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"With his great round stone to subdue the flesh,"
5930,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You snap me of the sudden. Ah, I see!                              75"
5931,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Though your eye twinkles still, you shake your head--"
5932,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Mine's shaved--a monk, you say--the sting's in that!"
5933,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"If Master Cosimo announced himself,"
5934,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Mum's the word naturally; but a monk!
5935,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Come, what am I a beast for? tell us, now!                         80"
5936,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I was a baby when my mother died
5937,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And father died and left me in the street.
5938,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I starved there, God knows how, a year or two"
5939,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and shucks,"
5940,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Refuse and rubbish. One fine frosty day,                           85"
5941,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"My stomach being empty as your hat,"
5942,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The wind doubled me up and down I went.
5943,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Old Aunt Lapaccia trussed me with one hand
5944,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"(Its fellow was a stinger as I knew),"
5945,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And so along the wall, over the bridge,                            90"
5946,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"By the straight cut to the convent. Six words there,"
5947,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,While I stood munching my first bread that month:
5948,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""So, boy, you've minded,"" quoth the good fat father,"
5949,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Wiping his own mouth--'twas refection-time--
5950,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""To quit this very miserable world?                                95"
5951,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Will you renounce"" ... ""the mouthful of bread?"" thought I;"
5952,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"By no means! Brief, they made a monk of me;"
5953,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I did renounce the world, its pride and greed,"
5954,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Palace, farm, villa, shop, and banking-house,"
5955,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Trash, such as these poor devils of Medici                        100"
5956,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Have given their hearts to--all at eight years old.
5957,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Well, sir, I found in time, you may be sure,"
5958,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"'Twas not for nothing--the good bellyful,"
5959,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The warm serge and the rope that goes all round,"
5960,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And day-long blessed idleness beside!                             105
5961,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Let's see what the urchin's fit for""--that came next."
5962,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Not overmuch their way, I must confess."
5963,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Such a to-do! They tried me with their books;
5964,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lord, they'd have taught me Latin in pure waste!"
5965,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_Flower o' the clove,_                                            110"
5966,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_All the Latin I construe is ""amo,"" I love!_"
5967,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"But, mind you, when a boy starves in the streets"
5968,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Eight years together, as my fortune was,"
5969,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Watching folk's faces to know who will fling
5970,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires,                  115"
5971,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And who will curse or kick him for his pains--
5972,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Which gentleman processional and fine,"
5973,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Holding a candle to the Sacrament,"
5974,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch
5975,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The droppings of the wax to sell again,                           120"
5976,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Or holla for the Eight and have him whipped--
5977,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"How say I?--nay, which dog bites, which lets drop"
5978,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,His bone from the heap of offal in the street--
5979,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp alike,"
5980,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"He learns the look of things, and none the less                   125"
5981,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,For admonition from the hunger-pinch.
5982,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I had a store of such remarks, be sure,"
5983,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Which, after I found leisure, turned to use."
5984,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I drew men's faces on my copy books,"
5985,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Scrawled them within the antiphonary's marge,                     130"
5986,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes,"
5987,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and B's,"
5988,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And made a string of pictures of the world
5989,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun,"
5990,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"On the wall, the bench, the door. The monks looked black.         135"
5991,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Nay,"" quoth the Prior, ""turn him out, d'ye say?"
5992,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,In no wise. Lose a crow and catch a lark.
5993,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"What if at last we get our man of parts,"
5994,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"We Carmelites, like those Camaldolese"
5995,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And Preaching Friars, to do our church up fine                    140"
5996,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And put the front on it that ought to be!"""
5997,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And hereupon he bade me daub away.
5998,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank,"
5999,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Never was such prompt disemburdening.
6000,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"First, every sort of monk, the black and white,                   145"
6001,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at church,"
6002,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,From good old gossips waiting to confess
6003,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Their cribs of barrel-droppings, candle-ends--"
6004,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot,"
6005,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there                     150"
6006,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,With the little children round him in a row
6007,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Of admiration, half for his beard and half"
6008,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,For that white anger of his victim's son
6009,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm,"
6010,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Signing himself with the other because of Christ                  155
6011,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,(Whose sad face on the cross sees only this
6012,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,After the passion of a thousand years)
6013,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head,"
6014,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,(Which the intense eyes looked through) came at eve
6015,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf,                        160"
6016,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers
6017,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"(The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone."
6018,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I painted all, then cried, ""'Tis ask and have;"
6019,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Choose, for more's ready!""--laid the ladder flat,"
6020,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall.                       165
6021,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The monks closed in a circle and praised loud
6022,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Till checked, taught what to see and not to see,"
6023,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Being simple bodies--""That's the very man!"
6024,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog!
6025,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,That woman's like the Prior's niece who comes                     170
6026,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To care about his asthma: it's the life!"""
6027,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funked;
6028,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Their betters took their turn to see and say:
6029,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The Prior and the learned pulled a face
6030,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And stopped all that in no time. ""How? what's here?               175"
6031,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all!"
6032,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true"
6033,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,As much as pea and pea! It's devil's-game!
6034,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Your business is not to catch men with show,"
6035,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"With homage to the perishable clay,                               180"
6036,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"But lift them over it, ignore it all,"
6037,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh.
6038,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Your business is to paint the souls of men---
6039,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke ... no, it's not ..."
6040,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,It's vapor done up like a new-born babe--                         185
6041,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,(In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth)
6042,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"It's ... well, what matters talking, it's the soul!"
6043,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Give us no more of body than shows soul!
6044,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Here's Giotto, with his Saint a-praising God,"
6045,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,That sets us praising--why not stop with him?                     190
6046,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head
6047,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"With wonder at lines, colors, and what not?"
6048,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Paint the soul; never mind the legs and arms!
6049,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Rub all out; try at it a second time.
6050,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts,                  195"
6051,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"She's just my niece ... Herodias, I would say--"
6052,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off!
6053,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Have it all out!"" Now, is this sense, I ask?"
6054,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A fine way to paint soul, by painting body"
6055,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"So ill the eye can't stop there, must go further,                 200"
6056,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for white"
6057,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"When what you put for yellow's simply black,"
6058,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And any sort of meaning looks intense
6059,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,When all beside itself means and looks naught.
6060,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn,                       205"
6061,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Left foot and right foot, go a double step,"
6062,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Make his flesh liker and his soul more like,"
6063,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Both in their order? Take the prettiest face,"
6064,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The Prior's niece ... patron-saint--is it so pretty
6065,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You can't discover if it means hope, fear,                        210"
6066,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Sorrow, or joy? Won't beauty go with these?"
6067,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue,"
6068,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash,"
6069,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And then add soul and heighten them three-fold?
6070,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Or say there's beauty with no soul at all--                       215
6071,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,(I never saw it--put the case the same--)
6072,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"If you get simple beauty and naught else,"
6073,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You get about the best thing God invents:
6074,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed,"
6075,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Within yourself, when you return Him thanks.                      220"
6076,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Rub all out!"" Well, well, there's my life, in short,"
6077,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And so the thing has gone on ever since.
6078,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I'm grown a man no doubt; I've broken bounds:
6079,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You should not take a fellow eight years old
6080,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And make him swear to never kiss the girls.                       225
6081,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I'm my own master, paint now as I please--"
6082,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house!"
6083,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front--"
6084,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Those great rings serve more purposes than just
6085,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse!                            230"
6086,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes"
6087,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work,"
6088,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The heads shake still--""It's art's decline, my son!"
6089,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You're not of the true painters, great and old;"
6090,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Brother Angelico's the man, you'll find;                          235"
6091,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Brother Lorenzo stands his single peer:
6092,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Fag on at flesh, you'll never make the third!"""
6093,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_Flower o' the pine,_"
6094,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_You keep your mist ... manners, and I'll stick to mine!_"
6095,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I'm not the third, then: bless us, they must know!                240"
6096,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Don't you think they're the likeliest to know,"
6097,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"They with their Latin? So, I swallow my rage,"
6098,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Clench my teeth, suck my lips in tight, and paint"
6099,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,To please them--sometimes do and sometimes don't;
6100,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"For, doing most, there's pretty sure to come                      245"
6101,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A turn, some warm eve finds me at my saints--"
6102,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A laugh, a cry, the business of the world--"
6103,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_(Flower o' the peach,_"
6104,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_Death for us all, and his own life for each!)_"
6105,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And my whole soul revolves, the cup runs over,                    250"
6106,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The world and life's too big to pass for a dream,"
6107,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And I do these wild things in sheer despite,"
6108,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And play the fooleries you catch me at,"
6109,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"In pure rage! The old mill-horse, out at grass"
6110,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"After hard years, throws up his stiff heels so,                   255"
6111,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Although the miller does not preach to him
6112,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The only good of grass is to make chaff.
6113,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,What would men have? Do they like grass or no--
6114,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,May they or mayn't they? All I want's the thing
6115,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Settled forever one way. As it is,                                260"
6116,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You tell too many lies and hurt yourself:
6117,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You don't like what you only like too much,"
6118,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You do like what, if given you at your word,"
6119,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,You find abundantly detestable.
6120,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"For me, I think I speak as I was taught;                          265"
6121,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I always see the garden and God there
6122,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A-making man's wife: and, my lesson learned,"
6123,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The value and significance of flesh,"
6124,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I can't unlearn ten minutes afterwards.
6125,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
6126,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You understand me: I'm a beast, I know.                           270"
6127,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"But see, now--why, I see as certainly"
6128,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"As that the morning-star's about to shine,"
6129,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,What will hap some day. We've a youngster here
6130,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Comes to our convent, studies what I do,"
6131,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Slouches and stares and lets no atom drop:                        275
6132,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,His name is Guidi--he'll not mind the monks--
6133,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"They call him Hulking Tom, he lets them talk--"
6134,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,He picks my practice up--he'll paint apace.
6135,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I hope so--though I never live so long,"
6136,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I know what's sure to follow. You be judge!                       280
6137,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"You speak no Latin more than I, belike;"
6138,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"However, you're my man, you've seen the world"
6139,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"--The beauty and the wonder and the power,"
6140,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The shapes of things, their colors, lights, and shades"
6141,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Changes, surprises--and God made it all!                          285"
6142,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"--For what? Do you feel thankful, aye or no,"
6143,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"For this fair town's face, yonder river's line,"
6144,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The mountain round it and the sky above,"
6145,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Much more the figures of man, woman, child,"
6146,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,These are the frame to? What's it all about?                      290
6147,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To be passed over, despised? or dwelt upon,"
6148,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Wondered at? oh, this last of course!--you say."
6149,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,But why not do as well as say--paint these
6150,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Just as they are, careless what comes of it?"
6151,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"God's works--paint any one, and count it crime                    295"
6152,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To let a truth slip. Don't object, ""His works"
6153,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Are here already; nature is complete:
6154,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Suppose you reproduce her--(which you can't)
6155,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"There's no advantage! you must beat her, then."""
6156,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"For, don't you mark? we're made so that we love                   300"
6157,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"First when we see them painted, things we have passed"
6158,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;
6159,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And so they are better, painted--better to us,"
6160,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Which is the same thing. Art was given for that;
6161,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"God uses us to help each other so,                                305"
6162,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lending our minds out. Have you noticed, now,"
6163,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Your cullion's hanging face? A bit of chalk,"
6164,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And trust me but you should, though! How much more,"
6165,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,If I drew higher things with the same truth!
6166,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"That were to take the Prior's pulpit-place,                       310"
6167,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Interpret God to all of you! Oh, oh,"
6168,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,It makes me mad to see what men shall do
6169,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And we in our graves! This world's no blot for us,"
6170,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good:"
6171,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,To find its meaning is my meat and drink.                         315
6172,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Aye, but you don't so instigate to prayer!"""
6173,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Strikes in the Prior: ""when your meaning's plain"
6174,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"It does not say to folk--remember matins,"
6175,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Or, mind you fast next Friday!"" Why, for this"
6176,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"What need of art at all? A skull and bones,                       320"
6177,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Two bits of stick nailed crosswise, or, what's best,"
6178,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A bell to chime the hour with, does as well."
6179,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I painted a Saint Laurence six months since
6180,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"At Prato, splashed the fresco in fine style:"
6181,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""How looks my painting, now the scaffold's down?""                 325"
6182,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I ask a brother: ""Hugely,"" he returns--"
6183,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Already not one phiz of your three slaves"
6184,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Who turn the Deacon off his toasted side,"
6185,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"But's scratched and prodded to our heart's content,"
6186,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The pious people have so eased their own                          330
6187,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,With coming to say prayers there in a rage:
6188,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,We get on fast to see the bricks beneath.
6189,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Expect another job this time next year,"
6190,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,For pity and religion grow i' the crowd--
6191,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Your painting serves its purpose!"" Hang the fools!                335"
6192,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
6193,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,--That is--you'll not mistake an idle word
6194,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Spoke in a huff by a poor monk, God wot,"
6195,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Tasting the air this spicy night which turns
6196,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The unaccustomed head like Chianti wine!
6197,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Oh, the church knows! don't misreport me, now!                    340"
6198,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,It's natural a poor monk out of bounds
6199,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Should have his apt word to excuse himself:
6200,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,And hearken how I plot to make amends.
6201,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I have bethought me: I shall paint a piece
6202,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"... There's for you! Give me six months, then go, see             345"
6203,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Something in Sant' Ambrogio's! Bless the nuns!
6204,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,They want a cast o' my office. I shall paint
6205,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"God in the midst, Madonna and her babe,"
6206,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Ringed by a bowery, flowery angel-brood,"
6207,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lilies and vestments and white faces, sweet                       350"
6208,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,As puff on puff of grated orris-root
6209,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,When ladies crowd to Church at midsummer.
6210,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And then i' the front, of course a saint or two--"
6211,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Saint John, because he saves the Florentines,"
6212,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Saint Ambrose, who puts down in black and white                   355"
6213,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The convent's friends and gives them a long day,"
6214,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And Job, I must have him there past mistake,"
6215,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The man of Uz (and Us without the z,"
6216,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Painters who need his patience). Well, all these"
6217,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Secured at their devotion, up shall come                          360"
6218,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Out of a corner when you least expect,"
6219,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"As one by a dark stair into a great light,"
6220,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Music and talking, who but Lippo! I!--"
6221,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Mazed, motionless, and moonstruck--I'm the man!"
6222,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Back I shrink--what is this I see and hear?                       365
6223,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I, caught up with my monk's-things by mistake,"
6224,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"My old serge gown and rope that goes all round,"
6225,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"I, in this presence, this pure company!"
6226,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Where's a hole, where's a corner for escape?"
6227,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Then steps a sweet angelic slip of a thing                        370
6228,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Forward, puts out a soft palm--""Not so fast!"""
6229,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"--Addresses the celestial presence, ""nay--"
6230,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"He made you and devised you, after all,"
6231,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Though he's none of you! Could Saint John there draw--
6232,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,His camel-hair make up a painting-brush?                          375
6233,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"We come to brother Lippo for all that,"
6234,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"_Iste perfecit opus!_"" So, all smile--"
6235,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,I shuffle sideways with my blushing face
6236,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Under the cover of a hundred wings
6237,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Thrown like a spread of kirtles when you're gay                   380
6238,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And play hot cockles, all the doors being shut,"
6239,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Till, wholly unexpected, in there pops"
6240,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,The hothead husband! Thus I scuttle off
6241,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"To some safe bench behind, not letting go"
6242,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The palm of her, the little lily thing                            385"
6243,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"That spoke the good word for me in the nick,"
6244,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Like the Prior's niece ... Saint Lucy, I would say."
6245,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"And so all's saved for me, and for the church"
6246,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"A pretty picture gained. Go, six months hence!"
6247,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Your hand, sir, and good-by: no lights, no lights!                390"
6248,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"The street's hushed, and I know my own way back,"
6249,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Don't fear me! There's the gray beginning. Zooks!

6778,CLEON,"The whole circumference of that emptied sphere,                   105"
6779,CLEON,Fills it more fully than the water did;
6780,CLEON,Holds thrice the weight of water in itself
6781,CLEON,Resolved into a subtler element.
6782,CLEON,And yet the vulgar call the sphere first full
6783,CLEON,"Up to the visible height--and after, void;                        110"
6784,CLEON,Not knowing air's more hidden properties.
6785,CLEON,"And thus our soul, misknown, cries out to Zeus"
6786,CLEON,To vindicate his purpose in our life:
6787,CLEON,Why stay we on the earth unless to grow?
6788,CLEON,"Long since, I imaged, wrote the fiction out,                      115"
6789,CLEON,That he or other god descended here
6790,CLEON,"And, once for all, showed simultaneously"
6791,CLEON,"What, in its nature, never can be shown,"
6792,CLEON,"Piecemeal or in succession--showed, I say,"
6793,CLEON,The worth both absolute and relative                              120
6794,CLEON,"Of all his children from the birth of time,"
6795,CLEON,His instruments for all appointed work.
6796,CLEON,I now go on to image--might we hear
6797,CLEON,"The judgment which should give the due to each,"
6798,CLEON,"Show where the labor lay and where the ease,                      125"
6799,CLEON,"And prove Zeus' self, the latent everywhere!"
6800,CLEON,"This is a dream--but no dream, let us hope,"
6801,CLEON,"That years and days, the summers and the springs,"
6802,CLEON,Follow each other with unwaning powers.
6803,CLEON,"The grapes which dye thy wine are richer far,                     130"
6804,CLEON,"Through culture, than the wild wealth of the rock;"
6805,CLEON,The suave plum than the savage-tasted drupe;
6806,CLEON,The pastured honey-bee drops choicer sweet;
6807,CLEON,"The flowers turn double, and the leaves turn flowers;"
6808,CLEON,"That young and tender crescent-moon, thy slave,                   135"
6809,CLEON,"Sleeping above her robe as buoyed by clouds,"
6810,CLEON,Refines upon the women of my youth.
6811,CLEON,"What, and the soul alone deteriorates?"
6812,CLEON,"I have not chanted verse like Homer, no--"
6813,CLEON,"Nor swept string like Terpander, no--nor carved                   140"
6814,CLEON,And painted men like Phidias and his friend:
6815,CLEON,"I am not great as they are, point by point."
6816,CLEON,But I have entered into sympathy
6817,CLEON,"With these four, running these into one soul,"
6818,CLEON,"Who, separate, ignored each other's art.                          145"
6819,CLEON,"Say, is it nothing that I know them all?"
6820,CLEON,The wild flower was the larger; I have dashed
6821,CLEON,"Rose-blood upon its petals, pricked its cup's"
6822,CLEON,"Honey with wine, and driven its seed to fruit,"
6823,CLEON,And show a better flower if not so large:                         150
6824,CLEON,I stand myself. Refer this to the gods
6825,CLEON,"Whose gift alone it is! which, shall I dare"
6826,CLEON,(All pride apart) upon the absurd pretext
6827,CLEON,"That such a gift by chance lay in my hand,"
6828,CLEON,Discourse of lightly or depreciate?                               155
6829,CLEON,It might have fallen to another's hand: what then?
6830,CLEON,I pass too surely: let at least truth stay!
6831,CLEON,
6832,CLEON,"And next, of what thou followest on to ask."
6833,CLEON,"This being with me as I declare, O king,"
6834,CLEON,"My works, in all these varicolored kinds,                         160"
6835,CLEON,"So done by me, accepted so by men--"
6836,CLEON,"Thou askest, if (my soul thus in men's hearts)"
6837,CLEON,I must not be accounted to attain
6838,CLEON,The very crown and proper end of life?
6839,CLEON,"Inquiring thence how, now life closeth up,                        165"
6840,CLEON,I face death with success in my right hand:
6841,CLEON,Whether I fear death less than dost thyself
6842,CLEON,"The fortunate of men? ""For"" (writest thou)"
6843,CLEON,"""Thou leavest much behind, while I leave naught."
6844,CLEON,"Thy life stays in the poems men shall sing,                       170"
6845,CLEON,"The pictures men shall study; while my life,"
6846,CLEON,"Complete and whole now in its power and joy,"
6847,CLEON,"Dies altogether with my brain and arm,"
6848,CLEON,"Is lost indeed; since, what survives myself?"
6849,CLEON,"The brazen statue to o'erlook my grave,                           175"
6850,CLEON,Set on the promontory which I named.
6851,CLEON,And that--some supple courtier of my heir
6852,CLEON,"Shall use its robed and sceptered arm, perhaps,"
6853,CLEON,"To fix the rope to, which best drags it down."
6854,CLEON,"I go then: triumph thou, who dost not go!""                        180"
6855,CLEON,
6856,CLEON,"Nay, thou art worthy of hearing my whole mind."
6857,CLEON,"Is this apparent, when thou turn'st to muse"
6858,CLEON,"Upon the scheme of earth and man in chief,"
6859,CLEON,That admiration grows as knowledge grows?
6860,CLEON,"That imperfection means perfection hid,                           185"
6861,CLEON,"Reserved in part, to grace the after-time?"
6862,CLEON,"If, in the morning of philosophy,"
6863,CLEON,"Ere aught had been recorded, nay perceived,"
6864,CLEON,"Thou, with the light now in thee, couldst have looked"
6865,CLEON,"On all earth's tenantry, from worm to bird,                       190"
6866,CLEON,"Ere man, her last, appeared upon the stage--"
6867,CLEON,"Thou wouldst have seen them perfect, and deduced"
6868,CLEON,The perfectness of others yet unseen.
6869,CLEON,"Conceding which--had Zeus then questioned thee,"
6870,CLEON,"""Shall I go on a step, improve on this,                           195"
6871,CLEON,"Do more for visible creatures than is done?"""
6872,CLEON,"Thou wouldst have answered, ""Aye, by making each"
6873,CLEON,Grow conscious in himself--by that alone.
6874,CLEON,"All's perfect else: the shell sucks fast the rock,"
6875,CLEON,"The fish strikes through the sea, the snake both swims            200"
6876,CLEON,"And slides, forth range the beasts, the birds take flight,"
6877,CLEON,Till life's mechanics can no further go--
6878,CLEON,And all this joy in natural life is put
6879,CLEON,"Like fire from off thy finger into each,"
6880,CLEON,So exquisitely perfect is the same.                               205
6881,CLEON,"But 'tis pure fire, and they mere matter are;"
6882,CLEON,"It has them, not they it: and so I choose"
6883,CLEON,"For man, thy last premeditated work"
6884,CLEON,"(If I might add a glory to the scheme),"
6885,CLEON,"That a third thing should stand apart from both,                  210"
6886,CLEON,"A quality arise within his soul,"
6887,CLEON,"Which, introactive, made to supervise"
6888,CLEON,"And feel the force it has, may view itself,"
6889,CLEON,"And so be happy."" Man might live at first"
6890,CLEON,The animal life: but is there nothing more?                       215
6891,CLEON,"In due time, let him critically learn"
6892,CLEON,"How he lives; and, the more he gets to know"
6893,CLEON,"Of his own life's adaptabilities,"
6894,CLEON,The more joy-giving will his life become.
6895,CLEON,"Thus man, who hath this quality, is best.                         220"
6896,CLEON,
6897,CLEON,"But thou, king, hadst more reasonably said:"
6898,CLEON,"""Let progress end at once--man make no step"
6899,CLEON,"Beyond the natural man, the better beast,"
6900,CLEON,"Using his senses, not the sense of sense."""
6901,CLEON,"In man there's failure, only since he left                        225"
6902,CLEON,The lower and inconscious forms of life.
6903,CLEON,"We called it an advance, the rendering plain"
6904,CLEON,"Man's spirit might grow conscious of man's life,"
6905,CLEON,"And, by new lore so added to the old,"
6906,CLEON,Take each step higher over the brute's head.                      230
6907,CLEON,"This grew the only life, the pleasure-house,"
6908,CLEON,"Watch-tower, and treasure-fortress of the soul,"
6909,CLEON,Which whole surrounding flats of natural life
6910,CLEON,Seemed only fit to yield subsistence to;
6911,CLEON,"A tower that crowns a country. But alas,                          235"
6912,CLEON,The soul now climbs it just to perish there!
6913,CLEON,For thence we have discovered ('tis no dream--
6914,CLEON,"We know this, which we had not else perceived)"
6915,CLEON,That there's a world of capability
6916,CLEON,"For joy, spread round about us, meant for us,                     240"
6917,CLEON,"Inviting us; and still the soul craves all,"
6918,CLEON,"And still the flesh replies, ""Take no jot more"
6919,CLEON,Than ere thou clombst the tower to look abroad!
6920,CLEON,"Nay, so much less as that fatigue has brought"
6921,CLEON,"Deduction to it."" We struggle, fain to enlarge                    245"
6922,CLEON,"Our bounded physical recipiency,"
6923,CLEON,"Increase our power, supply fresh oil to life,"
6924,CLEON,"Repair the waste of age and sickness: no,"
6925,CLEON,"It skills not! life's inadequate to joy,"
6926,CLEON,"As the soul sees joy, tempting life to take.                      250"
6927,CLEON,They praise a fountain in my garden here
6928,CLEON,Wherein a Naiad sends the water-bow
6929,CLEON,Thin from her tube; she smiles to see it rise.
6930,CLEON,"What if I told her, it is just a thread"
6931,CLEON,"From that great river which the hills shut up,                    255"
6932,CLEON,And mock her with my leave to take the same?
6933,CLEON,The artificer has given her one small tube
6934,CLEON,Past power to widen or exchange--what boots
6935,CLEON,To know she might spout oceans if she could?
6936,CLEON,She cannot lift beyond her first thin thread:                     260
6937,CLEON,And so a man can use but a man's joy
6938,CLEON,"While he sees God's. Is it for Zeus to boast,"
6939,CLEON,"""See, man, how happy I live, and despair--"
6940,CLEON,"That I may be still happier--for thy use!"""
6941,CLEON,"If this were so, we could not thank our Lord,                     265"
6942,CLEON,As hearts beat on to doing; 'tis not so--
6943,CLEON,Malice it is not. Is it carelessness?
6944,CLEON,"Still, no. If care--where is the sign? I ask,"
6945,CLEON,"And get no answer, and agree in sum,"
6946,CLEON,"O king, with thy profound discouragement,                         270"
6947,CLEON,Who seest the wider but to sigh the more.
6948,CLEON,Most progress is most failure: thou sayest well.
6949,CLEON,
6950,CLEON,The last point now:--thou dost except a case--
6951,CLEON,Holding joy not impossible to one
6952,CLEON,With artist-gifts--to such a man as I                             275
6953,CLEON,Who leave behind me living works indeed;
6954,CLEON,"For, such a poem, such a painting lives."
6955,CLEON,"What? Dost thou verily trip upon a word,"
6956,CLEON,Confound the accurate view of what joy is
6957,CLEON,(Caught somewhat clearer by my eyes than thine)                   280
6958,CLEON,With feeling joy? confound the knowing how
6959,CLEON,And showing how to live (my faculty)
6960,CLEON,With actually living?--Otherwise
6961,CLEON,Where is the artist's vantage o'er the king?
6962,CLEON,Because in my great epos I display                                285
6963,CLEON,"How divers men young, strong, fair, wise, can act--"
6964,CLEON,"Is this as though I acted? If I paint,"
6965,CLEON,"Carve the young Phoebus, am I therefore young?"
6966,CLEON,Methinks I'm older that I bowed myself
6967,CLEON,The many years of pain that taught me art!                        290
6968,CLEON,"Indeed, to know is something, and to prove"
6969,CLEON,"How all this beauty might be enjoyed, is more:"
6970,CLEON,"But, knowing naught, to enjoy is something, too."
6971,CLEON,"Yon rower, with the molded muscles there,"
6972,CLEON,"Lowering the sail, is nearer it than I.                           295"
6973,CLEON,I can write love-odes: thy fair slave's an ode.
6974,CLEON,"I get to sing of love, when grown too gray"
6975,CLEON,"For being beloved: she turns to that young man,"
6976,CLEON,The muscles all a-ripple on his back.
6977,CLEON,"I know the joy of kingship: well, thou art king!                  300"
6978,CLEON,
6979,CLEON,"""But,"" sayest thou--and I marvel, I repeat,"
6980,CLEON,"To find thee trip on such a mere word--""what"
6981,CLEON,"Thou writest, paintest, stays; that does not die:"
6982,CLEON,"Sappho survives, because we sing her songs,"
6983,CLEON,"And Æschylus, because we read his plays!""                         305"
6984,CLEON,"Why, if they live still, let them come and take"
6985,CLEON,"Thy slave in my despite, drink from thy cup,"
6986,CLEON,Speak in my place. Thou diest while I survive?
6987,CLEON,"Say rather that my fate is deadlier still,"
6988,CLEON,"In this, that every day my sense of joy                           310"
6989,CLEON,"Grows more acute, my soul (intensified"
6990,CLEON,"By power and insight) more enlarged, more keen;"
6991,CLEON,"While every day my hairs fall more and more,"
6992,CLEON,"My hand shakes, and the heavy years increase--"
6993,CLEON,"The horror quickening still from year to year,                    315"
6994,CLEON,"The consummation coming past escape,"
6995,CLEON,"When I shall know most, and yet least enjoy--"
6996,CLEON,"When all my works wherein I prove my worth,"
6997,CLEON,"Being present still to mock me in men's mouths,"
6998,CLEON,"Alive still, in the praise of such as thou,                       320"
6999,CLEON,"I, I the feeling, thinking, acting man,"
7000,CLEON,"The man who loved his life so overmuch,"
7001,CLEON,"Sleep in my urn. It is so horrible,"
7002,CLEON,I dare at times imagine to my need
7003,CLEON,"Some future state revealed to us by Zeus,                         325"
7004,CLEON,Unlimited in capability
7005,CLEON,"For joy, as this is in desire for joy,"
7006,CLEON,"--To seek which, the joy-hunger forces us:"
7007,CLEON,"That, stung by straitness of our life, made strait"
7008,CLEON,On purpose to make prized the life at large--                     330
7009,CLEON,"Freed, by the throbbing impulse we call death,"
7010,CLEON,"We burst there as the worm into the fly,"
7011,CLEON,"Who, while a worm still, wants his wings. But no!"
7012,CLEON,"Zeus has not yet revealed it; and alas,"
7013,CLEON,"He must have done so, were it possible!                           335"
7014,CLEON,
7015,CLEON,"Live long and happy, and in that thought die:"
7016,CLEON,"Glad for what was! Farewell. And for the rest,"
7017,CLEON,I cannot tell thy messenger aright
7018,CLEON,Where to deliver what he bears of thine
7019,CLEON,To one called Paulus; we have heard his fame                      340
7020,CLEON,"Indeed, if Christus be not one with him--"
7021,CLEON,"I know not, nor am troubled much to know."
7022,CLEON,"Thou canst not think a mere barbarian Jew,"
7023,CLEON,"As Paulus proves to be, one circumcised,"
7024,CLEON,Hath access to a secret shut from us?                             345
7025,CLEON,"Thou wrongest our philosophy, O king,"
7026,CLEON,"In stooping to inquire of such an one,"
7027,CLEON,As if his answer could impose at all!
7028,CLEON,"He writeth, doth he? Well, and he may write."
7029,CLEON,"Oh, the Jew findeth scholars! Certain slaves                      350"

7506,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Of power each side, perfection every turn:"

9221,VI,"Round his creep-hole, with never a break,                          55"
9222,VI,Ran my fires for his sake;
9223,VI,"Overhead, did my thunder combine"
9224,VI,With my underground mine:
9225,VI,Till I looked from my labor content
9226,VI,To enjoy the event.                                                60

9231,VII,"When sudden ... how think ye, the end?"
9232,VII,"Did I say ""without friend""?"
9233,VII,"Say, rather, from marge to blue marge"
9234,VII,The whole sky grew his targe
9235,VII,"With the sun's self for visible boss,                              65"
9236,VII,While an Arm ran across
9237,VII,Which the earth heaved beneath like a breast
9238,VII,Where the wretch was safe pressed!
9239,VII,"Do you see? Just my vengeance complete,"
9240,VII,"The man sprang to his feet,                                        70"
9241,VII,"Stood erect, caught at God's skirts, and prayed!"
9242,VII,"--So, _I_ was afraid!"

9247,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND
9248,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,
9249,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,
9250,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,That second time they hunted me
9251,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"From hill to plain, from shore to sea,"
9252,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And Austria, hounding far and wide"
9253,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Her bloodhounds through the countryside.
9254,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Breathed hot and instant on my trace--                              5
9255,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I made six days a hiding-place
9256,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Of that dry green old aqueduct
9257,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Where I and Charles, when boys, have plucked"
9258,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"The fireflies from the roof above,"
9259,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Bright creeping through the moss they love:                        10
9260,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,--How long it seems since Charles was lost!
9261,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Six days the soldiers crossed and crossed
9262,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,The country in my very sight;
9263,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And when that peril ceased at night,"
9264,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,The sky broke out in red dismay                                    15
9265,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"With signal fires; well, there I lay"
9266,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Close covered o'er in my recess,"
9267,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Up to the neck in ferns and cress,"
9268,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Thinking of Metternich our friend,"
9269,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And Charles's miserable end,                                       20"
9270,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And much beside, two days; the third,"
9271,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Hunger o'ercame me when I heard
9272,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,The peasants from the village go
9273,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"To work among the maize; you know,"
9274,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"With us in Lombardy, they bring                                    25"
9275,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Provisions packed on mules, a string"
9276,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"With little bells that cheer their task,"
9277,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And casks, and boughs on every cask"
9278,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,To keep the sun's heat from the wine;
9279,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"These I let pass in jingling line,                                 30"
9280,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And, close on them, dear noisy crew,"
9281,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"The peasants from the village, too;"
9282,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,For at the very rear would troop
9283,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Their wives and sisters in a group
9284,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"To help, I knew. When these had passed,                            35"
9285,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"I threw my glove to strike the last,"
9286,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Taking the chance; she did not start,"
9287,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Much less cry out, but stooped apart,"
9288,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"One instant rapidly glanced round,"
9289,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And saw me beckon from the ground;                                 40
9290,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,A wild bush grows and hides my crypt;
9291,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,She picked my glove up while she stripped
9292,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"A branch off, then rejoined the rest"
9293,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,With that; my glove lay in her breast.
9294,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Then I drew breath; they disappeared;                              45
9295,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,It was for Italy I feared.
9296,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,
9297,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"An hour, and she returned alone"
9298,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Exactly where my glove was thrown.
9299,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Meanwhile came many thoughts; on me
9300,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Rested the hopes of Italy;                                         50
9301,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I had devised a certain tale
9302,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Which, when 'twas told her, could not fail"
9303,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Persuade a peasant of its truth;
9304,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I meant to call a freak of youth
9305,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"This hiding, and give hopes of pay,                                55"
9306,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And no temptation to betray.
9307,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"But when I saw that woman's face,"
9308,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Its calm simplicity of grace,"
9309,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Our Italy's own attitude
9310,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"In which she walked thus far, and stood,                           60"
9311,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Planting each naked foot so firm,"
9312,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,To crush the snake and spare the worm--
9313,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"At first sight of her eyes, I said,"
9314,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"""I am that man upon whose head"
9315,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"They fix the price, because I hate                                 65"
9316,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,The Austrians over us; the State
9317,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Will give you gold--oh, gold so much!--"
9318,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"If you betray me to their clutch,"
9319,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And be your death, for aught I know,"
9320,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,If once they find you saved their foe.                             70
9321,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Now you must bring me food and drink,"
9322,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And also paper, pen, and ink,"
9323,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And carry safe what I shall write
9324,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"To Padua, which you'll reach at night"
9325,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Before the duomo shuts; go in,                                     75"
9326,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And wait till Tenebræ begin;
9327,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Walk to the third confessional,"
9328,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Between the pillar and the wall,"
9329,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And kneeling whisper, _Whence comes peace?_"
9330,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Say it a second time, then cease;                                  80"
9331,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And if the voice inside returns,"
9332,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,_From Christ and Freedom; what concerns_
9333,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"_The cause of Peace?_--for answer, slip"
9334,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,My letter where you placed your lip;

9336,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Our mother service--I, the son,"
9337,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"As you the daughter of our land!"""
9338,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,
9339,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Three mornings more, she took her stand"
9340,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"In the same place, with the same eyes;"
9341,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I was no surer of sunrise                                          90
9342,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Than of her coming. We conferred
9343,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Of her own prospects, and I heard"
9344,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"She had a lover--stout and tall,"
9345,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"She said--then let her eyelids fall,"
9346,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"""He could do much""--as if some doubt                               95"
9347,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Entered her heart--then, passing out,"
9348,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"""She could not speak for others, who"
9349,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Had other thoughts; herself she knew"";"
9350,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And so she brought me drink and food.
9351,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,After four days the scouts pursued                                100
9352,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Another path; at last arrived
9353,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,The help my Paduan friends contrived
9354,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,To furnish me; she brought the news.
9355,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,For the first time I could not choose
9356,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"But kiss her hand, and lay my own                                 105"
9357,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Upon her head--""This faith was shown"
9358,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"To Italy, our mother; she"
9359,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Uses my hand and blesses thee."""
9360,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,She followed down to the seashore;
9361,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I left and never saw her more.                                    110
9362,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,
9363,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,How very long since I have thought
9364,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Concerning--much less wished for--aught
9365,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Beside the good of Italy,"
9366,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,For which I live and mean to die!
9367,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I never was in love; and since                                    115
9368,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Charles proved false, what shall now convince"
9369,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,My inmost heart I have a friend?
9370,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"However, if I pleased to spend"
9371,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Real wishes on myself--say, three--"
9372,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I know at least what one should be.                               120
9373,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I would grasp Metternich until
9374,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,I felt his red wet throat distill
9375,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,In blood through these two hands. And next
9376,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,--Nor much for that am I perplexed--
9377,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Charles, perjured traitor, for his part,                          125"
9378,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Should die slow of a broken heart
9379,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Under his new employers. Last
9380,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"--Ah, there, what should I wish? For fast"
9381,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Do I grow old and out of strength.
9382,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,If I resolved to seek at length                                   130
9383,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"My father's house again, how scared"
9384,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"They all would look, and unprepared!"
9385,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,My brothers live in Austria's pay
9386,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"--Disowned me long ago, men say;"
9387,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And all my early mates who used                                   135
9388,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,To praise me so--perhaps induced
9389,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,More than one early step of mine--
9390,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Are turning wise; while some opine,"
9391,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"""Freedom grows license,"" some suspect,"
9392,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"""Haste breeds delay,"" and recollect                               140"
9393,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"They always said, such premature"
9394,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Beginnings never could endure!
9395,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"So, with a sullen ""All's for best,"""
9396,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,The land seems settling to its rest.
9397,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"I think then, I should wish to stand                              145"
9398,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"This evening in that dear, lost land,"
9399,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Over the sea the thousand miles,"
9400,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And know if yet that woman smiles
9401,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,With the calm smile; some little farm
9402,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"She lives in there, no doubt; what harm                           150"
9403,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"If I sat on the door-side bench,"
9404,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And, while her spindle made a trench"
9405,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Fantastically in the dust,"
9406,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Inquired of all her fortunes--just
9407,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Her children's ages and their names,                              155"
9408,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,And what may be the husband's aims
9409,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"For each of them. I'd talk this out,"
9410,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"And sit there, for an hour about,"
9411,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Then kiss her hand once more, and lay"
9412,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"Mine on her head, and go my way.                                  160"

9574,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,
9575,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Day!
9576,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Faster and more fast,"
9577,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"O'er night's brim, day boils at last;"
9578,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Boils, pure gold, o'er the cloud-cup's brim"
9579,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Where spurting and suppressed it lay,                               5"
9580,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,For not a froth-flake touched the rim
9581,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Of yonder gap in the solid gray
9582,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Of the eastern cloud, an hour away;"
9583,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"But forth one wavelet, then another, curled,"
9584,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Till the whole sunrise, not to be suppressed,                      10"
9585,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Rose, reddened, and its seething breast"
9586,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Flickered in bounds, grew gold, than overflowed the world."
9587,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,
9588,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Oh, Day, if I squander a wavelet of thee,"
9589,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"A mite of my twelve hours' treasure,"
9590,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,The least of thy gazes or glances                                  15
9591,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"(Be they grants thou art bound to or gifts above measure),"
9592,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"One of thy choices or one of thy chances,"

9617,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Sole light that helps me through the year, thy sun's!"
9618,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Try now! Take Asolo's Four Happiest Ones--
9619,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,And let thy morning rain on that superb
9620,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Great haughty Ottima; can rain disturb
9621,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Her Sebald's homage? All the while thy rain                        45
9622,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Beats fiercest on her shrub-house windowpane,"
9623,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"He will but press the closer, breathe more warm"
9624,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Against her cheek; how should she mind the storm?
9625,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"And, morning past, if midday shed a gloom"
9626,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,O'er Jules and Phene--what care bride and groom                    50
9627,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Save for their dear selves? 'Tis their marriage-day;
9628,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"And while they leave church and go home their way,"
9629,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Hand clasping hand, within each breast would be"
9630,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Sunbeams and pleasant weather spite of thee.
9631,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Then, for another trial, obscure thy eve                           55"
9632,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,With mist--will Luigi and his mother grieve--
9633,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"The lady and her child, unmatched, forsooth,"
9634,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"She in her age, as Luigi in his youth,"
9635,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"For true content? The cheerful town, warm, close,"
9636,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"And safe, the sooner that thou art morose,                         60"
9637,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Receives them. And yet once again, outbreak"
9638,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"In storm at night on Monsignor, they make"
9639,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Such stir about--whom they expect from Rome
9640,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"To visit Asolo, his brothers' home,"
9641,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,And say here masses proper to release                              65
9642,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,A soul from pain--what storm dares hurt his peace?
9643,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Calm would he pray, with his own thoughts to ward"
9644,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Thy thunder off, nor want the angels' guard."
9645,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,But Pippa--just one such mischance would spoil
9646,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Her day that lightens the next twelve-month's toil                 70
9647,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"At wearisome silk-winding, coil on coil!"
9648,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,And here I let time slip for naught!
9649,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Aha, you foolhardy sunbeam, caught"
9650,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,With a single splash from my ewer!
9651,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"You that would mock the best pursuer,                              75"
9652,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Was my basin over-deep?
9653,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"One splash of water ruins you asleep,"
9654,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"And up, up, fleet your brilliant bits"
9655,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Wheeling and counterwheeling,"
9656,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Reeling, broken beyond healing--                                   80"
9657,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Now grow together on the ceiling!
9658,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,That will task your wits.
9659,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Whoever it was quenched fire first, hoped to see"
9660,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Morsel after morsel flee
9661,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"As merrily, as giddily ...                                         85"
9662,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Meantime, what lights my sunbeam on,"
9663,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Where settles by degrees the radiant cripple?
9664,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Oh, is it surely blown, my martagon?"
9665,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"New-blown and ruddy as St. Agnes' nipple,"
9666,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Plump as the flesh-bunch on some Turk bird's poll!                 90
9667,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Be sure if corals, branching 'neath the ripple"
9668,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Of ocean, bud there, fairies watch unroll"
9669,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Such turban-flowers; I say, such lamps disperse"
9670,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Thick red flame through that dusk green universe!
9671,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"I am queen of thee, floweret!                                      95"
9672,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,And each fleshy blossom
9673,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Preserve I not--safer
9674,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Than leaves that embower it,"
9675,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Or shells that embosom--
9676,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,From weevil and chafer?                                           100
9677,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Laugh through my pane then; solicit the bee;
9678,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Gibe him, be sure; and, in midst of thy glee,"
9679,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Love thy queen, worship me!"
9680,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,
9681,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"--Worship whom else? For am I not, this day,"
9682,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Whate'er I please? What shall I please today?                     105
9683,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"My morn, noon, eve, and night--how spend my day?"
9684,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Tomorrow I must be Pippa who winds silk,"
9685,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"The whole year round, to earn just bread and milk."
9686,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"But, this one day, I have leave to go,"
9687,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,And play out my fancy's fullest games;                            110
9688,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,I may fancy all day--and it shall be so--
9689,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"That I taste of the pleasures, am called by the names"
9690,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Of the Happiest Four in our Asolo!
9691,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,
9692,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"See! Up the hillside yonder, through the morning,"
9693,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Someone shall love me, as the world calls love;                   115"
9694,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"I am no less than Ottima, take warning!"
9695,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"The gardens, and the great stone house above,"
9696,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"And other house for shrubs, all glass in front,"
9697,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Are mine; where Sebald steals, as he is wont,"
9698,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"To court me, while old Luca yet reposes;                          120"
9699,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"And therefore, till the shrub-house door uncloses,"
9700,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,I--what now?--give abundant cause for prate
9701,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"About me--Ottima, I mean--of late,"
9702,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Too bold, too confident she'll still face down"
9703,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,The spitefullest of talkers in our town.                          125
9704,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,How we talk in the little town below!
9705,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"But love, love, love--there's better love, I know!"
9706,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,This foolish love was only day's first offer;
9707,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,I choose my next love to defy the scoffer;
9708,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,For do not our Bride and Bridegroom sally                         130
9709,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Out of Possagno church at noon?
9710,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Their house looks over Orcana valley--
9711,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Why should not I be the bride as soon
9712,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"As Ottima? For I saw, beside,"
9713,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Arrive last night that little bride--                             135
9714,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Saw, if you call it seeing her, one flash"
9715,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Of the pale snow-pure cheek and black bright tresses,"
9716,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Blacker than all except the black eyelash;
9717,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,I wonder she contrives those lids no dresses!
9718,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"So strict was she, the veil                                       140"
9719,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Should cover close her pale
9720,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Pure cheeks--a bride to look at and scarce touch,"
9721,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Scarce touch, remember, Jules! For are not such"
9722,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Used to be tended, flower-like, every feature,"
9723,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,As if one's breath would fray the lily of a creature?             145
9724,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,A soft and easy life these ladies lead!
9725,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Whiteness in us were wonderful indeed.
9726,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Oh, save that brow its virgin dimness,"
9727,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Keep that foot its lady primness,"
9728,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Let those ankles never swerve                                     150
9729,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"From their exquisite reserve,"
9730,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Yet have to trip along the streets like me,"
9731,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,All but naked to the knee!
9732,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,How will she ever grant her Jules a bliss
9733,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,So startling as her real first infant kiss?                       155
9734,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Oh, no--not envy, this!"
9735,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,
9736,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"--Not envy, sure!--for if you gave me"
9737,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Leave to take or to refuse,"
9738,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"In earnest, do you think I'd choose"
9739,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,That sort of new love to enslave me?                              160
9740,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Mine should have lapped me round from the beginning;
9741,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,As little fear of losing it as winning;
9742,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Lovers grow cold, men learn to hate their wives,"
9743,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,And only parents' love can last our lives.
9744,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"At eve the Son and Mother, gentle pair,                           165"
9745,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Commune inside our turret; what prevents
9746,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,My being Luigi? While that mossy lair
9747,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Of lizards through the wintertime is stirred
9748,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,With each to each imparting sweet intents
9749,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"For this new-year, as brooding bird to bird                       170"
9750,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"(For I observe of late, the evening walk"
9751,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Of Luigi and his mother, always ends"

9758,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Nay, if you come to that, best love of all"

9760,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,"Myself as, in the palace by the Dome,"

9765,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Would be that holy and beloved priest.
9766,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,
9767,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,Now wait!--even I already seem to share
9768,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,In God's love: what does New-year's hymn declare?
9769,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,What other meaning do these verses bear?
9770,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,
9771,NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ASOLO IN THE TREVISAN,_All service ranks the same with God:_                          190

9807,I. MORNING,_Let the watching lids wink!
9808,I. MORNING,"Day's ablaze with eyes, think!"
9809,I. MORNING,"Deep into the night, drink!_"
9810,I. MORNING,
9811,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._ Night? Such may be your Rhineland nights, perhaps;"
9812,I. MORNING,But this blood-red beam through the shutter's chink                 5
9813,I. MORNING,--We call such light the morning: let us see!
9814,I. MORNING,"Mind how you grope your way, though! How these tall"
9815,I. MORNING,Naked geraniums straggle! Push the lattice
9816,I. MORNING,"Behind that frame!--Nay, do I bid you?--Sebald,"
9817,I. MORNING,"It shakes the dust down on me! Why, of course                      10"
9818,I. MORNING,"The slide-bolt catches. Well, are you content,"
9819,I. MORNING,Or must I find you something else to spoil?
9820,I. MORNING,"Kiss and be friends, my Sebald! Is 't full morning?"
9821,I. MORNING,"Oh, don't speak then!"
9822,I. MORNING,
9823,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._             Aye, thus it used to be."
9824,I. MORNING,"Ever your house was, I remember, shut                              15"
9825,I. MORNING,"Till midday; I observed that, as I strolled"
9826,I. MORNING,On mornings through the vale here; country girls
9827,I. MORNING,"Were noisy, washing garments in the brook,"
9828,I. MORNING,Hinds drove the slow white oxen up the hills;
9829,I. MORNING,"But no, your house was mute, would ope no eye.                     20"
9830,I. MORNING,"And wisely; you were plotting one thing there,"
9831,I. MORNING,"Nature, another outside. I looked up--"
9832,I. MORNING,"Rough white wood shutters, rusty iron bars,"
9833,I. MORNING,"Silent as death, blind in a flood of light,"
9834,I. MORNING,"Oh, I remember!--and the peasants laughed                          25"
9835,I. MORNING,"And said, ""The old man sleeps with the young wife."""
9836,I. MORNING,"This house was his, this chair, this window--his!"
9837,I. MORNING,
9838,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._ Ah, the clear morning! I can see St. Mark's;"
9839,I. MORNING,That black streak is the belfry. Stop: Vicenza

9841,I. MORNING,"Look o'er my shoulder, follow my finger!"
9842,I. MORNING,
9843,I. MORNING,_Sebald._                              Morning?
9844,I. MORNING,It seems to me a night with a sun added.
9845,I. MORNING,"Where's dew, where's freshness? That bruised plant, I bruised"
9846,I. MORNING,"In getting through the lattice yestereve,"
9847,I. MORNING,"Droops as it did. See, here's my elbow's mark                      35"
9848,I. MORNING,I' the dust o' the sill.
9849,I. MORNING,
9850,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._                Oh, shut the lattice, pray!"
9851,I. MORNING,
9852,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._ Let me lean out. I cannot scent blood here,"
9853,I. MORNING,Foul as the morn may be.
9854,I. MORNING,"There, shut the world out!"
9855,I. MORNING,"How do you feel now, Ottima? There, curse"
9856,I. MORNING,The world and all outside! Let us throw off                        40
9857,I. MORNING,This mask: how do you bear yourself? Let's out
9858,I. MORNING,With all of it.
9859,I. MORNING,
9860,I. MORNING,_Ottima._       Best never speak of it.
9861,I. MORNING,
9862,I. MORNING,_Sebald._ Best speak again and yet again of it.
9863,I. MORNING,"Till words cease to be more than words. ""His blood,"""
9864,I. MORNING,"For instance--let those two words mean ""His blood""                 45"
9865,I. MORNING,"And nothing more. Notice, I'll say them now,"
9866,I. MORNING,"""His blood."""
9867,I. MORNING,
9868,I. MORNING,_Ottima._      Assuredly if I repented
9869,I. MORNING,The deed--
9870,I. MORNING,
9871,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._ Repent? Who should repent, or why?"
9872,I. MORNING,What puts that in your head? Did I once say
9873,I. MORNING,That I repented?
9874,I. MORNING,
9875,I. MORNING,_Ottima._         No; I said the deed--                            50
9876,I. MORNING,
9877,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._ ""The deed"" and ""the event""--just now it was"
9878,I. MORNING,"""Our passion's fruit""--the devil take such cant!"
9879,I. MORNING,"Say, once and always, Luca was a wittol,"
9880,I. MORNING,"I am his cutthroat, you are--"
9881,I. MORNING,
9882,I. MORNING,_Ottima._                      Here's the wine;
9883,I. MORNING,"I brought it when we left the house above,                         55"
9884,I. MORNING,And glasses too--wine of both sorts. Black? White then?
9885,I. MORNING,
9886,I. MORNING,_Sebald._ But am not I his cutthroat? What are you?
9887,I. MORNING,
9888,I. MORNING,_Ottima._ There trudges on his business from the Duomo
9889,I. MORNING,"Benet the Capuchin, with his brown hood"
9890,I. MORNING,"And bare feet; always in one place at church,                      60"
9891,I. MORNING,Close under the stone wall by the south entry.
9892,I. MORNING,I used to take him for a brown cold piece
9893,I. MORNING,"Of the wall's self, as out of it he rose"
9894,I. MORNING,"To let me pass--at first, I say, I used--"
9895,I. MORNING,"Now, so has that dumb figure fastened on me,                       65"
9896,I. MORNING,I rather should account the plastered wall
9897,I. MORNING,"A piece of him, so chilly does it strike."
9898,I. MORNING,"This, Sebald?"
9899,I. MORNING,
9900,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._      No, the white wine--the white wine!"
9901,I. MORNING,"Well, Ottima, I promised no new year"
9902,I. MORNING,Should rise on us the ancient shameful way;                        70
9903,I. MORNING,Nor does it rise. Pour on! To your black eyes!
9904,I. MORNING,Do you remember last damned New Year's day?
9905,I. MORNING,
9906,I. MORNING,_Ottima._ You brought those foreign prints. We looked at them
9907,I. MORNING,Over the wine and fruit. I had to scheme
9908,I. MORNING,To get him from the fire. Nothing but saying                       75
9909,I. MORNING,"His own set wants the proof-mark, roused him up"
9910,I. MORNING,To hunt them out.
9911,I. MORNING,
9912,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._     'Faith, he is not alive"
9913,I. MORNING,To fondle you before my face.
9914,I. MORNING,
9915,I. MORNING,_Ottima._                 Do you
9916,I. MORNING,Fondle me then! Who means to take your life
9917,I. MORNING,"For that, my Sebald?                                               80"
9918,I. MORNING,
9919,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._       Hark you, Ottima!"
9920,I. MORNING,One thing to guard against. We'll not make much
9921,I. MORNING,"One of the other--that is, not make more"
9922,I. MORNING,"Parade of warmth, childish officious coil,"
9923,I. MORNING,"Than yesterday--as if, sweet, I supposed"
9924,I. MORNING,"Proof upon proof were needed now, now first,                       85"
9925,I. MORNING,"To show I love you--yes, still love you--love you"
9926,I. MORNING,In spite of Luca and what's come to him--
9927,I. MORNING,"Sure sign we had him ever in our thoughts,"
9928,I. MORNING,White sneering old reproachful face and all!
9929,I. MORNING,"We'll even quarrel, love, at times, as if                          90"
9930,I. MORNING,"We still could lose each other, were not tied"
9931,I. MORNING,By this--conceive you?
9932,I. MORNING,
9933,I. MORNING,_Ottima._         Love!
9934,I. MORNING,
9935,I. MORNING,_Sebald._                   Not tied so sure!
9936,I. MORNING,"Because though I was wrought upon, have struck"
9937,I. MORNING,His insolence back into him--am I
9938,I. MORNING,So surely yours?--therefore forever yours?                         95
9939,I. MORNING,
9940,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._ Love, to be wise (one counsel pays another),"
9941,I. MORNING,"Should we have--months ago, when first we loved,"
9942,I. MORNING,For instance that May morning we two stole
9943,I. MORNING,Under the green ascent of sycamores--If
9944,I. MORNING,we had come upon a thing like that                                100
9945,I. MORNING,Suddenly--
9946,I. MORNING,
9947,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._ ""A thing""--there again--""a thing!"""
9948,I. MORNING,
9949,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._ Then, Venus' body, had we come upon"
9950,I. MORNING,My husband Luca Gaddi's murdered corpse
9951,I. MORNING,"Within there, at his couch-foot, covered close--"
9952,I. MORNING,Would you have pored upon it? Why persist                         105
9953,I. MORNING,In poring now upon it? For 'tis here
9954,I. MORNING,As much as there in the deserted house;
9955,I. MORNING,"You cannot rid your eyes of it. For me,"
9956,I. MORNING,Now he is dead I hate him worse; I hate--
9957,I. MORNING,Dare you stay here? I would go back and hold                      110
9958,I. MORNING,"His two dead hands, and say, ""I hate you worse,"
9959,I. MORNING,"Luca, than""--"
9960,I. MORNING,
9961,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._      Off, off--take your hands off mine,"
9962,I. MORNING,"'Tis the hot evening--off! oh, morning, is it?"
9963,I. MORNING,
9964,I. MORNING,_Ottima._ There's one thing must be done--you know what thing.
9965,I. MORNING,Come in and help to carry. We may sleep                           115
9966,I. MORNING,Anywhere in the whole wide house tonight.
9967,I. MORNING,
9968,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._ What would come, think you, if we let him lie"
9969,I. MORNING,Just as he is? Let him lie there until
9970,I. MORNING,The angels take him! He is turned by this
9971,I. MORNING,"Off from his face beside, as you will see.                        120"
9972,I. MORNING,
9973,I. MORNING,_Ottima._ This dusty pane might serve for looking-glass.
9974,I. MORNING,"Three, four--four gray hairs! Is it so you said"
9975,I. MORNING,A plait of hair should wave across my neck?
9976,I. MORNING,No--this way.
9977,I. MORNING,
9978,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._ Ottima, I would give your neck,"
9979,I. MORNING,"Each splendid shoulder, both those breasts of yours,              125"
9980,I. MORNING,"That this were undone! Killing! Kill the world,"
9981,I. MORNING,"So Luca lives again!--aye, lives to sputter"
9982,I. MORNING,"His fulsome dotage on you--yes, and feign"
9983,I. MORNING,"Surprise that I return at eve to sup,"
9984,I. MORNING,When all the morning I was loitering here--                       130
9985,I. MORNING,Bid me dispatch my business and begone.
9986,I. MORNING,I would--
9987,I. MORNING,
9988,I. MORNING,_Ottima._  See!
9989,I. MORNING,
9990,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._       No, I'll finish. Do you think"
9991,I. MORNING,I fear to speak the bare truth once for all?
9992,I. MORNING,"All we have talked of, is at bottom, fine"
9993,I. MORNING,To suffer; there's a recompense in guilt;                         135
9994,I. MORNING,One must be venturous and fortunate--
9995,I. MORNING,"What is one young for, else? In age we'll sigh"
9996,I. MORNING,"O'er the wild, reckless, wicked days flown over;"
9997,I. MORNING,"Still, we have lived; the vice was in its place."
9998,I. MORNING,"But to have eaten Luca's bread, have worn                         140"
9999,I. MORNING,"His clothes, have felt his money swell my purse--"
10000,I. MORNING,Do lovers in romances sin that way?
10001,I. MORNING,"Why, I was starving when I used to call"
10002,I. MORNING,"And teach you music, starving while you plucked me"
10003,I. MORNING,These flowers to smell!                                           145
10004,I. MORNING,
10005,I. MORNING,_Ottima._          My poor lost friend!
10006,I. MORNING,
10007,I. MORNING,_Sebald._                               He gave me
10008,I. MORNING,"Life, nothing else; what if he did reproach"
10009,I. MORNING,"My perfidy, and threaten, and do more--"
10010,I. MORNING,Had he no right? What was to wonder at?
10011,I. MORNING,He sat by us at table quietly--
10012,I. MORNING,Why must you lean across till our cheeks touched?                 150
10013,I. MORNING,Could he do less than make pretense to strike?
10014,I. MORNING,'Tis not the crime's sake--I'd commit ten crimes
10015,I. MORNING,"Greater, to have this crime wiped out, undone!"
10016,I. MORNING,"And you--oh, how feel you? Feel you for me?"
10017,I. MORNING,
10018,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._ Well then, I love you better now than ever,             155"
10019,I. MORNING,And best (look at me while I speak to you)--
10020,I. MORNING,"Best for the crime; nor do I grieve, in truth,"
10021,I. MORNING,"This mask, this simulated ignorance,"
10022,I. MORNING,"This affectation of simplicity,"
10023,I. MORNING,Falls off our crime; this naked crime of ours                     160
10024,I. MORNING,May not now be looked over--look it down!
10025,I. MORNING,"Great? Let it be great; but the joys it brought,"
10026,I. MORNING,Pay they or no its price? Come: they or it
10027,I. MORNING,"Speak not! The past, would you give up the past"
10028,I. MORNING,"Such as it is, pleasure and crime together?                       165"
10029,I. MORNING,Give up that noon I owned my love for you?
10030,I. MORNING,The garden's silence! even the single bee
10031,I. MORNING,"Persisting in his toil, suddenly stopped,"
10032,I. MORNING,And where he hid you only could surmise
10033,I. MORNING,By some campanula chalice set a-swing.                            170
10034,I. MORNING,"Who stammered--""Yes, I love you?"""
10035,I. MORNING,
10036,I. MORNING,_Sebald._                     And I drew
10037,I. MORNING,Back; put far back your face with both my hands
10038,I. MORNING,Lest you should grow too full of me--your face
10039,I. MORNING,So seemed athirst for my whole soul and body!
10040,I. MORNING,
10041,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._ And when I ventured to receive you here,                175"
10042,I. MORNING,Made you steal hither in the mornings--
10043,I. MORNING,
10044,I. MORNING,_Sebald._                           When
10045,I. MORNING,"I used to look up 'neath the shrub-house here,"
10046,I. MORNING,Till the red fire on its glazed windows spread
10047,I. MORNING,To a yellow haze?
10048,I. MORNING,
10049,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._          Ah--my sign was, the sun"
10050,I. MORNING,Inflamed the sear side of yon chestnut-tree                       180
10051,I. MORNING,Nipped by the first frost.
10052,I. MORNING,
10053,I. MORNING,_Sebald._                   You would always laugh
10054,I. MORNING,At my wet boots: I had to stride through grass
10055,I. MORNING,Over my ankles.
10056,I. MORNING,
10057,I. MORNING,_Ottima._       Then our crowning night!
10058,I. MORNING,
10059,I. MORNING,_Sebald._ The July night?
10060,I. MORNING,
10061,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._                 The day of it too, Sebald!"
10062,I. MORNING,"When heaven's pillars seemed o'erbowed with heat,                 185"
10063,I. MORNING,Its black-blue canopy suffered descend
10064,I. MORNING,"Close on us both, to weigh down each to each,"
10065,I. MORNING,And smother up all life except our life.
10066,I. MORNING,So lay we till the storm came.
10067,I. MORNING,
10068,I. MORNING,_Sebald._                      How it came!
10069,I. MORNING,
10070,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._ Buried in woods we lay, you recollect;                  190"
10071,I. MORNING,Swift ran the searching tempest overhead;
10072,I. MORNING,And ever and anon some bright white shaft
10073,I. MORNING,"Burned through the pine-tree roof, here burned and there,"
10074,I. MORNING,As if God's messenger through the close wood screen
10075,I. MORNING,"Plunged and replunged his weapon at a venture,                    195"
10076,I. MORNING,Feeling for guilty thee and me; then broke
10077,I. MORNING,The thunder like a whole sea overhead--
10078,I. MORNING,
10079,I. MORNING,*       *       *       *       *
10080,I. MORNING,
10081,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._                                Slower, Ottima!"
10082,I. MORNING,Do not lean on me!
10083,I. MORNING,
10084,I. MORNING,"_Ottima._          Sebald, as we lay,"
10085,I. MORNING,"Who said, ""Let death come now! 'Tis right to die!"
10086,I. MORNING,Right to be punished! Naught completes such bliss                 200
10087,I. MORNING,"But woe!"" Who said that?"
10088,I. MORNING,
10089,I. MORNING,_Sebald._                 How did we ever rise?
10090,I. MORNING,Was't that we slept? Why did it end?
10091,I. MORNING,
10092,I. MORNING,_Ottima._                       I felt you
10093,I. MORNING,Taper into a point the ruffled ends
10094,I. MORNING,Of my loose locks 'twixt both your humid lips.
10095,I. MORNING,My hair is fallen now: knot it again!                             205
10096,I. MORNING,
10097,I. MORNING,"_Sebald._ I kiss you now, dear Ottima, now and now!"
10098,I. MORNING,This way? Will you forgive me--be once more
10099,I. MORNING,My great queen?
10100,I. MORNING,
10101,I. MORNING,_Ottima._        Bind it thrice about my brow;
10102,I. MORNING,"Crown me your queen, your spirit's arbitress,"
10103,I. MORNING,Magnificent in sin. Say that!
10104,I. MORNING,
10105,I. MORNING,_Sebald._                     I crown you                         210
10106,I. MORNING,"My great white queen, my spirit's arbitress,"
10107,I. MORNING,Magnificent--

10109,I. MORNING,[_From without is heard the voice of_ PIPPA _singing_--

10140,I. MORNING,
10141,I. MORNING,_Ottima._                                  Miserable!

10151,I. MORNING,"Drops, a dead web!"

10196,I. MORNING,"A hurry-down within me, as of waters"

10220,I. MORNING,"is this prophetical epitaph appended already, as"
10221,I. MORNING,"Bluphocks assures me--""_Here a mammoth-poem lies,                  15"

10231,I. MORNING,"was over by ten o'clock, Jules will certainly be here"
10232,I. MORNING,in a minute with his bride.                                        25
10233,I. MORNING,
10234,I. MORNING,"_2nd Student._ Good!--Only, so should the poet's muse"

10236,I. MORNING,canibus nostris_--and Delia not better known to our
10237,I. MORNING,literary dogs than the boy Giovacchino!
10238,I. MORNING,
10239,I. MORNING,"_1st Student._ To the point now. Where's Gottlieb,                 30"
10240,I. MORNING,"the new-comer? Oh--listen, Gottlieb, to what has called"
10241,I. MORNING,"down this piece of friendly vengeance on Jules, of which"
10242,I. MORNING,we now assemble to witness the winding-up. We are all
10243,I. MORNING,"agreed, all in a tale, observe, when Jules shall burst out"
10244,I. MORNING,on us in a fury by and by: I am spokesman--the verses              35
10245,I. MORNING,that are to undeceive Jules bear my name of Lutwyche--but
10246,I. MORNING,each professes himself alike insulted by this strutting
10247,I. MORNING,"stone-squarer, who came alone from Paris to Munich,"
10248,I. MORNING,and thence with a crowd of us to Venice and Possagno
10249,I. MORNING,"here, but proceeds in a day or two alone again--oh, alone          40"
10250,I. MORNING,"indubitably!--to Rome and Florence. He, forsooth, take"
10251,I. MORNING,"up his portion with these dissolute, brutalized, heartless"
10252,I. MORNING,"bunglers!--so he was heard to call us all: now, is Schramm"
10253,I. MORNING,"brutalized, I should like to know? Am I heartless?"
10254,I. MORNING,
10255,I. MORNING,"_Gottlieb._ Why, somewhat heartless; for, suppose Jules            45"
10256,I. MORNING,"a coxcomb as much as you choose, still, for this mere"
10257,I. MORNING,"coxcombry, you will have brushed off--what do folks"
10258,I. MORNING,style it?--the bloom of his life.
10259,I. MORNING,
10260,I. MORNING,"Is it too late to alter? These love-letters now, you"
10261,I. MORNING,call his--I can't laugh at them.                                   50
10262,I. MORNING,
10263,I. MORNING,_4th Student._ Because you never read the sham letters
10264,I. MORNING,of our inditing which drew forth these.
10265,I. MORNING,
10266,I. MORNING,_Gottlieb._ His discovery of the truth will be frightful.
10267,I. MORNING,
10268,I. MORNING,_4th Student._ That's the joke. But you should have
10269,I. MORNING,joined us at the beginning; there's no doubt he loves the          55
10270,I. MORNING,girl--loves a model he might hire by the hour!
10271,I. MORNING,
10272,I. MORNING,"_Gottlieb._ See here! ""He has been accustomed,"" he"
10273,I. MORNING,"writes, ""to have Canova's women about him, in stone,"
10274,I. MORNING,"and the world's women beside him, in flesh; these being"
10275,I. MORNING,"as much below, as those above, his soul's aspiration;              60"
10276,I. MORNING,"but now he is to have the reality."" There you laugh"
10277,I. MORNING,"again! I say, you wipe off the very dew of his youth."
10278,I. MORNING,
10279,I. MORNING,_1st Student._ Schramm! (Take the pipe out of his
10280,I. MORNING,"mouth, somebody!) Will Jules lose the bloom of his youth?          65"
10281,I. MORNING,
10282,I. MORNING,_Schramm._ Nothing worth keeping is ever lost in this
10283,I. MORNING,"world: look at a blossom--it drops presently, having done"
10284,I. MORNING,"its service and lasted its time; but fruits succeed, and"
10285,I. MORNING,where would be the blossom's place could it continue?
10286,I. MORNING,"As well affirm that your eye is no longer in your body,            70"
10287,I. MORNING,"because its earliest favorite, whatever it may have first"
10288,I. MORNING,"loved to look on, is dead and done with--as that any affection"
10289,I. MORNING,"is lost to the soul when its first object, whatever"
10290,I. MORNING,"happened first to satisfy it, is superseded in due course."
10291,I. MORNING,"Keep but ever looking, whether with the body's eye or the          75"
10292,I. MORNING,"mind's, and you will soon find something to look on! Has"
10293,I. MORNING,"a man done wondering at women?--there follow men,"
10294,I. MORNING,"dead and alive, to wonder at. Has he done wondering at"
10295,I. MORNING,men?--there's God to wonder at; and the faculty of wonder
10296,I. MORNING,"may be, at the same time, old and tired enough with                80"
10297,I. MORNING,"respect to its first object, and yet young and fresh sufficiently,"
10298,I. MORNING,so far as concerns its novel one. Thus--
10299,I. MORNING,
10300,I. MORNING,_1st Student._ Put Schramm's pipe into his mouth again!
10301,I. MORNING,"There you see! Well, this Jules--a wretched fribble"
10302,I. MORNING,"--oh, I watched his disportings at Possagno, the other             85"
10303,I. MORNING,day! Canova's gallery--you know: there he marches first
10304,I. MORNING,resolvedly past great works by the dozen without vouchsafing
10305,I. MORNING,an eye; all at once he stops full at the
10306,I. MORNING,_Psiche-fanciulla_--cannot
10307,I. MORNING,pass that old acquaintance without a
10308,I. MORNING,"nod of encouragement--""In your new place, beauty?                  90"
10309,I. MORNING,Then behave yourself as well here as at Munich--I see
10310,I. MORNING,"you!"" Next he posts himself deliberately before the unfinished"
10311,I. MORNING,"_Pietà_ for half an hour without moving, till up he"
10312,I. MORNING,"starts of a sudden, and thrusts his very nose into--I say,"
10313,I. MORNING,into--the group; by which gesture you are informed that            95
10314,I. MORNING,precisely the sole point he had not fully mastered in
10315,I. MORNING,Canova's practice was a certain method of using the drill
10316,I. MORNING,"in the articulation of the knee-joint--and that, likewise,"
10317,I. MORNING,"has he mastered at length! Good-by, therefore, to poor"
10318,I. MORNING,Canova--whose gallery no longer needs detain his successor        100
10319,I. MORNING,"Jules, the predestinated novel thinker in marble!"
10320,I. MORNING,
10321,I. MORNING,_5th Student._ Tell him about the women; go on to the
10322,I. MORNING,women!
10323,I. MORNING,
10324,I. MORNING,"_1st Student._ Why, on that matter he could never be"
10325,I. MORNING,supercilious enough. How should we be other (he said)             105
10326,I. MORNING,"than the poor devils you see, with those debasing habits we"
10327,I. MORNING,"cherish? He was not to wallow in that mire, at least;"
10328,I. MORNING,"he would wait, and love only at the proper time, and"
10329,I. MORNING,"meanwhile put up with the _Psiche-fanciulla_. Now, I"
10330,I. MORNING,happened to hear of a young Greek--real Greek girl at             110
10331,I. MORNING,"Malamocco; a true Islander, do you see, with Alciphron's"
10332,I. MORNING,"""hair like sea-moss""--Schramm knows!--white and quiet"
10333,I. MORNING,"as an apparition, and fourteen years old at farthest--a"
10334,I. MORNING,"daughter of Natalia, so she swears--that hag Natalia, who"
10335,I. MORNING,helps us to models at three _lire_ an hour. We selected           115
10336,I. MORNING,"this girl for the heroine of our jest. So first, Jules received"
10337,I. MORNING,a scented letter--somebody had seen his Tydeus at the
10338,I. MORNING,"Academy, and my picture was nothing to it: a profound"
10339,I. MORNING,admirer bade him persevere--would make herself known to him
10340,I. MORNING,"ere long. (Paolina, my little friend of the _Fenice_,             120"
10341,I. MORNING,"transcribes divinely.) And in due time, the mysterious"
10342,I. MORNING,correspondent gave certain hints of her peculiar charms--the

10344,I. MORNING,"struck us in our Malamocco model: we retained her name,"
10345,I. MORNING,"too--Phene, which is, by interpretation, sea-eagle. Now,          125"
10346,I. MORNING,think of Jules finding himself distinguished from the
10347,I. MORNING,herd of us by such a creature! In his very first answer
10348,I. MORNING,he proposed marrying his monitress: and fancy us over
10349,I. MORNING,"these letters, two, three times a day, to receive and"
10350,I. MORNING,dispatch! I concocted the main of it: relations were in           130
10351,I. MORNING,"the way--secrecy must be observed--in fine, would he"
10352,I. MORNING,"wed her on trust, and only speak to her when they were"
10353,I. MORNING,indissolubly united? St--st--Here they come!
10354,I. MORNING,
10355,I. MORNING,"_6th Student._ Both of them! Heaven's love, speak"
10356,I. MORNING,"softly, speak within yourselves!                                  135"
10357,I. MORNING,
10358,I. MORNING,_5th Student._ Look at the bridegroom! Half his hair
10359,I. MORNING,in storm and half in calm--patted down over the left
10360,I. MORNING,temple--like a frothy cup one blows on to cool it! and
10361,I. MORNING,the same old blouse that he murders the marble in!
10362,I. MORNING,
10363,I. MORNING,"_2nd Student._ Not a rich vest like yours, Hannibal               140"
10364,I. MORNING,"Scratchy!--rich, that your face may the better set it off."
10365,I. MORNING,
10366,I. MORNING,"_6th Student._ And the bride! Yes, sure enough, our"
10367,I. MORNING,Phene! Should you have known her in her clothes?
10368,I. MORNING,How magnificently pale!
10369,I. MORNING,
10370,I. MORNING,"_Gottlieb._ She does not also take it for earnest, I              145"
10371,I. MORNING,hope?
10372,I. MORNING,
10373,I. MORNING,"_1st Student._ Oh, Natalia's concern, that is! We settle"
10374,I. MORNING,with Natalia.
10375,I. MORNING,
10376,I. MORNING,_6th Student._ She does not speak--has evidently let
10377,I. MORNING,"out no word. The only thing is, will she equally remember         150"
10378,I. MORNING,"the rest of her lesson, and repeat correctly all those"
10379,I. MORNING,verses which are to break the secret to Jules?
10380,I. MORNING,
10381,I. MORNING,_Gottlieb._ How he gazes on her! Pity--pity!
10382,I. MORNING,
10383,I. MORNING,"_1st Student._ They go in; now, silence! You three--not"
10384,I. MORNING,"nearer the window, mind, than that pomegranate--just              155"
10385,I. MORNING,"where the little girl, who a few minutes ago passed"
10386,I. MORNING,"us singing, is seated!"

10390,II.--NOON,
10391,II.--NOON,"SCENE--_Over Orcana. The house of_ JULES, _who crosses its threshold"
10392,II.--NOON,"with_ PHENE: _she is silent, on which_ JULES _begins--_"
10393,II.--NOON,
10394,II.--NOON,"Do not die, Phene! I am yours now, you"
10395,II.--NOON,"Are mine now; let fate reach me how she likes,"
10396,II.--NOON,"If you'll not die: so, never die! Sit here--"
10397,II.--NOON,My workroom's single seat. I over-lean
10398,II.--NOON,This length of hair and lustrous front; they turn                   5
10399,II.--NOON,"Like an entire flower upward: eyes, lips, last"
10400,II.--NOON,"Your chin--no, last your throat turns: 'tis their scent"
10401,II.--NOON,"Pulls down my face upon you. Nay, look ever"
10402,II.--NOON,"This one way till I change, grow you--I could"
10403,II.--NOON,"Change into you, beloved!"
10404,II.--NOON,"You by me,                              10"
10405,II.--NOON,"And I by you; this is your hand in mine,"
10406,II.--NOON,And side by side we sit: all's true. Thank God!
10407,II.--NOON,I have spoken: speak you!
10408,II.--NOON,O my life to come!
10409,II.--NOON,My Tydeus must be carved that's there in clay;
10410,II.--NOON,"Yet how be carved, with you about the room?                        15"
10411,II.--NOON,Where must I place you? When I think that once
10412,II.--NOON,This roomfull of rough block-work seemed my heaven
10413,II.--NOON,"Without you! Shall I ever work again,"
10414,II.--NOON,"Get fairly into my old ways again,"
10415,II.--NOON,"Bid each conception stand while, trait by trait,                   20"
10416,II.--NOON,My hand transfers its lineaments to stone?
10417,II.--NOON,"Will my mere fancies live near you, their truth--"
10418,II.--NOON,"The live truth, passing and repassing me,"
10419,II.--NOON,Sitting beside me?
10420,II.--NOON,Now speak!
10421,II.--NOON,"Only first,"
10422,II.--NOON,"See, all your letters! Was't not well contrived?                   25"
10423,II.--NOON,Their hiding-place is Psyche's robe; she keeps
10424,II.--NOON,Your letters next her skin: which drops out foremost?
10425,II.--NOON,Ah--this that swam down like a first moonbeam
10426,II.--NOON,Into my world!
10427,II.--NOON,Again those eyes complete
10428,II.--NOON,"Their melancholy survey, sweet and slow,                           30"
10429,II.--NOON,Of beauty--to the human archetype.
10430,II.--NOON,"On me, with pity, yet some wonder too:"
10431,II.--NOON,"As if God bade some spirit plague a world,"
10432,II.--NOON,And this were the one moment of surprise
10433,II.--NOON,"And sorrow while she took her station, pausing                     35"
10434,II.--NOON,"O'er what she sees, finds good, and must destroy!"
10435,II.--NOON,"What gaze you at? Those? Books, I told you of;"
10436,II.--NOON,"Let your first word to me rejoice them, too:"
10437,II.--NOON,"This minion, a Coluthus, writ in red"
10438,II.--NOON,Bister and azure by Bessarion's scribe--                           40
10439,II.--NOON,"Read this line--no, shame--Homer's be the Greek"
10440,II.--NOON,First breathed me from the lips of my Greek girl!
10441,II.--NOON,This Odyssey in coarse black vivid type
10442,II.--NOON,"With faded yellow blossoms 'twixt page and page,"
10443,II.--NOON,To mark great places with due gratitude;                           45
10444,II.--NOON,"_""He said, and on Antinous directed_"
10445,II.--NOON,"_A bitter shaft""_--a flower blots out the rest!"
10446,II.--NOON,"Again upon your search? My statues, then!"
10447,II.--NOON,"--Ah, do not mind that--better that will look"
10448,II.--NOON,"When cast in bronze--an Almaign Kaiser, that,                      50"
10449,II.--NOON,"Swart-green and gold, with truncheon based on hip."
10450,II.--NOON,"This, rather, turn to! What, unrecognized?"
10451,II.--NOON,I thought you would have seen that here you sit
10452,II.--NOON,"As I imagined you--Hippolyta,"
10453,II.--NOON,Naked upon her bright Numidian horse.                              55
10454,II.--NOON,"Recall you this, then? ""Carve in bold relief""--"
10455,II.--NOON,"So you commanded--""carve, against I come,"
10456,II.--NOON,"A Greek, in Athens, as our fashion was,"
10457,II.--NOON,"Feasting, bay-filleted and thunder-free,"
10458,II.--NOON,Who rises 'neath the lifted myrtle-branch.                         60
10459,II.--NOON,"'Praise Those who slew Hipparchus!' cry the guests,"
10460,II.--NOON,'While o'er thy head the singer's myrtle waves
10461,II.--NOON,"As erst above our champion: stand up all!'"""
10462,II.--NOON,"See, I have labored to express your thought."
10463,II.--NOON,"Quite round, a cluster of mere hands and arms,                     65"
10464,II.--NOON,"(Thrust in all senses, all ways, from all sides,"
10465,II.--NOON,Only consenting at the branch's end
10466,II.--NOON,"They strain toward) serves for frame to a sole face,"
10467,II.--NOON,"The Praiser's, in the center: who with eyes"
10468,II.--NOON,"Sightless, so bend they back to light inside                       70"
10469,II.--NOON,"His brain where visionary forms throng up,"
10470,II.--NOON,"Sings, minding not that palpitating arch"
10471,II.--NOON,"Of hands and arms, nor the quick drip of wine"
10472,II.--NOON,"From the drenched leaves o'erhead, nor crowns cast off,"
10473,II.--NOON,Violet and parsley crowns to trample on--                          75
10474,II.--NOON,"Sings, pausing as the patron-ghosts approve,"
10475,II.--NOON,Devoutly their unconquerable hymn.
10476,II.--NOON,"But you must say a ""well"" to that--say ""well!"""
10477,II.--NOON,"Because you gaze--am I fantastic, sweet?"
10478,II.--NOON,"Gaze like my very life's-stuff, marble--marbly                     80"
10479,II.--NOON,"Even to the silence! Why, before I found"
10480,II.--NOON,"The real flesh Phene, I inured myself"
10481,II.--NOON,"To see, throughout all nature, varied stuff"
10482,II.--NOON,For better nature's birth by means of art:
10483,II.--NOON,"With me, each substance tended to one form                         85"
10484,II.--NOON,Of beauty--to the human archetype.
10485,II.--NOON,On every side occurred suggestive germs
10486,II.--NOON,"Of that--the tree, the flower--or take the fruit--"
10487,II.--NOON,"Some rosy shape, continuing the peach,"
10488,II.--NOON,"Curved beewise o'er its bough; as rosy limbs,                      90"
10489,II.--NOON,"Depending, nestled in the leaves; and just"
10490,II.--NOON,From a cleft rose-peach the whole Dryad sprang.
10491,II.--NOON,"But of the stuffs one can be master of,"
10492,II.--NOON,How I divined their capabilities!
10493,II.--NOON,From the soft-rinded smoothening facile chalk                      95
10494,II.--NOON,"That yields your outline to the air's embrace,"
10495,II.--NOON,Half-softened by a halo's pearly gloom;
10496,II.--NOON,"Down to the crisp imperious steel, so sure"
10497,II.--NOON,To cut its one confided thought clean out
10498,II.--NOON,Of all the world. But marble!--'neath my tools                    100
10499,II.--NOON,More pliable than jelly--as it were
10500,II.--NOON,Some clear primordial creature dug from depths
10501,II.--NOON,"In the earth's heart, where itself breeds itself,"
10502,II.--NOON,And whence all baser substance may be worked;
10503,II.--NOON,"Refine it off to air, you may--condense it                        105"
10504,II.--NOON,"Down to the diamond--is not metal there,"
10505,II.--NOON,When o'er the sudden speck my chisel trips?
10506,II.--NOON,"--Not flesh, as flake off flake I scale, approach,"
10507,II.--NOON,Lay bare those bluish veins of blood asleep?
10508,II.--NOON,"Lurks flame in no strange windings where, surprised               110"
10509,II.--NOON,"By the swift implement sent home at once,"
10510,II.--NOON,Flushes and glowings radiate and hover
10511,II.--NOON,About its track?
10512,II.--NOON,Phene? what--why is this?
10513,II.--NOON,"That whitening cheek, those still dilating eyes!"
10514,II.--NOON,"Ah, you will die--I knew that you would die!                      115"
10515,II.--NOON,
10516,II.--NOON,"PHENE _begins, on his having long remained silent._"
10517,II.--NOON,
10518,II.--NOON,"Now the end's coming; to be sure, it must"
10519,II.--NOON,"Have ended sometime! Tush, why need I speak"
10520,II.--NOON,Their foolish speech? I cannot bring to mind
10521,II.--NOON,"One half of it, beside; and do not care"
10522,II.--NOON,"For old Natalia now, nor any of them.                             120"
10523,II.--NOON,"Oh, you--what are you?--if I do not try"
10524,II.--NOON,To say the words Natalia made me learn;
10525,II.--NOON,To please your friends--it is to keep myself
10526,II.--NOON,"Where your voice lifted me, by letting that"
10527,II.--NOON,"Proceed; but can it? Even you, perhaps,                           125"
10528,II.--NOON,"Cannot take up, now you have once let fall,"
10529,II.--NOON,"The music's life, and me along with that--"
10530,II.--NOON,"No, or you would! We'll stay, then, as we are--"
10531,II.--NOON,Above the world.
10532,II.--NOON,You creature with the eyes!
10533,II.--NOON,"If I could look forever up to them,                               130"
10534,II.--NOON,"As now you let me--I believe all sin,"
10535,II.--NOON,"All memory of wrong done, suffering borne,"
10536,II.--NOON,"Would drop down, low and lower, to the earth"
10537,II.--NOON,"Whence all that's low comes, and there touch and stay"
10538,II.--NOON,"--Never to overtake the rest of me,                               135"
10539,II.--NOON,"All that, unspotted, reaches up to you,"
10540,II.--NOON,"Drawn by those eyes! What rises is myself,"
10541,II.--NOON,"Not me the shame and suffering; but they sink,"
10542,II.--NOON,"Are left, I rise above them. Keep me so,"
10543,II.--NOON,Above the world!                                                  140
10544,II.--NOON,"But you sink, for your eyes"
10545,II.--NOON,"Are altering--altered! Stay--""I love you, love""--"
10546,II.--NOON,I could prevent it if I understood:
10547,II.--NOON,More of your words to me; was 't in the tone
10548,II.--NOON,"Or the words, your power?"
10549,II.--NOON,Or stay--I will repeat
10550,II.--NOON,"Their speech, if that contents you! Only change                   145"
10551,II.--NOON,"No more, and I shall find it presently"
10552,II.--NOON,"Far back here, in the brain yourself filled up."
10553,II.--NOON,Natalia threatened me that harm should follow
10554,II.--NOON,"Unless I spoke their lesson to the end,"
10555,II.--NOON,"But harm to me, I thought she meant, not you.                     150"
10556,II.--NOON,Your friends--Natalia said they were your friends
10557,II.--NOON,"And meant you well--because, I doubted it,"
10558,II.--NOON,Observing (what was very strange to see)
10559,II.--NOON,"On every face, so different in all else,"
10560,II.--NOON,"The same smile girls like me are used to bear,                    155"
10561,II.--NOON,"But never men, men cannot stoop so low;"
10562,II.--NOON,"Yet your friends, speaking of you, used that smile,"
10563,II.--NOON,That hateful smirk of boundless self-conceit
10564,II.--NOON,Which seems to take possession of the world
10565,II.--NOON,"And make of God a tame confederate,                               160"
10566,II.--NOON,Purveyor to their appetites--you know!
10567,II.--NOON,"But still Natalia said they were your friends,"
10568,II.--NOON,"And they assented though they smiled the more,"
10569,II.--NOON,And all came round me--that thin Englishman
10570,II.--NOON,With light lank hair seemed leader of the rest;                   165
10571,II.--NOON,"He held a paper--""What we want,"" said he,"
10572,II.--NOON,"Ending some explanation to his friends,"
10573,II.--NOON,"""Is something slow, involved, and mystical,"
10574,II.--NOON,"To hold Jules long in doubt, yet take his taste"
10575,II.--NOON,"And lure him on until, at innermost                               170"
10576,II.--NOON,"Where he seeks sweetness' soul, he may find--this!"
10577,II.--NOON,"--As in the apple's core, the noisome fly;"
10578,II.--NOON,"For insects on the rind are seen at once,"
10579,II.--NOON,"And brushed aside as soon, but this is found"
10580,II.--NOON,"Only when on the lips or loathing tongue.""                        175"
10581,II.--NOON,And so he read what I have got by heart:
10582,II.--NOON,"I'll speak it--""Do not die, love! I am yours""--"
10583,II.--NOON,"No--is not that, or like that, part of words"
10584,II.--NOON,Yourself began by speaking? Strange to lose
10585,II.--NOON,What cost such pains to learn! Is this more right?                180
10586,II.--NOON,
10587,II.--NOON,_I am a painter who cannot paint;_
10588,II.--NOON,"_In my life, a devil rather than saint;_"
10589,II.--NOON,"_In my brain, as poor a creature too:_"
10590,II.--NOON,_No end to all I cannot do!_
10591,II.--NOON,_Yet do one thing at least I can--_                       185
10592,II.--NOON,_Love a man or hate a man_
10593,II.--NOON,_Supremely: thus my lore began._
10594,II.--NOON,"_Through the Valley of Love I went,_"
10595,II.--NOON,"_In the lovingest spot to abide,_"
10596,II.--NOON,"_And just on the verge where I pitched my tent,_          190"
10597,II.--NOON,_I found Hate dwelling beside._
10598,II.--NOON,"_(Let the Bridegroom ask what the painter meant,_"
10599,II.--NOON,"_Of his Bride, of the peerless Bride!)_"
10600,II.--NOON,"_And further, I traversed Hate's grove,_"
10601,II.--NOON,_In the hatefullest nook to dwell;_                       195
10602,II.--NOON,"_But lo, where I flung myself prone, couched Love_"
10603,II.--NOON,_Where the shadow threefold fell._
10604,II.--NOON,"_(The meaning--those black bride's-eyes above,_"
10605,II.--NOON,_Not a painter's lip should tell!)_
10606,II.--NOON,
10607,II.--NOON,"""And here,"" said he, ""Jules probably will ask,                    200"
10608,II.--NOON,"'You have black eyes, Love--you are, sure enough,"
10609,II.--NOON,My peerless bride--then do you tell indeed
10610,II.--NOON,"What needs some explanation! What means this?'"""
10611,II.--NOON,"--And I am to go on, without a word--"
10612,II.--NOON,
10613,II.--NOON,"_So I grew wise in Love and Hate,_                        205"
10614,II.--NOON,_From simple that I was of late._
10615,II.--NOON,"_Once when I loved, I would enlace_"
10616,II.--NOON,"_Breast, eyelids, hands, feet, form, and face_"
10617,II.--NOON,"_Of her I loved, in one embrace--_"
10618,II.--NOON,_As if by mere love I could love immensely!_              210
10619,II.--NOON,"_Once, when I hated, I would plunge_"
10620,II.--NOON,"_My sword, and wipe with the first lunge_"
10621,II.--NOON,_My foe's whole life out like a sponge--_
10622,II.--NOON,_As if by mere hate I could hate intensely!_
10623,II.--NOON,"_But now I am wiser, know better the fashion_             215"
10624,II.--NOON,_How passion seeks aid from its opposite passion;_
10625,II.--NOON,"_And if I see cause to love more, hate more_"
10626,II.--NOON,"_Than ever man loved, ever hated before--_"
10627,II.--NOON,"_And seek in the Valley of Love,_"
10628,II.--NOON,"_The nest, or the nook in Hate's Grove,_                  220"
10629,II.--NOON,_Where my soul may surely reach_
10630,II.--NOON,"_The essence, naught less, of each,_"
10631,II.--NOON,"_The Hate of all Hates, the Love_"
10632,II.--NOON,"_Of all Loves, in the Valley or Grove--_"
10633,II.--NOON,_I find them the very warders_                            225
10634,II.--NOON,_Each of the other's borders._
10635,II.--NOON,"_When I love most, Love is disguised_"
10636,II.--NOON,_In Hate; and when Hate is surprised_

10929,III.--EVENING,To this wild enterprise. Say you are right--                       60
10930,III.--EVENING,How should one in your state e'er bring to pass
10931,III.--EVENING,"What would require a cool head, a cold heart,"
10932,III.--EVENING,And a calm hand? You never will escape.
10933,III.--EVENING,
10934,III.--EVENING,_Luigi._ Escape? To even wish that would spoil all.
10935,III.--EVENING,The dying is best part of it. Too much                             65
10936,III.--EVENING,"Have I enjoyed these fifteen years of mine,"
10937,III.--EVENING,To leave myself excuse for longer life:
10938,III.--EVENING,"Was not life pressed down, running o'er with joy,"
10939,III.--EVENING,That I might finish with it ere my fellows
10940,III.--EVENING,"Who, sparelier feasted, make a longer stay?                        70"
10941,III.--EVENING,"I was put at the board-head, helped to all"
10942,III.--EVENING,At first; I rise up happy and content.
10943,III.--EVENING,God must be glad one loves his world so much.
10944,III.--EVENING,I can give news of earth to all the dead
10945,III.--EVENING,"Who ask me:--last year's sunsets, and great stars                  75"
10946,III.--EVENING,Which had a right to come first and see ebb
10947,III.--EVENING,The crimson wave that drifts the sun away--
10948,III.--EVENING,Those crescent moons with notched and burning rims
10949,III.--EVENING,"That strengthened into sharp fire, and there stood,"
10950,III.--EVENING,Impatient of the azure--and that day                               80
10951,III.--EVENING,"In March, a double rainbow stopped the storm--"
10952,III.--EVENING,"May's warm, slow, yellow moonlit summer nights--"
10953,III.--EVENING,"Gone are they, but I have them in my soul!"
10954,III.--EVENING,
10955,III.--EVENING,_Mother._ (He will not go!)
10956,III.--EVENING,
10957,III.--EVENING,_Luigi._                         You smile at me? 'Tis true--
10958,III.--EVENING,"Voluptuousness, grotesqueness, ghastliness,                        85"
10959,III.--EVENING,Environ my devotedness as quaintly
10960,III.--EVENING,As round about some antique altar wreathe
10961,III.--EVENING,"The rose festoons, goats' horns, and oxen's skulls."
10962,III.--EVENING,
10963,III.--EVENING,"_Mother._ See now: you reach the city, you must cross"
10964,III.--EVENING,His threshold--how?
10965,III.--EVENING,
10966,III.--EVENING,"_Luigi._             Oh, that's if we conspired!                   90"
10967,III.--EVENING,"Then would come pains in plenty, as you guess--"
10968,III.--EVENING,But guess not how the qualities most fit
10969,III.--EVENING,"For such an office, qualities I have,"
10970,III.--EVENING,"Would little stead me, otherwise employed,"
10971,III.--EVENING,Yet prove of rarest merit only here.                               95
10972,III.--EVENING,Everyone knows for what his excellence
10973,III.--EVENING,"Will serve, but no one ever will consider"
10974,III.--EVENING,For what his worst defect might serve; and yet
10975,III.--EVENING,Have you not seen me range our coppice yonder
10976,III.--EVENING,In search of a distorted ash?--I find                             100
10977,III.--EVENING,The wry spoilt branch a natural perfect bow.
10978,III.--EVENING,"Fancy the thrice-sage, thrice-precautioned man"
10979,III.--EVENING,Arriving at the palace on my errand!
10980,III.--EVENING,"No, no! I have a handsome dress packed up--"
10981,III.--EVENING,"White satin here, to set off my black hair;                       105"
10982,III.--EVENING,In I shall march--for you may watch your life out
10983,III.--EVENING,"Behind thick walls, make friends there to betray you;"
10984,III.--EVENING,More than one man spoils everything. March straight--
10985,III.--EVENING,"Only, no clumsy knife to fumble for."
10986,III.--EVENING,"Take the great gate, and walk (not saunter) on                    110"
10987,III.--EVENING,Through guards and guards--I have rehearsed it all
10988,III.--EVENING,Inside the turret here a hundred times
10989,III.--EVENING,"Don't ask the way of whom you meet, observe!"
10990,III.--EVENING,But where they cluster thickliest is the door
10991,III.--EVENING,Of doors; they'll let you pass--they'll never blab                115
10992,III.--EVENING,"Each to the other, he knows not the favorite,"
10993,III.--EVENING,Whence he is bound and what's his business now.
10994,III.--EVENING,Walk in--straight up to him; you have no knife:
10995,III.--EVENING,"Be prompt, how should he scream? Then, out with you!"
10996,III.--EVENING,"Italy, Italy, my Italy!                                           120"
10997,III.--EVENING,"You're free, you're free! Oh, mother, I could dream"
10998,III.--EVENING,"They got about me--Andrea from his exile,"
10999,III.--EVENING,"Pier from his dungeon, Gualtier from his grave!"
11000,III.--EVENING,
11001,III.--EVENING,"_Mother._ Well, you shall go. Yet seems this patriotism"
11002,III.--EVENING,The easiest virtue for a selfish man                              125
11003,III.--EVENING,"To acquire: he loves himself--and next, the world--"
11004,III.--EVENING,If he must love beyond--but naught between:
11005,III.--EVENING,As a short-sighted man sees naught midway
11006,III.--EVENING,His body and the sun above. But you
11007,III.--EVENING,"Are my adored Luigi, ever obedient                                130"
11008,III.--EVENING,"To my least wish, and running o'er with love;"
11009,III.--EVENING,I could not call you cruel or unkind.
11010,III.--EVENING,"Once more, your ground for killing him!--then go!"
11011,III.--EVENING,
11012,III.--EVENING,"_Luigi._ Now do you try me, or make sport of me?"
11013,III.--EVENING,How first the Austrians got these provinces--                     135
11014,III.--EVENING,"(If that is all, I'll satisfy you soon)"
11015,III.--EVENING,"--Never by conquest but by cunning, for"
11016,III.--EVENING,That treaty whereby--
11017,III.--EVENING,
11018,III.--EVENING,_Mother._              Well?
11019,III.--EVENING,
11020,III.--EVENING,"_Luigi._                      (Sure, he's arrived,"
11021,III.--EVENING,"The telltale cuckoo; spring's his confidant,"
11022,III.--EVENING,And he lets out her April purposes!)                              140
11023,III.--EVENING,"Or--better go at once to modern time,"
11024,III.--EVENING,"He has--they have--in fact, I understand"
11025,III.--EVENING,But can't restate the matter; that's my boast:
11026,III.--EVENING,"Others could reason it out to you, and prove"
11027,III.--EVENING,Things they have made me feel.
11028,III.--EVENING,
11029,III.--EVENING,_Mother._                       Why go tonight?                   145
11030,III.--EVENING,Morn's for adventure. Jupiter is now
11031,III.--EVENING,"A morning-star. I cannot hear you, Luigi!"
11032,III.--EVENING,
11033,III.--EVENING,"_Luigi._ ""I am the bright and morning-star,"" saith God--"
11034,III.--EVENING,"And, ""to such an one I give the morning-star."""
11035,III.--EVENING,The gift of the morning-star! Have I God's gift                   150
11036,III.--EVENING,Of the morning-star?
11037,III.--EVENING,
11038,III.--EVENING,_Mother._            Chiara will love to see
11039,III.--EVENING,That Jupiter an evening-star next June.
11040,III.--EVENING,
11041,III.--EVENING,"_Luigi._ True, mother. Well for those who live through June!"
11042,III.--EVENING,"Great noontides, thunder-storms, all glaring pomps"
11043,III.--EVENING,That triumph at the heels of June the god                         155
11044,III.--EVENING,Leading his revel through our leafy world.
11045,III.--EVENING,"Yes, Chiara will be here."
11046,III.--EVENING,
11047,III.--EVENING,"_Mother._                 In June: remember,"
11048,III.--EVENING,Yourself appointed that month for her coming.
11049,III.--EVENING,
11050,III.--EVENING,_Luigi._ Was that low noise the echo?
11051,III.--EVENING,
11052,III.--EVENING,_Mother._                              The night-wind.
11053,III.--EVENING,She must be grown--with her blue eyes upturned                    160
11054,III.--EVENING,As if life were one long and sweet surprise:
11055,III.--EVENING,In June she comes.
11056,III.--EVENING,
11057,III.--EVENING,_Luigi._            We were to see together
11058,III.--EVENING,"The Titian at Treviso. There, again!"
11059,III.--EVENING,
11060,III.--EVENING,"[_From without is heard the voice of_ PIPPA, _singing_--"
11061,III.--EVENING,
11062,III.--EVENING,"_A king lived long ago,_"
11063,III.--EVENING,"_In the morning of the world,_                            165"
11064,III.--EVENING,_When earth was nigher heaven than now._
11065,III.--EVENING,"_And the king's locks curled,_"
11066,III.--EVENING,_Disparting o'er a forehead full_
11067,III.--EVENING,_As the milk-white space 'twixt horn and horn_
11068,III.--EVENING,_Of some sacrificial bull--_                              170
11069,III.--EVENING,_Only calm as a babe new-born:_
11070,III.--EVENING,"_For he was got to a sleepy mood,_"
11071,III.--EVENING,"_So safe from all decrepitude,_"
11072,III.--EVENING,"_Age with its bane, so sure gone by,_"
11073,III.--EVENING,_(The gods so loved him while he dreamed)_                175
11074,III.--EVENING,"_That, having lived thus long, there seemed_"
11075,III.--EVENING,_No need the king should ever die._
11076,III.--EVENING,
11077,III.--EVENING,_Luigi._ No need that sort of king should ever die!
11078,III.--EVENING,
11079,III.--EVENING,_Among the rocks his city was:_
11080,III.--EVENING,"_Before his palace, in the sun,_                          180"
11081,III.--EVENING,"_He sat to see his people pass,_"
11082,III.--EVENING,_And judge them every one_
11083,III.--EVENING,_From its threshold of smooth stone._
11084,III.--EVENING,_They haled him many a valley-thief_
11085,III.--EVENING,"_Caught in the sheep-pens, robber-chief_                  185"
11086,III.--EVENING,"_Swarthy and shameless, beggar-cheat,_"
11087,III.--EVENING,"_Spy-prowler, or rough pirate found_"
11088,III.--EVENING,_On the sea-sand left aground;_
11089,III.--EVENING,"_And sometimes clung about his feet,_"
11090,III.--EVENING,"_With bleeding lid and burning cheek,_                    190"
11091,III.--EVENING,"_A woman, bitterest wrong to speak_"
11092,III.--EVENING,_Of one with sullen thickset brows:_
11093,III.--EVENING,_And sometimes from the prison-house_
11094,III.--EVENING,"_The angry priests a pale wretch brought,_"
11095,III.--EVENING,_Who through some chink had pushed and pressed_           195
11096,III.--EVENING,"_On knees and elbows, belly and breast,_"
11097,III.--EVENING,_Worm-like into the temple--caught_
11098,III.--EVENING,"_He was by the very god,_"
11099,III.--EVENING,_Whoever in the darkness strode_
11100,III.--EVENING,"_Backward and forward, keeping watch_                     200"
11101,III.--EVENING,"_O'er his brazen bowls, such rogues to catch!_"
11102,III.--EVENING,"_These, all and everyone,_"
11103,III.--EVENING,"_The king judged, sitting in the sun._"
11104,III.--EVENING,
11105,III.--EVENING,_Luigi._ That king should still judge sitting in the sun!
11106,III.--EVENING,
11107,III.--EVENING,"_His councilors, on left and right,_                      205"
11108,III.--EVENING,_Looked anxious up--but no surprise_
11109,III.--EVENING,"_Disturbed the king's old smiling eyes,_"
11110,III.--EVENING,_Where the very blue had turned to white._
11111,III.--EVENING,"_'Tis said, a Python scared one day_"
11112,III.--EVENING,"_The breathless city, till he came,_                      210"
11113,III.--EVENING,"_With forky tongue and eyes on flame,_"
11114,III.--EVENING,_Where the old king sat to judge alway;_
11115,III.--EVENING,_But when he saw the sweepy hair_
11116,III.--EVENING,_Girt with a crown of berries rare_
11117,III.--EVENING,_Which the god will hardly give to wear_                  215
11118,III.--EVENING,"_To the maiden who singeth, dancing bare_"
11119,III.--EVENING,"_In the altar-smoke by the pine-torch lights,_"
11120,III.--EVENING,_At his wondrous forest rites--_
11121,III.--EVENING,"_Seeing this, he did not dare_"
11122,III.--EVENING,"_Approach that threshold in the sun,_                     220"
11123,III.--EVENING,_Assault the old king smiling there._
11124,III.--EVENING,_Such grace had kings when the world begun!_
11125,III.--EVENING,
11126,III.--EVENING,[PIPPA _passes_.
11127,III.--EVENING,
11128,III.--EVENING,"_Luigi._ And such grace have they, now that the world ends!"
11129,III.--EVENING,"The Python at the city, on the throne,"
11130,III.--EVENING,"And brave men, God would crown for slaying him,                   225"
11131,III.--EVENING,Lurk in by-corners lest they fall his prey.
11132,III.--EVENING,"Are crowns yet to be won in this late time,"
11133,III.--EVENING,Which weakness makes me hesitate to reach?
11134,III.--EVENING,Tis God's voice calls; how could I stay? Farewell!
11135,III.--EVENING,
11136,III.--EVENING,"_Talk by the way, while_ PIPPA _is passing from the Turret to the"
11137,III.--EVENING,"Bishop's Brother's House, close to the Duomo S. Maria. Poor_ Girls"
11138,III.--EVENING,_sitting on the steps._
11139,III.--EVENING,
11140,III.--EVENING,_1st Girl._ There goes a swallow to Venice--the stout seafarer!
11141,III.--EVENING,Seeing those birds fly makes one wish for wings.
11142,III.--EVENING,Let us all wish; you wish first!
11143,III.--EVENING,
11144,III.--EVENING,_2nd Girl._                       I? This sunset
11145,III.--EVENING,To finish.
11146,III.--EVENING,
11147,III.--EVENING,"_3rd Girl._ That old--somebody I know,"
11148,III.--EVENING,"Grayer and older than my grandfather,                               5"
11149,III.--EVENING,To give me the same treat he gave last week--
11150,III.--EVENING,"Feeding me on his knee with fig-peckers,"
11151,III.--EVENING,"Lampreys and red Breganze-wine, and mumbling"
11152,III.--EVENING,"The while some folly about how well I fare,"
11153,III.--EVENING,Let sit and eat my supper quietly:                                 10
11154,III.--EVENING,"Since had he not himself been late this morning,"
11155,III.--EVENING,Detained at--never mind where--had he not--
11156,III.--EVENING,"""Eh, baggage, had I not!""--"
11157,III.--EVENING,
11158,III.--EVENING,_2nd Girl._                  How she can lie!
11159,III.--EVENING,
11160,III.--EVENING,_3rd Girl._ Look there--by the nails!
11161,III.--EVENING,
11162,III.--EVENING,_2nd Girl._                  What makes your fingers red?
11163,III.--EVENING,
11164,III.--EVENING,_3rd Girl._ Dipping them into wine to write bad words with         15
11165,III.--EVENING,On the bright table: how he laughed!
11166,III.--EVENING,
11167,III.--EVENING,_1st Girl._                           My turn.
11168,III.--EVENING,Spring's come and summer's coming. I would wear
11169,III.--EVENING,"A long loose gown, down to the feet and hands,"
11170,III.--EVENING,"With plaits here, close about the throat, all day;"
11171,III.--EVENING,"And all night lie, the cool long nights, in bed;                   20"
11172,III.--EVENING,"And have new milk to drink, apples to eat,"
11173,III.--EVENING,"Deuzans and junetings, leather-coats--ah, I should say,"
11174,III.--EVENING,This is away in the fields--miles!
11175,III.--EVENING,
11176,III.--EVENING,_3rd Girl._                         Say at once
11177,III.--EVENING,You'd be at home--she'd always be at home!
11178,III.--EVENING,Now comes the story of the farm among                              25
11179,III.--EVENING,"The cherry orchards, and how April snowed"
11180,III.--EVENING,"White blossoms on her as she ran. Why, fool,"
11181,III.--EVENING,"They've rubbed the chalk-mark out, how tall you were,"
11182,III.--EVENING,"Twisted your starling's neck, broken his cage,"
11183,III.--EVENING,Made a dunghill of your garden!
11184,III.--EVENING,
11185,III.--EVENING,_1st Girl._                      They destroy                      30
11186,III.--EVENING,My garden since I left them? Well--perhaps
11187,III.--EVENING,I would have done so--so I hope they have!
11188,III.--EVENING,A fig-tree curled out of our cottage wall;
11189,III.--EVENING,"They called it mine, I have forgotten why,"
11190,III.--EVENING,It must have been there long ere I was born:                       35
11191,III.--EVENING,_Cric_--_cric_--I think I hear the wasps o'erhead
11192,III.--EVENING,Pricking the papers strung to flutter there
11193,III.--EVENING,"And keep off birds in fruit-time--coarse long papers,"
11194,III.--EVENING,"And the wasps eat them, prick them through and through."
11195,III.--EVENING,
11196,III.--EVENING,_3rd Girl._ How her mouth twitches! Where was I?--before           40
11197,III.--EVENING,She broke in with her wishes and long gowns
11198,III.--EVENING,"And wasps--would I be such a fool!--Oh, here!"
11199,III.--EVENING,This is my way: I answer everyone
11200,III.--EVENING,Who asks me why I make so much of him--
11201,III.--EVENING,"(If you say, ""you love him""--straight ""he'll not be gulled!"")      45"
11202,III.--EVENING,"""He that seduced me when I was a girl"
11203,III.--EVENING,"Thus high--had eyes like yours, or hair like yours,"
11204,III.--EVENING,"Brown, red, white""--as the case may be; that pleases!"
11205,III.--EVENING,See how that beetle burnishes in the path!
11206,III.--EVENING,"There sparkles he along the dust; and, there--                     50"
11207,III.--EVENING,Your journey to that maize-tuft spoiled at least!
11208,III.--EVENING,
11209,III.--EVENING,"_1st Girl._ When I was young, they said if you killed one"
11210,III.--EVENING,"Of those sunshiny beetles, that his friend"
11211,III.--EVENING,Up there would shine no more that day nor next.
11212,III.--EVENING,
11213,III.--EVENING,"_2nd Girl._ When you were young? Nor are you young, that's true.   55"
11214,III.--EVENING,"How your plump arms, that were, have dropped away!"
11215,III.--EVENING,"Why, I can span them. Cecco beats you still?"

11268,IV.--NIGHT,Attendants.
11269,IV.--NIGHT,
11270,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ Thanks, friends, many thanks! I chiefly"
11271,IV.--NIGHT,"desire life now, that I may recompense every one of you."
11272,IV.--NIGHT,"Most I know something of already. What, a repast prepared?"
11273,IV.--NIGHT,"_Benedicto benedicatur_--ugh, ugh! Where was"
11274,IV.--NIGHT,"I? Oh, as you were remarking, Ugo, the weather is                   5"
11275,IV.--NIGHT,"mild, very unlike winter weather; but I am a Sicilian, you"
11276,IV.--NIGHT,"know, and shiver in your Julys here. To be sure, when"
11277,IV.--NIGHT,"'twas full summer at Messina, as we priests used to cross"
11278,IV.--NIGHT,"in procession the great square on Assumption Day, you"
11279,IV.--NIGHT,might see our thickest yellow tapers twist suddenly in             10
11280,IV.--NIGHT,"two, each like a falling star, or sink down on themselves"
11281,IV.--NIGHT,"in a gore of wax. But go, my friends, but go! [_To the_"
11282,IV.--NIGHT,"Intendant.] Not you, Ugo! [_The others leave the apartment._]"
11283,IV.--NIGHT,"I have long wanted to converse with you, Ugo."
11284,IV.--NIGHT,
11285,IV.--NIGHT,_Intendant._ Uguccio--                                             15
11286,IV.--NIGHT,
11287,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ ... 'guccio Stefani, man! of Ascoli,"
11288,IV.--NIGHT,Fermo and Fossombruno--what I do need instructing
11289,IV.--NIGHT,about are these accounts of your administration of my
11290,IV.--NIGHT,poor brother's affairs. Ugh! I shall never get through a
11291,IV.--NIGHT,third part of your accounts; take some of these dainties           20
11292,IV.--NIGHT,"before we attempt it, however. Are you bashful to that"
11293,IV.--NIGHT,"degree? For me, a crust and water suffice."
11294,IV.--NIGHT,
11295,IV.--NIGHT,_Intendant._ Do you choose this especial night to question
11296,IV.--NIGHT,me?
11297,IV.--NIGHT,
11298,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ This night, Ugo. You have managed my                  25"
11299,IV.--NIGHT,late brother's affairs since the death of our elder brother
11300,IV.--NIGHT,"--fourteen years and a month, all but three days. On"
11301,IV.--NIGHT,"the Third of December, I find him--"
11302,IV.--NIGHT,
11303,IV.--NIGHT,_Intendant._ If you have so intimate an acquaintance
11304,IV.--NIGHT,"with your brother's affairs, you will be tender of turning         30"
11305,IV.--NIGHT,"so far back: they will hardly bear looking into, so far back."
11306,IV.--NIGHT,
11307,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ Aye, aye, ugh, ugh--nothing but disappointments"
11308,IV.--NIGHT,here below! I remark a considerable payment
11309,IV.--NIGHT,made to yourself on this Third of December. Talk
11310,IV.--NIGHT,"of disappointments! There was a young fellow here,                 35"
11311,IV.--NIGHT,"Jules, a foreign sculptor I did my utmost to advance, that"
11312,IV.--NIGHT,the Church might be a gainer by us both; he was going
11313,IV.--NIGHT,"on hopefully enough, and of a sudden he notifies to me"
11314,IV.--NIGHT,some marvelous change that has happened in his notions
11315,IV.--NIGHT,"of Art. Here's his letter: ""He never had a clearly conceived       40"
11316,IV.--NIGHT,Ideal within his brain till today. Yet since his hand
11317,IV.--NIGHT,"could manage a chisel, he has practiced expressing other"
11318,IV.--NIGHT,"men's Ideals; and, in the very perfection he has attained"
11319,IV.--NIGHT,"to, he foresees an ultimate failure: his unconscious hand"
11320,IV.--NIGHT,"will pursue its prescribed course of old years, and will           45"
11321,IV.--NIGHT,reproduce
11322,IV.--NIGHT,"with a fatal expertness the ancient types, let the"
11323,IV.--NIGHT,novel one appear never so palpably to his spirit. There
11324,IV.--NIGHT,is but one method of escape: confiding the virgin type to
11325,IV.--NIGHT,"as chaste a hand, he will turn painter instead of sculptor,"
11326,IV.--NIGHT,"and paint, not carve, its characteristics""--strike out, I          50"
11327,IV.--NIGHT,"dare say, a school like Correggio: how think you, Ugo?"
11328,IV.--NIGHT,
11329,IV.--NIGHT,_Intendant._ Is Correggio a painter?
11330,IV.--NIGHT,
11331,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ Foolish Jules! and yet, after all, why"
11332,IV.--NIGHT,foolish? He may--probably will--fail egregiously; but
11333,IV.--NIGHT,"if there should arise a new painter, will it not be in some        55"
11334,IV.--NIGHT,"such way, by a poet now, or a musician (spirits who have"
11335,IV.--NIGHT,conceived and perfected an Ideal through some other
11336,IV.--NIGHT,"channel), transferring it to this, and escaping our conventional"
11337,IV.--NIGHT,"roads by pure ignorance of them; eh, Ugo? If"
11338,IV.--NIGHT,"you have no appetite, talk at least, Ugo!                          60"
11339,IV.--NIGHT,
11340,IV.--NIGHT,"_Intendant._ Sir, I can submit no longer to this course"
11341,IV.--NIGHT,"of yours. First, you select the group of which I formed"
11342,IV.--NIGHT,one--next you thin it gradually--always retaining me
11343,IV.--NIGHT,with your smile--and so do you proceed till you have
11344,IV.--NIGHT,fairly got me alone with you between four stone walls.             65
11345,IV.--NIGHT,"And now then? Let this farce, this chatter, end now;"
11346,IV.--NIGHT,what is it you want with me?
11347,IV.--NIGHT,
11348,IV.--NIGHT,_Monsignor._ Ugo!
11349,IV.--NIGHT,
11350,IV.--NIGHT,"_Intendant._ From the instant you arrived, I felt your"
11351,IV.--NIGHT,smile on me as you questioned me about this and the                70
11352,IV.--NIGHT,other article in those papers--why your brother should
11353,IV.--NIGHT,"have given me this villa, that _podere_--and your nod at"
11354,IV.--NIGHT,the end meant--what?
11355,IV.--NIGHT,
11356,IV.--NIGHT,_Monsignor._ Possibly that I wished for no loud talk
11357,IV.--NIGHT,"here. If once you set me coughing, Ugo!--                          75"
11358,IV.--NIGHT,
11359,IV.--NIGHT,_Intendant._ I have your brother's hand and seal to all I
11360,IV.--NIGHT,possess: now ask me what for! what service I did him--ask me!
11361,IV.--NIGHT,
11362,IV.--NIGHT,_Monsignor._ I would better not: I should rip up old
11363,IV.--NIGHT,"disgraces, let out my poor brother's weaknesses. By the            80"
11364,IV.--NIGHT,"way, Maffeo of Forli (which, I forgot to observe, is"
11365,IV.--NIGHT,"your true name), was the interdict ever taken off you,"
11366,IV.--NIGHT,for robbing that church at Cesena?
11367,IV.--NIGHT,
11368,IV.--NIGHT,"_Intendant._ No, nor needs be; for when I murdered"
11369,IV.--NIGHT,"your brother's friend, Pasquale, for him--                         85"
11370,IV.--NIGHT,
11371,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ Ah, he employed you in that business,"
11372,IV.--NIGHT,"did he? Well, I must let you keep, as you say, this villa"
11373,IV.--NIGHT,"and that _podere_, for fear the world should find out my"
11374,IV.--NIGHT,"relations were of so indifferent a stamp? Maffeo, my family"
11375,IV.--NIGHT,"is the oldest in Messina, and century after century                90"
11376,IV.--NIGHT,have my progenitors gone on polluting themselves with
11377,IV.--NIGHT,every wickedness under heaven: my own father--rest his
11378,IV.--NIGHT,"soul!--I have, I know, a chapel to support that it may"
11379,IV.--NIGHT,rest; my dear two dead brothers were--what you know
11380,IV.--NIGHT,"tolerably well; I, the youngest, might have rivaled them           95"
11381,IV.--NIGHT,"in vice, if not in wealth: but from my boyhood I came"
11382,IV.--NIGHT,"out from among them, and so am not partaker of their"
11383,IV.--NIGHT,plagues. My glory springs from another source; or if
11384,IV.--NIGHT,"from this, by contrast only--for I, the bishop, am the"
11385,IV.--NIGHT,"brother of your employers, Ugo. I hope to repair some             100"
11386,IV.--NIGHT,"of their wrong, however; so far as my brother's ill-gotten"
11387,IV.--NIGHT,"treasure reverts to me, I can stop the consequences"
11388,IV.--NIGHT,"of his crime--and not one _soldo_ shall escape me. Maffeo,"
11389,IV.--NIGHT,"the sword we quiet men spurn away, you shrewd knaves"
11390,IV.--NIGHT,pick up and commit murders with; what opportunities               105
11391,IV.--NIGHT,"the virtuous forego, the villainous seize. Because, to"
11392,IV.--NIGHT,"pleasure myself, apart from other considerations, my"
11393,IV.--NIGHT,"food would be millet-cake, my dress sackcloth, and my"
11394,IV.--NIGHT,"couch straw--am I therefore to let you, the offscouring"
11395,IV.--NIGHT,"of the earth, seduce the poor and ignorant by appropriating       110"
11396,IV.--NIGHT,a pomp these will be sure to think lessens the abominations
11397,IV.--NIGHT,so unaccountably and exclusively associated with
11398,IV.--NIGHT,"it? Must I let villas and _poderi_ go to you, a murderer"
11399,IV.--NIGHT,"and thief, that you may beget by means of them other"
11400,IV.--NIGHT,murderers and thieves? No--if my cough would but                  115
11401,IV.--NIGHT,allow me to speak!
11402,IV.--NIGHT,
11403,IV.--NIGHT,_Intendant._ What am I to expect? You are going to punish me?
11404,IV.--NIGHT,
11405,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ Must punish you, Maffeo. I cannot"
11406,IV.--NIGHT,afford to cast away a chance. I have whole centuries of
11407,IV.--NIGHT,"sin to redeem, and only a month or two of life to do it in.       120"
11408,IV.--NIGHT,How should I dare to say--
11409,IV.--NIGHT,
11410,IV.--NIGHT,"_Intendant._ ""Forgive us our trespasses""?"
11411,IV.--NIGHT,
11412,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ My friend, it is because I avow myself a"
11413,IV.--NIGHT,"very worm, sinful beyond measure, that I reject a line of"
11414,IV.--NIGHT,"conduct you would applaud perhaps. Shall I proceed,               125"
11415,IV.--NIGHT,"as it were, a-pardoning?--I?--who have no symptom"
11416,IV.--NIGHT,of reason to assume that aught less than my strenuousest
11417,IV.--NIGHT,"efforts will keep myself out of mortal sin, much less"
11418,IV.--NIGHT,"keep others out. No: I do trespass, but will not double"
11419,IV.--NIGHT,that by allowing you to trespass.                                 130
11420,IV.--NIGHT,
11421,IV.--NIGHT,_Intendant._ And suppose the villas are not your
11422,IV.--NIGHT,"brother's to give, nor yours to take? Oh, you are hasty"
11423,IV.--NIGHT,enough just now!
11424,IV.--NIGHT,
11425,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ 1, 2--No. 3!--aye, can you read the substance"
11426,IV.--NIGHT,"of a letter, No. 3, I have received from Rome? It                 135"
11427,IV.--NIGHT,"is precisely on the ground there mentioned, of the suspicion"
11428,IV.--NIGHT,"I have that a certain child of my late elder brother, who"
11429,IV.--NIGHT,"would have succeeded to his estates, was murdered in"
11430,IV.--NIGHT,"infancy by you, Maffeo, at the instigation of my late"
11431,IV.--NIGHT,younger brother--that the Pontiff enjoins on me not               140
11432,IV.--NIGHT,"merely the bringing that Maffeo to condign punishment,"
11433,IV.--NIGHT,"but the taking all pains, as guardian of the infant's heritage"
11434,IV.--NIGHT,"for the Church, to recover it parcel by parcel, howsoever,"
11435,IV.--NIGHT,"whensoever, and wheresoever. While you are now"
11436,IV.--NIGHT,"gnawing those fingers, the police are engaged in sealing          145"
11437,IV.--NIGHT,"up your papers, Maffeo, and the mere raising my voice"
11438,IV.--NIGHT,brings my people from the next room to dispose of yourself.
11439,IV.--NIGHT,"But I want you to confess quietly, and save me raising"
11440,IV.--NIGHT,"my voice. Why, man, do I not know the old story?"
11441,IV.--NIGHT,"The heir between the succeeding heir, and this heir's             150"
11442,IV.--NIGHT,"ruffianly instrument, and their complot's effect, and the"
11443,IV.--NIGHT,life of fear and bribes and ominous smiling silence? Did
11444,IV.--NIGHT,you throttle or stab my brother's infant? Come now!
11445,IV.--NIGHT,
11446,IV.--NIGHT,"_Intendant._ So old a story, and tell it no better?"
11447,IV.--NIGHT,When did such an instrument ever produce such an                  155
11448,IV.--NIGHT,"effect? Either the child smiles in his face, or, most likely,"
11449,IV.--NIGHT,he is not fool enough to put himself in the employer's
11450,IV.--NIGHT,power so thoroughly; the child is always ready to produce--as
11451,IV.--NIGHT,"you say--howsoever, wheresoever, and whensoever."
11452,IV.--NIGHT,
11453,IV.--NIGHT,_Monsignor._ Liar!                                                160
11454,IV.--NIGHT,
11455,IV.--NIGHT,"_Intendant._ Strike me? Ah, so might a father chastise!"
11456,IV.--NIGHT,"I shall sleep soundly tonight at least, though the gallows"
11457,IV.--NIGHT,await me tomorrow; for what a life did I lead! Carlo of
11458,IV.--NIGHT,"Cesena reminds me of his connivance, every time I pay"
11459,IV.--NIGHT,his annuity; which happens commonly thrice a year. If I           165
11460,IV.--NIGHT,"remonstrate, he will confess all to the good bishop--you!"
11461,IV.--NIGHT,
11462,IV.--NIGHT,"_Monsignor._ I see through the trick, caitiff! I would"
11463,IV.--NIGHT,"you spoke truth for once. All shall be sifted, however--seven"
11464,IV.--NIGHT,times sifted.
11465,IV.--NIGHT,
11466,IV.--NIGHT,_Intendant._ And how my absurd riches encumbered                  170
11467,IV.--NIGHT,me! I dared not lay claim to above half my possessions.
11468,IV.--NIGHT,"Let me but once unbosom myself, glorify Heaven, and die!"
11469,IV.--NIGHT,
11470,IV.--NIGHT,"Sir, you are no brutal, dastardly idiot like your brother"
11471,IV.--NIGHT,"I frightened to death: let us understand one another. Sir,"
11472,IV.--NIGHT,I will make away with her for you--the girl--here close           175
11473,IV.--NIGHT,at hand; not the stupid obvious kind of killing; do not
11474,IV.--NIGHT,speak--know nothing of her nor of me! I see her every
11475,IV.--NIGHT,day--saw her this morning. Of course there is to be no
11476,IV.--NIGHT,killing; but at Rome the courtesans perish off every three
11477,IV.--NIGHT,"years, and I can entice her thither--have indeed begun            180"
11478,IV.--NIGHT,"operations already. There's a certain lusty, blue-eyed,"
11479,IV.--NIGHT,florid-complexioned English knave I and the Police employ
11480,IV.--NIGHT,"occasionally. You assent, I perceive--no, that's not"
11481,IV.--NIGHT,it--assent I do not say--but you will let me convert my
11482,IV.--NIGHT,"present havings and holdings into cash, and give me time          185"
11483,IV.--NIGHT,"to cross the Alps? Tis but a little black-eyed, pretty"
11484,IV.--NIGHT,"singing Felippa, gay, silk-winding girl. I have kept her"
11485,IV.--NIGHT,out of harm's way up to this present; for I always intended
11486,IV.--NIGHT,to make your life a plague to you with her. 'Tis
11487,IV.--NIGHT,as well settled once and forever. Some women I have               190
11488,IV.--NIGHT,"procured will pass Bluphocks, my handsome scoundrel,"
11489,IV.--NIGHT,off for somebody; and once Pippa entangled!--you

11650,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,"The poem _Paracelsus_ is divided into five parts, each of which"

11652,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,"celebrated German-Swiss physician, alchemist, and philosopher of the"
11653,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,sixteenth century. Book I tells of the eagerness and pride with which he
11654,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,set out in his youth to compass all knowledge; he believed himself
11655,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,commissioned of God to learn Truth and to give it to mankind. Books II
11656,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,and III show him followed and idolized by multitudes to whom he imparts
11657,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,the fragments of knowledge he has gained. But though these fragments
11658,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,"seem to his disciples the sum and substance of wisdom, his own mind is"
11659,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,preoccupied with a desolating certainty that he has hardly touched on
11660,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,"the outer confines of truth. In Book IV, after experiencing the"
11661,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,"ingratitude of his fickle adherents, he is represented as abjuring the"
11662,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,dreams of his youth. At this point comes the first of the three songs
11663,SONGS FROM PARACELSUS,given in the text. He builds an imaginary altar on which he offers up

11717,SONG I,"dwells on the grandeur of his mind and achievements, and on the fame"
11718,SONG I,that shall be his. But the desired peace comes only when Festus sings

11759,THE LOST LEADER,
11760,THE LOST LEADER,This poem indignantly records a poet's defection from the cause of
11761,THE LOST LEADER,progress and liberty. Who this poet might be was for some time a matter
11762,THE LOST LEADER,"of conjecture. Wordsworth, Southey, and Charles Kingsley, all of whom"
11763,THE LOST LEADER,had gone from radicalism in their youth to conservatism in their old
11764,THE LOST LEADER,"age, were severally proposed as the original of Browning's portrait. The"
11765,THE LOST LEADER,"poem was published in 1845, two years after Wordsworth was made poet"
11766,THE LOST LEADER,"laureate. Early in 1845 Wordsworth was presented at court, a proceeding"
11767,THE LOST LEADER,"which aroused comment--sometimes amused, sometimes indignant--from those"
11768,THE LOST LEADER,who recalled the poet's early scorn of rank and titles. Browning and
11769,THE LOST LEADER,"Miss Barrett exchanged several gay letters on this subject in May, 1845."
11770,THE LOST LEADER,In commenting on a letter from Miss Martineau describing Wordsworth in
11771,THE LOST LEADER,"his home in 1846, Browning wrote, ""Did not Shelley say long ago, 'He had"
11772,THE LOST LEADER,no more imagination than a pint-pot'--though in those days he used to
11773,THE LOST LEADER,"walk about France and Flanders like a man. _Now_, he is 'most"
11774,THE LOST LEADER,comfortable in his worldly affairs' and just this comes of it! He lives
11775,THE LOST LEADER,the best twenty years of his life after the way of his own heart--and
11776,THE LOST LEADER,when one presses in to see the result of his rare experiment--what the
11777,THE LOST LEADER,_one_ alchemist whom fortune has allowed to get all his coveted
11778,THE LOST LEADER,materials and set to work at last with fire and melting pot--what he
11779,THE LOST LEADER,"produces after all the talk of him and the like of him; why, you get"
11780,THE LOST LEADER,"_pulvis et cinis_--a man at the mercy of the tongs and shovel."" In later"
11781,THE LOST LEADER,"life, however, Browning spoke of Wordsworth in a different tone. In a"
11782,THE LOST LEADER,"letter to Mr. Grosart, written Feb. 24, 1875, he said, ""I have been"
11783,THE LOST LEADER,"asked the question you now address me with, and as duly answered, I"
11784,THE LOST LEADER,can't remember how many times. There is no sort of objection to one more
11785,THE LOST LEADER,"assurance, or rather confession, on my part, that I _did_ in my hasty"
11786,THE LOST LEADER,youth presume to use the great and venerated personality of Wordsworth
11787,THE LOST LEADER,as a sort of painter's model; one from which this or the other
11788,THE LOST LEADER,particular feature may be selected and turned to account. Had I intended
11789,THE LOST LEADER,more--above all such a boldness as portraying the entire man--I should
11790,THE LOST LEADER,not have talked about 'handfuls of silver and bits of ribbon.' These
11791,THE LOST LEADER,never influenced the change of politics in the great poet--whose
11792,THE LOST LEADER,"defection, nevertheless, accompanied as it was by a regular face-about"
11793,THE LOST LEADER,"of his special party, was, to my private apprehension, and even mature"
11794,THE LOST LEADER,"consideration, an event to deplore. But, just as in the tapestry on my"
11795,THE LOST LEADER,"wall I can recognize figures which have _struck out_ a fancy, on"
11796,THE LOST LEADER,"occasion, that though truly enough thus derived, yet would be"
11797,THE LOST LEADER,"preposterous as a copy; so, though I dare not deny the original of my"
11798,THE LOST LEADER,"little poem, I altogether refuse to have it considered as the 'very"
11799,THE LOST LEADER,"effigies' of such a moral and intellectual superiority."" For an"

12003,A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S,exact musical connotation is doubtless obscure. But the epithets and
12004,A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S,phrases are in themselves sufficient to suggest the varying moods of
12005,A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S,"the Venetian merrymakers. The plaintiveness, the sighs, the sense of"
12006,A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S,"death, the trembling hope that life may last, the renewed love-making,"
12007,A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S,"the new round of futile pleasures or evil deeds, the end of it all in"
12008,A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S,"the grave, are clearly brought forth. An elaborate explanation of the"

12015,A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S,close in death. Now when the poet endeavors to turn from that picture of

12017,A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S,"mind with an inescapable sense of the futility of life, and even his own"
12018,A TOCCATA OF GALUPPI'S,"chosen mental activities seem to him, along with the rest, hardly more"

12302,SAUL,"of its old skin in the springtime, when it will come forth with new"

12308,SAUL,Albert S. Cook suggests that Browning is here indebted to the Greek
12309,SAUL,pastoral romance of _Daphnis and Chloe_. See Smith's translation in the
12310,SAUL,"Bohn edition. The passages read in part as follows: ""He ran through all"
12311,SAUL,"variations of pastoral melody; he played the tune which the oxen obey,"
12312,SAUL,and which attracts the goats--that in which the sheep delight.
12313,SAUL,
12314,SAUL,"""He took his pipe from his scrip, and breathed into it very gently. The"
12315,SAUL,"goats stood still, merely lifting up their heads. Next he played the"

12347,SAUL,"The look in his eyes as he comes back to life, yet seeing nothing in"
12348,SAUL,"life to desire, is compared to pale autumn sunsets seen over the ocean,"

12354,SAUL,
12355,SAUL,172. _Carouse in the past._ This line marks a change in the direction of
12356,SAUL,David's thought. Up to stanza X it was the glorious past that he had
12357,SAUL,been urging upon Saul's attention. But now he realizes that true
12358,SAUL,"inspiration comes not so much from a re-living of one's achievements, as"
12359,SAUL,from the thought of the permanence of one's fame and one's deeds.
12360,SAUL,
12361,SAUL,192. _And behold while I sang._ At this point David is overcome by the
12362,SAUL,memory of the sudden spiritual illumination that came to him in his
12363,SAUL,interview with Saul. He had reached the summit of his endeavor (l. 191)
12364,SAUL,and yet knew himself powerless to give the King new life. Then there
12365,SAUL,flashed upon him the truth expressed in stanzas XVII-XIX. He breaks off
12366,SAUL,"in lines 192-205, going, in his strong feeling, ahead of his story and"
12367,SAUL,commenting on what is described in stanza XIX. In stanza XV he resumes
12368,SAUL,his narrative.
12369,SAUL,
12370,SAUL,204. _Hebron._ David watches the slow coming of the dawn over the hill
12371,SAUL,on which is situated the town of Hebron.
12372,SAUL,
12373,SAUL,"205. _Kidron._ A brook near Jerusalem. It is fed by springs, and the"
12374,SAUL,amount of water in it is sensibly decreased by the extreme heat of the
12375,SAUL,day.
12376,SAUL,
12377,SAUL,"214. _Ere error had bent._ In _I Samuel_, Chapter xv, is an account of"
12378,SAUL,Saul's disobedience and punishment. The choosing of Saul to be king is
12379,SAUL,"described in _I Samuel_, Chapters ix and x."
12380,SAUL,
12381,SAUL,"292. _Sabaoth._ The word means ""hosts"" and is ordinarily used in the"
12382,SAUL,"phrase ""The Lord of hosts."" It represents the omnipotence of God."
12383,SAUL,
12384,SAUL,"303. _Nor leave up nor down_, etc. At the end of stanza xv, the thought"
12385,SAUL,that had come to David was that God had proved supreme in all the ways
12386,SAUL,"in which a human being could test knowledge and power, but that in the"
12387,SAUL,one way of love the creature might surpass the Creator. At line 302 he
12388,SAUL,has come to believe in the infinitude of God's love as well as in the
12389,SAUL,infinitude of His power. It is interesting to note that George Eliot in
12390,SAUL,_Silas Marner_ gives to ignorant Dolly Winthrop an experience and a
12391,SAUL,philosophy of life almost identical with those of Browning's David.
12392,SAUL,
12393,SAUL,"307-312. A prophecy of the revelation of the divine in the human, the"
12394,SAUL,coming of God in the person of Christ. It is the human in the divine
12395,SAUL,"that men seek and love. In the Old Testament days such an idea, though"
12396,SAUL,"foretold and longed for, could be but vaguely conceived except in"
12397,SAUL,moments of especial insight in the minds of poet-prophets like David.
12398,SAUL,"Mr. Herford (_Robert Browning_, p. 120) says of this passage:"
12399,SAUL,
12400,SAUL,"""David is occupied with no speculative question, but with the practical"
12401,SAUL,problem of saving a ruined soul; and neither logical ingenuity nor
12402,SAUL,"divine suggestion, but the inherent spiritual significance of the"
12403,SAUL,"situation, urges his thought along the lonely path of prophecy. The love"
12404,SAUL,"for the old King, which prompted him to try all the hidden paths of his"
12405,SAUL,"soul in quest of healing, becomes a lighted torch by which he tracks out"
12406,SAUL,the meaning of the world and the still unrevealed purposes of God; until
12407,SAUL,the energy of thought culminates in vision and the Christ stands full

12777,HOW IT STRIKES A CONTEMPORARY,popularly supposed to be the alertness of a secret agent of the

12802,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12803,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Fra Lippo Lippi was born in Florence in 1406. See Vasari's _Lives of the
12804,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Painters_ for the account of his life on which Browning based his poem.
12805,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,(Vasari's account is quoted in Cooke's _Browning Guide Book_.)
12806,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12807,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,2. _You need not clap your torches._ Throughout this lively dramatic
12808,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,monologue it is important to mark every indication of the words or
12809,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"gestures of the auditors; for instance, in lines 13, 18, 26, etc."
12810,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12811,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,7. _The Carmine._ Fra Lippo Lippi's entrance into the monastery of the
12812,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,friars del Carmine and his education there are described later in the
12813,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,poem. He lived there till he was twenty-six. He had no vocation for the
12814,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,life of a monk and wished to devote himself to painting. He apparently
12815,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,left the monastery on good terms with the friars.
12816,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12817,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,17. _Master--a Cosimo of the Medici._ Cosimo de Medici (1389-1464) was a
12818,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,rich Florentine banker and statesman. He was a magnificent patron of art
12819,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"and literature. The old Medici palace (l. 17), now known as _Palazzo"
12820,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Riccardi_, is on the corner of the _Via Cavour_ and the _Via Gori_. The"
12821,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"church of _San Lorenzo_ (the ""Saint Laurence"" of l. 67) is a short"
12822,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,distance farther west on the Via Gori.
12823,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12824,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,22. _Pick up a manner_. The painter protests against the rough usage to
12825,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,which he has been subjected.
12826,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12827,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"23. _Zooks._ An interjection formerly written ""gadzooks."" _Pilchards_"
12828,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,are a common cheap fish of the Mediterranean and are taken in seines.
12829,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12830,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,28. _Quarter-florin._ The florin was a gold coin of Florence. It was
12831,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,first struck off in the twelfth century and was called a florin because
12832,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,it had a flower stamped on one side.
12833,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12834,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,31. _I'd like his face._ The painter cannot look upon the crowd of men
12835,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,about him without seeing faces he would like to draw. One man would do
12836,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,as a model for Judas. Another would do well in a picture Fra Lippo's
12837,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,imagination quickly conjures up of a slave holding the head of John the
12838,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Baptist by the hair. In Fra Lippo's real picture of the beheading of
12839,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"John the Baptist the head is brought in by Salome, the daughter of"
12840,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Herodias, on a great platter."
12841,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12842,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"46. _Carnival._ The days preceding Lent. A period marked by much gaiety,"
12843,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"street revelry, masking, etc."
12844,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12845,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"53. _Flower o' the broom._ These flower songs, called _stornelli_, are"
12846,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"improvised by the peasants at their work. ""The _stornelli_ consists of"
12847,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,three lines. The first line usually contains the name of a flower which
12848,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,sets the rhyme and is five syllables long. Then the love theme is told
12849,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"in two lines of eleven syllables each, agreeing by rhyme, assonance, or"
12850,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"repetition with the first."" (Porter and Clarke note in Camberwell"
12851,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Edition.) Browning does not follow the model strictly.
12852,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12853,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,73. _Jerome._ St. Jerome was one of the Fathers of the Christian Church.
12854,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"During a part of his early life he was given up to worldly pleasures,"
12855,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,and for this he did penance by living for a number of years in a cave in
12856,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,a desert region. The penitent St. Jerome was a popular devotional
12857,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"subject in early Christian art. ""The scene is generally a wild rocky"
12858,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"solitude; St. Jerome, half-naked, emaciated, with matted hair and beard,"
12859,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"is seen on his knees before a crucifix, beating his breast with a"
12860,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"stone."" (Mrs. Jameson, _Sacred and Legendary Art_, i, 308.)"
12861,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12862,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"80. _What am I a beast for?_ If you had happened, says Fra Lippo, to"
12863,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"catch Cosimo in a frolic like this, of course you would have said"
12864,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,nothing; but you think a monk is a beast if he indulges in these
12865,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,nocturnal pleasures. Yet why should the fact that I break monastic rules
12866,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,make you consider me a beast? Just let me tell you how I happened to
12867,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,become a monk.
12868,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12869,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,83. _I starved there._ Note the vivid picture of the life of a street

12871,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12872,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"88. _Aunt Lapaccia._ Vasari says, ""The child was for some time under the"
12873,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"care of a certain Mona Lapaccia, his aunt, who brought him up with very"
12874,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"great difficulty till he had attained his eighth year, when, being no"
12875,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"longer able to support the burden of his maintenance, she placed him in"
12876,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"the above-named convent of the Carmelites."" ""Trussed,"" means ""firmly"
12877,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"seized."""
12878,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12879,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"117. _Which gentlemen_, etc. Gentlemen clad in fine ecclesiastical robes"
12880,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,walk in the religious procession and carry tall wax candles or torches;
12881,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,the drippings from these candles the street-urchin wishes to catch in
12882,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"order to sell them again, but it is against the law, and the fine"
12883,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"gentlemen if not kindly disposed may call in the magistrates (""The"
12884,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Eight"") and have the boy whipped."
12885,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12886,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,130. _The antiphonary's marge._ He scrawled his sketches on the margins
12887,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"of the book used by the choir, and he made faces out of the notes, which"
12888,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,were then square with long stems.
12889,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12890,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"139. _We Carmelites._ The three orders of monks, the Carmelites, the"
12891,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Camaldolese, and the Dominicans (called ""Preaching Brothers"" by Pope"
12892,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Innocent III) owned various monasteries and churches, and were each"
12893,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,ambitious to possess the greatest sacred paintings.
12894,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12895,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,145-163. These lines describe the different figures painted on the wall
12896,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"by Fra Lippo when the prior bade him ""daub away."" The monks dressed in"
12897,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,black or white according to the garb of their orders; the old women
12898,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,waiting to confess small thefts; the row of admiring little children
12899,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"gazing at a bearded fellow, a murderer who, still breathing hard with"
12900,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"the run that has brought him in safety to the altar steps, defies the"
12901,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""white anger"" of his victim's son, who has followed him into the church;"
12902,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"the girl who loves the brute of a murderer, and brings him flowers,"
12903,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"food, and her earrings to aid him when he shall escape--all these are"
12904,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,painted on the wall. Then the young artist took down the ladder by means
12905,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,of which he had reached the bit of cloister-wall where he had been
12906,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"recording his observations of life, and called the monks to see."
12907,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12908,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"156. _Whose sad face._ The purpose of Christ's suffering (""passion"") on"
12909,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"the cross was to bring love into the world, but after a thousand years"
12910,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"of his teaching his image looks down upon theft, anger, murder."
12911,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12912,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,172. _My triumph's straw-fire._ Lippo's triumph was as short-lived as a
12913,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,fire of straw. The monks were delighted with the realism of the
12914,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"painting, but when the Prior and the critics came they declared that"
12915,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"such ""homage to the perishable clay"" was a mere ""devil's game."" The"
12916,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"business of the painter, they said, was to ignore the body and paint the"
12917,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,soul.
12918,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12919,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,184. _Man's soul._ Note the difficulty the Prior experiences when he
12920,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"tries to describe the ""soul"" he wishes the artist to paint. Lines"
12921,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,185-186 represent an old superstition.
12922,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12923,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,189-198. In contrast to the homely realism of Fra Lippo's picture of
12924,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"ordinary people are the idealism, the religious symbolism, of the"
12925,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"pictures of Giotto, a painter a century and a half earlier than Fra"
12926,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lippo, and the greatest master of the early school of Italian art."
12927,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12928,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,198-214. An exposition of Fra Lippo's idea of painting. He says that it
12929,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"is nonsense to ignore the body in order to make the soul preëminent,"
12930,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"that the painter should go a ""double step"" and paint both body and soul."
12931,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"He may make the face of a girl as lovely and life-like as possible, and"
12932,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,at the same time show her soul in her face.
12933,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12934,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"215-220. A defense of the value of beauty for its own sake. Cf. Keats,"
12935,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"""Ode to a Grecian Urn,"" and the beginning of his ""Endymion."" Fra Lippo"
12936,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lippi has been long out of convent limitations, but he cannot forget how"
12937,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"certain the monks were that he had chosen the wrong path, and that he"
12938,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"could never equal the great painter, Fra Angelico (1389-1455), who,"
12939,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"kneeling in adoration, painted lovely saints and angels, nor even"
12940,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lorenzo Monaca, a Florentine painter with the same tendencies as"
12941,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,Angelico.
12942,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12943,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,257. _Out at grass._ _Grass_ in this passage stands for enjoyment of
12944,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,life as opposed to asceticism.
12945,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12946,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"276. _Guidi._ Tommaso Guidi, ordinarily known as Masaccio, or"
12947,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Tomassacio, Slovenly or Hulking Tom. Browning followed good authority in"
12948,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"making Masaccio a pupil of Fra Lippo Lippi, but in point of fact he was"
12949,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,probably the master whose works Fra Lippo studied. Lübke (_History of
12950,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Art_ ii, 207) says of Guidi: ""In his exceedingly short life he rapidly"
12951,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"traversed the various stages of development of earlier art, and pressed"
12952,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,on with a bold confidence to a greatness and power of vision which have
12953,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"rendered his works the characteristic ones of an epoch, and his example"
12954,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,a decisive influence in all the art of the fifteenth century.... Almost
12955,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,every master in the fifteenth century ... studied these great works and
12956,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,learned from them. One of the first of these masters was Fra Lippo
12957,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"Lippi."" The important point is that Fra Lippo and Masaccio were both"
12958,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,pioneers in the new art which took infinite pains in the representation
12959,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,of the body. Masaccio is said to have been the first Italian artist to
12960,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,paint a nude figure.
12961,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12962,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"323. _A Saint Laurence ... at Prato._ Prato a town near Florence,"
12963,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,"attracted many artists in the fifteenth century, so that one finds there"
12964,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,many specimens of Early Renaissance painting. Some of the most important
12965,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,of Fra Lippo Lippi's large works are in the Cathedral at Prato.
12966,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,
12967,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,326-334. The people have been so enraged at the slaves who are pictured
12968,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,as assisting in the martyrdom of St. Laurence that the faces of these
12969,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,slaves have been scratched from the wall. The monks think the picture a
12970,FRA LIPPO LIPPI,huge success because it has thus roused religious zeal.

13030,ANDREA DEL SARTO,The bare facts of this poem are taken from Vasari's _Lives of the

13035,ANDREA DEL SARTO,"(see ""John Kenyon and His Friends"" in _Temple Bar Magazine_, April,"

13343,ABT VOGLER,
13344,ABT VOGLER,Abbé (or Abt) Vogler (1749-1814) was a Catholic priest well known a
13345,ABT VOGLER,century ago as an organist and a composer. He founded three schools of
13346,ABT VOGLER,"music, one at Mannheim, one at Stockholm, and one at Darmstadt. He was"
13347,ABT VOGLER,"especially noted for his organ recitals, as many as 7000 tickets having"
13348,ABT VOGLER,been sold for a single recital in Amsterdam. In 1798 it was said that he
13349,ABT VOGLER,had then given over a thousand organ concerts. His knowledge of
13350,ABT VOGLER,acoustics and his consequent skill in combining the stops enabled him to
13351,ABT VOGLER,bring much power and variety from organs with fewer pipes than were
13352,ABT VOGLER,generally considered necessary. The remodeling and simplification of
13353,ABT VOGLER,organs was one of his most eagerly pursued activities. He not only
13354,ABT VOGLER,"rearranged the pipes, but he introduced free reeds. Through some"
13355,ABT VOGLER,skillful Swedish organ-builders he was at last enabled to have an organ
13356,ABT VOGLER,small enough to be portable and constructed according to his ideas. This
13357,ABT VOGLER,"he called an ""orchestrion."" Of Vogler's power as an organist Rinck says,"
13358,ABT VOGLER,"""His organ playing was grand, effective in the utmost degree."" It was,"
13359,ABT VOGLER,"however, when he was improvising that his power was most astonishing."
13360,ABT VOGLER,"Once at a musical soirée Vogler and Beethoven extemporized alternately,"
13361,ABT VOGLER,"each giving the other a theme, and Gansbacher records the pitch of"
13362,ABT VOGLER,enthusiasm to which he was roused by Vogler's masterly playing. Three of
13363,ABT VOGLER,"Voglers most famous pupils at Darmstadt were Meyerbeer, Gansbacher, and"
13364,ABT VOGLER,Carl Maria von Weber. The last of these gives an attractive picture of
13365,ABT VOGLER,"the musician extemporizing in the old church at Darmstadt. ""Never,"" says"
13366,ABT VOGLER,"Weber, ""did Vogler in his extemporization drink more deeply at the"
13367,ABT VOGLER,"source of all beauty, than when before his three dear boys, as he liked"
13368,ABT VOGLER,"to call us, he drew from the organ angelic voices and word of thunder."""
13369,ABT VOGLER,Browning's poem records the experiences of the musician in one of these
13370,ABT VOGLER,moods of rapturous creation.
13371,ABT VOGLER,
13372,ABT VOGLER,The argument of the poem is thus given by Mr. Stopford Brooke in _The

13377,ABT VOGLER,"touched the keys, I called the Spirits of Sound to me, and they have"
13378,ABT VOGLER,built my palace of music; and to inhabit it all the Great Dead came back
13379,ABT VOGLER,"till in the vision I made a perfect music. Nay, for a moment, I touched"
13380,ABT VOGLER,in it the infinite perfection; but now it is gone; I cannot bring it
13381,ABT VOGLER,"back. Had I painted it, had I written it, I might have explained it. But"
13382,ABT VOGLER,"in music out of the sounds something emerges which is above the sounds,"
13383,ABT VOGLER,and that ineffable thing I touched and lost. I took the well-known
13384,ABT VOGLER,"sounds of earth, and out of them came a fourth sound, nay not a"
13385,ABT VOGLER,sound--but a star. This was a flash of God's will which opened the
13386,ABT VOGLER,Eternal to me for a moment; and I shall find it again in the eternal

13390,ABT VOGLER,"before us in human life, breathe for a moment, and then depart; which,"

13506,RABBI BEN EZRA,Ben Ezra was an eminent Jewish Rabbi of the Middle Ages. His

13508,RABBI BEN EZRA,"A. J. Campbell, who has studied Browning's poem in connection with the"

13511,RABBI BEN EZRA,"were drawn from the works of the historical Rabbi, the keynote of whose"

13524,RABBI BEN EZRA,proof of the spark of divinity which separates men from beasts and
13525,RABBI BEN EZRA,allies them to God. It is a characteristic Browning doctrine that
13526,RABBI BEN EZRA,"conflict, struggle, the pangs and throes of learning, are the stimuli"

13553,RABBI BEN EZRA,moment in which to appraise the work of the day. In the application of
13554,RABBI BEN EZRA,"the simile to the life of man (lines 97-102) the ""moment"" apparently"
13555,RABBI BEN EZRA,refers to old age when man has leisure and wisdom to appraise the Past.

13558,RABBI BEN EZRA,death.
13559,RABBI BEN EZRA,
13560,RABBI BEN EZRA,"109-111. In ""Old Pictures in Florence"" Browning applies this idea to the"
13561,RABBI BEN EZRA,development of art. As soon as men were content to repose in the
13562,RABBI BEN EZRA,"perfection of Greek art (the thing ""found made"") stagnation ensued; the"
13563,RABBI BEN EZRA,"new life of art came when men strove for something new and original,"
13564,RABBI BEN EZRA,"even though their first attempts were crude (""acts uncouth"")."
13565,RABBI BEN EZRA,
13566,RABBI BEN EZRA,120. _Nor let thee feel alone._ The solitude of age gives a chance for
13567,RABBI BEN EZRA,unhampered thought.
13568,RABBI BEN EZRA,
13569,RABBI BEN EZRA,133-150. One of the things he has learned is that any judgment to be
13570,RABBI BEN EZRA,"fair must take into account instincts, efforts, desires, as well as"
13571,RABBI BEN EZRA,accomplishment.
13572,RABBI BEN EZRA,
13573,RABBI BEN EZRA,"151-186. This metaphor of the wheel is found in _Isaiah_ lxiv, 8;"
13574,RABBI BEN EZRA,"_Jeremiah_ xviii, 2-6; _Romans_ ix, 21. Throughout this metaphor as"
13575,RABBI BEN EZRA,"Browning uses it, man seems to be ""passive clay"" in the hands of the"
13576,RABBI BEN EZRA,"potter, and under the power of the ""machinery"" the potter uses to give"
13577,RABBI BEN EZRA,"the soul its bent. The tone of the whole poem is, however, one of"
13578,RABBI BEN EZRA,"strenuous endeavor. Ardor, effort, progress, are the keynotes of life"
13579,RABBI BEN EZRA,from youth to age. But life is finally counted a divine training for the
13580,RABBI BEN EZRA,"service of God, and in this training the pious Rabbi sees joined the"
13581,RABBI BEN EZRA,will of man and the care and guidance of God.

13587,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13588,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"The idea of this poem was evolved from Shakspere's Caliban, a strange,"
13589,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"misshapen, fish-like being, one of the servants of Prospero in _The"
13590,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,Tempest_. He was the son of a foul witch who had potent ministers and
13591,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"could control moon and tides, but could not undo her own hateful"
13592,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"sorceries, and who worshiped a god called Setebos. Morally, Shakspere's"
13593,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"Caliban was insensible to kindness, had bestial passions, was cowardly,"
13594,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"vengeful, superstitious. He had keen animal instincts and knew the"
13595,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"island well. He understood Prospero in some measure; learned to talk, to"
13596,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"know the stars, to compose poetry, and took pleasure in music."
13597,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13598,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"_Thou thoughtest_, etc. A quotation from _Psalms_ 1, 21. This sentence"
13599,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,is the keynote of Caliban's theological speculations.
13600,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13601,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"1. _Will_. For ""he will"" instead of ""I will."" Through most of the poem"
13602,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,Caliban speaks of himself in the third person as a child does. But note
13603,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"lines 68-97, where Caliban rises to unusual mental heights under the"
13604,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,stimulus of the gourd-fruit-mash and uses the first person. How is it in
13605,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"ll. 100-108, 135-136, 160?"
13606,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13607,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,1-23. This portion of Caliban's soliloquy and the portion in lines
13608,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"284-295 give the setting for his speculations. The hot, still summer day"
13609,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,creates a mood in which Caliban's ideas flow out easily into speech. The
13610,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,thunderstorm at the end abruptly calls him back from his speculations to
13611,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,his normal state of subservience and superstitious fear.
13612,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13613,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,24. _Setebos._ The god of the Patagonians. When the natives were taken
13614,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"prisoners by Magellan, they ""cryed upon their devil Setebos to help"
13615,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"them."" Eden, _History of Travaile_."
13616,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13617,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,25. _He._ The pronoun of the third person when referring to Setebos is
13618,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,capitalized.
13619,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13620,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,31. _It came of being ill at ease._ Each step in Caliban's reasoning
13621,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,proceeds from some personal experience or observation. In this case he
13622,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,reasons from the fish to Setebos. Caliban attributes to Setebos
13623,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,unlimited power to create and control in whatever is comparatively near
13624,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,at hand and changeable. But Caliban had been affected by the mystery of
13625,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,the starry heavens. The remoteness and fixedness of the stars had
13626,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"suggested a quiet, unalterable, passionless force beyond Setebos, who"
13627,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"must, therefore, have limitations. He did not make the stars (l. 27), he"
13628,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"cannot create a mate like himself (ll. 57-8), he cannot change his"
13629,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"nature so as to be like the Quiet above him (ll. 144-5). Hence, like the"
13630,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"fish, Setebos had a dissatisfied consciousness of a bliss he was not"
13631,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"born for. Discontent with himself, spite, envy, restlessness, love of"
13632,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"power as a means of distraction, are the motives that, according to"
13633,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"Caliban's reasoning, actuated Setebos in his creation of the world."
13634,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13635,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"45. _The fowls here, beast and creeping thing._ Browning's remarkably"
13636,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,minute and accurate knowledge of small animals is well illustrated by
13637,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"this poem. For further illustration see _Saul_, the last soliloquy in"
13638,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"_Pippa Passes_, and the lyric ""Thus the Mayne glideth."""
13639,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13640,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"75. _Put case_, etc. In determining the natural attitude of Setebos"
13641,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"toward his creations, the formula Caliban uses is, Caliban plus power"
13642,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,equals Setebos. The illustration from the bird (ll. 75-97) shows
13643,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"cruelty, and unreasoning, capricious exercise of power. The caprice of"
13644,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,Setebos is further emphasized in ll. 100-108.
13645,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13646,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,117. _Hath cut a pipe._ In his attitude toward his creatures Setebos is
13647,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,envious of all human worth or happiness if it is for a moment
13648,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,unconscious of absolute dependence on him.
13649,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13650,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"150. _Himself peeped late_, etc. As Caliban gets some poor solace out of"
13651,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"imitating Prospero, so one reason for Setebos's creation of the world"
13652,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,was a half-scornful attempt to delude himself into apparent content. His
13653,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"imitations, his ""make believes,"" are the unwilling homage his weakness"
13654,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,pays to the power of the Quiet.
13655,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13656,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,170-184. The weaknesses of all living beings were special devices
13657,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"whereby Setebos could, through need and fear, torture and rule."
13658,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13659,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,185-199. Setebos worked also out of pure ennui. He liked the exercise of
13660,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"power, he liked to use his ""wit,"" and he needed distraction."
13661,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13662,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,200-210. Setebos hates and favors human beings without discoverable
13663,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,reason.
13664,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,
13665,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,211-285. It is impossible to discover a way to please Setebos. His favor
13666,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,goes by caprice as does Caliban's with the daring squirrel and the
13667,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"terrified urchin, who please one day, and, doing the same things the"
13668,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,"next, would bring down vengeance. The only philosophy at which Caliban"
13669,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,can arrive is that it is best not to be too happy. Simulated misery is
13670,CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS,more likely to escape than any show of happiness.

13730,HOUSE AND SHOP,"contains a quotation from Wordsworth's ""Scorn not the Sonnet"" to the"

13898,INSTANS TYRANNUS,not frightened by the frown of the threatening tyrant--_non vullus
13899,INSTANS TYRANNUS,instantis tyranni_. Archdeacon Farrar refers the incidents to
13900,INSTANS TYRANNUS,persecution of the early Christians. The poem certainly deals with some
13901,INSTANS TYRANNUS,period when the ruler of a great realm had unlimited power to follow out
13902,INSTANS TYRANNUS,"his most insignificant animosities, and when just men and just causes"
13903,INSTANS TYRANNUS,had no human recourse.

13908,INSTANS TYRANNUS,6. _What was his force?_ An ironic question. The man groveled because he

13914,INSTANS TYRANNUS,"friends whom he loved, then there would be obvious ways of hurting him,"
13915,INSTANS TYRANNUS,he would stand forth in sufficient importance to make the swing of the
13916,INSTANS TYRANNUS,"tyrant's hand effective. But as it is, the man's poverty and"
13917,INSTANS TYRANNUS,friendlessness and meagerness of life render it difficult to find out
13918,INSTANS TYRANNUS,"vulnerable points of attack. He remains hidden (_perdue_) and, like the"

13926,INSTANS TYRANNUS,in his attitude toward his enemy. In lines 35-43 he feels a moment of
13927,INSTANS TYRANNUS,"contemptuous compunction at the man's suffering, and recognizes the"
13928,INSTANS TYRANNUS,absurdity of a contest between a great king and a person as
13929,INSTANS TYRANNUS,"insignificant as a tricksy elf, a toad, or a rat. But in line 44 his"
13930,INSTANS TYRANNUS,mood turns. He perceives that the burden (_gravamen_) of the whole
13931,INSTANS TYRANNUS,"matter lies in the incredibly petty nature of this unconquerable,"
13932,INSTANS TYRANNUS,baffling opposition to his will. He sees how the situation would awaken
13933,INSTANS TYRANNUS,"the wonder of the great lords who abjectly obey his lightest word, but"

13938,INSTANS TYRANNUS,"powerless a foe, and then the striking reversal of position when the man"

13947,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,there were always small bands of patriots who stirred up revolutions
13948,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"against Austria. The chief revolution was that led by Mazzini in 1848,"
13949,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,and when he was in exile he read this poem with much appreciation. In
13950,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"_Pippa Passes_ (1840), in the story of Luigi and the Austrian police,"
13951,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,Browning had already given a picture based on Italy's struggle for
13952,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"freedom. In 1844 he visited Italy and then wrote ""The Italian in"

14185,"IV, 41.)",the words. Lutwyche's hate is to have its most hideous possible aspect

14204,INTERLUDE II,name is Maffeo) has charge of the estate the Bishop has just inherited
14205,INTERLUDE II,from his brother. The money Bluphocks has is the bribe given him by
14206,INTERLUDE II,"Maffeo to destroy Pippa, who is really the heir to the estate. Maffeo"

14246,INTERLUDE II,Rabelais. Hertrippa is a magician who gives Panurge advice on the
14247,INTERLUDE II,subject of marriage. Bluphocks is simply racking his brain for words to

14251,INTERLUDE II,77. _Carbonari._ All persons leaving a city had to have a passport
14252,INTERLUDE II,officially signed giving the destination and the date of departure.
14253,INTERLUDE II,"Luigi had obtained such a passport for Vienna for that night. It was,"
14254,INTERLUDE II,"however, suspected that this was a mere trick to give a wrong notion of"
14255,INTERLUDE II,"his whereabouts. If the passport should prove to be a pretense, other"
14256,INTERLUDE II,suspicions against Luigi would be confirmed; it would be taken for
14257,INTERLUDE II,"granted that he belonged to the Carbonari, a secret society of Italian"
14258,INTERLUDE II,patriots; he would be arrested and sent to the prison at Spielberg. But
14259,INTERLUDE II,"if he should go to Vienna he is to be let alone. The officers are, of"
14260,INTERLUDE II,"course, on the wrong track. If Luigi goes to Vienna it is to carry out"
14261,INTERLUDE II,his purpose of killing the tyrant. If he stays in Asolo it means that he
14262,INTERLUDE II,has abandoned that purpose.

14265,EVENING,
14266,EVENING,6. _Lucius Junius._ This name comes easily to Luigi's lips because
14267,EVENING,Lucius Junius Brutus inspired the Romans against Tarquin.
14268,EVENING,
14269,EVENING,"14. _Old Franz._ The Austrian Emperor, Francis, I. Luigi's fancy is"

14271,EVENING,idea of the freedom of Italy.
14272,EVENING,

14277,EVENING,against Austria.
14278,EVENING,
14279,EVENING,135-143. Note in these lines how little Luigi really understands of the
14280,EVENING,point at issue. His emotional temperament has been stirred to the point
14281,EVENING,"of desperate action, but the ""ground for killing the King"" he hardly"
14282,EVENING,knows.

14289,EVENING,betrothed Chiara had planned to see together.
14290,EVENING,
14291,EVENING,164. _A king lived long ago._ This song was published in 1835 and later
14292,EVENING,adapted for this poem. The song has a great effect on Luigi because
14293,EVENING,beside his mental picture of the hated Austrian ruler he now places his
14294,EVENING,"old folk-king who judged his people wisely, whose dignity and grace awed"
14295,EVENING,"even a python, and whom the gods loved. The possibility of having good"
14296,EVENING,kings stirs his waning determination to rid the earth of evil ones.

14343,NIGHT,
14344,NIGHT,135. _Letter No. 3._ The information from Rome is based on a wrong
14345,NIGHT,assumption. The elder brother had an infant heir whom the second brother
14346,NIGHT,endeavored to put out of the way in order that he might himself inherit
14347,NIGHT,"the estate. He hired Maffeo to destroy the child, and, according to the"
14348,NIGHT,"information from Rome, Maffeo did so. On this assumption Maffeo is to be"
14349,NIGHT,arrested and the money and land given him by the second brother to keep
14350,NIGHT,the deed a secret are now to revert to the church.
14351,NIGHT,
14352,NIGHT,154. _So old a story._ In reality Maffeo has been more astute than they
14353,NIGHT,thought. He did not kill the child but kept it ready to produce as the
14354,NIGHT,heir to the estates if the second brother at any time proved delinquent
14355,NIGHT,in the required payments.
14356,NIGHT,
14357,NIGHT,174. _Let us understand one another._ He believes that when the Bishop
14358,NIGHT,"sees himself about to lose the estate, he too will show himself ready"
14359,NIGHT,for a bargain. The Bishop is simply to keep still and Maffeo will see
14360,NIGHT,that the heir--who is Pippa--shall be finally brought to shame and
14361,NIGHT,"death. The Bishop is to have the estates, and Maffeo is to keep his"
14362,NIGHT,ill-gotten gains and be given a chance to escape. The Bishop is
14363,NIGHT,apparently listening to the tempter when he hears Pippa's song. Its
14364,NIGHT,"fresh lilting sweetness, and especially, perhaps, the wording of the"
14365,NIGHT,"last line, touch his heart and his conscience, and he suddenly orders"
14366,NIGHT,"Maffeo's arrest, at the same time uttering the prayer, ""Have mercy upon"
