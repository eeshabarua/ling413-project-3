114,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Francis Thompson, a poet of high thinking, ""of celestial vision,"" and"
115,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"of imaginings that found literary images of answering splendour, died"
116,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,in London in the winter of 1907. His life--always a fragile
117,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"one--doubtless owed its prolongation to ""man's unconquerable mind,"" in"
118,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,him so invincible through all vicissitude that he seemed to add a new
119,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,significance to Wordsworth's phrase. To his mortal frame was denied the
120,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"vitality that informs his verse. Howbeit, his verse was himself; he"
121,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"lived every line of it, fulfilling to the last letter his own"
122,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"description of the poet, piteous yet proud:"
123,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
124,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,He lives detachèd days;
125,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,He serveth not for praise;
126,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,For gold
127,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,He is not sold.
128,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
129,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,He asketh not world's eyes;
130,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Nor to world's ears he cries--
131,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Saith, ""These"
132,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Shut, if ye please!"""
133,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
134,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,To this aloof moth of a man science was nearly as absorbing an interest
135,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"as was the mysticism that some thought had eaten him up; and, to give a"
136,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"light example of his actuality, he who had scarce handled a bat since"
137,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"he left Ushaw College, knew every famous score of the last quarter of"
138,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"a century, and left among his papers cricket-verses, trivial yet"
139,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,tragic. One such verse acquaints us incidentally with his Lancashire
140,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,lineage:
141,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
142,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,"
143,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Though my own red roses there may blow;
144,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,"
145,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Though the red roses crest the caps, I know."
146,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"For the field is full of shades as I near the shadowy coast,"
147,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,"
148,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host
149,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"As the run-stealers flicker to and fro,"
150,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,To and fro.
151,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!
152,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
153,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Born at Preston in 1859, the son of a doctor afterwards in practice at"
154,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Ashton-under-Lyne, he inherited no literary traditions. He had, to be"
155,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"sure, an uncle, an Oxford convert to Catholicism from the ranks of the"
156,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Anglican clergy, whose name appears on the title page of _Tracts_"
157,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"which, perhaps because for their own Times, seem assuredly for no"
158,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,other. The seven years Francis Thompson passed at Ushaw--a college near
159,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Durham, which then possessed few literary traditions besides those of"
160,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Lingard, Waterton and Wiseman, but can now boast Lafcadio Hearn's as"
161,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"well as Thompson's own--were, no doubt, influential for him; for a"
162,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"certain individualism, still lingering in outstanding seats of"
163,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"learning, gave him a lucky freedom to follow his own bent--the ample"
164,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"reading of the classics. After Ushaw he went to Owens College, to"
165,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,qualify for his father's profession; in his preliminary examination
166,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,distinguishing himself in Greek. His attempts to translate dead
167,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,language into living dated back to these days; though of the list of
168,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"words, which some who were amused and others who were irritated put"
169,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"down to his own inventing, many were made familiar to him in his"
170,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"intercourse with Milton, with Shelley, with Shakspere--his most vital"
171,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"companions. If these poets went, like Alexander, as far as Chaos, and"
172,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"if Thompson hazarded one step more, as Emerson said Goethe did,"
173,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Thompson too swung himself safely back again. In Manchester,"
174,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Literature, if not Melancholy, had already marked him for her own; and"
175,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,it was his _Religio Medici_ rather than his _Materia Medica_ that he
176,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"put under his pillow, perhaps the lump of it suggesting to him his"
177,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,after image about the poet's dreaming:
178,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
179,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,The hardest pang whereon
180,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,He lays his mutinous head may be a Jacob's stone.
181,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
182,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,A definite reminiscence of the dissecting-room at Manchester may
183,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,certainly be discovered in his allusion (in _An Anthem of Earth_) to
184,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,the heart as
185,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
186,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"_Arras'd in purple_ like the house of kings,"
187,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,the regal heart that comes at last
188,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"To stall the grey rat, and the carrion-worm"
189,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Statelily lodge.
190,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
191,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Possibly the sorrow of filial duty unperformed--a sorrow deeper with
192,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,him than is common among such predestined delinquents--aggravated the
193,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,bodily ailments which already beset him; and drastic indeed were the
194,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"remedies he himself prescribed. ""Physician, heal thyself"": the dire"
195,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"taunt took flesh, as it were, in Francis Thompson, and his plight was"
196,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,visible to all men. Himself he could not save. Biography strangely
197,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"repeats itself, not in common mental experience only, but also in"
198,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"uncovenanted details of fact and incident. Like De Quincey, whose"
199,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"writings he took into his blood, Thompson had a nervous illness in"
200,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Manchester; like De Quincey he went to London, and knew Oxford Street"
201,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"for a stony-hearted stepmother; his wealth, like De Quincey's once, lay"
202,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"in two volumes, for he carried Æschylus in one pocket, Blake in the"
203,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"other; and the parallel might, if to profit, be further outdrawn."
204,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
205,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,To most incongruous modes of making a living he now put his hand. His
206,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,assistantship in a shop near Leicester Square would have fitted him for
207,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"the production of a record of _Adventures among Boots_; and later, as a"
208,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"""collector"" for a bookseller he must often have bent beneath the sack,"
209,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"which, if heavy, so he might comfort himself, was at least heavy with"
210,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"books. Of these things he spoke with a matter-of-fact, all-accepting,"
211,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"simplicity when, a little later, some verses he sent to a magazine"
212,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"brought him believers, who sought until they found him. After a course"
213,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"of medical treatment, he went to Storrington. That beautiful Sussex"
214,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,village has now its fixed place on the map of English literature. For
215,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,there it was that Francis Thompson discovered his possibilities as a
216,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"poet. On its common he met the village child, whom he calls ""Daisy,"" in"
217,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,the verses that are so named. And it was characteristic of this poet
218,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"that from the ordinary episodes of ordinary days he made his ""golden"
219,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"musics."" When he saw the sunset at Storrington, the resulting Ode was"
220,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"dotted with local landmarks--the cross, for instance, casting its"
221,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"shadow in the monastery garden. The children of the family in London,"
222,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"into which he was received, were the subjects of _Poppy_, _The Making"
223,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"of Viola_, _To Monica Thought Dying_, _To my Godchild_--all in the"
224,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,first book of _Poems_; while two of their number have a noble heritage
225,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"in _Sister Songs_. Constant to the end, when he died some newly"
226,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"pencilled lines were found, addressed ""To Olivia,"" a yet younger"
227,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"sister, recalling the strains of fifteen years before:"
228,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
229,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"I fear to love you, Sweet, because"
230,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Love's the ambassador of loss.
231,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
232,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"To their mother likewise were addressed the poems of Fair Love,"
233,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"labelled _Love in Dian's Lap_, of which Coventry Patmore said that"
234,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"""Laura might have been proud""; hers also were many of the _New Poems_."
235,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
236,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"If, therefore, as one critic after another declared, a poet had dropped"
237,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"from the skies--those skies of light--of the Seventeenth Century, he"
238,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"dropped very much upon the spot. ""Mr Thompson must simply be Crashaw"
239,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"born again, but born greater,"" declared the first of his reviewers; and"
240,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Mr Traill, in _The Nineteenth Century_, inquired: ""Where, unless"
241,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"perhaps here and there in a sonnet of Rossetti's, has this sort of"
242,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,sublimated enthusiasm for the bodily and spiritual beauty of womanhood
243,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"found such expression between the age of the Stuarts and our own?"" Mr"
244,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Traill added boldly his belief--daring then, though acceptable enough"
245,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"now--that ""alike in wealth and dignity of imagination, in depth and"
246,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"subtlety of thought and in magic and mastery of language,"" England"
247,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"possessed in this little volume the evidence of ""a new poet of the"
248,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"first rank."" More expectedly, Coventry Patmore, in _The Fortnightly"
249,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Review_, hailed in the new-comer a disciple of their common master, the"
250,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Florentine Poet of Fair Love, and expressed the opinion that ""Mr"
251,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Thompson's qualities ought to place him in the permanent ranks of
252,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"fame."" The _Hound of Heaven_ was to Patmore ""one of the very few"
253,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"_great_ odes of which the language can boast."""
254,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
255,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Such pronouncements proved at least that a poet, who had no friend save"
256,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"such as his published poems gained for him, could count on an immediate"
257,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"recognition for high merit. For these tributes, and many more of like"
258,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"welcoming, placed him instantly out of range of the common casualties"
259,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,of criticism. And he had what poets of old to their great sorrow
260,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,lacked; he had trial by his peers; a kind fate gave him fellow poets
261,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,among his reviewers.
262,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
263,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Perhaps a more convincing sign even than that of professional praise
264,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,was conveyed by the chance allusion he lighted on later in Lady
265,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Burne-Jones's biography of her husband: ""The winter's labour,"" she"
266,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"says, ""was cheered by the appearance of a small volume of poems by an"
267,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,author whose name (Francis Thompson) was till then unknown to us. The
268,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"little book moved him to admiration and hope."" And, speaking of _The"
269,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Hound of Heaven_, Burne-Jones himself said: ""Since Gabriel's 'Blessed"
270,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Damozel' no mystical words have so touched me. Shall I ever forget how
271,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"I undressed and dressed again, and had to undress again--a thing I most"
272,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"hate--because I could think of nothing else?"""
273,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
274,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"_Sister Songs_, published in 1895--the poem of which Mr William Archer"
275,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"has said that ""Shelley would have adored it""--is a poem to read aloud;"
276,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,for sound and sense herein celebrate their divine nuptials. One of the
277,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,high memories of the present writer is that of hearing it so read by Mr
278,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,George Wyndham at the hearthstone of Byron's granddaughter. The lines
279,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"therein that deal with sex, dormant in the child-girl, yielded the poet"
280,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"perhaps his most amazing imagery. ""Superabundance,"" murmured"
281,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"some--surely a ""fault"" as happy as was ever son of Adam's. The charge"
282,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,of obscurity brought against the poem was more apt; for who that did
283,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"not know of his days--and his nights--in the London streets, could"
284,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,follow such a poignant piece of autobiography as this?
285,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
286,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Forlorn, and faint, and stark,"
287,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,I had endured through watches of the dark
288,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,The abashless inquisition of each star;
289,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Yea, was the outcast mark"
290,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Of all those heavenly passers' scrutiny;
291,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Stood bound and helplessly
292,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,For Time to shoot his barbèd minutes at me;
293,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Suffered the trampling hoof of every hour
294,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,In night's slow-wheelèd car;
295,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Until the tardy dawn dragged me at length
296,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"From under those dread wheels; and, bled of strength,"
297,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,I waited the inevitable last.
298,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Then there came past
299,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"A child; like thee, a spring-flower; but a flower"
300,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Fallen from the budded coronal of Spring,"
301,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,And through the city-streets blown withering.
302,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"She passed,--O brave, sad, lovingest, tender thing!--"
303,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"And of her own scant pittance did she give,"
304,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,That I might eat and live:
305,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Then fled, a swift and trackless fugitive."
306,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
307,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,And how shall that final episode be turned more explicitly? There are
308,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"still a few things left that cannot be uttered, or, if uttered, that"
309,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"become the counterpart, even for the willing ear, of that ""tenuity of"
310,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"the bat's cry"" reported to elude the common hearing. It is even as"
311,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Balzac, great talker himself, says, that everything (especially"
312,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,theology I think) is the cheaper for being discussed. Yet this untold
313,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"story transcends the mere romance of De Quincey's Ann, and might,"
314,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"indeed, for a moment, reverse Rossetti's just indictment of the life of"
315,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"""Jenny""--""It makes a goblin of the sun."" For this ""flower fallen from"
316,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"the budded coronal of Spring"" took root and flourished, even in London"
317,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"mire, and again the fragrant petals unfolded and the greenery grew."
318,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
319,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,In _New Poems_ Francis Thompson put forth in _The Mistress of Vision_
320,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,his stark gospel of renunciation. It is the last word of an asceticism
321,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,which he practised as well as preached--most strait in its abnegation
322,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"of everything but the beauty his verse, unlike his life, never could"
323,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"renounce. Coventry Patmore, Thompson's true ""Captain of Song,"" used to"
324,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"say that the young poet's prose was even finer than his poetry, and his"
325,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,talk better than both. This was a statement with the true Patmorean
326,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"touch of paradox. Any way, the talk had no reporter, and of his"
327,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"prose--his ""heroic prose,"" as it has been called--only one example"
328,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"passed, during his life, into book form--the complaint made by Brother"
329,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Ass, the Body, against its rider, the Soul. This was published under"
330,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"the title of _Health and Holiness_, accompanied by a Note from Father"
331,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Tyrrell. But his experiences in prose, as a reviewer, were wide as his"
332,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"sympathies, and these were sanely universal. His articles in _The"
333,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Academy_, under Mr Lewis Hind's editorship, must choke up many a"
334,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"scrapbook. Later, his contributions to _The Athenæum_ afforded him his"
335,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,greatest scope and stimulant; and only with his death came the eclipse
336,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"of his powers. Editors forbore to be angry at his delays, for, after a"
337,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"while of waiting, they got from him, at last, what none else could give"
338,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,at all.

342,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,About ten weeks before the darkness fell on him the little flame of his
343,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,life began visibly to flicker. A change to the country was advised; and
344,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,he became the carefully tended guest of Mr Wilfrid Blunt--not many
345,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"miles from the Storrington of his early love, to which, however, not"
346,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"wild arabs could any longer draw him. He was too weak for any travel,"
347,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"save that which brought him back to London--better, he himself said,"
348,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"but surely dying, as it seemed to solicitous eyes."
349,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,
350,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,Ten days before his death he went as a private patient to the Hospital
351,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"of St John and St Elizabeth, in St John's Wood, and there, at the age"
352,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"of forty-eight, on November 13, 1907, he passed away at dawn--the dawn"
353,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,that was the death-hour in his _Dream Tryst_. He was laid to rest in St
354,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"Mary's Cemetery, Kensal Green. In his coffin were roses from the garden"
355,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"of Mr George Meredith, inscribed with Mr Meredith's testimony, ""A true"
356,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"poet, one of the small band""; and violets from kindred turf went to the"
357,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,dead poet's breast from the hand of her whose praises he had divinely
358,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"sung. Devoted friends lament him, no less for himself than for his"
359,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"singing. He made all men his debtors, leaving to those who loved him"
360,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,"the memory of a unique personality, and to English poetry an"
361,A BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON,imperishable name.

425,DAISY,Where the thistle lifts a purple crown
426,DAISY,"Six foot out of the turf,"
427,DAISY,And the harebell shakes on the windy hill--
428,DAISY,O the breath of the distant surf!--
429,DAISY,
430,DAISY,"The hills look over on the South,"
431,DAISY,And southward dreams the sea;
432,DAISY,"And, with the sea-breeze hand in hand,"
433,DAISY,Came innocence and she.
434,DAISY,
435,DAISY,Where 'mid the gorse the raspberry
436,DAISY,"Red for the gatherer springs,"
437,DAISY,Two children did we stray and talk
438,DAISY,"Wise, idle, childish things."
439,DAISY,
440,DAISY,"She listened with big-lipped surprise,"
441,DAISY,Breast-deep 'mid flower and spine:
442,DAISY,"Her skin was like a grape, whose veins"
443,DAISY,Run snow instead of wine.
444,DAISY,
445,DAISY,"She knew not those sweet words she spake,"
446,DAISY,Nor knew her own sweet way;
447,DAISY,But there's never a bird so sweet a song
448,DAISY,Thronged in whose throat that day!
449,DAISY,
450,DAISY,"Oh, there were flowers in Storrington"
451,DAISY,On the turf and on the spray;
452,DAISY,But the sweetest flower on Sussex hills
453,DAISY,Was the Daisy-flower that day!
454,DAISY,
455,DAISY,Her beauty smoothed earth's furrowed face!
456,DAISY,She gave me tokens three:--
457,DAISY,"A look, a word of her winsome mouth,"
458,DAISY,And a wild raspberry.
459,DAISY,
460,DAISY,"A berry red, a guileless look,"
461,DAISY,"A still word,--strings of sand!"
462,DAISY,"And yet they made my wild, wild heart"
463,DAISY,Fly down to her little hand.
464,DAISY,
465,DAISY,"For, standing artless as the air,"
466,DAISY,"And candid as the skies,"
467,DAISY,"She took the berries with her hand,"
468,DAISY,And the love with her sweet eyes.
469,DAISY,
470,DAISY,The fairest things have fleetest end:
471,DAISY,"Their scent survives their close,"
472,DAISY,But the rose's scent is bitterness
473,DAISY,To him that loved the rose!
474,DAISY,
475,DAISY,"She looked a little wistfully,"
476,DAISY,Then went her sunshine way:--
477,DAISY,"The sea's eye had a mist on it,"
478,DAISY,And the leaves fell from the day.
479,DAISY,
480,DAISY,"She went her unremembering way,"
481,DAISY,"She went, and left in me"
482,DAISY,"The pang of all the partings gone,"
483,DAISY,And partings yet to be.
484,DAISY,
485,DAISY,She left me marvelling why my soul
486,DAISY,Was sad that she was glad;
487,DAISY,"At all the sadness in the sweet,"
488,DAISY,The sweetness in the sad.
489,DAISY,
490,DAISY,"Still, still I seemed to see her, still"
491,DAISY,"Look up with soft replies,"
492,DAISY,"And take the berries with her hand,"
493,DAISY,And the love with her lovely eyes.
494,DAISY,
495,DAISY,"Nothing begins, and nothing ends,"
496,DAISY,That is not paid with moan;
497,DAISY,"For we are born in others' pain,"
498,DAISY,And perish in our own.

505,THE POPPY,"Summer set lip to earth's bosom bare,"
506,THE POPPY,And left the flushed print in a poppy there:
507,THE POPPY,"Like a yawn of fire from the grass it came,"
508,THE POPPY,And the fanning wind puffed it to flapping flame.
509,THE POPPY,
510,THE POPPY,With burnt mouth red like a lion's it drank
511,THE POPPY,"The blood of the sun as he slaughtered sank,"
512,THE POPPY,And dipped its cup in the purpurate shine
513,THE POPPY,When the eastern conduits ran with wine;
514,THE POPPY,
515,THE POPPY,"Till it grew lethargied with fierce bliss,"
516,THE POPPY,"And hot as a swinkèd gipsy is,"
517,THE POPPY,"And drowsed in sleepy savageries,"
518,THE POPPY,With mouth wide a-pout for a sultry kiss.
519,THE POPPY,
520,THE POPPY,"A child and man paced side by side,"
521,THE POPPY,Treading the skirts of eventide;
522,THE POPPY,But between the clasp of his hand and hers
523,THE POPPY,"Lay, felt not, twenty withered years."
524,THE POPPY,
525,THE POPPY,"She turned, with the rout of her dusk South hair,"
526,THE POPPY,And saw the sleeping gipsy there;
527,THE POPPY,"And snatched and snapped it in swift child's whim,"
528,THE POPPY,"With--""Keep it, long as you live!""--to him."
529,THE POPPY,
530,THE POPPY,"And his smile, as nymphs from their laving meres,"
531,THE POPPY,Trembled up from a bath of tears;
532,THE POPPY,"And joy, like a mew sea-rocked apart,"
533,THE POPPY,Tossed on the wave of his troubled heart.
534,THE POPPY,
535,THE POPPY,"For _he_ saw what she did not see,"
536,THE POPPY,That--as kindled by its own fervency--
537,THE POPPY,The verge shrivelled inward smoulderingly:
538,THE POPPY,
539,THE POPPY,And suddenly 'twixt his hand and hers
540,THE POPPY,He knew the twenty withered years--
541,THE POPPY,"No flower, but twenty shrivelled years."
542,THE POPPY,
543,THE POPPY,"""Was never such thing until this hour,"""
544,THE POPPY,"Low to his heart he said; ""the flower"
545,THE POPPY,"Of sleep brings wakening to me,"
546,THE POPPY,And of oblivion memory.
547,THE POPPY,
548,THE POPPY,"""Was never this thing to me,"" he said,"
549,THE POPPY,"""Though with bruisèd poppies my feet are red!"""

552,THE POPPY,
553,THE POPPY,"""But you, who love nor know at all"
554,THE POPPY,"The diverse chambers in Love's guest-hall,"
555,THE POPPY,"Where some rise early, few sit long:"
556,THE POPPY,In how differing accents hear the throng
557,THE POPPY,His great Pentecostal tongue;
558,THE POPPY,
559,THE POPPY,"""Who know not love from amity,"
560,THE POPPY,Nor my reported self from me;
561,THE POPPY,"A fair fit gift is this, meseems,"
562,THE POPPY,You give--this withering flower of dreams.
563,THE POPPY,
564,THE POPPY,"""O frankly fickle, and fickly true,"
565,THE POPPY,Do you know what the days will do to you?
566,THE POPPY,"To your Love and you what the days will do,"
567,THE POPPY,"O frankly fickle, and fickly true?"
568,THE POPPY,
569,THE POPPY,"""You have loved me, Fair, three lives--or days:"
570,THE POPPY,'Twill pass with the passing of my face.

584,THE POPPY,"The sleep-flower sways in the wheat its head,"
585,THE POPPY,"Heavy with dreams, as that with bread:"
586,THE POPPY,The goodly grain and the sun-flushed sleeper
587,THE POPPY,"The reaper reaps, and Time the reaper."
588,THE POPPY,
589,THE POPPY,"I hang 'mid men my needless head,"
590,THE POPPY,"And my fruit is dreams, as theirs is bread:"
591,THE POPPY,The goodly men and the sun-hazed sleeper
592,THE POPPY,Time shall reap; but after the reaper
593,THE POPPY,"The world shall glean of me, me the sleeper!"
594,THE POPPY,
595,THE POPPY,"Love, love! your flower of withered dream"
596,THE POPPY,"In leavèd rhyme lies safe, I deem,"
597,THE POPPY,"Sheltered and shut in a nook of rhyme,"
598,THE POPPY,"From the reaper man, and his reaper Time."
599,THE POPPY,
600,THE POPPY,Love! _I_ fall into the claws of Time:

1034,A CHILD'S KISS,"And what unchildish days,"

1039,A CHILD'S KISS,And that shall never be;
1040,A CHILD'S KISS,"All vanished hopes, and all most hopeless bliss,"
1041,A CHILD'S KISS,Came with thee to my kiss.

1057,A CHILD'S KISS,"Then, that thy little kiss"

1146,THE OMEN,Stretched on the margin of the cruel sea
1147,THE OMEN,"Whence they had rescued me,"
1148,THE OMEN,With faint and painful pulses was I lying;
1149,THE OMEN,Not yet discerning well
1150,THE OMEN,"If I had 'scaped, or were an icicle,"

1177,THE OMEN,Of pain and fear thine eyes' young wonder shone.

1317,THE CHILD-WOMAN,"Till on gross things he dash his broken ray,"
1318,THE CHILD-WOMAN,From cloud and tree and flower re-tossed in prismy spray.
1319,THE CHILD-WOMAN,"Did not obstruction's vessel hem it in,"
1320,THE CHILD-WOMAN,"Force were not force, would spill itself in vain;"

1497,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,As gale to gale drifts breath
1498,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,"Of blossoms' death,"
1499,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,So dropping down the years from hour to hour

1502,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,"So, then, she looked (I say);"
1503,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,And so her front sunk down

1505,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,On her mouth museful sweet--
1506,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,(Even as the twin lips meet)
1507,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,Did thought and sadness greet:
1508,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,Sighs
1509,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,In those mournful eyes
1510,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,So put on visibilities;
1511,BEFORE HER PORTRAIT IN YOUTH,"As viewless ether turns, in deep on deep, to dyes."

1692,HER PORTRAIT,"So should her deathless beauty take no wrong,"
1693,HER PORTRAIT,Praised in her own great kindred's fit and cognate tongue.
1694,HER PORTRAIT,Or if that language yet with us abode
1695,HER PORTRAIT,Which Adam in the garden talked with God!
1696,HER PORTRAIT,But our untempered speech descends--poor heirs!
1697,HER PORTRAIT,Grimy and rough-cast still from Babel's bricklayers:
1698,HER PORTRAIT,"Curse on the brutish jargon we inherit,"
1699,HER PORTRAIT,"Strong but to damn, not memorise, a spirit!"
1700,HER PORTRAIT,"A cheek, a lip, a limb, a bosom, they"
1701,HER PORTRAIT,Move with light ease in speech of working-day;
1702,HER PORTRAIT,And women we do use to praise even so.
1703,HER PORTRAIT,"But here the gates we burst, and to the temple go."
1704,HER PORTRAIT,"Their praise were her dispraise; who dare, who dare,"
1705,HER PORTRAIT,Adulate the seraphim for their burning hair?
1706,HER PORTRAIT,"How, if with them I dared, here should I dare it?"
1707,HER PORTRAIT,"How praise the woman, who but know the spirit?"
1708,HER PORTRAIT,"How praise the colour of her eyes, uncaught"
1709,HER PORTRAIT,While they were coloured with her varying thought?
1710,HER PORTRAIT,"How her mouth's shape, who only use to know"
1711,HER PORTRAIT,What tender shape her speech will fit it to?
1712,HER PORTRAIT,"Or her lips' redness, when their joinèd veil"

1714,HER PORTRAIT,
1715,HER PORTRAIT,If I would praise her soul (temerarious if!)

1717,HER PORTRAIT,"Heaven, which not oft is prodigal of its more"
1718,HER PORTRAIT,"To singers, in their song too great before--"
1719,HER PORTRAIT,By which the hierarch of large poesy is
1720,HER PORTRAIT,Restrained to his one sacred benefice--

1722,HER PORTRAIT,Relaxes and stern canon of its law;
1723,HER PORTRAIT,"To her alone concedes pluralities,"
1724,HER PORTRAIT,In her alone to reconcile agrees
1725,HER PORTRAIT,"The Muse, the Graces, and the Charities;"
1726,HER PORTRAIT,"To her, who can the trust so well conduct,"

1730,HER PORTRAIT,"What of her daily gracious converse known,"
1731,HER PORTRAIT,Whose heavenly despotism must needs dethrone
1732,HER PORTRAIT,And subjugate all sweetness but its own?
1733,HER PORTRAIT,"Deep in my heart subsides the infrequent word,"
1734,HER PORTRAIT,And there dies slowly throbbing like a wounded bird.
1735,HER PORTRAIT,"What of her silence, that outsweetens speech?"
1736,HER PORTRAIT,"What of her thoughts, high marks for mine own thoughts to reach?"
1737,HER PORTRAIT,"Yet (Chaucer's antique sentence so to turn),"
1738,HER PORTRAIT,"Most gladly will she teach, and gladly learn;"
1739,HER PORTRAIT,"And teaching her, by her enchanting art,"
1740,HER PORTRAIT,The master threefold learns for all he can impart.
1741,HER PORTRAIT,"Now all is said, and all being said,--aye me!"
1742,HER PORTRAIT,There yet remains unsaid the very She.
1743,HER PORTRAIT,"Nay, to conclude (so to conclude I dare),"
1744,HER PORTRAIT,"If of her virtues you evade the snare,"
1745,HER PORTRAIT,Then for her faults you'll fall in love with her.
1746,HER PORTRAIT,
1747,HER PORTRAIT,"Alas, and I have spoken of her Muse--"
1748,HER PORTRAIT,"Her Muse, that died with her auroral dews!"
1749,HER PORTRAIT,"Learn, the wise cherubim from harps of gold"
1750,HER PORTRAIT,Seduce a trepidating music manifold;
1751,HER PORTRAIT,But the superior seraphim do know
1752,HER PORTRAIT,None other music but to flame and glow.
1753,HER PORTRAIT,"So she first lighted on our frosty earth,"
1754,HER PORTRAIT,"A sad musician, of cherubic birth,"
1755,HER PORTRAIT,Playing to alien ears--which did not prize
1756,HER PORTRAIT,The uncomprehended music of the skies--
1757,HER PORTRAIT,The exiled airs of her far Paradise.
1758,HER PORTRAIT,"But soon, from her own harpings taking fire,"
1759,HER PORTRAIT,In love and light her melodies expire.
1760,HER PORTRAIT,"Now Heaven affords her, for her silenced hymn,"
1761,HER PORTRAIT,A double portion of the seraphim.
1762,HER PORTRAIT,"At the rich odours from her heart that rise,"
1763,HER PORTRAIT,"My soul remembers its lost Paradise,"
1764,HER PORTRAIT,And antenatal gales blow from Heaven's shores of spice;
1765,HER PORTRAIT,"I grow essential all, uncloaking me"
1766,HER PORTRAIT,"From this encumbering virility,"
1767,HER PORTRAIT,And feel the primal sex of heaven and poetry:
1768,HER PORTRAIT,"And parting from her, in me linger on"
1769,HER PORTRAIT,Vague snatches of Uranian antiphon.
1770,HER PORTRAIT,
1771,HER PORTRAIT,How to the petty prison could she shrink
1772,HER PORTRAIT,"Of femineity?--Nay, but I think"
1773,HER PORTRAIT,In a dear courtesy her spirit would
1774,HER PORTRAIT,"Woman assume, for grace to womanhood."
1775,HER PORTRAIT,"Or, votaress to the virgin Sanctitude"
1776,HER PORTRAIT,"Of reticent withdrawal's sweet, courted pale,"
1777,HER PORTRAIT,"She took the cloistral flesh, the sexual veil,"
1778,HER PORTRAIT,"Of her sad, aboriginal sisterhood;"
1779,HER PORTRAIT,The habit of cloistral flesh which founding Eve indued.
1780,HER PORTRAIT,
1781,HER PORTRAIT,Thus do I know her: but for what men call
1782,HER PORTRAIT,"Beauty--the loveliness corporeal,"
1783,HER PORTRAIT,Its most just praise a thing unproper were
1784,HER PORTRAIT,"To singer or to listener, me or her."
1785,HER PORTRAIT,She wears that body but as one indues
1786,HER PORTRAIT,"A robe, half careless, for it is the use;"
1787,HER PORTRAIT,"Although her soul and it so fair agree,"
1788,HER PORTRAIT,"We sure may, unattaint of heresy,"
1789,HER PORTRAIT,Conceit it might the soul's begetter be.
1790,HER PORTRAIT,"The immortal could we cease to contemplate,"
1791,HER PORTRAIT,The mortal part suggests its every trait.
1792,HER PORTRAIT,God laid His fingers on the ivories
1793,HER PORTRAIT,"Of her pure members as on smoothèd keys,"
1794,HER PORTRAIT,And there out-breathed her spirit's harmonies.
1795,HER PORTRAIT,I'll speak a little proudly:--I disdain
1796,HER PORTRAIT,"To count the beauty worth my wish or gain,"
1797,HER PORTRAIT,Which the dull daily fool can covet or obtain.
1798,HER PORTRAIT,"I do confess the fairness of the spoil,"
1799,HER PORTRAIT,But from such rivalry it takes a soil.
1800,HER PORTRAIT,For her I'll proudlier speak:--how could it be
1801,HER PORTRAIT,That I should praise the gilding on the psaltery?
1802,HER PORTRAIT,"'Tis not for her to hold that prize a prize,"
1803,HER PORTRAIT,"Or praise much praise, though proudest in its wise,"
1804,HER PORTRAIT,To which even hopes of merely women rise.
1805,HER PORTRAIT,"Such strife would to the vanquished laurels yield,"
1806,HER PORTRAIT,Against _her_ suffered to have lost a field.
1807,HER PORTRAIT,"Herself must with herself be sole compeer,"
1808,HER PORTRAIT,Unless the people of her distant sphere
1809,HER PORTRAIT,Some gold migration send to melodise the year.
1810,HER PORTRAIT,
1811,HER PORTRAIT,Yet I have felt what terrors may consort
1812,HER PORTRAIT,"In women's cheeks, the Graces' soft resort;"
1813,HER PORTRAIT,"My hand hath shook at gentle hands' access,"

1815,HER PORTRAIT,"My blood known panic fear, and fled dismayed,"
1816,HER PORTRAIT,Where ladies' eyes have set their ambuscade.
1817,HER PORTRAIT,The rustle of a robe hath been to me
1818,HER PORTRAIT,The very rattle of love's musketry;
1819,HER PORTRAIT,"Although my heart hath beat the loud advance,"
1820,HER PORTRAIT,"I have recoiled before a challenging glance,"
1821,HER PORTRAIT,Proved gay alarms where warlike ribbons dance.
1822,HER PORTRAIT,"And from it all, this knowledge have I got,--"
1823,HER PORTRAIT,"The whole that others have, is less than they have not;"
1824,HER PORTRAIT,"All which makes other women noted fair,"
1825,HER PORTRAIT,Unnoted would remain and overshone in her.
1826,HER PORTRAIT,
1827,HER PORTRAIT,"How should I gauge what beauty is her dole,"
1828,HER PORTRAIT,"Who cannot see her countenance for her soul,"
1829,HER PORTRAIT,As birds see not the casement for the sky?
1830,HER PORTRAIT,"And, as 'tis check they prove its presence by,"
1831,HER PORTRAIT,I know not of her body till I find
1832,HER PORTRAIT,My flight debarred the heaven of her mind.
1833,HER PORTRAIT,"Hers is the face whence all should copied be,"
1834,HER PORTRAIT,Did God make replicas of such as she;
1835,HER PORTRAIT,"Its presence felt by what it does abate,"
1836,HER PORTRAIT,Because the soul shines through tempered and mitigate:
1837,HER PORTRAIT,Where--as a figure labouring at night
1838,HER PORTRAIT,Beside the body of a splendid light--
1839,HER PORTRAIT,Dark Time works hidden by its luminousness;
1840,HER PORTRAIT,And every line he labours to impress
1841,HER PORTRAIT,"Turns added beauty, like the veins that run"
1842,HER PORTRAIT,Athwart a leaf which hangs against the sun.
1843,HER PORTRAIT,
1844,HER PORTRAIT,There regent Melancholy wide controls;
1845,HER PORTRAIT,There Earth-and Heaven-Love play for aureoles;
1846,HER PORTRAIT,"There Sweetness out of Sadness breaks at fits,"
1847,HER PORTRAIT,"Like bubbles on dark water, or as flits"
1848,HER PORTRAIT,A sudden silver fin through its deep infinites;
1849,HER PORTRAIT,"There amorous Thought has sucked pale Fancy's breath,"
1850,HER PORTRAIT,And Tenderness sits looking towards the lands of death;
1851,HER PORTRAIT,"There Feeling stills her breathing with her hand,"
1852,HER PORTRAIT,And Dream from Melancholy part wrests the wand
1853,HER PORTRAIT,"And on this lady's heart, looked you so deep,"
1854,HER PORTRAIT,Poor Poetry has rocked himself to sleep:
1855,HER PORTRAIT,Upon the heavy blossom of her lips
1856,HER PORTRAIT,"Hangs the bee Musing; nigh, her lids eclipse"
1857,HER PORTRAIT,Each half-occulted star beneath that lies;
1858,HER PORTRAIT,"And in the contemplation of those eyes,"

1963,A FALLEN YEW,
1964,A FALLEN YEW,"It seemed corrival of the world's great prime,"
1965,A FALLEN YEW,"Made to un-edge the scythe of Time,"
1966,A FALLEN YEW,And last with stateliest rhyme.
1967,A FALLEN YEW,
1968,A FALLEN YEW,No tender Dryad ever did indue
1969,A FALLEN YEW,"That rigid chiton of rough yew,"
1970,A FALLEN YEW,To fret her white flesh through:
1971,A FALLEN YEW,
1972,A FALLEN YEW,"But some god, like to those grim Asgard lords"
1973,A FALLEN YEW,Who walk the fables of the hordes
1974,A FALLEN YEW,"From Scandinavian fjords,"
1975,A FALLEN YEW,
1976,A FALLEN YEW,"Upheaved its stubborn girth, and raised unriven,"
1977,A FALLEN YEW,"Against the whirl-blast and the levin,"
1978,A FALLEN YEW,Defiant arms to Heaven.
1979,A FALLEN YEW,
1980,A FALLEN YEW,"When doom puffed out the stars, we might have said,"
1981,A FALLEN YEW,"It would decline its heavy head,"
1982,A FALLEN YEW,And see the world to bed.
1983,A FALLEN YEW,
1984,A FALLEN YEW,"For this firm yew did from the vassal leas,"
1985,A FALLEN YEW,"And rain and air, its tributaries,"
1986,A FALLEN YEW,"Its revenues increase,"
1987,A FALLEN YEW,
1988,A FALLEN YEW,"And levy impost on the golden sun,"
1989,A FALLEN YEW,"Take the blind years as they might run,"
1990,A FALLEN YEW,And no fate seek or shun.
1991,A FALLEN YEW,
1992,A FALLEN YEW,"But now our yew is strook, is fallen--yea"
1993,A FALLEN YEW,Hacked like dull wood of every day
1994,A FALLEN YEW,"To this and that, men say."
1995,A FALLEN YEW,
1996,A FALLEN YEW,"Never!--To Hades' shadowy shipyards gone,"

1998,A FALLEN YEW,"It drops, or Lethe wan."
1999,A FALLEN YEW,
2000,A FALLEN YEW,Stirred by its fall--poor destined bark of Dis!--
2001,A FALLEN YEW,Along my soul a bruit there is
2002,A FALLEN YEW,"Of echoing images,"
2003,A FALLEN YEW,
2004,A FALLEN YEW,Reverberations of mortality:
2005,A FALLEN YEW,"Spelt backward from its death, to me"
2006,A FALLEN YEW,Its life reads saddenedly.
2007,A FALLEN YEW,
2008,A FALLEN YEW,Its breast was hollowed as the tooth of eld;
2009,A FALLEN YEW,"And boys, there creeping unbeheld,"
2010,A FALLEN YEW,A laughing moment dwelled.
2011,A FALLEN YEW,
2012,A FALLEN YEW,"Yet they, within its very heart so crept,"
2013,A FALLEN YEW,Reached not the heart that courage kept
2014,A FALLEN YEW,With winds and years beswept.
2015,A FALLEN YEW,
2016,A FALLEN YEW,And in its boughs did close and kindly nest
2017,A FALLEN YEW,"The birds, as they within its breast,"
2018,A FALLEN YEW,By all its leaves caressed.
2019,A FALLEN YEW,
2020,A FALLEN YEW,But bird nor child might touch by any art
2021,A FALLEN YEW,"Each other's or the tree's hid heart,"
2022,A FALLEN YEW,A whole God's breadth apart;
2023,A FALLEN YEW,
2024,A FALLEN YEW,"The breadth of God, the breadth of death and life!"
2025,A FALLEN YEW,"Even so, even so, in undreamed strife"
2026,A FALLEN YEW,"With pulseless Law, the wife,--"
2027,A FALLEN YEW,
2028,A FALLEN YEW,"The sweetest wife on sweetest marriage-day,--"
2029,A FALLEN YEW,"Their soul at grapple in mid-way,"
2030,A FALLEN YEW,Sweet to her sweet may say:
2031,A FALLEN YEW,
2032,A FALLEN YEW,"""I take you to my inmost heart, my true!"""
2033,A FALLEN YEW,"Ah, fool! but there is one heart you"
2034,A FALLEN YEW,Shall never take him to!
2035,A FALLEN YEW,
2036,A FALLEN YEW,"The hold that falls not when the town is got,"
2037,A FALLEN YEW,"The heart's heart, whose immurèd plot"
2038,A FALLEN YEW,Hath keys yourself keep not!
2039,A FALLEN YEW,
2040,A FALLEN YEW,Its ports you cannot burst--you are withstood--
2041,A FALLEN YEW,For him that to your listening blood
2042,A FALLEN YEW,Sends precepts as he would.
2043,A FALLEN YEW,
2044,A FALLEN YEW,"Its gates are deaf to Love, high summoner;"
2045,A FALLEN YEW,"Yea, Love's great warrant runs not there:"
2046,A FALLEN YEW,You are your prisoner.
2047,A FALLEN YEW,
2048,A FALLEN YEW,Yourself are with yourself the sole consortress
2049,A FALLEN YEW,In that unleaguerable fortress;
2050,A FALLEN YEW,It knows you not for portress.
2051,A FALLEN YEW,
2052,A FALLEN YEW,Its keys are at the cincture hung of God;
2053,A FALLEN YEW,Its gates are trepidant to His nod;
2054,A FALLEN YEW,By Him its floors are trod.
2055,A FALLEN YEW,
2056,A FALLEN YEW,"And if His feet shall rock those floors in wrath,"
2057,A FALLEN YEW,"Or blest aspersion sleek His path,"
2058,A FALLEN YEW,Is only choice it hath.
2059,A FALLEN YEW,
2060,A FALLEN YEW,"Yea, in that ultimate heart's occult abode"
2061,A FALLEN YEW,To lie as in an oubliette of God;
2062,A FALLEN YEW,"Or in a bower untrod,"
2063,A FALLEN YEW,
2064,A FALLEN YEW,Built by a secret Lover for His Spouse;--
2065,A FALLEN YEW,"Sole choice is this your life allows,"
2066,A FALLEN YEW,"Sad tree, whose perishing boughs"
2067,A FALLEN YEW,So few birds house!

2071,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,
2072,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I fled Him, down the nights and down the days;"
2073,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I fled Him down the arches of the years;
2074,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways"
2075,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Of my own mind; and in the mist of tears
2076,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I hid from Him, and under running laughter."
2077,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Up vistaed hopes I sped;
2078,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And shot, precipitated,"
2079,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Adown Titanic glooms of chasmèd fears,"
2080,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"From those strong Feet that followed, followed after."
2081,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"But with unhurrying chase,"
2082,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And unperturbèd pace,"
2083,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,"
2084,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,They beat--and a Voice beat
2085,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,More instant than the Feet--
2086,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"""All things betray thee, who betrayest Me."""
2087,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,
2088,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I pleaded, outlaw-wise,"
2089,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"By many a hearted casement, curtained red,"
2090,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Trellised with intertwining charities;
2091,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"(For, though I knew His love Who followèd,"
2092,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Yet was I sore adread
2093,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Lest, having Him, I must have naught beside);"
2094,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"But, if one little casement parted wide,"
2095,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,The gust of His approach would clash it to.
2096,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Fear wist not to evade, as Love wist to pursue."
2097,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Across the margent of the world I fled,"
2098,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And troubled the gold gateways of the stars,"
2099,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Smiting for shelter on their clangèd bars;
2100,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Fretted to dulcet jars
2101,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And silvern chatter the pale ports o' the moon.
2102,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I said to dawn, Be sudden; to eve, Be soon;"
2103,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,With thy young skiey blossoms heap me over
2104,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,From this tremendous Lover!
2105,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Float thy vague veil about me, lest He see!"
2106,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I tempted all His servitors, but to find"
2107,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"My own betrayal in their constancy,"
2108,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"In faith to Him their fickleness to me,"
2109,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Their traitorous trueness, and their loyal deceit."
2110,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,To all swift things for swiftness did I sue;
2111,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Clung to the whistling mane of every wind.
2112,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"But whether they swept, smoothly fleet,"
2113,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,The long savannahs of the blue;
2114,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Or whether, Thunder-driven,"
2115,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,They clanged his chariot 'thwart a heaven
2116,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn o' their feet:--
2117,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.
2118,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Still with unhurrying chase,"
2119,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And unperturbèd pace,"
2120,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,"
2121,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Came on the following Feet,"
2122,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And a Voice above their beat--
2123,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"""Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me."""
2124,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,
2125,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I sought no more that after which I strayed
2126,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,In face of man or maid;
2127,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,But still within the little children's eyes
2128,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Seems something, something that replies;"
2129,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"_They_ at least are for me, surely for me!"
2130,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I turned me to them very wistfully;
2131,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"But, just as their young eyes grew sudden fair"
2132,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With dawning answers there,"
2133,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.
2134,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"""Come then, ye other children, Nature's--share"
2135,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With me"" (said I) ""your delicate fellowship;"
2136,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Let me greet you lip to lip,"
2137,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Let me twine with you caresses,"
2138,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Wantoning
2139,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With our Lady-Mother's vagrant tresses,"
2140,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Banqueting
2141,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With her in her wind-walled palace,"
2142,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Underneath her azured daïs,"
2143,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Quaffing, as your taintless way is,"
2144,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,From a chalice
2145,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Lucent-weeping out of the dayspring."""
2146,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,So it was done:
2147,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,_I_ in their delicate fellowship was one--
2148,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Drew the bolt of Nature's secrecies.
2149,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,_I_ knew all the swift importings
2150,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,On the wilful face of skies;
2151,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I knew how the clouds arise
2152,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Spumèd of the wild sea-snortings;
2153,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,All that's born or dies
2154,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Rose and drooped with--made them shapers
2155,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Of mine own moods, or wailful or divine--"
2156,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,With them joyed and was bereaven.
2157,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I was heavy with the even,"
2158,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,When she lit her glimmering tapers
2159,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Round the day's dead sanctities.
2160,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I laughed in the morning's eyes.
2161,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I triumphed and I saddened with all weather,"
2162,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Heaven and I wept together,"
2163,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine;
2164,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Against the red throb of its sunset-heart
2165,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I laid my own to beat,"
2166,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And share commingling heat;
2167,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"But not by that, by that, was eased my human smart."
2168,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,In vain my tears were wet on Heaven's grey cheek.
2169,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"For ah! we know not what each other says,"
2170,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,These things and I; in sound _I_ speak--
2171,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"_Their_ sound is but their stir, they speak by silences."
2172,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Nature, poor stepdame, cannot slake my drouth;"
2173,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Let her, if she would owe me,"
2174,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Drop yon blue bosom-veil of sky, and show me"
2175,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,The breasts o' her tenderness:
2176,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Never did any milk of hers once bless
2177,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,My thirsting mouth.
2178,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Nigh and nigh draws the chase,"
2179,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With unperturbèd pace,"
2180,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Deliberate speed, majestic instancy;"
2181,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And past those noisèd Feet
2182,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,A voice comes yet more fleet--
2183,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"""Lo! naught contents thee, who content'st not Me."""
2184,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,
2185,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Naked I wait Thy love's uplifted stroke!
2186,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"My harness piece by piece Thou hast hewn from me,"
2187,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,And smitten me to my knee;
2188,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I am defenceless utterly.
2189,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I slept, methinks, and woke,"
2190,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And, slowly gazing, find me stripped in sleep."
2191,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"In the rash lustihead of my young powers,"
2192,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I shook the pillaring hours
2193,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And pulled my life upon me; grimed with smears,"
2194,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,_I_ stand amid the dust o' the mounded years--
2195,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap.
2196,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,"
2197,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream.
2198,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Yea, faileth now even dream"
2199,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"The dreamer, and the lute the lutanist;"
2200,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Even the linked fantasies, in whose blossomy twist"
2201,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I swung the earth a trinket at my wrist,"
2202,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Are yielding; cords of all too weak account
2203,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,For earth with heavy griefs so overplussed.
2204,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Ah! is Thy love indeed
2205,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"A weed, albeit an amaranthine weed,"
2206,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Suffering no flowers except its own to mount?
2207,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Ah! must--
2208,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Designer infinite!--
2209,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Ah! must Thou char the wood ere Thou canst limn with it?
2210,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,My freshness spent its wavering shower i' the dust;
2211,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"And now my heart is as a broken fount,"
2212,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down ever"
2213,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,From the dank thoughts that shiver
2214,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Upon the sighful branches of my mind.
2215,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Such is; what is to be?
2216,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind?"
2217,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds;
2218,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Yet ever and anon a trumpet sounds
2219,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,From the hid battlements of Eternity;
2220,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Those shaken mists a space unsettle, then"
2221,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Round the half-glimpsèd turrets slowly wash again.
2222,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,But not ere him who summoneth
2223,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"I first have seen, enwound"
2224,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"With glooming robes purpureal, cypress-crowned;"
2225,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"His name I know, and what his trumpet saith."
2226,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Whether man's heart or life it be which yields
2227,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Thee harvest, must Thy harvest fields"
2228,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Be dunged with rotten death?
2229,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,
2230,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Now of that long pursuit
2231,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Comes on at hand the bruit;
2232,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,That Voice is round me like a bursting sea:
2233,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"""And is thy earth so marred,"
2234,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Shattered in shard on shard?
2235,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest Me!"
2236,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Strange, piteous, futile thing,"
2237,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Wherefore should any set thee love apart?
2238,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Seeing none but I makes much of naught"" (He said),"
2239,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"""And human love needs human meriting:"
2240,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,How hast thou merited--
2241,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Of all man's clotted clay the dingiest clot?
2242,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Alack, thou knowest not"
2243,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,How little worthy of any love thou art!
2244,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee
2245,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Save Me, save only Me?"
2246,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"All which I took from thee I did but take,"
2247,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Not for thy harms,"
2248,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,But just that thou might'st seek it in My arms.
2249,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,All which thy child's mistake
2250,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Fancies as lost, I have stored for thee at home:"
2251,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Rise, clasp My hand, and come!"""
2252,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,
2253,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,Halts by me that footfall:
2254,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Is my gloom, after all,"
2255,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Shade of His hand, outstretched caressingly?"
2256,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"""Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest,"
2257,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,I am He Whom thou seekest!
2258,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,"Thou dravest love from thee, who dravest Me."""
2259,THE HOUND OF HEAVEN,

2262,TO THE DEAD CARDINAL OF WESTMINSTER,

2561,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Through the flashing bars of July,"
2562,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Waiting thy ripened golden shower;

2572,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,That stain Favonian firmament;
2573,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Richer than ever the Occident
2574,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Gave up to bygone Summer's wand.
2575,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Day's dying dragon lies drooping his crest,"
2576,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Panting red pants into the West.
2577,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Or a butterfly sunset claps its wings
2578,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"With flitter alit on the swinging blossom,"
2579,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"The gusty blossom, that tosses and swings,"
2580,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Of the sea with its blown and ruffled bosom;
2581,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Its ruffled bosom wherethrough the wind sings
2582,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Till the crispèd petals are loosened and strown
2583,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Overblown on the sand;

2590,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"In tones of floating and mellow light,"
2591,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,A spreading summons to even-song:
2592,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,See how there
2593,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,The cowlèd Night
2594,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Kneels on the Eastern sanctuary-stair.
2595,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,What is this feel of incense everywhere?
2596,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Clings it round folds of the blanch-amiced clouds,"
2597,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Upwafted by the solemn thurifer,"
2598,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"The mighty Spirit unknown,"
2599,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,That swingeth the slow earth before the embannered
2600,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Throne?
2601,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Or is't the Season, under all these shrouds"
2602,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Of light, and sense, and silence, makes her known"
2603,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"A presence everywhere,"
2604,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"An inarticulate prayer,"
2605,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,A hand on the soothed tresses of the air?
2606,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,But there is one hour scant
2607,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Of this Titanian, primal liturgy,--"
2608,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"As there is but one hour for me and thee,"
2609,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Autumn, for thee and thine hierophant,"
2610,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Of this grave ending chant.
2611,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Round the earth still and stark
2612,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Heaven's death-lights kindle, yellow spark by spark,"
2613,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Beneath the dreadful catafalque of the dark.
2614,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,
2615,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,And I had ended there:
2616,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"But a great wind blew all the stars to flare,"
2617,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"And cried, ""I sweep a path before the moon!"
2618,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Tarry ye now the coming of the moon,"
2619,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"For she is coming soon"";"
2620,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Then died before the coming of the moon.
2621,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"And she came forth upon the trepidant air,"
2622,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"In vesture unimagined-fair,"
2623,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Woven as woof of flag-lilies;
2624,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"And, curdled as of flag-lilies,"
2625,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,The vapour at the feet of her;
2626,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,And a haze about her tinged in fainter wise;
2627,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"As if she had trodden the stars in press,"
2628,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Till the gold wine spurted over her dress,"
2629,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Till the gold wine gushed out round her feet;
2630,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Spouted over her stainèd wear,"
2631,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"And bubbled in golden froth at her feet,"
2632,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,And hung like a whirlpool's mist round her.
2633,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,
2634,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Still, mighty Season, do I see't,"
2635,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Thy sway is still majestical!
2636,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Thou hold'st of God, by title sure,"
2637,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Thine indefeasible investiture,"
2638,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,And that right round thy locks are native to;
2639,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"The heavens upon thy brow imperial,"
2640,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"This huge terrene thy ball,"
2641,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,And o'er thy shoulders thrown wide air's depending pall.
2642,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,What if thine earth be blear and bleak of hue?
2643,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Still, still the skies are sweet!"
2644,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Still, Season, still thou hast thy triumphs there!"
2645,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"How have I, unaware,"
2646,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Forgetful of my strain inaugural,"
2647,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Cleft the great rondure of thy reign complete,"
2648,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Yielding thee half, who hast indeed the all?"
2649,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,I will not think thy sovereignty begun
2650,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,But with the shepherd Sun
2651,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,That washes in the sea the stars' gold fleeces;
2652,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Or that with Day it ceases,"
2653,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Who sets his burning lips to the salt brine,"
2654,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,And purples it to wine;
2655,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,While I behold how ermined Artemis
2656,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Ordainèd weed must wear,"
2657,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,And toil thy business;
2658,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"Who witness am of her,"
2659,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,Her too in Autumn turned a vintager;
2660,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,"And, laden with its lampèd clusters bright,"
2661,A CORYMBUS FOR AUTUMN,The fiery-fruited vineyard of this night.

3099,ODE,Whatso looks lovelily

3114,ODE,"O blessèd Sun, thy state"
3115,ODE,Uprisen or derogate
3116,ODE,Dafts me no more with doubt; I seek and find.
3117,ODE,

3130,ODE,"Yet lift once more Its light,"
3131,ODE,"And, risen, again departed from our ball,"
3132,ODE,But when It set on earth arose in Heaven.

3134,ODE,And so of all which form inheriteth
3135,ODE,The fall doth pass the rise in worth;

3425,ORIENT ODE,"Not unto thee, great Image, not to thee"

3427,ORIENT ODE,And in an age of faith grown frore
3428,ORIENT ODE,"If I too shall adore,"
3429,ORIENT ODE,"Be it accounted unto me,"
3430,ORIENT ODE,A bright sciential idolatry!
3431,ORIENT ODE,God has given thee visible thunders

3456,ORIENT ODE,"Destroyer and preserver, thou"

4749,ENVOY,"_""Such pronouncements proved at least that a poet, who had"
4750,ENVOY,"no friend save such as his published poems gained for him,"
4751,ENVOY,could count on an immediate recognition for high merit. For
4752,ENVOY,"these tributes, and many more of like welcoming, placed him"
4753,ENVOY,instantly out of range of the common casualties of
4754,ENVOY,"criticism.""--From the_ ""NOTE ON FRANCIS THOMPSON"" (p. xii)."
4755,ENVOY,"_As the writer of the ""Note"" has not attempted a critical"
4756,ENVOY,"estimate of the poetry, some of these Appreciations, forming"
4757,ENVOY,a part of the poet's life-history and even of the literary
4758,ENVOY,"history of his time, are here reproduced._"
4759,ENVOY,
4760,ENVOY,Mr Francis Thompson is a writer whom it is impossible that any
4761,ENVOY,"qualified judge should deny to be a ""new poet."" And while most poets of"
4762,ENVOY,his quality have usually to wait a quarter of a century or more for
4763,ENVOY,"adequate recognition, this poet is pretty sure of a wide and immediate"
4764,ENVOY,"acknowledgement.... We find that in these poems profound thought,"
4765,ENVOY,"far-fetched splendour of imagery, and nimble-witted discernment of"
4766,ENVOY,"those analogies which are the roots of the poet's language, abound ..."
4767,ENVOY,"qualities which ought to place him in the permanent ranks of fame, with"
4768,ENVOY,COWLEY and with CRASHAW.... _The Hound of Heaven_ has so great and
4769,ENVOY,"passionate and such a metre-creating motive, that we are carried over"
4770,ENVOY,"all obstructions of the rhythmical current, and are compelled to"
4771,ENVOY,"pronounce it, at the end, one of the very few ""great"" odes of which the"
4772,ENVOY,language can boast. In a lesser degree this metre-making passion
4773,ENVOY,"prevails in the seven remarkable pieces called _Love in Dian's Lap_,"
4774,ENVOY,"poems of which LAURA might have been proud, and LUCRETIA not ashamed,"
4775,ENVOY,to have had addressed to her. The main region of MR THOMPSON'S poetry
4776,ENVOY,is the inexhaustible and hitherto almost unworked mine of Catholic
4777,ENVOY,philosophy. Not but that he knows better than to make his religion the
4778,ENVOY,"direct subject of any of his poems, unless it presents itself to him as"
4779,ENVOY,"a human passion, and the most human of passions, as it does in the"
4780,ENVOY,"splendid ode just noticed, in which God's long pursuit and final"
4781,ENVOY,conquest of the resisting soul is described in a torrent of as humanly
4782,ENVOY,impressive verse as was ever inspired by a natural affection. MR
4783,ENVOY,"THOMPSON places himself, by these poems, in the front rank of the"
4784,ENVOY,"pioneers of the movement which, if it be not checked, as in the history"
4785,ENVOY,"of the world it has once or twice been checked before, by premature"
4786,ENVOY,"formulation and by popular and profane perversion, must end in creating"
4787,ENVOY,"a ""new heaven and a new earth.""--COVENTRY PATMORE, in _The Fortnightly"
4788,ENVOY,Review._
4789,ENVOY,
4790,ENVOY,
4791,ENVOY,It is not only the religious ecstasy of CRASHAW that they recall; for
4792,ENVOY,"all the daringly fantastic imagery, all the love-lyrical hyperbole, all"
4793,ENVOY,"that strange mixture and artifice, of spontaneous passion and studied"
4794,ENVOY,"conceit, which were so characteristic of the age of CRASHAW, are with"
4795,ENVOY,"the same astonishing fidelity reproduced. Where, unless, perhaps, in"
4796,ENVOY,"here and there a sonnet of ROSSETTI'S, has this sort of sublimated"
4797,ENVOY,enthusiasm for the bodily and spiritual beauty of womanhood found such
4798,ENVOY,expression as in _Love in Dian's Lap_ between the age of the Stuarts
4799,ENVOY,"and our own? To realize the full extent to which the religious, or"
4800,ENVOY,"semi-religious, emotions--now ecstatic, now awe-stricken--dominate and"
4801,ENVOY,"colour the entire fabric of these strange poems, they must be read"
4802,ENVOY,throughout. In the lines _To the Dead Cardinal of Westminster_ we see
4803,ENVOY,"them at their subtlest; and in the very powerful piece, _The Hound of"
4804,ENVOY,Heaven_--a poem setting forth the pursuit of the human soul by divine
4805,ENVOY,grace--they are at their most intense.... That minority who can
4806,ENVOY,"recognize the essentials under the accidents of poetry, and who feel"
4807,ENVOY,"that it is to poetic Form alone, and not to forms, that eternity"
4808,ENVOY,"belongs, will agree that, alike in wealth and dignity of imagination,"
4809,ENVOY,"in depth and subtlety of thought, and in magic and mastery of language,"
4810,ENVOY,a new poet of the first rank is to be welcomed in the author of this
4811,ENVOY,"volume.--H. D. TRAILL, in _The Nineteenth Century_."
4812,ENVOY,
4813,ENVOY,
4814,ENVOY,"The first thing to be done, and by far the most important, is to"
4815,ENVOY,"recognize that we are here face to face with a poet of the first order,"
4816,ENVOY,"a man of imagination all compact, a seer and singer of rare genius. He"
4817,ENVOY,"revels indeed in ""orgiac imageries,"" and revelry implies excess. But"
4818,ENVOY,"when excess is an excess of strength, the debauch a debauch of beauty,"
4819,ENVOY,who can condemn or even regret it? Would we had a few more poets who
4820,ENVOY,could exceed in such imagery as this! It is no minor Caroline singer he
4821,ENVOY,"recalls, but the Jacobean SHAKESPEARE.--_The Daily Chronicle._"
4822,ENVOY,
4823,ENVOY,
4824,ENVOY,A volume of poetry has not appeared in QUEEN VICTORIA'S reign more
4825,ENVOY,authentic in greatness of utterance than this. In the rich and virile
4826,ENVOY,"harmonies of his line, in strange and lovely vision, in fundamental"
4827,ENVOY,"meaning, he is possibly the first of Victorian poets, and at least is"
4828,ENVOY,he of none the inferior.... In all sobriety do we believe him of all
4829,ENVOY,"poets to be the most celestial in vision, the most august in"
4830,ENVOY,"faculty.... In a word, a new planet has swum into the ken of the"
4831,ENVOY,watchers of the poetic skies. These are big words; but we have weighed
4832,ENVOY,them. For there is that in Mr FRANCIS THOMPSON'S poetry which
4833,ENVOY,discourages the flamboyant appreciations of the more facile
4834,ENVOY,"impressionist, and gives him pause in his ready-made enthusiasms. It is"
4835,ENVOY,"patent on the first page that there is genius in this inspiration, and"
4836,ENVOY,the great note in this utterance; but page after page reveals the rich
4837,ENVOY,"and the strange, and the richer and the stranger in so many original"
4838,ENVOY,"moods and noble measures, that the reviewer feels the necessity of"
4839,ENVOY,caution.... In nothing does THOMPSON appear more authentically a poet
4840,ENVOY,than in the fact that his sense of beauty is part of his religion. In
4841,ENVOY,"this he is like SHELLEY, except that SHELLEY'S sense of beauty was his"
4842,ENVOY,"religion, and lived in an atmosphere of sensuousness, a sensuousness"
4843,ENVOY,"that has little of the grosser taints of earth about it indeed, but"
4844,ENVOY,"which is still sensuousness. Therefore, SHELLEY wrote the glorious"
4845,ENVOY,"_Epipsychidion_; therefore, Mr THOMPSON writes _Her Portrait_, the"
4846,ENVOY,"longest and greatest poem in his book; and, speaking for ourselves, we"
4847,ENVOY,"shall say at once that _Epipsychidion_, long unique in the language,"
4848,ENVOY,"has at last found its parallel, perhaps its peer, in _Her Portrait_. Of"
4849,ENVOY,"this ""Her"" of Mr THOMPSON'S we must say that she is the significance of"
4850,ENVOY,"his book. If his sense of beauty is part of his religion, his religion"
4851,ENVOY,"is that of a rapt Catholic, to whom the very heaven, with all that"
4852,ENVOY,"therein be, is open and palpable; his is the Catholicism of profound"
4853,ENVOY,"mysticism, and of the most universal temper.... It is perfectly safe to"
4854,ENVOY,"affirm that if Mr THOMPSON write no other line, by this volume alone he"
4855,ENVOY,is as secure of remembrance as any poet of the century. His vocabulary
4856,ENVOY,is very great.... Mr THOMPSON'S first volume is no mere promise--it is
4857,ENVOY,itself among the great achievements of English poetry; it has reached
4858,ENVOY,the peak of Parnassus at a bound.
4859,ENVOY,
4860,ENVOY,He has actually accomplished the high thing in metaphysical poetry that
4861,ENVOY,DONNE and CRASHAW only dreamed of. His mysticism is infinitely more
4862,ENVOY,"profound and significant than theirs, as his imagination is more"
4863,ENVOY,"impulsive, ardent, and beautiful. He is the great Platonist of English"
4864,ENVOY,poetry. If Mr THOMPSON had never written anything after his first
4865,ENVOY,"volume, there would be but one Stuart poet with whom the author of _Her"
4866,ENVOY,"Portrait_ could be compared for orchestral majesties of song, and that"
4867,ENVOY,"one MILTON.... He is an argonaut of literature, far travelled in the"
4868,ENVOY,"realms of gold, and he has in a strange degree the assimilative"
4869,ENVOY,mind.... We do not think we forget any of the splendid things of an
4870,ENVOY,"English anthology when we say that _The Hound of Heaven_ seems to us,"
4871,ENVOY,"on the whole, the most wonderful lyric in the language. It fingers all"
4872,ENVOY,"the stops of the spirit, and we hear now a thrilling and dolorous note"
4873,ENVOY,"of doom, and now the quiring of the spheres, and now the very pipes of"
4874,ENVOY,"Pan, but under all the still, sad music of humanity. It is the return"
4875,ENVOY,"of the nineteenth century to THOMAS A KEMPIS.--J. L. GARVIN, in _The"
4876,ENVOY,Newcastle Chronicle_ and in _The Bookman_.
4877,ENVOY,
4878,ENVOY,
4879,ENVOY,"The fine frenzy, and the fine line: these are two root characteristics"
4880,ENVOY,of Mr THOMPSON'S really remarkable poem. One has seldom seen poet more
4881,ENVOY,"wildly abandoned to his rapture, more absorbed in the trance of his"
4882,ENVOY,"ecstasy. When the irresistible moment comes, he throws himself upon his"
4883,ENVOY,"mood as a glad swimmer gives himself to the waves, careless whither the"
4884,ENVOY,"strong tide carries him, knowing only the wild joy of the laughing"
4885,ENVOY,"waters and the rainbow spray. He shouts, as it were, for mere gladness,"
4886,ENVOY,"in the welter of wonderful words, and he dives swift and fearless to"
4887,ENVOY,fetch his deep-sea fancies. When weak men venture on these vagaries
4888,ENVOY,"they drown; but Mr THOMPSON is a strong swimmer. Hyperboles, which in"
4889,ENVOY,"other hands had seemed merely absurd, in his delight us as examples of"
4890,ENVOY,"that ""fine excess"" which is one of the most enthralling of the many"
4891,ENVOY,"enchantments of poetry.... Indeed, Mr THOMPSON must simply be CRASHAW"
4892,ENVOY,"born again, but born greater. Though the conception, for example, of"
4893,ENVOY,_The Hound of Heaven_--the case of a sinner fleeing from the love of
4894,ENVOY,"Christ--is exactly in CRASHAW'S vein, yet it was not in his power to"
4895,ENVOY,have suggested such tremendous speed and terror of flight as whirls
4896,ENVOY,"through every line of Mr THOMPSON'S poem.--R. LE GALLIENNE, in _The"
4897,ENVOY,Daily Chronicle_.
4898,ENVOY,
4899,ENVOY,
4900,ENVOY,A new poet--and this time a major and not a minor one. On the section
4901,ENVOY,"called _Love in Dian's Lap_, much might be said of its extraordinary"
4902,ENVOY,"conception and workmanship. The section is one long, beautiful song of"
4903,ENVOY,"praise, and even worship, of one whom the poet calls his ""dear"
4904,ENVOY,"administress."" But surely never was woman worshipped with more utter"
4905,ENVOY,"chastity of passion. Whether _Before her Portrait in Youth_, or"
4906,ENVOY,"regarding her as _A poet breaking silence_, or only reflecting on her"
4907,ENVOY,"wearing of a new dress, the Poet is so full of fine matter and so"
4908,ENVOY,"adoring in his expression of it, as to bring DANTE himself to"
4909,ENVOY,mind.--_St. James's Gazette._
4910,ENVOY,
4911,ENVOY,
4912,ENVOY,"Here are dominion--domination over language, and a sincerity as of"
4913,ENVOY,Robert Burns.... The epithet sublime has been sadly stained and
4914,ENVOY,"distorted by comic writers, and there is a danger in applying it in its"
4915,ENVOY,"honest light without warning. This safeguard established, we have to"
4916,ENVOY,say that in our opinion Mr THOMPSON'S poetry at its highest attains a
4917,ENVOY,sublimity unsurpassed by any Victorian poet--a sublimity which will
4918,ENVOY,stand the hideous test of extracts. In _Her Portrait_ a constant
4919,ENVOY,interchange of symbol between earthly and heavenly beauty pulses like
4920,ENVOY,"day and night.--JOHN DAVIDSON, in _The Speaker_."
4921,ENVOY,
4922,ENVOY,
4923,ENVOY,When at the end of 1893 there appeared a little quarto volume of poems
4924,ENVOY,"by FRANCIS THOMPSON, the English world of letters experienced an"
4925,ENVOY,agreeable shock of surprise. It was as if a rocket had been sent up
4926,ENVOY,"into a dark night. His poems have all the ""pomp and prodigality"" of"
4927,ENVOY,imagination for which Gray's frugal muse longed.--_The Spectator._
4928,ENVOY,
4929,ENVOY,
4930,ENVOY,"Words and cadences must have had an intoxication for him, the"
4931,ENVOY,"intoxication of the scholar; and ""cloudy trophies"" were continually"
4932,ENVOY,"falling into his hands, and half through them, in his hurry to seize"
4933,ENVOY,"and brandish them. He swung a rare incense in a censer of gold, under"
4934,ENVOY,the vault of a chapel where he had hung votive offerings. When he
4935,ENVOY,"chanted in his chapel of dreams, the airs were often airs which he had"
4936,ENVOY,learnt from CRASHAW and from PATMORE. They came to life again when he
4937,ENVOY,"used them, and he made for himself a music which was part strangely"
4938,ENVOY,"familiar and part his own, almost bewilderingly. Such reed-notes and"
4939,ENVOY,such orchestration of sound were heard nowhere else; and people
4940,ENVOY,"listened to the music, entranced as by a new magic. The genius of"
4941,ENVOY,"FRANCIS THOMPSON was Oriental, exuberant in colour, woven into"
4942,ENVOY,"elaborate patterns, and went draped in old silk robes, that had"
4943,ENVOY,survived many dynasties. The spectacle of him was an enchantment; he
4944,ENVOY,"passed like a wild vagabond of the mind, dazzling our sight. He had no"
4945,ENVOY,"message, but he dropt sentences by the way, cries of joy or pity, love"
4946,ENVOY,"of children, worship of the Virgin and the Saints, and of those who"
4947,ENVOY,were patron saints to him on earth; his voice was heard like a
4948,ENVOY,"wandering music, which no one heeded for what it said, in a strange"
4949,ENVOY,"tongue, but which came troublingly into the mind, bringing it the"
4950,ENVOY,"solace of its old, recaptured melodies.--ARTHUR SYMONS, in _The"
4951,ENVOY,Saturday Review_.
4952,ENVOY,
4953,ENVOY,
4954,ENVOY,"To read Mr FRANCIS THOMPSON'S _Poems_, then, is like setting sail with"
4955,ENVOY,DRAKE or HAWKINS in search of new worlds and golden spoils. He has the
4956,ENVOY,"magnificent Elizabethan manner, the splendour of conception, the"
4957,ENVOY,"largeness of imagery.--KATHERINE TYNAN-HINKSON, in _The Bookman_."
4958,ENVOY,
4959,ENVOY,
4960,ENVOY,As a matter of fact--such fact as one kisses the book to in a court of
4961,ENVOY,law--it was in a railway carriage on my way back to London that I first
4962,ENVOY,"read Mr THOMPSON'S poem, _The Mistress of Vision_; but, in such truth"
4963,ENVOY,"as would pass anywhere but in a court of law, it was at Cambridge, in"
4964,ENVOY,the height of the summer term and in a Fellows' Garden that the
4965,ENVOY,revelation first came. I thought then in my enthusiasm that no such
4966,ENVOY,"poem had been written or attempted since COLERIDGE attempted, and left"
4967,ENVOY,"off writing, _Kubla Khan_. In a cooler hour I think so yet; and, were"
4968,ENVOY,"my age twenty-five or so, it would delight me to swear to it, riding to"
4969,ENVOY,"any man's drawbridge who shuts his gates against it, and blowing the"
4970,ENVOY,"horn of challenge. It is verily a wonderful poem; hung, like a fairy"
4971,ENVOY,"tale, in middle air--a sleeping palace of beauty set in a glade in the"
4972,ENVOY,"heart of the woods of Westermain, surprised there and recognized with a"
4973,ENVOY,"gasp as satisfying, and summarizing a thousand youthful longings after"
4974,ENVOY,beauty. To me also my admiration seemed too hot to last; but four or
4975,ENVOY,five years leave me unrepentant. It seemed to me to be more likely to
4976,ENVOY,"be a perishable joy, because I had once clutched at, and seemed to"
4977,ENVOY,"grasp, similar beauties in POE. Mr THOMPSON'S thought, always strong,"
4978,ENVOY,often runs into phrases of exquisite sweetness and exquisite
4979,ENVOY,clarity.... The lines beginning:
4980,ENVOY,
4981,ENVOY,"""Firm is the man, and set beyond the cast"
4982,ENVOY,"Of fortune's game and the iniquitous hour,"""
4983,ENVOY,
4984,ENVOY,are worthy to be remembered beside DANIEL'S _Epistle to the Countess of
4985,ENVOY,"Cumberland_.--Sir A. QUILLER COUCH (""Q""), in _The Daily News_."
4986,ENVOY,
4987,ENVOY,
4988,ENVOY,"Thompson's poetry is a ""wassail of orgiac imageries."" He is a poet's"
4989,ENVOY,"poet, like SHELLEY and BLAKE. In order to follow him as he soars from"
4990,ENVOY,"image to image and symbol to symbol, you must have the rare wings of"
4991,ENVOY,imagination.... THOMPSON mixes his metaphors so wisely that they
4992,ENVOY,"illumine each other, strange light shooting out of their weltering"
4993,ENVOY,"chaos, like the radiance of phosphorescent waves. He troubles you with"
4994,ENVOY,sudden pictures that flash out against the blackness. This gift of
4995,ENVOY,"dreadful vision is not found in CRASHAW or in PATMORE, in DONNE or in"
4996,ENVOY,"HERBERT, and therefore it seems to me that THOMPSON is essentially more"
4997,ENVOY,"akin to BLAKE, COLERIDGE and ROSSETTI than to the ecclesiastical"
4998,ENVOY,mystics. He is a twentieth-century mystic with a seventeenth-century
4999,ENVOY,"manner.--JAMES DOUGLAS, in _The Morning Leader_."
5000,ENVOY,
5001,ENVOY,
5002,ENVOY,"Great poets are obscure for two opposite reasons; now, because they are"
5003,ENVOY,"talking about something too large for anyone to understand, and now,"
5004,ENVOY,"again, because they are talking about something too small for anyone to"
5005,ENVOY,see. FRANCIS THOMPSON possessed both these infinities.... He was
5006,ENVOY,"describing the evening earth with its mist and fume and fragrance, and"
5007,ENVOY,represented the whole as rolling upwards like a smoke; then suddenly
5008,ENVOY,"he called the whole ball of the earth a thurible, and said that some"
5009,ENVOY,gigantic spirit swung it slowly before God. This is the case of the
5010,ENVOY,image too large for comprehension; another instance sticks in my mind
5011,ENVOY,of the image which is too small. In one of his poems he says that the
5012,ENVOY,"abyss between the known and the unknown is bridged by ""Pontifical"
5013,ENVOY,"death."" There are about ten historical and theological puns in that one"
5014,ENVOY,"word. That a priest means a pontiff, that a pontiff means a"
5015,ENVOY,"bridge-maker, that death is certainly a bridge, that death may turn out"
5016,ENVOY,"after all to be a reconciling priest, that at least priest and bridges"
5017,ENVOY,both attest to the fact that one thing can get separated from another
5018,ENVOY,"thing--these ideas, and twenty more, are all tacitly concentrated in"
5019,ENVOY,"the word ""Pontifical."" In FRANCIS THOMPSON'S poetry, as in the poetry"
5020,ENVOY,"of the universe, you can work infinitely out and out, but yet"
5021,ENVOY,infinitely in and in. These two infinities are the mark of greatness;
5022,ENVOY,"and he was a great poet.--G. K. CHESTERTON, in _The Illustrated London"
5023,ENVOY,News_.
5024,ENVOY,
5025,ENVOY,
5026,ENVOY,Thompson used his large vocabulary with a boldness--and especially a
5027,ENVOY,"recklessness, almost a frivolity in rhyme--that were worthy of"
5028,ENVOY,"BROWNING. On the other hand, these rugged points were, at a further"
5029,ENVOY,"view, absorbed into the total effect of beauty in a manner which"
5030,ENVOY,"BROWNING never achieved; for the poet, entirely free from timidity in"
5031,ENVOY,"matters of poetic form, relied not on chastity or perfection of detail,"
5032,ENVOY,"but on the perfervid rush of his genius, which simply carried his"
5033,ENVOY,readers over the rough places. Here was a large utterance--large in
5034,ENVOY,"bulk, in speed, in a lavish disregard of economy, and yet, what could"
5035,ENVOY,not for a moment be mistaken was that the poetry was at once great and
5036,ENVOY,"sincere. These _Sister Songs_, written in praise of two little sisters,"
5037,ENVOY,"contain a number of lovely and most musical lines, and some"
5038,ENVOY,passages--such as the seventh section of the first poem--which SPENSER
5039,ENVOY,would not have disowned.--_The Times._
5040,ENVOY,
5041,ENVOY,
5042,ENVOY,"The greater a poet's message, the more profound his thought, the larger"
5043,ENVOY,"his range, and the more exquisite his note, the deeper and more"
5044,ENVOY,incessant will be his demand upon his reader. That is why the great
5045,ENVOY,poets have had to wait for their recognition. Only the few will or can
5046,ENVOY,"co-operate at the beginning, but they are the leaven; and now whole"
5047,ENVOY,"masses can see the poetic purport of SHELLEY, COLERIDGE, KEATS and"
5048,ENVOY,"WORDSWORTH, of whom the contemporary criticism was a thing over which"
5049,ENVOY,"you laugh or cry, as the mood has you. Those who see in Mr FRANCIS"
5050,ENVOY,THOMPSON an authentic poet have at any rate the profound interest of
5051,ENVOY,watching the various stages in the making of their immortal. How have
5052,ENVOY,the portents followed the precedent afforded by the poets just named?
5053,ENVOY,"In general, very accurately, we think. The common attitude of critics"
5054,ENVOY,towards them and him has been very similar--in the case of SHELLEY it
5055,ENVOY,is so near in its very wording as to be sometimes startling.
5056,ENVOY,"Extravagances and novelties of diction, a toppling over of images, and"
5057,ENVOY,"""obscurity""--of course that--were dwelt upon by objectors--very just"
5058,ENVOY,"objectors, no doubt--who busied and troubled about details, lost all"
5059,ENVOY,"sense of proportion, and had no ear for the great and ultimate meaning"
5060,ENVOY,of the poet's message.... The note that comes most majestically from Mr
5061,ENVOY,THOMPSON is that of the reconciliation of the two natures and destinies
5062,ENVOY,of man. To that literal oneness WORDSWORTH groped in his merely
5063,ENVOY,"""kindred points of heaven and home."" Of that oneness ROSSETTI has the"
5064,ENVOY,"hint, and COVENTRY PATMORE the full vision. Mr THOMPSON is the heir of"
5065,ENVOY,"the poets, and he has entered fully into his inheritance. He has not"
5066,ENVOY,picked their flowers and worn them fading; their seed has passed into
5067,ENVOY,"his life, and they have blossomed anew.--_The Academy._"
5068,ENVOY,
5069,ENVOY,
5070,ENVOY,No other among the younger poets so effectually proclaimed a mastery of
5071,ENVOY,the grand style: none other had so securely occupied a position on the
5072,ENVOY,right side of the line which for ever separates inspiration from
5073,ENVOY,"talent, poetry from agreeable verse. He appeared on the scene fully"
5074,ENVOY,"equipped. There were no long years of public neglect, or production of"
5075,ENVOY,volumes which lay unnoticed on the bookstalls before being cast into
5076,ENVOY,the dust heap. The marvellous splendour of his first volume revealed a
5077,ENVOY,"writer of no common order; with a secureness of touch, a magical"
5078,ENVOY,"decoration of style, and a real message behind all the pomp and glitter"
5079,ENVOY,"and dazzling display. It was art not for art's sake, but charged with a"
5080,ENVOY,meaning and a name. _The Hound of Heaven_ was hailed by all competent
5081,ENVOY,critics as one of the great religious poems of this time or of any
5082,ENVOY,time.--_The Daily News._
