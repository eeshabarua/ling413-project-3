111,ELEGY,
112,ELEGY,
113,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream!
114,ELEGY,Known and loved so long
115,ELEGY,"That hast heard the song,"
116,ELEGY,And the idle dream
117,ELEGY,Of my boyish day;
118,ELEGY,While I once again
119,ELEGY,"Down thy margin stray,"
120,ELEGY,In the selfsame strain
121,ELEGY,"Still my voice is spent,"
122,ELEGY,With my old lament
123,ELEGY,"And my idle dream,"
124,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream!
125,ELEGY,
126,ELEGY,Where my old seat was
127,ELEGY,"Here again I sit,"
128,ELEGY,Where the long boughs knit
129,ELEGY,Over stream and grass
130,ELEGY,A translucent eaves:
131,ELEGY,Where back eddies play
132,ELEGY,"Shipwreck with the leaves,"
133,ELEGY,"And the proud swans stray,"
134,ELEGY,Sailing one by one
135,ELEGY,"Out of stream and sun,"
136,ELEGY,And the fish lie cool
137,ELEGY,In their chosen pool.
138,ELEGY,
139,ELEGY,Many an afternoon
140,ELEGY,Of the summer day
141,ELEGY,Dreaming here I lay;
142,ELEGY,"And I know how soon,"
143,ELEGY,"Idly at its hour,"
144,ELEGY,First the deep bell hums
145,ELEGY,"From the minster tower,"
146,ELEGY,"And then evening comes,"
147,ELEGY,"Creeping up the glade,"
148,ELEGY,"With her lengthening shade,"
149,ELEGY,"And the tardy boon,"
150,ELEGY,Of her brightening moon.
151,ELEGY,
152,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream!
153,ELEGY,Ere again I go
154,ELEGY,"Where thou dost not flow,"
155,ELEGY,Well does it beseem
156,ELEGY,Thee to hear again
157,ELEGY,"Once my youthful song,"
158,ELEGY,That familiar strain
159,ELEGY,Silent now so long:
160,ELEGY,Be as I content
161,ELEGY,With my old lament
162,ELEGY,"And my idle dream,"
163,ELEGY,Clear and gentle stream.

169,ELEGY,
170,ELEGY,ELEGY
171,ELEGY,
172,ELEGY,
173,ELEGY,The wood is bare: a river-mist is steeping
174,ELEGY,The trees that winter’s chill of life bereaves:
175,ELEGY,"Only their stiffened boughs break silence, weeping"
176,ELEGY,Over their fallen leaves;
177,ELEGY,
178,ELEGY,"That lie upon the dank earth brown and rotten,"
179,ELEGY,Miry and matted in the soaking wet:
180,ELEGY,"Forgotten with the spring, that is forgotten"
181,ELEGY,By them that can forget.
182,ELEGY,
183,ELEGY,"Yet it was here we walked when ferns were springing,"
184,ELEGY,And through the mossy bank shot bud and blade:—
185,ELEGY,"Here found in summer, when the birds were singing,"
186,ELEGY,A green and pleasant shade.
187,ELEGY,
188,ELEGY,’Twas here we loved in sunnier days and greener;
189,ELEGY,"And now, in this disconsolate decay,"
190,ELEGY,"I come to see her where I most have seen her,"
191,ELEGY,And touch the happier day.
192,ELEGY,
193,ELEGY,"For on this path, at every turn and corner,"
194,ELEGY,The fancy of her figure on me falls:
195,ELEGY,"Yet walks she with the slow step of a mourner,"
196,ELEGY,Nor hears my voice that calls.
197,ELEGY,
198,ELEGY,"So through my heart there winds a track of feeling,"
199,ELEGY,"A path of memory, that is all her own:"
200,ELEGY,Whereto her phantom beauty ever stealing
201,ELEGY,Haunts the sad spot alone.
202,ELEGY,
203,ELEGY,"About her steps the trunks are bare, the branches"
204,ELEGY,Drip heavy tears upon her downcast head;
205,ELEGY,"And bleed unseen wounds that no sun staunches,"
206,ELEGY,For the year’s sun is dead.
207,ELEGY,
208,ELEGY,And dead leaves wrap the fruits that summer planted:
209,ELEGY,And birds that love the South have taken wing.
210,ELEGY,"The wanderer, loitering o’er the scene enchanted,"
211,ELEGY,"Weeps, and despairs of spring."

217,ELEGY,
218,ELEGY,
219,ELEGY,"Poor withered rose and dry,"
220,ELEGY,"Skeleton of a rose,"
221,ELEGY,Risen to testify
222,ELEGY,To love’s sad close:
223,ELEGY,
224,ELEGY,"Treasured for love’s sweet sake,"
225,ELEGY,That of joy past
226,ELEGY,Thou might’st again awake
227,ELEGY,Memory at last.
228,ELEGY,
229,ELEGY,Yet is thy perfume sweet;
230,ELEGY,Thy petals red
231,ELEGY,"Yet tell of summer heat,"
232,ELEGY,And the gay bed:
233,ELEGY,
234,ELEGY,"Yet, yet recall the glow"
235,ELEGY,"Of the gazing sun,"
236,ELEGY,When at thy bush we two
237,ELEGY,Joined hands in one.
238,ELEGY,
239,ELEGY,"But, rose, thou hast not seen,"
240,ELEGY,Thou hast not wept
241,ELEGY,"The change that passed between,"
242,ELEGY,Whilst thou hast slept.
243,ELEGY,
244,ELEGY,To me thou seemest yet
245,ELEGY,The dead dream’s thrall:
246,ELEGY,While I live and forget
247,ELEGY,"Dream, truth and all."
248,ELEGY,
249,ELEGY,"Thou art more fresh than I,"
250,ELEGY,"Rose, sweet and red:"
251,ELEGY,Salt on my pale cheeks lie
252,ELEGY,The tears I shed.

273,THE OCEAN.,THE OCEAN.
274,THE OCEAN.,
275,THE OCEAN.,Were I a cloud I’d gather
276,THE OCEAN.,"My skirts up in the air,"
277,THE OCEAN.,"And fly I well know whither,"
278,THE OCEAN.,And rest I well know where.
279,THE OCEAN.,
280,THE OCEAN.,"As pointed the star surely,"
281,THE OCEAN.,"The legend tells of old,"
282,THE OCEAN.,Where the wise kings might offer
283,THE OCEAN.,"Myrrh, frankincense, and gold;"
284,THE OCEAN.,
285,THE OCEAN.,Above the house I’d hover
286,THE OCEAN.,"Where dwells my love, and wait"
287,THE OCEAN.,Till haply I might spy her
288,THE OCEAN.,Throw back the garden-gate.
289,THE OCEAN.,
290,THE OCEAN.,There in the summer evening
291,THE OCEAN.,I would bedeck the moon;
292,THE OCEAN.,I would float down and screen her
293,THE OCEAN.,From the sun’s rays at noon;
294,THE OCEAN.,
295,THE OCEAN.,"And if her flowers should languish,"
296,THE OCEAN.,"Or wither in the drought,"
297,THE OCEAN.,Upon her tall white lilies
298,THE OCEAN.,I’d pour my heart’s blood out:
299,THE OCEAN.,
300,THE OCEAN.,"So if she wore one only,"
301,THE OCEAN.,"And shook not out the rain,"
302,THE OCEAN.,"Were I a cloud, O cloudlet,"
303,THE OCEAN.,I had not lived in vain.

308,A CLOUD.,A CLOUD.
309,A CLOUD.,
310,A CLOUD.,"But were I thou, O ocean,"
311,A CLOUD.,I would not chafe and fret
312,A CLOUD.,"As thou, because a limit"
313,A CLOUD.,To thy desires is set.
314,A CLOUD.,
315,A CLOUD.,"I would be blue, and gentle,"
316,A CLOUD.,"Patient, and calm, and see"
317,A CLOUD.,"If my smiles might not tempt her,"
318,A CLOUD.,"My love, to come to me."
319,A CLOUD.,
320,A CLOUD.,"I’d make my depths transparent,"
321,A CLOUD.,"And still, that she should lean"
322,A CLOUD.,O’er the boat’s edge to ponder
323,A CLOUD.,The sights that swam between.
324,A CLOUD.,
325,A CLOUD.,"I would command strange creatures,"
326,A CLOUD.,"Of bright hue and quick fin,"
327,A CLOUD.,"To stir the water near her,"
328,A CLOUD.,And tempt her bare arm in.
329,A CLOUD.,
330,A CLOUD.,I’d teach her spend the summer
331,A CLOUD.,"With me: and I can tell,"
332,A CLOUD.,"That, were I thou, O ocean,"
333,A CLOUD.,My love should love me well.
334,A CLOUD.,

336,A CLOUD.,*       *       *       *       *
337,A CLOUD.,
338,A CLOUD.,"But on the mad cloud scudded,"
339,A CLOUD.,The breeze it blew so stiff;
340,A CLOUD.,"And the sad ocean bellowed,"
341,A CLOUD.,And pounded at the cliff.

347,A CLOUD.,
348,A CLOUD.,
349,A CLOUD.,I heard a linnet courting
350,A CLOUD.,His lady in the spring:
351,A CLOUD.,"His mates were idly sporting,"
352,A CLOUD.,Nor stayed to hear him sing
353,A CLOUD.,His song of love.—
354,A CLOUD.,I fear my speech distorting
355,A CLOUD.,His tender love.
356,A CLOUD.,
357,A CLOUD.,The phrases of his pleading
358,A CLOUD.,Were full of young delight;
359,A CLOUD.,And she that gave him heeding
360,A CLOUD.,Interpreted aright
361,A CLOUD.,"His gay, sweet notes,—"
362,A CLOUD.,"So sadly marred in the reading,—"
363,A CLOUD.,His tender notes.
364,A CLOUD.,
365,A CLOUD.,"And when he ceased, the hearer"
366,A CLOUD.,"Awaited the refrain,"
367,A CLOUD.,Till swiftly perching nearer
368,A CLOUD.,"He sang his song again,"
369,A CLOUD.,His pretty song:—
370,A CLOUD.,Would that my verse spake clearer
371,A CLOUD.,His tender song!
372,A CLOUD.,
373,A CLOUD.,"Ye happy, airy creatures!"
374,A CLOUD.,That in the merry spring
375,A CLOUD.,Think not of what misfeatures
376,A CLOUD.,Or cares the year may bring;
377,A CLOUD.,But unto love
378,A CLOUD.,"Resign your simple natures,"
379,A CLOUD.,To tender love.

387,A CLOUD.,"Dear lady, when thou frownest,"
388,A CLOUD.,"And my true love despisest,"
389,A CLOUD.,And all thy vows disownest
390,A CLOUD.,That sealed my venture wisest;
391,A CLOUD.,I think thy pride’s displeasure
392,A CLOUD.,Neglects a matchless treasure
393,A CLOUD.,Exceeding price and measure.
394,A CLOUD.,
395,A CLOUD.,"But when again thou smilest,"
396,A CLOUD.,"And love for love returnest,"
397,A CLOUD.,"And fear with joy beguilest,"
398,A CLOUD.,And takest truth in earnest;
399,A CLOUD.,"Then, though I sheer adore thee,"
400,A CLOUD.,The sum of my love for thee
401,A CLOUD.,"Seems poor, scant, and unworthy."

404,A CLOUD.,
405,A CLOUD.,
406,A CLOUD.,7
407,A CLOUD.,
408,A CLOUD.,
409,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
410,A CLOUD.,Ends all our month-long love in this?
411,A CLOUD.,"Can it be summed up so,"
412,A CLOUD.,Quit in a single kiss?
413,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
414,A CLOUD.,
415,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
416,A CLOUD.,"If thy words’ breath could scare thy deeds,"
417,A CLOUD.,As the soft south can blow
418,A CLOUD.,"And toss the feathered seeds,"
419,A CLOUD.,Then might I let thee go.
420,A CLOUD.,
421,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
422,A CLOUD.,"Had not the great sun seen, I might;"
423,A CLOUD.,Or were he reckoned slow
424,A CLOUD.,"To bring the false to light,"
425,A CLOUD.,Then might I let thee go.
426,A CLOUD.,
427,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
428,A CLOUD.,The stars that crowd the summer skies
429,A CLOUD.,Have watched us so below
430,A CLOUD.,"With all their million eyes,"
431,A CLOUD.,I dare not let thee go.
432,A CLOUD.,
433,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
434,A CLOUD.,"Have we not chid the changeful moon,"
435,A CLOUD.,"Now rising late, and now"
436,A CLOUD.,"Because she set too soon,"
437,A CLOUD.,And shall I let thee go?
438,A CLOUD.,
439,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
440,A CLOUD.,"Have not the young flowers been content,"
441,A CLOUD.,"Plucked ere their buds could blow,"
442,A CLOUD.,To seal our sacrament?
443,A CLOUD.,I cannot let thee go.
444,A CLOUD.,
445,A CLOUD.,I will not let thee go.
446,A CLOUD.,I hold thee by too many bands:
447,A CLOUD.,"Thou sayest farewell, and lo!"
448,A CLOUD.,"I have thee by the hands,"
449,A CLOUD.,And will not let thee go.

455,A CLOUD.,
456,A CLOUD.,
457,A CLOUD.,I found to-day out walking
458,A CLOUD.,The flower my love loves best.
459,A CLOUD.,"What, when I stooped to pluck it,"
460,A CLOUD.,Could dare my hand arrest?
461,A CLOUD.,
462,A CLOUD.,Was it a snake lay curling
463,A CLOUD.,About the root’s thick crown?
464,A CLOUD.,Or did some hidden bramble
465,A CLOUD.,Tear my hand reaching down?
466,A CLOUD.,
467,A CLOUD.,"There was no snake uncurling,"
468,A CLOUD.,And no thorn wounded me;
469,A CLOUD.,"’Twas my heart checked me, sighing"
470,A CLOUD.,She is beyond the sea.
471,A CLOUD.,

475,A CLOUD.,9
476,A CLOUD.,
477,A CLOUD.,
478,A CLOUD.,"A poppy grows upon the shore,"
479,A CLOUD.,Bursts her twin cup in summer late:
480,A CLOUD.,"Her leaves are glaucous-green and hoar,"
481,A CLOUD.,"Her petals yellow, delicate."
482,A CLOUD.,
483,A CLOUD.,"Oft to her cousins turns her thought,"
484,A CLOUD.,In wonder if they care that she
485,A CLOUD.,"Is fed with spray for dew, and caught"
486,A CLOUD.,By every gale that sweeps the sea.
487,A CLOUD.,
488,A CLOUD.,"She has no lovers like the red,"
489,A CLOUD.,That dances with the noble corn:
490,A CLOUD.,"Her blossoms on the waves are shed,"
491,A CLOUD.,Where she stands shivering and forlorn.
492,A CLOUD.,

494,A CLOUD.,
495,A CLOUD.,
496,A CLOUD.,10
497,A CLOUD.,
498,A CLOUD.,
499,A CLOUD.,Sometimes when my lady sits by me
500,A CLOUD.,"My rapture’s so great, that I tear"
501,A CLOUD.,"My mind from the thought that she’s nigh me,"
502,A CLOUD.,And strive to forget that she’s there.
503,A CLOUD.,And sometimes when she is away
504,A CLOUD.,"Her absence so sorely does try me,"
505,A CLOUD.,"That I shut to my eyes, and assay"
506,A CLOUD.,To think she is there sitting by me.
507,A CLOUD.,

509,A CLOUD.,
510,A CLOUD.,
511,A CLOUD.,11
512,A CLOUD.,
513,A CLOUD.,
514,A CLOUD.,"Long are the hours the sun is above,"
515,A CLOUD.,But when evening comes I go home to my love.
516,A CLOUD.,
517,A CLOUD.,"I’m away the daylight hours and more,"
518,A CLOUD.,Yet she comes not down to open the door.
519,A CLOUD.,
520,A CLOUD.,"She does not meet me upon the stair,—"
521,A CLOUD.,She sits in my chamber and waits for me there.
522,A CLOUD.,
523,A CLOUD.,As I enter the room she does not move:
524,A CLOUD.,I always walk straight up to my love;
525,A CLOUD.,
526,A CLOUD.,And she lets me take my wonted place
527,A CLOUD.,"At her side, and gaze in her dear dear face."
528,A CLOUD.,
529,A CLOUD.,"There as I sit, from her head thrown back"
530,A CLOUD.,Her hair falls straight in a shadow black.
531,A CLOUD.,
532,A CLOUD.,"Aching and hot as my tired eyes be,"
533,A CLOUD.,She is all that I wish to see.
534,A CLOUD.,
535,A CLOUD.,"And in my wearied and toil-dinned ear,"
536,A CLOUD.,She says all things that I wish to hear.
537,A CLOUD.,
538,A CLOUD.,"Dusky and duskier grows the room,"
539,A CLOUD.,Yet I see her best in the darker gloom.

1027,WOOING,"Cried Wisdom, and consider:"
1028,WOOING,"Go free, since go thou must;—"
1029,WOOING,And so farewell I bid her.
1030,WOOING,
1031,WOOING,And brisk upon my way
1032,WOOING,"I smote the stroke to sever,"
1033,WOOING,And should have lost that day
1034,WOOING,My life’s delight for ever:
1035,WOOING,
1036,WOOING,But when I saw her start
1037,WOOING,And turn aside and tremble;—
1038,WOOING,"Ah! she was true, her heart"
1039,WOOING,I knew did not dissemble.

1047,WOOING,"There is a hill beside the silver Thames,"
1048,WOOING,Shady with birch and beech and odorous pine:
1049,WOOING,And brilliant underfoot with thousand gems
1050,WOOING,Steeply the thickets to his floods decline.
1051,WOOING,Straight trees in every place
1052,WOOING,"Their thick tops interlace,"
1053,WOOING,And pendant branches trail their foliage fine
1054,WOOING,Upon his watery face.
1055,WOOING,
1056,WOOING,Swift from the sweltering pasturage he flows:
1057,WOOING,"His stream, alert to seek the pleasant shade,"
1058,WOOING,"Pictures his gentle purpose, as he goes"
1059,WOOING,Straight to the caverned pool his toil has made.
1060,WOOING,His winter floods lay bare
1061,WOOING,The stout roots in the air:
1062,WOOING,"His summer streams are cool, when they have played"
1063,WOOING,Among their fibrous hair.
1064,WOOING,
1065,WOOING,"A rushy island guards the sacred bower,"
1066,WOOING,"And hides it from the meadow, where in peace"
1067,WOOING,"The lazy cows wrench many a scented flower,"
1068,WOOING,Robbing the golden market of the bees:
1069,WOOING,And laden barges float
1070,WOOING,By banks of myosote;
1071,WOOING,And scented flag and golden flower-de-lys
1072,WOOING,Delay the loitering boat.
1073,WOOING,
1074,WOOING,"And on this side the island, where the pool"
1075,WOOING,"Eddies away, are tangled mass on mass"
1076,WOOING,"The water-weeds, that net the fishes cool,"
1077,WOOING,And scarce allow a narrow stream to pass;
1078,WOOING,Where spreading crowfoot mars
1079,WOOING,"The drowning nenuphars,"
1080,WOOING,Waving the tassels of her silken grass
1081,WOOING,Below her silver stars.
1082,WOOING,
1083,WOOING,"But in the purple pool there nothing grows,"
1084,WOOING,Not the white water-lily spoked with gold;
1085,WOOING,"Though best she loves the hollows, and well knows"
1086,WOOING,On quiet streams her broad shields to unfold:
1087,WOOING,Yet should her roots but try
1088,WOOING,"Within these deeps to lie,"
1089,WOOING,Not her long reaching stalk could ever hold
1090,WOOING,Her waxen head so high.
1091,WOOING,
1092,WOOING,"Sometimes an angler comes, and drops his hook"
1093,WOOING,"Within its hidden depths, and ’gainst a tree"
1094,WOOING,"Leaning his rod, reads in some pleasant book,"
1095,WOOING,Forgetting soon his pride of fishery;
1096,WOOING,"And dreams, or falls asleep,"
1097,WOOING,While curious fishes peep
1098,WOOING,"About his nibbled bait, or scornfully"
1099,WOOING,Dart off and rise and leap.
1100,WOOING,
1101,WOOING,"And sometimes a slow figure ’neath the trees,"
1102,WOOING,"In ancient-fashioned smock, with tottering care"
1103,WOOING,"Upon a staff propping his weary knees,"
1104,WOOING,May by the pathway of the forest fare:
1105,WOOING,As from a buried day
1106,WOOING,Across the mind will stray
1107,WOOING,"Some perishing mute shadow,—and unaware"
1108,WOOING,He passeth on his way.
1109,WOOING,
1110,WOOING,"Else, he that wishes solitude is safe,"
1111,WOOING,Whether he bathe at morning in the stream:
1112,WOOING,Or lead his love there when the hot hours chafe
1113,WOOING,"The meadows, busy with a blurring steam;"
1114,WOOING,"Or watch, as fades the light,"
1115,WOOING,"The gibbous moon grow bright,"

1122,WOOING,No sharer of my secret I allow:

1906,INDOLENCE,
1907,INDOLENCE,We left the city when the summer day
1908,INDOLENCE,"Had verged already on its hot decline,"
1909,INDOLENCE,And charmed Indolence in languor lay
1910,INDOLENCE,"In her gay gardens, ’neath her towers divine:"
1911,INDOLENCE,"’Farewell,’ we said, ’dear city of youth and dream!’"
1912,INDOLENCE,And in our boat we stepped and took the stream.
1913,INDOLENCE,
1914,INDOLENCE,All through that idle afternoon we strayed
1915,INDOLENCE,"Upon our proposed travel well begun,"
1916,INDOLENCE,"As loitering by the woodland’s dreamy shade,"
1917,INDOLENCE,"Past shallow islets floating in the sun,"
1918,INDOLENCE,Or searching down the banks for rarer flowers
1919,INDOLENCE,We lingered out the pleasurable hours.
1920,INDOLENCE,
1921,INDOLENCE,"Till when that loveliest came, which mowers home"
1922,INDOLENCE,"Turns from their longest labour, as we steered"
1923,INDOLENCE,"Along a straitened channel flecked with foam,"
1924,INDOLENCE,"We lost our landscape wide, and slowly neared"
1925,INDOLENCE,"An ancient bridge, that like a blind wall lay"
1926,INDOLENCE,Low on its buried vaults to block the way.
1927,INDOLENCE,
1928,INDOLENCE,"Then soon the narrow tunnels broader showed,"
1929,INDOLENCE,Where with its arches three it sucked the mass
1930,INDOLENCE,"Of water, that in swirl thereunder flowed,"
1931,INDOLENCE,Or stood piled at the piers waiting to pass;
1932,INDOLENCE,"And pulling for the middle span, we drew"
1933,INDOLENCE,The tender blades aboard and floated through.
1934,INDOLENCE,
1935,INDOLENCE,But past the bridge what change we found below!
1936,INDOLENCE,"The stream, that all day long had laughed and played"
1937,INDOLENCE,"Betwixt the happy shires, ran dark and slow,"
1938,INDOLENCE,And with its easy flood no murmur made:
1939,INDOLENCE,"And weeds spread on its surface, and about"
1940,INDOLENCE,The stagnant margin reared their stout heads out.
1941,INDOLENCE,
1942,INDOLENCE,"Upon the left high elms, with giant wood"
1943,INDOLENCE,"Skirting the water-meadows, interwove"
1944,INDOLENCE,"Their slumbrous crowns, o’ershadowing where they stood"
1945,INDOLENCE,The floor and heavy pillars of the grove:
1946,INDOLENCE,"And in the shade, through reeds and sedges dank,"
1947,INDOLENCE,A footpath led along the moated bank.
1948,INDOLENCE,
1949,INDOLENCE,"Across, all down the right, an old brick wall,"
1950,INDOLENCE,"Above and o’er the channel, red did lean;"
1951,INDOLENCE,"Here buttressed up, and bulging there to fall,"
1952,INDOLENCE,Tufted with grass and plants and lichen green;
1953,INDOLENCE,"And crumbling to the flood, which at its base"
1954,INDOLENCE,Slid gently nor disturbed its mirrored face.
1955,INDOLENCE,
1956,INDOLENCE,"Sheer on the wall the houses rose, their backs"
1957,INDOLENCE,"All windowless, neglected and awry,"
1958,INDOLENCE,"With tottering coins, and crooked chimney stacks;"
1959,INDOLENCE,"And here and there an unused door, set high"
1960,INDOLENCE,"Above the fragments of its mouldering stair,"
1961,INDOLENCE,With rail and broken step led out on air.
1962,INDOLENCE,
1963,INDOLENCE,"Beyond, deserted wharfs and vacant sheds,"
1964,INDOLENCE,"With empty boats and barges moored along,"
1965,INDOLENCE,"And rafts half-sunken, fringed with weedy shreds,"
1966,INDOLENCE,"And sodden beams, once soaked to season strong."
1967,INDOLENCE,"No sight of man, nor sight of life, no stroke,"
1968,INDOLENCE,No voice the somnolence and silence broke.
1969,INDOLENCE,
1970,INDOLENCE,"Then I who rowed leant on my oar, whose drip"
1971,INDOLENCE,"Fell without sparkle, and I rowed no more;"
1972,INDOLENCE,"And he that steered moved neither hand nor lip,"
1973,INDOLENCE,But turned his wondering eye from shore to shore;
1974,INDOLENCE,"And our trim boat let her swift motion die,"
1975,INDOLENCE,Between the dim reflections floating by.

1982,INDOLENCE,
1983,INDOLENCE,"I praise the tender flower,"
1984,INDOLENCE,That on a mournful day
1985,INDOLENCE,Bloomed in my garden bower
1986,INDOLENCE,And made the winter gay.
1987,INDOLENCE,Its loveliness contented
1988,INDOLENCE,My heart tormented.
1989,INDOLENCE,
1990,INDOLENCE,I praise the gentle maid
1991,INDOLENCE,Whose happy voice and smile
1992,INDOLENCE,To confidence betrayed
1993,INDOLENCE,My doleful heart awhile:
1994,INDOLENCE,And gave my spirit deploring
1995,INDOLENCE,Fresh wings for soaring.
1996,INDOLENCE,
1997,INDOLENCE,The maid for very fear
1998,INDOLENCE,Of love I durst not tell:
1999,INDOLENCE,"The rose could never hear,"
2000,INDOLENCE,Though I bespake her well:
2001,INDOLENCE,So in my song I bind them
2002,INDOLENCE,For all to find them.

2009,INDOLENCE,
2010,INDOLENCE,A winter’s night with the snow about:
2011,INDOLENCE,’Twas silent within and cold without:
2012,INDOLENCE,Both father and mother to bed were gone:
2013,INDOLENCE,The son sat yet by the fire alone.
2014,INDOLENCE,
2015,INDOLENCE,"He gazed on the fire, and dreamed again"
2016,INDOLENCE,Of one that was now no more among men:
2017,INDOLENCE,As still he sat and never aware
2018,INDOLENCE,How close was the spirit beside his chair.
2019,INDOLENCE,
2020,INDOLENCE,"Nay, sad were his thoughts, for he wept and said"
2021,INDOLENCE,"Ah, woe for the dead! ah, woe for the dead!"
2022,INDOLENCE,"How heavy the earth lies now on her breast,"
2023,INDOLENCE,"The lips that I kissed, and the hand I pressed."
2024,INDOLENCE,
2025,INDOLENCE,"The spirit he saw not, he could not hear"
2026,INDOLENCE,The comforting word she spake in his ear:
2027,INDOLENCE,His heart in the grave with her mouldering clay
2028,INDOLENCE,No welcome gave—and she fled away.

2036,INDOLENCE,"My bed and pillow are cold,"
2037,INDOLENCE,"My heart is faint with dread,"
2038,INDOLENCE,"The air hath an odour of mould,"
2039,INDOLENCE,I dream I lie with the dead:
2040,INDOLENCE,"I cannot move,"
2041,INDOLENCE,"O come to me, love,"
2042,INDOLENCE,Or else I am dead.
2043,INDOLENCE,
2044,INDOLENCE,The feet I hear on the floor
2045,INDOLENCE,Tread heavily overhead:
2046,INDOLENCE,"O Love, come down to the door,"
2047,INDOLENCE,"Come, Love, come, ere I be dead:"
2048,INDOLENCE,"Make shine thy light,"
2049,INDOLENCE,"O Love, in the night;"
2050,INDOLENCE,Or else I am dead.

2057,INDOLENCE,
2058,INDOLENCE,"O thou unfaithful, still as ever dearest,"
2059,INDOLENCE,"That in thy beauty to my eyes appearest,"
2060,INDOLENCE,In fancy rising now to re-awaken
2061,INDOLENCE,My love unshaken;
2062,INDOLENCE,
2063,INDOLENCE,"All thou’st forgotten, but no change can free thee,"
2064,INDOLENCE,"No hate unmake thee; as thou wert I see thee,"
2065,INDOLENCE,"And am contented, eye from fond eye meeting"
2066,INDOLENCE,Its ample greeting.
2067,INDOLENCE,
2068,INDOLENCE,"O thou my star of stars, among things wholly"
2069,INDOLENCE,"Devoted, sacred, dim and melancholy,"
2070,INDOLENCE,The only joy of all the joys I cherished
2071,INDOLENCE,"That hast not perished,"
2072,INDOLENCE,
2073,INDOLENCE,"Why now on others squand’rest thou the treasure,"
2074,INDOLENCE,That to be jealous of is still my pleasure:
2075,INDOLENCE,"As still I dream ’tis me whom thou invitest,"
2076,INDOLENCE,Me thou delightest?
2077,INDOLENCE,
2078,INDOLENCE,"But day by day my joy hath feebler being,"
2079,INDOLENCE,"The fading picture tires my painful seeing,"
2080,INDOLENCE,And faery fancy leaves her habitation
2081,INDOLENCE,To desolation.
2082,INDOLENCE,
2083,INDOLENCE,Of two things open left for lovers parted
2084,INDOLENCE,’Twas thine to scorn the past and go lighthearted:
2085,INDOLENCE,"But I would ever dream I still possess it,"
2086,INDOLENCE,And thus caress it.

2090,INDOLENCE,
2091,INDOLENCE,12
2092,INDOLENCE,
2093,INDOLENCE,
2094,INDOLENCE,Thou didst delight my eyes:
2095,INDOLENCE,Yet who am I? nor first
2096,INDOLENCE,"Nor last nor best, that durst"
2097,INDOLENCE,Once dream of thee for prize;
2098,INDOLENCE,Nor this the only time
2099,INDOLENCE,Thou shalt set love to rhyme.
2100,INDOLENCE,
2101,INDOLENCE,Thou didst delight my ear:
2102,INDOLENCE,Ah! little praise; thy voice
2103,INDOLENCE,"Makes other hearts rejoice,"
2104,INDOLENCE,Makes all ears glad that hear;
2105,INDOLENCE,"And short my joy: but yet,"
2106,INDOLENCE,"O song, do not forget."
2107,INDOLENCE,
2108,INDOLENCE,For what wert thou to me?
2109,INDOLENCE,"How shall I say? The moon,"
2110,INDOLENCE,That poured her midnight noon
2111,INDOLENCE,Upon his wrecking sea;—
2112,INDOLENCE,"A sail, that for a day"
2113,INDOLENCE,Has cheered the castaway.

2119,INDOLENCE,
2120,INDOLENCE,
2121,INDOLENCE,"Joy, sweetest lifeborn joy, where dost thou dwell?"
2122,INDOLENCE,Upon the formless moments of our being
2123,INDOLENCE,"Flitting, to mock the ear that heareth well,"
2124,INDOLENCE,"To escape the trainèd eye that strains in seeing,"
2125,INDOLENCE,Dost thou fly with us whither we are fleeing;
2126,INDOLENCE,"Or home in our creations, to withstand"
2127,INDOLENCE,"Blackwingèd death, that slays the making hand?"
2128,INDOLENCE,
2129,INDOLENCE,"The making mind, that must untimely perish"
2130,INDOLENCE,"Amidst its work which time may not destroy,"
2131,INDOLENCE,"The beauteous forms which man shall love to cherish,"
2132,INDOLENCE,The glorious songs that combat earth’s annoy?
2133,INDOLENCE,"Thou dost dwell here, I know, divinest Joy:"
2134,INDOLENCE,"But they who build thy towers fair and strong,"
2135,INDOLENCE,"Of all that toil, feel most of care and wrong."
2136,INDOLENCE,
2137,INDOLENCE,"Sense is so tender, O and hope so high,"
2138,INDOLENCE,That common pleasures mock their hope and sense;
2139,INDOLENCE,And swifter than doth lightning from the sky
2140,INDOLENCE,"The ecstasy they pine for flashes hence,"
2141,INDOLENCE,"Leaving the darkness and the woe immense,"
2142,INDOLENCE,"Wherewith it seems no thread of life was woven,"
2143,INDOLENCE,Nor doth the track remain where once ’twas cloven.
2144,INDOLENCE,
2145,INDOLENCE,And heaven and all the stable elements
2146,INDOLENCE,"That guard God’s purpose mock us, though the mind"
2147,INDOLENCE,Be spent in searching: for his old intents
2148,INDOLENCE,We see were never for our joy designed:
2149,INDOLENCE,"They shine as doth the bright sun on the blind,"
2150,INDOLENCE,"Or like his pensioned stars, that hymn above"
2151,INDOLENCE,"His praise, but not toward us, that God is Love."
2152,INDOLENCE,
2153,INDOLENCE,For who so well hath wooed the maiden hours
2154,INDOLENCE,"As quite to have won the worth of their rich show,"
2155,INDOLENCE,"To rob the night of mystery, or the flowers"
2156,INDOLENCE,Of their sweet delicacy ere they go?
2157,INDOLENCE,"Nay, even the dear occasion when we know,"
2158,INDOLENCE,"We miss the joy, and on the gliding day"
2159,INDOLENCE,The special glories float and pass away.
2160,INDOLENCE,
2161,INDOLENCE,Only life’s common plod: still to repair
2162,INDOLENCE,The body and the thing which perisheth:
2163,INDOLENCE,"The soil, the smutch, the toil and ache and wear,"
2164,INDOLENCE,"The grinding enginry of blood and breath,"
2165,INDOLENCE,"Pain’s random darts, the heartless spade of death;"
2166,INDOLENCE,"All is but grief, and heavily we call"
2167,INDOLENCE,On the last terror for the end of all.
2168,INDOLENCE,
2169,INDOLENCE,Then comes the happy moment: not a stir
2170,INDOLENCE,"In any tree, no portent in the sky:"
2171,INDOLENCE,"The morn doth neither hasten nor defer,"
2172,INDOLENCE,"The morrow hath no name to call it by,"
2173,INDOLENCE,"But life and joy are one,—we know not why,—"
2174,INDOLENCE,As though our very blood long breathless lain
2175,INDOLENCE,Had tasted of the breath of God again.
2176,INDOLENCE,
2177,INDOLENCE,"And having tasted it I speak of it,"
2178,INDOLENCE,And praise him thinking how I trembled then
2179,INDOLENCE,"When his touch strengthened me, as now I sit"
2180,INDOLENCE,"In wonder, reaching out beyond my ken,"
2181,INDOLENCE,"Reaching to turn the day back, and my pen"
2182,INDOLENCE,Urging to tell a tale which told would seem
2183,INDOLENCE,The witless phantasy of them that dream.
2184,INDOLENCE,
2185,INDOLENCE,"But O most blessèd truth, for truth thou art,"
2186,INDOLENCE,Abide thou with me till my life shall end.
2187,INDOLENCE,Divinity hath surely touched my heart;
2188,INDOLENCE,I have possessed more joy than earth can lend:
2189,INDOLENCE,I may attain what time shall never spend.
2190,INDOLENCE,Only let not my duller days destroy
2191,INDOLENCE,The memory of thy witness and my joy.

2201,INDOLENCE,And from the hour when she doth rise
2202,INDOLENCE,"Till when she sets, none else will see."
2203,INDOLENCE,
2204,INDOLENCE,"One only other ray she hath,"
2205,INDOLENCE,"That makes an angle close with mine,"
2206,INDOLENCE,And glancing down its happy path
2207,INDOLENCE,Upon another spot doth shine.
2208,INDOLENCE,
2209,INDOLENCE,"But that ray too is sent to me,"
2210,INDOLENCE,For where it lights there dwells my heart:
2211,INDOLENCE,"And if I were where I would be,"
2212,INDOLENCE,"Both rays would shine, love, where thou art."

2221,INDOLENCE,"The darkness silvers away, the morn doth break,"
2222,INDOLENCE,It leaps in the sky: unrisen lustres slake
2223,INDOLENCE,"The o’ertaken moon. Awake, O heart, awake!"
2224,INDOLENCE,
2225,INDOLENCE,She too that loveth awaketh and hopes for thee;
2226,INDOLENCE,"Her eyes already have sped the shades that flee,"
2227,INDOLENCE,Already they watch the path thy feet shall take:
2228,INDOLENCE,"Awake, O heart, to be loved, awake, awake!"
2229,INDOLENCE,
2230,INDOLENCE,"And if thou tarry her,—if this could be,—"
2231,INDOLENCE,"She cometh herself, O heart, to be loved, to thee;"
2232,INDOLENCE,For thee would unashamèd herself forsake:
2233,INDOLENCE,"Awake to be loved, my heart, awake, awake!"
2234,INDOLENCE,
2235,INDOLENCE,"Awake, the land is scattered with light, and see,"
2236,INDOLENCE,Uncanopied sleep is flying from field and tree:
2237,INDOLENCE,And blossoming boughs of April in laughter shake;
2238,INDOLENCE,"Awake, O heart, to be loved, awake, awake!"
2239,INDOLENCE,
2240,INDOLENCE,Lo all things wake and tarry and look for thee:
2241,INDOLENCE,"She looketh and saith, ’O sun, now bring him to me."
2242,INDOLENCE,"Come more adored, O adored, for his coming’s sake,"
2243,INDOLENCE,"And awake my heart to be loved: awake, awake!’"

2376,BOOK IV,
2377,BOOK IV,I too will something make
2378,BOOK IV,And joy in the making;

2404,BOOK IV,My jealous ears grew whist;—

2406,BOOK IV,"Music from heaven is’t,"
2407,BOOK IV,Sent for our joy?
2408,BOOK IV,
2409,BOOK IV,She also came and heard;

2429,BOOK IV,
2430,BOOK IV,Their shadows fly along the hill

2803,THE WINDMILL,On the gliding stream
2804,THE WINDMILL,Writes her scattered dream:
2805,THE WINDMILL,
2806,THE WINDMILL,"Angel spirits of sleep,"
2807,THE WINDMILL,Dancing to the weir

2811,THE WINDMILL,That ye haunt no more
2812,THE WINDMILL,Isle and grassy shore
2813,THE WINDMILL,With your moonlit play;

2831,ANNIVERSARY,—If it should be what best I know!
2832,ANNIVERSARY,
2833,ANNIVERSARY,What is richer than thoughts that stray
2834,ANNIVERSARY,From reading of poems that smoothly flow?
2835,ANNIVERSARY,What is solemn like the delay
2836,ANNIVERSARY,Of concords linked in a music slow
2837,ANNIVERSARY,Dying thro’ vaulted aisles away?
2838,ANNIVERSARY,—If it should be what best I know!
2839,ANNIVERSARY,
2840,ANNIVERSARY,"What gives faith to me when I pray,"
2841,ANNIVERSARY,"Setteth my heart with joy aglow,"

2846,ANNIVERSARY,
2847,ANNIVERSARY,But tell me thou—’twas on this day
2848,ANNIVERSARY,That first we loved five years ago—

2861,ANNIVERSARY,Across the country side.
2862,ANNIVERSARY,
2863,ANNIVERSARY,His scourge of fury is lashing down
2864,ANNIVERSARY,"The delicate-rankèd golden corn,"
2865,ANNIVERSARY,That never more shall rear its crown
2866,ANNIVERSARY,And curtsey to the morn.
2867,ANNIVERSARY,
2868,ANNIVERSARY,There shews no care in heaven to save
2869,ANNIVERSARY,"Man’s pitiful patience, or provide"
2870,ANNIVERSARY,"A season for the season’s slave,"

2872,ANNIVERSARY,
2873,ANNIVERSARY,"So my proud spirit in me is sad,"

2887,ANNIVERSARY,Of budding May’s rejoicing train.
2888,ANNIVERSARY,
2889,ANNIVERSARY,"Like autumn flowers that brave the frost,"
2890,ANNIVERSARY,"And make their show when hope is lost,"
2891,ANNIVERSARY,These ’mong the fruits and mellow scent
2892,ANNIVERSARY,Mourn not the high-sunned summer spent.
2893,ANNIVERSARY,
2894,ANNIVERSARY,Their notes thro’ all the jocund spring
2895,ANNIVERSARY,Were mixed in merry musicking:
2896,ANNIVERSARY,"They sang for love the whole day long,"
2897,ANNIVERSARY,But now their love is all for song.
2898,ANNIVERSARY,
2899,ANNIVERSARY,Now each hath perfected his lay
2900,ANNIVERSARY,To praise the year that hastes away:
2901,ANNIVERSARY,"They sit on boughs apart, and vie"
2902,ANNIVERSARY,In single songs and rich reply:
2903,ANNIVERSARY,
2904,ANNIVERSARY,And oft as in the copse I hear
2905,ANNIVERSARY,"These anthems of the dying year,"
2906,ANNIVERSARY,"The passions, once her peace that stole,"
2907,ANNIVERSARY,With flattering love my heart console.

2915,ANNIVERSARY,"When my love was away,"
2916,ANNIVERSARY,"Full three days were not sped,"
2917,ANNIVERSARY,I caught my fancy astray
2918,ANNIVERSARY,"Thinking if she were dead,"
2919,ANNIVERSARY,
2920,ANNIVERSARY,"And I alone, alone:"
2921,ANNIVERSARY,It seemed in my misery
2922,ANNIVERSARY,In all the world was none
2923,ANNIVERSARY,Ever so lone as I.
2924,ANNIVERSARY,
2925,ANNIVERSARY,I wept; but it did not shame
2926,ANNIVERSARY,Nor comfort my heart: away
2927,ANNIVERSARY,"I rode as I might, and came"
2928,ANNIVERSARY,To my love at close of day.
2929,ANNIVERSARY,
2930,ANNIVERSARY,"The sight of her stilled my fears,"
2931,ANNIVERSARY,My fairest-hearted love:
2932,ANNIVERSARY,And yet in her eyes were tears:
2933,ANNIVERSARY,"Which when I questioned of,"
2934,ANNIVERSARY,
2935,ANNIVERSARY,"O now thou art come, she cried,"
2936,ANNIVERSARY,’Tis fled: but I thought to-day
2937,ANNIVERSARY,"I never could here abide,"

2946,ANNIVERSARY,"The storm is over, the land hushes to rest:"
2947,ANNIVERSARY,"The tyrannous wind, its strength fordone,"
2948,ANNIVERSARY,Is fallen back in the west
2949,ANNIVERSARY,To couch with the sinking sun.
2950,ANNIVERSARY,The last clouds fare
2951,ANNIVERSARY,"With fainting speed, and their thin streamers fly"
2952,ANNIVERSARY,In melting drifts of the sky.
2953,ANNIVERSARY,Already the birds in the air
2954,ANNIVERSARY,"Appear again; the rooks return to their haunt,"
2955,ANNIVERSARY,"And one by one,"
2956,ANNIVERSARY,"Proclaiming aloud their care,"
2957,ANNIVERSARY,Renew their peaceful chant.
2958,ANNIVERSARY,
2959,ANNIVERSARY,"Torn and shattered the trees their branches again reset,"
2960,ANNIVERSARY,They trim afresh the fair
2961,ANNIVERSARY,"Few green and golden leaves withheld the storm,"
2962,ANNIVERSARY,And awhile will be handsome yet.
2963,ANNIVERSARY,To-morrow’s sun shall caress
2964,ANNIVERSARY,Their remnant of loveliness:
2965,ANNIVERSARY,In quiet days for a time
2966,ANNIVERSARY,Sad Autumn lingering warm
2967,ANNIVERSARY,Shall humour their faded prime.
2968,ANNIVERSARY,
2969,ANNIVERSARY,But ah! the leaves of summer that lie on the ground!
2970,ANNIVERSARY,"What havoc! The laughing timbrels of June,"
2971,ANNIVERSARY,"That curtained the birds’ cradles, and screened their song,"
2972,ANNIVERSARY,"That sheltered the cooing doves at noon,"
2973,ANNIVERSARY,"Of airy fans the delicate throng,—"
2974,ANNIVERSARY,Torn and scattered around:
2975,ANNIVERSARY,"Far out afield they lie,"
2976,ANNIVERSARY,"In the watery furrows die,"
2977,ANNIVERSARY,"In grassy pools of the flood they sink and drown,"
2978,ANNIVERSARY,"Green-golden, orange, vermilion, golden and brown,"
2979,ANNIVERSARY,The high year’s flaunting crown
2980,ANNIVERSARY,Shattered and trampled down.
2981,ANNIVERSARY,
2982,ANNIVERSARY,The day is done: the tired land looks for night:
2983,ANNIVERSARY,She prays to the night to keep
2984,ANNIVERSARY,In peace her nerves of delight:
2985,ANNIVERSARY,"While silver mist upstealeth silently,"
2986,ANNIVERSARY,And the broad cloud-driving moon in the clear sky
2987,ANNIVERSARY,"Lifts o’er the firs her shining shield,"
2988,ANNIVERSARY,And in her tranquil light
2989,ANNIVERSARY,Sleep falls on forest and field.
2990,ANNIVERSARY,Sée! sléep hath fallen: the trees are asleep:
2991,ANNIVERSARY,The night is come. The land is wrapt in sleep.

2999,ANNIVERSARY,"Ye thrilled me once, ye mournful strains,"
3000,ANNIVERSARY,"Ye anthems of plaintive woe,"
3001,ANNIVERSARY,My spirit was sad when I was young;
3002,ANNIVERSARY,Ah sorrowful long-ago!
3003,ANNIVERSARY,But since I have found the beauty of joy
3004,ANNIVERSARY,I have done with proud dismay:
3005,ANNIVERSARY,For howsoe’er man hug his care
3006,ANNIVERSARY,The best of his art is gay.
3007,ANNIVERSARY,
3008,ANNIVERSARY,And yet if voices of fancy’s choir
3009,ANNIVERSARY,Again in mine ear awake
3010,ANNIVERSARY,"Your old lament, ’tis dear to me still,"
3011,ANNIVERSARY,Nor all for memory’s sake:
3012,ANNIVERSARY,"’Tis like the dirge of sorrow dead,"
3013,ANNIVERSARY,Whose tears are wiped away;
3014,ANNIVERSARY,"Or drops of the shower when rain is o’er,"
3015,ANNIVERSARY,That jewel the brightened day.

3024,ANNIVERSARY,"So pale and worn and thin,"
3025,ANNIVERSARY,"Who passeth here, and passeth there,"
3026,ANNIVERSARY,And looketh out and in?
3027,ANNIVERSARY,
3028,ANNIVERSARY,"That useth not our garb nor tongue,"
3029,ANNIVERSARY,And knoweth things untold:
3030,ANNIVERSARY,"Who teacheth pleasure to the young,"
3031,ANNIVERSARY,And wisdom to the old?
3032,ANNIVERSARY,
3033,ANNIVERSARY,"No toil he maketh his by day,"
3034,ANNIVERSARY,No home his own by night;
3035,ANNIVERSARY,"But wheresoe’er he take his way,"
3036,ANNIVERSARY,He killeth our delight.
3037,ANNIVERSARY,
3038,ANNIVERSARY,Since he is come there’s nothing wise
3039,ANNIVERSARY,"Nor fair in man or child,"
3040,ANNIVERSARY,Unless his deep divining eyes
3041,ANNIVERSARY,Have looked on it and smiled.
3042,ANNIVERSARY,
3043,ANNIVERSARY,Whence came he hither all alone
3044,ANNIVERSARY,Among our folk to spy?
3045,ANNIVERSARY,"There’s nought that we can call our own,"
3046,ANNIVERSARY,Till he shall hap to die.
3047,ANNIVERSARY,
3048,ANNIVERSARY,And I would dig his grave full deep
3049,ANNIVERSARY,"Beneath the churchyard yew,"
3050,ANNIVERSARY,Lest thence his wizard eyes might peep
3051,ANNIVERSARY,To mark the things we do.

3062,ANNIVERSARY,Or ever he think.
3063,ANNIVERSARY,
3064,ANNIVERSARY,"His mouth to the bowl,"
3065,ANNIVERSARY,His feet to the fire;
3066,ANNIVERSARY,"And let him, good soul,"
3067,ANNIVERSARY,No comfort desire.
3068,ANNIVERSARY,
3069,ANNIVERSARY,"So merry he be,"

3083,ANNIVERSARY,The day is dark and black the sea.
3084,ANNIVERSARY,Shorn of their crests the blighted waves
3085,ANNIVERSARY,With driven foam the offing fleck:
3086,ANNIVERSARY,The ebb is low and barely laves
3087,ANNIVERSARY,The red rust of the giant wreck.
3088,ANNIVERSARY,
3089,ANNIVERSARY,"On such a stony, breaking beach"
3090,ANNIVERSARY,My childhood chanced and chose to be:
3091,ANNIVERSARY,"’Twas here I played, and musing made"
3092,ANNIVERSARY,My friend the melancholy sea.
3093,ANNIVERSARY,He from his dim enchanted caves
3094,ANNIVERSARY,With shuddering roar and onrush wild
3095,ANNIVERSARY,Fell down in sacrificial waves
3096,ANNIVERSARY,At feet of his exulting child.
3097,ANNIVERSARY,
3098,ANNIVERSARY,Unto a spirit too light for fear
3099,ANNIVERSARY,"His wrath was mirth, his wail was glee:—"
3100,ANNIVERSARY,My heart is now too fixed to bow
3101,ANNIVERSARY,Tho’ all his tempests howl at me:
3102,ANNIVERSARY,"For to the gain life’s summer saves,"
3103,ANNIVERSARY,"My solemn joy’s increasing store,"
3104,ANNIVERSARY,The tossing of his mournful waves
3105,ANNIVERSARY,Makes sweetest music evermore.

3116,ANNIVERSARY,"Her graces over me,"
3117,ANNIVERSARY,
3118,ANNIVERSARY,In the life-kindling fold
3119,ANNIVERSARY,"Of God’s breath; where on high,"
3120,ANNIVERSARY,In furthest space untold
3121,ANNIVERSARY,Like a lost world I lie:
3122,ANNIVERSARY,
3123,ANNIVERSARY,And o’er my dreaming plains
3124,ANNIVERSARY,"Lightens, most pale and fair,"
3125,ANNIVERSARY,A moon that never wanes;
3126,ANNIVERSARY,"Or more, if I compare,"
3127,ANNIVERSARY,
3128,ANNIVERSARY,Like what the shepherd sees
3129,ANNIVERSARY,"On late mid-winter dawns,"
3130,ANNIVERSARY,"When thro’ the branchèd trees,"
3131,ANNIVERSARY,"O’er the white-frosted lawns,"

3149,ANNIVERSARY,"My servant, my pretty minion."
3150,ANNIVERSARY,
3151,ANNIVERSARY,"Now indeed I have cause to mourn,"

3198,THE WINNOWERS,Betwixt two billows of the downs
3199,THE WINNOWERS,"The little hamlet lies,"
3200,THE WINNOWERS,And nothing sees but the bald crowns
3201,THE WINNOWERS,"Of the hills, and the blue skies."
3202,THE WINNOWERS,
3203,THE WINNOWERS,Clustering beneath the long descent
3204,THE WINNOWERS,"And grey slopes of the wold,"

3206,THE WINNOWERS,With lichen yellow as gold.

3208,THE WINNOWERS,We found it in the mid-day sun
3209,THE WINNOWERS,"Basking, what time of year"
3210,THE WINNOWERS,"The thrush his singing has begun,"
3211,THE WINNOWERS,Ere the first leaves appear.
3212,THE WINNOWERS,
3213,THE WINNOWERS,High from his load a woodman pitched
3214,THE WINNOWERS,His faggots on the stack:
3215,THE WINNOWERS,Knee-deep in straw the cattle twitched
3216,THE WINNOWERS,Sweet hay from crib and rack:
3217,THE WINNOWERS,
3218,THE WINNOWERS,And from the barn hard by was borne
3219,THE WINNOWERS,"A steady muffled din,"
3220,THE WINNOWERS,By which we knew that threshèd corn
3221,THE WINNOWERS,"Was winnowing, and went in."
3222,THE WINNOWERS,

3224,THE WINNOWERS,"Streamed through the open door,"

3232,THE WINNOWERS,
3233,THE WINNOWERS,"We watched the good grain rattle down,"
3234,THE WINNOWERS,And the awns fly in the draught;
3235,THE WINNOWERS,To see us both so pensive grown
3236,THE WINNOWERS,The honest labourers laughed:
3237,THE WINNOWERS,
3238,THE WINNOWERS,"Merry they were, because the wheat"
3239,THE WINNOWERS,"Was clean and plump and good,"

3247,THE WINNOWERS,
3248,THE WINNOWERS,But here we found ourselves again.

3332,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Into the garden saileth,"
3333,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Scarce here and there stirring the single trees,"
3334,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,For his sharpness he vaileth:
3335,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"So long a comrade of the bearded corn,"
3336,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Now from the stubbles whence the shocks are borne,"
3337,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"O’er dewy lawns he turns to stray,"
3338,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,As mindful of the kisses and soft play
3339,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Wherewith he enamoured the light-hearted May,"
3340,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,Ere he deserted her;

3343,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Nor spicy pink,"
3344,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Nor summer’s rose, nor garnered lavender,"
3345,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,But the few lingering scents
3346,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Of streakèd pea, and gillyflower, and stocks"
3347,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Of courtly purple, and aromatic phlox."
3348,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,
3349,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,And at all times to hear are drowsy tones
3350,THE GARDEN IN SEPTEMBER,"Of dizzy flies, and humming drones,"

3526,A ROBIN,"Of the leafless oak, what singest thou?"
3527,A ROBIN,Hark! he telleth how—
3528,A ROBIN,’Spring is coming now; Spring is coming now.
3529,A ROBIN,
3530,A ROBIN,"Now ruddy are the elm-tops against the blue sky,"
3531,A ROBIN,The pale larch donneth her jewelry;
3532,A ROBIN,"Red fir and black fir sigh,"
3533,A ROBIN,And I am lamenting the year gone by.
3534,A ROBIN,
3535,A ROBIN,"The bushes where I nested are all cut down,"
3536,A ROBIN,"They are felling the tall trees one by one,"
3537,A ROBIN,"And my mate is dead and gone,"
3538,A ROBIN,In the winter she died and left me lone.
3539,A ROBIN,
3540,A ROBIN,She lay in the thicket where I fear to go;
3541,A ROBIN,For when the March-winds after the snow
3542,A ROBIN,"The leaves away did blow,"
3543,A ROBIN,"She was not there, and my heart is woe:"
3544,A ROBIN,
3545,A ROBIN,"And sad is my song, when I begin to sing,"
3546,A ROBIN,As I sit in the sunshine this merry spring:
3547,A ROBIN,Like a withered leaf I cling
3548,A ROBIN,"To the white oak-bough, while the wood doth ring."
3549,A ROBIN,
3550,A ROBIN,"Spring is coming now, the sun again is gay;"
3551,A ROBIN,Each day like a last spring’s happy day.’—

3564,A ROBIN,And sheeted in a desolate plain
3565,A ROBIN,The country side.
3566,A ROBIN,
3567,A ROBIN,The trees with silvery rime bedight
3568,A ROBIN,Their branches bare.
3569,A ROBIN,By day no sun appeared; by night
3570,A ROBIN,The hidden moon shed thievish light
3571,A ROBIN,In the misty air.
3572,A ROBIN,
3573,A ROBIN,We fed the birds that flew around
3574,A ROBIN,In flocks to be fed:
3575,A ROBIN,No shelter in holly or brake they found.
3576,A ROBIN,The speckled thrush on the frozen ground
3577,A ROBIN,Lay frozen and dead.
3578,A ROBIN,
3579,A ROBIN,We skated on stream and pond; we cut
3580,A ROBIN,The crinching snow
3581,A ROBIN,To Doric temple or Arctic hut;
3582,A ROBIN,"We laughed and sang at nightfall, shut"
3583,A ROBIN,By the fireside glow.
3584,A ROBIN,
3585,A ROBIN,Yet grudged we our keen delights before
3586,A ROBIN,Maurice should come.
3587,A ROBIN,"We said, In-door or out-of-door"
3588,A ROBIN,"We shall love life for a month or more,"
3589,A ROBIN,When he is home.
3590,A ROBIN,
3591,A ROBIN,They brought him home; ’twas two days late
3592,A ROBIN,For Christmas day:
3593,A ROBIN,"Wrapped in white, in solemn state,"
3594,A ROBIN,"A flower in his hand, all still and straight"
3595,A ROBIN,Our Maurice lay.
3596,A ROBIN,
3597,A ROBIN,And two days ere the year outgave
3598,A ROBIN,We laid him low.
3599,A ROBIN,"The best of us truly were not brave,"

4471,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Its leafy walls, beneath its arching green;"
4472,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Fairer than dream of sleep, than Hope more fair"
4473,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Leading to dreamless sleep her sister Care.
4474,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4475,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"There grew two fellow limes, two rising trees,"
4476,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Shadowing the lawn, the summer haunt of bees,"
4477,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Whose stems, engraved with many a russet scar"
4478,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"From the spear-hurlings of our mimic war,"
4479,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Pillar’d the portico to that wide walk,"
4480,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,A mossy terrace of the native chalk
4481,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Fashion’d, that led thro’ the dark shades around"
4482,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Straight to the wooden temple on the mound.
4483,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"There live the memories of my early days,"
4484,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,There still with childish heart my spirit plays;
4485,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Yea, terror-stricken by the fiend despair"
4486,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"When she hath fled me, I have found her there;"
4487,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"And there ’tis ever noon, and glad suns bring"
4488,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Alternate days of summer and of spring,"
4489,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"With childish thought, and childish faces bright,"
4490,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And all unknown save but the hour’s delight.
4491,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4492,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"High on the mound the ivied arbour stood,"
4493,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,A dome of straw upheld on rustic wood:
4494,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Hidden in fern the steps of the ascent,"
4495,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Whereby unto the southern front we went,"
4496,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"And from the dark plantation climbing free,"
4497,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Over a valley look’d out on the sea.
4498,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"That sea is ever bright and blue, the sky"
4499,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Serene and blue, and ever white ships lie"
4500,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"High on the horizon steadfast in full sail,"
4501,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Or nearer in the roads pass within hail
4502,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Of naked brigs and barques that windbound ride
4503,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,At their taut cables heading to the tide.
4504,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4505,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"There many an hour I have sat to watch; nay, now"
4506,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The brazen disk is cold against my brow,"
4507,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And in my sight a circle of the sea
4508,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Enlarged to swiftness, where the salt waves flee,"
4509,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And ships in stately motion pass so near
4510,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,That what I see is speaking to my ear:
4511,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"I hear the waves dash and the tackle strain,"
4512,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The canvas flap, the rattle of the chain"
4513,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"That runs out thro’ the hawse, the clank of the wind"
4514,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Winding the rusty cable inch by inch,"
4515,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Till half I wonder if they have no care,"
4516,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Those sailors, that my glass is brought to bear"
4517,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"On all their doings, if I vex them not"
4518,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,On every petty task of their rough lot
4519,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Prying and spying, searching every craft"
4520,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"From painted truck to gunnel, fore and aft,—"
4521,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Thro’ idle Sundays as I have watch’d them lean
4522,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Long hours upon the rail, or neath its screen"
4523,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Prone on the deck to lie outstretch’d at length,"
4524,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Sunk in renewal of their wearied strength.
4525,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4526,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"But what a feast of joy to me, if some"
4527,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Fast-sailing frigate to the Channel come
4528,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Back’d here her topsail, or brought gently up"
4529,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Let from her bow the splashing anchor drop,"
4530,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"By faint contrary wind stay’d in her cruise,"
4531,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The _Phaethon_ or dancing _Arethuse_,"
4532,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Or some immense three-decker of the line,"
4533,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Romantic as the tale of Troy divine;
4534,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Ere yet our iron age had doom’d to fall
4535,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The towering freeboard of the wooden wall,"
4536,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And for the engines of a mightier Mars
4537,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Clipp’d their wide wings, and dock’d their soaring spars."
4538,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The gale that in their tackle sang, the wave"
4539,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,That neath their gilded galleries dasht so brave
4540,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Lost then their merriment, nor look to play"
4541,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,With the heavy-hearted monsters of to-day.
4542,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4543,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,One noon in March upon that anchoring ground
4544,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Came Napier’s fleet unto the Baltic bound:
4545,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Cloudless the sky and calm and blue the sea,"
4546,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"As round Saint Margaret’s cliff mysteriously,"
4547,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Those murderous queens walking in Sabbath sleep
4548,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Glided in line upon the windless deep:
4549,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,For in those days was first seen low and black
4550,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Beside the full-rigg’d mast the strange smoke-stack,"
4551,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And neath their stern revolv’d the twisted fan.
4552,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Many I knew as soon as I might scan,"
4553,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The heavy _Royal George_, the _Acre_ bright,"
4554,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The _Hogue_ and _Ajax_, and could name aright"
4555,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Others that I remember now no more;
4556,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"But chief, her blue flag flying at the fore,"
4557,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"With fighting guns a hundred thirty and one,"
4558,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The Admiral ship _The Duke of Wellington_,"
4559,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Whereon sail’d George, who in her gig had flown"
4560,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,The silken ensign by our sisters sewn.
4561,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The iron Duke himself,—whose soldier fame"
4562,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"To England’s proudest ship had given her name,"
4563,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And whose white hairs in this my earliest scene
4564,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Had scarce more honour’d than accustom’d been,—"
4565,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Was two years since to his last haven past:
4566,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,I had seen his castle-flag to fall half-mast
4567,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"One morn as I sat looking on the sea,"
4568,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"When thus all England’s grief came first to me,"
4569,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Who hold my childhood favour’d that I knew
4570,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,So well the face that won at Waterloo.
4571,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4572,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"But now ’tis other wars, and other men;—"
4573,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The year that Napier sail’d, my years were ten—"
4574,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Yea, and new homes and loves my heart hath found:"
4575,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"A priest has there usurped the ivied mound,"
4576,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The bell that call’d to horse calls now to prayers,"
4577,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And silent nuns tread the familiar stairs.
4578,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Within the peach-clad walls that old outlaw,"
4579,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The Roman wolf, scratches with privy paw."

4588,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Complain of thee often,"
4589,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Because thou dost soften
4590,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,My being to pain:
4591,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4592,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Thou makest me fear
4593,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"The mind that createth,"
4594,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,That loves not nor hateth
4595,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,In justice austere;
4596,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4597,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Who, ere he make one,"
4598,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"With millions toyeth,"
4599,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And lightly destroyeth
4600,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,Whatever is begun.
4601,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4602,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"An’ wer’t not for thee,"
4603,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"My glorious passion,"
4604,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,My heart I could fashion
4605,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"To sternness, as he."
4606,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4607,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"But thee, Love, he made"
4608,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Lest man should defy him,"
4609,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Connive and outvie him,"
4610,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And not be afraid:
4611,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,
4612,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"Nay, thee, Love, he gave"
4613,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,"His terrors to cover,"
4614,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,And turn to a lover
4615,THE SUMMER-HOUSE ON THE MOUND,His insolent slave.

4623,THE SOUTH WIND,
4624,THE SOUTH WIND,
4625,THE SOUTH WIND,"The south wind rose at dusk of the winter day,"
4626,THE SOUTH WIND,The warm breath of the western sea
4627,THE SOUTH WIND,"Circling wrapp’d the isle with his cloke of cloud,"
4628,THE SOUTH WIND,"And it now reach’d even to me, at dusk of the day,"
4629,THE SOUTH WIND,And moan’d in the branches aloud:
4630,THE SOUTH WIND,"While here and there, in patches of dark space,"
4631,THE SOUTH WIND,"A star shone forth from its heavenly place,"
4632,THE SOUTH WIND,As a spark that is borne in the smoky chase;
4633,THE SOUTH WIND,"And, looking up, there fell on my face—"
4634,THE SOUTH WIND,Could it be drops of rain
4635,THE SOUTH WIND,"Soft as the wind, that fell on my face?"
4636,THE SOUTH WIND,"Gossamers light as threads of the summer dawn,"
4637,THE SOUTH WIND,"Suck’d by the sun from midmost calms of the main,"
4638,THE SOUTH WIND,"From groves of coral islands secretly drawn,"
4639,THE SOUTH WIND,"O’er half the round of earth to be driven,"
4640,THE SOUTH WIND,Now to fall on my face
4641,THE SOUTH WIND,In silky skeins spun from the mists of heaven.
4642,THE SOUTH WIND,
4643,THE SOUTH WIND,"Who art thou, in wind and darkness and soft rain"
4644,THE SOUTH WIND,"Thyself that robest, that bendest in sighing pines"
4645,THE SOUTH WIND,To whisper thy truth? that usest for signs
4646,THE SOUTH WIND,"A hurried glimpse of the moon, the glance of a star"
4647,THE SOUTH WIND,In the rifted sky?
4648,THE SOUTH WIND,"Who art thou, that with thee I"
4649,THE SOUTH WIND,Woo and am wooed?
4650,THE SOUTH WIND,That robing thyself in darkness and soft rain
4651,THE SOUTH WIND,"Choosest my chosen solitude,"
4652,THE SOUTH WIND,Coming so far
4653,THE SOUTH WIND,"To tell thy secret again,"
4654,THE SOUTH WIND,"As a mother her child, in her folding arm"
4655,THE SOUTH WIND,"Of a winter night by a flickering fire,"
4656,THE SOUTH WIND,Telleth the same tale o’er and o’er
4657,THE SOUTH WIND,"With gentle voice, and I never tire,"
4658,THE SOUTH WIND,"So imperceptibly changeth the charm,"
4659,THE SOUTH WIND,"As Love on buried ecstasy buildeth his tower,"
4660,THE SOUTH WIND,—Like as the stem that beareth the flower
4661,THE SOUTH WIND,By trembling is knit to power;—
4662,THE SOUTH WIND,Ah! long ago
4663,THE SOUTH WIND,"In thy first rapture I renounced my lot,"
4664,THE SOUTH WIND,"The vanity, the despondency and the woe,"
4665,THE SOUTH WIND,And seeking thee to know
4666,THE SOUTH WIND,"Well was’t for me, and evermore"
4667,THE SOUTH WIND,"I am thine, I know not what."
4668,THE SOUTH WIND,
4669,THE SOUTH WIND,"For me thou seekest ever, me wondering a day"
4670,THE SOUTH WIND,"In the eternal alternations, me"
4671,THE SOUTH WIND,Free for a stolen moment of chance
4672,THE SOUTH WIND,To dream a beautiful dream
4673,THE SOUTH WIND,In the everlasting dance
4674,THE SOUTH WIND,"Of speechless worlds, the unsearchable scheme,"
4675,THE SOUTH WIND,"To me thou findest the way,"
4676,THE SOUTH WIND,Me and whomsoe’er
4677,THE SOUTH WIND,I have found my dream to share
4678,THE SOUTH WIND,Still with thy charm encircling; even to-night
4679,THE SOUTH WIND,To me and my love in darkness and soft rain
4680,THE SOUTH WIND,"Under the sighing pines thou comest again,"
4681,THE SOUTH WIND,"And staying our speech with mystery of delight,"
4682,THE SOUTH WIND,"Of the kiss that I give a wonder thou makest,"
4683,THE SOUTH WIND,And the kiss that I take thou takest.

4691,THE SOUTH WIND,I climb the mossy bank of the glade:
4692,THE SOUTH WIND,My love awaiteth me in the shade.
4693,THE SOUTH WIND,
4694,THE SOUTH WIND,She holdeth a book that she never heedeth:
4695,THE SOUTH WIND,In Goddës work her spirit readeth.
4696,THE SOUTH WIND,
4697,THE SOUTH WIND,"She is all to me, and I to her:"
4698,THE SOUTH WIND,"When we embrace, the stars confer."
4699,THE SOUTH WIND,
4700,THE SOUTH WIND,"O my love, from beyond the sky"
4701,THE SOUTH WIND,"I am calling thy heart, and who but I?"
4702,THE SOUTH WIND,
4703,THE SOUTH WIND,
4704,THE SOUTH WIND,"Fresh as love is the breeze of June,"
4705,THE SOUTH WIND,In the dappled shade of the summer noon.
4706,THE SOUTH WIND,
4707,THE SOUTH WIND,"Catullus, throwing his heart away,"
4708,THE SOUTH WIND,Gave fewer kisses every day.
4709,THE SOUTH WIND,
4710,THE SOUTH WIND,"Heracleitus, spending his youth"
4711,THE SOUTH WIND,"In search of wisdom, had less of truth."
4712,THE SOUTH WIND,
4713,THE SOUTH WIND,Flame of fire was the poet’s desire:
4714,THE SOUTH WIND,The thinker found that life was fire.
4715,THE SOUTH WIND,
4716,THE SOUTH WIND,
4717,THE SOUTH WIND,O my love! my song is done:

4729,THE SOUTH WIND,
4730,THE SOUTH WIND,"When in her ear the secret I tell,"
4731,THE SOUTH WIND,She smileth with joy incredible—
4732,THE SOUTH WIND,
4733,THE SOUTH WIND,Ha! she is vain—O Nay—
4734,THE SOUTH WIND,"Then tell us!—Nay, O nay."
4735,THE SOUTH WIND,
4736,THE SOUTH WIND,
4737,THE SOUTH WIND,"But this is in my heart,"
4738,THE SOUTH WIND,"That Love is Nature’s perfect art,"
4739,THE SOUTH WIND,"And man hath got his fancy hence,"
4740,THE SOUTH WIND,To clothe his thought in forms of sense.
4741,THE SOUTH WIND,
4742,THE SOUTH WIND,
4743,THE SOUTH WIND,"Fair are thy works, O man, and fair"
4744,THE SOUTH WIND,"Thy dreams of soul in garments rare,"
4745,THE SOUTH WIND,"Beautiful past compare,"
4746,THE SOUTH WIND,"Yea, godlike when thou hast the skill"
4747,THE SOUTH WIND,To steal a stir of the heavenly thrill:
4748,THE SOUTH WIND,
4749,THE SOUTH WIND,"But O, have care, have care!"
4750,THE SOUTH WIND,’Tis envious even to dare:
4751,THE SOUTH WIND,And many a fiend is watching well
4752,THE SOUTH WIND,To flush thy reed with the fire of hell.

4763,THE SOUTH WIND,
4764,THE SOUTH WIND,My desire and thy desire
4765,THE SOUTH WIND,"Twining to a tongue of fire,"
4766,THE SOUTH WIND,"Leaping live, and laughing higher;"

4779,THE SOUTH WIND,"Gay is life, and sweet is breath:"

4781,THE SOUTH WIND,"This he taught us, this we knew,"
4782,THE SOUTH WIND,"Happy in his science true,"
4783,THE SOUTH WIND,Hand in hand as we stood
4784,THE SOUTH WIND,"Neath the shadows of the wood,"

4876,SEPTUAGESIMA,

4893,SEPTUAGESIMA,Their cluster’d cream:
4894,SEPTUAGESIMA,Robin and wren and amorous thrush
4895,SEPTUAGESIMA,Carol’d above the stream:

5381,DUNSTONE HILL,"Stands on the mountain-moor alone,"
5382,DUNSTONE HILL,High from man’s dwelling on the wide
5383,DUNSTONE HILL,"And solitary mountain-side,"
5384,DUNSTONE HILL,
5385,DUNSTONE HILL,"The purple mountain-side, where all"
5386,DUNSTONE HILL,"The dewy night the meteors fall,"

5399,DUNSTONE HILL,
5400,DUNSTONE HILL,Far down across the valley deep
5401,DUNSTONE HILL,"The town is hid in smoky sleep,"
5402,DUNSTONE HILL,At moonless nightfall wakening slow
5403,DUNSTONE HILL,Upon the dark with lurid glow:
5404,DUNSTONE HILL,
5405,DUNSTONE HILL,"Beyond, afar the widening view"

5410,DUNSTONE HILL,To one who looketh from this hill
5411,DUNSTONE HILL,"Life seems asleep, all is so still:"
5412,DUNSTONE HILL,Nought passeth save the travelling shade

5414,DUNSTONE HILL,
5415,DUNSTONE HILL,Nor since this landscape saw the sun
5416,DUNSTONE HILL,"Might other motion o’er it run,"
5417,DUNSTONE HILL,Till to man’s scheming heart it came

5419,DUNSTONE HILL,
5420,DUNSTONE HILL,Him may you mark in every vale
5421,DUNSTONE HILL,"Moving beneath his fleecy trail,"

5424,DUNSTONE HILL,
5425,DUNSTONE HILL,"He gives the distance life to-day,"
5426,DUNSTONE HILL,Rushing upon his level’d way

5448,SCREAMING TARN,The saddest place that e’er I saw
5449,SCREAMING TARN,Is the deep tarn above the inn
5450,SCREAMING TARN,"That crowns the mountain-road, whereby"
5451,SCREAMING TARN,One southward bound his way must win.
5452,SCREAMING TARN,
5453,SCREAMING TARN,Sunk on the table of the ridge
5454,SCREAMING TARN,From its deep shores is nought to see:
5455,SCREAMING TARN,The unresting wind lashes and chills
5456,SCREAMING TARN,Its shivering ripples ceaselessly.
5457,SCREAMING TARN,
5458,SCREAMING TARN,"Three sides ’tis banked with stones aslant,"
5459,SCREAMING TARN,"And down the fourth the rushes grow,"
5460,SCREAMING TARN,And yellow sedge fringing the edge
5461,SCREAMING TARN,With lengthen’d image all arow.
5462,SCREAMING TARN,
5463,SCREAMING TARN,"’Tis square and black, and on its face"
5464,SCREAMING TARN,"When noon is still, the mirror’d sky"
5465,SCREAMING TARN,Looks dark and further from the earth
5466,SCREAMING TARN,Than when you gaze at it on high.
5467,SCREAMING TARN,
5468,SCREAMING TARN,"At mid of night, if one be there,"
5469,SCREAMING TARN,—So say the people of the hill—
5470,SCREAMING TARN,"A fearful shriek of death is heard,"
5471,SCREAMING TARN,One sudden scream both loud and shrill.
5472,SCREAMING TARN,
5473,SCREAMING TARN,"And some have seen on stilly nights,"
5474,SCREAMING TARN,"And when the moon was clear and round,"
5475,SCREAMING TARN,Bubbles which to the surface swam
5476,SCREAMING TARN,And burst as if they held the sound.—
5477,SCREAMING TARN,
5478,SCREAMING TARN,’Twas in the days ere hapless Charles
5479,SCREAMING TARN,"Losing his crown had lost his head,"
5480,SCREAMING TARN,This tale is told of him who kept
5481,SCREAMING TARN,The inn upon the watershed:
5482,SCREAMING TARN,
5483,SCREAMING TARN,He was a lowbred ruin’d man
5484,SCREAMING TARN,Whom lawless times set free from fear:
5485,SCREAMING TARN,One evening to his house there rode
5486,SCREAMING TARN,A young and gentle cavalier.
5487,SCREAMING TARN,
5488,SCREAMING TARN,With curling hair and linen fair
5489,SCREAMING TARN,And jewel-hilted sword he went;
5490,SCREAMING TARN,"The horse he rode he had ridden far,"
5491,SCREAMING TARN,And he was with his journey spent.
5492,SCREAMING TARN,
5493,SCREAMING TARN,"He asked a lodging for the night,"
5494,SCREAMING TARN,"His valise from his steed unbound,"
5495,SCREAMING TARN,He let none bear it but himself
5496,SCREAMING TARN,And set it by him on the ground.
5497,SCREAMING TARN,
5498,SCREAMING TARN,"’Here’s gold or jewels,’ thought the host,"
5499,SCREAMING TARN,’That’s carrying south to find the king.’
5500,SCREAMING TARN,"He chattered many a loyal word,"
5501,SCREAMING TARN,And scraps of royal airs gan sing.
5502,SCREAMING TARN,
5503,SCREAMING TARN,His guest thereat grew more at ease
5504,SCREAMING TARN,"And o’er his wine he gave a toast,"
5505,SCREAMING TARN,"But little ate, and to his room"
5506,SCREAMING TARN,Carried his sack behind the host.
5507,SCREAMING TARN,
5508,SCREAMING TARN,"’Now rest you well,’ the host he said,"
5509,SCREAMING TARN,But of his wish the word fell wide;
5510,SCREAMING TARN,Nor did he now forget his son
5511,SCREAMING TARN,Who fell in fight by Cromwell’s side.
5512,SCREAMING TARN,
5513,SCREAMING TARN,Revenge and poverty have brought
5514,SCREAMING TARN,Full gentler heart than his to crime;
5515,SCREAMING TARN,"And he was one by nature rude,"
5516,SCREAMING TARN,Born to foul deeds at any time.
5517,SCREAMING TARN,
5518,SCREAMING TARN,With unshod feet at dead of night
5519,SCREAMING TARN,"In stealth he to the guest-room crept,"
5520,SCREAMING TARN,"Lantern and dagger in his hand,"
5521,SCREAMING TARN,And stabbed his victim while he slept.
5522,SCREAMING TARN,
5523,SCREAMING TARN,"But as he struck a scream there came,"
5524,SCREAMING TARN,A fearful scream so loud and shrill:
5525,SCREAMING TARN,"He whelm’d the face with pillows o’er,"
5526,SCREAMING TARN,And lean’d till all had long been still.
5527,SCREAMING TARN,
5528,SCREAMING TARN,Then to the face the flame he held
5529,SCREAMING TARN,To see there should no life remain:—
5530,SCREAMING TARN,When lo! his brutal heart was quell’d:
5531,SCREAMING TARN,’Twas a fair woman he had slain.
5532,SCREAMING TARN,
5533,SCREAMING TARN,"The tan upon her face was paint,"
5534,SCREAMING TARN,"The manly hair was torn away,"
5535,SCREAMING TARN,Soft was the breast that he had pierced;
5536,SCREAMING TARN,Beautiful in her death she lay.
5537,SCREAMING TARN,
5538,SCREAMING TARN,"His was no heart to faint at crime,"
5539,SCREAMING TARN,Tho’ half he wished the deed undone.
5540,SCREAMING TARN,He pulled the valise from the bed
5541,SCREAMING TARN,To find what booty he had won.
5542,SCREAMING TARN,
5543,SCREAMING TARN,"He cut the straps, and pushed within"
5544,SCREAMING TARN,His murderous fingers to their theft.
5545,SCREAMING TARN,"A deathly sweat came o’er his brow,"
5546,SCREAMING TARN,He had no sense nor meaning left.
5547,SCREAMING TARN,
5548,SCREAMING TARN,"He touched not gold, it was not cold,"
5549,SCREAMING TARN,"It was not hard, it felt like flesh."
5550,SCREAMING TARN,He drew out by the curling hair
5551,SCREAMING TARN,"A young man’s head, and murder’d fresh;"
5552,SCREAMING TARN,
5553,SCREAMING TARN,"A young man’s head, cut by the neck."
5554,SCREAMING TARN,"But what was dreader still to see,"
5555,SCREAMING TARN,"Her whom he had slain he saw again,"
5556,SCREAMING TARN,The twain were like as like can be.
5557,SCREAMING TARN,
5558,SCREAMING TARN,"Brother and sister if they were,"
5559,SCREAMING TARN,"Both in one shroud they now were wound,—"
5560,SCREAMING TARN,"Across his back and down the stair,"
5561,SCREAMING TARN,Out of the house without a sound.
5562,SCREAMING TARN,
5563,SCREAMING TARN,"He made his way unto the tarn,"
5564,SCREAMING TARN,The night was dark and still and dank;
5565,SCREAMING TARN,The ripple chuckling neath the boat
5566,SCREAMING TARN,Laughed as he drew it to the bank.
5567,SCREAMING TARN,
5568,SCREAMING TARN,Upon the bottom of the boat
5569,SCREAMING TARN,"He laid his burden flat and low,"
5570,SCREAMING TARN,And on them laid the square sandstones
5571,SCREAMING TARN,That round about the margin go.
5572,SCREAMING TARN,
5573,SCREAMING TARN,"Stone upon stone he weigh’d them down,"
5574,SCREAMING TARN,Until the boat would hold no more;
5575,SCREAMING TARN,The freeboard now was scarce an inch:
5576,SCREAMING TARN,He stripp’d his clothes and push’d from shore.
5577,SCREAMING TARN,
5578,SCREAMING TARN,All naked to the middle pool
5579,SCREAMING TARN,He swam behind in the dark night;
5580,SCREAMING TARN,And there he let the water in
5581,SCREAMING TARN,And sank his terror out of sight.
5582,SCREAMING TARN,
5583,SCREAMING TARN,"He swam ashore, and donn’d his dress,"
5584,SCREAMING TARN,And scraped his bloody fingers clean;
5585,SCREAMING TARN,Ran home and on his victim’s steed
5586,SCREAMING TARN,"Mounted, and never more was seen."
5587,SCREAMING TARN,
5588,SCREAMING TARN,But to a comrade ere he died
5589,SCREAMING TARN,He told his story guess’d of none:
5590,SCREAMING TARN,So from his lips the crime returned
5591,SCREAMING TARN,To haunt the spot where it was done.

5606,(FROM THE GREEK),Eur. And. 1250.
5607,(FROM THE GREEK),
5608,(FROM THE GREEK),
5609,(FROM THE GREEK),Voyaging northwards by the western strand
5610,(FROM THE GREEK),Of the Euxine sea we came to where the land
5611,(FROM THE GREEK),Sinks low in salt morass and wooded plain:
5612,(FROM THE GREEK),"Here mighty Ister pushes to the main,"
5613,(FROM THE GREEK),Forking his turbid flood in channels three
5614,(FROM THE GREEK),To plough the sands with which he chokes the sea.
5615,(FROM THE GREEK),
5616,(FROM THE GREEK),"Against his middle arm, not many a mile"
5617,(FROM THE GREEK),In the offing of black water is the isle
5618,(FROM THE GREEK),"Named of Achilles, or as Leukê known,"
5619,(FROM THE GREEK),"Which tender Thetis, counselling alone"
5620,(FROM THE GREEK),"With her wise sire beneath the ocean-wave,"
5621,(FROM THE GREEK),"Unto her child’s departed spirit gave,"
5622,(FROM THE GREEK),"Where he might still his love and fame enjoy,"
5623,(FROM THE GREEK),Through the vain Danaan cause fordone at Troy.
5624,(FROM THE GREEK),"Thither Achilles passed, and long fulfill’d"
5625,(FROM THE GREEK),"His earthly lot, as the high gods had will’d,"
5626,(FROM THE GREEK),"Far from the rivalries of men, from strife,"
5627,(FROM THE GREEK),"From arms, from woman’s love and toil of life."
5628,(FROM THE GREEK),Now of his lone abode I will unfold
5629,(FROM THE GREEK),"What there I saw, or was by others told."
5630,(FROM THE GREEK),
5631,(FROM THE GREEK),There is in truth a temple on the isle;
5632,(FROM THE GREEK),Therein a wooden statue of rude style
5633,(FROM THE GREEK),And workmanship antique with helm of lead:
5634,(FROM THE GREEK),"Else all is desert, uninhabited;"
5635,(FROM THE GREEK),"Only a few goats browse the wind-swept rocks,"
5636,(FROM THE GREEK),And oft the stragglers of their starving flocks
5637,(FROM THE GREEK),"Are caught and sacrificed by whomsoe’er,"
5638,(FROM THE GREEK),Whoever of chance or purpose hither fare:
5639,(FROM THE GREEK),About the fence lie strewn their bleaching bones.
5640,(FROM THE GREEK),
5641,(FROM THE GREEK),"But in the temple jewels and precious stones,"
5642,(FROM THE GREEK),"Upheapt with golden rings and vials lie,"
5643,(FROM THE GREEK),"Thankofferings to Achilles, and thereby,"
5644,(FROM THE GREEK),"Written or scratch’d upon the walls in view,"
5645,(FROM THE GREEK),"Inscriptions, with the givers’ names thereto,"
5646,(FROM THE GREEK),"Some in Romaic character, some Greek,"
5647,(FROM THE GREEK),As each man in the tongue that he might speak
5648,(FROM THE GREEK),"Wrote verse of praise, or prayer for good to come,"
5649,(FROM THE GREEK),"To Achilles most, but to Patroclus some;"
5650,(FROM THE GREEK),For those who strongly would Achilles move
5651,(FROM THE GREEK),Approach him by the pathway of his love.
5652,(FROM THE GREEK),
5653,(FROM THE GREEK),"Thousands of birds frequent the sheltering shrine,"
5654,(FROM THE GREEK),"The dippers and the swimmers of the brine,"
5655,(FROM THE GREEK),"Sea-mew and gull and diving cormorant,"
5656,(FROM THE GREEK),Fishers that on the high cliff make their haunt
5657,(FROM THE GREEK),"Sheer inaccessible, and sun themselves"
5658,(FROM THE GREEK),Huddled arow upon the narrow shelves:—
5659,(FROM THE GREEK),And surely no like wonder ere hath been
5660,(FROM THE GREEK),As that such birds should keep the temple clean;
5661,(FROM THE GREEK),But thus they do: at earliest dawn of day
5662,(FROM THE GREEK),"They flock to sea and in the waters play,"
5663,(FROM THE GREEK),"And when they well have wet their plumage light,"
5664,(FROM THE GREEK),Back to the sanctuary they take flight
5665,(FROM THE GREEK),"Splashing the walls and columns with fresh brine,"
5666,(FROM THE GREEK),"Till all the stone doth fairly drip and shine,"
5667,(FROM THE GREEK),When off again they skim asea for more
5668,(FROM THE GREEK),"And soon returning sprinkle steps and floor,"
5669,(FROM THE GREEK),And sweep all cleanly with their wide-spread wings.
5670,(FROM THE GREEK),
5671,(FROM THE GREEK),From other men I have learnt further things.
5672,(FROM THE GREEK),"If any of free purpose, thus they tell,"
5673,(FROM THE GREEK),"Sail’d hither to consult the oracle,—"
5674,(FROM THE GREEK),"For oracle there was,—they sacrificed"
5675,(FROM THE GREEK),"Such victims as they brought, if such sufficed,"
5676,(FROM THE GREEK),"And some they slew, some to the god set free:"
5677,(FROM THE GREEK),But they who driven from their course at sea
5678,(FROM THE GREEK),"Chanced on the isle, took of the goats thereon"
5679,(FROM THE GREEK),And pray’d Achilles to accept his own.
5680,(FROM THE GREEK),"Then made they a gift, and when they had offer’d once,"
5681,(FROM THE GREEK),"If to their question there was no response,"
5682,(FROM THE GREEK),They added to the gift and asked again;
5683,(FROM THE GREEK),"Yea twice and more, until the god should deign"
5684,(FROM THE GREEK),"Answer to give, their offering they renew’d;"
5685,(FROM THE GREEK),Whereby great riches to the shrine ensued.
5686,(FROM THE GREEK),And when both sacrifice and gifts were made
5687,(FROM THE GREEK),"They worship’d at the shrine, and as they pray’d"
5688,(FROM THE GREEK),Sailors aver that often hath been seen
5689,(FROM THE GREEK),"A man like to a god, of warrior mien,"
5690,(FROM THE GREEK),A beauteous form of figure swift and strong;
5691,(FROM THE GREEK),Down on his shoulders his light hair hung long
5692,(FROM THE GREEK),And his full armour was enchast with gold:
5693,(FROM THE GREEK),"While some, who with their eyes might nought behold,"
5694,(FROM THE GREEK),Say that with music strange the air was stir’d;
5695,(FROM THE GREEK),"And some there are, who have both seen and heard:"
5696,(FROM THE GREEK),"And if a man wish to be favour’d more,"
5697,(FROM THE GREEK),He need but spend one night upon the shore;
5698,(FROM THE GREEK),To him in sleep Achilles will appear
5699,(FROM THE GREEK),"And lead him to his tent, and with good cheer"
5700,(FROM THE GREEK),Show him all friendliness that men desire;
5701,(FROM THE GREEK),"Patroclus pours the wine, and he his lyre"
5702,(FROM THE GREEK),Takes from the pole and plays the strains thereon
5703,(FROM THE GREEK),Which Cheiron taught him first on Pelion.
5704,(FROM THE GREEK),
5705,(FROM THE GREEK),"These things I tell as they were told to me,"
5706,(FROM THE GREEK),Nor do I question but it well may be:
5707,(FROM THE GREEK),"For sure I am that, if man ever was,"
5708,(FROM THE GREEK),"Achilles was a hero, both because"
5709,(FROM THE GREEK),"Of his high birth and beauty, his country’s call,"
5710,(FROM THE GREEK),"His valour of soul, his early death withal,"
5711,(FROM THE GREEK),"For Homer’s praise, the crown of human art;"
5712,(FROM THE GREEK),And that above all praise he had at heart
5713,(FROM THE GREEK),"A gentler passion in her sovran sway,"
5714,(FROM THE GREEK),And when his love died threw his life away.

5803,NOTE,The poems contained in Book I are my final selection from a volume
5804,NOTE,published in 1873. Those of Book II are from a pamphlet published in
5805,NOTE,1879. Some of all these are in places corrected. Book III is made up of
5806,NOTE,poems from a pamphlet published in 1880; to which are added others of
5807,NOTE,about the same date. Some of these have already appeared in a volume
5808,NOTE,"printed for me by my friend the Rev. C. H. Daniel, in 1884. No. 6 was"
5809,NOTE,written to a tune by Dr. Howard. No. 19 is a pretty close translation
5810,NOTE,"of a poem by Théophile Gautier, which is itself a translation from"
5811,NOTE,the English by Thomas Moore in _The Epicurean_. All the poems in Book
5812,NOTE,IV are now printed for the first time. No. 9 is a translation from a
5813,NOTE,madrigal by Michael Angelo (No. VIII in _Guasti_). It is from my Comedy
5814,NOTE,"’The Humours of the Court,’ in which also No. 16 occurs. No. 11 is"
5815,NOTE,"from a Sicilian nona rima stanza, the first poem in Trucchi’s _Poesie"
5816,NOTE,Italiane inedite_. No. 3 is but the initial fragment of a poem which
5817,NOTE,took another shape.

5825,NOTE TO FOURTH EDITION,"contemporaneously with an American edition, according to the"
5826,NOTE TO FOURTH EDITION,requirements of the international copyright law. In passing the proofs
5827,NOTE TO FOURTH EDITION,of this edition I have altered the first line of No. 10: which being
5828,NOTE TO FOURTH EDITION,"actually descriptive of a robin’s song, now appears as such. It was"
5829,NOTE TO FOURTH EDITION,first printed ’Pink-throated linnet.’ I have also written ’and’ for
5830,NOTE TO FOURTH EDITION,"’or’ in two lines of V. 17, and amended I. 5."

5837,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,In revising my ’shorter poems’ for this edition I have corrected a
5838,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,few misprints which seem to have run through the earlier editions;
5839,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,"and, though I have refrained from the vanity of trying to improve old"
5840,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,"work which has been so often printed, I have amended one or two lines"
5841,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,which seemed peculiarly bad. I hope that the ’new poems’ which I have
5842,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,"gathered to fill this second volume up to the size of the first, may"
5843,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,be found in some respects better than the old. Eclogues 2 and 3 have
5844,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,"already appeared in the _Cornhill Magazine_, and the poems numbered"
5845,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,"severally 6, 14, 15 and 21, in Mr. Elkin Mathews’ _Shilling Garland_,"
5846,NOTE TO PRESENT VOLUME,No. II. 1896. The rest are printed here for the first time: they are of
