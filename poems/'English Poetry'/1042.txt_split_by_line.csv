104,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Midway between eve and dawn,"
105,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"See the chase, the rout, the flight"
106,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"In deep forest; oread, faun,"
107,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Goat-foot, antlers laid on neck;"
108,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Ravenous all the line for speed.
109,WITH THE HUNTRESS,See yon wavy sparkle beck
110,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Sign of the Virgin Lady's lead.
111,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Down her course a serpent star
112,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Coils and shatters at her heels;
113,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Peals the horn exulting, peals"
114,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Plaintive, is it near or far."
115,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Huntress, arrowy to pursue,"

118,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Over torrent, over fen,"
119,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"She and forest, where she skims"
120,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Feathery, darken and relume:"
121,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Those are her white-lightning limbs
122,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Cleaving loads of leafy gloom.
123,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Mountains hear her and call back,"
124,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Shrewd with night: a frosty wail
125,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Distant: her the emerald vale
126,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Folds, and wonders in her track."
127,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Now her retinue is lean,"
128,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Many rearward; streams the chase
129,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Eager forth of covert; seen
130,WITH THE HUNTRESS,One hot tide the rapturous race.
131,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Quiver-charged and crescent-crowned,"
132,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Up on a flash the lighted mound
133,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Leaps she, bow to shoulder, shaft"
134,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Strung to barb with archer's craft,"
135,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Legs like plaited lyre-chords, feet"
136,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Songs to see, past pitch of sweet."
137,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Fearful swiftness they outrun,"
138,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Shaggy wildness, grey or dun,"
139,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Challenge, charge of tusks elude:"
140,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Theirs the dance to tame the rude;
141,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Beast, and beast in manhood tame,"
142,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Follow we their silver flame.
143,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Pride of flesh from bondage free,"
144,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Reaping vigour of its waste,"
145,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Marks her servitors, and she"
146,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Sanctifies the unembraced.
147,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Nought of perilous she reeks;
148,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Valour clothes her open breast;
149,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Sweet beyond the thrill of sex;
150,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Hallowed by the sex confessed.
151,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Huntress arrowy to pursue,"
152,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Colder she than sunless dew,"
153,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"She, that breath of upper air;"
154,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Ay, but never lyrist sang,"
155,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Draught of Bacchus never sprang
156,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Blood the bliss of Gods to share,"

162,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Then is pause and chatter, cheer,"
163,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Laughter at some satyr lame,"
164,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Looks upon the fallen deer,"
165,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Measuring his noble crest;
166,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Here a favourite in her train,"
167,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Foremost mid her nymphs, caressed;"
168,WITH THE HUNTRESS,All applauded.  Shall she reign
169,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Worshipped?  O to be with her there!
170,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"She, that breath of nimble air,"
171,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Lifts the breast to giant power.
172,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Maid and man, and man and maid,"
173,WITH THE HUNTRESS,Who each other would devour
174,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Elsewhere, by the chase betrayed,"
175,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"There are comrades, led by her,"
176,WITH THE HUNTRESS,"Maid-preserver, man-maker."

181,WITH THE PERSUADER,
182,WITH THE PERSUADER,
183,WITH THE PERSUADER,"WHO murmurs, hither, hither: who"
184,WITH THE PERSUADER,Where nought is audible so fills the ear?
185,WITH THE PERSUADER,Where nought is visible can make appear
186,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A veil with eyes that waver through,"
187,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Like twilight's pledge of blessed night to come,"
188,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or day most golden?  All unseen and dumb,"
189,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She breathes, she moves, inviting flees,"
190,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Is lost, and leaves the thrilled desire"
191,WITH THE PERSUADER,"To clasp and strike a slackened lyre,"
192,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Till over smiles of hyacinth seas,"
193,WITH THE PERSUADER,Flame in a crystal vessel sails
194,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Beneath a dome of jewelled spray,"
195,WITH THE PERSUADER,For land that drops the rosy day
196,WITH THE PERSUADER,On nights of throbbing nightingales.
197,WITH THE PERSUADER,
198,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Landward did the wonder flit,"
199,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or heart's desire of her, all earth in it."
200,WITH THE PERSUADER,We saw the heavens fling down their rose;
201,WITH THE PERSUADER,On rapturous waves we saw her glide;
202,WITH THE PERSUADER,The pearly sea-shell half enclose;
203,WITH THE PERSUADER,The shoal of sea-nymphs flush the tide;
204,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And we, afire to kiss her feet, no more"
205,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Behold than tracks along a startled shore,"
206,WITH THE PERSUADER,With brightened edges of dark leaves that feign
207,WITH THE PERSUADER,"An ambush hoped, as heartless night remain."
208,WITH THE PERSUADER,
209,WITH THE PERSUADER,"More closely, warmly: hither, hither! she,"
210,WITH THE PERSUADER,The very she called forth by ripened blood
211,WITH THE PERSUADER,"For its next breath of being, murmurs; she,"
212,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Allurement; she, fulfilment; she,"
213,WITH THE PERSUADER,The stream within us urged to flood;
214,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Man's cry, earth's answer, heaven's consent; O she,"
215,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Maid, woman and divinity;"
216,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Our over-earthly, inner-earthly mate"
217,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Unmated; she, our hunger and our fruit"
218,WITH THE PERSUADER,Untasted; she our written fate
219,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Unread; Life's flowering, Life's root:"
220,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Unread, divined; unseen, beheld;"
221,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The evanescent, ever-present she,"
222,WITH THE PERSUADER,Great Nature's stern necessity
223,WITH THE PERSUADER,"In radiance clothed, to softness quelled;"
224,WITH THE PERSUADER,With a sword's edge of sweetness keen to take
225,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Our breath for bliss, our hearts for fulness break."
226,WITH THE PERSUADER,
227,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The murmur hushes down, the veil is rent."
228,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Man's cry, earth's answer, heaven's consent,"
229,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her form is given to pardoned sight,"
230,WITH THE PERSUADER,And lets our mortal eyes receive
231,WITH THE PERSUADER,The sovereign loveliness of celestial white;
232,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Adored by them who solitarily pace,"
233,WITH THE PERSUADER,"In dusk of the underworld's perpetual eve,"
234,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The paths among the meadow asphodel,"
235,WITH THE PERSUADER,Remembering.  Never there her face
236,WITH THE PERSUADER,Is planetary; reddens to shore sea-shell
237,WITH THE PERSUADER,Around such whiteness the enamoured air
238,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Of noon that clothes her, never there."
239,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Daughter of light, the joyful light,"
240,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She stands unveiled to nuptial sight,"
241,WITH THE PERSUADER,Sweet in her disregard of aid
242,WITH THE PERSUADER,Divine to conquer or persuade.
243,WITH THE PERSUADER,A fountain jets from moss; a flower
244,WITH THE PERSUADER,Bends gently where her sunset tresses shower.
245,WITH THE PERSUADER,By guerdon of her brilliance may be seen
246,WITH THE PERSUADER,With eyelids unabashed the passion's Queen.
247,WITH THE PERSUADER,
248,WITH THE PERSUADER,Shorn of attendant Graces she can use
249,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her natural snares to make her will supreme.
250,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A simple nymph it is, inclined to muse"
251,WITH THE PERSUADER,Before the leader foot shall dip in stream:
252,WITH THE PERSUADER,One arm at curve along a rounded thigh;
253,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her firm new breasts each pointing its own way
254,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A knee half bent to shade its fellow shy,"
255,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Where innocence, not nature, signals nay."
256,WITH THE PERSUADER,The bud of fresh virginity awaits
257,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The wooer, and all roseate will she burst:"
258,WITH THE PERSUADER,She touches on the hour of happy mates;
259,WITH THE PERSUADER,Still is she unaware she wakens thirst.
260,WITH THE PERSUADER,
261,WITH THE PERSUADER,And while commanding blissful sight believe
262,WITH THE PERSUADER,"It holds her as a body strained to breast,"
263,WITH THE PERSUADER,Down on the underworld's perpetual eve
264,WITH THE PERSUADER,She plunges the possessor dispossessed;
265,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And bids believe that image, heaving warm,"
266,WITH THE PERSUADER,Is lost to float like torch-smoke after flame;
267,WITH THE PERSUADER,The phantom any breeze blows out of form;
268,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A thirst's delusion, a defeated aim."
269,WITH THE PERSUADER,
270,WITH THE PERSUADER,The rapture shed the torture weaves;
271,WITH THE PERSUADER,The direst blow on human heart she deals:
272,WITH THE PERSUADER,The pain to know the seen deceives;
273,WITH THE PERSUADER,Nought true but what insufferably feels.
274,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And stabs of her delicious note,"
275,WITH THE PERSUADER,"That is as heavenly light to hearing, heard"
276,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Through shelter leaves, the laughter from her throat,"
277,WITH THE PERSUADER,We answer as the midnight's morning's bird.
278,WITH THE PERSUADER,
279,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She laughs, she wakens gleeful cries;"
280,WITH THE PERSUADER,In her delicious laughter part revealed;
281,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Yet mother is she more of moans and sighs,"
282,WITH THE PERSUADER,For longings unappeased and wounds unhealed.
283,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Yet would she bless, it is her task to bless:"
284,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Yon folded couples, passing under shade,"
285,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Are her rich harvest; bidden caress, caress,"
286,WITH THE PERSUADER,Consume the fruit in bloom; not disobeyed.
287,WITH THE PERSUADER,"We dolorous complainers had a dream,"
288,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Wrought on the vacant air from inner fire,"
289,WITH THE PERSUADER,We saw stand bare of her celestial beam
290,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The glorious Goddess, and we dared desire."
291,WITH THE PERSUADER,
292,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Thereat are shown reproachful eyes, and lips"
293,WITH THE PERSUADER,Of upward curl to meanings half obscure;
294,WITH THE PERSUADER,And glancing where a wood-nymph lightly skips
295,WITH THE PERSUADER,She nods: at once that creature wears her lure.
296,WITH THE PERSUADER,Blush of our being between birth and death:
297,WITH THE PERSUADER,Sob of our ripened blood for its next breath:
298,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her wily semblance nought of her denies;
299,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Seems it the Goddess runs, the Goddess hies,"
300,WITH THE PERSUADER,The generous Goddess yields.  And she can arm
301,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her dwarfed and twisted with her secret charm;
302,WITH THE PERSUADER,Benevolent as Earth to feed her own.
303,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Fully shall they be fed, if they beseech."
304,WITH THE PERSUADER,But scorn she has for them that walk alone;
305,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Blanched men, starved women, whom no arts can pleach."
306,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The men as chief of criminals she disdains,"
307,WITH THE PERSUADER,And holds the reason in perceptive thought.
308,WITH THE PERSUADER,"More pitiable, like rivers lacking rains,"
309,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Kissing cold stones, the women shrink for drought."
310,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Those faceless discords, out of nature strayed,"
311,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Rank of the putrefaction ere decayed,"
312,WITH THE PERSUADER,In impious singles bear the thorny wreaths:
313,WITH THE PERSUADER,Their lives are where harmonious Pleasure breathes
314,WITH THE PERSUADER,For couples crowned with flowers that burn in dew.
315,WITH THE PERSUADER,Comes there a tremor of night's forest horn
316,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Across her garden from the insaner crew,"
317,WITH THE PERSUADER,She darkens to malignity of scorn.
318,WITH THE PERSUADER,A shiver courses through her garden-grounds:
319,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Grunt of the tusky boar, the baying hounds,"
320,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The hunter's shouts, are heard afar, and bring"
321,WITH THE PERSUADER,Dead on her heart her crimsoned flower of Spring.
322,WITH THE PERSUADER,"These, the irreverent of Life's design,"
323,WITH THE PERSUADER,Division between natural and divine
324,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Would cast; these vaunting barrenness for best,"
325,WITH THE PERSUADER,In veins of gathered strength Life's tide arrest;
326,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And these because the roses flood their cheeks,"
327,WITH THE PERSUADER,Vow them in nature wise as when Love speaks.
328,WITH THE PERSUADER,With them is war; and well the Goddess knows
329,WITH THE PERSUADER,What undermines the race who mount the rose;
330,WITH THE PERSUADER,"How the ripe moment, lodged in slumberous hours,"
331,WITH THE PERSUADER,Enkindled by persuasion overpowers:
332,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Why weak as are her frailer trailing weeds,"
333,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The strong when Beauty gleams o'er Nature's needs,"
334,WITH THE PERSUADER,And timely guile unguarded finds them lie.
335,WITH THE PERSUADER,"They who her sway withstand a sea defy,"
336,WITH THE PERSUADER,At every point of juncture must be proof;
337,WITH THE PERSUADER,Nor look for mercy from the incessant surge
338,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her forces mixed of craft and passion urge
339,WITH THE PERSUADER,For the one whelming wave to spring aloof.
340,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She, tenderness, is pitiless to them"
341,WITH THE PERSUADER,Resisting in her godhead nature's truth.
342,WITH THE PERSUADER,"No flower their face shall be, but writhen stem;"
343,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Their youth a frost, their age the dirge for youth."
344,WITH THE PERSUADER,"These miserably disinclined,"
345,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The lamentably unembraced,"
346,WITH THE PERSUADER,Insult the Pleasures Earth designed
347,WITH THE PERSUADER,To people and beflower the waste.
348,WITH THE PERSUADER,Wherefore the Pleasures pass them by:
349,WITH THE PERSUADER,"For death they live, in life they die."
350,WITH THE PERSUADER,
351,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her head the Goddess from them turns,"
352,WITH THE PERSUADER,As from grey mounds of ashes in bronze urns.
353,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She views her quivering couples unconsoled,"
354,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And of her beauty mirror they become,"
355,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Like orchard blossoms, apple, pear and plum,"
356,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Free of the cloud, beneath the flood of gold."
357,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Crowned with wreaths that burn in dew,"
358,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her couples whirl, sun-satiated,"
359,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Athirst for shade, they sigh, they wed,"
360,WITH THE PERSUADER,They play the music made of two:
361,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Oldest of earth, earth's youngest till earth's end:"
362,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Cunninger than the numbered strings,"
363,WITH THE PERSUADER,"For melodies, for harmonies,"
364,WITH THE PERSUADER,"For mastered discords, and the things"
365,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Not vocable, whose mysteries"
366,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Are inmost Love's, Life's reach of Life extend."
367,WITH THE PERSUADER,
368,WITH THE PERSUADER,Is it an anguish overflowing shame
369,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And the tongue's pudency confides to her,"
370,WITH THE PERSUADER,"With eyes of embers, breath of incense myrrh,"
371,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The woman's marrow in some dear youth's name,"
372,WITH THE PERSUADER,Then is the Goddess tenderness
373,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Maternal, and she has a sister's tones"
374,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Benign to soothe intemperate distress,"
375,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Divide despair from hope, and sighs from moans."
376,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her gentleness imparts exhaling ease
377,WITH THE PERSUADER,To those of her milk-bearer votaries
378,WITH THE PERSUADER,As warm of bosom-earth as she; of the source
379,WITH THE PERSUADER,Direct; erratic but in heart's excess;
380,WITH THE PERSUADER,Being mortal and ill-matched for Love's great force;
381,WITH THE PERSUADER,Like green leaves caught with flames by his impress.
382,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And pray they under skies less overcast,"
383,WITH THE PERSUADER,"That swiftly may her star of eve descend,"
384,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her lustrous morning star fly not too fast,"
385,WITH THE PERSUADER,To lengthen blissful night will she befriend.
386,WITH THE PERSUADER,
387,WITH THE PERSUADER,Unfailing her reply to woman's voice
388,WITH THE PERSUADER,"In supplication instant.  Is it man's,"
389,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She hears, approves his words, her garden scans,"
390,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And him: the flowers are various, he has choice."
391,WITH THE PERSUADER,Perchance his wound is deep; she listens long;
392,WITH THE PERSUADER,Enjoys what music fills the plaintive song;
393,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And marks how he, who would be hawk at poise"
394,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Above the bird, his plaintive song enjoys."
395,WITH THE PERSUADER,
396,WITH THE PERSUADER,She reads him when his humbled manhood weeps
397,WITH THE PERSUADER,To her invoked: distraction is implored.
398,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A smile, and he is up on godlike leaps"
399,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Above, with his bright Goddess owned the adored."
400,WITH THE PERSUADER,His tales of her declare she condescends;
401,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Can share his fires, not always goads and rends:"
402,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Moreover, quits a throne, and must enclose"
403,WITH THE PERSUADER,A queenlier gem than woman's wayside rose.
404,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She bends, he quickens; she breathes low, he springs"
405,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Enraptured; low she laughs, his woes disperse;"
406,WITH THE PERSUADER,Aloud she laughs and sweeps his varied strings.
407,WITH THE PERSUADER,'Tis taught him how for touch of mournful verse
408,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Rarely the music made of two ascends,"
409,WITH THE PERSUADER,And Beauty's Queen some other way is won.
410,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or it may solve the riddle, that she lends"
411,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Herself to all, and yields herself to none,"
412,WITH THE PERSUADER,Save heavenliest: though claims by men are raised
413,WITH THE PERSUADER,In hot assurance under shade of doubt:
414,WITH THE PERSUADER,And numerous are the images bepraised
415,WITH THE PERSUADER,"As Beauty's Queen, should passion head the rout."
416,WITH THE PERSUADER,
417,WITH THE PERSUADER,Be sure the ruddy hue is Love's: to woo
418,WITH THE PERSUADER,Love's Fountain we must mount the ruddy hue.
419,WITH THE PERSUADER,"That is her garden's precept, seen where shines"
420,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her blood-flower, and its unsought neighbour pines."
421,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Daughter of light, the joyful light,"
422,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She bids her couples face full East,"
423,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Reflecting radiance, even when from her feast"
424,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Their outstretched arms brown deserts disunite,"
425,WITH THE PERSUADER,The lion-haunted thickets hold apart.
426,WITH THE PERSUADER,In love the ruddy hue declares great heart;
427,WITH THE PERSUADER,High confidence in her whose aid is lent
428,WITH THE PERSUADER,"To lovers lifting the tuned instrument,"
429,WITH THE PERSUADER,Not one of rippled strings and funeral tone.
430,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And doth the man pursue a tightened zone,"
431,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Then be it as the Laurel God he runs,"
432,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Confirmed to win, with countenance the Sun's."
433,WITH THE PERSUADER,
434,WITH THE PERSUADER,Should pity bless the tremulous voice of woe
435,WITH THE PERSUADER,"He lifts for pity, limp his offspring show."
436,WITH THE PERSUADER,For him requiring woman's arts to please
437,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Infantile tastes with babe reluctances,"
438,WITH THE PERSUADER,No race of giants!  In the woman's veins
439,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Persuasion ripely runs, through hers the pains."
440,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Her choice of him, should kind occasion nod,"
441,WITH THE PERSUADER,Aspiring blends the Titan with the God;
442,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Yet unto dwarf and mortal, she, submiss"
443,WITH THE PERSUADER,"In her high Lady's mandate, yields the kiss;"
444,WITH THE PERSUADER,And is it needed that Love's daintier brute
445,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Be snared as hunter, she will tempt pursuit."
446,WITH THE PERSUADER,She is great Nature's ever intimate
447,WITH THE PERSUADER,"In breast, and doth as ready handmaid wait,"
448,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Until perverted by her senseless male,"
449,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She plays the winding snake, the shrinking snail,"
450,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The flying deer, all tricks of evil fame,"
451,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Elusive to allure, since he grew tame."
452,WITH THE PERSUADER,
453,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Hence has the Goddess, Nature's earliest Power,"
454,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And greatest and most present, with her dower"
455,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Of the transcendent beauty, gained repute"
456,WITH THE PERSUADER,For meditated guile.  She laughs to hear
457,WITH THE PERSUADER,"A charge her garden's labyrinths scarce confute,"
458,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her garden's histories tell of to all near.
459,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Let it be said, But less upon her guile"
460,WITH THE PERSUADER,Doth she rely for her immortal smile.
461,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Still let the rumour spread, and terror screens"
462,WITH THE PERSUADER,To push her conquests by the simplest means.
463,WITH THE PERSUADER,"While man abjures not lustihead, nor swerves"
464,WITH THE PERSUADER,"From earth's good labours, Beauty's Queen he serves."
465,WITH THE PERSUADER,
466,WITH THE PERSUADER,Her spacious garden and her garden's grant
467,WITH THE PERSUADER,She offers in reward for handsome cheer:
468,WITH THE PERSUADER,Choice of the nymphs whose looks will slant
469,WITH THE PERSUADER,The secret down a dewy leer
470,WITH THE PERSUADER,Of corner eyelids into haze:
471,WITH THE PERSUADER,Many a fair Aphrosyne
472,WITH THE PERSUADER,Like flower-bell to honey-bee:
473,WITH THE PERSUADER,And here they flicker round the maze
474,WITH THE PERSUADER,Bewildering him in heart and head:
475,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And here they wear the close demure,"
476,WITH THE PERSUADER,With subtle peeps to reassure:
477,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Others parade where love has bled,"
478,WITH THE PERSUADER,And of its crimson weave their mesh:
479,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Others to snap of fingers leap,"
480,WITH THE PERSUADER,As bearing breast with love asleep.
481,WITH THE PERSUADER,These are her laughters in the flesh.
482,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or would she fit a warrior mood,"
483,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She lights her seeming unsubdued,"
484,WITH THE PERSUADER,And indicates the fortress-key.
485,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or is it heart for heart that craves,"
486,WITH THE PERSUADER,She flecks along a run of waves
487,WITH THE PERSUADER,The one to promise deeper sea.
488,WITH THE PERSUADER,
489,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Bands of her limpid primitives,"
490,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Or patterned in the curious braid,"
491,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Are the blest man's; and whatsoever he gives,"
492,WITH THE PERSUADER,For what he gives is he repaid.
493,WITH THE PERSUADER,Good is it if by him 'tis held
494,WITH THE PERSUADER,He wins the fairest ever welled
495,WITH THE PERSUADER,From Nature's founts: she whispers it: Even I
496,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Not fairer! and forbids him to deny,"
497,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Else little is he lover.  Those he clasps,"
498,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Intent as tempest, worshipful as prayer,--"
499,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And be they doves or be they asps,--"
500,WITH THE PERSUADER,Must seem to him the sovereignty fair;
501,WITH THE PERSUADER,Else counts he soon among life's wholly tamed.
502,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Him whom from utter savage she reclaimed,"
503,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Half savage must he stay, would he be crowned"
504,WITH THE PERSUADER,"The lover.  Else, past ripeness, deathward bound,"
505,WITH THE PERSUADER,"He reasons; and the totterer Earth detests,"
506,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Love shuns, grim logic screws in grasp, is he."
507,WITH THE PERSUADER,Doth man divide divine Necessity
508,WITH THE PERSUADER,"From Joy, between the Queen of Beauty's breasts"
509,WITH THE PERSUADER,A sword is driven; for those most glorious twain
510,WITH THE PERSUADER,Present her; armed to bless and to constrain.
511,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Of this he perishes; not she, the throned"
512,WITH THE PERSUADER,On rocks that spout their springs to the sacred mounts.
513,WITH THE PERSUADER,A loftier Reason out of deeper founts
514,WITH THE PERSUADER,Earth's chosen Goddess bears: by none disowned
515,WITH THE PERSUADER,"While red blood runs to swell the pulse, she boasts,"
516,WITH THE PERSUADER,"And Beauty, like her star, descends the sky;"
517,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Earth's answer, heaven's consent unto man's cry,"
518,WITH THE PERSUADER,Uplifted by the innumerable hosts.
519,WITH THE PERSUADER,
520,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Quickened of Nature's eye and ear,"
521,WITH THE PERSUADER,When the wild sap at high tide smites
522,WITH THE PERSUADER,Within us; or benignly clear
523,WITH THE PERSUADER,To vision; or as the iris lights
524,WITH THE PERSUADER,On fluctuant waters; she is ours
525,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Till set of man: the dreamed, the seen;"
526,WITH THE PERSUADER,Flushing the world with odorous flowers:
527,WITH THE PERSUADER,A soft compulsion on terrene
528,WITH THE PERSUADER,By heavenly: and the world is hers
529,WITH THE PERSUADER,While hunger after Beauty spurs.
530,WITH THE PERSUADER,
531,WITH THE PERSUADER,So is it sung in any space
532,WITH THE PERSUADER,"She fills, with laugh at shallow laws"
533,WITH THE PERSUADER,"Forbidding love's devised embrace,"
534,WITH THE PERSUADER,The music Beauty from it draws.
535,WITH THE PERSUADER,
536,WITH THE PERSUADER,
537,WITH THE PERSUADER,
538,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,THE TEST OF MANHOOD
539,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
540,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
541,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"LIKE a flood river whirled at rocky banks,"
542,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"An army issues out of wilderness,"
543,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,With battle plucking round its ragged flanks;
544,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Obstruction in the van; insane excess
545,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Oft at the heart; yet hard the onward stress
546,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Unto more spacious, where move ordered ranks,"
547,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And rise hushed temples built of shapely stone,"
548,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The work of hands not pledged to grind or slay.
549,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,They gave our earth a dress of flesh on bone;
550,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,A tongue to speak with answering heaven gave they.
551,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Then was the gracious birth of man's new day;
552,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Divided from the haunted night it shone.
553,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
554,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,That quiet dawn was Reverence; whereof sprang
555,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Ethereal Beauty in full morningtide.
556,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Another sun had risen to clasp his bride:
557,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,It was another earth unto him sang.
558,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
559,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Came Reverence from the Huntress on her heights?
560,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"From the Persuader came it, in those vales"
561,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Whereunto she melodiously invites,"
562,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Her troops of eager servitors regales?
563,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Not far those two great Powers of Nature speed
564,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Disciple steps on earth when sole they lead;
565,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Nor either points for us the way of flame.
566,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,From him predestined mightier it came;
567,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His task to hold them both in breast, and yield"
568,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Their dues to each, and of their war be field."
569,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
570,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The foes that in repulsion never ceased,"
571,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Must he, who once has been the goodly beast"
572,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Of one or other, at whose beck he ran,"
573,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Constrain to make him serviceable man;
574,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Offending neither, nor the natural claim"
575,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Each pressed, denying, for his true man's name."
576,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
577,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Ah, what a sweat of anguish in that strife"
578,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To hold them fast conjoined within him still;
579,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Submissive to his will
580,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Along the road of life!
581,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And marvel not he wavered if at whiles
582,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The forward step met frowns, the backward smiles."
583,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,For Pleasure witched him her sweet cup to drain;
584,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Repentance offered ecstasy in pain.
585,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Delicious licence called it Nature's cry;
586,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Ascetic rigours crushed the fleshly sigh;
587,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,A tread on shingle timed his lame advance
588,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Flung as the die of Bacchanalian Chance,"
589,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,He of the troubled marching army leaned
590,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"On godhead visible, on godhead screened;"
591,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The radiant roseate, the curtained white;"
592,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Yet sharp his battle strained through day, through night."
593,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
594,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He drank of fictions, till celestial aid"
595,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Might seem accorded when he fawned and prayed;
596,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Sagely the generous Giver circumspect,"
597,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To choose for grants the egregious, his elect;"
598,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And ever that imagined succour slew
599,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The soul of brotherhood whence Reverence drew.
600,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
601,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,In fellowship religion has its founts:
602,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The solitary his own God reveres:
603,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Ascend no sacred Mounts
604,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Our hungers or our fears.
605,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,As only for the numbers Nature's care
606,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Is shown, and she the personal nothing heeds,"
607,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,So to Divinity the spring of prayer
608,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,From brotherhood the one way upward leads.
609,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Like the sustaining air
610,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Are both for flowers and weeds.
611,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But he who claims in spirit to be flower,"
612,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Will find them both an air that doth devour.
613,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
614,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Whereby he smelt his treason, who implored"
615,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,External gifts bestowed but on the sword;
616,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Beheld himself, with less and less disguise,"
617,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Through those blood-cataracts which dimmed his eyes,"
618,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His army's foe, condemned to strive and fail;"
619,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,See a black adversary's ghost prevail;
620,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Never, though triumphs hailed him, hope to win"
621,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,While still the conflict tore his breast within.
622,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
623,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Out of that agony, misread for those"
624,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Imprisoned Powers warring unappeased,"
625,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The ghost of his black adversary rose,"
626,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To smother light, shut heaven, show earth diseased."
627,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And long with him was wrestling ere emerged
628,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,A mind to read in him the reflex shade
629,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Of its fierce torment; this way, that way urged;"
630,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,By craven compromises hourly swayed.
631,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
632,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Crouched as a nestling, still its wings untried,"
633,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The man's mind opened under weight of cloud.
634,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To penetrate the dark was it endowed;
635,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Stood day before a vision shooting wide.
636,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Whereat the spectral enemy lost form;
637,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The traversed wilderness exposed its track.
638,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,He felt the far advance in looking back;
639,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Thence trust in his foot forward through the storm.
640,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
641,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Under the low-browed tempest's eye of ire,"
642,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"That ere it lightened smote a coward heart,"
643,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Earth nerved her chastened son to hail athwart
644,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,All ventures perilous his shrouded Sire;
645,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"A stranger still, religiously divined;"
646,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Not yet with understanding read aright.
647,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But when the mind, the cherishable mind,"
648,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The multitude's grave shepherd, took full flight,"
649,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Himself as mirror raised among his kind,"
650,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He saw, and first of brotherhood had sight:"
651,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Knew that his force to fly, his will to see,"
652,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His heart enlarged beyond its ribbed domain,"
653,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Had come of many a grip in mastery,"
654,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Which held conjoined the hostile rival twain,"
655,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And of his bosom made him lord, to keep"
656,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The starry roof of his unruffled frame
657,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Awake to earth, to heaven, and plumb the deep"
658,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Below, above, aye with a wistful aim."
659,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
660,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The mastering mind in him, by tempests blown,"
661,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"By traitor inmates baited, upward burned;"
662,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Perforce of growth, the Master mind discerned,"
663,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The Great Unseen, nowise the Dark Unknown."
664,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To whom unwittingly did he aspire
665,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"In wilderness, where bitter was his need:"
666,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To whom in blindness, as an earthy seed"
667,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"For light and air, he struck through crimson mire."
668,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But not ere he upheld a forehead lamp,"
669,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And viewed an army, once the seeming doomed,"
670,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"All choral in its fruitful garden camp,"
671,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The spiritual the palpable illumed.
672,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
673,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"This gift of penetration and embrace,"
674,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His prize from tidal battles lost or won,"
675,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Reveals the scheme to animate his race:
676,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,How that it is a warfare but begun;
677,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Unending; with no Power to interpose;
678,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"No prayer, save for strength to keep his ground,"
679,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Heard of the Highest; never battle's close,"
680,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The victory complete and victor crowned:
681,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Nor solace in defeat, save from that sense"
682,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Of strength well spent, which is the strength renewed."
683,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,In manhood must he find his competence;
684,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,In his clear mind the spiritual food:
685,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,God being there while he his fight maintains;
686,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Throughout his mind the Master Mind being there,"
687,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,While he rejects the suicide despair;
688,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Accepts the spur of explicable pains;
689,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Obedient to Nature, not her slave:"
690,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Her lord, if to her rigid laws he bows;"
691,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Her dust, if with his conscience he plays knave,"
692,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And bids the Passions on the Pleasures browse:--
693,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Whence Evil in a world unread before;
694,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,That mystery to simple springs resolved.
695,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His God the Known, diviner to adore,"
696,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Shows Nature's savage riddles kindly solved.
697,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Inconscient, insensitive, she reigns"
698,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"In iron laws, though rapturous fair her face."
699,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Back to the primal brute shall he retrace
700,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His path, doth he permit to force her chains"
701,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"A soft Persuader coursing through his veins,"
702,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,An icy Huntress stringing to the chase:
703,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,What one the flash disdains;
704,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,What one so gives it grace.
705,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
706,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But is he rightly manful in her eyes,"
707,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"A splendid bloodless knight to gain the skies,"
708,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"A blood-hot son of Earth by all her signs,"
709,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Desireing and desireable he shines;
710,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"As peaches, that have caught the sun's uprise"
711,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And kissed warm gold till noonday, even as vines."
712,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Earth fills him with her juices, without fear"
713,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,That she will cast him drunken down the steeps.
714,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,All woman is she to this man most dear;
715,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He sows for bread, and she in spirit reaps:"
716,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"She conscient, she sensitive, in him;"
717,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"With him enwound, his brave ambition hers:"
718,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,By him humaner made; by his keen spurs
719,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Pricked to race past the pride in giant limb,"
720,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Her crazy adoration of big thews,"
721,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Proud in her primal sons, when crags they hurled,"
722,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Were thunder spitting lightnings on the world
723,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"In daily deeds, and she their evening Muse."
724,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
725,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"This man, this hero, works not to destroy;"
726,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,This godlike--as the rock in ocean stands;--
727,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He of the myriad eyes, the myriad hands"
728,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Creative; in his edifice has joy.
729,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,How strength may serve for purity is shown
730,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,When he himself can scourge to make it clean.
731,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Withal his pitch of pride would not disown
732,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,A sober world that walks the balanced mean
733,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Between its tempters, rarely overthrown:"
734,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,And such at times his army's march has been.
735,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
736,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Near is he to great Nature in the thought
737,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Each changing Season intimately saith,"
738,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,That nought save apparition knows the death;
739,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To the God-lighted mind of man 'tis nought.
740,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,She counts not loss a word of any weight;
741,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,It may befal his passions and his greeds
742,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To lose their treasures, like the vein that bleeds,"
743,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,But life gone breathless will she reinstate.
744,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
745,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Close on the heart of Earth his bosom beats,"
746,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"When he the mandate lodged in it obeys,"
747,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Alive to breast a future wrapped in haze,"
748,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Strike camp, and onward, like the wind's cloud-fleets."
749,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Unresting she, unresting he, from change"
750,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To change, as rain of cloud, as fruit of rain;"
751,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"She feels her blood-tree throbbing in her grain,"
752,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Yet skyward branched, with loftier mark and range."
753,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
754,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"No miracle the sprout of wheat from clod,"
755,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"She knows, nor growth of man in grisly brute;"
756,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"But he, the flower at head and soil at root,"
757,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Is miracle, guides he the brute to God."
758,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And that way seems he bound; that way the road,"
759,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"With his dark-lantern mind, unled, alone,"
760,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Wearifully through forest-tracts unsown,"
761,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He travels, urged by some internal goad."
762,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
763,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Dares he behold the thing he is, what thing"
764,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,He would become is in his mind its child;
765,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Astir, demanding birth to light and wing;"
766,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"For battle prompt, by pleasure unbeguiled."
767,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"So moves he forth in faith, if he has made"
768,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His mind God's temple, dedicate to truth."
769,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Earth's nourishing delights, no more gainsaid,"
770,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"He tastes, as doth the bridegroom rich in youth."
771,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Then knows he Love, that beckons and controls;"
772,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The star of sky upon his footway cast;
773,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Then match in him who holds his tempters fast,"
774,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"The body's love and mind's, whereof the soul's."
775,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Then Earth her man for woman finds at last,"
776,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,To speed the pair unto her goal of goals.
777,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
778,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Or is't the widowed's dream of her new mate?
779,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Seen has she virulent days of heat in flood;
780,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,The sly Persuader snaky in his blood;
781,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,With her the barren Huntress alternate;
782,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,His rough refractory off on kicking heels
783,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"To rear; the man dragged rearward, shamed, amazed;"
784,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And as a torrent stream where cattle grazed,"
785,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"His tumbled world.  What, then, the faith she feels?"
786,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"May not his aspect, like her own so fair"
787,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Reflexively, the central force belie,"
788,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"And he, the once wild ocean storming sky,"
789,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Be rebel at the core?  What hope is there?
790,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,
791,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"'Tis that in each recovery he preserves,"
792,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Between his upper and his nether wit,"
793,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Sense of his march ahead, more brightly lit;"
794,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,He less the shaken thing of lusts and nerves;
795,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,With such a grasp upon his brute as tells
796,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,Of wisdom from that vile relapsing spun.
797,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"A Sun goes down in wasted fire, a Sun"
798,THE TEST OF MANHOOD,"Resplendent springs, to faith refreshed compels."

807,THE CAGEING OF ARES,
808,THE CAGEING OF ARES,[_Dedicated to the Council at The Hague_.]
809,THE CAGEING OF ARES,
810,THE CAGEING OF ARES,HOW big of breast our Mother Gaea laughed
811,THE CAGEING OF ARES,At sight of her boy Giants on the leap
812,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Each over other as they neighboured home,"
813,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Fronting the day's descent across green slopes,"
814,THE CAGEING OF ARES,And up fired mountain crags their shadows danced.
815,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Close with them in their fun, she scarce could guess,"
816,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Though these two billowy urchins reeked of craft,"
817,THE CAGEING OF ARES,It signalled some adventurous master-trick
818,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"To set Olympians buzzing in debate,"
819,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Lest it might be their godhead undermined,"
820,THE CAGEING OF ARES,The Tyranny menaced.  Ephialtes high
821,THE CAGEING OF ARES,On shoulders of his brother Otos waved
822,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"For the bull-bellowings given to grand good news,"
823,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Compact, complexioned in his gleeful roar"
824,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"While Otos aped the prisoner's wrists and knees,"
825,THE CAGEING OF ARES,With doleful sniffs between recurrent howls;
826,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Till Gaea's lap receiving them, they stretched,"
827,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"And both upon her bosom shaken to speech,"
828,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Burst the hot story out of throats of both,"
829,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Like rocky head-founts, baffling in their glut"
830,THE CAGEING OF ARES,The hurried spout.  And as when drifting storm
831,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Disburdened loses clasp of here and yon
832,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"A peak, a forest mound, a valley's gleam"
833,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Of grass and the river's crooks and snaky coils,"
834,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Signification marvellous she caught,"
835,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Through gurglings of triumphant jollity,"
836,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Which now engulphed and now gave eye; at last
837,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Subsided, and the serious naked deed,"
838,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"With mountain-cloud of laughter banked around,"
839,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Stood in her sight confirmed: she could believe
840,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"That these, her sprouts of promise, her most prized,"
841,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"These two made up of lion, bear and fox,"
842,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Her sportive, suckling mammoths, her young joy,"
843,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Still by the reckoning infants among men,"
844,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Had done the deed to strike the Titan host
845,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"In envy dumb, in envious heart elate:"
846,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"These two combining strength and craft had snared,"
847,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Enmeshed, bound fast with thongs, discreetly caged"
848,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"The blood-shedder, the terrible Lord of War;"
849,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Destroyer, ravager, superb in plumes;"
850,THE CAGEING OF ARES,The barren furrower of anointed fields;
851,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"The scarlet heel in towns, foul smoke to sky,"
852,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Her hated enemy, too long her scourge:"
853,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Great Ares.  And they gagged his trumpet mouth
854,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"When they had seized on his implacable spear,"
855,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Hugged him to reedy helplessness despite
856,THE CAGEING OF ARES,His godlike fury startled from amaze.
857,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"For he had eyed them nearing him in play,"
858,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"The giant cubs, who gambolled and who snarled,"
859,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Unheeding his fell presence, by the mount"
860,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Ossa, beside a brushwood cavern; there"
861,THE CAGEING OF ARES,On Earth's original fisticuffs they called
862,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"For ease of sharp dispute: whereat the God,"
863,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Approving, deemed that sometime trained to arms,"
864,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Good servitors of Ares they would be,"
865,THE CAGEING OF ARES,And ply the pointed spear to dominate
866,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Their rebel restless fellows, villain brood"
867,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Vowed to defy Immortals.  So it chanced
868,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Amusedly he watched them, and as one"
869,THE CAGEING OF ARES,The lusty twain were on him and they had him.
870,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Breath to us, Powers of air, for laughter loud!"
871,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Cock of Olympus he, superb in plumes!"
872,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Bound like a wheaten sheaf by those two babes!
873,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Because they knew our Mother Gaea loathed him,"
874,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Knew him the famine, pestilence and waste;"
875,THE CAGEING OF ARES,A desolating fire to blind the sight
876,THE CAGEING OF ARES,With splendour built of fruitful things in ashes;
877,THE CAGEING OF ARES,The gory chariot-wheel on cries for justice;
878,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Her deepest planted and her liveliest voice,"
879,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Heard from the babe as from the broken crone.
880,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Behold him in his vessel of bronze encased,"
881,THE CAGEING OF ARES,And tumbled down the cave.  But rather look--
882,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Ah, that the woman tattler had not sought,"
883,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Of all the Gods to let her secret fly,"
884,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Hermes, after the thirteen songful months!"
885,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Prompting the Dexterous to work his arts,"
886,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"And shatter earth's delirious holiday,"
887,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Then first, as where the fountain runs a stream,"
888,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Resolving to composure on its throbs.
889,THE CAGEING OF ARES,But see her in the Seasons through that year;
890,THE CAGEING OF ARES,That one glad year and the fair opening month.
891,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Had never our Great Mother such sweet face!
892,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"War with her, gentle war with her, each day"
893,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Her sons and daughters urged; at eve were flung,"
894,THE CAGEING OF ARES,On the morrow stood to challenge; in their strength
895,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Renewed, indomitable; whereof they won,"
896,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"From hourly wrestlings up to shut of lids,"
897,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Her ready secret: the abounding life
898,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Returned for valiant labour: she and they
899,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Defeated and victorious turn by turn;
900,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"By loss enriched, by overthrow restored."
901,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Exchange of powers of this conflict came;
902,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Defacement none, nor ever squandered force."
903,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Is battle nature's mandate, here it reigned,"
904,THE CAGEING OF ARES,As music unto the hand that smote the strings;
905,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"And she the rosier from their showery brows,"
906,THE CAGEING OF ARES,They fruitful from her ploughed and harrowed breast.
907,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Back to the primal rational of those
908,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Who suck the teats of milky earth, and clasp"
909,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Stability in hatred of the insane,"
910,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Man stepped; with wits less fearful to pronounce
911,THE CAGEING OF ARES,The mortal mind's concept of earth's divorced
912,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Above; those beautiful, those masterful,"
913,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Those lawless.  High they sit, and if descend,"
914,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Descend to reap, not sowing.  Is it just?"
915,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Earth in her happy children asked that word,"
916,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Whereto within their breast was her reply.
917,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Those beautiful, those masterful, those lawless,"
918,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Enjoy the life prolonged, outleap the years;"
919,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Yet they ('twas the Great Mother's voice inspired
920,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"The audacious thought), they, glorious over dust,"
921,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Outleap not her; disrooted from her soar,"
922,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"To meet the certain fate of earth's divorced,"
923,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"And clap lame wings across a wintry haze,"
924,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Up to the farthest bourne: immortal still,"
925,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Thenceforth innocuous; lovelier than when ruled
926,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"The Tyranny.  This her voice within them told,"
927,THE CAGEING OF ARES,When softly the Great Mother chid her sons
928,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Not of the giant brood, who did create"
929,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Those lawless Gods, first offspring of our brain"
930,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Set moving by an abject blood, that waked"
931,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"To wanton under elements more benign,"
932,THE CAGEING OF ARES,And planted aliens on Olympian heights;--
933,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Imagination's cradle poesy
934,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Become a monstrous pressure upon men;--
935,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Foes of good Gaea; until dispossessed
936,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"By light from her, born of the love of her,"
937,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Their lordship the illumined brain rejects
938,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"For earth's beneficent, the sons of Law,"
939,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Her other name.  So spake she in their heart,"
940,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Among the wheat-blades proud of stalk; beneath
941,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Young vine-leaves pushing timid fingers forth,"
942,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Confidently to cling.  And when brown corn
943,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Swayed armied ranks with softened cricket song,"
944,THE CAGEING OF ARES,With gold necks bent for any zephyr's kiss;
945,THE CAGEING OF ARES,When vine-roots daily down a rubble soil
946,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Drank fire of heaven athirst to swell the grape;
947,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"When swelled the grape, and in it held a ray,"
948,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Rich issue of the embrace of heaven and earth;
949,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"The very eye of passion drowsed by excess,"
950,THE CAGEING OF ARES,And yet a burning lion for the spring;
951,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Then in that time of general cherishment,"
952,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Sweet breathing balm and flutes by cool wood-side,"
953,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"He the harsh rouser of ire being absent, caged,"
954,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Then did good Gaea's children gratefully
955,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Lift hymns to Gods they judged, but praised for peace,"
956,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Delightful Peace, that answers Reason's call"
957,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Harmoniously and images her Law;
958,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"Reflects, and though short-lived as then, revives,"
959,THE CAGEING OF ARES,In memories made present on the brain
960,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"By natural yearnings, all the happy scenes;"
961,THE CAGEING OF ARES,The picture of an earth allied to heaven;
962,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Between them the known smile behind black masks;
963,THE CAGEING OF ARES,Rightly their various moods interpreted;
964,THE CAGEING OF ARES,And frolic because toilful children borne
965,THE CAGEING OF ARES,With larger comprehension of Earth's aim
966,THE CAGEING OF ARES,"At loftier, clearer, sweeter, by their aid."

973,THE NIGHT-WALK,
974,THE NIGHT-WALK,AWAKES for me and leaps from shroud
975,THE NIGHT-WALK,All radiantly the moon's own night
976,THE NIGHT-WALK,Of folded showers in streamer cloud;
977,THE NIGHT-WALK,Our shadows down the highway white
978,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Or deep in woodland woven-boughed,"
979,THE NIGHT-WALK,With yon and yon a stem alight.
980,THE NIGHT-WALK,
981,THE NIGHT-WALK,I see marauder runagates
982,THE NIGHT-WALK,Across us shoot their dusky wink;
983,THE NIGHT-WALK,I hear the parliament of chats
984,THE NIGHT-WALK,In haws beside the river's brink;
985,THE NIGHT-WALK,"And drops the vole off alder-banks,"
986,THE NIGHT-WALK,To push his arrow through the stream.
987,THE NIGHT-WALK,These busy people had our thanks
988,THE NIGHT-WALK,"For tickling sight and sound, but theme"
989,THE NIGHT-WALK,They were not more than breath we drew
990,THE NIGHT-WALK,Delighted with our world's embrace:
991,THE NIGHT-WALK,"The moss-root smell where beeches grew,"
992,THE NIGHT-WALK,And watered grass in breezy space;
993,THE NIGHT-WALK,"The silken heights, of ghostly bloom"
994,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Among their folds, by distance draped."
995,THE NIGHT-WALK,"'Twas Youth, rapacious to consume,"
996,THE NIGHT-WALK,That cried to have its chaos shaped:
997,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Absorbing, little noting, still"
998,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Enriched, and thinking it bestowed;"
999,THE NIGHT-WALK,With wistful looks on each far hill
1000,THE NIGHT-WALK,"For something hidden, something owed."
1001,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Unto his mantled sister, Day"
1002,THE NIGHT-WALK,Had given the secret things we sought
1003,THE NIGHT-WALK,And she was grave and saintly gay;
1004,THE NIGHT-WALK,"At times she fluttered, spoke her thought;"
1005,THE NIGHT-WALK,"She flew on it, then folded wings,"
1006,THE NIGHT-WALK,"In meditation passing lone,"
1007,THE NIGHT-WALK,"To breathe around the secret things,"
1008,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Which have no word, and yet are known;"
1009,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Of thirst for them are known, as air"
1010,THE NIGHT-WALK,Is health in blood: we gained enough
1011,THE NIGHT-WALK,By this to feel it honest fare;
1012,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Impalpable, not barren, stuff."
1013,THE NIGHT-WALK,
1014,THE NIGHT-WALK,A pride of legs in motion kept
1015,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Our spirits to their task meanwhile,"
1016,THE NIGHT-WALK,And what was deepest dreaming slept:
1017,THE NIGHT-WALK,The posts that named the swallowed mile;
1018,THE NIGHT-WALK,Beside the straight canal the hut
1019,THE NIGHT-WALK,Abandoned; near the river's source
1020,THE NIGHT-WALK,Its infant chirp; the shortest cut;
1021,THE NIGHT-WALK,The roadway missed; were our discourse;
1022,THE NIGHT-WALK,"At times dear poets, whom some view"
1023,THE NIGHT-WALK,Transcendent or subdued evoked
1024,THE NIGHT-WALK,"To speak the memorable, the true,"
1025,THE NIGHT-WALK,The luminous as a moon uncloaked;
1026,THE NIGHT-WALK,"For proof that there, among earth's dumb,"
1027,THE NIGHT-WALK,A soul had passed and said our best.
1028,THE NIGHT-WALK,Or it might be we chimed on some
1029,THE NIGHT-WALK,"Historic favourite's astral crest,"
1030,THE NIGHT-WALK,"With part to reverence in its gleam,"
1031,THE NIGHT-WALK,And part to rivalry the shout:
1032,THE NIGHT-WALK,"So royal, unuttered, is youth's dream"
1033,THE NIGHT-WALK,Of power within to strike without.
1034,THE NIGHT-WALK,"But most the silences were sweet,"

1542,A GARDEN IDYL,"Then haply marvel, groan mayhap,"
1543,A GARDEN IDYL,To think such beauty means a trap.
1544,A GARDEN IDYL,"But Nature's genius, even man's"
1545,A GARDEN IDYL,"At best, is practical in plans;"
1546,A GARDEN IDYL,"Subservient to the needy thought,"
1547,A GARDEN IDYL,However rare the weapon wrought.
1548,A GARDEN IDYL,As long as Nature holds it good
1549,A GARDEN IDYL,To urge her creatures' quest for food
1550,A GARDEN IDYL,Will beauty stamp the just intent
1551,A GARDEN IDYL,Of weapons upon service bent.
1552,A GARDEN IDYL,For beauty is a flower of roots
1553,A GARDEN IDYL,Embedded lower than our boots;
1554,A GARDEN IDYL,"Out of the primal strata springs,"
1555,A GARDEN IDYL,And shows for crown of useful things
1556,A GARDEN IDYL,
1557,A GARDEN IDYL,Arachne's dream of prey to size
1558,A GARDEN IDYL,Aspired; so she could nigh despise
1559,A GARDEN IDYL,The puny specks the breezes round
1560,A GARDEN IDYL,"Supplied, and let them shake unwound;"
1561,A GARDEN IDYL,Assured of her fat fly to come;
1562,A GARDEN IDYL,"Perhaps a blue, the spider's plum;"
1563,A GARDEN IDYL,"Who takes the fatal odds in fight,"
1564,A GARDEN IDYL,"And gives repast an appetite,"
1565,A GARDEN IDYL,"By plunging, whizzing, till his wings"
1566,A GARDEN IDYL,"Are webbed, and in the lists he swings,"
1567,A GARDEN IDYL,"A shrouded lump, for her to see"
1568,A GARDEN IDYL,Her banquet in her victory.
1569,A GARDEN IDYL,
1570,A GARDEN IDYL,"This matron of the unnumbered threads,"
1571,A GARDEN IDYL,One day of dandelions' heads
1572,A GARDEN IDYL,Distributing their gray perruques
1573,A GARDEN IDYL,"Up every gust, I watched with looks"
1574,A GARDEN IDYL,Discreet beside the chalet-door;
1575,A GARDEN IDYL,"And gracefully a light wind bore,"
1576,A GARDEN IDYL,"Direct upon my webster's wall,"
1577,A GARDEN IDYL,A monster in the form of ball;
1578,A GARDEN IDYL,"The mildest captive ever snared,"
1579,A GARDEN IDYL,"That neither struggled nor despaired,"
1580,A GARDEN IDYL,"On half the net invading hung,"
1581,A GARDEN IDYL,"And plain as in her mother tongue,"
1582,A GARDEN IDYL,"While low the weaver cursed her lures,"
1583,A GARDEN IDYL,"Remarked, ""You have me; I am yours."""
1584,A GARDEN IDYL,
1585,A GARDEN IDYL,"Thrice magnified, in phantom shape,"
1586,A GARDEN IDYL,"Her dream of size she saw, agape."
1587,A GARDEN IDYL,Midway the vast round-raying beard
1588,A GARDEN IDYL,A desiccated midge appeared;
1589,A GARDEN IDYL,"Whose body pricked the name of meal,"
1590,A GARDEN IDYL,Whose hair had growth in earth's unreal;
1591,A GARDEN IDYL,"Provocative of dread and wrath,"
1592,A GARDEN IDYL,"Contempt and horror, in one froth,"
1593,A GARDEN IDYL,"Inextricable, insensible,"
1594,A GARDEN IDYL,"His poison presence there would dwell,"
1595,A GARDEN IDYL,"Declaring him her dream fulfilled,"
1596,A GARDEN IDYL,A catch to compliment the skilled;
1597,A GARDEN IDYL,"And she reduced to beaky skin,"
1598,A GARDEN IDYL,Disgraceful among kith and kin
1599,A GARDEN IDYL,
1600,A GARDEN IDYL,"Against her corner, humped and aged,"
1601,A GARDEN IDYL,"Arachne wrinkled, past enraged,"
1602,A GARDEN IDYL,Beyond disgust or hope in guile.
1603,A GARDEN IDYL,Ridiculously volatile
1604,A GARDEN IDYL,He seemed to her last spark of mind;
1605,A GARDEN IDYL,And that in pallid ash declined
1606,A GARDEN IDYL,"Beneath the blow by knowledge dealt,"
1607,A GARDEN IDYL,Wherein throughout her frame she felt
1608,A GARDEN IDYL,"That he, the light wind's libertine,"
1609,A GARDEN IDYL,"Without a scoff, without a grin,"
1610,A GARDEN IDYL,"And mannered like the courtly few,"
1611,A GARDEN IDYL,"Who merely danced when light winds blew,"
1612,A GARDEN IDYL,"Impervious to beak and claws,"
1613,A GARDEN IDYL,Tradition's ruinous Whitebeard was;
1614,A GARDEN IDYL,"Of whom, as actors in old scenes,"
1615,A GARDEN IDYL,"Had grannam weavers warned their weans,"
1616,A GARDEN IDYL,"With word, that less than feather-weight,"
1617,A GARDEN IDYL,He smote the web like bolt of Fate.
1618,A GARDEN IDYL,
1619,A GARDEN IDYL,"This muted drama, hour by hour,"
1620,A GARDEN IDYL,"I watched amid a world in flower,"
1621,A GARDEN IDYL,Ere yet Autumnal threads had laid
1622,A GARDEN IDYL,"Their gray-blue o'er the grass's blade,"
1623,A GARDEN IDYL,And still along the garden-run
1624,A GARDEN IDYL,"The blindworm stretched him, drunk of sun."
1625,A GARDEN IDYL,Arachne crouched unmoved; perchance
1626,A GARDEN IDYL,Her visitor performed a dance;
1627,A GARDEN IDYL,She puckered thinner; he the same
1628,A GARDEN IDYL,As when on that light wind he came.
1629,A GARDEN IDYL,
1630,A GARDEN IDYL,Next day was told what deeds of night
1631,A GARDEN IDYL,Were done; the web had vanished quite;
1632,A GARDEN IDYL,With it the strange opposing pair;
1633,A GARDEN IDYL,"And listless waved on vacant air,"
1634,A GARDEN IDYL,"For her adieu to heart's content,"
1635,A GARDEN IDYL,A solitary filament.
1636,A GARDEN IDYL,
1637,A GARDEN IDYL,
1638,A GARDEN IDYL,
1639,A GARDEN IDYL,
1640,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE
1641,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1642,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1643,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"SPRUNG of the father blood, the mother brain,"
1644,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Are they who point our pathway and sustain.
1645,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"They rarely meet; one soars, one walks retired."
1646,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"When they do meet, it is our earth inspired."
1647,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1648,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,To see Life's formless offspring and subdue
1649,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Desire of times unripe, we have these two,"
1650,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Whose union is right reason: join they hands,"
1651,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The world shall know itself and where it stands;
1652,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,What cowering angel and what upright beast
1653,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Make man, behold, nor count the low the least,"
1654,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Nor less the stars have round it than its flowers.
1655,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"When these two meet, a point of time is ours."
1656,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1657,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"As in a land of waterfalls, that flow"
1658,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Smooth for the leap on their great voice below,"
1659,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Some eddies near the brink borne swift along,"
1660,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Will capture hearing with the liquid song,"
1661,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"So, while the headlong world's imperious force"
1662,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Resounded under, heard I these discourse."
1663,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1664,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"First words, where down my woodland walk she led,"
1665,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"To her blind sister Patience, Foresight said:"
1666,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1667,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--Your faith in me appals, to shake my own,"
1668,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,When still I find you in this mire alone.
1669,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1670,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,--The few steps taken at a funeral pace
1671,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,By men had slain me but for those you trace.
1672,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1673,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--Look I once back, a broken pinion I:"
1674,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Black as the rebel angels rained from sky!
1675,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1676,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--Needs must you drink of me while here you live,"
1677,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,And make me rich in feeling I can give.
1678,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1679,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,--A brave To-be is dawn upon my brow:
1680,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Yet must I read my sister for the How.
1681,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,My daisy better knows her God of beams
1682,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Than doth an eagle that to mount him seems.
1683,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,She hath the secret never fieriest reach
1684,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Of wing shall master till men hear her teach.
1685,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1686,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--Liker the clod flaked by the driving plough,"
1687,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,My semblance when I have you not as now.
1688,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The quiet creatures who escape mishap
1689,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Bear likeness to pure growths of the green sap:
1690,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,A picture of the settled peace desired
1691,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,By cowards shunning strife or strivers tired.
1692,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,I listen at their breasts: is there no jar
1693,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Of wrestlings and of stranglings, dead they are,"
1694,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,And such a picture as the piercing mind
1695,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Ranks beneath vegetation.  Not resigned
1696,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Are my true pupils while the world is brute.
1697,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"What edict of the stronger keeps me mute,"
1698,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Stronger impels the motion of my heart.
1699,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,I am not Resignation's counterpart.
1700,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"If that I teach, 'tis little the dry word,"
1701,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Content, but how to savour hope deferred."
1702,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"We come of earth, and rich of earth may be;"
1703,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Soon carrion if very earth are we!
1704,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"The coursing veins, the constant breath, the use"
1705,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Of sleep, declare that strife allows short truce;"
1706,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Unless we clasp decay, accept defeat,"
1707,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"And pass despised; ""a-cold for lack of heat,"""
1708,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Like other corpses, but without death's plea."
1709,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1710,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,--My sister calls for battle; is it she?
1711,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1712,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--Rather a world of pressing men in arms,"
1713,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Than stagnant, where the sensual piper charms"
1714,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Each drowsy malady and coiling vice
1715,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,With dreams of ease whereof the soul pays price!
1716,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"No home is here for peace while evil breeds,"
1717,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"While error governs, none; and must the seeds"
1718,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"You sow, you that for long have reaped disdain,"
1719,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Lie barren at the doorway of the brain,"
1720,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Let stout contention drive deep furrows, blood"
1721,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Moisten, and make new channels of its flood!"
1722,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1723,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--My sober little maid, when we meet first,"
1724,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Drinks of me ever with an eager thirst.
1725,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,So can I not of her till circumstance
1726,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Drugs cravings.  Here we see how men advance
1727,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"A doubtful foot, but circle if much stirred,"
1728,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Like dead weeds on whipped waters.  Shout the word
1729,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Prompting their hungers, and they grandly march,"
1730,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,As to band-music under Victory's arch.
1731,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Thus was it, and thus is it; save that then"
1732,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The beauty of frank animals had men.
1733,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1734,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--Observe them, and down rearward for a term,"
1735,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Gaze to the primal twistings of the worm.
1736,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Thence look this way, across the fields that show"
1737,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Men's early form of speech for Yes and No.
1738,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,My sister a bruised infant's utterance had;
1739,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"And issuing stronger, to mankind 'twas mad."
1740,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,I knew my home where I had choice to feel
1741,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The toad beneath a harrow or a heel.
1742,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1743,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,--Speak of this Age.
1744,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1745,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,--When you it shall discern
1746,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Bright as you are, to me the Age will turn."
1747,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1748,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,--For neither of us has it any care;
1749,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Its learning is through Science to despair.
1750,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1751,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--Despair lies down and grovels, grapples not"
1752,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"With evil, casts the burden of its lot."
1753,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,This Age climbs earth.
1754,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1755,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,--To challenge heaven.
1756,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1757,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,--Not less
1758,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The lower deeps.  It laughs at Happiness!
1759,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"That know I, though the echoes of it wail,"
1760,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,For one step upward on the crags you scale.
1761,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Brave is the Age wherein the word will rust,"
1762,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Which means our soul asleep or body's lust,"
1763,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Until from warmth of many breasts, that beat"
1764,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"A temperate common music, sunlike heat"
1765,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The happiness not predatory sheds!
1766,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1767,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--But your fierce Yes and No of butting heads,"
1768,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Now rages to outdo a horny Past.
1769,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Shades of a wild Destroyer on the vast
1770,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Are thrown by every novel light upraised.
1771,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"The world's whole round smokes ominously, amazed"
1772,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,And trembling as its pregnant AEtna swells.
1773,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Combustibles on hot combustibles
1774,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Run piling, for one spark to roll in fire"
1775,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The mountain-torrent of infernal ire
1776,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,And leave the track of devils where men built.
1777,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Perceptive of a doom, the sinner's guilt"
1778,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Confesses in a cry for help shrill loud,"
1779,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"If drops the chillness of a passing cloud,"
1780,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"To conscience, reason, human love; in vain:"
1781,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,None save they but the souls which them contain.
1782,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"No extramural God, the God within"
1783,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Alone gives aid to city charged with sin.
1784,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"A world that for the spur of fool and knave,"
1785,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Sweats in its laboratory, what shall save?"
1786,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"But men who ply their wits in such a school,"
1787,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Must pray the mercy of the knave and fool.
1788,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1789,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,--Much have I studied hard Necessity!
1790,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"To know her Wisdom's mother, and that we"
1791,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,May deem the harshness of her later cries
1792,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"In labour a sure goad to prick the wise,"
1793,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"If men among the warnings which convulse,"
1794,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Can gravely dread without the craven's pulse.
1795,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Long ere the rising of this Age of ours,"
1796,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,The knave and fool were stamped as monstrous Powers.
1797,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Of human lusts and lassitudes they spring,"
1798,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,And are as lasting as the parent thing.
1799,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Yet numbering locust hosts, bent they to drill,"
1800,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,They might o'ermatch and have mankind at will.
1801,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1802,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Behold such army gathering: ours the spur,"
1803,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"No scattered foe to face, but Lucifer."
1804,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Not fool or knave is now the enemy
1805,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"O'ershadowing men, 'tis Folly, Knavery!"
1806,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,A sea; nor stays that sea the bastioned beach.
1807,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Now must the brother soul alive in each,"
1808,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,His traitorous individual devildom
1809,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Hold subject lest the grand destruction come.
1810,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Dimly men see it menacing apace
1811,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"To overthrow, perchance uproot the race."
1812,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Within, without, they are a field of tares:"
1813,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Fruitfuller for them when the contest squares,"
1814,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"And wherefore warrior service they must yield,"
1815,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Shines visible as life on either field.
1816,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"That is my comfort, following shock on shock,"
1817,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Which sets faith quaking on their firmest rock.
1818,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Since with his weapons, all the arms of Night,"
1819,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Frail men have challenged Lucifer to fight,"
1820,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Have matched in hostile ranks, enrolled, erect,"
1821,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"The human and Satanic intellect,"
1822,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Determined for their uses to control
1823,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"What forces on the earth and under roll,"
1824,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Their granite rock runs igneous; now they stand
1825,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Pledged to the heavens for safety of their land.
1826,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"They cannot learn save grossly, gross that are:"
1827,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Through fear they learn whose aid is good in war.
1828,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1829,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--My sister, as I read them in my glass,"
1830,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Their field of tares they take for pasture grass.
1831,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,How waken them that have not any bent
1832,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Save browsing--the concrete indifferent!
1833,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Friend Lucifer supplies them solid stuff:
1834,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,They fear not for the race when full the trough.
1835,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,They have much fear of giving up the ghost;
1836,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,And these are of mankind the unnumbered host.
1837,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1838,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--If I could see with you, and did not faint"
1839,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"In beating wing, the future I would paint."
1840,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Those massed indifferents will learn to quake:
1841,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Now meanwhile is another mass awake,"
1842,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Once denser than the grunters of the sty.
1843,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,If I could see with you!  Could I but fly!
1844,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1845,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--The length of days that you with them have housed,"
1846,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"An outcast else, approves their cause espoused."
1847,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1848,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--O true, they have a cause, and woe for us,"
1849,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,While still they have a cause too piteous!
1850,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Yet, happy for us when, their cause defined,"
1851,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"They walk no longer with a stumbler blind,"
1852,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"And quicken in the virtue of their cause,"
1853,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,To think me a poor mouther of old saws!
1854,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,I wait the issue of a battling Age;
1855,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"The toilers with your ""troughsters"" now engage;"
1856,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Instructing them through their acutest sense,"
1857,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,How close the dangers of indifference!
1858,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Already have my people shown their worth,"
1859,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"More love they light, which folds the love of Earth."
1860,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,That love to love of labour leads: thence love
1861,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Of humankind--earth's incense flung above.
1862,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1863,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--Admit some other features: Faithless, mean;"
1864,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Encased in matter; vowed to Gods obscene;
1865,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Contemptuous of the impalpable, it swells"
1866,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,On Doubt; for pastime swallows miracles;
1867,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"And if I bid it face what _I_ observe,"
1868,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Declares me hoodwinked by my optic nerve!
1869,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1870,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"--Oft has your prophet, for reward of toil,"
1871,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Seen nests of seeming cockatrices coil:
1872,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Disowned them as the unholiest of Time,"
1873,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Which were his offspring, born of flame on slime."
1874,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Nor him, their sire, have known the filial fry:"
1875,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,As little as Time's earliest knew the sky.
1876,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Perchance among them shoots a lustrous flame
1877,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"At intervals, in proof of whom they came."
1878,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,To strengthen our foundations is the task
1879,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Of this tough Age; not in your beams to bask,"
1880,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Though, lighted by your beams, down mining caves"
1881,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"The rock it blasts, the hoarded foulness braves."
1882,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,My sister sees no round beyond her mood;
1883,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,To hawk this Age has dressed her head in hood.
1884,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"Out of the course of ancient ruts and grooves,"
1885,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,It moves: O much for me to say it moves!
1886,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"About his AEthiop Highlands Nile is Nile,"
1887,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Though not the stream of the paternal smile:
1888,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"And where his tide of nourishment he drives,"
1889,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,An Abyssinian wantonness revives.
1890,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Calm as his lotus-leaf to-day he swims;
1891,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"He is the yellow crops, the rounded limbs,"
1892,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"The Past yet flowing, the fair time that fills;"
1893,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,Breath of all mouths and grist of many mills.
1894,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,
1895,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,"To-morrow, warning none with tempest-showers,"
1896,FORESIGHT AND PATIENCE,He is the vast Insensate who devours
