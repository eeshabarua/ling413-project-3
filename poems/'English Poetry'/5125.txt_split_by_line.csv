13,,"I, who of lighter love wrote many a verse,"
14,,"Made public never words inspired by thee,"
15,,Lest strangers’ lips should carelessly rehearse
16,,Things that were sacred and too dear to me.
17,,
18,,Thy soul was noble; through these fifteen years
19,,"Mine eyes familiar, found no fleck nor flaw,"
20,,"Stern to thyself, thy comrades’ faults and fears"
21,,Proved generously thine only law.
22,,
23,,Small joy was I to thee; before we met
24,,Sorrow had left thee all too sad to save.
25,,Useless my love--as vain as this regret
26,,That pours my hopeless life across thy grave.

31,L. H.,The Masters
32,L. H.,
33,L. H.,
34,L. H.,"Oh, Masters, you who rule the world,"
35,L. H.,"Will you not wait with me awhile,"
36,L. H.,"When swords are sheathed and sails are furled,"
37,L. H.,And all the fields with harvest smile?
38,L. H.,"I would not waste your time for long,"
39,L. H.,"I ask you but, when you are tired,"
40,L. H.,"To read how by the weak, the strong"
41,L. H.,Are weighed and worshipped and desired.
42,L. H.,
43,L. H.,"When weary of the Mart, the Loom,"
44,L. H.,"The Withering-house, the Riffle-blocks,"
45,L. H.,"The Barrack-square, the Engine-room,"
46,L. H.,"The pick-axe, ringing on the rocks,--"
47,L. H.,"When tents are pitched and work is done,"
48,L. H.,"While restful twilight broods above,"
49,L. H.,"By fresh-lit lamp, or dying sun,"
50,L. H.,See in my songs how women love.
51,L. H.,
52,L. H.,"We shared your lonely watch by night,"
53,L. H.,"We knew you faithful at the helm,"
54,L. H.,"Our thoughts went with you through the fight,"
55,L. H.,"That saved a soul,--or wrecked a realm"
56,L. H.,"Ah, how our hearts leapt forth to you,"
57,L. H.,"In pride and joy, when you prevailed,"
58,L. H.,"And when you died, serene and true:"
59,L. H.,--We wept in silence when you failed!
60,L. H.,
61,L. H.,"Oh, brain that did not gain the gold!"
62,L. H.,"Oh, arm, that could not wield the sword,"
63,L. H.,"Here is the love, that is not sold,"
64,L. H.,Here are the hearts to hail you Lord!
65,L. H.,
66,L. H.,You played and lost the game? What then?
67,L. H.,"The rules are harsh and hard we know,"
68,L. H.,"You, still, Oh, brothers, are the men"
69,L. H.,Whom we in secret reverence so.
70,L. H.,Your work was waste? Maybe your share
71,L. H.,Lay in the hour you laughed and kissed;
72,L. H.,Who knows but what your son shall wear
73,L. H.,The laurels that his father missed?
74,L. H.,
75,L. H.,"Ay, you who win, and you who lose,"
76,L. H.,"Whether you triumph,--or despair,--"
77,L. H.,When your returning footsteps choose
78,L. H.,"The homeward track, our love is there."
79,L. H.,"For, since the world is ordered thus,"
80,L. H.,"To you the fame, the stress, the sword,"
81,L. H.,"We can but wait, until to us"
82,L. H.,"You give yourselves, for our reward."
83,L. H.,
84,L. H.,"To Whaler’s deck and Coral beach,"
85,L. H.,"To lonely Ranch and Frontier-Fort,"
86,L. H.,Beyond the narrow bounds of speech
87,L. H.,I lay the cable of my thought.
88,L. H.,"I fain would send my thanks to you,"
89,L. H.,"(Though who am I, to give you praise?)"
90,L. H.,"Since what you are, and work you do,"
91,L. H.,Are lessons for our easier ways.
92,L. H.,
93,L. H.,"’Neath alien stars your camp-fires glow,"
94,L. H.,"I know you not,--your tents are far."
95,L. H.,"My hope is but in song to show,"
96,L. H.,How honoured and dear you are.
97,L. H.,
98,L. H.,
99,L. H.,I Shall Forget
100,L. H.,
101,L. H.,
102,L. H.,"Although my life, which thou hast scarred and shaken,"
103,L. H.,"Retains awhile some influence of thee,"
104,L. H.,"As shells, by faithless waves long since forsaken,"
105,L. H.,"Still murmur with the music of the Sea,"
106,L. H.,
107,L. H.,"I shall forget. Not thine the haunting beauty,"
108,L. H.,"Which, once beheld, for ever holds the heart,"
109,L. H.,"Or, if resigned from stress of Fate or Duty,"
110,L. H.,Takes part of life away:--the dearer part.
111,L. H.,
112,L. H.,I gave thee love; thou gavest but Desire.
113,L. H.,"Ah, the delusion of that summer night!"
114,L. H.,Thy soul vibrated at the rate of Fire;
115,L. H.,"Mine, with the rhythm of the waves of Light."
116,L. H.,
117,L. H.,"It is my love for thee that I regret,"
118,L. H.,"Not thee, thyself, and hence,--I shall forget!"
119,L. H.,
120,L. H.,
121,L. H.,"The Lament of Yasmini, the Dancing-Girl"
122,L. H.,
123,L. H.,
124,L. H.,"Ah, what hast thou done with that Lover of mine?"
125,L. H.,The Lover who only cared for thee?
126,L. H.,"Mine for a handful of nights, and thine"
127,L. H.,"For the Nights that Are and the Days to Be,"
128,L. H.,The scent of the Champa lost its sweet--
129,L. H.,So sweet is was in the Times that Were!--
130,L. H.,"Since His alone, of the numerous feet"
131,L. H.,"That climb my steps, have returned not there."
132,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, return not there!"
133,L. H.,
134,L. H.,"Art thou yet athrill at the touch of His hand,"
135,L. H.,Art thou still athirst for His waving hair?
136,L. H.,"Nay, passion thou never couldst understand,"
137,L. H.,Life’s heights and depths thou wouldst never dare.
138,L. H.,"The Great Things left thee untouched, unmoved,"
139,L. H.,The Lesser Things had thy constant care.
140,L. H.,"Ah, what hast thou done with the Lover I loved,"
141,L. H.,"Who found me wanting, and thee so fair?"
142,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, He found her fair!"
143,L. H.,
144,L. H.,"Nay, nay, the greatest of all was thine;"
145,L. H.,"The love of the One whom I craved for so,"
146,L. H.,But much I doubt if thou couldst divine
147,L. H.,"The Grace and Glory of Love, or know"
148,L. H.,The worth of the One whom thine arms embraced.
149,L. H.,"I may misjudge thee, but who can tell?"
150,L. H.,"So hard it is, for the one displaced,"
151,L. H.,To weigh the worth of a rival’s spell.
152,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, thy rival’s spell!"
153,L. H.,
154,L. H.,"And Thou, whom I loved: have the seasons brought"
155,L. H.,"That fair content, which allured Thee so?"
156,L. H.,Is it all that Thy delicate fancy wrought?
157,L. H.,Yasmini wonders; she may not know.
158,L. H.,"Yet never the Stars desert the sky,"
159,L. H.,"To fade away in the desolate Dawn,"
160,L. H.,"But Yasmini watches their glory die,"
161,L. H.,And mourns for her own Bright Star withdrawn.
162,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, the lonely dawn!"
163,L. H.,
164,L. H.,"Ah, never the lingering gold dies down"
165,L. H.,"In a sunset flare of resplendent light,"
166,L. H.,And never the palm-tree’s feathery crown
167,L. H.,"Uprears itself to the shadowy night,"
168,L. H.,"But Yasmini thinks of those evenings past,"
169,L. H.,When she prayed the glow of the glimmering West
170,L. H.,"To vanish quickly, that night, at last,"
171,L. H.,Might bring Thee back to her waiting breast.
172,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, how sweet that rest!"
173,L. H.,
174,L. H.,Yet I would not say that I always weep;
175,L. H.,"The force, that made such a desperate thing"
176,L. H.,"Of my love for Thee, has not fallen asleep,"
177,L. H.,"The blood still leaps, and the senses sing,"
178,L. H.,While other passion has oft availed.
179,L. H.,"(Other Love--Ah, my One, forgive!--)"
180,L. H.,"To aid, when Churus and Opium failed;--"
181,L. H.,I could not suffer so much and live.
182,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, who had to live!"
183,L. H.,
184,L. H.,"Nay, why should I say “Forgive” to Thee?"
185,L. H.,"To whom my lovers and I are naught,"
186,L. H.,"Who granted some passionate nights to me,"
187,L. H.,Then rose and left me with never a thought!
188,L. H.,"And yet, Ah, yet, for those Nights that Were,"
189,L. H.,"Thy passive limbs and thy loose loved hair,"
190,L. H.,"I would pay, as I _have_ paid, all these days,"
191,L. H.,With the love that kills and the thought that slays.
192,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, thy youth it slays!"
193,L. H.,
194,L. H.,"The youthful widow, with shaven hair,"
195,L. H.,"Whose senses ache for the love of a man,"
196,L. H.,"The young Priest, knowing that women are fair,"
197,L. H.,"Who stems his longing as best he can,"
198,L. H.,These suffer not as I suffer for Thee;
199,L. H.,"For the Soul desires what the senses crave,"
200,L. H.,"There will never be pleasure or peace for me,"
201,L. H.,"Since He who wounded, alone could save."
202,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, He will not save!"
203,L. H.,
204,L. H.,"The torchlight flares, and the lovers lean"
205,L. H.,"Towards Yasmini, with yearning eyes,"
206,L. H.,"Who dances, wondering what they mean,"
207,L. H.,"And gives cold kisses, and scant replies."
208,L. H.,"They talk of Love, she withholds the name,--"
209,L. H.,(Love came to her as a Flame of Fire!)
210,L. H.,From things that are only a weary shame;
211,L. H.,Trivial Vanity;--light Desire.
212,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, the light Desire!"
213,L. H.,
214,L. H.,"Yasmini bends to the praise of men,"
215,L. H.,"And looks in the mirror, upon her hand,[1]"
216,L. H.,To curse the beauty that failed her then--
217,L. H.,"Ah, none of her lovers can understand!"
218,L. H.,"How her whole life hung on that beauty’s power,"
219,L. H.,"The spell that waned at the final test,"
220,L. H.,"The charm that paled in the vital hour,--"
221,L. H.,"Which won so many,--yet lost the best!"
222,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, who lost the best!"
223,L. H.,
224,L. H.,"She leaves the dancing to reach the roof,"
225,L. H.,"With the lover who claims the passing hour,"
226,L. H.,"Her lips are his, but her eyes aloof"
227,L. H.,While the starlight falls in a silver shower.
228,L. H.,"Let him take what pleasure, what love, he may,"
229,L. H.,"He, too, will suffer e’er life be spent,--"
230,L. H.,But Yasmini’s soul has wandered away
231,L. H.,"To join the Lover, who came,--and went!"
232,L. H.,"Ahi, Yasmini, He came,--and went!"
233,L. H.,
234,L. H.,[1] Indian women wear a small mirror in a ring on their thumbs.

236,L. H.,
237,L. H.,Among the Rice Fields
238,L. H.,
239,L. H.,
240,L. H.,"She was fair as a Passion-flower,"
241,L. H.,(But little of love he knew.)
242,L. H.,"Her lucent eyes were like amber wine,"
243,L. H.,And her eyelids stained with blue.
244,L. H.,
245,L. H.,"He called them the Gates of Fair Desire,"
246,L. H.,"And the Lakes where Beauty lay,"
247,L. H.,"But I looked into them once, and saw"
248,L. H.,The eyes of Beasts of Prey.
249,L. H.,
250,L. H.,"He praised her teeth, that were small and white"
251,L. H.,"As lilies upon his lawn,"
252,L. H.,While I remembered a tiger’s fangs
253,L. H.,That met in a speckled fawn.
254,L. H.,
255,L. H.,"She had her way; a lover the more,"
256,L. H.,And I had a friend the less.
257,L. H.,For long there was nothing to do but wait
258,L. H.,And suffer his happiness.
259,L. H.,
260,L. H.,But now I shall choose the sharpest Kriss
261,L. H.,"And nestle it in her breast,"
262,L. H.,"For dead, he is drifting down to sea,"
263,L. H.,And his own hand wrought his rest
264,L. H.,
265,L. H.,
266,L. H.,The Bride
267,L. H.,
268,L. H.,
269,L. H.,"Beat on the Tom-toms, and scatter the flowers,"
270,L. H.,"Jasmin, Hibiscus, vermillion and white,"
271,L. H.,"This is the day, and the Hour of Hours,"
272,L. H.,Bring forth the Bride for her Lover’s delight.
273,L. H.,"Maidens no more, as a maiden shall claim her,"
274,L. H.,"Near, in his Mystery, draweth Desire."
275,L. H.,"Who, if she waver a moment, shall blame her?"
276,L. H.,"She is a flower, and love is a fire."
277,L. H.,Choti Tinchaurya syani hogayi!
278,L. H.,
279,L. H.,"Give her the anklets, the rings and the necklace,"
280,L. H.,"Darken her eyelids with delicate Art,"
281,L. H.,"Heighten the beauty, so youthful and fleckless,"
282,L. H.,"By the Gods favoured, oh, Bridegroom thou art!"
283,L. H.,"Twine in thy fingers her fingers so slender,"
284,L. H.,"Circle together the Mystical Fire,"
285,L. H.,"Bridegroom,--a whisper--be gentle and tender,"
286,L. H.,Choti Tinchaurya knows not desire.
287,L. H.,Abhi Tinchaurya syani hogayi!
288,L. H.,
289,L. H.,Bring forth the silks and the veil that shall cover
290,L. H.,"Beauty, till yesterday, careless and wild,"
291,L. H.,"Red are her lips for the kiss of a lover,"
292,L. H.,Ripe are her breasts for the lips of a child.
293,L. H.,"Centre and Shrine of Mysterious Power,"
294,L. H.,"Chalice of Pleasure and Rose of Delight,"
295,L. H.,"Shyly aware of the swift-coming hour,"
296,L. H.,"Waiting the shade and the silence of night,"
297,L. H.,Choti Tinchaurya syani hogayi!
298,L. H.,
299,L. H.,"Still must the Bridegroom his longing dissemble,"
300,L. H.,"Longing to loosen the silk-woven cord,"
301,L. H.,"Ah, how his fingers will flutter and tremble,"
302,L. H.,Fingers well skilled with the bridle and sword.
303,L. H.,"Thine is his valor oh, Bride, and his beauty,"
304,L. H.,"Thine to possess and re-issue again,"
305,L. H.,"Such is thy tender and passionate duty,"
306,L. H.,Licit thy pleasure and honoured thy pain.
307,L. H.,Choti Tinchaurya syani hogayi!
308,L. H.,
309,L. H.,"Choti Tinchaurya, lovely and tender,"
310,L. H.,Still all unbroken to sorrow and strife.
311,L. H.,"Come to the Bridegroom who, silk-clad and slender,"
312,L. H.,Brings thee the Honour and Burden of Life.
313,L. H.,"Bidding farewell to thy light-hearted playtime,"

321,L. H.,
322,L. H.,
323,L. H.,"Something compels me, somewhere. Yet I see"
324,L. H.,No clear command in Life’s long mystery.
325,L. H.,
326,L. H.,"Oft have I flung myself beside my horse,"
327,L. H.,"To drink the water from the roadside mire,"
328,L. H.,"And felt the liquid through my being course,"
329,L. H.,Stilling the anguish of my thirst’s desire.
330,L. H.,
331,L. H.,A simple want; so easily allayed;
332,L. H.,After the burning march; water and shade.
333,L. H.,
334,L. H.,Also I lay against the loved one’s heart
335,L. H.,"Finding fulfilment in that resting-place,"
336,L. H.,"Feeling my longing, quenched, was but a part"
337,L. H.,Of nature’s ceaseless striving for the race.
338,L. H.,
339,L. H.,"But now, I know not what they would with me;"
340,L. H.,"Matter or Force or God, if Gods there be."
341,L. H.,
342,L. H.,I wait; I question; Nature heeds me not.
343,L. H.,"She does but urge in answer to my prayer,"
344,L. H.,"“Arise and do!” Alas, she adds not what;"

350,L. H.,
351,L. H.,"I cast the Net of Memory,"
352,L. H.,"Man’s torment and delight,"
353,L. H.,Over the level Sands of Youth
354,L. H.,"That lay serenely bright,"
355,L. H.,Their tranquil gold at times submerged
356,L. H.,In the Spring Tides of Love’s Delight.
357,L. H.,
358,L. H.,"The Net brought up, in silver gleams,"
359,L. H.,Forgotten truth and fancies fair:
360,L. H.,"Like opal shells, small happy facts"
361,L. H.,Within the Net entangled were
362,L. H.,"With the red coral of his lips,"
363,L. H.,The waving seaweed of his hair.
364,L. H.,
365,L. H.,We were so young; he was so fair.

372,L. H.,But a golden moon above rose clear and free.
373,L. H.,The cactus thicket was ruddy with scarlet bloom
374,L. H.,"Where, through the silent shadow, he came to me.”"
375,L. H.,
376,L. H.,"“All my sixteen summers were but for this,"
377,L. H.,"That He should pass, and, pausing, find me fair."
378,L. H.,You Stars! bear golden witness! My lips were his;
379,L. H.,I would not live till others have fastened there.”

381,L. H.,"“Oh take me, Death, ere ever the charm shall fade,"
382,L. H.,"Ah, close these eyes, ere ever the dream grow dim."

394,L. H.,
395,L. H.,"Beauty, the Gift of Gifts, I give to thee."
396,L. H.,Pleasure and love shall spring around thy feet
397,L. H.,As through the lake the lotuses arise
398,L. H.,Pinkly transparent and divinely sweet.
399,L. H.,
400,L. H.,"I give thee eyes aglow like morning stars,"
401,L. H.,"Delicate brows, a mist of sable tresses,"

403,L. H.,Lit up by love and softened by caresses.
404,L. H.,
405,L. H.,For those who once were proud and softly bred
406,L. H.,"Shall, kneeling, wait thee as thou passest by,"
407,L. H.,They who were pure shall stretch forth eager hands
408,L. H.,"Crying, “Thy pity, Lord, before we die!”"
409,L. H.,
410,L. H.,"And one shall murmur, “If the sun at dawn"
411,L. H.,"Shall open and caress a happy flower,"
412,L. H.,"What blame to him, although the blossom fade"
413,L. H.,In the full splendour of his noontide power?”
414,L. H.,
415,L. H.,"And one, “If aloes close together grow"
416,L. H.,"It well may chance a plant shall wounded be,"
417,L. H.,"Pierced by the thorntips of another’s leaves,"
418,L. H.,Thus am I hurt unconsciously by thee.”
419,L. H.,
420,L. H.,"For some shall die and many more shall sin,"
421,L. H.,"Suffering for thy sake till seven times seven,"
422,L. H.,Because of those most perfect lips of thine
423,L. H.,Which held the power to make or mar their heaven.
424,L. H.,
425,L. H.,"And though thou givest back but cruelty,"
426,L. H.,"Their love, persistent, shall not heed nor care,"
427,L. H.,All those whose ears are fed with blame of thee
428,L. H.,"Shall say, “It may be so, but he was fair.”"

430,L. H.,"Ay, those who lost the whole of youth for thee,"
431,L. H.,"Made early and for ever, shamed and sad,"
432,L. H.,"Shall sigh, re-living some sweet memory,"
433,L. H.,"“Ah, once it was his will to make me glad.”"
434,L. H.,
435,L. H.,"Thy nights shall be as bright as summer days,"
436,L. H.,"The sequence of thy sins shall seem as duty,"
437,L. H.,"Since I have given thee, Oh, Gift of Gifts!--"
438,L. H.,The pale perfection of unrivalled beauty.
439,L. H.,
440,L. H.,
441,L. H.,Though in my Firmament thou wilt not shine
442,L. H.,
443,L. H.,
444,L. H.,"Talk not, my Lord, of unrequited love,"
445,L. H.,Since love requites itself most royally.
446,L. H.,"Do we not live but by the sun above,"
447,L. H.,And takes he any heed of thee or me?
448,L. H.,
449,L. H.,"Though in my firmament thou wilt not shine,"
450,L. H.,"Thy glory, as a Star, is none the less."
451,L. H.,"Oh, Rose, though all unplucked by hand of mine,"
452,L. H.,Still am I debtor to thy loveliness.

905,L. H.,Thy slender ankles bruised among the clods.
906,L. H.,"Oh, my Beloved, if I might worship thee!"
907,L. H.,Beauty is greater far than all the Gods.

910,L. H.,The Rice-boat
911,L. H.,
912,L. H.,
913,L. H.,I slept upon the Rice-boat
914,L. H.,"That, reef protected, lay"
915,L. H.,"At anchor, where the palm-trees"
916,L. H.,Infringe upon the bay.
917,L. H.,The windless air was heavy
918,L. H.,"With cinnamon and rose,"
919,L. H.,"The midnight calm seemed waiting,"
920,L. H.,Too fateful for repose.
921,L. H.,
922,L. H.,One joined me on the Rice-boat
923,L. H.,"With wild and waving hair,"
924,L. H.,Whose vivid words and laughter
925,L. H.,Awoke the silent air.
926,L. H.,"Oh, beauty, bare and shining,"
927,L. H.,"Fresh washen in the bay,"
928,L. H.,One well may love by moonlight
929,L. H.,What one would not love by day!
930,L. H.,
931,L. H.,Above among the cordage
932,L. H.,"The night wind hardly stirred,"
933,L. H.,The lapping of the ripples
934,L. H.,Was all the sound we heard.
935,L. H.,"Love reigned upon the Rice-boat,"
936,L. H.,"And Peace controlled the sea,"
937,L. H.,"The spirit’s consolation,"
938,L. H.,The senses’ ecstasy.
939,L. H.,
940,L. H.,Though many things and mighty
941,L. H.,"Are furthered in the West,"
942,L. H.,The ancient Peace has vanished
943,L. H.,Before To-day’s unrest.
944,L. H.,"For how among their striving,"
945,L. H.,"Their gold, their lust, their drink,"
946,L. H.,Shall men find time for dreaming
947,L. H.,Or any space to think?
948,L. H.,
949,L. H.,Think not I scorn the Science
950,L. H.,That lightens human pain;
951,L. H.,Though man’s reliance often
952,L. H.,Is placed on it in vain.
953,L. H.,"Maybe the long endeavour,"
954,L. H.,"The patience and the strife,"
955,L. H.,"May some day solve the riddle,"

957,L. H.,
958,L. H.,Perchance I do not value
959,L. H.,"Things Western as I ought,"
960,L. H.,"The trains,--that take us, whither?"
961,L. H.,"The ships,--that reach, what port?"
962,L. H.,To me it seems but chaos
963,L. H.,"Of greed and haste and rage,"
964,L. H.,"The endless, aimless, motion"
965,L. H.,Of squirrels in a cage.
966,L. H.,
967,L. H.,"Here, where some ruined temple"
968,L. H.,"In solitude decays,"
969,L. H.,With carven walls still hallowed
970,L. H.,"With prayers of bygone days,"
971,L. H.,"Here, where the coral outcrops"
972,L. H.,"Make “flowers of the sea,”"
973,L. H.,"The olden Peace yet lingers,"
974,L. H.,In hushed serenity.
975,L. H.,
976,L. H.,"Ah, silent, silver moonlight,"
977,L. H.,Whose charm impartial falls
978,L. H.,On tanks of sacred water
979,L. H.,"And squalid city walls,"
980,L. H.,Whose mystic whiteness hallows
981,L. H.,"The lowest and the least,"
982,L. H.,To thee men owe the glamour
983,L. H.,That draws them to the East.
984,L. H.,
985,L. H.,"And as this azure water,"
986,L. H.,"Unflecked hy wave or foam,"
987,L. H.,Conceals in its tranquillity
988,L. H.,"The dreaded white shark’s home,"
989,L. H.,So if love be illusion
990,L. H.,"I ask the dream to stay,"
991,L. H.,Content to love by moonlight
992,L. H.,What I might not love by day.
993,L. H.,

996,L. H.,
997,L. H.,

1001,L. H.,They might have given thee.
1002,L. H.,How could I know
1003,L. H.,That thou wouldst go
1004,L. H.,To sleep so far from me?
1005,L. H.,
1006,L. H.,"They took thee to the Burning-Ghat,"
1007,L. H.,"Oh, Lallji, my desire,"
1008,L. H.,And now a faint and lonely flame
1009,L. H.,Uprises from the pyre.
1010,L. H.,The thin grey smoke in spirals drifts
1011,L. H.,Across the opal sky.
1012,L. H.,"Would that I were a wife of thine,"
1013,L. H.,And thus with thee could die!
1014,L. H.,How could I know

1016,L. H.,"Oh, Lallji, my desire?"
1017,L. H.,The lips I missed
1018,L. H.,The flames have kissed
1019,L. H.,Upon the Sandal pyre.
1020,L. H.,
1021,L. H.,If one should meet me with a knife
1022,L. H.,"And cut my heart in twain,"
1023,L. H.,Then would he see the smoke arise
1024,L. H.,From every severed vein.
1025,L. H.,"Such is the burning, inward fire,"
1026,L. H.,"The anguish of my pain,"
1027,L. H.,"For my Beloved, whose dying lips"
1028,L. H.,Implored a kiss--in vain!

1030,L. H.,"That thou wouldst go,"
1031,L. H.,"Oh, Lallji, my desire?"
1032,L. H.,Too young thou art
1033,L. H.,To lay thy heart
1034,L. H.,Upon the Sandal pyre.
1035,L. H.,
1036,L. H.,Thy wife awaits her coming child;
1037,L. H.,"What were a child to me,"
1038,L. H.,If I might take thee in these arms
1039,L. H.,And face the flames with thee?
1040,L. H.,"The priests are chanting round the pyre,"
1041,L. H.,At dusk they will depart
1042,L. H.,"And leave to thee thy lonely rest,"
1043,L. H.,To me my lonelier heart.
1044,L. H.,How could I know
1045,L. H.,Thou lovedst me so?
1046,L. H.,Upon the Sandal pyre
1047,L. H.,He lies forsaken.

1373,I,Who was it held that Love was soothing or sweet?
1374,I,"Mine is a painful fire, at its whitest heat."
1375,I,
1376,I,Who said that Beauty was ever a gentle joy?
1377,I,Thine is a sword that flashes but to destroy.
1378,I,
1379,I,"Though mine eyes rose up from thy Beauty’s banquet, calm and refreshed,"
1380,I,"My lips, that were granted naught, can find no rest."
1381,I,
1382,I,"My soul was linked with thine, through speech and silent hours,"
1383,I,"As the sound of two soft flutes combined, or the scent of sister"
1384,I,flowers.
1385,I,
1386,I,"But the body, that wretched slave of the Sultan, Mind,"
1387,I,"Who follows his master ever, but far behind,"

1389,I,"Nothing was granted him, and every rebellious cell"
1390,I,"Rises up with angry protest, “It is not well!"

1395,II,II
1396,II,
1397,II,"Somewhere, Oh, My Beloved One, the house is standing,"
1398,II,Waiting for thee and me; for our first caresses.
1399,II,"It may be a river-boat, or a wave-washed landing,"
1400,II,"The shade of a tree in the jungle’s dim recesses,"
1401,II,"Some far-off mountain tent, ill-pitched and lonely,"
1402,II,Or the naked vault of the purple heavens only.
1403,II,
1404,II,"But the Place is waiting there; till the Hour shall show it,"
1405,II,"And our footsteps, following Fate, find it and know it."

1414,II,
1415,II,"The rice-birds fly so white, so silver white,"
1416,II,"The velvet rice-flats lie so emerald green,"
1417,II,"My heart inhales, with sorrowful delight,"
1418,II,The sweet and poignant sadness of the scene.
1419,II,
1420,II,"The swollen tawny river seeks the sea,"
1421,II,"Its hungry waters, never satisfied,"
1422,II,"Beflecked with fallen log and torn-up tree,"
1423,II,Engulph the fisher-huts on either side.
1424,II,
1425,II,"The current brought a stranger yesterday,"
1426,II,"And laid him on the sand beneath a palm,"
1427,II,"His worn young face was partly torn away,"
1428,II,"His eyes, that saw the world no more, were calm"
1429,II,
1430,II,"We could not close his eyelids, stiff with blood,--"
1431,II,"But, oh, my brother, I had changed with thee"
1432,II,"For I am still tormented in the flood,"
1433,II,"Whilst thou hast done thy work, and reached the sea."

1439,II,Fate has given me many a gift
1440,II,"To which men most aspire,"
1441,II,"Lovely, precious and costly things,"
1442,II,But not my heart’s desire.
1443,II,
1444,II,Many a man has a secret dream
1445,II,"Of where his soul would be,"
1446,II,Mine is a low verandah’d house
1447,II,In a tope beside the sea.
1448,II,
1449,II,"Over the roof tall palms should wave,"
1450,II,"Swaying from side to side,"
1451,II,Every night we should fall asleep
1452,II,To the rhythm of the tide.
1453,II,
1454,II,"The dawn should be gay with song of birds,"
1455,II,And the stir of fluttering wings.
1456,II,Surely the joy of life is hid
1457,II,In simple and tender things!
1458,II,
1459,II,At eve the waves would shimmer with gold
1460,II,"In the rosy sunset rays,"
1461,II,Emerald velvet flats of rice
1462,II,Would rest the landward gaze.
1463,II,
1464,II,A boat must rock at the laterite steps
1465,II,"In a reef-protected pool,"
1466,II,For we should sail through the starlit night
1467,II,When the winds were calm and cool.
1468,II,
1469,II,"I am so tired of all this world,"
1470,II,Its folly and fret and care.
1471,II,Find me a little scented home
1472,II,Amongst thy loosened hair.
1473,II,
1474,II,Give me a soft and secret place
1475,II,"Against thine amber breast,"
1476,II,"Where, hidden away from all mankind,"
1477,II,My soul may come to rest.
1478,II,
1479,II,Many a man has a secret dream
1480,II,Of where his life might be;
1481,II,"Mine is a lovely, lonely place"
1482,II,With sunshine and the sea.

1485,II,Sher Afzul
1486,II,
1487,II,
1488,II,"This was the tale Sher Afzul told to me,"
1489,II,"While the spent camels bubbled on their knees,"
1490,II,And ruddy camp-fires twinkled through the gloom
1491,II,Sweet with the fragrance from the Sinjib trees.
1492,II,
1493,II,"I had a friend who lay, condemned to death"
1494,II,"In gaol for murder, wholly innocent,"
1495,II,Yet caught in webs of luckless circumstance;--
1496,II,"Thou know’st how lies, of good and ill intent,"
1497,II,
1498,II,"Cluster like flies around a justice-court,"
1499,II,"Wheel within wheel, revolving screw on screw;--"
1500,II,"But from his prison he escaped and fled,"
1501,II,Keeping his liberty a night or two
1502,II,
1503,II,"Among the lonely hills, where, shackled still,"
1504,II,"He braved a village, seeking for a file"
1505,II,To loose his irons; alas! he lost his life
1506,II,Through the base sweetness of a woman’s smile.
1507,II,
1508,II,"Lovely she was, and young, who gave the youth"
1509,II,"Kind words, and promised succor and repose,"
1510,II,Till on the quilt of false security
1511,II,"He found exhausted sleep; but, ere he rose,"
1512,II,
1513,II,"Entered the guards, brought by her messenger."
1514,II,"Thus was he captured, slain, and on her breast"
1515,II,"Soon shone the guerdon of her treachery,"
1516,II,The price of blood; in gold made manifest.
1517,II,
1518,II,I might have killed her? Brave men have died thus.
1519,II,Revenge demanded keener punishment.
1520,II,"So I walked softly on those lilac hills,"
1521,II,Touching my _rhibab_ lightly as I went.
1522,II,
1523,II,I found her fair: ’t was no unpleasant task
1524,II,"In the young spring-time when the fruit-trees flower,"
1525,II,"To pass her door, and pause, and pass again,"
1526,II,Shading mine eyes against her beauty’s power.
1527,II,
1528,II,"Warmly I wooed her, while the almond trees"
1529,II,Broke into fragile clouds of rosy snow.
1530,II,"Her dawning passion feared her lord’s return,"
1531,II,"Ever she pleaded softly, “Let us go.”"
1532,II,
1533,II,"But I spoke tenderly, and said, “Beloved,"
1534,II,Shall not thy lips give orders to my heart?
1535,II,Yet there is one small matter in these hills
1536,II,Claiming attention ere I can depart.
1537,II,
1538,II,“Let us not waste these days; thine absent lord
1539,II,"Cannot return, thou know’st, before the snow"
1540,II,"Has melted, and the almond fruits appear.”"
1541,II,"This time she answered, “Naught but thee I know!”"
1542,II,
1543,II,I too was young; I could have loved her well
1544,II,When her soft eyes across the twilight burned;
1545,II,"But suddenly, around her amber neck,"
1546,II,The golden beads would sparkle as she turned.
1547,II,
1548,II,_And I remembered_; swift mine eyelids fell
1549,II,"To hide the hate that festered in my soul,"
1550,II,"Ever more deeply, with the rising fear"
1551,II,That Love might wrench Revenge from my control.
1552,II,
1553,II,"But when at last she, acquiescent, lay"
1554,II,"In the sweet-scented shadow of the firs,"
1555,II,"Lovely and broken, granting--asking--all,"
1556,II,It was _his_ eyes I met: not hers--not hers!
1557,II,
1558,II,* * *
1559,II,
1560,II,"Three months I waited: all the village talked,"
1561,II,And ever anxiously she urged our flight.
1562,II,"Yet still I lingered, till her beauty paled,"
1563,II,And wearily she came to me at night.
1564,II,
1565,II,"Then, seeing Love, subservient to Revenge,"
1566,II,"Had well achieved his own creative end,"
1567,II,"And in his work must soon be manifest,"
1568,II,"Compassing thus my duty to my friend,"
1569,II,
1570,II,"One tranquil, sultry night I rode away"
1571,II,"Till far behind the purple hills were dim,"
1572,II,"Exulting in my spirit, “Thus I leave"
1573,II,"Her to her fate, and my revenge to him!”"
1574,II,
1575,II,"Swiftly he struck, her lord; the body lay"
1576,II,"With hacked-off breasts, dishonoured, in the Pass."
1577,II,"Months later, riding lonely through the gorge,"
1578,II,"I saw it still, among the long-grown grass."
1579,II,
1580,II,It was well done; my soul is satisfied.
1581,II,"Friendship is sweet, and Love is sweeter still,"
1582,II,But Vengeance has a savour all its own--
1583,II,A strange delight--well known to those who kill.
1584,II,
1585,II,"Such was the story Afzul told to me,"
1586,II,"While wood-fires crackled in the evening breeze,"
1587,II,And blows on hammered tent-pegs stirred the air
1588,II,Sweet with the fragrance from the Sinjib trees.
1589,II,
1590,II,"Tent-like, above, up-held by jagged peaks,"
1591,II,The heavy purple of the tranquil sky
1592,II,"Shed its oft-broken promises of peace,"
1593,II,While twinkling stars bemocked the worn-out lie!
1594,II,
1595,II,
1596,II,"Nay, not To-night"
1597,II,
1598,II,
1599,II,"Nay, not to-night;--the slow, sad rain is falling"
1600,II,"Sorrowful tears, beneath a grieving sky,"
1601,II,"Far off a famished jackal, faintly calling,"
1602,II,Renders the dusk more lonely with its cry.
1603,II,
1604,II,"The mighty river rushes, sobbing, seawards,"
1605,II,"The shadows shelter faint mysterious fears,"
1606,II,"I turn mine eyes for consolation theewards,"
1607,II,And find thy lashes tremulous with tears.
1608,II,
1609,II,"If some new soul, asearch for incarnation,"
1610,II,"Should, through our kisses, enter Life again,"
1611,II,"It would inherit all our desolation,"
1612,II,All the soft sorrow of the slanting rain.
1613,II,
1614,II,"When thou desirest Love’s supreme surrender,"
1615,II,"Come while the morning revels in the light,"
1616,II,"Bulbuls around us, passionately tender,"
1617,II,Singing among the roses red and white.
1618,II,
1619,II,"Thus, if it be my sweet and sacred duty,"
1620,II,"Subservient to the Gods’ divine decree,"
1621,II,"To give the world again thy vivid beauty,"
1622,II,I should transmit it with my joy in thee.
1623,II,
1624,II,"I could not if I would, Beloved, deceive thee."
1625,II,Wouldst thou not feel at once a feigned caress?
1626,II,"Yet, do not rise, I would not have thee leave me,"
1627,II,My soul needs thine to share its loneliness.
1628,II,
1629,II,"Let the dim starlight, when the low clouds sunder,"
1630,II,Silver the perfect outline of thy face.
1631,II,Such faces had the saints; I only wonder
1632,II,That thine has sought my heart for resting-place.
1633,II,
1634,II,
1635,II,The Dying Prince
1636,II,
1637,II,
1638,II,"There are no days for me any more, for the dawn is dark with tears,"
1639,II,"There is no rest for me any more, for the night is thick with fears."
1640,II,"There are no flowers nor any fruit, for the sorrowful locusts came,"
1641,II,"And the garden is but a memory, the vineyard only a name."
1642,II,
1643,II,"There is no light in the empty sky, no sail upon the sea,"
1644,II,"Birds are yet on their nests perchance, but they sing no more to me."
1645,II,Past--vanished--faded away--all the joys that were.
1646,II,My youth died down in a swift decline when they married her to despair.
1647,II,
1648,II,"“My lord, the crowd in the Audience Hall; how long wilt thou have them"
1649,II,wait?”
1650,II,I have given my father’s younger son the guidance of the State.
1651,II,"“The steeds are saddled, the Captains call for the orders of the day.”"
1652,II,Tell them that I shall ride no more to the hunting or the fray.
1653,II,
1654,II,"“Sweet the scent of the Moghra flowers;” Brother, it may be so."
1655,II,"“The young, flushed spring is with us again.” Is it? I did not know."
1656,II,"“The Zamorin’s daughter draweth near, on slender golden feet;”"
1657,II,"Oh, a curse upon all sweet things say I, to whom they are no more sweet!"
1658,II,
1659,II,Dost think that a man as sick as I can compass a woman’s ease?
1660,II,That the sons of a man who is like to me could ever find rest or peace?
1661,II,"Tell them to marry them where they will, if their longing be so sore,"
1662,II,"Such are the things that all men seek, but I shall seek no more."
1663,II,
1664,II,"All my muscles are fallen in, and the blood deserts my veins,"
1665,II,"Every fibre and bone of me is waxen full of pains,"
1666,II,"The iron feet of mine enemy’s curse are heavy upon my head,"
1667,II,"Look at me and judge for thyself, thou seest I am but dead."
1668,II,
1669,II,"“Then, who is it, Prince, who has done this thing, has sown such a"
1670,II,"bitter seed,"
1671,II,"That we hale him forth to the Market-place, bind him and let him bleed,"
1672,II,"That the flesh may shudder and wince and writhe, reddening ’neath the"
1673,II,rod.”
1674,II,"Love is the evil-doer, alas! and how shalt thou scourge a God?"
1675,II,
1676,II,
1677,II,The Hut
1678,II,
1679,II,
1680,II,"Dear little Hut by the rice-fields circled,"
1681,II,That cocoa-nuts shade above.
1682,II,"I hear the voices of children singing,"
1683,II,And that means love.
1684,II,
1685,II,"When shall the traveller’s march be over,"
1686,II,When shall his wandering cease?
1687,II,"This little homestead is bare and simple,"
1688,II,And that means peace.
1689,II,
1690,II,Nay! to the road I am not unfaithful;
1691,II,In tents let my dwelling be!
1692,II,I am not longing for Peace or Passion
1693,II,"From any one else but thee,"
1694,II,"My Krishna,"
1695,II,Any one else but thee!
1696,II,
1697,II,
1698,II,My Paramour was Loneliness
1699,II,
1700,II,
1701,II,My paramour was loneliness
1702,II,"And lying by the sea,"
1703,II,Soft songs of sorrow and distress
1704,II,He did beget in me.
1705,II,
1706,II,Later another lover came
1707,II,"More meet for my desire,"
1708,II,“Radiant Beauty” was his name;
1709,II,His sons had wings of fire!
1710,II,
1711,II,
1712,II,The Rice was under Water
1713,II,
1714,II,
1715,II,"The Rice was under water, and the land was scourged with rain,"
1716,II,"The nights were desolation, and the day was born in pain."
1717,II,"Ah, the famine and the fever and the cruel, swollen streams,"
1718,II,"I had died, except for Krishna, who consoled me--in my dreams!"
1719,II,
1720,II,"The Burning-Ghats were smoking, and the jewels melted down,"
1721,II,"The Temples lay deserted, for the people left the town."
1722,II,"Yet I was more than happy, though passing strange it seems,"
1723,II,"For I spent my nights with Krishna, who loved me--in my dreams!"
1724,II,
1725,II,
1726,II,“Surface Rights”
1727,II,
1728,II,
1729,II,"Drifting, drifting down the River,"
1730,II,"Tawny current and foam-flecked tide,"
1731,II,"Sorrowful songs of lonely boatmen,"
1732,II,Mournful forests on either side.
1733,II,
1734,II,"Thine are the outcrops’ glittering blocks,"
1735,II,"The quartz where the rich pyrites gleam,"
1736,II,The golden treasure of unhewn rocks
1737,II,And the loose gold in the stream.
1738,II,
1739,II,"But,--the dim vast forests along the shore,"
1740,II,"That whisper wonderful things o’ nights,--"
1741,II,"These are things that I value more,"
1742,II,My beautiful “surface rights.”
1743,II,
1744,II,"Drifting, drifting down the River,--"
1745,II,Stars a-tremble about the sky--
1746,II,"Ah, my lover, my heart is breaking,"
1747,II,"Breaking, breaking, I know not why."
1748,II,
1749,II,Why is Love such a sorrowful thing?
1750,II,This I never could understand;
1751,II,"Pain and passion are linked together,"
1752,II,Ever I find them hand in hand.
1753,II,
1754,II,"Loose thy hair in its soft profusion,"
1755,II,"Let thy lashes caress thy cheek,--"
1756,II,"These are the things that express thy spirit,"
1757,II,What is the need to explain or speak?
1758,II,
1759,II,"Drifting, drifting along the River,"
1760,II,"Under the light of a wan low moon,"
1761,II,"Steady, the paddles; Boatmen, steady,--"
1762,II,Why should we reach the sea so soon?
1763,II,
1764,II,"See where the low spit cuts the water,"
1765,II,What is that misty wavering light?
1766,II,Only the pale datura flowers
1767,II,Blossoming through the silent night.
1768,II,
1769,II,What is the fragrance in thy tresses?
1770,II,’T is the scent of the champa’s breath;
1771,II,The meaning of champa bloom is passion--
1772,II,And of datura--death!
1773,II,
1774,II,"Sweet are thy ways and thy strange caresses,"
1775,II,"That sear as flame, and exult as wine."
1776,II,But I care only for that wild moment
1777,II,When my soul arises and reaches thine.
1778,II,
1779,II,Wistful voices of wild birds calling--
1780,II,"Far, faint lightning towards the West,--"
1781,II,"Twinkling lights of a Tyah homestead,--"
1782,II,Ruddy glow on a girl’s bare breast--
1783,II,
1784,II,"Drifting boats on a mournful River,"
1785,II,"Shifting thoughts in a dreaming mind,--"
1786,II,"We two, seeking the Sea, together,--"
1787,II,"When we reach it,--what shall we find?"
1788,II,
1789,II,
1790,II,Shivratri (the Night of Shiva)
1791,II,
1792,II,(While the procession passed at Ramesram)
1793,II,
1794,II,
1795,II,Nearer and nearer cometh the car
1796,II,"Where the Golden Goddess towers,"
1797,II,Sweeter and sweeter grows the air
1798,II,From a thousand trampled flowers.
1799,II,We two rest in the Temple shade
1800,II,"Safe from the pilgrim flood,"
1801,II,This path of the Gods in olden days
1802,II,Ran royally red with blood.
1803,II,
1804,II,Louder and louder and louder yet
1805,II,Throbs the sorrowful drum--
1806,II,"That is the tortured world’s despair,"
1807,II,Never a moment dumb.
1808,II,"Shriller and shriller shriek the flutes,"
1809,II,Nature’s passionate need--
1810,II,"Paler and paler grow my lips,"
1811,II,And still thou bid’st them bleed.
1812,II,
1813,II,"Deeper and deeper and deeper still,"
1814,II,Never a pause for pain--
1815,II,Darker and darker falls the night
1816,II,That golden torches stain.
1817,II,"Closer, ah! closer, and still more close,"
1818,II,Till thy soul reach my soul--
1819,II,"Further, further, out on the tide"
1820,II,From the shores of self-control.
1821,II,
1822,II,"Glowing, glowing, to whitest heat,"
1823,II,"Thy feverish passions burn,"
1824,II,"Fiercer and fiercer, cruelly fierce,"
1825,II,To thee my senses yearn.
1826,II,Fainter and fainter runs my blood
1827,II,With desperate fight for breath--
1828,II,"This, my Beloved, thou sayest is Love,"
1829,II,Or I should have deemed it Death!
1830,II,
1831,II,
1832,II,The First Wife
1833,II,
1834,II,
1835,II,"Ah, my lord, are the tidings true,"
1836,II,That thy mother’s jewels are shapen anew?
1837,II,
1838,II,"I hear that a bride has chosen been,"
1839,II,"The stars consulted, the parents seen."
1840,II,
1841,II,"Had I been childless, had never there smiled"
1842,II,"The brilliant eyes from the face of a child,"
1843,II,
1844,II,Then at least I had understood
1845,II,This thing they tell me thou findest good.
1846,II,
1847,II,"But I have been down to the River of Death,"
1848,II,"With painful footsteps and shuddering breath,"
1849,II,
1850,II,"Seven times; thou hast daughters three,"
1851,II,And four young sons who are fair as thee.
1852,II,
1853,II,"I am not unlovely, over my head"
1854,II,Not twenty summers as yet have sped.
1855,II,
1856,II,’T is eleven years since my opening life
1857,II,Was given to thee by my father’s wife.
1858,II,
1859,II,"Ah, those days--They were lovely to me,"
1860,II,When little and shy I waited for thee.
1861,II,
1862,II,"Till I locked my arms round my lover above,"
1863,II,A child in form but a woman in love.
1864,II,
1865,II,"And I bore thy sons, as a woman should,"
1866,II,"Year by year, as is meet and good."
1867,II,
1868,II,Thy mother was ever content with me--
1869,II,"And Oh, Beloved, I worshipped thee!"
1870,II,
1871,II,"And now it’s over; alas, my lord,"
1872,II,Better I felt thy sharpest sword.
1873,II,
1874,II,I hear she is youthful and fair as I
1875,II,When I came to thee in the days gone by.
1876,II,
1877,II,Her breasts are firmer; this bosom slips
1878,II,"Somewhat, weighted by children’s lips."
1879,II,
1880,II,"But they were thy children. Oh, lord my king,"
1881,II,"Ah, why hast thy heart devised this thing?"
1882,II,
1883,II,"I am not as the women of this thy land,"
1884,II,"Meek and timid, broken to hand."
1885,II,
1886,II,"From the distant North I was given to thee,"
1887,II,"Whose daughters are passionate, fierce and free,"
1888,II,
1889,II,"I could not dwell by a rival’s side,"
1890,II,"I seek a bridegroom, as thou a bride."
1891,II,
1892,II,"The night she yieldeth her youth to thee,"
1893,II,Death shall take his pleasure in me.
1894,II,
1895,II,
1896,II,I Arise and go Down to the River
1897,II,
1898,II,
1899,II,"I arise and go down to the River, and currents that come from the sea,"
1900,II,"Still fresh with the salt of the ocean, are lovely and precious to me,"
1901,II,"The waters are silver and silent, except where the kingfisher dips,"
1902,II,Or the ripples wash off from my shoulder the reddening stain of thy
1903,II,lips.
1904,II,
1905,II,Two things make my joy at this moment: thy gold-coloured beauty by
1906,II,"night,"
1907,II,"And the delicate charm of the River, all pale in the day-breaking light,"
1908,II,"So cool are the waters’ caresses. Ah, which is the lovelier,--this?"
1909,II,"Or the fire that it kindles at midnight, beneath the soft glow of thy"
1910,II,kiss?
1911,II,
1912,II,"Ah, Love has a mighty dominion, he forges with passionate breath"
1913,II,"The links which stretch out to the Future, with forces of life and of"
1914,II,"death,"
1915,II,"But great is the charm of the River, so soft is the sigh of the reeds,"
1916,II,"They give me, long sleepless from passion, the peace that my weariness"
1917,II,needs.
1918,II,
1919,II,"I float on the breast of my River, and startle the birds on the edge,"
1920,II,"To land on a newly found island, a boat that is caught in the sedge,"
1921,II,"The rays of the sun are still level, not yet has the heat of the day"
1922,II,"Deflowered the mists of the morning, that linger in delicate grey."
1923,II,
1924,II,What land was his dwelling whose fancy first gave unto Paradise birth?
1925,II,"He never had swum in my River, or else he had fixed it on earth!"
1926,II,"Oh, grace of the palm-tree reflections, Oh, sense of the wind from the"
1927,II,sea!
1928,II,"Oh, divine and serene exultation of one who is lonely and free!"
1929,II,
1930,II,"Ah, delicate breezes of daybreak, so scentless, refreshing and free!"
1931,II,And yet--had my midnight been lonely you had been less lovely to me.
1932,II,"This coolness comes laden with solace, because I am hot from the fire,"
1933,II,As often devotion to virtue arises from sated desire.
1934,II,
1935,II,_Gautama came forth from his Palace; he felt the night wind on his
1936,II,"face,_"
1937,II,"_He loathed, as he left, the embraces, the softness and scent of the"
1938,II,"place,_"
1939,II,"_But, ah, if his night had been loveless, with no one to solace his"
1940,II,"need,_"
1941,II,_He never had written that sermon which men so devotedly read._
1942,II,
1943,II,"Ah, River, thy gentle persuasion! I doubt if I seek any more"
1944,II,The beauty that hurts me and holds me beneath the low roof on the shore.
1945,II,"I loved thee, ay, loved--for a season, but thou, was it love or desire,"
1946,II,"The glow of the Sun in his glory, or only the heat of a fire?"
1947,II,
1948,II,"I think not that thou wilt regret me, for thou art too joyous and fair,"
1949,II,"So many are keen to caress thee, thy passionate midnights to share."
1950,II,"Thou wilt not have time to remember, before a new love-knot is tied,"
1951,II,"The stranger who loved thee and left thee, who drifted away on the tide."
1952,II,
1953,II,"Two things I have found that are lovely, though most things are sullen"
1954,II,and grey;
1955,II,One: Peace--but what mortal has found him; and Passion--but when would
1956,II,he stay?
1957,II,"So I shall return to my River, and floating at ease on its breast,"
1958,II,"Shall find, what Love never has given--a sense of most infinite rest."
1959,II,
1960,II,"When the years have gone by and departed, what thought shall I keep of"
1961,II,this land?
1962,II,A curl of thy waist-reaching-tresses? a flower received from thy hand?
1963,II,"Nay, if I can fathom the future, I fancy my relic will be"
1964,II,"Some shell, my beloved one, the River, has stol’n from the store of the"
1965,II,sea.
1966,II,
1967,II,
1968,II,"Listen, Beloved"
1969,II,
1970,II,
1971,II,"Listen, Beloved, the Casurinas quiver,"
1972,II,"Each tassel prays the wind to set it free,"
1973,II,"Hark to the frantic sobbing of the river,"
1974,II,Wild to attain extinction in the sea.
1975,II,All Nature blindly struggles to dissolve
1976,II,"In other forms and forces, thus to solve"
1977,II,The painful riddle of identity.
1978,II,"Ah, that my soul might lose itself in thee!"
1979,II,
1980,II,"Yet, my Beloved One, wherefore seek I union,"
1981,II,"Since there is no such thing in all the world,--"
1982,II,"Are not our spirits linked in close communion,--"
1983,II,And on my lips thy clinging lips are curled?
1984,II,"Thy tender arms are round my shoulders thrown,"
1985,II,"I hear thy heart more loudly than my own,"
1986,II,"And yet, to my despair, I know thee far,"
1987,II,"As in the stellar darkness, star from star."
1988,II,
1989,II,Even in times when love with bounteous measure
1990,II,"A simultaneous joy on us has shed,"
1991,II,"In the last moment of delirious pleasure,"
1992,II,"Ere the sense fail, or any force be fled,"
1993,II,"My rapture has been even as a wall,"
1994,II,Shutting out any thought of thee at all!
1995,II,"My being, by its own delight possessed,"
1996,II,Forgot that it was sleeping on thy breast.
1997,II,
1998,II,"Ay, from his birth each man is vowed and given"
1999,II,"To a vast loneliness, ungauged, unspanned,"
2000,II,"Whether by pain and woe his soul be riven,"
2001,II,Or all fair pleasures clustered ’neath his hand.
2002,II,"His gain by day, his ecstasy by night,--"
2003,II,"His force, his folly, fierce or faint delight,--"
2004,II,"Suffering or sorrow, fortune, feud, or care,--"
2005,II,"Whate’er he find or feel,--he may not share."
2006,II,
2007,II,"Lonely we join the world, and we depart"
2008,II,"Even as lonely, having lived alone,"
2009,II,"The breast that feeds us, the beloved one’s heart,"
2010,II,"The lips we kiss,--or curse--alike unknown."
2011,II,"Ay, even these lips of thine, so often kissed,"
2012,II,What certitude have I that they exist?
2013,II,"Alas, it is the truth, though harsh it seems,"
2014,II,I have been loved as sweetly in my dreams.
2015,II,
2016,II,"Therefore if I should seem too fiercely fond,"
2017,II,"Too swift to love, too eager to attain,"
2018,II,Forgive the fervour that would forge beyond
2019,II,The limits set to mortal joy and pain.
2020,II,"Knowing the soul’s unmeasured loneliness,"
2021,II,"My passion must be mingled with distress,"
2022,II,"As I, despairing, struggle to draw near"
2023,II,What is as unattainable as dear.
2024,II,
2025,II,"Thirst may be quenched at any kindly river,"
2026,II,Rest may be found ’neath any arching tree.
2027,II,"No sleep allures, no draughts of love deliver"
2028,II,My spirit from its aching need of thee.
2029,II,"Thy sweet assentiveness to my demands,"
2030,II,"All the caressive touches of thy hands,--"
2031,II,"These soft cool hands, with fingers tipped with fire,--"
2032,II,They can do nothing to assuage desire.
2033,II,
2034,II,Sometimes I think my longing soul remembers
2035,II,"A previous love to which it aims and strives,"
2036,II,As if this fire of ours were but the embers
2037,II,Of some wild flame burnt out in former lives.
2038,II,Perchance in earlier days I _did_ attain
2039,II,"That which I seek for now so all in vain,"
2040,II,Maybe my soul with thine _was_ fused and wed
2041,II,"In some great night, long since dissolved and dead."
2042,II,
2043,II,We may progress; but who shall answer clearly
2044,II,The riddle of the endless change of things.
2045,II,"Perchance in other days men loved more dearly,"
2046,II,"Or Love himself had wider ways and wings,"
2047,II,"Maybe we gave ourselves with less control,"
2048,II,"Or simpler living left more free the soul,"
2049,II,"So that with ease the flesh aside was flung,--"
2050,II,Or was it merely that _Mankind was young?_
2051,II,
2052,II,Or has my spirit a divine prevision
2053,II,"Of vast vague passions stored in days to be,"
2054,II,When some strong souls shall conquer their division
2055,II,"And two shall be as one, eternally?"
2056,II,"Finding at last upon each other’s breast,"
2057,II,"Unutterable calm and infinite rest,"
2058,II,While love shall burn with such intense a glow
2059,II,"That both shall die, and neither heed or know."
2060,II,
2061,II,"Why do I question thus, and wake confusion"
2062,II,"In the soft thought that lights thy perfect face,"
2063,II,"Ah, shed once more thy perfumed hair’s profusion,"
2064,II,Open thine arms and make my resting place.
2065,II,"Lay thy red lips on mine as heretofore,"
2066,II,"Grant me the treasure of thy beauty’s store,"
2067,II,"Stifle all thought in one imperious kiss,--"
2068,II,"What shall I ask for more than this,--and this?"
2069,II,
2070,II,
2071,II,"Oh, Unforgotten and Only Lover"
2072,II,
2073,II,
2074,II,"Oh, unforgotten and only lover,"
2075,II,"Many years have swept us apart,"
2076,II,But none of the long dividing seasons
2077,II,Slay your memory in my heart.
2078,II,In the clash and clamour of things unlovely
2079,II,"My thoughts drift back to the times that were,"
2080,II,"When I, possessing thy pale perfection,"
2081,II,Kissed the eyes and caressed the hair.
2082,II,
2083,II,Other passions and loves have drifted
2084,II,"Over this wandering, restless soul,"
2085,II,"Rudderless, chartless, floating always"
2086,II,With some new current of chance control.
2087,II,But thine image is clear in the whirling waters--
2088,II,"Ah, forgive--that I drag it there,"
2089,II,For it is so part of my very being
2090,II,That where I wander it too must fare.
2091,II,
2092,II,"Ah, I have given thee strange companions,"
2093,II,To thee--so slender and chaste and cool--
2094,II,But a white star loses no glimmer of beauty
2095,II,In all the mud of a miry pool
2096,II,That holds the grace of its white reflection;
2097,II,"Nothing could fleck thee, nothing could stain,"
2098,II,Thou hast made a home for thy delicate beauty
2099,II,Where all things peaceful and lovely reign.
2100,II,
2101,II,Doubtless the night that my soul remembers
2102,II,"Was a sin to thee, and thine only one."
2103,II,"Thou thinkest of it, if thou thinkest ever,"
2104,II,"As a crime committed, a deed ill done."
2105,II,"But for me, the broken, the desert-dweller,"
2106,II,"Following Life through its underways,--"
2107,II,I know if those midnights thou hadst not granted
2108,II,I had not lived through these after days.
2109,II,
2110,II,"And that had been well for me; all would say so,"
2111,II,What have I done since I parted from thee?
2112,II,"But things that are wasted, and full of ruin,"
2113,II,"All unworthy, even of me."
2114,II,"Yet, it was to me that the gift was given,"
2115,II,"No greater joy have the Gods above,--"
2116,II,"That night of nights when my only lover,"
2117,II,"Though all reluctant, granted me love."
2118,II,
2119,II,"For thy beauty was mine, and my spirit knows it,"
2120,II,"Never, ah, never my heart forgets,"
2121,II,"One thing fixed, in the torrent of changing,"
2122,II,Faults and follies and fierce regrets.
2123,II,"Thine eyes and thy hair, that were lovely symbols"
2124,II,"Of that white soul that their grace enshrined,"
2125,II,"They are part of me and my life for ever,"
2126,II,In every fibre and cell entwined.
2127,II,
2128,II,Men might argue that having known thee
2129,II,"I had grown faithful and pure as thee,"
2130,II,Had turned at the touch of thy grace and glory
2131,II,From the average pathways trodden by me.
2132,II,Hadst thou been kinder or I been stronger
2133,II,It may be even these things had been--
2134,II,"But one thing is clear to my soul for ever,"
2135,II,I owe my owning of thee to sin.
2136,II,
2137,II,"Had I been colder I had not reached thee,"
2138,II,"Besmirched the ermine, beflecked the snow--"
2139,II,It was only sheer and desperate passion
2140,II,That won thy beauty in years ago.
2141,II,"And not for the highest virtues in Heaven,"
2142,II,"The utmost grace that the soul can name,"
2143,II,"Would I resign what the sin has brought me,"
2144,II,"Which I hold glory, and thou--thy shame."
2145,II,
2146,II,"I talk of sin in the usual fashion,"
2147,II,But God knows what is a sin to me--
2148,II,We love more fiercely or love more faintly--
2149,II,But I doubt if it matters how these things be.
2150,II,The best and the worst of us all sink under--
2151,II,What I held passion and thou held’st lust--
2152,II,"What name will it find in a few more seasons,"
2153,II,When we both dissolve in an equal dust?
2154,II,
2155,II,"If a God there be, and a God seems needed"
2156,II,"To make the beauty of things like thee,"
2157,II,"He doubtless also, some careless moment,"
2158,II,Mixed the forces that fashioned me.
2159,II,"Also He, for His own good reason--"
2160,II,Though I care little how these things are--
2161,II,"Gave me thee, in those few brief midnights,"
2162,II,And that one solace He never can mar.
2163,II,
2164,II,"Ah me, the stars of such varying heavens"
2165,II,"Have watched me, under such alien skies,"
2166,II,Lay thy beauty naked before me
2167,II,To soothe and solace my world-worn eyes.
2168,II,For one good gift to me has been given--
2169,II,"A memory accurate, clear and keen,"
2170,II,"That holds the vision, perfect for ever"
2171,II,"In charm and glory, of things once seen."
2172,II,
2173,II,"So I hold thee there, and my fancy wanders"
2174,II,"To each known beauty and blue-veined place,"
2175,II,"I know how each separate eyelash trembles,"
2176,II,And every shadow that sweeps thy face.
2177,II,"And this is a joy of which none can rob me,"
2178,II,This is a pleasure that none can mar--
2179,II,"As sweet as thou wert, in that long past midnight,"
2180,II,Even as lovely my memories are.
2181,II,
2182,II,"Ah, unforgotten and only lover,"
2183,II,"If ever I drift across thy thought,"
2184,II,"As even a vision unloved, unlovely,"
2185,II,"May cross the fancy, uncalled, unsought,"
2186,II,"When the years that pass thee have shown, in passing,"
2187,II,"That my love, _in its strength at least_, was rare--"
2188,II,"Wilt thou not think--ah, hope of the hopeless--"
2189,II,"E’en as thou wouldst not, thou wilt not--care!"
2190,II,
2191,II,
2192,II,Early Love
2193,II,
2194,II,
2195,II,"Who says I wrong thee, my half-opened rose?"
2196,II,"Little he knows of thee or me, or love.--"
2197,II,"I am so tender of thy fragile youth,"
2198,II,"Yea, in my hours of wildest ecstasy,"
2199,II,Keeping close-bitted each careering sense.
2200,II,Only I give mine eyes unmeasured law
2201,II,"To feed them where they will, and _their_ delight"
2202,II,"Was curbed at first, until thy tender shame"
2203,II,Died in the bearing of thy first born joy.
2204,II,
2205,II,"I am not cruel, my half-opened rose,"
2206,II,Though in the sunshine of my own desire
2207,II,I have uncurled thy petals to the light
2208,II,And fed the tendrils of thy dawning sense
2209,II,"With delicate caresses, till they leave"
2210,II,"Thee tremulous with the newness of thy joy,"
2211,II,Sharing thy lover’s fire with innocent flame.
2212,II,
2213,II,"Others will wrong thee, that I well foresee,"
2214,II,"Being a man, knowing my fellow men,"
2215,II,"And they who, knowing, would blame my love of thee"
2216,II,"Contentedly will see thy beauty given,"
2217,II,"When the world judges thou art ripe to wed,--"
2218,II,"To the rough rites of marriage, to the pain"
2219,II,"And grievous weariness of child-getting,--"
2220,II,This shall be right and licit in their eyes--
2221,II,"But it would break my heart, were I alive."
2222,II,
2223,II,"Yea, this will be; many will doubtless share"
2224,II,"The rose whose bud has been my one delight,"
2225,II,And I shall not be there to shield my flower.
2226,II,"Yet, I have taught thee of the ways of men,"
2227,II,"Much I have learnt in cities and in courts,"
2228,II,"Winnowed to suit thy tender brain,--is thine,"
2229,II,"Thus Life shall find thee, not all unprepared"
2230,II,"To face its callous, subtle cruelties."
2231,II,
2232,II,"Still,--it will profit little; I discern"
2233,II,"Thou art of those whose love will prove their curse,"
2234,II,"--Thou sayest thou lovest me, to thy delight?"
2235,II,"Nay, little one, it is not love as yet."
2236,II,"Dear as thou art, and lovely, thou canst not love,"
2237,II,Thy later loves shall show the truth of this.
2238,II,
2239,II,"Ay, by some subtle signs I know full well"
2240,II,That thou art capable of that great love
2241,II,"Whose glory has the light of unknown heavens,"
2242,II,And makes hot Hell for those who harbour it.
2243,II,
2244,II,"Naught I can say could save thee from thyself,"
2245,II,"Ah, were I half my age! Yet even that,"
2246,II,Had been too old for thy sweet thirteenth year.
2247,II,
2248,II,"Still, thou art happy now, and glad thine eyes,"
2249,II,"When, as the lilac evening gains the sky,"
2250,II,"I lay thee, ’twixt thine own soft hair and me,"
2251,II,Kissing thy senses into soft delight.
2252,II,Ruffling the petals of my half-closed rose
2253,II,"With tender touches, and perpetual care"
2254,II,That no wild moment of mine own delight
2255,II,"Deep in the flower’s heart,--should set the fruit."
2256,II,
2257,II,"Ah, in the days to come, it well may be,"
2258,II,When thou shalt see thy beauty stained and torn
2259,II,"By the harsh sequel of some future love,"
2260,II,"Thy thoughts shall stray to thy first lover’s grave,"
2261,II,"And thou shalt murmur, “Ay, but that was love."
2262,II,They were most wrong who said he did me wrong.
2263,II,Only I was too young to understand.”
2264,II,
2265,II,
2266,II,Vayu the Wind
2267,II,
2268,II,
2269,II,"Ah, Wind, I have always loved thee"
2270,II,Since those far off nights
2271,II,When I lay beneath the vines
2272,II,"A prey to strange delights,"
2273,II,For among my tresses
2274,II,Thy soft caresses
2275,II,Were sweet as a lover’s to me.
2276,II,
2277,II,"Later thou grewest more wanton, or I more shy,"
2278,II,"And after the bath I drew my garments close,"
2279,II,Fearing thy soft persuasion amongst my hair
2280,II,When thou camest fresh with the scent of some ruffled rose.
2281,II,
2282,II,"Ah, Wind, thou hast lain with the Desert,"
2283,II,"I know her savour well,"
2284,II,And the spices wherewith she scents her breasts--
2285,II,She who has known such countless lovers
2286,II,Yet rarely borne a city among her sands--
2287,II,"Thou comest as one from a night of love,"
2288,II,"Thy breath is broken and hard,--"
2289,II,"Bringing echoes of lonely things,"
2290,II,"Vast and cruel, that the soft and golden sands"
2291,II,Buried beneath thin ripples so long ago.
2292,II,"Ah, Wind, thou hast given me lovely things,"
2293,II,"The scent of a thousand flowers,"
2294,II,"And the heavy perfume of pollen-laden fields,"
2295,II,Strange snatches of wild song from the heart of the dark Bazaar
2296,II,"That thrilled to my very core,"
2297,II,"Till I threw the sheet aside and rose to follow,--"
2298,II,"But whither, or what?"
2299,II,
2300,II,"Also, Wind, thou broughtest the breath of the sea,"
2301,II,The sound of its myriad waves.
2302,II,And in nights when I lay on the lonely sands
2303,II,"Stretching mine arms to thee,"
2304,II,"Thou gavest me something--faint and vast and sweet,"
2305,II,"Something ineffable, wistful, from far away,"
2306,II,Elsewhere--Beyond--
2307,II,
2308,II,"And thou wast kind to me in my times of love,"
2309,II,Cooling my lips
2310,II,"That my lover wore away,"
2311,II,"While, wafting the scent from his divided hair,"
2312,II,Thou show’dst the stars between
2313,II,"Far away, and eclipsed by his burning eyes"
2314,II,Even the stars.
2315,II,
2316,II,And now I almost foresee the place and the hour
2317,II,When I shall open my dying lips to thee
2318,II,And receive a last cool kiss.
2319,II,"Afterwards, Wind, since I have always loved thee,--"
2320,II,"Whirl my dust to the scented heart of a moghra flower,"
2321,II,"_His_ flower, but, ah, thou knowest,--"
2322,II,So often thy kisses have mingled with his and mine.
