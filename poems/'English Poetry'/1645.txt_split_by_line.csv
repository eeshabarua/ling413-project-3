168,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And one mist wreath for canopy.
169,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
170,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Like torches on a marble floor
171,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Reflected, so the wild stars shone,"
172,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Within the abysmal hyaline,"
173,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Till the day widened more and more,"
174,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"And sank to sunset, and was gone,"
175,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"And then, as burning beacons shine"
176,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"On summits of a mountain isle,"
177,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"A light to folk on sea that fare,"
178,A DREAM IN JUNE.,So the sky’s beacons for a while
179,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Burned in these islands of the air.
180,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
181,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Then from a starry island set
182,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Where one swift tide of wind there flows,"
183,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Came scent of lily and violet,"
184,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Narcissus, hyacinth, and rose,"
185,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Laurel, and myrtle buds, and vine,"
186,A DREAM IN JUNE.,So delicate is the air and fine:
187,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And forests of all fragrant trees
188,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Sloped seaward from the central hill,"
189,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And ever clamorous were these
190,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
191,A DREAM IN JUNE.,With singing of glad birds; and still
192,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Such music came as in the woods
193,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Most lonely, consecrate to Pan,"
194,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"The Wind makes, in his many moods,"
195,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Upon the pipes some shepherd Man,"
196,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Hangs up, in thanks for victory!"
197,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"On these shall mortals play no more,"
198,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"But the Wind doth touch them, over and o’er,"
199,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And the Wind’s breath in the reeds will sigh.
200,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
201,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Between the daylight and the dark
202,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"That island lies in silver air,"
203,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And suddenly my magic barque
204,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Wheeled, and ran in, and grounded there;"
205,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And by me stood the sentinel
206,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Of them who in the island dwell;
207,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"All smiling did he bind my hands,"
208,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"With rushes green and rosy bands,"
209,A DREAM IN JUNE.,They have no harsher bonds than these
210,A DREAM IN JUNE.,The people of the pleasant lands
211,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Within the wash of the airy seas!
212,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
213,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Then was I to their city led:
214,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Now all of ivory and gold
215,A DREAM IN JUNE.,The great walls were that garlanded
216,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"The temples in their shining fold,"
217,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"(Each fane of beryl built, and each"
218,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Girt with its grove of shadowy beech,)"
219,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"And all about the town, and through,"
220,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"There flowed a River fed with dew,"
221,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"As sweet as roses, and as clear"
222,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"As mountain crystals pure and cold,"
223,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And with his waves that water kissed
224,A DREAM IN JUNE.,The gleaming altars of amethyst
225,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"That smoke with victims all the year,"
226,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And sacred are to the Gods of old.
227,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
228,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"There sat three Judges by the Gate,"
229,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"And I was led before the Three,"
230,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"And they but looked on me, and straight"
231,A DREAM IN JUNE.,The rosy bonds fell down from me
232,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Who, being innocent, was free;"
233,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And I might wander at my will
234,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"About that City on the hill,"
235,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Among the happy people clad
236,A DREAM IN JUNE.,In purple weeds of woven air
237,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Hued like the webs that Twilight weaves
238,A DREAM IN JUNE.,At shut of languid summer eves
239,A DREAM IN JUNE.,So light their raiment seemed; and glad
240,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Was every face I looked on there!
241,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
242,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"There was no heavy heat, no cold,"
243,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"The dwellers there wax never old,"
244,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Nor wither with the waning time,"
245,A DREAM IN JUNE.,But each man keeps that age he had
246,A DREAM IN JUNE.,When first he won the fairy clime.
247,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"The Night falls never from on high,"
248,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Nor ever burns the heat of noon.
249,A DREAM IN JUNE.,But such soft light eternally
250,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Shines, as in silver dawns of June"
251,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Before the Sun hath climbed the sky!
252,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
253,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Within these pleasant streets and wide,"
254,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"The souls of Heroes go and come,"
255,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Even they that fell on either side
256,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Beneath the walls of Ilium;
257,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And sunlike in that shadowy isle
258,A DREAM IN JUNE.,The face of Helen and her smile
259,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Makes glad the souls of them that knew
260,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Grief for her sake a little while!
261,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And all true Greeks and wise are there;
262,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And with his hand upon the hair
263,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Of Phaedo, saw I Socrates,"
264,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"About him many youths and fair,"
265,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Hylas, Narcissus, and with these"
266,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Him whom the quoit of Phoebus slew
267,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"By fleet Eurotas, unaware!"
268,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
269,A DREAM IN JUNE.,All these their mirth and pleasure made
270,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Within the plain Elysian,"
271,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"The fairest meadow that may be,"
272,A DREAM IN JUNE.,With all green fragrant trees for shade
273,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"And every scented wind to fan,"
274,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And sweetest flowers to strew the lea;
275,A DREAM IN JUNE.,The soft Winds are their servants fleet
276,A DREAM IN JUNE.,To fetch them every fruit at will
277,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And water from the river chill;
278,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And every bird that singeth sweet
279,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Throstle, and merle, and nightingale"
280,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Brings blossoms from the dewy vale,—"
281,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Lily, and rose, and asphodel—"
282,A DREAM IN JUNE.,With these doth each guest twine his crown
283,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"And wreathe his cup, and lay him down"
284,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Beside some friend he loveth well.
285,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
286,A DREAM IN JUNE.,There with the shining Souls I lay
287,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"When, lo, a Voice that seemed to say,"
288,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"In far-off haunts of Memory,"
289,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"_Whoso death taste the Dead Men’s bread_,"
290,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"_Shall dwell for ever with these Dead_,"
291,A DREAM IN JUNE.,_Nor ever shall his body lie_
292,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"_Beside his friends_, _on the grey hill_"
293,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"_Where rains weep_, _and the curlews shrill_"
294,A DREAM IN JUNE.,_And the brown water wanders by_!
295,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
296,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Then did a new soul in me wake,"
297,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"The dead men’s bread I feared to break,"
298,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Their fruit I would not taste indeed
299,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Were it but a pomegranate seed.
300,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Nay, not with these I made my choice"
301,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"To dwell for ever and rejoice,"
302,A DREAM IN JUNE.,For otherwhere the River rolls
303,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"That girds the home of Christian souls,"
304,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And these my whole heart seeks are found
305,A DREAM IN JUNE.,On otherwise enchanted ground.
306,A DREAM IN JUNE.,
307,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Even so I put the cup away,"
308,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"The vision wavered, dimmed, and broke,"
309,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"And, nowise sorrowing, I woke"
310,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"While, grey among the ruins grey"
311,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Chill through the dwellings of the dead,"
312,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"The Dawn crept o’er the Northern sea,"
313,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Then, in a moment, flushed to red,"
314,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Flushed all the broken minster old,"
315,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"And turned the shattered stones to gold,"

2390,NOTES.,of a passage in the _Vera Historia_ of Lucian.  The humorist was unable
2391,NOTES.,"to resist the temptation to introduce passages of mockery, which are here"
2392,NOTES.,omitted.  Part of his description of the Isles of the Blest has a close
2393,NOTES.,and singular resemblance to the New Jerusalem of the Apocalypse.  The
2394,NOTES.,clear River of Life and the prodigality of gold and of precious stones
2395,NOTES.,may especially be noticed.
2396,NOTES.,
2397,NOTES.,"_Whoso doth taste the Dead Men’s bread_, &.c.  This belief that the"
2398,NOTES.,"living may visit, on occasion, the dwellings of the dead, but can never"
2399,NOTES.,"return to earth if they taste the food of the departed, is expressed in"
2400,NOTES.,"myths of worldwide distribution.  Because she ate the pomegranate seed,"
2401,NOTES.,"Persephone became subject to the spell of Hades.  In Apuleius, Psyche,"
2402,NOTES.,"when she visits the place of souls, is advised to abstain from food."
2403,NOTES.,"Kohl found the myth among the Ojibbeways, Mr. Codrington among the"
2404,NOTES.,"Solomon Islanders; it occurs in Samoa, in the Finnish Kalewala (where"
2405,NOTES.,"Wainamoinen, in Pohjola, refrains from touching meat or drink), and the"
2406,NOTES.,belief has left its mark on the mediæval ballad of Thomas of Ercildoune.
2407,NOTES.,"When he is in Fairy Land, the Fairy Queen supplies him with the bread and"
2408,NOTES.,"wine of earth, and will not suffer him to touch the fruits which grow “in"
2409,NOTES.,this countrie.”  See also “Wandering Willie” in Redgauntlet.
2410,NOTES.,
2411,NOTES.,Page 20.  _As now the hutted Eskimo_.  The Eskimo and the miserable
2412,NOTES.,Fuegians are almost the only Socialists who practise what European
2413,NOTES.,Anarchists preach.  The Fuegians go so far as to tear up any piece of
2414,NOTES.,"cloth which one of the tribe may receive, so that each member may have a"
2415,NOTES.,"rag.  The Eskimo are scarcely such consistent walkers, and canoes show a"
2416,NOTES.,tendency to accumulate in the hands of proprietors.  Formerly no Eskimo
2417,NOTES.,was allowed to possess more than one canoe.  Such was the wild justice of
2418,NOTES.,the Polar philosophers.
2419,NOTES.,
2420,NOTES.,Page 36.  _The latest minstrel_.  “The sound of all others dearest to his
2421,NOTES.,"ear, the gentle ripple of Tweed over its pebbles, was distinctly audible"
2422,NOTES.,as we knelt around the bed and his eldest son kissed and closed his
2423,NOTES.,"eyes.”—Lockhart’s Life of Scott, vii., 394."
2424,NOTES.,
2425,NOTES.,Page 45.  _Ronsard’s Grave_.  This version ventures to condense the
2426,NOTES.,"original which, like most of the works of the Pleiad, is unnecessarily"
2427,NOTES.,long.
2428,NOTES.,
2429,NOTES.,"Page 46.  _The snow_, _and wind_, _and hail_.  Ronsard’s rendering of the"
2430,NOTES.,"famous passage in Odyssey, vi., about the dwellings of the Olympians."
2431,NOTES.,The vision of a Paradise of learned lovers and poets constantly recurs in
2432,NOTES.,"the poetry of Joachim du Bellay, and of Ronsard."
2433,NOTES.,
2434,NOTES.,"Page 50.  _Romance_.  Suggested by a passage in La Faustin, by M. E. de"
2435,NOTES.,"Goncourt, a curious moment of poetry in a repulsive piece of"
2436,NOTES.,_naturalisme_.
2437,NOTES.,
2438,NOTES.,"Page 55.  _M. Boulmier_, author of _Les Villanelles_, died shortly after"
2439,NOTES.,this villanelle was written; he had not published a larger collection on

2441,NOTES.,
2442,NOTES.,Page 61.  _Edmund Gorliot_.  The bibliophile will not easily procure
2443,NOTES.,"Gorliot’s book, which is not in the catalogues.  Throughout _The Last"
2444,NOTES.,Maying_ there is reference to the _Pervigilium Veneris_.
2445,NOTES.,
2446,NOTES.,"Page 105.  _Bird-Gods_.  Apparently Aristophanes preserved, in a"
2447,NOTES.,"burlesque form, the remnants of a genuine myth.  Almost all savage"
2448,NOTES.,"religions have their bird-gods, and it is probable that Aristophanes did"
2449,NOTES.,"not invent, but only used a surviving myth of which there are scarcely"
2450,NOTES.,any other traces in Greek literature.
2451,NOTES.,
2452,NOTES.,"Page 134.  _Spinet_.  The accent is on the last foot, even when the word"
