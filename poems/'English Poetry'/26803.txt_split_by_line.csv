26,KING HACON’S DEATH,KING HACON’S DEATH
27,KING HACON’S DEATH,
28,KING HACON’S DEATH,
29,KING HACON’S DEATH,And now has happened in our day
30,KING HACON’S DEATH,What was in ancient time foretold:
31,KING HACON’S DEATH,Beneath his hand all Norroway’s land
32,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Has Hacon brought, the wise and bold."
33,KING HACON’S DEATH,
34,KING HACON’S DEATH,Full many a warrior summons he
35,KING HACON’S DEATH,From all the country far and near;
36,KING HACON’S DEATH,"To Scotland’s realm, with shield and helm,"
37,KING HACON’S DEATH,Across the sea the King will steer.
38,KING HACON’S DEATH,
39,KING HACON’S DEATH,As many as sword and helm can bear
40,KING HACON’S DEATH,With him must sail across the foam;
41,KING HACON’S DEATH,"All of fit age must follow their liege,"
42,KING HACON’S DEATH,Those who are not may tarry at home.
43,KING HACON’S DEATH,
44,KING HACON’S DEATH,"It was Hacon, Norroway’s King,"
45,KING HACON’S DEATH,Survey’d the gallant band with pride:
46,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“I’m missing one—my Andfindson,"
47,KING HACON’S DEATH,O where does Olaf the stripling bide?”
48,KING HACON’S DEATH,
49,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Then answer’d him the little footboy,"
50,KING HACON’S DEATH,Not far that stood from the Monarch’s knee:
51,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“Olaf, my Lord, will come on board"
52,KING HACON’S DEATH,As soon as weigh’d the anchors be.”
53,KING HACON’S DEATH,
54,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Then out they stood from Bergen town,"
55,KING HACON’S DEATH,"And out from Bergen’s mole, I trow;"
56,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Silk is the sail they spread in the gale,"
57,KING HACON’S DEATH,Painted with blue is the deck below.
58,KING HACON’S DEATH,
59,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“Now Magnus hear, my son so dear,"
60,KING HACON’S DEATH,At home I tell thee thou must stay:
61,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Aarhus to ward and Bergen to guard,"
62,KING HACON’S DEATH,For the keys of Norroway’s land are they.”
63,KING HACON’S DEATH,
64,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“Listen all dearest father mine,"
65,KING HACON’S DEATH,Recall thy word I entreat of thee;
66,KING HACON’S DEATH,To rule rough earls and Norroway churls
67,KING HACON’S DEATH,Too ignorant far and too young I be.”
68,KING HACON’S DEATH,
69,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“Then clothe thee straight and clothe thee well,"
70,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Since thou wilt follow me, my child:"
71,KING HACON’S DEATH,But much I fear thou can’st not bear
72,KING HACON’S DEATH,The toss of the sea and its billows wild.”
73,KING HACON’S DEATH,
74,KING HACON’S DEATH,"So out they stood from Bergen town,"
75,KING HACON’S DEATH,And ’twas at fall of evening grey;
76,KING HACON’S DEATH,The folk on the shore they griev’d full sore
77,KING HACON’S DEATH,As that brave armament sail’d away.
78,KING HACON’S DEATH,
79,KING HACON’S DEATH,"And when they came to Lindeness,"
80,KING HACON’S DEATH,"And the mounting billow the sail bespray’d,"
81,KING HACON’S DEATH,In the breeze so fair the ship stood there
82,KING HACON’S DEATH,As though to the bottom it fast were made.
83,KING HACON’S DEATH,
84,KING HACON’S DEATH,Then said the King as he lean’d upon
85,KING HACON’S DEATH,His trusty faulchion’s hilt of gold:
86,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“I’m here in the dark, is there any clerk"
87,KING HACON’S DEATH,Or layman here can this thing unfold?”
88,KING HACON’S DEATH,
89,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Then out spoke Nilaus Noderness,"
90,KING HACON’S DEATH,As a glance he flung upon the deep:
91,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“Doom’d men on board, have we my Lord,"
92,KING HACON’S DEATH,The truth from thee I cannot keep.”
93,KING HACON’S DEATH,
94,KING HACON’S DEATH,It was our Norroway Hacon then
95,KING HACON’S DEATH,Thereat so sorely troubled grew:
96,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“I’m missing one, my Andfindson,"
97,KING HACON’S DEATH,Why meets not Olaf his father’s view?”
98,KING HACON’S DEATH,
99,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Then answer’d him the little footboy,"
100,KING HACON’S DEATH,As apart he stood from the Norway King:
101,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“Beneath the deck lies Olaf sick,"
102,KING HACON’S DEATH,And much I fear he’s suffering.”
103,KING HACON’S DEATH,
104,KING HACON’S DEATH,It was Hacon the Norway King
105,KING HACON’S DEATH,To visit Olaf with speed he goes:
106,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“What cheer, what cheer, my Olaf dear?"
107,KING HACON’S DEATH,Thy state to thy father straight disclose.”
108,KING HACON’S DEATH,
109,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“I feel no rest within my breast,"
110,KING HACON’S DEATH,Methinks my very heart will rend:
111,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Would God, the King of all, would bring"
112,KING HACON’S DEATH,This horrible night to a speedy end.”
113,KING HACON’S DEATH,
114,KING HACON’S DEATH,"They watched o’er Olaf Andfindson,"
115,KING HACON’S DEATH,They watched o’er Olaf long nights twain;
116,KING HACON’S DEATH,"And Hacon I say, of Norroway,"
117,KING HACON’S DEATH,By watching thus his death did gain.
118,KING HACON’S DEATH,
119,KING HACON’S DEATH,"It was Olaf Andfindson,"
120,KING HACON’S DEATH,He yielded up his gentle sprite;
121,KING HACON’S DEATH,’Twas Hacon grey of Norroway
122,KING HACON’S DEATH,Before him held the big wax light.
123,KING HACON’S DEATH,
124,KING HACON’S DEATH,"O then King Hacon distrest he grew,"
125,KING HACON’S DEATH,The stripling’s corse he would not leave:
126,KING HACON’S DEATH,"He pin’d away and sick he lay,"
127,KING HACON’S DEATH,His hoary Counsellors how they grieve.
128,KING HACON’S DEATH,
129,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“Cheer up,” they said.  “We’ve fought and bled,"
130,KING HACON’S DEATH,And almost won these foreign shores;
131,KING HACON’S DEATH,But if thou now from us should’st go
132,KING HACON’S DEATH,A sad and dreary fate were ours.”
133,KING HACON’S DEATH,
134,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“My time is come, I can’t survive;"
135,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Write ye my testament, I pray,"
136,KING HACON’S DEATH,When I am gone do ye see done
137,KING HACON’S DEATH,What with my dying breath I say:
138,KING HACON’S DEATH,
139,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“My son, King Magnus, I advise"
140,KING HACON’S DEATH,Ever the law of God to heed;
141,KING HACON’S DEATH,"Justice above all things to love,"
142,KING HACON’S DEATH,"And well, full well, with him ’twill speed."
143,KING HACON’S DEATH,
144,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“Priests and widows let him defend,"
145,KING HACON’S DEATH,"And his reign, I trow, will not be brief;"
146,KING HACON’S DEATH,"The outlaw crew let him pursue,"
147,KING HACON’S DEATH,And hang unpitying every thief.
148,KING HACON’S DEATH,
149,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“These are the first things I request,"
150,KING HACON’S DEATH,And now I’ll crave another thing;
151,KING HACON’S DEATH,Ye’ll bury me with my ancestry
152,KING HACON’S DEATH,In our Lady’s Church as beseems your King.”
153,KING HACON’S DEATH,
154,KING HACON’S DEATH,To Bergen’s shore came tidings o’er
155,KING HACON’S DEATH,Which made the hearts of the dauntless faint:
156,KING HACON’S DEATH,"“Hacon is dead, our regal head,"
157,KING HACON’S DEATH,Relation near to Olaf Saint.”
158,KING HACON’S DEATH,
159,KING HACON’S DEATH,"In Orkney isle expir’d the King,"
160,KING HACON’S DEATH,On a Thursday morning that befell;
161,KING HACON’S DEATH,"’Twas Pentecost when the King they lost,"
162,KING HACON’S DEATH,The mighty King whom they lov’d so well.
163,KING HACON’S DEATH,
164,KING HACON’S DEATH,"From high Kirkwall now sail’d they all,"
165,KING HACON’S DEATH,And to Bergen o’er their course they ply;
166,KING HACON’S DEATH,"They laid in grave the Monarch brave,"
167,KING HACON’S DEATH,In the spot where the Monarch wish’d to lie.
168,KING HACON’S DEATH,
169,KING HACON’S DEATH,"A braver heart ne’er play’d a part,"
170,KING HACON’S DEATH,And never shone in Minstrel’s lay;
171,KING HACON’S DEATH,No King on earth can vie in worth
172,KING HACON’S DEATH,With Hacon the Good of Norroway.

177,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG
178,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
179,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
180,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,The day we went to the hills to chase
181,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Of dogs we had a brave company;
182,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"There heard we the songs of the feather’d race,"
183,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"The blare of the elk, and the roebuck’s cry."
184,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
185,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"In the hills we had no common sport,"
186,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,With our dogs and our arms many deer we slew;
187,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"When at noon we return’d to our silvan court,"
188,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"We were a well-pleas’d, laughing crew."
189,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
190,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,That night the house of the Fenian king
191,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,With a band of joyous guests was fill’d;
192,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"The manner we sang, whilst we plied the string,"
193,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,In which the buck and the elk we kill’d.
194,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
195,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"The valiant Finn arose next day,"
196,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Just as the sun rose above the foam;
197,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"And he beheld up the Lairgo way,"
198,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,A man clad in red with a black dog come.
199,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
200,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,I’ll tell ye what was the stranger’s mien:
201,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,His complexion was that of the strawberrie;
202,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"White as the canach was his skin,"
203,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"Though black his hair, as black could be."
204,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
205,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"He came up with a lofty gait,"
206,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Said not for shelter he sought our doors;
207,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"And wanted neither drink nor meat,"
208,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,But would match his dog ’gainst the best of ours.
209,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
210,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,We brought ’gainst that of the stranger youth
211,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,The very best dogs within our bounds;
212,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"But the stranger dog had a desperate tooth,"
213,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,And quickly despatch’d for us fifty hounds.
214,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
215,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"A strange fight this, the great Finn said,"
216,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,As he turn’d his face towards his clan;
217,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"Then his face with rage grey fiery red,"
218,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,And he struck with his fist his good dog Bran.
219,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
220,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"Bran look’d at his master with much surprise,"
221,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,That his master should strike him surprise he felt—
222,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"“I could hew from the shoulder the hand,” Finn cries,"
223,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,“With which my dog that blow I dealt.”
224,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
225,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"Then Bran he shook his collar of gold,"
226,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,The mountains echoed with his bay;
227,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"His terrible eyes like fire-balls roll’d,"
228,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,And his mind was bent upon canine fray.
229,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
230,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"“Take off from his neck the collar of gold,"
231,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Not right for him now such a thing to bear;
232,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,And a free good fight we shall behold
233,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Betwixt my dog and his black compeer.”
234,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
235,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Now a likeness I’ll draw of my good dog Bran:
236,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"His head was cover’d with shaggy hair,"
237,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"His breast was broad and its colour tan,"
238,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"His houghs were crook’d, his quarters square."
239,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
240,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"Four yellow feet had he I ween,"
241,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,His sides were black but his belly fair;
242,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"A tinge of green on his back was seen,"
243,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Of blood-red ears he’d a pointed pair.
244,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
245,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"The dogs their noses together placed,"
246,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Then their blood was scatter’d on every side;
247,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"Desperate the fight, and the fight did last"
248,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,’Till the brave black dog in Bran’s gripe died.
249,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
250,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"“O sure was I,” did Ossian cry,"
251,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"From the pillar of the dogs with stern delight,"
252,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,“There was no dog in the Finn country
253,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Could inflict upon Bran the mortal bite.
254,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
255,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"“O Bran was a stag-hound Morong bred,"
256,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,And possess’d each canine guile and sleight;
257,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,There was no dog in leash e’er led
258,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Could consign our dog to the Western height.
259,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
260,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"“There’s many a damsel, heavenly bright,"
261,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"With azure eye and yellow hair,"
262,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,In the land of the son of King Torc this night
263,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Would be proud with my dog her supper to share.”
264,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
265,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,A grave the valiant hero made
266,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,For his good black dog in the field’s green breast;
267,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Full fifty dogs the Fenians laid
268,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,To the pibroch’s blast in the hill to the west.
269,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,
270,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"We went to the dwelling of high MacCuol,"
271,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"With the king to drink, and dice, and throw;"
272,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,"The king was joyous, his hall was full,"
273,BRAN AND THE BLACK DOG,Though empty and dark this night I trow.
