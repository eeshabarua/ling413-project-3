29,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
30,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
31,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","I know where stands a Castellaye,"
32,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Its turrets are so fairly gilt;
33,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","With silver are its gates inlaid,"
34,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Its walls of marble stone are built.
35,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
36,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Within it stands a linden tree,"
37,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","With lovely leaves its boughs are hung,"
38,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Therein doth dwell a nightingale,"
39,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",And sweetly moves that bird its tongue.
40,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
41,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","A gallant knight came riding by,"
42,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",He heard its dulcet ditty ring;
43,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","And sorely, sorely, wondered he"
44,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",At midnight hour that it should sing.
45,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
46,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""And hear, thou little Nightingale,"
47,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","If thou to me wilt sing a lay,"
48,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Thy feathers I'll with gold bedeck,"
49,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Thy neck with costly pearls array."""
50,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
51,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""With golden feathers others lure,"
52,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Such gifts for me have value slight;
53,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","I am a strange and lonely bird,"
54,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","But little known to mortal wight."""
55,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
56,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""And thou, a strange wild bird thou be,"
57,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Whom other mortals little know;
58,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Yet hunger pinches thee, and cold,"
59,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","When falls the cruel winter snow."""
60,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
61,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""I laugh at hunger, laugh at snow,"
62,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Which falls so wide on hill and lea;
63,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","But I am vexed by secret care,"
64,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",I know not either joy or glee.
65,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
66,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""Betwixt the hills and valleys deep"
67,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Away the rapid rivers flow;
68,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",But ah! remembrance of true love
69,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",From out the mind will never go.
70,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
71,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""O I had once a handsome love,"
72,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",A famous knight of valour he;
73,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","But ah! my step-dame all o'erturn'd,"
74,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",She vowed our marriage ne'er should be.
75,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
76,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""She changed me to a Nightingale,"
77,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Bade me around the world to fly;
78,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","My Brother she changed to a wolf so gray,"
79,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Bade him into the forest hie.
80,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
81,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""She told him, as the wood he sought,"
82,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","That he should win his shape no more,"
83,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","'Till he had drunk her heart's blood out,"
84,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",And that befell when years were o'er.
85,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
86,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""It happened on a summer tide,"
87,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Amidst the wood she wandered gay,"
88,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","My brother saw and watched her close,"
89,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",From 'neath the bushes where he lay.
90,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
91,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""He seized her quickly by the foot,"
92,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",All with his laidly wolfish claw;
93,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Tore out her heart, and drank her blood,"
94,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",And thus released himself he saw.
95,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
96,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""Yet I am still a little bird,"
97,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",And o'er the verdant meads I fly;
98,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","So sorrowful I pass my life,"
99,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",But mostly 'neath the winter's sky.
100,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
101,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""But God be thanked, he me has waked,"
102,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",And speech from him my tongue has won;
103,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",For fifteen years I have not spoke
104,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","As I with thee, Sir Knight, have done."
105,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
106,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""But ever with a mournful voice,"
107,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Have sung the green wood bough upon;
108,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",And had no better dwelling place
109,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Than gloomy forests, sad and lone."""
110,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
111,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""Now hear, thou little Nightingale,"
112,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","This simple thing would I propose,"
113,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","In winter sit within my bower,"
114,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","And hie thee forth when summer blows."""
115,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
116,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""O many thanks, thou handsome knight"
117,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Thy offer would I accept full fane;
118,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","But ah, my step-dame that forbade"
119,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Whilst still in feather I remain."""
120,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
121,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","The Nightingale sat musing deep,"
122,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Unto the knight she paid no heed,"
123,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Until he seized her by the foot,"
124,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",For God I ween had so decreed.
125,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
126,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","He carried her to his chamber in,"
127,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",The doors and windows fast he made;
128,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Then changed she to the strangest beasts
129,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",That ever mortal eye survey'd.
130,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
131,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","A lion now, and now a bear,"
132,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",And now a coil of hissing snakes;
133,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","At last a Dragon she became,"
134,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",And furious she the knight attacks.
135,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
136,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","He cut her with a little knife,"
137,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",So that her blood did stain the floor;
138,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",Then straight before his eye there stood
139,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",A Damsel bright as any flower.
140,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
141,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""Now, Damsel fair, I've rescued thee"
142,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",From thraldom drear and secret care;
143,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Now tell me of thy ancestry,"
144,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Thy parents and thy race declare."""
145,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
146,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""My father he was England's King,"
147,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",My mother was his lovely Queen;
148,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","My brother once a grey wolf was,"
149,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","And trotted o'er the wold so green."""
150,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
151,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","""If England's King thy father was,"
152,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","And thy dear mother England's Queen,"
153,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Thou art my sister's daughter then,"
154,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","Who long a Nightingale has been."""
155,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",
156,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","O there was joy throughout the land,"
157,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",And all the court was filled with glee;
158,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL","The Knight has caught the Nightingale,"
159,"THE NIGHTINGALE, OR THE TRANSFORMED DAMSEL",That dwelt within the linden tree.

172,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"A discourse which I heard,"
173,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,Betwixt a bright maiden
174,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,And black raven bird.
175,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,
176,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,The Valkyrie's vext
177,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,No war-field to find;
178,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,The speech she knew well
179,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"Of the wild feather'd kind,"
180,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,And thus she bespake him
181,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"Who bears the brown bill,"
182,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,So proud as he perch'd on
183,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,The peak of the hill.
184,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,
185,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"""What do you here, ravens,"
186,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"And whence come ye, say,"
187,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,Your heads turn'd direct to
188,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,The dying sun's ray?
189,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,Bits of flesh hold your claws--
190,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,There's blood flowing free
191,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"From your beaks, surely nigh"
192,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"Dead bodies there be."""
193,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,
194,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"Then wiping his beak,"
195,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"Bloody red, on the rock,"
196,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,The eagle's sworn brother
197,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,Thus answer'd and spoke:
198,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"""Harald we've follow'd,"

203,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"""Then ye know, bird, the king,"
204,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"Whose keep is in Kvine,"
205,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,The young king--the Norse king--
206,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,Whose keels cut the brine;

215,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"The wild game of Frey,"
216,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,Of the warmth of the hearth
217,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,He weary is grown;
218,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,He loathes the close chamber
219,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,And cushions of down.
220,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,
221,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"""Heard ye not the hard fight"
222,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"Near Hafirsfirth beach,"
223,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,'Twixt the king of high kindred
224,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,And Kotva the rich?

226,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,Prepared for war stern;
227,THE VALKYRIE AND RAVEN,"Their dragon heads gaped,"

387,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
388,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,Early at morn the lark sang gay--
389,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,(_All underneath so green a hill_)
390,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,Sir Carl by his bed put on his array--
391,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,(_The Danish King will 'venge his fill_).
392,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
393,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"He drew on his shirt as white as milk,"
394,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,Then his doublet foisted with verdant silk.
395,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
396,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"His legs in his buckskin boots he placed,"
397,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,And around them his gilded spurs he braced.
398,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
399,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"His gilded spurs there around he braced,"
400,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,And away to the Ting he rode in haste.
401,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
402,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"Sir Carl he galloped along the way,"
403,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,Such wondrous things he proved that day.
404,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
405,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"Sir Carl he galloped up to the Ting,"
406,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,The crowd before him scattering.
407,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
408,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,To warriors nine the Dane-king cries:
409,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""Bind ye Sir Carl before my eyes."""
410,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
411,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"Up then amain the nine warriors rise,"
412,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,They bound Sir Carl 'fore their sovereign's eyes.
413,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
414,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"And out from the town Sir Carl they convey'd,"
415,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,And upon a new wheel his body laid.
416,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
417,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,To Sir Plog then quickly a messenger came:
418,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""The Dane-king has broken thy brother's frame."""
419,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
420,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"Sir Plog he sprang o'er the wide, wide board,"
421,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,But returned in answer no single word.
422,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
423,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,In his buckskin boots his shanks he cased
424,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,And around his gilded spurs he braced.
425,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
426,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"His gilded spurs there around he tied,"
427,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,And away to the Ting the noble hied.
428,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
429,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"And fast and furious was his course,"
430,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,So leapt and bounded his gallant horse.
431,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
432,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"Up, up to the Ting Sir Plog he goes,"
433,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,And up to receive him the Dane-king rose.
434,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
435,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""If I had been earlier here to-day,"
436,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,Then things had turned out in a better way.
437,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
438,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""My brother is wheeled though he did no wrong,"
439,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"That deed, Dane-king, thou shalt rue ere long."
440,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
441,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""If four hours sooner I had but come,"
442,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"My brother, for certain, had followed me home."
443,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
444,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""Deprived of his life doth my brother lie,"
445,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"Dane-king, thou hast lost thine honour thereby."""
446,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
447,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,The Dane-king so fitting an answer returned:
448,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""Thy brother full richly his death had earned."
449,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
450,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""When the great with sword can oppress the mean"
451,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"The law is not worth a rotten bean."""
452,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
453,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""My brother, Sir King, was good and bold,"
454,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"I could have redeemed him with silver and gold."""
455,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
456,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""Thy silver and gold I hold at nought,"
457,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,The law shall have the course it ought.
458,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
459,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""And since thou so long on this matter doth prate,"
460,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"Thou shalt suffer the very same fate."""
461,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
462,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,To warriors nine the Dane-king cries:
463,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""Bind ye Sir Plog before my eyes."""
464,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
465,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"""If a truly brave man, Dane-king, thou be,"
466,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"Do thou thyself bind and fetter me."""
467,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
468,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"The King off his hands the little gloves took,"
469,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,Sir Plog his spear with vehemence shook.
470,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
471,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"He first slew four, then five he slew,"
472,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,And the Dane-king himself with his warriors true.
473,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
474,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"When all the King's men he dead had laid,"
475,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,His gallant brother he home convey'd.
476,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
477,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"To Ribe the royal corse they bear,"
478,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,Where it rests 'neath a tomb of marble fair.
479,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,
480,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,"But Sir Plog he went to a foreign shore,"
481,ERIK EMUN AND SIR PLOG,No word they heard of him evermore.

499,THE ELVES,"The bridegroom found, with fear and dread,"
500,THE ELVES,"That he a rough oak stump embrac'd,"
501,THE ELVES,Instead of woman's lovely waist.
502,THE ELVES,"Then, to increase his fear and wonder,"
503,THE ELVES,There sang a voice his window under:
504,THE ELVES,
505,THE ELVES,"""Come out to her whom thou didst wed,"
