45,--THOMAS TUSSER.,--THOMAS TUSSER.
46,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
47,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"It came without warning, at the very hour his hand was outstretched to"
48,--THOMAS TUSSER.,crumple the Holz and Gunsberg Combine. The New York doctors called it
49,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"overwork, and he lay in a darkened room, one ankle crossed above"
50,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the other, tongue pressed into palate, wondering whether the next"
51,--THOMAS TUSSER.,brain-surge of prickly fires would drive his soul from all anchorages.
52,--THOMAS TUSSER.,At last they gave judgment. With care he might in two years return to
53,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the arena, but for the present he must go across the water and do no"
54,--THOMAS TUSSER.,work whatever. He accepted the terms. It was capitulation; but the
55,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Combine that had shivered beneath his knife gave him all the honours
56,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of war: Gunsberg himself, full of condolences, came to the steamer and"
57,--THOMAS TUSSER.,filled the Chapins' suite of cabins with overwhelming flower-works.
58,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
59,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Smilax,” said George Chapin when he saw them. “Fitz is right. I'm dead;"
60,--THOMAS TUSSER.,only I don't see why he left out the 'In Memoriam' on the ribbons!”
61,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
62,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Nonsense!” his wife answered, and poured him his tincture. “You'll be"
63,--THOMAS TUSSER.,back before you can think.”
64,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
65,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"He looked at himself in the mirror, surprised that his face had not been"
66,--THOMAS TUSSER.,branded by the hells of the past three months. The noise of the decks
67,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"worried him, and he lay down, his tongue only a little pressed against"
68,--THOMAS TUSSER.,his palate.
69,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
70,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"An hour later he said: “Sophie, I feel sorry about taking you away from"
71,--THOMAS TUSSER.,everything like this. I--I suppose we're the two loneliest people on
72,--THOMAS TUSSER.,God's earth to-night.”
73,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
74,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Said Sophie his wife, and kissed him: “Isn't it something to you that"
75,--THOMAS TUSSER.,we're going together?”
76,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
77,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"They drifted about Europe for months--sometimes alone, sometimes with"
78,--THOMAS TUSSER.,chance met gipsies of their own land. From the North Cape to the Blue
79,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Grotto at Capri they wandered, because the next steamer headed that way,"
80,--THOMAS TUSSER.,or because some one had set them on the road. The doctors had warned
81,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Sophie that Chapin was not to take interest even in other men's
82,--THOMAS TUSSER.,interests; but a familiar sensation at the back of the neck after one
83,--THOMAS TUSSER.,hour's keen talk with a Nauheimed railway magnate saved her any trouble.
84,--THOMAS TUSSER.,He nearly wept.
85,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
86,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“And I'm over thirty,” he cried. “With all I meant to do!”"
87,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
88,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Let's call it a honeymoon,” said Sophie. “D' you know, in all the six"
89,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"years we've been married, you've never told me what you meant to do with"
90,--THOMAS TUSSER.,your life?”
91,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
92,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“With my life? What's the use? It's finished now.” Sophie looked up
93,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"quickly from the Bay of Naples. “As far as my business goes, I shall"
94,--THOMAS TUSSER.,have to live on my rents like that architect at San Moritz.”
95,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
96,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“You'll get better if you don't worry; and even if it takes time, there"
97,--THOMAS TUSSER.,are worse things than--How much have you?”
98,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
99,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Between four and five million. But it isn't the money. You know it
100,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"isn't. It's the principle. How could you respect me? You never did, the"
101,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"first year after we married, till I went to work like the others. Our"
102,--THOMAS TUSSER.,tradition and upbringing are against it. We can't accept those ideals.”
103,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
104,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Well, I suppose I married you for some sort of ideal,” she answered,"
105,--THOMAS TUSSER.,and they returned to their forty-third hotel.
106,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
107,--THOMAS TUSSER.,In England they missed the alien tongues of Continental streets that
108,--THOMAS TUSSER.,reminded them of their own polyglot cities. In England all men spoke one
109,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"tongue, speciously like American to the ear, but on cross-examination"
110,--THOMAS TUSSER.,unintelligible.
111,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
112,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Ah, but you have not seen England,” said a lady with iron-grey hair."
113,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"They had met her in Vienna, Bayreuth, and Florence, and were grateful"
114,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"to find her again at Claridge's, for she commanded situations, and knew"
115,--THOMAS TUSSER.,where prescriptions are most carefully made up. “You ought to take an
116,--THOMAS TUSSER.,interest in the home of our ancestors as I do.”
117,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
118,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I've tried for a week, Mrs. Shonts,” said Sophie, “but I never get any"
119,--THOMAS TUSSER.,further than tipping German waiters.”
120,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
121,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“These men are not the true type,” Mrs. Shouts went on. “I know where"
122,--THOMAS TUSSER.,you should go.”
123,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
124,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Chapin pricked up his ears, anxious to run anywhere from the streets"
125,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"on which quick men, something of his kidney, did the business denied to"
126,--THOMAS TUSSER.,him.
127,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
128,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“We hear and we obey, Mrs. Shonts,” said Sophie, feeling his unrest as"
129,--THOMAS TUSSER.,he drank the loathed British tea.
130,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
131,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Mrs. Shonts smiled, and took them in hand. She wrote widely and"
132,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"telegraphed far on their behalf till, armed with her letter of"
133,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"introduction, she drove them into that wilderness which is reached from"
134,--THOMAS TUSSER.,an ash-barrel of a station called Charing Cross. They were to go to
135,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Rockett's--the farm of one Cloke, in the southern counties--where, she"
136,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"assured them, they would meet the genuine England of folklore and song."
137,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
138,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Rocketts they found after some hours, four miles from a station, and,"
139,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"so far as they could judge in the bumpy darkness, twice as many from a"
140,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"road. Trees, kine, and the outlines of barns showed shadowy about them"
141,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"when they alighted, and Mr. and Mrs. Cloke, at the open door of a deep"
142,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"stone-floored kitchen, made them slowly welcome. They lay in an attic"
143,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"beneath a wavy whitewashed ceiling, and, because it rained, a wood fire"
144,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"was made in an iron basket on a brick hearth, and they fell asleep to"
145,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the chirping of mice and the whimper of flames.
146,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
147,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"When they woke it was a fair day, full of the noises, of birds, the"
148,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"smell of box lavender, and fried bacon, mixed with an elemental smell"
149,--THOMAS TUSSER.,they had never met before.
150,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
151,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“This,” said Sophie, nearly pushing out the thin casement in an attempt"
152,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"to see round the corner, “is--what did the hack-cabman say to the"
153,--THOMAS TUSSER.,railway porter about my trunk--'quite on the top?'”
154,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
155,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“No; 'a little bit of all right.' I feel farther away from anywhere than
156,--THOMAS TUSSER.,I've ever felt in my life. We must find out where the telegraph office
157,--THOMAS TUSSER.,is.”
158,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
159,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Who cares?” said Sophie, wandering about, hairbrush in hand, to admire"
160,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the illustrated weekly pictures pasted on door and cupboard.
161,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
162,--THOMAS TUSSER.,But there was no rest for the alien soul till he had made sure of the
163,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"telegraph office. He asked the Clokes' daughter, laying breakfast, while"
164,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Sophie plunged her face in the lavender bush outside the low window.
165,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
166,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Go to the stile a-top o' the Barn field,” said Mary, “and look across"
167,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Pardons to the next spire. It's directly under. You can't miss it--not
168,--THOMAS TUSSER.,if you keep to the footpath. My sister's the telegraphist there.
169,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"But you're in the three-mile radius, sir. The boy delivers telegrams"
170,--THOMAS TUSSER.,directly to this door from Pardons village.”
171,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
172,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“One has to take a good deal on trust in this country,” he murmured."
173,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
174,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Sophie looked at the close turf, scarred only with last night's wheels,"
175,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"at two ruts which wound round a rickyard, and at the circle of still"
176,--THOMAS TUSSER.,orchard about the half-timbered house.
177,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
178,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“What's the matter with it?” she said. “Telegrams delivered to the Vale
179,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of Avalon, of course,” and she beckoned in an earnest-eyed hound of"
180,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"engaging manners and no engagements, who answered, at times, to the name"
181,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of Rambler. He led them, after breakfast, to the rise behind the house"
182,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"where the stile stood against the skyline, and, “I wonder what we shall"
183,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"find now,” said Sophie, frankly prancing with joy on the grass."
184,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
185,--THOMAS TUSSER.,It was a slope of gap-hedged fields possessed to their centres by clumps
186,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of brambles. Gates were not, and the rabbit-mined, cattle-rubbed posts"
187,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"leaned out and in. A narrow path doubled among the bushes, scores of"
188,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"white tails twinkled before the racing hound, and a hawk rose, whistling"
189,--THOMAS TUSSER.,shrilly.
190,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
191,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No roads, no nothing!” said Sophie, her short skirt hooked by briers."
192,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I thought all England was a garden. There's your spire, George, across"
193,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the valley. How curious!”
194,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
195,--THOMAS TUSSER.,They walked toward it through an all-abandoned land. Here they found
196,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the ghost of a patch of lucerne that had refused to die: there a harsh
197,--THOMAS TUSSER.,fallow surrendered to yard-high thistles; and here a breadth of rampant
198,--THOMAS TUSSER.,kelk feigning to be lawful crop. In the ungrazed pastures swaths of dead
199,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"stuff caught their feet, and the ground beneath glistened with sweat. At"
200,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the bottom of the valley a little brook had undermined its footbridge,"
201,--THOMAS TUSSER.,and frothed in the wreckage. But there stood great woods on the slopes
202,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"beyond--old, tall, and brilliant, like unfaded tapestries against the"
203,--THOMAS TUSSER.,walls of a ruined house.
204,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
205,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“All this within a hundred miles of London,” he said. “Looks as if it"
206,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"had had nervous prostration, too.” The footpath turned the shoulder of"
207,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"a slope, through a thicket of rank rhododendrons, and crossed what had"
208,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"once been a carriage drive, which ended in the shadow of two gigantic"
209,--THOMAS TUSSER.,holm-oaks.
210,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
211,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“A house!” said Sophie, in a whisper. “A Colonial house!”"
212,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
213,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Behind the blue-green of the twin trees rose a dark-bluish brick
214,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Georgian pile, with a shell-shaped fan-light over its pillared door. The"
215,--THOMAS TUSSER.,hound had gone off on his own foolish quests. Except for some stir in
216,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the branches and the flight of four startled magpies; there was neither
217,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"life nor sound about the square house, but it looked out of its long"
218,--THOMAS TUSSER.,windows most friendlily.
219,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
220,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Cha-armed to meet you, I'm sure,” said Sophie, and curtsied to the"
221,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"ground. “George, this is history I can understand. We began here.” She"
222,--THOMAS TUSSER.,curtsied again.
223,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
224,--THOMAS TUSSER.,The June sunshine twinkled on all the lights. It was as though an old
225,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"lady, wise in three generations' experience, but for the present sitting"
226,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"out, bent to listen to her flushed and eager grandchild."
227,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
228,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I must look!” Sophie tiptoed to a window, and shaded her eyes with her"
229,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"hand. “Oh, this room's half-full of cotton-bales--wool, I suppose! But I"
230,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"can see a bit of the mantelpiece. George, do come! Isn't that some one?”"
231,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
232,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"She fell back behind her husband. The front door opened slowly, to show"
233,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the hound, his nose white with milk, in charge of an ancient of days"
234,--THOMAS TUSSER.,clad in a blue linen ephod curiously gathered on breast and shoulders.
235,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
236,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Certainly,” said George, half aloud. “Father Time himself. This is"
237,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"where he lives, Sophie.”"
238,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
239,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“We came,” said Sophie weakly. “Can we see the house? I'm afraid that's"
240,--THOMAS TUSSER.,our dog.”
241,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
242,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No, 'tis Rambler,” said the old man. “He's been at my swill-pail"
243,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"again. Staying at Rocketts, be ye? Come in. Ah! you runagate!”"
244,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
245,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"The hound broke from him, and he tottered after him down the drive. They"
246,--THOMAS TUSSER.,entered the hall--just such a high light hall as such a house
247,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"should own. A slim-balustered staircase, wide and shallow and once"
248,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"creamy-white, climbed out of it under a long oval window. On either side"
249,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"delicately moulded doors gave on to wool-lumbered rooms, whose sea-green"
250,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"mantelpieces were adorned with nymphs, scrolls, and Cupids in low"
251,--THOMAS TUSSER.,relief.
252,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
253,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“What's the firm that makes these things?” cried Sophie, enraptured."
254,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Oh, I forgot! These must be the originals. Adams, is it? I never"
255,--THOMAS TUSSER.,dreamed of anything like that steel-cut fender. Does he mean us to go
256,--THOMAS TUSSER.,everywhere?”
257,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
258,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“He's catching the dog,” said George, looking out. “We don't count.”"
259,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
260,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"They explored the first or ground floor, delighted as children playing"
261,--THOMAS TUSSER.,burglars.
262,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
263,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“This is like all England,” she said at last. “Wonderful, but no"
264,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"explanation. You're expected to know it beforehand. Now, let's try"
265,--THOMAS TUSSER.,upstairs.”
266,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
267,--THOMAS TUSSER.,The stairs never creaked beneath their feet. From the broad landing
268,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"they entered a long, green-panelled room lighted by three full-length"
269,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"windows, which overlooked the forlorn wreck of a terraced garden, and"
270,--THOMAS TUSSER.,wooded slopes beyond.
271,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
272,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“The drawing-room, of course.” Sophie swam up and down it. “That"
273,--THOMAS TUSSER.,mantelpiece--Orpheus and Eurydice--is the best of them all. Isn't it
274,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"marvellous? Why, the room seems furnished with nothing in it! How's"
275,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"that, George?”"
276,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
277,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“It's the proportions. I've noticed it.”
278,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
279,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I saw a Heppelwhite couch once”--Sophie laid her finger to her flushed
280,--THOMAS TUSSER.,cheek and considered. “With two of them--one on each side--you wouldn't
281,--THOMAS TUSSER.,need anything else. Except--there must be one perfect mirror over that
282,--THOMAS TUSSER.,mantelpiece.”
283,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
284,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Look at that view. It's a framed Constable,” her husband cried."
285,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
286,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No; it's a Morland--a parody of a Morland. But about that couch,"
287,--THOMAS TUSSER.,George. Don't you think Empire might be better than Heppelwhite? Dull
288,--THOMAS TUSSER.,gold against that pale green? It's a pity they don't make spinets
289,--THOMAS TUSSER.,nowadays.”
290,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
291,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I believe you can get them. Look at that oak wood behind the pines.”
292,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
293,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“'While you sat and played toccatas stately, at the clavichord,'” Sophie"
294,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"hummed, and, head on one side, nodded to where the perfect mirror"
295,--THOMAS TUSSER.,should hang.
296,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
297,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Then they found bedrooms with dressing-rooms and powdering-closets, and"
298,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"steps leading up and down--boxes of rooms, round, square, and octagonal,"
299,--THOMAS TUSSER.,with enriched ceilings and chased door-locks.
300,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
301,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Now about servants. Oh!” She had darted up the last stairs to the
302,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"chequered darkness of the top floor, where loose tiles lay among broken"
303,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"laths, and the walls were scrawled with names, sentiments, and hop"
304,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"records. “They've been keeping pigeons here,” she cried."
305,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
306,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“And you could drive a buggy through the roof anywhere,” said George."
307,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
308,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“That's what _I_ say,” the old man cried below them on the stairs. “Not a"
309,--THOMAS TUSSER.,dry place for my pigeons at all.”
310,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
311,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“But why was it allowed to get like this?” said Sophie.
312,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
313,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Tis with housen as teeth,” he replied. “Let 'em go too far, and there's"
314,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"nothing to be done. Time was they was minded to sell her, but none would"
315,--THOMAS TUSSER.,buy. She was too far away along from any place. Time was they'd ha'
316,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"lived here theyselves, but they took and died.”"
317,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
318,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Here?” Sophie moved beneath the light of a hole in the roof.
319,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
320,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Nah--none dies here excep' falling off ricks and such. In London they
321,--THOMAS TUSSER.,died.” He plucked a lock of wool from his blue smock. “They was no
322,--THOMAS TUSSER.,staple--neither the Elphicks nor the Moones. Shart and brittle all
323,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of 'em. Dead they be seventeen year, for I've been here caretakin'"
324,--THOMAS TUSSER.,twenty-five.”
325,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
326,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Who does all the wool belong to downstairs?” George asked.
327,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
328,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“To the estate. I'll show you the back parts if ye like. You're from
329,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"America, ain't ye? I've had a son there once myself.” They followed him"
330,--THOMAS TUSSER.,down the main stairway. He paused at the turn and swept one hand toward
331,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the wall. “Plenty room here for your coffin to come down. Seven foot
332,--THOMAS TUSSER.,and three men at each end wouldn't brish the paint. If I die in my bed
333,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"they'll 'ave to up-end me like a milk-can. 'Tis all luck, dye see?”"
334,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
335,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"He led them on and on, through a maze of back kitchens, dairies,"
336,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"larders, and sculleries, that melted along covered ways into a"
337,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"farm-house, visibly older than the main building, which again rambled"
338,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"out among barns, byres, pig-pens, stalls and stables to the dead fields"
339,--THOMAS TUSSER.,behind.
340,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
341,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Somehow,” said Sophie, sitting exhausted on an ancient"
342,--THOMAS TUSSER.,well-curb--“somehow one wouldn't insult these lovely old things by
343,--THOMAS TUSSER.,filling them with hay.”
344,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
345,--THOMAS TUSSER.,George looked at long stone walls upholding reaches of silvery-oak
346,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"weather-boarding; buttresses of mixed flint and bricks; outside stairs,"
347,--THOMAS TUSSER.,stone upon arched stone; curves of thatch where grass sprouted; roundels
348,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of house-leeked tiles, and a huge paved yard populated by two cows and"
349,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the repentant Rambler. He had not thought of himself or of the telegraph
350,--THOMAS TUSSER.,office for two and a half hours.
351,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
352,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“But why,” said Sophie, as they went back through the crater of stricken"
353,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"fields,--“why is one expected to know everything in England? Why do"
354,--THOMAS TUSSER.,they never tell?”
355,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
356,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“You mean about the Elphicks and the Moones?” he answered.
357,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
358,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Yes--and the lawyers and the estate. Who are they? I wonder whether
359,--THOMAS TUSSER.,those painted floors in the green room were real oak. Don't you like us
360,--THOMAS TUSSER.,exploring things together--better than Pompeii?”
361,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
362,--THOMAS TUSSER.,George turned once more to look at the view. “Eight hundred acres go
363,--THOMAS TUSSER.,with the house--the old man told me. Five farms altogether. Rocketts is
364,--THOMAS TUSSER.,one of 'em.”
365,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
366,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I like Mrs. Cloke. But what is the old house called?”
367,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
368,--THOMAS TUSSER.,George laughed. “That's one of the things you're expected to know. He
369,--THOMAS TUSSER.,never told me.”
370,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
371,--THOMAS TUSSER.,The Clokes were more communicative. That evening and thereafter for
372,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"a week they gave the Chapins the official history, as one gives it to"
373,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"lodgers, of Friars Pardon the house and its five farms. But Sophie"
374,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"asked so many questions, and George was so humanly interested, that,"
375,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"as confidence in the strangers grew, they launched, with observed and"
376,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"acquired detail, into the lives and deaths and doings of the Elphicks"
377,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"and the Moones and their collaterals, the Haylings and the Torrells. It"
378,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"was a tale told serially by Cloke in the barn, or his wife in the dairy,"
379,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the last chapters reserved for the kitchen o' nights by the big fire,"
380,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"when the two had been half the day exploring about the house, where"
381,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"old Iggulden, of the blue smock, cackled and chuckled to see them. The"
382,--THOMAS TUSSER.,motives that swayed the characters were beyond their comprehension; the
383,--THOMAS TUSSER.,fates that shifted them were gods they had never met; the sidelights
384,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Mrs. Cloke threw on act and incident were more amazing than anything in
385,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the record. Therefore the Chapins listened delightedly, and blessed Mrs."
386,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Shonts.
387,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
388,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“But why--why--why--did So-and-so do so-and-so?” Sophie would demand
389,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"from her seat by the pothook; and Mrs. Cloke would answer, smoothing her"
390,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"knees, “For the sake of the place.”"
391,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
392,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I give it up,” said George one night in their own room. “People don't"
393,--THOMAS TUSSER.,seem to matter in this country compared to the places they live in. The
394,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"way she tells it, Friars Pardon was a sort of Moloch.”"
395,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
396,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Poor old thing!” They had been walking round the farms as usual before
397,--THOMAS TUSSER.,tea. “No wonder they loved it. Think of the sacrifices they made for it.
398,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Jane Elphick married the younger Torrell to keep it in the family. The
399,--THOMAS TUSSER.,octagonal room with the moulded ceiling next to the big bedroom was
400,--THOMAS TUSSER.,hers. Now what did he tell you while he was feeding the pigs?” said
401,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Sophie.
402,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
403,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“About the Torrell cousins and the uncle who died in Java. They lived at
404,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Burnt House--behind High Pardons, where that brook is all blocked up.”"
405,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
406,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No; Burnt House is under High Pardons Wood, before you come to Gale"
407,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Anstey,” Sophie corrected."
408,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
409,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Well, old man Cloke said--”"
410,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
411,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Sophie threw open the door and called down into the kitchen, where the"
412,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Clokes were covering the fire: “Mrs. Cloke, isn't Burnt House under High"
413,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Pardons?”
414,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
415,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Yes, my dear, of course,” the soft voice answered absently. A cough."
416,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I beg your pardon, Madam. What was it you said?”"
417,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
418,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Never mind. I prefer it the other way,” Sophie laughed, and George"
419,--THOMAS TUSSER.,re-told the missing chapter as she sat on the bed.
420,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
421,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Here to-day an' gone to-morrow,” said Cloke warningly. “They've"
422,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"paid their first month, but we've only that Mrs. Shonts's letter for"
423,--THOMAS TUSSER.,guarantee.”
424,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
425,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“None she sent never cheated us yet. It slipped out before I thought.
426,--THOMAS TUSSER.,She's a most humane young lady. They'll be going away in a little. An'
427,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"you've talked a lot too, Alfred.”"
428,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
429,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Yes, but the Elphicks are all dead. No one can bring my loose talking"
430,--THOMAS TUSSER.,home to me. But why do they stay on and stay on so?”
431,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
432,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"In due time George and Sophie asked each other that question, and put it"
433,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"aside. They argued that the climate--a pearly blend, unlike the hot"
434,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"and cold ferocities of their native land--suited them, as the thick"
435,--THOMAS TUSSER.,stillness of the nights certainly suited George. He was saved even the
436,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"sight of a metalled road, which, as presumably leading to business,"
437,--THOMAS TUSSER.,wakes desire in a man; and the telegraph office at the village of Friars
438,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Pardon, where they sold picture post-cards and peg-tops, was two walking"
439,--THOMAS TUSSER.,miles across the fields and woods.
440,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
441,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"For all that touched his past among his fellows, or their remembrance"
442,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of him, he might have been in another planet; and Sophie, whose life had"
443,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"been very largely spent among husbandless wives of lofty ideals, had"
444,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"no wish to leave this present of God. The unhurried meals, the"
445,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"foreknowledge of deliciously empty hours to follow, the breadths of soft"
446,--THOMAS TUSSER.,sky under which they walked together and reckoned time only by their
447,--THOMAS TUSSER.,hunger or thirst; the good grass beneath their feet that cheated the
448,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"miles; their discoveries, always together, amid the farms--Griffons,"
449,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Rocketts, Burnt House, Gale Anstey, and the Home Farm, where Iggulden of"
450,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the blue smock-frock would waylay them, and they would ransack the old"
451,--THOMAS TUSSER.,house once more; the long wet afternoons when they tucked up their
452,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"feet on the bedroom's deep window-sill over against the apple-trees, and"
453,--THOMAS TUSSER.,talked together as never till then had they found time to talk--these
454,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"things contented her soul, and her body throve."
455,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
456,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Have you realized,” she asked one morning, “that we've been here"
457,--THOMAS TUSSER.,absolutely alone for the last thirty-four days?”
458,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
459,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Have you counted them?” he asked.
460,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
461,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Did you like them?” she replied.
462,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
463,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I must have. I didn't think about them. Yes, I have. Six months ago I"
464,--THOMAS TUSSER.,should have fretted myself sick. Remember at Cairo? I've only had two or
465,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"three bad times. Am I getting better, or is it senile decay?”"
466,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
467,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Climate, all climate.” Sophie swung her new-bought English boots, as"
468,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"she sat on the stile overlooking Friars Pardon, behind the Clokes's"
469,--THOMAS TUSSER.,barn.
470,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
471,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“One must take hold of things though,” he said, “if it's only to keep"
472,--THOMAS TUSSER.,one's hand in.” His eyes did not flicker now as they swept the empty
473,--THOMAS TUSSER.,fields. “Mustn't one?”
474,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
475,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Lay out a Morristown links over Gale Anstey. I dare say you could hire
476,--THOMAS TUSSER.,it.”
477,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
478,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No, I'm not as English as that--nor as Morristown. Cloke says all the"
479,--THOMAS TUSSER.,farms here could be made to pay.”
480,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
481,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Well, I'm Anastasia in the 'Treasure of Franchard.' I'm content to be"
482,--THOMAS TUSSER.,alive and purr. There's no hurry.”
483,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
484,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No.” He smiled. “All the same, I'm going to see after my mail.”"
485,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
486,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“You promised you wouldn't have any.”
487,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
488,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“There's some business coming through that's amusing me. Honest. It
489,--THOMAS TUSSER.,doesn't get on my nerves at all.”
490,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
491,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Want a secretary?”
492,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
493,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No, thanks, old thing! Isn't that quite English?”"
494,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
495,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Too English! Go away.” But none the less in broad daylight she returned
496,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the kiss. “I'm off to Pardons. I haven't been to the house for nearly a
497,--THOMAS TUSSER.,week.”
498,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
499,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“How've you decided to furnish Jane Elphick's bedroom?” he laughed, for"
500,--THOMAS TUSSER.,it had come to be a permanent Castle in Spain between them.
501,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
502,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Black Chinese furniture and yellow silk brocade,” she answered, and"
503,--THOMAS TUSSER.,ran downhill. She scattered a few cows at a gap with a flourish of a
504,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"ground-ash that Iggulden had cut for her a week ago, and singing as she"
505,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"passed under the holmoaks, sought the farm-house at the back of"
506,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Friars Pardon. The old man was not to be found, and she knocked at"
507,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"his half-opened door, for she needed him to fill her idle forenoon. A"
508,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"blue-eyed sheep-dog, a new friend, and Rambler's old enemy, crawled out"
509,--THOMAS TUSSER.,and besought her to enter.
510,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
511,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Iggulden sat in his chair by the fire, a thistle-spud between his knees,"
512,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"his head drooped. Though she had never seen death before, her heart,"
513,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"that missed a beat, told her that he was dead. She did not speak or cry,"
514,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"but stood outside the door, and the dog licked her hand. When he threw"
515,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"up his nose, she heard herself saying: “Don't howl! Please don't begin"
516,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"to howl, Scottie, or I shall run away!”"
517,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
518,--THOMAS TUSSER.,She held her ground while the shadows in the rickyard moved toward noon;
519,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"sat after a while on the steps by the door, her arms round the dog's"
520,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"neck, waiting till some one should come. She watched the smokeless"
521,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"chimneys of Friars Pardon slash its roofs with shadow, and the smoke of"
522,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Iggulden's last lighted fire gradually thin and cease. Against her will
523,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"she fell to wondering how many Moones, Elphicks, and Torrells had been"
524,--THOMAS TUSSER.,swung round the turn of the broad Mall stairs. Then she remembered the
525,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"old man's talk of being “up-ended like a milk-can,” and buried her face"
526,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"on Scottie's neck. At last a horse's feet clinked upon flags, rustled"
527,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"in the old grey straw of the rickyard, and she found herself facing"
528,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the vicar--a figure she had seen at church declaiming impossibilities
529,--THOMAS TUSSER.,(Sophie was a Unitarian) in an unnatural voice.
530,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
531,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“He's dead,” she said, without preface."
532,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
533,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Old Iggulden? I was coming for a talk with him.” The vicar passed in
534,--THOMAS TUSSER.,uncovered. “Ah!” she heard him say. “Heart-failure! How long have you
535,--THOMAS TUSSER.,been here?”
536,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
537,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Since a quarter to eleven.” She looked at her watch earnestly and saw
538,--THOMAS TUSSER.,that her hand did not shake.
539,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
540,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I'll sit with him now till the doctor comes. D'you think you could
541,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"tell him, and--yes, Mrs. Betts in the cottage with the wistaria next the"
542,--THOMAS TUSSER.,blacksmith's? I'm afraid this has been rather a shock to you.”
543,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
544,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Sophie nodded, and fled toward the village. Her body failed her for a"
545,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"moment; she dropped beneath a hedge, and looked back at the great house."
546,--THOMAS TUSSER.,In some fashion its silence and stolidity steadied her for her errand.
547,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
548,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Mrs. Betts, small, black-eyed, and dark, was almost as unconcerned as"
549,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Friars Pardon.
550,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
551,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Yiss, yiss, of course. Dear me! Well, Iggulden he had had his day in my"
552,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"father's time. Muriel, get me my little blue bag, please. Yiss, ma'am."
553,--THOMAS TUSSER.,They come down like ellum-branches in still weather. No warnin' at all.
554,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Muriel, my bicycle's be'ind the fowlhouse. I'll tell Dr. Dallas, ma'am.”"
555,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
556,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"She trundled off on her wheel like a brown bee, while Sophie--heaven"
557,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"above and earth beneath changed--walked stiffly home, to fall over"
558,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"George at his letters, in a muddle of laughter and tears."
559,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
560,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“It's all quite natural for them,” she gasped. “They come down like"
561,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"ellum-branches in still weather. Yiss, ma'am.' No, there wasn't anything"
562,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"in the least horrible, only--only--Oh, George, that poor shiny stick of"
563,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"his between his poor, thin knees! I couldn't have borne it if Scottie"
564,--THOMAS TUSSER.,had howled. I didn't know the vicar was so--so sensitive. He said he was
565,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"afraid it was ra--rather a shock. Mrs. Betts told me to go home, and"
566,--THOMAS TUSSER.,I wanted to collapse on her floor. But I didn't disgrace myself. I--I
567,--THOMAS TUSSER.,couldn't have left him--could I?”
568,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
569,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“You're sure you've took no 'arm?” cried Mrs. Cloke, who had heard the"
570,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"news by farm-telegraphy, which is older but swifter than Marconi's."
571,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
572,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No. I'm perfectly well,” Sophie protested."
573,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
574,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“You lay down till tea-time.” Mrs. Cloke patted her shoulder. “THEY'll
575,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"be very pleased, though she 'as 'ad no proper understandin' for twenty"
576,--THOMAS TUSSER.,years.”
577,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
578,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“They” came before twilight--a black-bearded man in moleskins, and a"
579,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"little palsied old woman, who chirruped like a wren."
580,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
581,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I'm his son,” said the man to Sophie, among the lavender bushes. “We"
582,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"'ad a difference--twenty year back, and didn't speak since. But I'm his"
583,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"son all the 'same, and we thank you for the watching.”"
584,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
585,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I'm only glad I happened to be there,” she answered, and from the"
586,--THOMAS TUSSER.,bottom of her heart she meant it.
587,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
588,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“We heard he spoke a lot o' you--one time an' another since you came. We
589,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"thank you kindly,” the man added."
590,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
591,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Are you the son that was in America?” she asked.
592,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
593,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Yes, ma'am. On my uncle's farm, in Connecticut. He was what they call"
594,--THOMAS TUSSER.,rood-master there.”
595,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
596,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Whereabouts in Connecticut?” asked George over her shoulder.
597,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
598,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Veering Holler was the name. I was there six year with my uncle.”
599,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
600,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“How small the world is!” Sophie cried. “Why, all my mother's people"
601,--THOMAS TUSSER.,come from Veering Hollow. There must be some there still--the Lashmars.
602,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Did you ever hear of them?”
603,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
604,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I remember hearing that name, seems to me,” he answered, but his face"
605,--THOMAS TUSSER.,was blank as the back of a spade.
606,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
607,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"A little before dusk a woman in grey, striding like a foot-soldier, and"
608,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"bearing on her arm a long pole, crashed through the orchard calling for"
609,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"food. George, upon whom the unannounced English worked mysteriously,"
610,--THOMAS TUSSER.,fled to the parlour; but Mrs. Cloke came forward beaming. Sophie could
611,--THOMAS TUSSER.,not escape.
612,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
613,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“We've only just heard of it;” said the stranger, turning on her. “I've"
614,--THOMAS TUSSER.,been out with the otter-hounds all day. It was a splendidly sportin'
615,--THOMAS TUSSER.,thing--”
616,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
617,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Did you--er--kill?” said Sophie. She knew from books she could not go
618,--THOMAS TUSSER.,far wrong here.
619,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
620,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Yes, a dry bitch--seventeen pounds,” was the answer. “A splendidly"
621,--THOMAS TUSSER.,sportin' thing of you to do. Poor old Iggulden--”
622,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
623,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Oh--that!” said Sophie, enlightened."
624,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
625,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“If there had been any people at Pardons it would never have happened.
626,--THOMAS TUSSER.,He'd have been looked after. But what can you expect from a parcel of
627,--THOMAS TUSSER.,London solicitors?”
628,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
629,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Mrs. Cloke murmured something.
630,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
631,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“No. I'm soaked from the knees down. If I hang about I shall get
632,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"chilled. A cup of tea, Mrs. Cloke, and I can eat one of your sandwiches"
633,--THOMAS TUSSER.,as I go.” She wiped her weather-worn face with a green and yellow silk
634,--THOMAS TUSSER.,handkerchief.
635,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
636,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Yes, my lady!” Mrs. Cloke ran and returned swiftly."
637,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
638,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Our land marches with Pardons for a mile on the south,” she explained,"
639,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"waving the full cup, “but one has quite enough to do with one's own"
640,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"people without poachin'. Still, if I'd known, I'd have sent Dora, of"
641,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"course. Have you seen her this afternoon, Mrs. Cloke? No? I wonder"
642,--THOMAS TUSSER.,whether that girl did sprain her ankle. Thank you.” It was a formidable
643,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"hunk of bread and bacon that Mrs. Cloke presented. “As I was sayin',"
644,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Pardons is a scandal! Lettin' people die like dogs. There ought to be
645,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"people there who do their duty. You've done yours, though there wasn't"
646,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the faintest call upon you. Good night. Tell Dora, if she comes, I've"
647,--THOMAS TUSSER.,gone on.”
648,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
649,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"She strode away, munching her crust, and Sophie reeled breathless into"
650,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the parlour, to shake the shaking George."
651,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
652,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Why did you keep catching my eye behind the blind? Why didn't you come
653,--THOMAS TUSSER.,out and do your duty?”
654,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
655,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Because I should have burst. Did you see the mud on its cheek?” he
656,--THOMAS TUSSER.,said.
657,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
658,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Once. I daren't look again. Who is she?”
659,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
660,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“God--a local deity then. Anyway, she's another of the things you're"
661,--THOMAS TUSSER.,expected to know by instinct.”
662,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
663,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Mrs. Cloke, shocked at their levity, told them that it was Lady"
664,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Conant, wife of Sir Walter Conant, Baronet, a large landholder in the"
665,--THOMAS TUSSER.,neighbourhood; and if not God; at least His visible Providence. George
666,--THOMAS TUSSER.,made her talk of that family for an hour.
667,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
668,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Laughter,” said Sophie afterward in their own room, “is the mark of the"
669,--THOMAS TUSSER.,savage. Why couldn't you control your emotions? It's all real to her.”
670,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
671,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“It's all real to me. That's my trouble,” he answered in an altered"
672,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"tone. “Anyway, it's real enough to mark time with. Don't you think so?”"
673,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
674,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“What d'you mean?” she asked quickly, though she knew his voice."
675,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
676,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“That I'm better. I'm well enough to kick.”
677,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
678,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“What at?”
679,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
680,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“This!” He waved his hand round the one room. “I must have something to
681,--THOMAS TUSSER.,play with till I'm fit for work again.”
682,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
683,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Ah!” She sat on the bed and leaned forward, her hands clasped. “I"
684,--THOMAS TUSSER.,wonder if it's good for you.”
685,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
686,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“We've been better here than anywhere,” he went on slowly. “One could"
687,--THOMAS TUSSER.,always sell it again.”
688,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
689,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"She nodded gravely, but her eyes sparkled."
690,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
691,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“The only thing that worries me is what happened this morning. I want to
692,--THOMAS TUSSER.,know how you feel about it. If it's on your nerves in the least we can
693,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"have the old farm at the back of the house pulled down, or perhaps it"
694,--THOMAS TUSSER.,has spoiled the notion for you?”
695,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
696,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Pull it down?” she cried. “You've no business faculty. Why, that's"
697,--THOMAS TUSSER.,where we could live while we're putting the big house in order. It's
698,--THOMAS TUSSER.,almost under the same roof. No! What happened this morning seemed to be
699,--THOMAS TUSSER.,more of a--of a leading than anything else. There ought to be people at
700,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Pardons. Lady Conant's quite right.”
701,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
702,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I was thinking more of the woods and the roads. I could double the
703,--THOMAS TUSSER.,value of the place in six months.”
704,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
705,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“What do they want for it?” She shook her head, and her loosened hair"
706,--THOMAS TUSSER.,fell glowingly about her cheeks.
707,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
708,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Seventy-five thousand dollars. They'll take sixty-eight.”
709,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
710,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Less than half what we paid for our old yacht when we married. And we
711,--THOMAS TUSSER.,didn't have a good time in her. You were--”
712,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
713,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Well, I discovered I was too much of an American to be content to be a"
714,--THOMAS TUSSER.,rich man's son. You aren't blaming me for that?”
715,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
716,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Oh, no. Only it was a very businesslike honeymoon. How far are you"
717,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"along with the deal, George?”"
718,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
719,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I can mail the deposit on the purchase money to-morrow morning, and we"
720,--THOMAS TUSSER.,can have the thing completed in a fortnight or three weeks--if you say
721,--THOMAS TUSSER.,so.”
722,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
723,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Friars Pardon--Friars Pardon!” Sophie chanted rapturously, her dark"
724,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"gray eyes big with delight. “All the farms? Gale Anstey, Burnt House,"
725,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Rocketts, the Home Farm, and Griffons? Sure you've got 'em all?”"
726,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
727,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Sure.” He smiled.
728,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
729,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“And the woods? High Pardons Wood, Lower Pardons, Suttons, Dutton's"
730,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Shaw, Reuben's Ghyll, Maxey's Ghyll, and both the Oak Hangers? Sure"
731,--THOMAS TUSSER.,you've got 'em all?”
732,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
733,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Every last stick. Why, you know them as well as I do.” He laughed."
734,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“They say there's five thousand--a thousand pounds' worth of
735,--THOMAS TUSSER.,lumber--timber they call it--in the Hangers alone.”
736,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
737,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Mrs. Cloke's oven must be mended first thing, and the kitchen roof. I"
738,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"think I'll have all this whitewashed,” Sophie broke in, pointing to"
739,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the ceiling. “The whole place is a scandal. Lady Conant is quite right.
740,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"George, when did you begin to fall in love with the house? In the"
741,--THOMAS TUSSER.,greenroom—that first day? I did.”
742,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
743,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I'm not in love with it. One must do something to mark time till one's
744,--THOMAS TUSSER.,fit for work.”
745,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
746,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Or when we stood under the oaks, and the door opened? Oh! Ought I to go"
747,--THOMAS TUSSER.,to poor Iggulden's funeral?” She sighed with utter happiness.
748,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
749,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Wouldn't they call it a liberty now?” said he.
750,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
751,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“But I liked him.”
752,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
753,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“But you didn't own him at the date of his death.”
754,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
755,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“That wouldn't keep me away. Only, they made such a fuss about the"
756,--THOMAS TUSSER.,watching”--she caught her breath--“it might be ostentatious from that
757,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"point of view, too. Oh, George”--she reached for his hand--“we're two"
758,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"little orphans moving in worlds not realized, and we shall make some bad"
759,--THOMAS TUSSER.,breaks. But we're going to have the time of our lives.”
760,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
761,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“We'll run up to London to-morrow, and see if we can hurry those English"
762,--THOMAS TUSSER.,law solicitors. I want to get to work.”
763,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
764,--THOMAS TUSSER.,They went. They suffered many things ere they returned across the fields
765,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"in a fly one Saturday night, nursing a two by two-and-a-half box of"
766,--THOMAS TUSSER.,deeds and maps--lawful owners of Friars Pardon and the five decayed
767,--THOMAS TUSSER.,farms therewith.
768,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
769,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I do most sincerely 'ope and trust you'll be 'appy, Madam,” Mrs. Cloke"
770,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"gasped, when she was told the news by the kitchen fire."
771,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
772,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Goodness! It isn't a marriage!” Sophie exclaimed, a little awed; for to"
773,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"them the joke, which to an American means work, was only just beginning."
774,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
775,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“If it's took in a proper spirit”--Mrs. Cloke's eye turned toward her
776,--THOMAS TUSSER.,oven.
777,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
778,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Send and have that mended to-morrow,” Sophie whispered."
779,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
780,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“We couldn't 'elp noticing,” said Cloke slowly, “from the times you"
781,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"walked there, that you an' your lady was drawn to it, but--but I don't"
782,--THOMAS TUSSER.,know as we ever precisely thought--” His wife's glance checked him.
783,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
784,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“That we were that sort of people,” said George. “We aren't sure of it"
785,--THOMAS TUSSER.,ourselves yet.”
786,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
787,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Perhaps,” said Cloke, rubbing his knees, “just for the sake of saying"
788,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"something, perhaps you'll park it?”"
789,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
790,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“What's that?” said George.
791,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
792,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Turn it all into a fine park like Violet Hill”--he jerked a thumb to
793,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"westward--“that Mr. Sangres bought. It was four farms, and Mr. Sangres"
794,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"made a fine park of them, with a herd of faller deer.”"
795,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
796,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Then it wouldn't be Friars Pardon,” said Sophie. “Would it?”"
797,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
798,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I don't know as I've ever heard Pardons was ever anything but wheat an'
799,--THOMAS TUSSER.,wool. Only some gentlemen say that parks are less trouble than tenants.”
800,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"He laughed nervously. “But the gentry, o' course, they keep on pretty"
801,--THOMAS TUSSER.,much as they was used to.”
802,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
803,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I see,” said Sophie. “How did Mr. Sangres make his money?”"
804,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
805,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I never rightly heard. It was pepper an' spices, or it may ha' been"
806,--THOMAS TUSSER.,gloves. No. Gloves was Sir Reginald Liss at Marley End. Spices was Mr.
807,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Sangres. He's a Brazilian gentleman--very sunburnt like.”
808,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
809,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Be sure o' one thing. You won't 'ave any trouble,” said Mrs. Cloke,"
810,--THOMAS TUSSER.,just before they went to bed.
811,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
812,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Now the news of the purchase was told to Mr. and Mrs. Cloke alone at 8
813,--THOMAS TUSSER.,P.M. of a Saturday. None left the farm till they set out for church next
814,--THOMAS TUSSER.,morning. Yet when they reached the church and were about to slip aside
815,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"into their usual seats, a little beyond the font, where they could see"
816,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"the red-furred tails of the bellropes waggle and twist at ringing time,"
817,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"they were swept forward irresistibly, a Cloke on either flank (and yet"
818,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"they had not walked with the Clokes), upon the ever-retiring bosom of a"
819,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"black-gowned verger, who ushered them into a room of a pew at the head"
820,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of the left aisle, under the pulpit."
821,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
822,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“This,” he sighed reproachfully, “is the Pardons' Pew,” and shut them"
823,--THOMAS TUSSER.,in.
824,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
825,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"They could see little more than the choir boys in the chancel, but to"
826,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the roots of the hair of their necks they felt the congregation behind
827,--THOMAS TUSSER.,mercilessly devouring them by look.
828,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
829,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“When the wicked man turneth away.” The strong, alien voice of the"
830,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"priest vibrated under the hammer-beam roof, and a loneliness unfelt"
831,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"before swamped their hearts, as they searched for places in the"
832,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"unfamiliar Church of England service. The Lord's Prayer “Our Father,"
833,--THOMAS TUSSER.,which art”--set the seal on that desolation. Sophie found herself
834,--THOMAS TUSSER.,thinking how in other lands their purchase would long ere this have been
835,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"discussed from every point of view in a dozen prints, forgetting that"
836,--THOMAS TUSSER.,George for months had not been allowed to glance at those black and
837,--THOMAS TUSSER.,bellowing head-lines. Here was nothing but silence--not even hostility!
838,--THOMAS TUSSER.,The game was up to them; the other players hid their cards and waited.
839,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Suspense, she felt, was in the air, and when her sight cleared, saw,"
840,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"indeed, a mural tablet of a footless bird brooding upon the carven"
841,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"motto, “Wayte awhyle--wayte awhyle.”"
842,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
843,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"At the Litany George had trouble with an unstable hassock, and drew the"
844,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"slip of carpet under the pewseat. Sophie pushed her end back also, and"
845,--THOMAS TUSSER.,shut her eyes against a burning that felt like tears. When she opened
846,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"them she was looking at her mother's maiden name, fairly carved on a"
847,--THOMAS TUSSER.,blue flagstone on the pew floor:
848,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
849,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Ellen Lashmar. ob. 1796. ætat 27.
850,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
851,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"She nudged George and pointed. Sheltered, as they kneeled, they looked"
852,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"for more knowledge, but the rest of the slab was blank."
853,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
854,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Ever hear of her?” he whispered.
855,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
856,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Never knew any of us came from here.”
857,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
858,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Coincidence?”
859,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
860,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Perhaps. But it makes me feel better,” and she smiled and winked away"
861,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"a tear on her lashes, and took his hand while they prayed for “all women"
862,--THOMAS TUSSER.,labouring of child”--not “in the perils of childbirth”; and the sparrows
863,--THOMAS TUSSER.,who had found their way through the guards behind the glass windows
864,--THOMAS TUSSER.,chirped above the faded gilt and alabaster family tree of the Conants.
865,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
866,--THOMAS TUSSER.,The baronet's pew was on the right of the aisle. After service its
867,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"inhabitants moved forth without haste, but so as to block effectively a"
868,--THOMAS TUSSER.,dusky person with a large family who champed in their rear.
869,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
870,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Spices, I think,” said Sophie, deeply delighted as the Sangres closed"
871,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"up after the Conants. “Let 'em get away, George.”"
872,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
873,--THOMAS TUSSER.,But when they came out many folk whose eyes were one still lingered by
874,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the lychgate.
875,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
876,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I want to see if any more Lashmars are buried here,” said Sophie."
877,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
878,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Not now. This seems to be show day. Come home quickly,” he replied."
879,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
880,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"A group of families, the Clokes a little apart, opened to let them"
881,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"through. The men saluted with jerky nods, the women with remnants of a"
882,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"curtsey. Only Iggulden's son, his mother on his arm, lifted his hat as"
883,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Sophie passed.
884,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
885,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Your people,” said the clear voice of Lady Conant in her ear."
886,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
887,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I suppose so,” said Sophie, blushing, for they were within two yards of"
888,--THOMAS TUSSER.,her; but it was not a question.
889,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
890,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Then that child looks as if it were coming down with mumps. You ought
891,--THOMAS TUSSER.,to tell the mother she shouldn't have brought it to church.”
892,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
893,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I can't leave 'er behind, my lady,” the woman said. “She'd set the"
894,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"'ouse afire in a minute, she's that forward with the matches. Ain't you,"
895,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Maudie dear?”
896,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
897,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Has Dr. Dallas seen her?”
898,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
899,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Not yet, my lady.”"
900,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
901,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“He must. You can't get away, of course. M-m! My idiotic maid is coming"
902,--THOMAS TUSSER.,in for her teeth to-morrow at twelve. She shall pick her up--at Gale
903,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Anstey, isn't it?--at eleven.”"
904,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
905,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Yes. Thank you very much, my lady.”"
906,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
907,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I oughtn't to have done it,” said Lady Conant apologetically, “but"
908,--THOMAS TUSSER.,there has been no one at Pardons for so long that you'll forgive my
909,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"poaching. Now, can't you lunch with us? The vicar usually comes too."
910,--THOMAS TUSSER.,I don't use the horses on a Sunday”--she glanced at the Brazilian's
911,--THOMAS TUSSER.,silver-plated chariot. “It's only a mile across the fields.”
912,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
913,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“You--you're very kind,” said Sophie, hating herself because her lip"
914,--THOMAS TUSSER.,trembled.
915,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
916,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“My dear,” the compelling tone dropped to a soothing gurgle, “d'you"
917,--THOMAS TUSSER.,suppose I don't know how it feels to come to a strange county--country
918,--THOMAS TUSSER.,I should say--away from one's own people? When I first left the
919,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Shires--I'm Shropshire, you know--I cried for a day and a night. But"
920,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"fretting doesn't make loneliness any better. Oh, here's Dora. She did"
921,--THOMAS TUSSER.,sprain her leg that day.”
922,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
923,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I'm as lame as a tree still,” said the tall maiden frankly. “You ought"
924,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"to go out with the otter-hounds, Mrs. Chapin. I believe they're drawing"
925,--THOMAS TUSSER.,your water next week.”
926,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
927,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Sir Walter had already led off George, and the vicar came up on the"
928,--THOMAS TUSSER.,other side of Sophie. There was no escaping the swift procession or the
929,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"leisurely lunch, where talk came and went in low-voiced eddies that"
930,--THOMAS TUSSER.,had the village for their centre. Sophie heard the vicar and Sir Walter
931,--THOMAS TUSSER.,address her husband lightly as Chapin! (She also remembered many women
932,--THOMAS TUSSER.,known in a previous life who habitually addressed their husbands as
933,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Mr. Such-an-one.) After lunch Lady Conant talked to her explicitly of
934,--THOMAS TUSSER.,maternity as that is achieved in cottages and farm-houses remote from
935,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"aid, and of the duty thereto of the mistress of Pardons."
936,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
937,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"A gate in a beech hedge, reached across triple lawns, let them out"
938,--THOMAS TUSSER.,before tea-time into the unkempt south side of their land.
939,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
940,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I want your hand, please,” said Sophie as soon as they were safe among"
941,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the beech boles and the lawless hollies. “D'you remember the old maid in
942,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"'Providence and the Guitar' who heard the Commissary swear, and hardly"
943,--THOMAS TUSSER.,reckoned herself a maiden lady afterward? Because I'm a relative of
944,--THOMAS TUSSER.,hers. Lady Conant is--”
945,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
946,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Did you find out anything about the Lashmars?” he interrupted.
947,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
948,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I didn't ask. I'm going to write to Aunt Sydney about it first. Oh,"
949,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Lady Conant said something at lunch about their having bought some land
950,--THOMAS TUSSER.,from some Lashmars a few years ago. I found it was at the beginning of
951,--THOMAS TUSSER.,last century.”
952,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
953,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“What did you say?”
954,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
955,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I said, 'Really, how interesting!' Like that. I'm not going to push"
956,--THOMAS TUSSER.,myself forward. I've been hearing about Mr. Sangres's efforts in that
957,--THOMAS TUSSER.,direction. And you? I couldn't see you behind the flowers. Was it very
958,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"deep water, dear?”"
959,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
960,--THOMAS TUSSER.,George mopped a brow already browned by outdoor exposures.
961,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
962,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Oh no--dead easy,” he answered. “I've bought Friars Pardon to prevent"
963,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Sir Walter's birds straying.”
964,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
965,--THOMAS TUSSER.,A cock pheasant scuttered through the dry leaves and exploded almost
966,--THOMAS TUSSER.,under their feet. Sophie jumped.
967,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
968,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“That's one of 'em,” said George calmly."
969,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
970,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Well, your nerves are better, at any rate,” said she. “Did you tell 'em"
971,--THOMAS TUSSER.,you'd bought the thing to play with?”
972,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
973,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“No. That was where my nerve broke down. I only made one bad break--I
974,--THOMAS TUSSER.,think. I said I couldn't see why hiring land to men to farm wasn't as
975,--THOMAS TUSSER.,much a business proposition as anything else.”
976,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
977,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“And what did they say?”
978,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
979,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“They smiled. I shall know what that smile means some day. They don't
980,--THOMAS TUSSER.,waste their smiles. D'you see that track by Gale Anstey?”
981,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
982,--THOMAS TUSSER.,They looked down from the edge of the hanger over a cup-like hollow.
983,--THOMAS TUSSER.,People by twos and threes in their Sunday best filed slowly along the
984,--THOMAS TUSSER.,paths that connected farm to farm.
985,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
986,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I've never seen so many on our land before,” said Sophie. “Why is it?”"
987,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
988,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“To show us we mustn't shut up their rights of way.”
989,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
990,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Those cow-tracks we've been using cross lots?” said Sophie forcibly.
991,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
992,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Yes. Any one of 'em would cost us two thousand pounds each in legal
993,--THOMAS TUSSER.,expenses to close.”
994,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
995,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“But we don't want to,” she said."
996,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
997,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“The whole community would fight if we did.”
998,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
999,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“But it's our land. We can do what we like.”
1000,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1001,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“It's not our land. We've only paid for it. We belong to it, and it"
1002,--THOMAS TUSSER.,belongs to the people--our people they call 'em. I've been to lunch with
1003,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the English too.”
1004,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1005,--THOMAS TUSSER.,They passed slowly from one bracken-dotted field to the next--flushed
1006,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"with pride of ownership, plotting alterations and restorations at each"
1007,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"turn; halting in their tracks to argue, spreading apart to embrace two"
1008,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"views at once, or closing in to consider one. Couples moved out of their"
1009,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"way, but smiling covertly."
1010,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1011,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“We shall make some bad breaks,” he said at last."
1012,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1013,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Together, though. You won't let anyone else in, will you?”"
1014,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1015,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Except the contractors. This syndicate handles this proposition by its
1016,--THOMAS TUSSER.,little lone.”
1017,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1018,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“But you might feel the want of some one,” she insisted."
1019,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1020,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I shall--but it will be you. It's business, Sophie, but it's going to"
1021,--THOMAS TUSSER.,be good fun.”
1022,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1023,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Please God,” she answered flushing, and cried to herself as they went"
1024,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"back to tea. “It's worth it. Oh, it's worth it.”"
1025,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1026,--THOMAS TUSSER.,The repairing and moving into Friars Pardon was business of the most
1027,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"varied and searching, but all done English fashion, without friction."
1028,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Time and money alone were asked. The rest lay in the hands of beneficent
1029,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"advisers from London, or spirits, male and female, called up by Mr. and"
1030,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Mrs. Cloke from the wastes of the farms. In the centre stood George and
1031,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Sophie, a little aghast, their interests reaching out on every side."
1032,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1033,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I ain't sayin' anything against Londoners,” said Cloke, self-appointed"
1034,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"clerk of the outer works, consulting engineer, head of the immigration"
1035,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"bureau, and superintendent of woods and forests; “but your own people"
1036,--THOMAS TUSSER.,won't go about to make more than a fair profit out of you.”
1037,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1038,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“How is one to know?” said George.
1039,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1040,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Five years from now, or so on, maybe, you'll be lookin' over your first"
1041,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"year's accounts, and, knowin' what you'll know then, you'll say: 'Well,"
1042,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Billy Beartup'--or Old Cloke as it might be--'did me proper when I was
1043,--THOMAS TUSSER.,new.' No man likes to have that sort of thing laid up against him.”
1044,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1045,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I think I see,” said George. “But five years is a long time to look"
1046,--THOMAS TUSSER.,ahead.”
1047,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1048,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I doubt if that oak Billy Beartup throwed in Reuben's Ghyll will be fit
1049,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"for her drawin’-room floor in less than seven,” Cloke drawled."
1050,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1051,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Yes, that's my work,” said Sophie. (Billy Beartup of Griffons,"
1052,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"a woodman by training and birth, a tenant farmer by misfortune of"
1053,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"marriage, had laid his broad axe at her feet a month before.) “Sorry if"
1054,--THOMAS TUSSER.,I've committed you to another eternity.”
1055,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1056,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“And we shan't even know where we've gone wrong with your new carriage
1057,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"drive before that time either,” said Cloke, ever anxious to keep the"
1058,--THOMAS TUSSER.,balance true with an ounce or two in Sophie's favour. The past four
1059,--THOMAS TUSSER.,months had taught George better than to reply. The carriage road winding
1060,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"up the hill was his present keen interest. They set off to look at it,"
1061,--THOMAS TUSSER.,and the imported American scraper which had blighted the none too sunny
1062,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"soul of “Skim” Winsh, the carter."
1063,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1064,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"But young Iggulden was in charge now, and under his guidance, Buller and"
1065,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Roberts, the great horses, moved mountains."
1066,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1067,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“You lif' her like that, an' you tip her like that,” he explained to the"
1068,--THOMAS TUSSER.,gang. “My uncle he was roadmaster in Connecticut.”
1069,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1070,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Are they roads yonder?” said Skim, sitting under the laurels."
1071,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1072,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No better than accommodation roads. Dirt, they call 'em. They'd suit"
1073,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"you, Skim.”"
1074,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1075,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Why?” said the incautious Skim.
1076,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1077,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Cause you'd take no hurt when you fall out of your cart drunk on a
1078,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Saturday,” was the answer."
1079,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1080,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I didn't last time neither,” Skim roared."
1081,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1082,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"After the loud laugh, old Whybarne of Gale Anstey piped feebly, “Well,"
1083,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"dirt or no dirt, there's no denyin' Chapin knows a good job when he"
1084,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"sees it. 'E don't build one day and dee-stroy the next, like that nigger"
1085,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Sangres.”
1086,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1087,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“SHE's the one that knows her own mind,” said Pinky, brother to Skim"
1088,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Winsh, and a Napoleon among carters who had helped to bring the grand"
1089,--THOMAS TUSSER.,piano across the fields in the autumn rains.
1090,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1091,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“She had ought to,” said Iggulden. “Whoa, Buller! She's a Lashmar. They"
1092,--THOMAS TUSSER.,never was double-thinking.”
1093,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1094,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Oh, you found that? Has the answer come from your uncle?” said Skim,"
1095,--THOMAS TUSSER.,doubtful whether so remote a land as America had posts.
1096,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1097,--THOMAS TUSSER.,The others looked at him scornfully. Skim was always a day behind the
1098,--THOMAS TUSSER.,fair. Iggulden rested from his labours. “She's a Lashmar right enough.
1099,--THOMAS TUSSER.,I started up to write to my uncle--at once--the month after she said her
1100,--THOMAS TUSSER.,folks came from Veering Holler.”
1101,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1102,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Where there ain't any roads?” Skim interrupted, but none laughed."
1103,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1104,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“My uncle he married an American woman for his second, and she took"
1105,--THOMAS TUSSER.,it up like a—like the coroner. She's a Lashmar out of the old Lashmar
1106,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"place, 'fore they sold to Conants. She ain't no Toot Hill Lashmar, nor"
1107,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"any o' the Crayford lot. Her folk come out of the ground here, neither"
1108,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"chalk nor forest, but wildishers. They sailed over to America--I've got"
1109,--THOMAS TUSSER.,it all writ down by my uncle's woman--in eighteen hundred an' nothing.
1110,--THOMAS TUSSER.,My uncle says they're all slow begetters like.”
1111,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1112,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Would they be gentry yonder now?” Skim asked.
1113,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1114,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Nah--there's no gentry in America, no matter how long you're there."
1115,--THOMAS TUSSER.,It's against their law. There's only rich and poor allowed. They've
1116,--THOMAS TUSSER.,been lawyers and such like over yonder for a hundred years but she's a
1117,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Lashmar for all that.”
1118,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1119,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Lord! What's a hundred years?” said Whybarne, who had seen"
1120,--THOMAS TUSSER.,seventy-eight of them.
1121,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1122,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“An' they write too, from yonder--my uncle's woman writes--that you can"
1123,--THOMAS TUSSER.,still tell 'em by headmark. Their hair's foxy-red still--an' they throw
1124,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"out when they walk. He's in-toed-treads like a gipsy; but you watch, an'"
1125,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"you'll see 'er throw, out--like a colt.”"
1126,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1127,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Your trace wants taking up.” Pinky's large ears had caught the sound
1128,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of voices, and as the two broke through the laurels the men were hard at"
1129,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"work, their eyes on Sophie's feet."
1130,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1131,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"She had been less fortunate in her inquiries than Iggulden, for her Aunt"
1132,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Sydney of Meriden (a badged and certificated Daughter of the Revolution
1133,--THOMAS TUSSER.,to boot) answered her inquiries with a two-paged discourse on
1134,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"patriotism, the leaflets of a Village Improvement Society, of which she"
1135,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"was president, and a demand for an overdue subscription to a Factory"
1136,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Girls' Reading Circle. Sophie burned it all in the Orpheus and Eurydice
1137,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"grate, and kept her own counsel."
1138,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1139,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“What I want to know,” said George, when Spring was coming, and the"
1140,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"gardens needed thought, “is who will ever pay me for my labour? I've put"
1141,--THOMAS TUSSER.,in at least half a million dollars' worth already.”
1142,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1143,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Sure you're not taking too much out of yourself?” his wife asked.
1144,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1145,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Oh, no; I haven't been conscious of myself all winter.” He looked at"
1146,--THOMAS TUSSER.,his brown English gaiters and smiled. “It's all behind me now. I believe
1147,--THOMAS TUSSER.,I could sit down and think of all that--those months before we sailed.”
1148,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1149,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Don't--ah, don't!” she cried."
1150,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1151,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“But I must go back one day. You don't want to keep me out of business
1152,--THOMAS TUSSER.,always--or do you?” He ended with a nervous laugh.
1153,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1154,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Sophie sighed as she drew her own ground-ash (of old Iggulden's cutting)
1155,--THOMAS TUSSER.,from the hall rack.
1156,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1157,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Aren't you overdoing it too? You look a little tired,” he said."
1158,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1159,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“You make me tired. I'm going to Rocketts to see Mrs. Cloke about Mary.”
1160,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"(This was the sister of the telegraphist, promoted to be sewing-maid at"
1161,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Pardons.) “Coming?”
1162,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1163,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I'm due at Burnt House to see about the new well. By the way, there's a"
1164,--THOMAS TUSSER.,sore throat at Gale Anstey--”
1165,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1166,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“That's my province. Don't interfere. The Whybarne children always have
1167,--THOMAS TUSSER.,sore throats. They do it for jujubes.”
1168,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1169,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Keep away from Gale Anstey till I make sure, honey. Cloke ought to have"
1170,--THOMAS TUSSER.,told me.”
1171,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1172,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“These people don't tell. Haven't you learnt that yet? But I'll obey, me"
1173,--THOMAS TUSSER.,lord. See you later!”
1174,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1175,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"She set off afoot, for within the three main roads that bounded the"
1176,--THOMAS TUSSER.,blunt triangle of the estate (even by night one could scarcely hear the
1177,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"carts on them), wheels were not used except for farm work. The footpaths"
1178,--THOMAS TUSSER.,served all other purposes. And though at first they had planned
1179,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"improvements, they had soon fallen in with the customs of their hidden"
1180,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"kingdom, and moved about the soft-footed ways by woodland, hedgerow, and"
1181,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"shaw as freely as the rabbits. Indeed, for the most part Sophie walked"
1182,--THOMAS TUSSER.,bareheaded beneath her helmet of chestnut hair; but she had been plagued
1183,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of late by vague toothaches, which she explained to Mrs. Cloke, who"
1184,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"asked some questions. How it came about Sophie never knew, but after a"
1185,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"while behold Mrs. Cloke's arm was about her waist, and her head was on"
1186,--THOMAS TUSSER.,that deep bosom behind the shut kitchen door.
1187,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1188,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“My dear! My dear!” the elder woman almost sobbed. “An' d'you mean
1189,--THOMAS TUSSER.,to tell me you never suspicioned? Why--why--where was you ever taught
1190,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"anything at all? Of course it is. It's what we've been only waitin' for,"
1191,--THOMAS TUSSER.,all of us. Time and again I've said to Lady--” she checked herself. “An'
1192,--THOMAS TUSSER.,now we shall be as we should be.”
1193,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1194,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“But--but--but--” Sophie whimpered.
1195,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1196,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“An' to see you buildin' your nest so busy--pianos and books--an' never
1197,--THOMAS TUSSER.,thinkin' of a nursery!”
1198,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1199,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No more I did.” Sophie sat bolt upright, and began to laugh."
1200,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1201,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Time enough yet.” The fingers tapped thoughtfully on the broad knee.
1202,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“But--they must be strange-minded folk over yonder with you! Have you
1203,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"thought to send for your mother? She dead? My dear, my dear! Never"
1204,--THOMAS TUSSER.,mind! She'll be happy where she knows. 'Tis God's work. An' we was only
1205,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"waitin' for it, for you've never failed in your duty yet. It ain't"
1206,--THOMAS TUSSER.,your way. What did you say about my Mary's doings?” Mrs. Cloke's face
1207,--THOMAS TUSSER.,hardened as she pressed her chin on Sophie's forehead. “If any of your
1208,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"girls thinks to be'ave arbitrary now, I'll--But they won't, my dear."
1209,--THOMAS TUSSER.,I'll see they do their duty too. Be sure you'll 'ave no trouble.”
1210,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1211,--THOMAS TUSSER.,When Sophie walked back across the fields heaven and earth changed about
1212,--THOMAS TUSSER.,her as on the day of old Iggulden's death. For an instant she thought
1213,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"of the wide turn of the staircase, and the new ivory-white paint that"
1214,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"no coffin corner could scar, but presently, the shadow passed in a pure"
1215,--THOMAS TUSSER.,wonder and bewilderment that made her reel. She leaned against one of
1216,--THOMAS TUSSER.,their new gates and looked over their lands for some other stay.
1217,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1218,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Well,” she said resignedly, half aloud, “we must try to make him feel"
1219,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"that he isn't a third in our party,” and turned the corner that looked"
1220,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"over Friars Pardon, giddy, sick, and faint."
1221,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1222,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Of a sudden the house they had bought for a whim stood up as she had
1223,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"never seen it before, low-fronted, broad-winged, ample, prepared by"
1224,--THOMAS TUSSER.,course of generations for all such things. As it had steadied her when
1225,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"it lay desolate, so now that it had meaning from their few months of"
1226,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"life within, it soothed and promised good. She went alone and quickly"
1227,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"into the hall, and kissed either door-post, whispering: “Be good to me."
1228,--THOMAS TUSSER.,You know! You've never failed in your duty yet.”
1229,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1230,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"When the matter was explained to George, he would have sailed at once to"
1231,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"their own land, but this Sophie forbade."
1232,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1233,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I don't want science,” she said. “I just want to be loved, and there"
1234,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"isn't time for that at home. Besides,” she added, looking out of the"
1235,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"window, “it would be desertion.”"
1236,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1237,--THOMAS TUSSER.,George was forced to soothe himself with linking Friars Pardon to the
1238,--THOMAS TUSSER.,telegraph system of Great Britain by telephone--three-quarters of a
1239,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"mile of poles, put in by Whybarne and a few friends. One of these was"
1240,--THOMAS TUSSER.,a foreigner from the next parish. Said he when the line was being run:
1241,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“There's an old ellum right in our road. Shall us throw her?”
1242,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1243,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Toot Hill parish folk, neither grace nor good luck, God help 'em.” Old"
1244,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Whybarne shouted the local proverb from three poles down the line. “We
1245,--THOMAS TUSSER.,ain't goin' to lay any axe-iron to coffin-wood here not till we know
1246,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"where we are yet awhile. Swing round 'er, swing round!”"
1247,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1248,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"To this day, then, that sudden kink in the straight line across the"
1249,--THOMAS TUSSER.,upper pasture remains a mystery to Sophie and George. Nor can they tell
1250,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"why Skim Winsh, who came to his cottage under Dutton Shaw most musically"
1251,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"drunk at 10.45 P.M of every Saturday night, as his father had done"
1252,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"before him, sang no more at the bottom of the garden steps, where Sophie"
1253,--THOMAS TUSSER.,always feared he would break his neck. The path was undoubtedly an
1254,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"ancient right of way, and at 10.45 P.M. on Saturdays Skim remembered it"
1255,--THOMAS TUSSER.,was his duty to posterity to keep it open--till Mrs. Cloke spoke to him
1256,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"once. She spoke likewise to her daughter Mary, sewing maid at Pardons,"
1257,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"and to Mary's best new friend, the five-foot-seven imported London"
1258,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"house-maid, who taught Mary to trim hats, and found the country dullish."
1259,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1260,--THOMAS TUSSER.,But there was no noise--at no time was there any noise--and when Sophie
1261,--THOMAS TUSSER.,walked abroad she met no one in her path unless she had signified a wish
1262,--THOMAS TUSSER.,that way. Then they appeared to protest that all was well with them and
1263,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"their children, their chickens, their roofs, their water-supply, and"
1264,--THOMAS TUSSER.,their sons in the police or the railway service.
1265,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1266,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“But don't you find it dull, dear?” said George, loyally doing his best"
1267,--THOMAS TUSSER.,not to worry as the months went by.
1268,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1269,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I've been so busy putting my house in order I haven't had time to
1270,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"think,” said she. “Do you?”"
1271,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1272,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“No--no. If I could only be sure of you.”
1273,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1274,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"She turned on the green drawing-room's couch (it was Empire, not"
1275,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Heppelwhite after all), and laid aside a list of linen and blankets."
1276,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1277,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“It has changed everything, hasn't it?” she whispered."
1278,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1279,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Oh, Lord, yes. But I still think if we went back to Baltimore--”"
1280,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1281,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“And missed our first real summer together. No thank you, me lord.”"
1282,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1283,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“But we're absolutely alone.”
1284,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1285,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Isn't that what I'm doing my best to remedy? Don't you worry. I like
1286,--THOMAS TUSSER.,it--like it to the marrow of my little bones. You don't realize what her
1287,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"house means to a woman. We thought we were living in it last year, but"
1288,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"we hadn't begun to. Don't you rejoice in your study, George?”"
1289,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1290,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I prefer being here with you.” He sat down on the floor by the couch
1291,--THOMAS TUSSER.,and took her hand.
1292,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1293,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Seven,” she said, as the French clock struck. “Year before last you'd"
1294,--THOMAS TUSSER.,just be coming back from business.”
1295,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1296,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"He winced at the recollection, then laughed. “Business! I've been at"
1297,--THOMAS TUSSER.,work ten solid hours to-day.”
1298,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1299,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Where did you lunch? With the Conants?”
1300,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1301,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“No; at Dutton Shaw, sitting on a log, with my feet in a swamp. But"
1302,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"we've found out where the old spring is, and we're going to pipe it down"
1303,--THOMAS TUSSER.,to Gale Anstey next year.”
1304,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1305,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“I'll come and see to-morrow. Oh, please open the door, dear. I want to"
1306,--THOMAS TUSSER.,look down the passage. Isn't that corner by the stair-head lovely where
1307,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the sun strikes in?” She looked through half-closed eyes at the vista of
1308,--THOMAS TUSSER.,ivory-white and pale green all steeped in liquid gold.
1309,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1310,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“There's a step out of Jane Elphick's bedroom,” she went on--“and his"
1311,--THOMAS TUSSER.,first step in the world ought to be up. I shouldn't wonder if those
1312,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"people hadn't put it there on purpose. George, will it make any odds to"
1313,--THOMAS TUSSER.,you if he's a girl?”
1314,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1315,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"He answered, as he had many times before, that his interest was his"
1316,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"wife, not the child."
1317,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1318,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Then you're the only person who thinks so.” She laughed. “Don't be
1319,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"silly, dear. It's expected. I know. It's my duty. I shan't be able to"
1320,--THOMAS TUSSER.,look our people in the face if I fail.”
1321,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1322,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“What concern is it of theirs, confound 'em!”"
1323,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1324,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“You'll see. Luckily the tradition of the house is boys, Mrs. Cloke"
1325,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"says, so I'm provided for. Shall you ever begin to understand these"
1326,--THOMAS TUSSER.,people? I shan't.”
1327,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1328,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“And we bought it for fun--for fun!” he groaned. “And here we are held
1329,--THOMAS TUSSER.,up for goodness knows how long!”
1330,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1331,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“Why? Were you thinking of selling it?” He did not answer. “Do you
1332,--THOMAS TUSSER.,remember the second Mrs. Chapin?” she demanded.
1333,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1334,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"This was a bold, brazen little black-browed woman--a widow for"
1335,--THOMAS TUSSER.,choice--who on Sophie's death was guilefully to marry George for his
1336,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"wealth and ruin him in a year. George being busy, Sophie had invented"
1337,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"her some two years after her marriage, and conceived she was alone among"
1338,--THOMAS TUSSER.,wives in so doing.
1339,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1340,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“You aren't going to bring her up again?” he asked anxiously.
1341,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1342,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“I only want to say that I should hate any one who bought Pardons ten
1343,--THOMAS TUSSER.,times worse than I used to hate the second Mrs. Chapin. Think what we've
1344,--THOMAS TUSSER.,put into it of our two selves.”
1345,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1346,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“At least a couple of million dollars. I know I could have made--” He
1347,--THOMAS TUSSER.,broke off.
1348,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1349,--THOMAS TUSSER.,“The beasts!” she went on. “They'd be sure to build a red-brick lodge
1350,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"at the gates, and cut the lawn up for bedding out. You must leave"
1351,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"instructions in your will that he's never to do that, George, won't"
1352,--THOMAS TUSSER.,you?”
1353,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1354,--THOMAS TUSSER.,He laughed and took her hand again but said nothing till it was time to
1355,--THOMAS TUSSER.,dress. Then he muttered: “What the devil use is a man's country to him
1356,--THOMAS TUSSER.,when he can't do business in it?”
1357,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1358,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Friars Pardon stood faithful to its tradition. At the appointed time was
1359,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"born, not that third in their party to whom Sophie meant to be so kind,"
1360,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"but a godling; in beauty, it was manifest, excelling Eros, as in wisdom"
1361,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Confucius; an enhancer of delights, a renewer of companionships and an"
1362,--THOMAS TUSSER.,interpreter of Destiny. This last George did not realise till he met
1363,--THOMAS TUSSER.,Lady Conant striding through Dutton Shaw a few days after the event.
1364,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1365,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“My dear fellow,” she cried, and slapped him heartily on the back, “I"
1366,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"can't tell you how glad we all are. Oh, she'll be all right. (There's"
1367,--THOMAS TUSSER.,never been any trouble over the birth of an heir at Pardons.) Now where
1368,--THOMAS TUSSER.,the dooce is it?” She felt largely in her leather-boundskirt and drew
1369,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"out a small silver mug. “I sent a note to your wife about it, but my"
1370,--THOMAS TUSSER.,silly ass of a groom forgot to take this. You can save me a tramp. Give
1371,--THOMAS TUSSER.,her my love.” She marched off amid her guard of grave Airedales.
1372,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1373,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"The mug was worn and dented: above the twined initials, G.L., was the"
1374,--THOMAS TUSSER.,crest of a footless bird and the motto: “Wayte awhyle--wayte awhyle.”
1375,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1376,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“That's the other end of the riddle,” Sophie whispered, when he saw her"
1377,--THOMAS TUSSER.,that evening. “Read her note. The English write beautiful notes.”
1378,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1379,--THOMAS TUSSER.,The warmest of welcomes to your little man. I hope he will appreciate
1380,--THOMAS TUSSER.,his native land now he has come to it. Though you have said nothing we
1381,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"cannot, of course, look on him as a little stranger, and so I am sending"
1382,--THOMAS TUSSER.,him the old Lashmar christening mug. It has been with us since Gregory
1383,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Lashmar, your great-grandmother's brother--"
1384,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1385,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1386,--THOMAS TUSSER.,George stared at his wife.
1387,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1388,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"“Go on,” she twinkled, from the pillows."
1389,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1390,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"--mother's brother, sold his place to Walter's family. We seem to have"
1391,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"acquired some of your household gods at that time, but nothing survives"
1392,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"except the mug and the old cradle, which I found in the potting-shed and"
1393,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"am having put in order for you. I hope little George--Lashmar, he will"
1394,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"be too, won't he?--will live to see his grandchildren cut their teeth on"

1396,--THOMAS TUSSER.,
1397,--THOMAS TUSSER.,"Affectionately yours,"
1398,ALICE CONANT.,ALICE CONANT.
1399,ALICE CONANT.,
1400,ALICE CONANT.,P.S.--How quiet you've kept about it all!
1401,ALICE CONANT.,
1402,ALICE CONANT.,"“Well, I'm--”"
1403,ALICE CONANT.,
1404,ALICE CONANT.,"“Don't swear,” said Sophie. “Bad for the infant mind.”"
1405,ALICE CONANT.,
1406,ALICE CONANT.,“But how in the world did she get at it? Have you ever said a word about
1407,ALICE CONANT.,the Lashmars?”
1408,ALICE CONANT.,
1409,ALICE CONANT.,“You know the only time--to young Iggulden at Rocketts--when Iggulden
1410,ALICE CONANT.,died.”
1411,ALICE CONANT.,
1412,ALICE CONANT.,“Your great-grandmother's brother! She's traced the whole
1413,ALICE CONANT.,connection--more than your Aunt Sydney could do. What does she mean
1414,ALICE CONANT.,about our keeping quiet?”
1415,ALICE CONANT.,
1416,ALICE CONANT.,Sophie's eyes sparkled. “I've thought that out too. We've got back at
1417,ALICE CONANT.,the English at last. Can't you see that she thought that we thought my
1418,ALICE CONANT.,mother's being a Lashmar was one of those things we'd expect the English
1419,ALICE CONANT.,"to find out for themselves, and that's impressed her?” She turned"
1420,ALICE CONANT.,"the mug in her white hands, and sighed happily. “'Wayte awhyle--wayte"
1421,ALICE CONANT.,"awhyle.' That's not a bad motto, George. It's been worth it.”"
1422,ALICE CONANT.,
1423,ALICE CONANT.,“But still I don't quite see--”
1424,ALICE CONANT.,
1425,ALICE CONANT.,“I shouldn't wonder if they don't think our coming here was part of a
1426,ALICE CONANT.,deep-laid scheme to be near our ancestors. They'd understand that. And
1427,ALICE CONANT.,"look how they've accepted us, all of them.”"
1428,ALICE CONANT.,
1429,ALICE CONANT.,“Are we so undesirable in ourselves?” George grunted.
1430,ALICE CONANT.,
1431,ALICE CONANT.,"“Be just, me lord. That wretched Sangres man has twice our money. Can"
1432,ALICE CONANT.,you see Marm Conant slapping him between the shoulders? Not by a jugful!
1433,ALICE CONANT.,The poor beast doesn't exist!”
1434,ALICE CONANT.,
1435,ALICE CONANT.,“Do you think it's that then?” He looked toward the cot by the fire
1436,ALICE CONANT.,where the godling snorted.
1437,ALICE CONANT.,
1438,ALICE CONANT.,“The minute I get well I shall find out from Mrs. Cloke what every
1439,ALICE CONANT.,Lashmar gives in doles (that's nicer than tips) every time a Lashmite is
1440,ALICE CONANT.,"born. I've done my duty thus far, but there's much expected of me.”"
1441,ALICE CONANT.,
1442,ALICE CONANT.,"Entered here Mrs. Cloke, and hung worshipping over the cot. They showed"
1443,ALICE CONANT.,"her the mug and her face shone. “Oh, now Lady Conant's sent it, it'll"
1444,ALICE CONANT.,"be all proper, ma'am, won't it? 'George' of course he'd have to be, but"
1445,ALICE CONANT.,seein' what he is we was hopin'--all your people was hopin'--it 'ud be
1446,ALICE CONANT.,"'Lashmar' too, and that'ud just round it out. A very 'andsome mug quite"
1447,ALICE CONANT.,"unique, I should imagine. 'Wayte awhyle--wayte awhyle.' That's true with"
1448,ALICE CONANT.,"the Lashmars, I've heard. Very slow to fill their houses, they are. Most"
1449,ALICE CONANT.,like Master George won't open 'is nursery till he's thirty.”
1450,ALICE CONANT.,
1451,ALICE CONANT.,“Poor lamb!” cried Sophie. “But how did you know my folk were Lashmars?”
1452,ALICE CONANT.,
1453,ALICE CONANT.,"Mrs. Cloke thought deeply. “I'm sure I can't quite say, ma'am, but I've"
1454,ALICE CONANT.,a belief likely that it was something you may have let drop to young
1455,ALICE CONANT.,Iggulden when you was at Rocketts. That may have been what give us an
1456,ALICE CONANT.,"inkling. An' so it came out, one thing in the way o' talk leading to"
1457,ALICE CONANT.,"another, and those American people at Veering Holler was very obligin'"
1458,ALICE CONANT.,"with news, I'm told, ma'am.”"
1459,ALICE CONANT.,
1460,ALICE CONANT.,"“Great Scott!” said George, under his breath. “And this is the simple"
1461,ALICE CONANT.,peasant!”
1462,ALICE CONANT.,
1463,ALICE CONANT.,"“Yiss,” Mrs. Cloke went on. “An' Cloke was only wonderin' this"
1464,ALICE CONANT.,"afternoon--your pillow's slipped my dear, you mustn't lie that"
1465,ALICE CONANT.,"a-way--just for the sake o' sayin' something, whether you wouldn't think"
1466,ALICE CONANT.,"well now of getting the Lashmar farms back, sir. They don't rightly"
1467,ALICE CONANT.,"round off Sir Walter's estate. They come caterin' across us more. Cloke,"
1468,ALICE CONANT.,'e 'ud be glad to show you over any day.”
1469,ALICE CONANT.,
1470,ALICE CONANT.,"“But Sir Walter doesn't want to sell, does he?”"
1471,ALICE CONANT.,
1472,ALICE CONANT.,"“We can find out from his bailiff, sir, but”--with cold contempt--“I"
1473,ALICE CONANT.,"think that trained nurse is just comin' up from her dinner, so 'm afraid"
1474,ALICE CONANT.,"we'll 'ave to ask you, sir... Now, Master George--Ai-ie! Wake a litty"
1475,ALICE CONANT.,"minute, lammie!”"
1476,ALICE CONANT.,
1477,ALICE CONANT.,A few months later the three of them were down at the brook in the Gale
1478,ALICE CONANT.,Anstey woods to consider the rebuilding of a footbridge carried away by
1479,ALICE CONANT.,spring floods. George Lashmar Chapin wanted all the bluebells on God's
1480,ALICE CONANT.,"earth that day to eat, and Sophie adored him in a voice like to the"
1481,ALICE CONANT.,cooing of a dove; so business was delayed.
1482,ALICE CONANT.,
1483,ALICE CONANT.,"“Here's the place,” said his father at last among the water"
1484,ALICE CONANT.,"forget-me-nots. “But where the deuce are the larch-poles, Cloke? I told"
1485,ALICE CONANT.,you to have them down here ready.”
1486,ALICE CONANT.,
1487,ALICE CONANT.,"“We'll get 'em down _if_ you say so,” Cloke answered, with a thrust of"
1488,ALICE CONANT.,the underlip they both knew.
1489,ALICE CONANT.,
1490,ALICE CONANT.,“But I did say so. What on earth have you brought that timber-tug here
1491,ALICE CONANT.,"for? We aren't building a railway bridge. Why, in America, half-a-dozen"
1492,ALICE CONANT.,two-by-four bits would be ample.”
1493,ALICE CONANT.,
1494,ALICE CONANT.,"“I don't know nothin' about that,” said Cloke."
1495,ALICE CONANT.,
1496,ALICE CONANT.,“An' I've nothin' to say against larch--IF you want to make a temp'ry
1497,ALICE CONANT.,"job of it. I ain't 'ere to tell you what isn't so, sir; an' you can't"
1498,ALICE CONANT.,"say I ever come creepin' up on you, or tryin' to lead you further in"
1499,ALICE CONANT.,than you set out--”
1500,ALICE CONANT.,
1501,ALICE CONANT.,A year ago George would have danced with impatience. Now he scraped a
1502,ALICE CONANT.,"little mud off his old gaiters with his spud, and waited."
1503,ALICE CONANT.,
1504,ALICE CONANT.,“All I say is that you can put up larch and make a temp'ry job of it;
1505,ALICE CONANT.,and by the time the young master's married it'll have to be done again.
1506,ALICE CONANT.,"Now, I've brought down a couple of as sweet six-by-eight oak timbers"
1507,ALICE CONANT.,as we've ever drawed. You put 'em in an' it's off your mind for good an'
1508,ALICE CONANT.,"all. T'other way--I don't say it ain't right, I'm only just sayin' what"
1509,ALICE CONANT.,"I think--but t'other way, he'll no sooner be married than we'll 'ave it"
1510,ALICE CONANT.,"_all_ to do again. You've no call to regard my words, but you can't get"
1511,ALICE CONANT.,out of that.”
1512,ALICE CONANT.,
1513,ALICE CONANT.,"“No,” said George after a pause; “I've been realising that for some"
1514,ALICE CONANT.,time. Make it oak then; we can't get out of it.”

1550,GARM--A HOSTAGE,GARM--A HOSTAGE
1551,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1552,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"One night, a very long time ago, I drove to an Indian military"
1553,GARM--A HOSTAGE,cantonment called Mian Mir to see amateur theatricals. At the back of
1554,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the Infantry barracks a soldier, his cap over one eye, rushed in front"
1555,GARM--A HOSTAGE,of the horses and shouted that he was a dangerous highway robber. As a
1556,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"matter of fact, he was a friend of mine, so I told him to go home before"
1557,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"any one caught him; but he fell under the pole, and I heard voices of a"
1558,GARM--A HOSTAGE,military guard in search of some one.
1559,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1560,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"The driver and I coaxed him into the carriage, drove home swiftly,"
1561,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"undressed him and put him to bed, where he waked next morning with"
1562,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"a sore headache, very much ashamed. When his uniform was cleaned and"
1563,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"dried, and he had been shaved and washed and made neat, I drove him back"
1564,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"to barracks with his arm in a fine white sling, and reported that I"
1565,GARM--A HOSTAGE,had accidentally run over him. I did not tell this story to my
1566,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"friend's sergeant, who was a hostile and unbelieving person, but to his"
1567,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"lieutenant, who did not know us quite so well."
1568,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1569,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Three days later my friend came to call, and at his heels slobbered and"
1570,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"fawned one of the finest bull-terriers--of the old-fashioned breed, two"
1571,GARM--A HOSTAGE,parts bull and one terrier--that I had ever set eyes on. He was pure
1572,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"white, with a fawn-coloured saddle just behind his neck, and a fawn"
1573,GARM--A HOSTAGE,diamond at the root of his thin whippy tail. I had admired him distantly
1574,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"for more than a year; and Vixen, my own fox-terrier, knew him too, but"
1575,GARM--A HOSTAGE,did not approve.
1576,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1577,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“'E's for you,” said my friend; but he did not look as though he liked"
1578,GARM--A HOSTAGE,parting with him.
1579,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1580,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Nonsense! That dog's worth more than most men, Stanley,” I said."
1581,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1582,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“'E's that and more. 'Tention!”
1583,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1584,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"The dog rose on his hind legs, and stood upright for a full minute."
1585,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1586,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“Eyes right!”
1587,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1588,GARM--A HOSTAGE,He sat on his haunches and turned his head sharp to the right. At a sign
1589,GARM--A HOSTAGE,he rose and barked thrice. Then he shook hands with his right paw and
1590,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"bounded lightly to my shoulder. Here he made himself into a necktie,"
1591,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"limp and lifeless, hanging down on either side of my neck. I was told to"
1592,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"pick him up and throw him in the air. He fell with a howl, and held up"
1593,GARM--A HOSTAGE,one leg.
1594,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1595,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Part o' the trick,” said his owner. “You're going to die now. Dig"
1596,GARM--A HOSTAGE,yourself your little grave an' shut your little eye.”
1597,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1598,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Still limping, the dog hobbled to the garden-edge, dug a hole and lay"
1599,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"down in it. When told that he was cured, he jumped out, wagging his"
1600,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"tail, and whining for applause. He was put through half-a-dozen other"
1601,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"tricks, such as showing how he would hold a man safe (I was that man,"
1602,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"and he sat down before me, his teeth bared, ready to spring), and how"
1603,GARM--A HOSTAGE,he would stop eating at the word of command. I had no more than finished
1604,GARM--A HOSTAGE,praising him when my friend made a gesture that stopped the dog as
1605,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"though he had been shot, took a piece of blue-ruled canteen-paper from"
1606,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"his helmet, handed it to me and ran away, while the dog looked after him"
1607,GARM--A HOSTAGE,and howled. I read:
1608,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1609,GARM--A HOSTAGE,SIR--I give you the dog because of what you got me out of. He is the
1610,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"best I know, for I made him myself, and he is as good as a man. Please"
1611,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"do not give him too much to eat, and please do not give him back to me,"
1612,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"for I'm not going to take him, if you will keep him. So please do not"
1613,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"try to give him back any more. I have kept his name back, so you can"
1614,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"call him anything and he will answer, but please do not give him back."
1615,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"He can kill a man as easy as anything, but please do not give him too"
1616,GARM--A HOSTAGE,much meat. He knows more than a man.
1617,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1618,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Vixen sympathetically joined her shrill little yap to the bull-terrier's
1619,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"despairing cry, and I was annoyed, for I knew that a man who cares for"
1620,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"dogs is one thing, but a man who loves one dog is quite another. Dogs"
1621,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"are at the best no more than verminous vagrants, self-scratchers, foul"
1622,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"feeders, and unclean by the law of Moses and Mohammed; but a dog with"
1623,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"whom one lives alone for at least six months in the year; a free thing,"
1624,GARM--A HOSTAGE,tied to you so strictly by love that without you he will not stir or
1625,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"exercise; a patient, temperate, humorous, wise soul, who knows your"
1626,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"moods before you know them yourself, is not a dog under any ruling."
1627,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1628,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I had Vixen, who was all my dog to me; and I felt what my friend must"
1629,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"have felt, at tearing out his heart in this style and leaving it in"
1630,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"my garden. However, the dog understood clearly enough that I was his"
1631,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"master, and did not follow the soldier. As soon as he drew breath I made"
1632,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"much of him, and Vixen, yelling with jealousy, flew at him. Had she been"
1633,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"of his own sex, he might have cheered himself with a fight, but he only"
1634,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"looked worriedly when she nipped his deep iron sides, laid his heavy"
1635,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"head on my knee, and howled anew. I meant to dine at the Club that"
1636,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"night; but as darkness drew in, and the dog snuffed through the empty"
1637,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"house like a child trying to recover from a fit of sobbing, I felt that"
1638,GARM--A HOSTAGE,I could not leave him to suffer his first evening alone. So we fed at
1639,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"home, Vixen on one side, and the stranger-dog on the other; she watching"
1640,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"his every mouthful, and saying explicitly what she thought of his table"
1641,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"manners, which were much better than hers."
1642,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1643,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"It was Vixen's custom, till the weather grew hot, to sleep in my bed,"
1644,GARM--A HOSTAGE,her head on the pillow like a Christian; and when morning came I would
1645,GARM--A HOSTAGE,always find that the little thing had braced her feet against the wall
1646,GARM--A HOSTAGE,and pushed me to the very edge of the cot. This night she hurried to bed
1647,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"purposefully, every hair up, one eye on the stranger, who had dropped"
1648,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"on a mat in a helpless, hopeless sort of way, all four feet spread out,"
1649,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"sighing heavily. She settled her head on the pillow several times,"
1650,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"to show her little airs and graces, and struck up her usual whiney"
1651,GARM--A HOSTAGE,sing-song before slumber. The stranger-dog softly edged toward me. I
1652,GARM--A HOSTAGE,put out my hand and he licked it. Instantly my wrist was between Vixen's
1653,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"teeth, and her warning aaarh! said as plainly as speech, that if I took"
1654,GARM--A HOSTAGE,any further notice of the stranger she would bite.
1655,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1656,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I caught her behind her fat neck with my left hand, shook her severely,"
1657,GARM--A HOSTAGE,and said:
1658,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1659,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Vixen, if you do that again you'll be put into the verandah. Now,"
1660,GARM--A HOSTAGE,remember!”
1661,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1662,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"She understood perfectly, but the minute I released her she mouthed my"
1663,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"right wrist once more, and waited with her ears back and all her body"
1664,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"flattened, ready to bite. The big dog's tail thumped the floor in a"
1665,GARM--A HOSTAGE,humble and peace-making way.
1666,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1667,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I grabbed Vixen a second time, lifted her out of bed like a rabbit"
1668,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"(she hated that and yelled), and, as I had promised, set her out in the"
1669,GARM--A HOSTAGE,verandah with the bats and the moonlight. At this she howled. Then
1670,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"she used coarse language--not to me, but to the bull-terrier--till she"
1671,GARM--A HOSTAGE,coughed with exhaustion. Then she ran round the house trying every door.
1672,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Then she went off to the stables and barked as though some one were
1673,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"stealing the horses, which was an old trick of hers. Last she returned,"
1674,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"and her snuffing yelp said, “I'll be good! Let me in and I'll be good!”"
1675,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1676,GARM--A HOSTAGE,She was admitted and flew to her pillow. When she was quieted I
1677,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"whispered to the other dog, “You can lie on the foot of the bed.” The"
1678,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"bull jumped up at once, and though I felt Vixen quiver with rage, she"
1679,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"knew better than to protest. So we slept till the morning, and they had"
1680,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"early breakfast with me, bite for bite, till the horse came round and"
1681,GARM--A HOSTAGE,we went for a ride. I don't think the bull had ever followed a horse
1682,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"before. He was wild with excitement, and Vixen, as usual, squealed and"
1683,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"scuttered and scooted, and took charge of the procession."
1684,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1685,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"There was one corner of a village near by, which we generally passed"
1686,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"with caution, because all the yellow pariah-dogs of the place gathered"
1687,GARM--A HOSTAGE,about it.
1688,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1689,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"They were half-wild, starving beasts, and though utter cowards, yet"
1690,GARM--A HOSTAGE,where nine or ten of them get together they will mob and kill and eat an
1691,GARM--A HOSTAGE,English dog. I kept a whip with a long lash for them.
1692,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1693,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"That morning they attacked Vixen, who, perhaps of design, had moved from"
1694,GARM--A HOSTAGE,beyond my horse's shadow.
1695,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1696,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"The bull was ploughing along in the dust, fifty yards behind, rolling in"
1697,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"his run, and smiling as bull-terriers will. I heard Vixen squeal; half a"
1698,GARM--A HOSTAGE,dozen of the curs closed in on her; a white streak came up behind me;
1699,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"a cloud of dust rose near Vixen, and, when it cleared, I saw one tall"
1700,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"pariah with his back broken, and the bull wrenching another to earth."
1701,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Vixen retreated to the protection of my whip, and the bull paddled back"
1702,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"smiling more than ever, covered with the blood of his enemies. That"
1703,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"decided me to call him “Garm of the Bloody Breast,” who was a great"
1704,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"person in his time, or “Garm” for short; so, leaning forward, I told him"
1705,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"what his temporary name would be. He looked up while I repeated it, and"
1706,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"then raced away. I shouted “Garm!” He stopped, raced back, and came up"
1707,GARM--A HOSTAGE,to ask my will.
1708,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1709,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Then I saw that my soldier friend was right, and that that dog knew and"
1710,GARM--A HOSTAGE,was worth more than a man. At the end of the ride I gave an order which
1711,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Vixen knew and hated: “Go away and get washed!” I said. Garm understood
1712,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"some part of it, and Vixen interpreted the rest, and the two trotted off"
1713,GARM--A HOSTAGE,together soberly. When I went to the back verandah Vixen had been washed
1714,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"snowy-white, and was very proud of herself, but the dog-boy would not"
1715,GARM--A HOSTAGE,touch Garm on any account unless I stood by. So I waited while he was
1716,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"being scrubbed, and Garm, with the soap creaming on the top of his broad"
1717,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"head, looked at me to make sure that this was what I expected him to"
1718,GARM--A HOSTAGE,endure. He knew perfectly that the dog-boy was only obeying orders.
1719,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1720,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Another time,” I said to the dog-boy, “you will wash the great dog with"
1721,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Vixen when I send them home.”
1722,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1723,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Does he know?” said the dog-boy, who understood the ways of dogs."
1724,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1725,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Garm,” I said, “another time you will be washed with Vixen.”"
1726,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1727,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I knew that Garm understood. Indeed, next washing-day, when Vixen as"
1728,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"usual fled under my bed, Garm stared at the doubtful dog-boy in the"
1729,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"verandah, stalked to the place where he had been washed last time, and"
1730,GARM--A HOSTAGE,stood rigid in the tub.
1731,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1732,GARM--A HOSTAGE,But the long days in my office tried him sorely. We three would drive
1733,GARM--A HOSTAGE,off in the morning at half-past eight and come home at six or later.
1734,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Vixen knowing the routine of it, went to sleep under my table; but"
1735,GARM--A HOSTAGE,the confinement ate into Garm's soul. He generally sat on the verandah
1736,GARM--A HOSTAGE,looking out on the Mall; and well I knew what he expected.
1737,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1738,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Sometimes a company of soldiers would move along on their way to the
1739,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Fort, and Garm rolled forth to inspect them; or an officer in uniform"
1740,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"entered into the office, and it was pitiful to see poor Garm's welcome"
1741,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"to the cloth--not the man. He would leap at him, and sniff and bark"
1742,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"joyously, then run to the door and back again. One afternoon I heard"
1743,GARM--A HOSTAGE,him bay with a full throat--a thing I had never heard before--and he
1744,GARM--A HOSTAGE,disappeared. When I drove into my garden at the end of the day a soldier
1745,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"in white uniform scrambled over the wall at the far end, and the Garm"
1746,GARM--A HOSTAGE,that met me was a joyous dog. This happened twice or thrice a week for a
1747,GARM--A HOSTAGE,month.
1748,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1749,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I pretended not to notice, but Garm knew and Vixen knew. He would glide"
1750,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"homewards from the office about four o'clock, as though he were only"
1751,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"going to look at the scenery, and this he did so quietly that but for"
1752,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Vixen I should not have noticed him. The jealous little dog under
1753,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the table would give a sniff and a snort, just loud enough to call my"
1754,GARM--A HOSTAGE,attention to the flight. Garm might go out forty times in the day and
1755,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Vixen would never stir, but when he slunk off to see his true master in"
1756,GARM--A HOSTAGE,my garden she told me in her own tongue. That was the one sign she made
1757,GARM--A HOSTAGE,to prove that Garm did not altogether belong to the family. They were
1758,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the best of friends at all times, but, Vixen explained that I was never"
1759,GARM--A HOSTAGE,to forget Garm did not love me as she loved me.
1760,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1761,GARM--A HOSTAGE,I never expected it. The dog was not my dog—could never be my dog--and I
1762,GARM--A HOSTAGE,knew he was as miserable as his master who tramped eight miles a day to
1763,GARM--A HOSTAGE,see him. So it seemed to me that the sooner the two were reunited the
1764,GARM--A HOSTAGE,better for all. One afternoon I sent Vixen home alone in the dog-cart
1765,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"(Garm had gone before), and rode over to cantonments to find another"
1766,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"friend of mine, who was an Irish soldier and a great friend of the dog's"
1767,GARM--A HOSTAGE,master.
1768,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1769,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I explained the whole case, and wound up with:"
1770,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1771,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“And now Stanley's in my garden crying over his dog. Why doesn't he take
1772,GARM--A HOSTAGE,him back? They're both unhappy.”
1773,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1774,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“Unhappy! There's no sense in the little man any more. But 'tis his
1775,GARM--A HOSTAGE,fit.”
1776,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1777,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“What is his fit? He travels fifty miles a week to see the brute, and"
1778,GARM--A HOSTAGE,he pretends not to notice me when he sees me on the road; and I'm as
1779,GARM--A HOSTAGE,unhappy as he is. Make him take the dog back.”
1780,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1781,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“It's his penance he's set himself. I told him by way of a joke, afther"
1782,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"you'd run over him so convenient that night, whin he was drunk--I said"
1783,GARM--A HOSTAGE,if he was a Catholic he'd do penance. Off he went wid that fit in his
1784,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"little head an' a dose of fever, an nothin' would suit but givin' you"
1785,GARM--A HOSTAGE,the dog as a hostage.”
1786,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1787,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“Hostage for what? I don't want hostages from Stanley.”
1788,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1789,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“For his good behaviour. He's keepin' straight now, the way it's no"
1790,GARM--A HOSTAGE,pleasure to associate wid him.”
1791,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1792,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“Has he taken the pledge?”
1793,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1794,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“If 'twas only that I need not care. Ye can take the pledge for three
1795,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"months on an' off. He sez he'll never see the dog again, an' so mark"
1796,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"you, he'll keep straight for evermore. Ye know his fits? Well, this is"
1797,GARM--A HOSTAGE,wan of them. How's the dog takin' it?”
1798,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1799,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“Like a man. He's the best dog in India. Can't you make Stanley take him
1800,GARM--A HOSTAGE,back?”
1801,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1802,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“I can do no more than I have done. But ye know his fits. He's just
1803,GARM--A HOSTAGE,doin' his penance. What will he do when he goes to the Hills? The
1804,GARM--A HOSTAGE,doctor's put him on the list.”
1805,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1806,GARM--A HOSTAGE,It is the custom in India to send a certain number of invalids from each
1807,GARM--A HOSTAGE,regiment up to stations in the Himalayas for the hot weather; and though
1808,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the men ought to enjoy the cool and the comfort, they miss the society"
1809,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"of the barracks down below, and do their best to come back or to avoid"
1810,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"going. I felt that this move would bring matters to a head, so I left"
1811,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Terrence hopefully, though he called after me “He won't take the dog,"
1812,GARM--A HOSTAGE,sorr. You can lay your month's pay on that. Ye know his fits.”
1813,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1814,GARM--A HOSTAGE,I never pretended to understand Private Ortheris; and so I did the next
1815,GARM--A HOSTAGE,best thing—I left him alone.
1816,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1817,GARM--A HOSTAGE,That summer the invalids of the regiment to which my friend belonged
1818,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"were ordered off to the Hills early, because the doctors thought"
1819,GARM--A HOSTAGE,marching in the cool of the day would do them good. Their route lay
1820,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"south to a place called Umballa, a hundred and twenty miles or more."
1821,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Then they would turn east and march up into the hills to Kasauli or
1822,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Dugshai or Subathoo. I dined with the officers the night before they
1823,GARM--A HOSTAGE,left--they were marching at five in the morning. It was midnight when I
1824,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"drove into my garden, and surprised a white figure flying over the wall."
1825,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1826,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“That man,” said my butler, “has been here since nine, making talk to"
1827,GARM--A HOSTAGE,that dog. He is quite mad.”
1828,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1829,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“I did not tell him to go away because he has been here many times
1830,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"before, and because the dog-boy told me that if I told him to go away,"
1831,GARM--A HOSTAGE,that great dog would immediately slay me. He did not wish to speak to
1832,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the Protector of the Poor, and he did not ask for anything to eat or"
1833,GARM--A HOSTAGE,drink.”
1834,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1835,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Kadir Buksh,” said I, “that was well done, for the dog would surely"
1836,GARM--A HOSTAGE,have killed thee. But I do not think the white soldier will come any
1837,GARM--A HOSTAGE,more.”
1838,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1839,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Garm slept ill that night and whimpered in his dreams. Once he sprang up
1840,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"with a clear, ringing bark, and I heard him wag his tail till it waked"
1841,GARM--A HOSTAGE,him and the bark died out in a howl. He had dreamed he was with his
1842,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"master again, and I nearly cried. It was all Stanley's silly fault."
1843,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1844,GARM--A HOSTAGE,The first halt which the detachment of invalids made was some miles
1845,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"from their barracks, on the Amritsar road, and ten miles distant from my"
1846,GARM--A HOSTAGE,house. By a mere chance one of the officers drove back for another good
1847,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"dinner at the Club (cooking on the line of march is always bad), and"
1848,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"there I met him. He was a particular friend of mine, and I knew that he"
1849,GARM--A HOSTAGE,knew how to love a dog properly. His pet was a big fat retriever who was
1850,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"going up to the Hills for his health, and, though it was still April,"
1851,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the round, brown brute puffed and panted in the Club verandah as though"
1852,GARM--A HOSTAGE,he would burst.
1853,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1854,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“It's amazing,” said the officer, “what excuses these invalids of mine"
1855,GARM--A HOSTAGE,make to get back to barracks. There's a man in my company now asked me
1856,GARM--A HOSTAGE,for leave to go back to cantonments to pay a debt he'd forgotten. I
1857,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"was so taken by the idea I let him go, and he jingled off in an ekka as"
1858,GARM--A HOSTAGE,pleased as Punch. Ten miles to pay a debt! Wonder what it was really?”
1859,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1860,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“If you'll drive me home I think I can show you,” I said."
1861,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1862,GARM--A HOSTAGE,So he went over to my house in his dog-cart with the retriever; and on
1863,GARM--A HOSTAGE,the way I told him the story of Garm.
1864,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1865,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“I was wondering where that brute had gone to. He's the best dog in the
1866,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"regiment,” said my friend. “I offered the little fellow twenty rupees"
1867,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"for him a month ago. But he's a hostage, you say, for Stanley's good"
1868,GARM--A HOSTAGE,conduct. Stanley's one of the best men I have when he chooses.”
1869,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1870,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“That's the reason why,” I said. “A second-rate man wouldn't have taken"
1871,GARM--A HOSTAGE,things to heart as he has done.”
1872,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1873,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"We drove in quietly at the far end of the garden, and crept round the"
1874,GARM--A HOSTAGE,house. There was a place close to the wall all grown about with tamarisk
1875,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"trees, where I knew Garm kept his bones. Even Vixen was not allowed to"
1876,GARM--A HOSTAGE,sit near it. In the full Indian moonlight I could see a white uniform
1877,GARM--A HOSTAGE,bending over the dog.
1878,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1879,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Good-bye, old man,” we could not help hearing Stanley's voice. “For"
1880,GARM--A HOSTAGE,'Eving's sake don't get bit and go mad by any measley pi-dog. But you can
1881,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"look after yourself, old man. You don't get drunk an' run about 'ittin'"
1882,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"your friends. You takes your bones an' you eats your biscuit, an' you"
1883,GARM--A HOSTAGE,kills your enemy like a gentleman. I'm goin' away--don't 'owl--I'm goin'
1884,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"off to Kasauli, where I won't see you no more.”"
1885,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1886,GARM--A HOSTAGE,I could hear him holding Garm's nose as the dog threw it up to the
1887,GARM--A HOSTAGE,stars.
1888,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1889,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“You'll stay here an' be'ave, an'--an' I'll go away an' try to be'ave,"
1890,GARM--A HOSTAGE,an' I don't know 'ow to leave you. I don't know--”
1891,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1892,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“I think this is damn silly,” said the officer, patting his foolish"
1893,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"fubsy old retriever. He called to the private, who leaped to his feet,"
1894,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"marched forward, and saluted."
1895,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1896,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“You here?” said the officer, turning away his head."
1897,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1898,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Yes, sir, but I'm just goin' back.”"
1899,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1900,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“I shall be leaving here at eleven in my cart. You come with me. I can't
1901,GARM--A HOSTAGE,have sick men running about all over the place. Report yourself at
1902,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"eleven, here.”"
1903,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1904,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"We did not say much when we went indoors, but the officer muttered and"
1905,GARM--A HOSTAGE,pulled his retriever's ears.
1906,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1907,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"He was a disgraceful, overfed doormat of a dog; and when he waddled off"
1908,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"to my cookhouse to be fed, I had a brilliant idea."
1909,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1910,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"At eleven o'clock that officer's dog was nowhere to be found, and you"
1911,GARM--A HOSTAGE,never heard such a fuss as his owner made. He called and shouted and
1912,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"grew angry, and hunted through my garden for half an hour."
1913,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1914,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Then I said:
1915,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1916,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“He's sure to turn up in the morning. Send a man in by rail, and I'll"
1917,GARM--A HOSTAGE,find the beast and return him.”
1918,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1919,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“Beast?” said the officer. “I value that dog considerably more than I
1920,GARM--A HOSTAGE,value any man I know. It's all very fine for you to talk--your dog's
1921,GARM--A HOSTAGE,here.”
1922,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1923,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"So she was--under my feet--and, had she been missing, food and wages"
1924,GARM--A HOSTAGE,would have stopped in my house till her return. But some people grow
1925,GARM--A HOSTAGE,fond of dogs not worth a cut of the whip. My friend had to drive away at
1926,GARM--A HOSTAGE,last with Stanley in the back seat; and then the dog-boy said to me:
1927,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1928,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“What kind of animal is Bullen Sahib's dog? Look at him!”
1929,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1930,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I went to the boy's hut, and the fat old reprobate was lying on a mat"
1931,GARM--A HOSTAGE,carefully chained up. He must have heard his master calling for twenty
1932,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"minutes, but had not even attempted to join him."
1933,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1934,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“He has no face,” said the dog-boy scornfully. “He is a punniar-kooter"
1935,GARM--A HOSTAGE,(a spaniel). He never tried to get that cloth off his jaws when his
1936,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"master called. Now Vixen-baba would have jumped through the window, and"
1937,GARM--A HOSTAGE,that Great Dog would have slain me with his muzzled mouth. It is true
1938,GARM--A HOSTAGE,that there are many kinds of dogs.”
1939,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1940,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Next evening who should turn up but Stanley. The officer had sent
1941,GARM--A HOSTAGE,him back fourteen miles by rail with a note begging me to return the
1942,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"retriever if I had found him, and, if I had not, to offer huge rewards."
1943,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"The last train to camp left at half-past ten, and Stanley, stayed till"
1944,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"ten talking to Garm. I argued and entreated, and even threatened to"
1945,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"shoot the bull-terrier, but the little man was as firm as a rock, though"
1946,GARM--A HOSTAGE,I gave him a good dinner and talked to him most severely. Garm knew as
1947,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"well as I that this was the last time he could hope to see his man, and"
1948,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"followed Stanley like a shadow. The retriever said nothing, but licked"
1949,GARM--A HOSTAGE,his lips after his meal and waddled off without so much as saying “Thank
1950,GARM--A HOSTAGE,you” to the disgusted dog-boy.
1951,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1952,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"So that last meeting was over, and I felt as wretched as Garm, who"
1953,GARM--A HOSTAGE,moaned in his sleep all night. When we went to the office he found a
1954,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"place under the table close to Vixen, and dropped flat till it was"
1955,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"time to go home. There was no more running out into the verandahs, no"
1956,GARM--A HOSTAGE,slinking away for stolen talks with Stanley. As the weather grew warmer
1957,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the dogs were forbidden to run beside the cart, but sat at my side on"
1958,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the seat, Vixen with her head under the crook of my left elbow, and Garm"
1959,GARM--A HOSTAGE,hugging the left handrail.
1960,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1961,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Here Vixen was ever in great form. She had to attend to all the moving
1962,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"traffic, such as bullock-carts that blocked the way, and camels, and led"
1963,GARM--A HOSTAGE,ponies; as well as to keep up her dignity when she passed low friends
1964,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"running in the dust. She never yapped for yapping's sake, but her"
1965,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"shrill, high bark was known all along the Mall, and other men's terriers"
1966,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"ki-yied in reply, and bullock-drivers looked over their shoulders and"
1967,GARM--A HOSTAGE,gave us the road with a grin.
1968,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1969,GARM--A HOSTAGE,But Garm cared for none of these things. His big eyes were on the
1970,GARM--A HOSTAGE,horizon and his terrible mouth was shut. There was another dog in the
1971,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"office who belonged to my chief. We called him “Bob the Librarian,”"
1972,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"because he always imagined vain rats behind the bookshelves, and in"
1973,GARM--A HOSTAGE,hunting for them would drag out half the old newspaper-files. Bob was a
1974,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"well-meaning idiot, but Garm did not encourage him. He would slide his"
1975,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"head round the door panting, “Rats! Come along Garm!” and Garm would"
1976,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"shift one forepaw over the other, and curl himself round, leaving Bob to"
1977,GARM--A HOSTAGE,whine at a most uninterested back. The office was nearly as cheerful as
1978,GARM--A HOSTAGE,a tomb in those days.
1979,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1980,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Once, and only once, did I see Garm at all contented with his"
1981,GARM--A HOSTAGE,surroundings. He had gone for an unauthorised walk with Vixen early one
1982,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Sunday morning, and a very young and foolish artilleryman (his battery"
1983,GARM--A HOSTAGE,had just moved to that part of the world) tried to steal them both.
1984,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Vixen, of course, knew better than to take food from soldiers, and,"
1985,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"besides, she had just finished her breakfast. So she trotted back with a"
1986,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"large piece of the mutton that they issue to our troops, laid it down"
1987,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"on my verandah, and looked up to see what I thought. I asked her where"
1988,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Garm was, and she ran in front of the horse to show me the way."
1989,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
1990,GARM--A HOSTAGE,About a mile up the road we came across our artilleryman sitting very
1991,GARM--A HOSTAGE,stiffly on the edge of a culvert with a greasy handkerchief on his
1992,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"knees. Garm was in front of him, looking rather pleased. When the man"
1993,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"moved leg or hand, Garm bared his teeth in silence. A broken string"
1994,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"hung from his collar, and the other half of it lay, all warm, in the"
1995,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"artilleryman's still hand. He explained to me, keeping his eyes straight"
1996,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"in front of him, that he had met this dog (he called him awful names)"
1997,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"walking alone, and was going to take him to the Fort to be killed for a"
1998,GARM--A HOSTAGE,masterless pariah.
1999,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2000,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I said that Garm did not seem to me much of a pariah, but that he had"
2001,GARM--A HOSTAGE,better take him to the Fort if he thought best. He said he did not care
2002,GARM--A HOSTAGE,to do so. I told him to go to the Fort alone. He said he did not want to
2003,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"go at that hour, but would follow my advice as soon as I had called off"
2004,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the dog. I instructed Garm to take him to the Fort, and Garm marched"
2005,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"him solemnly up to the gate, one mile and a half under a hot sun, and I"
2006,GARM--A HOSTAGE,told the quarter-guard what had happened; but the young artilleryman was
2007,GARM--A HOSTAGE,more angry than was at all necessary when they began to laugh. Several
2008,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"regiments, he was told, had tried to steal Garm in their time."
2009,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2010,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"That month the hot weather shut down in earnest, and the dogs slept"
2011,GARM--A HOSTAGE,in the bathroom on the cool wet bricks where the bath is placed. Every
2012,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"morning, as soon as the man filled my bath the two jumped in, and every"
2013,GARM--A HOSTAGE,morning the man filled the bath a second time. I said to him that he
2014,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"might as well fill a small tub specially for the dogs. “Nay,” said he"
2015,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"smiling, “it is not their custom. They would not understand. Besides,"
2016,GARM--A HOSTAGE,the big bath gives them more space.”
2017,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2018,GARM--A HOSTAGE,The punkah-coolies who pull the punkahs day and night came to know Garm
2019,GARM--A HOSTAGE,intimately. He noticed that when the swaying fan stopped I would call
2020,GARM--A HOSTAGE,out to the coolie and bid him pull with a long stroke. If the man still
2021,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"slept I would wake him up. He discovered, too, that it was a good thing"
2022,GARM--A HOSTAGE,to lie in the wave of air under the punkah. Maybe Stanley had taught him
2023,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"all about this in barracks. At any rate, when the punkah stopped, Garm"
2024,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"would first growl and cock his eye at the rope, and if that did not"
2025,GARM--A HOSTAGE,wake the man--it nearly always did--he would tiptoe forth and talk in
2026,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the sleeper's ear. Vixen was a clever little dog, but she could never"
2027,GARM--A HOSTAGE,connect the punkah and the coolie; so Garm gave me grateful hours of
2028,GARM--A HOSTAGE,cool sleep. But he was utterly wretched--as miserable as a human being;
2029,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"and in his misery he clung so closely to me that other men noticed it,"
2030,GARM--A HOSTAGE,and were envious. If I moved from one room to another Garm followed;
2031,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"if my pen stopped scratching, Garm's head was thrust into my hand; if"
2032,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I turned, half awake, on the pillow, Garm was up and at my side, for he"
2033,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"knew that I was his only link with his master, and day and night, and"
2034,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"night and day, his eyes asked one question--“When is this going to end?”"
2035,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2036,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Living with the dog as I did, I never noticed that he was more than"
2037,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"ordinarily upset by the hot weather, till one day at the Club a man"
2038,GARM--A HOSTAGE,said: “That dog of yours will die in a week or two. He's a shadow.” Then
2039,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"I dosed Garm with iron and quinine, which he hated; and I felt very"
2040,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"anxious. He lost his appetite, and Vixen was allowed to eat his dinner"
2041,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"under his eyes. Even that did not make him swallow, and we held a"
2042,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"consultation on him, of the best man-doctor in the place; a lady-doctor,"
2043,GARM--A HOSTAGE,who cured the sick wives of kings; and the Deputy Inspector-General of
2044,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the veterinary service of all India. They pronounced upon his symptoms,"
2045,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"and I told them his story, and Garm lay on a sofa licking my hand."
2046,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2047,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“He's dying of a broken heart,” said the lady-doctor suddenly."
2048,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2049,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“'Pon my word,” said the Deputy Inspector General, “I believe Mrs."
2050,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Macrae is perfectly right as usual.”
2051,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2052,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"The best man-doctor in the place wrote a prescription, and the"
2053,GARM--A HOSTAGE,veterinary Deputy Inspector-General went over it afterwards to be sure
2054,GARM--A HOSTAGE,that the drugs were in the proper dog-proportions; and that was the
2055,GARM--A HOSTAGE,first time in his life that our doctor ever allowed his prescriptions
2056,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"to be edited. It was a strong tonic, and it put the dear boy on his feet"
2057,GARM--A HOSTAGE,for a week or two; then he lost flesh again. I asked a man I knew to
2058,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"take him up to the Hills with him when he went, and the man came to the"
2059,GARM--A HOSTAGE,door with his kit packed on the top of the carriage. Garm took in the
2060,GARM--A HOSTAGE,situation at one red glance. The hair rose along his back; he sat down
2061,GARM--A HOSTAGE,in front of me and delivered the most awful growl I have ever heard in
2062,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the jaws of a dog. I shouted to my friend to get away at once, and as"
2063,GARM--A HOSTAGE,soon as the carriage was out of the garden Garm laid his head on my
2064,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"knee and whined. So I knew his answer, and devoted myself to getting"
2065,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Stanley's address in the Hills.
2066,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2067,GARM--A HOSTAGE,My turn to go to the cool came late in August. We were allowed thirty
2068,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"days' holiday in a year, if no one fell sick, and we took it as we could"
2069,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"be spared. My chief and Bob the Librarian had their holiday first, and"
2070,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"when they were gone I made a calendar, as I always did, and hung it up"
2071,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"at the head of my cot, tearing off one day at a time till they returned."
2072,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Vixen had gone up to the Hills with me five times before; and she
2073,GARM--A HOSTAGE,appreciated the cold and the damp and the beautiful wood fires there as
2074,GARM--A HOSTAGE,much as I did.
2075,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2076,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Garm,” I said, “we are going back to Stanley at Kasauli."
2077,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Kasauli--Stanley; Stanley--Kasauli.” And I repeated it twenty times.
2078,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"It was not Kasauli really, but another place. Still I remembered what"
2079,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Stanley had said in my garden on the last night, and I dared not change"
2080,GARM--A HOSTAGE,the name. Then Garm began to tremble; then he barked; and then he leaped
2081,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"up at me, frisking and wagging his tail."
2082,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2083,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"“Not now,” I said, holding up my hand. “When I say 'Go,' we'll go,"
2084,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Garm.” I pulled out the little blanket coat and spiked collar that Vixen
2085,GARM--A HOSTAGE,always wore up in the Hills to protect her against sudden chills and
2086,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"thieving leopards, and I let the two smell them and talk it over. What"
2087,GARM--A HOSTAGE,they said of course I do not know; but it made a new dog of Garm. His
2088,GARM--A HOSTAGE,eyes were bright; and he barked joyfully when I spoke to him. He ate his
2089,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"food, and he killed his rats for the next three weeks, and when he began"
2090,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"to whine I had only to say “Stanley--Kasauli; Kasauli--Stanley,” to wake"
2091,GARM--A HOSTAGE,him up. I wish I had thought of it before.
2092,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2093,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"My chief came back, all brown with living in the open air, and very"
2094,GARM--A HOSTAGE,angry at finding it so hot in the plains. That same afternoon we three
2095,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"and Kadir Buksh began to pack for our month's holiday, Vixen rolling in"
2096,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"and out of the bullock-trunk twenty times a minute, and Garm grinning"
2097,GARM--A HOSTAGE,all over and thumping on the floor with his tail. Vixen knew the routine
2098,GARM--A HOSTAGE,of travelling as well as she knew my office-work. She went to the
2099,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"station, singing songs, on the front seat of the carriage, while Garm"
2100,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"sat with me. She hurried into the railway carriage, saw Kadir Buksh make"
2101,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"up my bed for the night, got her drink of water, and curled up with her"
2102,GARM--A HOSTAGE,black-patch eye on the tumult of the platform. Garm followed her (the
2103,GARM--A HOSTAGE,crowd gave him a lane all to himself) and sat down on the pillows with
2104,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"his eyes blazing, and his tail a haze behind him."
2105,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2106,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"We came to Umballa in the hot misty dawn, four or five men, who had been"
2107,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"working hard for eleven months, shouting for our dâks--the two-horse"
2108,GARM--A HOSTAGE,travelling carriages that were to take us up to Kalka at the foot of the
2109,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Hills. It was all new to Garm. He did not understand carriages where you
2110,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"lay at full length on your bedding, but Vixen knew and hopped into her"
2111,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"place at once; Garm following. The Kalka Road, before the railway was"
2112,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"built, was about forty-seven miles long, and the horses were changed"
2113,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"every eight miles. Most of them jibbed, and kicked, and plunged, but"
2114,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"they had to go, and they went rather better than usual for Garm's deep"
2115,GARM--A HOSTAGE,bay in their rear.
2116,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2117,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"There was a river to be forded, and four bullocks pulled the carriage,"
2118,GARM--A HOSTAGE,and Vixen stuck her head out of the sliding-door and nearly fell into
2119,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"the water while she gave directions. Garm was silent and curious,"
2120,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"and rather needed reassuring about Stanley and Kasauli. So we rolled,"
2121,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"barking and yelping, into Kalka for lunch, and Garm ate enough for two."
2122,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2123,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"After Kalka the road wound among the hills, and we took a curricle with"
2124,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"half-broken ponies, which were changed every six miles. No one dreamed"
2125,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"of a railroad to Simla in those days, for it was seven thousand feet up"
2126,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"in the air. The road was more than fifty miles long, and the regulation"
2127,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"pace was just as fast as the ponies could go. Here, again, Vixen led"
2128,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Garm from one carriage to the other; jumped into the back seat, and"
2129,GARM--A HOSTAGE,shouted. A cool breath from the snows met us about five miles out of
2130,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Kalka, and she whined for her coat, wisely fearing a chill on the"
2131,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"liver. I had had one made for Garm too, and, as we climbed to the fresh"
2132,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"breezes, I put it on, and Garm chewed it uncomprehendingly, but I think"
2133,GARM--A HOSTAGE,he was grateful.
2134,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2135,GARM--A HOSTAGE,“Hi-yi-yi-yi!” sang Vixen as we shot round the curves; “Toot-toot-toot!”
2136,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"went the driver's bugle at the dangerous places, and “yow! yow!” bayed"
2137,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Garm. Kadir Buksh sat on the front seat and smiled. Even he was glad to
2138,GARM--A HOSTAGE,get away from the heat of the Plains that stewed in the haze behind us.
2139,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Now and then we would meet a man we knew going down to his work again,"
2140,GARM--A HOSTAGE,and he would say: “What's it like below?” and I would shout: “Hotter
2141,GARM--A HOSTAGE,than cinders. What's it like up above?” and he would shout back: “Just
2142,GARM--A HOSTAGE,perfect!” and away we would go.
2143,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2144,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Suddenly Kadir Buksh said, over his shoulder: “Here is Solon”; and Garm"
2145,GARM--A HOSTAGE,snored where he lay with his head on my knee. Solon is an unpleasant
2146,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"little cantonment, but it has the advantage of being cool and healthy."
2147,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"It is all bare and windy, and one generally stops at a rest-house nearby"
2148,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"for something to eat. I got out and took both dogs with me, while Kadir"
2149,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Buksh made tea. A soldier told us we should find Stanley “out there,”"
2150,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"nodding his head towards a bare, bleak hill."
2151,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2152,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"When we climbed to the top we spied that very Stanley, who had given me"
2153,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"all this trouble, sitting on a rock with his face in his hands, and his"
2154,GARM--A HOSTAGE,overcoat hanging loose about him. I never saw anything so lonely and
2155,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"dejected in my life as this one little man, crumpled up and thinking, on"
2156,GARM--A HOSTAGE,the great gray hillside.
2157,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2158,GARM--A HOSTAGE,Here Garm left me.
2159,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2160,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"He departed without a word, and, so far as I could see, without moving"
2161,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"his legs. He flew through the air bodily, and I heard the whack of him"
2162,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"as he flung himself at Stanley, knocking the little man clean over. They"
2163,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"rolled on the ground together, shouting, and yelping, and hugging. I"
2164,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"could not see which was dog and which was man, till Stanley got up and"
2165,GARM--A HOSTAGE,whimpered.
2166,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2167,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"He told me that he had been suffering from fever at intervals, and was"
2168,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"very weak. He looked all he said, but even while I watched, both man and"
2169,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"dog plumped out to their natural sizes, precisely as dried apples swell"
2170,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"in water. Garm was on his shoulder, and his breast and feet all at the"
2171,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"same time, so that Stanley spoke all through a cloud of Garm--gulping,"
2172,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"sobbing, slavering Garm. He did not say anything that I could"
2173,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"understand, except that he had fancied he was going to die, but that now"
2174,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"he was quite well, and that he was not going to give up Garm any more"
2175,GARM--A HOSTAGE,to anybody under the rank of Beelzebub.
2176,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2177,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Then he said he felt hungry, and thirsty, and happy."
2178,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2179,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"We went down to tea at the rest-house, where Stanley stuffed himself"
2180,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"with sardines and raspberry jam, and beer, and cold mutton and pickles,"
2181,GARM--A HOSTAGE,when Garm wasn't climbing over him; and then Vixen and I went on.
2182,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2183,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Garm saw how it was at once. He said good-bye to me three times, giving"
2184,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"me both paws one after another, and leaping on to my shoulder. He"
2185,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"further escorted us, singing Hosannas at the top of his voice, a mile"
2186,GARM--A HOSTAGE,down the road. Then he raced back to his own master.
2187,GARM--A HOSTAGE,
2188,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Vixen never opened her mouth, but when the cold twilight came, and we"
2189,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"could see the lights of Simla across the hills, she snuffled with her"
2190,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"nose at the breast of my ulster. I unbuttoned it, and tucked her inside."
2191,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"Then she gave a contented little sniff, and fell fast asleep, her head"
2192,GARM--A HOSTAGE,"on my breast, till we bundled out at Simla, two of the four happiest"
2193,GARM--A HOSTAGE,people in all the world that night.

2243,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2244,THE MOTHER HIVE,"If the stock had not been old and overcrowded, the Wax-moth would never"
2245,THE MOTHER HIVE,have entered; but where bees are too thick on the comb there must be
2246,THE MOTHER HIVE,sickness or parasites. The heat of the hive had risen with the June
2247,THE MOTHER HIVE,"honey-flow, and though the farmers worked, until their wings ached, to"
2248,THE MOTHER HIVE,"keep people cool, everybody suffered."
2249,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2250,THE MOTHER HIVE,"A young bee crawled up the greasy trampled alighting-board. “Excuse me,”"
2251,THE MOTHER HIVE,"she began, “but it's my first honey-flight. Could you kindly tell me if"
2252,THE MOTHER HIVE,this is my--”
2253,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2254,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“--own hive?” the Guard snapped. “Yes! Buzz in, and be foul-brooded to"
2255,THE MOTHER HIVE,you! Next!”
2256,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2257,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Shame!” cried half a dozen old workers with worn wings and nerves, and"
2258,THE MOTHER HIVE,there was a scuffle and a hum.
2259,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2260,THE MOTHER HIVE,"The little grey Wax-moth, pressed close in a crack in the"
2261,THE MOTHER HIVE,"alighting-board, had waited this chance all day. She scuttled in like a"
2262,THE MOTHER HIVE,"ghost, and, knowing the senior bees would turn her out at once, dodged"
2263,THE MOTHER HIVE,"into a brood-frame, where youngsters who had not yet seen the winds blow"
2264,THE MOTHER HIVE,"or the flowers nod discussed life. Here she was safe, for young bees"
2265,THE MOTHER HIVE,will tolerate any sort of stranger. Behind her came the bee who had been
2266,THE MOTHER HIVE,slanged by the Guard.
2267,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2268,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“What is the world like, Melissa?” said a companion. “Cruel! I brought"
2269,THE MOTHER HIVE,"in a full load of first-class stuff, and the Guard told me to go and be"
2270,THE MOTHER HIVE,foul-brooded!” She sat down in the cool draught across the combs.
2271,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2272,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“If you'd only heard,” said the Wax-moth silkily, “the insolence of"
2273,THE MOTHER HIVE,the Guard's tone when she cursed our sister. It aroused the Entire
2274,THE MOTHER HIVE,Community.” She laid an egg. She had stolen in for that purpose.
2275,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2276,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“There was a bit of a fuss on the Gate,” Melissa chuckled. “You were"
2277,THE MOTHER HIVE,"there, Miss?” She did not know how to address the slim stranger."
2278,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2279,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Don't call me 'Miss.' I'm a sister to all in affliction--just a
2280,THE MOTHER HIVE,working-sister. My heart bled for you beneath your burden.” The Wax-moth
2281,THE MOTHER HIVE,caressed Melissa with her soft feelers and laid another egg.
2282,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2283,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“You mustn't lay here,” cried Melissa. “You aren't a Queen.”"
2284,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2285,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“My dear child, I give you my most solemn word of honour those aren't"
2286,THE MOTHER HIVE,"eggs. Those are my principles, and I am ready to die for them.” She"
2287,THE MOTHER HIVE,raised her voice a little above the rustle and tramp round her. “If
2288,THE MOTHER HIVE,"you'd like to kill me, pray do.”"
2289,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2290,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Don't be unkind, Melissa,” said a young bee, impressed by the chaste"
2291,THE MOTHER HIVE,"folds of the Wax-moth's wing, which hid her ceaseless egg-dropping."
2292,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2293,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“I haven't done anything,” Melissa answered. “She's doing it all.”"
2294,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2295,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Ah, don't let your conscience reproach you later, but when you've"
2296,THE MOTHER HIVE,"killed me, write me, at least, as one that loved her fellow-worker.”"
2297,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2298,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Laying at every sob, the Wax-moth backed into a crowd of young bees, and"
2299,THE MOTHER HIVE,left Melissa bewildered and annoyed. So she lifted up her little voice
2300,THE MOTHER HIVE,"in the darkness and cried, “Stores!” till a gang of cell-fillers hailed"
2301,THE MOTHER HIVE,"her, and she left her load with them."
2302,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2303,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“I'm afraid I foul-brooded you just now,” said a voice over her"
2304,THE MOTHER HIVE,"shoulder. “I'd been on the Gate for three hours, and one would"
2305,THE MOTHER HIVE,foul-brood the Queen herself after that. No offence meant.”
2306,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2307,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“None taken,” Melissa answered cheerily. “I shall be on Guard myself,"
2308,THE MOTHER HIVE,some day. What's next to do?”
2309,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2310,THE MOTHER HIVE,“There's a rumour of Death's Head Moths about. Send a gang of youngsters
2311,THE MOTHER HIVE,"to the Gate, and tell them to narrow it in with a couple of stout"
2312,THE MOTHER HIVE,"scrap-wax pillars. It'll make the Hive hot, but we can't have Death's"
2313,THE MOTHER HIVE,Headers in the middle of our honey-flow.”
2314,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2315,THE MOTHER HIVE,“My Only Wings! I should think not!” Melissa had all a sound bee's
2316,THE MOTHER HIVE,"hereditary hatred against the big, squeaking, feathery Thief of the"
2317,THE MOTHER HIVE,Hives. “Tumble out!” she called across the youngsters' quarters. “All
2318,THE MOTHER HIVE,"you who aren't feeding babies, show a leg. Scrap-wax pillars for the"
2319,THE MOTHER HIVE,Ga-ate!” She chanted the order at length.
2320,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2321,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“That's nonsense,” a downy, day-old bee answered. “In the first place, I"
2322,THE MOTHER HIVE,never heard of a Death's Header coming into a hive. People don't do
2323,THE MOTHER HIVE,"such things. In the second, building pillars to keep 'em out is purely"
2324,THE MOTHER HIVE,"a Cypriote trick, unworthy of British bees. In the third, if you trust"
2325,THE MOTHER HIVE,"a Death's Head, he will trust you. Pillar-building shows lack of"
2326,THE MOTHER HIVE,confidence. Our dear sister in grey says so.”
2327,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2328,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Yes. Pillars are un-English and provocative, and a waste of wax that"
2329,THE MOTHER HIVE,"is needed for higher and more practical ends,” said the Wax-moth from an"
2330,THE MOTHER HIVE,empty store-cell.
2331,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2332,THE MOTHER HIVE,“The safety of the Hive is the highest thing I've ever heard of. You
2333,THE MOTHER HIVE,"mustn't teach us to refuse work,” Melissa began."
2334,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2335,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“You misunderstand me, as usual, love. Work's the essence of life;"
2336,THE MOTHER HIVE,but to expend precious unreturning vitality and real labour against
2337,THE MOTHER HIVE,"imaginary danger, that is heartbreakingly absurd! If I can only teach"
2338,THE MOTHER HIVE,a--a little toleration--a little ordinary kindness here toward that
2339,THE MOTHER HIVE,"absurd old bogey you call the Death's Header, I shan't have lived in"
2340,THE MOTHER HIVE,vain.”
2341,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2342,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“She hasn't lived in vain, the darling!” cried twenty bees together."
2343,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“You should see her saintly life, Melissa! She just devotes herself to"
2344,THE MOTHER HIVE,"spreading her principles, and--and--she looks lovely!”"
2345,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2346,THE MOTHER HIVE,"An old, baldish bee came up the comb."
2347,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2348,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Pillar-workers for the Gate! Get out and chew scraps. Buzz off!” she
2349,THE MOTHER HIVE,said. The Wax-moth slipped aside.
2350,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2351,THE MOTHER HIVE,"The young bees trooped down the frame, whispering. “What's the matter"
2352,THE MOTHER HIVE,with 'em?” said the oldster. “Why do they call each other 'ducky' and
2353,THE MOTHER HIVE,'darling'? Must be the weather.” She sniffed suspiciously. “Horrid
2354,THE MOTHER HIVE,"stuffy smell here. Like stale quilts. Not Wax-moth, I hope, Melissa?”"
2355,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2356,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Not to my knowledge,” said Melissa, who, of course, only knew the"
2357,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Wax-moth as a lady with principles, and had never thought to report"
2358,THE MOTHER HIVE,her presence. She had always imagined Wax-moths to be like blood-red
2359,THE MOTHER HIVE,dragon-flies.
2360,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2361,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“You had better fan out this corner for a little,” said the old bee and"
2362,THE MOTHER HIVE,"passed on. Melissa dropped her head at once, took firm hold with her"
2363,THE MOTHER HIVE,"fore-feet, and fanned obediently at the regulation stroke three hundred"
2364,THE MOTHER HIVE,"beats to the second. Fanning tries a bee's temper, because she must"
2365,THE MOTHER HIVE,always keep in the same place where she never seems to be doing any
2366,THE MOTHER HIVE,"good, and, all the while, she is wearing out her only wings. When a bee"
2367,THE MOTHER HIVE,"cannot fly, a bee must not live; and a bee knows it. The Wax-moth crept"
2368,THE MOTHER HIVE,"forth, and caressed Melissa again."
2369,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2370,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“I see,” she murmured, “that at heart you are one of Us.”"
2371,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2372,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“I work with the Hive,” Melissa answered briefly."
2373,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2374,THE MOTHER HIVE,“It's the same thing. We and the Hive are one.”
2375,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2376,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Then why are your feelers different from ours? Don't cuddle so.”
2377,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2378,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Don't be provincial, Carissima. You can't have all the world"
2379,THE MOTHER HIVE,alike--yet.”
2380,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2381,THE MOTHER HIVE,“But why do you lay eggs?” Melissa insisted. “You lay 'em like a
2382,THE MOTHER HIVE,Queen--only you drop them in patches all over the place. I've watched
2383,THE MOTHER HIVE,you.”
2384,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2385,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Ah, Brighteyes, so you've pierced my little subterfuge? Yes, they are"
2386,THE MOTHER HIVE,eggs. By and by they'll spread our principles. Aren't you glad?”
2387,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2388,THE MOTHER HIVE,“You gave me your most solemn word of honour that they were not eggs.”
2389,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2390,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“That was my little subterfuge, dearest--for the sake of the Cause."
2391,THE MOTHER HIVE,Now I must reach the young.” The Wax-moth tripped towards the fourth
2392,THE MOTHER HIVE,brood-frame where the young bees were busy feeding the babies.
2393,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2394,THE MOTHER HIVE,It takes some time for a sound bee to realize a malignant and continuous
2395,THE MOTHER HIVE,"lie. “She's very sweet and feathery,” was all that Melissa thought, “but"
2396,THE MOTHER HIVE,her talk sounds like ivy honey tastes. I'd better get to my field-work
2397,THE MOTHER HIVE,again.”
2398,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2399,THE MOTHER HIVE,She found the Gate in a sulky uproar. The youngsters told off to the
2400,THE MOTHER HIVE,"pillars had refused to chew scrap-wax because it made their jaws ache,"
2401,THE MOTHER HIVE,and were clamouring for virgin stuff.
2402,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2403,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Anything to finish the job!” said the badgered Guards. “Hang up, some"
2404,THE MOTHER HIVE,"of you, and make wax for these slack-jawed sisters.”"
2405,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2406,THE MOTHER HIVE,Before a bee can make wax she must fill herself with honey. Then she
2407,THE MOTHER HIVE,"climbs to safe foothold and hangs, while other gorged bees hang on to"
2408,THE MOTHER HIVE,her in a cluster. There they wait in silence till the wax comes. The
2409,THE MOTHER HIVE,"scales are either taken out of the maker's pockets by the workers, or"
2410,THE MOTHER HIVE,tinkle down on the workers while they wait. The workers chew them (they
2411,THE MOTHER HIVE,"are useless unchewed) into the all-supporting, all-embracing Wax of the"
2412,THE MOTHER HIVE,Hive.
2413,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2414,THE MOTHER HIVE,"But now, no sooner was the wax-cluster in position than the workers"
2415,THE MOTHER HIVE,below broke out again.
2416,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2417,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Come down!” they cried. “Come down and work! Come on, you Levantine"
2418,THE MOTHER HIVE,parasites! Don't think to enjoy yourselves up there while we're sweating
2419,THE MOTHER HIVE,down here!”
2420,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2421,THE MOTHER HIVE,"The cluster shivered, as from hooked fore-foot to hooked hind-foot it"
2422,THE MOTHER HIVE,"telegraphed uneasiness. At last a worker sprang up, grabbed the lowest"
2423,THE MOTHER HIVE,"waxmaker, and swung, kicking above her companions."
2424,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2425,THE MOTHER HIVE,“I can make wax too!” she bawled. “Give me a full gorge and I'll make
2426,THE MOTHER HIVE,tons of it.”
2427,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2428,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Make it, then,” said the bee she had grappled. The spoken word snapped"
2429,THE MOTHER HIVE,the current through the cluster. It shook and glistened like a cat's fur
2430,THE MOTHER HIVE,in the dark. “Unhook!” it murmured. “No wax for any one to-day.”
2431,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2432,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“You lazy thieves! Hang up at once and produce our wax,” said the bees"
2433,THE MOTHER HIVE,below.
2434,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2435,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Impossible! The sweat's gone. To make your wax we must have stillness,"
2436,THE MOTHER HIVE,"warmth, and food. Unhook! Unhook!”"
2437,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2438,THE MOTHER HIVE,"They broke up as they murmured, and disappeared among the other bees,"
2439,THE MOTHER HIVE,"from whom, of course, they were undistinguishable."
2440,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2441,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Seems as if we'd have to chew scrap-wax for these pillars, after all,”"
2442,THE MOTHER HIVE,said a worker.
2443,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2444,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Not by a whole comb,” cried the young bee who had broken the cluster."
2445,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Listen here! I've studied the question more than twenty minutes. It's
2446,THE MOTHER HIVE,"as simple as falling off a daisy. You've heard of Cheshire, Root and"
2447,THE MOTHER HIVE,Langstroth?”
2448,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2449,THE MOTHER HIVE,"They had not, but they shouted “Good old Langstroth!” just the same."
2450,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2451,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Those three know all that there is to be known about making hives. One
2452,THE MOTHER HIVE,"or t'other of 'em must have made ours, and if they've made it, they're"
2453,THE MOTHER HIVE,bound to look after it. Ours is a 'Guaranteed Patent Hive.' You can see
2454,THE MOTHER HIVE,it on the label behind.”
2455,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2456,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Good old guarantee! Hurrah for the label behind!” roared the bees.
2457,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2458,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Well, such being the case, I say that when we find they've betrayed us,"
2459,THE MOTHER HIVE,we can exact from them a terrible vengeance.”
2460,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2461,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Good old vengeance! Good old Root! 'Nuff said! Chuck it!” The crowd
2462,THE MOTHER HIVE,cheered and broke away as Melissa dived through.
2463,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2464,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“D'you know where Langstroth, Root and Cheshire live if you happen to"
2465,THE MOTHER HIVE,want 'em?” she asked of the proud panting orator.
2466,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2467,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Gum me if I know they ever lived at all! But aren't they beautiful
2468,THE MOTHER HIVE,names to buzz about? Did you see how it worked up the sisterhood?”
2469,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2470,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Yes; but it didn't defend the Gate,” she replied."
2471,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2472,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Ah, perhaps that's true, but think how delicate my position is, sister."
2473,THE MOTHER HIVE,"I've a magnificent appetite, and I don't like working. It's bad for the"
2474,THE MOTHER HIVE,mind. My instinct tells me that I can act as a restraining influence on
2475,THE MOTHER HIVE,"others. They would have been worse, but for me.”"
2476,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2477,THE MOTHER HIVE,"But Melissa had already risen clear, and was heading for a breadth of"
2478,THE MOTHER HIVE,"virgin white clover, which to an overtired bee is as soothing as plain"
2479,THE MOTHER HIVE,knitting to a woman.
2480,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2481,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“I think I'll take this load to the nurseries,” she said, when she had"
2482,THE MOTHER HIVE,"finished. “It was always quiet there in my day,” and she topped off with"
2483,THE MOTHER HIVE,two little pats of pollen for the babies.
2484,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2485,THE MOTHER HIVE,She was met on the fourth brood-comb by a rush of excited sisters all
2486,THE MOTHER HIVE,buzzing together.
2487,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2488,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“One at a time! Let me put down my load. Now, what is it, Sacharissa?”"
2489,THE MOTHER HIVE,she said.
2490,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2491,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Grey Sister--that fluffy one, I mean--she came and said we ought to be"
2492,THE MOTHER HIVE,"out in the sunshine gathering honey, because life was short. She said"
2493,THE MOTHER HIVE,"any old bee could attend to our babies, and some day old bees would."
2494,THE MOTHER HIVE,"That isn't true, Melissa, is it? No old bees can take us away from our"
2495,THE MOTHER HIVE,"babies, can they?”"
2496,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2497,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Of course not. You feed the babies while your heads are soft. When your
2498,THE MOTHER HIVE,"heads harden, you go on to field-work. Any one knows that.”"
2499,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2500,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“We told her so! We told her so; but she only waved her feelers, and"
2501,THE MOTHER HIVE,said we could all lay eggs like Queens if we chose. And I'm afraid
2502,THE MOTHER HIVE,"lots of the weaker sisters believe her, and are trying to do it. So"
2503,THE MOTHER HIVE,unsettling!”
2504,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2505,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Sacharissa sped to a sealed worker-cell whose lid pulsated, as the bee"
2506,THE MOTHER HIVE,within began to cut its way out.
2507,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2508,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Come along, precious!” she murmured, and thinned the frail top from the"
2509,THE MOTHER HIVE,"other side. A pale, damp, creased thing hoisted itself feebly on to the"
2510,THE MOTHER HIVE,comb. Sacharissa's note changed at once. “No time to waste! Go up the
2511,THE MOTHER HIVE,frame and preen yourself!” she said. “Report for nursing-duty in my ward
2512,THE MOTHER HIVE,to-morrow evening at six. Stop a minute. What's the matter with your
2513,THE MOTHER HIVE,third right leg?”
2514,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2515,THE MOTHER HIVE,The young bee held it out in silence--unmistakably a drone leg incapable
2516,THE MOTHER HIVE,of packing pollen.
2517,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2518,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Thank you. You needn't report till the day after to-morrow.” Sacharissa
2519,THE MOTHER HIVE,turned to her companion. “That's the fifth oddity hatched in my ward
2520,THE MOTHER HIVE,since noon. I don't like it.”
2521,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2522,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“There's always a certain number of 'em,” said Melissa. “You can't stop"
2523,THE MOTHER HIVE,"a few working sisters from laying, now and then, when they overfeed"
2524,THE MOTHER HIVE,themselves. They only raise dwarf drones.”
2525,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2526,THE MOTHER HIVE,“But we're hatching out drones with workers' stomachs; workers with
2527,THE MOTHER HIVE,drones' stomachs; and albinoes and mixed-leggers who can't pack
2528,THE MOTHER HIVE,pollen--like that poor little beast yonder. I don't mind dwarf drones
2529,THE MOTHER HIVE,"any more than you do (they all die in July), but this steady hatch of"
2530,THE MOTHER HIVE,"oddities frightens me, Melissa!”"
2531,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2532,THE MOTHER HIVE,“How narrow of you! They are all so delightfully clever and unusual and
2533,THE MOTHER HIVE,"interesting,” piped the Wax-moth from a crack above them. “Come here,"
2534,THE MOTHER HIVE,"you dear, downy duck, and tell us all about your feelings.”"
2535,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2536,THE MOTHER HIVE,“I wish she'd go!” Sacharissa lowered her voice. “She meets
2537,THE MOTHER HIVE,"these--er--oddities as they dry out, and cuddles 'em in corners.”"
2538,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2539,THE MOTHER HIVE,“I suppose the truth is that we're over-stocked and too well fed to
2540,THE MOTHER HIVE,"swarm,” said Melissa."
2541,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2542,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“That is the truth,” said the Queen's voice behind them. They had"
2543,THE MOTHER HIVE,not heard the heavy royal footfall which sets empty cells vibrating.
2544,THE MOTHER HIVE,Sacharissa offered her food at once. She ate and dragged her weary body
2545,THE MOTHER HIVE,forward. “Can you suggest a remedy?” she said.
2546,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2547,THE MOTHER HIVE,“New principles!” cried the Wax-moth from her crevice. “We'll apply them
2548,THE MOTHER HIVE,quietly later.”
2549,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2550,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Suppose we sent out a swarm?” Melissa suggested. “It's a little late,"
2551,THE MOTHER HIVE,but it might ease us off.”
2552,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2553,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“It would save us, but--I know the Hive! You shall see for yourself.”"
2554,THE MOTHER HIVE,"The old Queen cried the Swarming Cry, which to a bee of good blood"
2555,THE MOTHER HIVE,should be what the trumpet was to Job's war-horse. In spite of her
2556,THE MOTHER HIVE,"immense age (three, years), it rang between the cañon-like frames as a"
2557,THE MOTHER HIVE,"pibroch rings in a mountain pass; the fanners changed their note, and"
2558,THE MOTHER HIVE,"repeated it up in every gallery; and the broad-winged drones, burly and"
2559,THE MOTHER HIVE,"eager, ended it on one nerve-thrilling outbreak of bugles: “La Reine le"
2560,THE MOTHER HIVE,veult! Swarm! Swar-rm! Swar-r-rm!”
2561,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2562,THE MOTHER HIVE,But the roar which should follow the Call was wanting. They heard a
2563,THE MOTHER HIVE,broken grumble like the murmur of a falling tide.
2564,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2565,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Swarm? What for? Catch me leaving a good bar-frame Hive, with fixed"
2566,THE MOTHER HIVE,"foundations, for a rotten, old oak out in the open where it may rain any"
2567,THE MOTHER HIVE,minute! We're all right! It's a 'Patent Guaranteed Hive.' Why do they
2568,THE MOTHER HIVE,want to turn us out? Swarming be gummed! Swarming was invented to cheat
2569,THE MOTHER HIVE,a worker out of her proper comforts. Come on off to bed!”
2570,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2571,THE MOTHER HIVE,The noise died out as the bees settled in empty cells for the night.
2572,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2573,THE MOTHER HIVE,“You hear?” said the Queen. “I know the Hive!”
2574,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2575,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Quite between ourselves, I taught them that,” cried the Wax-moth."
2576,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Wait till my principles develop, and you'll see the light from a new"
2577,THE MOTHER HIVE,quarter.”
2578,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2579,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“You speak truth for once,” the Queen said suddenly, for she recognized"
2580,THE MOTHER HIVE,the Wax-moth. “That Light will break into the top of the Hive. A Hot
2581,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Smoke will follow it, and your children will not be able to hide in any"
2582,THE MOTHER HIVE,crevice.”
2583,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2584,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Is it possible?” Melissa whispered. “I--we have sometimes heard a legend
2585,THE MOTHER HIVE,like it.”
2586,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2587,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“It is no legend,” the old Queen answered. “I had it from my mother, and"
2588,THE MOTHER HIVE,"she had it from hers. After the Wax-moth has grown strong, a Shadow will"
2589,THE MOTHER HIVE,fall across the gate; a Voice will speak from behind a Veil; there will
2590,THE MOTHER HIVE,"be Light, and Hot Smoke, and earthquakes, and those who live will see"
2591,THE MOTHER HIVE,"everything that they have done, all together in one place, burned up in"
2592,THE MOTHER HIVE,one great fire.” The old Queen was trying to tell what she had been told
2593,THE MOTHER HIVE,"of the Bee Master's dealings with an infected hive in the apiary, two or"
2594,THE MOTHER HIVE,"three seasons ago; and, of course, from her point of view the affair was"
2595,THE MOTHER HIVE,as important as the Day of Judgment.
2596,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2597,THE MOTHER HIVE,“And then?” asked horrified Sacharissa.
2598,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2599,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Then, I have heard that a little light will burn in a great darkness,"
2600,THE MOTHER HIVE,"and perhaps the world will begin again. Myself, I think not.”"
2601,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2602,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Tut! Tut!” the Wax-moth cried. “You good, fat people always prophesy"
2603,THE MOTHER HIVE,ruin if things don't go exactly your way. But I grant you there will be
2604,THE MOTHER HIVE,changes.”
2605,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2606,THE MOTHER HIVE,"There were. When her eggs hatched, the wax was riddled with little"
2607,THE MOTHER HIVE,"tunnels, coated with the dirty clothes of the caterpillars. Flannelly"
2608,THE MOTHER HIVE,"lines ran through the honey-stores, the pollen-larders, the foundations,"
2609,THE MOTHER HIVE,"and, worst of all, through the babies in their cradles, till the Sweeper"
2610,THE MOTHER HIVE,Guards spent half their time tossing out useless little corpses. The
2611,THE MOTHER HIVE,lines ended in a maze of sticky webbing on the face of the comb. The
2612,THE MOTHER HIVE,"caterpillars could not stop spinning as they walked, and as they walked"
2613,THE MOTHER HIVE,"everywhere, they smarmed and garmed everything. Even where it did not"
2614,THE MOTHER HIVE,"hamper the bees' feet, the stale, sour smell of the stuff put them off"
2615,THE MOTHER HIVE,their work; though some of the bees who had taken to egg laying said it
2616,THE MOTHER HIVE,encouraged them to be mothers and maintain a vital interest in life.
2617,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2618,THE MOTHER HIVE,"When the caterpillars became moths, they made friends with the"
2619,THE MOTHER HIVE,"ever-increasing Oddities--albinoes, mixed-leggers, single-eyed"
2620,THE MOTHER HIVE,"composites, faceless drones, halfqueens and laying sisters; and"
2621,THE MOTHER HIVE,the ever-dwindling band of the old stock worked themselves bald and
2622,THE MOTHER HIVE,"fray-winged to feed their queer charges. Most of the Oddities would not,"
2623,THE MOTHER HIVE,"and many, on account of their malformations, could not, go through"
2624,THE MOTHER HIVE,"a day's field-work; but the Wax-moths, who were always busy on the"
2625,THE MOTHER HIVE,"brood-comb, found pleasant home occupations for them. One albino, for"
2626,THE MOTHER HIVE,"instance, divided the number of pounds of honey in stock by the number"
2627,THE MOTHER HIVE,"of bees in the Hive, and proved that if every bee only gathered honey"
2628,THE MOTHER HIVE,"for seven and three quarter minutes a day, she would have the rest of"
2629,THE MOTHER HIVE,"the time to herself, and could accompany the drones on their mating"
2630,THE MOTHER HIVE,flights. The drones were not at all pleased.
2631,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2632,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Another, an eyeless drone with no feelers, said that all brood-cells"
2633,THE MOTHER HIVE,"should be perfect circles, so as not to interfere with the grub or the"
2634,THE MOTHER HIVE,workers. He proved that the old six-sided cell was solely due to the
2635,THE MOTHER HIVE,"workers building against each other on opposite sides of the wall, and"
2636,THE MOTHER HIVE,"that if there were no interference, there would be no angles. Some bees"
2637,THE MOTHER HIVE,"tried the new plan for a while, and found it cost eight times more"
2638,THE MOTHER HIVE,"wax than the old six-sided specification; and, as they never allowed a"
2639,THE MOTHER HIVE,"cluster to hang up and make wax in peace, real wax was scarce. However,"
2640,THE MOTHER HIVE,they eked out their task with varnish stolen from new coffins at
2641,THE MOTHER HIVE,"funerals, and it made them rather sick. Then they took to cadging round"
2642,THE MOTHER HIVE,"sugar-factories and breweries, because it was easiest to get their"
2643,THE MOTHER HIVE,"material from those places, and the mixture of glucose and beer"
2644,THE MOTHER HIVE,"naturally fermented in store and blew the store-cells out of shape,"
2645,THE MOTHER HIVE,besides smelling abominably. Some of the sound bees warned them that
2646,THE MOTHER HIVE,"ill-gotten gains never prosper, but the Oddities at once surrounded them"
2647,THE MOTHER HIVE,and balled them to death. That was a punishment they were almost as
2648,THE MOTHER HIVE,"fond of as they were of eating, and they expected the sound bees to"
2649,THE MOTHER HIVE,feed them. Curiously enough the age-old instinct of loyalty and devotion
2650,THE MOTHER HIVE,"towards the Hive made the sound bees do this, though their reason told"
2651,THE MOTHER HIVE,them they ought to slip away and unite with some other healthy stock in
2652,THE MOTHER HIVE,the apiary.
2653,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2654,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“What, about seven and three-quarter minutes' work now?” said Melissa"
2655,THE MOTHER HIVE,"one day as she came in. “I've been at it for five hours, and I've only"
2656,THE MOTHER HIVE,half a load.”
2657,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2658,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Oh, the Hive subsists on the Hival Honey which the Hive produces,” said"
2659,THE MOTHER HIVE,a blind Oddity squatting in a store-cell.
2660,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2661,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“But honey is gathered from flowers outside two miles away sometimes,”"
2662,THE MOTHER HIVE,cried Melissa.
2663,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2664,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Pardon me,” said the blind thing, sucking hard. “But this is the Hive,"
2665,THE MOTHER HIVE,is it not?”
2666,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2667,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“It was. Worse luck, it is.”"
2668,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2669,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“And the Hival Honey is here, is it not?” It opened a fresh store-cell"
2670,THE MOTHER HIVE,to prove it.
2671,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2672,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Ye-es, but it won't be long at this rate,” said Melissa."
2673,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2674,THE MOTHER HIVE,“The rates have nothing to do with it. This Hive produces the Hival
2675,THE MOTHER HIVE,Honey. You people never seem to grasp the economic simplicity that
2676,THE MOTHER HIVE,underlies all life.”
2677,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2678,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Oh, me!” said poor Melissa, “haven't you ever been beyond the Gate?”"
2679,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2680,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Certainly not. A fool's eyes are in the ends of the earth. Mine are in
2681,THE MOTHER HIVE,my head.” It gorged till it bloated.
2682,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2683,THE MOTHER HIVE,Melissa took refuge in her poorly paid field-work and told Sacharissa
2684,THE MOTHER HIVE,the story.
2685,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2686,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Hut!” said that wise bee, fretting with an old maid of a thistle. “Tell"
2687,THE MOTHER HIVE,"us something new. The Hive's full of such as him--it, I mean.”"
2688,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2689,THE MOTHER HIVE,“What's the end to be? All the honey going out and none coming in.
2690,THE MOTHER HIVE,Things can't last this way!” said Melissa.
2691,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2692,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Who cares?” said Sacharissa. “I know now how drones feel the day before
2693,THE MOTHER HIVE,they're killed. A short life and a merry one for me.”
2694,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2695,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“If it only were merry! But think of those awful, solemn, lop-sided"
2696,THE MOTHER HIVE,Oddities waiting for us at home crawling and clambering and
2697,THE MOTHER HIVE,preaching--and dirtying things in the dark.”
2698,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2699,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“I don't mind that so much as their silly songs, after we've fed 'em,"
2700,THE MOTHER HIVE,"all about 'work among the merry, merry blossoms,'” said Sacharissa from"
2701,THE MOTHER HIVE,the deeps of a stale Canterbury bell.
2702,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2703,THE MOTHER HIVE,“I do. How's our Queen?” said Melissa.
2704,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2705,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Cheerfully hopeless, as usual. But she lays an egg now and then.”"
2706,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2707,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Does she so?” Melissa backed out of the next bell with a jerk. “Suppose
2708,THE MOTHER HIVE,"now, we sound workers tried to raise a Princess in some clean corner?”"
2709,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2710,THE MOTHER HIVE,“You'd be put to it to find one. The Hive's all Wax-moth and muckings.
2711,THE MOTHER HIVE,But--well?”
2712,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2713,THE MOTHER HIVE,“A Princess might help us in the time of the Voice behind the Veil that
2714,THE MOTHER HIVE,the Queen talks of. And anything is better than working for Oddities
2715,THE MOTHER HIVE,"that chirrup about work that they can't do, and waste what we bring"
2716,THE MOTHER HIVE,home.”
2717,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2718,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Who cares?” said Sacharissa. “I'm with you, for the fun of it. The"
2719,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Oddities would ball us to death, if they knew. Come home, and we'll"
2720,THE MOTHER HIVE,begin.”
2721,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2722,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2723,THE MOTHER HIVE,There is no room to tell how the experienced Melissa found a far-off
2724,THE MOTHER HIVE,frame so messed and mishandled by abandoned cell-building experiments
2725,THE MOTHER HIVE,"that, for very shame, the bees never went there. How in that ruin she"
2726,THE MOTHER HIVE,"blocked out a Royal Cell of sound wax, but disguised by rubbish till it"
2727,THE MOTHER HIVE,looked like a kopje among deserted kopjes. How she prevailed upon the
2728,THE MOTHER HIVE,hopeless Queen to make one last effort and lay a worthy egg. How the
2729,THE MOTHER HIVE,Queen obeyed and died. How her spent carcass was flung out on the
2730,THE MOTHER HIVE,"rubbish heap, and how a multitude of laying sisters went about dropping"
2731,THE MOTHER HIVE,"drone-eggs where they listed, and said there was no more need of Queens."
2732,THE MOTHER HIVE,"How, covered by this confusion, Sacharissa educated certain young bees"
2733,THE MOTHER HIVE,to educate certain new-born bees in the almost lost art of making Royal
2734,THE MOTHER HIVE,Jelly. How the nectar for it was won out of hours in the teeth of chill
2735,THE MOTHER HIVE,"winds. How the hidden egg hatched true--no drone, but Blood Royal. How"
2736,THE MOTHER HIVE,"it was capped, and how desperately they worked to feed and double-feed"
2737,THE MOTHER HIVE,"the now swarming Oddities, lest any break in the food-supplies should"
2738,THE MOTHER HIVE,"set them to instituting inquiries, which, with songs about work, was"
2739,THE MOTHER HIVE,"their favourite amusement. How in an auspicious hour, on a moonless"
2740,THE MOTHER HIVE,"night, the Princess came forth a Princess indeed, and how Melissa"
2741,THE MOTHER HIVE,"smuggled her into a dark empty honey-magazine, to bide her time; and"
2742,THE MOTHER HIVE,"how the drones, knowing she was there, went about singing the deep"
2743,THE MOTHER HIVE,disreputable love-songs of the old days--to the scandal of the laying
2744,THE MOTHER HIVE,"sisters, who do not think well of drones. These things are, written"
2745,THE MOTHER HIVE,"in the Book of Queens, which is laid up in the hollow of the Great Ash"
2746,THE MOTHER HIVE,Ygdrasil.
2747,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2748,THE MOTHER HIVE,After a few days the weather changed again and became glorious. Even the
2749,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Oddities would now join the crowd that hung out on the alighting-board,"
2750,THE MOTHER HIVE,"and would sing of work among the merry, merry blossoms till an untrained"
2751,THE MOTHER HIVE,"ear might have received it for the hum of a working hive. Yet, in truth,"
2752,THE MOTHER HIVE,their store-honey had been eaten long ago. They lived from day to day
2753,THE MOTHER HIVE,"on the efforts of the few sound bees, while the Wax-moth fretted and"
2754,THE MOTHER HIVE,consumed again their already ruined wax. But the sound bees never
2755,THE MOTHER HIVE,"mentioned these matters. They knew, if they did, the Oddities would hold"
2756,THE MOTHER HIVE,a meeting and ball them to death.
2757,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2758,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Now you see what we have done,” said the Wax-moths. “We have created"
2759,THE MOTHER HIVE,"New Material, a New Convention, a New Type, as we said we would.”"
2760,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2761,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“And new possibilities for us,” said the laying sisters gratefully. “You"
2762,THE MOTHER HIVE,"have given us a new life's work, vital and paramount.”"
2763,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2764,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“More than that,” chanted the Oddities in the sunshine; “you have"
2765,THE MOTHER HIVE,"created a new heaven and a new earth. Heaven, cloudless and accessible”"
2766,THE MOTHER HIVE,"(it was a perfect August evening) “and Earth teeming with the merry,"
2767,THE MOTHER HIVE,"merry blossoms, waiting only our honest toil to turn them all to good."
2768,THE MOTHER HIVE,"The--er--Aster, and the Crocus, and the--er--Ladies' Smock in her"
2769,THE MOTHER HIVE,"season, the Chrysanthemum after her kind, and the Guelder Rose bringing"
2770,THE MOTHER HIVE,forth abundantly withal.”
2771,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2772,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Oh, Holy Hymettus!” said Melissa, awestruck. “I knew they didn't know"
2773,THE MOTHER HIVE,"how honey was made, but they've forgotten the Order of the Flowers! What"
2774,THE MOTHER HIVE,will become of them?”
2775,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2776,THE MOTHER HIVE,A Shadow fell across the alighting-board as the Bee Master and his son
2777,THE MOTHER HIVE,came by. The Oddities crawled in and a Voice behind a Veil said: “I've
2778,THE MOTHER HIVE,neglected the old Hive too long. Give me the smoker.”
2779,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2780,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Melissa heard and darted through the gate. “Come, oh come!” she cried."
2781,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“It is the destruction the Old Queen foretold. Princess, come!”"
2782,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2783,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Really, you are too archaic for words,” said an Oddity in an alley-way."
2784,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“A cloud, I admit, may have crossed the sun; but why hysterics? Above"
2785,THE MOTHER HIVE,"all, why Princesses so late in the day? Are you aware it's the Hival"
2786,THE MOTHER HIVE,Tea-time? Let's sing grace.”
2787,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2788,THE MOTHER HIVE,Melissa clawed past him with all six legs. Sacharissa had run to what
2789,THE MOTHER HIVE,was left of the fertile brood-comb. “Down and out!” she called across
2790,THE MOTHER HIVE,"the brown breadth of it. “Nurses, guards, fanners, sweepers--out!”"
2791,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2792,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Never mind the babies. They're better dead.--Out, before the Light and"
2793,THE MOTHER HIVE,the Hot Smoke!”
2794,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2795,THE MOTHER HIVE,The Princess's first clear fearless call (Melissa had found her) rose
2796,THE MOTHER HIVE,and drummed through all the frames. “La Reine le veult! Swarm! Swar-rm!
2797,THE MOTHER HIVE,Swar-r-rm!”
2798,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2799,THE MOTHER HIVE,The Hive shook beneath the shattering thunder of a stuck-down quilt
2800,THE MOTHER HIVE,being torn back.
2801,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2802,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Don't be alarmed, dears,” said the Wax-moths. “That's our work. Look"
2803,THE MOTHER HIVE,"up, and you'll see the dawn of the New Day.”"
2804,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2805,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Light broke in the top of the hive as the Queen had, prophesied--naked"
2806,THE MOTHER HIVE,"light on the boiling, bewildered bees."
2807,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2808,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Sacharissa rounded up her rearguard, which dropped headlong off the"
2809,THE MOTHER HIVE,"frame, and joined the Princess's detachment thrusting toward the Gate."
2810,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Now panic was in full blast, and each sound bee found herself embraced"
2811,THE MOTHER HIVE,by at least three Oddities. The first instinct of a frightened bee is
2812,THE MOTHER HIVE,to break into the stores and gorge herself with honey; but there were no
2813,THE MOTHER HIVE,"stores left, so the Oddities fought the sound bees."
2814,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2815,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“You must feed us, or we shall die!” they cried, holding and clutching"
2816,THE MOTHER HIVE,"and slipping, while the silent scared earwigs and little spiders twisted"
2817,THE MOTHER HIVE,"between their legs. “Think of the Hive, traitors! The Holy Hive!”"
2818,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2819,THE MOTHER HIVE,“You should have thought before!” cried the sound bees. “Stay and see
2820,THE MOTHER HIVE,the dawn of your New Day.”
2821,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2822,THE MOTHER HIVE,They reached the Gate at last over the soft bodies of many to whom they
2823,THE MOTHER HIVE,had ministered.
2824,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2825,THE MOTHER HIVE,“On! Out! Up!” roared Melissa in the Princess's ear. “For the Hive's
2826,THE MOTHER HIVE,sake! To the Old Oak!”
2827,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2828,THE MOTHER HIVE,"The Princess left the alighting-board, circled once, flung herself at"
2829,THE MOTHER HIVE,"the lowest branch of the Old Oak, and her little loyal swarm--you could"
2830,THE MOTHER HIVE,"have covered it with a pint mug--followed, hooked, and hung."
2831,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2832,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Hold close!” Melissa gasped. “The old legends have come true! Look!”
2833,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2834,THE MOTHER HIVE,"The Hive was half hidden by smoke, and Figures moved through the smoke."
2835,THE MOTHER HIVE,"They heard a frame crack stickily, saw it heaved high and twirled round"
2836,THE MOTHER HIVE,"between enormous hands--a blotched, bulged, and perished horror of grey"
2837,THE MOTHER HIVE,"wax, corrupt brood, and small drone-cells, all covered with crawling"
2838,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Oddities, strange to the sun."
2839,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2840,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Why, this isn't a hive! This is a museum of curiosities,” said the"
2841,THE MOTHER HIVE,Voice behind the Veil. It was only the Bee Master talking to his son.
2842,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2843,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Can you blame 'em, father?” said a second voice. “It's rotten with"
2844,THE MOTHER HIVE,Wax-moth. See here!”
2845,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2846,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Another frame came up. A finger poked through it, and it broke away in"
2847,THE MOTHER HIVE,rustling flakes of ashy rottenness.
2848,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2849,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Number Four Frame! That was your mother's pet comb once,” whispered"
2850,THE MOTHER HIVE,Melissa to the Princess. “Many's the good egg I've watched her lay
2851,THE MOTHER HIVE,there.”
2852,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2853,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Aren't you confusing post hoc with propter hoc?” said the Bee Master.
2854,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Wax-moth only succeed when weak bees let them in.” A third frame
2855,THE MOTHER HIVE,crackled and rose into the light. “All this is full of laying workers'
2856,THE MOTHER HIVE,brood. That never happens till the stock's weakened. Phew!”
2857,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2858,THE MOTHER HIVE,"He beat it on his knee like a tambourine, and it also crumbled to"
2859,THE MOTHER HIVE,pieces.
2860,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2861,THE MOTHER HIVE,The little swarm shivered as they watched the dwarf drone-grubs squirm
2862,THE MOTHER HIVE,"feebly on the grass. Many sound bees had nursed on that frame, well"
2863,THE MOTHER HIVE,knowing their work was useless; but the actual sight of even useless
2864,THE MOTHER HIVE,work destroyed disheartens a good worker.
2865,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2866,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“No, they have some recuperative power left,” said the second voice."
2867,THE MOTHER HIVE,“Here's a Queen cell!”
2868,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2869,THE MOTHER HIVE,“But it's tucked away among---- What on earth has come to the little
2870,THE MOTHER HIVE,wretches? They seem to have lost the instinct of cell-building.” The
2871,THE MOTHER HIVE,father held up the frame where the bees had experimented in circular
2872,THE MOTHER HIVE,cell-work. It looked like the pitted head of a decaying toadstool.
2873,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2874,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Not altogether,” the son corrected. “There's one line, at least, of"
2875,THE MOTHER HIVE,perfectly good cells.”
2876,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2877,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“My work,” said Sacharissa to herself. “I'm glad Man does me justice"
2878,THE MOTHER HIVE,before--”
2879,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2880,THE MOTHER HIVE,"That frame, too, was smashed out and thrown atop of the others and the"
2881,THE MOTHER HIVE,foul earwiggy quilts.
2882,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2883,THE MOTHER HIVE,"As frame after frame followed it, the swarm beheld the upheaval,"
2884,THE MOTHER HIVE,"exposure, and destruction of all that had been well or ill done in every"
2885,THE MOTHER HIVE,cranny of their Hive for generations past. There was black comb so old
2886,THE MOTHER HIVE,"that they had forgotten where it hung; orange, buff, and ochre-varnished"
2887,THE MOTHER HIVE,"store-comb, built as bees were used to build before the days of"
2888,THE MOTHER HIVE,"artificial foundations; and there was a little, white, frail new work."
2889,THE MOTHER HIVE,"There were sheets on sheets of level, even brood-comb that had held in"
2890,THE MOTHER HIVE,its time unnumbered thousands of unnamed workers; patches of obsolete
2891,THE MOTHER HIVE,"drone-comb, broad and high-shouldered, showing to what marks the male"
2892,THE MOTHER HIVE,"grub was expected to grow; and two-inch deep honey-magazines, empty, but"
2893,THE MOTHER HIVE,"still magnificent, the whole gummed and glued into twisted scrap-work,"
2894,THE MOTHER HIVE,"awry on the wires; half-cells, beginnings abandoned, or grandiose,"
2895,THE MOTHER HIVE,"weak-walled, composite cells pieced out with rubbish and capped with"
2896,THE MOTHER HIVE,dirt.
2897,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2898,THE MOTHER HIVE,"Good or bad, every inch of it was so riddled by the tunnels of the"
2899,THE MOTHER HIVE,Wax-moth that it broke in clouds of dust as it was flung on the heap.
2900,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2901,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Oh, see!” cried Sacharissa. “The Great Burning that Our Queen foretold."
2902,THE MOTHER HIVE,Who can bear to look?”
2903,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2904,THE MOTHER HIVE,"A flame crawled up the pile of rubbish, and they smelt singeing wax."
2905,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2906,THE MOTHER HIVE,"The Figures stooped, lifted the Hive and shook it upside down over the"
2907,THE MOTHER HIVE,"pyre. A cascade of Oddities, chips of broken comb, scale, fluff, and"
2908,THE MOTHER HIVE,"grubs slid out, crackled, sizzled, popped a little, and then the flames"
2909,THE MOTHER HIVE,roared up and consumed all that fuel.
2910,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2911,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“We must disinfect,” said a Voice. “Get me a sulphur-candle, please.”"
2912,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2913,THE MOTHER HIVE,"The shell of the Hive was returned to its place, a light was set in"
2914,THE MOTHER HIVE,"its sticky emptiness, tier by tier the Figures built it up, closed the"
2915,THE MOTHER HIVE,"entrance, and went away. The swarm watched the light leaking through"
2916,THE MOTHER HIVE,"the cracks all the long night. At dawn one Wax-moth came by, fluttering"
2917,THE MOTHER HIVE,impudently.
2918,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2919,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“There has been a miscalculation about the New Day, my dears,” she"
2920,THE MOTHER HIVE,began; “one can't expect people to be perfect all at once. That was our
2921,THE MOTHER HIVE,mistake.”
2922,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2923,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“No, the mistake was entirely ours,” said the Princess."
2924,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2925,THE MOTHER HIVE,"“Pardon me,” said the Wax-moth. “When you think of the enormous"
2926,THE MOTHER HIVE,"upheaval--call it good or bad--which our influence brought about, you"
2927,THE MOTHER HIVE,"will admit that we, and we alone--”"
2928,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2929,THE MOTHER HIVE,“You?” said the Princess. “Our stock was not strong. So you came--as any
2930,THE MOTHER HIVE,"other disease might have come. Hang close, all my people.”"
2931,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2932,THE MOTHER HIVE,"When the sun rose, Veiled Figures came down, and saw their swarm at the"
2933,THE MOTHER HIVE,"bough's end waiting patiently within sight of the old Hive--a handful,"
2934,THE MOTHER HIVE,but prepared to go on.
2935,THE MOTHER HIVE,
2936,THE MOTHER HIVE,

2955,THE BEES AND THE FLIES,Sat down to wait the promised swarm.

3036,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,is thirty-seven. Contrast this with the nine hundred by ninety-five of

3070,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,aperture--a bottomless hatch at present--into which our coach will

3080,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"Geary. Receipt has been given and taken. “Pleasant run,” says Mr. Geary,"
3081,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,and disappears through the door which a foot high pneumatic compressor

3083,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3084,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,“A-ah!” sighs the compressor released. Our holding-down clips part with

3103,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"colloid is unshuttered and Captain Purnall, one hand on the wheel,"
3104,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,is feeling for a fair slant. The dial shows 4300 feet. “It's steep

3715,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"unobserved, but the deep airboom on our skin changes to a joyful shout."
3716,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3717,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"“The dawn-gust,” says Tim. “It'll go on to meet the Sun. Look!"
3718,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,Look! There's the dark being crammed back over our bows! Come to the
3719,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,after-colloid. I'll show you something.”
3720,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3721,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"The engine-room is hot and stuffy; the clerks in the coach are asleep,"
3722,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,and the Slave of the Ray is ready to follow them. Tim slides open the
3723,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,aft colloid and reveals the curve of the world--the ocean's deepest
3724,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,purple--edged with fuming and intolerable gold.
3725,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3726,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,Then the Sun rises and through the colloid strikes out our lamps. Tim
3727,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,scowls in his face.
3728,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3729,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"“Squirrels in a cage,” he mutters. “That's all we are. Squirrels in"
3730,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"a cage! He's going twice as fast as us. Just you wait a few years, my"
3731,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"shining friend, and we'll take steps that will amaze you. We'll Joshua"
3732,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,you!”
3733,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3734,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"Yes, that is our dream: to turn all earth into the Vale of Ajalon at our"
3735,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"pleasure. So far, we can drag out the dawn to twice its normal length"
3736,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,in these latitudes. But some day--even on the Equator--we shall hold the
3737,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,Sun level in his full stride.
3738,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3739,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,Now we look down on a sea thronged with heavy traffic. A big submersible
3740,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,breaks water suddenly. Another and another follows with a swash and
3741,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,a suck and a savage bubbling of relieved pressures. The deep-sea
3742,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"freighters are rising to lung up after the long night, and the leisurely"
3743,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,ocean is all patterned with peacock's eyes of foam.
3744,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3745,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"“We'll lung up, too,” says Tim, and when we return to the c. p. George"
3746,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"shuts off, the colloids are opened, and the fresh air sweeps her out."
3747,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,There is no hurry. The old contracts (they will be revised at the end of
3748,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,the year) allow twelve hours for a run which any packet can put behind
3749,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,her in ten. So we breakfast in the arms of an easterly slant which
3750,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,pushes us along at a languid twenty.
3751,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3752,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"To enjoy life, and tobacco, begin both on a sunny morning half a mile or"
3753,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,so above the dappled Atlantic cloud-belts and after a volt-flurry which
3754,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,has cleared and tempered your nerves. While we discussed the thickening
3755,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,traffic with the superiority that comes of having a high level reserved
3756,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"to ourselves, we heard (and I for the first time) the morning hymn on a"
3757,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,Hospital boat.
3758,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3759,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,She was cloaked by a skein of ravelled fluff beneath us and we caught
3760,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"the chant before she rose into the sunlight. “Oh, ye Winds of God,” sang"
3761,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,the unseen voices: “bless ye the Lord! Praise Him and magnify Him for
3762,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,ever!”
3763,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3764,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,We slid off our caps and joined in. When our shadow fell across her
3765,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,great open platforms they looked up and stretched out their hands
3766,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,neighbourly while they sang. We could see the doctors and the nurses
3767,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,and the white-button-like faces of the cot-patients. She passed slowly
3768,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"beneath us, heading northward, her hull, wet with the dews of the"
3769,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"night, all ablaze in the sunshine. So took she the shadow of a cloud"
3770,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"and vanished, her song continuing. “Oh, ye holy and humble men of heart,"
3771,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,bless ye the Lord! Praise Him and magnify Him for ever.”
3772,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3773,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,“She's a public lunger or she wouldn't have been singing the Benedicite;
3774,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,and she's a Greenlander or she wouldn't have snow-blinds over her
3775,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"colloids,” said George at last. “She'll be bound for Frederikshavn or"
3776,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,one of the Glacier sanatoriums for a month. If she was an accident ward
3777,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,she'd be hung up at the eight-thousand-foot level. Yes--consumptives.”
3778,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3779,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"“Funny how the new things are the old thing I've read in books,” Tim"
3780,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"answered, “that savages used to haul their sick and wounded up to"
3781,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,the tops of hills because microbes were fewer there. We hoist 'em in
3782,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,sterilized air for a while. Same idea. How much do the doctors say we've
3783,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,added to the average life of man?”
3784,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3785,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"“Thirty years,” says George with a twinkle in his eye. “Are we going to"

3788,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"“Flap ahead, then. Flap ahead. Who's hindering?” the senior captain"
3789,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"laughed, as we went in."
3790,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3791,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,We held a good lift to clear the coastwise and Continental shipping;
3792,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"and we had need of it. Though our route is in no sense a populated one,"
3793,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,there is a steady trickle of traffic this way along. We met Hudson Bay
3794,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"furriers out of the Great Preserve, hurrying to make their departure"
3795,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,from Bonavista with sable and black fox for the insatiable markets. We

3797,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"see no land between Trepassy and Lanco, know what gold they bring back"
3798,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"from West Erica. Trans-Asiatic Directs we met, soberly ringing the"

3800,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"white-painted Ackroyd & Hunt fruiters out of the south fled beneath us,"
3801,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,their ventilated hulls whistling like Chinese kites. Their market is
3802,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,in the North among the northern sanatoria where you can smell their
3803,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,grape-fruit and bananas across the cold snows. Argentine beef boats we
3804,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"sighted too, of enormous capacity and unlovely outline. They, too, feed"
3805,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,the northern health stations in icebound ports where submersibles dare
3806,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,not rise.
3807,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3808,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,Yellow-bellied ore-flats and Ungava petrol-tanks punted down leisurely
3809,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"out of the north, like strings of unfrightened wild duck. It does not"
3810,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,pay to “fly” minerals and oil a mile farther than is necessary; but the
3811,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,risks of transhipping to submersibles in the ice pack off Nain or Hebron
3812,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"are so great that these heavy freighters fly down to Halifax direct, and"

3816,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,
3817,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,We held to the St. Lawrence (it is astonishing how the old water-ways
3818,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"still pull us children of the air), and followed his broad line of black"

3822,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"We dropped to the Heights Receiving Towers twenty minutes ahead of time,"
3823,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,and there hung at ease till the Yokohama Intermediate Packet could pull
3824,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,out and give us our proper slip. It was curious to watch the action of
3825,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,the holding-down clips all along the frosty river front as the boats
3826,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,cleared or came to rest. A big Hamburger was leaving Pont Levis and her
3827,A STORY OF 2000 A. D.,"crew, unshipping the platform railings, began to sing “Elsinore”--the"

3978,NOTES,The Northern weather so far shows no sign of improvement. From all
3979,NOTES,quarters come complaints of the unusual prevalence of sleet at the
3980,NOTES,higher levels. Racing planes and digs alike have suffered severely--the
3981,NOTES,former from unequal deposits of half-frozen slush on their vans (and
3982,NOTES,only those who have “held up” a badly balanced plane in a cross-wind
3983,NOTES,"know what that means), and the latter from loaded bows and snow-cased"
3984,NOTES,"bodies. As a consequence, the Northern and North-western upper levels"
3985,NOTES,"have been practically abandoned, and the high fliers have returned to"
3986,NOTES,"the ignoble security of the Three, Five, and Six hundred foot levels."

3992,NOTES,
3993,NOTES,The scandals of the past few years have at last moved the yachting world
3994,NOTES,to concerted action in regard to “bat” boat racing. We have been treated
3995,NOTES,to the spectacle of what are practically keeled racing-planes driven a
3996,NOTES,"clear five foot or more above the water, and only eased down to touch"
3997,NOTES,their so-called “native element” as they near the line. Judges and
3998,NOTES,"starters have been conveniently blind to this absurdity, but the public"
3999,NOTES,demonstration off St. Catherine's Light at the Autumn Regattas has borne
4000,NOTES,"ample, if tardy, fruit. In the future the “bat” is to be a boat, and"
4001,NOTES,the long-unheeded demand of the true sportsman for “no daylight under
4002,NOTES,mid-keel in smooth water” is in a fair way to be conceded. The new rule
4003,NOTES,severely restricts plane area and lift alike. The gas compartments are
4004,NOTES,"permitted both fore and aft, as in the old type, but the water-ballast"
4005,NOTES,"central tank is rendered obligatory. These things work, if not"
4006,NOTES,"for perfection, at least for the evolution of a sane and wholesome"
4007,NOTES,"waterborne cruiser. The type of rudder is unaffected by the new rules,"
4008,NOTES,so we may expect to see the Long-Davidson make (the patent on which has
4009,NOTES,"just expired) come largely into use henceforward, though the strain"
4010,NOTES,on the sternpost in turning at speeds over forty miles an hour is
4011,NOTES,admittedly very severe. But bat-boat racing has a great future before

4018,NOTES,"Report, is not without humour. Till the 25th October Crete, as all our"
4019,NOTES,"planet knows, was the sole surviving European repository of “autonomous"
4020,NOTES,"institutions,” “local self-government,” and the rest of the archaic"
4021,NOTES,lumber devised in the past for the confusion of human affairs. She
4022,NOTES,has lived practically on the tourist traffic attracted by her annual
4023,NOTES,"pageants of Parliaments, Boards, Municipal Councils, etc., etc. Last"
4024,NOTES,"summer the islanders grew wearied, as their premier explained, of"
4025,NOTES,"“playing at being savages for pennies,” and proceeded to pull down all"
4026,NOTES,the landing-towers on the island and shut off general communication till
4027,NOTES,such time as the A. B. C. should annex them. For side-splitting comedy
4028,NOTES,we would refer our readers to the correspondence between the Board of
4029,NOTES,"Control and the Cretan premier during the “war.” However, all's well"
4030,NOTES,that ends well. The A. B. C. have taken over the administration of Crete
4031,NOTES,"on normal lines; and tourists must go elsewhere to witness the “debates,”"
4032,NOTES,"“resolutions,” and “popular movements” of the old days. The only people"
4033,NOTES,"to suffer will be the Board of Control, which is grievously overworked"
4034,NOTES,already. It is easy enough to condemn the Cretans for their
4035,NOTES,"laziness; but when one recalls the large, prosperous, and presumably"
4036,NOTES,public-spirited communities which during the last few years have
4037,NOTES,"deliberately thrown themselves into the hands of the A. B. C., one,"
4038,NOTES,cannot be too hard upon St. Paul's old friends.

4045,CORRESPONDENCE,
4046,CORRESPONDENCE,"To the Editor: Only last week, while crossing the Equator (W. 26-15),"
4047,CORRESPONDENCE,I became aware of a furious and irregular cannonading some fifteen or
4048,CORRESPONDENCE,"twenty knots S. 4 E. Descending to the 500 ft. level, I found a party"
4049,CORRESPONDENCE,of Transylvanian tourists engaged in exploding scores of the largest
4050,CORRESPONDENCE,"pattern atmospheric bombs (A. B. C. standard) and, in the intervals of"
4051,CORRESPONDENCE,"their pleasing labours, firing bow and stern smoke-ring swivels. This"
4052,CORRESPONDENCE,"orgy--I can give it no other name--went on for at least two hours,"
4053,CORRESPONDENCE,"and naturally produced violent electric derangements. My compasses, of"
4054,CORRESPONDENCE,"course, were thrown out, my bow was struck twice, and I received two"
4055,CORRESPONDENCE,"brisk shocks from the lower platform-rail. On remonstrating, I was told"
4056,CORRESPONDENCE,that these “professors” were engaged in scientific experiments. The
4057,CORRESPONDENCE,"extent of their “scientific” knowledge, may be judged by the fact that"
4058,CORRESPONDENCE,they expected to produce (I give their own words) “a little blue sky”
4059,CORRESPONDENCE,if “they went on long enough.” This in the heart of the Doldrums at 450
4060,CORRESPONDENCE,feet! I have no objection to any amount of blue sky in its proper place
4061,CORRESPONDENCE,(it can be found at the 4000 level for practically twelve months out of
4062,CORRESPONDENCE,"the year), but I submit, with all deference to the educational needs of"
4063,CORRESPONDENCE,"Transylvania, that “skylarking” in the centre of a main-travelled road"
4064,CORRESPONDENCE,"where, at the best of times, electricity literally drips off one's"
4065,CORRESPONDENCE,"stanchions and screw blades, is unnecessary. When my friends had"
4066,CORRESPONDENCE,"finished, the road was seared, and blown, and pitted with unequal"
4067,CORRESPONDENCE,"pressure layers, spirals, vortices, and readjustments for at least"
4068,CORRESPONDENCE,an hour. I pitched badly twice in an upward rush--solely due to these
4069,CORRESPONDENCE,diabolical throw-downs--that came near to wrecking my propeller.
4070,CORRESPONDENCE,Equatorial work at low levels is trying enough in all conscience without
4071,CORRESPONDENCE,the added terrors of scientific hooliganism in the Doldrums.

4091,J. VINCENT MATHEN.,"electric “leak,” and that the paralysis of your engines was due to"
4092,J. VINCENT MATHEN.,complete magnetization of all metallic parts. Low-flying planes often
4093,J. VINCENT MATHEN.,"“glue up” when near the Magnetic Pole, and there is no reason in science"

4177,REVIEW,The Life of Xavier Lavalle
4178,REVIEW,"(Reviewed by Rene Talland. École Aëronautique, Paris)"
4179,REVIEW,
4180,REVIEW,"Ten years ago Lavalle, “that imperturbable dreamer of the heavens,”"
4181,REVIEW,"as Lazareff hailed him, gathered together the fruits of a lifetime's"
4182,REVIEW,"labour, and gave it, with well-justified contempt, to a world bound"
4183,REVIEW,hand and foot to Barald's Theory of Vertices and “compensating electric
4184,REVIEW,"nodes.” “They shall see,” he wrote--in that immortal postscript to The"
4185,REVIEW,Heart of the Cyclone--“the Laws whose existence they derided written in
4186,REVIEW,fire beneath them.”
4187,REVIEW,
4188,REVIEW,"“But even here,” he continues, “there is no finality. Better a thousand"
4189,REVIEW,times my conclusions should be discredited than that my dead name should
4190,REVIEW,lie across the threshold of the temple of Science--a bar to further
4191,REVIEW,inquiry.”
4192,REVIEW,
4193,REVIEW,"So died Lavalle--a prince of the Powers of the Air, and even at his"
4194,REVIEW,funeral Cellier jested at “him who had gone to discover the secrets of
4195,REVIEW,the Aurora Borealis.”
4196,REVIEW,
4197,REVIEW,"If I choose thus to be banal, it is only to remind you that Céllier's"
4198,REVIEW,theories are today as exploded as the ludicrous deductions of the
4199,REVIEW,Spanish school. In the place of their fugitive and warring dreams we
4200,REVIEW,"have, definitely, Lavalle's Law of the Cyclone which he surprised in"
4201,REVIEW,darkness and cold at the foot of the overarching throne of the Aurora
4202,REVIEW,"Borealis. It is there that I, intent on my own investigations, have"
4203,REVIEW,"passed and re-passed a hundred times the worn leonine face, white as the"
4204,REVIEW,"snow beneath him, furrowed with wrinkles like the seams and gashes upon"
4205,REVIEW,"the North Cape; the nervous hand, integrally a part of the mechanism of"
4206,REVIEW,"his flighter; and above all, the wonderful lambent eyes turned to the"
4207,REVIEW,zenith.
4208,REVIEW,
4209,REVIEW,"“Master,” I would cry as I moved respectfully beneath him, “what is it"
4210,REVIEW,"you seek today?” and always the answer, clear and without doubt, from"
4211,REVIEW,"above: “The old secret, my son!”"
4212,REVIEW,
4213,REVIEW,"The immense egotism of youth forced me on my own path, but (cry of the"
4214,REVIEW,human always!) had I known--if I had known--I would many times have
4215,REVIEW,"bartered my poor laurels for the privilege, such as Tinsley and Herrera"
4216,REVIEW,"possess, of having aided him in his monumental researches."
4217,REVIEW,
4218,REVIEW,It is to the filial piety of Victor Lavalle that we owe the two volumes
4219,REVIEW,"consecrated to the ground-life of his father, so full of the holy"
4220,REVIEW,intimacies of the domestic hearth. Once returned from the abysms of the
4221,REVIEW,"utter North to that little house upon the outskirts of Meudon, it was"
4222,REVIEW,"not the philosopher, the daring observer, the man of iron energy that"
4223,REVIEW,"imposed himself on his family, but a fat and even plaintive jester, a"
4224,REVIEW,"farceur incarnate and kindly, the co-equal of his children, and, it must"
4225,REVIEW,"be written, not seldom the comic despair of Madame Lavalle, who, as she"
4226,REVIEW,"writes five years after the marriage, to her venerable mother, found “in"
4227,REVIEW,this unequalled intellect whose name I bear the abandon of a large and
4228,REVIEW,very untidy boy.” Here is her letter:
4229,REVIEW,
4230,REVIEW,"“Xavier returned from I do not know where at midnight, absorbed in"
4231,REVIEW,"calculations on the eternal question of his Aurora--la belle Aurore,"
4232,REVIEW,"whom I begin to hate. Instead of anchoring,--I had set out the"
4233,REVIEW,"guide-light above our roof, so he had but to descend and fasten the"
4234,REVIEW,"plane--he wandered, profoundly distracted, above the town with his"
4235,REVIEW,"anchor down! Figure to yourself, dear mother, it is the roof of the"
4236,REVIEW,"mayor's house that the grapnel first engages! That I do not regret, for"
4237,REVIEW,the mayor's wife and I are not sympathetic; but when Xavier uproots my
4238,REVIEW,pet araucaria and bears it across the garden into the conservatory I
4239,REVIEW,protest at the top of my voice. Little Victor in his night-clothes runs
4240,REVIEW,"to the window, enormously amused at the parabolic flight without reason,"
4241,REVIEW,"for it is too dark to see the grapnel, of my prized tree. The Mayor"
4242,REVIEW,"of Meudon, thunders at our door in the name of the Law, demanding,"
4243,REVIEW,"I suppose, my husband's head. Here is the conversation through the"
4244,REVIEW,megaphone--Xavier is two hundred feet above us:
4245,REVIEW,
4246,REVIEW,"“'Mons. Lavalle, descend and make reparation for outrage of domicile."
4247,REVIEW,"Descend, Mons. Lavalle!'"
4248,REVIEW,
4249,REVIEW,“No one answers.
4250,REVIEW,
4251,REVIEW,"“'Xavier Lavalle, in the name of the Law, descend and submit to process"
4252,REVIEW,for outrage of domicile.'
4253,REVIEW,
4254,REVIEW,"“Xavier, roused from his calculations, comprehending only the last"
4255,REVIEW,"words: 'Outrage of domicile? My dear mayor, who is the man that has"
4256,REVIEW,corrupted thy Julie?'
4257,REVIEW,
4258,REVIEW,"“The mayor, furious, 'Xavier Lavalle--'"
4259,REVIEW,
4260,REVIEW,"“Xavier, interrupting: 'I have not that felicity. I am only a dealer in"
4261,REVIEW,cyclones!'
4262,REVIEW,
4263,REVIEW,"“My faith, he raised one then! All Meudon attended in the streets, and"
4264,REVIEW,"my Xavier, after a long time comprehending what he had done, excused"
4265,REVIEW,himself in a thousand apologies. At last the reconciliation was effected
4266,REVIEW,in our house over a supper at two in the morning--Julie in a wonderful
4267,REVIEW,"costume of compromises, and I have her and the mayor pacified in bed in"
4268,REVIEW,the blue room.”
4269,REVIEW,
4270,REVIEW,"And on the next day, while the mayor rebuilds his roof, her Xavier"
4271,REVIEW,"departs anew for the Aurora Borealis, there to commence his life's work."
4272,REVIEW,M. Victor Lavalle tells us of that historic collision (en plane) on the
4273,REVIEW,"flank of Hecla between Herrera, then a pillar of the Spanish school,"
4274,REVIEW,and the man destined to confute his theories and lead him intellectually
4275,REVIEW,"captive. Even through the years, the immense laugh of Lavalle as he"
4276,REVIEW,"sustains the Spaniard's wrecked plane, and cries: “Courage! I shall not"
4277,REVIEW,"fall till I have found Truth, and I hold you fast!” rings like the"
4278,REVIEW,"call of trumpets. This is that Lavalle whom the world, immersed in"
4279,REVIEW,"speculations of immediate gain, did not know nor suspect--the Lavalle"
4280,REVIEW,whom they adjudged to the last a pedant and a theorist.
4281,REVIEW,
4282,REVIEW,"The human, as apart from the scientific, side (developed in his own"
4283,REVIEW,"volumes) of his epoch-making discoveries is marked with a simplicity,"
4284,REVIEW,"clarity, and good sense beyond praise. I would specially refer such as"
4285,REVIEW,doubt the sustaining influence of ancestral faith upon character and
4286,REVIEW,"will to the eleventh and nineteenth chapters, in which are contained"
4287,REVIEW,the opening and consummation of the Tellurionical Records extending over
4288,REVIEW,nine years. Of their tremendous significance be sure that the modest
4289,REVIEW,house at Meudon knew as little as that the Records would one day be the
4290,REVIEW,planet's standard in all official meteorology. It was enough for
4291,REVIEW,"them that their Xavier--this son, this father, this husband--ascended"
4292,REVIEW,"periodically to commune with powers, it might be angelic, beyond their"
4293,REVIEW,"comprehension, and that they united daily in prayers for his safety."
4294,REVIEW,
4295,REVIEW,"“Pray for me,” he says upon the eve of each of his excursions, and"
4296,REVIEW,"returning, with an equal simplicity, he renders thanks “after supper in"
4297,REVIEW,the little room where he kept his barometers.”
4298,REVIEW,
4299,REVIEW,"To the last Lavalle was a Catholic of the old school, accepting--he who"
4300,REVIEW,had looked into the very heart of the lightnings--the dogmas of papal
4301,REVIEW,"infallibility, of absolution, of confession--of relics great and small."
4302,REVIEW,Marvellous--enviable contradiction!
4303,REVIEW,
4304,REVIEW,The completion of the Tellurionical Records closed what Lavalle himself
4305,REVIEW,was pleased to call the theoretical side of his labours--labours from
4306,REVIEW,which the youngest and least impressionable planeur might well have
4307,REVIEW,"shrunk. He had traced through cold and heat, across the deeps of the"
4308,REVIEW,"oceans, with instruments of his own invention, over the inhospitable"
4309,REVIEW,"heart of the polar ice and the sterile visage of the deserts, league by"
4310,REVIEW,"league, patiently, unweariedly, remorselessly, from their ever-shifting"
4311,REVIEW,cradle under the magnetic pole to their exalted death-bed in the utmost
4312,REVIEW,ether of the upper atmosphere each one of the Isoconical
4313,REVIEW,"Tellurions--Lavalle's Curves, as we call them today. He had"
4314,REVIEW,"disentangled the nodes of their intersections, assigning to each its"
4315,REVIEW,"regulated period of flux and reflux. Thus equipped, he summons Herrera"
4316,REVIEW,"and Tinsley, his pupils, to the final demonstration as calmly as though"
4317,REVIEW,he were ordering his flighter for some mid-day journey to Marseilles.
4318,REVIEW,
4319,REVIEW,"“I have proved my thesis,” he writes. “It remains now only that you"
4320,REVIEW,should witness the proof. We go to Manila to-morrow. A cyclone will form
4321,REVIEW,"off the Pescadores S. 17 E. in four days, and will reach its maximum"
4322,REVIEW,intensity twenty-seven hours after inception. It is there I will show
4323,REVIEW,you the Truth.”
4324,REVIEW,
4325,REVIEW,A letter heretofore unpublished from Herrera to Madame Lavalle tells us
4326,REVIEW,how the Master's prophecy was verified.
4327,REVIEW,
4328,REVIEW,I will not destroy its simplicity or its significance by any attempt to
4329,REVIEW,"quote. Note well, though, that Herrera's preoccupation throughout that"
4330,REVIEW,day and night of superhuman strain is always for the Master's bodily
4331,REVIEW,health and comfort.
4332,REVIEW,
4333,REVIEW,"“At such a time,” he writes, “I forced the Master to take the broth”; or"
4334,REVIEW,“I made him put on the fur coat as you told me.” Nor is Tinsley (see
4335,REVIEW,"pp. 184, 85) less concerned. He prepares the nourishment. He cooks"
4336,REVIEW,"eternally, imperturbably, suspended in the chaos of which the Master"
4337,REVIEW,"interprets the meaning. Tinsley, bowed down with the laurels of both"
4338,REVIEW,"hemispheres, raises himself to yet nobler heights in his capacity of a"
4339,REVIEW,devoted chef. It is almost unbelievable! And yet men write of the Master
4340,REVIEW,"as cold, aloof, self-contained. Such characters do not elicit the joyous"
4341,REVIEW,"and unswerving devotion which Lavalle commanded throughout life. Truly,"
4342,REVIEW,we have changed very little in the course of the ages! The secrets of
4343,REVIEW,"earth and sky and the links that bind them, we felicitate ourselves"
4344,REVIEW,we are on the road to discover; but our neighbours' heart and mind we
4345,REVIEW,"misread, we misjudge, we condemn now as ever. Let all, then, who love a"
4346,REVIEW,"man read these most human, tender, and wise volumes."

4825,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4826,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Long and long ago, when Devadatta was King of Benares, I wrote some"
4827,A DEAL IN COTTON,tales concerning Strickland of the Punjab Police (who married Miss
4828,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Youghal), and Adam, his son. Strickland has finished his Indian Service,"
4829,A DEAL IN COTTON,"and lives now at a place in England called Weston-super-Mare, where his"
4830,A DEAL IN COTTON,wife plays the organ in one of the churches. Semi-occasionally he comes
4831,A DEAL IN COTTON,"up to London, and occasionally his wife makes him visit his friends."
4832,A DEAL IN COTTON,Otherwise he plays golf and follows the harriers for his figure's sake.
4833,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4834,A DEAL IN COTTON,If you remember that Infant who told a tale to Eustace Cleever the
4835,A DEAL IN COTTON,"novelist, you will remember that he became a baronet with a vast estate."
4836,A DEAL IN COTTON,"He has, owing to cookery, a little lost his figure, but he never loses"
4837,A DEAL IN COTTON,his friends. I have found a wing of his house turned into a hospital
4838,A DEAL IN COTTON,"for sick men, and there I once spent a week in the company of two dismal"
4839,A DEAL IN COTTON,nurses and a specialist in “Sprue.” Another time the place was full of
4840,A DEAL IN COTTON,schoolboys--sons of Anglo-Indians whom the Infant had collected for the
4841,A DEAL IN COTTON,"holidays, and they nearly broke his keeper's heart."
4842,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4843,A DEAL IN COTTON,"But my last visit was better. The Infant called me up by wire, and I"
4844,A DEAL IN COTTON,"fell into the arms of a friend of mine, Colonel A.L. Corkran, so that"
4845,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the years departed from us, and we praised Allah, who had not yet"
4846,A DEAL IN COTTON,"terminated the Delights, nor separated the Companions."
4847,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4848,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Said Corkran, when he had explained how it felt to command a"
4849,A DEAL IN COTTON,native Infantry regiment on the border: “The Stricks are coming for
4850,A DEAL IN COTTON,to-night-with their boy.”
4851,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4852,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“I remember him. The little fellow I wrote a story about,” I said. “Is"
4853,A DEAL IN COTTON,he in the Service?”
4854,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4855,A DEAL IN COTTON,“No. Strick got him into the Centro-Euro-Africa Protectorate. He's
4856,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Assistant-Commissioner at Dupé--wherever that is. Somaliland, ain't it,"
4857,A DEAL IN COTTON,Stalky?” asked the Infant.
4858,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4859,A DEAL IN COTTON,Stalky puffed out his nostrils scornfully. “You're only three thousand
4860,A DEAL IN COTTON,miles out. Look at the atlas.”
4861,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4862,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Anyhow, he's as rotten full of fever as the rest of you,” said the"
4863,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Infant, at length on the big divan. “And he's bringing a native servant"
4864,A DEAL IN COTTON,"with him. Stalky be an athlete, and tell Ipps to put him in the stable"
4865,A DEAL IN COTTON,room.”
4866,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4867,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Why? Is he a Yao--like the fellow Wade brought here--when your
4868,A DEAL IN COTTON,"housekeeper had fits?” Stalky often visits the Infant, and has seen some"
4869,A DEAL IN COTTON,odd things.
4870,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4871,A DEAL IN COTTON,“No. He's one of old Strickland's Punjabi policemen--and quite
4872,A DEAL IN COTTON,European--I believe.”
4873,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4874,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Hooray! Haven't talked Punjabi for three months--and a Punjabi from
4875,A DEAL IN COTTON,Central Africa ought to be amusin'.”
4876,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4877,A DEAL IN COTTON,"We heard the chuff of the motor in the porch, and the first to enter was"
4878,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Agnes Strickland, whom the Infant makes no secret of adoring."
4879,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4880,A DEAL IN COTTON,"He is devoted, in a fat man's placid way, to at least eight designing"
4881,A DEAL IN COTTON,"women; but she nursed him once through a bad bout of Peshawur fever, and"
4882,A DEAL IN COTTON,"when she is in the house, it is more than all hers."
4883,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4884,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“You didn't send rugs enough,” she began. “Adam might have taken a"
4885,A DEAL IN COTTON,chill.”
4886,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4887,A DEAL IN COTTON,“It's quite warm in the tonneau. Why did you let him ride in front?”
4888,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4889,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Because he wanted to,” she replied, with the mother's smile, and we"
4890,A DEAL IN COTTON,were introduced to the shadow of a young man leaning heavily on the
4891,A DEAL IN COTTON,shoulder of a bearded Punjabi Mohammedan.
4892,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4893,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“That is all that came home of him,” said his father to me. “There"
4894,A DEAL IN COTTON,was nothing in it of the child with whom I had journeyed to Dalhousie
4895,A DEAL IN COTTON,centuries since.”
4896,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4897,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“And what is this uniform?” Stalky asked of Imam Din, the servant, who"
4898,A DEAL IN COTTON,came to attention on the marble floor.
4899,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4900,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“The uniform of the Protectorate troops, Sahib. Though I am the Little"
4901,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Sahib's body-servant, it is not seemly for us white men to be attended"
4902,A DEAL IN COTTON,by folk dressed altogether as servants.”
4903,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4904,A DEAL IN COTTON,“And--and you white men wait at table on horseback?” Stalky pointed to
4905,A DEAL IN COTTON,the man's spurs.
4906,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4907,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“These I added for the sake of honour when I came to England,” said Imam"
4908,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Din Adam smiled the ghost of a little smile that I began to remember,"
4909,A DEAL IN COTTON,and we put him on the big couch for refreshments. Stalky asked him how
4910,A DEAL IN COTTON,"much leave he had, and he said “Six months.”"
4911,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4912,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“But he'll take another six on medical certificate,” said Agnes"
4913,A DEAL IN COTTON,anxiously. Adam knit his brows.
4914,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4915,A DEAL IN COTTON,“You don't want to--eh? I know. Wonder what my second in command is
4916,A DEAL IN COTTON,"doing.” Stalky tugged his moustache, and fell to thinking of his Sikhs."
4917,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4918,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Ah!” said the Infant. “I've only a few thousand pheasants to look
4919,A DEAL IN COTTON,after. Come along and dress for dinner. We're just ourselves. What
4920,A DEAL IN COTTON,flower is your honour's ladyship commanding for the table?”
4921,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4922,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Just ourselves?” she said, looking at the crotons in the great hall."
4923,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Then let's have marigolds--the little cemetery ones.”
4924,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4925,A DEAL IN COTTON,So it was ordered.
4926,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4927,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Now, marigolds to us mean hot weather, discomfort, parting, and death."
4928,A DEAL IN COTTON,"That smell in our nostrils, and Adam's servant in waiting, we naturally"
4929,A DEAL IN COTTON,"fell back more and more on the old slang, recalling at each glass those"
4930,A DEAL IN COTTON,"who had gone before. We did not sit at the big table, but in the bay"
4931,A DEAL IN COTTON,"window overlooking the park, where they were carting the last of the"
4932,A DEAL IN COTTON,"hay. When twilight fell we would not have candles, but waited for the"
4933,A DEAL IN COTTON,"moon, and continued our talk in the dusk that makes one remember."
4934,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4935,A DEAL IN COTTON,Young Adam was not interested in our past except where it had touched
4936,A DEAL IN COTTON,his future. I think his mother held his hand beneath the table. Imam
4937,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Din--shoeless, out of respect to the floors--brought him his medicine,"
4938,A DEAL IN COTTON,"poured it drop by drop, and asked for orders."
4939,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4940,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Wait to take him to his cot when he grows weary,” said his mother, and"
4941,A DEAL IN COTTON,Imam Din retired into the shadow by the ancestral portraits.
4942,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4943,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Now what d'you expect to get out of your country?” the Infant asked,"
4944,A DEAL IN COTTON,when--our India laid aside we talked Adam's Africa. It roused him at
4945,A DEAL IN COTTON,once.
4946,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4947,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Rubber--nuts--gums--and so on,” he said. “But our real future is"
4948,A DEAL IN COTTON,cotton. I grew fifty acres of it last year in my District.”
4949,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4950,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“My District!” said his father. “Hear him, Mummy!”"
4951,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4952,A DEAL IN COTTON,“I did though! I wish I could show you the sample. Some Manchester chaps
4953,A DEAL IN COTTON,said it was as good as any Sea Island cotton on the market.”
4954,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4955,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“But what made you a cotton-planter, my son?” she asked."
4956,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4957,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“My Chief said every man ought to have a shouk (a hobby) of sorts, and"
4958,A DEAL IN COTTON,he took the trouble to ride a day out of his way to show me a belt of
4959,A DEAL IN COTTON,black soil that was just the thing for cotton.”
4960,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4961,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Ah! What was your Chief like?” Stalky asked, in his silkiest tones."
4962,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4963,A DEAL IN COTTON,“The best man alive--absolutely. He lets you blow your own nose
4964,A DEAL IN COTTON,yourself. The people call him”--Adam jerked out some heathen
4965,A DEAL IN COTTON,"phrase--“that means the Man with the Stone Eyes, you know.”"
4966,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4967,A DEAL IN COTTON,“I'm glad of that. Because I've heard--from other quarters”--Stalky's
4968,A DEAL IN COTTON,"sentence burned like a slow match, but the explosion was not long"
4969,A DEAL IN COTTON,delayed. “Other quarters!” Adam threw out a thin hand. “Every dog has
4970,A DEAL IN COTTON,"his fleas. If you listen to them, of course!” The shake of his head was"
4971,A DEAL IN COTTON,"as I remembered it among his father's policemen twenty years before, and"
4972,A DEAL IN COTTON,his mother's eyes shining through the dusk called on me to adore it. I
4973,A DEAL IN COTTON,kicked Stalky on the shin. One must not mock a young man's first love or
4974,A DEAL IN COTTON,loyalty.
4975,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4976,A DEAL IN COTTON,A lump of raw cotton appeared on the table.
4977,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4978,A DEAL IN COTTON,“I thought there might be a need. Therefore I packed it between our
4979,A DEAL IN COTTON,"shirts,” said the voice of Imam Din."
4980,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4981,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Does he know as much English as that?” cried the Infant, who had"
4982,A DEAL IN COTTON,forgotten his East.
4983,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4984,A DEAL IN COTTON,"We all admired the cotton for Adam's sake, and, indeed, it was very long"
4985,A DEAL IN COTTON,and glossy.
4986,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4987,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“It's--it's only an experiment,” he said. “We're such awful paupers we"
4988,A DEAL IN COTTON,can't even pay for a mailcart in my District. We use a biscuit-box
4989,A DEAL IN COTTON,on two bicycle wheels. I only got the money for that”--he patted the
4990,A DEAL IN COTTON,stuff--“by a pure fluke.”
4991,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4992,A DEAL IN COTTON,“How much did it cost?” asked Strickland.
4993,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4994,A DEAL IN COTTON,“With seed and machinery--about two hundred pounds. I had the labour
4995,A DEAL IN COTTON,done by cannibals.”
4996,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4997,A DEAL IN COTTON,“That sounds promising.” Stalky reached for a fresh cigarette.
4998,A DEAL IN COTTON,
4999,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“No, thank you,” said Agnes. “I've been at Weston-super-Mare a little"
5000,A DEAL IN COTTON,too long for cannibals. I'll go to the music-room and try over next
5001,A DEAL IN COTTON,Sunday's hymns.”
5002,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5003,A DEAL IN COTTON,"She lifted the boy's hand lightly to her lips, and tripped across the"
5004,A DEAL IN COTTON,acres of glimmering floor to the music-room that had been the Infant's
5005,A DEAL IN COTTON,ancestors' banqueting hall. Her grey and silver dress disappeared under
5006,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the musicians' gallery; two electrics broke out, and she stood backed"
5007,A DEAL IN COTTON,against the lines of gilded pipes.
5008,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5009,A DEAL IN COTTON,“There's an abominable self-playing attachment here!” she called.
5010,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5011,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Me!” the Infant answered, his napkin on his shoulder. “That's how I"
5012,A DEAL IN COTTON,play Parsifal.”
5013,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5014,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“I prefer the direct expression. Take it away, Ipps.”"
5015,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5016,A DEAL IN COTTON,We heard old Ipps skating obediently all over the floor.
5017,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5018,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Now for the direct expression,” said Stalky, and moved on the Burgundy"
5019,A DEAL IN COTTON,recommended by the faculty to enrich fever-thinned blood.
5020,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5021,A DEAL IN COTTON,“It's nothing much. Only the belt of cotton-soil my chief showed me
5022,A DEAL IN COTTON,ran right into the Sheshaheli country. We haven't been able to prove
5023,A DEAL IN COTTON,cannibalism against that tribe in the courts; but when a Sheshaheli
5024,A DEAL IN COTTON,"offers you four pounds of woman's breast, tattoo marks and all, skewered"
5025,A DEAL IN COTTON,"up in a plantain leaf before breakfast, you--”"
5026,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5027,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Naturally burn the villages before lunch,” said Stalky."
5028,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5029,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Adam shook his head. “No troops,” he sighed. “I told my Chief about it,"
5030,A DEAL IN COTTON,and he said we must wait till they chopped a white man. He advised me if
5031,A DEAL IN COTTON,"ever I felt like it not to commit a--a barren felo de se, but to let the"
5032,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Sheshaheli do it. Then he could report, and then we could mop 'em up!”"
5033,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5034,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Most immoral! That's how we got--” Stalky quoted the name of a province
5035,A DEAL IN COTTON,won by just such a sacrifice.
5036,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5037,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Yes, but the beasts dominated one end of my cotton-belt like anything."
5038,A DEAL IN COTTON,They chivied me out of it when I went to take soil for analysis--me and
5039,A DEAL IN COTTON,Imam Din.”
5040,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5041,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Sahib! Is there a need?” The voice came out of the darkness, and the"
5042,A DEAL IN COTTON,eyes shone over Adam's shoulder ere it ceased.
5043,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5044,A DEAL IN COTTON,“None. The name was taken in talk.” Adam abolished him with a turn of
5045,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the finger. “I couldn't make a casus belli of it just then, because my"
5046,A DEAL IN COTTON,Chief had taken all the troops to hammer a gang of slave kings up north.
5047,A DEAL IN COTTON,Did you ever hear of our war against Ibn Makarrah? He precious nearly
5048,A DEAL IN COTTON,"lost us the Protectorate at one time, though he's an ally of ours now.”"
5049,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5050,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Wasn't he rather a pernicious brute, even as they go?” said Stalky."
5051,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Wade told me about him last year.”
5052,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5053,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Well, his nickname all through the country was 'The Merciful,' and he"
5054,A DEAL IN COTTON,didn't get that for nothing. None of our people ever breathed his
5055,A DEAL IN COTTON,"proper name. They said 'He' or 'That One,' and they didn't say it aloud,"
5056,A DEAL IN COTTON,either. He fought us for eight months.”
5057,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5058,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“I remember. There was a paragraph about it in one of the papers,” I"
5059,A DEAL IN COTTON,said.
5060,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5061,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“We broke him, though. No--the slavers don't come our way, because our"
5062,A DEAL IN COTTON,"men have the reputation of dying too much, the first month after they're"
5063,A DEAL IN COTTON,"captured. That knocks down profits, you see.”"
5064,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5065,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“What about your charming friends, the Sheshahelis?” said the Infant."
5066,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5067,A DEAL IN COTTON,“There's no market for Sheshaheli. People would as soon buy crocodiles.
5068,A DEAL IN COTTON,"I believe, before we annexed the country, Ibn Makarrah dropped down on"
5069,A DEAL IN COTTON,'em once--to train his young men--and simply hewed 'em in pieces.
5070,A DEAL IN COTTON,The bulk of my people are agriculturists--just the right stamp for
5071,A DEAL IN COTTON,cotton-growers. What's Mother playing?--'_Once in royal_'?”
5072,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5073,A DEAL IN COTTON,The organ that had been crooning as happily as a woman over her babe
5074,A DEAL IN COTTON,"restored, steadied to a tune."
5075,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5076,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Magnificent! Oh, magnificent!” said the Infant loyally. I had never"
5077,A DEAL IN COTTON,"heard him sing but once, and then, though it was early in the tolerant"
5078,A DEAL IN COTTON,"morning, his mess had rolled him into a lotus pond."
5079,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5080,A DEAL IN COTTON,“How did you get your cannibals to work for you?” asked Strickland.
5081,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5082,A DEAL IN COTTON,“They got converted to civilization after my Chief smashed Ibn
5083,A DEAL IN COTTON,Makarrah--just at the time I wanted 'em. You see my Chief had promised
5084,A DEAL IN COTTON,me in writing that if I could scrape up a surplus he would not bag it
5085,A DEAL IN COTTON,"for his roads this time, but I might have it for my cotton game. I only"
5086,A DEAL IN COTTON,needed two hundred pounds. Our revenues didn't run to it.”
5087,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5088,A DEAL IN COTTON,“What is your revenue?” Stalky asked in the vernacular.
5089,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5090,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“With hut-tax, traders' game and mining licenses, not more than fourteen"
5091,A DEAL IN COTTON,thousand rupees; every penny of it ear-marked months ahead.” Adam
5092,A DEAL IN COTTON,sighed.
5093,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5094,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Also there is a fine for dogs straying in the Sahib's camp. Last year
5095,A DEAL IN COTTON,"it exceeded three rupees,” Imam Din said quietly."
5096,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5097,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Well, I thought that was fair. They howled so. We were rather strict on"
5098,A DEAL IN COTTON,fines. I worked up my native clerk--Bulaki Ram--to a ferocious pitch
5099,A DEAL IN COTTON,of enthusiasm. He used to calculate the profits of our cotton-scheme
5100,A DEAL IN COTTON,"to three points of decimals, after office. I tell you I envied your"
5101,A DEAL IN COTTON,magistrates here hauling money out of motorists every week I had managed
5102,A DEAL IN COTTON,"to make our ordinary revenue and expenditure just about meet, and I"
5103,A DEAL IN COTTON,was crazy to get the odd two hundred pounds for my cotton. That sort of
5104,A DEAL IN COTTON,thing grows on a chap when he's alone--and talks aloud!”
5105,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5106,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Hul-lo! Have you been there already?” the father said, and Adam nodded."
5107,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5108,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Yes. Used to spout what I could remember of 'Marmion' to a tree, sir."
5109,A DEAL IN COTTON,Well then my luck turned. One evening an English-speaking nigger came in
5110,A DEAL IN COTTON,towing a corpse by the feet. (You get used to little things like that.)
5111,A DEAL IN COTTON,"He said he'd found it, and please would I identify, because if it"
5112,A DEAL IN COTTON,was one of Ibn Makarrah's men there might be a reward. It was an old
5113,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Mohammedan, with a strong dash of Arab--a smallboned, bald-headed chap,"
5114,A DEAL IN COTTON,and I was just wondering how it had kept so well in our climate when it
5115,A DEAL IN COTTON,sneezed. You ought to have seen the nigger! He fetched a howl and bolted
5116,A DEAL IN COTTON,"like--like the dog in 'Tom Sawyer,' when he sat on the what's-its-name"
5117,A DEAL IN COTTON,"beetle. He yelped as he ran, and the corpse went on sneezing. I could"
5118,A DEAL IN COTTON,"see it had been sarkied. (That's a sort of gum-poison, pater, which"
5119,A DEAL IN COTTON,attacks the nerve centres. Our chief medical officer is writing a
5120,A DEAL IN COTTON,"monograph about it.) So Imam Din and I emptied out the corpse one time,"
5121,A DEAL IN COTTON,"with my shaving soap and trade gunpowder, and hot water."
5122,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5123,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“I'd seen a case of sarkie before; so when the skin peeled off his feet,"
5124,A DEAL IN COTTON,"and he stopped sneezing, I knew he'd live. He was bad, though; lay like"
5125,A DEAL IN COTTON,a log for a week while Imam Din and I massaged the paralysis out of him.
5126,A DEAL IN COTTON,Then he told us he was a Hajji--had been three times to Mecca--come in
5127,A DEAL IN COTTON,"from French Africa, and that he'd met the nigger by the wayside--just"
5128,A DEAL IN COTTON,"like a case of thuggee, in India--and the nigger had poisoned him. That"
5129,A DEAL IN COTTON,seemed reasonable enough by what I knew of Coast niggers.”
5130,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5131,A DEAL IN COTTON,“You believed him?” said his father keenly.
5132,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5133,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“There was no reason I shouldn't. The nigger never came back, and the"
5134,A DEAL IN COTTON,"old man stayed with me for two months,” Adam returned. “You know what"
5135,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the best type of a Mohammedan gentleman can be, pater? He was that.”"
5136,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5137,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“None finer, none finer,” was the answer."
5138,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5139,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Except a Sikh,” Stalky grunted."
5140,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5141,A DEAL IN COTTON,“He'd been to Bombay; he knew French Africa inside out; he could quote
5142,A DEAL IN COTTON,poetry and the Koran all day long. He played chess--you don't know what
5143,A DEAL IN COTTON,that meant to me--like a master. We used to talk about the regeneration
5144,A DEAL IN COTTON,"of Turkey and the Sheik-ul-Islam between moves. Oh, everything under the"
5145,A DEAL IN COTTON,"sun we talked about! He was awfully open-minded. He believed in slavery,"
5146,A DEAL IN COTTON,"of course, but he quite saw that it would have to die out. That's why"
5147,A DEAL IN COTTON,he agreed with me about developing the resources of the district by
5148,A DEAL IN COTTON,"cotton-growing, you know.”"
5149,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5150,A DEAL IN COTTON,“You talked of that too?” said Strickland.
5151,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5152,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Rather. We discussed it for hours. You don't know what it meant to me.
5153,A DEAL IN COTTON,"A wonderful man. Imam Din, was not our Hajji marvellous?”"
5154,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5155,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Most marvellous! It was all through the Hajji that we found the money
5156,A DEAL IN COTTON,"for our cotton-play.” Imam Din had moved, I fancy, behind Strickland's"
5157,A DEAL IN COTTON,chair.
5158,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5159,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Yes. It must have been dead against his convictions too. He brought me
5160,A DEAL IN COTTON,news when I was down with fever at Dupé that one of Ibn Makarrah's men
5161,A DEAL IN COTTON,was parading through my District with a bunch of slaves--in the Fork!”
5162,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5163,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“What's the matter with the Fork, that you can't abide it?” said Stalky."
5164,A DEAL IN COTTON,Adam's voice had risen at the last word.
5165,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5166,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Local etiquette, sir,” he replied, too earnest to notice Stalky's"
5167,A DEAL IN COTTON,atrocious pun. “If a slaver runs slaves through British territory he
5168,A DEAL IN COTTON,ought to pretend that they're his servants. Hawkin' 'em about in the
5169,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Fork--the forked stick that you put round their necks, you know--is"
5170,A DEAL IN COTTON,"insolence--same as not backing your topsails in the old days. Besides,"
5171,A DEAL IN COTTON,it unsettles the District.”
5172,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5173,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“I thought you said slavers didn't come your way,” I put in."
5174,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5175,A DEAL IN COTTON,“They don't. But my Chief was smoking 'em out of the North all that
5176,A DEAL IN COTTON,"season, and they were bolting into French territory any road they could"
5177,A DEAL IN COTTON,"find. My orders were to take no notice so long as they circulated, but"
5178,A DEAL IN COTTON,"open slave-dealing in--the--Fork, was too much. I couldn't go myself, so I"
5179,A DEAL IN COTTON,told a couple of our Makalali police and Imam Din to make talk with
5180,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the gentleman one time. It was rather risky, and it might have been"
5181,A DEAL IN COTTON,"expensive, but it turned up trumps. They were back in a few days with"
5182,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the slaver (he didn't show fight) and a whole crowd of witnesses, and"
5183,A DEAL IN COTTON,"we tried him in my bedroom, and fined him properly. Just to show you"
5184,A DEAL IN COTTON,how demoralized the brute must have been (Arabs often go dotty after a
5185,A DEAL IN COTTON,"defeat), he'd snapped up four or five utterly useless Sheshaheli, and"
5186,A DEAL IN COTTON,"was offering 'em to all and sundry along the road. Why, he offered 'em"
5187,A DEAL IN COTTON,"to you, didn't he, Imam Din?”"
5188,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5189,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“I was witness that he offered man-eaters for sale,” said Imam Din."
5190,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5191,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Luckily for my cotton-scheme, that landed him both ways. You see, he"
5192,A DEAL IN COTTON,had slaved and exposed slaves for sale in British territory. That meant
5193,A DEAL IN COTTON,the double fine if I could get it out of him.”
5194,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5195,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“What was his defence?” said Strickland, late of the Punjab Police."
5196,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5197,A DEAL IN COTTON,“As far as I remember--but I had a temperature of 104 degrees at the
5198,A DEAL IN COTTON,time--he'd mistaken the meridians of longitude. Thought he was in French
5199,A DEAL IN COTTON,"territory. Said he'd never do it again, if we'd let him off with a fine."
5200,A DEAL IN COTTON,I could have shaken hands with the brute for that. He paid up cash like
5201,A DEAL IN COTTON,a motorist and went off one time.”
5202,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5203,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Did you see him?”
5204,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5205,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Ye-es. Didn't I, Imam Din?”"
5206,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5207,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Assuredly the Sahib both saw and spoke to the slaver. And the Sahib
5208,A DEAL IN COTTON,"also made a speech to the man-eaters when he freed them, and they swore"
5209,A DEAL IN COTTON,to supply him with labour for all his cotton-play. The Sahib leaned on
5210,A DEAL IN COTTON,his own servant's shoulder the while.”
5211,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5212,A DEAL IN COTTON,“I remember something of that. I remember Bulaki Ram giving me the
5213,A DEAL IN COTTON,"papers to sign, and I distinctly remember him locking up the money in"
5214,A DEAL IN COTTON,the safe--two hundred and ten beautiful English sovereigns. You don't
5215,A DEAL IN COTTON,know what that meant to me! I believe it cured my fever; and as soon
5216,A DEAL IN COTTON,"as I could, I staggered off with the Hajji to interview the Sheshaheli"
5217,A DEAL IN COTTON,about labour. Then I found out why they had been so keen to work! It
5218,A DEAL IN COTTON,wasn't gratitude. Their big village had been hit by lightning and burned
5219,A DEAL IN COTTON,"out a week or two before, and they lay flat in rows around me asking me"
5220,A DEAL IN COTTON,for a job. I gave it 'em.”
5221,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5222,A DEAL IN COTTON,“And so you were very happy?” His mother had stolen up behind us. “You
5223,A DEAL IN COTTON,"liked your cotton, dear?” She tidied the lump away."
5224,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5225,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“By Jove, I was happy!” Adam yawned. “Now if any one,” he looked at"
5226,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the Infant, “cares to put a little money into the scheme, it'll be the"
5227,A DEAL IN COTTON,"making of my District. I can't give you figures, sir, but I assure--”"
5228,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5229,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“You'll take your arsenic, and Imam Din'll take you up to bed, and I'll"
5230,A DEAL IN COTTON,come and tuck you in.”
5231,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5232,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Agnes leaned forward, her rounded elbows on his shoulders, hands joined"
5233,A DEAL IN COTTON,"across his dark hair, and “Isn't he a darling?” she said to us, with"
5234,A DEAL IN COTTON,just the same heart-rending lift to the left eyebrow and the same break
5235,A DEAL IN COTTON,of her voice as sent Strickland mad among the horses in the year '84. We
5236,A DEAL IN COTTON,were quiet when they were gone. We waited till Imam Din returned to us
5237,A DEAL IN COTTON,"from above and coughed at the door, as only dark-hearted Asia can."
5238,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5239,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Now,” said Strickland, “tell us what truly befell, son of my servant.”"
5240,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5241,A DEAL IN COTTON,“All befell as our Sahib has said. Only--only there was an
5242,A DEAL IN COTTON,arrangement--a little arrangement on account of his cotton-play.”
5243,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5244,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Tell! Sit! I beg your pardon, Infant,” said Strickland."
5245,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5246,A DEAL IN COTTON,"But the Infant had already made the sign, and we heard Imam Din hunker"
5247,A DEAL IN COTTON,down on the floor: One gets little out of the East at attention.
5248,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5249,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“When the fever came on our Sahib in our roofed house at Dupé,” he"
5250,A DEAL IN COTTON,"began, “the Hajji listened intently to his talk. He expected the names"
5251,A DEAL IN COTTON,of women; though I had already told him that Our virtue was beyond
5252,A DEAL IN COTTON,"belief or compare, and that Our sole desire was this cotton-play. Being"
5253,A DEAL IN COTTON,"at last convinced, the Hajji breathed on our Sahib's forehead, to sink"
5254,A DEAL IN COTTON,into his brain news concerning a slave-dealer in his district who had
5255,A DEAL IN COTTON,"made a mock of the law. Sahib,” Imam Din turned to Strickland, “our"
5256,A DEAL IN COTTON,Sahib answered to those false words as a horse of blood answers to
5257,A DEAL IN COTTON,the spur. He sat up. He issued orders for the apprehension of the
5258,A DEAL IN COTTON,slavedealer. Then he fell back. Then we left him.”
5259,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5260,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Alone--servant of my son, and son of my servant?” said his father."
5261,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5262,A DEAL IN COTTON,“There was an old woman which belonged to the Hajji. She had come in
5263,A DEAL IN COTTON,"with the Hajji's money-belt. The Hajji told her that if our Sahib died,"
5264,A DEAL IN COTTON,she would die with him. And truly our Sahib had given me orders to
5265,A DEAL IN COTTON,depart.”
5266,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5267,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Being mad with fever--eh?”
5268,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5269,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“What could we do, Sahib? This cotton-play was his heart's desire. He"
5270,A DEAL IN COTTON,talked of it in his fever. Therefore it was his heart's desire that
5271,A DEAL IN COTTON,the Hajji went to fetch. Doubtless the Hajji could have given him money
5272,A DEAL IN COTTON,enough out of hand for ten cotton-plays; but in this respect also our
5273,A DEAL IN COTTON,Sahib's virtue was beyond belief or compare. Great Ones do not exchange
5274,A DEAL IN COTTON,moneys. Therefore the Hajji said--and I helped with my counsel--that we
5275,A DEAL IN COTTON,must make arrangements to get the money in all respects conformable with
5276,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the English Law. It was great trouble to us, but--the Law is the Law."
5277,A DEAL IN COTTON,And the Hajji showed the old woman the knife by which she would die if
5278,A DEAL IN COTTON,our Sahib died. So I accompanied the Hajji.”
5279,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5280,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Knowing who he was?” said Strickland.
5281,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5282,A DEAL IN COTTON,“No! Fearing the man. A virtue went out from him overbearing the virtue
5283,A DEAL IN COTTON,of lesser persons. The Hajji told Bulaki Ram the clerk to occupy the
5284,A DEAL IN COTTON,"seat of government at Dupé till our return. Bulaki Ram feared the Hajji,"
5285,A DEAL IN COTTON,because the Hajji had often gloatingly appraised his skill in figures
5286,A DEAL IN COTTON,at five thousand rupees upon any slave-block. The Hajji then said to
5287,A DEAL IN COTTON,"me: 'Come, and we will make the man-eaters play the cotton-game for my"
5288,A DEAL IN COTTON,delight's delight.' The Hajji loved our Sahib with the love of a father
5289,A DEAL IN COTTON,"for his son, of a saved for his saviour, of a Great One for a Great One."
5290,A DEAL IN COTTON,But I said: 'We cannot go to that Sheshaheli place without a hundred
5291,A DEAL IN COTTON,rifles. We have here five.' The Hajji said: 'I have untied as knot in my
5292,A DEAL IN COTTON,head-handkerchief which will be more to us than a thousand.' I saw that
5293,A DEAL IN COTTON,he had so loosed it that it lay flagwise on his shoulder. Then I knew
5294,A DEAL IN COTTON,that he was a Great One with virtue in him.
5295,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5296,A DEAL IN COTTON,“We came to the highlands of the Sheshaheli on the dawn of the second
5297,A DEAL IN COTTON,day--about the time of the stirring of the cold wind. The Hajji walked
5298,A DEAL IN COTTON,"delicately across the open place where their filth is, and scratched"
5299,A DEAL IN COTTON,upon the gate which was shut. When it opened I saw the man-eaters lying
5300,A DEAL IN COTTON,on their cots under the eaves of the huts. They rolled off: they rose
5301,A DEAL IN COTTON,"up, one behind the other the length of the street, and the fear on their"
5302,A DEAL IN COTTON,faces was as leaves whitening to a breeze. The Hajji stood in the gate
5303,A DEAL IN COTTON,guarding his skirts from defilement. The Hajji said: 'I am here once
5304,A DEAL IN COTTON,again. Give me six and yoke up.' They zealously then pushed to us with
5305,A DEAL IN COTTON,"poles six, and yoked them with a heavy tree. The Hajji then said: 'Fetch"
5306,A DEAL IN COTTON,"fire from the morning hearth, and come to windward.' The wind is strong"
5307,A DEAL IN COTTON,"on those headlands at sunrise, so when each had emptied his crock of"
5308,A DEAL IN COTTON,"fire in front of that which was before him, the broadside of the town"
5309,A DEAL IN COTTON,"roared into flame, and all went. The Hajji then said: 'At the end of"
5310,A DEAL IN COTTON,a time there will come here the white man ye once chased for sport. He
5311,A DEAL IN COTTON,"will demand labour to plant such and such stuff. Ye are that labour, and"
5312,A DEAL IN COTTON,"your spawn after you.' They said, lifting their heads a very little from"
5313,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the edge of the ashes: 'We are that labour, and our spawn after us.'"
5314,A DEAL IN COTTON,The Hajji said: 'What is also my name?' They said: 'Thy name is also
5315,A DEAL IN COTTON,The Merciful.' The Hajji said: 'Praise then my mercy'; and while they did
5316,A DEAL IN COTTON,"this, the Hajji walked away, I following.”"
5317,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5318,A DEAL IN COTTON,"The Infant made some noise in his throat, and reached for more Burgundy."
5319,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5320,A DEAL IN COTTON,“About noon one of our six fell dead. Fright only frights Sahib! None
5321,A DEAL IN COTTON,"had--none could--touch him. Since they were in pairs, and the other of"
5322,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the Fork was mad and sang foolishly, we waited for some heathen to do"
5323,A DEAL IN COTTON,what was needful. There came at last Angari men with goats. The Hajji
5324,A DEAL IN COTTON,"said: 'What do ye see? They said: 'Oh, our Lord, we neither see nor"
5325,A DEAL IN COTTON,hear.' The Hajji said: 'But I command ye to see and to hear and to say.'
5326,A DEAL IN COTTON,"They said: 'Oh, our Lord, it is to our commanded eyes as though slaves"
5327,A DEAL IN COTTON,stood in a Fork.' The Hajji said: 'So testify before the officer who
5328,A DEAL IN COTTON,waits you in the town of Dupé.' They said: 'What shall come to us
5329,A DEAL IN COTTON,after?' The Hajji said: 'The just reward for the informer. But if ye do
5330,A DEAL IN COTTON,"not testify, then a punishment which shall cause birds to fall from"
5331,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the trees in terror and monkeys to scream for pity.' Hearing this,"
5332,A DEAL IN COTTON,the Angari men hastened to Dupé. The Hajji then said to me: 'Are those
5333,A DEAL IN COTTON,"things sufficient to establish our case, or must I drive in a village"
5334,A DEAL IN COTTON,"full?' I said that three witnesses amply established any case, but as"
5335,A DEAL IN COTTON,"yet, I said, the Hajji had not offered his slaves for sale. It is true,"
5336,A DEAL IN COTTON,"as our Sahib said just now, there is one fine for catching slaves, and"
5337,A DEAL IN COTTON,yet another for making to sell them. And it was the double fine that
5338,A DEAL IN COTTON,"we needed, Sahib, for our Sahib's cotton-play. We had fore-arranged"
5339,A DEAL IN COTTON,"all this with Bulaki Ram, who knows the English Law, and, I thought the"
5340,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Hajji remembered, but he grew angry, and cried out: 'O God, Refuge of"
5341,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the Afflicted, must I, who am what I am, peddle this dog's meat by the"
5342,A DEAL IN COTTON,"roadside to gain his delight for my heart's delight?' None the less, he"
5343,A DEAL IN COTTON,"admitted it was the English Law, and so he offered me the six--five--in"
5344,A DEAL IN COTTON,"a small voice, with an averted head. The Sheshaheli do not smell of sour"
5345,A DEAL IN COTTON,"milk as heathen should. They smell like leopards, Sahib. This is because"
5346,A DEAL IN COTTON,they eat men.”
5347,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5348,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Maybe,” said Strickland. “But where were thy wits? One witness is not"
5349,A DEAL IN COTTON,sufficient to establish the fact of a sale.”
5350,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5351,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“What could we do, Sahib? There was the Hajji's reputation to consider."
5352,A DEAL IN COTTON,"We could not have called in a heathen witness for such a thing. And,"
5353,A DEAL IN COTTON,"moreover, the Sahib forgets that the defendant himself was making this"
5354,A DEAL IN COTTON,"case. He would not contest his own evidence. Otherwise, I know the law"
5355,A DEAL IN COTTON,of evidence well enough.
5356,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5357,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“So then we went to Dupé, and while Bulaki Ram waited among the Angari"
5358,A DEAL IN COTTON,"men, I ran to see our Sahib in bed. His eyes were very bright, and his"
5359,A DEAL IN COTTON,"mouth was full of upside-down orders, but the old woman had not loosened"
5360,A DEAL IN COTTON,her hair for death. The Hajji said: 'Be quick with my trial. I am not
5361,A DEAL IN COTTON,Job!' The Hajji was a learned man. We made the trial swiftly to a sound
5362,A DEAL IN COTTON,"of soothing voices round the bed. Yet--yet, because no man can be sure"
5363,A DEAL IN COTTON,"whether a Sahib of that blood sees, or does not see, we made it strictly"
5364,A DEAL IN COTTON,in the manner of the forms of the English Law. Only the witnesses and
5365,A DEAL IN COTTON,the slaves and the prisoner we kept without for his nose's sake.”
5366,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5367,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Then he did not see the prisoner?” said Strickland.
5368,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5369,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“I stood by to shackle up an Angari in case he should demand it, but by"
5370,A DEAL IN COTTON,God's favour he was too far fevered to ask for one. It is quite true
5371,A DEAL IN COTTON,he signed the papers. It is quite true he saw the money put away in the
5372,A DEAL IN COTTON,safe--two hundred and ten English pounds and it is quite true that the
5373,A DEAL IN COTTON,"gold wrought on him as a strong cure. But as to his seeing the prisoner,"
5374,A DEAL IN COTTON,and having speech with the man-eaters--the Hajji breathed all that on
5375,A DEAL IN COTTON,"his forehead to sink into his sick brain. A little, as ye have heard,"
5376,A DEAL IN COTTON,"has remained.... Ah, but when the fever broke, and our Sahib called"
5377,A DEAL IN COTTON,"for the fine-book, and the thin little picture-books from Europe with"
5378,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the pictures of ploughs and hoes, and cotton-mills--ah, then he"
5379,A DEAL IN COTTON,"laughed as he used to laugh, Sahib. It was his heart's desire, this"
5380,A DEAL IN COTTON,"cotton-play. The Hajji loved him, as who does not? It was a little,"
5381,A DEAL IN COTTON,"little arrangement, Sahib, of which--is it necessary to tell all the"
5382,A DEAL IN COTTON,world?”
5383,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5384,A DEAL IN COTTON,“And when didst thou know who the Hajji was?” said Strickland.
5385,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5386,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Not for a certainty till he and our Sahib had returned from their
5387,A DEAL IN COTTON,"visit to the Sheshaheli country. It is quite true as our Sahib says, the"
5388,A DEAL IN COTTON,"man-eaters lay flat around his feet, and asked for spades to cultivate"
5389,A DEAL IN COTTON,"cotton. That very night, when I was cooking the dinner, the Hajji said"
5390,A DEAL IN COTTON,"to me: 'I go to my own place, though God knows whether the Man with the"
5391,A DEAL IN COTTON,"Stone Eyes have left me an ox, a slave, or a woman.' I said: 'Thou art"
5392,A DEAL IN COTTON,then That One?' The Hajji said: 'I am ten thousand rupees reward into
5393,A DEAL IN COTTON,thy hand. Shall we make another law-case and get more cotton machines
5394,A DEAL IN COTTON,for the boy?' I said: 'What dog am I to do this? May God prolong thy
5395,A DEAL IN COTTON,life a thousand years!' The Hajji said: 'Who has seen to-morrow? God has
5396,A DEAL IN COTTON,"given me as it were a son in my old age, and I praise Him. See that the"
5397,A DEAL IN COTTON,breed is not lost!'
5398,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5399,A DEAL IN COTTON,“He walked then from the cooking-place to our Sahib's office-table under
5400,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the tree, where our Sahib held in his hand a blue envelope of Service"
5401,A DEAL IN COTTON,"newly come in by runner from the North. At this, fearing evil news for"
5402,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the Hajji, I would have restrained him, but he said: 'We be both Great"
5403,A DEAL IN COTTON,Ones. Neither of us will fail.' Our Sahib looked up to invite the Hajji
5404,A DEAL IN COTTON,"to approach before he opened the letter, but the Hajji stood off till"
5405,A DEAL IN COTTON,our Sahib had well opened and well read the letter. Then the Hajji said:
5406,A DEAL IN COTTON,'Is it permitted to say farewell?' Our Sahib stabbed the letter on the
5407,A DEAL IN COTTON,file with a deep and joyful breath and cried a welcome. The Hajji said:
5408,A DEAL IN COTTON,"'I go to my own place,' and he loosed from his neck a chained heart"
5409,A DEAL IN COTTON,of ambergris set in soft gold and held it forth. Our Sahib snatched
5410,A DEAL IN COTTON,"it swiftly in the closed fist, down turned, and said 'If thy name be"
5411,A DEAL IN COTTON,"written hereon, it is needless, for a name is already engraved on my"
5412,A DEAL IN COTTON,heart.' The Hajji said: 'And on mine also is a name engraved; but there
5413,A DEAL IN COTTON,"is no name on the amulet.' The Hajji stooped to our Sahib's feet, but"
5414,A DEAL IN COTTON,"our Sahib raised and embraced him, and the Hajji covered his mouth with"
5415,A DEAL IN COTTON,"his shoulder-cloth, because it worked, and so he went away.”"
5416,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5417,A DEAL IN COTTON,“And what order was in the Service letter?” Stalky murmured.
5418,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5419,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Only an order for our Sahib to write a report on some new cattle
5420,A DEAL IN COTTON,sickness. But all orders come in the same make of envelope. We could not
5421,A DEAL IN COTTON,tell what order it might have been.”
5422,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5423,A DEAL IN COTTON,“When he opened the letter--my son--made he no sign? A cough? An oath?”
5424,A DEAL IN COTTON,Strickland asked.
5425,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5426,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“None, Sahib. I watched his hands. They did not shake. Afterward he"
5427,A DEAL IN COTTON,"wiped his face, but he was sweating before from the heat.”"
5428,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5429,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Did he know? Did he know who the Hajji was?” said the Infant in
5430,A DEAL IN COTTON,English.
5431,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5432,A DEAL IN COTTON,“I am a poor man. Who can say what a Sahib of that get knows or does not
5433,A DEAL IN COTTON,know? But the Hajji is right. The breed should not be lost. It is not
5434,A DEAL IN COTTON,"very hot for little children in Dupé, and as regards nurses, my sister's"
5435,A DEAL IN COTTON,cousin at Jull--”
5436,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5437,A DEAL IN COTTON,“H'm! That is the boy's own concern. I wonder if his Chief ever knew?”
5438,A DEAL IN COTTON,said Strickland.
5439,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5440,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Assuredly,” said Imam Din. “On the night before our Sahib went down to"
5441,A DEAL IN COTTON,"the sea, the Great Sahib--the Man with the Stone Eyes--dined with him in"
5442,A DEAL IN COTTON,"his camp, I being in charge of the table. They talked a long while and"
5443,A DEAL IN COTTON,the Great Sahib said: 'What didst thou think of That One?' (We do not
5444,A DEAL IN COTTON,say Ibn Makarrah yonder.) Our Sahib said: 'Which one?' The Great Sahib
5445,A DEAL IN COTTON,said: 'That One which taught thy man-eaters to grow cotton for thee. He
5446,A DEAL IN COTTON,"was in thy District three months to my certain knowledge, and I looked"
5447,A DEAL IN COTTON,by every runner that thou wouldst send me in his head.' Our Sahib said:
5448,A DEAL IN COTTON,"'If his head had been needed, another man should have been appointed to"
5449,A DEAL IN COTTON,"govern my District, for he was my friend.' The Great Sahib laughed and"
5450,A DEAL IN COTTON,said: 'If I had needed a lesser man in thy place be sure I would have
5451,A DEAL IN COTTON,"sent him, as, if I had needed the head of That One, be sure I would have"
5452,A DEAL IN COTTON,"sent men to bring it to me. But tell me now, by what means didst thou"
5453,A DEAL IN COTTON,twist him to thy use and our profit in this cotton-play?' Our Sahib
5454,A DEAL IN COTTON,"said: 'By God, I did not use that man in any fashion whatever. He was"
5455,A DEAL IN COTTON,my friend.' The Great Sahib said: 'Toh Vac! (Bosh!) Tell!' Our Sahib
5456,A DEAL IN COTTON,shook his head as he does--as he did when a child--and they looked at
5457,A DEAL IN COTTON,each other like sword-play men in the ring at a fair. The Great Sahib
5458,A DEAL IN COTTON,dropped his eyes first and he said: 'So be it. I should perhaps have
5459,A DEAL IN COTTON,answered thus in my youth. No matter. I have made treaty with That One
5460,A DEAL IN COTTON,as an ally of the State. Some day he shall tell me the tale.' Then I
5461,A DEAL IN COTTON,"brought in fresh coffee, and they ceased. But I do not think That One"
5462,A DEAL IN COTTON,will tell the Great Sahib more than our Sahib told him.”
5463,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5464,A DEAL IN COTTON,“Wherefore?” I asked.
5465,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5466,A DEAL IN COTTON,"“Because they are both Great Ones, and I have observed in my life"
5467,A DEAL IN COTTON,that Great Ones employ words very little between each other in their
5468,A DEAL IN COTTON,dealings; still less when they speak to a third concerning those
5469,A DEAL IN COTTON,dealings. Also they profit by silence.... Now I think that the
5470,A DEAL IN COTTON,"mother has come down from the room, and I will go rub his feet till he"
5471,A DEAL IN COTTON,sleeps.”
5472,A DEAL IN COTTON,
5473,A DEAL IN COTTON,His ears had caught Agnes's step at the stair-head and presently she
5474,A DEAL IN COTTON,passed us on her way to the music room humming the Magnificat.

5533,THE PUZZLER,
5534,THE PUZZLER,"I had not seen Penfentenyou since the Middle Nineties, when he was"
5535,THE PUZZLER,Minister of Ways and Woodsides in De Thouar's first Administration. Last
5536,THE PUZZLER,"summer, though he nominally held the same portfolio, he was his Colony's"
5537,THE PUZZLER,"Premier in all but name, and the idol of his own province, which is two"
5538,THE PUZZLER,"and a half times the size of England. Politically, his creed was his"
5539,THE PUZZLER,growing country; and he came over to England to develop a Great Idea in
5540,THE PUZZLER,her behalf.
5541,THE PUZZLER,
5542,THE PUZZLER,"Believing that he had put it in train, I made haste to welcome him to my"
5543,THE PUZZLER,house for a week.
5544,THE PUZZLER,
5545,THE PUZZLER,That he was chased to my door by his own Agent-General in a motor; that
5546,THE PUZZLER,they turned my study into a Cabinet Meeting which I was not invited to
5547,THE PUZZLER,attend; that the local telegraph all but broke down beneath the strain
5548,THE PUZZLER,of hundred word coded cables; and that I practically broke into the
5549,THE PUZZLER,"house of a stranger to get him telephonic facilities on a Sunday, are"
5550,THE PUZZLER,"things I overlook. What I objected to was his ingratitude, while I thus"
5551,THE PUZZLER,tore up England to help him. So I said: “Why on earth didn't you see
5552,THE PUZZLER,your Opposite Number in Town instead of bringing your office work here?”
5553,THE PUZZLER,
5554,THE PUZZLER,"“Eh? Who?” said he, looking up from his fourth cable since lunch."
5555,THE PUZZLER,
5556,THE PUZZLER,“See the English Minister for Ways and Woodsides.”
5557,THE PUZZLER,
5558,THE PUZZLER,"“I saw him,” said Penfentenyou, without enthusiasm."
5559,THE PUZZLER,
5560,THE PUZZLER,"It seemed that he had called twice on the gentleman, but without an"
5561,THE PUZZLER,"appointment--(“I thought if I wasn't big enough, my business was”)--and"
5562,THE PUZZLER,"each time had found him engaged. A third party intervening, suggested"
5563,THE PUZZLER,that a meeting might be arranged if due notice were given.
5564,THE PUZZLER,
5565,THE PUZZLER,"“Then,” said Penfentenyou, “I called at the office at ten o'clock.”"
5566,THE PUZZLER,
5567,THE PUZZLER,"“But they'd be in bed,” I cried."
5568,THE PUZZLER,
5569,THE PUZZLER,“One of the babies was awake. He told me that--that 'my sort of
5570,THE PUZZLER,questions'”--he slapped the pile of cables--“were only taken between 11
5571,THE PUZZLER,and 2 P.M. So I waited.”
5572,THE PUZZLER,
5573,THE PUZZLER,“And when you got to business?” I asked.
5574,THE PUZZLER,
5575,THE PUZZLER,He made a gesture of despair. “It was like talking to children. They'd
5576,THE PUZZLER,never heard of it.”
5577,THE PUZZLER,
5578,THE PUZZLER,“And your Opposite Number?”
5579,THE PUZZLER,
5580,THE PUZZLER,Penfentenyou described him.
5581,THE PUZZLER,
5582,THE PUZZLER,“Hush! You mustn't talk like that!” I shuddered. “He's one of the best
5583,THE PUZZLER,of good fellows. You should meet him socially.”
5584,THE PUZZLER,
5585,THE PUZZLER,"“I've done that too,” he said. “Have you?”"
5586,THE PUZZLER,
5587,THE PUZZLER,“Heaven forbid!” I cried; “but that's the proper thing to say.”
5588,THE PUZZLER,
5589,THE PUZZLER,"“Oh, he said all the proper things. Only I thought as this was England"
5590,THE PUZZLER,that they'd more or less have the hang of all the--general hang-together
5591,THE PUZZLER,of my Idea. But I had to explain it from the beginning.”
5592,THE PUZZLER,
5593,THE PUZZLER,"“Ah! They'd probably mislaid the papers,” I said, and I told him"
5594,THE PUZZLER,the story of a three-million pound insurrection caused by a deputy
5595,THE PUZZLER,Under-Secretary sitting upon a mass of green-labelled correspondence
5596,THE PUZZLER,instead of reading it.
5597,THE PUZZLER,
5598,THE PUZZLER,"“I wonder it doesn't happen every week,” he answered. “D'you mind my"
5599,THE PUZZLER,"having the Agent-General to dinner again tonight? I'll wire, and he can"
5600,THE PUZZLER,motor down.”
5601,THE PUZZLER,
5602,THE PUZZLER,"The Agent-General arrived two hours later, a patient and expostulating"
5603,THE PUZZLER,"person, visibly torn between the pulling Devil of a rampant Colony,"
5604,THE PUZZLER,and the placid Baker of a largely uninterested England. But with
5605,THE PUZZLER,Penfentenyou behind him he had worked; for he told us that Lord
5606,THE PUZZLER,Lundie--the Law Lord was--the final authority on the legal and
5607,THE PUZZLER,"constitutional aspects of the Great Idea, and to him it must be"
5608,THE PUZZLER,referred.
5609,THE PUZZLER,
5610,THE PUZZLER,“Good Heavens alive!” thundered Penfentenyou. “I told you to get that
5611,THE PUZZLER,settled last Christmas.”
5612,THE PUZZLER,
5613,THE PUZZLER,"“It was the middle of the house-party season,” said the Agent-General"
5614,THE PUZZLER,mildly. “Lord Lundie's at Credence Green now--he spends his holidays
5615,THE PUZZLER,there. It's only forty miles off.”
5616,THE PUZZLER,
5617,THE PUZZLER,“Shan't I disturb his Holiness?” said Penfentenyou heavily. “Perhaps
5618,THE PUZZLER,"'my sort of questions,”' he snorted, “mayn't be discussed except at"
5619,THE PUZZLER,midnight.”
5620,THE PUZZLER,
5621,THE PUZZLER,"“Oh, don't be a child,” I said."
5622,THE PUZZLER,
5623,THE PUZZLER,"“What this country needs,” said Penfentenyou, “is--” and for ten minutes"
5624,THE PUZZLER,he trumpeted rebellion.
5625,THE PUZZLER,
5626,THE PUZZLER,"“What you need is to pay for your own protection,” I cut in when he"
5627,THE PUZZLER,"drew breath, and I showed him a yellowish paper, supplied gratis by"
5628,THE PUZZLER,"Government, which is called Schedule D. To my merciless delight he had"
5629,THE PUZZLER,"never seen the thing before, and I completed my victory over him and"
5630,THE PUZZLER,all the Colonies with a Brassey's “Naval Annual” and a “Statesman's Year
5631,THE PUZZLER,Book.”
5632,THE PUZZLER,
5633,THE PUZZLER,The Agent-General interposed with agent-generalities (but they were
5634,THE PUZZLER,merely provocateurs) about Ties of Sentiment.
5635,THE PUZZLER,
5636,THE PUZZLER,“They be blowed!” said Penfentenyou. “What's the good of sentiment
5637,THE PUZZLER,towards a Kindergarten?”
5638,THE PUZZLER,
5639,THE PUZZLER,“Quite so. Ties of common funk are the things that bind us together; and
5640,THE PUZZLER,the sooner you new nations realize it the better. What you need is an
5641,THE PUZZLER,annual invasion. Then you'd grow up.”
5642,THE PUZZLER,
5643,THE PUZZLER,“Thank you! Thank you!” said the Agent-General. “That's what I am always
5644,THE PUZZLER,trying to tell my people.”
5645,THE PUZZLER,
5646,THE PUZZLER,"“But, my dear fool,” Penfentenyou almost wept, “do you pretend that"
5647,THE PUZZLER,these banana-fingered amateurs at home are grown up?”
5648,THE PUZZLER,
5649,THE PUZZLER,"“You poor, serious, pagan man,” I retorted, “if you take 'em that way,"
5650,THE PUZZLER,you'll wreck your Great Idea.”
5651,THE PUZZLER,
5652,THE PUZZLER,“Will you take him to Lord Lundie's to-morrow?” said the Agent-General
5653,THE PUZZLER,promptly.
5654,THE PUZZLER,
5655,THE PUZZLER,"“I suppose I must,” I said, “if you won't.”"
5656,THE PUZZLER,
5657,THE PUZZLER,"“Not me! I'm going home,” said the Agent-General, and departed. I am"
5658,THE PUZZLER,glad that I am no colony's Agent-General.
5659,THE PUZZLER,
5660,THE PUZZLER,Penfentenyou continued to argue about naval contributions till 1.15
5661,THE PUZZLER,"A.M., though I was victor from the first."
5662,THE PUZZLER,
5663,THE PUZZLER,"At ten o'clock I got him and his correspondence into the motor, and"
5664,THE PUZZLER,he had the decency to ask whether he had been unpolished over-night.
5665,THE PUZZLER,I replied that I waited an apology. This he made excuse for renewed
5666,THE PUZZLER,"arguments, and used wayside shows as illustrations of the decadence of"
5667,THE PUZZLER,England.
5668,THE PUZZLER,
5669,THE PUZZLER,"For example we burst a tyre within a mile of Credence Green, and, to"
5670,THE PUZZLER,"save time, walked into the beautifully kept little village. His eye was"
5671,THE PUZZLER,"caught by a building of pale-blue tin, stencilled “Calvinist Chapel,”"
5672,THE PUZZLER,before whose shuttered windows an Italian organ-grinder with a
5673,THE PUZZLER,petticoated monkey was playing “Dolly Grey.”
5674,THE PUZZLER,
5675,THE PUZZLER,“Yes. That's it!” snapped the egoist. “That's a parable of the general
5676,THE PUZZLER,situation in England. And look at those brutes!” A huge household
5677,THE PUZZLER,removals van was halted at a public-house. The men in charge were
5678,THE PUZZLER,"drinking beer from blue and white mugs. It seemed to me a pretty sight,"
5679,THE PUZZLER,but Penfentenyou said it represented Our National Attitude.
5680,THE PUZZLER,
5681,THE PUZZLER,"Lord Lundie's summer resting-place we learned was a farm, a little out"
5682,THE PUZZLER,"of the village, up a hill round which curled a high hedged road. Only"
5683,THE PUZZLER,"an initiated few spend their holidays at Credence Green, and they have"
5684,THE PUZZLER,trained the householders to keep the place select. Penfentenyou made a
5685,THE PUZZLER,"grievance of this as we walked up the lane, followed at a distance by"
5686,THE PUZZLER,the organ-grinder.
5687,THE PUZZLER,
5688,THE PUZZLER,"“Suppose he is having a house-party,” he said: “Anything's possible in"
5689,THE PUZZLER,this insane land.”
5690,THE PUZZLER,
5691,THE PUZZLER,Just at that minute we found ourselves opposite an empty villa. Its roof
5692,THE PUZZLER,"was of black slate, with bright unweathered ridge-tiling; its walls were"
5693,THE PUZZLER,"of blood-coloured brick, cornered and banded with vermiculated stucco"
5694,THE PUZZLER,"work, and there was cobalt, magenta, and purest apple-green window-glass"
5695,THE PUZZLER,on either side of the front door. The whole was fenced from the road by
5696,THE PUZZLER,"a low, brick-pillared, flint wall, topped with a cast-iron Gothic rail,"
5697,THE PUZZLER,picked out in blue and gold.
5698,THE PUZZLER,
5699,THE PUZZLER,"Tight beds of geranium, calceolaria, and lobelia speckled the"
5700,THE PUZZLER,"glass-plat, from whose centre rose one of the finest araucarias (its"
5701,THE PUZZLER,other name by the way is “monkey-puzzler”) that it has ever been my
5702,THE PUZZLER,"lot to see. It must have been full thirty feet high, and its foliage"
5703,THE PUZZLER,"exquisitely answered the iron railings. Such bijou ne plus ultras,"
5704,THE PUZZLER,"replete with all the amenities, do not, as I pointed out to"
5705,THE PUZZLER,"Penfentenyou, transpire outside of England."
5706,THE PUZZLER,
5707,THE PUZZLER,"A hedge, swinging sharp right, flanked the garden, and above it on"
5708,THE PUZZLER,a slope of daisy-dotted meadows we could see Lord Lundie's tiled and
5709,THE PUZZLER,half-timbered summer farmhouse. Of a sudden we heard voices behind the
5710,THE PUZZLER,"tree--the fine full tones of the unembarrassed English, speaking to"
5711,THE PUZZLER,their equals--that tore through the hedge like sleet through rafters.
5712,THE PUZZLER,
5713,THE PUZZLER,"“That it is not called 'monkey-puzzler' for nothing, I willingly"
5714,THE PUZZLER,concede”--this was a rich and rolling note--“but on the other hand--”
5715,THE PUZZLER,
5716,THE PUZZLER,"“I submit, me lud, that the name implies that it might, could, would,"
5717,THE PUZZLER,"or should be ascended by a monkey, and not that the ascent is a physical"
5718,THE PUZZLER,impossibility. I believe one of our South American spider monkeys
5719,THE PUZZLER,"wouldn't hesitate... By Jove, it might be worth trying, if--”"
5720,THE PUZZLER,
5721,THE PUZZLER,"This was a crisper voice than the first. A third, higher-pitched, and"
5722,THE PUZZLER,"full of pleasant affectations, broke in."
5723,THE PUZZLER,
5724,THE PUZZLER,"“Oh, practical men, there is no ape here. Why do you waste one of God's"
5725,THE PUZZLER,own days on unprofitable discussion? Give me a match!”
5726,THE PUZZLER,
5727,THE PUZZLER,"“I've a good mind to make you demonstrate in your own person. Come on,"
5728,THE PUZZLER,Bubbles! We'll make Jimmy climb!”
5729,THE PUZZLER,
5730,THE PUZZLER,"There was a sound of scuffling, broken by squeaks from Jimmy of the high"
5731,THE PUZZLER,voice. I turned back and drew Penfentenyou into the side of the flanking
5732,THE PUZZLER,hedge. I remembered to have read in a society paper that Lord Lundie's
5733,THE PUZZLER,lesser name was “Bubbles.”
5734,THE PUZZLER,
5735,THE PUZZLER,“What are they doing?” Penfentenyou said sharply. “Drunk?”
5736,THE PUZZLER,
5737,THE PUZZLER,"“Just playing! Superabundant vitality of the Race, you know. We'll watch"
5738,THE PUZZLER,"'em,” I answered. The noise ceased."
5739,THE PUZZLER,
5740,THE PUZZLER,"“My deliver,” Jimmy gasped. “The ram caught in the thicket, and--I'm the"
5741,THE PUZZLER,only one who can talk Neapolitan! Leggo my collar!” He cried aloud in a
5742,THE PUZZLER,"foreign tongue, and was answered from the gate."
5743,THE PUZZLER,
5744,THE PUZZLER,"“It's the Calvinistic organ-grinder,” I whispered. I had already found"
5745,THE PUZZLER,a practicable break at the bottom of the hedge. “They're going to try to
5746,THE PUZZLER,"make the monkey climb, I believe.”"
5747,THE PUZZLER,
5748,THE PUZZLER,"“Here--let me look!” Penfentenyou flung himself down, and rooted till he"
5749,THE PUZZLER,too broke a peep-hole. We lay side by side commanding the entire garden
5750,THE PUZZLER,at ten yards' range.
5751,THE PUZZLER,
5752,THE PUZZLER,"“You know 'em?” said Penfentenyou, as I made some noise or other."
5753,THE PUZZLER,
5754,THE PUZZLER,“By sight only. The big fellow in flannels is Lord Lundie; the
5755,THE PUZZLER,light-built one with the yellow beard painted his picture at the last
5756,THE PUZZLER,"Academy: He's a swell R.A., James Loman.”"
5757,THE PUZZLER,
5758,THE PUZZLER,“And the brown chap with the hands?”
5759,THE PUZZLER,
5760,THE PUZZLER,"“Tomling, Sir Christopher Tomling, the South American engineer who built"
5761,THE PUZZLER,the--”
5762,THE PUZZLER,
5763,THE PUZZLER,"“San Juan Viaduct. I know,” said Penfentenyou. “We ought to have had him"
5764,THE PUZZLER,with us.... Do you think a monkey would climb the tree?”
5765,THE PUZZLER,
5766,THE PUZZLER,The organ-grinder at the gate fenced his beast with one arm as
5767,THE PUZZLER,Jimmy talked.
5768,THE PUZZLER,
5769,THE PUZZLER,"“Don't show off your futile accomplishments,” said Lord Lundie. “Tell"
5770,THE PUZZLER,him it's an experiment. Interest him!”
5771,THE PUZZLER,
5772,THE PUZZLER,"“Shut up, Bubbles. You aren't in court,” Jimmy replied. “This needs"
5773,THE PUZZLER,delicacy. Giuseppe says--”
5774,THE PUZZLER,
5775,THE PUZZLER,"“Interest the monkey,” the brown engineer interrupted. “He won't climb"
5776,THE PUZZLER,"for love. Cut up to the house and get some biscuits, Bubbles--sugar ones"
5777,THE PUZZLER,and an orange or two. No need to tell our womenfolk.”
5778,THE PUZZLER,
5779,THE PUZZLER,The huge white figure lobbed off at a trot which would not have
5780,THE PUZZLER,disgraced a boy of seventeen. I gathered from something Jimmy let fall
5781,THE PUZZLER,that the three had been at Harrow together.
5782,THE PUZZLER,
5783,THE PUZZLER,"“That Tomling has a head on his Shoulders,” muttered Penfentenyou. “Pity"
5784,THE PUZZLER,"we didn't get him for the Colony. But the question is, will the monkey"
5785,THE PUZZLER,climb?”
5786,THE PUZZLER,
5787,THE PUZZLER,"“Be quick, Jimmy. Tell the man we'll give him five bob for the loan of"
5788,THE PUZZLER,"the beast. Now run the organ under the tree, and we'll dress it when"
5789,THE PUZZLER,"Bubbles comes back,” Sir Christopher cried."
5790,THE PUZZLER,
5791,THE PUZZLER,"“I've often wondered,” said Penfentenyou, “whether it would puzzle"
5792,THE PUZZLER,"a monkey?” He had forgotten the needs of his Growing Nation, and was"
5793,THE PUZZLER,earnestly parting the white-thorn stems with his fingers.
5794,THE PUZZLER,
5795,THE PUZZLER,*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
5796,THE PUZZLER,
5797,THE PUZZLER,"Giuseppe and Jimmy did as they were told, the monkey following them with"
5798,THE PUZZLER,a wary and malignant eye.
5799,THE PUZZLER,
5800,THE PUZZLER,"“Here's a discovery,” said Jimmy. “The singing part of this organ comes"
5801,THE PUZZLER,"off the wheels.” He spoke volubly to the proprietor. “Oh, it's so as"
5802,THE PUZZLER,Giuseppe can take it to his room o' nights. And play it. D'you hear
5803,THE PUZZLER,"that? The organ-grinder, after his day's crime, plays his accursed"
5804,THE PUZZLER,"machine for love. For love, Chris! And Michael Angelo was one of 'em!”"
5805,THE PUZZLER,
5806,THE PUZZLER,"“Don't jaw! Tell him to take the beast's petticoat off,” said Sir"
5807,THE PUZZLER,Christopher Tomling.
5808,THE PUZZLER,
5809,THE PUZZLER,"Lord Lundie returned, very little winded, through a gap higher up the"
5810,THE PUZZLER,hedge.
5811,THE PUZZLER,
5812,THE PUZZLER,"“They're all out, thank goodness!” he cried, “but I've raided what I"
5813,THE PUZZLER,"could. _Marrons glacés_, candied fruit, and a bag of oranges.”"
5814,THE PUZZLER,
5815,THE PUZZLER,“Excellent!” said the world-renowned contractor.
5816,THE PUZZLER,
5817,THE PUZZLER,"“Jimmy, you're the light-weight; jump up on the organ and impale these"
5818,THE PUZZLER,things on the leaves as I hand 'em!”
5819,THE PUZZLER,
5820,THE PUZZLER,"“I see,” said Jimmy, capering like a springbuck. “Upward and onward, eh?"
5821,THE PUZZLER,"First, he'll reach out for--how infernal prickly these leaves are!--this"
5822,THE PUZZLER,biscuit. Next we'll lure him on--(that's about the reach of his
5823,THE PUZZLER,"arm)--with the _marron glacé_, and then he'll open out this orange. How"
5824,THE PUZZLER,"human! How like your ignoble career, Bubbles!”"
5825,THE PUZZLER,
5826,THE PUZZLER,With care and elaboration they ornamented that tree's lower branches
5827,THE PUZZLER,"with sugar-topped biscuits, oranges, bits of banana, and _marrons glacés_"
5828,THE PUZZLER,till it looked a very ape's path to Paradise.
5829,THE PUZZLER,
5830,THE PUZZLER,“Unchain the Gyascutis!” said Sir Christopher commandingly. Giuseppe
5831,THE PUZZLER,"placed the monkey atop of the organ, where the beast, misunderstanding,"
5832,THE PUZZLER,stood on his head.
5833,THE PUZZLER,
5834,THE PUZZLER,"“He's throwing himself on the mercy of the Court, me lud,” said Jimmy."
5835,THE PUZZLER,“No--now he's interested. Now he's reaching after higher things. What
5836,THE PUZZLER,wouldn't I give to have here” (he mentioned a name not unhonoured in
5837,THE PUZZLER,British Art). “Ambition plucking apples of Sodom!” (the monkey had
5838,THE PUZZLER,"pricked himself and was swearing). “Genius hampered by Convention? Oh,"
5839,THE PUZZLER,there's a whole bushelful of allegories in it!”
5840,THE PUZZLER,
5841,THE PUZZLER,"“Give him time. He's balancing the probabilities,” said Lord Lundie."
5842,THE PUZZLER,
5843,THE PUZZLER,"The three closed round the monkey,--hanging on his every motion with"
5844,THE PUZZLER,an earnestness almost equal to ours. The great judge's head--seamed and
5845,THE PUZZLER,"vertical forehead, iron mouth, and pike-like under-jaw, all set on that"
5846,THE PUZZLER,thick neck rising out of the white flannelled collar--was thrown against
5847,THE PUZZLER,the puckered green silk of the organ-front as it might have been a cameo
5848,THE PUZZLER,"of Titus. Jimmy, with raised eyes and parted lips, fingered his grizzled"
5849,THE PUZZLER,"chestnut beard, and I was near enough to note, the capable beauty of his"
5850,THE PUZZLER,"hands. Sir Christopher stood a little apart, his arms folded behind his"
5851,THE PUZZLER,"back, one heavy brown boot thrust forward, chin in as curbed, and black"
5852,THE PUZZLER,eyebrows lowered to shade the keen eyes.
5853,THE PUZZLER,
5854,THE PUZZLER,"Giuseppe's dark face between flashing earrings, a twisted rag of red and"
5855,THE PUZZLER,"yellow silk round his throat, turned from the reaching yearning monkey"
5856,THE PUZZLER,to the pink and white biscuits spiked on the bronzed leafage. And upon
5857,THE PUZZLER,them all fell the serious and workmanlike sun of an English summer
5858,THE PUZZLER,forenoon.
5859,THE PUZZLER,
5860,THE PUZZLER,"“Fils de Saint Louis, montez au ciel!” said Lord Lundie suddenly in a"
5861,THE PUZZLER,voice that made me think of Black Caps. I do not know what the
5862,THE PUZZLER,"monkey thought, because at that instant he leaped off the organ and"
5863,THE PUZZLER,disappeared.
5864,THE PUZZLER,
5865,THE PUZZLER,There was a clash of broken glass behind the tree.
5866,THE PUZZLER,
5867,THE PUZZLER,"The monkey's face, distorted with passion, appeared at an upper window"
5868,THE PUZZLER,"of the house, and a starred hole in the stained-glass window to the left"
5869,THE PUZZLER,of 'the front door showed the first steps of his upward path.
5870,THE PUZZLER,
5871,THE PUZZLER,"“We've got to catch him,” cried Sir Christopher. “Come along!”"
5872,THE PUZZLER,
5873,THE PUZZLER,"They pushed at the door, which was unlocked."
5874,THE PUZZLER,
5875,THE PUZZLER,"“Yes. But consider the ethics of the case,” said Jimmy. “Isn't this"
5876,THE PUZZLER,"burglary or something, Bubbles?”"
5877,THE PUZZLER,
5878,THE PUZZLER,"“Settle that when he's caught,” said Sir Christopher. “We're responsible"
5879,THE PUZZLER,for the beast.”
5880,THE PUZZLER,
5881,THE PUZZLER,"A furious clanging of bells broke out of the empty house, followed by"
5882,THE PUZZLER,muffed gurglings and trumpetings.
5883,THE PUZZLER,
5884,THE PUZZLER,"“What the deuce is that?” I asked, half aloud."
5885,THE PUZZLER,
5886,THE PUZZLER,"“The plumbing, of course,” said Penfentenyou. “What a pity! I believe"
5887,THE PUZZLER,he'd have climbed if Lord Lundie hadn't put him off!”
5888,THE PUZZLER,
5889,THE PUZZLER,"“Wait a moment, Chris,” said Jimmy the interpreter; “Guiseppe says he"
5890,THE PUZZLER,"may answer to the music of his infancy. Giuseppe, therefore, will go"
5891,THE PUZZLER,"in with the organ. Orpheus with his lute, you know. Avante, Orpheus!"
5892,THE PUZZLER,"There's no Neapolitan for bathroom, but I fancy your friend is there.”"
5893,THE PUZZLER,
5894,THE PUZZLER,"“I'm not going into another man's house with a hurdy-gurdy,” said Lord"
5895,THE PUZZLER,"Lundie, recoiling, as Giuseppe unshipped the working mechanism of the"
5896,THE PUZZLER,"organ (it developed a hang-down leg) from its wheels, slipped a strap"
5897,THE PUZZLER,"round his shoulders, and gave the handle a twist."
5898,THE PUZZLER,
5899,THE PUZZLER,"“Don't be a cad, Bubbles,” was Jimmy's answer. “You couldn't leave us"
5900,THE PUZZLER,"now if you were on the Woolsack. Play, Orpheus! The Cadi accompanies.”"
5901,THE PUZZLER,
5902,THE PUZZLER,*    *    *     *   *    *    *    *    *
5903,THE PUZZLER,
5904,THE PUZZLER,
5905,THE PUZZLER,"With a whoop, a buzz, and a crash, the organ sprang to life under"
5906,THE PUZZLER,"the hand of Giuseppe, and the procession passed through the"
5907,THE PUZZLER,grained-to-imitate-walnut front door. A moment later we saw the monkey
5908,THE PUZZLER,ramping on the roof.
5909,THE PUZZLER,
5910,THE PUZZLER,"“He'll be all over the township in a minute if we don't head him,” said"
5911,THE PUZZLER,"Penfentenyou, leaping to his feet, and crashing into the garden. We"
5912,THE PUZZLER,headed him with pebbles till he retired through a window to the tuneful
5913,THE PUZZLER,reminder that he had left a lot of little things behind him. As we
5914,THE PUZZLER,"passed the front door it swung open, and showed Jimmy the artist sitting"
5915,THE PUZZLER,"at the bottom of a newly-cleaned staircase. He waggled his hands at us,"
5916,THE PUZZLER,and when we entered we saw that the man was stricken speechless. His
5917,THE PUZZLER,eyes grew red--red like a ferret's--and what little breath he had
5918,THE PUZZLER,"whistled shrilly. At first we thought it was a fit, and then we saw that"
5919,THE PUZZLER,it was mirth--the inopportune mirth of the Artistic Temperament.
5920,THE PUZZLER,
5921,THE PUZZLER,The house palpitated to an infamous melody punctuated by the stump of
5922,THE PUZZLER,"the barrel-organ's one leg, as Giuseppe, above, moved from room to room"
5923,THE PUZZLER,after his rebel slave. Now and again a floor shook a little under the
5924,THE PUZZLER,"combined rushes of Lord Lundie and Sir Christopher Tomling, who gave"
5925,THE PUZZLER,many and contradictory orders. But when they could they cursed Jimmy
5926,THE PUZZLER,with splendid thoroughness.
5927,THE PUZZLER,
5928,THE PUZZLER,“Have you anything to do with the house?” panted Jimmy at last. “Because
5929,THE PUZZLER,we're using it just now.” He gulped. “And I'm--ah--keeping cavè.”
5930,THE PUZZLER,
5931,THE PUZZLER,"“All right,” said Penfentenyou, and shut the hall door."
5932,THE PUZZLER,
5933,THE PUZZLER,"“Jimmy, you unspeakable blackguard, Jimmy, you cur! You coward!”"
5934,THE PUZZLER,(Lord Lundie's voice overbore the flood of melody.) “Come up here!
5935,THE PUZZLER,Giussieppe's saying something we don't understand.”
5936,THE PUZZLER,
5937,THE PUZZLER,Jimmy listened and interpreted between hiccups.
5938,THE PUZZLER,
5939,THE PUZZLER,"“He says you'd better play the organ, Bubbles, and let him do the"
5940,THE PUZZLER,stalking. The monkey knows him.”
5941,THE PUZZLER,
5942,THE PUZZLER,"“By Jove, he's quite right,” said Sir Christopher from the landing."
5943,THE PUZZLER,"“Take it, Bubbles, at once.”"
5944,THE PUZZLER,
5945,THE PUZZLER,“My God!” said Lord Lundie in horror.
5946,THE PUZZLER,
5947,THE PUZZLER,"The chase reverberated over our heads, from the attics to the first"
5948,THE PUZZLER,"floor and back again. Bodies and Voices met in collision and argument,"
5949,THE PUZZLER,and once or twice the organ hit walls and doors. Then it broke forth in
5950,THE PUZZLER,a new manner.
5951,THE PUZZLER,
5952,THE PUZZLER,"“He's playing it,” said Jimmy. “I know his acute Justinian ear. Are you"
5953,THE PUZZLER,fond of music?”
5954,THE PUZZLER,
5955,THE PUZZLER,"“I think Lord Lundie plays very well for a beginner,” I ventured."
5956,THE PUZZLER,
5957,THE PUZZLER,“Ah! That's the trained legal intellect. Like mastering a brief. I
5958,THE PUZZLER,haven't got it.” He wiped his eyes and shook.
5959,THE PUZZLER,
5960,THE PUZZLER,"“Hi!” said Penfentenyou, looking through the stained glass window down"
5961,THE PUZZLER,the garden. “What's that!”
5962,THE PUZZLER,
5963,THE PUZZLER,*    *    *     *   *    *    *    *    *
5964,THE PUZZLER,
5965,THE PUZZLER,
5966,THE PUZZLER,"A household removals van, in charge of four men, had halted at the"
5967,THE PUZZLER,gate. A husband and his wife householders beyond question--quavered
5968,THE PUZZLER,irresolutely up the path. He looked tired. She was certainly cross.
5969,THE PUZZLER,In all this haphazard world the last couple to understand a scientific
5970,THE PUZZLER,experiment.
5971,THE PUZZLER,
5972,THE PUZZLER,I laid hands on Jimmy--the clamour above drowning speech and with
5973,THE PUZZLER,"Penfentenyou's aid, propped him against the window, that he should see."
5974,THE PUZZLER,
5975,THE PUZZLER,"He saw, nodded, fell as an umbrella can fall, and kneeling, beat his"
5976,THE PUZZLER,forehead on the shut door. Penfentenyou slid the bolt.
5977,THE PUZZLER,
5978,THE PUZZLER,"The furniture men reinforced the two figures on the path, and advanced,"
5979,THE PUZZLER,spreading generously.
5980,THE PUZZLER,
5981,THE PUZZLER,“Hadn't we better warn them up-stairs?” I suggested:
5982,THE PUZZLER,
5983,THE PUZZLER,"“No. I'll die first!” said Jimmy. “I'm pretty near it now. Besides, they"
5984,THE PUZZLER,called me names.”
5985,THE PUZZLER,
5986,THE PUZZLER,I turned from the Artist to the Administrator.
5987,THE PUZZLER,
5988,THE PUZZLER,"“Ceteris paribus, I think we'd better be going,” said Penfentenyou,"
5989,THE PUZZLER,dealer in crises.
5990,THE PUZZLER,
5991,THE PUZZLER,"“Ta--take me with you,” said Jimmy. “I've no reputation to lose, but I'd"
5992,THE PUZZLER,like to watch 'em from--er--outside the picture.”
5993,THE PUZZLER,
5994,THE PUZZLER,"“There's always a modus vivendi,” Penfentenyou murmured, and tiptoed"
5995,THE PUZZLER,"along the hall to a back door, which he opened quite silently. We passed"
5996,THE PUZZLER,"into a tangle of gooseberry bushes where, at his statesmanlike example,"
5997,THE PUZZLER,"we crawled on all fours, and regained the hedge."
5998,THE PUZZLER,
5999,THE PUZZLER,"Here we lay up, secure in our alibi."
6000,THE PUZZLER,
6001,THE PUZZLER,"“But your firm,”--the woman was wailing to the furniture removals"
6002,THE PUZZLER,men--“your firm promised me everything should be in yesterday. And it's
6003,THE PUZZLER,to-day! You should have been here yesterday!”
6004,THE PUZZLER,
6005,THE PUZZLER,"“The last tenants ain't out yet, lydy,” said one of them."
6006,THE PUZZLER,
6007,THE PUZZLER,"Lord Lundie was rapidly improving in technique, though organ-grinding,"
6008,THE PUZZLER,"unlike the Law, is more of a calling than a trade, and he hung"
6009,THE PUZZLER,"occasionally on a dead centre. Giuseppe, I think, was singing, but I"
6010,THE PUZZLER,could not understand the drift of Sir Christopher's remarks. They were
6011,THE PUZZLER,Spanish.
6012,THE PUZZLER,
6013,THE PUZZLER,The woman said something we did not catch.
6014,THE PUZZLER,
6015,THE PUZZLER,"“You might 'ave sub-let it,” the man insisted. “Or your gentleman 'ere"
6016,THE PUZZLER,might.”
6017,THE PUZZLER,
6018,THE PUZZLER,“But I didn't. Send for the Police at once.”
6019,THE PUZZLER,
6020,THE PUZZLER,"“I wouldn't do that, lydy. They're only fruit pickers on a beano. They"
6021,THE PUZZLER,aren't particular where they sleep.”
6022,THE PUZZLER,
6023,THE PUZZLER,“D'you mean they've been sleeping there? I only had it cleaned last
6024,THE PUZZLER,week. Get them out.”
6025,THE PUZZLER,
6026,THE PUZZLER,"“Oh, if you say so, we'll 'ave 'em out of it in two twos. Alf, fetch me"
6027,THE PUZZLER,the spare swingle-bar.”
6028,THE PUZZLER,
6029,THE PUZZLER,“Don't! You'll knock the paint off the door. Get them out!”
6030,THE PUZZLER,
6031,THE PUZZLER,"“What the 'ell else am I trying to do for you, lydy?” the man answered"
6032,THE PUZZLER,with pathos; but the woman wheeled on her mate.
6033,THE PUZZLER,
6034,THE PUZZLER,"“Edward! They're all drunk here, and they're all mad there. Do"
6035,THE PUZZLER,something!” she said.
6036,THE PUZZLER,
6037,THE PUZZLER,"Edward took one short step forward, and sighed “Hullo!” in the direction"
6038,THE PUZZLER,"of the turbulent house. The woman walked up and down, the very figure"
6039,THE PUZZLER,"of Domestic Tragedy. The furniture men swayed a little on their heels,"
6040,THE PUZZLER,and--
6041,THE PUZZLER,
6042,THE PUZZLER,“Got him!” The shout rang through all the windows at once. It was
6043,THE PUZZLER,"followed by a blood-hound-like bay from Sir Christopher, a maniacal"
6044,THE PUZZLER,"prestissimo on the organ, and loud cries, for Jimmy. But Jimmy, at my"
6045,THE PUZZLER,"side, rolled his congested eyeballs, owl-wise."
6046,THE PUZZLER,
6047,THE PUZZLER,"“I never knew them,” he said. “I'm an orphan.”"
6048,THE PUZZLER,
6049,THE PUZZLER,*    *    *     *   *    *    *    *    *
6050,THE PUZZLER,
6051,THE PUZZLER,
6052,THE PUZZLER,"The front door opened, and the three came forth to short-lived triumph."
6053,THE PUZZLER,"I had never before seen a Law Lord dressed as for tennis, with a"
6054,THE PUZZLER,stump-leg barrel-organ strapped to his shoulder. But it is a shy bird
6055,THE PUZZLER,in this plumage. Lord Lundie strove to disembarrass himself of his
6056,THE PUZZLER,accoutrements much as an ill-trained Punch and Judy dog tries to escape
6057,THE PUZZLER,"backwards through his frilled collar. Sir Christopher, covered with"
6058,THE PUZZLER,"limewash, cherished a bleeding thumb, and the almost crazy monkey tore"
6059,THE PUZZLER,at Giuseppe's hair.
6060,THE PUZZLER,
6061,THE PUZZLER,"The men on both sides reeled, but the woman stood her ground. “Idiots!”"
6062,THE PUZZLER,"she said, and once more, “Idiots!”"
6063,THE PUZZLER,
6064,THE PUZZLER,I could have gladdened a few convicts of my acquaintance with a
6065,THE PUZZLER,photograph of Lord Lundie at that instant.
6066,THE PUZZLER,
6067,THE PUZZLER,"“Madam,” he began, wonderfully preserving the roll in his voice, “it was"
6068,THE PUZZLER,a monkey.”
6069,THE PUZZLER,
6070,THE PUZZLER,Sir Christopher sucked his thumb and nodded.
6071,THE PUZZLER,
6072,THE PUZZLER,"“Take it away and go,” she replied. “Go away!”"
6073,THE PUZZLER,
6074,THE PUZZLER,"I would have gone, and gladly, on this permission, but these still"
6075,THE PUZZLER,strong men must ever be justifying themselves. Lord Lundie turned to the
6076,THE PUZZLER,"husband, who for the first time spoke."
6077,THE PUZZLER,
6078,THE PUZZLER,"“I have rented this house. I am moving in,” he said."
6079,THE PUZZLER,
6080,THE PUZZLER,"“We ought to have been in yesterday,” the woman interrupted."
6081,THE PUZZLER,
6082,THE PUZZLER,“Yes. We ought to have been in yesterday. Have you slept there
6083,THE PUZZLER,overnight?” said the man peevishly.
6084,THE PUZZLER,
6085,THE PUZZLER,"“No; I assure you we haven't,” said Lord Lundie."
6086,THE PUZZLER,
6087,THE PUZZLER,"“Then go away. Go quite away,” cried the woman."
6088,THE PUZZLER,
6089,THE PUZZLER,"They went--in single file down the path. They went silently, restrapping"
6090,THE PUZZLER,"the organ on its wheels, and rechaining the monkey to the organ."
6091,THE PUZZLER,
6092,THE PUZZLER,"“Damn it all!” said Penfentenyou. “They do face the music, and they do"
6093,THE PUZZLER,stick by each other in private life!”
6094,THE PUZZLER,
6095,THE PUZZLER,"“Ties of Common Funk,” I answered. Giuseppe ran to the gate and fled"
6096,THE PUZZLER,"back to the possible world. Lord Lundie and Sir Christopher, constrained"
6097,THE PUZZLER,"by tradition, paced slowly."
6098,THE PUZZLER,
6099,THE PUZZLER,"Then it came to pass that the woman, who walked behind them, lifted up"
6100,THE PUZZLER,"her eyes, and beheld the tree which they had dressed."
6101,THE PUZZLER,
6102,THE PUZZLER,“Stop!” she called; and they stopped. “Who did that?”
6103,THE PUZZLER,
6104,THE PUZZLER,There was no answer. The Eternal Bad Boy in every man hung its head
6105,THE PUZZLER,before the Eternal Mother in every woman.
6106,THE PUZZLER,
6107,THE PUZZLER,“Who put these disgusting things there?” she repeated.
6108,THE PUZZLER,
6109,THE PUZZLER,"Suddenly Penfentenyou, Premier of his Colony in all but name, left Jimmy"
6110,THE PUZZLER,"and me, and appeared at the gate. (If he is not turned out of office,"
6111,THE PUZZLER,that is how he will appear on the Day of Armageddon.)
6112,THE PUZZLER,
6113,THE PUZZLER,"“Well done you!” he cried zealously, and doffed his hat to the woman."
6114,THE PUZZLER,"“Have you any children, madam?” he demanded."
6115,THE PUZZLER,
6116,THE PUZZLER,"“Yes, two. They should have been here to-day. The firm promised--”"
6117,THE PUZZLER,
6118,THE PUZZLER,“Then we're not a minute too soon. That monkey escaped. It was a very
6119,THE PUZZLER,dangerous beast. 'Might have frightened your children into fits. All the
6120,THE PUZZLER,organ-grinder's fault! A most lucky thing these gentlemen caught it when
6121,THE PUZZLER,"they did. I hope you aren't badly mauled, Sir Christopher?” Shaken as"
6122,THE PUZZLER,I was (I wanted to get away and laugh) I could not but admire the
6123,THE PUZZLER,scoundrel's consummate tact in leading his second highest trump. An ass
6124,THE PUZZLER,would have introduced Lord Lundie and they would not have believed him.
6125,THE PUZZLER,
6126,THE PUZZLER,"It took the trick. The couple smiled, and gave respectful thanks for"
6127,THE PUZZLER,their deliverance by such hands from such perils.
6128,THE PUZZLER,
6129,THE PUZZLER,"“Not in the least,” said Lord Lundie. “Anybody--any father--would have"
6130,THE PUZZLER,"done as much, and--pray don't apologize--your mistake was quite natural.”"
6131,THE PUZZLER,"A furniture man sniggered here, and Lord Lundie rolled an Eye of Doom on"
6132,THE PUZZLER,"their ranks. “By the way, if you have trouble with these persons--they"
6133,THE PUZZLER,seem to have taken as much as is good for them--please let me know.
6134,THE PUZZLER,Er--Good morning!”
6135,THE PUZZLER,
6136,THE PUZZLER,They turned into the lane.
6137,THE PUZZLER,
6138,THE PUZZLER,"“Heavens!” said Jimmy, brushing himself down. “Who's that real man"
6139,THE PUZZLER,"with the real head?” and we hurried after them, for they were running"
6140,THE PUZZLER,"unsteadily, squeaking like rabbits as they ran. We overtook them in a"
6141,THE PUZZLER,"little nut wood half a mile up the road, where they had turned aside,"
6142,THE PUZZLER,"and were rolling. So we rolled with them, and ceased not till we had"
6143,THE PUZZLER,arrived at the extremity of exhaustion.
6144,THE PUZZLER,
6145,THE PUZZLER,"“You--you saw it all, then?” said Lord Lundie, rebuttoning his"
6146,THE PUZZLER,nineteen-inch collar.
6147,THE PUZZLER,
6148,THE PUZZLER,"“I saw it was a vital question from the first,” responded Penfentenyou,"
6149,THE PUZZLER,and blew his nose.
6150,THE PUZZLER,
6151,THE PUZZLER,"“It was. By the way, d'you mind telling me your name?”"
6152,THE PUZZLER,
6153,THE PUZZLER,
6154,THE PUZZLER,"Summa. Penfentenyou's Great Idea has gone through, a little chipped"
6155,THE PUZZLER,"at the edges, but in fine and far-reaching shape. His Opposite Number"
6156,THE PUZZLER,"worked at it like a mule--a bewildered mule, beaten from behind, coaxed"
6157,THE PUZZLER,"from in front, and propped on either soft side by Lord Lundie of the"
6158,THE PUZZLER,compressed mouth and the searing tongue.
6159,THE PUZZLER,
6160,THE PUZZLER,"Sir Christopher Tomling has been ravished from the Argentine, where,"
6161,THE PUZZLER,"after all, he was but preparing trade-routes for hostile peoples, and"
6162,THE PUZZLER,now adorns the forefront of Penfentenyou's Advisory Board. This was an
6163,THE PUZZLER,"unforeseen extra, as was Jimmy's gratis full-length--(it will be in this"
6164,THE PUZZLER,"year's Academy) of Penfentenyou, who has returned to his own place."
6165,THE PUZZLER,
6166,THE PUZZLER,"Now and again, from afar off, between the slam and bump of his shifting"
6167,THE PUZZLER,"scenery, the glare of his manipulated limelight, and the controlled"
6168,THE PUZZLER,"rolling of his thunder-drums, I catch his voice, lifted in encouragement"
6169,THE PUZZLER,and advice to his fellow-countrymen. He is quite sound on Ties of
6170,THE PUZZLER,"Sentiment, and--alone of Colonial Statesmen ventures to talk of the Ties"
6171,THE PUZZLER,of Common Funk.
6172,THE PUZZLER,

6184,THE PUZZLER,
6185,THE PUZZLER,"Their psychology is bovine, their outlook crude and rare;"
6186,THE PUZZLER,They abandon vital matters to be tickled with a straw;
6187,THE PUZZLER,But the straw that they were tickled with--the chaff that
6188,THE PUZZLER,they were fed with--
6189,THE PUZZLER,They convert into a weaver's beam to break their foeman's head
6190,THE PUZZLER,with.
6191,THE PUZZLER,
6192,THE PUZZLER,"For undemocratic reasons and for motives not of State,"
6193,THE PUZZLER,They arrive at their conclusions--largely inarticulate.
6194,THE PUZZLER,Being void of self-expression they confide their views to none;

6198,THE PUZZLER,"In telegraphic sentences, half swallowed at the ends,"
6199,THE PUZZLER,They hint a matter's inwardness--and there the matter ends.

6210,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"A fox came out of his earth on the banks of the Great River Gihon,"
6211,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,which waters Ethiopia. He saw a white man riding through the dry
6212,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"dhurra-stalks, and, that his destiny might be fulfilled, barked at him."
6213,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6214,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The rider drew rein among the villagers round his stirrup.
6215,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6216,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“What,” said he, “is that?”"
6217,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6218,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“That,” said the Sheikh of the village, “is a fox, O Excellency Our"
6219,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Governor.”
6220,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6221,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“It is not, then, a jackal?”"
6222,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,

6224,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6225,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Also,” the white man spoke half aloud, “I am Mudir of this Province.”"
6226,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6227,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“It is true,” they cried. “Ya, Saart el Mudir” (O Excellency Our"
6228,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Governor).
6229,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6230,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"The Great River Gihon, well used to the moods of kings, slid between his"
6231,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"mile-wide banks toward the sea, while the Governor praised God in a loud"
6232,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,and searching cry never before heard by the river.
6233,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6234,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"When he had lowered his right forefinger from behind his right ear, the"
6235,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"villagers talked to him of their crops--barley, dhurrah, millet, onions,"
6236,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,and the like. The Governor stood in his stirrups. North he looked up
6237,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,a strip of green cultivation a few hundred yards wide that lay like a
6238,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,carpet between the river and the tawny line of the desert. Sixty miles
6239,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"that strip stretched before him, and as many behind. At every half-mile"
6240,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,a groaning water-wheel lifted the soft water from the river to the crops
6241,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,by way of a mud-built aqueduct. A foot or so wide was the water-channel;
6242,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"five foot or more high was the bank on which it ran, and its base was"
6243,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"broad in proportion. Abu Hussein, misnamed the Father of Cunning, drank"
6244,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"from the river below his earth, and his shadow was long in the low sun."
6245,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,He could not understand the loud cry which the Governor had cried.
6246,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6247,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The Sheikh of the village spoke of the crops from which the rulers of
6248,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"all lands draw revenue; but the Governor's eyes were fixed, between his"
6249,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"horse's ears, on the nearest water-channel."
6250,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6251,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Very like a ditch in Ireland,” he murmured, and smiled, dreaming of a"
6252,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,razor-topped bank in distant Kildare.
6253,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6254,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Encouraged by that smile, the Sheikh continued. “When crops fail it is"
6255,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"necessary to remit taxation. Then it is a good thing, O Excellency"
6256,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Our Governor, that you come and see the crops which have failed, and"
6257,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,discover that we have not lied.”
6258,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6259,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Assuredly.” The Governor shortened his reins. The horse cantered on,"
6260,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"rose at the embankment of the water-channel, changed leg cleverly on"
6261,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"top, and hopped down in a cloud of golden dust."
6262,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6263,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Abu Hussein from his earth watched with interest. He had never before
6264,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,seen such things.
6265,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6266,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Assuredly,” the Governor repeated, and came back by the way he had"
6267,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,gone. “It is always best to see for one's self.”
6268,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6269,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"An ancient and still bullet-speckled stern-wheel steamer, with a barge"
6270,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"lashed to her side, came round the river bend. She whistled to tell the"
6271,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Governor his dinner was ready, and the horse, seeing his fodder piled on"
6272,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the barge, whinnied back."
6273,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6274,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Moreover,” the Sheikh added, “in the days of the Oppression the Emirs"
6275,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,and their creatures dispossessed many people of their lands. All up and
6276,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,down the river our people are waiting to return to their lawful fields.”
6277,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6278,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Judges have been appointed to settle that matter,” said the Governor."
6279,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“They will presently come in steamers and hear the witnesses.”
6280,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6281,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Wherefore? Did the Judges kill the Emirs? We would rather be judged by
6282,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,the men who executed God's judgment on the Emirs. We would rather abide
6283,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"by your decision, O Excellency Our Governor.”"
6284,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6285,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The Governor nodded. It was a year since he had seen the Emirs stretched
6286,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"close and still round the reddened sheepskin where lay El Mahdi, the"
6287,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Prophet of God. Now there remained no trace of their dominion except the
6288,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"old steamer, once part of a Dervish flotilla, which was his house and"
6289,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"office. She sidled into the shore, lowered a plank, and the Governor"
6290,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,followed his horse aboard.
6291,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6292,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Lights burned on her till late, dully reflected in the river that tugged"
6293,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"at her mooring-ropes. The Governor read, not for the first time, the"
6294,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"administration reports of one John Jorrocks, M.F.H."
6295,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6296,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“We shall need,” he said suddenly to his Inspector, “about ten couple."
6297,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"I'll get 'em when I go home. You'll be Whip, Baker?”"
6298,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6299,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"The Inspector, who was not yet twenty-five, signified his assent in the"
6300,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"usual manner, while Abu Hussein barked at the vast desert moon."
6301,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6302,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Ha!” said the Governor, coming out in his pyjamas, “we'll be giving you"
6303,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"capivi in another three months, my friend.”"
6304,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6305,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,*      *      *      *      *
6306,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6307,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"It was four, as a matter of fact, ere a steamer with a melodious"
6308,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,bargeful of hounds anchored at that landing. The Inspector leaped down
6309,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"among them, and the homesick wanderers received him as a brother."
6310,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6311,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Everybody fed 'em everything on board ship, but they're real dainty"
6312,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"hounds at bottom,” the Governor explained. “That's Royal you've got hold"
6313,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,of--the pick of the bunch--and the bitch that's got hold of you--she's
6314,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"a little excited--is May Queen. Merriman, out of Cottesmore Maudlin, you"
6315,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,know.”
6316,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6317,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“I know. 'Grand old betch with the tan eyebrows,'” the Inspector cooed."
6318,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Oh, Ben! I shall take an interest in life now. Hark to 'em! O hark!”"
6319,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6320,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Abu Hussein, under the high bank, went about his night's work. An eddy"
6321,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"carried his scent to the barge, and three villages heard the crash of"
6322,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,music that followed. Even then Abu Hussein did not know better than to
6323,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,bark in reply.
6324,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6325,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Well, what about my Province?” the Governor asked."
6326,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6327,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Not so bad,” the Inspector answered, with Royal's head between his"
6328,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"knees. “Of course, all the villages want remission of taxes, but, as far"
6329,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"as I can see, the whole country's stinkin' with foxes. Our trouble will"
6330,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,be choppin' 'em in cover. I've got a list of the only villages entitled
6331,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"to any remission. What d'you call this flat-sided, blue-mottled beast"
6332,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,with the jowl?”
6333,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6334,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Beagle-boy. I have my doubts about him. Do you think we can get two
6335,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,days a week?”
6336,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6337,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Easy; and as many byes as you please. The Sheikh of this village here
6338,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"tells me that his barley has failed, and he wants a fifty per cent"
6339,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,remission.”
6340,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6341,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“We'll begin with him to-morrow, and look at his crops as we go. Nothing"
6342,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"like personal supervision,” said the Governor."
6343,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6344,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"They began at sunrise. The pack flew off the barge in every direction,"
6345,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"and, after gambols, dug like terriers at Abu Hussein's many earths. Then"
6346,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,they drank themselves pot-bellied on Gihon water while the Governor and
6347,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,the Inspector chastised them with whips. Scorpions were added; for May
6348,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Queen nosed one, and was removed to the barge lamenting. Mystery (a"
6349,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"puppy, alas!) met a snake, and the blue-mottled Beagle-boy (never a"
6350,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"dainty hound) ate that which he should have passed by. Only Royal, of"
6351,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the Belvoir tan head and the sad, discerning eyes, made any attempt to"
6352,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,uphold the honour of England before the watching village.
6353,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6354,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“You can't expect everything,” said the Governor after breakfast."
6355,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6356,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“We got it, though--everything except foxes. Have you seen May Queen's"
6357,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,nose?” said the Inspector.
6358,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6359,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“And Mystery's dead. We'll keep 'em coupled next time till we get well
6360,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"in among the crops. I say, what a babbling body-snatcher that Beagle-boy"
6361,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,is! Ought to be drowned!”
6362,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6363,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“They bury people so damn casual hereabouts. Give him another chance,”"
6364,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the Inspector pleaded, not knowing that he should live to repent most"
6365,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,bitterly.
6366,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6367,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Talkin' of chances,” said the Governor, “this Sheikh lies about his"
6368,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,barley bein' a failure. If it's high enough to hide a hound at this time
6369,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"of year, it's all right. And he wants a fifty per cent remission, you"
6370,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,said?”
6371,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6372,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“You didn't go on past the melon patch where I tried to turn Wanderer.
6373,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,It's all burned up from there on to the desert. His other water-wheel
6374,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"has broken down, too,” the Inspector replied."
6375,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6376,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Very good. We'll split the difference and allow him twenty-five per
6377,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,cent off. Where'll we meet to-morrow?”
6378,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6379,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“There's some trouble among the villages down the river about their
6380,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"land-titles. It's good goin' ground there, too,” the Inspector said."
6381,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6382,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"The next meet, then, was some twenty miles down the river, and the pack"
6383,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,were not enlarged till they were fairly among the fields. Abu Hussein
6384,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,was there in force--four of him. Four delirious hunts of four minutes
6385,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,each--four hounds per fox--ended in four earths just above the river.
6386,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,All the village looked on.
6387,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6388,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“We forgot about the earths. The banks are riddled with 'em. This'll
6389,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"defeat us,” said the Inspector."
6390,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6391,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Wait a moment!” The Governor drew forth a sneezing hound. “I've just
6392,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,remembered I'm Governor of these parts.”
6393,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6394,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Then turn out a black battalion to stop for us. We'll need 'em, old"
6395,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,man.”
6396,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6397,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"The Governor straightened his back. “Give ear, O people!” he cried. “I"
6398,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,make a new Law!”
6399,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6400,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The villagers closed in. He called:--
6401,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6402,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Henceforward I will give one dollar to the man on whose land Abu
6403,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Hussein is found. And another dollar”--he held up the coin--“to the man
6404,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,on whose land these dogs shall kill him. But to the man on whose land
6405,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Abu Hussein shall run into a hole such as is this hole, I will give not"
6406,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"dollars, but a most unmeasurable beating. Is it understood?”"
6407,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6408,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Our Excellency,” a man stepped forth, “on my land Abu Hussein was found"
6409,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"this morning. Is it not so, brothers?”"
6410,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6411,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,None denied. The Governor tossed him over four dollars without a word.
6412,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6413,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“On my land they all went into their holes,” cried another. “Therefore I"
6414,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,must be beaten.”
6415,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6416,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Not so. The land is mine, and mine are the beatings.”"
6417,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6418,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"This second speaker thrust forward his shoulders already bared, and the"
6419,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,villagers shouted.
6420,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6421,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Hullo! Two men anxious to be licked? There must be some swindle about
6422,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the land,” said the Governor. Then in the local vernacular: “What are"
6423,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,your rights to the beating?”
6424,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6425,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"As a river-reach changes beneath a slant of the sun, that which had been"
6426,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,a scattered mob changed to a court of most ancient justice. The hounds
6427,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"tore and sobbed at Abu Hussein's hearthstone, all unnoticed among"
6428,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the legs of the witnesses, and Gihon, also accustomed to laws, purred"
6429,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,approval.
6430,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6431,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“You will not wait till the Judges come up the river to settle the
6432,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,dispute?” said the Governor at last.
6433,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6434,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“No!” shouted all the village save the man who had first asked to be
6435,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,beaten. “We will abide by Our Excellency's decision. Let Our Excellency
6436,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,turn out the creatures of the Emirs who stole our land in the days of
6437,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,the Oppression.”
6438,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6439,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“And thou sayest?” the Governor turned to the man who had first asked to
6440,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,be beaten.
6441,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6442,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“I say _I_ will wait till the wise Judges come down in the steamer.
6443,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Then I will bring my many witnesses,” he replied."
6444,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6445,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“He is rich. He will bring many witnesses,” the village Sheikh muttered."
6446,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6447,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“No need. Thy own mouth condemns thee!” the Governor cried. “No man
6448,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,lawfully entitled to his land would wait one hour before entering upon
6449,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"it. Stand aside!” The man, fell back, and the village jeered him."
6450,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6451,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The second claimant stooped quickly beneath the lifted hunting-crop. The
6452,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,village rejoiced.
6453,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6454,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Oh, Such an one; Son of such an one,” said the Governor, prompted by"
6455,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the Sheikh, “learn, from the day when I send the order, to block up all"

6457,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6458,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The light flicks ended. The man stood up triumphant. By that accolade
6459,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,had the Supreme Government acknowledged his title before all men.
6460,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6461,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"While the village praised the perspicacity of the Governor, a naked,"
6462,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"pock-marked child strode forward to the earth, and stood on one leg,"
6463,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,unconcerned as a young stork.
6464,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6465,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Hal” he said, hands behind his back. “This should be blocked up with"

6467,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6468,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Better thorns,” said the Governor. “Thick ends innermost.”"
6469,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6470,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The child nodded gravely and squatted on the sand.
6471,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6472,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“An evil day for thee, Abu Hussein,” he shrilled into the mouth of the"

6474,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6475,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Who is it?” the Governor asked the Sheikh. “It thinks.”
6476,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6477,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Farag the Fatherless. His people were slain in the days of the
6478,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Oppression. The man to whom Our Excellency has awarded the land is, as"

6480,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6481,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Will it come with me and feed the big dogs?” said the Governor.
6482,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6483,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The other peering children drew back. “Run!” they cried. “Our Excellency
6484,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,will feed Farag to the big dogs.”
6485,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6486,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“I will come,” said Farag. “And I will never go.” He threw his arm round"
6487,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Royal's neck, and the wise beast licked his face."
6488,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6489,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Binjamin, by Jove!” the Inspector cried."
6490,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6491,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“No!” said the Governor. “I believe he has the makings of a James Pigg!”
6492,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6493,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Farag waved his hand to his uncle, and led Royal on to the barge. The"

6497,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6498,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Gihon, that had seen many sports, learned to know the Hunt barge well."
6499,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,He met her rounding his bends on grey December dawns to music wild and
6500,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"lamentable as the almost forgotten throb of Dervish drums, when, high"
6501,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"above Royal's tenor bell, sharper even than lying Beagle-boy's falsetto"
6502,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"break, Farag chanted deathless war against Abu Hussein and all his seed."
6503,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"At sunrise the river would shoulder her carefully into her place, and"
6504,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"listen to the rush and scutter of the pack fleeing up the gang-plank,"
6505,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,and the tramp of the Governor's Arab behind them. They would pass over
6506,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the brow into the dewless crops where Gihon, low and shrunken, could"
6507,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,only guess what they were about when Abu Hussein flew down the bank
6508,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"to scratch at a stopped earth, and flew back into the barley again. As"
6509,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Farag had foretold, it was evil days for Abu Hussein ere he learned to"
6510,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,take the necessary steps and to get away crisply. Sometimes Gihon saw
6511,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the whole procession of the Hunt silhouetted against the morning-blue,"
6512,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,bearing him company for many merry miles. At every half mile the horses
6513,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"and the donkeys jumped the water-channels--up, on, change your leg, and"
6514,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"off again like figures in a zoetrope, till they grew small along the"
6515,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,line of waterwheels. Then Gibon waited their rustling return through
6516,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the crops, and took them to rest on his bosom at ten o'clock. While the"
6517,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"horses ate, and Farag slept with his head on Royal's flank, the Governor"
6518,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,and his Inspector worked for the good of the Hunt and his Province.
6519,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6520,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,After a little time there was no need to beat any man for neglecting
6521,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,his earths. The steamer's destination was telegraphed from waterwheel
6522,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"to waterwheel, and the villagers stopped out and put to according. If an"
6523,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"earth were overlooked, it meant some dispute as to the ownership of the"
6524,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"land, and then and there the Hunt checked and settled it in this wise:"
6525,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"The Governor and the Inspector side by side, but the latter half a"

6527,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"front; the villagers half-mooned behind them, and Farag with the pack,"
6528,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"who quite understood the performance, sitting down on the left. Twenty"
6529,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"minutes were enough to settle the most complicated case, for, as the"
6530,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Governor said to a judge on the steamer, “One gets at the truth in a"
6531,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,hunting-field a heap quicker than in your lawcourts.”
6532,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6533,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“But when the evidence is conflicting?” the Judge suggested.
6534,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6535,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Watch the field. They'll throw tongue fast enough if you're running a

6537,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6538,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The Sheikhs on horseback--the lesser folk on clever donkeys--the
6539,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,children so despised by Farag soon understood that villages which
6540,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,repaired their waterwheels and channels stood highest in the Governor's
6541,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,favour. He bought their barley for his horses.
6542,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6543,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Channels,” he said, “are necessary that we may all jump them. They are"
6544,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"necessary, moreover, for the crops. Let there be many wheels and sound"

6546,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6547,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Without money,” replied an aged Sheikh, “there are no waterwheels.”"

6556,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,

6586,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Understood. We will build the wheel. I and my seed are responsible for

6665,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“With the kourbash--on the feet. A kourbash is a strip of old hippo-hide
6666,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"with a sort of keel on it, like the cutting edge of a boar's tusk. But"
6667,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,we use the rounded side for a first offender.”
6668,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6669,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“And do any consequences follow this sort of thing? For the victim, I"
6670,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,mean--not for you?”
6671,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6672,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Ve-ry rarely. Let me be fair. I've never seen a man die under the lash,"
6673,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,but gangrene may set up if the kourbash has been pickled.”
6674,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6675,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Pickled in what?” All the table was still and interested.
6676,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6677,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“In copperas, of course. Didn't you know that” said the Inspector."
6678,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6679,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Thank God I didn't.” The large man sputtered visibly.
6680,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6681,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The Inspector wiped his face and grew bolder.
6682,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6683,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“You mustn't think we're careless about our earthstoppers. We've a Hunt
6684,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,fund for hot tar. Tar's a splendid dressing if the toe-nails aren't
6685,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"beaten off. But huntin' as large a country as we do, we mayn't be back"
6686,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"at that village for a month, and if the dressings ain't renewed, and"
6687,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"gangrene sets in, often as not you find your man pegging about on his"
6688,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,stumps. We've a well-known local name for 'em down the river. We call
6689,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"'em the Mudir's Cranes. You see, I persuaded the Governor only to"
6690,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,bastinado on one foot.”
6691,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6692,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“On one foot? The Mudir's Cranes!” The large man turned purple to the
6693,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,top of his bald head. “Would you mind giving me the local word for
6694,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Mudir's Cranes?”
6695,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6696,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,From a too well-stocked memory the Inspector drew one short adhesive
6697,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,word which surprises by itself even unblushing Ethiopia. He spelt it
6698,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"out, saw the large man write it down on his cuff and withdraw. Then the"
6699,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Inspector translated a few of its significations and implications to the
6700,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,four Masters of Foxhounds. He left three days later with eight couple of
6701,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,the best hounds in England--a free and a friendly and an ample gift from
6702,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,four packs to the Gihon Hunt. He had honestly meant to undeceive the
6703,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"large blue mottled man, but somehow forgot about it."
6704,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6705,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The new draft marks a new chapter in the Hunt's history. From an
6706,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,isolated phenomenon in a barge it became a permanent institution with
6707,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"brick-built kennels ashore, and an influence social, political, and"
6708,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"administrative, co-terminous with the boundaries of the province. Ben,"
6709,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the Governor, departed to England, where he kept a pack of real dainty"
6710,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"hounds, but never ceased to long for the old lawless lot. His successors"
6711,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"were ex-officio Masters of the Gihon Hunt, as all Inspectors were Whips."
6712,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"For one reason, Farag, the kennel huntsman, in khaki and puttees, would"
6713,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"obey nothing under the rank of an Excellency, and the hounds would obey"
6714,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"no one but Farag; for another, the best way of estimating crop returns"
6715,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"and revenue was by riding straight to hounds; for a third, though"
6716,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Judges down the river issued signed and sealed land-titles to all lawful
6717,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"owners, yet public opinion along the river never held any such title"
6718,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"valid till it had been confirmed, according to precedent, by the"
6719,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Governor's hunting crop in the hunting field, above the wilfully"
6720,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"neglected earth. True, the ceremony had been cut down to three mere"
6721,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"taps on the shoulder, but Governors who tried to evade that much found"
6722,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,themselves and their office compassed about with a great cloud of
6723,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"witnesses who took up their time with lawsuits and, worse still,"
6724,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"neglected the puppies. The older sheikhs, indeed, stood out for the"
6725,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"unmeasurable beatings of the old days--the sharper the punishment, they"
6726,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"argued, the surer the title; but here the hand of modern progress was"
6727,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"against them, and they contented themselves with telling tales of Ben"
6728,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the first Governor, whom they called the Father of Waterwheels, and of"
6729,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"that heroic age when men, horses, and hounds were worth following."
6730,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6731,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,This same Modern Progress which brought dog biscuit and brass water-taps
6732,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"to the kennels was at work all over the world. Forces, Activities, and"
6733,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Movements sprang into being, agitated themselves, coalesced, and, in"
6734,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"one political avalanche, overwhelmed a bewildered, and not in the least"
6735,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"intending it, England. The echoes of the New Era were borne into the"
6736,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Province on the wings of inexplicable cables. The Gihon Hunt read
6737,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"speeches and sentiments, and policies which amazed them, and they"
6738,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"thanked God, prematurely, that their Province was too far off, too hot,"
6739,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,and too hard worked to be reached by those speakers or their policies.
6740,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"But they, with others, under-estimated the scope and purpose of the New"
6741,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Era.
6742,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6743,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"One by one, the Provinces of the Empire were hauled up and baited, hit"
6744,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"and held, lashed under the belly, and forced back on their haunches for"
6745,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,the amusement of their new masters in the parish of Westminster. One by
6746,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"one they fell away, sore and angry, to compare stripes with each other"
6747,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"at the ends of the uneasy earth. Even so the Gihon Hunt, like Abu"
6748,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Hussein in the old days, did not understand. Then it reached"
6749,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,them through the Press that they habitually flogged to death good
6750,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,revenue-paying cultivators who neglected to stop earths; but that
6751,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the few, the very few who did not die under hippohide whips soaked in"
6752,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"copperas, walked about on their gangrenous ankle-bones, and were known"
6753,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,in derision as the Mudir's Cranes. The charges were vouched for in
6754,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the House of Commons by a Mr. Lethabie Groombride, who had formed a"
6755,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Committee, and was disseminating literature. The Province groaned; the"
6756,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Inspector--now an Inspector of Inspectors--whistled. He had forgotten
6757,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,the gentleman who sputtered in people's faces.
6758,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6759,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“He shouldn't have looked so like Beagle-boy!” was his sole defence when
6760,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,he met the Governor at breakfast on the steamer after a meet.
6761,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6762,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“You shouldn't have joked with an animal of that class,” said Peter the"
6763,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Governor. “Look what Farag has brought me!”
6764,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6765,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"It was a pamphlet, signed on behalf of a Committee by a lady secretary,"
6766,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,but composed by some person who thoroughly understood the language of
6767,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"the Province. After telling the tale of the beatings, it recommended"
6768,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"all the beaten to institute criminal proceedings against their Governor,"
6769,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"and, as soon as might be, to rise against English oppression and"
6770,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,tyranny. Such documents were new in Ethiopia in those days.
6771,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6772,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"The Inspector read the last half page. “But--but,” he stammered, “this"
6773,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,is impossible. White men don't write this sort of stuff.”
6774,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6775,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Don't they, just?” said the Governor. “They get made Cabinet Ministers"
6776,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,for doing it too. I went home last year. I know.”
6777,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6778,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“It'll blow over,” said the Inspector weakly."
6779,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6780,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Not it. Groombride is coming down here to investigate the matter in a
6781,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,few days.”
6782,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6783,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“For himself?”
6784,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6785,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“The Imperial Government's behind him. Perhaps you'd like to look at my
6786,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,orders.” The Governor laid down an uncoded cable. The whiplash to it
6787,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"ran: “You will afford Mr. Groombride every facility for his inquiry,"
6788,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,and will be held responsible that no obstacles are put in his way to
6789,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,the fullest possible examination of any witnesses which he may consider
6790,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"necessary. He will be accompanied by his own interpreter, who must not"
6791,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,be tampered with.”
6792,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6793,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“That's to me--Governor of the Province!” said Peter the Governor.
6794,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6795,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“It seems about enough,” the Inspector answered."
6796,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6797,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Farag, kennel-huntsman, entered the saloon, as was his privilege."
6798,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6799,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“My uncle, who was beaten by the Father of Waterwheels, would approach,"
6800,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"O Excellency,” he said, “and there are others on the bank.”"
6801,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6802,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Admit,” said the Governor."
6803,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6804,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,There tramped aboard sheikhs and villagers to the number of seventeen.
6805,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,In each man's hand was a copy of the pamphlet; in each man's eye terror
6806,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,and uneasiness of the sort that Governors spend and are spent to clear
6807,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"away. Farag's uncle, now Sheikh of the village, spoke: “It is written in"
6808,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"this book, Excellency, that the beatings whereby we hold our lands are"
6809,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,all valueless. It is written that every man who received such a beating
6810,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"from the Father of Waterwheels who slow the Emirs, should instantly"
6811,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"begin a lawsuit, because the title to his land is not valid.”"
6812,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6813,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“It is so written. We do not wish lawsuits. We wish to hold the land as
6814,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"it was given to us after the days of the Oppression,” they cried."
6815,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6816,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The Governor glanced at the Inspector. This was serious. To cast doubt
6817,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"on the ownership of land means, in Ethiopia, the letting in of waters,"
6818,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,and the getting out of troops.
6819,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6820,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Your titles are good,” said the Governor. The Inspector confirmed with"
6821,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,a nod.
6822,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6823,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Then what is the meaning of these writings which came from down the
6824,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,river where the Judges are?” Farag's uncle waved his copy. “By whose
6825,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"order are we ordered to slay you, O Excellency Our Governor?”"
6826,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6827,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“It is not written that you are to slay me.”
6828,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6829,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Not in those very words, but if we leave an earth unstopped, it is"
6830,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,the same as though we wished to save Abu Hussein from the hounds. These
6831,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,writings say: 'Abolish your rulers.' How can we abolish except we kill?
6832,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,We hear rumours of one who comes from down the river soon to lead us to
6833,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,kill.”
6834,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6835,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Fools!” said the Governor. “Your titles are good. This is madness!”
6836,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6837,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“It is so written,” they answered like a pack."
6838,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6839,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Listen,” said the Inspector smoothly. “I know who caused the writings"
6840,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"to be written and sent. He is a man of a blue-mottled jowl, in aspect"
6841,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,like Bigglebai who ate unclean matters. He will come up the river and
6842,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,will give tongue about the beatings.”
6843,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6844,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Will he impeach our land-titles? An evil day for him!”
6845,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6846,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Go slow, Baker,” the Governor whispered. “They'll kill him if they get"
6847,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,scared about their land.”
6848,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6849,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“I tell a parable.” The Inspector lit a cigarette. “Declare which of you
6850,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,took to walk the children of Milkmaid?”
6851,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6852,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Melik-meid First or Second?” said Farag quickly.
6853,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6854,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“The second--the one which was lamed by the thorn.”
6855,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6856,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“No--no. Melik-meid the Second strained her shoulder leaping my
6857,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"water-channel,” a sheikh cried. “Melik-meid the First was lamed by the"
6858,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,thorns on the day when Our Excellency fell thrice.”
6859,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6860,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“True--true. The second Melik-meid's mate was Malvolio, the pied hound,”"
6861,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,said the Inspector.
6862,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6863,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“I had two of the second Melik-meid's pups,” said Farag's uncle. “They"
6864,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,died of the madness in their ninth month.”
6865,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6866,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“And how did they do before they died?” said the Inspector.
6867,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6868,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“They ran about in the sun, and slavered at the mouth till they died.”"
6869,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6870,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Wherefore?”
6871,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6872,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“God knows. He sent the madness. It was no fault of mine.”
6873,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6874,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Thy own mouth hath answered thee.” The Inspector laughed. “It is with
6875,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,men as it is with dogs. God afflicts some with a madness. It is no fault
6876,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,of ours if such men run about in the sun and froth at the mouth. The
6877,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"man who is coming will emit spray from his mouth in speaking, and will"
6878,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,always edge and push in towards his hearers. When ye see and hear him ye
6879,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,will understand that he is afflicted of God: being mad. He is in God's
6880,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,hands.”
6881,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6882,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“But our titles--are our titles to our lands good?” the crowd repeated.
6883,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6884,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Your titles are in my hands--they are good,” said the Governor."
6885,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6886,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“And he who wrote the writings is an afflicted of God?” said Farag's
6887,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,uncle.
6888,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6889,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“The Inspector hath said it,” cried the Governor. “Ye will see when the"
6890,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"man comes. O sheikhs and men, have we ridden together and walked puppies"
6891,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"together, and bought and sold barley for the horses that after these"
6892,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,years we should run riot on the scent of a madman--an afflicted of God?”
6893,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6894,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“But the Hunt pays us to kill mad jackals,” said Farag's uncle. “And he"

6896,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6897,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Aahh! 'Ware riot!” The Governor's hunting-crop cracked like a
6898,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"three-pounder. “By Allah,” he thundered, “if the afflicted of God come"
6899,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"to any harm at your hands, I myself will shoot every hound and every"
6900,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"puppy, and the Hunt shall ride no more. On your heads be it. Go in"

6902,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6903,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“The Hunt shall ride no more,” said Farag's uncle. “Then how can the"

6905,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,a hair on the head of the afflicted of God. He shall be to us as is Abu

6907,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6908,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,When they were gone the Governor mopped his forehead.
6909,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6910,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“We must put a few soldiers in every village this Groombride visits,"
6911,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Baker. Tell 'em to keep out of sight, and have an eye on the villagers."
6912,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,He's trying 'em rather high.”
6913,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6914,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“O Excellency,” said the smooth voice of Farag, laying the Field and"

6925,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,

6935,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6936,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Won't you find it rather hot?” said the Governor. “They generally take

6938,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6939,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Mr. Groombride's large, loose lips set. “That,” he replied pointedly,"
6940,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“would be enough to decide me. I fear you have not quite mastered your

6942,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,not been tampered with by your subordinates.”
6943,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6944,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"He was a yellowish boy called Abdul, who had well eaten and drunk with"
6945,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Farag. The Inspector, by the way, was not present at the meal."
6946,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6947,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“At whatever risk, I shall go unattended,” said Mr. Groombride. “Your"
6948,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"presence would cow them--from giving evidence. Abdul, my good friend,"
6949,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,would you very kindly open the umbrella?”
6950,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6951,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"He passed up the gang-plank to the village, and with no more prelude"
6952,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"than a Salvation Army picket in a Portsmouth slum, cried: “Oh, my"
6953,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,brothers!”
6954,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6955,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,He did not guess how his path had been prepared. The village was
6956,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"widely awake. Farag, in loose, flowing garments, quite unlike a kennel"
6957,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"huntsman's khaki and puttees, leaned against the wall of his uncle's"
6958,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"house. “Come and see the afflicted of God,” he cried musically, “whose"
6959,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"face, indeed, resembles that of Bigglebai.”"
6960,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6961,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"The village came, and decided that on the whole Farag was right."
6962,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6963,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“I can't quite catch what they are saying,” said Mr. Groombride."
6964,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6965,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“They saying they very much pleased to see you, Sar,” Adbul interpreted."
6966,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6967,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Then I do think they might have sent a deputation to the steamer; but
6968,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,I suppose they were frightened of the officials. Tell them not to be
6969,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"frightened, Abdul.”"
6970,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6971,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“He says you are not to be frightened,” Abdul explained. A child"
6972,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"here sputtered with laughter. “Refrain from mirth,” Farag cried. “The"
6973,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,afflicted of God is the guest of The Excellency Our Governor. We are
6974,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,responsible for every hair of his head.”
6975,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6976,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“He has none,” a voice spoke. “He has the white and the shining mange.”"
6977,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6978,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Now tell them what I have come for, Abdul, and please keep the umbrella"
6979,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,well up. I think I shall reserve myself for my little vernacular speech
6980,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,at the end.”
6981,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6982,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Approach! Look! Listen!” Abdul chanted. “The afflicted of God will now
6983,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"make sport. Presently he will speak in your tongue, and will consume"
6984,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,you with mirth. I have been his servant for three weeks. I will tell you
6985,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,about his undergarments and his perfumes for his head.”
6986,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6987,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,He told them at length.
6988,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6989,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“And didst thou take any of his perfume bottles?” said Farag at the end.
6990,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6991,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“I am his servant. I took two,” Abdul replied."
6992,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6993,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Ask him,” said Farag's uncle, “what he knows about our land-titles. Ye"
6994,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,young men are all alike.” He waved a pamphlet. Mr. Groombride smiled to
6995,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,see how the seed sown in London had borne fruit by Gihon. Lo! All the
6996,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,seniors held copies of the pamphlet.
6997,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
6998,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“He knows less than a buffalo. He told me on the steamer that he was
6999,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,driven out of his own land by Demah-Kerazi which is a devil inhabiting
7000,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"crowds and assemblies,” said Abdul."
7001,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7002,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Allah between us and evil!” a woman cackled from the darkness of a hut.
7003,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Come in, children, he may have the Evil Eye.”"
7004,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7005,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“No, my aunt,” said Farag. “No afflicted of God has an evil eye. Wait"
7006,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,till ye hear his mirth-provoking speech which he will deliver. I have
7007,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,heard it twice from Abdul.”
7008,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7009,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“They seem very quick to grasp the point. How far have you got, Abdul?”"
7010,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7011,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“All about the beatings, sar. They are highly interested.”"
7012,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7013,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Don't forget about the local self-government, and please hold the"
7014,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,umbrella over me. It is hopeless to destroy unless one first builds up.”
7015,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7016,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“He may not have the Evil Eye,” Farag's uncle grunted, “but his devil"
7017,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,led him too certainly to question my land-title. Ask him whether he
7018,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,still doubts my land-title?”
7019,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7020,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Or mine, or mine?” cried the elders."
7021,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7022,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“What odds? He is an afflicted of God,” Farag called. “Remember the tale"
7023,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,I told you.”
7024,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7025,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Yes, but he is an Englishman, and doubtless of influence, or Our"
7026,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Excellency would not entertain him. Bid the down-country jackass ask
7027,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,him.”
7028,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7029,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Sar,” said Abdul, “these people, much fearing they may be turned out"
7030,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,of their land in consequence of your remarks. Therefore they ask you to
7031,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,make promise no bad consequences following your visit.”
7032,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7033,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Mr. Groombride held his breath and turned purple. Then he stamped his
7034,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,foot.
7035,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7036,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Tell them,” he cried, “that if a hair of any one of their heads is"
7037,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"touched by any official on any account whatever, all England shall ring"
7038,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,with it. Good God! What callous oppression! The dark places of the
7039,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"earth are full of cruelty.” He wiped his face, and throwing out his arms"
7040,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"cried: “Tell them, oh! tell the poor serfs not to be afraid of me. Tell"
7041,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"them I come to redress their wrongs--not, heaven knows, to add to their"
7042,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,burden.”
7043,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7044,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The long-drawn gurgle of the practised public speaker pleased them much.
7045,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7046,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“That is how the new water-tap runs out in the kennel,” said Farag. “The"
7047,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Excellency Our Governor entertains him that he may make sport. Make him
7048,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,say the mirth-moving speech.”
7049,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7050,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“What did he say about my land-titles?” Farag's uncle was not to be
7051,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,turned.
7052,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7053,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“He says,” Farag interpreted, “that he desires, nothing better than that"
7054,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,you should live on your lands in peace. He talks as though he believed
7055,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,himself to be Governor.”
7056,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7057,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Well. We here are all witnesses to what he has said. Now go forward
7058,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,with the sport.” Farag's uncle smoothed his garments. “How diversely
7059,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,hath Allah made His creatures! On one He bestows strength to slay Emirs;
7060,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"another He causes to go mad and wander in the sun, like the afflicted"
7061,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,sons of Melik-meid.”
7062,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7063,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Yes, and to emit spray from the mouth, as the Inspector told us. All"
7064,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"will happen as the Inspector foretold,” said Farag. “I have never yet"
7065,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,seen the Inspector thrown out during any run.”
7066,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7067,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“I think,” Abdul plucked at Mr. Groombride's sleeves, “I think perhaps"
7068,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"it is better now, Sar, if you give your fine little native speech. They"
7069,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"not understanding English, but much pleased at your condescensions.”"
7070,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7071,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,“Condescensions?” Mr. Groombride spun round. “If they only knew how
7072,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,I felt towards them in my heart! If I could express a tithe of my
7073,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"feelings! I must stay here and learn the language. Hold up the umbrella,"
7074,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Abdul! I think my little speech will show them I know something of their
7075,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,vie intime.”
7076,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7077,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"It was a short, simple, carefully learned address, and the accent,"
7078,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"supervised by Abdul on the steamer, allowed the hearers to guess its"
7079,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"meaning, which was a request to see one of the Mudir's Cranes; since the"
7080,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"desire of the speaker's life, the object to which he would consecrate"
7081,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"his days, was to improve the condition of the Mudir's Cranes. But first"
7082,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"he must behold them with his own eyes. Would, then, his brethren, whom"
7083,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"he loved, show him a Mudir's Crane whom he desired to love?"
7084,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7085,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Once, twice, and again in his peroration he repeated his demand,"
7086,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,using always--that they might see he was acquainted with their local
7087,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"argot--using always, I say, the word which the Inspector had given"
7088,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"him in England long ago--the short, adhesive word which, by itself,"
7089,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,surprises even unblushing Ethiopia.
7090,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7091,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,There are limits to the sublime politeness of an ancient people. A
7092,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"bulky, blue-chinned man in white clothes, his name red-lettered across"
7093,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"his lower shirtfront, spluttering from under a green-lined umbrella"
7094,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,almost tearful appeals to be introduced to the Unintroducible; naming
7095,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"loudly the Unnameable; dancing, as it seemed, in perverse joy at mere"
7096,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,mention of the Unmentionable--found those limits. There was a moment's
7097,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"hush, and then such mirth as Gihon through his centuries had never"
7098,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,heard--a roar like to the roar of his own cataracts in flood. Children
7099,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"cast themselves on the ground, and rolled back and forth cheering and"
7100,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"whooping; strong men, their faces hidden in their clothes, swayed in"
7101,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"silence, till the agony became insupportable, and they threw up their"
7102,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"heads and bayed at the sun; women, mothers and virgins, shrilled shriek"
7103,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"upon mounting shriek, and slapped their thighs as it might have been the"
7104,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"roll of musketry. When they tried to draw breath, some half-strangled"
7105,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"voice would quack out the word, and the riot began afresh. Last to fall"
7106,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"was the city-trained Abdul. He held on to the edge of apoplexy, then"
7107,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"collapsed, throwing the umbrella from him."
7108,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7109,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Mr. Groombride should not be judged too harshly. Exercise and strong
7110,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"emotion under a hot sun, the shock of public ingratitude, for the moment"
7111,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"rued his spirit. He furled the umbrella, and with it beat the prostrate"
7112,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"Abdul, crying that he had been betrayed."
7113,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7114,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"In which posture the Inspector, on horseback, followed by the Governor,"
7115,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,suddenly found him.
7116,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7117,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,*      *      *      *      *
7118,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7119,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“That's all very well,” said the Inspector, when he had taken Abdul's"
7120,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"dramatically dying depositions on the steamer, “but you can't hammer a"
7121,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,native merely because he laughs at you. I see nothing for it but the law
7122,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,to take its course.”
7123,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7124,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“You might reduce the charge to--er--tampering with an interpreter,”"
7125,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,said the Governor. Mr. Groombride was too far gone to be comforted.
7126,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7127,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“It's the publicity that I fear,” he wailed. “Is there no possible"
7128,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,means of hushing up the affair? You don't know what a question--a single
7129,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,question in the House means to a man of my position--the ruin of my
7130,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"political career, I assure you.”"
7131,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7132,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“I shouldn't have imagined it,” said the Governor thoughtfully."
7133,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7134,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“And, though perhaps I ought not to say it, I am not without honour"
7135,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"in my own country--or influence. A word in season, as you know, Your"
7136,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,Excellency. It might carry an official far.”
7137,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7138,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,The Governor shuddered.
7139,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7140,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"“Yes, that had to come too,” he said to himself. “Well, look here. If I"
7141,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"tell this man of yours to withdraw the charge against you, you can go"
7142,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,to Gehenna for aught I care. The only condition I make is that if you
7143,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,"write--I suppose that's part of your--business about your travels, you"
7144,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,don't praise me!”
7145,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,
7146,A TALE OF THE GIHON HUNT,So far Mr. Groombride has loyally adhered to this understanding.

7194,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"On an evening after Easter Day, I sat at a table in a homeward bound"
7195,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"steamer's smoking-room, where half a dozen of us told ghost stories. As"
7196,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"our party broke up a man, playing Patience in the next alcove, said to"
7197,THE HOUSE SURGEON,me: “I didn't quite catch the end of that last story about the Curse on
7198,THE HOUSE SURGEON,the family's first-born.”
7199,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7200,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“It turned out to be drains,” I explained. “As soon as new ones were put"
7201,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"into the house the Curse was lifted, I believe. I never knew the people"
7202,THE HOUSE SURGEON,myself.”
7203,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7204,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Ah! I've had my drains up twice; I'm on gravel too.”
7205,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7206,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“You don't mean to say you've a ghost in your house? Why didn't you join

7208,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7209,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Any more orders, gentlemen, before the bar closes?” the steward"
7210,THE HOUSE SURGEON,interrupted.
7211,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7212,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Sit down again, and have one with me,” said the Patience player. “No,"
7213,THE HOUSE SURGEON,it isn't a ghost. Our trouble is more depression than anything else.”
7214,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7215,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“How interesting? Then it's nothing any one can see?”
7216,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7217,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“It's--it's nothing worse than a little depression. And the odd part is
7218,THE HOUSE SURGEON,that there hasn't been a death in the house since it was built--in 1863.
7219,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"The lawyer said so. That decided me--my good lady, rather--and he made me"
7220,THE HOUSE SURGEON,pay an extra thousand for it.”
7221,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7222,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“How curious. Unusual, too!” I said."
7223,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7224,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Yes; ain't it? It was built for three sisters--Moultrie was the
7225,THE HOUSE SURGEON,name--three old maids. They all lived together; the eldest owned it. I
7226,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"bought it from her lawyer a few years ago, and if I've spent a pound"
7227,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"on the place first and last, I must have spent five thousand. Electric"
7228,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"light, new servants' wing, garden--all that sort of thing. A man and his"

7232,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Does it affect your family much?”
7233,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7234,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“My good lady--she's a Greek, by the way--and myself are middle-aged. We"

7236,THE HOUSE SURGEON,little; but she's twenty. We send her visiting to escape it. She almost
7237,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"lived at hotels and hydros, last year, but that isn't pleasant for her."
7238,THE HOUSE SURGEON,She used to be a canary--a perfect canary--always singing. You ought to

7244,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Not except at a sacrifice, and we are fond of it. Just suits us three."
7245,THE HOUSE SURGEON,We'd love it if we were allowed.”
7246,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7247,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“What do you mean by not being allowed?”
7248,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7249,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“I mean because of the depression. It spoils everything.”
7250,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7251,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“What's it like exactly?”
7252,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7253,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I couldn't very well explain. It must be seen to be appreciated, as the"
7254,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"auctioneers say. Now, I was much impressed by the story you were telling"
7255,THE HOUSE SURGEON,just now.”
7256,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7257,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“It wasn't true,” I said."
7258,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7259,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“My tale is true. If you would do me the pleasure to come down and spend
7260,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"a night at my little place, you'd learn more than you would if I talked"
7261,THE HOUSE SURGEON,till morning. Very likely 'twouldn't touch your good self at all.
7262,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"You might be--immune, ain't it? On the other hand, if this"
7263,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"influenza,--influence does happen to affect you, why, I think it will be"
7264,THE HOUSE SURGEON,an experience.”
7265,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7266,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"While he talked he gave me his card, and I read his name was L. Maxwell"
7267,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"M'Leod, Esq., of Holmescroft. A City address was tucked away in a"
7268,THE HOUSE SURGEON,corner.
7269,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7270,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“My business,” he added, “used to be furs. If you are interested in"
7271,THE HOUSE SURGEON,furs--I've given thirty years of my life to 'em.”
7272,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7273,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You're very kind,” I murmured."
7274,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7275,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Far from it, I assure you. I can meet you next Saturday afternoon"
7276,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"anywhere in London you choose to name, and I'll be only too happy to"
7277,THE HOUSE SURGEON,motor you down. It ought to be a delightful run at this time of year--the
7278,THE HOUSE SURGEON,rhododendrons will be out. I mean it. You don't know how truly I mean
7279,THE HOUSE SURGEON,it. Very probably--it won't affect you at all. And--I think I may say I
7280,THE HOUSE SURGEON,have the finest collection of narwhal tusks in the world. All the best
7281,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"skins and horns have to go through London, and L. Maxwell M'Leod, he"
7282,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"knows where they come from, and where they go to. That's his business.”"
7283,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7284,THE HOUSE SURGEON,For the rest of the voyage up-channel Mr. M'Leod talked to me of the
7285,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"assembling, preparation, and sale of the rarer furs; and told me things"
7286,THE HOUSE SURGEON,about the manufacture of fur-lined coats which quite shocked me. Somehow
7287,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"or other, when we landed on Wednesday, I found myself pledged to spend"
7288,THE HOUSE SURGEON,that week-end with him at Holmescroft.
7289,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7290,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"On Saturday he met me with a well-groomed motor, and ran me out, in an"
7291,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"hour and a half, to an exclusive residential district of dustless roads"
7292,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and elegantly designed country villas, each standing in from three to"
7293,THE HOUSE SURGEON,five acres of perfectly appointed land. He told me land was selling at
7294,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"eight hundred pounds the acre, and the new golf links, whose Queen"
7295,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Anne pavilion we passed, had cost nearly twenty-four thousand pounds to"
7296,THE HOUSE SURGEON,create.
7297,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7298,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Holmescroft was a large, two-storied, low, creeper-covered residence."
7299,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"A verandah at the south side gave on to a garden and two tennis courts,"
7300,THE HOUSE SURGEON,separated by a tasteful iron fence from a most park-like meadow of five
7301,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"or six acres, where two Jersey cows grazed. Tea was ready in the shade"
7302,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of a promising copper beech, and I could see groups on the lawn of"
7303,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"young men and maidens appropriately clothed, playing lawn tennis in the"
7304,THE HOUSE SURGEON,sunshine.
7305,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7306,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“A pretty scene, ain't it?” said Mr. M'Leod. “My good lady's sitting"
7307,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"under the tree, and that's my little girl in pink on the far court. But"
7308,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I'll take you to your room, and you can see 'em all later.”"
7309,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7310,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"He led me through a wide parquet-floored hall furnished in pale lemon,"
7311,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"with huge Cloisonnée vases, an ebonized and gold grand piano, and banks"
7312,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of pot flowers in Benares brass bowls, up a pale oak staircase to a"
7313,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"spacious landing, where there was a green velvet settee trimmed with"
7314,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"silver. The blinds were down, and the light lay in parallel lines on the"
7315,THE HOUSE SURGEON,floors.
7316,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7317,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"He showed me my room, saying cheerfully: “You may be a little tired. One"
7318,THE HOUSE SURGEON,often is without knowing it after a run through traffic. Don't come down
7319,THE HOUSE SURGEON,till you feel quite restored. We shall all be in the garden.”
7320,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7321,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"My room was rather warm, and smelt of perfumed soap. I threw up the"
7322,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"window at once, but it opened so close to the floor and worked so"
7323,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"clumsily that I came within an ace of pitching out, where I should"
7324,THE HOUSE SURGEON,certainly have ruined a rather lop-sided laburnum below. As I set about
7325,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"washing off the journey's dust, I began to feel a little tired. But, I"
7326,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"reflected, I had not come down here in this weather and among these new"
7327,THE HOUSE SURGEON,surroundings to be depressed; so I began to whistle.
7328,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7329,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"And it was just then that I was aware of a little grey shadow, as it"
7330,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"might have been a snowflake seen against the light, floating at an"
7331,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"immense distance in the background of my brain. It annoyed me, and I"
7332,THE HOUSE SURGEON,shook my head to get rid of it. Then my brain telegraphed that it was
7333,THE HOUSE SURGEON,the forerunner of a swift-striding gloom which there was yet time to
7334,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"escape if I would force my thoughts away from it, as a man leaping for"
7335,THE HOUSE SURGEON,life forces his body forward and away from the fall of a wall. But the
7336,THE HOUSE SURGEON,gloom overtook me before I could take in the meaning of the message. I
7337,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"moved toward the bed, every nerve already aching with the foreknowledge"
7338,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of the pain that was to be dealt it, and sat down, while my amazed and"
7339,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"angry soul dropped, gulf by gulf, into that horror of great darkness"
7340,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"which is spoken of in the Bible, and which, as auctioneers say, must be"
7341,THE HOUSE SURGEON,experienced to be appreciated.
7342,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7343,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Despair upon despair, misery upon misery, fear after fear, each causing"
7344,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"their distinct and separate woe, packed in upon me for an unrecorded"
7345,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"length of time, until at last they blurred together, and I heard a click"
7346,THE HOUSE SURGEON,in my brain like the click in the ear when one descends in a diving
7347,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"bell, and I knew that the pressures were equalised within and without,"
7348,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and that, for the moment, the worst was at an end. But I knew also that"
7349,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"at any moment the darkness might come down anew; and while, I dwelt on"
7350,THE HOUSE SURGEON,this speculation precisely as a man torments a raging tooth with his
7351,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"tongue, it ebbed away into the little grey shadow on the brain of its"
7352,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"first coming, and once more I heard my brain, which knew what would"
7353,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"recur, telegraph to every quarter for help, release or diversion."
7354,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7355,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"The door opened, and M'Leod reappeared. I thanked him politely, saying"
7356,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I was charmed with my room, anxious to meet Mrs. M'Leod, much refreshed"
7357,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"with my wash, and so on and so forth. Beyond a little stickiness at"
7358,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"the corners of my mouth, it seemed to me that I was managing my words"
7359,THE HOUSE SURGEON,admirably; the while that I myself cowered at the bottom of unclimbable
7360,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"pits. M'Leod laid his hand on my shoulder, and said “You've got it now"
7361,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"already, ain't it?”"
7362,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7363,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Yes,” I answered. “It's making me sick!”"
7364,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7365,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“It will pass off when you come outside. I give you my word it will then
7366,THE HOUSE SURGEON,pass off. Come!”
7367,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7368,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I shambled out behind him, and wiped my forehead in the hall."
7369,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7370,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You musn't mind,” he said. “I expect the run tired you. My good lady is"
7371,THE HOUSE SURGEON,sitting there under the copper beech.”
7372,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7373,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"She was a fat woman in an apricot-coloured gown, with a heavily powdered"
7374,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"face, against which her black long-lashed eyes showed like currants"
7375,THE HOUSE SURGEON,in dough. I was introduced to many fine ladies and gentlemen of those
7376,THE HOUSE SURGEON,parts. Magnificently appointed landaus and covered motors swept in and
7377,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"out of the drive, and the air was gay with the merry outcries of the"
7378,THE HOUSE SURGEON,tennis players.
7379,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7380,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"As twilight drew on they all went away, and I was left alone with Mr."
7381,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and Mrs. M'Leod, while tall menservants and maidservants took away the"
7382,THE HOUSE SURGEON,tennis and tea things. Miss M'Leod had walked a little down the drive
7383,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"with a light-haired young man, who apparently knew everything about"
7384,THE HOUSE SURGEON,every South American railway stock. He had told me at tea that these
7385,THE HOUSE SURGEON,were the days of financial specialisation.
7386,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7387,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I think it went off beautifully, my dear,” said Mr. M'Leod to his wife;"
7388,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and to me: “You feel all right now, ain't it? Of course you do.”"
7389,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7390,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Mrs. M'Leod surged across the gravel. Her husband skipped nimbly before
7391,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"her into the south verandah, turned a switch, and all Holmescroft was"
7392,THE HOUSE SURGEON,flooded with light.
7393,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7394,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You can do that from your room also,” he said as they went in. “There"
7395,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"is something in money, ain't it?”"
7396,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7397,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Miss M'Leod came up behind me in the dusk. “We have not yet been
7398,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"introduced,” she said, “but I suppose you are staying the night?”"
7399,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7400,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Your father was kind enough to ask me,” I replied."
7401,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7402,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"She nodded. “Yes, I know; and you know too, don't you? I saw your face"
7403,THE HOUSE SURGEON,when you came to shake hands with mamma. You felt the depression very
7404,THE HOUSE SURGEON,soon. It is simply frightful in that bedroom sometimes. What do you
7405,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"think it is--bewitchment? In Greece, where I was a little girl, it might"
7406,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"have been; but not in England, do you think? Or do you?”"
7407,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7408,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Cheer up, Thea. It will all come right,” he insisted."
7409,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7410,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“No, papa.” She shook her dark head. “Nothing is right while it comes.”"
7411,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7412,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“It is nothing that we ourselves have ever done in our lives that I
7413,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"will swear to you,” said Mrs. M'Leod suddenly. “And we have changed our"
7414,THE HOUSE SURGEON,servants several times. So we know it is not them.”
7415,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7416,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Never mind. Let us enjoy ourselves while we can,” said Mr. M'Leod,"
7417,THE HOUSE SURGEON,opening the champagne.
7418,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7419,THE HOUSE SURGEON,But we did not enjoy ourselves. The talk failed. There were long
7420,THE HOUSE SURGEON,silences.
7421,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7422,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I beg your pardon,” I said, for I thought some one at my elbow was"
7423,THE HOUSE SURGEON,about to speak.
7424,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7425,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Ah! That is the other thing!” said Miss M'Leod. Her mother groaned.
7426,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7427,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"We were silent again, and, in a few seconds it must have been, a live"
7428,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"grief beyond words--not ghostly dread or horror, but aching, helpless"
7429,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"grief--overwhelmed us, each, I felt, according to his or her nature,"
7430,THE HOUSE SURGEON,and held steady like the beam of a burning glass. Behind that pain I was
7431,THE HOUSE SURGEON,conscious there was a desire on somebody's part to explain something on
7432,THE HOUSE SURGEON,which some tremendously important issue hung.
7433,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7434,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Meantime I rolled bread pills and remembered my sins; M'Leod considered
7435,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"his own reflection in a spoon; his wife seemed to be praying, and the"
7436,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"girl fidgetted desperately with hands and feet, till the darkness passed"
7437,THE HOUSE SURGEON,on--as though the malignant rays of a burning-glass had been shifted
7438,THE HOUSE SURGEON,from us.
7439,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7440,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“There,” said Miss M'Leod, half rising. “Now you see what makes a happy"
7441,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"home. Oh, sell it--sell it, father mine, and let us go away!”"
7442,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7443,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“But I've spent thousands on it. You shall go to Harrogate next week,"
7444,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Thea dear.”
7445,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7446,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“I'm only just back from hotels. I am so tired of packing.”
7447,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7448,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Cheer up, Thea. It is over. You know it does not often come here twice"
7449,THE HOUSE SURGEON,in the same night. I think we shall dare now to be comfortable.”
7450,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7451,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"He lifted a dish-cover, and helped his wife and daughter. His face was"
7452,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"lined and fallen like an old man's after debauch, but his hand did not"
7453,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"shake, and his voice was clear. As he worked to restore us by speech"
7454,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and action, he reminded me of a grey-muzzled collie herding demoralised"
7455,THE HOUSE SURGEON,sheep.
7456,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7457,THE HOUSE SURGEON,After dinner we sat round the dining-room fire--the drawing-room might
7458,THE HOUSE SURGEON,have been under the Shadow for aught we knew--talking with the intimacy
7459,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of gipsies by the wayside, or of wounded comparing notes after a"
7460,THE HOUSE SURGEON,skirmish. By eleven o'clock the three between them had given me every
7461,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"name and detail they could recall that in any way bore on the house, and"
7462,THE HOUSE SURGEON,what they knew of its history.
7463,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7464,THE HOUSE SURGEON,We went to bed in a fortifying blaze of electric light. My one fear was
7465,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"that the blasting gust of depression would return--the surest way,"
7466,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of course, to bring it. I lay awake till dawn, breathing quickly and"
7467,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"sweating lightly, beneath what De Quincey inadequately describes as"
7468,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“the oppression of inexpiable guilt.” Now as soon as the lovely day was
7469,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"broken, I fell into the most terrible of all dreams--that joyous one in"
7470,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"which all past evil has not only been wiped out of our lives, but has"
7471,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"never been committed; and in the very bliss of our assured innocence,"
7472,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"before our loves shriek and change countenance, we wake to the day we"
7473,THE HOUSE SURGEON,have earned.
7474,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7475,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"It was a coolish morning, but we preferred to breakfast in the south"
7476,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"verandah. The forenoon we spent in the garden, pretending to play games"
7477,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"that come out of boxes, such as croquet and clock golf. But most of the"
7478,THE HOUSE SURGEON,time we drew together and talked. The young man who knew all about South
7479,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"American railways took Miss M'Leod for a walk in the afternoon, and at"
7480,THE HOUSE SURGEON,five M'Leod thoughtfully whirled us all up to dine in town.
7481,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7482,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Now, don't say you will tell the Psychological Society, and that you"
7483,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"will come again,” said Miss M'Leod, as we parted. “Because I know you"
7484,THE HOUSE SURGEON,will not.”
7485,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7486,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You should not say that,” said her mother. “You should say, 'Goodbye,"
7487,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Mr. Perseus. Come again.'”
7488,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7489,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Not him!” the girl cried. “He has seen the Medusa's head!”
7490,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7491,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Looking at myself in the restaurant's mirrors, it seemed to me that I"
7492,THE HOUSE SURGEON,had not much benefited by my week-end. Next morning I wrote out all
7493,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"my Holmescroft notes at fullest length, in the hope that by so doing"
7494,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I could put it all behind me. But the experience worked on my mind, as"
7495,THE HOUSE SURGEON,they say certain imperfectly understood rays work on the body.
7496,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7497,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I am less calculated to make a Sherlock Holmes than any man I know,"
7498,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"for I lack both method and patience, yet the idea of following up the"
7499,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"trouble to its source fascinated me. I had no theory to go on, except"
7500,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"a vague idea that I had come between two poles of a discharge, and had"
7501,THE HOUSE SURGEON,taken a shock meant for some one else. This was followed by a feeling
7502,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of intense irritation. I waited cautiously on myself, expecting to be"
7503,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"overtaken by horror of the supernatural, but my self persisted in"
7504,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"being humanly indignant, exactly as though it had been the victim of"
7505,THE HOUSE SURGEON,a practical joke. It was in great pains and upheavals--that I felt in
7506,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"every fibre but its dominant idea, to put it coarsely, was to get back"
7507,THE HOUSE SURGEON,a bit of its own. By this I knew that I might go forward if I could find
7508,THE HOUSE SURGEON,the way.
7509,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7510,THE HOUSE SURGEON,After a few days it occurred to me to go to the office of Mr. J.M.M.
7511,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Baxter--the solicitor who had sold Holmescroft to M'Leod. I explained I
7512,THE HOUSE SURGEON,had some notion of buying the place. Would he act for me in the matter?
7513,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7514,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Mr. Baxter, a large, greyish, throaty-voiced man, showed no enthusiasm."
7515,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I sold it to Mr. M'Leod,” he said. “It 'ud scarcely do for me to start"
7516,THE HOUSE SURGEON,on the running-down tack now. But I can recommend--”
7517,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7518,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I know he's asking an awful price,” I interrupted, “and atop of it he"
7519,THE HOUSE SURGEON,wants an extra thousand for what he calls your clean bill of health.”
7520,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7521,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Mr. Baxter sat up in his chair. I had all his attention.
7522,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7523,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Your guarantee with the house. Don't you remember it?”
7524,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7525,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Yes, yes. That no death had taken place in the house since it was"
7526,THE HOUSE SURGEON,built: I remember perfectly.”
7527,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7528,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"He did not gulp as untrained men do when they lie, but his jaws moved"
7529,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"stickily, and his eyes, turning towards the deed boxes on the wall,"
7530,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"dulled. I counted seconds, one, two, three--one, two, three up to ten. A"
7531,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"man, I knew, can live through ages of mental depression in that time."
7532,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7533,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“I remember perfectly.” His mouth opened a little as though it had
7534,THE HOUSE SURGEON,tasted old bitterness.
7535,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7536,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Of course that sort of thing doesn't appeal to me.” I went on. “I don't
7537,THE HOUSE SURGEON,expect to buy a house free from death.”
7538,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7539,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Certainly not. No one does. But it was Mr. M'Leod's fancy--his wife's
7540,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"rather, I believe; and since we could meet it--it was my duty to my"
7541,THE HOUSE SURGEON,clients at whatever cost to my own feelings--to make him pay.”
7542,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7543,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“That's really why I came to you. I understood from him you knew the
7544,THE HOUSE SURGEON,place well.”
7545,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7546,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Oh, yes. Always did. It originally belonged to some connections of"
7547,THE HOUSE SURGEON,mine.”
7548,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7549,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“The Misses Moultrie, I suppose. How interesting! They must have loved"
7550,THE HOUSE SURGEON,the place before the country round about was built up.”
7551,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7552,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“They were very fond of it indeed.”
7553,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7554,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“I don't wonder. So restful and sunny. I don't see how they could have
7555,THE HOUSE SURGEON,brought themselves to part with it.”
7556,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7557,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Now it is one of the most constant peculiarities of the English that in
7558,THE HOUSE SURGEON,polite conversation--and I had striven to be polite--no one ever does or
7559,THE HOUSE SURGEON,sells anything for mere money's sake.
7560,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7561,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Miss Agnes--the youngest--fell ill” (he spaced his words a little),"
7562,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“and, as they were very much attached to each other, that broke up the"
7563,THE HOUSE SURGEON,home.”
7564,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7565,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Naturally. I fancied it must have been something of that kind.
7566,THE HOUSE SURGEON,One doesn't associate the Staffordshire Moultries” (my Demon of
7567,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Irresponsibility at that instant created 'em), “with--with being hard"
7568,THE HOUSE SURGEON,up.”
7569,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7570,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I don't know whether we're related to them,” he answered importantly."
7571,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“We may be, for our branch of the family comes from the Midlands.”"
7572,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7573,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I give this talk at length, because I am so proud of my first attempt at"
7574,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"detective work. When I left him, twenty minutes later, with instructions"
7575,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"to move against the owner of Holmescroft, with a view to purchase, I was"
7576,THE HOUSE SURGEON,more bewildered than any Doctor Watson at the opening of a story.
7577,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7578,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Why should a middle-aged solicitor turn plovers' egg colour and drop his
7579,THE HOUSE SURGEON,jaw when reminded of so innocent and festal a matter as that no death
7580,THE HOUSE SURGEON,had ever occurred in a house that he had sold? If I knew my English
7581,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"vocabulary at all, the tone in which he said the youngest sister “fell"
7582,THE HOUSE SURGEON,ill” meant that she had gone out of her mind. That might explain his
7583,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"change of countenance, and it was just possible that her demented"
7584,THE HOUSE SURGEON,influence still hung about Holmescroft; but the rest was beyond me.
7585,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7586,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I was relieved when I reached M'Leod's City office, and could tell him"
7587,THE HOUSE SURGEON,what I had done--not what I thought.
7588,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7589,THE HOUSE SURGEON,M'Leod was quite willing to enter into the game of the pretended
7590,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"purchase, but did not see how it would help if I knew Baxter."
7591,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7592,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“He's the only living soul I can get at who was connected with
7593,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Holmescroft,” I said."
7594,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7595,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Ah! Living soul is good,” said M'Leod. “At any rate our little girl"
7596,THE HOUSE SURGEON,will be pleased that you are still interested in us. Won't you come down
7597,THE HOUSE SURGEON,some day this week?”
7598,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7599,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“How is it there now?” I asked.
7600,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7601,THE HOUSE SURGEON,He screwed up his face. “Simply frightful!” he said. “Thea is at
7602,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Droitwich.”
7603,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7604,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I should like it immensely, but I must cultivate Baxter for the"
7605,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"present. You'll be sure and keep him busy your end, won't you?”"
7606,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7607,THE HOUSE SURGEON,He looked at me with quiet contempt. “Do not be afraid. I shall be a
7608,THE HOUSE SURGEON,good Jew. I shall be my own solicitor.”
7609,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7610,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Before a fortnight was over, Baxter admitted ruefully that M'Leod"
7611,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"was better than most firms in the business: We buyers were coy,"
7612,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"argumentative, shocked at the price of Holmescroft, inquisitive, and"
7613,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"cold by turns, but Mr. M'Leod the seller easily met and surpassed us;"
7614,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and Mr. Baxter entered every letter, telegram, and consultation at the"
7615,THE HOUSE SURGEON,proper rates in a cinematograph-film of a bill. At the end of a month
7616,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"he said it looked as though M'Leod, thanks to him, were really going"
7617,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"to listen to reason. I was many pounds out of pocket, but I had learned"
7618,THE HOUSE SURGEON,something of Mr. Baxter on the human side. I deserved it. Never in my
7619,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"life have I worked to conciliate, amuse, and flatter a human being as I"
7620,THE HOUSE SURGEON,worked over my solicitor.
7621,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7622,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"It appeared that he golfed. Therefore, I was an enthusiastic beginner,"
7623,THE HOUSE SURGEON,anxious to learn. Twice I invaded his office with a bag (M'Leod lent it)
7624,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"full of the spelicans needed in this detestable game, and a vocabulary"
7625,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"to match. The third time the ice broke, and Mr. Baxter took me to his"
7626,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"links, quite ten miles off, where in a maze of tramway lines, railroads,"
7627,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and nursery-maids, we skelped our divotted way round nine holes like"
7628,THE HOUSE SURGEON,barges plunging through head seas. He played vilely and had never
7629,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"expected to meet any one worse; but as he realised my form, I think"
7630,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"he began to like me, for he took me in hand by the two hours together."
7631,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"After a fortnight he could give me no more than a stroke a hole, and"
7632,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"when, with this allowance, I once managed to beat him by one, he was"
7633,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"honestly glad, and assured me that I should be a golfer if I stuck"
7634,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"to it. I was sticking to it for my own ends, but now and again my"
7635,THE HOUSE SURGEON,conscience pricked me; for the man was a nice man. Between games he
7636,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"supplied me with odd pieces of evidence, such as that he had known the"
7637,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Moultries all his life, being their cousin, and that Miss Mary, the"
7638,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"eldest, was an unforgiving woman who would never let bygones be."
7639,THE HOUSE SURGEON,I naturally wondered what she might have against him; and somehow
7640,THE HOUSE SURGEON,connected him unfavourably with mad Agnes.
7641,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7642,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“People ought to forgive and forget,” he volunteered one day between"
7643,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"rounds. “Specially where, in the nature of things, they can't be sure of"
7644,THE HOUSE SURGEON,their deductions. Don't you think so?”
7645,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7646,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“It all depends on the nature of the evidence on which one forms one's
7647,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"judgment,” I answered."
7648,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7649,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Nonsense!” he cried. “I'm lawyer enough to know that there's nothing in
7650,THE HOUSE SURGEON,the world so misleading as circumstantial evidence. Never was.”
7651,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7652,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Why? Have you ever seen men hanged on it?”
7653,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7654,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Hanged? People have been supposed to be eternally lost on it,” his face"
7655,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"turned grey again. “I don't know how it is with you, but my consolation"
7656,THE HOUSE SURGEON,is that God must know. He must! Things that seem on the face of 'em like
7657,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"murder, or say suicide, may appear different to God. Heh?”"
7658,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7659,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“That's what the murderer and the suicide can always hope--I suppose.”
7660,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7661,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“I have expressed myself clumsily as usual. The facts as God knows
7662,THE HOUSE SURGEON,'em--may be different--even after the most clinching evidence. I've
7663,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"always said that--both as a lawyer and a man, but some people won't--I"
7664,THE HOUSE SURGEON,don't want to judge 'em--we'll say they can't--believe it; whereas I
7665,THE HOUSE SURGEON,say there's always a working chance--a certainty--that the worst hasn't
7666,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"happened.” He stopped and cleared his throat. “Now, let's come on! This"
7667,THE HOUSE SURGEON,time next week I shall be taking my holiday.”
7668,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7669,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“What links?” I asked carelessly, while twins in a perambulator got out"
7670,THE HOUSE SURGEON,of our line of fire.
7671,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7672,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“A potty little nine-hole affair at a hydro in the Midlands. My cousins
7673,THE HOUSE SURGEON,stay there. Always will. Not but what the fourth and the seventh holes
7674,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"take some doing. You could manage it, though,” he said encouragingly."
7675,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“You're doing much better. It's only your approach shots that are weak.”
7676,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7677,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“You're right. I can't approach for nuts! I shall go to pieces while
7678,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"you're away--with no one to coach me,” I said mournfully."
7679,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7680,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I haven't taught you anything,” he said, delighted with the compliment."
7681,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7682,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I owe all I've learned to you, anyhow. When will you come back?”"
7683,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7684,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Look here,” he began. “I don't know, your engagements, but I've no one"
7685,THE HOUSE SURGEON,to play with at Burry Mills. Never have. Why couldn't you take a few
7686,THE HOUSE SURGEON,days off and join me there? I warn you it will be rather dull. It's a
7687,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"throat and gout place--baths, massage, electricity, and so forth. But the"
7688,THE HOUSE SURGEON,fourth and the seventh holes really take some doing.”
7689,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7690,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I'm for the game,” I answered valiantly; Heaven well knowing that I"
7691,THE HOUSE SURGEON,hated every stroke and word of it.
7692,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7693,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“That's the proper spirit. As their lawyer I must ask you not to say
7694,THE HOUSE SURGEON,anything to my cousins about Holmescroft. It upsets 'em. Always did. But
7695,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"speaking as man to man, it would be very pleasant for me if you could"
7696,THE HOUSE SURGEON,see your way to--”
7697,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7698,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I saw it as soon as decency permitted, and thanked him sincerely."
7699,THE HOUSE SURGEON,According to my now well-developed theory he had certainly
7700,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"misappropriated his aged cousins' monies under power of attorney, and"
7701,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"had probably driven poor Agnes Moultrie out of her wits, but I wished"
7702,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"that he was not so gentle, and good-tempered, and innocent eyed."
7703,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7704,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Before I joined him at Burry Mills Hydro, I spent a night at"
7705,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Holmescroft. Miss M'Leod had returned from her Hydro, and first we made"
7706,THE HOUSE SURGEON,very merry on the open lawn in the sunshine over the manners and customs
7707,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of the English resorting to such places. She knew dozens of hydros, and"
7708,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"warned me how to behave in them, while Mr. and Mrs. M'Leod stood aside"
7709,THE HOUSE SURGEON,and adored her.
7710,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7711,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Ah! That's the way she always comes back to us,” he said. “Pity it"
7712,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"wears off so soon, ain't it? You ought to hear her sing 'With mirth thou"
7713,THE HOUSE SURGEON,pretty bird.'”
7714,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7715,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"We had the house to face through the evening, and there we neither"
7716,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"laughed nor sung. The gloom fell on us as we entered, and did not shift"
7717,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"till ten o'clock, when we crawled out, as it were, from beneath it."
7718,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7719,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“It has been bad this summer,” said Mrs. M'Leod in a whisper after we"
7720,THE HOUSE SURGEON,realised that we were freed. “Sometimes I think the house will get up
7721,THE HOUSE SURGEON,and cry out--it is so bad.”
7722,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7723,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“How?”
7724,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7725,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Have you forgotten what comes after the depression?”
7726,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7727,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"So then we waited about the small fire, and the dead air in the room"
7728,THE HOUSE SURGEON,presently filled and pressed down upon us with the sensation (but words
7729,THE HOUSE SURGEON,are useless here) as though some dumb and bound power were striving
7730,THE HOUSE SURGEON,against gag and bond to deliver its soul of an articulate word. It
7731,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"passed in a few minutes, and I fell to thinking about Mr. Baxter's"
7732,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"conscience and Agnes Moultrie, gone mad in the well-lit bedroom"
7733,THE HOUSE SURGEON,that waited me. These reflections secured me a night during which I
7734,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"rediscovered how, from purely mental causes, a man can be physically"
7735,THE HOUSE SURGEON,sick; but the sickness was bliss compared to my dreams when the birds
7736,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"waked. On my departure, M'Leod gave me a beautiful narwhal's horn, much"
7737,THE HOUSE SURGEON,as a nurse gives a child sweets for being brave at a dentist's.
7738,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7739,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“There's no duplicate of it in the world,” he said, “else it would have"
7740,THE HOUSE SURGEON,come to old Max M'Leod;” and he tucked it into the motor. Miss M'Leod
7741,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"on the far side of the car whispered, “Have you found out anything, Mr."
7742,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Perseus?”
7743,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7744,THE HOUSE SURGEON,I shook my head.
7745,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7746,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Then I shall be chained to my rock all my life,” she went on. “Only"
7747,THE HOUSE SURGEON,don't tell papa.”
7748,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7749,THE HOUSE SURGEON,I supposed she was thinking of the young gentleman who specialised in
7750,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"South American rails, for I noticed a ring on the third finger of her"
7751,THE HOUSE SURGEON,left hand.
7752,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7753,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I went straight from that house to Burry Mills Hydro, keen for the first"
7754,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"time in my life on playing golf, which is guaranteed to occupy the mind."
7755,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Baxter had taken me a room communicating with his own, and after lunch"
7756,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"introduced me to a tall, horse-headed elderly lady of decided manners,"
7757,THE HOUSE SURGEON,whom a white-haired maid pushed along in a bath-chair through the
7758,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"park-like grounds of the Hydro. She was Miss Mary Moultrie, and she"
7759,THE HOUSE SURGEON,coughed and cleared her throat just like Baxter. She suffered--she
7760,THE HOUSE SURGEON,told me it was a Moultrie castemark--from some obscure form of chronic
7761,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"bronchitis, complicated with spasm of the glottis; and, in a dead, flat"
7762,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"voice, with a sunken eye that looked and saw not, told me what washes,"
7763,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"gargles, pastilles, and inhalations she had proved most beneficial. From"
7764,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"her I was passed on to her younger sister, Miss Elizabeth, a small and"
7765,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"withered thing with twitching lips, victim, she told me, to very"
7766,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"much the same sort of throat, but secretly devoted to another set of"
7767,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"medicines. When she went away with Baxter and the bath-chair, I fell"
7768,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"across a major of the Indian army with gout in his glassy eyes, and a"
7769,THE HOUSE SURGEON,stomach which he had taken all round the Continent. He laid everything
7770,THE HOUSE SURGEON,before me; and him I escaped only to be confided in by a matron with
7771,THE HOUSE SURGEON,a tendency to follicular tonsilitis and eczema. Baxter waited hand and
7772,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"foot on his cousins till five o'clock, trying, as I saw, to atone for"
7773,THE HOUSE SURGEON,his treatment of the dead sister. Miss Mary ordered him about like a
7774,THE HOUSE SURGEON,dog.
7775,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7776,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I warned you it would be dull,” he said when we met in the"
7777,THE HOUSE SURGEON,smoking-room.
7778,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7779,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“It's tremendously interesting,” I said. “But how about a look round the"
7780,THE HOUSE SURGEON,links?”
7781,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7782,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Unluckily damp always affects my eldest cousin. I've got to buy her a
7783,THE HOUSE SURGEON,new bronchitis-kettle. Arthurs broke her old one yesterday.”
7784,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7785,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"We slipped out to the chemist's shop in the town, and he bought a large"
7786,THE HOUSE SURGEON,glittering tin thing whose workings he explained.
7787,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7788,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I'm used to this sort of work. I come up here pretty often,” he said."
7789,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“I've the family throat too.”
7790,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7791,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You're a good man,” I said. “A very good man.”"
7792,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7793,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"He turned towards me in the evening light among the beeches, and his"
7794,THE HOUSE SURGEON,face was changed to what it might have been a generation before.
7795,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7796,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You see,” he said huskily, “there was the youngest--Agnes. Before"
7797,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"she fell ill, you know. But she didn't like leaving her sisters. Never"
7798,THE HOUSE SURGEON,would.” He hurried on with his odd-shaped load and left me among the
7799,THE HOUSE SURGEON,ruins of my black theories. The man with that face had done Agnes
7800,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Moultrie no wrong.
7801,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7802,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7803,THE HOUSE SURGEON,We never played our game. I was waked between two and three in the
7804,THE HOUSE SURGEON,morning from my hygienic bed by Baxter in an ulster over orange and
7805,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"white pyjamas, which I should never have suspected from his character."
7806,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7807,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“My cousin has had some sort of a seizure,” he said. “Will you come? I"
7808,THE HOUSE SURGEON,don't want to wake the doctor. Don't want to make a scandal. Quick!”
7809,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7810,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"So I came quickly, and led by the white-haired Arthurs in a jacket and"
7811,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"petticoat, entered a double-bedded room reeking with steam and Friar's"
7812,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Balsam. The electrics were all on. Miss Mary--I knew her by her
7813,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"height--was at the open window, wrestling with Miss Elizabeth, who"
7814,THE HOUSE SURGEON,gripped her round the knees.
7815,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7816,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Miss Mary's hand was at her own throat, which was streaked with blood."
7817,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7818,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“She's done it. She's done it too!” Miss Elizabeth panted. “Hold her!
7819,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Help me!”
7820,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7821,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Oh, I say! Women don't cut their throats,” Baxter whispered."
7822,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7823,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“My God! Has she cut her throat?” the maid cried out, and with no"
7824,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"warning rolled over in a faint. Baxter pushed her under the wash-basins,"
7825,THE HOUSE SURGEON,and leaped to hold the gaunt woman who crowed and whistled as she
7826,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"struggled toward the window. He took her by the shoulder, and she struck"
7827,THE HOUSE SURGEON,out wildly:
7828,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7829,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“All right! She's only cut her hand,” he said. “Wet towel quick!”"
7830,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7831,THE HOUSE SURGEON,While I got that he pushed her backward. Her strength seemed almost as
7832,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"great as his. I swabbed at her throat when I could, and found no mark;"
7833,THE HOUSE SURGEON,then helped him to control her a little. Miss Elizabeth leaped back to
7834,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"bed, wailing like a child."
7835,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7836,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Tie up her hand somehow,” said Baxter. “Don't let it drip about the"
7837,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"place. She”--he stepped on broken glass in his slippers, “she must have"
7838,THE HOUSE SURGEON,smashed a pane.”
7839,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7840,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Miss Mary lurched towards the open window again, dropped on her knees,"
7841,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"her head on the sill, and lay quiet, surrendering the cut hand to me."
7842,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7843,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“What did she do?” Baxter turned towards Miss Elizabeth in the far bed.
7844,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7845,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“She was going to throw herself out of the window,” was the answer."
7846,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I stopped her, and sent Arthurs for you. Oh, we can never hold up our"
7847,THE HOUSE SURGEON,heads again!”
7848,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7849,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Miss Mary writhed and fought for breath. Baxter found a shawl which he
7850,THE HOUSE SURGEON,threw over her shoulders.
7851,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7852,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Nonsense!” said he. “That isn't like Mary;” but his face worked when he
7853,THE HOUSE SURGEON,said it.
7854,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7855,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You wouldn't believe about Aggie, John. Perhaps you will now!” said"
7856,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Miss Elizabeth. “I saw her do it, and she's cut her throat too!”"
7857,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7858,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“She hasn't,” I said. “It's only her hand.”"
7859,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7860,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Miss Mary suddenly broke from us with an indescribable grunt, flew,"
7861,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"rather than ran, to her sister's bed, and there shook her as one furious"
7862,THE HOUSE SURGEON,schoolgirl would shake another.
7863,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7864,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“No such thing,” she croaked. “How dare you think so, you wicked little"
7865,THE HOUSE SURGEON,fool?”
7866,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7867,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Get into bed, Mary,” said Baxter. “You'll catch a chill.”"
7868,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7869,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"She obeyed, but sat up with the grey shawl round her lean shoulders,"
7870,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"glaring at her sister. “I'm better now,” she panted. “Arthurs let me"
7871,THE HOUSE SURGEON,sit out too long. Where's Arthurs? The kettle.”
7872,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7873,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Never mind Arthurs,” said Baxter. “You get the kettle.” I hastened to"
7874,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"bring it from the side table. “Now, Mary, as God sees you, tell me what"
7875,THE HOUSE SURGEON,you've done.”
7876,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7877,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"His lips were dry, and he could not moisten. them with his tongue."
7878,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7879,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Miss Mary applied herself to the mouth of the kettle, and between"
7880,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"indraws of steam said: “The spasm came on just now, while I was asleep."
7881,THE HOUSE SURGEON,I was nearly choking to death. So I went to the window I've done it
7882,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"often before, without waking any one. Bessie's such an old maid about"
7883,THE HOUSE SURGEON,draughts. I tell you I was choking to death. I couldn't manage the
7884,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"catch, and I nearly fell out. That window opens too low. I cut my hand"
7885,THE HOUSE SURGEON,trying to save myself. Who has tied it up in this filthy handkerchief?
7886,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I wish you had had my throat, Bessie. I never was nearer dying!” She"
7887,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"scowled on us all impartially, while her sister sobbed."
7888,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7889,THE HOUSE SURGEON,From the bottom of the bed we heard a quivering voice: “Is she dead?
7890,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Have they took her away? Oh, I never could bear the sight o' blood!”"
7891,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7892,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Arthurs,” said Miss Mary, “you are an hireling. Go away!”"
7893,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7894,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"It is my belief that Arthurs crawled out on all fours, but I was busy"
7895,THE HOUSE SURGEON,picking up broken glass from the carpet.
7896,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7897,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Then Baxter, seated by the side of the bed, began to cross-examine in"
7898,THE HOUSE SURGEON,a voice I scarcely recognised. No one could for an instant have doubted
7899,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"the genuine rage of Miss Mary against her sister, her cousin, or her"
7900,THE HOUSE SURGEON,maid; and that a doctor should have been called in--for she did me the
7901,THE HOUSE SURGEON,honour of calling me doctor--was the last drop. She was choking with her
7902,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"throat; had rushed to the window for air; had near pitched out, and in"
7903,THE HOUSE SURGEON,catching at the window bars had cut her hand. Over and over she made
7904,THE HOUSE SURGEON,this clear to the intent Baxter. Then she turned on her sister and
7905,THE HOUSE SURGEON,tongue-lashed her savagely.
7906,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7907,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You mustn't blame me,” Miss Bessie faltered at last. “You know what we"
7908,THE HOUSE SURGEON,think of night and day.”
7909,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7910,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I'm coming to that,” said Baxter. “Listen to me. What you did,"
7911,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Mary, misled four people into thinking you--you meant to do away with"
7912,THE HOUSE SURGEON,yourself.”
7913,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7914,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Isn't one suicide in the family enough? Oh God, help and pity us! You"
7915,THE HOUSE SURGEON,couldn't have believed that!” she cried.
7916,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7917,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“The evidence was complete. Now, don't you think,” Baxter's finger"
7918,THE HOUSE SURGEON,wagged under her nose--“can't you think that poor Aggie did the same
7919,THE HOUSE SURGEON,thing at Holmescroft when she fell out of the window?”
7920,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7921,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“She had the same throat,” said Miss Elizabeth. “Exactly the same"
7922,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"symptoms. Don't you remember, Mary?”"
7923,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7924,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Which was her bedroom?” I asked of Baxter in an undertone.
7925,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7926,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Over the south verandah, looking on to the tennis lawn.”"
7927,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7928,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“I nearly fell out of that very window when I was at
7929,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Holmescroft--opening it to get some air. The sill doesn't come much
7930,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"above your knees,” I said."
7931,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7932,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You hear that, Mary? Mary, do you hear what this gentleman says? Won't"
7933,THE HOUSE SURGEON,you believe that what nearly happened to you must have happened to
7934,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"poor Aggie that night? For God's sake--for her sake--Mary, won't you"
7935,THE HOUSE SURGEON,believe?”
7936,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7937,THE HOUSE SURGEON,There was a long silence while the steam kettle puffed.
7938,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7939,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“If I could have proof--if I could have proof,” said she, and broke into"
7940,THE HOUSE SURGEON,most horrible tears.
7941,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7942,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Baxter motioned to me, and I crept away to my room, and lay awake till"
7943,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"morning, thinking more specially of the dumb Thing at Holmescroft which"
7944,THE HOUSE SURGEON,wished to explain itself. I hated Miss Mary as perfectly as though I had
7945,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"known her for twenty years, but I felt that, alive or dead, I should not"
7946,THE HOUSE SURGEON,like her to condemn me.
7947,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7948,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Yet at mid-day, when I saw Miss Mary in her bathchair, Arthurs behind"
7949,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and Baxter and Miss Elizabeth on either side, in the park-like grounds"
7950,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of the Hydro, I found it difficult to arrange my words."
7951,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7952,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Now that you know all about it,” said Baxter aside, after the first"
7953,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"strangeness of our meeting was over, “it's only fair to tell you that"
7954,THE HOUSE SURGEON,my poor cousin did not die in Holmescroft at all. She was dead when they
7955,THE HOUSE SURGEON,found her under the window in the morning. Just dead.”
7956,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7957,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Under that laburnum outside the window?” I asked, for I suddenly"
7958,THE HOUSE SURGEON,remembered the crooked evil thing.
7959,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7960,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Exactly. She broke the tree in falling. But no death has ever taken
7961,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"place in the house, so far as we were concerned. You can make yourself"
7962,THE HOUSE SURGEON,quite easy on that point. Mr. M'Leod's extra thousand for what you
7963,THE HOUSE SURGEON,called the 'clean bill of health' was something toward my cousins'
7964,THE HOUSE SURGEON,estate when we sold. It was my duty as their lawyer to get it for
7965,THE HOUSE SURGEON,them--at any cost to my own feelings.”
7966,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7967,THE HOUSE SURGEON,I know better than to argue when the English talk about their duty. So I
7968,THE HOUSE SURGEON,agreed with my solicitor.
7969,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7970,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Their sister's death must have been a great blow to your cousins,” I"
7971,THE HOUSE SURGEON,went on. The bath-chair was behind me.
7972,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7973,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Unspeakable,” Baxter whispered. “They brooded on it day and night."
7974,THE HOUSE SURGEON,No wonder. If their theory of poor Aggie making away with herself was
7975,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"correct, she was eternally lost!”"
7976,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7977,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Do you believe that she made away with herself?”
7978,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7979,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“No, thank God! Never have! And after what happened to Mary last night,"
7980,THE HOUSE SURGEON,I see perfectly what happened to poor Aggie. She had the family throat
7981,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"too. By the way, Mary thinks you are a doctor. Otherwise she wouldn't"
7982,THE HOUSE SURGEON,like your having been in her room.”
7983,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7984,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Very good. Is she convinced now about her sister's death?”
7985,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7986,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“She'd give anything to be able to believe it, but she's a hard woman,"
7987,THE HOUSE SURGEON,and brooding along certain lines makes one groovy. I have sometimes been
7988,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"afraid of her reason--on the religious side, don't you know. Elizabeth"
7989,THE HOUSE SURGEON,doesn't matter. Brain of a hen. Always had.”
7990,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7991,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Here Arthurs summoned me to the bath-chair, and the ravaged face,"
7992,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"beneath its knitted Shetland wool hood, of Miss Mary Moultrie."
7993,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7994,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I need not remind you, I hope, of the seal of secrecy--absolute"
7995,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"secrecy--in your profession,” she began. “Thanks to my cousin's and my"
7996,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"sister's stupidity, you have found out----” she blew her nose."
7997,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
7998,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Please don't excite her, sir,” said Arthurs at the back."
7999,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8000,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“But, my dear Miss Moultrie, I only know what I've seen, of course,"
8001,THE HOUSE SURGEON,but it seems to me that what you thought was a tragedy in your sister's
8002,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"case, turns out, on your own evidence, so to speak, to have been an"
8003,THE HOUSE SURGEON,accident--a dreadfully sad one--but absolutely an accident.”
8004,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8005,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Do you believe that too?” she cried. “Or are you only saying it to
8006,THE HOUSE SURGEON,comfort me?”
8007,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8008,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“I believe it from the bottom of my heart. Come down to Holmescroft for
8009,THE HOUSE SURGEON,an hour--for half an hour and satisfy yourself.”
8010,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8011,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Of what? You don't understand. I see the house every day--every night.
8012,THE HOUSE SURGEON,I am always there in spirit--waking or sleeping. I couldn't face it in
8013,THE HOUSE SURGEON,reality.”
8014,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8015,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“But you must,” I said. “If you go there in the spirit the greater need"
8016,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"for you to go there in the flesh. Go to your sister's room once more,"
8017,THE HOUSE SURGEON,and see the window--I nearly fell out of it myself. It's--it's awfully
8018,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"low and dangerous. That would convince you,” I pleaded."
8019,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8020,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Yet Aggie had slept in that room for years,” she interrupted."
8021,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8022,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You've slept in your room here for a long time, haven't you? But you"
8023,THE HOUSE SURGEON,nearly fell out of the window when you were choking.”
8024,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8025,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“That is true. That is one thing true,” she nodded. “And I might have"
8026,THE HOUSE SURGEON,been killed as--perhaps Aggie was killed.”
8027,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8028,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“In that case your own sister and cousin and maid would have said you
8029,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"had committed suicide, Miss Moultrie. Come down to Holmescroft, and go"
8030,THE HOUSE SURGEON,over the place just once.”
8031,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8032,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You are lying,” she said quite quietly. “You don't want me to come down"
8033,THE HOUSE SURGEON,to see a window. It is something else. I warn you we are Evangelicals.
8034,THE HOUSE SURGEON,We don't believe in prayers for the dead. 'As the tree falls--'”
8035,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8036,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Yes. I daresay. But you persist in thinking that your sister committed
8037,THE HOUSE SURGEON,suicide--”
8038,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8039,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“No! No! I have always prayed that I might have misjudged her.”
8040,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8041,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Arthurs at the bath-chair spoke up: “Oh, Miss Mary! you would 'ave it"
8042,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"from the first that poor Miss Aggie 'ad made away with herself; an', of"
8043,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"course, Miss Bessie took the notion from you. Only Master--Mister John"
8044,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"stood out, and--and I'd 'ave taken my Bible oath you was making away"
8045,THE HOUSE SURGEON,with yourself last night.”
8046,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8047,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Miss Mary leaned towards me, one finger on my sleeve."
8048,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8049,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“If going to Holmescroft kills me,” she said, “you will have the murder"
8050,THE HOUSE SURGEON,of a fellow-creature on your conscience for all eternity.”
8051,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8052,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I'll risk it,” I answered. Remembering what torment the mere reflection"
8053,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of her torments had cast on Holmescroft, and remembering, above all, the"
8054,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"dumb Thing that filled the house with its desire to speak, I felt that"
8055,THE HOUSE SURGEON,there might be worse things.
8056,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8057,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Baxter was amazed at the proposed visit, but at a nod from that terrible"
8058,THE HOUSE SURGEON,woman went off to make arrangements. Then I sent a telegram to M'Leod
8059,THE HOUSE SURGEON,bidding him and his vacate Holmescroft for that afternoon. Miss Mary
8060,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"should be alone with her dead, as I had been alone."
8061,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8062,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I expected untold trouble in transporting her, but to do her justice,"
8063,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"the promise given for the journey, she underwent it without murmur,"
8064,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"spasm, or unnecessary word. Miss Bessie, pressed in a corner by the"
8065,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"window, wept behind her veil, and from time to time tried to take"
8066,THE HOUSE SURGEON,hold of her sister's hand. Baxter wrapped himself in his newly found
8067,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"happiness as selfishly as a bridegroom, for he sat still and smiled."
8068,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8069,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“So long as I know that Aggie didn't make away with herself,” he"
8070,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"explained, “I tell you frankly I don't care what happened. She's as hard"
8071,THE HOUSE SURGEON,as a rock--Mary. Always was. She won't die.”
8072,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8073,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"We led her out on to the platform like a blind woman, and so got her"
8074,THE HOUSE SURGEON,into the fly. The half-hour crawl to Holmescroft was the most racking
8075,THE HOUSE SURGEON,experience of the day. M'Leod had obeyed my instructions. There was no
8076,THE HOUSE SURGEON,one visible in the house or the gardens; and the front door stood open.
8077,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8078,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Miss Mary rose from beside her sister, stepped forth first, and entered"
8079,THE HOUSE SURGEON,the hall.
8080,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8081,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Come, Bessie,” she cried."
8082,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8083,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I daren't. Oh, I daren't.”"
8084,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8085,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Come!” Her voice had altered. I felt Baxter start. “There's nothing to
8086,THE HOUSE SURGEON,be afraid of.”
8087,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8088,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Good heavens!” said Baxter. “She's running up the stairs. We'd better
8089,THE HOUSE SURGEON,follow.”
8090,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8091,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“Let's wait below. She's going to the room.”
8092,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8093,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"We heard the door of the bedroom I knew open and shut, and we waited in"
8094,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"the lemon-coloured hall, heavy with the scent of flowers."
8095,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8096,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I've never been into it since it was sold,” Baxter sighed. “What a"
8097,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"lovely, restful plate it is! Poor Aggie used to arrange the flowers.”"
8098,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8099,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Restful?” I began, but stopped of a sudden, for I felt all over my"
8100,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"bruised soul that Baxter was speaking truth. It was a light, spacious,"
8101,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"airy house, full of the sense of well-being and peace--above all things,"
8102,THE HOUSE SURGEON,of peace. I ventured into the dining-room where the thoughtful M'Leod's
8103,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"had left a small fire. There was no terror there, present or lurking;"
8104,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and in the drawing-room, which for good reasons we had never cared"
8105,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"to enter, the sun and the peace and the scent of the flowers worked"
8106,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"together as is fit in an inhabited house. When I returned to the hall,"
8107,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Baxter was sweetly asleep on a couch, looking most unlike a middle-aged"
8108,THE HOUSE SURGEON,solicitor who had spent a broken night with an exacting cousin.
8109,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8110,THE HOUSE SURGEON,There was ample time for me to review it all--to felicitate myself upon
8111,THE HOUSE SURGEON,my magnificent acumen (barring some errors about Baxter as a thief
8112,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"and possibly a murderer), before the door above opened, and Baxter,"
8113,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"evidently a light sleeper, sprang awake."
8114,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8115,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I've had a heavenly little nap,” he said, rubbing his eyes with the"
8116,THE HOUSE SURGEON,backs of his hands like a child. “Good Lord! That's not their step!”
8117,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8118,THE HOUSE SURGEON,But it was. I had never before been privileged to see the Shadow
8119,THE HOUSE SURGEON,turned backward on the dial--the years ripped bodily off poor human
8120,THE HOUSE SURGEON,shoulders--old sunken eyes filled and alight--harsh lips moistened and
8121,THE HOUSE SURGEON,human.
8122,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8123,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“John,” Miss Mary called, “I know now. Aggie didn't do it!” and “She"
8124,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"didn't do it!” echoed Miss Mary, and giggled."
8125,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8126,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I did not think it wrong to say a prayer,” Miss Mary continued. “Not"
8127,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"for her soul, but for our peace. Then I was convinced.”"
8128,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8129,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Then we got conviction,” the younger sister piped."
8130,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8131,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“We've misjudged poor Aggie, John. But I feel she knows now. Wherever"
8132,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"she is, she knows that we know she is guiltless.”"
8133,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8134,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Yes, she knows. I felt it too,” said Miss Elizabeth."
8135,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8136,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I never doubted,” said John Baxter, whose face was beautiful at that"
8137,THE HOUSE SURGEON,hour. “Not from the first. Never have!”
8138,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8139,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“You never offered me proof, John. Now, thank God, it will not be the"
8140,THE HOUSE SURGEON,same any more. I can think henceforward of Aggie without sorrow.” She
8141,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"tripped, absolutely tripped, across the hall. “What ideas these Jews"
8142,THE HOUSE SURGEON,have of arranging furniture!” She spied me behind a big Cloisonnée vase.
8143,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8144,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I've seen the window,” she said remotely. “You took a great risk in"
8145,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"advising me to undertake such a journey. However, as it turns out..."
8146,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I forgive you, and I pray you may never know what mental anguish means!"
8147,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Bessie! Look at this peculiar piano! Do you suppose, Doctor, these"
8148,THE HOUSE SURGEON,people would offer one tea? I miss mine.”
8149,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8150,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I will go and see,” I said, and explored M'Leod's new-built servants'"
8151,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"wing. It was in the servants' hall that I unearthed the M'Leod family,"
8152,THE HOUSE SURGEON,bursting with anxiety.
8153,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8154,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Tea for three, quick,” I said. “If you ask me any questions now,"
8155,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"I shall have a fit!” So Mrs. M'Leod got it, and I was butler, amid"
8156,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"murmured apologies from Baxter, still smiling and self-absorbed, and"
8157,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"the cold disapproval of Miss Mary, who thought the pattern of the china"
8158,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"vulgar. However, she ate well, and even asked me whether I would not"
8159,THE HOUSE SURGEON,like a cup of tea for myself.
8160,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8161,THE HOUSE SURGEON,They went away in the twilight--the twilight that I had once feared.
8162,THE HOUSE SURGEON,They were going to an hotel in London to rest after the fatigues of the
8163,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"day, and as their fly turned down the drive, I capered on the door step,"
8164,THE HOUSE SURGEON,with the all-darkened house behind me.
8165,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8166,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Then I heard the uncertain feet of the M'Leods and bade them not to turn
8167,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"on the lights, but to feel--to feel what I had done; for the Shadow was"
8168,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"gone, with the dumb desire in the air. They drew short, but afterwards"
8169,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"deeper, breaths, like bathers entering chill water, separated one from"
8170,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"the other, moved about the hall, tiptoed upstairs, raced down, and then"
8171,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Miss M'Leod, and I believe her mother, though she denies this, embraced"
8172,THE HOUSE SURGEON,me. I know M'Leod did.
8173,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8174,THE HOUSE SURGEON,It was a disgraceful evening. To say we rioted through the house is to
8175,THE HOUSE SURGEON,put it mildly. We played a sort of Blind Man's Buff along the darkest
8176,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"passages, in the unlighted drawing-room, and little dining-room, calling"
8177,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"cheerily to each other after each exploration that here, and here, and"
8178,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"here, the trouble had removed itself. We came up to the bedroom--mine"
8179,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"for the night again--and sat, the women on the bed, and we men"
8180,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"on chairs, drinking in blessed draughts of peace and comfort and"
8181,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"cleanliness of soul, while I told them my tale in full, and received"
8182,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"fresh praise, thanks, and blessings."
8183,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8184,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"When the servants, returned from their day's outing, gave us a supper"
8185,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"of cold fried fish, M'Leod had sense enough to open no wine. We had"
8186,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"been practically drunk since nightfall, and grew incoherent on water and"
8187,THE HOUSE SURGEON,milk.
8188,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8189,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I like that Baxter,” said M'Leod. “He's a sharp man. The death wasn't"
8190,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"in the house, but he ran it pretty close, ain't it?”"
8191,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8192,THE HOUSE SURGEON,“And the joke of it is that he supposes I want to buy the place from
8193,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"you,” I said. “Are you selling?”"
8194,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8195,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Not for twice what I paid for it--now,” said M'Leod. “I'll keep you in"
8196,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"furs all your life, but not our Holmescroft.”"
8197,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8198,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“No--never our Holmescroft,” said Miss M'Leod. “We'll ask him here on"
8199,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Tuesday, mamma.” They squeezed each other's hands."
8200,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8201,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Now tell me,” said Mrs. M'Leod--“that tall one, I saw out of the"
8202,THE HOUSE SURGEON,scullery window--did she tell you she was always here in the spirit? I
8203,THE HOUSE SURGEON,hate her. She made all this trouble. It was not her house after she had
8204,THE HOUSE SURGEON,sold it. What do you think?”
8205,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8206,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I suppose,” I answered, “she brooded over what she believed was her"
8207,THE HOUSE SURGEON,sister's suicide night and day--she confessed she did--and her thoughts
8208,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"being concentrated on this place, they felt like a--like a burning"
8209,THE HOUSE SURGEON,glass.”
8210,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8211,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Burning glass is good,” said M'Leod."
8212,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8213,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I said it was like a light of blackness turned on us,” cried the girl,"
8214,THE HOUSE SURGEON,twiddling her ring. “That must have been when the tall one thought worst
8215,THE HOUSE SURGEON,about her sister and the house.”
8216,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8217,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Ah, the poor Aggie!” said Mrs. M'Leod. “The poor Aggie, trying to"
8218,THE HOUSE SURGEON,tell every one it was not so! No wonder we felt Something wished to say
8219,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Something. Thea, Max, do you remember that night?”"
8220,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8221,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“We need not remember any more,” M'Leod interrupted. “It is not our"
8222,THE HOUSE SURGEON,trouble. They have told each other now.”
8223,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8224,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Do you think, then,” said Miss M'Leod, “that those two, the living"
8225,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"ones, were actually told something--upstairs--in your in the room?”"
8226,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8227,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“I can't say. At any rate they were made happy, and they ate a big tea"
8228,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"afterwards. As your father says, it is not our trouble any longer--thank"
8229,THE HOUSE SURGEON,God!”
8230,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8231,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"“Amen!” said M'Leod. “Now, Thea, let us have some music after all these"
8232,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"months. 'With mirth, thou pretty bird,' ain't it? You ought to hear"
8233,THE HOUSE SURGEON,that.”
8234,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8235,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"And in the half-lighted hall, Thea sang an old English song that I had"
8236,THE HOUSE SURGEON,never heard before.
8237,THE HOUSE SURGEON,
8238,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"With mirth, thou pretty bird, rejoice"
8239,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Thy Maker's praise enhanced;
8240,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Lift up thy shrill and pleasant voice,"
8241,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Thy God is high advanced!
8242,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Thy food before He did provide,"
8243,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"And gives it in a fitting side,"
8244,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Wherewith be thou sufficed!
8245,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Why shouldst thou now unpleasant be,"
8246,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Thy wrath against God venting,"
8247,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"That He a little bird made thee,"
8248,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Thy silly head tormenting,"
8249,THE HOUSE SURGEON,Because He made thee not a man?
8250,THE HOUSE SURGEON,"Oh, Peace! He hath well thought thereon,"
