18,LAST POEMS,"I publish these poems, few though they are, because it is not likely"
19,LAST POEMS,that I shall ever be impelled to write much more.  I can no longer
20,LAST POEMS,expect to be revisited by the continuous excitement under which in
21,LAST POEMS,"the early months of 1895 I wrote the greater part of my first book,"
22,LAST POEMS,nor indeed could I well sustain it if  it came; and it is best that what
23,LAST POEMS,I have written should be printed while I am here to see it through
24,LAST POEMS,the press and control its spelling and punctuation.  About a quarter
25,LAST POEMS,"of this matter belongs to the April of the present year, but most of"
26,LAST POEMS,it to dates between 1895 and 1910.

36,LAST POEMS,That once the Muses wore;
37,LAST POEMS,The year draws in the day
38,LAST POEMS,And soon will evening shut:
39,LAST POEMS,"The laurels all are cut,"
40,LAST POEMS,We'll to the woods no more.
41,LAST POEMS,"Oh we'll no more, no more"
42,LAST POEMS,"To the leafy woods away,"
43,LAST POEMS,To the high wild woods of laurel
44,LAST POEMS,And the bowers of bay no more.

50,I. THE WEST,I. THE WEST
51,I. THE WEST,
52,I. THE WEST,
53,I. THE WEST,Beyond the moor and the mountain crest
54,I. THE WEST,"--Comrade, look not on the west--"
55,I. THE WEST,The sun is down and drinks away
56,I. THE WEST,From air and land the lees of day.
57,I. THE WEST,
58,I. THE WEST,The long cloud and the single pine
59,I. THE WEST,"Sentinel the ending line,"
60,I. THE WEST,"And out beyond it, clear and wan,"
61,I. THE WEST,Reach the gulfs of evening on.
62,I. THE WEST,
63,I. THE WEST,The son of woman turns his brow
64,I. THE WEST,"West from forty countries now,"
65,I. THE WEST,"And, as the edge of heaven he eyes,"
66,I. THE WEST,"Thinks eternal thoughts, and sighs."
67,I. THE WEST,
68,I. THE WEST,"Oh wide's the world, to rest or roam,"
69,I. THE WEST,"With change abroad and cheer at home,"
70,I. THE WEST,"Fights and furloughs, talk and tale,"
71,I. THE WEST,Company and beef and ale.
72,I. THE WEST,
73,I. THE WEST,But if I front the evening sky
74,I. THE WEST,"Silent on the west look I,"
75,I. THE WEST,"And my comrade, stride for stride,"
76,I. THE WEST,"Paces silent at my side,"
77,I. THE WEST,
78,I. THE WEST,"Comrade, look not on the west:"
79,I. THE WEST,'Twill have the heart out of your breast;
80,I. THE WEST,"'Twill take your thoughts and sink them far,"
81,I. THE WEST,Leagues beyond the sunset bar.
82,I. THE WEST,
83,I. THE WEST,"Oh lad, I fear that yon's the sea"
84,I. THE WEST,"Where they fished for you and me,"
85,I. THE WEST,"And there, from whence we both were ta'en,"
86,I. THE WEST,You and I shall drown again.
87,I. THE WEST,
88,I. THE WEST,Send not on your soul before
89,I. THE WEST,"To dive from that beguiling shore,"
90,I. THE WEST,And let not yet the swimmer leave
91,I. THE WEST,His clothes upon the sands of eve.
92,I. THE WEST,
93,I. THE WEST,Too fast to yonder strand forlorn
94,I. THE WEST,"We journey, to the sunken bourn,"
95,I. THE WEST,To flush the fading tinges eyed
96,I. THE WEST,By other lads at eventide.
97,I. THE WEST,
98,I. THE WEST,"Wide is the world, to rest or roam,"
99,I. THE WEST,And early 'tis for turning home:
100,I. THE WEST,"Plant your heel on earth and stand,"
101,I. THE WEST,And let's forget our native land.
102,I. THE WEST,
103,I. THE WEST,When you and I are split on air
104,I. THE WEST,Long we shall be strangers there;
105,I. THE WEST,Friends of flesh and bone are best;
106,I. THE WEST,"Comrade, look not on the west."
107,I. THE WEST,
108,I. THE WEST,

113,II.,
114,II.,
115,II.,As I gird on for fighting
116,II.,"My sword upon my thigh,"
117,II.,I think on old ill fortunes
118,II.,Of better men than I.
119,II.,
120,II.,"Think I, the round world over,"
121,II.,What golden lads are low
122,II.,With hurts not mine to mourn for
123,II.,And shames I shall not know.
124,II.,
125,II.,What evil luck soever
126,II.,"For me remains in store,"
127,II.,'Tis sure much finer fellows
128,II.,Have fared much worse before.
129,II.,
130,II.,So here are things to think on
131,II.,"That ought to make me brave,"
132,II.,As I strap on for fighting
133,II.,My sword that will not save.

140,III.,
141,III.,
142,III.,"Her strong enchantments failing,"
143,III.,"Her towers of fear in wreck,"
144,III.,Her limbecks dried of poisons
145,III.,"And the knife at her neck,"
146,III.,
147,III.,The Queen of air and darkness
148,III.,"Begins to shrill and cry,"
149,III.,"'O young man, O my slayer,"
150,III.,To-morrow you shall die.'
151,III.,
152,III.,"O Queen of air and darkness,"
153,III.,"I think 'tis truth you say,"
154,III.,And I shall die to-morrow;
155,III.,But you will die to-day.

164,IV. ILLIC JACET,"Oh hard is the bed they have made him,"
165,IV. ILLIC JACET,And common the blanket and cheap;
166,IV. ILLIC JACET,But there he will lie as they laid him:
167,IV. ILLIC JACET,Where else could you trust him to sleep?
168,IV. ILLIC JACET,
169,IV. ILLIC JACET,To sleep when the bugle is crying
170,IV. ILLIC JACET,"And cravens have heard and are brave,"
171,IV. ILLIC JACET,When mothers and sweethearts are sighing
172,IV. ILLIC JACET,And lads are in love with the grave.
173,IV. ILLIC JACET,
174,IV. ILLIC JACET,"Oh dark is the chamber and lonely,"
175,IV. ILLIC JACET,And lights and companions depart;
176,IV. ILLIC JACET,But lief will he lose them and only
177,IV. ILLIC JACET,Behold the desire of his heart.
178,IV. ILLIC JACET,
179,IV. ILLIC JACET,"And low is the roof, but it covers"
180,IV. ILLIC JACET,A sleeper content to repose;
181,IV. ILLIC JACET,And far from his friends and his lovers
182,IV. ILLIC JACET,He lies with the sweetheart he chose.

193,V. GRENADIER,"'Young man, a soldier will you be"
194,V. GRENADIER,For thirteen pence a day?'
195,V. GRENADIER,
196,V. GRENADIER,For thirteen pence a day did I
197,V. GRENADIER,"Take off the things I wore,"
198,V. GRENADIER,"And I have marched to where I lie,"
199,V. GRENADIER,And I shall march no more.
200,V. GRENADIER,
201,V. GRENADIER,"My mouth is dry, my shirt is wet,"
202,V. GRENADIER,"My blood runs all away,"
203,V. GRENADIER,So now I shall not die in debt
204,V. GRENADIER,For thirteen pence a day.

206,V. GRENADIER,To-morrow after new young men
207,V. GRENADIER,"The sergeant he must see,"
208,V. GRENADIER,For things will all be over then
209,V. GRENADIER,Between the Queen and me.
210,V. GRENADIER,
211,V. GRENADIER,"And I shall have to bate my price,"
212,V. GRENADIER,"For in the grave, they say,"
213,V. GRENADIER,Is neither knowledge nor device

223,VI. LANCER,"I 'listed at home for a lancer,"
224,VI. LANCER,Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
225,VI. LANCER,I 'listed at home for a lancer
226,VI. LANCER,To ride on a horse to my grave.
227,VI. LANCER,
228,VI. LANCER,And over the seas we were bidden
229,VI. LANCER,A country to take and to keep;
230,VI. LANCER,"And far with the brave I have ridden,"
231,VI. LANCER,And now with the brave I shall sleep.
232,VI. LANCER,
233,VI. LANCER,For round me the men will be lying
234,VI. LANCER,That learned me the way to behave.
235,VI. LANCER,And showed me my business of dying:
236,VI. LANCER,Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
237,VI. LANCER,
238,VI. LANCER,They ask and there is not an answer;
239,VI. LANCER,"Says I, I will 'list for a lancer,"
240,VI. LANCER,Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
241,VI. LANCER,
242,VI. LANCER,And I with the brave shall be sleeping
243,VI. LANCER,"At ease on my mattress of loam,"
244,VI. LANCER,When back from their taking and keeping
245,VI. LANCER,The squadron is riding home.
246,VI. LANCER,
247,VI. LANCER,"The wind with the plumes will be playing,"
248,VI. LANCER,"The girls will stand watching them wave,"
249,VI. LANCER,And eyeing my comrades and saying
250,VI. LANCER,Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
251,VI. LANCER,
252,VI. LANCER,They ask and there is not an answer;

261,VII.,
262,VII.,
263,VII.,In valleys green and still
264,VII.,Where lovers wander maying
265,VII.,They hear from over hill
266,VII.,A music playing.
267,VII.,
268,VII.,"Behind the drum and fife,"
269,VII.,"Past hawthornwood and hollow,"
270,VII.,Through earth and out of life
271,VII.,The soldiers follow.
272,VII.,
273,VII.,The soldier's is the trade:
274,VII.,In any wind or weather
275,VII.,He steals the heart of maid
276,VII.,And man together.
277,VII.,
278,VII.,The lover and his lass
279,VII.,Beneath the hawthorn lying
280,VII.,"Have heard the soldiers pass,"
281,VII.,And both are sighing.
282,VII.,
283,VII.,And down the distance they
284,VII.,With dying note and swelling
285,VII.,Walk the resounding way
286,VII.,To the still dwelling.

299,VIII.,
300,VIII.,"Peace is come and wars are over,"
301,VIII.,"Welcome you and welcome all,"
302,VIII.,While the charger crops the clover
303,VIII.,And his bridle hangs in stall.
304,VIII.,
305,VIII.,"Now no more of winters biting,"
306,VIII.,"Filth in trench from fall to spring,"
307,VIII.,Summers full of sweat and fighting
308,VIII.,For the Kesar or the King.
309,VIII.,
310,VIII.,"Rest you, charger, rust you, bridle;"

326,IX.,
327,IX.,"There's one spoilt spring to scant our mortal lot,"
328,IX.,One season ruined of our little store.
329,IX.,May will be fine next year as like as not:
330,IX.,"Oh ay, but then we shall be twenty-four."
331,IX.,
332,IX.,We for a certainty are not the first
333,IX.,Have sat in taverns while the tempest hurled
334,IX.,"Their hopeful plans to emptiness, and cursed"
335,IX.,Whatever brute and blackguard made the world.
336,IX.,
337,IX.,It is in truth iniquity on high
338,IX.,"To cheat our sentenced souls of aught they crave,"
339,IX.,And mar the merriment as you and I
340,IX.,Fare on our long fool's-errand to the grave.
341,IX.,
342,IX.,Iniquity it is; but pass the can.
343,IX.,"My lad, no pair of kings our mothers bore;"
344,IX.,Our only portion is the estate of man:
345,IX.,"We want the moon, but we shall get no more."
346,IX.,
347,IX.,If here to-day the cloud of thunder lours
348,IX.,To-morrow it will hie on far behests;
349,IX.,The flesh will grieve on other bones than ours
350,IX.,"Soon, and the soul will mourn in other breasts."
351,IX.,
352,IX.,The troubles of our proud and angry dust

366,X.,Lief should I rouse at morning
367,X.,And lief lie down of nights.
368,X.,
369,X.,But men at whiles are sober
370,X.,"And think by fits and starts,"

383,XI.,To wash and dress and eat and drink
384,XI.,And look at things and talk and think
385,XI.,"And work, and God knows why."
386,XI.,
387,XI.,Oh often have I washed and dressed
388,XI.,And what's to show for all my pain?

404,XII.,And if my ways are not as theirs
405,XII.,Let them mind their own affairs.
406,XII.,"Their deeds I judge and much condemn,"
407,XII.,Yet when did I make laws for them?
408,XII.,"Please yourselves, say I, and they"
409,XII.,Need only look the other way.
410,XII.,"But no, they will not; they must still"
411,XII.,"Wrest their neighbour to their will,"
412,XII.,And make me dance as they desire
413,XII.,With jail and gallows and hell-fire.
414,XII.,And how am I to face the odds
415,XII.,Of man's bedevilment and God's?
416,XII.,"I, a stranger and afraid"

1001,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,From the drawbridge Death and Sin
1002,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Rose to render key and sword
1003,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,To their father and their lord.
1004,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,And the portress foul to see
1005,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Lifted up her eyes on me
1006,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Smiling, and I made reply:"
1007,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"""Met again, my lass,"" said I."
1008,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Then the sentry turned his head,"
1009,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Looked, and knew me, and was Ned."
1010,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,
1011,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Once he looked, and halted straight,"
1012,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Set his back against the gate,"
1013,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Caught his musket to his chin,"
1014,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,While the hive of hell within
1015,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Sent abroad a seething hum
1016,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,As of towns whose king is come
1017,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Leading conquest home from far
1018,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"And the captives of his war,"
1019,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"And the car of triumph waits,"
1020,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,And they open wide the gates.
1021,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,But across the entry barred
1022,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Straddled the revolted guard,"
1023,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Weaponed and accoutred well
1024,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,From the arsenals of hell;
1025,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"And beside him, sick and white,"
1026,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Sin to left and Death to right
1027,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Turned a countenance of fear
1028,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,On the flaming mutineer.
1029,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Over us the darkness bowed,"
1030,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,And the anger in the cloud
1031,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Clenched the lightning for the stroke;
1032,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,But the traitor musket spoke.
1033,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,
1034,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,And the hollowness of hell
1035,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Sounded as its master fell,"
1036,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,And the mourning echo rolled
1037,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Ruin through his kingdom old.
1038,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Tyranny and terror flown
1039,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Left a pair of friends alone,"
1040,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,And beneath the nether sky
1041,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,All that stirred was he and I.
1042,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,
1043,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Silent, nothing found to say,"
1044,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,We began the backward way;
1045,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,And the ebbing luster died
1046,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"From the soldier at my side,"
1047,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,As in all his spruce attire
1048,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Failed the everlasting fire.
1049,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Midmost of the homeward track
1050,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,Once we listened and looked back;
1051,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"But the city, dusk and mute,"
1052,XXXI. HELL'S GATE,"Slept, and there was no pursuit."
