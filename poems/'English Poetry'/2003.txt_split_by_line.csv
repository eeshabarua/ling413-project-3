32,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Historical Background
33,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
34,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Published under the pseudonym, Clive Hamilton, Spirits in Bondage was C."
35,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"S. Lewis' first book. Released in 1919 by Heinemann, it was reprinted in"
36,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,1984 by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and included in Lewis' 1994 Collected
37,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Poems. It is the first of Lewis' major published works to enter the
38,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,public domain in the United States. Readers should be aware that in
39,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,other countries it may still be under copyright protection.
40,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
41,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Most of the poems appear to have been written between 1915 and 1918, a"
42,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"period during which Lewis was a student under W. T. Kirkpatrick, a"
43,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"military trainee at Oxford, and a soldier serving in the trenches of"
44,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,World War I. Their outlook varies from Romantic expressions of love for
45,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,the beauty and simplicity of nature to cynical statements about the
46,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"presence of evil in this world. In a September 12, 1918 letter to his"
47,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"friend Arthur Greeves, Lewis said that his book was, ""mainly strung"
48,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,around the idea that I mentioned to you before--that nature is wholly
49,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"diabolical & malevolent and that God, if he exists, is outside of and in"
50,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"opposition to the cosmic arrangements."" In his cynical poems, Lewis is"
51,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,dealing with the same questions about evil in nature that Alfred Lord
52,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Tennyson explored from a position of troubled faith in ""In Memoriam A."
53,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"H."" (Stanzas 54f). In a letter written perhaps to reassure his father,"
54,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Lewis claimed, ""You know who the God I blaspheme is and that it is not"
55,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"the God that you or I worship, or any other Christian."""
56,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
57,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Whatever Lewis believed at that time, the attitude in many of these"
58,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,poems is quite different from the attitude he expressed in his many
59,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Christian books from the 1930s on. Attempts in movies and on stage plays
60,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,to portray Lewis as a sheltered professor who knew little about pain
61,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"until the death of his wife late in life, have to deal not only with the"
62,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"many tragedies he experienced from a boy on, but also with the"
63,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,disturbing issues he faced in many of these early poems.

68,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Prologue
69,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
70,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"As of old Phoenician men, to the Tin Isles sailing"
71,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Straight against the sunset and the edges of the earth,"
72,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Chaunted loud above the storm and the strange sea's wailing,"
73,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Legends of their people and the land that gave them birth--
74,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Sang aloud to Baal-Peor, sang unto the horned maiden,"
75,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Sang how they should come again with the Brethon treasure laden,"
76,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Sang of all the pride and glory of their hardy enterprise,"
77,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"How they found the outer islands, where the unknown stars arise;"
78,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the rowers down below, rowing hard as they could row,"
79,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Toiling at the stroke and feather through the wet and weary weather,"
80,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Even they forgot their burden in the measure of a song,"
81,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the merchants and the masters and the bondsmen all together,"
82,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Dreaming of the wondrous islands, brought the gallant ship along;"
83,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,So in mighty deeps alone on the chainless breezes blown
84,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"In my coracle of verses I will sing of lands unknown,"
85,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Flying from the scarlet city where a Lord that knows no pity,"
86,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Mocks the broken people praying round his iron throne,"
87,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Sing about the Hidden Country fresh and full of quiet green.
88,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Sailing over seas uncharted to a port that none has seen.

99,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
100,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I am Nature, the Mighty Mother,"
101,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I am the law: ye have none other.
102,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
103,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I am the flower and the dewdrop fresh,"
104,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I am the lust in your itching flesh.
105,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
106,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I am the battle's filth and strain,"
107,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I am the widow's empty pain.
108,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
109,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I am the sea to smother your breath,"
110,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I am the bomb, the falling death."
111,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
112,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I am the fact and the crushing reason
113,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To thwart your fantasy's new-born treason.
114,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
115,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I am the spider making her net,"
116,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I am the beast with jaws blood-wet.
117,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
118,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I am a wolf that follows the sun
119,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And I will catch him ere day be done.

124,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,II. French Nocturne (Monchy-Le-Preux)
125,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
126,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Long leagues on either hand the trenches spread
127,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And all is still; now even this gross line
128,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Drinks in the frosty silences divine
129,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The pale, green moon is riding overhead."
130,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
131,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The jaws of a sacked village, stark and grim;"
132,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Out on the ridge have swallowed up the sun,"
133,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And in one angry streak his blood has run
134,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To left and right along the horizon dim.
135,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
136,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"There comes a buzzing plane: and now, it seems"
137,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Flies straight into the moon. Lo! where he steers
138,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Across the pallid globe and surely nears
139,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,In that white land some harbour of dear dreams!
140,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
141,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"False mocking fancy! Once I too could dream,"
142,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Who now can only see with vulgar eye
143,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That he's no nearer to the moon than I
144,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And she's a stone that catches the sun's beam.
145,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
146,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,What call have I to dream of anything?
147,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I am a wolf. Back to the world again,"
148,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And speech of fellow-brutes that once were men
149,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Our throats can bark for slaughter: cannot sing.
150,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
151,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
152,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
153,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
154,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,III. The Satyr
155,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
156,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,When the flowery hands of spring
157,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Forth their woodland riches fling,"
158,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Through the meadows, through the valleys"
159,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Goes the satyr carolling.
160,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
161,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"From the mountain and the moor,"
162,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Forest green and ocean shore
163,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,All the faerie kin he rallies
164,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Making music evermore.
165,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
166,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,See! the shaggy pelt doth grow
167,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"On his twisted shanks below,"
168,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And his dreadful feet are cloven
169,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Though his brow be white as snow--
170,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
171,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Though his brow be clear and white
172,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And beneath it fancies bright,"
173,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Wisdom and high thoughts are woven
174,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the musics of delight,"
175,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
176,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Though his temples too be fair
177,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Yet two horns are growing there
178,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Bursting forth to part asunder
179,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,All the riches of his hair.
180,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
181,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Faerie maidens he may meet
182,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Fly the horns and cloven feet,"
183,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But, his sad brown eyes with wonder"
184,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Seeing-stay from their retreat.
185,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
186,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
187,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
188,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
189,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,IV. Victory
190,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
191,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Roland is dead, Cuchulain's crest is low,"
192,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The battered war-rear wastes and turns to rust,"
193,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And Helen's eyes and Iseult's lips are dust
194,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And dust the shoulders and the breasts of snow.
195,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
196,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The faerie people from our woods are gone,"
197,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"No Dryads have I found in all our trees,"
198,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,No Triton blows his horn about our seas
199,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And Arthur sleeps far hence in Avalon.
200,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
201,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The ancient songs they wither as the grass
202,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And waste as doth a garment waxen old,"
203,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,All poets have been fools who thought to mould
204,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,A monument more durable than brass.
205,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
206,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,For these decay: but not for that decays
207,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The yearning, high, rebellious spirit of man"
208,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That never rested yet since life began
209,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,From striving with red Nature and her ways.
210,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
211,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Now in the filth of war, the baresark shout"
212,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of battle, it is vexed. And yet so oft"
213,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Out of the deeps, of old, it rose aloft"
214,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That they who watch the ages may not doubt.
215,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
216,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Though often bruised, oft broken by the rod,"
217,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yet, like the phoenix, from each fiery bed"
218,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Higher the stricken spirit lifts its head
219,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And higher-till the beast become a god.

223,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
224,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,V. Irish Nocturne
225,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
226,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Now the grey mist comes creeping up
227,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,From the waste ocean's weedy strand
228,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And fills the valley, as a cup"
229,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,If filled of evil drink in a wizard's hand;
230,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the trees fade out of sight,"
231,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Like dreary ghosts unhealthily,"
232,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Into the damp, pale night,"
233,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Till you almost think that a clearer eye could see
234,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Some shape come up of a demon seeking apart
235,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"His meat, as Grendel sought in Harte"
236,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The thanes that sat by the wintry log--
237,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Grendel or the shadowy mass
238,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of Balor, or the man with the face of clay,"
239,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The grey, grey walker who used to pass"
240,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Over the rock-arch nightly to his prey.
241,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But here at the dumb, slow stream where the willows hang,"
242,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"With never a wind to blow the mists apart,"
243,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Bitter and bitter it is for thee. O my heart,"
244,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Looking upon this land, where poets sang,"
245,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Thus with the dreary shroud
246,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Unwholesome, over it spread,"
247,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And knowing the fog and the cloud
248,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,In her people's heart and head
249,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Even as it lies for ever upon her coasts
250,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Making them dim and dreamy lest her sons should ever arise
251,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And remember all their boasts;
252,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,For I know that the colourless skies
253,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And the blurred horizons breed
254,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Lonely desire and many words and brooding and never a deed.
255,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
256,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
257,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
258,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
259,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,VI. Spooks
260,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
261,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Last night I dreamed that I was come again
262,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Unto the house where my beloved dwells
263,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,After long years of wandering and pain.
264,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
265,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And I stood out beneath the drenching rain
266,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And all the street was bare, and black with night,"
267,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,But in my true love's house was warmth and light.
268,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
269,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yet I could not draw near nor enter in,"
270,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And long I wondered if some secret sin
271,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Or old, unhappy anger held me fast;"
272,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
273,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Till suddenly it came into my head
274,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That I was killed long since and lying dead--
275,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Only a homeless wraith that way had passed.
276,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
277,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,So thus I found my true love's house again
278,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And stood unseen amid the winter night
279,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the lamp burned within, a rosy light,"
280,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And the wet street was shining in the rain.
281,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,

283,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
284,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
285,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,VII. Apology
286,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
287,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"If men should ask, Despoina, why I tell"
288,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Of nothing glad nor noble in my verse
289,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To lighten hearts beneath this present curse
290,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And build a heaven of dreams in real hell,"
291,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
292,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Go you to them and speak among them thus:
293,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""There were no greater grief than to recall,"
294,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Down in the rotting grave where the lithe worms crawl,"
295,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Green fields above that smiled so sweet to us."""
296,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
297,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Is it good to tell old tales of Troynovant
298,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Or praises of dead heroes, tried and sage,"
299,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Or sing the queens of unforgotten age,"
300,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Brynhild and Maeve and virgin Bradamant?
301,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
302,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,How should I sing of them? Can it be good
303,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"To think of glory now, when all is done,"
304,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And all our labour underneath the sun
305,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Has brought us this-and not the thing we would?
306,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
307,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"All these were rosy visions of the night,"
308,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The loveliness and wisdom feigned of old.
309,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But now we wake. The East is pale and cold,"
310,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"No hope is in the dawn, and no delight."
311,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
312,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
313,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
314,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
315,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,VIII. Ode for New Year's Day
316,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
317,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Woe unto you, ye sons of pain that are this day in earth,"
318,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Now cry for all your torment: now curse your hour of birth
319,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And the fathers who begat you to a portion nothing worth.
320,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And Thou, my own beloved, for as brave as ere thou art,"
321,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Bow down thine head, Despoina, clasp thy pale arms over it,"
322,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Lie low with fast-closed eyelids, clenched teeth, enduring heart,"
323,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,For sorrow on sorrow is coming wherein all flesh has part.
324,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The sky above is sickening, the clouds of God's hate cover it,"
325,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Body and soul shall suffer beyond all word or thought,"
326,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Till the pain and noisy terror that these first years have wrought
327,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Seem but the soft arising and prelude of the storm
328,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That fiercer still and heavier with sharper lightnings fraught
329,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Shall pour red wrath upon us over a world deform.
330,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
331,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Thrice happy, O Despoina, were the men who were alive"
332,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,In the great age and the golden age when still the cycle ran
333,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"On upward curve and easily, for them both maid and man"
334,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And beast and tree and spirit in the green earth could thrive.
335,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But now one age is ending, and God calls home the stars"
336,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And looses the wheel of the ages and sends it spinning back
337,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Amid the death of nations, and points a downward track,"
338,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And madness is come over us and great and little wars.
339,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"He has not left one valley, one isle of fresh and green"
340,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Where old friends could forgather amid the howling wreck.
341,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"It's vainly we are praying. We cannot, cannot check"
342,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The Power who slays and puts aside the beauty that has been.
343,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
344,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"It's truth they tell, Despoina, none hears the heart's complaining"
345,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For Nature will not pity, nor the red God lend an ear,"
346,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Yet I too have been mad in the hour of bitter paining
347,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And lifted up my voice to God, thinking that he could hear"
348,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The curse wherewith I cursed Him because the Good was dead.
349,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But lo! I am grown wiser, knowing that our own hearts"
350,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Have made a phantom called the Good, while a few years have sped"
351,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Over a little planet. And what should the great Lord know of it
352,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Who tosses the dust of chaos and gives the suns their parts?
353,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Hither and thither he moves them; for an hour we see the show of it:
354,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Only a little hour, and the life of the race is done."
355,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And here he builds a nebula, and there he slays a sun"
356,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And works his own fierce pleasure. All things he shall fulfill,"
357,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And O, my poor Despoina, do you think he ever hears"
358,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The wail of hearts he has broken, the sound of human ill?"
359,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"He cares not for our virtues, our little hopes and fears,"
360,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And how could it all go on, love, if he knew of laughter and tears?"
361,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
362,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Ah, sweet, if a man could cheat him! If you could flee away"
363,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Into some other country beyond the rosy West,"
364,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To hide in the deep forests and be for ever at rest
365,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,From the rankling hate of God and the outworn world's decay!
366,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
367,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
368,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
369,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
370,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,IX. Night
371,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
372,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"After the fret and failure of this day,"
373,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And weariness of thought, O Mother Night,"
374,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Come with soft kiss to soothe our care away
375,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And all our little tumults set to right;
376,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Most pitiful of all death's kindred fair,"
377,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Riding above us through the curtained air
378,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"On thy dusk car, thou scatterest to the earth"
379,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Sweet dreams and drowsy charms of tender might
380,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And lovers' dear delight before to-morrow's birth.
381,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Thus art thou wont thy quiet lands to leave
382,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And pillared courts beyond the Milky Way,"
383,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Wherein thou tarriest all our solar day
384,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,While unsubstantial dreams before thee weave
385,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"A foamy dance, and fluttering fancies play"
386,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,About thy palace in the silver ray
387,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of some far, moony globe. But when the hour,"
388,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The long-expected comes, the ivory gates"
389,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Open on noiseless hinge before thy bower
390,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Unbidden, and the jewelled chariot waits"
391,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With magic steeds. Thou from the fronting rim
392,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Bending to urge them, whilst thy sea-dark hair"
393,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Falls in ambrosial ripples o'er each limb,"
394,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"With beautiful pale arms, untrammelled, bare"
395,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For horsemanship, to those twin chargers fleet"
396,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Dost give full rein across the fires that glow
397,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"In the wide floor of heaven, from off their feet"
398,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Scattering the powdery star-dust as they go.
399,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Come swiftly down the sky, O Lady Night,"
400,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Fall through the shadow-country, O most kind,"
401,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Shake out thy strands of gentle dreams and light
402,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For chains, wherewith thou still art used to bind"
403,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With tenderest love of careful leeches' art

411,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
412,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I will find out a place for thee, O Sleep--"
413,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"A hidden wood among the hill-tops green,"
414,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Full of soft streams and little winds that creep
415,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The murmuring boughs between.
416,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
417,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,A hollow cup above the ocean placed
418,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Where nothing rough, nor loud, nor harsh shall be,"
419,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,But woodland light and shadow interlaced
420,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And summer sky and sea.
421,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
422,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,There in the fragrant twilight I will raise
423,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"A secret altar of the rich sea sod,"
424,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Whereat to offer sacrifice and praise
425,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Unto my lonely god:
426,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
427,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Due sacrifice of his own drowsy flowers,"
428,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The deadening poppies in an ocean shell
429,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Round which through all forgotten days and hours
430,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The great seas wove their spell.
431,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
432,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,So may he send me dreams of dear delight
433,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And draughts of cool oblivion, quenching pain,"
434,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And sweet, half-wakeful moments in the night"
435,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To hear the falling rain.
436,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
437,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And when he meets me at the dusk of day
438,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"To call me home for ever, this I ask--"
439,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That he may lead me friendly on that way
440,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And wear no frightful mask.

446,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
447,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I cried out for the pain of man,"
448,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I cried out for my bitter wrath
449,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Against the hopeless life that ran
450,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,For ever in a circling path
451,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,From death to death since all began;
452,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Till on a summer night
453,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I lost my way in the pale starlight
454,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And saw our planet, far and small,"
455,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Through endless depths of nothing fall
456,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"A lonely pin-prick spark of light,"
457,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Upon the wide, enfolding night,"
458,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"With leagues on leagues of stars above it,"
459,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And powdered dust of stars below--
460,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Dead things that neither hate nor love it
461,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Not even their own loveliness can know,"
462,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Being but cosmic dust and dead.
463,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And if some tears be shed,"
464,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Some evil God have power,"
465,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Some crown of sorrow sit
466,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Upon a little world for a little hour--

475,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,For all our hopes in endless ruin lie.
476,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The good is dead. Let us curse God most High.
477,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
478,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Four thousand years of toil and hope and thought
479,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Wherein man laboured upward and still wrought
480,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"New worlds and better, Thou hast made as naught."
481,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
482,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"We built us joyful cities, strong and fair,"
483,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Knowledge we sought and gathered wisdom rare.
484,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And all this time you laughed upon our care,"
485,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
486,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And suddenly the earth grew black with wrong,"
487,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Our hope was crushed and silenced was our song,"
488,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The heaven grew loud with weeping. Thou art strong.
489,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
490,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Come then and curse the Lord. Over the earth
491,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Gross darkness falls, and evil was our birth"
492,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And our few happy days of little worth.
493,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
494,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Even if it be not all a dream in vain
495,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The ancient hope that still will rise again--
496,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of a just God that cares for earthly pain,"
497,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
498,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yet far away beyond our labouring night,"
499,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"He wanders in the depths of endless light,"
500,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Singing alone his musics of delight;
501,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
502,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Only the far, spent echo of his song"
503,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Our dungeons and deep cells can smite along,"
504,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And Thou art nearer. Thou art very strong.
505,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
506,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"O universal strength, I know it well,"
507,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,It is but froth of folly to rebel;
508,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,For thou art Lord and hast the keys of Hell.
509,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
510,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yet I will not bow down to thee nor love thee,"
511,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For looking in my own heart I can prove thee,"

513,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
514,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Our love, our hope, our thirsting for the right,"

517,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
518,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Laugh then and slay. Shatter all things of worth,"
519,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Heap torment still on torment for thy mirth--

528,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Material things, and all these signs arrayed"
529,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Above you and have set beneath the race
530,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of mankind, who forget their Father's face"
531,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And even while they drink my light of day
532,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Dream of some other gods and disobey
533,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"My warnings, and despise my holy laws,"
534,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Even tho' their sin shall slay them. For which cause,"
535,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Dreams dreamed in vain, a never-filled desire"
536,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And in close flesh a spiritual fire,"
537,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"A thirst for good their kind shall not attain,"
538,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,A backward cleaving to the beast again.
539,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"A loathing for the life that I have given,"
540,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"A haunted, twisted soul for ever riven"
541,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Between their will and mine-such lot I give
542,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,White still in my despite the vermin live.
543,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,They hate my world! Then let that other God
544,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Come from the outer spaces glory-shod,"
545,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And from this castle I have built on Night
546,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Steal forth my own thought's children into light,"
547,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,If such an one there be. But far away
548,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"He walks the airy fields of endless day,"
549,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And my rebellious sons have called Him long
550,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And vainly called. My order still is strong
551,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And like to me nor second none I know.

559,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Trapped amid the woods with guile
560,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,They've led her bound in fetters vile
561,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"To death, a deadlier sorceress"
562,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Than any born for earth's distress
563,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Since first the winner of the fleece
564,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Bore home the Colchian witch to Greece--
565,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Seven months with snare and gin
566,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,They've sought the maid o'erwise within
567,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The forest's labyrinthine shade.
568,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The lonely woodman half afraid
569,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Far off her ragged form has seen
570,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Sauntering down the alleys green,"
571,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Or crouched in godless prayer alone
572,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,At eve before a Druid stone.
573,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But now the bitter chase is won,"
574,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The quarry's caught, her magic's done,"
575,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The bishop's brought her strongest spell
576,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"To naught with candle, book, and bell;"
577,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"With holy water splashed upon her,"
578,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,She goes to burning and dishonour
579,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Too deeply damned to feel her shame,"
580,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For, though beneath her hair of flame"
581,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Her thoughtful head be lowly bowed
582,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,It droops for meditation proud
583,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Impenitent, and pondering yet"
584,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Things no memory can forget,"
585,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Starry wonders she has seen
586,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Brooding in the wildwood green
587,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With holiness. For who can say
588,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"In what strange crew she loved to play,"
589,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,What demons or what gods of old
590,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Deep mysteries unto her have told
591,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,At dead of night in worship bent
592,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"At ruined shrines magnificent,"
593,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Or how the quivering will she sent
594,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Alone into the great alone
595,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Where all is loved and all is known,"
596,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Who now lifts up her maiden eyes
597,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And looks around with soft surprise
598,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Upon the noisy, crowded square,"
599,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The city oafs that nod and stare,"
600,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The bishop's court that gathers there,"
601,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The faggots and the blackened stake
602,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Where sinners die for justice' sake?
603,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Now she is set upon the pile,"
604,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The mob grows still a little while,"
605,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Till lo! before the eager folk
606,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Up curls a thin, blue line of smoke."

616,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Shudders before this universal plan,"
617,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"So grievous is the burden and the pain,"
618,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"So heavy weighs the long, material chain"
619,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"From cause to cause, too merciless for hate,"
620,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The nightmare march of unrelenting fate,"
621,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I think that he must die thereof unless
622,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Ever and again across the dreariness
623,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"There came a sudden glimpse of spirit faces,"
624,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,A fragrant breath to tell of flowery places
625,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And wider oceans, breaking on the shore"
626,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,From which the hearts of men are always sore.
627,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,It lies beyond endeavour; neither prayer
628,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Nor fasting, nor much wisdom winneth there,"
629,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Seeing how many prophets and wise men
630,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Have sought for it and still returned again
631,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With hope undone. But only the strange power
632,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Of unsought Beauty in some casual hour
633,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Can build a bridge of light or sound or form
634,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To lead you out of all this strife and storm;
635,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,When of some beauty we are grown a part
636,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Till from its very glory's midmost heart
637,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Out leaps a sudden beam of larger light
638,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Into our souls. All things are seen aright
639,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Amid the blinding pillar of its gold,"
640,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Seven times more true than what for truth we hold
641,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,In vulgar hours. The miracle is done
642,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And for one little moment we are one
643,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With the eternal stream of loveliness
644,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"That flows so calm, aloft from all distress"
645,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Yet leaps and lives around us as a fire
646,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Making us faint with overstrong desire
647,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To sport and swim for ever in its deep--
648,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Only a moment.
649,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,O! but we shall keep
650,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Our vision still. One moment was enough,"
651,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,We know we are not made of mortal stuff.
652,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And we can bear all trials that come after,"
653,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The hate of men and the fool's loud bestial laughter
654,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And Nature's rule and cruelties unclean,"

663,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Chosen from all the sons of men
664,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To lead his fellows on the way
665,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of hidden knowledge, delving deep"
666,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To nameless mysteries that keep
667,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Their secret from the solar day!
668,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Or who shall pierce with surer eye!
669,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,This shifting veil of bittersweet
670,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And find the real things that lie
671,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Beyond this turmoil, which we greet"
672,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With such a wasted wealth of tears?
673,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Who shall cross over for us the bridge of fears
674,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And pass in to the country where the ancient Mothers dwell?
675,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Is it an elder, bent and hoar"
676,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Who, where the waste Atlantic swell"
677,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"On lonely beaches makes its roar,"
678,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,In his solitary tower
679,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Through the long night hour by hour
680,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Pores on old books with watery eye
681,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"When all his youth has passed him by,"
682,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And folly is schooled and love is dead
683,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And frozen fancy laid abed,"
684,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,While in his veins the gradual blood
685,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Slackens to a marish flood?
686,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For he rejoiceth not in the ocean's might,"
687,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Neither the sun giveth delight,"
688,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Nor the moon by night
689,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Shall call his feet to wander in the haunted forest lawn.
690,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,He shall no more rise suddenly in the dawn
691,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,When mists are white and the dew lies pearly
692,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Cold and cold on every meadow,"
693,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"To take his joy of the season early,"
694,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The opening flower and the westward shadow,"
695,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And scarcely can he dream of laughter and love,"
696,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,They lie so many leaden years behind.
697,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Such eyes are dim and blind,"
698,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the sad, aching head that nods above"
699,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,His monstrous books can never know
700,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The secret we would find.
701,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,But let our seer be young and kind
702,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And fresh and beautiful of show,"
703,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And taken ere the lustyhead
704,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And rapture of his youth be dead;
705,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Ere the gnawing, peasant reason"
706,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,School him over-deep in treason
707,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To the ancient high estate
708,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of his fancy's principate,"
709,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"That he may live a perfect whole,"
710,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"A mask of the eternal soul,"
711,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And cross at last the shadowy bar
712,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To where the ever-living are.

720,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The shifting faces and the changeful hue
721,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of markets, and broad echoing streets that drown"
722,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The heart's own silent music. Though they too
723,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Sing in their proper rhythm, and still delight"
724,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The friendly ear that loves warm human kind,"
725,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yet it is good to leave them all behind,"
726,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Now when from lily dawn to purple night
727,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Summer is queen,"
728,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Summer is queen in all the happy land.
729,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Far, far away among the valleys green"
730,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Let us go forth and wander hand in hand
731,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Beyond those solemn hills that we have seen
732,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,So often welcome home the falling sun
733,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Into their cloudy peaks when day was done--
734,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Beyond them till we find the ocean strand
735,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And hear the great waves run,"
736,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With the waste song whose melodies I'd follow
737,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And weary not for many a summer day,"
738,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Born of the vaulted breakers arching hollow
739,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Before they flash and scatter into spray,"
740,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"On, if we should be weary of their play"
741,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Then I would lead you further into land
742,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Where, with their ragged walls, the stately rocks"
743,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Shunt in smooth courts and paved with quiet sand
744,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To silence dedicate. The sea-god's flocks

746,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,By great adventure at the dead of noon

759,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Drags, that scarce the proudest flower"
760,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Pressed upon its burning bed
761,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Has strength to lift a languid head:--
762,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Rose and fainting violet
763,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,By the water's margin set
764,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Swoon and sink as they were dead
765,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Though their weary leaves be fed
766,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With the foam-drops of the pool
767,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Where it trembles dark and cool
768,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Wrinkled by the fountain spraying
769,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,O'er it. And the honey-bee
770,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Hums his drowsy melody
771,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And wanders in his course a-straying
772,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Through the sweet and tangled glade
773,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"With his golden mead o'erladen,"
774,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Where beneath the pleasant shade

795,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
796,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Barren once thought because my eyes were dim.
797,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Like one I am grown to whom the common field

812,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,XX. Sonnet
813,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
814,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The stars come out; the fragrant shadows fall
815,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"About a dreaming garden still and sweet,"
816,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I hear the unseen bats above me bleat
817,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Among the ghostly moths their hunting call,"
818,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And twinkling glow-worms all about me crawl.
819,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Now for a chamber dim, a pillow meet"
820,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For slumbers deep as death, a faultless sheet,"
821,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Cool, white and smooth. So may I reach the hall"
822,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With poppies strewn where sleep that is so dear
823,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With magic sponge can wipe away an hour
824,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Or twelve and make them naught. Why not a year,"
825,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Why could a man not loiter in that bower
826,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Until a thousand painless cycles wore,"
827,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And then-what if it held him evermore?

832,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,XXI. The Autumn Morning
833,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
834,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,See! the pale autumn dawn
835,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Is faint, upon the lawn"
836,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That lies in powdered white
837,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Of hoar-frost dight
838,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
839,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And now from tree to tree
840,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The ghostly mist we see
841,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Hung like a silver pall
842,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To hallow all.
843,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
844,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,It wreathes the burdened air
845,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,So strangely everywhere
846,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That I could almost fear
847,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,This silence drear
848,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
849,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Where no one song-bird sings
850,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And dream that wizard things
851,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Mighty for hate or love
852,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Were close above.
853,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
854,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,White as the fog and fair
855,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Drifting through the middle air
856,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,In magic dances dread
857,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Over my head.
858,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
859,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Yet these should know me too
860,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Lover and bondman true,"
861,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,One that has honoured well
862,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The mystic spell
863,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
864,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Of earth's most solemn hours
865,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Wherein the ancient powers
866,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of dryad, elf, or faun"
867,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Or leprechaun
868,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
869,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Oft have their faces shown
870,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To me that walked alone
871,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Seashore or haunted fen
872,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Or mountain glen
873,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
874,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Wherefore I will not fear
875,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To walk the woodlands sere
876,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Into this autumn day
877,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Far, far away."

883,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
884,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,XXII. L'Apprenti Sorcier
885,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
886,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Suddenly there came to me
887,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The music of a mighty sea
888,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That on a bare and iron shore
889,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Thundered with a deeper roar
890,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Than all the tides that leap and run
891,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With us below the real sun:
892,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Because the place was far away,"
893,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Above, beyond our homely day,"
894,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Neighbouring close the frozen clime
895,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Where out of all the woods of time,"
896,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Amid the frightful seraphim
897,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The fierce, cold eyes of Godhead gleam,"
898,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Revolving hate and misery
899,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And wars and famines yet to be.
900,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And in my dreams I stood alone
901,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Upon a shelf of weedy stone,"
902,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And saw before my shrinking eyes
903,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The dark, enormous breakers rise,"
904,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And hover and fall with deafening thunder
905,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Of thwarted foam that echoed under
906,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The ledge, through many a cavern drear,"
907,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With hollow sounds of wintry fear.
908,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And through the waters waste and grey,"
909,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Thick-strown for many a league away,"
910,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Out of the toiling sea arose
911,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Many a face and form of those
912,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Thin, elemental people dear"
913,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Who live beyond our heavy sphere.
914,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And all at once from far and near,"
915,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"They all held out their arms to me,"
916,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Crying in their melody,"
917,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""Leap in! Leap in and take thy fill"
918,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of all the cosmic good and ill,"
919,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Be as the Living ones that know
920,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Enormous joy, enormous woe,"
921,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Pain beyond thought and fiery bliss:
922,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For all thy study hunted this,"
923,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"On wings of magic to arise,"
924,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And wash from off thy filmed eyes
925,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The cloud of cold mortality,"
926,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To find the real life and be
927,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,As are the children of the deep!
928,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Be bold and dare the glorious leap,"
929,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Or to thy shame, go, slink again"
930,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Back to the narrow ways of men."""
931,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,So all these mocked me as I stood
932,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Striving to wake because I feared the flood.

938,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
939,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,There is a house that most of all on earth I hate.
940,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Though I have passed through many sorrows and have been
941,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"In bloody fields, sad seas, and countries desolate,"
942,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Yet most I fear that empty house where the grasses green
943,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Grow in the silent court the gaping flags between,"
944,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And down the moss-grown paths and terrace no man treads
945,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Where the old, old weeds rise deep on the waste garden beds."
946,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Like eyes of one long dead the empty windows stare
947,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And I fear to cross the garden, I fear to linger there,"
948,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For in that house I know a little, silent room"
949,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Where Someone's always waiting, waiting in the gloom"
950,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"To draw me with an evil eye, and hold me fast--"
951,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Yet thither doom will drive me and He will win at last.

957,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
958,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Thank God that there are solid folk
959,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Who water flowers and roll the lawn,"
960,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And sit an sew and talk and smoke,"
961,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And snore all through the summer dawn.
962,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
963,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Who pass untroubled nights and days
964,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Full-fed and sleepily content,"
965,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Rejoicing in each other's praise,"
966,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Respectable and innocent.
967,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
968,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Who feel the things that all men feel,"
969,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And think in well-worn grooves of thought,"
970,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Whose honest spirits never reel
971,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Before man's mystery, overwrought."
972,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
973,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yet not unfaithful nor unkind,"
974,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"with work-day virtues surely staid,"
975,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Theirs is the sane and humble mind,"
976,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And dull affections undismayed.
977,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
978,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,O happy people! I have seen
979,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"No verse yet written in your praise,"
980,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And, truth to tell, the time has been"
981,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I would have scorned your easy ways.
982,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
983,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,But now thro' weariness and strife
984,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I learn your worthiness indeed,"
985,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The world is better for such life
986,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,As stout suburban people lead.
987,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
988,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Too often have I sat alone
989,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"When the wet night falls heavily,"
990,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And fretting winds around me moan,"
991,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And homeless longing vexes me
992,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
993,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For lore that I shall never know,"
994,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And visions none can hope to see,"
995,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Till brooding works upon me so
996,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,A childish fear steals over me.
997,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
998,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I look around the empty room,"
999,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The clock still ticking in its place,"
1000,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And all else silent as the tomb,"
1001,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Till suddenly, I think, a face"
1002,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1003,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Grows from the darkness just beside.
1004,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I turn, and lo! it fades away,"
1005,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And soon another phantom tide
1006,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of shifting dreams begins to play,"
1007,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1008,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And dusky galleys past me sail,"
1009,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Full freighted on a faerie sea;
1010,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I hear the silken merchants hail
1011,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Across the ringing waves to me
1012,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1013,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"--Then suddenly, again, the room,"
1014,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Familiar books about me piled,"
1015,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And I alone amid the gloom,"
1016,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,By one more mocking dream beguiled.
1017,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1018,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And still no neared to the Light,"
1019,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And still no further from myself,"
1020,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Alone and lost in clinging night--
1021,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,(The clock's still ticking on the shelf).
1022,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1023,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Then do I envy solid folk
1024,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Who sit of evenings by the fire,"
1025,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"After their work and doze and smoke,"
1026,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And are not fretted by desire.

1034,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1035,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"O Dwellers at the back of the North Wind,"
1036,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,What have we done to you? How have we sinned
1037,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Wandering the Earth from Orkney unto Ind?
1038,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1039,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"With many deaths our fellowship is thinned,"
1040,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Our flesh is withered in the parching wind,"
1041,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Wandering the earth from Orkney unto Ind.
1042,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1043,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,We have no rest. We cannot turn again
1044,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Back to the world and all her fruitless pain,"
1045,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Having once sought the land where ye remain.
1046,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1047,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Some say ye are not. But, ah God! we know"
1048,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"That somewhere, somewhere past the Northern snow"
1049,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Waiting for us the red-rose gardens blow:
1050,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1051,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,--The red-rose and the white-rose gardens blow
1052,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"In the green Northern land to which we go,"
1053,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Surely the ways are long and the years are slow.
1054,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1055,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"We have forsaken all things sweet and fair,"
1056,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,We have found nothing worth a moment's care
1057,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Because the real flowers are blowing there.
1058,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1059,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Land of the Lotus fallen from the sun,"
1060,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Land of the Lake from whence all rivers run,"
1061,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Land where the hope of all our dreams is won!
1062,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1063,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Shall we not somewhere see at close of day
1064,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The green walls of that country far away,"
1065,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And hear the music of her fountains play?
1066,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1067,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,So long we have been wandering all this while
1068,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"By many a perilous sea and drifting isle,"
1069,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,We scarce shall dare to look thereon and smile.
1070,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1071,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yea, when we are drawing very near to thee,"
1072,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And when at last the ivory port we see
1073,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Our hearts will faint with mere felicity:
1074,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1075,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,But we shall wake again in gardens bright
1076,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of green and gold for infinite delight,"
1077,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Sleeping beneath the solemn mountains white,"
1078,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,While from the flowery copses still unseen
1079,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Sing out the crooning birds that ne'er have been
1080,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Touched by the hand of winter frore and lean;
1081,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1082,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And ever living queens that grow not old
1083,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And poets wise in robes of faerie gold
1084,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Whisper a wild, sweet song that first was told"
1085,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1086,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Ere God sat down to make the Milky Way.
1087,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And in those gardens we shall sleep and play
1088,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,For ever and for ever and a day.
1089,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1090,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Ah, Dwellers at the back of the North Wind,"
1091,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"What have we done to you? How have we sinned,"
1092,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That yes should hide beyond the Northern wind?
1093,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1094,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Land of the Lotus, fallen from the Sun,"
1095,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"When shall your hidden, flowery vales be won"
1096,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And all the travail of our way be done?
1097,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1098,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Very far we have searched; we have even seen
1099,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The Scythian waste that bears no soft nor green,"
1100,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And near the Hideous Pass our feet have been.
1101,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1102,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,We have heard Syrens singing all night long
1103,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Beneath the unknown stars their lonely song
1104,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,In friendless seas beyond the Pillars strong.
1105,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1106,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Nor by the dragon-daughter of Hypocras
1107,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Nor the vale of the Devil's head we have feared to pass,"
1108,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yet is our labour lost and vain, alas!"
1109,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1110,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Scouring the earth from Orkney unto Ind,"
1111,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Tossed on the seas and withered in the wind,"
1112,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,We seek and seek your land. How have we sinned?
1113,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1114,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Or is it all a folly of the wise,"
1115,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Bidding us walk these ways with blinded eyes
1116,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,While all around us real flowers arise?
1117,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1118,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But, by the very God, we know, we know"
1119,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"That somewhere still, beyond the Northern snow"
1120,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Waiting for us the red-rose gardens blow.

1128,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Or the satyrs' laughing broods--
1129,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Tritons in the summer sea,"
1130,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Else how could the dead things be
1131,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Half so lovely as they are?
1132,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,How could wealth of star on star
1133,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Dusted o'er the frosty night
1134,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Fill thy spirit with delight
1135,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And lead thee from this care of thine
1136,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Up among the dreams divine,"
1137,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Were it not that each and all
1138,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Of them that walk the heavenly hall
1139,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Is in truth a happy isle,"
1140,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Where eternal meadows smile,"
1141,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And golden globes of fruit are seen
1142,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Twinkling through the orchards green;
1143,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Were the Other People go
1144,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,On the bright sward to and fro?
1145,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Atoms dead could never thus
1146,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Stir the human heart of us
1147,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Unless the beauty that we see
1148,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The veil of endless beauty be,"
1149,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Filled full of spirits that have trod
1150,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Far hence along the heavenly sod
1151,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And see the bright footprints of God.

1157,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1158,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I woke and rose and slipt away
1159,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To the heathery hills in the morning grey.
1160,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1161,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,In a field where the dew lay cold and deep
1162,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I met an ass, new-roused from sleep."
1163,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1164,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"I stroked his nose and I tickled his ears,"
1165,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And spoke soft words to quiet his fears.
1166,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1167,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,His eyes stared into the eyes of me
1168,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And he kissed my hands of his courtesy.
1169,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1170,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""O big, brown brother out of the waste,"
1171,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,How do thistles for breakfast taste?
1172,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1173,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""And do you rejoice in the dawn divine"
1174,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With a heart that is glad no less than mine?
1175,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1176,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""For, brother, the depth of your gentle eyes"
1177,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Is strange and mystic as the skies:
1178,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1179,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""What are the thoughts that grope behind,"
1180,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Down in the mist of a donkey mind?
1181,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1182,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""Can it be true, as the wise men tell,"
1183,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"That you are a mask of God as well,"
1184,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1185,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""And, as in us, so in you no less"
1186,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Speaks the eternal Loveliness,"
1187,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1188,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""And words of the lips that all things know"
1189,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Among the thoughts of a donkey go?
1190,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1191,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""However it be, O four-foot brother,"
1192,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Fair to-day is the earth, our mother."
1193,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1194,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""God send you peace and delight thereof,"

1196,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1197,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"""And guard you well from violent men"
1198,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Who'd put you back in the shafts again."""
1199,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1200,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,But the ass had far too wise a head
1201,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"To answer one of the things I said,"
1202,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1203,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,So he twitched his fair ears up and down
1204,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And turned to nuzzle his shoulder brown.

1210,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1211,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The big, red-house is bare and lone"
1212,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The stony garden waste and sere
1213,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With blight of breezes ocean blown
1214,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To pinch the wakening of the year;
1215,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,My kindly friends with busy cheer
1216,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,My wretchedness could plainly show.
1217,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,They tell me I am lonely here--
1218,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,What do they know? What do they know?
1219,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1220,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,They think that while the gables moan
1221,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And easements creak in winter drear
1222,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I should be piteously alone

1259,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Hear the wild, strange, tuneless song"
1260,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of faerie voices, thin and high"

1262,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And the measure of their shoon

1276,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And such a spell around them made

1366,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1367,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And some there are that in their daily walks

1391,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1392,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I heard the swallow sing in the eaves and rose
1393,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"All in a strange delight while others slept,"
1394,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And down the creaking stair, alone, tip-toes,"
1395,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,So carefully I crept.
1396,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1397,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The house was dark with silly blinds yet drawn,"
1398,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But outside the clean air was filled with light,"
1399,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And underneath my feet the cold, wet lawn"
1400,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,With dew was twinkling bright.
1401,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1402,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The cobwebs hung from every branch and spray
1403,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Gleaming with pearly strands of laden thread,"
1404,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And long and still the morning shadows lay
1405,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Across the meadows spread.
1406,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1407,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"At that pure hour when yet no sound of man,"
1408,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Stirs in the whiteness of the wakening earth,"
1409,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Alone through innocent solitudes I ran
1410,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Singing aloud for mirth.
1411,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1412,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Till I had found the open mountain heath
1413,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yellow with gorse, and rested there and stood"
1414,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"To gaze upon the misty sea beneath,"
1415,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Or on the neighbouring wood,"
1416,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1417,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,--That little wood of hazel and tall pine
1418,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And youngling fir, where oft we have loved to see"
1419,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,The level beams of early morning shine
1420,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Freshly from tree to tree.
1421,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1422,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Through the denser wood there's many a pool
1423,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Of deep and night-born shadow lingers yet
1424,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Where the new-wakened flowers are damp and cool
1425,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And the long grass is wet.
1426,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1427,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,In the sweet heather long I rested there

1432,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Swift, naked, eager, pitilessly fair,"
1433,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"With a live crown of birds about his head,"

1435,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Far out behind him spread,"
1436,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1437,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Streamed like a rippling torch upon the breeze
1438,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Of his own glorious swiftness: in the grass
1439,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"He bruised no feathery stalk, and through the trees"
1440,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I saw his whiteness pass.
1441,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1442,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But when I followed him beyond the wood,"
1443,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Lo! He was changed into a solemn bull
1444,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,That there upon the open pasture stood
1445,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And browsed his lazy full.

1459,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1460,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I see them dip in the valleys and vanish and rise and bend
1461,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"From shadowy dell to windswept fell, and still to the West they wend,"
1462,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And over the cold blue ridge at last to the great world's uttermost end.
1463,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1464,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the call of the roads is upon me, a desire in my spirit has grown"
1465,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"To wander forth in the highways, 'twixt earth and sky alone,"
1466,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And seek for the lands no foot has trod and the seas no sail has known:
1467,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1468,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"For the lands to the west of the evening and east of the morning's birth,"
1469,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Where the gods unseen in their valleys green are glad at the ends of the earth

1537,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Where monstrous bergs beyond Varanger stray,"
1538,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Rising from sunless depths that no man knows;
1539,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Thither as clustering fireflies have I seen
1540,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,At fixed seasons all the stars come down
1541,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,To wash in that cold wave their brightness clean
1542,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And win the special fire wherewith they crown

1628,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the mountains rise above, and the cold ravine"
1629,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Echoes to the crushing roar and thunder of a mighty river
1630,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Raging down a cataract. Very tower and forest quiver
1631,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the grey wolves are afraid and the call of birds is drowned,"
1632,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And the thought and speech of man in the boiling water's sound.
1633,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But upon the further side of the barren, sharp ravine"
1634,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"With the sunlight on its turrets is the castle seen,"
1635,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Calm and very wonderful, white above the green"
1636,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Of the wet and waving forest, slanted all away,"
1637,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Because the driving Northern wind will not rest by night or day.
1638,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Yet the towers are sure above, very mighty is the stead,"
1639,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The gates are made of ivory, the roofs of copper red."
1640,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1641,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Round and round the warders grave walk upon the walls for ever
1642,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And the wakeful dragons couch in the ports of ivory,"
1643,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Nothing is can trouble it, hate of the gods nor man's endeavour,"
1644,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And it shall be a resting-place, dear heart, for you and me."
1645,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1646,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Through the wet and waving forest with an age-old sorrow laden
1647,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Singing of the world's regret wanders wild the faerie maiden,"
1648,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Through the thistle and the brier, through the tangles of the thorn,"
1649,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Till her eyes be dim with weeping and her homeless feet are torn.
1650,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1651,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Often to the castle gate up she looks with vain endeavour,"
1652,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,For her soulless loveliness to the castle winneth never.
1653,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1654,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But within the sacred court, hidden high upon the mountain,"
1655,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Wandering in the castle gardens lovely folk enough there be,"
1656,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Breathing in another air, drinking of a purer fountain"
1657,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And among that folk, beloved, there's a place for you and me."
1658,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1659,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1660,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1661,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1662,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,XL. Death in Battle
1663,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1664,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Open the gates for me,"
1665,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Open the gates of the peaceful castle, rosy in the West,"
1666,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"In the sweet dim Isle of Apples over the wide sea's breast,"
1667,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1668,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Open the gates for me!
1669,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1670,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Sorely pressed have I been
1671,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"And driven and hurt beyond bearing this summer day,"
1672,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But the heat and the pain together suddenly fall away,"
1673,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,All's cool and green.
1674,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1675,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But a moment agone,"
1676,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Among men cursing in fight and toiling, blinded I fought,"
1677,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"But the labour passed on a sudden even as a passing thought,"
1678,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1679,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,And now-alone!
1680,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1681,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Ah, to be ever alone,"
1682,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"In flowery valleys among the mountains and silent wastes untrod,"
1683,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"In the dewy upland places, in the garden of God,"
1684,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,This would atone!
1685,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1686,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,I shall not see
1687,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"The brutal, crowded faces around me, that in their toil have grown"
1688,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Into the faces of devils-yea, even as my own--"
1689,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"When I find thee,"
1690,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1691,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,O Country of Dreams!
1692,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Beyond the tide of the ocean, hidden and sunk away,"
1693,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,"Out of the sound of battles, near to the end of day,"
1694,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,Full of dim woods and streams.
1695,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1696,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
1697,A CYCLE OF LYRICS,
