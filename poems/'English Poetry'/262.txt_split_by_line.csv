43,I,I
44,I,
45,I,Rupert Brooke was both fair to see and winning in his ways.  There was
46,I,at the first contact both bloom and charm; and most of all there was life.
47,I,"To use the word his friends describe him by, he was ""vivid""."
48,I,"This vitality, though manifold in expression, is felt primarily"
49,I,in his sensations -- surprise mingled with delight --
50,I,
51,I,"""One after one, like tasting a sweet food."""
52,I,
53,I,"This is life's ""first fine rapture"".  It makes him patient to"
54,I,name over those myriad things (each of which seems like a fresh discovery)
55,I,"curious but potent, and above all common, that he ""loved"", --"
56,I,"he the ""Great Lover"".  Lover of what, then?  Why, of"
57,I,
58,I,"""White plates and cups clean-gleaming,"
59,I,"Ringed with blue lines,"" --"
60,I,
61,I,"and the like, through thirty lines of exquisite words; and he is captivated"
62,I,"by the multiple brevity of these vignettes of sense, keen, momentary,"
63,I,ecstatic with the morning dip of youth in the wonderful stream.
64,I,"The poem is a catalogue of vital sensations and ""dear names"" as well."
65,I,"""All these have been my loves."""
66,I,
67,I,"The spring of these emotions is the natural body, but it sends pulsations"
68,I,"far into the spirit.  The feeling rises in direct observation,"
69,I,"but it is soon aware of the ""outlets of the sky""."
70,I,"He sees objects practically unrelated, and links them in strings;"
71,I,"or he sees them pictorially; or, he sees pictures immersed as it were"
72,I,"in an atmosphere of thought.  When the process is complete,"
73,I,the thought suggests the picture and is its origin.
74,I,"Then the Great Lover revisits the bottom of the monstrous world,"
75,I,"and imaginatively and thoughtfully recreates that strange under-sea,"
76,I,whose glooms and gleams and muds are well known to him as
77,I,"a strong and delighted swimmer; or, at the last, drifts through the dream"
78,I,"of a South Sea lagoon, still with a philosophical question in his mouth."
79,I,"Yet one can hardly speak of ""completion"".  These are real first flights."
80,I,What we have in this volume is not so much a work of art
81,I,as an artist in his birth trying the wings of genius.
82,I,
83,I,The poet loves his new-found element.  He clings to mortality;
84,I,"to life, not thought; or, as he puts it, to the concrete, --"
85,I,"let the abstract ""go pack!""  ""There's little comfort in the wise,"" he ends."
86,I,"But in the unfolding of his precocious spirit, the literary control"
87,I,"comes uppermost; his boat, finding its keel, swings to the helm of mind."
88,I,"How should it be otherwise for a youth well-born, well-bred,"
89,I,in college air?  Intellectual primacy showed itself to him
90,I,"in many wandering ""loves"", fine lover that he was; but in the end"
91,I,"he was an intellectual lover, and the magnet seems to have been"
92,I,"especially powerful in the ghosts of the men of ""wit"", Donne, Marvell --"
93,I,"erudite lords of language, poets in another world than ours,"
94,I,"a less ""ample ether"", a less ""divine air"", our fathers thought,"
95,I,"but poets of ""eternity"".  A quintessential drop of intellect"
96,I,"is apt to be in poetic blood.  How Platonism fascinates the poets,"
97,I,like a shining bait!  Rupert Brooke will have none of it;
98,I,"but at a turn of the verse he is back at it, examining, tasting, refusing."
99,I,In those alternate drives of the thought in his South Sea idyl
100,I,"(clever as tennis play) how he slips from phenomenon to idea and reverses,"
101,I,"happy with either, it seems, ""were t'other dear charmer away""."
102,I,"How bravely he tries to free himself from the cling of earth,"
103,I,"at the close of the ""Great Lover""!  How little he succeeds!"
104,I,"His muse knew only earthly tongues, -- so far as he understood."
105,I,
106,I,"Why this persistent cling to mortality, -- with its quick-coming cry"
107,I,against death and its heaped anathemas on the transformations of decay?
108,I,"It is the old story once more: -- the vision of the first poets,"
109,I,"the world that ""passes away"".  The poetic eye of Keats saw it, --"
110,I,
111,I,"""Beauty that must die,"
112,I,And Joy whose hand is ever at his lips
113,I,"Bidding adieu."""
114,I,
115,I,"The reflective mind of Arnold meditated it, --"
116,I,
117,I,"""the world that seems"
118,I,"To lie before us like a land of dreams,"
119,I,"So various, so beautiful, so new,"
120,I,"Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,"
121,I,"Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain."" --"
122,I,
123,I,"So Rupert Brooke, --"
124,I,
125,I,"""But the best I've known,"
126,I,"Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown"
127,I,"About the winds of the world, and fades from brains"
128,I,"Of living men, and dies."
129,I,"Nothing remains."""
130,I,
131,I,"And yet, --"
132,I,
133,I,"""Oh, never a doubt but somewhere I shall wake;"""
134,I,
135,I,"again, --"
136,I,
137,I,"""the light,"
138,I,"Returning, shall give back the golden hours,"
139,I,"Ocean a windless level. . . ."""
140,I,
141,I,"again, best of all, in the last word, --"
142,I,
143,I,"""Still may Time hold some golden space"
144,I,Where I'll unpack that scented store
145,I,"Of song and flower and sky and face,"
146,I,"And count, and touch, and turn them o'er,"
147,I,"Musing upon them."""
148,I,
149,I,"He cannot forego his sensations, that ""box of compacted sweets""."
150,I,He even forefeels a ghostly landscape where two shall go wandering
151,I,"through the night, ""alone"".  So the faith that broke its chrysalis"
152,I,"in the first disillusionment of boyhood, in ""Second Best"","
153,I,"beautiful with the burden of Greek lyricism, ends triumphant"
154,I,with the spirit still unsubdued. --
155,I,
156,I,"""Proud, then, clear-eyed and laughing, go to greet"
157,I,"Death as a friend."""
158,I,
159,I,"So go, ""with unreluctant tread"".  But in the disillusionment of beauty"
160,I,"and of love there is an older tone.  With what bitter savor, with what"
161,I,"grossness of diction, caught from the Elizabethan and satirical elements"
162,I,"in his culture, he spends anger in words!  He reacts, he rebels, he storms."
163,I,A dozen poems hardly exhaust his gall.  It is not merely
164,I,"that beauty and joy and love are transient, now, but in their going"
165,I,"they are corrupted into their opposites, -- ugliness, pain, indifference."
166,I,"And his anger once stilled by speech, what lassitude follows!"
167,I,
168,I,"Life, in this volume, is hardly less evident by its ecstasy"
169,I,"than by its collapse.  It is a book of youth, sensitive, vigorous, sound;"
170,I,"but it is the fruit of intensity, and bears the traits."
171,I,"The search for solitude, the relief from crowds, the open door into nature;"
172,I,"the sense of flight and escape; the repeated thought of safety,"
173,I,"the insistent fatigue, the cry for sleep; -- all these bear confession"
174,I,"in their faces.  ""Flight"", ""Town and Country"", ""The Voice"", are eloquent"
175,I,"of what they leave untold; and the climax of ""Retrospect"", --"
176,I,
177,I,"""And I should sleep, and I should sleep,"" --"
178,I,
179,I,"or the sestet of ""Waikiki"", or the whole fainting sonnet"
180,I,"entitled ""A Memory"", belong to the nadir of vitality.  At moments"
181,I,"weariness set in like a spiritual tide.  I associate, too, with such moods,"
182,I,"psychologically at least, his visions of the ""arrested moment"", as in"
183,I,"""Dining-Room Tea"", -- a sort of trance state -- or in the pendant sonnet."
184,I,Analogous moods are not infrequent in the great poets.  Rupert Brooke
185,I,"seems to have faltered, nervously, at times; these poems mirror faithfully"
186,I,"such moments.  But even when the image of life, imaginative or real,"
187,I,"falters so, how essentially vital it still is, and clothed in an exquisite"
188,I,"body of words like the traditional ""rainbow hues of the dying fish""!"
189,I,For I cannot express too strongly my admiration of the literary sense
190,I,"of this young poet, and my delight in it.  ""All these have been my loves,"""
191,I,"he says, if I may repeat the phrase; but he seems to have loved the words,"
192,I,"as much as the things, -- ""dear names"", he adds.  The born man of letters"
193,I,"speaks there.  So, when his pulse is at its lowest,"
194,I,he cannot forget the beautiful surface of his South Sea idyls
195,I,or of versified English gardens and lanes.  He cared as much
196,I,"for the expression as for the thing, which is what makes a man of letters."
197,I,"So fixed is this habit that his art, truly, is independent"
198,I,"of his bodily state.  In his poems of ""collapse"" as in those of ""ecstasy"""
199,I,"he seems to me equally master of his mood, -- like those poets who are"
200,I,"""for all time"".  His literary skill in verse was ripe, how long so ever"
201,I,he might have to live.
202,I,
203,I,
204,II,II
205,II,
206,II,"To come, then, to art, which is above personality, what of that?  Art is,"
207,II,"at most, but the mortal relic of genius; yet it is true of it that,"
208,II,"like Ozymandias' statue, ""nothing beside remains"".  Rupert Brooke was"
209,II,already perfected in verbal and stylistic execution.  He might have grown
210,II,"in variety, richness and significance, in scope and in detail, no doubt;"
211,II,"but as an artisan in metrical words and pauses, he was past apprenticeship."
212,II,"He was still a restless experimenter, but in much he was a master."
213,II,"In the brief stroke of description, which he inherited from"
214,II,"his early attachment to the concrete; in the rush of words,"
215,II,"especially verbs; in the concatenation of objects, the flow of things"
216,II,"'en masse' through his verse, still with the impulse of ""the bright speed"""
217,II,"he had at the source; in his theatrical impersonation of abstractions,"
218,II,"as in ""The Funeral of Youth"", where for once the abstract and the concrete"
219,II,"are happily fused; -- in all these there are the elements, and in the last"
220,II,"there is the perfection, of mastery.  For one thing, he knew how to end."
221,II,It is with him a dramatic secret.  The brief stroke does this work
222,II,"time and time again in his verse, nowhere better than in"
223,II,"""at dead YOUTH's funeral:"" all were there, --"
224,II,
225,II,"""All, except only LOVE -- LOVE had died long ago."""
226,II,
227,II,The poem is like a vision of an old time MASQUE: --
228,II,
229,II,"""The sweet lad RHYME"" ----"
230,II,"""ARDOUR, the sunlight on his greying hair"" ----"
231,II,"""BEAUTY . . . pale in her black; dry-eyed, she stood alone."""
232,II,
233,II,"How vivid!  The lines owe something to his eye for costume, for staging;"
234,II,"but, as mere picture writing, it is as firm as if carved on an obelisk."
235,II,"And as he reconciled concrete and abstract here, so he had left"
236,II,"his short breath, in those earlier lines, behind, and had come into"
237,II,the long sweep and open water of great style: --
238,II,
239,II,"""And light on waving grass, he knows not when,"
240,II,"And feet that ran, but where, he cannot tell."""
241,II,
242,II,Or; --
243,II,
244,II,"""And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;"
245,II,"And see, no longer blinded by our eyes,"""
246,II,
247,II,"Or, more briefly, --"
248,II,
249,II,"""In wise majestic melancholy train."""
250,II,
251,II,"And this, --"
252,II,
253,II,"""And evening hush broken by homing wings,"""
254,II,
255,II,"Such lines as these, apart from their beauty, are in the best manner"
256,II,"of English poetic style.  So, in many minor ways, he shuffled"
257,II,"contrast and climax, and the like, adept in the handling"
258,II,of poetic rhetoric that he had come to be; but in three ways
259,II,he was conspicuously successful in his art.
260,II,
261,II,The first of these -- they are all in the larger forms of art --
262,II,"is the dramatic sonnet, by which I do not mean merely"
263,II,a sonnet in dialogue or advancing by simple contrast;
264,II,"but one in which there may be these things, but also there is"
265,II,"a tragic reversal or its equivalent.  Not to consider it too curiously,"
266,II,"take ""The Hill"".  This sonnet is beautiful in action and diction;"
267,II,its eloquence speeds it on with a lift; the situation is
268,II,"the very crest of life; then, --"
269,II,
270,II,"""We shall go down with unreluctant tread,"
271,II,"Rose-crowned into the darkness! . . .  Proud we were,"
272,II,"And laughed, that had such brave true things to say."
273,II,"-- And then you suddenly cried and turned away."""
274,II,
275,II,"The dramatic sonnet in English has not gone beyond that, for beauty,"
276,II,"for brevity, for tragic effect, -- nor, I add, for unspoken loyalty"
277,II,"to reality.  Reality was, perhaps, what he most dearly wished for;"
278,II,here he achieved it.  In many another sonnet he won the laurel;
279,II,"but if I were to venture to choose, it is in the dramatic handling"
280,II,of the sonnet that he is most individual and characteristic.
281,II,
282,II,"The second great success of his genius, formally considered,"
283,II,"lay in the narrative idyl, either in the Miltonic way of flashing bits"
284,II,"of English country landscape before the eye, as in ""Grantchester"","
285,II,or by applying essentially the same method to the water world of fishes
286,II,"or the South Sea world, both on a philosophic background."
287,II,"These are all master poems of a kaleidoscopic beauty and charm,"
288,II,"where the brief pictures play in and out of a woven veil of thought,"
289,II,"irony, mood, with a delightful intellectual pleasuring."
290,II,He thoroughly enjoys doing the poetical magic.  Such bits of
291,II,"English retreats or Pacific paradises, so full of idyllic charm,"
292,II,"exquisite in image and movement, are among the rarest of poetic treasures."
293,II,The thought of Milton and of Marvell only adds an old world charm
294,II,"to the most modern of the works of the Muses.  What lightness of touch,"
295,II,"what ease of movement, what brilliancy of hue!  What vivacity throughout!"
296,II,"Even in ""Retrospect"", what actuality!"
297,II,
298,II,"And the third success is what I should call the ""melange"".  That is,"
299,II,"the method of indiscrimination by which he gathers up experience,"
300,II,"and pours it out again in language, with full disregard"
301,II,of its relative values.  His good taste saves him from what in another
302,II,"would be shipwreck, but this indifference to values, this apparent lack"
303,II,"of selection in material, while at times it gives a huddled flow,"
304,II,"more than anything else ""modernizes"" the verse.  It yields, too,"
305,II,"an effect of abundant vitality, and it makes facile the change"
306,II,"from grave to gay and the like.  The ""melange"", as I call it,"
307,II,"is rather an innovation in English verse, and to be found only rarely."
308,II,"It exists, however; and especially it was dear to Keats in his youth."
309,II,"It is by excellent taste, and by style, that the poet here overcomes"
310,II,its early difficulties.
311,II,
312,II,"In these three formal ways, besides in minor matters, it appears to me"
313,II,"that Rupert Brooke, judged by the most orthodox standards,"
314,II,had succeeded in poetry.
315,II,
316,II,
317,III,III
318,III,
319,III,"But in his first notes, if I may indulge my private taste,"
320,III,I find more of the intoxication of the god.  These early poems
321,III,"are the lyrical cries and luminous flares of a dawn, no doubt;"
322,III,"but they are incarnate of youth.  Capital among them is ""Blue Evening""."
323,III,"It is original and complete.  In its whispering embraces of sense,"
324,III,"in the terror of seizure of the spirit, in the tranquil euthanasia"
325,III,"of the end by the touch of speechless beauty, it seems to me a true symbol"
326,III,"of life whole and entire.  It is beautiful in language and feeling,"
327,III,"with an extraordinary clarity and rise of power; and, above all,"
328,III,"though rare in experience, it is real.  A young poet's poem;"
329,III,"but it has a quality never captured by perfect art.  A poem for poets,"
330,III,"no doubt; but that is the best kind.  So, too, the poem,"
331,III,"entitled ""Sleeping Out"", charms me and stirs me with"
332,III,its golden clangors and crying flames of emotion as it mounts up
333,III,"to ""the white one flame"", to ""the laughter and the lips of light""."
334,III,"It is like a holy Italian picture, -- remote, inaccessible, alone."
335,III,"The ""white flame"" seems to have had a mystic meaning to the boy;"
336,III,"it occurs repeatedly.  And another poem, -- not to make"
337,III,"too long a story of my private enthusiasms -- ""Ante Aram"", --"
338,III,"wakes all my classical blood, --"
339,III,
340,III,"""voice more sweet than the far plaint of viols is,"
341,III,"Or the soft moan of any grey-eyed lute player."""
342,III,
343,III,But these things are arcana.
344,III,
345,III,
346,IV,IV
347,IV,
348,IV,"There is a grave in Scyros, amid the white and pinkish marble of the isle,"
349,IV,"the wild thyme and the poppies, near the green and blue waters."
350,IV,There Rupert Brooke was buried.  Thither have gone the thoughts
351,IV,"of his countrymen, and the hearts of the young especially."
352,IV,It will long be so.  For a new star shines in the English heavens.

1833,I,
1834,I,Hot through Troy's ruin Menelaus broke
1835,I,"To Priam's palace, sword in hand, to sate"
1836,I,On that adulterous whore a ten years' hate
1837,I,"And a king's honour.  Through red death, and smoke,"
1838,I,"And cries, and then by quieter ways he strode,"
1839,I,Till the still innermost chamber fronted him.
1840,I,"He swung his sword, and crashed into the dim"
1841,I,"Luxurious bower, flaming like a god."
1842,I,
1843,I,"High sat white Helen, lonely and serene."
1844,I,"He had not remembered that she was so fair,"
1845,I,And that her neck curved down in such a way;
1846,I,"And he felt tired.  He flung the sword away,"
1847,I,"And kissed her feet, and knelt before her there,"
1848,I,The perfect Knight before the perfect Queen.
1849,I,
1850,I,
1851,II,II
1852,II,
1853,II,So far the poet.  How should he behold
1854,II,"That journey home, the long connubial years?"
1855,II,He does not tell you how white Helen bears
1856,II,"Child on legitimate child, becomes a scold,"
1857,II,Haggard with virtue.  Menelaus bold
1858,II,"Waxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred Troys"
1859,II,'Twixt noon and supper.  And her golden voice
1860,II,Got shrill as he grew deafer.  And both were old.
1861,II,
1862,II,Often he wonders why on earth he went
1863,II,"Troyward, or why poor Paris ever came."
1864,II,"Oft she weeps, gummy-eyed and impotent;"
1865,II,Her dry shanks twitch at Paris' mumbled name.
1866,II,So Menelaus nagged; and Helen cried;
1867,II,And Paris slept on by Scamander side.

1873,II,
1874,II,
1875,II,
1876,II,How should I know?  The enormous wheels of will
1877,II,Drove me cold-eyed on tired and sleepless feet.
1878,II,"Night was void arms and you a phantom still,"
1879,II,And day your far light swaying down the street.
1880,II,"As never fool for love, I starved for you;"
1881,II,My throat was dry and my eyes hot to see.
1882,II,"Your mouth so lying was most heaven in view,"
1883,II,And your remembered smell most agony.
1884,II,
1885,II,Love wakens love!  I felt your hot wrist shiver
1886,II,And suddenly the mad victory I planned
1887,II,"Flashed real, in your burning bending head. . . ."
1888,II,My conqueror's blood was cool as a deep river
1889,II,In shadow; and my heart beneath your hand
1890,II,Quieter than a dead man on a bed.

1897,II,
1898,II,
1899,II,"When I see you, who were so wise and cool,"
1900,II,Gazing with silly sickness on that fool
1901,II,"You've given your love to, your adoring hands"
1902,II,"Touch his so intimately that each understands,"
1903,II,"I know, most hidden things; and when I know"
1904,II,Your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow
1905,II,"Of his red lips, and that the empty grace"
1906,II,"Of those strong legs and arms, that rosy face,"
1907,II,"Has beaten your heart to such a flame of love,"
1908,II,"That you have given him every touch and move,"
1909,II,"Wrinkle and secret of you, all your life,"
1910,II,"-- Oh! then I know I'm waiting, lover-wife,"
1911,II,"For the great time when love is at a close,"
1912,II,And all its fruit's to watch the thickening nose
1913,II,"And sweaty neck and dulling face and eye,"
1914,II,"That are yours, and you, most surely, till you die!"
1915,II,Day after day you'll sit with him and note
1916,II,"The greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat;"
1917,II,"As prettiness turns to pomp, and strength to fat,"
1918,II,"And love, love, love to habit!"
1919,II,"And after that,"
1920,II,"When all that's fine in man is at an end,"
1921,II,"And you, that loved young life and clean, must tend"
1922,II,"A foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old,"
1923,II,When his rare lips hang flabby and can't hold
1924,II,"Slobber, and you're enduring that worst thing,"
1925,II,"Senility's queasy furtive love-making,"
1926,II,"And searching those dear eyes for human meaning,"
1927,II,"Propping the bald and helpless head, and cleaning"
1928,II,"A scrap that life's flung by, and love's forgotten, --"
1929,II,Then you'll be tired; and passion dead and rotten;
1930,II,"And he'll be dirty, dirty!"
1931,II,O lithe and free
1932,II,"And lightfoot, that the poor heart cries to see,"
1933,II,That's how I'll see your man and you! --
1934,II,
1935,II,But you
1936,II,"-- Oh, when THAT time comes, you'll be dirty too!"

1945,II,"My restless blood now lies a-quiver,"
1946,II,"Knowing that always, exquisitely,"
1947,II,This April twilight on the river
1948,II,Stirs anguish in the heart of me.
1949,II,
1950,II,For the fast world in that rare glimmer
1951,II,"Puts on the witchery of a dream,"
1952,II,"The straight grey buildings, richly dimmer,"
1953,II,"The fiery windows, and the stream"
1954,II,
1955,II,"With willows leaning quietly over,"
1956,II,The still ecstatic fading skies . . .
1957,II,"And all these, like a waiting lover,"
1958,II,"Murmur and gleam, lift lustrous eyes,"
1959,II,
1960,II,"Drift close to me, and sideways bending"
1961,II,Whisper delicious words.
1962,II,But I
1963,II,"Stretch terrible hands, uncomprehending,"
1964,II,Shaken with love; and laugh; and cry.
1965,II,
1966,II,My agony made the willows quiver;
1967,II,I heard the knocking of my heart
1968,II,"Die loudly down the windless river,"
1969,II,"I heard the pale skies fall apart,"
1970,II,
1971,II,"And the shrill stars' unmeaning laughter,"
1972,II,And my voice with the vocal trees
1973,II,"Weeping.  And Hatred followed after,"
1974,II,Shrilling madly down the breeze.
1975,II,
1976,II,"In peace from the wild heart of clamour,"
1977,II,"A flower in moonlight, she was there,"
1978,II,Was rippling down white ways of glamour
1979,II,Quietly laid on wave and air.
1980,II,
1981,II,Her passing left no leaf a-quiver.
1982,II,"Pale flowers wreathed her white, white brows."
1983,II,Her feet were silence on the river;
1984,II,"And ""Hush!"" she said, between the boughs."

1992,II,
1993,II,In darkness the loud sea makes moan;
1994,II,"And earth is shaken, and all evils creep"
1995,II,About her ways.
1996,II,"Oh, now to know you sleep!"
1997,II,"Out of the whirling blinding moil, alone,"
1998,II,"Out of the slow grim fight,"
1999,II,"One thought to wing -- to you, asleep,"
2000,II,In some cool room that's open to the night
2001,II,"Lying half-forward, breathing quietly,"
2002,II,One white hand on the white
2003,II,"Unrumpled sheet, and the ever-moving hair"
2004,II,Quiet and still at length! . . .
2005,II,
2006,II,"Your magic and your beauty and your strength,"
2007,II,"Like hills at noon or sunlight on a tree,"
2008,II,Sleeping prevail in earth and air.
2009,II,
2010,II,In the sweet gloom above the brown and white
2011,II,Night benedictions hover; and the winds of night
2012,II,"Move gently round the room, and watch you there."
2013,II,And through the dreadful hours
2014,II,The trees and waters and the hills have kept
2015,II,"The sacred vigil while you slept,"
2016,II,And lay a way of dew and flowers
2017,II,"Where your feet, your morning feet, shall tread."
2018,II,And still the darkness ebbs about your bed.
2019,II,"Quiet, and strange, and loving-kind, you sleep."
2020,II,And holy joy about the earth is shed;
2021,II,And holiness upon the deep.

2027,II,
2028,II,
2029,II,
2030,II,"From the candles and dumb shadows,"
2031,II,"And the house where love had died,"
2032,II,I stole to the vast moonlight
2033,II,And the whispering life outside.
2034,II,"But I found no lips of comfort,"
2035,II,No home in the moon's light
2036,II,"(I, little and lone and frightened"
2037,II,"In the unfriendly night),"
2038,II,And no meaning in the voices. . . .
2039,II,Far over the lands and through
2040,II,"The dark, beyond the ocean,"
2041,II,I willed to think of YOU!
2042,II,"For I knew, had you been with me"
2043,II,"I'd have known the words of night,"
2044,II,"Found peace of heart, gone gladly"
2045,II,In comfort of that light.
2046,II,
2047,II,Oh! the wind with soft beguiling
2048,II,Would have stolen my thought away;
2049,II,"And the night, subtly smiling,"
2050,II,Came by the silver way;
2051,II,"And the moon came down and danced to me,"
2052,II,And her robe was white and flying;
2053,II,And trees bent their heads to me
2054,II,Mysteriously crying;
2055,II,And dead voices wept around me;
2056,II,And dead soft fingers thrilled;
2057,II,And the little gods whispered. . . .
2058,II,But ever
2059,II,Desperately I willed;
2060,II,Till all grew soft and far
2061,II,And silent . . .
2062,II,And suddenly
2063,II,"I found you white and radiant,"
2064,II,"Sleeping quietly,"
2065,II,Far out through the tides of darkness.
2066,II,And I there in that great light
2067,II,"Was alone no more, nor fearful;"
2068,II,"For there, in the homely night,"
2069,II,"Was no thought else that mattered,"
2070,II,"And nothing else was true,"
2071,II,"But the white fire of moonlight,"
2072,II,And a white dream of you.

2081,II,"""Oh! Love,"" they said, ""is King of Kings,"
2082,II,And Triumph is his crown.
2083,II,"Earth fades in flame before his wings,"
2084,II,"And Sun and Moon bow down."" --"
2085,II,"But that, I knew, would never do;"
2086,II,And Heaven is all too high.
2087,II,"So whenever I meet a Queen, I said,"
2088,II,I will not catch her eye.
2089,II,
2090,II,"""Oh! Love,"" they said, and ""Love,"" they said,"
2091,II,"""The gift of Love is this;"
2092,II,"A crown of thorns about thy head,"
2093,II,"And vinegar to thy kiss!"" --"
2094,II,But Tragedy is not for me;
2095,II,And I'm content to be gay.
2096,II,"So whenever I spied a Tragic Lady,"
2097,II,I went another way.
2098,II,
2099,II,And so I never feared to see
2100,II,"You wander down the street,"
2101,II,Or come across the fields to me
2102,II,On ordinary feet.
2103,II,"For what they'd never told me of,"
2104,II,And what I never knew;
2105,II,"It was that all the time, my love,"
2106,II,Love would be merely you.

2111,II,The Voice
2112,II,
2113,II,
2114,II,
2115,II,Safe in the magic of my woods
2116,II,"I lay, and watched the dying light."
2117,II,"Faint in the pale high solitudes,"
2118,II,"And washed with rain and veiled by night,"
2119,II,
2120,II,Silver and blue and green were showing.
2121,II,And the dark woods grew darker still;
2122,II,And birds were hushed; and peace was growing;
2123,II,And quietness crept up the hill;
2124,II,
2125,II,And no wind was blowing
2126,II,
2127,II,And I knew
2128,II,"That this was the hour of knowing,"
2129,II,And the night and the woods and you
2130,II,"Were one together, and I should find"
2131,II,Soon in the silence the hidden key
2132,II,Of all that had hurt and puzzled me --
2133,II,"Why you were you, and the night was kind,"
2134,II,And the woods were part of the heart of me.
2135,II,
2136,II,"And there I waited breathlessly,"
2137,II,"Alone; and slowly the holy three,"
2138,II,"The three that I loved, together grew"
2139,II,"One, in the hour of knowing,"
2140,II,"Night, and the woods, and you ----"
2141,II,
2142,II,And suddenly
2143,II,"There was an uproar in my woods,"
2144,II,
2145,II,"The noise of a fool in mock distress,"
2146,II,"Crashing and laughing and blindly going,"
2147,II,"Of ignorant feet and a swishing dress,"
2148,II,And a Voice profaning the solitudes.
2149,II,
2150,II,"The spell was broken, the key denied me"
2151,II,And at length your flat clear voice beside me
2152,II,Mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes.
2153,II,
2154,II,You came and quacked beside me in the wood.
2155,II,"You said, ""The view from here is very good!"""
2156,II,"You said, ""It's nice to be alone a bit!"""
2157,II,"And, ""How the days are drawing out!"" you said."
2158,II,"You said, ""The sunset's pretty, isn't it?"""

2171,II,"When you were there, and you, and you,"
2172,II,"Happiness crowned the night; I too,"
2173,II,"Laughing and looking, one of all,"
2174,II,I watched the quivering lamplight fall
2175,II,On plate and flowers and pouring tea
2176,II,And cup and cloth; and they and we
2177,II,Flung all the dancing moments by
2178,II,With jest and glitter.  Lip and eye
2179,II,"Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,"
2180,II,"Improvident, unmemoried;"
2181,II,And fitfully and like a flame
2182,II,The light of laughter went and came.
2183,II,Proud in their careless transience moved
2184,II,The changing faces that I loved.
2185,II,
2186,II,"Till suddenly, and otherwhence,"
2187,II,I looked upon your innocence.
2188,II,For lifted clear and still and strange
2189,II,From the dark woven flow of change
2190,II,Under a vast and starless sky
2191,II,I saw the immortal moment lie.
2192,II,"One instant I, an instant, knew"
2193,II,As God knows all.  And it and you
2194,II,"I, above Time, oh, blind! could see"
2195,II,In witless immortality.
2196,II,"I saw the marble cup; the tea,"
2197,II,"Hung on the air, an amber stream;"
2198,II,"I saw the fire's unglittering gleam,"
2199,II,"The painted flame, the frozen smoke."
2200,II,No more the flooding lamplight broke
2201,II,On flying eyes and lips and hair;
2202,II,"But lay, but slept unbroken there,"
2203,II,"On stiller flesh, and body breathless,"
2204,II,"And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,"
2205,II,And words on which no silence grew.
2206,II,Light was more alive than you.
2207,II,
2208,II,"For suddenly, and otherwhence,"
2209,II,I looked on your magnificence.
2210,II,"I saw the stillness and the light,"
2211,II,"And you, august, immortal, white,"
2212,II,Holy and strange; and every glint
2213,II,Posture and jest and thought and tint
2214,II,"Freed from the mask of transiency,"
2215,II,"Triumphant in eternity,"
2216,II,"Immote, immortal."
2217,II,
2218,II,Dazed at length
2219,II,"Human eyes grew, mortal strength"
2220,II,Wearied; and Time began to creep.
2221,II,Change closed about me like a sleep.
2222,II,Light glinted on the eyes I loved.
2223,II,The cup was filled.  The bodies moved.
2224,II,The drifting petal came to ground.
2225,II,The laughter chimed its perfect round.
2226,II,The broken syllable was ended.
2227,II,"And I, so certain and so friended,"
2228,II,"How could I cloud, or how distress,"
2229,II,The heaven of your unconsciousness?
2230,II,"Or shake at Time's sufficient spell,"
2231,II,Stammering of lights unutterable?
2232,II,"The eternal holiness of you,"
2233,II,"The timeless end, you never knew,"
2234,II,"The peace that lay, the light that shone."
2235,II,You never knew that I had gone
2236,II,"A million miles away, and stayed"
2237,II,A million years.  The laughter played
2238,II,Unbroken round me; and the jest
2239,II,Flashed on.  And we that knew the best
2240,II,Down wonderful hours grew happier yet.
2241,II,"I sang at heart, and talked, and eat,"
2242,II,"And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,"
2243,II,"When you were there, and you, and you."

2253,II,Amazed with sorrow.  Down the morning one
2254,II,Far golden horn in the gold of trees and sun
2255,II,Rang out; and held; and died. . . .  She thought the wood
2256,II,"Grew quieter.  Wing, and leaf, and pool of light"
2257,II,Forgot to dance.  Dumb lay the unfalling stream;
2258,II,Life one eternal instant rose in dream
2259,II,"Clear out of time, poised on a golden height. . . ."
2260,II,
2261,II,Till a swift terror broke the abrupt hour.
2262,II,The gold waves purled amidst the green above her;
2263,II,"And a bird sang.  With one sharp-taken breath,"
2264,II,"By sunlit branches and unshaken flower,"
2265,II,"The immortal limbs flashed to the human lover,"
2266,II,And the immortal eyes to look on death.

2273,II,

2275,II,The damned ship lurched and slithered.  Quiet and quick
2276,II,My cold gorge rose; the long sea rolled; I knew
2277,II,"I must think hard of something, or be sick;"
2278,II,And could think hard of only one thing -- YOU!
2279,II,"You, you alone could hold my fancy ever!"
2280,II,"And with you memories come, sharp pain, and dole."
2281,II,Now there's a choice -- heartache or tortured liver!
2282,II,"A sea-sick body, or a you-sick soul!"
2283,II,
2284,II,"Do I forget you?  Retchings twist and tie me,"

2761,II,"Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming. . . ."
2762,II,These I have loved:
2763,II,"White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,"
2764,II,"Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;"
2765,II,"Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust"
2766,II,Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
2767,II,Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
2768,II,And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
2769,II,"And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,"
2770,II,Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
2771,II,"Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon"
2772,II,Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
2773,II,Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
2774,II,Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
2775,II,Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
2776,II,The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
2777,II,The good smell of old clothes; and other such --
2778,II,"The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,"
2779,II,"Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers"
2780,II,About dead leaves and last year's ferns. . . .
2781,II,"Dear names,"
2782,II,And thousand other throng to me!  Royal flames;
2783,II,Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;
2784,II,Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;
2785,II,"Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,"
2786,II,Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;
2787,II,Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam
2788,II,That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;
2789,II,"And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold"
2790,II,Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;
2791,II,Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;
2792,II,"And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;"
2793,II,And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass; --
2794,II,"All these have been my loves.  And these shall pass,"
2795,II,"Whatever passes not, in the great hour,"
2796,II,"Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power"
2797,II,To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
2798,II,"They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,"

3248,II,
3249,II,I came back late and tired last night
3250,II,"Into my little room,"
3251,II,To the long chair and the firelight
3252,II,And comfortable gloom.
3253,II,
3254,II,But as I entered softly in
3255,II,"I saw a woman there,"
3256,II,"The line of neck and cheek and chin,"
3257,II,"The darkness of her hair,"
3258,II,The form of one I did not know
3259,II,Sitting in my chair.
3260,II,
3261,II,"I stood a moment fierce and still,"
3262,II,Watching her neck and hair.
3263,II,I made a step to her; and saw
3264,II,That there was no one there.
3265,II,
3266,II,It was some trick of the firelight
3267,II,That made me see her there.
3268,II,It was a chance of shade and light
3269,II,And the cushion in the chair.
3270,II,
3271,II,"Oh, all you happy over the earth,"
3272,II,"That night, how could I sleep?"
3273,II,I lay and watched the lonely gloom;
3274,II,And watched the moonlight creep
3275,II,"From wall to basin, round the room,"
3276,II,All night I could not sleep.

3281,II,The Night Journey
3282,II,
3283,II,
3284,II,
3285,II,Hands and lit faces eddy to a line;
3286,II,The dazed last minutes click; the clamour dies.
3287,II,"Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,"
3288,II,"Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes"
3289,II,
3290,II,Glares the imperious mystery of the way.
3291,II,"Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed train"
3292,II,"Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway,"
3293,II,"Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again. . . ."
3294,II,
3295,II,"As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,"
3296,II,"Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;"
3297,II,"And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,"
3298,II,"Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move"
3299,II,
3300,II,"Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;"
3301,II,"And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,"
3302,II,"Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,"
3303,II,"Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,"
3304,II,
3305,II,"Sweep out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,"
3306,II,"Out of the fire, out of the little room. . . ."
3307,II,"-- There is an end appointed, O my soul!"
3308,II,Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom
3309,II,
3310,II,Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.
3311,II,"Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,"
3312,II,"Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers."
3313,II,The white lights roar.  The sounds of the world die.
3314,II,
3315,II,And lips and laughter are forgotten things.
3316,II,"Speed sharpens; grows.  Into the night, and on,"
3317,II,The strength and splendour of our purpose swings.
3318,II,The lamps fade; and the stars.  We are alone.

3329,II,"And the hawthorn quickens with buds of green,"
3330,II,And my heart with buds of pain.
3331,II,
3332,II,"My heart all Winter lay so numb,"
3333,II,"The earth so dead and frore,"
3334,II,"That I never thought the Spring would come,"
3335,II,Or my heart wake any more.
3336,II,
3337,II,"But Winter's broken and earth has woken,"
3338,II,And the small birds cry again;
3339,II,"And the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds,"
3340,II,And my heart puts forth its pain.

3374,II,The way that lovers use is this;
3375,II,"They bow, catch hands, with never a word,"
3376,II,"And their lips meet, and they do kiss,"
3377,II,-- So I have heard.
3378,II,
3379,II,"They queerly find some healing so,"
3380,II,And strange attainment in the touch;
3381,II,"There is a secret lovers know,"
3382,II,-- I have read as much.
3383,II,
3384,II,"And theirs no longer joy nor smart,"
3385,II,"Changing or ending, night or day;"
3386,II,"But mouth to mouth, and heart on heart,"
3387,II,-- So lovers say.

3398,II,"As wine that blushes water through.  And soon,"
3399,II,"Out of the gold air of the afternoon,"
3400,II,"One knelt before her:  hair he had, or fire,"
3401,II,"Bound back above his ears with golden wire,"
3402,II,Baring the eager marble of his face.
3403,II,Not man's nor woman's was the immortal grace
3404,II,"Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white,"
3405,II,"And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light,"
3406,II,"Incurious.  Calm as his wings, and fair,"
3407,II,That presence filled the garden.
3408,II,"She stood there,"
3409,II,"Saying, ""What would you, Sir?"""
3410,II,"He told his word,"
3411,II,"""Blessed art thou of women!""  Half she heard,"
3412,II,"Hands folded and face bowed, half long had known,"
3413,II,"The message of that clear and holy tone,"
3414,II,That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart;
3415,II,Such serene tidings moved such human smart.
3416,II,Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow.
3417,II,Her hands crept up her breast.  She did but know
3418,II,It was not hers.  She felt a trembling stir
3419,II,"Within her body, a will too strong for her"
3420,II,That held and filled and mastered all.  With eyes
3421,II,"Closed, and a thousand soft short broken sighs,"
3422,II,"She gave submission; fearful, meek, and glad. . . ."
3423,II,
3424,II,She wished to speak.  Under her breasts she had
3425,II,"Such multitudinous burnings, to and fro,"
3426,II,And throbs not understood; she did not know
3427,II,If they were hurt or joy for her; but only
3428,II,"That she was grown strange to herself, half lonely,"
3429,II,"All wonderful, filled full of pains to come"
3430,II,"And thoughts she dare not think, swift thoughts and dumb,"
3431,II,"Human, and quaint, her own, yet very far,"
3432,II,"Divine, dear, terrible, familiar . . ."
3433,II,Her heart was faint for telling; to relate
3434,II,"Her limbs' sweet treachery, her strange high estate,"
3435,II,"Over and over, whispering, half revealing,"
3436,II,Weeping; and so find kindness to her healing.
3437,II,"'Twixt tears and laughter, panic hurrying her,"
3438,II,She raised her eyes to that fair messenger.
3439,II,"He knelt unmoved, immortal; with his eyes"
3440,II,"Gazing beyond her, calm to the calm skies;"
3441,II,"Radiant, untroubled in his wisdom, kind."
3442,II,His sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind.
3443,II,"How should she, pitiful with mortality,"
3444,II,Try the wide peace of that felicity
3445,II,"With ripples of her perplexed shaken heart,"
3446,II,"And hints of human ecstasy, human smart,"
3447,II,"And whispers of the lonely weight she bore,"
3448,II,And how her womb within was hers no more
3449,II,And at length hers?
3450,II,"Being tired, she bowed her head;"
3451,II,"And said, ""So be it!"""
3452,II,The great wings were spread
3453,II,"Showering glory on the fields, and fire."
3454,II,"The whole air, singing, bore him up, and higher,"
3455,II,"Unswerving, unreluctant.  Soon he shone"
3456,II,A gold speck in the gold skies; then was gone.

3475,II,"When YOUTH kept open house,"
3476,II,Nor left untasted
3477,II,"Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,"
3478,II,No quest of his unshar'd --
3479,II,"All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar'd,"
3480,II,Followed their old friend's bier.
3481,II,"FOLLY went first,"

3490,II,"""Had he but wed"
3491,II,"Her elder sister SORROW, in her stead!"""
3492,II,"And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,"

3501,II,"Dead INNOCENCY's daughter, IGNORANCE;"
3502,II,"And shabby, ill-dress'd GENEROSITY;"

3726,NOTE,The Appendix contains: (1) the only two coherent fragments found in the
3727,NOTE,"notebook which Brooke used in the last month of his life; a little song,"
3728,NOTE,"written, I think on his travels; and a poem, dating probably from 1912,"
3729,NOTE,"which for some reason he left unrevised; (2) a few ""lighter"" poems which"
3730,NOTE,I dare say he would have printed on their merits if he had published a
3731,NOTE,"volume in which they would not have been out of key.  Two of these, the"
3732,NOTE,"""Letter to a Live Poet"" and ""The Little Dog's Day,"" were written for"

3872,NOTE,"Blind with much light, passed to the light more glorious"
3873,NOTE,"Or deeper blindness, no man's hand, as thine,"
3874,NOTE,"Has, on the world's most noblest chord of song,"

3876,NOTE,"With the clamorous, timorous whisperings of to-day,"
3877,NOTE,Thrilled to perceive once more the spacious voice
3878,NOTE,And serene utterance of old. We heard
3879,NOTE,"--With rapturous breath half-held, as a dreamer dreams"
3880,NOTE,"Who dares not know it dreaming, lest he wake--"
3881,NOTE,"The odorous, amorous style of poetry,"
3882,NOTE,"The melancholy knocking of those lines,"
3883,NOTE,"The long, low soughing of pentameters,"
3884,NOTE,--Or the sharp of rhyme as a bird's cry--
3885,NOTE,And the innumerable truant polysyllables
3886,NOTE,Multitudinously twittering like a bee.

4072,NOTE,Rupert Brooke:  A Biographical Note
4073,NOTE,
4074,NOTE,
4075,NOTE,
4076,NOTE,Any biographical account of Rupert Brooke must of necessity be brief;
4077,NOTE,"yet it is well to know the facts of his romantic career,"
4078,NOTE,and to see him as far as may be through the eyes of those who knew him
4079,NOTE,(the writer was unfortunately not of this number) in order the better
4080,NOTE,to appreciate his work.
4081,NOTE,
4082,NOTE,"He was born at Rugby on August 3, 1887, his father, William Brooke,"
4083,NOTE,"being an assistant master at the school.  Here Brooke was educated,"
4084,NOTE,"and in 1905 won a prize for a poem called ""The Bastille"","
4085,NOTE,"which has been described as ""fine, fluent stuff.""  He took a keen interest"
4086,NOTE,"in every form of athletic sport, and played both cricket and football"
4087,NOTE,"for the school.  Though he afterwards dropped both these games,"
4088,NOTE,"he developed as a sound tennis player, was a great walker, and found joy"
4089,NOTE,"in swimming, like Byron and Swinburne, especially by night.  He delighted"
4090,NOTE,in the Russian ballet and went again and again to a good Revue.
4091,NOTE,
4092,NOTE,"In 1906 he went up to King's College, Cambridge, where he made"
4093,NOTE,"innumerable friends, and was considered one of the leading intellectuals"
4094,NOTE,"of his day, among his peers being James Elroy Flecker,"
4095,NOTE,"himself a poet of no small achievement, who died at Davos"
4096,NOTE,"only a few months ago.  Mr. Ivan Lake, the editor of the 'Bodleian',"
4097,NOTE,"a contemporary at Cambridge, tells me that although the two men"
4098,NOTE,"moved in different sets, they frequented the same literary circles."
4099,NOTE,"Brooke, however, seldom, if ever, spoke at the Union,"
4100,NOTE,"but was a member of the Cambridge Fabian Society, and held the posts"
4101,NOTE,of Secretary and President in turn.  His socialism was accompanied by
4102,NOTE,"a passing phase of vegetarianism, and with the ferment of youth"
4103,NOTE,working headily within him he could hardly escape the charge
4104,NOTE,"of being a crank, but ""a crank, if a little thing, makes revolutions,"""
4105,NOTE,and Brooke's youthful extravagances were utterly untinged with decadence.
4106,NOTE,"He took his classical tripos in 1909, and after spending some time"
4107,NOTE,"as a student in Munich, returned to live near Cambridge"
4108,NOTE,"at the Old Vicarage in ""the lovely hamlet, Grantchester.""  ""It was there,"""
4109,NOTE,"writes Mr. Raglan H. E. H. Somerset in a letter I am privileged to quote,"
4110,NOTE,"""that I used to wake him on Sunday mornings to bathe in the dam"
4111,NOTE,"above Byron's Pool.  His bedroom was always littered with books,"
4112,NOTE,"English, French, and German, in wild disorder.  About his bathing"
4113,NOTE,one thing stands out; time after time he would try to dive;
4114,NOTE,"he always failed and came absolutely flat, but seemed to like it,"
4115,NOTE,"although it must have hurt excessively.""  (This was only"
4116,NOTE,when he was learning.  Later he became an accomplished diver.)
4117,NOTE,"""Then we used to go back and feed, sometimes in the Orchard and sometimes"
4118,NOTE,"in the Old Vicarage Garden, on eggs and that particular brand of honey"
4119,NOTE,referred to in the 'Grantchester' poem.  In those days he always dressed
4120,NOTE,"in the same way:  cricket shirt and trousers and no stockings; in fact,"
4121,NOTE,"'Rupert's mobile toes' were a subject for the admiration of his friends."""
4122,NOTE,
4123,NOTE,"Brooke occupied himself mainly with writing.  Poems, remarkable for"
4124,NOTE,"a happy spontaneity such as characterized the work of T. E. Brown,"
4125,NOTE,"the Manx poet, appeared in the 'Gownsman', the 'Cambridge Review',"
4126,NOTE,"the 'Nation', the 'English Review', and the 'Westminster Gazette'."
4127,NOTE,"Students of the ""Problem Page"" in the 'Saturday Westminster'"
4128,NOTE,knew him as a brilliant competitor who infused the purely academic
4129,NOTE,with the very spirit of youth.
4130,NOTE,
4131,NOTE,"To all who knew him, the man himself was at least as important as his work."
4132,NOTE,"""As to his talk"" -- I quote again from Mr. Somerset --"
4133,NOTE,"""he was a spendthrift.  I mean that he never saved anything up"
4134,NOTE,as those writer fellows so often do.  He was quite inconsequent
4135,NOTE,"and just rippled on, but was always ready to attack a careless thinker."
4136,NOTE,"On the other hand, he was extremely tolerant of fools, even bad poets"
4137,NOTE,who are the worst kind of fools -- or rather the hardest to bear --
4138,NOTE,"but that was kindness of heart."""
4139,NOTE,
4140,NOTE,"Of his personal appearance a good deal has been said.  ""One who knew him,"""
4141,NOTE,"writing in one of the daily papers, said that ""to look at, he was part"
4142,NOTE,of the youth of the world.  He was one of the handsomest Englishmen
4143,NOTE,of his time.  His moods seemed to be merely a disguise for the radiance
4144,NOTE,"of an early summer's day."""
4145,NOTE,
4146,NOTE,"Mr. Edward Thomas speaks of him as ""a golden young Apollo"""
4147,NOTE,"who made friends, admirers, adorers, wherever he went."
4148,NOTE,"""He stretched himself out, drew his fingers through his waved fair hair,"
4149,NOTE,"laughed, talked indolently, and admired as much as he was admired. . . ."
4150,NOTE,"He was tall, broad, and easy in his movements.  Either he stooped,"
4151,NOTE,or he thrust his head forward unusually much to look at you
4152,NOTE,"with his steady blue eyes."""
4153,NOTE,
4154,NOTE,"On Mr. H. W. Nevinson, who, in a fleeting editorial capacity, sent for"
4155,NOTE,"Brooke to come and discuss his poems, he made a similar impression:"
4156,NOTE,
4157,NOTE,"""Suddenly he came -- an astonishing apparition in any newspaper office:"
4158,NOTE,"loose hair of deep, browny-gold; smooth, ruddy face;"
4159,NOTE,"eyes not gray or bluish-white, but of living blue, really like the sky,"
4160,NOTE,"and as frankly open; figure not very tall, but firm and strongly made,"
4161,NOTE,giving the sense of weight rather than of speed and yet
4162,NOTE,so finely fashioned and healthy that it was impossible not to think

4164,NOTE,"just in the ordinary way, except that he wore a low blue collar,"
4165,NOTE,"and blue shirt and tie, all uncommon in those days."
4166,NOTE,"Evidently he did not want to be conspicuous, but the whole effect"
4167,NOTE,"was almost ludicrously beautiful."""
4168,NOTE,
4169,NOTE,"Notions of height are always comparative, and it will be noticed"
4170,NOTE,that Mr. Nevinson and Mr. Thomas differ in their ideas.
4171,NOTE,"Mr. Edward Marsh, however, Brooke's executor and one of his"
4172,NOTE,closest friends -- indeed the friend of all young poets --
4173,NOTE,"tells me that he was about six feet, so that all doubt on this minor point"
4174,NOTE,may be set at rest.
4175,NOTE,
4176,NOTE,"He had been in Munich, Berlin, and in Italy, and in May, 1913,"
4177,NOTE,"he left England again for a wander year, passing through"
4178,NOTE,the United States and Canada on his way to the South Seas.
4179,NOTE,Perhaps some of those who met him in Boston and elsewhere
4180,NOTE,will some day contribute their quota to the bright record of his life.
4181,NOTE,"His own letters to the 'Westminster Gazette', though naturally"
4182,NOTE,"of unequal merit, were full of humorous delight in the New World."
4183,NOTE,In one of his travel papers he described the city of Quebec as having
4184,NOTE,"""the radiance and repose of an immortal.""  ""That, in so many words,"""
4185,NOTE,"wrote Mr. Walter de la Mare, ""brings back his living remembrance. . . ."
4186,NOTE,With him there was a happy shining impression that he might have just come
4187,NOTE,"-- that very moment -- from another planet, one well within"
4188,NOTE,"the solar system, but a little more like Utopia than ours."""
4189,NOTE,"Not even Stevenson, it would seem, excited a greater enthusiasm"
4190,NOTE,among his friends; and between the two men an interesting parallel
4191,NOTE,"might be drawn.  Brooke made a pilgrimage to Stevenson's home in Samoa,"
4192,NOTE,and his life in the Pacific found full and happy expression in his verse.
4193,NOTE,"His thoughts, however, turned longingly to England,"
4194,NOTE,"the land ""where Men with Splendid Hearts may go,"" and he reappeared"
4195,NOTE,from the ends of the earth among his friends as apparently little changed
4196,NOTE,"""as one who gaily and laughingly goes to bed and gaily and laughingly"
4197,NOTE,"comes down next morning after a perfectly refreshing sleep."""
4198,NOTE,
4199,NOTE,"Then came the War.  ""Well, if Armageddon's ON,"" he said,"
4200,NOTE,"""I suppose one should be there.""  It was a characteristic way"
4201,NOTE,of putting it.  He obtained a commission in the Hood Battalion
4202,NOTE,"of the Royal Naval Division in September, and was quickly ordered"
4203,NOTE,on the disastrous if heroic expedition to Antwerp.  Here he had
4204,NOTE,"his first experience of war, lying for some days in trenches"
4205,NOTE,shelled by the distant German guns.  Then followed a strange retreat
4206,NOTE,"by night along roads lit by the glare of burning towns,"
4207,NOTE,and swarming with pitiful crowds of Belgian refugees.
4208,NOTE,"Yet as Mr. Walter de la Mare said of him, when he returned from Antwerp,"
4209,NOTE,"""Ulysses himself at the end of his voyagings was not more quietly"
4210,NOTE,"accustomed to the shocks of novelty."""
4211,NOTE,
4212,NOTE,"On Brooke, as on many other young men, to whom the gift of self-expression"
4213,NOTE,"has perhaps been denied, the war had a swiftly maturing influence."
4214,NOTE,Much of the impetuosity of youth fell away from him.  The boy who had been
4215,NOTE,rather proud of his independent views -- a friend relates how
4216,NOTE,at the age of twelve he sat on the platform at a pro-Boer meeting --
4217,NOTE,"grew suddenly, it seemed, into a man filled with the love of life indeed,"
4218,NOTE,but inspired most of all with the love of England.  Fortunately for himself
4219,NOTE,"and for us, Brooke's patriotism found passionate voice in the sonnets"
4220,NOTE,which are rightly given pride of place in the 1914 section of this volume.
4221,NOTE,"Mr. Clement Shorter, who gives us the skeleton of a bibliography"
4222,NOTE,"that is all too brief, draws special attention to 'New Numbers',"
4223,NOTE,"a quarterly publication issued in Gloucestershire,"
4224,NOTE,"to which Brooke contributed in February, April, August, and December"
4225,NOTE,"of last year, his fellow poets being Lascelles Abercrombie,"
4226,NOTE,"John Drinkwater, and Wilfrid Wilson Gibson.  He spent the winter"
4227,NOTE,"in training at Blandford Camp in Dorsetshire, and sailed with"
4228,NOTE,the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force on the last day of February.
4229,NOTE,"He had a presentiment of his death, but he went, as so many others"
4230,NOTE,"have gone,"

4238,NOTE,He never reached the Dardanelles.  He went first to Lemnos
4239,NOTE,and then to Egypt.  Early in April he had a touch of sunstroke
4240,NOTE,from which he recovered; but he died from blood-poisoning on board
4241,NOTE,"a French hospital ship at Scyros on Friday, April 23rd -- died for England"
4242,NOTE,"on the day of St. Michael and Saint George.  He was buried at night,"
4243,NOTE,"by torchlight, in an olive grove about a mile inland.  ""If you go there,"""

4248,NOTE,
4249,NOTE,"""W. S. C."" writes:  ""Rupert Brooke is dead.  A telegram from the Admiral"
4250,NOTE,at Lemnos tells us that this life has closed at the moment when it seemed
4251,NOTE,"to have reached its springtime.  A voice had become audible,"
4252,NOTE,"a note had been struck, more true, more thrilling, more able to do justice"
4253,NOTE,"to the nobility of our youth in arms engaged in this present war,"
4254,NOTE,"than any other -- more able to express their thoughts of self-surrender,"
4255,NOTE,and with a power to carry comfort to those who watch them so intently
4256,NOTE,from afar.  The voice has been swiftly stilled.  Only the echoes
4257,NOTE,and the memory remain; but they will linger.
4258,NOTE,
4259,NOTE,"""During the last few months of his life, months of preparation"
4260,NOTE,"in gallant comradeship and open air, the poet-soldier told"
4261,NOTE,"with all the simple force of genius the sorrow of youth about to die,"
4262,NOTE,"and the sure, triumphant consolations of a sincere and valiant spirit."
4263,NOTE,He expected to die; he was willing to die for the dear England
4264,NOTE,whose beauty and majesty he knew; and he advanced toward the brink
4265,NOTE,"in perfect serenity, with absolute conviction of the rightness"
4266,NOTE,of his country's cause and a heart devoid of hate for fellowmen.
4267,NOTE,
4268,NOTE,"""The thoughts to which he gave expression in the very few incomparable"

4294,NOTE,"that are in his work will pass safely to the memory of posterity."""
4295,NOTE,Mr. Wilfrid Gibson's tribute took the form of a short poem
4296,NOTE,"called ""The Going"":"
4297,NOTE,
4298,NOTE,He's gone.
4299,NOTE,I do not understand.
4300,NOTE,I only know
4301,NOTE,"That, as he turned to go"
4302,NOTE,"And waved his hand,"
4303,NOTE,"In his young eyes a sudden glory shone,"
4304,NOTE,And I was dazzled by a sunset glow --
4305,NOTE,And he was gone.
4306,NOTE,
4307,NOTE,"Mr. Lascelles Abercrombie, now perhaps the greatest of our younger poets"
4308,NOTE,"and a warm personal friend of Brooke's, wrote at greater length:"
4309,NOTE,
4310,NOTE,"""'And the worst friend and enemy is but Death' . . .  'And if these"
4311,NOTE,"poor limbs die, safest of all.'  So ended two of the five sonnets,"
4312,NOTE,"with the common title '1914', which Rupert Brooke wrote"
4313,NOTE,"while he was in training, between the Antwerp expedition and sailing"
4314,NOTE,for the Aegean.  These sonnets are incomparably the finest utterance
4315,NOTE,of English poetry concerning the Great War.  We knew the splendid promise
4316,NOTE,of Rupert Brooke's earlier poetry; these sonnets are the brief perfection
4317,NOTE,of his achievement.  They are much more than that:  they are among
4318,NOTE,"the few supreme utterances of English patriotism.  It was natural, perhaps,"
4319,NOTE,that they should leave all else that has been written about the war
4320,NOTE,so far behind.  It is not so much that they are the work of a talent
4321,NOTE,"scarcely, in its own way, to be equalled to-day; it was much more"
4322,NOTE,that they were the work of a poet who had for his material the feeling
4323,NOTE,that he was giving up everything to fight for England --
4324,NOTE,"the feeling, I think, that he was giving his life for England."
4325,NOTE,"Reading these five sonnets now, it seems as if he had in them written"
4326,NOTE,his own epitaph.  I believe he thought so himself; a few words he said
4327,NOTE,"in my last talk with him makes me believe that -- now.  At any rate,"
4328,NOTE,"the history of literature, so full of Fate's exquisite ironies,"
4329,NOTE,"has nothing more poignantly ironic, and nothing at the same time"
4330,NOTE,"more beautifully appropriate, than the publication of Rupert Brooke's"
4331,NOTE,"noble sonnet-sequence, '1914', a few swift weeks before the death"
4332,NOTE,"they had imagined, and had already made lovely.  Each one of these"
4333,NOTE,"five sonnets faces, in a quiet exultation, the thought of death,"
4334,NOTE,"of death for England; and understands, as seldom even English poetry"
4335,NOTE,"has understood, the unspeakable beauty of the thought:"
4336,NOTE,
4337,NOTE,"""These laid the world away; poured out the red"
4338,NOTE,Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be
4339,NOTE,"Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene"
4340,NOTE,"That men call age; and those who would have been,"
4341,NOTE,"Their sons, they gave -- their immortality."
4342,NOTE,
4343,NOTE,I am strangely mistaken if the accent of the noblest English poetry
4344,NOTE,does not speak to us in those lines.  And again:
4345,NOTE,
4346,NOTE,"""If I should die, think only this of me:"
4347,NOTE,That there's some corner of a foreign field
4348,NOTE,That is for ever England.  There shall be
4349,NOTE,In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
4350,NOTE,"A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,"
4351,NOTE,"Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,"
4352,NOTE,"A body of England's breathing, breathing English air,"
4353,NOTE,"Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home."
4354,NOTE,
4355,NOTE,"""This -- this music, this beauty, this courage -- was Rupert Brooke."
4356,NOTE,"But it is, we may be sure, his immortality.  It is not yet tolerable"
4357,NOTE,to speak of personal loss.  The name seemed to stand for a magical vitality
4358,NOTE,"that must be safe -- safe!  Yes, 'and if these poor limbs die,"
4359,NOTE,safest of all!'  What poetry has lost in him cannot be judged by any one
4360,NOTE,"who has not read those last sonnets, now his farewell to England"
4361,NOTE,and the world.  I am not underrating the rest of his work.
4362,NOTE,"There was an intellectual keenness and brightness in it, a fire of imagery"
4363,NOTE,"and (in the best sense) wit, the like of which had not been known,"
4364,NOTE,"or known only in snatches, in our literature since the best days of"
4365,NOTE,"the later Elizabethans.  And it was all penetrated by a mastering passion,"
4366,NOTE,the most elemental of all passions -- the passion for life.
4367,NOTE,"'I have been so great a lover,' he cries, and artfully leads us on"
4368,NOTE,to think he means the usual passion of a young poet's career.
4369,NOTE,"But it is just life he loves, and not in any abstract sense,"
4370,NOTE,but all the infinite little familiar details of life catalogued
4371,NOTE,with delighted jest.  This was profoundly sincere:  no one ever loved life
4372,NOTE,"more wholly or more minutely.  And he celebrated his love exquisitely,"
4373,NOTE,"often unforgettably, through all his earlier poetry,"
4374,NOTE,getting further intensity from a long sojourn in the South Seas.
4375,NOTE,But this passion for life had never had seriously to fight for
4376,NOTE,"its rights and joys.  Like all great lovers of life, he had pleased himself"
4377,NOTE,"with the thought of death and after death:  not insincerely, by any means,"
4378,NOTE,but simply because this gave a finer relish to the sense of being alive.
4379,NOTE,"Platonism, which offers delightful games for such subtle wit as his,"
4380,NOTE,he especially liked to play with.  It was one more element in the life
4381,NOTE,"of here and now, the life of mortal thought and sense and spirit,"
4382,NOTE,infinitely varying and by him infinitely loved.  And then came 1914;
4383,NOTE,and his passion for life had suddenly to face the thought
4384,NOTE,of voluntary death.  But there was no struggle; for instantly
4385,NOTE,the passion for life became one with the will to die --
4386,NOTE,and now it has become death itself.  But first Rupert Brooke
4387,NOTE,had told the world once more how the passion for beautiful life
4388,NOTE,may reach its highest passion and most radiant beauty when it is
4389,NOTE,"the determination to die."""

4445,I,Its tumult of red stars exultantly
4446,I,To the cold constellations dim and high:
4447,I,And as we neared the roaring ruddy flare

4449,I,"Until you burned, a flame of ecstasy."
