1516,XV,Throws a shade of Llewellyn’s despair
1517,XV,For the hound slain for saving his child.

1531,I,"ENTER these enchanted woods,"
1532,I,You who dare.
1533,I,Nothing harms beneath the leaves
1534,I,More than waves a swimmer cleaves.
1535,I,"Toss your heart up with the lark,"
1536,I,"Foot at peace with mouse and worm,"
1537,I,Fair you fare.
1538,I,Only at a dread of dark
1539,I,"Quaver, and they quit their form:"
1540,I,Thousand eyeballs under hoods
1541,I,Have you by the hair.

1549,II,Here the snake across your path
1550,II,Stretches in his golden bath:
1551,II,Mossy-footed squirrels leap
1552,II,Soft as winnowing plumes of Sleep:
1553,II,Yaffles on a chuckle skim
1554,II,Low to laugh from branches dim:
1555,II,"Up the pine, where sits the star,"
1556,II,Rattles deep the moth-winged jar.
1557,II,Each has business of his own;
1558,II,"But should you distrust a tone,"
1559,II,Then beware.
1560,II,"Shudder all the haunted roods,"
1561,II,All the eyeballs under hoods
1562,II,Shroud you in their glare.

1570,III,"Open hither, open hence,"
1571,III,"Scarce a bramble weaves a fence,"
1572,III,"Where the strawberry runs red,"
1573,III,With white star-flower overhead;
1574,III,"Cumbered by dry twig and cone,"
1575,III,"Shredded husks of seedlings flown,"
1576,III,Mine of mole and spotted flint:
1577,III,"Of dire wizardry no hint,"
1578,III,Save mayhap the print that shows
1579,III,"Hasty outward-tripping toes,"
1580,III,Heels to terror on the mould.
1581,III,"These, the woods of Westermain,"
1582,III,"Are as others to behold,"
1583,III,Rich of wreathing sun and rain;
1584,III,Foliage lustreful around
1585,III,Shadowed leagues of slumbering sound.
1586,III,"Wavy tree-tops, yellow whins,"
1587,III,"Shelter eager minikins,"
1588,III,"Myriads, free to peck and pipe:"
1589,III,Would you better? would you worse?
1590,III,You with them may gather ripe
1591,III,Pleasures flowing not from purse.
1592,III,Quick and far as Colour flies
1593,III,"Taking the delighted eyes,"
1594,III,You of any well that springs
1595,III,May unfold the heaven of things;
1596,III,"Have it homely and within,"
1597,III,"And thereof its likeness win,"
1598,III,Will you so in soul’s desire:
1599,III,This do sages grant t’ the lyre.
1600,III,"This is being bird and more,"
1601,III,More than glad musician this;
1602,III,Granaries you will have a store
1603,III,Past the world of woe and bliss;
1604,III,Sharing still its bliss and woe;
1605,III,"Harnessed to its hungers, no."
1606,III,"On the throne Success usurps,"
1607,III,You shall seat the joy you feel
1608,III,"Where a race of water chirps,"
1609,III,Twisting hues of flourished steel:
1610,III,Or where light is caught in hoop
1611,III,"Up a clearing’s leafy rise,"
1612,III,Where the crossing deerherds troop
1613,III,"Classic splendours, knightly dyes."
1614,III,"Or, where old-eyed oxen chew"
1615,III,"Speculation with the cud,"
1616,III,"Read their pool of vision through,"
1617,III,Back to hours when mind was mud;
1618,III,"Nigh the knot, which did untwine"
1619,III,Timelessly to drowsy suns;
1620,III,"Seeing Earth a slimy spine,"
1621,III,Heaven a space for winging tons.
1622,III,"Farther, deeper, may you read,"
1623,III,"Have you sight for things afield,"
1624,III,"Where peeps she, the Nurse of seed,"
1625,III,"Cloaked, but in the peep revealed;"
1626,III,Showing a kind face and sweet:
1627,III,Look you with the soul you see’t.
1628,III,"Glory narrowing to grace,"
1629,III,"Grace to glory magnified,"
1630,III,Following that will you embrace
1631,III,Close in arms or aëry wide.
1632,III,Banished is the white Foam-born
1633,III,"Not from here, nor under ban"
1634,III,"Phoebus lyrist, Phoebe’s horn,"
1635,III,Pipings of the reedy Pan.
1636,III,"Loved of Earth of old they were,"
1637,III,Loving did interpret her;
1638,III,And the sterner worship bars
1639,III,None whom Song has made her stars.
1640,III,You have seen the huntress moon
1641,III,"Radiantly facing dawn,"
1642,III,Dusky meads between them strewn
1643,III,Glimmering like downy awn:
1644,III,"Argent Westward glows the hunt,"
1645,III,East the blush about to climb;
1646,III,"One another fair they front,"
1647,III,"Transient, yet outshine the time;"
1648,III,Even as dewlight off the rose
1649,III,In the mind a jewel sows.
1650,III,Thus opposing grandeurs live
1651,III,Here if Beauty be their dower:
1652,III,"Doth she of her spirit give,"
1653,III,Fleetingness will spare her flower.
1654,III,"This is in the tune we play,"
1655,III,Which no spring of strength would quell;
1656,III,In subduing does not slay;
1657,III,"Guides the channel, guards the well:"
1658,III,"Tempered holds the young blood-heat,"
1659,III,"Yet through measured grave accord,"
1660,III,Hears the heart of wildness beat
1661,III,Like a centaur’s hoof on sward.
1662,III,"Drink the sense the notes infuse,"
1663,III,You a larger self will find:
1664,III,Sweetest fellowship ensues
1665,III,With the creatures of your kind.
1666,III,"Ay, and Love, if Love it be"
1667,III,"Flaming over _I_ and _ME_,"
1668,III,Love meet they who do not shove
1669,III,Cravings in the van of Love.
1670,III,"Courtly dames are here to woo,"
1671,III,Knowing love if it be true.
1672,III,Reverence the blossom-shoot
1673,III,"Fervently, they are the fruit."
1674,III,"Mark them stepping, hear them talk,"
1675,III,"Goddess, is no myth inane,"
1676,III,You will say of those who walk
1677,III,In the woods of Westermain.
1678,III,Waters that from throat and thigh
1679,III,Dart the sun his arrows back;
1680,III,Leaves that on a woodland sigh
1681,III,Chat of secret things no lack;
1682,III,"Shadowy branch-leaves, waters clear,"
1683,III,Bare or veiled they move sincere;
1684,III,Not by slavish terrors tripped
1685,III,"Being anew in nature dipped,"
1686,III,"Growths of what they step on, these;"
1687,III,With the roots the grace of trees.
1688,III,"Casket-breasts they give, nor hide,"
1689,III,"For a tyrant’s flattered pride,"
1690,III,"Mind, which nourished not by light,"
1691,III,Lurks the shuffling trickster sprite:
1692,III,Whereof are strange tales to tell;
1693,III,"Some in blood writ, tombed in bell."
1694,III,"Here the ancient battle ends,"
1695,III,"Joining two astonished friends,"
1696,III,Who the kiss can give and take
1697,III,With more warmth than in that world
1698,III,"Where the tiger claws the snake,"
1699,III,"Snake her tiger clasps infurled,"
1700,III,And the issue of their fight
1701,III,People lands in snarling plight.
1702,III,Here her splendid beast she leads
1703,III,Silken-leashed and decked with weeds
1704,III,"Wild as he, but breathing faint"
1705,III,Sweetness of unfelt constraint.
1706,III,"Love, the great volcano, flings"
1707,III,Fires of lower Earth to sky;
1708,III,"Love, the sole permitted, sings"
1709,III,Sovereignly of _ME_ and _I_.
1710,III,"Bowers he has of sacred shade,"
1711,III,"Spaces of superb parade,"
1712,III,Voiceful . . . But bring you a note
1713,III,"Wrangling, howsoe’er remote,"
1714,III,Discords out of discord spin
1715,III,Round and round derisive din:
1716,III,Sudden will a pallor pant
1717,III,Chill at screeches miscreant;
1718,III,"Owls or spectres, thick they flee;"
1719,III,Nightmare upon horror broods;
1720,III,"Hooded laughter, monkish glee,"
1721,III,Gaps the vital air.
1722,III,Enter these enchanted woods
1723,III,You who dare.
1724,III,
1725,III,
1726,IV,IV
1727,IV,
1728,IV,
1729,IV,You must love the light so well
1730,IV,That no darkness will seem fell.
1731,IV,Love it so you could accost
1732,IV,Fellowly a livid ghost.
1733,IV,"Whish! the phantom wisps away,"
1734,IV,Owns him smoke to cocks of day.
1735,IV,In your breast the light must burn
1736,IV,"Fed of you, like corn in quern"
1737,IV,Ever plumping while the wheel
1738,IV,Speeds the mill and drains the meal.
1739,IV,"Light to light sees little strange,"
1740,IV,Only features heavenly new;
1741,IV,"Then you touch the nerve of Change,"
1742,IV,Then of Earth you have the clue;
1743,IV,Then her two-sexed meanings melt
1744,IV,"Through you, wed the thought and felt."
1745,IV,Sameness locks no scurfy pond
1746,IV,"Here for Custom, crazy-fond:"
1747,IV,Change is on the wing to bud
1748,IV,Rose in brain from rose in blood.
1749,IV,Wisdom throbbing shall you see
1750,IV,Central in complexity;
1751,IV,From her pasture ’mid the beasts
1752,IV,"Rise to her ethereal feasts,"
1753,IV,"Not, though lightnings track your wit"
1754,IV,"Starward, scorning them you quit:"
1755,IV,For be sure the bravest wing
1756,IV,"Preens it in our common spring,"
1757,IV,"Thence along the vault to soar,"
1758,IV,"You with others, gathering more,"
1759,IV,"Glad of more, till you reject"
1760,IV,"Your proud title of elect,"
1761,IV,Perilous even here while few
1762,IV,Roam the arched greenwood with you.
1763,IV,Heed that snare.
1764,IV,Muffled by his cavern-cowl
1765,IV,"Squats the scaly Dragon-fowl,"
1766,IV,"Who was lord ere light you drank,"
1767,IV,And lest blood of knightly rank
1768,IV,"Stream, let not your fair princess"
1769,IV,"Stray: he holds the leagues in stress,"
1770,IV,Watches keenly there.
1771,IV,Oft has he been riven; slain
1772,IV,Is no force in Westermain.
1773,IV,"Wait, and we shall forge him curbs,"
1774,IV,"Put his fangs to uses, tame,"
1775,IV,"Teach him, quick as cunning herbs,"
1776,IV,How to cure him sick and lame.
1777,IV,"Much restricted, much enringed,"
1778,IV,"Much he frets, the hooked and winged,"
1779,IV,Never known to spare.
1780,IV,’Tis enough: the name of Sage
1781,IV,"Hits no thing in nature, nought;"
1782,IV,"Man the least, save when grave Age"
1783,IV,From yon Dragon guards his thought.
1784,IV,Eye him when you hearken dumb
1785,IV,To what words from Wisdom come.
1786,IV,When she says how few are by
1787,IV,"Listening to her, eye his eye."
1788,IV,"Self, his name declare."
1789,IV,"Him shall Change, transforming late,"
1790,IV,Wonderously renovate.
1791,IV,Hug himself the creature may:
1792,IV,What he hugs is loathed decay.
1793,IV,"Crying, slip thy scales, and slough!"
1794,IV,Change will strip his armour off;
1795,IV,"Make of him who was all maw,"
1796,IV,"Inly only thrilling-shrewd,"
1797,IV,Such a servant as none saw
1798,IV,Through his days of dragonhood.
1799,IV,"Days when growling o’er his bone,"
1800,IV,Sharpened he for mine and thine;
1801,IV,Sensitive within alone;
1802,IV,Scaly as the bark of pine.
1803,IV,"Change, the strongest son of Life,"
1804,IV,Has the Spirit here to wife.
1805,IV,"Lo, their young of vivid breed,"
1806,IV,"Bear the lights that onward speed,"
1807,IV,"Threading thickets, mounting glades,"
1808,IV,"Up the verdurous colonnades,"
1809,IV,"Round the fluttered curves, and down,"
1810,IV,"Out of sight of Earth’s blue crown,"
1811,IV,"Whither, in her central space,"
1812,IV,Spouts the Fount and Lure o’ the chase.
1813,IV,"Fount unresting, Lure divine!"
1814,IV,There meet all: too late look most.
1815,IV,"Fire in water hued as wine,"
1816,IV,"Springs amid a shadowy host,"
1817,IV,"Circled: one close-headed mob,"
1818,IV,"Breathless, scanning divers heaps,"
1819,IV,"Where a Heart begins to throb,"
1820,IV,"Where it ceases, slow, with leaps."
1821,IV,"And ’tis very strange, ’tis said,"
1822,IV,How you spy in each of them
1823,IV,"Semblance of that Dragon red,"
1824,IV,As the oak in bracken-stem.
1825,IV,"And, ’tis said, how each and each:"
1826,IV,"Which commences, which subsides:"
1827,IV,First my Dragon! doth beseech
1828,IV,Her who food for all provides.
1829,IV,And she answers with no sign;
1830,IV,Utters neither yea nor nay;
1831,IV,Fires the water hued as wine;
1832,IV,Kneads another spark in clay.
1833,IV,Terror is about her hid;
1834,IV,Silence of the thunders locked;
1835,IV,Lightnings lining the shut lid;
1836,IV,Fixity on quaking rocked.
1837,IV,"Lo, you look at Flow and Drought"
1838,IV,Interflashed and interwrought:
1839,IV,"Ended is begun, begun"
1840,IV,"Ended, quick as torrents run."
1841,IV,Young Impulsion spouts to sink;
1842,IV,Luridness and lustre link;
1843,IV,’Tis your come and go of breath;
1844,IV,"Mirrored pants the Life, the Death;"
1845,IV,Each of either reaped and sown:
1846,IV,Rosiest rosy wanes to crone.
1847,IV,See you so? your senses drift;
1848,IV,’Tis a shuttle weaving swift.
1849,IV,"Look with spirit past the sense,"
1850,IV,Spirit shines in permanence.
1851,IV,"That is She, the view of whom"
1852,IV,"Is the dust within the tomb,"
1853,IV,"Is the inner blush above,"
1854,IV,"Look to loathe, or look to love;"
1855,IV,"Think her Lump, or know her Flame;"
1856,IV,"Dread her scourge, or read her aim;"
1857,IV,Shoot your hungers from their nerve;
1858,IV,"Or, in her example, serve."
1859,IV,Some have found her sitting grave;
1860,IV,"Laughing, some; or, browed with sweat,"
1861,IV,Hurling dust of fool and knave
1862,IV,In a hissing smithy’s jet.
1863,IV,More it were not well to speak;
1864,IV,"Burn to see, you need but seek."
1865,IV,Once beheld she gives the key
1866,IV,"Airing every doorway, she."
1867,IV,Little can you stop or steer
1868,IV,Ere of her you are the seër.
1869,IV,"On the surface she will witch,"
1870,IV,"Rendering Beauty yours, but gaze"
1871,IV,"Under, and the soul is rich"
1872,IV,"Past computing, past amaze."
1873,IV,Then is courage that endures
1874,IV,Even her awful tremble yours.
1875,IV,"Then, the reflex of that Fount"
1876,IV,"Spied below, will Reason mount"
1877,IV,"Lordly and a quenchless force,"
1878,IV,"Lighting Pain to its mad source,"
1879,IV,"Scaring Fear till Fear escapes,"
1880,IV,Shot through all its phantom shapes.
1881,IV,Then your spirit will perceive
1882,IV,Fleshly seed of fleshly sins;
1883,IV,"Where the passions interweave,"
1884,IV,How the serpent tangle spins
1885,IV,"Of the sense of Earth misprised,"
1886,IV,Brainlessly unrecognized;
1887,IV,"She being Spirit in her clods,"
1888,IV,Footway to the God of Gods.
1889,IV,"Then for you are pleasures pure,"
1890,IV,Sureties as the stars are sure:
1891,IV,Not the wanton beckoning flags
1892,IV,"Which, of flattery and delight,"
1893,IV,Wax to the grim Habit-Hags
1894,IV,Riding souls of men to night:
1895,IV,"Pleasures that through blood run sane,"
1896,IV,Quickening spirit from the brain.
1897,IV,"Each of each in sequent birth,"
1898,IV,"Blood and brain and spirit, three,"
1899,IV,"(Say the deepest gnomes of Earth),"
1900,IV,Join for true felicity.
1901,IV,"Are they parted, then expect"
1902,IV,Some one sailing will be wrecked:
1903,IV,"Separate hunting are they sped,"
1904,IV,Scan the morsel coveted.
1905,IV,Earth that Triad is: she hides
1906,IV,Joy from him who that divides;
1907,IV,Showers it when the three are one
1908,IV,Glassing her in union.
1909,IV,"Earth your haven, Earth your helm,"
1910,IV,You command a double realm;
1911,IV,"Labouring here to pay your debt,"
1912,IV,Till your little sun shall set;
1913,IV,Leaving her the future task:
1914,IV,Loving her too well to ask.
1915,IV,"Eglantine that climbs the yew,"
1916,IV,She her darkest wreathes for those
1917,IV,"Knowing her the Ever-new,"
1918,IV,And themselves the kin o’ the rose.
1919,IV,"Life, the chisel, axe and sword,"
1920,IV,Wield who have her depths explored:
1921,IV,"Life, the dream, shall be their robe"
1922,IV,Large as air about the globe;
1923,IV,"Life, the question, hear its cry"
1924,IV,Echoed with concordant Why;
1925,IV,"Life, the small self-dragon ramped,"
1926,IV,Thrill for service to be stamped.
1927,IV,"Ay, and over every height"
1928,IV,Life for them shall wave a wand:
1929,IV,"That, the last, where sits affright,"
1930,IV,Homely shows the stream beyond.
1931,IV,"Love the light and be its lynx,"
1932,IV,You will track her and attain;
1933,IV,Read her as no cruel Sphinx
1934,IV,"In the woods of Westermain,"
1935,IV,Daily fresh the woods are ranged;
1936,IV,"Glooms which otherwhere appal,"
1937,IV,"Sounded: here, their worths exchanged"
1938,IV,Urban joins with pastoral:
1939,IV,"Little lost, save what may drop"
1940,IV,"Husk-like, and the mind preserves."
1941,IV,"Natural overgrowths they lop,"
1942,IV,"Yet from nature neither swerves,"
1943,IV,Trained or savage: for this cause:
1944,IV,"Of our Earth they ply the laws,"
1945,IV,"Have in Earth their feeding root,"
1946,IV,Mind of man and bent of brute.
1947,IV,Hear that song; both wild and ruled.
1948,IV,Hear it: is it wail or mirth?
1949,IV,"Ordered, bubbled, quite unschooled?"
1950,IV,"None, and all: it springs of Earth."
1951,IV,O but hear it! ’tis the mind;
1952,IV,"Mind that with deep Earth unites,"
1953,IV,Round the solid trunk to wind
1954,IV,Rings of clasping parasites.
1955,IV,Music have you there to feed
1956,IV,Simplest and most soaring need.
1957,IV,"Free to wind, and in desire"
1958,IV,"Winding, they to her attached"
1959,IV,"Feel the trunk a spring of fire,"
1960,IV,"And ascend to heights unmatched,"
1961,IV,Whence the tidal world is viewed
1962,IV,"As a sea of windy wheat,"
1963,IV,"Momently black, barren, rude;"
1964,IV,"Golden-brown, for harvest meet,"
1965,IV,Dragon-reaped from folly-sown;
1966,IV,Bride-like to the sickle-blade:
1967,IV,"Quick it varies, while the moan,"
1968,IV,"Moan of a sad creature strayed,"
1969,IV,Chiefly is its voice.  So flesh
1970,IV,Conjures tempest-flails to thresh
1971,IV,Good from worthless.  Some clear lamps
1972,IV,Light it; more of dead marsh-damps.
1973,IV,"Monster is it still, and blind,"
1974,IV,Fit but to be led by Pain.
1975,IV,"Glance we at the paths behind,"
1976,IV,Fruitful sight has Westermain.
1977,IV,"There we laboured, and in turn"
1978,IV,"Forward our blown lamps discern,"
1979,IV,As you see on the dark deep
1980,IV,"Far the loftier billows leap,"
1981,IV,Foam for beacon bear.
1982,IV,"Hither, hither, if you will,"
1983,IV,"Drink instruction, or instil,"
1984,IV,"Run the woods like vernal sap,"
1985,IV,"Crying, hail to luminousness!"
1986,IV,But have care.
1987,IV,In yourself may lurk the trap:
1988,IV,On conditions they caress.
1989,IV,Here you meet the light invoked
1990,IV,Here is never secret cloaked.
1991,IV,Doubt you with the monster’s fry
1992,IV,All his orbit may exclude;
1993,IV,"Are you of the stiff, the dry,"
1994,IV,Cursing the not understood;
1995,IV,Grasp you with the monster’s claws;
1996,IV,Govern with his truncheon-saws;
1997,IV,"Hate, the shadow of a grain;"
1998,IV,You are lost in Westermain:
1999,IV,"Earthward swoops a vulture sun,"
2000,IV,Nighted upon carrion:
2001,IV,Straightway venom wine-cups shout
2002,IV,Toasts to One whose eyes are out:
2003,IV,Flowers along the reeling floor
2004,IV,Drip henbane and hellebore:
2005,IV,"Beauty, of her tresses shorn,"
2006,IV,Shrieks as nature’s maniac:
2007,IV,Hideousness on hoof and horn
2008,IV,"Tumbles, yapping in her track:"
2009,IV,"Haggard Wisdom, stately once,"
2010,IV,Leers fantastical and trips:
2011,IV,"Allegory drums the sconce,"
2012,IV,Impiousness nibblenips.
2013,IV,"Imp that dances, imp that flits,"
2014,IV,"Imp o’ the demon-growing girl,"
2015,IV,Maddest! whirl with imp o’ the pits
2016,IV,"Round you, and with them you whirl"
2017,IV,Fast where pours the fountain-rout
2018,IV,Out of Him whose eyes are out:
2019,IV,"Multitudes on multitudes,"
2020,IV,Drenched in wallowing devilry:
2021,IV,"And you ask where you may be,"
2022,IV,In what reek of a lair
2023,IV,Given to bones and ogre-broods:
2024,IV,And they yell you Where.
2025,IV,"Enter these enchanted woods,"
2026,IV,You who dare.

2037,I,"I met the grey mist Death, whose eyeless brow"
2038,I,"Was bent on me, and from his hand of chalk"
2039,I,He reached me flowers as from a withered bough:

2059,III,Joined notes of Death and Life till night’s decline

2071,I,"Deeper than flower and fruit,"
2072,I,"Losing some hue of his mirth,"
2073,I,"As the tree striking rock at the root,"
2074,I,Unto him shall the marvellous tale
2075,I,Of Callistes more humanly come
2076,I,With the touch on his breast than a hail
2077,I,From the markets that hum.
2078,I,
2079,I,
2080,II,II
2081,II,
2082,II,
2083,II,Now the youth footed swift to the dawn.
2084,II,"’Twas the season when wintertide,"
2085,II,"In the higher rock-hollows updrawn,"
2086,II,"Leaves meadows to bud, and he spied,"
2087,II,"By light throwing shallow shade,"
2088,II,"Between the beam and the gloom,"
2089,II,"Sicilian Enna, whose Maid"
2090,II,Such aspect wears in her bloom
2091,II,Underneath since the Charioteer
2092,II,"Of Darkness whirled her away,"
2093,II,"On a reaped afternoon of the year,"
2094,II,Nigh the poppy-droop of Day.
2095,II,"O and naked of her, all dust,"
2096,II,"The majestic Mother and Nurse,"
2097,II,"Ringing cries to the God, the Just,"
2098,II,Curled the land with the blight of her curse:
2099,II,Recollected of this glad isle
2100,II,"Still quaking.  But now more fair,"
2101,II,And momently fraying the while
2102,II,"The veil of the shadows there,"
2103,II,Soft Enna that prostrate grief
2104,II,"Sang through, and revealed round the vines,"
2105,II,"Bronze-orange, the crisp young leaf,"
2106,II,"The wheat-blades tripping in lines,"
2107,II,A hue unillumined by sun
2108,II,Of the flowers flooding grass as from founts:
2109,II,All the penetrable dun
2110,II,Of the morn ere she mounts.
2111,II,
2112,II,
2113,III,III
2114,III,
2115,III,
2116,III,Nor had saffron and sapphire and red
2117,III,"Waved aloft to their sisters below,"
2118,III,When gaped by the rock-channel head
2119,III,"Of the lake, black, a cave at one blow,"
2120,III,Reverberant over the plain:
2121,III,A sound oft fearfully swung
2122,III,For the coming of wrathful rain:
2123,III,"And forth, like the dragon-tongue"
2124,III,"Of a fire beaten flat by the gale,"
2125,III,"But more as the smoke to behold,"
2126,III,A chariot burst.  Then a wail
2127,III,Quivered high of the love that would fold
2128,III,"Bliss immeasurable, bigger than heart,"
2129,III,"Though a God’s: and the wheels were stayed,"
2130,III,And the team of the chariot swart
2131,III,"Reared in marble, the six, dismayed,"
2132,III,Like hoofs that by night plashing sea
2133,III,Curve and ramp from the vast swan-wave:
2134,III,"For, lo, the Great Mother, She!"
2135,III,"And Callistes gazed, he gave"
2136,III,His eyeballs up to the sight:
2137,III,"The embrace of the Twain, of whom"
2138,III,"To men are their day, their night,"
2139,III,Mellow fruits and the shearing tomb:
2140,III,Our Lady of the Sheaves
2141,III,"And the Lily of Hades, the Sweet"
2142,III,Of Enna: he saw through leaves
2143,III,The Mother and Daughter meet.
2144,III,"They stood by the chariot-wheel,"
2145,III,"Embraced, very tall, most like"
2146,III,"Fellow poplars, wind-taken, that reel"
2147,III,Down their shivering columns and strike
2148,III,"Head to head, crossing throats: and apart,"
2149,III,"For the feast of the look, they drew,"
2150,III,Which Darkness no longer could thwart;
2151,III,"And they broke together anew,"
2152,III,"Exulting to tears, flower and bud."
2153,III,But the mate of the Rayless was grave:
2154,III,"She smiled like Sleep on its flood,"
2155,III,That washes of all we crave:
2156,III,Like the trance of eyes awake
2157,III,"And the spirit enshrouded, she cast"
2158,III,The wan underworld on the lake.
2159,III,"They were so, and they passed."
2160,III,
2161,III,
2162,IV,IV
2163,IV,
2164,IV,
2165,IV,"He tells it, who knew the law"
2166,IV,Upon mortals: he stood alive
2167,IV,Declaring that this he saw:
2168,IV,"He could see, and survive."
2169,IV,
2170,IV,
2171,V,V
2172,V,
2173,V,
2174,V,Now the youth was not ware of the beams
2175,V,"With the grasses intertwined,"
2176,V,"For each thing seen, as in dreams,"
2177,V,"Came stepping to rear through his mind,"
2178,V,Till it struck his remembered prayer
2179,V,To be witness of this which had flown
2180,V,"Like a smoke melted thinner than air,"
2181,V,That the vacancy doth disown.
2182,V,"And viewing a maiden, he thought"
2183,V,"It might now be morn, and afar"
2184,V,Within him the memory wrought
2185,V,Of a something that slipped from the car
2186,V,"When those, the august, moved by:"
2187,V,"Perchance a scarf, and perchance"
2188,V,"This maiden.  She did not fly,"
2189,V,Nor started at his advance:
2190,V,"She looked, as when infinite thirst"
2191,V,"Pants pausing to bless the springs,"
2192,V,"Refreshed, unsated.  Then first"
2193,V,He trembled with awe of the things
2194,V,"He had seen; and he did transfer,"
2195,V,"Divining and doubting in turn,"
2196,V,His reverence unto her;
2197,V,Nor asked what he crouched to learn:
2198,V,"The whence of her, whither, and why"
2199,V,"Her presence there, and her name,"
2200,V,Her parentage: under which sky
2201,V,"Her birth, and how hither she came,"
2202,V,"So young, a virgin, alone,"
2203,V,"Unfriended, having no fear,"
2204,V,"As Oreads have; no moan,"
2205,V,Like the lost upon earth; no tear;
2206,V,"Not a sign of the torch in the blood,"
2207,V,Though her stature had reached the height
2208,V,When mantles a tender rud
2209,V,"In maids that of youths have sight,"
2210,V,If maids of our seed they be:
2211,V,For he said: A glad vision art thou!
2212,V,And she answered him: Thou to me!
2213,V,As men utter a vow.
2214,V,
2215,V,
2216,VI,VI
2217,VI,
2218,VI,
2219,VI,"Then said she, quick as the cries"
2220,VI,Of the rainy cranes: Light! light!
2221,VI,"And Helios rose in her eyes,"
2222,VI,"That were full as the dew-balls bright,"
2223,VI,Relucent to him as dews
2224,VI,"Unshaded.  Breathing, she sent"
2225,VI,"Her voice to the God of the Muse,"
2226,VI,"And along the vale it went,"
2227,VI,"Strange to hear: not thin, not shrill:"
2228,VI,"Sweet, but no young maid’s throat:"
2229,VI,The echo beyond the hill
2230,VI,Ran falling on half the note:
2231,VI,And under the shaken ground
2232,VI,Where the Hundred-headed groans
2233,VI,"By the roots of great Aetna bound,"
2234,VI,As of him were hollow tones
2235,VI,Of wondering roared: a tale
2236,VI,Repeated to sunless halls.
2237,VI,But now off the face of the vale
2238,VI,"Shadows fled in a breath, and the walls"
2239,VI,"Of the lake’s rock-head were gold,"
2240,VI,"And the breast of the lake, that swell"
2241,VI,Of the crestless long wave rolled
2242,VI,"To shore-bubble, pebble and shell."
2243,VI,A morning of radiant lids
2244,VI,O’er the dance of the earth opened wide:
2245,VI,"The bees chose their flowers, the snub kids"
2246,VI,"Upon hindlegs went sportive, or plied,"
2247,VI,"Nosing, hard at the dugs to be filled:"
2248,VI,"There was milk, honey, music to make:"
2249,VI,Up their branches the little birds billed:
2250,VI,"Chirrup, drone, bleat and buzz ringed the lake."
2251,VI,"O shining in sunlight, chief"
2252,VI,"After water and water’s caress,"
2253,VI,"Was the young bronze-orange leaf,"
2254,VI,"That clung to the tree as a tress,"
2255,VI,Shooting lucid tendrils to wed
2256,VI,"With the vine-hook tree or pole,"
2257,VI,Like Arachne launched out on her thread.
2258,VI,Then the maiden her dusky stole
2259,VI,"In the span of the black-starred zone,"
2260,VI,Gathered up for her footing fleet.
2261,VI,As one that had toil of her own
2262,VI,She followed the lines of wheat
2263,VI,"Tripping straight through the fields, green blades,"
2264,VI,"To the groves of olive grey,"
2265,VI,"Downy-grey, golden-tinged: and to glades"
2266,VI,Where the pear-blossom thickens the spray
2267,VI,"In a night, like the snow-packed storm:"
2268,VI,"Pear, apple, almond, plum:"
2269,VI,"Not wintry now: pushing, warm!"
2270,VI,"And she touched them with finger and thumb,"
2271,VI,"As the vine-hook closes: she smiled,"
2272,VI,"Recounting again and again,"
2273,VI,"Corn, wine, fruit, oil! like a child,"
2274,VI,With the meaning known to men.
2275,VI,For hours in the track of the plough
2276,VI,"And the pruning-knife she stepped,"
2277,VI,"And of how the seed works, and of how"
2278,VI,"Yields the soil, she seemed adept."
2279,VI,"Then she murmured that name of the dearth,"
2280,VI,"The Beneficent, Hers, who bade"
2281,VI,Our husbandmen sow for the birth
2282,VI,Of the grain making earth full glad.
2283,VI,She murmured that Other’s: the dirge
2284,VI,Of life-light: for whose dark lap
2285,VI,Our locks are clipped on the verge
2286,VI,Of the realm where runs no sap.
2287,VI,She said: We have looked on both!
2288,VI,And her eyes had a wavering beam
2289,VI,"Of various lights, like the froth"
2290,VI,Of the storm-swollen ravine stream
2291,VI,In flame of the bolt.  What links
2292,VI,Were these which had made him her friend?
2293,VI,"He eyed her, as one who drinks,"
2294,VI,And would drink to the end.
2295,VI,
2296,VI,
2297,VII,VII
2298,VII,
2299,VII,
2300,VII,"Now the meadows with crocus besprent,"
2301,VII,"And the asphodel woodsides she left,"
2302,VII,"And the lake-slopes, the ravishing scent"
2303,VII,"Of narcissus, dark-sweet, for the cleft"
2304,VII,"That tutors the torrent-brook,"
2305,VII,Delaying its forceful spleen
2306,VII,With many a wind and crook
2307,VII,Through rock to the broad ravine.
2308,VII,"By the hyacinth-bells in the brakes,"
2309,VII,"And the shade-loved white windflower, half hid,"
2310,VII,And the sun-loving lizards and snakes
2311,VII,"On the cleft’s barren ledges, that slid"
2312,VII,"Out of sight, smooth as waterdrops, all,"
2313,VII,At a snap of twig or bark
2314,VII,"In the track of the foreign foot-fall,"
2315,VII,"She climbed to the pineforest dark,"
2316,VII,Overbrowing an emerald chine
2317,VII,"Of the grass-billows.  Thence, as a wreath,"
2318,VII,"Running poplar and cypress to pine,"
2319,VII,"The lake-banks are seen, and beneath,"
2320,VII,"Vineyard, village, groves, rivers, towers, farms,"
2321,VII,"The citadel watching the bay,"
2322,VII,"The bay with the town in its arms,"
2323,VII,The town shining white as the spray
2324,VII,"Of the sapphire sea-wave on the rock,"
2325,VII,"Where the rock stars the girdle of sea,"
2326,VII,"White-ringed, as the midday flock,"
2327,VII,"Clipped by heat, rings the round of the tree."
2328,VII,That hour of the piercing shaft
2329,VII,"Transfixes bough-shadows, confused"
2330,VII,"In veins of fire, and she laughed,"
2331,VII,With her quiet mouth amused
2332,VII,"To see the whole flock, adroop,"
2333,VII,"Asleep, hug the tree-stem as one,"
2334,VII,Imperceptibly filling the loop
2335,VII,Of its shade at a slant of sun.
2336,VII,"The pipes under pent of the crag,"
2337,VII,"Where the goatherds in piping recline,"
2338,VII,"Have whimsical stops, burst and flag"
2339,VII,Uncorrected as outstretched swine:
2340,VII,"For the fingers are slack and unsure,"
2341,VII,And the wind issues querulous:—thorns
2342,VII,"And snakes!—but she listened demure,"
2343,VII,Comparing day’s music with morn’s.
2344,VII,Of the gentle spirit that slips
2345,VII,"From the bark of the tree she discoursed,"
2346,VII,"And of her of the wells, whose lips"
2347,VII,"Are coolness enchanting, rock-sourced."
2348,VII,"And much of the sacred loon,"
2349,VII,"The frolic, the Goatfoot God,"
2350,VII,For stories of indolent noon
2351,VII,"In the pineforest’s odorous nod,"
2352,VII,"She questioned, not knowing: he can"
2353,VII,"Be waspish, irascible, rude,"
2354,VII,"He is oftener friendly to man,"
2355,VII,And ever to beasts and their brood.
2356,VII,"For the which did she love him well,"
2357,VII,"She said, and his pipes of the reed,"
2358,VII,His twitched lips puffing to tell
2359,VII,"In music his tears and his need,"
2360,VII,Against the sharp catch of his hurt.
2361,VII,"Not as shepherds of Pan did she speak,"
2362,VII,"Nor spake as the schools, to divert,"
2363,VII,"But fondly, perceiving him weak"
2364,VII,"Before Gods, and to shepherds a fear,"
2365,VII,"A holiness, horn and heel."
2366,VII,All this she had learnt in her ear
2367,VII,"From Callistes, and taught him to feel."
2368,VII,"Yea, the solemn divinity flushed"
2369,VII,"Through the shaggy brown skin of the beast,"
2370,VII,"And the steeps where the cataract rushed,"
2371,VII,"And the wilds where the forest is priest,"
2372,VII,"Were his temple to clothe him in awe,"
2373,VII,While she spake: ’twas a wonder: she read
2374,VII,The haunts of the beak and the claw
2375,VII,"As plain as the land of bread,"
2376,VII,"But Cities and martial States,"
2377,VII,"Whither soon the youth veered his theme,"
2378,VII,Were impervious barrier-gates
2379,VII,"To her: and that ship, a trireme,"
2380,VII,"Nearing harbour, scarce wakened her glance,"
2381,VII,Though he dwelt on the message it bore
2382,VII,Of sceptre and sword and lance
2383,VII,"To the bee-swarms black on the shore,"
2384,VII,"Which were audible almost,"
2385,VII,So black they were.  It befel
2386,VII,That he called up the warrior host
2387,VII,Of the Song pouring hydromel
2388,VII,"In thunder, the wide-winged Song."
2389,VII,And he named with his boyish pride
2390,VII,"The heroes, the noble throng"
2391,VII,"Past Acheron now, foul tide!"
2392,VII,With his joy of the godlike band
2393,VII,"And the verse divine, he named"
2394,VII,"The chiefs pressing hot on the strand,"
2395,VII,"Seen of Gods, of Gods aided, and maimed."
2396,VII,The fleetfoot and ireful; the King;
2397,VII,"Him, the prompter in stratagem,"
2398,VII,"Many-shifted and masterful: Sing,"
2399,VII,O Muse!  But she cried: Not of them
2400,VII,"She breathed as if breath had failed,"
2401,VII,"And her eyes, while she bade him desist,"
2402,VII,"Held the lost-to-light ghosts grey-mailed,"
2403,VII,As you see the grey river-mist
2404,VII,Hold shapes on the yonder bank.
2405,VII,"A moment her body waned,"
2406,VII,The light of her sprang and sank:
2407,VII,"Then she looked at the sun, she regained"
2408,VII,"Clear feature, and she breathed deep."
2409,VII,"She wore the wan smile he had seen,"
2410,VII,"As the flow of the river of Sleep,"
2411,VII,On the mouth of the Shadow-Queen.
2412,VII,"In sunlight she craved to bask,"
2413,VII,Saying: Life!  And who was she? who?
2414,VII,"Of what issue?  He dared not ask,"
2415,VII,For that partly he knew.
2416,VII,
2417,VII,
2418,VIII,VIII
2419,VIII,
2420,VIII,
2421,VIII,A noise of the hollow ground
2422,VIII,Turned the eye to the ear in debate:
2423,VIII,Not the soft overflowing of sound
2424,VIII,"Of the pines, ranked, lofty, straight,"
2425,VIII,"Barely swayed to some whispers remote,"
2426,VIII,Some swarming whispers above:
2427,VIII,"Not the pines with the faint airs afloat,"
2428,VIII,Hush-hushing the nested dove:
2429,VIII,"It was not the pines, or the rout"
2430,VIII,"Oft heard from mid-forest in chase,"
2431,VIII,But the long muffled roar of a shout
2432,VIII,Subterranean.  Sharp grew her face.
2433,VIII,"She rose, yet not moved by affright;"
2434,VIII,’Twas rather good haste to use
2435,VIII,Her holiday of delight
2436,VIII,In the beams of the God of the Muse.
2437,VIII,"And the steeps of the forest she crossed,"
2438,VIII,On its dry red sheddings and cones
2439,VIII,"Up the paths by roots green-mossed,"
2440,VIII,"Spotted amber, and old mossed stones."
2441,VIII,Then out where the brook-torrent starts
2442,VIII,"To her leap, and from bend to curve"
2443,VIII,A hurrying elbow darts
2444,VIII,"For the instant-glancing swerve,"
2445,VIII,"Decisive, with violent will"
2446,VIII,"In the action formed, like hers,"
2447,VIII,"The maiden’s, ascending; and still"
2448,VIII,"Ascending, the bud of the furze,"
2449,VIII,"The broom, and all blue-berried shoots"
2450,VIII,"Of stubborn and prickly kind,"
2451,VIII,"The juniper flat on its roots,"
2452,VIII,"The dwarf rhododaphne, behind"
2453,VIII,"She left, and the mountain sheep"
2454,VIII,"Far behind, goat, herbage and flower."
2455,VIII,"The island was hers, and the deep,"
2456,VIII,"All heaven, a golden hour."
2457,VIII,"Then with wonderful voice, that rang"
2458,VIII,"Through air as the swan’s nigh death,"
2459,VIII,"Of the glory of Light she sang,"
2460,VIII,She sang of the rapture of Breath.
2461,VIII,"Nor ever, says he who heard,"
2462,VIII,"Heard Earth in her boundaries broad,"
2463,VIII,From bosom of singer or bird
2464,VIII,A sweetness thus rich of the God
2465,VIII,Whose harmonies always are sane.
2466,VIII,"She sang of furrow and seed,"
2467,VIII,"The burial, birth of the grain,"
2468,VIII,"The growth, and the showers that feed,"
2469,VIII,And the green blades waxing mature
2470,VIII,For the husbandman’s armful brown.
2471,VIII,"O, the song in its burden ran pure,"
2472,VIII,And burden to song was a crown.
2473,VIII,"Callistes, a singer, skilled"
2474,VIII,"In the gift he could measure and praise,"
2475,VIII,"By a rival’s art was thrilled,"
2476,VIII,"Though she sang but a Song of Days,"
2477,VIII,Where the husbandman’s toil and strife
2478,VIII,Little varies to strife and toil:
2479,VIII,"But the milky kernel of life,"
2480,VIII,"With her numbered: corn, wine, fruit, oil"
2481,VIII,The song did give him to eat:
2482,VIII,"Gave the first rapt vision of Good,"
2483,VIII,And the fresh young sense of Sweet
2484,VIII,"The grace of the battle for food,"
2485,VIII,With the issue Earth cannot refuse
2486,VIII,When men to their labour are sworn.
2487,VIII,’Twas a song of the God of the Muse
2488,VIII,To the forehead of Morn.

2491,IX,IX
2492,IX,
2493,IX,
2494,IX,"Him loved she.  Lo, now was he veiled:"
2495,IX,Over sea stood a swelled cloud-rack:
2496,IX,"The fishing-boat heavenward sailed,"
2497,IX,"Bent abeam, with a whitened track,"
2498,IX,"Surprised, fast hauling the net,"
2499,IX,"As it flew: sea dashed, earth shook."
2500,IX,She said: Is it night?  O not yet!
2501,IX,With a travail of thoughts in her look.
2502,IX,The mountain heaved up to its peak:
2503,IX,Sea darkened: earth gathered her fowl;
2504,IX,Of bird or of branch rose the shriek.
2505,IX,Night? but never so fell a scowl
2506,IX,"Wore night, nor the sky since then"
2507,IX,"When ocean ran swallowing shore,"
2508,IX,And the Gods looked down for men.
2509,IX,Broke tempest with that stern roar
2510,IX,"Never yet, save when black on the whirl"
2511,IX,Rode wrath of a sovereign Power.
2512,IX,"Then the youth and the shuddering girl,"
2513,IX,"Dim as shades in the angry shower,"
2514,IX,Joined hands and descended a maze
2515,IX,Of the paths that were racing alive
2516,IX,"Round boulder and bush, cleaving ways,"
2517,IX,"Incessant, with sound of a hive."
2518,IX,The height was a fountain-urn
2519,IX,"Pouring streams, and the whole solid height"
2520,IX,"Leaped, chasing at every turn"
2521,IX,The pair in one spirit of flight
2522,IX,"To the folding pineforest.  Yet here,"
2523,IX,"Like the pause to things hunted, in doubt,"
2524,IX,The stillness bred spectral fear
2525,IX,"Of the awfulness ranging without,"
2526,IX,"And imminent.  Downward they fled,"
2527,IX,"From under the haunted roof,"
2528,IX,To the valley aquake with the tread
2529,IX,"Of an iron-resounding hoof,"
2530,IX,As of legions of thunderful horse
2531,IX,Broken loose and in line tramping hard.
2532,IX,For the rage of a hungry force
2533,IX,Roamed blind of its mark over sward:
2534,IX,They saw it rush dense in the cloak
2535,IX,Of its travelling swathe of steam;
2536,IX,All the vale through a thin thread-smoke
2537,IX,Was thrown back to distance extreme:
2538,IX,"And dull the full breast of it blinked,"
2539,IX,"Like a buckler of steel breathed o’er,"
2540,IX,"Diminished, in strangeness distinct,"
2541,IX,"Glowing cold, unearthly, hoar:"
2542,IX,"An Enna of fields beyond sun,"
2543,IX,"Out of light, in a lurid web;"
2544,IX,And the traversing fury spun
2545,IX,Up and down with a wave’s flow and ebb;
2546,IX,"As the wave breaks to grasp and to spurn,"
2547,IX,"Retire, and in ravenous greed,"
2548,IX,"Inveterate, swell its return."
2549,IX,"Up and down, as if wringing from speed"
2550,IX,"Sights that made the unsighted appear,"
2551,IX,"Delude and dissolve, on it scoured."
2552,IX,"Lo, a sea upon land held career"
2553,IX,Through the plain of the vale half-devoured.
2554,IX,Callistes of home and escape
2555,IX,"Muttered swiftly, unwitting of speech."
2556,IX,"She gazed at the Void of shape,"
2557,IX,"She put her white hand to his reach,"
2558,IX,Saying: Now have we looked on the Three.
2559,IX,"And divided from day, from night,"
2560,IX,"From air that is breath, stood she,"
2561,IX,"Like the vale, out of light."
2562,IX,
2563,IX,
2564,X,X
2565,X,
2566,X,
2567,X,Then again in disorderly words
2568,X,"He muttered of home, and was mute,"
2569,X,With the heart of the cowering birds
2570,X,Ere they burst off the fowler’s foot.
2571,X,He gave her some redness that streamed
2572,X,Through her limbs in a flitting glow.
2573,X,"The sigh of our life she seemed,"
2574,X,The bliss of it clothing in woe.
2575,X,Frailer than flower when the round
2576,X,Of the sickle encircles it: strong
2577,X,"To tell of the things profound,"
2578,X,"Our inmost uttering song,"
2579,X,Unspoken.  So stood she awhile
2580,X,"In the gloom of the terror afield,"
2581,X,And the silence about her smile
2582,X,Said more than of tongue is revealed.
2583,X,I have breathed: I have gazed: I have been:
2584,X,It said: and not joylessly shone
2585,X,The remembrance of light through the screen
2586,X,Of a face that seemed shadow and stone.
2587,X,"She led the youth trembling, appalled,"
2588,X,To the lake-banks he saw sink and rise
2589,X,"Like a panic-struck breast.  Then she called,"
2590,X,And the hurricane blackness had eyes.
2591,X,It launched like the Thunderer’s bolt.
2592,X,"Pale she drooped, and the youth by her side"
2593,X,Would have clasped her and dared a revolt
2594,X,Sacrilegious as ever defied
2595,X,"High Olympus, but vainly for strength"
2596,X,His compassionate heart shook a frame
2597,X,Stricken rigid to ice all its length.
2598,X,On amain the black traveller came.
2599,X,"Lo, a chariot, cleaving the storm,"
2600,X,"Clove the fountaining lake with a plough,"
2601,X,And the lord of the steeds was in form
2602,X,"He, the God of implacable brow,"
2603,X,Darkness: he: he in person: he raged
2604,X,Through the wave like a boar of the wilds
2605,X,"From the hunters and hounds disengaged,"
2606,X,And a name shouted hoarsely: his child’s.
2607,X,Horror melted in anguish to hear.
2608,X,"Lo, the wave hissed apart for the path"
2609,X,"Of the terrible Charioteer,"
2610,X,"With the foam and torn features of wrath,"
2611,X,Hurled aloft on each arm in a sheet;
2612,X,"And the steeds clove it, rushing at land"
2613,X,Like the teeth of the famished at meat.
2614,X,Then he swept out his hand.
2615,X,
2616,X,
2617,XI,XI
2618,XI,
2619,XI,
2620,XI,"This, no more, doth Callistes recall:"
2621,XI,"He saw, ere he dropped in swoon,"
2622,XI,"On the maiden the chariot fall,"
2623,XI,As a thundercloud swings on the moon.
2624,XI,"Forth, free of the deluge, one cry"
2625,XI,From the vanishing gallop rose clear:
2626,XI,And: Skiágeneia! the sky
2627,XI,Rang; Skiágeneia! the sphere.
2628,XI,"And she left him therewith, to rejoice,"
2629,XI,"Repine, yearn, and know not his aim,"
2630,XI,"The life of their day in her voice,"
2631,XI,Left her life in her name.
2632,XI,
2633,XI,
2634,XII,XII
2635,XII,
2636,XII,
2637,XII,Now the valley in ruin of fields
2638,XII,"And fair meadowland, showing at eve"
2639,XII,Like the spear-pitted warrior’s shields
2640,XII,"After battle, bade men believe"
2641,XII,That no other than wrathfullest God
2642,XII,"Had been loose on her beautiful breast,"
2643,XII,"Where the flowery grass was clod,"
2644,XII,Wheat and vine as a trailing nest.
2645,XII,"The valley, discreet in grief,"
2646,XII,"Disclosed but the open truth,"
2647,XII,And Enna had hope of the sheaf:
2648,XII,There was none for the desolate youth
2649,XII,Devoted to mourn and to crave.
2650,XII,Of the secret he had divined
2651,XII,Of his friend of a day would he rave:
2652,XII,How for light of our earth she pined:
2653,XII,"For the olive, the vine and the wheat,"
2654,XII,Burning through with inherited fire:
2655,XII,"And when Mother went Mother to meet,"
2656,XII,She was prompted by simple desire
2657,XII,In the day-destined car to have place
2658,XII,"At the skirts of the Goddess, unseen,"
2659,XII,And be drawn to the dear earth’s face.
2660,XII,She was fire for the blue and the green
2661,XII,"Of our earth, dark fire; athirst"
2662,XII,"As a seed of her bosom for dawn,"
2663,XII,White air that had robed and nursed
2664,XII,Her mother.  Now was she gone
2665,XII,"With the Silent, the God without tear,"
2666,XII,Like a bud peeping out of its sheath
2667,XII,To be sundered and stamped with the sere.
2668,XII,"And Callistes to her beneath,"
2669,XII,"As she to our beams, extinct,"
2670,XII,Strained arms: he was shade of her shade.
2671,XII,In division so were they linked.
2672,XII,But the song which had betrayed
2673,XII,Her flight to the cavernous ear
2674,XII,For its own keenly wakeful: that song
2675,XII,"Of the sowing and reaping, and cheer"
2676,XII,Of the husbandman’s heart made strong
2677,XII,Through droughts and deluging rains
2678,XII,With his faith in the Great Mother’s love:
2679,XII,"O the joy of the breath she sustains,"
2680,XII,"And the lyre of the light above,"
2681,XII,"And the first rapt vision of Good,"
2682,XII,And the fresh young sense of Sweet:
2683,XII,That song the youth ever pursued
2684,XII,In the track of her footing fleet.
2685,XII,For men to be profited much
2686,XII,By her day upon earth did he sing:
2687,XII,"Of her voice, and her steps, and her touch"
2688,XII,"On the blossoms of tender Spring,"
2689,XII,Immortal: and how in her soul
2690,XII,"She is with them, and tearless abides,"
2691,XII,Folding grain of a love for one goal
2692,XII,"In patience, past flowing of tides."
2693,XII,"And if unto him she was tears,"
2694,XII,He wept not: he wasted within:
2695,XII,"Seeming sane in the song, to his peers,"
2696,XII,Only crazed where the cravings begin.
2697,XII,Our Lady of Gifts prized he less
2698,XII,Than her issue in darkness: the dim
2699,XII,Lost Skiágencia’s caress
2700,XII,Of our earth made it richest for him.
2701,XII,"And for that was a curse on him raised,"
2702,XII,"And he withered rathe, dry to his prime,"
2703,XII,Though the bounteous Giver be praised
2704,XII,Through the island with rites of old time
2705,XII,"Exceedingly fervent, and reaped"
2706,XII,"Veneration for teachings devout,"
2707,XII,Pious hymns when the corn-sheaves are heaped
2708,XII,"And the wine-presses ruddily spout,"
2709,XII,And the olive and apple are juice
2710,XII,At a touch light as hers lost below.
2711,XII,Whatsoever to men is of use
2712,XII,"Sprang his worship of them who bestow,"
2713,XII,In a measure of songs unexcelled:
2714,XII,But that soul loving earth and the sun
2715,XII,From her home of the shadows he held
2716,XII,For his beacon where beam there is none:
2717,XII,"And to join her, or have her brought back,"
2718,XII,"In his frenzy the singer would call,"
2719,XII,"Till he followed where never was track,"
2720,XII,On the path trod of all.

2771,THE LARK ASCENDING,Such wooing as the ear receives
2772,THE LARK ASCENDING,From zephyr caught in choric leaves
2773,THE LARK ASCENDING,Of aspens when their chattering net
2774,THE LARK ASCENDING,Is flushed to white with shivers wet;
2775,THE LARK ASCENDING,And such the water-spirit’s chime
2776,THE LARK ASCENDING,"On mountain heights in morning’s prime,"
2777,THE LARK ASCENDING,"Too freshly sweet to seem excess,"
2778,THE LARK ASCENDING,Too animate to need a stress;

2799,THE LARK ASCENDING,"The meadows green, the fallows brown,"
2800,THE LARK ASCENDING,The dreams of labour in the town;
2801,THE LARK ASCENDING,"He sings the sap, the quickened veins;"

2822,THE LARK ASCENDING,So pure that it salutes the suns
2823,THE LARK ASCENDING,"The voice of one for millions,"

3564,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,I CHANCED upon an early walk to spy
3565,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,A troop of children through an orchard gate:
3566,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,"The boughs hung low, the grass was high;"
3567,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,They had but to lift hands or wait
3568,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,For fruits to fill them; fruits were all their sky.
3569,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,
3570,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,"They shouted, running on from tree to tree,"
3571,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,"And played the game the wind plays, on and round."
3572,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,’Twas visible invisible glee
3573,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,Pursuing; and a fountain’s sound
3574,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,"Of laughter spouted, pattering fresh on me."

3576,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,"I could have watched them till the daylight fled,"

3579,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,The rest to comfort her straightway
3580,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,Seized on a branch and thumped down apples red.
3581,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,
3582,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,"The tiny creature flashing through green grass,"
3583,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,And laughing with her feet and eyes among
3584,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,"Fresh apples, while a little lass"
3585,THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATH,Over as o’er breeze-ripples hung:

6094,VI,No priest was hired for the play this night:

6096,VI,At sniff of the tainted wind; he gazed
6097,VI,"Where cresset-lamps in a door were raised,"

6553,VII,"Whence in waves her hair outrolled,"
6554,VII,’Twixt her brows the women saw
6555,VII,Shadows of a vulture’s claw
6556,VII,Gript in flight: strange knots that sped
6557,VII,Closing and dissolving aye:
6558,VII,Such as wicked dreams betray
6559,VII,When pale dawn creeps o’er the bed.
6560,VII,They might show the common pang
6561,VII,"Known to virgins, in whom dread"
6562,VII,Hunts their bliss like famished hounds;
6563,VII,While the chiefs with roaring rounds
6564,VII,"Tossed her to her lord, and sang"
6565,VII,"Praise of him whose hand was large,"
6566,VII,"Cheers for beauty brought to yield,"
6567,VII,"Chirrups of the trot afield,"
6568,VII,Hurrahs of the battle-charge.
6569,VII,
6570,VII,
6571,VIII,VIII
6572,VIII,
6573,VIII,
6574,VIII,Those rock-faces hung with weed
6575,VIII,"Reddened: their great days of speed,"
6576,VIII,"Slaughter, triumph, flood and flame,"
6577,VIII,"Like a jealous frenzy wrought,"
6578,VIII,"Scoffed at them and did them shame,"
6579,VIII,"Quaffing idle, conquering nought."
6580,VIII,O for the time when God decreed
6581,VIII,Earth the prey of Attila!
6582,VIII,"God called on thee in his wrath,"
6583,VIII,Trample it to mire!  ’Twas done.
6584,VIII,Swift as Danube clove our path
6585,VIII,Down from East to Western sun.
6586,VIII,"Huns! behold your pasture, gaze,"
6587,VIII,"Take, our king said: heel to flank"
6588,VIII,"(Whisper it, the war-horse neighs!)"
6589,VIII,"Forth we drove, and blood we drank"
6590,VIII,Fresh as dawn-dew: earth was ours:
6591,VIII,Men were flocks we lashed and spurned:
6592,VIII,"Fast as windy flame devours,"
6593,VIII,"Flame along the wind, we burned."
6594,VIII,"Arrow javelin, spear, and sword!"
6595,VIII,Here the snows and there the plains;
6596,VIII,On! our signal: onward poured
6597,VIII,"Torrents of the tightened reins,"
6598,VIII,Foaming over vine and corn
6599,VIII,Hot against the city-wall.
6600,VIII,"Whisper it, you sound a horn"
6601,VIII,To the grey beast in the stall!
6602,VIII,"Yea, he whinnies at a nod."
6603,VIII,O for sound of the trumpet-notes!
6604,VIII,"O for the time when thunder-shod,"
6605,VIII,"He that scarce can munch his oats,"
6606,VIII,"Hung on the peaks, brooded aloof,"
6607,VIII,"Champed the grain of the wrath of God,"
6608,VIII,"Pressed a cloud on the cowering roof,"
6609,VIII,Snorted out of the blackness fire!
6610,VIII,"Scarlet broke the sky, and down,"
6611,VIII,"Hammering West with print of his hoof,"
6612,VIII,He burst out of the bosom of ire
6613,VIII,"Sharp as eyelight under thy frown,"
6614,VIII,"Attila, my Attila!"
6615,VIII,
6616,VIII,
6617,IX,IX
6618,IX,
6619,IX,
6620,IX,Ravaged cities rolling smoke
6621,IX,"Thick on cornfields dry and black,"
6622,IX,"Wave his banners, bear his yoke."
6623,IX,"Track the lightning, and you track"
6624,IX,Attila.  They moan: ’tis he!
6625,IX,Bleed: ’tis he!  Beneath his foot
6626,IX,Leagues are deserts charred and mute;
6627,IX,"Where he passed, there passed a sea."
6628,IX,"Attila, my Attila!"
6629,IX,
6630,IX,
6631,X,X
6632,X,
6633,X,
6634,X,—Who breathed on the king cold breath?
6635,X,"Said a voice amid the host,"
6636,X,"He is Death that weds a ghost,"
6637,X,Else a ghost that weds with Death?
6638,X,Ildico’s chill little hand
6639,X,Shuddering he beheld: austere
6640,X,"Stared, as one who would command"
6641,X,Sight of what has filled his ear:
6642,X,"Plucked his thin beard, laughed disdain."
6643,X,"Feast, ye Huns!  His arm be raised,"
6644,X,"Like the warrior, battle-dazed,"
6645,X,Joining to the fight amain.
6646,X,Make the bed for Attila!
6647,X,
6648,X,
6649,XI,XI
6650,XI,
6651,XI,
6652,XI,Silent Ildico stood up.
6653,XI,"King and chief to pledge her well,"
6654,XI,"Shocked sword sword and cup on cup,"
6655,XI,Clamouring like a brazen bell.
6656,XI,Silent stepped the queenly slave.
6657,XI,"Fair, by heaven! she was to meet"
6658,XI,"On a midnight, near a grave,"
6659,XI,Flapping wide the winding-sheet.
6660,XI,
6661,XI,
6662,XII,XII
6663,XII,
6664,XII,
6665,XII,"Death and she walked through the crowd,"
6666,XII,Out beyond the flush of light.
6667,XII,Ceremonious women bowed
6668,XII,Following her: ’twas middle night.
6669,XII,Then the warriors each on each
6670,XII,"Spied, nor overloudly laughed;"
6671,XII,"Like the victims of the leech,"
6672,XII,Who have drunk of a strange draught.
6673,XII,
6674,XII,
6675,XIII,XIII
6676,XIII,
6677,XIII,
6678,XIII,Attila remained.  Even so
6679,XIII,"Frowned he when he struck the blow,"
6680,XIII,"Brained his horse, that stumbled twice,"
6681,XIII,"On a bloody day in Gaul,"
6682,XIII,"Bellowing, Perish omens!  All"
6683,XIII,"Marvelled at the sacrifice,"
6684,XIII,"But the battle, swinging dim,"
6685,XIII,Rang off that axe-blow for him.
6686,XIII,"Attila, my Attila!"
6687,XIII,
6688,XIII,
6689,XIV,XIV
6690,XIV,
6691,XIV,
6692,XIV,Brightening over Danube wheeled
6693,XIV,"Star by star; and she, most fair,"
6694,XIV,"Sweet as victory half-revealed,"
6695,XIV,Seized to make him glad and young;
6696,XIV,"She, O sweet as the dark sign"
6697,XIV,"Given him oft in battles gone,"
6698,XIV,"When the voice within said, Dare!"
6699,XIV,And the trumpet-notes were sprung
6700,XIV,Rapturous for the charge in line:
6701,XIV,She lay waiting: fair as dawn
6702,XIV,Wrapped in folds of night she lay;
6703,XIV,"Secret, lustrous; flaglike there,"
6704,XIV,"Waiting him to stream and ray,"
6705,XIV,"With one loosening blush outflung,"
6706,XIV,Colours of his hordes of horse
6707,XIV,Ranked for combat; still he hung
6708,XIV,"Like the fever dreading air,"
6709,XIV,Cursed of heat; and as a corse
6710,XIV,"Gathers vultures, in his brain"
6711,XIV,Images of her eyes and kiss
6712,XIV,Plucked at the limbs that could remain
6713,XIV,Loitering nigh the doors of bliss.
6714,XIV,Make the bed for Attila!
6715,XIV,
6716,XIV,
6717,XV,XV
6718,XV,
6719,XV,
6720,XV,"Passion on one hand, on one,"
6721,XV,Destiny led forth the Hun.
6722,XV,"Heard ye outcries of affright,"
6723,XV,"Voices that through many a fray,"
6724,XV,"In the press of flag and spear,"
6725,XV,Warned the king of peril near?
6726,XV,"Men were dumb, they gave him way,"
6727,XV,"Eager heads to left and right,"
6728,XV,"Like the bearded standard, thrust,"
6729,XV,"As in battle, for a nod"
6730,XV,From their lord of battle-dust.
6731,XV,"Attila, my Attila!"
6732,XV,Slow between the lines he trod.
6733,XV,Saw ye not the sun drop slow
6734,XV,"On this nuptial day, ere eve"
6735,XV,Pierced him on the couch aglow?
6736,XV,"Attila, my Attila!"
6737,XV,Here and there his heart would cleave
6738,XV,Clotted memory for a space:
6739,XV,"Some stout chief’s familiar face,"
6740,XV,"Choicest of his fighting brood,"
6741,XV,"Touched him, as ’twere one to know"
6742,XV,Ere he met his bride’s embrace.
6743,XV,"Attila, my Attila!"
6744,XV,Twisting fingers in a beard
6745,XV,"Scant as winter underwood,"
6746,XV,With a narrowed eye he peered;
6747,XV,Like the sunset’s graver red
6748,XV,Up old pine-stems.  Grave he stood
6749,XV,Eyeing them on whom was shed
6750,XV,Burning light from him alone.
6751,XV,"Attila, my Attila!"
6752,XV,Red were they whose mouths recalled
6753,XV,"Where the slaughter mounted high,"
6754,XV,"High on it, o’er earth appalled,"
6755,XV,He; heaven’s finger in their sight
6756,XV,"Raising him on waves of dead,"
6757,XV,Up to heaven his trumpets blown.
6758,XV,O for the time when God’s delight
6759,XV,Crowned the head of Attila!
6760,XV,Hungry river of the crag
6761,XV,Stretching hands for earth he came:
6762,XV,Force and Speed astride his name
6763,XV,Pointed back to spear and flag.
6764,XV,"He came out of miracle cloud,"
6765,XV,Lightning-swift and spectre-lean.
6766,XV,Now those days are in a shroud:
6767,XV,Have him to his ghostly queen.
6768,XV,Make the bed for Attila!
6769,XV,
6770,XV,
6771,XVI,XVI
6772,XVI,
6773,XVI,
6774,XVI,"One, with winecups overstrung,"
6775,XVI,Cried him farewell in Rome’s tongue.
6776,XVI,Who? for the great king turned as though
6777,XVI,Wrath to the shaft’s head strained the bow.
6778,XVI,"Nay, not wrath the king possessed,"
6779,XVI,But a radiance of the breast.
6780,XVI,In that sound he had the key
6781,XVI,Of his cunning malady.
6782,XVI,"Lo, where gleamed the sapphire lake,"
6783,XVI,"Leo, with his Rome at stake,"
6784,XVI,Drew blank air to hues and forms;
6785,XVI,"Whereof Two that shone distinct,"
6786,XVI,"Linked as orbed stars are linked,"
6787,XVI,"Clear among the myriad swarms,"
6788,XVI,"In a constellation, dashed"
6789,XVI,Full on horse and rider’s eyes
6790,XVI,"Sunless light, but light it was—"
6791,XVI,"Light that blinded and abashed,"
6792,XVI,"Froze his members, bade him pause,"
6793,XVI,"Caught him mid-gallop, blazed him home."
6794,XVI,"Attila, my Attila!"
6795,XVI,What are streams that cease to flow?
6796,XVI,"What was Attila, rolled thence,"
6797,XVI,Cheated by a juggler’s show?
6798,XVI,"Like that lake of blue intense,"
6799,XVI,"Under tempest lashed to foam,"
6800,XVI,"Lurid radiance, as he passed,"
6801,XVI,"Filled him, and around was glassed,"
6802,XVI,"When deep-voiced he uttered, Rome!"
6803,XVI,
6804,XVI,
6805,XVII,XVII
6806,XVII,
6807,XVII,
6808,XVII,Rome! the word was: and like meat
6809,XVII,Flung to dogs the word was torn.
6810,XVII,Soon Rome’s magic priests shall bleat
6811,XVII,Round their magic Pope forlorn!
6812,XVII,Loud they swore the king had sworn
6813,XVII,"Vengeance on the Roman cheat,"
6814,XVII,"Ere he passed, as, grave and still,"
6815,XVII,Danube through the shouting hill:
6816,XVII,Sworn it by his naked life!
6817,XVII,"Eagle, snakes these women are:"
6818,XVII,"Take them on the wing! but war,"
6819,XVII,Smoking war’s the warrior’s wife!
6820,XVII,Then for plunder! then for brides
6821,XVII,Won without a winking priest!—
6822,XVII,Danube whirled his train of tides
6823,XVII,Black toward the yellow East.
6824,XVII,Make the bed for Attila!
6825,XVII,
6826,XVII,
6827,XVIII,XVIII
6828,XVIII,
6829,XVIII,
6830,XVIII,"Chirrups of the trot afield,"
6831,XVIII,"Hurrahs of the battle-charge,"
6832,XVIII,"How they answered, how they pealed,"
6833,XVIII,When the morning rose and drew
6834,XVIII,"Bow and javelin, lance and targe,"
6835,XVIII,In the nuptial casement’s view!
6836,XVIII,"Attila, my Attila!"
6837,XVIII,"Down the hillspurs, out of tents"
6838,XVIII,"Glimmering in mid-forest, through"
6839,XVIII,"Mists of the cool morning scents,"
6840,XVIII,"Forth from city-alley, court,"
6841,XVIII,"Arch, the bounding horsemen flew,"
6842,XVIII,"Joined along the plains of dew,"
6843,XVIII,"Raced and gave the rein to sport,"
6844,XVIII,Closed and streamed like curtain-rents
6845,XVIII,"Fluttered by a wind, and flowed"
6846,XVIII,"Into squadrons: trumpets blew,"
6847,XVIII,"Chargers neighed, and trappings glowed"
6848,XVIII,Brave as the bright Orient’s.
6849,XVIII,Look on the seas that run to greet
6850,XVIII,Sunrise: look on the leagues of wheat:
6851,XVIII,Look on the lines and squares that fret
6852,XVIII,Leaping to level the lance blood-wet.
6853,XVIII,"Tens of thousands, man and steed,"
6854,XVIII,Tossing like field-flowers in Spring;
6855,XVIII,Ready to be hurled at need
6856,XVIII,Whither their great lord may sling.
6857,XVIII,"Finger Romeward, Romeward, King!"
6858,XVIII,"Attila, my Attila!"
6859,XVIII,Still the woman holds him fast
6860,XVIII,As a night-flag round the mast.
6861,XVIII,
6862,XVIII,
6863,XIX,XIX
6864,XIX,
6865,XIX,
6866,XIX,"Nigh upon the fiery noon,"
6867,XIX,Out of ranks a roaring burst.
6868,XIX,’Ware white women like the moon!
6869,XIX,They are poison: they have thirst
6870,XIX,"First for love, and next for rule."
6871,XIX,"Jealous of the army, she?"
6872,XIX,"Ho, the little wanton fool!"
6873,XIX,We were his before she squealed
6874,XIX,"Blind for mother’s milk, and heeled"
6875,XIX,Kicking on her mother’s knee.
6876,XIX,His in life and death are we:
6877,XIX,She but one flower of a field.
6878,XIX,We have given him bliss tenfold
6879,XIX,In an hour to match her night:
6880,XIX,"Attila, my Attila!"
6881,XIX,"Still her arms the master hold,"
6882,XIX,As on wounds the scarf winds tight.

6885,XX,XX
6886,XX,
6887,XX,
6888,XX,"Over Danube day no more,"
6889,XX,"Like the warrior’s planted spear,"
6890,XX,Stood to hail the King: in fear
6891,XX,Western day knocked at his door.
6892,XX,"Attila, my Attila!"
6893,XX,Sudden in the army’s eyes
6894,XX,Rolled a blast of lights and cries:
6895,XX,Flashing through them: Dead are ye!
6896,XX,"Dead, ye Huns, and torn piecemeal!"
6897,XX,See the ordered army reel
6898,XX,"Stricken through the ribs: and see,"
6899,XX,"Wild for speed to cheat despair,"
6900,XX,"Horsemen, clutching knee to chin,"
6901,XX,Crouch and dart they know not where.
6902,XX,"Attila, my Attila!"
6903,XX,"Faces covered, faces bare,"
6904,XX,Light the palace-front like jets
6905,XX,Of a dreadful fire within.
6906,XX,Beating hands and driving hair
6907,XX,Start on roof and parapets.
6908,XX,Dust rolls up; the slaughter din.
6909,XX,—Death to them who call him dead!
6910,XX,Death to them who doubt the tale!
6911,XX,"Choking in his dusty veil,"
6912,XX,Sank the sun on his death-bed.
6913,XX,Make the bed for Attila!
6914,XX,
6915,XX,
6916,XXI,XXI
6917,XXI,
6918,XXI,
6919,XXI,’Tis the room where thunder sleeps.
6920,XXI,"Frenzy, as a wave to shore"
6921,XXI,"Surging, burst the silent door,"
6922,XXI,And drew back to awful deeps
6923,XXI,"Breath beaten out, foam-white.  Anew"
6924,XXI,"Howled and pressed the ghastly crew,"
6925,XXI,Like storm-waters over rocks.
6926,XXI,"Attila, my Attila!"
6927,XXI,One long shaft of sunset red
6928,XXI,Laid a finger on the bed.
6929,XXI,"Horror, with the snaky locks,"
6930,XXI,"Shocked the surge to stiffened heaps,"
6931,XXI,Hoary as the glacier’s head
6932,XXI,Faced to the moon.  Insane they look.
6933,XXI,God it is in heaven who weeps
6934,XXI,Fallen from his hand the Scourge he shook.
6935,XXI,Make the bed for Attila!
6936,XXI,
6937,XXI,
6938,XXII,XXII
6939,XXII,
6940,XXII,
6941,XXII,"Square along the couch, and stark,"
6942,XXII,Like the sea-rejected thing
6943,XXII,"Sea-sucked white, behold their King."
6944,XXII,"Attila, my Attila!"
6945,XXII,"Beams that panted black and bright,"
6946,XXII,Scornful lightnings danced their sight:
6947,XXII,"Him they see an oak in bud,"
6948,XXII,Him an oaklog stripped of bark:
6949,XXII,"Him, their lord of day and night,"
6950,XXII,"White, and lifting up his blood"
6951,XXII,"Dumb for vengeance.  Name us that,"
6952,XXII,Huddled in the corner dark
6953,XXII,"Humped and grinning like a cat,"
6954,XXII,"Teeth for lips!—’tis she! she stares,"
6955,XXII,Glittering through her bristled hairs.
6956,XXII,Rend her!  Pierce her to the hilt!
6957,XXII,She is Murder: have her out!
6958,XXII,"What! this little fist, as big"
6959,XXII,As the southern summer fig!
6960,XXII,"She is Madness, none may doubt."
6961,XXII,"Death, who dares deny her guilt!"
6962,XXII,"Death, who says his blood she spilt!"
6963,XXII,Make the bed for Attila!
6964,XXII,
6965,XXII,
6966,XXIII,XXIII
6967,XXIII,
6968,XXIII,
6969,XXIII,Torch and lamp and sunset-red
6970,XXIII,Fell three-fingered on the bed.
6971,XXIII,In the torch the beard-hair scant
6972,XXIII,With the great breast seemed to pant:
6973,XXIII,In the yellow lamp the limbs
6974,XXIII,"Wavered, as the lake-flower swims:"
6975,XXIII,In the sunset red the dead
6976,XXIII,"Dead avowed him, dry blood-red."
6977,XXIII,
6978,XXIII,
6979,XXIV,XXIV
6980,XXIV,
6981,XXIV,
6982,XXIV,"Hatred of that abject slave,"
6983,XXIV,"Earth, was in each chieftain’s heart."
6984,XXIV,"Earth has got him, whom God gave,"
6985,XXIV,"Earth may sing, and earth shall smart!"
6986,XXIV,"Attila, my Attila!"
6987,XXIV,
6988,XXIV,
6989,XXV,XXV
6990,XXV,
6991,XXV,
6992,XXV,Thus their prayer was raved and ceased.
6993,XXV,Then had Vengeance of her feast
6994,XXV,Scent in their quick pang to smite
6995,XXV,"Which they knew not, but huge pain"
6996,XXV,Urged them for some victim slain
6997,XXV,"Swift, and blotted from the sight."
6998,XXV,"Each at each, a crouching beast,"
6999,XXV,"Glared, and quivered for the word."
7000,XXV,"Each at each, and all on that,"
7001,XXV,"Humped and grinning like a cat,"
7002,XXV,Head-bound with its bridal-wreath.
7003,XXV,Then the bitter chamber heard
7004,XXV,Vengeance in a cauldron seethe.
7005,XXV,Hurried counsel rage and craft
7006,XXV,"Yelped to hungry men, whose teeth"
7007,XXV,"Hard the grey lip-ringlet gnawed,"
7008,XXV,Gleaming till their fury laughed.
7009,XXV,"With the steel-hilt in the clutch,"
7010,XXV,Eyes were shot on her that froze
7011,XXV,In their blood-thirst overawed;
7012,XXV,"Burned to rend, yet feared to touch."
7013,XXV,"She that was his nuptial rose,"
7014,XXV,She was of his heart’s blood clad:
7015,XXV,Oh! the last of him she had!—
7016,XXV,Could a little fist as big
7017,XXV,"As the southern summer fig,"
7018,XXV,Push a dagger’s point to pierce
7019,XXV,Ribs like those?  Who else!  They glared
7020,XXV,Each at each.  Suspicion fierce
7021,XXV,Many a black remembrance bared.
7022,XXV,"Attila, my Attila!"
7023,XXV,"Death, who dares deny her guilt!"
7024,XXV,"Death, who says his blood she spilt!"
7025,XXV,"Traitor he, who stands between!"
7026,XXV,"Swift to hell, who harms the Queen!"
7027,XXV,"She, the wild contention’s cause,"
7028,XXV,Combed her hair with quiet paws.
7029,XXV,Make the bed for Attila!
7030,XXV,
7031,XXV,
7032,XXVI,XXVI
7033,XXVI,
7034,XXVI,
7035,XXVI,Night was on the host in arms.
7036,XXVI,"Night, as never night before,"
7037,XXVI,Hearkened to an army’s roar
7038,XXVI,Breaking up in snaky swarms:
7039,XXVI,"Torch and steel and snorting steed,"
7040,XXVI,"Hunted by the cry of blood,"
7041,XXVI,"Cursed with blindness, mad for day."
7042,XXVI,"Where the torches ran a flood,"
7043,XXVI,Tales of him and of the deed
7044,XXVI,Showered like a torrent spray.
7045,XXVI,Fear of silence made them strive
7046,XXVI,Loud in warrior-hymns that grew
7047,XXVI,Hoarse for slaughter yet unwreaked.
7048,XXVI,"Ghostly Night across the hive,"
7049,XXVI,With a crimson finger drew
7050,XXVI,Letters on her breast and shrieked.
7051,XXVI,Night was on them like the mould
7052,XXVI,On the buried half alive.
7053,XXVI,"Night, their bloody Queen, her fold"
7054,XXVI,Wound on them and struck them through.
7055,XXVI,Make the bed for Attila!

7071,XXVIII,Thus their prayer was raved and passed:
7072,XXVIII,Passed in peace their red sunset:
7073,XXVIII,Hewn and earthed those men of sweat
7074,XXVIII,"Who had housed him in the vast,"
7075,XXVIII,"Where no mortal might declare,"
7076,XXVIII,There lies he—his end was there!

7083,XXIX,Kingless was the army left:
7084,XXIX,Of its head the race bereft.
7085,XXIX,Every fury of the pit
7086,XXIX,Tortured and dismembered it.
7087,XXIX,"Lo, upon a silent hour,"
7088,XXIX,"When the pitch of frost subsides,"
7089,XXIX,Danube with a shout of power
7090,XXIX,Loosens his imprisoned tides:
7091,XXIX,Wide around the frighted plains
7092,XXIX,"Shake to hear his riven chains,"
7093,XXIX,"Dreadfuller than heaven in wrath,"
7094,XXIX,As he makes himself a path:
7095,XXIX,"High leap the ice-cracks, towering pile"
7096,XXIX,"Floes to bergs, and giant peers"
7097,XXIX,Wrestle on a drifted isle;
7098,XXIX,Island on ice-island rears;
7099,XXIX,Dissolution battles fast:
7100,XXIX,"Big the senseless Titans loom,"
7101,XXIX,Through a mist of common doom
7102,XXIX,Striving which shall die the last:
7103,XXIX,Till a gentle-breathing morn
7104,XXIX,Frees the stream from bank to bank.
7105,XXIX,So the Empire built of scorn
7106,XXIX,"Agonized, dissolved and sank."
7107,XXIX,Of the Queen no more was told
7108,XXIX,Than of leaf on Danube rolled.
7109,XXIX,Make the bed for Attila!

7625,XI,"He heard historic echoes moan his name,"

8028,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"With voracious roaring southward, where aslant, insufferable,"
8029,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,The bright steeds careered their parched way down an arc of the

8031,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"For the day grew like to thick night, and the orb was its beacon-fire,"
8032,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,And from hill to hill of darkness burst the day’s apparition forth.
8033,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Lo, a wrestler, not a God, stood in the chariot ever lowering:"

8038,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Lo, lo, increasing lustre, torrid breath to the nostrils; lo,"
8039,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Torrid brilliancies thro’ the vapours lighten swifter, penetrate them,"
8040,ATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASURE,"Fasten merciless, ruminant, hueless, on earth’s frame crackling"

8345,THE SOUTH-WESTER,A milky cloud went all to flame.
8346,THE SOUTH-WESTER,And there were groups where silvery springs

8406,THE SOUTH-WESTER,Their God to lead the glittering throng:
8407,THE SOUTH-WESTER,At whiles a beat of forest gong;
8408,THE SOUTH-WESTER,At whiles a glimpse of Python slain.
8409,THE SOUTH-WESTER,"Mostly divinest harmony,"
8410,THE SOUTH-WESTER,"The lyre, the dance.  We could believe"
8411,THE SOUTH-WESTER,"A life in orb and brook and tree,"
8412,THE SOUTH-WESTER,And cloud; and still holds Memory
8413,THE SOUTH-WESTER,A morning in the eyes of eve.

8417,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY
8418,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8419,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8420,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"I KNOW him, February’s thrush,"
8421,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,And loud at eve he valentines
8422,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,On sprays that paw the naked bush
8423,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Where soon will sprout the thorns and bines.
8424,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8425,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Now ere the foreign singer thrills
8426,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Our vale his plain-song pipe he pours,"
8427,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,A herald of the million bills;
8428,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"And heed him not, the loss is yours."
8429,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8430,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"My study, flanked with ivied fir"
8431,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"And budded beech with dry leaves curled,"
8432,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Perched over yew and juniper,"
8433,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"He neighbours, piping to his world:—"
8434,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8435,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"The wooded pathways dank on brown,"
8436,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"The branches on grey cloud a web,"
8437,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"The long green roller of the down,"
8438,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,An image of the deluge-ebb:—
8439,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8440,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"And farther, they may hear along"
8441,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The stream beneath the poplar row.
8442,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"By fits, like welling rocks, the song"
8443,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Spouts of a blushful Spring in flow.
8444,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8445,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,But most he loves to front the vale
8446,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,When waves of warm South-western rains
8447,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Have left our heavens clear in pale,"
8448,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,With faintest beck of moist red veins:
8449,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8450,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Vermilion wings, by distance held"
8451,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,To pause aflight while fleeting swift:
8452,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,And high aloft the pearl inshelled
8453,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Her lucid glow in glow will lift;
8454,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8455,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,A little south of coloured sky;
8456,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Directing, gravely amorous,"
8457,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The human of a tender eye
8458,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Through pure celestial on us:
8459,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8460,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Remote, not alien; still, not cold;"
8461,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Unraying yet, more pearl than star;"
8462,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,She seems a while the vale to hold
8463,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"In trance, and homelier makes the far."
8464,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8465,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Then Earth her sweet unscented breathes,"
8466,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,An orb of lustre quits the height;
8467,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"And like blue iris-flags, in wreaths"
8468,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"The sky takes darkness, long ere quite."
8469,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8470,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"His Island voice then shall you hear,"
8471,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Nor ever after separate
8472,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,From such a twilight of the year
8473,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Advancing to the vernal gate.
8474,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8475,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"He sings me, out of Winter’s throat,"
8476,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The young time with the life ahead;
8477,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,And my young time his leaping note
8478,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Recalls to spirit-mirth from dead.
8479,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8480,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Imbedded in a land of greed,"
8481,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Of mammon-quakings dire as Earth’s,"
8482,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,My care was but to soothe my need;
8483,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,At peace among the littleworths.
8484,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8485,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,To light and song my yearning aimed;
8486,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,To that deep breast of song and light
8487,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Which men have barrenest proclaimed;
8488,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,As ’tis to senses pricked with fright.
8489,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8490,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,So mine are these new fruitings rich
8491,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The simple to the common brings;
8492,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,I keep the youth of souls who pitch
8493,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Their joy in this old heart of things:
8494,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8495,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Who feel the Coming young as aye,"
8496,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Thrice hopeful on the ground we plough;
8497,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Alive for life, awake to die;"
8498,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,One voice to cheer the seedling Now.
8499,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8500,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Full lasting is the song, though he,"
8501,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"The singer, passes: lasting too,"
8502,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"For souls not lent in usury,"
8503,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The rapture of the forward view.
8504,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8505,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,With that I bear my senses fraught
8506,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Till what I am fast shoreward drives.
8507,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,They are the vessel of the Thought.
8508,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"The vessel splits, the Thought survives."
8509,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8510,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Nought else are we when sailing brave,"
8511,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Save husks to raise and bid it burn.
8512,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Glimpse of its livingness will wave
8513,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,A light the senses can discern
8514,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8515,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Across the river of the death,"
8516,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Their close.  Meanwhile, O twilight bird"
8517,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Of promise! bird of happy breath!
8518,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"I hear, I would the City heard."
8519,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8520,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The City of the smoky fray;
8521,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"A prodded ox, it drags and moans:"
8522,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Its Morrow no man’s child; its Day
8523,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,A vulture’s morsel beaked to bones.
8524,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8525,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,It strives without a mark for strife;
8526,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,It feasts beside a famished host:
8527,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"The loose restraint of wanton life,"
8528,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,That threatened penance in the ghost!
8529,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8530,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Yet there our battle urges; there
8531,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Spring heroes many: issuing thence,"
8532,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Names that should leave no vacant air
8533,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,For fresh delight in confidence.
8534,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8535,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Life was to them the bag of grain,"
8536,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,And Death the weedy harrow’s tooth.
8537,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Those warriors of the sighting brain
8538,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Give worn Humanity new youth.
8539,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8540,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Our song and star are they to lead
8541,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The tidal multitude and blind
8542,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,From bestial to the higher breed
8543,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"By fighting souls of love divined,"
8544,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8545,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"They scorned the ventral dream of peace,"
8546,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Unknown in nature.  This they knew:
8547,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,That life begets with fair increase
8548,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Beyond the flesh, if life be true."
8549,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8550,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Just reason based on valiant blood,"
8551,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The instinct bred afield would match
8552,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"To pipe thereof a swelling flood,"
8553,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Were men of Earth made wise in watch.
8554,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8555,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Though now the numbers count as drops
8556,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"An urn might bear, they father Time."
8557,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,She shapes anew her dusty crops;
8558,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Her quick in their own likeness climb.
8559,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8560,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Of their own force do they create;
8561,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"They climb to light, in her their root."
8562,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Your brutish cry at muffled fate
8563,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,She smites with pangs of worse than brute.
8564,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8565,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"She, judged of shrinking nerves, appears"
8566,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,A Mother whom no cry can melt;
8567,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"But read her past desires and fears,"
8568,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The letters on her breast are spelt.
8569,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8570,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"A slayer, yea, as when she pressed"
8571,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Her savage to the slaughter-heaps,"
8572,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,To sacrifice she prompts her best:
8573,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,She reaps them as the sower reaps.
8574,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8575,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"But read her thought to speed the race,"
8576,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,And stars rush forth of blackest night:
8577,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,You chill not at a cold embrace
8578,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"To come, nor dread a dubious might."
8579,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8580,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Her double visage, double voice,"
8581,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,In oneness rise to quench the doubt.
8582,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"This breath, her gift, has only choice"
8583,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Of service, breathe we in or out."
8584,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8585,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Since Pain and Pleasure on each hand
8586,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Led our wild steps from slimy rock
8587,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"To yonder sweeps of gardenland,"
8588,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,We breathe but to be sword or block.
8589,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8590,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The sighting brain her good decree
8591,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Accepts; obeys those guides, in faith,"
8592,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"By reason hourly fed, that she,"
8593,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"To some the clod, to some the wraith,"
8594,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8595,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Is more, no mask; a flame, a stream."
8596,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Flame, stream, are we, in mid career"
8597,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"From torrent source, delirious dream,"
8598,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,To heaven-reflecting currents clear.
8599,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8600,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,And why the sons of Strength have been
8601,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Her cherished offspring ever; how
8602,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The Spirit served by her is seen
8603,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Through Law; perusing love will show.
8604,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8605,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Love born of knowledge, love that gains"
8606,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Vitality as Earth it mates,"
8607,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"The meaning of the Pleasures, Pains,"
8608,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"The Life, the Death, illuminates."
8609,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8610,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"For love we Earth, then serve we all;"
8611,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,Her mystic secret then is ours:
8612,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"We fall, or view our treasures fall,"
8613,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Unclouded, as beholds her flowers"
8614,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,
8615,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Earth, from a night of frosty wreck,"
8616,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"Enrobed in morning’s mounted fire,"
8617,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,"When lowly, with a broken neck,"
8618,THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARY,The crocus lays her cheek to mire.

8632,I,"The wheat, vine, olive, ripe to Summer’s ray."

8645,II,Or why men drew the breath to carry pain.
8646,II,"High reared the ploughshare, broken lay the wain,"

8656,III,Pursued the flowers that were not with dry bags;
8657,III,"Sole sound aloud the snap of sapless trees,"
8658,III,More sharp than slingstones on hard breastplates hurled.
8659,III,"Back to first chaos tumbled the stopped world,"
8660,III,Careless to lure or please.

8671,IV,"And whose pale place of habitation mute,"
8672,IV,"She and all seemed where Seasons, pledged for fruit"

8723,VIII,"Relentlessly their gold-haired Heaven, their fount"
8724,VIII,"Bountiful of old days, heard them recount"

8749,X,The wrecks of horse and mare: such ribs as view

8774,XII,"Her hands held out like bearers of the flame,"
8775,XII,And nodded for the negative sideways.
8776,XII,Keen at her Mistress glanced Iambe: rays

8785,XIII,"Like thunder of the song of heart: her face,"
8786,XIII,"The dreadful darkness, shook to mounted sun,"
8787,XIII,And peal on peal across the hills held chase.
8788,XIII,She laughed herself to water; laughed to fire;
8789,XIII,Laughed the torrential laugh of dam and sire
8790,XIII,Full of the marrowy race.

8800,XIV,Unwitting happiness till golden rains
8801,XIV,"Of tears in laughter, laughter weeping, smote"
8802,XIV,Knowledge of milky mercy from that throat
8803,XIV,Pouring to heal their pains:

9239,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Thrifty, deft-handed to ply"
9240,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Shuttle or needle, and woo"
9241,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Sun to the roots of the pear
9242,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Frogging each mud-walled cot.

9273,A FAITH ON TRIAL,At a foreign and stony sun.
9274,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9275,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Eyes had I but for the scene
9276,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Of my circle, what neighbourly grew."
9277,A FAITH ON TRIAL,If haply no finger lay out
9278,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To the figures of days that had been,"
9279,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"I gathered my herb, and endured;"
9280,A FAITH ON TRIAL,My old cloak wrapped me about.
9281,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Unfooted was ground-ivy blue,"
9282,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Whose rustic shrewd odour allured
9283,A FAITH ON TRIAL,In Spring’s fresh of morning: unseen
9284,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Her favourite wood-sorrel bell
9285,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"As yet, though the leaves’ green floor"
9286,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Awaited their flower, that would tell"
9287,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Of a red-veined moist yestreen,"
9288,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With its droop and the hues it wore,"
9289,A FAITH ON TRIAL,When we two stood overnight
9290,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"One, in the dark van-glow"
9291,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"On our hill-top, seeing beneath"
9292,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Our household’s twinkle of light

9294,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9295,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Budding, the service-tree, white"
9296,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Almost as whitebeam, threw,"
9297,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"From the under of leaf upright,"
9298,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Flecks like a showering snow
9299,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"On the flame-shaped junipers green,"
9300,A FAITH ON TRIAL,On the sombre mounds of the yew.
9301,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Like silvery tapers bright
9302,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"By a solemn cathedral screen,"
9303,A FAITH ON TRIAL,They glistened to closer view.
9304,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Turf for a rooks’ revel striped
9305,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Pleased those devourers astute.
9306,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Chorister blackbird and thrush
9307,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Together or alternate piped;
9308,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"A free-hearted harmony large,"
9309,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With meaning for man, for brute,"
9310,A FAITH ON TRIAL,When the primitive forces are brimmed.
9311,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Like featherings hither and yon
9312,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Of aëry tree-twigs over marge,"
9313,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To the comb of the winds, untrimmed,"
9314,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Their measure is found in the vast.
9315,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Grief heard them, and stepped her way on."
9316,A FAITH ON TRIAL,She has but a narrow embrace.
9317,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Distrustful of hearing she passed.
9318,A FAITH ON TRIAL,They piped her young Earth’s Bacchic rout;
9319,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The race, and the prize of the race;"
9320,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Earth’s lustihead pressing to sprout.
9321,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9322,A FAITH ON TRIAL,But sight holds a soberer space.
9323,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Colourless dogwood low
9324,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Curled up a twisted root,"
9325,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Nigh yellow-green mosses, to flush"
9326,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Redder than sun upon rocks,"
9327,A FAITH ON TRIAL,When the creeper clematis-shoot
9328,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Shall climb, cap his branches, and show,"
9329,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Beside veteran green of the box,"
9330,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"At close of the year’s maple blush,"
9331,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"A bleeding greybeard is he,"
9332,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Now hale in the leafage lush.
9333,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Our parasites paint us.  Hard by,"
9334,A FAITH ON TRIAL,A wet yew-trunk flashed the peel
9335,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Of our naked forefathers in fight;
9336,A FAITH ON TRIAL,With stains of the fray sweating free;
9337,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And him came no parasite nigh:
9338,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Firm on the hard knotted knee,"
9339,A FAITH ON TRIAL,He stood in the crown of his dun;
9340,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Earth’s toughest to stay her wheel:
9341,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Under whom the full day is night;
9342,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Whom the century-tempests call son,"
9343,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Having striven to rend him in vain.
9344,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9345,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"I walked to observe, not to feel,"
9346,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Not to fancy, if simple of eye"
9347,A FAITH ON TRIAL,One may be among images reaped
9348,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For a shift of the glance, as grain:"
9349,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Profitless froth you espy
9350,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Ashore after billows have leaped.
9351,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"I fled nothing, nothing pursued:"
9352,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The changeful visible face
9353,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Of our Mother I sought for my food;
9354,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Crumbs by the way to sustain.
9355,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Her sentence I knew past grace.
9356,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Myself I had lost of us twain,"
9357,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Once bound in mirroring thought.
9358,A FAITH ON TRIAL,She had flung me to dust in her wake;
9359,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And I, as your convict drags"
9360,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"His chain, by the scourge untaught,"
9361,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Bore life for a goad, without aim."
9362,A FAITH ON TRIAL,I champed the sensations that make
9363,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Of a ruffled philosophy rags.
9364,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For them was no meaning too blunt,"
9365,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Nor aspect too cutting of steel.
9366,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"This Earth of the beautiful breasts,"
9367,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Shining up in all colours aflame,"
9368,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To them had visage of hags:
9369,A FAITH ON TRIAL,A Mother of aches and jests:
9370,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Soulless, heading a hunt"
9371,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Aimless except for the meal.
9372,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Hope, with the star on her front;"
9373,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Fear, with an eye in the heel;"
9374,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Our links to a Mother of grace;
9375,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"They were dead on the nerve, and dead"
9376,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For the nature divided in three;
9377,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Gone out of heart, out of brain,"
9378,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Out of soul: I had in their place
9379,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The calm of an empty room.
9380,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"We were joined but by that thin thread,"
9381,A FAITH ON TRIAL,My disciplined habit to see.
9382,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And those conjure images, those,"
9383,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The puppets of loss or gain;
9384,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Not he who is bare to his doom;
9385,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For whom never semblance plays
9386,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To bewitch, overcloud, illume."
9387,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The dusty mote-images rose;
9388,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Sheer film of the surface awag:
9389,A FAITH ON TRIAL,They sank as they rose; their pain
9390,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Declaring them mine of old days.
9391,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9392,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Now gazed I where, sole upon gloom,"
9393,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"As flower-bush in sun-specked crag,"
9394,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Up the spine of the double combe
9395,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With yew-boughs heavily cloaked,"
9396,A FAITH ON TRIAL,A young apparition shone:
9397,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Known, yet wonderful, white"
9398,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Surpassingly; doubtfully known,"
9399,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For it struck as the birth of Light:
9400,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Even Day from the dark unyoked.
9401,A FAITH ON TRIAL,It waved like a pilgrim flag
9402,A FAITH ON TRIAL,O’er processional penitents flown
9403,A FAITH ON TRIAL,When of old they broke rounding yon spine:
9404,A FAITH ON TRIAL,O the pure wild-cherry in bloom!
9405,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9406,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For their Eastward march to the shrine
9407,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Of the footsore far-eyed Faith,"
9408,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Was banner so brave, so fair,"
9409,A FAITH ON TRIAL,So quick with celestial sign
9410,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Of victorious rays over death?
9411,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For a conquest of coward despair;—
9412,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Division of soul from wits,"
9413,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And these made rulers;—full sure,"
9414,A FAITH ON TRIAL,More starlike never did shine
9415,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To illumine the sinister field
9416,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Where our life’s old night-bird flits.
9417,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"I knew it: with her, my own,"
9418,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Had hailed it pure of the pure;
9419,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Our beacon yearly: but strange
9420,A FAITH ON TRIAL,When it strikes to within is the known;
9421,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Richer than newness revealed.
9422,A FAITH ON TRIAL,There was needed darkness like mine.
9423,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Its beauty to vividness blown
9424,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Drew the life in me forward, chased,"
9425,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"From aloft on a pinnacle’s range,"
9426,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"That hindward spidery line,"
9427,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The length of the ways I had paced,"
9428,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"A footfarer out of the dawn,"
9429,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To Youth’s wild forest, where sprang,"
9430,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For the morning of May long gone,"
9431,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The forest’s white virgin; she
9432,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Seen yonder; and sheltered me, sang;"
9433,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"She in me, I in her; what songs"
9434,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The fawn-eared wood-hollows revive
9435,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To pour forth their tune-footed throngs;
9436,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Inspire to the dreaming of good
9437,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Illimitable to come:
9438,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"She, the white wild cherry, a tree,"
9439,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Earth-rooted, tangibly wood,"
9440,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Yet a presence throbbing alive;
9441,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Nor she in our language dumb:
9442,A FAITH ON TRIAL,A spirit born of a tree;
9443,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Because earth-rooted alive:
9444,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Huntress of things worth pursuit
9445,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Of souls; in our naming, dreams."
9446,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And each unto other was lute,"
9447,A FAITH ON TRIAL,By fits quick as breezy gleams.
9448,A FAITH ON TRIAL,My quiver of aims and desires
9449,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Had colour that she would have owned;
9450,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And if by humaner fires
9451,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Hued later, these held her enthroned:"
9452,A FAITH ON TRIAL,My crescent of Earth; my blood
9453,A FAITH ON TRIAL,At the silvery early stir;
9454,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Hour of the thrill of the bud
9455,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"About to burst, and by her"
9456,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Directed, attuned, englobed:"
9457,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"My Goddess, the chaste, not chill;"
9458,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Choir over choir white-robed;
9459,A FAITH ON TRIAL,White-bosomed fold within fold:
9460,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For so could I dream, breast-bare,"
9461,A FAITH ON TRIAL,In my time of blooming; dream still
9462,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Through the maze, the mesh, and the wreck,"
9463,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Despite, since manhood was bold,"
9464,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The yoke of the flesh on my neck.
9465,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"She beckoned, I gazed, unaware"
9466,A FAITH ON TRIAL,How a shaft of the blossoming tree
9467,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Was shot from the yew-wood’s core.
9468,A FAITH ON TRIAL,I stood to the touch of a key
9469,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Turned in a fast-shut door.
9470,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9471,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"They rounded my garden, content,"
9472,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The small fry, clutching their fee,"
9473,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Their fruit of the wreath and the pole;
9474,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And, chatter, hop, skip, they were sent,"
9475,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"In a buzz of young company glee,"
9476,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Their natural music, swift shoal"
9477,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To the next easy shedders of pence.
9478,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Why not? for they had me in tune
9479,A FAITH ON TRIAL,With the hungers of my kind.
9480,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Do readings of earth draw thence,"
9481,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Then a concord deeper than cries
9482,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Of the Whither whose echo is Whence,"
9483,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To jar unanswered, shall rise"
9484,A FAITH ON TRIAL,As a fountain-jet in the mind
9485,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Bowed dark o’er the falling and strewn.
9486,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9487,A FAITH ON TRIAL,* * *
9488,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9489,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Unwitting where it might lead,"
9490,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"How it came, for the anguish to cease,"
9491,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And the Questions that sow not nor spin,"
9492,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"This wisdom, rough-written, and black,"
9493,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"As of veins that from venom bleed,"
9494,A FAITH ON TRIAL,I had with the peace within;
9495,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Or patience, mortal of peace,"
9496,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Compressing the surgent strife
9497,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"In a heart laid open, not mailed,"
9498,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To the last blank hour of the rack,"
9499,A FAITH ON TRIAL,When struck the dividing knife:
9500,A FAITH ON TRIAL,When the hand that never had failed
9501,A FAITH ON TRIAL,In its pressure to mine hung slack.
9502,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9503,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"But this in myself did I know,"
9504,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Not needing a studious brow,"
9505,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Or trust in a governing star,"
9506,A FAITH ON TRIAL,While my ears held the jangled shout
9507,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The children were lifting afar:
9508,A FAITH ON TRIAL,That natures at interflow
9509,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With all of their past and the now,"
9510,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Are chords to the Nature without,"
9511,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Orbs to the greater whole:
9512,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"First then, nor utterly then"
9513,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Till our lord of sensations at war,"
9514,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The rebel, the heart, yields place"
9515,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To brain, each prompting the soul."
9516,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Thus our dear Earth we embrace
9517,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For the milk, her strength to men."
9518,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9519,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And crave we her medical herb,"
9520,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"We have but to see and hear,"
9521,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Though pierced by the cruel acerb,"
9522,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The troops of the memories armed
9523,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Hostile to strike at the nest
9524,A FAITH ON TRIAL,That nourished and flew them warmed.
9525,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Not she gives the tear for the tear.
9526,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Weep, bleed, rave, writhe, be distraught,"
9527,A FAITH ON TRIAL,She is moveless.  Not of her breast
9528,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Are the symbols we conjure when Fear
9529,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Takes leaven of Hope.  I caught,"
9530,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With Death in me shrinking from Death,"
9531,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"As cold from cold, for a sign"
9532,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Of the life beyond ashes: I cast,"
9533,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Believing the vision divine,"
9534,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Wings of that dream of my Youth
9535,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To the spirit beloved: ’twas unglassed
9536,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"On her breast, in her depths austere:"
9537,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"A flash through the mist, mere breath,"
9538,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Breath on a buckler of steel.
9539,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For the flesh in revolt at her laws,"
9540,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Neither song nor smile in ruth,"
9541,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Nor promise of things to reveal,"
9542,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Has she, nor a word she saith:"
9543,A FAITH ON TRIAL,We are asking her wheels to pause.
9544,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Well knows she the cry of unfaith.
9545,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"If we strain to the farther shore,"
9546,A FAITH ON TRIAL,We are catching at comfort near.
9547,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Assurances, symbols, saws,"
9548,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Revelations in legends, light"
9549,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To eyes rolling darkness, these"
9550,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Desired of the flesh in affright,"
9551,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For the which it will swear to adore,"
9552,A FAITH ON TRIAL,She yields not for prayers at her knees;
9553,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The woolly beast bleating will shear.
9554,A FAITH ON TRIAL,These are our sensual dreams;
9555,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Of the yearning to touch, to feel"
9556,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The dark Impalpable sure,"
9557,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And have the Unveiled appear;
9558,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Whereon ever black she beams,"
9559,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Doth of her terrible deal,"
9560,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"She who dotes over ripeness at play,"
9561,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Rosiness fondles and feeds,"
9562,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Guides it with shepherding crook,"
9563,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To her sports and her pastures alway.
9564,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Not she gives the tear for the tear:
9565,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Harsh wisdom gives Earth, no more;"
9566,A FAITH ON TRIAL,In one the spur and the curb:
9567,A FAITH ON TRIAL,An answer to thoughts or deeds;
9568,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To the Legends an alien look;
9569,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To the Questions a figure of clay.
9570,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Yet we have but to see and hear,"
9571,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Crave we her medical herb.
9572,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For the road to her soul is the Real:
9573,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The root of the growth of man:
9574,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And the senses must traverse it fresh
9575,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With a love that no scourge shall abate,"
9576,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To reach the lone heights where we scan
9577,A FAITH ON TRIAL,In the mind’s rarer vision this flesh;
9578,A FAITH ON TRIAL,In the charge of the Mother our fate;
9579,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Her law as the one common weal.
9580,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9581,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"We, whom the view benumbs,"
9582,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"We, quivering upward, each hour"
9583,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Know battle in air and in ground
9584,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For the breath that goes as it comes,"
9585,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For the choice between sweet and sour,"
9586,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For the smallest grain of our worth:
9587,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And he who the reckoning sums
9588,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Finds nought in his hand save Earth.
9589,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Of Earth are we stripped or crowned.
9590,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The fleeting Present we crave,"
9591,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Barter our best to wed,"
9592,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"In hope of a cushioned bower,"
9593,A FAITH ON TRIAL,What is it but Future and Past
9594,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Like wind and tide at a wave!
9595,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Idea of the senses, bred"
9596,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For the senses to snap and devour:
9597,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Thin as the shell of a sound
9598,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"In delivery, withered in light."
9599,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Cry we for permanence fast,"
9600,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Permanence hangs by the grave;
9601,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Sits on the grave green-grassed,"
9602,A FAITH ON TRIAL,On the roll of the heaved grave-mound.
9603,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"By Death, as by Life, are we fed:"
9604,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The two are one spring; our bond
9605,A FAITH ON TRIAL,With the numbers; with whom to unite
9606,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Here feathers wings for beyond:
9607,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Only they can waft us in flight.
9608,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For they are Reality’s flower.
9609,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Of them, and the contact with them,"
9610,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Issues Earth’s dearest daughter, the firm"
9611,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"In footing, the stately of stem;"
9612,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Unshaken though elements lour;
9613,A FAITH ON TRIAL,A warrior heart unquelled;
9614,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Mirror of Earth, and guide"
9615,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To the Holies from sense withheld:
9616,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Reason, man’s germinant fruit."
9617,A FAITH ON TRIAL,She wrestles with our old worm
9618,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Self in the narrow and wide:
9619,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Relentless quencher of lies,"
9620,A FAITH ON TRIAL,With laughter she pierces the brute;
9621,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And hear we her laughter peal,"
9622,A FAITH ON TRIAL,’Tis Light in us dancing to scour
9623,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The loathed recess of his dens;
9624,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Scatter his monstrous bed,"
9625,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And hound him to harrow and plough.
9626,A FAITH ON TRIAL,She is the world’s one prize;
9627,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Our champion, rightfully head;"
9628,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The vessel whose piloted prow,"
9629,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Though Folly froth round, hiss and hoot,"
9630,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Leaves legible print at the keel.
9631,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Nor least is the service she does,"
9632,A FAITH ON TRIAL,That service to her may cleanse
9633,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The well of the Sorrows in us;
9634,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For a common delight will drain
9635,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The rank individual fens
9636,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Of a wound refusing to heal
9637,A FAITH ON TRIAL,While the old worm slavers its root.
9638,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9639,A FAITH ON TRIAL,I bowed as a leaf in rain;
9640,A FAITH ON TRIAL,As a tree when the leaf is shed
9641,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To winds in the season at wane:
9642,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And when from my soul I said,"
9643,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"May the worm be trampled: smite,"
9644,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Sacred Reality! power
9645,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Filled me to front it aright.
9646,A FAITH ON TRIAL,I had come of my faith’s ordeal.
9647,A FAITH ON TRIAL,
9648,A FAITH ON TRIAL,It is not to stand on a tower
9649,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And see the flat universe reel;
9650,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Our mortal sublimities drop
9651,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Like raiment by glisterlings worn,"
9652,A FAITH ON TRIAL,At a sweep of the scythe for the crop.
9653,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Wisdom is won of its fight,"
9654,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The combat incessant; and dries
9655,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To mummywrap perching a height.
9656,A FAITH ON TRIAL,It chews the contemplative cud
9657,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"In peril of isolate scorn,"
9658,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Unfed of the onward flood.
9659,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Nor view we a different morn
9660,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"If we gaze with the deeper sight,"
9661,A FAITH ON TRIAL,With the deeper thought forewise:
9662,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The world is the same, seen through;"
9663,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The features of men are the same.
9664,A FAITH ON TRIAL,But let their historian new
9665,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"In the language of nakedness write,"
9666,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Rejoice we to know not shame,"
9667,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Not a dread, not a doubt: to have done"
9668,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With the tortures of thought in the throes,"
9669,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Our animal tangle, and grasp"
9670,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Very sap of the vital in this:
9671,A FAITH ON TRIAL,That from flesh unto spirit man grows
9672,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Even here on the sod under sun:
9673,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"That she of the wanton’s kiss,"
9674,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Broken through with the bite of an asp,"
9675,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Is Mother of simple truth,"
9676,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Relentless quencher of lies;
9677,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Eternal in thought; discerned
9678,A FAITH ON TRIAL,In thought mid-ferry between
9679,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The Life and the Death, which are one,"
9680,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"As our breath in and out, joy or teen."
9681,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"She gives the rich vision to youth,"
9682,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"If we will, of her prompting wise;"
9683,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Or men by the lash made lean,"
9684,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Who in harness the mind subserve,"
9685,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Their title to read her have earned;
9686,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Having mastered sensation—insane
9687,A FAITH ON TRIAL,At a stroke of the terrified nerve;
9688,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And out of the sensual hive
9689,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Grown to the flower of brain;
9690,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To know her a thing alive,"
9691,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Whose aspects mutably swerve,"
9692,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Whose laws immutably reign.
9693,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Our sentencer, clother in mist,"
9694,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Her morn bends breast to her noon,"
9695,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Noon to the hour dark-dyed,"
9696,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"If we will, of her promptings wise:"
9697,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Her light is our own if we list.
9698,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The legends that sweep her aside,"
9699,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Crying loud for an opiate boon,"
9700,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To comfort the human want,"
9701,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"From the bosom of magical skies,"
9702,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"She smiles on, marking their source:"
9703,A FAITH ON TRIAL,They read her with infant eyes.
9704,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Good ships of morality they,"
9705,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For our crude developing force;
9706,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Granite the thought to stay,"
9707,A FAITH ON TRIAL,That she is a thing alive
9708,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To the living, the falling and strewn."
9709,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"But the Questions, the broods that haunt"
9710,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Sensation insurgent, may drive,"
9711,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The way of the channelling mole,"
9712,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Head in a ground-vault gaunt
9713,A FAITH ON TRIAL,As your telescope’s skeleton moon.
9714,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Barren comfort to these will she dole;
9715,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Dead is her face to their cries.
9716,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Intelligence pushing to taste
9717,A FAITH ON TRIAL,A lesson from beasts might heed.
9718,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"They scatter a voice in the waste,"
9719,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Where any dry swish of a reed

9722,A FAITH ON TRIAL,‘They see not above or below;
9723,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Farthest are they from my soul,’"
9724,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Earth whispers: ‘they scarce have the thirst,"
9725,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Except to unriddle a rune;
9726,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And I spin none; only show,"
9727,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Would humanity soar from its worst,"
9728,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Winged above darkness and dole,"
9729,A FAITH ON TRIAL,How flesh unto spirit must grow.
9730,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Spirit raves not for a goal.
9731,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Shapes in man’s likeness hewn
9732,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Desires not; neither desires
9733,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The sleep or the glory: it trusts;
9734,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Uses my gifts, yet aspires;"
9735,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Dreams of a higher than it.
9736,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The dream is an atmosphere;
9737,A FAITH ON TRIAL,A scale still ascending to knit
9738,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The clear to the loftier Clear.
9739,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"’Tis Reason herself, tiptoe"
9740,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"At the ultimate bound of her wit,"
9741,A FAITH ON TRIAL,On the verges of Night and Day.
9742,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"But is it a dream of the lusts,"
9743,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To my dustiest ’tis decreed;
9744,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And them that so shuffle astray
9745,A FAITH ON TRIAL,I touch with no key of gold
9746,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For the wealth of the secret nook;
9747,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Though I dote over ripeness at play,"
9748,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Rosiness fondle and feed,"
9749,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Guide it with shepherding crook
9750,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To my sports and my pastures alway.
9751,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The key will shriek in the lock,"
9752,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The door will rustily hinge,"
9753,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Will open on features of mould,"
9754,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To vanish corrupt at a glimpse,"
9755,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And mock as the wild echoes mock,"
9756,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Soulless in mimic, doth Greed"
9757,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Or the passion for fruitage tinge
9758,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"That dream, for your parricide imps"
9759,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To wing through the body of Time,"
9760,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Yourselves in slaying him slay.
9761,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Much are you shots of your prime,"
9762,A FAITH ON TRIAL,You men of the act and the dream:
9763,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And please you to fatten a weed
9764,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"That perishes, pledged to decay,"
9765,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"’Tis dearth in your season of need,"
9766,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Down the slopes of the shoreward way;—
9767,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Nigh on the misty stream,"
9768,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Where Ferryman under his hood,"
9769,A FAITH ON TRIAL,With a call to be ready to pay
9770,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The small coin, whitens red blood."
9771,A FAITH ON TRIAL,But the young ethereal seed
9772,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Shall bring you the bread no buyer
9773,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Can have for his craving supreme;
9774,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To my quenchless quick shall speed
9775,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The soul at her wrestle rude
9776,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With devil, with angel more dire;"
9777,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With the flesh, with the Fates, enringed."
9778,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The dream of the blossom of Good
9779,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Is your banner of battle unrolled
9780,A FAITH ON TRIAL,In its waver and current and curve
9781,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"(Choir over choir white-winged,"
9782,A FAITH ON TRIAL,White-bosomed fold within fold):
9783,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Hopeful of victory most
9784,A FAITH ON TRIAL,When hard is the task to sustain
9785,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Assaults of the fearful sense
9786,A FAITH ON TRIAL,At a mind in desolate mood
9787,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"With the Whither, whose echo is Whence;"
9788,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And humanity’s clamour, lost, lost;"
9789,A FAITH ON TRIAL,And its clasp of the staves that snap;
9790,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And evil abroad, as a main"
9791,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Uproarious, bursting its dyke."
9792,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"For back do you look, and lo,"
9793,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Forward the harvest of grain!—
9794,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Numbers in council, awake"
9795,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"To love more than things of my lap,"
9796,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Love me; and to let the types break,"
9797,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Men be grass, rocks rivers, all flow;"
9798,A FAITH ON TRIAL,All save the dream sink alike
9799,A FAITH ON TRIAL,To the source of my vital in sap:
9800,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Their battle, their loss, their ache,"
9801,A FAITH ON TRIAL,For my pledge of vitality know.
9802,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The dream is the thought in the ghost;
9803,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The thought sent flying for food;
9804,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Eyeless, but sprung of an aim"
9805,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Supernal of Reason, to find"
9806,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The great Over-Reason we name
9807,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Beneficence: mind seeking Mind.
9808,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"Dream of the blossom of Good,"
9809,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"In its waver and current and curve,"
9810,A FAITH ON TRIAL,With the hopes of my offspring enscrolled!
9811,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Soon to be seen of a host
9812,A FAITH ON TRIAL,The flag of the Master I serve!
9813,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"And life in them doubled on Life,"
9814,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"As flame upon flame, to behold,"
9815,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"High over Time-tumbled sea,"
9816,A FAITH ON TRIAL,"The bliss of his headship of strife,"
9817,A FAITH ON TRIAL,Him through handmaiden me.’

9827,I,I STOOD at the gate of the cot
9828,I,"Where my darling, with side-glance demure,"
9829,I,"Would spy, on her trim garden-plot,"
9830,I,The busy wild things chase and lure.
9831,I,For these with their ways were her feast;
9832,I,They had surety no enemy lurked.
9833,I,Their deftest of tricks to their least
9834,I,She gathered in watch as she worked.

9840,II,"When berries were red on her ash,"
9841,II,"The blackbird would rifle them rough,"
9842,II,"Till the ground underneath looked a gash,"
9843,II,And her rogue grew the round of a chough.
9844,II,"The squirrel cocked ear o’er his hoop,"
9845,II,"Up the spruce, quick as eye, trailing brush."
9846,II,She knew any tit of the troop
9847,II,All as well as the snail-tapping thrush.

9855,III,"No window a lute to my name,"
9856,III,No watcher there plying the thread.
9857,III,But the blackbird hung peeking at will;
9858,III,The squirrel from cone hopped to cone;
9859,III,"The thrush had a snail in his bill,"
9860,III,And tap-tapped the shell hard on a stone.

9872,I,"Through wooded vales the land of dawn we neared,"
9873,I,Where down smooth rapids whirls the helmless dream
9874,I,To fall on daylight; and night puts away

10036,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,WHAT links are ours with orbs that are
10037,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,So resolutely far:
10038,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"The solitary asks, and they"
10039,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Give radiance as from a shield:
10040,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Still at the death of day,"
10041,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"The seen, the unrevealed."
10042,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Implacable they shine
10043,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,To us who would of Life obtain
10044,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,An answer for the life we strain
10045,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,To nourish with one sign.
10046,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Nor can imagination throw
10047,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,The penetrative shaft: we pass
10048,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"The breath of thought, who would divine"
10049,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,If haply they may grow
10050,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,As Earth; have our desire to know;

10055,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"The mystic link attain,"
10056,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Whereby star holds on star.
10057,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,
10058,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Those visible immortals beam
10059,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Allurement to the dream:
10060,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Ireful at human hungers brook
10061,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,No question in the look.
10062,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"For ever virgin to our sense,"
10063,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Remote they wane to gaze intense:

10066,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Till we conceive their heavens hoar,"

10068,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"And Earth, our blood-warm Earth, a shuddering prey"
10069,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,To that frigidity of brainless ray.
10070,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,
10071,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Yet space is given for breath of thought
10072,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Beyond our bounds when musing: more
10073,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"When to that musing love is brought,"
10074,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,And love is asked of love’s wherefore.
10075,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"’Tis Earth’s, her gift; else have we nought:"
10076,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Her gift, her secret, here our tie."
10077,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,And not with her and yonder sky?
10078,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Bethink you: were it Earth alone
10079,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Breeds love, would not her region be"
10080,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,The sole delight and throne
10081,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Of generous Deity?
10082,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,
10083,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,To deeper than this ball of sight
10084,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Appeal the lustrous people of the night.
10085,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Fronting yon shoreless, sown with fiery sails,"
10086,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"It is our ravenous that quails,"
10087,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Flesh by its craven thirsts and fears distraught.

10090,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"The binder of his sheaves, the sane, the right:"
10091,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Of magnitude to magnitude is wrought,"
10092,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,To feel it large of the great life they hold:
10093,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"In them to come, or vaster intervolved,"
10094,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"The issues known in us, our unsolved solved:"
10095,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"That there with toil Life climbs the self-same Tree,"
10096,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Whose roots enrichment have from ripeness dropped.
10097,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,So may we read and little find them cold:
10098,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Let it but be the lord of Mind to guide
10099,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Our eyes; no branch of Reason’s growing lopped;
10100,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Nor dreaming on a dream; but fortified
10101,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"By day to penetrate black midnight; see,"
10102,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Hear, feel, outside the senses; even that we,"
10103,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"The specks of dust upon a mound of mould,"
10104,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"We who reflect those rays, though low our place,"
10105,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,To them are lastingly allied.
10106,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,
10107,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"So may we read, and little find them cold:"
10108,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Not frosty lamps illumining dead space,"
10109,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Not distant aliens, not senseless Powers."
10110,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,The fire is in them whereof we are born;
10111,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,The music of their motion may be ours.
10112,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Spirit shall deem them beckoning Earth and voiced
10113,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Sisterly to her, in her beams rejoiced."
10114,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Of love, the grand impulsion, we behold"
10115,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,The love that lends her grace
10116,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,Among the starry fold.
10117,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Then at new flood of customary morn,"
10118,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Look at her through her showers,"
10119,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,"Her mists, her streaming gold,"
10120,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,A wonder edges the familiar face:
10121,MEDITATION UNDER STARS,She wears no more that robe of printed hours;

10272,PHAETHON,The wonderful _Attis_ of Catullus is the one classic example.  A few
10273,PHAETHON,lines have been gathered elsewhere.  Lord Tennyson’s _Boadicea_ rides
10274,PHAETHON,over many difficulties and is a noble poem.  Catullus makes general use
10275,PHAETHON,of the variant second of the above metrical forms:
10276,PHAETHON,
10277,PHAETHON,"_Mihi januae frequentes_, _mihi limina tepida_:"
10278,PHAETHON,
10279,PHAETHON,With stress on the emotion;
10280,PHAETHON,
10281,PHAETHON,"_Jam_, _jam dolet quod egi_, _jam jamque poenitet_."
10282,PHAETHON,
10283,PHAETHON,A perfect conquest of the measure is not possible in our tongue.  For the
10284,PHAETHON,"sake of an occasional success in the velocity, sweep, volume of the line,"
10285,PHAETHON,"it seems worth an effort; and, if to some degree serviceable for"
10286,PHAETHON,"narrative verse, it is one of the exercises of a writer which readers may"
10287,PHAETHON,be invited to share.
