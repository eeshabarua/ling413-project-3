733,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,"And that the sufferer said,"

751,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,For her pledged mine.
752,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,
753,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,Then I deigned a deed of hell;

763,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,"The pale face vanished quick,"

767,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,
768,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,"And they prick on, ceaselessly,"
769,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,For that stab in Love’s fierce fashion
770,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,"Which, unfired by lover’s passion,"

772,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,
773,THE FACE AT THE CASEMENT,"She smiled at my caress,"

1936,UNDER THE WATERFALL,And has spoken since hills were turfless peaks.”
1937,UNDER THE WATERFALL,
1938,UNDER THE WATERFALL,“And why gives this the only prime
1939,UNDER THE WATERFALL,Idea to you of a real love-rhyme?
1940,UNDER THE WATERFALL,And why does plunging your arm in a bowl
1941,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"Full of spring water, bring throbs to your soul?”"
1942,UNDER THE WATERFALL,
1943,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"“Well, under the fall, in a crease of the stone,"
1944,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"Though where precisely none ever has known,"

1946,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"And by now with its smoothness opalized,"

1948,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"For, down that pass"
1949,UNDER THE WATERFALL,My lover and I
1950,UNDER THE WATERFALL,Walked under a sky
1951,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"Of blue with a leaf-woven awning of green,"
1952,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"In the burn of August, to paint the scene,"
1953,UNDER THE WATERFALL,And we placed our basket of fruit and wine
1954,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"By the runlet’s rim, where we sat to dine;"
1955,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"And when we had drunk from the glass together,"
1956,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"Arched by the oak-copse from the weather,"
1957,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"I held the vessel to rinse in the fall,"
1958,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"Where it slipped, and sank, and was past recall,"
1959,UNDER THE WATERFALL,Though we stooped and plumbed the little abyss
1960,UNDER THE WATERFALL,With long bared arms.  There the glass still is.
1961,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"And, as said, if I thrust my arm below"
1962,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"Cold water in basin or bowl, a throe"
1963,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"From the past awakens a sense of that time,"
1964,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"And the glass both used, and the cascade’s rhyme."
1965,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"The basin seems the pool, and its edge"
1966,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"The hard smooth face of the brook-side ledge,"
1967,UNDER THE WATERFALL,And the leafy pattern of china-ware
1968,UNDER THE WATERFALL,The hanging plants that were bathing there.
1969,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"By night, by day, when it shines or lours,"
1970,UNDER THE WATERFALL,"There lies intact that chalice of ours,"
1971,UNDER THE WATERFALL,And its presence adds to the rhyme of love
1972,UNDER THE WATERFALL,Persistently sung by the fall above.
1973,UNDER THE WATERFALL,No lip has touched it since his and mine
1974,UNDER THE WATERFALL,In turns therefrom sipped lovers’ wine.”

2095,THE GOING,That your great going
2096,THE GOING,"Had place that moment, and altered all."
2097,THE GOING,
2098,THE GOING,Why do you make me leave the house
2099,THE GOING,And think for a breath it is you I see
2100,THE GOING,At the end of the alley of bending boughs
2101,THE GOING,Where so often at dusk you used to be;
2102,THE GOING,Till in darkening dankness
2103,THE GOING,The yawning blankness

2110,THE GOING,"And, reining nigh me,"
2111,THE GOING,"Would muse and eye me,"
2112,THE GOING,While Life unrolled us its very best.
2113,THE GOING,
2114,THE GOING,"Why, then, latterly did we not speak,"

2117,THE GOING,"That time’s renewal?  We might have said,"

2803,THE WISTFUL LADY,"To my light outdoor words, and pondering each,"
2804,THE WISTFUL LADY,"Her frail white finger swayed in pantomime,"
2805,THE WISTFUL LADY,"As if she fain would close with me in speech,"
2806,THE WISTFUL LADY,And yet would not come near.
2807,THE WISTFUL LADY,
2808,THE WISTFUL LADY,“And once I saw her beckoning with her hand
2809,THE WISTFUL LADY,As I came into sight
2810,THE WISTFUL LADY,At an upper window.  And I at last went out;
2811,THE WISTFUL LADY,"But when I reached where she had seemed to stand,"
2812,THE WISTFUL LADY,"And wandered up and down and searched about,"
2813,THE WISTFUL LADY,I found she had vanished quite.”
2814,THE WISTFUL LADY,
2815,THE WISTFUL LADY,"Then thought I how my dead Love used to say,"
2816,THE WISTFUL LADY,"With a small smile, when she"
2817,THE WISTFUL LADY,"Was waning wan, that she would hover round"
2818,THE WISTFUL LADY,And show herself after her passing day
2819,THE WISTFUL LADY,"To any newer Love I might have found,"
2820,THE WISTFUL LADY,But show her not to me.

2828,THE WOMAN IN THE RYE,"Cold-lipped, unconscious, wet to the knee,"
2829,THE WOMAN IN THE RYE,When there are firesides near?” said I.

2847,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,WHY do you harbour that great cheval-glass
2848,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Filling up your narrow room?
2849,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"You never preen or plume,"
2850,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Or look in a week at your full-length figure—
2851,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Picture of bachelor gloom!
2852,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,
2853,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"“Well, when I dwelt in ancient England,"
2854,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"Renting the valley farm,"
2855,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"Thoughtless of all heart-harm,"
2856,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"I used to gaze at the parson’s daughter,"
2857,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,A creature of nameless charm.
2858,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,
2859,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"“Thither there came a lover and won her,"
2860,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Carried her off from my view.
2861,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,O it was then I knew
2862,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Misery of a cast undreamt of—
2863,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"More than, indeed, my due!"
2864,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,
2865,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,“Then far rumours of her ill-usage
2866,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"Came, like a chilling breath"
2867,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,When a man languisheth;
2868,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"Followed by news that her mind lost balance,"
2869,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"And, in a space, of her death."
2870,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,
2871,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,“Soon sank her father; and next was the auction—
2872,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Everything to be sold:
2873,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Mid things new and old

2875,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"Long in her use, I was told."
2876,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,
2877,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"“Well, I awaited the sale and bought it . . ."
2878,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"There by my bed it stands,"
2879,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,And as the dawn expands
2880,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Often I see her pale-faced form there
2881,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Brushing her hair’s bright bands.
2882,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,
2883,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"“There, too, at pallid midnight moments"
2884,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"Quick she will come to my call,"
2885,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Smile from the frame withal
2886,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,"Ponderingly, as she used to regard me"
2887,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,Passing her father’s wall.

2889,THE CHEVAL-GLASS,“So that it was for its revelations

2902,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Of a wailful wintry nightfall,"
2903,THE RE-ENACTMENT,When the boom
2904,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Of the ocean, like a hammering in a hollow tomb,"
2905,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2906,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Throbbed up the copse-clothed valley

2908,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"To the chamber where I darkled,"
2909,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Sunk and sore
2910,THE RE-ENACTMENT,With gray ponderings why my Loved one had not come before
2911,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2912,THE RE-ENACTMENT,To salute me in the dwelling
2913,THE RE-ENACTMENT,That of late
2914,THE RE-ENACTMENT,I had hired to waste a while in—
2915,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Vague of date,"
2916,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Quaint, and remote—wherein I now expectant sate;"
2917,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2918,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"On the solitude, unsignalled,"
2919,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Broke a man
2920,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Who, in air as if at home there,"
2921,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Seemed to scan
2922,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Every fire-flecked nook of the apartment span by span.
2923,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2924,THE RE-ENACTMENT,A stranger’s and no lover’s
2925,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Eyes were these,"
2926,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Eyes of a man who measures
2927,THE RE-ENACTMENT,What he sees
2928,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"But vaguely, as if wrapt in filmy phantasies."
2929,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2930,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Yea, his bearing was so absent"
2931,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"As he stood,"
2932,THE RE-ENACTMENT,It bespoke a chord so plaintive
2933,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"In his mood,"
2934,THE RE-ENACTMENT,That soon I judged he would not wrong my quietude.
2935,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2936,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"“Ah—the supper is just ready,”"
2937,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Then he said,"
2938,THE RE-ENACTMENT,“And the years’-long binned Madeira
2939,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Flashes red!”
2940,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"(There was no wine, no food, no supper-table spread.)"
2941,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2942,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"“You will forgive my coming,"
2943,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Lady fair?
2944,THE RE-ENACTMENT,I see you as at that time
2945,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Rising there,"
2946,THE RE-ENACTMENT,The self-same curious querying in your eyes and air.
2947,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2948,THE RE-ENACTMENT,“Yet no.  How so?  You wear not
2949,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"The same gown,"
2950,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Your locks show woful difference,"
2951,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Are not brown:
2952,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"What, is it not as when I hither came from town?"
2953,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2954,THE RE-ENACTMENT,“And the place . . . But you seem other—
2955,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Can it be?
2956,THE RE-ENACTMENT,What’s this that Time is doing
2957,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Unto me?
2958,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"_You_ dwell here, unknown woman? . . . Whereabouts, then, is she?"
2959,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2960,THE RE-ENACTMENT,“And the house—things are much shifted.—
2961,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Put them where
2962,THE RE-ENACTMENT,They stood on this night’s fellow;

2964,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Here was the couch: and the piano should be there.”
2965,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2966,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"I indulged him, verily nerve-strained"
2967,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Being alone,"
2968,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"And I moved the things as bidden,"
2969,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"One by one,"
2970,THE RE-ENACTMENT,And feigned to push the old piano where he had shown.
2971,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2972,THE RE-ENACTMENT,“Aha—now I can see her!
2973,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Stand aside:
2974,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Don’t thrust her from the table
2975,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Where, meek-eyed,"
2976,THE RE-ENACTMENT,She makes attempt with matron-manners to preside.
2977,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2978,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"“She serves me: now she rises,"
2979,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Goes to play . . .
2980,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"But you obstruct her, fill her"
2981,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"With dismay,"
2982,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"And embarrassed, scared, she vanishes away!”"
2983,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2984,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"And, as ’twere useless longer"
2985,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"To persist,"
2986,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"He sighed, and sought the entry"
2987,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Ere I wist,"
2988,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"And retreated, disappearing soundless in the mist."
2989,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2990,THE RE-ENACTMENT,That here some mighty passion
2991,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Once had burned,"
2992,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Which still the walls enghosted,"
2993,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"I discerned,"
2994,THE RE-ENACTMENT,And that by its strong spell mine might be overturned.
2995,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
2996,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"I sat depressed; till, later,"
2997,THE RE-ENACTMENT,My Love came;
2998,THE RE-ENACTMENT,But something in the chamber
2999,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Dimmed our flame,—"
3000,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"An emanation, making our due words fall tame,"
3001,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
3002,THE RE-ENACTMENT,As if the intenser drama
3003,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Shown me there
3004,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Of what the walls had witnessed
3005,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Filled the air,"
3006,THE RE-ENACTMENT,And left no room for later passion anywhere.
3007,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
3008,THE RE-ENACTMENT,So came it that our fervours
3009,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Did quite fail
3010,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Of future consummation—
3011,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Being made quail
3012,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"By the weird witchery of the parlour’s hidden tale,"
3013,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
3014,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Which I, as years passed, faintly"
3015,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Learnt to trace,—"
3016,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"One of sad love, born full-winged"
3017,THE RE-ENACTMENT,In that place
3018,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Where the predestined sorrowers first stood face to face.
3019,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
3020,THE RE-ENACTMENT,And as that month of winter
3021,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Circles round,"
3022,THE RE-ENACTMENT,And the evening of the date-day
3023,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"Grows embrowned,"
3024,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"I am conscious of those presences, and sit spellbound."
3025,THE RE-ENACTMENT,
3026,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"There, often—lone, forsaken—"
3027,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Queries breed
3028,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Within me; whether a phantom
3029,THE RE-ENACTMENT,Had my heed
3030,THE RE-ENACTMENT,"On that strange night, or was it some wrecked heart indeed?"

3041,HER SECRET,
3042,HER SECRET,"He searched for the trace of a pictured face,"
3043,HER SECRET,"He watched each missive come,"
3044,HER SECRET,And a note that seemed like a love-line
3045,HER SECRET,Made him look frozen and glum.
3046,HER SECRET,
3047,HER SECRET,"He dogged my feet to the city street,"
3048,HER SECRET,"He followed me to the sea,"
3049,HER SECRET,But not to the neighbouring churchyard
3050,HER SECRET,Did he dream of following me.

3060,“SHE CHARGED ME”,
3061,“SHE CHARGED ME”,Sat on a night when the endless pour
3062,“SHE CHARGED ME”,Of rain on the roof and the road below
3063,“SHE CHARGED ME”,Bent the spring of the spirit more and more . . .
3064,“SHE CHARGED ME”,
3065,“SHE CHARGED ME”,—So charged she me; and the Cupid’s bow
3066,“SHE CHARGED ME”,"Of her mouth was hard, and her eyes, and her face,"
3067,“SHE CHARGED ME”,And her white forefinger lifted slow.
3068,“SHE CHARGED ME”,
3069,“SHE CHARGED ME”,"Had she done it gently, or shown a trace"

3071,“SHE CHARGED ME”,"A folly passed ere her reign had place,"
3072,“SHE CHARGED ME”,
3073,“SHE CHARGED ME”,A kiss might have ended it.  But I knew
3074,“SHE CHARGED ME”,"From the fall of each word, and the pause between,"
3075,“SHE CHARGED ME”,That the curtain would drop upon us two
3076,“SHE CHARGED ME”,"Ere long, in our play of slave and queen."

3085,THE NEWCOMER’S WIFE,For the name had reached him through the door
3086,THE NEWCOMER’S WIFE,Of her he had married the week before.

3088,THE NEWCOMER’S WIFE,“We called her the Hack of the Parade;

3102,THE NEWCOMER’S WIFE,
3103,THE NEWCOMER’S WIFE,That night there was the splash of a fall

3116,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,As the dawn drew in on their faces there.
3117,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3118,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,The chamber looked far over the sea
3119,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"From a white hotel on a white-stoned quay,"
3120,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And stepping a stride
3121,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,He parted the window-drapery.
3122,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3123,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Above the level horizon spread
3124,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"The sunrise, firing them foot to head"
3125,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"From its smouldering lair,"
3126,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And painting their pillows with dyes of red.
3127,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3128,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“What strange disquiets have stirred you, dear,"
3129,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"This dragging night, with starts in fear"
3130,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Of me, as it were,"
3131,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Or of something evil hovering near?”
3132,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3133,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“My husband, can I have fear of you?"
3134,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"What should one fear from a man whom few,"
3135,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Or none, had matched"
3136,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,In that late long spell of delays undue!”
3137,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3138,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,He watched her eyes in the heaving sun:
3139,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“Then what has kept, O reticent one,"
3140,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Those lids unlatched—
3141,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Anything promised I’ve not yet done?”
3142,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3143,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“O it’s not a broken promise of yours
3144,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,(For what quite lightly your lip assures

3157,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3158,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“But you flung my arms away from your side,"

3160,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Ere the tour be out
3161,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,In an air so loth can be justified?
3162,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3163,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“Ah—had you a male friend once loved well,"
3164,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Upon whose suit disaster fell

3166,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Honest you are, and may care to tell.”"
3167,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3168,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"She lay impassive, and nothing broke"
3169,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"The stillness other than, stroke by stroke,"
3170,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,The lazy lift
3171,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Of the tide below them; till she spoke:
3172,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3173,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“I once had a friend—a Love, if you will—"

3178,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“He remained alone; and we met—to love,"
3179,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,But barring legitimate joy thereof
3180,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Stood a doorless wall,"
3181,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Though we prized each other all else above.
3182,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3183,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“And this was why, though I’d touched my prime,"
3184,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,I put off suitors from time to time—
3185,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Yourself with the rest—
3186,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Till friends, who approved you, called it crime,"

3188,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“And when misgivings weighed on me

3197,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,

3199,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"The loungers talked, and I could but lend"
3200,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"A listening ear,"
3201,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,For they named the dead.  ’Twas the wife of my friend.
3202,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3203,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“He was there, but did not note me, veiled,"
3204,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Yet I saw that a joy, as of one unjailed,"

3206,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,He knew not his hope of me just had failed!
3207,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3208,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“They had brought her home: she was born in this isle;
3209,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"And he will return to his domicile,"
3210,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And pass his days
3211,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Alone, and not as he dreamt erstwhile!”"
3212,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3213,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“—So you’ve lost a sprucer spouse than I!”
3214,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"She held her peace, as if fain deny"
3215,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,She would indeed
3216,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"For his pleasure’s sake, but could lip no lie."
3217,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3218,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“One far less formal and plain and slow!”
3219,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,She let the laconic assertion go
3220,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,As if of need
3221,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,She held the conviction that it was so.
3222,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3223,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“Regard me as his he always should,"
3224,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"He had said, and wed me he vowed he would"

3226,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Most verily do, if ever he could."
3227,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3228,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“And this fulfilment is now his aim,"
3229,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"For a letter, addressed in my maiden name,"
3230,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Has dogged me here,"
3231,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Reminding me faithfully of his claim.
3232,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3233,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“And it started a hope like a lightning-streak
3234,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,That I might go to him—say for a week—
3235,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And afford you right

3237,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3238,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“To be sure you have said, as of dim intent,"
3239,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,That marriage is a plain event

3241,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Without any ghost of sentiment,"
3242,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3243,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“And my heart has quailed.—But deny it true
3244,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,That you will never this lock undo!
3245,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,No God intends
3246,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,To thwart the yearning He’s father to!”
3247,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3248,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"The husband hemmed, then blandly bowed"
3249,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,In the light of the angry morning cloud.
3250,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“So my idyll ends,"
3251,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And a drama opens!” he mused aloud;
3252,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3253,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And his features froze.  “You may take it as true
3254,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,That I will never this lock undo
3255,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,For so depraved
3256,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,A passion as that which kindles you.”
3257,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3258,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Said she: “I am sorry you see it so;
3259,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"I had hoped you might have let me go,"
3260,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And thus been saved
3261,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,The pain of learning there’s more to know.”
3262,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3263,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“More?  What may that be?  Gad, I think"
3264,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,You have told me enough to make me blink!
3265,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Yet if more remain
3266,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Then own it to me.  I will not shrink!”
3267,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3268,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“Well, it is this.  As we could not see"
3269,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"That a legal marriage could ever be,"
3270,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,To end our pain
3271,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,We united ourselves informally;
3272,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3273,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“And vowed at a chancel-altar nigh,"
3274,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"With book and ring, a lifelong tie;"
3275,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,A contract vain
3276,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"To the world, but real to Him on High.”"
3277,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3278,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“And you became as his wife?”—“I did.”—
3279,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"He stood as stiff as a caryatid,"
3280,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"And said, “Indeed! . . ."
3281,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"No matter.  You’re mine, whatever you ye hid!”"
3282,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3283,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“But is it right!  When I only gave
3284,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"My hand to you in a sweat to save,"
3285,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Through desperate need
3286,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"(As I thought), my fame, for I was not brave!”"
3287,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3288,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“To save your fame?  Your meaning is dim,"
3289,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,For nobody knew of your altar-whim?”
3290,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“I mean—I feared
3291,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,There might be fruit of my tie with him;
3292,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3293,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“And to cloak it by marriage I’m not the first,"
3294,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Though, maybe, morally most accurst"
3295,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Through your unpeered
3296,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And strict uprightness.  That’s the worst!
3297,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3298,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“While yesterday his worn contours
3299,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Convinced me that love like his endures,"
3300,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And that my troth-plight
3301,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Had been his, in fact, and not truly yours.”"
3302,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3303,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“So, my lady, you raise the veil by degrees . . ."
3304,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,I own this last is enough to freeze
3305,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,The warmest wight!
3306,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Now hear the other side, if you please:"
3307,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3308,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“I did say once, though without intent,"
3309,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,That marriage is a plain event
3310,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"Of black and white,"
3311,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Whatever may be its sentiment.
3312,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3313,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“I’ll act accordingly, none the less"
3314,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"That you soiled the contract in time of stress,"
3315,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Thereto induced
3316,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,By the feared results of your wantonness.
3317,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3318,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“But the thing is over, and no one knows,"
3319,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And it’s nought to the future what you disclose.
3320,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,That you’ll be loosed
3321,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"For such an episode, don’t suppose!"
3322,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3323,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“No: I’ll not free you.  And if it appear
3324,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,There was too good ground for your first fear
3325,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"From your amorous tricks,"
3326,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"I’ll father the child.  Yes, by God, my dear."
3327,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,

3331,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And whip you home.  That’s the sort I am!”
3332,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3333,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,She whitened. “Enough . . . Since you disapprove
3334,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"I’ll yield in silence, and never move"
3335,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,Till my last pulse ticks
3336,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,A footstep from the domestic groove.”
3337,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3338,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“Then swear it,” he said, “and your king uncrown.”"
3339,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"He drew her forth in her long white gown,"
3340,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,And she knelt and swore.
3341,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,“Good.  Now you may go and again lie down
3342,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3343,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"“Since you’ve played these pranks and given no sign,"
3344,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,You shall crave this man of yours; pine and pine
3345,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"With sighings sore,"
3346,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,’Till I’ve starved your love for him; nailed you mine.

3352,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,
3353,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"She answered not, but lay listlessly"
3354,A CONVERSATION AT DAWN,"With her dark dry eyes on the coppery sea,"

3953,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"And, stirred by hauntings, he must needs repair"
3954,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"To where the tomb was.  Lo, it stood still wasting"
3955,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,In no man’s care.
3956,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
3957,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,“The travelled man you met
3958,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"The last time,” said the sexton, “has not yet"
3959,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"Appeared again, though wealth he had in plenty."
3960,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,—Can he forget?
3961,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
3962,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,“The architect was hired
3963,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"And came here on smart summons as desired,"
3964,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,But never the descendant came to tell him
3965,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,What he required.”
3966,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
3967,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,And so the tomb remained
3968,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"Untouched, untended, crumbling, weather-stained,"
3969,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,And though the one-time foe was fain to right it
3970,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,He still refrained.
3971,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
3972,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,“I’ll set about it when
3973,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,I am sure he’ll come no more.  Best wait till then.”
3974,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,But so it was that never the stranger entered
3975,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,That city again.
3976,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
3977,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,And the well-meaner died
3978,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,While waiting tremulously unsatisfied
3979,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,That no return of the family’s foreign scion
3980,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,Would still betide.
3981,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
3982,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"And many years slid by,"
3983,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,And active church-restorers cast their eye
3984,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,Upon the ancient garth and hoary building
3985,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,The tomb stood nigh.
3986,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
3987,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"And when they had scraped each wall,"
3988,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"Pulled out the stately pews, and smartened all,"
3989,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"“It will be well,” declared the spruce church-warden,"
3990,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,“To overhaul
3991,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
3992,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,“And broaden this path where shown;
3993,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,Nothing prevents it but an old tombstone
3994,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"Pertaining to a family forgotten,"
3995,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,Of deeds unknown.
3996,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
3997,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"“Their names can scarce be read,"
3998,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"Depend on’t, all who care for them are dead.”"
3999,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"So went the tomb, whose shards were as path-paving"
4000,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,Distributed.
4001,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
4002,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,Over it and about
4003,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"Men’s footsteps beat, and wind and water-spout,"
4004,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"Until the names, aforetime gnawed by weathers,"
4005,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,Were quite worn out.
4006,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,
4007,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,So that no sage can say
4008,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,"In pensive progress near where they decay,"
4009,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,“This stone records a luminous line whose talents
4010,THE OBLITERATE TOMB,Told in their day.”

4364,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,And plunged into the wood untraced . . .
4365,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,When separately therefrom they paced
4366,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,The sun had quite gone down.
4367,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,
4368,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,"The hat and feather disappeared,"
4369,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,"The dowdy hood again was donned,"
4370,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,And in the gloom the fair one neared
4371,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,"Her home and husband dour, who conned"
4372,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,Calmly his blue-eyed blonde.
4373,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,
4374,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,"“To-day,” he said, “you have shown good sense,"
4375,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,A dress so modest and so meek
4376,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,Should always deck your goings hence
4377,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,Alone.”  And as a recompense
4378,IN THE DAYS OF CRINOLINE,He kissed her on the cheek.

4394,THE ROMAN GRAVEMOUNDS,
4395,THE ROMAN GRAVEMOUNDS,"But no; in his basket, see, he has brought"

4607,PART II,"Down in the crowd where I, to see"

4609,PART II,With a set face he lipped to me—
4610,PART II,“Remember.”  “Ay!” I cried.
4611,PART II,
4612,PART II,By night and day I shadowed her
4613,PART II,"From Toneborough Deane to Dunkery Tor,"
4614,PART II,"I shadowed her asleep, astir,"
4615,PART II,And yet I could not bear—
4616,PART II,Till Wrestler Joe anon began
4617,PART II,"To figure as her chosen man,"
4618,PART II,And took her to his shining van—
4619,PART II,To doom a form so fair!
4620,PART II,
4621,PART II,He made it handsome for her sake—
4622,PART II,And Dunkery smiled to Exon Moor—
4623,PART II,"He made it handsome for her sake,"
4624,PART II,Painting it out and in;
4625,PART II,And on the door of apple-green
4626,PART II,"A bright brass knocker soon was seen,"
4627,PART II,And window-curtains white and clean
4628,PART II,For her to sit within.
4629,PART II,
4630,PART II,And all could see she clave to him
4631,PART II,"As cleaves a cloud to Dunkery Tor,"
4632,PART II,"Yea, all could see she clave to him,"
4633,PART II,"And every day I said,"
4634,PART II,“A pity it seems to part those two
4635,PART II,That hourly grow to love more true:
4636,PART II,Yet she’s the wanton woman who
4637,PART II,Sent one to swing till dead!”
4638,PART II,
4639,PART II,"That blew to blazing all my hate,"

4646,PART II,"Your goodman’s, can they be?”"
4647,PART II,
4648,PART II,"She paled, and went, I close behind—"
4649,PART II,"And Exon frowned to Dunkery Tor,"
4650,PART II,"She went, and I came up behind"
4651,PART II,And tipped the plank that bore
4652,PART II,"Her, fleetly flitting across to eye"
4653,PART II,What such might bode.  She slid awry;
4654,PART II,"And from the current came a cry,"
4655,PART II,A gurgle; and no more.
4656,PART II,
4657,PART II,How that befell no mortal knew

4659,PART II,No mortal knew that deed undue
4660,PART II,"But he who schemed the crime,"
4661,PART II,Which night still covers . . . But in dream
4662,PART II,Those ropes of hair upon the stream

4795,THE ABBEY MASON,"Onward to Prime the abbot went,"
4796,THE ABBEY MASON,Tacit upon the incident.
4797,THE ABBEY MASON,
4798,THE ABBEY MASON,—Men now discerned as days revolved
4799,THE ABBEY MASON,The ogive riddle had been solved;
4800,THE ABBEY MASON,
4801,THE ABBEY MASON,"Templates were cut, fresh lines were chalked"
4802,THE ABBEY MASON,"Where lines had been defaced and balked,"
4803,THE ABBEY MASON,
4804,THE ABBEY MASON,"And the work swelled and mounted higher,"
4805,THE ABBEY MASON,Achievement distancing desire;
4806,THE ABBEY MASON,
4807,THE ABBEY MASON,"Here jambs with transoms fixed between,"
4808,THE ABBEY MASON,Where never the like before had been—
4809,THE ABBEY MASON,
4810,THE ABBEY MASON,There little mullions thinly sawn
4811,THE ABBEY MASON,Where meeting circles once were drawn.
4812,THE ABBEY MASON,
4813,THE ABBEY MASON,"“We knew,” men said, “the thing would go"
4814,THE ABBEY MASON,"After his craft-wit got aglow,"
4815,THE ABBEY MASON,
4816,THE ABBEY MASON,"“And, once fulfilled what he has designed,"
4817,THE ABBEY MASON,We’ll honour him and his great mind!”
4818,THE ABBEY MASON,
4819,THE ABBEY MASON,"When matters stood thus poised awhile,"
4820,THE ABBEY MASON,"And all surroundings shed a smile,"
4821,THE ABBEY MASON,
4822,THE ABBEY MASON,The master-mason on an eve
4823,THE ABBEY MASON,Homed to his wife and seemed to grieve . . .
4824,THE ABBEY MASON,
4825,THE ABBEY MASON,—“The abbot spoke to me to-day:
4826,THE ABBEY MASON,He hangs about the works alway.
4827,THE ABBEY MASON,
4828,THE ABBEY MASON,“He knows the source as well as I
4829,THE ABBEY MASON,Of the new style men magnify.
4830,THE ABBEY MASON,
4831,THE ABBEY MASON,“He said: ‘You pride yourself too much
4832,THE ABBEY MASON,On your creation.  Is it such?
4833,THE ABBEY MASON,
4834,THE ABBEY MASON,“‘Surely the hand of God it is
4835,THE ABBEY MASON,"That conjured so, and only His!—"
4836,THE ABBEY MASON,
4837,THE ABBEY MASON,“‘Disclosing by the frost and rain
4838,THE ABBEY MASON,Forms your invention chased in vain;
4839,THE ABBEY MASON,
4840,THE ABBEY MASON,“‘Hence the devices deemed so great
4841,THE ABBEY MASON,"You copied, and did not create.’"
4842,THE ABBEY MASON,
4843,THE ABBEY MASON,"“I feel the abbot’s words are just,"
4844,THE ABBEY MASON,And that all thanks renounce I must.
4845,THE ABBEY MASON,
4846,THE ABBEY MASON,“Can a man welcome praise and pelf
4847,THE ABBEY MASON,For hatching art that hatched itself? . . .
4848,THE ABBEY MASON,
4849,THE ABBEY MASON,"“So, I shall own the deft design"
4850,THE ABBEY MASON,"Is Heaven’s outshaping, and not mine.”"
4851,THE ABBEY MASON,
4852,THE ABBEY MASON,“What!” said she.  “Praise your works ensure
4853,THE ABBEY MASON,"To throw away, and quite obscure"
4854,THE ABBEY MASON,
4855,THE ABBEY MASON,“Your beaming and beneficent star?
4856,THE ABBEY MASON,Better you leave things as they are!
4857,THE ABBEY MASON,
4858,THE ABBEY MASON,"“Why, think awhile.  Had not your zest"
4859,THE ABBEY MASON,In your loved craft curtailed your rest—
4860,THE ABBEY MASON,
4861,THE ABBEY MASON,“Had you not gone there ere the day
4862,THE ABBEY MASON,The sun had melted all away!”
4863,THE ABBEY MASON,
4864,THE ABBEY MASON,"—But, though his good wife argued so,"
4865,THE ABBEY MASON,The mason let the people know
4866,THE ABBEY MASON,
4867,THE ABBEY MASON,That not unaided sprang the thought
4868,THE ABBEY MASON,"Whereby the glorious fane was wrought,"
4869,THE ABBEY MASON,
4870,THE ABBEY MASON,But that by frost when dawn was dim
4871,THE ABBEY MASON,The method was disclosed to him.
4872,THE ABBEY MASON,
4873,THE ABBEY MASON,"“Yet,” said the townspeople thereat,"
4874,THE ABBEY MASON,"“’Tis your own doing, even with that!”"
4875,THE ABBEY MASON,
4876,THE ABBEY MASON,"But he—chafed, childlike, in extremes—"
4877,THE ABBEY MASON,The temperament of men of dreams—
4878,THE ABBEY MASON,
4879,THE ABBEY MASON,Aloofly scrupled to admit
4880,THE ABBEY MASON,"That he did aught but borrow it,"
4881,THE ABBEY MASON,
4882,THE ABBEY MASON,And diffidently made request
4883,THE ABBEY MASON,That with the abbot all should rest.
4884,THE ABBEY MASON,
4885,THE ABBEY MASON,"—As none could doubt the abbot’s word,"
4886,THE ABBEY MASON,"Or question what the church averred,"
4887,THE ABBEY MASON,
4888,THE ABBEY MASON,The mason was at length believed
4889,THE ABBEY MASON,"Of no more count than he conceived,"
4890,THE ABBEY MASON,
4891,THE ABBEY MASON,And soon began to lose the fame
4892,THE ABBEY MASON,That late had gathered round his name . . .
4893,THE ABBEY MASON,
4894,THE ABBEY MASON,"—Time passed, and like a living thing"
4895,THE ABBEY MASON,"The pile went on embodying,"
4896,THE ABBEY MASON,
4897,THE ABBEY MASON,"And workmen died, and young ones grew,"
4898,THE ABBEY MASON,And the old mason sank from view
4899,THE ABBEY MASON,
4900,THE ABBEY MASON,And Abbots Wygmore and Staunton went
4901,THE ABBEY MASON,And Horton sped the embellishment.
4902,THE ABBEY MASON,
4903,THE ABBEY MASON,But not till years had far progressed
4904,THE ABBEY MASON,"Chanced it that, one day, much impressed,"
4905,THE ABBEY MASON,
4906,THE ABBEY MASON,"Standing within the well-graced aisle,"
4907,THE ABBEY MASON,He asked who first conceived the style;
4908,THE ABBEY MASON,
4909,THE ABBEY MASON,And some decrepit sage detailed
4910,THE ABBEY MASON,"How, when invention nought availed,"
4911,THE ABBEY MASON,
4912,THE ABBEY MASON,The cloud-cast waters in their whim
4913,THE ABBEY MASON,"Came down, and gave the hint to him"
4914,THE ABBEY MASON,
4915,THE ABBEY MASON,"Who struck each arc, and made each mould;"
4916,THE ABBEY MASON,And how the abbot would not hold
4917,THE ABBEY MASON,
4918,THE ABBEY MASON,As sole begetter him who applied
4919,THE ABBEY MASON,Forms the Almighty sent as guide;
4920,THE ABBEY MASON,
4921,THE ABBEY MASON,"And how the master lost renown,"
4922,THE ABBEY MASON,And wore in death no artist’s crown.
4923,THE ABBEY MASON,
4924,THE ABBEY MASON,"—Then Horton, who in inner thought"
4925,THE ABBEY MASON,"Had more perceptions than he taught,"
4926,THE ABBEY MASON,
4927,THE ABBEY MASON,Replied: “Nay; art can but transmute;
4928,THE ABBEY MASON,Invention is not absolute;
4929,THE ABBEY MASON,
4930,THE ABBEY MASON,"“Things fail to spring from nought at call,"
4931,THE ABBEY MASON,And art-beginnings most of all.
4932,THE ABBEY MASON,
4933,THE ABBEY MASON,"“He did but what all artists do,"
4934,THE ABBEY MASON,Wait upon Nature for his cue.”
4935,THE ABBEY MASON,
4936,THE ABBEY MASON,—“Had you been here to tell them so
4937,THE ABBEY MASON,"Lord Abbot, sixty years ago,"
4938,THE ABBEY MASON,
4939,THE ABBEY MASON,"“The mason, now long underground,"
4940,THE ABBEY MASON,Doubtless a different fate had found.
4941,THE ABBEY MASON,
4942,THE ABBEY MASON,"“He passed into oblivion dim,"
4943,THE ABBEY MASON,And none knew what became of him!
4944,THE ABBEY MASON,
4945,THE ABBEY MASON,“His name?  ’Twas of some common kind
4946,THE ABBEY MASON,And now has faded out of mind.”
4947,THE ABBEY MASON,
4948,THE ABBEY MASON,The Abbot: “It shall not be hid!
4949,THE ABBEY MASON,I’ll trace it.” . . . But he never did.
4950,THE ABBEY MASON,
4951,THE ABBEY MASON,—When longer yet dank death had wormed
4952,THE ABBEY MASON,The brain wherein the style had germed
4953,THE ABBEY MASON,
4954,THE ABBEY MASON,From Gloucester church it flew afar—
4955,THE ABBEY MASON,The style called Perpendicular.—
4956,THE ABBEY MASON,
4957,THE ABBEY MASON,To Winton and to Westminster
4958,THE ABBEY MASON,"It ranged, and grew still beautifuller:"
4959,THE ABBEY MASON,
4960,THE ABBEY MASON,From Solway Frith to Dover Strand
4961,THE ABBEY MASON,"Its fascinations starred the land,"
4962,THE ABBEY MASON,
4963,THE ABBEY MASON,Not only on cathedral walls
4964,THE ABBEY MASON,"But upon courts and castle halls,"
4965,THE ABBEY MASON,
4966,THE ABBEY MASON,Till every edifice in the isle
4967,THE ABBEY MASON,"Was patterned to no other style,"
4968,THE ABBEY MASON,
4969,THE ABBEY MASON,"And till, long having played its part,"
4970,THE ABBEY MASON,The curtain fell on Gothic art.
4971,THE ABBEY MASON,
4972,THE ABBEY MASON,"—Well: when in Wessex on your rounds,"
4973,THE ABBEY MASON,"Take a brief step beyond its bounds,"
4974,THE ABBEY MASON,
4975,THE ABBEY MASON,And enter Gloucester: seek the quoin
4976,THE ABBEY MASON,"Where choir and transept interjoin,"
4977,THE ABBEY MASON,
4978,THE ABBEY MASON,"And, gazing at the forms there flung"
4979,THE ABBEY MASON,Against the sky by one unsung—
4980,THE ABBEY MASON,
4981,THE ABBEY MASON,"The ogee arches transom-topped,"
4982,THE ABBEY MASON,"The tracery-stalks by spandrels stopped,"
4983,THE ABBEY MASON,
4984,THE ABBEY MASON,Petrified lacework—lightly lined
4985,THE ABBEY MASON,On ancient massiveness behind—
4986,THE ABBEY MASON,
4987,THE ABBEY MASON,Muse that some minds so modest be
4988,THE ABBEY MASON,"As to renounce fame’s fairest fee,"
4989,THE ABBEY MASON,
4990,THE ABBEY MASON,(Like him who crystallized on this spot
4991,THE ABBEY MASON,"His visionings, but lies forgot,"
4992,THE ABBEY MASON,
4993,THE ABBEY MASON,And many a mediaeval one
4994,THE ABBEY MASON,Whose symmetries salute the sun)
4995,THE ABBEY MASON,
4996,THE ABBEY MASON,"While others boom a baseless claim,"
4997,THE ABBEY MASON,And upon nothing rear a name.
