116,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"Heaven gave Rob Roy a dauntless heart,"

121,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,Yet was Rob Roy as _wise_ as brave;
122,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,Forgive me if the phrase be strong;--
123,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,Poet worthy of Rob Roy
124,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,Must scorn a timid song.

126,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"Say, then, that he was wise as brave;"
127,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,As wise in thought as bold in deed:
128,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,For in the principles of things

166,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"""All Kinds, and Creatures, stand and fall"
167,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,By strength of prowess or of wit:                        50
168,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"Tis God's appointment who must sway,"
169,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"And who is to submit."""
170,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,
171,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"""Since then,"" said Robin, ""right is plain,"
172,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,And longest life is but a day;

176,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"And thus among these rocks he liv'd,"
177,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,Through summer's heat and winter's snow:
178,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"The Eagle, he was Lord above,"
179,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,And Rob was Lord below.                                 60
180,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,
181,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"So was it--_would_, at least, have been"
182,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,But through untowardness of fate:
183,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,For Polity was then too strong;
184,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"He came an age too late,"
185,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,
186,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,Or shall we say an age too soon?

195,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,
196,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"Rob Roy had never linger'd here,"
197,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,To these few meagre Vales confin'd;
198,POEMS _WRITTEN DURING A TOUR_ IN SCOTLAND.,"But thought how wide the world, the times"

2847,NOTE V.,"person who after the battle of Wakefield slew, in the pursuit, the"
2848,NOTE V.,"young Earl of Rutland, Son of the Duke of York who had fallen in the"
2849,NOTE V.,"battle, ""in part of revenge"" (say the Authors of the History of"

2851,NOTE V.,"A deed which worthily blemished the author (saith Speed); But who, as"

2853,NOTE V.,"martial fury? chiefly, when it was resolved not to leave any branch"
2854,NOTE V.,"of the York line standing; for so one maketh this Lord to speak."""
2855,NOTE V.,"This, no doubt, I would observe by the bye, was an action"
2856,NOTE V.,"sufficiently in the vindictive spirit of the times, and yet not"
2857,NOTE V.,"altogether so bad as represented; for the Earl was no child, as"
2858,NOTE V.,"some writers would have him, but able to bear arms, being sixteen or"
2859,NOTE V.,"seventeen years of age, as is evident from this (say the Memoirs of"
2860,NOTE V.,"the Countess of Pembroke, who was laudably anxious to wipe away, as"
2861,NOTE V.,"far as could be, this stigma from the illustrious name to which she"
2862,NOTE V.,"was born); that he was the next Child to King Edward the Fourth,"
2863,NOTE V.,"which his mother had by Richard Duke of York, and that King was then"
2864,NOTE V.,eighteen years of age: and for the small distance betwixt her
2865,NOTE V.,"Children, see Austin Vincent in his book of Nobility, page 622,"
2866,NOTE V.,"where he writes of them all. It may further be observed, that Lord"
2867,NOTE V.,"Clifford, who was then himself only twenty-five years of age, had"
2868,NOTE V.,"been a leading Man and Commander, two or three years together in the"
2869,NOTE V.,"Army of Lancaster, before this time; and, therefore, would be less"
2870,NOTE V.,likely to think that the Earl of Rutland might be entitled to mercy
2871,NOTE V.,"from his youth.--But, independent of this act, at best a cruel and"
2872,NOTE V.,"savage one, the Family of Clifford had done enough to draw upon them"
2873,NOTE V.,the vehement hatred of the House of York: so that after the Battle
2874,NOTE V.,of Towton there was no hope for them but in flight and concealment.
2875,NOTE V.,"Henry, the subject of the Poem, was deprived of his estate and"
2876,NOTE V.,honours during the space of twenty-four years; all which time he
2877,NOTE V.,"lived as a shepherd in Yorkshire, or in Cumberland, where the estate"
2878,NOTE V.,of his Father-in-law (Sir Lancelot Threlkeld) lay. He was restored
2879,NOTE V.,to his estate and honours in the first year of Henry the Seventh. It
2880,NOTE V.,"is recorded that, ""when called to parliament, he behaved nobly and"
2881,NOTE V.,wisely; but otherwise came seldom to London or the Court; and rather
2882,NOTE V.,"delighted to live in the country, where he repaired several of his"
2883,NOTE V.,"Castles, which had gone to decay during the late troubles."" Thus far"
2884,NOTE V.,"is chiefly collected from Nicholson and Burn; and I can add, from my"
2885,NOTE V.,"own knowledge, that there is a tradition current in the village of"
2886,NOTE V.,"Threlkeld and its neighbourhood, his principal retreat, that, in the"
2887,NOTE V.,"course of his shepherd life, he had acquired great astronomical"
2888,NOTE V.,knowledge. I cannot conclude this note without adding a word upon
2889,NOTE V.,"the subject of those numerous and noble feudal Edifices, spoken of"
2890,NOTE V.,"in the Poem, the ruins of some of which are, at this day, so great an"
2891,NOTE V.,ornament to that interesting country. The Cliffords had always been
2892,NOTE V.,distinguished for an honorable pride in these Castles; and we have
2893,NOTE V.,seen that after the wars of York and Lancaster they were rebuilt; in
2894,NOTE V.,"the civil Wars of Charles the First, they were again laid waste, and"
2895,NOTE V.,again restored almost to their former magnificence by the celebrated
2896,NOTE V.,"Lady Anne Clifford, Countess of Pembroke, &c. &c. Not more than 25"
2897,NOTE V.,"years after this was done, when the Estates of Clifford had passed"
2898,NOTE V.,"into the family of Tufton, three of these Castles, namely Brough,"
2899,NOTE V.,"Brougham, and Pendragon, were demolished, and the timber and other"
2900,NOTE V.,"materials sold by Thomas Earl of Thanet. We will hope that, when"
2901,NOTE V.,"this order was issued, the Earl had not consulted the text of Isaiah,"
2902,NOTE V.,"58th Chap. 12th Verse, to which the inscription placed over the"
2903,NOTE V.,"gate of Pendragon Castle, by the Countess of Pembroke (I believe his"
2904,NOTE V.,"Grandmother) at the time she repaired that structure, refers the"
2905,NOTE V.,"reader. ""_And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste"
2906,NOTE V.,"places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and"
2907,NOTE V.,"thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach_, _the restorer of"
2908,NOTE V.,"paths to dwell in_."" The Earl of Thanet, the present possessor of"
2909,NOTE V.,"the Estates, with a due respect for the memory of his ancestors, and"
2910,NOTE V.,"a proper sense of the value and beauty of these remains of antiquity,"
2911,NOTE V.,has (I am told) given orders that they shall be preserved from all
2912,NOTE V.,depredations.
