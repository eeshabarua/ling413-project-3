82,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"_Before a midnight breaks in storm,"
83,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Or herded sea in wrath,"
84,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Ye know what wavering gusts inform
85,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,The greater tempest’s path;
86,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Till the loosed wind
87,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Drive all from mind,"
88,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Except Distress, which, so will prophets cry,"
89,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"O’ercame them, houseless, from the unhinting sky._"
90,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,
91,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,_Ere rivers league against the land
92,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"In piratry of flood,"
93,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Ye know what waters slip and stand
94,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Where seldom water stood.
95,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Yet who will note,"
96,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Till fields afloat,"
97,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"And washen carcass and the returning well,"
98,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Trumpet what these poor heralds strove to tell?_
99,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,
100,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,_Ye know who use the Crystal Ball
101,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"(To peer by stealth on Doom),"
102,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"The Shade that, shaping first of all,"
103,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Prepares an empty room.
104,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Then doth It pass
105,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Like breath from glass,"
106,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"But, on the extorted vision bowed intent,"
107,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,No man considers why It came or went._
108,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,
109,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,_Before the years reborn behold
110,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Themselves with stranger eye,"
111,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"And the sport-making Gods of old,"
112,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Like Samson slaying, die,"
113,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Many shall hear
114,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"The all-pregnant sphere,"
115,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Bow to the birth and sweat, but--speech denied--"
116,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Sit dumb or--dealt in part--fall weak and wide._
117,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,
118,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,_Yet instant to fore-shadowed need
119,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,The eternal balance swings;
120,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,That wingèd men the Fates may breed
121,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,So soon as Fate hath wings.
122,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,These shall possess
123,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,"Our littleness,"
124,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,And in the imperial task (as worthy) lay
125,36 ESSEX STREET W.C.,Up our lives’ all to piece one giant day._

281,PAGE,Stark calm on the lap of the Line or the crazy-eyed hurricane
282,PAGE,blowing--

311,PAGE,

328,PAGE,
329,PAGE,
330,PAGE,They christened my brother of old--
331,PAGE,And a saintly name he bears--
332,PAGE,They gave him his place to hold
333,PAGE,"At the head of the belfry-stairs,"
334,PAGE,Where the minster-towers stand
335,PAGE,And the breeding kestrels cry.
336,PAGE,Would I change with my brother a league inland?
337,PAGE,(_Shoal! ’Ware shoal!_) Not I!
338,PAGE,
339,PAGE,"In the flush of the hot June prime,"
340,PAGE,"O’er smooth flood-tides afire,"
341,PAGE,I hear him hurry the chime
342,PAGE,To the bidding of checked Desire;
343,PAGE,Till the sweated ringers tire
344,PAGE,And the wild bob-majors die.
345,PAGE,Could I wait for my turn in the godly choir?
346,PAGE,(_Shoal! ’Ware shoal!_) Not I!
347,PAGE,
348,PAGE,"When the smoking scud is blown,"
349,PAGE,"When the greasy wind-rack lowers,"
350,PAGE,"Apart and at peace and alone,"
351,PAGE,He counts the changeless hours.
352,PAGE,He wars with darkling Powers
353,PAGE,(I war with a darkling sea);
354,PAGE,Would he stoop to my work in the gusty mirk?
355,PAGE,(_Shoal! ’Ware shoal!_) Not he!
356,PAGE,
357,PAGE,"There was never a priest to pray,"
358,PAGE,"There was never a hand to toll,"
359,PAGE,"When they made me guard of the bay,"
360,PAGE,And moored me over the shoal.
361,PAGE,"I rock, I reel, and I roll--"
362,PAGE,My four great hammers ply--
363,PAGE,Could I speak or be still at the Church’s will?
364,PAGE,(_Shoal! ’Ware shoal!_) Not I!
365,PAGE,
366,PAGE,"The landward marks have failed,"
367,PAGE,"The fog-bank glides unguessed,"
368,PAGE,"The seaward lights are veiled,"
369,PAGE,The spent deep feigns her rest:
370,PAGE,"But my ear is laid to her breast,"
371,PAGE,I lift to the swell--I cry!
372,PAGE,Could I wait in sloth on the Church’s oath?
373,PAGE,(_Shoal! ’Ware shoal!_) Not I!
374,PAGE,
375,PAGE,At the careless end of night
376,PAGE,I thrill to the nearing screw;
377,PAGE,I turn in the nearing light
378,PAGE,And I call to the drowsy crew;
379,PAGE,And the mud boils foul and blue
380,PAGE,As the blind bow backs away.
381,PAGE,Will they give me their thanks if they clear the banks?
382,PAGE,(_Shoal! ’Ware shoal!_) Not they!
383,PAGE,
384,PAGE,"The beach-pools cake and skim,"
385,PAGE,"The bursting spray-heads freeze,"
386,PAGE,I gather on crown and rim
387,PAGE,"The grey, grained ice of the seas,"
388,PAGE,"Where, sheathed from bitt to trees,"
389,PAGE,The plunging colliers lie.
390,PAGE,Would I barter my place for the Church’s grace?
391,PAGE,(_Shoal! ’Ware shoal!_) Not I!
392,PAGE,
393,PAGE,"Through the blur of the whirling snow,"
394,PAGE,"Or the black of the inky sleet,"
395,PAGE,"The lanterns gather and grow,"
396,PAGE,And I look for the homeward fleet.
397,PAGE,Rattle of block and sheet--
398,PAGE,‘Ready about--stand by!’
399,PAGE,Shall I ask them a fee ere they fetch the quay?
400,PAGE,(_Shoal! ’Ware shoal!_) Not I!
401,PAGE,
402,PAGE,I dip and I surge and I swing
403,PAGE,"In the rip of the racing tide,"
404,PAGE,"By the gates of doom I sing,"
405,PAGE,On the horns of death I ride.
406,PAGE,"A ship-length overside,"
407,PAGE,"Between the course and the sand,"
408,PAGE,Fretted and bound I bide
409,PAGE,Peril whereof I cry.
410,PAGE,Would I change with my brother a league inland?

417,PAGE,
418,PAGE,
419,PAGE,"As our mother the Frigate, bepainted and fine,"
420,PAGE,Made play for her bully the Ship of the Line;
421,PAGE,"So we, her bold daughters by iron and fire,"
422,PAGE,Accost and decoy to our masters’ desire.
423,PAGE,
424,PAGE,"Now pray you consider what toils we endure,"
425,PAGE,"Night-walking wet sea-lanes, a guard and a lure;"
426,PAGE,Since half of our trade is that same pretty sort
427,PAGE,As mettlesome wenches do practise in port.
428,PAGE,
429,PAGE,"For this is our office: to spy and make room,"
430,PAGE,As hiding yet guiding the foe to their doom;
431,PAGE,"Surrounding, confounding, to bait and betray"
432,PAGE,And tempt them to battle the seas’ width away.
433,PAGE,
434,PAGE,The pot-bellied merchant foreboding no wrong
435,PAGE,"With headlight and sidelight he lieth along,"
436,PAGE,"Till, lightless and lightfoot and lurking, leap we"
437,PAGE,To force him discover his business by sea.
438,PAGE,
439,PAGE,"And when we have wakened the lust of a foe,"
440,PAGE,"To draw him by flight toward our bullies we go,"
441,PAGE,"Till, ’ware of strange smoke stealing nearer, he flies--"
442,PAGE,Or our bullies close in for to make him good prize.
443,PAGE,
444,PAGE,"So, when we have spied on the path of their host,"
445,PAGE,One flieth to carry that word to the coast;
446,PAGE,"And, lest by false doubling they turn and go free,"
447,PAGE,One lieth behind them to follow and see.
448,PAGE,
449,PAGE,"Anon we return, being gathered again,"
450,PAGE,Across the sad valleys all drabbled with rain--
451,PAGE,Across the grey ridges all crispèd and curled--
452,PAGE,To join the long dance round the curve of the world.
453,PAGE,
454,PAGE,The bitter salt spindrift: the sun-glare likewise:
455,PAGE,"The moon-track a-quiver bewilders our eyes,"
456,PAGE,"Where, linking and lifting, our sisters we hail"
457,PAGE,’Twixt wrench of cross-surges or plunge of head-gale.
458,PAGE,
459,PAGE,As maidens awaiting the bride to come forth
460,PAGE,"Make play with light jestings and wit of no worth,"
461,PAGE,"So, widdershins circling the bride-bed of death,"
462,PAGE,Each fleereth her neighbour and signeth and saith:--
463,PAGE,
464,PAGE,"‘What see ye? Their signals, or levin afar?"
465,PAGE,"‘What hear ye? God’s thunder, or guns of our war?"
466,PAGE,"‘What mark ye? Their smoke, or the cloud-rack outblown?"
467,PAGE,"‘What chase ye? Their lights, or the Daystar low down?’"
468,PAGE,
469,PAGE,"So, times past all number deceived by false shows,"
470,PAGE,"Deceiving we cumber the road of our foes,"
471,PAGE,For this is our virtue: to track and betray;
472,PAGE,Preparing great battles a sea’s width away.
473,PAGE,
474,PAGE,"_Now peace is at end and our peoples take heart,"
475,PAGE,For the laws are clean gone that restrainèd our art;
476,PAGE,Up and down the near headlands and against the far wind
477,PAGE,We are loosed (O be swift!) to the work of our kind!_

486,PAGE,That seek the single goal;
487,PAGE,"The line that holds the rending course,"
488,PAGE,The hate that swings the whole:
489,PAGE,"The stripped hulls, slinking through the gloom,"
490,PAGE,At gaze and gone again--
491,PAGE,The Brides of Death that wait the groom--
492,PAGE,The Choosers of the Slain!_
493,PAGE,
494,PAGE,Offshore where sea and skyline blend
495,PAGE,"In rain, the daylight dies;"
496,PAGE,"The sullen, shouldering swells attend"
497,PAGE,Night and our sacrifice.
498,PAGE,Adown the stricken capes no flare--
499,PAGE,"No mark on spit or bar,--"
500,PAGE,Girdled and desperate we dare
501,PAGE,The blindfold game of war.
502,PAGE,
503,PAGE,Nearer the up-flung beams that spell
504,PAGE,The council of our foes;
505,PAGE,Clearer the barking guns that tell
506,PAGE,Their scattered flank to close.
507,PAGE,Sheer to the trap they crowd their way
508,PAGE,From ports for this unbarred.
509,PAGE,"Quiet, and count our laden prey,"
510,PAGE,The convoy and her guard!
511,PAGE,
512,PAGE,"On shoal with scarce a foot below,"
513,PAGE,"Where rock and islet throng,"
514,PAGE,Hidden and hushed we watch them throw
515,PAGE,Their anxious lights along.
516,PAGE,"Not here, not here your danger lies--"
517,PAGE,"(Stare hard, O hooded eyne!)"
518,PAGE,Save where the dazed rock-pigeons rise
519,PAGE,The lit cliffs give no sign.
520,PAGE,
521,PAGE,"Therefore--to break the rest ye seek,"
522,PAGE,The Narrow Seas to clear--
523,PAGE,Hark to the siren’s whimpering shriek--
524,PAGE,The driven death is here!
525,PAGE,"Look to your van a league away,--"
526,PAGE,What midnight terror stays
527,PAGE,The bulk that checks against the spray
528,PAGE,Her crackling tops ablaze?
529,PAGE,
530,PAGE,"Hit, and hard hit! The blow went home,"
531,PAGE,"The muffled, knocking stroke--"
532,PAGE,The steam that overruns the foam--
533,PAGE,The foam that thins to smoke--
534,PAGE,The smoke that clokes the deep aboil--
535,PAGE,The deep that chokes her throes
536,PAGE,"Till, streaked with ash and sleeked with oil,"
537,PAGE,The lukewarm whirlpools close!
538,PAGE,
539,PAGE,A shadow down the sickened wave
540,PAGE,Long since her slayer fled:
541,PAGE,But hear their chattering quick-fires rave
542,PAGE,"Astern, abeam, ahead!"
543,PAGE,Panic that shells the drifting spar--
544,PAGE,Loud waste with none to check--
545,PAGE,Mad fear that rakes a scornful star
546,PAGE,Or sweeps a consort’s deck!
547,PAGE,
548,PAGE,"Now, while their silly smoke hangs thick,"
549,PAGE,"Now ere their wits they find,"
550,PAGE,Lay in and lance them to the quick--
551,PAGE,Our gallied whales are blind!
552,PAGE,"Good luck to those that see the end,"
553,PAGE,Good-bye to those that drown--
554,PAGE,For each his chance as chance shall send--
555,PAGE,And God for all! _Shut down!_
556,PAGE,
557,PAGE,_The strength of twice three thousand horse
558,PAGE,That serve the one command;
559,PAGE,"The hand that heaves the headlong force,"
560,PAGE,The hate that hacks the hand:
561,PAGE,"The doom-bolt in the darkness freed,"

667,PAGE,THE SECOND VOYAGE  [Page 23]
668,PAGE,
669,PAGE,
670,PAGE,We’ve sent our little Cupids all ashore--
671,PAGE,"They were frightened, they were tired, they were cold;"
672,PAGE,"Our sails of silk and purple go to store,"
673,PAGE,And we’ve cut away our mast of beaten gold.
674,PAGE,(Foul weather!)
675,PAGE,"Oh ’tis hemp and singing pine for to stand against the brine,"
676,PAGE,But Love he is the master as of old!
677,PAGE,
678,PAGE,"The sea has shorn our galleries away,"
679,PAGE,The salt has soiled our gilding past remede;
680,PAGE,"Our paint is flaked and blistered by the spray,"
681,PAGE,"Our sides are half a fathom furred in weed,"
682,PAGE,(Foul weather!)
683,PAGE,"And the doves of Venus fled and the petrels came instead,"
684,PAGE,But Love he was our master at our need!
685,PAGE,
686,PAGE,"’Was Youth would keep no vigil at the bow,"
687,PAGE,’Was Pleasure at the helm too drunk to steer--
688,PAGE,"We’ve shipped three able quartermasters now,"
689,PAGE,"Men call them Custom, Reverence, and Fear."
690,PAGE,(Foul weather!)
691,PAGE,"They are old and scarred and plain, but we’ll run no risk again"
692,PAGE,From any Port o’ Paphos mutineer!
693,PAGE,
694,PAGE,"We seek no more the tempest for delight,"
695,PAGE,We skirt no more the indraught and the shoal--
696,PAGE,We ask no more of any day or night
697,PAGE,Than to come with least adventure to our goal.
698,PAGE,(Foul weather!)
699,PAGE,"What we find we needs must brook, but we do not go to look,"
700,PAGE,Nor tempt the Lord our God that saved us whole!
701,PAGE,
702,PAGE,"Yet, caring so, not overly we care"
703,PAGE,"To brace and trim for every foolish blast,"
704,PAGE,"If the squall be pleased to sweep us unaware,"
705,PAGE,He may bellow off to leeward like the last.
706,PAGE,(Foul weather!)
707,PAGE,"We will blame it on the deep (for the watch must have their sleep),"
708,PAGE,And Love can come and wake us when ’tis past.
709,PAGE,
710,PAGE,"Oh launch them down with music from the beach,"
711,PAGE,Oh warp them out with garlands from the quays--
712,PAGE,Most resolute--a damsel unto each--
713,PAGE,New prows that seek the old Hesperides!
714,PAGE,(Foul weather!)
715,PAGE,"Though we know the voyage is vain, yet we see our path again"
716,PAGE,In the saffroned bridesails scenting all the seas!
717,PAGE,(Foul weather!)

722,PAGE,THE DYKES  [Page 26]
723,PAGE,
724,PAGE,
725,PAGE,"We have no heart for the fishing, we have no hand for the oar--"
726,PAGE,All that our fathers taught us of old pleases us now no more;
727,PAGE,All that our own hearts bid us believe we doubt where we do not deny--
728,PAGE,There is no proof in the bread we eat or rest in the toil we ply.
729,PAGE,
730,PAGE,"Look you, our foreshore stretches far through sea-gate, dyke, and"
731,PAGE,groin--
732,PAGE,"Made land all, that our fathers made, where the flats and the fairway"
733,PAGE,join.
734,PAGE,"They forced the sea a sea-league back. They died, and their work"
735,PAGE,stood fast.
736,PAGE,"We were born to peace in the lee of the dykes, but the time of our"
737,PAGE,peace is past.
738,PAGE,
739,PAGE,"Far off, the full tide clambers and slips, mouthing and testing"
740,PAGE,"all,"
741,PAGE,"Nipping the flanks of the water-gates, baying along the wall;"
742,PAGE,"Turning the shingle, returning the shingle, changing the set of the"
743,PAGE,sand ...
744,PAGE,"We are too far from the beach, men say, to know how the outworks"
745,PAGE,stand.
746,PAGE,
747,PAGE,"So we come down, uneasy, to look, uneasily pacing the beach."
748,PAGE,These are the dykes our fathers made: we have never known a
749,PAGE,breach.
750,PAGE,Time and again has the gale blown by and we were not afraid;
751,PAGE,Now we come only to look at the dykes--at the dykes our fathers
752,PAGE,made.
753,PAGE,
754,PAGE,O’er the marsh where the homesteads cower apart the harried sunlight
755,PAGE,"flies,"
756,PAGE,"Shifts and considers, wanes and recovers, scatters and sickens and"
757,PAGE,dies--
758,PAGE,An evil ember bedded in ash--a spark blown west by the wind ...
759,PAGE,We are surrendered to night and the sea--the gale and the tide
760,PAGE,behind!
761,PAGE,
762,PAGE,"At the bridge of the lower saltings the cattle gather and blare,"
763,PAGE,"Roused by the feet of running men, dazed by the lantern glare."
764,PAGE,Unbar and let them away for their lives--the levels drown as they
765,PAGE,"stand,"
766,PAGE,Where the flood-wash forces the sluices aback and the ditches deliver
767,PAGE,inland.
768,PAGE,
769,PAGE,"Ninefold deep to the top of the dykes the galloping breakers stride,"
770,PAGE,And their overcarried spray is a sea--a sea on the landward side.
771,PAGE,"Coming, like stallions they paw with their hooves, going they snatch"
772,PAGE,"with their teeth,"
773,PAGE,"Till the bents and the furze and the sand are dragged out, and the"
774,PAGE,old-time wattles beneath!
775,PAGE,
776,PAGE,"Bid men gather fuel for fire, the tar and the oil and the tow--"
777,PAGE,"Flame we shall need, not smoke, in the dark if the riddled seabanks"
778,PAGE,go.
779,PAGE,Bid the ringers watch in the tower (who knows what the dawn shall
780,PAGE,prove?)
781,PAGE,Each with his rope between his feet and the trembling bells above.
782,PAGE,
783,PAGE,"Now we can only wait till the day, wait and apportion our shame."
784,PAGE,"These are the dykes our fathers left, but we would not look to the"
785,PAGE,same.
786,PAGE,"Time and again were we warned of the dykes, time and again we"
787,PAGE,delayed:
788,PAGE,"Now, it may fall, we have slain our sons as our fathers we have"
789,PAGE,betrayed.
790,PAGE,
791,PAGE,*       *       *       *       *
792,PAGE,
793,PAGE,"Walking along the wreck of the dykes, watching the work of the seas,"
794,PAGE,These were the dykes our fathers made to our great profit and ease;
795,PAGE,"But the peace is gone and the profit is gone, and the old sure day"
796,PAGE,withdrawn ...
797,PAGE,That our own houses show as strange when we come back in the dawn!

803,PAGE,
804,PAGE,
805,PAGE,The God of Fair Beginnings
806,PAGE,Hath prospered here my hand--
807,PAGE,"The cargoes of my lading,"
808,PAGE,And the keels of my command.
809,PAGE,For out of many ventures
810,PAGE,"That sailed with hope as high,"
811,PAGE,"My own have made the better trade,"
812,PAGE,And Admiral am I!
813,PAGE,
814,PAGE,"To me my King’s much honour,"
815,PAGE,To me my people’s love--
816,PAGE,To me the pride of Princes
817,PAGE,And power all pride above;
818,PAGE,"To me the shouting cities,"
819,PAGE,To me the mob’s refrain:--
820,PAGE,"‘Who knows not noble Valdez,"
821,PAGE,Hath never heard of Spain.’
822,PAGE,
823,PAGE,But I remember comrades--
824,PAGE,Old playmates on new seas--
825,PAGE,Whenas we traded orpiment
826,PAGE,Among the savages--
827,PAGE,A thousand leagues to south’ard
828,PAGE,And thirty years removed--
829,PAGE,"They knew not noble Valdez,"
830,PAGE,But me they knew and loved.
831,PAGE,
832,PAGE,"Then they that found good liquor,"
833,PAGE,"They drank it not alone,"
834,PAGE,"And they that found fair plunder,"
835,PAGE,"They told us every one,"
836,PAGE,About our chosen islands
837,PAGE,"Or secret shoals between,"
838,PAGE,"When, walty from far voyage,"
839,PAGE,We gathered to careen.
840,PAGE,
841,PAGE,There burned our breaming-fagots
842,PAGE,All pale along the shore:
843,PAGE,There rose our worn pavilions--
844,PAGE,A sail above an oar:
845,PAGE,As flashed each yearning anchor
846,PAGE,"Through mellow seas afire,"
847,PAGE,So swift our careless captains
848,PAGE,Rowed each to his desire.
849,PAGE,
850,PAGE,Where lay our loosened harness?
851,PAGE,Where turned our naked feet?
852,PAGE,Whose tavern ’mid the palm-trees?
853,PAGE,What quenchings of what heat?
854,PAGE,Oh fountain in the desert!
855,PAGE,Oh cistern in the waste!
856,PAGE,Oh bread we ate in secret!
857,PAGE,Oh cup we spilled in haste!
858,PAGE,
859,PAGE,"The youth new-taught of longing,"
860,PAGE,The widow curbed and wan--
861,PAGE,"The goodwife proud at season,"
862,PAGE,And the maid aware of man;
863,PAGE,"All souls unslaked, consuming,"
864,PAGE,"Defrauded in delays,"
865,PAGE,Desire not more their quittance
866,PAGE,Than I those forfeit days!
867,PAGE,
868,PAGE,I dreamed to wait my pleasure
869,PAGE,Unchanged my spring would bide:
870,PAGE,"Wherefore, to wait my pleasure,"
871,PAGE,I put my spring aside
872,PAGE,"Till, first in face of Fortune,"
873,PAGE,"And last in mazed disdain,"
874,PAGE,I made Diego Valdez
875,PAGE,High Admiral of Spain.
876,PAGE,
877,PAGE,Then walked no wind ’neath Heaven
878,PAGE,Nor surge that did not aid--
879,PAGE,"I dared extreme occasion,"
880,PAGE,Nor ever one betrayed.
881,PAGE,They wrought a deeper treason--
882,PAGE,(Led seas that served my needs!)
883,PAGE,They sold Diego Valdez
884,PAGE,To bondage of great deeds.
885,PAGE,
886,PAGE,"The tempest flung me seaward,"
887,PAGE,And pinned and bade me hold
888,PAGE,The course I might not alter--
889,PAGE,And men esteemed me bold!
890,PAGE,"The calms embayed my quarry,"
891,PAGE,The fog-wreath sealed his eyes;
892,PAGE,The dawn-wind brought my topsails--
893,PAGE,And men esteemed me wise!
894,PAGE,
895,PAGE,Yet ’spite my tyrant triumphs
896,PAGE,"Bewildered, dispossessed--"
897,PAGE,My dream held I before me--
898,PAGE,My vision of my rest;
899,PAGE,"But, crowned by Fleet and People,"
900,PAGE,And bound by King and Pope--
901,PAGE,Stands here Diego Valdez
902,PAGE,To rob me of my hope!
903,PAGE,
904,PAGE,"No prayer of mine shall move him,"
905,PAGE,No word of his set free
906,PAGE,The Lord of Sixty Pennants
907,PAGE,And the Steward of the Sea.
908,PAGE,His will can loose ten thousand
909,PAGE,To seek their loves again--
910,PAGE,"But not Diego Valdez,"
911,PAGE,High Admiral of Spain.
912,PAGE,
913,PAGE,There walks no wind ’neath Heaven
914,PAGE,Nor wave that shall restore
915,PAGE,The old careening riot
916,PAGE,"And the clamorous, crowded shore--"
917,PAGE,"The fountain in the desert,"
918,PAGE,"The cistern in the waste,"
919,PAGE,"The bread we ate in secret,"
920,PAGE,The cup we spilled in haste!
921,PAGE,
922,PAGE,Now call I to my Captains--
923,PAGE,"For council fly the sign,"
924,PAGE,Now leap their zealous galleys
925,PAGE,Twelve-oared across the brine.
926,PAGE,"To me the straiter prison,"
927,PAGE,To me the heavier chain--
928,PAGE,"To me Diego Valdez,"
929,PAGE,High Admiral of Spain!

935,PAGE,
936,PAGE,
937,PAGE,"For things we never mention,"

939,PAGE,For excellent intention
940,PAGE,That did not turn to good;
941,PAGE,"From ancient tales’ renewing,"
942,PAGE,From clouds we would not clear--
943,PAGE,Beyond the Law’s pursuing
944,PAGE,"We fled, and settled here."
945,PAGE,
946,PAGE,"We took no tearful leaving,"
947,PAGE,We bade no long good-byes;
948,PAGE,"Men talked of crime and thieving,"
949,PAGE,Men wrote of fraud and lies.
950,PAGE,To save our injured feelings
951,PAGE,’Twas time and time to go--
952,PAGE,"Behind was dock and Dartmoor,"
953,PAGE,Ahead lay Callao!
954,PAGE,
955,PAGE,The widow and the orphan
956,PAGE,"That pray for ten per cent.,"
957,PAGE,They clapped their trailers on us
958,PAGE,To spy the road we went.
959,PAGE,They watched the foreign sailings
960,PAGE,"(They scan the shipping still),"
961,PAGE,And that’s your Christian people
962,PAGE,Returning good for ill!
963,PAGE,
964,PAGE,God bless the thoughtful islands
965,PAGE,Where never warrants come!
966,PAGE,God bless the just Republics
967,PAGE,"That give a man a home,"
968,PAGE,"That ask no foolish questions,"
969,PAGE,But set him on his feet;
970,PAGE,And save his wife and daughters
971,PAGE,From the workhouse and the street!
972,PAGE,
973,PAGE,On church and square and market
974,PAGE,The noonday silence falls;
975,PAGE,You’ll hear the drowsy mutter
976,PAGE,Of the fountain in our halls.
977,PAGE,Asleep amid the yuccas
978,PAGE,The city takes her ease--
979,PAGE,Till twilight brings the land-wind
980,PAGE,To our clicking jalousies.
981,PAGE,
982,PAGE,"Day long the diamond weather,"
983,PAGE,"The high, unaltered blue--"
984,PAGE,The smell of goats and incense
985,PAGE,And the mule-bells tinkling through.
986,PAGE,Day long the warder ocean
987,PAGE,"That keeps us from our kin,"
988,PAGE,And once a month our levee
989,PAGE,When the English mail comes in.
990,PAGE,
991,PAGE,You’ll find us up and waiting
992,PAGE,To treat you at the bar;

994,PAGE,Than the average English are.
995,PAGE,"We’ll meet you with our carriage,"
996,PAGE,"Too glad to show you round,"
997,PAGE,"But--we do not lunch on steamers,"
998,PAGE,For they are English ground.
999,PAGE,
1000,PAGE,We sail o’ nights to England
1001,PAGE,And join our smiling Boards;
1002,PAGE,Our wives go in with Viscounts
1003,PAGE,And our daughters dance with Lords.
1004,PAGE,"But behind our princely doings,"
1005,PAGE,"And behind each coup we make,"
1006,PAGE,"We feel there’s Something Waiting,"
1007,PAGE,And--we meet It when we wake.
1008,PAGE,
1009,PAGE,Ah God! One sniff of England--
1010,PAGE,To greet our flesh and blood--
1011,PAGE,To hear the hansoms slurring
1012,PAGE,Once more through London mud!
1013,PAGE,Our towns of wasted honour--

1155,IV,"‘There was a flint in my musket--pricked and primed was the pan,"
1156,IV,When I went hunting Adam-zad--the Bear that stands like a man.
1157,IV,"I looked my last on the timber, I looked my last on the snow,"
1158,IV,When I went hunting Adam-zad fifty summers ago!
1159,IV,
1160,IV,"‘I knew his times and his seasons, as he knew mine, that fed"
1161,IV,By night in the ripened maizefield and robbed my house of bread;
1162,IV,"I knew his strength and cunning, as he knew mine, that crept"
1163,IV,At dawn to the crowded goat-pens and plundered while I slept.
1164,IV,
1165,IV,‘Up from his stony playground--down from his well-digged lair--
1166,IV,Out on the naked ridges ran Adam-zad the Bear;
1167,IV,"Groaning, grunting, and roaring, heavy with stolen meals,"
1168,IV,"Two long marches to northward, and I was at his heels!"
1169,IV,
1170,IV,"‘Two full marches to northward, at the fall of the second night,"
1171,IV,I came on mine enemy Adam-zad all panting from his flight.
1172,IV,There was a charge in the musket--pricked and primed was the pan--
1173,IV,My finger crooked on the trigger--when he reared up like a man.
1174,IV,
1175,IV,"‘Horrible, hairy, human, with paws like hands in prayer,"
1176,IV,Making his supplication rose Adam-zad the Bear!
1177,IV,"I looked at the swaying shoulders, at the paunch’s swag and swing,"
1178,IV,"And my heart was touched with pity for the monstrous, pleading thing."
1179,IV,
1180,IV,"‘Touched with pity and wonder, I did not fire then ..."
1181,IV,I have looked no more on women--I have walked no more with men.
1182,IV,"Nearer he tottered and nearer, with paws like hands that pray--"
1183,IV,"From brow to jaw that steel-shod paw, it ripped my face away!"
1184,IV,
1185,IV,"‘Sudden, silent, and savage, searing as flame the blow--"
1186,IV,"Faceless I fell before his feet, fifty summers ago."
1187,IV,"I heard him grunt and chuckle--I heard him pass to his den,"
1188,IV,He left me blind to the darkened years and the little mercy of men.
1189,IV,
1190,IV,"‘Now ye go down in the morning with guns of the newer style,"
1191,IV,That load (I have felt) in the middle and range (I have heard) a mile?
1192,IV,"Luck to the white man’s rifle, that shoots so fast and true,"
1193,IV,"But--pay, and I lift my bandage and show what the Bear can do!’"
1194,IV,
1195,IV,"(Flesh like slag in the furnace, knobbed and withered and grey--"
1196,IV,"Matun, the old blind beggar, he gives good worth for his pay.)"
1197,IV,"‘Rouse him at noon in the bushes, follow and press him hard--"
1198,IV,Not for his ragings and roarings flinch ye from Adam-zad.
1199,IV,
1200,IV,"‘But (pay, and I put back the bandage) this is the time to fear,"
1201,IV,"When he stands up like a tired man, tottering near and near;"
1202,IV,"When he stands up as pleading, in wavering, man-brute guise,"
1203,IV,"When he veils the hate and cunning of the little, swinish eyes;"
1204,IV,"‘When he shows as seeking quarter, with paws like hands in prayer,"
1205,IV,_That_ is the time of peril--the time of the Truce of the Bear!’
1206,IV,
1207,IV,"Eyeless, noseless, and lipless, asking a dole at the door,"
1208,IV,"Matun, the old blind beggar, he tells it o’er and o’er;"
1209,IV,"Fumbling and feeling the rifles, warming his hands at the flame,"
1210,IV,Hearing our careless white men talk of the morrow’s game;
1211,IV,
1212,IV,"Over and over the story, ending as he began:--"
1213,IV,"‘_There is no truce with Adam-zad, the Bear that looks like a man!_’"

1218,IV,THE OLD MEN  [Page 57]
1219,IV,
1220,IV,
1221,IV,_This is our lot if we live so long and labour unto the end--
1222,IV,That we outlive the impatient years and the much too patient friend:
1223,IV,And because we know we have breath in our mouth and think we have
1224,IV,"thought in our head,"
1225,IV,"We shall assume that we are alive, whereas we are really dead._"
1226,IV,
1227,IV,We shall not acknowledge that old stars fade or alien planets arise
1228,IV,(That the sere bush buds or the desert blooms or the ancient
1229,IV,"well-head dries),"
1230,IV,Or any new compass wherewith new men adventure ’neath new skies.
1231,IV,
1232,IV,We shall lift up the ropes that constrained our youth to bind on our
1233,IV,children’s hands;
1234,IV,We shall call to the water below the bridges to return and replenish
1235,IV,our lands;
1236,IV,We shall harness horses (Death’s own pale horses) and scholarly
1237,IV,plough the sands.
1238,IV,
1239,IV,We shall lie down in the eye of the sun for lack of a light on our
1240,IV,way--
1241,IV,"We shall rise up when the day is done and chirrup, ‘Behold, it is"
1242,IV,day!’
1243,IV,We shall abide till the battle is won ere we amble into the fray.
1244,IV,
1245,IV,"We shall peck out and discuss and dissect, and evert and extrude to"
1246,IV,"our mind,"
1247,IV,The flaccid tissues of long-dead issues offensive to God and mankind--
1248,IV,(Precisely like vultures over an ox that the Army has left behind).
1249,IV,
1250,IV,We shall make walk preposterous ghosts of the glories we once created--
1251,IV,(Immodestly smearing from muddled palettes amazing pigments mismated)
1252,IV,And our friends will weep when we ask them with boasts if our natural
1253,IV,force be abated.
1254,IV,
1255,IV,The Lamp of our Youth will be utterly out: but we shall subsist on
1256,IV,"the smell of it,"
1257,IV,"And whatever we do, we shall fold our hands and suck our gums and"
1258,IV,think well of it.
1259,IV,"Yes, we shall be perfectly pleased with our work, And that is the"
1260,IV,perfectest Hell of it!
1261,IV,
1262,IV,_This is our lot if we live so long and listen to those who love us--
1263,IV,That we are shunned by the people about and shamed by the Powers
1264,IV,above us.
1265,IV,"Wherefore be free of your harness betimes; but being free be assured,"
1266,IV,"That he who hath not endured to the death, from his birth he hath"
1267,IV,never endured!_

1272,IV,THE EXPLORER  [Page 61]
1273,IV,
1274,IV,
1275,IV,"‘There’s no sense in going further--it’s the edge of cultivation,’"
1276,IV,"So they said, and I believed it--broke my land and sowed my crop--"
1277,IV,Built my barns and strung my fences in the little border station
1278,IV,Tucked away below the foothills where the trails run out and stop.
1279,IV,
1280,IV,"Till a voice, as bad as Conscience, rang interminable changes"
1281,IV,On one everlasting Whisper day and night repeated--so:
1282,IV,‘Something hidden. Go and find it. Go and look behind the Ranges--
1283,IV,‘Something lost behind the Ranges. Lost and waiting for you. Go!’
1284,IV,
1285,IV,"So I went, worn out of patience; ’never told my nearest neighbours--"
1286,IV,Stole away with pack and ponies--left ’em drinking in the town;
1287,IV,And the faith that moveth mountains didn’t seem to help my labours
1288,IV,"As I faced the sheer main-ranges, whipping up and leading down."
1289,IV,
1290,IV,"March by march I puzzled through ’em, turning flanks and dodging"
1291,IV,"shoulders,"
1292,IV,"Hurried on in hope of water, headed back for lack of grass;"
1293,IV,Till I camped above the tree-line--drifted snow and naked boulders--
1294,IV,Felt free air astir to windward--knew I’d stumbled on the Pass.
1295,IV,
1296,IV,’Thought to name it for the finder: but that night the Norther found
1297,IV,me--
1298,IV,Froze and killed the plains-bred ponies; so I called the camp
1299,IV,Despair
1300,IV,"(It’s the Railway Gap to-day, though). Then my Whisper waked to hound"
1301,IV,me:--
1302,IV,‘Something lost behind the Ranges. Over yonder. Go you there!’
1303,IV,
1304,IV,"Then I knew, the while I doubted--knew His Hand was certain o’er me."
1305,IV,Still--it might be self-delusion--scores of better men had died--
1306,IV,"I could reach the township living, but ... He knows what terrors tore"
1307,IV,me ...
1308,IV,But I didn’t ... but I didn’t. I went down the other side.
1309,IV,
1310,IV,"Till the snow ran out in flowers, and the flowers turned to aloes,"
1311,IV,And the aloes sprung to thickets and a brimming stream ran by;
1312,IV,"But the thickets dwined to thorn-scrub, and the water drained to"
1313,IV,shallows--
1314,IV,"And I dropped again on desert, blasted earth, and blasting sky...."
1315,IV,
1316,IV,I remember lighting fires; I remember sitting by them;
1317,IV,"I remember seeing faces, hearing voices through the smoke;"
1318,IV,I remember they were fancy--for I threw a stone to try ’em.
1319,IV,"‘Something lost behind the Ranges,’ was the only word they spoke."
1320,IV,
1321,IV,I remember going crazy. I remember that I knew it
1322,IV,When I heard myself hallooing to the funny folk I saw.
1323,IV,Very full of dreams that desert: but my two legs took me through it ...
1324,IV,And I used to watch ’em moving with the toes all black and raw.
1325,IV,
1326,IV,But at last the country altered--White man’s country past disputing--
1327,IV,"Rolling grass and open timber, with a hint of hills behind--"
1328,IV,"There I found me food and water, and I lay a week recruiting,"
1329,IV,Got my strength and lost my nightmares. Then I entered on my find.
1330,IV,
1331,IV,Thence I ran my first rough survey--chose my trees and blazed and
1332,IV,ringed ’em--
1333,IV,Week by week I pried and sampled--week by week my findings grew.
1334,IV,"Saul he went to look for donkeys, and by God he found a kingdom!"
1335,IV,"But by God, who sent His Whisper, I had struck the worth of two!"
1336,IV,
1337,IV,"Up along the hostile mountains, where the hair-poised snow-slide"
1338,IV,shivers--
1339,IV,Down and through the big fat marshes that the virgin ore-bed
1340,IV,"stains,"
1341,IV,"Till I heard the mile-wide mutterings of unimagined rivers,"
1342,IV,And beyond the nameless timber saw illimitable plains!
1343,IV,
1344,IV,"’Plotted sites of future cities, traced the easy grades between ’em;"
1345,IV,Watched unharnessed rapids wasting fifty thousand head an hour;
1346,IV,Counted leagues of water-frontage through the axe-ripe woods that
1347,IV,screen ’em--
1348,IV,Saw the plant to feed a people--up and waiting for the power!
1349,IV,
1350,IV,Well I know who’ll take the credit--all the clever chaps that
1351,IV,followed--
1352,IV,"Came, a dozen men together--never knew my desert fears;"
1353,IV,"Tracked me by the camps I’d quitted, used the water-holes I’d"
1354,IV,hollowed.
1355,IV,They’ll go back and do the talking. They’ll be called the
1356,IV,Pioneers!
1357,IV,
1358,IV,They will find my sites of townships--not the cities that I set
1359,IV,there.
1360,IV,They will rediscover rivers--not my rivers heard at night.
1361,IV,"By my own old marks and bearings they will show me how to get there,"
1362,IV,By the lonely cairns I builded they will guide my feet aright.
1363,IV,
1364,IV,Have I named one single river? Have I claimed one single acre?
1365,IV,"Have I kept one single nugget--(barring samples)? No, not I."
1366,IV,Because my price was paid me ten times over by my Maker.
1367,IV,But you wouldn’t understand it. You go up and occupy.
1368,IV,
1369,IV,Ores you’ll find there; wood and cattle; water-transit sure and
1370,IV,steady
1371,IV,"(That should keep the railway rates down), coal and iron at your"
1372,IV,doors.
1373,IV,"God took care to hide that country till He judged His people ready,"
1374,IV,"Then He chose me for His Whisper, and I’ve found it, and it’s yours!"
1375,IV,
1376,IV,"Yes, your ‘Never-never country’--yes, your ‘edge of cultivation’"
1377,IV,And ‘no sense in going further’--till I crossed the range to see.
1378,IV,"God forgive me! No, _I_ didn’t. It’s God’s present to our nation."
1379,IV,Anybody might have found it but--His Whisper came to Me!

1387,IV,Oh glorious are the guarded heights
1388,IV,Where guardian souls abide--
1389,IV,Self-exiled from our gross delights--
1390,IV,"Above, beyond, outside:"
1391,IV,An ampler arc their spirit swings--
1392,IV,Commands a juster view--
1393,IV,"We have their word for all these things,"
1394,IV,Nor doubt their words are true.
1395,IV,
1396,IV,"Yet we the bondslaves of our day,"
1397,IV,Whom dirt and danger press--
1398,IV,"Co-heirs of insolence, delay,"
1399,IV,And leagued unfaithfulness--
1400,IV,Such is our need must seek indeed
1401,IV,"And, having found, engage"
1402,IV,The men who merely do the work
1403,IV,For which they draw the wage.
1404,IV,
1405,IV,"From forge and farm and mine and bench,"
1406,IV,"Deck, altar, outpost lone--"
1407,IV,"Mill, school, battalion, counter, trench,"
1408,IV,"Rail, senate, sheepfold, throne--"
1409,IV,Creation’s cry goes up on high
1410,IV,From age to cheated age:
1411,IV,‘Send us the men who do the work
1412,IV,For which they draw the wage.’
1413,IV,

1415,IV,"Nor e’en the all-gifted fool,"
1416,IV,"Too weak to enter, bide, or leave"
1417,IV,The lists he cannot rule.
1418,IV,Beneath the sun we count on none
1419,IV,"Our evil to assuage,"
1420,IV,Except the men that do the work
1421,IV,For which they draw the wage.
1422,IV,
1423,IV,When through the Gates of Stress and Strain
1424,IV,Comes forth the vast Event--
1425,IV,"The simple, sheer, sufficing, sane"
1426,IV,Result of labour spent--
1427,IV,They that have wrought the end unthought
1428,IV,"Be neither saint nor sage,"
1429,IV,But men who merely did the work
1430,IV,For which they drew the wage.
1431,IV,
1432,IV,Wherefore to these the Fates shall bend
1433,IV,(And all old idle things--)
1434,IV,Wherefore on these shall Power attend
1435,IV,Beyond the grasp of kings:
1436,IV,"Each in his place, by right, not grace,"
1437,IV,Shall rule his heritage--
1438,IV,The men who simply do the work
1439,IV,For which they draw the wage.
1440,IV,
1441,IV,"Not such as scorn the loitering street,"
1442,IV,"Or waste to earn its praise,"
1443,IV,Their noontide’s unreturning heat
1444,IV,About their morning ways:
1445,IV,But such as dower each mortgaged hour
1446,IV,Alike with clean courage--
1447,IV,Even the men who do the work
1448,IV,For which they draw the wage--
1449,IV,Men like to Gods that do the work
1450,IV,For which they draw the wage--

1452,IV,For which they draw the wage!
