149,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
150,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,_(St. Barbara is the patron saint of artillery and of those in
151,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,danger of sudden death.)_
152,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
153,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
154,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"When the long grey lines came flooding upon Paris in the plain,"
155,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,We stood and drank of the last free air we never could taste again:
156,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"They had led us back from the lost battle, to halt we knew not where"
157,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And stilled us; and our gaping guns were dumb with our despair.
158,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,The grey tribes flowed for ever from the infinite lifeless lands
159,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"And a Norman to a Breton spoke, his chin upon his hands."
160,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
161,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"""There was an end to Ilium; and an end came to Rome;"
162,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And a man plays on a painted stage in the land that he calls home;
163,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Arch after arch of triumph, but floor beyond falling floor,"
164,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"That lead to a low door at last; and beyond there is no door."""
165,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
166,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"And the Breton to the Norman spoke, like a small child spoke he,"
167,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And his sea-blue eyes were empty as his home beside the sea:
168,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"""There are more windows in one house than there are eyes to see,"
169,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"There are more doors in a man's house, but God has hid the key:"
170,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Ruin is a builder of windows; her legend witnesseth
171,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Barbara, the saint of gunners, and a stay in sudden death."""
172,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
173,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"It seemed the wheel of the world stood still an instant in its turning,"
174,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,More than the kings of the earth that turned with the turning of Valmy
175,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,mill:
176,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"While trickled the idle tale and the sea-blue eyes were burning,"
177,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Still as the heart of a whirlwind the heart of the world stood still.
178,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
179,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"""Barbara the beautiful"
180,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Had praise of lute and pen:
181,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Her hair was like a summer night
182,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Dark and desired of men.
183,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
184,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Her feet like birds from far away
185,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,That linger and light in doubt;
186,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And her face was like a window
187,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Where a man's first love looked out.
188,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
189,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Her sire was master of many slaves
190,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,A hard man of his hands;
191,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,They built a tower about her
192,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"In the desolate golden lands,"
193,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
194,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Sealed as the tyrants sealed their tombs,"
195,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Planned with an ancient plan,"
196,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And set two windows in the tower
197,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Like the two eyes of a man."""
198,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
199,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Our guns were set toward the foe; we had no word, for firing."
200,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Grey in the gateway of St. Gond the Guard of the tyrant shone;
201,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Dark with the fate of a falling star, retiring and retiring,"
202,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,The Breton line went backward and the Breton tale went on.
203,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
204,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"""Her father had sailed across the sea"
205,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,From the harbour of Africa
206,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,When all the slaves took up their tools
207,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,For the bidding of Barbara.
208,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
209,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,She smote the bare wall with her hand
210,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And bad them smite again;
211,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,She poured them wealth of wine and meat
212,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,To stay them in their pain.
213,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
214,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And cried through the lifted thunder
215,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Of thronging hammer and hod
216,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,'Throw open the third window
217,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,In the third name of God.'
218,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
219,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Then the hearts failed and the tools fell,"
220,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"And far towards the foam,"
221,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Men saw a shadow on the sands
222,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"And her father coming home."""
223,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
224,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Speak low and low, along the line the whispered word is flying"
225,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Before the touch, before the time, we may not loose a breath:"
226,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Their guns must mash us to the mire and there be no replying,"
227,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Till the hand is raised to fling us for the final dice to death.
228,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
229,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"""There were two windows in your tower,"
230,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Barbara, Barbara,"
231,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,For all between the sun and moon
232,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,In the lands of Africa.
233,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
234,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Hath a man three eyes, Barbara,"
235,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"A bird three wings,"
236,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,That you have riven roof and wall
237,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"To look upon vain things?"""
238,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
239,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Her voice was like a wandering thing
240,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"That falters yet is free,"
241,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Whose soul has drunk in a distant land
242,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Of the rivers of liberty.
243,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
244,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"""There are more wings than the wind knows"
245,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Or eyes than see the sun
246,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,In the light of the lost window
247,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And the wind of the doors undone.
248,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
249,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,For out of the first lattice
250,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Are the red lands that break
251,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And out of the second lattice
252,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Sea like a green snake,"
253,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
254,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,But out of the third lattice
255,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Under low eaves like wings
256,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Is a new corner of the sky
257,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"And the other side of things."""
258,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
259,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"It opened in the inmost place an instant beyond uttering,"
260,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"A casement and a chasm and a thunder of doors undone,"
261,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"A seraph's strong wing shaken out the shock of its unshuttering,"
262,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,That split the shattered sunlight from a light behind the sun.
263,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
264,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"""Then he drew sword and drave her"
265,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Where the judges sat and said
266,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"'Caesar sits above the gods,"
267,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Barbara the maid.
268,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
269,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Caesar hath made a treaty
270,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"With the moon and with the sun,"
271,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,All the gods that men can praise
272,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Praise him every one.
273,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
274,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,There is peace with the anointed
275,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Of the scarlet oils of Bel,"
276,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"With the Fish God, where the whirlpool"
277,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Is a winding stair to hell,"
278,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
279,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"With the pathless pyramids of slime,"
280,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Where the mitred negro lifts
281,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,To his black cherub in the cloud
282,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Abominable gifts,"
283,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
284,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,With the leprous silver cities
285,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Where the dumb priests dance and nod,"
286,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,But not with the three windows
287,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"And the last name of God.'"""
288,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
289,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"They are firing, we are falling, and the red skies rend and shiver us,"
290,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Barbara, Barbara, we may not loose a breath--"
291,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Be at the bursting doors of doom, and in the dark deliver us,"
292,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Who loosen the last window on the sun of sudden death.
293,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
294,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"""Barbara the beautiful"
295,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Stood up as queen set free,"
296,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Whose mouth is set to a terrible cup
297,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And the trumpet of liberty.
298,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
299,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,'I have looked forth from a window

309,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,The sword upon his shoulder
310,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Shifted and shone and fell,"

312,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"And crumpled like a shell."""
313,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,
314,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,What wall upon what hinges turned stands open like a door?
315,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Too simple for the sight of faith, too huge for human eyes,"
316,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"What light upon what ancient way shines to a far-off floor,"
317,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,The line of the lost land of France or the plains of Paradise?
318,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,

327,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,"Like a walking tower of brass,"

329,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And the songs ceased and the slaves were dumb;
330,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And far towards the foam
331,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,Men saw a shadow on the sands;
332,THE BALLAD OF ST. BARBARA,And her father coming home....

445,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,Mix a mad twilight of the moon and sun;

454,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,And shakes to think that all the world has wings.
455,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,When the one head that turns the heavens in turning
456,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,"Moves yet as lightly as a lingering bird,"
457,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,"And red and random, blown astray but burning,"

463,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,And what far cry of frontiers and what fire
464,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,"Fallen too far beyond the sun for seeking,"

473,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,"One with the stars, a god with myriad eyes,"
474,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,I saw you nowhere and was blind for scorn:
475,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,One till the world was riven and the rise
476,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,Of the white days when you and I were born.
477,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,

490,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,Even in the symbol of the crossing swords.
491,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,Nor shall death doubt Who made our souls alive
492,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,"Swords meeting and not stakes set side by side,"
493,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,Bade us in the sunburst and the thunder thrive
494,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,Earthquake and Dawn; the bridegroom and the bride.
495,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,
496,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,"Death and not dreams or doubt of things undying,"
497,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,Of whose the holy hearth or whose the sword;
498,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,Though sacred spirits dissever in strong crying
499,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,"Into Thy hands, but Thy two hands, O Lord,"
500,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,Though not in Earth as once in Eden standing
501,A WEDDING IN WAR-TIME,"So plain again we see Thee what thou art,"

567,THE OLD SONG,And I knew the end was near:
568,THE OLD SONG,"And something said that far away, over the hills and far away,"
569,THE OLD SONG,There came a crawling thunder and the end of all things here.
570,THE OLD SONG,"For London Bridge is broken down, broken down, broken down,"
571,THE OLD SONG,"As digging lets the daylight on the sunken streets of yore,"
572,THE OLD SONG,"The lightning looked on London town, the broken bridge of London town,"

719,ON THE DOWNS,And the roar of the burghers' bell:
720,ON THE DOWNS,Beacons crackled and bolts were hurled
721,ON THE DOWNS,As you came over the top of the world;

723,ON THE DOWNS,And the slime of the slopes of hell.
724,ON THE DOWNS,
725,ON THE DOWNS,It has not been as the great wind spoke
726,ON THE DOWNS,On the great green down that day:

899,NIGHTMARE,Spotted with stars and smooth with silence sprang;
900,NIGHTMARE,"And though three doors stood open, the end of light"
901,NIGHTMARE,Closed like a trap; and stillness was a clang.
902,NIGHTMARE,
903,NIGHTMARE,Under the leopard sky of lurid stars
904,NIGHTMARE,"I strove with evil sleep the hot night long,"
905,NIGHTMARE,"Dreams dumb and swollen of triumphs without wars,"
906,NIGHTMARE,Of tongueless trumpet and unanswering gong.
907,NIGHTMARE,
908,NIGHTMARE,"I saw a pale imperial pomp go by,"
909,NIGHTMARE,Helmet and hornèd mitre and heavy wreath;
910,NIGHTMARE,Their high strange ensigns hung upon the sky
911,NIGHTMARE,And their great shields were like the doors of death.
912,NIGHTMARE,
913,NIGHTMARE,Their mitres were as moving pyramids
914,NIGHTMARE,And all their crowns as marching towers were tall;
915,NIGHTMARE,Their eyes were cold under their carven lids
916,NIGHTMARE,And the same carven smile was on them all.
917,NIGHTMARE,
918,NIGHTMARE,Over a paven plain that seemed unending
919,NIGHTMARE,They passed unfaltering till it found an end
920,NIGHTMARE,In one long shallow step; and these descending
921,NIGHTMARE,Fared forth anew as long away to wend.
922,NIGHTMARE,
923,NIGHTMARE,I thought they travelled for a thousand years;
924,NIGHTMARE,"And at the end was nothing for them all,"
925,NIGHTMARE,"For all that splendour of sceptres and of spears,"
926,NIGHTMARE,"But a new step, another easy fall."
927,NIGHTMARE,
928,NIGHTMARE,"The smile of stone seemed but a little less,"
929,NIGHTMARE,The load of silver but a little more:
930,NIGHTMARE,And ever was that terraced wilderness
931,NIGHTMARE,And falling plain paved like a palace floor.
932,NIGHTMARE,
933,NIGHTMARE,Rust red as gore crawled on their arms of might
934,NIGHTMARE,And on their faces wrinkles and not scars:
935,NIGHTMARE,Till the dream suddenly ended; noise and light
936,NIGHTMARE,Loosened the tyranny of the tropic stars.
937,NIGHTMARE,
938,NIGHTMARE,But over them like a subterranean sun
939,NIGHTMARE,I saw the sign of all the fiends that fell;
940,NIGHTMARE,"And a wild voice cried ""Hasten and be done,"
941,NIGHTMARE,"Is there no steepness in the stairs of hell?"""

959,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Or a tall tree and a swing.

991,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Or shake the dust from off my feet
992,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Or the staff that bears me through
993,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,"On ground that is too good to last,"
994,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Too solid to be true.
995,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,
996,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,"Men grow too old to woo, my love,"
997,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Men grow too old to wed:
998,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,But I shall not grow too old to see
999,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Hung crazily overhead
1000,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Incredible rafters when I wake
1001,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,And find I am not dead.
1002,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,
1003,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,A thrill of thunder in my hair:
1004,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,"Though blackening clouds be plain,"
1005,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Still I am stung and startled
1006,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,By the first drop of the rain:
1007,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Romance and pride and passion pass
1008,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,And these are what remain.
1009,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,
1010,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,"Strange crawling carpets of the grass,"
1011,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Wide windows of the sky:
1012,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,So in this perilous grace of God
1013,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,With all my sins go I:
1014,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,"And things grow new though I grow old,"
1015,A SECOND CHILDHOOD,Though I grow old and die.
