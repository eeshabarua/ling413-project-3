30,PREFACE,"THIS poem, though new in the sense of being now for the first time"
31,PREFACE,"printed, was written some four years ago, about the same date as the"
32,PREFACE,_Hound of Heaven_ in my former volume.

34,PREFACE,One image in the _Proem_ was an unconscious plagiarism from the beautiful

38,PREFACE,"That flutter’st sudden ’neath the breast of Earth,"

43,PREFACE,a Poet rich enough to lend to the poor.

61,SISTER SONGS,
62,SISTER SONGS,
63,SISTER SONGS,The Proem
64,SISTER SONGS,
65,SISTER SONGS,
66,SISTER SONGS,SHREWD winds and shrill—were these the speech of May?
67,SISTER SONGS,"A ragged, slag-grey sky—invested so,"
68,SISTER SONGS,Mary’s spoilt nursling! wert thou wont to go?
69,SISTER SONGS,"Or _thou_, Sun-god and song-god, say"
70,SISTER SONGS,"Could singer pipe one tiniest linnet-lay,"
71,SISTER SONGS,While Song did turn away his face from song?
72,SISTER SONGS,Or who could be
73,SISTER SONGS,"In spirit or in body hale for long,—"
74,SISTER SONGS,Old Æsculap’s best Master!—lacking thee?
75,SISTER SONGS,"At length, then, thou art here!"
76,SISTER SONGS,On the earth’s lethèd ear
77,SISTER SONGS,"Thy voice of light rings out exultant, strong;"
78,SISTER SONGS,Through dreams she stirs and murmurs at that summons dear:
79,SISTER SONGS,"From its red leash my heart strains tamelessly,"
80,SISTER SONGS,For Spring leaps in the womb of the young year!
81,SISTER SONGS,"Nay, was it not brought forth before,"
82,SISTER SONGS,"And we waited, to behold it,"
83,SISTER SONGS,"Till the sun’s hand should unfold it,"
84,SISTER SONGS,What the year’s young bosom bore?
85,SISTER SONGS,"Even so; it came, nor knew we that it came,"
86,SISTER SONGS,In the sun’s eclipse.
87,SISTER SONGS,"Yet the birds have plighted vows,"
88,SISTER SONGS,And from the branches pipe each other’s name;
89,SISTER SONGS,Yet the season all the boughs
90,SISTER SONGS,"Has kindled to the finger-tips,—"
91,SISTER SONGS,"Mark yonder, how the long laburnum drips"
92,SISTER SONGS,"Its jocund spilth of fire, its honey of wild flame!"
93,SISTER SONGS,"Yea, and myself put on swift quickening,"
94,SISTER SONGS,And answer to the presence of a sudden Spring.
95,SISTER SONGS,From cloud-zoned pinnacles of the secret spirit
96,SISTER SONGS,Song falls precipitant in dizzying streams;
97,SISTER SONGS,"And, like a mountain-hold when war-shouts stir it,"
98,SISTER SONGS,The mind’s recessèd fastness casts to light
99,SISTER SONGS,"Its gleaming multitudes, that from every height"
100,SISTER SONGS,Unfurl the flaming of a thousand dreams.
101,SISTER SONGS,"Now therefore, thou who bring’st the year to birth,"
102,SISTER SONGS,Who guid’st the bare and dabbled feet of May;
103,SISTER SONGS,"Sweet stem to that rose Christ, who from the earth"
104,SISTER SONGS,"Suck’st our poor prayers, conveying them to Him;"
105,SISTER SONGS,"Be aidant, tender Lady, to my lay!"
106,SISTER SONGS,"Of thy two maidens somewhat must I say,"
107,SISTER SONGS,"Ere shadowy twilight lashes, drooping, dim"
108,SISTER SONGS,Day’s dreamy eyes from us;
109,SISTER SONGS,Ere eve has struck and furled
110,SISTER SONGS,"The beamy-textured tent transpicuous,"
111,SISTER SONGS,"Of webbèd coerule wrought and woven calms,"
112,SISTER SONGS,Whence has paced forth the lambent-footed sun.
113,SISTER SONGS,"And Thou disclose my flower of song upcurled,"
114,SISTER SONGS,Who from Thy fair irradiant palms
115,SISTER SONGS,Scatterest all love and loveliness as alms;
116,SISTER SONGS,"Yea, Holy One,"
117,SISTER SONGS,Who coin’st Thyself to beauty for the world!
118,SISTER SONGS,
119,SISTER SONGS,"_Then_, _Spring’s little children_, _your lauds do ye upraise_"
120,SISTER SONGS,"_To Sylvia_, _O Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_!"
121,SISTER SONGS,"_Your lovesome labours lay away_,"
122,SISTER SONGS,"_And trick you out in holiday_,"
123,SISTER SONGS,_For syllabling to Sylvia_;
124,SISTER SONGS,"_And all you birds on branches_, _lave your mouths with May_,"
125,SISTER SONGS,"_To bear with me this burthen_,"
126,SISTER SONGS,_For singing to Sylvia_.
127,SISTER SONGS,
128,SISTER SONGS,
129,SISTER SONGS,
130,SISTER SONGS,Part the First
131,SISTER SONGS,
132,SISTER SONGS,
133,SISTER SONGS,"THE leaves dance, the leaves sing,"
134,SISTER SONGS,The leaves dance in the breath of the Spring.
135,SISTER SONGS,"I bid them dance,"
136,SISTER SONGS,"I bid them sing,"
137,SISTER SONGS,For the limpid glance
138,SISTER SONGS,Of my ladyling;
139,SISTER SONGS,"For the gift to the Spring of a dewier spring,"
140,SISTER SONGS,For God’s good grace of this ladyling!
141,SISTER SONGS,"I know in the lane, by the hedgerow track,"
142,SISTER SONGS,"The long, broad grasses underneath"
143,SISTER SONGS,Are warted with rain like a toad’s knobbed back;
144,SISTER SONGS,But here May weareth a rainless wreath.
145,SISTER SONGS,In the new-sucked milk of the sun’s bosom
146,SISTER SONGS,Is dabbled the mouth of the daisy-blossom;
147,SISTER SONGS,The smouldering rosebud chars through its sheath;
148,SISTER SONGS,"The lily stirs her snowy limbs,"
149,SISTER SONGS,Ere she swims
150,SISTER SONGS,"Naked up through her cloven green,"
151,SISTER SONGS,Like the wave-born Lady of Love Hellene;
152,SISTER SONGS,And the scattered snowdrop exquisite
153,SISTER SONGS,"Twinkles and gleams,"
154,SISTER SONGS,As if the showers of the sunny beams
155,SISTER SONGS,Were splashed from the earth in drops of light.
156,SISTER SONGS,Everything
157,SISTER SONGS,That is child of Spring
158,SISTER SONGS,Casts its bud or blossoming
159,SISTER SONGS,Upon the stream of my delight.
160,SISTER SONGS,
161,SISTER SONGS,"_Their voices_, _that scents are_, _now let them upraise_"
162,SISTER SONGS,"_To Sylvia_, _O Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_!"
163,SISTER SONGS,"_Their lovely mother them array_,"
164,SISTER SONGS,"_And prank them out in holiday_,"
165,SISTER SONGS,_For syllabling to Sylvia_;
166,SISTER SONGS,"_And all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,"
167,SISTER SONGS,"_To bear with me this burthen_,"
168,SISTER SONGS,_For singing to Sylvia_.
169,SISTER SONGS,
170,SISTER SONGS,
171,SISTER SONGS,2.
172,SISTER SONGS,
173,SISTER SONGS,
174,SISTER SONGS,While thus I stood in mazes bound
175,SISTER SONGS,"Of vernal sorcery,"
176,SISTER SONGS,"I heard a dainty dubious sound,"
177,SISTER SONGS,As of goodly melody;
178,SISTER SONGS,"Which first was faint as if in swound,"
179,SISTER SONGS,Then burst so suddenly
180,SISTER SONGS,"In warring concord all around,"
181,SISTER SONGS,"That, whence this thing might be,"
182,SISTER SONGS,To see
183,SISTER SONGS,The very marrow longed in me!
184,SISTER SONGS,"It seemed of air, it seemed of ground,"
185,SISTER SONGS,And never any witchery
186,SISTER SONGS,"Drawn from pipe, or reed, or string,"
187,SISTER SONGS,Made such dulcet ravishing.
188,SISTER SONGS,"’Twas like no earthly instrument,"
189,SISTER SONGS,Yet had something of them all
190,SISTER SONGS,"In its rise, and in its fall;"
191,SISTER SONGS,As if in one sweet consort there were blent
192,SISTER SONGS,Those archetypes celestial
193,SISTER SONGS,Which our endeavouring instruments recall.
194,SISTER SONGS,So heavenly flutes made murmurous plain
195,SISTER SONGS,"To heavenly viols, that again"
196,SISTER SONGS,—Aching with music—wailed back pain;
197,SISTER SONGS,"Regals release their notes, which rise"
198,SISTER SONGS,"Welling, like tears from heart to eyes;"
199,SISTER SONGS,And the harp thrills with thronging sighs.
200,SISTER SONGS,Horns in mellow flattering
201,SISTER SONGS,Parley with the cithern-string:—
202,SISTER SONGS,"Hark!—the floating, long-drawn note"
203,SISTER SONGS,Woos the throbbing cithern-string!
204,SISTER SONGS,
205,SISTER SONGS,"_Their pretty_, _pretty prating those citherns sure upraise_"
206,SISTER SONGS,"_For homage unto Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_:"
207,SISTER SONGS,"_Those flutes do flute their vowelled lay_,"
208,SISTER SONGS,"_Their lovely languid language say_,"
209,SISTER SONGS,_For lisping to Sylvia_;
210,SISTER SONGS,"_Those viols’ lissom bowings break the heart of May_,"
211,SISTER SONGS,"_And harps harp their burthen_,"
212,SISTER SONGS,_For singing to Sylvia_.
213,SISTER SONGS,
214,SISTER SONGS,
215,SISTER SONGS,3.
216,SISTER SONGS,
217,SISTER SONGS,
218,SISTER SONGS,Now at that music and that mirth
219,SISTER SONGS,"Rose, as ’twere, veils from earth;"
220,SISTER SONGS,And I spied
221,SISTER SONGS,How beside
222,SISTER SONGS,"Bud, bell, bloom, an elf"
223,SISTER SONGS,"Stood, or was the flower itself"
224,SISTER SONGS,’Mid radiant air
225,SISTER SONGS,All the fair
226,SISTER SONGS,Frequence swayed in irised wavers.
227,SISTER SONGS,Some against the gleaming rims
228,SISTER SONGS,Their bosoms prest
229,SISTER SONGS,"Of the kingcups, to the brims"
230,SISTER SONGS,"Filled with sun, and their white limbs"
231,SISTER SONGS,Bathèd in those golden lavers;
232,SISTER SONGS,"Some on the brown, glowing breast"
233,SISTER SONGS,"Of that Indian maid, the pansy,"
234,SISTER SONGS,(Through its tenuous veils confest
235,SISTER SONGS,"Of swathing light), in a quaint fancy"
236,SISTER SONGS,Tied her knot of yellow favours;
237,SISTER SONGS,Others dared open draw
238,SISTER SONGS,Snapdragon’s dreadful jaw:
239,SISTER SONGS,"Some, just sprung from out the soil,"
240,SISTER SONGS,Sleeked and shook their rumpled fans
241,SISTER SONGS,Dropt with sheen
242,SISTER SONGS,Of moony green;
243,SISTER SONGS,"Others, not yet extricate,"
244,SISTER SONGS,"On their hands leaned their weight,"
245,SISTER SONGS,"And writhed them free with mickle toil,"
246,SISTER SONGS,Still folded in their veiny vans:
247,SISTER SONGS,And all with an unsought accord
248,SISTER SONGS,Sang together from the sward;
249,SISTER SONGS,"Whence had come, and from sprites"
250,SISTER SONGS,"Yet unseen, those delights,"
251,SISTER SONGS,"As of tempered musics blent,"
252,SISTER SONGS,Which had given me such content.
253,SISTER SONGS,"For haply our best instrument,"
254,SISTER SONGS,"Pipe or cithern, stopped or strung,"
255,SISTER SONGS,Mimics but some spirit tongue.
256,SISTER SONGS,
257,SISTER SONGS,"_Their amiable voices_, _I bid them upraise_"
258,SISTER SONGS,"_To Sylvia_, _O Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_;"
259,SISTER SONGS,"_Their lovesome labours laid away_,"
260,SISTER SONGS,_To linger out this holiday_
261,SISTER SONGS,_In syllabling to Sylvia_;
262,SISTER SONGS,"_While all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,"
263,SISTER SONGS,"_To bear with me this burthen_,"
264,SISTER SONGS,_For singing to Sylvia_.
265,SISTER SONGS,
266,SISTER SONGS,
267,SISTER SONGS,4.
268,SISTER SONGS,
269,SISTER SONGS,
270,SISTER SONGS,"Next I saw, wonder-whist,"
271,SISTER SONGS,"How from the atmosphere a mist,"
272,SISTER SONGS,"So it seemed, slow uprist;"
273,SISTER SONGS,"And, looking from those elfin swarms,"
274,SISTER SONGS,I was ’ware
275,SISTER SONGS,How the air
276,SISTER SONGS,Was all populous with forms
277,SISTER SONGS,"Of the Hours, floating down,"
278,SISTER SONGS,Like Nereids through a watery town.
279,SISTER SONGS,"Some, with languors of waved arms,"
280,SISTER SONGS,Fluctuous oared their flexile way;
281,SISTER SONGS,Some were borne half resupine
282,SISTER SONGS,"On the aërial hyaline,"
283,SISTER SONGS,Their fluid limbs and rare array
284,SISTER SONGS,"Flickering on the wind, as quivers"
285,SISTER SONGS,Trailing weed in running rivers;
286,SISTER SONGS,"And others, in far prospect seen,"
287,SISTER SONGS,"Newly loosed on this terrene,"
288,SISTER SONGS,"Shot in piercing swiftness came,"
289,SISTER SONGS,With hair a-stream like pale and goblin flame.
290,SISTER SONGS,"As crystálline ice in water,"
291,SISTER SONGS,Lay in air each faint daughter;
292,SISTER SONGS,Inseparate (or but separate dim)
293,SISTER SONGS,"Circumfused wind from wind-like vest,"
294,SISTER SONGS,Wind-like vest from wind-like limb.
295,SISTER SONGS,"But outward from each lucid breast,"
296,SISTER SONGS,"When some passion left its haunt,"
297,SISTER SONGS,"Radiate surge of colour came,"
298,SISTER SONGS,"Diffusing blush-wise, palpitant,"
299,SISTER SONGS,Dying all the filmy frame.
300,SISTER SONGS,With some sweet tenderness they would
301,SISTER SONGS,Turn to an amber-clear and glossy gold;
302,SISTER SONGS,"Or a fine sorrow, lovely to behold,"
303,SISTER SONGS,Would sweep them as the sun and wind’s joined flood
304,SISTER SONGS,Sweeps a greening-sapphire sea;
305,SISTER SONGS,Or they would glow enamouredly
306,SISTER SONGS,"Illustrious sanguine, like a grape of blood;"
307,SISTER SONGS,Or with mantling poetry
308,SISTER SONGS,"Curd to the tincture which the opal hath,"
309,SISTER SONGS,Like rainbows thawing in a moonbeam bath.
310,SISTER SONGS,"So paled they, flushed they, swam they, sang melodiously."
311,SISTER SONGS,
312,SISTER SONGS,"_Their chanting_, _soon fading_, _let them_, _too_, _upraise_"
313,SISTER SONGS,"_For homage unto Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_;"
314,SISTER SONGS,"_Weave with suave float their wavèd way_,"
315,SISTER SONGS,"_And colours take of holiday_,"
316,SISTER SONGS,_For syllabling to Sylvia_;
317,SISTER SONGS,"_And all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,"
318,SISTER SONGS,"_To bear with me this burthen_,"
319,SISTER SONGS,_For singing to Sylvia_.
320,SISTER SONGS,
321,SISTER SONGS,
322,SISTER SONGS,5.
323,SISTER SONGS,
324,SISTER SONGS,
325,SISTER SONGS,"Then, through those translucencies,"
326,SISTER SONGS,"As grew my senses clearer clear,"
327,SISTER SONGS,"Did I see, and did I hear,"
328,SISTER SONGS,How under an elm’s canopy
329,SISTER SONGS,Wheeled a flight of Dryades
330,SISTER SONGS,Murmuring measured melody.
331,SISTER SONGS,"Gyre in gyre their treading was,"
332,SISTER SONGS,"Wheeling with an adverse flight,"
333,SISTER SONGS,"In twi-circle o’er the grass,"
334,SISTER SONGS,"These to left, and those to right;"
335,SISTER SONGS,All the band
336,SISTER SONGS,Linkèd by each other’s hand;
337,SISTER SONGS,Decked in raiment stainèd as
338,SISTER SONGS,The blue-helmèd aconite.
339,SISTER SONGS,"And they advance with flutter, with grace,"
340,SISTER SONGS,To the dance
341,SISTER SONGS,"Moving on with a dainty pace,"
342,SISTER SONGS,As blossoms mince it on river swells.
343,SISTER SONGS,"Over their heads their cymbals shine,"
344,SISTER SONGS,Round each ankle gleams a twine
345,SISTER SONGS,Of twinkling bells—
346,SISTER SONGS,Tune twirled golden from their cells.
347,SISTER SONGS,"Every step was a tinkling sound,"
348,SISTER SONGS,"As they glanced in their dancing-ground,"
349,SISTER SONGS,Clouds in cluster with such a sailing
350,SISTER SONGS,"Float o’er the light of the wasting moon,"
351,SISTER SONGS,As the cloud of their gliding veiling
352,SISTER SONGS,Swung in the sway of the dancing-tune.
353,SISTER SONGS,"There was the clash of their cymbals clanging,"
354,SISTER SONGS,Ringing of swinging bells clinging their feet;
355,SISTER SONGS,"And the clang on wing it seemed a-hanging,"
356,SISTER SONGS,Hovering round their dancing so fleet.—
357,SISTER SONGS,"I stirred, I rustled more than meet;"
358,SISTER SONGS,"Whereat they broke to the left and right,"
359,SISTER SONGS,With eddying robes like aconite
360,SISTER SONGS,Blue of helm;
361,SISTER SONGS,And I beheld to the foot o’ the elm.
362,SISTER SONGS,
363,SISTER SONGS,"_They have not tripped those dances_, _betrayed to my gaze_,"
364,SISTER SONGS,"_To glad the heart of Sylvia_, _beholding of their maze_;"
365,SISTER SONGS,"_Through barky walls have slid away_,"
366,SISTER SONGS,"_And tricked them in their holiday_,"
367,SISTER SONGS,_For other than for Sylvia_;
368,SISTER SONGS,"_While all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,"
369,SISTER SONGS,"_And bear with me this burthen_,"
370,SISTER SONGS,_For singing to Sylvia_.
371,SISTER SONGS,
372,SISTER SONGS,
373,SISTER SONGS,6.
374,SISTER SONGS,
375,SISTER SONGS,
376,SISTER SONGS,"Where its umbrage was enrooted,"
377,SISTER SONGS,"Sat white-suited,"
378,SISTER SONGS,"Sat green-amiced, and bare-footed,"
379,SISTER SONGS,Spring amid her minstrelsy;
380,SISTER SONGS,"There she sat amid her ladies,"
381,SISTER SONGS,Where the shade is
382,SISTER SONGS,Sheen as Enna mead ere Hades’
383,SISTER SONGS,Gloom fell thwart Persephone.
384,SISTER SONGS,Dewy buds were interstrown
385,SISTER SONGS,"Through her tresses hanging down,"
386,SISTER SONGS,And her feet
387,SISTER SONGS,"Were most sweet,"
388,SISTER SONGS,"Tinged like sea-stars, rosied brown."
389,SISTER SONGS,A throng of children like to flowers were sown
390,SISTER SONGS,"About the grass beside, or clomb her knee:"
391,SISTER SONGS,I looked who were that favoured company.
392,SISTER SONGS,And one there stood
393,SISTER SONGS,Against the beamy flood
394,SISTER SONGS,"Of sinking day, which, pouring its abundance,"
395,SISTER SONGS,Sublimed the illuminous and volute redundance
396,SISTER SONGS,"Of locks that, half dissolving, floated round her face;"
397,SISTER SONGS,As see I might
398,SISTER SONGS,Far off a lily-cluster poised in sun
399,SISTER SONGS,Dispread its gracile curls of light
400,SISTER SONGS,I knew what chosen child was there in place!
401,SISTER SONGS,"I knew there might no brows be, save of one,"
402,SISTER SONGS,"With such Hesperian fulgence compassèd,"
403,SISTER SONGS,Which in her moving seemed to wheel about her head.
404,SISTER SONGS,
405,SISTER SONGS,"_O Spring’s little children_, _more loud your lauds upraise_,"
406,SISTER SONGS,"_For this is even Sylvia_, _with her sweet_, _feat ways_!"
407,SISTER SONGS,"_Your lovesome labours lay away_,"
408,SISTER SONGS,"_And prank you out in holiday_,"
409,SISTER SONGS,_For syllabling to Sylvia_;
410,SISTER SONGS,"_And all you birds on branches_, _lave your mouths with May_,"
411,SISTER SONGS,_To bear with me this burthen_
412,SISTER SONGS,_For singing to Sylvia_!
413,SISTER SONGS,
414,SISTER SONGS,
415,SISTER SONGS,7.
416,SISTER SONGS,
417,SISTER SONGS,
418,SISTER SONGS,"Spring, goddess, is it thou, desirèd long?"
419,SISTER SONGS,And art thou girded round with this young train?—
420,SISTER SONGS,"If ever I did do thee ease in song,"
421,SISTER SONGS,"Now of thy grace let me one meed obtain,"
422,SISTER SONGS,And list thou to one plain.
423,SISTER SONGS,"Oh, keep still in thy train"
424,SISTER SONGS,"After the years when others therefrom fade,"
425,SISTER SONGS,"This tiny, well-belovèd maid!"
426,SISTER SONGS,"To whom the gate of my heart’s fortalice,"
427,SISTER SONGS,"With all which in it is,"
428,SISTER SONGS,And the shy self who doth therein immew him
429,SISTER SONGS,"’Gainst what loud leagurers battailously woo him,"
430,SISTER SONGS,"I, bribèd traitor to him,"
431,SISTER SONGS,Set open for one kiss.
432,SISTER SONGS,
433,SISTER SONGS,"_Then suffer_, _Spring_, _thy children_, _that lauds they should"
434,SISTER SONGS,upraise_
435,SISTER SONGS,"_To Sylvia_, _this Sylvia_, _her sweet_, _feat ways_;"
436,SISTER SONGS,"_Their lovely labours lay away_,"
437,SISTER SONGS,"_And trick them out in holiday_,"
438,SISTER SONGS,_For syllabling to Sylvia_;
439,SISTER SONGS,"_And that all birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,"
440,SISTER SONGS,"_To bear with me this burthen_,"
441,SISTER SONGS,_For singing to Sylvia_.
442,SISTER SONGS,
443,SISTER SONGS,
444,SISTER SONGS,8.
445,SISTER SONGS,
446,SISTER SONGS,
447,SISTER SONGS,A kiss? for a child’s kiss?
448,SISTER SONGS,"Aye, goddess, even for this."
449,SISTER SONGS,"Once, bright Sylviola! in days not far,"
450,SISTER SONGS,Once—in that nightmare-time which still doth haunt
451,SISTER SONGS,"My dreams, a grim, unbidden visitant—"
452,SISTER SONGS,"Forlorn, and faint, and stark,"
453,SISTER SONGS,I had endured through watches of the dark
454,SISTER SONGS,"The abashless inquisition of each star,"
455,SISTER SONGS,"Yea, was the outcast mark"
456,SISTER SONGS,Of all those heavenly passers’ scrutiny;
457,SISTER SONGS,Stood bound and helplessly
458,SISTER SONGS,For Time to shoot his barbèd minutes at me;
459,SISTER SONGS,Suffered the trampling hoof of every hour
460,SISTER SONGS,In night’s slow-wheelèd car;
461,SISTER SONGS,Until the tardy dawn dragged me at length
462,SISTER SONGS,"From under those dread wheels; and, bled of strength,"
463,SISTER SONGS,I waited the inevitable last.
464,SISTER SONGS,Then there came past
465,SISTER SONGS,"A child; like thee, a spring-flower; but a flower"
466,SISTER SONGS,"Fallen from the budded coronal of Spring,"
467,SISTER SONGS,And through the city-streets blown withering.
468,SISTER SONGS,"She passed,—O brave, sad, lovingest, tender thing!—"
469,SISTER SONGS,"And of her own scant pittance did she give,"
470,SISTER SONGS,That I might eat and live:
471,SISTER SONGS,"Then fled, a swift and trackless fugitive."
472,SISTER SONGS,Therefore I kissed in thee
473,SISTER SONGS,"The heart of Childhood, so divine for me;"
474,SISTER SONGS,"And her, through what sore ways,"
475,SISTER SONGS,"And what unchildish days,"
476,SISTER SONGS,"Borne from me now, as then, a trackless fugitive."
477,SISTER SONGS,Therefore I kissed in thee
478,SISTER SONGS,"Her, child! and innocency,"
479,SISTER SONGS,"And spring, and all things that have gone from me,"
480,SISTER SONGS,And that shall never be;
481,SISTER SONGS,"All vanished hopes, and all most hopeless bliss,"
482,SISTER SONGS,Came with thee to my kiss.
483,SISTER SONGS,And ah! so long myself had strayed afar
484,SISTER SONGS,"From child, and woman, and the boon earth’s green,"
485,SISTER SONGS,And all wherewith life’s face is fair beseen;
486,SISTER SONGS,Journeying its journey bare
487,SISTER SONGS,"Five suns, except of the all-kissing sun"
488,SISTER SONGS,Unkissed of one;
489,SISTER SONGS,Almost I had forgot
490,SISTER SONGS,"The healing harms,"
491,SISTER SONGS,"And whitest witchery, a-lurk in that"
492,SISTER SONGS,Authentic cestus of two girdling arms:
493,SISTER SONGS,And I remembered not
494,SISTER SONGS,The subtle sanctities which dart
495,SISTER SONGS,"From childish lips’ unvalued precious brush,"
496,SISTER SONGS,Nor how it makes the sudden lilies push
497,SISTER SONGS,Between the loosening fibres of the heart.
498,SISTER SONGS,"Then, that thy little kiss"
499,SISTER SONGS,"Should be to me all this,"
500,SISTER SONGS,Let workaday wisdom blink sage lids thereat;
501,SISTER SONGS,"Which towers a flight three hedgerows high, poor bat!"
502,SISTER SONGS,And straightway charts me out the empyreal air.
503,SISTER SONGS,"Its chart I wing not by, its canon of worth"
504,SISTER SONGS,"Scorn not, nor reck though mine should breed it mirth:"
505,SISTER SONGS,"And howso thou and I may be disjoint,"
506,SISTER SONGS,Yet still my falcon spirit makes her point
507,SISTER SONGS,Over the covert where
508,SISTER SONGS,"Thou, sweetest quarry, hast put in from her!"
509,SISTER SONGS,
510,SISTER SONGS,"(_Soul_, _hush these sad numbers_, _too sad to upraise_"
511,SISTER SONGS,"_In hymning bright Sylvia_, _unlearn’d in such ways_!"
512,SISTER SONGS,"_Our mournful moods lay we away_,"
513,SISTER SONGS,"_And prank our thoughts in holiday_,"
514,SISTER SONGS,_For syllabling to Sylvia_;
515,SISTER SONGS,"_When all the birds on branches lave their mouths with May_,"
516,SISTER SONGS,"_To bear with us this burthen_,"
517,SISTER SONGS,_For singing to Sylvia_!)
518,SISTER SONGS,
519,SISTER SONGS,
520,SISTER SONGS,9.
521,SISTER SONGS,
522,SISTER SONGS,
523,SISTER SONGS,"Then thus Spring, bounteous lady, made reply:"
524,SISTER SONGS,"“O lover of me and all my progeny,"
525,SISTER SONGS,For grace to you
526,SISTER SONGS,I take her ever to my retinue.
527,SISTER SONGS,"Over thy form, dear child, alas! my art"
528,SISTER SONGS,Cannot prevail; but mine immortalising
529,SISTER SONGS,Touch I lay upon thy heart.
530,SISTER SONGS,Thy soul’s fair shape
531,SISTER SONGS,"In my unfading mantle’s green I drape,"
532,SISTER SONGS,And thy white mind shall rest by my devising
533,SISTER SONGS,A Gideon-fleece amid life’s dusty drouth.
534,SISTER SONGS,If Even burst yon globèd yellow grape
535,SISTER SONGS,(Which is the sun to mortals’ sealèd sight)
536,SISTER SONGS,Against her stainèd mouth;
537,SISTER SONGS,Or if white-handed light
538,SISTER SONGS,"Draw thee yet dripping from the quiet pools,"
539,SISTER SONGS,"Still lucencies and cools,"
540,SISTER SONGS,"Of sleep, which all night mirror constellate dreams;"
541,SISTER SONGS,"Like to the sign which led the Israelite,"
542,SISTER SONGS,"Thy soul, through day or dark,"
543,SISTER SONGS,A visible brightness on the chosen ark
544,SISTER SONGS,"Of thy sweet body and pure,"
545,SISTER SONGS,"Shall it assure,"
546,SISTER SONGS,"With auspice large and tutelary gleams,"
547,SISTER SONGS,"Appointed solemn courts, and covenanted streams.”"
548,SISTER SONGS,
549,SISTER SONGS,"_Cease_, _Spring’s little children_, _now cease your lauds to raise_;"
550,SISTER SONGS,"_That dream is past_, _and Sylvia_, _with her sweet_, _feat ways_."
551,SISTER SONGS,"_Our lovèd labour_, _laid away_,"
552,SISTER SONGS,"_Is smoothly ended_; _said our say_,"
553,SISTER SONGS,_Our syllable to Sylvia_.
554,SISTER SONGS,"_Make sweet_, _you birds on branches_! _make sweet your mouths with"
555,SISTER SONGS,May_!
556,SISTER SONGS,"_But borne is this burthen_,"
557,SISTER SONGS,_Sung unto Sylvia_.
558,SISTER SONGS,
559,SISTER SONGS,
560,SISTER SONGS,
561,SISTER SONGS,Part the Second
562,SISTER SONGS,
563,SISTER SONGS,
564,SISTER SONGS,"AND now, thou elder nursling of the nest;"
565,SISTER SONGS,Ere all the intertangled west
566,SISTER SONGS,Be one magnificence
567,SISTER SONGS,Of multitudinous blossoms that o’errun
568,SISTER SONGS,The flaming brazen bowl o’ the burnished sun
569,SISTER SONGS,"Which they do flower from,"
570,SISTER SONGS,How shall I ’stablish _thy_ memorial?
571,SISTER SONGS,"Nay, how or with what countenance shall I come"
572,SISTER SONGS,To plead in my defence
573,SISTER SONGS,For loving thee at all?
574,SISTER SONGS,"I who can scarcely speak my fellows’ speech,"
575,SISTER SONGS,"Love their love, or mine own love to them teach;"
576,SISTER SONGS,"A bastard barred from their inheritance,"
577,SISTER SONGS,"Who seem, in this dim shape’s uneasy nook,"
578,SISTER SONGS,Some sun-flower’s spirit which by luckless chance
579,SISTER SONGS,Has mournfully its tenement mistook;
580,SISTER SONGS,"When it were better in its right abode,"
581,SISTER SONGS,Heartless and happy lackeying its god.
582,SISTER SONGS,"How com’st thou, little tender thing of white,"
583,SISTER SONGS,"Whose very touch full scantly me beseems,"
584,SISTER SONGS,"How com’st thou resting on my vaporous dreams,"
585,SISTER SONGS,Kindling a wraith there of earth’s vernal green?
586,SISTER SONGS,"Even so as I have seen,"
587,SISTER SONGS,"In night’s aërial sea with no wind blust’rous,"
588,SISTER SONGS,A ribbèd tract of cloudy malachite
589,SISTER SONGS,Curve a shored crescent wide;
590,SISTER SONGS,And on its slope marge shelving to the night
591,SISTER SONGS,The stranded moon lay quivering like a lustrous
592,SISTER SONGS,"Medusa newly washed up from the tide,"
593,SISTER SONGS,Lay in an oozy pool of its own deliquious light.
594,SISTER SONGS,
595,SISTER SONGS,"Yet hear how my excuses may prevail,"
596,SISTER SONGS,"Nor, tender white orb, be thou opposite!"
597,SISTER SONGS,Life and life’s beauty only hold their revels
598,SISTER SONGS,In the abysmal ocean’s luminous levels.
599,SISTER SONGS,"There, like the phantasms of a poet pale,"
600,SISTER SONGS,The exquisite marvels sail:
601,SISTER SONGS,Clarified silver; greens and azures frail
602,SISTER SONGS,"As if the colours sighed themselves away,"
603,SISTER SONGS,And blent in supersubtile interplay
604,SISTER SONGS,As if they swooned into each other’s arms;
605,SISTER SONGS,"Repured vermilion,"
606,SISTER SONGS,Like ear-tips ’gainst the sun;
607,SISTER SONGS,"And beings that, under night’s swart pinion,"
608,SISTER SONGS,Make every wave upon the harbour-bars
609,SISTER SONGS,A beaten yolk of stars.
610,SISTER SONGS,"But where day’s glance turns baffled from the deeps,"
611,SISTER SONGS,Die out those lovely swarms;
612,SISTER SONGS,And in the immense profound no creature glides or creeps.
613,SISTER SONGS,
614,SISTER SONGS,Love and love’s beauty only hold their revels
615,SISTER SONGS,"In life’s familiar, penetrable levels:"
616,SISTER SONGS,What of its ocean-floor?
617,SISTER SONGS,I dwell there evermore.
618,SISTER SONGS,From almost earliest youth
619,SISTER SONGS,"I raised the lids o’ the truth,"
620,SISTER SONGS,And forced her bend on me her shrinking sight;
621,SISTER SONGS,"Ever I knew me Beauty’s eremite,"
622,SISTER SONGS,In antre of this lowly body set.
623,SISTER SONGS,Girt with a thirsty solitude of soul.
624,SISTER SONGS,Nathless I not forget
625,SISTER SONGS,"How I have, even as the anchorite,"
626,SISTER SONGS,"I too, imperishing essences that console."
627,SISTER SONGS,"Under my ruined passions, fallen and sere,"
628,SISTER SONGS,"The wild dreams stir like little radiant girls,"
629,SISTER SONGS,Whom in the moulted plumage of the year
630,SISTER SONGS,Their comrades sweet have buried to the curls.
631,SISTER SONGS,"Yet, though their dedicated amorist,"
632,SISTER SONGS,"How often do I bid my visions hist,"
633,SISTER SONGS,"Deaf to them, pleading all their piteous fills;"
634,SISTER SONGS,"Who weep, as weep the maidens of the mist"
635,SISTER SONGS,Clinging the necks of the unheeding hills:
636,SISTER SONGS,"And their tears wash them lovelier than before,"
637,SISTER SONGS,"That from grief’s self our sad delight grows more,"
638,SISTER SONGS,"Fair are the soul’s uncrispèd calms, indeed,"
639,SISTER SONGS,Endiapered with many a spiritual form
640,SISTER SONGS,Of blosmy-tinctured weed;
641,SISTER SONGS,But scarce itself is conscious of the store
642,SISTER SONGS,"Suckled by it, and only after storm"
643,SISTER SONGS,Casts up its loosened thoughts upon the shore.
644,SISTER SONGS,To this end my deeps are stirred;
645,SISTER SONGS,And I deem well why life unshared
646,SISTER SONGS,Was ordainèd me of yore.
647,SISTER SONGS,"In pairing-time, we know, the bird"
648,SISTER SONGS,"Kindles to its deepmost splendour,"
649,SISTER SONGS,And the tender
650,SISTER SONGS,Voice is tenderest in its throat;
651,SISTER SONGS,"Were its love, for ever nigh it,"
652,SISTER SONGS,"Never by it,"
653,SISTER SONGS,"It might keep a vernal note,"
654,SISTER SONGS,The crocean and amethystine
655,SISTER SONGS,In their pristine
656,SISTER SONGS,Lustre linger on its coat.
657,SISTER SONGS,"Therefore must my song-bower lone be,"
658,SISTER SONGS,That my tone be
659,SISTER SONGS,Fresh with dewy pain alway;
660,SISTER SONGS,"She, who scorns my dearest care ta’en,"
661,SISTER SONGS,An uncertain
662,SISTER SONGS,Shadow of the sprite of May.
663,SISTER SONGS,"And is my song sweet, as they say?"
664,SISTER SONGS,"’Tis sweet for one whose voice has no reply,"
665,SISTER SONGS,Save silence’s sad cry:
666,SISTER SONGS,And are its plumes a burning bright array?
667,SISTER SONGS,They burn for an unincarnated eye
668,SISTER SONGS,"A bubble, charioteered by the inward breath"
669,SISTER SONGS,"Which, ardorous for its own invisible lure,"
670,SISTER SONGS,"Urges me glittering to aërial death,"
671,SISTER SONGS,I am rapt towards that bodiless paramour;
672,SISTER SONGS,Blindly the uncomprehended tyranny
673,SISTER SONGS,Obeying of my heart’s impetuous might.
674,SISTER SONGS,"The earth and all its planetary kin,"
675,SISTER SONGS,Starry buds tangled in the whirling hair
676,SISTER SONGS,"That flames round the Phoebean wassailer,"
677,SISTER SONGS,"Speed no more ignorant, more predestined flight,"
678,SISTER SONGS,"Than I, _her_ viewless tresses netted in."
679,SISTER SONGS,"As some most beautiful one, with lovely taunting,"
680,SISTER SONGS,"Her eyes of guileless guile o’ercanopies,"
681,SISTER SONGS,"Does her hid visage bow,"
682,SISTER SONGS,"And miserly your covetous gaze allow,"
683,SISTER SONGS,"By inchmeal, coy degrees,"
684,SISTER SONGS,Saying—“Can you see me now?”
685,SISTER SONGS,Yet from the mouth’s reflex you guess the wanting
686,SISTER SONGS,Smile of the coming eyes
687,SISTER SONGS,"In all their upturned grievous witcheries,"
688,SISTER SONGS,Before that sunbreak rise;
689,SISTER SONGS,And each still hidden feature view within
690,SISTER SONGS,"Your mind, as eager scrutinies detail"
691,SISTER SONGS,The moon’s young rondure through the shamefast veil
692,SISTER SONGS,Drawn to her gleaming chin:
693,SISTER SONGS,"After this wise,"
694,SISTER SONGS,From the enticing smile of earth and skies
695,SISTER SONGS,I dream my unknown Fair’s refusèd gaze;
696,SISTER SONGS,"And guessingly her love’s close traits devise,"
697,SISTER SONGS,Which she with subtile coquetries
698,SISTER SONGS,"Through little human glimpses slow displays,"
699,SISTER SONGS,Cozening my mateless days
700,SISTER SONGS,"By sick, intolerable delays."
701,SISTER SONGS,And so I keep mine uncompanioned ways;
702,SISTER SONGS,"And so my touch, to golden poesies"
703,SISTER SONGS,"Turning love’s bread, is bought at hunger’s price."
704,SISTER SONGS,"So,—in the inextinguishable wars"
705,SISTER SONGS,Which roll song’s Orient on the sullen night
706,SISTER SONGS,Whose ragged banners in their own despite
707,SISTER SONGS,"Take on the tinges of the hated light,—"
708,SISTER SONGS,So Sultan Phoebus has his Janizars.
709,SISTER SONGS,But if mine unappeasèd cicatrices
710,SISTER SONGS,Might get them lawful ease;
711,SISTER SONGS,"Were any gentle passion hallowed me,"
712,SISTER SONGS,Who must none other breath of passion feel
713,SISTER SONGS,Save such as winnows to the fledgèd heel
714,SISTER SONGS,The tremulous Paradisal plumages;
715,SISTER SONGS,The conscious sacramental trees
716,SISTER SONGS,Which ever be
717,SISTER SONGS,"Shaken celestially,"
718,SISTER SONGS,"Consentient with enamoured wings, might know my love for thee."
719,SISTER SONGS,"Yet is there more, whereat none guesseth, love!"
720,SISTER SONGS,Upon the ending of my deadly night
721,SISTER SONGS,"(Whereof thou hast not the surmise, and slight"
722,SISTER SONGS,"Is all that any mortal knows thereof),"
723,SISTER SONGS,"Thou wert to me that earnest of day’s light,"
724,SISTER SONGS,"When, like the back of a gold-mailèd saurian"
725,SISTER SONGS,"Heaving its slow length from Nilotic slime,"
726,SISTER SONGS,The first long gleaming fissure runs Aurorian
727,SISTER SONGS,Athwart the yet dun firmament of prime.
728,SISTER SONGS,Stretched on the margin of the cruel sea
729,SISTER SONGS,"Whence they had rescued me,"
730,SISTER SONGS,With faint and painful pulses was I lying;
731,SISTER SONGS,Not yet discerning well
732,SISTER SONGS,"If I had ’scaped, or were an icicle,"
733,SISTER SONGS,Whose thawing is its dying.
734,SISTER SONGS,"Like one who sweats before a despot’s gate,"
735,SISTER SONGS,"Summoned by some presaging scroll of fate,"
736,SISTER SONGS,And knows not whether kiss or dagger wait;
737,SISTER SONGS,"And all so sickened is his countenance,"
738,SISTER SONGS,"The courtiers buzz, “Lo, doomed!” and look at him askance:—"
739,SISTER SONGS,At Fate’s dread portal then
740,SISTER SONGS,"Even so stood I, I ken,"
741,SISTER SONGS,"Even so stood I, between a joy and fear,"
742,SISTER SONGS,"And said to mine own heart, “Now if the end be here!”"
743,SISTER SONGS,
744,SISTER SONGS,"They say, Earth’s beauty seems completest"
745,SISTER SONGS,To them that on their death-beds rest;
746,SISTER SONGS,Gentle lady! she smiles sweetest
747,SISTER SONGS,Just ere she clasp us to her breast.
748,SISTER SONGS,"And I,—now _my_ Earth’s countenance grew bright,"
749,SISTER SONGS,Did she but smile me towards that nuptial-night?
750,SISTER SONGS,"But whileas on such dubious bed I lay,"
751,SISTER SONGS,"One unforgotten day,"
752,SISTER SONGS,As a sick child waking sees
753,SISTER SONGS,Wide-eyed daisies
754,SISTER SONGS,"Gazing on it from its hand,"
755,SISTER SONGS,Slipped there for its dear amazes;
756,SISTER SONGS,So between thy father’s knees
757,SISTER SONGS,"I saw _thee_ stand,"
758,SISTER SONGS,And through my hazes
759,SISTER SONGS,Of pain and fear thine eyes’ young wonder shone.
760,SISTER SONGS,"Then, as flies scatter from a carrion,"
761,SISTER SONGS,Or rooks in spreading gyres like broken smoke
762,SISTER SONGS,"Wheel, when some sound their quietude has broke,"
763,SISTER SONGS,"Fled, at thy countenance, all that doubting spawn:"
764,SISTER SONGS,"The heart which I had questioned spoke,"
765,SISTER SONGS,"A cry impetuous from its depths was drawn,—"
766,SISTER SONGS,“I take the omen of this face of dawn!”
767,SISTER SONGS,And with the omen to my heart cam’st thou.
768,SISTER SONGS,Even with a spray of tears
769,SISTER SONGS,That one light draft was fixed there for the years.
770,SISTER SONGS,
771,SISTER SONGS,And now?—
772,SISTER SONGS,"The hours I tread ooze memories of thee, Sweet!"
773,SISTER SONGS,Beneath my casual feet.
774,SISTER SONGS,"With rainfall as the lea,"
775,SISTER SONGS,The day is drenched with thee;
776,SISTER SONGS,In little exquisite surprises
777,SISTER SONGS,Bubbling deliciousness of thee arises
778,SISTER SONGS,"From sudden places,"
779,SISTER SONGS,Under the common traces
780,SISTER SONGS,Of my most lethargied and customed paces.
781,SISTER SONGS,
782,SISTER SONGS,As an Arab journeyeth
783,SISTER SONGS,"Through a sand of Ayaman,"
784,SISTER SONGS,"Lean Thirst, lolling its cracked tongue,"
785,SISTER SONGS,Lagging by his side along;
786,SISTER SONGS,And a rusty-wingèd Death
787,SISTER SONGS,"Grating its low flight before,"
788,SISTER SONGS,Casting ribbèd shadows o’er
789,SISTER SONGS,"The blank desert, blank and tan:"
790,SISTER SONGS,He lifts by hap toward where the morning’s roots are
791,SISTER SONGS,"His weary stare,—"
792,SISTER SONGS,"Sees, although they plashless mutes are,"
793,SISTER SONGS,Set in a silver air
794,SISTER SONGS,"Fountains of gelid shoots are,"
795,SISTER SONGS,Making the daylight fairest fair;
796,SISTER SONGS,Sees the palm and tamarind
797,SISTER SONGS,Tangle the tresses of a phantom wind;—
798,SISTER SONGS,A sight like innocence when one has sinned!
799,SISTER SONGS,"A green and maiden freshness smiling there,"
800,SISTER SONGS,While with unblinking glare
801,SISTER SONGS,The tawny-hided desert crouches watching her.
802,SISTER SONGS,
803,SISTER SONGS,’Tis a vision:
804,SISTER SONGS,Yet the greeneries Elysian
805,SISTER SONGS,He has known in tracts afar;
806,SISTER SONGS,"Thus the enamouring fountains flow,"
807,SISTER SONGS,"Those the very palms that grow,"
808,SISTER SONGS,"By rare-gummed Sava, or Herbalimar.—"
809,SISTER SONGS,
810,SISTER SONGS,Such a watered dream has tarried
811,SISTER SONGS,Trembling on my desert arid;
812,SISTER SONGS,Even so
813,SISTER SONGS,Its lovely gleamings
814,SISTER SONGS,Seemings show
815,SISTER SONGS,Of things not seemings;
816,SISTER SONGS,"And I gaze,"
817,SISTER SONGS,"Knowing that, beyond my ways,"
818,SISTER SONGS,Verily
819,SISTER SONGS,"All these _are_, for these are she."
820,SISTER SONGS,Eve no gentlier lays her cooling cheek
821,SISTER SONGS,"On the burning brow of the sick earth,"
822,SISTER SONGS,"Sick with death, and sick with birth,"
823,SISTER SONGS,"Aeon to aeon, in secular fever twirled,"
824,SISTER SONGS,Than thy shadow soothes this weak
825,SISTER SONGS,And distempered being of mine.
826,SISTER SONGS,"In all I work, my hand includeth thine;"
827,SISTER SONGS,Thou rushest down in every stream
828,SISTER SONGS,Whose passion frets my spirit’s deepening gorge;
829,SISTER SONGS,"Unhood’st mine eyas-heart, and fliest my dream;"
830,SISTER SONGS,Thou swing’st the hammers of my forge;
831,SISTER SONGS,"As the innocent moon, that nothing does but shine,"
832,SISTER SONGS,Moves all the labouring surges of the world.
833,SISTER SONGS,"Pierce where thou wilt the springing thought in me,"
834,SISTER SONGS,"And there thy pictured countenance lies enfurled,"
835,SISTER SONGS,As in the cut fern lies the imaged tree.
836,SISTER SONGS,"This poor song that sings of thee,"
837,SISTER SONGS,"This fragile song, is but a curled"
838,SISTER SONGS,"Shell outgathered from thy sea,"
839,SISTER SONGS,And murmurous still of its nativity.
840,SISTER SONGS,Princess of Smiles!
841,SISTER SONGS,Sorceress of most unlawful-lawful wiles!
842,SISTER SONGS,"Cunning pit for gazers’ senses,"
843,SISTER SONGS,Overstrewn with innocences!
844,SISTER SONGS,Purities gleam white like statues
845,SISTER SONGS,"In the fair lakes of thine eyes,"
846,SISTER SONGS,And I watch the sparkles that use
847,SISTER SONGS,"There to rise,"
848,SISTER SONGS,Knowing these
849,SISTER SONGS,Are bubbles from the calyces
850,SISTER SONGS,Of the lovely thoughts that breathe
851,SISTER SONGS,"Paving, like water-flowers, thy spirit’s floor beneath."
852,SISTER SONGS,
853,SISTER SONGS,O thou most dear!
854,SISTER SONGS,Who art thy sex’s complex harmony
855,SISTER SONGS,God-set more facilely;
856,SISTER SONGS,To thee may love draw near
857,SISTER SONGS,"Without one blame or fear,"
858,SISTER SONGS,Unchidden save by his humility:
859,SISTER SONGS,Thou Perseus’ Shield! wherein I view secure
860,SISTER SONGS,The mirrored Woman’s fateful-fair allure!
861,SISTER SONGS,"Whom Heaven still leaves a twofold dignity,"
862,SISTER SONGS,"As girlhood gentle, and as boyhood free;"
863,SISTER SONGS,With whom no most diaphanous webs enwind
864,SISTER SONGS,The barèd limbs of the rebukeless mind.
865,SISTER SONGS,"Wild Dryad! all unconscious of thy tree,"
866,SISTER SONGS,With which indissolubly
867,SISTER SONGS,The tyrannous time shall one day make thee whole;
868,SISTER SONGS,Whose frank arms pass unfretted through its bole:
869,SISTER SONGS,Who wear’st thy femineity
870,SISTER SONGS,"Light as entrailèd blossoms, that shalt find"
871,SISTER SONGS,It erelong silver shackles unto thee.
872,SISTER SONGS,Thou whose young sex is yet but in thy soul;—
873,SISTER SONGS,As hoarded in the vine
874,SISTER SONGS,"Hang the gold skins of undelirious wine,"
875,SISTER SONGS,"As air sleeps, till it toss its limbs in breeze:—"
876,SISTER SONGS,"In whom the mystery which lures and sunders,"
877,SISTER SONGS,"Grapples and thrusts apart; endears, estranges;"
878,SISTER SONGS,—The dragon to its own Hesperides—
879,SISTER SONGS,"Is gated under slow-revolving changes,"
880,SISTER SONGS,Manifold doors of heavy-hingèd years.
881,SISTER SONGS,"So once, ere Heaven’s eyes were filled with wonders"
882,SISTER SONGS,"To see Laughter rise from Tears,"
883,SISTER SONGS,"Lay in beauty not yet mighty,"
884,SISTER SONGS,"Conchèd in translucencies,"
885,SISTER SONGS,"The antenatal Aphrodite,"
886,SISTER SONGS,Caved magically under magic seas;
887,SISTER SONGS,Caved dreamlessly beneath the dreamful seas.
888,SISTER SONGS,
889,SISTER SONGS,“Whose sex is in thy soul!”
890,SISTER SONGS,What think we of thy soul?
891,SISTER SONGS,"Which has no parts, and cannot grow,"
892,SISTER SONGS,Unfurled not from an embryo;
893,SISTER SONGS,"Born of full stature, lineal to control;"
894,SISTER SONGS,And yet a pigmy’s yoke must undergo.
895,SISTER SONGS,"Yet must keep pace and tarry, patient, kind,"
896,SISTER SONGS,"With its unwilling scholar, the dull, tardy mind;"
897,SISTER SONGS,"Must be obsequious to the body’s powers,"
898,SISTER SONGS,"Whose low hands mete its paths, set ope and close its ways;"
899,SISTER SONGS,"Must do obeisance to the days,"
900,SISTER SONGS,And wait the little pleasure of the hours;
901,SISTER SONGS,"Yea, ripe for kingship, yet must be"
902,SISTER SONGS,Captive in statuted minority!
903,SISTER SONGS,"So is all power fulfilled, as soul in thee."
904,SISTER SONGS,"So still the ruler by the ruled takes rule,"
905,SISTER SONGS,And wisdom weaves itself i’ the loom o’ the fool.
906,SISTER SONGS,"The splendent sun no splendour can display,"
907,SISTER SONGS,"Till on gross things he dash his broken ray,"
908,SISTER SONGS,From cloud and tree and flower re-tossed in prismy spray.
909,SISTER SONGS,"Did not obstruction’s vessel hem it in,"
910,SISTER SONGS,"Force were not force, would spill itself in vain"
911,SISTER SONGS,We know the Titan by his champèd chain.
912,SISTER SONGS,"Stay is heat’s cradle, it is rocked therein,"
913,SISTER SONGS,And by check’s hand is burnished into light;
914,SISTER SONGS,"If hate were none, would love burn lowlier bright?"
915,SISTER SONGS,God’s Fair were guessed scarce but for opposite sin;
916,SISTER SONGS,"Yea, and His Mercy, I do think it well,"
917,SISTER SONGS,Is flashed back from the brazen gates of Hell.
918,SISTER SONGS,The heavens decree
919,SISTER SONGS,All power fulfil itself as soul in thee.
920,SISTER SONGS,"For supreme Spirit subject was to clay,"
921,SISTER SONGS,"And Law from its own servants learned a law,"
922,SISTER SONGS,"And Light besought a lamp unto its way,"
923,SISTER SONGS,"And Awe was reined in awe,"
924,SISTER SONGS,At one small house of Nazareth;
925,SISTER SONGS,And Golgotha
926,SISTER SONGS,"Saw Breath to breathlessness resign its breath,"
927,SISTER SONGS,And Life do homage for its crown to death.
928,SISTER SONGS,
929,SISTER SONGS,"So is all power, as soul in thee increased!"
930,SISTER SONGS,"But, knowing this, in knowledge’s despite"
931,SISTER SONGS,I fret against the law severe that stains
932,SISTER SONGS,Thy spirit with eclipse;
933,SISTER SONGS,"When—as a nymph’s carven head sweet water drips,"
934,SISTER SONGS,For others oozing so the cool delight
935,SISTER SONGS,Which cannot steep her stiffened mouth of stone—
936,SISTER SONGS,Thy nescient lips repeat maternal strains.
937,SISTER SONGS,Memnonian lips!
938,SISTER SONGS,"Smitten with singing from thy mother’s east,"
939,SISTER SONGS,And murmurous with music not their own:
940,SISTER SONGS,"Nay, the lips flexile, while the mind alone"
941,SISTER SONGS,A passionless statue stands.
942,SISTER SONGS,"Oh, pardon, innocent one!"
943,SISTER SONGS,Pardon at thine unconscious hands!
944,SISTER SONGS,"“Murmurous with music not their own,” I say?"
945,SISTER SONGS,"And in that saying how do I missay,"
946,SISTER SONGS,When from the common sands
947,SISTER SONGS,Of poorest common speech of common day
948,SISTER SONGS,Thine accents sift the golden musics out!
949,SISTER SONGS,"And ah, we poets, I misdoubt,"
950,SISTER SONGS,Are little more than thou!
951,SISTER SONGS,"We speak a lesson taught we know not how,"
952,SISTER SONGS,And what it is that from us flows
953,SISTER SONGS,The hearer better than the utterer knows.
954,SISTER SONGS,
955,SISTER SONGS,Thou canst foreshape thy word;
956,SISTER SONGS,The poet is not lord
957,SISTER SONGS,Of the next syllable may come
958,SISTER SONGS,With the returning pendulum;
959,SISTER SONGS,"And what he plans to-day in song,"
960,SISTER SONGS,To-morrow sings it in another tongue.
961,SISTER SONGS,"Where the last leaf fell from his bough,"
962,SISTER SONGS,"He knows not if a leaf shall grow,"
963,SISTER SONGS,"Where he sows he doth not reap,"
964,SISTER SONGS,He reapeth where he did not sow;
965,SISTER SONGS,"He sleeps, and dreams forsake his sleep"
966,SISTER SONGS,To meet him on his waking way.
967,SISTER SONGS,Vision will mate him not by law and vow:
968,SISTER SONGS,"Disguised in life’s most hodden-grey,"
969,SISTER SONGS,By the most beaten road of everyday
970,SISTER SONGS,"She waits him, unsuspected and unknown."
971,SISTER SONGS,The hardest pang whereon
972,SISTER SONGS,He lays his mutinous head may be a Jacob’s stone.
973,SISTER SONGS,In the most iron crag his foot can tread
974,SISTER SONGS,"A Dream may strew her bed,"
975,SISTER SONGS,"And suddenly his limbs entwine,"
976,SISTER SONGS,And draw him down through rock as sea-nymphs might through brine.
977,SISTER SONGS,"But, unlike those feigned temptress-ladies who"
978,SISTER SONGS,"In guerdon of a night the lover slew,"
979,SISTER SONGS,"When the embrace has failed, the rapture fled,"
980,SISTER SONGS,"Not he, not he, the wild sweet witch is dead!"
981,SISTER SONGS,"And, though he cherisheth"
982,SISTER SONGS,"The babe most strangely born from out her death,"
983,SISTER SONGS,"Some tender trick of her it hath, maybe,—"
984,SISTER SONGS,It is not she!
985,SISTER SONGS,
986,SISTER SONGS,"Yet, even as the air is rumorous of fray"
987,SISTER SONGS,Before the first shafts of the sun’s onslaught
988,SISTER SONGS,"From gloom’s black harness splinter,"
989,SISTER SONGS,And Summer move on Winter
990,SISTER SONGS,"With the trumpet of the March, and the pennon of the May;"
991,SISTER SONGS,As gesture outstrips thought;
992,SISTER SONGS,"So, haply, toyer with ethereal strings!"
993,SISTER SONGS,Are thy blind repetitions of high things
994,SISTER SONGS,The murmurous gnats whose aimless hoverings
995,SISTER SONGS,Reveal song’s summer in the air;
996,SISTER SONGS,"The outstretched hand, which cannot thought declare,"
997,SISTER SONGS,Yet is thought’s harbinger.
998,SISTER SONGS,These strains the way for thine own strains prepare;
999,SISTER SONGS,"We feel the music moist upon this breeze,"
1000,SISTER SONGS,And hope the congregating poesies.
1001,SISTER SONGS,Sundered yet by thee from us
1002,SISTER SONGS,"Wait, with wild eyes luminous,"
1003,SISTER SONGS,All thy wingèd things that are to be;
1004,SISTER SONGS,"They flit against thee, Gate of Ivory!"
1005,SISTER SONGS,"They clamour on the portress Destiny,—"
1006,SISTER SONGS,"“Set her wide, so we may issue through!"
1007,SISTER SONGS,Our vans are quick for that they have to do!”
1008,SISTER SONGS,Suffer still your young desire;
1009,SISTER SONGS,"Your plumes but bicker at the tips with fire,"
1010,SISTER SONGS,Tarry their kindling; they will beat the higher.
1011,SISTER SONGS,"And thou, bright girl, not long shalt thou repeat"
1012,SISTER SONGS,Idly the music from thy mother caught;
1013,SISTER SONGS,"Not vainly has she wrought,"
1014,SISTER SONGS,Not vainly from the cloudward-jetting turret
1015,SISTER SONGS,"Of her aërial mind, for thy weak feet,"
1016,SISTER SONGS,Let down the silken ladder of her thought.
1017,SISTER SONGS,"She bare thee with a double pain,"
1018,SISTER SONGS,Of the body and the spirit;
1019,SISTER SONGS,"Thou thy fleshly weeds hast ta’en,"
1020,SISTER SONGS,Thy diviner weeds inherit!
1021,SISTER SONGS,The precious streams which through thy young lips roll
1022,SISTER SONGS,Shall leave their lovely delta in thy soul:
1023,SISTER SONGS,Where sprites of so essential kind
1024,SISTER SONGS,"Set their paces,"
1025,SISTER SONGS,Surely they shall leave behind
1026,SISTER SONGS,The green traces
1027,SISTER SONGS,"Of their sportance in the mind,"
1028,SISTER SONGS,"And thou shalt, ere we well may know it,"
1029,SISTER SONGS,"Turn that daintiness, a poet,—"
1030,SISTER SONGS,Elfin-ring
1031,SISTER SONGS,Where sweet fancies foot and sing.
1032,SISTER SONGS,"So it may be, so it _shall_ be,—"
1033,SISTER SONGS,"Oh, take the prophecy from me!"
1034,SISTER SONGS,"What if the old fastidious sculptor, Time,"
1035,SISTER SONGS,This crescent marvel of his hands
1036,SISTER SONGS,"Carveth all too painfully,"
1037,SISTER SONGS,And I who prophesy shall never see?
1038,SISTER SONGS,"What if the niche of its predestined rhyme,"
1039,SISTER SONGS,"Its aching niche, too long expectant stands?"
1040,SISTER SONGS,Yet shall he after sore delays
1041,SISTER SONGS,On some exultant day of days
1042,SISTER SONGS,The white enshrouding childhood raise
1043,SISTER SONGS,"From thy fair spirit, finished for our gaze;"
1044,SISTER SONGS,While we (but ’mongst that happy “we”
1045,SISTER SONGS,The prophet cannot be!)
1046,SISTER SONGS,"While we behold with no astonishments,"
1047,SISTER SONGS,With that serene fulfilment of delight
1048,SISTER SONGS,Wherewith we view the sight
1049,SISTER SONGS,When the stars pitch the golden tents
1050,SISTER SONGS,Of their high campment on the plains of night.
1051,SISTER SONGS,Why should amazement be our satellite?
1052,SISTER SONGS,What wonder in such things?
1053,SISTER SONGS,"If angels have hereditary wings,"
1054,SISTER SONGS,If not by Salic law is handed down
1055,SISTER SONGS,"The poet’s crown,"
1056,SISTER SONGS,"To thee, born in the purple of the throne,"
1057,SISTER SONGS,The laurel must belong:
1058,SISTER SONGS,"Thou, in thy mother’s right"
1059,SISTER SONGS,Descendant of Castalian-chrismed kings—
1060,SISTER SONGS,O Princess of the Blood of Song!
1061,SISTER SONGS,
1062,SISTER SONGS,Peace; too impetuously have I been winging
1063,SISTER SONGS,Toward vaporous heights which beckon and beguile
1064,SISTER SONGS,"I sink back, saddened to my inmost mind;"
1065,SISTER SONGS,Even as I list a-dream that mother singing
1066,SISTER SONGS,"The poesy of sweet tone, and sadden, while"
1067,SISTER SONGS,Her voice is cast in troubled wake behind
1068,SISTER SONGS,The keel of her keen spirit.  Thou art enshrined
1069,SISTER SONGS,In a too primal innocence for this eye—
1070,SISTER SONGS,Intent on such untempered radiancy—
1071,SISTER SONGS,Not to be pained; my clay can scarce endure
1072,SISTER SONGS,Ungrieved the effluence near of essences so pure.
1073,SISTER SONGS,"Therefore, little, tender maiden,"
1074,SISTER SONGS,Never be thou overshaden
1075,SISTER SONGS,With a mind whose canopy
1076,SISTER SONGS,Would shut out the sky from thee;
1077,SISTER SONGS,Whose tangled branches intercept Heaven’s light:
1078,SISTER SONGS,I will not feed my unpastured heart
1079,SISTER SONGS,"On thee, green pleasaunce as thou art,"
1080,SISTER SONGS,To lessen by one flower thy happy daisies white.
1081,SISTER SONGS,The water-rat is earth-hued like the runlet
1082,SISTER SONGS,Whereon he swims; and how in me should lurk
1083,SISTER SONGS,"Thoughts apt to neighbour thine, thou creature sunlit?"
1084,SISTER SONGS,If through long fret and irk
1085,SISTER SONGS,Thine eyes within their browed recesses were
1086,SISTER SONGS,Worn caves where thought lay couchant in its lair;
1087,SISTER SONGS,"Wert thou a spark among dank leaves, ah ruth!"
1088,SISTER SONGS,"With age in all thy veins, while all thy heart was youth;"
1089,SISTER SONGS,Our contact might run smooth.
1090,SISTER SONGS,But life’s Eoan dews still moist thy ringèd hair;
1091,SISTER SONGS,Dian’s chill finger-tips
1092,SISTER SONGS,Thaw if at night they happen on thy lips;
1093,SISTER SONGS,The flying fringes of the sun’s cloak frush
1094,SISTER SONGS,The fragile leaves which on those warm lips blush;
1095,SISTER SONGS,And joy only lurks retirèd
1096,SISTER SONGS,In the dim gloaming of thine irid.
1097,SISTER SONGS,"Then since my love drags this poor shadow, me,"
1098,SISTER SONGS,"And one without the other may not be,"
1099,SISTER SONGS,From both I guard thee free.
1100,SISTER SONGS,"It still is much, yes, it is much,"
1101,SISTER SONGS,Only—my dream!—to love my love of thee;
1102,SISTER SONGS,"And it is much, yes, it is much,"
1103,SISTER SONGS,In hands which thou hast touched to feel thy touch
1104,SISTER SONGS,In voices which have mingled with thine own
1105,SISTER SONGS,To hear a double tone.
1106,SISTER SONGS,"As anguish, for supreme expression prest,"
1107,SISTER SONGS,"Borrows its saddest tongue from jest,"
1108,SISTER SONGS,Thou hast of absence so create
1109,SISTER SONGS,A presence more importunate;
1110,SISTER SONGS,And thy voice pleads its sweetest suit
1111,SISTER SONGS,When it is mute.
1112,SISTER SONGS,I thank the once accursèd star
1113,SISTER SONGS,Which did me teach
1114,SISTER SONGS,"To make of Silence my familiar,"
1115,SISTER SONGS,"Who hath the rich reversion of thy speech,"
1116,SISTER SONGS,"Since the most charming sounds thy thought can wear,"
1117,SISTER SONGS,"Cast off, fall to that pale attendant’s share;"
1118,SISTER SONGS,And thank the gift which made my mind
1119,SISTER SONGS,"A shadow-world, wherethrough the shadows wind"
1120,SISTER SONGS,Of all the loved and lovely of my kind.
1121,SISTER SONGS,
1122,SISTER SONGS,"Like a maiden Saxon, folden,"
1123,SISTER SONGS,"As she flits, in moon-drenched mist;"
1124,SISTER SONGS,"Whose curls streaming flaxen-golden,"
1125,SISTER SONGS,"By the misted moonbeams kist,"
1126,SISTER SONGS,Dispread their filmy floating silk
1127,SISTER SONGS,Like honey steeped in milk:
1128,SISTER SONGS,"So, vague goldenness remote,"
1129,SISTER SONGS,Through my thoughts I watch thee float.
1130,SISTER SONGS,When the snake summer casts her blazoned skin
1131,SISTER SONGS,"We find it at the turn of autumn’s path,"
1132,SISTER SONGS,"And think it summer that rewinded hath,"
1133,SISTER SONGS,Joying therein;
1134,SISTER SONGS,"And this enamouring slough of thee, mine elf,"
1135,SISTER SONGS,I take it for thyself;
1136,SISTER SONGS,"Content.  Content?  Yea, title it content."
1137,SISTER SONGS,The very loves that belt thee must prevent
1138,SISTER SONGS,"My love, I know, with their legitimacy:"
1139,SISTER SONGS,"As the metallic vapours, that are swept"
1140,SISTER SONGS,"Athwart the sun, in his light intercept"
1141,SISTER SONGS,The very hues
1142,SISTER SONGS,Which _their_ conflagrant elements effuse.
1143,SISTER SONGS,"But, my love, my heart, my fair,"
1144,SISTER SONGS,"That only I should see thee rare,"
1145,SISTER SONGS,"Or tent to the hid core thy rarity,—"
1146,SISTER SONGS,This were a mournfulness more piercing far
1147,SISTER SONGS,"Than that those other loves my own must bar,"
1148,SISTER SONGS,Or thine for others leave thee none for me.
1149,SISTER SONGS,
1150,SISTER SONGS,"But on a day whereof I think,"
1151,SISTER SONGS,One shall dip his hand to drink
1152,SISTER SONGS,"In that still water of thy soul,"
1153,SISTER SONGS,And its imaged tremors race
1154,SISTER SONGS,"Over thy joy-troubled face,"
1155,SISTER SONGS,As the intervolved reflections roll
1156,SISTER SONGS,"From a shaken fountain’s brink,"
1157,SISTER SONGS,With swift light wrinkling its alcove.
1158,SISTER SONGS,From the hovering wing of Love
1159,SISTER SONGS,"The warm stain shall flit roseal on thy cheek,"
1160,SISTER SONGS,"Then, sweet blushet! whenas he,"
1161,SISTER SONGS,"The destined paramount of thy universe,"
1162,SISTER SONGS,"Who has no worlds to sigh for, ruling thee,"
1163,SISTER SONGS,"Àscends his vermeil throne of empery,"
1164,SISTER SONGS,One grace alone I seek.
1165,SISTER SONGS,"Oh! may this treasure-galleon of my verse,"
1166,SISTER SONGS,"Fraught with its golden passion, oared with cadent rhyme,"
1167,SISTER SONGS,"Set with a towering press of fantasies,"
1168,SISTER SONGS,"Drop safely down the time,"
1169,SISTER SONGS,Leaving mine islèd self behind it far
1170,SISTER SONGS,"Soon to be sunken in the abysm of seas,"
1171,SISTER SONGS,(As down the years the splendour voyages
1172,SISTER SONGS,"From some long ruined and night-submergèd star),"
1173,SISTER SONGS,And in thy subject sovereign’s havening heart
1174,SISTER SONGS,Anchor the freightage of its virgin ore;
1175,SISTER SONGS,Adding its wasteful more
1176,SISTER SONGS,To his own overflowing treasury.
1177,SISTER SONGS,"So through his river mine shall reach thy sea,"
1178,SISTER SONGS,Bearing its confluent part;
1179,SISTER SONGS,In his pulse mine shall thrill;
1180,SISTER SONGS,And the quick heart shall quicken from the heart that’s still.
1181,SISTER SONGS,
1182,SISTER SONGS,"Ah! help, my Dæmon that hast served me well!"
1183,SISTER SONGS,"Not at this last, oh, do not me disgrace!"
1184,SISTER SONGS,"I faint, I sicken, darkens all my sight,"
1185,SISTER SONGS,"As, poised upon this unprevisioned height,"
1186,SISTER SONGS,I lift into its place
1187,SISTER SONGS,The utmost aery traceried pinnacle.
1188,SISTER SONGS,"So; it is builded, the high tenement,"
1189,SISTER SONGS,—God grant—to mine intent!
1190,SISTER SONGS,"Most like a palace of the Occident,"
1191,SISTER SONGS,"Up-thrusting, toppling maze on maze,"
1192,SISTER SONGS,"Its mounded blaze,"
1193,SISTER SONGS,"And washèd by the sunset’s rosy waves,"
1194,SISTER SONGS,Whose sea drinks rarer hue from those rare walls it laves.
1195,SISTER SONGS,"Yet wail, my spirits, wail!"
1196,SISTER SONGS,So few therein to enter shall prevail!
1197,SISTER SONGS,"Scarce fewer could win way, if their desire"
1198,SISTER SONGS,"A dragon baulked, with involuted spire,"
1199,SISTER SONGS,And writhen snout spattered with yeasty fire.
1200,SISTER SONGS,For at the elfin portal hangs a horn
1201,SISTER SONGS,Which none can wind aright
1202,SISTER SONGS,Save the appointed knight
1203,SISTER SONGS,Whose lids the fay-wings brushed when he was born.
1204,SISTER SONGS,"All others stray forlorn,"
1205,SISTER SONGS,"Or glimpsing, through the blazoned windows scrolled"
1206,SISTER SONGS,Receding labyrinths lessening tortuously
1207,SISTER SONGS,In half obscurity;
1208,SISTER SONGS,"With mystic images, inhuman, cold,"
1209,SISTER SONGS,That flameless torches hold.
1210,SISTER SONGS,But who can wind that horn of might
1211,SISTER SONGS,"(The horn of dead Heliades) aright,—"
1212,SISTER SONGS,Straight
1213,SISTER SONGS,Open for him shall roll the conscious gate;
1214,SISTER SONGS,"And light leap up from all the torches there,"
1215,SISTER SONGS,"And life leap up in every torchbearer,"
1216,SISTER SONGS,"And the stone faces kindle in the glow,"
1217,SISTER SONGS,"And into the blank eyes the irids grow,"
1218,SISTER SONGS,And through the dawning irids ambushed meanings show.
1219,SISTER SONGS,"Illumined this wise on,"
1220,SISTER SONGS,"He threads securely the far intricacies,"
1221,SISTER SONGS,With brede from Heaven’s wrought vesture overstrewn;
1222,SISTER SONGS,"Swift Tellus’ purfled tunic, girt upon"
1223,SISTER SONGS,With the blown chlamys of her fluttering seas;
1224,SISTER SONGS,And the freaked kirtle of the pearlèd moon:
1225,SISTER SONGS,"Until he gain the structure’s core, where stands—"
1226,SISTER SONGS,A toil of magic hands—
1227,SISTER SONGS,"The unbodied spirit of the sorcerer,"
1228,SISTER SONGS,"Most strangely rare,"
1229,SISTER SONGS,As is a vision remembered in the noon;
1230,SISTER SONGS,"Unbodied, yet to mortal seeing clear,"
1231,SISTER SONGS,Like sighs exhaled in eager atmosphere.
1232,SISTER SONGS,From human haps and mutabilities
1233,SISTER SONGS,"It rests exempt, beneath the edifice"
1234,SISTER SONGS,To which itself gave rise;
1235,SISTER SONGS,Sustaining centre to the bubble of stone
1236,SISTER SONGS,"Which, breathed from it, exists by it alone."
1237,SISTER SONGS,"Yea, ere Saturnian earth her child consumes,"
1238,SISTER SONGS,"And I lie down with outworn ossuaries,"
1239,SISTER SONGS,Ere death’s grim tongue anticipates the tomb’s
1240,SISTER SONGS,"_Siste viator_, in this storied urn"
1241,SISTER SONGS,"My living heart is laid to throb and burn,"
1242,SISTER SONGS,"Till end be ended, and till ceasing cease."
1243,SISTER SONGS,
1244,SISTER SONGS,And thou by whom this strain hath parentage;
1245,SISTER SONGS,Wantoner between the yet untreacherous claws
1246,SISTER SONGS,"Of newly-whelped existence! ere he pause,"
1247,SISTER SONGS,What gift to thee can yield the archimage?
1248,SISTER SONGS,For coming seasons’ frets
1249,SISTER SONGS,"What aids, what amulets,"
1250,SISTER SONGS,"What softenings, or what brightenings?"
1251,SISTER SONGS,As Thunder writhes the lash of his long lightnings
1252,SISTER SONGS,About the growling heads of the brute main
1253,SISTER SONGS,"Foaming at mouth, until it wallow again"
1254,SISTER SONGS,In the scooped oozes of its bed of pain;
1255,SISTER SONGS,"So all the gnashing jaws, the leaping heads"
1256,SISTER SONGS,"Of hungry menaces, and of ravening dreads,"
1257,SISTER SONGS,Of pangs
1258,SISTER SONGS,"Twitch-lipped, with quivering nostrils and immitigate fangs,"
1259,SISTER SONGS,I scourge beneath the torment of my charms
1260,SISTER SONGS,That their repentless nature fear to work thee harms.
1261,SISTER SONGS,"And as yon Apollonian harp-player,"
1262,SISTER SONGS,"Yon wandering psalterist of the sky,"
1263,SISTER SONGS,"With flickering strings which scatter melody,"
1264,SISTER SONGS,"The silver-stolèd damsels of the sea,"
1265,SISTER SONGS,"Or lake, or fount, or stream,"
1266,SISTER SONGS,Enchants from their ancestral heaven of waters
1267,SISTER SONGS,To Naiad it through the unfrothing air;
1268,SISTER SONGS,My song enchants so out of undulous dream
1269,SISTER SONGS,"The glimmering shapes of its dim-tressèd daughters,"
1270,SISTER SONGS,And missions each to be thy minister.
1271,SISTER SONGS,"Saying; “O ye,"
1272,SISTER SONGS,The organ-stops of being’s harmony;
1273,SISTER SONGS,"The blushes on existence’s pale face,"
1274,SISTER SONGS,Lending it sudden grace;
1275,SISTER SONGS,Without whom we should but guess Heaven’s worth
1276,SISTER SONGS,"By blank negations of this sordid earth,"
1277,SISTER SONGS,(So haply to the blind may light
1278,SISTER SONGS,Be but gloom’s undetermined opposite);
1279,SISTER SONGS,Ye who are thus as the refracting air
1280,SISTER SONGS,Whereby we see Heaven’s sun before it rise
1281,SISTER SONGS,Above the dull line of our mortal skies;
1282,SISTER SONGS,As breathing on the strainèd ear that sighs
1283,SISTER SONGS,"From comrades viewless unto strainèd eyes,"
1284,SISTER SONGS,Soothing our terrors in the lampless night;
1285,SISTER SONGS,Ye who can make this world where all is deeming
1286,SISTER SONGS,"What world ye list, being arbiters of seeming;"
1287,SISTER SONGS,"Attend upon her ways, benignant powers!"
1288,SISTER SONGS,"Unroll ye life a carpet for her feet,"
1289,SISTER SONGS,"And cast ye down before them blossomy hours,"
1290,SISTER SONGS,Until her going shall be clogged with sweet!
1291,SISTER SONGS,"All dear emotions whose new-bathèd hair,"
1292,SISTER SONGS,"Still streaming from the soul, in love’s warm air"
1293,SISTER SONGS,Smokes with a mist of tender fantasies;
1294,SISTER SONGS,"All these,"
1295,SISTER SONGS,"And all the heart’s wild growths which, swiftly bright,"
1296,SISTER SONGS,"Spring up the crimson agarics of a night,"
1297,SISTER SONGS,"No pain in withering, yet a joy arisen;"
1298,SISTER SONGS,"And all thin shapes more exquisitely rare,"
1299,SISTER SONGS,"More subtly fair,"
1300,SISTER SONGS,Than these weak ministering words have spell to prison
1301,SISTER SONGS,Within the magic circle of this rhyme;
1302,SISTER SONGS,And all the fays who in our creedless clime
1303,SISTER SONGS,Have sadly ceased
1304,SISTER SONGS,Bearing to other children childhood’s proper feast;
1305,SISTER SONGS,"Whose robes are fluent crystal, crocus-hued,"
1306,SISTER SONGS,"Whose wings are wind a-fire, whose mantles wrought"
1307,SISTER SONGS,From spray that falling rainbows shake
1308,SISTER SONGS,"These, ye familiars to my wizard thought,"
1309,SISTER SONGS,Make things of journal custom unto her;
1310,SISTER SONGS,"With lucent feet imbrued,"
1311,SISTER SONGS,"If young Day tread, a glorious vintager,"
1312,SISTER SONGS,The wine-press of the purple-foamèd east;
1313,SISTER SONGS,"Or round the nodding sun, flush-faced and sunken,"
1314,SISTER SONGS,His wild bacchantes drunken
1315,SISTER SONGS,"Reel, with rent woofs a-flaunt, their westering rout."
1316,SISTER SONGS,"—But lo! at length the day is lingered out,"
1317,SISTER SONGS,At length my Ariel lays his viol by;
1318,SISTER SONGS,"We sing no more to thee, child, he and I;"
1319,SISTER SONGS,The day is lingered out:
1320,SISTER SONGS,In slow wreaths folden
1321,SISTER SONGS,"Around yon censer, spherèd, golden,"
1322,SISTER SONGS,Vague Vesper’s fumes aspire;
1323,SISTER SONGS,And glimmering to eclipse
1324,SISTER SONGS,The long laburnum drips
1325,SISTER SONGS,"Its honey of wild flame, its jocund spilth of fire."
1326,SISTER SONGS,
1327,SISTER SONGS,"_Now pass your ways_, _fair bird_, _and pass your ways_,"
1328,SISTER SONGS,_If you will_;
1329,SISTER SONGS,_I have you through the days_!
1330,SISTER SONGS,"_A flit or hold you still_,"
1331,SISTER SONGS,_And perch you where you list_
1332,SISTER SONGS,"_On what wrist_,—"
1333,SISTER SONGS,_You are mine through the times_!
1334,SISTER SONGS,_I have caught you fast for ever in a tangle of sweet rhymes_.
1335,SISTER SONGS,"_And in your young maiden morn_,"
1336,SISTER SONGS,"_You may scorn_,"
1337,SISTER SONGS,_But you must be_
1338,SISTER SONGS,_Bound and sociate to me_;
1339,SISTER SONGS,_With this thread from out the tomb my dead hand shall tether thee_!

1341,SISTER SONGS,* * * * *
1342,SISTER SONGS,
1343,SISTER SONGS,"Go, sister-songs, to that sweet sister-pair"
1344,SISTER SONGS,"For whom I have your frail limbs fashionèd,"
1345,SISTER SONGS,And framèd feateously;—
1346,SISTER SONGS,For whom I have your frail limbs fashionèd
1347,SISTER SONGS,"With how great shamefastness and how great dread,"
1348,SISTER SONGS,"Knowing you frail, but not if you be fair,"
1349,SISTER SONGS,Though framèd feateously;
1350,SISTER SONGS,Go unto them from me.
1351,SISTER SONGS,"Go from my shadow to their sunshine sight,"
1352,SISTER SONGS,Made for all sights’ delight;
1353,SISTER SONGS,Go like twin swans that oar the surgy storms
1354,SISTER SONGS,To bate with pennoned snows in candent air:
1355,SISTER SONGS,"Nigh with abasèd head,"
1356,SISTER SONGS,"Yourselves linked sisterly, that sister-pair,"
1357,SISTER SONGS,And go in presence there;
1358,SISTER SONGS,"Saying—“Your young eyes cannot see our forms,"
1359,SISTER SONGS,Nor read the yearning of our looks aright;
1360,SISTER SONGS,"But time shall trail the veilings from our hair,"
1361,SISTER SONGS,"And cleanse your seeing with his euphrasy,"
1362,SISTER SONGS,"(Yea, even your bright seeing make more bright,"
1363,SISTER SONGS,"Which is all sights’ delight),"
1364,SISTER SONGS,And ye shall know us for what things we be.
1365,SISTER SONGS,
1366,SISTER SONGS,"“Whilom, within a poet’s calyxed heart,"
1367,SISTER SONGS,A dewy love we trembled all apart;
1368,SISTER SONGS,Whence it took rise
1369,SISTER SONGS,"Beneath your radiant eyes,"
1370,SISTER SONGS,"Which misted it to music.  We must long,"
1371,SISTER SONGS,"A floating haze of silver subtile song,"
1372,SISTER SONGS,Await love-laden
1373,SISTER SONGS,Above each maiden
1374,SISTER SONGS,The appointed hour that o’er the hearts of you—
1375,SISTER SONGS,As vapours into dew
1376,SISTER SONGS,"Unweave, whence they were wove,—"
1377,SISTER SONGS,Shall turn our loosening musics back to love.”
1378,SISTER SONGS,
1379,SISTER SONGS,
1380,SISTER SONGS,
1381,SISTER SONGS,
1382,SISTER SONGS,Inscription
1383,SISTER SONGS,
1384,SISTER SONGS,
1385,SISTER SONGS,WHEN the last stir of bubbling melodies
1386,SISTER SONGS,Broke as my chants sank underneath the wave
1387,SISTER SONGS,"Of dulcitude, but sank again to rise"
1388,SISTER SONGS,"Where man’s embaying mind those waters lave,"
1389,SISTER SONGS,(For music hath its Oceanides
1390,SISTER SONGS,"Flexuously floating through their parent seas,"
1391,SISTER SONGS,"And such are these),"
1392,SISTER SONGS,I saw a vision—or may it be
1393,SISTER SONGS,The effluence of a dear desired reality?
1394,SISTER SONGS,"I saw two spirits high,—"
1395,SISTER SONGS,"Two spirits, dim within the silver smoke"
1396,SISTER SONGS,Which is for ever woke
1397,SISTER SONGS,By snowing lights of fountained Poesy.
1398,SISTER SONGS,Two shapes they were familiar as love;
1399,SISTER SONGS,"They were those souls, whereof"
1400,SISTER SONGS,"One twines from finest gracious daily things,"
1401,SISTER SONGS,"Strong, constant, noticeless, as are heart-strings"
1402,SISTER SONGS,The golden cage wherein this song-bird sings;
1403,SISTER SONGS,"And the other’s sun gives hue to all my flowers,"
1404,SISTER SONGS,"Which else pale flowers of Tartarus would grow,"
1405,SISTER SONGS,Where ghosts watch ghosts of blooms in ghostly bowers;—
1406,SISTER SONGS,For we do know
1407,SISTER SONGS,"The hidden player by his harmonies,"
1408,SISTER SONGS,And by my thoughts I know what still hands thrill the keys.
1409,SISTER SONGS,
1410,SISTER SONGS,And to these twain—as from the mind’s abysses
1411,SISTER SONGS,"All thoughts draw toward the awakening heart’s sweet kisses,"
1412,SISTER SONGS,"With proffer of their wreathen fantasies,—"
1413,SISTER SONGS,Even so to these
1414,SISTER SONGS,"I saw how many brought their garlands fair,"
1415,SISTER SONGS,"Whether of song, or simple love, they were,—"
1416,SISTER SONGS,"Of simple love, that makes best garlands fair."
1417,SISTER SONGS,"But one I marked who lingered still behind,"
1418,SISTER SONGS,As for such souls no seemly gift had he:
1419,SISTER SONGS,"He was not of their strain,"
1420,SISTER SONGS,"Nor worthy of so bright beings to entertain,"
1421,SISTER SONGS,Nor fit compeer for such high company.
1422,SISTER SONGS,"Yet was he, surely, born to them in mind,"
1423,SISTER SONGS,Their youngest nursling of the spirit’s kind.
1424,SISTER SONGS,"Last stole this one,"
1425,SISTER SONGS,"With timid glance, of watching eyes adread,"
1426,SISTER SONGS,And dropped his frightened flower when all were gone;
1427,SISTER SONGS,"And where the frail flower fell, it witherèd."
1428,SISTER SONGS,But yet methought those high souls smiled thereon;
1429,SISTER SONGS,"As when a child, upstraining at your knees"
1430,SISTER SONGS,"Some fond and fancied nothings, says, “I give you these!”"
