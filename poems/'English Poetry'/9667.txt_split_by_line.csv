39,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,We propose to introduce our 'Specimens' by a short Essay on the Origin
40,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and Progress of English Poetry on to the days of Chaucer and of Gower.
41,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Having called, in conjunction with many other critics, Chaucer 'the"
42,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Father of English Poetry,' to seek to go back further may seem like"
43,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"pursuing antenatal researches. But while Chaucer was the sun, a certain"
44,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"glimmering dawn had gone before him, and to reflect that, is the object"
45,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of the following pages.
46,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
47,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
48,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Britain, when the Romans invaded it, was a barbarous country; and although"
49,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"subjugated and long held by that people, they seem to have left it nearly"
50,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as uncultivated and illiterate as they found it. 'No magnificent remains,'"
51,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"says Macaulay, 'of Latian porches and aqueducts are to be found in Britain."
52,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,No writer of British birth is to be reckoned among the masters of Latin
53,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"poetry and eloquence. It is not probable that the islanders were, at any"
54,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"time, generally familiar with the tongue of their Italian rulers. From"
55,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the Atlantic to the vicinity of the Rhine the Latin has, during many"
56,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"centuries, been predominant. It drove out the Celtic--it was not driven"
57,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"out by the Teutonic--and it is at this day the basis of the French,"
58,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Spanish, and Portuguese languages. In our island the Latin appears never"
59,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"to have superseded the old Gaelic speech, and could not stand its ground"
60,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,before the German.' It was in the fifth century that that modification
61,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of the German or Teutonic speech called the Anglo-Saxon was introduced
62,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,into this country. It soon asserted its superiority over the British
63,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"tongue, which seemed to retreat before it, reluctantly and proudly, like"
64,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a lion, into the mountain-fastnesses of Wales or to the rocky sea-beach"
65,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of Cornwall. The triumph was not completed all at once, but from the"
66,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"beginning it was secure. The bards of Wales continued to sing, but their"
67,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"strains resembled the mutterings of thunder among their own hills, only"
68,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"half heard in the distant valleys, and exciting neither curiosity nor awe."
69,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For five centuries, with the exception of some Latin words added by the"
70,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"preachers of Christianity, the Anglo-Saxon language continued much as it"
71,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"was when first introduced. Barbarous as the manners of the people were,"
72,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,literature was by no means left without a witness. Its chief cultivators
73,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"were the monks and other religious persons, who spent their leisure in"
74,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"multiplying books, either by original composition or by transcription,"
75,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"including treatises on theology, historical chronicles, and a great"
76,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,abundance and variety of poetical productions. These were written at first
77,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"exclusively in Latin, but occasionally, in process of time, in the Anglo-"
78,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Saxon tongue. The theology taught in them was, no doubt, crude and"
79,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"corrupted, the history was stuffed with fables, and the poetry was rough"
80,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and bald in the extreme; but still they furnished a food fitted for the
81,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,awakening mind of the age. When the Christian religion reached Great
82,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Britain, it brought necessarily with it an impulse to intellect as well"
83,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as to morality. So startling are the facts it relates, so broad and deep"
84,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the principles it lays down, so humane the spirit it inculcates, and so"
85,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"ravishing the hopes it awakens, that, however disguised in superstition"
86,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and clouded by imperfect representation, it never fails to produce, in all"
87,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"countries to which it comes, a resurrection of the nation's virtue, and a"
88,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"revival, for a time at least, of the nation's political and intellectual"
89,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,energy and genius. Hence we find the very earliest literary names in our
90,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,early annals are those of Christian missionaries. Such is said to have
91,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"been Gildas, a Briton, who lived in the first part of the sixth century,"
92,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and is the reputed author of a short history of Britain in Latin. Such was
93,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the still more apocryphal Nennius, also called, till of late, the writer"
94,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of a small Latin historical work. Such was St Columbanus, who was born"
95,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,in Ireland in 560; became a monk in the Irish monastery of Benchor; and
96,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"afterwards, at the head of twelve disciples, preached Christianity, in its"
97,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"most ascetic form, in England and in France; founded in the latter country"
98,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"various monasteries; and, when banished by Queen Brunehaut on account of"
99,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"his stern inflexibility of character, went to Switzerland, and then to"
100,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Lombardy, proselytising the heathen, and defending, by his letters and"
101,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"other writings, the peculiar tenets of the Irish Church in reference to"
102,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the time of the celebration of Easter and to the popular heresies of the
103,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"day. He died October 2, 615, in the monastery of Bobbio; and his religious"
104,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,treatises and Latin poetry gave an undoubted impulse to the age's progress
105,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,in letters.
106,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
107,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"About this period the better sort of Saxons, both clergy and laity, got"
108,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"into the habit of visiting Rome; while Rome, in her turn, sent emissaries"
109,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"to England. Thus, while the one insensibly imbibed new knowledge as well"
110,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as devotion from the great centre, the other brought with them to our"
111,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"shores importations of books, including copies of such religious classics"
112,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as Josephus and Chrysostom, and of such literary classics as Homer. About"
113,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"680, died Caedmon, a monk of Whitby, one of the first who composed in"
114,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Anglo-Saxon, and some of whose compositions are preserved. Strange and"
115,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,myth-like stories are told by Bede about this remarkable natural genius.
116,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"He was originally a cow-herd. Partly from want of training, and partly"
117,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"from bashfulness, when the harp was given him in the hall, and he was"
118,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"asked, as all others were, to raise the voice of song, Caedmon had often"
119,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"to abscond in confusion. On one occasion he had retired to the stable,"
120,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,where he fell into a sound sleep. He dreamed that a stranger appeared to
121,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"him, and said, 'Caedmon, sing me something.' Caedmon replied that it was"
122,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,his incapacity to sing which had brought him to take refuge in the stable.
123,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'Nay,' said the stranger, 'but thou hast something to sing.' 'What shall I"
124,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"sing?' rejoined Caedmon. 'Sing the Creation,' and thereupon he began to"
125,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"pour out verses, which, when he awoke, he remembered, repeated, and to"
126,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"which he added others as good. The first lines are, as translated into"
127,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"English, the following:--"
128,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
129,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Now let us praise
130,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"The Guardian of heaven,"
131,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The might of the Creator
132,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,And his counsel--
133,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Glory!--Father of men!
134,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"He first created,"
135,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For the children of men,"
136,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Heaven as a roof--
137,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The holy Creator!
138,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Then the world--
139,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Guardian of mankind!
140,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Eternal Lord!
141,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Produced afterwards
142,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Earth for men--
143,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Almighty Master!'
144,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
145,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Our readers all remember the well-known story of Coleridge falling asleep
146,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,over Purchas's 'Pilgrims'; how the poem of 'Kubla Khan' came rushing
147,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"from dreamland upon his soul; and how, when awakened, he wrote it down,"
148,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and found it to be, if not sense, something better--a glorious piece"
149,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of fantastic imagination. We knew a gentleman who, slumbering while in"
150,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a state of bad health, produced, in the course of a few hours, one or"
151,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"two thousand rhymed lines, some of which he repeated in our hearing"
152,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"afterwards, and which were full of point and poetry. We cannot see that"
153,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Caedmon's lines betray any weird inspiration; but when rehearsed the next
154,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"day to the Abbess Hilda, to whom the town-bailiff of Whitby conducted him,"
155,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,she and a circle of learned men pronounced that he had received the gift
156,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of song direct from heaven! They, after one or two other trials of his"
157,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"powers, persuaded him to become a monk in the house of the Abbess, who"
158,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,commanded him to transfer to verse the whole of the Scripture history. It
159,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,is said that he was constantly employed in repeating to himself what he
160,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"had heard; or, as one of his old biographers has it, 'like a clean animal"
161,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"ruminating it, he turned it into most sweet verse.' In this way he wrote"
162,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"or rather improvised a vast quantity of poetry, chiefly on religious"
163,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"subjects. Thorpe, in his edition of this author, has preserved a speech"
164,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of Satan, bearing a striking resemblance to some parts of Milton:--"
165,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
166,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,'Boiled within him
167,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"His thought about his heart,"
168,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Hot was without him,"
169,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,His due punishment.
170,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"""This narrow place is most unlike"
171,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,That other that we formerly knew
172,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"High in heaven's kingdom,"
173,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Which my master bestowed on me,"
174,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Though we it, for the All-Powerful,"
175,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,May not possess.

196,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Me hath the clasping of these rings,"
197,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"This hard-polished band,"
198,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Impeded in my course,"
199,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Debarred me from my way.
200,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"My feet are bound,"
201,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,My hands manacled;
202,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Of these hell-doors are
203,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"The ways obstructed,"
204,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,So that with aught I cannot
205,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,From these limb-bonds escape.
206,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,About me lie
207,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Huge gratings
208,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Of hard iron,"
209,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Forged with heat,"
210,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,With which me God
211,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Hath fastened by the neck.
212,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Thus perceive I that he knoweth my mind,"
213,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"And that he knew also,"
214,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"The Lord of hosts,"
215,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,That should us through Adam
216,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Evil befall,"
217,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"About the realm of heaven,"
218,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Where I had power of my hands.""'"
219,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
220,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Through these rude lines there flashes forth, like fire through a thick"
221,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"dull grating, a powerful conception--one which Milton has borrowed and"
222,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,developed--that of the Evil One feeling in his dark bosom jealousy at
223,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"young Man, almost overpowering his hatred to God; and another conception"
224,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"still more striking, that of the devil's thorough conviction that all"
225,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"his plans and thoughts are entirely known by his great Adversary, and"
226,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,are counteracted before they are formed--
227,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
228,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,'Thus perceive I that he knoweth my mind.'
229,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
230,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Compare this with Milton's lines--
231,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
232,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,'So should I purchase dear
233,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Short intermission, bought with double smart."
234,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,_This knows_ my Punisher; therefore as far
235,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"From granting he, as I from begging peace.'"
236,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
237,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Caedmon saw, without being able fully to express, the complex idea of"
238,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Satan, as distracted between a thousand thoughts, all miserable--tossed"
239,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"between a thousand winds, all hot as hell--'pale ire, envy, and despair'"
240,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,struggling within him--fury at man overlapping anger at God--remorse and
241,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,reckless desperation wringing each other's miserable hands--a sense of
242,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"guilt which will not confess, a fear that will not quake, a sorrow that"
243,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"will not weep, a respect for God which will not worship; and yet,"
244,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"springing out of all these elements, a strange, proud joy, as though"
245,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the torrid soil of Pandemonium should flower, which makes 'the hell he"
246,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"suffers seem a heaven,' compared to what his destiny might be were he"
247,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"either plunged into a deeper abyss, or taken up unchanged to his former"
248,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"abode of glory. This, in part at least, the monk of Whitby discerned;"
249,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,but it was reserved for Milton to embody it in that tremendous figure
250,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"which has since continued to dwindle all the efforts of art, and to"
251,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"haunt, like a reality, the human imagination."
252,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
253,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Passing over some interesting but subordinate Saxon writers, such as"
254,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Ceolfrid, Abbot of Wearmouth; Aldhelm, Abbot of Malmesbury; Felix of"
255,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Croyland; and Alcuine, King Egbert's librarian at York, we come to one"
256,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,who himself formed an era in the history of our early literature--the
257,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,venerable Bede. This famous man was educated in the monastery of
258,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Wearmouth, and there appears to have spent the whole of his quiet,"
259,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"innocent, and studious life. He was the very sublimation of a book-worm."
260,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"One might fancy him becoming at last, as in the 'Metamorphoses' of Ovid,"
261,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"one of the books, or rolls of vellum and parchment over which he con-"
262,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"stantly pored. That he did not marry, or was given in marriage, we are"
263,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"certain; but there is little evidence that he even ate or drank, walked"
264,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,or slept. To read and to write seemed the 'be all and the end all' of
265,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,his existence. Important as well as numerous were his contributions
266,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,to literature. He translated from the Scriptures. He wrote religious
267,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"treatises, biographies, and commentaries upon portions of Holy Writ."
268,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Besides his very valuable Ecclesiastical History, he composed various"
269,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,pieces of Latin poetry. His works in all were forty-four in number: and
270,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,it is said that on the very day of his death (it took place in 735) he
271,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"was dictating to his amanuensis, and had just completed a book. His works"
272,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"are wonderful for his time, and not the less interesting for a fine"
273,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"cobweb of fable which is woven over parts of them, and which seems in"
274,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"keeping with their venerable character. Thus, in speaking of the Magi who"
275,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"visited the infant Redeemer, he is very particular in describing their"
276,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"age, appearance, and offerings. Melchior, the first, was old, had gray"
277,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"hair, and a long beard; and offered 'gold' to Christ, in, acknowledgment"
278,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of His sovereignty. Gaspar, the second, was young, and had no beard;"
279,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and he offered 'frankincense,' in recognition of our Lord's divinity."
280,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Balthasar, the third, was of a dark complexion, had a large beard, and"
281,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"offered 'myrrh' to our Saviour's humanity. We should, we confess, miss"
282,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,such pleasant little myths in other old books besides Bede's Histories.
283,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"They seem appropriate to ancient works, as the beard is to the goat"
284,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,or the hermit; and the truth that lies in them is not difficult to
285,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,eliminate. The next name of note in our literary annals is that of the
286,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"great Alfred. Surely if ever man was not only before his age, but before"
287,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'all ages,' it was he. A palm of the tropics growing on a naked Highland"
288,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"mountain-side, or an English oak bending over one of the hot springs of"
289,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Hecla, were not a stranger or more preternatural sight than a man like"
290,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Alfred appearing in a century like the ninth. A thousand theories about
291,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"men being the creatures of their age, the products of circumstances, &c.,"
292,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,sink into abeyance beside the facts of his life; and we are driven to the
293,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,good old belief that to some men the 'inspiration of the Almighty giveth
294,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"understanding;' and that their wisdom, their genius, and their excellency"
295,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,do not proceed from them-selves. On his deeds of valour and patriotism it
296,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,is not necessary to dwell. These form the popular and bepraised side of
297,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"his character, but they give a very inadequate idea of the whole. On one"
298,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,occasion he visited the Danish camp--a king disguised as a harper; but
299,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"he was, all his life long, a harper disguised as a king. He was at once"
300,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a warrior, a legislator, an architect, a shipbuilder, a philosopher,"
301,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a scholar, and a poet. His great object, as avowed in his last will,"
302,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,was to leave his people 'free as their own thoughts.' Hence he bent the
303,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"whole force of his mind, first, to defend them from foreign foes, by"
304,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,encouraging the new naval strength he had himself established; and then
305,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"to cultivate their intellects, and make them, as well as their country,"
306,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,worth defending. Let us quote the glowing words of Burke:--'He was
307,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,indefatigable in his endeavours to bring into England men of learning in
308,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"all branches from every part of Europe, and unbounded in his liberality"
309,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,to them. He enacted by a law that every person possessed of two hides of
310,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,land should send their children to school until sixteen. He enterprised
311,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,even a greater design than that of forming the growing generation--to
312,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"instruct even the grown, enjoining all his sheriffs and other officers"
313,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"immediately to apply themselves to learning, or to quit their offices."
314,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Whatever trouble he took to extend the benefits of learning among his
315,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"subjects, he shewed the example himself, and applied to the cultivation"
316,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of his mind with unparalleled diligence and success. He could neither
317,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"read nor write at twelve years old, but he improved his time in such"
318,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a manner, that he became one of the most knowing men of his age, in"
319,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"geometry, in philosophy, in architecture, and in music. He applied"
320,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,himself to the improvement of his native language; he translated several
321,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"valuable works from Latin, and wrote a vast number of poems in the Saxon"
322,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,tongue with a wonderful facility and happiness. He not only excelled in
323,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the theory of the arts and sciences, but possessed a great mechanical"
324,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"genius for the executive part. He improved the manner of shipbuilding,"
325,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"introduced a more beautiful and commodious architecture, and even taught"
326,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,his countrymen the art of making bricks; most of the buildings having
327,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"been of wood before his time--in a word, he comprehended in the greatness"
328,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of his mind the whole of government, and all its parts at once; and what"
329,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,is most difficult to human frailty was at the same time sublime and
330,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,minute.'
331,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
332,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Some exaggeration must be allowed for in all this account of Alfred the
333,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Great. But the fact that he left a stamp in his age so deep,--that"
334,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"nothing except what was good and great has been ascribed to him,--that"
335,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the very fictions told of him are of such _vraisemblance_ and magnitude
336,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as to FIT IN to nothing less than an extraordinary man,--and that, as"
337,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Burke says, 'whatever dark spots of human frailty may have adhered to"
338,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"such a character, are entirely hid in the splendour of many shining"
339,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"qualities and grand virtues, that throw a glory over the obscure period"
340,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"in which he lived, and which is for no other reason worthy of our"
341,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"knowledge,'--all proclaim his supremacy. Like many great men,--like"
342,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Julius Caesar, with his epilepsy--or Sir Walter Scott and Byron, with"
343,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"their lameness--or Schleiermacher, with his deformed appearance,--a"
344,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"physical infirmity beset Alfred most of his life, and at last carried"
345,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"him off at a comparatively early age. This was a disease in his bowels,"
346,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"which had long afflicted him, 'without interrupting his designs, or"
347,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"souring his temper.' Nay, who can say that the constant presence of such"
348,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a memento of weakness and mortality did not operate as a strong, quiet"
349,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"stimulus to do with his might what his hand found to do--to lower pride,"
350,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and to prompt to labour? If Saladin had had for his companion some such
351,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"faithful hound of sorrow, it would have saved him the ostentatious flag"
352,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"stretched over his head, in the hour of wassail, with the inscription,"
353,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'Saladin, Saladin, king of kings! Saladin must die!'"
354,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
355,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Alfred wrote little that was original, but he was a copious translator."
356,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,He rendered into the Anglo-Saxon tongue--which he sought to enrich with
357,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the fatness of other soils--the historical works of Orosius and of Bede;
358,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"nay, it is said the Fables of Aesop, and the Psalms of David--desirous,"
359,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"it would seem, to teach his people morality and religion, through the"
360,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"fine medium, of fiction and poetry."
361,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
362,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Alfric, Archbishop of Canterbury, is the name of another important"
363,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,contributor to Saxon literature. He wrote a grammar of his native
364,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"language, which procured him the name of the 'Grammarian,' besides a"
365,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"collection of homilies, some theological treatises, and a translation"
366,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of the first seven books of the Old Testament. In imitation of Alfred,"
367,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"he devoted all his energies to the instruction of the common people,"
368,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"constantly writing in Anglo-Saxon, and avoiding as much as possible the"
369,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"use of compound or obscure words. After him appeared Cynewulf, Bishop of"
370,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Winchester, Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, and others of some note. There"
371,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"was also slowly piled up in the course of ages, and by a succession of"
372,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"authors, that remarkable production, 'The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.' This"
373,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"is thought to have commenced soon after the reign of Alfred, and"
374,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"continued till the times of Henry II. Previous, however, to the Norman"
375,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"invasion, there had been a decided falling off in the learning of the"
376,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Saxons. This arose from various causes. Incessant wars tended to
377,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,conserve and increase the barbarism of the people. Various libraries
378,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of value were destroyed by the incursions of the Danes. And not a few
379,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"bishops, and other ecclesiastical dignitaries, began to consider"
380,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,learning as prejudicial to piety-and grammar and ungodliness were
381,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,thought akin. The effect of this upon the subordinate clergy was most
382,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"pernicious. In the tenth century, Oswald, Archbishop of Canterbury,"
383,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"found the monks of his province so grossly ignorant, not only of"
384,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"letters, but even of the canonical rules of their respective orders,"
385,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,that he required to send to France for competent masters to give them
386,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,instruction.
387,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
388,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"At length came the Conqueror, William, and one battle gave England to"
389,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the Normans, which had cost the Romans, the Saxons, and the Danes so"
390,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"much time and blood to acquire. The people were not only conquered, but"
391,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,cowed and crushed. England was as easily and effectually subdued as was
392,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Ireland, sometime after, by Henry II. But while the Conquest was for a"
393,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"season fatal to liberty, it was from the first favourable to every"
394,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"species of literature, art, and poetry. 'The influence,' says Campbell,"
395,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,'of the Norman Conquest upon the language of England was like that of a
396,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"great inundation, which at first buries the face of the landscape under"
397,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"its waters, but which, at last subsiding, leaves behind it the elements"
398,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of new beauty and fertility. Its first effect was to degrade the Anglo-
399,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Saxon tongue to the exclusive use of the inferior orders, and by the"
400,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"transference of estates ecclesiastical benefices, and civil dignities to"
401,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Norman possessors, to give the French language, which had begun to"
402,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"prevail at court from the time of Edward the Confessor, a more complete"
403,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,predominance among the higher classes of society. The native gentry of
404,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"England were either driven into exile, or depressed into a state of"
405,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"dependence on their conqueror, which habituated them to speak his"
406,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"language. On the other hand, we received from the Normans the first"
407,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,germs of romantic poetry; and our language was ultimately indebted to
408,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,them for a wealth and compass of expression which it probably would not
409,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,have otherwise possessed.'
410,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
411,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"The Anglo-Saxon, however, held its place long among the lower orders,"
412,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and specimens of it, both in prose and verse, are found a century after"
413,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the Conquest. Gradually the Norman tongue began to amalgamate with it,"
414,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and the result was, the English. At what precise year our language might"
415,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"be said to begin, it is impossible to determine. Throughout the whole of"
416,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the twelfth century, great changes were taking place in the grammatical"
417,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"construction, as well as in the substance of the Anglo-Saxon. Some new"
418,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"words were imported from the Norman, but, as Dr Johnson remarks, 'the"
419,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"language was still more materially altered by the change of its sounds,"
420,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the cutting short of its syllables, and the softening down of its"
421,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"terminations, and inflections of words.' Somewhere between 1180 and"
422,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"1216, the majestic speech in which Shakspeare was to write 'Macbeth'"
423,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and 'King Lear,' Lord Bacon his 'Advancement of Learning,' Milton his"
424,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'Paradise Lost' and 'Areopagitica,' Burke his 'Reflections,' and Sir"
425,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Walter Scott the Waverley Novels, and whose rough, but manly accents"
426,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"were to be spoken by at least a hundred million tongues, commenced its"
427,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"career, and not since Homer,"
428,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
429,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"""on the Chian strand,"
430,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssee
431,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea,"""
432,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
433,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,had a nobler era been marked in the history of literature. For here was
434,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,a tongue born which was destined to mate even with that of Greece in
435,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"richness and flexibility, to make the language of Cicero and Virgil seem"
436,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"stiff and stilted in comparison, and, if not to vie with the French in"
437,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"airy grace, or with the Italian in liquid music, to excel them far in"
438,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,teeming resources and robust energy. Memorable and hallowed for ever be
439,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the hour when the 'well of English undefiled' first sparkled to the day!
440,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
441,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Previous to this the chief of the poets, after the Conquest, were"
442,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Normans. The country whence that people came had for some time been
443,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"celebrated for poetry. France was, as to its poetic literature, divided"
444,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,into two great sections--the Provençal and the Northern. The first was
445,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"like the country where it flourished--gay, flowery, and exuberant; it"
446,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"swam in romance, and its rhymers delighted, when addressing large"
447,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"audiences under the open skies of their delightful climate, to indulge"
448,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"in compliment and fanfaronade, to sing of war, wine, and love."
449,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
450,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The Normans produced a race of simpler poets. That some of them were men
451,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as well as singers, is proved by the fact that it was a bard named"
452,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Taillefer who first broke the English ranks at the battle of Hastings.
453,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"After him came Philippe de Thaun, who tried to set to song the science"
454,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of his day; Thorold, the author of a romance entitled 'Roland;' Samson"
455,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"de Nauteuil, the translator of Solomon's Proverbs into French verse;"
456,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Geoffrey Gaimar, who wrote a Chronicle of the Saxon kings; and one"
457,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"David, a minstrel of no little note and power in his day. But a more"
458,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"remarkable writer succeeded, and his work, like Aaron's rod, swallowed"
459,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"up all the productions of these clever but petty poets. This was Wace,"
460,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"commonly called Maistre Wace, a native of Jersey. In 1160, or as some"
461,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"say 1155, Wace finished his 'Brut d'Angleterre' which is in reality a"
462,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"translation into French of Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote a History"
463,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,of Britain from the imaginary Brutus of Troy down to Cadwallader in
464,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,689. Literature owes not a little to Wace's poem. He collected into
465,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,a permanent shape a number of traditions and legends--many of them
466,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"interesting--which had been floating through Europe, just as Macpherson"
467,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"preserved in Ossian not a few real fragments of the songs of Selma. And,"
468,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as we shall see immediately, Wace's production became the basis of the"
469,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,earliest of English poems.
470,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
471,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Maistre Wace is the author also of a History of the Normans, which he"
472,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"calls 'Roman de Rou;' or, 'The Romance of Rollo.' He was a great favourite"
473,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"with Henry II., who bestowed on him a canonry in the Cathedral of Bayeux."
474,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Besides Wace, there flourished about the same time Benoit, who wrote a"
475,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"History of the Dukes of Normandy; and Guernes, a churchman of Pont St"
476,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Maxence in Picardy, who wrote in verse a Life of St Thomas à Becket."
477,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
478,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"At the beginning of the century following the Conquest, the chief authors,"
479,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"such as Peter of Blois, John of Salisbury, Joseph of Exeter, and Geoffrey"
480,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of Monmouth, all wrote in Latin. Layamon, however, a priest of Ernesley-"
481,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"upon-Severn, used the vernacular in a poem which, as we have already"
482,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"hinted, was essentially a translation of Wace's 'Brut d'Angleterre.' The"
483,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,most remarkable thing about Layamon's poem is the language in which it is
484,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,written-language in which you catch English in the very act of chipping
485,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"the Saxon shell, or, as Campbell happily remarks, 'the style of Layamon is"
486,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,as nearly the intermediate state of the old and new languages as can be
487,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,found in any ancient specimen --something like the new insect stirring its
488,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,wings before it has shaken off the aurelia state.'
489,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
490,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Between Layamon and Robert of Gloucester a good many miscellaneous
491,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"strains--some of a satirical, others of an amatory, and others again of"
492,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,a legendary and devout style--were produced. It was customary then for
493,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"minstrels, at the instance of the clergy, to sing on Sundays devotional"
494,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"strains on the harp to the assembled multitudes. At public entertainments,"
495,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"during week-days, gay ditties were common. One of these is extant, but"
496,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"is too coarse for quotation. It is entitled 'The Land of Cokayne,' an"
497,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"allegorical satire on the luxury and vice of the Church, given under the"
498,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"description of an imaginary paradise, in which the nuns are represented"
499,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as houris, and the black and grey monks as their paramours. 'Richard of"
500,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Alemaine' is a ballad, composed by an adherent of Simon de Montfort, Earl"
501,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"of Leicester, after the defeat of the Royal party at the battle of Lewes"
502,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"in 1264. In the year after that battle the Royal cause rallied, and the"
503,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Earl of Warren and Sir Hugh Bigod returned from exile, and helped the King"
504,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"in his victory. In the battle of Lewes, Richard, King of the Romans, his"
505,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"brother Henry III., and Prince Edward, with many others of the Royal"
506,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"party, were taken prisoners."
507,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"[Note: See 'Richard of Alemaine,' Percy's Reliques, vol. ii., p. 2.]"
508,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
509,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,The spirit and the allusions of this song shew that it was composed by
510,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Leicester's party in the moment of their victory, and not after the"
511,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"reaction which took place against their cause, and it must therefore"
512,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"belong to the thirteenth century. To this period, too, probably belongs"
513,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a political satire, published by Ritson, and which Campbell thus charac-"
514,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"terises:--'It is a ballad on the execution of the Scottish patriots, Sir"
515,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,William Wallace and Sir Simon Frazer. The diction is as barbarous as we
516,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,should expect from a song of triumph on such a subject. It relates the
517,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,death and treatment of Wallace very minutely. The circumstance of his
518,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"being covered with a mock crown of laurel in Westminster Hall, which Stow"
519,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"repeats, is there mentioned, and that of his legs being fastened with iron"
520,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"fetters ""_under his horse's wombe_"" is told with savage exultation. The"
521,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,piece was probably indited in the very year of the political murders which
522,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"it celebrates, certainly before 1314, as it mentions the skulking of"
523,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Robert Bruce, which, after the battle of Bannockburn, must have become"
524,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,a jest out of season.'
525,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
526,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Campbell quotes a love-ditty of this period, which is not devoid of"
527,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,merit:--
528,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
529,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'For her love I cark and cave,"
530,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For her love I droop and dare,"
531,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For her love my bliss is bare,"
532,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,And all I wax wan.
533,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
534,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'For her love in sleep I slake,[1]"
535,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"For her love all night I wake,"
536,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,For her love mourning I make
537,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,More than any man.'
538,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
539,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,[1] 'In sleep I slake:' am deprived of sleep.
540,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
541,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
542,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,And another of a pastoral vein:--
543,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
544,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"'When the nightingale singës the woods waxen green,"
545,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Leaf, grass, and blossom springs in Avril I ween,"
546,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"And love is to my heart gone, with one spear so keen,"
547,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Night and day my blood it drinks, my heart doth me teen.'"
548,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
549,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,About a hundred years after Layamon (in 1280) appeared a poet not
550,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"dissimilar to him, named Robert of Gloucester. His surname is unknown, and"
551,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,so are the particulars of his history. We know only that he was a monk of
552,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"Gloucester Abbey, that he lived in the reigns of Henry III. and Edward I.,"
553,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"and that he translated the Legends of Geoffrey of Monmouth, and continued"
554,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,the History of England down to the time of Edward I. This work is wonder-
555,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"fully minute, and, generally speaking, accurate in its topography as well"
556,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"as narrative, and was of service to Selden when he wrote his Notes to"
557,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Drayton's 'Polyolbion.' It is more valuable in this respect than as a
558,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,piece of imagination.
559,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,
560,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,He narrates the grandest events--such as the first crusaders bursting
561,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"into Asia, with a sword of fire hung in the firmament before them, and"
562,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,beckoning them on their way--as coolly as he might the emigration of a
563,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"colony of ants. Yet, although there is little animation or poetry in his"
564,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"general manner, he usually succeeds in riveting the reader's attention;"
565,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,and the speeches he puts into the mouths of his heroes glow with at
566,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,least rhetorical fire. And as a critic truly remarks--'Injustice to the
567,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"ancient versifier, we should remember that he had still only a rude"
568,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"language to employ, the speech of boors and burghers, which, though it"
569,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"might possess a few songs and satires, could afford him no models of"
570,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,heroic narration. In such an age the first occupant passes uninspired
571,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,over subjects which might kindle the highest enthusiasm in the poet of
572,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"a riper period, as the savage treads unconsciously in his deserts over"
573,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,"mines of incalculable value, without sagacity to discover or inplements"
574,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,to explore them.' We give the following extracts from Robert of
575,INTRODUCTORY ESSAY,Gloucester's poem:--

1378,A BATTLE,"Davie was also the author of an original poem, entitled, 'Visions in"
1379,A BATTLE,"Verse,' and of the 'Battle of Jerusalem,' in which he versifies a French"
1380,A BATTLE,romance. In this production Pilate is represented as challenging our
1381,A BATTLE,Lord to single combat!
1382,A BATTLE,
1383,A BATTLE,"In 1349, died Richard Rollo, a hermit, and a verse-writer. He lived a"
1384,A BATTLE,"secluded life near the nunnery of Hampole in Yorkshire, and wrote a"
1385,A BATTLE,"number of devotional pieces, most of them very dull. In 1350, Lawrence"
1386,A BATTLE,Minot produced some short narrative ballads on the victories of Edward
1387,A BATTLE,"III., beginning with Halidon Hill, and ending with the siege of Guisnes"
1388,A BATTLE,Castle. His works lay till the end of the last century obscure in a MS.
1389,A BATTLE,"of the Cotton Collection, which was supposed to be a transcript of the"
1390,A BATTLE,Works of Chaucer. On a spare leaf of the MS. there had been accidentally
1391,A BATTLE,"written a name, probably that of its original possessor, 'Richard"
1392,A BATTLE,Chawsir.' This the getter-up of the Cotton catalogue imagined to be the
1393,A BATTLE,"name of Geoffrey Chaucer. Mr Tyrwhitt, while foraging for materials to"
1394,A BATTLE,"his edition of 'The Canterbury Tales,' accidentally found out who the"
1395,A BATTLE,"real writer was; and Ritson afterwards published Minot's ballads, which"
1396,A BATTLE,"are ten in number, written in the northern dialect, and in an alliterative"
1397,A BATTLE,"style, and with considerable spirit and liveliness. He has been called the"
1398,A BATTLE,Tyrtaeus of his age.
1399,A BATTLE,
1400,A BATTLE,We come now to the immediate predecessor of Chaucer--Robert Langlande.
1401,A BATTLE,"He was a secular priest, born at Mortimer's Cleobury, in Shropshire,"
1402,A BATTLE,"and educated at Oriel College, Oxford. He wrote, towards the end of the"
1403,A BATTLE,"fourteenth century, a very remarkable work, entitled, 'Visions of William"
1404,A BATTLE,concerning Piers Plowman.' The general object of this poem is to denounce
1405,A BATTLE,"the abuses of society, and to inculcate, upon both clergy and laity, their"
1406,A BATTLE,respective duties. One William is represented as falling asleep among the
1407,A BATTLE,"Malvern Hills, and sees in his dream a succession of visions, in which"
1408,A BATTLE,"great ingenuity, great boldness, and here and there a powerful vein of"
1409,A BATTLE,"poetry, are displayed. Truth is described as a magnificent tower, and"
1410,A BATTLE,"Falsehood as a deep dungeon. In one canto Religion descends, and gives"
1411,A BATTLE,a long harangue about what should be the conduct of society and of
1412,A BATTLE,"individuals. Bribery and Falsehood, in another part of the poem, seek a"
1413,A BATTLE,"marriage with each other, and make their way to the courts of justice,"
1414,A BATTLE,where they find many friends. Some very whimsical passages are introduced.
1415,A BATTLE,"The Power of Grace confers upon Piers Plowman, who stands for the"
1416,A BATTLE,"Christian Life, four stout oxen, to cultivate the field of Truth. These"
1417,A BATTLE,"are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the last of whom is described as the"
1418,A BATTLE,gentlest of the team. She afterwards assigns him the like number of stots
1419,A BATTLE,"or bullocks, to harrow what the evangelists had ploughed, and this new"
1420,A BATTLE,"horned team consists of Saint or Stot Ambrose, Stot Austin, Stot Gregory,"
1421,A BATTLE,and Stot Jerome.
1422,A BATTLE,
1423,A BATTLE,"Apart from its fantastic structure, 'Piers Plowman' was not only a sign"
1424,A BATTLE,"of the times, but did great service in its day. His voice rings like"
1425,A BATTLE,that of Israel's minor prophets--like Nahum or Hosea--in a dark and
1426,A BATTLE,"corrupt age. He proclaims liberal and independent sentiments, he attacks"
1427,A BATTLE,"slavery and superstition, and he predicts the doom of the Papacy as with"
1428,A BATTLE,a thunder-knell. Chaucer must have felt roused to his share of the
1429,A BATTLE,reformatory work by the success of 'Piers Plowman;' Spenser is suspected
1430,A BATTLE,"to have read and borrowed from him; and even Milton, in his description"
1431,A BATTLE,"of a lazar-house in 'Paradise Lost,' had him probably in his eye. (See"
1432,A BATTLE,our last extract from 'Piers.')

2064,ADVERTISEMENT.,
2065,ADVERTISEMENT.,On a further examination of the material for 'Specimens and Memoirs of the
2066,ADVERTISEMENT.,"less-known British Poets,' it has been deemed advisable to devote three"
2067,ADVERTISEMENT.,"volumes to this _résumé_, and merely to give extracts from Cowley, instead"
2068,ADVERTISEMENT.,of following out the arrangement proposed when the issue for this year was
2069,ADVERTISEMENT.,announced. In this space it has been found possible to present the reader
2070,ADVERTISEMENT.,with specimens of almost all those authors whose writings were at any
2071,ADVERTISEMENT.,"period esteemed. The series will thus be rendered more perfect, and will"
2072,ADVERTISEMENT.,include the complete works of the authors whose entire writings are by
2073,ADVERTISEMENT.,a general verdict regarded as worthy of preservation; together with
2074,ADVERTISEMENT.,"representations of the style, and brief notices of the poets who have,"
2075,ADVERTISEMENT.,"during the progress of our literature, occupied a certain rank, but whose"
2076,ADVERTISEMENT.,popularity and importance have in a great measure passed.
2077,ADVERTISEMENT.,
2078,ADVERTISEMENT.,It is confidently hoped that the arrangements now made will give a
2079,ADVERTISEMENT.,completeness to the First Division of the Library Edition of the British
2080,ADVERTISEMENT.,Poets--from Chaucer to Cowper--which will be acceptable and satisfactory
2081,ADVERTISEMENT.,to the general reader.

2317,JOHN GOWER,
2318,JOHN GOWER,
2319,JOHN GOWER,Very little is told us (as usual in the beginnings of a literature) of
2320,JOHN GOWER,"the life and private history of Gower, and that little is not specially"
2321,JOHN GOWER,authentic or clearly consistent with itself. His life consists mainly of
2322,JOHN GOWER,"a series of suppositions, with one or two firm facts between--like a few"
2323,JOHN GOWER,stepping-stones insulated in wide spaces of water. He is said to have
2324,JOHN GOWER,"been born about the year 1325, and if so must have been a few years"
2325,JOHN GOWER,"older than Chaucer; whom he, however, outlived. He was a friend as well"
2326,JOHN GOWER,"as contemporary of that great poet, who, in the fifth book of his"
2327,JOHN GOWER,"'Troilus and Cresseide,' thus addresses him:--"
2328,JOHN GOWER,
2329,JOHN GOWER,"'O moral Gower, this bookë I direct,"
2330,JOHN GOWER,"To thee and the philosophical Strood,"
2331,JOHN GOWER,"To vouchsafe where need is to correct,"
2332,JOHN GOWER,Of your benignities and zealës good.'
2333,JOHN GOWER,
2334,JOHN GOWER,"Gower, on the other hand, in his 'Confessio Amantis,' through the mouth"
2335,JOHN GOWER,"of Venus, speaks as follows of Chaucer:--"
2336,JOHN GOWER,
2337,JOHN GOWER,"'And greet well Chaucer when ye meet,"
2338,JOHN GOWER,As my disciple and my poët;
2339,JOHN GOWER,"For 'in the flower of his youth,"
2340,JOHN GOWER,"In sundry wise, as he well couth,"
2341,JOHN GOWER,"Of ditties and of songës glad,"
2342,JOHN GOWER,"The whichë for my sake he made,"
2343,JOHN GOWER,"The laud fulfill'd is over all,' &c."
2344,JOHN GOWER,
2345,JOHN GOWER,The place of Gower's birth has been the subject of much controversy.
2346,JOHN GOWER,"Caxton asserts that he was a native of Wales. Leland, Bales, Pits,"
2347,JOHN GOWER,"Hollingshed, and Edmondson contend, on the other hand, that he belonged"
2348,JOHN GOWER,"to the Statenham family, in Yorkshire. In proof of this, a deed is"
2349,JOHN GOWER,"appealed to, which is preserved among the ancient records of the Marquis"
2350,JOHN GOWER,"of Stafford. To this deed, of which the local date is Statenham, and the"
2351,JOHN GOWER,"chronological 1346, one of the subscribing witnesses is _John Gower_ who"
2352,JOHN GOWER,"on the back of the deed is stated, in the handwriting of at least a"
2353,JOHN GOWER,"century later, to be '_Sr John Gower the Poet_'. Whatever may be thought"
2354,JOHN GOWER,"of this piece of evidence, 'the proud tradition,' adds Todd, who had"
2355,JOHN GOWER,"produced it, 'in the Marquis of Stafford's family has been, and still"
2356,JOHN GOWER,"is, that the poet was of Statenham; and who would not consider the"
2357,JOHN GOWER,dignity of his genealogy augmented by enrolling among its worthies the
2358,JOHN GOWER,moral Gower?'
2359,JOHN GOWER,
2360,JOHN GOWER,"From his will we know that he possessed the manor of Southwell, in the"
2361,JOHN GOWER,"county of Nottingham, and that of Multon, in the county of Suffolk. He"
2362,JOHN GOWER,"was thus a rich man, as well as probably a knight. The latter fact is"
2363,JOHN GOWER,inferred from the circumstance of his effigies in the church of St Mary
2364,JOHN GOWER,"Overies wearing a chaplet of roses, such as, says Francis Thynne, 'the"
2365,JOHN GOWER,"knyghtes in old time used, either of gold or other embroiderye, made"
2366,JOHN GOWER,"after the fashion of roses, one of the peculiar ornamentes of a knighte,"
2367,JOHN GOWER,"as well as his collar of S.S.S., his guilte sword and spurres. Which"
2368,JOHN GOWER,"chaplett or circle of roses was as well attributed to knyghtes, the"
2369,JOHN GOWER,"lowest degree of honor, as to the higher degrees of duke, erle, &c.,"
2370,JOHN GOWER,"being knyghtes, for so I have seen John of Gaunte pictured in his"
2371,JOHN GOWER,"chaplett of roses; and King, Edwarde the Thirde gave his chaplett to"
2372,JOHN GOWER,"Eustace Rybamonte; only the difference was, that as they were of lower"
2373,JOHN GOWER,"degree, so had they fewer roses placed on their chaplett or cyrcle of"
2374,JOHN GOWER,"golde, one ornament deduced from the dukes crowne, which had the roses"
2375,JOHN GOWER,"upon the top of the cyrcle, when the knights had them only upon the"
2376,JOHN GOWER,cyrcle or garlande itself.'
2377,JOHN GOWER,
2378,JOHN GOWER,It has been said that Gower as well as Chaucer studied in the Temple.
2379,JOHN GOWER,"This, however, Thynne doubts, on the ground that 'it is most certeyn"
2380,JOHN GOWER,to be gathered by cyrcumstances of recordes that the lawyers were not
2381,JOHN GOWER,in the Temple until towardes the latter parte of the reygne of Kinge
2382,JOHN GOWER,"Edwarde the Thirde, at whiche tyme Chaucer was a grave manne, holden in"
2383,JOHN GOWER,"greate credyt and employed in embassye;' and when, of course, Gower,"
2384,JOHN GOWER,"being his senior, must have been 'graver' still."
2385,JOHN GOWER,
2386,JOHN GOWER,There is scarcely anything more to relate of the personal career of our
2387,JOHN GOWER,"poet. In his elder days he became attached to the House of Lancaster,"
2388,JOHN GOWER,"under Thomas of Woodstock, as Chaucer did under John of Gaunt. It is"
2389,JOHN GOWER,"said that the two poets, who had been warm friends, at last quarrelled,"
2390,JOHN GOWER,"but obscurity rests on the cause, the circumstances, the duration, and"
2391,JOHN GOWER,"the consequences of the dispute. Gower, like some far greater bards,"
2392,JOHN GOWER,"--Milton for instance, and those whom Milton has commemorated,"
2393,JOHN GOWER,
2394,JOHN GOWER,"'Blind Thamyris and blind Moeonides,"
2395,JOHN GOWER,"And Tiresiaa and Phineus, prophets old,'--"
2396,JOHN GOWER,
2397,JOHN GOWER,"was sometime ere his death deprived of his sight, as we know on his own"
2398,JOHN GOWER,"authority. It appears from his will that he was still living in 1408,"
2399,JOHN GOWER,having outlived Chaucer eight years. This will is a curious document.
2400,JOHN GOWER,"It is that of a very rich and very superstitious Catholic, who leaves"
2401,JOHN GOWER,"bequests to churches, hospitals, to priors, sub-priors, and priests,"
2402,JOHN GOWER,"with the significant request '_ut orent pro me_'--a request which, for"
2403,JOHN GOWER,"the sake of the poor soul of the 'moral Gower,' was we trust devoutly"
2404,JOHN GOWER,"obeyed, although we are irresistibly reminded of the old rhyme,"
2405,JOHN GOWER,
2406,JOHN GOWER,"'Pray for the soul of Gabriel John,"
2407,JOHN GOWER,Who died in the year one thousand and one;
2408,JOHN GOWER,"You may if you please, or let it alone,"
2409,JOHN GOWER,For it's all one
2410,JOHN GOWER,"To Gabriel John,"
2411,JOHN GOWER,Who died in the year one thousand and one.'
2412,JOHN GOWER,
2413,JOHN GOWER,"There is no mention of children in the will, and hence the assertion of"
2414,JOHN GOWER,"Edmondson, who, in his genealogical table of the Statenham family, says"
2415,JOHN GOWER,"that Thomas Gower, the governor of the castle of Mans in the times of"
2416,JOHN GOWER,"the Fifth and Sixth Henrys, was the only son of the poet, and that of"
2417,JOHN GOWER,"Glover, who, in his 'Visitation of Yorkshire,' describes Gower as"
2418,JOHN GOWER,"married to a lady named Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward Sadbowrughe,"
2419,JOHN GOWER,"Baron of the Exchequer, by whom he had five sons and three daughters,"
2420,JOHN GOWER,"must both fall to the ground. According to the will, Gower's wife's name"
2421,JOHN GOWER,"was Agnes, and he leaves to her £100 in legacy, besides his valuable"
2422,JOHN GOWER,"goods and the rents accruing from his aforesaid manors of Multon, in"
2423,JOHN GOWER,"Suffolk, and Southwell, in Nottinghamshire. His body was, according"
2424,JOHN GOWER,"to his own direction, buried in the monastery of St Mary Overies, in"
2425,JOHN GOWER,"Southwark, (afterwards the church of St Saviour,) where a monument, and"
2426,JOHN GOWER,"an effigies, too, were erected, with the roses of a knight girdling the"
2427,JOHN GOWER,"brow of one who was unquestionably a true, if not a great poet."
2428,JOHN GOWER,
2429,JOHN GOWER,"In Warton's 'History of English Poetry,' and in the 'Illustrations of"
2430,JOHN GOWER,"the Lives and Writings of Gower and Chaucer' by Mr Todd, there will be"
2431,JOHN GOWER,"found ample and curious details about MS. poems by Gower, such as fifty"
2432,JOHN GOWER,"sonnets in French; a 'Panegyrick on Henry IV.,' half in Latin and half"
2433,JOHN GOWER,"in English, a short elegiac poem on the same subject, &c.; besides a"
2434,JOHN GOWER,"large work, entitled 'Speculum Meditantis,' a poem in French of a moral"
2435,JOHN GOWER,"cast; and 'Vox Clamantis,' consisting of seven books of Latin elegiacs,"
2436,JOHN GOWER,and chiefly filled with a metrical account of the insurrections of the
2437,JOHN GOWER,Commons in the reign of Richard II. In the dedication of this latter
2438,JOHN GOWER,"work to Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, Gower speaks of his blindness"
2439,JOHN GOWER,"and his age. He says, 'Hanc epistolam subscriptam corde devoto misit"
2440,JOHN GOWER,_senex et cecus_ Johannes Gower reverendissimo in Christo patri ac
2441,JOHN GOWER,"domino suo precipuo domino Thome de Arundell, Cantuar. Archiepö.' &c."
2442,JOHN GOWER,"Warton proves that the 'Vox Clamantis' was written in the year 1397, by"
2443,JOHN GOWER,"a line in the Bodleian manuscript of the poem, 'Hos ego _bis deno_"
2444,JOHN GOWER,"Ricardo regis in anno.' Richard II. began, it is well known, to reign in"
2445,JOHN GOWER,"the year 1377, when ten years of age, and, of course, the year 1397 was"
2446,JOHN GOWER,"the twentieth of his reign. It follows from this, that for eleven years"
2447,JOHN GOWER,"at least before his death Gower had been _senex et cecus_, helpless"
2448,JOHN GOWER,through old age and blindness.
2449,JOHN GOWER,
2450,JOHN GOWER,The 'Confessio Amantis' is the only work of Gower's which is printed and
2451,JOHN GOWER,in English. The rest are still slumbering in MS.; and even although the
2452,JOHN GOWER,'Vox Clamantis' should put in a sleepy plea for the resurrection of
2453,JOHN GOWER,"print, on the whole we are disposed to say, better for all parties that"
2454,JOHN GOWER,it and the rest should slumber on. But the 'Confessio Amantis' is
2455,JOHN GOWER,altogether a remarkable production. It is said to have been written at
2456,JOHN GOWER,"the command of Richard II., who, meeting our poet rowing on the Thames,"
2457,JOHN GOWER,"near London, took him on board the royal barge, and requested him to"
2458,JOHN GOWER,"_book some new thing_. It is an English poem, in eight books, and was"
2459,JOHN GOWER,"first printed by Caxton in the year 1483. The 'Speculum Meditantis,'"
2460,JOHN GOWER,"'Vox Clamantis,' and 'Confessio Amantis,' are, properly speaking, parts"
2461,JOHN GOWER,"of one great work, and are represented by three volumes upon Gower's"
2462,JOHN GOWER,curious tomb in the old conventual church of St Mary Overies already
2463,JOHN GOWER,"alluded to--a church, by the way, which the poet himself assisted in"
2464,JOHN GOWER,rebuilding in the elegant shape which it retains to this day.
2465,JOHN GOWER,
2466,JOHN GOWER,"The 'Confessio' is a large unwieldy collection of poetry and prose,"
2467,JOHN GOWER,"superstition and science, love and religion, allegory and historical"
2468,JOHN GOWER,"facts. It is crammed with all varieties of learning, and a perverse but"
2469,JOHN GOWER,infinite ingenuity is shewn in the arrangement of its heterogeneous
2470,JOHN GOWER,materials. In one book the whole mysteries of the Hermetic philosophy
2471,JOHN GOWER,"are expounded, and the wonders of alchymy dazzle us in every page."
2472,JOHN GOWER,"In another, the poet scales the heights and sounds the depths of"
2473,JOHN GOWER,Aristotelianism. From this we have extracted in the 'Specimens' a
2474,JOHN GOWER,"glowing account of 'The Chariot of the Sun.' Throughout the work, tales"
2475,JOHN GOWER,and stories of every description and degree of merit are interspersed.
2476,JOHN GOWER,"These are principally derived from an old book called 'Pantheon; or,"
2477,JOHN GOWER,"Memoriae Seculorum,'--a kind of universal history, more studious of"
2478,JOHN GOWER,"effect than accuracy, in which the author ranges over the whole history"
2479,JOHN GOWER,"of the world, from the creation down to the year 1186. This was a"
2480,JOHN GOWER,"specimen of a kind of writing in which the Middle Ages abounded--namely,"
2481,JOHN GOWER,"chronicles, which gradually superseded the monkish legends, and for"
2482,JOHN GOWER,a time eclipsed the classics themselves; a kind of writing hovering
2483,JOHN GOWER,"between history and fiction, embracing the widest sweep, written in a"
2484,JOHN GOWER,"barbarous style, and swarming with falsehoods; but exciting, interesting,"
2485,JOHN GOWER,"and often instructive, and tending to kindle curiosity, and"
2486,JOHN GOWER,create in the minds of their readers a love for literature.
2487,JOHN GOWER,
2488,JOHN GOWER,"Besides chronicles, Gower had read many romances, and alludes to them"
2489,JOHN GOWER,in various parts of his works. His 'Confessio Amantis' was apparently
2490,JOHN GOWER,"written after Chaucer's 'Troilus and Cresseide,' and after 'The Flower"
2491,JOHN GOWER,"and the Leaf,' inasmuch as he speaks of the one and imitates the other"
2492,JOHN GOWER,"in that poem. That Chaucer had not, however, yet composed his 'Testament"
2493,JOHN GOWER,"of Love,' appears from the epilogue to the 'Confessio,' where Gower is"
2494,JOHN GOWER,"ordered by Venus, who expresses admiration of Chaucer for the early"
2495,JOHN GOWER,"devotion of his muse to her service, to say to him at the close--"
2496,JOHN GOWER,
2497,JOHN GOWER,"'Forthy, now in his daies old,"
2498,JOHN GOWER,"Thou shalt him tell this message,"
2499,JOHN GOWER,That he upon his later age
2500,JOHN GOWER,"To set an end of all his work,"
2501,JOHN GOWER,"As he which is mine owen clerk,"
2502,JOHN GOWER,"Do make his Testament of Love,"
2503,JOHN GOWER,"As thou hast done thy shrift above,"
2504,JOHN GOWER,So that my court it may record'--
2505,JOHN GOWER,
2506,JOHN GOWER,the 'shrift' being of course the 'Confessio Amantis.' In 'The Canterbury
2507,JOHN GOWER,Tales' there are several indications that Chaucer was indebted to Gower
2508,JOHN GOWER,"--'The Man of Law's Tale' being borrowed from Gower's 'Constantia,' and"
2509,JOHN GOWER,'The Wife of Bath's Tale' being founded on Gower's 'Florent.'
2510,JOHN GOWER,
2511,JOHN GOWER,"After all, Gower cannot be classed with the greater bards. He sparkles"
2512,JOHN GOWER,brightly chiefly from the depth of the darkness through which he shines.
2513,JOHN GOWER,"He is more remarkable for extent than for depth, for solidity than for"
2514,JOHN GOWER,"splendour, for fuel than for fire, for learning than for genius."

2839,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2840,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2841,JOHN BARBOUR.,The facts known about this Scottish poet are only the following. He
2842,JOHN BARBOUR.,"seems to have been born about the year 1316, in, probably, the city of"
2843,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen. This is stated by Hume of Godscroft, by Dr Mackenzie, and"
2844,JOHN BARBOUR.,"others, but is not thoroughly authenticated. Some think he was the son"
2845,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of one Andrew Barbour, who possessed a tenement in Castle Street,"
2846,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen; and others, that he was related to one Robert Barbour, who, in"
2847,JOHN BARBOUR.,"1309, received a charter of the lands of Craigie, in Forfarshire, from"
2848,JOHN BARBOUR.,"King Robert the Bruce. These, however, are mere conjectures, founded"
2849,JOHN BARBOUR.,"upon a similarity of name. It is clear, from Barbour's after rank in"
2850,JOHN BARBOUR.,"the Church, that he had received a learned education, but whether in"
2851,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Arbroath or Aberdeen is uncertain. We know, however, that a school of"
2852,JOHN BARBOUR.,divinity and canon law had existed at Aberdeen since the reign of
2853,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Alexander II., and it is conjectured that Barbour first studied there,"
2854,JOHN BARBOUR.,"and then at Oxford. In the year 1357, he was undoubtedly Archdeacon of"
2855,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen, since we find him, under this title, nominated by the Bishop"
2856,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of that diocese, one of the Commissioners appointed to meet in Edinburgh"
2857,JOHN BARBOUR.,"to take measures to liberate King David, who had been captured at the"
2858,JOHN BARBOUR.,"battle of Nevil's Cross, and detained from that date in England. It"
2859,JOHN BARBOUR.,"seems evident, from the customs of the Roman Catholic Church, that he"
2860,JOHN BARBOUR.,"must have been at least forty when he was created Archdeacon, and this"
2861,JOHN BARBOUR.,is a good reason for fixing his birth in the year 1316.
2862,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2863,JOHN BARBOUR.,"In the same year, Barbour obtained permission from Edward III., at the"
2864,JOHN BARBOUR.,"request of the Scottish King, to travel through England with three"
2865,JOHN BARBOUR.,"scholars who were to study at Oxford, probably at Balliol College, which"
2866,JOHN BARBOUR.,"had, a hundred years nearly before, been founded and endowed by the wife"
2867,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of the famous John Balliol of Scotland. Some years afterwards, in"
2868,JOHN BARBOUR.,"November 1364, he got permission to pass, accompanied by four horsemen,"
2869,JOHN BARBOUR.,"through England, to pursue his studies at the same renowned university."
2870,JOHN BARBOUR.,"In the year 1365, we find another casual notice of our Scottish bard. A"
2871,JOHN BARBOUR.,passport has been found giving him permission from the King of England
2872,JOHN BARBOUR.,"to travel, in company with six horsemen, through that country on their"
2873,JOHN BARBOUR.,"way to St Denis', and other sacred places. It is evident that this was"
2874,JOHN BARBOUR.,a religious pilgrimage on the part of Barbour and his companions.

2876,JOHN BARBOUR.,"A most peripatetic poet; verily, he must have been; for we find another"
2877,JOHN BARBOUR.,"safe-conduct, dated November 1368, granted by Edward to Barbour,"
2878,JOHN BARBOUR.,"permitting him, to pass through England, with two servants and their"
2879,JOHN BARBOUR.,"horses, on his way to France, for the purpose of pursuing his studies"
2880,JOHN BARBOUR.,there. Dr Jamieson (see his 'Life of Barbour') discovers the poet's name
2881,JOHN BARBOUR.,in the list of Auditors of the Exchequer.
2882,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2883,JOHN BARBOUR.,Barbour has himself told us that he commenced his poem in the 'yer of
2884,JOHN BARBOUR.,"grace, a thousand thre hundyr sevynty and five,' when, of course, he"
2885,JOHN BARBOUR.,"was in his sixtieth year, or, as he says, 'off hys eld sexty.' It is"
2886,JOHN BARBOUR.,supposed that David II.--who died in 1370--had urged Barbour to engage
2887,JOHN BARBOUR.,"in the work, which was not, however, completed till the fifth year of"
2888,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his successor, Robert II., who gave our poet a pension on account of it."
2889,JOHN BARBOUR.,This consisted of a sum of ten pounds Scots from the revenues of the
2890,JOHN BARBOUR.,"city of Aberdeen, and twenty shillings from the burgh mails. Mr James"
2891,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce, to whose interesting Life of Barbour, in his 'Eminent Men of"
2892,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen,' we are indebted for many of the facts in this narrative,"
2893,JOHN BARBOUR.,"says, 'The latter of these sums was granted to him, not merely during"
2894,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his own life, but to his assignees; and the Archdeacon bequeathed it to"
2895,JOHN BARBOUR.,"the dean, canons, the chapter, and other ministers of the Cathedral of"
2896,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen, on condition that they should for ever celebrate a yearly mass"
2897,JOHN BARBOUR.,"for his soul. At the Reformation, when it came to be discovered that"
2898,JOHN BARBOUR.,"masses did no good to souls in the other world, it is probable that this"
2899,JOHN BARBOUR.,endowment reverted to the Crown.'
2900,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2901,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Barbour also wrote a poem under what seems now the strange title, 'The"
2902,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Brute.' This was in reality a metrical history of Scotland, commencing"
2903,JOHN BARBOUR.,"with the fables concerning Brutus, or 'Brute,' who, according to ancient"
2904,JOHN BARBOUR.,"legends, was the great-grandson of Aeneas--came over from Italy, the"
2905,JOHN BARBOUR.,"land of his birth--landed at Totness, in Devonshire--destroyed the"
2906,JOHN BARBOUR.,giants who then inhabited Albion--called the island 'Britain' from his
2907,JOHN BARBOUR.,"own name, and became its first monarch. From this original fable,"
2908,JOHN BARBOUR.,Barbour is supposed to have wandered on through a hundred succeeding
2909,JOHN BARBOUR.,"stories of similar value, till he came down to his own day. There can be"
2910,JOHN BARBOUR.,"little regret felt, therefore, that the book is totally lost. Wynton, in"
2911,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his 'Chronicle,' refers to it in commendatory terms; but it cannot be"
2912,JOHN BARBOUR.,ascertained from his notices whether it was composed in Scotch or in
2913,JOHN BARBOUR.,Latin.
2914,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2915,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Barbour died about the beginning of the year 1396, eighty years of age."
2916,JOHN BARBOUR.,Lord Hailes ascertained the time of his death from the Chartulary of
2917,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Aberdeen, where, under the date of 10th August 1398, mention is made of"
2918,JOHN BARBOUR.,"'quondam Joh. Barber, Archidiaconus, Aberd., and where it is said that"
2919,JOHN BARBOUR.,"he had died two years and a half before, namely, in 1396.'"
2920,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2921,JOHN BARBOUR.,"His great work, 'The Bruce,' or more fully, 'The History of Robert"
2922,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce, King of the Scots,' does not appear to have been printed till"
2923,JOHN BARBOUR.,"1616 in Edinburgh. Between that date and the year 1790, when Pinkerton's"
2924,JOHN BARBOUR.,"edition appeared, no less than twenty impressions were published, (the"
2925,JOHN BARBOUR.,"principal being those of Edinburgh in 1620 and 1648; Glasgow, 1665; and"
2926,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Edinburgh, 1670--all in black letter,) so popular immediately became the"
2927,JOHN BARBOUR.,"poem. Pinkerton's edition is in three volumes, and has a preface, notes,"
2928,JOHN BARBOUR.,"and a glossary, all of considerable value. The MS. was copied from a"
2929,JOHN BARBOUR.,"volume in the Advocates' Library, of the date of 1489, which was in the"
2930,JOHN BARBOUR.,"handwriting of one John Ramsay, believed to have been the prior of a"
2931,JOHN BARBOUR.,Carthusian monastery near Perth. Pinkerton first divided 'The Bruce'
2932,JOHN BARBOUR.,"into books. It had previously, like the long works of Naerius and"
2933,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Ennius, the earliest Roman poets, consisted of one entire piece, woven"
2934,JOHN BARBOUR.,"'from the top to the bottom without seam,' like the ancient simple"
2935,JOHN BARBOUR.,"garments in Jewry. The late respectable and very learned Dr Jamieson, of"
2936,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Nicolson Street United Secession Church, Edinburgh, well known as the"
2937,JOHN BARBOUR.,"author of the 'Scottish Dictionary,' 'Hermes Scythicus,' &c., published,"
2938,JOHN BARBOUR.,"in 1820, a more accurate edition of 'The Bruce,' along with Blind"
2939,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Harry's 'Wallace,' in two quarto volumes."
2940,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2941,JOHN BARBOUR.,"In strict chronology Barbour belongs to an earlier date than Chaucer,"
2942,JOHN BARBOUR.,having been born and having died a few years before him. But as the
2943,JOHN BARBOUR.,"first Scotch poet who has written anything of length, with the exception"
2944,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of the author of the 'Romance of Sir Tristrem,' he claims a conspicuous"
2945,JOHN BARBOUR.,place in our 'Specimens.' He was singularly fortunate in the choice of
2946,JOHN BARBOUR.,"a subject. With the exception of Wallace, there is no name in Scottish"
2947,JOHN BARBOUR.,history that even yet calls up prouder associations than that of Robert
2948,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce. The incidents in his history,--the escape he made from English"
2949,JOHN BARBOUR.,bondage to rescue his country from the same yoke; his rise refulgent
2950,JOHN BARBOUR.,"from the stroke which, in the cloisters of the Gray Friars, Dumfries,"
2951,JOHN BARBOUR.,laid the Red Comyn low; his daring to be crowned at Scone; his frequent
2952,JOHN BARBOUR.,"defeats; his lion-like retreat to the Hebrides, accompanied by one or"
2953,JOHN BARBOUR.,"two friends, his wife meanwhile having been carried captive, three of"
2954,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his brothers hanged, and himself supposed to be dead; the romantic"
2955,JOHN BARBOUR.,"perils he survived, and the victories he gained amidst the mountains"
2956,JOHN BARBOUR.,"where the deep waters of the river Awe are still telling of his name,"
2957,JOHN BARBOUR.,and the echoes of Ben Cruachan repeating the immortal sound; his sudden
2958,JOHN BARBOUR.,"reappearance on the west coast of Scotland, where, as he 'shook his"
2959,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Carrick spear,' his country rose, kindling around him like heather on"
2960,JOHN BARBOUR.,flame; the awful suspense of the hour when it was announced that Edward
2961,JOHN BARBOUR.,"I., the tyrant of the Ragman's Roll, the murderer of Wallace, was"
2962,JOHN BARBOUR.,approaching with a mighty army to crush the revolt; the electrifying
2963,JOHN BARBOUR.,"news that he had died at Sark, as if struck by the breath of the fatal"
2964,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Border, which he had reached, but could not overpass; the bloody"
2965,JOHN BARBOUR.,"summer's day of Bannockburn, in which Edward II. was repelled, and the"
2966,JOHN BARBOUR.,gallant army of his father annihilated; the energy and wisdom of the
2967,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce's civil administration after the victory; the less famous, but"
2968,JOHN BARBOUR.,"noble battle of Byland, nine years after Bannockburn, in which he again"
2969,JOHN BARBOUR.,smote the foes of his country; and the recognition which at last he
2970,JOHN BARBOUR.,"procured, on the accession of Edward III., of the independence of"
2971,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Scotland in 1329, himself dying the same year, his work done and his"
2972,JOHN BARBOUR.,"glory for ever secured,--not to speak of the beautiful legends which"
2973,JOHN BARBOUR.,have clustered round his history like ivy round an ancestral tower--of
2974,JOHN BARBOUR.,"the spider on the wall, teaching him the lesson of perseverance, as he"
2975,JOHN BARBOUR.,lay in the barn sad and desponding in heart--of the strange signal-light
2976,JOHN BARBOUR.,"upon the shore near his maternal castle of Turnberry, which led him to"
2977,JOHN BARBOUR.,"land, while"
2978,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2979,JOHN BARBOUR.,"'Dark red the heaven above it glow'd,"
2980,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Dark red the sea beneath it flow'd,"
2981,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Red rose the rocks on ocean's brim,"
2982,JOHN BARBOUR.,"In blood-red light her islets swim,"
2983,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Wild screams the dazzled sea-fowl gave,"
2984,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Dropp'd from their crags a plashing wave,"
2985,JOHN BARBOUR.,"The deer to distant covert drew,"
2986,JOHN BARBOUR.,"The blackcock deem'd it day, and crew;'"
2987,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2988,JOHN BARBOUR.,"and last, not least, the adventures of his gallant, unquenchable heart,"
2989,JOHN BARBOUR.,"when, in the hand of Douglas,--meet casket for such a gem!--it marched"
2990,JOHN BARBOUR.,"onwards, as it was wont to do, in conquering power, toward the Holy"
2991,JOHN BARBOUR.,Land;--all this has woven a garland round the brow of Bruce which every
2992,JOHN BARBOUR.,"civilised nation has delighted to honour, and given him besides a share"
2993,JOHN BARBOUR.,"in the affections and the pride of his own land, with the joy of which"
2994,JOHN BARBOUR.,'no stranger can intermeddle.'
2995,JOHN BARBOUR.,
2996,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bruce has been fortunate in his laureates, consisting of three of"
2997,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Scotland's greatest poets,--Barbour, Scott, and Burns. The last of these"
2998,JOHN BARBOUR.,"has given us a glimpse of the patriot-king, revealing him on the brow of"
2999,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Bannockburn as by a single flash of lightning. The second has, in 'The"
3000,JOHN BARBOUR.,"Lord of the Isles,' seized and sung a few of the more romantic passages"
3001,JOHN BARBOUR.,"of his history. But Barbour has, with unwearied fidelity and no small"
3002,JOHN BARBOUR.,"force, described the whole incidents of Bruce's career, and reared to"
3003,JOHN BARBOUR.,"his memory, not an insulated column, but a broad and deep-set temple of"
3004,JOHN BARBOUR.,poetry.
3005,JOHN BARBOUR.,
3006,JOHN BARBOUR.,Barbour's poem has always been admired for its strict accuracy of
3007,JOHN BARBOUR.,"statement, to which Bower, Wynton, Hailes, Pinkerton, Jamieson, and Sir"
3008,JOHN BARBOUR.,Walter Scott all bear testimony; for the picturesque force of its
3009,JOHN BARBOUR.,"natural descriptions; for its insight into character, and the lifelike"
3010,JOHN BARBOUR.,spirit of its individual sketches; for the martial vigour of its battle-
3011,JOHN BARBOUR.,"pictures; for the enthusiasm which he feels, and makes his reader feel,"
3012,JOHN BARBOUR.,"for the valiant and wise, the sagacious and persevering, the bold,"
3013,JOHN BARBOUR.,"merciful, and religious character of its hero, and for the piety which"
3014,JOHN BARBOUR.,"pervades it, and proves that the author was not merely a churchman in"
3015,JOHN BARBOUR.,"profession, but a Christian at heart. Its defects of rude rhythm,"
3016,JOHN BARBOUR.,"irregular constructions, and obsolete phraseology, are those of its age;"
3017,JOHN BARBOUR.,"but its beauties, its unflagging interest, and its fine poetic spirit,"
3018,JOHN BARBOUR.,are characteristic of the writer's own genius.

3142,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"This author, who was prior of St Serf's monastery in Loch Leven, is the"
3143,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,author of what he calls 'An Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland.' It appeared
3144,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,about the year 1420. It is much inferior to the work of Barbour in
3145,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"poetry, but is full of historical information, anecdote, and legend. The"
3146,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,language is often sufficiently prosaic. Thus the poet begins to describe
3147,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"the return of King David II. from his captivity, referred to above."
3148,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,
3149,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"'Yet in prison was king Davy,"

3158,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"Contemporary, or nearly so, with Wyntoun were several other Scottish"

3160,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"designated of the 'Awle Ryall,' or of the Royal Hall or Palace, and that"
3161,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"he wrote a metrical romance, of which two cantos remain, called 'The"
3162,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"Gest of Arthur;' and another, named Clerk of Tranent, the author of a"
3163,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"romance, entitled 'The Adventures of Sir Gawain.' Of this latter also"
3164,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,two cantos only are extant. Although not perhaps deserving to have even
3165,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"portions of them extracted, they contain a good deal of poetry. A"
3166,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"person, too, of the name of Holland, about whose history we have no"
3167,ANDREW WYNTOUN.,"information, produced a satirical poem, called 'The Howlate,' written in"

3177,BLIND HARRY.,Although there are diversities of opinion as to the exact time when this
3178,BLIND HARRY.,"blind minstrel flourished, we prefer alluding to him at this point,"
3179,BLIND HARRY.,"where he stands in close proximity to Barbour, the author of a poem on"
3180,BLIND HARRY.,a subject so cognate to 'Wallace' as 'Bruce.' Nothing is known of Harry
3181,BLIND HARRY.,"but that he was blind from infancy, that he composed this poem, and"
3182,BLIND HARRY.,gained a subsistence by reciting or singing portions of it through the
3183,BLIND HARRY.,"country. Another Wandering Willie, (see 'Redgauntlet,') he 'passed like"
3184,BLIND HARRY.,"night from land to land,' led by his own instincts, and wherever he met"
3185,BLIND HARRY.,"with a congenial audience, he proceeded to chant portions of the noble"
3186,BLIND HARRY.,"knight's achievements, his eyes the while twinkling, through their sad"
3187,BLIND HARRY.,"setting of darkness, with enthusiasm, and often suffused with tears."
3188,BLIND HARRY.,In some minds the conception of this blind wandering bard may awaken
3189,BLIND HARRY.,"ludicrous emotions, but to us it suggests a certain sublimity. Blind"
3190,BLIND HARRY.,Harry has powerfully described Wallace standing in the light and

3193,BLIND HARRY.,"light of the ghost of Wallace, and it ministers to him, not terror, but"
3194,BLIND HARRY.,"inspiration. Entering a cot at night, and asked for a tale, he begins,"
3195,BLIND HARRY.,"in low tones, to recite that frightful apparition at Gaskhall, and the"
3196,BLIND HARRY.,aged men and the crones vie with the children in drawing near the 'ingle

3200,BLIND HARRY.,"That haill hall he had set into a fire,"

3203,BLIND HARRY.,"Arriving in a village at the hour of morning rest and refreshment, he"

3209,BLIND HARRY.,High in the sphere the signs he made declare.

3212,BLIND HARRY.,
3213,BLIND HARRY.,and the simple villagers wonder at hearing these images from one who is
3214,BLIND HARRY.,"blind, not seeing the sun. As the leaves are rustling down from the"
3215,BLIND HARRY.,"ruddy trees of late autumn, he sings to a little circle of wayside"

3229,BLIND HARRY.,"and about to set as if for ever, then is the Minstrel's voice heard"

3231,BLIND HARRY.,went down while it was yet day.

3236,BLIND HARRY.,With a bauld sprite guid Wallace blent about.'
3237,BLIND HARRY.,
3238,BLIND HARRY.,"There can be little doubt that Blind Harry, during his lifetime, became"
3239,BLIND HARRY.,"a favourite, nay, a power in the realm. Wherever he circulated, there"
3240,BLIND HARRY.,"circulated the fame of Wallace; there, his deeds were recounted; there,"
3241,BLIND HARRY.,"hatred of a foreign foe, and love to their native land, were inculcated"
3242,BLIND HARRY.,as first principles; and long after the Homer of Scotland had breathed
3243,BLIND HARRY.,"his last, and been consigned perhaps to some little kirkyard among the"
3244,BLIND HARRY.,"uplands, his lays continued to live; and we know that such a man as"
3245,BLIND HARRY.,Burns (who read them in the modern paraphrase of William Hamilton of
3246,BLIND HARRY.,"Gilbertfield, a book which was, till within a somewhat recent period,"
3247,BLIND HARRY.,a household god in the libraries of the Scotch) derived from the old
3248,BLIND HARRY.,singer much of 'that national prejudice which boiled in his breast till
3249,BLIND HARRY.,"the floodgates of life shut in eternal rest.' If Barbour, as we said,"
3250,BLIND HARRY.,"was fortunate in his subject, still more was Blind Harry in his. The"
3251,BLIND HARRY.,interest felt in Wallace is of a deeper and warmer kind than that which
3252,BLIND HARRY.,we feel in Bruce. Bruce was of royal blood; Wallace was from an ancient
3253,BLIND HARRY.,but not wealthy family. Bruce stained his career by one great crime
3254,BLIND HARRY.,"--great in itself, but greater from the peculiar notions of the age"
3255,BLIND HARRY.,--the murder of Comyn in the sanctuary of Dumfries; on the character of
3256,BLIND HARRY.,Wallace no similar imputation rests. Wallace initiated that plan of
3257,BLIND HARRY.,"guerilla warfare,--that fighting now on foot and now on the wing, now"
3258,BLIND HARRY.,"with beak and now with talons, now with horns and now with hoofs,--which"
3259,BLIND HARRY.,"Bruce had only to perfect. Wallace was unsuccessful, and was besides"
3260,BLIND HARRY.,treated by the King of England with revolting barbarity; while Bruce
3261,BLIND HARRY.,"became victorious: and, as we saw in our remarks on Chaucer, it is the"
3262,BLIND HARRY.,unfortunate brave who stamp themselves most forcibly on a nation's
3263,BLIND HARRY.,"heart, and it is the red letters, which tell of suffering and death,"
3264,BLIND HARRY.,which are with most difficulty erased from a nation's tablets. On Bruce
3265,BLIND HARRY.,"we look somewhat as we regard Washington,--a great, serene man, who,"
3266,BLIND HARRY.,"after long reverses, nobly sustained, gained a notable national triumph;"
3267,BLIND HARRY.,"to Wallace we feel, as the Italians do to Garibaldi, as a demon of"
3268,BLIND HARRY.,"warlike power,--blending courage and clemency, enthusiasm and skill,"
3269,BLIND HARRY.,"daring and determination, in proportions almost superhuman,--and we cry"
3270,BLIND HARRY.,"with the poet,"
3271,BLIND HARRY.,
3272,BLIND HARRY.,"'The sword that seem'd fit for archangel to wield,"
3273,BLIND HARRY.,Was light in his terrible hand.'
3274,BLIND HARRY.,
3275,BLIND HARRY.,"We have often regretted that Sir Walter Scott, who, after all, has not"
3276,BLIND HARRY.,done full justice to Bruce in that very unequal and incondite poem 'The
3277,BLIND HARRY.,"Lord of the Isles,' had not bent his strength upon the Ulysses bow of"
3278,BLIND HARRY.,"Wallace, and filled up that splendid sketch of a part of his history to"
3279,BLIND HARRY.,"be found near the beginning of 'The Fair Maid of Perth.' As it is, after"
3280,BLIND HARRY.,"all that a number of respectable writers, such as Miss Porter, Mrs"
3281,BLIND HARRY.,"Hemans, Findlay, the late Mr Macpherson of Glasgow, and others, have"
3282,BLIND HARRY.,"done--in prose or verse, in the novel, the poem, or the drama--to"
3283,BLIND HARRY.,"illustrate the character and career of the Scottish hero, Blind Harry"
3284,BLIND HARRY.,remains his poet.
3285,BLIND HARRY.,
3286,BLIND HARRY.,"It is necessary to notice that Harry derived, by his own account, many"
3287,BLIND HARRY.,"of the facts of his narrative from a work by John Blair, a Benedictine"
3288,BLIND HARRY.,"monk from Dundee, who acted as Wallace's chaplain, and seems to have"
3289,BLIND HARRY.,"composed a life of him in Latin, which is lost. Besides these, he"
3290,BLIND HARRY.,"doubtless mingled in the story a number of traditions--some true, and"
3291,BLIND HARRY.,some false--which he found floating through the country. His authority
3292,BLIND HARRY.,"in reference to certain disputed matters, such as Wallace's journey to"
3293,BLIND HARRY.,"France, and his capture of the Red Rover, Thomas de Longueville, who"
3294,BLIND HARRY.,"became his fast friend and fellow-soldier, was not long ago entirely"
3295,BLIND HARRY.,established by certain important documents brought to light by the
3296,BLIND HARRY.,Maitland Club. It is probable that some other of his supposed
3297,BLIND HARRY.,misstatements--always excepting his ghost-stories--may yet receive from
3298,BLIND HARRY.,"future researches the confirmation they as yet want. Blind Harry, living"
3299,BLIND HARRY.,"about a century and a half after the era of Wallace, and at a time when"
3300,BLIND HARRY.,"tradition was the chief literature, was not likely to be able to test"
3301,BLIND HARRY.,the evidence of many of the circumstances which he narrated; but he
3302,BLIND HARRY.,"seems to speak in good faith: and, after all, what Paley says is"
3303,BLIND HARRY.,unquestionably true as a general principle--'Men tell lies about minute
3304,BLIND HARRY.,"circumstantials, but they rarely invent.'"

3586,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3587,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Here we have a great ascent from our former subject of biography--from
3588,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Blind Harry to James I.--from a beggar to a king. But in the Palace of
3589,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Poetry there are 'many mansions,' and men of all ranks, climes,"
3590,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"characters, professions, and we had almost added _talents_, have been"
3591,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"welcome to inhabit there. For, even as in the House Beautiful, the weak"
3592,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Ready-to-halt and the timid Much-afraid were as cheerfully received as
3593,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,the strong Honest and the bold Valiant-for-truth; so Poetry has inspired
3594,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"children, and seeming fools, and maniacs, and mendicants with the finest"
3595,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,breath of her spirit. The 'Fable-tree' Fontaine is as immortal as
3596,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Corneille; Christopher Smart's 'David' shall live as long as Milton's
3597,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"'Paradise Lost;' and the rude epic of a blind wanderer, whose birth,"
3598,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"parentage, and period of death are all alike unknown, shall continue to"
3599,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,rank in interest with the productions of one who inherited that kingdom
3600,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of Scotland, the independence of which was bought by the successive"
3601,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,efforts and the blended blood of Wallace and Bruce.
3602,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3603,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Let us now look for a moment at the history and the writings of this
3604,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,'Royal Poet.' The name will suggest to all intelligent readers the title
3605,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,of one of the most pleasing papers in Washington Irving's 'Sketch-book.'
3606,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"James I. was the son of Robert III. of Scotland,--a character familiar"
3607,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"to all from the admirable 'Fair Maid of Perth,'--and of Annabella"
3608,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Stewart. He was created Earl of Carrick; and after the miserable death
3609,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of the Duke of Rothesay, his elder brother, his father, apprehensive of"
3610,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the further designs of Albany, determined to send James to France, to"
3611,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,find an asylum and receive his education in that friendly Court. On his
3612,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"way, the vessel was captured off Flamborough Head by an English cruiser,"
3613,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"(the 13th of March 1405,) and the young prince, with his attendants, was"
3614,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"conveyed to London, and committed to the Tower. As there was a truce"
3615,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"between the two nations at the time, this was a flagrant outrage on the"
3616,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"law of nations, and has indelibly disgraced the memory of Henry IV.,"
3617,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"who, when some one remonstrated with him on the injustice of the"
3618,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"detention, replied, with cool brutality, 'Had the Scots been grateful,"
3619,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"they ought to have sent the youth to me, for I understand French well.'"
3620,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Here for nineteen years,--during the remainder of the life of Henry IV.,"
3621,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"and the whole of the reign of Henry V.,--James continued. He was"
3622,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"educated, however, highly, according to the fashion of these times,"
3623,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"--instructed in the languages, as well as in music, painting,"
3624,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"architecture, horticulture, dancing, fencing, poetry, and other"
3625,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,accomplishments. Still it must have fretted his high spirit to be
3626,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"passing his young life in prison, while without horses were stamping,"
3627,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"plumes glistening, trumpets sounding, tournaments waging, and echoes"
3628,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,from the great victories of Henry V. in France ringing around. One
3629,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"sweetener of his solitude, however, he at length enjoyed. Having been"
3630,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"transferred from the Tower to Windsor Castle, he beheld one day from its"
3631,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"windows that beautiful vision he has described in 'The King's Quhair,'"
3632,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"(see 'Specimens.') This was Lady Jane or Joanna Beaufort, daughter of"
3633,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the Earl of Somerset, niece of Richard II., and grand-daughter of John"
3634,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. She was a lady of great beauty and"
3635,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"accomplishments as well as of high rank, and James, even before he knew"
3636,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"her name, became deeply enamoured. The passion was returned, and their"
3637,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,mutual attachment had by and by an important bearing upon his prospects.
3638,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3639,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"In 1423, the Duke of Bedford being now the English Regent, the friends"
3640,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,of James renewed negotiations--often attempted before in vain--for his
3641,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"return to his native land, where his father had been long dead, and"
3642,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"which, torn by factions and steeped in blood, was sorely needing his"
3643,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,presence. Commissioners from the two kingdoms met at Pontefract on the
3644,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"12th of May 1423, when, in presence of the young King, and with his"
3645,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"consent, matters were arranged. The English coolly demanded £40,000 to"
3646,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"defray the expense of James's nurture and education, (as though a _bill_"
3647,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,were handed in to a man who had been unjustly detained in prison on
3648,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"a false charge, ere he left its walls,) insisted on the immediate"
3649,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"departure of the Scots from France, where a portion of them were"
3650,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fighting in the French army, and procured the assent of the Scottish"
3651,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Privy Council to the marriage of James with his beloved Jane Beaufort.
3652,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"A truce, too, with Scotland was concluded for seven years. All this was"
3653,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"settled; and soon after, in the Church of St Mary Overies, Southwark,"
3654,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"so often alluded to in the 'Life of Gower,' the happy pair were wed."
3655,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"It seemed a most auspicious event for both countries, and to augur"
3656,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,the substitution of permanent peace for casual and temporary truces.
3657,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"To Lady Jane Beaufort it gave a crown, and a noble, gallant, and gifted"
3658,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"prince to share it withal. On James it bestowed a lady of great beauty,"
3659,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"who was regarded, too, with gratitude as having lightened the load of"
3660,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"his captivity, and been a sunshine in his shady place, and--least"
3661,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"consideration--who brought him a dowry of £10,000, which was, in fact,"
3662,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,a remission of the fourth part of his ransom.
3663,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3664,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Attended by a magnificent retinue, the royal pair set out for Scotland."
3665,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,They were met at Durham by three hundred of the principal nobility and
3666,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"gentry, twenty-eight of whom were retained by the English as hostages"
3667,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"for the national faith. Arrived on his native soil, James, at Melrose"
3668,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Abbey, gave his solemn assent on the Holy Gospels to the treaty; and"
3669,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,seldom have the Eildon Hills returned a louder and more joyous shout
3670,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,of acclamation than now welcomed back to the kingdom of his fathers
3671,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the 'Royal Poet.' He proceeded to Edinburgh, where he celebrated Easter"
3672,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"with great pomp, and a month later, he and his queen were solemnly"
3673,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,crowned inthe Abbey Church at Scone. This was in 1424. He lived after
3674,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,this only thirteen years; but the period of his reign has always been
3675,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,thought a glorious interlude in the dark early history of Scotland.
3676,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"He set himself, with considerable success, to curb the exorbitant"
3677,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"power of the nobles, sacrificing some of them, such as Albany, to his"
3678,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,just indignation. He passed many useful regulations in reference to
3679,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the coinage, the constitution, and the commerce of the country. He"
3680,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,suppressed with a strong hand some of the gangs of robbers and 'sorners'
3681,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"which abounded, founding instead the order of Bedesmen or King's"
3682,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Beggars, immortalised since in the character of Edie Ochiltree. He"
3683,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,stretched a strong hand over the refractory Highland chieftains. While
3684,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"keeping at first on good terms with the English Court, he turned with a"
3685,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fonder eye to the French as the ancient allies of Scotland, and in 1436"
3686,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,gave his daughter Margaret in marriage to the Dauphin. This step roused
3687,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the jealousy of his southern neighbours, who tried even to intercept the"
3688,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fleet that was conveying the bride across the Channel, whereupon James,"
3689,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"stung to fury, proclaimed war against England, and in August commenced"
3690,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the siege of Roxburgh Castle. The castle, after being environed for"
3691,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fifteen days, was about to fall into his hands, when the Queen suddenly"
3692,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"arrived in the camp, and communicated some information, probably"
3693,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"referring to a threatened conspiracy of the nobles, which induced him"
3694,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"to throw up the siege, disband his army, and return northward in haste."
3695,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"This unexpected step probably retarded, but could not prevent the"
3696,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,dreadful purpose of death which had already been formed against the
3697,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,King.
3698,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3699,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"In October 1436, he held his last Parliament in Edinburgh, in which,"
3700,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"amidst many other enactments, we find, curiously enough, a prefiguration"
3701,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of the Forbes Mackenzie Act, in a decree that all taverns should be shut"
3702,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,at nine o'clock. In the end of the year he determined on retiring to
3703,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Perth, where (in the language of Gibbon, applied to Timour) 'he was"
3704,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"expected by the Angel of Death.' It is said that, when about to cross"
3705,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the Frith of Forth, then called the Scottish Sea, a Highland woman, who"
3706,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"claimed the character of a prophetess, like Meg Merrilees in fiction,"
3707,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"met the cavalcade, and cried out, with a loud voice, 'My Lord the King,"
3708,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,if you pass this water you shall never return again alive;' but as she
3709,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"was concluded to be mad or drunk, her warning was scorned. He betook"
3710,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"himself to the convent of the Black Friars, where Christmas was being"
3711,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"celebrated with great pomp and splendour. Meanwhile Robert Grahame, and"
3712,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Walter, Earl of Athole, the King's own uncle, actuated, the former by"
3713,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,revenge on account of the resumption of some lands improperly granted
3714,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"to his family, and the latter by a desire to succeed to the Crown, had"
3715,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"formed a plot against James's life. Several warnings, besides that of"
3716,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the Highland seeress, the King received, but he heeded them not, and,"
3717,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"like most of the doomed, was in unnaturally high spirits, as if the"
3718,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,winding-sheet far up his breast had been a wedding-robe.
3719,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3720,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,It is the evening of the 20th of February 1437. James and his nobles and
3721,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"ladies are seated at table till deep into the night, engaged in chess,"
3722,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"music, and song. Athole, like another Judas, has supped with them, and"
3723,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,gone out at a late hour. A tremendous knocking is heard at the gate. It
3724,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"is the Highland prophetess, who, having followed the monarch to Perth,"
3725,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"is seeking to force her way into the room. The King tells her, through"
3726,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"his usher, that he cannot receive her to-night, but will hear her"
3727,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"tidings to-morrow. She retires reluctantly, murmuring that they will for"
3728,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,ever rue their refusal to admit her into the royal presence. About an
3729,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"hour after this, James calls for the _Voidee_, or parting-cup, and the"
3730,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"company disperse. Sir Robert Stewart, the chamberlain, who is in the"
3731,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"confidence of the conspirators, is the last to retire, having previously"
3732,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,destroyed the locks and removed the bars of the doors of the royal bed-
3733,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,chamber and the outer room adjoining. The King is standing before the
3734,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"fire, in his night-gown and slippers, and talking gaily with the Queen"
3735,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"and her ladies, when torches are seen flashing up from the garden, and"
3736,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,the clash of arms and the sound of angry voices is heard from below. A
3737,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,sense of the dread reality bursts on them in an instant. The Queen and
3738,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the ladies run to secure the door of the chamber, while James, seizing"
3739,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"the tongs, wrenches up one of the boards of the floor and takes refuge"
3740,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"in a vault beneath. This was wont to have an opening to the outer court,"
3741,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"but it had unfortunately been built up of late by his own orders. There,"
3742,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"under the replaced boards, cowers the King, while the Queen and her"
3743,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"women seek to barricade the door. One brave young lady, Catherine"
3744,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"Douglas, thrusts her beautiful arm into the staple from which the bolt"
3745,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"had been removed. It is broken in a moment, and she sinks back, to bear,"
3746,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,with her descendants--a family well known in Scotland--the name of
3747,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"_Barlass_ ever since. The murderers, who had previously killed in the"
3748,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"passage one Walter Straiton, a page, rush in, with naked swords,"
3749,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"wounding the ladies, striking, and well-nigh killing the Queen, and"
3750,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"crying, with frantic imprecations, 'This is but a woman! Where is"
3751,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"James?' Finding him not in the chamber, they leave it, and disperse"
3752,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,through the neighbouring apartments in search.
3753,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,
3754,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"James, who had become wearied of his immurement, and thought the"
3755,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"assassins were gone, calls now on one of the ladies to aid him in coming"
3756,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"out of his place of concealment. But while this is being effected, one"
3757,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"of the murderers returns. The cry, 'Found, found,' rings through the"
3758,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"halls; and after a violent but unarmed resistance, the King is, with"
3759,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"circumstances of horrible barbarity, first mangled, then run through the"
3760,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"body, and then despatched with daggers. In vain he offers half his"
3761,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"kingdom for his life; and when he seeks a confessor from Grahame, the"
3762,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"ruffian replies, 'Thou shalt have no confessor but this sword.' It is"
3763,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"satisfactory to know that the Queen made her escape, and that the"
3764,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"criminals were punished, although the tortures they endured are such"
3765,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"as human nature shrinks from conceiving, and history with a shudder"
3766,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,records.

3771,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,although there is so little of it that a sentence or two will suffice.
3772,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"'The King's Quhair' is a poem conceived very much in the spirit, and"
3773,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"written in the style of Chaucer, whose works were favourites with James."
3774,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"There is the same sympathy with nature, and the same perception of _its_"
3775,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"relation to and unconscious sympathy with human feelings, and the same"
3776,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"luscious richness in the description, alike of the early beauties of"
3777,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,"spring and of youthful feminine loveliness, although this seems more"
3778,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,natural in the young poet James than in the sexagenarian author of 'The
3779,JAMES I. OF SCOTLAND.,Canterbury Tales.' There is nothing even in Chaucer we think finer than

4009,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,The first of these is the only versifier that can be assigned to England
4010,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"in the reign of Henry IV. His name was John Walton, though he was"
4011,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,generally known as _Johannes Capellanus_ or 'John the Chaplain.' He was
4012,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"canon of Oseney, and died sub-dean of York. He, in the year 1410,"
4013,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"translated Boethius' famous treatise, 'De Consolatione Philosophiae,'"
4014,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,into English verse. He is not known to have written anything original.
4015,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"--Thomas Occleve appeared in the reign of Henry V., about 1420. Like"
4016,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"Chaucer and Gower, he was a student of municipal law, having attended"
4017,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"Chester's Inn, which stood on the site of the present Somerset House;"
4018,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"but although he trod in the footsteps of his celebrated predecessors, it"
4019,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"was with far feebler powers. His original pieces are contemptible, both"
4020,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,in subject and in execution. His best production is a translation of
4021,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"'Egidius De Regimine Principum.' Warton, alluding to the period at which"
4022,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"these writers appeared, has the following oft-quoted observations:"
4023,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,--'I consider Chaucer as a genial day in an English spring. A brilliant
4024,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,sun enlivens the face of nature with an unusual lustre; the sudden
4025,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"appearance of cloudless skies, and the unexpected warmth of a tepid"
4026,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"atmosphere, after the gloom and the inclemencies of a tedious winter,"
4027,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"fill our hearts with the visionary prospect of a speedy summer, and we"
4028,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,fondly anticipate a long continuance of gentle gales and vernal serenity.
4029,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,But winter returns with redoubled horrors; the clouds condense more
4030,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"formidably than before, and those tender buds and early blossoms which"
4031,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"were called forth by the transient gleam of a temporary sunshine, are"
4032,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"nipped by frosts and torn by tempests.' These sentences are, after all,"
4033,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"rather pompous, and express, in the most verbose style of the _Rambler_,"
4034,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"the simple fact, that after Chaucer's death the ground lay fallow, and"
4035,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,that for a while in England (in Scotland it was otherwise) there were
4036,JOHN THE CHAPLAIN--THOMAS OCCLEVE.,"few poets, and little poetry."

4042,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4043,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4044,JOHN LYDGATE.,This copious and versatile writer flourished in the reign of Henry VI.
4045,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Warton affirms that he reached his highest point of eminence in 1430,"
4046,JOHN LYDGATE.,although some of his poems had appeared before. He was a monk of the
4047,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Benedictine Abbey at Bury, in Suffolk. He received his education at"
4048,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Oxford; and when it was finished, he travelled through France and Italy,"
4049,JOHN LYDGATE.,"mastering the languages and literature of both countries, and studying"
4050,JOHN LYDGATE.,"their poets, particularly Dante, Boccaccio, and Alain Chartier. When he"
4051,JOHN LYDGATE.,"returned, he opened a school in his monastery for teaching the sons of"
4052,JOHN LYDGATE.,the nobility composition and the art of versification. His acquirements
4053,JOHN LYDGATE.,"were, for the age, universal. He was a poet, a rhetorician, an astronomer,"
4054,JOHN LYDGATE.,"a mathematician, a public disputant, and a theologian. He was born in"
4055,JOHN LYDGATE.,"1370, ordained sub-deacon in 1389, deacon in 1393, and priest in 1397."
4056,JOHN LYDGATE.,"The time of his death is uncertain. His great patron was Humphrey, Duke"
4057,JOHN LYDGATE.,"of Gloucester, to whom he complains sometimes of necessitous circumstances,"
4058,JOHN LYDGATE.,"which were, perhaps, produced by indulgence, since he confesses himself to"
4059,JOHN LYDGATE.,be 'a lover of wine.'
4060,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4061,JOHN LYDGATE.,The great merit of Lydgate is his versatility. This Warton has happily
4062,JOHN LYDGATE.,"expressed in a few sentences, which we shall quote:--"
4063,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4064,JOHN LYDGATE.,'He moves with equal ease in every form of composition. His hymns and
4065,JOHN LYDGATE.,his ballads have the same degree of merit; and whether his subject be
4066,JOHN LYDGATE.,"the life of a hermit or a hero, of Saint Austin or Guy, Earl of Warwick,"
4067,JOHN LYDGATE.,"ludicrous or legendary, religious or romantic, a history or an allegory,"
4068,JOHN LYDGATE.,"he writes with facility. His transitions were rapid, from works of the"
4069,JOHN LYDGATE.,"most serious and laborious kind, to sallies of levity and pieces of"
4070,JOHN LYDGATE.,popular entertainment. His muse was of universal access; and he was not
4071,JOHN LYDGATE.,"only the poet of his monastery, but of the world in general. If a"
4072,JOHN LYDGATE.,"disguising was intended by the Company of Goldsmiths, a mask before His"
4073,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Majesty at Eltham, a May game for the sheriffs and aldermen of London,"
4074,JOHN LYDGATE.,"a mumming before the Lord Mayor, a procession of pageants, from the"
4075,JOHN LYDGATE.,"""Creation,"" for the Festival of Corpus Christi, or a carol for the"
4076,JOHN LYDGATE.,"coronation, Lydgate was consulted, and gave the poetry.'"
4077,JOHN LYDGATE.,
4078,JOHN LYDGATE.,"Lydgate is, so far as we know, the first British bard who wrote for"
4079,JOHN LYDGATE.,"hire. At the request of Whethamstede, the Abbot of St Alban's, he"
4080,JOHN LYDGATE.,"translated a 'Life of St Alban' from Latin into English rhymes, and"
4081,JOHN LYDGATE.,"received for the whole work one hundred shillings. His principal poems,"
4082,JOHN LYDGATE.,"all founded on the works of other authors, are the 'Fall of Princes,'"
4083,JOHN LYDGATE.,"the 'Siege of Thebes,' and the 'Destruction of Troy.' They are written"
4084,JOHN LYDGATE.,"in a diffuse and verbose style, but are generally clear in sense, and"
4085,JOHN LYDGATE.,often very luxuriant in description. 'The London Lyckpenny' is a
4086,JOHN LYDGATE.,"fugitive poem, in which the author describes himself coming up to town"
4087,JOHN LYDGATE.,"in search of legal redress for a wrong, and gives some curious"
4088,JOHN LYDGATE.,particulars of the condition of that city in the early part of the
4089,JOHN LYDGATE.,fifteenth century.

4239,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,
4240,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,
4241,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,John Harding flourished about the year 1403. He fought at the battle of
4242,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,Shrewsbury on the Percy side. He is the author of a poem entitled 'The
4243,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Chronicle of England unto the Reign of King Edward the Fourth, in"
4244,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Verse.' It has no poetic merit, and little interest, except to the"
4245,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,antiquary. In the reign of the above king we find the first mention of
4246,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"a Poet Laureate. John Kay was appointed by Edward, when he returned from"
4247,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Italy, Poet Laureate to the king, but has, perhaps fortunately for the"
4248,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"world, left behind him no poems. Would that the same had been the case"
4249,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"with some of his successors in the office! There is reason to believe,"
4250,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"that for nearly two centuries ere this date, there had existed in the"
4251,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"court a personage, entitled the King's Versifier, (versificator,) to"
4252,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"whom one hundred shillings a-year was the salary, and that the title"
4253,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"was, by and by, changed to that of Poet Laureate, _i.e._, Laurelled"
4254,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,Poet. It had long been customary in the universities to crown scholars
4255,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"when they graduated with laurel, and Warton thinks that from these the"
4256,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"first poet laureates were selected, less for their general genius than"
4257,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,for their skill in Latin verse. Certainly the earliest of the Laureate
4258,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"poems, such as those by Baston and Gulielmus, who acted as royal poets"
4259,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"to Richard I. and Edward II., and wrote, the one on Richard's Crusade,"
4260,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"and the other on Edward's Siege of Stirling Castle, are in Latin. So"
4261,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"too are the productions of Andrew Bernard, who was the Poet Laureate"
4262,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,successively to Henry VII. and Henry VIII. It was not till after the
4263,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,Reformation had lessened the superstitious veneration for the Latin
4264,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,tongue that the laureates began to write in English. It is almost a
4265,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"pity, we are sometimes disposed to think, that, in reference to such"
4266,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"odes as those of Pye, Whitehead, Colley Cibber, and even some of"
4267,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Southey's, the old practice had not continued; since thus, in the first"
4268,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"place, we might have had a chance of elegant Latinity, in the absence of"
4269,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"poetry and sense; and since, secondly, the deficiencies of the laureate"
4270,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"poems would have been disguised, from the general eye at least, under"
4271,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,the veil of an unknown tongue. It is curious to notice about this period
4272,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"the uprise of two didactic poets, both writing on alchymy, the chemistry"
4273,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"of that day, and neither displaying a spark of genius. These are John"
4274,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Norton and George Ripley, both renowned for learning and knowledge of"
4275,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"their beloved occult sciences. Their poems, that by Norton, entitled"
4276,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"'The Ordinal,' and that by Ripley, entitled 'The Compound of Alchemie,'"
4277,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"are dry and rugged treatises, done into indifferent verse. One rather"
4278,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,fine fancy occurs in the first of these. It is that of an alchymist who
4279,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"projected a bridge of gold over the Thames, near London, crowned with"
4280,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"pinnacles of gold, which, being studded with carbuncles, should diffuse"
4281,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,a blaze of light in the dark! Alchymy has had other and nobler singers
4282,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"than Ripley and Norton. It has, as Warton remarks, 'enriched the store-"
4283,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,house of Arabian romance with many magnificent imageries.' It is the
4284,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,inspiration of two of the noblest romances in this or any language
4285,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"--'St. Leon' and 'Zanoni.' And its idea, transfigured into a transcen-"
4286,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"dental form, gave light and life and fire, and the loftiest poetry, to"
4287,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"the eloquence of the lamented Samuel Brown, whose tongue, as he talked"
4288,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"on his favourite theme, seemed transmuted into gold; nay, whose lips,"
4289,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"like the touch of Midas, seemed to create the effects of alchymy upon"
4290,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"every subject they approached, and upon every heart over which they"
4291,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,wielded their sorcery.
4292,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,
4293,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,We pass now from this comparatively barren age in the history of English
4294,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,poetry to a cluster of Scottish bards. The first of these is ROBERT
4295,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"HENRYSON. He was schoolmaster at Dunfermline, and died some time before"
4296,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,1508. He is supposed by Lord Hailes to have been preceptor of youth in
4297,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,the Benedictine convent in that place. He is the author of 'Robene and
4298,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Makyne,' a pastoral ballad of very considerable merit, and of which"
4299,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Campbell says, somewhat too warmly, 'It is the first known pastoral,'"
4300,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"(he means in the Scottish language of course,) 'and one of the best, in"
4301,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,a dialect rich with the favours of the pastoral muse.' He wrote also a
4302,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,sequel to Chaucer's 'Troilus and Cresseide' entitled 'The Testament of
4303,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Cresseide,' and thirteen Fables, of which copies, in MS., are preserved"
4304,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh. One of these, 'The Town and"
4305,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"Country Mouse,' tells that old story with considerable spirit and"
4306,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,humour. 'The Garment of Good Ladies' is an ingenious and beautiful
4307,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"strain, written in that quaint style of allegorising which continued"
4308,THE LONDON LYCKPENNY.,"popular as far down as the days of Cowley, and even later."

4546,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4547,WILLIAM DUNBAR,This was a man of the true and sovereign seed of genius. Sir Walter
4548,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Scott calls Dunbar 'a poet unrivalled by any--that Scotland has ever
4549,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"produced.' We venture to call him the Dante of Scotland; nay, we"
4550,WILLIAM DUNBAR,question if any English poet has surpassed 'The Dance of the Seven
4551,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Deadly Sins through Hell' in its peculiarly Dantesque qualities of
4552,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"severe and purged grandeur; of deep sincerity, and in that air of moral"
4553,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"disappointment and sorrow, approaching despair, which distinguished the"
4554,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"sad-hearted lover of Beatrice, who might almost have exclaimed, with one"
4555,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"yet mightier than he in his misery and more miserable in his might,"
4556,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4557,WILLIAM DUNBAR,'Where'er I am is Hell--myself am Hell.'
4558,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4559,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Foster, in an entry in his journal, (we quote from memory,) says, 'I"
4560,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"have just seen the moon rising, and wish the impression to be eternal."
4561,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"What a look she casts upon earth, like that of a celestial being who"
4562,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"loves our planet still, but has given up all hope of ever doing her any"
4563,WILLIAM DUNBAR,good or seeing her become any better--so serene she seems in her settled
4564,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"and unutterable sadness.' Such, we have often fancied, was the feeling"
4565,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"of the great Florentine toward the world, and which--pained, pitying,"
4566,WILLIAM DUNBAR,yearning enthusiast that he was!--escaped irresistibly from those deep-
4567,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"set eyes, that adamantine jaw, and that brow, wearing the laurel, proudly"
4568,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"yet painfully, as if it were a crown of everlasting fire! Dunbar was not"
4569,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"altogether a Dante, either in melancholy or in power, but his 'Dance'"
4570,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"reveals kindred moods, operating at times on a kindred genius."
4571,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4572,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"In Dante humour existed too, but ere it could come up from his deep"
4573,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"nature to the surface, it must freeze and stiffen into monumental scorn"
4574,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"--a laughter that seemed, while mocking at all things else, to mock at"
4575,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"its own mockery most of all. Aird speaks in his 'Demoniac,' of a smile"
4576,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"upon his hero's brow,"
4577,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4578,WILLIAM DUNBAR,'Like the lightning of a hope about to DIE
4579,WILLIAM DUNBAR,For ever from the furrow'd brows of Hell's Eternity.'
4580,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4581,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Dante's smile may rather be compared to the RISING of a false and self-
4582,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"detected hope upon the lost brows where it is never to come to dawn, and"
4583,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"where, nevertheless, it remains for ever, like a smile carved upon"
4584,WILLIAM DUNBAR,a sepulchre. Dunbar has a more joyous disposition than his Italian
4585,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"prototype and master, and he indulges himself to the top of his bent,"
4586,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"but in a style (particularly in his 'Twa Married Women and the Widow,'"
4587,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"and in 'The Friars of Berwick,' which is not, however, quite certainly"
4588,WILLIAM DUNBAR,his) too coarse and prurient for the taste of this age.
4589,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4590,WILLIAM DUNBAR,'The Merle and the Nightingale' is one of the finest of Moelibean poems.
4591,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Beautiful is the contest between the two sweet singers as to whether the
4592,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"love of man or the love of God be the nobler, and more beautiful still"
4593,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"their reconciliation, when"
4594,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4595,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"'Then sang they both with voices loud and clear,"
4596,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"The Merle sang, ""Man, love God that has thee wrought."""
4597,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"The Nightingale sang, ""Man, love the Lord most dear,"
4598,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"That thee and all this world made of nought."""
4599,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"The Merle said, ""Love him that thy love has sought"
4600,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"From heaven to earth, and here took flesh and bone."""
4601,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"The Nightingale sang. ""And with his death thee bought:"
4602,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"All love is lost, but upon him alone."""
4603,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4604,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"_'Then flew these birds over the boughis sheen,"
4605,WILLIAM DUNBAR,Singing of love among the leaves small.'_
4606,WILLIAM DUNBAR,
4607,WILLIAM DUNBAR,William Dunbar is said to have been born about the year 1465. He
4608,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"received his education at St Andrews, and took there the degree of M.A."
4609,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"in 1479. He became then a friar of the Franciscan order, (Grey Friars,)"
4610,WILLIAM DUNBAR,and in the exercise of his profession seems to have rambled over all
4611,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Scotland, England, and France, preaching, begging, and, according to his"
4612,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"own confession, cheating, lying, and cajoling. Yet if this kind of life"
4613,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"was not propitious, in his case, to morality, it must have been to the"
4614,WILLIAM DUNBAR,development of the poetic faculty. It enabled him to see all varieties
4615,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"of life and of scenery, although here and there, in his verses, you find"
4616,WILLIAM DUNBAR,symptoms of that bitterness which is apt to arise in the heart of a
4617,WILLIAM DUNBAR,wanderer. He was subsequently employed by James IV. in some official
4618,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"work connected with various foreign embassies, which led him to Spain,"
4619,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Italy, and Germany, as well as England and France. This proves that he"
4620,WILLIAM DUNBAR,was no less a man of business-capacity and habits than a poet. For these
4621,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"services he, in 1500, received from the King a pension of ten pounds,"
4622,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"afterwards increased to twenty, and, in fine, to eighty. He is said to"
4623,WILLIAM DUNBAR,have been employed in the negotiations preparatory to the marriage of
4624,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"James with Margaret Tudor, daughter of Henry VII., which took place in"
4625,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"1503, and which our poet celebrated in his verses, 'The Thistle and the"
4626,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Rose.' He continued ever afterwards in the Court, hovering in position"
4627,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"between a laureate and a court-fool, charming James with his witty"
4628,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"conversation as well as his verses, but refused the benefices for which"
4629,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"he petitioned, and gradually devoured by chagrin and disappointment."
4630,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"Seldom has genius so great been placed in a falser position, and this"
4631,WILLIAM DUNBAR,has given a querulous tinge to many of his poems. He seems to have died
4632,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"about 1520. Even after his death, misfortune pursued him. His works"
4633,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"were, with the exception of two or three pieces, locked up in an obscure"
4634,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"MS. till the middle of last century. Since then, however, their fame has"
4635,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"been still increasing. In 1834, Mr David Laing, so favourably known as"
4636,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"one of our first antiquarians, published a complete and elaborate edition"
4637,WILLIAM DUNBAR,of Dunbar's works; and in a newspaper this very day (May 23) we see another
4638,WILLIAM DUNBAR,"edition announced, in a popular and modernised shape, of the poetry of this"
4639,WILLIAM DUNBAR,great old Scottish _Makkar_.

5036,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,
5037,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"This eminent prelate was a younger son of Archibald, the fifth Earl of"
5038,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,Angus. He was born in Brechin about the year 1474. He studied at the
5039,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"University of Paris. He became a churchman, and yet united with"
5040,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,attention to the duties of his calling great proficiency in polite
5041,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"learning. In 1513 he finished a translation, into Scottish verse, of"
5042,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Virgil's 'Aeneid,' which, considering the age, is an extraordinary"
5043,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,performance. It occupied him only sixteen months. The multitude of
5044,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"obsolete terms, however, in which it abounds, renders it now, as a"
5045,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"whole, illegible. After passing through various subordinate offices,"
5046,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"such as the 'Provostship' of St Giles's, Edinburgh, and the 'Abbotship'"
5047,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"of Arbroath, he was at length appointed Bishop of Dunkeld. Dunkeld was"
5048,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"not then the paradise it has become, but Birnam hill and the other"
5049,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"mountains then, as now, stood round about it, the old Cathedral rose up"
5050,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"in mediaeval majesty, and the broad, smooth Tay flowed onward to the"
5051,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"ocean. And, doubtless, Douglas felt the poetic inspiration from it quite"
5052,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"as warmly as did Thomas Brown, when, three centuries afterwards, he set"
5053,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"up the staff of his summer rest at the beautiful Invar inn, and thence"
5054,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,delighted to diverge to the hundred scenes of enchantment which stretch
5055,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"around. The good Bishop was an ardent politician as well as a poet, and"
5056,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"was driven, by his share in the troubles of the times, to flee from his"
5057,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"native land, and take refuge in the Court of Henry VIII. The King"
5058,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"received him kindly, and treated him with much liberality. In 1522 he"
5059,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"died at London of the plague, and was interred in the Savoy Church."
5060,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"He was, according to Buchanan, about to proceed to Rome to vindicate"
5061,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,himself before the Pope against certain charges brought by his enemies.
5062,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Besides the translation of the 'Aeneid,' Douglas is the author of a long"
5063,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"poem entitled the 'Palace of Honour;' it is an allegory, describing"
5064,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,a large company making a pilgrimage to Honour's Palace. It bears
5065,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"considerable resemblance to the 'Pilgrim's Progress,' and some suppose"
5066,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,that Bunyan had seen it before composing his allegory. 'King Hart' is
5067,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"another production of our poet's, of considerable length and merit. It"
5068,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"gives, metaphorically, a view of human life. Perhaps his best pieces are"
5069,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"his 'Prologues,' affixed to each book of the 'Aeneid.' From them we have"
5070,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,selected 'Morning in May' as a specimen. The closing lines are fine.
5071,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,
5072,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"'Welcome the lord of light, and lamp of day,"
5073,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Welcome fosterer of tender herbis green,"
5074,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Welcome quickener of flourish'd flowers sheen,"
5075,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Welcome support of every root and vein,"
5076,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Welcome comfort of all kind fruit and grain,' &c."
5077,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,
5078,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,Douglas must not be named with Dunbar in strength and grandeur of
5079,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"genius. His power is more in expression than in conception, and hence"
5080,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,he has shone so much in translation. His version of the 'Aeneid' is the
5081,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"first made of any classic into a British tongue, and is the worthy"
5082,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,progenitor of such minor miracles of poetical talent--all somewhat more
5083,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"mechanical than inspired, and yet giving a real, though subordinate"
5084,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"glory to our literature-as Fairfax's 'Tasso,' Dryden's 'Virgil,' and"
5085,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Pope's, Coper's, and Sotheby's 'Homer.' The fire in Douglas' original"
5086,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"verses is occasionally lost in smoke, and the meaning buried in flowery"
5087,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,verbiage. Still he was an honour alike to the Episcopal bench and the
5088,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,"Muse of Scotland. He was of amiable manners, gentle temperament, and a"
5089,GAVIN DOUGLAS.,noble and commanding appearance.

5274,MORNING IN MAY.,"Stephen Hawes, a native of Suffolk, wrote about the close of the"
5275,MORNING IN MAY.,"fifteenth century. He studied at Oxford, and travelled much in France,"
5276,MORNING IN MAY.,"where he became a master of French and Italian poetry. King Henry VII.,"
5277,MORNING IN MAY.,struck with his conversation and the readiness with which he repeated
5278,MORNING IN MAY.,"old English poets, especially Lydgate, created him groom of the privy"
5279,MORNING IN MAY.,"chamber. Hawes has written a number of poems, such as 'The Temple of"
5280,MORNING IN MAY.,"Glasse,' 'The Conversion of Swearers,' 'The Consolation of Lovers,' 'The"
5281,MORNING IN MAY.,"Pastime of Pleasure,' &c. Those who wish to see specimens of the strange"
5282,MORNING IN MAY.,"allegories and curious devices of thought in which it abounds, may find"
5283,MORNING IN MAY.,them in Warton's 'History of English Poetry.'
5284,MORNING IN MAY.,
5285,MORNING IN MAY.,"In that same valuable work we find an account of Alexander Barclay, author"
5286,MORNING IN MAY.,"of 'The Ship of Fools.' He was educated at Oriel College in Oxford, and"
5287,MORNING IN MAY.,"after travelling abroad, was appointed one of the priests or prebendaries"
5288,MORNING IN MAY.,"of the College of St Mary Ottery, in Devonshire--a parish famous in later"
5289,MORNING IN MAY.,days for the birth of Coleridge. Barclay became afterwards a Benedictine
5290,MORNING IN MAY.,"monk of Ely monastery; and at length a brother of the Order of St Francis,"
5291,MORNING IN MAY.,"at Canterbury. He died, a very old man, at Croydon, in Surrey, in the year"
5292,MORNING IN MAY.,"1552. His principal work, 'The Ship of Fools,' is a satire upon the vices"
5293,MORNING IN MAY.,"and absurdities of his age, and shews considerable wit and power of"
5294,MORNING IN MAY.,sarcasm.

5302,SKELTON.,John Skelton is the name of the next poet. He flourished in the earlier
5303,SKELTON.,part of the reign of Henry VIII. Having studied both at Oxford and
5304,SKELTON.,"Cambridge, and been laureated at the former university in 1489, he was"
5305,SKELTON.,"promoted to the rectory of Diss or Dysse, in Norfolk. Some say he had"
5306,SKELTON.,acted previously as tutor to Henry VIII. At Dysse he attracted attention
5307,SKELTON.,"by satirical ballads against the mendicants, as well as by licences of"
5308,SKELTON.,"buffoonery in the pulpit. For these he was censured, and even, it is"
5309,SKELTON.,"said, suspended, by Nykke, Bishop of Norwich. Undaunted by this, he flew"
5310,SKELTON.,"at higher game--ventured to ridicule Cardinal Wolsey, then in his power,"
5311,SKELTON.,and had to take refuge from the myrmidons of the prelate in Westminster
5312,SKELTON.,Abbey. There Abbot Islip kindly entertained and protected him till his
5313,SKELTON.,"dying day. He breathed his last in the year 1529, and was buried in the"
5314,SKELTON.,adjacent church of St Margaret's.
5315,SKELTON.,
5316,SKELTON.,Skelton as well as Barclay enjoyed considerable popularity in his own
5317,SKELTON.,age. Erasmus calls him 'Britannicarum literarum lumen et decus!' How
5318,SKELTON.,dark must have been the night in which such a Will-o'-wisp was mistaken
5319,SKELTON.,"for a star! He has wit, indeed, and satirical observation; but his wit"
5320,SKELTON.,"is wilder than it is strong, and his satire is dashed with personality"
5321,SKELTON.,"and obscenity. His style, Campbell observes, is 'almost a texture of"
5322,SKELTON.,"slang phrases, patched with shreds of French and Latin.' His verses on"
5323,SKELTON.,"Margaret Hussey, which we have quoted, are in his happiest vein. The"
5324,SKELTON.,"following lines, too, on Cardinal Wolsey, are as true as they are"
5325,SKELTON.,terse:--
5326,SKELTON.,
5327,SKELTON.,'Then in the Chamber of Stars
5328,SKELTON.,All matter there he mars.
5329,SKELTON.,"Clapping his rod on the board,"

5388,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Returning to Scotland, we find a Skelton of a higher order and a"
5389,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"brawnier make in Sir David Lyndsay, or, as our forefathers were wont"
5390,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"familiarly to denominate him, 'Davie Lyndsay.' Lyndsay was descended"
5391,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"from a noble family, a younger branch of Lyndsay of the Byres, and born"
5392,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"in 1490, probably at the Mount, the family-seat, near Cupar-Fife. He"
5393,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"entered the University of St Andrews in the year 1505, and four years"
5394,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"later left it to travel in Italy. He must, however, have returned to"
5395,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Scotland before the 12th of October 1511, since we learn from the"
5396,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,records of the Lord Treasurer that he was presented with a quantity of
5397,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,'blue and yellow taffety to be a playcoat for the play performed in the
5398,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,King and Queen's presence in the Abbey of Holyrood.' On the 12th of
5399,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"April 1512, Lyndsay, then twenty-two years of age, was appointed"
5400,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"gentleman-usher to James V., who had been born that very day. In his"
5401,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"poem called 'The Dream,' he reminds the King of his having borne him"
5402,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,in his arms ere he could walk; of having wrapped him up warmly in his
5403,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"little bed; of having sung to him with his lute, danced before him to"
5404,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"make him laugh, and having carried him on his shoulders like a 'pedlar"
5405,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"his pack.' He continued to be page and companion to the King till 1524,"
5406,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"when, in consequence of the unprincipled machinations of the Queen-"
5407,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"mother--who was acting as Regent--he, as well as Bellenden, the learned"
5408,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"translator of Livy and Boece, was ejected from his office. When, however,"
5409,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"in 1528, the young King, by a noble effort, emancipated himself from the"
5410,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"thraldom of his mother and the Douglasses, Lyndsay wrote his 'Dream,' in"
5411,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"which, amidst much poetic or fantastic matter, he congratulates James on"
5412,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"his deliverance; reminds him, as aforesaid, of his early services; and"
5413,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,takes occasion to paint the evils the country had endured during his
5414,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"minority, and to give him some bold and salutary advice as to his future"
5415,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"conduct. The next year (1529) he produced 'The Complaint,' a poem in"
5416,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"which he recurs to former themes, and remonstrates with great freedom"
5417,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and severity against the treatment he had undergone. Here, too, the"
5418,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,religious reformer peeps out. He exhorts the King to compel the clergy
5419,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,to attend to the duties of their office; to preach more earnestly; to
5420,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,administer the sacraments according to the institution of Christ; and not
5421,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"to deceive their people with superstitious pilgrimages, vain traditions,"
5422,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and prayers to graven images, contrary to the written command of God. He"
5423,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"with quaint iron says, that if his Grace will lend him"
5424,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5425,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"'Of gold ane thousand pound or tway,'"
5426,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5427,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"he will give him a sealed bond, obliging himself to repay the loan when"
5428,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,the Bass and the Isle of May are set upon Mount Sinai; or the Lomond
5429,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"hills, near Falkland, are removed to Northumberland; or"
5430,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5431,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"'When kirkmen yairnis [desire] na dignity,"
5432,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Nor wives na soveranitie.'
5433,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5434,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Still finer the last lines of the poem. 'If not,' he says, 'my God"
5435,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5436,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,'Shall cause me stand content
5437,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"With quiet life and sober rent,"
5438,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"And take me, in my latter age,"
5439,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Unto my simple hermitage,"
5440,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"To spend the gear my elders won,"
5441,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,As did Diogenes in his tun.'
5442,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5443,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"This 'Complaint' proved successful, and in the next year (1530) Lyndsay"
5444,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,was appointed Lion King-at-Arms--an office of great dignity in these
5445,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,days. The Lion was the chief judge of all matters connected with
5446,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,heraldry in the realm; was also the official ambassador from his
5447,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,sovereign to foreign countries; and was inaugurated in his office with
5448,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"a pomp and circumstance little inferior to those of a royal coronation,"
5449,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the King crowning him with his own hands, anointing him with wine"
5450,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"instead of oil, and putting on his head the Royal Crown of Scotland,"
5451,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,which he continued to wear till the close of the feast. It is of Lyndsay
5452,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,in the full accoutrements of this office that Sir Walter Scott speaks in
5453,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"his 'Marmion,' although he antedates by sixteen years the time when he"

5486,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Lord Lion King-at-Arms.'
5487,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5488,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Soon after this appointment, Lyndsay wrote 'The Complaint of the King's"
5489,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Papingo,' in which, through the mouth of a dying parrot, he gives some"
5490,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"sharp counsel to the king, his courtiers and nobles, and administers"
5491,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,severe satirical chastisement to the corruptions of the clergy. It is an
5492,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"exceedingly clever production, and has some beautiful poetry as well as"
5493,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"stinging sarcasm. Take the following address to Edinburgh, Stirling,"
5494,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Linlithgow, and Falkland:--"
5495,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5496,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Adieu, Edinburgh! thou high triumphant town,"
5497,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Within whose bounds right blitheful have I been;

5499,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Most ready to receive court, king, and queen;"

5504,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Adieu, fair Snawdoun! [Stirling] with thy towers hie,"
5505,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Thy chapel-royal, park, and table round;"
5506,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"May, June, and July would I dwell in thee,"
5507,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Were I a man to hear the birdis sound,"
5508,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Which doth against the royal rock rebound.
5509,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Adieu, Lithgow! whose palace of pleasance"
5510,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Meets not its peer in Portingale or France.
5511,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5512,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Farewell, Falkland! the forteress of Fife,"
5513,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Thy velvet park under the Lomond Law;
5514,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Sometime in thee I led a lusty life.

5516,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Caust men to come to thee, they have great awe, &c."
5517,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5518,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"In the year 1535, Lyndsay wrote his remarkable drama, 'The Satire of the"
5519,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Three Estates'--Monarch, namely, Barons, and Clergy. It is made up in"
5520,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"nearly three equal parts of ingenuity, wit, and grossness. It is a drama,"
5521,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and was acted several times--first, in 1535, at Cupar-Fife, on a large"
5522,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"green mound called Moot-hill; then, in 1539, in an open park near"
5523,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Linlithgow, by the express desire of the king, who with all the ladies"
5524,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,of the Court attended the representation; then in the amphitheatre of
5525,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"St Johnston in Perth; and in 1554, at Edinburgh, in the village of"
5526,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Greenside, which skirted the northern base of the Calton Hill, in the"
5527,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,presence of the Queen Regent and an enormous concourse of spectators.
5528,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,Its exhibition appears to have occupied nearly the whole day. In the
5529,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"'Pictorial History of Scotland,' chapter xxiv., our readers will find a"
5530,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,full and able analysis with extracts of this extraordinary performance.
5531,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,It is said to have done much good in opening the eyes of the people to
5532,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the evils of the Papacy, and in paving the way for the Reformation."
5533,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5534,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"In 1536 Sir David, in company with Sir John Campbell of Lundie, was sent"
5535,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,to the Court of France to demand in marriage for James V. a daughter of
5536,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,the House of Vendome; but the King chose rather to take the matter in
5537,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"his own hands, and, going over in person, wedded Magdalene, daughter of"
5538,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Francis. She died two months after her arrival in Scotland, universally"
5539,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"regretted; and Lyndsay made the sad event the subject of a poem,"
5540,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"entitled 'Deploration of the Death of Queen Magdalene,' whom he"
5541,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,designates
5542,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5543,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"'The flower of France, and comfort of Scotland.'"
5544,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5545,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"When James subsequently married Mary of Guise, Sir David's ingenuity was"
5546,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"strained to the utmost in providing pageants, masques, and shows to"
5547,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"welcome her Majesty. For forty days in St Andrews, festivities continued;"
5548,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and it was during this prolonged festival that the Lion King, as if sick"
5549,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and satiated with vanities, wrote two poems, one entitled 'The Justing"
5550,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"between James Watson and John Barbour,' a dull satire on tournaments, &c.,"
5551,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"and the other a somewhat cleverer piece, entitled 'Supplication directed"
5552,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"to the King's Grace in Contemptioun of Side Tails,' the long trains then"
5553,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"worn by the ladies. It met, we presume,with the fate of _Punch's_ sarcasms"
5554,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"against crinoline,--the 'phylacteries' would for a season, instead of"
5555,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"being lessened, be enlarged, till Fashion lifted up her omnipotent rod,"
5556,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,and told it to be otherwise.
5557,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5558,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"King James died prematurely on the 14th of December 1542, and Lyndsay"
5559,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"closed his eyes at Falkland, and mourned for him as a brother. From that"
5560,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,day forth he probably felt that there was 'less sunshine in the sky for
5561,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"him.' In the troublous times which succeeded this, he had to retire for"
5562,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"a season from the Court, having become obnoxious to the rigid Papists on"
5563,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,account of his writings. After the death of Cardinal Beatoun he wrote
5564,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the tragedy of 'The Cardinal,' a poem in which the spectre of the"
5565,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Cardinal is the spokesman, and which teems with good advice to all and"
5566,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"sundry. The execution, however, is not so felicitous as the plan. In"
5567,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,1548 Lyndsay went to Denmark to negotiate a free trade with Scotland. On
5568,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,his return in 1550 he wrote his very pleasing and chivalric 'History of
5569,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Squire Meldrum,' founded on the actual adventures of William Meldrum,"
5570,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the Laird of Cleish and Binns, a distinguished friend of the poet, who"
5571,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,had gained laurels as a warrior both in Scotland and in France. This
5572,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"poem is, in a measure, an anticipation of the rhymed romances of Scott,"
5573,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,and is full of picturesque description and spirit-stirring adventure. In
5574,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"1553 he completed his last and most elaborate work, which had occupied"
5575,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"him for years, entitled 'The Monarchic,' containing an account of the"
5576,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"most famous monarchies which have existed on earth, and carrying on the"
5577,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,history to the general judgment. From this date we almost entirely lose
5578,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"sight of our poet. He seems to have retired into private life, and is"
5579,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,supposed to have died about the close of 1557. He was probably buried in
5580,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"the family vault at Ceres, but no stone marks the spot. Dying without"
5581,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"issue, his estates passed to his brother Alexander, and were continued"
5582,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,in the possession of his descendants till the middle of last century.
5583,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,They now belong to the Hopes of Rankeillour. The office of Lord Lion was
5584,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"held by two of the poet's relatives successively--Sir David, his"
5585,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"nephew, who became Lion King in 1591, and his son-in-law, Sir Jerome"
5586,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Lyndsay, who succeeded to it in 1621."
5587,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,
5588,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Sir David Lyndsay, unlike most satirists, was a good, a blameless, and a"
5589,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"religious man. The occasional loftiness of his poetic vein, the breadth"
5590,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"of his humour, the purity of his purpose, and his strong reforming zeal"
5591,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,combined to make his poetry exceedingly popular in Scotland for a number
5592,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"of ages, particularly among the lower orders. Scott introduces Andrew"
5593,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"Fairservice, in 'Rob Roy,' saying, in reference to Francis Osbaldistone's"
5594,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"poetical efforts, 'Gude help him! twa lines o' Davie Lyndsay wad ding a'"
5595,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,"he ever clerkit,' and even still there are districts of the country where"
5596,SIR DAVID LYNDSAY.,his name is a household word.

5886,MORAL REFLECTIONS ON THE WIND.,"Borde, Bale, Bryan, Annesley, John Rastell, Wilfred Holme, and Charles"
5887,MORAL REFLECTIONS ON THE WIND.,"Bansley, all writers of minor and forgotten poems. John Heywood, called"

6166,"THOMAS SACKVILLE, LORD BUCKHURST AND EARL OF DORSET.",thirty years of age. In the same year (1557) he formed the plan of a

6547,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6548,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6549,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,All hail to Sidney!--the pink of chivalry--the hero of Zutphen--the author
6550,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"of the 'Arcadia,'--the gifted, courteous, genial and noble-minded man! He"
6551,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"was born November 29, 1554, at Penshurst, Kent. His father's name was"
6552,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Henry. He studied at Shrewsbury, at Trinity College, Cambridge, and at"
6553,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Christ Church, Oxford. At the age of eighteen he set out on his travels,"
6554,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"and, in the course of three years, visited France, Flanders, Germany,"
6555,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Hungary, and Italy. On his return he was introduced at Court, and became a"
6556,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"favourite with Queen Elizabeth, who sent him on an embassy to Germany. He"
6557,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"returned home, and shortly after had a quarrel at a tournament with Lord"
6558,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Oxford. But for the interference of the Queen, a duel would have taken"
6559,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"place. Sidney was displeased at the issue of the affair, and retired, in"
6560,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"1580, to Wilton, in Wiltshire, where he wrote his famous 'Arcadia,'--that"
6561,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"true prose-poem, and a work which, with all its faults, no mere sulky and"
6562,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,spoiled child (as some have called him in the matter of this retreat)
6563,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"could ever have produced. This production, written as an outflow of his"
6564,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"mind in its self-sought solitude, was never meant for publication, and did"
6565,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,not appear till after its author's death. As it was written partly for his
6566,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"sister's amusement, he entitled it 'The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia.'"
6567,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"In 1581, Sidney reappeared in Court, and distinguished himself in the"
6568,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,jousts and tournaments celebrated in honour of the Duke of Anjou; and on
6569,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"the return of that prince to the Continent, he accompanied him to Antwerp."
6570,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,In 1583 he received the honour of knighthood. He published about this time
6571,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"a tract entitled 'The Defence of Poesy,' which abounds in the element the"
6572,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"praise of which it celebrates, and which is, besides, distinguished by"
6573,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,acuteness of argument and felicity of expression. In 1585 he was named one
6574,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"of the candidates for the crown of Poland; but Queen Elizabeth, afraid of"
6575,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"'losing the jewel of her times,' prevented him from accepting this honour,"
6576,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,and prevented him also from accompanying Sir Francis Drake on an
6577,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"expedition against the Spanish settlements in America. In the same year,"
6578,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"however, she made him Governor of Flushing, and subsequently General of"
6579,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"the Cavalry, under his uncle, the Earl of Leicester, who commanded the"
6580,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,troops sent to assist the oppressed Dutch Protestants against the
6581,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Spaniards. Here our hero greatly distinguished himself, particularly when"
6582,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"capturing, in 1586, the town of Axel. His career, however, was destined"
6583,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,to be short. On the 22d of September of the same year he accidentally
6584,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,encountered a convoy of the enemy marching toward Zutphen. In the
6585,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"engagement which followed, his party triumphed; but their brave commander"
6586,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"received a shot in the thigh, which shattered the bone. As he was carried"
6587,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"from the field, overcome with thirst, he called for water, but while about"
6588,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"to apply it to his lips, he saw a wounded soldier carried by who was"
6589,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"eagerly eyeing the cup. Sidney, perceiving this, instantly delivered to"
6590,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"him the water, saying, in words which would have made an ordinary man"
6591,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"immortal, but which give Sir Philip a twofold immortality, 'Thy necessity"
6592,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"is greater than mine.' He was carried to Arnheim, and lingered on till"
6593,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"October 17, when he died. He was only thirty-two years of age. His death"
6594,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,was an earthquake at home. All England wore mourning for him. Queen
6595,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Elizabeth ordered his remains to be carried to London, and to receive a"
6596,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"public funeral in St Paul's. He was identified with the land's Poetry,"
6597,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Politeness, and Protestantism; and all who admired any of the three,"
6598,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,sorrowed for Sidney.
6599,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6600,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"Sidney's 'Sonnets and other Poems' contain much that is quaint, but also"
6601,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,much that is beautiful and true; yet they are the least poetical of his
6602,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,works. His 'Arcadia' is a glorious unfinished and unpolished wilderness
6603,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"of fancy. It is a vineyard, the scattered clusters of which are so heavy,"
6604,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"that, like the grapes of Eshcol of old, they must be carried on a staff."
6605,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,Here is one of those rich clusters:--
6606,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6607,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"'There were hills, which garnished their proud heights with stately"
6608,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"trees; humble valleys, whose base estate seemed comforted with the"
6609,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"refreshing of silver rivers; meadows, enamelled with all sorts of"
6610,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"eye-pleasing flowers; thickets, which, being lined with most pleasant"
6611,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"shade, were witnessed so, too, by the cheerful disposition of many"
6612,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"well-tuned birds; each pasture stored with sheep, feeding with sober"
6613,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"security; while the pretty lambs, with bleating oratory, craved the"
6614,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"dams' comfort; _here a shepherd's boy, piping as though he should"
6615,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"never be old;_ there a young shepherdess, knitting and withal singing,"
6616,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"and it seemed that her voice comforted her hands to work, and her"
6617,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,hands kept time to her voice-music.'
6618,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,
6619,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"From 'The Defence of Poesy' we could cull, did space permit, a hundred"
6620,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"passages even superior to the above, full of dexterous reasoning, splendid"
6621,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"rhetoric, and subtle fancy, and substantiating all that has been said in"
6622,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,"favour of Sir Philip Sidney's accomplishments, chivalric earnestness, and"
6623,SIR PHILIP SIDNEY.,richly-endowed genius.

6762,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.
6763,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,
6764,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,
6765,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"Robert Southwell was born in 1560, at St. Faith's, Norfolk. His parents"
6766,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"were Roman Catholics, and sent him when very young to be educated at the"
6767,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"English College of Douay, in Flanders. Thence he went to Borne, and when"
6768,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,sixteen years of age he joined the Society of the Jesuits--a strange bed
6769,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"for the rearing of a poet. In 1585, he was appointed Prefect of Studies,"
6770,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,and was soon after despatched as a missionary of his order to England.
6771,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"There, notwithstanding a law condemning to death all members of his"
6772,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"profession found in this country, he laboured on for eight years,"
6773,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"residing chiefly with Anne, Countess of Arundel, who died afterwards in"
6774,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"the Tower. In July 1592, Southwell was arrested in a gentleman's house"
6775,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,at Uxendon in Middlesex. He was thrust into a dungeon so filthy that
6776,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,when he was brought out to be examined his clothes were covered with
6777,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,vermin. This made his father--a man of good family--petition Queen
6778,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,Elizabeth that if his son was guilty of anything deserving death he
6779,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"might suffer it, but that, meanwhile, being a gentleman, he should be"
6780,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,treated as a gentleman. In consequence of this he was somewhat better
6781,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"lodged, but continued for nearly three years strictly confined to"
6782,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,prison; and as the Queen's agents imagined that he was in the secret of
6783,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"some conspiracies against the Government, he was put to the torture ten"
6784,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"times. In despair, he entreated to be brought to trial, whereupon Cecil"
6785,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"coolly remarked, 'that if he was in such haste to be hanged, he should"
6786,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"quickly have his desire.' On the 20th of February 1595, he was brought"
6787,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"to trial at King's Bench, and having confessed himself a Papist and a"
6788,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"Jesuit, he was condemned to death, and executed at Tyburn next day, with"
6789,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,all the nameless barbarities enjoined by the treason laws of these
6790,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,unhappy times. He is believed to have borne all his sufferings with
6791,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"unalterable serenity of mind and sweetness of temper. 'It is fitting,'"
6792,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"says Burke, 'that those made to suffer should suffer well.' And suffer"
6793,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"well throughout all his short life of sorrow, Southwell did."
6794,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,
6795,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"He was, undoubtedly, although in a false position, a true man, and a"
6796,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"true poet. To hope all things and believe all things, in reference to"
6797,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"a Jesuit, is a difficult task for Protestant charity. Yet what system"
6798,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,so vile but it has sometimes been gloriously misrepresented by its
6799,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,votaries? Who that ever read Edward Irving's 'Preface to Ben Ezra'--that
6800,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,modern Areopagitica--combining the essence of a hundred theological
6801,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,treatises with the spirit and grandeur of a Pindaric or Homeric ode--has
6802,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"forgot the pictures of Ben Ezra, or Lacunza the Jesuit? His work, 'The"
6803,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"Coming of the Messiah in Glory and Majesty,' Irving translated from"
6804,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"Spanish into his own noble English prose, and he describes the author as"
6805,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"a man of primitive manners, ardent piety, and enormous erudition, and"
6806,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"expresses a hope, long since we trust fulfilled, of meeting with the"
6807,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,'good old Jesuit' in a better world. To this probably small class of
6808,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"exceptions to a general rule (it surely is no uncharity to say this,"
6809,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,since the annals of Jesuitism have confessedly been so stained with
6810,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"falsehood, treachery, every insidious art, and every detestable crime)"
6811,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,seems to have belonged our poet. No proof was produced that he had any
6812,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"connexion with the treacherous and bloody designs of his party, although"
6813,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,he had plied his priestly labours with unwearied assiduity. He was too
6814,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,sincere-minded a man to have ever been admitted to the darker secrets of
6815,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,the Jesuits.
6816,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,
6817,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"His verses are ingenious, simpler in style than was common in his time"
6818,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"--distinguished here by homely picturesqueness, and there by solemn"
6819,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"moralising. A shade of deep but serene and unrepining sadness, connected"
6820,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"partly with his position and partly with his foreseen destiny, (his"
6821,ROBERT SOUTHWELL.,"larger works were written in prison,) rests on the most of his poems."

7054,WARWICK.,When Nature first in hand did take

7057,WARWICK.,"And was compell'd of very force,"
7058,WARWICK.,"With mould in hand, to flee to skies,"
7059,WARWICK.,To end the work she did devise.
7060,WARWICK.,
7061,WARWICK.,"The gods that then in council sate,"
7062,WARWICK.,"Were half-amazed, against their kind,[1]"
7063,WARWICK.,To see so near the stool of state
7064,WARWICK.,"Dame Nature stand, that was assign'd"
7065,WARWICK.,"Among her worldly imps[2] to wonne,[3]"
7066,WARWICK.,As she until that day had done.
7067,WARWICK.,
7068,WARWICK.,"First Jove began: 'What, daughter dear,"
7069,WARWICK.,Hath made thee scorn thy father's will?
7070,WARWICK.,"Why do I see thee, Nature, here,"
7071,WARWICK.,That ought'st of duty to fulfil
7072,WARWICK.,Thy undertaken charge at home?
7073,WARWICK.,What makes thee thus abroad to roam?
7074,WARWICK.,
7075,WARWICK.,"'Disdainful dame, how didst thou dare,"
7076,WARWICK.,So reckless to depart the ground
7077,WARWICK.,That is allotted to thy share?'
7078,WARWICK.,And therewithal his godhead frown'd.
7079,WARWICK.,"'I will,' quoth Nature, 'out of hand,"
7080,WARWICK.,Declare the cause I fled the land.
7081,WARWICK.,
7082,WARWICK.,'I undertook of late a piece
7083,WARWICK.,"Of clay a featured face to frame,"
7084,WARWICK.,"To match the courtly dames of Greece,"

7086,WARWICK.,"But, O good father, now I see"
7087,WARWICK.,This work of mine it will not be.
7088,WARWICK.,
7089,WARWICK.,"'Vicegerent, since you me assign'd"

7091,WARWICK.,"On mortal wights, and will'd that kind"
7092,WARWICK.,"Should make and mar, as she saw cause:"
7093,WARWICK.,"Of right, I think, I may appeal,"
7094,WARWICK.,And crave your help in this to deal.'
7095,WARWICK.,
7096,WARWICK.,"When Jove saw how the case did stand,"
7097,WARWICK.,"And that the work was well begun,"
7098,WARWICK.,He pray'd to have the helping hand
7099,WARWICK.,Of other gods till he had done:
7100,WARWICK.,"With willing minds they all agreed,"
7101,WARWICK.,And set upon the clay with speed.
7102,WARWICK.,
7103,WARWICK.,"First Jove each limb did well dispose,"
7104,WARWICK.,And makes a creature of the clay;
7105,WARWICK.,"Next, Lady Venus she bestows"
7106,WARWICK.,Her gallant gifts as best she may;
7107,WARWICK.,"From face to foot, from top to toe,"
7108,WARWICK.,She let no whit untouch'd to go.
7109,WARWICK.,
7110,WARWICK.,When Venus had done what she could
7111,WARWICK.,"In making of her carcase brave,"
7112,WARWICK.,Then Pallas thought she might be bold
7113,WARWICK.,Among the rest a share to have;
7114,WARWICK.,A passing wit she did convey
7115,WARWICK.,Into this passing piece of clay.
7116,WARWICK.,
7117,WARWICK.,"Of Bacchus she no member had,"
7118,WARWICK.,Save fingers fine and feat[4] to see;
7119,WARWICK.,"Her head with hair Apollo clad,"
7120,WARWICK.,That gods had thought it gold to be:
7121,WARWICK.,So glist'ring was the tress in sight
7122,WARWICK.,Of this new form'd and featured wight.
7123,WARWICK.,
7124,WARWICK.,"Diana held her peace a space,"
7125,WARWICK.,Until those other gods had done;
7126,WARWICK.,"'At last,' quoth she, 'in Dian's chase"
7127,WARWICK.,With bow in hand this nymph shall run;
7128,WARWICK.,And chief of all my noble train
7129,WARWICK.,I will this virgin entertain.'
7130,WARWICK.,
7131,WARWICK.,"Then joyful Juno came and said,"
7132,WARWICK.,"'Since you to her so friendly are,"
7133,WARWICK.,I do appoint this noble maid
7134,WARWICK.,To match with Mars his peer for war;
7135,WARWICK.,"She shall the Countess Warwick be,"
7136,WARWICK.,And yield Diana's bow to me.'
7137,WARWICK.,
7138,WARWICK.,"When to so good effect it came,"
7139,WARWICK.,"And every member had his grace,"
7140,WARWICK.,There wanted nothing but a name:
7141,WARWICK.,"By hap was Mercury then in place,"
7142,WARWICK.,"That said, 'I pray you all agree,"
7143,WARWICK.,Pandora grant her name to be.
7144,WARWICK.,
7145,WARWICK.,'For since your godheads forged have
7146,WARWICK.,"With one assent this noble dame,"
7147,WARWICK.,"And each to her a virtue gave,"
7148,WARWICK.,This term agreeth to the same.'
7149,WARWICK.,The gods that heard Mercurius tell
7150,WARWICK.,"This tale, did like it passing well."
7151,WARWICK.,
7152,WARWICK.,"Report was summon'd then in haste,"
7153,WARWICK.,"And will'd to bring his trump in hand,"
7154,WARWICK.,"To blow therewith a sounding blast,"
7155,WARWICK.,That might be heard through Brutus' land.

7632,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"This remarkable man, from his intimate connexion with Fletcher, is better"

7634,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"descended from an ancient family, which was settled at Grace Dieu in"
7635,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"Leicestershire. He was born in 1585-86, and educated at Cambridge. Thence"
7636,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"he passed to study in the Inner Temple, but seems to have preferred poetry"
7637,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,and the drama to law. He was married to the daughter of Sir Henry Isley of
7638,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"Kent, who bore him two daughters. He died in his 30th year, and was buried"
7639,FRANCIS BEAUMONT.,"March 9, 1615-16, in St Benedict's Chapel, Westminster Abbey. More of his"

7777,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"The verses attributed to this illustrious man are few, and the"
7778,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"authenticity of some of them is doubtful. No one, however, who has"
7779,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"studied his career, or read his 'History of the World,' can deny him"
7780,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the title of a great poet.
7781,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7782,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"We cannot be expected, in a work of the present kind, to enlarge on a"
7783,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"career so well known as that of Sir Walter Kaleigh. He was born in 1552,"
7784,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"at Hayes Farm, in Devonshire, and descended from an old family there. He"
7785,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"went early to Oxford, but finding its pursuits too tame for his active"
7786,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and enterprising spirit, he left it, and became a soldier at seventeen."
7787,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"For six years he fought on the Protestant side in France, besides serving"
7788,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"a campaign in the Netherlands. In 1579, he went a voyage, which proved"
7789,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"disastrous, to Newfoundland, in company with his half-brother, Sir"
7790,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Humphrey Gilbert. There can be no doubt that this early apprenticeship
7791,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,to war and navigation was of material service to the future explorer and
7792,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"historian. In 1580, he fought in Ireland against the Earl of Desmond,"
7793,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"who had raised a rebellion there, and on one occasion is said to have"
7794,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"defended a ford of Shannon against a whole band of wild Irish rebels,"
7795,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,till the stream ran purple with their blood and his own. With the Lord-
7796,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Deputy, Lord Grey de Wilton, he got into a dispute, and to settle it came"
7797,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"over to England. Here high favour awaited him. His handsome appearance,"
7798,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"his graceful address, his ready wit and chivalric courtesy, dashed with"
7799,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"a fine poetic enthusiasm, (see them admirably pictured in 'Kenilworth,')"
7800,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,combined to exalt him in the estimation of Queen Elizabeth. On one
7801,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"occasion he flung his rich plush cloak over a miry part of the way, that"
7802,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,she might pass on unsoiled. By this delicate piece of enacted flattery he
7803,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'spoiled a cloak and made a fortune.' The Queen sent him, along with some"
7804,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"other courtiers, to attend the Duke of Anjou, who had in vain solicited"
7805,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"her hand, back to the Netherlands. In 1584, he fitted two ships, and sent"
7806,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,them out for the discovery and settlement of those parts of North America
7807,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"not already appropriated by Christian states, and the next year there"
7808,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,followed a fleet of seven ships under the command of Sir Richard
7809,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Grenville, Raleigh's kinsman. The attempt to colonise America at that"
7810,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"time failed, but two important things were transplanted through means of"
7811,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the expedition from Virginia to Britain, namely, tobacco and the potato,"
7812,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,--the former of which has ever since been offered up in smoky sacrifice to
7813,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Raleigh's memory throughout the whole world, and the latter of which has"
7814,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,become the most valuable of all our vegetable esculents. Raleigh first
7815,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"planted the potato in Ireland, a country of which it has long been the"
7816,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,principal food. A ludicrous story is told about this. It is said that he
7817,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"had invited a number of his neighbours to an entertainment, in which the"
7818,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"new root was to form a prominent part, but when the feast began Raleigh"
7819,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"found, to his horror, that the servants had boiled the plums, a most"
7820,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"unsavoury mess, and immediately, we suppose, 'tabulae solvuntur risu.'"
7821,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"In 1584 the Queen had knighted him, and shortly after she granted him"
7822,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"certain lucrative monopolies, and an estate in Ireland, in addition to"
7823,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"one he had possessed for some years. In 1588, he was of material service"
7824,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"as one of Her Majesty's Council of War, formed to resist the Spanish"
7825,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Armada, and as one of the volunteers who joined the English fleet with"
7826,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,ships of their own. Next year he accompanied a number of his countrymen
7827,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"in an expedition, which had it in view to restore Don Antonio to the"
7828,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"throne of Portugal, of which the Spaniards had deprived him. On his"
7829,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"return he lost caste considerably, both with the Queen and country, by"
7830,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"taking bribes, and otherwise abusing the influence he had acquired at"
7831,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Court. Yet, about this time, his active mind was projecting what he"
7832,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"called an 'Office of Address,'--a plan for facilitating the designs of"
7833,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"literary and scientific men, promoting intercourse between them, gaining,"
7834,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"in short, all those objects which are now secured by our literary"
7835,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,associations and philosophical societies. Raleigh was eminently a man
7836,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"before his age, but, alas! his age was too far behind him."
7837,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7838,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"While visiting Ireland, after his expedition to Portugal, he contracted"
7839,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"an intimacy with Spenser. (See our 'Life of Spenser,' vol. ii.) In 1592,"
7840,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"he commanded a large naval expedition, destined to attack Panama and"
7841,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"intercept the Spanish Plate-fleet, but was recalled by the Queen, not,"
7842,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"however, till he had seized on an important prize, and, in common"
7843,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"parlance, had 'feathered his nest.' On his return he excited Her"
7844,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Majesty's wrath, by an intrigue with Elizabeth Throgmorton, one of the"
7845,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"maids of honour, and, although Raleigh afterwards married her, the Queen"
7846,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,imprisoned both the offending parties for some months in the Tower.
7847,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Spenser is believed to allude to this in the 4th Book of his great poem.
7848,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"(See vol. in. of our edition, p. 88.) Even after he was released from"
7849,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the Tower, Raleigh had to leave the Court in disgrace; instead, however,"
7850,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"of wasting time in vain regrets, he undertook, at his own expense, an"
7851,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"expedition against Guiana, where he captured the city of San Joseph, and"
7852,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,which he occupied in the Queen's name. After his return he published an
7853,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"account of his expedition, more distinguished by glowing eloquence than"
7854,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"by rigid regard to truth. In 1596, having in some measure regained the"
7855,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Queen's favour, he was appointed to a command in the expedition against"
7856,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Cadiz, under the Earl of Essex. In this, as well as in the expedition"
7857,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"against the Spanish Plate-fleet the next year, he won laurels, but was"
7858,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,unfortunate enough to excite the jealousy of his Commander-in-Chief.
7859,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"When the favourite got into trouble, Raleigh eagerly joined in the hunt,"
7860,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"wrote a letter to Cecil urging him to the destruction of Essex, and"
7861,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,witnessed his execution from a window in the Armoury. This is
7862,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,undoubtedly a deep blot on the escutcheon of our hero.
7863,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7864,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Cecil had been glad of Raleigh's aid in ruining Essex, but he bore him"
7865,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"no good-will otherwise, and is said to have poisoned James, who now"
7866,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"succeeded to the English throne, against him. Assuredly the new King was"
7867,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"no friend of Raleigh's. Stimulated by Cecil, after first depriving him"
7868,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"of his office of Captain of the Guards, he brought him to trial for high"
7869,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"treason. He was accused of conspiring to establish Popery, to dethrone"
7870,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the King, and to put the crown on the head of Arabella Stewart. Sir"
7871,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Edward Coke, the Attorney-General, led the accusation, and disgraced"
7872,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"himself by heaping on Raleigh's head every foul epithet, calling him"
7873,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'viper,' 'damnable atheist,' 'monster,' 'traitor,' 'spider of hell,'"
7874,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"&c., and by his violence, although to his own surprise, as he never"
7875,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"expected to gain his cause in full, he browbeat the jury to bring in a"
7876,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,verdict of high treason.
7877,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7878,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Raleigh's defence was a masterpiece of temper, dignity, strength of"
7879,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"reasoning, and eloquence, and his enemies were ashamed of the decision"
7880,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"to which they had driven the jury. He was therefore reprieved, and"
7881,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"committed to the Tower, where his wife was allowed to bear him company,"
7882,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and where his youngest son was born. His estates were, in general,"
7883,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"preserved to him, but Carr, the infamous minion of the King, under some"
7884,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"pretext of a flaw in the conveyance of it by Raleigh to his son, seized"
7885,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,upon his manor of Sherborne. In the Tower he continued for twelve years.
7886,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,These years his industry and genius rendered the happiest probably of
7887,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,his life. Immured in the
7888,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7889,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'towers of Julius, London's lasting shame,"
7890,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"By many a foul and midnight murder fed,'"
7891,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7892,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"his winged soul soared away, like the dove of the Deluge, over the wild"
7893,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"ocean of the past. The Tower confined his body, but this great globe the"
7894,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,world seemed too little for the sweep of his spirit. To fill up the vast
7895,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"void which a long imprisonment created around him, and to shew that his"
7896,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"powers retained all their elasticity, he projected a work on the largest"
7897,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"scale, and with the noblest purpose--'The History of the World.' In this"
7898,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,undertaking he found literary men ready to lend him their aid. A hundred
7899,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"hands were generously stretched out to gather materials, and to bring"
7900,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,them to the captive in the Tower. Cart-loads of books were sent. One
7901,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Burrell, formerly his chaplain, assisted him in much of the critical and"
7902,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,chronological drudgery. Rugged Ben Jonson sent in a piece of rugged
7903,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"writing on the Punic War, which Raleigh polished and set as a carved"
7904,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"stone in his magnificent temple. Some have, on this account, sought to"
7905,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,detract from the merit of the author. As if ever an architect could rear
7906,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,a building without hodmen! But in Raleigh's case the hodmen were Titans.
7907,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,'The best wits in England assisted him in his undertaking;' and what a
7908,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,compliment was this to the strength and stature of the master-builder!
7909,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7910,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,This great work was never finished. The part completed comprehended only
7911,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the period from the Creation to the Downfall of the Macedonian Empire
7912,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,--one hundred and seventy years before Christ. He tarries too long amidst
7913,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the misty and mythical ages which precede the dawn of history; his
7914,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"speculations on the site of the original Paradise, on the Flood, &c.,"
7915,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,are more ingenious than instructive; but his descriptions of the Greek
7916,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"battles--his account of the rise of Rome--the extensive erudition, on"
7917,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"all subjects displayed in the book--the many acute, profound, and"
7918,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,eloquently-expressed observations which are sprinkled throughout--and
7919,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the style, massive, dignified, rich, and less involved in structure than"
7920,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,that of almost any of his contemporaries--shall always rank it amongst
7921,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the great literary treasures of the language. It was published in 1614.
7922,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Besides it, Raleigh was the author of various works, all full of"
7923,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"sagacious thought and brilliant imagery, such as 'The Advice to a Son on"
7924,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the Choice of a Wife,' 'The Sceptic,' 'Maxims of State,' &c. At last he"
7925,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"was released by the advance of a large sum of money to Villiers, Duke of"
7926,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Buckingham, James's favourite; and, to retrieve his fortunes, projected"
7927,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"another expedition to America. James granted him a patent, under the"
7928,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Great Seal, for making a settlement in Guiana, but ungenerously did not"
7929,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,grant him a pardon for the sentence which had been passed on him for
7930,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"treason. He set sail, 1617, in a ship built by himself, called the"
7931,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"_Destiny_, with eleven other vessels. Having reached the Orinoco, he"
7932,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,despatched a portion of his forces to attack the new Spanish settlement
7933,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"of St Thomas. This was captured, with the loss of Raleigh's eldest son."
7934,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"The expected plunder, however, proved of little value; and Sir Walter"
7935,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,having in vain attempted to induce his captains to attack other
7936,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"settlements of the Spaniards, was compelled to return home--his golden"
7937,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"dreams dissolved, and his prophetic soul forewarning him of the doom"
7938,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"that awaited him on his native shores. In July 1618, he landed at"
7939,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Plymouth; 'whence,' says Howell, in his 'Familiar Letters,' 'he thought"
7940,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"to make an escape, and some say he tampered with his body by physic to"
7941,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"make him look sickly, that he might be the more pitied, and permitted to"
7942,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,lie in his own house.' James was at this time seeking the hand of the
7943,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Infanta for his son Charles, and was naturally disposed to side with the"
7944,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Spanish cause. He was, besides, stirred up by the Spanish ambassador,"
7945,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Count Gondomar, who sent to desire an audience with His Majesty, and"
7946,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"said, that he had only one word to say to him. 'The King wondered what"
7947,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"could be delivered in one word, whereupon, when he came before him, he"
7948,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"said only, ""Pirates! pirates! pirates!"" and so departed.'"
7949,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7950,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Raleigh consequently was arrested and sent back to his old lodgings in
7951,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the Tower. He was not tried, as might have been expected, for the new"
7952,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"offence of waging war against a power then at amity with England, but"
7953,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"James, with consummate meanness and cruelty, determined to revive his"
7954,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"former sentence. He was brought before the King's Bench, where his old"
7955,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"enemy, Sir Edward Coke, now sat as Chief Justice, and officially"
7956,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"condemned him to death. His language, however, was considerably modified"
7957,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"to the prisoner. He said, 'I know you have been valiant and wise, and I"
7958,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"doubt not but you retain both these virtues, for now you shall have"
7959,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"occasion to use them. Your faith hath heretofore been questioned, but I"
7960,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"am resolved you are a good Christian; for your book, which is an"
7961,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"admirable work, doth testify as much. I would give you counsel, but I"
7962,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,know you can apply unto yourself far better than I can give you. Yet
7963,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"will I (with the good neighbour in the Gospel, who, finding one in the"
7964,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"way wounded and distressed, poured oil into his wounds and refreshed"
7965,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"him) give unto you the oil of comfort, though, in respect that I am a"
7966,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"minister of the law, mixed with vinegar.' Such was Coke's comfort to the"
7967,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,brave and gifted man who stood untrembling before his bar.
7968,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7969,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"On the 26th of October 1618, the day after his condemnation, Raleigh was"
7970,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,beheaded. He met his fate with dignity and composure. Having addressed
7971,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the multitude in vindication of his conduct, he took up the axe, and"
7972,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"said to the sheriff, 'This is a sharp medicine, but a sound cure for all"
7973,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,diseases.' He told the executioner that he would give the signal by
7974,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"lifting up his hand, and 'then,' he said, 'fear not, but strike home.'"
7975,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"He next laid himself down, but was asked by the executioner to alter the"
7976,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"position of the head. 'So the heart be right,' he replied, 'it is no"
7977,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,matter which way the head lies.' The headsman became uncertain and
7978,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"tremulous when the signal was given, whereupon Ealeigh exclaimed, 'Why"
7979,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"dost thou not strike? Strike, man!' and by two blows that gallant,"
7980,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"witty, and richly-stored head was severed from the body. He was in his"
7981,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,sixty-fifth year. He had the night before composed the following verse:--
7982,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7983,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Even such is Time, that takes on trust"
7984,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Our youth, our joys, our all we have,"
7985,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,And pays us but with age and dust;
7986,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Who in the dark and silent grave,"
7987,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"When we have wander'd all our ways,"
7988,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Shuts up the story of our days.'
7989,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,
7990,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,Thus perished Sir Walter Raleigh. There has been ever one opinion as to
7991,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the breadth and brilliance of his genius. His powers were almost
7992,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,universal in their range. He commented on Scripture with the ingenuity
7993,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"of a Talmudist, and wrote love verses (see the lines in Campbell's"
7994,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'Specimens,' entitled 'Dulcina') with the animus and graceful levity of"
7995,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,a Thomas Moore. He was deep at once in 'all the learning of the
7996,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Egyptians,' and in that of the Greeks and Romans. In his large mind lay"
7997,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"dreams of golden lands, which even Australia has not yet fully verified,"
7998,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,alongside of maxims of the most practical wisdom. He was learned in all
7999,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,that had been; well-informed as to all that was; and speculative and
8000,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,hopeful as to all that might be and was yet to be. Disgust at the
8001,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"scholastic methods, blended with the adventurous character of his mind,"
8002,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and perhaps also with some looseness of moral principle, led him at one"
8003,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"time to the brink of universal scepticism; but disappointment, sorrow,"
8004,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and the solitude of the Tower, made him a sadder and wiser man, and he"
8005,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,returned to the verities of the Christian religion. The stains on his
8006,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"character seem to have arisen chiefly from his position. He was, like"
8007,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"some greater and some smaller men of eminence, undoubtedly, to a certain"
8008,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"extent, a brilliant adventurer--a class to whom justice is seldom done,"
8009,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"and against whom every calumny is believed. He was a _novus homo_, in an"
8010,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"age of more than common aristocratic pretence; sprang, indeed, from an"
8011,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"ancient family, but possessing nothing himself, save his cloak, his"
8012,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"sword, his tact, and his genius. We all know how, in later times, such"
8013,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"spirits, kindred in many points to Raleigh, in some superior, and in"
8014,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"others inferior--as Burke, Sheridan, and Canning--were used, less for"
8015,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"their errors of temper or of life, than because they had gained immense"
8016,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"influence, not by birth or favour, but by the force of extraordinary"
8017,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"talent and no less remarkable address. Raleigh, however, was undoubtedly"
8018,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,imprudent in a high degree. He had once or twice outraged common
8019,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,morality; his enemies were constantly accusing him of gasconading and of
8020,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'pride.' His success at first was too early and too easy, and hence a"
8021,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,reverse might have been anticipated as certain and as remarkable as his
8022,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,rise had been. His fall ultimately is understood to have been
8023,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"precipitated by the base complicity of James with the Spaniards, who"
8024,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"were informed by the King of Raleigh's motions in America, and prepared"
8025,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"to counteract them, as well as by the loud-sounding invectives and legal"
8026,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,lies of the unscrupulous instruments of his tyrannical power. With all
8027,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"his faults and follies, (of 'crimes,' it has been justly said, Raleigh"
8028,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"can hardly be accused,) he stood high in that crowd of giants who"
8029,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"illustrated the reign of the Amazonian Queen. What an age it was! Bacon,"
8030,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"with still brighter powers, and far darker and meaner faults than"
8031,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"Raleigh, was sitting on the woolsack in body, while his spirit was"
8032,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"presiding over the half-born philosophies of the future, and beholding"
8033,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,the cold rod of Induction blossom in an after-day into the Aaronic
8034,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,flowers and fruits of a magnificent science; Cecil was nodding out
8035,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,wisdom or transcendental craft in the Cabinet; Sir Philip Sidney was
8036,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,carrying the spirit of 'Arcadia' into the field of battle; Spenser was
8037,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,dreaming his one beautiful lifelong Dream; and Shakspeare was holding up
8038,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"his calm mirror to the heart of man and the universe of nature; while,"
8039,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"on the prow of the British vessel, carrying on those lofty spirits and"
8040,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"enterprises, there appeared a daring mariner, the Poet and 'Shepherd of"
8041,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the Ocean,' with bright eye, sanguine countenance, step treading the"
8042,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"deck like a throne, and look contemplating the sunset, as if it were the"
8043,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"dawning, and the Evening, as if it were the Morning Star. It was the"
8044,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"hopeful and the brilliant Raleigh, who, while he 'opened up to Europe"
8045,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"the New World, was the historian of the Old.' Alas that this illustrious"
8046,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,"'Marinere' was doomed to a life so troubled and a death so dreadful, and"
8047,SIR WALTER RALEIGH.,that the glory of one of England's prodigies is for ever bound up with

8193,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,
8194,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"Joshua Sylvester is the next in the list of our imperfectly-known, but"
8195,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,real poets. Very little is known of his history. He was a merchant-
8196,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"adventurer, and died at Middleburg, aged fifty-five, in 1618. He is said"
8197,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"to have applied, in 1597, for the office of secretary to a trading"
8198,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"company in Stade, and to have been, on this occasion, patronised by"
8199,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,the Earl of Essex. He was at one time attached to the English Court as
8200,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,a pensioner of Prince Henry. He is said to have been driven abroad by
8201,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,the severity of his satires. He seems to have had a sweet flow of
8202,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"conversational eloquence, and hence was called 'The Silver-tongued.' He"
8203,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"was an eminent linguist, and wrote his dedications in various languages."
8204,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"He published a large volume of poems, very unequal in their value, and"
8205,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"inserted in it 'The Soul's Errand,' with interpolations, as we have seen,"
8206,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,which prove it not to be his own. His great work is the translation of
8207,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"the 'Divine Weeks and Works' of the French poet, Du Bartas, which is a"
8208,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,marvellous medley of flatness and force--of childish weakness and soaring
8209,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"genius--with more _seed poetry_ in it than any poem we remember, except"
8210,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"'Festus,' the chaos of a hundred poetic worlds. There can be little doubt"
8211,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"that Milton was familiar with this work in boyhood, and many remarkable"
8212,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,coincidences have been pointed out between it and 'Paradise Lost.'
8213,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"Sylvester was a Puritan, and his publisher, Humphrey Lownes, who lived"
8214,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"in the same street with Milton's father, belonged to the same sect; and,"
8215,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"as Campbell remarks, 'it is easily to be conceived that Milton often"
8216,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"repaired to the shop of Lownes, and there met with the pious didactic"
8217,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"poem.' The work, therefore, some specimens of which we subjoin, is"
8218,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,"interesting, both in itself, and as having been the _prima stamina_ of"
8219,JOSHUA SYLVESTER.,the great masterpiece of English poetry.

8453,ALEXANDER HUME.,"This Scottish poet was the second son of Patrick, fifth Baron of"
8454,ALEXANDER HUME.,"Polwarth. He was born about the middle of the sixteenth century, and"
8455,ALEXANDER HUME.,"died in 1609. He resided for some years, in the early part of his life,"
8456,ALEXANDER HUME.,"in France. Returning home, he studied law, and then tried his fortune at"
8457,ALEXANDER HUME.,"Court. Here he was eclipsed by a rival, named Montgomery; and after"
8458,ALEXANDER HUME.,"assailing his rival, who rejoined, in verse, he became a clergyman in"
8459,ALEXANDER HUME.,"disgust, and was settled in the parish of Logie. Here he darkened into"
8460,ALEXANDER HUME.,"a sour and savage Calvinist, and uttered an exhortation to the youth of"
8461,ALEXANDER HUME.,"Scotland to forego the admiration of classical heroes, and to read no"
8462,ALEXANDER HUME.,"love-poetry save the 'Song of Solomon.' In another poetic walk, however,"
8463,ALEXANDER HUME.,"that of natural description, Hume excelled, and we print with pleasure"
8464,ALEXANDER HUME.,"some parts of his 'Summer's Day,' which our readers may compare with Mr"

8789,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"This ingenious person was born in 1562, near Taunton, in Somersetshire."
8790,SAMUEL DANIEL.,His father was a music-master. He was patronised by the noble family
8791,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"of Pembroke, who probably also maintained him at college. He went to"
8792,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Magdalene Hall, Oxford, in 1579; and after studying there, chiefly"
8793,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"history and poetry, for seven years, he left without a degree. When"
8794,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"twenty-three years of age, he translated Paulus Jovius' 'Discourse of"
8795,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Rare Inventions.' He became tutor to Lady Anne Clifford, the elegant"
8796,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"and accomplished daughter of the Earl of Cumberland. She, at his death,"
8797,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"raised a monument to his memory, and recorded on it, with pride, that"
8798,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"she had been his pupil. After Spenser died, Daniel became a 'voluntary"
8799,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"laureat' to the Court, producing masques and pageants, but was soon"
8800,SAMUEL DANIEL.,supplanted by 'rare Ben Jonson.' In 1603 he was appointed Master of the
8801,SAMUEL DANIEL.,Queen's Revels and Inspector of the Plays to be enacted by juvenile
8802,SAMUEL DANIEL.,performers. He was also promoted to be Gentleman Extraordinary and Groom
8803,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"of the Chambers to the Queen. He was a varied and voluminous writer,"
8804,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"composing plays, miscellaneous poems, and prose compositions, including"
8805,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"a 'Defence of Rhyme' and a 'History of England,'--an honest, but somewhat"
8806,SAMUEL DANIEL.,dry and dull production. While composing his works he resided in Old
8807,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Street, St Luke's, which was then thought a suburban residence; but he"
8808,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"was often in town, and mingled on intimate terms with Selden and"
8809,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Shakspeare. When approaching sixty, he took a farm at Beckington, in"
8810,SAMUEL DANIEL.,Somersetshire--his native shire--and died there in 1619.
8811,SAMUEL DANIEL.,
8812,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"Daniel's Plays and History are now, as wholes, forgotten, although the"
8813,SAMUEL DANIEL.,"former contained some vigorous passages, such as Richard II.'s soliloquy"
8814,SAMUEL DANIEL.,on the morning of his murder in Pomfret Castle. His smaller pieces and
8815,SAMUEL DANIEL.,his Sonnets shew no ordinary poetic powers.

8947,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"This knight, says Campbell, 'wrote, at twenty-five years of age, a poem"
8948,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"on the ""Immortality of the Soul,"" and at fifty-two, when he was a judge"
8949,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"and a statesman, another on the ""_Art of Dancing_.""  Well might the"
8950,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"teacher of that noble accomplishment, in Molière's comedy, exclaim, ""_La"
8951,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"philosophie est quelque chose--mais la danse!_""  This, however, is more"
8952,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"pointed than correct, since the first of these poems was written in"
8953,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"1592, when the author was only twenty-two years of age, and the latter"
8954,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"appeared in 1599, when he was only twenty-nine."
8955,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,
8956,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Tisbury, in Wiltshire, was the birthplace of this poet, and 1570 the"
8957,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,date of his birth. His father was a practising lawyer. John was expelled
8958,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"from the Temple for beating one Richard Martyn, afterwards Recorder, but"
8959,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"was restored, and subsequently elected for Parliament. In 1592, as"
8960,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"aforesaid, appeared his poem, 'Nosce Teipsum; or, The Immortality of the"
8961,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Soul.' Its fame soon travelled to Scotland; and when Davies, along with"
8962,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Lord Hunsdon, visited that country, James received him most graciously"
8963,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"as the author of 'Nosce Teipsum.' His history became, for some time, a"
8964,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"list of promotions. He was appointed, in 1603, first Solicitor and then"
8965,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Attorney-General in Ireland, was next made Sergeant, was then knighted,"
8966,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"then appointed King's Sergeant, next elected representative of the"
8967,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"county of Fermanagh, and, in fine, after a violent contest between the"
8968,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Roman Catholic and Protestant parties, was chosen Speaker of the House"
8969,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,of Commons in the Protestant interest. While in Ireland he married
8970,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"Eleanor, a daughter of Lord Audley, who turned out a raving prophetess,"
8971,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"and was sent, in 1649, to the Tower, and then to Bethlehem Hospital, by"
8972,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"the Revolutionary Government. In 1616, Sir John returned to England,"
8973,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"continued to practise as a barrister, sat in Parliament for Newcastle-"
8974,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"under-Lyne, and received a promise of being made Chief-Justice of"
8975,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,England; but was suddenly cut off by apoplexy in 1626.

8977,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"His poem on dancing, which was written in fifteen days, and left a"

8980,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,demonstrative argument on the grand and difficult problem of
8981,SIR JOHN DAVIES.,"immortality, is full of ingenuity, and has many apt and memorable"

9407,GILES FLETCHER.,"Giles Fletcher was the younger brother of Phineas, and died twenty-three"
9408,GILES FLETCHER.,"years before him. He was a cousin of Fletcher the dramatist, and the son"
9409,GILES FLETCHER.,"of Dr Giles Fletcher, who was employed in many important missions in the"
9410,GILES FLETCHER.,"reign of Queen Elizabeth, and, among others, negotiated a commercial"
9411,GILES FLETCHER.,treaty with Russia greatly in the favour of his own country. Giles is
9412,GILES FLETCHER.,supposed to have been born in 1588. He studied at Cambridge; published his
9413,GILES FLETCHER.,"noble poem, 'Christ's Victory and Triumph,' in 1610, when he was twenty-"
9414,GILES FLETCHER.,"three years of age; was appointed to the living of Alderston, in Suffolk,"
9415,GILES FLETCHER.,"where he died, in 1623, at the early age of thirty-five, 'equally loved,'"
9416,GILES FLETCHER.,"says old Wood, 'of the Muses and the Graces.'"
9417,GILES FLETCHER.,
9418,GILES FLETCHER.,"The poem, in four cantos, entitled 'Christ's Victory and Triumph,' is one"
9419,GILES FLETCHER.,"of almost Miltonic magnificence. With a wing as easy as it is strong, he"
9420,GILES FLETCHER.,"soars to heaven, and fills the austere mouth of Justice and the golden"
9421,GILES FLETCHER.,lips of Mercy with language worthy of both. He then stoops down on the
9422,GILES FLETCHER.,"Wilderness of the Temptation, and paints the Saviour and Satan in colours"
9423,GILES FLETCHER.,"admirably contrasted, and which in their brightness and blackness can"
9424,GILES FLETCHER.,"never decay. Nor does he fear, in fine, to pierce the gloom of Calvary,"
9425,GILES FLETCHER.,"and to mingle his note with the harps of angels, saluting the Redeemer, as"
9426,GILES FLETCHER.,"He sprang from the grave, with the song, 'He is risen, He is risen--and"
9427,GILES FLETCHER.,"shall die no more.' The style is steeped in Spenser--equally mellifluous,"
9428,GILES FLETCHER.,"figurative, and majestic. In allegory the author of the 'Fairy Queen' is"
9429,GILES FLETCHER.,"hardly superior, and in the enthusiasm of devotion Fletcher surpasses him"
9430,GILES FLETCHER.,"far. From the great light, thus early kindled and early quenched, Milton"
9431,GILES FLETCHER.,did not disdain to draw with his 'golden urn.' 'Paradise Regained' owes
9432,GILES FLETCHER.,much more than the suggestion of its subject to 'Christ's Victory;' and is
9433,GILES FLETCHER.,"it too much to say that, had Fletcher lived, he might have shone in the"
9434,GILES FLETCHER.,same constellation with the bard of the 'Paradise Lost?' The plan of our
9435,GILES FLETCHER.,"'Specimens' permits only a few extracts. Let those who wish more, along"
9436,GILES FLETCHER.,"with a lengthened and glowing tribute to the author's genius, consult"
9437,GILES FLETCHER.,_Blackwood_ for November 1835. The reading of a single sentence will
9438,GILES FLETCHER.,convince them that the author of the paper was Christopher North.

9833,JOHN DONNE.,
9834,JOHN DONNE.,"John Donne was born in London, in the year 1573. He sprung from a"
9835,JOHN DONNE.,"Catholic family, and his mother was related to Sir Thomas More and to"
9836,JOHN DONNE.,Heywood the epigrammatist. He was very early distinguished as a prodigy
9837,JOHN DONNE.,"of boyish acquirement, and was entered, when only eleven, of Harthall,"
9838,JOHN DONNE.,"now Hertford College. He was designed for the law, but relinquished the"
9839,JOHN DONNE.,"study when he reached nineteen. About the same time, having studied the"
9840,JOHN DONNE.,"controversies between the Papists and Protestants, he deliberately went"
9841,JOHN DONNE.,"over to the latter. He next accompanied the Earl of Essex to Cadiz, and"
9842,JOHN DONNE.,"looked wistfully over the gulf dividing him from Jerusalem, with all its"
9843,JOHN DONNE.,"holy memories, to which his heart had been translated from very boyhood."
9844,JOHN DONNE.,"He even meditated a journey to the Holy Land, but was discouraged by"
9845,JOHN DONNE.,reports as to the dangers of the way. On his return he was received by
9846,JOHN DONNE.,the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere into his own house as his secretary. Here
9847,JOHN DONNE.,"he fell in love with Miss More, the daughter of Sir George More, Lord-"
9848,JOHN DONNE.,"Lieutenant of the Tower, and the niece of the Chancellor. His passion"
9849,JOHN DONNE.,"was returned, and the pair were imprudent enough to marry privately."
9850,JOHN DONNE.,"When the matter became known, the father-in-law became infuriated. He"
9851,JOHN DONNE.,"prevailed on Lord Ellesmere to drive Donne out of his service, and had"
9852,JOHN DONNE.,him even for a short time imprisoned. Even when released he continued in
9853,JOHN DONNE.,"a pitiable plight, and but for the kindness of Sir Francis Wooley, a son"
9854,JOHN DONNE.,"of Lady Ellesmere by a former marriage, who received the young couple"
9855,JOHN DONNE.,"into his family and entertained them for years, they would have"
9856,JOHN DONNE.,perished.
9857,JOHN DONNE.,
9858,JOHN DONNE.,"When Donne reached the age of thirty-four, Dr Merton, afterwards Bishop"
9859,JOHN DONNE.,"of Durham, urged him to take orders, and offered him a benefice, which"
9860,JOHN DONNE.,"he was generously to relinquish in his favour. Donne declined, on"
9861,JOHN DONNE.,"account, he said, of some past errors of life, which, 'though repented"
9862,JOHN DONNE.,"of and pardoned by God, might not be forgotten by men, and might cast"
9863,JOHN DONNE.,dishonour on the sacred office.'
9864,JOHN DONNE.,
9865,JOHN DONNE.,"When Sir F. Wooley died, Sir Robert Drury became his next protector."
9866,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne attended him on an embassy to France, and his wife formed the"
9867,JOHN DONNE.,romantic purpose of accompanying her husband in the disguise of a page.
9868,JOHN DONNE.,Here was a wife fit for a poet! In order to restrain her from her
9869,JOHN DONNE.,"purpose, he had to address to her some verses, commencing,"
9870,JOHN DONNE.,
9871,JOHN DONNE.,'By our strange and fatal interview.'
9872,JOHN DONNE.,
9873,JOHN DONNE.,"Isaak Walton relates how the poet, one evening, as he sat alone in"
9874,JOHN DONNE.,"Paris, saw his wife appearing to him in vision, with a dead infant in"
9875,JOHN DONNE.,her arms--a proof at once of the strength of his love and of his
9876,JOHN DONNE.,"imagination. This beloved and admirable woman died in 1617, a few days"
9877,JOHN DONNE.,"after giving birth to her twelfth child, and Donne's grief approached"
9878,JOHN DONNE.,distraction.
9879,JOHN DONNE.,
9880,JOHN DONNE.,"When he had reached the forty-second year of his age, our poet, at the"
9881,JOHN DONNE.,"instance of King James, became a clergyman, and was successively"
9882,JOHN DONNE.,"appointed Chaplain to the King, Lecturer to Lincoln's Inn, Dean of St"
9883,JOHN DONNE.,"Dunstan's in the West, and Dean of St Paul's. In the pulpit he attracted"
9884,JOHN DONNE.,"great attention, particularly from the more thoughtful and intelligent"
9885,JOHN DONNE.,"of his auditors. He continued Dean of St Paul's till his death, which"
9886,JOHN DONNE.,"took place in 1631, when he was approaching sixty. He died of consumption,"
9887,JOHN DONNE.,a disease which seldom cuts down a man so near his grand climacteric.
9888,JOHN DONNE.,
9889,JOHN DONNE.,"'He was buried,' says Campbell, 'in St Paul's, where his figure yet"
9890,JOHN DONNE.,"remains in the vault of St Faith's, carved from a painting, for which he"
9891,JOHN DONNE.,"sat a few days' (it should be weeks) 'before his death, dressed in his"
9892,JOHN DONNE.,winding-sheet.' He kept this portrait constantly by his bedside to
9893,JOHN DONNE.,remind him of his mortality.
9894,JOHN DONNE.,
9895,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne's Sermons fill a large folio, with which we were familiar in"
9896,JOHN DONNE.,"boyhood, but have not seen since. De Quincey says, alluding partly"
9897,JOHN DONNE.,"to them, and partly to his poetry,--'Few writers have shewn a more"
9898,JOHN DONNE.,"extraordinary compass of powers than Donne, for he combined--what no"
9899,JOHN DONNE.,other man has ever done--the last sublimation of dialectical subtlety
9900,JOHN DONNE.,and address with the most impassioned majesty. Massy diamonds compose
9901,JOHN DONNE.,"the very substance of his poem on the 'Metempsychosis,'--thoughts and"
9902,JOHN DONNE.,descriptions which have the fervent and gloomy sublimity of Ezekiel or
9903,JOHN DONNE.,Aeschylus; while a diamond-dust of rhetorical brilliances is strewed
9904,JOHN DONNE.,over the whole of his occasional verses and his prose.' We beg leave
9905,JOHN DONNE.,"to differ, in some degree, from De Quincey in his estimate of the"
9906,JOHN DONNE.,"'Metempsychosis,' or 'The Progress of the Soul,' although we have given"
9907,JOHN DONNE.,"it entire. It has too many far-fetched conceits and obscure allegories,"
9908,JOHN DONNE.,"although redeemed, we admit, by some very precious thoughts, such as"
9909,JOHN DONNE.,
9910,JOHN DONNE.,"'This soul, to whom Luther and Mahomet were Prisons of flesh.'"
9911,JOHN DONNE.,
9912,JOHN DONNE.,Or the following quaint picture of the apple in Eden--
9913,JOHN DONNE.,
9914,JOHN DONNE.,"'Prince of the orchard, fair as dawning morn,"
9915,JOHN DONNE.,"Fenced with the law, and ripe as soon as born.'"
9916,JOHN DONNE.,
9917,JOHN DONNE.,Or this--
9918,JOHN DONNE.,
9919,JOHN DONNE.,"'Nature hath no jail, though she hath law.'"
9920,JOHN DONNE.,
9921,JOHN DONNE.,"If our readers, however, can admire the account the poet gives of Abel"
9922,JOHN DONNE.,"and his bitch, or see any resemblance to the severe and simple grandeur"
9923,JOHN DONNE.,of Aeschylus and Ezekiel in the description of the soul informing a
9924,JOHN DONNE.,"body, made of a '_female fish's sandy roe' 'newly leavened with the"
9925,JOHN DONNE.,"male's jelly_,' we shall say no more."
9926,JOHN DONNE.,
9927,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne, altogether, gives us the impression of a great genius ruined by"
9928,JOHN DONNE.,a false system. He is a charioteer run away with by his own pampered
9929,JOHN DONNE.,"steeds. He begins generally well, but long ere the close, quibbles,"
9930,JOHN DONNE.,"conceits, and the temptation of shewing off recondite learning, prove"
9931,JOHN DONNE.,"too strong for him, and he who commenced following a serene star, ends"
9932,JOHN DONNE.,"pursuing a will-o'-wisp into a bottomless morass. Compare, for instance,"
9933,JOHN DONNE.,the ingenious nonsense which abounds in the middle and the close of his
9934,JOHN DONNE.,"'Progress of the Soul' with the dark, but magnificent stanzas which are"
9935,JOHN DONNE.,the first in the poem.
9936,JOHN DONNE.,
9937,JOHN DONNE.,In no writings in the language is there more spilt treasure--a more lavish
9938,JOHN DONNE.,"loss of beautiful, original, and striking things than in the poems of"
9939,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne. Every second line, indeed, is either bad, or unintelligible, or"
9940,JOHN DONNE.,"twisted into unnatural distortion, but even the worst passages discover a"
9941,JOHN DONNE.,"great, though trammelled and tasteless mind; and we question if Dr Johnson"
9942,JOHN DONNE.,"himself, who has, in his 'Life of Cowley,' criticised the school of poets"
9943,JOHN DONNE.,"to which Donne belonged so severely, and in some points so justly,"
9944,JOHN DONNE.,"possessed a tithe of the rich fancy, the sublime intuition, and the lofty"
9945,JOHN DONNE.,spirituality of Donne. How characteristic of the difference between these
9946,JOHN DONNE.,"two great men, that, while the one shrank from the slightest footprint of"
9947,JOHN DONNE.,"death, Donne deliberately placed the image of his dead self before his"
9948,JOHN DONNE.,"eyes, and became familiar with the shadow ere the grim reality arrived!"
9949,JOHN DONNE.,
9950,JOHN DONNE.,"Donne's Satires shew, in addition to the high ideal qualities, the rugged"
9951,JOHN DONNE.,"versification, the fantastic paradox, and the perverted taste of their"
9952,JOHN DONNE.,"author, great strength and clearness of judgment, and a deep, although"
9953,JOHN DONNE.,"somewhat jaundiced, view of human nature. That there must have been"
9954,JOHN DONNE.,something morbid in the structure of his mind is proved by the fact that
9955,JOHN DONNE.,"he wrote an elaborate treatise, which was not published till after his"
9956,JOHN DONNE.,"death, entitled, 'Biathanatos,' to prove that suicide was not necessarily"
9957,JOHN DONNE.,sinful.

11107,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"1  It was the time, when 'gainst the breaking day"
11108,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Rebellious night yet strove, and still repined;"
11109,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"For in the east appear'd the morning gray,"
11110,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And yet some lamps in Jove's high palace shined,"
11111,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"When to Mount Olivet he took his way,"
11112,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And saw, as round about his eyes he twined,"
11113,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Night's shadows hence, from thence the morning's shine;"
11114,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"This bright, that dark; that earthly, this divine:"
11115,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11116,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,2  Thus to himself he thought: 'How many bright

11125,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"3  Thus as he mused, to the top he went,"

11133,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,

11135,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"In golden weed the morning's lusty queen,"

11138,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,Upon his breast and forehead gently blew
11139,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The air, that balm and nardus breathed unseen;"
11140,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And o'er his head, let down from clearest skies,"

11147,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"So cheered are the flowers, late withered,"

11159,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"That forest was, but sweet with pleasant shade."
11160,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11161,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"7  Forward he pass'd, and in the grove before"
11162,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"He heard a sound, that strange, sweet, pleasing was;"
11163,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"There roll'd a crystal brook with gentle roar,"
11164,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"There sigh'd the winds, as through the leaves they pass;"

11170,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"8  A dreadful thunder-clap at last he heard,"

11173,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Birds, winds, and waters, sing with sweet consent;"
11174,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Whereat amazed, he stay'd, and well prepared"
11175,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"For his defence, heedful and slow forth-went;"
11176,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Nor in his way his passage ought withstood,"

11182,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"All the large desert in his bosom held,"

11191,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,On arches great of that rich metal rear'd:
11192,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"When through that golden way he enter'd was,"
11193,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Down fell the bridge; swelled the stream, and wear'd"
11194,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The work away, nor sign left, where it stood,"
11195,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And of a river calm became a flood.
11196,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11197,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"11 He turn'd, amazed to see it troubled so,"
11198,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Like sudden brooks, increased with molten snow;"
11199,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The billows fierce, that tossed to and fro,"
11200,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,The whirlpools suck'd down to their bosoms low;
11201,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"But on he went to search for wonders mo,[1]"
11202,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Through the thick trees, there high and broad which grow;"
11203,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"And in that forest huge, and desert wide,"
11204,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The more he sought, more wonders still he spied:"
11205,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11206,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"12 Where'er he stepp'd, it seem'd the joyful ground"
11207,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,Renew'd the verdure of her flowery weed;
11208,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"A fountain here, a well-spring there he found;"
11209,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Here bud the roses, there the lilies spread:"
11210,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,The aged wood o'er and about him round
11211,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Flourish'd with blossoms new, new leaves, new seed;"
11212,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And on the boughs and branches of those treen
11213,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The bark was soften'd, and renew'd the green."
11214,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11215,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,13 The manna on each leaf did pearled lie;
11216,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,The honey stilled[2] from the tender rind:
11217,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,Again he heard that wonderful harmony
11218,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,Of songs and sweet complaints of lovers kind;
11219,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The human voices sung a treble high,"
11220,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"To which respond the birds, the streams, the wind;"
11221,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"But yet unseen those nymphs, those singers were,"

11223,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,
11224,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"14 He look'd, he listen'd, yet his thoughts denied"
11225,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,To think that true which he did hear and see:
11226,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"A myrtle in an ample plain he spied,"
11227,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And thither by a beaten path went he;
11228,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"The myrtle spread her mighty branches wide,"
11229,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"Higher than pine, or palm, or cypress tree,"
11230,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,And far above all other plants was seen
11231,RINALDO AT MOUNT OLIVET.,"That forest's lady, and that desert's queen."

11386,SIR HENRY WOTTON,"and adroitness. Toward the end of his days, in order to gain the Provost-"

11388,SIR HENRY WOTTON,"72d year of his age. His writings were published in 1651, under the title"
11389,SIR HENRY WOTTON,"of 'Reliquitae Wottonianae,' and Izaak Walton has written an entertaining"
11390,SIR HENRY WOTTON,account of his life. His poetry has a few pleasing and smooth-flowing

11486,RICHARD CORBET.,
11487,RICHARD CORBET.,
11488,RICHARD CORBET.,This witty and good-natured bishop was born in 1582. He was the son of
11489,RICHARD CORBET.,"a gardener, who, however, had the honour to be known to and sung by Ben"
11490,RICHARD CORBET.,Jonson. He was educated at Westminster and Oxford; and having received
11491,RICHARD CORBET.,"orders, was made successively Bishop of Oxford and of Norwich. He was"
11492,RICHARD CORBET.,a most facetious and rather too convivial person; and a collection of
11493,RICHARD CORBET.,"anecdotes about him might be made, little inferior, in point of wit and"
11494,RICHARD CORBET.,"coarseness, to that famous one, once so popular in Scotland, relating to"
11495,RICHARD CORBET.,"the sayings and doings of George Buchanan. He is said, on one occasion,"
11496,RICHARD CORBET.,to have aided an unfortunate ballad-singer in his professional duty by
11497,RICHARD CORBET.,"arraying himself in his leathern jacket and vending the stock, being"
11498,RICHARD CORBET.,"possessed of a fine presence and a clear, full, ringing voice."
11499,RICHARD CORBET.,"Occasionally doffing his clerical costume he adjourned with his chaplain,"
11500,RICHARD CORBET.,"Dr Lushington, to the wine-cellar, where care and ceremony were both"
11501,RICHARD CORBET.,"speedily drowned, the one of the pair exclaiming, 'Here's to thee,"
11502,RICHARD CORBET.,"Lushington,' and the other, 'Here's to thee, Corbet.' Men winked at"
11503,RICHARD CORBET.,"these irregularities, probably on the principle mentioned by Scott, in"
11504,RICHARD CORBET.,"reference to Prior Aymer, in 'Ivanhoe,'--'If Prior Aymer rode hard in"
11505,RICHARD CORBET.,"the chase, or remained late at the banquet, men only shrugged up their"
11506,RICHARD CORBET.,shoulders by recollecting that the same irregularities were practised by
11507,RICHARD CORBET.,"many of his brethren, who had no redeeming qualities whatsoever to atone"
11508,RICHARD CORBET.,"for them.' Corbet, on the other hand, was a kind as well as a convivial"
11509,RICHARD CORBET.,--a warm-hearted as well as an eccentric man. He was tolerant to the
11510,RICHARD CORBET.,Puritans and sectaries; his attention to his duties was respectable; his
11511,RICHARD CORBET.,"talents were of a high order, and he had in him a vein of genius of no"
11512,RICHARD CORBET.,"ordinary kind. He died in 1635, but his poems were not published till"
11513,RICHARD CORBET.,"1647. They are of various merit, and treat of various subjects. In his"
11514,RICHARD CORBET.,"'Journey to France,' you see the humorist, who, on one occasion, when the"
11515,RICHARD CORBET.,"country people were flocking to be confirmed, cried, 'Bear off there, or"
11516,RICHARD CORBET.,"I'll confirm ye with my staff.' In his lines to his son Vincent, we see,"
11517,RICHARD CORBET.,"notwithstanding all his foibles, the good man; and in his 'Farewell to"
11518,RICHARD CORBET.,the Fairies' the fine and fanciful poet.

11752,BEN JONSON.,"in Annandale, having died before his birth. His mother marrying a"
11753,BEN JONSON.,"bricklayer, Ben was brought up to the same employment. Disliking this,"
11754,BEN JONSON.,"he enlisted in the army, and served with credit in the Low Countries."
11755,BEN JONSON.,"When he came home, he entered St John's College, Cambridge; but his stay"

11759,BEN JONSON.,"performer, for which he was committed to prison, but released without"
11760,BEN JONSON.,a trial. He resumed his labours as a writer for the stage; but having
11761,BEN JONSON.,"failed in the acting department, he forsook it for ever. His first hit"
11762,BEN JONSON.,"was, 'Every Man in his Humour,' a play enacted in 1598, Shakspeare being"

11765,BEN JONSON.,"Scottish nation in one of his comedies,--he was appointed in 1619 poet-"
11766,BEN JONSON.,"laureate, with a pension of 100 marks,--he made the same year a journey"

12205,ROBERT BURTON.,
12206,ROBERT BURTON.,"The great, though whimsical author of the 'Anatomy of Melancholy' was"
12207,ROBERT BURTON.,"born at Lindley, in Leicestershire, 1576, and educated at Christ Church,"
12208,ROBERT BURTON.,"Oxford. He became Rector of Seagrave, in his native shire. He was a man"
12209,ROBERT BURTON.,"of vast erudition, of integrity and benevolence, but his happiness,"
12210,ROBERT BURTON.,"like that of Burns, although in a less measure, 'was blasted _ab"
12211,ROBERT BURTON.,origine_ by an incurable taint of hypochondria;' and although at times a
12212,ROBERT BURTON.,"most delightful companion, at other times he was so miserable, even when"
12213,ROBERT BURTON.,"a young student at Oxford, that he had no resource but to go down to the"
12214,ROBERT BURTON.,"river-side, where the coarse jests of the bargemen threw him into fits"
12215,ROBERT BURTON.,"of laughter. This surely was a violent remedy, and one that must have"
12216,ROBERT BURTON.,"reacted into deeper depression. In 1621, he wrote and published, as a"
12217,ROBERT BURTON.,"safety-valve to his morbid feelings, his famous 'Anatomie of Melancholy,"
12218,ROBERT BURTON.,"by Democritus Junior.' It became instantly popular, and sold so well,"
12219,ROBERT BURTON.,that the publisher is said to have made a fortune by it. Nothing more of
12220,ROBERT BURTON.,"consequence is recorded of the author, who died in 1640. Although"
12221,ROBERT BURTON.,
12222,ROBERT BURTON.,"'Melancholy mark'd him for her own,'"
12223,ROBERT BURTON.,
12224,ROBERT BURTON.,she failed to kill him till he had passed his grand climacteric. He was
12225,ROBERT BURTON.,"buried in Christ Church, with the following epitaph, said to have been"
12226,ROBERT BURTON.,composed by himself:--
12227,ROBERT BURTON.,
12228,ROBERT BURTON.,"'Paucis notus, paucioribus ignotus."
12229,ROBERT BURTON.,"Hic jacet Democritus Junior,"
12230,ROBERT BURTON.,Cui vitam pariter et mortem
12231,ROBERT BURTON.,Dedit _Melancholia_!
12232,ROBERT BURTON.,
12233,ROBERT BURTON.,"'Known [by name] to few, unknown [as the author of the ""Anatomy""]"
12234,ROBERT BURTON.,"to fewer, here lies D. J., who owes his death [as a man] and his"
12235,ROBERT BURTON.,life [as an author] to Melancholy.'
12236,ROBERT BURTON.,
12237,ROBERT BURTON.,"His work is certainly a most curious and bewitching medley of thought,"
12238,ROBERT BURTON.,"information, wit, learning, personal interest, and poetic fancy. We all"
12239,ROBERT BURTON.,know it was the only book which ever drew the lazy Johnson from his bed
12240,ROBERT BURTON.,"an hour sooner than he wished to rise. The subject, like the flesh of"
12241,ROBERT BURTON.,"that 'melancholy' creature the hare, may be dry, but, as with that, an"
12242,ROBERT BURTON.,astute cookery prevails to make it exceedingly piquant; the sauce is
12243,ROBERT BURTON.,"better than the substance. Burton's melancholy is not, like Johnson's,"
12244,ROBERT BURTON.,"a deep, hopeless, 'inspissated gloom,' thickened by memories of remorse,"
12245,ROBERT BURTON.,"and lighted up by the lurid fires of feared perdition; it is not, like"
12246,ROBERT BURTON.,"Byron's, dashed with the demoniac element, and fretted into universal"
12247,ROBERT BURTON.,"misanthropy; it is not, like Foster's, the sad, fixed fascination of"
12248,ROBERT BURTON.,"a pure intelligence contemplating the darker side of things, as by a"
12249,ROBERT BURTON.,"necessity of nature, and ignoring, without denying, the existence of the"
12250,ROBERT BURTON.,"bright; nor is it, like that of the 'melancholy Jacques,' in 'As you"
12251,ROBERT BURTON.,"Like it,' a wild, woodland, fantastical habit of thought, as of one"
12252,ROBERT BURTON.,"living collaterally and aside to the world, and which often explodes"
12253,ROBERT BURTON.,into laughter at itself and at all things else;--Burton's is a wide-
12254,ROBERT BURTON.,"spread but tender shade, like twilight, diffused over the whole horizon"
12255,ROBERT BURTON.,"of his thought, and is nourished at times into a luxury, and at times"
12256,ROBERT BURTON.,paraded as a peculiar possession. In his form of melancholy there are
12257,ROBERT BURTON.,"pleasures as well as pains. 'Most pleasant it is,' he says, 'to such"
12258,ROBERT BURTON.,"as are to melancholy given, to lie in bed whole days and keep their"
12259,ROBERT BURTON.,"chambers; to walk alone in some solitary grove, betwixt wood and water,"
12260,ROBERT BURTON.,"by a brook-side, to meditate upon some delightsome and pleasant subject;"
12261,ROBERT BURTON.,and a most incomparable delight it is so to melancholise and build
12262,ROBERT BURTON.,castles in the air.' Religious considerations have little to do with
12263,ROBERT BURTON.,"Burton's melancholy, and remorse or fear apparently nothing. Hence his"
12264,ROBERT BURTON.,"book, although its theme be sadness, never shadows the spirit, but, on"
12265,ROBERT BURTON.,"the contrary, from his dark, Lethean poppies, his readers are made to"
12266,ROBERT BURTON.,"extract an element of joyful excitement, and the anatomy, and the cure,"
12267,ROBERT BURTON.,"of the evil, are one and the same."
12268,ROBERT BURTON.,
12269,ROBERT BURTON.,"As a writer, Burton ranks, in some points, with Montaigne, and in others"
12270,ROBERT BURTON.,"with Sir Thomas Browne. He resembles the first in simplicity, _bonhommie_,"
12271,ROBERT BURTON.,"and miscellaneous learning, and the other in rambling manner, quaint"
12272,ROBERT BURTON.,"phraseology, and fantastic imagination. Neither of the three could be said"
12273,ROBERT BURTON.,"to write books, but they accumulated vast storehouses, whence thousands of"
12274,ROBERT BURTON.,"volumes might be, and have been compiled. There is nothing in Burton so"
12275,ROBERT BURTON.,"low as in many of the 'Essays' of Montaigne, but there is nothing so lofty"
12276,ROBERT BURTON.,as in passages of Browne's 'Religio Medici' and 'Urn-Burial.' Burton has
12277,ROBERT BURTON.,"been a favourite quarry to literary thieves, among whom Sterne, in his"
12278,ROBERT BURTON.,"'Tristram Shandy,' stands pre-eminent. To his 'Anatomy' he prefixes a poem,"
12279,ROBERT BURTON.,a few stanzas of which we extract.

12565,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,
12566,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,
12567,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,This witty baronet was born in 1608. He was the son of the Comptroller
12568,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,of the Household of Charles I. He was uncommonly precocious; at five is
12569,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"said to have spoken Latin, and at sixteen had entered into the service"
12570,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"of Gustavus Adolphus, 'the lion of the North, and the bulwark of the"
12571,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,Protestant faith.'
12572,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,
12573,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"On his return to England, he was favoured by Charles, and became, in his"
12574,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"turn, a most enthusiastic supporter of the Royal cause; writing plays for"
12575,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"the amusement of the Court; and when the Civil War broke out, raising, at"
12576,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"his own expense of £1200, a regiment for the King, which is said to have"
12577,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,been distinguished only by its 'finery and cowardice.' When the Earl of
12578,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"Strafford came into trouble, Suckling, along with some other cavaliers,"
12579,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"intrigued for his deliverance, was impeached by the House of Commons,"
12580,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,and had to flee to France. Here an early death awaited him. His servant
12581,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"having robbed him, he drew on, in vehement haste, his boots, to pursue"
12582,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"the defaulter, when a rusty nail, or, some say, the blade of a knife,"
12583,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"which was concealed in one of them, pierced his heel. A mortification"
12584,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"ensued, and he died, in 1641, at thirty-three years of age."
12585,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,
12586,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"Suckling has written five plays, various poems, besides letters,"
12587,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"speeches, and tracts, which have all been collected into one thin volume."
12588,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"They are of various merit; none, in fact, being worthy of print, or at"
12589,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"least of preservation, except one or two of his songs, and his 'Ballad"
12590,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,upon a Wedding'. This last is an admirable expression of what were his
12591,SIR JOHN SUCKLING.,"principal qualities--_naiveté_, sly humour, gay badinage, and a delicious"

12811,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"Cartwright was born in 1611, and was the son of an innkeeper--once a"
12812,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"gentleman--in Cirencester. He became a King's scholar at Westminster,"
12813,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"and afterwards took orders at Oxford, where he distinguished himself,"
12814,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"according to Wood, as a 'most florid and seraphic preacher.' One is"
12815,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"reminded of the description given of Jeremy Taylor, who, when he first"
12816,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"began to preach, by his 'young and florid beauty, and his sublime and"
12817,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"raised discourses, made men take him for an angel newly descended from"
12818,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"the climes of Paradise.' Cartwright was appointed, through his friend"
12819,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"Bishop Duppa, Succentor of the Church of Salisbury in 1642. He was one"
12820,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"of a council of war appointed by the University of Oxford, for providing"
12821,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"troops in the King's cause, to protect, or some said to overawe, the"
12822,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,Universities. He was imprisoned by the Parliamentary forces on account
12823,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"of his zeal in the Royal cause, but soon liberated on bail. In 1643,"
12824,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"he was appointed Junior Proctor of his University, and also Reader in"
12825,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,Metaphysics. At this time he is said to have studied sixteen hours
12826,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"a-day. This, however, seems to have weakened his constitution, and"
12827,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"rendered him an easy victim to what was called the camp-fever, then"
12828,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"prevalent in Oxford. He died December 23, 1643, aged thirty-two. The"
12829,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"King, then in Oxford, went into mourning for him. His works were"
12830,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"published in 1651, and to them were prefixed fifty copies of encomiastic"
12831,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,verses from the wits and poets of the time. They scarcely justify the
12832,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"praises they have received, being somewhat crude and harsh, and all of"
12833,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"them occasional. His private character, his eloquence as a preacher, and"
12834,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"his zeal as a Royalist, seem to have supplemented his claims as a poet."
12835,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"He enjoyed, too, in his earlier life, the friendship of Ben Jonson, who"
12836,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,"used to say of him, 'My son Cartwright writes all like a man;' and such"
12837,WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.,a sentence from such an authority was at that time fame.

12997,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"a lovely part of a lovely county. He was educated at Oxford, and went"
12998,WILLIAM BROWNE.,thence to the Inner Temple. He was at one time tutor to the Earl of
12999,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"Carnarvon, and afterwards, when that nobleman perished in the battle of"
13000,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"Newbury, in 1643, he was patronised by the Earl of Pembroke, in whose"
13001,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"house he resided, and is even said to have become so rich that he"
13002,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"purchased an estate. In 1645 he died, at Ottery St Mary, the parish"
13003,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"where, in 1772, Coleridge was born."

13005,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"Browne began his poetical career early, and closed it soon. He published"
13006,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"the first part of 'Britannia's Pastorals' in 1613, the second in 1616;"
13007,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"shortly after, his 'Shepherd's Pipe;' and, in 1620, produced his 'Inner"
13008,WILLIAM BROWNE.,"Temple Masque' which was then enacted, but not printed till a hundred"

13285,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,
13286,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,
13287,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"A man of much finer gifts than Stirling, was the famous Drummond. He"
13288,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"was born, December 13, 1585, at Hawthornden, his father's estate, in"
13289,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"Mid- Lothian. It is one of the most beautiful spots, along the sides"
13290,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"of one of the fairest streams in all Scotland, and well fitted to be"
13291,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"the home of genius. He studied civil law for four years in France, but,"
13292,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"in 1611, the estate of Hawthornden became his own, and here he fixed his"
13293,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"residence, and applied himself to literature. At this time he courted,"
13294,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"and was upon the point of marrying, a lady named Cunningham, who died;"
13295,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"and the melancholy which preyed on his mind after this event, drove him"
13296,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"abroad in search of solace. He visited Italy, Germany, and France; and"
13297,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"during his eight years of residence on the Continent, used his time"
13298,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"well, conversing with the learned, admiring all that was admirable in"
13299,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"the scenery and the life of foreign lands, and collecting rare books and"
13300,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"manuscripts. He had, before his departure, published, first, a volume"
13301,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"of occasional poems; next, a moral treatise, in prose, entitled, 'The"
13302,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"Cypress Grove;' and then another work, in verse, 'The Flowers of Zion.'"
13303,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"Returned once more to Scotland, he retired to the seat of his brother-"
13304,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"in-law, Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet, and there wrote a 'History of"
13305,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"the Five James's of Scotland,' a book abounding in bombast and slavish"
13306,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"principles. When he returned to his own lovely Hawthornden, he met a"
13307,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"lady named Logan, of the house of Restalrig, whom he fancied to bear a"
13308,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"striking resemblance to his dead mistress. On that hint he spake, and"
13309,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"she became his wife. He proceeded to repair the house of Hawthornden,"
13310,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"and would have spent his days there in great peace, had it not been for"
13311,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,the distracted times. His politics were of the Royalist complexion; and
13312,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"the party in power, belonging to the Presbyterians, used every method to"
13313,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"annoy him, compelling him, for instance, to furnish his quota of men and"
13314,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"arms to support the cause which he opposed. In 1619, Ben Jonson visited"
13315,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,him at Hawthornden. The pair were not well assorted. Brawny Ben and
13316,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"dreaming Drummond seem, in the expressive coinage of De Quincey, to have"
13317,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"'interdespised;' and is not their feud, with all its circumstances,"
13318,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,recorded in the chronicles of the 'Quarrels of Authors' compiled by the
13319,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,elder Disraeli? The death of a lady sent Drummond travelling over Europe
13320,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,--the death of a King sent him away on a farther and a final journey.
13321,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,His grief for the execution of Charles I. is said to have shortened his
13322,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"days. At all events, in December of the year of the so-called"
13323,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"'Martyrdom,' (1649,) he breathed his last."
13324,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,
13325,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,He was a genuine poet as well as a brilliant humorist. His 'Polemo
13326,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"Middinia,' a grotesque mixture of bad Latin and semi-Latinised Scotch,"
13327,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"has created, among many generations, inextinguishable laughter. His"
13328,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"'Wandering Muses; or, The River of Forth Feasting,' has some gorgeous"
13329,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"descriptions, particularly of Scotland's lakes and rivers, at a time"
13330,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,when

13333,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,Ayont New Holland;'
13334,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,
13335,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,but his sonnets are unquestionably his finest productions. They breathe
13336,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,a spirit of genuine poetry. Each one of them is a rose lightly wet
13337,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"with the dew of tenderness, and one or two suggest irresistibly the"
13338,WILLIAM DRUMMOND.,"recollection of our Great Dramatist's sonnets, although we feel that"
