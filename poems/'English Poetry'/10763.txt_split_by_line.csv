25,FOREWORD,
26,FOREWORD,This is a volume of inspirational poems. Its purpose is to bring men
27,FOREWORD,"courage and resolution, to cheer them, to fire them with new confidence"
28,FOREWORD,"when they grow dispirited, to strengthen their faith that THINGS CAN BE"
29,FOREWORD,DONE. It is better for this purpose than the entire works of any one
30,FOREWORD,"poet, for it takes the cream of many and has greater diversity than any"
31,FOREWORD,one writer can show.
32,FOREWORD,
33,FOREWORD,It is made up chiefly of very recent poems--not such as were written for
34,FOREWORD,"anthologies of poetical ""gems,"" but such as speak directly to the heart,"
35,FOREWORD,"always in very simple language, often in the phrases of shop or office"
36,FOREWORD,"or street. Included, however, with the poems of the day are a few of the"
37,FOREWORD,fine old pieces that have been of comfort to men through the ages.
38,FOREWORD,
39,FOREWORD,"Besides the poems themselves, the volume contains helps to their"
40,FOREWORD,understanding and enjoyment. The pieces are introduced by short
41,FOREWORD,comments; these serve the same purpose as the strain played by the
42,FOREWORD,"pianist before the singer begins to sing; they create a mood, give a"
43,FOREWORD,"point of view, throw light on the meaning of what follows. Also the"
44,FOREWORD,lives of the authors are briefly summarized; this is in answer to our
45,FOREWORD,"natural interest in the writer of a poem we like, and in the case of"
46,FOREWORD,living poets it brings together facts hardly to be found anywhere else.
47,FOREWORD,
48,FOREWORD,"Finally, the book is not one to be read and then cast aside. It is to be"
49,FOREWORD,kept as a constant companion and an unfailing recourse in weariness or
50,FOREWORD,"gloom. Human companions are not always in the mood to cheer us, and may"
51,FOREWORD,"talk upon themes we dislike. But this book will converse or be silent,"
52,FOREWORD,"it is never out of sorts or discouraged, and so far from being wed to"
53,FOREWORD,"some single topic, it will speak to us at any time on any subject we"
54,FOREWORD,desire.
55,FOREWORD,
56,FOREWORD,To many authors and publishers acknowledgment is due for generous
57,FOREWORD,permission to use copyright material.

342,BE THE BEST OF WHATEVER YOU ARE,or doing conspicuous work; it is being the best that is in you. Rattling
343,BE THE BEST OF WHATEVER YOU ARE,around in too big a job is much worse than filling a small one to

378,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,
379,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,
380,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,This poem has as its keynote friendship and sympathy for other people.
381,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,It is a paradox of life that by hoarding love and happiness we lose
382,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"them, and that only by giving them away can we keep them for ourselves."
383,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"The more we share, the more we possess. We of course find in other"
384,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"people weaknesses and sins, but our best means of curing these are"
385,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,through a wise and sympathetic understanding.
386,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,
387,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,
388,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"Let me live in a house by the side of the road,"
389,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,Where the race of men go by--
390,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"The men who are good and the men who are bad,"
391,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,As good and as bad as I.
392,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"I would not sit in the scorner's seat,"
393,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,Or hurl the cynic's ban;--
394,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,Let me live in a house by the side of the road
395,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,And be a friend to man.
396,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,
397,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"I see from my house by the side of the road,"
398,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"By the side of the highway of life,"
399,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"The men who press with the ardor of hope,"
400,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,The men who are faint with the strife.
401,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears--
402,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,Both parts of an infinite plan;--
403,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,Let me live in my house by the side of the road
404,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,And be a friend to man.
405,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,
406,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead
407,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,And mountains of wearisome height;
408,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,And the road passes on through the long afternoon
409,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,And stretches away to the night.
410,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,"
411,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"And weep with the strangers that moan,"
412,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,Nor live in my house by the side of the road
413,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,Like a man who dwells alone.
414,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,
415,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,Let me live in my house by the side of the road
416,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,Where the race of men go by--
417,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"They are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong,"
418,THE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,"Wise, foolish--so am I."

436,FOUR THINGS,various answers to this question. Here the poet states what qualities he

440,FOUR THINGS,Four things a man must learn to do
441,FOUR THINGS,If he would make his record true:

458,IF,The central idea of this poem is that success comes from self-control
459,IF,and a true sense of the values of things. In extremes lies danger. A man
460,IF,"must not lose heart because of doubts or opposition, yet he must do his"
461,IF,best to see the grounds for both. He must not be deceived into thinking
462,IF,either triumph or disaster final; he must use each wisely--and push on.
463,IF,"In all things he must hold to the golden mean. If he does, he will own"
464,IF,"the world, and even better, for his personal reward he will attain the"

472,IF,"If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,"
473,IF,"Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,"
474,IF,"Or being hated don't give way to hating,"

481,IF,If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
482,IF,"Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,"

549,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"After a thing has been done, everybody is ready to declare it easy. But"
550,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"before it has been done, it is called impossible. One reason why people"
551,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,fear to embark upon great enterprises is that they see all the
552,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"difficulties at once. They know they could succeed in the initial tasks,"
553,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"but they shrink from what is to follow. Yet ""a thing begun is half"
554,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"done."" Moreover the surmounting of the first barrier gives strength and"
555,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,ingenuity for the harder ones beyond. Mountains viewed from a distance
556,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"seem to be unscalable. But they can be climbed, and the way to begin is"
557,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,to take the first upward step. From that moment the mountains are less
558,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"high. As Hannibal led his army across the foothills, then among the"
559,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"upper ranges, and finally over the loftiest peaks and passes of the"
560,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"Alps, or as Peary pushed farther and farther into the solitudes that"
561,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"encompass the North Pole, so can you achieve any purpose whatsoever if"
562,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"you heed not the doubters, meet each problem as it arises, and keep ever"
563,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,with you the assurance _It Can Be Done_.

566,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"Somebody said that it couldn't be done,"
567,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,But he with a chuckle replied

569,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.
570,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin
571,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,On his face. If he worried he hid it.
572,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,He started to sing as he tackled the thing
573,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"That couldn't be done, and he did it."
574,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,
575,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"Somebody scoffed: ""Oh, you'll never do that;"
576,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"At least no one ever has done it"";"
577,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,"

581,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,He started to sing as he tackled the thing
582,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"That couldn't be done, and he did it."
583,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,
584,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,"
585,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,There are thousands to prophesy failure;
586,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"There are thousands to point out to you one by one,"
587,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,The dangers that wait to assail you.
588,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,"But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,"
589,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,Just take off your coat and go to it;
590,IT COULDN'T BE DONE,Just start to sing as you tackle the thing

1697,PIPPA'S SONG,"working its way toward perfection, and in the great scheme of things it"

2471,POLONIUS'S ADVICE TO LAERTES,"quarrels if you can, but if they are forced on you, give a good account"
2472,POLONIUS'S ADVICE TO LAERTES,"of yourself. Hear every man's censure (opinion), but express your own"

2811,OPPORTUNITY,"Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,"

2880,ULYSSES,
2881,ULYSSES,
2882,ULYSSES,This volume consists chiefly of contemporary or very recent verse. But
2883,ULYSSES,"it could not serve its full purpose without the presence, here and"
2884,ULYSSES,"there, of older poems--of ""classics."" These express a truth, a mood, or"
2885,ULYSSES,"a spirit that is universal, and they express it in words of noble"
2886,ULYSSES,dignity and beauty. They are not always easy to understand; they are
2887,ULYSSES,"crops we must patiently cultivate, not crops that volunteer. But they"
2888,ULYSSES,"wear well; they grow upon us; we come back to them again and again, and"
2889,ULYSSES,"still they are fresh, living, significant--not empty, meaningless, and"
2890,ULYSSES,"weather-worn, like a last year's crow's nest."
2891,ULYSSES,
2892,ULYSSES,Such a poem is _Ulysses_. It is shot through and through with the spirit
2893,ULYSSES,of strenuous and never-ceasing endeavor--a spirit manifest in a hero who
2894,ULYSSES,has every temptation to rest and enjoy. Ulysses is old. After ten long
2895,ULYSSES,"years of warfare before Troy, after endless misfortunes on his homeward"
2896,ULYSSES,"voyage, after travels and experiences that have taken him everywhere and"
2897,ULYSSES,"shown him everything that men know and do, he has returned to his rude"
2898,ULYSSES,native kingdom. He is reunited with his wife Penelope and his son
2899,ULYSSES,Telemachus. He is rich and famous. Yet he is unsatisfied. The task and
2900,ULYSSES,"routine of governing a slow, materially minded people, though suited to"
2901,ULYSSES,"his son's temperament, are unsuited to his. He wants to wear out rather"
2902,ULYSSES,than to rust out. He wants to discover what the world still holds. He
2903,ULYSSES,"wants to drink life to the lees. The morning has passed, the long day"
2904,ULYSSES,"has waned, twilight and the darkness are at hand. But scant as are the"
2905,ULYSSES,"years left to him, he will use them in a last, incomparable quest. He"
2906,ULYSSES,rallies his old comrades--tried men who always
2907,ULYSSES,
2908,ULYSSES,"""With a frolic welcome took"
2909,ULYSSES,"The thunder and the sunshine""--"
2910,ULYSSES,
2911,ULYSSES,and asks them to brave with him once more the hazards and the hardships
2912,ULYSSES,of the life of vast; unsubdued enterprise.
2913,ULYSSES,
2914,ULYSSES,
2915,ULYSSES,"It little profits that an idle king,"
2916,ULYSSES,"By this still hearth, among these barren crags,"
2917,ULYSSES,"Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole"
2918,ULYSSES,"Unequal laws unto a savage race,"
2919,ULYSSES,"That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me."
2920,ULYSSES,I cannot rest from travel; I will drink
2921,ULYSSES,Life to the lees. All times I have enjoy'd
2922,ULYSSES,"Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those"
2923,ULYSSES,"That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when"
2924,ULYSSES,Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades
2925,ULYSSES,Vext the dim sea. I am become a name;
2926,ULYSSES,For always roaming with a hungry heart
2927,ULYSSES,"Much have I seen and known,--cities of men"
2928,ULYSSES,"And manners, climates, councils, governments,"
2929,ULYSSES,"Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,--"
2930,ULYSSES,"And drunk delight of battle with my peers,"
2931,ULYSSES,Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.
2932,ULYSSES,I am a part of all that I have met;
2933,ULYSSES,Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'
2934,ULYSSES,Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades
2935,ULYSSES,For ever and for ever when I move.
2936,ULYSSES,"How dull it is to pause, to make an end,"
2937,ULYSSES,"To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!"
2938,ULYSSES,As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life
2939,ULYSSES,"Were all too little, and of one to me"
2940,ULYSSES,Little remains; but every hour is saved
2941,ULYSSES,"From that eternal silence, something more,"
2942,ULYSSES,A bringer of new things; and vile it were
2943,ULYSSES,"For some three suns to store and hoard myself,"
2944,ULYSSES,And this gray spirit yearning in desire
2945,ULYSSES,"To follow knowledge like a sinking star,"
2946,ULYSSES,Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
2947,ULYSSES,"This is my son, mine own Telemachus,"
2948,ULYSSES,"To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,--"
2949,ULYSSES,"Well-beloved of me, discerning to fulfil"
2950,ULYSSES,"This labor, by slow prudence to make mild"
2951,ULYSSES,"A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees"
2952,ULYSSES,Subdue them to the useful and the good.
2953,ULYSSES,"Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere"
2954,ULYSSES,"Of common duties, decent not to fail"
2955,ULYSSES,"In offices of tenderness, and pay"
2956,ULYSSES,"Meet adoration to my household gods,"
2957,ULYSSES,"When I am gone. He works his work, I mine."
2958,ULYSSES,There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;
2959,ULYSSES,"There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,"
2960,ULYSSES,"Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,--"
2961,ULYSSES,That ever with a frolic welcome took
2962,ULYSSES,"The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed"
2963,ULYSSES,"Free hearts, free foreheads,--you and I are old;"
2964,ULYSSES,Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.
2965,ULYSSES,"Death closes all; but something ere the end,"
2966,ULYSSES,"Some work of noble note, may yet be done,"
2967,ULYSSES,Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.
2968,ULYSSES,The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;
2969,ULYSSES,The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
2970,ULYSSES,"Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends."
2971,ULYSSES,'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
2972,ULYSSES,"Push off, and sitting well in order smite"
2973,ULYSSES,The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
2974,ULYSSES,"To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths"
2975,ULYSSES,"Of all the western stars, until I die."
2976,ULYSSES,It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
2977,ULYSSES,"It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,"
2978,ULYSSES,"And see the great Achilles, whom we knew."
2979,ULYSSES,"Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'"
2980,ULYSSES,We are not now that strength which in old days
2981,ULYSSES,"Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,--"
2982,ULYSSES,"One equal temper of heroic hearts,"
2983,ULYSSES,"Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will"
2984,ULYSSES,"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield."

4401,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,In the great Civil War in England between the Puritans and Charles the
4402,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,First the author of this poem sacrificed everything in the royal cause.
4403,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,That cause was defeated and Lovelace was imprisoned. In these stanzas he
4404,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,makes the most of his gloomy situation and sings the joys of various
4405,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,"kinds of freedom. First is the freedom brought by love, when his"
4406,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,sweetheart speaks to him through the grate of the dungeon. Second is the
4407,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,"freedom brought by the recollection of good fellowship, when tried and"
4408,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,"true comrades took their wine straight--""with no allaying Thames."" Third"
4409,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,is the freedom brought by remembrance of the king for whom he was
4410,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,suffering. Finally comes the passionate and heroic assertion that though
4411,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,"the body of a man may be confined, nevertheless his spirit can remain"
4412,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,free and chainless.

4427,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,Our hearts with loyal flames;

4445,TO ALTHEA FROM PRISON,That for an hermitage;

5229,SWELLITIS,A certain employer of large numbers of men makes it a principle to
5230,SWELLITIS,"praise none of them, not because they are undeserving, and not because"
5231,SWELLITIS,"he dislikes to commend, but because experience has taught him that"
5232,SWELLITIS,"usually the praise goes to the head of the recipient, both impairing his"
5233,SWELLITIS,work and making it harder for others to associate with him. A good test
5234,SWELLITIS,"of a man is his way of taking commendation. He may, even while grateful,"
5235,SWELLITIS,"be stirred to humility that he has not done better still, and may"
5236,SWELLITIS,resolve to accomplish more. Or imitating the frog who wished to look
5237,SWELLITIS,"like an ox, he may swell and swell until--figuratively speaking--he"
5238,SWELLITIS,bursts.
5239,SWELLITIS,
5240,SWELLITIS,
5241,SWELLITIS,"Somebody said he'd done it well,"
5242,SWELLITIS,And presto! his head began to swell;
5243,SWELLITIS,Bigger and bigger the poor thing grew--
5244,SWELLITIS,A wonder it didn't split in two.
5245,SWELLITIS,In size a balloon could scarcely match it;
5246,SWELLITIS,He needed a fishing-pole to scratch it;---
5247,SWELLITIS,"But six and a half was the size of his hat,"
5248,SWELLITIS,And it rattled around on his head at that!
5249,SWELLITIS,
5250,SWELLITIS,"""Good work,"" somebody chanced to say,"
5251,SWELLITIS,And his chest swelled big as a load of hay.
5252,SWELLITIS,"About himself, like a rooster, he crowed;"
5253,SWELLITIS,Of his wonderful work he bragged and blowed
5254,SWELLITIS,He marched around with a peacock strut;
5255,SWELLITIS,Gigantic to him was the figure he cut;--
5256,SWELLITIS,"But he wore a very small-sized suit,"
5257,SWELLITIS,"And loosely it hung on him, to boot!"
5258,SWELLITIS,
5259,SWELLITIS,HE was the chap who made things hum!
5260,SWELLITIS,HE was the drumstick and the drum!
5261,SWELLITIS,HE was the shirt bosom and the starch!
5262,SWELLITIS,HE was the keystone in the arch!
5263,SWELLITIS,HE was the axis of the earth!
5264,SWELLITIS,Nothing existed before his birth!
5265,SWELLITIS,But when he was off from work a
5266,SWELLITIS,Nobody knew that he was away!
5267,SWELLITIS,
5268,SWELLITIS,This is a fact that is sad to tell:
5269,SWELLITIS,It's the empty head that is bound to swell;
5270,SWELLITIS,It's the light-weight fellow who soars to the skies
5271,SWELLITIS,And bursts like a bubble before your eyes.
5272,SWELLITIS,"A big man is humbled by honest praise,"
5273,SWELLITIS,And tries to think of all the ways
5274,SWELLITIS,To improve his work and do it well;--
5275,SWELLITIS,But a little man starts of himself to yell!

5861,BORROWED FEATHERS,"Many good, attractive people spoil the merits they have by trying to be"

5865,BORROWED FEATHERS,A rooster one morning was preening his feathers
5866,BORROWED FEATHERS,That glistened so bright in the sun;
5867,BORROWED FEATHERS,He admired the tints of the various colors
5868,BORROWED FEATHERS,As he laid them in place one by one.
5869,BORROWED FEATHERS,"Now as roosters go he was a fine bird,"
5870,BORROWED FEATHERS,And he should have been satisfied;
5871,BORROWED FEATHERS,"But suddenly there as he marched along,"
5872,BORROWED FEATHERS,Some peacock feathers he spied.
5873,BORROWED FEATHERS,They had beautiful spots and their colors were gay--
5874,BORROWED FEATHERS,He wished that his own could be green;
5875,BORROWED FEATHERS,"He dropped his tail, tried to hide it away;"
5876,BORROWED FEATHERS,Was completely ashamed to be seen.
5877,BORROWED FEATHERS,
5878,BORROWED FEATHERS,Then his foolish mind hatched up a scheme--
5879,BORROWED FEATHERS,A peacock yet he could be;
5880,BORROWED FEATHERS,So he hopped behind a bush to undress
5881,BORROWED FEATHERS,Where the other fowls could not see.
5882,BORROWED FEATHERS,"He caught his own tail between his bill,"
5883,BORROWED FEATHERS,And pulled every feather out;
5884,BORROWED FEATHERS,And into the holes stuck the peacock plumes;
5885,BORROWED FEATHERS,Then proudly strutted about.
5886,BORROWED FEATHERS,The other fowls rushed to see the queer sight;
5887,BORROWED FEATHERS,And the peacocks came when they heard;
5888,BORROWED FEATHERS,"They could not agree just what he was,"
5889,BORROWED FEATHERS,But pronounced him a funny bird.
5890,BORROWED FEATHERS,
5891,BORROWED FEATHERS,Then the chickens were angry that one of their kind
5892,BORROWED FEATHERS,Should try to be a peacock;
5893,BORROWED FEATHERS,And the peacocks were mad that one with their tail
5894,BORROWED FEATHERS,Should belong to a common fowl flock.
5895,BORROWED FEATHERS,"So the chickens beset him most cruelly behind,"
5896,BORROWED FEATHERS,And yanked his whole tail out together;
5897,BORROWED FEATHERS,"The peacocks attacked him madly before,"
5898,BORROWED FEATHERS,And pulled out each chicken feather.
5899,BORROWED FEATHERS,"And when he stood stripped clean down to the skin,"
5900,BORROWED FEATHERS,"A horrible thing to the rest,"
5901,BORROWED FEATHERS,He learned this sad lesson when it was too late--
5902,BORROWED FEATHERS,As his own simple self he was best.

6044,COLUMBUS,This poem pictures courage and high resolution. To the terrors of an
6045,COLUMBUS,unknown sea and the mutinous dismay of the sailors Columbus has but two
6046,COLUMBUS,"things to oppose--his faith and his unflinching will. But these suffice,"
6047,COLUMBUS,as they always do. In the last four lines of the poem is a lesson for
6048,COLUMBUS,our nation to-day. The seas upon which our ideals have launched us are
6049,COLUMBUS,perilous and uncharted. In some ways our whole voyage of democracy seems
6050,COLUMBUS,"futile. Shall we turn back, or shall we, like Columbus, answer the"
6051,COLUMBUS,"falterers in words that leap like a leaping sword; ""Sail on, sail on""?"
6052,COLUMBUS,
6053,COLUMBUS,
6054,COLUMBUS,"Behind him lay the gray Azores,"
6055,COLUMBUS,Behind the Gates of Hercules;
6056,COLUMBUS,Before him not the ghost of shores:
6057,COLUMBUS,Before him only shoreless seas.
6058,COLUMBUS,"The good mate said: ""Now must we pray,"
6059,COLUMBUS,For lo! the very stars are gone.
6060,COLUMBUS,"Brave Adm'r'l, speak; what shall I say?"""
6061,COLUMBUS,"""Why, say: 'Sail on! sail on! and on!'"""
6062,COLUMBUS,
6063,COLUMBUS,"""My men grow mutinous day by day;"
6064,COLUMBUS,"My men grow ghastly wan and weak."""
6065,COLUMBUS,The stout mate thought of home; a spray
6066,COLUMBUS,Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek.
6067,COLUMBUS,"""What shall I say, brave Adm'r'l, say,"
6068,COLUMBUS,"If we sight naught but seas at dawn?"""
6069,COLUMBUS,"""Why, you shall say at break of day:"
6070,COLUMBUS,"'Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!'"""
6071,COLUMBUS,
6072,COLUMBUS,"They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow;"
6073,COLUMBUS,Until at last the blanched mate said:
6074,COLUMBUS,"""Why, now not even God would know"
6075,COLUMBUS,Should I and all my men fall dead.
6076,COLUMBUS,"These very winds forget their way,"
6077,COLUMBUS,For God from these dread seas is gone.
6078,COLUMBUS,"Now speak, brave Adm'r'l; speak and say--"""
6079,COLUMBUS,"He said: ""Sail on! sail on! and on!"""
6080,COLUMBUS,
6081,COLUMBUS,They sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate:
6082,COLUMBUS,"""This mad sea shows his teeth to-night."
6083,COLUMBUS,"He curls his lip, he lies in wait,"
6084,COLUMBUS,"With lifted teeth, as if to bite!"
6085,COLUMBUS,"Brave Adm'r'l, say but one good word:"
6086,COLUMBUS,"What shall we do when hope is gone?"""
6087,COLUMBUS,The words leapt like a leaping sword:
6088,COLUMBUS,"""Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!"""
6089,COLUMBUS,
6090,COLUMBUS,"Then, pale and worn, he kept his deck,"
6091,COLUMBUS,"And peered through darkness. Ah, that night"
6092,COLUMBUS,Of all dark nights! And then a speck--
6093,COLUMBUS,"It grew, a starlit flag unfurled!"
6094,COLUMBUS,It grew to be Time's burst of dawn.
6095,COLUMBUS,He gained a world; he gave that world
6096,COLUMBUS,"Its grandest lesson: ""On! sail on!"""

8855,ODE TO DUTY,stanza 3 he looks forward to a time when all people will be thus

8857,ODE TO DUTY,"touch completely with stern, commanding duty. In stanzas 4 and 5 he"
8858,ODE TO DUTY,"states that he himself has been too impatient of control, has wearied"
8859,ODE TO DUTY,"himself by changing from one desire to another, and now wishes to"
8860,ODE TO DUTY,regulate his life by some great abiding principle. In stanza 6 he
8861,ODE TO DUTY,"declares that duty, though stern, is benignant; the flowers bloom in"

9827,THE GIFTS OF GOD,or rest? Many are the answers that have been made to this question. The
9828,THE GIFTS OF GOD,answer here given by the poet is that so richly is man endowed with
9829,THE GIFTS OF GOD,"qualities and attributes that if contentment were added to them, he"
9830,THE GIFTS OF GOD,"would be satisfied with what he has, and would not strive for that which"

10666,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,What is it that a human being wants? Most of us have something that we
10667,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,like to do more than anything else. We are not free to do it as we wish.
10668,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,"We are handicapped by the need to earn a living, by physical weariness,"
10669,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,"by the carpings and scoffs of the envious, by the limited time we have"
10670,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,at our disposal. But underneath all this is _the spirit of work_--the
10671,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,"desire to take up our task for its own sake alone, to give our whole"
10672,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,"selves to it, to carry it through, not in some partial way, but in"
10673,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,accordance with the fulness of our dream. We want to be free from
10674,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,"distractions and interruptions; if we are driven at all, we want it to"
10675,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,"be by our own inner promptings, not by obligation or necessity. Of"

10686,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,
10687,WHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED,And those that were good will be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair;
