41,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
42,INTRODUCTION,
43,INTRODUCTION,
44,INTRODUCTION,"PARTIAL collections of English poems, decided by a common subject or"
45,INTRODUCTION,"bounded by narrow dates and periods of literary history, are made at very"
46,INTRODUCTION,"short intervals, and the makers are safe from the reproach of proposing"
47,INTRODUCTION,their own personal taste as a guide for the reading of others.  But a
48,INTRODUCTION,general Anthology gathered from the whole of English literature—the whole
49,INTRODUCTION,from Chaucer to Wordsworth—by a gatherer intent upon nothing except the
50,INTRODUCTION,"quality of poetry, is a more rare enterprise.  It is hardly to be made"
51,INTRODUCTION,"without tempting the suspicion—nay, hardly without seeming to hazard the"
52,INTRODUCTION,confession—of some measure of self-confidence.  Nor can even the desire
53,INTRODUCTION,to enter upon that labour be a frequent one—the desire of the heart of
54,INTRODUCTION,one for whom poetry is veritably ‘the complementary life’ to set up a
55,INTRODUCTION,"pale for inclusion and exclusion, to add honours, to multiply homage, to"
56,INTRODUCTION,"cherish, to restore, to protest, to proclaim, to depose; and to gain the"
57,INTRODUCTION,"consent of a multitude of readers to all those acts.  Many years,"
58,INTRODUCTION,then—some part of a century—may easily pass between the publication of
59,INTRODUCTION,one general anthology and the making of another.
60,INTRODUCTION,
61,INTRODUCTION,"The enterprise would be a sorry one if it were really arbitrary, and if"
62,INTRODUCTION,an anthologist should give effect to passionate preferences without
63,INTRODUCTION,authority.  An anthology that shall have any value must be made on the
64,INTRODUCTION,responsibility of one but on the authority of many.  There is no caprice;
65,INTRODUCTION,the mind of the maker has been formed for decision by the wisdom of many
66,INTRODUCTION,"instructors.  It is the very study of criticism, and the grateful and"
67,INTRODUCTION,"profitable study, that gives the justification to work done upon the"
68,INTRODUCTION,"strongest personal impulse, and done, finally, in the mental solitude"
69,INTRODUCTION,"that cannot be escaped at the last.  In another order, moral education"
70,INTRODUCTION,would be best crowned if it proved to have quick and profound control
71,INTRODUCTION,over the first impulses; its finished work would be to set the soul in a
72,INTRODUCTION,"state of law, delivered from the delays of self-distrust; not action"
73,INTRODUCTION,"only, but the desires would be in an old security, and a wish would come"
74,INTRODUCTION,to light already justified.  This would be the second—if it were not the
75,INTRODUCTION,only—liberty.  Even so an intellectual education might assuredly confer
76,INTRODUCTION,"freedom upon first and solitary thoughts, and confidence and composure"
77,INTRODUCTION,"upon the sallies of impetuous courage.  In a word, it should make a"
78,INTRODUCTION,"studious anthologist quite sure about genius.  And all who have bestowed,"
79,INTRODUCTION,"or helped in bestowing, the liberating education have given their student"
80,INTRODUCTION,the authority to be free.  Personal and singular the choice in such a
81,INTRODUCTION,"book must be, not without right."
82,INTRODUCTION,
83,INTRODUCTION,"Claiming and disclaiming so much, the gatherers may follow one another to"
84,INTRODUCTION,"harvest, and glean in the same fields in different seasons, for the"
85,INTRODUCTION,repetition of the work can never be altogether a repetition.  The general
86,INTRODUCTION,"consent of criticism does not stand still; and moreover, a mere accident"
87,INTRODUCTION,has until now left a poet of genius of the past here and there to neglect
88,INTRODUCTION,or obscurity.  This is not very likely to befall again; the time has come
89,INTRODUCTION,when there is little or nothing left to discover or rediscover in the
90,INTRODUCTION,sixteenth century or the seventeenth; we know that there does not lurk
91,INTRODUCTION,"another Crashaw contemned, or another Henry Vaughan disregarded, or"
92,INTRODUCTION,another George Herbert misplaced.  There is now something like finality
93,INTRODUCTION,of knowledge at least; and therefore not a little error in the past is
94,INTRODUCTION,ready to be repaired.  This is the result of time.  Of the slow actions
95,INTRODUCTION,"and reactions of critical taste there might be something to say, but"
96,INTRODUCTION,nothing important.  No loyal anthologist perhaps will consent to
97,INTRODUCTION,acknowledge these tides; he will hardly do his work well unless he
98,INTRODUCTION,"believe it to be stable and perfect; nor, by the way, will he judge"
99,INTRODUCTION,worthily in the name of others unless he be resolved to judge intrepidly
100,INTRODUCTION,for himself.
101,INTRODUCTION,
102,INTRODUCTION,Inasmuch as even the best of all poems are the best upon innumerable
103,INTRODUCTION,"degrees, the size of most anthologies has gone far to decide what degrees"
104,INTRODUCTION,are to be gathered in and what left without.  The best might make a very
105,INTRODUCTION,"small volume, and be indeed the best, or a very large volume, and be"
106,INTRODUCTION,still indeed the best.  But my labour has been to do somewhat
107,INTRODUCTION,differently—to gather nothing that did not overpass a certain
108,INTRODUCTION,"boundary-line of genius.  Gray’s _Elegy_, for instance, would rightly be"
109,INTRODUCTION,"placed at the head of everything below that mark.  It is, in fact, so"
110,INTRODUCTION,"near to the work of genius as to be most directly, closely, and"
111,INTRODUCTION,immediately rebuked by genius; it meets genius at close quarters and
112,INTRODUCTION,almost deserves that Shakespeare himself should defeat it.  Mediocrity
113,INTRODUCTION,said its own true word in the _Elegy_:
114,INTRODUCTION,
115,INTRODUCTION,"‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,"
116,INTRODUCTION,And waste its sweetness on the desert air.’
117,INTRODUCTION,
118,INTRODUCTION,But greatness had said its own word also in a sonnet:
119,INTRODUCTION,
120,INTRODUCTION,‘The summer flower is to the summer sweet
121,INTRODUCTION,Though to itself it only live and die.’
122,INTRODUCTION,
123,INTRODUCTION,"The reproof here is too sure; not always does it touch so quick, but it"
124,INTRODUCTION,"is not seldom manifest, and it makes exclusion a simple task.  Inclusion,"
125,INTRODUCTION,"on the other hand, cannot be so completely fulfilled.  The impossibility"
126,INTRODUCTION,"of taking in poems of great length, however purely lyrical, is a"
127,INTRODUCTION,"mechanical barrier, even on the plan of the present volume; in the case"
128,INTRODUCTION,"of Spenser’s _Prothalamion_, the unmanageably autobiographical and local"
129,INTRODUCTION,passage makes it inappropriate; some exquisite things of Landor’s are
130,INTRODUCTION,"lyrics in blank verse, and the necessary rule against blank verse shuts"
131,INTRODUCTION,"them out.  No extracts have been made from any poem, but in a very few"
132,INTRODUCTION,instances a stanza or a passage has been dropped out.  No poem has been
133,INTRODUCTION,put in for the sake of a single perfectly fine passage; it would be too
134,INTRODUCTION,much to say that no poem has been put in for the sake of two splendid
135,INTRODUCTION,passages or so.  The Scottish ballad poetry is represented by examples
136,INTRODUCTION,"that are to my mind finer than anything left out; still, it is but"
137,INTRODUCTION,represented; and as the song of this multitude of unknown poets overflows
138,INTRODUCTION,"by its quantity a collection of lyrics of genius, so does severally the"
139,INTRODUCTION,"song of Wordsworth, Crashaw, and Shelley.  It has been necessary, in"
140,INTRODUCTION,"considering traditional songs of evidently mingled authorship, to reject"
141,INTRODUCTION,some one invaluable stanza or burden—the original and ancient surviving
142,INTRODUCTION,matter of a spoilt song—because it was necessary to reject the sequel
143,INTRODUCTION,that has cumbered it since some sentimentalist took it for his own.  An
144,INTRODUCTION,"example, which makes the heart ache, is that burden of keen and remote"
145,INTRODUCTION,poetry:
146,INTRODUCTION,
147,INTRODUCTION,"‘O the broom, the bonnie, bonnie broom,"
148,INTRODUCTION,The broom of Cowdenknowes!’
149,INTRODUCTION,
150,INTRODUCTION,Perhaps some hand will gather all such precious fragments as these
151,INTRODUCTION,"together one day, freed from what is alien in the work of the restorer."
152,INTRODUCTION,It is inexplicable that a generation resolved to forbid the restoration
153,INTRODUCTION,of ancient buildings should approve the eighteenth century restoration of
154,INTRODUCTION,"ancient poems; nay, the architectural ‘restorer’ is immeasurably the more"
155,INTRODUCTION,"respectful.  In order to give us again the ancient fragments, it is"
156,INTRODUCTION,"happily not necessary to break up the composite songs which, since the"
157,INTRODUCTION,"time of Burns, have gained a national love.  Let them be, but let the old"
158,INTRODUCTION,"verses be also; and let them have, for those who desire it, the"
159,INTRODUCTION,solitariness of their state of ruin.  Even in the cases—and they are not
160,INTRODUCTION,few—where Burns is proved to have given beauty and music to the ancient
161,INTRODUCTION,"fragment itself, his work upon the old stanza is immeasurably finer than"
162,INTRODUCTION,"his work in his own new stanzas following, and it would be less than"
163,INTRODUCTION,impiety to part the two.
164,INTRODUCTION,
165,INTRODUCTION,I have obeyed a profound conviction which I have reason to hope will be
166,INTRODUCTION,"more commended in the future than perhaps it can be now, in leaving aside"
167,INTRODUCTION,"a multitude of composite songs—anachronisms, and worse than mere"
168,INTRODUCTION,"anachronisms, as I think them to be, for they patch wild feeling with"
169,INTRODUCTION,sentiment of the sentimentalist.  There are some exceptions.  The one
170,INTRODUCTION,fine stanza of a song which both Sir Walter Scott and Burns restored is
171,INTRODUCTION,"given with the restorations of both, those restorations being severally"
172,INTRODUCTION,"beautiful; and the burden, ‘Hame, hame, hame,’ is printed with the"
173,INTRODUCTION,Jacobite song that carries it; this song seems so mingled and various in
174,INTRODUCTION,date and origin that no apology is needed for placing it amongst the
175,INTRODUCTION,bundle of Scottish ballads of days before the Jacobites.  _Sir Patrick
176,INTRODUCTION,Spens_ is treated here as an ancient song.  It is to be noted that the
177,INTRODUCTION,"modern, or comparatively modern, additions to old songs full of"
178,INTRODUCTION,"quantitative metre—‘Hame, hame, hame,’ is one of these—full of long"
179,INTRODUCTION,"notes, rests, and interlinear pauses, are almost always written in"
180,INTRODUCTION,"anapæsts.  The later writer has slipped away from the fine, various, and"
181,INTRODUCTION,"subtle metre of the older.  Assuredly the popularity of the metre which,"
182,INTRODUCTION,"for want of a term suiting the English rules of verse, must be called"
183,INTRODUCTION,"anapæstic, has done more than any other thing to vulgarise the national"
184,INTRODUCTION,sense of rhythm and to silence the finer rhythms.  Anapæsts came quite
185,INTRODUCTION,"suddenly into English poetry and brought coarseness, glibness,"
186,INTRODUCTION,"volubility, dapper and fatuous effects.  A master may use it well, but as"
187,INTRODUCTION,a popular measure it has been disastrous.  I would be bound to find the
188,INTRODUCTION,modern stanzas in an old song by this very habit of anapæsts and this
189,INTRODUCTION,very misunderstanding of the long words and interlinear pauses of the
190,INTRODUCTION,"older stanzas.  This, for instance, is the old metre:"
191,INTRODUCTION,
192,INTRODUCTION,"‘Hame, hame, hame!  O hame fain wad I be!’"
193,INTRODUCTION,
194,INTRODUCTION,and this the lamentable anapæstic line (from the same song):
195,INTRODUCTION,
196,INTRODUCTION,‘Yet the sun through the mirk seems to promise to me—.’
197,INTRODUCTION,
198,INTRODUCTION,It has been difficult to refuse myself the delight of including _A Divine
199,INTRODUCTION,"Love_ of Carew, but it seemed too bold to leave out four stanzas of a"
200,INTRODUCTION,"poem of seven, and the last four are of the poorest argument.  This"
201,INTRODUCTION,passage at least shall speak for the first three:
202,INTRODUCTION,
203,INTRODUCTION,‘Thou didst appear
204,INTRODUCTION,"A glorious mystery, so dark, so clear,"
205,INTRODUCTION,As Nature did intend
206,INTRODUCTION,"All should confess, but none might comprehend.’"
207,INTRODUCTION,
208,INTRODUCTION,From _Christ’s Victory in Heaven_ of Giles Fletcher (out of reach for its
209,INTRODUCTION,length) it is a happiness to extract here at least the passage upon
210,INTRODUCTION,"‘Justice,’ who looks ‘as the eagle"
211,INTRODUCTION,
212,INTRODUCTION,that hath so oft compared
213,INTRODUCTION,Her eye with heaven’s’;
214,INTRODUCTION,
215,INTRODUCTION,"from Marlowe’s poem, also unmanageable, that in which Love ran to the"
216,INTRODUCTION,priestess
217,INTRODUCTION,
218,INTRODUCTION,‘And laid his childish head upon her breast’;
219,INTRODUCTION,
220,INTRODUCTION,"with that which tells how Night,"
221,INTRODUCTION,
222,INTRODUCTION,"‘deep-drenched in misty Acheron,"
223,INTRODUCTION,"Heaved up her head, and half the world upon"
224,INTRODUCTION,Breathed darkness forth’;
225,INTRODUCTION,
226,INTRODUCTION,from Robert Greene two lines of a lovely passage:
227,INTRODUCTION,
228,INTRODUCTION,"‘Cupid abroad was lated in the night,"
229,INTRODUCTION,His wings were wet with ranging in the rain’;
230,INTRODUCTION,
231,INTRODUCTION,from Ben Jonson’s _Hue and Cry_ (not throughout fine) the stanza:
232,INTRODUCTION,
233,INTRODUCTION,"‘Beauties, have ye seen a toy,"
234,INTRODUCTION,"Called Love, a little boy,"
235,INTRODUCTION,"Almost naked, wanton, blind;"
236,INTRODUCTION,"Cruel now, and then as kind?"
237,INTRODUCTION,"If he be amongst ye, say;"
238,INTRODUCTION,He is Venus’ run-away’;
239,INTRODUCTION,
240,INTRODUCTION,from Francis Davison:
241,INTRODUCTION,
242,INTRODUCTION,‘Her angry eyes are great with tears’;
243,INTRODUCTION,
244,INTRODUCTION,from George Wither:
245,INTRODUCTION,
246,INTRODUCTION,‘I can go rest
247,INTRODUCTION,On her sweet breast
248,INTRODUCTION,That is the pride of Cynthia’s train’;
249,INTRODUCTION,
250,INTRODUCTION,from Cowley:
251,INTRODUCTION,
252,INTRODUCTION,"‘Return, return, gay planet of mine east’!"
253,INTRODUCTION,
254,INTRODUCTION,"The poems in which these are cannot make part of the volume, but the"
255,INTRODUCTION,citation of the fragments is a relieving act of love.
256,INTRODUCTION,
257,INTRODUCTION,"At the very beginning, Skelton’s song to ‘Mistress Margery Wentworth’ had"
258,INTRODUCTION,almost taken a place; but its charm is hardly fine enough.  If it is
259,INTRODUCTION,"necessary to answer the inevitable question in regard to Byron, let me"
260,INTRODUCTION,"say that in another Anthology, a secondary Anthology, the one in which"
261,INTRODUCTION,"Gray’s _Elegy_ would have an honourable place, some more of Byron’s"
262,INTRODUCTION,lyrics would certainly be found; and except this there is no apology.  If
263,INTRODUCTION,"the last stanza of the ‘Dying Gladiator’ passage, or the last stanza on"
264,INTRODUCTION,"the cascade rainbow at Terni,"
265,INTRODUCTION,
266,INTRODUCTION,"‘Love watching madness with unalterable mien,’"
267,INTRODUCTION,
268,INTRODUCTION,"had been separate poems instead of parts of _Childe Harold_, they would"
269,INTRODUCTION,have been amongst the poems that are here collected in no spirit of
270,INTRODUCTION,"arrogance, or of caprice, of diffidence or doubt."
271,INTRODUCTION,
272,INTRODUCTION,The volume closes some time before the middle of the century and the
273,INTRODUCTION,death of Wordsworth.

748,EPITHALAMION,"That shall, for all the pains and sorrows past,"
749,EPITHALAMION,Pay to her usury of long delight:
750,EPITHALAMION,"And, whilst she doth her dight,"
751,EPITHALAMION,"Do ye to her of joy and solace sing,"
752,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring."
753,EPITHALAMION,
754,EPITHALAMION,Bring with you all the Nymphs that you can hear
755,EPITHALAMION,"Both of the rivers and the forests green,"
756,EPITHALAMION,And of the sea that neighbours to her near:
757,EPITHALAMION,All with gay garlands goodly well beseen.
758,EPITHALAMION,And let them also with them bring in hand
759,EPITHALAMION,"Another gay garland,"
760,EPITHALAMION,"For my fair love, of lilies and of roses,"
761,EPITHALAMION,"Bound truelove wise, with a blue silk riband."
762,EPITHALAMION,"And let them make great store of bridal posies,"
763,EPITHALAMION,"And let them eke bring store of other flowers,"
764,EPITHALAMION,To deck the bridal bowers.
765,EPITHALAMION,"And let the ground whereas her foot shall tread,"
766,EPITHALAMION,"For fear the stones her tender foot should wrong,"
767,EPITHALAMION,"Be strewed with fragrant flowers all along,"
768,EPITHALAMION,And diapred like the discoloured mead.
769,EPITHALAMION,"Which done, do at her chamber door await,"
770,EPITHALAMION,For she will waken straight;
771,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles do ye this song unto her sing,"
772,EPITHALAMION,"The woods shall to you answer, and your echo ring."
773,EPITHALAMION,
774,EPITHALAMION,"Ye Nymphs of Mulla, which with careful heed"
775,EPITHALAMION,"The silver scaly trouts do tend full well,"
776,EPITHALAMION,And greedy pikes which use therein to feed
777,EPITHALAMION,(Those trouts and pikes all others do excel);
778,EPITHALAMION,"And ye likewise, which keep the rushy lake,"
779,EPITHALAMION,Where none do fishes take;
780,EPITHALAMION,"Bind up the locks the which hang scattered light,"
781,EPITHALAMION,"And in his waters, which your mirror make,"
782,EPITHALAMION,"Behold your faces as the crystal bright,"
783,EPITHALAMION,"That when you come whereas my love doth lie,"
784,EPITHALAMION,No blemish she may spy.
785,EPITHALAMION,"And eke, ye lightfoot maids, which keep the door,"
786,EPITHALAMION,That on the hoary mountain used to tower;
787,EPITHALAMION,"And the wild wolves, which seek them to devour,"
788,EPITHALAMION,With your steel darts do chase from coming near;
789,EPITHALAMION,"Be also present here,"
790,EPITHALAMION,"To help to deck her, and to help to sing,"
791,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring."
792,EPITHALAMION,
793,EPITHALAMION,"Wake now, my love, awake! for it is time:"
794,EPITHALAMION,"The Rosy Morn long since left Tithon’s bed,"
795,EPITHALAMION,All ready to her silver coach to climb;
796,EPITHALAMION,And Phœbus ’gins to show his glorious head.
797,EPITHALAMION,Hark! how the cheerful birds do chant their lays
798,EPITHALAMION,And carol of love’s praise.
799,EPITHALAMION,The merry Lark her matins sings aloft;
800,EPITHALAMION,The Thrush replies; the Mavis descant plays:
801,EPITHALAMION,The Ouzel shrills; the Ruddock warbles soft;
802,EPITHALAMION,"So goodly all agree, with sweet consent,"
803,EPITHALAMION,To this day’s merriment.
804,EPITHALAMION,"Ah! my dear love, why do ye sleep thus long,"
805,EPITHALAMION,"When meeter were that ye should now awake,"
806,EPITHALAMION,"T’ await the coming of your joyous make,"
807,EPITHALAMION,"And hearken to the birds’ love-learned song,"
808,EPITHALAMION,The dewy leaves among?
809,EPITHALAMION,"For they of joy and pleasance to you sing,"
810,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring."
811,EPITHALAMION,
812,EPITHALAMION,"My love is now awake out of her dreams,"
813,EPITHALAMION,"And her fair eyes, like stars that dimmed were"
814,EPITHALAMION,"With darksome cloud, now show their goodly beams"
815,EPITHALAMION,More bright than Hesperus his head doth rear.
816,EPITHALAMION,"Come now, ye damsels, daughters of delight,"
817,EPITHALAMION,Help quickly her to dight!
818,EPITHALAMION,"But first come, ye fair hours, which were begot,"
819,EPITHALAMION,"In Jove’s sweet paradise, of Day and Night;"
820,EPITHALAMION,"Which do the seasons of the year allot,"
821,EPITHALAMION,"And all, that ever in this world is fair,"
822,EPITHALAMION,Do make and still repair:
823,EPITHALAMION,"And ye three handmaids of the Cyprian Queen,"
824,EPITHALAMION,"The which do still adorn her beauty’s pride,"
825,EPITHALAMION,Help to adorn my beautifullest bride:
826,EPITHALAMION,"And, as ye her array, still throw between"
827,EPITHALAMION,Some graces to be seen;
828,EPITHALAMION,"And, as ye use to Venus, to her sing,"
829,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles the woods shall answer, and your echo ring."
830,EPITHALAMION,
831,EPITHALAMION,Now is my love all ready forth to come:
832,EPITHALAMION,Let all the virgins therefore well await:
833,EPITHALAMION,"And ye, fresh boys, that tend upon her groom,"
834,EPITHALAMION,"Prepare yourselves, for he is coming straight."
835,EPITHALAMION,"Set all your things in seemly good array,"
836,EPITHALAMION,Fit for so joyful day:
837,EPITHALAMION,The joyfullest day that ever Sun did see.
838,EPITHALAMION,"Fair Sun! show forth thy favourable ray,"
839,EPITHALAMION,"And let thy life-full heat not fervent be,"
840,EPITHALAMION,"For fear of burning her sunshiny face,"
841,EPITHALAMION,Her beauty to disgrace.
842,EPITHALAMION,O fairest Phœbus! father of the Muse!
843,EPITHALAMION,"If ever I did honour thee aright,"
844,EPITHALAMION,"Or sing the thing that mote thy mind delight,"
845,EPITHALAMION,Do not thy servant’s simple boon refuse;
846,EPITHALAMION,"But let this day, let this one day, be mine;"
847,EPITHALAMION,Let all the rest be thine.
848,EPITHALAMION,"Then I thy sovereign praises loud will sing,"
849,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods shall answer, and their echo ring."
850,EPITHALAMION,
851,EPITHALAMION,Hark! how the minstrels ’gin to shrill aloud
852,EPITHALAMION,"Their merry Music that resounds from far,"
853,EPITHALAMION,"The pipe, the tabor, and the trembling crowd,"
854,EPITHALAMION,That well agree withouten breach or jar.
855,EPITHALAMION,"But, most of all, the damsels do delight"
856,EPITHALAMION,"When they their timbrels smite,"
857,EPITHALAMION,"And thereunto do dance and carol sweet,"
858,EPITHALAMION,That all the senses they do ravish quite;
859,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles the boys run up and down the street,"
860,EPITHALAMION,"Crying aloud with strong confused noise,"
861,EPITHALAMION,"As if it were one voice,"
862,EPITHALAMION,"Hymen! iö Hymen!  Hymen, they do shout;"
863,EPITHALAMION,That even to the heavens their shouting shrill
864,EPITHALAMION,"Doth reach, and all the firmament doth fill;"
865,EPITHALAMION,"To which the people standing all about,"
866,EPITHALAMION,"As in approvance, do thereto applaud,"
867,EPITHALAMION,And loud advance her laud;
868,EPITHALAMION,"And evermore they Hymen, Hymen! sing,"
869,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring."
870,EPITHALAMION,
871,EPITHALAMION,"Lo! where she comes along with portly pace,"
872,EPITHALAMION,"Like Phœbe, from her chamber of the East,"
873,EPITHALAMION,"Arising forth to run her mighty race,"
874,EPITHALAMION,"Clad all in white, that seems a virgin best."
875,EPITHALAMION,"So well it her beseems, that ye would ween"
876,EPITHALAMION,Some angel she had been.
877,EPITHALAMION,"Her long loose yellow locks like golden wire,"
878,EPITHALAMION,"Sprinkled with pearl, and pearling flowers atween,"
879,EPITHALAMION,Do like a golden mantle her attire;
880,EPITHALAMION,"And, being crowned with a garland green,"
881,EPITHALAMION,Seem like some maiden Queen.
882,EPITHALAMION,"Her modest eyes, abashed to behold"
883,EPITHALAMION,"So many gazers as on her do stare,"
884,EPITHALAMION,Upon the lowly ground affixed are;
885,EPITHALAMION,"Ne dare lift up her countenance too bold,"
886,EPITHALAMION,"But blush to hear her praises sung so loud,"
887,EPITHALAMION,So far from being proud.
888,EPITHALAMION,"Nathless, do ye still loud her praises sing,"
889,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring."
890,EPITHALAMION,
891,EPITHALAMION,"Tell me, ye merchants’ daughters, did ye see"
892,EPITHALAMION,So fair a creature in your town before;
893,EPITHALAMION,"So sweet, so lovely, and so mild as she,"
894,EPITHALAMION,Adorned with beauty’s grace and virtue’s store?
895,EPITHALAMION,"Her goodly eyes like sapphires shining bright,"
896,EPITHALAMION,"Her forehead ivory white,"
897,EPITHALAMION,"Her cheeks like apples which the sun hath ruddied,"
898,EPITHALAMION,"Her lips like cherries charming men to bite,"
899,EPITHALAMION,"Her breast like to a bowl of cream uncrudded,"
900,EPITHALAMION,"Her paps like lilies budded,"
901,EPITHALAMION,Her snowy neck like to a marble tower;
902,EPITHALAMION,"And all her body like a palace fair,"
903,EPITHALAMION,"Ascending up, with many a stately stair,"
904,EPITHALAMION,To honour’s seat and chastity’s sweet bower.
905,EPITHALAMION,"Why stand ye still, ye virgins, in amaze,"
906,EPITHALAMION,"Upon her so to gaze,"
907,EPITHALAMION,"Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,"
908,EPITHALAMION,"To which the woods did answer, and your echo ring?"
909,EPITHALAMION,
910,EPITHALAMION,"But if ye saw that which no eyes can see,"
911,EPITHALAMION,"The inward beauty of her lively spright,"
912,EPITHALAMION,"Garnished with heavenly gifts of high degree,"
913,EPITHALAMION,"Much more then would ye wonder at that sight,"
914,EPITHALAMION,And stand astonished like to those which read
915,EPITHALAMION,Medusa’s mazeful head.
916,EPITHALAMION,"There dwells sweet love, and constant chastity,"
917,EPITHALAMION,"Unspotted faith, and comely womanhood,"
918,EPITHALAMION,"Regard of honour, and mild modesty;"
919,EPITHALAMION,"There virtue reigns as Queen in royal throne,"
920,EPITHALAMION,"And giveth laws alone,"
921,EPITHALAMION,"The which the base affections do obey,"
922,EPITHALAMION,And yield their services unto her will;
923,EPITHALAMION,Ne thought of thing uncomely ever may
924,EPITHALAMION,Thereto approach to tempt her mind to ill.
925,EPITHALAMION,Had ye once seen these her celestial treasures
926,EPITHALAMION,"And unrevealed pleasures,"
927,EPITHALAMION,"Then would ye wonder, and her praises sing,"
928,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods should answer, and your echo ring."
929,EPITHALAMION,
930,EPITHALAMION,"Open the temple gates unto my love,"
931,EPITHALAMION,"Open them wide that she may enter in,"
932,EPITHALAMION,"And all the posts adorn as doth behove,"
933,EPITHALAMION,"And all the pillars deck with garlands trim,"
934,EPITHALAMION,"For to receive this Saint with honour due,"
935,EPITHALAMION,That cometh in to you.
936,EPITHALAMION,"With trembling steps, and humble reverence,"
937,EPITHALAMION,She cometh in before th’ Almighty’s view;
938,EPITHALAMION,"Of her ye virgins learn obedience,"
939,EPITHALAMION,"When so ye come into those holy places,"
940,EPITHALAMION,To humble your proud faces:
941,EPITHALAMION,"Bring her up to th’ high altar, that she may"
942,EPITHALAMION,"The sacred ceremonies there partake,"
943,EPITHALAMION,The which do endless matrimony make;
944,EPITHALAMION,And let the roaring organs loudly play
945,EPITHALAMION,The praises of the Lord in lively notes;
946,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles, with hollow throats,"
947,EPITHALAMION,"The choristers the joyous anthem sing,"
948,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and their echo ring."
949,EPITHALAMION,
950,EPITHALAMION,"Behold, whiles she before the altar stands,"
951,EPITHALAMION,"Hearing the holy priest that to her speaks,"
952,EPITHALAMION,"And blesseth her with his two happy hands,"
953,EPITHALAMION,"How the red roses flush up in her cheeks,"
954,EPITHALAMION,"And the pure snow with goodly vermeil stain,"
955,EPITHALAMION,Lake crimson dyed in grain:
956,EPITHALAMION,"That even th’ Angels, which continually"
957,EPITHALAMION,"About the sacred altar do remain,"
958,EPITHALAMION,"Forget their service and about her fly,"
959,EPITHALAMION,"Oft peeping in her face, that seems more fair,"
960,EPITHALAMION,The more they on it stare.
961,EPITHALAMION,"But her sad eyes, still fastened on the ground,"
962,EPITHALAMION,"Are governed with goodly modesty,"
963,EPITHALAMION,"That suffers not one look to glance awry,"
964,EPITHALAMION,Which may let in a little thought unsound.
965,EPITHALAMION,"Why blush ye, love, to give to me your hand,"
966,EPITHALAMION,The pledge of all our band?
967,EPITHALAMION,"Sing, ye sweet Angels, Alleluja sing,"
968,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring."
969,EPITHALAMION,
970,EPITHALAMION,Now all is done: bring home the Bride again;
971,EPITHALAMION,Bring home the triumph of our victory:
972,EPITHALAMION,"Bring home with you the glory of her gain,"
973,EPITHALAMION,With joyance bring her and with jollity.
974,EPITHALAMION,"Never had man more joyful day than this,"
975,EPITHALAMION,Whom heaven would heap with bliss.
976,EPITHALAMION,Make feast therefore now all this live-long day;
977,EPITHALAMION,This day for ever to me holy is.
978,EPITHALAMION,"Pour out the wine without restraint or stay,"
979,EPITHALAMION,"Pour not by cups, but by the bellyful!"
980,EPITHALAMION,"Pour out to all that wull,"
981,EPITHALAMION,"And sprinkle all the posts and walls with wine,"
982,EPITHALAMION,"That they may sweat, and drunken be withal."
983,EPITHALAMION,"Crown ye God Bacchus with a coronal,"
984,EPITHALAMION,And Hymen also crown with wreaths of vine;
985,EPITHALAMION,"And let the Graces dance unto the rest,"
986,EPITHALAMION,For they can do it best:
987,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles the maidens do their carol sing,"
988,EPITHALAMION,"To which the woods shall answer, and their echo ring."
989,EPITHALAMION,
990,EPITHALAMION,"Ring ye the bells, ye young men of the town,"
991,EPITHALAMION,And leave your wonted labours for this day:
992,EPITHALAMION,"This day is holy; do ye write it down,"
993,EPITHALAMION,That ye for ever it remember may.
994,EPITHALAMION,"This day the sun is in his chiefest height,"
995,EPITHALAMION,"With Barnaby the bright,"
996,EPITHALAMION,"From whence declining daily by degrees,"
997,EPITHALAMION,"He somewhat loseth of his heat and light,"
998,EPITHALAMION,When once the Crab behind his back he sees.
999,EPITHALAMION,"But for this time it ill ordained was,"
1000,EPITHALAMION,"To choose the longest day in all the year,"
1001,EPITHALAMION,"And shortest night, when longest fitter were:"
1002,EPITHALAMION,"Yet never day so long, but late would pass."
1003,EPITHALAMION,"Ring ye the bells, to make it wear away,"
1004,EPITHALAMION,And bonfires make all day;
1005,EPITHALAMION,"And dance about them, and about them sing,"
1006,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods may answer, and your echo ring!"
1007,EPITHALAMION,
1008,EPITHALAMION,"Ah! when will this long weary day have end,"
1009,EPITHALAMION,And lend me leave to come unto my love?
1010,EPITHALAMION,How slowly do the hours their numbers spend;
1011,EPITHALAMION,How slowly does sad Time his feathers move!
1012,EPITHALAMION,"Haste thee, O fairest Planet, to thy home,"
1013,EPITHALAMION,Within the Western foam:
1014,EPITHALAMION,Thy tired steeds long since have need of rest.
1015,EPITHALAMION,"Long though it be, at last I see it gloom,"
1016,EPITHALAMION,And the bright evening-star with golden crest
1017,EPITHALAMION,"Appear out of the East,"
1018,EPITHALAMION,Fair child of beauty! glorious lamp of love!
1019,EPITHALAMION,"That all the host of heaven in ranks dost lead,"
1020,EPITHALAMION,"And guidest lovers through the night’s sad dread,"
1021,EPITHALAMION,"How cheerfully thou lookest from above,"
1022,EPITHALAMION,"And seem’st to laugh atween thy twinkling light,"
1023,EPITHALAMION,As joying in the sight
1024,EPITHALAMION,"Of these glad many, which for joy do sing,"
1025,EPITHALAMION,"That all the woods them answer, and their echo ring!"
1026,EPITHALAMION,
1027,EPITHALAMION,"Now cease, ye damsels, your delights forepast;"
1028,EPITHALAMION,Enough it is that all the day was yours:
1029,EPITHALAMION,"Now day is done, and night is nighing fast,"
1030,EPITHALAMION,Now bring the Bride into the bridal bowers.
1031,EPITHALAMION,"The night is come; now soon her disarray,"
1032,EPITHALAMION,And in her bed her lay;
1033,EPITHALAMION,"Lay her in lilies and in violets,"
1034,EPITHALAMION,"And silken curtains over her display,"
1035,EPITHALAMION,"And odoured sheets, and arras coverlets."
1036,EPITHALAMION,"Behold how goodly my fair love does lie,"
1037,EPITHALAMION,In proud humility!
1038,EPITHALAMION,"Like unto Maia, when as Jove her took"
1039,EPITHALAMION,"In Tempe, lying on the flowery grass,"
1040,EPITHALAMION,"’Twixt sleep and wake, after she weary was,"
1041,EPITHALAMION,With bathing in the Acidalian brook.
1042,EPITHALAMION,"Now it is night, ye damsels may be gone,"
1043,EPITHALAMION,"And leave my love alone,"
1044,EPITHALAMION,And leave likewise your former lay to sing:
1045,EPITHALAMION,"The woods no more shall answer, nor your echo ring."
1046,EPITHALAMION,
1047,EPITHALAMION,"Now welcome, night! thou night so long expected,"
1048,EPITHALAMION,"That long day’s labour dost at last defray,"
1049,EPITHALAMION,"And all my cares, which cruel Love collected,"
1050,EPITHALAMION,"Hast summed in one, and cancelled for aye:"
1051,EPITHALAMION,"Spread thy broad wing over my love and me,"
1052,EPITHALAMION,That no man may us see;
1053,EPITHALAMION,"And in thy sable mantle us enwrap,"
1054,EPITHALAMION,From fear of peril and foul horror free.
1055,EPITHALAMION,"Let no false treason seek us to entrap,"
1056,EPITHALAMION,Nor any dread disquiet once annoy
1057,EPITHALAMION,The safety of our joy;
1058,EPITHALAMION,"But let the night be calm, and quietsome,"
1059,EPITHALAMION,Without tempestuous storms or sad affray:
1060,EPITHALAMION,"Like as when Jove with fair Alcmena lay,"
1061,EPITHALAMION,When he begot the great Tirynthian groom:
1062,EPITHALAMION,Or like as when he with thy self did lie
1063,EPITHALAMION,And begot Majesty.
1064,EPITHALAMION,And let the maids and young men cease to sing;
1065,EPITHALAMION,"Ne let the woods them answer, nor their echo ring."
1066,EPITHALAMION,
1067,EPITHALAMION,Let no lamenting cries nor doleful tears
1068,EPITHALAMION,"Be heard all night within, nor yet without;"
1069,EPITHALAMION,"Ne let false whispers, breeding hidden fears,"
1070,EPITHALAMION,Break gentle sleep with misconceived doubt.
1071,EPITHALAMION,"Let no deluding dreams, nor dreadful sights,"
1072,EPITHALAMION,Make sudden sad affrights;
1073,EPITHALAMION,"Ne let house-fires, nor lightning’s helpless harms,"
1074,EPITHALAMION,"Ne let the Pouke, nor other evil sprights,"
1075,EPITHALAMION,"Ne let mischievous witches with their charms,"
1076,EPITHALAMION,"Ne let hobgoblins, names whose sense we see not,"
1077,EPITHALAMION,Fray us with things that be not:
1078,EPITHALAMION,"Let not the shriek-owl nor the stork be heard,"
1079,EPITHALAMION,"Nor the night raven, that still deadly yells;"
1080,EPITHALAMION,"Nor damned ghosts, called up with mighty spells,"
1081,EPITHALAMION,"Nor grisly vultures, make us once afeard:"
1082,EPITHALAMION,Ne let the unpleasant choir of frogs still croaking
1083,EPITHALAMION,Make us to wish their choking!
1084,EPITHALAMION,Let none of these their dreary accents sing;
1085,EPITHALAMION,"Ne let the woods them answer, nor their echo ring."
1086,EPITHALAMION,
1087,EPITHALAMION,"But let still Silence true night-watches keep,"
1088,EPITHALAMION,"That sacred Peace may in assurance reign,"
1089,EPITHALAMION,"And timely Sleep, when it is time to sleep,"
1090,EPITHALAMION,May pour his limbs forth on your pleasant plain;
1091,EPITHALAMION,"The whiles an hundred little winged loves,"
1092,EPITHALAMION,"Like divers-feathered doves,"
1093,EPITHALAMION,"Shall fly and flutter round about your bed,"
1094,EPITHALAMION,"And in the secret dark, that none reproves,"
1095,EPITHALAMION,"Their pretty stealths shall work, and snares shall spread"
1096,EPITHALAMION,"To filch away sweet snatches of delight,"
1097,EPITHALAMION,Concealed through covert night.
1098,EPITHALAMION,"Ye sons of Venus, play your sports at will!"
1099,EPITHALAMION,"For greedy Pleasure, careless of your toys,"
1100,EPITHALAMION,"Thinks more upon her paradise of joys,"
1101,EPITHALAMION,"Then what ye do, albeit good or ill!"
1102,EPITHALAMION,"All night therefore attend your merry play,"
1103,EPITHALAMION,For it will soon be day:
1104,EPITHALAMION,"Now none doth hinder you, that say or sing;"
1105,EPITHALAMION,"Ne will the woods now answer, nor your echo ring."
1106,EPITHALAMION,
1107,EPITHALAMION,"Who is the same, which at my window peeps,"
1108,EPITHALAMION,Or whose is that fair face that shines so bright?
1109,EPITHALAMION,"Is it not Cynthia, she that never sleeps,"
1110,EPITHALAMION,But walks about high heaven all the night?
1111,EPITHALAMION,"O! fairest goddess, do thou not envy"
1112,EPITHALAMION,My love with me to spy:
1113,EPITHALAMION,"For thou likewise didst love, though now unthought,"
1114,EPITHALAMION,"And for a fleece of wool, which privily"
1115,EPITHALAMION,"The Latmian shepherd once unto thee brought,"
1116,EPITHALAMION,His pleasures with thee wrought!
1117,EPITHALAMION,Therefore to us be favourable now;
1118,EPITHALAMION,"And sith of women’s labours thou hast charge,"
1119,EPITHALAMION,"And generation goodly dost enlarge,"
1120,EPITHALAMION,"Incline thy will to effect our wishful vow,"
1121,EPITHALAMION,"And the chaste womb inform with timely seed,"
1122,EPITHALAMION,That may our comfort breed:
1123,EPITHALAMION,Till which we cease our hopeful hap to sing;
1124,EPITHALAMION,"Ne let the woods us answer, nor our echo ring."
1125,EPITHALAMION,

1804,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Consumed with that which it was nourished by:
1805,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"This thou perceiv’st, which makes thy love more strong,"

1829,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
1830,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,When you have bid your servant once adieu:
1831,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
1832,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,"
1833,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought"
1834,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Save, where you are how happy you make those;—"

1843,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,"
1844,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Desiring this man’s heart, and that man’s scope,"
1845,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,With what I most enjoy contented least;
1846,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,"
1847,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Haply I think on Thee—and then my state,"
1848,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Like to the lark at break of day arising
1849,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
1850,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
1851,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
1852,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1853,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"THEY that have power to hurt, and will do none,"
1854,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"That do not do the thing they most do show,"

1856,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,—"
1857,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"They rightly do inherit heaven’s graces,"
1858,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And husband nature’s riches from expense;
1859,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"They are the lords and owners of their faces,"
1860,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Others, but stewards of their excellence."
1861,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"The summer’s flower is to the summer sweet,"
1862,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Though to itself it only live and die;
1863,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"But if that flower with base infection meet,"
1864,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
1865,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
1866,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
1867,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1868,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"FAREWELL! thou art too dear for my possessing,"
1869,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And like enough thou know’st thy estimate:
1870,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
1871,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,My bonds in thee are all determinate.
1872,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
1873,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And for that riches where is my deserving?
1874,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,"
1875,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And so my patent back again is swerving.
1876,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Thyself thou gav’st, thy own worth then not knowing,"
1877,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Or me, to whom thou gav’st it, else mistaking;"
1878,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,"
1879,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Comes home again, on better judgment making."
1880,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter;
1881,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"In sleep, a king; but waking, no such matter."
1882,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1883,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,WHEN to the sessions of sweet silent thought
1884,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"I summon up remembrance of things past,"
1885,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,"
1886,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste;
1887,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,"
1888,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"For precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,"
1889,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"And weep afresh love’s long-since-cancelled woe,"
1890,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And moan the expense of many a vanished sight.
1891,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,"
1892,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And heavily from woe to woe tell o’er
1893,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"The sad account of fore-bemoanèd moan,"
1894,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Which I new pay as if not paid before:
1895,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,"
1896,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"All losses are restored, and sorrows end."
1897,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1898,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,DID not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
1899,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"’Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,"
1900,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
1901,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
1902,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"A woman I forswore; but I will prove,"
1903,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:"
1904,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;"
1905,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Thy grace being gained cures all disgrace in me.
1906,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;"
1907,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,"
1908,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
1909,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"If broken, then it is no fault of mine."
1910,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"If by me broke, what fool is not so wise"
1911,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"To break an oath, to win a paradise?"
1912,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1913,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,THE forward violet thus did I chide:
1914,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,"
1915,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,If not from my love’s breath?  The purple pride
1916,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
1917,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,In my love’s veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
1918,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"The lily I condemned for thy hand,"
1919,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And buds of marjoram had stol’n thy hair:
1920,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,"
1921,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"One blushing shame, another white despair;"
1922,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"A third, nor red nor white, had stol’n of both"
1923,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And to his robbery had annexed thy breath;
1924,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth"
1925,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
1926,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"More flowers I noted, yet I none could see"
1927,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,But sweet or colour it had stol’n from thee.
1928,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1929,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"O, LEST the world should task you to recite"
1930,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"What merit lived in me, that you should love"
1931,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"After my death, dear love, forget me quite,"
1932,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
1933,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,"
1934,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"To do more for me than mine own desert,"
1935,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And hang more praise upon deceased I
1936,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
1937,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"O, lest your true love may seem false in this,"
1938,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"That you for love speak well of me untrue,"
1939,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"My name be buried where my body is,"
1940,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
1941,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,"
1942,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"And so should you, to love things nothing worth."
1943,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1944,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,LET me not to the marriage of true minds
1945,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Admit impediments.  Love is not love
1946,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Which alters when it alteration finds,"
1947,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Or bends with the remover to remove:
1948,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark"
1949,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
1950,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"It is the star to every wandering bark,"
1951,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Whose worth’s unknown, although his height be taken."
1952,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks"
1953,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Within his bending sickle’s compass come;
1954,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,"
1955,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
1956,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"If this be error and upon me proved,"
1957,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"I never writ, nor no man ever loved."
1958,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1959,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"HOW oft, when thou, my music, music play’st,"
1960,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
1961,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway’st"
1962,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,"
1963,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
1964,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,"
1965,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,"
1966,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,At the wood’s boldness by thee blushing stand!
1967,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"To be so tickled, they would change their state"
1968,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"And situation with those dancing chips,"
1969,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"O’er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,"
1970,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
1971,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,"
1972,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss."
1973,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1974,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,FULL many a glorious morning have I seen
1975,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,"
1976,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Kissing with golden face the meadows green,"
1977,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
1978,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
1979,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"With ugly rack on his celestial face,"
1980,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"And from the forlorn world his visage hide,"
1981,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
1982,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Even so my sun one early morn did shine
1983,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"With all-triumphant splendour on my brow,"
1984,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;"
1985,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
1986,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth:
1987,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Suns of the world may stain when heaven’s sun staineth.
1988,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,
1989,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,THE expense of spirit in a waste of shame
1990,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Is lust in action; and till action, lust"
1991,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,"
1992,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,"
1993,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,"
1994,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Past reason hunted, and no sooner had"
1995,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Past reason hated, as a swallow’d bait"
1996,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
1997,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
1998,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;"
1999,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;"
2000,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,"Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream."
2001,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
2002,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

3986,THE COLLAR,Recover all thy sigh-blown age
3987,THE COLLAR,On double pleasures; leave thy cold dispute
3988,THE COLLAR,"Of what is fit and not; forsake thy cage,"
3989,THE COLLAR,"Thy rope of sands,"
3990,THE COLLAR,Which petty thoughts have made; and made to thee
3991,THE COLLAR,"Good cable, to enforce and draw,"

4351,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Smoothly the waters kist,"
4352,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Whispering new joys to the mild ocean,"
4353,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Who now hath quite forgot to rave,"
4354,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.
4355,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4356,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"The stars, with deep amaze,"
4357,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Stand fixed in steadfast gaze,"
4358,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Bending one way their precious influence;
4359,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And will not take their flight
4360,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"For all the morning light,"
4361,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Or Lucifer that often warned them thence;
4362,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"But in their glimmering orbs did glow,"
4363,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Until their Lord Himself bespake, and bid them go."
4364,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4365,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And though the shady gloom
4366,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Had given day her room,"
4367,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"The sun himself withheld his wonted speed,"
4368,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"And hid his head for shame,"
4369,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,As his inferior flame
4370,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The new-enlightened world no more should need;
4371,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,He saw a greater Sun appear
4372,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Than his bright throne or burning axletree could bear.
4373,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4374,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"The shepherds on the lawn,"
4375,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Or ere the point of dawn,"
4376,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;
4377,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Full little thought they than
4378,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,That the mighty Pan
4379,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Was kindly come to live with them below;
4380,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,"
4381,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.
4382,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4383,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,When such music sweet
4384,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Their hearts and ears did greet
4385,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,As never was by mortal fingers strook—
4386,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Divinely-warbled voice
4387,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Answering the stringed noise,"
4388,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,As all their souls in blissful rapture took;
4389,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"The air, such pleasure loth to lose,"
4390,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.
4391,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4392,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Nature, that heard such sound"
4393,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Beneath the hollow round
4394,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Of Cynthia’s seat the airy region thrilling,"
4395,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Now was almost won
4396,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"To think her part was done,"
4397,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;
4398,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,She knew such harmony alone
4399,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Could hold all Heaven and Earth in happier union.
4400,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4401,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,At last surrounds their sight
4402,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"A globe of circular light,"
4403,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,That with long beams the shamefaced night arrayed;
4404,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The helmed Cherubim
4405,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And sworded Seraphim
4406,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed,"
4407,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Harping in loud and solemn quire,"
4408,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"With unexpressive notes, to Heaven’s new-born Heir."
4409,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4410,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Such music (as ’tis said)
4411,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Before was never made
4412,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"But when of old the Sons of Morning sung,"
4413,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,While the Creator great
4414,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"His constellations set,"
4415,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And the well-balanced world on hinges hung;
4416,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"And cast the dark foundations deep,"
4417,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep.
4418,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4419,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Ring out, ye crystal spheres!"
4420,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Once bless our human ears,"
4421,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,If ye have power to touch our senses so;
4422,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And let your silver chime
4423,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Move in melodious time;
4424,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And let the bass of heaven’s deep organ blow;
4425,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And with your ninefold harmony
4426,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Make up full consort to the angelic symphony.
4427,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4428,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,For if such holy song
4429,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Enwrap our fancy long,"
4430,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Time will run back and fetch the age of gold;
4431,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And speckled Vanity
4432,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Will sicken soon and die,"
4433,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould;
4434,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"And Hell itself will pass away,"
4435,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.
4436,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4437,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Yea, Truth and Justice then"
4438,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Will down return to men,"
4439,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Orbed in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,"
4440,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Mercy will sit between
4441,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Throned in celestial sheen,"
4442,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering;
4443,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"And Heaven, as at some festival,"
4444,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Will open wide the gates of her high palace-hall.
4445,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4446,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,But wisest Fate says No;
4447,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,This must not yet be so;
4448,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy
4449,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,That on the bitter cross
4450,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Must redeem our loss;
4451,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,So both Himself and us to glorify:
4452,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Yet first, to those ychained in sleep,"
4453,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,"
4454,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4455,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,With such a horrid clang
4456,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"As on Mount Sinai rang,"
4457,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,While the red fire and smouldering clouds out-brake:
4458,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The aged Earth aghast
4459,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,With terror of that blast
4460,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Shall from the surface to the centre shake,"
4461,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"When, at the world’s last session,"
4462,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread His throne.
4463,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4464,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And then at last our bliss
4465,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Full and perfect is,"
4466,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,But now begins; for from this happy day
4467,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"The old Dragon under ground,"
4468,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"In straiter limits bound,"
4469,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Not half so far casts his usurped sway;
4470,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"And, wroth to see his kingdom fail,"
4471,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.
4472,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4473,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The Oracles are dumb;
4474,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,No voice or hideous hum
4475,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.
4476,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Apollo from his shrine
4477,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Can no more divine,"
4478,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving:
4479,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,No nightly trance or breathed spell
4480,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.
4481,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4482,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The lonely mountains o’er
4483,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And the resounding shore
4484,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;
4485,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,From haunted spring and dale
4486,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Edged with poplar pale,"
4487,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The parting Genius is with sighing sent;
4488,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,With flower-inwoven tresses torn
4489,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.
4490,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4491,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,In consecrated earth
4492,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And on the holy hearth
4493,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint;
4494,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"In urns, and altars round,"
4495,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,A drear and dying sound
4496,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;
4497,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"And the chill marble seems to sweat,"
4498,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,While each peculiar Power forgoes his wonted seat.
4499,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4500,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Peor and Baalim
4501,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Forsake their temples dim,"
4502,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,With that twice-battered god of Palestine;
4503,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"And mooned Ashtaroth,"
4504,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Heaven’s queen and mother both,"
4505,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Now sits not girt with tapers’ holy shine;
4506,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The Lybic Hammon shrinks his horn:
4507,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.
4508,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4509,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"And sullen Moloch, fled,"
4510,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Hath left in shadows dread
4511,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,His burning idol all of blackest hue;
4512,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,In vain with cymbals’ ring
4513,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"They call the grisly king,"
4514,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,In dismal dance about the furnace blue;
4515,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"The brutish gods of Nile as fast,"
4516,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Isis, and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste."
4517,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4518,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Nor is Osiris seen
4519,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"In Memphian grove or green,"
4520,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud:
4521,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Nor can he be at rest
4522,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Within his sacred chest;
4523,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Nought but profoundest Hell can be his shroud;
4524,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,In vain with timbrelled anthems dark
4525,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark.
4526,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4527,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,He feels from Juda’s land
4528,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The dreaded Infant’s hand;
4529,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn;
4530,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Nor all the gods beside
4531,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Longer dare abide,"
4532,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:
4533,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Our Babe, to show His Godhead true,"
4534,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Can in His swaddling bands control the damned crew.
4535,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4536,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"So, when the sun in bed,"
4537,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Curtained with cloudy red,"
4538,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Pillows his chin upon an orient wave,"
4539,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,The flocking shadows pale
4540,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Troop to the infernal jail,"
4541,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Each fettered ghost slips to his several grave;
4542,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And the yellow-skirted fays
4543,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-loved maze."
4544,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4545,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,But see! the Virgin blest
4546,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Hath laid her Babe to rest;
4547,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Time is, our tedious song should here have ending:"
4548,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Heaven’s youngest-teemed star
4549,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,"Hath fixed her polished car,"
4550,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending:
4551,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,And all about the courtly stable
4552,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,Bright-harnessed Angels sit in order serviceable.
4553,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4554,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4555,HYMN ON CHRIST’S NATIVITY,
4556,L’ALLEGRO,L’ALLEGRO
4557,L’ALLEGRO,
4558,L’ALLEGRO,
4559,L’ALLEGRO,"HENCE, loathed Melancholy,"
4560,L’ALLEGRO,Of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born
4561,L’ALLEGRO,"In Stygian cave forlorn,"
4562,L’ALLEGRO,"’Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy!"
4563,L’ALLEGRO,Find out some uncouth cell
4564,L’ALLEGRO,Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings
4565,L’ALLEGRO,And the night-raven sings;
4566,L’ALLEGRO,"There under ebon shades, and low-browed rocks"
4567,L’ALLEGRO,"As ragged as thy locks,"
4568,L’ALLEGRO,In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell.
4569,L’ALLEGRO,
4570,L’ALLEGRO,"But come, thou goddess fair and free,"
4571,L’ALLEGRO,"In heaven yclept Euphrosyne,"
4572,L’ALLEGRO,"And by men, heart-easing Mirth,"
4573,L’ALLEGRO,Whom lovely Venus at a birth
4574,L’ALLEGRO,With two sister Graces more
4575,L’ALLEGRO,To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;
4576,L’ALLEGRO,Or whether (as some sager sing)
4577,L’ALLEGRO,"The frolic wind that breathes the spring,"
4578,L’ALLEGRO,"Zephyr, with Aurora playing,"
4579,L’ALLEGRO,As he met her once a-Maying—
4580,L’ALLEGRO,There on beds of violets blue
4581,L’ALLEGRO,And fresh-blown roses washed in dew
4582,L’ALLEGRO,"Filled her with thee, a daughter fair,"
4583,L’ALLEGRO,"So buxom, blithe, and debonair."
4584,L’ALLEGRO,"Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee"
4585,L’ALLEGRO,"Jest, and youthful jollity,"
4586,L’ALLEGRO,"Quips, and cranks, and wanton wiles,"
4587,L’ALLEGRO,"Nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles,"
4588,L’ALLEGRO,"Such as hang on Hebe’s cheek,"
4589,L’ALLEGRO,And love to live in dimple sleek;
4590,L’ALLEGRO,"Sport that wrinkled Care derides,"
4591,L’ALLEGRO,And Laughter holding both his sides:—
4592,L’ALLEGRO,"Come, and trip it as you go"
4593,L’ALLEGRO,On the light fantastic toe;
4594,L’ALLEGRO,And in thy right hand lead with thee
4595,L’ALLEGRO,"The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty;"
4596,L’ALLEGRO,"And if I give thee honour due,"
4597,L’ALLEGRO,"Mirth, admit me of thy crew,"
4598,L’ALLEGRO,"To live with her, and live with thee"
4599,L’ALLEGRO,In unreproved pleasures free;
4600,L’ALLEGRO,To hear the lark begin his flight
4601,L’ALLEGRO,And singing startle the dull night
4602,L’ALLEGRO,"From his watch-tower in the skies,"
4603,L’ALLEGRO,Till the dappled dawn doth rise;
4604,L’ALLEGRO,"Then to come, in spite of sorrow,"
4605,L’ALLEGRO,And at my window bid good-morrow
4606,L’ALLEGRO,"Through the sweetbriar, or the vine,"
4607,L’ALLEGRO,Or the twisted eglantine:
4608,L’ALLEGRO,While the cock with lively din
4609,L’ALLEGRO,"Scatters the rear of darkness thin,"
4610,L’ALLEGRO,"And to the stack, or the barn-door,"
4611,L’ALLEGRO,Stoutly struts his dames before:
4612,L’ALLEGRO,Oft listening how the hounds and horn
4613,L’ALLEGRO,"Cheerly rouse the slumbering morn,"
4614,L’ALLEGRO,"From the side of some hoar hill,"
4615,L’ALLEGRO,Through the high wood echoing shrill:
4616,L’ALLEGRO,"Sometime walking, not unseen,"
4617,L’ALLEGRO,"By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green,"
4618,L’ALLEGRO,Right against the eastern gate
4619,L’ALLEGRO,Where the great Sun begins his state
4620,L’ALLEGRO,"Robed in flames and amber light,"
4621,L’ALLEGRO,The clouds in thousand liveries dight;
4622,L’ALLEGRO,"While the ploughman, near at hand,"
4623,L’ALLEGRO,"Whistles o’er the furrowed land,"
4624,L’ALLEGRO,"And the milkmaid singeth blithe,"
4625,L’ALLEGRO,"And the mower whets his scythe,"
4626,L’ALLEGRO,And every shepherd tells his tale
4627,L’ALLEGRO,Under the hawthorn in the dale.
4628,L’ALLEGRO,Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures
4629,L’ALLEGRO,Whilst the landscape round it measures;
4630,L’ALLEGRO,"Russet lawns, and fallows gray,"
4631,L’ALLEGRO,Where the nibbling flocks do stray;
4632,L’ALLEGRO,"Mountains, on whose barren breast"
4633,L’ALLEGRO,The labouring clouds do often rest;
4634,L’ALLEGRO,"Meadows trim with daisies pied,"
4635,L’ALLEGRO,"Shallow brooks, and rivers wide;"
4636,L’ALLEGRO,Towers and battlements it sees
4637,L’ALLEGRO,"Bosomed high in tufted trees,"
4638,L’ALLEGRO,"Where perhaps some Beauty lies,"
4639,L’ALLEGRO,The cynosure of neighbouring eyes.
4640,L’ALLEGRO,"Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes"
4641,L’ALLEGRO,"From betwixt two aged oaks,"
4642,L’ALLEGRO,"Where Corydon and Thyrsis, met,"
4643,L’ALLEGRO,Are at their savoury dinner set
4644,L’ALLEGRO,"Of herbs, and other country messes,"
4645,L’ALLEGRO,Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses;
4646,L’ALLEGRO,"And then in haste her bower she leaves,"
4647,L’ALLEGRO,With Thestylis to bind the sheaves;
4648,L’ALLEGRO,"Or, if the earlier season lead,"
4649,L’ALLEGRO,To the tanned haycock in the mead.
4650,L’ALLEGRO,Sometimes with secure delight
4651,L’ALLEGRO,"The upland hamlets will invite,"
4652,L’ALLEGRO,"When the merry bells ring round,"
4653,L’ALLEGRO,And the jocund rebecks sound
4654,L’ALLEGRO,"To many a youth and many a maid,"
4655,L’ALLEGRO,Dancing in the chequered shade;
4656,L’ALLEGRO,And young and old come forth to play
4657,L’ALLEGRO,"On a sunshine holiday,"
4658,L’ALLEGRO,Till the live-long day-light fail:
4659,L’ALLEGRO,"Then to the spicy nut-brown ale,"
4660,L’ALLEGRO,"With stories told of many a feat,"
4661,L’ALLEGRO,How Faery Mab the junkets eat:—
4662,L’ALLEGRO,"She was pinched and pulled, she said;"
4663,L’ALLEGRO,And he by Friar’s lantern led;
4664,L’ALLEGRO,Tells how the grudging Goblin sweat
4665,L’ALLEGRO,"To earn his cream-bowl duly set,"
4666,L’ALLEGRO,"When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,"
4667,L’ALLEGRO,His shadowy flail hath threshed the corn
4668,L’ALLEGRO,That ten day-labourers could not end;
4669,L’ALLEGRO,"Then lies him down the lubber fiend,"
4670,L’ALLEGRO,"And, stretched out all the chimney’s length,"
4671,L’ALLEGRO,Basks at the fire his hairy strength;
4672,L’ALLEGRO,"And crop-full out of doors he flings,"
4673,L’ALLEGRO,Ere the first cock his matin rings.
4674,L’ALLEGRO,"Thus done the tales, to bed they creep,"
4675,L’ALLEGRO,By whispering winds soon lulled asleep.
4676,L’ALLEGRO,Towered cities please us then
4677,L’ALLEGRO,"And the busy hum of men,"
4678,L’ALLEGRO,"Where throngs of knights and barons bold,"
4679,L’ALLEGRO,"In weeds of peace, high triumphs hold,"
4680,L’ALLEGRO,"With store of ladies, whose bright eyes"
4681,L’ALLEGRO,"Rain influence, and judge the prize"
4682,L’ALLEGRO,"Of wit or arms, while both contend"
4683,L’ALLEGRO,"To win her grace, whom all commend."
4684,L’ALLEGRO,There let Hymen oft appear
4685,L’ALLEGRO,"In saffron robe, with taper clear,"
4686,L’ALLEGRO,"And pomp, and feast, and revelry,"
4687,L’ALLEGRO,"With mask, and antique pageantry;"
4688,L’ALLEGRO,Such sights as youthful poets dream
4689,L’ALLEGRO,On summer eves by haunted stream.
4690,L’ALLEGRO,"Then to the well-trod stage anon,"
4691,L’ALLEGRO,"If Jonson’s learned sock be on,"
4692,L’ALLEGRO,"Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy’s child,"
4693,L’ALLEGRO,Warble his native wood-notes wild.
4694,L’ALLEGRO,And ever against eating cares
4695,L’ALLEGRO,Lap me in soft Lydian airs
4696,L’ALLEGRO,"Married to immortal verse,"
4697,L’ALLEGRO,Such as the meeting soul may pierce
4698,L’ALLEGRO,"In notes, with many a winding bout"
4699,L’ALLEGRO,"Of linked sweetness long drawn out,"
4700,L’ALLEGRO,"With wanton heed and giddy cunning,"
4701,L’ALLEGRO,"The melting voice through mazes running,"
4702,L’ALLEGRO,Untwisting all the chains that tie
4703,L’ALLEGRO,The hidden soul of harmony;
4704,L’ALLEGRO,That Orpheus’ self may heave his head
4705,L’ALLEGRO,"From golden slumber, on a bed"
4706,L’ALLEGRO,"Of heaped Elysian flowers, and hear"
4707,L’ALLEGRO,Such strains as would have won the ear

4721,IL PENSEROSO,Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys!
4722,IL PENSEROSO,"Dwell in some idle brain,"
4723,IL PENSEROSO,And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess
4724,IL PENSEROSO,As thick and numberless
4725,IL PENSEROSO,"As the gay motes that people the sunbeams,"
4726,IL PENSEROSO,"Or likest hovering dreams,"
4727,IL PENSEROSO,The fickle pensioners of Morpheus’ train.

4729,IL PENSEROSO,"But hail, thou goddess sage and holy,"
4730,IL PENSEROSO,"Hail, divinest Melancholy!"
4731,IL PENSEROSO,Whose saintly visage is too bright

4738,IL PENSEROSO,To set her beauty’s praise above
4739,IL PENSEROSO,"The sea-nymphs, and their powers offended:"
4740,IL PENSEROSO,Yet thou art higher far descended:
4741,IL PENSEROSO,"Thee bright-haired Vesta, long of yore,"
4742,IL PENSEROSO,To solitary Saturn bore;
4743,IL PENSEROSO,His daughter she; in Saturn’s reign
4744,IL PENSEROSO,Such mixture was not held a stain:
4745,IL PENSEROSO,Oft in glimmering bowers and glades
4746,IL PENSEROSO,"He met her, and in secret shades"
4747,IL PENSEROSO,"Of woody Ida’s inmost grove,"
4748,IL PENSEROSO,While yet there was no fear of Jove.
4749,IL PENSEROSO,"Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure,"
4750,IL PENSEROSO,"Sober, steadfast, and demure,"
4751,IL PENSEROSO,All in a robe of darkest grain

4788,IL PENSEROSO,"Through the heaven’s wide pathless way,"
4789,IL PENSEROSO,"And oft, as if her head she bowed,"
4790,IL PENSEROSO,Stooping through a fleecy cloud.
4791,IL PENSEROSO,Oft on a plat of rising ground
4792,IL PENSEROSO,I hear the far-off curfew sound
4793,IL PENSEROSO,"Over some wide-watered shore,"
4794,IL PENSEROSO,Swinging slow with sullen roar;
4795,IL PENSEROSO,"Or, if the air will not permit,"
4796,IL PENSEROSO,"Some still, removed place will fit,"
4797,IL PENSEROSO,Where glowing embers through the room

4799,IL PENSEROSO,"Far from all resort of mirth,"
4800,IL PENSEROSO,"Save the cricket on the hearth,"
4801,IL PENSEROSO,Or the bellman’s drowsy charm
4802,IL PENSEROSO,To bless the doors from nightly harm.
4803,IL PENSEROSO,Or let my lamp at midnight hour

4845,IL PENSEROSO,"Or ushered with a shower still,"
4846,IL PENSEROSO,"When the gust hath blown his fill,"
4847,IL PENSEROSO,Ending on the rustling leaves
4848,IL PENSEROSO,With minute drops from off the eaves.

4850,IL PENSEROSO,"His flaring beams, me, goddess, bring"
4851,IL PENSEROSO,"To arched walks of twilight groves,"
4852,IL PENSEROSO,"And shadows brown, that Sylvan loves,"
4853,IL PENSEROSO,"Of pine, or monumental oak,"
4854,IL PENSEROSO,"Where the rude axe, with heaved stroke,"
4855,IL PENSEROSO,"Was never heard the nymphs to daunt,"

4862,IL PENSEROSO,"And the waters murmuring,"
4863,IL PENSEROSO,With such consort as they keep
4864,IL PENSEROSO,Entice the dewy-feathered Sleep;
4865,IL PENSEROSO,And let some strange mysterious dream
4866,IL PENSEROSO,Wave at his wings in airy stream
4867,IL PENSEROSO,"Of lively portraiture displayed,"
4868,IL PENSEROSO,Softly on my eyelids laid:
4869,IL PENSEROSO,"And, as I wake, sweet music breathe"
4870,IL PENSEROSO,"Above, about, or underneath,"
4871,IL PENSEROSO,"Sent by some Spirit to mortals good,"

4876,IL PENSEROSO,"With antique pillars massy proof,"
4877,IL PENSEROSO,And storied windows richly dight
4878,IL PENSEROSO,Casting a dim religious light.
4879,IL PENSEROSO,There let the pealing organ blow
4880,IL PENSEROSO,To the full-voiced quire below

4889,IL PENSEROSO,"Of every star that heaven doth shew,"

4973,LYCIDAS,And strictly meditate the thankless Muse?
4974,LYCIDAS,"Were it not better done, as others use,"
4975,LYCIDAS,"To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,"
4976,LYCIDAS,Or with the tangles of Neaera’s hair?
4977,LYCIDAS,Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
4978,LYCIDAS,(That last infirmity of noble mind)
4979,LYCIDAS,"To scorn delights, and live laborious days;"
4980,LYCIDAS,"But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,"

4999,LYCIDAS,"He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,"
5000,LYCIDAS,What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?
5001,LYCIDAS,And questioned every gust of rugged wings
5002,LYCIDAS,That blows from off each beaked promontory.
5003,LYCIDAS,They knew not of his story;
5004,LYCIDAS,"And sage Hippotades their answer brings,"
5005,LYCIDAS,That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed;
5006,LYCIDAS,"The air was calm, and on the level brine"
5007,LYCIDAS,Sleek Panope with all her sisters played.
5008,LYCIDAS,It was that fatal and perfidious bark

5017,LYCIDAS,"Last came, and last did go"
5018,LYCIDAS,The Pilot of the Galilean lake;

5025,LYCIDAS,Of other care they little reckoning make
5026,LYCIDAS,"Than how to scramble at the shearers’ feast,"
5027,LYCIDAS,And shove away the worthy bidden guest.
5028,LYCIDAS,Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold
5029,LYCIDAS,"A sheep-hook, or have learned aught else the least"
5030,LYCIDAS,That to the faithful herdman’s art belongs!
5031,LYCIDAS,What recks it them?  What need they?  They are sped;
5032,LYCIDAS,"And when they list, their lean and flashy songs"
5033,LYCIDAS,Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;
5034,LYCIDAS,"The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,"
5035,LYCIDAS,"But, swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw,"
5036,LYCIDAS,"Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread:"
5037,LYCIDAS,Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
5038,LYCIDAS,"Daily devours apace, and nothing said:"

5042,LYCIDAS,"Return, Alpheus; the dread voice is past"

5044,LYCIDAS,"And call the vales, and bid them hither cast"
5045,LYCIDAS,Their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues.
5046,LYCIDAS,"Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use"
5047,LYCIDAS,"Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks"
5048,LYCIDAS,On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks;
5049,LYCIDAS,Throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes
5050,LYCIDAS,That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers
5051,LYCIDAS,And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.
5052,LYCIDAS,"Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,"
5053,LYCIDAS,"The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,"
5054,LYCIDAS,"The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet,"
5055,LYCIDAS,"The glowing violet,"
5056,LYCIDAS,"The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,"
5057,LYCIDAS,"With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,"
5058,LYCIDAS,And every flower that sad embroidery wears:
5059,LYCIDAS,"Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed,"
5060,LYCIDAS,"And daffadillies fill their cups with tears,"
5061,LYCIDAS,To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies.
5062,LYCIDAS,"For so to interpose a little ease,"
5063,LYCIDAS,Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise:—
5064,LYCIDAS,Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
5065,LYCIDAS,"Wash far away, where’er thy bones are hurled,"
5066,LYCIDAS,"Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,"
5067,LYCIDAS,"Where thou perhaps, under the whelming tide,"
5068,LYCIDAS,Visitest the bottom of the monstrous world;
5069,LYCIDAS,"Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied,"
5070,LYCIDAS,"Sleep’st by the fable of Bellerus old,"
5071,LYCIDAS,Where the great Vision of the guarded mount
5072,LYCIDAS,Looks toward Namancos and Bayona’s hold;
5073,LYCIDAS,"Look homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth:"
5074,LYCIDAS,"And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth!"
5075,LYCIDAS,
5076,LYCIDAS,"Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,"
5077,LYCIDAS,"For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,"
5078,LYCIDAS,Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor:
5079,LYCIDAS,"So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,"
5080,LYCIDAS,And yet anon repairs his drooping head
5081,LYCIDAS,"And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore"
5082,LYCIDAS,Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:
5083,LYCIDAS,"So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high"
5084,LYCIDAS,Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves;
5085,LYCIDAS,"Where, other groves and other streams along,"
5086,LYCIDAS,"With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,"
5087,LYCIDAS,And hears the unexpressive nuptial song
5088,LYCIDAS,In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love.
5089,LYCIDAS,"There entertain him all the Saints above,"
5090,LYCIDAS,"In solemn troops, and sweet societies,"
5091,LYCIDAS,"That sing, and singing in their glory move,"
5092,LYCIDAS,And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.
5093,LYCIDAS,"Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;"

5946,MUSIC’S DUEL,MUSIC’S DUEL
5947,MUSIC’S DUEL,
5948,MUSIC’S DUEL,
5949,MUSIC’S DUEL,NOW westward Sol had spent the richest beams
5950,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Of noon’s high glory, when, hard by the streams"
5951,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Of Tiber, on the scene of a green plat,"
5952,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Under protection of an oak, there sat"
5953,MUSIC’S DUEL,A sweet lute’s master: in whose gentle airs
5954,MUSIC’S DUEL,"He lost the day’s heat, and his own hot cares."
5955,MUSIC’S DUEL,Close in the covert of the leaves there stood
5956,MUSIC’S DUEL,"A nightingale, come from the neighbouring wood:—"
5957,MUSIC’S DUEL,"The sweet inhabitant of each glad tree,"
5958,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Their muse, their Syren, harmless Syren she,—"
5959,MUSIC’S DUEL,"There stood she list’ning, and did entertain"
5960,MUSIC’S DUEL,"The music’s soft report, and mould the same"
5961,MUSIC’S DUEL,"In her own murmurs, that whatever mood"
5962,MUSIC’S DUEL,"His curious fingers lent, her voice made good."
5963,MUSIC’S DUEL,"The man perceived his rival, and her art;"
5964,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Disposed to give the light-foot lady sport,"
5965,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Awakes his lute, and ’gainst the fight to come"
5966,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Informs it, in a sweet _præludium_"
5967,MUSIC’S DUEL,Of closer strains; and ere the war begin
5968,MUSIC’S DUEL,"He slightly skirmishes on every string,"
5969,MUSIC’S DUEL,Charged with a flying touch; and straightway she
5970,MUSIC’S DUEL,Carves out her dainty voice as readily
5971,MUSIC’S DUEL,Into a thousand sweet distinguished tones;
5972,MUSIC’S DUEL,And reckons up in soft divisions
5973,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Quick volumes of wild notes, to let him know"
5974,MUSIC’S DUEL,By that shrill taste she could do something too.
5975,MUSIC’S DUEL,His nimble hand’s instinct then taught each string
5976,MUSIC’S DUEL,A cap’ring cheerfulness; and made them sing
5977,MUSIC’S DUEL,To their own dance; now negligently rash
5978,MUSIC’S DUEL,"He throws his arm, and with a long-drawn dash"
5979,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Blends all together, then distinctly trips"
5980,MUSIC’S DUEL,"From this to that, then, quick returning, skips"
5981,MUSIC’S DUEL,"And snatches this again, and pauses there."
5982,MUSIC’S DUEL,"She measures every measure, everywhere"
5983,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Meets art with art; sometimes, as if in doubt—"
5984,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Not perfect yet, and fearing to be out—"
5985,MUSIC’S DUEL,Trails her plain ditty in one long-spun note
5986,MUSIC’S DUEL,Through the sleek passage of her open throat:
5987,MUSIC’S DUEL,A clear unwrinkled song; then doth she point it
5988,MUSIC’S DUEL,"With tender accents, and severely joint it"
5989,MUSIC’S DUEL,"By short diminutives, that, being reared"
5990,MUSIC’S DUEL,"In controverting warbles evenly shared,"
5991,MUSIC’S DUEL,"With her sweet sell she wrangles; he, amazed"
5992,MUSIC’S DUEL,That from so small a channel should be raised
5993,MUSIC’S DUEL,The torrent of a voice whose melody
5994,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Could melt into such sweet variety,"
5995,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Strains higher yet, that, tickled with rare art,"
5996,MUSIC’S DUEL,The tattling strings—each breathing in his part—
5997,MUSIC’S DUEL,Most kindly do fall out; the grumbling bass
5998,MUSIC’S DUEL,In surly groans disdains the treble’s grace;
5999,MUSIC’S DUEL,"The high-perched treble chirps at this, and chides"
6000,MUSIC’S DUEL,Until his finger—moderator—hides
6001,MUSIC’S DUEL,"And closes the sweet quarrel, rousing all,"
6002,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Hoarse, shrill, at once: as when the trumpets call"
6003,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Hot Mars to th’ harvest of death’s field, and woo"
6004,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Men’s hearts into their hands; this lesson, too,"
6005,MUSIC’S DUEL,"She gives him back, her supple breast thrills out"
6006,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Sharp airs, and staggers in a warbling doubt"
6007,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Of dallying sweetness, hovers o’er her skill,"
6008,MUSIC’S DUEL,"And folds in waved notes, with a trembling bill,"
6009,MUSIC’S DUEL,The pliant series of her slippery song;
6010,MUSIC’S DUEL,Then starts she suddenly into a throng
6011,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Of short thick sobs, whose thund’ring volleys float"
6012,MUSIC’S DUEL,And roll themselves over her lubric throat
6013,MUSIC’S DUEL,"In panting murmurs, ’stilled out of her breast,"
6014,MUSIC’S DUEL,"That ever-bubbling spring, the sugared nest"
6015,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Of her delicious soul, that there does lie"
6016,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Bathing in streams of liquid melody,—"
6017,MUSIC’S DUEL,Music’s best seed-plot; when in ripened ears
6018,MUSIC’S DUEL,A golden-headed harvest fairly rears
6019,MUSIC’S DUEL,"His honey-dropping tops, ploughed by her breath,"
6020,MUSIC’S DUEL,Which there reciprocally laboureth.
6021,MUSIC’S DUEL,In that sweet soil it seems a holy quire
6022,MUSIC’S DUEL,Founded to th’ name of great Apollo’s lyre;
6023,MUSIC’S DUEL,Whose silver roof rings with the sprightly notes
6024,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Of sweet-lipped angel-imps, that swill their throats"
6025,MUSIC’S DUEL,In cream of morning Helicon; and then
6026,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Prefer soft anthems to the ears of men,"
6027,MUSIC’S DUEL,"To woo them from their beds, still murmuring"
6028,MUSIC’S DUEL,That men can sleep while they their matins sing;—
6029,MUSIC’S DUEL,Most divine service! whose so early lay
6030,MUSIC’S DUEL,Prevents the eyelids of the blushing day.
6031,MUSIC’S DUEL,There might you hear her kindle her soft voice
6032,MUSIC’S DUEL,"In the close murmur of a sparkling noise,"
6033,MUSIC’S DUEL,And lay the ground-work of her hopeful song;
6034,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Still keeping in the forward stream so long,"
6035,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Till a sweet whirlwind, striving to get out,"
6036,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Heaves her soft bosom, wanders round about,"
6037,MUSIC’S DUEL,And makes a pretty earthquake in her breast;
6038,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Till the fledged notes at length forsake their nest,"
6039,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Fluttering in wanton shoals, and to the sky,"
6040,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Winged with their own wild echos, pratt’ling fly."
6041,MUSIC’S DUEL,"She opes the floodgate, and lets loose a tide"
6042,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Of streaming sweetness, which in state doth ride"
6043,MUSIC’S DUEL,"On the waved back of every swelling strain,"
6044,MUSIC’S DUEL,Rising and falling in a pompous train;
6045,MUSIC’S DUEL,And while she thus discharges a shrill peal
6046,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Of flashing airs, she qualifies their zeal"
6047,MUSIC’S DUEL,With the cool epode of a graver note;
6048,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Thus high, thus low, as if her silver throat"
6049,MUSIC’S DUEL,Would reach the brazen voice of war’s hoarse bird;
6050,MUSIC’S DUEL,Her little soul is ravished; and so poured
6051,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Into loose ecstasies, that she is placed"
6052,MUSIC’S DUEL,Above herself—music’s enthusiast!
6053,MUSIC’S DUEL,Shame now and anger mixed a double stain
6054,MUSIC’S DUEL,"In the musician’s face: Yet once again,"
6055,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Mistress, I come.  Now reach a strain, my lute,"
6056,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Above her mock, or be for ever mute;"
6057,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Or tune a song of victory to me,"
6058,MUSIC’S DUEL,Or to thyself sing thine own obsequy!
6059,MUSIC’S DUEL,"So said, his hands sprightly as fire he flings,"
6060,MUSIC’S DUEL,And with a quivering coyness tastes the strings:
6061,MUSIC’S DUEL,"The sweet-lipped sisters, musically frighted,"
6062,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Singing their fears, are fearfully delighted:"
6063,MUSIC’S DUEL,Trembling as when Apollo’s golden hairs
6064,MUSIC’S DUEL,Are fanned and frizzled in the wanton airs
6065,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Of his own breath, which, married to his lyre,"

6067,MUSIC’S DUEL,"From this to that, from that to this, he flies,"

6070,MUSIC’S DUEL,"His fingers struggle with the vocal threads,"
6071,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Following those little rills, he sinks into"

6073,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Those parts of sweetness which with nectar drop,"
6074,MUSIC’S DUEL,Softer than that which pants in Hebe’s cup:
6075,MUSIC’S DUEL,The humorous strings expound his learned touch
6076,MUSIC’S DUEL,By various glosses; now they seem to grutch
6077,MUSIC’S DUEL,"And murmur in a buzzing din, then gingle"

6079,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Every smooth turn, every delicious stroke,"

6085,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Whose flourish, meteor-like, doth curl the air"
6086,MUSIC’S DUEL,With flash of high-born fancies; here and there
6087,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Dancing in lofty measures, and anon"

6089,MUSIC’S DUEL,"Whose trembling murmurs, melting in wild airs,"

6124,THE FLAMING HEART,"_Teresa_, _as she is usually expressed with_"
6125,THE FLAMING HEART,_a Seraphim beside her_
6126,THE FLAMING HEART,
6127,THE FLAMING HEART,WELL-MEANING readers! you that come as friends
6128,THE FLAMING HEART,"And catch the precious name this piece pretends,"
6129,THE FLAMING HEART,Make not too much haste t’ admire
6130,THE FLAMING HEART,That fair-cheeked fallacy of fire.
6131,THE FLAMING HEART,"That is a seraphim, they say,"
6132,THE FLAMING HEART,And this the great Teresia.
6133,THE FLAMING HEART,"Readers, be ruled by me, and make"
6134,THE FLAMING HEART,Here a well-placed and wise mistake;
6135,THE FLAMING HEART,"You must transpose the picture quite,"
6136,THE FLAMING HEART,And spell it wrong to read it right;
6137,THE FLAMING HEART,"Read Him for Her, and Her for Him,"
6138,THE FLAMING HEART,And call the saint the seraphim.
6139,THE FLAMING HEART,"Painter, what didst thou understand"
6140,THE FLAMING HEART,To put her dart into his hand?
6141,THE FLAMING HEART,"See, even the years and size of him"
6142,THE FLAMING HEART,Shows this the mother seraphim.
6143,THE FLAMING HEART,"This is the mistress flame, and duteous he"
6144,THE FLAMING HEART,"Her happy fireworks, here, comes down to see:"
6145,THE FLAMING HEART,"O, most poor-spirited of men!"
6146,THE FLAMING HEART,"Had thy cold pencil kissed her pen,"
6147,THE FLAMING HEART,Thou couldst not so unkindly err
6148,THE FLAMING HEART,To show us this faint shade for her.
6149,THE FLAMING HEART,"Why, man, this speaks pure mortal frame,"
6150,THE FLAMING HEART,And mocks with female frost love’s manly flame;
6151,THE FLAMING HEART,One would suspect thou meant’st to paint
6152,THE FLAMING HEART,"Some weak, inferior woman Saint."
6153,THE FLAMING HEART,"But, had thy pale-faced purple took"
6154,THE FLAMING HEART,"Fire from the burning cheeks of that bright book,"
6155,THE FLAMING HEART,Thou wouldst on her have heaped up all
6156,THE FLAMING HEART,That could be found seraphical;
6157,THE FLAMING HEART,"Whate’er this youth of fire wears fair,"
6158,THE FLAMING HEART,"Rosy fingers, radiant hair,"
6159,THE FLAMING HEART,"Glowing cheek, and glist’ring wings,"
6160,THE FLAMING HEART,All those fair and flagrant things;
6161,THE FLAMING HEART,"But, before all, that fiery dart"
6162,THE FLAMING HEART,Had filled the hand of this great heart.
6163,THE FLAMING HEART,"Do, then, as equal right requires,"
6164,THE FLAMING HEART,"Since his the blushes be, and hers the fires,"
6165,THE FLAMING HEART,"Resume and rectify thy rude design,"
6166,THE FLAMING HEART,Undress thy seraphim into mine;
6167,THE FLAMING HEART,"Redeem this injury of thy art,"
6168,THE FLAMING HEART,"Give him the veil, give her the dart."
6169,THE FLAMING HEART,"Give him the veil, that he may cover"
6170,THE FLAMING HEART,"The red cheeks of a rivalled lover,"
6171,THE FLAMING HEART,Ashamed that our world now can show
6172,THE FLAMING HEART,Nests of new Seraphims here below.
6173,THE FLAMING HEART,"Give her the dart, for it is she,"
6174,THE FLAMING HEART,"Fair youth, shoots both thy shaft and thee;"
6175,THE FLAMING HEART,"Say, all ye wise and well-pierced hearts"
6176,THE FLAMING HEART,"That live and die amidst her darts,"
6177,THE FLAMING HEART,What is’t your tasteful spirits do prove
6178,THE FLAMING HEART,In that rare life of her and love?
6179,THE FLAMING HEART,Say and bear witness.  Sends she not
6180,THE FLAMING HEART,A seraphim at every shot?
6181,THE FLAMING HEART,What magazines of immortal arms there shine!
6182,THE FLAMING HEART,Heav’n’s great artillery in each love-spun line!
6183,THE FLAMING HEART,"Give, then, the dart to her who gives the flame,"
6184,THE FLAMING HEART,Give him the veil who gives the shame.
6185,THE FLAMING HEART,But if it be the frequent fate
6186,THE FLAMING HEART,"Of worst faults to be fortunate,"
6187,THE FLAMING HEART,"If all’s prescription, and proud wrong"
6188,THE FLAMING HEART,"Hearkens not to an humble song,"
6189,THE FLAMING HEART,"For all the gallantry of him,"
6190,THE FLAMING HEART,Give me the suff’ring seraphim.
6191,THE FLAMING HEART,"His be the bravery of those bright things,"
6192,THE FLAMING HEART,"The glowing cheeks, the glistering wings,"
6193,THE FLAMING HEART,"The rosy hand, the radiant dart;"
6194,THE FLAMING HEART,Leave her alone the flaming heart.
6195,THE FLAMING HEART,"Leave her that, and thou shalt leave her"
6196,THE FLAMING HEART,"Not one loose shaft, but Love’s whole quiver."
6197,THE FLAMING HEART,For in Love’s field was never found
6198,THE FLAMING HEART,A nobler weapon than a wound.
6199,THE FLAMING HEART,"Love’s passives are his activ’st part,"
6200,THE FLAMING HEART,The wounded is the wounding heart.
6201,THE FLAMING HEART,"O, heart! the equal poise of Love’s both parts,"
6202,THE FLAMING HEART,"Big alike with wounds and darts,"
6203,THE FLAMING HEART,"Live in these conquering leaves, live all the same,"
6204,THE FLAMING HEART,And walk through all tongues one triumphant flame!
6205,THE FLAMING HEART,"Live here, great heart, and love, and die, and kill,"
6206,THE FLAMING HEART,"And bleed, and wound, and yield, and conquer still."
6207,THE FLAMING HEART,"Let this immortal Life, where’er it comes,"
6208,THE FLAMING HEART,Walk in the crowd of loves and martyrdoms.
6209,THE FLAMING HEART,"Let mystic deaths wait on’t, and wise souls be"
6210,THE FLAMING HEART,The love-slain witnesses of this life of thee.
6211,THE FLAMING HEART,"O, sweet incendiary! show here thy art"
6212,THE FLAMING HEART,"Upon this carcass of a hard, cold heart;"
6213,THE FLAMING HEART,"Let all thy scattered shafts of light, that play"
6214,THE FLAMING HEART,"Among the leaves of thy large books of day,"
6215,THE FLAMING HEART,"Combined against this breast, at once break in"
6216,THE FLAMING HEART,And take away from me myself and sin;
6217,THE FLAMING HEART,"This gracious robbery shall thy bounty be,"
6218,THE FLAMING HEART,And my best fortunes such fair spoils of me.
6219,THE FLAMING HEART,"O, thou undaunted daughter of desires!"
6220,THE FLAMING HEART,"By all thy dower of lights and fires,"
6221,THE FLAMING HEART,"By all the eagle in thee, all the dove,"
6222,THE FLAMING HEART,"By all thy lives and deaths of love,"
6223,THE FLAMING HEART,"By thy large draughts of intellectual day,"
6224,THE FLAMING HEART,And by thy thirst of love more large than they;
6225,THE FLAMING HEART,"By all thy brim-filled bowls of fierce desire,"
6226,THE FLAMING HEART,"By thy last morning’s draught of liquid fire,"
6227,THE FLAMING HEART,By the full kingdom of that final kiss
6228,THE FLAMING HEART,"That seized thy parting soul, and sealed thee His;"
6229,THE FLAMING HEART,"By all the heav’ns thou hast in Him,"
6230,THE FLAMING HEART,Fair sister of the seraphim!
6231,THE FLAMING HEART,"By all of Him we have in thee,"
6232,THE FLAMING HEART,Leave nothing of myself in me:
6233,THE FLAMING HEART,Let me so read thy life that I
6234,THE FLAMING HEART,Unto all life of mine may die.

6876,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
6877,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Thenceforth I set myself to play

6879,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"With this; and, very well content,"
6880,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Could so mine idle life have spent;

6882,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Of foot and heart, and did invite"

6897,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,With sweetest milk and sugar first

6899,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And as it grew, so every day"
6900,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It waxed more white and sweet than they—
6901,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It had so sweet a breath! and oft

6903,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And white—shall I say?—than my hand,"
6904,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Nay, any lady’s of the land!"
6905,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
6906,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It is a wondrous thing how fleet
6907,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,’Twas on those little silver feet:
6908,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,With what a pretty skipping grace
6909,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It oft would challenge me the race:—
6910,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And when ’t had left me far away
6911,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"’Twould stay, and run again, and stay;"
6912,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"For it was nimbler much than hinds,"
6913,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And trod as if on the four winds.
6914,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
6915,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"I have a garden of my own,"
6916,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,But so with roses overgrown
6917,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And lilies, that you would it guess"
6918,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,To be a little wilderness:
6919,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And all the spring-time of the year
6920,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It only loved to be there.
6921,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Among the beds of lilies I
6922,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Have sought it oft, where it should lie;"
6923,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Yet could not, till itself would rise,"
6924,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Find it, although before mine eyes."
6925,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
6926,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,For in the flaxen lilies’ shade
6927,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,It like a bank of lilies laid.
6928,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Upon the roses it would feed,"
6929,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Until its lips e’en seemed to bleed,"
6930,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"And then to me ’twould boldly trip,"
6931,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And print those roses on my lip.
6932,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,But all its chief delight was still
6933,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"On roses thus itself to fill,"
6934,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And its pure virgin limbs to fold
6935,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,In whitest sheets of lilies cold:—
6936,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Had it lived long, it would have been"
6937,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Lilies without—roses within.
6938,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
6939,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,O help!  O help!  I see it faint
6940,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,And die as calmly as a saint!
6941,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,See how it weeps! the tears do come
6942,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Sad, slowly, dropping like a gum."
6943,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,So weeps the wounded balsam; so
6944,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,The holy frankincense doth flow;
6945,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,The brotherless Heliades
6946,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Melt in such amber tears as these.
6947,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
6948,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,I in a golden vial will
6949,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Keep these two crystal tears, and fill"
6950,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"It, till it doth o’erflow, with mine,"
6951,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Then place it in Diana’s shrine.
6952,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,
6953,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Now my sweet fawn is vanished to
6954,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Whither the swans and turtles go;
6955,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,In fair Elysium to endure
6956,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,With milk-white lambs and ermines pure.
6957,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"O, do not run too fast, for I"
6958,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Will but bespeak thy grave, and die."
6959,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,First my unhappy statue shall
6960,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Be cut in marble; and withal
6961,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Let it be weeping too; but there
6962,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,The engraver sure his art may spare;
6963,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,For I so truly thee bemoan
6964,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"That I shall weep though I be stone,"
6965,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,"Until my tears, still dropping, wear"

6968,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,Of purest alabaster made;
6969,THE NYMPH COMPLAINING OF THE DEATH OF HER FAWN,For I would have thine image be

7023,THE GARDEN,
7024,THE GARDEN,HOW vainly men themselves amaze
7025,THE GARDEN,"To win the palm, the oak, or bays,"
7026,THE GARDEN,And their incessant labours see
7027,THE GARDEN,"Crowned from some single herb or tree,"
7028,THE GARDEN,Whose short and narrow-verged shade
7029,THE GARDEN,Does prudently their toils upbraid;
7030,THE GARDEN,While all the flowers and trees do close
7031,THE GARDEN,To weave the garlands of Repose.
7032,THE GARDEN,
7033,THE GARDEN,"Fair Quiet, have I found thee here,"
7034,THE GARDEN,And Innocence thy sister dear?

7036,THE GARDEN,In busy companies of men:
7037,THE GARDEN,"Your sacred plants, if here below,"
7038,THE GARDEN,Only among the plants will grow:

7040,THE GARDEN,To this delicious solitude.
7041,THE GARDEN,
7042,THE GARDEN,No white nor red was ever seen
7043,THE GARDEN,So amorous as this lovely green.
7044,THE GARDEN,"Fond lovers, cruel as their flame,"
7045,THE GARDEN,Cut in these trees their mistress’ name:

7047,THE GARDEN,How far these beauties her exceed!

7058,THE GARDEN,"Not as a nymph, but for a reed."
7059,THE GARDEN,
7060,THE GARDEN,What wondrous life is this I lead!
7061,THE GARDEN,Ripe apples drop about my head;
7062,THE GARDEN,The luscious clusters of the vine
7063,THE GARDEN,Upon my mouth do crush their wine;
7064,THE GARDEN,The nectarine and curious peach
7065,THE GARDEN,Into my hands themselves do reach;
7066,THE GARDEN,"Stumbling on melons, as I pass,"
7067,THE GARDEN,"Ensnared with flowers, I fall on grass."
7068,THE GARDEN,
7069,THE GARDEN,"Meanwhile the mind, from pleasure less,"
7070,THE GARDEN,Withdraws into its happiness;
7071,THE GARDEN,"The mind, that ocean where each kind"

7073,THE GARDEN,"Yet it creates, transcending these,"
7074,THE GARDEN,Far other worlds and other seas;
7075,THE GARDEN,Annihilating all that’s made
7076,THE GARDEN,To a green thought in a green shade.
7077,THE GARDEN,
7078,THE GARDEN,Here at the fountain’s sliding foot
7079,THE GARDEN,"Or at some fruit-tree’s mossy root,"

7081,THE GARDEN,My soul into the boughs does glide;

7084,THE GARDEN,"And, till prepared for longer flight,"
7085,THE GARDEN,Waves in its plumes the various light.

7088,THE GARDEN,While man there walked without a mate:
7089,THE GARDEN,"After a place so pure and sweet,"
7090,THE GARDEN,What other help could yet be meet!
7091,THE GARDEN,But ’twas beyond a mortal’s share
7092,THE GARDEN,To wander solitary there:
7093,THE GARDEN,"Two paradises ’twere in one,"
7094,THE GARDEN,To live in Paradise alone.
7095,THE GARDEN,
7096,THE GARDEN,How well the skilful gardener drew
7097,THE GARDEN,Of flowers and herbs this dial new!
7098,THE GARDEN,"Where, from above, the milder sun"
7099,THE GARDEN,Does through a fragrant zodiac run:
7100,THE GARDEN,"And, as it works, th’ industrious bee"
7101,THE GARDEN,Computes its time as well as we.

7103,THE GARDEN,"Be reckoned, but with herbs and flowers?"

7120,THE DAWNING,"Break at midnight,"
7121,THE DAWNING,When either sleep or some dark pleasure
7122,THE DAWNING,Possesseth mad man without measure?
7123,THE DAWNING,"Or shall these early, fragrant hours"
7124,THE DAWNING,Unlock Thy bowers?
7125,THE DAWNING,And with their blush of light descry
7126,THE DAWNING,Thy locks crowned with eternity?
7127,THE DAWNING,Indeed it is the only time

7225,CORRUPTION,SURE it was so.  Man in those early days
7226,CORRUPTION,Was not all stone and earth;
7227,CORRUPTION,"He shined a little, and by those weak rays"
7228,CORRUPTION,Had some glimpse of his birth.
7229,CORRUPTION,"He saw heaven o’er his head, and knew from whence"
7230,CORRUPTION,"He came, condemned, hither;"
7231,CORRUPTION,"And, as first-love draws strongest, so from hence"
7232,CORRUPTION,His mind sure progressed thither.
7233,CORRUPTION,Things here were strange unto him; sweat and till;
7234,CORRUPTION,All was a thorn or weed;
7235,CORRUPTION,"Nor did those last, but—like himself—died still"
7236,CORRUPTION,As soon as they did seed;
7237,CORRUPTION,"They seemed to quarrel with him; for that act,"
7238,CORRUPTION,"That fell him, foiled them all;"
7239,CORRUPTION,"He drew the curse upon the world, and cracked"
7240,CORRUPTION,The whole frame with his fall.
7241,CORRUPTION,"This made him long for home, as loth to stay"
7242,CORRUPTION,With murmurers and foes;
7243,CORRUPTION,"He sighed for Eden, and would often say,"
7244,CORRUPTION,‘Ah! what bright days were those!’
7245,CORRUPTION,Nor was heaven cold unto him; for each day
7246,CORRUPTION,The valley or the mountain
7247,CORRUPTION,"Afforded visits, and still Paradise lay"
7248,CORRUPTION,In some green shade or fountain.
7249,CORRUPTION,"Angels lay leiger here; each bush, and cell,"
7250,CORRUPTION,Each oak and highway knew them:
7251,CORRUPTION,"Walk but the fields, or sit down at some well,"
7252,CORRUPTION,And he was sure to view them.
7253,CORRUPTION,Almighty Love! where art Thou now? mad man
7254,CORRUPTION,Sits down and freezeth on;
7255,CORRUPTION,"He raves, and swears to stir nor fire, nor fan,"
7256,CORRUPTION,But bids the thread be spun.
7257,CORRUPTION,I see Thy curtains are close-drawn; Thy bow
7258,CORRUPTION,"Looks dim, too, in the cloud;"
7259,CORRUPTION,"Sin triumphs still, and man is sunk below"
7260,CORRUPTION,"The centre, and his shroud."
7261,CORRUPTION,All’s in deep sleep and night: thick darkness lies
7262,CORRUPTION,And hatcheth o’er Thy people—
7263,CORRUPTION,But hark! what trumpet’s that? what angel cries

7290,THE NIGHT,The fulness of the Deity?
7291,THE NIGHT,
7292,THE NIGHT,"No mercy-seat of gold,"
7293,THE NIGHT,"No dead and dusty cherub nor carved stone,"
7294,THE NIGHT,But His own living works did my Lord hold
7295,THE NIGHT,And lodge alone;

7302,THE NIGHT,Which none disturb!

7306,THE NIGHT,"God’s silent, searching flight;"
7307,THE NIGHT,"When my Lord’s head is filled with dew, and all"

7309,THE NIGHT,"His still, soft call;"

7312,THE NIGHT,
7313,THE NIGHT,"Were my loud, evil days"
7314,THE NIGHT,"Calm and unhaunted as is thy dark tent,"
7315,THE NIGHT,Whose peace but by some angel’s wing or voice
7316,THE NIGHT,Is seldom rent;
7317,THE NIGHT,Then I in heaven all the long year
7318,THE NIGHT,"Would keep, and never wander here."

7375,THE RETREAT,"O how I long to travel back,"
7376,THE RETREAT,And tread again that ancient track!
7377,THE RETREAT,That I might once more reach that plain
7378,THE RETREAT,Where first I left my glorious train;
7379,THE RETREAT,From whence the enlightened spirit sees
7380,THE RETREAT,That shady city of palm-trees.
7381,THE RETREAT,But ah! my soul with too much stay
7382,THE RETREAT,"Is drunk, and staggers in the way!"
7383,THE RETREAT,"Some men a forward motion love,"

7991,ODE,"If by traduction came thy mind,"

7995,ODE,So wert thou born into the tuneful strain

7997,ODE,But if thy pre-existing soul

8020,ODE,"On thy sweet mouth distilled their golden dew,"

8033,ODE,This lubric and adulterate age
8034,ODE,"(Nay, added fat pollutions of our own),"

8042,ODE,For Nature did that want supply:
8043,ODE,"So rich in treasures of her own,"
8044,ODE,She might our boasted stores defy:
8045,ODE,Such noble vigour did her verse adorn
8046,ODE,"That it seemed borrowed, where ’twas only born."
8047,ODE,"Her morals, too, were in her bosom bred,"
8048,ODE,"By great examples daily fed,"
8049,ODE,"What in the best of books, her father’s life, she read."
8050,ODE,And to be read herself she need not fear;
8051,ODE,"Each test and every light her muse will bear,"
8052,ODE,Though Epictetus with his lamp were there.
8053,ODE,Even love (for love sometimes her muse expressed)
8054,ODE,"Was but a lambent flame which played about her breast,"
8055,ODE,Light as the vapours of a morning dream;
8056,ODE,"So cold herself, while she such warmth expressed,"

8221,ELEGY,"There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,"

9027,ELEGIAC STANZAS,_Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle in a Storm_
9028,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9029,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"I WAS thy neighbour once, thou rugged pile!"
9030,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee:
9031,ELEGIAC STANZAS,I saw thee every day; and all the while
9032,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea.
9033,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9034,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"So pure the sky, so quiet was the air!"
9035,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"So like, so very like, was day to day!"
9036,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Whene’er I looked, thy image still was there;"
9037,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"It trembled, but it never passed away."
9038,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9039,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"How perfect was the calm!  It seemed no sleep,"
9040,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"No mood, which season takes away or brings:"
9041,ELEGIAC STANZAS,I could have fancied that the mighty Deep
9042,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Was even the gentlest of all gentle things.
9043,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9044,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Ah! then—if mine had been the painter’s hand
9045,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"To express what then I saw; and add the gleam,"
9046,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"The light that never was on sea or land,"
9047,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"The consecration, and the Poet’s dream,—"
9048,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9049,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"I would have planted thee, thou hoary pile,"
9050,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Amid a world how different from this!
9051,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;
9052,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss."
9053,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9054,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine
9055,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Of peaceful years: a chronicle of heaven;—
9056,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine
9057,ELEGIAC STANZAS,The very sweetest had to thee been given.
9058,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9059,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"A picture had it been of lasting ease,"
9060,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Elysian quiet, without toil or strife;"
9061,ELEGIAC STANZAS,No motion but the moving tide; a breeze;
9062,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Or merely silent Nature’s breathing life.
9063,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9064,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Such, in the fond illusion of my heart,"
9065,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Such picture would I at that time have made;
9066,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"And seen the soul of truth in every part,"
9067,ELEGIAC STANZAS,A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed.
9068,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9069,ELEGIAC STANZAS,So once it would have been—’tis so no more;
9070,ELEGIAC STANZAS,I have submitted to a new control:
9071,ELEGIAC STANZAS,A power is gone which nothing can restore;
9072,ELEGIAC STANZAS,A deep distress hath humanized my soul.
9073,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9074,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Not for a moment could I now behold
9075,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"A smiling sea, and be what I have been;"
9076,ELEGIAC STANZAS,The feeling of my loss will ne’er be old;
9077,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"This, which I know, I speak with mind serene."
9078,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9079,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the friend"
9080,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"If he had lived, of him whom I deplore."
9081,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"This work of thine I blame not, but commend;"
9082,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"This sea in anger, and that dismal shore."
9083,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9084,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"O ’tis a passionate work!—yet wise and well,"
9085,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Well chosen is the spirit that is here;
9086,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"That hulk which labours in the deadly swell,"
9087,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!"
9088,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9089,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"And this huge Castle, standing here sublime,"
9090,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"I love to see the look with which it braves,—"
9091,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time—
9092,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"The lightning, the fierce wind, and trampling waves."
9093,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9094,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,"
9095,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Housed in a dream, at distance from the kind!"
9096,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Such happiness, wherever it be known,"
9097,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Is to be pitied, for ’tis surely blind."
9098,ELEGIAC STANZAS,
9099,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,"
9100,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"And frequent sights of what is to be borne,—"
9101,ELEGIAC STANZAS,"Such sights, or worse, as are before me here!"
9102,ELEGIAC STANZAS,Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.

9216,THE PET LAMB,
9217,THE PET LAMB,"THE dew was falling fast, the stars began to blink;"
9218,THE PET LAMB,"I heard a voice: it said, ‘Drink, pretty creature, drink!’"
9219,THE PET LAMB,"And, looking o’er the hedge, before me I espied"
9220,THE PET LAMB,"A snow-white mountain lamb, with a maiden at its side."
9221,THE PET LAMB,
9222,THE PET LAMB,"No other sheep were near, the lamb was all alone,"
9223,THE PET LAMB,And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;
9224,THE PET LAMB,"With one knee on the grass did the little maiden kneel,"
9225,THE PET LAMB,While to that mountain lamb she gave its evening meal.
9226,THE PET LAMB,
9227,THE PET LAMB,"The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took,"
9228,THE PET LAMB,Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure shook.
9229,THE PET LAMB,"‘Drink, pretty creature, drink,’ she said, in such a tone"
9230,THE PET LAMB,That I almost received her heart into my own.
9231,THE PET LAMB,
9232,THE PET LAMB,"’Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare!"
9233,THE PET LAMB,I watched them with delight; they were a lovely pair.
9234,THE PET LAMB,Now with her empty can the maiden turned away;
9235,THE PET LAMB,"But ere ten yards were gone, her footsteps did she stay."
9236,THE PET LAMB,
9237,THE PET LAMB,Towards the lamb she looked; and from that shady place
9238,THE PET LAMB,"I, unobserved, could see the workings of her face;"
9239,THE PET LAMB,"If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,"
9240,THE PET LAMB,"Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little maid might sing:—"
9241,THE PET LAMB,
9242,THE PET LAMB,"‘What ails thee, young one?  What?  Why pull so at thy cord?"
9243,THE PET LAMB,Is it not well with thee?  Well both for bed and board?
9244,THE PET LAMB,"Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be;"
9245,THE PET LAMB,"Rest, little young one, rest; what is’t that aileth thee?"
9246,THE PET LAMB,
9247,THE PET LAMB,‘What is it thou wouldst seek?  What is wanting to thy heart?
9248,THE PET LAMB,"Thy limbs, are they not strong?  And beautiful thou art:"
9249,THE PET LAMB,This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers;
9250,THE PET LAMB,And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!
9251,THE PET LAMB,
9252,THE PET LAMB,"‘If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain,"
9253,THE PET LAMB,"This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain;"
9254,THE PET LAMB,"For rain and mountain storms, the like thou need’st not fear;—"
9255,THE PET LAMB,The rain and storm are things which scarcely can come here.
9256,THE PET LAMB,
9257,THE PET LAMB,"‘Rest, little young one, rest; thou hast forgot the day"
9258,THE PET LAMB,When my father found thee first in places far away:
9259,THE PET LAMB,"Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none;"
9260,THE PET LAMB,And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone.
9261,THE PET LAMB,
9262,THE PET LAMB,"‘He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home:"
9263,THE PET LAMB,A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam?
9264,THE PET LAMB,A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yean
9265,THE PET LAMB,Upon the mountain-tops no kinder could have been.
9266,THE PET LAMB,
9267,THE PET LAMB,‘Thou know’st that twice a day I have brought thee in this can
9268,THE PET LAMB,"Fresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran;"
9269,THE PET LAMB,"And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew,"
9270,THE PET LAMB,"I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is, and new."
9271,THE PET LAMB,
9272,THE PET LAMB,"‘Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now,"
9273,THE PET LAMB,Then I’ll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the plough;
9274,THE PET LAMB,"My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is cold,"
9275,THE PET LAMB,"Our hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold."
9276,THE PET LAMB,
9277,THE PET LAMB,"‘It will not, will not rest!—poor creature, can it be"
9278,THE PET LAMB,That ’tis thy mother’s heart which is working so in thee?
9279,THE PET LAMB,"Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear,"
9280,THE PET LAMB,And dreams of things which thou canst neither see nor hear.
9281,THE PET LAMB,
9282,THE PET LAMB,"‘Alas, the mountain-tops that look so green and fair!"
9283,THE PET LAMB,I’ve heard of fearful winds and darkness that come there;
9284,THE PET LAMB,"The little brooks, that seem all pastime and all play,"
9285,THE PET LAMB,When they are angry roar like lions for their prey.
9286,THE PET LAMB,
9287,THE PET LAMB,‘Here thou need’st not dread the raven in the sky;
9288,THE PET LAMB,"Night and day thou art safe,—our cottage is hard by."
9289,THE PET LAMB,Why bleat so after me?  Why pull so at thy chain?
9290,THE PET LAMB,Sleep—and at break of day I will come to thee again!’
9291,THE PET LAMB,
9292,THE PET LAMB,"As homeward through the lane I went with lazy feet,"
9293,THE PET LAMB,This song to myself did I oftentimes repeat;
9294,THE PET LAMB,"And it seemed, as I retraced the ballad line by line,"
9295,THE PET LAMB,"That but half of it was hers, and one-half of it was mine."
9296,THE PET LAMB,
9297,THE PET LAMB,"Again, and once again did I repeat the song;"
9298,THE PET LAMB,"‘Nay,’ said I, ‘more than half to the damsel must belong,"
9299,THE PET LAMB,"For she looked with such a look, and she spake with such a tone,"
9300,THE PET LAMB,That I almost received her heart into my own.’

9392,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Look round her when the heavens are bare;
9393,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Waters on a starry night
9394,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Are beautiful and fair;
9395,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The sunshine is a glorious birth;
9396,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"But yet I know, where’er I go,"
9397,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,That there hath past away a glory from the earth.
9398,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
9399,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,"
9400,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And while the young lambs bound
9401,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"As to the tabor’s sound,"
9402,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,To me alone there came a thought of grief:
9403,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"A timely utterance gave that thought relief,"
9404,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And I again am strong.
9405,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;—
9406,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,No more shall grief of mine the season wrong:
9407,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"I hear the echoes through the mountains throng,"
9408,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,"
9409,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And all the earth is gay;
9410,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Land and sea
9411,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Give themselves up to jollity,"
9412,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And with the heart of May
9413,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Doth every beast keep holiday;—
9414,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Thou child of joy
9415,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy"
9416,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Shepherd-boy!
9417,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
9418,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Ye blessed Creatures, I have heard the call"
9419,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Ye to each other make; I see
9420,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
9421,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"My heart is at your festival,"
9422,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"My head hath its coronal,"
9423,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all."
9424,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,O evil day! if I were sullen
9425,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,While Earth herself is adorning
9426,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,This sweet May-morning;
9427,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And the children are culling
9428,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"On every side,"
9429,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"In a thousand valleys far and wide,"
9430,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm
9431,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And the babe leaps up on his mother’s arm:—
9432,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!"
9433,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"—But there’s a tree, of many, one,"
9434,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"A single field which I have looked upon,"
9435,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Both of them speak of something that is gone;
9436,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The pansy at my feet
9437,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Doth the same tale repeat:
9438,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
9439,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"
9440,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
9441,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting;
9442,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The Soul that rises with us, our life’s Star,"
9443,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Hath had elsewhere its setting
9444,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And cometh from afar.
9445,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Not in entire forgetfulness,"
9446,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"And not in utter nakedness,"
9447,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,But trailing clouds of glory do we come
9448,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"From God, who is our home;"
9449,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
9450,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Shades of the prison-house begin to close
9451,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Upon the growing Boy,"
9452,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,"
9453,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,He sees it in his joy;
9454,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The Youth, who daily farther from the east"
9455,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Must travel, still is Nature’s priest,"
9456,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And by the vision splendid
9457,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Is on his way attended;
9458,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,At length the Man perceives it die away
9459,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And fade into the light of common day.
9460,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
9461,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
9462,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,"
9463,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"And, even with something of a mother’s mind"
9464,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"And no unworthy aim,"
9465,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The homely nurse doth all she can
9466,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"To make her foster-child, her inmate, Man,"
9467,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Forget the glories he hath known,"
9468,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And that imperial palace whence he came.
9469,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
9470,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,"
9471,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,A six years’ darling of a pigmy size!
9472,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"See, where ’mid work of his own hand he lies,"
9473,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Fretted by sallies of his mother’s kisses,"
9474,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,With light upon him from his father’s eyes!
9475,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,"
9476,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Some fragment from his dream of human life,"
9477,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;
9478,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"A wedding or a festival,"
9479,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,A mourning or a funeral;
9480,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"And this hath now his heart,"
9481,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And unto this he frames his song:
9482,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Then will he fit his tongue
9483,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"To dialogues of business, love, or strife;"
9484,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,But it will not be long
9485,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Ere this be thrown aside,"
9486,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And with new joy and pride
9487,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The little actor cons another part;
9488,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Filling from time to time his ‘humorous stage’
9489,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,"
9490,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,That life brings with her in her equipage;
9491,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,As if his whole vocation
9492,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Were endless imitation.
9493,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
9494,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie"
9495,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Thy soul’s immensity;
9496,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep"
9497,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Thy heritage, thou eye among the blind"
9498,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"That, deaf and silent, read’st the eternal deep,"
9499,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Haunted for ever by the eternal Mind,—"
9500,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Mighty Prophet!  Seer blest!
9501,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,On whom those truths do rest
9502,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Which we are toiling all our lives to find,"
9503,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;"
9504,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Thou, over whom thy Immortality"
9505,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Broods like the day, a master o’er a slave,"
9506,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,A Presence which is not to be put by;
9507,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Thou little child, yet glorious in the might"
9508,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Of heaven-born freedom on thy being’s height,"
9509,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
9510,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"The years to bring the inevitable yoke,"
9511,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
9512,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,"
9513,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And custom lie upon thee with a weight
9514,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!"
9515,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
9516,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,O joy! that in our embers
9517,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Is something that doth live,"
9518,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,That Nature yet remembers
9519,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,What was so fugitive!
9520,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The thought of our past years in me doth breed
9521,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Perpetual benediction: not, indeed,"
9522,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"For that which is most worthy to be blest,"
9523,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Delight and liberty, the simple creed"
9524,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest,"
9525,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:
9526,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,—Not for these I raise
9527,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The song of thanks and praise;
9528,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,But for those obstinate questionings
9529,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Of sense and outward things,"
9530,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Fallings from us, vanishings;"
9531,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Blank misgivings of a creature
9532,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Moving about in worlds not realised,"
9533,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"High instincts, before which our mortal nature"
9534,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:
9535,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"But for those first affections,"
9536,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Those shadowy recollections,"
9537,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Which, be they what they may,"
9538,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,"
9539,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
9540,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make"
9541,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Our noisy years seem moments in the being
9542,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,"
9543,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,To perish never;
9544,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,"
9545,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Nor man nor boy,"
9546,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Nor all that is at enmity with joy,"
9547,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Can utterly abolish or destroy!
9548,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Hence, in a season of calm weather,"
9549,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Though inland far we be,"
9550,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
9551,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Which brought us hither;
9552,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Can in a moment travel thither—
9553,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"And see the children sport upon the shore,"
9554,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.
9555,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
9556,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Then sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!"
9557,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,And let the young lambs bound
9558,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,As to the tabor’s sound!
9559,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"We, in thought, will join your throng,"
9560,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Ye that pipe and ye that play,"
9561,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Ye that through your hearts to-day
9562,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Feel the gladness of the May!
9563,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,What though the radiance which was once so bright
9564,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Be now for ever taken from my sight,"
9565,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Though nothing can bring back the hour
9566,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;"
9567,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"We will grieve not, rather find"
9568,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Strength in what remains behind;
9569,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,In the primal sympathy
9570,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Which, having been, must ever be;"
9571,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,In the soothing thoughts that spring
9572,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Out of human suffering;
9573,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"In the faith that looks through death,"
9574,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,In years that bring the philosophic mind.
9575,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,
9576,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,"
9577,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Forbode not any severing of our loves!
9578,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
9579,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,I only have relinquished one delight
9580,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,To live beneath your more habitual sway:
9581,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,I love the brooks which down their channels fret
9582,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;
9583,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The innocent brightness of a new-born day
9584,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Is lovely yet;
9585,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,The clouds that gather round the setting sun
9586,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Do take a sober colouring from an eye
9587,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,That hath kept watch o’er man’s mortality;
9588,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Another race hath been, and other palms are won."
9589,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Thanks to the human heart by which we live,"
9590,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,"Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,"
9591,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,To me the meanest flower that blows can give
9592,RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD,Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.

9660,THE MAID OF NEIDPATH,Disease had been in Mary’s bower

9662,THE MAID OF NEIDPATH,Though now she sits on Neidpath’s tower

9700,KUBLA KHAN,
9701,KUBLA KHAN,IN Xanadu did Kubla Khan
9702,KUBLA KHAN,A stately pleasure-dome decree:
9703,KUBLA KHAN,"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran"
9704,KUBLA KHAN,Through caverns measureless to man
9705,KUBLA KHAN,Down to a sunless sea.
9706,KUBLA KHAN,So twice five miles of fertile ground
9707,KUBLA KHAN,With walls and towers were girdled round:
9708,KUBLA KHAN,And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
9709,KUBLA KHAN,Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;
9710,KUBLA KHAN,"And here were forests ancient as the hills,"
9711,KUBLA KHAN,Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
9712,KUBLA KHAN,But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted
9713,KUBLA KHAN,Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!
9714,KUBLA KHAN,A savage place! as holy and enchanted
9715,KUBLA KHAN,As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted
9716,KUBLA KHAN,By woman wailing for her demon-lover!
9717,KUBLA KHAN,"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,"
9718,KUBLA KHAN,"As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,"
9719,KUBLA KHAN,A mighty fountain momently was forced:
9720,KUBLA KHAN,Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst
9721,KUBLA KHAN,"Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,"
9722,KUBLA KHAN,Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail;
9723,KUBLA KHAN,And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
9724,KUBLA KHAN,It flung up momently the sacred river.
9725,KUBLA KHAN,Five miles meandering with a mazy motion
9726,KUBLA KHAN,"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,"
9727,KUBLA KHAN,"Then reached the caverns measureless to man,"
9728,KUBLA KHAN,And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:
9729,KUBLA KHAN,"And, ’mid this tumult, Kubla heard from far"
9730,KUBLA KHAN,Ancestral voices prophesying war!
9731,KUBLA KHAN,
9732,KUBLA KHAN,The shadow of the dome of pleasure
9733,KUBLA KHAN,Floated midway on the waves;
9734,KUBLA KHAN,Where was heard the mingled measure
9735,KUBLA KHAN,From the fountain and the caves.
9736,KUBLA KHAN,"It was a miracle of rare device,"
9737,KUBLA KHAN,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!
9738,KUBLA KHAN,A damsel with a dulcimer
9739,KUBLA KHAN,In a vision once I saw:
9740,KUBLA KHAN,"It was an Abyssinian maid,"
9741,KUBLA KHAN,"And on her dulcimer she played,"
9742,KUBLA KHAN,Singing of Mount Abora.
9743,KUBLA KHAN,Could I revive within me
9744,KUBLA KHAN,"Her symphony and song,"
9745,KUBLA KHAN,"To such a deep delight ’twould win me,"
9746,KUBLA KHAN,That with music loud and long
9747,KUBLA KHAN,"I would build that dome in air,"
9748,KUBLA KHAN,That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
9749,KUBLA KHAN,"And all who heard should see them there,"

9834,PART I,And he stoppeth one of three.
9835,PART I,"‘By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,"
9836,PART I,Now wherefore stopp’st thou me?
9837,PART I,
9838,PART I,"‘The Bridegroom’s doors are opened wide,"

9843,PART I,"He holds him with his skinny hand,"

9845,PART I,"‘Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!’"
9846,PART I,Eftsoons his hand dropt he.
9847,PART I,
9848,PART I,He holds him with his glittering eye—
9849,PART I,"The Wedding-Guest stood still,"
9850,PART I,And listens like a three-years’ child:
9851,PART I,The mariner hath his will.
9852,PART I,
9853,PART I,The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:
9854,PART I,He cannot choose but hear;
9855,PART I,"And thus spake on that ancient man,"
9856,PART I,The bright-eyed Mariner.
9857,PART I,
9858,PART I,"‘The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,"
9859,PART I,Merrily did we drop
9860,PART I,"Below the kirk, below the hill,"
9861,PART I,Below the lighthouse top.

9872,PART I,
9873,PART I,"The bride hath paced into the hall,"

9877,PART I,

9882,PART I,
9883,PART I,"‘And now the Storm-blast came, and he"
9884,PART I,Was tyrannous and strong:
9885,PART I,"He struck with his o’ertaking wings,"
9886,PART I,And chased us south along.
9887,PART I,
9888,PART I,‘With sloping masts and dipping prow
9889,PART I,As who pursued with yell and blow
9890,PART I,"Still treads the shadow of his foe,"
9891,PART I,"And forward bends his head,"
9892,PART I,"The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,"
9893,PART I,And southward aye we fled.
9894,PART I,
9895,PART I,"‘And now there came both mist and snow,"
9896,PART I,And it grew wondrous cold:
9897,PART I,"And ice, mast-high, came floating by,"
9898,PART I,As green as emerald.
9899,PART I,
9900,PART I,‘And through the drifts the snowy clifts
9901,PART I,Did send a dismal sheen:
9902,PART I,Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken—
9903,PART I,The ice was all between.
9904,PART I,
9905,PART I,"‘The ice was here, the ice was there,"
9906,PART I,The ice was all around:
9907,PART I,"It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,"
9908,PART I,Like noises in a swound!
9909,PART I,
9910,PART I,"‘At length did cross an Albatross,"
9911,PART I,Thorough the fog it came;
9912,PART I,"As it had been a Christian soul,"
9913,PART I,We hailed it in God’s name.
9914,PART I,
9915,PART I,"‘It ate the food it ne’er had eat,"
9916,PART I,And round and round it flew.
9917,PART I,The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
9918,PART I,The helmsman steered us through!
9919,PART I,
9920,PART I,‘And a good south wind sprang up behind;
9921,PART I,"The Albatross did follow,"
9922,PART I,"And every day, for food or play,"
9923,PART I,Came to the mariner’s hollo!
9924,PART I,
9925,PART I,"‘In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,"
9926,PART I,It perched for vespers nine;
9927,PART I,"Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,"
9928,PART I,Glimmered the white moon-shine.’
9929,PART I,
9930,PART I,"‘God save thee, ancient Mariner!"
9931,PART I,From the fiends that plague thee thus!—
9932,PART I,Why look’st thou so?’—With my cross-bow
9933,PART I,I shot the Albatross.

9939,PART II,The sun now rose upon the right:
9940,PART II,"Out of the sea came he,"
9941,PART II,"Still hid in mist, and on the left"
9942,PART II,Went down into the sea.
9943,PART II,
9944,PART II,"And the good south wind still blew behind,"
9945,PART II,"But no sweet bird did follow,"
9946,PART II,Nor any day for food or play
9947,PART II,Came to the mariner’s hollo!
9948,PART II,
9949,PART II,"And I had done a hellish thing,"
9950,PART II,And it would work ’em woe:
9951,PART II,For all averred I had killed the bird
9952,PART II,That made the breeze to blow.
9953,PART II,"Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay,"
9954,PART II,That made the breeze to blow!
9955,PART II,
9956,PART II,"Nor dim nor red, like God’s own head"
9957,PART II,The glorious Sun uprist:
9958,PART II,Then all averred I had killed the bird
9959,PART II,That brought the fog and mist.
9960,PART II,"’Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,"
9961,PART II,That bring the fog and mist.
9962,PART II,
9963,PART II,"The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,"
9964,PART II,The furrow followed free;
9965,PART II,We were the first that ever burst
9966,PART II,Into that silent sea.
9967,PART II,
9968,PART II,"Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down,"
9969,PART II,’Twas sad as sad could be;
9970,PART II,And we did speak only to break
9971,PART II,The silence of the sea!
9972,PART II,
9973,PART II,"All in a hot and copper sky,"
9974,PART II,"The bloody Sun, at noon,"
9975,PART II,"Right up above the mast did stand,"
9976,PART II,No bigger than the Moon.
9977,PART II,
9978,PART II,"Day after day, day after day,"
9979,PART II,"We stuck, nor breath nor motion;"
9980,PART II,As idle as a painted ship
9981,PART II,Upon a painted ocean.
9982,PART II,
9983,PART II,"Water, water, every where,"
9984,PART II,And all the boards did shrink;
9985,PART II,"Water, water, every where"
9986,PART II,Nor any drop to drink.
9987,PART II,
9988,PART II,The very deep did rot: O Christ!
9989,PART II,That ever this should be!
9990,PART II,"Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs"
9991,PART II,Upon the slimy sea.
9992,PART II,
9993,PART II,"About, about, in reel and rout"
9994,PART II,The death-fires danced at night;
9995,PART II,"The water, like a witch’s oils,"
9996,PART II,"Burnt green, and blue and white."
9997,PART II,
9998,PART II,And some in dreams assured were
9999,PART II,"Of the Spirit that plagued us so,"
10000,PART II,Nine fathom deep he had followed us
10001,PART II,From the land of mist and snow.
10002,PART II,
10003,PART II,"And every tongue, through utter drought,"
10004,PART II,Was withered at the root;
10005,PART II,"We could not speak, no more than if"
10006,PART II,We had been choked with soot.
10007,PART II,
10008,PART II,Ah! well a-day! what evil looks
10009,PART II,Had I from old and young!
10010,PART II,"Instead of the cross, the Albatross"
10011,PART II,About my neck was hung.
10012,PART II,
10013,PART II,
10014,PART III,PART III
10015,PART III,
10016,PART III,
10017,PART III,There passed a weary time.  Each throat
10018,PART III,"Was parched, and glazed each eye."
10019,PART III,A weary time! a weary time!
10020,PART III,How glazed each weary eye—
10021,PART III,"When looking westward, I beheld"
10022,PART III,A something in the sky.
10023,PART III,
10024,PART III,"At first it seemed a little speck,"
10025,PART III,And then it seemed a mist;
10026,PART III,"It moved and moved, and took at last"
10027,PART III,"A certain shape, I wist."
10028,PART III,
10029,PART III,"A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!"
10030,PART III,And still it neared and neared:
10031,PART III,"As if it dodged a water-sprite,"
10032,PART III,It plunged and tacked and veered.
10033,PART III,
10034,PART III,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
10035,PART III,We could nor laugh nor wail;
10036,PART III,Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
10037,PART III,"I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,"
10038,PART III,"And cried, A sail! a sail!"
10039,PART III,
10040,PART III,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
10041,PART III,Agape they heard me call:
10042,PART III,"Gramercy! they for joy did grin,"
10043,PART III,"And all at once their breath drew in,"
10044,PART III,As they were drinking all.
10045,PART III,
10046,PART III,See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
10047,PART III,"Hither to work us weal,"
10048,PART III,"Without a breeze, without a tide,"
10049,PART III,She steadies with upright keel!
10050,PART III,
10051,PART III,"The western wave was all aflame,"
10052,PART III,The day was well nigh done;
10053,PART III,Almost upon the western wave
10054,PART III,Rested the broad bright Sun;
10055,PART III,When that strange shape drove suddenly
10056,PART III,Betwixt us and the Sun!
10057,PART III,
10058,PART III,"And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,"
10059,PART III,(Heaven’s Mother send us grace!)
10060,PART III,As if through a dungeon-grate he peered
10061,PART III,With broad and burning face.
10062,PART III,
10063,PART III,"Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)"
10064,PART III,How fast she nears and nears!
10065,PART III,"Are those her sails that glance in the Sun,"
10066,PART III,Like restless gossameres?
10067,PART III,
10068,PART III,Are those her ribs through which the Sun
10069,PART III,Did peer as through a grate?
10070,PART III,And is that Woman all her crew?
10071,PART III,Is that a Death? and are there two?
10072,PART III,Is Death that woman’s mate?
10073,PART III,
10074,PART III,"Her lips were red, her looks were free,"
10075,PART III,"Her locks were yellow as gold,"
10076,PART III,Her skin was white as leprosy;
10077,PART III,"The Night-mare Life-in-Death was she,"
10078,PART III,Who thicks man’s blood with cold.
10079,PART III,
10080,PART III,"The naked hulk alongside came,"
10081,PART III,And the twain were casting dice;
10082,PART III,‘The game is done!  I’ve won!  I’ve won!’
10083,PART III,"Quoth she, and whistles thrice."
10084,PART III,
10085,PART III,The Sun’s rim dips; the stars rush out:
10086,PART III,At one stride comes the dark;
10087,PART III,"With far-heard whisper, o’er the sea,"
10088,PART III,Off shot the spectre-bark.
10089,PART III,
10090,PART III,We listened and looked sideways up;
10091,PART III,"Fear at my heart, as at a cup,"
10092,PART III,My life-blood seemed to sip!
10093,PART III,"The stars were dim, and thick the night,"
10094,PART III,The steersman’s face by his lamp gleamed white;
10095,PART III,From the sails the dew did drip—
10096,PART III,Till clomb above the eastern bar
10097,PART III,"The horned Moon, with one bright star"
10098,PART III,Within the nether tip.
10099,PART III,
10100,PART III,"One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,"
10101,PART III,"Too quick for groan or sigh,"
10102,PART III,"Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,"
10103,PART III,And cursed me with his eye.
10104,PART III,
10105,PART III,"Four times fifty living men,"
10106,PART III,(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
10107,PART III,"With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,"
10108,PART III,They dropped down one by one.
10109,PART III,
10110,PART III,"The souls did from their bodies fly,—"
10111,PART III,They fled to bliss or woe!
10112,PART III,"And every soul it passed me by,"
10113,PART III,Like the whizz of my cross-bow!

10115,PART III,
10116,PART IV,PART IV
10117,PART IV,
10118,PART IV,
10119,PART IV,"‘I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"
10120,PART IV,I fear thy skinny hand!
10121,PART IV,"And thou art long, and lank, and brown,"
10122,PART IV,As is the ribbed sea-sand.
10123,PART IV,
10124,PART IV,"‘I fear thee and thy glittering eye,"
10125,PART IV,And thy skinny hand so brown.’—
10126,PART IV,"Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!"
10127,PART IV,This body dropt not down.
10128,PART IV,
10129,PART IV,"Alone, alone, all, all alone,"
10130,PART IV,Alone on a wide wide sea!
10131,PART IV,And never a saint took pity on
10132,PART IV,My soul in agony.
10133,PART IV,
10134,PART IV,"The many men, so beautiful!"
10135,PART IV,And they all dead did lie;
10136,PART IV,And a thousand thousand slimy things
10137,PART IV,Lived on; and so did I.
10138,PART IV,
10139,PART IV,"I looked upon the rotting sea,"
10140,PART IV,And drew mine eyes away:
10141,PART IV,"I looked upon the rotting deck,"
10142,PART IV,And there the dead men lay.
10143,PART IV,
10144,PART IV,I looked to heaven and tried to pray;
10145,PART IV,"But or ever a prayer had gusht,"
10146,PART IV,A wicked whisper came and made
10147,PART IV,My heart as dry as dust.
10148,PART IV,
10149,PART IV,"I closed my lids, and kept them close,"
10150,PART IV,And the balls like pulses beat;
10151,PART IV,"For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky"
10152,PART IV,"Lay like a load on my weary eye,"
10153,PART IV,And the dead were at my feet.
10154,PART IV,
10155,PART IV,"The cold sweat melted from their limbs,"
10156,PART IV,Nor rot nor reek did they:
10157,PART IV,The look with which they looked on me
10158,PART IV,Had never passed away.
10159,PART IV,
10160,PART IV,An orphan’s curse would drag to hell
10161,PART IV,A spirit from on high;
10162,PART IV,But oh! more horrible than that
10163,PART IV,Is the curse in a dead man’s eye!
10164,PART IV,"Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,"
10165,PART IV,And yet I could not die.
10166,PART IV,
10167,PART IV,"The moving Moon went up the sky,"
10168,PART IV,And nowhere did abide:
10169,PART IV,"Softly she was going up,"
10170,PART IV,And a star or two beside—
10171,PART IV,
10172,PART IV,"Her beams bemocked the sultry main,"
10173,PART IV,Like April hoar-frost spread;
10174,PART IV,"But where the ship’s huge shadow lay,"
10175,PART IV,The charmed water burnt alway
10176,PART IV,A still and awful red.
10177,PART IV,
10178,PART IV,"Beyond the shadow of the ship,"
10179,PART IV,I watched the water-snakes:
10180,PART IV,"They moved in tracks of shining white,"
10181,PART IV,"And when they reared, the elfish light"
10182,PART IV,Fell off in hoary flakes.
10183,PART IV,
10184,PART IV,Within the shadow of the ship
10185,PART IV,I watched their rich attire:
10186,PART IV,"Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,"
10187,PART IV,They coiled and swam: and every track
10188,PART IV,Was a flash of golden fire.
10189,PART IV,
10190,PART IV,O happy living things! no tongue
10191,PART IV,Their beauty might declare;
10192,PART IV,"A spring of love gushed from my heart,"
10193,PART IV,And I blessed them unaware:
10194,PART IV,"Sure my kind Saint took pity on me,"
10195,PART IV,And I blessed them unaware.
10196,PART IV,
10197,PART IV,The selfsame moment I could pray;
10198,PART IV,And from my neck so free
10199,PART IV,"The Albatross fell off, and sank"
10200,PART IV,Like lead into the sea.
10201,PART IV,
10202,PART IV,
10203,PART V,PART V
10204,PART V,
10205,PART V,
10206,PART V,"O sleep! it is a gentle thing,"
10207,PART V,Beloved from pole to pole!
10208,PART V,To Mary Queen the praise be given!
10209,PART V,"She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,"
10210,PART V,That slid into my soul.
10211,PART V,
10212,PART V,"The silly buckets on the deck,"
10213,PART V,"That had so long remained,"
10214,PART V,I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
10215,PART V,"And when I woke, it rained."
10216,PART V,
10217,PART V,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,"
10218,PART V,My garments all were dank;
10219,PART V,"Sure I had drunken in my dreams,"
10220,PART V,And still my body drank.
10221,PART V,
10222,PART V,"I moved, and could not feel my limbs;"
10223,PART V,I was so light—almost
10224,PART V,"I thought that I had died in sleep,"
10225,PART V,And was a blessed ghost.
10226,PART V,
10227,PART V,And soon I heard a roaring wind:
10228,PART V,It did not come anear;
10229,PART V,"But with its sound it shook the sails,"
10230,PART V,That were so thin and sere.
10231,PART V,
10232,PART V,The upper air burst into life!
10233,PART V,"And a hundred fire-flags sheen,"
10234,PART V,To and fro they were hurried about!
10235,PART V,"And to and fro, and in and out,"
10236,PART V,The wan stars danced between.
10237,PART V,
10238,PART V,"And the coming wind did roar more loud,"
10239,PART V,And the sails did sigh like sedge;
10240,PART V,And the rain poured down from one black cloud;
10241,PART V,The Moon was at its edge.
10242,PART V,
10243,PART V,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still"
10244,PART V,The Moon was at its side:
10245,PART V,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
10246,PART V,"The lightning fell with never a jag,"
10247,PART V,A river steep and wide.
10248,PART V,
10249,PART V,"The loud wind never reached the ship,"
10250,PART V,Yet now the ship moved on!
10251,PART V,Beneath the lightning and the Moon
10252,PART V,The dead men gave a groan.
10253,PART V,
10254,PART V,"They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,"
10255,PART V,"Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;"
10256,PART V,"It had been strange, even in a dream,"
10257,PART V,To have seen those dead men rise.
10258,PART V,
10259,PART V,"The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;"
10260,PART V,Yet never a breeze up blew;
10261,PART V,"The mariners all ’gan work the ropes,"
10262,PART V,Where they were wont to do;
10263,PART V,They raised their limbs like lifeless tools—
10264,PART V,We were a ghastly crew.
10265,PART V,
10266,PART V,The body of my brother’s son
10267,PART V,"Stood by me, knee to knee:"
10268,PART V,The body and I pulled at one rope
10269,PART V,But he said nought to me.
10270,PART V,
10271,PART V,"‘I fear thee, ancient Mariner!’"
10272,PART V,"Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!"
10273,PART V,"’Twas not those souls that fled in pain,"
10274,PART V,"Which to their corses came again,"
10275,PART V,But a troop of spirits blest:
10276,PART V,
10277,PART V,"For when it dawned—they dropped their arms,"
10278,PART V,And clustered round the mast;
10279,PART V,"Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,"
10280,PART V,And from their bodies passed.
10281,PART V,
10282,PART V,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
10283,PART V,Then darted to the Sun;
10284,PART V,"Slowly the sounds came back again,"
10285,PART V,"Now mixed, now one by one."
10286,PART V,
10287,PART V,Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
10288,PART V,I heard the sky-lark sing;
10289,PART V,"Sometimes all little birds that are,"
10290,PART V,How they seemed to fill the sea and air
10291,PART V,With their sweet jargoning!
10292,PART V,
10293,PART V,"And now ’twas like all instruments,"
10294,PART V,Now like a lonely flute;
10295,PART V,"And now it is an angel’s song,"
10296,PART V,That makes the heavens be mute.
10297,PART V,
10298,PART V,It ceased; yet still the sails made on
10299,PART V,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
10300,PART V,A noise like of a hidden brook
10301,PART V,"In the leafy month of June,"
10302,PART V,That to the sleeping woods all night
10303,PART V,Singeth a quiet tune.
10304,PART V,
10305,PART V,"Till noon we quietly sailed on,"
10306,PART V,Yet never a breeze did breathe;
10307,PART V,"Slowly and smoothly went the ship,"
10308,PART V,Moved onward from beneath.
10309,PART V,
10310,PART V,"Under the keel nine fathom deep,"
10311,PART V,"From the land of mist and snow,"
10312,PART V,The spirit slid: and it was he
10313,PART V,That made the ship to go.
10314,PART V,"The sails at noon left off their tune,"
10315,PART V,And the ship stood still also.
10316,PART V,
10317,PART V,"The Sun, right up above the mast,"
10318,PART V,Had fixed her to the ocean:
10319,PART V,"But in a minute she ’gan stir,"
10320,PART V,With a short uneasy motion—
10321,PART V,Backwards and forwards half her length
10322,PART V,With a short uneasy motion.
10323,PART V,
10324,PART V,"Then like a pawing horse let go,"
10325,PART V,She made a sudden bound:
10326,PART V,"It flung the blood into my head,"
10327,PART V,And I fell down in a swound.
10328,PART V,
10329,PART V,"How long in that same fit I lay,"
10330,PART V,I have not to declare;
10331,PART V,"But ere my living life returned,"
10332,PART V,"I heard, and in my soul discerned,"
10333,PART V,Two voices in the air.
10334,PART V,
10335,PART V,"‘Is it he?’ quoth one, ‘Is this the man?"
10336,PART V,"By Him who died on cross,"
10337,PART V,With his cruel bow he laid full low
10338,PART V,The harmless Albatross.
10339,PART V,
10340,PART V,‘The spirit who bideth by himself
10341,PART V,"In the land of mist and snow,"
10342,PART V,He loved the bird that loved the man
10343,PART V,Who shot him with his bow.’
10344,PART V,
10345,PART V,"The other was a softer voice,"
10346,PART V,As soft as honey-dew:
10347,PART V,"Quoth he, ‘The man hath penance done,"
10348,PART V,And penance more will do.’
10349,PART V,
10350,PART V,
10351,PART VI,PART VI
10352,PART VI,
10353,PART VI,
10354,FIRST VOICE,FIRST VOICE
10355,FIRST VOICE,
10356,FIRST VOICE,"‘But tell me, tell me! speak again,"
10357,FIRST VOICE,Thy soft response renewing—
10358,FIRST VOICE,What makes that ship drive on so fast?
10359,FIRST VOICE,What is the ocean doing?’
10360,FIRST VOICE,
10361,SECOND VOICE,SECOND VOICE
10362,SECOND VOICE,
10363,SECOND VOICE,"‘Still as a slave before his lord,"
10364,SECOND VOICE,The ocean hath no blast;
10365,SECOND VOICE,His great bright eye most silently
10366,SECOND VOICE,Up to the moon is cast—
10367,SECOND VOICE,
10368,SECOND VOICE,‘If he may know which way to go;
10369,SECOND VOICE,For she guides him smooth or grim.
10370,SECOND VOICE,"See, brother, see! how graciously"
10371,SECOND VOICE,She looketh down on him.’
10372,SECOND VOICE,
10373,FIRST VOICE,FIRST VOICE
10374,FIRST VOICE,
10375,FIRST VOICE,"‘But why drives on that ship so fast,"
10376,FIRST VOICE,Without or wave or wind?’
10377,FIRST VOICE,
10378,SECOND VOICE,SECOND VOICE
10379,SECOND VOICE,
10380,SECOND VOICE,"‘The air is cut away before,"
10381,SECOND VOICE,And closes from behind.
10382,SECOND VOICE,"‘Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!"
10383,SECOND VOICE,Or we shall be belated:
10384,SECOND VOICE,"For slow and slow that ship will go,"
10385,SECOND VOICE,When the Mariner’s trance is abated.’
10386,SECOND VOICE,
10387,SECOND VOICE,"I woke, and we were sailing on"
10388,SECOND VOICE,As in a gentle weather:
10389,SECOND VOICE,"’Twas night, calm night, the moon was high,"
10390,SECOND VOICE,The dead men stood together.
10391,SECOND VOICE,
10392,SECOND VOICE,"All stood together on the deck,"
10393,SECOND VOICE,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
10394,SECOND VOICE,"All fixed on me their stony eyes,"
10395,SECOND VOICE,That in the Moon did glitter.
10396,SECOND VOICE,
10397,SECOND VOICE,"The pang, the curse, with which they died"
10398,SECOND VOICE,Had never passed away;
10399,SECOND VOICE,"I could not draw my eyes from theirs,"
10400,SECOND VOICE,Nor turn them up to pray.
10401,SECOND VOICE,
10402,SECOND VOICE,And now this spell was snapt: once more
10403,SECOND VOICE,"I viewed the ocean green,"
10404,SECOND VOICE,"And looked far forth, yet little saw"
10405,SECOND VOICE,Of what had else been seen—
10406,SECOND VOICE,
10407,SECOND VOICE,Like one that on a lonesome road
10408,SECOND VOICE,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
10409,SECOND VOICE,"And having once turned round walks on,"
10410,SECOND VOICE,And turns no more his head;
10411,SECOND VOICE,Because he knows a frightful fiend
10412,SECOND VOICE,Doth close behind him tread.
10413,SECOND VOICE,
10414,SECOND VOICE,"But soon there breathed a wind on me,"
10415,SECOND VOICE,Nor sound nor motion made:
10416,SECOND VOICE,"Its path was not upon the sea,"
10417,SECOND VOICE,In ripple or in shade.
10418,SECOND VOICE,
10419,SECOND VOICE,"It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek"
10420,SECOND VOICE,Like a meadow-gale of spring—
10421,SECOND VOICE,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
10422,SECOND VOICE,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
10423,SECOND VOICE,
10424,SECOND VOICE,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,"
10425,SECOND VOICE,Yet she sailed softly too;
10426,SECOND VOICE,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze—"
10427,SECOND VOICE,On me alone it blew.
10428,SECOND VOICE,
10429,SECOND VOICE,O! dream of joy! is this indeed
10430,SECOND VOICE,The lighthouse top I see?
10431,SECOND VOICE,Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
10432,SECOND VOICE,Is this mine own countree?
10433,SECOND VOICE,
10434,SECOND VOICE,"We drifted o’er the harbour bar,"
10435,SECOND VOICE,And I with sobs did pray—
10436,SECOND VOICE,"O let me be awake, my God!"
10437,SECOND VOICE,Or let me sleep alway.
10438,SECOND VOICE,
10439,SECOND VOICE,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,"
10440,SECOND VOICE,So smoothly it was strewn!
10441,SECOND VOICE,"And on the bay the moonlight lay,"
10442,SECOND VOICE,And the shadow of the Moon.
10443,SECOND VOICE,
10444,SECOND VOICE,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less"
10445,SECOND VOICE,That stands above the rock:
10446,SECOND VOICE,The moonlight steeped in silentness
10447,SECOND VOICE,The steady weathercock.
10448,SECOND VOICE,
10449,SECOND VOICE,"And the bay was white with silent light,"
10450,SECOND VOICE,"Till, rising from the same,"
10451,SECOND VOICE,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
10452,SECOND VOICE,In crimson colours came.
10453,SECOND VOICE,
10454,SECOND VOICE,A little distance from the prow
10455,SECOND VOICE,Those crimson shadows were:
10456,SECOND VOICE,I turned my eyes upon the deck—
10457,SECOND VOICE,"O, Christ! what saw I there!"
10458,SECOND VOICE,
10459,SECOND VOICE,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,"
10460,SECOND VOICE,"And, by the holy rood!"
10461,SECOND VOICE,"A man all light, a seraph-man,"
10462,SECOND VOICE,On every corse there stood.
10463,SECOND VOICE,
10464,SECOND VOICE,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand:"
10465,SECOND VOICE,It was a heavenly sight!
10466,SECOND VOICE,"They stood as signals to the land,"
10467,SECOND VOICE,Each one a lovely light;
10468,SECOND VOICE,
10469,SECOND VOICE,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand,"
10470,SECOND VOICE,No voice did they impart—
10471,SECOND VOICE,No voice; but oh! the silence sank
10472,SECOND VOICE,Like music on my heart.
10473,SECOND VOICE,
10474,SECOND VOICE,"But soon I heard the dash of oars,"
10475,SECOND VOICE,I heard the Pilot’s cheer;
10476,SECOND VOICE,"My head was turned perforce away,"
10477,SECOND VOICE,And I saw a boat appear.
10478,SECOND VOICE,
10479,SECOND VOICE,"The Pilot and the Pilot’s boy,"
10480,SECOND VOICE,I heard them coming fast:
10481,SECOND VOICE,Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
10482,SECOND VOICE,The dead men could not blast.
10483,SECOND VOICE,
10484,SECOND VOICE,I saw a third—I heard his voice:
10485,SECOND VOICE,It is the hermit good!
10486,SECOND VOICE,He singeth loud his godly hymns
10487,SECOND VOICE,That he makes in the wood.
10488,SECOND VOICE,"He’ll shrieve my soul, he’ll wash away"
10489,SECOND VOICE,The Albatross’s blood.
10490,SECOND VOICE,
10491,SECOND VOICE,
10492,PART VII,PART VII
10493,PART VII,
10494,PART VII,
10495,PART VII,This Hermit good lives in that wood
10496,PART VII,Which slopes down to the sea.
10497,PART VII,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
10498,PART VII,He loves to talk with marineres
10499,PART VII,That come from a far countree.
10500,PART VII,
10501,PART VII,"He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve,—"
10502,PART VII,He hath a cushion plump:
10503,PART VII,It is the moss that wholly hides
10504,PART VII,The rotted old oak-stump.
10505,PART VII,
10506,PART VII,The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk:
10507,PART VII,"‘Why, this is strange, I trow!"
10508,PART VII,"Where are those lights, so many and fair,"
10509,PART VII,That signal made but now?’
10510,PART VII,
10511,PART VII,"‘Strange, by my faith!’ the Hermit said—"
10512,PART VII,‘And they answered not our cheer!
10513,PART VII,"The planks looked warped! and see those sails,"
10514,PART VII,How thin they are and sere!
10515,PART VII,"I never saw aught like to them,"
10516,PART VII,Unless perchance it were
10517,PART VII,Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
10518,PART VII,My forest-brook along;
10519,PART VII,"When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,"
10520,PART VII,"And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,"
10521,PART VII,That eats the she-wolf’s young.’
10522,PART VII,
10523,PART VII,‘Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look’—
10524,PART VII,(The Pilot made reply)
10525,PART VII,"‘I am a-feared’—‘Push on, push on!’"
10526,PART VII,Said the Hermit cheerily.
10527,PART VII,
10528,PART VII,"The boat came closer to the ship,"
10529,PART VII,But I nor spake nor stirred;
10530,PART VII,"The boat came close beneath the ship,"
10531,PART VII,And straight a sound was heard.
10532,PART VII,
10533,PART VII,"Under the water it rumbled on,"
10534,PART VII,Still louder and more dread;
10535,PART VII,"It reached the ship, it split the bay;"
10536,PART VII,The ship went down like lead.
10537,PART VII,
10538,PART VII,"Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,"
10539,PART VII,"Which sky and ocean smote,"
10540,PART VII,Like one that hath been seven days drowned
10541,PART VII,My body lay afloat;
10542,PART VII,"But swift as dreams, myself I found"
10543,PART VII,Within the Pilot’s boat.
10544,PART VII,
10545,PART VII,"Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,"
10546,PART VII,The boat spun round and round;
10547,PART VII,"And all was still, save that the hill"
10548,PART VII,Was telling of the sound.
10549,PART VII,
10550,PART VII,I moved my lips—the Pilot shrieked
10551,PART VII,And fell down in a fit;
10552,PART VII,"The holy Hermit raised his eyes,"
10553,PART VII,And prayed where he did sit.
10554,PART VII,
10555,PART VII,"I took the oars: the Pilot’s boy,"
10556,PART VII,"Who now doth crazy go,"
10557,PART VII,"Laughed loud and long, and all the while"
10558,PART VII,His eyes went to and fro.
10559,PART VII,"‘Ha! ha!’ quoth he, ‘full plain I see,"
10560,PART VII,The Devil knows how to row.’
10561,PART VII,
10562,PART VII,"And now all in my own countree,"
10563,PART VII,I stood on the firm land!
10564,PART VII,"The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,"
10565,PART VII,And scarcely he could stand.
10566,PART VII,
10567,PART VII,"‘O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!’"
10568,PART VII,The Hermit crossed his brow.
10569,PART VII,"‘Say quick,’ quoth he, ‘I bid thee say—"
10570,PART VII,What manner of man art thou?’
10571,PART VII,
10572,PART VII,Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
10573,PART VII,"With a woful agony,"
10574,PART VII,Which forced me to begin my tale;
10575,PART VII,And then it left me free.
10576,PART VII,
10577,PART VII,"Since then, at an uncertain hour,"
10578,PART VII,That agony returns:
10579,PART VII,"And till my ghastly tale is told,"
10580,PART VII,This heart within me burns.
10581,PART VII,
10582,PART VII,"I pass, like night, from land to land;"
10583,PART VII,I have strange power of speech;
10584,PART VII,"That moment that his face I see,"
10585,PART VII,I know the man that must hear me;
10586,PART VII,To him my tale I teach.
10587,PART VII,
10588,PART VII,What loud uproar bursts from that door!
10589,PART VII,The wedding-guests are there:
10590,PART VII,But in the garden-bower the bride
10591,PART VII,And bride-maids singing are:
10592,PART VII,And hark the little vesper-bell
10593,PART VII,Which biddeth me to prayer!
10594,PART VII,
10595,PART VII,O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been
10596,PART VII,Alone on a wide wide sea:
10597,PART VII,"So lonely ’twas, that God Himself"
10598,PART VII,Scarce seemed there to be.
10599,PART VII,
10600,PART VII,"O sweeter than the marriage-feast,"
10601,PART VII,"’Tis sweeter far to me,"
10602,PART VII,To walk together to the kirk
10603,PART VII,With a goodly company—
10604,PART VII,
10605,PART VII,"To walk together to the kirk,"
10606,PART VII,"And all together pray,"
10607,PART VII,"While each to his great Father bends,"
10608,PART VII,"Old men, and babes, and loving friends,"
10609,PART VII,And youths and maidens gay!
10610,PART VII,
10611,PART VII,"Farewell, farewell! but this I tell"
10612,PART VII,"To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!"
10613,PART VII,He prayeth well who loveth well
10614,PART VII,Both man and bird and beast.
10615,PART VII,
10616,PART VII,He prayeth best who loveth best
10617,PART VII,All things both great and small;
10618,PART VII,"For the dear God who loveth us,"
10619,PART VII,He made and loveth all.
10620,PART VII,
10621,PART VII,"The Mariner, whose eye is bright,"
10622,PART VII,"Whose beard with age is hoar,"
10623,PART VII,Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest
10624,PART VII,Turned from the bridegroom’s door.
10625,PART VII,
10626,PART VII,"He went like one that hath been stunned,"
10627,PART VII,And is of sense forlorn;
10628,PART VII,"A sadder and a wiser man,"
10629,PART VII,He rose the morrow-morn.

11046,TO THE NIGHT,"And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,"
11047,TO THE NIGHT,And the weary Day turned to his rest
11048,TO THE NIGHT,"Lingering like an unloved guest,"
11049,TO THE NIGHT,I sighed for thee.
11050,TO THE NIGHT,
11051,TO THE NIGHT,"Thy brother Death came, and cried"
11052,TO THE NIGHT,Wouldst thou me?
11053,TO THE NIGHT,"Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,"
11054,TO THE NIGHT,"Murmured like a noon-tide bee,"
11055,TO THE NIGHT,Shall I nestle near thy side?
11056,TO THE NIGHT,Wouldst thou me?—And I replied
11057,TO THE NIGHT,"No, not thee!"
11058,TO THE NIGHT,
11059,TO THE NIGHT,"Death will come when thou art dead,"
11060,TO THE NIGHT,"Soon, too soon—"
11061,TO THE NIGHT,Sleep will come when thou art fled;
11062,TO THE NIGHT,Of neither would I ask the boon
11063,TO THE NIGHT,"I ask of thee, beloved Night—"
11064,TO THE NIGHT,"Swift be thine approaching flight,"
11065,TO THE NIGHT,"Come soon, soon!"
11066,TO THE NIGHT,

11069,TO A SKYLARK,TO A SKYLARK
11070,TO A SKYLARK,
11071,TO A SKYLARK,
11072,TO A SKYLARK,"HAIL to thee, blithe Spirit!"
11073,TO A SKYLARK,Bird thou never wert!
11074,TO A SKYLARK,"That from heaven, or near it,"
11075,TO A SKYLARK,Pourest thy full heart
11076,TO A SKYLARK,In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
11077,TO A SKYLARK,
11078,TO A SKYLARK,Higher still and higher
11079,TO A SKYLARK,"From the earth thou springest,"
11080,TO A SKYLARK,"Like a cloud of fire,"
11081,TO A SKYLARK,"The blue deep thou wingest,"
11082,TO A SKYLARK,"And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest."
11083,TO A SKYLARK,
11084,TO A SKYLARK,In the golden lightning
11085,TO A SKYLARK,Of the sunken sun
11086,TO A SKYLARK,"O’er which clouds are brightening,"
11087,TO A SKYLARK,Thou dost float and run
11088,TO A SKYLARK,Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
11089,TO A SKYLARK,
11090,TO A SKYLARK,The pale purple even
11091,TO A SKYLARK,Melts around thy flight:
11092,TO A SKYLARK,Like a star of heaven
11093,TO A SKYLARK,In the broad daylight
11094,TO A SKYLARK,"Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight;"
11095,TO A SKYLARK,
11096,TO A SKYLARK,Keen as are the arrows
11097,TO A SKYLARK,"Of that silver sphere,"
11098,TO A SKYLARK,Whose intense lamp narrows
11099,TO A SKYLARK,In the white dawn clear
11100,TO A SKYLARK,"Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there."
11101,TO A SKYLARK,
11102,TO A SKYLARK,All the earth and air
11103,TO A SKYLARK,"With thy voice is loud,"
11104,TO A SKYLARK,"As, when night is bare,"
11105,TO A SKYLARK,From one lonely cloud
11106,TO A SKYLARK,"The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is over-flowed."
11107,TO A SKYLARK,
11108,TO A SKYLARK,What thou art we know not;
11109,TO A SKYLARK,What is most like thee?
11110,TO A SKYLARK,From rainbow clouds there flow not
11111,TO A SKYLARK,Drops so bright to see
11112,TO A SKYLARK,As from thy presence showers a rain of melody;—
11113,TO A SKYLARK,
11114,TO A SKYLARK,Like a poet hidden
11115,TO A SKYLARK,"In the light of thought,"
11116,TO A SKYLARK,"Singing hymns unbidden,"
11117,TO A SKYLARK,Till the world is wrought
11118,TO A SKYLARK,To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not;
11119,TO A SKYLARK,
11120,TO A SKYLARK,Like a high-born maiden
11121,TO A SKYLARK,"In a palace tower,"
11122,TO A SKYLARK,Soothing her love-laden
11123,TO A SKYLARK,Soul in secret hour
11124,TO A SKYLARK,"With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:"
11125,TO A SKYLARK,
11126,TO A SKYLARK,Like a glow-worm golden
11127,TO A SKYLARK,"In a dell of dew,"
11128,TO A SKYLARK,Scattering unbeholden
11129,TO A SKYLARK,Its aërial hue
11130,TO A SKYLARK,"Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:"
11131,TO A SKYLARK,
11132,TO A SKYLARK,Like a rose embowered
11133,TO A SKYLARK,"In its own green leaves,"
11134,TO A SKYLARK,"By warm winds deflowered,"
11135,TO A SKYLARK,Till the scent it gives
11136,TO A SKYLARK,Makes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves.
11137,TO A SKYLARK,
11138,TO A SKYLARK,Sound of vernal showers
11139,TO A SKYLARK,"On the twinkling grass,"
11140,TO A SKYLARK,"Rain-awakened flowers,"
11141,TO A SKYLARK,All that ever was
11142,TO A SKYLARK,"Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass."
11143,TO A SKYLARK,
11144,TO A SKYLARK,"Teach us, sprite or bird,"
11145,TO A SKYLARK,What sweet thoughts are thine:
11146,TO A SKYLARK,I have never heard
11147,TO A SKYLARK,Praise of love or wine
11148,TO A SKYLARK,That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
11149,TO A SKYLARK,
11150,TO A SKYLARK,Chorus hymeneal
11151,TO A SKYLARK,Or triumphal chaunt
11152,TO A SKYLARK,"Matched with thine, would be all"
11153,TO A SKYLARK,But an empty vaunt—
11154,TO A SKYLARK,A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
11155,TO A SKYLARK,
11156,TO A SKYLARK,What objects are the fountains
11157,TO A SKYLARK,Of thy happy strain?
11158,TO A SKYLARK,"What fields, or waves, or mountains?"
11159,TO A SKYLARK,What shapes of sky or plain?
11160,TO A SKYLARK,What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
11161,TO A SKYLARK,
11162,TO A SKYLARK,With thy clear keen joyance
11163,TO A SKYLARK,Languor cannot be:
11164,TO A SKYLARK,Shadow of annoyance
11165,TO A SKYLARK,Never came near thee:
11166,TO A SKYLARK,Thou lovest; but ne’er knew love’s sad satiety.
11167,TO A SKYLARK,
11168,TO A SKYLARK,Waking or asleep
11169,TO A SKYLARK,Thou of death must deem
11170,TO A SKYLARK,Things more true and deep
11171,TO A SKYLARK,"Than we mortals dream,"
11172,TO A SKYLARK,Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
11173,TO A SKYLARK,
11174,TO A SKYLARK,"We look before and after,"
11175,TO A SKYLARK,And pine for what is not:
11176,TO A SKYLARK,Our sincerest laughter
11177,TO A SKYLARK,With some pain is fraught;
11178,TO A SKYLARK,Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
11179,TO A SKYLARK,
11180,TO A SKYLARK,Yet if we could scorn
11181,TO A SKYLARK,"Hate, and pride, and fear;"
11182,TO A SKYLARK,If we were things born
11183,TO A SKYLARK,"Not to shed a tear,"
11184,TO A SKYLARK,I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
11185,TO A SKYLARK,
11186,TO A SKYLARK,Better than all measures
11187,TO A SKYLARK,"Of delightful sound,"
11188,TO A SKYLARK,Better than all treasures
11189,TO A SKYLARK,"That in books are found,"
11190,TO A SKYLARK,"Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!"
11191,TO A SKYLARK,
11192,TO A SKYLARK,Teach me half the gladness
11193,TO A SKYLARK,"That thy brain must know,"
11194,TO A SKYLARK,Such harmonious madness
11195,TO A SKYLARK,"From my lips would flow,"
11196,TO A SKYLARK,"The world should listen then, as I am listening now!"
11197,TO A SKYLARK,

11200,TO THE MOON,TO THE MOON
11201,TO THE MOON,
11202,TO THE MOON,
11203,TO THE MOON,ART thou pale for weariness
11204,TO THE MOON,"Of climbing heaven, and gazing on the earth,"
11205,TO THE MOON,Wandering companionless
11206,TO THE MOON,"Among the stars that have a different birth,—"
11207,TO THE MOON,"And ever-changing, like a joyless eye"
11208,TO THE MOON,That finds no object worth its constancy?

11215,THE QUESTION,I DREAMED that as I wandered by the way
11216,THE QUESTION,"Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring,"
11217,THE QUESTION,"And gentle odours led my steps astray,"
11218,THE QUESTION,Mixed with a sound of waters murmuring
11219,THE QUESTION,"Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay"
11220,THE QUESTION,"Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling"
11221,THE QUESTION,"Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,"
11222,THE QUESTION,"But kissed it and then fled, as Thou mightest in dream."
11223,THE QUESTION,
11224,THE QUESTION,"There grew pied wind-flowers and violets,"
11225,THE QUESTION,"Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the earth,"
11226,THE QUESTION,The constellated flower that never sets;
11227,THE QUESTION,"Faint oxlips; tender blue-bells, at whose birth"
11228,THE QUESTION,The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets
11229,THE QUESTION,"Its mother’s face with heaven-collected tears,"
11230,THE QUESTION,"When the low wind, its playmate’s voice, it hears."
11231,THE QUESTION,
11232,THE QUESTION,"And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,"
11233,THE QUESTION,"Green cow-bind and the moonlight-coloured May,"
11234,THE QUESTION,"And cherry-blossoms, and white cups, whose wine"
11235,THE QUESTION,Was the bright dew yet drained not by the day;
11236,THE QUESTION,"And wild roses, and ivy serpentine"
11237,THE QUESTION,"With its dark buds and leaves, wandering astray;"
11238,THE QUESTION,"And flowers azure, black, and streaked with gold,"
11239,THE QUESTION,Fairer than any wakened eyes behold.
11240,THE QUESTION,
11241,THE QUESTION,And nearer to the river’s trembling edge
11242,THE QUESTION,"There grew broad flag-flowers, purple pranked with white,"
11243,THE QUESTION,"And starry river-buds among the sedge,"
11244,THE QUESTION,"And floating water-lilies, broad and bright,"
11245,THE QUESTION,Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
11246,THE QUESTION,With moonlight beams of their own watery light;
11247,THE QUESTION,"And bulrushes, and reeds of such deep green"
11248,THE QUESTION,As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen.
11249,THE QUESTION,
11250,THE QUESTION,Methought that of these visionary flowers
11251,THE QUESTION,"I made a nosegay, bound in such a way"
11252,THE QUESTION,"That the same hues, which in their natural bowers"
11253,THE QUESTION,"Were mingled or opposed, the like array"
11254,THE QUESTION,Kept these imprisoned children of the Hours
11255,THE QUESTION,"Within my hand,—and then, elate and gay,"
11256,THE QUESTION,I hastened to the spot whence I had come
11257,THE QUESTION,That I might there present it—O! to Whom?

11423,"THE INVITATION, TO JANE","The brightest hour of unborn Spring,"

11437,"THE INVITATION, TO JANE","Away, away, from men and towns,"

11493,THE RECOLLECTION,NOW the last day of many days
11494,THE RECOLLECTION,"All beautiful and bright as thou,"
11495,THE RECOLLECTION,"The loveliest and the last, is dead:"
11496,THE RECOLLECTION,"Rise, Memory, and write its praise!"
11497,THE RECOLLECTION,"Up—to thy wonted work! come, trace"
11498,THE RECOLLECTION,"The epitaph of glory fled,"
11499,THE RECOLLECTION,"For now the earth has changed its face,"
11500,THE RECOLLECTION,A frown is on the heaven’s brow.
11501,THE RECOLLECTION,
11502,THE RECOLLECTION,We wandered to the Pine Forest
11503,THE RECOLLECTION,That skirts the Ocean’s foam;
11504,THE RECOLLECTION,"The lightest wind was in its nest,"
11505,THE RECOLLECTION,The tempest in its home.
11506,THE RECOLLECTION,"The whispering waves were half asleep,"
11507,THE RECOLLECTION,"The clouds were gone to play,"
11508,THE RECOLLECTION,And on the bosom of the deep
11509,THE RECOLLECTION,The smile of heaven lay;
11510,THE RECOLLECTION,It seemed as if the hour were one
11511,THE RECOLLECTION,Sent from beyond the skies
11512,THE RECOLLECTION,Which scattered from above the sun
11513,THE RECOLLECTION,A light of Paradise!
11514,THE RECOLLECTION,
11515,THE RECOLLECTION,We paused amid the pines that stood
11516,THE RECOLLECTION,"The giants of the waste,"
11517,THE RECOLLECTION,Tortured by storms to shapes as rude
11518,THE RECOLLECTION,"As serpents interlaced,—"
11519,THE RECOLLECTION,And soothed by every azure breath
11520,THE RECOLLECTION,"That under heaven is blown,"
11521,THE RECOLLECTION,"To harmonies and hues beneath,"
11522,THE RECOLLECTION,As tender as its own:
11523,THE RECOLLECTION,Now all the tree-tops lay asleep
11524,THE RECOLLECTION,"Like green waves on the sea,"
11525,THE RECOLLECTION,As still as in the silent deep
11526,THE RECOLLECTION,The ocean-woods may be.
11527,THE RECOLLECTION,
11528,THE RECOLLECTION,How calm it was!—The silence there
11529,THE RECOLLECTION,"By such a chain was bound,"
11530,THE RECOLLECTION,That even the busy woodpecker
11531,THE RECOLLECTION,Made stiller with her sound
11532,THE RECOLLECTION,The inviolable quietness;
11533,THE RECOLLECTION,The breath of peace we drew
11534,THE RECOLLECTION,With its soft motion made not less
11535,THE RECOLLECTION,The calm that round us grew.
11536,THE RECOLLECTION,"There seemed, from the remotest seat"
11537,THE RECOLLECTION,Of the white mountain waste
11538,THE RECOLLECTION,"To the soft flower beneath our feet,"
11539,THE RECOLLECTION,"A magic circle traced,—"
11540,THE RECOLLECTION,"A spirit interfused around,"
11541,THE RECOLLECTION,A thrilling silent life;
11542,THE RECOLLECTION,To momentary peace it bound
11543,THE RECOLLECTION,Our mortal nature’s strife;—
11544,THE RECOLLECTION,And still I felt the centre of
11545,THE RECOLLECTION,The magic circle there
11546,THE RECOLLECTION,Was one fair form that filled with love
11547,THE RECOLLECTION,The lifeless atmosphere.
11548,THE RECOLLECTION,
11549,THE RECOLLECTION,We paused beside the pools that lie
11550,THE RECOLLECTION,Under the forest bough;
11551,THE RECOLLECTION,Each seemed as ’twere a little sky
11552,THE RECOLLECTION,Gulfed in a world below;
11553,THE RECOLLECTION,A firmament of purple light
11554,THE RECOLLECTION,"Which in the dark earth lay,"
11555,THE RECOLLECTION,More boundless than the depth of night
11556,THE RECOLLECTION,And purer than the day—
11557,THE RECOLLECTION,In which the lovely forests grew
11558,THE RECOLLECTION,"As in the upper air,"
11559,THE RECOLLECTION,More perfect both in shape and hue
11560,THE RECOLLECTION,Than any spreading there.
11561,THE RECOLLECTION,"There lay the glade and neighbouring lawn,"
11562,THE RECOLLECTION,And through the dark green wood
11563,THE RECOLLECTION,The white sun twinkling like the dawn
11564,THE RECOLLECTION,Out of a speckled cloud.
11565,THE RECOLLECTION,"Sweet views, which in our world above"
11566,THE RECOLLECTION,"Can never well be seen,"
11567,THE RECOLLECTION,Were imaged in the water’s love
11568,THE RECOLLECTION,Of that fair forest green:
11569,THE RECOLLECTION,And all was interfused beneath
11570,THE RECOLLECTION,"With an Elysian glow,"
11571,THE RECOLLECTION,"An atmosphere without a breath,"
11572,THE RECOLLECTION,A softer day below.
11573,THE RECOLLECTION,"Like one beloved, the scene had lent"
11574,THE RECOLLECTION,To the dark water’s breast
11575,THE RECOLLECTION,Its every leaf and lineament
11576,THE RECOLLECTION,With more than truth exprest;
11577,THE RECOLLECTION,"Until an envious wind crept by,"
11578,THE RECOLLECTION,Like an unwelcome thought
11579,THE RECOLLECTION,Which from the mind’s too faithful eye
11580,THE RECOLLECTION,Blots one dear image out.
11581,THE RECOLLECTION,"—Though thou art ever fair and kind,"
11582,THE RECOLLECTION,"The forests ever green,"
11583,THE RECOLLECTION,Less oft is peace in Shelley’s mind
11584,THE RECOLLECTION,Than calm in waters seen!

12476,NOTES,"Campion’s ‘airs,’ for which he wrote his words, laid rules too urgent"
12477,NOTES,upon what would have been a delicate genius in poetry.  The airs demanded
12478,NOTES,"so many stanzas; but they gave his imagination leave to be away, and they"
12479,NOTES,"depressed and even confused his metrical play, hurting thus the two vital"
12480,NOTES,spots of poetry.  Many of the stanzas for music make an unlucky repeating
12481,NOTES,pattern with the poor variety that a repeating wall-paper does not
12482,NOTES,attempt.  And yet Campion began again and again with the onset of a true
12483,NOTES,"poet.  Take, for example, the poem beginning with the vitality of this"
12484,NOTES,"line, ‘touching in its majesty’—"
12485,NOTES,
12486,NOTES,"‘Awake, thou spring of speaking grace; mute rest becomes not thee!’"
12487,NOTES,
12488,NOTES,Who would have guessed that the piece was to close in a jogging stanza
12489,NOTES,"containing a reflection on the fact that brutes are speechless, with"
12490,NOTES,these two final lines—
12491,NOTES,
12492,NOTES,"‘If speech be then the best of graces,"
12493,NOTES,Doe it not in slumber smother!’
12494,NOTES,
12495,NOTES,Campion yields a curious collection of beautiful first lines.
12496,NOTES,
12497,NOTES,"‘Sleep, angry beauty, sleep and fear not me’"
12498,NOTES,
12499,NOTES,is far finer than anything that follows.  So is there a single gloom in
12500,NOTES,this—
12501,NOTES,
12502,NOTES,"‘Follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow!’"
12503,NOTES,
12504,NOTES,And a single joy in this—
12505,NOTES,
12506,NOTES,"‘Oh, what unhoped-for sweet supply!’"
12507,NOTES,
12508,NOTES,Another solitary line is one that by its splendour proves Campion the
12509,NOTES,author of _Cherry Ripe_—
12510,NOTES,
12511,NOTES,‘A thousand cherubim fly in her looks.’
12512,NOTES,
12513,NOTES,And yet ‘a thousand cherubim’ is a line of a poem full of the dullest
12514,NOTES,kind of reasoning—curious matter for music—and of the intricate knotting
12515,NOTES,of what is a very simple thread of thought.  It was therefore no easy
12516,NOTES,matter to choose something of Campion’s for a collection of the finest
12517,NOTES,work.  For an historical book of representative poetry the question would
12518,NOTES,"be easy enough, for there Campion should appear by his glorious lyric,"
12519,NOTES,"_Cherry Ripe_, by one or two poems of profounder imagination (however"
12520,NOTES,"imperfect), and by a madrigal written for the music (however the stanzas"
12521,NOTES,may flag in their quibbling).  But the work of choosing among his lyrics
12522,NOTES,"for the sake of beauty shows too clearly the inequality, the brevity of"
12523,NOTES,"the inspiration, and the poet’s absolute disregard of the moment of its"
12524,NOTES,flight and departure.
12525,NOTES,
12526,NOTES,"A few splendid lines may be reason enough for extracting a short poem,"
12527,NOTES,but must not be made to bear too great a burden.

12539,NOTES,
12540,NOTES,It is as solemn and fantastic at the close as at this dark and splendid

12542,NOTES,must bind Campion to that period without question; and as he lived
12543,NOTES,"thirty-six years in the actual reign of Elizabeth, and printed his _Book"
12544,NOTES,"of Airs_ with Rosseter two years before her death, it is by no violence"
12545,NOTES,that we give him the name that covers our earlier poets of the great age.
12546,NOTES,_When thou must Home_ is of the day of Marlowe.  It has the qualities of
12547,NOTES,"great poetry, and especially the quality of keeping its simplicity; and"

12549,NOTES,"large, gay, credulous, tragic, sombre, and amorous."

12565,NOTES,The freshest of Ben Jonson’s lyrics have been chosen.  Obviously it is
12566,NOTES,"freshness that he generally lacks, for all his vigour, his emphatic"
12567,NOTES,"initiative, and his overhearing and impulsive voice in verse.  There is a"
12568,NOTES,stale breath in that hearty shout.  Doubtless it is to the credit of his
12569,NOTES,honesty that he did not adopt the country-phrases in vogue; but when he
12570,NOTES,takes landscape as a task the effect is ill enough.  I have already had
12571,NOTES,"the temerity to find fault, for a blunder of meaning, with the passage of"
12572,NOTES,"a most famous lyric, where it says the contrary of what it would say—"
12573,NOTES,
12574,NOTES,‘But might I of Jove’s nectar sup
12575,NOTES,I would not change for thine;’
12576,NOTES,
12577,NOTES,and for doing so have encountered the anger rather than the argument of
12578,NOTES,those who cannot admire a pretty lyric but they must hold reason itself
12579,NOTES,to be in error rather than allow that a line of it has chanced to get
12580,NOTES,turned in the rhyming.

12598,NOTES,"All Drummond’s poems seem to be minor poems, even at their finest, except"
12599,NOTES,"only this.  He must have known, for the creation of that poem, some more"
12600,NOTES,"impassioned and less restless hour.  It is, from the outset to the close,"
12601,NOTES,"the sigh of a profound expectation.  There is no division into stanzas,"
12602,NOTES,because its metre is the breath of life.  One might wish that the English
12603,NOTES,"ode (roughly called ‘Pindaric’) had never been written but with passion,"
12604,NOTES,for so written it is the most immediate of all metres; the shock of the
12605,NOTES,heart and the breath of elation or grief are the law of the lines.  It
12606,NOTES,"has passed out of the gates of the garden of stanzas, and walks (not"
12607,NOTES,"astray) in the further freedom where all is interior law.  Cowley, long"
12608,NOTES,"afterwards, wrote this Pindaric ode, and wrote it coldly.  But Drummond’s"
12609,NOTES,(he calls it a song) can never again be forgotten.  With admirable
12610,NOTES,judgment it was set up at the very gate of that _Golden Treasury_ we all
12611,NOTES,"know so well; and, therefore, generation after generation of readers, who"
12612,NOTES,"have never opened Drummond’s poems, know this fine ode as well as they"
12613,NOTES,know any single poem in the whole of English literature.  There was a
12614,NOTES,"generation that had not been taught by the _Golden Treasury_, and"
12615,NOTES,Cardinal Newman was of it.  Writing to Coventry Patmore of his great
12616,NOTES,"odes, he called them beautiful but fragmentary; was inclined to wish that"
12617,NOTES,they might some day be made complete.  There is nothing in all poetry
12618,NOTES,more complete.  Seldom is a poem in stanzas so complete but that another
12619,NOTES,stanza might have made a final close; but a master’s ode has the unity of
12620,NOTES,"life, and when it ends it ends for ever."
12621,NOTES,
12622,NOTES,A poem of Drummond’s has this auroral image of a blush: Anthea has
12623,NOTES,"blushed to hear her eyes likened to stars (habit might have caused her,"
12624,NOTES,"one would think, to hear the flattery with a front as cool as the very"
12625,NOTES,"daybreak), and the lover tells her that the sudden increase of her beauty"
12626,NOTES,"is futile, for he cannot admire more: ‘For naught thy cheeks that morn do"
12627,NOTES,"raise.’  What sweet, nay, what solemn roses!"
12628,NOTES,
12629,NOTES,Again:

12682,NOTES,"Greatness seems generally, in the arts, to be of two kinds, and the third"

12684,NOTES,"almost squalid plea of all the poets, from Ronsard to Herrick: ‘Time is"
12685,NOTES,short; they make the better bargain who make haste to love.’  This
12686,NOTES,thrifty business and essentially cold impatience was—time out of
12687,NOTES,"mind—unknown to the truer love; it is larger, illiberal, untender, and"
12688,NOTES,without all dignity.  The poets were wrong to give their verses the
12689,NOTES,message of so sorry a warning.  There is only one thing that persuades
12690,NOTES,you to forgive the paltry plea of the poet that time is brief—and that is

12732,NOTES,‘Fair and flagrant things’—Crashaw’s own phrase—might serve for a
12733,NOTES,brilliant and fantastic praise and protest in description of his own
12734,NOTES,"verses.  In the last century, despite the opinion of a few, and despite"
12735,NOTES,the fact that Pope took possession of Crashaw’s line—
12736,NOTES,
12737,NOTES,"‘Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep,’"
12738,NOTES,
12739,NOTES,"and for some time of the present century, the critics had a wintry word"
12740,NOTES,"to blame him with.  They said of George Herbert, of Lovelace, of Crashaw,"
12741,NOTES,and of other light hearts of the seventeenth century—not so much that
12742,NOTES,"their inspiration was in bad taste, as that no reader of taste could"
12743,NOTES,suffer them.  A better opinion on that company of poets is that they had
12744,NOTES,"a taste extraordinarily liberal, generous, and elastic, but not"
12745,NOTES,"essentially lax: taste that gave now and then too much room to play, but"
12746,NOTES,anon closed with the purest and exactest laws of temperance and measure.
12747,NOTES,The extravagance of Crashaw is a far more lawful thing than the
12748,NOTES,"extravagance of Addison, whom some believe to have committed none;"
12749,NOTES,"moreover, Pope and all the politer poets nursed something they were"
12750,NOTES,"pleased to call a ‘rage,’ and this expatiated (to use another word of"
12751,NOTES,their own) beyond all bounds.  Of sheer voluntary extremes it is not in
12752,NOTES,"the seventeenth century conceit that we should seek examples, but in an"
12753,NOTES,"eighteenth century ‘rage.’  A ‘noble rage,’ properly provoked, could be"
12754,NOTES,backed to write more trash than fancy ever tempted the half-incredulous
12755,NOTES,"sweet poet of the older time to run upon.  He was fancy’s child, and the"
12756,NOTES,bard of the eighteenth century was the child of common sense with straws
12757,NOTES,in his hair—vainly arranged there.  The eighteenth century was never
12758,NOTES,content with a moderate mind; it invented ‘rage’; it matched rage with a
12759,NOTES,flagrant diction mingled of Latin words and simple English words made
12760,NOTES,"vacant and ridiculous, and these were the worst; it was resolved to be"
12761,NOTES,"behind no century in passion—nay, to show the way, to fire the nations."
12762,NOTES,"Addison taught himself, as his hero taught the battle, ‘where to rage’;"
12763,NOTES,"and in the later years of the same literary age, Johnson summoned the"
12764,NOTES,"lapsed and absent fury, with no kind of misgiving as to the resulting"
12765,NOTES,"verse.  Take such a phrase as ‘the madded land’; there, indeed, is a word"
12766,NOTES,coined by the noble rage as the last century evoked it.  ‘The madded
12767,NOTES,"land’ is a phrase intended to prove that the law-giver of taste, Johnson"
12768,NOTES,"himself, could lodge the fury in his breast when opportunity occurred."
12769,NOTES,‘And dubious title shakes the madded land.’  It would be hard to find
12770,NOTES,"anything, even in Addison, more flagrant and less fair."
12771,NOTES,
12772,NOTES,Take _The Weeper_ of Crashaw—his most flagrant poem.  Its follies are all
12773,NOTES,"sweet-humoured, they smile.  Its beauties are a quick and abundant"
12774,NOTES,shower.  The delicate phrases are so mingled with the flagrant that it is
12775,NOTES,difficult to quote them without rousing that general sense of humour of
12776,NOTES,which any one may make a boast; and I am therefore shy even of citing the
12777,NOTES,‘brisk cherub’ who has early sipped the Saint’s tear: ‘Then to his
12778,NOTES,"music,’ in Crashaw’s divinely simple phrase; and his singing ‘tastes of"
12779,NOTES,"this breakfast all day long.’  Sorrow is a queen, he cries to the Weeper,"
12780,NOTES,"and when sorrow would be seen in state, ‘then is she drest by none but"
12781,NOTES,"thee.’  Then you come upon the fancy, ‘Fountain and garden in one face.’"
12782,NOTES,"All places, times, and objects are ‘Thy tears’ sweet opportunity.’  If"
12783,NOTES,"these charming passages lurk in his worst poems, the reader of this"
12784,NOTES,anthology will not be able to count them in his best.  In the Epiphany
12785,NOTES,Hymn the heavens have found means
12786,NOTES,
12787,NOTES,"‘To disinherit the sun’s rise,"
12788,NOTES,Delicately to displace
12789,NOTES,"The day, and plant it fairer in thy face.’"
12790,NOTES,
12791,NOTES,"_To the Morning_: _Satisfaction for Sleep_, is, all through, luminous."
12792,NOTES,"It would he difficult to find, even in the orient poetry of that time,"
12793,NOTES,"more daylight or more spirit.  True, an Elizabethan would not have had"
12794,NOTES,"poetry so rich as in _Love’s Horoscope_, but yet an Elizabethan would"
12795,NOTES,have had it no fresher.  The _Hymn to St. Teresa_ has the brevities which
12796,NOTES,this poet—reproached with his _longueurs_—masters so well.  He tells how
12797,NOTES,"the Spanish girl, six years old, set out in search of death: ‘She’s for"
12798,NOTES,"the Moors and Martyrdom.  Sweet, not so fast!’  Of many contemporary"
12799,NOTES,"songs in pursuit of a fugitive Cupid, Crashaw’s _Cupid’s Cryer_: _out of"
12800,NOTES,"the Greek_, is the most dainty.  But if readers should be a little vexed"
12801,NOTES,"with the poet’s light heart and perpetual pleasure, with the late"
12802,NOTES,"ripeness of his sweetness, here, for their satisfaction, is a passage"
12803,NOTES,capable of the great age that had lately closed when Crashaw wrote.  It
12804,NOTES,is in his summons to nature and art:
12805,NOTES,
12806,NOTES,"‘Come, and come strong,"
12807,NOTES,To the conspiracy of our spacious song!’
12808,NOTES,
12809,NOTES,I have been obliged to take courage to alter the reading of the
12810,NOTES,"seventeenth and nineteenth lines of the _Prayer-Book_, so as to make them"
12811,NOTES,intelligible; they had been obviously misprinted.  I have also found it
12812,NOTES,necessary to re-punctuate generally.

12842,NOTES,
12843,NOTES,
12844,NOTES,It is somewhat to be regretted that this splendid poem should show Cowley
12845,NOTES,as the writer of the alexandrine that divides into two lines.  For he it
12846,NOTES,was who first used (or first conspicuously used) the alexandrine that is
12847,NOTES,"organic, integral, and itself a separate unit of metre.  He first passed"
12848,NOTES,"beyond the heroic line, or at least he first used the alexandrine freely,"
12849,NOTES,"at his pleasure, amid heroic verse; and after him Dryden took possession"
12850,NOTES,"and then Pope.  But both these masters, when they wrote alexandrines,"
12851,NOTES,"wrote them in the French manner, divided.  Cowley, however, with"
12852,NOTES,"admirable art, is able to prevent even an accidental pause, making the"
12853,NOTES,middle of his line fall upon the middle of some word that is rapid in the
12854,NOTES,speaking and therefore indivisible by pause or even by any lingering.
12855,NOTES,Take this one instance—
12856,NOTES,
12857,NOTES,‘Like some fair pine o’erlooking all the ignobler wood.’
12858,NOTES,
12859,NOTES,If Cowley’s delicate example had ruled in English poetry (and he surely
12860,NOTES,"had authority on this one point, at least), this alexandrine would have"
12861,NOTES,"taken its own place as an important line of English metre, more mobile"
12862,NOTES,"than the heroic, less fitted to epic or dramatic poetry, but a line"
12863,NOTES,"liberally lyrical.  It would have been the light, pursuing wave that runs"
12864,NOTES,"suddenly, outrunning twenty, further up the sands than these, a swift"
12865,NOTES,"traveller, unspent, of longer impulse, of more impetuous foot, of fuller"
12866,NOTES,"and of hastier breath, more eager to speak, and yet more reluctant to"
12867,NOTES,"have done.  Cowley left the line with all this lyrical promise within it,"
12868,NOTES,"and if his example had been followed, English prosody would have had in"
12869,NOTES,this a valuable bequest.
12870,NOTES,
12871,NOTES,"Cowley probably was two or three years younger than Richard Crashaw, and"
12872,NOTES,the alexandrine is to be found—to be found by searching—in Crashaw; and
12873,NOTES,he took precisely the same care as Cowley that the long wand of that line
12874,NOTES,should not give way in the middle—should be strong and supple and should
12875,NOTES,last.  Here are four of his alexandrines—
12876,NOTES,
12877,NOTES,"‘Or you, more noble architects of intellectual noise.’"
12878,NOTES,
12879,NOTES,"‘Of sweets you have, and murmur that you have no more.’"
12880,NOTES,
12881,NOTES,‘And everlasting series of a deathless song.’
12882,NOTES,
12883,NOTES,‘To all the dear-bought nations this redeeming name.’
12884,NOTES,
12885,NOTES,A later poet—Coventry Patmore—wrote a far longer line than even these—a
12886,NOTES,"line not only speeding further, but speeding with a more celestial"
12887,NOTES,movement than Cowley or Crashaw heard with the ear of dreams.
12888,NOTES,
12889,NOTES,"‘He unhappily adopted,’ says Dr. Johnson as to Cowley’s diction, ‘that"
12890,NOTES,which was predominant.’  ‘That which was predominant’ was as good a
12891,NOTES,vintage of English language as the cycles of history have ever brought to

12898,NOTES,
12899,NOTES,"Colonel Richard Lovelace, an enchanting poet, is hardly read, except for"
12900,NOTES,two poems which are as famous as any in our language.  Perhaps the rumour
12901,NOTES,of his conceits has frightened his reader.  It must be granted they are
12902,NOTES,now and then daunting; there is a poem on ‘Princess Louisa Drawing’ which
12903,NOTES,is a very maze; the little paths of verse and fancy turn in upon one
12904,NOTES,"another, and the turns are pointed with artificial shouts of joy and"
12905,NOTES,"surprise.  But, again, what a reader unused to a certain living symbolism"
12906,NOTES,"will be apt to take for a careful and cold conceit is, in truth, a"
12907,NOTES,"rapture—none graver, none more fiery or more luminous.  But even to name"
12908,NOTES,the poem where these occur might be to deliver delicate and ardent poetry
12909,NOTES,"over to the general sense of humour, which one distrusts.  Nor is"
12910,NOTES,Lovelace easy reading at any time (the two or three famous poems
12911,NOTES,excepted).  The age he adorned lived in constant readiness for the
12912,NOTES,fiddler.  Eleven o’clock in the morning was as good an hour as another
12913,NOTES,"for a dance, and poetry, too, was gay betimes, but intricate with"
12914,NOTES,"figures.  It is the very order, the perspective, as it were, of the"
12915,NOTES,"movement that seems to baffle the eye, but the game was a free impulse."
12916,NOTES,"Since the first day danced with the first night, no dancing was more"
12917,NOTES,"natural—at least to a dancer of genius.  True, the dance could be"
12918,NOTES,"tyrannous.  It was an importunate fashion.  When the Bishop of Hereford,"
12919,NOTES,"compelled by Robin Hood, in merry Barnsdale, danced in his boots (‘and"
12920,NOTES,"glad he could so get away’), he was hardly in worse heart or trim than a"
12921,NOTES,seventeenth century author here and there whose original seriousness or

12923,NOTES,"halting, as the muse might naturally incline with him, but whom the tune,"
12924,NOTES,"the grace, and gallantry of the time beckoned to tread a perpetual"
12925,NOTES,"measure.  Lovelace was a dancer of genius; nay, he danced to rest his"
12926,NOTES,"wings, for he was winged, cap and heel.  The fiction of flight has lost"
12927,NOTES,"its charm long since.  Modern art grew tired of the idea, now turned to"
12928,NOTES,"commonplace, and painting took leave of the buoyant urchins—naughty"
12929,NOTES,cherub and Cupid together; but the seventeenth century was in love with
12930,NOTES,"that old fancy—more in love, perhaps, than any century in the past.  Its"
12931,NOTES,"late painters, whose human figures had no lack of weight upon the"
12932,NOTES,"comfortable ground, yet kept a sense of buoyancy for this hovering"
12933,NOTES,"childhood, and kept the angels and the loves aloft, as though they shook"

12940,NOTES,The whole nobility.’

12945,NOTES,
12946,NOTES,"Lovelace, who loved freedom, seems to be enclosed in so narrow a book;"
12947,NOTES,yet it is but a ‘hermitage.’  To shake out the light and spirit of its
12948,NOTES,"leaves is to give a glimpse of liberty not to him, but to the world."
12949,NOTES,
12950,NOTES,"In _To Lucasta_ I have been bold to alter, at the close, ‘you’ to ‘thou.’"
12951,NOTES,"Lovelace sent his verses out unrevised, and the inconsistency of pronouns"
12952,NOTES,"is common with him, but nowhere else so distressing as in this brief and"
12953,NOTES,"otherwise perfect poem.  The fault is easily set right, and it seems even"
12954,NOTES,"an unkindness not to lend him this redress, offered him here as an act of"
12955,NOTES,comradeship.

12962,NOTES,That errors should abound in the text of Lovelace is the more lamentable
12963,NOTES,because he was apt to make a play of phrases that depend upon the
12964,NOTES,"precision of a comma—nay, upon the precision of the voice in reading."
12965,NOTES,_Lucasta Paying her Obsequies_ is a poem that makes a kind of dainty
12966,NOTES,confusion between the two vestals—the living and the dead; they are
12967,NOTES,"‘equal virgins,’ and you must assign the pronouns carefully to either as"
12968,NOTES,"you read.  This, read twice, must surely be placed amongst the loveliest"
12969,NOTES,of his lovely writings.  It is a joy to meet such a phrase as ‘her brave

12978,NOTES,they be ‘birds’ or ‘gods’ that wanton in the air in the first of these
12979,NOTES,"gallant stanzas?  Bishop Percy shied at ‘gods,’ and with admirable"
12980,NOTES,"judgment suggested ‘birds,’ an amendment adopted by the greater number of"
12981,NOTES,"succeeding editors, until one or two wished for the other phrase again,"
12982,NOTES,as an audacity fit for Lovelace.  But the Bishop’s misgiving was after
12983,NOTES,"all justified by one of the MSS. of the poem, in which the ‘gods’ proved"
12984,NOTES,"to be ‘birds’ long before he changed them.  The reader may ask, what is"
12985,NOTES,there to choose between birds so divine and gods so light?  But to begin
12986,NOTES,with ‘gods’ would be to make an anticlimax of the close.  Lovelace led

12999,NOTES,"‘He earned the glorious name,’ says a biographer of Andrew Marvell"
13000,NOTES,"(editing an issue of that post’s works which certainly has its faults),"
13001,NOTES,‘of the British Aristides.’  The portly dulness of the mind that could
13002,NOTES,"make such a phrase, and having made, award it, is not, in fairness, to"
13003,NOTES,affect a reader’s thought of Marvell himself nor even of his time.  Under
13004,NOTES,"correction, I should think that the award was not made in his own age; he"
13005,NOTES,did but live on the eve of the day that cumbered its mouth with phrases
13006,NOTES,of such foolish burden and made literature stiff with them.  Andrew
13007,NOTES,"Marvell’s political rectitude, it is true, seems to have been of a"
13008,NOTES,"robustious kind; but his poetry, at its rare best, has a ‘wild civility,’"
13009,NOTES,"which might puzzle the triumph of him, whoever he was, who made a success"
13010,NOTES,"of this phrase of the ‘British Aristides.’  Nay, it is difficult not to"
13011,NOTES,"think that Marvell too, who was ‘of middling stature, roundish-faced,"
13012,NOTES,"cherry-cheeked,’ a healthy and active rather than a spiritual Aristides,"
13013,NOTES,might himself have been somewhat taken by surprise at the encounters of
13014,NOTES,"so subtle a muse.  He, as a garden-poet, expected the accustomed Muse to"
13015,NOTES,"lurk about the fountain-heads, within the caves, and by the walks and the"
13016,NOTES,"statues of the gods, keeping the tryst of a seventeenth century"
13017,NOTES,convention in which there were certainly no surprises.  And for fear of
13018,NOTES,"the commonplaces of those visits, Marvell sometimes outdoes the whole"
13019,NOTES,company of garden-poets in the difficult labours of the fancy.  The
13020,NOTES,"reader treads with him a ‘maze’ most resolutely intricate, and is more"
13021,NOTES,"than once obliged to turn back, having been too much puzzled on the way"
13022,NOTES,"to a small, visible, plain, and obvious goal of thought."
13023,NOTES,
13024,NOTES,And yet this poet two or three times did meet a Muse he had hardly looked
13025,NOTES,for among the trodden paths; a spiritual creature had been waiting behind
13026,NOTES,a laurel or an apple-tree.  You find him coming away from such a divine
13027,NOTES,ambush a wilder and a simpler man.  All his garden had been made ready
13028,NOTES,"for poetry, and poetry was indeed there, but in unexpected hiding and in"
13029,NOTES,"a strange form, looking rather like a fugitive, shy of the poet who was"
13030,NOTES,"conscious of having her rules by heart, yet sweetly willing to be seen,"
13031,NOTES,for all her haste.
13032,NOTES,
13033,NOTES,"The political poems, needless to say, have an excellence of a different"
13034,NOTES,character and a higher degree.  They have so much authentic dignity that
13035,NOTES,‘the glorious name of the British Aristides’ really seems duller when it
13036,NOTES,is conferred as the earnings of the _Horatian Ode upon Cromwell’s Return
13037,NOTES,"from Ireland_ than when it inappropriately clings to Andrew Marvell,"
13038,NOTES,"cherry-cheeked, caught in the tendrils of his vines and melons.  He shall"
13039,NOTES,"be, therefore, the British Aristides in those moments of midsummer"

13046,NOTES,mad labour fished the land to shore.’  The Satire on ‘Flecno’ makes the
13047,NOTES,"utmost of another joke we know of—that of famine.  Flecno, it will be"
13048,NOTES,"remembered, was a poet, and poor; but the joke of his bad verses was"
13049,NOTES,"hardly needed, so fine does Marvell find that of his hunger.  Perhaps"

13239,NOTES,nature that they must ever stand as obstacles to the straightforward view
13240,NOTES,of sensitive eyes upon the natural world.  Wordsworth shows us the ruins
13241,NOTES,"of an aspen-wood, a blighted hollow, a dreary place forlorn because an"
13242,NOTES,"innocent creature, hunted, had there broken its heart in a leap from the"

13253,NOTES,
13254,NOTES,"‘The Being that is in the clouds and air,"
13255,NOTES,"That is in the green leaves among the groves,"

13257,NOTES,For the unoffending creature whom He loves.’
13258,NOTES,
13259,NOTES,"We must shut our ears because the poet offers us, as a proof of that"
13260,NOTES,"‘reverential care,’ the visible alteration of nature at the scene of"
13261,NOTES,suffering—an alteration we are obliged to dispense with every day we pass

13302,NOTES,through _The Ancient Mariner_ we see them like apparitions.  It is a pity
13303,NOTES,that he followed the pranks also of a dream when he impossibly placed a

13310,NOTES,The likeness of ‘the ribbed sea sand’ is said to be the one passage

13312,NOTES,have written _The Ancient Mariner_ with Coleridge—‘and perhaps the most
13313,NOTES,"beautiful passage in the poem,’ adds one critic after another.  It is no"
13314,NOTES,"more than a good likeness, and has nothing whatever of the indescribable"
13315,NOTES,Coleridge quality.
13316,NOTES,
13317,NOTES,"Coleridge reveals, throughout this poem, an exaltation of the senses,"
13318,NOTES,which is the most poetical thing that can befall a simple poet.  It is
13319,NOTES,"necessary only to refer, for sight, to the stanza on ‘the moving Moon’ at"
13320,NOTES,"the bottom of page 267; for hearing, to the supernatural stanzas on page"

13347,NOTES,The profounder spirit of Shelley’s poem yet leaves it a careless piece of
13348,NOTES,work in comparison with Byron’s.  The two false rhymes at the outset may
13349,NOTES,"not be of great importance, but there is something annoying in the"
13350,NOTES,dissyllabic rhymes of the second stanza.  Dissyllabic rhymes are
13351,NOTES,"beautiful and enriching when they fall in the right place; that is, where"
13352,NOTES,"there is a pause for the second little syllable to stand.  For example,"
13353,NOTES,they could not be better placed than they would have been at the end of
13354,NOTES,"the shorter lines of this same stanza, where they would have dropped into"
13355,NOTES,a part of the pause.  Another sin of sheer heedlessness—the lapse of
13356,NOTES,"grammar in _The Skylark_, at the top of page 296—will remind the reader"
13357,NOTES,of the special habitual error of Drummond of Hawthornden.

13388,NOTES,"Keats is here the magical poet, as he is the intellectual poet in the"
13389,NOTES,great sonnet following; and it is his possession or promise of both
13390,NOTES,imaginations that proves him greater than Coleridge.  In his day they
13391,NOTES,seem to have found Coleridge to be a thinker in his poetry.  To me he
13392,NOTES,"seems to have had nothing but senses, magic, and simplicity, and these he"
13393,NOTES,had to the utmost yet known to man.  Keats was to have been a great
13394,NOTES,"intellectual poet, besides all that in fact he was."

13400,NOTES,
13401,NOTES,"Of the five odes of Keats, the _Nightingale_ is perhaps the most perfect,"
13402,NOTES,"and certainly the most imaginative.  But the _Grecian Urn_ is the finest,"
13403,NOTES,"even though it has fancy rather than imagination, for never was fancy"
13404,NOTES,more exquisite.  The most conspicuous idea—the emptying of the town
13405,NOTES,because its folk are away at play in the tale of the antique urn—is
13406,NOTES,"merely a fancy, and a most antic fancy—a prank; it is an irony of man, a"
13407,NOTES,"rallying of art, a mockery of time, a burlesque of poetry, divine with"
13408,NOTES,tenderness.  The six lines in which this fancy sports are amongst the
13409,NOTES,"loveliest in all literature: the ‘little town,’ the ‘peaceful"
13410,NOTES,"citadel,’—were ever simple adjectives more happy?  But John Keats’s final"
13411,NOTES,moral here is undeniably a failure; it says so much and means so little.
13412,NOTES,"The _Ode to Autumn_ is an exterior ode, and not in so high a rank, but"
13413,NOTES,"lovely and perfect.  The _Psyche_ I love the least, because its fancy is"
13414,NOTES,rather weak and its sentiment effusive.  It has a touch of the deadly
13415,NOTES,sickliness of _Endymion_.  None the less does it remain just within the
13416,NOTES,group of the really fine odes of English poets.  The eloquent
13417,NOTES,_Melancholy_ more narrowly escapes exclusion from that group.
